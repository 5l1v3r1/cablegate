SUBJECT: FRANCE: CONCERN OVER USG FUNDING FOR ITER 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  France strongly supports the ITER (International 
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) "clean" nuclear fusion based 
project that if successfully developed would produce much 
electricity with little radioactive waste.  In addition to providing 
 
the ITER site, France has allocated 900 million euros toward ITER's 
original 5 billion euro cost, and an additional 60 million euros for 
auxiliary infrastructure.  Now the project needs 1 billion euros 
more to pay for critical design changes, thus delaying operations 
until at least 2019. Despite international commitments, the U.S. 
Department of Energy has not received budget authorization to supply 
equipment designed and manufactured in the U.S. nor to pay ITER 
operating expenses.  These shortfalls could severely stresses the 
ITER project and raise questions about our reliability as an 
international research partner.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ITER: Dedication of Resources 
----------------------------- 
¶2. (U) The French actively campaigned successfully for the ITER site 
in Cadarache, about 50 miles northeast of Marseille, committing 895 
million euros to site development, construction and the enlarged 
highway to carry heavy equipment from the Port of Marseille. In 
addition, local Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (PACA) governments are 
providing 60 million euros in auxiliary infrastructure, support for 
international school construction, and additional road construction. 
 In October 2008, with only site preparation under way, a scientific 
advisory panel informed the partners that an additional 1.2 billion 
to 1.6 billion euros over the original 5 billion euro cost would be 
needed to pay for critical design changes.  These changes will delay 
ITER completion for up to three years past the 2018 due date. 
 
ITER: European Steadfast Financial Support 
------------------------------------------ 
¶3. (U) In 2005, ITER direct construction costs were estimated at 5.5 
billion euros, of which 45 percent would be provided by Europe and 
55 percent by the six other Parties (China, the Republic of Korea, 
the United States, Russia, India, and Japan), each contributing 9 
percent.  Of Europe's share, France contributes 496 million Euros in 
first phase costs, and 8 percent of second phase costs.  The EU 
budget covers the remaining European commitments not paid by France. 
 In addition, of the 678 million Euros enlarged roadway cost, France 
is paying 25 percent or 170 million euros, with the remainder 
divided between Japan (50 percent) and other European countries. 
 
Difficulty in U.S. Financial Commitment to ITER 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶4. (SBU) Originally the USG pledged to contribute USD 1.12 billion 
between 2008 and 2014 mainly in in-kind shipments of equipment and 
components as well as a small amount in cash for ITER secretariat 
expenses.  However, so far, the Congress has appropriated only 
modest amounts, far below the pledge level.  In FY 2008, only USD 
26.1 million was appropriated towards a request of USD 160 million. 
The FY 2008 funding reduction sharply curtailed U.S. design, R and D 
activities and procurement, reduced the U.S.-based project staff to 
a core team, and precluded an approximately USD 11 million cash 
payment.  With the Continuing Resolution in FY 2009 the ITER Project 
received an additional USD 5.3 million.  Total USG funding for ITER 
to date has been USD 110.7 million.  USG funds on hand will be 
exhausted in March. The USG shortfall compounds ITER's challenges, 
and further compounds a reliability issue first raised when the USG 
first pulled out of the ITER project in 1999. 
 
Work in Progress: The ITER School 
--------------------------------- 
¶5. (U) The ITER School, located in the town of Manosque, nearby to 
Cadarache, has enrolled a little over 200 students during its second 
year of operation; under half of those students come from ITER 
families, while the rest are from the local community.  There are 
reportedly 58 teachers on staff, representing 13 nationalities. 
Although the proportion of instruction in French has been relaxed 
somewhat, there is still some dissatisfaction among the non-European 
ITER parents about the lack of an International Baccalaureate (IB) 
Diploma program and only a French Baccalaureate program for high 
school students.  Currently only one American elementary student is 
enrolled.  Curriculum and class materials are still generally below 
standards and logistics remains a problem as the school is 
approximately 60 kilometers (40 miles) from the ITER housing sites 
and there is a lack of adequate transportation.
