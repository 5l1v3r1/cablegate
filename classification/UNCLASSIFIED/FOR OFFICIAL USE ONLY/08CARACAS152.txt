Treat Accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a February 4 speech celebrating the 16th 
anniversary of his attempted 1992 coup (Septel), Chavez 
threatened to expropriate large food distributors and 
producers.  Chavez said, "I have ordered Mr. Vice-President 
Colonel Ramon Carrizales and my government to go on the 
offensive.  It's not enough to close one store, and even less 
fair to close small businesses; no, we are going after the 
big ones.  We are going to keep an eye on the big ones, that 
is where capitalism is at its fiercest, and the owners of 
these large chains are members of the rancid anti-Bolivarian 
oligarchy."  Chavez added, "I hope they (the large food 
distributors and producers) give me the excuse to intervene 
and expropriate them, so I can put those food and medicine 
chains at the service of the Venezuelan people, and not the 
oligarchy." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Chavez' most recent expropriation threats 
appear to be aimed at Polar, Venezuela's largest food 
processing company.  During the period of January 21 - 23, 
the Venezuelan National Guard seized more than 500 tons of 
food produced by Polar, claiming that the food was being 
smuggled illegally to Colombia or "hoarded." (Reftel). 
According to Polar representatives, the confiscated trucks, 
traveling along their normal routes, were carrying finished 
goods for Venezuela's western states.  End Comment.
