SUBJECT: PRT GHAZNI - TALIBAN NIGHT LETTERS DISTRIBUTED IN GHAZNI 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  As seen in other provinces around Afghanistan, 
"night letters" issuing death threats to Afghan National Army (ANA) 
members, Afghan National Police (ANP), and Afghan women employed by 
U.S. PRT's and "any other foreigners", have surfaced around Ghazni 
City.  Translations of two such letters issued on or about September 
9 are included in paras 5 and 6 .  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) Two "night letters" were reportedly distributed in Ghazni 
City by a motorcycle rider on or about the evening of September 9. 
Printed by computer in good Dari grammar, the letters are typical of 
the night letters distributed by Taliban agents or sympathizers in 
Ghazni province. 
 
¶3.  (U) The letters and other forms of intimidation appear to have 
had some intended effect.  In a recent meeting, a number of Ghazni 
district Chiefs of Police cited threats against officers and their 
families as a major reason for the shortage of police recruits and a 
low retention rate.  The (female) Director of Education in Ghazni 
has been threatened a number of times in the past few months. 
(Note: This Director of Education is a member of the Hazara ethnic 
group, and it is unclear whether threats against her are because she 
is a woman, a Hazara, the Director of Education, or any combination 
of the above.  End note.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) These recent night letters were passed to the PRT by the 
former Governor, Sher Alam.  In handing them over, Alam  berated the 
recently removed Provincial Chief of Police, General Tafseer, whom 
he did not regard highly.  Governor Alam noted that while a number 
of citizens reported seeing the letters being distributed, the 
police had not witnessed this action. The Governor criticized the 
police for not performing patrols at night. 
 
¶5.  (U) Text of first night letter (direct translation of text by 
PRT):  Warning to the Servants of ANA and ANP from Brave Mujadeen: 
To the servants and traitors who sell their soul to work and help 
American and other foreigners and are very happy to be their 
servants.  To all of the people who stand next to our enemy against 
their country and nation and sell their faith and their country, 
this you last warning.  If you do not stay away from our enemy and 
do not stop being servants for American or our enemy, Mujadeen for 
Freedom will, with sword of fairness of Islam, cut their head from 
their body.  Soldiers of ANA and ANP you should and must know very 
well you cannot serve if front of the sword of right and freedom. 
If you do not quit this shameless job you will be sent to hell.  End 
text. 
 
¶6.  Text of second night letter:  Warning to the Woman Working with 
Americans or Any Other Foreigner:  To the women without conscience 
to sell their soul because of money, happiness and have fun with 
American men and working and helping them.  If they do not stop 
selling themselves and stop working with them in the very near 
future they will see what will happen to them.  For their punishment 
expect death and nothing else.  This is the last warning.  If they 
do not stop working on the bases and offices we do not see any 
solution, except death.  End text.
