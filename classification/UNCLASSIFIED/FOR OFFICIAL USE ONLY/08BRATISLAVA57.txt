Â¶1. (SBU) With both the Director and the Deputy Director of 
the MFA's Middle East Bureau away, Pol/Econ Chief delivered 
reftel demarche to Beata Urbanova, Desk Officer for Syria and 
Lebanon, on February 7. Urbanova underscored strong GOS 
support for the Siniora government, but was unable during the 
meeting to provide substantive responses to the specific 
points raised in the demarche.  Urbanova did comment, 
however, that she thought it would be difficult to gain 
approval for a financial pledge for the Special Tribunal by 
February 14. Post will follow up with more senior officials 
(and with Ministry of Defense) during the week of February 11 
and recommends that the issue be raised with Foreign Minister 
Kubis during his upcoming meeting with the Deputy Secretary.
