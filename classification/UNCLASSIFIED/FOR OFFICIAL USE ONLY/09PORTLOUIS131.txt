ATTENDEE FOR 2009 PLENARY MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 35549 
 
¶1. (SBU) On April 20, Charge d'Affaires and the Russian 
Ambassador jointly delivered ref points and agenda to 
Mauritian Foreign Minister Arvin Boolell and Ambassador 
Patrice Cure, head of the Multi-Lateral Division at the MFA. 
Both were pleased to receive the updated information, but 
noted that, while the GOM planned to attend, they had not yet 
decided who would travel to the plenary meetings. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 30, the Charge made a follow-up call to 
Ambassador Cure.  Although Boolell had promised to provide a 
name to the USG and GOR by 29 April, Cure indicated that no 
decision had been taken on Government of Mauritius 
participation in the 2009 Plenary Meeting at the Hague.  When 
pressed, he pleaded the movement of the Ministry to a new 
building, and said he could not have an answer until perhaps 
as late as the following week. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post recognizes the GOM reply means ref deadline 
can not be met and, despite assurances from the Foreign 
Minister, believe it possible that, in the end, the GOM will 
not send a representative.  Post will provide updates, as 
available.
