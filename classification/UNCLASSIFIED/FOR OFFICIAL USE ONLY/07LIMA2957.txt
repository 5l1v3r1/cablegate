SUBJECT: EARTHQUAKE RELIEF: A BOOST TO PERU-CHILE 
RELATIONS, BLACK EYE FOR VENEZUELA 
 
REF: LIMA 2860 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The August 15 earthquake has provided an 
unexpected boost to the Garcia administration's relations 
with key regional allies while raising public suspicion about 
the motives behind Venezuelan aid.  Chile in particular has 
deftly used its high-profile relief effort to quiet the 
flare-up over the longstanding bilateral maritime dispute. 
Colombia, Brazil, and Bolivia all stepped in with supply 
shipments and high-level visits -- to positive public 
relations effect.  Venezuela, by contrast, has been forced to 
claim that tuna cans bearing images of President Chavez were 
fakes and to protest accusations that it was seeking 
political advantage in tragedy.  End Summary. 
 
Chile-Peru: Co/"(Ucted boost to the Government of Peru's 
relations with key neighbors -- Chile in particular.  The 
week before, headlines had featured the most recent flare-up 
of the supposed maritime border dispute between the two 
countries, complete with Chile's temporary recall of its 
Ambassador in protest.  Soon after the earthquake, Chile had 
once again become Peru's friend and partner, and the hastily 
returned Chilean Ambassador the coordinator-in-chief of 
Chile's emergency relief effort.  This effort included at 
least two plane loads of emergency supplies and a high-level 
GOC delegation, led by presidential spokesman Ricardo Lagos 
Weber, to highlight Chilean goodwill.  In response, President 
Garcia publicly acknowledged Chilean support, and on August 
22 traveled from Pisco to the Chilean border to inaugurate 
the newly built customs post there.  In public remarks from 
the border, Garcia called for both countries to look "beyond 
our legal challenges" in order to create a region where 
goods, people and cultural influences flow freely. 
 
Regional Partners Step Up 
------------------------- 

¶3. (U) Colombia and Brazil also responded rapidly to the 
crisis with aid and high-profile shows of support.  In 
addition to providing tons of fo36mASQL/2EOelevision images showed President Uribe touring the area 
alongside his friend Garcia.  Brazil likewise sent tons of 
supplies, and Foreign Minister Celso Amorim left scheduled 
meetings in Lima to meet Garcia and tour Pisco.  Even 
Bolivia's Evo Morales traveled to Pisco August 25 to deliver 
an aid shipment amid declarations of solidarity with his 
Peruvian brothers. 
 
Tuna Cans and Venezuela's Black Eye 
----------------------------------- 

¶4. (SBU) Cuban assistance has reportedly been targeted and 
effective, if not directly coordinated with the GOP.  Cuba 
has sent at least two field hospital teams that have offered 
high-impact quality service, according to observers.  At one 
camp where a U.S. Medrete team had been sent to provide 
services, a CubaN&team had already been set up.  The Cuban 
team said that they followed the orders of the Cuban 
Ambassador and did not coordinate with Peru's Ministry of 
Health, as the Americans did. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) As for Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez promised 
early and publicly to deliver 120 tons of supplies, and 
reportedly delivered two planeloads several days after the 
earthquake. But subsequent developments have overshadowed the 
quick and enthusiastic start.  Emboffs on site in Pisco noted 
that Venezuelan planes remained in place for more than 24 
hours, as virtual backdrops for repeated photo opportunities, 
while those of other countries, including the U.S., landed 
and took off again in earnest substantive effort.  More 
damning still were media reports that aJvQ:QQ'V ala.  Pictures of the offending can appeared in 
several major dailies, unleashing a barrage of accusations 
that Venezuela was seeking political advantage in Peru's 
suffering.  Whatever the veracity of these reports -- and 
there is widespread speculation that the pictures were faked 
-- both Chavez and Humala were forced on the defensive and 
have issued vehement denials.  According to late August news 
reports, Chavez accused the U.S. of planting the story in 
order to undermine Venezuela's image in Peru. 
 
Comment: The Politics of Earthquake Relief 
------------------------------------------ 

¶6. (SBU) While the earthquake was first and foremost a 
humanitarian tragedy, it has had inescapable political 
consequences, domestic and regional.  On the domestic front, 
President Garcia scored early points by immediately 
dispatching key Ministers and traveling himself to Pisco to 
assume command of the rescue operation on site (ref).  Since 
that time, there has been grumbling that the cabinet has 
inadvertently gummed up the effectiveness of the initial 
humanitarian response.  Whatever the case, the sensitive 
politics of post-earthquake Peru speak powerfully for a 
quiet, well coordinated relief effort that aims for real and 
long-term results rather than immediate public relations 
gains.
