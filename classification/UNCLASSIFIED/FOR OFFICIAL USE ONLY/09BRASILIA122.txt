Ministry of External Relations (MRE), Division for the Sea, 
Antarctica and Space, the diplomatic note (no. 49), per REFTEL, 
agreeing to the Brazilian proposal that the U.S.-Brazil Framework 
Agreement on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space be

Mr. Ambassador, 
 
I have the honor to refer to the Framework Agreement between the 
Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Government 
of the United States of America on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses 
of Outer Space, signed in Brasilia, on the first day of March, 1996, 
which was extended until January 31, 2009, through the exchange of 
Notes. 
 
¶2.  In that respect, I propose that the Framework Agreement, in 
accordance with Article 13, be extended for another year, until 
January 31, 2010. 
 
¶3.  If the proposed extension is acceptable to the Government of the 
United States of America, this Note and the note from Your 
Excellency in which acceptance is expressed will constitute an 
agreement between our Governments for the extension of the 
aforementioned Framework Agreement, which will go into effect on the 
date of the Note with the response from Your Excellency. 
 
¶4.  I would like to take this opportunity to renew to you the 
assurances of my highest consideration.
