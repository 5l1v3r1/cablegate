¶1. (U) We greatly appreciate the opportunity to host the USS 
Kearsarge and welcome the request to provide a foreign policy 
advisor (POLAD) to the Command Element during its upcoming 
deployment to Nicaragua.  Nicaragua's spot at the front of 
the deployment requires that we staff the POLAD position for 
nearly the entire month of August.  Given the length of this 
mission and the fact it falls in the midst of our peak Summer 
rotation schedule, the Country Team has decided to divide the 
assignment between two officers. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Our Deputy Political Counselor, Jesse Curtis, will 
plan to meet the ship in Miami NLT August 8 and ride the ship 
home.  Mr. Curtis will remain on the ship until o/a August 16 
when he will be relieved by Political Officer Michael Garcia, 
who will remain on-board until relieved by POLAD from Embassy 
Bogota. 
 
¶3.  (U) Embassy Managua POC is Dep Political Counselor, Jesse 
Curtis.  email:  CurtisJS@state.sgov.gov; CurtisJS@state.gov;
