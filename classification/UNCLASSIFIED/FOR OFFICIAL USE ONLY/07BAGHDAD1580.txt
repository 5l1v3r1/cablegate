SUBJECT:  THE KURDISTAN ISLAMIC GROUP IN SULAIMANIYAH, IRAQI 
KURDISTAN 
 
This is a Regional Reconstruction Team (RRT) Cable. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Kurdistan Islamic Group (KIG) members told 
RRTOff that they would like to increase the dialogue on a range of 
issues between the KIG and USG.  They similarly said they wanted to 
see more USG engagement with moderate Islamic political parties in 
Kurdistan and more broadly in Iraq.  The KIG was associated in the 
past with the terrorist group Ansar al-Islam but says it now rejects 
violence and extremism and supports the demilitarization of 
political parties and the development of effective anti-corruption 
programs.  END SUMMARY 
 
-------------- 
BACKGROUND 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On March 29, RRTOff met in Sulaimaniyah with two members 
of the KIG, Mohmad H. Jabar and Anwar FarajSaddon.  Jabar is also a 
member of the PRovincial Council of Sulaimaniyah Province. 
Established in May of 2001, the KIG is led by Mamousta Ali Baper, a 
former member of the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan.  (Note:  KIG 
leader Baper was arrested in 2003 by US forces and released in 
2005.)  The KIG adheres to a Salafi or Sufi tradition.  KIG members 
say they focus on learning and negotiation to promote progress and 
conflict resolution.  The KIG members told RRTOff they support the 
rights of women, due process, and freedom from torture. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In 2005 during the Iraqi legislative elections, KIG joined 
the coalition that included the two dominant parties in Iraqi 
Kurdistan, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan (PUK).  The KIG obtained six seats in the 
Kurdistan National Assembly and two seats in the Iraqi Council of 
Representatives.  KIG member estimate they have 90,000 supporters in 
the three provinces of the Iraqi Kurdistan region. 
 
¶4.  (SUB) The KIG was previously associated with the terrorist group 
Ansar al-Islam, but denies that such an association is valid today. 
Some of the KIG members were killed or injured in the US-led raid 
against Ansal al-Islam in March 2003 along the Iranian border in 
Sulaimaniyah Province.  The KIG originated in Sulaimaniyah Province 
where it has received funding from the dominant political party 
there - the PUK.  The KIG interlocutors specified, however, that 
current legislation governing political parties stipulated that 
support is from the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and not from 
the PUK.  However, since the major parties (PUK and KDP) control the 
government, the PUK continues to claim it support the KIG.  The KIG 
also relies on dues from party members to finance its operation. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
A MODEL FOR POLITICAL DEMILITARIZATION? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) KIG members told RRTOff that they condemned the terrorist 
attacks of September 11.  The KIG underscored the need to 
demilitarize Iraqi political parties and build their country without 
weapons.  They said this is why KIG party members turned in their 
weapons to the US in 2003 and were the only Iraqi party to do so. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
USG SHOULD "ENGAGE MORE WITH MODERATE ISLAMIC PARTIES" 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  KIG members were appreciative of the opportunity to meet 
with RRTOff and said they would like more and continued access to 
USG officials to express their views directly.  They stated that a 
single meeting with USG officials with no follow-up would not be 
sufficient and asked RRTOff for assistance.  RRTOff offered to help 
put them in contact with National Democratic Institute and 
International Republic Institute. They offered to arrange a meeting 
in Erbil between RRTOff and the national president of the KIG. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The KIG members emphasized the legitimate role that 
moderate Islamic parties in Iraq have in the political process.  KIG 
members expressed the view that the US should distinguish between 
moderate Islamic parties and terrorist groups.  Terrorist groups, 
they continued, are present in response to problems in Iraqi 
politics and in reaction to Western attitudes.  According to these 
KIG members, the West should better understand the motives of the 
terrorists and what they are fighting for.  If the US continues to 
look at all Islamic parties as extremists, they pointed out, this 
could drive more Islamists to engage in terrorist activities. 
 
----------------------------------- 
SEEKING REFORM IN KURDISH POLITICS 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The KIG members asserted that their low representation in 
the Kurdistan National Assembly makes it difficult to fight 
corruption within the KRG and within the KDP and PUK.  KIG members

complained that it is difficult to stand up against the PUK and KDP 
to create democratic processes related to elections, the media, and 
press.  Unlike the KIG, the PUK and KDP have financial security and 
military power, they said.  The KRG budget is controlled by the 
major parties and smaller parties are entitled to only a small 
portion.  The KIG members stated the PUK and KDP use the problem of 
limiting KRG funding as a pressure to constrict KIG activities in 
the region. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) COMMENT.  The KIG's message of anti-corruption and 
democratization may garner additional support for the party over 
time.  However, it will remain an uphill battle to loosen the 
lock-hold the KDP and PUK continue to have over Kurdish regional 
politics.  The KDP and PUK have included the KIG in their 
national-level coalition, but thus far have squeezed it out of a 
more political and economic role either in Baghdad or in Erbil.
