directed that two former crossing employees return to 
Karni/al-Mintar June 28 to manage the receipt of the wheat

ICRC Meets With Haniyah

to support ICRC's operations in Gaza.  Ritz said that 17 sick

------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Current through-put at Kerem Shalom has been 
limited to an estimated 25 truckloads per day.  WFP's

be increased to an estimated 100 trucks per day if the paved 
surface where Palestinians pick-up cargo was expanded from 
100 to 400 square meters, creating additional space to load 
more trucks.
