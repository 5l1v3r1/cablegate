SUBJECT: Dead birds in Guangzhou confirmed positive for H5N1 virus, 
avian influenza 
 
REF: A. Guangzhou 0154 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: The National Influenza Reference Laboratory has 
confirmed that the March 13 death of 114 chickens in a Guangzhou 
poultry market was the result of the H5N1 virus (avian influenza). 
Guangdong authorities have increased disinfection and monitoring 
efforts. The infected birds have been traced to an unlicensed 
wholesale poultry market in Foshan, which has subsequently culled 
2,000 birds, tested an additional 82,000 plus, and halted market 
operations. No additional cases of H5N1 infection have been 
reported. End Summary.

Avian Influenza Confirmed 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) During a March 13 incident, in a Guangzhou poultry market, a 
total of 114 birds died from unknown causes. Authorities ordered an 
additional 518 to be culled, one of several steps exercised as part 
of the provincial government's prevention and response plan, which 
is activated when avian influenza is suspected (ref. A).  On March 
16, following tests conducted by the National Avian Influenza 
Reference Laboratory (located in Harbin) on poultry samples 
collected from the Guangzhou market, the Guangdong Ministry of 
Agriculture confirmed that the deaths were a result of highly 
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of the H5N1 subtype.  As part of 
the provincial response plan, disinfection and monitoring efforts 
have been strengthened for poultry markets located within a 3-km 
radius of the infection site.  Additionally, market sellers who were 
in close contact with the infected poultry remain under medical 
observation.  The Guangdong HPAI Command Center has circulated a 
memo urging local government to be vigilant in their 100 percent 
vaccination policy, and in their promotion of quarantine 
certificates.  No additional AI-related poultry deaths have been 
reported. 
 
¶3. (U) Also, in an unrelated case, authorities have confirmed that 
the death of more than 3,000 birds in Foshan City's Tingbu Village 
(ref. A), located 2 hours southwest of Guangzhou, can be attributed 
to the overuse of antibiotics, not to the H5N1 virus.  According to 
investigations conducted by the Foshan Veterinary Section, and the 
Animal Disease Prevention and Control Center, a farmer previously 
purchased the antibiotic Gentamicin, used to treat bacterial 
infections, and subsequently administered a dosage three-times the 
normal level to his farm's poultry.  Additionally, he mixed the 
antibiotics into the poultry feed, instead of properly administering 
the drugs into the water. As a result, many of his birds died.

Contaminated Supply 
------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Since March 13, stalls in Guangzhou's Jinhua Xin Market 
have been disinfected daily, and remain banned from selling poultry 
at this time.  Stalls selling other goods in the market are 
operating as normal.  Following provincial government investigations 
into the origination point of the infected poultry, authorities have 
discovered that the dead chickens were obtained from an unlicensed 
wholesale market, Sanniao market, located in Foshan City's Nanhai 
district.  According to the Ministry of Agriculture, 2,000 birds in 
the wholesale market were culled as a precautionary measure. 
Additional reports indicate that more than 82,000 of the wholesale 
market's birds tested negative for the H5N1 virus, though this claim 
has yet to be confirmed.  The wholesale market purchases its poultry 
supply from Beiliu, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. On March 14, 
local officials suspended the wholesale market's operations for 
operating without a license.
