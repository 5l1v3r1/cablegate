SUBJECT: GUIDANCE: ECOSOC RESOLUTION ON REPERCUSSIONS OF 
OCCUPATION, JULY 28 
 
REF: ROSS-GOLDSTEIN EMAIL OF 7/20/09 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. 
 
¶2. (SBU) USUN should call for a vote and vote "no" on an 
ECOSOC resolution on the "economic and social repercussions 
of the Israeli occupation on the living conditions of the 
Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory," 
which will be presented the afternoon of July 28.  The draft 
resolution is unbalanced and, therefore, unacceptable. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As warranted, USUN may draw from the previous USG 
explanation of vote on this issue (REF), modifying it to 
reflect textual differences in the current resolution.  The 
previous explanation of vote highlighted, in part, the 
following: 
 
-- The U.S. appreciates that the draft resolution highlights 
the importance of good governance, ensuring the safety and 
well-being of civilians, and halting all acts of violence, 
but will nevertheless vote against the resolution as it is 
fatally unbalanced, criticizing Israel while ignoring the 
targeting of civilians by Palestinian terrorists. 
-- We regret the violent loss of lives of both Palestinian 
and Israeli citizens. 
-- Moreover, the U.S. remains deeply concerned about the 
impact of the current humanitarian crisis on the entire 
Palestinian population. 
-- The U.S. remains committed to working with the Quartet and 
with regional states to move both parties forward towards the 
achievement of two states, living side-by-side in peace and 
security.  The focus of the international community should be 
on helping both parties maintain progress toward that shared 
objective. 
-- One-sided resolutions only serve to undermine the ability 
of the United Nations to play a constructive role in 
furthering peace.
