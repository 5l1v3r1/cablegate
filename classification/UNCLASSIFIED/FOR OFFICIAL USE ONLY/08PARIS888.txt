SUBJECT: FRANCE: G8 INITIATIVE ON TERRORIST ABUSE OF CHARITIES 
 
REFS: A) STATE 46472 B) LAMBERT-BLIN/ROIGNAN EMAIL 
 
In follow-up to EEB ref B e-mail demarche on the terrorist abuse of 
charities initiative (subsequently received ref A), MFA 
Counterterrorism chief Louis Blin indicated the GOF had issues with 
the proposed U.S. action plan. Blin wouldn't elaborate, saying only 
that an interagency working group including the Foreign Affairs, 
Economy and Interior Ministries had prepared the French position and 
that FASS Christian Masset would be briefed prior to the Kyoto 
meeting.  We also highlighted the issue for DAS-equivalent for 
International Finance Cyrille Pierre on the margins of a May 5 
pull-aside between A/S Sullivan and Masset (where the topic was not 
raised).
