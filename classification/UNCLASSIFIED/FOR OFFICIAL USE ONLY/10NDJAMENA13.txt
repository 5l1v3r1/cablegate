SUMMARY 
AND COMMENT 
----------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Chadian justice system showed itself capable of 
asserting impartial authority in a highly partisan environment, and 
of carrying out due process and defending press freedom, when the 
GOC's Justice Ministry decided Jan 6 to authorize the troubled 
independent Chadian weekly "La Voix" to resume  publication.  "La 
Voix," whose owner is a prominent lawyer and opposition figure, was 
ordered to suspend publication last month because it failed to 
comply with Chadian law requiring payment of registration fees, and 
also as a consequence of the irregular residence status of its 
Cameroonian editor.  Local and international press reports 
proliferated, charging that the GoC was trying to close down "La 
Voix" because of its opposition stance and criticism of President 
Deby's policies, and alleging that its editor and another staff 
member had been "disappeared" by unknown armed men. 
 
 ¶2. (SBU)  Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to find any 
evidence of disappearance or kidnapping of "La Voix" staff.  The 
publication, while professionally produced and edited, and no more 
critical of the GOC than other independent media, seems nevertheless 
to have played into the hands of partisan elements in the GoC by 
mismanaging its own legal affairs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The positive outcome of the case demonstrates that justice 
can prevail in Chad, and that the Justice Ministry is committed to 
conducting business by the books.  Ordinance 5, the emergency 
measure promulgated during the 2008 rebel attacks to restrict the 
ability of journalists to comment on "the work of security forces," 
was not a factor in the affair of La Voix.  Ironically, the latest 
effort by the Embassy to professionalize Chadian journalists 
emphasized that journalists should avoid giving wary governments 
excuses to interfere with their work by ignoring details like those 
that derailed "La Voix" for a time.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  La Voix's round of troubles began in October 2009, when 
its editor, Innocent Ebode, a Cameroonian national who lacked 
accreditation as a journalist in Chad, was expelled for working 
without proper documentation.  The owner of the paper, Jean-Bertrand 
Padare, a prominent Chadian lawyer (who defended opposition figures 
detained in February 2008), was advised by the GoC's High 
Communications Council (HCC) to seek a Commerce Ministry license to 
publish, but apparently failed to do so.  On December 3, the HCC 
ordered "La Voix" to cease publication until properly licensed, but 
it did not - the last issue of the paper was dated December 31.  On 
December 24, the Justice Minister, Jean Alingue (himself a member of 
the opposition CPDC party coalition), ordered a judicial inquiry 
into La Voix's legal status.  Ebode seems to have been expelled from 
Chad a second time when he attempted to return in December, still 
lacking accreditation.  On January 6, the Justice Ministry lifted 
the order on the paper to cease publication. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The affair of La Voix was complicated by repeated local 
and international allegtions that Ebode and Padare were targeted 
for political reasons, and that the GoC was trying to presure La 
Voix out of existence.  Ebode and the papr's accountant were widely 
reported to have beenabducted and beaten by unknown individuals in 
Deember.  Local human rights activists have told us tat they are 
skeptical of these reports.  One activist recounted a recent meeting 
of the Observation Group for Media Practice and Ethics (ODEMET), an 
independent press "watchdog" to which most Chadian journalists 
belong, where many members accused Padare of creating rumors about 
abuse of his staff by Chadian security forces so as to make his 
paper into a cause celebre.

ORDINANCE FIVE 
NOT A FACTOR 
-------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Ordinance 5, the emergency measure restricting the 
 
NDJAMENA 00000013  002 OF 002 
 
 
ability of journalists to comment on "the work of security forces," 
which was promulgated at the time of rebel attacks in 2008, was not 
a factor in the affair of "La Voix."  The measure remains on the 
books despite pressure from local and international journalists to 
have it rescinded and to make a priority of media freedom in the 
period before legislative elections in 2010.  Although the ordinance 
has never actually been invoked, its existence has left journalists 
uncertain as to how far they can go with critical commentary. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Draft legislation that would rescind Ordinance 5 and 
replace it with a new law on media behavior has been circulating 
among the national Assembly, HCC, Communications Ministry and other 
GoC bodies for many months.  Journalist associations consider the 
current draft replacement text to be as bad as or worse than 
Ordinance 5, in that it specifies prison terms for some types of 
reporting.  There is no consensus on when the text might finally be 
agreed, or whether it would pass were it to be submitted to the 
National Assembly. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  "La Voix" is the newest of five opposition-oriented 
papers in N'Djamena, having been established in May of 2009.  There 
is one paper sympathetic to the government, and a just-launched 
publication run by the author of an opposition website who has 
recently accepted a position with the Office of the National 
Mediator.  Thus far, this publication appears to be relatively 
neutral. 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  A development on the local journalistic scene that 
complements the Justice Ministry's decision to allow "La Voix" to 
publish is the GoC's provision of a new building for the "Maison des 
Medias," an independent journalist-run association that encourages 
adherence to international standards of media ethics.  The current 
focus of the group is on mediation between reporters and citizens 
who believe they have been the victims of libel or inaccurate 
reporting.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10. (SBU)  Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to find any 
evidence of "disappearance" or "kidnapping" of "La Voix" staff.  The 
publication, while professionally produced and edited, and no more 
critical of the GOC than other independent media, seems nevertheless 
to have played into the hands of partisan elements in the GoC by 
mismanaging its own legal affairs. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) The positive outcome of the case demonstrates that 
justice can prevail in Chad, and that the Justice Ministry is 
committed to conducting business by the book.  Ordinance 5, the 
emergency measure promulgated during the 2008 rebel attacks to 
restrict the ability of journalists to comment on "the work of 
security forces," was not a factor in the affair of La Voix. 
Ironically, the latest installment of the Embassy's efforts to 
professionalize Chadian journalists, emphasized that journalists 
avoid giving wary governments good excuses to interfere with their 
professional work by ignoring details like those that derailed "La 
Voix" for a time.  END COMMENT.
