¶1. (SBU) Post delivered demarche points to Foreign Affairs 
Acting Director for North American and Euro-Atlantic Security 
and Defence Relations, Isabelle Poupart, the morning of May 
¶31.  In a follow-up discussion, Poupart said that the matter 
had been resolved earlier in the day in Vienna with agreement 
on acceptable language ("ongoing" role vs. "continued"). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poupart acknowledged that Canada was not too 
enthused about the "personal representative" concept because 
it broke down the problem of discrimination into component 
parts; the Canadian government favored maintaining a more 
"holistic" approach that maintained focus on all aspects of 
discrimination.  Nonetheless, once a decision was taken in 
favor of appointing the personal representatives, Poupart 
continued, Canada was happy to let them finish their mandate 
(end of 2005).  At the same time, she observed, "very little" 
had been heard from the personal representatives to date. 
Canada looked forward to hearing from them in Cordoba. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Poupart speculated that unfounded rumors in Vienna, 
suggesting that Canada and others would seek to terminate the 
mandate of the personal representatives at the Cordoba 
meeting, were contributing factors to the perception that 
Canada was still actively opposing the personal 
representatives.  Moreover, she said that use of the word 
"continued" in the text was confusing, given that the 
representatives were appointed for a one-year term only, and 
"continued" could be taken as pre-judging the outcome of the 
one-year review.  Poupart was unaware of any NGOs contacting 
Foreign Affairs Canada (FAC) about the matter, though she 
indicated that "different Jewish organizations" had 
approached the Canadian mission in Vienna.
