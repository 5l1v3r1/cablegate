¶1. (SBU) Summary: In response to Chadian military bombing along the 
West Darfur border, Sudan has escalated its military response in the 
area and the Sudanese Minister of Defense visited El Geneina with 
senior SAF officers January 28.  Humanitarian operations outside El 
Geneina have been interrupted as the security situation 
deteriorates, although the situation inside El Geneina is reportedly 
calm.  End summary. 
¶2. (SBU) In response to recent Chadian bombing along the Sudan-Chad 
border (and in some cases in West Darfur) Sudanese Minister of 
Defense General Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad Husayn visited El-Geneina, 
West Darfur, January 28 with a large group of senior SAF officers. 
Husayn announced that Chadian aggression against Sudan was 
unjustified and said Sudan is capable of repelling any aggression on 
its border.  Observers reported that Husayn visited Government of 
Sudan (GOS) local security committees, local Arab community leaders, 
and border patrol units reportedly to revive weakened links between 
local groups and the GOS. 
¶2. (SBU) On January 29 a number of independent sources reported 
hearing helicopters and explosions in the vicinity of the Chad-Sudan 
border near the town of Beida, located 100 kilometers southwest of 
the West Darfur capital of El-Geneina. International NGO Tearfund 
staff reported hearing an explosion at 2:50 AM on January 29, 
followed by additional explosions several hours later on the Chadian 
side of the border.  In the wake of these events, Tearfund and the 
international NGO Concern relocated 27 staff from the border towns 
of Ararah, Beida, Masterie, and Kongo Haraza to El-Geneina as a 
precaution.  UNAMID transported the staff to El-Geneina without 
incident the evening of January 29. 
¶3. (SBU) Tearfund program coordinator told poloff on January 31 that 
62,000 beneficiaries, mostly Internally Displaced Persons (IDP), 
have been affected with reduced nutritional, health promotion, and 
water and sanitation programming.  He said that Tearfund would 
decide within a few days whether to return. International NGO 
Concern country director told poloff on January 30 that programs 
operating north of El-Geneina (ref B) remain suspended with local 
staff providing only essential nutritional services to the 160,000 
affected beneficiaries. The country director said that he expected 
UNAMID to provide an assessment of the security situation this 
weekend but was pessimistic on restarting the program. 
¶4. (SBU) Observers reported a number of Chadian other armed groups 
(COAG) in the Chadian border town of Adre located 20 kilometers west 
of El-Geneina and noted a number of explosions on the morning of 
January 29.  Across the border, El-Geneina commissioner Dr. Al-Watan 
Fadlallah blamed a break away faction of the Justice and equality 
Movement (JEM) for recent local attacks against the neighboring area 
of Sirbe and noted the enhanced security by local and GOS forces. 
Observers confirmed to embassy media reports that Sudanese Armed 
Forces (SAF) recently reinforced El-Geneina and believe that the 
town is safe from direct attack by either Sudanese or Chadian 
rebels. A university professor in El-Geneina told poloff on January 
30 that the town is peaceful and the citizens have no restrictions 
on their movements. 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The humanitarian aid situation in the border areas 
of West Darfur continues to deteriorate.  In mid-January, 
international NGO programs north of El-Geneina (ref B) were largely 
suspended due to cross border incidents. Now, military actions have 
caused humanitarian aid curtailment south of El-Geneina. Post 
expects military actions on both sides to continue if not escalate, 
unless of course the recent GOS-supported Chadian rebel surge toward 
N'djamena is successful (ref D)).
