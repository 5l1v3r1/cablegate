CHECKLIST 
 
REF: STATE 090304 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 16, PolCouns delivered reftel demarche 
to the director of the Brazilian Ministry of External 
Relations (Itamaraty) Office of Transnational Crimes, 
Virginia Toniatti.  Asked if Brazil would complete the UN 
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) self-assessment checklist, 
which Brazil has partially done, Toniatti responded that 
Brazil is fully committed to implementing the UN Convention 
on Transnational Organized Crime.  She added that, if the 
UNODC is interested in the status of Brazil's response to the 
checklist, UNODC should ask the GOB directly.  When told that 
we were asking many countries that have not yet filled out 
the questionnaire about the status of their effort, Toniatti 
responded that "Washington should not get gray hair worrying 
about Brazil." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Toniatti's response to this demarche did 
not differ significantly in tone or substance from others we 
have delivered to her.  With a staff of three to four 
diplomats at any given time, Toniatti's office is responsible 
for all multilateral and bilateral counternarcotics, 
counterterrorism, trafficking in persons, and other 
transnational criminal matters, including the 
US/Brazil/Paraguay/Argentina 3-plus-1 forum.  In addition to 
being hobbled by serious under-staffing issues, she will not 
allow her staff to meet with us unless personally supervised 
by her.  She is among the most sensitive of our Itamaraty 
counterparts to perceived U.S. intrusiveness into Brazilian 
domestic affairs and is generally unreceptive to U.S. 
requests for information or offers of cooperation or 
assistance.  Post continues to enjoy excellent working 
relations with law enforcement agencies at a working level, 
but contacts with Itamaraty diplomats are often characterized 
by the kind of sensitivity displayed here.
