¶1. (U) The Department has reviewed its files and finds that 
it possesses no credible information of gross violations of 
human rights at this time by the members of the Iraqi 
Security Forces listed below.  The Department strongly 
suggests that visa applications for these individuals be 
filed with as much time as possible to allow for additional 
processing procedures that may be required.  Note that if, at 
any time, the Embassy becomes aware of any information 
regarding incidents which could be deemed to be credible 
information of a gross violation of human rights by these 
individuals, the Embassy should so inform the Department.
