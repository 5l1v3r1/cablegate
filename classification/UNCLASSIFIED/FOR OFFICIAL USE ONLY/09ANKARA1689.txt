BROKER SEZAI CIHAN DALMIS - CASE NO. K-0828 
 
REF: SECSTATE 99609 
 
¶1. (SBU) We visited the office of Helper Ltd (reftel) and met 
with company president Sezai Cihan Dalmis on November 24. 
Dalmis told us that the company is not directly involved in 
the import or storage of items on the US Munitions List but 
serves as an intermediary for U.S. and Turkish firms involved 
in defense-related projects. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Dalmis, the company was founded by his 
late father in 1959 and became a limited liability company in 
¶1985.  In addition to Dalmis, who owns 48 percent of the 
company shares, the company only has two other share holders; 
Retired Turkish Navy Captain Emin Gultekin Fisek owns 48 
percent of the shares, and Mr. Ahmet Akkacoglu owns the 
remaining two percent.  The company is registered with the 
Ankara Chamber of Commerce. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Helper's U.S. clients include Lockheed Martin's 
surface ship division and DRS.  The company also has UK and 
Italian firms on its clientele list.  In addition to having 
close contacts with the Turkish Armed Forces and the Ministry 
of National Defense, Helper has also facilitated contracts 
between U.S. and established Turkish defense firms (Havelsan, 
Aselsan, MIKES) on USML items.  Dalmis noted that the company 
also does considerable import/export business for industrial 
machinery, but stated that this aspect of the business does 
not deal with USML items. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Dalmis was cooperative and answered all of our 
questions related to the company and is open to answering any 
additional questions.  Based on the information presented in 
the meeting we believe that the company is a bona fides 
company authorized to engage in defense-related activities.
