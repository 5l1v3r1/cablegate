SUBJECT: RWANDA: 2009 BUSINESS FACILITATION INCENTIVE FUND 
(BFIF) PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 128559 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Kigali submits the following two projects for 
FY09 Business Facilitation Incentive Funds (BFIF). 
 
¶2. (U)  Project 1:  Initiating information linkages and 
collaboration between the Rwandan Small Business Support 
Center and Commercial News/Think Global Incorporated. 
 
-- Justification:  The Rwandan Small Business Support Center 
(SBSC) is supported by the Rwandan Ministry of Commerce and 
by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 
(UNIDO).  It serves as the principal point of contact and 
resource center for Rwandan small and medium enterprises 
seeking international partners and/or new products and 
technology to introduce to Rwanda.  Think Global publishes 
Commercial News USA with an aim to promote American export 
products, and provide information on trade shows and American 
companies interested in expanding international partnerships. 
 Post would like to explore ways to initiate direct contact 
and information linkages between SBSC and the US Commercial 
News/Think Global that would enhance delivery of information 
about U.S. companies and products to potential Rwandan 
partners. 
 
-- Planning milestones:  a) identification and tasking of 
action officers in SBSC and Commercial News USA; b) 
identification of mechanisms to enhance information and 
communication exchange; c) travel by SBSC officers to meet 
with Commercial News USA/Think Global Incorporated in August 
2009 to establish personal contact and explore implementation 
of enhanced information and communication exchange. 
 
-- Performance Metrics:  Expanded communication between 
Rwandan and American companies seeking to work together to 
introduce American products and technologies to Rwanda.  New 
exports of American products and services to Rwanda. 
 
-- Estimated costs:  USD 8-10,000 for transportation, 
lodging, meals and incidentals for Rwandan SBSC team visiting 
U.S. 
 
¶3. (U) Project 2: U.S. Pavilion at the Kigali International 
Trade Show. 
 
-- Justification:  The Kigali International Trade show held 
in August/September showcases Rwandan and international 
businesses engaged in Rwanda or seeking to enter the market. 
In 2008, the show attracted over 100,000 visitors.  A U.S. 
pavilion would provide an opportunity for American companies 
operating in East Africa, or interested in selling to the 
East African Community (EAC) market, to promote their 
products or services and establish new business contacts. A 
U.S. pavilion would additionally demonstrate USG confidence 
in the region and support for East African economic 
integration. 
 
-- Performance metrics:  Showcase American products and 
services to the EAC buyers.  Initiate new business contacts. 
Expand American exports to the region. Demonstrate support 
for EAC economic integration. 
 
-- Estimated costs: USD 5,000 including a 9 square meter 
booth, decorations, internet, staff support and incidentals.
