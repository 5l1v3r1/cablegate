REF: STATE 71931 
 
Panama views positively Reftel concept paper and will support 
the Secretary's initiative to develop universal election 
standards and to create an impartial body to analyze 
electoral practices.  Vice Foreign Minister Ricardo Duran 
told POL Counselor on April 20 that he would support the 
initiative in Santiago.  Duran said he had discussed the 
initiative with Panamanian Electoral Commission President 
Eduardo Valdes, who also liked the idea.  Duran pointed out 
that Panama's electoral commission gained international 
stature when it was asked to participate in Iraq's electoral 
steering committee that organized the recent Iraqi elections. 
 Since 1989 and the ouster of military dictator Manuel 
Noriega, Panama has held three free and fair national 
elections, Duran added.
