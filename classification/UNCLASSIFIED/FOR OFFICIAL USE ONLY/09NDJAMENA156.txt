REF: NDJAMENA 153 AND PREVIOUS. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) CAVEAT: This message presents a composite view of 
the current situation based on a variety of sources, some 
more reliable than others, and our best analysis.  Some 
reports re-circulate, gaining apparent momentum from 
repetition; others are based on rumors or garbled fact.  We 
cite few sources in order to stay within SBU parameters. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) CHAD REBELS STATUS:  As of morning May 7, Chad 
rebels appear to have consolidated into one or two columns 
that are moving between Goz Beida and Am-Timan in a northwest 
direction toward Am-Dam.  At Am-Dam, terrain and road 
conditions directly to the west are difficult; rebel forces 
would likely have to continue north toward Oum Hadjer on the 
main east-west road or move back south toward Am-Timan before 
trying to move westward from there.  The fastest way to reach 
N'Djamena is that main east-west road, which runs through 
Mongo.  There are rumors of internecine fighting among the 
rebels.  Unconfirmed reports claim that Wodji, United 
Resistance Force (UFR) chief of staff, was killed May 6 
fighting.  French sources say that apart from the now-unified 
rebel forces inside Chad, there was a rebel 
logistics/re-supply element still inside Sudan, along with 
some key rebel leaders, including Timan Erdimi.  (We have 
sent by unclassified email a map of the rebel status as of 
this morning to many offices and Embassies.  If you did did 
not receive it and want it, contact by email 
TomaszewiczAJ@state.gov.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) CHAD MILITARY REACTION:  Ground contact between the 
Chadian National Army (ANT) and the rebels seems to have been 
limited, thus far, to one or two May 6 skirmishes.  According 
to French sources, the GOC is currently bombing rebel 
positions just southeast of Am-Dam with two MI-24 HIND attack 
helicopters.  The same sources say that ANT troops are 
deployed in two north-south lines, one line of 5,000 troops 
running north-south of Mongo west of rebel positions, and the 
second of 6,000 troops running north-south between Adre and 
Goz Beida east of rebel positions. Minister of Infrastructure 
Adoum Younousmi is Acting Minister of Defense and is 
directing troop movements in the absence of ailing MOD 
Kamougue.  He evidently seeks to fix rebels between two 
superior ANT ground forces and continue to weaken them by air 
attacks.  The GOC remains confident in its ability to be 
successful. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) MINURCAT:  The UN is continuing normal humanitarian 
operations in the east, save for the evacuation of personnel 
from around Goz Beida.  The UN Directorate of Safety and 
Security passed unconfirmed reports of limited ground clashes 
between ANT and the UFR just outside of Am-Dam, which is 
northwest of Goz Beida. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) FRENCH MILITARY ASSETS:  The French have deployed 
an "Airborne Early Warning and Control" (AKA an "Atlantique") 
airplane to assist the Chadians in gathering information on 
the situation and with airspace management in the east. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) CAPITAL CALM:  N'Djamena remained calm May 7, with 
the usual undercurrent of rumors.  Traffic in and out of 
town, including across the Chad-Cameroon border, continues at 
normal levels. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) EMBASSY EAC MEETING:  EAC met May 5, May 6, and May 
¶7.  The current situation puts us right on the cusp of our 
single trip-wire.  We have an AMCIT warden meeting and an LES 
informational meeting scheduled for late May 7.  We have 
suspended TDY arrivals until further notice.  Details of the 
May 7 EAC meeting will be reported septel. 
 
¶8.  (U) Minimize considered.
