REF: STATE 66915 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  We passed reftel points to the French MFA early on 
June 23, including to the AF and IO/UNP equivalents.  DCM 
subsequently raised the subject with French MFA Political 
Affairs Director (P-equivalent) Gerard Araud.  He stated 
general French agreement with our points and general 
assessment of the dire situation in Zimbabwe.  With respect 
to the UK draft of a PRST under discussion at the UNSC, Araud 
unhesitatingly affirmed French support in principle for such 
a move but indicated the GOF would want to consider the text 
before deciding what it would do.  As regards French public 
statements about the situation, he encouraged us to check the 
Internet for FM Kouchner's public statements on the subject, 
which are summarized below, but not yet available on the 
French MFA website at www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Both French President Sarkozy and FM Kouchner, 
together in Israel for a state visit, blasted the government 
of Zimbabwe for its treatment of that country's political 
opposition.  Sarkozy, in a statement issued June 22 by the 
French presidency, accused the GOZ of having "deliberately 
chosen the path of violence" to "gag" its people and prevent 
Zimbabweans from expressing themselves at the ballot box.  He 
further condemned the "campaign of violent acts and serious 
atrocities perpetrated by the regime of President Mugabe 
against Mr. Tsvangirai, opposition supporters, and the 
Zimbabwean people."  Sarkozy said these acts constitute a 
"flagrant violation" of democracy and the rules set forth 
under the AU and SADC charters.  "France will never accept 
any formulation that does not strictly conform to the will of 
Zimbabwe's people (,who are) not able to express themselves 
by the ballot box and in the framework of a free, just, open, 
and transparent vote," the communique continued.  "What will 
take place Friday will not be responsive to this expectation." 
 
¶3.  (U)  In an interview June 22, Kouchner, was typically 
much more blunt in his characterization of the situation in 
Zimbabwe and of President Mugabe:  "Whoever believes he is 
ordained by God and that God should keep him in his position 
is nothing but a swindler and an assassin, and that must be 
said with force.  (Tsvangirai) threw in the towel because 
someone murdered a certain number of his supporters and above 
all officials of his party.  It is, therefore, not a question 
for France to accept this false election, that would finish 
up with one sole candidate. ...It is truly the greatest 
denial of democracy that Africa has ever know. 
 
¶4.  (U)  The French MFA, on June 23, issued a more measured 
statement through its spokesperson, who was asked at the 
daily press briefing whether Mugabe had lost his legitimacy 
following the decision by Tsvangirai to withdraw from the 
presidential election.  Following is the Embassy's informal 
translation of the text of the statement: 
 
Begin text: 
 
France respects the decision of Mr. Morgan Tsvangirai not to 
stand for election in the second round of the Zimbabwean 
presidential election.  We hold the Zimbabwean authorities 
responsible for this withdrawal, due to a climate of 
deliberate violence, and deplore, as the Slovene presidency 
of the European Union did yesterday, the grave atrocities 
perpetrated by the regime of President Mugabe against Mr. 
Tsvangirai and his supporters. 
 
In the absence of Mr. Tsvangirai, the vote scheduled for June 
27 does not meet the expectations of the international 
community for a free, just, open, and transparent election. 
 
As the Slovene presidency of the European Union Council said, 
we wish to work together with the AU and SADC. 
 
Concerning France, the President of the Republic indicated 
that we must be ready to "take, with our EU partners, all 
measures necessary against those responsible for what has 
become an electoral masquerade.
