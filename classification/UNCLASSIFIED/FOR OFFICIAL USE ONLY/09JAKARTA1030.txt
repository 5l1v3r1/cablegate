¶1. (SBU) The Anti-Corruption Court sentenced Aulia Pohan -- 
President Yudhoyono's son's father-in-law -- to 4 1/2 years on 
corruption charges on June 17.  The court also sentenced three 
additional central bank deputy governors, bringing the total to nine 
public officials convicted in this central bank bribery scandal. 
President Yudhoyono has maintained his impartiality throughout his 
in-law's case, boosting his anti-corruption credentials.  The 
Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) is evaluating evidence for 
further prosecutions in this scandal, which could involve two 
current government ministers. 
 
NINE CONVICTIONS IN CENTRAL BANK BRIBERY SCANDAL 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Anti-Corruption Court sentenced former central bank 
deputy governor Aulia Pohan to 4 1/2 years in jail, six more months 
than the prosecution's request.  The three other deputy governors 
received either 4 or 4 1/2 year sentences.  One judge on the 
five-person panel offered a dissenting opinion on technical grounds, 
but the sentence will likely withstand Pohan's appeal.  Pohan and 
the three other deputy governors were convicted of embezzling state 
funds and authorizing bribes to members of Parliament to pass 
legislation.  In 2008, the Anti-Corruption Court sentenced former 
central bank governor Burhanuddin Abdullah to 5 1/2 years for his 
role in the bribery scandal, in addition to two other central bank 
directors.  In January 2009, the Anti-Corruption Court sentenced two 
former members of Parliament to three and five year sentences for 
taking the bribes. 
 
PRESIDENT REINFORCES ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMITMENT 
 
¶3. (SBU) President Yudhoyono has publicly maintained from the outset 
that he would not interfere in his in-law's corruption case, which 
has earned him considerable praise.  This case demonstrates 
President Yudhoyono's commitment to combating corruption and 
reinforces campaign messages that highlight his clean record.  Press 
accounts of the June 17 conviction -- including a full front page 
spread in Indonesian language daily Koran Tempo -- focused praise 
more on the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), and pointed to 
more possible arrests.  The Pohan case proceeded at a normal pace 
since the November 2008 arrest and contacts did not think that this 
sentencing three weeks before the presidential elections was 
politically motivated.  The 4 1/2 year sentence is in line with 
average Anti-Corruption Court sentences. 
 
MORE HIGH-LEVEL FIGURES TO FALL IN THIS SCANDAL? 
 
¶4. (SBU) The KPK is evaluating evidence for further cases related to 
this central bank bribery case, according to a contact close to KPK 
leadership.  The KPK has gathered additional evidence and now has 
more time and capacity to pursue new suspects after finishing the 
Pohan case.  Two current government ministers - M.S. Kaban 
(Forestry) and Paskah Suzetta (Development Planning) - served in 
Parliament on the commission that received bribes from the central 
bank in 2003.  A convicted member of Parliament in this case has 
accused the two current ministers of receiving bribes, but they have 
yet to be named suspects in the case.  Current Parliament Budget 
Commission Chairman Emir Moeis has also been questioned in the case, 
but not named a suspect. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Aulia Pohan has also called for the arrest of Supreme Audit 
Board chairman Anwar Nasution, who was a central bank deputy 
governor at the time of the embezzlement and bribery.  Nasution 
reported this case to the KPK in November 2006 and the KPK has 
questioned him further over the past year.  However, Nasution 
appears to be safe from prosecution at this point, according to 
civil society contacts.
