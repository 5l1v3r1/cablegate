REF: 04 MANAGUA 0169 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Post requests that nonimmigrant visa eligibility 
be restored for retired General Rodrigo Salomon Gonzalez Garcia. 
Post has confirmed that Gonzalez resolved his property claim dispute 
with U.S. citizen Vilma Aurora Amort on May 31, 2005.  Based on this 
evidence, Post requests that the Department determine whether 
Section 2225 of the 1998 Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring 
Act still applies to Mr. Gonzalez Garcia.  Please see action request 
in Paragraph 4.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) This is the first in a series of cables to update resolved 
property disputes between U.S. citizens and individuals previously 
deemed ineligible for a nonimmigrant visa under Section 2225 of the 
1998 Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On May 31, 2005, Mrs. Vilma Aurora Amort settled her 
property claim dispute with Gonzalez Garcia by accepting 
indemnification bonds issued by the Government of Nicaragua (GON) 
worth an estimated $731,424.  On August 5, 2005, the Embassy 
received a copy of the settlement document from the GON.  On March 
10, 2008, Econoff spoke to Mrs. Amort who confirmed that her claim 
had been settled.  Mrs. Amort lives in Nicaragua may be contacted 
information at (505) 772-3736. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action Request: Post finds sufficient evidence that the 
property dispute between Vilma Aurora Amort and Rodrigo Salomon 
Gonzalez Garcia has been resolved.  Thus, we request the Department 
consider removing his visa ineligibility under Section 2225.
