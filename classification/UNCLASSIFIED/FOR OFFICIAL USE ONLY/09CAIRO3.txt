----------- 
Rafah Quiet 
----------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) As of 1500 hrs. local on January 2, we have received 
no reports of demonstrations, attacks, or other problems at 
the Rafah border crossing into Gaza; however, local USG staff 
report clashes on January 2 between police and demonstrators 
in Al-Arish in North Sinai, about 20 miles from the Gaza 
border, injuring several demonstrators.  We continue to 
monitor this situation closely. 
 
------------------------------ 
Demonstrations in Cairo, Delta 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Local USG staff report that police on January 2 
attacked demonstrators outside the Al Gamya Shariya mosque in 
downtown Cairo, injuring an Al-Masry Al-Youm reporter who was 
transferred to a hospital.  Local staff also report 
demonstrations in Ismailia and Suez. 
 
------------------------ 
Israelis Visit Synagogue 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to USG staff in Alexandria, about 300 
Israelis have visited the Nebi Daniel synagogue there in 
advance of the upcoming annual celebration at the tomb of Abu 
Hizara in the Delta.  The GoE has been generally supportive 
of this annual pilgrimage despite Islamist and local 
opposition.

Aboul Gheit Blasts Syrians, Israelis, Iranians, and Hamas 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Local press reports that Foreign Minister Aboul 
Gheit told local editors on January 1 that Syria had refused 
an Egyptian request that Hamas allow the return of the 
Palestinian Authority to oversee the re-opening of the Rafah 
border crossing.  Aboul Gheit that Israel has attempted since 
1981 to separate Gaza from the West Bank.  He said the 
current Israeli attack on Gaza is the third of its kind, and 
Egypt will not allow such attacks to continue.  He added that 
Hamas tried to obtain Egyptian recognition because it knows 
that Egyptian recognition will lead to international 
recognition, which in the end only serves Israeli interests. 
Aboul Gheit said that Egypt has the ability and power to work 
alone, even if it has to face both the Israeli and Iranian 
"projects" in the Middle East.  He said that Israel has 
"offered" Gaza to Egypt, while Jordan "takes" the West Bank, 
but Egypt refuses such talk.  He added that Hamas' strategy 
was to force Egypt to recognize Hamas by permanently opening 
the Rafah crossing, but this is something that Egypt cannot 
do, since doing so would effectively end the Palestinian 
Authority in the West Bank, and also achieve the Israeli goal 
of separating Gaza from the West Bank.
