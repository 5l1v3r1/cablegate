¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U) Deputy Pol/C discussed reftel points with Roy 
Soemirat, Director of the Nuclear Weapons Section of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) Directorate for 
International Security and Disarmament.  Soemirat said that, 
like the United States, Indonesia places high importance on 
the Article XIV Conference as a means of moving multilateral 
nonproliferation cooperation forward.   Dep Pol/C conveyed 
reftel expression of thanks for Indonesia's public 
declaration of its intention to ratify the Comprehensive Test 
Ban Treaty following U.S. ratification.  In response, 
Soemirat said Indonesia agrees that such public statements 
are useful to create momentum for ratification by other Annex 
2 countries that have yet to ratify. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Soemirat said the GOI welcomes the request for 
bilateral talks in New York on the margins of the Article XIV 
Conference at the Under Secretary level, but that it can not 
yet confirm who will participate.  The Jakarta delegation to 
the conference is scheduled to be led by Ambassador Rezlan 
Ishar Jenie,  DEPLU Director General for Multilateral 
affairs.  Ambassador Jenie is currently in Vienna for the 
IAEA General Conference and may travel to New York directly 
from there.  Soemirat suggested Indonesia's UN Mission would 
be able to coordinate the bilateral meeting request.
