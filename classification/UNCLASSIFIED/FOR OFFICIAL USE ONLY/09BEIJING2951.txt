AF-PAK CONSULTATIONS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  China was willing to enhance its 
cooperation with the United States to combat illicit 
financing and terrorism, MFA Department of Asian Affairs 
Deputy Director General Sun Weidong told Treasury DAS Daniel 
Glaser October 19.  Sun said the Chinese government was still 
going through internal deliberations regarding SRAP 
Holbrooke's proposal to send a working-level delegation to 
Washington for Af-Pak consultations. DAS Glaser outlined the 
work of the Illicit Financing Task Force (IFTF) on 
Afghanistan and Pakistan and urged China to send a delegation 
to Washington for Af-Pak consultations.  End Summary. 
 
China Willing to Enhance CT and AML Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. (SBU) DAS Glaser underscored the importance of combating 
illicit financing in Afghanistan and Pakistan and outlined 
the work of the five sub-groups of the Treasury-led, 
interagency Illicit Financing Task Force (IFTF) on 
Afghanistan and Pakistan.  DDG Sun responded that China 
placed great importance to the issues of anti-money 
laundering and counterterrorism, citing China's "active" 
support for these issues in the UN and regional 
organizations.  Sun said China was willing to enhance 
cooperation with the United States on anti-money laundering 
and counterterrorism.  Noting the good relationship between 
the U.S. Treasury Department and the People's Bank of China 
(PBoC), Sun suggested Treasury maintain close contact with 
PBoC on these issues. (COMMENT: DAS Glaser brought up 
enhanced cooperation on Af-Pak illicit finance issues with 
PBOC Anti-Money Laundering Bureau Director General Tang Xu at 
their October 20 meeting, but DG Tang did not show great 
interest in working with the U.S. Treasury in the area and 
referred Treasury to Chinese law enforcement agencies.) 
 
China Still Studying Proposal for Af-Pak Consultations 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) DAS Glaser urged China to send a delegation to 
Washington for working-level consultations on Af-Pak.  Sun 
said China placed great importance to Ambassador Holbrooke's 
proposals for increased U.S.-China cooperation on Af-Pak, 
including the proposal for working-level consultations.  The 
Chinese government was still going through internal 
deliberations regarding Ambassador Holbrooke's proposal and 
would make a decision after "carefully studying" the 
proposal.  U.S.-China coordination served our common 
interests in stability and prosperity in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan, Sun said.
