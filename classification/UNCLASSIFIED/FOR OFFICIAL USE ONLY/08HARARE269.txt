SUBJECT: A CREDIBLE PROCESS? ELECTION OBSERVERS WEIGH IN 
 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: In the days following Zimbabwe,s national 
election, two independent observation missions -- SADC and 
the Pan African Parliament (PAP) -- released preliminary 
evaluations of the election. Despite noting serious 
irregularities in the pre-electoral environment, both 
missions deemed the election day processes credible and in 
accordance with standards set by regional bodies. In light of 
the projection of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network 
(ZESN) that Morgan Tsvangirai would come first in the 
presidential race, along with reports by civil society and 
the MDC of pre-election rigging and post-election delays, 
SADC's findings were widely criticized by opposition and 
civil society stakeholders. PAP,s statement, which noted 
concerns over the delay in releasing the final results, was 
better received.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 30, one day after voting and well ahead of 
the release of any results, the Southern African Development 
Community's (SADC) observer mission, comprised of 163 
representatives from 11 of the 13 member states and chaired 
by Angolan Minister of Youth and Sports Jose Marcos Barrica, 
issued its preliminary statement on the election at a press 
conference in Harare. The chairman stated that despite 
problems in the pre-election process, the elections "have 
been a peaceful and credible expression of the will of the 
Zimbabwean people," in accordance with SADC guidelines for 
democratic elections. SADC's sentiments drew immediate ire 
from both civil society organizations and the opposition. MDC 
Secretary General Tendai Biti, who has repeatedly stated the 
 
SIPDIS 
election was not free and fair, questioned how SADC could 
lend credibility to an election that had yet to conclude. 
Other local observers questioned South Africa's deferment of 
mission leadership to the Angolan chairman, particularly in 
light of Angola's own electoral record. (NOTE: SADC-PF, the 
Parliamentary Forum specializing in election observation, 
which has a reputation for neutrality, was barred from 
participating in the election by President Mugabe. END NOTE.) 
Notably, two representatives who are also members of South 
Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance, refused to sign the 
statement. 
 
¶3. (U) On March 31, the PAP election observation mission held 
a press conference to release its interim statement. The PAP 
mission was comprised of 19 members of parliament (from both 
opposition and ruling parties) from five regions in Africa. 
PAP began by raising concerns about the pre-electoral 
environment, including unprofessional statements by security 
forces; excess printing of ballots; inadequate preparation of 
voters for new changes to the electoral process; and possible 
voter roll fraud, gerrymandering, and partisan dispersal of 
food. Despite these concerns, PAP concluded that voting on 
election day generally met basic standards for free and fair 
elections in accordance with the Organization of African 
Unity/African Union Declaration on the Principles Governing 
Democratic Elections in Africa. PAP based its conclusion 
largely on the preponderance of polling stations, the 
professional behavior of the majority of police officers 
present in and around stations, observer access, and the 
posting of initial results outside polling stations in 
accordance with new changes to the Electoral Act. 
 
¶4. (U) However, PAP also emphasized that the post-election 
phase, which was part of the electoral process, remained a 
serious concern as the delay in announcing final results 
continued. PAP noted it had raised these issues with the 
chairman of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), who 
responded that the ZEC had had trouble collecting results 
from remote areas. PAP stated it would continue to closely 
monitor the process and would make a final statement as soon

as possible. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: SADC's whitewash of the electoral process, 
while disappointing, was to be expected.  PAP's analysis was 
more objective; PAP left open the possibility of further 
criticism should ZANU-PF seriously manipulate the results. 
END COMMENT.
