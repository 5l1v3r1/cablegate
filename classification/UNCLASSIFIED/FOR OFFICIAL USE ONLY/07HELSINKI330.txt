REF: SECSTATE 57912 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on the Convention 
on Intentional Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and 
Flora (CITES) to Mr. Esko Jaakkola, Finland,s CITES 
representative in the Ministry of the Environment.  Jaakkola 
said the EU has closely coordinated its response on the 
various proposals and that it would likely speak and vote as 
a block. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Jaakkola said the EU is not in favor of the U.S. 
proposal to remove bobcats (Lynx rufus) from the Appendix II 
of CITES due to ongoing positive identification concerns. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The EU member states are supportive of the U.S. 
proposal to include all species of the sawfish family 
(Pristidae) in Appendix I of CITES, as well as inclusion of 
pink and red corals (Corallium) provided there is a provision 
to allow for modest tourist trade. 
 
¶4. (SBU) As an EU member state, Finland is of course 
supportive of Germany,s two marine proposals dealing with 
the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and porbeagle (Lamna 
nasus).  However, Jaakkola stated the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) does not support the Germany proposals, 
likely leading to a real challenge in others accepting the 
proposals.
