ANTI-ISRAEL BODIES 
 
REF: STATE 178061 
 
(SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points on opposing UNGA 
anti-Israel bodies to MFA Head of Sector for Multilateral 
Relations Goran Stevcevski on October 25.  Stevcevski said 
the GOM will consider the U.S. position, but made it clear 
that Macedonia likely would follow the joint EU position on 
the matter. (NOTE: The GOM generally supports USG positions 
at the UNGA.  As an EU candidate country, however, Macedonia 
usually feels "bound" to follow the joint EU position, if it 
exists, on an UNGA resolution, even if the USG opposes it. 
If there is no EU consensus, Macedonia generally will abstain 
or support the USG position. END NOTE.)
