¶1.  (SBU) PolOff presented reftel points and delivered copies 
of three non-papers to Augusto Saa, Director of Human Rights 
and Social and Environmental issues at the MFA, on October 
12, emphasizing the USG view that the Chair's draft 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (DRIP) is 
fundamentally flawed.  Saa said that the GOE continues to 
support the draft Declaration, but has advised its UN mission 
not to push any sensitive issues and would share USG concerns 
regarding the declaration with them.  He agreed that more 
discussion of the declaration would be necessary before a 
final vote, and said Ecuador would consult with others who 
are in favor while remaining open to listening to further 
arguments from those who oppose it.  However, he emphasized 
it would be difficult for Ecuador to change its position 
citing political realities, the country's current electoral 
climate and the interest with which indigenous groups were 
following the declaration's progress.
