Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 
 
1.(U) Since the first H1N1 case was announced on June 2, when a 12 
year old Egyptian-American girl arrived in country from the United 
States via the Netherlands, the Ministry of Health (MOH)has 
confirmed a total of 61 cases as of June 29. No H1N1 fatalities have 
occurred. 
 
¶2. (U) Egyptian authorities continue to actively search for new H1N1 
cases and have detected all infected individuals through thermal 
scans or contact cards filled out by incoming passengers at Egyptian 
airports. All positive cases are quarantined and referred to 
hospitals with dedicated H1N1 wards for treatment with the drug 
oseltamivir.  Follow-up testing is performed on cases until there no 
evidence of viral shedding by laboratory tests. 
 
¶3. (U) H1N1 accounts continue to dominate Egyptian media which run 
daily tallies of the total number of cases.  Many portray newly 
reported cases - regardless of nationality - as having contracted 
the virus outside the country.  One widely read and independent 
newspaper, Al Masry Al Youm (Today's Egypt), epitomizes this 
approach and has described the H1N1 cases as "all coming from 
abroad, especially from the United States." 
 
4 (U) With Ramadan less than two months away, MOH officials continue 
to discourage Muslim pilgrims from traveling to Saudi Arabia because 
of the dangers posed by H1N1. The MOH then announced on June 25 that 
a 28 year old Egyptian man was infected with the virus; he acquired 
H1N1 during Umra (minor pilgrimage that can be undertaken at any 
time of the year) in Saudi Arabia. However despite MOH warnings, 
Grand Mufti Sheikh Ali Gomaa, Egypt's top cleric, stated he would 
not issue a decree barring Egyptians from traveling to Mecca.  MOH 
later announced that all returning pilgrims would be quarantined. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In a conversation with Dr. Samir Abu-Zid, an epidemiologist 
and senior MOH official involved in disease surveillance issues, the 
Ministry is "controlling the virus as much as possible but 
transmission is inevitable." This comment reflects official views on 
H1N1.  The Minister of Health Hatem el-Gabali stated two days ago it 
is "illogical to eliminate the disease" but Egypt can only hope to 
contain it. Dr. Abu-Zid also noted that while new cases contain both 
Egyptian and foreign visitors, many people acquired the virus 
outside the country before arriving in Egypt.  Dr. Abu-Zid expressed 
confidence that at this point, hospitals possess the necessary 
capacity to handle H1N1 patients.
