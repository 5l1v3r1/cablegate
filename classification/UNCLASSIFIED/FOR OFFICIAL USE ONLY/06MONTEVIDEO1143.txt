¶1. (U) Summary:  November 29, President Vazquez ordered the 
Uruguayan military to create a protective ring around the 
controversial Botnia paper mill in order to prevent possible acts of 
sabotage.  The GOU also filed a complaint against Argentina with the 
International Court of Justice demanding an end to the blockade of 
bridges between Uruguay and Argentina by Argentina protesters.  The 
Argentine ambassador to Uruguay has asked for details of the force 
to be deployed, and Uruguayans wonder if Argentina or Argentine 
protesters might take the presence of troops as a provocation.  End 
Summary. 
 
MILITARY TO THE PAPER MILLS 
--------------------------- 
¶2. (U) November 29, President Vazquez ordered the Uruguayan military 
to create a protective ring around the controversial Botnia paper 
mill in order to prevent possible acts of sabotage. The army will 
patrol the land surrounding the plant near Fray Bentos, and the 
Coast Guard will monitor the river near the plant.  Argentine 
protesters, who blocked major bridges into Uruguay last summer and 
resumed the blockade this November, have long reviled the plant, and 
the GOU fears that the protesters may attempt sabotage.  Press 
reports indicate that earlier this year thousands of eucalyptus 
seedlings were stolen from a Botnia facility by protesters who left 
a note justifying their actions.  The military is still formulating 
its plans to execute the President's order.  Botnia currently 
subsidizes the salaries of 50 Uruguayan policemen who guarded the 
facility and will continue to patrol the Botnia property. 
 
URUGUAY FILES IN ICJ 
-------------------- 
¶3. (U) On November 28, Uruguay filed a complaint against Argentina 
in the International Court of Justice (ICJ).  The formal document 
claims that the GOA has done nothing to stop the blockade of an 
international border by Argentine protesters.  It asks that 
Argentina take ""every reasonable and appropriate measure at its 
disposal to prevent the interruption of transit between Uruguay and 
Argentina.""  Local politicians seem resigned to the fact that the 
ICJ process will be incredibly long, and they continue to seek 
alternative measures. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶4. (SBU) Just as Vazquez and opposition leader Larranaga met 
recently in a show of solidarity with Botnia, we note the potential 
for Argentina to do the same with Gualeguaychu's protesters.  The 
Argentine Ambassador to Uruguay immediately asked for details of the 
planned military force which will be located immediately across the 
river from Argentina.  The military force could possibly antagonize 
the protesters or the Argentine nation and lead to a serious 
escalation of the dispute.
