SUBJECT: DEMARCHE:  TURNING OFF THE CEIRPP UN-SPONSORED 
ISRAEL-PALESTINE EVENT IN ROME 3/22-23/07 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request.  Department requests USUN 
urge UN Undersecretary General Gambari and/or Secretary 
General Ban to persuade the Committee on the Exercise of the 
Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP) to 
cancel its event on Israel-Palestine scheduled for March 
22-23 in Rome.  Department also requests Embassy Rome urge 
the Government of Italy at the highest level possible to 
remove their support for this event.  Department requests 
that this demarche be delivered no later than February 2. 
Posts should draw freely from background information in paras 
3-4 below when making these points.  End action request. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Objectives:  Department instructs USUN and Embassy 
Rome to pursue the following objectives: 
 
--  Note that, while we appreciate the intentions of the 
Government of Italy to assist the Lebanese and Palestinian 
people, the U.S. is opposed to this initiative, which is 
particularly unhelpful at this time when there are promising 
efforts to renew discussions on the Middle East, including 
the February 2 Quartet meeting in Washington and a later 
planned trilateral meeting with Secretary Rice, PM Olmert and 
PA President Abbas. 
 
--  Emphasize that such an event, which will inevitably 
become a forum for one-sided criticism of Israel, will poison 
the international environment and make it harder for both 
sides to move forward towards negotiations. 
 
--  Emphasize that the Italian proposal to reorient the event 
to address "alliance of civilization" issues is not likely to 
be successful.  Note that there is already a UN organization, 
the Alliance of Civilizations, to address the issue. 
Additionally, UNESCO has its own "Dialogue of Civilizations" 
along the same lines.  We should not duplicate the activities 
of these organizations in the CEIRPP. 
 
--  (For Rome)  Note that we do not support the Committee on 
the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian 
People (CEIRPP), which perpetuates the UN,s unhelpful bias 
on the Israel-Palestinian conflict and makes no contribution 
to helping the parties come together to resolve their 
differences. 
 
--  (For Rome)  Note also that, particularly in light of 
Italy,s command of UNIFIL, Italy should take special care to 
maintain a balanced position on Middle East questions. 
Stress that by supporting this event, Italy will be aligning 
itself in the public eye to the discredited CEIRPP. 
 
--  (For USUN)  Express U.S. concerns about the impact of 
this event on the UN's relationship with the U.S., 
specifically that one of the first events under the new UN 
leadership will be seen by the U.S. Congress and public as 
yet another example of UN-sponsored Israel bashing. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Background:  At the request of the Committee on 
the Exercise of the Inalienable Right of the Palestinian 
People (CEIRPP) and the Palestinian PermRep in New York, 
Italy has agreed to host an ill-considered event on 
Israel-Palestine on March 22-23 in Rome.  The Italians 
support this event as part of their post-Lebanon-conflict 
commitment to refocus international attention on the 
Palestinian question.  On January 20, the Italian Embassy in 
Washington, DC, delivered an aide memoire announcing their 
intention to "formulate suggestions for (the CEIRPP) event's 
success."  The note continues that Italy would like the 
discussion to remain focused on areas of common ground rather 
than the "condemnatory and argumentative tones (Israel 
bashing) that characterize debates on the Israel-Palestine 
dispute at the UNGA." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Background cont.:  Despite the conciliatory and 
balanced approach planned by the Italians, the U.S. has a 
number of concerns about this event: 
 
--  Despite the best intentions of the Government of Italy, 
this event is likely to devolve into a divisive, 
argumentative, and condemnatory platform, which will do 
nothing to bring the parties together.  While we recognize 
Italy's desire, due in part to its lead role in UNIFIL, to 
assist the Lebanese and Palestinian people, this event will 
not provide any tangible benefits to either group and will 
 
STATE 00011796  002 OF 002 
 
 
only perpetuate the common view that the UN can not address 
the issue with balance. 
 
--  The U.S. finds this initiative unhelpful to the 
Secretary's recent efforts to renew discussions on the Middle 
 
SIPDIS 
East Peace Process (including pursing a two-state solution), 
beginning with the Quartet meeting on February 2. 
 
--  The timing is inopportune for the new leadership at the 
UN.  At a time with the new Secretary General and his team 
should be making particular efforts to enhance the UN's 
relationship with the U.S., this event would be seen in 
Congress and by the American people as another example of 
UN-sponsored Israel bashing. 
 
--  The U.S. does not support and is actively trying to 
terminate the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable 
Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP), which perpetuates 
the UN,s unhelpful bias on the Israel-Palestinian conflict 
and makes no contribution to helping the parties come 
together to resolve their differences. 
 
--  This event will cover similar ground to other UN 
organizations - the Alliance of Civilizations and UNESCO's 
"Dialogue of Civilizations." 
 
¶5. (U)  Point of contact:  Responses and follow-up inquiries 
should be slugged for Raymond Hotz, IO/UNP.  Department 
appreciates Posts' assistance.
