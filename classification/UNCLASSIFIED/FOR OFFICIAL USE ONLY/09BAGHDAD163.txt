SUBJECT: UNIDO'S PRESENCE IN IRAQ - REQUEST FOR DEMARCHE TO 
DIRECTOR GENERAL YUMKELLA 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  This is an action request.  Please see paras 3-4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In recent conversations with Ambassador Crocker, 
UNAMI SRSG Staffan de Mistura relayed that UNIDO's 
Representative on Iraq, currently based in Vienna, is 
interested in deploying to Baghdad.  A permanent presence 
would enhance UNIDO's effectiveness and also send a powerful 
signal of confidence in Iraq's improving security and 
political environment.  It would also complement other steps 
UNAMI has undertaken to expand and improve the UN's role in 
Iraq. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In order to reinforce de Mistura's own messages to 
UNIDO on this issue, we and USUN request that the Department 
instruct US Mission Vienna to demarche UNIDO DG Yumkella to 
send a representative to Iraq.  Proposed demarche points 
follow below. 
 
¶4.  (U) Begin text of proposed demarche: 
 
-- In recent conversations with Ambassador Crocker, SRSG 
Staffan de Mistura has conveyed that UNIDO's Representative 
on Iraq, currently based in Vienna, is interested in 
deploying to Baghdad. 
 
-- We would warmly welcome, and strongly encourage, UNIDO's 
presence and skills to help shape this critical phase of 
Iraq's economic development. 
 
-- A permanent presence would enhance UNIDO's effectiveness 
and also send a powerful signal of confidence in Iraq's 
improving security and political environment. 
 
SECURITY IMPROVING 
 
-- Over the past two years, conditions in Iraq have improved 
dramatically. 
 
-- Security continues on a positive trend with many key 
violence indicators at levels not seen since 2004. 
 
-- Attacks have decreased from an average of 180 per day, to 
10 per day -- a 95 percent reduction from a year ago.  The 
number of civilian deaths from violence in 2008 fell 
approximately 75 percent compared to 2007. 
 
-- Many factors have contributed to this including 
increasingly capable Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), aided by 
the Sons of Iraq (SoI), Coalition forces' continuing support 
for the ISF, the demonstrated will of the GOI to counter 
extremists, and the rejection of terrorists by the Iraqi 
people. 
 
-- ISF and Coalition forces continue to pursue remaining 
extremists and have made considerable gains in securing 
population centers, while extending security toward Iraq's 
borders. 
 
-- The ISF is eliminating many terrorist safe havens and 
passage points and significantly slowing the inflow of 
foreign fighters and weapons into Iraq. 
 
-- The number of ISF battalions in the lead or capable of 
conducting counterinsurgency operations is steadily 
increasing, as recent operations have demonstrated. 
 
-- The continuous presence and increased effectiveness of the 
ISF has also helped ease the distrust between different 
ethnic and sectarian populations and has facilitated the 
return of some displaced persons. 
 
-- Iraqi leaders continue to make incremental but important 
progress.  Iraqi lawmakers demonstrated their ability to 
reach across sectarian lines and compromise on key issues. 
 
-- The passage of the Provincial Elections Law, in September, 
demonstrated the growing commitment to democracy.  Provincial 
elections will take place January 
¶31. 
 
UNAMI EXPANDING 
 
-- The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) is 
a critical part of the international community's support for 
Iraq.  It has unique credibility among Iraqis. 
 
-- As conditions have improved, UNAMI -- in close cooperation 
with the Government of Iraq -- has expanded its role. 
 
-- UNAMI is deeply engaged in a number of political and 
 
BAGHDAD 00000163  002 OF 002 
 
 
diplomatic activities in line with its broadened mandate 
under UNSCR 1770, which now includes national dialogue, 
political reconciliation, resolving disputed boundaries, 
promoting regional dialogue, facilitating demobilization, 
disarmament and reintegration, as well as protecting IDPs and 
refugees, facilitating essential services, and spearheading 
assistance for the upcoming provincial elections. 
 
-- As you know, SRSG de Mistura supports seeing more UN 
agencies increase their presence in Iraq, in line with GOI 
expectations.  He also looks forward to physically expanding 
the UN Mission in the near term to increase capacity and 
accommodation. 
 
-- Last year, the UN expanded its footprint by adding staff 
to PRTs in Najaf, Ramadi, Kirkuk and Mosul and two UNDP 
representatives have been posted in Basrah. 
 
UNIDO SHOULD BE HERE 
 
-- The coming year will offer opportunities we have not had 
before. 
 
-- With each passing month, more economic development issues 
are coming to the fore. 
 
-- To best take advantage of this, Iraq needs help developing 
strategies to address industrial sector reform and 
development.  Indeed, these issues will form a core element 
of the major new Private Sector Development project that the 
UN and the Iraqi government are now finalizing, with strong 
support from the U.S. and other donors. 
 
-- Given UNIDO's unique expertise, having a UNIDO 
representative on the ground should be part of the 
international community's efforts to build a stable, 
peaceful, democratic and prosperous Iraq. 
 
-- We very much hope you will consider your Representative's 
proposed relocation to Baghdad favorably.
