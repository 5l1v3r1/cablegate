¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On May 15, 2006, Hellenic authorities 
arrested four alleged leaders of the international 
Stathopoulos drug trafficking organization.  Greek police 
also seized approximately 100,000 MDMA (commonly known as 
ecstasy) tablets, roughly 1,040,000 euros (USD 1,333,000) in 
drug-related proceeds, and two vehicles. The arrests are 
attributed to a successful Athens DEA Country Officer 
undercover infiltration operation that began in March 2005 
and showcase strong U.S.-Greek cooperation in combating drug 
trafficking, an MPP goal.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Andreas Stathopoulos drug trafficking 
organization (DTO) is responsible for distributing hundreds 
of kilograms of cocaine, multi-million tablet quantities of 
MDMA/ecstasy and multi-ton quantities of ephedrine throughout 
Europe and Australia.  Assisting Greek officials, Athens DEA 
Country Officer (CO) recruited and developed a confid ential 
source with intimate knowledge of the Andreas Stathopoulos 
DTO in March 2005, and by July 2005 Athens authorities were 
able to infiltrate the organization. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Undercover agents met with Stathopoulos several 
times over the next year throughout Greece to negotiate terms 
for Stathopoulos to supply undercover agents with 
multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine and multi-thousand 
MDMA/ecstasy tablets in exchange for multi-ton quantities of 
ephedrine.  Final agreement involved an exchange of 400,000 
MDMA/ecstasy tablets for one ton of ephedrine, with 
Stathopoulos requesting the undercover agents sell an 
additional 100,000 MDMA/ecstasy tablets in the U.S. on 
Stathopoulos' behalf. It was agreed that future transactions 
would be contingent upon the success of this exchange 
(reftel).  Hellenic Authorities arrested Stathopoulos, along 
with three other leaders of the DTO, Konstantinos Skouras, 
Dimitris Samsonidis, and Australian national Leigh William 
Dalton.  The arrests were made without incident during the 
"exchange" meeting in Agia Marina, Greece on May 15, 2006. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A parallel financial investigation focusing on the 
Stathopoulos DTO's drug-related assets identified two bank 
accounts held by Skouras and Samsonidis, with a combined 
total of 920,000 euro (USD 1,180,000). These accounts were 
frozen and are subject to seizure pending the outcome of the 
trial.  A search or Skouras' and Samsonidis' residence led to 
the seizure of a loaded automatic weapon and two cars. 
Dalton's residence contained approximately 920,000 euro (USD 
1,180,000) in bank drafts (the DTO's financial instrument for 
laundering drug-related proceeds). From May 2004-May 2005, 
the Stathopoulos DTO purchased in excess of 282 bank drafts 
totaling 1,300,000 euros (approximately USD 1,666,000). 
Warrants were obtained prior to all searches and Hellenic 
authorities will seize accounts pursuant to Hellenic Laws 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: Combating international trafficking in 
narcotics by effectively identifying, disrupting, and 
eliminating drug smuggling is an MPP performance objective. 
This challenging year-long investigation by Greek law 
enforcement agencies clearly contributed to this MPP 
performance objective.  Moreover, the case involved active 
collaboration and information sharing between Greek 
authorities and the Athens Drug Enforcement Administration 
office, and demonstrates strengthening of Greek law 
enforcement institutions, an MPP strategic objective.  This 
successful case is a testament to Greek authorities' 
commitment to cooperating with U.S. DEA authorities to 
disrupt criminal organizations.
