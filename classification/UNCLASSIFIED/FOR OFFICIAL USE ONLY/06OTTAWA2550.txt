¶1.  (SBU) On August 25, EMIN presented ref A demarche to 
Douglas Williams, Director General, Middle East and Maghreb 
Directorate, Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA), which is Canada's counterpart to USAID.  According to 
Williams, Canada's delegation to the August 31 Stockholm 
Conference for Lebanon's Early Recovery will be headed by 
Gilles Rivard, Vice President, Europe, Middle East and 
Maghreb Branch, Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA).  Other delegation members are Douglas Williams; 
Catherine Bragg, Director General, Humanitarian Assistance, 
Peace and Security Directorate, CIDA; and Peter McRae, 
Director, Middle East Division, Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Canada (DFAIT).   Williams thought that 
others may join the delegation over the weekend.  There is a 
possibility of a "political figure" being added, possibly a 
Canadian Member of Parliament, but below the Ministerial 
level. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Since the beginning of the Lebanon crisis last 
month, Canada has made three public statements on its aid to 
Lebanon.  On August 16, Prime Minister Harper announced the 
formation of a new Lebanon Relief Fund through which Canada 
will give C$25 million for Lebanon reconstruction and relief 
efforts over the next two years.  C$15 million will be 
largely directed to UN agencies and the ICRC.  Williams said 
that some of the C$15 million would go to Canadian NGOs and 
to the UN Mine Action Service for the clearance of unexploded 
ordinance.  A portion would go to the UN Development Program 
in response to its early recovery appeal.  This would be used 
for municipal infrastructure repair, the clearance of rubble, 
aid to displaced fishermen, and oil spill clean up. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Williams indicated that C$10 million will support 
stabilization efforts and provide civilian support for 
implementation of UNSCR 1701.  DFAIT is preparing options on 
how this money may be used to enhance peace and security. 
The August 16 C$25 million aid package supplements previous 
Canadian aid for Lebanon announced in late July, which totals 
C$5.5 million.  Ref B provides details on the aid's 
composition and distribution as announced by the Prime 
Minister. 
 
¶5. (SBU) According to Williams, the Prime Minister's Office 
(PMO) is studying the possibility of additional Canadian aid, 
which could be announced prior to the Stockholm meeting.  He 
indicated that Canada has "modest expectations" for the 
outcome of the conference, which he said is being given a 
high profile by the Swedish government because of the 
upcoming Swedish elections. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Williams noted that the Canadian Embassy in Beirut 
is already involved in small-scale reconstruction 
initiatives, and this effort may be expanded in the future. 
He told EMIN that Canada expects details on reconstruction 
assistance to be elaborated at a major reconstruction 
conference to be held in Lebanon in late October or November. 
 However, Williams admitted that one impediment to Canada's 
distribution of aid, especially to towns in southern Lebanon, 
where Hezbollah has some governmental power, is that 
organization's designation as a terrorist group under 
Canada's criminal code.  This renders Hezbollah ineligible 
for Canadian assistance. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Williams and Rivard plan to remain for the Stockholm 
International Donor Conference on the Humanitarian Situation 
QInternational Donor Conference on the Humanitarian Situation 
in the Palestinian Terrorities on September 1.  This meeting 
will discuss the UN appeal, which was launched in May. 
Williams said that Canada has given C$9 million in response 
to this appeal as well as to a similar one from UNRWA. 
Another C$1 million is being given to the Red Cross in Gaza. 
 There is a possibility of further Canadian contributions to 
the Palestinian Territories through the World Food Program 
(WFP), UNRWA and other UN agencies, but it is not clear when 
this might be announced.
