¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  On July 23, the March 14 Secretariat held a 
workshop at the Bristol Hotel in Beirut to discuss and incorporate 
public opinion into a draft paper on civil peace and building a 
state of independence.  The paper concluded that it is impossible to 
build such a state while Hizballah possesses weapons.  The paper 
also called for and outlined how to revitalize the solidarity 
sparked by the 2005 Cedar Revolution.  The workshop is part of the 
Secretariat's ongoing efforts to reconnect with its constituency and 
develop a common political program.  End Summary. 
 
ATTENDEES OF VARIOUS 
BACKGROUNDS 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.   (U) Approximately 70 people attended the March 14 workshop 
entitled "Civil Peace and Building of the State of Independence" at 
the Bristol hotel in Beirut on July 23.  Representatives from the 
March 14 coalition attended, including March 14 SYG Fares Souaid, 
MPs Samir Franjieh, Mostafa Allouch (Future Movement), George Adwan 
(Lebanese Forces, LF), Elias Atallah (Democratic Left), Dory 
Chamoun, head of the National Liberal Party, former MP Camille 
Ziadeh and Antoine Haddad(from the Democratic Renewal Party of 
Minister Nassib Lahoud), Michel Mecattaf (Kataeb party) and Eddy 
Abillama (LF), as well as journalists, academics, civil society and 
youth representatives from March 14.  Independent Shia figures such 
as Lokman Slim, Malek Mroueh, and Jad Akhaoui, and Tom Harb and 
Kamal Batal from the World Council of the Cedar Revolution also 
attended. 
 
SYG:  MARCH 14 IS MADE 
BY THE LEBANESE PEOPLE 
---------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) In his opening remarks, March 14 SYG Fares Souaid, 
suggesting that some people are hoping March 14 will break apart, 
asserted that, "The secret of March 14 is that it is made by the 
Lebanese people and is not a political movement."  He added that 
these workshops aim to engage public participation and to clarify a 
common political view.  Souaid noted that the workshop March 14 
planned to hold on Syrian-Lebanese relations was postponed because 
of the May clashes but will be held soon.  The Secretariat 
previously held workshops on the Ta'if Agreement (Ref B) and 
electoral reform. 
 
INDEPENDENCE CANNOT COEXIST 
WITH HIZBALLAH'S ARMS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) The workshop draft paper stressed that a "state of 
independence cannot be built in the presence of Hizballah weapons." 
It also called for revitalizing the Lebanese solidarity sparked by 
the 2005 Cedar Revolution in order to build a civil modern state. 
The paper outlined six ways to reignite this solidarity: 
 
-- Asserting the state's right to sole authority over the armed 
forces; 
 
-- Isolating Lebanon, at the military and security levels, from the 
regional conflict; 
 
-- Ensuring Lebanon's protection by asserting its allegiance to a 
new modern and open Arab regional scheme; 
 
-- Reinforcing national co-existence through building a strong state 
that is less influenced by confessional and partisan conflicts; 
 
-- Protecting the society by restoring the credibility of the 
Lebanese values that have been aggressed upon by the Syrian hegemony 
and corruption within the governmental institutions; 
 
-- Protecting civil peace. 
 
VIEWS FROM THE PUBLIC 
--------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Kamal Batal, from the World Council of the Cedar 
Revolution, called for placing all of Lebanon under UN Chapter VII 
authority and to prevent all weapon smuggling into the country.  He 
also spoke about abolishing all political parties that do not 
believe in the Lebanese entity, naming in particular the Syrian 
Socialist National Party and the (radical) Sunni Liberation party.

¶6.  (SBU) A youth from the Lebanese Forces noted that March 14's 
existence has become fragile and called for strengthening its 
position in the political arena.  He further questioned the position 
of some unnamed March 14 leaders, implying Carlos Edde (who recently 
left the alliance) and Walid Jumblatt. 
 
REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
THE "ORIGINAL" FPM 
------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) MP Samir Franjieh informed the audience that the paper was 
only a draft and their opinions would be taken into consideration 
for the final document, which will be presented to March 14 leaders 
for approval. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) One of March 14's biggest challenges in the run-up to the 
2009 parliamentary elections is reconnecting with its supports and 
regaining the momentum and unity that sparked the 2005 Cedar 
Revolution.  The convention that the bloc held on March 14th at the 
Biel conference center (Ref A) and follow-up workshops are the 
result of the Secretariat's efforts to address this challenge.  End 
comment.
