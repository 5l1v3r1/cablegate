SUBJECT:  Somali TFG Arms Sweep Begins--Heavy Fighting 
 
 
¶1.  (U)  Multiple sources report that heavy fighting between TFG 
forces and 
insurgents began in Mogadishu around 0600 this morning, March 21. 
Press 
reporting indicated that Ethiopian troops and tanks were supporting 
TFG troops; 
but by mid-afternoon, contacts in Mogadishu were reporting that the 
Ethiopian 
forces were less visible on the streets.  Fighting was concentrated 
in two 
neighborhoods:  Shirkole near the Ethiopian HQ at the former Ministry 
of Defense 
and across town in the vicinity of the Hotel Ramadan; but there are 
reports of 
more widespread shelling in the city and of large fires in Bakara 
Market. 
Sporadic fighting continues. 
 
¶2.  (U)  As of 1400 local, sources in Mogadishu were reporting up to 
60 dead and 
60 wounded.  An Ethiopian political official admitted to 34 Ethiopian 
casualties 
in the day's fighting.  Insurgents claimed to have captured up to 12 
TFG 
soldiers.  Press and Mogadishu contacts report that the bodies of 
between two 
and five dead TFG and/or Ethiopian soldiers (they were the same 
uniform) were 
dragged through the streets and set afire.  Pictures are being posted 
on several 
Somali news websites, as well as on Al Jazeera. 
 
¶3.  (U)  According to local sources in Mogadishu, TFG forces 
initially seemed to 
have the upper hand, but insurgents were seen to be gaining by 
mid-afternoon. 
These sources reported that the TFG had not made any statements about 
the day's 
events, leaving the residents to wonder whether the insurgents might 
actually 
have defeated government forces. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Comment.  The Somali Ambassador to Kenya stated at a press 
conference 
today in Nairobi that this battle was the beginning of the 
long-expected effort 
by the TFG to confiscate civilian arms in Mogadishu.  Numerous 
sources were 
indicating that this planned operation was engendering wide-spread 
popular anger 
in the city toward the TFG.  Whether or not the TFG is ultimately 
successful in 
this endeavor, popular resentment could make it difficult to hold a 
meaningful 
National Reconciliation Conference as scheduled in mid-April. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Comment continued.  The reported absence of Ethiopian 
combat support 
for TFG forces will make it difficult for the government's mostly 
inexperienced 
troops to make headway against a determined resistance from insurgent 
militia.
