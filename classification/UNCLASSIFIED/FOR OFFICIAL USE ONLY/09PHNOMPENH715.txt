¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: In a September 22 meeting with the Deputy 
Chief of Mission to discuss next steps on the U.S.-Lower 
Mekong Ministerial (Ref A), Secretary of State for ASEAN 
Affairs Kao Kim Hourn expressed enthusiasm for the initiative 
and praised the United States' "reengagement" in Southeast 
Asia.  He characterized the recent visit by Secretary Clinton 
to Phuket as a significant advancement which was greatly 
appreciated by ASEAN, and made suggestions for future 
engagement.  Kao Kim Hourn cited the need for ASEAN to have 
good relations with all dialog partners, including the United 
States, without alienating others such as China.  He then 
discussed ASEAN's frustration with Burma and expressed the 
desire that the new U.S. administration not allow the Burma 
issue to detract from other policy objectives in the region. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
EXCITEMENT OVER ENHANCED U.S.-ASEAN RELATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kao Kim Hourn, who will be traveling with Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Hor Namhong to the UN General Assembly 
later this week, relayed the Minister's enthusiasm regarding 
the U.S.-Lower Mekong Ministerial.  According to Kao Kim 
Hourn, the Minister is so excited about the initiative that 
he will highlight it in his speech to the UNGA on September 
¶26.  Kao Kim Hourn stated that the current U.S. 
administration's apparent shift in policy towards Southeast 
Asia is greatly appreciated by ASEAN, which is looking 
forward to expanding economic support and cooperation with 
all strategic partners such as Japan, South Korea, China and 
the U.S.  He said that while the U.S. was "busy elsewhere" in 
previous years, China had successfully projected its role in 
the region as a benign power which offered peace and 
stability, without obvious strings attached.  However, 
according to Kao Kim Hourn, Secretary Clinton's visit to 
Phuket and initiatives such as those discussed during the 
U.S.-Lower Mekong Ministerial, as well as the appointment of 
an Ambassador to ASEAN, have proved to the member states that 
"the United States is back" in Southeast Asia, which he sees 
as a win-win situation economically for all involved. 
 
BURMA REMAINS PROBLEMATIC 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Kao Kim Hourn expressed concern that, although the 
U.S.-ASEAN relationship is expanding, the U.S. policy towards 
Burma has been problematic for ASEAN in the past.  He stated 
that the U.S.-ASEAN relationship should be based on overall 
strategic and economic opportunities and not be "held hostage 
to a single country."  He added that ASEAN was not happy with 
Burma, a member state which often causes the others 
embarrassment.  However, he stressed that the best tactic to 
establish democracy and improve human rights in Burma is 
through engagement rather than isolation.  Echoing Prime 
Minister Hun Sen's similar remarks on Burma to visiting 
Senator Webb (Ref B), Kao Kim Hourn stated that Burma should 
release all political prisoners, especially Aung San Suu Kyi, 
and welcome international observers to validate the 2010 
national elections. 
 
SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE COOPERATION 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Kao Kim Hourn offered suggestions for several 
"non-traditional security" areas for future U.S. cooperation 
with ASEAN, and highlighted energy security as one of them. 
While some ASEAN countries, such as Cambodia, are looking 
into solar, wind and hydropower as alternative energy 
solutions, others, such as Burma, are considering nuclear 
energy proposals which could be problematic.  Other areas for 
cooperation include piracy, small arms/light weapons, 
trafficking in persons (including fraudulent adoptions), 
cyber crimes, drug trafficking, counterfeiting, and 
peacekeeping as a catalyst for reform. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Prior to accepting a job within the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Kao Kim Hourn 
headed a highly-regarded political and economic think tank in 
Cambodia.  He has been directly involved in ASEAN and 
specifically ASEAN-China relations for over 10 years, and was 
indispensable to Cambodia's entry into ASEAN in 1999.  The 
interest and enthusiasm he exhibited for the Lower Mekong 
 
PHNOM PENH 00000715  002 OF 002 
 
 
Ministerial and enhanced cooperation between the U.S. and 
ASEAN bodes well for current and future initiatives in the 
region, and we expect him to be a reliable and valuable 
partner as these initiatives are developed.  END COMMENT.
