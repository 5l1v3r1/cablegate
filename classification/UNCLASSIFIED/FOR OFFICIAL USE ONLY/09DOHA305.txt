SUBJECT: LETTER TO SECRETARY CLINTON ON DARFUR FROM 
MINISTER OF STATE AL-MAHMOUD 
 
¶1. (SBU) Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs alerted us late 
the afternoon of May 7 by phone to a faxed letter addressed 
to Secretary Clinton from Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs Ahmed Al-Mahmoud and requested immediate delivery of 
the communication. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Below is an unofficial Government of Qatar 
translation of the original Arabic letter: 
 
May 5, 2009 
 
Her Excellency Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
Secretary of State of the United States of America 
 
The State of Qatar, as you are aware, has been leading 
efforts for several months, in complete coordination with Mr. 
Djbrill Bassole the AU/UN Joint Chief Mediator for Darfur, in 
order to reach a negotiated solution for the conflict in 
Darfur. 
 
Such efforts, though slow, have achieved tangible progress 
and received necessary support from both the regional and 
international communities.  The Goodwill and 
Confidence-building Agreement, concluded between the 
Government of Sudan and the Justice and Equality Movement, 
which was signed in Doha last February, is considered a 
tangible result of the above-mentioned efforts. 
 
The State of Qatar, in coordination with the AU/UN Joint 
Chief Mediator, while appreciating your country's support, 
calls for the organization of a meeting in Doha during the 
current month of May, at the level of special representatives 
for Sudan of the five permanent member states of the UN 
Security Council and the European Union, for mutual 
consultations and an exchange of views on the outcome that 
has been yielded so far by the peace talks and to work out a 
joint perspective regarding the quick move towards the 
resumption of talks and the appropriate means to support 
them. 
 
The State of Qatar hopes that the anticipated meeting will 
reiterate the unity of the international community and its 
robust and sustainable support for the efforts exerted by the 
State of Qatar and the AU/UN Joint Mediator as well as the 
importance of continuing talks in Doha with a view to placing 
the peace process on a solid foundation.  The State of Qatar 
hopes that the foregoing meeting will adopt a joint 
communique which lays further emphasis on that support. 
 
The State of Qatar also relies so much on the engagement of 
the international community and the mobilization of 
international efforts aimed at reaching a comprehensive and 
just solution, which realizes peace, security, stability and 
brings about welfare to the people of Darfur, the rest of 
Sudan and the region at large. 
 
Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurance of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Ahmed bin Abdulla Al-Mahmoud 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Member of the 
Cabinet
