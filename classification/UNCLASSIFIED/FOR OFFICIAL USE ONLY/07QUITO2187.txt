NEW MINING LAW PLANNED; BIDS FOR MINOR OIL FIELDS 
 
 
¶1.  (U) The following is a weekly economic update for Ecuador that 
reports notable developments that are not reported by individual 
cables. 
 
OXY: Ecuador Revokes Leboeuf Contract 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Due to a conflict of interest, on September 18 the office of 
the Ecuadorian Attorney General cancelled its contract with U.S. law 
firm Leboeuf, Lamb, Greene and MacRae, which was to represent 
Ecuador in the Occidental (Oxy) arbitration process.  The move 
followed a September 5 letter from Oxy to the International Centre 
for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) outlining Leboeuf's 
conflict of interest.  Leboeuf presented the case to University of 
Pennsylvania law professor Geoffrey Hazard, a leading U.S. expert on 
legal ethics, who concluded that the firm's merger with Dewey 
Ballantine, LLP (which represents a subsidiary of Occidental) did 
pose a conflict of interest.  The Attorney General's office has 
filed a request with ICSID to delay proceedings until February 2008 
in order to find another firm to represent Ecuador. 
 
GOE Prepares New Mining Law 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) During a mining forum September 18, Minister of Petroleum 
and Mining Galo Chiriboga announced plans to draft a new mining law 
that would allow the State greater control of the sector.  The GOE 
has contemplated reforms to the current mining law, which does not 
allow for royalties, for some time.  According to Chiriboga, "the 
present law is absolutely permissive; the State role is limited to 
reviewing and granting requests only."  In addition to increased 
State participation in the sector, the Minister anticipates that a 
new mining law would allow the government to charge royalties.  Vice 
President of the Mining Chamber, Cesar Espinoza, reported that his 
chamber has not seen or been consulted on the potential new law. 
With so much uncertainty over what will happen with the sector, few 
companies are currently investing, even with high prices for metals. 
 
 
Ecuador Restarts Bid Process for Minor Oil Fields 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4.  (U) The GOE restarted the bid process for Ecuador's "marginal" 
oil fields (those producing 1% or less of the country's production), 
a continuation of the process from November 2006.  Bids on the eight 
fields were being evaluated the week of September 17-21.  The 
private Ecuadorian-Venezuelan consortium Petrolero Amazonico has 
thus far made the most bids, on seven of the eight fields.  The 
fields reportedly contain up to 120 million barrels of proven 
reserves.
