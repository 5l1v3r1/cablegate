¶1.  (U) Summary:  The Presidential Palace announced on 
Monday, July 23, that Mohammad Zahir Shah, the former King 
of Afghanistan has died.  The funeral and burial ceremonies 
have been scheduled for Tuesday, July 24 from 3:00 pm to 
6:00 pm.  Ambassador Wood will represent the USG at the 
funeral and has issued a press statement and condolence 
letter to President Karzai.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Zahir Shah's funeral is scheduled for Tuesday, July 
24, from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm.  The Ambassador will represent 
the USG at the funeral and has issued a press statement 
(see text in para 4).  Suggested language for press 
statements from President Bush and Secretary Rice have 
also been forwarded to the Department (SCA/A and SCA/PPD). 
The American flag at Embassy Kabul will be lowered during 
the three-day mourning period declared by President Karzai. 
 
¶3.  (U) Crowned in 1914, Mohammad Zahir Shah was the last 
king of Afghanistan, but spent three decades in exile in 
Italy beginning in 1973.  Upon his return to Afghanistan in 
2002, he stepped aside to make way for a democratically 
elected president.  The 2004 Constitution bestowed him 
with the title "Father of the Nation," a position that 
will disappear with his death.  Though not regarded as a 
particularly strong leader, Zahir Shah remained an 
important symbol of peace and unity in the country until 
his death.  President Karzai shared a close personal 
relationship with the former King.  Some 30,000 Afghans 
are reportedly expected to travel to Kabul to pay their 
last respects during the funeral. 
 
¶4.  (U) Text of press statement released by the Ambassador 
on Monday, July 23:  "We are saddened to learn about the 
passing of Mohammad Zahir Shah, Former King and Father of 
the Nation, today in Afghanistan.  The United States 
expresses its condolences to his family and to the people 
and government of Afghanistan.  The United States reaffirms 
to the people of Afghanistan our commitment to Mohammad 
Zahir Shah's vision of a united, democratic, prosperous, 
and peaceful Afghanistan."
