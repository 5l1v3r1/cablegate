¶1.  (SBU) During a May 12 meeting with MFA Sudan Office 
Deputy Director Abdelmoneim Omar, poloff explored the current 
Egyptian contribution to the African Union (AU)'s Mission in 
Sudan (AMIS), drawing from reftel talking points to express 
appreciation for Egypt's continued and expanding involvement 
in the AU mission.  Omar said that as a result of 
consultations between President Mubarak and other African 
leaders on the margins of a New Partnership for Africa's 
Development (NEPAD) summit in Egypt April 19, Egypt had sent 
a letter ("about 2 weeks ago") to the African Union offering 
to provide the AU with a mechanized infantry battalion (158 
personnel) for its Military Protection Force in Darfur. 
Egypt had earlier communicated to the AU that it was also 
willing to increase its current contribution of civil police 
observers from 21 up to a maximum of 100.  As for military 
monitors, Egypt has offered to increase "by any amount 
requested" its current contribution of 34 monitors.  Omar 
complained of the slowness of the AU bureaucracy and lack of 
response, regarding Egypt's open offer to provide military 
monitors. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Egypt's current contributions to the three separate 
parts of the AMIS mission are as follows: 
 
- Military Protection Force:  The GOE recently offered (in 
writing) a mechanized infantry battalion consisting of 158 
personnel.  This would be Egypt's first contribution to this 
force.  No answer has been received from the AU, according to 
the Egyptian MFA. 
 
- Military Monitoring Force:  The GOE has 34 observers on the 
ground and has offered to provide "any number" that the AU 
formally requests from Egypt. 
 
- Civil Police Monitors:  Egypt currently has 21 civilian 
police observers on the ground in Darfur and has conveyed to 
the AU its willingness to increase that number to a maximum 
of 100 observers.
