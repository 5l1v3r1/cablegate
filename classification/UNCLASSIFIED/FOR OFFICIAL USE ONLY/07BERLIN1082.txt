SUBJECT: U.S. INVITATION PASSED TO GERMANY CONCERNING AN 
OPEN-ENDED SEMINAR TO DISCUSS UNSCR 1737 AND 1747 
IMPLEMENTATION 
 
REF: STATE 69283 
 
¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs officer passed ref invitation May 23 
to Joerg Polster, German MFA International Energy and Nuclear 
Energy Policy desk officer.  Polster, who had attended the 
NSG Plenary and related meetings in Cape Town, South Africa, 
from April 16-20, queried the need for the U.S.-hosted 
meeting in Vienna in advance of the IAEA Board of Governors' 
meeting.  In his view, since all the NSG partners had already 
discussed in Cape Town the U.S. proposal for a technical 
working group to discuss technical aspects of national 
implementation of UNSCRs 1737 and 1747, nothing new would be 
discussed in a U.S.-hosted meeting in Vienna during the week 
of June 4.  Polster suggested that because the invitees to 
the U.S.-hosted meeting will act in national capacities, it 
is unnecessary to for them to meet collectively to discuss 
these issues again outside the NSG.  Nevertheless, he said he 
will convey the invitation to appropriate German government 
officials.  Polster said he expects only members of the 
German mission to the IAEA in Vienna to attend. 
 
¶2. (U) Post will report any other substantive German response 
septel.
