SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S MEETING WITH BRAZIL-US PARLIAMENTARY 
GROUP 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Ambassador Sobel met with members of the 
Brazil-U.S. Parliamentary Group (GPBE) on November 30 to 
discuss bilateral relations and ways to increase contacts 
between the GPBE and members of the House of Representatives. 
 Ambassador offered to arrange a forum at the Embassy early 
next year to continue to the discussion.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador, accompanied by poloffs, paid a courtesy 
call on members of the Brazil-U.S. Parliamentary Group on 
November 30 at the Chamber of Deputies.  He opened by noting 
that he hopes several senior U.S. officials will visit Brazil 
in the near future.  He said he would like to increase 
contacts between the GPBE and members of the U.S. House of 
Representatives and would be interested in hearing the 
Group's views on ways this could be done.  He also invited 
them to share their thoughts on how U.S. CoDels can meet 
their counterparts more regularly, and to talk about their 
interest in Washington, whether collectively or individually. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Federal Deputy Luiz Carlos Hauly (Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party - Parana state), GPBE chairman, said he 
warmly welcomed the Ambassador's visit to the group, which 
includes 135 Federal Deputies and 19 Senators.  He said that 
just in the previous week he had assumed the presidency of 
the Inter-Parliamentary Forum of the Americas (FIPA), whose 
mission is to bring parliaments closer together, and he would 
like Brazil to be a key player in the FIPA. 
 
Slave Labor Allegations 
----------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Federal Deputy Fernando Gabeira (Green Party ) Rio 
de Janeiro state) raised the issue of slave labor accusations 
recently made by members of the U.S. Congress.  He said he 
did not agree with the "offended" manner in which the 
Brazilian Foreign Ministry had reacted, and called it 
"inappropriate."  He said Brazil is doing well in its combat 
against human slavery and is willing to cooperate with 
queries from the U.S. Congress.  Ambassador said this is an 
issue on which everyone is united in opposition, and the 
Embassy is prepared to help the U.S. Congress if asked, but 
always acting in collaboration with the Brazilian 
authorities.  He also mentioned funds that have been made 
available by President Bush for programs in this area. 
 
Peace Corps 
----------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Federal Deputy Feu Rosa (Progressive Party ) 
Espirito Santo) said his state would benefit from Peace Corps 
volunteers, but the Foreign Ministry, possibly because of 
"misunderstandings," would not look favorably on this, and 
said the executive branch is simply not interested in the 
subject.  Ambassador said we would welcome a Brazilian 
expression of interest in the Peace Corps.  He added the USG 
would consider using the Peace Corps in lusophone countries 
in joint programs with Brazil. 
 
Congressional Exchanges 
----------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Several deputies were interested in discussing the 
modalities of ensuring useful contacts between deputies and 
representatives.  Gabeira said he would propose to the next 
president of the Chamber of Deputies that more trips to the 
U.S. be arranged, but that it would be important to try to 
match up members' interests by subject matter so as to 
maximize the usefulness of the trips.  Hauly added that when 
the Group, accompanied by Chamber President Aldo Rebelo, had 
been with Speaker Dennis Hastert they had proposed regular 
exchanges, and Rebelo had given Hastert a letter elaborating 
on that.  These exchanges could be through the caucuses or 
arranged through committees, and should also include staff. 
(Note: the Brazilian deputies visited Washington in May 2006. 
 As far as Mission is aware, there has been no follow-up 
action thus far from the U.S. side in response to Chamber 
President Rebelo's letter urging more exchanges between our 
congresses.  End note.) 
 
Visas 
----- 
 
 
BRASILIA 00002563  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Deputies from northeastern states, where tourism is 
important, said many Americans do not come to Brazil because 
of its visa requirement for Americans.  They said a bill has 
been introduced in Congress to eliminate the requirement. 
They also appealed for better treatment of Brazilian visa 
applicants.  Ambassador said we now have the ability to 
separate out applications from students and business 
travelers and expedite them.  He encouraged the Brazilians to 
press for more direct flights between U.S. and Brazilian 
cities to increase Brazil's attractiveness to U.S. tourists. 
 
FTAA 
---- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The Ambassador was asked whether the U.S. was still 
interested in the Free Trade Areas of the Americas. 
Ambassador recounted the Bush Administration's early 
determination to focus on Latin America.  Other events had 
diminished some of the focus, but the U.S. is still 
interested in Latin America and very interested in Brazil, he 
said.  Ambassador mentioned the upcoming visit to the U.S. by 
President Lula and said both sides are interested in 
discussing a strategic partnership, bio-combustibles, 
investment, and other topics. 
 
Bilateral Investment Treaty 
--------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The Ambassador turned the discussion to the 
prospects for a bi-lateral investment treaty.  Gabeira said 
it was not a question of resistance to the idea in the 
Congress but that Congress is unprepared to take it up.  He 
said next year the Chamber will establish a committee on 
foreign trade.  Hauly opined that China gets far more trade 
attention from the U.S. than Brazil, while Brazil is a 
democracy and offers guarantees for investment. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Hauly reiterated the group's willingness to 
continue discussion on this and other topics.  He said they 
would like to take advantage of U.S. leadership and move 
Brazil forward.  Ambassador offered to arrange a forum at the 
Embassy with appropriate section chiefs to continue the 
discussion.
