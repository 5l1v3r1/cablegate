¶1. (U) Further to Reftel, we have continued to follow up with 
MFA contacts re GOCR interest in a seat on the UN Human 
Rights Council.  While Deputy Director for Foreign Policy 
Alejandro Solano earlier had shared our concerns about the 
negative impact of Venezuela taking a seat on the UNHRC, he 
was emphatic that the GOCR did not have the "institutional 
capacity" to focus on more than one major UN election 
campaign at a time. Therefore, Costa Rica's "one and only" UN 
election focus for 2007 likely would be for the upcoming 
GRULAC vacancy on the Security Council, he stressed. 
 
¶2. (U) On February 5, Antonio Alarcon, CoS to FM Bruno Stagno 
subsequently confirmed his earlier preliminary response 
(REFTEL) and echoed Solano's comments: Costa Rica will not 
pursue any UN candidacies in 2007 other than for the UNSC. 
Alarcon, who conferred briefly with Stagno while Poloffs 
waited in his office, made clear that his definitive response 
came directly from the FM.  Alarcon joked that the best 
alternative candidate for GOCR might be the Dominican 
Republic, if this removed the DR from the GRULAC UNSC race.
