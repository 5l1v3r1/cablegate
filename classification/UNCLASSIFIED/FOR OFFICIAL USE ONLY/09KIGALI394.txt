(SBU)  Pol/Econ Counselor delivered reftel A demarche to 
Joseph Kabakeza, Director General for Bilateral and 
Multilateral Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(mission subsequently delivered reftel B non-paper, also). 
Kabakeza acknowledged the importance of properly implementing 
1874's measures to prevent North Korean transfer of nuclear, 
ballistic and other materials.  While noting that Rwanda had 
no seaports, and only a limited number of flights through its 
international airport in Kigali, Kabakeza said that 
comprehensive port security was essential in preventing a 
variety of illicit activity.  From North Korean contraband 
shipments, to narco-trafficking, to terrorist inroads, "it's 
important" to be vigilant, he said.
