SUBJECT: GEORGIA ACTION REQUEST: VOTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR 
DRAFT RESOLUTION 
 
REF: A. USUN 102 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 6467 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST.  Subsequent to USUN's 
Ref A Action Request, USUN has engaged in further 
negotiations with the Russian Federation, United Kingdom, 
France, Croatia and Germany ("Group of Friends") on the text 
of a Security Council resolution that would extend the UN 
Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) for four months, until 
June 15, 2009.  These negotiations resulted in the text 
contained in paragraph 6.  The text, which contains the 
essential elements outlined in Ref B instructions, would 
extend the mission under its current mandate for four months, 
(i.e., a technical rollover) while reinforcing Georgia's 
territorial integrity by reference to Resolution 1808.  It 
contains most of the additional elements proposed by the 
French that were outlined in Ref B instructions including: 
reinforcement of the need for a security zone to be respected 
pending agreement on a new security regime; a call for 
intensification of efforts to address security and stability 
issues and the return of refugees and IDPs through the 
discussions underway in Geneva; reference to the August 12, 
2008 ceasefire agreement and subsequent implementing measures 
of September 8, 2008.  In negotiating with Russia, USUN has 
held firm to redlines on participation of Abkhaz de facto 
authorities in New York, and has made certain that the agenda 
item for adoption will be, "The Situation in Georgia."  USUN 
requests Department concurrence to co-sponsor the draft text 
with other members of the Group of Friends and to vote in 
favor of adoption.  USUN needs Department concurrence for 
co-sponsorship by OOB on February 12, 2009.  END SUMMARY AND 
ACTION REQUEST. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Per Ref B instructions, USUN has secured agreement 
among the Group of Friends on a resolution that provides for 
an extension of the current UNOMIG mandate to continue beyond 
its February 15, 2009 expiration date.  USUN moved the 
negotiations along with minimum conflict and successfully 
blocked Russian attempts to weaken the Council's support for 
Georgia's territorial integrity by changing the name of the 
agenda item or inviting Abkhaz de facto authorities to appear 
in New York. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A draft resolution was informally circulated by 
France on February 10, and USUN expects the Secretariat to 
put the draft in blue (i.e., formally introduce it) during 
the morning of February 12 in advance of a scheduled February 
13 adoption.  The text of the draft resolution is contained 
in paragraph 6. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The draft resolution will allow UNOMIG to continue 
its valuable work as the only international presence in 
Abkhazia. It contains the essential elements of the French 
proposal outlined in Ref B: it reinforces the need for the 
security zone outlined in paragraph 2(a) of the former Moscow 
Agreement-- which is the basis for the UNOMIG mandate-- to be 
respected; it calls for the intensification of efforts to 
address security and stability issues and the return of 
refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) through the 
discussions underway in Geneva; it reinforces the August 12, 
2008 ceasefire agreement and subsequent implementing measures 
of September 8, 2008; and it calls on the Secretary-General 
to engage with the parties through the Geneva process to 
reach agreement on a comprehensive security regime, which 
could serve as the basis of a new mandate. 
 
¶5. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST.  USUN requests Department 
concurrence to co-sponsor the draft resolution outlined in 
paragraph 6 and to vote in favor of its adoption.  USUN 
requests a Department response by OOB on Thursday February 
19, since resolutions are typically put in blue 24 hours in 
advance of adoption.  END ACTION REQUEST.

of a future UN presence in the region by 15 June

referred to in paragraph 6, the Geneva discussions, 
and developments on the ground;

Nations mission for a new period terminating on 15
