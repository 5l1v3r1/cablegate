¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points to MFA Pakistan Desk 
Officer Tobias Grothe on March 11 and asked that Germany 
support urgent appeals for assistance to Pakistan's 
internally displaced persons (IDPs).  Grothe said he would 
coordinate with the MFA desk responsible UN humanitarian 
assistance and get back to us.  During a March 16 follow-up 
conversation, Grothe said the German government agreed that 
the IDP situation in Pakistan was of serious concern, but a 
decision on what kind of contribution Germany would make had 
not yet been reached.  He believed a decision would be 
forthcoming soon.

Head of Section, Emergency and Transitional Assistance, World 
Food Program and Crisis Team, Federal Ministry of Cooperation 
and Development (BMZ).  Faehrmann said BMZ was not planning 
on providing any emergency food aid at this time.  She 
conceded, however, that this could change, and she did not 
rule out providing such assistance in the future. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy Berlin will report septel on any 
developments with regard to Germany's contributions in 
support of Pakistan,s IDPs as new information comes 
available.
