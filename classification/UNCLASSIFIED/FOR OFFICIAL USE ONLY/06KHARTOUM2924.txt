¶1. (SBU) During a December 27 meeting with MFA Director of Americas 
Badawi al-Sanosi, Pol/Econ Counselor raised the matter of the 
detained containers pertaining to the New Embassy Compound (NEC), as 
in reftels. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Al-Sanosi responded that he had tried several times to 
obtain an update from State Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmed Ali 
Karti, but had not been able to meet with him.  As such, he had no 
news to offer, but expressed hopes that there might be a "gift 
coming by New Year." 
 
¶3. (U) On December 27, the Sudan Vision Daily, a 
government-affiliated daily, published an interview with Charge Hume 
that included the following closing exchange:

Q:  U.S. Embassy will build its premises for the consulate in Juba. 
What are your plans for your embassy here in Khartoum, you are not 
planning to have a big Embassy in Khartoum like many U.S. Embassies 
worldwide? 
 
A:  No, we are trying to build an Embassy here in Khartoum with a 
value of over $100 million, but, your government, contrary to the 
Vienna Convention, has delayed the release of supplies, putting the 
entire project at risk.  If this project is cancelled, I am sure 
that that cancellation will draw a large, unfavorable notice in the 
U.S.  Through this interview, I urge the Sudanese government to meet 
its obligations under the Vienna Convention and release those 
supplies.
