¶1. (SBU) Summary: Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology 
(CSIST) confirmed reftel order from Eugenix Systems through 
consignee Pegasus Hi-Tek Co. Pegasus President William Mar also 
provided copies of the order for 20 rate gyros. End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ref A requested that AIT/T confirm the subject business 
transaction with the end user, CSIST, and visit the consignee, 
Pegasus, to determine its reliability.  Because AIT Econoff visited

not need to conduct another site visit (ref C).

and received his responses that (1) CSIST did place the order of 20 
rate gyros (P/N: RG02-0103-1) to Pegasus Hi-Tek Co., and (2) CSIST 
will use these gyros from manufacturer Eugenix Systems as rotary 
axis rate sensors for the CS/MPQ-561N shipboard tracking radar 
antenna pedestal under development by the Institute. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Pegasus Hi-Tek President William Mar provided AIT/T a copy

gyros.  Please note that Pegasus' address should be 6F-9, No. 270,
