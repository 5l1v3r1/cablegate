SUBJECT: PRESS ACCREDITATION FOR POPE'S VISIT TO ISTANBUL 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Turkish press today carried a story accusing 
the Ecumenical Patriarchate of trying to usurp the 
government's role by issuing press credentials to reporters 
covering the Pope's visit later this month.  According to the 
story, members of the press must receive accreditation both 
from the General Directorate of Media and Information (BYEGM) 
in the Prime Minister's office and separately from the 
Patriarchate to be admitted to the Patriarchate and an 
off-site press center.  Papers quoted BYEGM Director Izzet 
Ibrikcioglu as saying its accreditation should be sufficient. 
 Patriarchate representative Paul Gikas, on the other hand, 
explained that limited space, particularly in the relatively 
small St. Georges Church on the Patriarchate grounds, 
required limiting access.  Gikas suggested the use of the 
word "registration" might be more accurate than 
"accreditation." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to Gikas, the Patriarchate plans to 
establish a Press Center at the Hilton Hotel with a pool 
camera feed and standard press facilities.  The Pope will be 
traveling with 70 members of the press from the Vatican.  The 
Vatican has requested that 25 of these traveling press be 
given access to the events at the Fener church.  The 
Patriarchate plans to select another 25 from registration 
applications received for access to the Patriarchate grounds 
and church.  Gikas said the accreditation by the BYEGM was 
required for registration with the Patriarchate; all those 
accredited by the BYEGM would be registered and given access 
to the Press Center in the Hilton.  He noted that 
Patriarchate Director of Communications the Very Reverend 
Dositheos Anagnostopoulos had discussed these arrangements 
with the Governor of Istanbul Muammer Guler (note: the 
Governor is reponsible for security). 
 
¶3.  (U) November 14 was the closing date for filing 
applications for press credentials with the BYEGM; the 
Patriarchate is accepting applications until November 20, 
according to the web site, www.patriarchate.org. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment.  It's not unusual that the media should 
focus on media arrangements in connection withe the Papal 
visit, but the angle of this story - and its implicit 
suggestion that this is yet another way for the Partriarchate 
to establish its independence from the Turkish state - is 
further indication of the continued high sensitivity 
regarding the Pope's upcoming visit.  End comment.
