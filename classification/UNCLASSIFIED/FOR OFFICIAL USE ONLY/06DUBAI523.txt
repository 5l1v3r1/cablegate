SUBJECT: IRANIAN GOVERNMENT REACTS TO IAEA VOTE 
 
1.(U) Summary: According to February 5 press reports, President 
Ahmadinejad responded to the IAEA vote by "rescinding adherence 
to the Additional Protocol to the NPT" and "ordering 
commencement of all research and development of nuclear fuel 
technology for peaceful purposes, within the framework of the 
NPT and IAEA safeguard agreements."  Javad Vaedi, Iran's 
spokesperson for the negotiating team to IAEA, said negotiations 
with Russia over its offer to enrich uranium in Russia would 
continue but could be moot if Iran began its own enrichment. 
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Asefi said Iran was still willing 
to negotiate with the international community over its nuclear 
program and said Iran would be meeting Russia February 16. End 
Summary. 
 
2.(U) As reported by Iran's official news agency, IRNA, 
President Ahmadinejad sent a letter February 5 to the head of 
the Iran Atomic Energy Organization (IAEO) in which he ordered 
implementation of the law passed November 3, 2005 by the Majles. 
The letter came on the heels of the IAEA Board of Governors vote 
the previous day to report Iran to the UN Security Council; in 
the letter Ahmadinejad ordered the following: 
 
- commencement of all research, development, and 
preparatory-related work on nuclear full-cycle technology for 
peaceful purposes; 
 
- a comprehensive call on all experts and academics of national 
universities and research institutions to work with the IAEO for 
further development of indigenous capabilities for peaceful use 
of nuclear technology; 
 
- suspension, as of February 5, of the implementation of the 
Additional Protocol and additional cooperation with the IAEA. 
 
3.(U) The letter specified that all of Iran's "peaceful nuclear 
activities" would be carried out "within the framework and 
provision of the NPT and IAEA safeguard agreements" and that 
cooperation with the IAEA to observe all technical and legal 
commitments would continue within this framework. 
 
4.(U) Javad Vaedi, spokesperson for Iran's negotiating team to 
the IAEA and deputy secretary of the Supreme National Security 
Council, told reporters after the vote February 4 that Iran does 
not consider the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution as an 
expression of the international community's will, but rather a 
message "only from Western governments."  He said Iran would 
proceed with negotiations with Russia on its offer to enrich 
uranium in Russia, but that "if enrichment begins in Natanz, we 
will have no need for Russian supply." 
 
5.(U) Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hamid Reza Asefi told a 
press conference February 5 that Iran was still willing to 
negotiate with the international community over its nuclear 
program, as reported by AP.  He said Iran would hold talks with 
Russia February 16 on its enrichment offer.  Asefi said Iran 
does not fear the UNSC and that the IAEA vote was "not the end 
of the world." 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.(SBU) Iran's reaction to pressure typically mixes bravado with 
pragmatism.  Ahmedinejad is trying to play it both ways, 
claiming he has "no choice" but to end compliance with the 
Additional Protocol, out of "respect" for the law that 
parliament passed last year, while at the same time pointedly 
avoiding closing the door to further diplomatic negotiations in 
the run-up to March, when Iran's case is due to come up for 
further debate.
