¶1. (SBU) Charge raised Ref A demarche points with Deputy 
Foreign Minister Ambassador William Bull in an August 27 
meeting.  Bull told Charge that he will discuss the Viktor 
Bout situation with relevant Liberian authorities.  He noted 
the GOL's neutral position regarding the prosecution of 
former President Charles Taylor at the Special Court for 
Sierra Leone in The Hague, but confirmed that the GOL 
understands the significance of bringing Bout to justice. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Charge stressed the importance of GOL weigh-in with 
the Royal Thai Government on the harm that Bout did in 
Africa.  Bull assured Charge that the GOL will respond to the 
fullest extent possible.  He also asked Charge if it would be 
possible for the USG to share any information on specific 
Bout activities concerning Liberia.  Bull also noted that the 
GOL has no embassy in Thailand and any message will likely be 
passed via the Thai Embassy in Dakar, Senegal.
