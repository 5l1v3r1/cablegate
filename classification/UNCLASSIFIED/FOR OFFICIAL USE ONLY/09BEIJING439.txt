SUBJECT: CHINA SHARES NPT PREPCOM AND REVCON PRIORITIES 
 
REF: STATE 6970 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  PolOff discussed reftel questions 
regarding China's priorities for the upcoming Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) third Preparatory Committee 
(PrepCom) and 2010 NPT Review Conference (RevCon) with MFA 
Arms Control and Disarmament Department Nuclear Division 
Deputy Director Dai Huaicheng on February 20.  Dai stressed 
China's belief that the three NPT pillars must be advanced 
"in a balanced way" in order to make progress and avoid 
conflict during the NPT review process.  Noting the "common 
interests" shared by China and the United States within Q 
NPT regime, Dai called for "new elements and positive 
actions" from the United States in nonproliferation and 
disarmament efforts.  On the question of NPT noncompliance 
such as with Iran and North Korea, Dai indicated China's 
belief that these issues are most effectively addressed by 
other means such as the Six-Party Talks process.  Dai 
stressed the importance of agreeing on a clear agenda for the 
2010 RevCon at the upcoming May PrepCom, in order to avoid 
the "failure" of the 2005 RevCon.  End Summary. 
 
China's NPT Objectives 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Deputy Director Dai told PolOff on February 20 that, 
although the NPT had "encountered challenges over the past 
ten years," China still believed the NPT was "the foundation 
of the world nonproliferation regime."  Therefore, continued 
Dai, China felt the current NPT review process was "of great 
significance" and should "enhance the NPT's authority, 
effectiveness and universality in order to enhance global 
peace and stability."  China hoped that the "positive 
initiatives" from last year's RevCon "combined with a new 
U.S. Administration" would provide opportunities "to advance 
the three pillars of the NPT in a balanced way" at the 2010 
NPT RevCon. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Dai stressed that China held it was "important to 
properly deal with the interrelationships among the three 
pillars" and warned that failure to address issues in all 
three pillars "would lead to conflict and failure."  "The P5 
bears primary responsibility for pushing forward the agenda 
in a balanced way," according to Dai.  If that occurred, NPT 
members might "reach consensus on a joint declaration 
covering all three pillars" at the 2010 RevCon, Dai said. 
 
May PrepCom Priorities 
---------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Calling the 2005 RevCon "a failure since eighty 
percent of the time was spent discussing procedural issues," 
Dai said China believed the most important outcome from the 
May PrepCom would be "a clear agenda for the 2010 Review 
Conference." 
 
The U.S. Role 
------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Dai said "China and the United States share many 
common interests in the NPT review process."  "The leading 
role of the United States in the international 
nonproliferation regime is quite important, but we lost some 
chances for progress on nonproliferation over the past ten 
years," asserted Dai.  He said China hoped that "once the new 
U.S. administration finishes reviewing nonproliferation 
policies" there would be "some new elements and positive 
actions" from the United States, "not only within the NPT but 
also in its bilateral disarmament efforts with Russia." 
 
Iran and North Korea 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Dai said that while North Korean and Iranian 
noncompliance could be discussed at the NPT RevCon, China 
believed that venue "is not the place to take detailed 
steps."  Instead, "efforts should continue via the Six-Party 
Talks and other processes," asserted Dai. 
 
Violation of or Withdrawal from the NPT 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Noting that "some NPT member countries want strict 
measures and consequences in place for violating or 
withdrawing from the NPT," Dai said "proper measures must be 
discussed within the NPT framework." 
 
Lack of NPT Universality 
------------------------ 
 
¶8. (SBU) Dai said the question of countries remaining outside 
the NPT was "quite complicated," and declared that while "we 
cannot acknowledge the nuclear status of non-NPT signatories, 
we must bring them into the game."  "This is particularly 
important as the P5 reduce their nuclear arsenals," he added. 
 
IAEA Additional Protocol 
------------------------ 
 
¶9. (SBU) Dai said China welcomed the recent completion of 
steps in the United States to bring into force the Additional 
Protocol, and stated China would "work with the United States 
and other countries to foster ratification of the Additional 
Protocol by more and more countries." 
 
Enrichment and Reprocessing 
--------------------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) "China believes we must address nonproliferation 
issues as countries assert their right to the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy," stressed Dai.  Regarding concerns over 
enrichment and reprocessing, Dai said that while China 
"welcomes and is open to discuss proposals by the UK, Russia 
and others," China generally maintained it "is better to have 
some type of multilateral arrangement or agreement."  Dai 
suggested that NPT members "review all the current proposals" 
and seek a "mutually agreeable arrangement using the best 
parts of each proposal."
