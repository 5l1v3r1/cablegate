¶1. (SBU) Summary: According to Saad Bendidi, Chairman and CEO of 
palace-controlled conglomerate ONA, the Morocco-U.S. FTA is not 
significant.  This is in part because Morocco produces little to 
allow it to take advantage of such bilateral agreements.  In 
addition, the U.S. market's complexity makes it hard to access, and 
potential businessmen consider factors such as the overall business 
climate before an FTA when considering a market.  Bendidi believes 
that solid business opportunities for Morocco abound regionally and 
with China.  Despite severe drought this year, he feels Morocco's 
economic outlook is strong, with growth fueled by investment and 
consumption.  Bendidi's comments concerning the FTA suggest the need 
for further programs to promote it.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
CEO SAYS FTA NOT SIGNIFICANT 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On August 8, 2007, CG and Econoff met with Saad Bendidi, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Omnium Nord Africain 
(ONA), a palace-controlled conglomerate headquartered in Casablanca. 
The meeting focused on the Morocco-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA), 
which Bendidi feels is not significant to Morocco.  He cordially 
expressed this sentiment in numerous ways, saying that the FTA is not 
"transformational" or "fundamental," that it is not an economic 
driver, and that its benefits are a mirage.  He went so far as to say 
that it may have a negative effect on Morocco's economy, and that the 
FTA with the U.S. is not part of the way Moroccans think. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bendidi thinks the FTA is not significant for several 
reasons.  First, he believes Morocco negotiates "asymmetric" 
bilateral agreements from which the country cannot benefit.  In his 
eyes, Morocco produces little and has a narrow market that prevents 
it from engaging in the type of reciprocal trade that such agreements 
are designed to encourage.  It was this perception that led him to 
remark that the FTA "has a negative effect in a way," as well as the 
fact that only certain sectors, such as agriculture, are affected. 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to Bendidi, the complexity of accessing the U.S. 
market also diminishes the FTA's importance.  Given the U.S.'s 
immense size, he wondered how Moroccan businesses could target 
partners.  He also lamented the lack of step-by-step guidance on how 
to put the agreement's provisions into practice.  With the exception 
of those who have prior exposure to the U.S., for example as 
students, he contends that few Moroccan businessmen access the U.S. 
market, and those who want to are afraid. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Part of Bendidi's skepticism regarding the FTA lies in his 
approach to examining markets.  He said that a businessman does not 
start with questions such as, 'What is the tax rate?,' which the FTA 
might impact, but rather with more general questions - is there an 
opportunity, can I make a profit, are business conditions good?  Only 
after addressing these issues would someone consider the FTA, making 
it less potent than it may seem. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES CLOSER TO HOME - AND IN CHINA 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The appeal and plenty of regional opportunities may best 
explain Bendidi's assessment of the FTA.  Just because you have a 
text, he said, does not mean you have opportunities.  One needs 
relationships, such as those Morocco already has with neighboring 
Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia, and Turkey.  Given that "the 
potential in the region has been proven more than that with the 
U.S.," Morocco has decided to collaborate with such countries first, 
followed by Europe, which is much closer than the U.S.  Bendidi finds 
regional integration more "interesting" than transatlantic 
cooperation and wants to see more FTAs with Morocco's regional 
counterparts. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Outside the region, Bendidi says Morocco is more occupied 
with China than the U.S.  Last May, 25 ONA associates spent ten days 
in China to conduct a review and visit suppliers.  Bendidi plainly 
stated that he has more interest in what China has to offer - cobalt 
and zinc, for example - than the U.S.  (One of ONA's many 
subsidiaries is a mining company).  Even if China is untested as a 
business partner, it is viewed as competitive in the region, while 
the U.S. is not. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
POSITIVE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, DROUGHT ASIDE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Bendidi presented a positive outlook on the economy, saying 
that growth in Morocco is good if you extract the effect of drought. 
In fact, he said, the sugar crop was better this year than last in 
irrigated areas.  ONA's supermarkets have seen double-digit growth in 
2007, and cement and iron consumption surpassed 15 percent at the end 
of May.  Despite these examples, Bendidi's perspective seems at odds 
with reports of the drought's negative impact.  With the cereal 
harvest radically reduced, unemployment has increased from 7.8 
percent in the second quarter of 2006 to 9.4 percent this year, and 
the GOM reports a loss of 93,000 jobs in the farming sector. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Overall, two factors explain Morocco's strong economic 
position in Bendidi's eyes - investment and consumption.  While he 
conceded that the public and private sectors, as well as non-profits, 
must support impoverished communities, he maintained that in cities 
and some rural areas, consumption is increasing, fueling growth.  He 
noted that Morocco has people with the knowledge, capital and 
motivation to help the country move forward on its own steam. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Comment: Bendidi echoes some of the sentiments of 
Casablanca businesspeople who feel it is difficult to take advantage 
of the FTA.  His comments underscore the need for further programs to 
demystify the FTA and assist Moroccans in finding practical ways to 
benefit from it.  End Comment.
