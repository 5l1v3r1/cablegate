SUBJECT: SLOVAKIA WILL SUPPORT UK-FRENCH DRAFT RESOLUTION 
ON IRAN 
 
REF: 197807 
 
¶1. Slovakia will likely support the UK-French draft UNSCR on 
Iran, according to Ambassador Vladimir Lomen of the UNSC 
Coordination Unit at MFA. Lomen told Poloff the UK had 
lobbied the GoS hard for support and that the matter was 
being considered in the FM's office as of the morning of 
December 12. Poloff witnessed a French diplomat lobbying FM 
Kubis on the issue as well. GoS officials told the UK that 
Slovakia will advocate a common EU position in support of the 
draft UNSCR, and that Slovakia would even consider 
co-sponsoring the draft if the U.S. supports it. 
 
¶2. Lomen suggested that the U.S. lobby hard for Russian 
support for the draft UNSCR, but expressed doubt that the 
Russians would accept the draft unless it is significantly 
watered down.
