SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #17 
 
¶1.      (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
February 27, 2010. Please visit the following link for additional 
classified reporting: 
 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency U.S. Government (USG) Joint Operations Center 
(JOC) can be contacted on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 
¶4013. 
 
 
 
¶2.      (U//FOUO//LES) Canadian and USG authorities are currently 
unaware of any specific, credible threats to the Games as the 
Closing Ceremonies approach Sunday, February 28, at 5:30 p.m. PST. 
BC Place will open to ticket holders at 1:30 p.m. PST. 
Anti-Olympics demonstrations scheduled for Sunday are not expected 
to affect the Closing Ceremonies. 
 
 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶3.      (U)  USA, Canada to face off in Gold Medal Hockey Game - 
Friday's semifinal games set the stage for the much-anticipated 
Gold Medal match between Teams USA and Canada.  As with previous 
games between the perennial rivals, concerns exist as to the 
potentially contentious nature of Sunday's 12:15 p.m. PST game at 
Canada Hockey Place (CHP) and its impact on public order. Downtown 
liquor stores will restrict alcohol sales through the weekend in an 
attempt to mitigate potential incidents. CHP is located within 
blocks of Vancouver's entertainment district, primary pedestrian 
corridors, and many hotels. 
 
¶4.      (U//FOUO//LES) Mass exodus expected at Vancouver 
International Airport March 1 - A record number of passengers - an 
estimated 40,000 - is expected to depart the Vancouver 
International Airport (YVR) on March 1.  The crush of travelers may 
create delays, potential confrontations between passengers and 
security/airport staff, and safety/crowd control problems in an 
emergency. Canadian authorities are currently unaware of any 
threats to YVR. 
 
 
 
Protests: 
 
 
 
¶5.      (U) February 26 Protest Activity - The "Critical Mass Bike 
Ride" transpired without incident. 
 
 
 
¶6.      (U//FOUO//LES) Current Protest Activity - The "Pirates of 
Justice" flash mob - a group protesting working conditions on 
Olympic security accommodation vessels - is scheduled for noon 
today adjacent to Canada Place. This group's previous activities 
were not associated with property damage or violence. Approximately 
seventy attendees are currently registered for this demonstration. 
 
 
 
¶7.      (U//FOUO//LES) The anti-homelessness advocacy group Red 
Tent is staging an "Olympic Wrap-Up" demonstration at Canada 
Pavilion (Dunsmuir and Beatty, approximately 2 blocks NE of Canada 
Hockey Place) at noon PST today.  Demonstrators plan to assemble at 
 
Keefer and Abbott Streets then move approximately one block west to 
Canada Pavilion.  Once at Canada Pavilion, activists intend to set 
up 142 red tarps and use 1700 feet of "messaging" to "wrap the 
entire pavilion" as part of their call for an end to homelessness. 
Protesters are encouraged to bring a paintbrush, instruments, and 
sleeping gear to stay overnight. The march from the assembly area 
at Keefer and Abbott Streets to the Pavilion will likely disrupt 
traffic and temporarily obstruct public access to the exhibit, but 
it not anticipated to interfere with any Olympic events. 
 
 
 
¶8.      (U//FOUO//LES) Anticipated Protest Activity - The "Games 
Over! Resistance Lives!" demonstration is scheduled to take place 
from 1 to 5 p.m. on February 28 at the intersection of Smithe and 
Cambie Streets, several blocks south of BC Place. This 
demonstration has 171 attendees currently confirmed and is expected 
to be peaceful. 
 
 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶9.      (U//FOUO//LES)  At c. 10:50 a.m. PST today, TSA and CBP JOC 
sources received word of a suspicious item at the Vancouver Airport 
international terminal. The suspicious item - an outbound 
passenger's bag - was inspected and found benign by CBP and 
Canadian law enforcement personnel.  No further action was required 
by Canadian or USG personnel and the incident is considered closed. 
No other Olympics-related security incidents occurred during this 
reporting period. 
 
Threats: 
 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
transnational terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
 
 
¶11.   (SBU) Diplomatic Security remains engaged in daily USOC team 
movements. 
 
 
 
¶12.  (SBU) Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet 
Napolitano, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, 
and US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice will depart Vancouver March 
¶1.  The VIP delegation is scheduled to attend several events, 
including the Men's Gold Medal Hockey match at Canada Hockey Place
