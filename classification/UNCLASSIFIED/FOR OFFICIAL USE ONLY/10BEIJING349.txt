¶1. (U) Post relayed on February 2 the background information and 
points regarding U.S. proposals at the March 13-25 Conference of 
Parties (COP) of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) contained in REF A to the CITES Management Authority 
Office of the China State Forestry Administration (SFA).  On 
February 5, Deputy Director General MENG Xianlin provided the below 
written response. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Begin text (edited for fluency): 
 
Dear Colleague, 
 
Thank you for the materials provided along with your fax of February 
2, 2010--it is helpful to review the U.S. positions on relevant 
proposals before the COP. 
 
We have done a preliminary review and also sent these materials to 
relevant wildlife authorities for further review. 
 
Regarding the positions on certain species, please take the 
following general principles for your reference: 
 
--China is in favor of comments and proposals from range countries 
in most cases.  This will guide our decisionmaking on species like 
polar bears and bobcats.  The polar bear's major threat is habitat 
loss and habitat quality, which is already reflected in your own 
explanation.  Therefore the comments of large exporting countries 
and those with the healthiest wild populations must also be 
thoroughly examined and considered before we reach a final decision. 
 Regarding bobcats, we have indicated our general support for this 
proposal during frequent discussions in the past.  Our final 
decision will be made based on the principle that CITES listings 
should be more related to the status of wild populations. 
 
--For the shark proposal, we are concerned about several issues, 
including how "introduction from the sea" concerns would be 
addressed, identification problems for enforcement purposes, the 
difference between fisheries resources and terrestrial species, and 
also misleading information about the consumption of fins, which the 
proposal currently focuses on Asia. 
 
--Regarding the coral proposal, we have not reached a consensus for 
our final position, which is currently being discussed with our 
colleagues in the Fisheries Bureau (under the Ministry of 
Agriculture). 
 
--For CITES/COP 15, SFA's CITES Management Authority office will 
take the lead coordinating position.  Generally, the Wildlife 
Conservation Department of the State Forestry Administration (SFA) 
will lead on terrestrial species and the Fisheries Bureau of the 
Ministry of Agriculture will lead on aquatic species.  Nonetheless, 
for all COP 15 issues, we prefer that you contact the CITES 
Management Authority of China (within SFA), which will deal with all 
inquiries according to internal procedures. 
 
Thank you very much for the information and we look forward to 
seeing and working together with you in Qatar. 
 
Best Regards, 
 
(Mr.) MENG Xianlin 
Deputy Director General 
CITES Management Authority of China

¶3. (U)  In addition, SFA's CITES Office indicated to ESTHOff that 
due to scheduling difficulties, the proposed digital video 
conference (DVC) involving Chinese authorities, the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, and State/OES/ENRC the week of February 22 would 
not be possible.  SFA further stated that the background information 
provided in REF A, as well as the in-person consultation they had 
with OES/ENRC Officer Danielle Wood on January 20, now preclude the 
need for an in-depth bilateral discussion via DVC.
