 ¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Trade Development Agency (TDA) Regional 
Director Carl Kress visited the West Bank in August to 
follow-up on WiMax and Internet data center studies, and to 
discuss new projects that would promote economic development 
and generate U.S. exports.  Private sector representatives 
and PA officials suggested projects related to geothermal 
energy, fuel storage, and infrastructure at Rawabi's 
affordable housing project. End Summary. 
 
IT Sector Constrained by Spectrum 
Allocation, Equipment Procurement 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) CEO of BCI Communications Said Baransi said a new 
contractor is moving forward on the TDA-funded feasibility 
study (reftel C) for WiMax broadband wireless Internet access 
in 10 West Bank cities, although the project's success is 
still dependent on the GOI's release of frequencies in the 
3.5 GHz range, as requested by the PA in May 2008 (reftel B). 
 Baransi says that WiMax is on the agenda for the next GOI-PA 
Joint Technical Committee (JTC) meeting, now pending for over 
a year.  Baransi added that he has been asked to brief the 
JTC on WiMax and its frequency needs.  He noted that WiMax 
may be implemented in Israel by the end of 2009, which would 
remove the GOI's ostensible reason for blocking the project 
in the West Bank.  Baransi commented that it is becoming 
increasingly difficult to obtain permits from the GOI to 
bring IT equipment (and imports in general) in to the West 
Bank. 
 
Sustainable Energy and Fuel Storage 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Amin Bashir, Director General of the General 
Petroleum Corporation (part of the Ministry of Finance), 
stressed that the PA urgently needed to upgrade and modernize 
its fuel storage capacity.  He requested TDA assistance on a 
feasibility study to add fuel storage at the Tarqumiya and 
Tulkarem crossings and upgrade the existing Nilin facilities. 
 The GOI reportedly intends for the Tulkarem crossing to 
replace Nilin, but Bashir stressed that he needed to maintain 
the much closer Nilin location to supply Ramallah.  Paz, the 
Israeli company that is the sole distributor for the West 
Bank's fuel, has offered to supply the equipment at the 
Tarqumiya crossing, according to Bashir.  A TDA contractor is 
assisting the GPC in developing a proposal and notes that USG 
components of the project could include metering, monitoring, 
and pumping equipment.  (Note: Bashir assumed his current 
duties last year, when Palestinian PM Fayyad brought him in 
to "clean-up" the GPC, he said.) 
 
¶4. (U) MENA Geothermal, a privately-held company, requested 
TDA assistance with a feasibility study on a centralized 
geothermal plant in an affordable housing complex.  The 
technology, which is currently in use on a smaller scale at 
an office building in Ramallah, saves 70% on energy costs and 
relies on U.S. equipment.  MENA is also developing proposals 
for geothermal heating and cooling at the PA's new ministry 
complex, as well as the Rawabi and Al-Reehan affordable 
housing projects. 
 
Rawabi Proposes Feasibility Study on 
Telecom Network, Wastewater Treatment 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Amir Dajani from the Rawabi project proposed 
feasibility studies on design and operation of a telecom 
network infrastructure and a wastewater treatment facility. 
He expects that the telecom network would utilize equipment 
from Cisco, 3M, or Intel, and would include security systems, 
a fiber optic network, and broadband.  However, he noted that 
the telecom network is one of the first infrastructure 
systems that Rawabi will install, so TDA's proposed timeline 
of a February-March feasibility study might come too late, 
assuming Rawabi begins construction this fall as scheduled 
(reftel A).  On wastewater, Rawabi intends to install a 
tertiary treatment facility, adding to the system as demand 
 
JERUSALEM 00001463  002 OF 002 
 
 
grows, with the goal of re-using 80-90% of the wastewater. 
Because the project will be modular, implementation is more 
flexible and it might be a better fit for TDA. 
 
Stone and Marble Industry Reps Seek Funding for Equipment 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶6. (U) In a meeting with 15 representatives from the stone 
and marble industry, Chairman of the Union of Stone and 
Marble Industry Subhi Thawabteh stressed that the increased 
cost of shipping back-to-back through Tarqumiya and lack of 
access to Area C quarries remained the industry's most 
pressing concerns.  Following up on the TDA-funded August 
2008 marble and stone orientation visit to the United States, 
the businessmen noted that U.S. equipment was more expensive 
and less specialized than its Italian competition. 
 
¶7. (U)  TDA's Carl Kress cleared this message.
