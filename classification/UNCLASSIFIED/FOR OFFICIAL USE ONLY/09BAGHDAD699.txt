¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. As previously reported in an email to 
CA/OCS/ACS/NESA February 12, ConOffs met with the five AmCit 
residents of Camp Ashraf on December 31, 2008 and February 
12, 2009. 
 
All five are in good condition. Despite Embassy 
encouragement to consider their futures as individuals 
outside of Camp Ashraf, they all expressed a strong desire 
to remain in the Camp. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) ConOffs met with the AmCit residents of Camp 
Ashraf on two occasions. The December 31st meeting was the 
first Consular visit since 2007. ConOffs met with the 
AmCits as a group and then individually. ConOffs briefly 
interviewed each of the subjects to determine if they were 
in fact American citizens, and inquired if they wanted to 
leave the Camp for the U.S. or other destinations. ConOffs 
offered to facilitate passport processing if the subjects 
wished to leave the Camp. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On February 12, ConOff briefed the AmCits on 
the changed circumstances at the Camp (REF A), urged them to 
consider that the Camp would eventually close, and stated 
that they needed to think about their future as individuals 
outside of the Mujahedin e-Khalq (MEK). ConOffs also noted 
that while the U.S. does have a role in observing Iraqi 
interactions with the Camp, as of January 1, responsibility 
for the Camp and its residents reverted to the GoI. The 
AmCit residents understood the changed circumstances, but 
maintained their pre-programmed speeches about the MEK's 
role in opposing the Iranian government and reiterated 
their determination to remain in the Camp. During both 
meetings, the AmCits declined to apply for passports. 
 
¶4. (SBU) ConOffs were able to confirm that two of the 
subjects (Elham Kiamanesh and Mohammed Bigdeli,) are 
American Citizens with existing PIERS records. They are 
also the subject of indictments in the U.S. (REF B) 
Kiamanesh is aware of the warrant for her arrest as she was 
so informed when she was denied a passport in 2006 (REF C). 
The charges against Bigdeli were filed subsequent to his 
passport application in 2006. His passport was printed and 
delivered to him, but was limited in validity and has since 
expired. He may not be aware of the charges against him. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Another subject, Ali Reza Assazadeh, may be 
an AmCit, but ConOffs were unable to confirm his identity. 
His PIERS record shows a childhood photograph and 
additional due diligence must be conducted to determine 
identity. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The two remaining subjects (Sahar Moadab and 
Gohar Mohajeri,) claim to be born in the U.S. However, 
their parents brought them to Camp Ashraf as infants and 
they have no documentation proving birth in the U.S. 
Another known AmCit, Kazem Tahmassebi, is deceased. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Camp Ashraf AmCits are as follows

Elham Kiamanesh, DOB XXXXXX 
Mohammad Bigdeli, DOB XXXXXX 
Ali Reza Assazadeh, DOB XXXXXX
