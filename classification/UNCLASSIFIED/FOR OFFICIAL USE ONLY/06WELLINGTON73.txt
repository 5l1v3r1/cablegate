WOOD PACKAGING MATERIALS 
 
REF: 05 STATE 210901 
 
¶1. (U) Post on November 21 delivered reftel points to the 
European Division of the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade and to the International Policy Division of 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF).  In response, 
Meredith Stokdijk, acting director of MAF's International 
Policy Division, wrote in a January 20 letter that New 
Zealand would continue to encourage the European Union not to 
impose unilateral requirements for wood packaging materials 
that would likely undermine the adoption of the international 
standard, ISPM 15, internationally. 
 
¶2. (U) In her letter, Stokdijk said that her government 
acknowledged that the EU's debarking measure was not a 
standard requirement of ISPM 15.  "New Zealand does not 
believe that taking a measure against bark is unjustified, 
but rather that the implementation of any such requirement 
should not impede the international adoption of ISPM 15," she 
wrote. 
 
¶3. (U) Stokdijk noted that New Zealand requires all imported 
wood packaging materials (WPM) to be bark-free but that, 
rather than requiring debarking as part of ISPM 15 
compliance, bark "is removed or treated on arrival before 
being allowed clearance into New Zealand."  In essence, she 
wrote, this means that New Zealand's requirements do not 
impede the flow of ISPM 15-compliant WPM internationally. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Essentially, it is tough for the Kiwis to 
argue against the EU implementing a practice that New Zealand 
already requires.  New Zealand does share our concern that an 
EU debarking provision could cause serious disruptions to 
trade.  It also places the highest priority on the 
international adoption of ISPM 15.  New Zealand expects the 
EU probably will again suspend implementation of a debarking 
requirement for WPM for another year.  The International 
Plant Protection Convention's (IPPC) Technical Panel on 
Forest Quarantine is scheduled to meet in June 2006 and will 
review the technical merits supporting debarking as well as 
the feasibility of enforcement.  Michael Ormsby of 
Biosecurity New Zealand chairs the IPPC's technical panel.
