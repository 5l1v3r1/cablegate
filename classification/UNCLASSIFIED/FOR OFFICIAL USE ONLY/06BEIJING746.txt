SUBJECT: U.S.-CHINA WORKING GROUP MEETS WITH NPC SECRETARY 
GENERAL SHENG HUAREN 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Parliamentary exchanges between the United 
States Congress and the NPC have been very successful 
over the past year, NPC Secretary General Sheng Huaren 
told a visiting delegation from the U.S.-China Working 
Group led by Congressmen Mark Kirk, Rick Larsen and 
Tom Feeney.  China is keeping a close eye on the 
EU/Iran nuclear dialogue, but other countries should 
not become too involved.  China calls for patience in 
dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. End 
summary. 
 
Inter-parliamentary Exchanges 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The U.S.-China Working Group would like to 
increase regular exchanges with the NPC, Congressman 
Kirk told NPC Secretary General Sheng Huaren in their 
January 10 meeting.  The NPC already has many 
exchanges with the U.S. Senate through the U.S.-China 
Inter-Parliamentary Exchange as well as frequent 
ongoing exchanges with the House of Representatives 
U.S.-China Working Group, Sheng replied.  The NPC 
highly values its exchanges with the United States 
Congress and welcomes the activities of the Working 
Group.  The two sides noted that the next delegation 
of NPC deputies will head to Washington in March, 
which will be followed by a group of twelve U.S. 
Senators visiting China in August.  At the next 
meeting, Sheng said the U.S. side is interested in 
discussing security issues, energy issues, 
intellectual property rights, currency valuation, 
North Korean nuclear issues and non-proliferation. 
The discussion topics for the Chinese side will 
include Taiwan, the peaceful rise of China and 
bilateral trade frictions. 
 
EU Iran Nuclear Dialogue 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Congressman Kirk cited Congressional concern 
about the EU/IAEA nuclear dialogue with Iran and asked 
Secretary General Sheng's view on actions the United 
 
SIPDIS 
States and China could undertake to support a peaceful 
solution.  The world community is watching the EU/Iran 
nuclear discussions very closely, Sheng replied.  With 
regard to the Iran issue and non-proliferation, 
China's policy is consistent with that of the United 
States.  Nevertheless, the EU/Iran dialogue should be 
handled without interference from outside parties. 
This is a very sensitive issue and if too many 
countries become involved it will only lead to more 
problems. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Congressman Larsen expressed concerns about 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's statements on 
the nuclear issue and asked Sheng why he has 
confidence that Ahmadinejad's position can be 
moderated.  Sheng said China believes the EU and Iran 
should work out this problem and that others should 
allow them to do so. 
 
Six-party Talks 
--------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Congressman Feeney asked Sheng if China is 
prepared to do more to pressure the DPRK to give up 
its nuclear ambitions.  Sheng replied that patience is 
important in dealing with both Iran and the DPRK. 
However, the main problem in both cases is lack of 
trust on both sides.  China continues to work with all 
sides to encourage progress on the North Korean 
nuclear issue.  The maintenance of peace and stability 
on the Korean Peninsula through the Six-party Talks is 
in the interests of the United States and China.  The 
Chinese side has made enormous efforts to get the Six- 
Party Talks to move forward, and the United States and 
China should consult more closely on the problems.
