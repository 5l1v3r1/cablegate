¶1. (SBU) Summary.  President SBY identified climate change, 
investment and democracy as key priorities in public remarks 
delivered at a gala dinner hosted by the US-ASEAN Business Council 
on October 25th.  SBY highlighted the COP-13 conference in Bali as a

achieving a global framework on climate change.  He also outlined 
Indonesia's efforts to enhance its economic competitiveness.  He 
expressed satisfaction with U.S.-Indonesian relations and added that 
Indonesia is "actively recalibrating this important partnership" to 
put it on a higher level.  End Summary. 
 
Climate Change a Top Priority 
----------------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) President SBY described climate change as "at the top of 
my Government's agenda" and highlighted Indonesia as host of the 
United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Bali in December.  He 
expressed the goal that the conference will result in a "Bali 
Roadmap" that could serve as a blueprint to achieve a post-2012 
global framework on climate change.  He also reaffirmed Indonesia's 
commitment to addressing deforestation and expectations that 
forestry issues be integrated into any post-2012 framework. 
 
SBY Wants More Investment 
------------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) SBY discussed Indonesia's efforts to enhance its 
competitiveness, and attached great importance to attracting new 
investment.  He also emphasized growth with equity, explaining that 
economic growth must have a tangible impact on public good.  SBY 
touted Indonesia's strong macroeconomic condition and listed off 
reform initiatives including the new investment and customs laws as 
well as development of special economic zones (SEZs) and reduction 
of the number of days to start a business.  He also reaffirmed his 
commitment to increasing spending on health and education while 
maintaining a balanced budget. 
 
Democracy On the Move 
---------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) The President said that that "democracy is taking roots 
locally" and applauded the success of local elections throughout the 
country.  He described his ambition to change the orientation of 
Indonesian politics from the political elite to "more around the 
people, the way a democracy should be."  He highlighted reform 
efforts including the "strongest anti-corruption drive in our 
history."  The President also referenced his own strong electoral 
mandate resulting from the world's largest and most complex 
election. 
 
US-Indonesian Relations Strong 
------------------------------ 
¶5.  (SBU) SBY's remarks were mostly optimistic and forward thinking 
however he did warn of "tough days ahead" in the global economy 
exacerbated by skyrocketing oil prices as well as turbulence in 
global financial markets resulting from the sub-prime mortgage 
problem.  He expressed satisfaction with U.S.-Indonesian relations 
describing it as "solid and stable", adding that Indonesia is 
"actively recalibrating this important partnership" to put it on a 
higher level.
