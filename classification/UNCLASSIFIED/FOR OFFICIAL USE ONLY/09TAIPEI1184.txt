Reference: State 9650 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Taiwan has few domestic food-security concerns, 
but relies on imported food for 65 percent of its people's diet. 
Taiwan's main food-security concern is that, without access to most 
international organizations that address food security, Taiwan can 
neither access the latest information on food-related issues, nor 
provide domestic ideas, technology, and funding for reducing food 
insecurity in the APEC region.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On September 25, econoff met with Liang-yu Wang, Chief of 
the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Department of 
International Organizations APEC Task Force, and Tracy Tarng, Chief 
of the Council of Agriculture (COA) International Organizations 
Section, International Affairs Department. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Tarng and Wang, Taiwan has few domestic 
food-security concerns.  Although Taiwan is a mountainous, densely 
populated island, and is therefore only able to supply domestically 
about 35 percent of the calories its people consume, Taiwan makes up 
the rest through imports, mostly from the United States.  [Note: 
Taiwan relies on the U.S. for virtually all of its wheat, corn, and 
soybean imports. End note.]  Taiwan holds a three-month security 
reserve of 300,000 tons of rice.  Tarng and Wang think a blockade of 
Taiwan by a hostile power is unlikely, and are therefore not overly 
concerned about the island's reliance on imported food. 
 
 ¶4. (SBU) According to Ms. Wang, Taiwan's main regional 
food-security concern is that the island is not a member of, and has 
no access to, key international organizations that address food 
security.  Ms. Tarng pointed out that in 2007, due to rising oil 
prices, grains such as soybeans and corn were diverted to produce 
energy, causing international price fluctuations that deeply 
affected Taiwan.  Tarng added that, as a food-importing island and a 
technologically-advanced economy, Taiwan could both benefit from 
information exchange and dialogue with international organizations, 
and contribute ideas, technology, and funding for reducing food 
insecurity in the APEC region. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Tarng told econoff that Taiwan has been very active in 
food-aid programs since the 1960s, but over the past decade, in line 
with recommendations from the United Nations and other international 
aid organizations, has shifted to providing financial aid in lieu of 
direct food aid.  Taiwan also organizes agricultural technical 
missions to assist countries, especially its remaining diplomatic 
allies, in improving farm yields, irrigations systems, and basic 
agricultural infrastructure.
