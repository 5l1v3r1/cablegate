¶1. (U) This cable represents innovative reporting and commercial 
advocacy collaboration between Embassies Pretoria, Kinshasa, and 
Lusaka. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: International companies are investing in 
ambitious mega-projects on both sides of the DRC/Zambia 
copper-cobalt belt, despite significant government interference. 
The region represents the world's second greatest source of copper, 
after Chile, but it is widely viewed as possessing richer 
concentrations than Chile. The region is the world's greatest 
source of cobalt, which has suffered related price volatility. 
Companies are racing to bring on-line new production to take 
advantage of robust prices and demand, as well as to beat 
competition and political risk. Companies face significant risk 
from regulatory uncertainty, transportation/logistics, power 
supplies, and skills shortages. Zambia is marginally ahead of the 
DRC in the competition for the dubious title of greater government 
interference. DRC faces greater transportation, power, and skills 
challenges. Western companies are advancing high standards for 
social/skills development and safety/environmental standards. 
Chinese and Indian investors do not follow the same standards, but 
are promising significant infrastructure investment. The 
sedimentary-hosted geology is complex; there is no standard 
cookie-cutter mine in the copper belt, and the newest developments 
are increasingly situated outside the traditional belt's 
infrastructure and geology. End Summary. 
 
Geological Wonderland 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The African copper-cobalt belt (or Lufilian Arc) hosts an 
incredible quantity and variety of sedimentary-hosted oxide and 
sulphide copper-bearing deposits with associated cobalt. It is a 
world-scale deposit on a par with the South African Bushveld for 
platinum and Witwatersrand for gold. Reasonable geologists can 
debate for a long time on the complex geological phenomenon of 
sedimentation and the successive infiltration of salts, oxidants, 
organics, and other chemicals, in advance of tectonic action that 
formed the unique deposits at each mine. Each mine deposit requires 
a unique mining approach and chemical processing to extract an 
intermediate or final copper product for sale. But, this is usually 
the easy part, compared to grappling with government interference 
and logistics in and out of the mine. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Embassy Pretoria Mining/Energy Officer and Specialist 
visited mines on both sides of the DRC/Zambia copper belt May 12-23 
to assess developments in the sector, covering six mines in the DRC 
and four in Zambia. These mines represent the "A-list" of 
international investors and eventually will generate over one 
million tons of copper production per annum - with significant 
quantities of higher-value cobalt. Embassy Kinshasa Economic
