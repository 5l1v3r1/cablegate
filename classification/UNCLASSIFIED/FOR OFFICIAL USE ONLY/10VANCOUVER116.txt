SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #18 
 
¶1.       (SBU) This is the final report providing security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
February 28, 2010. Please visit the following link for additional 
classified reporting: 
 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency U.S. Government (USG) Joint Operations Center 
(JOC) can be contacted on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013 
until 0800 March 1. 
 
¶2.      (U//FOUO//LES) Canadian and USG authorities are currently 
unaware of any specific, credible threats to the Games as the 
Closing Ceremonies approach Sunday, February 28, at 5:30 p.m.  BC 
Place will open to ticket holders at 1:30 p.m. Anti-Olympics 
demonstrations scheduled for Sunday are not expected to affect the 
Closing Ceremonies; however, Canadian authorities assess 
anti-Olympic activism today will be more widespread, and possibly 
more disruptive, than previously anticipated. 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
¶3.      (U)  USA, Canada to face off in Gold Medal Hockey Game - 
The Gold Medal match between teams USA and Canada is underway at 
Canada Hockey Place (CHP).  Concerns remain as to the potentially 
contentious nature of today's game and its impact on public order. 
Downtown liquor stores are restricting alcohol sales through the 
weekend in an attempt to mitigate potential incidents. CHP is 
located within blocks of Vancouver's entertainment district, 
primary pedestrian corridors, and many hotels. 
 
Protests: 
 
¶4.      (U//FOUO//LES) February 27 Protest Activity - The "Pirates 
of Justice" flash mob occurred without incident yesterday adjacent 
to Canada Place. 
 
¶5.      (U//FOUO//LES) The anti-homelessness advocacy group Red 
Tent staged a peaceful "Olympic Wrap-Up" demonstration at Canada 
Pavilion (near CHP) at noon. Approximately 25 to 30 activists 
arranged 142 red tarps as a fence around the outside fence 
surrounding Canada Pavilion's Live Site entertainment venue. 
Vancouver Police were present during the demonstration. 
 
¶6.      (U//FOUO//LES) Current Protest Activity - The "Games Over! 
Resistance Lives!" demonstration is scheduled to take place from 1 
to 5 p.m. today at the intersection of Smithe and Cambie Streets, 
several blocks south of BC Place. Early information indicated 
organizers intended the event to be inoffensive to both police and 
the public; however, 171 attendees are currently confirmed and may 
block the intersection. Black Bloc advocates are likely to 
participate, although there is no indication that they intend to 
engage in violent or illegal tactics during this event. Online 
discussions of the event indicate a high proportion of participants 
may proceed afterwards to the Tent Village to join its supporters, 
a decision that could turn into an impromptu march. 
 
Incidents: 
 
¶7.      (U)  No Olympics-related security incidents occurred during 
this reporting period. 
 
Threats: 
 
¶8.      (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
transnational terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
¶9.      (SBU) Diplomatic Security remains engaged in daily USOC 
team movements. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet 
Napolitano, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, 
and US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice will depart Vancouver March 
¶1.  The VIP delegation is scheduled to attend several events, 
including the Men's Gold Medal Hockey match at Canada Hockey Place 
and the Closing Ceremonies.
