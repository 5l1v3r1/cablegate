SUBJECT: NGO REGISTRATION UPDATE: NOVEMBER 16 
 
REF: MOSCOW 12310 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Federal Registration Service (FRS) 
has now re-registered 159 foreign NGOs, including Human 
Rights Watch and Amnesty International.  We understand FRS 
has rejected five NGOs, although none appear to be U.S. 
organizations.  The authorities have disseminated draft 
guidelines governing reporting requirements for NGO community 
comment.  We are hearing NGO concerns, however, about tax 
filing and visa sponsorship issues that could make operations 
difficult.  We continue to closely track the situation and 
keep NGO registration concerns high on the agenda with the 
GOR.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) As of November 10, the FRS had re-registered 159 
NGOs.  Among them were Human Rights Watch and Amnesty 
International.  According to Galina Fokina, acting head of 
the registration section of the FRS, the applications of 29 
organizations still await processing.  The FRS has returned 
another 29 applications for corrections.  The FRS has refused 
re-registration to five NGOs, although Fokina told the press 
that they are "welcome to re-apply".  The FRS seems to be 
adhering to the requirement that it respond to NGOs within 30 
days. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Of the 29 NGOs USAID is tracking, 13 are still 
awaiting a decision on re-registration.  USAID contacts have 
told us that the FSB visited the International Rescue 
Committee to discuss the registration process and their 
programming activities, which raised concerns among the 
organization's leaders. 
 
¶4. (U)  The inter-agency committee responsible for clarifying 
periodic reporting requirements has disseminated draft 
guidelines to the NGO community for comment by the end of 
November. 
 
 
VISA SUPPORT AND TAX FILING QUANDARIES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) As mentioned in reftel, NGOs have told USAID 
contacts of their concerns that the law's drafters failed to 
address some of the mundane, yet critical, aspects of running 
a foreign NGO in Russia.  The Registration Chamber previously 
assisted with visa sponsorship for foreign NGO employees as 
part of its accreditation responsibilities.  With the 
enactment of the new NGO law, the Chamber no longer has this 
authority.  When AmCham drafted a letter to the Ministry of 
Justice requesting clarification on the issue, the Ministry 
responded that it was not within their competence. 
 
¶6. (SBU) According to USAID contacts, another concern NGOs 
have is connected to tax filings.  The FRS' strict attention 
to transliteration has left some NGOs in the position of 
being registered under one spelling with the FRS and another 
spelling with the tax authorities.  Further, the authorities 
have not yet sorted out the tax status of "sub-unit" offices 
who are ineligible for re-registration, but must still 
register individually with local tax authorities. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT.  We expect the re-registration process to 
continue over the next few weeks.  NGOs that re-submit their 
documents in a timely manner should be able to resume 
activities.  We were pleased to see engagement with the NGO 
community on the drafting of reporting guidelines.  We will 
follow up with appropriate authorities on the visa and tax 
issues and continue to monitor the registration process as it 
unfolds.
