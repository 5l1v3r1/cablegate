SUBJECT: RUSSIAN ENERGY: UPDATE ON SAKHALIN-1 OPERATIONS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) In light of press reports indicating that the GOR 
was slowing the Sakhalin-1 consortium's operations, we 
contacted ExxonMobil's Sakhalin office to get an update. 
According to Michael Allen, ExxonMobil's government relations 
head on Sakhalin, as of November 16 the consortium had still 
not received the necessary clearances from RosTekhNadzor (RTN 
-- the Russian environmental, industrial, and nuclear safety 
watchdog) that would allow for "full" operations at the 
De-Kastri oil terminal.  According to Allen, Sakhalin-1 is 
exporting on a "trial" basis in the sense that they are not 
yet producing -- and exporting -- the expected 250,000 
barrels per day (b/d) from the terminal.  Presently, they are 
producing roughly 100,000 b/d, all of which is being loaded 
on tankers and sent to global markets. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Allen said that they are moving in the right 
direction with RTN but describes the process as "start-stop." 
 He hopes that, once the consortium works through RTN's list 
of uncompleted requirements later this year that RTN and the 
Khabarovsk Kray government, where the oil terminal is 
located, will go ahead and issue the "full facility operating 
permit," paving the way for full production by the end of 
this year or early 2007.
