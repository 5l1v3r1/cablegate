SUBJECT: SINGAPORE SUPPORTS PRESIDENT'S IRAQ POLICY 
 
REF: STATE 3592 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ambassador Herbold briefed MFA Permanent Secretary 
Peter Ho on the elements of the President's new Iraq strategy 
on January 17, and thanked Singapore for its continuing 
support in Iraq (reftel).  Peter Ho told the Ambassador that 
Singapore strongly supports our Iraq policy and that it would 
continue to provide military support to the best of its 
ability.  (NOTE:  Singapore deploys LSTs, KC-135s and a C-130 
to the Gulf on a rotating basis and has provided other 
operational support.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Previously, the DCM and E/P Counselor separately 
discussed the President's strategy with senior MFA officials, 
who voiced similar support and characterized the President's 
decision as "brave" and "courageous."  The officials 
reaffirmed Singapore's view that defeat in Iraq would have 
grave consequences and reiterated Singapore's support for 
U.S. efforts.  One of the officials highlighted key themes 
from an article in the January/February issue of Foreign 
Affairs by Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, which 
provided a strong argument for the need to succeed in Iraq.
