SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) HOLY SEE COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR SUDAN LUCIO SEMBRANO 
TOLD US FEBRUARY 25 THAT WIDER PARTICIPATION IN THE DARFUR 
TALKS WOULD BE A KEY TO THEIR LONG-TERM SUCCESS.  HE 
DESCRIBED REPORTS OF ATROCITIES IN THE REGION, AND OUTLINED 
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH'S CAPACITY TO AID REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT. 
ON THE NORTH-SOUTH CONFLICT, SEMBRANO REITERATED THE HOLY 
SEE'S DESIRE FOR THE GOS TO ALLOW THE SUDANESE CATHOLIC 
BISHOPS' CONFERENCE A GREATER ROLE IN THE PEACE PROCESS AND 
IN WORK ON THE CONSTITUTION, WHILE WE NOTED THE NEED TO START 
SLOWLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DELICATE BALANCE OF SUCH 
EFFORTS.  ON INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE MORE GENERALLY, THE 
HOLY SEE BELIEVES THE SUDANESE BISHOPS ARE READY TO ENGAGE, 
AND JUST NEED AN OPENING FROM THE GOS AND SUDANESE MUSLIM 
AUTHORITIES.  THOUGH POST CANNOT GAUGE THE MINDSET OF THE 
BISHOPS, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE HOLY SEE HAS CREATED A 
DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE FOR DIALOGUE, WITH THE CREATION OF 
GABRIEL WAKO AS CARDINAL AND PAPAL PRESSURE ON THE BISHOPS 
DURING THEIR QUINQUENNIAL "AD LIMINA" VISIT TO ROME IN 
DECEMBER (REF C).  END SUMMARY.

¶2. (SBU) HOLY SEE COUNTRY DIRECTOR FOR SUDAN LUCIO SEMBRANO 
CONTACTED EMBASSY FEBRUARY 25 AND FOLLOWED UP ON FOREIGN 
MINISTER GIOVANNI LAJOLO'S DEMARCHE TO THE AMBASSADOR A WEEK 
    EARLIER (REF B).  ON DARFUR, SEMBRANO SAID HE HAD RECEIVED 
REPORTS FROM NGOS THAT MARAUDING GANGS IN THE REGION MAY HAVE 
USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON THEIR VICTIMS.  ACCORDING TO 
SEMBRANO, WITNESSES HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OF SUCH WEAPONS ON 
VICTIMS' BODIES.  SEMBRANO ALSO EMPHASIZED THE HOLY SEE'S 
VIEW THAT WIDER PARTICIPATION IN THE DARFUR TALKS WOULD HELP 
CREATE A MORE STABLE PEACE SETTLEMENT.  HE SAID IT MIGHT 
ENCOURAGE BUY-IN TO THE AGREEMENT FROM SOME SEEKING TO 
DISRUPT THE PROCESS.  TURNING TO HUMANITARIAN AID AND REFUGEE 
RESETTLEMENT IN DARFUR, SEMBRANO SAID THE HOLY SEE WAS 
WORKING THROUGH ITS DEVELOPMENT ARM, COR UNUM, WITH THE UN 
HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES (UNHCR).  WHEN PRESSED FOR 
WHAT OTHER CONCRETE ASSISTANCE THE HOLY SEE COULD GIVE TO 
SUCH EFFORTS (REF A), HE SAID IT WAS SOMEWHAT LIMITED. 
SEMBRANO NOTED THAT SOME TWENTY CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES WERE 
ACTIVE IN HUMANITARIAN WORK IN THE REGION, AND WERE IN 
CONTACT WITH THE SUDAN BISHOPS' CONFERENCE.  BUT THE 
CONFERENCE ITSELF HAD LITTLE MONEY, AND COULD CONTRIBUTE 
MAINLY THROUGH COMMUNICATION IN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY. 
WITH FEW CHRISTIANS IN DARFUR, THE LATTER STRATEGY WOULD 
HAVE LIMITED IMPACT, HE ACKNOWLEDGED.

INVOLVEMENT IN NORTH-SOUTH DIALOGUE 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) ON THE NORTH-SOUTH DIALOGUE, SEMBRANO EMPHASIZED THE 
VATICAN'S DISAPPOINTMENT WITH WHAT HE CALLED A LACK OF 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE GOS TO THE CHURCH.  HE SAID THE GOS 
HAS RELEGATED THE CHURCH TO A STATUS SOMEWHAT LIKE THAT OF AN 
NGO WHEN IN FACT IT WAS CRUCIAL FOR IT TO BE INVOLVED IN 
    PEACE AND CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS.  WE NOTED THAT IT MIGHT BE 
DIFFICULT FOR THE BISHOPS TO BECOME MORE INVOLVED IN 
NEGOTIATIONS AT THIS POINT, GIVEN THE CAREFUL BALANCE AND 
SENSITIVE STAGE OF THE DIALOGUE.  AS PER REF (A), WE 
SUGGESTED THAT THE CONFERENCE MIGHT OFFER THE HELP OF A LEGAL 
OR CONSTITUTIONAL EXPERT AS A WAY TO START SLOWLY ON THIS 
TACK.  SEMBRANO SAID THAT THERE WAS A BISHOPS' CONFERENCE 
OFFICE DEDICATED TO RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT, AND HE 
WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT LOOK INTO THE IDEA.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT 
THE CHURCH "KNOWS THE SOUTH" AND COULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO THE 
PROCESS -- IN ADDITION TO SAFEGUARDING THE IDEALS OF 
 
VATICAN 00000788  001.2 OF 002

¶4. (SBU) SEMBRANO TOLD US HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY RECENT 
ADVANCES IN INTER-RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE MORE GENERALLY, AND SAID 
HE HAD HEARD NO NEWS OF PROGRESS ON A NEW INTER-RELIGIOUS 
AGENCY IN SUDAN FOR THE COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN AID 
PROPOSED BY THE POPE IN DECEMBER (REF C).  HE INSISTED, 
HOWEVER, THAT THE SUDANESE BISHOPS WERE READY AND WILLING TO 
ENGAGE WITH MUSLIM INTERLOCUTORS.  WHEN REMINDED OF PAST 
HESITANCY ON THE BISHOPS' PART TO TRUST THEIR ERSTWHILE 
PERSECUTORS AND MOVE FORWARD, SEMBRANO ADMITTED IT HAD BEEN A 
DIFFICULT ROAD.  "BUT THE SITUATION IS DIFFERENT NOW," HE 
SAID.  "THEY HAVE A CARDINAL (GABRIEL WAKO) NOW, AND A BETTER 
IDEA OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH (THE PEACE AGREEMENT AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES) ARE GOING."  WE SUGGESTED THAT, GIVEN 
THE PERCEPTION THAT THE BISHOPS HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN READY 
FOR DIALOGUE, THEY NEEDED TO MAKE OVERTURES TO SIGNAL THEIR 
OPENNESS.  SEMBRANO SAID HE WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO SO.

COMMENT: A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE?

¶5. (SBU) WITH THE CREATION OF GABRIEL WAKO AS CARDINAL, AND 
PAPAL PRESSURE ON THE BISHOPS DURING THEIR QUINQUENNIAL "AD 
LIMINA" VISIT TO ROME IN DECEMBER TO OPEN UP TO DIALOGUE (REF 
C), THE HOLY SEE HAS CREATED A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE FOR THE 
CATHOLIC HIERARCHY'S ENGAGEMENT IN SUDAN.  WHEREAS IN 
DECEMBER, SEMBRANO HAD BEEN UNSURE OF THE EFFECT OF VATICAN 
LOBBYING EFFORTS ON THIS ACCOUNT (REF C), HE SHOWED NO SUCH 
HESITATION IN OUR MOST RECENT CONVERSATION.  THE HOLY SEE AT 
    THIS JUNCTURE FIRMLY BELIEVES THE SUDANESE BISHOPS WOULD 
RESPOND POSITIVELY TO AN OPENING OFFERED BY THE GOS AND/OR 
MUSLIM AUTHORITIES IN SUDAN.
