¶1.  (SBU) On Friday, April 25 the Ambassador raised reftel 
points with Minister Mahamat Ali Nassour. (Nassour is the 
outgoing Minister of Defense and was formerly Minister of the

Cease-Fire Commission when it was based in Chad and continues 
to be an important interlocutor for Darfur issues. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On Monday, April 28, DCM conveyed the points to 
Deputy Foreign Minister Djidda Moussa Outman.  Outman
