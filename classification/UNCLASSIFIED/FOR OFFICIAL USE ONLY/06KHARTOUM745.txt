¶4. (SBU) President Bashir attended the opening session along 
with Minister of Defense 1st Lieutenant General Hussein and 
Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Manibe.  All the speakers 
welcomed the establishment of the NMAA and termed its 
establishment a milestone in the implementation of the CPA. 
Representing SRSG Pronk, Dr Francis Kai Kai highlighted the 
need for demining Sudan to be a Sudanese process.  President 
Bashir, appearing bareheaded in a safari suit, highlighted 
the importance of the establishment of the NMAA as "one of 
the first fruits of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
(CPA)," and as a strong indicator of the commitment and 
determination of the Republic of the Sudan to address the 
landmine contamination problem.  Bashir also said the GNU 
has included mine action in its national budget for 2006 and 
will allocate funds for mine action in the coming years. 
First VP Salva Kiir spoke at the closing ceremony, thanking 
the UN, the donor community, and all other 
organizations/institutions that have assisted and supported 
the Sudanese authorities and people in addressing the 
landmine contamination problem in the Sudan.  Kiir made a 
strong appeal to all the UN agencies, the donor community 
and all other national and international bodies, to work 
closely with NMAA to build Sudanese management and 
operations capacities.  In addition, he appealed to the 
donor community to allocate special funds for building of 
local and national mine action capacities.
