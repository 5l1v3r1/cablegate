SUBJECT: IDF EASES ACCESS THROUGH THREE WEST BANK 
CHECKPOINTS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On June 3, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) 
eased access through three West Bank checkpoints, two around 
Ramallah and one north of Nablus.  ConGen officers verified 
on June 5 that some infrastructure has been removed at the 
two Ramallah-area checkpoints, one of which controls the main 
access route north of the city.  In Nablus, a checkpoint with 
limited operating hours will now be open 24 hours/day.  End 
summary. 
 
Freer Access through Atara CP Significant for Ramallah 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Palestinian Authority (PA) and other 
sources, the IDF began removing some infrastructure at two 
Ramallah-area checkpoints, Atara and Rimonim/At-Tayba, on 
June 3.  Atara, which controls the main northern access route 
to Ramallah, is the more significant opening.  Easing access 
through Atara facilitates movement between Ramallah and the 
Salfit area immediately to the north, and opens a direct 
route from northern Ramallah to the Nablus area via Route 60, 
the West Bank's main north-south artery.  Contacts in the 
Ramallah business community call the opening important for 
facilitating passenger car movement between Ramallah and 
points north, though the road is not a major commercial 
route.  A prominent Ramallah businesswoman told EconChief 
that property values north of the former checkpoint are 
already rising. 
 
¶3. (SBU) EconOffs visited Atara on June 5 and observed that 
tall concrete barriers inhibiting traffic flow had been 
removed.  Other infrastructure, including traffic lanes, 
guard booths, and a concrete observation tower, remain 
intact.  Four IDF soldiers observed traffic at the checkpoint 
but did not stop any vehicles.  Friday traffic was very 
light. 
 
Infrastructure Removed at Rimonim/At-Tayba Checkpoint 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) EconOffs observed that concrete blocks and jersey 
barriers at Rimonim/At-Tayba checkpoint have been removed.  A 
concrete observation tower and small IDF outpost near the 
checkpoint continue to be manned, but soldiers did not stop 
traffic during our observation.  Rimonim lies at a junction 
midway between Ramallah and Jericho and controls movement 
between the two cities, as well as on a secondary north-south 
route (route 458) commonly used by commercial traffic. 
Rimonim was previously "opened" in March 2008, but shortly 
thereafter, the IDF placed concrete blocks and plastic jersey 
barriers on the road and regularly checked passing vehicles. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Mayor David Khoury of nearby Taybeh village told 
Econoffs that he welcomed the freer access, but he cautioned 
that the IDF frequently sets up "flying checkpoints" in the 
area.  The Mayor added that the IDF opened a road gate near 
Ofra settlement about ten days ago that reduced travel time 
to Ramallah, but emphasized that the key to facilitating 
local access to Ramallah is removing Beit El checkpoint in 
east Ramallah. 
 
North Nablus Checkpoint to Operate 24 Hours/Day 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The IDF announced on June 3 that Asira ash-Shamalia 
checkpoint, previously open from 0500-2300, will now operate 
around the clock.  Asira ash-Shamalia controls one of the 
main northern roads out of Nablus.  Extending the hours of 
operation will facilitate personal travel between Nablus and 
villages to the north.  The winding, hilly road is not 
suitable for heavy commercial traffic.
