REF: JERUSALEM 1341 AND PREVIOUS 
 
(SBU) The World Health Organization's (WHO) representative in 
Gaza Mahmud Daher reported to EconOff April 11 that two new 
cases of Avian Influenza (AI) had been confirmed in a duck 
farm and a chicken farm in Jabaliya, bringing the total 
number of confirmed sites up to eight.  Daher said the PA had 
already started culling both areas.  He added that the PA has 
culled 339,986 birds in Gaza and plans to cull all ducks, 
which number 30,000.  According to Daher, the PA has agreed 
to implement WHO's recommendation that the PA cull another 
200,000 within the 3km radius of all confirmed sites. 
Palestinian farmers have not received any compensation, 
except a commitment from the PA that they will be paid for 
culling their infected flocks.
