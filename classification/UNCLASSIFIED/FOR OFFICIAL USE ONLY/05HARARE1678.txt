REF: STATE 193439 
 
¶1. (U) This cable responds to reftel request to update 
information for the 2005 Country Report on Terrorism. 
 
------------------ 
GENERAL ASSESSMENT 
------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Zimbabwe does not fit the criteria stipulated in 
paragraph 7 (a) (b) and (c) of reftel instructions.  Despite 
our strained bilateral relationship and the GOZ,s 
self-imposed isolation on most diplomatic issues, local 
intelligence and criminal investigative agencies to date have 
been very responsive to USG needs and concerns regarding 
terrorist issues.  At Embassy request, these agencies have 
routinely provided assistance by conducting investigative 
inquiries, traces, and border checks of individuals thought 
to be threats to USG facilities or personnel.  The government 
in 2004 passed the Anti-Money Laundering and Proceeds of 
Crime Act, which addresses terrorist financing and authorizes 
the tracking and seizing of assets.  Zimbabwe has yet to 
become a party to the UN International Convention for the 
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. 
 
-------------------- 
SANCTUARY ASSESSMENT 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) There is no credible evidence that the GOZ provides 
sanctuary to any international or indigenous terrorist group. 
 The GOZ does, however, maintain diplomatic relations with 
countries identified as being state sponsors of terrorism. 
Cuba, Iran, Libya, and Sudan have embassies in Harare and 
there is an emerging North Korean diplomatic presence in 
country. 
 
------------------------------- 
INFORMATION ON TERRORIST GROUPS 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) No terrorist cells were identified in by the GOZ in 
2005 and Post has no reason to believe that any are active in 
Zimbabwe.  In the past, Zimbabwe has not been a good 
operating environment for terrorist groups due to the 
country,s oppressive and omnipresent security and 
intelligence agencies.  This operating environment may, 
however, become more appealing to terrorists if the 
capabilities of these agencies continue to be eroded by the 
country,s steep economic decline. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
INFORMATION ON FOREIGN GOVERNMENT COOPERATION 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Although the GOZ has not been requested to 
cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of any 
terrorist act within the past five years, there exist no 
known impediments to host government prosecution and/or 
extradition of suspected terrorists. 
 
¶6. (U) Post,s terrorism reporting officer is Political 
Officer Bianca Menendez.  Her telephone number is (263) (4) 
250-593 ext 291 and email addresses are menendezbe@state.gov 
(unclassified) and menendezbe@state.sgov.gov (classified).
