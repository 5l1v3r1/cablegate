AFRICA AND MOZAMBIQUE 
 
REF: STATE 42016 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  President Mwanawasa extolled South Africa 
and Mozambique for refusing to offload a Chinese arms 
shipment headed to Zimbabwe and called on other countries to 
do likewise.  He dismissed comments by a ruling party member, 
George Chumbwe, recommending the violent overthrow of Mugabe. 
 The tide of Zambian public opinion is turning against 
Mugabe, thanks in part to Mwanawasa's bold statements as well 
as the Zimbabwean electoral impasse, which has shed light on 
Mugabe's human rights abuses.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On April 21, President Mwanawasa publicly praised 
South Africa and Mozambique for refusing to offload the 
Chinese arms shipment headed to Zimbabwe (Reftel).  He 
expressed hope that other countries follow South Africa's and 
Mozambique's lead, saying that "we don't want (to) escalate 
the situation in Zimbabwe."  In an unusually pointed remark, 
Mwanawasa suggested that "the Chinese can play a very useful 
role in Zimbabwe without the use of firearms." 
 
¶3. (U) Mwanawasa also expressed regret for the statements of 
a member of the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) 
ruling party, Geoffrey Chumbwe, who called for the violent 
overthrow of President Mugabe.  Mwanawasa described the 
comments by the Lusaka Province MMD Chair as "irresponsible." 
He pointed to dialogue as the only answer to the crisis in 
Zimbabwe, as he distanced himself and the MMD party from 
Chumbwe's remarks. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Chumbwe's comments, however, add to the chorus of 
disapproval and public criticism of Mugabe in Zambia.  Even 
opposition party leader and former presidential candidate 
Michael Sata joined the refrain when he stated on April 16 
that the "crisis" in Zimbabwe is an "eye-opener" to all 
African leaders and sheds light on Africa's problems.  These 
words came as a surprise to many, given Sata's affiliation to 
Mugabe and his one-time intention to invite Mugabe to be his 
guest of honor in the event of his victory in the 2006 
presidential elections. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment.  Mwanawasa, through his leadership in SADC, 
has helped open the discussion on Zimbabwe, demonstrating by 
his own example that Zimbabwe's crisis is an internal African 
problem and no longer "taboo."  Mwanwasa's response to the 
electoral impasse in Zimbabwe appears to be turning the tide 
of Zambian public opinion against Mugabe.  Many Zambians seem 
to have reframed their perspective on Zimbabwe's problems, 
looking beyond its economic woes (and land reform issues), to 
broader issues of human right abuse, poor governance, and 
disregard for democracy.
