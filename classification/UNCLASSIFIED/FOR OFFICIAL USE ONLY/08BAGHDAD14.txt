SUBJECT:  AUSTRALIA CONSIDERS NEW ASSISTANCE INITIATIVES FOR IRAQ 
 
REF:  BAGHDAD 4163 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Australian Ambassador Innes Brown called on EMIN 
December 28 to discuss possible areas where Australia could increase 
its economic assistance to Iraq.  The Government of Australia (GoA) 
has been tasked by PM Rudd to develop new initiatives by the end of 
January.  Innes Brown said that Australia is not interested in 
further contributions to the UN-World Bank led IRFFI.  Australia may 
be willing to support projects - including co-financing with us or 
other bilateral donors -- in the fields of health and agriculture 
(particularly dry land agriculture), as well as training in third 
countries.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) EMIN met December 28 with Australian Ambassador to Iraq Mark 
Innes Brown to discuss economic and assistance opportunities in 
Iraq.  Ambassador Innes Brown said that following his visit to 
Baghdad (reftel), Australian PM Rudd had asked the Cabinet to 
examine ways for Australia to do more in economic assistance in Iraq 
as it withdraws forces.  The enhanced assistance plan is to be 
completed by the end of January. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) Innes Brown said the GoA had an unhappy experience with 
its contributions to IRFFI.  Much of the money was chewed up in high 
UN system overhead charges and there was little transparency or 
recognition of the contributions.  Thus a presumption behind the 
review is that if Australia does something new for Iraq it will be 
either of a bilateral character or co-financed with another donor. 
 
 
¶4.  (U) Innes Brown suggested that the GoA is most interested in 
projects in the fields of health and agriculture, and perhaps some 
offshore capacity development training, perhaps focused on the 
Council of Representatives (CoR).  He said he anticipated that the 
GoA would be happy to contribute to "good projects that someone else 
manages" as long as there is recognition for Australia. 
 
¶5.  (U) On health, Ambassador Innes Brown was interested in the 
possibility of supporting training for basic health care 
professionals who would work in primary health centers (the U.S. is 
completing a network of 140 PHC's built with IRRF funds).   EMIN 
noted the U.S. is starting such a project and would arrange for HHS 
Attache Himmler to provide more details.  Ambassador Innes Brown 
seemed most interested in finding a discrete aspect of this program 
the Australians could cite as their own, even if managed Qhe U.S. 
implementing partner.  Specialized training delivered off-shore 
might be such a possibility, since the U.S. intends to deliver basic 
training in-country. 
 
¶6.  (U) The agriculture sector seemed to offer another possibility. 
Australia provides assistance to the International Center for 
Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) in Aleppo, Syria. 
Ambassador Innes Brown said that ICARDA is piloting some drought 
resistant strains of wheat and barley in Ninewa and Tamim this year. 
 The GoA may want to support more of this work.  Ambassador Innes 
Brown said there were no IPR restrictions on the seedlines developed 
by ICARDA, as it is Qember of the ConsuQtive Group on 
International Agricultural Research.   He added that the GoA had 
already decided to support 100 one-year long research fellowships 
for agricultural scientists in Australia.  As Australia also has dry 
land agricultural challenges, they think this is a good fit for 
Iraq, and similar to other long-term training funded by Australia in 
the past. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Finally, Ambassador Innes Brown said the GoA may be 
interested in doing something additional in the field of ministerial 
capacity, probably also involving offshore training.  The Australian 
Embassy has already agreed with CoR Speaker Mashadani to send a CoR 
delegation to Canberra in the summer, focused on issues of 
federal/state financing.  The logic is that since Australia has a 
parliamentary system in a federal structure, they have something to 
offer here. 
 
¶8.  (U) EMIN tried to interest Ambassador Innes Brown in cooperating 
on other ongoing U.S. assistance programs, including small and 
medium sized enterprise credit programs,  but found little immediate 
take-up for those ideas.
