¶1. (SBU) On April 7, the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), which up 
until now had urged Egyptians to participate in the April 8 
local council elections, called on voters to boycott.  The 
full text of the MB's statement is posted on the 
organization's website (translated text at para 3).  The MB's 
Deputy Supreme Guide, Mohamed Habib, separately announced 
that the organization is withdrawing its 20 candidates from 
the election.  According to leading MB member Essam El Erian, 
out of 10,000 MB candidates that originally planned to 
contest the elections, only 498 were able to register, and 
only 20 of those actually appeared on the official candidate 
lists, issued following a lengthy government review (ref D). 
The MB reportedly filed 3,192 lawsuits demanding that its 
candidates be reinstated on the ballots, and has thus far won 
2,664 of the cases, but the government has ignored the court 
orders. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The MB's boycott is likely to further decrease the 
already low voter turnout anticipated for April 8.  Many 
Egyptians we have spoken to are still unaware, only one day 
before the elections, that balloting is due to take place. 
Even ruling party contacts have told us that, at this point, 
the elections are largely "for show." 
 
¶3. (U) Full text of MB statement: 
 
In the name of God 
 
A Statement by the Muslim Brotherhood Regarding Its Final 
Position on the Local Elections 
 
The Egyptian regime has dealt with the local council 
elections in a manner that alienated all effective and active 
forces in Egyptian society, with the MB at the heart of them. 
 The regime engaged in a variety of obstructionist methods, 
from barring the nominations of candidates and arresting over 
900 members of the MB, to ignoring court decisions that 
ordered the names of excluded candidates to be put on the 
ballot and the elections in several governorates halted. 
 
Based on the above, we would like to reiterate the following: 
 
Firstly, we will continue to struggle politically and legally 
until we annul the results of the local elections, if indeed 
they are held. 
 
Secondly, we call on the Egyptian people to boycott the 
elections tomorrow, out of respect for the legitimate 
judicial rulings that have been flagrantly ignored and 
disrespected by the government. 
 
Thirdly, we will continue to stand up to totalitarianism and 
corruption, and peacefully pursue reform and change through 
constitutional and legal channels, in a way that achieves the 
renaissance of our homeland, and the advancement of our 
nation. 
 
We are deeply grateful to the MB members who have sacrificed 
and remained persistent, as they are fulfilling God's will, 
and achieving the interests of the Egyptian people and our 
homeland.  We also thank the masses of our beloved supporters 
who have buoyed us through all of these ordeals and crises. 
 
End statement.
