SUBJECT: SWISS RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR DONATIONS TO UNRWA'S 
GAZA FLASH APPEAL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 135559 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel message on January 5 to 
Thomas Oertle, Desk Officer for Israeli-Palestinian affairs 
in the Middle East and Africa Division of the Swiss 
Department of Foreign Affairs (EDA).  Oertle explained that 
Switzerland already was providing CHF 4 million (USD 3.8 
million) in financial support for humanitarian aid to the 
civilian population of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.  He 
noted that these funds were divided equally between the 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian 
Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Oertle further clarified that, of the CHF 4 million 
in Swiss funding, the CHF 2 million (USD 1.9 million) for 
UNRWA was earmarked for UNWRA's Emergency Appeal under the 
2009 Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP), not for UNRWA's 
recent Flash Appeal.  He remarked that the Emergency Appeal 
was "chronically underfunded."  With reference to the Flash 
Appeal, Oertle said that the EDA, and specifically the Swiss 
Development and Cooperation Agency (SDC), was still 
evaluating the possibility of increasing its contributions to 
UNRWA.  He noted, however, that any such increase likely 
would be within the framework of the regular UNRWA Emergency 
Appeal.
