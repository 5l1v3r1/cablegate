REF: A. SECSTATE 74417 
 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 75287 
 
¶1. (SBU) Following the President's new proposal on climate 
change, Econoff briefed Outi Berghall, Director of the 
International Climate Change Project at the Finnish Ministry 
of Environment and Vice Chair of the Kyoto Ad Hoc Working 
Group (AWG) on Further Commitments, as well as key contacts 
at the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  Finnish 
government contacts welcomed the President's climate 
proposal, stating it would greatly strengthen international 
resolve to address climate change.  Berghall was especially 
intrigued by the Bush Administration,s plan to promote 
funding for climate-friendly initiatives in developing 
countries.  Berghall plans to brief Environment Minister 
Paula Lehtomaki on this "significant announcement" soon; 
Lehtomaki sits on the GOF,s Climate and Energy Security 
Ministerial Committee.  MFA contacts added that U.S. 
leadership in addressing the challenges of climate change is 
perfect timing and that the message should be well received 
during the up-coming G8 meetings. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Berghall, EU Energy Commissioner Andris 
Piebalgs, while speaking at an energy seminar in Helsinki on 
June 1, said the Bush Administration proposal was "the most 
important news this year" related to climate change.  He 
continued by stating the proposal has already generated a 
great deal of interest in the EU, and he expects this 
proposal to be a starting point for additional international 
cooperation. 
 
¶3. (U) Thus far Finnish press coverage on the new proposal 
has been light.  Under the leadership of Ambassador Ware, 
Embassy Helsinki plans to engage additional high ranking 
government and media contacts to build Finnish public and 
governmental support for the President's climate change 
proposal.  Traditionally the GOF has been a strong European 
advocate for addressing climate change by pushing energy 
efficiency and clean energy technology.
