AGREEMENT CLOSE TO CONCLUSION 
 
REF: 2010 BRASILIA 60 
 
(U)  THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR INTERNET 
DISTRIBUTION. 
 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On January 29 negotiators from the Brazilian Finance 
(Fazenda), Ministry of External Relations (MRE), and the Ministry 
of the Environment (MMA) met via digital videoconference with 
representatives from the U.S. Department of State, Treasury 
Department and USAID to finalize the text of the Tropical Forest 
Conservation Act Agreement (TFCA) between the two countries. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) The tone of the discussions was positive and reflected a 
strong commitment on both sides to conclude this agreement.  See 
reftel about Brazil's high-level interest in establishing a TFCA 
program.  The two sides were able to agree upon text that addressed 
the majority of their differences, though they did identify a few, 
largely technical, differences that have yet to be resolved.  The 
U.S. side stressed the importance of timing in regard to completing 
the agreement and requested that the Brazilians provide additional 
information on a timeframe for Brazilian Senate consideration and 
approval of the agreement. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Both sides agreed on a series of next steps to, each of 
which was assigned to one of the two delegations.  In conversations 
with Science Officer after the videoconference, Brazilian 
counterparts stressed that establishing a TFCA program is important 
and that they felt the few remaining differences were resolvable. 
The Brazilian side hopes to complete its action items within a 
week. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On February 2, the lead negotiator from the Finance 
Ministry, Fabiola Saldanha, an attorney in the Office of General 
Coordination for Financial Operations, informed the Embassy that 
the Brazilian side believes the remaining details can be resolved 
swiftly.  She thought the TFCA agreement should be ready to send to 
the Brazilian Senate for approval shortly, which should coincide 
with the Senate returning to session in March.  On the question of 
when the Senate would be likely to approve the agreement, she did 
not want to add anything to what she had said in the 
videoconference, (i.e. an expectation of passage by June or July.) 
She noted that the Finance Ministry works daily with these types of 
contracts and their experience clearly demonstrates a lack of a 
pattern.  However, she confirmed that the Brazilian side could work 
with the key Senators and "with this we expect a rapid approval." 
Further, she reaffirmed that while the Senate theoretically can 
modify the text of agreements sent to it for approval, it does not 
do so as a practical matter.
