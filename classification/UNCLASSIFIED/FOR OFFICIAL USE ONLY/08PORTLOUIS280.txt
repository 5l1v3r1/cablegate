¶1. (SBU) On August 1, Ambassador Cabrera, accompanied by DCM 
as notetaker, delivered reftel demarche to Secretary of 
Foreign Affairs, Anund Neewoor.  Neewoor acknowledged the 
demarche points and suggested that the framework for talks 
between Mugabe's ZANU-PF party and the opposition Movement 
for Democratic Change is a positive step towards a 
resolution.  Neewoor added that Mauritius is "on the same 
wave length" as the United States, noting in particular that 
Mauritius would like to see Mugabe out either via new 
elections or via negotiations.  A dignified departure of 
Mugabe from power would be "the best for Zimbabwe, Africa and 
the world." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Secretary Neewoor noted the recent talks as evidence 
that the "quiet diplomacy" of the SADC designated 
facilitator, President Thabo Mbeki, is working. According to 
Neewoor, these recent talks vindicated the GOM's long-held 
stance of making no independent commentary on Zimbabwe. 
 
¶3. (SBU) When asked for information on what GOM plans to do 
to support the current process, Neewoor only noted the GOM's 
support for the inclusion of Zimbabwe on the agenda for the 
upcoming August 15 SADC summit in South Africa. He added, 
however, that he anticipates a "breakthrough" in negotiations 
prior to the summit which could preclude the need to raise it 
in SADC.
