¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Pol/Econ Chief discussed reftel 
points on GAERC agenda items with Kristina Meius, the 
MFA's European Correspondent, on October 16.  Meius 
provided feedback on the following issues: 
 
¶2. (SBU) Iran:  The GOE is concerned about recent 
statements coming from Iran and supports an active role 
for the UN in resolving this crisis.  While the 
International community should not hurry towards 
sanctions, continued postponement will diminish the 
effectiveness of Security Council decisions.  The 
international community must send a message to Iran that 
it comply with its obligations and that its efforts to 
split the international community will not be 
successful. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Middle East Peace Process:  The GOE is 
concerned about recent clashes between Fatah and Hamas 
as well as President Abbas' statement that dialogue with 
Hamas has been suspended.  The GOE believes that a 
lasting resolution can only be reached via political 
dialogue and implementation of the Roadmap.  A military 
solution will not bring the desired results.  The GOE 
believes that extension of TIM was a good decision and 
that the Palestinian Authority must fulfill the 
conditions necessary for international cooperation. With 
respect to Lebanon, the GOE believes that UNSCR 1701 is 
an important precondition for maintaining peace in the 
region. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Sudan:  The GOE is concerned about the 
deterioration of the situation in Sudan; the level of 
violence has reached a critical level.  Active 
diplomatic action is necessary in order to ensure the 
Government of Sudan meets UNSCR 1706.  In order to 
influence Sudan, contacts with key countries should be 
used and a strong message from the U.S., Russia, and 
China is important.  The GOE supports extending EU 
civilian/military support to AMIS through the end of the 
year. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Zimbabwe:  The GOE is concerned about the 
deterioration of the economic and social conditions in 
Zimbabwe and the resultant humanitarian crisis.  This is 
impacting neighboring countries and slowing economic 
growth in the region.  The EU is the main donor in 
Zimbabwe and its role in finding a solution to the 
problem is extremely important. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Western Balkans:  The GOE believes the 
parliamentary elections in Bosnia went well and were 
conducted in accordance with international standards. 
The Government of Bosnia needs to continue its efforts 
on constitutional and police reforms that will allow 
them to finalize Stabilization and Association Agreement 
(SAA) negotiations with the EU.  The GOE supports 
Ahtisaari and his conduct of the political process in 
determining Kosovo's future status and welcomes and 
supports planning underway for an ESDP mission to 
Kosovo.  With respect to Serbia, the GOE believes 
Serbian integration with the EU is extremely important 
and calls on Serbia to continue the necessary reforms 
including cooperation with ICTY. 
 
¶7. Georgia: FM Paet is likely to take an active role in 
the lunch discussion on Georgia.  The GOE supports the 
actions of the Troika and believes that Russia clearly 
over-reacted and aggravated the situation.  The EU 
should insist to Russia that force or the threat of 
force is unacceptable and that Russian military forces 
in Georgia and on the border with Georgia must return 
from "operational readiness" back to normal status.  The 
EU must require Russia to end the blockade of Georgia, 
and activities directed at Georgia, including repression 
of Georgians in Russia, and call on Russia to restore 
normal diplomatic communications with Georgia.  On the 
other hand, Georgia must refrain from behaving in ways 
that provoke Russia.  The GOE believes the EU should be 
prepared to provide financial support to help Georgia if 
Russia establishes a total blockade (i.e. energy). 
 
¶8. (SBU) North Korea:  The GOE condemns North Korea's 
nuclear test which jeopardizes regional peace and 
security.  North Korea must fully implement the non- 
proliferation treaty and UNSCR 1695 and return to the 
Six Party Talks.
