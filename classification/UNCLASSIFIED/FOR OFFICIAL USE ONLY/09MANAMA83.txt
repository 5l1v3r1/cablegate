¶1.  (U) Bahraini prosecutors announced to media February 5 
that they would appeal to increase the 1-year sentence handed 
down the previous day against convicted Sunni terrorist 
financier Adel Saleh (ref A). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) CDA expressed concern with the light sentence to FM 
Khalid bin Ahmad February 10.  Shaikh Khalid agreed that a 
heavier penalty was needed if Bahrain was to deter 
extremists.  Similarly, Chief Prosecutor Nawaf Al Mouada told 
A/DCM February 12 the judges' decision was "disappointing" 
and the GOB wanted "a much stronger sentence."  Al Mouada 
believed the prosecution could make a good case on appeal for 
a longer sentence, but would not speculate on the outcome.
