SUBJECT: ONE UN PROGRAM IN RWANDA 
 
REF: STATE 43368 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The One UN program in Rwanda has taken its first 
organizational steps.  On February 27 and 28, the UN 
organized a retreat, the first day consisting of UN agencies 
in Rwanda discussing the prospective program, and the second 
day including donor governments and Rwandan officials.  A 
resulting Concept Paper, "One UN Delivering as One in 
Rwanda," was signed by representatives of the various UN 
agencies resident in Rwanda, as well as representatives of 
non-resident agencies with current programs here (copy of 
Concept Paper will be e-mailed to Department and USUN). Note: 
there are 10 agencies resident at post, four agencies with 
in-country presence through UNDP, and four non-resident 
agencies. MONUC and ICTR are not participating in this 
effort. End note. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Much of what is proposed appears to be 
non-controversial -- a clearly defined role for the UN 
Resident Coordinator as the leader of UN programming efforts, 
the pooling of administrative functions, the erection of a 
common compound for all agencies to move into, increased 
donor coordination, and the alignment of individual agency 
efforts not only with the existing UN Development Assistance 
Framework, but also with the GOR's Economic Development and 
Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS), presently still under 
discussion. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On the subject of individual agency budgets and the 
prospect for pooled resources, at least initially the Concept 
Paper envisions a One Budgetary Framework that leaves "core 
budgets" within the control of each UN agency.  A 
supplemental Pooled Fund, set with close coordination with 
donors, will be used to "create incentives for agencies to 
work within the One UN program." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In a discussion with representatives from other 
donors in Rwanda, several expressed to embassy officers 
strong support for the UN effort, particularly on efficiency 
grounds.  Dutch and DFID personnel focused on potential gains 
to be realized through reduced transactions costs and reduced 
overlap of agency responsibility, including the potential for 
some UN agencies to cede program responsibility to other UN 
entities and leave Rwanda.
