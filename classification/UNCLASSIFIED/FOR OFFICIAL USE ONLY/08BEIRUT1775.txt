USG CASH TRANSFER: 
GAS EXCISE TAX REFORM ACHIEVABLE? 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a December 18 meeting with NEA DAS Hale and the 
Ambassador, Finance Minister Mohammad Chatah said he may want to 
retain the imposition of a gasoline excise tax as a condition for 
the disbursement of USG budget support pledged at Paris III, instead 
of replacing it with a reform of electricity tariffs.  With the 
falling price of oil, said Chatah, the gasoline tax stands, on the 
current sliding scale, at approximately 450 Lebanese pounds (about 
30 cents) per liter -- well over the 300 Lebanese pounds per liter 
demanded under the U.S. condition.  He noted fixing the tax 
permanently at 300 or 350 pounds would be politically 
uncontroversial, as the move would amount to a lowering of the 
current tax.  Chatah is trying to put the gas excise tax on the 
cabinet's agenda so it can be approved in the coming weeks. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Meanwhile, Chatah noted that Energy Minister Alain 
Tabourian was facing political pressure not to alter the electricity 
tariff structure, the reform of which Tabourian had placed at the 
center of his ministerial mandate.  Tabourian issued a statement 
December 19 saying lower energy prices had obviated the need for 
tariff reform.  Chatah suggested the Prime Minister could reduce 
political pressure on Tabourian by asking him to submit various 
tariff plans; the cabinet, voting as a whole, would provide cover 
for Tabourian.  Chatah, while acknowledging reform was still 
possible, assessed the current political climate might provide more 
challenges than expected.  Therefore, he preferred to wait before 
agreeing to the change in USG conditionality. 
 
MOBILE PRIVATIZATION 
POSTPONED 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) English newspaper The Daily Star reported on December 17 that 
PM Siniora confirmed the GOL will postpone the privatization of two 
state-owned mobile phone companies because of global market 
conditions.  In the meantime, the GOL has decreed "pressing reforms 
in the sector," Siniora said. 
 
SALARY INCREASES PRESSURE 
STATE FINANCES 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) On December 15, parliament approved legislation raising the 
minimum wage and across the board public sector salary increase. 
(Note: Cabinet had approved the measure on September 9.  End Note.) 
Parliament also approved a five percent salary increase and the 
settlement of salary arrears for civil servants and retirees for the 
period 1996-1998.  These measures will put substantial pressure on 
state finances and further exacerbate the already huge budget 
deficit.  In addition, MPs voted to raise rent charges -- pegged by 
law to the minimum wage -- by 33 percent. 
 
EU TEAM ASSESSING 
TRADE ASSISTANCE NEEDS 
-------------------- 
 
 
BEIRUT 00001775  002 OF 003 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) EconOff met December 15 with an EU team contracted to 
determine Lebanon's trade assistance needs in preparation for a 2010 
EU assistance program.  EconOff briefed the assessment team on the 
progress of USAID and MEPI's 8-year WTO accession program at the 
Ministry of Economy and Trade (MOET), as well as other USG programs 
aimed at private sector development.  EU contactors are anxious to 
coordinate their upcoming assistance program with USAID as it rebids 
the contract for the MOET WTO project. 
 
GOL SEEKS FOREIGN ASSISTANCE 
FOR WATER PROJECTS 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) On December 16, the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), in 
collaboration with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 
invited representatives of potential donor countries to a conference 
seeking technical assistance and financing for three water projects. 
 According to Minister of Energy and Water Alain Tabourian, Lebanon 
will suffer from water shortage by 2020. USAID has been involved in 
helping MEW strengthen the institution capacity of its water 
establishments. 
 
NEW NATIONAL ACCOUNTS SHOW 
7.5 PERCENT REAL GROWTH IN 2007 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) At the December 15 release of the 2006-2007 national 
accounts, PM Siniora said that real growth reached 7.5 percent in 
¶2007.  He added Lebanon can record higher growth if the economy 
remains separate from domestic political tensions.  A senior contact 
at Audi Bank acknowledged the figure -- much higher than Central 
Bank of Lebanon and IMF estimates -- was slightly optimistic given 
the domestic political and security conditions in 2007. 
Nevertheless, the bank will adopt the official figure in its 
economic reports, he said. 
 
2008 REMITTANCES TOTAL $6 BILLION 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) The World Bank (WB) estimated remittance inflows to Lebanon 
in 2008 will reach $6 billion, or a four percent increase compared 
to 2007.  Lebanon ranked 18 worldwide and third out of 12 MENA 
countries in terms of value of remittances.  The report estimted 
remittances to Lebanon equaled 24.4 percent f GDP in 2007, the 
fifth highest ratio in the wold.  Remittances from the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, accounting for 26 percent of 
flows to MENA countries in 2008, are expected to decrease in 2009 
with the continued drop in oil prices and the effects of the global 
financial crisis. 
 
AUDI BANK WANTS EXPANDED 
OPIC RELATIONSHIP 
-------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Audi Bank has fully drawn $100 million in Overseas Private 
Investment Corporation (OPIC) credit line guarantee (covering 15 
years) arranged through Citibank, and has started extending loans 
locally to SMEs, housing, and retail, Audi Bank Senior Manager 
Khalil Geagea told us December 15.  He said although the OPIC 
agreement is also open for lending in Jordan and Egypt, Audi Bank 
plans to ask OPIC for a stand-alone program for Egypt given the size 
of the Egyptian economy.  Audi Bank Head of Regional Expansion Elia 
Samaha plans to meet in January 2009 with OPIC officials in 
Washington, D.C., to follow up on the potential Egypt program. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Geagea said Audi Bank also has credit line agreements with 
the European Investment Bank (EIB, 60 ml Euros) and the French 
Development Agency (USAID counterpart; 25 ml euros) for lending to 
SMEs in Lebanon.  Geagea was in Egypt December 16-18 to discuss a 
stand-alone facility for Egypt with both EIB and AFD.  He said EIB 
expressed interest in doing business in Jordan with Audi 
Bank-Jordan.  Geagea noted that while OPIC loans are easier to use 
and more flexible in terms of administrative procedures, follow-up, 
and reporting, EIB and AFD loans are cheaper. 
 
NEW AUCTION FOR CELLULAR VANITY 
NUMBERS TO RAISE REVENUES 
-------------------- 
 
 
BEIRUT 00001775  003 OF 003 
 
 
¶11. (U) Minister of Telecommunications Gebran Bassil announced 
December 15 that Alpha, the cellular company currently managed by 
the ministry, will auction 50 vanity numbers on December 22 to bring 
additional revenues to the Treasury.  Last October, the Ministry of 
Telecommunications collected $2.5 million from the auction of 30 
vanity numbers. 
 
FRENCH CONFERENCE ON EU-ARAB 
RELATIONS IN DAMASCUS 
-------------------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) Prominent economist Dr. Kamal Hamdan December 17 told us 
he will participate in a conference December 19-20 in Damascus to 
discuss EU-Arab Near East political, economic, social, and cultural 
relations.  The event, co-organized by the French Embassy in 
Damascus, falls within the EU's Union for the Mediterranean 
initiative and occurs, Hamden assessed, within the context of 
reviving French-Syrian relations.  Hamdan said about 20 experts have 
been invited to attend, including head of Carnegie Middle East Dr. 
Paul Salem, Syrian intellectuals, and about ten French experts. 
 
MEA FLIGHTS TO IRAQ 
TO RESUME JUNE 2009 
------------------- 
 
¶13. (U) Minister of Transportation and Public Works Ghazi Aridi 
signed December 18 a MOU on air traffic between Lebanon and Iraq. 
The MOU calls for the resumption of national passenger carrier MEA 
flights to Iraq starting June 14, 2009, with up to 14 flights a 
week.  MEA Chairman Mohammad Hout told us that MEA will first start 
serving Baghdad Airport; he plans to visit Iraq in late 
January/early February with auditors to check on Baghdad airport 
facilities, and security and safety arrangements.  MEA suspended 
flights to Iraq in 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
