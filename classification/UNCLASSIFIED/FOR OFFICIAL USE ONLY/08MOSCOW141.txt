SUBJECT: RUSSIAN SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND INVESTMENT RULES, PART I 
 
 
¶1.  (U) On January 9, Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov signed a 
government resolution that sets the investment parameters for part 
of the country's sovereign wealth fund.  On February 1, the GOR will 
divide the current Oil Stabilization Fund into two parts: the 
Reserve Fund and the National Prosperity Fund.  As of January 1, the 
Stabilization Fund reached RRub 3.85 trillion (USD 157 billion), 
exceeding the Finance Ministry's December estimate that the Fund 
would grow to RRub 3.8 trillion (USD 155 billion) by February 1. 
 
¶2.  (U) The January 9 resolution outlines the investment types and 
limits affecting the disposition of Reserve Fund assets.  The 
investment categories are: 
 
--Foreign-currency, interest-bearing accounts at the Central Bank 
(CBR); 
--Sovereign bonds of 14 developed countries (including the U.S., 
U.K., Canada and some European countries), whic will account for a 
minimum of 50 percent of Reserve Fund assets; 
--Bonds of foreign government agencies, which will account for a 
maximum of 30 percent of assets; 
--Bonds of 8 selected international financial institutions will 
account for a maximum of 15 percent of assets; and 
--Deposits in foreign credit institutions, which will account for a 
maximum of 30 percent of assets. 
 
¶2.  (U) Eligible bonds will be denominated in US dollars, euros, or 
British pounds sterling with fixed maturities and coupon rates and 
be non-callable.  The resolution requires the issuer to have a 
long-term credit rating of at least AA- on the S&P and Fitch-Ratings 
scales, and Aa3 on Moody's.  Reserve Fund managers will need to 
purchase publicly traded bonds in lots not less than USD 1 billion, 
Euros 1 billion or BrP 500 million.  The rules also prohibit 
purchasing any single bond issue whose nominal value exceeds 15 
percent of the Reserve Fund's total bond holdings.  In similar 
fashion, no single bank deposit may exceed 25 percent of total 
Reserve Fund assets invested in foreign bank deposits. 
 
¶3.  (U) The rules for Reserve Fund assets management appear to be 
almost as conservative as the rules for Stabilization Fund 
management.  For example, Stabilization Fund rules stipulated that a 
sovereign bond issuer needed the top rating from all major credit 
rating agencies for the obligation to be eligible as an investment 
instrument.  The rules for investing National Prosperity Fund assets 
remain pending but are expected to allow investment in corporate 
securities.
