SUBJECT: FY2008 SUMMARY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING BY 
AMCONGEN HONG KONG 
 
¶1. (SBU) Law enforcement cooperation and capacity building 
are top priorities in Post's Mission Strategic Plan.  To this 
end, during FY 2008, USG security officials stationed at 
AmConGen Hong Kong organized and/or funded training programs 
for 69 police officers, 79 customs officials, and five other 
law enforcement personnel from Hong Kong and Macau.  A total 
of 136 Hong Kong and 17 Macau law enforcement officials 
participated in these programs.  Of the customs officials, 68 
officials at Hong Kong's port received Secure Freight 
Initiative (SFI) operator training from Sandia Labs under the 
sponsorship of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.  Other 
training courses for Hong Kong and Macau police, customs and 
other government officials included crime scene 
investigations, computer and financial crime investigations, 
and leadership development, among other course topics.  Most 
of those courses were conducted at ILEA, Bangkok. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Acting within their regional area of operations, 
U.S. Secret Service (USSS) personnel at the Consulate General 
also provided counterfeit currency detection training to 150 
Taiwan airport police and customs officials in Taipei.  USSS 
provided a similar multi-day training program to 125 
employees of China Construction Bank in Harbin, China.  In 
addition, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration personnel 
stationed in Hong Kong provided asset forfeiture training to 
40 Taiwan police, customs, coast guard and justice ministry 
officials. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In total, USG personnel stationed at AmConGen Hong 
Kong provided law enforcement-related training to 468 
individuals during FY2008, including 190 from Taiwan and 125 
from mainland China.  This does not include numerous 
conference and seminar speaking engagements for USG personnel 
assigned to the Consulate. 
 
¶4. (SBU) FY2009 training courses for Hong Kong and Macau law 
enforcement personnel have thus far included topics similar 
to those listed previously, as well as courses covering 
strategic commodity transfers and proliferation awareness.
