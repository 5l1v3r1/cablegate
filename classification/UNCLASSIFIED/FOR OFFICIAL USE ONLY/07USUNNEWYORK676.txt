SUBJECT: READ-OUT OF MEETINGS WITH SYG BAN ON DARFUR 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  In an August 14 meeting with Ambassador Khalilzad, 
Secretary-General (SYG) Ban Ki-moon discussed his upcoming 
 
SIPDIS 
September 2-4 visit to Sudan, which would also include stops 
in Chad and Libya.  The SYG hoped by the time of his trip, 
United Nations (UN) Special Envoy Eliasson and African Union 
(AU) Special Envoy Salim would be able to recommend convening 
an AU-UN-hosted "peace conference" of all parties to the 
Darfur conflict.  SYG Ban solicited U.S. and UN Security 
Council (UNSC) help in convincing Sudan Liberation Movement 
faction leader Abdelwahid to participate in the peace process. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SYG Ban was critical of recent press statements by 
AU Commission Chairperson Konare about the composition of the 
UN-AU Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), agreeing with Ambassador 
Khalilzad and with UNSC Members during his monthly luncheon 
with the UNSC (also held on August 14) that "African 
character" did not equal "African-only."  South Africa was 
vocal in supporting this assertion and urged the SYG to make 
a statement about the UN's lead in UNAMID command and control. 
 
¶3. (SBU) SYG Ban was positive following phone conversations 
with President Bashir.  On the issue of the vacant post of 
Special Representative for the UN Mission in the Sudan 
(UNMIS), the SYG reported to Ambassador Khalilzad that the 
Sudanese Government had not yet responded to the suggestion 
of Ashraf Qazi for this post.  The SYG was concerned that to 
replace Qazi in Iraq without on onward assignment would 
constitute a "loss of face" for Qazi. 
 
¶4. (SBU) During the August 14 SYG luncheon, Ambassador 
Khalilzad stressed the need for observation of Darfur 
benchmarks in order to provide the UNSC with ammunition to 
use its influence as necessary if the Darfur processes got 
off track.  The Chinese Permanent Representative argued that 
political progress in Darfur was the most important issue, 
but Ambassador Khalilzad stressed that the 
military/peacekeeping track was necessary in the short-term 
to ensure meeting the long-term goal of political 
reconciliation.
