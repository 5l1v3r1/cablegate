¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: In an address delivered 27 January at 
Chatham House, just prior to the London Conference on 
Afghanistan, Foreign Minister Stubb prescribed a bit of 
marriage counseling for the EU-U.S. axis of the 
transatlantic relationship.  Describing the relationship as 
akin to "a grumpy old couple" who are not quite sure how 
the relationship will play out in a changing world, Stubb 
repeated the view shared in political circles in Helsinki 
that American attention is increasingly diverted 
elsewhere.  While the EU-U.S. relationship has rarely been 
as good as it is at present, crises and opportunities in 
Asia are increasingly leading to a dangerous drift in 
relations.  As a prescription, Stubb called for a "marriage 
council" of experts to consider concrete measures that would 
deepen 
and strengthen transatlantic cooperation. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------- 
SHARED HISTORY NOT ENOUGH 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) A confirmed Atlanticist who has worked and studied 
in the U.S., FM Stubb began his 27 January speech, entitled 
"The New Atlantic Decade", by noting the economic strength 
of the "Atlantic community", with its creative, inclusive 
societies that drive global standards in both business and 
government.  The depth and scope of EU-U.S. cooperation are 
"astounding," yet there is unease on both sides of the 
Atlantic.  Stubb sees a U.S. "flirting with the world 
outside Europe and assessing its global network of 
partnerships" while Americans evince increasing frustration 
with the "weak and politically divided European Union." 
Europeans for their part fear a decline in their global 
position relative to emerging economies; "We are afraid of 
a G2 world dominated by the U.S. and China," admitted 
Stubb.  (NOTE: As an example, he cites the failure of the 
U.S. and EU to agree on a common approach at Copenhagen. 
Similarly, at a recent Helsinki seminar former Finnish PM 
Paavo Lipponen seized on the same theme, decrying the 
exclusion of the EU from the final negotiation of the 
Copenhagen Accord.  END NOTE.)  Stubb's conclusion is that, 
while the relationship is strong, "we do not know how to 
use it to shape the world around us", a world composed of a 
greater number of actors with more divergent values and 
multiplying challenges such as climate change, fragile 
states, economic and financial governance, etc. 
 
-------------------------- 
TIME FOR A NEW PARTNERSHIP 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Stubb suggested that changes on both sides of the 
Atlantic are making a new kind of partnership possible. 
The post-Lisbon EU will have a more unified and active 
foreign policy, which Stubb sees as being matched with a 
new "willingness in Europe to take on more global 
responsibilities, as has been the case with climate 
change."  On the U.S. side, the Obama administration's "new 
pragmatism and openness" and a foreign policy driven by the 
three Ds of diplomacy, development, and defense open the 
way for effective multilateralism.  (NOTE: Finland's own 
rhetoric on the "comprehensive approach" to crisis 
management, which they will make the theme of a seminar on 
the 
NATO strategic concept in March, matches up well with the 
"three Ds".  END NOTE.)  In sum, these changes make 
possible an EU-U.S. partnership that can set common goals 
on global issues, agree on coordinated measures to achieve 
them, and lead other global players to support them. 
 
------------------ 
CONCRETE PROPOSALS 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Taking inspiration from the NATO Strategic Concept 
review, Stubb offered that the U.. and EU should also 
conduct a "joint stock-taking."  (NOTE: At a lunch with EU 
chiefs of mission in Helsinki earlier in January, Stubb 
previewed this idea, suggesting that Ashton and Clinton 
lead the review.  END NOTE.)  To help kick-start the 
process, he suggested several ideas to strengthen the 
partnership: 
 
-- Solidarity Pledge: A Lisbon-style pledge of solidarity 
in the case of civilian crises such as terrorist attacks or 
natural or man-made disasters.  This would be a complement 
 
HELSINKI 00000049  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
to NATO commitments and would signal a "qualitative change" 
in the relationship. 
 
-- Transatlantic Green Economy: Existing institutions such 
as the Transatlantic Economic Council and Transatlantic 
Energy Council need to be used to achieve tangible results 
in leading the globe towards a low-carbon economy. 
 
-- Full-fledged Free Trade Area: According to Stubb, it is 
"time to put our money where our mouth is." 
 
-- Open Transatlantic Cooperation to Others: Africa and 
South America are part of the Atlantic world as well, and 
we should gradually open up cooperation with these "dynamic 
. . . countries with varied strengths and a shared 
background."

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Stubb's focus on the EU reflects his longstanding 
commitment to strengthening that institution.  His eyes are 
wide open to its faults (for example, he has criticized its 
failure to use leverage with Russia as its main energy 
customer), but Stubb and many other Finnish leaders take 
their EU membership very seriously.  His focus on the EU 
does not represent a weakening of Stubb's support for 
NATO.  (He has described the EU as one of three pillars of 
Finland's foreign policy, along with Nordic Cooperation and 
partnership with NATO.)  He explicitly stated that his 
proposal 
is intended to complement, not undermine, NATO.  Stubb's 
speech drew no reactions in the Finnish media, as these 
themes are consistent with his and the government's 
views.
