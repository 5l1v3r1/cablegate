¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, Post submits the following update for 
the third week of April and first week of May 2009.  End 
summary.

PD Activities 
------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Somalia Unit, including the Military Information 
Support Team (MIST) dedicated to Somalia, performed para. 
3-10 activities since the last report: 
 
¶3. (SBU) After extended discussions with the senior staff of 
Mogadishu University, PAO arranged shipping to Mogadishu of 
the material for the long-awaited American Corner.  The 
material had been sitting in an embassy warehouse in Nairobi 
for several years.  The Somali coordinator for the project is 
an International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) alumni. 
PAO is completing an MOU and also working with AF/PD and IIP 
to augment the existing material and ensure this tool is 
utilized effectively. 
 
¶4. (SBU) PAO remains engaged with the TFG on their ongoing 
efforts to establish and maintain a credible media outreach 
operation.  In one notable success, PAO drafted a press 
release regarding the U.S. operation to rescue Maersk Alabama 
Captain Richard Phillips, which resulted in the deaths of 
three Somali pirates.  The press release highlighted the fact 
that the U.S. government had exhausted all options before 
taking lethal action against the pirates, who were holding 
Phillips hostage.  The Prime Minister's office published the 
press release almost verbatim, and Somali and international 
media outlets carried the press release. 
 
¶5. (SBU) PAO is engaged on a frequent basis with the 
Transitional Federal Government's (TFG)  Minister of 
Information, especially in light of both President Sharif and 
Prime Minister Sharmarke's having emphasized cooperation on 
media work in recent meeting with the Ambassador in Nairobi. 
 
¶6. (SBU) PAO met with Puntland President Farole and discussed 
cooperation in media work.  The President and his advisers 
were receptive to the offer.  On April 30, Farole's office 
published almost verbatim a press release that PAO suggested 
in response to the April 29 attack on Puntland Intelligence 
Service officers in Galkayo. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Somalia Unit published a press release to Somali 
media outlets for World Press Freedom Day.  Several 
journalists wrote to thank the U.S. government for the 
ongoing support and advocacy on behalf of Somali journalists. 
 
¶8. (SBU) MIST activity, weeks of April 6, 13, 20 and 27:  No 
programs were aired this week due to contracting issues. 
Programs will be aired as soon as all contracting issues have 
been resolved and all vendors have been paid for their prior 
work. 
 
¶9. (SBU) MIST activity, week of April 13 (cont.): On April 
18, MIST hosted a soccer tournament in Eastleigh, Nairobi's 
Somali enclave, with the theme &Youth for Peace in 
Somalia.8  Eleven teams of Somali youth showed up to the 
event and were given uniforms and soccer balls with the theme 
on them.  Each team also received trophies and CDs from 
Waayaha Cusub, the Nairobi-based music group with whom we 
have done a great deal of work.  The event went well with 
media coverage from Shabelle Media, Simba Radio, Quran 
Express, Somalia National Post, and Star FM.  We have also 
received numerous phone calls pertaining to the tournament. 
 
¶10. (SBU) MIST activity, week of April 13 (cont.): MIST has 
signed two contracts with vendors starting work on 01 May 
¶2009.  They will be using Sheikh Bundid, who will use Star FM 
to broadcast his lectures, and Simba Radio, who will continue 
with the peace and reconciliation radio program.  The old 
contracts for the vendors have been ratified and they should 
be receiving payment in the near future.
