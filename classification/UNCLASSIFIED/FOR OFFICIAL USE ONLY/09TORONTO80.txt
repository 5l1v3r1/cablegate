SUBJECT: RECENT CONVICTION ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HEIGHTENED COMMITMENT 
TO TARGET HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
 
Ref: (A) Toronto 12 (B) Ottawa 304 
 
¶1. (U) On April 16, a Toronto-area man was convicted of human 
trafficking, of gaining material benefit from human trafficking, and 
of other charges, making it the third such conviction in the Greater 
Toronto Area (GTA).  The case also sets a precedent as the first 
conviction in Canada under a section of the criminal code that 
specifically targets persons obtaining material benefits from human 
trafficking.  The conviction is an example of law enforcement 
officials increasingly focusing attention and resources on fighting 
TIP since Canada amended its criminal code in September 2005 to 
include anti-trafficking laws. 
¶2. (U) In October 2008, police from the Peel Region (just west of 
Toronto) arrested Vytautas Vilutis, a Toronto-area man, after he 
allegedly forced a local woman to solicit prostitution on online 
Craigslist classified ads and availed himself of the proceeds.  The 
victim accused Vilutis of controlling her movements, assaulting her, 
and threatening her when she did not turn over her money to him.  On 
April 16, Vilutis pled guilty to the charges of human trafficking 
and obtaining material benefit from human trafficking, as well as to 
assault, and has been sentenced to serve two years.  The case is the 
first conviction under section 279.2 (under the human trafficking 
criminal code 279), which specifically targets those who benefit 
monetarily from trafficking in persons. 
¶3. (U) Comment: This latest conviction, along with others (reftel 
A), demonstrates the increased resources (i.e. police officers and 
investigation hours) that Canadian authorities are committing to 
tackle human trafficking.  In the few years since anti-trafficking 
laws were introduced, police in Ontario have made great strides in 
identifying trafficking victims and prosecuting offenders. 
Moreover, each successfully prosecuted case demonstrates an 
increasing understanding by local courts of the tragedy of human 
trafficking, and the press reporting on such cases also helps to 
educate the public about the problem.
