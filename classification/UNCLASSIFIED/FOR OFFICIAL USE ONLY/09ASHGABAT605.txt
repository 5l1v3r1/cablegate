SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN COMMEMORATES VICTORY DAY 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for Internet publication. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  The May 9 Victory Day commemorations in 
Ashgabat focused on the fact that it has now been 64 years since the 
end of World War II.  Russian representatives held some special 
events marking the heroic roles played by Turkmen soldiers during 
the siege of Leningrad, and honoring the few remaining veterans in 
Turkmenistan.  The Turkmen Government handed out gifts and cash 
awards to veterans and asked local authorities to ensure their 
well-being.  Turkmen ceremonies centered squarely on the role of 
Turkmen soldiers in the war and the region's actions to support the 
war effort.  Althouh it is uncertain how many World War II veterans 
are still living in Turkmenistan, it is generally believed to be 
very few, given the low pensions and limited support they have 
received, especially in recent years.  Still, focusing on their 
heroic actions gave citizens an opportunity to remember their 
sacrifices.  END SUMMARY. 
 
REMEMBERING THE ROLE OF TURKMEN IN THE WAR 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  It has been 64 years since the Soviet Union declared 
victory over Fascism in May 1945.  On May 9, the Turkmen Government, 
much like those of the other former Soviet states, commemorated the 
victory by conducting formal events across the country.  President 
Berdimuhamedov, accompanied by some of the few remaining war 
veterans and the diplomatic corps, laid a wreath near the main 
"Great Patriotic War" monument and eternal flame in Ashgabat. 
Turkmenistan equally honors both veterans' bravery and the 
self-sacrifice of widows of the servicemen killed during the war 
during the holiday. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  In honor of the 64th anniversary of the victory, 
President Berdimuhamedov issued a decree awarding $70 and 
unidentified gifts to the surviving World War II veterans of 
Turkmenistan and to widows of soldiers who perished in the war.  The 
decree also stated that provincial governor's offices and town and 
district mayor's offices must ensure that veterans are receiving 
adequate medical care and have decent housing, but there was no 
detailed information regarding how the decree should be implemented. 
 Turkmenistan lost thousands in World War II, according to local 
residents.  For example, more than five thousand men were recruited 
from Farap district in Lebap province but only a thousand returned 
after the war.  Turkmen soldiers fought in Hungary, Austria, 
Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia and Germany, according to local 
residents.  An amazing 104 Turkmen were honored with the "Hero of 
the Soviet Union" medal, the highest military award and distinction 
that Soviet soldiers could earn. 
 
RUSSIA HONORS LENINGRAD'S DEFENDERS 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The Russian Charge hosted an additional Victory Day 
ceremony, where they presented memorial medals commemorating 
Leningrad's liberation from the German blockade to six surviving 
Turkmen war veterans who served there.  The award ceremony was held 
at the Russian Embassy.  Veterans of the Leningrad battle were 
presented gifts on behalf of the St. Petersburg governor, Valentina 
Matviyenko, including wool shawls, souvenirs, and money.  Continuing 
an annual tradition, the Russian Embassy also invited some 200 
Turkmen war veterans to a ceremonial dinner reception. 
 
MTS GIVES WAR VETERANS FREE OVERSEAS CALLS 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  In honor of Victory Day, the Russian cellphone operator 
MobilnieTeleSistemy (MTS) gave veterans the opportunity to 
communicate with friends, families and relatives for free.  MTS's 
"Call Brother-Soldier" promotional was extended to war veterans from 
May 6-9.  Veterans were invited to MTS service centers to place 
their free calls.  MTS is the largest cellular operator in

Turkmenistan, with more than a million subscribers.  The gesture was 
popular, given that pensions in Turkmenistan for World War II 
veterans range from $139 to $185 per month -- barely enough to 
survive.  Relatives of such veterans, if they are living in 
Turkmenistan, usually provide them with additional financial 
support. 
 
WORLD WAR TWO CARPET DISPLAYED 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  An unusual historic carpet made by Turkmen women during 
World War II was the centerpiece of a Turkmen exhibition devoted to 
Victory Day.  The nine square meter carpet was made in 1941, and 
features war scenes and images of life-sized rifles, grenades, and 
anti-tank weapons.  The exhibit also showed traditional jewelry that 
Turkmen women contributed to the War Defense Fund during the war. 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  The range of ceremonies and commemorations made 
clear that Turkmenistan's contribution of thousands of soldiers to 
the Soviet Army has not been forgotten.  The focus of ceremonies was 
specific to Turkmen heroes and actions rather than the heroism shown 
by soldiers from across the Soviet Union.  Still, it is encouraging 
to see that Turkmenistan has not distanced itself so much from the 
past that it is unable to recognize its citizen heroes.  END 
COMMENT.
