¶1. (SBU) Reftel requests that Post evaluate Brazilian candidates for 
the SEED initiative.  "Projeto Bagagem" is well-known to USAID 
Brazil.  USAID Senior Advisor Eric Stoner reports it is a 
community-based tourism network in Brazil. Stoner is familiar with 
the individuals who participated in the component training activity 
in Santarem, Brazil, which was coordinated locally by Projeto Saude 
e Alegria, a health and environment NGO that works in communities on 
the Tapajos River.  He is also familiar with the activities of FASE 
Gurupa.  All are worthy community-based NGOs and serve as home base 
for tourism internships in communities in their area.  Apparently 
they have other community activities throughout Brazil, and appear 
to be based in Lencois, which is a small town in western Bahia State 
in the Chapada Diamantina.  Advisor Stoner would give thumbs up to 
these candidates.
