REF: BANGKOK 1195 
 
¶1. (SBU) Recent meetings with the Royal Thai Armed Forces 
Headquarters' (RTARF) Peace Operations Center have confirmed 
that Thailand plans to deploy an infantry battalion to Darfur 
in March 2010 to join UNAMID peacekeeping forces, with a 
possible extended deployment of three-four years.  The Thai 
military has completed site surveys to the areas in Western 
Darfur that border Chad and the Central African Republic 
where the Thais will need to construct camps.  Following the 
site surveys, RTARF has been able to identify equipment 
needed to insure a successful deployment. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a December 3 meeting with visiting Principal 
Director (Asia and Pacific) Office of the Deputy 
Undersecretary of Defense Brigadier General William Crowe, 
RTARF Director of the Peace Operations Center Major General 
Jerdwut Kraprayoon and RTARF Director of Operations 
Lieutenant General Suraphan Wongthai confirmed that the Thai 
military would begin deploying to Darfur in March 2010 with 
the deployment completed by July.  That said, Jerdwut and 
Suraphan raised with BGen Crowe requirements with which RTARF 
hoped that USG could assist.  These equipment requirements 
are in part the result from the Thai battalion being required 
to deploy to two separate camps that are approximately 180 
kilometers apart.  Jerdwut and Suraphan stated that RTARF was 
interested in exploring various means of assistance, 
including taking possession of the equipment or accepting the 
items on loan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Thai officials also stated that the planned 
timeframe in which Thailand plans to commit forces to the 
UNAMID mission could extend from three to four years via 
annual troop rotations.  Each iteration of the Thai 
contingent would use the equipment, if provided by loan or 
grant, by transferring or leaving in place all said equipment 
for the replacement contingent. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Per discussions with BGen Crowe, Post is 
transmitting the below confirmed list of equipment requested 
by RTARF.  We request consideration be given for the Thai 
request via Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiative (GPOI) 
funds or by other means.
