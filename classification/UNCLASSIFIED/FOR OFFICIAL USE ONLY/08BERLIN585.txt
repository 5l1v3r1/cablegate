¶3. Post understands no assistance is needed with hotel

¶4. Visa Requirements:  U.S. citizen visitors and employees on 
training or consultations may enter Germany for a maximum of 
90 days without a visa.  Non-U.S. citizen visitors should 
check visa requirements at post prior to embarking on 
official travel to Germany. 
 
¶5. Mission Germany TDY ICASS Policy:  If requesting 
assistance that involves procurement of resources, valid 
fiscal data or fiscal data from travel orders must be 
provided.  Each visitor must bring or forward fiscal data to 
cover the direct costs of the visit, which will be 
direct-charged to their agency, organization, or delegation. 
Direct-charge costs include, but are not limited to, airport 
expediting, control room staffing, representational event 
support, American and LES staff overtime, travel and per diem 
for post personnel assigned to support requested field 
travel, rental of vehicles or other equipment, long distance 
telephone calls, office supplies, transportation, departure 
taxes and airport fees. 
 
¶6. Post and German authorities continuously review 
information that could impact on the safety and security of 
your visit to Germany. At this time, we are not aware of any 
specific, credible threats to your traveling party. 
 
¶7. The Department of State assesses German cities with a U.S. 
diplomatic presence as high for transnational terrorism and 
medium for criminal activity.  On 20 April 2007, The U.S. 
Embassy released a public announcement stating that security 
at U.S. diplomatic and consular facilities throughout Germany 
had increased their security posture in response to a 
heightened security environment.  This heightened threat of a 
terrorist attack continues and visitors are encouraged to 
consult with the Regional Security Office or Control Officer 
prior to travel.  The full text of this public announcement 
is available on the internet at www.usembassy.de. 
 
¶8. While there have been no recent significant domestic 
terrorist attacks in Germany, the country remains a potential 
venue for transnational terrorism.  German troops are 
currently deployed in Afghanistan and are assisting with the 
NATO training mission in Iraq.  In addition, the country 
continues to host a sizeable number of U.S. military 
installations, almost all of which are involved in our 
current military efforts in Iraq.  A March 2007 video, 
apparently produced by Islamic extremists, specifically 
threatened Germany with terrorist attacks as a result of the 
country's military deployment in Afghanistan.  In June 2006, 
two improvised explosive devices were placed aboard regional 
commuter trains in Western Germany; the devices failed to 
function and the perpetrators were apprehended.  In September 
2007, German authorities arrested members of an Islamic 
radical group who were allegedly planning terrorist attacks 
on unspecified targets, likely including Americans. 
Nonetheless, these incidents are a reminder that Germany is 
not immune from the threat of terrorism. 
 
¶9. The most common threat to official USG travelers in 
Germany is petty crime.  Pick-pocketing, bag-snatching, and 
confidence schemes are often perpetrated against obvious 
tourists and foreigners in large German cities.  Hotel room 
break-ins and thefts from automobiles, while infrequent, have 
 
 
occurred in the past.  Armed robbery, home invasion, and 
car-jacking are all but non-existent in Germany.  Taxis, as 
well as Germany's extensive public transportation network, 
are safe and may be used by USG personnel. 
 
¶10. Large-scale protests are a common feature of daily life 
in major German cities.  Only rarely are such protests held 
without police sanction, and German authorities are skilled 
in crowd control techniques.  The overwhelming majority of 
protests occur without violence, although marches and 
demonstrations by right-wing and Neo-Nazi extremists have 
recently drawn violent counter-protests from the left-wing 
community. 
 
¶11. Visitors to Germany should practice the same good 
common-sense personal security practices that are an every 
day part of life in US cities.  A heightened sense of 
situational awareness should be exercised when in popular 
tourist areas, train stations, and other soft-target venues. 
Large gatherings and demonstrations, regardless of the theme 
or topic, should be avoided.  USG visitors are encouraged to 
report unusual, suspicious, threatening, or harassing 
behavior to the nearest Mission Germany Regional Security 
Office at the numbers listed below. 
 
¶12. German law enforcement agencies are professional and 
extremely supportive to the U.S. government and all of our 
concerns.  The countrywide police emergency telephone number 
is 110.  The fire department and ambulance service may be 
reached at telephone 112.  The U.S. Embassy in Berlin reports 
current threat information for American citizens at 
49-30-832-9233.  Further questions regarding this assessment 
may be directed to the Regional Security Office in Berlin at 
49-30-8305-1400, in Frankfurt at 49-69-7535-2444, or in 
Munich at 49-89-2888-625.
