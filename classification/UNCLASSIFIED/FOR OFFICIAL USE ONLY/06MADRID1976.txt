REF: STATE 122513 
 
(SBU)   Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Sub-Director 
General for the United Nations Juan Manuel Gonzalez de 
Linares Palou on July 31.  Palou told Emboff that the Spanish 
delegation clearly understands the U.S. position, but that 
Spain does see a role for the UN in this arena.  Migration is 
a very important issue for Spain, given its recent problems 
in North Africa and the Canaries.  Spain agrees that any 
international forum on the subject risks becoming a 
do-nothing bureaucracy or worse, but it is their hope that 
whatever results from the High Level Dialogue could be 
something small with very little or no cost.  Spain's main 
concern is that there be some sort of follow-up to the HLD, 
in whatever form it may take.  In any case, de Linares said 
that the Spanish delegation will wait and see whether the 
dialogue is productive before making a final decision, this 
being the first meeting of its kind.
