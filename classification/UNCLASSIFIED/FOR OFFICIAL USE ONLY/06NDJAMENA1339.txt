¶1.  (SBU) Embassy N'Djamena would like to refer the following 
refugee resettlement case.  Below is the biographic 
information of the candidate, a description of the 
persecution claim, and a justification of resettlement. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) NAME: Daoud Ibrahim Hari 
    DOB: 1973 
    POB: Musbat, Darfur 
    NATIONALITY: SUDAN 
    GENDER: MALE 
 
¶3.  (SBU) DESCRIPTION OF PERSECUTION CLAIM: Applicant fled 
the region for Chad in 2003 to escape persecution by the GOS 
against the Darfurian community.  Hari arrived in Chad in 
April or May 2003 prior to the establishment of the refugee 
camps in eastern Chad, and came to N'Djamena in August or 
September to obtain refugee status.  From 2003 to 2006, he 
worked as an interpreter for humanitarian organizations and 
international media outlets who were reporting on the 
humanitarian crisis and atrocities in Darfur.  During this 
time, Daoud obtained Chadian identity papers and assumed a 
different name, in order to protect himself while working 
with journalists on sensitive issues in eastern Chad and 
Darfur. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In September 2006, he accompanied Chicago Tribune 
journalist Paul Salopek from Bahai, Chad into Western Darfur. 
 There, they were ambushed by Sudanese Liberation Movement 
(SLM) soldiers loyal to Sudanese presidential advisor Minni 
Minawi, handed to Sudanese authorities in El Fasher, and 
charged by the GOS with espionage, illegal entry, and the 
publication of false news stories.  After 35 days of 
incarceration and chronic mistreatment, including regular 
beatings and other forms of inhumane treatment, their release 
was successful negotiated by Governor Bill Richardson. 
During his time in prison, Daoud was recognized as Darfurian. 
 Upon returning to Chad, his identity as a Sudanese national 
became known to the Government of Chad. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Since his return to Chad, Har has been monitored, 
interrogated, harassed, and threatened with deportation back 
to Sudan by Chadian National Security Agency authorities. 
According to Hari, ANS officials are accusing Hari of being a 
spy for the Sudanese government and having knowledge of GOS 
support for Chadian rebel groups trying to overthrow the 
current regime in Chad.  Chad accuses Sudan of supporting 
Chadian rebels responsible for recent attacks against the 
Chadian government. Hari also suspects that certain ANS 
officials are also fearful that Hari will expose human rights 
abuses by the Chadian government, much as he has done in 
Darfur. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) On November 9, he was detained by ANS officials, 
who not only interrogated him for over two hours, but also 
physically abused him.  He was hit over the head twice.  He 
is currently being treated for his injuries, and UNHCR has 
offered him temporary shelter in the even that ANS officials 
continue to harass him. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) JUSTIFICATION FOR RESETTLEMENT: Embassy N'Djamena, 
which has spoken to Daoud directly and UNHCR resettlement 
officers, believes Daoud is under immediate threat of 
persecution by Chadian authorities on account of his 
perceived political opinions, and recommends that his case be 
expedited.  As long as Daoud remains in Chad, he will be 
subject to persecution in the form of interrogation and 
physical abuse.  Daoud is also at risk of refoulement.  In 
Sudan, he is at risk of torture, incarceration, and even 
death, and Sudanese authorities still view him as complicit 
in Paul Salopek's activities in September.
