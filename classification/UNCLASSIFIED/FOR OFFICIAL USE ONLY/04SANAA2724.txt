¶1.  (U)  On September 16 Pol/Econ Chief delivered reftel 
demarche to Deputy Foreign Minister Mustafa Noman concerning 
options for member nations to address Iran's nuclear program 
at the UNSC in preparation for the November IAEA meeting. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Noman responded that he believes Iran has reached 
the point where it can already produce a nuclear weapon, "or 
else it is very close.  I think it is too late," he said, 
adding that he hoped he was wrong, but that in any case no 
nation possessing nuclear weapons would actually use them as 
anything more than a deterrent force.  Pol/Econ Chief 
responded that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorists groups 
on which deterrence has no effect.
