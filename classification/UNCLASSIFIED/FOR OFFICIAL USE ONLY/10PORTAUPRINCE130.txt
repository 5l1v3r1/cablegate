February 5, 2010 
 
¶1.                  (SBU) Summary: Private sector representatives 
pledged support to Preval for a common strategy.  Minister of 
Justice Paul Denis re-established activities at his Ministry and 
appointed a new Chief Prosecutor and Dean of the Court of First 
instance.  The Government of Haiti (GOH) is struggling with 
planning sufficient temporary settlements.  The security situation 
is stable as the National Police has returned to pre-earthquake 
statistics for officers on duty. The risk of volatility, however, 
remains, but can be mitigated by an outreach to opposition leaders 
and sustained aid delivery.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
PRIVATE SECTOR MEETS PREVAL 
 
 
 
¶2.                  (SBU) Key representatives of the private sector 
met with President Preval and Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive on 
February 4.  A source close to the President's office and the 
business sector told PolOff that the meeting ended on a positive 
note, with the private sector representatives putting aside their 
political differences and committing their support to President 
Preval for a common strategy for reconstruction. 
 
 
 
¶3.                  (SBU) Opposition parties and civil society 
leaders have also proposed a common and unified strategy, but 
remain critical of President Preval's leadership.  Bellerive, 
however, rejected calls by opposition parties and some senators for 
a change in government.  The Prime Minister argued that a change in 
government would not improve aid delivery. 
 
 
 
JUSTICE MINISTRY 
 
 
 
¶4.                  (SBU) The Ministry of Justice resumed its 
activities in a new building downtown.  The Minister of Justice, 
Paul Denis,  nominated Marie Jocelyne Casimir - a veteran of the 
Court - as the Dean of the Court of First Instance, replacing the 
diseased Rock Cadet.  Joseph Manes Louis, just recently fired under 
Prime Minister Pierre-Louis' government, will return to his 
position as Chief Prosecutor.  Denis has used the case of ten 
American citizens held for alleged child trafficking as an example 
that the justice system is still working, but several national and 
local courts in the West and South departments (including the 
Ministry and Supreme Court) were destroyed or rendered 
non-functional by the earthquake and case work has yet to resume. 
Court activities, however, are slowly returning to normal in the 
remainder of the country. 
 
 
 
SETTLEMENTS 
 
 
 
¶5.                  (SBU) The GOH reportedly identified four new 
planned settlement sites that may house up to 5,500 people.  Other 
sites are pending approval, but would in total host up to 65-80,000 
people, a number still far short of what's needed.  The GOH will 
specifically have to tackle land tenure issues to enable the 
creation of temporary settlements. 
 
 
 
POLICE AND SECURITY 
 
 
 
¶6.                  (SBU) 4,600 police officers reported for duty 
in Port-au-Prince on February 3 despite the fact that no salaries 
have been paid yet, according to Director General of the Haitian 
National Police (HNP) Mario Andresol.  This number is similar to 
pre-earthquake statistics.  HNP reports having arrested 
approximately 100 of the 4,000 escaped prisoners. 
 
 
¶7.                  (SBU) With U.N. and U.S. security forces 
largely dedicated to the relief efforts, and the HNP tied down with 
rebuilding itself, vigilantism is likely to rise.  Canadian 
officials reportedly witnessed the extra-judicial killing of 
prisoners in the South by HNP officers, and reports indicate that a 
kidnapper was killed by civilians in Port-au-Prince on February 5. 
There are also reports that citizens in Cite Soleil killed two 
returned gang leaders two weeks ago when they attempted to 
re-establish control in their old zone, Ti Haiti.  Probably as a 
means of prevention, an HNP spokesperson publicly warned that the 
lynching of "werewolves" (possessed spirits in voodoo belief) in 
IDP camps will be prosecuted. 
 
 
 
¶8.                  (SBU) Overall, the security situation remains 
stable, except for sporadic incidents.  However, with relief still 
not reaching some individuals and allegations of corruption in aid 
delivery, there is a risk that displaced persons (IDP) camps could 
be utilized for political mobilization, including violent 
demonstrations.  Disgruntled political actors could leverage the 
desperation and built-up frustration in IDP camps, where thousands 
of homeless and jobless youth - easily  manipulated - now reside, 
to foment violence.  The transition from the U.S. military to 
civilian relief organizations and U.N. forces, combined with the 
upcoming rainy season, may further challenge that stability (Note: 
U.S. troops command significant influence in the Haitian "psyche;" 
several reports indicate food deliveries managed by U.S. troops 
have been smoother than those done by the United Nations). 
Continued stability will largely depend on the extent to which 
Preval is willing to reach out to estranged opposition leaders and 
the sustained effectiveness of aid delivery, especially during the 
hand-off from U.S. to U.N. forces. 
 
 
 
VENEZUELA INCIDENT 
 
 
 
¶9.                   (SBU) US naval officers were confronted by a 
Venezuelan national following the structural evaluation of a 
building requested by Haiti Port Authority officials on February 2. 
The Venezuelan national (unconfirmed civilian or GBRV official) 
accused U.S. personnel of being "occupiers," and claimed the 
inspected building was in use by the Venezuelans.  Press was on 
scene and recorded the confrontation.
