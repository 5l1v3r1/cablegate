¶4. Regarding police training candidates from Chey Sen district, 
Preah Vihear province, there was some speculation after a February 
2007 killing of an opposition party member in Chey Sen that the 
killing may have been politically motivated.  Some speculators 
believed that local police were involved with a cover up of a 
political motivation and perpetrator by forcing the victim's wife to 
confess to the killing.  However, a human rights NGO investigation 
concluded that the likely motive for the killing was a pattern of 
domestic abuse, and that the victim's wife killed the victim. 
 
¶5. U.S. Embassy Phnom Penh has reviewed its files and finds that, as 
of this date, it possesses no credible information of gross 
violations of human rights by the above individuals. 
 
¶6. Individuals will attend the Baker Canoe 09-2 at Sub-Operational 
Zone of Preah Vihear from April 27 to June 5, 2009. 
 
¶7. Action request: Please verify whether the Department possesses 
any credible information that the individuals named above have been 
implicated in gross violations of human rights.
