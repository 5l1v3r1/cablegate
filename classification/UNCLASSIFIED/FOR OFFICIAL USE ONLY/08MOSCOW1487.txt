REF:  MOSCOW 1302 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Afghan FM Spanta's May 26 visit to Moscow focused 
on expanding cooperation on economic and counter narcotics issues, 
without making progress on the Russian proposal to provide military 
assistance to Afghanistan.  On May 21 Moscow DAO received a 
diplomatic note from the MOD regarding the transport of goods to 
ISAF forces in Afghanistan (text at para 4).  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) MFA Afghan Desk Chief Yuri Kholkhov told us on May 27 that 
Afghan Foreign Minister Spanta's May 26 visit was a routine 
follow-up to Lavrov's trip last year to Kabul.  The FMs discussed 
expanding cooperation on Afghan economic development and counter 
narcotics efforts.  FM Spanta reaffirmed interest in continuing to 
send Afghans to GOR counter narcotics training programs.  Russia's 
proposal to send military aid to the Afghan National Army was 
discussed, but not in detail.  Regarding Spanta's statement to the 
press that the Afghan DefMin could visit Moscow "soon" to discuss 
possible arms transfers, Kholkhov said this required further 
coordination between the Russian and Afghan MODs.   Kholkhov told us 
that the Russian Embassy in Kabul has been instructed to work with 
the Afghan MOD on the military aid proposal but the MFA has yet to 
receive any feedback (reftel).  He promised to let us know once the 
MFA heard from its embassy.
