SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The March 14 meeting of the Paris Club reviewed the debt 
status of 24 countries, taking steps to prepare for debt treatments 
in the coming months for the Central African Republic (likely in 
April), the Gambia (in May), Sao Tome and Principe (in May), and 
Liberia.  Creditors confirmed their intention to continue acting as 
a group in encouraging Argentina and Angola to resolve their 
arrears, even as both countries have declined to accept an IMF 
program and hence do not qualify for a formal rescheduling of debt 
under Paris Club rules.  The Secretariat will approach Peru and 
Gabon to clarify their prepayment or buyback offers and convey 
Creditors' initial indication of a favorable response.  The U.S. 
will be able to accept prepayment by Peru, which could come to Paris 
for negotiations as early as April.  Creditors reported good 
progress toward completing bilateral agreements with Afghanistan, 
but not with Cambodia and Iraq.  Chad, Ivory Coast, and Kenya 
continue to have trouble meeting conditions for the next phase of 
debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) 
initiative, while the Kyrgyz Republic has declined HIPC status in 
favor of non-traditional bilateral debt relief.  Other countries on 
the agenda included Antigua and Barbuda, North Korea, Serbia and 
Montenegro, the Seychelles, Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, Benin and 
Senegal.

¶2.  (U) Creditors agreed to postpone until May 31, 2007 the deadline 
for Afghanistan to conclude bilateral agreements implementing the 
July 2006 Paris Club agreement.  Russia said it had just received 
(March 13) a response to the draft bilateral agreement it had 
proposed to Afghanistan and would be reviewing it in the coming 
days.  Germany said it expected to sign its bilateral agreement at 
the end of March.  (The US-Afghanistan bilateral agreement entered 
into force on March 16, 2007.) 
 
------ 
Angola 
------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Creditors agreed on a strategy for reengaging with Angola 
in the wake of the GRA's decision not to pursue an IMF program.  In 
recent months, Angola has cleared most, but not all, of its arrears 
to the Paris Club, excluding late interest.  In a letter sent to the 
Secretariat in February, the GRA stated it wanted to negotiate 
 
SIPDIS 
bilaterally the cancellation of late interest accumulated over the 
last 18 years (totaling approximately USD 2 billion, but none owed 
to the U.S.).  Creditors concluded that in the absence of an IMF 
program, a formal agreement to treat late interest would violate 
Paris Club principles.  Nonetheless, they concurred that resolution 
of late interest should be addressed as a group, and recognized 
Angola's good-faith efforts to clear arrears. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Paris Club Chairman Musca proposed the following 
strategy: 
 
-- Angola must first clear its remaining arrears (excluding late 
interest).  Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Sweden all 
reported arrears. 
 
 
PARIS 00001119  003 OF 012 
 
 
-- Once arrears have been cleared, Angola should unilaterally pay 
40-60% of the late interest due and then propose a schedule for 
paying off the balance over time. 
 
-- In return, Paris Club members' export credit agencies, at their 
discretion, could decide to reopen export cover.  (Spain confirmed 
that its ECA has already extended new but limited short-term export 
financing to Angola.) 
 
-- As an additional inducement, creditors might offer, on a 
bilateral basis but subject to Paris Club coordination, to reduce 
the late interest rate or any penalty charges. 
 
-- Creditors could also offer debt-for-aid and debt-for-equity 
swaps, based on existing limitations. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Citing precedent concerns related to debt treatment 
without an IMF program, the U.S. cautioned the Paris Club to be 
careful that this approach be clearly distinct from a formal 
rescheduling.  To that end, creditors should not formally normalize 
relations until all arrears and late interest charges have been 
cleared.  Despite this concern, the U.S. did not attempt to block 
the proposed strategy, recognizing the need for a creative solution 
and the fact the U.S. is one of only two creditors (along with 
Germany) to whom Angola is current.  The Secretariat will send a 
letter to the GRA expressing creditors' willingness "to explore the 
possibilities of total regularization of late interest payments on a 
multilateral basis" once all arrears have been cleared.  Musca will 
follow up by seeking a bilateral meeting with Angolan Finance 
Minister de Morais in the coming weeks. 
 
------------------- 
Antigua and Barbuda 
------------------- 
 
PARIS 00001119  004 OF 012 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The IMF said the new government has no interest in an IMF 
program, but is eager to normalize relations with its creditors. 
Total government debt is USD 983 million (102% of GDP), of which USD 
231 million is owed to external commercial creditors and USD 92 
million to external bilateral creditors (including the Paris Club). 
France, Japan, and the UK each reported that they had rescheduled 
some of Antigua and Barbuda's debt bilaterally in the past, and in 
each case payments were again in arrears.  Italy acknowledged that 
it canceled 90% of its claims in 2005 (stating that it reported this 
to the Secretariat at the time).  France said the new government 
contacted French officials seeking partial debt cancellation.  The 
Secretariat will initiate a data call, followed by a letter to the 
 
SIPDIS 
GOAB requesting arrears clearance and explaining the Paris Club's 
rules. 
 
--------- 
Argentina 
--------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Spain defended its decision to restructure its 2001 
emergency loan to Argentina outside the Paris Club as a "principled 
action" based on the loan's special nature.  Moreover, Spain claimed 
that the terms of the rescheduling, though not concessional, were 
not so demanding they could undermine Argentina's capacity to repay 
its remaining Paris Club debt (including to Spain).  Spain stressed 
it had made it clear to Argentina that the agreement could not be 
used as a reference for any future deal in the Paris Club. 
Creditors reiterated the importance of maintaining solidarity and 
staying on message (i.e., there can be no rescheduling without an 
IMF program, and Argentina should use its current strong financial 
position to clear its arrears in full).  The Netherlands continued 
to encourage creditors to consider creative solutions. 
 
 
PARIS 00001119  005 OF 012 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Chairman Musca stressed the critical importance of Export 
Credit Agencies (ECAs) not going back on cover prematurely; to do 
so, he said, would seriously undermine the club's leverage.  While 
Musca recognized that the Paris Club had no authority over its 
members' ECAs, he requested delegations keep the Secretariat 
informed of any ECA plans to reopen in Argentina, adding he would 
personally intervene to discourage such a move.  In response to 
Germany's request that the Secretariat approach the GOA, Musca 
indicated he would take advantage of every opportunity to convey 
again the Paris Club's message (and urged each creditor to do the 
same), but thought a true dialogue would not be possible until 
Argentina first made a serious offer. 
 
-------- 
Cambodia 
-------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) The U.S. and Russia reported no progress in concluding 
bilateral agreements implementing the 1995 Paris Club agreement. 
Russia said it had sent a letter to Phnom Penh offering to resume 
negotiations in March, but had yet to receive a response.  The 
Secretariat will send a letter to the authorities urging them to 
 
SIPDIS 
conclude these bilateral agreements and stressing the importance of 
inter-creditor equity when making payments.  Japan sought to 
reassure other creditors that Cambodia's recent unilateral 
prepayment was done without prior consultation. 
 
------------------------ 
Central African Republic 
------------------------ 
 
¶10.  (SBU) CAR is scheduled to come to the Paris Club in April to 
negotiate a Naples flow treatment under the Heavily Indebted Poor 
Country (HIPC) initiative.  The IMF said CAR could reach "Decision 
 
PARIS 00001119  006 OF 012 
 
 
Point" and be eligible for additional interim debt relief at the 
time of the first review of its Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Facility (PRGF) program in September 2007.  Completion of the HIPC 
process could follow as early as 2009.  Russia reported for the 
first time unresolved data discrepancies from its 1998 bilateral 
agreement with Cambodia (initialed but never signed), but sought to 
reassure the Chair that it could still work out this problem in time 
for the negotiations to proceed at the Paris Club meeting in April. 
 
---- 
Chad 
---- 
 
¶11.  (U) The IMF said the first and second reviews of the PRGF could 
be completed by end-May.  The reviews have been delayed due to a 
dispute over the management of oil revenues and fiscal overruns, 
resulting in the suspension of HIPC interim relief.  (The US is not 
a creditor.) 
 
----- 
Gabon 
----- 
 
¶12.  (SBU) The Secretariat said Gabon's offer to buy back its Paris 
Club debt at a 33% discount mixes two distinct options:  one is a 
request for debt reduction under the Evian approach, and the other 
to pay off the debt early, either at face value or a market price. 
Creditors agreed that, under the Evian approach, Gabon was free to 
pursue debt reduction once it had an IMF program in place, but also 
thought it would not meet the eligibility criteria.  Several 
creditors said they would welcome a prepayment at face value, and 
possibly a buyback at a market price, depending on the size of the 
discount.  The Secretariat said an appropriate market discount would 
certainly be less than 33%. 
 
PARIS 00001119  007 OF 012 
 
 
 
¶13.  (SBU) The Secretariat confirmed that buybacks are reserved for 
debtor countries having graduated from the risk of a Paris Club 
rescheduling and said Gabon was in this category (despite its 
apparent request for debt reduction and vulnerability to oil 
production declines and price volatility).  As a next step, the 
Secretariat will ask the GOG to clarify its request.  If a buyback 
 
SIPDIS 
at a market price is the goal, the Secretariat will begin technical 
work to determine the appropriate discount.  The IMF cautioned that 
Gabon does not have any market-traded debt that can be used as a 
reference. 
 
---------- 
The Gambia 
---------- 
 
¶14.  (U) Following the approval of a new PRGF, creditors are 
contemplating whether to invite The Gambia to Paris in May to 
negotiate the resumption of HIPC interim relief.  Typically, the 
resumption of HIPC interim relief can be accomplished by email, but 
in this case, the existence of arrears to Norway -- The Gambia's 
largest Paris Club creditor -- may require face-to-face 
negotiations.  According to the IMF, The Gambia could reach HIPC 
"Completion Point" at the time of the first review in the second 
half of 2007.  (The US is not a creditor.) 
 
---- 
Iraq 
---- 
 
¶15.  (SBU) Russia repeated its familiar refrain that its bilateral 
agreement with Iraq has been finalized but not yet approved.  The 
U.S. followed up on its January request (reftel) that Germany 
explain in writing its attempt to collect 100% of post-1990 
 
PARIS 00001119  008 OF 012 
 
 
pre-cutoff date claims on Iraq.  The German representative 
(attending his first Paris Club meeting) declined to go into detail 
and suggested that the issue would best be addressed bilaterally 
rather than in the Club.  He claimed the US was already familiar 
with the matter and that the Iraqis themselves had agreed the debt 
in question was not subject to Paris Club terms.  The Secretariat 
supported the U.S. position, however, that this was an issue for the 
Club and called on Germany to submit a written explanation of its 
actions before concluding any deal with Iraq.  Germany agreed but 
complained that it was being singled out unfairly. 
 
----------- 
Ivory Coast 
----------- 
 
¶16.  (U) An IMF mission to the Ivory Coast is scheduled for late 
April to discuss a new Emergency Post-Conflict Arrangement (EPCA). 
Fund reengagement will depend on clearance of arrears to the World 
Bank and African Development Bank.  They anticipate a sequential 
treatment plan that will allow new financing after arrears are 
cleared, a unity government is in place, and security improves.  The 
Secretariat will request creditors submit data to get a current 
 
SIPDIS 
picture of Ivory Coast's PARIS CLUB debt. 
 
----- 
Kenya 
----- 
 
¶17.  (U) The IMF has extended Kenya's PRGF again, this time until 
April 30, to allow time for completion of the long-delayed second 
review.  Creditors will decide at the April meeting whether to enter 
into force the third and final phase of Kenya's 2004 rescheduling, 
which is conditioned on completion of the review.  The third phase 
covers maturities falling due in 2006. 
 
PARIS 00001119  009 OF 012 
 
 
 
--------------- 
Kyrgyz Republic 
--------------- 
 
¶18.  (U) The IMF and World Bank said the GKR has decided not to 
participate in the HIPC initiative.  Responding to the Chair, the 
IMF did not think bilateral creditors would need to provide 
additional relief as a result of the KR forgoing debt forgiveness 
under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). 
 
------- 
Liberia 
------- 
 
¶19.  (U) The IMF said a Rights Accumulation Program (RAP) could be 
presented to the executive board as soon as the Fund receives 
financing assurances from Paris Club creditors related to the 
provision of debt relief under HIPC and MDRI.  The Paris Club would 
be expected to provide interim debt relief (Naples terms) upon 
approval of the RAP.  The IMF said Liberia could reach HIPC Decision 
Point very quickly thereafter, at which time the Paris Club would 
provide addition interim debt relief (Cologne terms). 
 
¶20.  (U) The Secretariat distributed the results of the latest data 
call.  As of January 1, 2006, Liberia owed the Paris Club USD 1.2 
billion, of which USD 1.1 billion consists of arrears and late 
interest.  The United States is the largest creditor, accounting for 
33% of the debt, followed by Germany (31%) and Japan (11%). 
 
----------- 
North Korea 
----------- 
 
 
PARIS 00001119  010 OF 012 
 
 
¶21.  (SBU) Russia confirmed that it had discussed debt issues with 
North Korea, but contrary to press reports, said it had not agreed 
to any debt cancellation.  Russia said North Korea has repeatedly 
asked Russia for 100% cancellation of its USD 9 billion debt. 
Russia has advised North Korea to normalize relations with the IMF 
and resolve its debt problems in a multilateral framework.  North 
Korea has declined to pursue this course of action.  Russia expects 
North Korea to raise the debt issue again in bilateral talks 
scheduled for late March.  The Secretariat noted that the Paris 
Club's solidarity principle does not exclude bilateral negotiations 
with a debtor country that has no prospect of a Paris Club 
agreement.  There should be a consensus within the Paris Club, 
however, before bilateral negotiations take place.  Switzerland and 
the Netherlands also reported holding North Korean debt, but have 
had no substantive bilateral discussions on any debt treatment. 
 
---- 
Peru 
---- 
 
¶22.  (SBU) Creditors welcomed Peru's offer to prepay at face value 
its previously rescheduled non-ODA (official development assistance) 
debt falling due between 2010 and 2015.  The Secretariat said Peru 
would decide on the precise prepayment amount based on the extent of 
creditor participation.  Noting Peru's relatively narrow credit 
spread (over the cost of U.S. Treasuries), the Secretariat estimated 
the market price of Peru's fixed-rate Paris Club debt at 5-10% above 
face value.  Germany and Italy questioned whether the prepayment 
should include a buyback option (i.e., at the higher than face value 
price) similar to the agreement concluded with Russia last year. 
The Secretariat will alert Peru to this possibility and expects 
negotiations to take place in either April or May in Paris.  The 
U.S. will be able to participate in a prepayment. 
 
 
PARIS 00001119  011 OF 012 
 
 
--------------------- 
Sao Tome and Principe 
--------------------- 
 
¶23.  (U) The Secretariat will invite STP to the Paris Club in May 
for its Completion Point debt treatment under HIPC.  Russia reported 
that it has not been able to conclude its bilateral agreement 
implementing the September 2005 Paris Club Terms of Reference.  (The 
US is not a creditor.) 
 
--------------------- 
Serbia and Montenegro 
--------------------- 
 
¶24.  (U) Several creditors (Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, 
Switzerland) complained that Serbia and Montenegro have refused to 
allocate debt between themselves according to the debtor/guarantor 
principle, and therefore no progress has been made toward concluding 
bilateral agreements.  Although feeling hampered by delays in the 
formation of a new Serbian government, the Secretariat agreed to 
send a letter to the head of the Serbian Treasury reiterating the 
Paris Club's position, as articulated in a November 13 letter, that 
bilateral agreements between the Paris Club and the two countries 
must follow the debtor/guarantor principle, unless the creditor 
agrees to accept the final beneficiary principle (as the U.S. is 
willing to do). 
 
---------- 
Seychelles 
---------- 
 
¶25.  (U) Creditors reported that they had received their share of 
the Seychelles' 4 million euros arrears payment.  The Secretariat 
will send a letter to the GOS thanking it for the payment and 
 
PARIS 00001119  012 OF 012 
 
 
encouraging the Seychelles to pursue an IMF program.  (The US is not 
a creditor.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Post-HIPC Countries - Comparable Treatment Follow-Up 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶26.  (U) The Secretariat summarized the responses received from 
Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar, Benin, and Senegal regarding their 
efforts to obtain debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors as an 
indication that more work is needed to ensure comparable treatment 
and debt sustainability.  As a next step, the Secretariat proposed a 
draft letter to IMF Managing Director Rato calling on IMF and World 
Bank staff to provide technical assistance to HIPC beneficiaries. 
The IMF reported that it already works with these countries on debt 
management issues and recognizes the need for capacity building, but 
also pointed out that it has little sway over non-Paris Club 
creditors.  The IMF will soon issue a paper on this challenge.  The 
Secretariat will circulate a draft letter based on these 
 
SIPDIS 
discussions.
