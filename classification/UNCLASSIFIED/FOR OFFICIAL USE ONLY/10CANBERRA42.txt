SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR, THINK TANKS TO REPRESENT AUSTRALIA AT 
PRT CONFERENCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 03595 
 
¶1.   (SBU) Australia will be represented at the upcoming PRT 
conference in Prague by Ambassador to the Czech Republic Ruth 
Pearce.   Australia does not have a deputy SRAP, and no high 
level officials from Canberra are planning to attend the 
conference.   Afghanistan Section Director Paul Noonan told 
us that Australia had initially hoped to send some military 
officials from Afghanistan, but because of conflicts with 
staffing patterns, they will be unable to do so. 
 
¶2.   (SBU) Rebecca Shrimpton of the Asia Pacific Civilian 
Military Center of Excellence will accompany Pearce to the 
conference.   This relatively new think tank was founded 
after the last election in 2007 to take a strategic look at 
the Australian military's foreign deployments.   The center 
has conducted several studies and conferences on PRTs and 
will provide technical expertise on the issues and regions in 
question. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) COMMENT: While the ambassador to the Czech 
Republic is relatively senior, no government officials who 
focus on Afghanistan will be attending the Prague conference. 
  This is in part because Australia is not formally a 
contributor to the Dutch PRT in Oruzgan province.   While 
they collaborate closely, Australia still sees its work as 
separate from that of the PRT.   END COMMENT.
