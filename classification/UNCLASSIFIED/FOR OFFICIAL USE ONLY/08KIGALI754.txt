REF: KIGALI 731 
 
(SBU)   Mission understands that the UN has contracted with 
VIM Airlines, operating out of Moscow, for the deployment of 
Rwandan troops to Darfur.  VIM is currently seeking landing 
and overflight clearances from Sudan and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, and so has delayed the 
initially-agreed October 20 start date for deployment.  It 
now projects October 25 for the first flights out of Kigali. 
Mission would not be surprised if this new date also slips, 
as VIM may have an overly optimistic assessment of how soon 
the various clearances will actually be in place.
