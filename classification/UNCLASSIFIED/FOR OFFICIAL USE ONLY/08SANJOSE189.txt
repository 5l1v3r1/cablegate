 ¶1. (SBU) On March 4 we delivered reftel talking points to 
Juan Salas, MFA UNSC desk officer.  Salas said he would 
forward the information to New York since, as a UNSC member, 
Costa Rica may play a role in decisions made regarding the 
possible disbanding of INMEE and imposing sanctions. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Salas offered no indication as to Costa Rica's 
position or intended actions on these issues.  We will follow 
up as needed.
