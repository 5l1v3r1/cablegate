SUBJECT: DONORS DEMARCHE ON HUMANITARIAN SPACE 
 
REF: HARARE 615 
 
¶1. (U) Minister of Labour and Social Welfare Goche refused to 
meet with UN and donor reps to discuss humanitarian space 
(reftel) because, he said, he was fully occupied as a ZANU-PF 
negotiator in the South African facilitated power sharing 
talks with MDC factions.  On July 29, Dutch Ambassador Jos 
Weterings delivered a demarche on behalf of the donor 
community to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary 
Joey Bimha.  The demarche (text e-mailed to AF/S and PRM/AFR) 
stressed the urgency of a blanket reauthorization of NGOs and 
the GOZ's responsibility to protect IDPs.  Weterings reported 
that Bimha took the demarche seriously and promised to 
discuss it with the relevant authorities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) IOM and CRS representatives told Emboffs on July 30 
that their contacts had told them the NGO ban would be lifted 
this week. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: The GOZ will likely soon allow NGOs to 
resume humanitarian activities, but will seek to exert 
increased control by providing selective authorization only 
to "well-behaved" NGOs and/or by closely controlling 
activities at a local level.  The donor community is 
currently united in its insistence on full and complete 
humanitarian access.  As severe food insecurity increases in 
the coming weeks and months, it will grow more and more 
difficult to maintain a united front in the face of a 
restricted opening of humanitarian space.  END COMMENT.
