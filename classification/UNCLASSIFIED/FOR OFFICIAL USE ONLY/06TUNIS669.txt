SUBJECT: REPORTS OF ANTI-SEMITIC STUDENT DEMONSTRATION IN 
TUNIS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: According to press reports and 
eyewitnesses, On March 10, approximately 100 students shouted 
anti-Israel and anti-Semitic slogans during a demonstration 
at Manouba University in Tunis at a ceremony marking the 
donation of books from the library of the late Jewish 
Tunisian historian Paul Sebag.  The students briefly 
prevented the ceremony from proceeding, but university 
authorities reportedly effectively contained the small 
demonstration.  While the events at Manouba were troubling, 
the sentiments expressed are likely those of only a small 
number of overzealous students.  The majority of Tunisians 
draw a clear line between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, as 
demonstrated by a communique from the Tunisian Human Rights 
League and a statement by the Manouba Student Union, both 
condemning the slogans and behavior at the Manouba 
demonstration.  End Summary 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  According to March 16 article in French newspaper 
Liberation, as well as university contacts, approximately 100 
students demonstrated before and after a ceremony marking the 
donation of part of the personal library of Paul Sebag, a 
noted Tunisian Jewish historian and sociologist who died in 
¶2004.  Sebag's daughter, as well as French historian and 
President of the Society of the History of Jews in Tunisia, 
Claude Nataf, were present at the ceremony, presided by 
authorities from the Faculty of Letters at the University of 
Manouba.  Upon attempting to enter the site of the ceremony, 
the party was met by approximately 100 students chanting 
anti-Israel and anti-Semitic slogans.  Liberation reported 
that these slogans, said in Arabic, included: "Down with 
Israel", "Long live Palestine and Hamas", "No normalization 
with Israel" and "The Jews to the Sea".  (NB: A French 
cultural attache who was present at the event reported that 
students also chanted some anti-Tunisian regime slogans). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Students reportedly tried to physically prevent the 
invitees from entering the facility, at which point 
professors formed a human chain to separate the invitees from 
the demonstrating students.  Eventually all invitees were 
able to enter the facility and the ceremony was held. 
Students reportedly continued the demonstrations upon the 
exit of the invitees and event organizers.  According to the 
Liberation article and eyewitnesses, there were no police 
present during the demonstration.  An unnamed GOT official 
told Liberation that Tunisian police "can not enter 
university campuses." In the wake of the event, the 
University of Manouba Student Union met and, according to 
university faculty, sided with university deans in condemning 
the demonstrations as "irresponsible."  The Tunisian Human 
Rights League also released a statement strongly denouncing 
the demonstration and the "racist attacks which dishonored 
our students and our university, and which represent an 
attack on human valor."  The LTDH communique also described 
the linkage between Zionism and Judaism as "inadmissible", "a 
disservice to the cause of the Palestinian people", and the 
"essential base of Zionist thought". 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Professors at the University of Manouba 
were concerned by the physical nature of the demonstration, 
noting that student rallies and demonstrations do occur but 
are generally peaceful.  Other student contacts report 
sporadic incidences of violence during campus demonstrations, 
citing rocks thrown through university building windows as a 
common tactic of only "a few troublemakers among an otherwise 
peaceful group of students."  One professor described "the 
deep confusion in the minds of students about the difference 
between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism."  Indeed, a majority 
of Tunisians would concur with the LTDH communique, and draw 
a clear line between condemning Israel and defending 
Tunisia's small, but notable Jewish population.
