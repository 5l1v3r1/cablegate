¶1. (SBU) U.S. investor, Merit Management, received its 
license to operate the Mallorca Casino in the Sol Melia Hotel 
in Colon on October 11, 2006.  After a lengthy battle of more 
than 12 months involving allegations of corruption and 
obfuscation on behalf of GOP officials (reftels), Panama's 
Ministry of Economy and Finance published its issuance of the 
Mallorca license in the Official Gazette.  The Casino 
Mallorca held a three day grand opening from October 12 to 
the 15 and is in its second month of operation with no 
reports to the Embassy of further difficulties with the 
Panamanian authorities.   Post considers this case closed.
