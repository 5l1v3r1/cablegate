REF: A. 09 PHNOM PENH 840 
     ¶B. 09 PHNOM PENH 745 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Takeo Provincial Court on February 19 acquitted 
Radio Free Asia (RFA) reporter Sok Serey of disinformation. 
The case stemmed from a dispute within a Cham Muslim 
community in Takeo (Ref A), where a community leader alleged 
that the local imam misappropriated funds belonging to the 
community mosque.  In October 2008, Sok Serey, a 
long-standing reporter for RFA, broadcast the story along 
with commentary from two human rights activists from the 
Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR).  The incident led 
to the imam, Riem Math, filing disinformation charges against 
two community members, the reporter, and the human rights 
activists. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In the February 9 hearing, Riem Math told the 
provincial judge he no longer believed Sok Serey was in the 
wrong.  All five defendants were thereafter acquitted on 
February 19, although one defendant who had been in detention 
since October 2009 was returned to jail, as he still faces 
separate charges on destruction of property (Ref B). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Based on an unofficial translation of the 
verbal verdict, the judge found no evidence of malice in the 
case and therefore no legitimacy in the charges of 
disinformation.  Such a finding would be a welcome sign of 
new-found sophistication by a provincial court.  While the 
statute in the UNTAC-era penal code defines disinformation as 
untrue information distributed "with malicious intent," other 
courts usually do not evaluate whether malice was present in 
a particular incident when ruling on a case.  END COMMENT.
