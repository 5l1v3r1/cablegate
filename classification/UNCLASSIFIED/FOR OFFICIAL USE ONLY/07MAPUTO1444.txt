(SBU) The Charge delivered reftel demarche to Vice Foreign 
Minister Eduardo Koloma on 12/4.  Koloma recognized that the 
concerns about Iran are not just the United States', rather 
also of the international community and Mozambique.  He 
agreed that Mozambique, as a signatory to the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, should see resolutions on Iran as 
consistent with the NPT.  He noted that Mozambique has 
inactive diplomatic relations with the Iran, and has only one 
embassy in the Middle East, in Egypt.  He assured the Charge 
that he would provide any substantive comment on the demarche 
after reviewing the nonpaper.
