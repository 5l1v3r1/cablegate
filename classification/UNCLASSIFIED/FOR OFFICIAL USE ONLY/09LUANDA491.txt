¶1. (SBU) During an August 7 call on Foreign Minister Dos 
Anjos, Ambassador delivered reftel demarche and queried 
specifically on the status of Angola's pledged $100,000 
contribution to support security in Somalia.  Seemingly 
familiar with the commitment, Dos Anjos said Angola is 
committed to securing and maintaining peace in Africa.  He 
said Angola always makes good on its international financial 
commitments.  Pressed on the status of the specific $100,000 
commitment to security in Somalia, Dos Anjos said he would 
check with the Finance Minister to ascertain the status of 
the payment. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  Given Angola's continuing scarcity of 
foreign exchange as the economy adjusts to drastically 
reduced oil revenues due to OPEC-mandated production cuts and 
much reduced oil prices, we would have little expectation 
that this payment will be forthcoming any time soon.
