REF:  A.  PARIS 7928  B.  HANOI 2209 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  GVN OFFICIALS CHARACTERIZED PRESIDENT 
TRAN DUC LUONG'S OCTOBER 28-31 STATE VISIT TO FRANCE AS 
"SUCCESSFUL," MUCH ALONG THE LINES AS EMBASSY PARIS' 
EXCELLENT WRAP-UP (REF A).  ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS HERE, 
FRANCE WOULD LIKE TO SEE VIETNAM "BE MORE FORCEFUL IN ITS 
REFORMS."  OTHER ISSUES RAISED, IF BRIEFLY, INCLUDED HUMAN 
RIGHTS, TERRORISM, AND ADOPTIONS.  SEVERAL FRENCH 
MINISTERIAL VISITS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR DURING 2003.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  PRESIDENT LUONG'S TRIP TO FRANCE CAME AT THE TAIL 
END OF STATE VISITS TO IRAN, NAMIBIA, CONGO, AND ANGOLA, 
FOLLOWING LUONG'S PARTICIPATION EARLIER IN OCTOBER IN THE 
NINTH SUMMIT OF FRENCH-SPEAKING NATIONS IN BEIRUT, LEBANON. 
HIS VISIT WAS THE FIRST BY A GVN STATE PRESIDENT SINCE 
FRANCE AND VIETNAM ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS IN 1973. 
LUONG'S LARGE ENTOURAGE INCLUDED ABOUT 100 GOVERNMENT AND 
BUSINESS OFFICIALS, INCLUDING FOREIGN MINISTER NGUYEN DY 
NIEN, HEAD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE NGUYEN VAN CHIEN, 
MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT LE HUY NGO, 
MINISTER OF TRADE TRUONG DING TUYEN, MINISTER OF HEALTH TRAN 
THI TRUNG CHIEN, MINISTER OF POST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS DO 
TRUNG TA, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH STATE-OWNED AND 
PRIVATE ENTERPRISES.  LUONG SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN PARIS, 
BUT WENT TO LYON FOR A DAY'S VISIT TO A PHARMACEUTICAL 
COMPANY AND THE REGIONAL COUNCIL. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  FRENCH EMBASSY EMBOFF EMMANUEL FARCOT CLAIMED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HANOI  02738  01 OF 03  130720Z 
THAT THE ABSENCE OF PREVIOUS STATE VISITS TO FRANCE OVER THE 
PAST THIRTY YEARS WAS NOT "PARTICULARLY UNUSUAL," GIVEN THAT 
ONLY "WITHIN THE LAST 10 YEARS" HAD VIETNAM AND FRANCE 
ENGAGED IN "MEANINGFUL" EXCHANGES AND PROGRAMS.  PREVIOUS 
HIGH-EVEL VISITORS HAVE INCLUDED THEN-PRESIDENT MITTERAN 
IN 1993 AND PRESIDENT CHIRAC JUST BEFORE THE 197 
FRANCOPHONE SUMMIT IN HANOI.  ON THE VIETNAMES SIDE, THEN- 
PRIME MINISTERS PHAM VAN DONG AND PIME MINISTER VO VAN KIET 
VISITED FRANCE IN 1977 ND 1993, RESPECTIVELY. 
 
-------------------- 
VITNAM A "PRIORITY" 
-------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SU)  ACCORDING TO FARCOT, FRANCE VIEWS VIETNAM AS A 
"PRIORITY" COUNTRY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.  FRENCH BILATERAL 
ASSISTANCE, WHICH AMOUNTED TO ABOUT USD 70 MILLION IN 2001, 
SUPPORTS PROJECTS IN: (1) LEGAL AND POLITICAL TRANSITION; 
(2) RESEARCH FOR EDUCATION MODERNIZATION; (3) RURAL 
DEVELOPMENT; AND, (4) POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND MEDICAL 
ASSISTANCE (REF B).  MUCH OF FRANCE'S ODA IS IN THE FORM OF 
CONCESSIONAL LOANS, HOWEVER.  FRANCE WILL LIKELY PROVIDE UP 
TO USD 30 MILLION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS A "LOAN" FOR THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE PHU MY II POWER PLANT IN SOUTHERN 
VIETNAM. 
 
¶5.  (U)  ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE, FRANCE RANKS SIXTH AMONG 
VIETNAM'S FOREIGN INVESTORS, WITH 120 PROJECTS CAPITALIZED 
AT ABOUT USD TWO BILLION.  (NOTE:  IN COMPARISON, THE U.S. 
RANKS 15TH, BUT MUCH US INVESTMENT COMES FROM US 
SUBSIDIARIES IN THE REGION AND SHOWS UP AS THIRD COUNTRY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HANOI  02738  01 OF 03  130720Z 
INVESTMENT, IN PARTICULAR FROM SINGAPORE.  END NOTE).  THERE 
ARE NEARLY 200 FRENCH COMPANIES AND ENTERPRISES OPERATING IN 
30 PROVINCES AND CITIES THROUGHOUT VIETNAM.  FRENCH 
INVESTMENTS FOCUS ON AVIATION (AIRBUS "COMPETES" WITH BOEING 
FOR THE VIETNAM AIRLINES FLEET -- SEE PARA 9), 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ENERGY, AND TOURISM.  TWO-WAY TRADE IS 
APPROXIMATELY USD 1.4 BILLION, WITH THE BALANCE (ABOUT 73 
PERCENT) HEAVILY FAVORING VIETNAM.  VIETNAM'S EXPORTS 
INCLUDE FOOTWEAR, TEXTILES, AND AGRICULTURAL AS WELL AS FOOD 
PRODUCTS, WHILE IT IMPORTS MACHINERY, APPLIANCES, AND 
PHARMACEUTICALS FROM FRANCE. 
 
¶6.  (U)  FRANCE AND VIETNAM STILL ENJOY SIGNIFICANT CULTURAL 
TIES.  FRANCE PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE ANNUAL HUE FESTIVAL 
AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER CULTURAL EVENTS.  THE NUMBER OF 
FRENCH TOURISTS HAS INCREASED FROM 25,000 IN 1992 TO 80,000 
IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2002, ACCORDING TO THE US- 
VIETNAM TRADE COUNCIL, MAKING FRANCE THE LARGEST SOURCE OF 
TOURISTS AMONG EU MEMBER STATES.  FRANCE PROVIDES 
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR ABOUT 400 VIETNAMESE STUDENTS ANNUALLY. 
APPROXIMATELY 400,000 VIETNAMESE -- MAINLY OLDER PEOPLE -- 
STILL SPEAK FRENCH.  HOWEVER, AS DR. BUI HUY KHOAT, DIRECTOR 
OF THE INSTITUTE OF EUROPEAN STUDIES OF THE NATIONAL CENTRE 
FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES, OBSERVED, "OLDER PEOPLE 
LOOK TOWARDS FRANCE, THE MIDDLE AGED TOWARDS RUSSIA, AND THE 
YOUNGER GENERATION TOWARDS THE US."

¶7.  (SBU)  FRANCE'S RESIDENT VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY, NUMBERING 
ABOUT 300,000, ALSO MAINTAINS LINKS WITH VIETNAM.  ACCORDING 
TO EMBOFF FARCOT, THE FRANCO-VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY IS IN 
GENERAL "FAVORABLY DISPOSED TOWARDS THE BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP."  SPECIFICALLY, FARCOT CITED THE "CONSIDERABLE 
MORAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT" AMONG THESE RESIDENTS FOR THE 
ESTABLISHMENT F A FRENCH-VIETNAMESE UNIVERSITY IN HO CHI 
MINH CTY.  HE OPINED THAT, SINCE MOST OF THE VIETNAMESE HAD 
LIVED IN FRANCE FOR A LONG TIME, THEY DIFFER FROM THE US- 
BASED VIET KIEU COMMUNITY, WHICH IS COMPOSED MAINLY OF MORE 
RECENT REFUGEES. 
 
-------------

------------- 
 
¶8.  (U)  DURING HIS VISIT, LUONG HELD A NUMBER OF MEETINGS 
WITH SENIOR FRENCH OFFIALS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT CHIRAC,

AND THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT'S EXTERNAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE

¶10.  (U)  TRINH DUC DU, MFA'S EUROPE II DIRECTOR, SAID THAT 
PRESIDENT CHIRAC HAD CONFIRMED TO PRESIDENT LUONG THAT 
FRANCE "HIGHLY APPRECIATES" THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  HE 
ALSO ASSURED LUONG OF FRANCE'S CONTINUED FOR SUPPORT FOR 
VIETNAM'S ACCESSION TO THE WTO, A REMARK WIDELY REPORTED IN 
THE VIETNAMESE PRESS.  DU NOTED THAT FRANCE HAD AGREED TO 
SUPPORT VIETNAM IN ITS BID FOR A UN SECURITY COUNCIL NON- 
PERMANENT SEAT IN 2008-2009. 
 
-------------- 
PUSHING REFORM 
-------------- 
 
¶11.  (SBU)  AT THE STATE DINNER FOR PRESIDENT LUONG, 
PRESIDENT CHIRAC CALLED ON VIETNAM "TO BE MORE AUDACIOUS" IN 
ITS REFORM EFFORTS, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF INCREASING 
GLOBALIZATION PRESSURES, ACCORDING TO MEDIA.  (THIS COMMENT 
WAS NOT REPORTED IN THE STATE-CONTROLLED VIETNAMESE PRESS, 
HOWEVER.)  EMBOFF FARCOT NOTED THAT "WE CONTINUE TO PUSH 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HANOI  02738  02 OF 03  130720Z 
VIETNAM TO ACCELERATE ITS ECONOMIC REFORMS," ESPECIALLY 
GIVEN THAT "SOME ELEMENTS" OF THE FRENCH BUSINESS COMMUNITY 
REMAIN "NERVOUS" ABOUT INVESTING IN VIETNAM.  AT THE TIME OF 
THE VISIT, A FRENCH PRESS REPORT CITED VIETNAM'S 
BUREAUCRACY, CORRUPTION, AND THE "WEIGHT OF THE STATE" AS 
FACTORS DRIVING AWAY POTENTIAL INVESTORS.  DR.KHOAT SAID 
SEPARATELY THAT PRESIDENT LUONG "WAS NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR 
CHIRAC'S COMMENT."  DR. KHOAT, WHILE CALLING THE CONCERNS OF 
POTENTIAL FRENCH INVESTORS "UNDERSTANDABLE," NOTED THAT 
VIETNAM "CAN THANK FRANCE FOR SOME OF THE WORST ASPECTS OF 
THE FRENCH BUREAUCRACY." 
 
------------ 
HUMAN RIGHTS 
------------ 
 
¶12.  (SBU)  EMBOFF FARCOT SAID THAT THE FRENCH 
PARLIAMENTARIANS RAISED THE ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
PRESENTED THE GVN DELEGATION WITH A LIST OF "PRISONERS OF 
CONCERN" PREPARED BY THE FRENCH EMBASSY.  HE NOTED THAT, 
WHILE FRANCE DOES NOT HAVE A SEPARATE HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE 
WITH VIETNAM, FRANCE "FULLY SUPPORTS" THE EU'S EFFORTS IN 
THIS AREA.  THE MFA'S DU AND DR. KHOAT SAID SEPARATELY THAT 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY WERE MENTIONED ONLY BRIEFLY 
DURING THE VISIT, HOWEVER.

TERRORISM 
--------- 
 
¶13.  (U)  BOTH SIDES STATED THEIR COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING 
TERRORISM.  DURING THE VISIT, VIETNAM REITERATED ITS OFT- 
STATED POSITION THAT ANTI-TERRORISM MEASURES AND 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION MUST CONFORM TO THE UN CHARTER AND 
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.  ACCORDING TO A 
VIETNAMESE PRESS REPORT, LUONG SPECIFICALLY "PROTESTED" ANY 
ANTI-TERRORISM ACTIONS THAT "INTERFERE WITH THE INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS OF INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES." 
 
--------- 
ADOPTIONS 
--------- 
 
¶14.  (SBU)  WHILE NOT REPORTED IN THE STATE-ONTROLLED LOCAL 
MEDIA, THE ISSUE OF ADOPTIONS ALSO CAME UP DURING THE VISIT, 
EMBOFF FARCOT AND DR. KHOAT SAID SEPARATELY.  IT IS AN 
"EMOTIONAL" ISSUE IN FRANCE, ACCORDING TO FARCOT, WHO NOTED 
THAT, IN THE LATE 1990S, THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BECAME 
CONCERNED OVER STORIES ABOUT BABY TRAFFICKING AND CORRUPTION 
IN THE ADOPTION PROCESS.  THE TWO GOVERNMENTS SUBSEQUENTLY 
SIGNED A BILATERAL AGREEMENT, THE RESULT OF WHICH WAS TO 
BRING THE ADOPTION PROCESS VIRTUALLY TO A HALT, MUCH TO THE 
CHAGRIN OF PROSPECTIVE PARENTS IN FRANCE.  EMBOFF FARCOT 
CONFIRMED THAT ONLY "10-15 BABIES WERE ADOPTED BY FRENCH 
CITIZENS THIS PAST YEAR."  DR. KHOAT EXPLAINED THAT THE 
AGREEMENT WAS DESIGN TO REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF PROVINCIAL 
AUTHORITIES OVER THE ADOPTION PROCESS AND TO ELIMINATE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HANOI  02738  03 OF 03  130721Z 
"CONTRIBUTIONS" MADE DIRECTLY FROM ADOPTION MIDDLEMEN TO 
VIETNAMESE PROVINCIAL AGENCIES AND ADOPTION INSTITUTIONS. 
EMBOFF FARCOT SEPARATELY CLAIMED THAT PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES 
HAD PUT UP "MANY ROADBLOCKS" IN THE WAKE OF THE AGREEMENT. 
(NOTE:  CURRENTLY, ADOPTIVE PARENTS FROM MANY OTHER 
COUNTRIES CAN MAKE SUCH "CONTRIBUTIONS."  AS A RESULT, AT 
THE PROVINCIAL LEVEL BABIES ARE NOW BEING DIRECTED TOWARDS 
THOSE PARENTS AND AWAY FROM FRENCH PARENTS.   ACCORDING TO A 
2001 GVN DECREE, ALL COUNTRIES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A 
BILATERAL ADOPTION AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM BY JANUARY 2003. 
THIS SHOULD EVENTUALLY RE-LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
------------ 
WHAT'S NEXT? 
------------ 
 
¶15.  (SBU)  EMBOFF FARCOT SAID "SEVERAL" MINISTERIAL 
VISITORS AR EXPECTED IN 2003, INCLUDING THE MINISTERS OF 
TRADE, AGRICULTURE, AND JUSTICE.  THE MFA'S DU CLAIMED NOT 
TO KNOW OF ANY SPECIFIC PLANS FOR FUTURE SENIOR-LEVEL GVN 
DELEGATIONS TO FRANCE, BUT NOTED SOME VISITS ARE "LIKELY" IN 
BOTH DIRECTIONS.
