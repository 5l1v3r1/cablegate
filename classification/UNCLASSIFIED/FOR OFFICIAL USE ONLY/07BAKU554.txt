¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador took the opportunity of a May 2 
meeting with Austrian Ambassador to Azerbaijan Marius 
Calligaris (resident in Ankara) to raise US concerns 
regarding reports of any agreement between OMV and Iran to 
develop Phase 12 of the South Pars gas field (ref a). 
Calligaris noted that he had heard from OMV CEO 
Ruttensdorfer, who told him the Ambassador had conveyed USG 
concerns directly to him during his recent trip to Baku (ref 
b).  Calligaris confirmed that OMV had not signed a final 
agreement with Iran and characterized the  document as more 
like a "letter of intent;" he also said the Mehr block oil 
agreement was not a final agreement.  Calligaris said the 
Austrian government had heard USG concerns regarding Iran on 
numerous occasions but noted that the Austrian government had 
only a limited ability to influence OMV.  While OMV is a 
state-owned company, it "operates completely independently," 
Calligaris said.
