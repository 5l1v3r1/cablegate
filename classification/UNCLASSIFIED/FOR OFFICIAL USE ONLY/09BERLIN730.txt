¶1. (SBU) On June 9, 2009, Charge d'Affaires John Koenig sent 
letters to Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and 
Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul to express 
appreciation for Germany's contributions to assist Pakistan's 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) and urge the German 
government to consider what more it could do to meet the UN's 
May appeal for $543 million.  Econoff and Poloff followed up 
separately with appropriate contacts. 
 
¶2. (SBU) MFA Afghanistan/Pakistan Task Force Director 
Ruediger Koenig told Poloff that Germany shared U.S. concerns 
about the IDP situation and was constantly evaluating what 
more it could do.  He expected further German contributions 
in the days and weeks ahead.  He also expected the EU 
Commission to announce a new contribution at the June 17 
summit, 20 percent of which flowed from German coffers. 
Koenig did not provide any indication that Steinmeier would 
answer the letter. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Maren Lipps, Pakistan Desk Officer, German Ministry 
for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), told Econoff 
that Germany shared U.S. concerns on the IDP crisis in 
Pakistan.  She said Minister Wieczorek-Zeul would be sending 
a formal reply to the U.S. Charge d'Affaires, most likely 
during the week of June 22, but did not have details on the 
contents of the letter.  The June 17 EU-Pakistan Summit would 
be in "troika" format, she explained, so there would be no 
high-level German participant at the event. 
 
¶4. (SBU) NOTE: Germany has thus far committed a total of 22.6 
million euros for Pakistan IDPs in 2009-2010 (REF B).  There 
are four components to this sum: 1) 5 million euros from BMZ 
announced on May 15, 2009 to be channeled via the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); 2) 5 million 
euros from BMZ already disbursed via the World Food Program 
(WFP); 3) 10 million euros from BMZ via UNHCR's 
Refugee-Affected and Hosting Areas (RAHA) Initiative; and 4) 
2.6 million euros from the MFA.
