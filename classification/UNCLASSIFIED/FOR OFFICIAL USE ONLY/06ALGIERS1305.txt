CRITICAL STATEMENT FROM MFA; REAFFIRMATION 
OF BEIRUT SUMMIT PRINCIPLES BY BOUTEFLIKA 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶1.  (U) In an apparent effort to get out in front of an 
Algerian public furious over Israeli actions in Lebanon, the 
GOA adopted an unusually high-profile posture the past few 
days.  The MFA issued a statement July 13 denouncing "the 
flagrant aggressions" perpetrated by Israeli military forces 
against Palestine and Lebanon, calling on the Quartet to 
bring Israel "to withdraw its forces, lift its blockade 
against the Palestinian people and Lebanese territory, and 
liberate Palestinians and Arabs detained in Israeli jails." 
The statement also stated that Algeria had never ceased to 
support the establishment of a Palestinian state with 
Jerusalem as its capital.  The press reported July 15 that 
that Algeria's UN Mission had called for the Security Council 
to take action to halt Israel's attack on Lebanon.  Earlier 
in the week (July 12) while on an official visit to London, 
President Bouteflika refrained from pointed criticisms in an 
address before the Arab ambassadors to the United Kingdom. 
He reaffirmed Algerian support for the peace plan adopted by 
the Arab League at its 2002 summit in Beirut, support for the 
roadmap, the return of Palestinian refugees, establishment of 
a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, and the 
recovery of Israeli-occupied areas in Syria and Lebanon. 
 
HEAVY GOA HAND IN SERMONS AT FRIDAY PRAYERS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The imams in Algerian mosques joined the chorus July 
14, the likes of which has not occurred since April 2003 when 
U.S. troops were entering Baghdad, drawing on GOA-issued 
guidance for Friday sermons sharply critical of U.S. policy 
in the region.  The guidance, to which imams across the 
country widely adhered, according to our contacts, condemned: 
 the American veto in the UNSC of the resolution proposed by 
Qatar; Israel's "inhuman and cowardly" aggression; the 
silence of the Arab nation "which fails to stand as one 
single person"; and the Saudi position on Hizballah's actions 
against Israel.  Based on a copy of the text circulated to 
all imams by the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the key 
portions of which were orally briefed to post by an imam 
contact, imams were instructed to say, "But we are used to 
the American double standard policy!" in conjunction with 
references to the Qatari UNSC resolution.  In reference to 
Saudi Arabia's criticism of Hizballah actions, imams were to 
declare, "Hizballah has a right to exist!"  Imams were also 
directed to note that Palestinians endured wars for ages and 
hoped one day to see Jerusalem "as the capital of their 
state.  May Allah grant them victory!" 
 
COMMENT:  STRONG RHETORIC LIKELY TO CONTINUE UNTIL 
IT IS IN BOUTEFLIKA'S INTEREST TO SOFTEN IT 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post contacts noted that had classes been in 
session, university students would "certainly have 
demonstrated" against Israeli actions and the U.S. veto of 
the Qatari proposal in the UNSC.  Such demonstrations, had 
they occurred in Algiers, would have tested the limits of an 
existing ban on demonstrations in the capital under the 
continuing state of emergency originally issued to combat 
support for Islamist terrorists.  Since university classes 
are not in session, the most likely public expression of 
anger will occur in what is expected to be a carefully 
controlled rally organized in coming days by the parties of 
the presidential coalition and the far-left Labor Party, 
according to Embassy sources.  There are no indications at 
present to suggest that street demonstrations will be allowed 
anywhere in the capital.  Whatever plans the government is 
formulating to vent popular anger, it is likely that the 
government will not seek to soften official rhetoric in the 
mosques or government media anytime soon.  By having remained 
thus far above the fray, President Bouteflika has 
strategically positioned himself to temper Algerian reaction 
at an appropriate time of his choosing.
