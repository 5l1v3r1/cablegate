(SBU)  Ambassador Arietti delivered reftel demarche on June 
12 to Foreign Minister Murigande on the margins of a 
diplomatic function.  Murigande expressed strong support for 
the transfer of the two AMIS battalions to the UN Heavy 
Support Package.  Murigande noted that inclusion of these 
battalions in the UN contingent would likely entail better 
logistical support and more timely payment of battalion 
peacekeeping stipends and other expenses.  Embassy on June 13 
delivered supporting background materials to the Foreign 
Ministry IO Director, who echoed Murigande's comments, and 
welcomed the materials.
