NIGHT VISION DEVICES FOR CTB 
 
REF: MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN IRAQ CTB AND 
     MNSTC-I FOR ENHANCED END USE MONITORING OF 
     NIGHT VISION DEVICES - OCT 16 2008 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request, see paragraph 10. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Country Team requests the immediate 
release of U.S. military specification night vision devices 
(NVDs) to the Government of Iraq (GOI). Specifically, this 
request is for AN/PVS-7D and AN/PVS-14 NVDs. These U.S 
military specification NVDs will be used by the Iraq National 
Counter-Terrorism Bureau (CTB) to train and equip Iraqi 
Special Operations Forces to fight terrorism in urban and 
rural environments at night in total darkness.  This will 
advance nighttime operational effectiveness while reducing 
collateral damage risk.  This request is for the sale of 
2,250 AN/PVS-7D and 2,250 AN/PVS-14 NVDs valued at an 
estimated $21.5M US dollars. END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Description of Technology for Release 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) NVDs provide high quality image clarity essential 
for safe night time counter-terrorism operations. They allow 
the wearer to select and clearly identify the enemy and 
reduce the possibility of collateral damage. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Rationale for Technology Release 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Iraqi Special Operations Forces are in urgent need 
of viable night vision capabilities that will allow them to 
safely and effectively execute night counter-terrorism 
operations, particularly in conjunction with Coalition 
Special Operations Forces.  Release of NVDs will greatly 
enhance their ability to conduct counter-terrorism missions, 
improve interoperability with Coalition forces, and improve 
their ability to maintain their own defense and security. 
Fielding modern capable NVDs will also contribute to eventual 
Coalition advisory transition of Iraqi forces to independent 
operations. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Iraq Safeguarding Sensitive Technology 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Iraq has demonstrated the intent and ability to 
protect sensitive, classified military technology since 
working with U.S. and Coalition forces.  An Article 505 
agreement (signed by the GOI July 24, 2004) demonstrates 
Iraq's commitment to protect grant defense articles and 
technology similar to our standards.  Additionally, a 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for Enhanced End Use Monitoring 
(EEUM) of NVDs was signed by the Iraqi CTB on 16 October 
2008, detailing requirements for the storage, security and 
inventory of NVDs. The MOA defines Iraqi responsibility for 
controlled access and 100% physical count inventory to 
safeguard NVDs purchased through Foreign Military Sales 
(FMS).  Upon request, inventory and accountability records 
maintained by the Iraqis will made available to U.S. 
personnel conducting EEUM through the GOLDEN SENTRY program 
and Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I) 
Security Assistance Office (SAO) Standard Operating 
Procedures.  We will also continue to mentor the Iraqi Forces 
on their accountability and control of NVDs in order to 
provide long-term cooperation with GOI.  All the necessary 
documentation of U.S. to GOI transfer, receipt and inventory 
of NVDs will be obtained, reviewed and recorded for GOLDEN 
SENTRY EEUM purposes. 
QSENTRY EEUM purposes. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Anticipated Reaction from Neighboring Nations 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) We do not anticipate the release of NVDs to the 
Government of Iraq to adversely affect the regional balance 
of power or cause negative reactions from neighboring 
nations, as these system are already fielded in many 
countries of the region. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Iraq's Political Importance to the Region 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) A stable, democratically-elected Iraqi government, 
 
BAGHDAD 00000039  002 OF 002 
 
 
capable of protecting its people and sovereignty, and 
remaining at peace with its neighbors is one of the USG's 
highest priorities.  The release and employment of NVDs will 
facilitate progress toward this goal, advancing the Iraqi 
security forces' ability to identify, target and carry out 
night operations against anti-Iraqi forces while reducing the 
risk to self and others. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Source of Financing and Economic Impact 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) This purchase will be financed by Government of Iraq 
funds.  The cost is estimated at $21.5M US dollars. There is 
no significant economic impact anticipated to be generated by 
this sale. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Relevant Human Rights Considerations 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶9. (SBU) There are no human rights considerations that should 
preclude the release of the defense equipment to the Iraqi 
Armed Forces. 
 
-------------- 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) We request immediate Washington approval for the 
release of U.S. military specification AN/PVS-7D and 
AN/PVS-14 Night Vision Devices to the Government of Iraq, for 
use by the Counter-Terrorism Bureau.
