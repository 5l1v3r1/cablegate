SUBJECT: PUBLIC MINISTRY OF LABOR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND FIGHT 
AGAINST CORRUPTION 
 
¶1.  (U) Consistent with President Lula's policy of reducing 
corruption in the Government of Brazil, the Public Ministry of Labor 
launched its Strategic Planning project on Wednesday, June 24, 2009, 
establishing the directives and goals of the institution until 2022. 
The Public Ministry of Labor is the first branch of the Public 
Ministries of the Union (MPU) to elaborate a planning initiative of 
this size and nature. The Ministry also reinforced its commitment to 
the National Campaign, "What do you have to do with corruption." 
This initiative endeavors to prevent the occurrence of new acts of 
corruption by educating future generations, encouraging popular 
complaints and punishing corrupt acts. 
 
OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The Strategic Planning project is an institutional agenda 
that will guide the formulation of public policies and internal 
administrative measures in order to improve the Ministry's 
coordination, efficiency and transparency. Its objectives include 
combating employment discrimination; eradicating infant and child 
forced labor and degrading labor; guaranteeing an adequate work 
environment; eliminating corruption in labor relations; combating 
irregularities among public administration; guaranteeing freedom for 
unions and pacifying collective work conflicts; strengthening 
institutions and strategic alliances; and attaining excellence in 
institutional management. Principal strategies of the Public 
Ministry of Labor consist of modernizing administration, stimulating 
creativity and pro-activity in confronting problems, strengthening 
the data and information bank and increasing mechanisms for 
interaction with society. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Public Ministry of Labor also stressed its commitment to 
the National Campaign, "What do you have to do with corruption." 
Developed by the National Association of the Members of the Public 
Ministry (CONAMP) in partnership with the National Council of 
Attorneys General of Justice (CNPG), the campaign attempts to 
prevent future acts of corruption. The Public Ministry of Labor's 
actions within the campaign are educational and promote honesty and 
transparency, especially among adolescents. Toward this end, the 
Public Ministry of Labor distributes information through television 
and radio intended to help develop character among the nation's 
youth. 
 
PERSPECTIVES 
------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) The President of the National Association of Labor Attorneys 
(ANPT), Fabio Leal, considers the Strategic Planning initiative a 
first step in the Public Ministry of Labor's fight against 
corruption. Attorney General of Labor, Otavio Brito Lopes, stressed 
the need for society to have knowledge of problems, stating that it 
is with transparency that advancement can be made. Lopes 
acknowledged that all the answers to fight corruption have not been 
found and that the Strategic Planning initiative and the National 
Campaign, "What do you have to do with corruption," do not solve 
problems in and of themselves; working with society is necessary for 
implementation and compliance. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Embassy Comment: It remains to be seen if the Strategic 
Planning will have much impact on corruption in public 
administration. While its launch is consistent with the common 
Brazilian practice of announcing high profile programs with little 
real funding, resources or follow-up implementation, it is 
significant that the Ministry is advocating concrete steps to 
address corruption in public administration.
