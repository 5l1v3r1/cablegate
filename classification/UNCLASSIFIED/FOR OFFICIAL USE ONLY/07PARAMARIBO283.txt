     ¶B. PARAMARIBO 133 
 
¶1.  (U)  Poloff delivered information from ref A to Terence 
Craig, Head of the Americas Division in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Craig had no initial response, but 
did repeat the frequent MFA line that if any action were to 
be taken, it would likely be taken as part of a CARICOM 
position (ref B).  Craig said he personally favors 
multilateral and diplomatic solutions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  When presented with information on U.S. 
immigration control aspects of 1747 enforcement, Craig 
highlighed Surinamese multilateral efforts in visa security. 
He said Suriname's central intelligence organ, the CIVD, is 
plugged-in to the stand up of a CARICOM-wide intelligence 
clearing center in Trinidad and already shares in information 
on specific persons and countries of interest.  He also said 
Suriname is working with CARICOM on the expansion of the 
security measures begun during Cricket World Cup, and 
specifically mentioned the Advanced Passenger Information 
System (APIS).  NOTE:  This is the first time Post has ever 
heard of any interest in APIS from Suriname, and Craig is not 
an expert on visa issues.  Craig did not elaborate or tie any 
of his visa security information specifically to Iran or 
UNSCR 1747.  END NOTE 
 
¶3.  (U)  Craig agreed to give information from talking points 
and non-paper provided in reftel to interested individuals in 
the MFA.  Craig said he would let us know of any further 
developments regarding this matter.
