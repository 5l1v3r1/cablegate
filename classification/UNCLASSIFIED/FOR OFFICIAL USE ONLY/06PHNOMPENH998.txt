SUBJECT: CAMBODIAN LABOR REACTION TO NEW LABOR MINISTER 
 
 ¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  Cambodia's newly appointed Minister of 
Labor and Vocational Training (MOLVT), Vorng Sotr (CPP), 
replaces Nhep Bunchin (FUNCINPEC), who was removed from 
office pending a corruption investigation.  The few labor 
observers who know Vorng Sotr from his previous position as 
MOLVT Secretary of State working on child labor and 
trafficking speak highly of him, but for most union leaders, 
he is an unfamiliar figure whose appointment comes as a 
surprise.  Despite the widespread belief that Nhep Bunchin's 
removal is more about power consolidation than 
anti-corruption concerns, most union leaders and labor 
observers are cautiously optimistic that a well-connected CPP 
minister will reinvigorate the moribund MOLVT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
FUNCINPEC's Nhep Bunchin Out, CPP's Vorng Sotr In 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2.  (U) On May 23, the National Assembly approved the 
nomination of Vorng Sotr, the son-in-law of National Assembly 
President Heng Samrin, who had been undersecretary of state 
for trafficking in children and child labor under the former 
Ministry of Social Affairs, Labor, Veterans, and Youth 
(MOSALVY) from 1998 to 2004.  When MOSALVY split in July 
2004, Sotr was transferred to the newly created MOLVT as 
secretary of state for child labor. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Former Labor Minister Nhep Bunchin (FUNCINPEC) was 
suspended on May 11 pending an on-going corruption 
investigation.  According to Prime Minister Hun Sen's 
accusations, the former minister allowed local labor 
migration placement companies to charge Cambodian workers 
bound for South Korea USD 1,000 each, nominally for passport 
and visa services which should cost far less.  Nhep Bunchin 
allegedly turned a blind eye to Cambodian migrant workers in 
Malaysia being sent to work in Saudi Arabia despite the lack 
of a Cambodia-Saudi Arabia labor agreement that would allow 
the practice.  Nhep Bunchin, who is a US citizen, is 
reportedly visiting relatives in California. 
 
ILO Child Labor Specialists Praise New Minister 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4.  (U) International Labor Organization--International 
Program to End Child Labor (ILO-IPEC) officers gave Vorng 
Sotr high marks for his work on child labor issues, though 
they noted that his efforts were frequently thwarted by the 
overall ineffectiveness of the MOLVT.  Menacherry Paul 
Joseph, ILO-IPEC Chief Technical Advisor, said that Vorng 
Sotr had demonstrated an openness to new ideas and helped to 
expedite approval of the ILO's action programs.  Khleang Rim, 
ILO-IPEC National Project Coordinator, noted that the new 
minister is known for fostering good relations with his staff 
and for his approachability.  Khleang Rim remarked that Vorng 
Sotr's background--growing up as part of a farming family, 
and serving as deputy governor in Kandal province, as well as 
two terms in the Ministry of Labor (MOSALVY and MOLVT)--has 
created a humble but experienced professional. 
 
Unions and Labor Observers:  Vorng Who? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) In contrast to the warm words from child labor 
specialists, most union leaders and international labor 
observers are unfamiliar with Vorng Sotr and were surprised 
by his appointment.  Anne Horsley of the International 
Organization on Migration summed up the feelings of many when 
she described him as an "unknown quantity."  Many were 
cautiously optimistic about the appointment's affect on the 
MOLVT, noting that under the leadership of Nhep Bunchin, the 
ministry was inactive and paralyzed by CPP-FUNCINPEC 
rivalries.  A CPP leader, they hope, will be able to break 
the deadlock within the ministry and will have the ear of CPP 
leaders as well. 
 
¶6.  (U) It appears as if the only major union leader familiar 
with Vorng Sotr is Chuon Momthol, leader of the 
pro-government Cambodian Confederation of Trade Unions (CCTU) 
and advisor to Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng.  Chuon 
Momthol described Vorng Sotr as hard-working and open-minded, 
someone who could deliver quick action on several stalled 
labor issues.  Chuon Momthol echoed many criticisms 
pro-opposition unions and international labor observers have 
leveled against Nhep Bunchin during his nearly two years in 
office: no labor background, lacking a sense of direction, 
and not engaged on key issues like labor law revision.

Unions and Labor Observers: Hun Sen Power Play 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Pro-opposition union leaders Rong Chhun, of the 
Cambodian Independent Teachers Association (CITA), and Chea 
Mony, of the Free Trade Union (FTU), criticized Vorng Sotr's 
rise as part of Prime Minister Hun Sen's recent consolidation 
of power.  Both leaders agreed that the MOLVT was ineffective 
and were unsurprised by allegations of corruption, but, they 
pointed out, many government ministries are ineffective and 
corrupt.  Nhep Bunchin was removed not because he was the 
most egregious offender, but because he was FUNCINPEC, they 
asserted.  Most international labor observers agreed with 
this assessment, seeing Nhep Bunchin's removal as motivated 
more by politics than by a genuine concern for battling 
corruption or helping workers.  Nonetheless, they hope that a 
more active and functional MOLVT could be the silver lining 
for this cloud. 
 
Key Issues for the New Labor Minister 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Vorng Sotr inherits a poorly functioning MOLVT that 
has been paralyzed by lack of leadership and 
inter-ministerial political divisions since the labor 
component split from the former Ministry of Social Affairs, 
Labor, Veterans, and Youth in July 2004.  Among the most 
critical labor issues facing him are: 
 
--Threatened General Strike:  Pro-opposition leaders Rong 
Chhun and Chea Mony have threatened to lead a general strike 
if their demands for higher wages, lower gasoline prices, and 
shorter working hours are not met.  Garment manufacturers, 
rival union leaders, and international observers doubt that a 
large-scale strike will come to pass--either the government 
will step in to make some compromises or the unions will not 
be able to gain the support of other unions needed to truly 
make this action a general strike. 
 
--Stalled Labor Law Review Process:  The current labor law, 
passed in 1997, is vague and contradictory and was written 
without the input of unions, which did not exist at the time. 
 Key areas of contention are expanding the scope of the law 
to include civil servants, informal sector employees, 
domestic workers, and migrant workers; working hours and 
premium pay; job protections afforded to workers' 
representatives; and Arbitration Council jurisdiction over 
individual disputes.  The new law remains in the discussion 
stage. 
 
--Labor Advisory Committee:  This critical tripartite 
committee is responsible for approving sub-decrees (prakas) 
governing all aspects of labor affairs, from minimum wages to 
defining hazardous and light work in the context of child 
labor.  The committee has not met since the MOLVT/MOSAVY 
split in July 2004, though several unions on the committee 
have been pushing for the committee to resume its work. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Since March, the Prime Minister has removed at 
least 76 high-ranking FUNCINPEC officials from office, and 
Nhep Bunchin appears to be the latest victim of his 
housecleaning spree.  The move consolidates Hun Sen's power 
not by removing a dynamic FUNCINPEC leader actively pursuing 
an agenda opposed to the Prime Minister's interests, but 
rather by clearing out the deadwood blocking CPP from full 
access to the Labor Ministry.  From a purely labor 
perspective, the change in leadership is probably a positive 
development.  Hopefully with a well-connected CPP minister at 
the helm, the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training will 
begin tackling some of the difficult issues that it has all 
but ignored in the past.
