SUBJECT: Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare Supports NAMRU 
Successor and U.S. Climate Policy 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: New Coordinating Minister for Social Welfare Agung 
Laksono told Ambassador Hume December 3 that he supports the 
finalization of details to form a joint biomedical research center 
to replace the Naval Medical Research Unit-2 (NAMRU2) before the end 
of March.  Laksono also confirmed that Indonesia agrees with the 
U.S. view that all nations must take action on climate change.  He 
called for U.S. partnership to support Indonesia's domestic climate 
efforts, including on forestry and peat lands.  Laksono urged U.S. 
companies to use their corporate social responsibility funds to 
advance Indonesia's climate and Millennium Development Goals. 
Ambassador Hume highlighted USG efforts on education and pressed for 
conclusion of the S&T Agreement.  Laksono said he would personally 
focus on culture and welcomed learning more about intentions for the 
TV hit "Survivor" to film in Indonesia.  End Summary. 
 
Laksono: NAMRU2 Conversion to IUC - let's enhance it 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Hume stressed the need to conclude an agreement 
to establish the Indonesia-U.S. Center for Biomedical and Public 
Health Research (IUC) as a way of solving sensitive NAMRU-2 issues. 
He explained that, while the U.S. had not pressed for formal 
negotiations in the weeks after the installation of the new Minister 
of Health, it was now time to find a solution.  Ambassador Hume said 
both sides must reach agreement on a new memorandum of understanding 
by March 2010 in advance of President Obama's expected visit. 
Laksono agreed, stating that NAMRU-2's work was good, but that we 
now have an opportunity to enhance it. 
 
On the same page on Climate Change 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Laksono, who also serves as Vice Chair of the National 
Climate Change Council (President Yudhoyono is the Chair), said that 
Indonesia agrees with the U.S. that all countries must make 
commitments on emissions reductions.  Ambassador Hume highlighted 
POTUS' recent meeting with President Yudhoyono at APEC when they 
discussed advancing multilateral negotiations and bilateral 
partnerships, especially on peat lands and forestry.  Laksono 
welcomed this cooperation and noted that Indonesia is planning many 
bilateral meetings in Copenhagen. 
 
Please encourage U.S. companies on CSR 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Laksono expressed hope that U.S. companies would 
participate in Indonesia's social welfare efforts through their 
corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, especially in 
climate change and on the Millennium Development Goals.  Currently 
14 percent of Indonesians fall below the poverty line, a number the 
government wants to halve by 2015.  Laksono said Indonesia can't do 
it alone.  Ambassador Hume expressed confidence that U.S. companies 
would answer the call, noting specific activities by Chevron in 
Aceh, Conoco in Solo and Klaten, and British Petroleum (half 
American) in Papua.  He also briefed on the ongoing effort to rally 
U.S. information technology companies to equip Indonesian schools 
with U.S. technology. 
 
Education and S&T Agreement 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ambassador described USAID's $40 million per year programs 
to support education, including developing university links between 
the two countries.  He also detailed USG partnerships through the 
American-Indonesia Education Foundation (AMINEF) to increase the 
number of Indonesia students studying in the U.S. and vice versa. 
He noted the July visit to Indonesia of education leaders of 30 U.S. 
institutions, and the 430,000 hits on AMINEF's website as evidence 
of increased action and public interest on education opportunities. 
Turning to science and technology agreement negotiations, Ambassador 
Hume urged Minister Laksono to encourage the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to conclude the text with us. 
 
Culture - "Eat, Drink, Pray" and "Survivor" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) In contrast to film "A Year of Living Dangerously" of 
several years ago, Ambassador Hume noted the opportunity to shift 
worldwide perception of Indonesia that the upcoming major film and 
TV productions can bring.  Specifically, he discussed the recent 
successful filming in Bali of "Eat, Drink, Pray" starring Julia 
 
JAKARTA 00001994  002 OF 002 
 
 
Roberts, and the intention of TV producers to film the next 
"Survivor" series in Komodo, Indonesia.  Laksono said that he 
personally would work on cultural issues in Indonesia and welcomed 
visiting Survivor producers to brief his ministry on their future 
plans.
