¶1.  (SBU)  We have conveyed the points provided reftel to 
Canada's Departments of Finance, International Trade 
(formerly part of Foreign Affairs and still charged with this 
issue) and to Export Development Canada, the Ex-Im 
counterpart.  Peter Cameron at Finance Canada confirmed that 
Export Development Canada has consulted with Finance and 
International Trade and is aware of their views on this 
issue.  Although EDC is "spiritually in the right place," on 
combatting bribery, some provisions of the action statement 
proposed by the U.S. pose awkward operational issues for some 
EDC products.  He said EDC lawyers are poring over it to look 
for solutions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Jean Cardyn of EDC said they have had very useful 
and transparent discussions on this issue with US 
counterparts at Ex-Im, Treasury and State.  Although EDC 
agrees with much of the USG proposal, there are areas where 
it goes too far, noting that "sometimes small words make a 
world of difference."
