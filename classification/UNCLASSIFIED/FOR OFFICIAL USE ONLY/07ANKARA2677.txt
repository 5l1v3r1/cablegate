SUBJECT: Update on PKK Violence (October 16-23, 2007) 
 
REF: ANKARA 2608 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) website, which documents contacts and clashes with the PKK as 
well as casualties incurred.  The TGS does not account for police 
casualties and the Ministry of Interior casualty date is not made 
public.  As a result, actual numbers for total Turkish law 
enforcement casualties are higher than the figures in this cable. 
Press services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) During the October 16-23, 2007 reporting period, 13 GOT 
security officials were killed, including one in a mine blast, while 
another 17 were injured in explosions. 
 
¶3. (U) In the same period, 35 PKK terrorists were killed.  Four 
PKKers were captured. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported one clash between security forces 
and PKK terrorists.  However, since an October 21 ambush that 
resulted in the deaths of 12 soldiers, the Turkish military has been 
continuing non-stop operations in the region.  Security forces 
discovered at least one PKK shelter/cave/cache and seized 
booby-trapped land mines; other explosives, including A-4 and TNT; 
Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; hand grenades; pistols; night vision 
binoculars; TV sets; satellite antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) During the reporting period, security forces detected 15 PKK 
explosive devices in SE Turkey, detonating several of them in 
controlled fashion before they could explode. 
 
¶6. (U) The PKK ambushed troops near Daglica, Hakkari Province on 
October 21, killing 12 soldiers and injuring 16.  Another soldier 
was killed in a separate landmine incident. 
 
Seventeen civilians were injured when the PKK detonated an explosive 
on a village road near Yuksekova in Hakkari Province on October 21.
