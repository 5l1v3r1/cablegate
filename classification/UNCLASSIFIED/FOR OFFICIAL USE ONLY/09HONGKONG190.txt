1.(U) SUMMARY: Dr. Golam Sarwar, a U.S. EPA atmospheric 
chemist and air modeling expert, was posted in Hong Kong as a 
Department of State Science Fellow from September 29 ) 
November 28, 2008 (Reftel).  His two-month stay was a 
positive example of how the presence of U.S.-based experts, 
working in cooperation with our diplomatic missions abroad, 
can vigorously advance both American environmental and public 
diplomacy goals.  Dr. Sarwar,s research in Hong Kong 
provided valuable new information about the relationship 
between air pollution-induced chemical reactions in the Pearl 
River Delta (PRD) and regional ozone levels. His research 
also confirmed that small respirable suspended particulate 
matter in the atmosphere is a serious problem in Hong Kong. 
Dr. Sarwar,s assignment and his collaboration with local 
scientists, activists, and government officials also clearly 
demonstrated our seriousness about environmental protection 
and laid the groundwork for future cooperation. END SUMMARY. 
 
Science Fellowship Reaps Positive Results 
----------------------------------------- 
 
Â¶2. (SBU) Dr. Sarwar came to Hong Kong to conduct air-quality 
modeling and other research to test the hypothesis that air 
pollutants in the atmosphere above the PRD are reacting with 
sunlight to produce nitrous acid (NO2), which in turn reacts 
with other chemicals to produce ozone.  Ozone can seriously 
affect human health when found in high concentrations in the 
lower atmosphere.  Soon after arrival, Dr. Sarwar met with 
scientists from the HKG Environmental Protection Department's 
(EPD) Air Science Group to brief them on his research.  The 
EPD enthusiastically supported his efforts by granting him 
access to several years' worth of data from their air 
monitoring stations in Hong Kong.  EPD officials also 
sponsored a trip for and accompanied Dr. Sarwar to 
Guangzhou,s South China University of Technology to consult 
with Guangdong Province EPD counterparts and researchers in 
mainland China. 
 
3.(SBU) In addition to the EPD Air Science Group, Dr. Sarwar 
met with and briefed faculty members and graduate students at 
Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Hong Kong University 
of Science and Technology (HKUST).  The HKUST Environmental 
Engineering Department offered to allow Dr. Sarwar to install 
U.S. EPA-developed air modeling software, updated with 
specific NO2 chemistry, and to run HKUST air pollution data 
through the model to evaluate the impact of NO2 chemistry on 
ozone.  Initial evaluation of the computer simulation data 
showed only a slight rise in overall ozone attributable to 
the NO2 chemistry.  Additional evaluation shows that ozone 
levels in Hong Kong, while present and problematic, on many 
days are well below U.S. National Air Quality Standards and 
EPA- recommended safe levels.  Ozone levels only exceeded the 
U.S. Standards on 28 days in 2007.  HKUST's Environmental 
Engineering Department is committed to continuing 
collaboration with Dr. Sarwar and will work with him to 
fine-tune the model using local data.  Dr. Sarwar and his 
partners at HKUST plan to jointly publish the results of 
their collaboration. 
 
4.(SBU) Although his original hypothesis on ozone was not 
supported by the Hong Kong data, Dr. Sarwar did confirm that 
respirable particulate matter at the 2.5 micron level (PM2.5) 
is a significant health threat in Hong Kong.  Hong Kong,s 
mean annual levels of PM2.5 are 2.6 times the U.S. 
EPA-determined safe levels for this pollutant. Hong Kong is 
just beginning to consistently measure PM2.5 and currently 
has no standards or regulations governing particulate matter 
below 10 microns in size.  In addition to his NO2-ozone 
research, Dr. Sarwar spent significant time with the EPD Air 
Quality Team discussing PM2.5 pollution and assisting them in 
fine-tuning measurement techniques.  The EPD is now 
developing proposed PM2.5 emission standards for enactment. 
 
Science Fellowship Boosts Consulate Credibility 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.(SBU) In addition to his scientific research and exchanges 
with government officials, Dr. Sarwar conducted numerous 
public outreach events in support of efforts to improve air 
quality in Hong Kong.  Dr. Sarwar presented seminars on air 
quality issues at the HKG EPD, HKUST, Hong Kong Polytechnic 
University and the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. 
 He also met with Hong Kong NGO,s involved in environmental 
issues and faculty at Hong Kong University.  He was 
enthusiastically received at each venue, raising visibility 
and awareness of the Department,s Science Fellowship program 
and Consulate General Hong Kong's own environmental advocacy

efforts.  Consulate General Hong Kong will continue reaping 
the benefits of Dr. Sarwar,s participation in the Science 
Fellowship Program and the solid relationships he forged with 
air quality experts from all sectors well beyond his brief 
tenure in Hong Kong.  His credibility on air quality issues 
has boosted our own efforts to encourage the Hong Kong 
government to tackle this serious problem.
