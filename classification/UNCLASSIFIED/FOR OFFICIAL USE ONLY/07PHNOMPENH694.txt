REF: STATE 64134 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU)  A/DCM met on May 18 with MFA Deputy Director for 
ARF matters, Nong Sakal, to discuss points outlined in 
reftel.  On the matters of UNSCR 1540 and the ISM for 
Nonproliferation, Nong Sakal indicated that he believed the 
RGC would support the USG positions.  With respect to the ISM 
Working Group Proposal, Sakal said that he has not yet 
received clear guidance from the Minister on this issue. 
Cambodia does have concerns about the added resource 
implications with respect to this issue.  Sakal added that 
Cambodia believes that there already exists within Track II a 
mechanism for addressing the issues that the USG proposes to 
be undertaken by the ISM working groups.  Sakal said that the 
Minister is traveling, will return in time to leave with the 
PM for Burma, and the ARF official worries that he will not 
have an adequate opportunity to discuss the matter before he 
(Sakal) must leave for Manila. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Sakal asked A/DCM about the USG position on 
Russia's proposal for inter-civilization dialogue.  Cribbing 
from the talking points in reftel, A/DCM noted that while we 
understood the Russian rationale for making such a proposal, 
the USG was not convinced that the ARF was the best venue for 
this discussion.  A/DCM added that the USG was favorably 
disposed to the Canadian draft; Sakal indicated that the RGC 
concurred with the USG position.
