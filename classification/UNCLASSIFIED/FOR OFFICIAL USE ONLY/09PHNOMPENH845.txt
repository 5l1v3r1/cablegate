¶1.  (SBU) Political-Economic Chief demarched MFA IO Director 
Tuy Ry November 16 on the Iran, Burma and DPRK resolutions in 
the UNGA Third Committee, noting the significance of these 
country-specific resolutions and urging Cambodia to re-think 
its past mixed record on these votes.  Praising Cambodia's 
principled vote in favor of the DPRK country human rights 
resolution in 2007, Pol/Ec Chief encouraged the Royal 
Government of Cambodia (RGC) to once again join the world 
community in seeking improvement in the human rights 
situation in North Korea.  Similarly, it would be to 
Cambodia's credit to vote "no" on "no action" motions.  If 
Cambodia could not vote "no" or abstain on some of these 
votes, the next best course would be for Cambodia to absent 
itself from the vote altogether. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Tuy Ry noted that both Japan and the U.K. (for the 
EU) had made representations on human rights resolutions, 
also arguing against support for "no action" motions.  He 
showed greater enthusiasm than in the past to the idea of 
Cambodia being absent for certain key votes.  However, he 
added that the ministry was still considering its position on 
these resolutions.
