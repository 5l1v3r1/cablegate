¶1. (SBU) Summary: On December 11-12, UNAMID sources told poloff they 
had received unconfirmed reports from the GOS that a large column of 
JEM vehicles had been observed crossing Chad border into Sudan. 
However, they were unclear whether this alleged mobilization 
signified preparation for new attacks within Sudanese territory, or 
simply a regular troop movement within JEM-controlled areas, as 
claimed by rival rebel commanders. UNDSS sources were also unable to 
confirm or deny details of a JEM mobilization or rumors of an 
attack. Meanwhile, JEM spokesman Ahmed Hussein denied any knowledge 
of the movement's military affairs. Nevertheless, he dismissed these 
reports as nothing more than GOS "fear-mongering", and chastised 
UNAMID for accepting them blindly. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On December 11, UNAMID Planning Chief Noddy Stafford told 
poloff that GOS sources reported a column of approx. 300 vehicles 
with military personnel and equipment had been observed crossing 
Chad border into Sudan (ref A). Two movements had been seen.  The 
first one between 1821 hrs and 1848 hrs on December 11 at Mado area 
(N 26:15'"15" E 14:37'25"), about 75 km NE of Mellit. The second 
column was observed at 2023 hrs at location  (N24:34'47" E 
16:04'02"), approx 220 km N of Kutum. All UNAMID sectors have been 
told to exercise maximum vigilance and attempt to confirm these 
reports through sources and patrols, he said. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On December 12 Stafford told poloff that SLA/AW and 
SLA/Unity Commanders in Birmaza and Kutum areas told UNAMID 
officials that no JEM forces had recently crossed the northern 
border into Darfur. Rather, the reported mobilization constituted a 
regular movement of troops within JEM-controlled areas, they said. 
Additional information received by UNAMID indicated that on December 
12, 100 JEM vehicles were spotted around Birmaza in North Darfur, 
though SLA/AW and SLA/Unity commanders in the area denied having any 
knowledge of this. Stafford noted that the mission of the JEM 
contingent had yet to be ascertained, but it was assumed that they 
were preparing to launch attacks within Sudanese territory, probably 
in Kordofan or El Fasher. (Note: Two days later on December 14, 
Stafford told poloff that he had no new information to communicate. 
End Note.) On December 15, the UNDSS Duty Officer told poloff that 
while rumors of a possible, imminent JEM attack were rife, UNDSS had 
been unable to confirm or deny them. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a conversation with poloff on December 15, JEM Spokesman 
Ahmed Hussein denied any knowledge of the movement's military 
affairs, but characterized the rumors as a "smokescreen" put forth 
by the GOS. "They're just seeking to shift the attention of the 
Sudanese people and the international community away from their own 
abuses and internal struggles," he said. "It's their usual 
propaganda." He expressed disappointment that such rumors receive 
credence from UNAMID, even though they have been proven false in the 
past. Hussein also accused the government of attempting to "create 
chaos" in Darfur, and stated that it was behind the recent tribal 
clashes between the Fallata and Habaniya in South Darfur (ref A). 
 
¶5. (SBU) Alleged movements of JEM forces have not restricted the 
World Food Program's (WFP) distribution of humanitarian food aid in 
Darfur, according to security officers with WFP.  "Relatively 
speaking, the situation is somewhat normal," Philip Tyrell, WFP 
security coordinator in Nyala, told poloff.  General UN restrictions 
on movement have caused the WFP to minimize non-essential activity, 
but Tyrell noted that this has not caused any specific operational 
cutbacks.  Kenneth Nichols, WFP security officer in El Geneina, told 
poloff that the WFP has increased the level at which it monitors the 
potential for instability in West Darfur, but WFP has already 
completed its December distribution operations there.  Nichols said 
he had seen nothing yet to indicate that West Darfur will become 
more unstable than it already is come January 2009. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: Rumors of a large JEM column of vehicles (on the 
scale described by the GOS) in El Fasher or Kordofan remain 
unsubstantiated, though post will continue to monitor the situation 
closely. Hussein's claim to have no knowledge of JEM's movements on 
the ground is not implausible, as many JEM political officials are 
left in the dark on military matters. But his claim that the 
government is solely behind the rumors of a JEM attack is not 
totally honest.  JEM recently released several new videos on its 
website showcasing its military strength and threatening new action 
against the regime (ref B). It is possible that JEM is seeking to 
flex its muscles before potential peace talks in Qatar, or that the 
GOS is using the alleged troop movements as a pretext for a 
potential offensive against JEM. Either way, the tense atmosphere 
does not bode well for the illusory Darfur ceasefire.
