SUBJECT: KIRKUK FACING WORST WATER SHORTAGE IN TEN YEARS 
 
This is a PRT Kirkuk cable. 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY.  (SBU) Low precipitation in Lake Dokan's 
watershed means that Dokan Dam's electrical generation this 
year likely will be 25 percent less than last year's and 
Kirkuk faces its most serious water shortage in the last ten 
years, with a significant impact on farmers in Kirkuk's 
restive Arab-majority west.  Dokan could increase water flow 
now, but only at the expense of late-summer electrical 
generation for the KRG.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
LITTLE PRECIPITATION MEANS LESS ELECTRICITY FOR THE KRG... 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) One year ago, the level of Sulaymaniah's Lake Dokan 
was 499 meters (approximately 55 percent of capacity), close 
to normal for this time of year.  This year, however, it is 
only 495 meters (45 percent) due to precipitation across the 
lake's watershed that was only 65 percent of the long-term 
average.  The Dokan Dam, which produces electricity for the 
northern Iraq grid, cannot generate when the lake level falls 
below 479 meters.  Therefore, to produce electricity for 
June-August peak season demand, dam managers must ensure that 
the lake level is high enough at the beginning of the season 
to sustain generation throughout it.  In an average year, 
Lake Dokan peaks in early June at around 504 meters (70 
percent).  This year, however, dam engineers expect to 
achieve only about 500 meters (56 percent) by June 1. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Based on historical data, the PRT Agriculture 
Advisor estimates that Dokan Dam's electrical generation this 
year likely will be 25 percent lower than last year's. 
Moreover, to achieve even the current low lake level, dam 
managers have reduced outflow at the expense of Kirkuk 
province's users, who receive water from Dokan via the Dibbis 
Dam.  At Dibbis, the flow from Dokan (plus a smaller, natural 
flow from the Lesser Zab River) is divided evenly between the 
channel that serves Kirkuk city municipal and industrial 
users (including the North Oil Company and affiliated 
petroleum-sector companies) and the Lesser Zab, which 
supplies the water and irrigation needs of Kirkuk's 
agricultural, restive, Arab-majority west. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
...AND A SEVERE WATER SHORTAGE IN KIRKUK 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Dokan's current daily average output is 25 cubic 
meters/second.  Even with the smaller flow from the Lesser 
Zab added, the combined flow is not enough to meet Kirkuk's 
minimum needs.  As a result, Kirkuk's municipal users receive 
12 hours or less of water per day.  Farmers in western Kirkuk 
are particularly hard hit, as moisture remains inadequate for 
both the maturing fall-planted grain crop and spring-planted 
crops.  The PRT agriculture advisor estimates that only 20-25 
percent of irrigated crops are getting sufficient water. 
Arab members of the Kirkuk Provincial Council (PC) and Arab 
leaders in western Kirkuk have complained to PRT officers 
that the KRG is holding Lake Dokan's water "hostage" to 
secure additional electricity supplies from Baghdad and 
request CF assistance in increasing dam output. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The PRT Agriculture Advisor projects that the 
average daily outflow from Dokan for the March-May period 
will be the lowest in the last ten years.  He estimates that 
Dokan could increase daily average outflow now to 45-50 cubic 
meters/second, but that reducing the lake's peak level to do 
so would reduce the dam's power generation season by a few 
days at the end of summer.  Heavy rains would ease the 
situation, but are increasingly unlikely; the rainy season 
will end soon, if it has not already. 
 
---------------------- 
COMMENT: PRAY FOR RAIN 
---------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Over the last ten years -- even in dry years -- 
Dokan daily average output was at least 45-50 cubic 
meters/second.  However, demand for electricity has increased 
substantially since 2003, and dam management clearly is 
trying to build a water reserve to maximize electrical 
generation for the northern Iraq grid later this summer. 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Kirkuk has been short of water the last two years, 
and complaints about it have become routine.  This year, 
however, the pain is worse: Without significant additional

rainfall or an increase in Dokan output soon, Kirkuk faces 
its most serious water shortage of the last ten years.  The 
Dibbis Dam manager says that Dokan might increase outflow in 
mid-May.  However, according to the PRT Agriculture Advisor, 
this would come too late for Kirkuk's farmers, who need the 
water now for their maturing grain crop and spring-planted 
crops.  Recent heavy rains and moderate temperatures mean 
that fields are still green.  However, the lack of water will 
begin to tell soon, when temperatures rise.  Kirkuk's farmers 
likely will have to get the water they need from wells using 
pumps powered by scarce and expensive diesel fuel.
