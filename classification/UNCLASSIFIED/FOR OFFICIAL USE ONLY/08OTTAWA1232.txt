¶1. (sbu) Canada plans no new pledges at the September 22 Ad 
Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) meeting in New York, according 
to Louise Corbin, Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) Deputy Director for Israel, West 
Bank, and Gaza.  Corbin told Econcouns that Canada had 
pledged C$300 million (to be dispersed over five years) at 
the December 2007 Paris Donor Conference (refs b and c) -- 
and that the first C$15 million in direct budget support of 
the Palestinian Authority had just been released in August. 
Corbin said no more funds would be dispersed in 2008, but she 
expected another C$45 million would be released before the 
end of Canada's fiscal year on March 30. 
 
¶2. (sbu) Corbin stated that because of Canada's ongoing 
election campaign, no ministers or deputy ministers would 
attend the AHLC.  Instead, Canada will be represented by 
DFAIT Assistant Deputy Minister James Fox, DFAIT Middle East 
Director General Michael Grant, and Isabelle Berard, Director 
of the Middle East Division at the Canadian International 
Development Agency.
