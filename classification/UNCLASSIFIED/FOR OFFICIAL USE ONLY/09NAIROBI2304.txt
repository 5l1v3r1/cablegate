Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per ref B, Post submits the following update for the 
first week of November 2009.  End Summary. 
 
------------- 
PD Activities 
------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Somalia Unit, including the Military Information 
Support Team (MIST) dedicated to Somalia, performed para. 3-7 
activities since the last report: 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Somalia Unit continues to work with the Minister 
of Information in an effort to augment the Transitional 
Federal Government's (TFG) media efforts.  In conjunction 
with this effort, the minister recently secured a new 
transmitter for Radio Mogadishu.  This transmitter has 
increased the broadcast range from a few blocks to 100 
kilometers from Mogadishu.  Somalia Unit is working with 
AF/PD to coordinate an assistance package that will include a 
media expert, a backup transmitter, and other items necessary 
to strengthen the ministry.  In the meantime, the Somalia 
Unit continues to offer suggestions and advice on the TFG's 
outreach efforts. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Somalia Unit hosted a reception on October 13 to 
commemorate Somalia's Flag Day, which had been suggested by 
contacts as a holiday free from political, clan or other 
negative historical baggage.  A committee of Somalis 
coordinated the programming, which appealed to the patriotism 
of all Somalis.  The reception resulted in wide and positive 
media coverage and excellent feedback from the attendees. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Somalia Unit helped facilitate a press roundtable 
for Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees and 
Migration (PRM) Eric Schwartz and Ambassador Ranneberger on 
October 22.  A/S Schwartz reviewed his travel to refugee 
camps in Kenya and the DRC, highlighting U.S. efforts to aid 
the refugees as well as U.S. efforts to achieve stability in 
Somalia.  We followed the press conference with a November 2 
press release to Somalia media, coordinated with PRM. 
 
¶6. (SBU) PAO attended the worldwide PAO conference in 
mid-October and engaged in fruitful consultations with 
several offices in AF. 
 
¶7. (SBU) MIST activity:  The MIST has continued to broadcast 
moderate Islamic, anti-violence messages throughout Somalia 
and the Northeastern Province of Kenya.  The youth 
anti-violence drama 'Maslaxo' (mediation) continues to be 
broadcast in Mogadishu and in Puntland.  The MIST also 
continues planning CDs and comic books to augment the Islamic 
and youth programs.  In support of the newly-revamped Radio 
Mogadishu, MIST is developing a pro-TFG radio advertisement 
and video promoting Somali nationalism & reconciliation.
