SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN UPDATE -- DECEMBER 29 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  An estimated 55 truckloads of 
humanitarian supplies entered Gaza through Kerem Shalom 
crossing on December 29, according to UN contacts.  21 
truckloads entered on December 28.  Food levels remain 
critically low, and no fuel has entered Gaza since December 
¶26.  End Summary. 
 
Humanitarian Assistance 
----------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Approximately 55 trucks entered Gaza via Kerem 
Shalom on December 29, the majority of which contained food 
supplies.  Seven truckloads contained medical supplies -- 
three for the Ministry of Health, three for ICRC, and one for 
UNRWA.  Five ambulances were delivered by the ICRC.  In 
addition, three truckloads of medical supplies from Egyptian 
Red Crescent entered Gaza via Rafah crossing.  On December 
28, 21 truckloads -- including 15 for humanitarian aid 
agencies -- entered via Kerem Shalom. 
 
Medical Supplies and Health Care 
------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) There are 27 hospitals in Gaza (13 are MOH, the 
remainder are private and NGO-run) with roughly a 2,000-bed 
capacity.  ICRC and PRCS have identified priority needs as 
emergency surgical kits, emergency first aid kits, IV fluids, 
and spare parts for generators and other medical equipment. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), current 
pharmaceutical stocks are sufficient for less than one week 
in a conflict environment, and 25 percent of essential 
pharmaceuticals and 225 consumable medical items are at zero 
stocks.  On December 28, ICRC and UNICEF delivered 400 "war 
wounded" kits and 300 first aid kits to Gaza hospitals. 
However, health sector workers in Gaza are overwhelmed with 
more than 900 injured, at least 115 of whom are in critical 
condition.  Health workers report they are having difficulty 
reaching their places of work due to ongoing IAF strikes. 
 
Food supplies 
------------- 
¶4. (SBU) The most urgent food need in Gaza is for wheat 
grain/flour, according to WHO contacts.  UNRWA's emergency 
food program for 750,000 Palestinian refugees in Gaza has 
been suspended since December 19 as a result of flour 
shortages.  Bakeries across Gaza are also reportedly closed. 
UNRWA requires 3,000 MT of wheat (100 truckloads) to clear 
the backlogged distributions and another 250 MT (7-8 
truckloads) per day for regular distributions. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On December 28, ten trucks of flour for WFP and 
three trucks of food items for the private sector entered 
Gaza.  On December 29, UNRWA planned to bring in 10 
truckloads of rice, sugar, and milk through Kerem Shalom and 
1,200 metric tons of wheat via the Karni conveyor belt. 
However, as of 1600, Karni was closed.  UNRWA contacts noted 
that importing bulk wheat grain is not possible at any other 
crossing. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Local business contacts report that few goods are 
coming through the Gaza tunnel system, as tunnel operators 
are concerned about IDF airstrikes and are staying home. 
 
Fuel Supplies 
------------- 
¶7. (SBU) No fuel has entered Gaza since December 26.  The 
power plant remained operational through December 29 with one 
turbine, but will be forced to shut down around midnight. 
UNRWA reports that it has sufficient petrol and diesel 
reserves for three weeks of operations, and can support 
hospital generators on a limited basis for one month. 
 
Cash 
---- 
¶8. (SBU) The cash shortage in the formal banking sector 
remains a critical issue.  UNRWA's cash assistance program 
for 94,000 special hardship cases remains suspended since 
November 20, and UNRWA staff were paid only 50 percent of 
their December salaries.
