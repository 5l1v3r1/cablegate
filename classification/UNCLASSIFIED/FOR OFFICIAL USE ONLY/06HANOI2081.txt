Â¶1. (SBU) In a brief statement August 14, MFA spokesman Le Dzung 
expressed his government's support for United Nations Security 
Council resolution 1701, noting that it attempts to bring the 
month-long conflict in southern Lebanon to an end.  The GVN "urges 
all the concerned parties to implement the resolution strictly and 
take practical steps to restore peace to the region," Dzung 
concluded.
