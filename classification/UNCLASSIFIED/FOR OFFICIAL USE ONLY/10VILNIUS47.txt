(SBU)  We met with MFA's lead on Afghanistan issues 
Valdamaras Sarapinas on January 21 to discuss the upcoming 
London Conference on Afghanistan and, more broadly, 
Lithuania's go-forward strategy in Afghanistan (SEPTEL). 
Sarapinas will attend the London Conference together with the 
GOL's Ambassador to the UK Oskaras Juysys.  On January 22 we 
underscored our discussion from the day before by providing 
Sarapinas with reftel talking points on Security, 
Reintegration, Development / Governance and International 
Civilian Coordination.  He thanked us for the information. 
We will follow up with Sarapinas when he returns from the 
London Conference to continue our important engagement on 
Lithuania's efforts in Afghanistan, including its PRT 
leadership in Ghor and its SOF mission in RC South.
