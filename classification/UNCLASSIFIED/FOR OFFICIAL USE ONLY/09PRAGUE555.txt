REF: SECSTATE 94890 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Poloffs met on September 15, 2009, with Mr. 
David Masek of the Czech MFA's UN Department to deliver the 
points outlined in reftel.  Masek assured us that, while both 
the Czech Republic and the EU seek to achieve a workable 
consensus during the IAEA General Conference -- particularly 
with an eye toward establishing a constructive atmosphere for 
next year's NPT Review Conference -- there are certain "red 
lines" that the Czechs believe must not be crossed.  Chief 
among these red lines is any action aimed at introducing the 
Arab League's Israeli Nuclear Capabilities resolution. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Masek noted Czech appreciation for New Zealand's 
efforts to build a consensus, indicating that, within the 
context of the GC President's statement, it might be possible 
to achieve a compromise satisfying Arab League 
representatives.  Ultimately, the Czechs' goal is to see a 
resolution emphasizing Middle East safeguards in the broadest 
context, as unnecessary specificity inevitably leads to 
dispute.  (Expressing what he was careful to identify as a 
personal viewpoint, Masek observed that successfully creating 
a consensus at the GC also requires a measure of flexibility 
on the part of Israel, whose proposed amendments should not 
necessarily be accepted carte blanche.)
