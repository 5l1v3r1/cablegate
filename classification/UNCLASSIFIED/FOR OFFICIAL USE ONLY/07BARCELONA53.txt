¶1. (SBU) Former Foreign Minister and Catalan Popular Party (PPC) 
leader Josep Pique resigned with immediate effect July 19, 
claiming mistreatment by the national PP.  In a letter to PP 
President Mariano Rajoy, Pique said that it had become 
impossible for him to continue working for the party after 
national leaders unleashed a series of stinging attacks against 
Catalan regional issues such as the negotiations over 
implementation of the Statute (Estatute) governing relations 
between Catalonia and Madrid.  The last straw came July 18 when 
PP Secgen Angel Acebes traveled to Barcelona and, according to 
reports, dictated a local party shake up that left Pique and his 
deputies out in the cold.  Daniel Sirera, Xavier Garcia Albiol, 
and failed mayoral candidate Alberto Fernandez all appear poised 
to vie for the party leadership position. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  The PP has never been much of a factor in 
Catalonia, and this recent turn of events will make things even 
harder for the party as it prepares for national elections 
probably next year.  The national PP has always wielded more 
control over its Catalan branch than the Socialist party has 
over its regional party, the Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSC). 
 The PSC, for example, elects its regional leadership; the PP 
names theirs from Madrid.  Pique, despite his parties poor 
showing in Catalonia is generally thought of favorably by the 
political class across the spectrum.  His party's anti-Catalan 
positions notwithstanding, he has always managed to walk that 
fine line between supporting Catalonia's regional aspirations 
while also maintaining loyalty to the nation.  The curtain has 
probably not come down on Pique's political career just yet. 
End Comment.
