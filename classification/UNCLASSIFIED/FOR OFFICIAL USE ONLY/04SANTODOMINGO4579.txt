SUBJECT: DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: DEMARCHE ON VENEZUELAN 
REFERENDUM 
 
REF: STATE 168747 
 
¶1. (SBU) On August 6 poloff delivered points para 3 reftel to 
MFA international organizations deputy director Rhadys Abreu 
de Polanco, and urged the GODR to issue a statement 
supporting a free, fair, and transparent process in the 
Venezuelan presidential referendum August 15.  Poloff also 
advocated engagement of local NGOs on the referendum issue. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Abreu de Polanco undertook to pass our request to 
Foreign Secretary Frank Guerrero Prats.  She noted, however, 
the GODR's policy of non-intervention in other nations' 
internal affairs and the need for any statement to be 
scrupulously evenhanded and based on democratic principles. 
She downplayed the possible role of any Dominican NGOs, 
claiming that -- fairly or unfairly -- they are often 
perceived has being partisan.  Poloff asked that we be 
informed of the foreign secretary's decision regarding a GODR 
statement. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The GODR will undergo a change of 
administrations on August 16, the day after the Venezuelan 
referendum.  Senior officials in the GODR, including many at 
the MFA, expect to be replaced by persons sympathetic to 
President-elect Leonel Fernandez's PLD. Some mid-rank 
officials hope to be retained by the new administration. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Relations with Caracas are sensitive because of the 
GODR's reliance on oil supplies from Venezuela.  Fernandez 
briefly visited President Chavez in June, and local press has 
reported Chavez's announced intention to attend Fernandez's 
inauguration on August 16. Under these circumstances, it is 
unlikely the outgoing administration will issue any statement 
on the referendum. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The small number of Dominican NGOs respected for 
their advocacy of democracy-related topics focus entirely on 
domestic political reforms and respect for human rights. 
They lack the mandate for international engagement.
