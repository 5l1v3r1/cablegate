SUBJECT: EGYPT RELEASES FACEBOOK ACTIVISTS 
 
REF: CAIRO 1581 
 
1.(SBU)  The fourteen members of the Facebook social 
networking group "6th of April Youth", arrested on July 23 
(reftel), have all been released.  On July 30, the GoE 
released eleven of the fourteen detained activists.  The GoE 
released the remaining three over the next several days, with 
the final detainee released on August 2.  While the 
Alexandria Court of Appeals ordered the release of the 
activists on July 27, the release was delayed for several 
days while the Public Prosecutor appealed the order, an 
appeal that was rejected. 
 
2.(SBU)  The activists were apparently released without 
charges, but the possibility remains that they could be 
charged in the future.  We will continue to follow this case 
closely.
