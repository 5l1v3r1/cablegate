NATIONAL ELECTION COMMISSION 
 
REF: NAIROBI 2066 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Over the weekend of October 2, all of the 
members of the disputed Somaliland National Election 
Commission (NEC) resigned, paving the way for the appointment 
of a new, hopefully less controversial NEC that could go some 
way in preparing the ground for the much-postponed 
presidential elections.  Kulmiye opposition party Chairman 
Ahmed Silanyo in an October 5 telephone conversation from 
Hargeisa, was cautiously optimistic that progress on 
elections could be made.  He thought that the Guurti (the 
Council of Elders) could vote on the seven new NEC members by 
as early as October 7.  Silanyo's optimism was tempered by 
memories of recent past failures to move the election process 
forward, however.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In an October 5 telephone conversation from 
Hargeisa, Somaliland, Kulimiye opposition party Chairman 
Ahmed Silanyo confirmed media accounts that all members of 
the National Election Commission (NEC) had in fact resigned 
during the weekend of October 2.  Silanyo alleged that the 
stage had been set for their resignations when President 
Riyale, opposition UCID Chairman Faisal Ali Warabe, and he 
had agreed October 3 on a framework roadmap to the elections. 
 The roadmap included a new NEC, adjustments to the voter 
registration list, cooperation between the new NEC and 
Somaliland's political parties, and NGO involvement in the 
political process. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Cascading NEC member resignations accompanied and 
followed the agreement among the three political leaders. 
Silanyo alleged that each nominating entity (the President, 
the Guurti, Silanyo, and Warabe) had identified their new 
candidates for the NEC.  He said they would be presented to 
the Guurti and possibly voted on within the next two days. 
¶4. (SBU) While acknowledging that the current outward harmony 
among the three parties could end at any moment, Silanyo was 
nevertheless cautiously optimistic that the process would go 
forward.  He thought that international pressure and a 
belated realization by all parties that Somaliland's 
precarious stability could end if the stand-off continued 
would force the parties to continue to negotiate in good 
faith. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  The end of the compromised NEC and 
Silanyo's cautious optimism are good news, although many 
difficult compromises remain to be made by all of the players 
and it is far from certain that the current good will can be 
sustained.
