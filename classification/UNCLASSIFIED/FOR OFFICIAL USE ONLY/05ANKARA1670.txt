REF: STATE 45975 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) March 18 we discussed reftel talking points with 
MFA Human Rights Department Section Head Nilvana Darama, who 
thanked us for informing the MFA about the U.S. position 
regarding the UNHCR.  Darama avoided commenting on the UNHCR 
report, but said it was up to each country to select its own 
head of delegation.  She averred that it would be better to 
improve the capacity of the CHR rather than to create new 
bodies.
