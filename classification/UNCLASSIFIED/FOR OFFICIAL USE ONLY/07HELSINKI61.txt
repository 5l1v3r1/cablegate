SUBJECT: FINNAIR CEO CONSIDERS IN-FLIGHT REFUELING FOR 
FINNISH F-18S 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Ambassador Ware called on Finnair CEO and 
President Jukka Hienonen on January 16.  Hienonen raised the 
possibility of Finnair providing in-flight refueling for 
Finland,s F-18 Hornet aircraft and mentioned Finnair,s 
focus on routes to Asia while its North America traffic 
decreases.  Hienonen also commented on the need for the 
Finnish workforce to adapt to meet the opportunities of 
globalization.  End Summary. 
 
Tanking Up With Finnair? -- Finnair Considers F-18 Refueling 
Proposal 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
(SBU) Hienonen said Finnair was considering a proposal from 
the Finnish Defense Forces (FDF) to acquire several 
multi-role aircraft that could periodically be leased to the 
FDF for in-flight refueling of its F-18 Hornet aircraft. 
Hienonen said the proposal would have to make fundamental 
business sense to be seriously considered, despite the fact 
the airline is 55.8 percent owned by the Finnish government. 
When not in use by the FDF, the aircraft would be used by 
Finnair on standard routes, possibly to carry cargo.  The 
Finnish press reports  that Finnair would acquire two to 
three multi-role aircraft, likely Airbus A330 multi-role 
tanker transport (MRTT), for in-flight refueling and to 
transport Finnish forces involved in international 
peacekeeping or humanitarian efforts. 
 
Flights to Asia Up, Flights to North America Sliding 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶3. (SBU) Hienonen commented on the rapid expansion Finnair is 
making in Asia, while at the same time stiff competition and 
transatlantic over-capacity is causing it to significantly 
reduce its flights to North America.  Hienonen said Finland 
was simply "on the wrong side of Europe" for significant 
traffic to North America, though it is on the "right side" 
for flights to Asia.  Finnair,s focus on Asia has resulted 
in double-digit yearly growth since 2005. 
 
Finnish Workforce Must Adapt To Globalization 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) Hienonen noted the need for the Finnish workforce to 
adapt to meet the opportunities of globalization and that too 
many Finns were becoming too dependent upon the government 
for support.  Hienonen believes Finland,s strong economy has 
created an environment in which many are "too well off" and 
hence they are not willing to adapt in the future. 
Assimilation of new workers in the Finnish workforce was also 
cited by Hienonen as a challenge Finland will continue to 
face. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Acquiring an in-flight refueling capability 
is an interesting consideration for the FDF, as it would 
provide their military the ability to deploy offensive 
weaponry (fighters with ground attack capability) beyond 
Finnish borders, a step that Finland has been resistant to 
take in the past.  The Finnish F-18 Hornets are already 
equipped for in-flight refueling; however, access to a 
standing tanker force would allow for continuous pilot 
certification and possible international operations in the 
future.  End comment.
