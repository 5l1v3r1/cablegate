SUBJECT: NETHERLANDS/IRAQ/UN: ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO UN 
MIDDLE RING SECURITY IN IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 17022 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) The GONL will contribute an additional USD 500,000 
toward the Iraq Distinct Entity Trust Fund as continued 
support for the "middle ring" security mission protecting 
personnel serving under the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq 
UNAMI).  MFA Policy Advisor Albert van Pabst from the 
Conflict Prevention Division said February 12 that the GONL 
strongly supports the UN's efforts in Iraq.  While this 
additional contribution is less than previously contributed 
(1.1 million USD) by the Dutch toward the Fund, van Pabst 
explained that the lower amount will allow the GONL to 
consider additional contributions next year.  Van Pabst said 
the Dutch Mission to the UN has passed news of their 
additional contribution to the UN Secretariat in New York.
