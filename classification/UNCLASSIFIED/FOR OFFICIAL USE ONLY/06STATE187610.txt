¶1. (U) This is an action reqeust.  See para. 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Embassy of Japan approached the Department to 
ask the USG for assistance in moving its diplomatic personnel 
via helicopter from Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) to 
the International Zone (IZ).  Currently, Japan enters Baghdad 
from regional locations, such as Amman, by ground transport. 
Due to the unstable security situation Japan requests to move 
by air transport.  USG strongly supports robust international 
engagement in Iraq; Japan continues to make significant 
economic and military contributions to this effort.  Actual 
flight requirements should be light, as Japan employs only a 
few people in its Embassy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy is instructed to request this transport 
assistance through appropriate military channels.  Japanese 
reimbursement can likely be handled via the U.S.-Japan 
Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement.
