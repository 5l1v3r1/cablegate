¶1. (SBU) Summary: Post requests that nonimmigrant visa eligibility 
be restored for Javier Antonio Pichardo Ramirez.  Post has confirmed 
that Pichardo Ramirez satisfactorily resolved his property dispute 
with U.S. citizen Mrs. Leyla Rener de Marin on May 24, 2006.  Please 
see action request in Paragraph 3.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On May 24, 2006, U.S. citizen Mrs. Leyla Rener de Marin 
settled her property dispute with Javier Antonio Pichardo Ramirez by 
accepting indemnification bonds issued by the Government of 
Nicaragua (GON) worth 2,348,700 cordobas (approximately $35,000). 
In June 2006, the Embassy received a copy of the settlement document 
from the GON.  On May 21, 2008, Econoff spoke to Mrs. Rener de Marin

¶3. (SBU) Action Request: Post finds sufficient evidence that the 
property dispute between Leyla Rener de Marin and Javier Antonio 
Pichardo Ramirez has been resolved.  Thus, we request the Department 
consider removing Pichardo Ramirez' visa ineligibility under Section 
¶2225.
