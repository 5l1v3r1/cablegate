¶1. (SBU) Note:  Below is the first reporting 
shared with the Embassy by the German PRT in 
Konduz.  We hope to make this a precedent, not 
only for the Germans but for the other non-US PRTs 
as well.  We are working with ISAF, as part of its 
PRT Coherence Plan to pool as much PRT reporting 
as possible, and began sharing much of our 
reporting and/our PRT Weekly months ago.  This 
reciprocity is an encouraging step.  Informal 
embassy translation follows: 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Kunduzs new police chief, 
General Sayed Ahmed Same, formerly the Chief of 
Police in Samangan Province, took office today 
(June 6).  The former COP in Kunduz, General 
Mutalib Beg, has been relieved of his duties, and 
we are not certain about any future assignment for 
him.  The hand-over took place on June 5, and was 
attended by many provincial notables and PRT 
officials.  General Same has the reputation of 
being honest and loyal to the government. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Details:  The former Chief of Police of 
Samangan, General Same, was sworn in yesterday as 
the Chief of Police of Kunduz, with surprisingly 
little advance notice, in a ceremony attended by 
by 
some 300 religious and civil provincial leaders 
from all districts of the province.  The PRT was 
represented by both civilian and military leaders. 
Former Police Chief General Mutalib Beg was given 
an honorable farewell (representatives of the 
elders and mullahs shuras gave him a rousing 
God is great chorus, which seldom is given to 
non-religious officials).  Although Mutalib for 
the time being has no onward posting, he told the 
PRT that he hoped to be nominated as governor, 
either of Kunduz or Takhar.  Mutalib is very 
influential in the region, both as Dostums man 
and as a former high-ranking mujahideen, and he 
will remain so, even without a public position. 
His successor is also Uzbek, although we do not 
know if he has close ties to Dostum.  He began his 
career in the police, but switched to the army 
during the time of Najibullah, fighting the 
Soviets, like his predecessor, as a mujahideen 
commander.  We do not (yet) know any particulars 
of his activities during the civil war and Taliban 
liban 
period.  Just three years ago, he resumed his 
police service as CoP in Samangan.  He is known in 
police circles as loyal to the government and 
apolitical.   We have no knowledge of any ties to 
opposition fighters/insurgents. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The loser in the rebalancing of the 
police leadership in Kunduz is deputy Police Chief 
General Razak, who is supposed to be reassigned as 
Deputy Police Chief in Helmand, but who is trying 
to remain in Kunduz for family reasons (his son is 
currently being treated  at the PRT hospital). 
Razak is outspokenly pro-German and, in the 
estimation of the PRT, one of the very few 
government officials in either Kunduz or Takhar 
who exhibits high professional integrity and

competence.  His departure from Kunduz will 
significantly weaken the police restructuring and 
reform in the province.  The PRT recommends that 
the (German) Embassy intervene in his favor in 
Kabul. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Analysis:   The change in the police 
leadership in Kunduz took place with little 
tle 
disruption.  In their remarks at the change-over 
ceremony, the incoming as well as the outgoing 
Police Chief expressed strong support for 
continued cooperation with the PRT on security and 
police reform issues.   General Same made a very 
promising impression.  Mutalib departed 
graciously, perhaps awaiting higher 
responsibilities; whether they will be in either 
of the German  PRT provinces (i.e., Takhar or 
Kunduz) remains to be seen.

¶6.  Embassy Comment:  The State Department PRTOff 
assigned to Konduz concurs with the German 
description of the event and the analysis.  If we 
could get regular reporting like this from all 
ISAF PRTs, it would take some of the pressure off 
of us to have DOS reps at many PRTs in the north. 
End Comment.
