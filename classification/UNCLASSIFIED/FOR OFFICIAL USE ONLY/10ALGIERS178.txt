REF: STATE 19579 
 
(SBU) Pol-Econ Chief presented reftel talking points on the 
Tehran Research Reactor to MFA Deputy Director for 
Disarmament Hamza Khelif and left them and the reftel copy of 
the joint U.S., French and Russian letter to IAEA DG Amano as 
a non-paper.  Khelif required detailed explanation of the 
relationship between the enrichment of fuel for the TRR and 
the production of medical isotopes by that same facility, but 
took on board the U.S. offer to help Iran procure such 
isotopes from third parties.  Pol-Econ Chief could not 
confirm a report Khelif said had heard about a Turkish offer 
to mediate between the U.S.-France-Russia and Iran.  He 
repeated the standard GOA position that his government 
supports the resolution of this dispute without resort to 
violence, which could destabilize the region.  Khelif 
promised to pass our points to superiors in the MFA.
