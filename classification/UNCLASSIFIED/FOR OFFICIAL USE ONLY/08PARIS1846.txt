SUBJECT: FRANCE CONSIDERING HUMAN RIGHT TO BROADBAND 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a speech set for October 13, President Sarkozy will 
announce a major policy initiative on the future of the digital 
economy that may include support for a human right to internet 
broadband access. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In discussions September 30 - October 1 with Ambassador 
David A. Gross, U.S. Coordinator for International Communications 
and Information Policy, French officials said that final 
preparations are underway for a major announcement by President 
Sarkozy planned for October 13 that will lay out France's vision for 
the next generation of the information society. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The President's initiative represents the first major 
policy input by France's State Secretary for the Digital Economy, 
Eric Besson, and this package of proposals will seek to underscore 
France's leading role in Europe on internet and digital issues. 
Sarkozy's text is being drafted by the Elysee and none of our 
contacts would guess as to its final content.  However, one concept 
they said was likely to be included was that broadband internet 
access be deemed a human right. 
 
¶4. (SBU) We provide this heads-up and will report additional details 
as we learn them, cognizant of the potential impact any new 
developments, such as the call for the creation of a human right to 
broadband internet access, may have for the U.S. and global economy.
