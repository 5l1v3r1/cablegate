(SBU) Head of the Americas' Desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA) Ussama Khachab contacted the Embassy on July 2 on behalf of 
caretaker Minister of Foreign Affairs Fawzi Salloukh.  Khachab said 
Minister Salloukh asked him to relay a verbal response for the Dip 
Note sent on March 12, 2008 to then Acting Foreign Minister Tariq 
Mitri regarding the U.S. designation of four Syria-based individuals 
affiliated with al-Qaeda.  Khachab said, "Based upon the inquiry 
made by the (Lebanese) Special Investigation Commission (SIC) for 
Fighting Money Laundering and Terrorist Finance, there are no bank 
accounts in Lebanon for the following persons:  Badran Turki 
al-Mazidih, Ghazy al-Mazidih, Akram Turki al-Mazidih and Saddah 
al-Marsumi."
