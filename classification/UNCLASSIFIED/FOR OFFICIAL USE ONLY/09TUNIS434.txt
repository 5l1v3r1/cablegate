REF: STATE 59971 
 
(SBU) In a June 29, 2009 meeting with Econ/Commercial Officer 
to discuss reftel demarche, MFA Deputy Director for the 
Multilateral Directorate of the General Directorate of 
International Organizations and Conferences (DGOCI) Nedra 
Drige and Division Chief for Economic and Technical 
Cooperation of the DGOCI Nadia Doudech noted the GOT had sent 
a delegation to Sharm El Sheikh for the 2nd Session of the 
IRENA Preparatory Commission.  However, they did not know how 
the delegation would vote on the headquarters location. 
Drige agreed choosing Abu Dhabi would send a good signal 
because it is both an OPEC country and a supporter of 
renewable energy.  (Note: Media reports late on June 29 noted 
Tunisia did, in fact, vote for Abu Dhabi.  End Note.) Both 
Drige and Doudech welcomed the focus of the United States on 
renewables and noted renewable energy was a part of the GOT's 
energy strategy.
