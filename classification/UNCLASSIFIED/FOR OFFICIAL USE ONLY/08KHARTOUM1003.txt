SUBJECT: U.S. HOST BLOCKS SUDATEL INTERNET DOMAIN NAME 
 
REF: 07-03-2008 Mulligan-Struble email 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request - see para 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In meetings with CDA Fernandez on July 6, Presidential 
Advisor Osman Ismail and the Sudanese Foreign Ministry raised 
U.S.-host company Network Solutions locking of Sudan 
Telecommunications Company's (SUDATEL) internet domain name (ref 
email).  Osman appealed for USG assistance to reverse the decision 
or allow SUDATEL to transfer its domain to a non-U.S. host.  MFA 
also provided the CDA with copies of internal email correspondence 
between SUDATEL and Network Solutions.  In a separate meeting, the 
MFA asserted to a UNAMID official that Network Solutions' action 
will cause Sudan to loose all internet access within several 
months. 
 
¶3.  (U) On April 8, SUDATEL was informed via email by Kim Gasper, 
Executive Support Specialist, Network Solutions, (tel: 
570-708-8700, email:  kgasper@networksolutions.com) that its 
internet domain name had been locked (substantive text in para. 5). 
On April 10, SUDATEL queried whether its domain register could be 
transferred to another company.  On April 11, it was informed that 
"... upon further investigation, we have been advised that the U.S. 
laws and federal regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
prevent us from unlocking the domain name for transfer." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Action request:  If true, the assertion that Sudan may 
soon loose its internet access is cause for serious concern.  Lack 
of internet access would cripple efforts to implement a number of 
key U.S. policy interests in Sudan, including CPA implementation, 
UNAMID deployment, and humanitarian assistance in Darfur. It will 
hurt private Sudanese, opposition political parties and civil 
society and could lead to GOS retaliation against the US Embassy. 
Post requests Washington guidance on how to respond to the GoS and 
to SUDATEL, and what to advise them about how to work with Network 
Solutions or another U.S. vendor in obtaining an OFAC license to 
permit SUDATEL to continue to provide internet service.  Post 
further requests that the Department and OFAC reach out to Network 
Solutions to seek to remedy this situation, or if preferred, Embassy 
Khartoum could assist Network Solutions with this process with 
guidance from the Department and OFAC.  End action request. 
 
¶5.  (U) Begin Text: 
 
Your Domain Name is locked due to OFAC (Office of Foreign Asset 
Control) rules.  I have provided a link below for your reference. 
 
The Country you reside in may be listed in the Office of Foreign 
Assets Control, therefore, due to U.S. law and federal regulations 
we are not able to process your credit card for renewals or continue 
to maintain registration of the domains that resided in your 
Account.
