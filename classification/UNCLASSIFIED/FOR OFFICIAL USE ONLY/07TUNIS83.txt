SUBJECT: LABOR PROGRAMMING NEEDS IN TUNISIA 
 
REF: STATE 200668 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post welcomes reftel's request for input on labor 
programming needs in the region.  Tunisia has a strong labor 
history pre-dating independence, and unions are active across 
all sectors and throughout Tunisia.  The General Union of 
Tunisian Workers (UGTT), the sole labor confederation, is 
well organized, relatively democratic and active 
internationally.  Labor-organized strikes are common in 
Tunisia and often lead to improved conditions.  Labor laws 
are among the strongest in the region; indeed, they are 
sometimes seen as an impediment to increased foreign and 
private investment.  Perhaps in recognition of the strength 
and activism of the Tunisian labor movement, the Labor Union 
of Arab Maghreb Workers, which is associated with the 
five-nation Arab Maghreb Union (Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, 
Tunisia and Libya), is headquartered in Tunisia. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Unfortunately, the relatively powerful Tunisian 
unions are also vocal opponents of USG policies in the 
region.  Most, if not all individuals associated with the 
UGTT have boycotted USG activities -- from meetings to 
receptions to financing -- since the Iraq war began in 2003. 
In recent weeks, union activists have publicly stressed their 
strong anti-American and pro-Saddam leanings.  While most 
labor officials boycott embassy events, those who meet with 
EmbOffs refuse to cooperate in any substantive way with the 
USG. 
 
¶3. (SBU) However, the UGTT and its associated unions enjoy a 
strong historical relationship with American unions that 
continues today.  The AFL-CIO Solidarity Center has an active 
technical cooperation program with the UGTT.  Over the past 
year, the regional Solidarity Center representative based in 
Algiers has organized several programs in Tunisia.  Given the 
local environment and in order to maximize participation, 
post strongly recommends any USG labor programming targeting 
Tunisian participants be organized under the umbrella of 
regional or international NGOs, such as the International 
Labor Organization, the International Trade Union 
Confederation and the AFL-CIO Solidarity Center. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In terms of programming, Tunisian labor activists 
have stressed their interest in improving their organization 
of and outreach to youth and women, who are underrepresented 
in many sectors' unions.  Labor is also focused on the 
impacts of globalization and the international trade 
environment, including retraining displaced workers and 
increasing competitiveness.  Post believes local unions would 
benefit from programming focusing on the benefits of free 
trade -- to workers and consumers.  Additionally, Tunisian 
unions are relatively apolitical (domestically) and thus 
could be educated on appropriate and constructive means of 
political activism, including lobbying. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post is already working with regional Solidarity 
Center representative Lorraine Clewer to organize two labor 
programs: 
 
1) A session on Labor's Role in Politics, moderated by 
Clewer, for post's monthly Human Rights Roundtable Series 
(tentatively scheduled for February), and 
 
2) A Solidarity Center regional program on Freedom of 
Expression to be hosted in Tunis in spring 2007 and 
potentially funded by a MEPI small grant.
