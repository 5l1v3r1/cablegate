¶1. Rio Radar is a regular compilation of key economic, political, 
commercial, and other developments in the states of Rio de Janeiro, 
Bahia, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, and Sergipe.  Subjects for 
16-23 October: 
 
AECIO NEVES ON PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a 20 October call on Minas Gerais Governor and possible 
PSDB presidential candidate Aecio Neves, Principal Officer asked for 
Neves' views on the state-of-play of presidential politics as Brazil 
heads into the 2010 election year.  Neves said that he and Sao Paulo 
Governor Jose Serra - the leading PSDB contender for the party's 
presidential candidate - are being careful to protect themselves, 
and to some extent each other, from overexposure and damaging 
in-fighting within the PSDB of the kind seen between Serra and 
Geraldo Alckmin in the last presidential contest.  He said both 
would maintain a collegial posture through the end of the calendar 
year, but Neves said he believed the PSDB would definitely name its 
candidate in a party meeting in January 2010.  Neves left no doubt 
that he would not wait beyond that point.  Neves also expressed 
optimism that the PSDB has a meaningful chance of winning.  Neves 
said the presumed candidate of the PT-led governing coalition, 
Presidential Chief of Staff Dilma Rousseff, is hovering steadily at 
30 percent in polling, and Neves indicated Rousseff's ability to 
rise above that number would depend more on her capacity to sell her 
candidacy to the public than on Lula's popularity or the PT machine. 
 (Comment:  Most current public polls actually show Rousseff with 
lower numbers, and it is not clear whether Neves was referring to 
internal PSDB research.  In any case, Neves seemed to imply this may 
be a decisive weakness, given Rousseff's inexperience in running for 
office.  End comment.) 
 
ONGOING FAVELA VIOLENCE 
 
¶3. (SBU) Rio police continued through the week of 19-23 October in a 
broad crack-down on the Commando Vermelho (Red Command) 
narcotrafficking gang, in the wake of intense gang violence in the 
city's favelas on 17-18 October, which produced the shocking image 
of a police helicopter being shot down by criminal gunfire (ref a). 
 The police effort is centered on 10 favelas across Rio where the 
Commando Vemelho operates, with a focus on arresting CV leaders 
responsible for the attack on the helicopter and the invasion of a 
rival gang's turf in a favela in the city's northern zone.  More 
than thirty persons have died in the current wave of violence. 
Consulate General officers are seeking a briefing with senior police 
and public security officials on the current violence and on the Rio 
government's long-term strategic favela "pacification" plan (ref b) 
for re-asserting state authority in the city's favelas, many of 
which are effectively controlled by narcotrafficking groups.  Septel 
will report on Principal Officer's visit to Dona Marta, the first 
favela considered to be successfully "pacified" under the state 
government's plan. 
POSSIBLE DISCOVERY OF 1.5 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL AT CAMPOS 
¶4. (SBU) On October 15 2009, Brazilian energy company OGX, owned by 
Brazilian multi-millionaire Eike Batista, announced the discovery of 
a major reserve of oil, located at the southern end of the Campos 
Basin in block BM-C-43.  According to OGX, the block could hold an 
estimated 1.5 billion barrels of oil.  Petrobras had explored this 
block 15 years ago, but abandoned further exploration due to studies 
that indicated low quantity oil reserves.  OBX is currently 
analyzing the quality of the oil.
