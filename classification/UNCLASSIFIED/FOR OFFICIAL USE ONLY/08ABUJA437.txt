SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SOMALIA AND PIRACY DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: SECSTATE 18101 
 
(SBU) On March 4, Poloff delivered reftel demarche to 
Ambassador Charles Ononye, Deputy Director of the 
International Organizations Department of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  Ambassador Ononye agreed on the need for 
international aid to Somalia in its fight against piracy, but 
believed that the steps described in reftel might be 
premature given "the total absence of effective Somali 
government."  Nevertheless, Ambassador Ononye promised to 
report any substantive response the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs might have, though none is expected.
