REF: ANKARA 278 
 
¶1. (U) On February 27, the Ministry of Finance ended the collection 
of additional value-added (VAT) tax levied on Free Trade Zones 
(FTZs) operating in Turkey.  Companies operating in FTZs were 
blindsided by a Turkish Customs Undersecretariat circular issued on 
January 21 (Reftel) requiring them to pay VAT on goods used for 
investment, consumption or internal use.  This surprise change 
substantially increased production costs for these companies and had 
many contemplating leaving Turkey. 
 
¶2. (U) According to media reports, the Finance Ministry's letter to 
Customs stated that all goods delivered to FTZs shall benefit from 
VAT exemptions.  This directive by the Ministry not only lifted the 
additional taxes, but also simplified the process through which 
these goods gain VAT exemption.  Now, instead of listing the items 
in the customs declaration, the companies can fill in a form to 
receive tax exemption. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While companies operating in FTZs were pleased with the 
Ministry's intervention, they called for an amendment to the 
legislation allowing such collections to ensure that the Customs 
Administration cannot begin assessing these taxes again in the 
future.  Such a change, they argued, would help renew investor 
confidence.  "Only then can the GOT ensure sustained productivity in 
FTZs, which have annual trading volume of $24 billion," said a 
sector representative. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  The Finance Ministry's intervention is a welcome 
step in restoring investor confidence.  However, the fact that the 
Customs Administration surprised other Turkish government agencies, 
including reportedly the Prime Minister, with their decision to 
begin assessing this tax emphasizes the need for the Turkish 
government to streamline its tax code and amend conflicting 
legislation.  End comment.
