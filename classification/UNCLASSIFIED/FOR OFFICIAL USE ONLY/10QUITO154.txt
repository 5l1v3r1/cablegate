Ecuador's Central Bank Postpones Release of Third Quarter Results 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
-------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Central Bank (BCE), which normally publishes third 
quarter results in late December each year, has announced it will 
not release third quarter 2009 results for the foreseeable future. 
The BCE maintains that the delay is due to re-calculation of GDP 
figures in accordance with a request from President Correa.  In his 
October 2, 2009 weekly radio address, Correa said IMF-imposed 
methodologies for calculating national accounts skew GDP results. 
In particular, he has commented about the need to calculate in a 
different way the contribution to GDP of Ecuador's petroleum 
refining sector.  In the past, the refined petroleum sector has 
been recorded in GDP calculations with a negative value-added due 
to the substantial subsidies the government provides for purchase 
of diesel, gasoline and natural gas.   Several analysts have 
suggested the BCE is delaying release of the figures because third 
quarter results show poor economic performance during the period. 
They have voiced concern that the delay would allow the BCE to 
alter the figures to the point that they would not be reliable, and 
claim that uncertainty over government reporting of economic 
statistics is deterring investment.  The BCE has stated that 
Ecuador's GDP grew by 0.98% in 2009, while the IMF has estimated a 
1.0% contraction, and the Economic Commission of Latin America and 
the Caribbean (CEPAL) has estimated a contraction of 0.4%.

Banks Healthy and Liquid, but Profits Decrease in 2009 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------------

¶3. (SBU) Profits for Ecuador's banking sector, which is comprised 
of 25 banks, 24 of which are private, declined from $283 million in 
2008 to $217.6 million in 2009.  Although banking deposits grew by 
8.3% over the same period, loan rates declined, increasing 
liquidity in the sector.  In 2009, limits on fees and lending rates 
imposed by the GoE further limited bank earnings.  Profits declined 
at 16 banks, remained stable at one, and increased at only seven 
banks: Guayaquil, Procredit, Unibanco, Capital, Solidario, 
Comercial Manabi, Litoral and Delbank.  Bank representatives have 
told Emboffs that while the banks have sought to increase their 
loan portfolios in 2009, they simply couldn't find a sufficient 
 
number of customers.  Private companies have confirmed this, 
stating that they are investing retained earnings and paying down 
debt, but holding off on large investments that would require 
taking on credit.  The BCE recently announced a further 2.62% 
reduction in interest lending rates effective January 29, 2010, 
that will likely limit further profit margins.  Despite declining 
profits and recent reductions in lending rate ceilings, several 
analysts continue to describe the banking sector as healthy, noting 
that productivity gains have mitigated the effects of decreased 
interest revenues and fees.

Drought Affects Water Supply, Food Prices 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ecuador's worst drought in five years has caused food 
supply problems in the country's northern province of Pichincha, 
which includes Quito.  The rainy season, which usually lasts from 
October through May, has yet to arrive in force.  Pichincha 
recorded less than 0.2 inches of rainfall in January 2010, where 
average January rainfall is three inches.  Despite rumors of 
potential water rationing in Quito, no restrictions have yet 
occurred or been announced.  Quito's water authority, La Empresa 
Metropolitana de Alcantarillado y Agua Potable de Quito (EMAAP-Q), 
announced on January 8, 2010, that it was sufficiently prepared for 
the water shortage and that it would not need to resort to 
restrictions.  Other locations are not as fortunate, however, and 
on February 6, president Correa announced a state of emergency for 
the central Ecuadorian provinces that have been affected by the 
drought.  Guayllabamba, a town of roughly 13,000 near Quito, has 
shut off water access for two hours per day since January 18th. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The drought has caused difficulty in agricultural areas. 
Low harvests throughout Pichincha province have caused prices on 
several locally grown products for domestic consumption to increase 
significantly over the last 30 days. Between December 2009 and 
January 2010, the price of beans and potatoes jumped 25% and 27% 
respectively, while naranjilla (an orange variant) and avocado 
prices increased 50% and pea prices increased 70%.

Unparalleled Biodiversity in Yasuni National Forest 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- 
 
 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) A team of researchers from several U.S. and Ecuadorian 
universities recently concluded that the Yasuni National Forest - a 
protected reserve near the northeastern rim of Ecuador covering 
some 3,800 square miles, comparable to the size of Hawaii's largest 
island - contains the highest level of biodiversity in South 
America and possibly the world.  Every 2.5 acres contains roughly 
655 tree species and an incredible 100,000 insect species. 
Scientists have also counted 596 bird species, and 150 amphibian 
species in Yasuni.  These record breaking numbers exceed the 
biodiversity of the United States and Canada combined.  Unlike the 
eastern Amazon, climate change models predict that Yasuni will 
remain wet and hot, providing a stable environment for its rich 
biodiversity. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The park is also home to the Huaorani indigenous people, 
population roughly 4,000, and an oil reserve estimated at 850 
million barrels.  Given that the National Forest is a valuable 
resource for oil and environmental interests alike, the GOE has 
mooted compensation from the international community at  $350 
million per year in return for protecting the 
Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) oil block portion of the forest 
from exploitation.  The future of this deal is uncertain since the 
GOE has so far failed to attract sufficient donors (reftel).

Guayaquil Ethanol Pilot Program Begins 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) On January 12, 2009, the GOE kicked off Ecopais, a program 
that adds a 5% share of ethanol to gasoline sold in Guayaquil. The 
coastal city is Ecuador's largest city, and is being used as a 
pilot to eventually bring a gasoline-ethanol blend to the entire 
country.  Ethanol for the program is derived exclusively from 
domestic sugarcane and is mixed with gasoline at a 
recently-completed state-owned fuel terminal just north of 
Guayaquil.  Based on the city's 5,830 barrel per day demand for 
gasoline, domestic producers are expected to provide 46,345 liters 
of ethanol per day. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Officials from the Ministry of Non-Renewable Natural 
Resources hope the plan will generate employment in rural areas, 
reduce greenhouse and toxic emissions, and diversify Ecuador's 
energy supply. The Ministry estimates that the plan will allow 
Ecuador to import 320,000 fewer barrels of gasoline per year and 
save $32 million. The Ministry has not provided estimates on the 
cost of the ethanol program.
