SUBJECT: PARAGUAY ON CABRAL INSTRUCTIONS 
 
REF: CABRAL INSTRUCTIONS EMAILED 11/23/05 
 
¶1. (SBU) On 11/25, Charge delivered ref message to Acting FM 
Gimenez in FM Rachid's absence.  Charge noted that he 
previously delivered the message to VP Castiglioni and 
Presidential Advisor Walde and spoke to FM Rachid by phone, 
and that the Department had delivered the message to 
Ambassador Spalding in Washington. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Gimenez told Charge that he would forward the 
message to Rachid and others within the GOP, but noted that 
the MFA was not in the driver's seat on the issue.  He 
intitially was very serious and said he had no other 
response.  After a brief pause, however, he lamented that the 
USG did not focus more on the positive steps the GOP has 
taken in the fight against illicit narcotics and other 
issues, and laughingly cautioned that cutting support could 
force the GOP "into the arms of the axis of evil" for 
economic and political support.  He noted that Cuba and 
Venezuela have offered considerable assistance in numerous 
areas, which the GOP has declined to accept.  He added that 
the USG provides "less support to Paraguay than to other 
countries" and Paraguay needs assistance in all areas. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Charge responded that, throughout Ambassador Keane's 
tenure, the USG focused heavily on the positive steps the GOP 
has taken, but that the attempt to promote Cabral and his 
subsequent reassignment crossed red lines for the U.S. and 
suggested that the GOP misunderstood our position, something 
we hoped to correct.  Charge explained that the USG wants to 
support reform in Paraguay, but that the Cabral issue raised 
doubts about GOP political will to fight corruption.  Charge 
concluded that he would consult with Ambassador Cason and 
other officials next week in Washington and speak to the FM 
and VP again upon his return.
