REF: STATE 28300 
 
This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 2. 
 
¶1. (SBU) OES DAS Jeff Miotke deivered the reftel Non-Paper 
to Paul Weissenberg, EU Commission Director for Aerospace, 
Defense, and Security Industry in DG Enterprise, on March 25. 
 Weissenberg told DAS Miotke that he was pleased with the 
Non-Paper because it was "NATO light" and because it proposed 
to expand space security cooperation.  He emphasized that 
this cooperation cannot proceed with the Commission working 
through NATO, but might work with NATO.  He noted that he has 
more interaction with the Pentagon across the Atlantic than 
he does with NATO officials from across town.  EU political 
leadership insists that SSA and other security cooperation 
proceed as part of the growing European defense identity. 
 
¶2. USEU EconOff subsequently delivered the Non-Paper to 
Helene-Diane Dage in DG Enterprise and Jan Ahladeff, Head of 
Section in the EU Council General Secretariat's DG E VIII for 
Defense Issues.  Both Dage and Ahladeff appreciated the 
Non-Paper and U.S. interests to expand space security 
cooperation.  Neither Dage nor Ahladeff provided much 
substantive feedback.  Ahladeff also commented that the paper 
was NATO light and explained that he and his DG have close 
working relationships with Weissenberg and his security team, 
including Dage. Dage said that she will come back with 
further questions.  She also expressed the Commission's 
interest in further details on the Iridium-Russian satellite 
collision.  Action request:  Post requests the Department 
forward guidance and further information for delivery to the 
Commission and Council on this issue.
