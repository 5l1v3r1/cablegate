TARIFFS, NEW ENERGY PROJECTS 
 
 
¶1.  (U) The following is a weekly economic update for Ecuador that 
reports notable developments that are not reported by individual 
cables. 
 
ICSID Tribunal Denies Provisional Measures for Oxy 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. (U) On August 21, a World Bank arbitration panel denied granting 
provisional measures to Occidental Petroleum (Oxy) in its 
arbitration case against Ecuador for the May 2006 seizure of its 
petroleum operations.  The Ecuadorian Attorney General characterized 
the decision as "great news" for Ecuador, although it was not 
unexpected.  Among the denied provisional measures was a request for 
Ecuador to continue with Oxy's investment schedule and for a new 
joint committee of GOE and Oxy managers to oversee operations of 
Oxy's former block. The Attorney General is expected to announce 
shortly the selection of the law firm that will represent the GOE in 
the next phase of the arbitration process.  Two U.S. firms and one 
European firm are competing for the job. 
 
GOE to Lower Tariffs on Inputs 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) The GOE announced August 21 that tariffs on 1,957 products 
(raw materials, inputs, and capital goods) will be reduced, as part 
of a new policy to help industry and combat rising prices.  Minister 
for Coordination of Economic Policy and Production Mauricio Davalos 
presented the new policy to members of the Council on Foreign Trade 
and Investment (Comexi), who unanimously expressed their support. 
Tariffs for covered goods will be reduced from 5-20 percent to 0-5 
percent.  As an effort to help maintain bread prices in the face of 
rapidly rising international wheat flour prices, the tariff on this 
input will fall from 20 percent to zero.  However, one well-known 
trade observer suggested that reducing the tariff for flour was a 
political maneuver aimed at Alvaro Noboa, Ecuador's largest miller, 
largest banana exporter and frequent presidential candidate. 
 
New Energy Projects 
------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The technical committee of the FEISEH petroleum fund for 
energy sector projects (financed by revenues from Oxy's former Block 
15) approved studies for funding for four hydroelectric projects. 
The projects are projected to provide additional installed power of 
2,175 megawatts, which would represent 64 percent of current energy 
demand.  However, the plants are not expected to be completed for a 
number of years.  Minister of Electricity Alecksey Mosquera noted 
the GOE will also seek other investment in the projects. 
 
¶5.  (U) Venezuela plans to rent two drilling rigs to Ecuador to 
facilitate oil production. Minister of Petroleum and Mines Galo 
Chiriboga claims this will increase Ecuador's petroleum production 
by 10,000 barrels per day.
