¶1. (SBU) Fifteen armed men stole an estimated R100 million 
($16 million) in foreign currency, mostly U.S. dollars, from 
a South African Airways passenger plane at Johannesburg 
International Airport (JIA) on March 25.  No shots were 
fired.  The heist, which police suspect was an inside job, 
follows similar thefts at the airport of gold, platinum, 
diamonds, and cash during the past four years.  Police 
arrested five suspects - two foreign nationals and three 
senior airport managers.  In the wake of the most recent 
heist, Transport Minister Radebe defended the safety of South 
African airports and promised another review of security 
measures. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 25 at 10 a.m., two men armed with AK-47s 
overwhelmed and disarmed guards unloading an estimated R100 
million ($16 million) in foreign currency, including $11.5 
million, from a South African Airways jet that had just 
arrived from London.  Meanwhile, other members of the gang 
held up guards at airport gates.  No shots were fired and the 
men got away.  Reuben Pillay, Assistant Manager of Aviation 
Security for ACSA (Airports Company South Africa), later told 
Econoff that the thieves waited until passengers had deplaned 
before commencing their attack.  National police spokesperson 
Senior Superintendent Vishnu Naidoo said that the police 
suspected an inside job.  Pillay told Econoff that the gang 
somehow managed to obtain official airport security badges 
that allowed them access to restricted areas. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Within a few hours of the robbery, police arrested 
two foreign nationals at the Beitbridge border post with 
Zimbabwe.  Police recovered $200,000 in cash, weapons, and 
ammunition.  Three days after the heist, police arrested 
three senior ACSA managers: Duty Managers Nazir Ismail and 
Rookaya Ibrahim, and Bird and Wildlife Officer Seqan 
Soobramoney.  Naidoo said the suspects face possible charges 
of armed robbery and charges related to contravening the 
Aviation Act.  ACSA suspended the three arrested managers who 
allegedly had access to restricted zones at the airport. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Following a similar heist of gold, diamonds, and 
platinum from a KLM aircraft in September 2004, Minister of 
Transport Jeffrey Radebe announced a R100 million plan to 
upgrade security at airports nationwide. Part of the security 
upgrade involved the installation of closed circuit 
surveillance cameras.  When Econoff toured JIA in December 
2005, ACSA had installed the cameras but had not yet hired 
the staff to monitor them.  The upgrade included creating an 
executive security position at South Africa's Civil Aviation 
Authority (CAA), but that position remains vacant.  High 
staff turnover plagues the CAA which has been without a CEO 
for three years. Mr. Zakes Myeza, formerly Executive Director 
at the Johannesburg Development Agency, will fill that 
position in April. Radebe's spokesperson, Collen Msibi, 
announced that Radebe had appointed an interagency committee 
to assess the airport's security situation. In the wake of 
the most recent heist, Radebe defended the safety of property 
and customers at ACSA run airports.  On March 31, ACSA 
spokesperson Solomon Makgale announced that ACSA has decided 
not to renew the contracts for two firms responsible for 
security at the airport and has appointed two others in their 
place.  Makagle said the nonrenewal of the contracts was 
coincidental and not linked to the recent robbery. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Paul O'Sullivan, ACSA's former head of airport 
security, shares the contention by police that the heist was 
an inside job.  O'Sullivan claims that while he was head of 
security he uncovered a criminal syndicate at the airport 
which included police, customs, immigration and security 
officials, as well as cleaning staff, baggage handlers, and 
airline staff.  He says that he was close to unraveling the 
syndicate when he was dismissed by ACSA in 2003 for 
"irreconcilable differences." O'Sullivan is suing ACSA for 
$20 million for defamation of character. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Airline executives from Delta and South African 
Airways as well as the CEO of the South African Board of 
Airline Representatives have complained to Econoff about 
 
PRETORIA 00001313  002 OF 002 
 
 
problems with airport security, particularly luggage 
pilferage which is becoming widespread.  The Embassy has also 
become increasingly aware of this problem.  In March 2006, 
for example, the Embassy received a report that every bag 
belonging to a group of seven conferees flying out of JIA to 
attend an AID-sponsored event was pilfered.  South African 
Airlines reported that in 2005 it received between 30 and 50 
reports of luggage pilferage each day, costing the airline 
R40 million ($6.4 million) per year.  Airline executives told 
Econoff that in their opinion airport officials have quickly 
tightened security in advance of Federal Aviation 
Administration or Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) visits and then relaxed it after the inspectors leave. 
JIA security fared well in a February 2005 TSA visit.
