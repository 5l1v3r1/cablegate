SUBJECT: APRIL 24-25 ISLAMABAD REGIONAL ECONOMIC 
COOPERATION CONFERENCE ON AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: (A) STATE 25526 (B) HOLMAN-DEUTSCH EMAIL 3/10/0 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para six. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  As per reftel request, post approached the Economic 
Affairs Division of the Ministry of Finance regarding 
preparations 
for the Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on 
Afghanistan 
(RECC). Joint Additional Secretary Sohail Rehan told Econoffs 
that 
the Government of Pakistan was still seeking Government of 
Afghanistan concurrence on the joint invitation letter, which 
is 
currently in Kabul awaiting signature by the Minister of 
Foreign 
Affairs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The invitation letter has reportedly been in Foreign 
Ministry in Kabul for two weeks.  Invitations to delegates and 
further preparations will follow the issuance of this letter. 
There 
have been no additional substantive preparations, and our GOP 
contacts are rather frustrated that issuance of the letter is 
holding up further preparations.  The papers for the 
conference are 
being prepared by the World Bank and Asian Development Bank 
in Kabul 
and should be ready for circulation the first week in April. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The GOP objectives for the conference include: 
 
-- urge development partners to sustain and strengthen their 
development assistance to ensure peace, security, and regional 
development; 
--  obtain financial, technical, and other assistance form the 
international community for Afghanistan's rehabilitation and 
reconstruction, focusing on the human, natural and physical 
infrastructure; and 
-- obtain international assistance for creating linkages and 
devising strategies for agriculture, energy resources, trade 
and 
transport between Afghanistan and other states in the region. 
 
To further these objectives, the conference will have working 
groups 
focused on infrastructure, health, labor movement and human 
resource 
development, and overland trade and transit combined with the 
Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline.  The GOP 
encourages participating governments to send experts in these 
areas. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post is reserving a block of rooms at the Serena 
Hotel, as 
per reftel. Post contact for this conference is Deputy 
Counselor for 
Economic and Commercial Affairs Mary Beth Goodman, who can be 
reached at goodmanmb@state.gov. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Embassy Islamabad requests that posts and Washington 
agencies intending to send delegates to this conference 
notify post 
soonest via email or cable.
