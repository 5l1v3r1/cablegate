SUBJECT:  CIVILIAN COMPONENT OF PRT FARAH JOINS REGIONAL COMMAND 
SOUTH (RC-S) 
 
Ref:  Kabul 2102 
¶1.  (SBU) Reftel set forth the roles and responsibilities of the 
Senior Civilian Representative (SCR) positions in Regional Command 
East (RC-E) and Regional Command South (RC-S).   In particular, the 
SCRs are responsible for coordinating the work of all USG civilians 
under Chief of Mission authority within their designated region, 
ensuring coherence of political direction and developmental efforts, 
and serving as the civilian counterpart to the military commander in 
the Regional Command.  The SCRs are also responsible for 
strengthening unity of effort and ensuring civilians in their region 
receive appropriate guidance and support. 
¶2.  (SBU) Effective September 2, 2009, the civilian component of PRT 
Farah became part of the Regional Command-South (RC-South)area of 
responsibility.  All USG civilians under Chief of Mission authority 
at PRT Farah now report to SCR-S, through their chain of command. 
PRT Farah civilians will work with SCR-S and his staff to implement 
this change, including with respect to establishment of supervisory 
relationships, a lead civilian, work requirement statements and 
SOPs. 
¶3.  (SBU) The purpose of this change is to strengthen civilian unity 
of effort between PRT Farah and RC-South.  It also takes into 
account that Farah shares more common security, development and good 
governance challenges with the provinces of RC-S than with Herat. 
The change also will ensure PRT Farah receives necessary support and 
guidance, especially as USG personnel at PRT Herat are required to 
dedicate more time and resources to establishing Consulate Herat. 
Shifting the civilian component of PRT Farah to RC-South's AOR is 
not intended in any way to affect PRT Farah's military component, 
which continues to report to RC-West. 
¶4.  (SBU) SCR-South, PRT-Farah, PRT-Heart, and ISAF have cleared 
this message.
