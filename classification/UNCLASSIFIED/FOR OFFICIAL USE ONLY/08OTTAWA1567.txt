¶1. (SBU)  According to Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Deputy Director for Human Rights Victoria 
Berry and Policy Officer for Human Rights Daniel Ulmer, the 
Canadian government will soon submit a 20 page report for the 
Human Rights Council's February 3rd Universal Periodic Review 
(UPR) of Canada.  Berry explained that Canada's October 14 
federal election had delayed its official submission to the 
UPR.  Canada plans to hold six nationwide engagement 
consultation meetings with NGO stakeholders to prepare the 
government for its February appearance at the UPR Fourth 
Session in Geneva.  The meetings will take place in 
Vancouver, Winnipeg, Halifax, Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto. 
The Department of Canadian Heritage, which has federal 
responsibility for promoting a greater understanding of human 
rights and reporting to the UN on the implementation of human 
rights instruments, will be the government's lead agency in 
the meetings.  Berry added that the Deputy Minister of 
Justice will likely head the Canadian delegation to Geneva. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Secretary General of Amnesty International 
Canada confirmed to poloff that his NGO had made a submission 
on Canada, and noted that it was especially critical of the 
government's performance regarding aboriginal peoples.  He 
also expressed dissatisfaction about the tardiness of and 
lack of consultations so far on the government's submission. 
 
¶3. (U)  According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights' (OHCHR) website, 50 Canadian stakeholders 
have already submitted reports for Canada's UPR, including 49 
NGOs as well as the Canadian Human Rights Commission, an 
independent national body.
