SUBJECT: SIERRA LEONE CONVICTS ARRIVE 
 
REF: FREETOWN 348 (NOTAL) 
 
1.(SBU) SUMMARY: On November 1, eight convicts from the 
Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) arrived at Mpanga 
prison in southern Rwanda where they will serve their 
sentences, ranging from 15 to 52 years, for crimes committed 
during Sierra Leone's civil war. Their arrival brings renewed 
energy to calls for International Criminal Tribunal for 
Rwanda (ICTR) convicts to serve their sentences in Rwanda. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The SCSL and the Government of Rwanda (GOR) in March 
signed an agreement allowing SCSL convicts to serve their 
prison terms in Rwanda for crimes committed during Sierra 
Leone's civil war. The prisoners are some of the most 
high-level leaders of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) 
rebel movement and perpetrators of war crimes and crimes 
against humanity including rape, murder, conscription of 
child soldiers, and taking of "bush brides." 
 
¶3. (SBU) On October 16, DCM and Emboff accompanied 
representatives from SCSL to Mpanga prison to assess prison 
conditions and readiness for the prisoner transfer. The 
special ward, which the GOR constructed with assistance from 
the Dutch Embassy, can house 27 high-level prisoners. The 
facility meets international standards for treatment of 
prisoners convicted by international tribunals and includes 
cable TV, internet access, self-contained cells, and a large 
recreational area. During the visit, SCSL representatives 
made several recommendations, including the addition of bars 
to the airflow space above cell doors. One representative 
commented that the convicts did not want to come to Rwanda, 
and some had threatened suicide rather than leave Sierra 
Leone. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On October 31, Emboff met with a representative of 
SCSL after a follow-up visit to the Mpanga prison. The 
representative reported that the GOR had implemented all 
recommendations from the previous visit and the ward was 
ready to receive the transfers, commenting that it was better 
than any facility in Sierra Leone. She said authorities in 
Sierra Leone had thoroughly briefed the convicts on their 
transfer to Rwanda, and that the prisoners, having had ample 
time to say good-bye to their families, were now resigned to 
the decision. On October 31, SCSL chartered a MONUC flight to 
transport the eight convicts, 16 escorts, and one supervisor 
to Kigali. The plane landed around 11pm and authorities 
transferred the prisoners to Mpanga on November 1 after 
spending the night in the central prison. Two SCSL 
representatives will remain in Mpanga for one week to ensure 
a smooth transfer (Comment: Rwandan prison guards, used to 
dealing with relatively docile Rwandan prisoners, may have 
difficulty managing the Sierr 
a Leonean prisoners, who are reported to be less responsive 
to authority. End Comment.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) SCSL representatives plan to make a follow-up visit 
to Mpanga in three months, and possibly again in six months. 
With the SCSL winding down, there have been discussions 
around establishing a small secretariat based in The Hague to 
deal with any residual issues and possibly to make regular 
reports. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: The speed at which the GOR implemented the 
SCSL's recommendations reflects its own desire to have the 
ICTR as well as other countries transfer to Rwanda 
individuals convicted or suspected of involvement in the 1994 
genocide. END COMMENT.
