SUBJECT: MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF FIRED, REFORM PROGRESSING 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On April 24 Medvedev dismissed the 63-year old 
Chief of the GRU, General Valentin Korabelnikov.  No official reason 
was given for the dismissal, but experts told us Korabelnikov's 
impending dismissal had been rumored for months.  Korabelnikov was 
known to be a Soviet-style general who focused the GRU's efforts at 
countering the perceived threat from NATO, rather than terrorists, 
separatists, and other, more germane threats to Russia.  As a 
result, the GRU performed poorly during the August 2008 conflict in 
Georgia.  Korabelnikov also publicly opposed Serdyukov's proposed 
military reforms, although the experts said this was at best a 
secondary reason for his dismissal.  Not much is known about 
Korabelnikov's replacement, Aleksandr Shlyakhturov, other than he is 
a career intelligence officer.  Experts downplay the possible 
effects of Korabelnikov's dismissal on military reform, which took 
another step forward with the dismissal of 50 generals and colonels 
who failed a basic skills test.  End Summary.

"Soviet-Style" GRU Chief Fired 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 24 Medvedev dismissed Army General Valentin 
Korabelnikov from the position of Chief of Russia's military 
intelligence agency, the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), and 
Deputy Chief of the General Staff.  Korabelnikov's deputy, 
Lieutenant General Aleksandr Shlyakhturov took his place. 
Korabelnikov received an honorable discharge and was awarded the 
Order of Service to the Fatherland, Third Class.  Some experts 
believe he will receive a civilian job in the GOR, perhaps in the 
Security Council. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While the Kremlin offered no official explanation for the 
dismissal, the experts told us there have been rumors of 
Korabelnikov's dismissal circulating for months.  Deputy 
Editor-In-Chief of the Yezhednievniy Zhurnal Aleksandr Golts told us 
that the GOR wanted more modern thinking in the military leadership. 
 Korabelnikov was a very Soviet-style general, Golts said, and 
focused the GRU's efforts on combating the perceived threat from 
NATO.  Under Korabelnikov, he said, the GRU spent little time 
focusing on Russia's real threats, such as Islamic fundamentalists, 
separatists, terrorists, and the Georgian army. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Korabelnikov's outmoded thinking was blamed for the GRU's 
disappointing performance during the August 2008 conflict in 
Georgia, the experts said.  For example, the GRU had little 
knowledge of Georgia's air defense systems, and several Russian 
planes were downed as a result.  The GRU also did a poor job 
collecting signals intelligence. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Opposition to Military Reforms Not Decisive Factor 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5. (SBU) While Korabelnikov opposed many of Serdyukov's proposed 
military reforms, and even published his criticisms in a report, 
experts maintained this was not the main reason for his dismissal. 
His dissenting views, however, did not endear him to GOR leadership. 
 In a classic turf battle, Korabelnikov and other top GRU officials 
openly criticized proposals that would have placed GRU special 
forces brigades under district commands.  There was also talk of 
placing GRU signals intelligence systems under the command of the 
Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).  Some even talked of liquidating 
the GRU and folding all of its assets into the SVR. 
 
¶6. (U) Local press also pointed out that Korabelnikov is 63 years 
old, three years older than the mandatory retirement age for 
military officers.  (N.B. For a soldier to remain in service after 
the age of 60, the President must sign a decree to extend his 
contract.) 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Shlyakhturov Likely a Temporary Replacement 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Little is known about the 62-year old Shlyakhturov, other 
than he is a career intelligence operative.  Experts believe that he 
is most likely a temporary replacement; Medvedev is expected to name 
someone else to head the GRU within a few months' time. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Korabelnikov's Firing Not a Victory for Military Reform 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Experts have downplayed the effect Korabelnikov's firing 
will have on Serdyukov's military reforms, which at any rate appear 
to be slowly moving forward.  On April 28, the MOD Examination 
 
MOSCOW 00001144  002 OF 002 
 
 
Committee tested 249 generals and colonels who occupy flag-officer 
positions on basic military skills such as strategy and tactics, 
weapons proficiency, and physical fitness.  Fifty of those tested 
will be dismissed from service due to their poor exam results.  One 
hundred thirty-three high-ranking officers will be rotated out of 
their positions in Moscow to units in Russia's provinces, where the 
cost of maintaining them will be significantly less.  Only 66 will 
keep their current Moscow-based positions.  Deputy Defense Minister 
Nikolay Pankov said these cuts were part of the MOD's plans to 
discharge 36-37,000 military officers in 2009.
