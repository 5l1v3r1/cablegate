¶1. (SBU) On September 5, protests held by secondary school students 
mobilized by the government in opposition to a UN peacekeeping 
operation in Darfur resulted in several incidents of stoning and 
vandalism of international organization and NGO guesthouses, 
offices, and vehicles, including OCHA, Tearfund, IRC, MSF, IMC, NRC, 
and MDM.  No serious destruction or injuries have so far been 
reported, although a guard was hit by a stone at an NRC guesthouse 
and several NGOs sustained broken windows. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The attacks, which followed a September 4 mobilization 
campaign through vehicle-based speaker systems, conveyed through 
markets and neighborhoods, also involved a break-in at the Tearfund 
office.  Preliminary reports indicate that some parents kept 
children home in order to prevent their being drafted into 
participating in the protests.  Reports indicate that police 
responded and chased crowd away from OCHA and ICRC.
