¶1.  (U)  Post shared refs A and B points September 13 with 
new MFA Deputy Chief for CFSP Emmanuel Cohet, Lebanon points 
with desk officer for Lebanon Remy Bouallegue, 
Israel-Palestinian points with DAS-equivalent Herve 
Besancenot, Iraq points with desk officer for Iraq Bernard 
Chappedelaine, and Iran points with Political Director 
Laboulaye's office and FM Douste-Blazy's Cabinet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Our contacts uniformly welcomed the points, which 
they said were useful and would be studied with great 
interest.  They told us September 14 that were not in a 
position to offer substantive comments, however, given the 
press of business in preparing for the meetings that would 
commence that same day.
