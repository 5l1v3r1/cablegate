-- EL-OP received the 8 connectors in November 2005, and they 
are in its possession. 
 
-- The connectors are to be installed in electronic boxes of 
reconnaissance cameras to be used by the Indian Air Force on 
Su-30 aircraft.  Supply of the cameras is expected to start 
by December 2007. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Rami Yungman
