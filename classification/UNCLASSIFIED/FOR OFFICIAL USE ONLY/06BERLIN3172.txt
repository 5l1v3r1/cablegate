        AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per ref A request, emboffs contacted the management 
offices of the Eurojet consortium in Hallbergmoss, Germany to 
confirm receipt of aircraft spare parts (transducer sets) 
made by U.S. company Endevco.  According to the license 
application, the transducers are intended for use in EJ200 
jet engines for Eurofighter Typhoon jets.  Chris Harris, the 
head of Eurojet's production department, told emboffs the 
transducers covered under license 05-931065 were shipped by 
Endevco to Industria de Turbo Propulsores (ITP) in Spain. 
(NOTE:  ITP is a member of the Eurojet consortium.  The other 
members are UK's Rolls Royce, Germany's Daimler Chrysler 
Aerospace, and Italy's Avio Spa.  END NOTE.)  Harris 
confirmed ITP is responsible for distributing the transducer 
sets to consortium members, who in turn install the 
transducers in EJ200 engines and subsequently build the 
engines into Eurofighters.  Harris noted ITP itself uses some 
transducers to produce EJ200 enginges.  Harris said ITP 
maintains records (by serial number) of transducers it has 
received and redistributed to consortium members, but 
consortium members do not necessarily track transducers after 
they have been installed in EJ200 engines. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Harris noted that NATO's EF2000 and Tornado 
Development Production and Logistics Management Agency 
(NETMA) -- not/not Eurojet -- is the actual end-user of the 
transducer sets.  Harris explained Eurojet is building the 
jet engines under a government contract with Italy, Germany, 
Spain, and the UK.  While most EJ200 engines are built 
directly into Eurofighters, Harris said, some engines are 
held as spares at military facilities in each of the four 
countries. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ref B reports ITP has provided Embassy Madrid with 
detailed spreadsheets documenting receipt and redistribution 
of the transducers.  Post understands PM/DDTC has closed this 
case and no further action is required (ref C).
