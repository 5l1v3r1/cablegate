SUBJECT: SLOVAKIA: ATTENDANCE AT PARIS DONORS CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 163955 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Slovakia will be represented at the Paris Donors 
Conference by the Slovak Ambassador to Paris, Jan Kuderjavy. 
Unfortunately, Foreign Minister Kubis has long-standing plans 
to be in the U.S. at the time of the conference.  MFA State 
Secretaries Algerova and Strofova also have scheduling 
 
SIPDIS 
conflicts.  Marian Tomasik, Director of the Middle East, 
Africa and Asia Department, told PolEcon Chief on December 12 
that the MFA is making the case within the GOS for a national 
pledge in support of the Palestinians.  Although Slovakia 
will not be in a position to make a national commitment on 
December 17, Tomasik hopes it may be able to do so early next 
year. (Comment: Tomasik did not seem entirely confident that 
the MFA recommendation would prevail, but post will continue 
to press GOS interlocutors on the need to show concrete 
support for the Palestinians at this critical time. End 
Comment.)
