SUBJECT: Extreme Weather Affects Traffic on Afghan-Tajik Bridge 
 
REF: 07 Kabul 4142 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Since December 18, 2007, the Afghan-Tajik Bridge 
has operated full-time according to the agreement reached at a 
December 17 meeting of Afghan and Tajik officials (reftel).  Recent 
winter weather conditions have led to a decrease in commercial 
traffic and to the bridge's unexpected, but welcomed, use for 
passenger traffic.  The provincial National Directorate of Security 
director is satisfied with bridge security.  Afghan officials 
confirm that use of the bridge remains toll-free. 
 
Winter Weather: Decreased Traffic, Taxi Transfers 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶2. (U) The Afghan-Tajik bridge is open eight hours a day, six days a 
week (closed on Sundays).  This year's winter weather conditions, 
among the harshest in Afghanistan's recent history, have affected 
seasonal traffic across the bridge.  Commercial traffic has 
temporarily decreased to approximately 20-25 trucks and four-five 
cars per day.  Several days of heavy snowfall closed the Salang Pass 
connecting Northern Afghanistan to the rest of the country, 
noticeably affecting commercial traffic. 
 
¶3. (U) The extreme weather conditions also resulted in the temporary 
cessation of the passenger ferry between Afghanistan and Tajikistan 
due to below-freezing fuel temperatures.  While the Afghans and 
Tajiks have yet to agree to pedestrian traffic on the bridge (there 
is a sidewalk provided), they did agree to the emergency measure of 
taxis transporting passengers to the middle of the bridge for 
transfer and continuation of their journey. 
 
No Drug Trafficking Across Bridge? 
---------------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) The provincial NDS director told PRTOff that he was 
satisfied with bridge security and did not believe the bridge would 
be used for drug trafficking, noting that informal border-crossing 
points in neighboring districts were easier trafficking routes and 
less likely to be subject to interdiction.  He said that Tajikistan 
had recently decided to ban imports of right-hand drive vehicles, 
which had halted a profitable re-export opportunity for Afghan 
traders. 
 
Bridge Remains Toll-free 
------------------------ 
¶5. (U) Afghan provincial border and customs officials confirmed that 
use of the bridge remains toll-free.  Customs officials currently 
collect the duty according to a tariff schedule as well as a truck 
tax, ranging from USD 50-200 depending on the vehicle's size and 
number of axles.  The Ministry of Commerce collects USD 4 per 
vehicle and a tonnage charge for loading and unloading vehicles for 
security inspection. 
 
¶6. (U) Comment: While the extreme weather has had an impact on the 
number of commercial vehicles crossing the bridge, traffic continues 
to flow full-time.  The temporary use of the bridge for passenger 
traffic, a concession by Tajik officials, demonstrated its 
feasibility.  Afghan officials are pleased with the current bridge 
operations and continue to look for ways to increase its use and 
operational efficiency.
