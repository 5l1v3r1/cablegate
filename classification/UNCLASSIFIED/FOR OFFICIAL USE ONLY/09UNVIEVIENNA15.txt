REF: A. SECSTATE 3515, B. UNVIE 0007 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request.  See Para 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mission conveyed to the Permanent Mission of France, host 
of the January 22 meeting, Ref A instructions that the U.S. supports 
inviting Russia and Poland to the meeting, if the Afghan ambassador 
here concurs.  According to the French Mission, the Afghan 
ambassador has agreed to the proposal, and has also asked that China 
be invited to the meeting. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) China has generally kept a very low profile here on 
Afghanistan drug issues, although precursors from China to 
Afghanistan are a growing concern, according to the UNODC.  China 
did participate in one Paris Pact roundtable in Kabul in 2007.  One 
of the 2009 Pact roundtables will feature Central Asia and China. 
Mission believes the informal Friends group could be a good venue to 
encourage greater engagement by China. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action requested:  Mission requests Department guidance on 
Afghanistan's suggestion to invite China to the next Friends meeting 
in Vienna on January 22.  End Action Requested.
