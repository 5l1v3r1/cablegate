¶1.   (SBU) On October 20, the day of the UNESCO vote on the 
Cultural Diversity Convention, FCS Deputy Senior Commercial 
Officer spoke with the Brazilian Ministry of Trade's 
International Relations Director.  Our contact said that 
upon receiving Secretary Gutierrez's letter, Trade Minister 
Furlan had tasked four of his Secretariats (DAS equivalents) 
to study whether the UNESCO Convention would impede trade. 
Upon reporting back to the Minister, all agreed with the 
analysis contained in the various USG non-papers/notes. 
Minister Furlan then called the Minister of Culture, 
Gilberto Gil, who informed him that the GOB planned to vote 
in favor of the Convention at the scheduled vote. 
Nevertheless, Furlan stated to Gil that he would seek to 
raise this issue (belatedly) in the GOB's interagency trade 
meeting the week of October 24. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Finally, our contact thought that it would be 
helpful if the USG could provide specific statistics and/or 
a detailed study on how the Convention might impact various 
industries.
