SUBJECT: ITALY BRIEFED ON TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR UN SENIOR 
CIVILIAN FOR AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: STATE 1001 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Italian MFA 
Coordinator for Afghanistan Sergio Mercuri on January 7. 
Mercuri appreciated the opportunity to review the latest 
version of the terms of reference/job description and was 
pleased to find that the Senior Civilian Representative would 
have the explicit authority to engage, not just with major 
donors, but also with Afghanistan's neighbors in the region. 
He agreed that Lord Ashdown has the personal authority and 
energy needed to tackle the important task of donor 
coordination. 
 
¶2. (SBU) With regard to point 3 of the terms of reference 
(lead authority for the Afghanistan Compact/co-chair JCMB), 
Mercuri hoped that this function would allow donors and the 
Afghan government to conduct a review of the Compact which 
Italy believes is overdue.  He also reiterated the Italian 
position that the next donor conference on Afghanistan should 
include a review of the benchmarks and time frames of the 
Compact with a view toward focusing the energies of the donor 
community and the Afghan government.  Contrary to public 
intimations made by FM D'Alema in the past, Mercuri said that 
Italy is not interested in hosting such a conference, but 
would welcome the opportunity to collaborate on setting the 
conference agenda.
