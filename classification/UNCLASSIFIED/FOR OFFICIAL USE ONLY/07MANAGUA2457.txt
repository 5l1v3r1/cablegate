¶1. (SBU) On October 30, Econoff delivered Ref A demarche, on 
Brazilian efforts to weaken intellectual property protections 
for pharmaceuticals through World Health Organization fora, 
to Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Development (MIFIC) 
Director General for International Trade Sonia Somarriba. She 
was unable to provide a substantive response, but promised to 
study the issue.  She explained that the MIFIC official who 
covers World Trade Organization issues had recently left the 
ministry and that for intellectual property rights she has no 
permanent staff.  Somarriba reported that Nicaragua's mission 
in Geneva would represent Nicaragua in the upcoming 
Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation 
and Intellectual Property (IGWG). 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a follow-up conversation on November 6, Somarriba 
said the issue was still being studied.  In response to a 
related demarche delivered on September 6 (Ref C), MIFIC 
officials said that the best we could hope for is that 
Nicaragua would remain silent on this issue (Ref A). 
 
¶3. (SBU) As requested in Ref A, post has forwarded this 
information by email to Tanuja Garde at USTR.
