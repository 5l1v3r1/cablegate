¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, Embassy Buenos Aires will seek to place in 
local media an op-ed being drafted in the Department and will use 
its Strategic Distribution Initiative (SDI) to circulate background 
materials on Cuba to approximately 3,500 local contacts. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post contacted a local NGO, the Center for the Opening and 
Development of Latin America (CADAL), which has uniquely and 
persistently flagged concerns for freedom in Cuba.  CADAL said it 
was organizing some outreach to young Argentines to enlist their 
support for the plight of Cuba's prisoners of conscience, and post 
offered its assistance. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post is also seeking to contact Dr. Roberto Quinones, the 
son of Cuban neurosurgeon Hilda Molina who, since 1994, has been 
denied permission to leave Cuba to join her family.  If Quinones is 
available and agreeable to a meeting, post would use the meeting to 
draw attention to Dr. Molina's plight.
