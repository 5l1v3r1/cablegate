SUBJECT: ISTC Governing Board Meeting in Moscow 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: At the International Science and Technology Center 
(ISTC) Coordinating Committee (CC) and Governing Board (GB) meetings 
held December 3-5, the Russians lamented what, in their view, is a 
lack of genuine partnership at the ISTC and the neglect of Russia's 
rights and privileges under the agreement establishing ISTC.  The 
United States supported the need for the Russians to have full 
transparency into the workings of the ISTC, and joined the consensus 
that Russian privileges should be respected and these issues 
resolved.  The parties also approved the EU nominee to the Executive 
Director (ED) position, once Russia has concluded its internal 
approval by no later than January 1, 2008.  The United States 
informed other parties of our selection for Chief Financial Officer, 
but the Russians privately registered their opposition to the U.S. 
nominee.  The parties agreed to hold a U.S.-hosted working group in 
February to try to make progress on the issue of Russia's concerns 
that Georgia is unfairly benefiting from dual membership in both the 
ISTC and the Science Technology Center in Ukraine (STCU).  In a move 
forward in the ISTC's transformation, the parties agreed to launch a 
new pilot program to make science and technology institutes 
financially self-sustaining.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Executive Director Nomination: The Russian delegation 
expressed deep concern over the letter sent to the parties from the 
ISTC Governing Board Chairman, which had extended ED Norbert 
Jousten's term to December 31, 2007.  In Russia's view, the ED 
should not have been extended without Russia's explicit approval, 
whereas the Chairman had acted in the absence of a Russian 
objection.  The Russians indicated they are favorably disposed 
towards the EU's nomination of ED candidate Adriaan van der Meer and 
will send formal approval by January 1, 2008. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Georgia's Dual Membership:  The GB agreed to establish a 
small working group of the funding parties, Russia, and Georgia in 
February 2008 before the next Governing Board meeting to discuss 
further the issue of Russia's concerns with Georgia's membership in 
both the ISTC and the STCU. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Host Government Concurrence (HGC): The funding parties 
raised the issue of Russia not providing HGC on new project 
proposals since August 2007.  Russia said it would not be able to 
provide HGC until an ISTC interagency coordination council was 
created, which required a signed order from President Putin.  The 
Governing board agreed that host states needed to accelerate their 
process of concurring with projects. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Position:  Russia pushed back 
on the U.S. nomination for the CFO position.  The Russians expressed 
frustration at not having transparency into the finances at the ISTC 
and the repeated refusal of the incumbent to support Russian 
proposals for an audit of the ISTC by a Russian auditor.  The United 
States indicated its support for the Russians to regain full 
transparency into all the ISTC's finances in its role as the host 
state, as specified in the ISTC's founding documents.  The Russians 
asked that the United States consider its concerns as it filled this 
vacancy. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Sustainability Pilot Program: The GB approved a list of 
nine institutes for the first round of the ISTC's new effort to work 
with institutes in creating self-sustainability plans.  The parties 
also provided substantial new funding for this effort and agreed to 
hire staff, begin new accounting procedures, and eventually make 
organizational changes. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Institute Access: The ISTC held a useful Access Working 
Group meeting to address the concerns raised by several sensitive 
Russian institutes experiencing a large volume of visits from ISTC 
staff, funding parties and international collaborators.  The meeting 
fostered a productive discussion of how to provide access to these 
facilities consistent with Russian laws.  Russia said that until an 
order on the ISTC was signed by President Putin, it could not 
provide further information about the specific number of days of 
advance notice that would be required for site access requests to 
sensitive Russian institutes.  The United States expressed 
willingness to revisit the rules on site access requests in order to 
address Russian concerns. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Programmatic Approach: The GB approved five basic areas for 
scientific research projects, but agreed to change the process in 
the future from one driven by the ISTC's scientific advisors to one 
determined by the parties, taking special account of the science and 
technology needs of the host states. 
 
¶9. (SBU) International Audit Tender: After the EU and Russia 
expressed concerns over the criteria behind the choice for the 
ISTC's international auditor, the GB decided to re-tender the 
contract and add new selection criteria placing more weight on 
companies who do not currently hold the contract. 
 
¶10. (SBU) U.S. Budget Contributions: The U.S. Department of State 
committed over three million dollars for the ISTC Administrative 
Operative Budget ($400,000 of this amount was contributed by the 
Department of Energy) and $2,360,000 for the Supplemental Budget. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Project Funding: The U.S. Department of State committed 
$204,000 in regular project funding ($114,000 to Regular Project 
#3799 and $90,000 to Regular Project #3515). 
¶12. (SBU) Next GB Meeting:  The next GB meeting will be held in 
Dushanbe, Tajikistan on April 10, 2008.
