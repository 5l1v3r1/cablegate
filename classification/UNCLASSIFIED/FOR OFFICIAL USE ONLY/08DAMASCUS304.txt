Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  [SBU] Pink balloons, ribbons, and posters festooned a 
high-traffic area of Damascus on Saturday, April 12 for the 
first-ever "March for Survival."  The walk, organized by the Syrian 
Breast Cancer Society, inspired by the October 2007 International 
Visitor Program on "Breast Cancer Awareness."  Two members of the 
society participated in the IVP and took part in the Susan B. Komen 
Race for the Cure in San Diego.  One of the IVP alumni told CAO she 
wanted the Damascus walk "to be as close to the U.S. experience as 
possible."  The event drew 200-250 women and men, media attention, 
and private/public sector sponsorship.  The walk proved the 
existence of a small but significant space for civil society to 
operate in Syria.  End summary.

International Visitor Inspiration 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  [U] Participation in the October 2007 International Visitor 
Program on "Breast Cancer Awareness" inspired Lamya Hussari and Dr. 
May Mahayni, two members of the Syrian Breast Cancer Society, to 
duplicate the American model for successful awareness raising: a 
walk or march.  Using the example of the Susan B. Komen Race for the 
Cure, the Syrian Breast Cancer Society staged the first "March for 
Survival" on Saturday, April 12.  Between 200-250 people 
participated in this first of its kind event in Damascus. 
Participants included a large number of doctors and medical 
students, both men and women, as well as delegations from the Syrian 
Red Crescent Society and the UN High Commission for Refugees 
(UNHCR).  Local media were out in force covering the event. 
 
¶3.  [U] The walk received sponsorship from a number of local and 
international private and public sector institutions, including: 
Total E&P, MPI (pharmaceutical company), SyriaTel, Syrian Arab Red 
Crescent, Shami Hospital, Novartis Oncology, Bank Audi, Health World 
(magazine), Arabesque FM (106.9), Kodak, and Carestream Health. 
While donations were solicited at the walk, the main goal was 
awareness rather than fundraising.  The government also lent its 
support.  The Deputy Minister of Health, Dr. Mohammad Jamil 
Al-Owayed, spoke at the finish line about the importance of breast 
cancer awareness, early detection, and praised the Breast Cancer 
Society for its work.

Comment: Civil Society in Action 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  [SBU] Syrian civil society is constrained in its areas of 
operation and limits itself largely to government-sanctioned, 
apolitical spheres such as healthcare.  The Syrian Breast Cancer 
Society and other nascent non-governmental organizations, notably 
environmental associations, focus on awareness and 
consciousness-raising among Syria's youth. While small, the "March 
for Survival" was notable for the broad participation it attracted 
and for the organizers' ability to obtain all the necessary 
permissions as well as high-level government support.
