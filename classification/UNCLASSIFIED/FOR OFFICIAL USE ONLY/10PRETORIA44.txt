Report Speculates Zuma Likely To Pardon Apartheid Hit-Squad Chief 
 
 
¶2. (U)  The Sunday Independent on January 3 reported that President 
Jacob Zuma spent more than three hours in a meeting with convicted 
apartheid hit-squad commander Eugene de Kock during a secret visit 
to Pretoria Central Prison last year.  "It was two warriors from 
opposing sides talking about peace and reconciliation," according to 
sources close to De Kock who spoke to Independent Newspapers and who 
described the encounter as "cordial."  In return for a pardon, the 
man once dubbed "Prime Evil" has made it clear that he is prepared 
to cooperate in helping with any new investigations into 
apartheid-era atrocities, including the recovery of bodies of 
victims of the security forces.  De Kock was sentenced in 1996 to 
two life terms and 212 years on 89 criminal charges, including 
murder, conspiracy to murder, and fraud.  [Description of Source:

Service Delivery Protest in the Vaal 
 
¶3. (U)  Residents of Mamello informal settlement near the Vaal Dam 
in Johannesburg on January 3 took to the streets in demand of better 
services.  Community leader Jonas Matshaneng said he was tired of 
living in an area where there is no development.  He said they have 
been living in the area for more than 20 years and there were no 
changes.  He said protesters want housing, water, electricity, 
sanitation, a clinic, and schools.  Gauteng Department of Housing 
and Local Government spokesperson Fred Mokoko told reporters that 
they were prepared to build houses for the residents but will meet 
the Midvaal local municipality to discuss the issues first.

ANC to Focus on Job Creation 
 
¶4. (SBU)  African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede 
Mantashe told reporters on January 4 the country's economic climate 
will get worse before it gets better.  Mantashe says growing the 
economy will be the main focus this year.  The Secretary General 
warned that South Africans can only expect to see jobs being created 
towards the end of the year.  Last year, the ANC committed to 
creating more quality jobs and sustainable livelihoods but plans 
were disrupted by an economic recession leading to thousands of lost 
jobs.  The ANC government is working hard to refine and finalize its 
high impact industrial strategy which seeks to deepen South Africa's 
manufacturing base.  (SABCNEWS, January 5, 2010) 
 
"Hawks" to Investigate Leaked National Exams 
 
¶5. (SBU)  A case involving Mpumalanga giving exam answers out to 
students ahead of South Africa's national educational test has been 
handed over to the government's special investigating team known as 
the "Hawks."  Department of Education officials on January 5 told 
reporters the "Hawks" should take over the investigations because 
Qreporters the "Hawks" should take over the investigations because 
the unit is more advanced than the police.  Thirteen people, 
including an official from the Department of Education, were 
arrested in late 2009 for releasing test answers.  (Sowetan, January

South African Islamic Body Condemns Tough Security Measures for 
US-Bound Airline Travelers 
 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Cape Town Voice of the Cape Online reported on 06 January 
that the increased security measures being introduced in many 
countries after a failed attempt to bomb a US plane last month 
amounted to clear racial and religious profiling.  As such, it 
should be resisted more than accommodated, said Iqbal Jassat, 
chairperson of the Gauteng lobby group, the Media Review Network 
(MRN), on Tuesday evening while speaking on VOC's Late Night Live. 
The comment came after the US announced that it would toughen 
security measures for US-bound airline passengers from or via 14 
countries.  [Description of Source: Cape Town Voice of the Cape
