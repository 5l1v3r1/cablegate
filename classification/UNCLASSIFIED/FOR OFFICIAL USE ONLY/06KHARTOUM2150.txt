Health Worker Killed in Darfur 
The International Rescue Committee is saddened to report the death 
of an IRC nurse during fighting in Hashaba, North Darfur, on Friday, 
Sept. 1.  The victim, a 37-year-old Sudanese national, ran the IRC's 
health center in Hashaba, about 100 kilometers north of El Fasher. 
The health center, along with a pharmacy and guesthouse managed by 
the IRC, were also looted during the fighting there. 
With this tragic death, the toll of humanitarian workers killed in 
Darfur since May rises to 12, a sign of the deteriorating security 
situation in the region. 
The IRC, the sole health care provider in the Hashaba area, has not 
been able to access an estimated population of 85,000 for more than 
three months due to instability there.  As a result, people in this 
area have been denied access to the basics of human survival.  The 
IRC commends its Sudanese workers and volunteers, who have worked 
tirelessly to provide what services they can in these difficult 
circumstances. 
The IRC calls upon all parties to the conflict in Darfur to cease 
targeting civilians and humanitarian workers.  We hope to be able to 
access this area and resume providing humanitarian services as soon 
as possible. 
In Darfur, the International Rescue Committee is providing 
humanitarian services, including primary health care, water and 
environmental sanitation, to 740,000 people in need.  The IRC has 
been working in Sudan for 25 years and began operations in Darfur in 
2004 in response to the humanitarian crisis there.  Its Darfur work 
is supplemented by more than 1,100 "incentive workers," such as the 
victim in Friday's violence, who receive small stipends or other 
incentives for their efforts.  They play a vital role in assisting 
the IRC with the provision of humanitarian assistance. 
The International Rescue Committee extends its deepest sympathies to 
the family of the victim, a valued colleague and friend.  His death 
is a loss for IRC Sudan and for the organization.

United Nations Condemns Killing of Nurse in Darfur 
Khartoum, 5th September 
 
The United Nations strongly condemns the death of another 
humanitarian worker in the increasingly unstable region of Darfur in 
Sudan. 
 
The victim, a nurse, was working with the International Rescue 
Committee.  The health centre where the victim worked was also 
looted, along with a pharmacy and guesthouse also managed by IRC. 
 
"It saddens us greatly that yet another aid worker has been killed 
in Darfur," said Manuel da Silva, the UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator 
in Sudan.  "We are also alarmed that an attack on a clinic has 
occurred.  The targeting and looting of a humanitarian facility such 
as a medical centre is completely unacceptable.  The neutrality and 
essential services provided by such facilities must be recognized by 
all."
