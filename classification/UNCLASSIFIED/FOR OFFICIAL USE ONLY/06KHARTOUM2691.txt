¶2. (SBU) U/S Mutriff responded that UN country resolutions should be 
objective and not subject to retaliatory measures.  He stated that 
they should be debated openly and voted upon, with the UN's response 
to human rights issues "upgraded."  Mutriff also said that he would 
pass the demarche on to the Department for International 
Organizations for further review. 
 
¶3. (U) Post will follow-up with the MFA to determine if specific 
positions have developed on the individual country resolutions.
