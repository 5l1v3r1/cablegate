¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points to Ellen Goelz, desk 
officer for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation at the German 
MFA on June 30.  Goelz welcomed the talks and noted that 
Germany will continue to press China as necessary on space 
issues.  She also promised to share the information with 
relevant personnel within the MFA and other German ministries. 
 
¶2. (U) In addition, Goelz mentioned that, during a recent 
trip to Brussels, she discussed the idea with Deputy Director 
for Space Policy, Richard Buenneke, of holding joint MFA/MOD 
expert-level talks with U.S. counterparts in Berlin.  She 
renewed this offer and expressed a desire to host the talks 
at our convenience later this summer or in early autumn.
