SUBJECT: GERMANY H1N1 UPDATE: 2,455 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 884, B) Berlin 880 and previous. 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The net number of H1N1 infections in Germany 
rose by 637 cases to a total of 2,455 on July 23.  The 
majority of new infections occurred abroad, mainly during 
travel to 
Spain.  Experts expect more severe cases of the infection. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U)  At its July 23 press briefing, the National Reference 
Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
announced 638 new laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 and 
subtracted one previously confirmed case in Schleswig- 
Holstein.  This net increase of 637 cases brings the total to 
2,455.  New cases were distributed among fifteen federal 
states: Schleswig-Holstein (-1), North Rhine-Westphalia (340), 
Lower-Saxony (94), Baden-Wuerttemberg (29), Bavaria (83), 
Rhineland-Palatinate (15), Berlin (14), Saxony (13), Saxony- 
Anhalt (12), Hesse (11), Saarland (10), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern 
(9), Bremen (3), Thuringia (3), Hamburg (1), and Brandenburg 
(1). 
 
¶3. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the state with the 
highest number of virus cases among all German states with a 
total of 943 followed by Lower-Saxony (516) and Baden- 
Wuerttemberg (249 cases).  Less than 30 percent (618) of all 
confirmed infections in Germany have resulted from domestic 
transmission. 
 
 
Increase Mainly due to Holiday Returnees 
---------------------------------------- 
¶4. (U)  According to RKI, 528 of the 637 new cases were found 
in people returning from vacation, primarily from Spain. 
 
 
More Severe Cases of Infections Expected 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  RKI expects more severe cases of the new virus in 
Germany.  Vice-president Reinhard Burger told media that an 
increase in the number of cases in turn increases the 
likelihood of finding more severe cases, similar to what other 
countries have experienced.  He said that at this point in 
time, it is not clear why certain infections are mild and 
others are fatal.
