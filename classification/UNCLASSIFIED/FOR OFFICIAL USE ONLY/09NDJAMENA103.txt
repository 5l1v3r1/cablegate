------------------------- 
A TURKISH EMBASSY IN CHAD? 
-------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (U) Visiting Turkish AMB-Designate to Chad Omur Solendil 
told AMB March 24 that Turkey was planning to open an Embassy 
in Chad, perhaps before the end of this year. A political 
decision had been made in Ankara, Solendil said, but now the 
funding issue had to be worked out. 
 
-------------------------- 
INCREASED TURKISH PRESENCE 
IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Solendil said that the Chad Embassy was part of a 
broader effort to increase Ankara's diplomatic presence in 
Sub-Saharan Africa.  Solendil, who is resident in Tripoli and 
accredited there, said that the Chad Embassy was one of 12 
additional African posts that the Turks were planning to 
open.  Slated for establishment at about the same time as the 
embassy in Chad would be embassies in Mali, Tanzania, Ghana 
and Cameroon.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) A Turkish Embassy here would be useful if Ankara 
were to lend its weight to  encouraging reduction in 
Chad-Sudan tensions, a solution in Darfur, and continued 
Libyan engagement to those ends. 
 
¶4.  Tripoli minimize considered.
