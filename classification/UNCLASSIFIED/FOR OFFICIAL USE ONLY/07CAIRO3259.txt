1.(U) There have been a number of media reports that 
imprisoned Egyptian blogger Abdel Karim Nabil Soliman is 
being tortured in the Borg Al Arab prison in Alexandria, 
where he is serving a four-year sentence following his 
February 2007 conviction for "inciting hatred of Islam" and 
"defaming the President of the Republic." (reftels). 
 
¶2. (U) In a November 12 press release, the Arabic Network for 
Human Rights Information reported that it, together with the 
Hisham Mubarak Centre for Law, had sent a letter to the 
Prosecutor General (Egypt's Attorney General equivalent), 
alleging that Abdel Karim had been tortured "on the order and 
under the supervision of an officer in Borg Al Arab prison" 
and asking that the alleged torture be investigated. On 
November 13, the blog "Sand Monkey" reported that Abdel Karim 
had been beaten and threatened by other inmates, at the 
direction of prison officials. Sand Monkey also reported that 
Abdel Karim was placed in a disciplinary cell in shackles, 
despite injuries received in the alleged beatings. The Cairo 
newspaper "Nahdet Misr" also reported on some of the 
allegations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) After learning of the reports, we contacted Abdel 
Karim's lawyer. He said the allegations of torture were 
overstated. The lawyer reported, however, that Abdel Karim is 
being segregated from other prisoners, allegedly for his 
protection. The lawyer added that the segregation is 
unnecessary and a form of harassment.
