¶1. (SBU) Senator Russell Feingold called on Indonesian 
Attorney General Abdul Rachman Saleh on February 22.  The 
Senator opened with questions regarding the status of the 
Timika case and received assurance that the Attorney 
General's Office will follow the evidence and expects to 
convict those currently in police custody.  When asked about 
the Terrorism and Transnational Crime Taskforce, the AG said 
it should be operational in one month.  Saleh noted the GOI's 
successes in its anti-corruption efforts, and Senator 
Feingold ended the meeting by noting his personal interest in 
the success of the Truth and Friendship Commission on East 
Timor.  End Summary. 
 
Senator Feingold meets AG Saleh 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Senator Feingold called on Indonesian Attorney 
General Abdul Rachman Saleh on February 22.  The Senator was 
accompanied by Foreign Policy Adviser Grey Frandsen, Senate 
Intelligence Committee staff member Evan Gottesman, and the 
Ambassador.  Deputy Attorney General Basrief Arief, Special 
Assistant to the AG Muhammad Salim, Prosecutor Narendra 
Jatna, and Spokesperson Masyudi Ridwan accompanied AG Saleh. 
Senator Feingold said that as a longtime follower of 
Indonesia, he appreciates the importance of the 
U.S.-Indonesian bilateral relationship and believes the USG 
should emphasize it more in its foreign policy.  Saleh noted 
his upcoming trip to Washington and his hopes for a 
productive visit. 
 
Timika Investigation Proceeds 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Senator asked the AG about the status of 
Anthonious Wamang, who was indicted in the U.S. for the 2002 
ambush and killing of two U.S. citizens (ref B).  Saleh 
replied that the case dossier remains with the Indonesian 
National Police who continue to investigate and develop their 
evidence.  Once they have completed the dossier, the Attorney 
General's Office will review the evidence and prepare for 
trial, a process they expect will last for two months.  AG 
Saleh said the case seemed "not too complicated" to prosecute 
but acknowledged that he has not seen the evidence.  When 
asked about the role of the FBI in the investigation, Saleh 
responded that he believes it is useful, but ultimately the 
judges presiding over the case will rule on its usefulness. 
Senator Feingold asked that the AG seriously consider the 
FBI's continued involvement and stressed the need for 
accountability in this case even if the evidence points to 
GOI civilian or military involvement in the incident.  AG 
Saleh said the GOI will follow the trail of evidence wherever 
it may lead but noted that military courts have jurisdiction 
over cases involving military actions and officers. 
 
Status of Terrorism and Transnational Crime Taskforce 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Senator Feingold asked about the status of the 
Terrorism and Transnational Crime Taskforce which Saleh 
officially created in September 2005 (ref D).  Saleh and his 
staff members stated that they continue to select personnel 
to staff the new unit but have identified and nearly 
completed preparing a space in which the Taskforce will work. 
 They hope it will be operational in one month.  Saleh said 
the GOI continues its fight against terrorism; the Yudhoyono 
Administration takes the issue seriously, having recently 
expanded the scope of its CT efforts to include religious 
leaders and political parties rather than only GOI law 
enforcement officials (ref C).  Senator Feingold asked about 
the relative strength of the terrorist organization Jemaah 
Islamiyah (JI), and Saleh responded that it remains a small 
 
JAKARTA 00002530  002 OF 002 
 
 
extremist faction.  Saleh and his staff noted that Indonesian 
courts have stated in their decisions that JI does exist and 
Abu Bakar Ba'asyir led the terrorists before his 
incarceration (ref E). 
 
Anti-Corruption Efforts 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) Senator Feingold expressed the need to combat 
corruption and to prevent it from spawning other societal 
ills. Saleh proudly responded that the AGO nationwide has 
taken on nearly 500 corruption cases over the past year. 
Saleh said the current Cabinet represents the GOI's most 
serious effort in history to combat corruption, collusion, 
and nepotism and that his office has not shied away from 
prosecuting high-profile cases.  Saleh pointed to the 
reorganization of the district and appeals courts to fall 
under the supervision of the Supreme Court as the most 
important aspect of judicial reform in recent years.  Saleh 
also said that the Judicial Commission does not understand 
its mandate and continues to overreach.  Saleh believes the 
Judicial Commission should not be allowed to review the 
performance of Supreme Court Justices nor to review decision 
made by judges (unless evidence of corruption exists) as such 
actions would lead to a politicized Court.  Saleh stated that 
strong AGO efforts to prosecute corrupt judges would most 
effectively clean up the institution. 
 
Truth and Friendship Commission 
-------------------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) Senator Feingold concluded the meeting with 
questions on East Timor and again stressed the need for 
accountability and justice.  Saleh said that he could not yet 
evaluate the performance of the Truth and Friendship 
Commission as it has not yet had enough time to produce 
results.  He and Senator Feingold noted the seemingly good 
relationship between the Indonesian and Timorese presidents, 
and Senator Feingold noted the USG's and his personal 
interest in the future work of the Commission. 
 
¶7. Codel Feingold has cleared this message.
