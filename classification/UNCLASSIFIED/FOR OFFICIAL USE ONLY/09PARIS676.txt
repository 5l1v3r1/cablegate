SUBJECT: French SPOT-4 Satellite's Near Miss of orbiting space 
debris 
 
¶1. (U) On Tuesday, May 12, Embassy Paris was involved in 
establishing a link between the French National Center for Space 
Research ("CNES") Orbit determination Operational Centre  (COO) and 
the U.S. Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) at Vandenberg Air 
Base concerning the possible collision of the French SPOT-4 earth 
imaging satellite and space debris.  At 10 a.m. Paris time, the 
Environment, Science, Technology and Health (ESTH) Counselor was 
telephoned by the State Department Operations Center and informed of 
the possible collision.  Working in concert with the NASA European 
Representative, and also the DOD European Space Liaison Officer, 
Richard McKinney ESTH Counselor contacted the appropriate official 
in CNES, who promptly asked for detailed information from JSpOC. 
 
¶2.  (U) Meanwhile, ESTH Counselor was also working with the State 
Department Bureau of International Security and Non-Proliferation 
(ISN) to grant "DIRLAUTH" (direct liaison authorization) between 
JSpOC and CNES so CNES could obtain the details it needed. 
Eventually, DIRLAUTH was granted, and JSpOC talked directly to CNES. 
 The good news is that the collision did not take place, and SPOT-4 
is still imaging earth. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Embassy was pleased to be able to assist in 
facilitating communication between CNES and JSpOC  Given the extent 
of French space activity, and the inevitable time delays in 
diplomatic communication channels, we recommend that JSpOC  should 
have an ongoing channel for direct communication with CNES.  JPsPOC 
might also consider similar channels of communication for Germany 
and Italy.
