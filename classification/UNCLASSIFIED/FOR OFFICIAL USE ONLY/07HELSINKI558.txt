REF: SECSTATE 94985 
 
(SBU) In response to reftel demarche, the Finnish MFA 
informed PolChief July 20 that it had forwarded to the 
Ministry of Defense our request for assistance to help fund 
the purchase of fully armored vehicles (FAVs) for the MFO. 
MFA officials did not expect a response before mid- or 
late-August, but indicated that the GOF was receptive to our 
request and would see what it could do.  We welcomed the fact 
that Finland is considering support for this request, and 
will follow up in early August.
