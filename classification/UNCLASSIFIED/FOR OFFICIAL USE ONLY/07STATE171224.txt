¶1.  Please deliver the following message from Assistant 
Secretary Fried to the Foreign Minister of Spain, 
 
SIPDIS 
Miguel Moratinos, at the earliest opportunity.  The 
Department does not intend to release 
this letter but has no objections if the Government of Spain

¶2.  Begin text: 
 
Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
I am replying on behalf of Secretary Rice to thank you for 
your invitation to the first Alliance of Civilizations Forum 
to be held in Madrid, January 15-16, 2008.  I regret that 
Secretary Rice has other commitments that prevent her from 
 
SIPDIS 
attending the Forum, but the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, 
Eduardo Aguirre, will be pleased to represent the United 
States. 
 
The United States applauds your efforts to build bridges 
between cultures and nations and your commitment to the 
Alliance of Civilizations initiative.  We look forward to 
continued close cooperation with you as we address the many 
challenges facing us. 
 
I extend my best wishes for a successful meeting and look 
forward to hearing about the results. 
 
Sincerely, 
Daniel Fried 
RICE
