¶1. (SBU) August 9 Poloff delivered reftel points to MFA 
Acting Office Director for Human Rights Francesco De Stefani, 
stressing that a UN Human Rights Council (HRC) Special 
Session on Lebanon would be a distraction that could 
undermine UN Security Council (UNSC) efforts to bring about a 
cessation of hostilities.  Poloff urged the GOI to oppose the 
Special Session.  De Stefani responded August 10, noting the 
GOI shared U.S. concerns and viewed a UN HRC session on 
Lebanon as unhelpful.  Pointing out that Italy was not 
currently a member of the HRC, De Stefani said the GOI would 
nevertheless work with its EU partners to register European 
concerns with the Special Session. 
 
¶2. (SBU) August 10 Sebastiano Cardi, MFA Directorate General 
for Political Multilateral Affairs, told A/Pol MC that Italy 
agreed the UN HRC Special Session was not helpful, but that 
the GOI believed it would be difficult to stop it without a 
breakthrough at the UNSC.  According to Cardi, the draft HRC 
resolution was "bad" and he hoped the EU countries on the 
council would vote against it, as they had on the last draft 
resolution on the Palestinian situation.  He noted that the 
GOI was actively engaging on the issue within the EU.
