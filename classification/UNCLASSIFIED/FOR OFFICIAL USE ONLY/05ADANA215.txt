1.(SBU)  Southeast Turkey's cities and small townships have been 
experiencing considerable civil unrest and protesting since the 
11/9 Semdinli incident in which the Jandarma Intelligence 
Service is alleged to have bombed a local mayor's public event. 
Protesters calling for an investigation of the Jandarma 
Intelligence Service's activities in Hakkari, as well as often 
espousing support for pro-PKK issues, have clashed with police 
on an almost nightly basis in Hakkari's cities of Hakkari, 
Semdinli and Yuksekova, as well as in Van, Sanliurfa, 
Diyarbakir, Mersin, Mardin and Adana provinces.  Press reports 
indicate approximately a half dozen deaths and several dozen 
seriously wounded protestors and police in the clashes. 
 
2.(SBU)  In Adana, there have been 50-60 strong civilian clashes 
with the police in neighborhoods 3-4 kilometers from the 
consulate and 8-10 kilometers from the residences approximately 
seven evenings since Nov. 13.  These clashes frequently have 
featured Turkish National Police (TNP) deployment of several 
riot control units and seen rock throwing and Molotov cocktail 
launching by protestors answered by TNP deployment of water 
cannons and tear gas accompanied by baton use.  Additionally, 
the TNP told the press that they arrested four ESP (small 
Socialist leftist group) members on Nov.20 for protesting the 
Semdinli incident. 
 
3.(SBU)  Meanwhile, there are credible press reports of probable 
PKK terror attacks on GoT security forces in Van, Sirnak and 
Mardin in the last week, resulting in approximately 8 killed and 
a dozen wounded.  On 11/17, a probable PKK terror attack 
derailed railroad cars on a train in Van province.  GoT forces 
also reportedly are engaging in counter-terrorist sweep 
operations in Tunceli, Mardin, Sirnak (near Silopi) and Hakkari 
provinces. 
 
4.(U) Baghdad minimize considered.
