¶1. (SBU)  The January 11 Policy Action Group (PAG) approved 
two Afghan National Auxiliary Police (ANAP) proposals.  The 
first will expand the authorization of ANAP for Kandahar from 
1300 to 2000.  The additional 700 police will be recruited 
from and deployed to Panjwayi and Zharey districts to 
backfill the ISAF-led military operation Baaz Tsuka with 
permanent police presence.  While the PAG did not discuss the 
proposal in detail, ISAF briefed the Senior SOG on January 6 
that elders from Panjwayi and Zharey fully supported the 
expansion plan and that it was critical to maintaining 
control of this key area.  CSTC-A confirmed that there is 
enough training capacity, including mentor support, at the 
Kandahar Regional Training Center to implement the plan.  All 
involved understand the need to thoroughly vet the recruits; 
an MOI vetting inspection team is traveling to Kandahar soon 
to review quality control. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The second proposal approved by the PAG was to 
expand the ANAP program to the eight eastern provinces of 
Paktia, Paktika, Khost, Kunar, Laghman, Logar, Nangahar, and 
Nuristan.  This plan was  developed by CJTF-76 Task Force 
Spartan and provides for limited training using existing 
assets - no trainers will be drawn away from the south to 
support the expansion.  Most of the training will occur in 
relatively small numbers at the PRTs, although some training 
may take place at the RTCs at Gardez and Jalalabad.   This 
proposal has been fully coordinated with the MOI and ISAF and 
it has been assessed that sufficient resources are in place 
to move ahead. 
 
¶3. (SBU) CSTC-A Commanding General Durbin, who briefed the 
plan, emphasized that vetting and command/control issues 
remain a concern.  While the close involvement of TF Spartan 
makes those issues more manageable in the East, the planners 
welcome spot checks and inspection teams from the 
international community, including U.S. Embassy, to confirm 
that ethnic balance and other vetting concerns have been 
fully addressed.  The only other province for which there is 
sufficient accountability at this time is Herat, where one 
class of ANAP may be trained at the RTC so long as it does 
not conflict with upcoming Civil Order Police training 
(scheduled to begin January 27).  (Note: ANAP deployment in 
Herat province would be focused on the troubled district of 
Shindand as well as supporting regular police in Herat city. 
End note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) There are an additional seven provinces where MOI 
has recruited and vetted ANAP patrolmen (ahead of agreement 
from donors to pay for them):  Kapisa, Wardak, Parwan, Ghor, 
Faryab, Nimroz, and Daikundi.  These provinces will be 
considered on a case-by-case basis after the priority 
provinces in the south and east are staffed; training will 
only be requested once it has been assured that all recruits 
have been properly vetted with international community 
oversight and there is a viable Afghan National Police chain 
of command in place.  (Note:  Ghor Province PRToff reported 
on January 12 that conditions may be close to ready there. 
Lithuanian PRT and INL police mentors in Chagcharan are 
cooperating closely with the provincial leadership to ensure 
the quality of ANAP recruits.  There is an insurgent presence 
in areas of southern Ghor that needs to be countered by 
additional police presence there.  End note.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The request to expand ANAP in Kandahar, which was 
strongly advocated by international police trainers at the 
Kandahar PRT and RTC as well as ISAF operational commanders, 
shows that the ANAP has begun to play a positive role in 
local security in some areas.  UNAMA Deputy Senior 
Representative Chris Alexander, who had been very skeptical

of the ANAP, made the same point in a January 15 security 
meeting.  We agree that it is time to begin a measured 
expansion into other areas, particularly in support of 
GOA/ISAF counterinsurgency efforts.  The TF Spartan plan 
makes full use of the PRTs and international mentor support 
to maintain quality control and independently check MOI-led 
recruiting and vetting.  All elements involved in program 
implementation understand the need for quality 
control/quality assurance as the ANAP gradually expands.  PRT 
officers in the eight eastern provinces report that the 
Afghan leadership and international security forces in those 
provinces are eager to use ANAP to extend the reach of the 
central and provincial government into remote areas.  With 
international participation at all stages of implementation, 
we believe expanding the ANAP program to the east, and 
reinforcing it in the south contributes to the war effort.
