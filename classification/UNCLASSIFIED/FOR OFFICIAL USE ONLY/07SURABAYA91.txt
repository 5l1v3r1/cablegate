¶1. (U) On December 19, the Supreme Court accepted defeated 
incumbent Amin Syam's challenge to the November gubernatorial 
election results and asked the South Sulawesi Election 
Commission (KPUD) to hold re-elections in four regencies (Bone, 
Bantaeng, Gowa, and Tan Toraja).  The Supreme Courts decision 
annulled the KPUD's decision declaring challenger Syahrul Yasin 
Limpo the Governor of South Sulawesi (reftel).  According to 
press reports, Vice President and South Sulawesi native Jusuf 
Kalla asked Syahrul's supporters to accept the Supreme Court's 
decision. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On December 21, Andi Mappinawang, the Chairman of KPUD, 
told Consulate Surabaya that the South Sulawesi KPUD will 
challenge the decision and submit a request for judicial review 
on the grounds that the Supreme Court has no legal authority to 
order re-elections in four regencies.  He said that re-elections 
should only be conducted in polling stations where there is 
substantial evidence of manipulation or violations of election 
rules.  Mappinawang added that the funding for any re-elections 
had yet to be determined and the members of the KPUD would soon 
end their terms, further complicating the issue. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Sukriansyah, the Chief Editor of the local 
newspaper Fajar Daily, supporters of Amin Syam were holding a 
demonstration December 21 demanding the KPUD investigate and 
resolve questions of vote manipulation.  They argue that four 
days before the KPUD announced Syahrul as the victor, the KPUD 
had signaled that Amin Syam had received the majority of votes. 
Sukriansyah noted that with a margin of victory of just 25,000, 
regardless of previous election fraud or manipulation, any 
re-election could change the election results because voters 
might change their votes or decide not to vote at all.  He added 
that three of the four regencies in question are considered 
natural bases for Syahrul and his running mate Agus Nu'mang.
