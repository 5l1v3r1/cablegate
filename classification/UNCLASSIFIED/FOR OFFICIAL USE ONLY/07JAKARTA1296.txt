REF: STATE 56424 
 
¶1. (SBU) We met with Ms. Trini Gunarti, Deputy Director of 
the Department of Foreign Affairs Office of North and Central 
American Affairs, to outline our ideas for creation of an 
Asia Democracy Partnership (reftel).  We pointed out that 
Indonesia's experience in transitioning to democracy meant 
that it had much to offer others in the region. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ms. Gunarti responded that Partnership would be of 
interest of Foreign Minister Wirajuda, and asked whether the 
United States was proposing to fund it.  She also expressed 
some concern as to whether participation in the partnership 
was compatible with Indonesia's strong commitment to ASEAN. 
We responded that at this point, we were proposing more 
intensive consultations and soliciting input from prospective 
partners.  Ms. Gunarti undertook to share the proposal with 
Minister Wirajuda's staff as well as the Department's Human 
Rights and Inter-Regional Partnerships Directorate.
