¶1.  (SBU) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- 
Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Mission has received a diplomatic note 
from the GOI containing Indonesia's latest response to the 
U.S. proposal to create an Inter-sessional Meeting (ISM) on 
Nonproliferation and Disarmament.  The GOI proposes adding a 
reference to the Southeast Asia Treaty Nuclear Weapons-Free 
Zone (SEANWFZ) to the text of the proposal.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Indonesia continues to respond critically to the 
U.S. proposal to create an ISM on Nonproliferation (an ISM 
that, as a result of strenuous Indonesian insistence, is now 
titled ISM on "Nonproliferation and Disarmament").  Reftel 
provided an initial Indonesian response to the U.S. proposal; 
subsequent iterations have been handled in direct discussion 
by EAP/RSP representatives with GOI representatives at ARF 
meetings.  The latest response, without rejecting the 
proposal, urges the addition of a reference to the SEANFWFZ. 
 
¶4.  (U) Mission received a facsimile of the note on July 14. 
The original has not yet been received.  The text of the note

Re. ARF Inter-Sessional Meeting on Non-Proliferation and 
Disarmament 
 
Colleague, 
 
     Thank you for the latest draft of ARF Inter-Sessional 
Meeting on non-proliferation and Disarmament proposed by the 
United States of America that has been circulated in the ARF 
Senior Officials' Meeting.  In general, we could accept the 
concept paper, however, additional input is needed concerning 
the implementation of the South-East Asia Treaty Nuclear 
Weapon-Free-Zone. 
 
     We would like to propose additional element in the 
specific and concrete ways and means towards the future 
meetings of ISM namely as follows:  "Promoting the full 
implementation of the South-East Asia Treaty Nuclear 
Weapon-Free-Zone (Bangkok Treaty) and ensuring the early 
accession of the protocol to the Treaty by the Nuclear Weapon 
States." 
 
     It would be greatly appreciated if you could accommodate 
the input from Indonesia to the proposed paper of ISM. 
 
Yours Truly, 
//s//

Director General for Asia-Pacific and Africa
