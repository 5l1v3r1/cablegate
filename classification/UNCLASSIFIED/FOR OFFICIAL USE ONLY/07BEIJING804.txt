SUBJECT: COMMUNIST PARTY SCHOOL PROFESSOR SAYS IVP CHANGED HIS 
TEACHING ON ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ISSUES 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Niu Xianfeng, an Associate Professor at China's Central 
Communist Party School, said that participation in an International 
Visitor's Program (IVP) in the United States in September 2006 
changed the way he teaches his students, many of whom are high-level 
Communist Party officials from provinces throughout the country. 
Niu said that on his first trip to the United States, with stops in 
Washington, D.C., New York, Alabama, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and 
California, he was impressed by both the strength of the economy and 
the freedom of citizens to express their views.  Most importantly, 
Niu said he now believes democracy is the best political system and 
the sooner China becomes democratic, the better.  End Summary. 
 
WHAT A LONG, STRANGE TOUR:  A COMMUNIST IN ALABAMA 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Niu Xianfeng, Associate Professor in the Social Development 
Institute at China's Central Communist Party School, traveled to the 
United States September 9-30, 2006 on an International Visitors 
Grant.  Niu first was nominated by the Embassy's Economic Section in 
¶2005.  Niu's research and teaching focuses on rural development, 
public policy, and local governance, and he previously served as 
Vice Governor of Qijiang County in Chongqing Municipality.  Niu's 
visit to the United States included stops in Washington, D.C. 
(American politics, NGO management, United States-China relations, 
agricultural policy), Philadelphia (American politics and history), 
New York City (public administration and finance, role of religion 
in American life), Huntsville and Birmingham (economic development, 
local governance, civil rights), Lincoln (local governance, 
elections, rural development), and San Francisco (corporate 
responsibility, agricultural policy, economic development). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Niu said from a personal standpoint, Alabama was the most 
interesting stop.  He said the Civil Rights Museum in Birmingham was 
especially enlightening with regard to equality in the United 
States.  Niu added that seeing economic development from the 
perspective of the Southern United States was particularly useful, 
as he was able to observe differences in industrial structure 
between the South and the North and what he described as the slower 
pace of economic development in the South.  Most impressive to Niu, 
however, was that despite Alabama's historic social and economic 
struggles, the state continues to strongly support American 
democratic principles. 
 
SHOW ME THE MONEY:  VIEWS ON THE ECONOMY 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Niu said that after visiting all of the cities and 
interacting with government organizations at various levels, NGOs, 
and universities, he was impressed by the strength of the United 
States' economy.  Niu said there is no comparison between the 
economies of the United States in China, and he noted China's 
shortage of resources and comparatively low rate of consumption when 
compared to the United States.  Niu said he was especially impressed 
by San Jose's knowledge economy and the financial markets in New 
York.  He also said that China's economic policymakers and 
businessmen focus exclusively on profits, while American companies 
also include a social responsibility component in their operations. 
 
 
FREE AT LAST?  CHINA'S ROAD TO DEMOCRACY 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Niu said that he previously thought democracy was one of 
many good political systems and that democracy required a strong 
economy to be successful, but he stated that the IVP's most profound 
impact was changing this view.  Niu said that after seeing poor 
regions in the United States and talking to a number of people about 
the importance of elections, he realized that economic development 
is not a prerequisite for democracy.  Niu said China needs more 
elections.  The sooner China becomes democratic the better, Niu 
added. 
 
THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT:  REACHING OUT TO CADRES 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. (SBU) Niu said that he already has incorporated his newly 
acquired thoughts on economic and political reform into his 
classroom teaching at China's Central Communist Party School.  In 
classes that include high-level provincial government officials 
(such as Deputy Governors) and other Beijing-based Party cadres, Niu 
said that he has freely shared his views, including his support for 
China becoming more democratic, with his students.
