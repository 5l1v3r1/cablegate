REF: STATE 11499 
 
(SBU) Poloff delivered the reftel message on February 14 to 
Andreas Friedrich, Head of the MFA Arms Control and 
Disarmament Section.  Friedrich noted that there was no 
general agreement in that Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to 
provide such information, and that the states that had 
provided information previously had done so individually, in 
their national capacities. However, he said he would review 
the renewed request with other relevant Swiss government 
officials.
