Â¶1. (SBU) Anti-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden are "high on 
the agenda" of the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT), according to DFAIT 
counterterrorism senior policy advisor Neil Brennan.  Brennan 
added that DFAIT has been engaged in extensive internal 
consultations within the Canadian government on how to best 
contribute to international efforts to stamp out the 
"scourge" of piracy in this part of the world.  DFAIT Defense 
and Security Relations Division senior policy advisor Sarah 
Robertson is leading Canada's policy response on piracy, but 
she is on official travel until December 9, according to 
Defense and Security Relations Division contacts, who 
promised she will respond to reftel demarche request soon
