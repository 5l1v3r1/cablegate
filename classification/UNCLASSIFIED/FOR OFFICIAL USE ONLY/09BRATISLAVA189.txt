REF: J.GIAQUE 4/20 E-MAIL 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. Poloff discussed ref points on the April 
27-28 GAERC meeting with European Correspondent Albin Otruba 
on April 23. The discussion of Ukraine and Moldova, which 
will be held in the context of the Eastern Partnership, is 
the most interesting for Slovakia. Slovakia supports 
continuous dialogue with all of its eastern neighbors, 
including Belarus. Otruba said Iran will not be the subject 
of discussions, but will be mentioned in the conclusions. FM 
Lajcak plans to consult with his EU colleagues on the April 
29-30 visit to Slovkia of Syrian President Asad. End summary. 
 
EASTERN PARTNERSHIP 
------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Slovakia will support EU financial assistance to 
Ukraine, albeit with concrete conditions to ensure the money 
goes where it is needed. Otruba said it is in Slovakia's 
interest and the EU's that Ukraine be stabilized - 
financially, politically and in terms of security. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On Moldova, Otruba said no one can be happy with the 
results of recent elections, but dialogue must continue 
nonetheless. The EU needs to be actively engaged with both 
the government and the opposition in Moldova, and must strive 
to be trusted by both sides. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Otruba regretted that it is necessary to invite 
Lukashenka to the Prague summit, but - as with Moldova - it 
is more important to keep the country involved than to punish 
individual bad guys. "The EU must be present and influential 
with all of our eastern neighbors," said Otruba. 
 
CROATIA 
------- 
¶5. (SBU) Slovakia is "very unhappy" that Slovenia has brought 
a bilateral dispute with Croatia into the accession 
discussion so late in the game. Otruba described the 
situation as "unpleasant," and said it is particularly 
difficult for Slovakia since they are accustomed to excellent 
relations with both countries. Otruba said Slovakia would try 
to remain neutral in this GAERC meeting since he believes 
other, more influential countries, are prepared to take the 
lead in pressuring Slovenia to separate its bilateral dispute 
from the accession process. 
 
MIDDLE EAST 
----------- 
¶6. (SBU) Otruba said the Middle East will be discussed, and 
Slovak Foreign Minister Lajcak plans to speak about the April 
29-30 visit of Syrian President Asad to Slovakia with his 
European colleagues. Otruba believes Slovakia can be a 
trusted intermediary between Syria and "the big western 
states." Otruba said that Slovakia will encourage Syria to 
endorse the Arab Peace Process and normalize its relations 
with Lebanon. (Comment: It wasn't clear if the discussion on 
the Middle East would be formal or on the margins. End 
comment.)
