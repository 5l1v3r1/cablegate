SUBJECT: International Donor's Conference for the Habre trial 
 
REF: A) State 134183 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) The Government of Senegal had initially planned to hold a 
donor's conference for a future trial of former Chadian dictator 
Hissene Habre on September 17 with Minister of Foreign Affairs Gadio 
and Minister of Justice Sy chairing it.  That plan was abandoned and 
no new dates have been determined.  Post has been told by contacts 
at the Presidency that the conference might be held after the end of 
Ramadan.  With both President Wade and Foreign Minister Gadio 
attending the United Nations General Assembly, nobody in the 
Senegalese government will commit to a date or even confirm if the 
conference will be held.
