¶1.  (U) Ambassador delivered talking points on the upcoming 
IAEA Board of Governors meeting and Argentina's arrears to 
the IAEA to Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana on 
January 24.  As in previous discussions with Taiana on the 
Iranian nuclear program (reftels b and c), the Ambassador 
underscored the threat posed to international peace and 
security by Iran's defiance of the IAEA.  Noting Argentina's 
vote in the BOG could be critical, he urged the GoA to 
quickly resolve its assessment arrears with the IAEA in order 
to regain voting privileges. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Taiana confirmed that the Foreign Ministry had 
requested that the Economy Ministry make the payment of the 
arrears.  Taiana noted that Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez 
had yet to authorize the appropriate budget disbursements to 
meet obligations, not only to the IAEA, but also for internal 
Ministry functions, e.g. salaries.  The Ambassador asked 
Taiana if he thought it would be helpful if he (the 
Ambassador) phoned Fernandez to stress the importance of 
paying the arrears.  After some thought, Taiana replied that 
it would be helpful. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Subsequently, during the afternoon of January 24, 
the Ambassador spoke with Cabinet Chief Fernandez.  The 
Ambassador reminded Fernandez of the GoA's previous support 
of the EU-3 position in the IAEA and the importance of 
Argentina's participation in the upcoming BOG meeting. 
Fernandez said he understood the magnitude of the problem and 
that he would try to help. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On January 24, the Ambassador also spoke with 
Economy Minister Felisa Miceli as requested in reftel a. 
Miceli acknowledged that the GoA was in arrears to a large 
number of international organizations.  She said she 
understood the particular importance of the IAEA issue and 
was going to try to resolve the IAEA issue "in time," i.e. 
before the February 2 meeting. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) We will follow up with GoA interlocutors on a daily 
basis and inform the Department on the status of the GoA 
payment.
