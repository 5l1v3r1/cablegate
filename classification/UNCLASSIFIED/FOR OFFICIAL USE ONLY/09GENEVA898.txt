1.(SBU) The Israeli's local Trade Ministry rep approached the Charge 
today to ask our understanding of what the trade off might be 
between granting the PA observer status at the WTO Ministerial and 
the PA not pressing on GC observer status.  In particular, he wanted 
to know whether we thought this could be used to make the issue go 
away for an extended time or whether we were thinking the best we 
could do would be to make it go away for the November 17 General 
Council meeting.  He said that the issue has risen to the cabinet 
level and that some felt that buying peace for the November meeting 
was not enough.  Charge promised to check with Washington on what 
they thought was possible. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We only have a short time to bring this issue to closure. 
The agenda for the November General Council closes COB November 5 so 
by that time a decision will have to be taken on whether to place 
General Council Observer status, Ministerial Conference Observer 
status or neither on the agenda.  According to our Israeli 
colleague, GC Chair Matus plans to call a meeting on Friday to kick 
off consultations, though we have not heard from Matus yet. Things 
could get heated quickly. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Please advise what we can tell the Israelis here as to our 
expectations.
