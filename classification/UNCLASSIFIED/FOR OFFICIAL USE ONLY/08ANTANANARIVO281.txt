SBU) Per reftel, the Ambassador spoke with Madagascar's Foreign 
Minister Marcel Ranjeva again on April 10, following several recent 
conversations expre4ssing U.S. concerns about ZImbabwe.  FM Ranjeva 
said that while Madagascar is sympathetic to the USG's views on 
Zimbabwe, as the last member to join SADC Madagascar is at pains not 
to get out of step with SADC or the African Union by getting out in 
front of either on this "delicate" subject.  Ranjeva pointed to the 
upcoming April 18 SADC meeting in Mauritius, which he is slated to 
attend alongside President Ravalomanana, as the focal point for SADC 
discussions.  (He made no mention of an earlier SADC Summit to take 
place this weekend in Lusaka, which the April 10 Malagasy press is 
reporting.)
