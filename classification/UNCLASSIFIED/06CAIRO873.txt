DETENTION 
 
REF: CAIRO 783 AND PREVIOUS 
 
On February 12, Egypt released from detention the remaining 
156 Sudanese asylum-seekers who had been held since a 
December 30 confrontation with Egyptian police over refugee 
resettlement policies.  Egyptian state media first reported 
the release and stated that the detainees would not be 
deported.  MFA contacts confirmed the press report February 
13, and said the Sudanese were "staying with relatives and 
other Sudanese."  MFA Director of the Office of Refugee 
Affairs, Nasser Hamzawy, told poloff that the Sudanese had 
been provided with travel documents that would allow them to 
remain in Egypt legally for "two or three months."  Hamzawy 
noted that Egypt, despite its legal right to expel the 
detained Sudanese, had chosen not to deport the group to 
Sudan.
