     ¶B. IIR 6 807 0122 09 
 
¶1.  At its first cabinet meeting on December 30, the 
government of new Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy gave final 
approval for the sending of Belgian troops to Afghanistan as 
an Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT), charged 
with training soldiers of the Afghan National Army.  The 
first group of 16 soldiers left Belgium on January 5, headed 
for Kabul, where the Belgian OMLT is to take charge of a 
battalion of Afghan troops.  Fifty-three more soldiers will 
be sent to Afghanistan in March and the OMLT will transfer to 
the Northern Afghan town of Kunduz to continue training 
operations.  The OMLT will teach tactics and procedures to 
the Afghans.  It is taking with it eleven Iveco jeeps and 
seven Dingo II Multi-purpose Protected Vehicles equipped with 
defenses against improvised explosive devices (IED's). 
¶2.  The 16 Belgian trainers were accompanied by about thirty 
other troops from the Belgian Air Component who were sent to 
relieve members of the detachment operating the four F-16's 
Belgium is maintaining in Kandahar. 
 
¶3.  Each new deployment of Belgian troops abroad continues to 
be controversial to some degree. Defense Minister Pieter De 
Crem, who is a strong supporter of a more robust role for 
Belgium in operations such as ISAF, was obliged to state once 
again that "we have no intention of sending troops to the 
south of Afghanistan", which is considered to be more 
dangerous than the north.  He also told the press that the 
Belgians have received no demand for additional troops from 
NATO or the United States, despite the announced intention of 
the Obama administration to increase the number of troops 
committed to Afghanistan.  In December, just before the 
cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht hastened to 
deny a press report that he was opposed to the deployment. 
However, he said he had demanded and received a promise that 
the Belgians' role will be limited to training and not active 
operations. 
 
¶4.  The arrival of the OMLT will again increase the Belgian 
commitment to Afghanistan, begun after the Leterme government 
and De Crem came into office in March 2008.  Belgian troops 
are now guarding the Kabul airport, and they operate and 
maintain the F-16's in Kandahar.  The F-16's have seen some 
action in support of ISAF operations.  When all Belgium's 
troops are in Afghanistan later this year, they will total 
about 500 soldiers in all.
