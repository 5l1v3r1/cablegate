¶A.        Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent 
Reporting Period 
 
1)      Mar 2 -   EXBS Advisor coordinated and attended 
meeting between Turkish Nuclear Experts at Cekmece Research 
Center and U.S. Nuclear Experts from Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory  The meeting was a follow-up to the 2006 
meetings concerning forensic testing of LEU seized by Turkish 
National Police in 2005.  The U.S. and Turkish Atomic Energy 
Authority have been cooperating in attempts to determine the 
origin of the LEU and possible route/method by which it could 
have been brought to Turkey.  Also discussed were latest 
advances in nuclear forensic testing and additional areas of 
cooperation. 
 
2)       Mar 6 - EXBS Advisor met with Customs Enforcement 
Deputy Director General Mehmet Guzel to finalize the planning 
for the Turkish Customs delegation which will participate in 
the International Border Interdiction Training later in the 
month.  EXBS Advisor also discussed dates for a visit by a 
CBP training expert to begin coordination with Turkish 
Customs in the development of their new training academy. 
Guzel informed EXBS Advisor that this project has created 
increased interest through Turkish Customs and that it has 
shifted to the External Affairs Directorate for coordination. 
 Finally, EXBS Advisor reviewed the status of the equipment 
which is ready for delivery to Turkey for use by Turkish 
Customs and awaiting final implementation procedures by the 
GOT for shipping. 
 
3)       Mar 8-      EXBS Advisor met with MFA Arms Control 
and Disarmament Head of Department Serhan Yigit to discuss 
current projects in Turkey, including Internal Control 
Program (ICP), Commodity Identification Training (CIT) and 
Second Line of Defense (SLD). EXBS Advisor updated Yigit on 
activities that are being planned with Turkish Foreign Trade 
Undersecretariat concerning the ICP projects and also the 
training that Turkish Customs officials will attend in 
McAllen Texas.  Yigit commented that, while this increased 
cooperation between US and Turkey is beneficial, we should be 
aware that the GOT must complete the implementation law for 
the NP Agreement before we can fully engage in all activities 
covered by the Agreement.  EXBS Advisor agreed and informed 
Yigit that all activities planned are either general in 
nature or assist in preparing for full engagement in the near 
future. 
 
4)      Mar 13- 14- EXBS Advisor conducted program 
consultations in Washington DC with representatives from 
ISN/ECC, ISN/CPI, ISN/CTR, DOE/INECP, DOE/SLD, CBP and DOC 
personnel.  EXBS Advisor provided updates on program and all 
projects underway in Turkey, along with planning for future 
activities.  ISN/ECC reviewed planning for future projects 
and development of a proposed schedule of activities to 
increase engagement with Turkey following the ratification of 
the NP Cooperation Agreement. 
 
5)     Mar 21 - EXBS Advisor met with MFA Arms Control and 
Disarmament Head of Department Serhan Yigit to review 
information from DC consultations and to begin scheduling for 
upcoming events, including Wisconsin Risk Report review, High 
Level Nuclear Smuggling discussions and DOE meetings with 
TAEK.  Yigit  stated while MFA is prepared to move forward 
 
ANKARA 00000840  002 OF 003 
 
 
with several of the EXBS projects, there is still some 
concern about getting too far in front of the Prime Ministry 
as it completes the law required to implement the NP 
Cooperation Agreement.  Once this required law is completed, 
the NP Agreement will be in force and all programs can move 
forward.  Yigit did emphasize that MFA supports the efforts 
to provide new SLD equipment to replace the currently 
installed equipment and that they have notified Turkish 
Customs of this fact. 
 
6)     Mar 22- 23 - EXBS Advisor conducted departure briefing 
with Turkish Customs delegation traveling to the United 
States to participate in the International Border 
Interdiction Training in McAllen Texas. 
 
7)     Mar 26 -   EXBS Advisor met with Customs Enforcement 
Deputy Director General Mehmet Guzel to further discuss the 
proposed training opportunities for Turkish Customs officials 
with CBP.  EXBS Advisor presented an invitation for Turkish 
officials to participate in the International Rail 
Interdiction Training in June and also began planning for a 
land based Targeting and Risk Management workshop in July. 
Guzel informed EXBS Advisor that they desire to hold the 
workshop in Ankara, which would allow participation by some 
HQ personnel as well as field officials and that the Customs 
Processing Center could be utilized for the practical 
exercises.  EXBS Advisor agreed with the idea and stated they 
would now need to establish a location for the classroom 
discussions and housing of participants. 
 
EXBS Advisor met with new Customs Enforcement Director 
General Hayrettin Cevher.  EXBS Advisor outlined the EXBS 
program and the upcoming cooperation events that are 
scheduled for this year including CBP International 
Interdiction Training, Targeting and Risk Management Workshop

reviewed equipment that was ready to be delivered to Turkey 
for Turkish Customs and stressed to Cevher the importance of
