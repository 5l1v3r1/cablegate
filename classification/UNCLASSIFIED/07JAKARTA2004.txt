REF: STATE 101170 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel query concerning attendance of 
high-level officials at the 62nd session of the United 
Nationa General Assembly (UNGA) in New York in late September 
and early October, contacts at the Indonesian Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) have told us there are tentative 
plans for Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to 
attend the UNGA September 23 and 24.  His attendance would 
occur in connection with a high-level meeting at that time on 
the margins of the UNGA in preparation for the 13th Council 
of Parties on climate change, scheduled to be held in Bali, 
Indonesia, in December.  Should President Yudhoyono not 
attend the climate-change meeting, contacts said, he would 
likely be represented by Indonesian State Minister for the 
Environment Rachmat Nadi Witoelar Kartaadipoetra (Rachmat 
Witoelar being the operative name). 
 
¶2. (SBU) DEPLU contacts confirmed that Indonesian Foreign 
Minister Hasan Wirajuda would also likely attend the UNGA, 
either with President Yudhoyono or as Indonesia's senior 
official. 
 
¶3. (SBU) DEPLU contacts hope to be able to provide more 
detailed information and possibly additional names before 
August 1.
