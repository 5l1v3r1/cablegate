SPECIAL ENVOY DRAWS POSITIVE COVERAGE 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The appointment of George Mitchell as Special Envoy For Middle East 
Peace received highlighted coverage in the Palestinian press.  The 
lead stories in both Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida speculated on 
the meaning of the appointment to the future of the peace process. 
Al-Ayyam's main headline reads, "Obama to deploy Mitchell to the 
region soon, emphasizes commitment to the two-state solution."  The 
paper introduces the story with a close-up photo of President Obama 
standing next to Mitchell.  Similarly, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida combines 
coverage on Mitchell's appointment with the "pressing situation in 
Gaza," declaring, "Obama calls for opening the Gaza crossings, and 
will send Mitchell to the region soon as Middle East envoy." 
 
The largest circulating daily, Al-Quds, carried a front-page feature 
by its Washington-based correspondent under the headline, "Will the 
new Middle East Envoy Mitchell pick up from where the 'Mitchell 
Report' ended?"  The article leads with an upbeat paragraph stating 
that the appointment of Mitchell indicates the American 
administration's strong intent to, "get involved [regionally] in an 
effective manner," to rQolve the Israeli-Arab conflict.  The 
article takes note of the former Senator's success in brokering a 
peace agreement in Northern Ireland and his draft of the "Mitchell 
Report" on the Middle East in April 2001, which included 
recommendations that Israel stop its settlement activities and 
remove its checkpoints in the West Bank. 
 
In separate front-page coverage, the dailies quoted remarks made by 
a Hamas' member in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, regarding Mitchell's 
appointment.  According to Hamdan, "some" Palestinians were 
optimistic over Mitchell's appointment as Middle East envoy. 
However, given Obama's unwillingness to deal directly with Hamas, 
"it seems that, even before appointing [Mitchell] officially, 
[Obama] has tried to put a stick in the spokes of the wheel, perhaps 
to ensure that (Mitchell) does not succeed." 
 
Palestinian online news agencies highlighted coverage of Mitchell's 
appointment.  The lead story on the largest Palestinian news 
website, Ma'an News Agency, featured an article entitled, "Obama 
appoints former Ireland negotiator as America's top envoy."  The 
article, referring to remarks by Mitchell, states that the envoy, 
"does not underestimate the difficulty of this assignment," 
acknowledging the "danger" of getting involved in the Palestinian 
struggle for self-determination.  Another Palestinian online 
service, the Palestine News Network (PNN), carried a Reuters report 
featuring a biography of Mitchell on its homepage.
