SUBJECT: POSSIBLE ITALIAN AND SWISS MRE PROVIDERS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 175147 
 
Econ Specialist contacted Italy's Department of Civil 
Protection and was given the contact information of four 
Italian companies that supply meals ready to eat.  One 
company indicated that it could not supply MREs in the 
numbers requested.  Two of the Italian firms gave us partial 
quotes.  The fourth firm passed our inquiry directly to its 
Swiss partner, which provided a detailed quote reported below 
and could deliver MREs within 4-6 weeks.  Embassy Bern may 
wish to follow up with the Swiss firm, if they prove to be a 
likely source of MREs.

but they need more information on where and how the meals 
would be delivered before quoting a price and committing to a
