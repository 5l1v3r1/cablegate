Health Center Dedication

¶2.  Ambassador and USAID Mission Director Mike Sarhan visited 
the Medghil Health Center to dedicate a recently completed 
USD 193,000 wing funded by USAID.  Abdul Karim Rase, Minister 
of Health, and Ares Zuki, Governor of Marib, were also on 
hand. All were welcomed by the sheikh of the local tribe, 
Rebeesh Mabchout Bin Kelaan.  The sheikh applauded USG 
assistance in the expansion of the clinic and thanked the 
Ambassador for community support. He confirmed that the USG 
would remain committed to the development of the area.

¶3.  Results of the USAID funded Health Facility Survey were 
presented at the Governorate Auditorium of Marib. Ambassador 
remarked on the commitment of both the USG and ROYG to 
provide health care for Yemen's children, even in the most 
remote areas.  The Governor and the Health Minister stressed 
that the USG funding of the President's Hospital demonstrates 
USG's continuing support for the community. 
 
¶4.  After the presentation, Ambassador presented keys for a 
Toyota Hi-Lux truck to Governor Zuki. The USAID-funded 
vehicle will enable the Marib Health Office to conduct 
supervisory visits, provide in-service training, and 
distribute supplies as needed. Ambassador received a warm 
thank you from Abdrabo Muftah, Director General of Health, 
Marib Health Office.

¶5.  From the Health Center, the party moved on to tour the 
President's Hospital. The hospital was funded by USDA 416(b) 
proceeds (reftel), and is equipped with state of the art 
diagnostic and treatment facilities. The hospital is 
partially operational, but has not officially opened. 
 
¶6.  Next the Ambassador visited the MHI to observe the 
USAID-funded training program for midwives. There were two 
classes in session during the visit, and a total of 45 
midwife trainees were present. Their graduation is set for 
2007, after which they will work in small health facilities 
serving rural Marib and village communities. Ambassador 
wished them well and congratulated them for their efforts.

ROYG-funded Facilities Visited

¶7.  Ambassador accompanied the Minister of Health on visits 
to the ROYG-funded Health Center Shaheed Mohammed Hayel and 
the al-Shawban Health Center. Both facilities are 
operational, well staffed and equipped and appear to be 
serving clients in an orderly and professional manner. 
 
¶8.  COMMENT: USG efforts on improving health care 
administration and facilities are proving to be successful 
venues for the achievement of development and public 
diplomacy goals in Yemen.  The facilities supported by USAID 
and USDA Food Aid funding are recognized and welcomed as 
tangible proof of USG commitment to improving the health and 
welfare of the people of Yemen. END COMMENT.
