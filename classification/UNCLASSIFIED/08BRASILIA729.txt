Mission delivered the reftel nonpaper during a May 27 
briefing to a Brazilian Ministry of External Affairs (MRE) 
team led by Special Advisor Marcos Pinta Gama.  The 
Brazilians expressed interest in the overall concept of a 
maritime partnership but were curious as to what specific 
programs the U.S. might be considering for Brazilian and 
South American participation.  The flexibility of the 
proposed partnership and its applicability to a country such 
as Brazil which depends on seaborne trade for its prosperity 
were also important considerations. The Brazilian side 
identified drug trafficking, piracy and security of the 
Panama Canal as important regional issues but was unable to 
give an immediate answer as to whether Brazil would join the 
GMP.
