MISS 
 
¶1.  Deauville France will host the second annual Women's Forum for 
the Economy and Society, October 5-7, 2006.  The United States was 
underrepresented at this event last year, and I ask your help to 
take full advantage of this opportunity this year. 
 
¶2.   The Forum (www.womens-forum.com) is a major international 
colloquium aimed at enhancing women's role in economic and social 
decision-making worldwide.  It is led by a group of high-powered 
French and European women who aspire to create a "women's Davos" 
where professional men and women from developed and developing 
countries gather annually to discuss how women can better contribute 
to meeting the challenges facing their societies.  The Forum 
provides participants an opportunity to network, exchange ideas, and 
learn from one another.  The inaugural meeting, held in October 
2005, was a big success organizationally, in terms of participation, 
and follow-up.  The group has now opened an office in Washington as 
well. 
¶3. This year's event is entitled:  The "Women's Forum for the 
Economy and Society:  Building the Future with Women's Vision."  The 
organizers expect 800 participants to attend, including businessmen 
and women, political leaders, NGO leaders, academics, and cultural 
figures.  Confirmed attendees include Karen Elliot House, Senior 
Vice-President of Dow Jones & Co, USA; Nancy Barry, President of 
Women's World Banking; Mary Lou Jepsen, Chief Technology officer at 
the MIT; Christine Ockrent, French journalist and co-author of "Le 
Livre Noir de la Condition des Femmes"; Noraini Abdullah, Managing 
Director, Asian Global Business, Malaysia; Patricia Hewitt, 
Secretary of State in the UK Ministry of Health; Anne-Marie Lizin,

President of the Belgian Senate; Belinda Stronach, Member of 
Parliament, Canada; and Zainah Anwar, Co-founder of Sisters in 
Islam, Malaysia. There are a number of high-level U.S. and European 
private sector sponsors. 
¶4.  This event offers an excellent platform for us to set out our 
global democracy and development agendas, with the added opportunity 
to make points on literacy, education, and a range of areas where we 
need new global partners.  Of course, if you were able to 
participate, it could be in conjunction with a concentrated 
bilateral program here in France. 
¶5.  This is worth your time, and I hope we can program one of you. 
Our POC here is PAO Renee Earle.  Best regards.
