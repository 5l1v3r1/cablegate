¶1.  As noted Ref A, UAE Deputy Prime Minister Sheikh Hamdan bin 
Zayed, who is head of the UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA) and 
Chairman of the UAEG's Foreign Aid Coordination Committee, called an 
emergency meeting of donor countries and international relief 
organizations to discuss Gaza on January 12.  Under the banner of 
"Donors Meeting -- Humanitarian Situation in Gaza Strip," about 40 
embassies and 20 aid agencies discussed key humanitarian 
priorities. 
 
¶2.  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr. Anwar Gargash chaired 
the main session, citing the urgency of "all forms" of humanitarian 
relief, both immediate and in preparation for the "day after" a 
cessation of hostilities.  Reviewing UAE contributions (see Ref A), 
he noted in particular 318 million dirham raised in a weekend 
telethon, a commitment to rebuild 1300 houses (and select mosques), 
and ongoing RCA donations.  Gargash commended the broad variety of 
donors who need to "stand together, not stand still."  Gaza's 
"unspeakable suffering" requires coordinated and concrete efforts by 
countries, NGOs, and individuals.  He praised humanitarian relief 
workers -- the "unsung heroes for an area that has suffered too 
long" -- and cited his own visits to Gaza in "happier times" which 
he hoped would return. 
 
¶3.  Briefings by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA), UNRWA, and the ICRC put the crisis in context with 
references to an 18-month blockade preceding military operations, 
difficult circumstances for aid delivery, and intense need for 
electricity, fuel, shelter, water, food, medicine, and cash.  Each 
organization characterized its projected requirements (as did the 
WFP in its intervention) and noted that cash is preferable to 
in-kind assistance.  (UNRWA referred to the withholding of cash, or 
the "Israeli cash weapon," as crippling the Gaza economy.)  These 
needs transcend the immediate crisis and will be compounded by "day 
after" requirements for trauma counseling, housing, infrastructure 
rebuilding, school supplies, job creation, and sanitation.  The 
dilemma is "as basic and as tragic" as a family that cannot afford a 
funeral, noted the UNRWA representative.  The Ambassador's 
intervention focused on U.S. support for UNRWA, WFP, and ICRC 
(drawing on Department fact sheets). 
 
¶4.  All briefers expressed appreciation for the UAEG's initiative in 
mobilizing (and funding) relief efforts.  Many interventions 
expressed similar thanks to the UAEG and noted country-specific 
commitments.  (Interventions were made by the Czech, Jordanian, 
Norwegian, Syrian, and U.S. ambassadors, as well as representatives 
from WFP, Dubai Cares, UNICEF, and UNOPS).  Dr. Gargash concluded by 
noting that a summary of the proceedings would be prepared and 
inviting participants to continue the conversation with Sheikh 
Hamdan later that evening. 
 
¶5.  The Ambassador joined the evening discussion with Sheikh Hamdan, 
which was an opportunity to reinforce the themes of the conference 
and express solidarity with the humanitarian needs of Gaza.  One UN 
participant told the Ambassador that as a means of encouraging 
increased donations to the UN system from donor (and particularly 
Gulf) countries, the "donor conference" was certainly welcome. 
 
¶6.  Comment: By focusing the collective minds of a group of donors 
and agencies on issues that each is individually seized with 
already, the meeting was a welcome reminder of the massive effort 
underway and the even more massive requirements on the horizon.  It 
also clearly identified cash contributions to UN agencies (UNRWA in 
particular) and the Red Crescent as the more efficient means of 
getting aid resources applied where most needed.  End comment.
