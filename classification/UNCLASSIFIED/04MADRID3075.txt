¶1.  On August 5 we demarched the Spanish Foreign Ministry 
(MFA) encouraging Spain to make a strong statement condemning 
hostage taking and murder in Iraq (reftel).  Assistant 
Secretary Burns raised the issue with Foreign Minister 
 
SIPDIS 
Moratinos August 8, and Moratinos requested a copy of 
Ambassador Boucher's August 4 statement on Iraq.  We 
delivered the statement to FM Moratino's office on August 9, 
and on August 10, the MFA issued a strong communique 
condemning kidnappings and killings in Iraq.  An unofficial 
translation of the MFA statement follows. 
 
¶2.  Text of August 10 MFA Communique: 
 
The Government wishes to express its deep concern for the 
wave of kidnappings and killings that have devastated Iraq in 
the last few months.  Such criminal acts affect third-country 
nationals whose only wish is to participate in the 
reconstruction of Iraq and the return to normality in 
civilian life, are direct attacks against the security and 
stability of the whole of Iraqi society, and delay the full 
incorporation of Iraq into the international community. 
 
All this leads the Government to express its most robust 
condemnation against the recent kidnappings and 
assassinations, as well as the blackmail of governments and 
contract businesses, whose citizens and workers have been the 
victims of such acts.  In addition, the Government reiterates 
its firm willingness to contribute, within the framework of 
the international community, to the stability, 
democratization, reconstruction, and territorial integrity of 
Iraq.
