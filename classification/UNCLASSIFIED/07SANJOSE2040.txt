SUBJECT: COSTA RICA: TITLE III SUSPENSION OF THE LIBERTAD ACT 
 
REF: A)STATE 158768, B) SAN JOSE 1061 
 
¶1.  The Costa Rican government remains one of the region's leading 
critics of the Castro regime and a strong advocate for democratic 
change and human rights reforms in Cuba.  Costa Rica shows no signs 
that it would consider re-establishing diplomatic relations with the 
Castro government, which were severed in 1961.  The USG should 
encourage and bolster Costa Rica's continued support for democracy 
in Cuba.  Suspending Title III of the Libertad Act in regard to 
Costa Rica remains in the USG national interest. 
 
¶2.  Costa Rican criticism of the Cuban government has continued 
throughout the past six months.  Jose Manuel Echandi, a member of 
Costa Rica's legislative body, took special interest in the case of 
an imprisoned dissident, Normando Hernandez.  (One of Echandi's 
principal advisers is a Cuban expatriate.)  Per the legislator's 
request, the Costa Rican immigration authority granted Hernandez 
permission to enter the country for health reasons.  After the Costa 
Rican consul in Havana went to visit the imprisoned dissident in 
May, the Cuban authorities transferred Mr. Hernandez to a more 
restrictive prison, prompting the Costa Rican legislator to announce 
that he would sue Cuba at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.  In 
July, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias confirmed that his 
administration would not reestablish diplomatic relations with 
Castro's government. 
 
¶3.  The following responses are keyed to Ref A questions: 
 
A) Post is unaware of any Costa Rican investments in Cuba. 
B) Post is unaware of any bilateral trade agreements between Costa 
Rica and Cuba. 
C) Post is unaware of any exchange programs between Costa Rica and 
Cuba.  A limited number of Costa Rican students have accepted 
scholarships to study medicine and film in Cuba, but Post is unaware 
of any formal exchange or scholarship programs between Cuban and 
Costa Rican universities.  Post is unaware of any Costa Ricans who 
have traveled to Cuba for medical treatment, given the availability 
of publicly subsidized health care in Costa Rica.  At any given 
time, there are between six and ten Cuban doctors working in Costa 
Rican hospitals, most of them providing radiological treatment at 
Hospital Mexico in San Jose. 
D) Costa Rica has worked to promote democracy and human rights in 
Cuba.  These efforts include the above actions by Diputado Jose 
Manuel Echandi and President Arias's public statements in July and 
earlier (see reftel B). 
E) Since our last Title III Suspension Report (in June, Ref B), 
there have been no/no high-level Costa Rican diplomatic visits to 
Cuba or high-level Cuban diplomatic visits to Costa Rica.
