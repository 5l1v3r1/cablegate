¶1.  Mission received the GOM response to the proposed 
Shiprider Agreement via Diplomatic Note No. 5953, dated July 
¶13.  The GOM has concurred with the Shiprider Agreement, 
which will be in effect July 16-28, 2009.  The language 
conformed to the requested language in the embassy,s 
original diplomatic note (Reftel) in all but a few minor 
details.  Following careful review of the French-language 
text, Mission assesses this response meets USG requirements. 
 
¶2.  Mission was informed that the GOM will maintain the lead 
for all boardings conducted in Morocco,s territorial waters. 
 This was explained at the C6F Planning meeting in Rabat.  It 
will also command for purposes of safety of navigation. 
 
¶3.  Mission is disappointed that the P-3 that had been 
envisioned to enhance the efficacy of this operation is no 
longer available and that notice of the withdrawal of the P-3 
was only received on July 15.  We are nonethless pleased that 
the Legare can participate in an operation vice an exercise.
