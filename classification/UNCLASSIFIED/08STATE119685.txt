The Embassy of the United States wishes to remind the 
Government of Syria that under Article 36 
of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the 
Government of Syria has an obligation to notify 
the United States Embassy, which provides consular services 
to U.S. citizens in Syria, when a detained 
American citizen requests to speak with a U.S. consular 
officer.  The Embassy requests the Government 
of the Syrian Arab Republic notify the U.S. Embassy in 
Damascus promptly when an American citizen has 
been arrested and  calls on the Government of Syria to 
provide U.S. consular officers prompt access 
to detained American citizens, as required by Article 36. 
 
(Insert appropriate complimentary closing.)

¶3. Background:  On October 8, following extensive media 
coverage of the disappearance of journalists 
Taylor Luck and Holli Chmela, Embassy Damascus and the 
Department learned that these two Americans had been 
in Syrian custody since October 1.  Upon learning of their 
detention, Embassy Damascus immediately proceeded 
to arrange consular access.  Shortly after their detention on 
October 1, the two requested to speak with 
Embassy Damascus as well as with their families.  Under 
Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 
the Syrian government should have notified Embassy Damascus 
immediately.  In an October 16 meeting with the Syrian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, CDA Connelly expressed concerns 
with delayed notification and access to detained 
American citizens.
