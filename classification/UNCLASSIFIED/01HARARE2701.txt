SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION LAND REFORM IN ZIMBABWE - 
ABUJA ACCORD; HARARE 
 
 
¶1.   THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" 
    DEDICATED ITS SEPTEMBER 13 EDITORIAL TO THE ABUJA LAND 
    ACCORD BROKERED BY NIGERIA.  UNDER HEADLINE "BEYOND 
    ABUJA," THE PAPER COMMENTS: 
 
¶2.   ". . .IN SIGNING UP TO ABUJA, MUGABE MAY INDEED 
    SEE THE PACT AS GIVING HIM BREATHING SPACE IN THE FACE 
    OF IMMINENT AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN SANCTIONS AGAINST 
    HIM AND HIS TOP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS.  BUT THE 
    REALITY ON THE GROUND - IN TERMS OF TIMING - IS THAT 
    THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TRAPPED BY THE INTERNATIONAL 
    COMMUNITY TO FINALLY SHOW HIS TRUE COLORS BY FULLY 
    DELIVERING ON THE LAST-DITCH ACCORD. . .  UNTIL HE 
    MOVES ON THESE CRITICAL ISSUES, FUNDING WILL CLEARLY 
    REMAIN ELUSIVE - JUST AS BEFORE ABUJA. . .  SOMEHOW HE 
    MUST WALK A TIGHT ROPE AND JUST HOPE AND PRAY NOT TO 
    STUMBLE AND FALL BY THE WAYSIDE.  WHILE WE TAKE NOTE 
    OF HIS RARE COURAGE TO TRY TO REVERSE ZIMBABWE'S 
    DESCENT INTO ANARCHY. . .HE MUST NOW RAPIDLY TRANSLATE 
    THE AGREEMENT INTO VISIBLE ACTION. . .  IT WOULD BE A 
    GOOD GESTURE IF THE PRESIDENT TOOK DECISIVE ACTION 
    IMMEDIATELY SO THAT, BY THE TIME HE ATTENDS THE 
    COMMONWEALTH SUMMIT IN AUSTRALIA NEXT MONTH, HE AND 
    ZIMBABWE WOULD BE BREATHING EASIER AGAIN."
