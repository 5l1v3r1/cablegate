REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated April 17, 2009 B) D411730 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) attempted 
to conduct a pre-license check (PLC) at Blue Nova/Shenzhen Emission 
Technology, 2/F, No 58, Second Street, Sai Yin Pun, Hong Kong (Blue 
Nova).  The item in question for this PLC is a power amplifier 
controlled under ECCN 3A001 that is the subject of U.S. export 
license application number D411730.  The license applicant is Volkin 
Electronics of Boca Raton, Florida. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Blue Nova has 
been in existence since July 2008.  The company has no paid-in share 
capital.  Its directors are Iranian national, Mirhadi, Seyed 
Mohammad (PP#A10582269) and Chinese National Yang Junping 
(PP#G12632330). 
 
¶4.  According to the company's apparent web site 
(www.bluenova.com.hk), the company is a Hong Kong based import and 
export company.  The web site lists products such as consumer 
electronic products, toys, fruits and gas ovens.  A web search of 
Shenzhen Emission Technology (the stated end-user) reveals that this 
company markets itself as a computer network technology services and 
systems integration provider.  This company also appears to share a 
phone number with Shenzhen Dahe-IC Electronic Co., Ltd., an 
electronics reseller (www.dahe-ic.com). 
 
¶5.  On April 17, 2009, Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan attempted to 
schedule the PLC.  A representative of Blue Nova stated that because 
of the delay in receiving the item, Blue Nova had cancelled the 
order.  Based on guidance from OEA, ECO has stopped further action 
on this PLC request.  ECO can therefore also not render a 
determination on whether Blue Nova is a suitable recipient of U.S. 
origin technology.
