SUBJECT: SPAIN'S STANCE ON JOINING AND CONTRIBUTING TO A 
PARTNERSHIP FOR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE 
 
REF: STATE 108794 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) On September 13, MFA's Deputy Director for 
Multilateral Economic Issues Juan Luis Munoz de Laborde told 
EconOff that Spain would postpone joining or contributing 
financially to the Partnership for Democratic Governance 
(PDG) until it became clearer what role and form the fledging 
organization would take.  Munoz de Laborde said that in 
concept Spain was in favor of the proposal and had been one 
its supporters in the OECD for the July 12 vote to establish 
the organization.  However, he repeated, the GOS was not 
inclined to pledge funding nor join the organization until 
the GOS has a better sense of how the organization would 
materialize in its implementation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In support of the PDG, Econoff noted that 
contributing financially or joining the PDG would allow Spain 
the opportunity to play a role in developing the 
organization's identity and direction.  EconOff explained 
that the US and the PDG steering group partners would roll 
out the PDG at the margin of this year's UN General Assembly 
meeting.  EconOff added that Spain's support would contribute 
to the success of this rollout and the program's efforts to 
assist emerging democracies build governance capacity.  Munoz 
de Laborde expressed appreciation for these and other reftel 
points and agreed to continue the dialogue on this initiative.
