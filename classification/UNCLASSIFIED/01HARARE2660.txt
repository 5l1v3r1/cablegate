¶1.   SEPTEMBER 9 AND 10 EDITORIALS IN THE GOVERNMENT- 
    CONTROLLED WEEKLY "THE SUNDAY MAIL" AND THE INDEPENDENT 
    DAILY "THE DAILY NEWS" FOCUS ON THE NIGERIAN-BROKERED 
    AGREEMENT COVERING THE CONTROVERSIAL LAND REFORM PROGRAM 
    IN ZIMBABWE.  EDITORIAL EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   UNDER HEADLINE "AFTER ABUJA, TIME TO PUT WAR VETS IN 
    THEIR PLACE," THE SEPTEMBER 10 EDITION OF THE "DAILY 
    NEWS" COMMENTS: 
 
    "THE AGREEMENT REACHED BETWEEN ZIMBABWE AND BRITAIN 
    AT THE ABUJA TALKS ON LAND WAS POSSIBLE ONLY BECAUSE 
    THE COMMONWEALTH NATIONS STOOD SOLIDLY AGAINST THE 
    LAWLESSNESS PROMOTED BY THE MUGABE REGIME THROUGH 
    THE SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS.  NONE OF THEM WERE EVER 
    IN DOUBT THAT THE LAND ISSUE HAD TO BE RESOLVED. 
    THE PEOPLE OF ZIMBABWE HAD NEVER DISPUTED THE NEED 
    FOR A LAND REFORM PROGRAM THAT WOULD REDISTRIBUTE 
    LAND SO THAT THE MAJORITY, NOW CONFINED TO 
    OVERCROWDED COMMUNAL AREAS, COULD OWN MOST OF IT. 
    WHAT MOST CRITICS WOULD NOT ACCEPT WAS THE VIOLENCE 
    ACCOMPANYING LAND 
    REFORM. . .ALTHOUGH THE AGREEMENT IN ABUJA HAS BEEN 
    TOUTED AS A BREAKTHROUGH, MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE. 
    THE BALL IS NOW FIRMLY IN MUGABE'S COURT.  THE 
    FUTURE OF THE WAR VETERANS' ROLE IN THE LAND 
    SEIZURES HAS TO BE ADDRESSED FAIRLY URGENTLY IF THE 
    PRESIDENT IS TO SIGNIFY HIS COMMITMENT TO THE ABUJA 
    ACCORDS. . . ."

    COMMENTS: 
 
    "THE BREAKTHROUGH IN THE ABUJA LAND TALKS IS A 
    VICTORY FOR ZIMBABWE AND AFRICA.  FIRST, IT IS AN 
    AFFIRMATION OF THE POSITION THAT ZIMBABWE HAS ALWAYS 
    HELD ON THE LAND QUESTION.  AND SECOND, IT CONFIRMS 
    OUR BELIEF ALL ALONG THAT SOLUTIONS TO AFRICA'S 
    PROBLEMS WILL ONLY COME FROM AFRICANS THEMSELVES. . 
    .BRITAIN HAS UNDERTAKEN ALONGSIDE THE OTHER WESTERN 
    COUNTRIES REPRESENTED AT THE ABUJA MEETING. . .TO 
    MOBILIZE OTHER COUNTRIES AND DONORS TO SUPPORT LAND 
    REFORM IN ZIMBABWE.  SURELY THE BRITISH WILL 
    MOBILIZE NOBODY IF THEY DON'T MOBILIZE THEIR MAJOR 
    ALLAY THE UNITED STATES, AND ALONG WITH IT, THE 
    INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND THE WORLD BANK.  AND 
    FOR THE AMERICANS THE FIRST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO 
    FLUSH DOWN THE TOILET THEIR ILL-CONCEIVED SANCTIONS 
    BILL. . . ."
