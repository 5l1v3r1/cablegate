Background 
---------- 
¶2. (U) In the late 1980,s and early 1990,s a conflict arose 
between Senegal and Mauritania over a border dispute along 
the Senegal River that resulted in violent clashes, human 
rights violations, and the expulsion of 8black8 
Mauritanians to Senegal during the rule of former Mauritanian 
leader Maouya Ould Taya.  Some refugees intermittently 
returned to Mauritania; however, approximately 18-20,000 
remain waiting for assistance and guarantees of their safety. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Most of the refugees have been residing in 
provisional settlements along the Senegal River Valley. 
UNHCR has been called upon to assist with a safe and smooth 
reintegration process.  During the visit, Presidents 
Abdallahi and Wade agreed to repatriate refugees if the 
international community provides support.  President 
Abdallahi also urged Mauritanian citizens to support the 
reinsertion efforts.  On July 19, newspapers reported on a 
communiqu from the Cabinet asserting a Presidential decision 
that the government of Senegal would grant Mauritanian 
refugees Senegalese citizenship if they wished to stay in 
country.  UNHCR Representative Rosaline Idowu confirmed that 
the President had told her as much during a recent meeting. 
The communiqu further stated that those who wished to return 
would receive assistance from both governments.
