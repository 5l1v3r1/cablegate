Summer vacations in Washington, New York and Tennessee 
(We note that the extensive list of places she has visited 
in the U.S. is somewhat misleading.  Ms. Cousins apparently 
went to each place for only about a day or two, spread out 
over her childhood years.  For example, her visit to 
Tennessee was for one day, to see the Nunavut hockey legend 
Jordin Tootoo play.)

NOMINATING-OFFICER: CG Abigail Friedman 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
The Mission in Canada has put a priority on increasing 
contact with representatives of the Northern Canadian 
Territorties.  This nomination supports this Mission goal of 
involving people of influence in the North through the 
Virtual Presence Posts, outreach  and programs.  Letia 
Cousins is Circumpolar Affairs Advisor for the Government of 
Nunavut.  Young, bright and Inuit, Ms. Cousins is widely 
regarded as the future of Nunavut.  She has taken advantage 
of several opportunities to travel the world - most notably 
spending nearly two years working in Africa, with the 
International Red Cross in Swaziland and with UNESCO in 
Zimbabwe.  But she has always come back to Nunavut.  "This 
is where my family is and this is where I will stay," she 
tells us proudly.  This is good news for Nunavut Territory, 
where the brain drain of talented youth is a serious 
problem. 
Letia Cousins is already proving herself a leader among her 
colleagues.  She is on the Board of Directors of the Nunavut 
Youth Abroad program and she is training to be a Nunavut 
Justice of the Peace.  Within the GON, she is the lead 
person in handling official visitors to Nunavut.   She is a 
reliable interlocutor and an energetic supporter of our 
efforts to raise the U.S. profile in Nunavut.  Letia Cousins 
recently returned from a GON mission to Greenland, where she 
represented Nunavut at a conference for future leaders.
