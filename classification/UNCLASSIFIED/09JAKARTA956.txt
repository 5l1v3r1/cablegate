Unofficial Translation 
 
The Department of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Indonesia presents its compliments to the Embassy of the 
United States of America and has the honour to inform the 
latter that the Government of the Republic of Indonesia has 
decided to present the candidature of Ambassador Sudjadnan 
Parnohadiningrat as Director General of the Organization on 
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for the period of 
2010-2014, the discussion of which will be held during the 
57th Session of the Executive Council of the OPCW on 14-17 
July 2009. 
 
Indonesia has played a significant role in the promotion of 
non-proliferation and disarmament as part of its 
long-standing commitment to the maintenance of international 
peace and security.  Indonesia's commitment was shown during 
the negotiations of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), as 
well as in its participation in activities conducted by the 
OPCW, including the submission of its annual declarations and 
on-site industry inspections, and engaging its chemical 
industries in the implementation of the CWC.  As a country 
with significant chemical industries, Indonesia attaches 
great importance to the works of the OPCW as the implementing 
body in achieving the objectives and purposes of the CWC. 
Despite its contribution to, and long support of the CWC, 
Indonesia has not had the opportunity to serve at the senior 
management level of the Technical Secretariat of the OPCW. 
 
Throughout his distinguished Qplomatic career, Ambassador 
Sudjadnan Parnohadiningrat has served in both bilateral and 
multilateral assignments in Geneva, New York, Canberra and 
Washington, DC.  He was actively involved in the negotiation 
process of the CWC at the Conference of Disarmament and 
several other non-proliferation and disarmament conferences. 
He has also demonstrated his organizational and managerial 
skills when serving as Secretary General of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and Secretary to several summit 
conferences, such as the Asia-Africa Summit, Tsunami Summit, 
and ASEAN Summit. 
 
In view of the above, the Government of the Republic of 
Indonesia is convinced that should he be elected, Ambassador 
Sudjadnan Parnohadiningrat would render strong leadership to 
the OPCW in ensuring the full implementation of and 
compliance with all provisions of the CWC by the State 
Parties, as well as promoting international cooperation and 
assistance as stipulated under the CWC. 
 
In this regard, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia 
would like to request the support of the Government of the 
United States of America toward the candidacy of Ambassador 
Sudjadnan Parnohadiningrat as Director General of the OPCW. 
Attached herewith are an Aide Memoire and the CV of 
Ambassador Sudjadnan Parnohadiningrat. 
 
The Department of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Indonesia avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the 
Embassy of the United States of America the assurances of its 
highest consideration.
