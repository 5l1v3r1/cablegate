SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050186457 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050186457 for the export 
of an infrared camera to Canada.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Sensitive commodity and unfamiliar 
end-user High Power Maintenance Ltd.  The company has not 
appeared on any previous license applications, nor have its 
bona fides been verified by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION:  Department requests that Embassy make appropriate 
inquiries to verify the bona fides of unfamiliar foreign 
end-user High Power Maintenance Ltd. and to confirm the 
legitimacy of this proposed transaction.  PM/DTCC also 
requests that post conducts a site visit to the company in 
order to provide Department with an assessment of its 
business operations and on-site security.  Finally, post is 
asked to assess whether the company appears to be a reliable 
recipient of USML items.  If a site visit is not possible, 
please inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item?  Will High 
Power Maintenance Ltd. retain positive control over the 
infrared camera at all times? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export? 
 
END ACTION
