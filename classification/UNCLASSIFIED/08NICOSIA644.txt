SUBJECT: CYPRUS SUPPORTS KEEPING THE PRESSURE ON THE FARC 
 
REF: SECSTATE 77205 
 
 Â¶1.  Per reftel, PolOff demarched Second Secretary Cyril 
Nicolaou, the Americas Desk Officer for the Cypriot MFA, on 
August 5 regarding Cyprus's support for keeping the pressure 
on the FARC.  Nicolaou replied that Cyprus does not support 
the human rights abuses and terrorist acts of the FARC, and 
will join the EU in supporting concerted international action 
to bring an end to the FARC's abuses and to liberate the 
remaining hostages.  Cyprus also supports the July 8 Special 
Session of the OAS Permanent Council declaration that 
denounces "kidnapping as a horrendous crime."   Nicolaou 
confirmed that Cyprus will not offer safe-haven or offer any 
form of material and other support to terrorists.  The GOC 
agrees that the international community should redouble its 
efforts to work with regional and international 
counternarcotics organizations to stem the flow of narcotics 
and limit the FARC's revenue, and commits to work within 
multilateral fora to leverage its relationship with Venezuela 
to obtain Venezuela's commitment for tougher drug 
enforcement, more regional cooperation, and a cessation of 
its support for FARC.
