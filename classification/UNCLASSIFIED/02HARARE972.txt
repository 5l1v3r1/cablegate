¶1.   Under headline "Wade has joined the bootlicking 
   brigade," the government-controlled daily 
   "Chronicle" dedicated its May 22 editorial to 
   denouncing Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade for 
   "discrediting" the outcome Zimbabwe's presidential 
   election.  Excerpts: 
 
¶2.   "Senegalese President Mr. Abdoulaye Wade recently 
   let the cat out of the bag when he joined the chorus 
   led by Britain and its Western allies in discrediting 
   Zimbabwe's presidential elections.  He became the only 
   African head of state to make an adverse statement 
   about the polls that everybody else in their right 
   minds has declared free and fair.  His outburst leaves 
   us wondering what the basis of his opinion is, since 
   his country did not participate in the polls. . .  An 
   old adage says money is the root of all evil.  We know 
   that Mr. Wade has decided to join the bootlicking 
   brigade of countries in the West for a few pieces of 
   silver.  What he appears to be oblivious of is the fact 
   that by becoming the bad apple in the African basket, 
   he has pressed a button of self-destruction.  We would 
   like to advise Mr. Made to lick the boots of his 
   Western masters without dragging the name of Zimbabwe 
   in mud. 
 
   "The Senegalese leader should be warned that 
   history has shown that Western countries are good 
   at using African leaders and dumping them as and 
   when it suits them. . .  We are also aware that 
   these remarks were made against the background of a 
   meeting to promote the New Economic Partnership for 
   Africa's Development (NEPAD).  Maybe Mr. Made was 
   just trying to be a good boy.  We would like to 
   urge African states to avoid being divided by 
   Western countries for the sake of donor funds.  We 
   do not have to sell each other's souls in order to 
   get funding for NEPAD."
