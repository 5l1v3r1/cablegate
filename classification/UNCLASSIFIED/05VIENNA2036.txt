¶1.  (U) EconPolCouns delivered ref (a) demarche on June 17 to 
the Austrian Foreign Ministry's Director (assistant secretary 
equivalent) for the Middle East and Africa, Ralph Scheide. 
 
¶2.  (U) Scheide thanked us for the suggestions, and noted 
that Austria is engaged in several areas which appear on the 
list (such as police training).  Scheide said he was drafting 
a public statement for release when Foreign Minister Ursula 
Plassnik travels to Brussels for the conference.  The 
statement would review Austria's efforts to support Iraq, 
including its forgiveness of 80 percent of Iraq's debt. 
 
¶3.  (U) Scheide said FM Plassnik had asked to make a 
statement at the Iraq Conference under the Rule of Law and 
Public Order agenda item.  In that context, she would make a 
Human Rights manual on CD-ROM available to the Iraqis and 
other delegations.
