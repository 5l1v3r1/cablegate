SUBJECT: DISASTER DECLARATION FOR SEVERE FLOODING IN SANTA CATARINA 
 
¶1. This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. The  Charge has determined, based upon information from 
Brazil's Secretariat for Civil Defense and Santa Catarina State 
Government, that the severe destruction due to recent record 
rains, flooding, and mudslides is of sufficient magnitude to 
warrant USG emergency assistance. 
 
¶3. Continued heavy rains have caused serious flooding affecting 
one-fourth of the state's population.  Eight cities within the state 
are isolated and over 40,000 citizens have been displaced.  65 
deaths have been reported with landslides, mostly in the Itajai 
Valley. 
 
¶4. The  Charge has requested USDOLS 50,000, which will be used to 
purchase emergency supplies and support basic housing repair for 
the most vulnerable families in the hardest-hit municipalities within 
the state.  Funds will be channeled through Caritas Brazil. 
 
¶5. It is not known at this time if additional funds will be 
required.  Disaster Relief Officer (MDRO) will keep OFDA informed 
if any additional requests might be forthcoming.
