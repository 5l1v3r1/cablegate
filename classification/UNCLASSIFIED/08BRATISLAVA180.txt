SUBJECT: SLOVAK RESPONSE TO TURKEY'S CHANGE OF STATUS 
REQUEST AT THE EBRD 
 
REF: SECSTATE 41999 
 
EconOff delivered reftel demarche to Mario Vircik, Director 
of the International Relations Department at the Ministry of 
Finance.  Vircik noted that Slovakia would welcome the review 
of Turkey's request for a change of status as a part of the 
broader strategic review of EBRD's mandate and operations, 
and was encouraged by the U.S. commitment to carry this out 
by the end of the year.  He noted that he did not think 
Turkey would push for an early decision if the GOT knew that 
the U.S. would vote against them.  Despite his support, 
Vircik needed to discuss the matter internally before 
confirming the formal Slovak Government position on the 
issue.
