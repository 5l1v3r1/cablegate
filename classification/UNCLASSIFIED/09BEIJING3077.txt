CHINA'S ECONOMIC AND TRADE MESSAGES AT APEC 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the November 6 joint Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Ministry of Commerce press conference on 
the upcoming Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
Summit in Singapore, MOFCOM Vice Minister Yi 
Xiaozhun outlined China's economic and trade 
messages at APEC: 
 
-- Opposition to trade and investment protectionism: 
APEC member economies should abide by commitments 
made at the G20, and strive to facilitate an early 
economic recovery for the Asia Pacific economies. 
 
-- Doha:  China hopes for continued progress. 
Member economies must build on existing achievements, 
while staying within negotiating modalities of the 
multilateral development agenda. 
 
-- Cooperation on Sustainable Development:  China 
supports environment related goals such as energy 
reduction in its stimulus.  China stands by its 
position on climate change that all developed and 
developing countries have common but differentiated 
responsibilities. 
 
-- Need to achieve Bogor Goals:  Developed economies 
should meet trade and investment liberalization and 
facilitation goals by 2010, while developing 
economies should do so by 2020.  The region's growth 
should not be derailed by the global financial 
crisis. 
 
¶3.  MFA Vice Minister He Yafei observed that 2009 
marks the twentieth anniversary of APEC.  APEC has 
achieved key goals in trade and investment 
liberalization, regional economic integration, and 
common prosperity.  However, VFM He added, "the 
global financial crisis has not ended.  Signs of 
recovery are evident, but recovery is not yet 
established."  The Asia Pacific region is doing 
better than the rest of the world, but key 
challenges facing the region remain:  Doha, 
protectionism, climate change, and energy security, 
among others, VFM He added. 
 
¶4.  Vice Minister He said China's expectations for 
APEC outcomes are: support for a coordinated 
response to the international financial crisis, 
sending a signal against protectionism and in favor 
of growth, further regional economic integration, 
and continued institutional reform of APEC.  He 
added that President Hu will participate in the APEC 
Economic Leaders meeting, the APEC CEO Summit, and 
 
BEIJING 00003077  002 OF 002 
 
 
APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) events.  Hu's 
main focus at the Summit will be on coping with the 
global financial crisis, restoring economic growth, 
tackling climate change, and promoting food and 
energy security. 
 
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VISIT TO CHINA 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  MFA officials also previewed President Obama's 
visit to China November 15-18, with stops in 
Shanghai and Beijing, emphasizing the following 
points: 
 
-- China looks forward to an in-depth exchange on 
Sino-U.S. relations, and regional and global issues. 
This is President Obama's first visit to China. 
 
-- As major economies, China and the U.S. share 
broad common interests and "vast prospects for 
cooperation."  G20 meetings in 2009 have charted the 
course for a "new era" of a positive, cooperative, 
comprehensive relationship for the 21st century that 
involves "expanding areas of common interest". 
 
-- China looks for President Obama's visit to 
reaffirm the new status of bilateral relations. 
U.S.-China exchanges should be maintained at "high 
levels" as should cooperation on economic issues, 
trade, energy, counterterrorism, law enforcement, 
cultural, non-proliferation issues, and military 
exchanges. 
 
-- Additional topics to be discussed during the 
President's visit include global issues such as: the 
international financial crisis, climate change, 
nuclear safety, and food security. 
 
When asked about specifics of the visit, officials 
stated that "programs are still under discussion" 
and "President Obama will meet China's leaders when 
he visits". 
 
MARKET ECONOMY STATUS AND A/D CASES 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  When asked about whether President Obama's visit 
would bring progress on antidumping cases or 
granting of market economy status to China, VM Yi 
expressed China's "great concern" about the U.S. 
Commerce Department's decision November 4 to impose 
antidumping duties on $3.2 billion in 2008 Chinese 
steel exports of oil country tubular goods (OCTG) 
pipe, "the largest ever" case in value terms, he 
said.  He also asserted that such U.S. measures are 
"unfair" trade measures that discriminate against 
Chinese companies. 
 
CHINA'S VIEW OF U.S. ROLE IN ASIA PACIFIC REGION 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶7.  Responding to a question on China's views on the 
need for a U.S. role in the Asia Pacific as 
suggested recently by Singapore's Minister Mentor 
Lee Kwan Yew, VM He Yafei noted that "the U.S. is in 
APEC and a member of the APEC family".  He noted 
that China welcomes the U.S. to "play a constructive 
role in the Asia Pacific region" and it is "natural" 
for the U.S. to play a role here.  At the same time, 
parties should strive not to harm any others' 
interests, and should work to preserve the peace, 
prosperity, and stability of the region.
