¶3. ConGen Barcelona called the Audiencia Provincial de 
Barcelona on 9/12/07 and learned that Dugan Rosalini's case 
has been postponed until sometime in early April, 2008.  The 
case is being handled by the Seccion Novena Penal of the 
Audiencia Provincial de Barcelona (Tel: 93 567 3109).  The 
case number is: Summary Criminal Proceeding 248/06 B.  The 
court clerk told the Consulate that the trial was being 
postponed to "allow the U.S. trial to take place first." 
There is an outstanding Cook County, Illinois judgment, but 
the Embassy is unaware of an ongoing U.S. trial.  Embassy 
requests Department ascertain what possible court proceeding 
the Catalan court clerk might be referring to. 
 
¶4.  EmbOff discussed the case with Ministry of Culture 
International Cooperation Director General Carlos Alberdi on 
9/13/07.  Alberdi told EmbOff that the former Under Secretary 
of Culture, Antonio Hidalgo, was interested in seeking a 
solution.  In fact, this was the reason he asked for a 7/6/07 
appointment with EmbOff.  However, the meeting was cancelled 
because on that day, Minister Carmen Calvo and Under 
Secretary Antonio Hidalgo were replaced by Cesar Antonio 
 
SIPDIS 
Molina and Dolores Carrion respectively.  Alberdi said he 
would discuss the case with the new team, but he did know 
whether they would be especially interested in the issue as 
they are not associated with the Barcelona Forum.
