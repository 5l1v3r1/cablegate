REF: SECSTATE 186916 
 
¶1. (U) Econoff delivered reftel points to MFA America's Desk 
Director Andrzej Jaroszynski and Jacek Losik, Director of the 
Telecommunications Department in the Ministry of 
Transportation.  Initial reaction shows that all is on track 
and Poland plans to ratify the agreement soon.  The U.S.- EU 
GPS-Galileo Agreement has already passed through the Polish 
inter-ministerial council and will be sent to the Council of 
Ministers for approval, and then on to the MFA for official 
ratification.  The Telcoms Department at the Ministry of 
Transport expects that the MFA will receive the agreement for 
ratification by the beginning of December.  Completion of 
ratification will depend on MFA workload. 
 
¶2. (U) It appears from this initial response that there is no 
large legal hurdle as mentioned in reftel.  However, post 
will follow-up for an official response as well as check in 
at the beginning of December to ensure the MFA has received 
the document as planned.
