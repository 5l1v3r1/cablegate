CIA AGENTS SNEAKED INTO DARFUR TO STUDY THE NATURE OF THE 
TRIBES AND THE GEOGRAPHICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REGION 
 
Special sources conveyed to Al-Intibaha that a dangerous 
infiltration process by CIA agents is taking place in 
Darfur region.  The purpose of the infiltration is to 
create a state of security unrest to pave the way for 
intelligence and military operations that serve the 
international forces get in Darfur and support the 
rebels. 
 
The information discloses that the CIA agents were 
deployed under the umbrella of humanitarian affairs in 
different locations in Darfur region, especially in 
south, central, and east Darfur.  This is done 
purposefully to make a topographic survey of the region 
as well as the norms and behaviors of the tribes there in 
order to create disputes among those tribes; also, how to 
find a way to recruit the sons of the hostile tribes to 
join hands with the rebels.  The purpose also is to 
create a state of panic upon the arrival of the 
international forces and spread rumors that such forces 
cannot be resisted. 
 
The information also says that there are already 16 of 
these agents in Darfur, two of them are in Ed Dein area 
and they are black.  The same information states that the 
agents were trained and well prepared.  Reliable sources 
disclosed that humanitarian organizations are used as 
cover for the international intelligence agencies 
activities in Darfur, and that the current sedition and 
war are the making of these agencies. 
 
A leading NCP member stated that the movements of the 
aliens (foreigners) and the American CIA agents in South 
Darfur State have been identified and were not able to 
achieve any success because of the solidarity of the 
internal front.
