¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050183340 and 050183339 for 
the export of International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled 
ground decks, pad wear, and disk brakes to Indonesia.  Post

pending and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Unfamiliar consignee, Also Private 
Limited, and unfamiliar foreign intermediate consignee, 
Deugro PTE LTD. 
 
¶4. ACTION Singapore: The Department requests that Post make 
inquiries with appropriate officials to establish the bona 
fides of Also Private Limited and Deugro PTE LTD in the 
transaction.  Conduct a site visit to assess the companies' 
reliability as recipients of United States Munitions List 
(USML) articles as well as an assessment of the companies' 
on-site security and operations.  If a site visit is not 
possible, please inform the PM/DTCC case officer. 
 
ACTION Jakarta: The Department requests that Post confirm 
that the Foreign End User, the Indonesian Air Force, ordered 
the items listed for the purpose stated on the license 
applications. 
 
The following points are included for guidance: 
 
--Can Also Private Limited provide documentation that 
verifies the end-use of the ground decks, such as a contract 
or purchase order? 
 
--When were Also Private Limited and Deugro PTE LTD 
established and who are their 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of the companies' businesses -- what 
type of items 
do they handle?  Does either company serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among their typical 
customers 
and where are they located? 
 
--Do the companies understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
