(C)  Ambassador spoke with Ivoirian Permanent Representative 
to the United Nations Alcide Dje Dje on reftel topics last 
week.  She emphasized that the no-action motions Iran and 
Burma are likely to raise are a serious problem for the UN 
General Assembly, and the U.S. strongly opposes such motions. 
 Ambassador Dje Dje told Ambassador on November 16 that Cote 
d'Ivoire intends to abstain on the upcoming no-action motions.
