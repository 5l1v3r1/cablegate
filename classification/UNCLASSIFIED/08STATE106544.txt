REF: A. STATE 102405 
     ¶B. KATHMANDU 1068 
 
¶1. This is an action cable -see paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. The Administration and the Department view the deployment 
of 4,000 additional peacekeeping troops from Egypt, Ethiopia, 
and Rwanda to Darfur as one of its highest priorities for the 
remainder of 2008 (ref A).  The Ethiopians and Egyptians were 
originally scheduled to deploy to Darfur in the first quarter 
of 2008, but to date only small advance companies have been 
deployed.  Ethiopia is ready to deploy, thanks in part to 
U.S. training and equipping, and the GoE sent an August 29, 
2008 letter to the UN requesting approval to self-deploy to 
Darfur.  The United States supports this effort.  To date, 
however, no written response from the UN to this proposal has 
been received. 
¶3. Nepal was on the list of original UN-African Union Mission 
in Darfur (UNAMID) troop-contributing countries (TCCs).  Per 
ref B, the GoN maintains its interest in developments 
regarding UNAMID.  The United States has sponsored training 
for 200 Nepal Police and Armed Police Force officers to 
deploy in Formed Police Units (FPUs) to UNAMID.  However, 
perceived opposition by the Government of Sudan (GoS) to 
non-African TCCs may have forced the GoN to reconsider its 
UNAMID pledges.  In the interest of meeting and/or exceeding 
our 4,000-troop goal by the end of December, we are seeking 
for the GoN to once again commit to deploying forces to 
UNAMID. 
 
¶4. ACTION REQUEST: COM is requested to contact high-level 
host government counterparts to assess the readiness of the 
GoN to make good on its previous pledges to UNAMID.  COM 
should urge counterparts to press forward with key steps in 
the deployment process.  These steps most notably include 
preparing a Memorandum of Understanding with the UN and going 
forward with a Pre-Deployment Assessment Visit.  Post is also 
requested to urge government officials to seriously consider 
self-deployment.  Please find out what additional impediments 
remain to deployment and how the USG might be of help toward 
their removal.  NOTE: The USG is not prepared to offer 
specific assistance to the GoN for deployment of its forces, 
but Post is encouraged to consider ways in which the USG 
might help resolve any obstacles to such deployment. 
 
¶5. Please submit response to demarche request by Wednesday, 
October 8, 2008.  For further information on this cable, 
please contact AF/SPG, Emily Bruno, 202-647-5066. 
 
¶6. Minimize considered.
