  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  AFGHAN ELECTION 
 
"Does the second presidential election in Afghanistan represent a 
democratic evolution?"  (pg 3) 
 
21st Century Publishing Company's business newspaper 21st Century 
Business Herald (21 Shiji Jingji Baodao)(08/20): "All of the typical 
characteristics of Western elections, such as intense political 
debates, campaign rallies, and even televised debates, are emerging 
in this year's elections in Afghanistan.  But can this form of 
democracy really reduce conflicts and lead Afghans to prosperity? 
Continuous terrorist attacks have shown that the election is still 
'a trial of democracy amidst the sound of gunshots.'  In addition, 
the U.S. and the UK have had an influence and a role in the 
election, so this is more than just the Afghan people's election. 
The cooperation of the U.S. and the UK with Karzai's government in 
the War on Terror and in cracking down on the Taliban is in fact a 
type of tacit support for Karzai.  No matter what types of worries 
surround this election, it represents an opportunity for Afghans to 
unfold their new lives.  In fact, more and more Afghans are 
beginning to believe that their votes can bring change." 
 
¶2.  CHINESE IMMIGRATION TO U.S. 
 
"40,000 Chinese became U.S. citizens last year" (pg 16) 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(08/20): "China is the fourth largest source 
country for foreigners who become the U.S. citizens.  The Chinese 
public still has mixed feelings about Chinese celebrities becoming 
citizens of foreign countries.  People's opinions differ on whether 
this represents a loss of Chinese talent or a sign of China's 
integration with the world.  Wang Limin, an immigration specialist, 
said that the U.S. is an attractive destination for many Chinese 
immigrants because of its good living conditions and social 
benefits.  U.S. immigration policy no longer focuses strictly on 
'talent,' but now also focuses on [prospective immigrants'] 
'financial capability.'  Americans do not think that 40,000 Chinese 
becoming U.S. citizens is that big of a deal.  They think Chinese 
immigrants are generally very talented and are happy to accept them. 
 Zhang Shengjun, a professor at Beijing Normal University, said that 
the Chinese, because of their special historical and cultural 
traditions, are a special group of people.  Chinese living overseas 
have brought back foreign techniques and capital to China and have 
helped to create a better, more foreign-friendly environment in 
their country.  The fact that Chinese immigrate to other countries 
has created a positive trend, which now requires China to have a 
good environment for economic development to attract talented 
Chinese living overseas to come back to China." 
 
¶3.  CHINA'S PUBLIC RELATIONS STRATEGY 
 
"China needs to find a more acceptable way to get its message heard 
in the West" (pg 14) 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(08/20): "Though Chinese and Australian media 
are criticizing each other over [Uyghur activist] Rebiya Kadeer's 
invitation to Australia, many Australians do not care about the 
issue at all.  The ineffective communication between China and 
Australia is obviously the crux of the problem.  Foreign countries 
have not come to the conclusion that Rebiya is a criminal based on 
the '7.5' (July 5) incident in Xinjiang, including Australians, who 
do not think Rebiya is a terrorist.  Westerners are accustomed to 
draw their own conclusions based on information they collect through 
various channels.  China cannot prevent Westerners from watching 
programs that glorify Rebiya.  Westerners will not realize that 
Rebiya is a criminal until China lets them make up their own minds 
based on hearing both sides of the story.  China must do more to get 
its side of the story heard by reaching out to larger audiences 
through a variety of methods, including the Internet, audio and 
video products, books, and other media.  In this way, China can try 
to diminish Western prejudice on the Xinjiang issue."
