  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "The U.S. voices 'emphasizing China' have suddenly increased" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/12): "The U.S. Department of the Treasury 
has issued its last review on foreign exchange rate policy before 
the close of the Bush Administration. In this report, China has not 
been listed as a country that manipulates its exchange rate. 
Analysts think that China is not listed because the present 
administration would like to avoid creating difficulties for the new 
government. Therefore, the Bush Administration avoided offending 
China before leaving the White House. At the same time, the U.S. 
media has increasingly voiced the fact that it believes the U.S. and 
China are coming closer. The world setup is complicated. China is a 
new player in this game of chess whose foundation is not yet stable. 
China needs to listen to other country's evaluations of itself. The 
recent positive comments by the U.S. on China are much better than 
the recent negative French comments about China. However, Chinese 
analysts are concerned about how long the U.S.-China relationship 
will be coming closer and closer, and how far the relationship will 
go." 
 
b. "The U.S. relationship with China enters a time when it is like a 
'man in his 30s'" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/12): "It is interesting to look at the 
Development of U.S.-China relations, since the establishment, from 
the perspective of American Think-tanks. Looking deeply at the 
Think-tank's reports over the last three decades, one can see the 
gradual maturity of the U.S. Government's policies on China. 
Compared to the U.S. think-tanks' opinions on China in 1980s and 
1990s, 'the theory of a complicated China' in 21st century reflects 
the passion, confusion and caution usually seen in men nearing the 
age of 30. This mentality leads to more issues between the two 
countries that must be dealt with in the next 10 years. It is 
therefore hoped that the bilateral relationship will be more mature 
in the next 10 years." 
 
¶2. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"China is not yet capable of influencing the World" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/12): "The current U.S. financial crisis 
provides China an opportunity. China needs to make use of this 
opportunity to enlarge its international influence. It's important 
for China to correctly recognize and use the current opportunity. 
China needs to have an appropriate evaluation on it's strength and 
position. The most urgent task for China is not enlarging its 
international influence, but to solve problems in its own 
international and sustainable development. What's more, China needs 
to correctly recognize the U.S. situation and direction. The U.S. is 
facing an adjustment, but will not decline. Furthermore, China 
should be aware of how newly-rising countries transfer their 
strength into influence, making use of the opportunities. ...China 
should gradually expand its influence into the international society 
through the international system. Based on the principle of 
consistent duties and rights, China will bear more international 
responsibility and require more rights for its own opinions at the 
same time."
