  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "China should think more broadly than the west" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/23): "Some people believe that democracy 
is a general value globally. However, this is a theoretical law. 
Democracy is not a value. It is a political method that could be 
used to express public choices. Democracy is an ancient invention. 
However, the ancient philosophers opposed democracy because it can 
easily lead to tyranny. Only during the Cold War did democracy 
become a universal value and a political tactic. China's universal 
value is closely related to the concept of 'land under sky.' China 
believes that the world is one big family. China believes that there 
is a way for all countries to cooperate harmoniously. China also 
believes that there is a way for various nations and cultures to 
coexist in the 'land under sky' philosophy. Instead of criticizing 
the west, China should pay more attention to how it can improve 
itself, perhaps imitating the west by combining all its positive 
values. 
 
b. "The U.S. prints a ridiculous advertisement attacking China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/23): "The Washington Post recently printed 
an advertisement that portrays China as a credit card.  The 
advertiser intended to show that today, Americans have to depend on 
China's charity to stay afloat.   Chinese experts say that this 
shows that the Americans feel lost in the financial crisis. This is 
an odd way for the U.S. to criticize China. This is an action by 
certain American Interest groups. Although it isn't the government's 
stance, this ad will put pressure on Obama's China policy. Because 
China is the largest creditor for the U.S., Americans like to 
compare themselves to the Chinese. The U.S. worries that China will 
catch-up with America's progress. Chinese analysts indicate that the 
direct cause of an advertisement like this is that not all classes 
in the U.S. benefit from the U.S.-China economic relationship. The 
sponsors of the advertisement, the American Business and Industry 
Committee, represent the small and medium sized American 
manufacturing enterprises. Their goal was to urge the U.S. 
government to change the situation in America." 
 
¶2. CHINESE BLOGGERS 
 
"Critical bloggers [arrested] on defamation charges" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (04/23): "A 
Sichuan man who described local officials as 'scum of the nations' 
is among two Chinese citizens before the courts charged with 
defaming government officials. The man was initially jailed for one 
year for another 'defaming' post, and is now serving a sentence of 
two years for his most recent 'defaming' posts." 
 
¶3. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
 
"Poison to quench thirst" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (04/23): "It is 
absurd and unimaginable for the provincial environmental protection 
department to keep the names of polluting enterprises a secret at a 
meeting on pollution control. What they have done is against the 
regulations on discloser of government information that took effect 
last May. Confidentiality is by no means the reason. Suggested 
reasons include; the polluting firms may be contributing to local 
finance revenue or the firms may have bribed the environmental 
watchdog."
