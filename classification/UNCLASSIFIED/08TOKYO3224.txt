SUBJECT: JAPAN FM STATEMENT SUPPORTS OUTCOME OF RECENT 
GEORGIA TALKS 
 
On Nov. 20, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone 
issued a statement of support for the international talks on 
Georgia: 
 
"The Government of Japan welcomes that certain progress was 
seen at the occasion of the second International Discussions 
on Georgia which was held in Geneva on November 19 through 
constructive attitudes made by all the participants. 
 
It is a positive step towards a resolution of the issues in 
the region that direct talks by the parties concerned have 
taken place for the first time after the conflict in Augst 
and that there were productive discussions on issues such as 
incident prevention mechanism and the return of refugees and 
IDP (Internally Displaced Persons). 
 
The Government of Japan has supported consistently a peaceful 
resolution of this issue based on the principle of 
territorial integrity in accordance with international law. 
It also continues to expect that the issues concern South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia will be solved in a manner that can be 
accepted by the international community through such 
international discussions."
