SUBJECT: PM MANNING REPORTEDLY HAS SUCCESSFUL SURGERY IN CUBA 
 
REF: PORT OF SPAIN 567 
 
¶1.  On December 17, Prime Minister Patrick Manning underwent a 
two-hour surgery at the Cimeq Hospital in Havana to remove a 
malignant tumor from his left kidney (ref).  According to a press 
release from the Prime Minister's office, Manning's surgery was 
"very successful."  Doctors will perform a pathology exam to 
determine what, if any, additional treatment is required.  The media 
report a significant outpouring of good wishes, prayer and support 
for the PM from party members, local citizens and even opposition 
backers. 
 
¶2.  Up to the time of his surgery, Manning remained in contact with 
various Ministers and was said to be fully aware of daily government 
business.  Manning expects to remain in Cuba until early January for 
post-operative care and will not likely campaign for the People's 
National Movement (PNM) before the January 19 local elections for 
the Tobago House of Assembly take place.
