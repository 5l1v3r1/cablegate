¶1. (U) This is an action request - please see paragraph five. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: Marisol Maria Castillo Bellido has requested that 
her nonimmigrant visa eligibility be restored as soon as possible to 
visit her mother who will shortly undergo brain surgery in Miami. 
Post has information that she resolved her property claims dispute 
with American citizen Ulises Carrillo on January 23, 2003.  Based on 
this evidence, Post requests that the Department determine whether 
Section 2225 of the 1998 Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring 
Act still applies to Mrs. Castillo Bellido.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On November 22, Marisol Maria Castillo Bellido, a 
high-ranking official of the National Electoral Commission who has 
ties to the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), contacted 
Embassy staff to request that her nonimmigrant visa (NIV) 
eligibility be restored as soon as possible to visit her mother who 
will shortly undergo brain surgery in Miami.  On April 12, 2002, 
Castillo Bellido and her husband, FSLN heavyweight Lenin Cerna, were 
deemed ineligible for an NIV under Section 2225 of the 1998 Foreign 
Relations Reform and Reconstruction Act.  Castillo Bellido and Cerna 
used their positions within the FSLN to personally benefit from 
property that was confiscated from U.S. citizen Ulises Carrillo in 
¶1979. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On December 6, 2002, Mr. Carrillo settled his property 
claim dispute with Castillo Bellido by accepting indemnification 
bonds issued by the Government of Nicaragua (GON) worth an estimated 
$120,766.00.  On January 23, 2003, the Embassy received a copy of 
the settlement document from the GON. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Action Request: Based on the information above, Post finds 
sufficient evidence that the property claim dispute between Marisol 
Maria Castillo Bellido and Ulises Carrillo has been resolved.  Thus, 
the Department may wish to consider removing her visa ineligibility 
under Section 2225.  If the Department concurs, we request that it 
promptly take the necessary steps to restore Ms. Castillo Bellido's 
eligibility to travel to the United States and to remove her name 
from the visa lookout system under this category.
