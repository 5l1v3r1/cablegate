Key Stories in the Media: 
------------------------- 
 
Israel Radio quoted the Quartet's Special Envoy, Tony Blair, as 
saying after his meeting with President Shimon Peres that: "I think 
there is a sense of possibility, but whether that sense of 
possibility can be translated into something, that is something that 
needs to be worked at and thought about over time." 
 
Leading media reported that Tony Blair met on Monday with Foreign 
Minister Tzipi Livni, Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Vice Prime 
Minster Haim Ramon. According to the media, the main topic of 
discussion was the regional conference planned for this fall. Blair 
was quoted as saying that the conference should have substance and 
not just be a photo opportunity. Following Blair's meeting with FM 
Livni, the latter said that she told him that he is coming at a 
critical moment and can help create a breakthrough. Blair is 
scheduled to meet Palestinian officials and Prime Minister Ehud 
Olmert on Tuesday. 
 
In response to Hizbullah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah's statement 
on Sunday that his organization is capable of hitting every part of 
Israel, Ha'aretz quoted a senior military source as saying that 
although Hizbullah managed to restore many capabilities, its 
missiles cannot reach every part of Israel. 
 
Yediot reported that Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayad used the 
600 million dollars that was unfrozen by Israel to pay salaries to 
all Palestinian state employees, including senior Hamas members. 
 
Ha'aretz cited security officials in the Palestinian Authority as 
saying that Hizbullah's influence on Fatah's Al Aqsa Martyrs' 
Brigades has been checked in recent months. 
 
Ha'aretz cited British Prime Minister Gordon Brown as saying in a 
press conference on Monday that he does not rule out military action 
against Iran. He also added that he believes that economic sanctions 
are the best way to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear 
aspirations. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that the IDF is launching a campaign 
asking Israelis who served in the IDF and live in the Diaspora to 
volunteer at West Bank checkpoints. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that the High Court of Justice ruled on 
Monday that the state must change the route of the security fence 
near Modiin Illit in order to cause less damage to Palestinian 
villagers. The decision will result in 20 more hectares being left 
on the Palestinian side. 
 
Leading media reported that for the second time in two months, US 
and Iranian representatives will meet in Iraq to discuss that 
country's internal situation. 
 
The media reported that a Qassam rocket hit a house in the Western 
Negev on Monday. No injuries were reported.

¶1. Tony Blairs' Mission: 
------------------------ 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn opined in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "From Israel's point of view, Blair's mission 
is a great opportunity. There are few with his standing, connections 
and experience in the world.... If anyone is going to mediate, it 
might as well be Blair and not someone who is less of a friend.  The 
possible alternatives, such as U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice or the European Union's Javier Solana, are not as promising." 
 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Shimon Shiffer wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv: "Israelis who have spoken with Blair got the 
impression that he intends to become the principal player in the 
international mediation effort in the region instead of Javier 
Solana and others.  His role model is former US President Bill 
Clinton.  We will probably see Blair muster all of his charm and 
unique rhetorical abilities to promote the resolution he envisions 
for this conflict." 
 
Commentator Anshel Pfeffer wrote in the independent, conservative 
Jerusalem Post: "What Rice didn't say, of course is that, no matter 
how close an ally Blair has been to the Bush administration, the 
real business of getting the two sides to talk to each other is 
still an American monopoly.... Right now, it doesn't seem as if 
those who are sending Blair have any real interest in his success."

¶I. "Bear-Hug Policy" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn opined in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (07/24): "In anticipation of Tony Blair's 
visit in his new role as Quartet envoy, the Prime Minister's Bureau 
has decided to adopt a 'bear-hug policy.'  From Israel's point of 
view, Blair's mission is a great opportunity. There are few with his 
standing, connections and experience in the world.... If anyone is 
going to mediate, it might as well be Blair and not someone who is 
less of a friend.  The possible alternatives, such as U.S. Secretary 
of State Condoleezza Rice or the European Union's Javier Solana, are 
not as promising.  Olmert will seek to use Blair's talents to 
disseminate the following message: that Israel wants an agreement 
with the Palestinians that it does not want to hold on to the 
territories, and that it is honestly interested in bolstering 
Palestinian Authority Chairman Mahmoud Abbas.  Blair can also serve 
as a useful conduit with the Saudis and others in the Arab world.... 
Blair's mission will officially begin during his next visit, in 
mid-September, at which point a regional summit will be held.  At 
that meeting, he will present Israel and the Palestinians his 
intentions and plans in greater detail.  Among the possible 
disagreements with Israel, Blair believes that the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at the root of enormous 
international problems, and he also believes it can be resolved.  He 
believes that the parties already know the solution and that all 
that is necessary is a good mediator.  In Israel, the view is that 
things are a lot more complex, but they are willing to listen." 
 
II. "Want to be Clinton" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Shimon Shiffer wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv (07/24): "Tony Blair arrived in Israel and the 
region in order to assess where it would be best to begin to the 
reconstruction work on the ruins of American-British policy.... For 
years Blair has believed that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is 
the source of all the woes and troubles of the Middle East and that 
resolving this conflict would radiate onto other conflicts and help 
stabilize the region.  Blair tried to persuade President Bush to 
accept that premise from the beginning of Bush's term in office. 
The problem was that Bush responded belatedly to Blair's entreaties 
to show real involvement and to seize the reins in leading the 
effort to reach a political arrangement.  One can assume that 
Blair's chances of success in the year and a half that Bush has left 
in the White House are not particularly high.... Israelis who have 
spoken with Blair got the impression that he intends to become the 
principal player in the international mediation effort in the region 
instead of Javier Solana and others.  His role model is former US 
President Bill Clinton.  We will probably see Blair muster all of 
his charm and unique rhetorical abilities to promote the resolution 
he envisions for this conflict. 
 
III. "The Believer" 
 
Commentator Anshel Pfeffer wrote in the independent, conservative 
Jerusalem Post (07/24): "You can accept what US Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice said about how there's enough work to go around and 
therefore Blair will be able to count himself lucky and probably 
pick up a Nobel Prize in the process if he succeeds in his narrow 
brief, developing the Palestinian economy and improving PA 
governance.  What Rice didn't say, of course is that, no matter how 
close an ally Blair has been to the Bush administration, the real 
business of getting the two sides to talk to each other is still an 
American monopoly.... Right now, it doesn't seem as if those who are 
sending Blair have any real interest in his success.  It's not only 
the smaller-than-hoped-for job description, or the lack of 
enthusiasm shown by some of the Quartet's members.  He has no fixed 
office yet and it's still unclear what size staff he will have to 
carry out his job.  And so far, he hasn't been promised a budget 
that he can use at his discretion to kick-start various programs. 
But according to everyone who has met him, Blair has inordinate 
faith in his personal powers of persuasion, and as incredible as it 
sounds, really believes that he can pull off something of the scale 
of the peace agreement his government brought about in Northern 
Ireland

¶2. Mideast: 
----------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz: "Olmert sees the road to his 
political resurrection as strengthening Fatah leaders in the West 
Bank.... Is he serious? Can he do it? Today, when there is no king 
of Israel, when every mistake in the book has been made, when the 
public is sick and tired of its leaders and pining for a political 
upheaval, is it possible that the next king of Israel will be Ehud 
Olmert -- this time with an agenda?"

"Olmert, King of Israel?" 
 
Senior columnist and longtime dove Yoel Marcus wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz (07/24): "Up until a few days 
ago, most political commentators said that Olmert was living on 
borrowed time and would soon be forced to resign.... But this 
Sunday, Olmert invited 150 Kadima wheelers and dealers to a powwow 
at his official residence.  There ... he declared that the news of 
his political death is premature.  Olmert is convinced that he will 
survive both the Lindenstrauss and Winograd reports.... Olmert's new 
strategic goal is to guard the Palestinians in the West Bank from a 
Hamas takeover.  Just a few months ago, Israel was saying Mahmoud 
Abbas was a weakling.  Now Israel is feeding him spinach and padding 
him with money, arms and good will gestures.... Israel, which has 
never been eager for an international conference, is now pleased as 
punch with the U.S. initiative.  Olmert sees the road to his 
political resurrection as strengthening Fatah leaders in the West 
Bank with money, arms, compromises and releasing prisoners. He wants 
Hamas supporters in Gaza to watch what is happening in Ramallah and 
its environs with a sinking heart, and see that there are other 
options.  Is he serious? Can he do it? Today, when there is no king 
of Israel, when every mistake in the book has been made, when the 
public is sick and tired of its leaders and pining for a political 
upheaval, is it possible that the next king of Israel will be Ehud 
Olmert -- this time with an agenda?"
