Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Al-Ayyam's front-page reports further on Secretary Clinton's July 15 
speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. The report notes that 
although Secretary Clinton called on Arab countries to take steps 
towards normalizing relations with Israel, she did not renew her 
calls on Israel to halt all settlement activities. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam cover a report in the Israeli daily 
Haaretz that the US administration intends to present a timeframe 
for the conclusion of negotiations between the Palestinians and 
Israelis.  The plan will reportedly be presented to Palestinian 
Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 
All dailies lead with statements made by Palestinian Authority 
President Mahmoud Abbas to the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation 
(PBC) in Sharm Al-Sheikh on July 16 in which he notes the only way 
to end internal Palestinian political conflict is to hold 
presidential and legislative elections under Arab and international 
supervision.  Regarding the Sixth Fatah Party Congress, due to begin 
August 4, Abbas reiterated that the conference will take place as 
scheduled. 
 
Al-Quds front-page includes a picture of Hamas Gaza leader Ismail 
Haniyeh with Anti-Zionist Jewish leaders from the US in Gaza.  The 
group arrived in Gaza July 16 with the "Life line II" aid convoy. 
Haniyeh is quoted as stating "we are not against the Jews but 
against the occupation." Haniyeh also added, "I hope President Obama 
adopts an approach that permanently ends the siege." 
 
Al-Quds front-page reports on an upcoming meeting between Fatah and 
Hamas representatives on July 18 in Cairo.  The purpose of the 
meeting is to prepare for the next session of reconciliation talks 
scheduled for July 25.  As part of its report, Al-Quds published in 
its entirety an Egyptian proposal to Fatah and Hamas on implementing 
a national consensus agreement. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page coverage of the continuing riots 
and protests by members of an ultra-orthodox Jewish sect, Toldot 
Aharon.  The paper notes the ongoing protest, which began several 
weeks ago in different areas of Jerusalem, started as a protest over 
a plan to open a parking lot during Shabbat.  It has since 
intensified when police and social services jailed an ultra-Orthodox 
pregnant woman arrested for allegedly starving her children. The 
protests have resulted in several arrests and injuries, and much 
damage. The paper reports the riots will continue over the 
weekend.-------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1) Atallah Mansour, Al-Quds, "Middle East Peace... Obama has two 
options" (07/17):  "In light of the current situation in the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, President Obama finds himself faced 
with two options: either give in to (Prime Minister Benjamin) 
Netanyahu and (Foreign Minister Avigdor) Lieberman's agenda, or 
quickly present a proposal that sets out his policy to end the 
conflict." 
 
2) Azmi Khawaja, Al-Ayyam, independent daily under the title "The 
national dialogue must succeed" (07/17): "The Palestinians have to 
o 
 
JERUSALEM 00001226  002 OF 002 
 
 
benefit from international support for the Palestinian cause, for 
the establishment of the independent Palestinian state, and for the 
cessation of settlements... The division can't continue and the 
dialogue must succeed."
