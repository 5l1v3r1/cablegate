  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  TAIWAN 
 
"Taiwan suspects U.S. arms sales tricks" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(11/02)(pg 3): "Hou 
Xiaohe, an associate professor at China's National Defense 
University, argued that in order to avoid angering the mainland over 
arms sales to Taiwan, the United States is likely to discourage 
Taiwan from buying U.S. arms by increasing its prices.  This will 
allow the U.S. to maintain room for maneuver and avoid violating the 
so-called 'Taiwan Relations Act.'  Several recent events have shown 
that the U.S. is exercising restraint on arms sales to Taiwan.  The 
U.S. Congress, which is firm about arms sales to Taiwan, has changed 
Item 1226 in the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act from 
'compulsory' to 'advisory.'  Without efforts on the part of the 
Obama administration, the U.S. Congress would not make such a 
change.  Of course, the U.S.'s restraint is also related to pressure 
from China." 
 
¶2.  U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
 
"'The big exchange': China is opening up its service sector and the 
U.S. is opening up its investment sector" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(11/02)(pg A15): "It is noticeable that 
while U.S.-China relations have on the surface entered a peaceful 
period, there are strong currents underneath.  This period is 
particularly sensitive since both countries are redefining their 
positions and testing each other's red lines.  The opening of the 
service sector [in China] could give U.S. companies a greater market 
share and provide more jobs for Americans.  Opening up investment in 
the U.S. could also help Chinese companies increase their foreign 
investment and transfer low-profit credit investment into 
high-profit stock investment.  The most interesting aspect of the 
'big exchange' is that the opening of China's service sector is not 
only what the U.S. wants but also what China's needs; and the 
opening of the U.Q's investment sector is what China wants and also 
what the U.S. needs." 
 
¶3.  EAST ASIAN COMMUNITY 
 
"The East Asian Community needs to go beyond economic issues" 
 
The Beijing-based newspaper sponsored by official intellectual 
publication Guangming Daily and Guangdong Provincial official 
publication Nanfang Daily The Beijing News (Xin Jing Bao)(11/02)(pg 
B02): "The starting point for the East Asian Community is economic 
cooperation, but the future focus will be security and political 
cooperation.  East Asian countries face the challenge of how to deal 
with the U.S., since the U.S. is trying to maintain its supremacy 
and prevent the appearance of any single superpower in the region. 
East Asian countries should find more common ground and effective 
mechanisms to solve problems, including land and religious disputes. 
 Only when geopolitical issues are solved, cQeconomic cooperation 
in the region develop further."
