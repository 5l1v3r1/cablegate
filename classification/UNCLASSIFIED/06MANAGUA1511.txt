¶1.  (U) On June 29, TDY Foreign Affairs Officer represented 
the Embassy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' induction 
ceremony for the successful candidates of the second public 
competitive examination for entrance to the nation's 
diplomatic service.  Of the ten candidates selected, nine 
were women.  The event was attended by representatives of the 
international diplomatic community, as well as officers of 
the Foreign Relations and other ministries. 
 
¶2.  (U) Minister of Foreign Affairs Norman Caldera delivered 
the opening address, commenting that the open, merit-based 
competitive examination process signals a professionalization 
of the nation's diplomatic corps that will enable Nicaragua 
to more adequately face the demands of an increasingly 
competitive and globalized world.  He noted that the testing 
process was rigorous -- including examinations in Nicaraguan 
and world history, international relations, international 
law, economics, world culture and English for foreign 
professional communication.  Exam scoring was conducted 
anonymously and candidates underwent  rigorous oral exams 
before members of a statutorily created commission. The test 
results were made public.  The Minister thanked Ave Maria 
College for its cooperation in the exam preparation process. 
 
¶3.  (U) Caldera highlighted that the fact that nine female 
candidates were selected demonstrates the powerful presence 
of women as leaders in contemporary Nicaragua, adding that 
Nicaragua's ambassadors in Peru, Egypt, Belize and France are 
female.  His remarks were followed by a speech by Vice 
Minister of Foreign Relations Javier Williams Slate (a member 
of the Miskito indigenous community), who presided over the 
induction of the individual candidates.  The Vice Minister 
focused on the youth of the 10 selected candidates, referring 
to them as "distinguished and dedicated citizens" who 
represent the future of the nation's Foreign Service.
