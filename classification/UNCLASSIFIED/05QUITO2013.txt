SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION:  PAT ROBERTSON'S STATEMENT 
 
"Thou Shall Not Kill," an editorial (08/25) in 
Quito's populist "La Hora" (circ. 120,000) 
 
Quote:  "The unusual request made by the US 
evangelist preacher Pat Roberson demonstrates 
incredible arrogance and disrespect for human life. 
Not since the times of the Monroe Doctrine and 
McCarthyism have we seen this kind of attitude 
towards a Latin American leader. . . 
 
"One can either agree or disagree with the ideology 
or actions of a chief of state, but to call for his 
assassination via the mass media is a criminal 
terrorist act, to which judicial authorities in the 
US should react . . ."
