¶1. (SBU)  Via diplomatic note, the BRV thanked the FAA for 
elevating Venezuela to Category 1 and mentioned the "good 
disposition" of the FAA team that visited on March 27-30. 
The BRV also communicated the desire to expand its airlines' 
services to more U.S. destinations, and seek "equilibrium of 
aero-commercial relations" within the stipulations of the 
current bilateral agreement.  The National Institute for 
Civil Aviation (INAC) had hinted at this many times during 
the Category 1 discussions.  The BRV has announced that they 
will begin route requests in 3-5 months, and will likely 
press this issue only when airlines are ready to invest in 
additional routes and schedules. 
 
¶2. (U) Post received a diplomatic note from the BRV MFA dated 
May 20, 2005 on avation matters. 
 
Unofficial translation of diplomatic note: 
 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela 
Ministry of Foreign Relations 
Office of the Minister 
 
No. 002657 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Relations of the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela, Office of the Minister, presents its 
compliments to the Honorable Embassy of the United States of 
America, and has the honor to inform that the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela is pleased to know that the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA, given its initials in English) 
has decided to modify its opinion with respect to Venezuelan 
air safety.  In this respect, it is worthy of mentioning that 
our country complies and will continue to comply faithfully 
and strictly with the Recommended Norms and Methods (SARPS) 
of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as 
stated in the operational safety audit carried out by said 
organization between June and July of 2004. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Relations of the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela, Office of the Minister, wishes to make a record 
of the good disposition of the representatives of the Federal 
Aviation Administration during the technical visit that took 
place from the 27th to the 30th of March of 2006, which 
reaffirms that the mechanisms of dialogue and effective 
coordination allow us to find points of understanding and 
effective solutions to the bilateral problem in a cordial 
atmosphere. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Relations of the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela, Office of the Minister, reiterates that the 
decision taken will allow the expansion of commercial 
possibilities of this country's companies to participate in 
offering flights to the principal destinations in the United 
States of America, with the goal of recovering the 
equilibrium of aero-commercial relations between both 
countries, to develop under principles of equality of 
opportunity, reciprocity, and equity, in accordance with what 
is stipulated in the current Bilateral Agreement. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Relations of the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela, Office of the Minister, while manifesting its 
confidence that in a brief time lapse Venezuelan airlines 
will be able to begin operations in that country, takes the 
opportunity to reiterate to the Honorable Embassy of the 
United States of America, the assurances of its highest 
consideration and esteem.
