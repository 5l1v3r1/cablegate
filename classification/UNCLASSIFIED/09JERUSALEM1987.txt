SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (11/4): Palestinians not convinced 
of US position on settlements 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds leads with news on the Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President's office spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeina saying that 
Secretary Clinton's clarification of her earlier remarks on 
settlements are not enough for the PA to pursue negotiations with 
Israel. Abu Rundeina called on the US to force Israel to stop all 
settlement activity in the Palestinian territories (including 
natural growth), particularly in Jerusalem. 
 
Al-Quds also front pages news on Secretary Clinton's interview with 
Al-Hurra TV yesterday in which she "claimed that the Arab foreign 
ministers understood what she meant regarding the US position on 
settlements," according to coverage. Al-Ayyam quotes a senior US 
official in Morocco noting to the press that Clinton wasn't mistaken 
in the statements she made in Israel regarding settlements. 
 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam report on the PA Minister of Public Works 
Muhammad Shtayyeh stating yesterday that President Abbas refused to 
take three phone calls from Special Envoy George Mitchell last week. 
Shtayyeh noted that Abbas will not give in to any external pressure 
to change his position regarding settlements and reaffirmed that the 
PA will not resume negotiations with Israel prior to the full 
cessation of settlement activity. 
 
The three dailies front page news that the United Nations General 
Assembly will convene today to discuss the Goldstone report and vote 
on sending it to the UN Security Council. The reports note that 
Israel has urged the international community to reject the report. 
 
Settlers' attempt to take control of a house that belongs to a 
Palestinian family in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of East 
Jerusalem also receives front page coverage in all the dailies. The 
family held off the settlers, but the Israeli police gave the family 
10 days to take up the matter with the court. Reports also note that 
the Israeli authorities will demolish 35 Palestinians houses in East 
Jerusalem in the coming months due to the lack of appropriate 
building permits.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title "Is 
Washington For the Settlement Freeze or Against It?" (11/04): 
"During the past three days, we've heard contradictory statements 
from Secretary Clinton on the US position on settlements. This 
contradiction raises questions about the credibility of the US. In 
the worst case, it proves that the administration hasn't succeeded 
in changing the impressions that everyone held during the Bush 
administration that the US is completely biased toward Israel." 
 
2) Hafeth Barghouti opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily 
under the title "The Map is American Made" (11/04): "We did not 
design the road map, the Americans did. Its first phase includes the 
full cessation of settlement activity, including natural growth ... 
However, it seems as if Secretary Clinton has not read the road map 
yet. If she had read it, she would have taken another stance 
regarding settlements and negotiations."
