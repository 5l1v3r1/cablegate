¶1.  In a May 7 communique issued by the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA), the Government of Algeria expressed its 
"satisfaction" with the conclusion of a peace agreement to 
resolve the Darfur crisis.  Algeria "rejoices in this 
positive development" and wishes that the "parties who are 
not yet signatories will agree to it as soon as possible to 
allow the agreement to realize its full potential." 
 
¶2.  Algeria, the communique continued, saluted the African 
Union heads of state who "promoted this peaceful solution to 
a conflict of utmost concern to the international community." 
 Algeria also rendered homage "to the partners of Africa for 
their positive role...in rallying all the actors in the 
conflict around this agreement and the peaceful dynamic which 
is expected from it."  The communique concluded by expressing 
Algeria's hope that "this peace agreement will begin an era 
of stability and prosperity for the Republic of Sudan as well 
as for the African continent in its entirety." 
 
¶3.  At a May 7 state lunch for the visiting leader of 
Mauritania, President Bouteflika added:  "It is with immense 
joy" that we learned of the agreement.  "We are equally 
calling on the international community...to support the 
efforts of the parties in conflict to reach a definitive 
settlement of the Darfur crisis in close collaboration with 
the African Union."
