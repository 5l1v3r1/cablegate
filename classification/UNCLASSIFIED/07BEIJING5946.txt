DPRK: Nuclear Experts Arrive, PRC Ambassador Leaves 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. At the September 11 regular MFA press briefing, 
spokeswoman Jiang Yu confirmed that Russian and Chinese teams 
of nuclear experts arrived in the DPRK on September 11 to 
discuss the specifics of the disablement of nuclear 
facilities.  She said in response to an inquiry regarding the 
return to China of PRC Ambassador to the DPRK Liu Xiaoming 
that the return was a "normal" one for annual leave, but 
added that she would check on the details. 
 
No Date Set for Six-Party Talks 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. When asked for details about the upcoming Six-Party Talks, 
Jiang replied that, while China is working with other 
countries to prepare for the event, no date has been set at 
this time. 
 
Olympic Security 
---------------- 
 
¶4. In response to a request for information on any specific 
group that the Chinese government fears as a terrorist threat 
to the Olympics, Jiang stated that the Chinese government is 
sparing no effort for Olympic security and has the resolve 
and capability to hold a successful Olympics.  When further 
pressed for information regarding specific instances of 
international cooperation regarding Olympic security, Jiang 
redirected the reporter to the "relevant authorities," but 
stressed that China is working with the international 
community and does not link terrorism to any specific nation 
or religion. 
 
China a Victim of Cyber Attacks, Stands Ready to Help 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶5. Asked for comments on a French report detailing 
cyber-attacks by and on Chinese citizens, Jiang said that 
Chinese were frequently the victims of cyber-attacks, China 
has strict laws against "hacking" and the Chinese government 
stands ready to work with other countries to combat 
cyber-crime.  She added that she had checked with "relevant 
authorities" the week before and they did not report 
receiving any requests from other countries to cooperate in 
investigations. China wants to strengthen channels for 
cooperation in this regard, Jiang said. 
 
Dalai Lama Congressional Gold Medal Visit 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Responding to a request for comment on the Dalai Lama's 
planned trip to the United States to receive the 
Congressional Gold Medal, Jiang emphasized that Tibet is a 
part of the Chinese territory.  She said that the Dalai Lama 
is not merely a religious figure, but a political force 
involved in efforts to split the motherland.  China hopes 
that other countries recognize these "splittist" activities. 
 
Pakistani Deportation of Sharif is Internal Affair 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶7. Asked about the Chinese assessment of Pakistan's recent 
deportation of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Jiang 
 
BEIJING 00005946  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
responded that such matters are the internal affairs of 
Pakistan and that Pakistanis themselves will best maintain 
the stability and development of their nation. 
 
China Working with Russia on Missing Tourists 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. Jiang stated that the Chinese government is extremely 
concerned about the fate of six Russian tourists missing in 
the northwest province of Xinjiang for eight days.  China has 
mobilized search and rescue activities and all efforts are 
being made to find them.  Jiang added that China would be 
cooperating with a team of Russian search experts that 
arrived in China on September 11, but ignored a reporter's 
suggestion that the tourists could have been kidnapped. 
 
PRC Censoring Meteorologists? 
----------------------------- 
 
¶9. Jiang refused to comment on reports that the Chinese 
government is actively restricting or censoring the reports 
and information of meteorologists in an effort to cover up 
poor air quality.  Jiang instead referred journalists to the 
Meteorological Bureau. 
 
Upcoming Visit of Serbian Foreign Minister 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶10. Jiang announced that Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic 
will visit China September 12-14 at the invitation of FM Yang 
Jiechi.
