SUBJECT: CONGRATULATORY LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA FROM THE 
ISLAMIC EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION 
(ISESCO) 
 
¶1.  Summary and introduction:  The Islamic Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) Director 
General, Dr. Abdulaziz Othman Altwaijri, has sent a letter of 
congratulations to President Obama.  The January 23, 2009 
letter praised President Obama's commitment to engage the 
Islamic World with mutual interest and respect.  In response, 
ISESCO offers to work to translate this concept into 
"concrete action."  ISESCO, headquartered in Rabat, is a 
quasi-independent sub-entity of the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference (OIC).  ISESCO has a role in promoting 
education and culture similar to UNESCO, with a mandate to 
assist curriculum development and educational programs 
throughout the Islamic world, and may merit USG engagement. 
The original of the letter has been scanned and sent to 
Department (NEA/MAG).  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  BEGIN TEXT (Original in English): 
 
Allow me Mr. President to sincerely congratulate you on your 
investiture as President of the United States of America, 
which shoulders a great responsibility for keeping world 
peace and security, preserving democratic values and public 
liberties, and administrating justice, in accordance with 
international legality. 
 
By virtue of your distinguished record, your ambition, your 
probity and your eagerness for constructive change, you have 
not only fulfilled a dream cherished by millions of American 
citizens but also earned the admiration and respect of 
millions of people around the world. 
 
We at the Islamic Education, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (ISESCO), which includes fifty States of the 
Islamic world and has fruitful cooperation relationships with 
tens of international and regional organizations, greet your 
investiture with great optimism and wish you every success in 
your lofty missions in addressing acute problems and tough 
challenges that befall today,s world.  These include wars, 
aggression on peoples, rights and dignity, economic 
recession, poverty and other scourges that require concerted 
and continuous global action to find a remedy thereto. 
 
Mr. President, in your inaugural speech, you have pointed out 
your willingness to &seek new way forward8 with the Islamic 
world, &based on mutual interest and mutual respect8.  We 
wholeheartedly subscribe to this highly commendable gesture 
and will contribute all our potentials and expertise to set 
it into motion. 
 
Therefore, I hereby confirm to Your Excellency that ISESCO, 
within its competence and through its network of special 
relations with its Member States as well as with 
international and regional organizations, is keen to pursue 
its efforts to translate this constructive move into concrete 
action. 
 
Please accept, Mr. President, the assurance of my highest 
consideration.
