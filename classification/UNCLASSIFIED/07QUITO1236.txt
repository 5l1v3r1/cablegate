APPENDIX II 
 
REF: STATE 51890 
 
¶1.  Post delivered reftel points to Frida Pin Hoppe in the 
Ministry of Environment on April 24; post later received the 
following written responses from the appropriate scientific 
authorities via her office. They are reproduced verbatim due 
to their technical nature. 
 
¶2.  What is the conservation status of Cedrela and Dalbergia 
species (if applicable) in the country?:  In order to 
determine the status of the species Swietenia macrophylla and 
Cedrela odorata, the Ministry of Environment established a 
prohibition on the harvest of these two species by means of 
Ministerial Accord No. 167 of January 11, 2007, published in 
Official Registry No. 18 of February 8, 2007.  The Ministry 
has plans for an inventory project that would include 
international cooperation in order to raise funds. 
 
¶3.  What are the impacts of harvest and international trade 
on its wild populations?:  Ecuador is focusing on sustainable 
logging, with a forestry standard based on the  Basic 
Principles of Sustainable Forest Management, that includes: 
sustainability of production; maintenance of tree canopy; 
biodiversity conservation; management co-responsibility; 
reduction of negative environmental and social impacts. 
 
¶4.  What are the volumes exported from Ecuador and what parts 
and/or products of the species are exported?:  This 
information does not exist since national totals are not 
disaggregated by species. 
 
¶5.  Does Ecuador support or oppose the proposals to list the 
species in Appendix II, and does Ecuador prefer to annotate 
the proposals to limit the listing?:  The inclusion of a 
species in Appendix II assumes a series of commitments on the 
part of countries in the species' distribution area; these 
commitments require the allocation of funds; funds that 
countries like Ecuador, which prioritizes investment in 
social causes, do not have.  It would have been important for 
Germany to include some of the distribution area countries in 
the drafting of its Proposal No. 33; information in the 
document should be more extensive.  Ecuador does not support 
including the Cedrela genus in Appendix II, however we will 
evaluate its inclusion in Appendix III.  In the case of the 
Dalbergia genus (which does not exist in Ecuador), we support 
the position of countries within its area of distribution.
