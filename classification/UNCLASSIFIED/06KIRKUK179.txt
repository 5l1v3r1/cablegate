¶1. (U) On December 19, a group of about 100-150 demonstrators 
from the Turcoman People's Women Union assembled in front of the 
REO to express discontent with provisions of the Iraq Study 
Group (ISG) report.  The Women Union is an affiliate of the 
Turcoman Brotherhood Party (led by Walid Sharika, a member of 
the National Council of Representaives Article 140 Committee), 
itself a member of the Kurdistan Coalition List.  The 
demonstration was scripted along the lines of last week's 
demonstration (reftel), and representatives from the group 
invited into the REO presented similar complaints ("rejection" 
of paras. 26, 27, 28 and 31 of the ISG report relating to the 
constitution, allocation of regional resources, Kirkuk final 
status, and reconciliation with Baathists). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The demonstrators' representatives spoke at length on 
the perils of dialog with Baathists.  Answering REO Regional 
Director's query about whether these views also indicated a 
rejection of Prime Minister Maliki's recent speech on allowing 
former Baath members into the Army, the Turcoman said they 
"fully supported" Maliki's efforts at reconciliation.  To them, 
the key difference between Maliki's actions and their reading of 
the ISG reconciliation recomendations was that Maliki drew the 
line in accepting dialog with people with "blood on their 
hands." 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: Since last week's high level demarche to the 
REO by the Provincial Council (reftel), it seems Kurdistan 
Coalition List members and affiliates of all stripes have been 
tripping over each other to publicly propagate the same anti-ISG 
message, using cut-and-pasted talking points.  There have been 
manifestos sent to us by a Kurdish-affiliated journalist 
syndicate, a student union and coming up in the next week: a 
group being organized from here to demonstrate in 
al-Sulaymaniyah.  In all cases we have reminded that the ISG 
report is not U.S. policy.  END COMMENT.
