AMAZON CONSERVATION INITIATIVE (ICAA) 
 
REF: 2008 BRASILIA 770 
 
BRASILIA 00000559  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  The South America Regional Environmental HUB Office attended the 
Third Annual Meeting of the Andean Amazon Conservation Initiative 
(ICAA) in Bogota, Colombia, April 19-25.  These annual conferences 
bring together more than twenty partner organizations of this 
USAID-funded initiative to exchange experiences and lessons learned. 
 (REFTEL)  This conference gathered together over 80 people from 
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, as well as other international 
experts. 
 
¶2.  Consortium members stated that the initiative has been 
successful so far and are optimistic about the future of this 
regional program.  This year's meeting focused on the impacts of the 
financial crisis on conservation projects; the threat of 
infrastructure development to isolated indigenous populations and 
protected areas; the effects of climate change on Andean countries; 
impact of informal mining on water resources; and the protection of 
Indigenous intellectual property. 
 
¶3.  The purpose of this exchange is to increase regional 
collaboration to support the efforts of the indigenous populations 
and local communities in conserving biodiversity, using sustainably 
their natural resources, and valuing environmental services in the 
Andean Amazon.  Especially important were the working sessions on 
indigenous issues, financial strategies for conservation, policy, 
and capacity-building. 
 
¶4.  The move of the HUB from Brasilia to Lima this summer was 
welcomed by environmental organizations such as Wildlife 
Conservation Society (WCS) and the Peruvian Society for 
Environmental Law (SPDA).
