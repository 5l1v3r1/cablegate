With photos of Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmud Abbas and 
Jordanian King Abdullah II, the three dailies lead with front page 
reports on the two leaders' meeting in Jordan on September 7. 
According to a statement made by Jordanian royal protocol, Abbas and 
Abdullah II discussed efforts being made to push forward 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.  King Abdullah confirmed Jordan's 
support to the PA's efforts to solve all final status issues, 
reporting notes.  Following their meeting, Abbas told press that he 
will meet with Arab foreign ministers on September 8 in Cairo to 
discuss latest negotiations with Israel. 
All front pages highlight news that Israel's police have recommended 
that Israeli Premier Olmert be indicted on a series of corruption 
charges. 
All dailies front-page a Wafa report that Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Premier Fayyad noted that the European Parliament has discussed 
Palestinian prisoner issues for the first time, according to a 
statement made by Fayyad during a September 7 Ramallah area iftar 
held in honor of released Palestinian prisoners. Fayyad confirmed 
that the prisoners' cause will not be resolved until all prisoners 
are released without restrictions or pre-conditions.  In related 
coverage citing DPA and Ma'an news agencies, the three dailies 
report that Hamas denied reports that Egypt's mediation role 
regarding Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit has changed.  Hamas spokesman 
Ismail Radwan confirmed that, "reports on moving Shalit's case from 
Egypt to other Arab parties are inaccurate and untrue," adding, 
"Egypt is still mediating the prisoners' exchange deal with Israel." 
 
Al-Suds' front page highlights that Israel's government on September 
6 postponed discussion on legislation that would pay Jewish settlers 
to leave their homes in the West Bank, as part of a future peace 
agreement with the Palestinians.  The paper cites news agencies and 
Israeli army radio. 
 
The Gaza-Egypt Rafah crossing point will be open for two additional 
days this week, according to Al Qud's front page.  Official 
Palestinian sources explain that the opening will alleviate, "the 
hardship of the sick, citizens, and students in the Gaza Strip."

Sunday, September 7, 2008 
Large photos of Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas and 
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak introduced front page reporting in 
all three dailies about the September 6 meeting of the two 
presidents in Cairo.  During their meeting, Abbas reportedly told 
Mubarak that chances of reaching peace with Israel by the end of 
2008 look slim.  Abbas was quoted as saying, "Jerusalem and the 
right of return are inalienable Palestinian rights."  Regarding 
Egyptian mediation efforts to heal the inter-Palestinian rift, Abbas 
expressed appreciation for Egypt's supportive stance, saying that 
Egypt's continued efforts towards the resumption of an 
inter-Palestinian reconciliation dialogue will soon bear fruit. 
The front pages cited news agency reports about the September 6 
meeting between Palestinian Authority lead negotiator Ahmad Quray 
and former U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross.  Quray briefed Ross on 
latest developments in the Palestinian Territories, highlighting the 
issues of increasing Israeli military "invasions" into the West Bank 
and random arrests, and the construction of settlements and "facts 
on the ground" in Jerusalem that serve to, "wrest the city from the 
 
JERUSALEM 00001658  002 OF 003 
 
 
hands of Palestinians."  Quray affirmed to press after the meeting 
that the way to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region 
is clear:  Through an end to the occupation, a halt in settlement 
building and the construction of the separation wall, and 
recognition of a Palestinian stake in Jerusalem. He added that peace 
can be quickly realized and that Palestinian leadership is 
"clinging" to President Bush's vision of a two state solution. 
Finally, Quray reaffirmed the commitment of the Palestinian 
leadership to the Arab peace initiative and related international 
resolutions. 
Citing DPA, all dailies' front pages reported that Deputy Chief of 
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine Mr. Abdul Rahim 
Maluh said, in an interview with the London-based newspaper, 
Al-Hayat Al-Londoniyya, published on September 6, that the only exit 
from the current Palestinian crisis is fixing a date for holding 
early Palestinian presidential and parliamentarian elections. 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida highlighted on their front pages a 
new poll conducted by Near East Consulting conducted between August 
29 and 31.  According to the poll, 72% of Palestinian respondents do 
not expect reunification between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip 
before the end of 2008; 79% support the formation of a national 
unity government to help solve the internal Palestinian crisis; 56% 
support the involvement of Arab security forces in the Gaza Strip; 
70% are against confederation with Jordan; 78% trust Palestinian 
Authority President Mahmud Abbas; 41% support Fatah; 70% support 
signing a peace agreement with Israel; 58% want Hamas to change its 
stance regarding the elimination of Israel; 86% suffer from 
frustration.

Citing Wafa, the three dailies led with front page news on about 
Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas' speech at the 
Ambrosetti Forum in Italy on September 5.  President Abbas said that 
the siege and sanctions imposed on Gaza will cause a human disaster. 
 In related coverage on front pages, the three dailies cited a 
Reuters' report about Abbas' doubts about the possibility of 
reaching a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel by the end of 
this year. 
 
With large photos on their front pages, the three dailies reported 
that tens of thousands of worshipers performed the first Friday 
prayer during the holy month of Ramadan on September 5 at Al-Aqsa 
Mosque in Jerusalem.  According to reports, Israeli authorities 
imposed strict procedures and prevented West Bankers under the age 
of 45 from reaching Jerusalem to perform the Friday prayers at 
Al-Aqsa Mosque. 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida cited news agency reports about the 
historic visit of US Secretary of State Rice to Libya on September 5 
and her meeting with its leader Muammar Qadhafi.  According to 
coverage, the White House said Rice's visit marked a "new chapter" 
and that cooperation could expand in the areas of education and 
culture, commerce, science and technology, security and human 
rights.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Independent Al-Quds editorialized in "We are not in Need of More 
Division," (9/8): "Once again, division in the Palestinian arena has 
resurfaced in the expression of political positions related to the 
teachers' strike in the Gaza Strip.  This is, of course, not a 
political issue because the teachers' demands are clear and not 
related to the political conflict in the Palestinian arena... 
 
JERUSALEM 00001658  003 OF 003 
 
 
political powers including, Fatah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the 
Presidency, Dr. Fayyad Government and the former government of the 
Gaza Strip, should be reminded that it is everyone's duty to work on 
solving the teachers' problems and to work on ending internal 
division..." 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam runs an editorial by daily columnist Samih 
Shbayb entitled, "The Internal Conflict Crisis" (9/08):  "Efforts 
made in Cairo to heal inter-Palestinian division seem absurd.  They 
are incapable of identifying the correct party that is hindering the 
process and the role of that party in continuing its control of the 
Gaza Strip through military force.  The suggested solutions seem 
ridiculous and impossible to implement...which way will 
Palestinian-Palestinian dialogue turn after Ramadan, and will things 
be left [hanging] because of an open agenda, awaiting the future 
international and regional developments?!"
