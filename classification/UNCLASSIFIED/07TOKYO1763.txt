REF: SECSTATE 39551 
 
¶1. On April 17, ESToff spoke with MOFA Principal Deputy 
Director, Non-Proliferation, Science and Nuclear Energy 
Division Kaoru Magosaki, concerning Russian participation in 
ASTOP. Magosaki informed ESToff that Russian Minister 
Counsellor Galizin visited MOFA on March 7 to appeal to the 
Japanese government on behalf of Russia. However, GOJ is 
lukewarm to the prospect. Magosaki believes that Russia may 
not be a constructive partner. He cited three main reasons. 
 
a. Displeased with performance at multilateral forums: At a 
recent PSI meeting in Montreal, Russia objected to discussing 
Res. 1718, which is an important issue to Japan.  Magosaki 
said that Japan cannot welcome a country into ASTOP, which 
refuses to address critical issues affecting Japan's 
political and social landscape. 
 
 
b. Official reports of ASTOP meetings are distributed: Japan 
is willing to share reports of ASTOP meetings with Russian 
counterparts. Therefore there is no need for Russia to 
attend. ASTOP is a framework to enhance dialogue, not a 
decision-making body. (NOTE:  In the past, MOFA did not issue 
an official report of the meetings. However, last year, due 
to China's urging, a report was drafted.  With interest in 
these meetings increasing, it is likely that a formal report 
will be made available to all interested parties.) 
 
c. Non-Asian countries may overshadow ASTOP's objectives: 
Magosaki stated that although Canada and New Zealand were 
invited to participate in ASTOP in 2007, it is too early to 
consider further expansion because discussion could be 
diluted if too many non-Asian countries attend. 
 
 
¶2. Although Russia has a long-history of nuclear experience, 
intelligence and analysis capabilities, MOFA stated that it 
is premature to consider inviting Russia as a partner. 
However, if Russia changes its posture on Res. 1718 in 
multilateral forums, then Japan may be willing to consider 
bringing Russia into ASTOP. Magosaki concluded the 
conversation by stating that Japan looks forward to a 
response from Washington on its views.
