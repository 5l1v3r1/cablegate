SUBJECT: PUBLIC AND OFFICIAL REACTION TO AMMAN BOMBINGS IS 
SWIFT AND FIRM 
 
¶1.  Public and official reactions to the November 9 hotel 
bombings in Amman were uniformly expressions of the 
un-islamic nature of the attacks, and disgust for the 
perpetrators.  According to Embassy local employees, some 150 
people -- including men and women of several nationalities -- 
gathered in front of the Jordanian Embassy in the afternoon 
of November 10, carrying images of King Abdullah II, and 
handing out leaflets strongly condemning the attacks as 
un-islamic and demanding simply "stop terrorism." 
 
¶2.  Also on November 10, the ROYG's official news agency 
quoted a Foreign Ministry official who strongly condemned the 
attacks and expressed solidarity with the government and 
people of Jordan. 
 
¶3.  COMMENT:  It is not common to see such public displays of 
grief and anger over foreign terrorist acts in Yemen, but the 
recent visit of the Jordanian monarch, and the presence of a 
sizeable Jordanian community in Yemen may have caused these 
particular attacks to strike closer to home for some Yemenis.
