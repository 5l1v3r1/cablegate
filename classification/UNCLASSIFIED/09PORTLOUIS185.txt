In a June 18 follow-up conversation with POLOFF, Martine Kim 
Young-Fat, First Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed 
that GOM would indeed vote in favor of a newly EU proposed 
'Independent Expert' in lieu of a mandate renewal for the Special 
Rapporteur for the human rights situation in Sudan.  Thanking USG 
for the previously demarched points, Ms. Young-Fat explained that in 
sensitive situations like Sudan where there are "ever-changing 
developments" it was typical for her Ministry to hold off until the 
last moment to give voting directions to GOM Mission Geneva.
