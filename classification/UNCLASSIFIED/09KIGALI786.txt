SUBJECT: KITCHEN GARDENS INCREASE FOOD SECURITY OF 
CONGOLESE REFUGEES 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: American Refugee Committee (ARC) has 
implemented a project to improve food production by and for 
vulnerable families in the Kiziba refugee camp in western 
Rwanda, using grant funds from the Bureau of Population, 
Refugees and Migration's 2009 Julia Taft Fund for Refugees. 
On November 17, Emboffs visited the camp to view the project, 
which appears set to achieve good results. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) ARC received a grant of approximately $4,500 from 
PRM's 2009 Julia Taft Fund for Refugees, formerly "The 
Ambassador's Fund," to improve food production in the Kiziba 
refugee camp in western Rwanda. (Note: The Fund is meant to 
cover a one-time, low-cost gap in refugee protection and 
assistance and not a long-term program. End Note.) Emboffs 
visited the camp November 17 to view the project. Kiziba camp 
is well-established, with approximately 18,000 Congolese 
refugees, many of whom have been in the camp for over ten 
years. Lack of space and available land limit the 
possibilities for large-scale agriculture and animal rearing. 
Although ARC does not implement the health services in Kiziba 
camp, a recent survey showed high rates of malnutrition and 
stunting, prompting it to apply for a grant through the Taft 
Fund. 
 
¶3. (U) The objectives of the project were to increase food 
production through kitchen gardens and small animal rearing, 
reduce negative coping mechanisms such as vandalism and 
selling of food rations, and increase the self-esteem of 
vulnerable refugees. The grant provided initial agricultural 
and animal rearing inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, tools, 
and baby chickens and rabbits. Additionally, ARC used grant 
money to construct poultry and rabbit houses and construct 
wire fences around kitchen gardens. ARC organized the 
beneficiaries into small income generating groups and divided 
available land into smaller plots for each group. (Note: 
Groups planted kitchen gardens on land that was formerly used 
for latrines after agricultural specialists deemed it safe. 
End Note.) Each garden group has one representative in the 
small animal rearing cooperative. 
 
¶4. (U) The project provides direct benefits to 327 refugees, 
and indirect benefits to an additional 1,308 family members. 
Each group is responsible for the care, maintenance, and 
security of the gardens and animal houses. Groups plan to 
consume some of the crops and animal products and sell any 
surplus to other refugees in the camp or the surrounding 
local population. Because ARC has just finished implementing 
the project, it is not yet possible to gauge its impact on 
nutrition or increased food production; however, the gardens 
and animal houses appeared well-constructed and productive. 
One beneficiary already eats and sells eggs from the animal 
rearing project, improving both her and her family's 
nutritional status and increasing her income. 
 
¶5. (U) COMMENT: As in Rwanda's other two refugee camps, 
refugees in Kiziba expressed a desire to return to eastern 
Congo, but not until there is peace and security. Projects 
like this provide immediate benefits such as increased income 
and improved nutrition, and also provide refugees with skills 
they will be able to use once they return to Congo. 
Additionally, employing men and women in productive work 
helps address the problem of domestic violence, which is 
exacerbated by men lacking meaningful employment. END 
COMMENT.
