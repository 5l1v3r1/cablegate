¶1.  MFA Disarmament and Arms Control First Secretary Serhan 
Yigit provided us with a list of the 57 countries which were 
invitd to participate in the May 2006 Turkish-led PS 
exercise "Anatolian Deer,"annotated with their responses to 
date.  17 have responded that they will attend the exercise, 
3 have responded negatively and the GOT is still awaiting a 
response from 37 invited countries.  Yigit noted that a 
positive response did not necessarily mean that the country 
would participate fully, but that it might only send an 
observer. 
 
¶2.  Countries listed as participating in the exercise were: 
Albania, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, 
Georgia, Germany, Iraq, Latvia, Malta, Moldova, Poland, 
Portugal, United Kingdom, Ukraine and the United States. 
(Note: The United States is listed as responding and 
participating, although a formal answer to the Turkish 
invitation is still pending, -- ref a.)  France and Portugal 
are the only countries that have committed to providing 
assets to participate in the exercise so far. 
 
¶3.  Countries listed as not participating in the exercise 
were Belarus, Hungary, Turkmenistan.  Yigit noted that 
Turkmenistan claimed a lack funding as the reason for not 
being able to attend; Hungary noted prior commitments that 
will not allow them to commit to the exercise at this time, 
but held out the prospect that that might change; Belarus did 
not provide a reason for their non-participation. 
 
¶4.  Comment: We will continue to monitor the development of 
the Anatolian Deer exercise.  GOT officials are doing their 
best to try to finalize the participation of additional 
countries in order to allow the exercise developers from the 
Turkish General Staff sufficient time to construct an 
exercise that allows full participation from all countries 
that desire to participate while also testing the overall 
operation and execution of the Proliferation Security 
Initiative.
