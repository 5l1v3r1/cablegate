IN TODAY'S PAPERS 
 
Village Guard System Under Scrutiny After Brutal Attack in Mardin 
All papers:   The Killing of 44 people at a wedding ceremony in 
Mardin's Bilge Village remains the top issue for today's media 
outlets.  Eight people were arrested yesterday in connection with 
the attack.  Papers report that 70 children were orphaned from the 
attack.  Mainstream Sabah and all TV channels last night reported 
that the relatives of the suspects of the massacre, despite the 
security measures taken by the gendarmerie, were leaving their 
village for good.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak quoted Interior 
Minister Besir Atalay as saying "the weapons used in the massacre 
were the weapons given by the state to the village guards."  Liberal 
Radikal notes that the village guard system in the Southeast became 
the focus of attention in the aftermath of the massacre in Bilge 
village and the government plans to reform the system after 
discussions with regional officials, civilian organizations and 
security officials.  Mainstream Sabah reports that the DTP has filed 
a proposal to initiate a parliamentary investigation into the 
village guard system. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Mardin Bloodbath 
 
Hadi Uluengin wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "This unspeakable act, 
among other things, also demonstrates a fact that has been ignored - 
blood feuds and other archaic traditions are part of the Kurdish 
culture and this is something that needs to be addressed 
seriously." 
 
Ahmet Selim wrote in Islamist oriented Zaman: "This deliberately 
planned massacre is a reflection of social trauma in the society - 
it's not mental illness, it's a thinking illness.  And this 
psychology is not limited only to rural Turkey, but now there are 
fewer legal ways to punish such a crime.  It was a mistake to 
abolish capital punishment." 
 
Ismail Kucukkaya wrote in mainstream Aksam: "The feudal structure in 
the southeast has been kept or even encouraged by the state because 
it was easy for the system to control.  Now is the very time to wake 
up about the dangers that might effect the whole society." 
 
Fehmi Koru wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "With this 
massacre, the village guard system was caught red handed.  This is 
something that should be dealt with immediately." 
 
FM Davutoglu Goes to TRNC for His First Official Visit 
Sabah, Zaman, Aksam, Hurriyet:  Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu 
went to northern Cyprus yesterday and openly declared Turkey's 
support for northern Cyprus on all kinds of issues.  Following his 
meeting with Turkish Cypriot Leader Mehmet Ali Talat, at Davutoglu 
told journalists, "Everyone should avoid any kind of step that would 
adversely affect the negotiation process.  Including the 
international courts, all parties should support the constructive 
efforts of President Talat.  What's important is to realize a final 
and fair solution in Cyprus and make it an island of peace and 
stability in the eastern Mediterranean." 
 
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc Visits Lebanon 
Mainstream Sabah and Islamist-oriented Zaman report that Deputy PM 
Bulent Arinc went to Lebanon yesterday as his first official visit. 
Minister Arinc met with Lebanese PM Siniora in Beirut and voiced 
support for Lebanon's national unity by saying "Turkey is a reliable 
friend of Lebanon and Turkey attaches big importance to national 
unity and domestic peace in Lebanon." 
 
Ergenekon Case is Being Closely Followed by the EU 
Mainstream Milliyet and Islamist-oriented Zaman report that during a 
session regarding Turkey's democratic process at the European 
Parliament, Commissioner Olli Rehn said Brussels closely follow the 
Ergenekon case, press freedom and the Kurdish issue.  He said "The 
 
ANKARA 00000663  002 OF 003 
 
 
Ergenekon probe should be pursued to the end.  It is questionable 
whether or not the rule of law principle was applied in the last 
waves of the probe or whether or not these were politically 
motivated."  Rehn also expressed concern over the recent 
developments about the freedom of press in Turkey and they would 
touch upon this issue in the next progress report. 
 
President Gul Holds a Meeting with MHP leader Devlet Bahceli 
Mainstream Milliyet reports that President Gul held a meeting with 
MHP leader Bahceli at the Presidential Palace yesterday. 
Reportedly, Bahceli said "we are not against the normalization 
process with Armenia.  However, this process should be pursued 
without damaging the ties with Azerbaijan.  If Turkey opens the 
border with Armenia, this would be interpreted as an acceptance of 
the Armenian occupation in Azeri territory." 
 
100 Civilians Killed in U.S. Operation in Afghanistan 
Flashy headlines condemn the latest U.S. strike in Afghanistan 
during which as many as 100 civilians were killed.  Mainstream 
Milliyet reports "There was a massacre of civilians in Afghanistan," 
when "American forces launched an air attack on the Western village 
of Ferah."  In "The U.S. Bombards a Village," leftist nationalist 
Cumhuriyet notes, "100 people were killed in another massacre in 
Afghanistan."  Liberal Radikal reports, "U.S. forces targeted two 
villages in clashes with the Taliban, but as many as 150 civilians 
may have been killed."  Leftist Taraf reports "The U.S. Kills A 
Large Number of Civilians."  Mainstream Sabah headlines, "Those 
Seeking Shelter in Their Homes Were Struck By U.S. Planes." 
Islamist oriented Yeni Safak criticizes the U.S. for "receiving 
President Karzai on Tuesday and launching an attack that killed 100 
civilians in Afghanistan the next day," noting that "Karzai kissed 
Nancy Pelosi's hand the day before the operation."  Mainstream 
Haberturk reports "The U.S. bombed civilians during an air operation 
in Afghanistan." 
 
NATO Exercises Begin 
Media outlets call the NATO exercises with Georgia 'controversial' 
due to Russia's objections.  Islamist-oriented Zaman headlines, 
"NATO Begins Its Controversial Georgia Exercises," that are being 
conducted "despite Russia's strong objections."  Liberal Radikal 
headlines, "NATO's Georgia Exercises Stretch Russia's Limits." 
Mainstream Milliyet exclaims in the mocking headline "A Threat to 
Russia!" that "Russia has called Georgia its biggest threat." 
 
Clinton Meets with Azeri and Armenian Foreign Ministers 
Leftist Taraf reports in "Hillary Clinton Joins the Case," that 
"U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met separately with 
Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Memmedyarov and Armenian Foreign 
Minister Nalbandian."  Mainstream Sabah reports "Nalbandian thanked 
the U.S. for supporting the normalization of ties with Turkey and 
for supporting a peaceful resolution to the Karabakh conflict," 
while, "Memmedyarov underscored Azerbaijan's strategic global 
value." 
 
The Af-Pak Summit Concludes 
In "While Pakistanis Are On the Streets, Their Leader Is in the 
U.S.," Islamist-oriented Zaman criticizes the Pakistani leader for 
being in the U.S. when Pakistani troops are fighting the Taliban and 
civilians are fleeing.  Liberal Radikal reports "The Civilian 
Massacre Overshadows the AfPak Summit."  Mainstream Sabah comments, 
"At the same time President Obama received Afghan President Karzai, 
U.S. soldiers launched an operation that killed 100 civilians." 
Meanwhile, CNN Turk reports "Obama Vows To Prevent Civilian 
Deaths." 
 
Editorial Commentary on PKK-Ceasefire 
 
Turker Alkan wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal: "The recent 
statements by the PKK's Karayilan that appeared in Milliyet seem to 
be an attempt by the PKK revises its struggle into a peaceful 
 
ANKARA 00000663  003 OF 003 
 
 
platform.  Karayilan's call should be taken seriously.  Even though 
his suggestion for a general amnesty for all militants is not as 
easy as it may sound, there are some other steps to take.  First of 
all, there should be accelerated steps toward cultural rights and 
democratization because these are fundamental citizen rights.  And 
the current repentance law can be made more applicable."
