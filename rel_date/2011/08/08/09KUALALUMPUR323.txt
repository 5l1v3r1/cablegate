Summary and Comment 
------------------- 
 
¶1.  (C) Prominent blogger and government critic Raja Petra 
Kamarudin, who was jailed for two months in 2008 under the 
Internal Security Act (ISA), failed to appear for his 
sedition trail on April 23, and the court subsequently issued 
a warrant for his arrest.  A member of his defense team 
informed poloff that Raja Petra, along with his wife, fled to 
the United Kingdom about two months ago on the belief that he 
would face eventual imprisonment for sedition. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: Raja Petra, Malaysia's most controversial 
on-line voice, will continue to be a nuisance to Prime 
Minister Najib's administration.  Not expecting to return to 
Malaysia anytime soon, we can expect Raja Petra to ratchet up 
his criticism and purported exposes during his self-imposed 
exile.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
Where is Raja Petra? 
-------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Raja Petra Kamarudin, an outspoken blogger and 
member of the Selangor state royal family failed to appear at 
Sessions Court for the continuation of his sedition trial on 
April 23.  The court subsequently issued a warrant for his 
arrest.  Raja Petra faced charges under the Sedition Act for 
articles he posted on his website, Malaysia Today, regarding 
the high-profile Altantuya murder case and the victim's 
alleged ties to Prime Minister Najib and his wife.  If 
convicted of sedition, he faces a maximum sentence of three 
years in jail. 
 
¶4.  (U) On April 23, Raja Petra posted on his website his 
reasons for not appearing in court.  He claimed Malaysian 
authorities intended to detain him under the ISA, as the 
Government had done in September 2008 (ref A-C).  He also 
stated the courts were unable to provide him with a fair 
trial and noted the government was using sedition charges and 
criminal defamation charges, in addition to detaining him 
under ISA, for linking the Prime Minister to the murdered 
Mongolian national Altantuya.  Raja Petra also mentioned that 
he had angered the Selangor royal family with his criticism 
of the Sultan of Perak related to the ruling coalition's 
takeover of Perak state government from the opposition, and 
therefore could not return to Selangor. 
 
Lawyer Confirms Departure for UK 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Poloff met with one of Raja Petra's lead lawyers on 
April 23.  The lawyer disclosed that following Raja Petra's 
last appearance in court in February Raja Petra's legal team 
concluded their client would be found guilty and imprisoned 
under the sedition charges, and informed Raja Petra 
accordingly.  The lawyer claimed that the ruling coalition's 
political influence over the court proceedings precluded a 
fair trail.  He said that Raja Petra, who holds both 
Malaysian and British passports, along with his wife had left 
for the UK some two months ago and remained there.  His 
departure was kept closely guarded with Raja Petra's closest 
friends remaining in the dark.  The lawyer said it was 
unclear if the Attorney General's Office realized Raja Petra 
had left Malaysia, as the prosecutor's public statements 
indicated he was still in the country.  After the court's 
issuance of an arrest warrant for Raja Petra, and a "show 
cause notice" for his wife as bail guarantor, some on-line 
articles suggested Raja Petra was in the UK.
