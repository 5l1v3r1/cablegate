¶1.  This is an action message.  Please see para 4. 
 
¶2.  Per ref A, AIT ECONOFF discussed the reported sightings 
of high seas driftnet vessels with Taiwan Deep Sea Fisheries 
Deputy Director Chen Yu-Chen. AIT left a written copy of the 
questions posed in ref A, as well as the pictures sent by 
email of the suspected ship.  Ms. Chen said, based on the 
information provided by AIT, that the ship is probably a 
foreign flagged vessel.  Ms. Chen explained that Taiwan 
prohibits high seas driftnet fishing on Taiwan flagged 
vessels or any ships that dock in Taiwan ports.  ECONOFF 
pointed out that evidence in ref A suggests that the owner 
of the foreign flagged vessel is based in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. 
Ms. Chen promised to investigate the matter and provide any 
information she finds.  ECONOFF emphasized the importance of 
trying to provide information prior to the upcoming ICCAT 
bilateral meetings on 28 and 29 October 2005.  Ms. Chen 
promised to do her best to respond as soon as possible. 
 
¶3. AIT ECON Chief also raised this issue September 14 with 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, North American Affairs Division 
Deputy Director General Kelly W. Hsieh. Hsieh said his 
office will work with the Fisheries Administration to answer 
the questions posed in ref A.  He asked for information on 
the exact location of the vessel and any additional 
information that would help to identify the ship.  AIT 
ECONOFF is following up on his request. 
 
¶4.  Action Request:  We would appreciate any further 
information to respond to the questions posed in para 3.
