SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: On August 1, Secretary Paulson and State 
Forestry Administration (SFA) Administrator Jia Zhibang 
agreed on the need for the United States and China to 
collaborate on sustainable logging issues and asked staff to 
follow up at the working level.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Administrator Jia provided a brief introduction to 
the responsibilities of SFA, which include planting of trees, 
management of forest products, biodiversity, conservation of 
endangered wildlife, wetlands conservation and combating 
desertification.  Administrator Jia boasted of the recent 
increase in investment in forest development and the number 
of forest conservation programs under SFA.  The Chinese 
government has invested over 330 billion RMB on forest 
conservation projects in 25 provinces, said Jia. 
Administrator Jia stated that forest coverage in China has 
increased from 8% in 1949 to 18.21% at present.  He said 
these programs not only benefit local farmers but also 
benefit the world's forest resources.  Jia explained that 
although China has huge forests, it also has huge demand that 
can only be satisfied through imports.  Jia said that SFA 
also supports China's energy efficiency and pollution 
reduction goals by working on carbon sequestration and 
biofuels. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Secretary Paulson discussed his visit to Qinghai 
Lake to witness China's efforts on desertification, and 
referred to his prior experience with conservation and 
biodiversity work in China, suggesting that this could be 
another area where both sides could share best practices. 
Secretary Paulson discussed the role of the SED in bilateral 
 
SIPDIS 
relations and the importance of energy, environment and 
climate change at the SED.  He emphasized the importance of 
cooperation in areas such as sustainable logging, and noted 
the increased responsibility of the United States and China 
as the largest importer and exporter respectively of forest 
products in the world.  Secretary Paulson said that the 
United States and China should lead by example.  He 
recognized China's work on combating illegal logging within 
China, and suggested that if the United States and China work 
together to combat illegal logging in other countries, both 
would benefit.  Secretary Paulson said benefits include: 
maintaining old growth forests reduces climate change; 
science-based sustainable logging practices maintains 
resources; and preventing illegal logging stops other illegal 
activities and strengthens border security. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Administrator Jia agreed with Paulson's points and 
said the key issue was to strengthen law enforcement.  He 
explained domestic enforcement mechanisms, such as 
enforcement task forces, certification requirements to log 
trees in China and making logging quotas less than the 
incremental increase of forest coverage.  Secretary Paulson 
agreed on the importance of law enforcement but reiterated 
that peventing illegal practices in other counties isneeded 
to realize the goal.  Jia said that he was interested in 
further collaboration with Paulson on this issue and the next 
steps should be discussion at the working level.  Jia said 
that officials from SFA's International Cooperation 
Department and Planning and Finance Department, both 
attending the meeting, would follow up on collaboration 
opportunities.
