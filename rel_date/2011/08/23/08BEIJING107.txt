Yu told reporters that EAP A/S Hill would meet with VFM Wu Dawei 
that afternoon.  Regarding the Six-Party Talks, Jiang said that the

take place January 17-18, led by Deputy Secretary Negroponte and VFM 
Dai Bingguo.  The two sides will hold an "in-depth exchange of views 
on major international and regional issues of mutual interest," she 
added. 
 
African Development 
------------------- 
 
¶4. In response to a reporter's question, Jiang said she had not 
heard of a possible new EU "mechanism" for African development, but 
that China is "open" to cooperation with countries and organizations 
that have a "sincere" interest in African development.  She added 
that China and the EU both have experienced long-term friendship and 
cooperation with Africa, and both strive for peace, stability and 
sustainable development in the region. 
 
Malawi, Marshall Islands to Recognize PRC? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. China is willing to develop friendly relations with any country 
on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the 
one-China principle, Jiang said when asked about the possibility of 
Malawi and the Marshall Islands establishing formal diplomatic ties 
with the PRC. 
 
Japanese Company Recalls Globes over Taiwan Name? 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶6. The spokesperson did not have any specifics regarding a 
reporter's question about a recall of globes made by a Japanese 
company in China depicting Taiwan as part of the People's Republic 
of China.  Jiang nevertheless stated that the international 
community "universally recognizes" the one-China principle and that 
companies operating in China "must abide by Chinese laws and 
regulations." 
 
Swiss Equestrian Team Withdrawal, ROK Explosion, Iran

withdrawal from the 2008 Olympic Games because of concerns over the 
climate in Hong Kong to the "relevant authorities."  She had no new 
information on the 12 Chinese citizens reportedly killed in the 
January 7 explosion in the ROK.  Jiang appeared to misunderstand a 
question regarding U.S. claims that Iran has been using banks as 
channels for financing terrorism, responding that the nuclear issue 
should be solved through dialogue and negotiation.
