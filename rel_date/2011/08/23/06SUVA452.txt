FOREIGN MINISTER IN FIJI

¶1. (SBU) Summary: China pressed on U.S. diplomats at the Pacific 
Islands Forum (PIF) summit in Nadi, Fiji, to cancel an informal 
encounter between Assistant Secretary Christopher Hill and Taiwan 
Vice Foreign Minister Chang Siao-Yue.  Beijing's new special envoy 
for PIF affairs, Ambassador Wang Yongqui, requested a meeting with 
ANP Office Director Steven McGann to argue that a Hill-Chang meeting 
was too high-level to be regarded as "informal" and could have 
negative consequences for U.S.-China relations.  He obliquely warned 
that the meeting could somehow impact on U.S.-China efforts to deal 
with the North Korea situation.  McGann noted to Wang that the Forum 
and not the United States had invited Taiwan to Nadi, based on its 
role as a donor nation in the Pacific.  McGann said the encounter 
would be in line with other such occasional meetings with Taiwan 
officials in informal settings, consistent with standing U.S. 
practices and policies, of which China is well aware.  He dismissed 
any possible linkage to the North Korea issues.  Chinese Ambassador 
to Fiji, Cai Jinbiao, also spoke to Ambassador Dinger by phone, 
pushing the same points.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a hurriedly arranged meeting October 25 in Nadi, 
Ambassador Wang met with ANP's McGann to deliver a demarche calling 
on Assistant Secretary Hill not to go ahead with a meeting with Vice 
Minister Chang, due to arrive the evening of the 25th in Nadi.  Wang 
said the Chinese MFA's DG for U.S. and North American Affairs had 
directed him to deliver the demarche.  He said the MFA would also 
approach the U.S. Embassy in Beijing on the matter (reftel).  Wang 
highlighted common U.S. and Chinese interests in the Pacific, and 
accused Taiwan of using its aid to corrupt governments in the 
region.  He noted recent improvements in international cooperation 
on "Taiwan Straits" matters and urged the United States not to meet 
with Taiwan officials at the summit, as this would "confuse" other 
nations as to the U.S. position and would support the Taiwan 
government's efforts to legitimize its policies.  Wang insisted that 
a meeting with an official of Hill's stature is too high-level to be 
seen as "informal." 
 
¶3. (SBU) McGann emphasized to Wang that any encounter with 
representatives of Taiwan would be in keeping with the longstanding 
USG policies of One China, the Three Communiqus and the Taiwan 
Relations Act.  Beijing is aware that U.S. officials occasionally 
meet with representatives of Taiwan in informal situations, and the 
meeting in Nadi would be of this character.  The United States would 
not discuss or mention the meeting to other delegates.  Taiwan is 
present because the PIF secretariat had invited it as a significant 
donor, McGann said.  He added that China and the United States have 
a common interest in donor coordination, good governance and the 
rule of law in the Pacific.  The United States, he said, has no wish 
to be in the middle of competition between China and Taiwan in 
wooing Pacific Island States.  He told Wang that the meeting with 
Chang would go ahead.  He encouraged China not to focus on the Chang 
meeting, but instead to recognize the far greater significance of 
the U.S. invitation for China to attend a U.S.-hosted meeting of 
"Core Donor Partners" planned for October 26 in Nadi.  The meeting 
will bring together representatives of China, Japan, Korea, the EU, 
the UK, Australia, New Zealand and France. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Just prior to the McGann-Wang meeting, Chinese Ambassador 
to Fiji Cai phoned Ambassador Dinger on the issue and made the same 
plea that Hill not meet with Chang.  The Ambassador drew on talking 
points provided by Washington in responding.
