¶1. In response to Reftel, AIT ESTOFF discussed sea turtle 
points with Fisheries Administration Senior Specialist Huang 
Hong-yen on November 15.  Huang informed AIT that he will 
represent the Taiwan NGO FDCI (Fisheries Development Council 
International) as an observer at the meeting.  He further 
indicated that Dr. Chen Tien-hsi, a biologist and turtle 
expert with Taiwan's National Museum of Marine Science and 
Technology, will represent the International Coalition of 
Fisheries Association as an observer (ICFA is an 
international NGO headquartered in Virginia). 
 
¶2.  Huang mentioned that, although no one from Taiwan 
attended the March 2004 FAO "Expert Consultation on 
Interactions between Sea Turtles and Fisheries in the 
Ecosystem Context", he has read the meeting report on the FAO 
web-site.  He also indicated that Taiwan has deployed 
observers on board its fishing vessels operating in three 
oceans to collect bycatch data on sea birds, sea turtles and 
other species.  He further told AIT that Taiwan is conducting 
a circle-hook pilot program in its deep-seas longline 
fisheries to reduce the mortality of sea turtles.  He noted, 
however, that more data and analysis would be needed before 
the program could be introduced to Taiwan's fishing fleet. 
Huang believes that more needs to be done to reduce sea 
turtle bycatch.  He is looking forward to attending the FAO 
Technical Consultations to collect information and share 
views on the conservation of sea turtles in fisheries.
