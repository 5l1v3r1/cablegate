SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S. BEEF IMPORTS TO TAIWAN 
 
¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage November 6 on the earthquake that struck Nantou County on 
Thursday evening, on the breakout of H1N1 swine flu on a pig farm in 
Taitung, which was the first case of man-to-pig infection in Taiwan; 
and on Premier Wu Den-yih's relationship with a convicted felon. 
 
¶2. In terms of editorials and commentaries, a column by a local 
well-known radio host and an op-ed by DPP Legislator Ker Chien-ming 
in the mass-circulation "Apple Daily" both alleged that a joint 
statement released by the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was a 
warning to the Ma Ying-jeou administration over the Ma 
administration's use of administrative measures to ban risky U.S. 
beef products.  The two articles questioned the effectiveness and 
legitimacy of those administrative means.  Those measures might hurt 
the Ma administration's credibility as well, said the two articles. 
End summary. 
 
A) "Cleaning Up the Mess Left by a Wrongdoing and Incompetent 
Government" 
 
DPP Legislator Ker Chien-ming wrote an op-ed in the mass-circulation 
"Apple Daily" [circulation: 520,000] (11/6): 
 
"... In fact, the Executive Yuan's administrative measures [to ban 
the import of risky U.S. beef products] have [drawn] a warning by 
the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  [USTR and USDA] 
stated that the [Taiwan government's] moves have violated a protocol 
signed between Taiwan and the United States.  The legislature's move 
to revise the law [the Act Governing Food Sanitation] and the 
signature drive to hold a referendum [which would require the 
government to renegotiate the beef deal with the United States] are 
actually more legitimate than using administrative means to bar [the 
import of risky U.S. beef products] and less susceptible to trade 
retaliation by opponents.  On the contrary, [the Ma administration's 
move to] unilaterally use administrative measures to limit [U.S. 
beef imports] after singing the protocol ... [violates] the protocol 
it signed.  The [Ma administration's use of these] measures is like 
openly cheating another signatory state and is more likely to be 
questioned. ..." 
 
B) "Beef Bones, Beef Offal, and Beef Slaughterhouse" 
 
Jaw Shao-kong, a radio program host, wrote in his column in the 
mass-circulation "Apple Daily" [circulation: 520,000] (11/6): 
 
"... The [Ma Ying-jeou] government's 'administrative measures,' 
especially thawing U.S. beef offal and ground beef for examination, 
are bad tricks, dirty tricks and absolutely vile tricks that are 
neither open nor aboveboard at all.  The government should be frank 
and upright, rather than playing shameful tricks. ... The [Ma] 
government was complacent, and thought that it had attended to every 
detail by meeting the Americans' request as well as echoing the 
public opinion in Taiwan.  It [the Ma government] even claimed that 
it has obtained a tacit understanding with Americans and had 
Americans' understanding [on the administrative measures].  ... I 
saw the Office of the United States Trade Representative and the 
Secretary of United States Department of Agriculture saying that 
they want to review whether the measures that Taiwan imposed on 
imported [U.S. beef] are consistent with the protocol and other 
international guidelines; whether [the measures] would limit Taiwan 
consumers' right of choice and therefore prevent the people of 
Taiwan from eating the American beef and beef products that 
Americans have been eating. 
 
"If opening [Taiwan's market] is equivalent to not opening [Taiwan's 
market] and [you are] letting the Americans down in the end, do you 
think the Americans would let it go at that?  According to [American 
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Director] William Stanton's style, would 
he just laugh the matter off? 
 
"It was originally said that opening [Taiwan's market] to U.S. beef 
spinal cords and beef offal would get three major things in return 
[from the United States], which are a free trade agreement, the F-16 
C/D fighter jets and the visa-waiver treatment for the people of 
Taiwan.  Now, [the Ma administration] wants to use 'administrative 
measures' plus thawing Americans' beef.  How can [the Ma 
administration] get [anything] in return in the future? ..."
