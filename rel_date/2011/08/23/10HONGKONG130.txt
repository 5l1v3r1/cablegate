SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 050197283 
 
REF: 09 SECSTATE 131175 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per reftel request, post conducted a pre-license 
check on application 050197283 for the export to Hong Kong of 
an infrared camera which is part of an infrared microscope. 
In post's assessment, the Hong Kong Heritage Museum, which is 
under the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's (HKSARG) 
Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), is a 
reliable recipient of reftel item. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 15, Post's Blue Lantern Coordinator (BLC) 
and Economic Officer met with Mr. Lai Wing-fai, Assistant 
Curator, and Ms. Tang Man-wai, Assistant Curator II 
(Conservation), from the Central Conservation Section at the 
Hong Kong Heritage Museum in the Sha Tin district.  The Hong 
Kong Heritage Museum will be using reftel item.  Mr. Lai 
provided BLC a copy of the HKSARG purchasing documents for 
reftel item, including brochures from manufacturer Bruker 
Optics.  Mr. Lai's office will use reftel item to analyze 
organic material in the museum's collection, including paint. 
 He added that museum staff needed to understand the nature 
of materials to employ proper preservation techniques.  This 
is in line with the stated purpose of using reftel item, 
i.e., to carry out non-invasive microanalysis of museum 
artwork and collections in order to create a museum 
conservation plan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) LCSD has secure facilities and proper accounting and 
security procedures for handling reftel item.  Mr. Lai had 
registered BLC and Economic Officer as visitors at the 
museum's employee entrance, which allowed access to the 
conservation and collection storage areas.  The venue 
maintains a 24-hour guard presence.  After passing a manned 
guard station, Mr. Lai used a key card at the employee 
entrance, then the group passed two additional guards before 
arriving at the Central Conservation Section's office.  This 
office was secured with a key lock and a combination lock. 
The museum conducts an annual equipment inventory.  Museum 
staff will retain positive control of reftel item at all 
times. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The work of the LCSD involving reftel item will take 
place at the Sha Tin office of the Hong Kong Heritage Museum. 
 The work will not involve persons from the People's Republic 
of China (PRC).  Although the office has interns, they are 
supervised and usually come from places such as Germany, 
Portugal, and Macau.  There is little cooperation with the 
PRC in the office's work.  This office has not previously 
sought or purchased United States Munitions List (USML) 
items, although it has purchased equipment similar to reftel 
infrared microscope from the Netherlands in the past.  BLC 
and Economic Officer explained restrictions on USML items, 
including the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer 
and re-export, and passed Mr. Lai an information sheet 
containing contact information for the Directorate of Defense 
Trade Controls (DDTC) Response Team.
