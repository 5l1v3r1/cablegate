SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: CHINA'S NATIONAL DEFENSE WHITE 
PAPER 
 
A) "Face Directly the War Threats Toward Taiwan Imposed 
by China's `National Defense White Paper'" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" editorialized 
(12/29): 
 
"The situation that the [national defense] white paper 
and the anti-secession law came out together fully 
demonstrates the concern of the Chinese authorities 
toward the direction of Taiwan.  Hence, even if China 
cannot resist the trend and the will of people in 
Taiwan to seek independence and autonomy, China still 
intends to step up the threats and the bluffing to 
effortlessly confront popular opinion in Taiwan. 
 
"In sum, one sentence for the 30-thousand-word white 
paper is that its purpose is pointed at Taiwan.  China 
has been trying to devour Taiwan more and more each 
day, and China does not hide its intention to use force 
against Taiwan.  Under such a serious threat, Taiwan 
should establish enough defense capabilities as its 
first priority.  Hence, objectively considering the 
situation in the evolving international environment, 
Taiwan should grasp the precious chance when the United 
States is willing to sell such advanced weapons, such 
as submarines, anti-submarine planes, and the Patriot 
missiles to Taiwan. ." 
 
B) "Chen Must Change His Route to Avert a Beijing 
Invasion" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification "China Post" 
editorialized (12/29): 
 
"It's about time that President Chen Shui-bian made a 
choice between continuously pursuing independence and 
averting a conflict with mainland China.  Should he 
decided to choose the former, Taiwan will eventually 
have to fight a communist invasion on its own without 
aid from its U.S. ally. 
 
"The challenge now facing Chen is that he must revise 
his independence route by moving toward the political 
center.  Failing to do so, he is certain to risk waging 
a devastating war with China without the United States 
coming to bail Taiwan out."
