1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post shipment-verification (PSV) at Institute of Bioengineering 
and Nanotechnology, 31 Biopolis Way, the Nanos, Singapore 
(Institute). The item in question is a Motionpro X4 high speed 
camera exported to the Institute on or about July 11, 2007 and 
valued at USD 27,996.  This item is classified under export control 
classification number (ECCN) 6A003 and is controlled for national 
security (NS) reasons.  The exporter was Redlake MASD of Tuscon 
Arizona. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore Companies Registry, the Institute was 
registered in 2003. Its principal activities are research and 
experimental development on life sciences.  According to its web 
site, the Institute was established to spearhead the advancement of 
biomedical sciences in Singapore.  It is a Singapore state sponsored 
institute located at Biopolis, a world-class biomedical sciences 
research and development hub in Asia. 
 
¶4.  On April 22, 2008, ECO, accompanied by a representative of 
Singapore Customs, visited the Institute and met with Dr. Li, 
Mo-Huang, Senior Research Scientist.  He provided background 
information about the Institute.  In particular, he stated that the 
Institute is funded by the Singapore Government and is broken into 
five groups (nanoparticles, biomedical devices, molecular biology, 
tissue engineering and bio-sensors).  Dr. Li's work focuses on 
biomedical devices and, in particular, improving systems to conduct 
tests on DNA. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Li confirmed that he had received the license conditions. He 
also stated that the camera is kept under lock and key when it is 
not in use and may only be used by persons in his research group. 
ECO notes that access to the research area and the building as a 
whole is restricted by key card access points and security at the 
front entrance of the building. 
 
¶6.  ECO viewed the camera with serial number 24-0207-0197.  It is 
kept under lock and key in Dr. Li's office. 
 
¶7.  At the time visited, the Institute appeared to be a suitable 
recipient of the subject controlled item since it cooperated fully 
with the PSV and provided substantial information on the Institute's 
use of the item.
