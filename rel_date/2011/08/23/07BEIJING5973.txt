Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. Key points at the September 12 Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) 
press briefing were: 
 
-- If Chen disregards the "condemnation of the international 
community" regarding his "independence provocations," he will 
"bear responsibility for all consequences." 
 
-- Olympic Committees on both sides of the Strait continue to 
discuss the Olympic torch route issue because of the large 
number of Taiwan compatriots who wish to see the torch pass 
through Taiwan. 
 
-- The Shin Kong Mitsukoshi - Beijing Hualian Group conflict 
was merely a "business dispute," as confirmed in a joint 
statement released the two parties. 
 
-- At a September 6 conference in Xiamen, Vice Premier Wu Yi 
encouraged cross-Strait economic interaction and pledged to 
help Taiwan businesses solve problems encountered on the 
Mainland.  End Summary. 
 
Chen Shui-bian Responsible for "All Consequences" 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. At the September 12 regular Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) 
press briefing, spokesman Li Weiyi criticized Chen 
Shui-bian's "Taiwan independence provocations" when asked 
about Chen's "separatist comments" by a Xinhua News Agency 
reporter.  Li accused Chen of ignoring the rights and 
interests of Taiwan's 23 million compatriots and reiterated 
the "immutable fact" that Taiwan is a part of one China.  If 
Chen disregards the "condemnation of the international 
community", he will "bear responsibility for all 
consequences," Li added.  Later in the press briefing, Li 
added that Chen's intended referendum on UN membership would 
change the status quo that both sides of the Strait belong to 
one China and is an act of "Taiwan independence."  Thus, it 
naturally is Chen who would bear responsibility for all 
consequences. 
 
Cross-Strait Olympic Committees Discuss Torch Route 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶3. Olympic Committees on both sides of the Strait continue to 
discuss the Olympic torch route issue, Li said in response to 
a reporter's questions, because Taiwan authorities considered 
the large number of Taiwan compatriots who wish to see the 
torch pass through Taiwan.  Li pointed out that Taiwan had 
previously "unilaterally" rejected a consensus already 
reached between the two sides in February 2007 and approved 
by the International Olympic Committee in April. 
 
Shin Kong - Hualian Issue Merely a "Business Dispute" 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. Li said a conflict between Taiwan's Shin Kong Mitsukoshi, 
which runs department stores on the Mainland, and the Beijing 
Hualian Group was merely a "business dispute," as confirmed 
in a joint statement released the two parties.  Shin Kong 
expressed its regret and Beijing Hualian stated there was a 
"misunderstanding" and apologized, Li continued.  Asked if 
the detention by Chinese authorities of Shin Kong General 
Manager Wu Shin-da after he had boarded an international 
flight in China was legal, the spokesman replied that public 
security departments took "emergency measures in accordance 
with relevant regulations." 
 
Wu Yi's Remarks on Assisting Taiwan Businessmen 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5. In response to a question about Taiwan business concerns 
regarding adjustments to the Mainland's trade policies, the 
spokesman said such adjustments are "legitimate and 
necessary" and are based solely on the needs of China's 
macroeconomic development and changes in the global trade 
environment.  The spokesman further noted that, at a 
September 6 conference in Xiamen, Vice Premier Wu Yi and 21 
other State Council officials conducted face-to-face 
discussions with Taiwanese business representatives, at which 
time Wu Yi encouraged greater interaction between both sides 
of the Strait on economic matters, listened to the concerns 
of Taiwan businesses and pledged to help them solve problems 
encountered on the Mainland. 
 
Cross-Strait Tourism Issues Unresolved 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
BEIJING 00005973  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶6. Li acknowledged that many technical issues had been worked 
out in six rounds of negotiations on the issue of Mainland 
tourism to Taiwan, but that some problems still exist.  He 
expressed hope that the Taiwan side would increase its 
efforts to solve these issues. 
 
Yao Ming's Taiwan Visit 
----------------------- 
 
¶7. Li expressed regret over "irrational hindrance" of Yao 
Ming's visit to Taiwan by Taiwan authorities and remarked 
that he did not know "what they were afraid of."  Li said Yao 
Ming was eventually welcomed and well received by the Taiwan 
public. 
 
Cross-Strait Civil Aviation Exchange 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8. Asked about media reports on the desire for a cross-Strait 
civil aviation mechanism for investigating accidents, the 
spokesman said he was aware of previous communications on 
this issue and that the TAO hopes such contact and 
communication between civil aviation authorities will 
continue.
