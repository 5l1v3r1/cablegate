SOURCE UNKNOWN, NO HUMAN CASES 
 
REF: A. HONG KONG 1034 
     ¶B. HONG KONG 470 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: On June 11, the Hong Kong Government (HKG) 
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) 
announced additional positive test results for H5N1 virus in 
live poultry in Hong Kong wet markets, bringing the total to 
four markets infected to date.  As a result, all poultry 
sales were suspended at markets and retail shops, birds 
culled, and markets disinfected.  The H5N1 detected in Hong 
Kong wet markets belongs to clade 2.3.4 - known previously as 
the Fujian strain.  While the virus has shown no signs of 
mutation, the source of the virus in these chickens is not 
yet known.  The HKG renewed vigilance across all responsible 
agencies, activating its information hotline, and expanding 
inspections.  Post's Avian Influenza Working Group is 
actively monitoring all new developments, and Emergency 
Action Plan measures and tripwires are up-to-date.  End 
Summary. 
 
New Cases of H5N1 in Poultry 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On June 11, the HKG AFCD announced additional positive 
test results for H5N1 virus in live poultry at Hong Kong wet 
markets, bringing the total to four markets infected to date. 
 As a result, all poultry sales were suspended at markets and 
retail shops, birds culled, and markets disinfected.  On June 
7, the HKG suspended live poultry imports for twenty-one 
days, and has not ruled out an extension of this ban.  Note: 
Additional information on the Hong Kong poultry market will 
follow septel from the Consulate's Ag Trade Office.  End 
note. 
 
Fujian Strain of H5N1, But Source Still Unknown 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3. (U) The H5N1 detected in Hong Kong wet markets belongs to 
clade 2.3.4 - known previously as the Fujian strain.  The 
virus has shown no signs of mutation, however the source of 
the virus in these chickens is not yet known.  AFCD officials 
have inspected all fifty local chicken farms; all tests have 
proven negative, and inspectors found no abnormalities.  HKG 
officials have not ruled out the possibility of smuggling 
from mainland China particularly as demand for and trade in 
poultry is highest during holiday periods (Note: Hong Kong 
celebrated a local holiday on June 8). 
 
HKG Preparedness 
---------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The HKG has been at "serious-alert level" since 
February's reports of two human avian influenza cases on the 
mainland.  Following the June 7 detection of the H5N1 virus 
in Hong Kong for the first time in five years, government 
bureaus have taken additional steps as follows: 
--Centre for Health Protection: activation of its inquiry 
hotline, dissemination of reporting guidance for clinics and 
hospitals, and medical surveillance for exposed workers. 
--Hospital Authority: enhancing triage assessment and patient 
segregation measures, directing potential human cases to be 
sent to the Princess Margaret Hospital Infectious Disease 
Center, and expanding support by the laboratory network for 
testing. 
--AFCD: testing and inspecting all farms and markets, 
suspending live poultry imports, culling markets and 
disposing of carcasses, and reviewing biosecurity measures. 
--Customs and Excise: increasing inspection at the borders 
and investigating source of infected birds.

Post Preparedness 
----------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post has been operating at "serious-alert level" in 
parallel to the HKG since late winter 2008.  Post's Avian 
Influenza Working Group is actively monitoring all new 
developments, and Emergency Action Plan measures and 
tripwires are up-to-date.  Post continues to provide 
information to American citizens via the Consulate website, 
to American businesses via OSAC and the American Chamber, and 
to Post employees through administrative notices and the 
Intranet. 
 
Media Pressure Intense 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. Comment: While the average Hong Kong citizen is interested 
in H5N1 developments, there is no outward evidence of 
concern.  We are not seeing individuals wearing face masks 
and there are many shoppers in the markets.   Most infectious 
disease experts in Hong Kong have acknowledged that the virus 
is present in the region as evidenced by six migratory birds 
found with H5N1 in Hong Kong this year, and it would 
eventually be found again in the poultry supply.  However, 
media coverage has been extensive and unrelenting in calls 
for a quicker response at the initial sign of the virus on 
June 7, in demands for a central slaughterhouse in Shenzhen 
to strengthen biosecurity measures, and in reaction to 
poultry traders demands for compensation.  Increasing media 
and public opinion pressure has the potential to cause an 
abundance of caution by the HKG in its action, as seen in 
March when primary school were closed for two weeks at the 
height of peak seasonal influenza season (reftel B).  End 
comment.
