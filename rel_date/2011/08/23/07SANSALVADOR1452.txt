Multilateral Affairs for the Salvadoran Ministry of foreign 
Affairs (MFA) to raise reftel points.  Rivera responded that 
El Salvador is fully supportive of the US position on the 
participation in the Community of Democracies. 
 
¶2. (U) Rivera agreed that it was important that full 
participant status be reserved for fully democratic 
countries. He also agreed that, in light of developments in

invited. He further supported the position that Nigeria and 
Russia be invited only as observers.

relations with Taiwan, and Rivera confirmed that El Salvador 
supports "Special Guest" status for Taiwan.  In a separate 
conversation, the MFA confirmed that they would be willing to 
jointly invite Taiwan to the meeting along with the Czech 
Republic.
