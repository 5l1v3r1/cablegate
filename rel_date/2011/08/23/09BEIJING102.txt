  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "U.S.-China cooperation promotes world peace" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (01/13): 
"For these two countries, the U.S.-China relationship has become one 
of their most important global partnerships. Their relationship is 
acquiring more and more influence in multilateral relationships, and 
more and more common interest within the international society. This 
improvement has happened amidst two important backgrounds: first, 
along with economic globalization some regional issues have become 
global issues and the two countries have common interests that are 
closer than ever; interests which are represented in broad global 
fields. And second, along with the rapid development in China, the 
Chinese relationship with the World has changed. Therefore, the 
effect of these 'global relations' between the U.S. and China has 
become more prominent. The U.S.-China cooperation will explore a new 
model of cooperation between a developing country and a developed 
country. The cooperation between these two countries is an example 
for the World." 
 
b. "'Issues that lack attention' will enrich the U.S.-China 
relationship" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/13): "Over the last 30 years, those issues 
that have mattered most to the U.S. and China have been bilateral 
issues. However, in the future, the global situation will change. It 
is likely that multilateral issues will receive more attention in 
the relationship because of the objective need to do so, regardless 
of the international reality or the subjective opinions of the two 
countries. Different from Bush, Obama has repeatedly emphasized 
multilateral cooperation, especially on environment and energy 
issues. These issues have exceeded the scope of the U.S.-China 
bilateral relations, and are closely related with China's interests. 
What's more, China has enough potential to provide help to the U.S. 
in both of these fields. China can play an irreplaceable role on 
issues such as Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are relatively 
less important to China. Nowadays, bilateral relationships will 
hardly solve global issues. In the future, the two countries must 
enhance their cooperation in multilateral fields." 
 
¶2. ISRAEL 
 
"It is said Israel wants to reoccupy Gaza" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/13): "Chinese experts have indicated that 
if Israel truly wants to reoccupy Gaza, Gaza will become the 
frontline of the entire Arab world's war against Israel and that the 
World will not have any peace. The experts suggest that the 21st 
century will be turned into a century filled with cultural conflict 
because of this war. Chinese analysts indicate that the endless 
conflicts between Israel and Palestine are due to three reasons: 
cultural conflicts, fights for living space [territory] and 
deep-rooted hatred. During this conflict, Israel is facing a 
congressional election and the tougher party has received more 
support. Thus the experts suggest that it is in this Israeli 
political group's interest to cause this Israel-Palestinian 
conflict. And thus, the conflict is seen as a war caused by Western 
democracy. It seems Israel and Palestine, even the whole Middle 
East, has been an experimental field for cultural conflicts.
