SUBJECT: THAT WAS JUST A DREAM: HAINAN NOT LOSING ITS 
RELIGION, DESPITE OFFICIAL CLAIMS 
 
 
(U) THIS DOCUMENT IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE 
PROTECT ACCORDINGLY.  NOT FOR RELEASE OUTSIDE U.S. 
GOVERNMENT CHANNELS.  NOT FOR INTERNET PUBLICATION. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  According to Hainan officials, only 
80,000 Hainanese, or about 1% of Hainan's population, 
practice an officially sanctioned religion.  Of these, 
40,000, or half, are Protestants.  For Hainan's government, 
the protection of religious freedom is important, but the 
need to "coordinate" religion with socialist principles is 
at least equally important.  Meanwhile, first-hand 
observations suggest that the real number of believers in 
Hainan far surpasses 80,000.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On March 25, Consulate and Embassy officers met in 
Haikou with Yang Zhenxiong, chief of the religious affairs 
section of the Hainan Department of Nationalities and 
Religious Affairs (DNRA), as part of a visit designed to 
glean insight into the state of religion in Hainan.  Yang 
was accompanied by an unidentified colleague from his 
section.  After the meeting we visited a "patriotic," i.e., 
officially authorized, Protestant church.  We will report on 
that visit via a separate telegram. 
 
Officially, just 1% of the population practices religion 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶3. (U) According to DNRA, all of China's officially 
recognized religions are present in Hainan, with almost 
80,000 believers, 132 registered religious venues, 35 
religious groups (i.e., congregations) and 400 religious 
professionals. 
 
Officially, more Protestants than anything else 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. (U) Hainan's largest official religion in terms of 
followers is Christianity, i.e., Protestantism, with 40,000 
faithful, or half of all officially sanctioned believers in 
Hainan.  The complete breakdown is: 
 
- 40,000 Christians (Protestants) 
- 20,000 Buddhists 
- 10,000 Taoists 
- 8,000 Muslims 
- 1,000 Catholics 
 
The New Socialist Religion? 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) According to the DNRA officials, Hainan's government 
has always (i.e., since 1988, when Hainan was separated from 
Guangdong and established as a separate province) attached 
"great importance" to religious freedom.  At the same time, 
it has strived to "coordinate" religious practices with 
socialist principles.  Religion must "comply" with the 
society of the time, and the government "encourages" 
religious followers "to serve society." 
 
¶6. (U) In addition to facilitating the recovery of some 
290,000 square meters (about 88,415 square feet) of 
religious venues that were confiscated in the past, the 
Hainan government has also permitted the construction of new 
venues when these have become necessary.  Meanwhile, the 
participation of religious followers in politics is 
encouraged.  Presently, there are 32 religious followers 
either serving in Hainan's provincial legislature or holding 
leadership positions in Hainan's branch of the Communist 
Party.  Hainan's government also deems it important to 
"nurture" religious followers, and to this end has sent 39 
religious professional to training in universities and in 
specialized sessions. 
 
Comment:  An incomplete picture of faith in Hainan 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Our interlocutors were probably right when they 
claimed that only one out of every 100 Hainanese professed 
an officially sanctioned religion.  Likewise, there is no 
reason to question the assertion that, of that 1%, more than 
half are Christians (including both Protestants and 
Catholics).  However, the burning incense sticks and posters 
of the goddess of mercy Guanyin that are plentiful in Haikou 
suggest the real number of believers is much higher.  In 
particular, the number of Buddhists must certainly be much 
higher than 20,000.  Some of the uncounted believers

probably make a conscious decision to practice their faith 
outside the official realm.  Others probably just do not 
care enough. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Moreover, the indigenous beliefs of ethnic groups 
such as the Li are not accounted for at all in the official 
numbers, even though, as Yang explained, the Li do "worship 
totems."  So the islanders of Hainan are probably not the 
godless lot that official numbers could lead one to believe.
