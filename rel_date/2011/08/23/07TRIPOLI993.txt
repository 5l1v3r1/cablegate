RENEWABLE ENERGY CONFERENCE 
 
REF: A) STATE 138248, B) GODFREY-LAWSON E-MAIL 11/21/2007 
 
Per reftel, Post requests that Libya be added to the list of 
invitees for the March 2008 Washington International Renewable 
Energy Conference (WIREC).  The GOL has demonstrated keen 
interest in developing its renewable energy sector and could 
represent a sizeable market for renewable technologies in the 
future.  In addition, scientific engagement and cooperation have 
constituted an important component of the re-establishment of 
formal U.S.-Libyan diplomatic ties; participation by the GOL in 
the WIREC 2008 event would represent another significant step in 
the re-establishment of regular government-to-government ties 
outside the strictly political sphere.
