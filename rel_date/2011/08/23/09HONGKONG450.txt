HEADLINES AND EXCERPTS: 
 
¶1. U.S.-China relations 
 
"Undercover antics and impeccable farce" 
 
The independent English-language South China Morning Post's senior 
writer, Alex Lo, wrote in the 'Observer' column (3/12):  "Wasn't it 
one of the Marx brothers who said history repeats itself - the first 
time as tragedy, the second time as farce?  The latest confrontation 
between five Chinese vessels and a U.S. navy ship off Hainan Island 
is reminiscent of a similar incident almost eight years ago....  As 
usual, accusations and demands for an apology are being hurled from 
both sides.  Pundits and analysts warn of escalating tensions and 
wrecking the good start that U.S. President Barack Obama has made 
with Beijing.  Well, if generals and politicians are making a mess 
of it, at least the men on the ground, or rather the seas, showed 
remarkable restraint to avoid a potentially deadly confrontation.... 
 Certainly, Sino-U.S. ties are the most important bilateral 
relationship in the 21st century, so incidents like Sunday's tend to 
spook everyone.  But then, look on the bright side.  The navy boys 
on both sides resorted to mooning and water-spraying each other. 
That's progress in the cause of peace." 
 
¶2. Tibet 
 
"Fifty years on, time for a rethink of Tibet policy" 
 
The independent English-language South China Morning Post said in an 
editorial (3/12):  "The 50th anniversary of the failed Tibetan 
uprising has passed without the violent unrest anticipated by a 
security crackdown.  True, it was marked by the most strongly worded 
statement for years by the Dalai Lama.  The Tibetan spiritual 
leader's description of life under Chinese rule as hell on Earth 
brought an angry rebuttal from Beijing.  But his tough talk is seen 
as a gesture to radical young followers frustrated with the lack of 
progress under his policy of compromise....  Beijing needs to 
rethink its policy on Tibet, lest power passes from the Dalai Lama 
into the hands of a generation politically radicalized by the 
perception that compromise is futile.  A review would be in the 
interests of the Tibetans, the Han Chinese and ethnic minorities in 
the region.  With hindsight, Tibetans might have completely felt at 
ease being Chinese by now had Beijing's policy towards the region 
since the 1950s been guided by something similar to the one country, 
two systems model now applied to Hong Kong.  Looking ahead, if 
Beijing is to achieve its goal of social harmony and stability, 
Tibetans must be allowed a greater say in their own affairs.  For 
his part, if the Dalai Lama is serious about rapprochement, he will 
need to give up his unrealistic demand for autonomy for a so-called 
greater Tibet encompassing all Tibetan-populated areas - an idea 
that no Chinese leadership, whether communist or democratic, will 
accept." 
 
"Dalai Lama makes an empty show of strength, Tibet is at peace" 
 
The pro-PRC Chinese-language Macau Daily News remarked in an 
editorial (3/12):  "...The Dalai Group marked March 10 as the 
memorial day for the so-called 'Tibetan Uprising Day'.  They hope 
Tibetans will remember this day by stirring up trouble in March 
every year.  However, Tibet has been peaceful in the past few days. 
The reason is that Tibetans love to live in peace and the Dalai 
Group no longer has a social foundation....  Dalai Lama makes an 
empty show of strength in the international arena in an attempt to 
seek sympathy.  He serves as the pawn of the international 
anti-China powers to attack China.  Tibetan affairs are China's 
internal affairs.  The Chinese government and its people are 
resolutely against any country using the Tibetan issue to interfere 
in its internal affairs.  We would like to advise Dalai Lama to mull 
over and rectify his political stance by truly giving up his plot 
for 'Tibetan independence'.  The Central government's policy toward 
its contact with the Dalai Lama is consistent and clear.  Its door 
for communication is always open."
