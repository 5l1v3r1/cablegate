¶1. (SBU) Summary: In a March 8 meeting with Beijing Financial 
Attache David Loevinger, Treasury  DAS Robert Dohner, Asia 
Office Director Mathew Haarsager and Congenoffs, Shanghai Stock 
Exchange (SSE) Executive Vice President Liu Xiaodong (aka James 
Liu) shared his views on necessary reforms to China's capital 
markets.  Liu said the major current challenge for China's 
capital markets was how to manage the excess liquidity.  Other 
challenges included: the lack of risk management and technical 
skills of China's broker dealers, the lack of investment options 
beyond fixed income available for Qualified Domestic 
Institutional Investor (QDII) quota, and the difficulties that 
many Chinese companies had in getting their financial statements 
clean enough to apply for a public listing.  Liu agreed with 
Treasury Secretary Paulson's views (Ref A) that foreign JV 
security companies had not been successful in China, but reached 
a different conclusion - that approvals of further 
foreign-invested securities JVs should be slowed.  Liu was 
particularly disappointed that the Goldman/Gaohua JV hadn't been 
more active in promoting China listings of foreign-invested 
enterprises in China, particularly U.S. companies.  The China 
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and SSE were actively 
pursuing discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Committee (SEC) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the 
possibility of approving China Depository Receipts (CDRs) to 
allow companies listed on foreign exchanges to be traded in 
China as a possible compliment to QDIIs as a way for Chinese 
households and firms to invest in foreign companies.  Liu hoped 
the idea of CDRs could be discussed in the upcoming Strategic 
Economic Dialogue meetings in May.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Managing China's Excess Liquidity 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Liu said excess liquidity was the major challenge for 
China's capital markets, particularly as most Chinese broker 
dealers and bankers have sub-standard risk management practices. 
 Even though SSE was perhaps the best stock market in the world 
in terms of its technology, many of China's broker dealers were 
so far behind technologically that they couldn't even accept new 
accounts.  The best way to manage excess liquidity was to allow 
dollars to flow out to diversify risk and go international. 
China was moving slowly on QDII.  Liu acknowledged that CSRC 
might be moving slowly on QDII in part to avoid a negative 
impact on SSE.  He said the Shanghai Municipal Government also 
had "lots to say" on this issue.  Shanghai was not happy with 
the current situation where many PRC nationals took cash to Hong 
Kong and deposited it there. Liu wasn't happy, either; it was 
illegal, unsafe and inefficient.  It was clear CSRC was not yet 
comfortable with the ability of Chinese financial institutions 
to invest overseas since it awarded the contracts for overseas 
fund management of China's social security fund to exclusively 
to foreigners, a politically sensitive  decision.  Liu agreed 
that it probably made sense to expand the Qualified Foreign 
Institutional Investor (QFII) quota.  Even if China doubled or 
tripled the quota, it "wouldn't be a big deal." 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Liu said another problem was that many Chinese 
companies were unable to get their financial statement clean 
enough to list.  Many had problems with their land titles, 
unpaid taxes or even lacked the requisite three to five years of 
records.

Why Haven't Foreign Security JVs Worked Out as Hoped? 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Liu, like Paulson, was disappointed with the track 
record of foreign securities JVs in China.  He said it was 
easier for foreign asset management JVs to be successful in 
China.  First, their business model was simpler since they just 
dealt in secondary market listings.  Second, asset management 
companies were new, most about 2-3 years old and the oldest with 
only about a five-year history; thus they had stronger balance 
sheets.  Third, they were under strong supervision.  Finally, 
all had performed well in the 18 month-long bull market; 99 
percent had made money, no matter what they had done. 
 
¶5. (SBU) China's broker dealers were a different story.  Ninety 
percent were old companies and had been financially weakened by 
the long stock market drop and weak corporate governance.  No 
new securities companies had been formed in the last 6-7 years. 
Securities firms were also more complicated to manage since they 
were involved in a broader range of financial services.  The 
last 18 months had been an anomaly; all had done well because 
the market was skyrocketing. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Liu was particularly disappointed with Goldman's JV 
with Gaohua.  China's leaders had been watching it closely. 
They recognized that it would have higher operating costs than 
Chinese securities firms, but had expected it to be more 
successful in increasing the number of share listings in Chinese 
markets by persuading foreign-invested enterprises in China to 
list in China.  For example, Microsoft China was interested in 
listing in China, but he hadn't seen Goldman/Gaohua making a 
sales pitch.  There had been a few foreign listings, including a 
Japanese company two years ago and a Taiwan company this year. 
However, it appeared that Gaohua was more interested in chasing 
the listings of large Chinese companies, carving up slices of 
the existing pie, rather than expanding the market.  Liu 
wondered whether there was some regulatory reason Goldman wasn't 
pushing such deals, perhaps related to Sarbanes-Oxley 
provisions.  Given the unclear benefits of securities JVs, Liu 
thought the Chinese regulators should be cautious before 
approving any further JVs. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Interest in CDRs or Similar Instruments 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Liu said he had accompanied the CSRC to meet with SEC 
Chairman Christopher Cox to discuss the possibility of China 
Depository Receipts (CDRs) allowing Chinese investors to 
purchase U.S. dollar-denominated stocks on China markets.  They 
agreed to set up a dialogue to discuss the issue.  At the time, 
CDR was not on the top of China's agenda, now it was.  SSE had 
also talked to NYSE CEO John Thain two or three months ago about 
the possibility of trading NYSE-listed companies in China and 
they had set up a task force to explore.  Liu thought it was a 
good approach.  If U.S. blue chips were listed in China, it 
would help China's fund management companies and would be good 
for promoting corporate governance.  Liu hoped China would have 
a CDR or similar concept operational in 12 months and hoped the 
upcoming SED could take the issue up to speed progress.
