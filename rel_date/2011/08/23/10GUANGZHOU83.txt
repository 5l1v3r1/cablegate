¶1. (SBU) Summary: Violence erupted in a long festering land dispute 
in rural Longya Village of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region early on 
January 12, 2010, resulting in a number of arrests and 
hospitalizations for local villagers and public security officers. 
Congenoff visited the site on February 5 and saw no signs of the 
violence.  But government notices were posted on village buildings 
describing "the crime" and naming suspects who were instructed to 
turn themselves in and "confess their criminal deeds" so they could 
be "educated in accordance with law."  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Land-related protests, which often turn violent, 
are widespread in south China, frequently stemming from local 
officials colluding with property developers to pay little or no 
compensation to displaced residents.  The problem is often 
exacerbated by unrealistic expectations among local citizens about 
the compensation they can receive if they refuse initial offers and 
hold out for more.  These tensions, coupled with little effective 
government oversight or media scrutiny of local officials, as well 
as a lack of legal remedies or other dispute resolution mechanisms 
for displaceTQQT 
Uyor local officials and China's legal 
institutions can both be strengthened, these types of protests are 
likely to continue, and possibly even increase, fueled by rising 
land prices that lead both developers and local residents to see 
China's limited usable land as their ticket to prosperity.  End 
comment. 
 
Accept the Deal, Get Off the Land 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Violence erupted in the tiny rural village of Longya before 
dawn on January 12, 2010.  The story was reported in the 
Guangzhou-based newspaper Southern Metropolis Daily and by Stratfor 
Global Intelligence, an Austin, Texas-based provider of foreign 
affairs research and analysis in the company's China Security Memo. 
Both articles described how public security personnel entered the 
village at 5:00 am on January 12 to arrest several residents who had 
prevented local authorities from taking possession of disputed land 
in mid-December. 
 
¶4. (U) Violence ensued when neighbors and friends reportedly 
surrounded public security officers and refused to let them arrest 
the 12 villagers sought by local authorities.  Stratfor reported 
that the 12 individuals had been called to testify in a court 
hearing to dispute local government claims to the land.  The report 
contended that by arresting the villagers before they could appear 
in court, local officials and property developers would be granted 
final clearance to seize the land. 
 
Please, Don't Shoot! 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) All reports of the violence, including local government 
notices posted in the village, described how local residents used 
sickles, hoes and fire bombs to attack police and set a police car 
ablaze.  Outside reports also noted that police fired on a number of 
villagers, including one 37-year-old man who was hospitalized with 5 
shots to his leg and toes and another who was shot twice in the 
chest and once in the leg, although government notices conspicuously 
omitted any mention of police gun use. 
 
¶6. (U) Following the pre-dawn clash, police retreated for several 
hours before returning at noon with approximately 100 officers, 
including two heavily armed officers who reportedly traveled 100 
kilometers from Guilin city with machine guns, according to the 
press reports.  The mid-day police action concluded with numerous

additional arrests and removal of the burned out police car.  A 
journalist from Southern Metropolis Daily who visited the area a few 
days later was initially denied access and information, before 
reportedly being beaten by local thugs for investigating the story, 
which was eventually published one week after the incident. 
 
Tense Silence in Longya Village 
------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) When Congenoff visited the village February 5, there was no 
trace of the violence that took place 3 weeks earlier except for a 
few official notices posted on buildings about perpetrators.  There 
was also evidence that there might have previously been many more 
notices pasted to walls throughout the village, but now only a few 
of the original notices remained, and a new notice had been posted 
February 4 listing the names of wanted suspects.  When asked for 
information, on one in the village was rude, but residents declined 
to discuss the incident with Congenoff.  For a picture and English 
translations of the two notices please visit Guangzhou's South China
