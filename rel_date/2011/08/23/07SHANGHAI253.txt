¶1. (SBU) Stymied in its recent attempt to win approval for a New 
York to Shanghai route, Continental Airlines is considering 
starting a twice-weekly Guam to Shanghai route as early as 
October 2007, according to Continental Airlines Chief 
Representative & China Country Director H.C. Kwok.  On April 25, 
Kwok and Continental Airlines Shanghai Sales Representative 
Santino Wang met with DPO Simon Schuchat, Consular Section Chief 
and Econoff to discuss Continental's plans and inquire about 
Shanghai visa processing issues. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kwok said that Continental had reviewed market data for 
several Tier Two and Tier Three Chinese cities, such as Shenyang 
and Wuhan.  According to Kwok, the bilateral would permit them 
to immediately serve those destinations. However, it did not 
appear feasible at this time to begin daily flights between the 
United States and these secondary and tertiary markets in China. 
 Nevertheless, Continental hoped to expand its "footprint" in 
China by flying 153-passenger Boeing 737s roundtrip between Guam 
and Shanghai every Monday and Friday.  According to Kwok, 
Continental's goal was to position itself for upcoming air route 
discussions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Having checked with the General Administration of Civil 
Aviation of China (CAAC) in Beijing, Kwok understood that 
because it would not be competing with a current route flown by 
a Chinese airline, Continental should not have problems getting 
approval for its bi-weekly charter flights.  Continental uses 
Guam as its regional hub, and believed that there was sufficient 
demand from Chinese tourists to such Micronesian destinations as 
Guam, Saipan, and Palau to merit starting the route.  He 
speculated that Continental, in conjunction with hotels in Guam, 
could offer weekend packages (transportation and accommodation) 
in Guam for as little as RMB 5,000 (USD 650).  Kwok's hope was 
to establish good relationships with tourist agencies in 
Shanghai that would market Guam as an upscale alternative to 
Hainan, China and other beach resorts in the Philippines, 
Thailand and Indonesia.  Guam was a five-hour flight from 
Shanghai, Kwok said. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Kwok discussed the implications of increasing visa 
applicants by as many as 300 applicants a week should the route 
be opened.  He specifically inquired as to how Continental could 
provide information supporting the bona fides of its charters' 
passengers.  He also expressed concern over whether or not 
individual applicants might be issued a single-entry, short-term 
validity visa with restrictive annotations.  Consular Section 
Chief promised to review Kwok's concerns and meet again in the 
future should the route's opening proceed as planned. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Note: According to Consulate Foreign Commercial Service 
(FCS) Officer, in 2006, FCS set up and participated in meetings 
on behalf of the Guam Visitors Bureau and the Hawaii Tourism 
Authority with China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines to discuss 
opening routes to Guam and/or Hawaii. China Eastern has 
expressed interest in this possibility.  The Guam Airport 
Authority planned a visit to East China later this year and has 
requested FCS help in arranging meetings with airports. 
According to Guam authorities, Chinese tourists have been opting 
to travel to Saipan directly since there are expedited 
immigration procedures on direct charter flights from China. 
FCS had offered to assist Continental but they have not, so far, 
requested our assistance with routes.  Continental did, however, 
participate in the last two FCS-sponsored U.S. Pavilions at the 
World Travel Fair trade show in Shanghai.

¶6. (SBU) Note: In recent months, FCS has also met with the 
Nanjing Airport Authority and learned that they have both the 
capacity for and interest in receiving flights from the United 
States, including Hawaii and Guam.  Jiangsu Governor Liang 
Baohua told visiting Commerce U/S Frank Lavin in a March 30 
meeting that there were not yet direct flights between Nanjing 
and the United States although Singapore Airlines operated a 
profitable cargo route.  Nanjing Party Secretary Luo Zhijun 
noted interested in a direct route and said government officials 
had been in discussions with both United and Northwest Airlines, 
with the idea that a flight might initially be routed through 
Tokyo (reported septel).
