SUBJECT: VOLUNTARY VISITOR PROGRAM TO INCREASE LIBYAN TRAINING 
CAPACITY IN THE WATER SECTOR 
 
¶1.     SUMMARY: PAs tripoli requests a two-week voluntary 
visitor study tour with escort interpreter(s) in the U.S. for a 
small group of decision makers in Libya's water sector to 
introduce them to a range of U.S. government, ACADEMIC and 
professional water institutions and organizations. 
 
 
 
¶2.     BACKGROUND/justification:  The Government of Libya has 
identified water management as one of its key strategic 
priorities.  In October 2004, the U.S. and UK organized a water 
management and desalination workshop under the auspices of the 
Scientist Engagement program.  That workshop culminated in the 
development of cooperative projects to help Libya improve its 
capacity in seawater desalination, impaired water treatment, 
groundwater management, and analytical water chemistry.  In July 
2005, Libyan Secretary of the General People's Committee for 
Manpower, Training, and Employment Matug Mohamed Matug expressed 
interest in expanding U.S.-Libya cooperation in the water 
sector.  In response, USG officials held additional detailed 
discussions with Libyan water officials and experts and 
developed a joint water action plan that will guide U.S.-Libya 
water cooperation over the next 18 months.  While Libya has a 
core cadre of competent water experts, those experts have worked 
under relatively isolated conditions over the last two decades 
and need updated training in current water science and 
engineering techniques and applications.  This program is 
designed to introduce a small group (8-10 participants) of 
decision makers in Libya's water sector to a range of U.S. 
government, academic, and professional water institutions and 
organizations that would help inform the development of a Libyan 
national water training needs assessment and the establishment 
of Libyan training institutions in the water sector.  The 
program also will help expand our bilateral relationship with 
Libya by promoting further U.S.-Libya cooperation. 
 
 
 
¶3.     Overview:  Our vision for the program is a two week study 
tour that will demonstrate how the United States trains its 
professional corps of water experts.  Within the U.S., water 
training is carried out by federal, state, and local government 
agencies; public and private universities; and professional 
associations.  The Libyan participants will meet with 
representatives from these groups.  The U.S. institutions will 
explain and discuss their short-, medium-, and long-term 
training needs; and how they determine and meet those needs. 
 
 
 
¶4.     Participants:  The group should include Libyan decision 
makers and technical experts from government agencies involved 
in water training, an academic water expert, and an expert from 
a professional water association, if one exists. We will draw of
