¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Under the impetus of the General 
Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection, 
and Quarantine (AQSIQ) Party Secretary's recent 
visit to Henan Province, local officials have 
launched an interdepartmental working group to 
address the challenges of local enforcement of 
Beijing's directives on food safety.  This is part 
of a four-month nationwide campaign kicked off 
August 23.  However, as if to underscore the 
difficulties China's leaders face in this regard, 
the former Henan provincial official directly 
responsible for enforcement of food and product 
safety regulation was recently stripped of his NPC 
credentials under suspicion of accepting bribes. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Director General of Henan Province's 
Foreign Affairs Office told visiting Econ M/C and 
Econoff during an August 26-28 trip to Henan that 
the province has recently launched a campaign to 
address the food safety issue in response to 
pressure from Beijing.  He opined that the Province 
had the means to cope with any deficiencies in 
enforcement.  Local officials have organized an 
inter-departmental working group to mirror the 
leading group set up in the State Council under 
Vice-Premier Wu Yi.  According to Henan officials, 
this effort was in response to a visit paid to the 
province by General Administration for Quality 
Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) 
Party Secretary Li Chuanqing on August 24.  Henan 
officials note that at least one of the top three 
officials of AQSIQ, including Party Secretary Li, 
Minister Li Changjiang, and a third unspecified 
official intends to visit every province in China to 
drive home the message of the importance of this 
issue.  During his trip to Henan, AQSIQ Party 
Secretary Li held meetings attended also by Henan 
 
SIPDIS 
Governor Li Chengyu to spread the word to provincial, 
municipal and county-level officials.  This national 
campaign is set to run for four months, Henan 
officials told us. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As if to underscore the difficulty of 
enforcing food and product safety regulations at the 
local level, the Beijing Wanbao on August 31 
reported that China's National People's Congress had 
stripped former Director of Henan Province's 
Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau (CIQ) 
Bao Jianmin (CIQ is the provincial level equivalent 
of AQSIQ) of his credentials for the 10th NPC Standing 
Committee on the grounds that he was suspected of 
taking bribes.  Media accounts from Xinhua and 
other sources dated August 4 report that the 
provincial People's Congress was considering 
recommending that Bao be removed from 
the NPC Standing Committee as he was suspected of 
receiving bribes and payoffs both during his tenure 
as CIQ director and during his tenure in previous 
posts.  The amounts dating from 1997-2006 were 
estimated to have been 483,000 RMB and 80,000 USD. 
The article said Bao, in return, provided certain 
 
BEIJING 00005797  002 OF 002 
 
 
benefits to those who paid the bribes.  Bao was 
also reported to have accepted large additional 
gifts and to have accumulated suspiciously large 
personal wealth which was also the subject of 
investigation.  The media accounts also noted that 
Henan CIQ Deputy Director Chen Xuesheng had been 
convicted of accepting 240,000 RMB in bribes, 
the standard sentence for which, if convicted, 
is six years in prison. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment. Henan FAO officials said the 
recent visit of the AQSIQ Party Secretary had no 
connection to the bribery case details of which they 
say surfaced in the April/May time-frame.  They note 
that every province is receiving a similar visit. 
Even if true, the case does indicate the daunting 
problems China faces in ensuring local officials 
implement Beijing's directives.
