Â¶1. (SBU) In a March 18 meeting between Assistant 
United States Trade Representative Tim Stratford and 
Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) WTO Director General 
Zhang Xiangchen, DG Zhang referenced the February 15 
meeting with Econ Minister Counselor Robert Luke and 
EU Counselor for Trade and Investment Olivier Micol on 
the United States/EU labeling for textile, apparel, 
footwear, and travel (TAFT) goods proposal before the 
WTO (Ref A).  DG Zhang said that, following the 
February 15 meeting, he had internal discussions with 
the relevant Chinese line ministries.  Based on those 
discussions, Zhang reported that China is inclined to 
co-sponsor the United States/EU proposal as long as a 
few specific concerns can be addressed.  Zhang said 
that Chinese negotiators in Geneva would be contacting 
United States and EU delegations in Switzerland to 
discuss those concerns.
