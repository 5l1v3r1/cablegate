  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "U.S. and China enter a new era of balance" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/12): "In the 21st century, the balance and 
strength of the U.S.-China relationship has gradually been built. In 
the past two centuries, China's national strength was not at the 
same level as that of the U.S. Thus there is a great imbalance in 
ideology between the U.S. and China. However, during this century 
the situation changed. Currently the two countries' economies are 
nearing and becoming balanced. More and more dialogues are equal. 
This balancing is not based on the terror of the cold war, but on 
the cooperation of the two countries. Future win-win situations will 
be the foundation of the two countries relations. However, this 
balancing is a subsidiary of the general bilateral relationship. The 
two should make an effort to continue to balance their 
relationship." 
 
b. "The U.S.- China relationship deserves more brainstorming by the 
Chinese" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(01/12): "In the 
U.S., the Chinese promotion of the U.S.-China relationship is rarely 
seen. U.S. experts have brought new concepts forward such as 
Chimerica, the U.S.-China Strategic Alliance, the visit to China by 
future President Obama, etc. In China, there are different opinions 
about these new concepts for the future U.S.-China relations. All 
the concepts have common backgrounds: first, they've arisen in a 
U.S. presidential election year; second, they were brought forward 
during the financial crisis; third, they were mentioned in relation 
to the 30th anniversary of U.S.-China relations. Looking at the 
concepts, China should regularly consider them. What's more, China 
should embrace the concepts optimistically and openly. Furthermore, 
China should have a sober awareness of its real strength, and the 
distance between the U.S.' strength and China's position in the 
current international system. It is time for the Chinese to bring 
some new ideas in order to further the U.S.-China relationship." 
 
¶2. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"It goes against common sense to speak for the American cheaters" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/12): "Americans are the most skilled and 
frivolous people in the world, they not only spend their own money, 
but they spend others' money, which they've borrowed. Finally, they 
have reconciled to the financial crisis. Both Wall Street and the 
U.S. have lost global credit. However, certain officials, including 
Paulson and Bernanke, do not feel guilty for causing the crisis. 
They have blamed others for the crisis. They do not criticize Wall 
Street for mismanaging their money and cheating, but they criticize 
those who lent the money to Wall Street. They are speaking for the 
cheaters. The break out of the financial crisis is the collapse of a 
fictitious economy. If Paulson says that the reason is the Chinese 
people's high deposit rate, and that it is their fault because the 
Chinese have lent money to the U.S., then where is the common sense 
in the world?" 
 
¶3. ISRAEL 
 
"'Cast Lead' influences the Middle East's strategic situation" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao) (01/12): "Analysts think that the imbalanced confrontation 
between Israel and Hamas and Israel's hegemony in this crisis brings 
spiritual harm to the regional and Arab countries. The 'cast lead' 
conflict will go beyond Hamas and Israel and will ignite a new round 
of arms races in the Middle East. It is not a good sign for both the 
region and the world. Last year Israel had a negation with Syria to 
destroy the alliance of Syria, Iran, Lebanon and Hamas. But it will 
be impossible for Syria to have a peaceful negotiation with Israel 
after the 'cast lead' conflict. Turkey is being complimented by the 
Arab media for their stance in the conflict. This conflict will 
influence the relationship of the Arab and Western countries, the 
relationships between the Arab and regional countries, the relations 
within the Arab countries and, the relationship between the Arab 
countries and Israel."
