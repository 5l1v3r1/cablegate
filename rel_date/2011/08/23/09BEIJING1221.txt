  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA MILITARY RELATIONS 
 
"U.S. and China deal with naval confrontation in the Yellow Sea 
quietly" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(05/07): "Yesterday, the U.S. media reported 
the confrontation between the U.S. and China in the Yellow Sea. 
However, they didn't mention the American ship's military goal and 
potential threat to China.  The article described the U.S. as the 
victim.  Since 2001, U.S.-China relations have tightened because the 
U.S. continues to approach China to conduct illegal inspections. 
96% of Chinese netizens have expressed their support that the 
behavior of the Chinese fishermen, they drove away the American 
investigation ship, was appropriate.  The Chinese request that the 
Americans adopt measures that avoid having similar occurrences in 
the future.  Chinese experts pointed out that the surveillance 
activities of the American ship in the coastal areas of Eastern 
China, Southern China and Nansha archipelago have become more 
frequent in recent years.  However, Chinese scholars do not 
understand why as of yet.  It is possible that it was the private 
behavior of the Chinese fishermen; they might worry that the actions 
of the American survey ship may destroy oceanic resources.  The 
intentional exaggeration by the U.S., which made the world think 
that their reaction was an organized behavior by China, indicates 
that the Americans either don't know about the situation, or hold 
ulterior motives.  These things will continue to happen.  The U.S. 
military's steps do not match the U.S. government's steps. 
Sometimes, they compete with each other on policies.  Historically, 
spying by the U.S. on other countries has encountered opposition." 
 
¶2. CHINA THREAT 
 
"American and Japanese senior officials should watch their mouths" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(05/07): "Mike Mullen, Chairman of Joint 
Chiefs of Staff has publicly claimed that China's increased Navy and 
Air force military strength is focused on the U.S. At the same time, 
the Japanese Prime Minister expressed that he thought the recent 
activities by China and North Korea have threatened Asia's security. 
Currently, U.S. and Japanese opinions concerning China are 
complicated and extreme. The exaggerated comments about China by 
these two men will surely bring negativity to the U.S. and Japanese 
relationship with China. It sends the wrong signals to China and the 
world.  It will disturb the U.S. and Japanese strategies on China 
and also influence the Chinese military's correct and objective 
conclusion on the policies of the U.S. and Japan. Without calm 
judgment and a broad overview of the situation by senior leaders, 
the whole world will be impacted.  As a country's senior official, 
one should restrain his own opinion and not mix it with policies. 
They should better watch their mouths, especially while in the 
public eye, and not express comments that are opposite their 
countries' established policies.  China should ask for clarification 
and Mullen and Taro Aso should take responsibility."
