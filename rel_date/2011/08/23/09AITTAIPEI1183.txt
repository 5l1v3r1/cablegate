Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage September 30 on the Taiwan government's plan to ease its 
restrictions on local semiconductor and LCD companies investing in 
China; on the 2009 U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference currently 
held in Virginia; and on China's celebrations of its upcoming 60th 
anniversary.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial 
in the pro-independence "Liberty Times" discussed China's 
celebrations of its 60th anniversary and what it believes to be the 
Ma Ying-jeou administration's tilting toward China.  The article 
cited the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1952 and concluded that 
Taiwan does not belong to the Republic of China (ROC), and as a 
result, the island will become part of China even if the ROC on 
Taiwan surrenders itself to the People's Republic of China in the 
future.  An editorial in the mass-circulation "Apple Daily" urged 
the Taiwan government not to forget that China remains to a key 
threat to Taiwan's national security.  End summary. 
 
A) "Two Psychological Portrayals, One Big Pitfall" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 680,000] 
editorialized (9/30): 
 
"... In other words, given the actions taken in the wake of World 
War II, the international treaties signed between the victorious and 
defeated nations only stated that Japan had renounced [its claim 
over] Taiwan; they did not specify which country Taiwan belonged to. 
 According to the principles of international law, Taiwan's 
sovereignty naturally belongs to the people of Taiwan.  As a result, 
it is evidently nonsensical talk when the People's Republic of China 
(PRC) claims that Taiwan is part of China, or when the Republic of 
China (ROC) claims that Taiwan was returned to the ROC. 
 
"In this vein, the significance of the 60th anniversary of the PRC 
for the Taiwan people is:  Taiwan has yet to break away from the 
occupation of the ROC, and that the ROC has 'never possessed the 
sovereignty' [of Taiwan].  ...  Based on the aforementioned logic, 
there are only some unresolved issues between Taiwan and the ROC; 
even if the ROC on Taiwan surrenders itself to the PRC in the 
future, Taiwan will not become part of China!  The Ma administration 
has said more than once that they will not sell out Taiwan.  In 
reality, however, it is not that they will not sell out Taiwan, but 
that they do not have the right to sell out Taiwan.  Taiwan's 
sovereignty does not belong to the ROC, so how is the Ma 
administration going to sell out Taiwan?  Nonetheless, judging from 
the policy of the Ma administration, [Ma] is interested in working 
with Beijing to jointly annex Taiwan -- namely, the ROC and the PRC 
will decide privately how they are going to deal with Taiwan, and 
eventually Taiwan will become a thing in China's bag. ..." 
 
B) "Friend or Foe?" 
 
The mass-circulation "Apple Daily" [circulation: 520,000] 
editorialized (9/30): 
 
"In its briefing to the Legislative Yuan today, the Ministry of 
Defense said China has been rapidly strengthening its modern armed 
forces; China's hostility against Taiwan persists, and China remains 
the key threat to Taiwan's national security. ...  China's essence 
of being fascist is evident, as shown by the parade it will be 
holding on October 1 in celebration of its National Day. ...  Except 
for Pyongyang and Beijing, few countries in the world like to review 
their troops any more in this way of showing off. ...  The Ministry 
of Defense was being polite in saying that China is a threat to 
Taiwan.  We hope that the national security team will have the same 
understanding and will not forget to stand on their toes while 
seeking to improve Taiwan's relations with China."
