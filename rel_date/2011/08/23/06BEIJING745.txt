MINISTER CAO GANGCHUAN 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In a meeting with Chinese Defense Minister 
Cao Gangchuan, Representative Kirk outlined three 
proposals for U.S.-China military and space 
cooperation: a DOD-MND hotline, an International Space 
Station-compatible docking ring for China's Shenzhou 
spacecraft and increased transparency in China's 
manned spaceflight program.  Cao reviewed U.S.-China 
cooperation and gave positive support to the space 
cooperation proposals but was noncommittal on a 
defense hotline link.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At a cordial meeting January 10, 
Representatives Mark Kirk, Rick Larsen and Tom Feeney 
as members of the U.S.-China Working Group of the 
House of Representatives met with Defense Minister Cao 
Gangchuan at the Chinese Ministry of National Defense 
(MND).  Cao warmly welcomed the group, noting that the 
delegation's itinerary would include the launch 
facilities for China's manned spaceflight program, 
which foreigners rarely see. This indicates the great 
importance China attaches to the visit of the Working 
Group. 
 
Proposals for Enhanced Cooperation 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Representative Kirk outlined three specific 
proposals for improved U.S.-China relations.  The 
first is a U.S. Defense Department-PRC Ministry of 
National Defense Direct Telephone Link (DTL).  The two 
militaries seem ready for this step and the United 
States and China already have a presidential DTL 
between the White House and President Hu Jintao's 
office; and between the U.S. Department of State and 
the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  It is 
important for military professionals to be able to 
talk to each other and complement the links between 
national and foreign policy leaders. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The second proposal, Representative Kirk 
continued, is a docking ring for China's Shenzhou 
spacecraft compatible with the International Space 
Station (ISS) to facilitate a decision by China to 
participate in the Station.  Additionally, the 
American and Chinese people would welcome the ability 
of the Shenzhou spacecraft to assist with an ISS 
rescue mission, should the need arise. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The third proposal is for increased 
transparency in China's manned spaceflight program. 
Increased transparency would build confidence between 
the two countries' space administrations. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Working Group hopes to see concrete 
progress on these issues before the visit of President 
Hu Jintao to the United States in April.  The Working 
Group appreciates General Cao's help with these issues 
in the months ahead. 
 
Cao: Cherish "Hard-Won" U.S.-China Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Cao expressed his thanks and careful 
attention to the Working Group's issues.  At present, 
U.S.-China relations are stable and have reached broad 
consensus on cooperation in the 21st Century.  In 
addition to trade ties, more than one million citizens 
travel between the two countries annually.  Bilateral 
cooperation includes seeking a nuclear-free Korean 
Peninsula, U.N. reform, counterterrorism, 
nonproliferation and anticrime measures. The 
significance of U.S.-China ties has increased and good 
relations are a "hard-won" development to be 
cherished. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Cao said he has thought deeply on U.S.-China 
issues.  The world contains 189 countries and 
thousands of ethnic groups, cultures, traditions, 
 
BEIJING 00000745  002 OF 003 
 
 
political systems and religions. In such a diverse 
world, it is impossible to have identical views. 
Nevertheless, in U.S.-China relations the 
commonalities are greater than the differences. 
 
Mil-Mil Ties and Rumsfeld's "Charisma of a Sailor" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Turning to military-to-military relations, 
Cao took note of his 2003 visit to Washington and 
Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's visit to Beijing in 2005. 
Cao characterized Rumsfeld's visit as a great success, 
as consensus was reached on military exchanges and 
increased cooperation. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Cao said his discussions with Secretary 
Rumsfeld in October were open and frank and that he 
got along very well with Rumsfeld because of their 
closeness in age.  Rumsfeld has "the charisma of a 
sailor" and talks about military issues "above board," 
with respect and understanding.  China's defense 
modernization is part of China's economic development 
drive and should not be considered a threat, Cao 
stated.  China suffered foreign invasions for more 
than one hundred years, so the Chinese people know 
from experience to "Do not to others what you do not 
want others to do to you." 
 
Cao's Views on Working Group Ideas 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Pressed by Representative Kirk for a 
response to the three ideas proposed by the Working 
Group, Cao said that he would ask the professionals to 
have discussions on an ISS-compatible docking ring for 
the Shenzhou spacecraft.  Cao supported further 
discussions on China's manned spaceflight program to 
increase transparency.  He added that although past 
U.S.-Chinese satellite cooperation was halted by the 
American fear of technology transfer, he would take a 
positive attitude to this proposal. 
 
¶12.  (SBU) Regarding a DTL link between the two 
defense establishments, Cao claimed that China's MND 
has never established such a link with a foreign 
military.  Foreign military contacts are handled by 
the Foreign Affairs Office of the MND with the U.S. 
Embassy DAO office and through the Chinese Embassy in 
Washington.  If MND were to establish a DTL with a 
foreign defense department, the first country for such 
a defense hotline would be the United States. 
 
¶13.  (SBU) Representative Kirk asked Cao to inform him 
of future MND delegations visiting Washington and said 
he would raise the DTL issue with Secretary Rumsfeld 
and DUSD Richard Lawless.
