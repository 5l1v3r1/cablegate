¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed the 
second avian influenza death in China in 2008.  The case, an 
unemployed 41 year-old male, died on Feb. 20 in Guangxi Province. 
Although the MOH report indicated that the patient had been in 
contact with infected poultry before contracting the disease, the 
Chinese authorities have not reported any new avian outbreaks of 
influenza in the Guangxi area.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On Feb. 22, the Ministry of Health transmitted a fax to 
the Embassy to report an avian influenza (H5N1) case in Guangxi 
Province.  The case, an unemployed 41 year-old male from Nanning, 
the capital of Guangxi, was hospitalized on Feb. 12 and died on Feb. 
¶20.  After tests confirmed that the patient had died of avian 
influenza, a local investigation revealed that he had recently been 
in contact with sick poultry.  On Feb. 21, laboratories of the China 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the earlier 
diagnosis and determined that the patient died of highly pathogenic 
avian influenza.  Recent contacts of the patient have been placed 
under strict medical observation.  To date, none have exhibited 
symptoms of the disease. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Although the local authorities indicated that the patient 
had recent contact with infected poultry, the Chinese Government has 
not reported any new avian cases in the Guangxi area.  The last 
reported outbreak among poultry was in Tibet on Feb. 17 (see ref B). 
 China has reported 29 cases of human avian influenza infection 
since 2003, with 19 deaths.
