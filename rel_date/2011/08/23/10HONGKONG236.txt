TRANSSHIPMENT AND LOGISTIC 
 
REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated December 15,2010 (01210100) 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) attempted 
to conduct a post shipment verification (PSV) at Chu Kong 
Transshipment and Logistic Co., 1/F, 97 Ho Yeung St., Tuen Mun, 
N.T., Hong Kong (Chu Kong). The item in question for this PSV is 
flexible silicone rubber transmission line absorber exported to Chu 
Kong on or about June 8, 2009.  According to the exporter, this item 
is classified under ECCN 1C001 and if properly classified, would 
require a license to both Hong Kong and China for national security 
(NS) and missile technology (MT) reasons.  The exporter was Cuming 
Microwave Corporation of Avon, Massachusetts. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Chu Kong has been 
in existence since 1989. It is a freight forwarding company 
(www.cksd.com).  Documentation provided by OEA reveals that the 
likely end user for this item is Mitac Computer (Shunde) Ltd., in 
Shunde, mainland China.  Mitac is an IT company that produces 
various wireless and enterprise solutions products (www.mitac.com). 
It has a range of worldwide offices including some in the United 
States. 
 
¶4.  FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan attempted, on several 
occasions, to arrange a meeting with Chu Kong.  Mr. Xu, Wang, 
Logistic Department Manager, declined to meet with the ECO unless 
ECO was accompanied by Hong Kong Government officials.  He stated 
that Chu Kong is a freight forwarder and had forwarded the item in 
question to Shunde.  Ms. Xu stated that ECO should reach out to 
Mitac for additional information. 
 
¶5.  As it is clear that the item in question has been shipped to 
mainland China, ECO recommends that OEA request an official 
commodity classification for this item.  ECO would not be surprised 
if the exporter has over-classified the item.  Should the item be 
subject to control under ECCN 1C001, ECO will reach out to the Hong 
Kong government to assist in follow-up with Chu Kong.  At OEA's 
request, ECO may reach out to the Hong Kong government regarding Chu 
Kong's unwillingness to meet irrespective of the final ECCN (ECO 
does not recommend such an approach).
