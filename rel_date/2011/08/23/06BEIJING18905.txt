A/S Hill Visit, Six Party Talks 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  A/S Hill's meetings with VFM Wu Dawei and AFM Cui Tiankai 
focused on how to break the impasse and resume the Six-Party 
Talks, MFA Spokesperson Qin Gang said at the September 7 
regular press briefing.  Responding to repeated questioning 
on the purpose of A/S Hill's September 5-6 visit to Beijing, 
Qin reaffirmed Beijing's commitment to the Six-Party Talks 
process as the most pragmatic and effective mechanism to 
achieve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. 
 
¶3.  Questioned about UN Resolution 1695, Qin stated that 1695 
supports both the "peaceful" solution to the North Korean 
issue. China continues to oppose economic sanctions on the 
DPRK.  Qin said Beijing will provide "a certain amount" of 
assistance to the North Korean flood zone, but did not 
specify the amount. 
 
DPRK Nuclear Test, Kim Jong-Il Visit Rumors 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  When asked about reports the DPRK will soon conduct a 
nuclear test, Qin said Beijing reaffirms its position that 
all parties should remain calm, exercise restraint, show 
flexibility and avoid taking actions that would escalate the 
dispute. 
 
¶5.  Questioned several times whether Kim Jong Il, or other 
high-level DPRK officials were currently in China, Qin 
remained evasive.  Beijing and Pyongyang share a traditional 
friendship and have many exchanges at all levels, Qin said. 
Beijing has taken note of the reports and will inform the 
public "at the appropriate time" of any such visits, he 
stated. 
 
Lebanon Resolution 
------------------ 
 
¶6.  Despite the adoption of UNSC resolution 1701, the 
ceasefire in Lebanon is still fragile, Qin said.  The urgent 
task is to strengthen and quickly deploy the UN peace keeping 
mission, he stated.  China will maintain its engineering 
corps and is studying whether to increase its troop 
commitments to the region, he added.

Iranian Nuclear Issue 
--------------------- 
 
¶7.  China advocates peaceful resolution of the Iranian 
nuclear issue through negotiation and dialogue, Qin answered 
when asked about Russia's possible agreement with the U.S. 
Statement on Iran. 
 
CIA Jails and GITMO Detainees 
----------------------------- 
 
¶8.  China has taken note of the international concern over 
the CIA's reported use of secret detention facilities, Qin 
said.  China firmly opposes international terrorism but 
believes that the UN Charter and international law should be 
followed, he said.  China and the United States enjoy good 
anti-terrorism cooperation and communication, he added. 
Pressed for further details on whether Chinese nationals are 
detained in CIA facilities, Qin said that China "requires" 
the United States to repatriate any Chinese detained at GITMO. 
 
Sino-Zambian Relations 
---------------------- 
 
¶9.  Qin denied that China would cut diplomatic ties with 
Zambia should Zambian opposition leader Michael Sata win the 
presidency.  Qin also denied that Chinese firms will suspend 
investment in the country.  China and Zambia enjoy friendly 
relations and the Zambian government adheres to the one-China 
policy, Qin stated, when asked about Sata's comments that 
Taiwan was a "sovereign state."  Asked about working 
conditions in Chinese-run factories in Zambia, Qin stated 
that Chinese businesses operated according to law and had a 
positive and conducive role in the livelihoods of many 
Zambians. 
 
WHO nomination 
-------------- 
 
¶10.  Qin affirmed Beijing's support for the nomination of 
Margaret Chan as Director General of the World Health 
Organization, responding that her considerable experience, 
qualifications and achievements make her an excellent 
candidate for the position. 
 
Genetically Modified Rice 
------------------------- 
 
¶11.  China has taken note of a report suggesting the EU might 
ban genetically modified Chinese rice, Qin said.  All such 
agricultural experiments are conducted according to the law, 
he said.  To date, no genetically modified rice is being 
produced for commercial consumption, he added. 
 
Visits 
------ 
¶12.  VM in charge of Latin America Yang Jiechi will attend 
the 14th Summit of the Non-Alignment Movement in Havana, Cuba 
September 15-16.
