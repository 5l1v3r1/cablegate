  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S. POLICY 
 
a. "American supervision only considers white people" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/11): "The recent crash of a tour bus has 
directed all of the blame on travel agencies operated by Chinese 
Americans.  However why weren't these travel agencies' flaws been 
picked up by the American government which has a reputation for good 
management?  It has revealed an 'invisible rule' in American 
management which is that the government's responsibilities are 
limited and the government mainly protects the interests of American 
citizens, especially white people. After the crash happened, no 
officials from American government have claimed responsibility for 
it or apologized. In the place where market rules don't work like 
social security, smuggling, the American government conducts active 
management; while in areas where the market rules, like tourism and 
entertainment, it conducts negative management. American government 
often turned a blind eye to organizations whose customers are mainly 
non-white citizens and communities. Thus some unqualified dealers 
can operate under such invisible rules. It shows the U.S. society 
operates with the invisible rules of diving people by their races. 
The U.S. has just realized human rights and equality in certain 
aspects, not in all." 
 
b. "Obama is aggressive at his first press conference" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/11): "Unlike the mild attitude he has 
shown for his first three weeks, Obama was very aggressive, sincere 
and gloomy in his first press conference.  He has shown great 
changes on foreign policy from the Bush administration.  He has 
shown a strong willingness to normalize reQtions with Iran and 
advocated joint non-proliferation programs with Russia. American 
vice President Biden has expressed it is time to press on the reset 
button when dealing with relations with Russia. Western media 
indicates that resuming the relations is not easy. If the U.S. 
supports NATO's expansion, the U.S.-Russia relations will be at 
confrontation again." 
 
¶3. CHINA'S ROLE 
 
"China needs to participate in the reconstruction of the global 
values system" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/11): "The world has focused its attention 
on China due to the current financial crisis.  The world is facing a 
reconstruction of the economic and political order and its system of 
values as well.  China's model has started to impose substantial 
influence on human history. It is China's cultural responsibilities 
as a rising country to construct the globally-applied values in the 
stance of China. The growing national strength of China has gained 
our generation the rights to construct such globally-applied value. 
The current issue for China is not whether or not to participate in 
the reconstruction of the global value system, but how to 
participate. China should possess the knowledge power, morality and 
courage provided by the era to answer the question of 
globally-applied values."
