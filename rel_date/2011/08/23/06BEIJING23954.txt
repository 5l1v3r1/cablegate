A/S Hill Discusses DPRK With VFM Wu Dawei 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  MFA Spokesperson Jiang Yu said EAP A/S Christopher Hill 
and Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei had an in-depth exchange 
of views regarding the Six-Party Talks and agreed to continue 
efforts to promote early resumption and progress of the 
Talks.  Jiang denied that a date had already been set for the 
nex round of Talks, saying further consultation wa 
necessary.  Jiang deflected questions about possible travel 
by VFM Wu to Pyongyang or by DPRK FM Kim Gye-gwan to Beijing. 
 
 
Reports On "Unfrozen" DPRK Bank Accounts 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Jiang said she had no official information about reports 
that North Korean accounts at the Banco Delta Asia in Macao 
were unfrozen.  Jiang noted that recent media reports said 
previous claims about unfreezing of such accounts are 
inaccurate.  The Macao SAR government is currently 
investigating and has jurisdiction over this matter, she 
said. 
 
Journalist Arrested in Guangdong 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Responding to reports about the arrest of a United 
States' journalist in Guangdong Province, Jiang said 
reporters should ask the relevant provincial officials for 
details.  The MFA works to facilitate the work of foreign 
journalists in China and hopes they abide by local laws, said 
Jiang. 
 
Hu's visit to India, Civilian Nuclear Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶5.  Jiang said that President Hu's visit to India sends a 
signal to the international community that both countries are 
serious about deepening their friendship and Strategic 
Cooperative Partnership.  Trade and cooperation are a 
dynamic, mutually beneficial part of the China-India 
relationship, she said, and China hopes the Indian government 
will maintain a long-term, strategic perspective.  In 
response to reports that China and India will sign civilian 
nuclear agreements during the visit, Jiang replied that China 
is willing to conduct peaceful nuclear cooperation where all 
parties abide by their international commitments. 
 
India's "Positive Gestures" Include Tibet 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Jiang said Beijing appreciated India's proclamation 
during Hu's visit that Tibet is part of China and hopes India 
will honor its commitments in that regard.  The statement 
came in response to an Indian journalist's question regarding 
three friendly gestures India has made during the visit, 
pledging not to discriminate against Chinese foreign direct 
investment, not to restrict visas for Chinese business 
travelers and publicly proclaiming that Tibet is a part of 
China.  Tibet is an internal PRC matter, Jiang said and China 
protects the religious rights of its citizens.

DPRK BANK ACCOUNTS IN MACAO, JOURNALIST'S ARREST, 
CHINA-INDIA RELATIONS, MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL DISPUTE, EU BAN 
ON DOG AND CAT FUR, VISITS BY MONGOLIAN PRESIDENT, 
COLOMBIAN VICE PRESIDENT 
 
 
Security Cooperation with Pakistan and India 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Asked whether China will seek to further security 
cooperation with India and Pakistan during Hu's visits to 
those countries, Jiang said that China and its neighbors have 
made progress in regional security cooperation, especially 
since the increased focus on anti-terrorism.  China looks to 
step up counter-terrorism and security cooperation.  A 
reporter asked about Chinese plans to divert water that flows 
into India out of a river originating in Tibet, but Jiang had 
no information on the topic. 
 
Mexican Presidential Dispute 
---------------------------- 
 
¶8.  The MFA is paying attention to reports on the political 
situation in Mexico, after previously defeated presidential 
candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore himself in as 
President of a parallel government on Monday.  Jiang added 
that China considers Mexico a friendly nation and hopes the 
country can maintain stability throughout the dispute. 
 
Protection of Wildlife and Animals 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  Responding to a question about a proposed European Union 
ban on importing cat and dog fur, Jiang said China has strict 
regulations on the export and trade of wild animals and has 
"good and sound international cooperation in this regard." 
Jiang said the torture and cruel killing of cats and dogs is 
by no means a universal phenomenon in China, noting the 
increasing awareness of animal protection in China and the 
great importance China attaches to issues of wildlife 
protection. 
 
Colombian Vice-President Santos' Visit 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  Vice-President Francisco Santos Calderon of Colombia 
will hold meetings with Vice-Premier Zeng Qinghong and with 
Premier Wen Jiabao on November 21 and 22.  Colombia and China 
have had friendly relations since establishing diplomatic 
ties in 1980 and will continue to deepen exchange in 
political, economic and cultural fields, said Jiang. 
 
Mongolian PM Enkhbold To Meet Wen Jiabao 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  In response to questions, Jiang said that Mongolian PM 
Enkhbold will meet with PM Wen Jiabao on November 21 and with 
NPC Chair Wu Bangguo and Politburo member Jia Qingling on 
November 22.  She did not mention that any agreements that 
will be signed during the November 19-26 visit.  China 
believes the visit will further bilateral relations, increase 
trade and deepen trust following the 2003 signing of the 
Partnership of Good Neighborliness and Mutual Trust.
