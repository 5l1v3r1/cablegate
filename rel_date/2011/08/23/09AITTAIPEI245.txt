SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: PRESIDENT OBAMA'S APPOINTMENT OF CHARLES 
FREEMAN 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage March 6 on the Ministry of Economic Affairs' plan to 
salvage Taiwan's DRAM industry; on Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's work 
report in China's National People's Congress (NPC); and on the 
situation of the local economy.  In terms of editorials and 
commentaries, an editorial in the conservative, pro-unification, 
English-language "China Post" commented on Washington's announcement 
last week of Charles W. Freeman, Jr., to be the Chairman of the 
United States National Intelligence Council.  The editorial 
disagreed with widespread criticism of Freeman's suitability for the 
position.  Instead, the editorial said by having Freeman, a fluent 
Mandarin Chinese speaker familiar with Taiwan and China, 
cross-Strait issues will not be "put on the back burner" when the 
United States is preoccupied with many other issues.  End summary. 
 
 
"Freeman A Good Choice" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language "China Post" 
[circulation: 30,000] editorialized (3/6): 
 
"Last week, Washington announced that veteran U.S. diplomat Charles 
Â¶W. Freeman, Jr., was chosen to become the next chairman of U.S. 
President Barack Obama's National Intelligence Council.  The 
appointment, made by Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair, 
has prompted widespread criticism because of Freeman's vast contacts 
with foreign governments.  Known by his nickname 'Chas,' Freeman has 
formerly served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia and special envoy 
to Beijing. ... 
 
"Freeman's appointment is controversial, because he will gain access 
to the most sensitive intelligence secrets. ... 
 
"Many people in Taiwan remember Freeman because he served a stint at 
the U.S. embassy in Taipei in the 1960s when he was working for the 
U.S. Foreign Service, and headed the Republic of China Desk at the 
U.S. State Department in the 1970s before diplomatic relations were 
cut. ... 
 
"Freeman is a fluent speaker of Mandarin Chinese and served as 
Richard Nixon's personal translator during the former U.S. 
president's history-making trip to mainland China in 1972.  At 
times, Freeman has expressed views sharply critical of our 
government, such as when he blamed Taiwan for causing much of the 
tension in the Taiwan Strait. ... 
 
"In practice, Freeman will just be coordinating between different 
government agencies in hopes of improving the quality of 
intelligence presented to President Obama.  In the end, it will be 
President Obama, and not Freeman, who makes important decisions 
about what actions to take based upon this intelligence.  We are 
pleased to see someone like Freeman, who speaks Chinese and is 
highly familiar with this region, serving in such an important post. 
 This means that while Washington remains preoccupied with its war 
against terrorism, Iraq and Afghanistan, events in this region will 
not be put on the back burner. ..."
