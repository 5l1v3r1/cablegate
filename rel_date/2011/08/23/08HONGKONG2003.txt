SUBJECT: Hang Seng Rockets Up 13 percent. 
 
¶1.  Following a moderate gain of 0.84 percent on Wednesday, the Hang 
Seng Index jumped almost 13 percent on Thursday, to finish up 1628 
points at 14,329, up 12.82 percent.  The Federal Reserves 50 basis 
point cut helped, but had been widely expected.  The Chinese Central 
Bank announcement that it would also cut its benchmark rates by 27 
basis points undoubtedly helped Chinese stocks, but remarks by 
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao suggesting China would make "all out 
efforts" to support Hong Kong's economy were the real market driver. 
 
 
¶2.  Wen promised to work with Hong Kong financial regulators on 
contingency plans to handle risks; fast-track infrastructure 
projects, including the HK-Macau-Zhuhai bridge project; guarantee 
stable food supplies to Hong Kong; provide support for Hong 
Kong-based SME's with operations in China; and extend the individual 
traveler scheme to additional Chinese cities so Chinese tourists 
will find it easier to come to Hong Kong. 
 
¶3. Interbank liquidity loosened considerably for all tenures.  HIBOR 
on Thursday, October 30 was 0.7 for over night, up slightly from 
down from 0.5 percent on Wednesday; 1. percent for one week, 
unchanged; 2 percent for two weeks, unchanged from Wednesday; 2.45 
percent for one month, down from 3.05 percent; 3 percent for two 
months, down from 3.3 percent; 3.4 percent for three and six month 
borrowing, down from 3.6 percent; 12 month loans dropped to 3.45 
percent, also from 3.6 percent on Wednesday.
