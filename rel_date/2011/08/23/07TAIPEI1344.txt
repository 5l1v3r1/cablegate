REF: STATE 78365 
 
¶1.  The Acting Deputy Director (ADDIR) delivered the 2007 TIP 
Report Taiwan narrative and demarche to Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MOFA) Deputy Director General of North American 
Affairs Christine M.Y Hsueh on June 12. Hsueh was accompanied 
by National Immigration Agency (NIA), Director of Immigration 
Affairs Chien Hui-Juan.  Per reftel instructions, ADDIR noted 
that Taiwan had been removed from the Tier 2 Watch List in 
light of Taiwan's clear progress over the past year in 
addressing its sex and labor trafficking problem.  However, 
because Taiwan does not fully comply with the minimum 
standards to eliminate trafficking, Taiwan will remain on 
Tier 2.  ADDIR urged the Taiwan authorities to improve 
protections for victims of trafficking, to better protect 
laborers from forced deportation by labor brokers, and to 
punish labor trafficking offenses with criminal, not 
administrative, penalties.  ADDIR commended Taiwan's recent 
success in disrupting several human trafficking rings, and 
the decision to house trafficking victims in NGO shelters, 
not detention facilities.  ADDIR also noted the new 
"anti-demand" standard imposed by the 2005 amendment to the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), and emphasized the 
USG intention to continue assisting Taiwan anti-trafficking 
efforts in any way possible. 
 
¶2.  NIA Immigration Affairs Director Chien acknowledged that 
Taiwan immigration, labor, law enforcement, and justice 
authorities still have much to do to meet international 
anti-trafficking standards, and are working in earnest to do 
so. Chien said she intends to enhance NIA's working 
relationship with Taiwan NGOs, using the United States 
experience as a model. Chien added that Taiwan's 
anti-trafficking task force is developing a standard 
procedure for the release of TIP victims into NGO care, and 
is seeking to secure a permanent budget for that purpose. 
She promised to provide AIT with the task force's next 
progress report, which should be released in the near future.
