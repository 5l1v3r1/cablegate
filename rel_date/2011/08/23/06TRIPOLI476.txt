SUBJECT: LIBYA SUBMITS GRANT APPLICATION FOR HHS ASSISTANCE IN 
PANDEMIC/AVIAN INFLUENZA 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  On August 29-31, 2006 Dr. Mustafa Mansour of Navy 
Medical Research Unit -3 of Cairo, and ESTH officer met with Dr. 
Abduhafid Abudher of the Libyan National (African) Center for 
Infectious Disease Control to finalize a grant application for 
U.S. assistance to the Libyan Government in public health issues 
associated with influenza preparedness.  The Libyans finalized a 
$1 Million grant application/request, as offered by the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to the Libyan 
General People's Committee for Health and Environment (GPCHE) as 
a non-competitive grant award.  The application was then locally 
approved and signed by Mr. Habeb Tamer, the Undersecretary of 
the GPCHE.  Pending HHS approval, the application will fully 
obligate the funds in FY06 monies for use by the GPCHE in FY07. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------- 
HHS Grant Fulfills Cooperative Agreement Signed in July: 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  During HHS Deputy Secretary Alex Azar's July visit to 
Tripoli, Dr. Tamer and Mr. Azar signed an agreement to 
participate in a cooperative initiative for the development of 
public health and security, with particular reference to public 
health incidents related to influenza.  Attached to this 
agreement was an offer by HHS to provide the GPCHE a 
non-competitive grant in the amount of USD$1 Million to foster 
this cooperation through continued partnerships in disease 
surveillance, preparedness and response capabilities.  The grant 
application signed by Mr. Tamer and Dr. Mansour on August 31, 
2006 aimed to fully obligate these funds to set up sentinel site 
staff and capabilities that integrated with Libya's existing 
disease surveillance infrastructure. 
 
----------------- 
Libyan Application Structured to Address Three Pillars of 
Preparedness: 
----------------- 
 
¶3.  HHS provided Dr. Mansour with an outline of a desired format 
for the proposal with some suggested benchmarks and areas of 
consideration that would be included in such an application. 
Dr. Abudher reviewed this outline, and presented it to the 
combined Libyan Committee for Public Health which consists of 
representatives from the GPCHE and the General People's 
Committee for Agriculture (GPCA).  The GPCA has dominion over 
the veterinary portion of disease surveillance and reporting. 
The group modified and completed the outline.  The combined 
committee was concerned that the document would not reflect 
Libya's existing disease surveillance and reporting 
capabilities, and ensured that the language in the proposal 
stated the grant money would be used to strengthen existing 
institutions, not establish new ones.  This was a very important 
point to both the GPCHE and GPCA leadership, and was reiterated 
several times to Dr. Mansour and ESTH Officer. 
 
 
¶4.  The application was titled: Surveillance and Response to 
Highly Pathogenic Avian and Pandemic Influenza in the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya, submitted in response to the RFP issued by the 
HHS Office of the Secretary, Office of Public Health and 
Science, Office of Global Health Affairs.  The application 
includes measures to address the three pillars of pandemic 
preparedness: a) Preparedness and Communication, b) Surveillance 
and Detection, c) Response and Containment.  Using these three 
pillars, a schedule of proposed activities through FY07 was 
established and agreed upon by the Libyans and Dr. Mansour.  The 
schedule outlined specific activities and the associated funding 
requested for each activity, as well as a separate section to 
allow for supplemental payments to sentinel and management staff 
that will be involved with the program. 
 
----------------- 
Libyan Committed to Accountability and Achieving Benchmarks: 
----------------- 
 
¶5.  Dr. Abudher was very concerned about meeting the U.S. 
expectations for the application, and paid strict attention to 
how the monies were allocated.  He asked how the grant would be 
dispensed, managed and accounted.  He and Mr. Tamer recommended 
establishing an account with two to three guardians with access 
to the funds.  They were open to suggestions from HHS, and 
welcomed any input in this matter.  They were also concerned 
about how the program would be benchmarked or evaluated, and 
sought input on a means of accountability to the timeline and 
scheduled activities.  They understood that the program was 
intended as a starting point for cooperation between U.S. and 
Libyan health communities, and were very excited about the 
opportunities for interaction that this program offered.  They 
will be seeking increased U.S. participation in Libyan health 
issues beyond the initial influenza program, and believe the HHS 
initiative will foster the working level relationships necessary 
to broaden the scope of cooperation. 
 
----------------- 
Next Steps: 
----------------- 
 
¶6.  HHS and the GPCHE will continue work on the specifics of the 
funds transfer, as well as the accountability to the schedule. 
Activities are planned in each of the three pillars that include 
either Libyan participation in regional workshops and programs, 
or visits to Libya by topical specialists.  These activities 
will continue working level contact and develop further 
cooperation between the U.S. and Libya.  Mr. Tamer and Dr. 
Abudher understand that this initial agreement is a framework 
for evaluating opportunities for further cooperation and 
establishing new programs.  Pending approval from HHS of the 
grant application, the Libyans are ready to move on the planned 
schedule of activities.  The only caveat to their eagerness is 
that the Ramadan season begins September 23, and this will 
certainly slow the initial progress of activities, but there is 
every opportunity to have the program fully functioning by the 
end of November. 
 
¶7.  U.S. travelers proposing grant-related travel to Libya 
should allow a minimum of eight weeks for visa approvals to be 
processed.  Similarly, Libyans must travel to Embassy Tunis to 
apply for visas and interagency proposals.  Follow-on activities 
should factor a minimum of eight weeks lead time if training in 
the U.S. is offered.  Any planned workshops that can be arranged 
in Cairo at the NAMRU-3 facility, pending facility availability, 
should be considered to minimize issues related to visa 
restrictions for travelers.
