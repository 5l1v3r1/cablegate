¶1. (SBU) Xie Zhenhua, the former Minister of the State Environmental 
Protection Administration (SEPA), who was sacked following the much 
publicized November 2005 chemical spill into the Songhua River, is 
about to be appointed as a Vice Chairman to the powerful National 
Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).  He will likely take over 
the environmental portfolio on the commission.  Xie's 
"rehabilitation" and his imminent appointment to a Minister-level 
position at the organization responsible for overseeing industrial 
planning and policy is noteworthy because of his strong 
environmental background and because many felt he was made an 
undeserving scapegoat for the Songhua spill.  End Summary. 
 
Xie is Back 
----------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Although not yet announced by China's State Council, the 
Hong Kong Press and NDRC's English-language website both state that 
Xie Zhenhua, former Minister of SEPA, will be appointed Vice 
Chairman of the NDRC, likely taking on the environmental portfolio. 
Xie resigned as SEPA Minster in December 2005 following the 
widespread negative national and international publicity that was 
generated following a massive nitrobenzene chemical spill at a 
state-owned China Petrochemical facility into the Songhua River in 
northern China. The pollutants flowed north into Russia, causing 
friction over the incident between Beijing and Moscow. 
 
¶3. (SBU) At the time of the spill, many thought Xie was made a 
scapegoat for the disaster since the spill (and the subsequent 
cover-up) happened at a China Petrochemical facility, a national 
level State Owned Enterprise, over which SEPA has nominal 
environmental oversight at best. Many observers thought that SEPA, 
which was responsible for the cleanup, took the fall because it has 
traditionally been the underfunded and understaffed weak sister in 
the Chinese bureaucracy.  The action also responded to popular 
frustration with SEPA's inability to enforce environmental 
regulations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Xie will become number five at the NDRC, as one of the 
twelve Vice Chairmen and he will be one of only four that are at the 
Minister level.  The environmental portfolio was previously held by 
Jiang Weixin, who is at the Vice Minister level.  It appears Jiang 
will remain on the NDRC, though it is unknown what portfolio he will 
hold. Organizational Note: The NDRC has one Chairman, Ma Kai, twelve 
Vice Chairmen, of which four are at the Minister level (Chen Deming, 
Wang Chunzheng, Zhang Guobao and Xie Zhenhua) and eight are at the 
Vice Minister level (Zhu Zhixin, Wnag Jinxiang, Jiang Weixin, Ou 
Xinqian, Zhang Mao, Zhang Xiaoqiang, Du Ying and Bi Jingquan).  End 
Note. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The NDRC, which is responsible for formulating industrial 
policy and planning, is a powerful player in China's bureaucracy. 
In the past, the NDRC focused almost exclusively on issues such as 
maximizing resource utilization, often giving little thought to the 
environmental consequences of its industrial planning policies. 
More recently, the NDRC has turned much of its attention to curbing 
high levels of investment in industries such as steel and cement. 
China's recent rhetoric that it wants to develop an environmentally 
sustainable economy now has more "meat," as Xie has a strong 
environmental background and is now in a position to influence both 
industrial policy and environmental protection.  Xie's quick 
"rehabilitation" from his disgrace following the Songhua incident, 
as well as China's  first ever emphasis on environmental protection 
in the new 11th Five-Year Plan seems to be a clear indication that 
the leadership is beginning to take environmental problems more 
seriously.  Xie's strong environmental credentials and his 
familiarity with both the United States Environmental Protection 
Administration and the White House Council on Environmental Quality 
bode well for future collaborations with NDRC on environmental 
issues.
