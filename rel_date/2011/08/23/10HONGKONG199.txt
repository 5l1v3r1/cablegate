¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Faced with declining passenger and cargo 
traffic, the Macau International Airport Company Ltd. (CAM) 
has ventured into the Mainland's Pearl River Delta (PRD) in 
hopes of better integrating its cargo and passenger services 
with the region.  An increase in air cargo volume from the 
PRD in late 2009 spurred CAM to pursue additional integration 
plans on the Mainland.  Meanwhile, Macau government funds 
have kept the city's two airlines operational, though CAM 
executives expressed dissatisfaction with the airlines poor 
business model.  With Macau's growing popularity as a tourist 
destination, they hoped U.S. airlines would soon make use of 
the existing U.S.-Macau air services agreement and launch 
services to "the Vegas of the East."  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (SBU) CAM Executive Director Suning Liu informed EconOff 
January 21 that a recent study revealed substantial cost 
savings for shippers who used the Macau International Airport 
(MIA) as a cargo hub, bypassing the longer and costlier river 
or truck routes to the eastern PRD airports of Shenzhen or 
Hong Kong.  The Macau Government (CAM's majority shareholder 
at 55.24%) then engaged Guangdong Province officials with 
this data to promote trucking services from Jiangmen and 
nearby cities to Macau.  The joint effort led to a 26% 
year-on-year increase in MIA's cargo volume for December 
2009, said Liu.  CAM is also pursuing a so-called "Virtual 
Airport Strategy" whereby it attracts PRD customers through 
its website portal and partnerships on the Mainland.  For 
example, MIA has started sharing with regional freight 
forwarders and manufacturers its shipping schedules for 
supply chain planning purposes.  It also started offering 
on-line check-in and bonded transportation services to 
Mainland passengers on flights from Macau to Australia, 
Vietnam, Indonesia, and Japan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Liu stressed that Macau's two airlines, Air Macau 
and Viva Macau, needed to join CAM's efforts to support 
Macau's aviation sector and economic development.  She 
expressed dissatisfaction with the airlines' poor business 
planning as both airlines' business models lacked the 
flexibility needed to cope with the industry's challenges. 
Air Macau was the exclusive holder of Macau's airline 
concession, and other Macau carriers could only operate under 
Air Macau-granted sub-concessions.  Its business model relied 
too heavily on serving the once-lucrative Taiwan to mainland 
China transit market, Liu explained.  The establishment of 
direct cross-Strait flights led to a remarkable decrease in 
transit passengers, adding to Air Macau's financial woes in 
an already challenging period.  In 2009, shareholders and the 
Macau Government provided US$63.4 million to recapitalize the 
airline.  But instead of seeking alternative markets, Air 
Macau opted in 2009 to lease its aircraft to Air China, its 
majority shareholder (52.25%) and China's flag-carrier.  Liu 
lamented this option may have improved Air Macau's bottom 
line but brought little economic benefit to Macau or its 
aviation sector. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Unable to participate in the Air Macau-monopolized 
short-haul routes and the Taiwan transit business, Macau's 
low-cost-carrier Viva Macau was pushed to venture into the 
long-haul market from its inception in 2006.  Liu credited 
Viva Macau with "putting the city" on the map, with routes 
throughout Japan, Korea, South East Asia and Australia. 
However, the economic downturn of 2009 and Viva Macau's 
unsuccessful cost-cutting measures plunged it into financial 
distress.  On January 19, the Macau Government came to its 
rescue with a US$25 million loan, a measure reflecting the 
government's strong support for the city's airline industry, 
said Macau's Secretary for Economy and Finance Francis Tam. 
 
¶5. (SBU) CAM handled 4.25 million passengers in 2009, down 
17% from the 5.1 million passengers handled in 2008.  Air 
cargo dropped by 48% to 52,260 tons from 100,760 in 2008. 
For 2010, CAM forecasts handling 4.6 million passengers and 
55,000 tons of air cargo, both conservative estimates still 
below 2008 levels.  CAM will continue working with the Macau 
Government to identify new air routes, promote Macau's 
tourism industry, and integrate its services with cities on 
the Mainland.  Incentives to airlines opening new routes will 
continue in 2010. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The United States and Macau signed an Aviation 
Transport Agreement (TIAS 12777) in 1996.  The agreement 
gives carriers on both sides broad flexibility to implement

air services, but no airline has yet made use of it.  Macau 
received more than 250,000 visitors from North America in 
¶2009.  As Macau's popularity as a tourist destination 
continued to grow, coupled with the lowest airport fees in 
the region, Liu said that air services to Macau by U.S. 
airlines would prove profitable and should be encouraged.
