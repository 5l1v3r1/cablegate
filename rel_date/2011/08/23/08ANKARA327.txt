Classified By: DCM Nancy McEldowney for reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY. The terrorist organization TAK (Kurdistan Freedom Falcons), close affiliate of the PKK terrorist group, announced February 19 it will initiate an extensive new wave of violence against military and civilian targets inside and outside Turkey. END SUMMARY.
 
¶2. (S) TAK, a deadly terrorist organization controlled and directed by the PKK, describes itself as "the vengeance force." Since 2004, the group has carried out dozens of attacks on military, government, and tourist sites within Turkey, with a spike in activities in 2006. TAK attacks have targeted and killed civilians, including foreign tourists; in March 2007 the group conducted a hotel bombing in the resort town of Antalya. Most recently, a TAK front group, the Kurdistan Revenge Brigade, claimed responsibility for a van packed with explosives, discovered and safely dismantled in Ankara on September 11, 2007. The same group reportedly claimed responsibility several days after the May 2007 Ankara suicide bombing, which killed 7 and wounded nearly 100.
 
¶3. (SBU) In a February 19 statement, TAK announced a comprehensive wave of new violence against all enemies and collaborators inside and outside Turkey. The statement claimed necessary preparations were complete and action was imminent.
 
¶4. (C) COMMENT. TAK's declared intent to unleash a new wave of violence indicates the squeeze PKK is feeling: on one side, frustration at Turkish military operations in the southeast and into northern Iraq, and on the other, wariness about further infuriating Turkey's Kurdish public already outraged by the PKK's January Diyarbakir bombing. Given TAK's long record of terrorist violence, we expect it will attempt to carry through on this latest pledge. END COMMENT.
