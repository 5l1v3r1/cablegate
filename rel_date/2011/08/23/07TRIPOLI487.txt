PROFESSIONALISM INTO HIV/AIDS DEBATE 
 
¶1. SUMMARY. On May 4-7 the Libyan National Center for Infectious 
Diseases Protection and Control (NCIDCP) held the first-ever 
Infectious and Endemic Diseases Scientific Conference in 
Tripoli, which included two sessions on HIV/AIDS in Libya. Most 
conference discussions were not highly technical, but the 
conference was well-attended by roughly 100-150 mostly Libyan 
health professionals and others.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
HIV/AIDS Roundtable Well Attended 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶2. Of the two conference sessions focused on HIV/AIDS, a 
roundtable discussion on when and how to react to the "HIV 
Epidemic in Libya" was by far the best attended, with more than 
60 people, mostly Libyans, participating. The at-times heated 
discussion noted that mortality resulting from HIV/AIDS is 
increasing and focused on what needs to be done to stop the 
infection rate, including methods of prevention, treatment, and 
increasing education and awareness about the disease. While the 
UK-based moderators aimed to discuss a national plan of action, 
the session was highly unstructured and served to give 
participants a venue to voice any and all thoughts relating to 
HIV/AIDS, including views on the Bulgarian medics court case. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Intravenous Drug Use Identified As Primary Risk Factor Among 
Libyans 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3.  The more technical conference session, including a 
presentation from Al-Fateh University on the epidemiology of the 
HIV infection in Libya, was not as widely attended, with roughly 
25 Libyans in the audience. The Faculty of Medicine of Tripoli's 
Al-Fateh University presented research conducted on 360 HIV 
patients receiving out-patient care at NCIDCP. Intravenous drug 
usage was found to be the primary risk factor in contracting HIV 
in Libya. Of the patients studied, 87 percent were males from 
21-40 years of age. The study found that 89 percent of the 360 
patients were tobacco smokers, 52 percent hashish smokers, and 
45 percent of patients reported alcoholism. The research group 
concluded that social work is essential to HIV/AIDS patient care 
and should be implemented in Libyan hospitals.

¶5. COMMENT. Aside from presentations on HIV/AIDS, the conference 
put on sessions related to practices of hygiene and 
sterilization in hospitals, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and avian 
influenza. The conference included a modest exhibition of 
medical equipment and a side workshop on human infectious 
disease surveillance put on by visiting Trilateral Steering and 
Cooperation Committee's Bio SubCommittee members (US, UK, and 
Libya).  While conference proceedings were not highly-technical 
or well-attended outside of the Libyan health community, it was 
a professional first attempt at openly addressing issues of 
public health.  END COMMENT.
