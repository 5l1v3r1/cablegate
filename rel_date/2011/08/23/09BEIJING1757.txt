¶1. Key points at the June 25 MFA press briefing: 
 
-- Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Qin Gang stated that 
recently Google was spreading "lewd and vulgar content," and as an 
internet enterprise operating in China, Google should "earnestly" 
abide by Chinese law.  All punitive measures taken by relevant 
authorities were conducted strictly according to Chinese law. 
 
-- China expressed its "strong displeasure" over Chinese fishermen 
seized by Indonesia in the South China Sea and urged Indonesia to 
release the fishermen at the earliest possible date. 
 
-- Asked about reports that dissident and Charter 08 signatory Liu 
Xiaobo had been arrested, Qin said that this case was not a matter 
for the MFA to comment.  However, Qin noted that China was a country 
"ruled by law" with an "independent judicial system." 
 
Official Block of Google? 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  It was the "common responsibility" for governments around the 
world to protect youth from online vulgar and pornographic content, 
and China found that recently Google had spread "lewd and vulgar 
content," said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Qin Gang at the June 25 
regularly scheduled MFA press briefing.  Relevant authorities had 
summoned those responsible and urged them to remove objectionable 
content.  As an internet enterprise operating in China, Google 
should "earnestly" abide by Chinese law, and all punitive measures 
taken by relevant authorities were conducted strictly according to 
Chinese law. 
 
Liu Xiaobo 
---------- 
 
¶3.  Asked about reports that dissident and Charter 08 signatory Liu 
Xiaobo had been arrested, Qin said that this case was not a matter 
for the MFA to comment.  However, Qin noted that China was a country 
"ruled by law" with an "independent judicial system." 
 
Chinese Fishermen Held by Indonesia 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  On June 20, eight Chinese fishing boats working in "traditional 
Chinese fishing grounds" in the South China Sea were seized and held 
by Indonesia.  China attached great importance to its sovereignty 
and the safety of Chinese citizens, and Qin said that the MFA and 
the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta had immediately expressed their 
"strong displeasure" over the incident and urged Indonesia to 
release the fishermen at the earliest possible date.  Qin said that 
all countries in the South China Sea region should use dialogue and 
consultation to ensure safety and stability in the area. 
 
North Korea 
------------ 
 
¶5.  Asked about reports that North Korea would not return to the 
negotiating table, Qin said that safeguarding peace and stability 
and achieving denuclearization was very important and that China 
hoped all parties would make contributions to achieve 
denuclearization and peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. 
Qin noted that China would continue its "unremitting efforts" to 
that effect.  Qin said China was willing to work with other 
countries to push North Korea back to the track of dialogue and that 
mutual trust was the key to progress on denuclearization.  However 
as a responsible member of the international community, China 
believed that the relevant UN Security Council resolution clearly 
stated that all parties should not take measures that impact the 
normal activities and livelihood of the North Korean people.  Asked 
about reports that Kim Jong-un visited China and was granted a 
meeting with President Hu Jintao but was not given a meeting at the 
MFA, Qin said he had no information on any such visit.  Asked if 
North Korean Foreign Minister Paik Nam-sun visited China June 13 to 
meet with PLA leaders, Qin noted that he did not have the meeting 
schedule of PLA leaders and referred such questions to the Defense 
Ministry. 
 
Clinton-Yang Call 
------------------ 
 
 
BEIJING 00001757  002.3 OF 002 
 
 
¶6.  Qin noted that Secretary Clinton and FM Yang had a phone call in 
which they exchanged views on items of common interest including 
bilateral relations and North Korea. 
 
Chinese Diplomat Expelled? 
-------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Asked about reports that a Chinese diplomat had been expelled 
from Sweden for spying on Uighurs, Qin noted that   China required 
its diplomats to follow the Vienna Convention, observe national laws 
and promote bilateral relations.  Qin said that China hoped foreign 
diplomats would follow the same customs, but noted that for those 
diplomats who violate China's laws, they are "of course not welcome" 
in China. 
 
Burma Oil Deal Signed 
--------------------- 
 
¶8.  Asked about the recent visit of a delegation from Burma, Qin 
noted that an agreement was signed for an oil pipeline and that a 
statement had been released with further details of the project. 
 
India Trade Protection 
---------------------- 
 
¶9. Qin said he was not aware of any protectionist measures taken by 
the Indian Government, however China "always opposed" trade 
protectionism.  Qin noted that Chinese products were both 
inexpensive and of good quality and would "bring benefit to the 
Indian people," while trade barriers would "undermine the interests 
of the Indian people." 
 
Visits 
------ 
 
¶10.  Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirayuda would visit China 
July 1-2.  Qin noted that Indonesia and China had a "strategic 
partnership" and that bilateral trade had reached $31.2 billion in 
¶2008.  Qin said that the upcoming visit would allow the two sides to 
enhance their strategic partnership.  He said that China also hoped 
to use the visit to "properly resolve" the dispute over the seized 
Chinese fishermen in the South China Sea. 
 
¶11.  Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama would visit 
China from July 1-5. Qin noted that China and Sri Lanka had enjoyed 
diplomatic relations for fifty-two years and that the two countries 
had deep cooperation on many levels and that since it was mutually 
beneficial, China supported the further development of bilateral 
relations.  China also supported efforts at national reconciliation 
within Sri Lanka and that China was willing to play a "consequential 
and positive role" in these efforts. 
 
¶12.  Vice President Joseph Nyumah Boakai of the Republic of Liberia 
would visit China from July 5-11.  Hungarian Foreign Minister Pter 
Balzs would visit China from July 2-5.
