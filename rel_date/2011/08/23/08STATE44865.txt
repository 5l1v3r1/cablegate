SUBJECT: RECOGNITION OF EXEMPLARY PERFORMANCE ON BLUE 
LANTERN CHECKS: O'CONNOR, KIM, AND YANG 
 
 
¶1. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
outstanding performance of economic officers Matthew O'Connor 
and Lisa Yang and EXBS advisor Mi-Yong Kim for their timely 
and thorough investigation of Blue Lantern cases.  As you 
know, the Blue Lantern program is the Department's primary 
instrument for monitoring the end-use of exported defense 
articles, technology, and services.  This program is 
indispensable to PM's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls 
in making informed licensing decisions, discovering illicit 
supply networks, and deterring diversions of U.S. military 
articles and technology. 
 
¶2. Since the beginning of FY2008, AIT/T's Blue Lantern team 
has managed 14 Blue Lantern cases, many of them complex and 
requiring considerable effort to complete.  Despite this 
heavy case load, Mr. O'Connor and Mss. Kim and Yang provided 
detailed responses in a very timely manner, with many cases 
being closed within two weeks.  Their diligence, 
thoroughness, and professionalism continues AIT/T Blue 
Lantern team's long and proud tradition of outstanding effort 
and results, which have helped to facilitate the flow of 
legitimate defense trade while safeguarding against diversion 
and misuse. 
 
¶3. The PM Bureau and the Department are grateful for the 
efforts of Mr. O'Connor and Mss. Kim and Yang, which have 
demonstrably contributed to the security and integrity of 
U.S. defense trade.
