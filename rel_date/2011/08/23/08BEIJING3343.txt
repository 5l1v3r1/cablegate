Summary 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Beijing Mayor GUO Jinlong warmly welcomed Secretary of 
Labor Elaine L. Chao and thanked her for leading the U.S. 
Presidential Delegation to the Olympics Closing Ceremony.  The Games 
left a "precious legacy" for both Beijing and China that had 
"showcased" the achievements of the PRC's opening and reform drive 
and that will continue to benefit the city's development.  Passing 
the Olympic flag to IOC President Jacques Rogge at the August 24 
Closing Ceremony was "deeply moving," Mayor Guo said, noting that in 
doing so China "fulfilled its commitments" made when it was awarded 
the right to host the Games seven years ago.  Beijing nevertheless 
still faces the task of hosting the September Paralympic Games. 
Secretary Chao complimented Mayor Guo on a successful Olympics, 
noting the impressive job the Mayor, his staff and the people of 
Beijing had done in staging the Games.  In particular, Secretary 
Chao said she heard reports that the massive Beijing construction 
efforts for the Olympics had proceeded smoothly and that the city 
had strengthened enforcement of wage, health and safety standards on 
the construction sites.  The Mayor thanked Secretary Chao for her 
comments but said Beijing still has "a long way to go," as it 
remains the capital of a developing country.  Noting Secretary 
Chao's "very important position" as the first Asian American woman, 
and the first Chinese American, to be a member of a President's 
cabinet, Mayor Guo said he would welcome the Secretary to share her 
experiences, comments and advice with the Beijing Municipal 
Government at anytime as a means of enhancing exchanges between 
China and the United States.  End Summary. 
 
Warm Welcome 
------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Beijing Mayor GUO Jinlong warmly welcomed visiting 
Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao to the Beijing Municipal 
Government offices on August 26, thanking her for leading the U.S. 
Presidential Delegation to the August 24 Olympics Closing Ceremony. 
Mayor Guo expressed pleasure at learning that Secretary Chao's 
father, Dr. James Chao, had traveled to China with her.  Secretary 
Chao, accompanied by Ambassador Randt, noted that she was pleased to 
see Mayor Guo again, following their initial meeting at the August 
24 luncheon hosted by President Hu Jintao. 
 
Olympics:  China's Commitments Fulfilled 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Reflecting on the just-completed Olympics, Mayor Guo said 
the Games had left behind a "precious legacy" for Beijing and all of 
China.  The Games "spread the Olympic spirit," helped enhance 
China's friendship with the world's peoples and showcased the 
achievements of China's opening and reform drive.  Beijing's urban 
planning and development also benefited from the Games, and the 
Olympics' impact will continue to be "instrumental" for the city's 
future development. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Passing the Olympic flag to IOC President Jacques Rogge at 
 
BEIJING 00003343  002 OF 002 
 
 
the August 24 Closing Ceremony was "deeply moving," Mayor Guo said, 
noting that in doing so he felt China "fulfilled its commitments" 
made seven years when it was awarded the right to host the Games. 
Hosting the Olympics is an aspiration the Chinese people have held 
for more than a century.  When it was selected as the host city, 
Beijing was already well aware that the Olympics belong not just to 
China but to all the world's peoples.  Over the past seven years, 
due to the resolute leadership of the Central Government and the 
generous support of Chinese people both on the Mainland and abroad, 
China diligently prepared for the Games and "fulfilled its 
commitments to the international community," successfully 
endeavoring to hold a green, high-tech, people's Olympics designed 
to satisfy the international community, the athletes and the general 
public. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Beijing still faces the task of hosting a successful 
Paralympic Games in September, Mayor Guo said, explaining that the 
Beijing Organizing Committee of the Olympic Games(BOCOG) held a 
meeting that very morning to discuss preparations.  Guo said BOCOG 
plans to "follow the Olympic spirit" to prepare well for these Games 
so as to take good care of both the participating Paralympians and 
friends from around the world. 
 
Eyes of the World Upon China 
---------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Secretary Chao complimented Mayor Guo on a successful 
Olympics, stating that the Mayor, his staff and the people of 
Beijing had done a tremendously impressive job of staging the Games. 
 The eyes of the entire world have been upon China, and many had 
anxiously waited to see whether Beijing could perform under the 
"bright lights" of global scrutiny.  Mayor Guo and the people of 
China deserve great credit for having held very successful Games. 
Secretary Chao complimented in particular the work of volunteers in 
Beijing.  Noting that the Mayor previously said he expected the 
Games would improve the civility and manners of the population, 
Secretary Chao said she could attest personally to the friendliness 
and excellent English ability of the volunteers.  A group from 
Kentucky, the Secretary's home state, had traveled to China for the 
first time to help out at the USA House in Beijing, and its members 
had been deeply impressed by the hospitality of all the Chinese 
people with whom they met, the Secretary noted. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Secretary Chao said she also understood that Beijing's 
construction efforts had proceeded smoothly and that the city had 
created rigorous wage, health and safety conditions.  Achieving 
praise in this sector is no easy task, the Secretary stated. 
Secretary Chao also noted the very impressive Closing Ceremony, 
commenting that in handing over the Olympic flag, Beijing has set a 
very high standard for London to meet. 
 
Beijing:  "Still Developing" 
---------------------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Mayor Guo thanked Secretary Chao for her comments on the 
Games but replied that Beijing still has "a long way to go," as it 
remains the capital city of a developing country.  With a total 
population of 16 million, Beijing possesses a per capita GDP of USD 
7,654 as of 2007.  Thus, Beijing is still "in the process" of 
developing, but it will build upon the legacy of the Olympics and, 
following the guidance of the "Scientific Development Concept," will 
strive to become a metropolis that is prosperous, harmonious and 
environmentally friendly. 
 
Secretary Chao's Important Position 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) Mayor Guo said Secretary Chao is in a "very important 
position" as the first Asian American woman, and the first Chinese 
American, to be a member of a United States President's cabinet. 
The Mayor said he would welcome Secretary Chao to share her 
experiences, comments and advice with the Beijing Municipal 
Government at anytime as a means of enhancing exchanges between 
China and the United States. 
 
¶12.  (U) Secretary Chao cleared this message.
