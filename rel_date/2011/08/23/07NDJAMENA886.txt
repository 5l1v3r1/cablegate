¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Despite indications that he might be 
released shortly, seized American missionary Steve Godbold is 
still in the hands of MDJT rebels in the Tibesti region of 
Chad. End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 8 the Al-Wihda website announced that 
the MDJT splinter group claiming to hold seized Amcit Steve 
Godbold had posted a message stating that they intended to 
release Godbold in the coming days.  At a meeting with Deputy 
Interior Minister Djasnabaille the same day, Djasnabaille 
informed Charge that he was under the impression that Godbold 
would soon be released based on an unexpected phone call from 
MDJT leader Choa Dazi the night before.  (Note: As a former 
member of the opposition, Djasnabaille explained that he 
previously had contact with Dazi. End not). 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Subsequently, however, phone contact with Choa 
Dazi dropped.  The Red Cross has not heard from him, and 
Godbold's missionary colleagues in N'Djamena have been told 
that Dazi's Libyan cell phone is no longer being used. 
Godbold's colleagues do not have any first hand information, 
but they speculate that Dazi himself may no longer be calling 
the shots, and that the small group of MDJT rebels holding 
Godbold deep in the Tibesti are now the lead actors in 
determining Godbold's fate. If this is the case, Godbold's 
colleagues believe that these individuals are primarily 
interested in a ransom. They have also heard through 
intermediaries that Godbold is depressed and is not eating. 
If there are no new developments, TEAM (the Evangelical 
Alliance Mission) may request Red Cross (ICRC) assistance in 
monitoring Godbold's state of health (if the hostage takers 
permit). 
 
 
¶3. (SBU)In a meeting with TEAM members on November 14 we 
discussed the possible role of Libya in Dazi's apparent 
change of heart.  TEAM members had heard that the quote 
American request to Libyan authorities for assistance end 
quote may have spooked Dazi.  Charge clarified that we had 
asked Libyan authorities for information, not assistance and 
that nothing had been reported back to N'Djamena. TEAM 
members also informed us that Dazi and possibly others in the 
group are dual nationals holding French passports. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Godbold's local organization is being assisted by a 
representative from Crisis Consulting International (CCI), 
Bob Klamser, scheduled to arrive in Chad on November 15. 
Charge, RSO and DATT will meet with TEAM and Klamser on 
November 16. Charge will request a meeting with GOC 
authorities for an update on the situation and report on any 
new developments. 
 
Comment 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Quiet pressure by the Tubu community continues to 
be seen as the best way to advance Godbold's release, 
although the MDJT rebels holding him are described as 
renegades who are less susceptible to community pressure. 
 
¶6. Minimized considered.
