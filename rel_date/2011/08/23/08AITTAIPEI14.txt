Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused January 4 
news coverage on KMT presidential Ma Ying-jeou's suit against the 
prosecutor who indicted him for corruption; on Brazilian 
authorities' unexpected cessation of issuance of visas to tourists 
from Taiwan; the upcoming legislative election; and on the rise of 
oil and commodity prices.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, 
an editorial in the pro-independence, English-language "Taipei 
Times" criticized the United States opposition to Taiwan's UN 
referendum and asked the United States to respect the Taiwan 
people's will and Taiwan's democratic development. 
 
"Enough Muddle-Headed Warnings" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taipei Times" [circulation: 
30,000] editorialized (1/4): 
 
"... The decision [about KMT boycotts of the two referenda to be 
held along with the legislative election on January 12] came just a 
few weeks after KMT vice presidential candidate Vincent Siew 
allegedly told American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond 
Burghardt that the KMT was insisting on the two-step voting process 
to frustrate the DPP-initiated referendum on entering the UN using 
the name 'Taiwan.' 
 
"It would be interesting to know if Burghardt's conversations with 
any of the KMT officials he met during his visit touched on the 
subject of a boycott, as any decision to shun the UN plebiscite in 
March would certainly fall in line with Washington's very public 
opposition to the process. ... 
 
"... In a September speech to the US-Taiwan Business Council, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs 
Thomas Christensen accused President Chen Shui-bian of using the 
referendum to 'charge Taiwan's name' and 'risk the security 
interests of the Taiwan people for short term political gain.' ... 
 
"Perhaps Christensen could have been asked to suggest which 
political party in the democratic world does not attempt to 
influence public opinion to further its ambitions.  The Republicans 
certainly did so when it made the case for the invasion of Iraq. 
... 
 
"... Even now it is not clear if US strategists are banking on 
economic reform leading to democratic reform in China and a peaceful 
settlement in the Taiwan Strait.  But even if this is the case, it 
is not going to happen anytime soon.  Hard-headed officials must 
therefore understand that Taiwan's status cannot remain in limbo 
indefinitely if China issues threats every few months and continues 
to pack its coastline with ordnance. 
 
"Taiwanese are not stupid; indeed, they are reliably pragmatic. 
Poll after poll has shown that the overwhelming majority are not 
interested in making dramatic ideological gambits in the cause of 
independence or unification. 
 
"So, if Washington believes that this thing called 'democracy' has 
value outside the US, then it should show respect to Taiwanese by 
desisting with patronizing language and partisan doomsaying.  Voters 
of goodwill are putting up with enough cynical, anti-democratic 
behavior from the KMT without having to factor in muddle-headed 
warnings from Washington."
