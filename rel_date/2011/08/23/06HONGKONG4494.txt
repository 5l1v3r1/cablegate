REF: A) USDOC 05674 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the Bureau of 
Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control Officer 
(ECO) Philip Ankel conducted a post shipment 
verification (PSV) at Bloomberg (HK) (Bloomberg). This 
PSV concerned computer boards exported by Stradis, 
Inc. of Atlanta, Georgia (Stradis), classified as 
4A001 and valued at $4,851.  Items classified as 4A001 
are controlled for national security (NS) and anti- 
terrorism (AT) reasons and may be controlled for 
missile technology (MT) reasons. 
 
¶3. On November 9, 2006, the ECO visited Bloomberg at 
its Hong Kong headquarters on the 26th floor of the 
Cheung Kong Centre, 2 Queen's Road, Hong Kong and met 
with compliance manager Cynthia Lam and procurement 
manager Eddie Chau.  Ms. Lam stated that Bloomberg 
(HK) is the local operation of the global data, news 
and analytics provider, Bloomberg (more information at 
www.bloomberg.com).  It is apparent from the tour of 
the facility provided by Ms. Lam that this is 
Bloomberg's Hong Kong office. 
 
¶4.  Ms. Lam and Bloomberg staff members were open and 
cooperative during the PSV.  Ms. Lam arranged for the 
ECO to inspect the items that were the subject of the 
PSV.  One was still in its original packaging.  Three 
additional items had already been installed in 
computers, which were produced for the ECO's 
inspection.  The items are used in the storage and 
editing of video clips for Bloomberg's video 
productions. 
 
¶5. The ECO believes Bloomberg to be a very suitable 
recipient of U.S. origin controlled technology as it 
cooperated with the ECO, has a line of business that 
is consistent with the item's potential use, provided 
relevant documentation and allowed an on-site visit. 
The ECO recommends that this PSV be classified as 
Favorable.
