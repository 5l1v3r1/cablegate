SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: NORTH KOREA 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused May 30 to 
June 1 news coverage on President Ma Ying-jeou's visit to Central 
America; on the development of cross-Strait relations; and on local 
law enforcement's seizure of the popular energy drink from Austria, 
Red Bull, after the drink was found to containing tiny traces of 
cocaine.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, an op-ed in the 
pro-unification "United Daily News" commented on North Korea's 
recent series of provocative moves.  The op-ed said North Korea is 
just using dramatic moves to get what it wants and needs from the 
international community in order to achieve domestic cohesion and 
overcome its internal problems, such as Kim Jong-il's health and the 
decision about his successor.  The op-ed said the international 
community should still use diplomacy with North Korea, because the 
country does not really want to launch another Korean War at the 
moment.  End summary. 
 
"North Korea's Big Move; Taking Advantage from Inside and Outside?" 
 
Lee Ming, professor of the Department of Diplomacy at the National 
Chengchi University, opined in the pro-unification "United Daily 
News" [circulation: 400,000] (5/31): 
 
"... Will the Korean Peninsula resemble a game of chicken...?  It 
does not seem that the situation will be that bad. ...The United 
States understands that it cannot subdue North Korea simply by 
putting pressure [on North Korea].  Although it needs China to act 
as a matchmaker to bring North Korea back to the negotiation table 
and launch the new round of six-party talks, the United States does 
not rule out [the possibility] of finding a new path to holding 
bilateral talks with North Korea, which is also what North Korea 
wants. ... 
 
"North Korea is unlikely to launch another Korean War.  After all, 
today's South Korea is not what it was before [and] North Korea is 
no longer the rival it once was, lined up against South Korea and 
the United States.  What North Korea wants is for the United States 
to resume economic aid; cease economic sanctions; and even establish 
diplomatic ties as soon as possible.  North Korea hopes the Obama 
administration will not forget that these wishes are what the United 
States promised North Korea during the Clinton Administration in 
Â¶1994. ..."
