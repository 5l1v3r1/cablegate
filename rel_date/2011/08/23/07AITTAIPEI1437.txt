1.(SBU) SUMMARY. From May 07 - 18 and June 04 - 15, 2007, the US 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) co-sponsored with Taiwan two 
International Avian Influenza Diagnostic Workshops targeting the 
lesser developed economies of Southeast Asia (SEA). The two 
Workshops increased Taiwan's exposure to the international 
community, particularly in Southeast Asia, allowing them to make new 
contacts and share common animal health/animal disease experiences. 
This is especially important in light of the recent events which 
transpired during the last session of the World Organization for 
Animal Health (OIE) in Paris, where Taiwan felt its status was 
downgraded. The USDA AI Workshops were held in conjunction with 
Taiwan's Council of Agriculture (COA), Animal Health Research 
Institute (AHRI) at their state of the art facilities.  Taiwan 
contributed many resources, including free use of lab facilities, 
dormitory space, and technical staff, to support the USDA Avian 
Influenza effort. Fifty diagnosticians from various SEA economies 
received the training. End Summary. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) USDA, through its International Avian Influenza 
Coordination Group, supports numerous Avian Influenza capacity 
building and infrastructure development initiatives and projects 
throughout the lesser developed world. Through USDA's APHIS and FAS 
offices at AIT, the Coordination Group was able to identify Taiwan 
as an ideal partner to focus delivery of AI laboratory diagnostic 
techniques in virology/serology and molecular biology to the lesser 
developed economies of Southeast Asia (SEA). Originally, only one 
diagnostic course was scheduled in Taiwan, but due to overwhelming 
need for AI diagnostics in SEA, a second course was added to meet 
demand. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) One important benefit of the Workshop was the 
international exposure it brought for Taiwan, allowing Taiwan 
officials to make new contacts in the region, and  share common 
experiences in combating animal diseases and addressing animal 
health concerns. This is especially important in light of recently 
transpired events at the last session of the World Organization for 
Animal Health (OIE), where Taiwan's membership status in this 
organization was, in their eyes, downgraded. It also allowed for 
Taiwan to make a valuable contribution to the international 
community and the region by sharing its expertise and technical 
resources with its lesser developed neighbors, while working 
alongside the United States. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) A total of fifty diagnosticians from eight SEA economies, 
including Taiwan, participated in the two Workshops. Economies which 
participated were: Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri 
Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Two other economies, Myanmar 
and Bangladesh, were also invited to attend the Workshops, but 
citing adherence to a "one China policy" withdrew their 
participation. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) While USDA supplied expert training staff and travel funds 
to the selected SEA participants, Taiwan contributed free use of 
their state of the art laboratory facilities and lecture hall as a 
venue for the Workshops. This included use of dormitory rooms for 
the SEA participants at no charge. Additional Taiwan support 
included the use of AHRI lab technicians to assist the USDA training 
staff during instruction. The APHIS office at AIT provided local and 
international/regional coordination and logistical support, 
procurement, and local budget management for both Workshops. 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: By all accounts, the Workshops have been deemed 
successful, confirmed through written feedback surveys from the 
participants, the experiences relayed by the USDA instructors, and 
responses from the Taiwan Authorities, including both COA and AHRI 
officials. Plans for continued technical collaboration are underway 
between USDA, APHIS and COA, through its Bureau of Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) and the Animal Technology 
 
 
Institute of Taiwan (ATIT). Subject matter experts from APHIS' 
Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health (CEAH) have agreed to 
conduct an Epidemiology Course for Taiwan candidates during October 
¶2007. Additional, future technical cooperation and collaboration 
projects are being considered by both USDA and COA for 2008 and 
beyond. 
End Comment.
