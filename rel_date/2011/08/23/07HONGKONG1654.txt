¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information 
provided below is prohibited by Section 12C of the 
Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export 
Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted a 
pre-license check (PLC) at Esteem Industries 
Limited, 9/F, 9 Wing Hong Street, Cheung Sha Wan, 
Kowloon, Hong Kong (Esteem). The purpose of the 
visit was to determine the suitability of Esteem 
to be a recipient of a thermovision, infrared 
thermal imaging camera that is the subject of 
license application D377129.  The item (ECCN 
6A003) is valued at USD 24,950 and is controlled 
for national security (NS) and nuclear 
nonproliferation (NP) reasons. The license 
applicant is Sunbeam Products, Inc. of Boca Raton, 
Florida. 
 
¶3.  A review of Hong Kong Companies Registry 
records reveals that Esteem has been in existence 
since 1989.  Its paid-in capital is the Hong Kong 
equivalent of USD two million.  U.K. national Ian 
Guy Handley Ashken, U.S. national Martin Ellis 
Franklin and Hong Kong identity card holder Woon 
Fai Liu are listed as directors. 
 
¶4. On May 21, 2007, the ECO visited Esteem at the 
address above and met with Tony Tam, Group Manager 
and Mickey Cheung, Purchasing Manager.  Mr. Tam 
stated that Esteem is part of the Jarden 
Corporation group of companies.  Jarden 
Corporation is a NYSE listed company and a 
worldwide producer of niche consumer products. Mr. 
Tam stated that Jarden Consumer Solutions (JCS) 
acquired Sunbeam Products, Inc. as well as the 
Holmes Group in 2005.  Both companies are 
producers of various consumer products under brand 
names such as Crock-Pot, Mr. Coffee, Oster, 
Sunbeam and others.  Esteem, formerly part of 
Holmes Group, is now a subsidiary of JCS. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Tam stated that as a result of corporate 
restructuring, some Sunbeam facilities in Boca 
Raton, Florida will be consolidated and some 
operations from those facilities will be moved to 
Hong Kong.  More specifically, the infrared camera 
will no longer be used in Boca Raton and is 
therefore being exported to Hong Kong for use in 
the Hong Kong operation's product development and 
testing operations.  The camera will be used in a 
small lab being prepared for this purpose at the 
Esteem headquarters location.  Various products 
that generate heat as an aspect of their operation 
(i.e., toaster ovens) will be tested with the 
camera.  The ECO reviewed the proposed location of 
the testing lab and it appeared suitable for the 
applicable use of the camera. 
 
¶6. At the time visited, Esteem appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the subject controlled items 
since it cooperated fully with the PLC and 
provided information on the proposed use of the 
items.  In addition, Esteem operates a line a 
business that is consistent with the potential use 
of the ordered items.  The ECO recommends that 
this PLC be classified as Favorable.
