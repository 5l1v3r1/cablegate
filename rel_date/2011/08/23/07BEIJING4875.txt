NAME CHANGE PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 101525 
 
¶1. (SBU) Charge delivered reftel points to MFA Arms Control 
and Disarmament Department Director General Zhang Yan July 
25, voicing U.S. concerns that the proposed name change for 
the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Inter-Sessional Meeting (ISM) 
on Nonproliferation would broaden the meeting's scope beyond 
the intended purpose of nonproliferation capacity building. 
 
¶2. (SBU) DG Zhang said he is familiar with the issue, which 
he discussed with U.S. officials during the previous week's 
Six-Party Talks in Beijing.  While insisting the issue should 
be raised directly with the Indonesians, Zhang pledged to 
work with his counterparts in the MFA's Department of Asian 
Affairs to ensure the MFA understands the issue and its 
importance. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Charge reiterated that we look to China to partner 
with the United States and Singapore to strengthen security 
work in the ARF and to urge Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia 
towards a position that will yield substantial outcomes for 
the ARF's nonproliferation efforts.  Charge left Reftel 
points as a nonpaper.
