REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated April 22, 2009 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post shipment verification (PSV) at Nabond Technology HK, Co., 
Ltd., Unit 1001, Forseas Bldg, 208-212 Nathan Road, Hong Kong 
(Nabond). The items in question for this PSV are 10 pieces of Duocel 
silicon carbide ceramic exported to Nabond on or about October 10, 
¶2008.  On the applicable shippers export declaration (SED), these 
items are not classified meaning that they are likely EAR99 and 
eligible for shipment to virtually all destinations and 
end-uses/users worldwide.  The exporter was ERG Materials and 
Aerospace of Oakland California. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Nabond has been 
in existence since 2007.  Its paid up share capital is the Hong Kong 
equivalent of USD 13.  The Hong Kong Companies Registry lists 
Chinese Mainland national, Zhang, Chuanyi, as director (with 
mainland China passport number 440106197770809184X). 
 
¶4.  According to the company's web site (www.nabond.com), Nabond is 
a R&D company focusing on the manufacture and application of nano 
materials, adhesives and related machines.  The company's contact 
details listed on its web site make reference to a Shenzhen address 
and phone number.  According to the company's web site, it is able 
to provide a range of nano-materials for sale. 
 
¶5.  On May 27, 2009, ECO accompanied by Commercial Assistant, Carrie 
Chan, visited Nabond and met with Mr. Tom Lee, General Manager.  The 
meeting occurred at the offices of company secretarial service 
company, ATA Corporate Formation & Management Limited.  The ship to 
address on the ERG shipping documents (as distinct from the ATA 
address) corresponds to the address of freight forwarder Safe 
Velocity Express Ltd.  Mr. Lee's office within ATA had a sign above 
the doorway indicating that it was the office of Nabond.  ECO 
suspects this was done to give Nabond the appearance of having a 
Hong Kong operation when, in fact, it has no real Hong Kong 
presence. 
 
¶6.  According to Mr. Lee, Nabond ordered the items in question to 
use in the research and development of very light ceramic products 
able to withstand up to 1000 degree temperatures.  These would be 
used in vehicle engine applications.  Mr. Lee stated that the 
company has a range of overseas customers including Unico and BASF. 
In fact, Mr. Lee stated that few domestic Chinese companies have an 
interest in his company's products and he therefore produces 
primarily for export.  Mr. Lee stated that he has no government 
customers and stated further that government agencies would see his 
company as too small to deal with.  Mr. Lee stated that his company 
has eight staff. 
 
¶7.  When asked about the disposition of the items, Mr. Lee stated 
that they had been for use at the company's R&D lab in Hong Kong. 
When asked for an address, Mr. Lee demurred, claiming that the 
location of the Hong Kong lab was a trade secret. 
 
 
 
 
¶8.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes that Nabond 
most likely does not have any permanent Hong Kong presence and uses 
its Hong Kong address to receive shipments and correspond with 
international clients and suppliers.  While there is no apparent 
export control violation associated with this shipment, ECO 
nonetheless does not believe Nabond to be a suitable recipient of 
controlled U.S. origin technology.
