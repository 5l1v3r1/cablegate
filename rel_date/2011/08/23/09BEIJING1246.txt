SUBJECT: CHINA - SHIP RECYCLING DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 41904 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff coordinated with the Australian Embassy to deliver 
the demarche on the International Maritime Organization's (IMO's) 
Ship Recycling Convention to the Chinese Ministry of Transport (MOT) 
and the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on May 4.  Chinese Government 
representatives stated they would consider the joint U.S.-Australian 
position paper, but had no formal response.  A contact at the Trade 
in Goods Division of MOFCOM's WTO Affairs Department told the 
Australian Embassy that their preliminary review revealed concerns 
with World Trade Organization (WTO) compliance.  They intended to 
provide input to MOT members attending the Convention. 
 
¶2. (SBU) A representative from MOT's Multi-lateral Affairs Division 
of the International Cooperation Department confirmed MOT would 
represent China at the Convention in Hong Kong.  However, the 
delegation members had been abroad, and would not gather to meet 
before the conference until late on May 8, when they would review 
the U.S. demarche.  Econoff encouraged the Chinese to share their 
final views with the U.S delegation at the Convention.
