SUBJECT: PROJECTED COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES IN LIBYA FOR DAY OF 
MOURNING 
 
In commemoration of the Libyan Day of Mourning, the GOL has 
informed post that on Thursday, October 26, both internet, 
international phone calls and international air travel will be 
cut off nationwide from 6AM to 6 PM.   In practice, over the 
past several years, communications outages have been limited to 
several hours during the afternoon.  Post can be reached by 
inmarsat: 881-676-31-5208.  The Day of Mourning commemorates an 
outrage committed by Italy against Libya in 1911 during which 
thousands of Libyans were deported from their country and never 
seen again.  In addition to the cutoff from the outside world, 
flags will be flown at half staff, television will be broadcast 
in black and white and posters evoking the memory of the event 
will appear in major cities.
