SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Rising asset and consumer prices, and Central Government 
reactions to the increases, continued to draw attention during the 
recently concluded "Golden Week" period.  With the 17th Party 
Congress set to open on Monday, October 15, inflation remains a 
predominant domestic economic concern.  Illustrating the intense 
public interest in rising prices, one local Beijing newspaper 
featured a special section on October 2 that took a comprehensive 
look at price increases in the housing market and stock market as 
well as continued CPI inflation and the impact of recent shocks on 
urbanites.  END SUMMARY 
 
NEW SURVEYS REFLECT CONCERNS 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On the cusp of the October 1 National Day Holiday -- one of 
China's "Golden Weeks" when offices are closed for seven days in 
order to stimulate consumption through shopping and travel -- 
government surveys indicated that rising prices are causing a fall 
in stisfaction with the economy for the first time in recent 
memory.  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) reported on September 20 
that: 
 
--The 3rd Quarter National Bankers Survey showed that the bankers' 
confidence index had decreased to its lowest level historically with 
83 percent of bankers stating that they are concerned about the 
economy; 
 
--The 3rd Quarter Entrepreneurs survey similarly demonstrated that 
confidence is slipping with the entrepreneurs' confidence index 
falling by 6.4 percent; and 
 
--In the 3rd Quarter Urban Depositors Survey, nearly half (47.1 
percent) of respondents said prices are "too high." 
 
¶3. (U) Facing mounting concerns on prices, the National Development 
Reform Commission (NDRC), together with seven other ministries, 
issued a notice on September 21 which emphasized the importance of 
price stability during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day 
Holiday.  The circular cited the recent surge in the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI), which rose by 6.5 percent year-on-year in August (Ref 
A, B, C), the highest rate in over ten years, and recommended 
measures for alleviating price pressures during the holidays. 
Chinese economists have expressed concerns about price stability 
since the summer with one prominent China Academy of Social Sciences 
(CASS) researcher stating in mid-August that China is "entering an 
inflationary period" (Ref A). 
 
HOUSING MARKET DRAWS RENEWED ATTENTION 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Late September also brought new Central Government 
pronouncements on housing prices with the NDRC announcing that 
housing prices have continued to accelerate in 2007.  Over recent 
months, housing prices rose in 70 large and medium cities as 
follows: 
 
MONTH  PERCENTAGE INCREASE (yoy) 
 
April    5.4 
May     6.4 
June     7.1 
July     7.5 
August    8.2 
 
The PBOC and China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) attracted 
widespread public attention on September 27 when they jointly issued 
a notice that seeks to strengthen mortgage loan management in an 
effort to curb the rise in housing prices and speculation in the 
property market.  The PBOC-CBRC notice requires commercial banks to 
increase mortgage loan interest rates to 1.1 times the benchmark 
one-year lending rate and also requires higher down payments on 
houses. 
 
PBOC PREDICTS CONTINUED INFLATION

¶5. (U) The PBOC Monetary Policy Committee stated after its 3rd 
Quarter Conference on September 28 that excess investment growth, 
China's trade surplus and excess loan issuance continue to exert 
inflationary pressure on prices.  (Note:  The PBOC Monetary 
Committee's 2nd Quarter Report suggested that inflationary pressures 
already were spreading rapidly to other consumer items.  End Note.) 
A PBOC Research Bureau report also estimated that the CPI would 
increase 4.6 percent for 2007 and 5 percent in the first half of 
2008 while GDP would increase 11.6 percent for the year and 10.8 
percent during the first half of 2008. 
 
STOCKS SURGING TO NEW HIGHS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Immediately after the holiday, the stock market again made 
front page news on October 9, breaking the 5700 level and setting a 
new high.  The Shanghai Composite Index opened on October 10 at 5742 
and rose as high as 5860 before dropping to close at 5771.42.  The 
market surpassed 5000 just six weeks ago (Ref D). 
 
PARTY CONGRESS TO OPEN ON OCTOBER 15 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) Inflation remains a predominant domestic economic concern 
as the 17th Party Congress prepares to open on October 15 (Ref E). 
One popular local newspaper in Beijing (Xin Jing Bao) greeted 
readers on October 2 with a special section on prices, demonstrating 
the growing public concern about increasing consumer and asset 
prices.  The articles highlighted both price spikes in consumer 
products (especially food) and rapidly increasing asset prices in 
the housing and stock markets and detailed the impact of price 
increases on urban residents -- by all accounts, a continued 
political concern as the Congress opens.
