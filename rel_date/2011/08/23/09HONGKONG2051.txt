SUBJECT: HONG KONG SECURES H1N1 VACCINE, BUT CONCERNS OVER 
CAPACITY TO INOCULATE 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: Hong Kong health officials announced on 
November 5 that French manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur S.A. won 
the tender to provide Hong Kong with three million doses of 
H1N1 vaccine.  The first 500,000 doses are scheduled to 
arrive in mid-December and the remaining 2.5 million doses in 
January 2010. Health officials expressed concern about the 
capacity of Hong Kong's health care staff to inoculate over 
two million people within a two-month period. END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) Hong Kong health officials announced the conclusion of 
its H1N1 vaccine tender on November 5. French manufacturer 
Sanofi Pasteur S.A. agreed to provide three million doses of 
H1N1 vaccine at HK$79 (approximately US$10.26) per dose, for 
a total price of HK$237 million or US$30.8 million. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Dr. P.Y.Lam, Director of Health and Dr. 
Thomas Tsang, Controller for the Center of Health Protection 
(CHP), one of Hong Kong's main concerns during its vaccine 
tender was timing of delivery. With the H1N1 vaccine shortage 
in the U.S. and other parts of the world, health officials 
felt confident that Sanofi would be able to deliver the doses 
that Hong Kong required within the desired timeframe. 
 
¶4. (U) Hong Kong officials expect to receive the first 
500,000 doses in mid-December and the remaining 2.5 million 
doses in January 2010.  By the end of December, Hong Kong 
plans to provide free vaccinations to five target high-risk 
groups: health care workers, patients with chronic illness 
and pregnant women, children between six months to six years 
old; residents aged 65 and above, and pig farmers and 
slaughterhouse workers. Children aged nine and under would 
receive two doses, while everyone else one dose. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Health officials stated that they planned to use 
public clinics and hospitals for the inoculation program. 
Health officials were also negotiating with private doctors 
to help administer the free shots, but expressed concern 
about the capacity of health care staff to inoculate over two 
million people within a two-month period. They recalled a 
previous mass inoculation effort in 1997 for measles and said 
that the current effort would be "a nightmare." Additional 
temporary staff would be added, they said. Individuals not 
part of one of the target groups would be able to receive 
vaccinations from private physicians for a fee.  Hong Kong 
plans to provide the vaccine to private physicians at cost 
plus administrative fees. 
 
¶6. (U) Health officials stated that Hong Kong was going to 
administer the vaccine in time for the anticipated second 
wave of H1N1 in February to March 2010. Despite the public's 
concern about the timing of the vaccinations, health 
officials believed that by vaccinating high-risk groups in 
December, Hong Kong would be prepared if the second wave 
started earlier in January. Health officials added that if 
the wave struck even earlier, they would have to rely more 
heavily on personal hygiene and social distancing measures 
such as school closures. 
 
¶7. (SBU) When asked about the Hong Kong health officials' 
trip to a mainland Chinese vaccine manufacturer in 
mid-September, Dr. Lam stated that although the Hong Kong 
delegation was "suspicious" at first, the single facility 
that they were shown was advanced and open to sharing 
information about its manufacturing and testing processes. He 
added that even if Hong Kong wanted the mainland vaccine, 
they would not be able to obtain it given the overwhelming 
demand for the vaccine in mainland China.
