REF: STATE 97379 
 
¶1.  We are still trying to arrange a face-to-face discussion on 
Libya's outstanding UNSCR 1267 nominations (reftel) with the 
MFA's International Organizations Affairs office.  The 
combination of Ramadan hours and the absence in New York of the 
leadership of that office has so far frustrated our efforts.  On 
September 17, we sent a diplomatic note transmitting the 
essential points concerning our desire to work with the Libyans 
to resolve the issues surrounding the libyan nominations for the 
1267 list. 
 
¶2.  We will continue to seek a meeting with the relevant Libyan 
officials, but do not think it will occur until after the Id 
al-Fitr ends here on October 3.
