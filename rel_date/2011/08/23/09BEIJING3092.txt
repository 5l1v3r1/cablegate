  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  OBAMA'S VISIT TO ASIA 
 
a. "Barack Obama must make a clear statement on his trade policy" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(11/12)(pg A4): "Aside from climate 
change and promoting global economic recovery, setting a positive 
tone for the overall U.S.-China trade relations will be an important 
topic for Obama's visit to China.  This year the U.S. has initiated 
ten countervailing and anti-dumping investigations against Chinese 
products.  Fred Bergsten at the Peterson Institute for International 
Economics believes that this is not a planned policy of the Obama 
administration.  It happens because of the pressure to create a 
positive trade policy.  A Swiss professor commented that the price 
Obama paid when he sacrificed trade interests in exchange for the 
support of the Worker's Union and the Democrats was very high.  The 
U.S. commercial circle is using this Asia trip as a chance to urge 
Obama to promote regional free trade negotiation.  During his visit 
to Asia, Obama should clarify his trade policy.  The U.S. President 
should make the following statement, 'U.S. trade policy is this...' 
This is what the Asian countries want to hear, because economic 
factors are the driving force behind the relationship between Asian 
countries and the United States." 
 
b. "China should enjoy the right to fair international trade" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(11/12)(pg 2): 
"China should be aware of two facts, about global trade friction: 
first, because of the financial crisis trade protectionism has 
spread worldwide; second, with the U.S. as the obviously leader, 
global trade protectionism mainly targets China.  China must respond 
to the U.S. trade investigations otherwise other countries will 
follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and start their own broad 
investigations about China.  In fact the situation means an end to 
China's economic mode which depends on price advantages.  What's 
more, China needs to adopt a better exchange rate system. Due to the 
depreciation of the U.S. dollar China needs to prepare in order to 
deal with the criticisms concerning China's exchange rate policy. 
In order to enjoy the right to fair international trade, China 
should work towards the removal of any and all discriminative rules 
against it in the WTO.  To fulfill that, China should ask the U.S. 
to recognize China's market economy status during Obama's visit to 
China.  In return, China can also make appropriate compromises on 
import and currency issues." 
 
¶2. JAPAN 
 
"Japan-U.S. relations are still in an adjustment period" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(11/11)(pg 
3): "Japanese experts suggest that Obama will not mention the 
disputable military base and only vaguely ask Japan to abide by the 
U.S.-Japan agreement on U.S. military in Japan.  Japan also thinks 
that Obama's postponed visit to Japan, though reasonable, reflects 
the two country's dispute over the reorganization of U.S. troops in 
Japan.  To some extent, the Democratic Party of Japan and the 
Democratic Party of the United States have many things in common: 
they both face complex, thorny domestic issues.  If any setback 
occurs in U.S.- Japan relations both countries will suffer."
