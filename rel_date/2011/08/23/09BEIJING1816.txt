867 CASES OF 2009 A/H1N1 CONFIRMED 
-------------------- ------------- 
 
¶1.  (U) As of COB July 1, China's Ministry of Health (MOH) has 
officially communicated information about 867 confirmed cases of 
infection by the novel 2009 influenza A/H1N1.  Confirmed cases have 
been detected in 19 provinces and the municipalities of Beijing, 
Chongqing, Shanghai and Tianjin.  Of the 867 confirmed cases, MOH 
reported that as of July 1, 523 infected patients had recovered and 
been released from treatment.  341 infected patients are being 
treated in isolation at local designated hospitals and three others 
are currently being treated in isolation at home. 
 
 
CHINA EASES H1H1 CONTROL MEASURES 
---------------------- ------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to press reports over the last week, the Chinese 
government has adjusted its quarantine and control measures and is 
now allowing some patients infected with the A/H1N1 virus to be 
treated in isolation at home, instead of being moved to or remaining 
in a designated hospital.  Since June 26, MOH has reported a total 
of 14 confirmed A/H1N1 cases receiving treatment at home. 
Previously, home quarantine had been reported only in cases of 
medical observation of close contacts of confirmed cases. 
 
 
CHINA PRODUCES FIRST BATCH OF A/H1N1 ANTIVIRAL DRUG 
--------------------------- ----------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Local press announced on June 26 that Shanghai 
Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd (Shanghai Pharm) had produced China's 
first batch of an antiviral drug to treat patients infected by the 
A/H1N1 influenza virus.  The antiviral drug, Oseltamivir Phosphate 
Capsules, is the Chinese version of "Tamiflu" by Swiss drug maker 
Roche Holding.  Shanghai Pharm reportedly is one of only two Chinese 
companies authorized by Roche to produce the Tamiflu-like drug.
