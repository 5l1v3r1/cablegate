SUBJECT:  Secretary Chu Discusses Energy and Climate Change 
Cooperation with Chinese Academy of Sciences President LU Yongxiang 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Secretary Chu met with Chinese Academy of Sciences 
(CAS) President LU Yongxiang on July 15 to discuss current and 
upcoming areas of cooperation in the areas of energy efficiency and 
climate change. Secretary Chu stressed the need for energy-efficient 
technologies such as efficient buildings, while LU said he hopes 
cooperation can increase in the areas of climate change and also 
health care research. Both agreed work needs to be done not only to 
research energy efficiency and climate change issues, but also to 
quickly get usable solutions to market. End Summary. 
 
COOPERATION, NEW AND OLD 
---------------------- 
¶2.  (U) LU Yongxiang began the meeting by thanking Secretary Chu for 
his visit and said he feels energy issues and climate change are the 
two big challenges of this era. He pointed out that US-China 
cooperation in science goes all the way back to the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the two countries. He stressed the need 
to continue the exchange of scholars and scientists and suggested 
the possibility of signing a general framework of cooperation that 
could include energy issues and healthcare. 
 
¶3.  (U) Secretary Chu agreed that science transcends international 
boundaries and that the US-China relationship in dealing with energy 
and climate change is very important. He noted that the rest of the 
world will follow the example of the US and China when it comes to 
efforts to mitigate climate change. If the US and China move 
together, strongly, in the right direction, the rest of the world 
will follow.  The US intends to lead in this effort. As part of that 
effort, he said the Department of Energy (DOE) is announcing the 
creation of a USD 15 million Joint Energy Research and Development 
Cooperation Center between the Chinese Ministry of Science and 
Technology (MOST), the National Energy Administration (NEA), CAS, 
and the US Department of Energy (DOE) during his visit.  The goal 
will be to mutually develop ideas that can make it all the way to 
market - for example, energy efficient buildings that use 80 percent 
less energy than they do today.  He stressed that the US and China 
need to co-develop new energy and energy efficiency technologies so 
both countries will own the intellectual property rights and can 
deploy the new technology throughout our respective countries. 
 
STAY ON TARGET 
--------------- 
¶4.  (U) Secretary Chu noted that CAS and the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory (PNNL) are already cooperating on carbon capture 
and sequestration technology, coal-to-liquid fuel and gasification 
technology, and modeling energy efficiency.  He said both sides 
needed to take a closer look at this cooperation and possibly 
include it under the new Joint Energy Research and Development 
Cooperation Center to avoid duplication of efforts. 
 
¶5.  (U) LU mentioned that both sides need to decide which areas to 
focus on and establish long-term projects that include not only the 
technology breakthroughs, but also how to implement that technology. 
Secretary Chu agreed that this is important especially in the 
climate change area and that we need to be faster in getting from 
concept to "in field" use. 
 
¶6.  (U) Secretaries Chu did not have an opportunity to review this 
report before departing Beijing.
