¶1. (SBU) Summary: Per reftel requests, AIT/T econoff visited the two 
subject companies, Evergo Instruments Incorporated (EII) and Evergo 
Microwave Incorporated (EMI), which are both located at the same 
address, and are headed by a husband-and-wife team. The information 
collected demonstrates the bona fides of the subject brokers.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Evergo Microwave was established in 1994, and Evergo 
Instruments in 1989.  EII President Samuel S.S. Liao is the husband 
of EMI head Mary Lu Liao.  The registration information for both 
companies, including contact numbers and addresses, matches the 
information included in the database of the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs Bureau of Foreign Trade. The combined Evergo companies have 
offices in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung.  In total, Evergo 
companies have 17 employees. [Note: we were not able to talk with 
Mr. Liao in person because he is a professor of engineering at Feng 
Chia University, and lives in Taichung Monday through Friday. End 
note.] 
 
¶3. (SBU) Both companies import commodities from the U.S. to supply 
customers in Taiwan only.  Ms. Liao said because the companies have 
had more difficulties and delays in receiving export licenses from 
the U.S. over the past three years, they have tried to reach out to 
Europe for additional suppliers.  However, according to Liao, due to 
corporate culture problems and differing regulations, Evergo 
companies have not been able to serve successfully as an agent in 
Taiwan for European manufacturers. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The two Evergo companies handle commercial and military 
items.  Their commercial customers are public sector organizations, 
schools, and private-sector testing labs.  Their military-sector 
clients are in almost all cases the Chung Shan Institute of Science 
and Technology (CSIST) or the Aerospace Industrial Development Corp 
(AIDC).  Ms. Lu stated that she thoroughly understands USML 
regulations. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In most cases, the Evergo companies receive and then store 
commercial and military-use items in the companies' warehouse for a 
period of time ranging from a few days to a week before delivering 
the items to end users.  The Evergo companies also provide 
maintenance services at each of their three offices.  The Taipei 
offices of EII and EMI are co-located in a gated office building 
that has a 24-hour guard.  The EII/EMI office itself is also 
equipped with an alarm system. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Post has no derogatory information in its records 
concerning the two subject brokers.  However, we learned through our 
Taiwan law-enforcement sources that Ms. Liao was prosecuted but 
acquitted for fraud in 1989.  She was also investigated but not 
charged for violating the Government Procurement Law in 2008 and for 
forgery in 2009.  Mr. Liao was also investigated but not indicted 
for forgery in 2009, and is currently under investigation by the 
Taoyuan District Court for another forgery case. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment: Accusations of fraud, forgery, and other 
business-related crimes are very common in Taiwan, and because 
neither broker has been convicted of any crimes, we believe this 
information does not call into question the bona fides of the two 
brokers. End comment.
