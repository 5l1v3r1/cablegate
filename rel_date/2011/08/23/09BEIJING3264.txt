  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
a. "The world sets its eyes on Copenhagen" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(12/07)(pg 
13): "Many people describe the Copenhagen Conference as the last 
chance to save the globe.  For Bangkok and cities in the neighboring 
area, climate change has become a matter of survival.  In India, 
local people's concern over protecting the tropical rain forests in 
fact matters to their survival and employment.   An Indian professor 
said that people have to make actions at once, giving a broad 
consideration of environmental protection, even if personal 
interests would be sacrificed.  Wang Gengchen, a researcher at the 
Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
stressed that climate change negotiations go far beyond climate 
science.  Developing countries' rights need not to be ignored and 
developed countries should help developing countries by providing 
more funds and technologies." 
 
b. "The U.S. factor spells doom for the Copenhagen Climate Change 
Conference" 
 
The official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (Zhongguo 
Qingnianbao)(12/07)(pg 5): "Quite a few climate experts argue that 
China and the United States' commitments to climate change targets 
are not enough to make up the difference between developed and 
developing countries.  Because the United States still has not made 
any progress in combating climate change, expectations for the 
United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen should not be 
high. The U.S. commitment to emissions reduction is indispensable 
for reaching a new global climate change treaty.  However, the 
U.S.'s announced goal of emissions reduction is far removed from its 
role as the world's super power.  What's even more worrying is that 
such a disappointing goal may not be passed by the U.S. Congress. 
Regarding the mid-term election, senators opposing the bill will 
unlikely compromise.  At the same time, the carbon tariff bill in 
the process of gaining approval from the U.S. Congress is in fact 
trade protection measures in the name of environmental protection. 
The impasse has yet to be broken.   Therefore prospects for the 
Copenhagen Conference are dim." 
 
¶2. AFGHANISTAN 
 
"To increase troops in Afghanistan, the U.S. seeks Wakhan corridor" 
 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/07)(pg 8): "Experts believe that logistic 
supplies are crucial for increasing troops in Afghanistan. 
Regarding the important geographical locations of China and Russia, 
it will be critical to see whether the two countries can stay 
outside the U.S. plan for increasing troops in Afghanistan.  Chinese 
military expert Peng Guangqian said that it is hard to deliver 
transport supplies to U.S. troops in Afghanistan through the Wakhan 
Corridor since China-NATO military cooperation is still at an 
initial phase.  It is even more "impossible" that China would send 
combat troops to Afghanistan.  The U.S. will have to stop its 
efforts to try to pull China down into the water." 
 
¶3. NORTH KOREA 
 
"What's the harm if the U.S. takes one step back on the North Korea 
nuclear issue?" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/07)(pg 14): "The U.S. is unwilling to 
leave the world with the impression that it started to have talks 
with North Korea due to pressure from North Korea.  In fact, only 
when the U.S., as the big country, takes the lead and makes 
adjustments (to its strategy) will a turning point on the nuclear 
issue arrive.  If the U.S. can compromise first, a process of mutual 
trust could be established.  In fact these compromises can be undone 
if North Korea refuses to compromise after the U.S.'s compromise. 
Obviously in that way North Korea will receive a more severe 
punishment, of which it can't bear the consequence.  Even if North 
Korea completely gives up its nuclear programs, capacity to possess 
nuclear technology can't now be taken away.  At this point, the U.S. 
long-term strategy should be to compromise first.  In fact, in 
history, although the U.S. has not benefited much from compromising, 
the truth is that the U.S. did not make real compromises at all. 
The U.S. policy for the future should be based on solving issues 
instead of just being conciliatory.  North Korea, at the same time, 
should also take the initiative to make active reactions."
