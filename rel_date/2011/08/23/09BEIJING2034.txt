¶1. SECRETARY CHU AND LOCKE VISIT 
 
"The new growth point for China- U.S. relationship" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (07/17): 
"The announcement of plan to develop a joint energy research center 
marked the first substantive outcome of China-U.S. energy 
negotiations since early this year. Energy cooperation has great 
potential and offers opportunity for overcoming some long-existing 
obstacles in bilateral trade.  The Obama administration's 
unprecedented interference in new energy shows that the U.S. has 
made renewable energy the new engine of growth and economic 
competence.  The U.S. and China each has its needs and advantages in 
the energy field.  China is a huge market for America's high 
technology.  The joint energy research center is a new exploration 
and practice, and hopefully it might be a breakthrough in U.S.'s 
export restrictions on technology to China.  It is a good start for 
broader cooperation on energy between the two countries.  The 
China-U.S. energy cooperation will become an indispensable part of 
the global effort to combat climate change." 
 
¶2. XINJIANG 
 
"Where does "Xinjiang Independence" groups' money come from?" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/17): "Peng Guangqian, a major general in 
the People's Liberation Army and a strategist for the Academy of 
Military Science, said that the information of any individual or 
organization that supports "Xinjiang Independence Groups" should be 
made public.  China can also monitor their cash flow.  China will 
have a "blacklist" of these organizations and individuals, they will 
also be sanctioned.  Pan Zhiping, a researcher from Xinjiang Academy 
of Social Sciences stated that the activities of some "Xinjiang 
separatists" are acts of terrorism therefore they should be dealt as 
terrorists.  China urgently needs an anti-terrorism law, he also 
said.  An anonymous source said, overseas "Xinjiang separatists" are 
more sophisticated in covering their identities and once they have 
legal identity and gain access to foreign banks it will be very 
difficult to investigate their bank accounts and funds. " 
 
¶3. RIO TINTO 
 
"Rio Tinto spy case is a warning to China's economic security" 
 
The official Communist Youth League newspaper China Youth Daily 
(Zhongguo Qingnianbao) (07/17): "Chinese experts and press's 
discussions on Rio Tinto case have gone beyond spying, mainly 
focusing on China's economic security.  We don't need to exaggerate 
the impact of the case; however, we can definitely see the tough 
environment for China's economic security.  China's economic 
security has the following features: the first one is a very odd 
phenomenon, which is that information in the economic field is 
rarely treated as classified.  On the other hand, things that are 
not intelligence-worthy or even out-of-date are kept as top-secrets 
in China.  Second, foreign companies influence decision making 
through seminars arranged by their chambers of commerce in China. 
Chief representatives of multi-national companies is another channel 
to collect intelligence they need.  Foreign firms even seek 
government officials to advocate their interests.  Third, since the 
West controls the rules of international economic activities, many 
Chinese firms have to hire foreign financial service providers in 
order to enter overseas market.  As a result, core data and plans 
are revealed."
