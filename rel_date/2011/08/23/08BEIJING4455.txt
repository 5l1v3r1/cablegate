  Editorial Quotes

¶1. TIBET 
 
"China warns Sarkozy again" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/05): "The Chinese government has made it's 
stand known concerning the French President's meeting with the Dalai 
Lama. China - Europe relations are undergoing a severe test. China 
has explained their bottom line concerning the Dalai. If Sarkozy 
continues to step over the line, he will face the strength of China. 
Chinese experts indicate that Sarkozy's insistence to meet the Dalai 
at the present time has seriously damaged the China-France 
relations, which was already damaged before the Olympics. Both the 
two countries' economic and trade relations will be influenced. The 
Chinese government has given Sarkozy and the French people a lot of 
chances. Sarkozy's behavior has harmed the feelings of the Chinese 
government and its people. Right now, when France is impacted by the 
financial crisis, Sarkozy should think and then act. The Dalai has 
been a trouble maker in the International Society. However, where 
China's interests are concerned, 'the Western countries that lift 
stones in order to throw them at China, will only drop them on their 
own feet', paying the price for their action." 
 
¶2. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"Don't deny the market system because of the financial crisis" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/05): "The Chinese Government has issued a 
4 trillion Yuan plan to stimulate the economy. It will undoubtedly 
strengthen people's confidence in the economy and prevent its 
further downward slide. However, because of the break-out of the 
financial crisis, public opinion has been inclined towards denying 
the market system. The markets went wrong. This doesn't mean that 
there is anything wrong with their foundation. One should not simply 
deny the market system. This amount of large-scale investment was 
bound to be punished by the market because it wasn't concerned about 
restrictions. The root cause of this financial crisis is not the 
market system itself, but the lack of effective supervision of the 
market. Many people seek a Keynesian resolution. However, Keynesian 
is not omnipotent. When the market doesn't work, it is the 
government's job to influence and correct it. However, the obsession 
with Keynesian's presupposition that whatever the Government's 
decision is -- is correct is, most of time, not the right decision. 
The Government's decisions do not always solve the problem. 
Sometimes they cause more damage than the damage caused when the 
market initially went wrong."
