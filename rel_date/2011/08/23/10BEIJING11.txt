  Editorial Quotes

¶1. CHINA POLICY 
 
"China and its neighbors should build a wealth zone on the land" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(01/05)(pg 2):"The China-ASEAN free trade area 
will significantly reduce this region's dependence on Western 
markets and capital and 1.9 billion people will benefit. The free 
trade area is one fruitful result from China's good-neighborly 
relations with neighboring countries.  From a security point of 
view, unlike Africa or Latin America, China's neighboring areas are 
out of U.S. control and hegemony in the sea.  If managed carefully, 
any results China will achieve in this region will be easily 
maintained. The United States, the greatest sea power, would like 
the world's wealth to flow along with the oceans.  But the oceans 
are not of the highest importance to China's interests.  China, a 
traditional land power, should promote all kinds of cooperative 
zones with its neighbors, such as China-Pakistan free trade area, 
China- North East Asia free trade area and China- Russia- Central 
Asia free trade area." 
 
¶2. U.S. POLICY 
 
"Will Yemen become the next counterterrorism 'battlefield'?" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper, 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(01/05) (pg 
2):"Since the Christmas terror attempt, President Obama never 
formally discussed whether or not the United States will intervene 
in Yemen.  Obama was trying to bide his time before making any 
decisions.  Therefore, unfortunately, U.S. intelligence services 
have become the target of public criticism.  In fact, although U.S. 
security has done a pretty good job, as long as the work is done by 
humans, 100% security cannot be guaranteed.  Since the president was 
elected, Barack Obama has always stressed the need to 'change,' 
suggesting that the United States should extend an olive branch 
rather than resort to war.  Obama, who was just awarded the Nobel 
Peace Prize, found himself embarrassed to have to send troops to 
Afghanistan, not to mention that the United States is now heavily in 
debt.  It is not easy for Obama to start a third war in Yemen.  But 
if he chose not to do anything, he will inevitably be criticized by 
the Republican Party, which will consequently affect the mid-term 
elections at the end of this year.  Let us put aside the fact that 
the United States has been overstretched financially and militarily. 
 More troublesome that Yemen is just as much of a muddy quagmire as 
Iraq and Afghanistan, which, once entered, and cannot easily be 
left.  At present, the issue of how to deal with Yemen is a fairly 
disturbing issue for Obama.  Obama's olive branch is about to 
wither." 
 
¶3. AFGHANISTAN 
 
"We should use Afghanistan as a strategic tradeoff" 
 
The international news commercial publication of the People's Daily, 
Global Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/05) (pg 14):"The United States is 
seeking China's help to deal with Afghanistan, which indicates that 
future China-U.S. relations may develop into a strategic 
partnership.  Cooperation makes China happy but we should also stay 
aware of the fact that the U.S. 'containing China' policy has not 
fundamentally changed.  Afghanistan may become the new United States 
strategic platform to contain China.  When helping the United States 
get out of their predicament in Afghanistan, since China has been 
already tied to the United States on multiple strategic issues, is 
China tying itself up again?  If the United States really wants 
China to help in Afghanistan, it must make compromises, to at least 
some extent, on strategic issues including Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan, 
and so on.  The United States must make a clear commitment to 
withdraw U.S. and NATO troops out of Afghanistan once the war 
finishes."
