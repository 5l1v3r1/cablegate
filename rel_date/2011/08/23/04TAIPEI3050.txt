REF: STATE 171566 
 
¶1. In response to our letter to TECRO on August 12 
requesting information on Taiwan's policy on purchase and re- 
export of Cuban sugar, we received the reply from the Board 
of Foreign Trade (BOFT). 
 
¶2. Below is the text of BOFT response from Director General 
Huang Chih-peng. 
 
¶3. Begin text. 
 
Your office's letter addressed to TECRO of August 12, 2004, 
requesting a written verification that Taiwan does not 
import Cuban sugar for re-export to the United States, was 
forwarded to this Bureau for reply. 
 
Let me start by stating that this Bureau is delighted to 
hear that the United States government has granted Taiwan 
the tariff-rate quota of 12,636 metric tons of raw cane 
sugar for the period October 1, 2004-September 30, 2005. 
Please rest assured that we know the United States prohibits 
the importation of Cuban sugar into the United States.  We 
will take appropriate measures to guarantee that your 
regulations are not violated. 
 
For your information, under Taiwan's current administration 
system, an import permit would still be required for 
importing any merchandise from Cuba, including any form of 
sugar.  According to our statistics, Taiwan has never 
imported sugar or sugar products from Cuba in the past.  We 
would also like to affirm that Taiwan will not import Cuban 
sugar for re-export to the United States. 
 
Moreover, as Taiwan Sugar Corporation is the sole 
manufacturer of sugar in Taiwan, we can also affirm that 
Taiwan Sugar Corporation will continue to be the certifying 
authority.  Attached please find a copy of the statement 
from Taiwan Sugar Corporation which certifies that they only 
export sugar of Taiwan origin to the United States and do 
not import Cuban sugar for re-export to the United States. 
 
Please feel free to contact us again if you have any further 
questions.
