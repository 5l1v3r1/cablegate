REF: A) USDOC 04622 B) GBS 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information 
provided below is prohibited by Section 12C of the 
Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of 
the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the 
USDOC Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), 
Regional Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted a post shipment-verification (PSV) at 
Wintech Microelectronics Co. Ltd., 25 Serangoon 
North Ave. 5, No. 05-001, Singapore (Wintech). 
The items in question were three programmable 
logic arrays exported to Wintech on or about April 
12, 2007 and valued at USD 15,435.  On the 
applicable shippers export declaration (SED), the 
items were classified as 3A001 and are most likely 
controlled for national security (NS) reasons. 
The exporter was Altera Corporation of San Jose, 
California. 
 
¶3.  According to the Singapore companies registry, 
Wintech has been in existence since 2001.  Its 
paid-up share capital is the Singapore equivalent 
of USD one million.  Singapore national, Mr. Yang 
Kwang Han and Taiwanese nationals Wen-Sung Cheng 
and Wen-Hung Hsu are listed as directors.  Wintech 
Investment Co. Ltd. is listed as the sole 
shareholdler. 
 
¶4.  On June 20, 2007, the ECO met with several 
Wintech staff members including Ms. Karen Seah, 
Senior Logistics Executive, Ms. Crystal Wan, 
Accountant and Ms. Emily Lim, ISA Supervisor.  ECO 
was accompanied by Kevin Boo of Singapore Customs 
for this PSV.  Ms. Seah stated that the company 
has been in existence since 2001 in Singapore and 
is an affiliate of Taiwanese publicly listed 
company, Wintech (more information at 
www.wtmec.com).  Ms. Seah further stated that, 
worldwide, Wintech has about 900 staff and 
approximately USD 35 million in turnover.  It is a 
distributor of electronic components including IC 
products for use in production of mobile phones 
and other electronic products.  The company 
services the South Asia market including mainland 
China, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and 
India. 
 
¶5.  As to the specific items in question, 
documents provided by Wintech indicate that the 
customer was SM Electronics, a South Korea based 
reseller.  Ms. Seah was unaware of the end-user of 
the items since, she stated, this was a customer 
of the Hong Kong Wintech office.  A review of the 
documents suggested that Wintech paid USD 15,435 
for the items but sold them for USD 10,500.  By e- 
mail, a Michelle Huang from Wintech in Taiwan 
subsequently clarified that the customer had 
requested a discount for the items and Altera 
agreed to reimburse Wintech for the discounted 
amount.  Ms. Huang further stated that the end- 
user of the items is ETRI (a Korean government R&D 
center) for the Altera product (more information 
about ETRI can be found at www.etri.re.kr). 
 
¶6.  The ECO provided background information on BIS 
reexport controls to Wintech and stressed that 
such controls apply to U.S. origin items that 
Wintech resells. 
 
¶7.  At the time visited, Wintech appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the commodities shipped (as 
reseller) since Wintech cooperated with the PSV 
and provided all requested information concerning 
the final disposition of the applicable items.  At 
the same time, the ECO was not able to inspect the 
subject items as they had already been delivered 
to Wintech's customer.  Consistent with guidance 
on reporting of PSVs where the items cannot be 
physically inspected, the ECO recommends that this 
PSV be classified as Limited.
