not be a part of the Chinese delegation to the UPU 
Congress.  On July 3, MFA informed post that an MFA

¶4. (SBU) Lin told emboffs that China advocates "mutual 
support" for the United States and Chinese candidacies 
to the UPU Council of Administration (CA) and Postal 
Operations Council (POC).  He also said the United 
States and China are both very important to the CA and 
POC because the United States represents developed 
countries and China represents the concerns of 
developing countries.  Lin requested United States 
support for China's candidate for the position of 
Deputy Director General of the UPU International 
Bureau. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On the UPU mission statement, SPB noted that 
the core UPU mission statement should not be changed, 
but advocated that appropriate wording should be found 
to reflect changes in global economic developments. 
SPB also said an increase in the budget would have 
negative consequences, agreed with having zero growth, 
but refrained from using the word "nominal," even when 
pressed on the point.  Lastly, SPB did not oppose 
extrabudgetary groups but said their work program 
should not conflict with activities of the UPU 
Secretariat. 
 
¶6. (U) Additionally, SPB informed post that SPB 
Administrator Mr. Ma Junsheng would lead the Chinese 
delegation, which will include over 30 people. 
Individuals from the postal group company of Hong Kong 
and Macao will join the delegation as well as an

MFA official attached to China's diplomatic mission in 
Geneva.

about the United States delegation.  (Comment: It is 
possible that the Chinese delegation may want to 
interact with the United States delegation at 
anticipated events or receptions during the Congress.
