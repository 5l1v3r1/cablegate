¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a pre-license check (PLC) at the Hong Kong Marine Department, Rm. 
2411, 24th Floor, Harbour Building, 38 Pier Road, Central, Hong Kong 
(Marine Department). The PLC concerned 33 internet firewall hardware 
and software products.  The license applicant is Juniper Networks of 
Sunnyvale, California.  The items are classified under ECCN 5A002 
and are controlled for national security reasons (NS). 
 
¶3.  Hong Kong Marine Department is a Hong Kong government 
instrumentality.  More information at: (http://www.mardep.gov.hk/). 
It has five major sections including Planning and Services, Port 
Control, Multilateral policy, Shipping and Government Fleet.  It has 
more than 1000 employees and is responsible for all navigational 
matters in Hong Kong and the safety standards of all classes and 
types of vessels. 
 
¶4. On February 28, 2008, the ECO and Commercial Assistant Carrie 
Chan visited the Marine Department and met with Mr. Kenneth YK Siu, 
Senior Information Technology Officer.  Mr. Siu provided a general 
overview of the Marine Department (consistent with information on 
the Marine Department's web site). 
 
¶5.  Mr. Siu was a bit surprised by the visit in that the Marine 
Department had ordered one of the items (a Juniper SSG 140) in 
October 2007 and had finally received it just one week before the 
ECO's visit.  That item was shipped under license number D387447 and 
Mr. Siu provided documentation confirming delivery of that item and 
confirming that the Marine Department will comply with the relevant 
license conditions.  He stated that there are no other pending 
orders for Juniper products.  ECO surmises that the exporter has 
applied for an export license for a range of products on the 
possibility that a future order will materialize (and, if so, the 
license lead time will be much reduced). 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, ECO found Mr. Siu to be both cooperative 
and credible and observed nothing that would suggest that Hong Kong 
Marine Department is an unsuitable recipient of the items that are 
the subject of License D390721.  OEA may wish to confirm with the 
license applicant ECO's conclusion that this license was filed to 
have a license in place to cover potential future orders.
