ALL EYES ON MUTHARIKA AS HE DEPARTS FOR AU SUMMIT 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U)  Out in full force to cover President Bingu wa Mutharika's 
28 January departure for the upcoming AU summit in Addis Ababa, 
Malawi media is squarely focused on an anticipated showdown between 
Mutharika and Libya's Muammar al-Quadhafi over the AU Chairmanship. 
Leading headlines read "Gadaffi Plots Against Bingu" and "Bingu, 
Gadaffi Collide at AU."  Prominent newspaper The Daily Times quoted 
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Augustine Mtendere as saying, 
"We know that it is Malawi's turn.  If Gadaffi wants to hold on to 
the chairmanship, we have nothing to do with that.  It is wrong for 
him to stick to the chair."  Referring to rumored donations by 
Libya to other AU members in order sway their votes, Mtendere said 
"We can't join that game because of money.  We will play the game 
of rules; we will not play the game of money." 
 
 
 
BAIL FOR SAME-SEX COUPLE DENIED AGAIN 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U)  The Blantyre High Court denied the latest bail request 
from same-sex trial defendants Tiwonge Chimbalanga and Steven 
Monjeza on January 28.  The couple made the request in response to 
the denial by the lower Blantyre Magistrate Court of an earlier 
application (ref A).  In making the ruling, High Court Judge 
Rowland Mbvundula echoed the reasoning behind the prior refusal in 
that "releasing the couple would endanger their safety and induce a 
sense of shock or outrage among the public."  The trial is 
scheduled to resume after 1 February. 
 
 
 
MALAWI'S PARLIAMENT BACK AT WORK 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Malawi's National Assembly got back to work after 
President Mutharika opened the new session on 26 January.  The 
opening of the 42nd Session of Parliament was marked by a forty 
minute State of the Union Address from Mutharika entitled "The 
Dream Come True" where he catalogued his administration's gains in 
economic development and food security for the country.  The 
president strongly noted China's support of several concessionary 
projects in Malawi, including an international conference center, a 
five-star hotel and twenty Presidential villas in Lilongwe, but 
failed to express gratitude for the efforts of Malawi's other 
development partners.  Observers were quick to point out that 
Mutharika did not address Malawi's recent forex woes and fuel 
shortages (ref B).  Some opposition party members went so far as to 
dismiss the speech as a mere "repetition of last year's statement. 
"  United Democratic Front House Leader Ibrahim Matola was quoted 
 
LILONGWE 00000080  002 OF 002 
 
 
as saying "There are many loopholes in that speech and we look 
forward to finding out how government will respond on those 
issues."  Parliament plans to be in session for three weeks. 
 
 
 
MCP MP'S PROMPTLY WALK OUT 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Drama unfolded on the first full day of the new 
parliament on 27 January when tempers flared over the seating plan 
for opposition MPs.  Still smarting from controversial standing 
rule changes passed in the body's last session (ref C), eight 
Malawi Congress Party (MCP) members chose to walk out rather than 
sit behind the ruling party's hand-picked Leader of the Opposition 
Abele Kayembe.  When the MCP members refused to budge after being 
ordered by Speaker Chimunthu Banda to take their assigned seats, 
Banda summoned the sergeant-at-arms to forcibly remove the eight. 
Highlighting the deep fissures in Malawi's main opposition party, 
the members then followed MCP boss (and losing presidential 
candidate) John Tembo out of the chamber.  Cooler heads prevailed 
the next day when the MCP MP's took their assigned seats. 
 
 
 
WEDDING BELLS FOR THE PRESIDENT 
 
 
 
¶6.  (U)  It is now official:  President Mutharika will tie the knot 
with former Minister of Tourism and Wildlife Callista Chapola 
Chimombo.  Ending several months of speculation over the 
relationship between widower Mutharika and widow Chimombo, a 
statement from State House announced that the two will be engaged 
in a traditional ceremony on Valentine's Day (February 14) and then 
walk to the altar on Malawi Labour Day (May 1).  Malawi media and 
the public had been abuzz after several recent public events where 
Chimombo was seated next to or near the President.  Speculation 
increased when in December, in an apparent breach of protocol, the 
future first lady was seated next to Mutharika while Malawi's Vice 
President Joyce Banda occupied the third seat over.  Chimombo was 
also recently named Malawi's High Commissioner to Zimbabwe, but it 
is unclear whether she still plans to take up the position.
