¶1. (U) Summary:  The number of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) 
infections in south China continues to rise, though authorities 
claim that the pace is slowing.  In the past two weeks, Guangdong's 
reported HFMD cases have risen to 23,278, resulting in seven deaths. 
 The current number has far surpassed original predictions of around 
10,000 cases by year's end (ref B).  Fujian and Guangxi have not 
released updated data on infections in the past week and a half. 
Cases in Hainan province number 654, with no new deaths.  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Guangdong - Infections Increase, Rate Slows 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) As of May 20, Guangdong has reported a total of 23,278 HFMD 
infections.  According to Huang Fei, Deputy Director of the 
Guangdong Health Department, a total of 21 cities and 119 counties 
in Guangdong have reported HFMD cases, of which Guangzhou, Shenzhen, 
Foshan, Dongguan, and Maoming are among the most affected.  Of the 
reported cases, 203 have been confirmed as EV 71 infections, up from 
63 as of May 12.  Only those patients who have made specific 
requests, or those cases deemed to be 'critical,' are tested for EV 
71 due to a lack of capacity and available reagents.  Thus far, the 
hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreaks have lead to seven deaths 
(two in Foshan and one each in Guangzhou, Zhanjiang, Maoming, 
Dongguan and Meizhou). Authorities have confirmed that six of the 
deaths were caused by EV 71 infections. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Statistically, 88.9% of the cases reported in Guangdong are 
children five years-old and younger. 
Although the numbers of cases are increasing, according to Deputy 
Director Huang, the latest figures suggest that the rate of 
infection is slowing.  Huang said daily reports indicate that the 
HFMD infection rate reached its peak on May 8.  Guangdong CDC 
officials are hopeful that the number of cases will not reach 30,000 
by the end of the year.  Zhang also said that health authorities 
have not detected any new mutations or variations in the EV 71 
strain during this year's outbreaks. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Guangxi and Fujian - Lack of Up-To-Date Reporting 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Updated HFMD statistical data in both Guangxi and Fujian 
provinces have not been released to the public in almost two weeks. 
According to the Guangxi Center for Disease Control (CDC), Disease 
Control Division Chief Geng, the lack of up-to-date reporting is 
largely due to the involvement of relevant officials in Sichuan's 
earthquake relief efforts.  As of May 9, Guangxi had reported 636 
cases, including two deaths.  He assured us that the HFMD situation 
in Guangxi is stable, and stated that the media has placed an undue 
amount of attention on this annually occurring disease.  Geng claims 
that the reason the disease is so prevalent this year is because of 
the high incidence of infection in rural areas, where residents lack 
sufficient access to medical care.  Currently, Guangxi has 
designated 127 hospitals to care for HFMD infections. 
 
¶5. (U) As of May 10, Fujian has reported 1441 cases of HFMD, and no 
deaths.  Fujian has reported that 16 of those cases are linked to EV 
71, while another 4 cases are linked to Coxsakie Virus (Cox A16), 
another virus causing hand, foot, and mouth disease that is often 
asymptomatic in adults. 
 
--------------------- 
Hainan - Three Deaths 
--------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) As of May 19, Hainan authorities have documented 1,100 HFMD 
 
cases up from 654 confirmed one week ago, including three deaths. 
Of these, 46 cases have been identified as EV 71 infections.
