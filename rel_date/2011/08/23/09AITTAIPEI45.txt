REF: STATE 955 
 
¶1. Per reftel request, AIT/T contacted the end user, Taiwan 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (TSMC), and TSMC Principal 
Engineer Kenneth Lin confirmed the details of the reftel business 
transaction. 
 
¶2. Lin told AIT/T that he asked the foreign consignee, Semicaps Pte. 
Ltd., to provide TSMC a sample of an in-GaAs machine.  One of the 
machine's components is an emission microscopy camera used to detect 
integrated circuit faults.    According to Lin, TSMC has to test the 
machine before deciding whether to purchase it from Semicaps. 
 
¶3. Please note the contact phone number in reftel for TSMC's Kenneth 
Lin was not correct.   Mr. Lin can be reached at 886-3-563-6688 ext.
