REF: STATE 346420 
 
¶1.  RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS RAISED PARA 5 REFTEL 
FOLLOW: 
 
¶A.  POST HAS NO RECORD OF ANY CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR OF 
ANY SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM DURING 
THE PAST YEAR. 
 
¶B.  POST HAS NO RECORD OF ANY EXTRADITIONS OR 
ATTEMPTED EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS BY 
THE PRC DURING THE PAST YEAR. 
 
¶C.  THE U.S. DOES NOT HAVE AN EXTRADITION TREATY 
WITH THE PRC.  CHINA HAS IN THE PAST TRANSFERRED 
CRIMINALS TO COUNTRIES WITH WHICH IT DOES NOT HAVE 
AN EXTRADITION TREATY.  CURRENT PRC SENSITIVITY OVER 
THE CASE OF WANG ZONGXIAO -- A CONVICTED NARCOTICS 
TRAFFICKER WHO WAS ALLOWED TO GO TO THE U.S. TO 
TESTIFY IN A NARCOTICS CASE, AND SUBSEQUENTLY FILED 
A CLAIM FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM THAT IS UNDER 
ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW IN THE U.S. -- MIGHT WELL 
AFFECT CHINESE WILLINGNESS TO EXTRADITE SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS. 
 
¶D. RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION:  THE CHINESE 
OFFICIAL POSITION IS THAT THE PRC GOVERNMENT IS 
OPPOSED TO ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM AND DOES NOT 
SUPPORT OR HARBOR TERRORISTS.  THIS POSITION WAS 
MOST RECENTLY REITERATED BY A MINISTRY OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS SPOKESMAN REPLYING TO ALLEGATIONS IN THE 
INDIAN PRESS THAT ASSAMESE TERRORISTS WERE BEING 
TRAINED IN CHINA.  DURING THE GULF WAR THE CHINESE 
GOVERNMENT COOPERATED WITH THE U.S. BY SHARING 
INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, AND 
INCREASED SECURITY AT THE U.S. EMBASSY AND OTHER 
POSSIBLE TARGETS FOR TERRORIST ATTACK. 
 
¶E.  WE ARE NOT AWARE OF PRC PARTICIPATION IN MAJOR 
COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS. 
 
¶F.  THE PRC PUBLICLY OPPOSES TERRORISM.  THE EMBASSY 
HAS NO RECORD OF PRC SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  THERE IS A PLO MISSION IN BEIJING AND 
THE PRC HOSTED A DELEGATION OF PLO LEADERS THIS 
AUGUST. 
 
¶G.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHINESE STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT 
FOR A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM 
ISSUE. 
 
¶H.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE 
PRC'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS TERRORISM OVER THE COURSE OF 
THE PAST YEAR.
