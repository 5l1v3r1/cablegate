  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. U.S. POWER TRANSITION 
 
"U.S. diplomacy steps onto the middle road" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (12/11): 
"There are doubts about various assignment by newly-elected 
President Obama. The members that Obama has selected for the new 
administration are experienced, highly educated and highly capable. 
Therefore, people doubt that they can be dominated. But Obama 
believes personnel with strong personalities holding different 
opinions will be good for policy debates. The goal of Obama's 
administration in foreign policy will be maintaining the U.S. 
security, fixing the U.S. image and keeping the U.S. leadership. 
Analysts think that the Obama Diplomacy will weaken the ideological 
influence and adopt a practical diplomacy that aims at solving 
problems. This practicality, this middle road stance on policy will 
be the most prominent character of Obama's foreign policy." 
 
¶2. GLOBAL TRADE 
 
"To grasp the weakness of France and make it to feel pain" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/11): "The development of U.S.-France 
economic and trade relations is mutually beneficial. If there is a 
trade war, France will have a larger loss than China. Economics and 
Trade are not France's weaknesses. Analysts indicate that a trade 
war won't make France feel the pain. Therefore China and France are 
making troubles concerning economics and trade and will eventually 
cause harm to both countries. However, Africa is the core interest 
of France. France is losing control in currency, as well as French 
and African airlines. France can't live without Africa. If China 
makes and issue of France's mistakes in Africa, France will feel the 
pain." 
 
¶3. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"Fighting the odds" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (12/11): "The 
Central Economic Work Conference that ended yesterday has sounded 
the clarion call for the Chinese economy to press forward in the 
face of unprecedented difficulties. ...Tasks listed high on the 
Government's agenda include efforts to boost domestic demand, 
facilitate industrial restructuring, deepen economic reforms and 
improve people's living standards. The country definitely needs to 
brace for rough times ahead. In the face of daunting challenges, it 
is necessary to keep in mind that the only thing we have to fear is 
fear itself. And the only way to overcome adversities is for all of 
us to rally together with a firm belief in our own strength."
