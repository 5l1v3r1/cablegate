SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused October 15 
news coverage on Taiwan government's decision to cut individuals' 
income tax; on the confession of Yeh Sheng-mao, former Director of 
the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau (MJIB), regarding the 
probe of the former first family's alleged money-laundering; and on 
the United States government's decision to inject US$250 billion to 
buy shares in banks.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, a 
column in the mass-circulation "Apple Daily" criticized the Bush 
administration's North Korea policy as a failure as it let North 
Korea become a member of the nuclear club.  End summary. 
 
"A Nuclear Game" 
 
Columnist Antonio Chiang wrote in his column in the mass-circulation 
"Apple Daily" [circulation: 520,000] (10/15): 
 
"The United States eventually removed North Korea from the list of 
countries which support terrorism.  [United States President George 
W] Bush eventually got out of the embarrassing situation and left 
the mess of the Korean peninsula to his successor.  North Korea's 
Kim Jong-il fooled the United States with his astute negotiation 
strategies and eventually forced the White House to have a showdown. 
 His [Kim's] status of national hero in people's minds was thus 
further consolidated. ... 
 
"North Korea's cooperation with Iran and Syria is the most serious 
issue in the anti-nuclear proliferation effort.  However, the United 
States signing a nuclear cooperation deal with India recently 
created a hypocritical double standard, which made it difficult for 
the United States to speak righteously and sternly to North Korea. 
 
 
"In fact, naming Iran and North Korea as countries in the axis of 
evil was one of Bush's major diplomacy mistakes.  Labeling North 
Korea as [a country] supporting terrorism was problematic in 
itself. 
 
"Now, after making herculean efforts, [the Unites States] took the 
initiative and docilely removed the label for North Korea.  However, 
during the whole process North Korea has joined the nuclear club. 
[The United States'] efforts were all in vain. 
 
"Making one mistake caused mistakes in every subsequent step. 
Bush's anti-terrorism efforts pushed him into a corner and left him 
besieged on all sides.  [Circumstances in] Iran, Afghanistan, and 
Iraq have been difficult to wrap up.  Kim allowing the United States 
to escape an embarrassing situation barely allowed Bush to retain a 
little bit of his legacy in diplomacy, but really brought the 
nuclear game into full play."
