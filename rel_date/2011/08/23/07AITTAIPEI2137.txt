Summary 
------- 
 ¶1. (SBU)  Although Japanese aviation safety authorities are 
still investigating the cause of the fire that destroyed a 
Boeing 737-800 operated by China Airlines (CAL) on August 20, 
Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration has suggested that 
an aircraft design flaw may be behind the incident.  Taiwan 
authorities state CAL has been fully compliant with aircraft 
maintenance and inspection requirements.  Boeing's Taiwan 
representative has expressed concern that this event could 
affect timing of Boeing's sale of its new 787 aircraft to 
CAL.  End Summary. 
 
Dramatic Photos of Plane in Flames 
---------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) On August 20, leaking fuel ignited a fire that 
destroyed a China Airlines (CAL) Boeing 737-800, at Okinawa's 
Naha International Airport.  Although there were no 
casualties among the 157 passengers and eight crew members, 
the extensive media coverage, including spectacular photos of 
the fire and ruined plane, conveyed the impression that CAL 
is still plagued by aircraft safety problems.  Ironically, 
the fire occured just two months after CAL renegotiated its 
liability insurance premium with Taiwan Fire & Marine 
Insurance Co. from USD 18 million to USD 13 million because 
of improvements in CAL's flight safety record over the 
preceding three years. 
 
Taiwan Focuses on a Bolt 
------------------------ 
¶3. (SBU) Lee Wan-lee, Director of the Flight Standards 
Division of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) 
showed AIT Econoff and visiting U.S. Federal Aviation 
Administration Rep on August 31 parts from the CAL Boeing 737 
that his inspectors had brought back from Okinawa.  According 
to Lee, CAA's initial assessment is that the fire was caused 
by a bolt, part of the mechanism used to extend and retract 
the slats on the leading edge of the wing, coming loose and 
puncturing the plane's fuel tank.  The resulting leaking fuel 
was ignited by the heat of the plane's engines.  Lee claimed 
that maintenance and inspection of this particular assembly 
is very difficult because it is not readily accessible.  He 
said CAA issued an air worthiness directive (AD) on August 24 
requiring all Taiwan air carriers to inspect wing slat 
assemblies on Boeing 737-800 aircraft within 20 days.  Lee 
emphasized that CAA issued its AD one day before the U.S. 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued its own AD.  On 
August 28, FAA issued a separate emergency air worthiness 
directive (EAD), requiring inspection of the wing slat 
assemblies within 10 days.  CAA issued a corresponding EAD to 
Taiwan carriers the same day.  In meetings with AIT, CAA and 
CAL representatives have highlighted the actions of the CAL 
flight crew in preventing casualties in the incident and 
CAL's compliance with Taiwan's aircraft maintenance and 
inspection requirements. 
 
¶4. (SBU) CAA Director General Billy Chang (Kuo-cheng), along 
with Lee and other senior technical staff, met with AIT and 
the FAA regional representative on September 7.  Chang 
reviewed CAA's theory about the cause of the plane fire, 
emphasizing that the nuts used to hold the wing slat bolt in 
place are not large enough (implying a design flaw).  Lee 
provided data on eight cases of wing slat bolts (technically 
"slat track stop hardware") on Boeing 737-800s found to be 
loose or disconnected.  He stated the data was provided by 
Boeing, and pertains to cases from January 1999 to July 2007 
involving five different airlines, not including CAL. 
 
¶5. (SBU) CAL completed the inspection of its 13 737-800 
aircraft on September 8, and submitted a report to CAA and 
Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council (ASC) on September 9. 
Although CAL has not made any public statement about the 
inspections, CAA announced that its analysis of the report 
indicated 100 of 208 nuts were insufficiently tight.  Japan's 
Civil Aviation Bureau (CAB), the agency responsible for 
investigating the CAL fire in Okinawa, notified FAA that 
inspection of Boeing 737-800s by Japanese carriers found one 
case of loose slat track stop hardware on a plane where there 
was no record of maintence for that assembly.  The Japan CAB 
 
suggested that a necessary washer which was part of the 
assembly may not have been installed in the manufacturing 
process. 
 
Boeing Worries about Impact on 787 Sale 
--------------------------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) Boeing's Taiwan representative told AIT on September 
12 that because of the CAL fire, it is unlikely that the 
pending purchase of Boeing 787 aircraft by CAL will be 
completed before Taiwan's March 2008 presidential election, 
and may be postponed until some time after the inauguration 
of the next president.  He stated Boeing's senior management 
is exclusively focused on public relations damage control. 
Further, in his view it would be politically untenable for 
President Chen Shui-bian's administration to proceed with the 
purchase.
