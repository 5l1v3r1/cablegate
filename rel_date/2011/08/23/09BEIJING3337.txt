  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
"China's high-profile criticism demonstrates skillful diplomacy" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(12/15)(pg 2): "China's high-profile criticism of 
developed countries will help China gain control in the climate 
negotiations.  The treaty which will be reached at the Copenhagen 
Conference will inevitably influence the low-carbon chain industry 
of the future.  Those who will benefit from these new rules will 
gain control in future industrial competition and interest 
allocations.  The Chinese delegation's high-profile remarks are a 
legal counterattack, not a sentimental action, which is very 
progressive for China.  The Foreign Affairs Ministry has also 
established a specific team to serve foreign and domestic media. 
The Chinese delegation is turning from a victim into a rule-maker 
and a rule-player." 
 
¶2. CHINA MODEL 
 
"Deep thoughts on competition over 'model'" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(12/15)(pg 2): "Wang Yusheng, the Executive 
Director of China Foundation for International and Strategic 
Studies, said that even though the West is trying to woo China by 
saying 'the China model,' we need to be prudent and modest as it 
will not do us any good.  China never agreed to advocate for the 
so-called China model, neither did it puff up any 'universal value.' 
 Some personnel are using these concepts to shoot sugar-coated 
bullets at China.  The G-2 proposal is a tactic by the United States 
to alienate China from other countries." 
 
¶3. TAIWAN 
 
"Countermeasures against the U.S. should not just be a slogan" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/15)(pg 14): "Obama's decision to sell arms 
to Taiwan has become another major 'peaceful' move, following his 
announcement to increase troops in Afghanistan after winning the 
Nobel Peace Prize.  In view of U.S. power politics, if China fails 
to take countermeasures against the U.S., there will not be equal 
and smooth U.S.-China relations in the future.  And as for the 
question of how should China contain the U.S.; China could learn 
from Russia's history, which successfully urged the U.S. to withdraw 
its Missile Defense System from Eastern Europe.  Only when the U.S. 
feels real pain, will it be aware of China's endurance limits. 
Countermeasures, at certain levels that China could take, include 
cancelling certain commercial interests of the U.S., selling arms to 
potential opponents of the U.S. and denying certain strategic 
proposals of the United States.  Since, without China's help, the 
U.S. will experience more frustrations in the world's political an 
mlitry feld, the U.S. dares not completely destroy U.S.-China 
relations. The U.S. can't take China's unwillingness to confront the 
U.S. as the same thing as China fearing to fight against the United 
States.  President Obama should be aware that whoever damages 
China's interests will pay a price for it."
