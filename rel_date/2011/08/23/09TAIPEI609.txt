SUBJECT: TFFLU01: TAIWAN CONFIRMS FIRST H1N1 CASE 
 
REF: TAIPEI 588 AND PREVIOUS 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) On May 20, Taiwan health authorities confirmed the 
first occurrence of H1N1 in Taiwan.  The infected passenger 
arrived on May 18 at 9:30 pm on Cathay Pacific flight CX 468 
from Hong Kong, having started his trip in New York.  The 
52-year-old Australian national had a fever when he arrived 
at Taipei's Taoyuan International airport. He was stopped at 
the temperature monitoring station at the airport, and is 
being treated and quarantined at a hospital in Taoyuan. 
According to reports, the Australian is a long-time resident 
of Taitung, on Taiwan's east coast, and works as a shipboard 
doctor on cruise ships.  His latest cruise was on the 
"Norwegian Dawn", which cruised from New York to Bermuda. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Speculation as to how long Taiwan would be able to 
hold out against the H1N1 virus when neighboring countries 
were all finding cases of the H1N1 virus, ended with the 
diagnosis of this first H1N1 case. Whether this will be just 
an isolated case remains to be seen, as health authorities 
scramble to contain this individual occurrence and wait for 
results from testing passengers who were seated in the 
Australian's proximity on flight CX 468. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) TCDC has managed to track down all 57 passengers 
sitting in the three rows in front and behind the H1N1 
patient on flight CX 468.  It has taken medical samples from 
each of the 57, and urged them to stay home and impose 
self-quarantine procedures while being monitored by medical 
officials.  TCDC is still trying to determine if any 
passengers who sat near the H1N1 patient on the May 17 
non-stop flight from New York to Hong Kong (CX 831) booked 
separate flights to Taiwan. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) TCDC told us it has sent relevant information to 
the IHR focal points in Geneva and the U.S.
