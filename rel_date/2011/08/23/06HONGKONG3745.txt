SUBJECT: SUCCESSFUL EXPORT CONTROL COLLABORATION WITH TID 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On September 12, Export Control Officer (ECO) 
Philip Ankel discussed Hong KongQs successful prosecution 
of an export control case and requested assistance on 
another case during a meeting with Hong Kong Trade and 
Industry Department (TID) Assistant Director-General, Erica 
Ng.  ECO Ankel presented Ms. Ng with a letter from Bureau 
of Industry and Security (BIS) Assistant Secretary for 
Export Enforcement Darryl Jackson addressed to Mr. Clement 
Leung, Acting Director-General, TID, congratulating the 
Hong Kong government for obtaining a conviction of a Hong 
Kong company for violations of Hong Kong's Strategic Goods 
Law.  The conviction of Hong KongQs Mitron Company resulted 
from the unlicensed export of controlled microwave 
amplifiers from Hong Kong to mainland China.  BIS provided 
information to TID, which resulted in the conviction. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ankel also requested follow-up TID assistance in 
another case involving a Hong Kong based company that is 
apparently shipping U.S. origin items to entities of 
concern in Iran.  Specifically, BIS requested assistance in 
determining the final destination of a shipment addressed 
to that company.  U.S. Customs and BIS are currently 
detaining the shipment pending further investigation.  Ng 
expressed a general willingness to help but requested 
additional information about the control status of the 
items in the suspect shipment since TID has limited legal 
authority under Hong Kong law to intervene in matters 
involving goods that are not controlled pursuant to the 
international regime lists.  Ankel stated that BIS is 
working on a licensing determination that will address 
TID's question and will provide the information to TID as 
it becomes available. 
 
¶3.  (U) Finally, Ankel provided TID with the most recent 
BIS licensing data that is regularly exchanged with Hong 
Kong pursuant to the information sharing agreement between 
Hong Kong and BIS.
