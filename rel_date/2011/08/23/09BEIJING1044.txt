¶1. ADMIRAL ROUGHEAD'S VISIT TO CHINA 
 
a. "The U.S. fears China's anti-warship capabilities" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(04/20): "A former 
U.S. chief of naval operations once mentioned that China's research 
into an anti-warship ballistic missile is the largest concern for 
the U.S. in recent years. During the anniversary celebration of the 
Chinese navy, the U.S. has begun to comment on China's military 
threat. In these conversations, China's anti-warship capabilities 
have become a hot topic. It is an old topic. The U.S.' '2008 report 
on China's military strength' stated that China has possessed 
ballistic missiles capable of attacking American aircraft carriers. 
The report in 2009 once again mentioned this issue. The U.S. 
military has upgraded this concern of from 'tactic level' to 
'strategic level'. The U.S. aircraft carrier and combat troops 
possess the 'absolute command over the sea.' However, concerning 
ballistic missiles, the U.S. navy does not yet have the ability of a 
counter attack. This is, in fact, a weakness of the U.S. navy. 
What's more, by emphasizing the threat from the Chinese navy, the 
U.S. navy can obtain more funding and, at the same time, ensure the 
U.S. navy's dominant' position." 
 
b. "The world focuses on China's naval operations; warships from 
fourteen countries gather in Qingdao; the U.S. closely observes the 
Chinese navy" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/20): "U.S. Chief of naval operations, 
Admiral Roughead, held a press conference yesterday at the U.S. 
Embassy in BeijingQe mildly expressed that the U.S. destroyer 
attending the celebrations is one of the most advanced destroyers 
available. Possessing an aircraft carrier is an ambition of the 
Chinese navy. The U.S. will not change their strategy accordingly. 
The U.S. is more concerned with how China will use their aircraft 
carrier and what their end-goal in acquiring the ship is. Chinese 
experts believe there is a big difference between westerners and 
Chinese people concerning the Chinese navy. Western countries worry 
that the rising of the Chinese navy will threaten them. Both the 
Western countries and China have two different value systems when it 
comes to oceanic affairs. Different from China's ethic thinking, 
western countries believe in interests and benefits. The troop 
viewing will manifest China's peaceful and harmonious might. It also 
shows China's confidence and openness." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA TRADE RELATIONS 
 
"China sues American law # 727 in the WTO; Poultry ban" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/20): "Chinese experts suggest that at the 
very beginning, the U.S. and China reached an agreement that the 
U.S. and China would be equals in exporting poultry to the world. 
However, the U.S. has betrayed the rules in this game. This is 
typical trade protectionist behavior. In fact, the exported poultry 
meat by China did not have any problems. China is fighting this 
trade protectionist behavior by appealing to the WTO. In the current 
backdrop of the financial crisis, the U.S. law #727 will definitely 
cause a chain reaction; other industries may imitate it, and it 
provides a negative example. However, the effect on China of law 
NO. 727 is, in fact, limited. The dispute between the two is just an 
independent case. It will not have a large impact." 
 
¶3. BOOK: UNHAPPY CHINA 
 
"With things unpleasant, can't we be unhappy?" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (04/20): "The 
ongoing debate over the book Unhappy China is as amusing and 
controversial as the book itself. What is really intriguing is that 
commentaries published in some influential Chinese newspapers seem 
to dismiss the book as 'too extreme and nationalistic', but netizens 
and scholars not associated with those publications have openly 
supported these authors' views. That means that people who try to 
gauge public opinion on an issue by reading those newspapers, or 
people who assume that they mirror society's view in total, could be 
misled. But if things constantly make us unhappy, I'm afraid 
nationalism - irrespective of how 'dangerous' or 'poisoning' it may 
sound to elitists' ears would require solid ground to prevail in 
this town."
