SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: CHINA'S LAUNCH OF LUNAR EXPLORER 
 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage October 30 on mounting gasoline prices, on the 2008 
presidential election, on the UN referendum, and on the soaring 
stock price index in Taiwan, which reached a seven-year high Monday. 
 In terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the 
pro-unification "United Daily News" discussed China's recent launch 
of the Chang'e lunar explorer.  The article suggested that Taiwan 
pay attention to Beijing's changes in its international and 
cross-Strait strategies.  An editorial in the conservative, 
pro-unification, English-language "China Post" said "[t]he Chang'e 
expedition will drastically increase China's military capability and 
its influence on other countries."  End summary. 
 
A) "Interpreting [the Launch of] Chang'e [Lunar Explorer]:  Taiwan's 
[Cross-Strait Policy] Should Still Focus 70 Percent on Politics and 
30 Percent on Military" 
 
The pro-unification "United Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] 
editorialized (10/30): 
 
"... The launch of the 'Chang'e-1' lunar explorer was in reality a 
prelude to Beijing's plan to build a space station, which will be 
followed up by the establishment of a space command center and 
deployment of space weapons.  What is noteworthy is not the military 
intention behind the 'Chang'e-1' lunar explorer but Beijing's change 
in its international and cross-Strait strategies.  Beijing will no 
longer 'show off its might by saber-rattling;' instead, it has 
started to emphasize its 'soft power' of exploring energy on the 
moon [sic].  But this does not mean that Beijing no longer attaches 
great importance to military development; the two-digit growth in 
China's defense budgets over the past two decades evidently 
indicates its attempt to continue developing its military strength, 
except that it has turned to develop it in a low-profile manner. 
China's successful launch of an anti-satellite missile in early 
2007, making it the third country in the world after the United 
States and Russia to have such capability, as well as its move to 
make public new weapons such as the J10 fighter jets, Type 094 and 
093 nuclear-powered submarines, and the Dongfeng-21 mid-range 
ballistic missiles, have all highlighted that Beijing is also 
expanding its 'hard power' significantly. ..." 
 
B) "China Flying to the Moon" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language "China Post" 
[circulation: 30,000] editorialized (10/30): 
 
"The launch of the lunar explorer Chang'e from the Xichang Satellite 
Launch Centre in southwestern Sichuan province Wednesday garnered 
international media attention as a move that at once heated up the 
space race in Asia and enhanced China's status as a major power. 
... 
 
"China's military has been in charge of the space program from the 
beginning.  The Chang'e expedition will drastically increase China's 
military capability and its influence on other countries.  No 
wonder, in his report to the just concluded 17th National Congress 
of the Communist Party of China, President Hu Jintao surprisingly 
did not threaten to use force against Taiwan, as mandated by a 2005 
Anti-Secession Law, despite Taipei's plan to hold a referendum on 
joining the U.N. as a non-Chinese state."
