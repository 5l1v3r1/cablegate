SUBJECT: TFFLU01: MAY 15 H1N1 VIRUS UPDATE FOR TAIWAN 
 
REF: TAIPEI 515 
 
 ¶1.  Taiwan continues to have close calls with the H1N1 virus 
from arriving airline passengers who have been in proximity 
to H1N1 carriers on their journey. As of noon, May 15, 
however, there are still no confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus 
in Taiwan.  At the CKS International Airport May 12, seven 
passengers who shared the same plane from San Francisco to 
Taipei with a H1N1 carrier were tracked down later.  The 
seven people underwent tests and showed a negative reaction 
to the H1N1 test.  As of noon May 15, 176 cases have been 
monitored and 165 have tested negative for the H1N1 virus. 
The remaining 11 are pending test results. 
 
¶2.  Ministry of Health officials met with AIT on May 13 and 
said they had requested the U.S. CDC provide Taiwan with a 
sample of the vaccine strain of the H1N1 virus (also known as 
"California 5") which they need to develop and produce an 
H1N1 vaccine in Taiwan.  The Minister of Health also asked 
for US FDA assistance in their vaccine certification process. 
 AIT contacted the US FDA, via the Department of State Office 
of Taiwan Coordination, regarding Taiwan's request.  At the 
direction of the U.S. FDA, AIT has provided Taiwan with the 
e-mail address of the Manufacturers Assistance and Technical 
Training Division at FDA, which handles such requests, so 
that Taiwan can submit a written request directly.  Taiwan 
plans to produce 10 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine before 
Fall, to be prepared should the virus return during that 
time.  TCDC hopes to be able to produce enough doses to 
donate for WHO distribution to countries in need. 
 
¶3.  The Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs revised Mexico 
from Red alert status (the most dangerous) to Orange, 
reflecting that H1N1 outbreaks in that country have 
stabilized.  Countries that have been added to the yellow 
alert list with findings of H1N1 cases, include Cuba, 
Finland, Hong Kong, PRC, Canada and the U.S. Currently only 
Mexico is on orange alert and 31 countries are still listed 
in the yellow alert list. 
 
¶4.  At a MOFA sponsored briefing on H1N1, a Ministry of 
Health official told the assembled diplomats that Taiwan will 
not adopt the drastic quarantine policy practiced in Hong 
Kong.  She referred to the first H1N1 case discovered in a 
Hong Kong Hotel which was sealed off with all its current 
occupants for a week. Instead, Taiwan policy would emphasize 
supervised home stay and monitoring for those who had been in 
the proximity of an H1N1 case.  Those exhibiting fever 
symptoms and testing positive for H1N1 would still be 
quarantined at the medical facility treating them. 
 
¶5.  Health authorities are also working with Academia Sinica, 
Taiwan's premier research institute, to learn more about 
pandemics, contagious diseases, virology, culturing of drug 
strains and computer simulation.  If situations warrant, 
these Academia Sinica experts may be asked to help at the 
TCDC's emergency command center.
