SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050095421 
 
REF: BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 2006 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050095421 for the export 
of armored vehicle parts to Taiwan.  AIT/T is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future applications involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: unfamiliar foreign consignee.  Foreign 
consignee Switch Mean's Rentals Co., Ltd. has not appeared on 
any previous license applications, nor has its bona fides 
been confirmed by a Blue Lantern check.  PM/DTCC has been 
unable to verify the existence of the company.  AIT/T should 
make appropriate inquiries to verify the bona fides of Switch 
Mean's Rentals and confirm the legitimacy of the proposed 
transaction. The following questions are provided as 
suggested guidance: 
 
For the Taiwan MOD: 
 
--Are you familiar with Switch Mean's Rentals? 
 
--Did you order from Switch Mean's Rentals the exact type and 
quantity of items listed on this application? 
 
--Who will be actually integrating the parts into M48A5 AVLB 
armored vehicles? 
 
--Is Switch Mean's Rentals an official supplier/contractor 
for the Taiwan MOD?  Does the Taiwan MOD have any other 
contracts with the company? 
 
For Switch Mean's Rentals: 
 
--Does the company have proper supporting documentation, 
including purchase orders from the Taiwan MOD, for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--Who will be actually integrating the parts into M48A5 AVLB 
armored vehicles? 
 
--Will the company be handling or storing the items listed on 
the application?  If so, does it have secure facilities and 
proper accounting and security procedures for handling these 
sensitive USML items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what types of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What types of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
¶4. Department requests that AIT/T conduct a site visit to the 
company in order to provide Department with an assessment of 
its business operations and on-site security.  If a site 
visit is not possible, please inform PM/DTCC case officer. 
Finally, AIT/T is asked to assess whether the company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  End action.
