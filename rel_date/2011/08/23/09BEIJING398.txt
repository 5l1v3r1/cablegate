Secretary of State Visit 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. China has "noted" Secretary of State Clinton's recent speech on 
U.S. policy toward Asia, said MFA spokesperson Jiang Yu at the 
February 17 Ministry of Foreign Affairs press conference. Jiang said 
that the speech "stressed that the United States is ready to work 
with Asian countries."  China "welcomes" a United States "role in 
ensuring peace and stability in the region" and "bilateral relations 
are in the interest of the two peoples," said Jiang.  China hopes to 
"increase mutual trust" and promote "the sound and stable 
development" of relations "in the new era" during the Secretary's 
visit.  Pressed for specifics, Jiang said that during the 
Secretary's visit there would be a "deep exchange of views on a wide 
range of issues." 
 
North Korea Missile Test 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. "Relevant parties should work together to maintain peace and 
stability" said Jiang when asked for China's response to reported 
North Korean missile launch preparations.  China hopes that North 
and South Korea will "increase mutual trust" and "solve problems 
through dialogue" to maintain the peace and stability of the Korean 
Peninsula.  China did wish Kim Jong-il a happy birthday, but Jiang 
had no information as to whether China gave the North Korean leader 
any presents.  Jiang noted that this year marks the 6Oth anniversary 
of relations between China and North Korea and China hopes bilateral 
relations will "continue to make progress." 
 
Financial Crisis 
---------------- 
 
¶4. China is ready to "strengthen cooperation and join hands" with 
the international community to resolve the financial crisis, said 
Jiang.  China has already begun using a "positive fiscal policy" and 
"relaxed monetary policy" to address the situation, said Jiang. 
China hopes that countries will "increase cooperation," "pay 
attention to development issues and increase representation for 
developing countries."  China also hopes the London G-20 summit on 
financial stability will have a "positive result." 
 
Pakistan and India 
------------------ 
 
¶5. China "welcomes" any actions "conducive to easing tension in the 
region" said Jiang in response to a question regarding 
Pakistan-India relations.  China has "noted" the "real actions" 
toward this end from both India and Pakistan.  "As a friend to both 
Pakistan and India," China hopes both parties can be "dedicated to 
peace and stability in the region."  Regarding Pakistan President 
Asif Zardari's upcoming visit to China, Jiang said "we will do all 
we can, within our ability, to help Pakistan develop its economy and 
society." 
 
Cambodian Genocide Trials 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. Asked repeatedly for comments on accusations that China was 
complicit in the genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, 
Jiang said that China has always followed a policy of peaceful 
coexistence.  Jiang noted that "at the time, Cambodia had a seat at 
the UN."  China hopes that the international community can "respect 
the choices of the Cambodian people and government."

¶7. Asked how China will commemorate the 30th anniversary of its 
invasion of Vietnam, Jiang said that "China and Vietnam had an 
unhappy part of history." However, the "important thing" is that 
leaders of both countries agreed to have good bilateral relations 
"many years ago." China and Vietnam should "put the past behind them 
and face the future," said Jiang.  Jiang said that China and Vietnam 
enjoy "good neighborly relations" and a "healthy and stable 
cooperative partnership."  Jiang noted that the land border 
delineation program "has been completed on schedule."  Asked whether 
China would influence Vietnam's relations with the Vatican, Jiang 
said that China "has never interfered in the internal affairs of 
another country." 
 
Relations with Latin America 
---------------------------- 
 
¶8. Jiang had no information regarding Chinese Communist Party 
Central Committee International Liaison Department (CCID) director 
Wang Jiarui's trip to Latin America.  However, she noted that Vice 
President Xi Jinping recently visited the region.  Jiang said that 
China and Latin American countries have "common interests" and China 
intends to develop relations based on "mutual benefit." 
 
Wu Hongbo Travel 
---------------- 
 
¶9. Asked about Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Hongbo's current trip 
to Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Greece, Jiang said the trip is 
aimed at implementing a consultative mechanism between the Chinese 
MFA and those countries.
