H.E. Thomas J. Barrett 
Deputy Secretary 
Department of Transportation 
The United States of America 
 
Your Excellency, 
 
Thank you for your letter dated July 10, 2008.  The 
Chinese side converges with your proposal on the 
division of areas concerning the first project under 
the Transportation Forum-the joint study survey on 
trade flows and infrastructure development.  Now we 
are coordinating with relevant ministries and 
authorities to follow up the TF initiative and getting 
down to the area of "disaster assistance coordination" 
under the joint project. 
 
Hereby, I would like to reiterate that the Ministry of 
Transport of P.R. China is willing to join hand in 
hand with your Department to put in place what we have 
agreed upon, make full preparations for the first TF 
and promote the efficient, safe and sustainable 
development of transportation between both countries. 
As for details, Mr. Li Guangling, Deputy Director- 
General of the Department of International 
Cooperation, will keep closely in touch with Ms. Susan 
McDermott of DOT. 
 
I am convinced that the cooperation between our two 
organizations will achieve fruitful results. 
 
Please accept, your Excellency, the assurances of my 
highest consideration. 
 
Weng Mengyong 
Vice Minister of Transport 
The People's Republic of China
