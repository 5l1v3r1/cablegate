SUBJECT: INFANT CONTRACTS AVIAN INFLUENZA A (H9N2) VIRUS IN 
SHENZHEN, HOSPITALIZED IN HONG KONG 
 
¶1. Summary: An eleven-week old girl who resides in Shenzhen has 
reportedly contracted avian influenza A (H9N2) virus.  She is being 
treated in a Hong Kong hospital.  Some medical experts have 
expressed concern that avian influenza A (H9N2) virus - which has 
only been documented in a low pathogenic form, compared to highly 
pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus -  might have mutated 
because the girl did not initially exhibit a fever.  Shenzhen 
officials are investigating the source of the infection, but have 
not yet released any findings.  End summary. 
 
¶2. According to media reports, an eleven-week old girl living in 
Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, contracted avian influenza A (H9N2) 
virus and is now being treated at Tuen Mun Hospital in Hong Kong. 
The girl was born in Hong Kong, and her parents took her to Tuen Mun 
Hospital on December 22 after she exhibited coughing and vomiting. 
Because she had no fever, the hospital did not suspect AI after her 
first admission.  She was discharged the next day and returned with 
her parents to Shenzhen.  Her parents took her back to Tuen Mun 
Hospital on December 29, after which blood tests determined she was 
infected with avian influenza A (H9N2) virus.  Avian influenza A 
(H9N2) virus has only been documented in a low pathogenic form, 
compared to highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.  Media 
reports indicate she is in stable condition, but still has an 
elevated white blood cell count, which doctors suspect may be due to 
causes other than the avian influenza A (H9N2) virus infection. 
They are testing her for leukemia. 
 
¶3. Medical experts are reportedly concerned that the avian influenza 
A (H9N2) virus may have mutated because the girl did not initially 
develop a fever.  Hong Kong and Guangdong health officials have been 
in contact with each other to speed investigation of the infection 
source. 
 
¶4. Shenzhen officials have sent a team to investigate the 
residential area in Shenzhen's Nansha District, where the patient 
lives, and indicated they would release an update when more 
information is available.  They advised local residents to reduce 
contact with live poultry.  The patient's doctor in Hong Kong told 
reporters that the family did not raise chickens and that other 
members of the family have not displayed any symptoms of contracting 
the virus. 
 
¶5. This cable was coordinated with Embassy Beijing and Consulate 
General Hong Kong.
