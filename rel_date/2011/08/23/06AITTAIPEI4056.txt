SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: CROSS-STRAIT TRADE 
 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused their 
coverage December 5 on a fatal bus crash near Tainan on Sunday; on 
the upcoming Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral races; and on the 
aftermath of a supposed "secret" meeting between KMT Chairman Ma 
Ying-jeou and PFP Chairman James Soong one week before the mayoral 
elections.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, most papers 
editorialized on the bus accident and the mayoral elections.  An 
editorial in the pro-independence "Liberty Times," Taiwan's 
largest-circulation daily, on the other hand, discussed cross-Strait 
trade and urged the government not to act blindly by easing its 
restrictions and opening trade across the Taiwan Strait.  End 
summary. 
 
"Government Should Quickly Carry out the Mega Investment, Mega 
Warmth Programs" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 600,000] 
editorialized (12/5): 
 
"... Since the Beijing authorities enacted the 'Anti-Secession Law' 
in March 2005, they have started strengthening their economic 
'united front' strategy toward Taiwan in an attempt quickly to 
absorb Taiwan's economy, the island's lifeline, and achieve their 
objective of annexing the island through control of its economy. 
For Taiwan, the best way to counterattack China is to 'fortify its 
defense works' against Beijing's economic united-front tactics.  By 
contrast, easing the island's restrictions [on investment in China] 
and opening [cross-Strait trade] are akin to helping China to 
achieve its objective.  Since the DPP regards itself as a nativist 
regime, and since Premier Su intends to push the 'Mega Investment' 
program [in Taiwan], neither the DPP nor Su should sit idly and 
allow the island to open and ease its restrictions to China blindly, 
or else a decline in Taiwan's industrial economy will be remembered 
as a permanent blotch on the DPP's reign."
