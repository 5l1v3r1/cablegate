  Editorial Quotes

¶1. CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
a. "Copenhagen to define the post-Kyoto era" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(12/08)(pg 1): 
"Xie Zhenhua, deputy director of National Development and Reform 
Commission, pointed out that the developed countries should be held 
accountable for climate change and that the developing countries are 
the real victims.  Many developed countries proposed to control the 
global temperature rise to 2 Celsius degrees, however, according to 
the 'United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,' 
developing countries' first and overriding priority is to develop 
their economies and eradicate poverty.  Many developed countries 
have increased rather than decreased their carbon emissions since 
the Kyoto Protocol.  He Jiankun, director at the Low-Carbon Energy 
Laboratory at Qinghua University, said that the double-orbit 
negotiations for developing countries to reach both a treaty and a 
protocol should not change.  At the same time, technology, funding 
and a process of adaptation should be given equal importance with 
goals of emissions reduction in dealing with climate change. 
Perhaps humans are still intoxicated in our dice game with the gods, 
however, our time is running out." 
 
b. "Copenhagen conference needs to adopt the 'spontaneous order of 
rationality'" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(12/08)(pg 2): 
"What has hindered the Copenhagen conference from reaching a 
comprehensive agreement is the recognition of the emission reduction 
goals and the allocation of reductions.  When we use Friedrich 
Hayek's theory of 'spontaneous order' and the principle 'that the 
marginal benefit of an increase in economic welfare equals the 
marginal cost of carbon emissions' to look at the Copenhagen 
conference, we hope that the 'Rio - Kyoto' line will increase 
adaptability.   We agree with the concept of 'common but 
differentiated responsibilities' which will give China and India 
'autonomy' and allow them to 'voluntarily' implement their emission 
reduction measures, encourage all countries to allocate 0.5% of 
their GDPs as the fund to research and develop low-carbon technology 
and change their antipathy towards fossil energy to reduce demand of 
biological fuel. " 
 
¶2. AFGHANISTAN 
 
"Sending troops to Afghanistan will cause trouble for China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/08)(pg 14): "The new U.S. plan in 
Afghanistan to increase troops needs help from the international 
community, especially from China.  China, however, along with the 
international community, hopes to solve the issue through peaceful 
means.  If China agrees to send troops to Afghanistan, China will 
possibly arouse the terrorists' revenge.  The theory of 'the China 
threat' will grow as well.  Meanwhile, some South Asian nations will 
speculate about China's intentions.  On the Afghanistan issue, China 
will only send peacekeeping troops to help the Afghan people to 
reconstruct their homeland, but will not send combat forces into the 
country.  China could also participate in Afghan affairs through 
many other means if Afghanistan needs help: for example, more 
humanitarian aid, sending more military police to help train Afghan 
officers or helping Afghanistan to train their anti-drug forces."
