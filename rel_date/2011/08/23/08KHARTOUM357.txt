CONFLICTS 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Libyan Government remains open to U.S. ideas for 
advancing the Darfur peace process and resolving the Sudan-Chad 
conflict, Libyan Consul General in El Fasher Naji Yousef told Poloff 
on March 10, 2008.  While Tripoli continues to try to broker a peace 
settlement between the Darfur rebel movements and Sudan and between 
Sudan and Chad, the failure of past agreements has eroded trust 
among the parties.  Believing their opponents will not adhere to 
their commitments, Chad, Sudan and the rebel groups on either side 
of the border do not have a genuine interest in negotiations. 
Yousef emphasized several times that he is open to passing any U.S. 
suggestions for defusing the conflicts in Darfur and Chad to "the 
Libyan leadership" but seemed skeptical that successful negotiations 
on either issue are on the horizon. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In Darfur, the proliferation of rebel factions complicated 
peace efforts, said Yousef.  In the absence of an 
internationally-backed effort to unify the movements and press their 
leaders to rise above personal ambition, negotiations will not 
resume.  Regarding Chad, he noted that Libya is monitoring the 
proposed meeting between Chadian and Sudanese representatives in 
Dakar and that Leader Moammar Qaddhafi is "pushing ahead such 
efforts." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Poloff explained that the U.S. priority is to improve the 
security environment in Darfur to create the political space for a 
peace settlement.  He stressed that governments with influence on 
the actors involved in the conflict should encourage them to seek a 
political rather than a military solution.  The March 18 
UN/AU-sponsored meeting in Geneva will provide a forum for 
discussing how "influential governments" can bring the parties to 
negotiations by building confidence in the process, Poloff 
suggested.  On Chad, Poloff said that the USG supported AU mediation 
efforts and expected that Sudan cease its support for Chadian 
opposition forces, that the Chadian rebels renounce violence, and 
that Chad and the opposition pursue political dialogue.

¶4. (SBU) Yousef, who is entering his third year as the Libyan Consul 
General in El Fasher, is a career diplomat who understands English, 
though is reticent to speak it.  Though reserved at first, he warmed 
quickly and seemed genuinely open to discussing ways that the U.S. 
and Libya could cooperate on Darfur and Chad.  He intimated that he 
reports directly to Tripoli, rather through the Libyan Ambassador in 
Khartoum. 
 
¶5. (U) Tripoli minimize considered.
