1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftels A and B requests and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry 
and Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) 
conducted two post shipment-verifications (PSVs) at Wilson Logistics 
Ltd., Room 1002, 24-28 Kung Yip Street, Kwai Chung, Hong Kong 
(Wilson). The items in question for these PSVs are various 
electronic components exported to Wilson on or about August 11 and 
15, 2008.  On the applicable shippers export declaration (SED), 
these items are classified under export control classification 
number (ECCN) 3A001 and, if properly classified, would be controlled 
for national security (NS) reasons.  The exporter was Luminento IC 
of Chatsworth, California. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Wilson has been 
in existence since 1988.  Its paid up share capital is the Hong Kong 
equivalent of USD 12500.  The Hong Kong Companies Registry lists 
three Hong Kong residents as directors, namely Cheung, Cho Yiu 
Rolon, Cheung, Ka Ying Apple and Cheung, Wing Fai. 
 
¶4.  A review of the company's web site (www.wilson-logistics.com) 
reveals that Wilson is a logistics services company in operation 
since 1988.  It provides a range of services including warehousing, 
inventory management, order management and I.T. 
 
¶5.  On February 26, 2009, ECO accompanied by Commercial Assistant, 
Carrie Chan, visited Wilson and met with Colis Leung, Shipping 
Manager.  She provided background on the company consistent with the 
information on the company's web site.  She stated that the company 
typically accepts packages on behalf of mainland companies and helps 
arrange delivery of those packages to mainland clients.  The company 
likewise helps its clients manage the export from China of finished 
products (often produced using inputs that flowed through Hong Kong 
to mainland production facilities). 
¶6.  Ms. Leung stated that, from time to time, Wilson obtains Hong 
Kong Strategic Trade licenses on behalf of its clients.  Those cases 
typically involve situations in which a freight forwarder or the 
exporter informs Wilson that such a license is required.  Based on a 
review of the applicable documentation, it is unlikely that U.S. 
export or reexport licenses were required for these shipments. 
 
¶7.  As to the shipments in question, Ms. Leung provided 
documentation verifying that the items had reached Wilson in Hong 
Kong and had been turned over to a transportation company named 
Anytime China Express Company Limited.  According to Ms. Leung, this 
was the transport company appointed by the buyer of the items, 
namely Prime Technology (Guangzhou) Inc.  Prime is a regular client 
of Wilson logistics and is listed as the buyer on the applicable 
transaction documentation provided by OEA.  Web research reveals 
that Prime Technology is apparently an affiliate of the 3CEMS Group, 
established in 1997. The group provides engineering and 
manufacturing services (it is a contract manufacturer) and is 
headquartered in Taiwan. 
 
¶8.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes Wilson is a 
suitable recipient of U.S. origin technology, as logistics provider. 
 ECO can make no determination as to the suitability of the apparent 
buyer (Prime Technology) or its appointed carrier.
