to confirm that it ordered the exact type and quantity of 
items listed on the application.  Also, AIT is urged to 
assess NTHU's business operations, on-site security, and 
general reliability as a recipient of USML items.  Emphasize 
that the unauthorized re-export or retransfer of USML items 
is strictly prohibited. 
 
If a site visit is not possible, please inform PM/DTCC case 
officer. Rachael-Therese S. Joubert-Lin, Phone: 202-663-2950; 
Email: JoubertLinRS@state.gov; SIPRNET:

The following questions are provided as suggested guidance 
with NTHU: 
 
--Are you familiar with Attop International LLC? 
 
--Did you order from Attop International LLC the exact type 
and quantity of items listed 
on this application? 
 
--Is the NTHU the final end user of the items?  Will the 
items be integrated into a larger system? If so, 
which system, and who will perform the integration? 
 
-- Does the university understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the prohibition 
against unauthorized re-transfers, re-exports, or changes in 
end use? 
 
--Is Attop International LLC an official supplier/contractor 
for the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan? 
Does the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan have any 
other contracts with the company? 
 
-- Are there any additional foreign parties (consignees, 
freight forwarders, etc.) involved in this transaction?
