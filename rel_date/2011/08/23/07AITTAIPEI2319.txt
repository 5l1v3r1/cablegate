SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage October 12 on President Chen Shui-bian's decision to resume 
the chairmanship of the DPP Thursday, on Taiwan's UN referendum and 
the 2008 presidential election, and on Doris Lessing, winner of the 
2007 Nobel Prize in literature.  The centrist, KMT-leaning "China 
Times" ran an exclusive news story on page six with the headline 
"Taiwan Assures the United States That It Will Not Use Hsiung 
Feng-IIE [Missiles] to Provoke [China]."  Among the editorials and 
commentaries, an editorial in the pro-independence, English-language 
"Taipei Times" discussed the U.S.-China-Taiwan relations.  The 
article said the United States' "economic recklessness and blind 
consumption has given China the upper hand in bilateral relations" 
and concluded that it is "better to be a little tiger with sharp 
teeth than a snack for a giant dragon."  End summary. 
 
"Better a Little Tiger with Sharp Teeth" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taipei Times" [circulation: 
30,000] editorialized (10/12): 
 
"... The US and the rest of the international community have rightly 
expressed their disgust and condemned the junta in Myanmar following 
its brutal crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy activists.  But, 
apart from the odd slap on the wrist and an annual report here and 
there, the same powerful countries stay strangely silent on China's 
human rights abuses, even though scenarios similar to those in 
Myanmar occur on an almost daily basis.  Human rights don't count in 
China when there are economic interests at stake, it appears.  The 
mantra-like calls that were emanating from Washington not so long 
ago for China to revalue its currency have decreased since a number 
of important Chinese academics made public threats in the 
international media about China cashing in its bonds and 
destabilizing the US economy. 
 
"Meanwhile, a reluctance to upset Beijing has also led the US to 
look disingenuous when it talks about supporting democracy.  On the 
one hand members of the US administration traverse the globe touting 
Taiwan's democratic achievements and the US' belief in and support 
for emerging democracies, but on the other the US tells Taiwan it 
can't hold a referendum, for doing so may upset its giant 
undemocratic neighbor and make life difficult for the White House. 
These are just the most recent examples of how the US' economic 
recklessness and blind consumption has given China the upper hand in 
bilateral relations.  And the dream that economic development would 
lead to political change in China has proved to be no more than 
that. ... 
 
"If close economic ties can reduce the US to the role of a 
submissive customer, then what chance does Taiwan have?  Better to 
be a little tiger with sharp teeth than a snack for a giant 
dragon."
