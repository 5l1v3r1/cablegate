SUBJECT: Avian Influenza Update: Guangdong Health Authorities on 
High Alert after Avian Flu Incident 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Director of the Guangdong Veterinary Center of Epidemic 
Prevention and Control Yu Yedong confirmed media reports that the 
Ministry of Agriculture on September 15 had reported a suspected 
case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Guangzhou's Panyu 
District.  Yu told us that test results on samples sent to the 
National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory could be available the 
evening of September 17.  The Guangdong Department of Health reports 
that no human avian flu cases have yet been discovered, and notes 
that it has alerted hospitals and clinics to increase vigilance in 
flu-like cases and pneumonia with unknown causes. 
 
A Window of Opportunity 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Yu, of the 32,630 ducks reported dead, 20,100 
received their first vaccinations less than thirteen days previous; 
this figure was based on the original vaccination records.  Mr. Yu 
explained that although vaccines were applied when the ducks were 
10-20 days old -- the best time for vaccination -- 21 days is 
normally required for full antibody development.  He thought that 
the affected ducks probably contracted the disease before the 
immunization had taken effect.  Though he did not speculate as to 
the source of the virus, Yu said the authorities had officially 
dismissed their suspicions of the quality of the vaccine after 
examining the timeline. 
 
¶3. (U) According to official media reports, 9,830 ducks died 
September 5-13 in Sixian Village, Xinzao Town, Panyu District, 
Guangzhou.  On September 14, the Guangdong Veterinary Center of 
Epidemic Prevention and Control used the fluorescent quantitative 
PCR method to detect a suspected H5N1 strain of avian influenza. 
 
¶4. (U) As part of its emergency response plan, the Panyu Government 
culled the 32,630 ducks noted in para 2 as of September 14. 
Additionally, official media report that road blocks have been set 
up outside the infected village and that inspection staff are on 
duty around the clock to make sure that ducks are not transported 
outside the area for sale.  Poultry markets in all ten villages in 
the town have been closed and health authorities have declared more 
than 130,000 chickens and ducks farmed in these villages unfit for 
sale.  Hong Kong media report that Guangdong will embark on an 
emergency poultry vaccination program to safeguard the unaffected 
poultry population.
