¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Austria is the newest European Union 
country looking to open a Consulate General in Guangzhou in 
the fall.  Meanwhile, Singapore, which currently has a 
Consulate General in Xiamen in Fujian Province, intends to 
open a separate Consulate General in Guangzhou this summer, 
because of the large numbers of Singaporeans engaged in a 
multiplicity of enterprises in the Pearl River Delta. 
British colleagues tell us that the Cuban Consul General in 
Shanghai is being transferred to Guangzhou where she will 
open a new Consulate General probably in September.  This 
will bring the number of Consulates General to 26, with 
Peru, Argentina, and Chile probably still in the pipeline 
perhaps to be joined by Hungary not to mention the on- 
again, off-again Russians.  End Summary. 
 
Austria Coming 
-------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) The German Consul General in Guangzhou has told 
Consular Corps colleagues that Austria will likely 
establish a Consulate General in autumn of this year.  A 
chief focus will be on commercial matters, albeit a chief 
consideration on the part of the local Foreign Affairs 
Offices will be on having another European Consulate 
capable of issuing business visas.  Spain is the most 
conspicuously absent European consulate representative, 
given the large commercial interests of Spanish companies 
in south China, but European colleagues note that Hungary 
has been exploring the possibility of establishing a 
Consulate while the Russians remain an on-again, off-again 
proposition. 
 
Singapore Expanding 
------------------- 
¶3.  (SBU) Separately the Singapore Consul General in Xiamen 
in Fujian Province told colleagues that the island nation 
will establish a separate Consulate General in Guangzhou. 
The staffing is currently being decided, and it is likely 
that the new post will be formally established in early 
July.  The Xiamen Consulate General was established because 
of Fujian Province is the "home area" of the majority of 
the ethnic Chinese in Singapore with a Vice Consul heading 
a branch office in Guangzhou.  The increasing numbers of 
Singaporean business people and their families residing in 
Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and other major commercial centers in 
the Greater Pearl River Delta is the driver for the 
establishment of the new Consulate General. 
 
Cuba Coming On Strong 
--------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) The British Consul General has also learned from 
his counterpart in Shanghai that the Cuban Consul General 
there, Tania Velazquez, has indicated that she will soon be 
assigned to Guangzhou, where she will establish a new Cuban 
Consulate General, probably in September.  She apparently 
has been in Shanghai for only eight months.  Since the 
opening of their Consulate (reftel), the Mexicans have 
maintained a low profile, perhaps because the post is 
headed by a Consul rather than a Consul General.  In this 
context, there is some likelihood that the Cubans will be 
more aggressive in establishing themselves as the leading 
Latin American diplomatic force in Guangdong, particularly 
if Peru, Argentina, and Chile do not move forward more 
quickly with their plans. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶5.  (SBU) The twenty-three Consuls General currently in 
Guangzhou have remarked among themselves that this is just 
large enough a number for there to be a fairly active 
Consulate community while small enough for considerable 
familiarity with one another throughout the Corps.  Adding 
 
GUANGZHOU 00016394  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
three more Consulates General should not in of itself alter 
that environment, but the addition of the Cubans does 
portend potentially awkward, even unpleasant, situations.
