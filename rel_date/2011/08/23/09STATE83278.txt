STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: 
 
The Central Organization for Research and Manufacturing will 
use the requested items in a developmental border 
surveillance program.  Libya has a problem with illegal 
immigrants and insurgents crossing their borders and they 
have a need for automated border patrol.  Once on station, 
the aircraft will fly a surveillance pattern and transmit 
live video of the patrol region back to the ground station. 
The video transmission will be received and displayed on a TV 
screen where it will be monitored for illegal activity.
