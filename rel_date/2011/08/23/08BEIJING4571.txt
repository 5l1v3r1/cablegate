  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"China can only win respect by defeating the crisis" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/17): "Over the last 30 years, China has 
developed better than other countries. Therefore, China is not 
supposed to fail in other's expectations that it will continue to 
develop faster and stronger than these others. However, China must 
endure great pressure in order to perform well. In this way, China 
is able to be called a 'real world-level power', winning the World's 
respect. Chinese analysts indicate that the World has a hard time 
understanding the Asian model of development. The strategy of Asian 
countries' of export-oriented development is appropriate during 
certain periods, but not good in the long run. The theory of the 
'China model' is created by the outside world, but not yet accepted 
by the Chinese government and Chinese scholars. The financial crisis 
in the end of the 90s has shown that the Asian model has a great 
endurance and flexibility. If China can survive the crisis this 
time, China's developing model may be accepted by the World and then 
China can become a real powerful country." 
 
¶2. U.S. DIPLOMACY 
 
a. "The sense of being an empire harms the U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(12/17):  "The U.S. failed to warn the World 
that the financial storm was coming. American economists indicate 
that there was no warning because the U.S. believed itself to be an 
empire. No matter how powerful the empire is, it is impossible for 
the U.S. to maintain the success of their social policy, the 
expansion of their political goals, and their military all at the 
same time. The War on Terror looks like it has brought plenty of 
benefits to the U.S.'s military industry, but in fact it has dragged 
the U.S. department of public relations into a deep mire. The U.S. 
is founded on policies of expansion and has finally paid the price 
for living the dream, and acting like an empire. Among the choices 
of financial innovation and the War on Terror, the U.S. has ignored 
and given up many social and governmental functions." 
 
b. "What is behind the 'shoe throwing' incident?" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (12/17): 
"President Bush visited Iraq in secret. This shows that he has 
little confidence about the situation in Iraq. Bush has three goals 
in Iraq. Emphasize his achievements, pacify the anger felt by the 
American people towards the Iraq war, and send his greetings to the 
soldiers. The deployment agreement, recently signed with Iraq was 
the most noticeable issue during Bush's visit. Bush is making 
arrangements for the two wars, the Iraq war and the Afghanistan war, 
leaving a heavy political and fiscal burden for Obama. It is still 
difficult for Obama to decipher how he'll fill up the 'big black 
hole' of Bush."
