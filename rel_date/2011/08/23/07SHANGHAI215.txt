¶1.  (SBU) In a move to increase transparency in its judicial 
system, the Zhejiang High Court carried a simulcast of the 
proceedings of a commercial dispute trial on its website on 
April 12.  According to Zhejiang High Court Foreign Affairs 
Office Director Chen Zhongping, this was the first time a 
provincial high court in China broadcast a live trial online. 
Chen, the official in charge of the Zhejiang High Court 
simulcast, said the purpose was to expand judicial transparency 
and help ordinary people understand court procedures.  The 
project was initiated by Zhejiang High Court President Yin Yong, 
who was appointed last year and has made increased transparency 
a priority.  Ying had made a formal commitment to broadcast 
trials during a Zhejiang People's Congress meeting in February 
¶2007. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Chen added that the Zhejiang High Court planned to 
broadcast select additional cases this year that had "wide 
social influence" and in which there was public interest, 
including criminal cases.  Chen said it was unlikely that other 
provincial high courts would follow Zhejiang's example and 
broadcast trials.  However, he had heard that there were some 
lower-level courts in Beijing and Jinling that had broadcast 
trials online in the past. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Chen said the trial was not only broadcast on the 
Zhejiang High Court's website (www.zjcourt.cn), but also on the 
Zhejiang provincial government website 
(http://zjnews.zjol.com.cn).  He noted that, in the future, the 
Zhejiang High Court would notify the public five days in advance 
to encourage more people to view the trials.  Zhejiang High 
Court officials had actually informed FSN Rule of Law 
Coordinator (ROLC) a week before the broadcast.  The trial 
itself took about two hours and was a typical breach of contract 
case between two Chinese companies.  Except for the defense 
attorney appearing extremely nervous, the trial appeared to be 
completely ordinary. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Although Chen claimed that the broadcast was covered 
by the local press, the Consulate found only a few articles. 
Xinhua (China's official news agency) had a short article.  The 
Zhejiang Provincial Government's website 
(http://zjnews.zjol.com.cn/05zjnews/system/20 07/04/13/00833 
4999.shtml) had a longer piece.  The website article said 
approximately 5000 people watched the trial during the first 
hour in which it was broadcast.  The article itself had been 
viewed by netizens 180,000 times.  Comments posted to the 
article were overwhelmingly positive, with one netizen 
commenting that the simulcast was a "good step and development." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  The Zhejiang High Court has been active in 
the past year in initiating transparency projects and courting 
cooperation with the Consulate on rule of law issues.  Zhejiang 
High Court officials recently hosted a U.S. voluntary speaker 
and have told Consulate ROLC of their interest in more dialogue 
and exchanges with U.S. legal experts.  Consulate staff will 
continue to encourage the high court in its efforts and believe 
it could serve as a good partner for future rule of law projects 
in East China.
