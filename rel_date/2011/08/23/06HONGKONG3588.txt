Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) and Export Enforcement 
Special Agent (SA) John McKenna, conducted a pre- 
license check at Loja De Armas Rua de S. Lourengo 18- 
18A, R/C, Macau. The purpose of the visit was to 
determine the suitability of Loja De Armas, Macau to be 
a recipient of ten Model 870P 12 gauge shotguns (valued 
at USD $3,300) that are the subject to export license 
application D355059.  The shotguns (ECCN 0A984) are 
controlled for crime control (CC) reasons. The license 
applicant is Remington Arms Co., Inc. 870 Remington

¶3. On August 18 the ECO and SA McKenna visited Loja De 
Armas Macau at the address above and met with Veng 
Cheong Ieong, Managing Director.  Mr. Ieong stated that 
Loja De Armas Macau has been in business since 2000 and 
that it presently employs approximately seven people. 
 
¶4.  Mr. Ieong further stated that he is one of only 
three authorized firearms dealers in Macau and that he 
takes his responsibilities seriously. He produced 
copies of his business registration certificate and 
other documents verifying his comments about his 
corporate history and registration as an arms dealer in 
Macau. 
 
¶5. Mr. Ieong stated that he only sells to the Macau 
Police Department and Macau government sanctioned 
independent security companies. Mr. Ieong stated that 
the firearms laws within Macau are very restrictive and 
the government closely tracks the sales of all firearms 
and related material. Mr. Ieong informed the ECO that 
each time he receives a shipment of firearms, the Macau 
government inspects the order at the airport, verifies 
that the firearms ordered are authorized for sale in 
Macau and then deliver the order to his business. 
 
¶6. The shotguns in question will be resold to a private 
security company in Macau for use in Macau.

suitable recipient of the subject controlled items 
since it cooperated with the PLC and provided 
documentation reflecting appropriate controls over the 
items.  In addition, the consignee operates a line a 
business that is consistent with the potential use of 
the items ordered, and understands restrictions on 
reexport of the items in question.  The ECO recommends 
that this PLC be classified as Favorable.
