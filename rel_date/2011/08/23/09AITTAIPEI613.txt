NATIONAL SECURITY 
 
¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage May 20 on President Ma Ying-jeou's one-year anniversary in 
office; on Taiwan's first participation in the World Health Assembly 
in 38 years; and on a Taiwan expedition team's attempt to climb to 
the summit of Mt. Everest.  With respect to editorials and 
commentaries, on President Ma Ying-jeou's first anniversary in 
office, a column in the mass-circulation "Apple Daily" said it is 
mainly Beijing's implicit support and help to Ma that allows Ma to 
enjoy high popularity at this juncture.  The column said that 
Taiwan, as well as the United States and Japan, do not really have a 
choice when they deal with China, because it is a "must" to be close 
to China in the consideration of international realities.  Another 
column in "Apple Daily" commented on United States former Vice 
President Dick Cheney, who has been making quite a few public 
appearances recently criticizing the Obama Administration's 
policies.  The column said that, in the end, the Obama 
Administration's national security policies are not much difference 
from those of the former Bush Administration.  End summary. 
 
¶2. "Beijing's Implicit Help to Ma Ying-jeou" 
 
Columnist Antonio Chiang wrote in his column in the mass-circulation 
"Apple Daily" [circulation: 520,000] (5/20): 
 
"... It is not against the law to be close to China, the same as 
being close to the United States, which is one of the strategic 
choices.  In the new international order, [United States President 
Barack] Obama is preparing to establish a strategic partnership with 
China.  Japan has a strategic ambivalence toward China.  However, 
under the pressure of objective circumstances, [Japan] also engages 
with China positively.  Basically, both the United States and Japan 
hold the position that Taiwan's status is undetermined, although 
[both countries] express the position in different ways. 
Nevertheless, [both countries] are busy enough with their own 
affairs.  Taiwan must face alone the challenges that China poses. 
In a real sense, Taiwan basically does not have any choice. ..." 
 
¶3. "A Noisy Former Vice President" 
 
Apple Daily Publisher James Tu wrote in his column in the 
mass-circulation "Apple Daily" [circulation: 520,000] (5/20): 
 
"... Interestingly, while [United States President Barack] Obama 
criticizes the [former] Bush Administration, he actually is 
implementing many of the [former] Bush Administration's policies as 
well.  The [former] Bush Administration is criticized for being a 
secretive government.  However, Obama also spares no effort when 
protecting the country's secrets.  [Former United States President 
George W.] Bush's war in Iraq has not seen an overall reverse 
because of Obama's election.  The United States will continue its 
military presence in Iraq, and the number of the troops is even 
going to be larger than Obama's initial projection.  The United 
States' new government is more flexible in its Iraq policy.  ... 
[T]he position held during Obama's campaign is more and more 
difficult to maintain. 
 
"Now Afghanistan has become Obama's war.  However, regarding views 
on Afghanistan, it is not as if Obama has nothing in common with 
Bush or Cheney.  Bush, during that period of time, was worried that 
Pakistan's nuclear weapons would fall into the hands of the 
terrorists, while Obama is no different.  [United States] Secretary 
of Defense [Robert Gates] appointed [Lieutenant General] Stanley 
McChrystal as the new United States Commander in Afghanistan. 
McChrystal is a [former] commander of the special forces [in Iraq 
and Afghanistan] for almost eight years, reporting directly to 
Cheney, and was specialized in clandestinely hunting down and 
killing the highest-ranking terrorists.  A high-ranking officer who 
was so close to Cheney is now entrusted with heavy responsibilities 
by Obama.  Such a development shows that Obama's Afghanistan 
strategy is difficult to distinguish from that of Bush and Cheney.
