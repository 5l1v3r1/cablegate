  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. OLYMPICS 
 
"Chinese people have the right to get respect" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/23): "Western media have run different 
understandings about what President Bush said at the farewell to the 
American delegation to the Olympic Games.  China has opened up live 
reporting from Tiananmen Square to the western media.  This is very 
sensitive in China but western media still feel it is not enough and 
they always criticize China like a schoolboy.  In Chinese 
psychology, China's efforts to prepare for the Olympic should have 
gained merit even if there are no results yet.  But some western 
media's criticism does not report sensibly or with reasons.  The 
Chinese people look forward to getting respect right now.  President 
Bush said American athletes will be 'ambassadors of freedom.'  China 
is a rising political and economic power.  With China hosting 
Olympics at this time, the political meaning and complexity have 
surpassed sports itself.  Western reporters will definitely use the 
freedom of press that Chinese government promised them to be picky 
about China.  Foreign experts indicate that China should be 
transparent and open.  China looks forward to the world's respect 
which will be the highest honor for Beijing." 
 
¶2. NORTH KOREA 
 
"The U.S. says North Korea and Iran are still the 'axis of evil'" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/23): "U.S. officials made this hard-line 
comment at a time when there is progress both in denuclearizing 
North Korea and in improving U.S.-North Korea relations.  South 
Korean officials indicate that the U.S. and North Korea still have 
big differences in their stances.  South Korean analysts think the 
American official's remarks were intentionally adding pressure to 
North Korea and pacifying dissatisfied American hard-liners.  The 
White House is making a tough stance towards Iran rather than North 
Korea by bringing up the 'axis of evil' again.  Secretary Rice also 
has strenuously lowered people's expectations on the coming meeting 
between the North Korea foreign minister and her." 
 
¶3. U.S. MILITARY 
 
"The U.S. think tank talks about space war with China, the U.S. and 
Russia" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/23): "In the field of space China is 
always considered a potential enemy by the United States especially 
after China tested anti-satellite weapons.  The U.S. has growing 
concerns over China's space threat.  However America's NASA director 
Griffin expressed that the U.S. and China have room to cooperate in 
space exploration.  The two countries are conducting preliminary 
steps."
