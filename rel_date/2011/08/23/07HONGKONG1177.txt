1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted a post shipment- 
verification at Techcomp Limited, 6/F, Mita Centre, 
552-556 Castle Peak Road,Kwai Chug, Kowloon, Hong 
Kong (Techcomp).  The tem in question is a GENESIS 
XM2, EDS, KIT, DPP-I exported to Techcomp on or about 
February 18, 007 and valued at USD 36,000.  On the 
applicableshippers export declaration (SED), the item 
is classified as 3A999.  Items properly classified as 
3A999 may be exported/reexported to virtually all 
destinations and end-users worldwide, license free, 
except for certain designated state sponsors of 
terrorism (including North Korea).  The exporter was 
Edax, Inc. of Mahwah, New Jersey. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, 
Techcomp has been in existence since 1991.  Its paid-up 
share capital is the Hong Kong equivalent of 
approximately USD 1.2 million.  The Commercial Registry 
lists Hong Kong ID holders Wai Shing Chan and Yat Keung 
Lo as directors.  Techcomp has affiliated offices in 
China and Singapore.  (more information at 
www.techcomp.com.hk). 
 
¶4.  On April 24, 2007, the ECO met with Mr. Wilson 
Wong, Shipping and Logistics Manager who provided 
detail about Techcomp (much of it included on the web 
site referenced above).  Techcomp Holdings Limited is 
engaged in the design, development, manufacture and 
distribution of analytical instruments, life science 
equipment and laboratory instruments.  Techcomp 
Holdings Limited is a Singapore listed company with a 
range of liaison offices in mainland China as well as 
subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Singapore.  The Singapore 
office is responsible for operations and sales in 
Southeast Asia and covers India, Pakistan, Vietnam, 
Thailand, the Philippines, and the UAE, among others. 
Roughly 90% of Techcomp's products are sold into 
mainland China.  Mr. Wong stated that Techcomp does 
little trade in items included on Hong Kong's strategic 
commodities list. 
 
¶5.  As to the specific item in question, Mr. Wong 
provided copies of the relevant shipping documents 
showing that the item had been received in Hong Kong 
and was subsequently shipped to mainland China.  The 
end-user is TPK Optical Solutions Inc. (Xiamen), a 
touch-screen manufacturer. 
 
¶6.  At the time visited, Techcomp appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the commodities shipped (as 
reseller) since Techcomp cooperated with the PSV and 
provided all requested information concerning the final 
disposition of the applicable items.  At the same time, 
the ECO was not able to inspect the subject items as 
they had already been delivered to Techcomp's customer. 
 Consistent with guidance on reporting of PSVs where 
the items cannot be physically inspected, the ECO 
recommends that this PSV be classified as Limited.
