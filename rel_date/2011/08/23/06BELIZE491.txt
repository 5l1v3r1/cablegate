¶1. (SBU) In recent weeks media speculation has increased as 
to how Belize will vote in the upcoming International 
Whaling Conference (IWC).  Belize is a member of the IWC, 
which is scheduled to meet in June.  The Government of 
Belize (GOB) is in arrears in payment of its dues (REF A), 
and last year did not attend the meeting, but also had 
stated publicly that they had no position on whaling after 
having been lobbied by several local environmental NGO's. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) However, in a letter to the editor that ran in 
Belize's largest circulation newspaper, the Amandala, a 
Belizean citizen accused a top official from the Ministry of 
Fisheries of "touring" with two consultants from Japan to 
identify areas for possible financial assistance in the 
fishing industry.  Weeks later, in the same newspaper, in a 
regular column "Sixes and Sevens", a feature article 
entitled "Time to go, Willie" extolled the virtue of 
allowing the Japanese to increase whaling with the 
possibility of going after whale-sharks in Belizean waters 
in order to increase the red snapper population for local 
consumption. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  PolOff recently spoke with the newly appointed 
Minister of State in Agriculture and Fisheries Mario 
Castellanos who stated that, because he and Minister Vildo 
Marin were both new to the Ministry and IWC portfolio, they 
had not yet determined who would attend the impending IWC 
meeting in June, but that someone would represent Belize. 
Castellanos volunteered that Belize "would vote for the 
status quo" and that this might not please the Japanese. 
[Note: Minister of State is an elected member of the House 
of Representatives and a deputy to the actual Minister and 
Cabinet member Vildo Marin. End Note] 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT. Prior to withdrawing in 1988, The GOB 
apparently voted a pro-whaling ticket in the IWC.  They 
rejoined in 2003, although they were in arrears with their 
dues until very recently and could not vote in 2004 or 2005 
(REF A).  Members cannot vote in the IWC unless their 
financial contributions are paid or a repayment plan is 
underway.  Given its heavy debt servicing obligations (about 
100% of GDP), the GOB recently has welcomed financial 
support from such diverse sources as Taiwan and Venezuela 
(REF B).  If Japan is similarly forthcoming, a last-minute 
change in GOB's position on whaling should not be ruled out. 
Post will report any further information as it becomes 
available.
