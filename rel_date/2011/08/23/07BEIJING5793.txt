¶1. (SBU) The U.S. Government should engage the American 
people, Congress and media and urge them to stop politicizing 
the Darfur issue and linking it to the Olympics, Assistant 
Foreign Minister Affairs Zhai Jun says in an August 31 letter 
to AF Assistant Secretary Frazer.  The letter, delivered to 
the DCM by Deputy Director General for West Asian and North 
African Affairs Song Aiguo on September 4, says great 
progress has been made in Sudan, citing the adoption of UNSC 
Resolution 1769 and the meeting of rebel groups in Arusha, 
Tanzania, and conveys AFM Zhai's view that "the Darfur 
situation is moving in a direction of resolution."  Noting 
that the Darfur issue is too complicated to solve overnight, 
the letter expresses Chinese commitment to continuing 
cooperation and coordination with the United States.

AFM Zhai's letter follows below.  Post will send the original 
Chinese-language version to EAP/CM via pouch.

31 August 2007 
 
The Honorable Jendayi E. Frazer 
Assistant Secretary of State of the United States of America 
Washington D.C. 
 
Dear Madam Assistant Secretary, 
 
I was glad to receive your letter and wish to thank you for 
your hospitality extended to me and my colleagues during our 
visit to the United States last March.  We had an in-depth 
exchange of views on the Darfur issue, which helped us better 
understand each other's position.  I wish to stay in close 
touch with you on issues of mutual interest. 
 
As you know, encouraging progress has been made on the Darfur 
issue since our meeting.  The Sudanese Government reached 
agreement with the United Nations and the African Union in 
April and June on the second and third phases of the Annan 
Plan through dialogue and consultation on an equal footing. 
The Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1769 on 
31 July 2007 on authorizing the deployment of the hybrid 
mission in Darfur, marking an important step towards 
resolving the Darfur issue.  The UN and the AU have drawn up 
a road map for advancing political process in Darfur. 
Responding to the initiative of the UN and the AU, many 
opposition groups in Darfur met in Arusha, Tanzania, early 
this month and reached agreement on implementing the road map 
and starting negotiations with the government as soon as 
possible.  My view is that the Darfur situation is moving in 
a direction of resolution.  This is the result of 
coordination and joint efforts of China, the United States 
and the entire international community. 
 
I am sure you will agree with the view that the Darfur issue 
cannot be resolved overnight, as it involves many 
complicating factors.  However, if the international 
community makes concerted efforts to maintain the current 
good momentum, gives full play to the role of the 
consultation mechanism among the Sudanese Government, the UN 
and the AU as the main channel, sticks to the dual-track 
strategy, makes balanced progress in the peacekeeping 
operations and the political process, and provides more 
humanitarian and development assistance to Darfur, I am sure 
that the Darfur issue can be resolved. 
 
The Chinese Government is committed to resolving the Darfur 
issue and has made unremitting efforts, contributing to major 
progress made on the issue.  We are making active 
preparations for sending the multi-functional engineering 
unit to Darfur.  What has caused my deep concern, however, is 
that some people in the United States are making unwarranted 
charges against China regarding the Darfur issue.  The Darfur 
issue is neither China's domestic problem, nor China's 
making, and it is absolutely unacceptable to link the Darfur 
issue with the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.  The attempt to 
politicize the Olympic Games runs counter to the Olympic 
spirit and is detrimental to the interests of the American 
people and people of the whole world.  I hope that you and 
the U.S. government will appreciate what China has done, 
engage the U.S. Congress, the general public and the media 
and urge them to view China's constructive role on the Darfur 
issue in an objective and fair manner.  This will help 
strengthen the coordination and cooperation between our two

countries as we work to resolve the Darfur issue.  China's 
Special Representative on Darfur will soon visit the United 
States.  China will continue to work with the United States 
and the rest of the international community to bring about an 
early solution to the Darfur issue. 
 
With warm regards, 
 
Zhai Jun 
 
Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's 
Republic of China
