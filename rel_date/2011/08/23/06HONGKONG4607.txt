¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis of the USDOC Bureau of 
Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control Officer 
Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted a pre-license check (PLC) 
at Dynamic Progress International Limited, Unit 1707, 
Tower II, 138 Shatin Rural Committee Road, Hong Kong 
(Dynamic Progress). The purpose of the visit was to 
determine the suitability of Dynamic Progress to be a 
recipient of a PVDF plastic magnetic driven, seal-less 
horizontal centrifugal pump that is the subject of 
license application D366279.  The item (ECCN 2B350) is 
valued at USD $2,227 and is controlled for chemical and 
biological weapons reasons (CB). The license applicant 
is Finish Thompson, Inc. of Erie, Pennsylvania. 
 
¶3. On November 21, 2006, the ECO visited Dynamic 
Progress at the address above and met with Steve Choi, 
Executive Director and Steven Lord, Technical Director. 
 Dynamic Progress is a small start-up company whose 
primary business involves the construction of a 
facility that will convert used cooking oils into 
biodiesel. According to an extract from the Companies 
Registry, Mr. Choi and Mr. Lord are both members of the 
company's board of Directors as are the two 
shareholders of the company, Wing On Yau and Yin Kee 
Lam.  Mr. Choi indicated that the company was in 
existence from 1997 until a year ago as a Hong Kong 
shelf company at which time it was acquired for 
purposes of this project. 
 
¶4.  According to Mr. Choi, the pump will be used to 
remove toxic and flammable gases produced during the 
recycling process.  The recycling facility is presently 
in the initial stages of construction at a remote 
location in Hong Kong.  As a result, the ECO was not 
able to view the facility where the item will be used. 
 Mr. Choi offered to show the ECO the facility when it 
is nearer to completion so that he may see where the 
pump will be installed.  Likewise, Messrs. Choi and 
Lord made available to the ECO extensive technical 
drawings showing how and where the production facility 
will be constructed. 
 
¶5. At the time visited, Dynamic Progress appeared to be 
a suitable recipient of the subject controlled items 
since it cooperated fully with the PLC and provided 
substantial information on Dynamic Progress's proposed 
use of the item in Hong Kong.  In addition, Dynamic 
Progress operates a line a business that is consistent 
with the potential use of the ordered item.  The ECO 
recommends that this PLC be classified as Favorable.
