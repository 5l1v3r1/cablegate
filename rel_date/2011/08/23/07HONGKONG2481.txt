¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a pre-license check (PLC) at the Macau Public Security Forces 
Affairs Bureau, Calcada Dos Quarteis, Macau (Macau Public Security). 
The PLC concerned 170 items of Juniper Networks hardware and 
software used in firewall, VPN, gateway, anti-spam and anti-hacking 
applications. The total value of the proposed licensed transactions 
is USD 3.8 million.  The transactions are the subject of license 
application D382586.  The items are classified under ECCN 5A002 and 
are controlled for national security reasons (NS). 
 
¶3. On September 18, 2007 the ECO visited Macau Public Security at 
the address above and met with several representatives of Macau 
Public Security including Acting Director Sam Peng Chan, and Ms. 
Elaine Ngan, Senior Technician of the Information Accessories 
Division.  Mr. Sky Ho of Netcraft Information Technology (Macau) 
Co., Ltd., the reseller in Macau, also attended the meeting. 
(www.netcraft.com.mo) (Netcraft). 
 
¶4.  Ms. Ngan stated that Macau Public Security had ordered only two 
Juniper items, namely, one Juniper SSG140 Firewall and one SSG520 
Firewall.  She stated that one item would be used at Macau Public 
Security headquarters to enhance Macau Public Security's internal 
security infrastructure.  A second unit would be installed at Macau 
Public Security's disaster recovery site (currently located at the 
former headquarters of the Macau Fire Services).  Ms. Ngan provided 
a copy of the purchase order for the items that had been placed with 
Netcraft.  She and Mr. Chan confirmed that Macau Public Security has 
not ordered additional Juniper items.  Ms. Ngan stated that Macau 
Public Security currently has older versions of these products but 
needs better ones. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Ho stated that Netcraft is providing only these two items 
(referenced above) to Macau Public Security and has no other open 
orders with Macau Public Security.  Netcraft is obtaining the items 
from Cyberworld in Hong Kong. Mr. Ho stated that Netcraft is 
purchasing the items from Cyberworld in this instance rather than 
Juniper directly for what he characterized as business reasons. 
Netcraft operates in Macau as well as mainland China but not in Hong 
Kong. 
 
¶6. At the time visited, Macau Public Security appeared to be a 
suitable recipient of the subject controlled items since it 
cooperated with the PSV and its activities are consistent with the 
use of the two items ordered.  However, in light of the significant 
disparity between the number of items for which a license is 
requested in license application D382586 and the number apparently 
ordered by Macau Public Security, the ECO recommends that this PLC 
be considered Not Conclusive and that a further PLC be considered at 
Cyberworld.
