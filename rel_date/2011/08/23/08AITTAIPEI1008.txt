SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused their July 
10 news coverage on Taiwan's falling stock index and its economic 
situation; on Taiwan's efforts to strive for more international 
space; and on the screening process of the Examination Yuan 
candidates nominated by President Ma Ying-jeou.  In terms of 
editorials and commentaries, a column in the mass-circulation "Apple 
Daily" commented on cool-down in Taiwan-U.S. relations and said any 
improvement in cross-Strait relations will certainly alter the 
United States' assessment of Taiwan's security.  End summary. 
 
"Taiwan-U.S. Relations Cooling Down" 
 
Columnist Antonio Chiang wrote in his column in the mass-circulation 
"Apple Daily" [circulation: 520,000] (7/10): 
 
"... Since the KMT returned to power, [Taipei's policy] focus has 
been shifted to cross-Strait relations.  The United States, on the 
other hand, is busily engaged in its elections, so as a result, 
bilateral relations have gradually turned cool.  The most evident 
change [in Taiwan-U.S. relations] was nothing more than the 
deadlocked [U.S.] arms procurements issue.  In an effort to show his 
determination to strengthen [Taiwan's] national defense, Ma 
Ying-jeou has pledged openly that he would raise Taiwan's defense 
budget to three percent of the island's GDP.  But Washington 
believes that Taiwan has proactively requested that the arms 
procurements be shelved due to political factors on the island -- an 
account that Taipei has denied.  But sources revealed that the 
Taiwan side has not proposed a formal Letter of Request [to the 
United States with regard to the arms deal], and Washington 
therefore has no reason to issue a Letter of Acceptance to Taiwan. 
It is akin to a couple, each of which has his or her own agenda and 
is on the verge of breaking up, but neither dares to speak clearly 
about it. 
 
"Taiwan has been launching all kinds of lobbying campaigns in 
Washington in hopes of winning the United States' support for Taiwan 
to participate in various international organizations.  Such 
lobbying campaigns for Taiwan's international space have almost all 
been put on hold now.  There appears to be no conflicts between 
Taipei and Washington now, but there seems to be a lack of passion 
for each other either.  The images of Taiwan and the United States 
have gradually disappeared from each other's radar screens. ... 
 
"The United States will not be more concerned for Taiwan's security 
than the island itself.  Any improvement in cross-Strait relations 
will certainly alter the United States' assessment of Taiwan's 
security.  If China's influence in the Taiwan Strait grows 
significantly, the United States will surely have to adjust its Asia 
policy. ..."
