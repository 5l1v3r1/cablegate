SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: PRESIDENT CHEN SHUI-BIAN ANNOUNCES HE WILL 
DELEGATE POWERS 
 
 
¶1. Summary:  All Taiwan dailies front-paged June 1 President Chen 
Shui-bian's announcement late Wednesday night that he would 
relinquish all of his governmental and party authority, other than 
that which is granted to the president by the Constitution, and 
delegate his powers to Premier Su Tseng-chang and DPP Chairman Yu 
Shyi-kun.  News coverage May 31 and June 1 also focused on alleged 
involvement by President Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law in the 
snowballing insider trading scandal; pan-Green legislators' 
successful attempt to block a proposal to establish direct 
transportation links with China; and other corruption scandals.  The 
pro-unification "United Daily News" ran a banner headline on page 
two May 31 that read "Endorsements Cross the Threshold; First Motion 
to Recall the President Is Established."  The pro-status quo "China 
Times," however, on June 1 carried the results of the latest KMT 
survey, which showed that 27.9 percent of respondents said they 
support the proposal to recall Chen, while 50.6 percent of 
respondents said they oppose such a proposal. 
 
¶2. In terms of editorials and commentaries, an analysis in the 
pro-independence "Liberty Times," Taiwan's biggest daily, urged 
Premier Su to shoulder the powers delegated to him and to strive to 
create a new prospect for the DPP.  A "United Daily News" editorial, 
however, urged Chen to proactively withdraw from the DPP in an 
attempt to get him and the DPP out of their plight.  A "United Daily 
News" analysis said Chen's decision to cut back his powers will 
affect Taiwan's future political developments.  End summary. 
 
A) "Shouldering Powers, Su's Cabinet Wants to Create a New 
Prospect" 
 
Journalist Wang Pei-lin said in a news analysis in the 
pro-independence "Liberty Times" (circulation: 600,000) (6/1): 
 
"... In the face of the DPP's unprecedented low tide, A-bian 
admitted that he has accumulated a lot of political liabilities 
since he came to power six years ago, and now he is willing to 
relinquish all of his authority.  Su Tseng-chang, as a result, 
should have the guts to throw away all the burdens, ... re-organize 
a strong administrative team of his own, and lead his team using a 
brand new way of administrative thinking. ...  In the meantime, Su 
will undoubtedly become the target of all opposing forces, both 
inside and outside the DPP.  It will be a huge challenge for Su to 
demonstrate his vision and demeanor as a leader, resolve all the 
possible attacks or criticisms, and face more severe scrutiny." 
 
B) "Chen Shui-bian Should Proactively Quit the DPP and Give His 
Party a Way to Survive!" 
 
The pro-unification "United Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] 
editorialized (6/1): 
 
"... Chen Shui-bian hosted a meeting last night to discuss his 
plight, and he decided to relinquish all of his authority outside of 
the direct powers granted to the president under the Constitution 
(let's temporarily put aside the fact that the Constitution has 
never granted the President any substantive powers).  We believe 
that Chen's decision alone still failed to show his determination, 
nor can it resolve any problems.  The only way to get Chen out of 
his plight will be for Chen proactively to withdraw from the DPP, 
namely, to draw a line between himself and the DPP.  Such a move 
will not only get the DPP out of its plight but will help Chen 
resolve his problems.  ..." 
 
C) "Proactively Cutting Back His Powers, Or Breaking Off His Tail 
Simply to Get Away?" 
 
Journalist Lo Hsiao-ho said in a news analysis in the 
pro-unification "United Daily News" [circulation: 400,000] (6/1): 
 
"... Bian handed out his powers, and such a move will create a new 
situation for other political leaders.  Premier Su Tseng-chang alone 
will obtain most of the powers, a move that will make him almost 
certain to become Chen's successor inside the DPP.  It remains a big 
problem whether the other DPP leaders will agree to and obey this 
decision.  If the DPP fails to form a powerful leadership [under 
Su], its infighting will grow more severe.  Ma Ying-jeou, who is 
generally viewed as the quasi-presidential candidate, will have to 
confront Su earlier than expected.  Whether Ma can wait passively 
for the 2008 elections to come, and how he will handle the call to 
recall Chen, will affect Taiwan's future political situation. ..."
