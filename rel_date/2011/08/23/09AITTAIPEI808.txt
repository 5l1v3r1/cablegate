SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: HONDURAS, IRAQ 
 
¶1. Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused July 2 
news coverage on Taiwan's university entrance exams; on former 
President Chen Shui-bian's legal case; and on the effect of opening 
Taiwan to Chinese investment.  In terms of editorials and 
commentaries, a column in the centrist, KMT-leaning "China Times" 
discussed the United States' current attitude regarding fast-moving 
events following the coup in Honduras.  The column said the United 
States is being two-faced in dealing with the group which staged the 
coup so the United States can have the developments in Honduras in 
hand and decide the outcome which the United States wants. 
Concerning the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, a column in the 
mass-circulation "Apple Daily" said the United States will still 
play an important role in post-war Iraq, and the withdrawal of the 
U.S. troops will pose the first challenge facing Iraq. 
 
¶2. Honduras 
 
"How Would Obama 'Attend to the Tasks' Following the Honduran Coup" 
 
The "International Lookout" column in the centrist, KMT-leaning 
"China Times" [circulation: 120,000] wrote (7/2): 
 
"... The United States' attitude has not been finalized yet. 
However, the main direction [of the United States' attitude] can 
roughly be perceived as follows: 
 
"[United States President Barack] Obama has spoken out.  He talked 
in a tone that described the coup as illegal, and said if the 
situation could not be thoroughly reversed, it would create a 
terrible precedent for military coups. 
 
"However, [United States] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 
remarks were different.  She said 'the United States government has 
not yet formally branded the incident a military coup.'  The reason 
behind this is simple.  If it is a military coup, the United States 
must cancel or suspend its aid to Honduras.  Therefore, when 
[Clinton] was asked whether [the United States] would consider 
canceling aid to Honduras, she said [that cutting off aid] was not 
under consideration. 
 
"This is two-faced.  On the one hand, [the United States] on the 
surface expressed opposition to the group which staged the coup.  On 
the other hand, [the United States] did not suspend aid to the group 
which staged the coup.  Thus, Washington can control the group which 
staged the coup.  The development of events [in Honduras] must be 
decided by Washington.  If [the group which staged the coup] is 
obedient [to the United States], it will receive continuous support 
[from the United States]; if not, the support will be withdrawn. 
This is the standard practice of the United States towards countries 
in the world either receiving aid from, or under the protection of 
the United States. ..." 
 
¶3. Iraq 
 
"Baghdad's Fireworks" 
 
Columnist Antonio Chiang wrote in his column in the mass-circulation 
"Apple Daily" [circulation: 520,000] (7/2): 
 
"... Nowadays, [United States President Barack] Obama is coming 
forward to clear up the mess.  However, the withdrawal of troops 
could not be implemented immediately after it was announced, but 
rather step by step.  Even if all of the [U.S.] troops withdraw 
[from Iraq] at the end of the year after next, the United States 
will still play an important role. ... 
 
"Iraqi's politics and religion are separated.  Its society is open 
and the level of its education is not low; plus it has abundant 
crude oil.  Under peaceful circumstances, it could have great 
potential to develop.  Unfortunately, the resentment between the 
Shiites and Sunnis is hard to resolve, while the Kurds are still not 
giving up their dream of independence.  The withdrawal of U.S. 
troops is the first exam for the Iraqi people's [wish to be the] 
masters of their own country."
