AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN JIANG ENZHU 
 
 
¶1.  During a January 13 meeting at the Great Hall of 
the People Senator Lisa Murkowski and National 
People's Congress (NPC) Foreign Affairs Committee 
Chairman Jiang Enzhu discussed economic development, 
energy and commercial protection issues.  China plans 
to double its 2000 GDP by 2010 and to quadruple it by 
¶2020.  The central government will continue major 
infrastructure investments in the western region of 
China for the foreseeable future.  China continues to 
welcome foreign investment from the United States 
particularly in energy, environmental technologies and 
high technology.  Legal protection of foreign 
investors and intellectual property is a priority for 
Beijing.  End Summary. 
 
Economic Development 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Jiang Enzhu 
gave Senator Murkowski a brief introduction of China's 
economy and outlined China's development goals for the 
11th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010).  The Chairman 
explained that the initial planning for the 11th Five- 
Year Plan has been completed and that the roadmap will 
be discussed at the upcoming 4th plenary session of 
the NPC to be held in Beijing in March.  China's 
development goal for the plan is to double its GDP 
from the 2000 level to USD 2 trillion.   The long-term 
plan is to quadruple its 2000 GDP to USD 4 trillion, 
by 2020 (Note: This is an implied average annual 
economic growth rate of 7 percent), raising the per 
capita GDP to USD three thousand, Chairman Jiang 
added.  Chairman Jiang used these development goals to 
underscore China's need for peaceful cooperation with 
all nations, particularly the United States. 
 
Developing the West 
------------------- 
 
¶3.  Senator Murkowski thanked Chairman Jiang for his 
informative talk and asked if he could provide more 
information on plans to develop China's western 
region.  Jiang explained that 12 provinces make up 
China's western region, which account for one third of 
its population.  However, the region represents a much 
lower percentage of the country's national output, he 
noted.  The central government plan calls for support 
for the local ecology, major investments in 
infrastructure and preferential support for regional 
industries.  To evidence the effect of central 
government support for the West Jiang noted that 
Tibet's economy grew at 12 percent in 2005. 
 
Foreign Investment Opportunities 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Responding to a question, Chairman Jiang noted 
that China is very welcoming to foreign investment, 
particularly U.S. investment.  U.S. companies have 
already invested over USD 50 billion in China making 
it the largest single investor in China, he added. 
American companies are very successful in many markets 
throughout China, particularly in the automotive, 
environmental protection and civil aviation fields. 
Future cooperation in clean coal technologies and 
water resource development are two areas where China 
very much needs U.S. investment and cooperation, Jiang 
stressed. 
 
Energy 
-------- 
 
¶5.  The next Five-Year Plan calls for energy usage per 
dollar of output to be reduced by 20 percent, Chairman 
Jiang said.  American companies are among the most 
efficient in the world at energy use per dollar of GDP 
generated and China is very welcoming of investments 
in the field of energy efficiency.  China also plans 
to increase nuclear energy production to forty million 
kilowatts.  The United States is already a leader in 
the field of nuclear energy and cooperation with 
companies like Westinghouse will play an important 
role in China's nuclear development plan. 
 
Commercial Legal Protections and IPR 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶6.  Responding to a question, Jiang stated that 
 
BEIJING 00001059  002 OF 002 
 
 
protection of the rights and interests of foreign 
investors is very important to Beijing.  China has 
revised 3000 laws and economic regulations as a result 
of its accession to the World Trade Organization, he 
added.  Intellectual property protection is critical 
to China's push toward more science and technology 
based economic development.  Over the past year 3000 
criminal IPR case have been filed in China, 2600 of 
which were closed leading to the arrest of 5000 people 
and the destruction of 12 illegal production lines. 
However, China is still a developing nation and it can 
be expected that it will place less emphasis on 
intellectual property protection than developed high- 
tech economies like the United States, Jiang observed.
