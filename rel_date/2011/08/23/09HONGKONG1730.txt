HEADLINES AND EXCERPTS: 
 
¶1. U.S.-China relations 
 
"Sino-U.S. relations get new vitality" 
 
The pro-PRC Chinese-language Macau Daily News remarked in an 
editorial (9/11):  "...The financial tsunami has increased the 
desire of the U.S. administration to cooperate with China and has 
brought more opportunities for Sino-U.S. economic cooperation. 
During Wu Bangguo's visit, he told U.S. business circles that a 
cooperative and win-win situation between Sino-U.S. economic and 
trade relations has already been formed.  Despite the impact of the 
international financial crisis, this basic pattern has not changed 
because Sino-U.S. relations remain economically complementary.  Wu 
also pointed out that Chinese and U.S. enterprises signed 41 
contracts and agreements on investments and economic cooperation 
this time.  It shows that there are many opportunities for bilateral 
cooperation.  As long as the two countries can seize opportunities 
amid crisis, they will attain many achievements.  But Wu also 
reminded the U.S. business sector that under the current situation, 
both sides should follow the free trade principle to prevent any 
form of trade protectionism....  Good political relations have 
boosted the development of economic and trade relations.  And the 
improvement of economic and trade relations will, in turn, add 
momentum for bilateral relations.  This will bring tangible benefits 
for the two countries.  This is the 'lesson learned' from 
developments in Sino-U.S. relations." 
 
¶2. U.S. policy 
 
"On the 8th anniversary of '9/11', U.S. policy returns to its 
starting point" 
 
The pro-PRC Chinese-language Ta Kung Pao wrote in a commentary 
(9/11), "...Eight years have passed but the event seems to be still 
in sight.  The innocent Americans are like big boys who have great 
grievances and who think that they can use their fists to seek 
justice and find peace again.  After eight years, the U.S. is deeply 
mired and cannot get out.  The White House changed its master.  The 
U.S. cannot but review and adjust its policies in the past eight 
years.  History has dramatically returned to its starting point 
again....  The U.S. has to fully readjust Bush's unilateral policies 
and readjust its foreign policies.  It has to drop its airs and make 
use of 'smart power' to start dialogue and cooperation.  It attempts 
to rely on the international community to tide over its difficulties 
and to restore the U.S. image so as to maintain its declining 
achievements.  Though the U.S. has no other alternative, it is a 
good beginning."
