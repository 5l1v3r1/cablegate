KEY EVENTS 
---------- 
¶3.  (SBU) On the evening of 08/02/2008, Chinese Olympic 
organizers staged a full-scale rehearsal of the Summer 
Olympics Opening Ceremony scheduled for 08/08/2008. 
Reuters reports that the 90,000-seat Bird,s Nest stadium 
was filled almost to capacity and USG personnel who 
attended the show indicated that the Opening Ceremony 
extravaganza was enacted in its entirety with the exception 
of the lighting of the Olympic flame.  Embassy officers 
reported that crowd control measures appeared to be 
adequate to the number of attendees and that, despite fears 
to the contrary, the security procedures for entry and exit 
were not cumbersome or time-consuming.   A final dress 
rehearsal is scheduled to take place prior to next Friday,s 
official commencement of the Olympic Games. 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
--------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) Threats:  On 08/01/2008, the Chinese Ministry of 
Public Security (MPS) requested assistance through the U.S. 
Embassy Beijing Legal Attache to determine the origin of 
Internet postings related to two threat streams:  the 
first, a letter threatening an attack on the Olympic Games 
using viruses or a "food bomb," and the second, a series of 
online postings discussing the construction and use of 
explosives (with no specific mention of the Olympics).  An 
FBI investigation into the sources of the information is 
ongoing. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Incidents: According to information passed to 
the JOC by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) Security 
Operations office, Chinese authorities have resolved the 
 
BEIJING 00002997  002 OF 003 
 
 
07/29/2008 incident involving the discovery of water 
bottles containing anti-U.S. notes at Beijing Normal 
University (BNU)--the training venue for the U.S. Olympic 
team.  Beijing police believe the notes were written by a 
female Japanese graduate student who had engaged in a 
heated confrontation with campus security after being 
prevented from accessing her dormitory room.  Handwriting 
samples from the student,s BNU application reportedly 
matched the writing on the notes.  As of 07/30/2008, the 
student had graduated and had moved out of the university; 
Chinese officials feel she poses no threat to U.S. 
interests.   This timely and informative response from 
Chinese law enforcement again emphasizes the priority they 
appear to have placed on cooperating with U.S. security 
personnel on threats and incidents related to the U.S. 
Olympic presence.  Though the police provided the 
individual,s name transliterated into Chinese, JOC 
personnel will follow-up to obtain the individual,s 
Japanese name in order to run requisite record checks. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) According to China,s official state media, on 
08/02/2008 Chinese police detained a man who phoned a 
department store in Chongqing, claiming he had placed bombs 
in the building.  The store was located in Chongqing,s main 
commercial district of Jiefangbei.  Following his arrest, 
the man reportedly told authorities he had issued the 
threat because he was unable to pay his credit card bill, 
but denied actually placing any bombs.  Police reportedly 
swept the building three times but found no explosive 
devices.  Though this incident is not Olympics-related, the 
Chinese response to the threat highlights the importance 
they are currently placing on security throughout the 
country in advance of the Games. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Olympic Protest Zones:  According to Hong Kong,s 
South China Morning Post, as of 08/03/2008 the Beijing 
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG) has 
issued a detailed list of procedures for those wanting to 
hold public protests during the Olympic Games. This move 
comes after an activist from Suzhou was detained and sent 
home while trying to lodge an application to stage a 
demonstration in one of three designated protest zones 
(noted in reftel).   According to the published procedures, 
protest organizers must submit an application and their ID 
cards to the relevant public security bureau five days 
before they want to hold their protest.  Organizers are 
also asked to assign people to help the police maintain 
order during the protest and to wear badges for easy 
identification.  State agencies, private companies and NGOs 
must put their official seal on the documents and have them 
signed by the head of the organization and foreign 
applicants have been asked to provide a Chinese translation 
of their documents.  If applicants have not received any 
feedback two days before the planned protest, they should 
 
BEIJING 00002997  003 OF 003 
 
 
assume their application has been turned down. 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
------------------- 
¶8.  (SBU)   Transportation security remains a key concern 
for Chinese authorities, who have recently increased 
security on Beijing city bus routes in response to bus 
bombings in Shanghai and Kunming.  On 08/02/2008, China,s 
Vice Minister of Railways announced five additional 
transportation security measures to combat terrorism and 
rioting during the Olympics, according to China,s official 
state media.  These measures include: increased patrols 
near rail stations; strengthened management of station 
exits and entrances; tightened luggage checks; intensified 
management of waiting rooms, ticket rooms, and luggage 
rooms; and increased security checks on trains and 
passengers. 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  According to a 07/25/2008 Jiefangjun Bao website 
article, a brigade of the Shanghai Garrison Command Coastal 
Defense Forces recently participated in an Olympics 
security drill simulating a terrorist attack on a Shanghai 
stadium using explosives and poison.  The drill, which was 
completed in one hour, included neutralizing the explosives 
and poisons at the stadium and transporting the wounded to 
a hospital.
