¶1.  SECRETARY CLINTON IN AFRICA 
 
"Africans snubbed Hillary" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (08/10): "On her 
visit to Africa, Secretary Hillary Clinton held in one hand a big 
stick and the other hand a carrot, revealing the combination of 
"preaching" and "assistance" in U.S. foreign policy.  Because of 
this, her visit was viewed differently by African governments, 
African people, and African media.  In general, people in Africa had 
a similar view: they believed the visit had nothing to do with them. 
 For example, with more than fifty percent of Kenyans suffering from 
food shortages, they did not really care about Hillary's visit. 
Analysts believe that Hillary's visit to South Africa had two goals: 
first, to repair the 'so-so' relations between the U.S. and South 
Africa that developed during the previous U.S. administration; and 
second, to persuade the new South African government to put more 
pressure on Zimbabwe to improve the operation of Zimbabwe's joint 
government.  The U.S. clearly understands South Africa's influence 
in Zimbabwe.  It is interesting that Western media reports on 
Hillary's visit focused on the Zimbabwe issue, whereas South African 
media emphasized the two countries' desire to improve bilateral 
relations.  One South African journalist even complained that there 
was nothing new in the talks between Secretary Clinton and the South 
African Foreign Minister." 
 
¶2.  U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"Look at some Western media's anti-China propaganda" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao) (08/10): "Western media outlets, which have been arduously 
reporting on [Uyghur activist] Rebiya Kadeer's anti-China comments, 
suddenly became mute when some of Rebiya's relatives sent messages 
to the victims [of the riots in Urumqi] and Rebiya herself to 
express their dissatisfaction about Rebiya's separatist activities 
and her failure to keep her promises.  Western countries have long 
adhered to the following guidelines when dealing with China-related 
news: all news about China must be negative; all Chinese government 
proposals must be wrong; and any support from China for 
counterterrorism activities must only be the result of external 
pressure.  However, Western media outlets' decision to willingly 
stand side-by-side 'terrorists' (i.e. Kadeer) is not simply fodder 
for their reports, nor an ordinary political prejudice, nor even 
just an ideological stereotype; rather, it is a behavior that 
tramples on international norms and damages civilization.  It is 
also a public provocation of the Chinese people.  These Western 
media outlets are in fact being manipulated by certain political 
powers.  It is these anti-China organizations that have manipulated 
Western media, intentionally created misunderstandings among Western 
publics, and defamed China's reputation." 
 
¶3.  CHINA IN WTO 
 
"Use the rules to maintain China's self-interests" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (08/10): 
"China has recently called on the World Trade Organization (WTO) to 
establish an expert team to investigate the legitimateness of U.S. 
measures to restrict Chinese poultry imports.  China is actively 
seeking to use WTO rules to protect its own interests when facing 
various protectionist measures.  Making use of the WTO disputes 
resolution system is a better way to solve issues than having a 
trade war that will harm both sides.  As a member of the WTO, China 
is willing to accept the binding nature of the current WTO rules 
based on reciprocal rights and obligations; however, this does not 
mean that China acknowledges the reasonableness of all of the 
current international trade rules.  Some of the current rules are 
the result of specific economic and social factors; some are only 
partially or temporarily reasonable; and some only represent 
developed countries' interests and exert a negative influence on 
developing countries."
