¶1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 29, ESTHOFF conveyed points in REFTEL and 
discussed the issue directly by phone with Mr. XU Yansong of the 
China National Space Agency's (CNSA)International Cooperation 
Department, who is already at the launch site (NOTE:  The launch is 
set to take place on the morning of October 30, not/not November 1 
as stated in REFTEL, a fact Xu confirmed directly to ESTHOFF. END 
NOTE) Post also transmitted points in writing to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) Americas Division, and urged the two agencies 
to coordinate quickly in order to work out a suitable solution. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) An hour later Xu contacted ESTHOFF again to notify Post 
that he had discussed the issue with representatives of the Great 
Wall Industry Cooperation (GWIC).  According to (GWIC), the 
Venezuelan and Uruguay governments have received authorization from 
the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to proceed with the 
launch, Venezuela has fulfilled ITU's treaty obligations, and 
Uruguay has registered the orbit; therefore, GWIC sees no problem 
with the launch going forward as planned. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In response, ESTHOFF reiterated that very recent 
information provided by Washington indicates that the issue of 
potential interference problems for U.S.-licensed satellite 
operators has indeed not yet been resolved, despite GWIC's 
assertions today, and requested that Xu discuss this issue directly 
with representatives of the Venezuelan government, who are currently 
present at the launch site.  ESTHOFF further asked that Xu get 
directly in touch with MFA to discuss and coordinate an appropriate 
response.  Xu agreed to these recommendations, and also stated that 
he would be discussing the issue with officials from the Ministry of 
Science Technology who are also present at the site. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Post will report any additional information received from 
CNSA and/or MFA after hours by email and/or phone, but given that 
the launch is less than 8 hours away (sometime between midnight and 
3:00 AM on October 30 Beijing time), and that the issue is not yet 
resolved, Post urges that Washington continue to work this issue 
with the Chinese Embassy.
