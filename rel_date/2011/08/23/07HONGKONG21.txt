FARMERS 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The Hong Kong Centre for Health 
Protection (CHP) is investigating the June and December 2006 
deaths of two Hong Kong pig farmers from a pneumonia-type 
illness.  The Hong Kong government (HKG) reported that both 
men had traveled to mainland China's Guangdong province a few 
weeks before falling sick.  CHP also revealed that they are 
investigating the illness of four other men ) all employees 
of Hong Kong pig farms or slaughterhouses ) who have been 
treated for unexplained pneumonia-like symptoms in the past 
four months.  CHP set up an emergency hotline for pig farmers 
to contact health authorities if they fall sick.  CHP 
contacted Mainland health officials about the illnesses after 
a Guangdong newspaper revealed that a Guangdong farmer died 
of similar causes on December 26.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On December 29, Dr. Thomas Tsang, Consultant for the 
Centre for Health Protection, revealed that a 44-year old 
Hong Kong pig farmer died in mid-December of multiple organ 
failure caused by acute pneumonia.  The farmer traveled to 
Dongguan (Guangdong province) twenty days before his death 
and had been admitted to the hospital shortly after his 
return to Hong Kong.  Tsang also revealed that a 65-year old 
pig farmer died of similar pneumonia-like symptoms in Hong 
Kong on June 4, 2006.  That man visited the mainland city of 
Shenzhen a few weeks before he fell ill.  The Hong Kong 
government began exploring possible links between the two 
deaths after a December 26 report in a mainland newspaper 
that a Guangdong pig farmer died of similar symptoms.  Tsang 
stated that Hong Kong has contacted Mainland health 
authorities to learn more about the death in Guangdong. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hong Kong newspapers report that four other men 
have come down with similar symptoms in Hong Kong.  One pig 
farmer was hospitalized in October for lung and kidney 
problems.  Three other men ) all employees of the same Hong 
Kong slaughterhouse ) have undergone or are undergoing 
treatment for pneumonia-type illnesses.  The first man was 
hospitalized in September; the other two were admitted to 
hospital in December.  One of the ill patients recently 
traveled to Guangdong province (Zhuhai, Panyu, and 
Guangzhou).  Tests show he is suffering from a 
pneumonia-causing pneumocosccus and parainfluenza virus.  Dr. 
Tsang said that CHP was reviewing all Hong Kong Hospital 
 
SIPDIS 
Authority (HA) records from May-December 2006 to identify 
other pig farmers and slaughterhouse workers who have been 
hospitalized with pneumonia. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Officials from Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries 
and Conservation Department (AFCD) have examined local 
livestock, but found no illnesses or abnormalities in the 
pigs.  AFCD requested all Hong Kong pig farms report any 
disease outbreaks among livestock.  AFCD also reminded 
farmers to improve sanitation conditions and conduct timely 
inoculation of livestock.  The HKG opened a hotline for farm 
and slaughterhouse workers to report both human and animal 
illnesses. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Hong Kong legislator Kwok Ka-ki said the public 
should treat this outbreak very seriously in case it spreads 
beyond pig workers.  He underscored that Hong Kong is not 
"overreacting" and that the "best way to tackle infectious 
diseases is by raising awareness."  Another infectious 
disease specialist expressed concern over the government,s 
delay in linking the seven cases.  In a public press 
statement, the HKG stated that it will hold an 
interdepartmental meeting to discuss the deaths and propose 
next steps.  The meeting will include officials from CHP, 
AFCD, HA, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, and 
the Health, Welfare and Food Bureau.
