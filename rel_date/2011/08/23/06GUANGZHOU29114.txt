¶1. (U) SUMMARY: In the first half of 2006, Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region, Fujian Province, and Hainan Province 
recorded rapid growth rates despite government control 
measures and natural disasters.  Strong industrial and 
export sectors fueled rapidly rising gross domestic product 
(GDP) figures.  Growth in fixed asset investment was 
particularly robust, although it focused primarily on 
manufacturing in urban areas.  Urban-rural disparities in 
income remain roughly fixed at a 3:1 ratio.  Despite damage 
from a series of typhoons that struck South China, economic 
growth is expected to stay strong in the second half of the 
year.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) All currency conversions in this report are at the 
average exchange rate of USD 1 = RMB 8.0292.  The majority 
of statistics are from Chinese government sources, of 
limited reliability, and best used in comparison to other 
time periods.  Even then, their accuracy may be limited, 
since the methodologies used to calculate them often change 
without notice.  In the past, authorities have been 
unwilling to explain irregularities or changes. 
 
Guangxi 
------- 
 
¶3. (U) In the first half of the year, Guangxi's GDP amounted 
to RMB 201 billion (USD 25.1 billion), up 13.6% from the 
same period of last year, or 1.3 percentage points higher 
than the growth rate of the same period of last year. 
Guangxi's GDP growth has remained above 11% for the last 11 
quarters, and above 13% for the last 3 quarters. 
 
¶4. (U) The gross output of the farming, forestry, husbandry 
and fishery industries totaled RMB 42.3 billion (USD 5.27 
billion), up 6.8% from the same period of last year.  The 
industrial added value reached RMB 80.6 billion (USD 10.0 
billion), up 18.9% from the same period of last year. Due to 
the increase in residents' income and surging demand, the 
tertiary industry showed significant growth in the first 
half of the year. 
 
¶5. (U) Fixed asset investments in the first half of 2006 
reached RMB 88.2 billion (USD 11.0 billion), up 37% from the 
same period of last year.  Of the fixed asset investments, 
RMB 76.5 billion (USD 9.53 billion) were in urban regions, 
up 41.7%, the highest growth since 1995; RMB 11.639 billion 
(USD 1.45 billion) were in rural regions, up only 12.2%. 
The Provincial Governments recognize the need for additional 
investments in rural areas.  However, it will take time for 
these investments to materialize.  Fixed asset investments 
continue to go to the urban areas where there is a higher 
concentration of factories and businesses.

million, accounting for 82.3% of the total China-ASEAN trade 
volume.

mechanical/electrical products, garments, and spinning 
yarn/thread. 
 
¶7. (U) In the first half year, 3,271 enterprises in Guangxi 
were engaged in foreign trade, up 39% from the same period 
of last year; 56.2% of these companies were private 
enterprises.

of 2006, urban residents' per capita disposable income 
reached RMB 5,174 (USD 644), up 9.9% as compared to rural

14.9%.  The price index rose 0.7%.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶25. (U) The region continues to record rapid growth rates 
despite government control measures and natural disasters. 
The strong industrial and export sectors fueled GDP growth 
higher than the estimated national growth rate of 10.9%. 
Fixed asset investments recorded particularly robust growth. 
However, rural versus urban disparities in income and 
investment levels continue, especially in Hainan Province 
and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.  The expectation of 
policy makers in the 11th Five-year plan is that continued 
development of infrastructure, particularly rural roads and 
connecting highways, will encourage increased investment in 
rural areas and gradually raise rural incomes.  However, in 
the short term, these income disparities, coupled with land 
compensation issues, homelessness resulting from recent 
typhoons, and higher prices for agricultural inputs, could 
increase socio-economic tensions in the affected areas. 
Nonetheless, despite the typhoon damage to farms, 
businesses, communications networks, and water conservation 
 
GUANGZHOU 00029114  004 OF 004 
 
 
projects, economic growth will likely continue at high 
levels in the second half of the year.
