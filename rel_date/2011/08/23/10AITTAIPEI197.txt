SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: DALAI LAMA 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused February 
25 news coverage on this year's College Entrance Examinations 
results; on Saturday's legislative by-elections; and on the 
resignation of a KMT staffer amid allegations of sexual harassment 
and other controversies.  In terms of editorials and commentaries, 
an editorial in the pro-independence, English-language "Taiwan News" 
discussed U.S. President Barack Obama's recent meeting with the 
Dalai Lama and said it was "a direct consequence of Beijing's own 
shameful behavior toward the Dalai Lama and its criminal and bloody 
suppression of human rights in Tibet and the rest of the PRC."  End 
summary. 
 
"What Taiwan Can Learn from Obama-Dalai Meeting" 
 
The pro-independence, English-language "Taiwan News" [circulation: 
20,000] editorialized (2/25): 
 
"... Indeed, besides showing Washington's unwillingness to dance to 
Beijing's tune, Obama's decisions to meet with the Dalai Lama, allow 
the Tibetan leader meet with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and 
numerous congressional leaders, and hold a public news conference at 
the National Endowment for Democracy, was a direct consequence of 
Beijing's own shameful behavior toward the Dalai Lama and its 
criminal and bloody suppression of human rights in Tibet and the 
rest of the PRC.  The Dalai Lama also fully realizes that to secure 
the support of the United States for the cause of Tibetan freedom 
the most important arena is not the White House but Congress and the 
most critical audience is the American people and therefore 
endeavored explained his views on non-violence and Buddhism and the 
importance of Tibetan culture to the widest possible audience during 
his whirlwind visit. 
 
"The decision by the PRC authorities to respond to the Dalai Lama's 
moderation with curses, insults and slanders was surely sufficient 
to show American citizens and politicians just who has taken on the 
role of the Devil in the Sino-Tibetan conundrum.  The majority of 
Taiwan's 23 million people are also clear on this point. ... 
President Ma would do himself no harm by seriously studying the 
Dalai Lama's style of leadership and his sense of humor instead of 
attempting to learn containment and terror from Hu Jintao or 
continuing to kowtow to the Beijing authorities."
