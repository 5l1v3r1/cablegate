Beijing and 30 are quarantined in twelve other provinces and

Affairs Offices (FAOs) in several provinces and municipalities 
continue to request assistance from Embassy Beijing and our 
Consulates to help locate certain American citizens who traveled on 
the same flights as the two confirmed cases of H1N1.

Guangdong's Education Department issued a circular requesting that 
all schools implement daily health checks. According to the

CHINA WANTS TO TAKE LARGER ROLE IN H1N1 RESPONSE 
-------------------- --------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) According to China's Ministry of Health website, Minster of 
Health CHEN Zhu spoke with Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of 
the WHO on May 13, reiterating both China's commitment to provide 
H1N1 rapid diagnostic training to ASEAN countries and China's desire 
to co-chair an international symposium on H1N1 with WHO. [Note: 
Minister Chen had first proposed these ideas on May 8 in Bangkok, 
Thailand at the ASEAN Plus 3 Senior Health Officials Meeting on 
A/H1N1. End note.]
