Six-Party Talks: BDA and Working Groups 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. MFA Spokesperson Qin Gang took numerous questions on the 
United States Treasury Department ruling on Banco Delta Asia 
of Macau, voicing China,s &deep regret8 over the decision. 
 China feels the United States handling of the financial 
issue should promote the Six-Party Talks and be beneficial to 
the financial and social stability of Macau, Qin said.  He 
did not specify why China was disappointed with the ruling, 
nor would he comment on the ruling,s potential effect on the 
progress of the Six-Party Talks.  Qin urged reporters to 
further analyze China's two criteria, adding that they could 
not be partially satisfied.  China holds a firm position 
against money laundering and counterfeit products and has 
taken effective measures in this respect according to 
international norms and regulations.  The Macau SAR 
government is semi-autonomous under China's &One country, 
Two systems8 principle.  Macau released a statement on the 
ruling this morning and will properly address the matter in 
accordance with the law, Qin said. 
 
¶3. The denuclearization working group will being March 17 at 
10 a.m. at Diaoyutai, Qin said, reading off the names of each 
country's head of delegation, including A/S Hill. 
 
ElBaradei Met AFM Cui in Beijing 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. IAEA Chief ElBaradei discussed the Iranian and DPRK 
nuclear issues with AFM Cui in Beijing March 15 after 
returning from Pyongyang, Qin said.  He then departed for 
Vienna. 
 
FBI Investigations Groundless 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. Qin claimed current FBI investigations into Chinese 
companies stealing high-tech "secrets" from the United States 
were &groundless."  China has friendly cooperation with 
other countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. 
Chinese companies active in foreign countries operate in 
accordance with local laws.  Qin said China could not accept 
these baseless accusations and could not understand why 
others regarded China as a threat r thief, calling those 
making such allegation &psychologically fragile." 
 
Human Rights & Premier Wen's Press Conference 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Qin avoided a reporter's question on China's Human Rights 
Report on the United States, in which the reporter asked how 
many Americans sought asylum in China during 2006?  He did 
not directly answer a question on whether the MFA was 
contacting foreign reporters to screen their possible 
questions for Premier Wen's upcoming press conference but 
admitted that all reporters will not be able to ask Wen 
questions because of time constraints. 
 
Japan War Reparations 
--------------------- 
 
¶7. Chinese media asked Qin to comment on a debate in Japan's 
high court about Chinese war reparations.  Qin said the 
China-Japan Joint Statement is a serious political and 
diplomatic document that provides the political foundation 
for bilateral ties after World War II. Neither side can 
 
BEIJING 00001761  002 OF 002 
 
 
unilaterally interpret the document, including through 
judicial explanations. 
 
How Many Treaties Again? 
------------------------ 
 
¶8.  A reporter claimed that NPC Chair Wu Bangguo announced 
China had ratified 18 treaties and three international 
conventions in 2006 and asked the Spokesman to name all those 
treaties.  After having a staff member conduct some research, 
Qin said China signed nine multilateral conventions in 2006 
and had no further comment on the discrepancy with the number 
attributed to Wu. 
 
Pakistan FM Visit 
----------------- 
 
¶9.  Pakistan FM Kasuri will discuss bilateral and regional 
issues of common concern during his previously announced 
March 18-21 visit.
