SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Idriss Deby took power by a coup d'etat in December of 
1990, after which he ruled for several years through a number of 
"revolutionary councils" staffed by his supporters.  Since Deby 
"regularized" his government in 1992, some ten men have served as 
Prime Minister, one of them twice.  Two of them died in office; 
others have faded from public life.  But several of the former PMs 
continue to have thriving political careers.  END SUMMARY.
