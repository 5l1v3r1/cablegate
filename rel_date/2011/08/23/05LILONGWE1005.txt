REF: A) LILONGWE 829 B) LILONGWE 863 
 
¶1. Post is pouching to Department a letter from President 
Mutharika to President Bush, requesting U.S. consideration of 
UN membership for Taiwan.  In the letter, Mutharika cites the 
examples of the former Soviet republics, states of the former 
Yugoslavia, and Singapore as nations that were all admitted 
to the UN following historic changes in circumstance.  He 
argues that Taiwan qualifies as a nation state, and asks that 
the U.S review UNSC resolution 2758. 
 
¶2. Comment: This letter is further evidence of the close ties 
between the Mutharika government and Taiwan (reftels). 
Mutharika devoted a large portion of his speech at UNGA to 
pressing for UN recognition of Taiwan, and Malawi has made 
representations in Taiwan's favor in other international fora 
such as the WHO.
