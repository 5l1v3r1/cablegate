Hamas FM Al-Zahhar's Visit 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  MFA Spokesperson Liu Jianchao answered numerous questions 
regarding Palestinian FM Mahmoud Al-Zahhar visit to China to 
participate in the second China-Arab Cooperation Forum.  FM 
Al-Zahhar will meet with FM Li Zhaoxing, although Liu made a 
point to not respond to the specific question on whether it 
would be a bilateral meeting.  Beijing considers the current 
situation very worrisome and will use the opportunity of the 
Palestinian Foreign Minister's visit to explain China's 
principled, clear and consistent position that Hamas needs to 
give-up violence, recognize Israel and abide by past 
agreement between Israel and "Palestine."  China also firmly 
believes that the parties should follow all UN resolutions, 
abide by the principle of land for peace and engage in direct 
consultations.  China does not support the use of economic 
sanctions or a blockade.  Acknowledging that Israel has 
expressed concern about FM Al-Zahhar's visit, Liu said 
Beijing has explained its longstanding position clearly to 
Tel Aviv and is confident that this matter will not affect 
long-term Sino-Israeli relations. 
 
Iran Nuclear Issue 
------------------ 
 
¶3.  Liu reported that Executive Vice Foreign Minister Dai 
Bingguo will attend the June 1 P-5 plus Germany meeting in 
Vienna to discuss the Iran nuclear issue.  China's continuing 
position is that the situation needs to be solved peacefully 
through diplomatic means, with all parties taking 
constructive attitudes to create a favorable environment. 
The PRC appreciates the EU-3's plan to address Iran's 
reasonable requests.   While Iran is allowed peaceful use of 
nuclear energy as a signatory to the NPT, Iran must also 
adhere to all of its other commitments under the NPT, Liu 
affirmed.

relations and issues of common interest, including the Korean

Darfur, Liu said China hopes the UN and African Union will 
continue to consult and reach an agreement quickly. 
 
Another Japan-PRC FM Meeting? 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6.  In response to question about Japan FM Taro Aso 
requesting to meet FM Li at the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 
Kuala Lumpur, Liu said any future meetings will be discussed 
via diplomatic channels.  The Yasukuni Shrine issue is the 
most important bilateral problem and relations will only 
improve after it is resolved properly, he stated. 
 
PRC-India Sign Military MOU 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7.  In response to a question from a Reuters reporter, Liu

Li Zhaoxing and Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan.  The two 
defense ministers signed an MOU to increase mil-mil exchanges 
that will bring mutual benefit to both countries and is not 
targeted against any specific third nation.  Both sides agree 
on the overall positive nature of the relationship and that 
increased military exchanges will be beneficial to the 
further development of cooperative relations and the 
formulation of a strategic partnership. 
 
PRC Responds to Indonesia Earthquake 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  The Government of China took swift action following the 
Indonesia earthquake, Liu told a China News Agency reporter.

send RMB 10 million in emergency material and equipment. 
China's international emergency assistance team is already on 
the ground in the affected area.  Beijing is not aware of any 
PRC citizens injured or killed by the earthquake. 
 
East Timor: PRC Evacuates Overseas Chinese 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶9.  Liu stated that China is very worried about the situation 
in East Timor and hopes it quickly stabilizes.  In response 
to the deteriorating circumstances, China sent two charter 
planes to evacuate about 200 of the approximately 500 
overseas Chinese living in East Timor.  An unspecified number 
of PRC Embassy staff also returned to China on the flights.
