SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: CROSS-STRAIT TALKS 
 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused June 11 
news coverage on the talks between Taiwan's Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations across the 
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), which will formally kick off Thursday; on 
South Korea's cabinet, which offered to resign Tuesday amid massive 
street protests against the import of U.S. beef; and on a Taiwan 
fishing boat, which sank off the Tiaoyutai islands after colliding 
with a Japanese frigate Tuesday.  In terms of editorials and 
commentaries, an editorial in the pro-independence "Liberty Times" 
strongly demanded that Taiwan's sovereignty be asserted during the 
upcoming talks between SEF and ARATS.  An analysis in the 
pro-unification "United Daily News" also urged SEF Chairman Chiang 
Pin-kun to express the Taiwan people's hope for 'reciprocity and 
dignity' during his talks with ARATS.  End summary. 
 
A) "Results of [Cross-Strait] Talks Must Be Put through a Popular 
Vote If They Endanger Taiwan's Sovereignty" 
 
The pro-independence "Liberty Times" [circulation: 720,000] 
editorialized (6/11): 
 
"...  In an attempt to maintain Taiwan's status as an independent 
sovereign nation and to safeguard the common interests of the 23 
million people in Taiwan, we demand that [Straits Exchange 
Foundation Chairman] Chiang Pin-kun firmly stand by and defend 
Taiwan's sovereignty status.  He must never endorse any conclusion 
or statement [reached with China] which secretly carries 
self-disparaging [wording] such as "The One China Consensus," 
because only the 23 million people of Taiwan have the final say 
about [Taiwan's] sovereignty.  The process and results of the 
[cross-Strait] talks must also be kept transparent, and there should 
not be any secret deals.  Should [both sides reach any agreement] 
that will jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty, the Taiwan government 
should reject such a conclusion, or it should put the conclusion to 
a popular vote so as to meet the principle that says 'sovereignty 
lies in the hands of the people.'  President Ma has emphasized more 
than once that Taiwan's future must be determined by the 23 million 
people in Taiwan.  Hasn't he? 
 
B) "Challenge for Chiang Pin-kun:  What to Put on the New Page of 
History?" 
 
Journalist Li Chih-te wrote in the pro-unification "United Daily 
News" [circulation: 400,000] (6/11): 
 
"... The significance of [Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman] 
Chiang Pin-kun's trip [for talks with China's Association for 
Relations across the Taiwan Strait] will certainly not be limited to 
signing the agreements on direct charter flights and opening Taiwan 
to Chinese tourists.  The resumption of 'systematic negotiations' 
[between the two sides] is in reality the common objective pursued 
by both sides of the Taiwan Strait in the wake of Taiwan's 
presidential election in March. ... 
 
"Such a historic opportunity -- offering resumption of 
[cross-Strait] dialogue -- is both precious and fragile.  Thus, the 
mission shouldered by Chiang, besides concluding the already decided 
agreements, also includes the heavy and major responsibility of 
[helping to] 'define the nature' of future talks between the two 
sides.  Given the [amicable] climate for cross-Strait 
reconciliation, there should be room for Chiang to express to the 
Chinese leaders the Taiwan people's expectations of 'reciprocity and 
dignity.'  If Chiang fails on this part in the very beginning [of 
the talks], [Taiwan] might have to pay a higher price if it wants to 
do it next time in the future. ...  What kind of [legacy] does 
Chiang want to leave behind during this trip to Beijing?  This is a 
major issue closely related to his future status in history, and it 
will be a key test of his wisdom."
