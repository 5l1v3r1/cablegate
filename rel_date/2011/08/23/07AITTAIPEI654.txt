SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S.-CHINA-TAIWAN RELATIONS 
 
 
Summary:  News coverage of Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies 
March 22 focused on the year-end legislators' elections, on the 2008 
presidential election, and on local political and social issues.  In 
terms of editorials and commentaries, an editorial in the 
limited-circulation, conservative, pro-unification, English-language 
"China Post" discussed AIT Director Stephen Young's address during 
an American Chamber of Commerce's annual post-Chinese New Year 
gathering Tuesday.  The article echoed Director Young's remarks on 
expanding cross-Strait relations and urged the Taiwan leaders to 
have "a grand vision in mapping out plans for the island's future." 
An op-ed piece in the limited-circulation, pro-independence, 
English-language "Taipei Times," on the other hand, discussed the 
development of U.S.-Taiwan relations following the upcoming Congress 
and presidential elections in both Taiwan and the United States. 
The article said "An ongoing dialogue system could help smooth out 
political differences while each side is making its policies."  End 
summary. 
 
A) "Time to Expand Cross-Strait Ties" 
 
The conservative, pro-unification, English-language "China Post" 
[circulation: 30,000] (3/22): 
 
"American Institute in Taipei [sic] (AIT) Director Stephen M. Young 
on Tuesday urged Taiwan to further open its economic ties with 
China, suggesting that 'for this place to prosper, people, goods and 
capital should be able to move more freely across the Strait.'  We 
wonder whether or not our government leaders have the wisdom to 
listen to Young's comments. ...  How true those words are.  As we 
have time and again pointed out in our editorials, the tendency of 
the government to limit the development of relations with the 
Chinese mainland has been hampering the island's development and has 
resulted in stagnation and isolation.  The Republic of China's 
leaders must have a grand vision in mapping out plans for the 
island's future.  A narrow, provincial outlook can never taken [sic] 
Taiwan out of its current predicament." 
 
B) "Dialogue Will Be Key during the Elections" 
 
Nat Bellocchi, former chairman of AIT and now a special adviser to 
the Liberty Times Group, opined in the pro-independence, 
English-language "Taipei Times" [circulation: 30,000] (3/22): 
 
"... The elections of Congress and a new president in the US will 
come only a few months after those in Taiwan.  Any change in the 
relationship between Washington and Taipei will be determined in the 
early days of the new Taiwanese government and in the midst of US 
elections -- not necessarily the best time for diplomatic change. 
Early next year, Taiwan will have a new government.  The US, 
however, will be dispatching personnel and developing its policies 
only in early 2009.  An ongoing dialogue system could help smooth 
out political differences while each side is making its policies."
