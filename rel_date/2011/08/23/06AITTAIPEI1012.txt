PROGRAM 
 
 
¶1.  U.S. Coast Guard LCDR Scott Kim and LT Richard Kavanaugh visited 
Taiwan March 20 and 21 to brief Taiwan officials on the Coast 
Guard's International Port Security (IPS) Program.  Kim and 
Kavanaugh met with officials from the Ministry of Transportation and 
Communications (MOTC), the Executive Yuan Counter-Terr 
orism Office, 
the Directorate General of Customs, and the Taiwan Coast Guard.  All 
of the Taiwan interlocutors expressed support for the program. 
Senior Specialist Li Juel-der of MOTC's Department of Navigation and 
Aviation, Taiwan's counterpart agency for this program, 
enthusiastically agreed that Taiwan would accept a formal visit 
under the program in the coming months. 
 
¶2.  AIT/T strongly endorses implementation of the IPS Program in 
Taiwan and believes the Taiwan authorities will be good partners. 
Taiwan has been highly cooperative throughout implementation of the 
Container Security Initiative and in discussions to initiate the 
Megaports Program.  Taiwan is not a member of the International 
Maritime Organization (IMO).  The IPS Program will be particularly 
useful in helping Taiwan fulfill its voluntary commitment to conform 
with the IMO's International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. 
 
 
¶3.  This telegram was cleared by USCG LCDR Kim and LT Kavanaugh.
