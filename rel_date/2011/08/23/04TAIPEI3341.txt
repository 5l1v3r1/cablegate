SUBJECT: NEW CDC DIRECTOR TALKS ABOUT POST-SARS TAIWAN 
 
REF: STATE 225331 
 
¶1. (SBU) While delivering reftel demarche to the Taiwan 
Center for Disease Control on October 21, AIT became 
acquainted with the CDC's new director, Steve H.S. Kuo.  Kuo 
introduced himself, saying that he just assumed his new 
position on October 18, after working in Washington for four 
years as the Health Advisor at the Taipei Economic and 
Cultural Representative Office (TECRO).  He explained that in 
the post-SARS era, political will in Taiwan was strong for 
expanding the government's capacity for dealing with future 
outbreaks of infectious diseases.  Kuo detailed some of the 
changes: the CDC's budget has been increased from $61 million 
to $100 million a year; it is actively recruiting young, 
ambitious physicians, expanding its medical staff from 3 to 
30; and there is a proposal currently under consideration 
that would earmark an additional $300 million to finance a 
new vaccine production facility in Taiwan that would combat 
avian flu and other diseases. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kuo described his efforts to increase cooperation 
between the Taiwan CDC and its US counterpart.  He said that 
a 1994 umbrella agreement between the Taiwan Department of 
Health (DOH) and the US CDC was a good foundation for such 
cooperation, citing the example of a 1999 implementation of 
that agreement for a joint project to control the spread of 
tuberculosis.  Taiwan, he explained, is an important partner 
for the US in a global public health network.  Every year 
millions of Taiwanese businesspeople and tourists travel to 
and from the Mainland, including those parts of southern 
China where many infectious diseases first appear.  With its 
sophisticated detection technology and modern, transparent 
public health infrastructure, he said, Taiwan is ideally 
situated to act as a "sentinel" for new diseases coming out 
of China.  He said that he looked forward to any 
opportunities to cooperate with the US and that he envisioned 
Taiwan becoming an essential part of a global disease 
prevention network.
