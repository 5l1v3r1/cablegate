SUBJECT: Congressman Kennedy and Vatican Representative in 
Taiwan Discuss Cross-Strait Religious Issues 
 
¶1. (SBU) Congressman Mark Kennedy (R-MN) met with Apostolic 
Nunciature Charge D'affaires Monsignor Ambrose Madtha on 
June 6, 2005.   Madtha estimated there were currently 
300,000 Catholics in Taiwan and 5-10 new priests came out of 
Taiwan's seminaries every year.  Growth of the Catholic 
population in Taiwan has been fairly slow, but the Church 
has not been involved in active evangelization.  Madtha 
stated there were 16 million Catholics in Mainland China, 12 
million of whom were practicing underground.  When asked 
about the Catholic Church's position in the Mainland, Madtha 
replied that the Vatican had had some problems with Beijing. 
The most problematic issue had been Beijing's insistence on 
choosing its own bishops, an "internal issue" in the eyes of 
the PRC government.  Pope John Paul II's canonization of 
Chinese martyrs on October 1, 2000 also caused a severe rift 
in bilateral relations 
 
¶2. (SBU) Congressman Kennedy asked about rumors that the 
Vatican might shift diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to 
the PRC and how such a shift would affect relations with 
Taiwan.  Madtha asserted that these rumors were unfounded 
and that he personally had not heard of any changes to come. 
He also stated that even if a shift occurred, relations with 
Taiwan would not change much, because the Vatican valued 
Taiwan's respect for freedom of religion. 
 
¶3. (U) Congressman Kennedy's office has cleared this 
message.
