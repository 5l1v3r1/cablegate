and Industry Department (TID) Assistant Director General 
Petty Lai on October 24.  On November 9, Lai gave Econoff a 
non-paper laying out Hong Kong's positions on its major APEC 
priorities and said that Hong Kong generally supports U.S. 
positions on FTA draft models, technology choice principles, 
and IPR model guidelines.  As for the November 1-3 Food 
Defense Workshop, Lai said that the relevant Hong Kong 
Government (HKG) officials were previously committed to other 
engagements and were unfortunately unable to attend.  Econoff 
also delivered Ref B talking points and Food Defense Workshop 
summary to TID Trade Assistant Ada Kwan on November 13.  Kwan

consider participation in future Food Defense related 
activities.

APEC Economic Leader's Meeting 2006 - Positions and Views of 
Hong Kong on Major Issues 
 
Support for Multilateral Trading System 
---------------------------------------- 
 
Since the suspension of negotiations under the Doha 
Development Agenda (DDA) in July, WTO members have still not 
yet reached a consensus on when and in what way to re-open 
the negotiations.  We expect that the Leaders would issue a 
strong and firm statement aiming to urge the WTO members to 
double their efforts to resume as soon as possible DDA 
negotiations with flexible and pragmatic manners so as to 
achieve an early completion. 
 
Hanoi Action Plan for the Implementation of the Busan Roadmap 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
The Senior Officials' Meeting (SOM) is considering the Hanoi 
Action Plan for the implementation of the Busan Roadmap. 
Concrete work will commence next year.  The smooth 
implementation of the Action Plan is critical to the 
achievement of the Bogor Goals.  We anticipate steering from 
the Leaders concerning the way forward and reiteration of our 
determination to achieve the Bogor Goals by 2010 and 2020. 
 
Trade Facilitation 
------------------- 
 
2006 is a pivotal year for trade facilitation.  The SOM has 
endorsed the review findings on the Trade Facilitation Action 
Plan (TFAP) confirming the achievement of the targeted 5% 
reduction in trade transaction costs, and agreed on the 
framework of TFAP2 for a further 5% reduction in transaction 
costs by 2010.  We look forward to the Leader's recognition 
of the efforts made by members and encourage the prompt 
implementation of concrete work. 
 
APEC Reform 
------------ 
 
Senior officials are considering the reform proposals 
prepared by the Friends of the Chair Group on APEC Reform. 
We expect to see a more streamlined structure of APEC aiming 
for higher efficiency and effectiveness of operation, and 
greater focus of its work on the core areas.
