REF: A) USDOC 09011 B) D383541 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), conducted 
a pre-license check at Computime Limited, 17/F, Great Eagle Center, 
23 Harbor Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong (Computime). The purpose of the 
visit was to determine the suitability of Computime to be a 
recipient of technology and hardware for CTL Zigbee radio modules 
and related software that are the subject of export license 
application D383541.  The items (ECCN 5A002 and 5E002) are valued at 
USD $25,003 and are controlled for national security reasons (NS). 
The license applicant is Cincinnati Technologies of Mason Ohio. 
 
¶3. On November 16, 2007, ECO visited Computime at the address listed 
above and met with Mr. Shen Owyang, General Manager, Wireless 
Solutions.  According to Mr. Owyang, the company was established in 
1974 and is involved in the design and production of remote 
controllers for household heating and cooling equipment.  The 
company has operations worldwide, including production facilities in 
mainland China.  Customers are located in Asia, Europe and the 
United States (but, as of yet, not in mainland China).  Computime is 
a Hong Kong stock exchange listed company (its IPO was completed in 
2006). 
 
¶4.  Mr. Owyang stated that Computime is in the final stages of its 
acquisition of Cincinnati Technologies (the license applicant).  As 
part of that acquisition, certain design software for various 
controllers will be transferred to Computime.  Mr. Owyang stressed 
that the underlying encryption technology that is the subject of the 
license application is actually not designed or controlled by either 
Cincinnati Technologies or Computime.  Rather, those companies 
purchase chip sets from Ember Technologies (www.ember.com) and it is 
those chip sets that contain the encryption.  OEA may wish to 
confirm that Ember is, in fact, obtaining licenses (as appropriate) 
for any chip sets containing encryption technology that it is 
sending to Computime. 
 
¶5. Mr. Owyang stated that he and the company are keen to comply with 
all applicable export controls (including both U.S. and Hong Kong 
controls).  Computime expects to finalize the acquisition of 
Cincinnati Technologies shortly and Mr. Owyang therefore requested 
that the license application be considered expeditiously.
