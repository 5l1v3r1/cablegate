REF: STATE 99591 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Per reftel request, AIT/T Econoff and FN visited 
Vichem Company, Ltd. and interviewed Vichem President Mark Hsu, 
husband of Vichem Chairwoman Tai Wen-min, and Mr. Rocky Pong, Senior 
Manager.  Ms. Tai was not available for the interview.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Vichem was established in 1990, and registered as a U.S. 
broker in September 2006. The company has seven employees. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT), Ministry 
of Economic Affairs (MOEA), Vichem is registered as a trading 
company.  The company's registration information, including the 
company address and contact numbers, is identical to the reference 
stated in paragraph three of reftel. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Vichem serves as a representative for several companies 
brokering products primarily for communications and electronics 
systems.  Mr. Hsu stated all of Vichem's customers are in Taiwan. 
The company's major business comes from the Taiwan military, 
including the Marine Corps, Army, and the Chung Shan Institute of 
Science and Technology (CSIST). 
 
¶5. (SBU) Besides being the sole agent of U.S.-based ITT 
Corporation's Communication Systems Division, Vichem is also a 
representative for Canada-based Ultra Electronics, Norway-based 
COMROD, France-based ATDI, South Korea-based LIG NEX1 Co., Ltd., and 
Taiwan's Optotech Co. 
 
¶6. (SBU) After contracts are signed between the mother companies and 
Taiwan's end users, Vichem is responsible for receiving, inspecting, 
and delivering parts to the end users.  Items of a small scale are 
stored in Vichem's office space.  The company does not have 
warehouse or formal storage area for parts it receives, as its 
facilities are limited in size.  If a contract includes items of a 
larger scale, Vichem stores them in a Taiwan Customs' warehouse for 
a few days before delivering them to customers. 
 
¶6. (SBU) All the contracts are processed in the 
government-to-government Financial Management Service (FMS) channel. 
Therefore, Vichem is not involved in contract paperwork. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Both Mr. Hsu and Mr. Pong understand the basic limitations 
dictated in the USML regulations, but depend primarily on the U.S. 
company it represents to identify specific, relevant regulations for 
each contract. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Neither AIT nor its Taiwan law-enforcement sources has 
derogatory information in its files concerning Vichem Company or Ms. 
Tai Wen-min
