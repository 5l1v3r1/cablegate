¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: Environmental Protection Bureaus in the 
Southwest Chinese cities of Chengdu and Chongqing are studying 
local greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Chengdu environmental 
officials will start measuring two GHGs, carbon dioxide and 
methane, but have not said how they will use this data. 
Chongqing does not currently monitor GHGs, but focuses on 
foreign technology transfer that could help reduce GHG emissions 
from coal-fired power plants. City officials also seem 
interested in learning more about emissions trading systems. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
Chengdu Pilot Project to Measure Green House Gases? 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Chengdu environmental officials plan this year to 
install greenhouse gas monitoring equipment for the first time 
at one of the city's air quality monitoring stations.  Chengdu 
has 38 automated air quality monitoring stations throughout the 
greater metropolitan area that measure nitrogen dioxide, sulfur 
dioxide (SO2), and large particulate matter.  Officials at the 
Chengdu Environmental Supervision Center (CESC) told Congenoff 
that they planned to install equipment to monitor carbon dioxide 
(CO2) and methane, two potent GHGs.  The only currently planned 
GHG monitoring site will be in downtown Chengdu, on top of a 
low-rise building at the Sichuan Provincial Number Three 
People's Hospital. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Chengdu environmental officials will not say how they 
will use the data collected from the station or if GHG 
monitoring will be expanded to other stations around the city. 
The Sichuan Environmental Protection Bureau has projects to 
reduce agricultural GHG emissions and additional data could 
support this effort.  CESC officials declined recent requests 
for meetings with the consulate.  Chengdu's GHG monitoring 
effort may be related to plans being discussed by national-level 
environmental officials for regional emissions caps during the 
12th Five Year Program (2011-2015).  An early May 2009 China 
Environmental News story suggests that the GHG monitoring 
equipment has yet to be installed in Chengdu. 
 
 
 
Chongqing Researching GHG Emissions and Seeking Advanced 
Technology 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
-------- 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Senior engineer Ran Tao of the Chongqing Center of 
Environmental Monitoring and the Chongqing Academy of 
Environmental Science told Congenoff in early May that she was 
researching ways the municipality could reduce GHG emissions. 
She commented that Chongqing Mayor Wang Hongju is very 
interested in reducing GHG emissions.  Rao said that power 
generation accounts for 77 percent of Chongqing's total GHG 
emissions but said that this estimate is not based on actual 
emissions monitoring.  She estimated emissions level using a 
methodology she said is consistent with that of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  Ran said that she 
had not heard of any current GHG monitoring projects like 
Chengdu's, and Chongqing did not plan to monitor GHGs. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ran concluded that Chongqing needs to increase 
technology transfer from foreign countries in order to reduce 
power plant emissions.  She asserted that developed countries 
have not done enough to help Chongqing reduce GHGs from 
coal-fired power plants.  Chongqing's official statistics show 
that it relies on coal for about two-thirds of its total energy 
consumption.  Ran's research suggests to her that advanced 
coal-power technology is the best option for Chongqing

municipality, and other sources like wind power are not viable 
options.  While she did not mention a specific coal technology, 
Rao seemed to be suggesting that developed countries should be 
doing more to help China develop carbon capture and 
sequestration technology.  At the same time, she deemphasized 
the idea of using existing technology to increase the thermal 
efficiency of power plants.  Note: Congenoff found it surprising 
that, given Rao's focus on power plant GHG emissions, she did 
not know the average thermal efficiency of coal-fired power 
plants in Chongqing. 
 
 
 
Ongoing Emissions Trading Research 
 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) Rao is very interested in emissions trading systems 
like the Clean Development Mechanism established under the Kyoto 
Protocol and the SO2 trading program in the United States.  She 
has researched the topic and is familiar with the U.S. Clean Air 
Act.  When Congenoff asked about whether Chongqing is seeking to 
implement some form of emissions trading to control CO2 or SO2 
emissions, Rao side-stepped the question.  She replied only that 
the National Development and Reform Commission had primary 
responsibility for addressing global warming. 
 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment: During Congenoff's discussion with Rao, 
several of her questions suggested that she may also be 
researching methods of adapting an emissions trading system to 
control water pollution in Chongqing's rivers.  Rao did not say 
if she was looking at intra-municipality trading systems or 
larger regional or national systems.
