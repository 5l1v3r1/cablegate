SUBJECT: THE LIBYAN NATIONAL CENTRE FOR STANDARDIZATION AND METROLOGY 
- AN OVERVIEW 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  The Libyan National Centre for Standardization and 
Metrology (LNCSM) was established with the goal of bringing 
Libya into conformance with international trade standards, 
focusing on eventual accession of Libya to the World Trade 
Organization (WTO.)  The current focus within the LNCSM is 
protecting the health and safety of Libya's citizens and 
environment by creating a valid national testing and conformity 
assessment system.  The LNCSM monitors the trade climate within 
Libya to avoid creating unnecessary barriers to trade, harmonize 
the rules of competition, and avoid or remove non-tariff trade 
barriers.  In addition, they maintain a focus on avoidance of 
putting measures in place that would be contrary to Libya's 
eventual obligations, if and when they can achieve membership in 
the WTO.  The director general of the LNCSM, Dr. Ahmed Shembesh, 
in addition to seeking international acceptance of testing and 
reports generated within Libya, also seeks to create domestic 
confidence in Libya's testing procedures, as well as the bodies 
charged with undertaking those procedures.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
--------- 
The Current Program 
--------- 
 
¶2.  Currently the market surveillance portion of the LNCSM 
charter is limited by poor communication resources, lack of 
established procedures and norms, lack of historical record 
keeping, and a nebulous market place that suffers from porous 
borders and IPR violations on every scale.  The LNCSM recognizes 
these issues and focuses their current limited program of market 
surveillance and national conformity on the following areas: 
 
--Protection of consumers from hazards posed by unsafe imported 
materials 
--Facilitating the exchange of goods between local industries 
and enterprises 
--Facilitating the export of local goods by ensuring that they 
bring a fair price 
--Taking a special focus on export assistance to small and 
medium sized businesses 
 
--------- 
The Direction of the LNCSM 
--------- 
 
¶3.  The LNCSM intends to be the driving force behind upgrading 
and establishing a functioning conformity assessment and 
consumer protection system in Libya's near future.  They 
envision a system afforded appropriate laws, and protected by 
standards, measures and a quality infrastructure that will be in 
line with international guidelines.  They are currently seeking 
assistance to achieve these goals in the following key areas: 
 
--Awareness raising campaigns 
--Personnel and institutional capacity building 
--Analysis of training needs 
--Seminars and Workshops 
--Practical on-the-job training of specialists 
--International study tours

the National Institute for Standards and Technology are

fields of standardization and metrology.
