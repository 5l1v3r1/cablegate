ECONOMIC CHALLENGES 
 
REF: 09 SHANGHAI 25 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Managing the upcoming World Expo -- with 
particular attention to security  -- formed the centerpiece of 
Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng's work report to the January 26 opening 
of the annual session of the Municipal People's Congress.  Han 
did his best to stress Shanghai's 2009 achievements despite the 
fact the municipality posted its lowest rate of economic growth 
in nearly two decades.  Somewhat surprisingly, both Han's speech 
and the report delivered the previous day by the vice chairman 
of Shanghai's People's Political Consultative Congress largely 
avoided discussion of high housing and real estate prices, the 
issue of main concern to Shanghai residents.  Despite the 
reiteration of support for various economic and administrative 
reforms, Han's remarks, combined with the municipal leadership's 
understandable preoccupation with the Expo, suggests Shanghai's 
leaders will opt for caution with respect to any policy 
initiatives, at least over the coming year.  End summary. 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
Review of 2009: Accentuate the Positive (Forget About the 
Negative...) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In his work report to the January 26 opening of the 
Municipal People's Congress, Mayor Han Zheng put a positive spin 
on the achievements of 2009, a year in which the local economy 
faced problems "unprecedented" over the past two decades. 
According to Han, Shanghai posted a GDP growth rate of 8.2 
percent in 2009 -- a figure below the municipality's nine 
percent growth target and the lowest result since 1991. 
Nevertheless, fiscal revenue increased 7.7 percent, exceeding 
the target of six percent by nearly two percentage points 
despite the slowdown in GDP growth.  Fixed asset investment rose 
9.2 percent, and retail sales increased 14 percent over the 2008 
total.  In contrast, the consumer price index for the year 
declined 0.4 percent.  Urban and rural income both grew about 
eight percent, still quite positive but substantially slower 
than the double digit increases realized in 2008. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Although Han observed that exports and imports 
passing through the Shanghai customs area continued to account 
for about a quarter of China's total trade in 2009, he avoided 
noting that the overall trade volume had fallen by 15 percent in 
comparison to 2008.  Utilized foreign investment in 2009 totaled 
USD 10.54 billion, a relatively small increase of 4.5 percent of 
the previous year.  Han acknowledged Central Government approval 
of the plan to build a Disney theme park in Shanghai among the 
municipality's achievements in 2009. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Surprisingly, Han made only brief reference to some 
high-profile economic issues of the past year.  The official 
unemployment rate for 2009 was 4.3 percent -- below the targeted 
ceiling of 4.5 percent -- although the contribution of non-state 
firms to municipal GDP showed only a marginal increase, rising 
from 46 percent in 2008 to 47 percent in 2009.  Efforts to move 
 
SHANGHAI 00000028  002 OF 005 
 
 
Shanghai from an industrial to a service-based economy were more 
successful as the proportion of services in municipal GDP 
expanded to 59 percent from 53 percent a year earlier. 
According to Han, employment of university graduates, a 
prominent element in the 2009 work report, "was not lower than 
in past years."  Similarly, problems in housing, product safety, 
religious, minority affairs, and foreign affairs work received 
only cursory attention in the Mayor's work report.

Ensuring "Safe and Orderly" Expo Tops 2010 Goals 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  As expected, the upcoming World Expo was the 
centerpiece of the municipal government's work program for 2010, 
with "safe and orderly" (anquan youxu) as the main adjectives. 
(Discussion of the Expo and the various projects tied to it 
accounted for about five pages of Han's 40-page report.)  The 
mayor outlined measures such as increased food and product 
quality monitoring, strengthened traffic control, and periodic 
safety inspections of areas frequented by large numbers of 
visitors.  He also announced the establishment of a "safety and 
stability responsibility system" for Shanghai's residential 
districts indicating lower level leaders will be held 
accountable for problems in their jurisdictions that could 
disrupt the smooth operation of the Expo. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Apart from security, providing "service" to visitors 
occupied most of Han's Expo discussion in the report. 
Acknowledging the Expo as a chance to increase Shanghai's 
international influence and attractiveness, Han promised 
improved public transportation, signage, public hygiene, and 
overall "urban management."  (Comment:  The end of the section 
on the Expo in the Chinese text of Han's report finished with an 
exclamation point, indicating it should be an applause line. 
However, the mayor read the text with no additional emphasis, 
and the assembled delegates were silent as he moved on to the 
next section of his report.  End comment.) 
 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  The economic targets for 2010 announced by Mayor Han 
remain largely consistent with those of 2009.  Han announced GDP 
and fiscal revenue growth targets of eight percent each.  The 
official ceiling for unemployment remains at 4.5 percent.  Han 
revealed no targets, however, for fixed asset investment or 
retail sales.  Urban and rural incomes are set simply to 
"maintain steady growth." 
 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  The other main economic tasks for 2010 as listed in 
Han's report centered on: 
 
-- Following up the State Council decision to promote Shanghai's 
development as an international financial and transportation 
center; 
 
SHANGHAI 00000028  003 OF 005 
 
 
 
-- Continuing to build the municipality's capacity for 
"indigenous innovation"; 
 
-- Strengthening resource-use and environmental protection; 
 
-- Further integrating Shanghai's urban and rural areas 
particularly through the development of suburban "new towns"; 
 
-- Deepening economic reform, particularly through "experiments" 
underway in the enlarged Pudong New District; and 
 
-- Expanding Shanghai's openness to trade and investment both 
from overseas and from within China. 
 
 
 
(Comment:  Han spent a surprising amount of time in the report 
discussing efforts to improve rural welfare in Shanghai, an odd 
emphasis as the municipality's agricultural population accounts 
for less than 10 percent of total residents.  End comment.) 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
Employment, Not Housing, Remains Social Development Priority 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  Following the same ranking as in 2009, Shanghai's 
social development priorities as outlined by Han put expanding 
employment in the top position, followed by health and old age 
insurance, and, finally, housing.  Although Han acknowledged the 
problems many Shanghai residents have in finding affordable 
housing and promised to continue to expand the housing supply, 
he made no comment on the large jump in real estate prices 
during 2009. 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
Political Reform Section Mostly Covers Old Ground 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU)  The work report's final section, which focused on 
strengthening governance, called for simplification of the 
administrative approval process, greater transparency in 
regulation and decision-making, more effective provision of 
government services, stricter adherence by officials to the law 
in their work, and stronger measures against corruption, 
including through greater public supervision.  The only new 
content in this section of Han's report centered on simplifying 
the administrative approval process, which indicated additional 
authority may be devolved from the municipal government to 
Shanghai's district and county authorities.  All the other items 
largely mirrored the content of the 2009 work report.

Consultative Conference Session Highlights Role in Maintaining 
Stability 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
 
 
¶11.  (SBU)  The annual session of the Shanghai committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), 
which opened January 25, foreshadowed many of the same themes 
found in Mayor Han's work report to the Municipal People's 
Congress the following day.  With regard to the Shanghai Expo, 
Shanghai CPPCC Vice Chairman Zhou Taitong specifically focused 
in his report on security and "maintaining public order" during 
the six-month-long event.  He expressed concern about ensuring 
safe shipment of goods, protecting VIP visitors, maintaining 
orderly traffic flow, and ensuring food safety during the Expo. 
Organizing an event that would reflect well on Shanghai and 
promote economic development in the Yangtze River Delta region 
was a secondary consideration in the report. 
 
 
 
¶12.  (SBU)  Speaking on Shanghai's 2010 economic development 
objectives, Zhou offered little specificity and focused 
primarily on prospects for the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), 
which will be crafted during 2010.  He stressed many of the same 
themes as the current 11th Five-Year Plan -- economic 
rebalancing, resource demands, the rich-poor gap, economic 
transformation, etc. -- as continuing to be important in the 
near-term. (Comment: Like Han, Zhou avoided any discussion of 
rising housing prices, which have attracted a great deal of 
public attention in Shanghai in recent months.  End comment.) 
One CPPCC member who works for a multinational corporation told 
PolOff that Zhou's report included "nothing new" on the economy. 
 He complained that the Shanghai CPPCC Committee leadership was 
not "innovative enough" in its approach to economic reform in 
¶2010.  The businessman said he plans to raise the issue in the 
CPPCC's small group meetings during the week. 
 
 
 
¶13.  (SBU)  Recapping the events of 2009, Zhou stressed the 
CPPCC's role in offering policy recommendations on both the 
Shanghai Expo and economic development with the latter being 
especially challenging in the midst of the global financial 
crisis.  He also highlighted the local CPPCC's efforts to engage 
Shanghai's minority community following the July 5 ethnic unrest 
in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, 
notably through an open letter from CPPCC members representing 
minority and religious groups calling for public resistance to 
efforts to "split the Motherland."

Some Things Better Left Unsaid

SHANGHAI 00000028  005 OF 005 
 
 
 
¶14.  (SBU)  Comment:  Mayor Han's work report confirmed that 
Shanghai turned in a respectable but historically subpar 
economic performance in 2009.  Although Shanghai's ambitions to 
become a major international city are strong, they have been 
expressed to date largely in concrete and steel.  Measures 
called for in the work report for a more efficient, transparent, 
service-oriented, law-abiding, and honest administration are 
fundamentally needed to establish Shanghai as one of the world's 
leading financial and commercial centers.  As Shanghai steps 
into the spotlight with the biggest world's fair in history, 
however, Han's primary declared mission of delivering a "safe 
and orderly" Expo suggests such reforms are likely to take a 
backseat to maintaining the current level of control over the 
municipality's society and economy.  End comment.
