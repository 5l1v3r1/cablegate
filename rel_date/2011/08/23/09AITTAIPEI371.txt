¶1. ON MARCH 19, 2009, COMMERCIAL OFFICER ERIC CROWLEY AND FN CINDY 
CHANG VISITED THE INSTITUTE OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHY AT THE ADDRESS 
CITED IN PSV REQUEST CABLE TO CONDUCT A POST-SHIPMENT VERIFICATION. 
DURING THE VISIT POST MET WITH ASSISTANT RESEARCH FELLOW, DR. 
YUH-JING HWANG. 
 
¶2. THE INSTITUTE OF ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS (ASIAA), IS ONE OF 
THE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS UNDER ACADEMIA SINICA, WHICH IS THE PREMIER 
ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH INSTITUTION IN TAIWAN.  ACADEMIA SINICA WAS 
FOUNDED IN 1928, AND WHILE AFFILIATED DIRECTLY WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL 
OFFICE OF TAIWAN, ENJOYS SUBSTANTIAL AUTONOMY IN FORMULATING ITS 
RESEARCH OBJECTIVES.  THE ORGANIZATION'S MAJOR TASKS ARE TO 
UNDERTAKE IN-DEPTH ACADEMIC RESEARCH ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS IN THE 
SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES, AND TO PROVIDE GUIDELINES, CHANNELS OF 
COORDINATION, AND INCENTIVES IN ORDER TO RAISE ACADEMIC STANDARDS IN 
TAIWAN. 
 
¶3. ACCORDING TO DR. HWANG, THE CONTROLED TECHNOLOGY IN QUESTION IS 
BEING USED FOR A SUBMILLIMETER ARRAY (SMA) PROJECT THAT IS A 
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN ASIAA AND THE SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL 
OBSERVATORY (SAO).  THE ARRAY WAS DEDICATED ON MAUNA KEA, HAWAII IN 
NOVEMBER 2003 BY THE PREVIOUS PRESIDENT OF ACADEMIA SINICA (AND 
NOBEL PRIZE WINNER), YUAN TSEH LEE, AND THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION 
SECRETARY LARRY SMALL.  AS EXPLAINED BY DR. HWANG, THE SMA IS A 
RADIO INTERFEROMETER OPERATING IN THE ATMOSPHERIC WINDOWS CENTERED 
AT 230, 345, 400, AND 690 GHZ THAT CONSISTS OF EIGHT 6 METER RADIO 
TELESCOPES, WITH TWO OF THEM (INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED ELECTRONICS 
AND RECEIVER SYSTEMS) DELIVERED BY ASIAA.  THE SMA IS THE FIRST AND 
CURRENTLY THE ONLY ARRAY OPERATING IN SUBMILLIMETER WAVELENGTHS, AND 
PROVIDES A UNIQUE CAPABILITY TO OBSERVE WARM, DENSE GAS AND DUST AT 
UNPRECEDENTED HIGH ANGULAR RESOLUTIONS UP TO 0.1 ARC SECONDS IN 
EXTENT.  THE SMA'S RESEARCH FOCUS INCLUDES THE SOLAR SYSTEM, STAR 
AND PLANET FORMING REGIONS, EVOLVED STARS, AND GALAXIES AT NEARBY 
AND COSMOLOGICAL DISTANCES. 
 
¶4. ASIAA WAS OPEN AND COOPERATIVE AND MR. HWANG SHOWED US THEIR 
LABORTORY FACILITIES.  AIT WAS ALLOWED TO ENTER THEIR TESTING CENTER 
WHERE THE TWO CONTROLLED MULTIPLER CHAINS ARE LOCATED.  MR. HWANG 
SHOWED POST THEIR ORIGINAL EXPORT LICENSE APPLICATION AND CONFIRMED 
THAT THE CONTROLLED ITEMS ARE FOR THEIR OWN USE AND ONLY IN THE 
FACILITY VISITED BY POST. 
 
¶5. AIT FOUND NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT THE CONTROLLED PRODUCTS 
WERE USED FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN THOSE PROVIDED IN THE STATED END 
USE.
