  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"The U.S. stimulates its economy, China needs to benefit as well" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/05): "Although the American economic 
stimulus plan limits U.S. government procurements to American-made 
products, the regulations also allow the U.S. to buy products from 
countries that are a part of the GPA agreement of the WTO.  China 
has joined the GPA negotiations but is not yet a GPA member.  At 
this time, the U.S. government has a legal basis not to purchase 
Chinese goods.  China's 'government procurement law' has similar 
rules to purchase native goods.  The amount of Chinese goods in the 
U.S. procurement market will not be influenced because, in the past, 
it has not been large.  China should step up their negotiations with 
the GPA in order to enter the U.S. procurement market.  However, 
China lacks the sense to purchase only native goods; instead the 
country tends to purchase foreign goods.  If China were to also only 
purchase native goods, the U.S. would become more worried than 
China.  The 'Illegal exclusion native goods' should be opposed in 
China and government procurement should instead emphasize purchasing 
native goods.  China's endeavor to enter the GPA was inspired by 
Obama's 'buy American' bill.  China needs to request that other 
countries are accepting of Chinese companies and their goods. This 
will allow Chinese goods a share in other countries' government 
procurement markets.  China should use international law to compete 
for the interests of the Chinese economy." 
 
¶2. NORTH KOREA 
 
"Are the U.S. and China opponents or friends on the North Korea 
nuclear issue?" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/05): "Recently some in the international 
society doubted China's role in the North Korean nuclear issue. 
These people even think that the U.S. and China could become 
opponents over the issue.  However, the core conflict lies with the 
relationship between the U.S. and North Korea.  North Korea's 
repeated mistrustful behavior has lost them the trust of the U.S. 
China is the only recognized go-between negotiator for the U.S. and 
North Korea.  China is the necessary path to take if Washington 
wants to look for a communication point with North Korea.  Since 
2003, China's role as the host of the Six-Party Talks has been 
recognized by all parties.  The talks have successfully resolved 
obstacles for U.S.-North Korea relations. There are now bilateral 
talks under a multilateral framework. Today, although there is noise 
concerning China, the U.S. and the North Korea issue, the two 
countries have common interests that bond them together.  The U.S. 
and China can only be friends and can never be opponents.  Otherwise 
the North Korea nuclear issue will not resolve and the peninsula 
will not be security." 
 
¶3. JUNE 4 ANNIVERSARIES 
 
"Clinton's June 4 comments 'disregarded facts'" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (06/05): "China 
yesterday expressed deep dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to 
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's remarks on the 20th 
anniversary of the events of June 4.  "As to the political turmoil 
and problems that happened in the late 1980s, the Communist Party of 
China and the Chinese government have already made a clear 
conclusion," Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said at a regular 
press conference in response to a question about a statement 
released by Clinton on Wednesday.  He said China had made great 
advances in economic and social development since the country began 
its reforms and opened up 30 years ago.  Facts had proven that the 
path of socialism with Chinese characteristics suited the national 
conditions of China.  The remarks from the U.S. disregarded the 
facts and made random accusations against the Chinese government, 
Qin said, adding that Clinton's comments violated basic norms 
governing international relations and principles set forth in the 
three China-U.S. joint communiqus and grossly interfered in China's 
internal affairs. 
"We urge the U.S. to put aside its political prejudices and correct 
its wrong-doings so as to avoid interfering with and damaging 
Sino-U.S. relations," Qin said."
