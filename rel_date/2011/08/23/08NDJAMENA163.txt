OBSERVERS FOR DAKAR PEACE PROCESS 
 
REF: LIBREVILLE 293 
 
¶1.  (U) THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE:  SEE PARA 6. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  UN SRSG VICTOR ANGELO TOLD THE AMBASSADOR 4/16 
THAT A UN FORCE OF 100-150 MILITARY OBSERVERS COULD BE PLACED 
RELATIVELY QUICKLY ALONG THE CHAD-SUDAN BORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE 
DAKAR PEACE ACCORD IF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL (UNSC) WERE TO AGREE 
TO EXPAND THE MINURCAT MANDATE.  HE ASKED OUR OPINION OF THE IDEA. 
WE SAID WE THOUGHT IT MERITED FULL CONSIDERATION AND WOULD ADVISE 
WASHINGTON OF HIS PROPOSAL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MAKE MINURCAT "THE SPINE" OF MILOB BORDER FORCE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶3.  (SBU) SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL VICTOR 
ANGELO TOLD AMBASSADOR APRIL 16 THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING PROPOSING TO 
THE SYG THAT MINURCAT'S MANDATE BE EXPANDED TO MAKE IT RESPONSIBLE 
FOR A MILITARY OBSERVATION FORCE ALONG THE CHAD-SUDAN BORDER TO 
IMPLEMENT THE DAKAR PEACE ACCORD.  ANGELO SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE 
DAKAR PROCESS GAVE RESPONSIBUILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACCORD 
TO THE ALL-AFRICAN CONTACT GROUP, THE GROUP HAD FEW MEANS AND LITTLE 
EXPERTISE IN ESTABLISHING AND RUNNING A PKO LIKE A MILITARY BORDER 
OBSERVATION FORCE. THE UN OF COURSE HAS BOTH. ANGELO ESTIMATED THAT 
A MILOBS FORCE OF 150-200 PERSONNEL COULD DO THE JOB.  HE SAID THAT 
MINURCAT, ALREADY PROTECTED BY EUFOR, IS WELL-PLACED TO CARRY OUT 
SUCH A MISSION. IT WOULD REQUIRE ONLY AN EXPANSION OF MINURCAT'S 
MANDATE BY THE UNSDC TO INCLUDE A MILOBS BORDER MISSION FOR MINURCAT 
TO GET TO WORK.  FORCE PROTECTION WOULD BE PROVIDED BY EUFOR (AS 
ALREADY PROVIDED FOR IN THE UNSC RESOLUTION.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) ANGELO SAID THAT IF HE WERE GIVEN A MILOBS BORDER 
OBSERVATION MANDATE, HE WOULD FIRST REQUEST PERSONNEL FROM THE 
CONTACT GROUP COUNTRIES - SENEGAL, LIBYA, GABON, AND ERITREA - THEN 
SEEK PERSONNEL FROM OTHER MUSLIM COUNTRIES, AFRICAN AND NON-AFRICAN. 
ANGELO SAID THAT MINURCAT COULD COORDINATE ITS MILOBS MANDATE WITH 
UNAMID ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHAD-SUDAN BORDER.  ANGELO NOTED 
THAT THIS IDEA WAS COST-EFFECTIVE, CREDIBLE, AND RELATIVELY EASY TO 
PUT IN PLACE. 
 
¶5. (SBU  COMMENT:  THIS STRIKES US HERE AS A SOUND IDEA. EUFOR HAS 
THE MANDATE TO PROTECT AND ASSIST MINURCAT.  EXPANDING MINURCAT'S 
MANDATE TO INCLUDE MOUNTING A MILOBS BORDER OPERATION ALONG THE 
BORDER WOULD GET CHADIAN ASSENT, WE BELIEVE. SUCH A FORCE WOULD BE 
ABLE TO PROVIDE A NEUTRAL AND CREDIBLE ACCOUNT OF CROSS-BORDER 
INCURSIONS AND DISCOURAGE BOTH SIDES FROM SUCH INCURSIONS. 
CURRENTLY THE UN AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS ONLY THE 
"WARRING COMMUNIQUES" ISSUED BY CHAD AND SUDAN AS TESTIMONY TO WHAT 
IS HAPPENING ON THE BORDER.  WE DO NOT KNOW HOW KHARTOUM OR LIBYA 
WOULD REACT. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER ACTING IN 
NEW YORK TO EXPLORE THE IDEA OF AN EXPANSION OF MINURCAT'S MANDATE 
TO INCLUDE A BORDER MILOBS MISSION SUCH AS THE SRSG HAS PROPOSED 
 
¶7.  (U) TRIPOLI MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
