¶2. MFA Spokesperson Jiang Yu said EAP A/S Christopher Hill, 
Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei and DPRK Vice Foreign Minister 
Kim Gye-gwan held meetings today in Beijing to exchange ideas 
on the Six-Party Talks and issues of common interest.  The 
meetings included both bilateral and trilateral meetings, but 
Jiang repeatedly deflected questions regarding bilateral 
meetings between the United States and DPRK envoys and why a 
Russian envoy did not attend the talks.  VFM Wu also met with 
Kenichiro Sasae of Japan and Vice Foreign Minster Chun 
Young-Woo of the ROK. 
 
DPRK to Re-enter Six-Party Talks Boldly after Nuclear Test 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶3. Asked to comment on DPRK VFM Kim's statement that the DPRK 
can re-enter the Six-Party Talks boldly after taking the 
necessary defensive measures through the nuclear test and 
stressing that the DPRK is now a nuclear nation, Jiang said 
that China's position is consistent, clear-cut and firm in 
opposing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and in 
supporting the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
China believes the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and 
UNSC Resolution 1718 have clearly stated the consensus of the 
international community and hopes that all parties can take 
full use of this opportunity to take flexible and 
constructive attitudes for an in-depth exchange of ideas so 
as to create conditions for the re-launching and early 
success of the Six-Party Talks. 
 
Hu, Bush Converse by Phone

¶4. In response to a question regarding the contents of last 
night's phone conversation between President Hu and President

States-China relations and issues of common interest. 
 
China Welcomes Diplomatic Ties with Central American Countries 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶5. China is prepared to have normal state-to-state relations 
with the countries of Central America currently without 
formal diplomatic ties to China based on the five principles 
of peaceful coexistence and the UN Charter, said Jiang when 
asked for comment on Nicaraguan President-elect Daniel 
Ortega's expressed interest in establishing diplomatic 
relations with China. 
 
Joint Statement and Free Trade Agreement from Hu's Visit to 
Pakistan

neighbors.  Jiang also mentioned the signing of a free trade 
agreement and a five-year cooperative plan during the visit.

issue, said Jiang when asked for comment on the possible 
discussion of Darfur at the African Union Summit set to take 
place in Abuja, Nigeria on November 29.  China appreciates 
the diplomatic efforts of all parties and believes that now 
is a key moment for solving the issue, Jiang stated.
