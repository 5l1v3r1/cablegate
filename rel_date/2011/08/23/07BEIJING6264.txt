SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) China unveiled its new national recall system for toys and 
processed food on August 31, a program spearheaded by the General 
Administration for Quality Supervision, Administration, and 
Quarantine (AQSIQ), the regulatory agency in charge of inspection 
for some aspects of domestic production and consumption of food as 
well as all aspects of export product certification and safety.  An 
AQSIQ contact subsequently told Econoffs that the new toy recall 
system is not significantly different from the previous one, but the 
food recall system has been strengthened.  The new rules now codify 
the definition of unsafe foods and defective toys and also establish 
requirements for manufacturers and the rest of the supply chain in 
the recall process.  Local and provincial governments shoulder 
responsibility for regular-sized and voluntary recalls, and AQSIQ at 
the national level takes control of larger and compulsory recalls. 
Our contact said that no new funds would be allocated to support the 
rollout of the national system, but the agency will request 
additional funds if needed.  The recall system is expected to 
utilize existing staffing.  The new rules do not address the recall 
of food and toys intended for export.  END SUMMARY 
 
A NEW AND UNFUNDED RECALL SYSTEM 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) China announced its new national recall system for food and 
consumer products on August 31, a program spearheaded by the General 
Administration for Quality Supervision, Administration, and 
Quarantine (AQSIQ), the regulatory agency in charge of testing any 
product certified for export and some production sectors related to 
domestic consumption.  (The recall regulations were promulgated on 
August 27.)  AQSIQ Department Policy and Legislation Director 
General Liu Zhaobin told Econoffs September 10 that the new food and 
toy recall systems were not different from the ones that existed 
before -- China has conducted food product recalls for years, and an 
automotive recall system was implemented in 2005 -- but the new 
rules now codify the definition of unsafe foods and defective toys 
and also establish requirements for manufacturers and the rest of 
the supply chain in the recall process.  The new rules do not 
address the recall of food and toys intended for export, areas for 
which Liu said AQSIQ would later issue detailed guidance. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The food recall system establishes voluntary recalls in 
Categories I, II, and III for decreasing severity of harm to human 
health, and the affected products must be banned for sale within 
one, two, and three days, respectively.  Compliance is monitored at 
the provincial level.  When producers fail to respect the terms of 
voluntary recall or fail to remedy violations, AQSIQ can mandate a 
compulsory recall and take charge of monitoring the recall from the 
national level.  For toys, manufacturers are required to take 
voluntary, prompt action when they discover defects.  No specific 
deadline is imposed for implementing a ban on their sale, and AQSIQ 
can escalate the voluntary recall to a compulsory recall. The new 
rules establish fixed criminal penalties of 10-30,000 RMB (USD 1,300 
- 4,000) for failure to stop the sale of hazardous food or toys, 
comply with recall procedures, or rectify violations.  Corruption by 
officials is subject to both criminal and administrative penalties 
in cases of hazardous food and administrative punishment in cases of 
defective toys. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Liu said that no new funds would be allocated to support a 
nationwide rollout of the recall systems.  At the provincial level, 
the rollout will utilize existing staffing.  However, AQSIQ is 
expanding its headquarters office in Beijing to manage the recall 
 
BEIJING 00006264  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
system from the center and has said it will request additional funds 
from the Ministry of Finance if needed.  Recalls for products not 
under AQSIQ's purview, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, are 
handled separately by the Ministry of Agriculture or other 
responsible agencies.  This division of labor is necessary, Liu 
commented, because one single agency would be unable to manage every 
recall.  The State Council Leading Group on Food Safety and Product 
Quality is studying interagency coordination. (Note: The Leading 
Group, Liu said, was meeting across the hall at the same time as our 
own meeting.  This is the first unpublicized meeting of the Leading 
Group.)  The Leading Group meets every ten calendar days to resolve 
"friction" between agencies and improve coordination on food and 
product safety matters, Liu said, adding that he usually 
participates in the Leading Group meetings. 
 
AUTO RECALLS AS A MODEL 
----------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) AQSIQ introduced China's first official recall system, for 
automobiles, in 2005, resulting in the recall of 125,000 vehicles 
from 40 manufacturers since that time, and then used it as a model 
for the food and toy recall systems now in place.  The major 
difference between the food/toy recalls and auto recalls is the 
introduction of the new concept of compulsory and voluntary recalls, 
the former managed by AQSIQ national headquarters and the latter 
managed by local Technical Supervision Bureaus (TSBs).  (Note: TSBs 
are the 31 mainland province legacy inspection agencies that were 
folded into AQSIQ at the agency's creation in May 2001 and now 
co-exist with and complement AQSIQ's provincial CIQ offices. End 
Note) 
 
NEW REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Regulators are now discussing the establishment of a 
general method for recalls in any product area, under the direction 
of the State Council Legislative Affairs Office.  Food, toys, 
medicines, and agricultural products will continue to have their own 
recall systems, but a general system will cover everything else. 
Officials are also planning strengthened recall systems for 
medicines and building materials.  China is still interested in 
learning from U.S. experience, Liu said, as it expands and improves 
its own recall systems. 
 
¶7. (SBU) China is amending the Law on Standardization and the Law on 
Metrology, and will also contribute to a new Law on Food Safety. 
Follow-up conversations with AQSIQ revealed that this new Law on 
Food Safety would supplement the existing 1995 Law on Food Hygiene, 
which deals with the implementation of a food sanitation license 
system.  AQSIQ will submit initial proposals/amendments on all three 
laws to the State Council. Liu did not indicate when the Food Safety 
Law draft would be completed. 
 
FOUR-MONTH CAMPAIGN MAKES PROGRESS 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Liu said that the State Council-initiated four-month 
special campaign from August through the end of the year targets 
"important" products, regions, industries, and large-scale safety 
problems.  Across AQSIQ's 30,000 employees, Liu said that 150,000 
inspection work shifts had checked the certifications of 1,830,000 
companies.   (Note: A follow-up call to AQSIQ to confirm the types 
of companies inspected and the time period over which such an 
incredible number of inspections were conducted revealed no new 
information.  According to the State Council White Paper "The 
Quality and Safety of Food in China," China has 448,000 food 
production and processing enterprises, so the 1,830,000 figure for 
inspected companies likely includes a wide range of consumer and 
perhaps even industrial product manufacturers. End Note.)  When 
 
BEIJING 00006264  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
asked by Econoff how progress in the campaign would be measured, Liu 
said that auditors would be dispatched to local CIQ offices to 
measure local CIQ and manufacturer compliance with the range of new 
rules that cover everything from registration of firms to management 
of inspection records. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) While this regulation provides for clarifications to 
AQSIQ's role in the existing comprehensive food recall system, it 
does not provide details about the competent authorities for each 
action.  This is an important omission because AQSIQ is responsible 
for only one portion of China's domestic regulation and enforcement 
of food safety.  By not including the duties and responsibilities of 
the other ministries, the impact of this new regulation must be 
questioned.  By inference, this change in regulation only applies to 
the recall of food that is regulated by AQSIQ.  If this is the case, 
a significant part of China's food will not be covered by the 
regulation. 
 
¶10. (SBU) The rollout of strengthened recall systems for food and 
toys amounts to an unfunded mandate for AQSIQ.  The ability of the 
central government to punish violators will depend on the 
professionalism of local CIQ officials and perhaps a heavy hand from 
the national AQSIQ office, rather than an infusion of new inspectors 
to canvass each province.  Regulators are relying on that same sense 
of professionalism -- and new penalties on corrupt practices -- to 
crack down on violators in the four-month special campaign. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Meanwhile, it appears that a broad awareness of food and 
product safety is trickling down from the center to provincial 
authorities.  AQSIQ Minister Li Changjiang, Party Secretary Li 
Chuanqing, and a third official (Ref. A) are visiting local offices 
around the country for the next several months.  AQSIQ auditors are 
expected to visit local CIQ offices in December.  Officials at the 
WTO Center in Shanghai and academics at the Chongqing Academy of 
Social Sciences indicated to a Beijing Econoff in early September 
that China is taking food and product safety very seriously.
