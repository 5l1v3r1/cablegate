SUBJECT: MAY 12 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: CONTINENTAL SHELF, SRI LANKA, 
KOREAN PENINSULA, NEPAL STABILITY 
 
¶1. Key points at the May 12 MFA press briefing: 
 
-- China has submitted information to the UN on the outer limits of 
its continental shelf. 
 
-- The work of Chinese companies in building a port in Sri Lanka is 
"a normal business action" and reports that it is otherwise are 
"distortions" and "groundless." 
 
-- "Maintaining peace and stability" on the Korean Peninsula is "in 
the interest of all parties." 
 
-- A report claiming China is behind unrest in Nepal is "baseless." 
 
 
Continental Shelf 
----------------- 
 
¶2. Based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and 
agreements between the signatories, China's permanent representative 
to the UN submitted information on the outer limits of China's 
continental shelf -- to 200 nautical miles offshore, said MFA 
spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu at the May 12 regularly scheduled press 
conference.  The submission touches upon China's territory in the 
South China Sea, Ma noted.  Ma added that China has "indisputable 
sovereignty and jurisdiction" over the islands of the South China 
Sea and the surrounding waters. China reserves the right to submit 
further information on this issue in the future, said Ma. 
 
Sri Lanka 
--------- 
 
¶3. Press reports indicate that China has begun construction of a 
naval facility in Hambantota, Sri Lanka, to use as a refueling 
docking station for its navy and to assist Sri Lankan forces combat 
rebels.  Critics have accused China of supporting human rights 
abuses in the country.  In response to a question, the spokesman 
said that China wishes to develop relations with Sri Lanka "based on 
the five principles of peaceful coexistence," said Ma.  The work of 
Chinese companies in building the port in Sri Lanka is "a normal 
business action" and reports that it is otherwise are "distortions" 
and "groundless."  Ethnic reconciliation and social stability are in 
the interests of the Sri Lankan people, said Ma.  China continues to 
follow the situation in Sri Lanka and will provide assistance 
"within its abilities." 
 
North Korea 
------------ 
 
¶4. "Maintaining peace and stability" on the Korean peninsula is "in 
the interest of all parties" and China hopes that all parties will 
"proceed from this understanding," said Ma. 
 
Nepal Instability 
----------------- 
 
¶5. A report claiming China is behind unrest in Nepal is "baseless," 
said Ma.  China abides by the principle of noninterference in others 
affairs.  As a friendly neighbor, China hopes Nepal will "remain 
united" to promote peace and stability. 
 
Asia-Europe Summit 
------------------ 
 
¶6. China places "great importance" on the Asia-Europe meeting to be 
held in Hanoi from May 25-26.  Due to scheduling conflicts, Foreign 
Minister Yang Jiechi will not be able to attend, said Ma.  Vice 
Foreign Minister Wu Dawei will attend on behalf of Yang.  China 
hopes the meeting will work to implement the consensus reached at 
the previous Asia-Europe summit which was held in Beijing.  China 
will also work to promote the "four initiatives" outlined by Prime 
Minister Wen Jiabao at the previous meeting. 
 
Earthquake 
----------- 
 
¶7. Asked about foreign contributions to the Sichuan Earthquake 
reconstruction, Ma said that President Hu Jintao had "extended his 
gratitude" to foreign nations for their assistance in reconstruction 
after last year's Sichuan earthquake.  Ma added that reconstruction 
work has been proceeding "smoothly" and survivors are building new 
homes and developing the economy.
