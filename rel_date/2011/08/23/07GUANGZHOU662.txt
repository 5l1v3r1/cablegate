¶1.  (SBU) Acting Admin Officer and Guangzhou Design Institute (GZDI) 
met with the Director for Consular Affairs of the Guangzhou Foreign 
Affairs Office Luo Jun and members of the Guangzhou Urban Planning 
Office (UPO) on June 6 to discuss UPO's proposed design changes of 
the NCC.  Prior to the meeting, the consulate sent the FAO and UPO 
two official letters (but not via Dip note) re changes UPO had 
requested on the Master Plan.  One letter simply asked for a 
complete list of issues from the UPO perspective and the other, 
drafted by SOM, focused on the perimeter fence and the Vehicle CAC 
which UPO had asked be modified or changed. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At the meeting, the UPO asked the U.S. side to present a 
Dip Note about the Perimeter Fence (the Wall and Clear Fence), which 
would then be reviewed at the highest level.  UPO wants a clear 
fence (chain link) surrounding the compound that would not exceed 
2.5 meters; the Master Plan's wall is currently not acceptable UPO's 
perspective.  Our Dip Note will provide exact specifications and a 
note about the security reasons for a solid wall.  (In the future, 
per Luo Jun's request, such requests will be sent via Dip Note to 
the FAO for coordination.  Luo Jun and Admin officer will track each 
specific request and resolve issues or move problems up to the nest 
level or to Beijing for discussion.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As for the Vehicle CAC, we asked the UPO to reply to our 
original official request regarding outstanding issues and were 
informed we would receive UPOP's response next week.  UPO, noting a 
concern raised by police (who were not present at the meeting), said 
the U.S. needed only two, not three entrance gates, and that the 
gates should be located on the main street, not on the side streets. 
 GZDI explained the need for the three gates and necessity for the 
design location but we are at an impasse on this point. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Currently we are waiting for the wall specifications from 
SOM so we can draft a Dip Note and the complete (as stated by the 
UPO) list of changes requested by UPO.
