Climate Change Conference Results 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  At the December 22 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Jiang Yu denied accusations that China 
"hijacked" the climate conference, insisting that China made strong 
efforts at COP-15.  China's attitude and effectiveness are "on par" 
with every other country, she said.  No deals were made with any 
countries to achieve a particular outcome, she emphasized, adding 
that because developed countries did not honor their commitments, 
they are in no position to criticize developing countries. 
Responding to a statement that China could make a greater effort on 
climate change, Jiang stated that the COP-15 conference was a new 
beginning to press ahead on commitments. 
 
Death Sentence for UK Citizen 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. Regarding UK citizen Akmal Shaikh, who was sentenced to death for 
drug smuggling despite claims that he suffers from mental disorders, 
Jiang said judicial authorities handled the situation in accordance 
with the law.  Drug smuggling is a serious crime in China, and Mr. 
Shaikh's rights were respected and consular visits were arranged, 
she insisted.  Asked if an execution order has been formally issued 
and if diplomats may attend any proceedings, Jiang said these 
questions should be referred to the proper public security 
authorities. 
 
Cambodia's Handing Uighurs Over to China Not Influenced by Aid 
---------------------------- --------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Accusations that Cambodia handed 20 Uighur "criminals" to China 
to preserve PRC aid are groundless, said Jiang.  These "criminals" 
are in violation of both PRC and Cambodian border entry/exit laws, 
she said.  This is an internal legal issue of China, and no one 
should be pointing fingers because the law will be followed, said 
Jiang.  She reiterated that no strings were attached to aid. 
Regarding questions as to the Uighurs' whereabouts, Jiang said that 
the question would be better directed to public security 
authorities. 
 
Hu Jintao Visit to Japan a Positive Step 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. With Japan's new government in power, Vice President Xi Jinping 
has made a successful visit to Japan, meeting with people "from all 
walks of life" and working towards long-term stability to serve the 
two countries' common interests, said Jiang. 
 
China Respects Romania's Path Forward as a Sovereign Country 
------------------------- ---------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Asked for a comment on the twentieth anniversary of Romania's 
liberation from communism, Jiang mentioned that China respects the 
social system and path of development determined by countries for 
their own benefit.  The relationship between Romania and China 
remains strong because both countries respect each others' 
sovereignty. 
 
Nepalese PM to Visit China 
-------------------------- 
 
¶7. Nepalese Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal will make his first 
official visit to China from December 26 - 31.  Specifics of the 
visit are yet to be determined.  Asked if China will treat this new 
government differently than the previous Maoist government, Jiang 
replied that China always supported the Nepalese government and its 
path to development.  "Its internal issues are just that, internal 
issues," she said.  China hopes for the sake of peace Nepal can 
achieve national reconciliation.
