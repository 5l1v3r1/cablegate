SUBJECT:  Ma May Not Make It -- Xiamen University Taiwan 
Experts Expect Horse Race Still for Ma Ying-jeou

¶1. (SBU) Summary: A prominent Xiamen University Taiwan 
Research Institute professor said that PRC leaders should 
not be complacent in assuming that Kuomintang (KMT) leader 
Ma Ying-jeou is a shoo-in to be the island's next 
president.  PRC leaders have consistently underestimated 
the intensity of Taiwan identity, especially when 
potentially manipulated by someone like Taiwan President 
Chen Shui-pian against Ma.  So even though the economic and 
personal linkages between Taiwan and Fujian citizens grow 
stronger by the day, the political landscape is likely to 
remain unsettled for some time.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Passing through Xiamen as part of the Consulate's 
"long march" through the Hakka and Minnan heartland of 
eastern Guangdong and western Fujian, Congenoffs hosted a 
Saturday luncheon with representatives of the Taiwan 
Research Institute (TRI) of Xiamen University.  The 
Institute's Director and Deputy Director were not 
available, traveling in Taiwan at the time in order to 
accompany prominent Taiwan academics to Xiamen for the 
university's 80th anniversary, but Political Science 
Professor Chen Kongli sat in as the heavyweight of the 
group that met with us, accompanied on the political side 
by TRI Political Department Chief Sun Yun, his deputy Zhang 
Wensheng, and Shi Zhengfang representing the economics side 
of the institute. 
 
Economic, Familial, Hometown Ties Stronger By The Minute 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
¶3.  (SBU) The mention that the Consulate party had just 
come from Zhangzhou, home to the third largest 
concentration (following Suzhou and Dongguan) of Taiwan 
business people and their families essentially residing 
permanently on the mainland, elicited a discussion of the 
strong economic, familial, and hometown ties that were 
developing all throughout the Hakka and Minnan regions that 
the Consulate party was traveling through.  These are the 
homeland regions of most Taiwanese.  Hence, Meizhou is the 
home area of KMT heavyweight Wu Poh-hsiung and a major 
Hakka leader in Taiwan.  Zhangzhou, for its part, is the 
home town of luminaries such former KMT Presidential 
contender Lien Chan and also plays host to a number of 
Taiwan ventures in a huge array of industries, not the 
least of which is agricultural product development. 
Zhangzhou is also the home area of prominent "independence" 
advocates such as Lu Hsiu-lien (Annette Lu) and Taiwan 
President Chen Shui-pian itself. 
 
Ma As the White Horse? 
---------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) The fly in the ointment in these strong and still 
growing cross-straits ties is, of course, political and 
foreign relations.  Political chief Sun commented that the 
recent visit by KMT head Ma Ying-jeou to the U.S. was being 
portrayed in the Chinese media as an indication not only of 
the U.S. displeasure with Chen Shui-pian but also as a 
suggestion that the U.S. was supporting a Taiwan figure 
such as Ma who, because he had reconfirmed the "1992 
consensus," was someone who was not unilaterally altering 
the situation in the Taiwan straits.  Sun commented that 
the U.S. had seemingly been careful not to talk about Ma as 
the U.S. candidate and that, for their part, the Chinese 
authorities had also been careful not to be seen as overly 
enthusiastic by Ma's trip, lest there be a backlash in 
Taiwan. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) At this point Professor Chen commented that 
notwithstanding this careful public affairs stance by the 
PRC, a number of Chinese leaders have told him that they 
saw the future election of Ma as Taiwan's president as very 
likely.  Yes, Ma had a good track record as Taipei mayor, 
yes, he has a degree of charisma, and yes, he is the sole 
major Taiwan figure who is endorsing the "1992 consensus," 
but -- Professor Chen emphasized -- Ma is a mainlander, 
and, like it or not, Taiwan identity remains important to 
 
GUANGZHOU 00011045  002 OF 002 
 
 
sufficiently large a core group of the Taiwan electorate 
such that Ma is by no means a sure thing in a future 
election.  Moreover, Chinese leaders do not like Chen Shui- 
pian, but they should not be blind to the fact that 
President Chen is a master politician, quite capable of 
mounting a major political attack against Ma, even if Ma 
was by far the better mayor of Taipei.  Therefore, China's 
cross-straits strategy should not be based on what might be 
a false assumption. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶6.  (SBU) The TRI is the oldest Taiwan watching academic 
institution in China and is generally seen as having the 
most insight into Taiwan domestic politics.  Professor 
Chen, for his part, is one of the oldest and most 
experienced of Xiamen University's cadre of Taiwan 
watchers, and while he avoided predictions about the 
outcome of any future Taiwan presidential election, he 
probably is correct that the dynamics of the contest will 
be complex indeed.
