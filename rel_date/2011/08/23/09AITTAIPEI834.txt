visited Gon Cheng Precision Instruments Co. Ltd in Pingtung City, 
Taiwan and interviewed the company's Manager, Jason Lee.  AIT/K also 
conducted telephone interviews with Commander Tang Chen-gung, the

of the Taiwan Air Force.

American supplier, Thomas Electronics, from his research on the 
internet.  He received his order from Thomas Electronics on May 26, 
¶2008. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Lee told us that his main customer for the past seven 
years has been the Taiwan military.  He claimed he does not do 
business outside of Taiwan, nor does he operate offices overseas. 
Lee said he signed an agreement not to transfer this equipment to a 
third party and claimed he was familiar with U.S. restrictions on 
the procurement of USML items.

an OS208/UPM-137 oscilloscope used for radar testing.  Tang also 
confirmed that Gon Cheng is a reliable supplier and contractor for 
Taiwan's Air Force.
