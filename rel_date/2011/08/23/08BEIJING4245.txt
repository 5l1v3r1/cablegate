  Editorial Quotes

FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
a. "How far away is the new international financial order?" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(11/17): "The 
Summit did not make any substantial progress. The truth of the 
financial storm is not clearly seen. The truth is very hard to 
attain because of the following reasons: first, the financial storm 
began in developed countries, specifically in the U.S. who occupies 
a hegemonic position in political and economic fields. Second, 
prices of U.S. financial assets have misled and disillusioned the 
World about the global financial market. No one really knows how 
fatal the financial crisis really will be for the U.S. and for the 
World. Third, the international financial institutes are inclined 
towards developed countries and their functions have been twisted 
away from reality. The establishment of a new financial order will 
depend on when people have a profound recognition of the financial 
crisis. No one can give an answer as to how long the crisis will 
last, or if it is close to an end or has just begun." 
 
b. "What is China's tactic to deal with the financial crisis?" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(11/17): "As the 
global financial crisis and the economic recession continue, an 
important historical chance for China has emerged. If China grasps 
this opportunity, it will decide its position in the future 
international financial situation. China should consider seeking a 
strategic position. China should actively participate in the 
international financial system and bring out its own ideas; China 
should use the identity of a developing country to fight for the 
interests of developing countries; China could make use of the 
crisis to advocate and initiate some international cooperation and 
promote a new international political situation." 
 
c. "The system of questioning should focus on the U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/17): "The U.S. usually likes to call on 
other countries, other responsible stakeholders, asking them to 
cooperate with and play their game. An international questioning 
system should be created because the financial crisis has caused a 
lot of bitterness in the people of developing countries. The 
trouble-maker country should take on its own responsibilities. The 
questioning system should primarily keep an eye on the U.S. 
Developing countries should have courage and confidence to dare to 
question the U.S. during this time. The responsibilities that 
Washington should take on, as the leader of the global financial 
system, have become the focus of the summit. Without clarifying 
their responsibilities, without strictly restraining the behavior of 
the U.S., the World's long-term interests will be severely 
damaged."
