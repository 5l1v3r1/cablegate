cooperation throughout the region is the key to IPR 
enforcement success. 
 
¶30. (SBU) Tom Hipelius from the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement IPR 
Coordination Center noted substantial improvement in 
cooperation with Chinese law enforcement agencies.  He 
pointed out that, whereas written requests for 
meetings with Chinese counterparts went unanswered in 
2001, by 2004 the two governments were carrying out 
joint undercover operations.  He noted particular 
successes in the case of Vincent Ku, who was selling 
counterfeit Microsoft products, as well as a 
pharmaceutical case codenamed Ocean Crossing.  DHS 
Customs and Border Patrol's (CBP) Steve Thomas 
reported 14,675 IPR seizures in 2006, noting that 81 
percent of IPR border seizures were from shipments 
originating in China.  He underscored CBP's positive 
working relationship with the General Administration 
of Customs of China (GACC) and other Chinese agencies. 
Thomas added that CBP and GACC had signed an IPR 
memorandum of understanding that became effective in 
June, allowing for more information sharing on IPR 
seizures. 
 
Initial Feedback from Attendees 
------------------------------- 
 
¶31. (SBU) Direct and indirect feedback via surveys, 
blogs, and web postings give a fairly comprehensive 
account of the success of this year's Roundtable and 
ongoing challenges in protecting IPR.  Attendees 
generally ranked the roundtable as "highly valuable" 
to them, noting in particular the utility of a forum 
to educate the United States Mission on how to better 
support industry.  Attendees also offered that 
recommending practical steps to support rights holders 
was a challenging, useful exercise that prompted 
follow-up in their own organizations.  One association 
has reportedly already suggested to the Ministry of 
Public Security how to coordinate more closely on 
criminal copyright enforcement cases -- in effect, a 
first practical consequence of the IPR Roundtable. 
 
¶34. (SBU) The Mission's initial analysis shows a 
consistent message from industry: there continues to 
be a compelling need for increased interagency 
cooperation and coordination in IPR issues, including 
cooperation with legislative and judicial branches. 
Also, many industry participants openly criticized the 
United States Government's WTO case, suggesting that 
it undercuts their efforts to improve enforcement by 
working with IPR officials.  One trade association 
representative said they saw "little purpose" in 
visiting Beijing because of the WTO case, while others 
explained that their China budgets had been cut, thus 
precluding their attendance.  This new dynamic on IPR
