This is CWC-11-09. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is an action request; see para 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 20, Delreps Clagett, Ferguson, 
Prather, and Robinson met with the new Libyan 
Permanent Representative to the OPCW Ambassador 
Ahmed Al Walid and Mr. Mohadeb Gheton of the Libyan 
delegation to try to obtain more specific 
information on the status of the Rabta conversion 
and Libyan preparations for CW destruction. 
Dr.Fathi Asseid, the only technical expert Tripoli 
sent to EC-55, had already departed for Tripoli. 
Unfortunately, neither Libyan rep was able to 
provide any additional detail.  Delreps reiterated 
the importance of Libyan transparency on the status 
of both projects.  Delreps recommended that Libya 
present a non-paper clearly explaining the 
technical status of both projects, including 
details of any problems encountered;  and a 
presentation at the next destruction informals 
(April 20, 2009) including not only an oral account 
of progress, but also technical details, 
photographs and amplifying information that will 
resonate with the largely non-technical members of 
the EC.  Gheton said that he understood the problem 
and that he would communicate it to Tripoli, adding 
that Libyan technical experts would be present at 
the meeting on April 20. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Gheton then asked for U.S. support for 
Libya's request to retain the protective berm and 
sandbag wall around Rabta.  It was apparent from 
his request that Libya is still waiting for 
confirmation that the U.S. will join consensus on 
this request, which will require a change to the 
Rabta conversion plan.  Delreps stated that it 
would be necessary to check with Washington before 
providing a reply. 
 
¶4. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: 
 
-U.S. officials told Libya in 2008 (REF A) that 
approval of this request to retain the sandbag wall 
would be contingent upon Libyan fulfillment of 
several requirements, including a U.S. visit to 
Rabta.  Del requests formal guidance as to whether 
the U.S. is now in a position to support this 
request and, if not, exactly what steps must be 
taken before this will be possible. 
 
-The Secretariat has also laid out its proposed 
procedure for handling this matter.  The TS plans 
to issue a change to the conversion plan in which 
the sandbag wall will be moved from the list of 
specialized features to the list of standard 
features.  TS officials believe that this should be 
accompanied by a Libyan national paper explaining 
in detail Libya's justification for retaining this 
feature.  Del also requests guidance as to whether 
this approach is acceptable to the U.S. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Secretariat and Libyan officials have 
indicated that they are waiting for U.S. approval 
to move forward with issuing the change document. 
Please advise.
