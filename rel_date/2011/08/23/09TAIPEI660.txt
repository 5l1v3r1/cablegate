 ¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Since our last report Taiwan health 
officials have confirmed 17 cases of the H1N1 virus, 
including a case of locally contracted H1N1 virus. 
Authorities have downgraded Taiwan from a pandemic alert 
level of "Yellow 3" to "Yellow 2" since no new cases of local 
transmission have taken place.  All of the 8 new H1N1 cases 
identified since our last report (reftel) have originated 
from overseas.  H1N1 vaccine strain samples are pending 
arrival from the UK and U.S. but TCDC already has a H1N1 
vaccine strain sample from Australia. END SUMMARY. 
 
EIGHT NEW H1N1 CASES WITHIN A WEEK 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Taiwan had as of 3:00 pm June 5, seventeen 
confirmed cases of H1N1 virus. Continuing from our last 
report (reftel), case no. 10 was a Taiwan national returning 
from Guizhou, PRC via Hong Kong arriving Taiwan May 23.  He 
developed fever symptoms May 25 and sought medical care. 
Case no. 11 was a 19 year old Taiwan female returning student 
from the U.S. who returned via Boston, Chicago and Japan, 
arriving in Taipei May 27.  Case no. 12, is a 33-year old 
Taiwan male businessman who traveled from New York via Hong 
Kong to Taiwan, arriving May 27.  He did not develop fever 
symptoms upon arrival but checked into a hospital on May 30. 
Case  no. 13 is an 8-year old Canadian born Chinese girl who 
traveled from Montreal via Vancouver to Taiwan arriving May 
¶31.  She was stopped at the airport and then sent to 
quarantine.  Case no. 14, is an 8-year old Taiwan boy 
studying in Texas who returned on May 28 via LA.  Case no. 
15, is a 25-year old Taiwan male returning student from New 
York arrived via Hong Kong on May 29.  He developed fever on 
June 2.  Case no. 16 a 24 year old Taiwan male returning from 
New York via Hong Kong arrived June 1.  He developed symptoms 
during the flight.  Case no. 17, a 4-year old Taiwan child 
resident in the Philippines arrived from Manila on May 30 and 
developed a fever. 
 
MORE H1N1 FROM THE PHILIPPINES 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Of the seventeen confirmed H1N1 cases, five still 
remain in hospital. The latest cases coming from the 
Philippines indicate that local spread of the H1N1 virus may 
already be widespread there.  The Philippines has been 
upgraded to a yellow category 3 country, indicating local 
contagion of H1N1. 
 
TAIWAN READY TO PRODUCE VACCINE 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Taiwan is in process of obtaining H1N1 vaccine 
strain samples from the  UK and U.S. It has already obtained 
a vaccine strain sample from Australia and may start 
manufacturing the vaccine once the other samples arrive and 
are evaluated.  The authorities have started an open bid 
process for procurement of H1N1 vaccines.
