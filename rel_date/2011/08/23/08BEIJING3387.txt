Fukuda Resignation 
------------------ 
 
¶2. At the September 2 regular MFA press conference, spokesperson 
Jiang Yu said that the recent resignation of Japanese Prime Minister 
Yasuo Fukuda was the internal affair of Japan.  However, Jiang noted 
that Fukuda has made "great contributions" to bilateral relations 
and that China "thinks highly" of Fukuda.  China is willing to work 
together with Japan toward the "long term, sound and stable 
development" of relations. 
 
India and Nuclear Suppliers Group 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. Asked to comment on a September 1 editorial in the People's Daily 
by professor Fan Jishe critical of a U.S. proposal regarding India 
at the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) meeting, Jiang said she had not 
seen the article.  Jiang said that China "hopes the NSG will find a 
way to strike a balance between nuclear non-proliferation and 
peaceful use of nuclear energy."  In response to a separate question 
regarding the U.S. proposal, Jiang said that China "always takes a 
positive view of the NSG" and that "all countries have the right to 
the peaceful use of nuclear energy." 
 
China's Recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. In response to questions about the Russia-Georgia conflict and 
the possibility of China's recognizing the independence of South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia, Jiang said only that "China hopes the relevant 
parties will continue their efforts through dialogue and 
consultation to ease the situation and find a proper resolution for 
regional peace and stability." 
 
DPRK and Burma Food Aid 
----------------------- 
 
¶5. Jiang said she had "no specific information" and the issue was 
"out of [the MFA's] hands" regarding unspecified accusations that 
China has refused to grant export licenses for food aid for North 
Korea or Burma.  China "attaches great importance to food 
production" and "has played a positive role in world food security." 
 Jiang noted that China and North Korea have a "traditional" 
friendship. 
 
Bank of China 
------------- 
 
¶6. Responding to a question about a lawsuit filed by Israeli 
citizens against the Bank of China for allegedly transfering money 
to terrorist groups, Jiang said that the Bank of China always 
follows the laws of the places where the bank and its overseas 
branches are located and that this case has never been investigated 
by anti-money laundering authorities in China or the United States.

rescue the engineers and ensure their safety.
