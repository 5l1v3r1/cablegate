1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) and 
Commercial Assistant Sandy Lai attempted to conduct a pre-license 
check (PLC) at Unique Electronics Limited, Unit I, 3/F, Good Harvest 
Center, 33 On Chuen St., Fanling, Hong Kong (Unique).  The items in 
question are 20 Uni-Imps high-speed transient surge protectors 
classified under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 3A228 
and controlled for nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons. The 
license applicant is High Energy Devices LLC of Maryland Heights, 
MO. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong companies registry, Unique has been 
in existence since June 2003. Its directors are Song, Fang and Song, 
Youjun, both mainland Chinese passport holders.  The companyQs 
issued and paid up capital is HK10 (approximately USD 1).  According 
to the companies registry, these directors are not listed as 
directors in any other Hong Kong companies. 
 
¶4.  A review of open source information reveals that several other 
companies are collocated with Unique at its address in Hong Kong 
including the following:  Easy (H.K.) Trading Company Ltd. 
(www.easyhk.com), Prosperity International Trading Ltd., HK 
Perfection Industry Ltd., Parkson Pack Co. Ltd., and Yakoda (H.K.) 
Co., Ltd. 
 
¶5.  A review of the web site of the ultimate consignee (Xian 
Fangyanming Science & Technology) reveals that this entity has 
several affiliates.  More information on those affiliates may be 
found at the following websites: www.fy-ic.com, www.fyming.com, 
www.gatherstar.com, www.winner-fy.com and www.bjfy-ic.com.  Note 
that two affiliates are representative offices in Russia and 
Ukraine.  Shenzhen-based affiliate, Shenzhen Fan Yan Ming Technology 
Development Company states on its website that it is the authorized 
sales agent of Rochester Electronics, the worldQs most comprehensive 
aftermarket supplier of discontinued semiconductors.  Shenzhen Fan 
Yan Ming Technology Development Company further states that it can 
procure Russian military products.  The director of that company 
also appears to be a director of Unique. 
 
¶6.  Commercial Assistant Sandy Lai attempted for several weeks to 
arrange a meeting to conduct the PLC.  According to the receptionist 
who answered the phone, Mr. Sang Fong was not available to meet 
because of his travels throughout mainland China. Mr. Sang FongQs 
unwillingness to meet persisted despite numerous calls and letters 
to the company. 
 
¶7.  OEA has indicated to the ECO that the exporter no longer wishes 
to proceed with this transaction and has requested that the ECO 
close out this PLC. The ECO is therefore closing out this PLC as 
inconclusive.
