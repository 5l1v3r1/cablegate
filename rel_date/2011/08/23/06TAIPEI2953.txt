¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  A U.S. fisheries delegation visited Taiwan 
August 9 to discuss Taiwan fishing fleet overcapacity, 
ship-boarding policy in the Western and Central Pacific 
Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and Taiwan membership in 
fisheries organizations.  The U.S. called on Taiwan to reduce 
its fishing fleet capacity in WCPFC waters by at least eight 
boats and offered to have U.S. industry purchase some of the 
boats. Taiwan will review the proposal and reply at a later 
date.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) OES/OMC Director William Gibbons-Fly led 
a team composed of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency 
(NOAA) International Affairs Director Rebecca Lent, NOAA 
Pacific Islands Regional Administrator William Robinson, 
United States Tuna Foundation representative David Burney and 
Bumblebee Seafood President Chris Lischewski to Taiwan August 
9 to meet with Taiwan's Fisheries Agency and the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
 
TAIWAN IN VIOLATION OF WCPFC CAPACITY RESOLUTION 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) OES/OMC Director Gibbons-Fly noted that the 
TECRO/AIT MOU on fisheries has worked well so far, but 
expressed concern that Taiwan had still not fulfilled its 
obligations under the 1999 WCPFC resolution requiring a 
reduction in fishing capacity by Taiwan.  He said Taiwan had 
23 vessels (purse seiner type) in excess of the limit that 
continued to fish in WCPFC waters.  He said this situation 
would make it difficult for the U.S. to support Taiwan 
membership (or observership) in newly established fishery 
organizations.  Taiwan Fishery Agency Director Shieh Dah-wen 
disputed the finding that Taiwan was over the limit.  He 
claimed that six of the 23 vessels identified by WCPFC had 
been built before 1999 and so any limit would only apply to 
the remaining 18 vessels.  Shieh reported the results from 
Taiwan's latest round of fisheries talks with Japan.  He said 
Japan had concluded that because Taiwan had 
reduced its long liner fleet by 10 vessels, and another 
eight licenses had been cancelled, Taiwan was not in 
violation of the WCPFC resolution.  Gibbons-Fly replied 
that the vessels listed as having their licenses revoked were 
still operating under PRC ownership and thus did not 
contribute to reducing capacity.  He added that the 10 
long-liners were different from purse seiners and could not 
be mixed into the count. 
 
US INDUSTRY WILL BUY USED BOATS TO HELP TAIWAN 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  To help Taiwan reduce its capacity and 
enhance U.S. capacity in the WCPFC area, Gibbons-Fly 
proposed that U.S. industry could consider purchasing some 
of the vessels in Taiwan's fleet.  However, Taiwan noted 
that according to its regulations, the buying party has 
to either report a boat sunk or scrapped before Taiwan can 
sell a boat to them.  Taiwan was also concerned that given 
the recent ICCAT sanctions, it might be criticized for 
selling additional vessels to the U.S. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Taiwan fisheries agency Director Shieh Dah-wen 
promised to review the offer and consult with his industry. 
He said he supported efforts to reduce capacity, but 
shipbuilders were unhappy about their current inability to 
build new ships.  U.S. tuna interests, represented by 
Bumblebee tuna, said they wished to buy new boats but were 
willing to compromise to help Taiwan meet its requirements 
under the WCPFC. 
 
BOARDING LANGUAGE/INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) In a separate meeting with MOFA International 
Organizations Director John Chen said the language used in 
the ship-boarding procedures by the WCPFC singled out Taiwan 
for special treatment and this was not acceptable. 
Gibbons-Fly agreed that members of WCPFC should be

treated equally.  Chen then mentioned that Taiwan sought to 
become an observer in the Commission for the Conservation 
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCMLAR) and had 
submitted an application last year.  Taiwan received a 
reply that the timing was not right.  This year Taiwan 
again submitted a request but fears the PRC will veto the 
application.   Similarly, Taiwan wished to pursue 
membership in the South Pacific Regional Fisheries 
Management Organization (SPRFMO) and hoped for U.S. 
support.  Gibbons-Fly said U.S. support would be contingent 
on Taiwan's demonstrated willingness to 
abide by the rules and reduce excess fishing capacity. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. SBU)  Taiwan Fisheries Agency apparently believes it has 
fulfilled its obligation to reduce its fishing fleet capacity 
in WCPFC waters.  AIT/T will encourage Taiwan officials to 
seriously consider the proposal for the U.S. tuna industry to 
purchase up to eight purse seiners.  END COMMENT.
