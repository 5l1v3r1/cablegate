GDP growth which, however, will slow in 2008 due to effects of U.S. 
sub-prime mortgage situation and higher import costs....Taiwan 
authorities set ambitious economic development goals for 2008 and 
increased rent subsidy funding for investment projects....The 2008 
central budget was enacted before the legal deadline of December 
31....Taiwan's central bank raised interest rates to fight 
inflation....Second direct cross-Strait charter flight was launched 
one and a half year after the first one....The National 
Communications Commission Organization Law was amended to comply 
with Taiwan's Constitution....Legislation authorizes taking 
foreigners' bio-data at the time of entry....Insurance firms' 
overseas investment limit raised....Restrictions on foreign mutual 
funds relaxed....Walden International of the U.S. and JSR of Japan 
will increase investment in Taiwan....TECO becomes first to go into 
software OEM....END SUMMARY. 
 
Performance Better Than Expected 
-------------------------------- 
¶2.  (U) Unexpectedly strong economic performance in the second half 
of 2007 has prompted both domestic and foreign forecasters to raise 
Taiwan's 2007 real GDP growth estimates to 5.2-5.5%, up from the 
below 4.5% rate predicted three-six months earlier.  Year-on-year 
export growth increased from 7.6% in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 
14.4% in October-November.  Meanwhile, growth in export orders rose 
from 9.6% to 17.6%, and growth in manufacturing production 
accelerated from 0.5% to a three-and-a-half-year high of nearly 15%. 
 Unemployment was 3.87%, the second-lowest for the month of November 
over the past seven years.  Three tropical storms during 
August-October, together with higher import costs for crude oil, 
grains and dairy products, drove up Taiwan's inflation rate from nil 
early this year to 5.3% in October and 4.8% in November. 
 
Economic Growth Slows in 2008 
----------------------------- 
¶3.  (U) Most Taiwan forecasters anticipate that Taiwan's economic 
growth in 2008 will slow to below 4.5%.  They believe that the U.S. 
sub-prime mortgage problem, as well as higher international prices 
for oil and grains, will dampen world economic performance and 
reduce demand for products from the export-oriented economy of 
Taiwan.  The Taiwan Research Institute (TRI) predicted that real 
export growth in 2008 will drop to 3.96% from an estimated 7.2% in 
2007, and the Academia Sinica expected the growth rate will decline 
to just above 3%. 
 
Official Goals for 2008 
----------------------- 
¶4.  (U) Despite slow growth prospects for next year, Taiwan 
authorities still set optimistic economic development goals for 
2008: economic growth at 4.8%, unemployment below 3.8%, and 
inflation less than 2%.  Per capita GDP will increase from 2007's 
estimated US$16,768 to US$18,000.  To achieve these goals, the 
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) set a 7.3% growth target for 
private manufacturing investment, mainly in information technology 
(IT) and electronics.  The MOEA will increase rent subsidies for 
investment projects in industrial parks.  Meanwhile, the Council of 
Labor Affairs will increase the monthly subsidy for employment of a 
jobless worker from NT$5,000 to NT$10,000 (US$307), effective 
January 1, 2008.  The length of the subsidy will be 12 months. 
 
2008 Private Investment Target: NT$1.08 Trillion 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
¶5.  (U) The MOEA will raise its private manufacturing investment 
target to NT$1.08 trillion (US$32.8 billion), up 7.3% from the 2007 
target of NT$1.006 trillion.  According to the MOEA's projection, 
 
TAIPEI 00000007  002 OF 004 
 
 
investment in metals and electronic tools will enjoy the highest 
growth in 2008, while IT and electronics will contribute 51% of 2008 
private investment, including NT$220 billion (US$6.77 billion) in 
flat panels.  Chi Mei Optoelectronics will start building an 8th 
generation plant, and AUO will launch a 7.5 generation plant 
project.  A target of NT$260 billion (US$8 billion) is set for the 
semiconductor industry, mainly new 12-inch fabs, including one to be 
built by Chunghwa Picture Tubes in central Taiwan.  A target of 
NT$296.9 billion (US$ 9.1 billion) has been set for the metals and 
electronic tools industry, up 23% over the 2007 target, mainly due 
to strong demand for tool machinery. 
 
Subsidy for Investment in Industrial Parks 
------------------------------------------ 
¶6.  (U) The MOEA will increase its rent subsidy funding for 
investment projects in industrial parks.  The program, nicknamed the 
"006688 Program" (i.e., rent free for the first two years, 40% 
discount for the next two years, and 20% discount for the fifth and 
sixth years), has attracted many investors, including overseas 
Taiwan firms.  With funding of NT$110 billion (US$3.38 billion), the 
program has attracted 851 companies to rent 590 hectares of land in 
industrial parks, which has generated NT$355 billion (US$10.95 
billion) in investment and created 65,000 jobs.  The MOEA will add 
NT$20 billion (US$615.5 million) to the program.  Companies 
currently considering using the 006688 Program include Fujitsu, 
which is planning an upcoming WiMAX project, and a Taiwan 
optoelectronics firm. 
 
2008 Central Budget Enacted before Legal Deadline 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶7.  (U) Taiwan's Legislative Yuan (LY) passed the 2008 central 
budget in late December, for the first time in eight years complying 
with the law to enact the budget bill before the end of a year.  The 
LY cut proposed expenditure by 0.8% to NT$ 1,686 billion (US$51.9 
billion), and the 0.8% cut was the smallest in past ten years.  The 
LY also approved the budget for military procurement projects, 
including four sets of Patriot III missiles and funding to assess 
submarine procurement.  The six sets of Patriot III missiles require 
funding of NT$21.9 billion (US$673.8 million).  Funding to assess 
submarine procurement is NT$2 billion (US$61.5 million).  Funding 
for P3C anti-submarine aircraft is NT$1.7 billion (US$52.3 
million). 
 
CBT Raised Interest Rates to Fight Inflation 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶8.  (U) The Central Bank of ROC (Taiwan) raised its benchmark rates 
by 0.125 percentage points in an effort to fight inflation, which 
rose in the second half of this year.  The MOEA helped fight 
inflation by freezing gasoline prices, although the cumulative 
increase in crude oil import costs in November crossed the 12% 
threshold for the upward adjustment of gasoline prices.  During 
August-October, three tropical storms pushed up produce prices by 
50-100%, with some vegetable prices even tripling.  Produce prices 
declined to normal levels in late November.  Crude oil import costs, 
however, rose to over US$90 per barrel, and grain import prices were 
increasing steadily.  Consequently, Taiwan's inflation rate measured 
by the consumer price index rose from almost nil in early 2007 to 
5.3% in October and 4.8% in November. 
 
Second Direct Cross-Strait Cargo Flight 
--------------------------------------- 
¶9.  (U) State-owned China Airlines (CAL) launched a second round of 
direct cross-Strait cargo flights on December 12.  Contracted by 
ProMOS Technologies of Taiwan, CAL transported eight-inch silicon 
wafer manufacturing equipment to Chongqing, China.  The first direct 
cross-Strait cargo flights took place in July 2006. 
 
 
TAIPEI 00000007  003 OF 004 
 
 
NCC Organization Amended to Comply with Constitution 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶10.  (U) The LY completed the third and final reading of amendments 
to the National Communications Commission (NCC) Organization Law in 
late December.  According to the legislation, NCC Commissioners 
shall be nominated by the Premier and approved by the Legislative 
Yuan.  The number of NCC commissioners will be reduced to seven from 
13, and a single political party may not hold over half of the total 
Commissioner seats.  All NCC members have tendered their 
resignations effective January 1, 2008.  Late last year, the Supreme 
Court handed down a judgment that the method for selecting 
commissioners is unconstitutional and that the current NCC shall 
cease to function in January 2008.  Before amendment, the National 
Communications Commission Organization Law prescribed that NCC 
members shall be proportionally allocated to political parties based 
on the number of seats in the LY. 
 
Anti-terrorism Legislation 
-------------------------- 
¶11.  (U) The LY passed the third and final reading of a bill to 
amend the Immigration Law.  The legislation authorized Taiwan's 
Immigration Administration to take bio-data (including fingerprints) 
of foreigners at the time of entry.  A bio-data identification 
system will be implemented in 2009.  The legislation will permit 
victims of domestic abuse to continue staying in Taiwan after the 
court issues a protection order.  The amended law will prohibit 
cross-border marriage brokerage. 
 
Insurance Firms' Overseas Investment Limit Raised 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶12.  (U) The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) raised the limit 
on an insurance company's offshore investment from 35% to 45% of 
total insurance funds if the company's paid-in capital exceeds 300% 
of the risk-based assets.  The FSC also removed a ban on offshore 
real estate investment by insurance firms which, however, is subject 
to a cap of 10% of net worth.  The liberalization measures will 
increase Taiwan insurance sector's offshore investment by an 
estimated NT$700 billion (US$21.5 billion) and, therefore, drive up 
Taiwan's long-term interest rates. 
 
Restrictions on Foreign Mutual Funds 
------------------------------------ 
¶13.  (U) The FSC relaxed restrictions on foreign mutual funds in 
Taiwan.  The ceiling limit on financial derivatives held by a 
foreign mutual fund was raised from 15% of net worth to 40%.  The 
FSC also removed a ban on foreign mutual funds trading in financial 
derivatives.  With the relaxations, many additional foreign mutual 
funds may be sold in Taiwan. 
 
Walden International to Increase Taiwan Investment 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
¶14.  (U) During its 20th anniversary ceremony, Walden International, 
a venture capital firm based in San Francisco, announced that it 
will increase its investment in Taiwan's biotech and high-tech 
industries by NT$10 billion (US$308 million).  Walden, which 
operates a capital fund worth nearly US$2 billion, has been active 
in Asian markets.  Walden currently provides capital funding to 
several prominent Taiwan semiconductor companies (including 
Powerchip Semiconductor and TICP) and IT manufacturers such as 
ZyXel, E-Ten, and Hitron Technologies.  Walden, one of Taiwan's 
venture capital pioneers, formed its subsidiary in Taiwan in 1987. 
 
JSR's Expansion Project 
----------------------- 
¶15.  (U) JSR of Japan, the world's largest producer of color resists 
for TFT-LCD screens, announced it will increase its investment in 
the Central Taiwan Science Park (CTSP).  It will add production 
 
TAIPEI 00000007  004 OF 004 
 
 
lines for semiconductor and optoelectronics materials.  JSR invested 
nearly NT$800 million (US$24.6 million) in 2006 to set up JSR Micro, 
the company's Taiwan subsidiary located at CTSP, to supply photo 
spacers, protective film and alignment film to Taiwan's major flat 
panel makers, including AUO, Chi Mei Optoelectronics, Hannstar, and 
Chunghwa Picture Tubes.  During the first stage of its factory 
launch, JSR Micro focused mainly on the production of color resists, 
where it holds 60% of the Taiwan market.  Its presence in Taiwan has 
given such companies as AUO and Chi Mei quick access to materials, 
allowing them to enjoy a competitive edge in the world market. 
 
First Software OEM in Taiwan 
---------------------------- 
¶16.  (U) TECO Group, a Taiwanese multinational business 
conglomerate, will enter an OEM software joint venture with Intec 
Group, Japan's second-largest IT services provider, and Nihon 
Technos, a major human resources company in Japan.  Recently, TECO 
signed an agreement with these two Japanese firms to form Dongyingte 
International, which will become the first OEM software provider for 
Japanese companies.  The initial investment will be NT$56 million 
(US$1.7 million).  TECO will contribute 60% of the capital, while 
Intec Group and Nihon Technos each hold a 20% stake.  The joint 
venture is expected to bring in earnings of NT$30 million (US$0.9 
million) from the Japanese software OEM market during its first 
year, and achieve yearly revenues of NT$100 million (US$3 million) 
over the next four years.  The joint venture will focus on software 
applications for finance, banking, public institutions, medical 
care, and CRM (Customer Relationship Management).
