SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: JUNE 2008 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. In June 2008, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of 17 Embassy registered property claims, including one 
under the control of the Ministry of Education. With the inclusion 
of these 17 claims resolved in June, the GON has so far resolved 38 
claims during the 2007-2008 waiver year.  The Property Office 
database now includes 630 unresolved registered property claims 
belonging to 301 Amcits.  To date, most resolutions have involved 
compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de 
pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of June 30, 2008, the GON has 
issued BPIs with a face value of $327,321,987 to Embassy-registered 
claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, the Ortega 
administration has resolved a total of 43 claims, 38 during this 
waiver year.  The GON also resolved one U.S. citizen non-waiver 
claim.
