SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION 
------------------------ 
 
¶1. In January of the 2007-2008 waiver year, the Government of 
Nicaragua dismissed 52 U.S. citizen claims via a dubious review 
process that determined claimants did not own the property that had 
been expropriated. The Embassy does not consider these 52 claims 
resolved and they remain active in our database.  A U.S. citizen 
claimant also withdrew six property claims after a local court 
foreclosed upon the properties.  The legal representative for the 
heirs of a deceased American citizen claimant informed us that the 
GON resolved a claim registered in the Embassy's Property Office 
database.  We have added a "Court Decision Against Claimant (Claim 
Withdrawn by Amcit)" section and a "Claims Dismissed by the GON" 
section to this report. 
 
¶2. Since January 1995, the GON has resolved 2,520 Embassy-registered property claims belonging to 658 American citizens (Amcits). With the resolution of one Embassy-registered claim and the withdrawal of six Embassy-registered claims, the Property Office database now includes 667 registered property claims belonging to 294 Amcits. Including Amcit claims not registered with the Embassy, the GON has resolved a total of 4,540 American citizen claims since January 1995. Most have involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs). As of January 31, 2007, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of $324,000,525 to Embassy-registered claimants. With the inclusion of the one claim compensated in January, the GON has resolved six cases during this waiver year.
 
EMBASSY REGISTERED CLAIMS DISMISSED BY GON 
------------------------------------------ 

¶3. On November 29, 2007, the GON presented the Property Office a list of 18 Embassy-registered claims it was considering dismissing primarily because of the lack of proof that the claimant owned property that had been expropriated (Ref A). On January 31, 2008, the GON reported that the 18 claims provided in November 2007 are indeed "dismissed" cases, and in addition provided a second list of 34 Embassy-registered "dismissed" claims so characterized because a) the claimant could not provide proof of ownership and/or expropriation of the property; b) the claimant already possessed the property (but still needed the title); or, c) the matter is being handled in court. Property Superintendent Yara Perez explained that claimants must either follow the administrative process or pursue the claim in court (Ref B).
 
¶4. It appears that the GON's currently preferred method to "resolve" 
Embassy-registered claims is "dismissal."  The Embassy does not 
recognize these dismissed claims as resolved at this time, and 
continues its efforts to contact and consult with affected claimants 
to ensure that their rights are protected.  Our Property Office also 
continues to press the GON for more cooperation on the resolution of 
property claims in a fair and transparent manner. 
 
EMBASSY REGISTERED CLAIMS WITHDRAWN BASED ON COURT DECISIONS
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5. On January 30, 2008, Mr. Jose Arguello asked the Property Office 
to remove six Embassy-registered claims from our database after a 
local court ruled that the properties be foreclosed upon and 
transferred to a private bank.  Mr. Arguello has accepted the court 
decision and said that he will no longer pursue these claims.

¶6. On February 6, 2008, Dr. Lino Meza Martinez, legal representative 
for the heirs of Mrs. Teodolinda Gonzalez-Becklin, provided a 
written statement to the Embassy Property Office attesting that on 
January 15, 2008, the GON had compensated Gonzalez-Becklin with 
indemnification bonds (BPIs) for a house in Managua.  The heirs of 
Mrs. Gonzalez-Becklin reached a settlement with the GON for BPIs 
with a face value of 1,035,600 cordobas, approximately $24,750.  We 
have updated our database to reflect this settlement.
