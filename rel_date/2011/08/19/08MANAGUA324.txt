¶1. (SBU) Summary: Post requests that nonimmigrant visa eligibility 
be restored for Porfirio Molina Palacios.  Post has confirmed that 
Molina satisfactorily resolved his property dispute with the heir of 
U.S. claimant Mr. Jose Moncada on November 29, 2005.  Please see 
action request in Paragraph 3.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 29, 2005, Mr. Jamil Moncada, son and heir of U.S. claimant Mr. Jose Moncada, settled his family's property dispute with Porfirio Molina by accepting another piece of property along with indemnification bonds issued by the Government of Nicaragua (GON) worth an estimated $112,260. On December 22, 2005, the Embassy received a copy of the settlement document from the GON.
 
On March 13, 2008, Econoff spoke to Mr. Jamil Moncada who confirmed that his family's claim had been settled. Mr. Moncada lives in Nicaragua and may be contacted by telephone at the following number: (505) 782-6419.
 
¶3. (SBU) Action Request: Post finds sufficient evidence that the 
property dispute between Jose Moncada and Porfirio Molina Palacios 
has been resolved.  Thus, we request the Department consider 
removing his visa ineligibility under Section 2225.
