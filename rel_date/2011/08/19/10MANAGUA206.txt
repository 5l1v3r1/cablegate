SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Nicaraguan Tourism Institute (INTUR), an agency of the 
Government of Nicaragua, reported that the tourism industry grew 
8.3 percent in 2009 versus 2008.  INTUR stated the reasons for the 
sector's growth were the removal of visa requirements for Costa 
Rica and an emphasis on attracting tourists as a region.  Some 
industry experts believe that INTUR's data, however, may not be 
accurate because they do not distinguish among family visits, 
business travel, missionary groups, and leisure travel.  The 
tourism industry is optimistic that 2010 will be better than 2009 
because the global economy appears to be recovering. 
 
 
 
STATISTICS SHOW GROWTH - BUT EXPERTS SKEPTICAL 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 4, INTUR provided the Embassy its 2009 report 
on the tourism industry.  INTUR reported that tourism grew by 8.3 
in 2009 versus 2008.  The government counted 929,157 foreign 
visitors to Nicaragua in 2009 (including family visits, business 
travel, and leisure).  INTUR reported $301.7 million in revenues 
for the tourism sector, up from $246 million in 2008.  The report 
stated the reasons for the sector's growth in 2009 were the removal 
of visa requirements for Costa Rica and coordinated efforts by 
Central American countries to attract tourists as a region. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Raul Calvet, president of a tourism services company, 
noted that INTUR data are poorly prepared and do not distinguish 
between family visits, business travel, and leisure travel 
(tourism).  He added that INTUR's failure to disaggregate these 
types of visitors makes it difficult to identify industry trends. 
For example, experts suggest that business travel declined in 2009; 
the managers of three major hotels in Managua report that hotel 
occupancy rates across the city were lower compared to 2008. 
 
 
 
TOURISM INDUSTRY: 2009 PROVIDED A RAY OF HOPE 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Despite some skepticism concerning INTUR's statistical 
data, leisure travel appears to have increased.  The National 
Chamber of Tourism (CANATUR) reported that small and medium 
businesses involved in the tourism sector saw a 6 percent increase 
in tourist visits in 2009.  The Nicaraguan Association of Small 
Hotels issued a press release stating that sales for its members 
improved by 20% during the last three months in 2009 versus the 
same period in 2008.  CANATUR added, however, that overall revenues 
for these companies are down by over 10 percent when compared to 
2008 because many tourists looked for bargains and were not willing 
to spend as much money as they did in previous years.  A majority 
of leisure travelers are also staying in smaller, inexpensive 
hotels for vacations of 5-7 days, instead of 10-14 day vacations, 
to save money. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Alfredo Gutierrez, former president of the Nicaraguan 
Association of Tourism Operators (ANTUR) and owner of a small 
tourism company, said that he and others in the tourism industry 
have lowered their prices to attract customers, and these 
adjustments have helped to maintain their businesses.  In Granada 
and San Juan del Sur -- the most popular tourist destinations in 
Nicaragua -- hotels, bars, and restaurants reported that their 
sales were better in 2009 versus 2008.  The bigger and more 
expensive hotels and resorts attracted slightly more customers in 
2009 compared to 2008.  Despite the improvement in the number of 
tourists who visited Nicaragua in 2009, many tourism-related 
businesses have had to either reduce their operating expenses or 
dismiss staff in order to stay afloat. 
 
OPTIMISM FOR 2010 
 
----------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Industry representatives are optimistic that 2010 will be 
better than 2009.  Hotel owners in Granada and San Juan del Sur 
reported that occupancy rates in January were higher than the same 
period in 2009.  Entrepreneurs are encouraged that the global 
economy appears to be recovering, particularly in the United 
States, as U.S. citizens by far comprise the largest number of 
tourists who vacation or visit Nicaragua.  They also report that 
the government has developed plans to improve electricity, water 
supplies, and address the crucial need for better roads.  They are 
concerned, however, about the increase in crime in 2009 and its 
implications for the industry.
