SUBJECT: ADVISORY OPINION REQUEST 
 
REF: MANAGUA 625 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Robert J. Callahan for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d 
). 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Post requests Department concurrence in a finding 
of INA Sec. 212(a)(2)(I) inadmissibility for Armando Jose 
Garcia Campos (26-OCT-1950, NIC), and requests approval to 
revoke subject's valid B1/B2 visa, on the basis that he is 
inadmissible to the United States for engaging in money 
laundering. 
 
¶2.  (C) As reported in Reftel, Garcia was terminated as 
President of one of Nicaragua's largest microfinance 
institutions (ACODEP--financed by numerous U.S. NGOs along 
with OPIC funds) in 2008 by its board of directors after an 
internal audit revealed that Garcia had embezzled thousands 
of dollars during the previous few years.  The ACODEP board 
initially attempted to negotiate a graceful exit for Garcia, 
but when they discovered additional evidence of more serious 
embezzlement, negotiations broke down and Garcia was relieved 
of his position. 
 
¶3.  (C) In response, in February 2009, Garcia exploited his 
Nicaraguan political contacts to have himself "reinstated" as 
president of ACODEP on dubious legal grounds for a period of 
two months, during which he orchestrated the embezzlement of 
between $3 and $5 million dollars, essentially liquidating 
ACODEP's bank accounts and leading to large losses for its 
U.S. investors.  One scheme Garcia favored was to "employ" 
outside contractors for ACODEP, subsequently pressuring them 
to cash checks at one of Nicaragua's largest banks, 
BANCENTRO, for exorbitant amounts of money, such as $250,000 
for three weeks of work in "wages," which Garcia then 
partially pocketed.  Post has obtained credible documentary 
evidence from ACODEP's current board--corroborated by U.S. 
investors--which directly indicts Garcia. 
 
¶4.  (C) Beyond the well-documented embezzlement schemes, 
Garcia has twice attempted to retake Managua's ACODEP 
headquarters using armed security personnel, on February 27 
and most recently on September 4.  During the September 4 
incident, Garcia held over 50 ACODEP employees and customers 
hostage for over two hours.  Garcia's son accompanied him 
with a handgun and physically threatened ACODEP employees. 
The September 4 incident was broadcast live on one of 
Nicaragua's major television news channels.  The Nicaraguan 
National Police are currently investigating Garcia for 
robbery, property theft and possible kidnapping.  ACODEP's 
U.S. investors regard Garcia as a dangerous, violent and 
unpredictable individual out for revenge. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Based on the available evidence of Garcia's direct 
involvement in the embezzlement of $3-5 million, resulting in 
substantial losses to U.S. investors, including the 
USG-affiliated Overseas Private Investment Corporation 
(OPIC), post requests that the Department find Armando Jose 
Garcia Campos inadmissible to the United States under INA 
Sec. 212(a)(2)(I) and authorize the revocation of his valid 
B1/B2 visa under this statute.
