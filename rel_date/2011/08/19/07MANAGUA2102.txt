¶1. (SBU/NF) SUMMARY.  Following the re-activation of the 
Samuel Roberts' two SH-60 helicopters on September 10, a 
total of 19 sorties have been carried out, delivering relief 
supplies, medical supplies, doctors, and security personnel 
to nine outlining communities in the Northern Atlantic 
Autonomous Region (RAAN).  On September 12, Overseas Private 
Investment Corp (OPIC) executive Robert Mossbacher, in an 
event covered by all national media, signed a memo of intent, 
extending an additional USD 7 million to rebuild homes in the 
affected areas.  Over the past two days, Spanish and 
Venezuelan air support has delivered nearly 70 tons of relief 
supplies from Managua to Puerto Cabezas.  A Dutch ship 
containing some 200 tons of relief supplies arrived in Puerto 
Cabezas on September 11.  U.S. military assets are expected 
to continue operations for the next several days, primarily 
in Puerto Cabezas.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CURRENT SITUATION 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2. (U) AFFECTED PERSONS: As of Monday evening, September 10, 
the GON was reporting the following data regarding the human 
impact of Hurricane Felix.  Affected persons: 162,373 in the 
municipalities of Puerto Cabezas, Waspam, Rosita, Bonanza, 
and Alamikamba in the RAAN and in the departments of Nueva 
Segovia and Jinotega; 136 people have been rescued. 
CASUALTIES: 67 confirmed dead of which 65 were registered in 
the communities of Puerto Cabezas and 2 in Asan; 76 
unconfirmed deaths; and 110 persons are missing.  PROPERTY 
DAMAGE: 16,633 houses damaged (9,864 destroyed and 6,769 
without roofs); 153 buildings and 12,072 latrines sustained 
partial damage.  WELLS POLLUTED: 9,010. 
 
¶3. (U) RETURN OF DOD ASSETS: Since sitrep 5, US SOUTHCOM 
re-activated two SH-60 helicopters to distribute relief 
supplies from Puerto Cabezas to outlying communities in the 
region.  The SH-60s carried out nine and ten sorties on 
September 11 and 12, respectively. 
 
¶4.  (SBU/NF) SINAPRED UNCOOPERATIVE:  OFDA/Milgroup team in 
Puerto Cabezas was denied access to the SINAPRED planning 
meeting on September 11.  On September 12, Ambassador raised 
the issue with Foreign Minister Santos, who, within minutes, 
called back to report that President Ortega had given an 
order to allow OFDA/Milgroup to participate all appropriate 
planning meetings.  (NOTE:  SINAPRED postponed the regularly 
scheduled evening planning meeting for September 12.  It is 
unlikely the meeting will be rescheduled for September 12. 
END NOTE) 
 
¶5. (U) SUPPLY SITUATION IN MANAGUA: A snapshot assessment showed no backlog of supplies in Managua. However, the Nicaraguan military logistical coordinator in Managua indicated that SINAPRED has another 500 tons of supplies in a storage facility outside the airport, but was uncertain about SINAPRED's deployment plans for the supplies. He indicated that an additional C-130-equivalent aircraft is essential to guarantee the continued smooth flow of supplies to the Atlantic Coast.
 
¶6.  (U) SOUTHCOM ASSESSMENT TEAM RETURNS TOMORROW: 
SOUTHCOM's second assessment team flew to Puerto Cabezas on 
the afternoon of September 12 and will return to Managua on 
September 13.  Subsequent U.S. military asset deployment 
plans may be adjusted based on the team's assessment.

¶8. (U) On September 12, OPIC executive Robert Mossbacher 
signed a memo of intent with BANCENTRO to add USD 7 million 
to an existing USD 30 million agreement to rebuild houses in 
the hurricane affected areas.  The event was well-covered by 
all Nicaraguan national media.  In addition, the Embassy 
issued a Spanish press release highlighting the deal. 
 
¶9. (U) Following the signing, Mossbacher and the Ambassador met with President Ortega and the First Lady at the FSLN Secretariat. They discussed the OPIC deal and briefed Ortega on the status of US hurricane relief efforts, calling attention to the USD 1.4 million in disaster assistance the U.S. has delivered thus far. Separately, Embassy press officer Kristen Stewart briefed most national media about the OPIC / BANCENTRO deal and the USD 1.4 million in disaster assistance.
