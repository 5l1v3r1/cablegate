SUBJECT:  Situation Report 1: Tropical Storm Alma 
 
REF: Managua 0688 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: According to the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (INETER), Tropical Storm Alma exited Nicaragua at approximately 8:00 pm on May 29, 2008. A preliminary damage assessment in Leon, Chinandega, Managua, Carazo and Rivas departments carried out by the Nicaraguan National Disaster Agency (SINAPRED) indicates that damage to houses, particularly damage to roofs, is widespread. During the storm, over 4000 persons were evacuated. Two deaths were reported. SINAPRED and the Nicaraguan Civil Defense reported an immediate need for basic food supplies for those remaining in shelters. The majority of those evacuated in the initial response have returned to their homes. A USAID/OFDA team arrived in Managua May 30 and is en route to affected areas to carry out a more complete needs assessment. END SUMMARY
 
¶2. INETER reported that Tropical Storm Alma departed Nicaragua at 
8:00 pm on May 29.  It was downgraded to a tropical depression, with 
diminished wind and rainfall. 
 
¶3. SINAPRED information was based on reports made at 6:00 am on May 30, with more precise numbers regarding physical damage to structures throughout the affected regions. The latest information indicates that 222 houses were flooded, 460 were partially damaged and 12 houses were destroyed by either wind or water damage.
 
¶A. SINAPRED also estimates that 4,036 persons were evacuated in the 
five affected regions, 787 families in total. 
 
¶B. In addition, power lines and potable water sources were severely 
damaged, particularly in the greater Leon City area.  Telephone 
lines are also down in Leon and Chinandega due to falling trees and 
branches.  Communications to these areas remain difficult due to 
lack of land telephone lines. 
 
USG ASSISTANCE 
 
¶4. A three-person USAID/OFDA team is on the ground, en route for 
Chinandega and Leon departments to assess damage.  They will meet 
with local NGO representatives to collect more information and 
determine the most efficient response to emergency needs. 
 
¶5. USAID/OFDA approved the Ambassador's May 29 request for emergency relief funds and has just provided $50,000 to cover shelter materials such as zinc roofing sheets to affected families.
 
¶6. A press release on the U.S. donation was issued at 4 pm Managua 
time.
