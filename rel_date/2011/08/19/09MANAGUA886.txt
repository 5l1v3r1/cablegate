SUBJECT: NATIONAL DAY MESSAGE FOR NICARAGUA: ORTEGA READS LIVE ON RADIO
 
REF: SECSTATE 90253 
 
(U) The Ambassador delivered the text of the President 
Obama's National Day Message contained in REFTEL to 
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, on September 2, 2009, at 
the beginning of a previously-scheduled courtesy call between 
Ortega and General Douglas Fraser, Commander of U.S. Southern 
Command (Mtg reported SEPTEL).  Ortega thanked the Ambassador 
for the letter, then without warning opened it on the spot 
and proceeded to read it aloud.  The courtesy call was being 
carried live by Sandinista Party-affiliated radio 
broadcasters, so the National Day message was likely heard 
throughout the country.
