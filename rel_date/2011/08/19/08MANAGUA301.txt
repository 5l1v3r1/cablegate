SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. Since January 1995, the GON has resolved 2,521 Embassy-registered property claims belonging to 659 American citizens (Amcits). With the resolution of 1 Embassy-registered claim in February, the Property Office database now includes 666 registered property claims belonging to 293 Amcits. Including Amcit claims not registered with the Embassy, the GON has resolved a total of 4,541 American citizen claims since 1992. Most resolutions have involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs). As of February 29, 2008, the GON has issued BPIs with a face value of $324,042,527 to Embassy-registered claimants. With the inclusion of 1 claim compensated in February, the GON has resolved 7 claims during this waiver year.
 
EMBASSY-REGISTERED CLAIMS RESOLVED IN FEBRUARY 2008 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. On February 14, 2008, Dr. Maria Gutierrez, legal representative for U.S. citizen Noel Gonzalez, provided a written statement to the Embassy Property Office attesting that on November 14, 2007, the GON compensated Gonzalez with indemnification bonds (BPIs) for a house in Managua. Mr. Gonzalez reached a settlement with the GON for BPIs with a face value of 801,100 cordobas, approximately $42,750. We have updated our database to reflect this settlement.
