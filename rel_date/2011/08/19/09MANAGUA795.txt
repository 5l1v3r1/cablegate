¶3.  (U) BEGIN TEXT OF EMBASSY UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION 
 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
MRE/DGA-AN/0092/08/09 
OGZ/RM/JR 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Nicaragua, 
Directorate General of the Americas, greets the Honorable 
Embassy of the United States of America, on the occasion of 
referring to communication No. 280, dated December 12, 2008 
related to the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement 
(ACSA). 
 
In this sense, the Ministry informs the Honorable Embassy it 
concurs with the terms of the proposed agreement, as long as 
the following observations are considered: 
 
1 - This agreement does not constitute an International 
Treaty, but is an Inter-Institutional Agreement. 
 
2 - Revise page 3 of the Spanish translation, number 4 part 
b, the word "de" after "arriendo" is repeated. 
 
3 - It is suggested to alternate the names of the signing 
institutions and coordinate with the parties for the 
respective signatures. 
 
As previously mentioned, this Ministry informs the honorable 
Embassy that the Army of Nicaragua is ready to sign this 
aforementioned agreement, and to this end you may contact 
this Ministry or Brigadier General Adolfo Jose Zepeda 
Martinez, Chief of Public Relations and Foreign Affairs of 
the Army of Nicaragua, to discuss the details for organizing 
the signing of the document. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Directorate General of the 
Americas, avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the 
honorable Embassy of the United States of America the 
assurances of its highest consideration. 
 
Managua, August 3, 2009

END OF EMBASSY UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION 
 
¶4.  (U) ACTION REQUEST.  With this official correspondence, 
the GON has now indicated its willingness to conclude and 
sign the bilateral ACSA as presented by the USG without 
substantive changes.  We request Department provide 
instructions as to how to proceed toward concluding this 
agreement, including guidance as to who would sign for the 
USG.  We note that U.S. Southern Command's Gen. Fraser is 
expected to be in Managua in early September to attend the 
30th Anniversary of the founding of the Nicaraguan Military. 
An ACSA signing ceremony in conjunction with his projected 
visit presents an excellent opportunity to  underscore the 
continued excellent partnership between the militaries of the 
United States and of Nicaragua. 
 
¶5.  (U) Embassy POCs for this issue are:  Deputy Pol 
Counselor, Jesse Curtis (CurtisJS@state.sgov.gov) and U.S. 
Military Group Commander, LTC Michael Regan
