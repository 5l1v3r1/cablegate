¶1.  Summary: In August 2007, the first month of the 2007-2008 waiver 
year, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the resolution of 
one Embassy-registered property claim.  Since January 1995, 2,515 
Embassy-registered property claims belonging to 656 American 
citizens (Amcits) have been resolved.  There remain 678 registered 
property claims belonging to 296 Amcits.  Including Amcit claims not 
registered with the Embassy, a total of 4,535 Amcits' claims have 
been resolved since January 1995.  Most have involved compensation 
via government-issued indemnification bonds (bonos de pago de 
indemnizacion or BPIs).  As of July 31, 2007, the GON had issued 
BPIs with a face value of $321,300,000 to Embassy-registered 
claimants.  As of August 31, 2007, the face value of BPIs issued 
remains the same.  End Summary.
