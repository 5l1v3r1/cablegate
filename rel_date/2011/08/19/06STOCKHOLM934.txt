¶2.  (c) Polcouns made 6/21 reftel demarche seeking support 
for Nicaraguan presidential elections to MFA Desk Officer for 
Nicaragua Carolina Benedictsson.  Sweden supports an EU 
election observation mission, Benedictsson said, adding that 
a Swedish representative is participating in the EU's 
"exploratory" observation group that arrived in Managua June 
20 to review the election situation in Nicaragua.  In regard 
to support for funding an OAS observation mission, 
Benedictsson said she was not aware of a request for OAS 
election observation funding having been received by Sweden. 
She said Sweden had contributed to OAS election observation 
in the past, adding that the GoS would evaluate this funding 
request when received.  Action request:  can we confirm that 
a request for funding the OAS observation has been given to 
the GoS?
