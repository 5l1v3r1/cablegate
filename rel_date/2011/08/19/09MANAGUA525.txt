¶1. (U) Summary: As of May 26, 2009, Nicaragua has reported no 
confirmed cases of H1N1 Influenza.  In response to the H1N1 
epidemic, the Ministry of Health (MINSA) is implementing its 
National Plan for Prevention of and Response to Human 
Influenza Epidemic, focusing on surveillance at ports of 
entry and prevention through education.  U.S. Embassy Managua 
is assisting MINSA with USAID-funded community health 
training and rapid response team training at the municipal 
level.  On May 9 the U.S. Department of Defense's SOUTHCOM 
Humanitarian Assiatance Program (HAP) delivered 5,000 units 
of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) designed for use by 
MINSA medical personnel.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) As of May 26, 2009, Nicaragua has reported no 
confirmed cases of H1N1.  The Ministry of Health (MINSA) is 
the lead Nicaraguan agency on H1N1 preparation and response. 
MINSA has mobilized nationwide surveillance measures, an 
education campaign, and a plan to deal with the possible 
appearance of H1N1 Influenza.  MINSA reports that it has 
administered 55 rapid diagnostic tests for Influenza A, but 
none has proved positive.  MINSA is actively monitoring 49 
suspicious cases, all of which are described as "under 
control."  Minister of Health Guillermo Gonzalez has 
recognized publicly that it is only a matter of time before 
H1N1 reaches Nicaragua. 
 
Surveillance and Prevention 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) In response to the H1N1 epidemic, the Ministry of 
Health (MINSA) is implementing its National Plan for 
Prevention of and Response to Human Influenza Epidemic.  The 
plan focuses on surveillance at all ports of entry and 
prevention through education.  At ports of entry, most 
particularly Managua's Sandino International Airport, health 
personnel closely screen passengers entering the country for 
flu symptoms and distribute information pamphlets.  Before 
disembarking in Managua, all airline passengers complete 
forms describing medical symptoms, which authorities review 
as passengers pass through immigration control.  Health 
officials use infrared imagers to screen airline passengers 
for high body temperature.  On May 20, 2009, in fact, a 
passenger arriving from Miami was interviewed by health 
officials and transferred to a local hospital for observation 
and testing after infrared images revealed he had a fever. 
Test results proved negative for H1N1 Influenza. 
 
¶4. (U) Surveillance for H1N1 among the general population is 
nationwide, but is most robust in Managua.  MINSA has mounted 
a major education campaign designed to prevent the 
transmission of influenza.  The Government of Nicaragua has 
designated local Citizen Power Councils, or CPC's, as the 
primary point of contact for the Nicaraguan people (Ref C). 
Nicaraguans with influenza are advised to remain at home and 
to contact their local CPC to arrange for a home medical 
visit by MINSA staff for testing and possible treatment. 
While politically motivated and controlled, there is no 
evidence at this time that the CPC's are applying partisan 
criteria to the provision of medical services related to 
H1N1.  MINSA's influenza epidemic plan also calls for the 
mobilization of 35,000 health volunteers (brigadistas) to 
lead community-level activities nationwide. 
 
USAID Playing a Positive Role 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) A USAID-funded community health project called 
FamiSalud, working in 70 of Nicaragua's poorest 
municipalities, is assisting MINSA to educate the public on 
H1N1.  FamiSalud trains volunteers, conducts community 
meetings, and distributes written material on H1N1. 
FamiSalud has also briefed members of the Nicaraguan private 
sector.  USAID also assists MINSA with rapid response team 
training at the municipal level and with the development of 
municipal response plans for pandemic influenza. 
 
Testing and Medical Supplies 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) The Ministry of Health's national laboratory recently obtained the reagents necessary to test specifically for the H1N1 virus and continues to send samples to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta for confirmation. Authorities report they have stockpiled 73,000 courses of antiviral medication to treat an H1N1 outbreak -- enough treatments to cover about 1% of the population.
 
¶7. (U) On May 9 the U.S. Department of Defense's (DOD) 
SOUTHCOM Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP) delivered 
5,000 units of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) designed 
for use by MINSA medical personnel.  The Ministry of Health 
accepted the PPE's and will distribute them as needed to 
hospitals and other care centers throughout the country.  The 
DCM, along with USAID and DOD representatives, officially 
donated the items in a ceremony on May 12, which received 
wide press coverage. 
 
Embassy Preparedness and Outreach 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) The Embassy posted a warden message on H1N1 Influenza 
on April 28 and will release another message should Nicaragua 
confirm a case of H1N1, or if the WHO raises its alert level 
to Stage 6 (indicating a full pandemic).  The Consular 
Section has updated links and information on its website 
related to H1N1 and is staying in close contact with wardens 
to monitor developments in their areas of responsibility. 
 
¶9. (U) Comment:  MINSA's response to the outbreak has been 
impressive, given the lack of resources in the country.  The 
question remains as to how effective MINSA will be should an 
outbreak occur.
