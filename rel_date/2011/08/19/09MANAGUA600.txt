¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The Sandinista National Liberation Front 
(FSLN) political party and its Citizen Power Councils (CPCs) 
continue to embed themselves into the fabric of Nicaraguan 
life.  In addition to being behind recent public attacks 
against NGOs and serving as the primary distribution points 
for the Government of Nicaragua's (GON) Zero Hunger and other 
populist programs, CPCs now offer new public services: 
directing garbage collection priorities; collecting electric 
bills for a power company; providing medical information and 
referrals for swine flu victims; controlling water in rural 
areas; and setting up illegal structures on public property. 
Perhaps most troubling of all, CPCs are being called on by 
FSLN mayors to fill the jobs of public employees who are 
dismissed for not affiliating with the FSLN party.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
---------------------------- 
POLITICAL GARBAGE COLLECTION 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) By the end of the Nicaraguan summer (December to 
April), tons of garbage usually collect in Managua's 
extensive open storm drains and sewer system.  Every 
February, the Managua municipal government spends millions of 
cordobas (Nicaraguan official currency C$20/$1 USD) to remove 
debris that could clog storm drains and cause flooding when 
the heavy rains return in May/June.  Managua's new FSLN 
mayor, ex-boxer Alexis Arguello, announced on January 15 (his 
first day on the job) that the CPCs and the Managua municipal 
government were to work together in providing public 
services.  On February 10, 2009, local media reported that 
CPCs would set the Managua municipal garbage collection 
priorities.  On a simple piece of paper stuck to a municipal 
information blackboard, the Managua Fourth District work crew 
announced that the FSLN would determine priorities for 
garbage pickup.  Local media reported that a chronological 
municipal report of scheduled cleanup sites confirmed that 
CPC neighborhoods received priority garbage collection 
service over non-CPC neighborhoods, even where there was an 
FSLN-majority. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
COLLECTING ELECTRIC BILLS AS A PUBLIC SERVICE? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. (SBU) In March 2009, local media ran a series of headline 
stories about CPCs in Managua neighborhoods acting as 
collection agents for Union Fenosa, a Spanish company that 
distributes electricity in Nicaragua.  The GON currently has 
a 16 percent stake in Union Fenosa's Nicaraguan subsidiary 
and most Nicaraguans do not pay for their electricity - in 
one Managua neighborhood alone, it is estimated that 92 
percent of 1,800 clients have not paid their bills in months. 
 The National Assembly had refused to pass legislation that 
would pay millions of dollars owed to the company unless it 
could improve customer collections.  Calling them "Commissars 
of Light," CPC members were organized and paid to strong-arm 
their neighbors into paying their electrical bill in an 
effort to improve the image of Fenosa.  Union Fenosa 
spokesperson, Jorge Katin, admitted that hiring collection 
agents was a normal practice, but would not confirm that the 
company only hired CPC members since November 2008.  Marcos 
Carmona, a Nicaraguan human rights activist, confirmed the 
state-party confusion that the Fenosa practice of hiring CPCs 
to collect unpaid bills has created. 
 
------------------------------- 
SWINE FLU AWARENESS & REFERRALS 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) In April 2009, the Ministry of Health (MINSA) published an emergency handbook on swine flu that states that CPCs have a primary role in disseminating information regarding the symptoms and treatment for H1N1 virus. The handbook states that CPCs have a three-fold responsibility (along with the MINSA and 35,000 community health volunteers known as "brigadistas") to inform the general population about the virus, to identify cases of infection that require treatment, and to implement health measures (such as quarantines) to prevent the spread of the disease. While not explicitly stated in the handbook, Embassy health personnel were told by MINSA that a Nicaraguan who comes down with flu-like symptoms should report to their local CPCs or go to their local health centers.
 
------------------------ 
CONTROLLING WATER ACCESS 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) In May 2009, local media reported that CPCs were 
controlling water access to the rural communities of Palo de 
Pan and El Roble near Diriamba in the Carazo department, 
south of Managua.  The two communities have over 1,000 
residents and have not had adequate water supply for years 
from Enacal, the National Nicaraguan water service. 
Community leaders complained that for the past two years 
water was available once a week and usually during the night. 
 Now Enacal has given CPC leaders authority to open and close 
water lines.  According to local contacts, these CPC leaders 
were deliberately redirecting scare water resources to other 
CPC households instead of sharing it equally among residents. 
 When community members attended CPC meetings to complain, 
they were told that Enacal was at fault for the distribution 
problems.  Local media also reported a similar case in San 
Juan del Oriente, in which CPCs moved a water pump to another 
neighborhood that was "FSLN-friendly." 
 
----------------------------------- 
OCCUPYING PUBLIC PROPERTY ILLEGALLY 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) On May 20, 2009 local media reported that CPCs were 
illegally occupying public land in Chinandega.  According to 
the article, CPCs helped construct a vegetable stand and 
install a cement latrine on land that belonged to 
Chinandega's historic railroad station and now is under FSLN 
mayor Enrique Hidalgo's jurisdiction.  The site also 
illegally borrows water and electricity from a nearby public 
school.  The beneficiary of the new vegetable stand told 
reporters that the CPCs had permission directly from First 
Lady Rosario Murillo (who directly oversees the CPCs) to 
build on the site on the public land and borrow water and 
electricity from the school.  However, the FSLN mayor said 
that the CPCs were illegally occupying the site and that the 
municipality actually had plans to develop the land into a 
civic center for the community. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
STEALING JOBS FROM NON-FSLN PUBLIC WORKERS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) On May 20, 2009 a local newspaper revealed that the 
FSLN Mayor of Cuidad Dario, Angel Cardoza, ordered 44 CPC 
members to take over the positions of public workers he had 
fired for joining a non-FSLN aligned workers union.  The 44 
public workers illegally fired for their political 
affiliation had more than 20 years of experience in the 
municipal government and many were single mothers.  Starting 
in January 2009, the workers began losing their jobs to CPC 
members, who have no previous experience working in municipal 
government.  The 44 workers have filed appeals with the 
Ministry of Labor (MITRAB) for the violations of Nicaraguan 
labor laws and collective agreements, but have little hope 
that the FSLN-control MITRAB or the justice system will 
support their cause.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
8 (C) CPCs continue to embed themselves into Nicaragua's public service delivery systems - exercising control over garbage collection, water and electricity distribution, health services and even public lands and positions of trust. In FSLN-controlled municipalities, CPC influence over these public services increases each day. CPC members represent the "executive committee" of the local FSLN party structure, and are comprised of the most loyal forces within the party. CPCs are also vertically-integrated structures for governance, controlled directly by Ortega and Murillo, that duplicate both the GON and the party. In a country where economic conditions are deteriorating, party patronage is perhaps the best mechanism for assuring a piece of a shrinking economic pie. Even in FSLN-controlled administrations or neighborhoods, it increasingly appears that CPC membership has its own privileges and special access.
