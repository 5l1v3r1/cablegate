SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1.  In August 2008, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) resolved three 
Embassy registered property claims.  The Embassy's database now 
consists of 621 unresolved registered property claims belonging to 
296 Amcits.  To date, the overwhelming majority of resolutions have 
involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds 
("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of August 31, 2008, 
the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of $333,975,518.06 to 
Embassy-registered claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, 
the Ortega administration has resolved 52 claims, 5 during the 
2008-2009 waiver year. 
 
 
EMBASSY-REGISTERED CLAIMS RESOLVED IN AUGUST 2008 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 

¶2.  On August 18, 2008, Attorney General Hernan Estrada provided the 
Embassy a copy of the final settlement document or "finiquito" 
signed on August, 13, 2008, by U.S. citizen Norman Senfeld. 
According to the finiquito, Mr. Senfeld will receive two payments in 
the form of BPIs for his settlement.  He will receive the first 
payment at the beginning of September for the equivalent of $2.5 
million and the remaining $2.5 million in November 2009.  Mr. 
Senfeld's case represents three property claims registered with the 
Embassy Property Office.  We have updated our database to reflect 
this settlement.
