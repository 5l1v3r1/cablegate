SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
¶1. In October 2009, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of four Embassy registered property claims.  To date, 
the overwhelming majority of resolutions have involved compensation 
via government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de 
indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of October 31, 2009, the GON had 
issued BPIs with a face value of $359,906,310 to Embassy-registered 
claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, the Ortega 
administration has resolved 105 claims, ten of which during the 
2009-2010 waiver year.
