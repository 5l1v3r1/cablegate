Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) In his farewell call on the Ambassador, Humberto 
Arbulu-Neira, the outgoing IMF Resident Representative in 
Nicaragua, said that he now only gives the GON a 30 percent 
chance of successfully negotiating a budget support program 
with the IMF, due to the GON's failure to enact pension 
reform and curtail certain tax exemptions.  According to 
Arbulu, the GON plans to send a delegation to IMF 
headquarters in Washington on July 13.  Senior GON officials 
have indicated they may send a broad-based coalition with 
representatives from civil society, the Church and labor 
unions to present a "united front."  Arbulu told the 
Ambassador that the World Bank (WB) and the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) are now reconsidering their budget 
support to the GON, closely tracking the IMF's position.  If 
the GON is not successful in securing fiscal support, Arbulu 
predicted that this could trigger the GON to use its Central 
Bank reserves to fill the void, a move which could damage 
Nicaragua's macroeconomic stability.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) In his July 7 farewell call on Ambassador Callahan, 
outgoing IMF Resident Representative Humberto Arbulu-Neira 
told the Ambassador that he now predicts only a "30% chance" 
of a successful outcome in negotiations between the IMF and 
the GON on a new fiscal support program.  According to 
Arbulu, the primary obstacles to an agreement remain the 
GON,s reluctance to reform the pension system and curtail 
tax exemptions for "non-productive" entities, namely 
non-governmental organizations and churches.  These two 
measures, according to Arbulu, are politically difficult for 
the GON, especially because pension reform would upset local 
labor unions.  In any event, the Nicaraguan National Assembly 
is now in recess, so movement on either is unlikely in the 
short term. 
 
A "United Front" Delegation to Washington? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C) Meanwhile, Arbulu confirmed recent press reports that 
the GON plans to send a large delegation to IMF headquarters 
during the week of July 13-17 to lobby Managing Director 
Dominique Strauss-Kahn for an IMF program despite its failure 
to meet these requirements.  Arbulu told the Ambassador that 
originally the idea was to dispatch two prominent Nicaraguan 
businessmen:  Carlos Pellas, who dominates the rum/sugar 
sectors and who is active in a variety of other businesses 
such as banking and automotive dealerships, and Ramiro Ortiz 
Jr., head of BANPRO, Nicaragua's largest bank.  From there, 
according to Arbulu, President Ortega got hold of the issue 
and decided that sending a broader group to the IMF, 
including representatives of civil society, the Church and 
union leaders, would send a much stronger message of "unity" 
to the IMF in order to sway the organization toward approving 
a budget support package. 
 
¶4.  (C) A variety of statements on GON/IMF negotiations from 
senior-level GON officials have been widely broadcast here in 
recent days.  On July 7, Bayardo Arce Castano, Ortega's 
primary economic advisor, strongly castigated the IMF,s 
mandates on pension reform and decreasing tax exemptions as 
"unacceptable and inappropriate."  On the same day, Arce 
called for a delegation to present a "united front" to the 
IMF, including members of civil society and unions.  However, 
on July 9, Central Bank President Rosales adopted a much more 
business-like tone, essentially saying that the IMF and the 
GON each have the right to argue their respective positions. 
 
¶5. (C) On July 10, econoff met with Jose de Jesus de Rojas, General Manager of the Central Bank, who confirmed that the primary impediments to successful completion of the IMF program are pension reform and tax exemptions. He flagged the political sensitivities surrounding tax exemptions, as various National Assembly deputies enjoy a wide range of exemptions for their own "side-businesses." Rojas also confirmed that both Pellas and Ortiz will accompany Central Bank President Rosales to Washington on Monday, as will Jose Adan Aguerri, head of the Nicaraguan Federation of Business Associations (COSEP).
 
Pessimism on Nicaragua,s Macroeconomic Future 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Arbulu also told the Ambassador that the World Bank 
is now getting "cold feet" on whether or not to disburse its 
previously planned $20 million in 2009 budget support to the 
GON, and that the IDB is developing a similar reluctance. 
Arbulu said that both banks are closely watching IMF 
negotiations with Nicaragua.  When asked by the Ambassador 
about possible consequences in the event that the IMF program 
does not come through (in addition to cancellations of the 
World Bank and IDB support programs), Arbulu opined that the 
GON would likely tap Central Bank reserves (approximately $1 
billion) to plug its budgetary gap.  This could have negative 
effects on Nicaragua's macroeconomic stability and eventually 
lead to capital and exchange controls, whereby Nicaraguan 
depositors would only be allowed to withdraw limited amounts 
of dollars determined by the Central Bank. 
 
¶7.  (C) Arbulu, who has served as the IMF's Resident 
Representative in Nicaragua for five years, expressed his 
personal regret that Nicaragua appears vulnerable to 
macroeconomic instability after having made significant 
strides to improve its overall economic conditions.  As an 
aside, he told the Ambassador that during his tenure in 
Managua, he has met with President Ortega three times. 
Arubulu said that Ortega demonstrates little interest in or 
understanding of even basic economics.  Arbulu said that his 
conversations with Ortega usually follow a similar pattern: 
Arbulu raises important economic challenges, he solicits 
Ortega,s views, and then Ortega digresses into various 
unrelated anecdotes. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (C) In addition to Central Bank President Rosales and 
Minister of Finance Guevara, the full membership of the GON's 
delegation to IMF headquarters remains a bit of a mystery. 
Ultimately, the composition is in the hands of President 
Ortega and First Lady Rosario Murillo.  Arbulu suggested that 
if the GON does in fact send a broad-based "coalition" to 
Washington, comprised of union leaders and others unfamiliar 
with the technical aspects of the IMF,s proposed package, 
they would not get much of a hearing with the likes of 
Strauss-Kahn, and would be perceived as amateurish.
