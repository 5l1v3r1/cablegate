SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: JULY 2007

¶1. (U) Summary: In July of the 2006-2007 waiver year, the Government 
of Nicaragua (GON) did not resolve any Embassy-registered property 
claims.  Since January 1995, 2,514 Embassy-registered property 
claims belonging to 655 American citizens (Amcits) have been 
resolved.  There remain 679 registered property claims belonging to 
297 Amcits.  Including Amcit claims not registered with the Embassy, 
a total of 4,534 Amcits' claims have been resolved since January 
¶1995.  Most have involved compensation via government-issued 
indemnification bonds (bonos de pago de indemnizacion, or BPIs).  As 
of June 30, 2007, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of 
$321,300,000 to Embassy-registered claimants.  As of July 31, 2007, 
the face value of BPIs issued remains the same.  End Summary.
