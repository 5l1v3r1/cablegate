Recent Events 
------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) In support of an incipient political movement against MFIs, 
President Ortega accused Nicaraguan MFIs of "usurious lending" 
practices.  In July 2008, some protests turned violent in the 
northern department of Nueva Segovia (Ref B). One protest resulted 
in the kidnapping of a local MFI branch manager.  Another resulted 
in protesters setting fire to an MFI storefront in the city of 
Ocotal.  Still others resulted in road closures and the barricading 
of various MFIs. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Members of the financial community have commented that Ortega's rhetoric has contributed to the radical nature of these protests and a corresponding increase in country risk. Evidence suggests that the leaders of the protests are politically connected to Ortega's party, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), and that their purpose is to force small farmers to do business with ALBA-CARUNA (an FSLN-controlled, Venezuelan-funded rural cooperative bank). Otherwise, MFIs in Nicaragua are well regarded. At competitive interest rates, they have funded the expansion of many small agricultural producers in rural areas and small merchants in urban areas. Collectively, the current portfolio of MFI loans total some $600 million, a substantial proportion of total lending in Nicaragua. This segment of the market is attracting greater interest from major banks such as BAC Nicaragua.
