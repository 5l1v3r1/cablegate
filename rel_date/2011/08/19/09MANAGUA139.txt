SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: JANUARY 2009
 
SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. In January 2009, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) did not report 
the resolution of any Embassy registered property claims.  There 
remain 616 unresolved registered property claims belonging to 293 
U.S. citizens in the Embassy's database.  To date, the overwhelming 
majority of resolutions have involved compensation via 
government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de 
indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of November 30, 2008, the GON had 
issued BPIs with a face value of $334,156,014.76 to 
Embassy-registered claimants.  The GON did resolve one U.S. 
non-waiver claim, the first during the 2008-2009 waiver period. 
Since taking office in January 2007, the Ortega administration has 
resolved 57 claims, ten of which during the 2008-2009 waiver year. 
 
NO RESOLUTIONS IN JANUARY 
--------------------------- 

¶2. The GON did not resolve any U.S. citizen claims registered with 
the Embassy Property Office in January of the 2008-2009 waiver year. 
 
 
 
STATUS OF AMCIT PROPERTY AS OF 01/31/09 
--------------------------------------- 

¶3. The following is a snapshot of current U.S. citizen property 
claims.  The Embassy maintains separate databases for claims 
registered before and after the July 31, 2005 deadline in the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act.
