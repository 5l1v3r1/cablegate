SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: DECEMBER 2007
 
¶1. Summary: In December of the 2007-2008 waiver year, the legal 
representative for the heirs of a deceased American citizen claimant 
informed us that the GON resolved a claim registered in the 
Embassy's Property Office database. 
 
¶2. Since January 1995, the GON has resolved 2,519 Embassy-registered property claims belonging to 658 American citizens (Amcits). The Property Office database now includes 674 registered property claims belonging to 294 American citizens. Including American citizen claims not registered with the Embassy, the GON has resolved a total of 4,539 American citizen claims since January 1995. Most have involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs). As of December 31, 2007, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of $324,000,500 to Embassy-registered claimants. With the inclusion of this claim, the GON has resolved ten cases during CY07 and five this waiver year. End Summary.

¶4. On December 20, 2007, Dr. Rene Mendoza Corrales, legal 
representative for the heirs of Mr. Arturo Molina Garcia, provided a 
written statement to the Embassy Property Office attesting that GON 
had compensated Molina with indemnification bonds (BPIs) for a rural 
farm outside of Managua confiscated by the Sandinistas.  The heirs 
of Mr. Molina reached a settlement with the GON for BPIs with a face 
value of 50,270,700 cordobas, approximately $2,600,000.  We have 
updated our database to reflect this settlement.
