REF: SECSTATE 118429 
 
¶1.  On September 20, Econoff and ARSO met with Salvador Luna, 
owner of Armeria Magnum, at his store located in Centro 
Comercial, a large shopping center in Managua.  In response 
to Reftel questions, Luna told Emboffs that he founded 
Armeria Magnum in 2000.  Before then, Luna had worked for 
many years as a marksmanship trainer.  He still runs a 
separate target range and training facility.  (Note: RSO 
personnel and local guards train at Luna's facility.  End 
Note.)  Luna told Emboffs that a business partner operates a 
second Armeria Magnum store in Matagalpa.  Armeria Magnum has 
ordered 300 revolvers from Century Arms, but Luna said he 
would take delivery of only 100 revolvers this year. 
 
¶2.  Armeria Magnum is authorized by the National Police to 
import and sell firearms.  The sector is closely regulated by 
the Nicaraguan Government, Luna told Emboffs.  There are only 
four other firearms retailers in the country.  In addition to 
these retailers, to whom he may sell wholesale, Luna sells to 
individuals who provide evidence that they are authorized by 
the National Police to carry a firearm.  Requirements include 
a psychological evaluation, background check, and weapons 
familiarization training.  Luna reported that in 2006 he sold 
approximately 120 Israeli-made 9mm pistols and 150 
Turkish-made shotguns.  He was able to show electronic and 
paper records documenting these sales. 
 
¶3.  The store is protected 24 hours a day by an armed 
security guard employed directly by Armeria Magnum.  Guards 
employed by the shopping center provide additional security, 
and a police station is located 200 meters away.  The 
storefront is made of glass.  Firearms are displayed in 
unlocked cases.  Luna acknowledged that there is no alarm 
system. (Comment: ARSO suggested that Luna install a metal 
curtain to improve security at his store; however, ARSO 
believes current security satisfies minimum requirements. 
End Comment.)  In post's assessment, Armeria Magnum is a 
reliable recipient of United States Munitions List (USML) 
items.
