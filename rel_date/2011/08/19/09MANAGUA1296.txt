SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: NOVEMBER 2009
 
SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
¶1. In November 2009, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of 32 Embassy registered property claims.  Twenty-eight 
of these claims were properties under the control of the Nicaraguan 
Army.  One property was under the control of National Corporations 
of the Public Sector (CORNAP).  With the resolution of these 
claims, the GON has met two of the benchmarks required for 
Nicaragua to receive a Section 527 waiver during the 2009-2010 
period.  To date, the overwhelming majority of resolutions have 
involved compensation via government-issued indemnification bonds 
("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs).  As of November 30, 
2009, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of $363,641,210 to 
Embassy-registered claimants.  Since taking office in January 2007, 
the Ortega administration has resolved 137 claims, 42 during the 
current waiver year. 
 
 
 
EMBASSY REGISTERED CLAIMS RESOLVED IN NOVEMBER 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. On November 20, 2009, the Attorney General's Office provided the 
Embassy a copy of the final settlement document, or finiquito, 
signed by U.S. citizen Juan Barreto on November 19, 2009.  Mr. 
Barreto received BPIs worth 66,627,600 cordobas, approximately 
$3,208,587.  We have updated our database to reflect this 
settlement.  Mr. Barreto's claim represents 28 properties under the 
control of the Nicaraguan Army.  The resolution of the Barreto case 
represents the largest number of claims resolved for one U.S. 
citizen at one time.

Embassy a copy of the finiquito signed by U.S. citizen Indiana 
Gutierrez on November 24, 2009. Mrs. Gutierrez received BPIs worth 
5,084,400 cordobas, approximately $244,849.  We have updated our 
database to reflect this settlement.  Mrs. Gutierrez' property was 
under the control of CORNAP.

¶5. On December 2, 2009, the Attorney General's Office provided the Embassy a copy of the finiquito signed by U.S. citizen Manuel Vanegas on November 27, 2009. Mr. Vanegas received BPIs worth 314,300 cordobas, approximately $15,135. We have updated our database to reflect this settlement. Mr. Vanegas' claims had been previously dismissed by the GON because the Attorney General's Office alleged that he lacked documents that demonstrated that his property had been confiscated by the government.
