¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel, Embassy Managua reports three 
international submarine fiber optic telecommunication cables, two in 
the Caribbean and one in the Pacific, parallel to Nicaragua's coasts 
and within the country's 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone.  They are 
the Americas Region Caribbean Ring System (Arcos I), operated by a 
number of carriers including New World Network and Brightstar; the 
MAYA-1, operated by a consortium of operators including AT&T, MCI 
and Sprint; and Pan-American Crossing (PAC-1), operated by Global 
Crossing. 
 
¶2. (U) In March 2006, Nicaragua signed a contract to establish a 
connection to Arcos I, which connects Nicaragua with 14 countries, 
including the United States and Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, the Turks 
and Caicos Islands, the Dominican Republic, Curacao, Venezuela, 
Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and 
Mexico.  The cable has two landing points in Nicaragua, at Puerto 
Cabezas and Blueflieds.  In June 2007, Arcos I suffered damage in 
the area along the coast of Nicaragua between Puerto Cabezas and 
Bluefields.  More than half of the Internet users in Colombia had no 
service due to that problem, and Internet service and data 
transmission between Florida, Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Aruba, Puerto Rico, the 
Dominican Republic and the Bahamas was significantly slowed. 
 
¶3. (U) The MAYA-1 cable system links Colombia to Hollywood, Florida, 
with landing points in Mexico the Cayman islands, Honduras, Costa 
Rica and Panama, but none in Nicaragua.  The Pacific-based 5,280 
mile PAC-1 spans California to Panama, with no landing points in 
Nicaragua. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Embassy Managua reports no other critical infrastructure or 
key resources (CI/KR) vital to the United States' security, health, 
or safety.  This assessment was reached in consultation with 
relevant mission officers, including political, economic, security, 
defense, agriculture, facilities, and information resources.
