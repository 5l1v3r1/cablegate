Â¶1. Embassy La Paz supports the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) initiative to support microfinance institutions in Latin America. The three Bolivian microfinance institutions (Crecer, Diaconia, and Pro Mujer Bolivia) are non-profit, non-regulated NGOs that are authorized to provide credit only and cannot accept deposits from the public. All three entities are well-regarded within the microfinance community in Bolivia. Currently USAID/Bolivia is working directly with Pro Mujer Bolivia to support the provision of basic health services, but not to support the credit side of their operations. USAID/Bolivia does not work with either of the other institutions. Post is not aware of any potential ties to terrorism, money laundering, corruption, or violations of the law for any of the three institutions.
