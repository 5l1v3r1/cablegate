REF: MANAGUA 02546 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) seized over 540 
kilograms of cocaine on February 22 at the Penas Blancas 
vehicle inspection station.  According to post law 
enforcement sources, the NNP pulled the suspicious-looking 
vehicle aside as it crossed the border from Costa Rica. 
There were irregularities in the documents the driver 
presented and the vehicle was loaded with scrap metal and 
some 800 oil filters. (Comment:  Vehicles loaded with scrap 
metal often cross the border.  However, according to the NNP, 
oil filters are used to mask the scent of drugs and confuse 
the drug sniffing dogs. End Comment.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) After unloading the flatbed, the NNP found a 
20-foot long steel girder that showed marks of recent welding 
camouflaged with grease.  There 540 kilograms of cocaine were 
hidden in the girder and covered with dirt and cooking spices 
to mask the scent of the drugs )- which was so effective 
that the K-9s did not alert on the drugs until the girder had 
been dismantled.  The vehicle was apparently headed to 
Guatemala.  The driver of the vehicle is currently in police 
custody. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Penas Blancas vehicle inspection station, largely 
built with INL funds, provides a basic facility for the 
police to identify and inspect suspicious cargo trucks.  Over 
200 trucks pass daily through the station located on the 
border with Costa Rica.  After reviewing details on the 
drivers and cargo, the NNP thoroughly inspects around 10 
percent of the total number of trucks.  The officers use dogs 
to detect contraband (a Post-funded program) and then perform 
a detailed inspection of the vehicle and cargo.  The police 
frequently work with other regional law enforcement agencies 
and with the DEA on joint operations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  Repairs are urgently needed at the Penas 
Blancas vehicle inspection station to improve working 
conditions and officers' effectiveness in detecting 
contraband.  Post is trying to reprioritize projects and 
locate funds for the repairs.  We have already invested 
significant resources in building the inspection station and 
do  not want to see that investment wasted.  End Comment.
