Econ Off reviewed reftel points with Ranko Vilovic, Head of the UN 
Department at the Croatian MFA, on May 3.  Vilovic said that Croatia 
shares U.S. views about Zimbabwe's candidacy for chairmanship of the 
CSD, which is also a coordinated EU position.  Croatia will work 
with the African Group to find another suitable candidate, but is 
also prepared to vote against Zimbabwe if that outcome cannot be 
avoided. Vilovic noted that the African Group countries have been 
resistant to pressure thus far.  He added that Croatia is a 
candidate in the upcoming elections as well.
