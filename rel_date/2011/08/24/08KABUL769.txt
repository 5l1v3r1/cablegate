ENERGY CONFERENCE (WIREC) 
 
REF: STATE 26870 
 
Â¶1.  (U) The Embassy EPA Environmental Advisor discussed WIREC 2008 
(reftel) with Dad Mohammad Bahir, Deputy Executive Director General 
(Technical) of the Afghanistan National Environmental Protection 
Agency (NEPA) on March 23, 2008.  Congratulating Afghanistan for 
making a WIREC pledge on renewable Energy through the Ministry of 
Energy and Water, we asked if NEPA would also submit a WIREC pledge. 
 Bahir, who attended WIREC, said that NEPA would make a sustainable 
pledge on renewable Energy that would help NEPA assume its role as a 
key implementer of environmental conservation policy in Afghanistan. 
 The pledge will be submitted before April 4 and would assist and 
complement the Ministry of Energy pledge, including a possible 
public awareness campaign.
