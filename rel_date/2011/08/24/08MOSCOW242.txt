¶1.  (SBU)  On January 24, we delivered reftel points regarding the 
status of the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative to 
Russia's MFA Directorate of Disarmament and Security Affairs (DVBR). 
 In a January 29 meeting, DVBR Division Chief Aleksey Karpov told us 
that he understood the U.S. position and agreed that following a 
step-by-step approach to the dissemination of the draft for an NSG 
waiver was the best approach.  He noted Russian concerns regarding 
the NSG waiver decision for India: India's insistence on asking for 
"special treatment" with respect to the IAEA safeguards agreement 
and the continued lack of clarity in China's position. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Karpov stated that solid support may be lacking from some 
NSG members because of India's stance regarding the IAEA safeguards 
agreement.  He also speculated that many of the smaller NSG 
countries would avoid taking a formal position, but would not block 
consensus.
