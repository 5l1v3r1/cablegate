REF: STATE 71547 
 
¶1. (U) Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials 
agreed to review the reftel request to increase contributions 
to ISAF, but noted they did not expect the review to bring 
about any changes to current contribution levels.  Portugal 
is operating, they stated, under an austerity budget. 
Moreover, Portugal will assume the European Union presidency 
on July 1, with the additional expenditures that go with that 
duty.  Nonetheless, interlocutors stress that Portugal 
remains committed to keeping its commando company in 
Afghanistan -- without caveats -- through at least February 
¶2008. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ministry of Defense colleagues also agreed to 
consider the reftel request.  Without making any promises, 
they speculated that they might be able to contribute some 
armored personnel carriers (M113) and uniforms, but noted the 
need to investigate the possibility further.  (Note:  the 
APCs in question are in need of renovation and no funds have 
yet been allocated to cover the costs of that activity, 
transport to Afghanistan, or of any further operations.  End 
note.)
