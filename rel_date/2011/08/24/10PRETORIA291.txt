Partnerships

¶12.  (Response to paragraph 30 of Ref A.) 
 
-- A.  The SAG is widely engaged, at both national and local 
levels, in a range of intergovernmental and public-private 
partnerships to mobilize against trafficking.  As noted 
above, the European Commission (EC) extensively funded 
NPA/SOCA grants to lay the groundwork for legislation, 
training, monitoring, and awareness raising.  (Poloff 
believes Norway or another Scandinavian country may also have 
provided funding through IOM.)  As for the USG, Post is 
working to facilitate State/GTIP support to the SAG's law 
enforcement efforts through its provincial interagency task 
teams. 
 
With respect to civil society, the SAG has partnerships both 
on policy leadership (e.g. Molo Songololo representing NGOs 
on the interagency task team, and municipal participation in 
NGOs' anti-TIP consortia in provinces like the Western Cape, 
Mpumalanga, and Limpopo), legislative development (via 
extensive consultations and solicitations of input to the TIP 
Bill -- the very process that has slowed its progress), and 
operations (e.g. through DSD collaboration with private 
shelters on victims' assistance). 
 
Finally, the SAG has close collaborations with multilateral 
organizations, principally IOM, ILO, and UNODC. 
 
-- B.  The SAG's international assistance on TIP to other 
governments has been in the form of hosting conferences on 
the formulation of TIP legislation, Action Plans, and 
development of anti-TIP institutional capacity.  In September 
2009 NPA/SOCA hosted its so-called "all Africa" convention, 
inviting officials from around the continent to compare 
progress on TIP; it participated in a Southern African 
Development Community (SADC) forum working toward fulfilment 
of SADC member states' commitments to have national Action 
Plans by 2015; and it hosted smaller groupings of adjacent 
countries to attend conferences on gender issues that, inter 
alia, addressed trafficking.

¶13.  (Response to paragraphs 31-33 of Ref A.)  This section 
is not applicable to South Africa, which has not been subject 
to allegations of unlawful child soldiering.

¶14.  (Response to paragraph 34 of Ref A.) 
 
For the second year, post applauds Fair Trade in Tourism 
South Africa (FTTSA), whose initiatives to protect children 
from exploitation in sex tourism are especially relevant in 
this World Cup year.  As reported previously, FTTSA has led 
the campaign to introduce "The Code of Conduct for the 
Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and 
 
PRETORIA 00000291  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
Tourism" (http://www.thecode.org) to South Africa.  The Code 
is a worldwide campaign committing signatories to six 
concrete anti-TIP actions related to institutional policy, 
training, contracting, awareness-raising among clients and 
counterparts, and reporting.  This initiativee was launched 
by the Swedish NGO ECPAT, on whose steering committee FTTSA 
holds one of the NGO seats for 2008-10, with UNICEF funding 
and WTO support.  For its part, FTTSA 
(http://www.fairtourismsa.org.za) is a local nonprofit 
encouraging tourism that is sustainable and respectful 
vis-a-vis environmental resources and culture, and that is 
ethical and equitable to local communities.  By FTTSA's 
action, South Africa joins Kenya in leading the Africa 
continent towards adoption of the Code. 
 
FTTSA's work on the Code gained momentum during the reporting 
period.  UNICEF (in coordination with the ILO) committed 
funding for piloting the Code during the World Cup 
competition, to kick-start its implementation thereafter.  In 
the next three months before the games, FTTSA aims to sign on 
ten large companies in the tourism industry whose facilities 
will then become distribution channels for marketing 
materials protecting children.  Target partners include hotel 
chains (such as world partner Accor), rental car companies, 
and airlines.  Materials are in development by local 
advertising firms, aiming to deliver serious warnings without 
overly scary or shocking effect.  The aim is balanced 
messaging, to portray South Africa as a wholesome travel 
destination, where families are welcome and exploitation is 
not tolerated, while at the same time encouraging alertness 
to the issue.  The Code has also been incorporated into the 
DSD's Child Protection Strategy mentioned earlier, and FTTSA 
will support UNICEF's efforts to create "child friendly 
zones" in ten official fan parks.

Commendable Initiatives

¶15.  (Response to paragraph 35 of Ref A.) 
 
International faith-based organizations the Alliance of 
Christians Against Trafficking (ACT), in partnership with 
Youth With A Mission (YWAM) and Ultimate Goal, which have 
historically been involved in major global sporting 
championships, have enlisted a projected 3,000 volunteers 
from overseas to promote awareness and prevent TIP during the 
2010 World Cup.  The volunteers, whose airfare, travel, and 
lodging costs will be paid by themselves or their home 
churches without SAG or FIFA assistance, will bring specific 
skills in physical education, medical assistance, and child 
protection.  These YWAM staff will help generate recreation 
opportunities for unaccompanied kids flocking to fan parks 
when schools are suspended during the games.  ACT will train 
at least 1,000 of them specifically on trafficking, to 
distribute anti-TIP pamphlets in game areas and man 
lost-children booths and TIP information stands.  Post has 
put ACT in contact with other groups engaged in the Child 
Qput ACT in contact with other groups engaged in the Child 
Protection Strategy, so that their volunteers can be 
channeled to the sites with the greatest needs for 
supervision.
