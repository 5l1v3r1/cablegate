SUBJECT: SAUDI ARABIA: NOMINATION OF PRINCESS LOULWA AL 
FAISAL BIN ABDULAZIZ FOR INTERNATIONAL WOMEN OF COURAGE 
AWARD 
 
REF: STATE 126072 
 
¶1. (U) Post is pleased to nominate Princess Loulwa Al Faisal 
for the Secretary of State's Award for International Women of 
Courage.  Princess Loulwa is the daughter of the late King 
Faisal Bin Abdulaziz and Queen Effat Al Thunayaan, as well as 
the sister of Foreign Minister Saud Al Faisal.  She is well 
known for her dedication to promoting women's education and 
social and family welfare. 
 
¶2. (U) Princess Loulwa has been a pioneer in female 
education, helping to supervise Saudi Arabia's first private 
high school for girls -- Dar Al Hanan School.  She also 
assisted her mother, Queen Effat, in establishing Saudi 
Arabia's first women's college -- Effat College -- in 1999. 
Princess Loulwa currently serves as the President and Chair 
of the Board of Trustees of Al Maharat Cognitive and Skill 
Development Center in Jeddah, the Vice Chair and General 
Supervisor of Dar Al Hanan School, and on Effat College's 
Board of Trustees.  She is a board member of the Riyadh-based 
King Faisal Foundation, which has established the Kingdom's 
newest and most progressive university with the stated 
intention of becoming the Kingdom's first co-educational 
university.  Princess Loulwa is also a member of Al Nadha 
Philanthropic Society for Women, which is also based in 
Riyadh. 
 
¶3. (U) Princess Loulwa has been a frequent lecturer on 
women's issues in international fora.  She also actively 
advocates for women's rights in the Kingdom, pushing for more 
opportunities for women in fields such as business, 
engineering, and the sciences.  Known anecdotally as the 
"first ambassador for Saudi women," Princess Loulwa has 
helped many women in the Kingdom achieve their goal of 
advanced education. 
 
¶4. (U) Loulwa is no stranger to personal sacrifice in the 
fight for reform.  Her father, King Faisal, who was 
assassinated in 1975, implemented many reforms during his 
reign -- including the introduction of education for girls, 
which he implemented against significant conservative 
opposition.  A true "woman of courage," Princess Loulwa 
recognizes the delicate balance between the need for 
empowering women and managing change in traditionally 
conservative culture.  "We are taking our time," she is 
quoted as saying, "and we are getting our way." 
 
¶5. (U) Post would be happy to facilitate contact for 
Department officials with Princess Loulwa  Political Officer 
Jennifer Saporia King (kingjs@state.gov) is Post's point of 
contact on women's issues.
