REF: CARACAS 1332 
 
¶1. (SBU) On 09/23/2008, a group of approximately 50 
demonstrators gathered outside the main entrance of Embassy 
Caracas.  Post officials received advance notice of the 
protest and in light of increased anti-U.S. rhetoric from the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (BRV), decided it was 
prudent to cancel Non-Immigrant Visa (NIV) operations for the 
day. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The demonstration took place at 11:00 and lasted 
approximately one hour. Demonstrators carried flags and 
banners identifying themselves as supporters of the Communist 
Party of Venezuela (PCV).  Oscar Figueroa, PCV Secretary 
General, and Yul Jabour, A PVC National Assembly deputy, led 
the demonstrators.  RSO had been made aware of the planned 
demonstration over a week in advance, and had requested 
police support and extra guard force coverage for the event. 
Local municipal police provided a timely contingent of about 
10 motorcycle officers; however, the small crowd was able to 
block vehicle entry/exit into the main entrance for the 
duration of the protest.  Demonstrators shouted anti-American 
slogans and presented a paper with similar Yankee-go-home 
content to an American officer before departing the area. 
The demonstration was peaceful and ended without incident. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Given the venomous anti-American rhetoric from the 
BRV, recent expulsion of the Ambassador, and planned 
demonstration in front of Embassy Caracas, Post elected to 
suspend consular NIV services on 09/23/2008.  That morning, 
an unknown person had tossed a tear gas grenade into the 
compound of Globovision, an opposition media outlet.  Concern 
for the safety of visa applicants made sending NIV applicants 
home for the day both prudent and necessary to avoid 
potential security incidents.  Applicants who arrived at the 
embassy seeking visas were told to return on 09/25/2008 for 
visa services. Public Affairs provided local press reasons 
for the closure, and a 09/24/2008 article in the local daily 
"El Universal" was entitled "The Closure of U.S. Visas in 
Caracas is not Dismissed."  Although extra security personnel 
were in place to handle the large numbers of visa applicants 
being denied entry, there were no incidents or security 
problems as the result of the closure. 
 
¶4. (SBU) MFA USA Desk Officer Marie Borregales called 
A/PolCouns 09/24/2008 to follow up on press reports of the 
Embassy's closing of the NIV section on 09/23/2008.  She 
stressed that the MFA took very seriously the security 
concerns raised by Charge in his 09/19/2008 meeting with MFA 
Director of North American Affairs Yaneth Arocha (reftel). 
Borregales said the MFA contacted the Director of Citizen 
Security in the Caracas Mayor's Office, who in turn, alerted 
the Metropolitan Police to be responsive to Embassy's 
security concerns.  Asked whether she anticipated that 
Venezuela's special police (DISIP) would be more responsive 
in the future, Borregales said that MFA did not contact DISIP.
