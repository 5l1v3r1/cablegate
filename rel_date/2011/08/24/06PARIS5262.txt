DESTRUCTIONS 
 
REF: PARIS 5154 
 
¶1.  On July 30, anti-biotech activists struck again in southwestern 
France destroying a Pioneer biotech test plot and, for the first 
time, commercial fields of biotech corn.  Although activists are 
continuing to express their anti-biotech stance in this manner 
(reftel), we have noted that a growing number of French corn 
producers are embracing the technology in 2006.   The corn fields 
targeted by the group of "Voluntary Cutters" (Faucheurs Volontaires) 
belonged to farmers who had publicly affirmed their position in 
favor of biotechnology and acknowledged that they were themselves 
growing biotech corn this year. 
 
¶2.  While police on the scene did not stop the protesters from 
destroying the biotech corn fields, they subsequently arrested and 
detained five suspects and held them in custody for two days. These 
protesters are likely to be brought to trial in September.  More 
protesters may be arrested, including the infamous activist Jose 
Bove, who recently received a two month jail term for a prior 
destruction. 
 
¶3.  Anti-biotech activists continue to be very vocal in support of 
their position and receive wide coverage in the daily French press. 
Nevertheless, approximately two hundred French corn growers, 
representing both biotech and non-biotech interests, rallied at a 
demonstration of support on Tuesday for the farmers whose biotech 
fields were destroyed. 
 
¶4.  The French Ministry of Agriculture (MinAg) quickly issued a 
press communique on July 31st condemning the acts which destroyed 
biotech plots and commercial cultivation of crops which are produced 
legally in France.  The MinAg stated that, to date, 40 percent of 
the biotech test plots authorized in 2006 have been destroyed.  The 
latest MinAg communique is particularly noteworthy, since before 
this incident, they did not have a strong track record of condemning 
such behavior. 
 
¶5.  The press release said that Agriculture Minister Bussereau 
"strongly condemns these acts of vandalism contrary to rule of law 
and to the respect for private property."  He affirmed his support 
to farmers and researchers who are "victims of illegal cutting." 
Finally, the communiqu stated that firm instructions have been 
given to local authorities to guarantee the security of biotech test 
plots and that legal proceedings will be launched systematically 
against those who destroy biotech crops. 
 
¶6.  Comment:  Political tension on the issue of biotech cultivation 
continues to run high in France.  A biotech bill is currently 
lingering in the legislative process, but further action will 
probably be viewed as politically unpalatable prior to the 
Presidential and parliamentary elections in 2007.  In addition, 
France's regional Chambers of Agriculture will be holding elections 
in January 2007.  The current majority at the regional Chambers is 
held by the farming association FNSEA, which is not opposed to 
biotech.  Alternative organizations less favorable to biotech (such 
as the activist Confederation Paysanne) and with differing views on 
the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, could win a sizeable number of 
seats in the next election, should popular opinion in France's 
farming sector change.  We will monitor this closely as the winter 
election approaches.  End Comment.
