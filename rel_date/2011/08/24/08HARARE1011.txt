¶1.  Following is the text of a congratulatory message from Robert 
Mugabe to the President-elect of the United States of America, Mr. 
Barack Obama.  Under the terms of a yet-to-be-implemented power

¶2.  BEGIN TEXT.  Your Excellency 
 
On behalf of the Government and people of the Republic of Zimbabwe 
and indeed on my own behalf, I wish to extend our hearty 
congratulations on your election as the 44th President of the United 
States of America.  Your election to the high office of the 
President of that great country is testimony to the confidence that 
the American people have in you. 
 
As the Government and people of Zimbabwe join you in celebrating 
this event in the history of the USA, I take this opportunity to 
assure you Mr President-elect that the Government of the Republic of 
Zimbabwe remains ready to engage your Government in any desirable 
endeavour to improve our bilateral relations. 
 
Mr President-elect, the challenges that now lie ahead of you are 
enormous and those of us in the small and developing countries 
cherish the hope of working with your new Administration as we 
pursue our programmes and policies to develop our societies in the 
global context of socio-economic interaction. 
 
I wish you personal good health, peace and prosperity to the people 
of the United States of America. 
 
Yours sincerely, R.G. Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe. 
 END TEXT.
