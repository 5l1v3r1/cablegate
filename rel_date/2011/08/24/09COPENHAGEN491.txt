(SBU) After considerable internal deliberation, Denmark has 
decided to allocate 50 million Danish Kroner (DKK; not quite 
USD10 million) for the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of 
Africa (reftel), half each to UNICEF and WFP.  These are new 
funds in addition to any other contributions provided for WFP 
and UNICEF this year.  The country allocations are as follows: 
 
- Somalia 21 million DKK (approx. USD4 million) 
 
- Ethiopia 14 million DKK (not quite USD3 million) 
 
- Kenya 10 million DKK (not quite USD2 million) 
 
- Southern Sudan 5 million DKK (not quite USD1 million).
