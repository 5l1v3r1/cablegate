(SBU) The Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has indicated that 
the GOI is willing to co-sponsor a resolution requesting UNSCR 1267 
listing for the two individuals named in Ref A.  Ambassador Mohammed 
al-Humaimidi, our MFA contact on terrorist financing issues, said 
the Prime Minister's Office agreed on November 24 to support a 
co-resolution, and that the MFA would instruct the Iraqi Mission to 
the United Nations to approach USUN on the issue and to submit a 
request to list the two individuals "very soon."  Al-Humaimidi also 
said the MFA would be sending Embassy Baghdad a diplomatic note to 
confirm the GOI's positive response to our demarche (Ref B and Ref 
C).  To our knowledge, this is the first time that the GOI has 
co-sponsored a resolution on terrorist financing with us in a 
multi-national forum.
