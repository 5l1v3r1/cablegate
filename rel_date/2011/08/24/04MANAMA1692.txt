(SBU) EconOff delivered reftel points to Ghassan Shaikho, MFA 
Director of International Organizations, on November 9. 
Shaikho indicated that Bahrain had not yet formulated its 
final position on any of the six resolutions before the Third 
Committee (as outlined in Ref. B).  He did say that he 
expected Bahrain would not support the Belarus sponsored 
resolution criticizing the U.S. electoral process (Ref. A) 
and that Bahrain will likely abstain on the U.S./EU sponsored 
resolution on Belarus.  Citing reasons of "regional 
solidarity," Shaikho added that he expects Bahrain will vote 
against the resolution on Iran (as it has done in the past) 
and against the resolution on Sudan.  Shaikho said Bahrain's 
position on the Turkmenistan and Zimbabwe resolutions is 
still open for discussion, although he indicated that he 
expects Bahrain will follow the Africa Group's lead on 
Zimbabwe.
