SUBJECT: EGYPT:  PARLIAMENT APPROVES HARMONIZATION OF 
CUSTOMS WITH WCO STANDARDS 
 
 
¶1.  Egypt's upper parliamentary chamber, the Shura Council, 
has ratified the government's decision to join the 
"International Convention on the Simplification and 
Harmonization of Customs Procedures" (Kyoto Convention) to 
reduce barriers to Egypt's international trade.  Under the 
convention, Egypt is obligated to harmonize its customs 
procedures in accordance with World Customs Organization 
(WCO) standards. Egypt brings the total WCO membership to 
56 countries; trade between member countries covers 80% of 
international trade.  Egypt's membership takes effect in 
April 2008. 
 
¶2.  Egypt's accession was formally approved in October 2007 
by presidential decree, and ratified by parliament in 
December 2007.  WCO adopted the "revised Kyoto Convention" 
in 1999. The convention contains modern customs documents 
and procedures to be used in international trade and 
transport.
