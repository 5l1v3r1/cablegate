¶A. "Integrity and Corruption" 
(Editorial by Mohammed Jubair - Kitabat - "Writings" Website 
(http://www.kitabat.com) - independent based in Germany) 
 
"Wherever you find corruption, you also find integrity. This 
is an everlasting duality linked to the existence of good 
people and bad people, and in Iraq, an integrity commission 
has been established to monitor the performance of 
government institutes and prevent administrative corruption. 
 
"With the rule of law subsiding against the ruler's law, 
corruption can be found at the top of executive hierarchies, 
and it is no longer a shameful subject to mention. 
The integrity commission carries the huge burden of serious 
corruption issues, and according to Judge Radhi Al-Radhi, 
the head of the Commission on Public Integrity, in several 
interviews, he fears the effects of the disclosure of these 
cases and the names of those involved in administrative 
corruption and the abuse of public funds. 
 
"If an official or even an ordinary person addresses this 
subject, he will start to blame the former regime for 
passing on its corrupt heritage to the current government 
which has prepared a suitable environment for corruption. 
But corruption of the past doesn't justify that of today, 
and higher levels at ministries and institutes should be the 
first frontier in stranding up to and eliminating such 
practices, rather than being the first to take part in them. 
 
"The huge responsibility of the commission, and the large 
number of cases investigated but yet to be announced, place 
the commission's employees and their families under the fear 
of serious threats, and these threats are realistic in a 
situation where those defending what is right become the 
weaker party against the powerful defenders of wrong. But 
this situation is a temporary stage that shouldn't last, and 
the rule of law should prevail again. The people should be 
able to hold accountable all those taking advantage of the 
country's wealth, and at the end of the day, righteousness 
is the only thing to prevail."
