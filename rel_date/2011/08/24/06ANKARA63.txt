¶1.      Summary:   EXBS Advisor coordinated meetings to 
continue the development of the Commodity Identification 
Training (CIT) project and End Use/End User training for 
Turkish export license reviewer. EXBS Advisor continued to 
work with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK) 
concerning development of Turkish nuclear energy program and 
in the development of a program to increase the cooperation 
in the development of an improved nuclear safety program in 
Iraq.  Finally, Turkey's MFA requested a change in the 
wording of the title of the NP Cooperation Agreement, which

¶2.      Completed Actions for the Reporting Period 
 
¶A.        Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent 
Reporting Period 
 
1)          December 5- EXBS Advisor participated in a 
meetings with representatives of Undersecretariat of Foreign 
Trade  (UFT), Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK), the 
Istanbul Mineral and Metals Association (IMMIB) and DOE INECP 
representatives.  The meeting focused on the importance of an 
active industry outreach program to keep industry up to date 
with changes to the many control lists for both nuclear items 
and dual use items.  DOE representatives outlined the 
importance of proper licensing procedures not just for 
equipment but for the intellectual capability that could be 
exported from Turkey.  This transfer of knowledge is 
developing into more of a problem as individuals with certain 
skill sets are recruited by countries or organizations which 
desire to develop nuclear or other potentially dangerous 
capabilities. 
 
2)          December 8-  EXBS Advisor participated with DOE 
INECP representatives in a meeting of the CIT Core Technical 
Group.  Discussions focused on current status of the CIT 
Training Plan, instructor training, and the development of 
Turkish specific course curriculum.  Milestones were 
established concerning the training of initial instructors, 
course curriculum and training aids with a goal of conducting 
the first Turkish led pilot course by late summer. 
 
On the margins of the CIT meetings, EXBS Advisor had a 
discussion with President of Turkish Atomic Energy Authority 
(TAEK), Okay Cakiroglu.  Cakiroglu informed us that he has 
spoken to various countries concerning the construction of 
nuclear power plants in Turkey and his desire for U.S. 
participation in this program. (Ref C).  Cakiroglu also 
stated that he had recently returned from a conference in 
Amman Jordan where he spoke to the head of the Jordanian 
Nuclear Authority concerning joint cooperation to assist the 
development of a nuclear safety program in Iraq. (Ref D). 
 
3)          December 9- EXBS Advisor met with 
Undersecretariat of Foreign Trade (UFT) Deputy Director 
General for Exports Hassan Yalcin to review the progress of 
the ICP project and present an alternative course of action 
to begin customization of the software.  Yalcin informed EXBS 
Advisor that UFT would like to deliberate on the U.S. 
proposal of moving to a new contractor from the previously 
selected Siemens Corp. Also to ensure that Siemens is no 
longer interested in the project, a follow on meeting between 
UFT, Siemens and EXBS Advisor was scheduled (see below). 
 
4)          December 29-   EXBS Advisor met with Customs 
Enforcement Head of Department Ender Gurleyik to discuss 
recent Turkish Customs activities.  Gurleyik outlined 
upcoming improvements that will be accomplished at several 
border crossings, including Harbur and Kapikule.   Gurleyik 
reiterated the desire of customs to continue to work closely 
with the United States in attempts to stop the illegal 
 
ANKARA 00000063  002 OF 002 
 
 
transfer of nuclear or dual use items in or through Turkey. 
Gurleyik also reviewed recent arrests and seizures 
accomplished by Customs, mostly focusing on illegal drugs and 
cigarettes. 
 
5)          December 30 - EXBS Advisor met with 
representatives of UFT and Siemens Corp to discuss current 
status of the ICP project.  EXBS Advisor reviewed the Siemens

revised the scope of work to fit more in line with expected 
scope and budget expectations.  These changes were 
tentatively approved by UFT, Siemens agreed and will prepare 
and submit a new budget proposal in early January.

identifying resources to be used when evaluating end user of 
items requiring licenses.
