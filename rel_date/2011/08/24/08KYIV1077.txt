¶1. (SBU) Summary: Parliament adopted a bill on June 3 to 
lower Ukraine's tariff rates in line with commitments made 
during WTO accession negotiations.  The law as adopted, 
however, delays tariff reductions for a large number of 
goods until 2009, in contradiction to accession 
commitments.  The bill passed with a veto-proof majority, 
but there might be prospects for the veto to be sustained 
if President Yushchenko does veto the bill.  Two other WTO- 
related laws have passed in the first reading, one has 
failed, and one has yet to come up for a vote.  Post 
intends to deliver a strong message to the GOU regarding 
our displeasure with the Customs Tariff Law, and to 
encourage resolution of other outstanding WTO commitments. 
End Summary. 
 
Tariff Law Passes with Problematic Exceptions 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Ukraine's Rada (parliament) adopted a bill on June 3 
amending the Law "On the Customs Tariff of Ukraine," meant 
to bring into force the bound tariff rates agreed to as 
part of Ukraine's WTO accession negotiations.  (Note: 
Ukraine became the 152nd member of the WTO on May 16, but 
failed to adopt beforehand all of the outstanding 
legislation promised during accession talks (reftel).  End 
note.)  The version of the law that passed delays tariff 
reductions until January 1, 2009 for a sizeable list of 
goods, including various types of meat and poultry, cocoa 
powder and chocolate, wines and other fermented beverages, 
and certain kinds of automobiles.  (Note: A complete list 
of tariff lines for which tariff reductions have been 
delayed is provided in para 9 of this cable.  End note.) 
 
¶3. (U) The bill passed by a wide margin, with 367 MPs from 
the ruling coalition and opposition voting in favor, and 
will come into effect once signed by the President.  The 
President can choose to veto the bill, but the Rada needs 
only 300 votes to override a veto.  However, if the 
President's Our Ukraine faction were to oppose an override, 
theoretically there would be enough votes to sustain the 
veto.  President Yushchenko has not yet made any statements 
on whether he will sign or veto the measure. 
 
¶4. (SBU) While this draft law was still working its way 
through the legislative process, the Tymoshenko government 
had issued instructions to the State Customs Service to 
apply the lowered tariff rates from May 16 regardless of 
the lack of Rada action on the bill(reftel).  Although the 
legality of these instructions was questionable, informal 
feedback from local industry reps confirmed that Customs 
was in fact charging the lower tariff rates.  Vyacheslav 
Yandrykhinskiy, from home and food products giant Unilever, 
told Econoff he understood that the special instructions to 
Customs would only be valid until a new law came into 
effect, however.  (Comment: In theory, the GOU could try to 
continue to implement the lowered tariffs, ignoring the law 
just passed by the Rada, but doing so would be extremely 
controversial as an encroachment on the legitimate rights 
of the legislature.  End Comment.) 
 
Two Other Bills Successfully Through 1st Reading 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5. (U) The Rada has passed two other outstanding WTO bills 
in the first reading.  Those draft laws are: 
 
-- Draft Amendment to the Law "On Veterinary Medicine" (to 
ensure that the production of beef with hormones, the 
assessment of "contaminants" and "maximum residue limits," 
and the regulation on the system of animal identification 
are in compliance with the SPS Agreement, CODEX 
Alimentarius, and our bilateral agreement); and 
 
-- Draft Amendment to the Law "On Fish, Other Water Living 
Resources, and Food Production from Them" (to ensure 
compliance with the norms of the WTO TBT and SPS 
Agreements). 
 
 
KYIV 00001077  002 OF 003 
 
 
One Law Voted Down, One not yet on the Docket 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Rada has voted down one draft law, an 
amendment to the Law "On Safety and Quality of Food 
Products" (to bring Ukraine's inspection regime into line 
with WTO rules by clarifying that standards are not 
mandatory).  Vyacheslav Tsymbal, Director of the Ministry 
of Economy's WTO Department, told Econoff that, unless the 
GOU got a clear sign that a majority could be found for 
this law, the GOU would have to alternatively try to 
accomplish the main goals of the draft law through 
regulatory changes. 
 
¶7. (U) The Rada has also yet to vote on a final piece of 
outstanding legislation, an Amendment to Several Laws (to 
eliminate the zero VAT rate for agricultural producers, and 
to eliminate a difference in excise duty rates for the 
commodity group UKTZED 220820 (spirits received from 
processing grape wines)). 
 
Comment: Dealing with Legislative Failure 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Passage of the Customs Tariff Law with such a 
large number of products exempted from immediate tariff 
reductions sends a bad signal about Ukraine's willingness 
to meet its WTO commitments.  Although amounting to a delay 
of only a little more than six months, the move contradicts 
a fundamental principle of the WTO accession process and 
will hurt U.S. exporters.  Post intends to make use of 
several upcoming visits by high-level USG officials to 
hammer this message home to the GOU, and to push with other 
like-minded Embassies for meeting other outstanding WTO 
commitments. 
 
List of Delayed Tariff Lines
