H1N1 in Germany.  This increases the total number of confirmed

in England.  The new cases were distributed among the federal 
states as follows: Hesse (1), North Rhine-Westphalia (1), 
Saxony (1), Thuringia (1), and Bavaria (2). 
 
¶3. (SBU) RKI reported that a 17-year old student from 
Starnberg (Bavaria) has the virus after returning from 
England, where he attends boarding school. He had returned to 
Germany to visit his family.  Media report note that his 
family was quarantined as a precautionary measure.  RKI also 
reports on a woman from Bavaria who is being tested for the 
virus. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Media reports also indicate that a 24-year old 
student from Kassel (Hesse) has the virus.  He was reportedly 
on the same flight from New York to Frankfurt as the 47-year

a practitioner from Duesseldorf who may have been infected 
with the virus by taking care of a family who was previously 
confirmed to have the virus.  The man is reportedly 
asymptomatic.
