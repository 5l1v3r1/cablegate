¶1. (SBU) In response to ref A on foreign government 
applications of the Arab League Boycott (ALB), the Saudi 
government (SAG) is not imposing secondary or tertiary 
aspects of the ALB.  Ambassador Smith and visiting AUSTR 
Chris Wilson discussed the ALB with Minister of Commerce and 
Industry Alireza, who categorically denied that Saudi Arabia 
was doing so, explaining that, in Saudi Arabia's WTO Working 
Party Report, the Saudi Government reiterated that it had 
eliminated these two parts of the boycott.  Alireza stressed 
at the time that he wanted to be kept personally informed of 
any allegations that any entity in Saudi Arabia was seeking 
to enforce these aspects of the boycott (ref C).  Moreover, 
in numerous discussions with private sector contacts on this 
issue, all have reported that the Kingdom had taken no action 
towards reinstating (or otherwise implementing) a secondary 
or tertiary boycott of Israel (ref B). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post thanks Commerce for sending detailed 
information regarding four companies alleged to have issued 
prohibited or permissible boycott-related requests in Saudi 
Arabia (ref D).  In addition to recent high-level engagement, 
Post is formally sending information regarding the four 
companies to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and has 
requested a meeting with the Ministry's Boycott office once 
the SAG returns from the Hajj and Eid holiday December 5. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In the interim, Post offers the following response 
to ref A questions: 
 
-- The SAG does not require U.S. firms to comply with the 
secondary or tertiary aspects of the ALB. 
 
-- Legally, Saudi Arabia ended its secondary and tertiary 
boycotts of Israel through Council of Ministers Decision No. 
5 of June 13, 1995. 
 
-- The SAG does not, as a matter of policy, request that U.S. 
firms comply with secondary and tertiary boycott requirements. 
 
-- The SAG's boycott practices have not, as previously 
reported, had an impact on U.S. businesses (ref B). 
 
-- The SAG maintains an ALB office in the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry.  Post will inquire about the offices' 
duties and representation at the Arab League Central Boycott 
Office meetings in Damascus once the requested meeting is 
scheduled. 
 
-- The SAG at the highest levels addresses all instances of 
attempted boycott enforcement and takes this responsibility 
seriously.  The Minister of Commerce and Industry has asked 
to be personally informed of any infringements and committed 
to take corrective steps to address any issues. 
 
-- Ambassador Smith and Emboffs have reached out to high- and 
working-level SAG officials in the past year and have 
received positive responses across the board.
