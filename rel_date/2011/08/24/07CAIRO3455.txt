 ¶1. (SBU) In a December 9 conversation with us, Barbara 
Ibrahim (wife of Egyptian-American democracy activist Saad 
Eddin Ibrahim (SEI)), noted that her husband is now facing 
twenty separate lawsuits, most of them charging him with 
"spreading false news," espionage, and attempting to harm 
Egypt's economy by calling for cuts in U.S. assistance to 
Egypt.  She commented that SEI feels that "the idea is to 
keep him busy and out of the country."  With regard to the 
libel case against SEI and the Ibn Khaldun Center (IKC), 
filed by Tagammu Party leader Rifaat Said (ref B), Ibrahim 
said that SEI's lawyer "feels confident" that the case can be 
resolved in an out of court settlement.  The lawyer recently 
counter-sued Said for libel, citing "insulting comments" he 
had made about SEI on a satellite TV show.  Said's lawyer and 
SEI's lawyer are due to meet before the Eid al Adha holiday 
(which begins December 19) to discuss a possible out of court 
settlement, or more formal arbitration, which would also 
occur out of court. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  With regard to the other nineteen lawsuits, Ibrahim 
noted that the hearings of the various cases keep being 
postponed, "mostly at the request of the prosecution."  One 
such case was scheduled for December 7, but then postponed 
until January 17.  This new case is reportedly against both 
SEI and IKC, and recommends that the government assume 
administration of IKC, in part because it allegedly received 
$40 million in USG funding.  (Note: Per ref C, IKC received 
USD 550,000 in MEPI funding this year for political education 
and electoral rights activities, and is currently engaged in 
a USD 100,000 two-year Grassroots Democracy and Islam program 
with USAID.  End note).  Ibrahim said that it would be 
helpful, both for this case and others, if SEI's lawyer had a 
document from the USG detailing precisely how much funding 
IKC has received from the US.  We are currently preparing a 
brief letter along these lines, to pass to Ibrahim.
