¶1.  (U) EconPolCouns and Pol Unit Chief delivered reftel 
demarche on February 28 to Thomas Hajnoczi, the MFA's 
assistant secretary-equivalent Director for Political 
Military Affairs, and Robert Zischg, MFA Deputy Director for 
Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation. 
 
¶2.  (U) Hajnoczi and Zischg said Austria had a great interest 
in the NATO trust fund to destroy Ukrainian munitions. 
Hajnoczi said Austria had participated in leading a trust 
fund, and appreciated what went into the effort.  Hajnoczi 
said someone from the Austrian Embassy in Brussels would 
certainly attend the March 11 meeting. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hajnoczi said he would have to look into the 
question of funding support -- "that depends on our Finance 
Ministry," he added.  Hajnoczi said he had fought hard to 
carve out a small line item to permit the arms control 
section to designate funds for certain activities.  Zischg 
said the Austrians had obligated these funds to the Balkans 
and "one or two African countries."  They would require 
additional authorities to contribute to the trust fund for 
Ukraine.
