¶1. (SBU) Summary: On February 11, a low-explosive, hand-made 
bomb exploded outside the Ternate residence of the head of the 
North Maluku High Court.  There were no reports of injuries. 
Although no group has claimed responsibility, the bomb was 
reportedly an attempt to put pressure on local officials 
responsible for a recount in the disputed gubernatorial 
election.  While demonstrations to date have been peaceful, 
local observers are concerned that protests could turn 
"chaotic."  Also on February 11, in Jakarta, the "chairman" of 
the North Maluku Election Commission was arrested after 
announcing incumbent governor Thaib Armyn had won the recount. 
End Summary. 
 
Low-Explosive Bombs in Ternate 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) According to press reports, a low-explosive, home-made 
bomb exploded in front of the garage at the official residence 
of Kamaruddin Kurip, the head of the North Maluku High Court, 
early on Monday, February 11, 2008.  There were no reports of 
injuries; two nearby cars suffered minimal damage.  Kurip and 
his wife were reportedly in Jakarta at the time of the 
explosion.  A similar bomb was discovered in front of the North 
Maluku Governor's office, but did not explode.   The police and 
Indonesian military (TNI) are conducting an investigation into 
the incident.   There have been no claims of responsibility 
 
¶3. (SBU) A North Maluku police contact told ConGen Surabaya that 
police are continuing to investigate the incident to identify 
the perpetrator and the motive.  They believe that both bombs 
were meant as a threat from those parties disappointed by recent 
court decisions on the disputed North Maluku gubernatorial 
election.  As of 1530 local time February 12, Ternate is calm. 
The North Maluku police are preparing for a series of 
demonstrations in coming days protesting Jakarta's involvement 
in North Maluku's election. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Local academic and media contacts told ConGen Surabaya 
that both incidents were an attempt to put pressure on Kurip, 
who is the senior provincial judicial official charged with 
implementing the January 23, 2008, Supreme Court ruling, which 
determined that the North Maluku Election Commission (KPUD) -- 
not the National Election Commission -- had jurisdiction to 
decide the winner of gubernatorial election (Surabaya 14).  More 
than 100 followers of Abdul Gafur, whose victory had been 
nullified by the Supreme Court's decision, had peacefully 
demonstrated in front of the Governor's Office on February 11 to 
protest the announcement by the KPUD that incumbent Thaib Armyn 
won.  Local observers expressed concern that similar 
demonstrations could easily become "chaotic." 
 
Meanwhile, in Jakarta... 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Alwi Sagaf, Director of "Diahi" radio station in 
Ternate, told us that the people of North Maluku are tired of 
the prolonged dispute. Neither candidate enjoyed much popular 
support. He explained that Thaib Armyn's performance as governor 
had been poor, while Abdul Gafur was perceived as an old-time 
Golkar party functionary.  Alwi added that he had heard from 
sources within the Governor's office that acting Governor Timbul 
Sugianti had discovered many financial irregularities associated 
with Thaib's administration. 
 
¶6. (U) According to press reports, Jakarta police arrested Rahmi 
Husien, the "non-active" chairman of the North Maluku KPUD, 
immediately after he announced the results of the KPUD's recount 
on February 11.  He was reportedly accused of illegal activity 
and giving false testimony during the election dispute trial. 
Abdul Hafis Anshari, the chairman on the National Election 
Commission, told reporters that the KPUD's recount was 
illegitimate because Rahmi Husien was no longer an "active" 
member of the KPUD.  In addition, the local election monitoring 
body (panwasda) did not attend the recount.
