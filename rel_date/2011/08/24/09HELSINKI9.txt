¶1. (SBU) PolOff discussed the Iranian candidacy for UNDP 
President with Marko Laine, Counselor, Unit for Development 
Issues (UNDP Desk for Finland).  He plans to discuss the 
candidacy further with the political section at the Finnish 
MFA, but noted that their unofficial position will be to vote 
in favor of the candidacy; they acknowledge US concern but 
based on the UNICEF experience with Iran in a leadership 
role, do not foresee Iran politicizing this venue. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Laine also stated that they hope this would not go 
to secret ballot as that is unprecedented.  He also commented 
that Iran has no special status in the UN at this time that 
provides a formal reason to block them; such as boycott or 
security resolutions.  Laine noted that UNDP connotes only 
"mild" political action and addresses strictly social 
development. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Government of Finland (GoF) does not yet have the EU 
official position on the vote.  The EU is expected to 
coordinate its position today or tomorrow morning and the GoF 
prefers to join a unified EU position.
