DELAY IN COURT HEARING 
 
REF: JAKARTA 1768 AND PREVIOUS 
 
 ¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Legal proceedings were originally scheduled to 
begin in the Central Jakarta District Court on September 17 
in the avian-influenza lawsuit against the USG and the World 
Health Organization (refs).  On advice by the Foreign Affairs 
Department (DEPLU), neither the USG nor its agent appeared at 
the September 17 proceedings.  Because the plaintiff did not 
attend the proceedings, the hearing was canceled until 
October 10 and then postponed again until October 17. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On October 17, DCM spoke with Arif Havas Oegroseno, 
Director of DEPLU's Office of Political, Legal and Regional 
Treaties.  Oegroseno said the court was divided on how to 
proceed in the lawsuit.  Some judges believed the case should 
be dismissed without a hearing on the basis of the 
plaintiff's lack of interest as well as sovereign immunity 
grounds.  Others, who were not yet persuaded by a sovereign 
immunity argument, said the suit should not be dismissed 
without a hearing.  The internal debate led the court to 
further postpone a decision regarding the proceedings until 
perhaps mid-December. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Oegroseno, who has been helpful throughout this 
process, recommended to the DCM that the USG not press for 
action from the court and await the mid-December decision.
