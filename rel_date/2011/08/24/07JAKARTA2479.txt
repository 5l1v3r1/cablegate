¶1. (U) The Government of Indonesia's (GOI) initial effort to explain 
the International Ship and Port Security (ISPS) code and a possible 
Port Security Advisory (PSA) (ref A) met with negative response from 
the media and Parliament.  Director General of Sea Transportation 
(DG) H. Harijogi, met with the Indonesian Ship Owners Association 
(INSA) on September 3 to inform them of the ISPS Demarche and 
potential PSA.  Initial media response quoted the Chairman of INSA, 
Oentoro Suryo, as saying, "The US Coast Guard will ask the 
International Maritime Organization to ban Indonesian ships from 
using International Seaports and Lanes," and that the U.S. is 
calling for a general boycott of Indonesian Seaports.  His interview 
appeared in three large Indonesian dailies.  Member of Parliament 
Yoseph Hadi stated the threat of a U.S. ports boycott is potentially 
more damaging than the European Union blacklist of Indonesian 
airlines on June 26 and he wondered if, "This is a campaign to 
tarnish Indonesia's image". 
 
¶2. (U) In response to the INSA Chairman's statements, the Ministry 
of Transportation called a press conference on September 5 to 
clarify the ISPS/PSA issue.  Another DGST official,  Director Djony 
Algemar said that Indonesia will reduce the number of international 
seaports from 141 to 25 and named the five facilities previously 
visited by the Coast Guard that are not ISPS compliant (ref A). 
Transportation Minister Jusman stated that a failure to reorganize 
(implement ISPS) within the 90-day time period will not lead to an 
automatic boycott, but the U.S. will tighten security controls on 
ships leaving from non-ISPS compliant ports.  Director General 
Harijogi also said that, "The U.S. Coast Guard has the right to 
inspect the harbors of U.S. trading partners to see if they meet 
ISPS standards". 
 
¶3. (U) Several observers also commented on Indonesia's past and 
future role in port security.  Member of Parliament Nai Soy said 
that, "The boycott threat was due to the fact that Indonesia often 
ignores regulations in the ISPS code".  An editorial in Media 
Indonesia stated the need for greater engagement by the government 
to correct deficiencies: "Truly this nation will be crushed by the 
era if we must wait for foreigners to speak before making efforts 
for improvement".  Media coverage after the DGST press conference 
more accurately reflects the ISPS Demarche and the current 
situation.  We will continue to monitor press reports as we get 
closer to the end of the 90 days before a PSA (November 22).
