REF: A. STATE 7674 
 
     ¶B. STATE 7676 
 
¶1.  Embassy Baghdad does not have information indicating that 
it would be inadvisable to give loans to the Rasun Company or 
the Sarqala Company.  Please note that IRMO/Private Sector 
did not suggest the project with the Rasun Company, as stated 
in ref B. 
 
¶2.  Evidence suggests that the northern Iraq poultry 
producers lobbied the Kurdistan Regional Government to cease 
issuing import licenses for poultry products.  Post believes 
this hinders US poultry exports to Iraq.  However, supporting 
this growing industry should result in a significant 
demand-increase in feed materials, and thus provide more 
opportunities for US grain suppliers to meet this demand.
