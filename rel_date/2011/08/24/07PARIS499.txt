SHOWCASING THE AMERICAN-FRENCH RELATIONSHIP 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  France 3, a regional state television channel, will send a team 
led by Serge Guynier, anchor for France 3's Aquitaine news shows, 
who has extensive experience in the U.S. and speaks fluent English. 
He will be assisted by Thierry Julien and Jean Marc Ceccaldi.  They 
will focus on the following stories, which will be shown as part of 
France 3's upcoming "America Week" in the late summer. 
 
-- Bordeaux/Los Angeles sister cities relationship, highlighting the 
fact that Bordeaux was the first city in the world to host a U.S. 
Consulate. 
 
-- The relationship between the Aquitaine, home to France's 
"high-tech" industries, and Silicon Valley, including ties between 
the laser research conducted at Livermore and the laser "Megajoule 
du Barp." 
 
-- Parallels between the wine country of Bordeaux and California.  A 
spotlight on Caudalie, its famous skin-care products based on grapes 
and their export to the U.S. 
 
-- French fashion in Los Angeles. 
 
-- The restaurant business, French cuisine in America, the "French 
touch." 
 
-- The surfing industry, including the image of Aquitaine as the 
"California of Europe" and an exploration of what that entails. 
 
-- Aquitaine natives playing in the National Basketball Association 
(Boris Diaw, the Pietrus brothers, etc.). 
 
-- We would also suggest adding a "green California" component on 
all the measures California (and the U.S.) are taking to encourage 
environmental responsibility. 
 
¶2.  These programs, focused on the links between France and the U.S. 
using local examples from the Bordeaux region and California, have 
full Post support.  Embassy Paris will coordinate with APP Bordeaux 
to create additional French media attention showcasing this "America 
Week" programming in advance of it airing in late summer.
