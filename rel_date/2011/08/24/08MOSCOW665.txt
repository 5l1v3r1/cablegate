SUBJECT:  DETAINED YABLOKO LEADER'S CASE RAISED 
 
REF: ST PETERSBURG 39 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On March 7, we raised our strong concern over the 
detention of St. Petersburg Yabloko leader Maksim Reznik with the 
Ombudsman's office and the Presidential Council on Human Rights. 
Ombudsman Secretariat Chief Natalia Mirza noted that she had yet to 
see the open letter sent to HR Ombudsman Lukin by prominent human 
rights activists, but that the office would take up Reznik's case if 
petitioned by Reznik's family, lawyer, or party.  (Note:  As a 
founder of Yabloko, HR Ombudsman Lukin will be disposed to resolving 
Reznik's case, but equally alive to the need to operate within his 
legal guidelines.)  Presidential Council Deputy William Smirnov told 
us that the Commission was aware of Reznik's case and was currently 
"considering" it. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In a separate conversation, Moscow Helsinki Chairperson 
Ludmilla Alekseeva stressed that Reznick's detention was political 
and clearly an "ordered affair," but said she could not speculate on 
whether this was an instance of local zealousness or federal 
direction.  Alekseeva led the list of approximately 30 human rights 
and political activists, who signed an open letter to General 
Procurator Chaika and HR Ombudsman Lukin, urging Rezniki's immediate 
release and rejecting the charges as fabricated.  The signators 
termed the detention a gross violation of the criminal code. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment:   Reznik's treatment has generated a strong 
public reaction here, as evidenced by the open letter.  We will 
continue to raise our concerns with GOR officials, and urge that 
Washington doubletrack with the Russian Embassy.  At this stage, we 
do not believe that a public statement will further Reznik's cause. 
The GOR will face additional scrutiny over the election and its 
aftermath when it greets Chancellor Merkel on March 8.
