SUBJECT: ASSEMBLY REGAINS QUORUM; ELECTION LAW NEGLECTED 
 
REF: KABUL 1147 
 
¶1. (SBU) The National Assembly's lower house regained quorum 
May 11 after Speaker Qanooni forced an end to the non-Pashtun 
MPs' boycott over the elections law bill's reservation of 10 
parliamentary seats for Kochis (REFTEL).  Qanooni redoubled 
his efforts to end the boycott when public sentiment turned 
against the lower house because of its failure to consider 
the politically important civil servants law bill.  Several 
of Qanooni's previous attempts to corral striking MPs had 
failed when one or both two sides reneged on reconciliation 
agreements, due to pressure, his staff told us, "from 
outsiders."  Prior to a May 10 reconciliation meeting, 
Qanooni ordered MPs to surrender their cell phones before 
locking the members inside a conference room to force a deal. 
 Six hours later, the group agreed to return the elections 
law bill, along with its controversial Kochi seats 
reservation, to committee.  The group also agreed to 
discipline Alam Gul Kochi, whose April 12 insults of 
non-Pashtun MPs had sparked their walkout.  Before releasing 
the MPs, Qanooni had them sign a document attesting to their 
agreement. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Since resuming its plenipotentiary sessions, the 
lower house has focused exclusively on the civil servants law 
bill, neglecting the elections law.  We are continuing to 
register with the Speaker's office our strong interest in the 
elections law bill's passage.  The lower house recesses June 
4 and returns July 21.
