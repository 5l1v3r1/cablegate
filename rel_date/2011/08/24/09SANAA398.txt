REF: STATE 18282 
 
PolOff delivered reftel talking points on March 2 to Ahmed 
Saif al-Kadasi, Director of the United Nations Office at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  Kadasi said that the 
USG's decision to participate in the UN's Human Rights 
Council (HRC) was a welcome step forward, because the U.S. is 
the "most important country in the world for human rights." 
Kadasi also expressed the ROYG's willingness to vote for the 
U.S. should it choose to run for a seat on the HRC. He was 
not familiar with the upcoming Durban Review Conference in 
Geneva, and accepted the talking points on the USG's decision 
to discontinue negotiating on the draft outcome document 
without comment.
