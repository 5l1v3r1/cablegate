Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please Protect Accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Cairo has been working with the Criminal 
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Egyptian 
Ministry of Justice, and the Regional Representative of the 
U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime to support a Regional 
Conference on International Cooperation in Judicial and 
Criminal Matters, to be hosted by Egypt in Cairo on March 8-9. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Conference, originally proposed by Egypt during 
bilateral judicial consultations in January 2005, is intended 
to bring together key working-level judicial officials from 
countries throughout the region to promote assistance in 
legal and criminal matters between and among participating 
countries.  The program will particularly stress the 
importance of establishing and maintaining a central 
authority to handle international legal cooperation requests. 
 Currently, this concept is underdeveloped in a number of 
regional states. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A USD 14,000 grant from the Embassy's 632 (a) small 
grants program has been issued in support of the conference. 
The grant will be used to support the participation of 
outside experts in international legal cooperation, to fund 
translation services, and other logistical support for the 
conference.  (USDOJ also intends to send a small delegation 
to participate.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Egypt intends to issue in early January invitations 
to all Arab League member states to send two representatives 
involved in policy making and coordination in the fields of 
mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.  Participating 
countries will be expected to bear the expenses of their 
delegations. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Egyptian MOJ contacts noted that some invited 
countries (they mentioned Yemen and Morocco) may have 
difficulty financing their delegations' participation. 
Certain NEA posts may wish to consider facilitating host 
country participation, through MEPI grants or other USG 
funding sources, in this rule of law strengthening activity.
