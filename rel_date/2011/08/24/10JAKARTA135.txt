VISIT/COMPREHENSIVE PARTNERSHIP PRIORITIES 
 
This message is Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
¶1. (U) This message contains an Action Request.  Please see 
paragraph 14. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 29, Ambassador Hume and Deputy Chief of 
Mission Ted Osius met with Director General for Europe and 
the Americas Retno Marsudi at the Department of Foreign 
Affairs (DEPLU) to review U.S. and GOI priorities for the 
President's anticipated 20-22 March visit to Indonesia. 
 
¶3. (SBU) NATIONAL CEMETERY WREATH-LAYING: Retno stated that 
the National Heroes' Cemetery is usually visited by incoming 
dignitaries, especially during State visits.  She said that 
it was very important to the Indonesian government and 
public, and noted it would take less than 30 minutes. 
 
¶4. (SBU) SPEECH: Retno asked if a speech at the National 
Monument would be advisable, adding that from the perspective 
of the GOI, it was too risky in terms of security and control 
to have it in "the open."  Retno said use of Senayan Stadium 
or Parliament would afford the GOI more control over the 
crowd and potential demonstrators. 
 
¶5. (SBU) SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENT: Retno said the 
agreement needed "extra effort to bring the positions 
closer."  She said she would raise this issue further within 
the GOI in advance of the 22-24 February discussions in DC. 
 
¶6. (SBU) LAND PURCHASE: Regarding the pending land purchase 
for the new Embassy construction, Retno suggested the 
Ambassador raise it to the Foreign Minister's level given 
that the issue appeared stalled. 
 
¶7. (SBU) MILITARY-TO-MILITARY NORMALIZATION: Retno said 
resolution of the U.S. military training of Indonesian Army 
Special Forces (KOPASSUS) was a very important issue for 
President SBY. 
 
¶8. (SBU) CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH and 
OPIC: Ambassador Hume said a U.S. delegation would arrive 
February 8 to discuss the planned health center.  Retno said 
she had blocked her calendar February 7 through March 22 to 
prepare for the visit. 
 
¶9. (SBU) YOGYAKARTA:  Retno said that President SBY might 
decide to accompany President Obama on a trip to Yogyakarta. 
 
¶10. (SBU) YOGYAKARTA LOCOMOTIVE REPAIR PLANT:  Retno agreed 
that a proposed visit to the Yogyakarta site would reinforce 
the cooperative message sent by highlighting the sale of U.S. 
locomotives to Indonesia and the resulting U.S. and 
Indonesian jobs generated by the sales. 
 
¶11. (SBU)  INTERFAITH: Retno asked whether the White House 
planned to include an interfaith event, suggesting that a 
brief meeting with a small number of religious leaders would 
be positively received by the Indonesian people. 
 
¶12. (SBU) AFGHANISTAN: Ambassador Hume noted that he would 
meet with the head of the Indonesian National Police on 
February 1 to discuss whether the GOI would commit to 
training Afghan National Police. 
 
¶13. (SBU) COMPREHENSIVE PARTNERSHIP:  Retno said she 
envisioned two documents coming out of the visit.  First, a 
brief Presidential Joint Statement that would focus on a 
long-term vision of the U.S. - GOI bilateral relationship. 
Second, a declaration and a plan of action that would launch 
the Comprehensive Partnership. 
 
¶14. (SBU) Retno asked whether the USG had completed a 
counterdraft to the GOI's October 2009 draft text.  She also 
asked Ambassador Hume whether the USG could provide a sample 
of a one-page Joint Statement.  ACTION REQUEST: Per Retno's 
request, Mission would welcome any sample statements from 
other visits.  So that EAP can succeed in its February 11-12 
negotiations, post recommends sending well in advance a text 
of the Plan of Action.  The GOI will hold an interagency 
meeting February 2 to discuss the Comprehensive Partnership. 
 END ACTION REQUEST.
