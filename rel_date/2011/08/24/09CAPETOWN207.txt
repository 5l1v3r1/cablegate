SUBJECT: EASTERN CAPE ANC PROVINCIAL CONFERENCE 
 
¶1. (U)   On September 12 the African National Congress (ANC) 
concluded its sixth Eastern Cape Provincial conference by voting for 
the new Eastern Cape Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) and 
Chairperson.  A total of 1963 delegates were accorded a voting 
status at the conference despite earlier glitches that led to delays 
in the start of the conference and the election process. 
 
¶2. (U) The leadership race was closely contested between Finance MEC 
Mcebisi Jonas, regarded as the favorite to win, and Health MEC 
Phumulo Masualle.  In a surprise turn of events Masualle beat Jonas 
with just 100 votes to claim the leadership in the Province.  Jonas 
commanded support from the two biggest regions, Amathole and OR 
Tambo municipalities, as well as the ANC Youth and Veteran's 
Leagues, while Masualle, who is also the South African Communist 
Party (SACP) national treasurer, had backing mainly from the smaller 
regions.  It was, however, the decision by rural development 
Minister Gugile Nkwinti to throw his weight behind Masualle that 
swayed the vote and saw Masualle's lead rise to 100, enough to 
clinch the leadership.  Comment: It is interesting to note that 
Masualle was an avid Zuma supporter at the Polokwane conference 
which ousted Mbeki.  Although Jonas is also a Zuma man, his close 
association with another Polokwane contender, businessman Tokyo 
Sexwale, now the human settlements minister, has cast doubt on his 
dedication to Zuma and appears to have ultimately cost him the 
Provincial Chairmanship. End Comment. 
 
¶3. (U) The run-up to the conference saw a vicious lobbying campaign 
for the leadership that resulted in some meetings turning into 
street fights as rival groups, armed with firearms and knives 
attacked each other. The situation became so nasty that Luthuli 
House had to dispatch a high-profile delegation, including Tony 
Yengeni and Jessie Duarte, to address more than 400 delegates from 
the Amathole region in Butterworth prior to the conference. It, 
however, appears that the friction within the Province has not been 
eased as supporters of the new provincial chairperson soon lobbied 
to have Eastern Cape Premier, Noxolo Kiviet removed. A special 
resolution was passed by the conference calling for Masualle to lead 
the Province, all that remains before it is implemented is for the 
new PEC to enforce it. If Masualle becomes Premier he could order a 
council reshuffle and appoint new MEC's. 
¶4. (SBU) Comment.  Although the Eastern Cape is traditionally an ANC 
stronghold it has in recent years seen political infighting, 
corruption and nepotism amongst its own ranks leading to the near 
collapse of municipalities and the provincial administration in the 
Province. It has an appalling record of service delivery, a matter 
that could have been discussed at the conference. However, due to 
disputes over accreditation the start of the conference was delayed 
leading to inadequate discussions on organizational renewal. A 
provincial general council will now have to be organized to debate 
policy issues, given that there was no time for the planned 
breakaway sessions at the conference. End comment.
