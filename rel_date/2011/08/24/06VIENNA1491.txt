This message is Sensitive but Unclassified. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Government of Austria, in its capacity as 
President of the European Union, issued a declaration on May 
22 welcoming the formation of the new Iraqi government.  The 
Austrian EU Presidency said it saw the process as the 
completion of the political transition in Iraq. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Text of the declaration follows: 
 
The European Union warmly welcomes the formation of an Iraqi 
government of national unity following the elections of 15 
December 2005. This completes the political transition 
process in Iraq, as foreseen in United Nations Security 
Council Resolutions 1546 and 1637. 
The European Union firmly believes that the formation of this 
government of national unity and a swift subsequent 
confirmation of the ministers of interior and defence will 
contribute significantly to the political and economic 
reconstruction of Iraq in a spirit of reconciliation by 
promoting inclusiveness and anti-sectarian policies. This 
will represent another important step towards national 
consensus and will contribute to the stabilisation of the 
country and its further integration into the international 
community. 
The European Union conveys to the newly formed government its 
best wishes for success in view of the challenges ahead. The 
European Union reaffirms its commitment to assist in building 
an independent, secure, stable, unified, democratic and 
prosperous Iraq.
