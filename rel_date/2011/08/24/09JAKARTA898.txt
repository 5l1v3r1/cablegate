SUBJECT:  Science, Environment, and Diplomacy at the World Ocean 
Conference 
 
¶1. Summary:  U.S. participation in the World Ocean Conference, 
including Secretary Clinton's taped address, demonstrated how the 
U.S. can play a constructive role in understanding the link between 
oceans and climate change.  Indonesia has a growing international 
role on environmental issues, and the U.S. worked together well with 
it to guarantee the conference's success.  The U.S. delegation 
included non-governmental actors and earned significant 
international media coverage for the conference and the role the 
United States played.  We can build on this smart power success by 
concluding a bilateral Science and Technology Agreement before 
President Obama's possible November visit; sending NOAA's Okeanos 
Explorer research vessel in 2010; and developing a global science 
corps.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. The U.S. delegation, headed by Department of Commerce Deputy 
Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere Mary Glackin, her team 
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and 
professionals from USAID and the Bureau for Oceans, Environment and 
Science (OES), was the largest at the conference.  It played a 
central role in negotiating a conference declaration highlighting 
oceans as a central element of the climate change debate.  Local 
press commented on the delegation's positive role in forming 
consensus on key issues. 
 
Respect for Indonesia's Growing Role 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. As host of the December 2007 UN Climate Change talks, founder of 
the Coral Triangle Initiative and convener of the first World Ocean 
Conference, Indonesia is playing a bigger part internationally on 
environmental issues.  D/US Glackin's participation and the 
Secretary's recorded remarks showed U.S. respect for Indonesia's 
increasingly active role on climate change and marine conservation. 
The delegation's effectiveness was enhanced by the close partnership 
in Indonesia between State and NOAA, the nation's lead ocean and 
atmosphere agency. 
 
Google, Scripps, Smithsonian - Non-traditional U.S. Partners 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4. The official delegation was strengthened by non-governmental 
actors.  Two eminent scientists participated: the Director of 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Smithsonian Institution 
Marine Science Chair.  The Chief Technology Advocate from Google 
also joined the U.S. delegation.  Google may have new opportunities 
to partner with Indonesia.  Minister of Maritime Affairs and 
Fisheries Freddy Numberi seeks Google's help to map Indonesia's 
17,000 islands.  Google needs Indonesia's help to improve its 
imagery of Indonesia in Google Earth (many parts of the country are 
obscured in clouds). 
 
Public Diplomacy Outreach 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. Key international media outlets, including CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera, 
Deutche Welle, AP, AFP and the Financial Times, all carried stories 
on the U.S. role in the conference.  Local media also ran daily 
stories about U.S. participation.  On the conference margins, 
delegation members interacted with high school and university 
students through environmental movie screenings, national photo 
competitions, and university talks by leading U.S. scientists. 
 
What's Next? 
------------ 
 
¶6. The combination of science, environment, and diplomacy 
contributed to the success of the World Ocean Conference and 
strengthened our partnership with Indonesia on science and 
technology issues.  Embassy Jakarta will pursue three initiatives to 
further build this partnership.  We want to conclude a bilateral 
Science and Technology Agreement before a possible November visit by 
President Obama to provide a framework for cooperation in additional 
fields.  We will also work with NOAA to bring its premier ocean 
research vessel Okeanos Explorer to Indonesia in 2010 to deepen ties 
on maritime research.  And we will explore the possibility of 
becoming a pilot country for a new global science corps.
