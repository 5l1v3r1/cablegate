SUBJECT:  PRM A/S SAUERBREY VISIT TO TURKEY:  CONTINUED QUICK 
PROCESSING OF IRAQI REFUGEES 
 
¶1. Summary: In an August 22-24 visit to Turkey, PRM Bureau Assistant 
Secretary Ellen Sauerbrey expressed thanks to Government of Turkey 
 
SIPDIS 
counterparts for their cooperation in issuing exit permission to 
in-country Iraqi refugees being resettled to the United States, and 
requested that this cooperation continue in the coming months. 
Government of Turkey interlocutors indicated that the cooperation 
will continue, but voiced concern that news of large numbers of 
Iraqis leaving for the U.S. from Turkey could attract additional 
Iraqi asylum-seekers into their country. 
End summary. 
 
GOT Calls Cordial 
----------------- 
 
¶2. A/S Sauerbrey met with Sertac Sonmezay, the Deputy Director 
General of the Migration, Asylum and Property Office at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs.  She expressed appreciation to the GOT for being 
a generous host to Iraqis needing temporary asylum, and for their 
fast-tracking the issuance of exit permits.  Sonmezay remarked that 
this is the first time in recent history the GOT has agreed to 
process such a large number of refugees in such a short time. 
 
¶3. He continued by repeating a key concern of the Turkish government 
about Turkey becoming a magnet for additional Iraqi refugees seeking 
a quick way to the west.  Sonmezay observed that an Iraqi refugee in 
Turkey has a much higher percentage chance of resettlement to 
western countries than Iraqi refugees in other countries in the 
region.  He expressed particular concern about Iraqis currently in 
Syria crossing into Turkey. The A/S responded that the USG does not 
support or encourage secondary movement to Turkey. 
 
Message to Interior Ministry: No quotas 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  A/S Sauerbrey made two calls on top officials with the Turkish 
National Police (TNP), which is responsible for issuing exit 
permits, and which falls under the Ministry of Interior.  During her 
meeting with Oguz Kagan Koksal, Director General of the TNP, she 
dispelled the prevailing belief that the U.S. has a quota system 
that governs refugee admissions. She indicated that the U.S. would 
be willing to accept for resettlement as many of the Iraqi refugees 
in Turkey as possible. She also emphasized that when conditions in 
Iraq further stabilize, the USG would be happy to see these same 
refugees returning to help build their country.  In an additional 
meeting, she met with Kadir Ay, Acting Director of Foreigners, 
Border and Asylum Department, who provided firm assurances of 
continued cooperation. 
 
NGOs poised for action 
---------------------- 
¶5. A/S Sauerbrey visited International Catholic Migration Commission 
(ICMC) offices in Istanbul and observed a pre-screening interview 
with an Iraqi applicant family.  In addition, she dropped in on a 
pre-departure cultural orientation session. ICMC staff briefed her 
on the time line of processing refugees and the multiple steps 
involved. 
 
¶6.  In Ankara, the assistant secretary met with representatives of 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and 
International Organization for Migration (IOM). UNHCR country 
representative Ana Liria Franch indicated they are registering 
approximately 100 new Iraqis a week; some quite newly arrived, 
others who have been in Turkey studying or working.  UNHCR indicated 
that there are refugees coming forward that they are not submitting 
because they have come into Turkey from Syria and Jordan.  UNHCR is 
carefully holding to a commitment it has made to the GOT to not 
handle secondary movement cases. 
 
¶7.  At the IOM, Director Maurizio Busatti reiterated his 
organization's readiness to play a continuing role in the 
resettlement effort.  They have been particularly involved in 
arranging travel for the refugees.  Busatti observed that he has 
heard concerns from the MFA that refugee inflow is an ingredient for 
instability.  The challenge to NGOs, he said, is to convince Turkey 
that the nominal number of refugees in-country do not pose a threat 
to Turkey's stability.  Busatti does fear, however, that the Turks 
are approaching the "enough is enough" stage. 
 
Seeing Off the Refugees 
----------------------- 
¶8. The A/S spent 25 minutes with a group of refugees, mostly 
Chaldean Christians, departing for the U.S. from Istanbul airport on 
August 22.  After speaking with the group as a whole, she shook 
hands with each refugee and heard anecdotes from each family group. 
A spokesperson from the group expressed gratitude to the Turkish 
government for their hospitality.  The A/S reminded the refugees 
that while we hope they thrive in the U.S., the goal was for them to 
be able to return to a stable, peaceful and democratic Iraq. 
 
¶9.  A/S Sauerbrey did not have an opportunity to clear this message 
before traveling.
