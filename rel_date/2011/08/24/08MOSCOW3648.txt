SUBJECT: DELIVERY OF DRAFT MOU AND IA BETWEEN DHS AND

DETECTION COOPERATION 
 
REF: STATE 125153 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On December 9, ESToff delivered the reftel draft 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Implementing Agreement 
(IA) between the Department of Homeland Security and the 
Russian Academy of Sciences in English and Russian to Oleg 
Rozhkov, Deputy Director of the MFA Department of Security 
and Disarmament Affairs (DVBR) and Head of the North America 
Desk, Igor Neverov.  On December 11, ESToff fielded questions 
from North American Desk Officer Aleksey Ivanov regarding the 
rationale for sending the MOU and IA to them.  ESToff 
clarified that this was for the North America Desk's 
information and action as appropriate to ensure there would 
be no problems in moving forward.  On December 12, ESToff 
discussed the MOU and IA with First Secretary Olga 
Kuznetsova, Nuclear Affairs Officer in DVBR.  She said she 
had not had time to read the MOU and IA in detail, but from 
what she had read she thought it was a valuable project.  She 
went on to say that the MFA role in this would be as a 
monitor only and that they would pass another copy 
"officially" to the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS). 
"After that," she said, "it will be strictly between the two" 
(the DHS and RAS) to work through any issues. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On December 10, EST Counselor delivered demarche 
and a copy to Academician Nikolay Laverov at the RAS.  He and 
senior RAS official, Boris Myasoyedov, reviewed the documents 
briefly and said that they were already in discussions with 
the U.S. side and looked forward to working together on this 
project.  Laverov indicated that he would be traveling to the 
U.S. in February 2009 and hoped that it might be ready for 
signature at that time. 
 
¶3.  (U) T Senior Advisor Tim Katsapis has cleared this 
message.
