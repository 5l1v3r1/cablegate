SUBJECT: WHEN ONE UNAMID DEPLOYMENT DOOR OPENS, ANOTHER CLOSES 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Deployment "progress" made during the June 5 
United Nations Security Council visit to El Fasher, North Darfur, 
appears to be illusory, according to United Nations-African Union 
Mission in Darfur Force Commander GEN Agwai.  While the Government 
of Sudan promised to allow Thai and Nepalese elements to deploy 
following the Ethiopian and Egyptian elements, it now seems that the 
Government of Ethiopia is imposing its own preconditions to 
deployment of its battalion, prompting a June 13 visit by GEN Agwai 
and new Planning Chief Noddy Stafford to Addis Ababa to re-negotiate 
with the Ethiopian Ministry of Defense.  On the basis of this and 
other logistical impediments, Agwai remains pessimistic that any 
significant UNAMID deployment will occur before spring 2009.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
ETHIOPIA ONCE AGAIN ON THE FENCE 
-------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) In a June 8 meeting with FieldOff, United Nations-African 
Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) Force Commander GEN Martin Luther 
Agwai discussed the June 5 visit by the United Nations Security 
Council delegation (UNSC) to Sudan, including its meeting with 
Presidential Advisor Nafie Ali Nafie.  According to GEN Agwai, 
UNAMID Joint Special Representative Rodolphe Adada advised the UNSC 
to raise UNAMID deployment as the number one priority when it met 
with Nafie.  Agwai said he understood that during the course of this 
meeting, Nafie said that after the first Ethiopian and Egyptian 
battalions deploy, the Government of Sudan (GoS) will accept the 
Thai and Nepalese elements. 
 
¶3. (SBU) However, on the same day that the UNSC visited El Fasher 
(June 5), the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) sent a Note Verbale to 
UNAMID saying it would deploy its battalion to Sector North first, 
then later re-locate it to Sector West.  This contradicts a prior 
arrangement between the GoE and UNAMID, in which the Ethiopians 
would deploy to Kulbus in Sector West, according to Agwai's 
priorities.  GEN Agwai said he and the new Chief of Planning Noddy 
Stafford (who replaced COL Murdo Urquhart; Urquhart departs Sudan on 
June 19 but is in El Fasher at the moment) will travel to Addis 
Ababa on June 13 to discuss this revised deployment plan with the 
Ethiopian Ministry of Defense. 
 
OBSTACLES NEW AND OLD PERSIST 
----------------------------- 
¶4. (U) Both GEN Agwai and COL Urquhart, in separate conversations 
with FieldOff, expressed concern that too much time has passed 
between when Thailand and Nepal made their initial UNAMID pledges 
and the GoS' acceptance of these elements, and that the Thai and 
Nepalese Governments likely will have to be re-approached for these 
units.  COL Urquhart reported that he had been told last week by a 
Nepalese commander, who had been on the original UNAMID 
reconnaissance last fall, that the Special Forces unit pledged then 
has since been committed elsewhere.  GEN Agwai confessed he was not 
surprised by such news and expected that Thailand has done the same. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) GEN Agwai reiterated concerns about issues that continue to 
plague UNAMID deployment, including lack of land in Kulbus, which 
would prevent the Ethiopian battalion from eventually deploying 
there.  He said UNAMID is pushing hard for land in Um Kadada, Kulbus 
and Korma required for Ethiopian and Rwandan deployments.  He added 
that Tine and Um Barru have yet to be expanded to accommodate 
Senegalese elements and troop increases to the 800-man level.  "If 
there is no expansion," Agwai reminded, "then we cannot plus-up to 
800 and Formed Police Units cannot deploy." 
 
¶6. (SBU) COL Urquhart told FieldOff that his biggest concern for 
UNAMID is the July 14 departure of PAE, the contractor responsible 
for building transit camps and super-camps, which could serve as 
"placeholders" for incoming forces while new camps are being built 
and existing camps expanded by commercial contractors [NOTE: Acting 
Chief of Integrated Support Services Wolfgang Weiszegger told 
FieldOff on June 8 that while PAE is in reality not doing much for 
incoming troops, the commercial contractors on whom UNAMID would be 
forced to rely for camp expansion are not impressive.  END NOTE]. 
 
¶7. (SBU) In addition to the problems associated with expanding 
existing camps and building new ones, GEN Agwai reiterated the need 
to find a faster way to transport contingent-owned equipment from El 
Obeid into Darfur.  He pointed out that it will take the Nepalese 90 
days from their eventual deployment date to the date they receive 
their equipment, since they only order their equipment on the day 
they receive final deployment authorization.  Finally, GEN Agwai 
noted he is discussing with UN Headquarters in New York which 
battalions would not enter the mission, since current pledges exceed 
UNAMID's mandated troop ceiling.  Given these factors, as well as 
the advent of the rainy season in Darfur (July and August, when 
Agwai predicted UNAMID would "stand still"), Agwai did not expect 
UNAMID to be stood up in any viable way before spring 2009.
