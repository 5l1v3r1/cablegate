REF: SECSTATE 69283 
 
 Â¶1. (U) On May 22, A/Polcouns met with proliferation expert 
Dionyssios Kivetos of the MFA D1 Directorate for 
International Organizations to discuss reftel invitation to 
the open-ended seminar on UNSCR 1737 and 1747 implementation. 
 Kivetos said no one from the MFA would be able to attend due 
to prior commitments during this heavy period of 
international meetings.  Kivetos noted, however, that a 
representative from the Greek missions in Vienna could 
perhaps attend, though a final decision had not yet been 
taken.
