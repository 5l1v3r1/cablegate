Â¶1.  Earlier today, in seemingly coordinated attacks, bombs 
exploded at public and foreign facilities in Bosaaso, 
Puntland and Hargeysa, Somaliland.  In Bosaaso, two Puntland 
Intelligence Service (PIS) facilites were hit. In Hargeysa, 
the Ethiopian mission, the UNDP office and the Somaliland 
Presidential compound were hit. The bombings appear to have 
been caused by vehicle-born devices. At this time, we are not 
aware that any group has claimed responsibility for the 
attacks. No AMCIT casualties have been reported.  Ethiopian 
President Meles confirmed to A/S Frazer in Nairobi (both are 
here for the IGAD conference on Somalia) that three Ethiopian 
officials at their mission in Hargeysa were killed.  Media 
reports indicate that some 22 have died and another 50 or so 
were wounded in Hargeysa; we understand the French military 
are medivac-ing some of the wounded to Djibouti. In Bosaaso, 
we can confirm 2 PIS officials dead and 7 wounded.
