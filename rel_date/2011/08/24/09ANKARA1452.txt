SUBJECT: TURKISH PARLIAMENT EXTENDS AUTHORITY FOR CROSS 
BORDER OPERATIONS IN IRAQ 
 
REF: ANKARA 01391 
 
¶1. (U) On October 6 the Turkish Parliament approved a 
one-year extension to perform cross border operations in 
Iraq.  Out of the 475 Ministers of Parliament who voted on 
the motion, 452 voted in favor. All twenty-one members of 
DTP, the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party. The one-year 
time line begins October 17. 
 
¶2.  (U) Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that,  "The 
government is determined to implement the Kurdish initiative 
package in the near future.  The extension of the 
Cross-Border Operation motion will contribute to these 
efforts.  We will maintain our multi-dimensional, diplomatic 
and military politics in order to eliminate the terror 
problem.  Our aim is to establish a sustainable security 
environment in which there will be no need for similar 
motions." 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  This approval was widely expected, but does not/not 
represent any change in policy nor does it signal 
preparations for the Turkish military to conduct a major 
cross-border strike.  Top-level support in the Turkish 
General Staff for the whole-of-government "Kurdish 
initiative" remains strong.
