¶1. (SBU) Summary: Incumbency has proved to be more of a 
millstone than an advantage for the once preeminent Golkar Party 
in a series of gubernatorial elections across Eastern Indonesia. 
 On July 7, West Nusa Tenggara witnessed the fifth and most 
recent defeat for an incumbent Governor, in this case supported 
by Golkar and the Indonesia Democratic Party of Struggle. 
Corruption in Governor Lalu Serinata's administration, a revolt 
in his own party and a popular challenger in cleric Zainul Majdi 
helped tip the balance.  The challenger was endorsed by the 
Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and the Crescent Start Party 
(PBB).  An anti-incumbent mood and strong support from Lombok's 
majority Muslim population were the keys to victory according to 
local sources. End Summary 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Golkar-supported incumbent lost the West Nusa 
Tenggara (NTB) Governor's race July 7 to a 36 year old cleric 
supported by two Islamic parties.  For the Golkar Party this 
brings the total of recent Golkar provincial losses to five: 
East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), West Java, South Sulawesi and North 
Maluku.  Rumored behind-the-scenes support from Vice President 
Jusuf Kalla allowed incumbent Lalu Serinata to run as Golkar's 
candidate, despite open revolt by local Golkar cadre.  Early 
returns show that challengers Zainul Majdi and Badrul Munir -- 
endorsed by the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and the Crescent 
Star Party (PBB) -- received 37 percent of the vote. The 
incumbent, Lalu Serinata and Husni Djibril -- supported by 
Golkar, Party of Democratic Struggle for Indonesia (PDIP), the 
Reform Star Party (PBR), and the Patriot Party -- came in second 
with 28.68 percent.  Systemic problems with administration of 
the election will be covered septel. 
 
Corruption Cost Golkar 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Chair of NTB's Indonesian Hindu Association, I 
Gusti Lanang Media, told Congen Surabaya that many Golkar cadres 
in NTB were lukewarm at best about nominating incumbent Lalu 
Serinata and his involvement in a well-publicized corruption 
case didn't help.  Lalu Serinata was brought in for questioning 
repeatedly by provincial as well as national prosecutors 
regarding his alleged involvement in embezzling Rp 25 billion 
(USD 2.7 million) while he was chairman of NTB Parliament from 
2001-2003.  Days after being chosen as Golkar's candidate for 
reelection, he was summoned by the National Prosecutor's office 
for questioning in the case.  Vice President Jusuf  Kalla (also 
Chairman of National Golkar) reportedly did not waver in his 
support for Lalu Serinata, despite local opinion and the clouds 
gathering over the governor's mansion.  Mr. Nasihudin, Personal 
Secretary to the Governor-elect, told Congen Surabaya that 
National Golkar in Jakarta had transferred Rp. 10 billion (USD 1 
million) to NTB Golkar three days prior to election. 
 
Local Culture Was Decisive 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Prosperous Justice and Crescent Star Parties 
married their strategy to local culture.  Their nomination of 
Muhammad Zainul Majdi, a charismatic young cleric from a famous 
Islamic boarding school, represented hope for change in the 
province.  According to local media and Congen Surabaya sources, 
this approach was in sharp contrast to the business-as-usual 
style adopted by Golkar.  Majdi's PKS and PBB supporters made 
use of the existing leadership role held by Majdi as a teacher 
or Tuan Guru in Lombok.  Mr. Nasihudin told Congen Surabaya that 
Majdi prevailed because of voter disgust with corruption coupled 
with a deep respect for Majdi as a Tuan Guru capable of setting 
things right.  Seen from a political perspective, by visiting 
rural villages and giving public sermons on moral issues over 
the course of the past 10 years, Majdi had built up a wide base 
of support and developed name recognition and popularity 
throughout NTB's villages.  According to Nasihudin, Governor 
Lalu Serinata rarely visited the villages and when he did he was 
escorted by policemen and bodyguards.
