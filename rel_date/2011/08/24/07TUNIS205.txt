Begin Text: 
 
Tunis, Feb. 8 (TAP) - The foreign ministry, on Thursday, made 
public the following communique: 
 
"Tunisia is following with deep concern the excavations and 
demolition works carried out by Israel near the holy mosque 
of Al Aqsa, which works are aimed at distorting the 
architecture of this sacred historical monument and harming 
its Islamic identity. 
 
Tunisia considers that these works represent a provocation to 
the feelings of the Islamic nation and are likely to further 
stir up tension in the region and undermine the international 
and regional efforts aimed at reviving the peace process. 
 
While reiterating its constant position of support to the 
Palestinian cause and expressing its conviction of the 
peoples' rights to preserve and glorify their sacred 
religious symbols, Tunisia condemns these repeated violations 
and urges the international community to exert pressure on 
the Israeli government so that it would put an immediate end 
to the excavation and demolition works carried out near the 
holy Al Quds."
