REF: 06 STATE 124445 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel demarche, Minister of Interior 
Robert Kalinak informed Ambassador on April 13 that the GOS 
is willing to resettle two Cuban families, up to a total of 
eight individuals, from the protected population at 
Guantanamo.  The GOS requests that Director General McKinley 
of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) send a 
letter to Minister Kalinak requesting Slovakia's help in 
resettling the migrants. The GOS will then coordinate the 
details with IOM, including sending an official to Guantanamo 
to meet the prospective migrants. The GOS does not want 
publicity for the resettlement. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Slovakia has a small Cuban community in Bratislava. 
The GOS will help the two Cuban families transition to life 
in Bratislava by finding apartments for them, arranging 
Slovak language lessons, and providing other services.
