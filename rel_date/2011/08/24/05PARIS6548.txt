SUBJECT:  USUNESCO:  INDIA EXPRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT 
REOPENING THE CONVENTION 
 
 
¶1. In her statement today at the Executive Board on the 
Canadian draft decision to move the cultural diversity 
convention forward, the Indian Ambassador stated her 
concerns about reopening the convention.  In her statement, 
she said, "The Draft Convention, which has gone through an 
extensive intergovernmental process represents a delicate 
balance of interests.  This includes article 20 of the draft 
convention. To reopen the discussions could unravel this 
balance and result in a draft that does not represent this 
balance." 
 
¶2.  Comment:  The word "balance" in her statement means 
offsetting, contradictory statements.  Her major concern is 
that reopening negotiations on the convention will lead to a 
clearer but worse document, including the possibility of 
losing paragraph two in article 20. India has been able to 
so ardently support the convention because of the document's 
inherent inconsistencies.
