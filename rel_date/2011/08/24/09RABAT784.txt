SUBJECT: MOROCCO POSTPONES GICNT RESOLUTION INTRODUCTION 
 
REF: A. A. RABAT 715 
     ¶B. B. RABAT 709 
 
¶1. (SBU) Moroccan MFA Director for United Nations and 
International Organizations told D/PolCouns on September 16 
that Morocco will not seek to introduce the GICNT resolution 
during the upcoming UNGA session (ref a), but would wait 
until next year.  Citing other, more immediate priorities 
(CTBT Article XIV Conference, April 2010 Nuclear Security 
Summit), Farhane stated that Morocco is unable to run the 
resolution at this time, but offered that one of the other 
co-sponsors could take the lead this year, if they wanted to 
(ref b).  He reiterated GOM support for the GICNT. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Elaborating on GOM GICNT efforts, Farhane noted that 
the outreach meeting with African nations, originally planned 
for late-2009, would be delayed until early-2010.
