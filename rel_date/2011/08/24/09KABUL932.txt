SUBJECT:  DEPUTY SECRETARY LEW, UN SRSG DISCUSS DONOR 
COORDINATION, ELECTIONS, AND RECONCILIATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  On April 4, 2009, the Deputy 
Secretary of State for Management and Resources, 
Jacob Lew and delegation met with Ambassador Kai 
Eide, Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
for Afghanistan (SRSG), United Nations Assistance 
Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA).  The discussion 
focused on coordination (both within the 
international donor community and within the 
government), the upcoming elections, and 
reconciliation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
DONOR COORDINATION & AID EFFECTIVENESS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The Deputy Secretary welcomed UNAMAQs growing 
role in donor coordination.  The SRSG acknowledged 
that a comprehensive inventory of international 
assistance, and how the various efforts fit together, 
is noticeably absent.  The SRSG indicated that the 
World Bank Management Information System database 
assessmentQs (to track the Afghanistan National 
Development StrategyQs [ANDS] progress) first draft 
was complex and needed to be re-written in a more- 
user-friendly way.  The SRSG hopes to share the draft 
with the GIRoA and the broader donor community soon. 
 
¶3. (U) The SRSG also noted that data on international 
assistance (primarily external to the national 
budget) is incomplete.  While USAID provides data to 
the Ministry of Finance and UNAMA, the CommanderQs 
Emergency Response Program (CERP) funds are not 
currently captured.  Michael Yates, USAID/Afghanistan 
Director, indicated that USAID is working with the 
U.S. military to develop a database to track all USG- 
funded projects, and all parties agreed to encourage 
other donors to report on who is doing what and 
where.  The SRSG remarked that this would be a huge 
step forward to improve coordination. 
 
------------------ 
GIRoA COORDINATION 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) The SRSG highlighted that ANDS 
implementation progress needs greater GIRoA 
engagement. The GIRoA must get on with the job of 
prioritizing and implementing its many ANDS policy 
commitments. 
 
¶5. (U) The next Joint Coordination Management Board 
(JCMB) is scheduled for April 19 and will focus on 
agriculture, private sector development, ANDS 
financing and implementation issues, and police 
staffing and reform. 
 
--------- 
ELECTIONS 
--------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The SRSG suggested that more money for the 
elections may be needed.  The SRSG noted that Japan 
made a contribution of $11.5 million and that the 
European Commission will allocate $45.9 million (an 
increase from $19.7 million the prior year).  The SRSG 
noted that UNAMA has been shifting support to staff up 
its election unit.  James Bever, USAID Afghanistan- 
Pakistan Task Force Director, expressed concerns over 
potential hidden election costs.  For example, during 
the 2004 Presidential elections, Afghanistan National 
Police per diem costs amounted to an additional $35-40 
million. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Deputy Secretary expressed concern about 
 
KABUL 00000932  002 OF 003 
 
 
U.S. military presence and visibility in support of 
the elections; election security support should be 
Afghan military-led.  An EU exploratory mission will 
travel to Afghanistan mid-April to review election 
security, and a meeting with UNAMAQs DSRSG Chris 
Alexander is on their agenda.  The Deputy Secretary 
highlighted that the EU must petition NATO for an 
expanded ISAF mandate that includes security support 
for international observers.  The Deputy Secretary 
also requested that the SRSG provide a map of 
elections security needs, suggesting that other 
countries could increase their support for election 
security, including in insecure areas. 
 
¶8.  (U) The SRSG noted that the Electoral Complaints 
Commission (ECC) will hear and review complaints 
during the period of candidacy and elections 
(including run-offs if necessary) and will be 
present in every province.  An ECC in every district 
was deemed unfeasible.  These offices are also 
likely to require additional resources for security. 
 
¶9.  (U) The SRSG recommended more radio spots vs. TV 
spots to increase media coverage, as the majority of 
the population currently lacks access to TV.  During 
his recent visit to Kabul, Ambassador Carney raised 
this issue. The SRSG is planning to meet with key 
media owners regarding elections. 
 
-------------- 
RECONCILIATION 
-------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) The SRSG briefly raised the issue of 
reconciliation with moderate Taliban. As 
reconciliation is contained within their mandate, 
the SRSG requested that the reconciliation process 
be conducted in an open fashion, with a role for 
everyone to play.  The Deputy Secretary noted that 
it would be dangerous to accept the preconditions of 
the hardcore Taliban, and that the reconciliation 
process will be extremely challenging. The Deputy 
Secretary did not clear this cable.
