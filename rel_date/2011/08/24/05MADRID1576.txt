SUBJECT: SPAIN: DEMARCHE ON COMMUNITY OF DEMOCRACIES 
ELECTION STANDARDS INITIATIVE 
 
REF: STATE 71941 
 
Poloff discussed Secretary Rice's concept paper, "Developing 
Election Standards and Assessment Mechanisms for the 
Community of Democracies," with Carlos Fernandez-Arias, 
Special Assistant to Rafael Dezcallar, MFA Director General 
for Foreign Policy, on April 21.  Poloff told Fernandez-Arias 
that the Election Standards Initiative was a priority of 
Secretary Rice and that the USG was seeking support for the 
 
SIPDIS 
idea and approval for a working group on the proposal at the 
Community of Democracies Ministerial in Santiago April 28-30. 
Poloff asked Fernandez-Arias to make Dezcallar and Foreign 
Minister Moratinos aware of Secretary Rice's desire for 
Spain's support.  Fernandez-Arias said Spain was interested 
in the proposal and he would circulate the paper within the 
MFA and to senior leadership.  Fernandez-Arias also asked 
Poloff if the U.S. had made a statement regarding the recent 
crisis in Ecuador.  Poloff sent Fernandez-Arias information 
from the "Washington File" that included statements by 
Secretary Rice and the White House on the current situation 
 
SIPDIS 
in Ecuador.  We will continue to pursue this matter with MFA 
leadership.
