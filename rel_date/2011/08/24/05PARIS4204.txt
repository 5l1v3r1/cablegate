NOMINATING-OFFICER: Marie-Cecile Henard 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Helene Moraut-Pestanes is in charge of communication in the 
French Food Safety Agency - AFSSA.  Thanks to her technical 
and regulatory expertise in food safety, nutrition, 
biotechnology, international farm policies and environment, 
she is the person explaining complex and technical AFSSA 
recommendations and reports to the press and the public.  She 
is therefore a key-person to educate about the U.S. regulatory 
framework on risk assessment and communication on risk in the 
farm and food sector.  With her professional expertise in 
organic and biotechnology, learning about these sectors in the 
United States would help her understand the technical and 
economical feasibility of their coexistence.  Biotech and non- 
biotech coexistence is currently the key-issue in France and 
other European Union Member States, as it is not regulated at 
the European level. 
For Helene Moraut-Pestanes and AFSSA, building contacts in the 
United States with agencies in charge of risk evaluation and 
communication on risk in food safety, nutrition, organic and 
biotechnology would be helpful to improve consumer education 
and adjust the information provided to consumers to their 
demands and fears.  She could contribute to change French 
consumer perception of biotech products in food.
