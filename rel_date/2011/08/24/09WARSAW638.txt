REF: STATE 62265 
 
(SBU) Poland agrees with the U.S. that the UN Comprehensive 
Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) should not 
weaken the existing "sectoral" conventions on terrorism, 
according to Robert Drzazga, head of the International Law 
Division of the MFA's Legal Department.  In response to 
reftel points on June 19, Drzazga said Poland agreed that 
standard military carve-out language should be retained in 
the text, emphasizing that Poland's position is in line with 
EU views.  Drzazga said he would forward the points to 
Poland's Mission to the UN, but did not anticipate that the 
upcoming meetings would make any real progress on this 
stalled convention.
