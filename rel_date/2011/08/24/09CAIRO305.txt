REVIEW 
 
REF: SECSTATE 4730 
 
¶1. (U) This cable responds to Ref A seeking answers to the 
two questions posed by the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative regarding Telecommunications trade agreements 
pursuant to section 1377 of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988.  The questions focused on market 
access and transparency for satellite services (SIA). 
 
¶2.  (U) VSAT Operator Licenses:  Egypt does not restrict the 
number of licenses available for VSAT operators and satellite 
service operators.  Currently, there are four companies that 
have VSAT licenses: Alkan, Mobiserve, Egypt Sat, and Africa 
Wave.  Only one company of the four, Alkan, is doing well in 
the market and has a lion market share.  The licenses are 
provided based on market demand.  The restriction on licenses 
is a result of market saturation. 
 
¶3.  (U) Transparency and Petitioning:  Egyptian telecom 
licensees should inform the National Telecommunications 
Regulatory Authority (NTRA) in order to obtain access to 
and/or contract directly with a foreign satellite operator. 
Users should go through an Egyptian licensee.  A foreign 
operator may provide its service to end users through an 
Egyptian licensee.  The NTRA provides details on its website 
on the VSAT regulation, at the following address:
