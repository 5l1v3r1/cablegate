Attack against AMIS convoy in North Darfur 
 
Today, 19 August 2006, at 08:50 a.m., an African Union Mission in 
Sudan (AMIS) fuel convoy traveling from El Nahud to El Fasher was 
ambushed in the Kuma area by an unidentified group of armed men. 
Two AMIS soldiers were killed in the attack and three have been 
wounded. 
 
The African Union Mission in Sudan condemns in the strongest 
possible terms this outrageous attack against its forces in Darfur 
and intends to carry a thorough investigation to identify the 
perpetrators of this despicable attack and will hold the leaders of 
those groups found responsible personally accountable. 
 
This unprovoked ambush against AMIS peacekeepers is also a clear 
breach of the ceasefire agreements, with which all parties are bound 
to comply, as well as the relevant AU PSC and UNSC resolutions.  The 
African Union wishes to remind all parties that such violations will 
not be tolerated under any circumstances. 
 
The African Union extends its deepest sympathies to the families of 
the soldiers killed and injured and assures the people of Darfur 
that such attacks will not deter AMIS from maintaining its 
neutrality and assisting the Sudanese to achieve peace and security 
in the beleaguered region of Darfur.
