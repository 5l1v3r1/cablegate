Â¶1.  Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El 
Heraldo" on 11/8, entitled "Another Challenge in Iraq." 
"While President George W. Bush and his followers are 
enjoying his indisputable win, the occupation forces in Iraq 
have a difficult task at hand: conquering the rebel Sunni 
city of Fallujah through blood and fire after having failed 
for the past seven months." 
 
"The problem is that, as usually happens to occupation 
forces, time is becoming their worst enemy, both because of 
their inability to ensure safety - which is shameful for the 
greatest power in history - and the fact that it would be a 
terrible failure for the U.S. if the elections scheduled for 
January can't be carried out.  The elections in Iraq are a 
good thing for the Americans, even though they're merely a 
farce, just as in Afghanistan." 
 
"We hope that, in the end, after so much death, pain, and 
destruction this senseless occupation has caused, the Iraqis 
themselves come out triumphant to reclaim their right to 
live in peace and under the government they choose in 
legitimately free elections."
