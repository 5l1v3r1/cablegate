¶1. Summary: This cable responds to the directive in 
paragraph 5 of Reftel.  No/no further reports of human or 
animal cases of AI have been made since Ref B.  CDC's 
Central Asia Region representatives are continuing their 
informal, but fruitful cooperation with Kazakhstani 
authorities.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  Since the end of all quarantine periods, no further 
evidence of a new AI outbreak has been discovered or 
reported in Kazakhstan.  However, GOK efforts to improve 
surveillance and preparedness continue, and the GOK has 
consulted informally with CDC as it continues to refine its 
policy. 
 
¶3.  Specifically, the Ministry of Health has agreed in 
principle to continued consultation with CDC on improving 
its AI surveillance infrastructure.  Additionally, senior 
health officials have asked for CDC's opinion on such 
subjects as vaccinating at-risk human populations with human 
influenza vaccine and the usefulness of stockpiling anti- 
viral medications such as Tamiflu.  CDC has shared its 
impressions from those consultations with WHO and the World 
Bank. 
 
¶4.  Results are expected soon in an epidemiological 
investigation conducted into the suspected human case in 
Golubovka village (Pavlodar oblast, Ref C).  The 
investigation involved tests of sera collected from 146 
human subjects, including poultry farm workers and people 
believed to have been in contact with the then-suspected 
human AI victim.  The investigation included antibody tests 
of the sera to exclude any theoretically possible sub- 
clinical (i.e. asymptomatic) cases of AI. 
 
¶5.  Minimize for Dushanbe considered.
