SUBJECT:  GOZ ACCEPTS 18,000MT OF MAIZE FROM THE US 
 
 
¶1.  (U) On July 25, 2002, USAID met with the Minister of 
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare, Mr. July Moyo, 
and with Mr. Lancester Museka, the Permanent Secretary, 
regarding the US humanitarian assistance program. 
 
¶2.  (U) During his July 21-24, 2002 visit to Zimbabwe, 
Mr. Roger Winter, USAID's Assistant Administrator, Bureau for 
Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance, offered 
approximately 18,000 MT of maize to the Government of 
Zimbabwe (GOZ) for distribution by the World Food Program 
(WFP).  The maize is scheduled to arrive in the region 
before the end of the month. 
 
¶3. (U) In a letter detailing this offer, Mr. Winter asked 
the GOZ to provide assurance that the food would be received and 
distributed promptly, with any necessary biotech/GMO waivers. 
In the July 25 meeting, the Minister agreed to accept the offer 
of maize and confirmed that the GOZ will pay and arrange for 
immediate milling of the maize.  He indicated that we should 
expect to receive an official letter to this effect within the 
next twenty-four (24) hours, after which he suggested that we 
schedule a meeting with his ministry and WFP to work out the 
detailed logistics for importation and distribution.
