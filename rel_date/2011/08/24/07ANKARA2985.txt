In Today's Papers 
 
Turkish Warplanes Attack PKK Bases 
All papers report that Turkish F-4 and F-16 fighter jets attacked 
four PKK bases in northern Iraq.  According to a statement posted on 
the  Turkish General Staff (TGS) website early Sunday, the air 
strike lasted approximately three hours, followed by four hours of 
long-range artillery shelling. Mainstream Hurriyet reports that 
Turkish warplanes destroyed several PKK camps and eight 
anti-aircraft batteries in the Kandil Mountains, Zap, Avasin and 
Hakurk.  Tabloid Aksam writes that Turkish fighter jets flew as far 
as 100 kilometers into Iraq.  Hurriyet writes that "the US opened 
Iraqi air space and turned off the electrical instruments used to 
jam Iranian air communications" in order for Turkey to complete its 
mission.   Mainstream Milliyet reports that TGS officials deny 
claims that Iran also took part in shelling PKK targets.  Papers 
carry an announcement from the northern Iraqi Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK) that the PKK "suffered heavy losses in the strikes." 
However, other Iraqi authorities claim one woman was killed and 140 
families fled their homes.  Mainstream Vatan and the 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak speculate that top PKK leaders Murat 
Karayilan and Bahoz Erdal might have been killed in the strikes. 
Mainstream Sabah quotes an unidentified Turkish officer as saying 
that the destruction of some "75-80 percent of the PKK command has 
triggered a process of psychological collapse in the PKK."  Papers 
also say that Iraq delivered a diplomatic note to Turkey concerning 
the assessment of civilian damage.  Papers emphasize that it was 
"not a note of protest." 
 
The chief of the TGS, General Yasar Buyukanit, told Kanal D on 
Sunday, "I can categorically state that not a single civilian 
target, not a single village was hit.  Only previously identified 
PKK camps were hit.  There is no question of any accident." 
Buyukanit also said, "by opening Iraqi airspace to us last night, 
America gave its approval to the operation," Papers also report US 
Embassy Spokesperson Kathy Schalow's comments that "we have not 
approved any decision, it is not for us to approve.  We were, 
however, informed before the event." 
 
Prime Minister Erdogan said the operation was very successful and 
congratulated the pilots and other military personnel who carried it 
out.  "We will continue to wage this battle, both inside and outside 
Turkey, for our nation's unity and peace," Erdogan said.  Government 
Spokesman Cemil Cicek, too, congratulated the military for the 
success of the operations, and called on PKK members to surrender. 
The DTP, Turkey's main Kurdish party, said that violence will not 
resolve the Kurdish problem. 
 
Papers also quote US State Department official Chase Beamer that the 
Turkish air operation was Ankara's decision.  He also said 
Washington respects Turkey's right to defend itself and that the 
target of the operation was the PKK, not the civilian villages in 
northern Iraq. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkish Air Attacks on the PKK in Northern 
Iraq 
 
Murat Yetkin commented in the liberal-intellectual daily Radikal: 
"Due to harsh weather conditions and the debate over the 'returning 
home' legislation, the PKK surprised by this weekend's air strikes. 
Turkey engaged in midnight air strikes after the US cleared Iraqi 
air space.  This kind of international cooperation demonstrates a 
serious show of force.  This operation's psychological effects 
outshine its military results.  With this operation, we see the 
fruits of Turkish-American cooperation.   This operation would not 
be possible without the efforts of the United States.  The US, who 
controls Iraqi airspace, approved this operation.  This weekend's 
developments indicate that the November 5th Bush-Erdogan meeting 
marked a turning point for implementing political and military 
dialogue.  The likely next step will be Ankara's recognition of the 
 
ANKARA 00002985  002 OF 002 
 
 
Kurdish Federation. As Chief of General Staff Buyukanit recently 
said, Turkey would consider a modern federation in Iraq "rather 
preferable."  We may see cooperation emerge between the US, Iraq and 
Iraqi Kurdish administration." 
 
Washington-based Ali Aslan commented in the Islamist leaning daily 
Zaman: "Two points were cleared during the November 5th Bush-Erdogan 
meeting:  The US will provide intelligence and will turn a blind eye 
to Turkey's use of this intelligence in its limited military 
operations.  In return, Turkey will not engage in large scale ground 
operations into northern Iraq and will not target civilians.  Also, 
the US asked Turkey to look for ways to reach a political 
settlement, to which Turkey agreed.  This strike was possible 
because of this agreement between Turkey and the US. The Turkish 
government, on the other hand, is working on plans for a 
comprehensive amnesty.  In addition, Ankara has expressed its desire 
to engage with northern Iraqi leaders more, which also can be 
considered as an effort toward a more political and diplomatic 
solution." 
 
Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in the conservative daily Turkiye: "According to 
initial reports, the air strike included 50 planes and demonstrated 
Turkey's military power.  No country in the Middle East, except 
Israel, has such a technical capacity.  This operation carries 
political importance because the US provided intelligence and 
clearance to use Iraqi airspace, which is practically American soil. 
 With this air strike, we have witnessed an exemplary harmonious 
relationship." 
 
Priest Stabbed in Izmir 
All papers report that Italian Roman Catholic priest Adriano 
Franchini was stabbed Sunday at his church in Izmir.  Franchini 
sustained non-life-threatening stab wounds to his stomach, was taken 
to the hospital, treated and released.  Police detained Ramazan Bay, 
a 19-year-old suspect from the nearby city of Balikesir, who 
attacked the priest following the mass.  Liberal Radikal reports 
that the assailant allegedly said he was influenced by the popular 
Turkish series "The Valley of the Wolves," which touched on 
Christian missionary activities in Turkey.
