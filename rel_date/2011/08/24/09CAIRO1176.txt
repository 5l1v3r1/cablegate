¶1. (SBU) Key Points 
 
-- On June 18, 2009, the GoE signed an agreement with the Australian 
firm WorleyParsons to provide consultancy to help develop Egypt's 
first nuclear power plant. 
 
-- Bechtel had been engaged in months of negotiations with the GOE, 
but ultimately Bechtel's tender offer to provide consultancy was 
excluded by the Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MoEE) on April 
29, 2009. 
 
-- Though Worley is an Australian firm, it has major U.S. operations 
and we expect significant U.S. content in the new plant. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On June 18, 2009, WorleyParsons Ltd. signed a contract with 
the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity and Energy for the development 
of Egypt's first Nuclear power plant. Ambassador Scobey, Australian 
Ambassador Stephanie Shwabsky, and Egyptian Prime Minister Dr. Ahmed 
Nazif were present at the signing along with Worley's President, Ron 
McNeilly and Dr. Rames Khalil, Worley's Regional Power Manager for 
Egypt and Africa. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Khalil told us he expects significant U.S. content in the 
project, including U.S. engineers employed to build local capacity 
and transfer technology to the Egyptian side. WorleyParsons plans to 
bring nuclear engineers from the United States (where they have 
1,500 engineers) and Bulgaria to work with and instruct their 
Egyptian counterparts.  In addition to the United States, Russia, 
France, and China have indicated interest in becoming involved in 
the nuclear project. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: The Ambassador attended the signing ceremony in 
order to convey USG support for Egypt's civil nuclear power program 
and for the expected U.S. component in the upcoming project. With 
over 40% of its assets based in the United States, WorleyParsons has 
a large U.S. presence.  The company employs more than 1,500 American 
employees in 24 offices in the United States.  Despite 
disappointments surrounding Bechtel's failed negotiations, now that 
WorleyParsons has completed tender negotiations and signed the 
agreement with the GOE, we consider this a closed deal and will 
support U.S. inclusion in Egypt's nuclear power program as much as 
possible through this agreement. End Comment. 
 
¶5. (SBU) BACKGROUND: In December 2008, the Egyptian Nuclear Power 
Plants Authority (NPPA), part of the Ministry of Electricity and 
Energy, awarded Bechtel Power Corporation a 10-year contract worth 
$188 million to consult on and help design Egypt's first nuclear 
power plant (reftel A). A committee formed from different government 
agencies selected Bechtel over seven other corporations. However, 
during the negotiation phase, one of the main points of contention 
between Bechtel and the GOE was the issue of nuclear insurance 
liability. After many delays, this issue was eventually resolved by 
Bechtel agreeing to NPPA's requests. 
 
¶6. (SBU) On April 29, Bechtel received a letter from the NPPA 
stating that their proposal was not compliant with the tender 
document and was therefore excluded (reftel B). On May 1, the 
Australian firm WorleyParsons began contract negotiations with NPPA 
to provide consulting services to help build Egypt's nuclear power 
plant. 
 
¶7. (U) WorleyParsons Limited is Australia's largest engineering firm 
and is also one of the world's largest engineering design firms. 
Formed in the 2004 merger between Parsons E&C and Worley 
Engineering, the company has designed, constructed, or managed the 
construction of more than 250 gas processing plants, 600 chemical 
and petrochemical facilities, and 370 power plants worldwide. 
WorleyParsons is traded on the Australian stock exchange and over 
40% of the company is made up of U.S. assets.  The company has a 
market capitalization of greater than $3.1 billion.  WorleyParsons 
has 114 offices globally including 24 in the U.S. and a U.S. 
headquarters in Houston. It employs 31,700 people including 6,000 in 
the United States.
