Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam lead with news of continued Iranian protests 
against the results of recent presidential elections.  Al-Ayyam runs 
separate front page coverage citing AFP of comments by President 
Obama in an interview with CNBC on June 16 noting that the 
difference between the policies of the two lead presidential 
candidates is not great and either winning will mean that the U.S. 
will have to deal with a hostile Iranian regime. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with news citing wafa and Reuters about 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas' meeting with Middle East 
Quartet Envoy Blair in Ramallah on June 16.  In the meeting, Abbas 
stated that he believes that peace and coexistence with Israel will 
ultimately be achieved.  Abbas briefed Blair on Israeli restrictions 
that hinder the development of the Palestinian economy, especially 
crossing point closures and checkpoints in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Blair assured Abbas that the Middle East Quartet remains committed 
to the development of the Palestinian economy, according to coverage 
that appears on all front pages. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page cites DPA in reporting that EU Foreign 
Ministers on June 15 condemned Israeli settlement activity in the 
Palestinian Territories, including "natural growth," calling it 
"illegitimate."  The ministers called on Israel to immediately halt 
all settlement activity, according to coverage. 
 
Al-Quds' front page runs remarks by President Obama made during his 
joint press conference with Italian Premier Burlusconi about Israeli 
Premier Netanyahu's June 14 speech.  In related news, Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida's front page cites wires in reporting that Netanyahu 
intends to "pursue negotiations" with President Obama regarding 
settlement activity, especially natural growth. 
 
All dailies front page an announcement by the Palestinian Authority 
Minister of Health on June 16 that three cases of H1N1 have been 
reported in the Palestinian Territories.  Reporting mentions that 
the cases are Palestinian students just arriving from the U.S. 
without further detail.  The Ministry noted that the cases were 
contained, reporting concludes. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page coverage citing wafa on 180 U.S. 
organizations in more than 32 states submitting an appeal to 
President Obama on June 16 calling for a freeze or suspension of 
U.S. military support to Israel if Israel does not accept American 
policy initiatives (two-state solution), according to coverage. 
 
Al-Quds runs front page coverage of an exclusive interview with 
Hamas leader Zahhar noting that he believes that agreement can be 
reached among Palestinian factions to end internal division during 
July 7 talks in Cairo.  Zahhar also noted that Hamas will respect 
the results of any "transparent" Palestinian elections.  Zahhar 
praised President Obama's June 4 speech and reiterated that concrete 
steps are now needed.  Zahhar wondered whether Israeli and foreign 
lobbies in the U.S. will give Obama the chance to implement his 
vision for ending the Palestinian -Israeli conflict. 
 
All front pages run prominent photo and written coverage on former 
U.S. President Carter's visit to Gaza on June 16 and his meeting 
with the "Hamas government."  Al-Ayyam runs a front page photo of 
Carter and Hamas leader Hanniyah talking to the press.  Hanniyah 
confirmed Hamas openness to any peace settlement that is based on 
establishing a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders and stressed 
 
JERUSALEM 00001020  002 OF 002 
 
 
that Hamas and other factions support the truce with Israel. 
Hanniyah praised President Obama's June 4 speech and again noted 
that it has, "new language, a new tone and a new spirit."  For his 
part, Carter told press that he hoped to see Palestinian factions 
reconcile and pledged to share with President Obama, Secretary 
Clinton and Envoy Mitchell, all of what he saw in Gaza in terms of 
destruction resulting from the recent conflict in Gaza.  Carter 
underscored that the U.S. bears responsibility for the destruction, 
according to coverage. 
 
In economic news, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs inside coverage of USAID 
West Bank/Gaza Mission Director Sumka visiting USAID projects in 
Jenin district on June 16.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Hamadah Fara'nah opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "The ball is in the U.S. court"(06/17):" In his speech, 
Netanyahu tried to create middle ground between his ideology and the 
U.S. vision of halting settlements and acceptance of the two-state 
solution.  However, he neither accepted the Palestinian state nor 
approved of halting settlement activities.  The situation will 
remain unresolved with no concrete change on the ground and, of 
course, no negotiations... Obama has to face his responsibility 
before the international community and defend the credibility of his 
policies.  If he can't convince Netanyahu to pursue negotiations and 
recognize Palestinian rights, then at least he should stop providing 
shelter for Netanyahu's extremist beliefs." 
 
2) Khalid Al-Hroub opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "Ahmadinijad's victory doesn't serve the Palestinians" 
(06/17):  "I don't see any reason why Palestinians would celebrate 
Ahmadinijad's victory in recent Iranian elections.  This victory 
will harm the Palestinian cause and negatively reflect on 
Palestinians.  Having Nijad as the Iranian President for another 
four years means more marginalization  and isolation of Palestinians 
on the international and regional scenes."
