REF STATE 29419 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On Friday, April 3, ESToff presented and discussed the 
reftel points on steps toward entry into force of the Baikonur 
Technical Safeguards Agreement (TSA) with MFA Department for 
Security and Disarmament Affairs Outer Space Affairs Senior 
Counselor Georgiy Yurivich Barsegov.  Barsegov confirmed that the 
Russian government passed the diplomatic note regarding entry into 
force to the Kazakh government in 2004. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Barsegov stated that Russia had received a "clean and 
final" copy of the Kazakh language version of the TSA in March 2007 
along with a diplomatic note stating the Russian and English 
versions were in conformance with the Kazakh language version.  He 
said that Russia is simply waiting for the final diplomatic note 
from the Kazakh government in order to generate the required round 
of diplomatic notes bringing the TSA into force.  He noted that 
Russia sees no further changes to the document and commented that 
the delay by Kazakhstan in sending the required final note is 
"inexplicable" since all parties have compared the document in their 
respective languages and agree that it is in conformity.  Barsegov 
concurred with the entry-into-force path as laid out in the reftel. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Barsegov also stated that, in MFA's view, the 
"provisional" nature of the current arrangement is not of concern to 
the Russian government, as it sees any provisional status as "open 
ended" and not requiring an extension or further exchange of notes.
