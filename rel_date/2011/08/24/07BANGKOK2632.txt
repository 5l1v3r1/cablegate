     ¶B. STATE 51828 
 
¶1.  On May 9, Dr. Charn Jullamon, Director of the Peace, 
Security, and Disarmament Divisions at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) told poloff that the Royal Thai 
Government (RTG) was moving forward with preparations to 
participate in the Heavy Support Package for Darfur 
(reftels).  The Royal Thai Supreme Command (RTSC) notified 
MFA that Royal Thai Supreme Commander General Boonsrang 
Niumpradit had approved the deployment of 200 personnel to 
support the UN mission.  Charn said he did not know which 
specific units would be offered, but said that they would 
likely be RTA Engineers.  Charn said he would help coordinate 
as preparations moved forward. 
 
¶2.  While the Thai are seriously considering a deployment, 
there remains much work before they can actually send units 
to Darfur.  Post wishes to assist the Royal Thai military and 
Foreign Ministry with this possible deployment.  We 
anticipate Thai inquiries about possible U.S. logistics, 
transportation and administrative support and would 
appreciate any detailed information we can share with the 
Thai to make any deployment a success.
