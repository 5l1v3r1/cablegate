     ¶B. RABAT 1109 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  In response to Ref A request for an overview of 
Morocco's nuclear energy plans, Post notes Ref B reporting 
discussions held during the November 16-18 visit to Morocco 
of Ambassador Jackie Wolcott, the Secretary's Special Envoy 
for Nuclear Nonproliferation.  Ambassador Wolcott discussed 
Morocco's nuclear energy plans and preparations with the 
Minister of Energy, officials of Morocco's National 
Electricity Office (ONE), the Director of the National Center 
of Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Techniques (CNESTEN), and 
officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. 
 The Government of Morocco (GOM) believes that given 
Morocco's constraints (96 percent dependent on imported 
energy sources, with electricity consumption growing at 8 
percent per year), nuclear power is nearly inevitable as a 
solution to its energy needs.  For decades the Ministry of 
Energy and CNESTEN have been preparing the legal, regulatory 
and technical base that eventually will be required.  ONE 
believes that nuclear energy would be cost-competitive with 
other sources of electricity in the near future and is 
preparing to issue a request for proposals for a nuclear 
power plant to be built and operated as an independent power 
producer (IPP) with a guaranteed purchase contract. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Regarding specific Ref A questions, much of 
Morocco's legal and regulatory framework for nuclear issues 
is currently in flux.  Draft legislation dealing with nuclear 
technology and safety will (perhaps in 2009) revamp the 
decentralized regulatory responsibilities for matters 
involving nuclear materials and safety currently partitioned 
among the Ministries of Energy, Industry and Health, and will 
create a sole nuclear regulatory body.  Ultimately, decisions 
on proceeding with nuclear power plants will lie with a 
national council on nuclear energy consisting of the Prime 
Minister, and the Ministers of Energy, Health, Industry, 
Agriculture, and Environment (the current Minister of Energy 
is also Minister of Environment). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As noted in Ref B, other countries (notably France) 
have also engaged the Government of Morocco in discussions on 
nuclear energy with an eye to commercial advocacy, but as yet 
Morocco has signed no agreements.  Post recommends USTDA 
attention (such as an orientation visit to the U.S. of 
Moroccan officials) to ensure that any Moroccan decisions on 
civil nuclear energy benefit from exposure to U.S. 
technologies and suppliers.
