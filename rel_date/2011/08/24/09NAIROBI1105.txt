SOME TFG GAINS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  According to well-placed sources within and 
outside of the Somalia Transitional Federal Government (TFG), on and 
 
off fighting continues in Mogadishu between TFG forces, al-Shabaab 
and other extremists, with the TFG making some gains in western 
areas 
of the city.  A May 31 gain by the TFG in eastern Mogadishu was 
reversed on June 3, when al-Shabaab re-took the Yaqshiid District 
Police Station.  A reportedly large TFG force controls Beledweyne, 
the capital of Hiran Region, and the TFG is planning to use the 
force 
in the coming days to attempt to push al-Shabaab out of the Hiran 
towns of Buulobarde and Maxaas.  In addition, there are unconfirmed 
 
reports of deep divisions between al-Shabaab and Hisbul Islam 
leadership regarding the rationale for continued violence.  End 
summary.

Fighting in Mogadishu 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) There has been on and off fighting of varying intensity 
between TFG troops and al-Shabaab and other extremists in different 
 
areas of Mogadishu since May 31. In a May 31 offensive, TFG troops 
gained control of Yaqshiid District Police Station and its immediate 
 
surroundings in Eastern Mogadishu.  However, two days of counter- 
attacks by extremists caused the TFG troops to backslide and lose 
control of the police station midday on June 3.  Sources within the 
 
TFG told us a lack of timely supplies of ammunition and 
reinforcements forced their troops to retreat from the police 
station 
amid heavy pressure from extremists.  Yaqshiid District is 
predominantly Hawiye/Abgal/Waeysle territory, and initial TFG 
success 
in the area is partly attributed to the participation and support of 
 
members of this sub-sub-clan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Fighting also broke out in the far-western district of 
Dharkenley on June 2 after TFG troops attacked al-Shabaab positions 
 
in the area.  The fighting, which was reportedly fierce, saw al- 
Shabaab fighters lose control of the strategic Dharkenley Police 
Station to TFG troops.  Control of Dharkenley District and Hoosh 
neighborhood in particular, where most of the fighting was 
concentrated, will interrupt al-Shabaab reinforcement and supply 
routes from Lower Shabelle Region. 
 
¶4. (SBU) TFG military chief General Yusuf Hussein Osman "Dhuumaal" 
told us successive battle victories on these two fronts have boosted 
 
his troops' morale.  Non-TFG sources in Mogadishu have told us that 
 
TFG troops have maintained the upper hand in all the battle 
encounters and have gained significant ground. 
 
¶5. (SBU) General Dhuumaal told us his troops are facing serious 
communication and transportation constraints.  He requested 
communications equipment and pickup trucks to ease transportation 
needs. 
 
¶6. (SBU) After a botched offensive in early May in Bakara Market, 
TFG 
troops reportedly now avoid the market area for strategic reasons 
despite the presence of extremist fighters in the area.  There are 
reports that the TFG is liaising with the business community and 
militias present in the market to non-violently facilitate civilian 
 
use of the market, instead of conducting an offensive in the area, 
to 
avoid unnecessary loss of life and property.

¶7. (SBU) According to TFG Minister of Security Omar Hashi, there are 
 
many TFG troops in Hiran Region and the TFG is in full control of 
Beledweyne, the regional capital.  Hashi says the TFG plans to send 
 
troops to Buulobarde and Maxaas, both in Hiran Region, to expel al- 
Shabaab from those two towns in the coming days.  Hashi has been 
meeting with clan and sub-clan elders in Hiran Region discussing 
security in the region and support for the TFG.  Hashi says he does 
 
not expect fighting in Beledweyne because TFG troops have 
overwhelming force in the town and extremist forces fear him as 
Beledweyne is his home town and he commands much respect across all 
 
sub-clans.  Hashi plans to return to Mogadishu by road once he is 
done meeting with elders.

Divisions Among Al-Shabaab and Hisbul Islam 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) There are unconfirmed reports of deep divisions between 
al- 
Shabaab and Hisbul Islam leadership regarding the rationale for 
continued violence.  Khalif Farah, a keen observer of Mogadishu 
politics, told us that Hassan Dahir Aweys is frustrated as his 
expectation of a quick "knock out" victory against the TFG becomes 
more elusive each passing day.  In a recent meeting in Mogadishu, 
members of Aweys' Ayr sub-clan reiterated its confidence with and 
support for the TFG.
