SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWE FOOD SWAP AGREEMENT SIGNED 
 
REF: Memorandum of Understanding between 
 
Government of Zimbabwe Ministry of Public Service, 
Labour and Social Welfare and Grain Marketing Board 
with United Nations - World Food Programme executed 
on 16 September 2002 (copy faxed 9/29/02) 
 
¶1. This is to confirm that the ref. Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) for the long-planned swap of 
17,500 Metric Tons (MT) of U.S.-source whole kernel 
corn/maize donated to the World Food Program's Emergency 
Operation (EMOP) appeal for Zimbabwe with an equivalent 
amount of corn/maize from Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) 
stocks was finally signed by all concerned parties on 
27 September 2002. [Note:  The final document indicates 
that the GOZ's Ministry of Public Service, Labour and 
Social Welfare signed the MOU on 18 September 2002, 
confirming that the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and 
Rural Resettlement's parastatal Grain Marketing Board 
was, indeed, the long-standing obstacle to completing 
this agreement.  End Note.]  WFP sources indicate that 
the wheels are already in motion  to implement this 
agreement in a timely manner; however, it is still 
expected that it will take at least several weeks to 
complete. 
 
¶2. Comment:  The Mission views this as a most welcome, 
albeit late, development in addressing the issue 
surrounding U.S. biotech-derived food aid for Zimbabwe. 
If completed successfully, without major mishap, it 
should help considerably to alleviate fears, build 
mutual confidence and overcome future country (and 
even greater regional) reticence on this issue. 
However, the Mission cautions that as a one-off 
deal, this arrangement does not represent a long-term 
solution to this issue.  Continuing concerns regarding 
the GOZ's ability to maintain adequate maize stocks 
suggest that other/additional measures will be required 
to effect a more lasting solution to this issue in 
Zimbabwe.  End Comment. Sullivan
