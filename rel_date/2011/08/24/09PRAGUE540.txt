SUBJECT: CZECH COMMENTS ON SEPTEMBER GAERC 
 
REF: PRAGUE 526 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: On September 9 and 11 emboff spoke with 
Czech MFA Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) 
Department Deputy Director Magdalena Janesova in advance of 
the September 14-15 EU Foreign Ministers' meeting (GAERC). 
She offered brief comments on Iran, Afghanistan, and the EU's 
Eastern Partnership as it relates to the Caucasus.  End 
Summary. 
 
---------- 
Iran - Czechs Unwavering in Skepticism 
---------- 
¶2. (SBU) According to Janesova, the EU Foreign Ministers plan 
to discuss three items related to Iran - EU concerns about 
certain Iranian Ministerial appointments, the internal 
political situation following the June elections (as a subset 
of this, some European nationals are still being harassed and 
monitored), and the nuclear issue.  With respect to the 
Ministerial appointments, the EU is particularly concerned 
about the proposed Defense Minister, Ahmad Vahidi, given that 
he is currently wanted by Interpol for his terror links. 
Regarding European nationals, some member states are still 
having trouble getting their citizens out of Iran.  There is 
apparently one British diplomat who faces charges, while 
other nationals are being closely monitored.  On the nuclear 
issue, Janesova commented that the Czechs felt that the 
letter Iran delivered to the P5 1 on September 9 lacked 
substance and was simply another attempt by Iran to buy time. 
 As Janesova noted last week (reftel), the Czechs are not 
optimistic that Iran will have met any of its obligations by 
the end of September.  Czech MFA Political Director Ivo 
Sramek told POLEC Counselor that the Czechs will urge the EU 
to continue work on sanctions, even as the EU continues 
diplomatic engagement, in order to have sanctions ready if 
diplomacy fails. 
 
---------- 
Afghanistan 
---------- 
¶3. (SBU) Following up on the Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy 
paper produced by the European Commission and Council 
Secretariat and discussed by the Foreign Ministers on 
September 4 at the Gymnich, Janesova stated that the 
Commission and Council Secretariat are now working on a 
consolidated paper.  For October, the Czechs believe that the 
international community needs to be better prepared to assist 
with the next round of elections, particularly when it comes 
to monitoring the elections and establishing a secure 
environment for voters. 
 
---------- 
Eastern Partnership - Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan 
---------- 
¶4. (SBU) The Swedes have proposed this item for the Foreign 
Ministers to discuss at the GAERC, and the Czechs heartily 
endorsed this.  The idea is to enhance relations with these 
countries and the Czechs would like to see, as an outcome of 
this meeting, consensus within the EU to move forward with 
drafting Association Agreements for the Caucasus.  Janesova 
notes that there is some reluctance from certain EU member 
states to move forward, but she is hopeful that these member 
states may be brought around to the views of the majority. 
With respect to visa liberalization for these three 
countries, she noted that this is a very long way off for the 
Caucasus and the Czechs are some of the most optimistic 
within the EU. 
 
---------- 
AOB - Visa Issues 
---------- 
¶5. (SBU) Apparently there are relatively minor issues to be 
raised under Any Other Business (AOB) next week.  Janesova 
flagged for emboff that the Czechs have added the Canadian 
visa issue.  She noted that while ESTA has been discussed in 
a number of EU fora, it has not been added to the agenda of 
this GAERC.
