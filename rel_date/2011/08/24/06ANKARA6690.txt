¶1.  This is an action cable.  See paragraph 2. 
 
¶2.  Summary: We have reconfirmed the date of January 11 for 
launching the Iraq gas working group in Ankara.  Please 
forward as soon as possible the list of USG participants from 
Washington and Baghdad.  We would appreciate Embassy 
Baghdad's assistance in identifying appropriate Government of 
Iraq participants.  The main objective of the working group 
will be start dialogue on geology, politics, planning, and 
legislation on Iraqi gas development, including potential for 
export via Turkey.  The meetings will be chaired by Energy 
Undersecretary Sami Demirbilek, but we expect Minister Guler 
would make a statement.  End Summary. 
 
¶3.  Background: The idea of this working group came from a 
long-standing request from Energy Minister Guler to USG 
officials to consider Iraq potential as a supplementary 
source of gas, along with Caspian sources, for transit to 
Europe or other markets.  Ambassador and DAS Bryza agreed to 
recommend launching a trilateral Iraqi gas working group to 
start long time frame discussions, cognizant that hydrocarbon 
legislation was in play.  The GOT is eager to build on work 
done by some Turkish companies in northern Iraq in 
pre-sanctions time and also is interested in egress of 
potential gas via Turkey either for transit to Europe or 
possible processing at Ceyhan.

¶A. Resources 
-Iraq experts 
-USG experts 
-Earlier work by Turkish companies - TPAO and BOTAS 
¶B. Development Plans

¶C. Export potential - Egress via Turkey
