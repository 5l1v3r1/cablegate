REF: A. STATE 023568 
     ¶B. STATE 069343 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND:  On May 29, 2008, the United 
States hosted a Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) 
Outreach Workshop in Washington, attended by representatives 
of 21 countries that have not yet endorsed the PSI, as well 
as most of the 92 PSI participating states.  The workshop 
provided detailed information on the broad range of PSI 
activities and tools that have been developed for training, 
organizing for, and conducting interdictions of shipments of 
proliferation concern.  Volodymyr Bielashov, Director, Arms 
Control and Military-Technical Cooperation Directorate, MFA, 
gave a presentation on Ukraine's 2007 PSI exercise "Eastern 
Shield" (copy can be forwarded upon request). 
 
¶2.  ACTION REQUESTED:  Embassy is requested to deliver under 
appropriate cover the following letter from Acting Assistant 
Secretary Patricia McNerney to Mr. Bielashov, thanking him 
for his presentation.  There will be no signed original. 
 
¶3.  Begin text of letter: 
 
Dear Mr. Bielashov: 
 
I would like to thank you for giving the presentation on 
Ukraine's "Eastern Shield" exercise at the May 29, 2008 
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) Outreach Workshop in 
Washington, DC.  Your presentation made an important 
contribution to the Workshop. 
 
I believe the Outreach Workshop was very successful both 
because it informed states of the many ongoing PSI activities 
and because it provided states with concrete ways to improve 
their capabilities to stop WMD-related trafficking.  The 
United States greatly appreciates the significant role that 
Ukraine plays in advancing the PSI's goals, including in 
outreach.  We believe that we must continue PSI outreach, 
both to encourage more states to endorse the PSI and 
encourage states that have already endorsed to participate 
more actively.  We look forward to continuing our work 
together in support of the PSI. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Patricia A. McNerney 
Acting Assistant Secretary for International Security and 
Nonproliferation, 
Department of State
