SUBJECT: Coordinated Programming for 60th Anniversary of 
U.S.-Jordanian Relations and 60th Anniversary of Israel's 
Independence 
 
Reftel: Tel Aviv 3345 
 
¶1.  As mentioned in Reftel, Embassy Amman has begun planning several 
high-impact events to commemorate 60 years of U.S.-Jordanian 
diplomatic relations.  (While actual U.S. diplomatic recognition 
came in January 1949, we intend to begin our celebratory events in 
the summer 2008.)  Given Embassy Tel Aviv's expressed interest in 
bringing similar cultural programming to Israel for the 60th 
anniversary of Israeli independence and U.S.-Israel relations, Post 
suggests that Amman, Tel Aviv, and the Department work jointly to 
examine whether any large-scale or high impact cultural events 
headed to Tel Aviv for the 60th anniversary of Israel's independence 
might be suitable and feasible for programming in Amman at the same 
time.  We would, like Tel Aviv, need considerable financial 
assistance from ECA or R or NEA to program such high profile acts as 
Wynton Marsalis or a major theater troupe. 
 
¶2.  Post will reach out to ECA, NEA, and R to discuss possibilities, 
and requests that Embassy Amman be kept in mind when discussing 
possibilities for engaging cultural groups for Israel's 60th 
anniversary.  Given the two countries' proximity and diplomatic 
relations, it might work out smoothly and efficiently to program a 
group or troupe in both countries on the same tour.  We will also 
coordinate with Embassy Tel Aviv directly to see what sort of 
complementarity might exist in our respective plans for our two 
commemorations.
