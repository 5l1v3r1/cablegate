TITLE III OF LIBERTAD ACT 
 
REF: A. STATE 248337 
 
     ¶B. SANTO DOMINGO 3825 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to para 6 Ref A, Embassy finds there has 
been no marked change in the Dominican Republic's situation 
with regard to Cuba since our last report (Ref B). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The administration of President Fernandez, which 
took office August 16, has so far taken a low profile on 
Cuban issues.  As in previous years, the Dominican Republic 
in October joined the overwhelming majority of nations that 
approved a UNGA resolution criticizing the U.S. economic 
embargo against Cuba.  On November 25-26 in Santo Domingo, 
Dominican and Cuban officials held annual discussions on a 
program of technical cooperation and exchanges for 2005, 
continuing arrangements established under a 1998 agreement 
(details forthcoming septel). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Embassy considers that U.S. national interests and 
the actions of the Dominican Government fully justify a 
renewal of the waiver of Title III of the Libertad Act with 
regard to Dominican businesses that may be involved in joint 
ventures with the Government of Cuba or significant trade 
with Cuba.  Embassy inquiries have not resulted in 
identification of any Dominican companies or entities with 
investments or joint ventures that would trigger Title III 
concerns.  There is very little Dominican investment in Cuba, 
and Embassy has no information about any conflict between 
Dominican investors and U.S. citizens with property claims in 
Cuba.  Embassy has not received complaints by any U.S. 
citizens against any Dominican company related to any 
investment in Cuba or DR-Cuba trade. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The past Dominican administration cast a crucial 
vote to pass the Cuba resolution in the 60th Human Rights 
Commission meeting in Geneva.  The new administration, in 
office since August 16, is still defining its foreign policy. 
 If the suspension of Title III were not renewed and a U.S. 
citizen were to bring suit against an entity under Title III, 
its extraterritorial reach could affect the possibility of 
obtaining future Dominican support for diplomatic initiatives 
on behalf of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba.
