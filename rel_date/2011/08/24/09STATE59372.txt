 Â¶1. Post is authorized to present the following statement at 
the June 11, 2009, Permanent Council meeting in Vienna: 
 
Begin text: 
 
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 
 
The United States warmly welcomes to the Permanent Council 
the Project Coordinator in Ukraine, Ambassador Lubomir Kopaj. 
 We thank you for your comprehensive report.  We appreciate 
your dedication and strong leadership. 
 
The United States supports the excellent work being conducted 
by the OSCE,s Project Coordinator in Ukraine in all three 
dimensions.  The PCU operates in a challenging environment to 
advance OSCE commitments, and we commend your efforts to 
strengthen your partnership with the Ukrainian Government and 
other partners.  We also appreciate your efforts to improve 
the fiscal and administrative management of OSCE projects in 
Ukraine. 
 
We also commend the PCU,s strategic approach to addressing 
democracy development, good governance, and the rule of law 
concerns.  The anti-corruption, human rights, and 
institutional capacity building activities carried out by the 
Office will further progress in overall governance in Ukraine. 
 
The Office,s collaboration with government officials, 
stakeholders in the Ukrainian Parliament, academics, and 
others on developing a new electoral code and strengthening 
the capacity of the electoral commission demonstrate a keen 
understanding of the host country,s needs.  In light of the 
upcoming election, we were pleased to see the Office,s 
recent donation of computers and other equipment to improve 
the voter registration process. 
 
The United States urges increased focus on promoting 
tolerance among Ukraine,s ethnic populations to further 
social cohesiveness and stability.  The PCU can and should 
reinforce the work of the High Commissioner on National 
Minorities in reducing inter-ethnic tensions and mitigating 
conflict. 
 
We also support the Office,s continued efforts in the 
military and environmental areas.  In this regard, we 
strongly support the initiative to aid Ukrainian authorities 
in eliminating excess stockpiles of  conventional ammunition 
and rid the environment of thousands of old munitions, 
including mlange rocket fuel, that pose both safety and 
security risks in various regions.  Continued efforts in 
removing and destroying decades-old munitions require 
increased technical and financial resources, and we urge 
efforts to leverage the necessary assistance from a range of 
sources, including bilaterally, to supplement OSCE assistance. 
 
In light of the ongoing financial crisis that continues to 
confront Ukraine, we strongly support the PCU,s assistance 
to the host country in establishing conditions conducive to 
economic development, as well as its efforts to simplify and 
improve transparency in relevant regulatory mechanisms. 
 
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
