Prosecutor's Office initiated an investigation against Abdullah 
Demirbas, Sur District Mayor in Diyarbakir, who launched efforts

local languages of South Africa. 
 
EVRENSEL:       Regarding the incident about two villagers fired 
upon by security officers in Hakkari's Yuksekova district (see 
press summary for November 27), the Hakkari Governor's Office 
dismissed the allegations that the office initially announced 
immediately after the incident that the two persons were PKK 
terrorists.  The Governor's office claimed that some media was 
misinforming the public about it, and the office allegedly only 
stated that "two persons did not obey security officers' halt 
warning and entered into clash with the security personnel." 
 
EVRENSEL:       Author Orhan Miroglu, who is a member of party 
assembly of DTP, said that the government should express more

the PKK.
