REF: SEPTEL 
 
¶1.  (SBU) ICRC Middle East and North Africa Regional Director 
Balthasar Staehelin told the Ambassador August 9 that ICRC 
successfully mounted a humanitarian mission August 8 to 
evacuate approximately 230 civilians from Houla, south of the 
Litani River.  (See Septel.)  Staehelin said that ICRC 
deconflicted its movements with both the Northern Command of 
the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and with Hizballah fighters. 
Staehelin explained that ICRC moved in a secure "bubble" or 
"box" established to envelope a small convoy of ICRC 
vehicles, rather than through any sort of secure "corridor" 
demarcated on the battlefield. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ICRC established a secure bubble, Staehelin said, 
by asking the combatants to refrain from firing on or near 
the precise route of the convoy; the bubble was limited both 
geographically and temporally, according to the deconflicted 
route and schedule of the ICRC vehicles.  A secure corridor, 
by contrast, relies on geography rather than movement, is not 
feasible in a combat zone and has proved less effective at 
affording protection to humanitarian convoys, according to 
Staehelin.  He also emphasized that the coordination 
necessary to create a secure bubble requires clear and 
precise communication among ICRC, Hizballah, and the IDF. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Ambassador asked whether ICRC has considered 
using satellite tracking equipment to help protect their 
vehicles.  Staehelin said that these instruments would draw 
attention to ICRC vehicles that could lead to their theft, 
and could attract civilians or combatants to follow ICRC 
vehicles along their routes, under the assumption that the 
equipment provides reliable protection.
