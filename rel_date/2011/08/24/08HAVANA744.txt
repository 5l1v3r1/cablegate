REF: HAVANA 722 
 
¶1.    (U) Hurricane Ike has wreaked havoc across eastern, 
central, and western Cuba as it traversed virtually the 
entire island from September 8-9.  U.S. Interests Section 
personnel do not have direct access to these regions of Cuba, 
but have received reports from Cuban NGOs, international 
organizations, and foreign and Cuban media of serious damage 
to houses, other buildings, infrastructure, and agricultural 
production in these areas.  These reports include almost 
every province of Cuba, ranging from Guantanamo in the 
extreme east to Pinar del Rio on the western tip of Cuba. 
Pinar del Rio province already was reeling from the 
devastating effects of Category 4 hurricane Gustav just ten 
days earlier. 
 
¶2.    (U) Accordingly, the Chief of Mission requests an 
additional $500,000 in assistance from USAID/OFDA for 
emergency relief to these affected areas.  In accordance with 
prior discussions with WHA/CCA, AID/LAC, and AID/OFDA, COM 
believes that the USG should consider providing this 
assistance through a USG contribution to the International 
Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), in response to the IFRC's 
September 9 appeal for $5.8 million for relief programs in 
Cuba to address the needs of the population affected by 
hurricanes Gustav and Ike.  Our understanding is that the 
IFRC would provide its assistance through the Cuban Red Cross 
affiliate, which reportedly has a network throughout Cuba. 
Because this would indirectly funnel USG assistance through 
GOC channels, there will need to be a policy decision made 
that the USG is prepared to take such a step given the 
exigent circumstances. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) The COM on September 10 signed separate 
agreements with Caritas and the Methodist Church in Cuba to 
provide $80,000 and $20,000 respectively in humanitarian 
assistance for the damages from hurricane Gustav.  Both 
Caritas and the Methodist church have told USINT that they 
are re-evaluating their relief efforts in the wake of 
hurricane Ike but that they are not in position now to expand 
their current operations.  Both organizations prefer to 
purchase locally their relief supplies, and Caritas in 
particular emphasized that it already has run into supply 
problems due to local scarcities.  Both Caritas and the 
Methodist Church would be prime candidates for follow-on USG 
funding in addition to the $500,000 for the IFRC once they 
have settled into their relief efforts and been able to plan 
and build potential capacity for broader-based relief 
programs. 
 
¶4.    (SBU) In that regard, USINT urges discretion in 
avoiding references to Caritas and the Methodist Church in 
any public diplomacy regarding USG relief provided to Cuba 
via humanitarian organizations.  Caritas is especially 
sensitive to any public reference to assistance it might 
receive from the USG, and in Havana avoids any discussion of 
USG assistance in public or over the telephone.  Highlighting 
the roles of Caritas or the Methodist church as recipients of 
USG aid would draw unwelcome attention from the GOC and 
jeopardize their ability to work with us in the future. 
 
¶5.    (U) COM also requests the re-designation of an OFDA 
assessment team to travel to Cuba to assess additional 
humanitarian assistance requirements should the GOC change 
its position and accede to such a visit.  USINT Havana 
appreciates OFDA assistance provided already for hurricane 
Gustav relief and looks forward to working with OFDA to 
address this latest humanitarian crisis.
