CONFERENCE POSTPONEMENT 
 
REF: HILLAH 000019 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Najaf Provincial Council Tourism 
Committee, chaired by Sheikh Fayed al-Shimerti, reluctantly 
decided to postpone the April 5-6 Najaf Tourism Conference 
(reftel) for exactly one month in the wake of country-wide 
disruptions from the recent Basrah offensive.  The conference is 
now scheduled for May 5-6 and will incorporate all of the 
elements planned for the originally slated dates.  The Tourism 
Committee postponed the conference to ensure full participation 
from Iraqi and regional participants, and not because of any 
Najaf province security concerns.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Sheikh Fayed also chairs the Provincial Council's 
Security Committee and held multiple meetings with Najaf's Iraqi 
Police and Army commanders over the past week.  Najaf remained 
calm with little violence throughout the fall-out from the 
Basrah offensive and its corresponding violence and unrest in 
Baghdad and elsewhere in South-Central Iraq.  Najaf Sadr Trend 
sympathizers took to the streets in peaceful protest but engaged 
specifically in Muqtada al-Sadr's call for civil disobedience, 
brandishing Korans and olive branches.  Sheikh Fayed based his 
decision, after close consultations with PRT Team Leader, not on 
Najaf security concerns but concern about the impact of Gulf and 
other international participants of limited access to Basrah and 
Baghdad airports, plus difficult travel conditions for Iraqi 
government, provincial, and private sector invitees. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Sheikh Fayed specifically told PRT Team Leader that 
invited tourism professors from Baghdad's Mustansiryah 
University and scheduled Iraqi fashion performers were not able 
to arrive from Baghdad, and that most of the invited regional 
attendees could not fly through Basrah airport as initially 
planned.  Without these crucial components, Sheikh Fayed 
considered a postponement necessary.  Sheikh Fayed and the 
Provincial Council announced the reason for the conference's 
postponement was to increase international and business 
participation, not because of Najaf security concerns. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT.  Throughout the recent unrest in Iraq, the 
PRT and the Tourism Committee remained in constant contact about 
the conference and provincial security conditions.  Sheikh 
Fayed, a senior and well-respected PC member, has been 
completely open in discussing security concerns and the tourism 
conference.  Sheikh Fayed's Committee prepared a successful 
conference concept and multi-faceted means to showcase Najaf and 
encourage investment in the province's tourism potential.  Both 
he and the PRT considered Najaf safe and secure enough to hold 
the conference on April 5-6 but also agreed the need for fuller 
international and Iraqi participation.  Despite the month long 
delay, we expect the Najaf Tourism Conference to be an important 
activity stressing opportunity and hope for Najaf's future.  END 
COMMENT.
