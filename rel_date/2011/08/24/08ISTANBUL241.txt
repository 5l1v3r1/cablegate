¶1.  Albania will serve as organization for Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation (BSEC) Chairman in Office from May 1 - October 
¶31.  On May 12 at BSEC headquarters in Istanbul, Albanian 
Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha addressed representatives of 
the BSEC member states, observers and related bodies, 
describing Albania's goals and objectives for the upcoming 
six months.  His presentation focused on three key elements: 
increasing BSEC's profile on the international stage, 
implementing on-going reforms, and furthering cooperation 
with international organizations, particularly the EU and 
UNDP. 
 
¶2.  Basha highlighted the 55 events scheduled to occur during 
the Albanian presidency, expressing his determination to both 
maintain on-going efforts as well as create new projects that 
will bolster the visibility of the organization.  Basha noted 
his goal of increasing the flexibility of BSEC as well as 
enhancing cooperation at the sectoral level.  In addition to 
reviewing a laundry list of issues on which the Albania 
chairmanship will work, including transport, energy and 
tourism, Basha noted that the Black Sea Ring Highway and the 
Motorways of the Sea projects would be of special focus 
during the Albanian chairmanship. 
 
¶3.  Regarding international organizations, Basha noted 
Albania's goal of increasing and formalizing the interaction 
between BSEC and the EU, including through a declaration of 
relations between the two organizations, to facilitate 
greater involvement by individual EU member states in BSEC. 
Basha also briefly made reference to UNDP, encouraging 
increased cooperation with that organization. 
 
¶4.  The only question following Basha's remarks came from the 
Ukrainian Consul General, who asked whether to expect a 
meeting of trade ministers focusing on issues including a 
BSEC free-trade agreement, during the new chairmanship.  BSEC 
Secretary General Chrysanthopoulos noted that past 
discussions of intra-BSEC trade facilitation measures had not 
been successful, but that timing now appears to be more 
favorable.  Chrysanthopoulos indicated that ministerial 
statements by member state trade ministers would add further 
impetus to the discussion of trade arrangements. 
 
¶5.   Consulate General Istanbul will continue to attend BSEC 
meetings held in Istanbul on subjects of interest to the USG. 
 A complete calendar of events and meetings for the May - 
October period is posted on the web at 
http://www.bsec-organization.org/meetings.asp x .  In general 
BSEC meetings unrelated to financial and personnel matters 
are open to observers; however, meetings described as "ad 
hoc" or "informal" normally include only member states. 
During the Albanian presidency we intend to observe the May 
19-21 meetings on combating crime, the September 17-19 
meeting of senior officials, and the Sept/Oct meetings on 
environmental protection.  The Department and/or Embassy 
Tirana may wish to consider sending a delegation to the 
Meeting of the BSEC Ministers of Energy tentatively planned 
for September/October in Tirana as well as the October 21-22 
meeting of senior officials and the October 23 Council of 
Foreign Ministers.  Embassy Bucharest may wish to consider 
sending an observer to the June 9-13 
Regional Conference on Strengthening the Criminal Justice 
Response to Trafficking in Persons in the Black Sea Region. 
Embassy Athens may wish to consider participating in the 
October 8-9 Black Sea Energy Conference.
