SUBJECT: PRT GARDEZ:  PAKTIA PROVINCE SIX MONTH REPORT 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Security incidents have increased with the onset of 
warm weather in Paktia, but vigorous government and coalition 
counter-insurgency activities have maintained a climate that 
allows for expanded economic development and the gradual 
extension of GOA administrative control.  The new governor is 
engaging tribal leaders to build support for the central 
government.  He must overcome widespread disenchantment, 
suspicion of the Kabul administration, and frustration over a 
lack of basic government services.  Paktia,s economy, which 
is based on subsistence agriculture, will require significant 
assistance to be reflected in an improvement in the standard 
of living.  The PRT's USAID and US military aid programs, 
along with German implementer GTZ, are the major sources of 
international assistance.  UNAMA and several NGO's are 
present in the province, but donors remain reluctant to fund 
projects due to lingering security concerns.  Paktia's 
conservative, predominantly Pashtun population impinges on 
women,s rights.  Weak rule of law institutions increase 
dependence on traditional dispute resolution mechanisms. 
Despite these drawbacks, international players in the field 
are optimistic that, with sufficient resources, progress is 
possible.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SECURITY:  HEIGHTENED INSURGENCY BUT OVERALL IMPROVEMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The number and scale of security incidents in 
Paktia have significantly increased during the past six 
months.  The onset of warm weather has facilitated 
insurgent movement into the area from neighboring Pakistan, 
but overall violence appears to be less severe than last year 
at this time, mostly due to GOA and Coalition taking the 
initiative against insurgents.  ANA performance has improved 
steadily, while the ANP remains weak.  Corruption remains an 
issue for the ANP.  The Gardez Regional Training Center (RTC) 
has trained over 300 ANAP recruits who have been deployed in 
the province -- with mixed results.  The Taliban still 
control parts of Southern Zormat District, an insurgent 
bastion and staging area, and remain active, though less 
influential, in the strategic Khost/Gardez Pass.  Security is 
sufficiently stable in the rest of Paktia to enable economic 
development efforts to continue and expand. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Pakistan-Afghan border of Northern Jaji and 
Dand Wa Pathan Districts remains tense, but stable following 
clashes in May between Afghan security forces and Pakistan 
military elements.  Immediately following the border 
flare-up, Coalition and Afghan forces ambushed a 300 man 
Taliban force seeking to overrun the Jaji district center, 
killing up to 120 of the insurgents.  Most combat continues 
in Zormat where the ANA scored a success in killing three top 
Taliban commanders in a single encounter.  IED attacks 
continue throughout the province.  The most devastating 
incident took place in May in Gardez where a suicide bomber 
killed 14 innocent bystanders while attempting to attack a 
coalition convoy. 
 
POLITICAL:  AGGRESSIVE GOVERNOR AND WEAK INSTITUTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Since assuming his duties last November, Governor 
Rahmatullah Rahmat has proven to be an energetic 
administrator who has emphasized anti-corruption and 
administrative efficiency.  The Attorney General,s Office 
gave a boost to these efforts by arresting and dismissing 
several high level provincial officials, including the 
Education and Health Directors.  The notoriously corrupt 
Police Chief was replaced with a more effective officer. 
Rahmat has attempted to appoint capable officials in key 
areas, including Zormat, and has brought loyalists into the 
administration. He wields a firm hand with local officials 
and traditional leaders and meets frequently with them. 
Rahmat and his department directors complain about a lack of 
central government funding for their activities.

¶5. (SBU) Perceptions of and allegiance to the provincial and 
district administrators depends largely on the personalities 
and capabilities of individual administrators.  The 
government,s continued inability to 
provide basic services is reflected in a cynical attitude 
toward government among most Paktians, who, in turn, continue 
to rely on traditional authorities.  Local 
residents view the central government as weak, corrupt, 
and incompetent, though the most visceral condemnations 
are reserved for neighboring Pakistan for promoting the 
insurgency and seeking to destabilize the region. 
Parliamentarians representing the province in Kabul 
are not significant players in Paktia, though MP and 
former Mujahideen commander Pacha Khan Zadran has a 
notable personal following.  The Provincial Council 
plays a useful role in promoting development projects 
but is still evolving as a political institution. 
 
ECONOMIC:  ENORMOUS DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) The Paktia economy is based primarily on subsistence 
or semi-subsistence farming.  Commerce and smuggling with 
Pakistan and remittances from abroad provide some 
compensatory income, the province has enormous development 
needs.  The stable security situation in most areas of Paktia 
has encouraged some Afghan and international NGO's to 
increase their engagement.  UNAMA,s Southeastern Regional 
Headquarters is located in Gardez.  Lingering security 
concerns continue to deter most donors and the PRT continues 
to play a key development role. 
 
CULTURAL/SOCIAL:  TRADITIONAL NORMS PREVAIL 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) Paktia,s conservative, rural population is 90 
percent Pashtun, most living in isolated communities. 
About 70 percent of the population is illiterate, and 
traditional tribal social norms prevail.  Despite some 
improvements, women typically suffer from limited access to 
education, forced marriages, "badan" (exchange of female 
relatives as compensation in a tribal feud), and honor 
crimes.  Tribal disputes are commonplace, especially over 
land issues, and are typically resolved by traditional 
inter-tribal councils, sometimes overseen by the Governor. 
Dependence on traditional dispute resolution mechanisms is 
due in part to the weak rule of law sector in Paktia.  Judges 
and prosecutors are poorly paid, under-trained, and 
vulnerable to corruption. 
 
¶8. (SBU) While the ANA generally has respected human 
rights, allegations of abuse have emerged from the 
Taliban-influenced Zormat District, scene of most combat 
operations in the province.  These allegations include: 
arbitrary arrest and detention, the theft of property 
during searches, extortion, and extra-legal execution.  The 
provincial National Security Directorate (PDS) has been 
accused of arbitrary arrest and extortion.  Some citizens 
complained of being wrongfully targeted for operations by the 
ANA and US forces. 
 
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM DESPITE OBSTACLES 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Paktia,s tribal social structures and lack of 
economic developed helps make it vulnerable to insurgents. 
Lack of capacity and funding for government institutions, 
further hampered by corruption, remain major impediments to 
expanded government influence.  The people of Paktia 
nevertheless are receptive to international efforts and loyal 
to the concept of an Afghan national identity.  Efforts to 
improve the situation are beginning to bear fruit, but 
progress is grudging and incremental.  Coalition and GOA 
efforts to improve security seem to be succeeding, especially 
with the commitment of more troops to the region.
