exposed following his death.  While recent events in Abyei have 
served to solidify unity within the ranks of the SPLA and may make 
soldiers more tolerant of late pay, the SPLA has burned through 
nearly $400 million in just six months, an alarming rate by any 
measure.  Much of this is for pay, but it is also possible that the 
SPLA is arming itself as much as possible while oil revenues 
continue to flow from the North, in preparation for the day when 
conflict may resume and oil transfers may stop. That may not be a 
bad idea at all on the face of it, but there is an efficient way to 
do this and an ill-disciplined, sloppy way and the SPLA seems to 
have followed the latter.
