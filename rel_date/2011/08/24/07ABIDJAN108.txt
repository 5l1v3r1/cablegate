Ambassador Bernard Tanoh Boutchoue, Director of the Office of 
United Nations and Specialized Institutions Affairs in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Ambassador Boutchoe assured us 
that Cote d'Ivoire would support the draft charter, but said 
he had heard that with all the other urgent matters on the 
agenda for that day's AU Summit, they might not have time to 
discuss it.  He promised to call the Foreign Minister at the 
summit to relay the U.S.message of support for the charter.
