REF: CARACAS 558 
 
¶1.  (U) The Ministry of Finance (MoF) published on April 28 
the results of the Sovereign International Bond (SIB) 
issuance announced April 21 (reftel).  Per these results, the 
MoF will sell SIBs worth a total amount (face value) of USD 4 
billion.  The announcement does not specify the amount 
allocated to "productive companies" (companies in the food, 
health, and capital goods sectors (or at least importers in 
those sectors) that are registered with the BRV's foreign 
exchange control authority) as opposed to individual 
investors and other legal entities (including other 
companies).  The maximum allocated to a given "productive 
company" was USD 30 million; the maximum allocated to a given 
individual investor was USD 500,000; and the maximum 
allocated to a given legal entity was USD 2.5 million. 
Offers from banks and other companies in the financial sector 
were not considered.  The announcement notes that the SIBs 
will "not be subject to the non-compliance clause that 
stipulates that the Republic must maintain its membership in 
the IMF." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  The fact that the size of this issuance 
is USD 1 billion greater than the MoF announced on April 21 
indicates continued strong local demand for dollars at a 
price in between the official and parallel exchange rates. 
Indeed, the MoF said that it received orders for over 9 
billion USD worth of the bonds.  It will be difficult for the 
BRV to issue additional large quantities of external debt 
this year as international enthusiasm for BRV debt is low 
(making the price on secondary markets, and thus the implicit 
exchange rate, less attractive).  Given the BRV's dedication 
to supplying the parallel market with dollars in an effort to 
control the parallel rate, it will be interesting to see what 
dollar-denominated instruments the BRV uses in the future. 
End comment.
