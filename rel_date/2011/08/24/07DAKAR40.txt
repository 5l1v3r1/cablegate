¶1.  SUMMARY:  At the 24th Session of UNEP's Governing Council, 
Senegal will likely support efforts to establish a legally binding 
treaty to control mercury, believing that such a convention will be 
a significant asset in the administrative and legal control of 
mercury, according to Mrs. Fatima Dia Toure, Director for 
Environment and International Affairs at Senegal's Ministry of 
Environment and Natural Resources Protection.  In her opinion, U.S. 
support for the UNEP's voluntary partnerships approach has merit and 
will hopefully continue, but it is not a substitute for an 
international treaty.  At this time, Environment Minister Thierno Lo 
is planning to lead the Senegalese delegation to February 5-9 
meetings in Nairobi.  Toure will likely accompany and be the key 
working-level contact.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  Per reftel request, on January 4, Economic Counselor discussed 
mercury issues for the 24th Session of UNEP's Governing Council with 
Mrs. Fatima Dia Toure, Director for Environment and International 
Affairs at Senegal's Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources 
Protection.  Pathe Balde, Chief of the Department of Living 
Environment, and Astou Diop, Chemical Expert, also attended the 
meeting.  Toure expressed her appreciation for the information on 
the U.S. position, and highlighted the helpful role that the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency has played in helping Senegal with 
an initial assessment of mercury issues in the country.  Toure noted 
that Senegal is not a producer of mercury, but that the element is 
an important factor in the country's artisanal gold mines and 
medical installations.  She also noted that trade in mercury and its 
residue has been associated with counterfeiting/money laundering in 
West Africa. 
 
¶3.  According to Toure, Senegal is a strong supporter of efforts to 
establish a legally binding treaty to control mercury, and 
Senegalese officials held related consultations with Norway and 
Switzerland.  For Senegal, international conventions provide the 
force of law that enables local authorities to enforce effective 
practices, in this case, for the beneficial control of mercury. 
Such a treaty is also of great help in "regionalizing" the effective 
control of mercury.  She asserted that even if Senegal established a 
robust internal program on mercury, it would not be effective if 
there were not similar controls in neighboring states.  Finally, 
Toure claimed that Senegal needs to develop regulations that are 
harmonized among all West African Economic and Monetary Union 
(WAEMU) countries. 
 
¶4.  Toure agreed that the U.S. support for the UNEP's voluntary 
partnerships approach has merit but opined that it could not be a 
substitute for an international convention.  She expressed her hope 
that the U.S. and UNEP, and others, could continue their efforts to 
assist developing countries in the near term, as a convention is 
being negotiated.  Toure also highlighted the importance of bringing 
new technologies to developing countries, citing the example of an 
Australian company in Senegal that is able to recycle almost all of 
the mercury used in its gold mining operations. 
 
¶5.  As for Senegal's participation in the 24th Session of UNEP's 
 
DAKAR 00000040  002 OF 002 
 
 
Governing Council, Environment Minister Thierno Lo is planning to 
lead the Senegalese delegation.  We believe that Mrs. Toure will 
also likely participate as the Minister's key advisor and as 
Senegal's lead working-level contact.
