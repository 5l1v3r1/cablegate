OBSERVER STATUS 
 
REF: GENEVA 961 
 
(SBU) This cable responds to Geneva's query on acceptable 
nomenclature for a World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial 
Council observer delegation from the Palestinian Authority 
(PA)(reftel).  If questions over the nomenclature under which 
the delegation will be seated threaten support for the PA,s 
latest request, the U.S. representative should advise that 
the WTO be guided by the precedent set at the 2005 
Ministerial Council in Hong Kong, when Palestinian Authority 
was used.  That said, the U.S. representative need not object 
to any nomenclature to which both the PA and Israel can 
agree.
