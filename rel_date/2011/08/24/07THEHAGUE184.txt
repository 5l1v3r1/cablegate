THE HAGUE 00000184  002.4 OF 002 
 
 
The Dutch are looking at several small NGO projects, as well.  Dutch 
MFA Human Rights Policy Officer Sonja van der Meer said that it has 
been "increasingly difficult to identify (Iranian) organizations 
that are willing to receive foreign funding.  However, since the 
major UN programs are by now sufficiently funded," the MFA is 
looking for NGO/civil society partners. 
 
Request for Information on U.S. Programs: 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) In providing the above information, the Dutch MFA Human 
Rights Division (which also provided information reported ref C), 
repeated its request that we provide similarly detailed information 
on USG-supported human rights and democratization programs related 
to Iran.  Post believes it would be useful to share such information 
in government-to-government channels.  We therefore request that the 
Department provide a fact sheet or other documentation in a format 
which can be provided to the Dutch, either via post or through the 
Dutch Embassy in Washington.
