Although informal groups have occasionally and temporarily 
formed in response to terrorist attacks in Egypt (most 
recently an informal group organized a demonstration 
condemning the July 2005 attacks in Sharm el-Sheikh), Embassy 
Cairo is not aware of any domestic groups or NGOs focused on 
advocacy for victims of terrorism.
