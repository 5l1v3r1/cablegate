     ¶B. REF B: SECSTATE 164089 
 
¶1. (SBU) Visiting Sudan Programs Group (SPG) Director Lauren 
Landis briefed a range of Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) 
officials on current and prospective U.S. security sector 
assistance during her September 28-30 visit to Juba.  Landis' 
discussions with GoSS President Salva Kiir are reported ref. 
¶A.  Kiir and others expressed concern over the perceived slow 
pace of implementation of some agreed projects.  Landis 
underscored USG commitment to these projects and endeavored 
to take several steps to improve coordination among the GoSS, 
the USG, and contractors. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) Chief of Staff 
General Oyai Deng told Landis September 30 that he understood 
that construction of an SPLA headquarters facility at Rumshel 
is not feasible at this time.  He urged rapid construction of 
an interim headquarters at Juba.  Landis informed Deng that 
after various difficulties, the USG is now authorized to 
expend money to build the Juba site.  Officials from the 
contractor DynCorp, also present at the meeting, said once a 
final "notice to proceed" is received, they will be ready to 
begin work on the Juba headquarters and that work could be 
completed within 105 days or, with additional pressure, "by 
Christmas."  Landis urged all concerned to work together to 
agree to a final site plan and said she planned to return to 
Juba before the end of the year to help inaugurate the 
headquarters.  Reps from ConGen Juba, SPLA and DynCorp also 
agreed to meet once per week until further notice to review 
progress on the headquarters construction and other projects. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Landis delivered ref. B demarche concerning the 
forthcoming visit of a seven-person delegation led by Michael 
Bittrick, AF Deputy Director for Regional Security Affairs. 
Plans for the visit were subsequently put on hold due to 
travel restrictions imposed by the Sudanese Government.  All 
GoSS officials with whom we spoke welcomed the visit.  Post 
hopes it can be rescheduled at the earliest opportunity. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Dyncorp provided an update on vehicles and 
communications assistance under the current scope of work. 
Four of the promised trucks are in Juba, DynCorp said, 17 
more are "stuck in Customs at Yei," and the remaining 60 are 
due to reach Juba by October 8.  DynCorp and SPLA officials 
agreed that both sides need to finalize training arrangements 
for vehicle drivers. 
 
¶5. (U) SPG Director Landis was not able to review this 
message before departure.
