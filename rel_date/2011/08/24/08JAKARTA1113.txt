SUBJECT: INDONESIA - JUNE 6 AVIAN INFLUENZA UPDATE 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  In a move that surprised many of her 
subordinates, Minister of Health Siti Fadilah Supari has told her 
staff to no longer report avian influenza (AI) human deaths to the 
World Health Organization after they've been confirmed by Ministry 
of Health (MOH) laboratories.  Indonesian press currently reports 
Indonesian case fatalities at 109 deaths, while WHO officially lists 
the deaths at 108.  The in-depth assessment of USG funded AI 
activities in Indonesia began on June 4 with a two-day launch 
workshop and will continue through June 25.  The National Committee 
for Avian Influenza Control and Pandemic Preparedness (KOMNAS) 
hosted a May 29 stock taking meeting to review Avian Influenza (AI) 
strategies and control measures.  USAID hosted a follow-up meeting 
with donors on 30 May to review KOMNAS findings and discuss 
implications for future donor support

Supari Policy to Stop Reporting Deaths 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On June 4, the Associated Press reported that Indonesia 
will no longer formally announce AI deaths, as part of a new policy 
to improve Indonesia's image.  Minister of Health Supari is quoted 
as wanting to focus on positive achievements made by the government 
in combating bird flu. She notes she will eventually share the data, 
but in batches.  According to embassy sources, many Ministry of 
Health (MOH) officials, including key officials, were surprised to 
hear the announcement and do not agree with the policy.  One 
official told us that this change is not in compliance with 
Indonesian national law or international heath regulations and that 
he is writing the Minister to notify her that she is required by law 
to notify the public as quickly as possible about infectious disease 
threats.  The MOH is convening a meeting on June 7 to review the 
policy. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The WHO website lists Indonesia with 133 cases with 108 
deaths, while Indonesian press reports 109 deaths.  However, in a 
MOH powerpoint presentation, Dr. Nyoman Kandun, Director General of 
Centers for Disease Control, used a slide listing 136 cases and 110 
deaths. An official with WHO told us that they do not report cases 
officially until announced by the Minister's office.  WHO has 
inquired why the last several cases discussed in the press have not 
been announced but have not received a response. According to WHO 
staff, WHO's country representative does not think meeting with the 
minister will be helpful.
