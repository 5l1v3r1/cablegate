SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Lebanon has begun disbursing its $1 million assistance 
pledge to Gaza, sending a first shipment of medical supplies and 
blankets via Jordan on January 3.  Subsequent deliveries will depend 
on needs submitted by the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.  The 
Lebanese-Palestinian Dialogue Committee also launched a media 
campaign asking for cash donations for Gaza.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) After the Lebanese cabinet's $1 million assistance pledge 
to Gaza on December 30, Lebanon sent its first shipment of in-kind 
assistance to Gaza by plane via Jordan on January 3.  The shipment 
consisted of 17 tons of medical supplies and equipment as well as 
2,060 blankets, which were delivered to Gaza through the Hashemite 
Association and UNRWA, according to Lebanese Health Ministry Advisor 
Dr. Rasha Hamra.  Ambassador Khalil Mekkawi, head of the 
Lebanese-Palestinian Dialogue Committee, estimated the value of this 
first load of assistance to be approximately $200,000. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Lebanon will send subsequent deliveries to fulfill the 
million-dollar pledge based on needs submitted by the Palestinian 
Health Ministry in Gaza, Mekkawi and Hamra told us separately.  The 
Lebanese Health Ministry and the Lebanese-Palestinian Dialogue 
Committee are coordinating efforts to provide the aid.  Mekkawi said 
he would inquire about the Gaza Health Ministry's additional needs 
over the next week.  Meanwhile, the Lebanese Health Ministry is 
working to secure medical supplies to send to Gaza, Hamra told us. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In its December 30 meeting, the cabinet also approved the 
launch of a campaign to collect contributions for Gaza.  After the 
new year, the Lebanese-Palestinian Dialogue Committee launched a 
media campaign appealing to the Lebanese to contribute money for 
Gaza, and opened an account under its name at the Central Bank of 
Lebanon for this purpose, Mekkawi told us.  He does not know how 
much money has been deposited into this account to date, but said 
that as yet no money has been transferred from this account to Gaza.
