¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered talking points per reftel on October 27 
to the MFA's Supervising Director for Multilateral, Passport and 
Legal Affairs, Kwesi Quartey.  Quartey noted that Ghana has 
traditionally voted in favor of self-determination for the 
Palestinian people and said he was not aware of any changes in GOG 
policy.  Nevertheless, Quartey indicated that Ghana's vote on 
whether to renew the mandates of the three UN bodies in question 
would take into account its close relationship with the U.S. and its 
long-standing practice of following the lead of the AU.  Thus, he 
could not yet offer a definitive GOG position. 
 
¶2.  (U) Post will apprise addressees of any subsequent substantive 
response from the GOG.
