Ref. Subject:  The GMEI and the G-8's Proposed Pilot 
Microfinance Program in Yemen 
 
Dear Mr. EDSON, 
 
Thank you for your letter of May 6, 2004 on the above 
subject.  I am pleased to inform you that Yemen welcomes the 
Greater Middle East Initiative (GMEI) and express our 
willingness to host a pilot program of the G-8's proposed 
microfinance initiative within the Greater Middle East 
region. 
 
Yemen is also willing to participate in the proposed "Forum 
of the Future" which would bring together officials from the 
G-8 and regional ministers of Finance, Trade and Foreign 
Affairs. 
 
As I conveyed to you in our last meeting in Washington and in 
the conversation we had earlier last week, Yemen has since 
the mid-1990s embarked on a rigorous program of reforms 
across socio-economic and political fronts, that received the 
respect and admiration of the international community but 
with little development assistance. 
 
Despite progress on reforms, Yemen has a long way to go in 
terms of achieving long-term economic growth and sustainable 
employment and poverty reduction.  Yemen has increasing trust 
that the international community and Washington in particular 
would now consider enhanced development aid to assist Yemen 
maintain the reform process and provide much needed financing 
to confront socio-economic challenges.  Yemen remains one of 
the least ODA recipient countries among LDCs. 
 
 
Again, it is our understanding that US-led initiatives would 
eventually contribute towards addressing the region's 
economic and social needs in a more positive way. 
 
We trust your support and look forward to working together on 
making this pilot exercise a model in our part of the world. 
Best regards. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Ahmed M. SOFAN
