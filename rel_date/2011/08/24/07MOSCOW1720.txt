TACTICA LTD., MOSCOW, RUSSIA, LICENSE NO. D357067 
 
REFTEL: USDOC 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Tactica Ltd., Moscow, Russia. The company is 
listed on BIS license application D357067 as the 
ultimate consignee of 60 holographic sights model: 
552.A65, 180 holographic sights model: 551.A65, 120 
holographic sightings model: 512.A65, 240 holographic 
sights model: 511.A65 and 200 holographic sights 
model: 551.D1. These items are controlled for firearms 
convention, crime control, and UN sanctions reasons 
under ECCN 0A987. The licensee is Leupold and Stevens, 
Inc., 14400 NW Greenbrier Parkway, Beaverton, OR 
¶97006. 
 
¶3. On March 27, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with Tactica 
Ltd., 138 Varshavskoe Shosse, Moscow, Russia. The 
export control team met with Sergey Korznikov, 
Commercial Director and Alexander Zviagin, General 
Director. 
 
 
¶4. Tactica is a retail sporting goods and tactical 
supplies store, specializing in optics.  Mr. 
Korznikov, a former member of the Federal Security 
Service (Russian acronym FSB) Alfa Group, founded the 
company in 2004.  NOTE: FSB Alfa Group is a special 
operations capable anti-terrorist unit. END NOTE. The 
company started as an internet-based business, but 
expanded within weeks to a showroom when Korznikov's 
neighbor decided to invest 200,000 USD in the new 
venture.  Tactica imports 90% of its inventory from 
the United States, and is a distributor for U.S. 
manufacturers such as 5.11, Blackhawk, SureFire, and 
others. The company employs 11 and operates from its 
showroom and office in a multi-tenant commercial 
building in southern Moscow. 
 
¶5. Tactica is the official law enforcement and 
military distributor for Leupold and Stevens in 
Russia. The weapons sights in reftel were sold and 
transferred to law enforcement and military end users 
in Russia.  The team was allowed to examine the 
purchase records, and was given copies of the end use 
statements and invoices. The remainder of the units 
requested in the license will be ordered over the next 
year. Mr. Korznikov stated that it has been difficult 
to keep these types of optics in stock for more than a 
week, as the demand for them within the military and 
law enforcement tactical units is high.  Stock is 
maintained in a locked storeroom on site, and the 
store is protected by an electronic alarm system with 
remote monitoring by the security guards at the 
building complex. 
 
¶6. According to Mr. Korznikov, units are going outside 
of the normal procurement channels to directly 
purchase these commodities, as similar optics from 
Russia are not as good.  Mr. Korznikov reports that 
most of these purchases are guided from the field 
officer level, as the staff officers are reluctant to 
purchase western equipment.  This is due principally 
to a "KGB mentality" as Mr. Korznikov labels it, that 
is common among the Generals.  The General Staff 
believes that the field level operators are well 
equipped; however most units in places like the 
Caucuses are depending on Soviet-era tactical gear. 
¶7. Often, former operators who have gone on to 
successful positions in business will, as a 
"humanitarian gesture" to their old units, finance the 
purchase of western equipment that the official 
Ministry of Defense supply chain will not.  Mr. 
Korznikov has worked closely with his former 
colleagues to get the units better tactical load 
bearing gear such as vests and rifle slings, as well 
as optics.  Mr. Korznikov assisted in arranging an 
information exchange on hostage rescue tactics between 
Alfa Group and the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, and is 
hoping to arrange for additional training for Alfa 
operators through U.S. contractor Blackwater. 
 
 
 
¶5. Recommendations: Post recommends Tactica Ltd., 
Moscow, Russia as reliable recipients of sensitive 
U.S. origin commodities.
