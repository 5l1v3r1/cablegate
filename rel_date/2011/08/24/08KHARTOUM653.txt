ESCALATES TO VIOLENT CONFRONTATION 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Violent clashes continue to flare along Sudan's 
north-south boundary, centering on the Abyei region.  On April 25, a 
skirmish between SPLA troops and a pro-NCP tribal force left a 
reported 20 casualties.  On April 28, a murder in the town of 
Kharsana escalated into a battle that left an unknown number of dead 
and the town blockaded.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Violent clashes along Sudan's north-south border continue, 
often escalating from apparently minor disputes into major battles. 
On April 25, SPLA troops battled a pro-NCP force near Payang, 
resulting in from 20-30 casualties, mostly among the Northern force, 
according to the SPLA.  The Northern force was following, and the 
SPLA believed planned to attack, a convoy of IDPs traveling to the 
South to participate in the census. (Note:  The Northern force has 
been described as "Misseriya," but this term seems often to be used 
generically in such incidents near Abyei.  This particular group was 
traveling in military vehicles, at least some wore uniforms, and may 
have been SAF-supplied Misseriya PDF or other militia or even SAF 
troops.  End note.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On April 28, a non-political court dispute in the town of 
Kharsana (NE of Abyei and North of Higlig in disputed territory) 
escalated dramatically following the murder of an ethnic Misseriya 
by an ethnic Nuer.  Fighting between the two groups resulted in an 
unknown number of casualties and the town of Kharsana, including the 
SPLA garrison, being blockaded by Misseriya tribesman and access to 
water cut off.  (Note:  The SPLA garrison includes ethnic Nuba, 
Nuer, and Misseriya soldiers.  It is not know how Misseriya SPLA 
troops reacted.  End note.)  SPLA sources allege that the SAF have 
been arming local Misseriya with heavier weapons and there also are 
unconfirmed rumors of direct SAF participation. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Prompt response on the part of local authorities appears 
to have calmed the situation somewhat and contained it, at least for 
now.  Southern Kordofan Governor Adam, Unity state Governor Taban, 
and GNU Minister of State for Humanitarian Affairs Ahmed Harun (who 
is also an ICC indicted suspect) traveled to Higlig to defuse the 
crisis.  Governor Taban reportedly agreed to withdraw SPLA forces to 
the south for two weeks.  The Misseriya agreed to end the blockade 
and allow access to drinking water.  The two governors also agreed 
to negotiate compensation for the dead. 
 
¶5.  (U) Kharsana lies north of the disputed border between Abyei and 
South Kordofan and is claimed by both.  On April 22, the first day 
of the national census, enumerators from South Kordofan were denied 
entrance to Kharsana by residents who apparently feared they would 
be counted as part of the "Northern" population and said that they 
should be counted by enumerators from Abyei.  (Note:  The 
enumeration boundaries laid out in census marking do not necessarily 
correspond to political boundaries, which has been a source of 
confusion and dispute in a number of areas.  End note.) 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment.  The April 28 incident reflects how a seemingly 
minor dispute can escalate dangerously in the current atmosphere of 
political tension over the north-south border.  Both the NCP and 
SPLM have been manipulating the situation for their own advantage 
and at the expense of the local populations.  If this pattern 
continues, some future incident could easily spiral beyond the 
ability of either side to contain. End comment.
