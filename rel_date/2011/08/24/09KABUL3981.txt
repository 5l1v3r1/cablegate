SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: ENGAGING COALITION PARTNERS TO QUICKLY 
REVIEW DRAFT MOU ON LIFE, SECURITY AND MOBILITY SUPPORT 
 
REF 3870 
 
¶1. This message contains an action request in para 4 
 
¶2. (U) Begin Summary. Embassy Kabul continues to engage with 
coalition partners with Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) to 
press for conclusion of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Life, 
Security and Mobility Support.  We understand coalition partner 
capitals are reviewing these agreements, and we have asked our PRT 
officers at coalition-led PRTs to urge coalition colleagues to press 
their foreign ministries for a quick turnaround.  Embassy Kabul 
requests that the Department instruct Posts in capitals of these 
coalition partners to engage with appropriate Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs officials to similarly highlight the importance of quickly 
concluding these agreements. End Summary. 
 
¶3. (U) Embassy Kabul is in the process of significantly increasing 
the number of USG civilians at Provincial Reconstruction Teams 
(PRTs) and other field locations.  Of the 27 PRTs in Afghanistan, 15 
are ISAF Coalition-led.  There are more than 50 U.S. civilians based 
at Coalition-led locations, and we hope to deploy many more in the 
coming months.  In order to facilitate this increase, we are trying 
to conclude MOUs that will support such deployments.  Currently, 
arrangements for accommodation and support of U.S. civilians at 
partner PRTs have been ad hoc and informal.  Several partners have 
asked for an MOU.   Assistant Chief of Mission Mussomeli recently 
met with ambassadors of all coalition countries that have PRTs in 
which the USG has or may seek to place civilians in the coming 
months (reftel).  He presented them with draft MOUs on Life, 
Security and Mobility, which were positively received.  A brief 
summation of the current status of negotiation of the individual 
MOUs is outlined below: 
 
-- U.K.: The latest version of the MOU is in the final stages of 
discussion.  Post expects to conclude discussions with UK colleagues 
in the next week. 
 
-- Norway:  The last contact with the Embassy was on November 30. 
The Norwegians report that the MOU was sent to Oslo, but there is no 
response yet. 
 
-- Sweden:  The last contact with the Embassy was on November 30. 
The Swedes report that the MOU was sent to Stockholm and is being 
processed. 
 
-- Germany:  The last contact with the Embassy was on December 10. 
The initial response from the German government was positive and 
included some technical questions from the Ministry of Defense that 
we are working through. 
 
-- Hungary:  The last contact with the Embassy was on November 18. 
The Hungarians reported that the MOU was sent to Budapest where it 
will need to be negotiated, rather than in Afghanistan. 
 
-- Canada:  The last contact with the Embassy was on December 3. 
The Canadians report that the MOU was sent to Ottawa and that 
comments would be returned to us on December 6 (as of December 10, 
Post had not received the comments).  Additionally, the PRT reports 
some initial concerns were raised by the Canadian PRT with the 
requirement to support three movements per day and will want to work 
on revised language on this point. 
 
-- The Netherlands:  The last contact with the Embassy was on 
December 4.  The Dutch report that the MOU was sent to the Foreign 
Ministry and Tarin Kowt for comments. 
 
-- Lithuania: The last contact with the Embassy was on December 4. 
The Lithuanians report that the MOU was sent to Vilnius for review. 
 
-- France:  The last contact with the Embassy was on December 4.

The French report that the MOU was sent to TF Lafayette and Paris 
for review on November 23.  The Embassy said that they have been 
very busy and have not had time to review the document but have not 
forgotten about it. 
 
-- Spain:  The last contact with the Embassy was on November 24. 
SCR-West Brad Hanson discussed with the Spanish PRT Commander on 
November 30 changes to be incorporated regarding the self-drive 
requirements.  Post RSO is considering revised language. 
 
-- Italy:  The last contact with the Embassy was on November 21. 
SCR-West Brad Hanson discussed with the Italian PRT Commander on 
November 30 changes to be incorporated regarding the self-drive 
requirements.  Post RSO is considering revised language. 
 
-- New Zealand: As New Zealand's diplomatic representation is based 
in Tehran, we will provide a copy of the agreement to the Embassy 
via email and via the PRT in Bamyan.  Additionally, it will be 
helpful if our mission in Wellington provides a copy of the 
agreement to the Foreign Ministry per the action request below. 
 
-- Czech Republic:  The last contact with the Embassy was on 
November 25.  As the Czech Republic does not provide support to U.S. 
personnel (and is located on a USFOR-A base), the MOU is not 
necessary.  The Czech Embassy reported that the MOU was sent to 
Prague for information. 
 
-- Poland:  The last contact with the Embassy was on November 24. 
As the Polish Government does not provide support to U.S. personnel, 
the MOU is not necessary.  The Polish Ambassador was provided the 
agreement for information. 
 
-- Turkey: As the Turkish PRT does not provide support to U.S. 
personnel, the MOU is not necessary.  We will provide a copy of the 
MOU to the embassy for its information. 
 
¶4.  (U) Action Requested:  Embassy Kabul recommends that Department 
instruct posts in the following countries to approach the 
appropriate officials in the host government Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to emphasize the importance of concluding the MOU. 
Countries to approach include: Norway, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, 
Canada, The Netherlands, Lithuania, France, Spain, and Italy. 
Additionally, Post requests that Embassy Wellington provide a copy 
of the draft MOU with New Zealand to the New Zealand Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs; the MOU will be emailed separately.  Recommended 
points are as follows: 
 
-- Our Embassy in Kabul recently presented your government with a 
draft Memorandum of Understanding on Life, Security and Mobility 
Support. 
 
-- This agreement, while not legally binding, would establish a 
framework for cooperation for support to U.S. civilians at coalition 
led Provincial Reconstruction Teams(PRT) or other bases. 
 
-- The MOU would establish a framework for cooperation for what have 
been until now largely ad hoc arrangements, and would provide a 
mechanism for USG payment to coalition partners for support services 
provided to U.S. civilians at PRTs or other bases. 
 
-- We understand that it will take some time to review the document, 
but we appreciate your expeditious review. 
 
-- We will be happy to pass any questions or concerns that you may 
have back to Embassy Kabul. 
 
¶5.  Post appreciates Department's assistance in this request.  POC's 
for questions or comments on the MOUs are Ann Marie Yastishock at 
Kabul/USAID and Patricia McNerney at Kabul/IPA.
