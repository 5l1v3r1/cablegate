SUBJECT: TIP: TURKEY REQUESTS INFORMATION ON 2007 TIP 
REPORT NETHERLANDS COUNTRY NARRATIVE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent us a 
diplomatic note on August 13 about the Netherlands country 
narrative in the 2007 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report, 
which contains a reference to Turkish men being trafficked to 
the Netherlands for purposes of forced labor. (See paragraph 
2 for unofficial translation of the dipnote.)  According to 
the dipnote, the Dutch MFA advised the GOT that the Turkish 
citizens mentioned in the report illegally migrated to the 
country and were working there (i.e., were not trafficked). 
Any information the Department or Mission Netherlands could 
provide us and that we could share with the GOT on the 
reported trafficking incident is appreciated. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) FULL TEXT OF MFA DIPLOMATIC NOTE (2007/KYGK/346969) 
(UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION) 
 
BEGIN TEXT.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic 
of Turkey presents its compliments to the Embassy of the 
United States of America and has the honor to state that in 
the Netherlands section of the 2007 TIP Report, by the U.S. 
State Department, there was a reference to Turkish men made 
victims of TIP by being forced into labor.  The Dutch MFA 
officials with whom we got in touch said they were not 
informed about the issue and that the Turkish citizens 
mentioned in the Report presumably arrived in that country 
illegally and were working there. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs avails itself of this 
opportunity to renew the assurances of its highest 
consideration to the Embassy of the United States of America.
