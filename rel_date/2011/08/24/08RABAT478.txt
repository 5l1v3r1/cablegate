ENDORSEMENT OF PROLIFERATION SECURITY INITIATIVE 
 
REF: RABAT 462 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Moroccan Foreign Ministry Secretary General Omar 
Hilale sent a letter to Undersecretary of State John Rood on 
May 19 underscoring Morocco's endorsement of the 
Proliferation Security Initiative.  It asks that we alert the 
GOM as to when we will announce this and looks forward to his 
attendance at the PSI 5th Anniversary meeting.  The letter, 
in addition to a diplomatic note 00461 (reftel), was sent 
under cover of a letter to Ambassador Riley.  Text follows: 
 
Begin Text: 
 
Dear Undersecretary of State, 
 
Following your letter dated April 21, 2008 and our phone 
conversations, I have the honor to confirm Morocco's 
endorsement of the Proliferation Security Initiative.  A note 
in this regard has been sent today to the Embassy of the 
United States of America in Rabat (see copy attached). 
 
The endorsement of this Initiative by Morocco reflects its 
strong commitment to the disarmament and the 
non-proliferation efforts. It should also strengthen 
cooperation between Morocco and the United States in terms of 
democracy, disarmament, and fighting against international 
terrorism. 
 
I am sure that this new decision will consolidate friendship 
relations that bind our two countries and will enhance their 
multidisciplinary partnership on the international scene. 
 
I would be grateful to you for keeping me informed, as 
agreed, of the date on which the Spokesman will announce 
Morocco's endorsement of the Proliferation Security 
Initiative. 
 
Finally, I would like also to confirm that I will be 
presiding over the Moroccan delegation to the Proliferation 
Security Initiative Fifth Anniversary events of May 21-29, 
2008 in Washington, D.C. 
 
While looking forward to meeting you at the end of the month, 
please accept, Mr. Undersecretary, the assurances of my 
highest consideration. 
 
Secretary General 
Omar Hilale 
 
End Text. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: It could be useful if a brief meeting, or 
at least a pull-aside, were to be arranged during the PSI 
events.  Post stands ready to facilitate or support as needed.
