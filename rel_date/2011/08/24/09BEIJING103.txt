Gaza Conflict 
------------- 
 
¶2. China is "gravely concerned" that UN Security Council resolution 
1860 is "not being implemented" in Gaza, said MFA Spokesperson Jiang 
Yu at the January 13 regularly scheduled MFA press briefing.  The 
resolution represents "the shared aspirations" of the international 
community.  China calls on all parties to implement a cease fire and 
on Israel to withdraw its troops.  China also "supports the efforts 
of Egypt and other mediators" to resolve the crisis, said Jiang. 
Since the start of the conflict, China's role has been 
"constructive." China's special envoy to the region Sun Bigan held 
talks with Egyptian and Arab League leaders.  China is also 
considering sending humanitarian assistance to the region, said 
Jiang. 
 
EU-China Relations 
------------------ 
 
¶3. China "attaches great importance" to its relationship with the EU 
and is committed to a "strategic partnership" with the organization. 
 Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi "exchanged views" with Czech Foreign 
Minister Karel Schwarzenberg on the importance of relations in a 
recent conversation, said Jiang.  Asked about China's relations with 
France, Jiang said that China "has always valued its relations with 
France" and has "never done anything to harm" the country.  However, 
the Tibet issue has "greatly damaged" relations and the image of 
France in the minds of the Chinese people.  France should "take 
seriously" China's concerns, "take constructive action" and create 
conditions for the improvement of bilateral relations, said Jiang. 
 
 
Internet Censorship 
------------------- 
 
¶4. Amnesty International's accusation that its website has been 
blocked in China due to the Chinese Government's apprehension 
regarding upcoming sensitive anniversaries was made "due to 
ignorance of China's situation," said Jiang.  China "takes an 
open-minded view" towards the Internet and "follows usual 
procedures" in managing it.  China could not have as many Internet 
users as it has if it did not have these policies, said Jiang. 
Websites that "advocate illegal things like cults" cannot be 
allowed, Jiang asserted.  Asked whether she could confirm whether 
Amnesty's website has been blocked in China, Jiang said she did not 
have specific information, but noted that "that organization is 
biased and not objective." 
 
AFM Hu Zhengyue trip to DPRK 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. Chinese AFM Hu Zhengyue visited the DPRK from January 9-12 "as 
part of normal exchanges," said the spokesperson.  While in the 
DPRK, Hu met with Foreign Minister Pak Ui Chun and Kim Yong Il to 
discuss the enhancement of friendship between the DPRK and China. 
Hu also discussed ceremonies commemorating the 60th anniversary of 
relations between the two countries which the spokesman predicted 
would be both "rich and colorful." 
 
Somali Piracy and Taiwan 
------------------------ 
 
¶6. China has sent ships to the sea off of Somalia following a UN 
 
BEIJING 00000103  002 OF 002 
 
 
Security Council resolution and the invitation of the Somali 
Government, said Jiang.  The Chinese ships will also protect 
merchant vessels from Taiwan. 
 
Foreign Minister Travels 
------------------------ 
 
¶7. Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi will visit Uganda, Rwanda, Malawi 
and South Africa from January 13-17 to "improve relations" with the 
four African nations and have an "in-depth dialogue."  Yang will 
visit Brazil from January 17-19 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of 
relations between the two countries.  Jiang noted that cooperation 
with Brazil will "help to increase [China and Brazil's] 
representation in the international sphere" Yang will also visit 
Portugal from January 20-21 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of 
relations. 
 
Cambodian King Illness 
---------------------- 
 
¶8. The spokesperson had not heard reports that Cambodia's former 
king Norodom Sihanouk has been hospitalized in Beijing but said that 
China "wishes him a happy life."
