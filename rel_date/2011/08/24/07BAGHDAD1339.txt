¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The head of the Zhinan Union of Kurdistan Women 
(ZUKW) told PRTOff that her organization supports the rights of 
Kurds to self-determination and freedom and the opportunity for 
women to exercise a broad range of civic and legal rights.  ZUKW, 
which operates at both the regional and national level, is supported 
by Iraqi public and international agencies. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On March 29, RRT Officer Mergy met with Kafia Suleiman, 
Founding Member and Head of the ZUKW, as well as Shawbo Askari, 
Public Relations Officer of ZUKW in their offices in Sulaimaniyah. 
The two ZUKW members said the organization had been successful in 
amending legislation to enhance women's rights, citing changes that 
no longer allow for reduced sentences for so-called "honor killings. 
"On July 16, 2005, the ZUKW submitted modifications for the draft 
Iraqi constitution to protect the rights of women.  However, ZUKW 
members note they have recently submitted additional amendments to 
be considered during constitutional review, for which they have not 
received feedback.   The second wave of recommendations is focused 
on adding an article to the introduction of the constitution to 
clarify that all articles apply to women, not just 14, 18, 20.  In 
addition, ZUKW proposed changes or deletions of the following 
articles: 2, 3, 4, 13, 29, 39, 40, 43, 44, and 71. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Suleiman and Askari explained that the ZUKW advocates 
peaceful means for conflict resolutions and prohibition on the use 
of weapons of mass destruction and of land mines.  They said that 
since 1989 the ZUKW has run a shelter for women that houses six to 
ten women on a regular basis.  The ZUKW also raises awareness of 
women with respect to medical issues and treatment as well as legal 
rights and sources of legal advice.  ZUKW has a wide range of 
programs designed to develop the role of women in education, art, 
health, and business, the two ZUKW members noted one project 
involves providing financial assistance to households headed by 
women in Koysinjaq so they can keep their honeycombs and livestock 
important sources of income, rather than selling them for food.. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to Suleiman and Askari, ZUKW has about 50,000 
members.  The Union is open to all women regardless of political 
affiliation.  It receives funding from Iraqi government sources, the 
UN and the UK government.   In addition, Jalal Talabani, Secretary 
General of the PUK and the President of Iraq, also provides support 
for ZUKW.  A new office building of the ZUKW in Sulaimaniyah is 
under construction and will include a guest house, handicraft area, 
sports facilities, media and printing facilities, and a nursery.
