NOMINATING-OFFICER: John Berry; Information Officer 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Mr. Ashraf Amin has been well known to the PA-Cairo for 
long years.  He has cooperated to publish Washington File 
scientific stories, in particular, out of personal 
interest, especially U.S. scientific, technological, 
environmental and medical developments and discoveries.  He 
also published several stories about different U.S. Embassy 
cultural functions, the most recent of which was "Circus 
Guy" due to its connection with science and environment. 
Ashraf's reputation as a diligent contributor to leading 
pro-government "Al Ahram" newspaper led to his recent 
promotion to be the head of its Scientific Section. 
Despite his long cooperation with the U.S. Embassy PA 
Section, he has never been to the U.S.   An IV program in 
the U.S. will be an ideal first-hand opportunity to boost 
his knowledge of the U.S., especially scientific 
developments, which would reflect on his work upon return.
