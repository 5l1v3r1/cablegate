SUBJECT: GERMAN MFA SHARES ITS OWN QUESTIONS, 
RECOMMENDATIONS ON DPRK UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW 
 
REF: STATE 123209 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff shared reftel points as well as questions and 
recommendations with MFA Human Rights Division deputy Martin 
Huth December 2.  Huth said that the MFA is "in full 
agreement with the points made" and also provided questions 
that the MFA sent to its Geneva Mission, see para 2.  Huth 
said whether their mission can put forth its 
questions/recommendations on December 7 is subject to the 
availability of speaking time since Germany currently only 
holds observer status in the UNHRC. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Begin, German MFA Questions/Recommendations: 
 
Question: 
There exists deep concern that children's right to life, 
survival and development continue to be violated.  CRC was 
particularly concerned about stunting, wasting and deaths of 
children resulting from severe malnutrition (para. 22 of the 
OHCHR compilation A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRK/2, refers to 
CRC/C/PRK/CO/4, paras. 23-24).  The Federal Republic of 
Germany would be interested in how the Democratic Republic of 
Korea has responded in order to address these issues. 
 
Alternate question: 
There have been worrying reports suggesting violations of the 
right to family life.  The Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea urged that measures should be adopted to facilitate 
family reunification (para. 34 of the OHCHR compilation 
A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRK/2, referring to A/HRC/7/20, para. 42).  He 
also noted that there remain various consequences of the 
Korean War of 1950-1953, which have an impact on human 
rights, for instance the issue of missing persons and the 
reunification of families separated by the war (para. 34 of 
the OHCHR compilation A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRK/2, referring to 
A/HRC/4/15, para. 59).  How has the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea followed up on these recommendations, 
particularly with regard to the issue of reunification of 
families separated by the war? 
 
Alternate question: 
Concerns have been expressed about the freedoms of religion, 
opinion and expression.  The Special Rapporteur noted that, 
while some religious ceremonies seem to be allowed, there are 
indications that practicing religion gives rise to 
persecution (para. 37 of the OHCHR compilation 
A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRK/2, referencing A/63/322, para. 4).  CCPR was 
concerned that the practice regarding the exercise of 
religious freedom does not meet the requirements of article 
18 of the Covenant (para. 37 of the OHCHR compilation 
A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRK/2, referencing A/56/2001, para 86 (22)). 
Germany would like to know how the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea is addressing the above concerns. 
 
Recommendation: 
The Federal Republic of Germany recommends to the Government 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
 
--in line with a previous recommendation made by the CRC to 
make every effort to reinforce protection of the right to 
life and development of children. 
 
--to adopt measures to facilitate family reunification as 
commended by the Special Rapporteur 
 
Germany further recommends to the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea to improve its cooperation with UN Human 
Rights Mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur and 
other special procedures, and allow access.
