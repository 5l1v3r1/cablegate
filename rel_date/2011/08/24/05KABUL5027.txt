SUBJECT: AFGHAN PARLIAMENT - ONE WEEK UNTIL INAUGURATION DAY 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: In the final week before Afghanistan's first 
Parliamentary Inauguration in 30 years, discussions among 
MPs are intently focused on who will take the "plum jobs" in 
the new National Assembly.  Despite skepticism among some 
partisan politicians in Kabul, both the Ambassador and USG 
PolOffs continue to expound the policy message that the USG 
is neutral in the race for Speaker and will neither support 
nor block any candidate.  The Embassy has been deeply 
engaged in meeting with MPs of all stripes, and is 
monitoring the USG-sponsored orientation training session 
for MPs that began December 10.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE GATHERING OF EGOS; THE BUZZ OVER SPEAKER 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Political energy in Kabul is rising to frenetic 
heights as newly-elected members of Afghanistan's first 
Parliament in 30 years meet to discuss the future of the 
Afghan National Assembly in the final week before 
Inauguration Day on December 19.  While many MPs are meeting 
each other in Kabul for the first time, others have been 
busy for weeks campaigning for the highly coveted seat of 
President (Speaker) of the Wolesi Jirga (WJ, Lower House of 
Parliament).  At local gatherings of politicians, talk is of 
little else. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The WJ Speaker race at this point still appears 
wide open.  Among the front runners are former President 
Rabbani, who may have the backing of President Karzai, and 
ex-Minister of both Interior and Education, Younus Qanooni, 
who lost to Karzai in last year's Presidential election. 
Meanwhile, the current speculation is that Professor 
Sigbatullah Mojadeddi will end up as the Speaker of the 
Meshrano Jirga (MJ, Upper House of Parliament) given that 
Pir Syed Gailani appears to have stood aside to allow his 
son Hamid Gailani to be named to the Upper House.  (NOTE: 
Hamid failed in his bid to be elected to the Lower House in 
Paktika Province. END NOTE.) 
 
USG REMAINS NEUTRAL, DESPITE UNIVERSAL DISBELIEF 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Despite the continuing insistence of numerous MPs 
that "other governments are backing their favorite Speaker 
candidates, so the US should too," the Ambassador and 
PolOffs continue to press the message that the US remains 
neutral in the race for Speaker.  Still, our insistence that 
this is a matter for the 249 elected representatives of the 
Afghan people is a message that no one here quite seems to 
believe.  Some, like Rabbani and Qanooni, have said verbally 
that they understand the US policy, while others simply 
refuse to accept it.  In Afghanistan, conspiracy and 
ulterior motives are a way of life. 
 
POLOFFS MAKE THE ROUNDS 
----------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Embassy PolOffs have met with large numbers of MPs of 
all stripes in recent weeks, from former communist officials 
to mujaheddin fighters to foreign-trained technocrats.  Some 
MPs are old friends who have been involved in Afghan 
politics for years.  Others are new politicians who have 
only entered the political landscape since the fall of the 
Taliban government in 2001.  The Afghan political game, 
however, remains constant, as power is bargained and 
brokered over lavish meals in private homes and at small 
gatherings in fancy restaurants. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: The week of orientation for MPs, which has 
been well attended by over 300 MPs, including such 
heavyweights as Mohaqqeq and Professor Sayyaf, is a perfect 
venue for continuing discussions about how Parliament will 
work and who will be Speakers.  This is a game that Afghans 
excel at, and the final outcome is still unknown.  END 
COMMENT.
