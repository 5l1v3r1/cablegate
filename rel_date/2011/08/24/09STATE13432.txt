SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - SYRIA 
 
¶1. This Travel Warning warns U.S. citizens of ongoing safety 
and security concerns in Syria.  American citizens are 
urged to consider carefully the risks of travel to Syria 
and to take adequate precautions to ensure their safety. 
This supersedes the Travel Warning for Syria issued on 
April 15, 2008. 
¶2. On multiple occasions throughout January 2009, thousands 
of Syrians protested in mostly government-orchestrated 
rallies against Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip. 
While these events were largely peaceful, in one instance a 
few hundred protestors challenged police lines outside the 
Egyptian Embassy in downtown Damascus and were dispersed by 
means of non-lethal force.  At least seven smaller-scale 
and non-violent demonstrations have occurred in central 
Damascus and other urban centers. 
¶3. On October 30, 2008, the Syrian Government allowed a 
large-scale demonstration in central Damascus to take place 
with the aim of protesting an alleged U.S. military action 
at the Syrian/Iraqi border that had occurred earlier that 
week. Security concerns related to the demonstration 
prompted a temporary closure of the U.S. Embassy for one 
day.  In response to the same alleged incident, the Syrian 
Government ordered the immediate closure of the Damascus 
Community School, the American Language Center, and the 
American Cultural Center on November 4, 2008.  They remain 
closed until further notice. 
¶4. On October 9, 2008, Syrian authorities raided Yarmouk 
refugee camp on the outskirts of Damascus and killed three 
terrorist suspects.  On September 27, 2008, a car bomb 
exploded in a southern suburb of Damascus in proximity to a 
Syrian intelligence installation, killing and wounding 
numerous civilians.  On August 3, 2008, a Syrian general 
was assassinated near Tartous.  On February 12, 2008, an 
explosion in the residential Kafer Soseh neighborhood of 
Damascus killed a senior Hizbollah operative.  In 
September, 2006, the U.S. Embassy in Damascus was attacked 
by terrorists armed with guns, grenades, and a car bomb. 
In February 2006, violent anti-western demonstrations 
resulted in significant damage to four embassies near the 
U.S. Embassy. 
¶5. A number of terrorist groups have offices in Syria. 
Since 1979, the United States has designated Syria a State 
Sponsor of Terrorism due to its support for organizations 
such as Hizbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. 
In addition, other extremist groups are present in Syria. 
These groups have the potential to be either the targets of 
or perpetrators of acts of violence. 
¶6. U.S. citizens who remain in or travel to Syria are 
strongly encouraged to register at the Consular section of 
the U.S. Embassy in Damascus or via the 
www.travel.state.gov internet based registration website, 
and to obtain updated information on travel and security in 
Syria.  Those registering should give due consideration to 
Privacy Act provisions and waivers.  Americans in Syria are 
reminded they should review their personal security 
practices, including exercising caution and taking prudent 
measures to maintain their security and that of family 
members.  These measures include being aware of their 
surroundings, avoiding crowds and demonstrations, avoiding 
loitering in areas with concentrations of people such as 
hotels, theaters, bus stations, and schools.  American 
citizens should keep a low profile, vary times and routes 
for all travel, and ensure their travel documents are 
current. 
¶7. Syrian officials do not notify the American Embassy when 
American citizens are arrested.  Syrian officials do not 
inform detained American citizens that they have the right 
to request consular access.  In detention/arrest cases, the 
U.S. Embassy usually learns of a detained American via 
third parties, such as relatives or friends of the 
detained.  In the event an American citizen is detained, 
 
STATE 00013432  002 OF 002 
 
 
he/she should continue to request consular access and the 
right to speak to the U.S. Embassy. 
¶8. The Syrian government is acutely sensitive when it comes 
to the security of its borders.  A passport and Syrian visa 
are required to enter Syrian territory.  Visas must be 
obtained prior to arrival in Syria from a Syrian diplomatic 
mission located in the traveler's country of residence. 
The U.S. Embassy is aware that some persons have been able 
to obtain visas at Syrian border crossings.  However, the 
issuance of a Syrian border visa is in no way certain, and 
the U.S. Embassy wishes to dissuade American travelers from 
attempting to enter Syria in this manner. 
 
¶9. Syrian Immigration services closely track foreign 
visitors, especially students.  Syrian Immigration has been 
known to deny re-entry to Syria even to Americans with 
valid dual- or multi-entry visas in their passports. 
Several Americans have been refused re-entry to Syria after 
spending weekends in Jordan or Lebanon.  The Embassy cannot 
assist Americans in gaining re-entry to Syria or in 
retrieving their belongings from Syria if they are denied 
reentry. 
¶10. U.S. consular personnel remain available to provide 
emergency information and services to American citizens. 
The U.S. Embassy in Damascus, Syria, is located at 2, Al- 
Mansour St., Abu Roumaneh.  The Embassy telephone number is 
(963) (11) 3391-4444, fax (963) (11) 331-9678, e-mail: 
acsdamascus@state.gov.  American citizens may register with 
the Embassy online by visiting 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs.  Additional 
information may be found on the Embassy website at 
http://damascus.usembassy.gov/ 
¶11. Updated information on travel and security in Syria may 
be obtained from the Department of State by calling 1-888- 
407-4747 within the United States and Canada or, from 
overseas, 1-202-501-4444.  Additional details can be found 
in the Department of State's Country Specific Information 
for Syria, and the Worldwide Caution, which are available 
on the Department's Internet website at 
http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶12. Minimize considered.
