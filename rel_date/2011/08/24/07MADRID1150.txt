¶1. (SBU) Polcouns and Poloff delivered reftel demarche on 
June 11 to officials in Spain's Ministry of Interior and 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  At the Ministry of Interior, 
Emboffs met with Angel Melchor Celada and Maria del Puy 
Zaton, senior advisors in the MOI section dealing with TIP 
and the primary authors of Spain's forthcoming national 
action plan, and with Maria Marcos Salvador, Director of 
Spain's Intelligence Center Against Organized Crime (CICO), 
who is the GOS' new information focal point for Spain's law 
enforcement efforts against human trafficking.  At the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Emboffs met with Deputy Director 
General for North America Jose Rodriguez Moyano, the head of 
the MFA's Human Rights office Fernando Fernandez-Arias, and 
US desk officer Bosco Gimenez.  All Spanish officials were 
pleased with the final version of Spain's country narrative 
and deemed it a very positive report.  They said they look 
forward to reading the translated version of the full report 
once it is posted in Spanish on G-TIP's website. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Polcouns said that Spain deserved its Tier 1 ranking 
this year, but cautioned that a country's efforts against TIP 
cannot remain static and that Spain must show appreciable 
progress in the future to retain its Tier 1 ranking.  Emboffs 
highlighted reftel A areas for improvement identified in the 
2007 TIP report and encouraged the GOS to finalize its 
national action plan to combat trafficking and continue and 
expand its demand reduction efforts.  Our MOI interlocutors 
told us that the draft of the national action plan was 
currently being finalized by the office of the First Vice 
President and should be out soon, although the arrival of the 
summer holidays might push back the release until the fall. 
Emboffs also discussed new criteria for the 2008 TIP report 
and encouraged the GOS to take measures to ensure that 
Spanish nationals deployed abroad as peacekeepers do not 
engage in or facilitate trafficking in persons.  Angel 
Melchor replied that Spain already has on the books stringent 
laws against this.  Finally, Emboffs expressed an interest in 
expanding our anti-TIP collaboration with the GOS to include 
conferences or roundtable events designed to share best 
practices in the fight against TIP. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On a separate note, we received more details on the 
contents of the national action plan at a May 25 TIP 
conference hosted by the Swiss and Spanish governments 
(Poloff was the only third country national invited to the 
event).  Rosa Maria Peris, Director General of the Women's 
Institute in the Spanish Ministry of Interior, said that the 
plan will include a "reflection period" of thirty days, 
during which TIP victims can decide if they want to assist 
authorities in prosecuting their traffickers.  Peris added 
that the plan will incorporate recent suggestions made by the 
Spanish Congress to improve social sensitivity, education, 
and training for TIP victims.  The plan is slated to be in 
force initially for three years (with periodic evaluations) 
and will call for further legislative reforms and improved 
coordination with Spanish civil society.  This initial plan 
will focus on trafficking for sexual exploitation, but 
Melchor and Zaton told us that once it is published, they 
will immediately begin work on a national action plan against 
forced labor trafficking.
