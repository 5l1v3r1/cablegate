¶1.  (SBU)  Econ Counselor and Dutch Econ Officer jointly 
demarched Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director for North 
America Ambassador Henryk Szlajfer per reftel instructions. 
Szlajfer stated that Foreign Minister Meller is considering 
attending the dinner on the evening of May 17 and the first 
hour of conference discussions on May 18.    However, to do 
this, the Polish Foreign Minister would have to cut short a 
long-planed visit to Helsinki.  The MFA therefore seeks 
assurances from the Netherlands that the dinner will be a 
high-level event and that EU Commission President Barosso, EU 
High Representative Javier Solana, and the Austrian, French, 
German, British and Turkish Foreign Ministers are actually 
attending.  Our Dutch colleague agreed to consult with the 
Hague to determine whether these individuals will be present. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In a separate conversation, an official of the 
Polish Economics Ministry told us that Economics Ministry 
Under Secretary Naimski, Poland's energy security 
point-person, would be willing to represent Poland at the 
rest of the conference if invited to do so by the Dutch.
