On September 28, center-left "Diario Siete (circ. 
23,000) ran an editorial entitled "Erase Israel from 
the map?"  Quote: 
 
"Mahmud Ahmadinejad, the new president of Iran, said 
yesterday that Israel `should be erased from the 
map'....  This is an obscene expression that can lead 
to the justification of genocide.... Whether for God, 
country, superior race, or the argument of a chosen 
people, fundamentalists are an affront to humanity ... 
and any doctrine that tries to validate genocide must 
be confronted by the international community as 
whole....  There can be no double standard on this. 
Just as humankind condemns the Holocaust, it also 
condemns the abuses committed by Israel against the 
people of Palestine....  The fundamentalist mentality 
is the main obstacle to long-lasting peace in the 
Middle East, which requires the co-existence of Israel 
and a Palestinian state....  We must encourage those in 
the Arab world who distance themselves from the stance 
of the new government of Iran, and those sectors in 
Israel who want to end the bloodshed."
