SUBJECT: GREAT LAKES: TALKING POINTS FOR JUNE 19 BRIEFING 
 
 
Â¶1.  USUN is instructed to deliver the following points during 
the June 20 briefing by the Special Envoy of 
the Secretary General for LRA Affected Areas. 
 
Begin points: 
 
-- I would like to thank the Special Envoy for his briefing 
on the state of the Juba Peace Process and the current 
activity of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). 
 
-- The LRA has been a threat to the people and the security 
of the Great lakes region for far too long.  Today, I would 
like to make two points: 
 
-- First, the LRA must end the war against innocent civilians 
that it has waged for 22 years and must stop being a threat 
to four countries -- the Congo, the Central African Republic 
(CAR), Uganda, and Sudan.  Recent abductions and ongoing 
training are indications that the LRA remains intent on 
fomenting both regional instability and the continuation of 
war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
 
-- The United States condemns the recent attack by the LRA 
against the Southern Peoples Liberation Army in Nbanga, as 
well as abductions and the ongoing attacks on innocent 
populations in the Congo, CAR, and Southern Sudan. 
 
-- The United States demands that the LRA put an end to its 
long history of war crimes and crimes against 
humanity, including gender-based violence, especially rape 
and other forms of sexual abuse; torture; mutilation; and 
the abduction and recruitment of children for use in armed 
conflict.  Since the LRA began its campaign of violence in 
1987, tens of thousands of people have been killed, up to two 
million have been displaced from their homes, and 
thousands of children have been abducted in the DRC, Central 
African Republic, Southern Sudan, and 
Uganda.  The LRA must stop committing these atrocities and 
release all children in their custody immediately.  We 
further stress that there can be no impunity for those who 
commit gross violations of human rights. 
 
-- Second, the leadership of the LRA must immediately sign 
the Final Peace Agreement and disarm and demobilize its 
members.  If they do not, they will bear sole responsibility 
for the failure of the Juba Peace Process and its 
consequences.  The LRA can no longer be allowed to operate at 
will in the region.  Only by working together can the nations 
of central Africa and the international community eliminate 
the threat posed by the LRA once and for all. 
 
-- Time is running out for the leadership of the LRA.  We 
must make it very clear to them that they must disarm and 
demobilize now or face the collective will of the 
international community.
