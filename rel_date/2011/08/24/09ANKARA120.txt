SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT 
FRIDAY, JANUARY 23, 2009 
 
In Today's Papers 
 
More Detentions under 'Ergenekon' Probe 
Media outlets report that on Thursday, 39 people were detained in 16 
provinces in the "11th wave" of Ergenekon detentions, 20 those 
arrested included police and military officers.  The head of the 
Turkish Metal Workers' Union, Mustafa Ozbek, poll researcher Erhan 
Goksel and the head of police special operations team were among the 
suspects taken into custody in the latest wave, in which one 
captain, three lieutenants, four non-commissioned officers, one 
police chief and eight police officers were detained.  Yesterday, 
police searched the offices of Avrasya TV, a 
nationalist-conservative channel in Ankara known for its an anti-AKP 
stance, which is owned by Mustafa Ozbek. 
 
Papers report union leaders, the main opposition CHP and detainees' 
relatives condemned the detentions for being part of a "suppression 
campaign."  "Trade unions have been silenced and media organizations 
have been intimidated," said CHP spokesman Mustafa Ozyurek.  "Turkey 
is fast becoming an empire of fear." 
 
Editorial Commentary on the Ergenekon Investigation 
 
Tamer Korkmaz wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "The deepening 
of the Ergenekon investigation demonstrates Turkish state 
institutions' determination to free themselves from American 
manipulation.  The U.S. and NATO created the structure behind 
Ergenekon, and the Turkish state is taking action to eliminate it 
accordingly." 
 
Hasan Cemal wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "As the Ergenekon 
investigation deepens, the Turkish military has yet to clean up its 
own backyard.  There can be no civilian democracy until the military 
stays away from politics and deals with corruption in its own 
ranks." 
 
Oktay Eksi wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "This investigation has 
become nothing less than a Turkish version of McCarthyism." 
 
TUSIAD Warns Government on Worsening Economy 
Media outlets report Arzuhan Dogan Yalcindag, the newly reelected 
the president of Turkey's elite business grouping TUSIAD, asked the 
government yesterday to take the "essential steps" to "improve the 
liquidity and awaken the demand" in order to overcome the ongoing 
economic crisis as soon as possible.  Yalcindag warned the 
government that the Turkish economy was at the point of a 
"standstill."   TUSIAD board member Mustafa Koc said, "Turkish 
society has still been dealing with the issues like the headscarf, 
the closure case, and the Ergenekon probe," and called on the 
government to "concentrate on the crisis." 
 
Poll: Parties Maintain Positions Ahead of Municipal Elections 
According to a public opinion survey carried on the front page of 
the Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak, political preferences of Turkish 
voters have not changed since the general elections held in July 
Â¶2007.  If parliamentary elections were held today, the distribution 
of the votes would be as follows: AKP 45.3 percent, CHP 21.4, MHP 
13.7, DTP 6.4, DP 3.0, SP 2.9, and others 5.1.  On the results of 
the forthcoming municipal elections on March 29, the survey projects 
the following distribution of votes: AKP 47.5 percent, CHP 23.1, MHP 
12.5, DTP 4.9, SP 2.7, DP 2.3, and others 5.1.  The survey indicates 
65.9 percent of the interviewees support Turkey's EU bid, while 34.1 
percent oppose.  The survey was conducted from January 9-19 by 
canvassing the views of 1903 people in the provinces of Istanbul, 
Ankara, Izmir, Bursa, Konya, Adana, Samsun, Trabzon, Diyarbakir, 
Kayseri, Gaziantep, Tekirdag, Erzurum and Malatya. 
 
"Gaza Tries to Return to Normal" (Taraf) 
Media outlets focus on the dire situation in Gaza after the 
withdrawal of Israeli forces.  Mainstream Sabah headlines, "The 
 
ANKARA 00000120  002 OF 003 
 
 
Aftermath of War in Gaza Means Hunger, Death, and Poverty." 
Mainstream Milliyet reports, "Children's Spirits Are Also Under the 
Rubble."  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak headlines, "Help From Hamas 
for the Oppressed," and notes "Hamas is paying every family who lost 
a loved one in the Israeli operations 1000 Euros."  Liberal Radikal 
reports, "Gazans Are Rebuilding the Tunnels," between Egypt and 
Gaza.  Islamist-oriented Zaman headlines, "For Palestinians, Being 
On Top or Underneath the Tunnels Means Death," as "1300 Palestinians 
were killed on the ground during the Israeli offensive," but "the 
tunnels are dangerous despite the fact that they are being used to 
only transfer food and medicine from Egypt." 
 
Jewish Lobbies are Disturbed by Increased Anti-Semitism in Turkey 
Mainstream Milliyet reports that five influential Jewish lobby 
groups in the US sent a letter to PM Erdogan calling on him to take 
action against rising anti-Semitism following Israel's incursion 
into Gaza.    The letter criticized anti-Semitic activities such as 
angry protests against Jews in front of Israeli diplomatic missions, 
anti-Jewish slogans on billboards in Istanbul, and boycotting 
campaigns against Jewish-owned companies.  The letter emphasized, 
"Jews in Turkey feel threatened and unsafe.  The statements made by 
government officials have contributed to the rise of anti-Semitism 
in Turkey.  We don't agree with your recent harsh comments." CNN 
Turk reports, "Jew lobbies are alarmed by Erdogan's (verbal) attacks 
against Israel."  Mainstream NTV notes, "The U.S. Jewish Lobby 
Sharply Criticizes Turkey," for "criticizing Israeli policy and 
stepping up anti-Semitism." 
 
Zebari in Ankara 
Mainstream Sabah reports that Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari 
came to Ankara yesterday for an official visit.  Zebari plans to 
meet with President Gul, PM Erdogan and FM Babacan today.  Sabah 
notes that Zebari came to Turkey within the framework of the 
mechanism for strategic dialogue between the two countries and will 
brief Turkish officials on the measures taken by Iraq to eliminate 
the PKK. 
 
"Obama Keeps His Word and Closes Guantanamo" (Vatan) 
Media emphasize President Obama is keeping his promises and changing 
direction in U.S. policy with the stroke of his pen.   Mainstream 
Hurriyet praises Obama for "Ordering Guantanamo Closed Within One 
Year," and "banning the CIA's use of torture methods in 
interrogations."  Mainstream Sabah headlines, "Obama Signs the Order 
to Lock Up the Torture Base."  Mainstream Vatan reports, "He Keeps 
His Word and Closes Guantanamo."  Liberal Radikal reports, "Obama 
Gives An End to Gitmo and Torture."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet 
reports Obama "Is Changing the Approach to the Middle East." 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports, "Obama Puts An End to Guantanamo" 
and "Bans Torture."  Leftist Taraf reports, "Obama Cleans Up Bush's 
Wreckage," and "after closing Guantanamo, Obama keeps his word and 
calls for a withdrawal from Iraq and changes the CIA's interrogation 
techniques." 
 
Meanwhile, mainstream NTV reports, "Like Bush, Obama Emphasizes 
Israel's Right to Defend Itself," as "Hamas Declares Obama Does Not 
Represent Change." 
 
President Obama and Inauguration Address 
 
Hasan Bulent Kahraman wrote in mainstream Sabah: "President Obama's 
address was very well-crafted and it appropriately reflected his 
values for hope and change.  Obama's approach will end Islamaphobia 
in America and anti-American sentiment around the world." 
 
Cengiz Candar wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal: "Obama's 
address was inspirational and provided global messages to 
politicians around the world.  We can only hope that Turkish 
politicians eventually understand the consequences of being on 'the 
wrong side of history,' as Obama put it." 
 
 
ANKARA 00000120  003 OF 003 
 
 
Ozgen Acar wrote in leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet: "Ambassador 
James Jeffrey faces some tough tasks.  Not only must he deal with 
the residuals of the Bush administration-designed 'Moderate Islam' 
project in Turkey, but he also has to face upcoming problems such as 
the Armenian genocide resolution.  Given Nancy Pelosi's commitment 
to the Armenian lobby and VP Biden's anti-Turkey reputation, there 
are some serious challenges ahead of him."
