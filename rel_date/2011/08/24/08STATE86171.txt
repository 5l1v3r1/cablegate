SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - GEORGIA 
 
¶1. This Travel Warning updates information on the 
current security situation in Georgia.  In light of the 
continued aerial bombings of civilian and military 
targets in several areas of the country, the Department 
of State warns U.S. citizens to defer non-essential 
travel to Georgia and recommends that all U.S. citizens 
depart Georgia. 
¶2.  American citizens who remain in Georgia despite this 
and earlier warnings are urged to continue to review 
their personal security situations, to take appropriate 
action to ensure their safety, and should consider 
relocating to a safe location.  Private Americans are 
encouraged to follow the precautions detailed below and 
to remain in close communication with the American 
Embassy in Tbilisi for more detailed information.  This 
Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning for Georgia 
issued August 8, 2008. 
¶3.  On August 10 and 11, two Embassy-coordinated convoys 
of American citizens departed Georgia for Armenia.  A 
third convoy, made up of buses and other vehicles, is 
scheduled for Wednesday, August 13.  American citizens 
interested in joining the convoy should call the 
consular section at 995-32-27-70-00, ext. 7137 or ext. 
7003, or 899-57-39-69.  The Consular Section of the US 
Embassy has suspended visa processing at this time, but 
is open 24 hours for American Citizens Services until 
further notice.  Peace Corps temporarily relocated 
trainees and volunteers to Armenia on August 11.  The 
Peace Corps office in Tbilisi remains open for business. 
At this time, Embassy personnel are unable to travel to 
western Georgia because of the security situation. 
American citizens in Georgia are advised to contact the 
U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi as soon as possible to register 
and provide information on their current situation. 
Americans in western Georgia are advised to depart the 
country if possible.  If safe departure is not possible, 
Americans in western Georgia are advised to remain in 
place and maintain contact with the consular section of 
the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi pending further guidance. 
¶4.  American citizens should monitor the U.S. Embassy 
website http://georgia.usembassy.gov and stay in contact 
with family and friends in the United States.  American 
citizens in Tbilisi may also tune in to Radio Syndicati 
at FM 104.3 or throughout Georgia at Radio Green Wave at 
FM 107.4 for updated U.S. Embassy warden message 
information. 
¶5.  Family members and friends unable to verify the 
safety and welfare of U.S. citizens in the affected area 
should call 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United 
States and Canada, or from other areas via a regular 
toll line at 1-202-501-4444. U.S. citizens in the area 
are urged to monitor the local news.  Those residing or 
traveling in Georgia are reminded to register with the 
U.S. Embassy either online at 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs or in person 
at U.S. Embassy Tbilisi so that they can obtain updated 
information on travel and security.  By registering, 
American citizens make it easier for the embassy to 
contact them in case of emergency. 
¶6.  The U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi is located at 11 George 
Balanchine Street (in Didi Dighomi), Tbilisi 0131, 
Georgia, tel: 995-32-27-70-00.  The after-hours 
emergency number is 995-99-57-39-69, or, if dialing 
locally on a mobile telephone, 899-57-39-69.

site at http://travel.state.gov, where the current 
Worldwide Caution, Travel Alerts, Travel Warnings, 
Country Specific Information, and health information
