SUBJECT: PROPOSED CRISIS MANAGEMENT EXERCISE (CME) 
 
REF: STATE 02049 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post would welcome the proposed Crisis Management 
Exercise for Manama, Bahrain during the 1Q of FY06.  However, 
due to a previously scheduled visit by the Office of the 
Inspector General, several Muslim holidays and two 
significant conferences that will include high-level U.S. 
delegations, post asks that any proposed training be 
restricted to October 25 (Tuesday) and October 26 or October 
29 (Saturday) and October 30. 
 
¶2. (U) Per reftel, paragraph 5, the following responses are 
offered: 
 
a) the Point of Contact (POC) for the proposed exercise is 
RSO Keith A. Swinehart. 
 
b) post has consulted with the Crisis Management Training 
(CMT) CMT website for detailed background information and 
pulled copies of relevant training materials for those staff 
scheduled to participate in the exercise. 
 
c) the RSO will review, update and reassign as appropriate 
the Emergency Action Committee (EAC) responsibilities as 
shown in post's Emergency Action Plan (EAP) prior to the 
start of the CME. 
 
d) post will examine all three readiness standards prior to 
the commencement of the CME.  This includes checking 
emergency medical and food supplies, testing emergency 
communications equipment and visiting post's alternate 
command center. 
 
e) post would prefer a joint tabletop exercise involving both 
Locally Engaged Staff (LES) and official American personnel. 
However, with the planned exercise taking place during 
Ramadan, any such plans would need to take into account the 
reduced hours of operation at the Embassy (LES staff 
departing at 1400 hours). 
 
f) post may be serviced by either FEDEX or DHL.
