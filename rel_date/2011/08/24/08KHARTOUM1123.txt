SUBJECT: MICHAEL MAKUEI AND THE SPLM ETHNIC BALANCING ACT 
 
¶1. (SBU) Beyond the increasingly standard array of agenda items 
linked to the SPLM/NCP relationship and the CPA's implementation, 
this weekend's SPLM Political Bureau meeting, the party's first 
since the National Convention, will focus mainly on neutralizing the 
constant threat to Southern stability posed by tribal politics.  A 
major consideration the Political Bureau will deal with is how to 
balance Southern tribal and ethnic considerations in filling 
significant vacancies within the GOSS, and how to craft a party 
nominating system whereby SPLM candidates are selected for what they 
can contribute politically, not what ethnic group they represent. 
Already, Kiir's attempts to effect a reshuffle purely on the basis 
of qualifications have been considerably impinged by repeated 
refrains from senior advisors and party elders such as Joseph Lagu 
to keep the SPLM and GOSS "balanced for the sake of a unified 
South." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Of particular significance in this ethnic balancing act is 
the fact that Minister for Legal Affairs and Constitutional 
Development Michael Makuei Lueth - a Dinka and chief architect of 
the CPA - is no longer a Political Bureau member.  Makuei stepped 
aside in order to make room for Minister for Industry and Mines (and 
leading Nuer negotiator) John Luk Jok.  With Jongelei State's 
remaining seats within the Political Bureau filled by Dinka from Bor 
town (Governor Kuol Manieng and Presidential Advisor for Gender and 
Human Rights Rebecca Garang), Makuei told ConGen Juba he felt he 
needed to take this action in order to refute those who "continue to 
grumble about Dinka domination of the party."  While generally 
respectful of the Vice President's standing as Vice Chairman, Makuei 
also acknowledged that Jok was a necessary counter weight within an 
SPLM leadership actively worried about the machinations of devious 
GOSS VP Riek Machar. "(Jok) can keep him in check, and not allow the 
Vice President to speak as if he represents all Nuers." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Makuei, at sixty-one, remains one of Sudan's foremost legal 
scholars and a valued counselor to SPLM Chairman Salva Kiir Mayardit 
- this despite his occasionally fierce criticism of decisions taken 
by Kiir's inner circle within the Presidency.  Kiir brought the 
minister into the SPLM's pre-ICC indictment Crisis Management Team 
meeting, changing the gathering's name so that Makeui could be 
included despite his lack of titular leadership status. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Makuei has said privately that he is not interested in 
running for office at any level during the 2009 elections, and 
admits he has angered local-constituency elders through his decision 
not stand to represent them again in the Southern Sudan Legislative 
Assembly. While likely too partisan for the NCP to accept on the 
National Elections Commission, his removal from the Political Bureau 
coupled with Kiir's need to keep him close has transformed Makuei 
into a presumptive appointee for the South's High Committee on 
Elections.  The High Committee is a far-less powerful and far more 
subordinate counterpart to the National Elections Commission. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: While unlikely that the GOSS will part with 
Makuei's services before 2011 regardless of his own feelings on the 
matter, should he be appointed to the High Committee, this entity's 
ability to keep Khartoum focused on South-specific timelines in 
advance of the elections will be significantly strengthened by the 
weight and negotiating experience he would bring to that body. His 
familiarity with NCP officials who negotiated the CPA would be an 
advantage as well.
