EFFORTS IN SUDAN 
 
¶1. (SBU) During courtesy calls by Charge d'Affaires (CDA) Whitehead 
June 16, the Qatari and Chinese Ambassadors both expressed strong 
support for current U.S. diplomatic efforts in Sudan.  Qatari 
Ambassador to Sudan Ali Bin Hassan Al-Hammadi told CDA that USG 
initiatives s to solve the problem of Darfur and facilitate CPA 
implementation will give the U.S. "a good face in the region" and 
greater respect in the Arab world.  Al-Hammadi avoided addressing 
specifics on the Doha peace talks on Darfur, but acknowledged that 
all political forces, including traditional leaders and civil 
society, should be incorporated in the Doha process. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Chinese Ambassador Li Chengwen also praised current U.S. 
diplomatic engagement.  He told the CDA that "stability and 
development should be most important above all considerations" in 
Sudan. He said that many fear a return to full-scale war if the 
South secedes.  He argued that the North/South problem is "more 
fundamental than Darfur."  Chengwen called for greater focus on the 
CPA and expressed support for the June 23 CPA Forum conference 
hosted by  U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan General Scott Gration, 
noting that the Chinese Special Envoy to Sudan would attend. 
Chengwen touted China's large contingents of peacekeepers in Sudan, 
including 315 UNAMID engineers and 475 UNMIS 
engineers/medics/specialists.  In addition, he said China plans to 
increase its development assistance to Darfur, as well as the size 
of its diplomatic presence in Juba. (NOTE: A Chinese company 
recently completed the new headquarters of the GOSS Legislature in 
Juba. END NOTE). 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: The Qataris are keen to facilitate a deal on 
Darfur to raise their regional political profile, as well as to 
secure their growing commercial interests in Sudan (primarily in 
agricultural schemes for the moment.)  The Chinese Ambassador's 
comments on development and security reflect his country's primary 
focus on economic interests rather than humanitarian concerns. END 
COMMENT.
