In Today's Papers 
 
FM Davutoglu Hopeful of a Peaceful Solution to Avoid Hot Pursuit 
All papers: Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu spoke to journalists 
Monday regarding the government's top foreign policy priorities. 
Davutoglu stressed that the EU and Cyprus are top priorities for 
Turkish foreign policy and he noted that the current and upcoming EU 
term presidencies (currently held by Sweden and then Spain and 
Belgium) is an opportunity for Turkey.  Regarding Cyprus, Davutoglu 
said, "The Talat-Christofias meetings are of critical importance. I 
think these talks are the last chance. I hope these talks would be a 
basis for a strategic peace in Cyprus." Regarding ties with the 
U.S., Davutoglu said, Turkey and the U.S. have parallel views about 
many regional issues and they two countries have established the 
necessary mechanisms for consultations, the improvement of these 
mechanisms would continue. Commenting on Turkish ties with Russia, 
the Turkish Foreign Minister says that Russia was not just a 
neighbor, but also a country sharing a number of common interests 
with Turkey in Eurasia. 
 
Davutoglu also said that Turkey was considering joint measures with 
Iraqi authorities that would avoid incursions into Iraqi territory 
to fight the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' party, or PKK.  "We hope 
that developments that do not require military solutions will take 
place in the near future," Davutoglu said, without going into detail 
of a so-called road map for a solution to the Kurdish issue. "Turkey 
is determined to take all measures to maintain security along all 
its borders. We hope in the near future developments do not require 
hot pursuits into neighboring territories. Most important is to set 
conditions to avoid cross-border activities," Davutoglu said at a 
breakfast with journalists in Ankara.  Despite recent reports in the 
Turkish media that implied the possible involvement of the PKK 
leader Abdullah Ocalan in the solution process with a declaration 
expected mid-August, Davutoglu pointed to the state mechanism to 
find a solution. "Turkey creates solutions with its own willpower. 
We have the Cabinet and the MGK [National Security Council] to 
discuss those issues. There is no need to search for another path," 
Davutoglu said.  He emphasized that, instead of sole military 
measures, Turkey would rather work on a comprehensive solution 
package that would both preserve the country's national unity and 
widen the scope of freedoms and democracy. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Davutoglu Comments 
Fikret Bila wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "Foreign Minister 
Davutoglu attaches great importance not only to his foreign policy 
framework but also to the way it is perceived by public opinion.  He 
believes a solution to the Kurdish problem can be found through the 
cabinet and the National Security Council, which basically rules out 
any involvement of the PKK's imprisoned leader." 
 
Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal: "Davutoglu made 
a careful analysis of Turkey's relationship with Iraq.  He 
characterized the relationship as 'a brotherhood by fate' which was 
very important.  Equally important is that he said there are no 
difference for Turkey between Baghdad and Erbil, and thus the 
Foreign Minister indicated that Ankara remains equidistant to all 
parties in Iraq." 
 
Mustafa Unal wrote in Islamist oriented Zaman: "Foreign Minister 
Davutoglu highlighted the importance of the normalization of 
Armenia-Azerbaijan relations which he considers as 'a national 
matter for Turkey and compatible with Turkey's interests.' 
Davutoglu mentioned that the normalization process between Turkey 
and Armenia also continues and there is a possibility for some 
progress before the Turkey-Armenia football match in October. 
Stating Turkey's will to solve problems, Davutoglu says the opening 
of Turkey's border with Armenia and a solution to the Nagorno 
Karabakh dispute are not alternate matters to each other." 
 
Erdal Saglam wrote in Hurriyet: "It was an example of populism when 
Davutoglu commented that Turkey's interference and reaction in 
 
ANKARA 00001039  002 OF 003 
 
 
international affairs, such as the China/Uighur crisis was welcomed 
by Turkish people 'because Turks want to see Turkey interfering and 
this is a healthy thing' as he put it.  This is not the right 
approach.  Just like with economic policies, once you begin shaping 
policy according to populism, there is a strong chance of failure in 
the long term." 
 
According to DTP, Solution for the Kurdish Issue is Close 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports that mainly Kurdish 
opposition party DTP decided to evaluate the road map for the 
solution of the Kurdish issue to be announced by jailed PKK leader 
Abdullah Ocalan and also to send the report they prepared on the 
same issue to Imrali where Ocalan is serving a life sentence.  DTP 
deputy Sirri Sakik said "Ocalan's road map should not be evaluated 
with prejudices.  We are very close to a solution." 
 
President Gul Orders Supervision of Forensic Science 
Sabah, Hurriyet, Milliyet, Radikal, Zaman, Cumhuriyet and other: 
President Gul ordered the State Supervisory Council to supervise 
Forensic Science Institute that made controversial decisions on 
several publicly sensitive issues.  President Gul took action 
following several negative reports about the Institution. Mainstream 
Milliyet reports that State Supervisory Council will investigate 
activities of the institute for the past three years. 
 
Trilateral Mechanism Corners the PKK 
Mainstream Milliyet reports that Turkey is close to settlement in 
talks with the U.S. and Iraq for ending PKK presence in northern 
Iraq.  Milliyet reports the parties made major progress in the talks 
after the northern Iraqi Kurdish Administration was included in the 
talks.  The paper notes that the parties are preparing to implement 
a project for ending PKK activities in Northern Iraq and the 
contacts between FM Davutoglu and Baghdad have started to produce 
results.
