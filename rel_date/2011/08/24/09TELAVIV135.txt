REF: TEL AVIV 0121 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Only the Kerem Shalom crossing was open on January 
16; it handled 76 truckloads of supplies and three fuel 
tankers.  In the wake of yesterday's firefight around the 
UNWRA compound in Gaza and destruction of its main warehouse, 
UNWRA did not operate its usual cargo convoys from Kerem 
Shalom to Gaza City.  UNWRA is still assessing the extent of 
its losses at its Gaza City compound.  Apart from a few sacks 
of flour and the fuel tankers, everything else in the 
warehouse was destroyed, including the blankets USAID had 
procured from OFDA. The IDF discouraged NGO/IO north-south 
movements between Gaza City and the Rafah crossing on January 
¶16.  If UNWRA restarts its convoy operations on Saturday, the 
GOI has committed to open Kerem Shalom, otherwise it will be 
closed as is normal on Saturdays.  The Karni crossing was to 
have been opened on January 16, but mechanical problems with 
the conveyor resulted in nothing being sent through to the 
Gaza side.  Karni, too, could be opened on Saturday if the 
conveyor has been repaired and trucks are available on the 
Gaza side to move product.  Fuel storage on the Gaza side of 
Nahal Oz remains nearly full, so the GOI did not open Nahal 
Oz on January 16.  It does not intend to open Nahal Oz on 
Saturday. 
 
¶2. (SBU) ICRC has ceased escorting foreign evacuees in the 
face of mounting criticism from Gazans that such efforts 
detract from meeting the urgent needs of Gazans who have no 
place else to go.  Embassy Tel Aviv secured UNWRA agreement 
to assist with evacuation of foreigners from Gaza, provided 
that the evac could be done as part of the daily cargo convoy 
from UNWRA's Gaza City compound to Kerem Shalom.  Embassy has 
also started the ball rolling with Shin Bet and MOD to secure 
a GOI decision to permit our remaining FSNs in Gaza and their 
families to be evacuated to the West Bank.  Emboffs met with 
JCR Chief Baruch Spiegel afternoon of January 16, accompanied 
by USAID and UNWRA reps, to secure his support for a Kerem 
Shalom evacuation.  Spiegel is willing to help, but used the 
occasion to encourage UNWRA to consider running a combined 
cargo/evac operation directly through Erez. UNWRA leadership 
still fears that delay in moving through that crossing makes 
its convoys a target for Hamas mortar or rocket fire.  The 
last effort to run an UNWRA cargo convoy through Erez ended 
with an UNWRA driver being killed by Israeli tank fire. We 
expect a decision from UNWRA on the Erez option late evening 
of January 16.
