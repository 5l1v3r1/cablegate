SUBJECT: NORTHERN UGANDA: GOU PULLS OUT OF JUBA PEACE PROCESS 
 
REF: KAMPALA 1552 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: The Juba Peace Process has ended after Lord's 
Resistance Army (LRA) leader Joseph Kony refused to sign the Final 
Peace Agreement (FPA) on November 30.  On December 1, Government of 
Southern Sudan (GOSS) Mediator Riek Machar, UN Special Envoy for 
LRA-Affected Areas Joachim Chissano, and the delegations from the 
LRA and the Government of Uganda (GOU) took stock of the peace 
process. Uganda's delegation leader, Minister of Internal Affairs 
Ruhukana Rugunda, said that it was clear that Kony was not 
interested in peace and that the GOU would no longer participate in 
the current peace process.  Rugunda kept the door open for LRA 
delegation leader David Matsanga to come to Kampala for discussions 
at any time.  Chissano may brief the UN Security Council (UNSC) 
on/about December 16.  He will not recommend that his mandate, which 
expires on December 31, be extended.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) GOSS Mediator Riek Machar called a meeting with UN Special 
Envoy Chissano, the GOU delegation, and LRA delegation leader, Dr. 
David Matsanga, on December 1.  Machar acknowledged that Kony's lack 
of interest in the peace agreement made it difficult to continue the 
process, but offered suggestions for keeping the channels of 
communication open, including the possibility of another meeting on 
December 28, a unilateral Ugandan Government signature on the FPA, 
and partial implementation of the agreement (reftel). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Rugunda told Machar that the GOU was not interested in 
continuing the current process given Kony's failure to sign the 
peace deal, according to Warner Ten Kate, the head of Chissano's 
Kampala Office.  Rugunda added that the GOU would keep the door open 
for discussions with the LRA and offered to host Matsanga at any 
time.  Machar stated that he would report the outcome of the latest 
attempt to meet Kony and the GOU's desire not to pursue more 
meetings to GOSS President Salva Kiir.  Machar speculated that Kiir 
would then put an end to his role as mediator of the process. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Ten Kate reported to P/E Chief on December 2 that Chissano 
was not surprised that the GOU had decided to end the current 
process.  Chissano reportedly believes that without military 
pressure on Kony, he would not sign the peace deal, according to Ten 
Kate.  Chissano flew back to Uganda with Rugunda and planned to meet 
President Museveni on December 2.  Chissano hopes to brief the UNSC 
on December 16 and deliver his final report.  Ten Kate stated that 
Chissano will not seek a renewal of his mandate, which expires on 
December 31. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment: In Uganda, the initial public reaction has been 
decidedly against Kony for failing to sign the peace deal, with many 
northerners calling for Uganda's "Plan B", a military option against 
the LRA.  The Government, which appears to be conducting policy on a 
day-by-day basis, has not thoroughly thought through the 
implications of the end of the Juba phase of the process, with the 
exception of proposing consultations with other regional leaders.
