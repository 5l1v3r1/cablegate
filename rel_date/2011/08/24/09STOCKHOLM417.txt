SUBJECT: RWANDAN GENOCIDE SUSPECT TO BE EXTRADITED FROM 
SWEDEN 
 
Minister of Justice Beatrice Ask announced on July 8 that 
Sylvere Ahorugeze, a Rwandan national, will be extradited 
within three weeks to Rwanda, where he is suspected of having 
been one of the leaders of a Hutu extremist group involved in 
the genocide.  Ask said that Sweden is the first European 
country to extradite a suspected genocide criminal to Rwanda. 
 Sweden's Supreme Court ruled that the Rwandan justice system 
has made great improvements to its legal system and there is 
nothing in Swedish or European law that prevents such a 
suspect from being extradited.
