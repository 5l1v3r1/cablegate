SUBJECT: FRENCH INTEREST IN IOSEA (TURTLE) MOU 
 
 
1.(U) Following receipt of a query from NOAA and OES, ESTH 
Officer met separately in January with Mr. Stephane Louhaur, 
MFA Directorate of environment, and Ms. Martine Bigan, 
Ministry of Ecology, both responsible for marine life and 
oceans international issues, to discuss French views on 
whether France might consider signing the IOSEA MOU (Indian 
Ocean Southeast Asia Memorandum of Understanding) for marine 
conservation. 
 
2.(U) Both French officers indicated that the French 
Government was positively disposed to the MOU, however, they 
are awaiting views from the EU.  According to these officers, 
France had officially requested EU views some three years ago 
noting French interest in the IOSEA MOU.  To reinvigorate 
this initiative France has recently sent a reminder to 
responsible officials in the DG environment in Brussels, who 
according to the Ecology Ministry are in favor of the MOU, 
reminding them of the previous letter.  Mr. Louhaur 
cautioned, however, that the GOF is unsure when a reply will 
be received.  The Emabassy plans to re-contact both the MFA 
and Ecology Ministry in due course to pursue this matter 
again.
