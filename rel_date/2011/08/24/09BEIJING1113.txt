SUBJECT: IRANIAN OFFICIAL ADDRESSES BEIJING AUDIENCE ON 
NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  A visiting Iranian Atomic Energy Agency 
official told an invited audience of some 30 PRC government 
officials, Chinese academics, and foreign diplomats 
(including PolOff) April 23 that Iran considered the 
attainment of nuclear energy a main policy goal, and argued 
that sanctions implemented over the past 30 years had forced 
Iran to develop its own nuclear technology.  Outlining 
various projects related to Iran's nuclear program, the 
official dismissed concerns that Israel might attack Iran's 
nuclear facilities, and argued that Iran's current stock of 
7,000 centrifuges was low by the standards of other nations 
that possess nuclear power.  Iran was open to negotiation 
with the E3-plus-3, he said, but the grouping had to 
recognize Iran's right to produce nuclear fuel and 
technology.  Iran had expressed willingness to engage in 
dialogue with the United States, but only if the United 
States "modifies its position" on Iran.  Allowing IAEA 
inspectors into Iran's nuclear facilities was beyond its 
obligations under the NPT, the official said.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Deputy head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Agency 
Mohammad Saeedi spoke to an audience of some 30 PRC 
government officials, Chinese academics and foreign diplomats 
(including PolOff) April 23 at the MFA-affiliated China 
Institute for International Studies (CIIS) on the topic of 
"Iran's Policy on the Nuclear Issue."  Attendance was by CIIS 
invitation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In his prepared remarks, Saeedi stressed the need 
for nuclear energy to meet Iran's industrial and agricultural 
demands, and said that international cooperation was a 
necessary part of Iran's nuclear energy development.  The 
Iranian government considered nuclear energy a main policy 
goal, according to Saeedi.  He argued that sanctions 
implemented over the past 30 years had forced Iran to develop 
its own nuclear technology. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Outlining Iran's nuclear facility development plans, 
Saeedi said the reactor in Bushehr should be active in six to 
seven months.  Iran was also working on a 40-megawatt (MW), 
heavy-water research reactor, domestically designed and 
built, that would be operational within two years, Saeedi 
said.  In constructing this heavy-water reactor, Iran had 
used a Chinese design but with modifications that were 
necessary because of sanctions.  Iran aimed to construct a 
5000-MW nuclear power plant with international cooperation 
and through international tenders, and was currently 
designing a 360-MW light-water reactor with indigenous 
companies and experts.  Both facilities would be completed 
within 9-10 years.  Saeedi said that Iran was working on a 
suitability study for a 20,000-MW nuclear power plant, the 
location for which had yet to be determined, which Iran hoped 
to complete in the next 30 years.  Saeedi also mentioned that 
Iran was working on a 2,360-MW nuclear power plant, also 
using only indigenous technology and experts, but provided no 
other details.  (Note:  Saeedi's presentation on the nuclear 
facilities was disorganized, with Saeedi often not clearly 
identifying which projects he was discussing.  End note.) 
Saeedi argued that Iran had been forced to develop its own 
nuclear fuel capacity because of the unreliability of 
international fuel suppliers. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Asked about concerns that Israel might launch an 
attack against Iran's nuclear facilities, Saeedi dismissed 
the concern, arguing that Iran had worked with the 
international community to define its pursuit of a peaceful 
nuclear energy program. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Asked why has Iran recently dramatically had 
increased the speed and scale of centrifuge installation 
despite international opposition, Saeedi argued that Iran's 
current stock of 7,000 centrifuges was low by the standards 
of other nations that possess nuclear power.  He also claimed 
that Iran had the right to produce nuclear fuel under the NPT. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Responding to a question about whether Iran would 
cooperate with the E3-plus-3, Saeedi said that Iran was open 
to negotiation with the group, but that the E3-plus-3 had to 
recognize Iran's right to produce nuclear fuel and 
technology.  On talks with the United States, Saeedi said 
that President Ahmadinejad had announced Iran's willingness 
to engage in dialogue, but only if the United States 
"modifies its position" on Iran. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Asked whether Iran would allow IAEA inspectors into 
its nuclear facilities, Saeedi argued that Iran was 
cooperating with the IAEA within the framework of the NPT, 
but that the IAEA request went beyond Iran's NPT obligations.
