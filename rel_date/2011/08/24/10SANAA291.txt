REF: SANAA 211 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  In a February 1 meeting with the 
Ambassador, UNHCR Representative Claire Bourgeois described 
recent developments in ROYG policy towards both Ethiopian and 
Somali refugees as reflecting an attempt by the ROYG to begin 
controlling an ever-increasing refugee population. Bourgeois 
asked the Ambassador to help facilitate the return of DHS 
circuit-ride teams to Yemen in order to conduct interviews of 
potential refugee resettlement candidates.  Bourgeois also 
requested help in securing additional funds for food aid for 
the UNHCR-run Kharaz refugee camp.  Although recent ROYG 
policy changes towards refugees are a step in the right 
direction, hasty implementation could lead to more problems 
for both Yemen and its refugee population in the future. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
CHANGES IN ROYG REFUGEE POLICY AND ARRIVAL TRENDS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a February 1 meeting with the Ambassador, UNHCR 
Representative Claire Bourgeois expressed concern over recent 
cases in which Ethiopian arrivals have been detained by ROYG 
officials and then deported before being interviewed by UNHCR 
regarding eligibiltiy for refugee status.  Bourgeois said 
that recent discussions with the ROYG have focused on gaining 
access to these individuals and finding a way to recognize 
more as refugees. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Bourgeois believes that the increasing number of 
deportations is part of a larger ROYG policy shift on 
immigration and refugees.  According to Bourgeois, Dr. Ali 
Muthana, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and chairman of the 
National Committee for Refugee Affairs (NCRA), said that 
official ROYG policy towards Somali immigrants will change 
but &they are in no hurry8 to implement these changes until 
an effective system is in place.  Muthana said changes will 
possibly include scrapping universal prima facie refugee 
status for all Somali arrivals to Yemen and granting it only 
to those from certain unstable regions within Somalia; all 
other arrivals would have to claim asylum.  Another potential 
change would include limiting the freedom of movement for 
Somali refugees once they arrive. Muthana said that these 
changes will not affect those currently in Yemen, but only 
new arrivals.  Refugees currently in Yemen are required to 
register with the ROYG by March (reftel). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Bourgeois stated that there has been a noticeable 
decrease in the number of arriving Somalis this January 
compared to a year ago at the same time.  (Note: Although 
January's numbers are down from the previous year, overall 
refugee arrivals in 2009 saw an increase of 55 percent 
compared to 2008 arrivals.  End Note.)  She attributed the 
recent decrease to the increased strength of authorities in 
the autonomous northerneastern region of Puntland, Somalia 
and to the large-scale arrests of smugglers in Obock, 
Djibouti. (Note: Puntland and Obock are the main departure 
points for Horn of Africa refugees arriving in Yemen. End 
Note.)  Finally, Bourgeois believes that the market for 
smugglers may have decreased as word spread among the Somali 
population that, rather than making their way to the more 
desirable Gulf states, most refugees remain in Yemen. 
 
UNHCR REQUESTS ASSISTANCE FROM THE U.S. 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Bourgeois asked the Ambassador for help facilitating 
the return of DHS circuit-ride teams to screen possible 
resettlement candidates to Yemen.  (Note: The DHS 
circuit-ride teams are responsible for interviewing refugees 
that have been prescreened by UNHCR and its partners and 
determining eligibility for resettlement in the U.S.  End 
Note.)  Historically, these visits were done bi-annually and 
lasted approximately 10 days.  However, visits by these teams 
have been restricted due to ongoing security concerns in the 
country.  The last visit aimed at screening Somali refugee 
candidates took place in July 2008.  According to UNHCR, 
there are 572 persons who have been prescreened and are 
awaiting an interview with DHS.  Bourgeois noted that the 
places available for resettlement from Yemen are extremely 
limited and that the cases in question represent those with 
the most compelling needs.  She added that delays in the 
resettlement process add to feelings of hopelessness and 
frustration in the refugee community. (Note: The U.S. is the 
 
SANAA 00000291  002 OF 002 
 
 
primary recipient of refugees from Yemen through the U.N.'s 
resettlement process.  End Note.) Bourgeois emphasized the 
fact that future cancellations of DHS circuit-ride teams will 
only increase tensions and significantly hinder UNHCR,s 
resettlement efforts in Yemen.  (Note: Post is currently 
working with DHS to restart the circuit-ride teams.  DHS has 
submitted March 20-29 as tentative dates for the next visit 
through the regional refugee coordinator.  End Note.) 
 
¶6. (SBU) Finally, Bourgeois expressed concern over the 
continuation of food aid to the UNHCR-run refugee camp in 
Kharaz, outside of Aden.  The World Food Program (WFP) 
projects that due to lack of funding, the amount of food aid 
it will be able to distribute will decrease by 50 percent per 
person from its original amount as of March 1, 2010.  She 
asked for any assistance the Embassy could provide.  The 
Ambassador told Bourgeois that he would discuss the 
possibility of additional emergency assistance for WFP with 
the USAID mission director. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Recent changes to the government's refugee policy 
in Yemen - such as requiring registration, considering 
suspending prima facie refugee status for Somalis and 
restricting refugee movement in Yemen - appear to be part of 
a broader security strategy on the part of the ROYG to 
control its borders and increase stability within the 
country.  Although these steps are promising, hasty 
implementation without a clear system in place to handle the 
sheer number of refugees could be disastrous for the refugee 
community.  It is also unclear if the ROYG, burdened by so 
many other pressing economic and political concerns, is 
either willing or able to tackle the complicated and 
potentially sensitive issues surrounding its buregeoning 
African refugee population.  END COMMENT.
