SUBJECT: ROYG ASKS FOR ANTI-PIRACY SUPPORT 
 
¶1. Deputy Prime Minister for Defense and Security Affairs 
Rashad al-Alimi chaired an ambassadorial level meeting on 
September 10 to urge international support for the ROYG's 
anti-piracy efforts.  Joining al-Alimi were the Ministers of 
Defense, Interior and Transport.  He emphasized the 
importance of establishing a joint regional piracy reporting 
center in Aden and called for additional money and equipment 
from donor countries to support Yemen's stressed maritime 
resources.  Yemeni Coast Guard Chief BG Ali Raasa asked for 
more patrol ships and help to expand Coast Guard stations. 
Yemen will host the next International Maritime Organization 
conference in October and a November meeting to develop a 
plan to deliver support to regional actors. 
 
¶2. COMMENT.  The meeting seemed designed to convey the 
message that, its limited resources notwithstanding, the ROYG 
is prepared to take the lead to coordinate the international 
effort to combat piracy in the Gulf of Aden. If Yemen is to 
become an effective leader, however, the ROYG will need help 
to strengthen its other anti-piracy resources rather than 
relying so heavily on its well-financed, but already 
overburdened, Coast Guard.  END COMMENT.
