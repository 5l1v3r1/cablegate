REF: SECSTATE 118934 
 
(SBU) We delivered reftel points to MFA Latin America Head of 
Department Ece Ozturk-Cil November 12; she was aware of the 
situation but had no substantive response.  Turkey has 
limited bilateral relations with Bolivia and no embassy in La 
Paz.  USDEA has a 46-year presence in Turkey supporting 
regional counter-narcotic efforts.  The GOT is a valuable 
partner and regional leader in counter-narcotics efforts.
