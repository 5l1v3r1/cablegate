SUBJECT:  COTE D'IVOIRE: AMBASSADOR'S DECLARATION FOR 
FY07 REVALIDATION OF CONTINUING DISASTER 
 
¶1.  During the last year, both disarmament of former 
combatants from the 2002 rebellion and the 
identification and registration of voters failed to 
materialize.  As such, Cote d'Ivoire remains divided 
into three parts: the government-held south, the rebel- 
held north, and the UN controlled Zone of Confidence 
(ZOC) separating the two.  Currently, there are some 
13,000 peacekeeping troops in Cote d'Ivoire, including 
about 9,000 with the UN Operation in Cote d'Ivoire 
(ONUCI) and 4,000 with the French Licorne forces. 
 
¶2.  The decision to prolong President Gbagbo's mandate 
for up to 12 months beyond October 31, 2005 did not 
lead to the expected elections by October 2006.  The 
United Nations Security Council on November 1 endorsed 
an extension of President Gbagbo's term in office for 
up to one more year in order to allow for elections to 
be organized. 
 
¶3.  The western region of Cote d'Ivoire is still highly 
volatile.  Militias remain strong despite disarmament 
initiatives.  In January 2006, in the town of Guiglo, 
host to camps for refugees and internally-displaced 
persons (IDPs), pro-government militia orchestrated a 
wave of anti-UN violence, causing several deaths and 
widespread damage and resulting in the withdrawal of 
the UN forces posted there.  ONUCI and UN forces in 
Liberia (UNMIL) have been conducting joint patrols 
along the Liberia-Cote d'Ivoire border to prevent arms 
trafficking and the recruitment of Liberians into local 
militia groups. 
 
¶4.  Nationwide, business activity and living standards 
are declining and the poverty level reached 41% in 
¶2006.  A toxic waste dumping scandal in September 2006 
further exacerbated political tensions in the country, 
and protests and strikes occur frequently in Abidjan 
and elsewhere in Cote d'Ivoire.  The provision of basic 
social services to the general population remains very 
low, especially in the north, west, and in the ZOC. 
 
¶5.  Given these developments and their negative impact 
on the welfare of the civilian population, I request a 
continuation of USAID/OFDA's foreign disaster 
assistance in Cote d'Ivoire for FY 2007.
