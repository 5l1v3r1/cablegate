SUBJECT: NMFS CHIEF HOGARTH SEEKING ICCAT CHAIRMANSHIP: 
DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
Â¶1.  (U)  On November 8, ESTH Officer delivered talking 
points contained in REFTEL to Julien Turenne, Chief of the 
Bureau of Resources and International Affairs at the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Fish.  Mr. Turenne understood 
the points delivered, and explained that GOF has no 
objection to Mr. Hogarth's bid for chairmanship of ICCAT nor 
to the fact that were he to be elected, two Americans would 
hold chairmanship positions.  However, GOF considers its 
position "delicate," as the decision is ultimately that of 
the EC, which was to have met November 13 to decide on the 
chairmanship questions. HOFMANN
