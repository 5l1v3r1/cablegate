REF: SECSTATE 17022 
 
¶1. (SBU) On 15 February, Poloffs communicated reftel points 
to MFA Deputy Director (International Organizations) Amb. 
Rallis.  Rallis inquired which nations had previously 
contributed to the Distinct Entity Trust Fund.  Poloffs 
responded per reftel paragraph 5.  Rallis further inquired 
whether U.S. considered the amount of contribution or the 
symbolism of contribution more valuable.  Poloffs responded 
that while participation in and of itself was appreciated, 
per reftel paragraph 1 the DETF finances would soon be 
exhausted and without contributions a real crisis would soon 
exist. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rallis stated his intention to recommend to GoG FM 
Bakoyannis, MFA SyGen Rocanas, and MFA DirGen (Political) 
Vassilopoulos that the GoG make a new contribution of at 
least the same value as previous GoG contribution (500,000 
EURO).  Embassy will follow up with appropriate officials.
