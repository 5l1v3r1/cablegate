¶1.  (U) This telegram contains an action request.  Please see 
paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Holy See MFA Country Director for Israel Monsignor 
Franco Coppola raised the Vatican's concerns about freedom of 
movement for pilgrims to Bethlehem December 5.  Coppola claimed 
that while people staying in Jerusalem could easily leave the 
city to go to Bethlehem, there were often interminable delays 
when trying to reenter Jerusalem.    He said that under the 
current circumstances pilgrims with hotel rooms in Jerusalem 
would find it difficult to make a day trip to Bethlehem and make 
it back for the night. Coppola said he understood that security 
was important, but wondered if more personnel could be added to 
checkpoints to make travel more feasible.  He noted the upcoming 
Christmas season would only increase the number of people 
wishing to visit Bethlehem. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Though we understand the Holy See is raising this 
point directly with the government of Israel, Post would 
appreciate any information Department or ConGen Jerusalem has on 
this issue so that we can relay it to the Vatican MFA.  We are 
keeping the Holy See informed of the Department's statements 
supporting freedom of movement and access.
