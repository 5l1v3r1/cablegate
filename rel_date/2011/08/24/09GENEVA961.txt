1.(SBU) Summary - Charge was approached today both by General 
Council (GC) Chair Matus and the Israeli Ambassador.   It appears 
that we stand a good chance of managing the November 17 session of 
the GC successfully but only if the Israeli Ambassador receives new 
instructions on the issue of Ministerial Conference observer status 
by tomorrow.  However, there is also a new nomenclature issue for 
which we need Washington guidance soonest. End Summary 
 
¶2. (SBU) Matus told Charge that he is not inclined not to place the 
issue of GC observer status on the agenda for the November GC 
meeting.  However, he is certain that someone else will do so unless 
we settle the issue of MC observership and he is still a bit nervous 
that the Egyptians might do it on their own regardless of what 
happens on the MC.  The signals that Matus has received from the 
Israeli's thus far have not been encouraging. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Israeli Ambassador called Charge this morning to 
discuss the same issue.  Charge told him that it looked like we 
could head off the GC observership issue at the November GC, and 
ensuing potential fallout at the MC itself, if we could secure 
agreement on MC observer status. He responded that his current 
instructions were to object to MC observer status.  However, he 
indicated that he thought there was a possibility to change this and 
he wondered what would be the optimal time for such a change. 
Charge strongly urged him to seek fresh instructions by tomorrow 
when the GC agenda closes. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Regarding nomenclature, Matus told us that the PA is 
insisting that they be seated at the MC as "Palestine" as opposed to 
the "Palestinian Authority".  At the Hong Kong MC 4 years ago 
Members agreed to observer status under the latter title but when 
they arrived they insisted that their name plaque be changed to the 
former.  The Secretariat told them this would not be possible. 
Please advise soonest what our stance is on this issue and what this 
might mean in terms of Israel's acceptance of MC observer status. 
 
¶5. (SBU) There has also been a bit of a shift as to the type of 
observer status they want for the MC.  It seems that the PA has 
realized that arguing that they want a decision for this and future 
MCs undercuts their position that they must be a GC observer by the 
time of the next MC, in which case they would receive MC observer 
status automatically.  Hence, they only want a decision on MC 
observer status for the upcoming meeting, though they still have an 
allergy to the term "ad hoc".  This should be manageable.
