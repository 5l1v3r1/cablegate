SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT -- COMMONWEALTH ACTIONS ON 
ZIMBABWE; HARARE 
 
 
¶1.   UNDER HEADLINE "DANGEROUS TO LET ZIMBABWE OFF THE 
    HOOK AT THIS STAGE," THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY 
    NEWS" DEDICATED ITS FEBRUARY 1 EDITORIAL TO CAUTIONING 
    THE COMMONWEALTH ABOUT ITS DECISION NOT TO EXPEL 
    ZIMBABWE FROM THE ORGANIZATION. EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   ". . . AT ONE LEVEL, THE CMAG DECISION TO HOLD OFF 
    THE SUSPENSION COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS, EMBOLDENING 
    ZANU PF INTO A COCKINESS THAT MIGHT TRANSLATE INTO THE 
    ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE OPPOSITION AND OTHER 
    DETRACTORS.  AT ANOTHER LEVEL, THE DECISION COULD FORCE 
    ZANU PF TO SHOW ITS TRUE INTENTIONS.  IF THE PARTY IS 
    BEING HONEST WITH THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE EUROPEAN 
    UNION (EU), THEN THE VIOLENCE AGAINST THE OPPOSITION 
    SHOULD END IMMEDIATELY.  IF IT DOESN'T END, THEN 
    EVERYBODY, EVEN THE NIGERIANS AND THE SOUTH AFRICANS IN 
    THE COMMONWEALTH. . .MUST KNOW THAT MUGABE HAS ONCE 
    AGAIN PULLED THE WOOL OVER THEIR EYES.  THE BOTTOM LINE 
    FOR THIS FLURRY OF ACTIVITY IS THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL 
    ELECTION SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY FREE AND FAIR. . . ."
