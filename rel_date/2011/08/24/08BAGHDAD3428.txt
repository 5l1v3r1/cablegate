LEGISLATION; NEXT STOP, ACCESSION 
 
REF: A. 07 STATE 162259 
     ¶B. STATE 95569 
 
¶1. (SBU) After long administrative delays, legislation 
authorizing the Government of Iraq to accede to the 
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, 
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their 
Destruction (Chemical Weapons Convention - CWC) was published 
in the Official Gazette October 20.  The instruments of 
accession have been prepared and required declarations were 
shared with U.S. Embassy The Hague in July. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The CWC legislation, passed by the Council of 
Representatives in November 2007 and signed by the Presidency 
Council in December 2007, had been languishing at the 
Ministry of Justice awaiting publication in the Official 
Gazette, a requirement for the enactment of legislation. 
With its enactment, the Iraqi National Monitoring 
Directorate, the National Authority for the non-proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, may proceed with the 
submission of the instruments of accession to the 
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the 
United Nations.
