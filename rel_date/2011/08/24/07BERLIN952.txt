SUBJECT: GLOBAL INITIATIVE TO COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM: 
GERMANY RECEIVES INFORMATION REGARDING THIRD MEETING IN 
KAZAKHSTAN, 11-12 JUNE 2007 
 
REF: STATE 58978 
 
¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs officer and Russian Embassy Deputy 
Political Counselor Dmitri Cherkashin jointly delivered ref 
information to Joerg Polster of the German MFA's Division for 
International Energy and Nuclear Energy Policy May 4. 
Polster thanked us for the information and said he would pass 
it to other German officials. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Polster queried us about the mechanism for joining 
the Global Initiative (GI), to which Cherkashin and Emboff 
answered that essentially all member countries of the IAEA 
were offered the opportunity to endorse the Statement of 
Principles and join GI activities.  Polster voiced concern 
about so many countries endorsing the Statement of 
Principles.  He said that while it is easy to manage a group, 
it becomes more complicated the larger the group is.  He also 
noted that meetings become longer when more members are 
involved.  Emboff noted that no one can predict how many 
countries will join, but that if Germany has any input into 
the organization of the GI, now is the time to offer it when 
the GI is still forming. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Polster suggested that the U.S. and Russia invite 
the EU Commission to GI activities, at least as an observer. 
Polster noted that only the EU Commission has the necessary 
competencies for some nuclear issues in the EU.  He also said 
that the EU Commission has funds that could be made available 
for GI activities, whereas individual EU member states might 
be unable to fund GI events on their own.  Polster said the 
EU Commission is preparing a paper on its competencies to 
share with the USG and Russia concerning membership in the 
GI.  Emboff and Cherkashin said that their respective 
governments would need to study the Commission paper before 
making any decisions. 
 
¶4. (SBU) To emboff's query on Germany's outreach efforts with 
other EU member states that have not yet endorsed the GI 
Statement of Principles, Polster said that Germany had urged 
Spain and Portugal to join and that both countries appear 
close to joining.  Cherkashin noted that Germany, as the EU 
President, is in a position to influence other EU member 
states to endorse the Statement of Principles. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Concerning Germany's representation at the Astana 
meeting, Polster said that nothing had been decided on the 
head of delegation yet, but he expected MFA Commissioner for 
Economic Development and Sustainable Development Viktor 
Elbling to lead the delegation, as he did for the February GI 
meeting in Ankara. 
 
¶6. (U) Post will report any other significant German response 
to the GI meeting septel.
