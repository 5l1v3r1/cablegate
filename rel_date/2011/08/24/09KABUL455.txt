Islamic Republic of Afghanistan 
 
Presidential Decree on Upcoming Presidential, Wolesi Jirga, 
Provincial Councils, District and Municipalities Elections 
 
 -- Pursuant to the provisions of the articles no. 63 and 64 
of the Constitution  of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan 
(IRA) on protecting the Constitutions and ensuring its 
implementation as the supreme law of the country; 
 
 -- To preserve stability and legitimacy of the state; to 
institutionalize democracy based on the will of the Afghan 
people; to strengthen national institutions; 
 
-- To strengthen national unity and safeguard the crucial 
achievements that Afghanistan has made during the last seven 
years both at the national and international level; 
 
-- Based on the decision no. 3, 02/02/2009, of Wolesi Jirga 
on the holding of the presidential election; 
 
-- Based on the broad consultations with political and jihadi 
figures, scholars, lawyers and government officials; and 
considering the arguments brought forward by the Independent 
Election Commission and the challenges that Commission is 
faced with, I approve the following: 
 
   Article 1 
 
The Independent Election Commission shall conduct the 
presidential, Wolesi Jirga, provincial councils, district 
councils and municipalities, elections according to Articles 
33, 61, 83, 138, 140 and 141 of the Constitution of the 
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and shall make essential 
arrangements to ensure the conduct of a transparent, fair, 
free, general, secret and direct ballot election. 
 
Article 2 
All three powers of the state of Afghan security forces 
including the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Defense, 
Directorate of National Security and other government 
institutions are obliged to provide the required assistance 
to eliminate the challenges and difficulties that the 
Independent Election Commission is faced with. 
 
Article 3 
All the people of Afghanistan, including men and women, 
scholars, spiritual leaders, intellectuals, teachers, tribal 
elders, political parties, civil society organizations, media 
and other individuals and organizations have national and 
religious responsibility to endeavor for conducting safe, 
fair, free and general election, and prefer national 
interest, national unity and national sovereignty over 
personal, partisan, ethnic and tribal interests; cooperating 
with the Independent Election Commission and government 
organizations, actively participate in the elections; 
cautiously prevent visible and invisible interference and 
intervention by the enemies; and secure a bright future for 
our beloved country Afghanistan. 
 
Article 4 
Since the elections determine the future of the country, and 
electing and being elected is the right of every Afghan based 
on Sharia law and the Constitution of Afghanistan, I urge all 
opponents of the government to participate in the forthcoming 
elections through casting their votes or nominating 
themselves, especially in the insecure areas of the country, 
extending their support to the organizers of the election in 
this broad national effort. 
Hamid Karzai 
President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
