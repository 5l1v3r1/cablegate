¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  The El Fasher DPA Implementation Office opened 
officially on September 17.  Fully staffing the Peace Secretariat, 
guiding its operation, and maximizing its potential role in 
facilitating implementation activities are challenges that must be 
confronted in the weeks ahead.  END SUMMARY.

El Fasher DPA Implementation Office Opens 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Roughly one month following the official opening of the 
Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) Implementation Office (also known as 
Peace Secretariat) in Khartoum (reftel), the African Union (AU) 
inaugurated a parallel office in El Fasher on September 17.  Roughly 
forty persons attended the event, including members from the 
Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and National Intelligence and Security 
Services, North Darfur government officials, SLA-Minawi and other 
DPA/Declaration of Commitment (DOC) signatories, UN officials, NGO 
representatives, AMIS and AU personnel, civil society leaders, local 
press, and USG officials. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
AU Notes Long Road Ahead in Implementing DPA 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Active Response Corps (ARC) Officer moderated the ceremony, 
introducing the keynote speakers.  AU Deputy Head of Mission 
Ambassador Hassan Gibril delivered opening remarks, noting the long 
process that culminated in the DPA and, perhaps, the longer road 
ahead in implementing the accord.  He thanked a number of 
individuals and organizations that contributed to the establishment 
of the DPA, expressing particular gratitude t the U.S. Government 
for its financial, technical, and human resource support. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
GNU, SLM/Minawi Cite Backing for DPA, Need for Peace 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶4. (U) Standing in for the Wali of North Darfur, State Minister of 
Humanitarian and Social Affairs Ahmed Saleh Ahmed emphasized the 
GNU's backing for the DPA and its hopes for peace in Darfur.  (Note: 
 The Wali's absence was not unexpected, according to AU officials. 
Also present at the ceremony was the Humanitarian Affairs 
Commissioner (HAC), who frequently serves as the State government's 
interface with the international community, and SAF representative 
to the Ceasefire Commission General Abdullah Mubarak.  End note.) 
On behalf of the SLA-Minawi faction, Adam Ali War spoke 
extemporaneously in English about the significance of the Peace 
Secretariat and its potential value in aiding implementation of the 
 
SIPDIS 
DPA.  Like previous speakers, he thanked the U.S. Government for its 
extensive support of SLA-Minawi and the peace process and 
underscored the importance of gaining the buy-in of non-signatories 
to the peace agreement.

DCM Powers Underscores USG Role in Supporting DPA 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶5. (U) Finally, U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Roberto Powers 
delivered remarks highlighting the U.S. Government's role in the 
Darfur peace process and our continued commitment to improving the 
humanitarian situation in the region.  He congratulated the DPA 
signatories for their willingness to work toward peace, and 
articulated the U.S. position in support of UN Security Council 
Resolution 1706.

Comment

¶6. (SBU) While the DPA Implementation Office is fully equipped, 
funded through the end of the year, and ready to be occupied, it may 
take some weeks for the Office to find its niche.  The AU reports no 
progress in its appeals to Addis Ababa to provide at least two 
political affairs officers to staff the relevant "desks" in the El 
Fasher Peace Secretariat.  Ambassador Gibril's civilian political 
staff currently consists of only two individuals, who are frequently 
occupied with administrative or representational tasks rather than 
focusing on political, humanitarian, or security developments. 
These officers are unlikely to be capable of devoting the energy or 
time necessary to effectively advance the mission and role of the 
DPA Implementation Office.  The UK media team (DPA outreach) arrived 
several weeks ago in El Fasher, and will work out of the new office. 
 Production problems with a number of DPA products (e.g., 
illustrated explanations of the DPA) have delayed their strategic 
communications timeline, though the Peace Secretariat stands to fill 
an important function in hosting outreach events and coordinating 
 
KHARTOUM 00002348  002 OF 002 
 
 
the implementation efforts of various stakeholders. 
 
¶7. (SBU) The AU continues to consider an "Implementation 
Coordination" concept paper provided by ARC Officer last month; to 
date, there have been no meetings in El Fasher of the AU-led DPA 
Implementation Team (DPAIT), despite repeated exhortations by ARC 
Officer.  It also remains unclear who the SLA-Minawi faction will 
nominate to be its representative for the Peace Secretariat, 
indicating to ARC Officer that it is looking for guidance from its 
leadership in Khartoum.  Encouraging the AU to take ownership, 
initiative, and charge of the DPA Implementation Office and pushing 
the other signatories to fully participate will remain a challenge 
in the weeks ahead.  END COMMENT.
