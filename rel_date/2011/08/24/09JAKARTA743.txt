¶1.  President Yudhoyono convened an emergency cabinet meeting on 
April 27 and instructed authorities to take immediate measures to 
prevent the spread of swine flu to Indonesia.  Measures include 
halting imports of pork, expanding the bird flu pandemic 
preparedness program, and surveillance of the country's pig farms 
and regions that consume large amounts of pork.  In Bali, the animal 
husbandry agency has begun checking the bio-security systems of 
local farms and has asked farmers to notify them of any sick pigs. 
 
¶2.  Indonesian ports and airports also went on high alert Monday. 
Health offices at seaports have "reinforced" checks on passengers 
from abroad.  Airport officials report that they have installed 
thermal scanners to check body temperature at international arrival 
gates in Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.  They say that all 
incoming passengers must be checked, not just those from Mexico and 
the U.S. 
 
¶3.  Health officials claim that hopsitals are stocked with 
oseltamivir antiviral drug in order to treat potential infections. 
The Jakarta Health Agency indicates that the city's community health 
centers are stocked with the necessary drugs, and urges anyone with 
flu-like symptoms to seek medical advice immediately. 
 
¶4.  Embassy officials are meeting daily with key Indonesians and 
monitoring Indonesia's precautions closely.
