SUBJECT: SPAIN ON SUPPORT FOR MALI AND COMMUNITY OF

REF: STATE 129764 
 
¶1. (U)  Poloff spoke with Juan Manuel Linares, Spanish Deputy 
Director General for the United Nations, October 2 about 
Spanish support for the Community of Democracies and 
specifically for Mali's effort to organize a successful 
Ministerial meeting in November.  Linares said that of course 
Spain is a strong supporter of and has participated in the 
Community of Democracies since the first conference organized 
by Secretary Albright in Praque.  Linares said Spain will do 
what it can to support Mali's effort with the Ministerial, as 
Mali is an important Spanish neighbor and potential leader in 
Africa.  Linares noted, however, that Spain has only just 
opened its embassy in Bamako and currently has only one 
diplomat in Mali, such that Spain could provide little in the 
way of logistical support.  Linares was still waiting for a 
readout of Mali's October 1 meeting in New York on the 
program and agenda, but he undertook to discuss the issue 
further with the Embassy going forward. 
 
¶2. (U)  On Spanish support for the UN Democracy Fund, Linares 
noted that Spain contributed USD one million in 2006, USD 1.3 
million in 2007 and will give more in 2008.
