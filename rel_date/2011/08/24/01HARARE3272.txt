SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ABUJA LAND AGREEMENT; HARARE 
 
 
¶1.   THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE FINANCIAL GAZETTE" USED 
   ITS NOVEMBER 1 EDITORIAL TO URGE THE GOVERNMENT OF 
   ZIMBABWE TO SUPPORT THE ABUJA LAND.  UNDER HEADLINE "THE 
   WAY FORWARD," THE PAPER COMMENTS: 
 
¶2.   "NOTHING COULD BE MORE TRAGIC FOR ZIMBABWE THAN THE 
   DELIBERATE MISINFORMATION BEING PERPETUATED BY THE 
   GOVERNMENT AND ITS SYCOPHANTIC MEDIA THAT HARARE HAS 
   COMPLIED WITH ABUJA AND MUST THEREFORE BE GIVEN FUNDING 
   FOR THE LAND REFORMS.  THE ABUJA LAND PACT IS VERY CLEAR 
   ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND BY WHOM: THE ZIMBABWE 
   GOVERNMENT MUST IMPLEMENT THE ACCORD FIRST AND THEN BE 
   REWARDED WITH FUNDING FROM BRITAIN AND OTHER 
   INTERNATIONAL DONORS AND NOT THE OTHER WAY ROUND. . . 
   THE KEY ELEMENT OF ABUJA, WHICH HAS RIGHTLY ALSO BECOME 
   THE UNDERLYING CONCERN OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE 
   EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND THE UNITED STATES, IS THE 
   RESTORATION OF THE RULE OF LAW IN ZIMBABWE.  IT IS CLEAR 
   THAT ONCE THIS HURDLE HAS BEEN OVERCOME, ALL OUTSTANDING 
   ISSUES IN ZIMBABWE - THIS INCLUDES THE RESOLUTION OF THE 
   LONG-FESTERING LAND CRISIS - WILL SIMPLY FALL INTO LINE 
   WITHOUT ANY MORE PROBLEMS.  NOT ONLY WOULD FUNDING FOR 
   THE AGRARIAN REFORMS BE FORTHCOMING ONCE THE RULE OF LAW 
   IS ADDRESSED BUT THE LAND REDISTRIBUTION SCHEME WOULD 
   NOW BECOME LEGAL AND TRANSPARENT, THUS FULFILLING THE 
   OTHER CONDITIONS SET BY ABUJA, THE EU AND THE 
   U.S. . . ."
