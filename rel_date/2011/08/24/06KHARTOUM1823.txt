SUBJECT:  SUDAN/DARFUR:  SLM/MINAWI ANNOUNCES BOYCOTT OF CFC 
MEETINGS, LISTS LITANY OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST AU 
 
REF:  Khartoum 1806 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary and action request:  Growing tensions between AMIS 
and SLM/Minawi, due to the latter's allegations of lack of support, 
have led to an SLM/Minawi boycott of Ceasefire Commission (CFC) 
meetings.  A fracture between SLM/Minawi and AMIS could only serve 
to further exacerbate an already deteriorating security situation in 
Darfur.  AU rep Kingibe told a group of donors last week that, 
because the AU had been accused of "favoring" SLM/Minawi, he would 
cease logistical support (ref).  AMIS has been stung by comments in 
the field that it is no longer neutral with regard to the 
non-signatories, who, AMIS believes, still need to be wooed into 
supporting the agreement. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Action request:  We would appreciate a read from AF and L 
with regard to what logistical support AMIS is politically and 
legally obliged to support to the one rebel signatory.  We will no 
doubt have to help resolve this impasse.  End summary and action 
request. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a meeting with ARC field officer on July 28, UNDSS El 
Fasher conveyed his growing concerns regarding AMIS-SLM/Minawi 
tensions.  UNDSS displayed copies of a number of SLM/Minawi 
documents requesting support (mostly airlift) from AMIS and 
recounting how this support was either never delivered or not 
provided in a coordinated manner.  SLM/Minawi requested transport of 
members to Kulkul (North Darfur) on several occasions and, with the 
request going unfulfilled, later set a "deadline" of July 30 for 
AMIS to demonstrate its support.  At the July 26 CFC meeting, it was 
announced that SLM/Minawi is henceforth boycotting CFC meetings due 
to lack of support from the AU. 
 
¶4. (SBU) UNDSS also described some of SLM/Minawi's other 
requests/demands: 
 
-- The AU should clearly define its position with respect to DPA 
non-signatories and those that signed the Declaration of 
Commitment; 
 
-- SLM/Minawi wants additional AMIS support and an "apology" from 
the AU for its "bungled" transportation efforts; 
 
-- The AU should take SLM/Minawi claims more seriously; 
 
-- AMIS should transport all SLM/Minawi reps to the sector sub-CFCs 
to El Fasher on July 30; 
 
-- SLM/Minawi observers should be allowed to carry their own weapons 
(NFI), because AMIS security cannot be guaranteed; 
 
-- SLM/Minawi believes AU is "supporting" the NRF (apparently 
because they believe the AU is buying into the National Redemption 
Front's (NRF) information campaign against SLM/Minawi); 
 
-- The AU is not listening in Tawila and unresponsive to support 
requests; and 
 
-- The AU is not promoting the Darfur Peace Agreement.
