¶2. During the January 29 regular MFA press briefing, spokesperson 
Jiang Yu said a U.S. delegation led by EAP/K Director Sung Kim will 
arrive in Beijing on Wednesday and will meet with MFA officials. 
China considers progress made so far in the Six-Party Talks to be 
"hard-won" and "worth treasuring."  Relevant parties should maintain 
patience and take initiatives to implement the spirit of the 
agreements, Jiang stated. 
 
Reported Visit of Kim-Jong Il 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. Questioned about a press report of a potential March visit by Kim 
Jong Il to China, Jiang stated that the Chinese Communist Party and 
the Worker's Party of the DPRK maintain friendly exchanges.  She 
made no comment on the possibility of a visit. 
 
Hu Visit to Japan 
----------------- 
 
¶4. When asked for China's position regarding China-Japan relations 
ahead of President Hu Jintao's visit to Japan, Jiang said that 
China-Japan relations are in an "important period of improvement and 
development."  China hopes to work with Japan to implement the 
consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries to deepen 
cooperation in various fields. 
 
¶5. Responding to a reporter's question about the East China Sea 
issue, Jiang said that China is willing to work with Japan to adopt 
a positive and sincere attitude to maintain the momentum of 
consultations.  As China and Japan improve bilateral relations, 
China hopes to solve this issue at an early date.  Jiang said that 
both China and Japan are important in the East Asian region and 
shoulder the same responsibilities with regard to international 
peace. 
 
Weaponization of Outer Space 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6. In response to a question regarding a possible joint Russia-China 
proposal on the prevention of the weaponization of outer space, 
Jiang said that China supports the peaceful exploration of outer 
space and is opposed to the weaponization of space.  China has not 
nor will it ever engage in the weaponization of outer space.  Jiang 
stated that China actively supports the Disarmament Conference in 
Geneva and hopes to arrive at an international legal document 
through negotiations. 
 
Olympics and Human Rights 
------------------------- 
 
¶7. In response to a question regarding whether China has lived up to 
the commitments made in support of its Olympics bid, Jiang stated 
that China's position on this subject is clear.  China opposes 
efforts to politicize the Olympics.  This is contrary to the spirit 
of the games, and the international community should oppose efforts 
to disrupt the event.  China has made progress to improve the rights 
of its citizens to voice their concerns in line with China's 
constitution. 
 
FBI Director Visit, Suharto 
--------------------------- 
 
¶8. Jiang referred a reporter to other relevant authorities when 
asked about the schedule and agenda of FBI Director Robert Mueller's 
January 28-30 visit to Beijing.  China expresses condolences 
regarding Suharto's death, Jiang stated, noting that he worked 
toward the resumption of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
