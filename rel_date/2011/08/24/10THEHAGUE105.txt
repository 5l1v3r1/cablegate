SUBJECT: NETHERLANDS REQUEST FOR TREATMENT OF SERGEANT 
MAJOR K.W. BOON 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY.  The Dutch Ministry of Defense (MOD) has 
requested medical evaluation at Walter Reed Army Medical 
Center for Sergeant-Major K.W. Boon for "Medically 
Unexplained Physical Symptoms (MUPS)" following his 
deployment to Northern Iraq in 1991.  Preliminary 
coordination has been accomplished for evaluation and 
appropriate follow-on outpatient care with MOD funding the 
costs of the programs and all travel expenses.  Ambassador 
Levin strongly concurs with this request.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 ¶2.  Sergeant-Major K.W. Boon, a member of the Royal 
Netherlands Marine Corps, has been evaluated by Dutch medical 
experts with no success.  The MOD Principal Director of 
Personnel, Lieutenant General J.G. A. Leijh has authorized 
further evaluation by an "external institute" and officially 
requested DOD evaluation.  Preliminary coordination has been 
accomplished with Walter Reed Army Medical Center for a 
five-day pre-program evaluation and if needed a three-week 
Track 1 Specialized Care program.  The programs and all 
travel expenses will be funded by the Royal Dutch Navy 
through their Point of Contact in the Dutch Caribbean Naval 
Command, Commander A.J.N. Liefting MD, Chief Medical Officer. 
 
¶3.  The Dutch have been a valued partner in our security 
efforts including both wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Approval of this request is in the best interests of our 
continued relationship and has the full endorsement of 
Ambassador Levin.
