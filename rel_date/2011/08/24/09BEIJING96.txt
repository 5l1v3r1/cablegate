NUCLEAR TERRORISM PLENARY IN THE HAGUE 
 
¶1. On January 13, PolOff accompanied Arjen van den Berg, 
Political Counselor at the Dutch Embassy in Beijing, and 
Andrey Chernyshov, Second Secretary at the Russian Embassy in 
Beijing, in a meeting with MFA Arms Control and Disarmament 
Department Missile Division Deputy Director Wang Daxue.  Van 
den Berg presented a diplomatic note to Wang, inviting China 
to send participants to the Fifth Plenary Meeting of the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) at The 
Hague June 16-17.  Van den Berg emphasized that the meeting 
would be jointly chaired by the United States and Russia and 
that the Dutch delegation would be led jointly by the Dutch 
Foreign and Justice Ministries. 
 
¶2.  Wang Daxue thanked van den Berg for the invitation and 
said he would share it with his superiors.  Unofficially, 
Wang noted that China was a member of the GICNT, had attended 
each previous plenary meeting and would, in all likelihood, 
attend the June meeting in The Hague.  Wang assured van den 
Berg that China supports non-proliferation goals and has 
worked closely multilaterally and bilaterally to meet common 
objectives.  He made special mention of successful 
non-proliferation workshops China conducted with the United 
States in 2007.  Wang promised to relay a formal response to 
the invitation to the Dutch Embassy at an appropriate time.
