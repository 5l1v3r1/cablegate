SUBJECT: INDIA WILL LIKELY SUPPORT MANDATE EXTENSION, BUT 
NOT A RESOLUTION CRITICAL OF BURMA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 28922 
 
Poloff delivered reftel demarche to MEA Director (United 
Nations Economic and Social) Dinesh Patnaik on March 20, 
seeking India's support both for a resolution criticizing 
the failings of the Burmese regime and for an extension of 
the mandate for the UN's Special Rapporteur for the human 
rights situation in Burma.  Patnaik noted that the GOI can 
be counted on to support the mandate, but will retain its 
consistent policy to refrain from supporting any 
country-specific criticisms.  He added that India will not 
oppose such a resolution.
