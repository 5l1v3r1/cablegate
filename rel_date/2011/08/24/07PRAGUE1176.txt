SUBJECT: CZECHS APPRECIATE DETAILS ON DESIGNATION OF 
IRANIAN ENTITIES 
 
REF: STATE 148605 
 
(SBU) Ambassador Josef Koutsky, who serves in the Czech MFA 
Middle East and Africa Department, and Hana Jelinkova, MFA 
Iran desk officer welcomed our non-paper and fact sheet on 
the designation of Iranian entities and individuals and noted 
that these designations are "generally not a problem" for the 
GOCR since they do not have commercial ties with Iran. (Note: 
As discussed in Reftel B, Iran imposed trade sanctions 
against the Czech Republic after relations became strained in 
Â¶1998.  End Note.)  The Ambassador had several questions 
related to the differences between the executive orders and 
why the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - Qods Force was 
designated under E.O. 13224, and the entire IRGC was covered 
under E.O 13382, which we addressed.  Koutsky indicated that 
he would share these details with the other relevant offices 
within the MFA, as well as the Ministry of Finance.  They 
will be back in touch if they have additional questions.
