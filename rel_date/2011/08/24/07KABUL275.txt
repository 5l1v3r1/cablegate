¶1. On January 25, ANDS Executive Director Adib Farhadi passed to 
Deputy ECON Counselor the GOA's consolidated priority project list, 
which emerged from the recent round of JCMB Consultative Group 
meetings in which GOA officials and donor representatives 
participate.  Post successfully negotiated into this final list 
suggestions from Washington (Refs A and C) and ideas from within the 
U.S. Mission.  GOA development of the list was closely coordinated 
with UNAMA.  The GOA intends to circulate the list to JCMB Member 
Missions on January 26.  Senior Afghan officials engaged with the 
JCMB have indicated plans to highlight the priority project list in 
their Berlin presentations and bilaterals with donors.  We may wish 
to look for ways to reinforce the GOA's initiative in our 
interventions and meetings. 
 
¶2.  While an output of the JCMB, the Afghans developed the actual 
list on their own and have closely held their plans to produce and 
issue such a document for Berlin.  The Secretary's visit to NATO 
presents an opportunity to highlight this successful JCMB output - 
the Afghans working through the JCMB donor coordination mechanism to 
produce a coherent priority list of projects.  This list represents 
the priority gaps that the GOA and donors on the ground have 
identified collectively as needing resources immediately.  We should 
urge NATO donors to step to the plate and contribute.  The Afghans 
are aware that the U.S. may highlight the existence and potential 
value of this list in Brussels. 
 
¶3.  Using Ref A, Post will work with ANDS staff to identify target 
donors for each project and to revise the list accordingly for use 
in bilateral presentations.  We will send that list to Washington as 
soon as it is complete. 
 
¶4. Begin Text of List Document:
