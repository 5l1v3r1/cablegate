REF: STATE 125943 
 
¶1.  On July 07, 2005, as directed in REFTEL, the Emergency 
Action Committee (EAC) at Embassy Madrid met to discuss the 
bombing incidents that occurred in London. 
 
¶2.  The EAC discussed current conditions and indicators 
within Spain relating to any recent reporting and law 
enforcement and intelligence information.  Physical and 
technical security of the Embassy and Consulate General was 
also discussed.  All Section and Agency Heads were advised by 
the DCM to make sure that all staff and family are kept fully 
informed and integrated into the Embassy operations and 
viewpoints to ease their concerns.  The EAC concurred that 
security appears to be at least in-line with current threats 
and no augmentation or alternatives were suggested. 
Conditions in Spain currently do not necessitate additional 
security measures.  Local police have temporarily increased 
attention to the Diplomatic Missions.  Nonetheless, evolving 
conditions will be watched closely.
