¶1.  (SBU)  Emboff met with UN Operations in Cote d'Ivoire 
(ONUCI) Human Rights Affairs and Code of Conduct Affairs 
Offices to discuss implementation of policies to combat 
sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and trafficking in 
persons (TIP).  ONUCI officers indicated that ONUCI has a 
rigorous, written policy in place that explicitly bans 
engagement with prostitutes, engagement in any type of 
coercive sexual experience involving any sort of power 
imbalance, and all forms of human trafficking. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  ONUCI officers said that UN policy in this area is 
rigorously enforced, and there is a specialized, two-person 
unit charged with investigating cases of alleged infractions 
of the SEA/TIP code.  When concluded, cases are referred to 
the UN's office of SEA in NY for further review.  While cases 
themselves remain confidential, officers revealed that 
several investigations have concluded with ONUCI personnel 
being stripped of their immunity in Cote d'Ivoire, sent home 
and subject to prosecution according to the contributing 
state's applicable legal provisions.  Few such cases have 
occurred, though ONUCI personnel from Morocco and Pakistan 
were mentioned.
