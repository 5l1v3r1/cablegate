On the Political/Social Front 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  MDC Wins House Speakership...  The MDC (MDC-T) Tsvangirai 
formation shocked ZANU-PF and President Robert Mugabe by winning the 
House of Assembly speaker's position on Monday.  MDC-T's Lovemore 
Moyo defeated Paul Themba Nyathi, nominated by the MDC Mutambara 
faction (MDC-M) by a vote of 110-98.  In a secret ballot, apparently 
4 ZANU-PF MPs and 8 MDC-M MPs defied their parties and voted for 
Moyo.  The following day, Mugabe convened Parliament.  In a blatant 
demonstration of disrespect for Mugabe and his position as 
president, the MPs jeered and heckled him throughout his speech. 
Moyo's election confounded SADC, which had called for the convening 
of Parliament after Tsvangirai failed to sign a power-sharing deal, 
and put to bed an alliance between ZANU-PF and MDC-M designed to 
undermine MDC-T.  Tsvangirai and his party are emboldened and will 
undoubtedly continue to take a strong stand in negotiations with 
ZANU-PF.  See Harare 747, 741, 730. 
 
¶4.  Police Forcefully Disrupt NGO Meeting...  The anti-riot squad 
illegally disrupted the annual meeting of Crisis in Zimbabwe 
Coalition (CZC) at a local hotel on August 28, claiming that under 
the dreaded Public Order and Security Act (POSA), CZC should have 
given them four days' notice for convening a public meeting. 
However, the High Court previously determined that under POSA 
internal meetings do not require police permission. 
 
¶5.  Looming Food Crisis...  The Mugabe government continues to deny 
NGOs and Private Voluntary Organizations access to over 1.3 million 
at-risk Zimbabweans to provide food, water, seed, fertilizer, and 
hygienic support.  Currently, less than 300,000 people are receiving 
assistance, and record-low harvests may expose up to 5 million 
 
HARARE 00000758  002 OF 003 
 
 
Zimbabweans to a severe food crisis.  While there are large 
stockpiles of supplies in South Africa and Zimbabwe, the supply 
backlog is forcing donors to reconsider the utility of sending 
additional aid to Zimbabwe.  Some NGOs have been able to conduct 
discrete workaround operations with the consent of local officials, 
though these groups still routinely face the threat of violence from 
war veterans and youth brigade members. See Harare 754. 
 
¶6.  MDC Secretary General Tendai Biti is seeking to have the 
humanitarian access issue raised in Parliament.  The UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization is preparing a presentation for 
parliamentarians on the impact of the suspension on food aid. The 
MDC is also planning a media blitz on the effects of the NGO ban. 
In addition, local and international NGOs are increasing their 
advocacy by issuing a common statement on behalf of 100+ agencies. 
They are also finalizing a presentation to convey the impact of the 
ban on food security, agricultural recovery, nutrition/child 
protection, and water/sanitation, and they also plan to step up 
advocacy in the region. 
 
¶7.  Death Toll at 171...  The death toll from post-March 27 election 
violence now stands at 171.  However, the actual number is likely 
higher, due to the unknown number of unconfirmable deaths.  See 
Harare 751. 
 
¶8.  Infrastructure Bombing...  On the evening of August 21, two 
bombs were detonated on the Hunyani bridge 25 kilometers from Harare 
on the Bulawayo-Harare road.  The bombs caused minor damage to the 
road and rail line.  Police have no leads or suspects in their 
investigation.  This is the second bombing to take place this month. 
 At this point we don't know if this was malicious mischief, efforts 
by an anti-Mugabe group to harm infrastructure, or intentional 
ZANU-PF action to later blame on the MDC. 
 
¶9.  Abuses of Students Come to Light...  "Inside Pandora's Box" 
details the strong-arm tactics used against Zimbabwean student 
protesters in 2006.  Produced by Students Solidarity Trust-a local 
Zimbabwean student activist group-the 42-page report delves into the 
detentions and beatings of students, as well as the legislative 
measures taken by the Mugabe regime to suppress student protests. 
The report is on the Embassy intranet site. 
 
¶10.  Olympic Swimmer Returns Triumphant...  Olympic gold and silver 
medalist Kirsty Coventry returned to a hero's welcome at Harare 
International Airport this week.  The Herald awarded her a front 
page picture and banner headline, "Royal welcome for Kirsty." 
Mugabe mentioned her triumph in his speech at the opening of 
Parliament; the MDC responded by shouting, "she's white, she's 
white," in mockery of Mugabe's customary racist attitude toward 
Zimbabwe's white population. 
 
---------------------------------- 
On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶11.  Payment Delays/Power Cuts Strain RioZim...  Nonpayment for gold 
deliveries to the Reserve Bank continues to constrain cash flow at 
RioZim.  In its half-year results, RioZim reported that gold 
production at Renco Mine declined 31% compared to the same period 
last year, affected by load shedding and plant breakdowns.  Nickel 
and copper production fell 39%, primarily due to power cuts. 
Analysts see the company's best prospects in coal and diamonds. 
Coal production at Sengwa Colliery increased just over 10% before 
RioZim recently terminated mining there in May to focus on seeking a 
partner for a 2000 MW power station envisioned for the site.  Murowa 
Diamonds, 22% owned by RioZim, nearly tripled its diamond output to 
135,000 carats.

¶12.  Delta Corporation in "Survival Mode"...   Delta executives said 
the economy had entered the "melt down zone" and Delta was in 
"survival mode," streamlining operations and refocusing on exports. 
Capacity utilization at the beverage giant is 25-35%.  Illustrative 
of the export strategy, local sales of malt-based lager declined 46% 
in the last 6-month reporting period as Delta sidetracked its barley 
malt for the export market.  Elsewhere in the business tea 
production fell 62% over the previous reporting period, along with 
declines in poultry, beef, fruits and vegetables. Analysts 
nevertheless recommend Delta for its strong balance sheet, cash flow 
and brands. 
 
¶13.  Dismal Turnout at Harare Ag Show...  At mid-week, attendance at 
the once-renowned Harare Agricultural Show was less than a quarter 
of last year's already poor showing, matched only by the low turnout 
of exhibitors. 
 
¶14.  Inflation Factoid...  The highest-denomination note (Z$500) 
fell in value on the street from US$33 to US$2.50 in the month of 
August.

Quote of the Week

¶15.  Mugabe at a lunch marking the opening of Parliament, reported 
in The Herald of August 27:  Cde Mugabe said judging by the number 
of new cars on the roads, some of which included the latest models, 
it was surprising to note that Zimbabwe was regarded as poor.
