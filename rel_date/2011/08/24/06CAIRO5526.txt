¶1.  During a September 4 meeting with MFA Office Director for 
Candidacy Issues, Counselor Hatem Tag-Eldin, poloffs reviewed 
pending USG requests for Egyptian support for elections to 
the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), the International Law 
Commission (ILC), and the International Mobile Satellite 
Organization (IMSO).  Tag-Eldin had no definitive response on 
any of the three reftel demarches (also formally delivered to 
the MFA via diplomatic notes), but committed to sharing the 
U.S. requests with appropriate offices within the GOE. 
Tag-Eldin, in only his second week on the job, offered to 
follow up and to contact emboffs with any definitive response. 
 
¶2.  During the conversation, Tag El-Din noted that Egypt 
would greatly appreciate U.S. support for its own candidates 
to the UNHCR and the ILC, respectively.  He noted his 
understanding that official GOE requests for support in these 
elections had been conveyed to U.S. missions in Geneva and 
New York.  Poloffs stressed the U.S. policy of not trading 
votes during elections to multilateral fora.  Regarding ref C 
demarche on our candidate to IMSO (Steven Lett), post will 
seek additional information on Egypt's views on this election 
and will report separately.
