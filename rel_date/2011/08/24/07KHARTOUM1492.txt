SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) While obstacles to the deployment of the UN-African Union 
Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) exist--primarily at the local 
level--deployment of the force has been steady, and there are no 
indications that Sudan is blocking UNAMID as a matter of official 
policy.  However, as CDA Fernandez explained recently to Foreign 
Minister Lam Akol (reftel), the logistical demands on the 
peace-keeping mission (including visa, land, water and customs 
requirements) will increase exponentially as the force deploys. 
These complexities, in addition to bureaucratic inertia at the local 
level, could jeopardize the deployment timelines set by the UN. 
¶2. (SBU) A recent report from the UK Embassy in Khartoum, based on a 
briefing with UNAMID Director of Administration Mohamed Yunnus, 
provides a reasonable snapshot of the current conditions: 
-- Land: There are no problems in El Fasher.  Some detailed 
arrangements remain to be made in Zalingei, but no obstacle is 
expected.  In Nyala, intensive negotiations that have included UN/AU 
Joint Special Representative Rudolphe Adada and Akol have resolved 
some administrative challenges caused by friction within the 
Sudanese Government, between Khartoum and South Darfur State, and 
between the Wali of South Darfur and local farmers.  The final 
agreement for Nyala is expected to be delivered to UNAMID on 
September 21.  (Note: Sudan's interagency technical committee, 
chaired by MFA Undersecretary Mutriff Siddiq and charged with 
supporting UNAMID deployment, met on September 12 and resolved the 
outstanding land issue in Zalingei, Akol told CDA Fernandez on 
September 18. End note.) 
-- Night Flying and Airports: UNAMID has no intention of conducting 
routine night flights in or out of Darfur at present.  Arrangements 
for casualty evacuation are in place, however.  There will need to 
be an arrangement for night flying when UNAMID gets night-capable 
tactical aircraft.  Reports of Sudan blocking the use of large AN 
124 transport aircraft are false.  None of the runways in Darfur are 
capable of supporting this aircraft.  (Note: Khartoum is the only 
airport in Sudan that routinely operates after dark and the only 
airport suitable for an AN124.  Safety arrangements and lighting are 
rarely reliable elsewhere.  End note.) 
-- Customs: The customs issues are resolved, with UN materiel 
transiting the port at an acceptable rate.  (Note: Three weeks ago, 
senior UN officials reported that fifty percent of the backlog had 
been cleared, and the rest was proceeding.  End note.)

Comment 
------- 
¶3. (SBU) These are very early days, and whether Sudan permits the 
delivery of material and resources in support of non-African parts 
of UNAMID will present more objective tests of its commitment to UN 
Security Council Resolution 1769.  Sudan's previous track record on 
following through on its promises is weak, but this time, the 
Sudanese, will be different.  Bureaucracy at all levels is 
obstructionist by instinct, and there will be local difficulties and 
normal logistical bottlenecks, at least, throughout UNAMID's 
deployment.  That said, PAE has reported that it has received some 
necessary, and expedited, flight clearances from the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs for later this week.  This pace of expedited 
clearances will need to continue--and not relapse into the seven to 
eight-day "normal" clearance period--in order for all sides to 
facilitate the arrival of UNAMID. CDA will continue to engage the 
Sudanese government on these issues at all levels. End comment.
