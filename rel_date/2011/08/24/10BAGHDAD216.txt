SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AMPLIFIES VP'S MESSAGES IN IRAQI MEDIA 
INTERVIEWS 
 
¶1. Summary: Reinforcing the messages delivered by Vice President 
Biden during his recent visit to Iraq, Ambassador Hill hosted a 
January 24 round table discussion with eight local Arabic media 
outlets, followed by interviews with two major Iraqi TV channels. 
The back-to-back media engagements at the Embassy helped quash 
negative local speculation about the reasons and timing of the VP's 
visit, and amplified our message that Iraq remains a top priority 
for the United States. End Summary. 
 
¶2. The Ambassador's 90-minute round table with local Arabic print, 
radio and newswire journalists was arranged by the Public Affairs 
section and resulted in saturation coverage in the next day's news 
cycle.  Headlines and articles on January 25 focused on the 
Ambassador's rejection of earlier media speculation that VP Biden 
had come to Iraq solely to propose a solution to the controversy 
surrounding the disqualification of more than 500 electoral 
candidates. Resulting headlines in national papers featured 
Ambassador Hill's explanation that Washington had not interfered in 
the issue, and that VP Biden had already planned to come to Iraq 
long before the disqualification imbroglio erupted. The popular 
independent daily Azzaman ran a front-page story with a photo, 
quoting the Ambassador that the VP had come "to listen to Iraqi 
leaders in a supporting role." 
 
¶3. The roundtable discussion and TV interviews with Al Hurra and Al 
Sumariya served to drive home the message that while the U.S. did 
not object to applying a constitutional ban on Baathist candidates, 
the process by which they are excluded had to be transparent, fair 
and credible in order for the elections themselves to appear 
likewise.  The Ambassador echoed the Vice President's theme that we 
are confident Iraqi leaders understand the problem and are working 
hard to resolve it. 
 
¶4.  The question of whether or not the U.S. agreed with the 
reinstatement of alleged Baathist candidates dominated the 
discussions with the media. The Ambassador reiterated the point that 
the United States condemns the crimes of the previous regime and 
would never support a return to power of the Baathists.  This firm 
statement was widely re-played in the media. 
 
¶5. All major outlets also reported on the Ambassador's response to 
tough questions on the delay in removing Iraq from Chapter VII 
sanctions.  The media afforded favorable coverage to the 
Ambassador's replies that we needed to speed up the process and that 
A/S Feltman was remaining in Iraq specifically to discuss this issue 
with the GOI.  Finally, the Ambassador's iteration of the VP's 
announcement regarding the Blackwater appeal was carried in several 
print outlets. 
 
 
¶6. We will continue to monitor coverage of the Ambassador's public 
messaging and report back as warranted.
