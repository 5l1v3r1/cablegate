¶1. The Ukrainian MFA responded to the delivery of the proposed 
outline for a global nuclear detection architecture model guidelines 
in diplomatic note 411/20-011-2060 dated December 14, 2007.  The 
diplomatic note observed that the Ukrainian side supported the draft 
guidelines.  The diplomatic note also commented that further work on 
the draft should facilitate the creation of a reference model and 
operational requirements to develop national, regional and global 
systems to detect and increase the efficiency of combating the 
nuclear terrorism threat.  At the same time, mechanisms of 
collaboration to implement this initiative should be further 
revised.  It would be appropriate to take into account the 
activities of the Proliferation Security Initiative, the Global 
Threat Reduction Initiative and the Global Partnership. 
 
¶2. Finally, the diplomatic note said the Ukrainian side could 
present a number of structural and editing suggestions during the 
Global Initiative expert meeting on January 22, 2008, in Washington, 
D.C.  Currently, the Ukrainian side was identifying the composition 
of the Ukrainian delegation.  A Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) 
Anti-Terrorism Center representative would be appointed the contact 
person to further revise the guidelines.
