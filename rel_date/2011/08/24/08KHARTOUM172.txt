¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  Under the authority of new Director Yassin El-Hag 
Abdeen, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) claims that the North 
is completely prepared for the April census. The director, an NCP 
member with no professional background in the field, rejects any 
suggestion that there are census mapping gaps in Darfur.  He claims 
that Dafurians, even IDPs, will participate in census enumeration 
without skepticism or fear. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On 31 January, poloff met with newly-appointed CBS Director 
Dr. Yassin El-Hag Abdeen.  Abdeen was formerly the Director of 
Faisal Islamic Bank, Sudan Airways, and the National Electricity 
Corporation of Sudan and worked at the Center for Future Studies, a 
Sudanese government-supported think tank in Khartoum.  He was chosen 
by the Presidency just two weeks ago to replace former CBS Director 
Dr. Awad Hag-Ali.  This shift in general leadership in the North 
comes just three and a half months before the national census is to 
occur. 
 
¶3. (U) Early in the meeting, former Director Awad walked in, greeted 
poloff, and joined in the discussions.  Poloff questioned Awad and 
Abdeen as to why the switch in leadership was made and both claimed 
not to know.  Abdeen confessed that he was happy working at the 
Center for Future Studies and seemed confused by his appointment to 
the CBS.  He theorized that the Presidency wanted him to "transform 
the CBS" into a policy planning institution.  He said his 
appointment was not only about getting the census done right, but 
about making sure the CBS performs on the whole for years to come. 
He expressed his frustration of working with civil servants, 
something he has not had to do in the past.  Former Director Awad, 
who was in a rather jovial mood, explained that he has returned to 
El-Nilein University full-time as Vice Chancellor.  He has made 
himself available to CBS Director Abdeen for several weeks in order 
to bring him up-to-speed. 
 
---------------------------- 
UNCONVINCING DECLARATIONS 
---------------------------- 
¶4. (U) Dr. Abdeen assured poloff that by mid-February, all technical 
preparations for the census in the North will be in place.  When 
poloff asked about the worrisome issue of the lack of a presidential 
decree to declare the April census date official, Abdeen claimed 
"this will be done in one or two days." He added, "The decree is 
ready; it can be issued by the Presidency over the phone."  He 
assured that "everything is in place" and that the CBS is awaiting 
the official date in order to begin census advocacy campaigns over 
the radio and the TV.  Abdeen said that the advocacy campaigns will 
be heavily targeted to rural communities. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Poloff asked Abdeen what the North is going to do about the 
20 percent of Darfur (corresponding to over 2 million people in IDP 
camps and rebel-controlled areas) that per UNFPA cannot be mapped 
due to security concerns and lack of access by government 
enumerators (ref A).  Abdeen strongly denied that the unmapped areas 
are equal to 20 percent or over 2 million people.  He said that 
there are only "a few pockets" of Darfur that are unmapped and that 
only the rebels live in these areas.  All IDP camps, he claimed, had 
been successfully mapped (although he could not explain how this was 
accomplished).  Rather unconvincingly, Abdeen predicted that there 
will not be any problems with the census in Darfur and that 
Darfurians (even IDPs) will participate.  "This is the fifth census 
in Sudan and the culture is not skeptical of such things."  He 
continued, "It is not the case that people will be unwilling to 
participate." 
 
------------------------------------- 
LACK OF CONFIDENCE AMONG CENSUS STAFF 
------------------------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) Abdeen called in one of his staff to provide poloff with 
the exact numbers on Darfur mapping.  According to the CBS 
statistician, two out of 14 localities in North Darfur are not 
mapped; however, he claimed that these two localities have no 
residents.  In West Darfur, two of eleven localities are unmapped 
because they are inaccessible (rebel-controlled areas).  The staffer 
had no information on the mapping status of South Darfur State. The 
meeting took an interesting turn when the staffer made a personal 
plea to Director Abdeen to hire more CBS staff and increase working 
hours so that the digital enumeration area (EA) maps can be 
completed by 1 March.  The statistician explained that two of the 
CBS staff responsible for map printing had recently resigned and 
that the current staffing is inadequate.  Abdeen, clearly annoyed by 
his subordinate's complaints in front of poloff, told his staffer to 
hire as many people as is necessary to get the job done and quickly

shooed the staffer away.

REMAINING CONCERNS 
--------------------- 
¶7. (U) Abdeen confirmed rumors that the CBS is still advocating for 
five data processing centers in the North.  The South has agreed to 
have only one, located in Rumbek (ref B).  When asked by poloff 
about the status of census preparation in the South, Abdeen said 
that he thought the South would be ready and that the Southern Sudan 
Commission for Census, Statistics, and Evaluation (SSCCSE) had made 
good progress over the last two weeks (refs B and C). 
 
¶8. (SBU)  COMMENT:  This meeting seems to confirm three of our 
suspicions: (a) the North is not as on track as it claims to be in 
terms of census preparation, (b) the North denies there will be any 
problem with holding a census in Darfur, and (c) the new CBS 
director is totally unprepared for his new role.  Throughout the 
meeting, Director Abdeen pulled back the Wizard of Oz-like curtain 
behind him to call in staff to answer critical questions about 
census preparation that he did not have the answers to.  His 
strategy backfired when one of his staffers used the opportunity as 
a platform to convey his lack of confidence in the CBS's preparation 
and inability to meet critical deadlines.  It is apparent that the 
CBS is having internal staffing problems and that new Director 
Abdeen is not yet aware of what is going on is his own organization, 
much less with census preparation in the North. The latest roadblock 
is the lack of a presidential decree making official the April 
census date.  We hope that Abdeen's prediction that the decree will 
be promulgated in one or two days is true, but Abdeen's overtly 
optimistic prediction that it would be issued within days did not 
fill us with confidence.
