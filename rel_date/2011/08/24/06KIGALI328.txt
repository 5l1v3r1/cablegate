SUBJECT: THE PRESIDENT'S MALARIA INITIATIVE IN RWANDA 
 
REF: STATE 51160 
 
¶1. Ambassador Michael Arietti and USAID Mission Director 
Kevin Mullally met on April 4 with Government of Rwanda 
Health Minister Dr. Jean Damascene Ntawukuliryayo to inquire 
as to the government's interest in taking part in the 
President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and Rwanda's 
governmental and non-governmental capacity to implement the 
initiative. 
 
¶2. Amb. Arietti and Mullally informed Minister 
Ntawukuliryayo that Rwanda has been nominated as one of four 
possible new countries for the PMI program in FY 2007.  The 
Minister enthusiastically accepted the proposal for Rwanda 
to participate in the initiative and noted that malaria is 
the number one killer of children in the country.  Malaria 
is the primary cause of mortality in the country, and 
responsible for over 40 percent of all deaths in health 
facilities.  Malaria-related mortality has increased 
dramatically over the last ten years for a number of 
reasons, most notably the advent of drug resistance. 
 
¶3. The Minister was extremely pleased by the prospect of 
malaria prevention and treatment intervention, noting that 
crucial elements will include eliminating the vector, 
increasing public awareness of the disease, and improving 
preventive behavior, including increased use of insecticide- 
treated bed nets.  The significant anticipated resources 
from the President's Malaria Initiative, an estimated USD 17- 
23 million for Rwanda, will have great potential to 
radically reduce malaria's impact on the Rwandan population. 
Minister Ntawukuliryayo indicated that his ministry will 
work closely with the USG in coordinating this effort with 
other ongoing health programs.  Ministry of Health policy 
strives for a cohesive, fully integrated and strong health 
system. 
 
¶4. Ambassador Arietti presented the Minister with a one-page 
non-paper on the PMI (reftel), with a caution to keep the 
information "close hold" until we receive confirmation of 
acceptance and the announcement of Rwanda as a new recipient 
of the PMI.  The Minister agreed to coordinate any 
announcement with the Embassy.  Post notes the coming visit 
of Rwandan President Paul Kagame to the White House in late 
April as an opportunity for further exchange on this 
important initiative. 
 
¶5. Mission looks forward to the announcement as well, and to 
coordinating next steps with Washington.  Telcon with 
Richard Greene, USAID Health Development Officer, on April 3 
to discuss initial planning for Rwanda's participation in 
the PMI program was extremely useful, and we anticipate 
further discussions as we plan for the rapid assessment team 
in mid-May.
