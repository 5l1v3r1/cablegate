SUBJECT: CATHOLIC-MUSLIM FORUM -- KEY INDONESIAN MUSLIM 
LEADER LAUDS EVENT 
 
REF: A. VATICAN 087 
     ¶B. JAKARTA 1792 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  The Catholic-Muslim Forum held in Rome 
November 2-4 promoted strong inter-religious relations, the 
leader of a mass Muslim organization--with over 30 million 
members--told an audience of religious and civic leaders on 
November 11.  Din Syamsuddin, chair of Muhammadiyah, also 
spoke about initiatives he is planning to help facilitate 
peace in the southern Philippines and southern Thailand.  The 
Forum also featured a Jewish leader from Australia who 
delivered greetings in Hebrew, a positive--if rare--event in 
Muslim majority Indonesia.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) Muhammadiyah Chair Syamsuddin was recently selected 
to be president and moderator of the Asian Conference of 
Religions for Peace (ACRP).  (Note:  Along with Nadhlatul 
Ulama, Muhammadiyah is one of Indonesia's two mass Muslim 
organizations.  By most estimates, they are among the largest 
Muslim organizations in the world.)  DepPol/C attended a 
dinner held in Jakarta on November 11 to celebrate 
Syamsuddin's selection to these positions.  Leaders of all 
six major faiths in Indonesia--Islam, Catholicism and 
Protestantism, Buddhism, Confucianism and Hinduism--addressed 
the dinner, plus a Jewish scholar visiting from Australia who 
delivered greetings in Hebrew.  Judaism is not one of the 
officially recognized religions in Muslim-dominated 
Indonesia, so asking a representative of that faith to 
address an important inter-religious event was a significant 
goodwill gesture. 
 
¶3.  (U) In his remarks, Syamsuddin praised the recent 
Catholic-Muslim Forum hosted by the Vatican, commenting on 
its good effect in building better understanding between the 
two religions.  He was one of three Southeast Asian Muslim 
leaders who attended the Forum.  Several prominent Indonesian 
Catholics also traveled with Syamsuddin, including Benny 
Susetyo, Executive Secretary for the Interfaith Commission of 
the Indonesian Catholic Bishops Conference.  Syamsuddin's 
upbeat assessment was particularly noteworthy given that in 
September 2006 he had harsh remarks concerning Pope Benedict 
XVI's Regensburg University statement about the Prophet 
Muhammad.  "Whether the Pope apologizes or not, the Islamic 
community should show that Islam is a religion of 
compassion," Syamsuddin said at the time. 
 
¶4.  (U) Syamsuddin also talked about upcoming initiatives at 
interfaith peace mediation.  A delegation of 15 Buddhists and 
15 Muslims from southern Thailand might visit Indonesia early 
next year under his good offices. Indonesian Vice President 
Yusuf Kalla had hosted talks in Indonesia in September aimed 
at reaching a settlement to the conflict in southern Thailand 
(see Ref A). 
 
¶5. (U) Secondly, Syamsuddin said five members each from the 
Moro National Liberation Front (MILF) and the Moro Islamic 
Liberation Front (MNLF) in the southern Philippines have been 
invited for a dialogue to take place in Indonesia early next 
year.
