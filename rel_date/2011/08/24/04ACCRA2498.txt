Per reftels, Charge d'Affaires met with MFA Supervising 
Director for Legal and Multilateral Affairs, Mrs. Nana Bema 
Kumi, on December 17 to discuss the U.N. human rights 
resolutions on Iran and Turkmenistan. Charge said that 
although the resolutions had passed in the U.N. Third 
Committee in November, the USG is concerned about possible 
no-action motions from Iran and Turkmenistan. He urged the 
GoG to vote against any no-action motions. Although Mrs. Kumi 
expressed concern over the late notice in communicating this 
to her colleagues, she assured the Charge that she would 
share this message immediately with the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and others who work on these matters. She said that 
it could also be useful to communicate this message with 
Ambassador Poku in Washington.
