EDITORIAL OPINION 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
European Union 
Moscow's initial reaction to Turkey drawing closer to the EU 
was lukewarm. "If you enter the EU we cannot meet 
frequently," Putin was reported as telling his host, Prime 
Minister Erdogan, during the former's visit to Ankara in 
late 2004. However, at the two leaders' next meeting in 
Moscow in January 2005, Putin already said that Russia was 
in favour of Turkey's EU membership, primarily since it 
promised to open up new trading channels for Russia. ''We 
welcome Turkey's success at the EU Brussels summit,'' Putin 
said in Moscow. ''I hope that Turkey's integration in the 
European Union will open up a new horizon for Russian- 
Turkish business cooperation.''
