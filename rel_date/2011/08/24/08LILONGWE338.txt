According to Paul Chiunguzeni, Director of Political Affairs 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Undule Mwakasungula, 
Chairperson of the Human Rights Consultative Committee, 
Malawi will send a team of up to 18 people to participate in 
SADC observations of the Zimbabwe run-off elections. 
Chiunguzeni said the leader of Malawi's participants will be 
Dr. Benson Tembo, current Malawi High Commissioner to 
Zimbabwe.  The breakdown by organization will be: 
 
Malawian High Commission to Zimbabwe - 2 (including Dr. Tembo) 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs - 1 
Malawi Law Commission - 2 
Malawi Electoral Commission - 3 (including one election 
commissioner) 
Civil Society and Non-governmental Organizations - 10 
 
Mwakasungula, who is organizing civil society participants, 
commented that the number of non-government participants was 
still dependent upon organizations finding funding sources to 
pay for travel expenses and that the actual number who travel 
could be less than the proposed 10.
