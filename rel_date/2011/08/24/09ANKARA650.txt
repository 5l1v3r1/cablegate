Comments on the New Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu 
 
Sahin Alpay wrote in Islamist oriented Zaman: "Davutoglu has been a 
significant figure in shaping the mostly successful foreign policy 
of the ruling AKP.  Thus, Davutoglu is the perfect choice for this 
post." 
 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "It was a noteworthy 
comment when the new foreign minister described relations with the 
West as 'one of the fundamental legs of Turkey's foreign policy 
vision.'  This comment, in a way, addresses concerns that 
Davutoglu's main focus will be the Middle East and the Arab world." 
 
Cuneyt Ulsever wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "Davutoglu's 
multi-faceted foreign policy approach generally receives 
appreciation, however given the current situation his approach may 
be spiraling out of control.  So far, Turkey's focus on Hizbullah 
and Hamas has not produced anything positive at all.  Mediation 
efforts regarding Iran and Syria have not been successful either. 
It is good for foreign policy to have many facets, but there should 
be an overall focused goal as well.  In Turkey's case, this must be 
EU accession." 
 
Bloody Attack on Village Wedding in Mardin 
All papers and TV channels report that the wedding reception of the 
daughter of Bilge village's former head turned into a battle ground 
due to a feud between two families.  Four masked gunmen waged an 
attack with grenades and automatic weapons on the wedding party,

killing 44 people and injuring 17 others. 
 
Prime Minister Erdogan to Visit Baku and Sochi 
Mainstream Sabah and Islamist-oriented Zaman report that Prime 
Minister Erdogan is going to Baku on May 13 to hold meetings with 
Azerbaijani President Aliyev and to Sochi on May 16 to meet with 
Russian President Putin. 
 
In a related story, mainstream Hurriyet reports that President Gul 
will go to Prague May 7-8 for a trilateral summit with Azerbaijani 
President Aliyev and Armenian President Sargsian. 
 
Talabani: "No Bargaining over Kirkuk" 
Mainstream Sabah reports that Iraqi President Jalal Talabani talked 
to press in Suleymaniye following his meeting with Iraqi KRG 
President Massoud Barzani.  Talabani stressed his objection to the 
UN proposal to postpone the referendum in Kirkuk for five years and 
said "Article 140 regarding the referendum in Kirkuk is a legal and 
constitutional article.  I will never agree to give up Kirkuk in 
return for something else.  There will be no bargaining over 
Kirkuk." 
 
PKK's Karayilan Talks to Milliyet 
Mainstream Milliyet features a front page interview with PKK leader 
Murat Karayilan.  Columnist Hasan Cemal conducted the interview in 
"one of the villages near the Qandil mountains in northern Iraq." 
Karayilan made encouraging comments about peace by saying "We have 
strong hopes for peace.  The 1993 ceasefire was a good chance but 
did not go further due to lack of political will.  This time we have 
another important chance and this chance has to be used.  We want to 
see an end to bloodshed.  If we can start a dialogue, we can then 
talk about disarmament.  (Abdullah) Ocalan is the address for 
dialogue.  If that is not acceptable then we should be the ones 
consulted.  And even if that is also unacceptable, those chosen by 
the political will of the people [i.e. the largely pro-Kurdish 
opposition party DTP] should be the venue for dialogue." 
 
Could the Taliban Get Their Hands On Pakistan's Nuclear Weapons? 
(CNN Turk) 
Media note Washington is increasingly concerned about the security 
of Pakistan's nuclear weapons as the Pakistani military engages in 
intense fighting with the Taliban.  Liberal Radikal reports in 
"Pakistan, The U.S.' Nuclear Nightmare," that "The Obama 
Administration's concerns are increasing over whether Pakistan's 
nuclear weapons could fall into the wrong hands," as, "Pakistan was 
pressured by the U.S. to fight the Taliban, and thousands of 
civilians are now fleeing the area."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet 
headlines, "The U.S. Is Worried About Pakistan," as, "The Taliban 
Could Capture (Pakistan's) Nuclear Weapons."  Mainstream Haberturk 
reports in "Where are Pakistan's Nuclear Weapons?" that "The U.S. 
has given Pakistan $100 million in order to secure the weapons," 
but, "Washington is nervous that as the Taliban gains power, the 
weapons could wind up in the wrong hands."  CNN Turk reports "As the 
Taliban spreads its influence, the U.S. becomes more and more 
worried about the safety of Pakistan's nuclear weapons." 
 
In a related story, mainstream Sabah carries the sensational 
headline, "Dogs Are Eating Dead Civilians On the Side of the Road," 
and the paper reports, "With every passing day, violence escalates 
in Pakistan's northwest regions and the threat to civilian life 
continues," as "150,000 civilians, mostly women and children, have 
scattered throughout the country in order to flee the fighting" 
between the Taliban and the Pakistani military. 
 
Gates Embarks on Mid East Tour to Calm Fears Regarding U.S.-Iran 
Dialogue. 
Media note Defense Secretary Robert Gates has embarked on a tour of 
the Middle East in order to assure U.S. allies that talks with Iran 
will not harm the U.S.' relations with its current allies in the Mid 
East.  Leftist Taraf headlines "Iran Is Still Showing Its Fist," and 
 
ANKARA 00000650  003 OF 003 
 
 
notes Secretary Gates "gave a guarantee to U.S. allies that 
U.S.-Iran talks will not damage U.S. relations with other Gulf 
states."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet headlines, "Gates 
Emphasized that Washington's Rapprochement with Iran Will Not Damage 
Relations With Washington's Allies" and "The U.S. Will Not Upset 
Riyadh" or other Gulf states.  In "An Iran Guarantee from Gates," 
mainstream Haberturk reports, "Gates gave a guarantee that the 
improvement in relations between the U.S. and Iran will not do 
damage to U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia."  Islamist-oriented 
Zaman reports, "Gates Will Calm Arab Fears Over The U.S.-Iran 
Dialogue."
