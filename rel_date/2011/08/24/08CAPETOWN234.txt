FACTOR? 
 
¶1.  (U) The South Africa Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) 
organized a voters registration drive during the weekend of November 
8 and 9, 2008, in an effort to energize the younger citizens to 
participate in the 2009 election.  From all accounts the campaign 
was a success. According to the IEC 3.6 millions people visited the 
19,000 stations set up across the country.  Of these 1.6 million 
became newly registered citizens to vote in the 2009 election.  The 
IEC finally announced that 21.6 million voters are now registered to 
vote. 
 
¶2.  (U) In a statement the chairperson of the IEC, Ms Brigalia Bam, 
said "The IEC is delighted to see the success of the drive to 
register voters, especially the youth, who represent a majority of 
the weekend registration activity at 77.9%."  The IEC set up a 
mechanism on their website which allowed citizens to check their 
status as voters.  According to the CEO of the IEC, South Africans 
visited the website in huge numbers.  "The IEC is probably the most 
visited website at the moment," said Ms Pansy Tlakula.  She added 
that they also received thousands of text messages checking the 
registration details. 
 
¶3.  (U) In the weeks preceding November 8-9, a concerted media 
campaign involving print, radio and television drew the attention of 
young South Africans to the results of the U.S. elections with the 
message that "if change can be made in the most powerful nation on 
earth" citizens of this country can also motivate change by 
exercising their right to vote.  Political analysts have suggested 
that the success of the voters' registration campaign could be 
attributed to the youth being inspired by the results of the U.S. 
elections.  For example, the provincial paper, The Witness, said 
"U.S. election inspires young people to register on SA's voters 
roll."  Additionally, the morning tabloid, The Times ran an article 
that said, "scratch beneath the surface of the IEC's numbers and it 
is clear that the young are more fired up than ever before about 
voting.  Far more women than men registered to vote, a statistic 
that goes against the grain of all previous registration drives. 
Election 2009 promises to re-invigorate South African politics just 
as the incredible campaign of Barack Obama brought new life to U.S. 
politics." 
 
¶4. (SBU) On November 19, Cape Town Poloff met with ANC MP Francois 
Beukman who told Poloff that he believes that the recent U.S. 
presidential election has inspired South Africans to register to 
vote in greater numbers than seen in the past, especially among the 
youth.  He also said that the ANC had largely increased its voter 
registration numbers over the past weekend's voter registration 
drive in numbers that exceeded the ANC's expectations.
