TANZANIA & TURKEY WILL CO-HOST SOMALI TALKS 
 
REF: DAR ES SAL 796 
 
¶1. We have received information (reftel) that the Government 
of Tanzania (GOT) has expressed interest in partnering with 
Turkey to bring the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and 
Somali opposition factions together for talks.  In response 
to this idea, we request post draw from the following talking 
points in discussions with the GOT. 
 
¶2. BEGIN POINTS: 
 
--We understand the GOT has expressed interest in partnering 
with Turkey to bring the TFG and Somali opposition factions 
together for talks.  We appreciate the underlying sentiment 
behind this idea to isolate Al-Shabaab by broadening the 
political base of the TFG.  We believe the TFG needs to 
broaden its political base to include other moderates, and we 
are urging the TFG to do so by reaching out to regional 
administrations, clan, traditional, and civil society leaders 
and groups such as Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jamma. 
 
--However, we do not think revisiting the Djibouti Peace 
Process (DPP) would be an effective means of broadening the 
TFG,s political base.  On the contrary, holding a new peace 
conference or round of reconciliation talks outside of the 
established DPP could negatively affect, and possibly derail, 
the progress that has been made to date. 
 
--We are specifically concerned about the suggestion that 
Eritrea would be invited to the table.  There have been 
similar proposals from Qatar and Egypt.  To date, Eritrea has 
played a very unhelpful role in Somalia, providing arms, 
funds, and other support to Al-Shabaab and other violent 
extremists who use the force of arms to oppose the TFG and 
the DPP.  Given this harmful role, we support the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the 
African Union, and the regional states (including Kenya, 
Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Uganda) in their efforts to address 
Eritrea,s public rhetoric and covert behavior, and to align 
Eritrea with the wider international community's support for 
the TFG and DPP. 
 
--We are interested in promoting broad reconciliation, peace, 
and stability in Somalia.  At this time, we believe that 
international efforts should be focused on supporting the DPP 
and the TFG and in encouraging all parties that wish for 
peace to join the peace process.  We welcome constructive 
efforts to achieve that end and would welcome efforts by 
Tanzania to support the frontline states and undercut support 
for violent opponents of the DPP. 
 
--We appreciate Tanzania,s efforts to support the TFG, 
including Tanzania,s earlier offer to train Somali troops as 
part of a regional effort. 
 
--We look forward to continued dialogue with the GOT 
regarding Somalia.  END POINTS.
