In Today's Papers 
 
A Gentlemen's Showdown in Parliament 
Media outlets give prominent and extensive coverage to yesterday's 
live televised debate in parliament between ruling party AKP Deputy 
Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat and main opposition CHP Deputy Kemal 
Kilicdaroglu.  Noted television anchorman Ugur Dundar moderated the 
debate, which was carried live by 20 television stations. The event, 
the first of its kind in parliament's history, commenced after a 
series of public accusations flew between the two MPs for a week. 
During the debate, Kilicdaroglu accused Firat of irregularities 
regarding the MENAS exports company.  Firat has owned up to 30% of 
MENAS and Kilicdaroglu presented documents which he claims implicate 
Firat in various court cases, audits and inspection reports 
regarding irregularities at the company.  The discussion ended with 
no solid conclusion, although Firat demanded Kilicdaroglu's apology 
for repeatedly calling on Firat to resign. 
 
According to Hurriyet's web survey, 58.8 percent thought 
Kilicdaroglu won the debate, while 41.2 percent thought Firat won. 
Vatan's survey indicated 87.3 percent favored Kilicdaroglu, while 
25.3 percent favored Firat. Zaman's survey showed 53.26 percent 
favored Firat and 46.74 percent favored Kilicdaroglu.  Haber7's 
survey indicated 85.2 favored Firat over 14.9 percent for 
Kilicdaroglu. 
 
Editorial Commentary on TV Debate: CHP v AKP 
 
Fikret Bila wrote in mainstream Milliyet:  "Kilicdaroglu was able to 
present concrete evidence that Firat's company MENAS was involved in 
fictitious exports.  However, he was not able to prove Firat was 
involved in drug smuggling.  On the other hand, Firat's denials 
weren't very satisfactory.  In short, yesterday's debate showed us 
businessmen who are elected as deputies should immediately transfer 
their business to a trustee in order to put a concrete distance 
between politics and trade." 
 
Mustafa Mutlu wrote in mainstream Vatan:  "Was Kilicdaroglu able to 
overcome his rival Firat during yesterday's debate?  Kilicdaroglu 
injured Firat, but was not able to take him out altogether.  While 
Kilicdaroglu presented concrete evidence regarding allegations 
against Firat's company MENAS, Firat failed to satisfy Kilicdaroglu 
with his answers on these issues.  I am sure all pro-government 
media will praise Firat's answers.  However, mending the injuries he 
received from yesterday's debate will take time.  As I said, 
yesterday's debate did not destroy Firat, but seriously damaged his 
credibility." 
 
Mustafa Unal in Islamist-oriented Zaman: "Both Firat and 
Kilicdaroglu were careful to refrain from insults during yesterday's 
debate.  We don't have a clear score to show the winner of 
yesterday's showdown between the two politicians.  Neither side 
accepted defeat.  We must thank Firat and Kilicdaroglu for 
maintaining their professional character. This debate sets the 
standard for possible future debates." 
 
Sener, Baykal on Deniz Feneri Fraud Case 
Media outlets report former deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener 
said "Prime Minister Erdogan and other key government officials are 
linked to the Turks responsible for the fraud in the Germany-based 
Islamist-oriented Deniz Feneri charity."  Sener cited German court 
officials' claims that those responsible for the embezzlement of 
money donated to Deniz Feneri were hiding in Turkey.  Sener stressed 
those that were responsible for the fraud were being protected by 
the AKP government.  He accused the PM of blocking investigations 
into the fraud.  Sener, who resigned from the AKP earlier this year, 
was preparing to launch a new political party. 
 
Meanwhile, papers report opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal visited 
Parliamentary Speaker Koksal Toptan on Thursday.  Baykal told Toptan 
 
ANKARA 00001719  002 OF 003 
 
 
that Zahid Akman, the head of Turkey's media watchdog RTUK, should 
step down from his post due to the fraud charges against him. 
Baykal reportedly asked Toptan what would happen if the German court 
asked Interpol to issue an arrest warrant for Akman for fraud 
charges connected to the Deniz Feneri investigation. 
 
Papers also report the Turkish Union of Notaries filed a legal 
complaint against notary Ismet Buyukkilic, who falsely notarized an 
authorization on behalf of Mehmet Gurhan, the ringleader of the 
German-based Deniz Feneri fraud scandal.  Gurhan was in prison in 
Germany at the time notary Buyukkilic issued the authorization in 
Istanbul on behalf of Gurhan.  The authorization in question granted 
Zekeriya Karaman, the president of Islamist-oriented Kanal 7 TV, to 
handle Gurhan's assets in Turkey. 
 
Secretary Rice's Op-Ed on Russia in Milliyet 
Secretary Rice's Op-Ed on Russia was carried today in mainstream 
Milliyet.  Under the front-page banner headline, "Rice Writes to 
Milliyet," in order to send "Clear Messages to Russian Leaders," the 
paper features the entire Op-Ed in the international news section 
under the headline, "We Will Not Submit to Russia's Swaggering 
Toughness." 
 
Journalist Punished for interviewing PKK Terrorists 
Mainstream Milliyet and Islamist-oriented Zaman report that Hurriyet 
editors Necdet Tatlican and Hasan Kilic, along with correspondent 
Sebati Karakurt, were fined 40,000 YTL each by the Istanbul 10th 
Heavy Penalty Court.  The charges against the media professionals 
were for "spreading propaganda for the PKK terrorist organization 
through press and publication." In 2004, correspondent Sebati 
Karakurt interviewed some members of the PKK terrorist organization 
on Kandil Mountain and this interview was published in Hurriyet's 
Sunday supplement on October 10, 2004. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Global Economic Meltdown, UNGA, Terrorism 
 
Ferai Tinc wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "Nothing will ever be the 
same again after this current economic crisis.  Some call it 
America's 'fiscal 9/11.' For example, the U.S. Congress now seeks 
more detailed accounting of the Pentagon's expenditures.  There is a 
consensus about the post-Bush period - no matter who wins the 
presidential elections, Iraq and Afghanistan will be a burden for 
the country." 
 
Fehmi Koru wrote in Islamist-leaning Yeni Safak: "Turkey is lobbying 
heavily for membership to the UN Security Council. Rival candidates 
Iceland and Austria rely on the potential support from specific 
blocs; Iceland is relying on the Scandinavian bloc while Austria is 
relying on the EU bloc.  Unlike these two, Turkey is lobbying with 
all of the UN members across the board.  Turkish diplomats are 
optimistic Turkey will win, although they don't take it for 
granted." 
 
Mustafa Balbay in leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet: "The PKK terror 
organization lures young people, especially those aged 14-18.  Every 
reasonable person, including terror experts, sees a need to prevent 
young people from joining the organization.  The government enacted 
seven laws aimed at convincing organization members not involved in 
armed violence to return home.  Turkey, on the one hand, tries to 
keep its people from becoming PKK terrorists, while on the other, 
breeds a brand new terrorist organization [i.e. Ergenekon] into all 
segments of the society."
