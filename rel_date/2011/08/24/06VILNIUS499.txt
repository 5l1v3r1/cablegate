We delivered reftel points to Head of the MFA's NATO Division 
Vytautas Leskevicius May 24.  Leskevicius told us that on May 
15 the MFA had recommended that the GOL contribute 50,000 
euros to the NATO Training Mission in Iraq for 2006, the same 
amount it contributed in 2005.  According to Leskevicius, the 
Ministry of Finance will probably approve the recommendation 
before the June defense ministerial in Brussels.
