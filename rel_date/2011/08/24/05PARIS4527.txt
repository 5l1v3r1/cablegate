¶1. Post shared the USG draft UNGA and UNSC resolutions with 
MFA IO UN reform action officer Nicolas Kassianides, who told 
us June 28 that the GoF was actively considering how to move 
forward on establishing the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC). 
 
¶2. Kassianides thanked us for the draft resolutions and said 
that the USG and GoF positions on the PBC were "very close." 
NOTE:  In Ambassador Tahir-Kheli's June 15 meetings with 
French officials, MFA Political Director Laboulaye expressed 
support for the establishment of the PBC, and IO 
A/S-equivalent Ripert agreed that the PBC's actions should be 
controlled by the UNSC (Ref C, para 3).  END NOTE.
