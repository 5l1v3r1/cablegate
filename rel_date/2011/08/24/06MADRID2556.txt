SUBJECT: SPAIN CONDEMNS NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR TEST 
 
REF: SECSTATE 169418 
 
¶1.  DCM passed reftel points October 10 to MFA Rafael 
Dezcallar, Director General for Policy.  ESTHOFF 
doubletracked same points with MFA Disarmament Affairs Deputy 
Director General Ignacio Sanchez.  Given that the GOS had 
publicly condemned the North Korean nuclear test on October 9 
(see below), DCM and ESTHOFF urged their interlocutors to 
implement expeditiously and completely all requirements 
contained in the expected UNSCR denouncing the test. 
 
¶2.  Begin informal Embassy translation of the MFA October 9 
statement on the North Korean nuclear test:  "The Government 
of Spain condemns that the DPRK, ignoring the warning of the 
international community contained in UNSCR 1695, has carried 
out the nuclear test that it had announced several days 
earlier via its state press agency.  This grave provocation 
will isolate the DPRK even more and can only serve to hurt 
the North Korean people.  The Government of Spain views, with 
grave preoccupation, the alteration in the regional balance 
in northeast Asia caused by this test, as well as the effects 
it can have on international peace and security.  The 
Government of Spain requests that the Government of the DPRK 
return immediately to the six-party talks in order to 
implement the accords of September 19, 2005.  The Government 
of Spain remains in close contacts with its EU partners to 
study the measures that will applied in this case."  End text 
of MFA statement. 
 
¶3.  Spanish Foreign Minister Moratinos made comments to the 
press October 9 which basically repeated the language of the 
above communique.  In brief, he characterized the test as a 
"grave provocation" and indicated that he would consult with 
his EU partners regarding "the measures" that would be 
adopted in response  Moratinos also called for North Korea to 
return to the six-party talks. 
 
¶4.  Deputy Foreign Minister Bernadino Leon, during an October 
9 meeting with visiting Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister 
Masakazu Sekiguchi, also expressed the GOS' "preoccupation" 
with the test and noted that it had already "been condemned 
by Foreign Minister Moratinos in the name of Prime Minister 
Zapatero." Sekiguchi reportedly characterized the test as a 
"threat to peace and security" in east Asia and said it was 
"indispensable" that North Korea return to the six-party 
talks.
