Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with statements by Israeli 
Foreign Minister Lieberman on April 1, stating that he has no 
intention of abiding by the Annapolis agreement. According to 
reports that also appear in Al-Quds' front page, Lieberman considers 
only the 2003 U.S. Road Map to be a valid document.  Al-Ayyam's 
front page cites a wire report quoting former Israeli Foreign 
Minister Livni commenting that Lieberman's statements reinforced her 
belief that Kadima was correct in not joining a coalition Likud 
government and that the two-state solution remains the only option 
for peace.  In U.S. reaction to Lieberman's statement, Al-Quds cites 
DPA on its front page in noting that the U.S. will continue to 
support the two-state solution. 
 
In lead photos, Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida run photos of 
emotional Palestinian families in Jerusalem and Nablus protesting 
the detention of loved ones in Israeli detention centers and 
prisons.  Meanwhile, Al-Quds leads with a photo from the G20 summit 
showing protesters in London holding Palestinian flags and signs 
reading, "Free Palestine, End Gaza Siege, YES WE CAN." 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's front page cites an AFP report that quotes 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas calling on the international 
community to urge Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to accept the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state.  In related news, 
Al-Quds front pages a wire report about European leaders calling on 
the new Israeli government to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict 
by proceeding towards the establishment of an independent 
Palestinian state. 
 
Al-Quds leads with news that the Jerusalem Municipality plans to 
impose fines and penalties on landlords who own properties without 
required permits.  The report indicates that fines will also be 
imposed on tenants who rent in "illegal" buildings.  The report adds 
that Palestinian officials responded during an April 1 press 
conference in Ramallah, calling the measures, "political in nature" 
and a move that will, "deepen hatred and bias" against Palestinians 
residing in Jerusalem. 
 
All front pages offer more detail on the previously reported news 
that Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad will remain in office 
until a new government is formed.  According to an AFP report cited 
on Al-Quds' front page, Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad will 
remain in office in order to avoid a constitutional gap during Cairo 
unity talks.  Fayyad expressed his hopes that the talks will end in 
the formation of a national consensus government. 
 
All three dailies front page reports about Palestinian national 
dialogue in Cairo.  Reports repeat explanations that the third round 
of talks will focus on resolving questions related to legislative 
and presidential elections based on proportional representation, 
formation of a transitional government, security, and the PLO as 
sole legal representative of the Palestinians.  In related news, 
Al-Quds' front page runs the results of a recent opinion poll 
conducted by Near East Consulting that shows that 56% of 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza believe that the current 
dialogue between Hamas and Fatah will succeed in achieving national 
unity and end the division between the West Bank and Gaza.  The poll 
further shows that Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti would likely win in 
new elections for the Palestinian Authority President.  Meanwhile, 
Al-Ayyam's inside page reports on a poll conducted by Norwegian FAFO 
that shows that 93% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza 
 
JERUSALEM 00000599  002 OF 002 
 
 
support the continuation of national dialogue aimed at forming a 
unity government. 
 
In economic news, Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad signed an 
agreement with the UN's International Fund for Agricultural 
Development on April 1, which includes support to the Palestinian 
Authority in the amount of $5 million for agricultural sector 
projects in the Palestinian Territories. 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida report on their inside pages about 
the 3rd Career Day for Girls that took place in Ramallah on April 1, 
co-sponsored by the U.S Consulate General and Young Entrepreneurs 
Palestine organization.  According to coverage, 200 girls from local 
high schools participated in the event that provided them an 
opportunity to explore future career aspirations.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
 1) Abdallah Awwad opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "We know what Tel-Aviv proposes, now what do we 
propose?"(04/02):  "Netanyahu was clear in presenting the political 
agenda of his government:  [Israel] does not envision a state for 
the Palestinians... only autonomy... [Israel] will not halt 
settlement activities, and will not end occupation.  Still, 
[Netanyahu] will pursue peace with the Palestinians.  What kind of 
peace, we haven't a clue... Why don't Palestinians put their 
national interests first and agree on a government?  Why is our 
enemy united and we are not?  It is because Israeli parties care 
about Israeli national interests first and not about the interests 
of internal factions, the way Palestinians do.  We must wait until 
we can unite as Palestinians ...in order to unite as Palestinians, 
we must wait for Arab leaders to unite and agree on a common policy, 
and then wait for Arabs to form the strongest lobby to pressure the 
United States and the White House to deal firmly with Israel... all 
we can do is wait and God will send his blessings!" 
 
2) Al-Hayat Al Jadida official daily runs an editorial by Yahya 
Rubbah under the title, "Netanyahu changes the rules of the 
game"(04/02):  "... Benjamin Netanyahu takes the lead of the 
so-called Israeli government which was elected by the Israeli people 
who have come to blindly support extremist right-wing parties, and 
all this changes the rules of the game.  Among the new rules are: 
no Palestinian state, no withdrawal from East Jerusalem, no return 
of refugees... When Israel changes the rules, there is no point to 
playing according to the old rules.  This is clearly demonstrated in 
the so-called "unity talks" in Cairo... There is no logic to 
continued Palestinian division... what mechanisms have we developed 
for resistance efforts???"
