This is CWC-53-09 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request: see para 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During the July session of the OPCW's 
Executive Council (EC), Delrep Granger was elected 
to chair consultations on financial matters (ref 
A).  Also with the new leadership of the Executive 
Council that began in July, Iran, representing the 
Asian Group, holds the EC Vice-Chair for 
Administrative and Financial Matters.  As reported 
in Ref B, new Iranian Deputy Permanent 
Representative Mahmoud Esfananinejad has stated his 
intention to take on the role of Vice-Chairperson 
actively. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Given that Delrep's consultations fall 
under the Vice-Chairperson for Administrative and 
Financial Matters, Delrep is required to report to 
Esfananinejad and to work with members of the 
Iranian delegation in reporting back to the EC on 
progress made in the consultations.  Therefore, Del 
requests Department guidance on how Delrep may 
communicate and interact with members of the 
Iranian Delegation to the OPCW to fulfill his 
mandate.
