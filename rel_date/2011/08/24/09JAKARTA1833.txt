SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S COURTESY CALL ON NEW MINISTER OF 
TRANSPORTATION FREDDY NUMBERI 
 
REF: A. JAKARTA 1227 
¶B. JAKARTA 1619 
 
¶1.  On November 3, Ambassador Hume and newly-appointed Minister of 
Transportation Freddy Numberi discussed Indonesia's desire to 
improve railroad and aviation infrastructure and possibilities for 
expanding mutual cooperation in those strategic areas.  Numberi, 
Minister of Oceans and Fisheries during President Yudhoyono's first 
term, welcomed deepening U.S.- Indonesia bilateral relations. 
 
¶2.  Minister Numberi highlighted the railway system as a key area 
for investment and improvement during President Yudhoyono's second 
term, and referenced the GoI's positive experiences with General 
Electric (GE)(Ref A).  The Ambassador told Numberi he has encouraged 
GE to take a long-range view of Indonesia, and to seek more 
opportunities to invest and develop capacity here.  Numberi was 
especially interested in obtaining technical assistance on urban 
planning issues, including public transportation, road load, and 
construction of ring roads.  He said a big picture strategy would be 
very helpful, if GE could provide such a plan. 
 
¶3.  The Ambassador noted the recent helicopter deal between Bell and 
an Indonesian state-owned enterprise, which incorporates in-country 
fabrication.  He stressed that Indonesia has an enormous demand for 
all types of aircraft and could work towards developing local 
production capacity to meet those needs.  Numberi was aware of 
Boeing's strong position in the Indonesian market, counting both 
Garuda and Lion Air as major clients. The Ambassador emphasized 
support for helping Indonesia regain Federal Aviation Authority 
Category-1 status to resume flights to the U.S.(Ref B).  He noted 
that a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) technical 
assistance visit is planned for January 2010.   Numberi hopes to 
travel to the U.S. next year, something he did not have a chance to 
do in his previous Ministerial capacity.
