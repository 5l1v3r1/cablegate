"The Alliance" 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (2-10) by Janio de Freitas 
states: "The alliance between Brazil-France is already showing 
friction in its first test....and both sides are taking positions 
[regarding Iran] that are not only different but 
contradictory......despite sanctions and threats against Iran, 
uranium enrichment at 20% is far from the needed levels to have the 
nuclear warhead that Americans and Europeans say Iran aims for. 
Brazil, for instance, which for the time being is only authorized 
enrichment at low ranges, intends to request for higher 
authorizations at the UN, as it will need, in the future, the same 
20% or even more.  And this would not only be for peaceful means, 
from the perspective of the nuclear submarine.....[Recent facts] 
suggest.....it is a strategy of an alliance only for business 
purposes."
