SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (08/19): Palestinians continue to 
call for a full settlement freeze; Dailies feature Consul General's 
farewell interview 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
President Barack Obama's meeting with Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak on August 18 receives front page coverage in the local 
press. Obama expressed his optimism about reaching a peace agreement 
between the Palestinians and Israel, and called on the Arab states 
and Palestinians to take confidence-building steps in order to pave 
the way for a peace agreement in the region. Mubarak reiterated that 
the Arab states won't take any steps towards normalizing relations 
with Israel unless the latter completely halts all settlement 
activity. 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam front page and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs inside 
page coverage on Consul General Jake Walles' exit interview with the 
three dailies on August 17. Walles spoke about his experience as the 
Consul General and the friendships that he built over the past four 
years. Walles praised the economic and security improvements 
throughout the West Bank under the leadership of Palestinian 
Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 
and expressed his optimism about achieving an independent 
Palestinian state in the next two years. Walles reiterated that 
achieving peace in the Middle East is a priority for President 
Obama, and that he will remain engaged until it is achieved. The CG 
stressed that the US calls for a complete freeze on settlement 
activity and home demolitions. Walles noted that the Sixth Fatah 
Party Congress was an internal Palestinian affair, and said that he 
did not intervene in its proceedings. Regarding Hamas, Walles 
clearly indicated that if Hamas wants to have a role in the 
political solution, it has to accept the Quartet principles. 
Finally, Walles urged all Palestinians "not to lose hope." 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page news citing Wafa and Israeli daily Maariv 
quoting Israeli right wing ministers noting on August 18 during 
their visit to settlements in the West Bank that "the settlements 
are legal and the construction will continue everywhere." 
 
Al-Quds front pages news that an Egyptian security delegation 
conducted a series of meetings on August 18 in Ramallah with 
representatives from Hamas and Fatah in preparation for the next 
round of national unity and reconciliation talks scheduled for 
August 25 in Cairo. ------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, "We 
don't need good intentions, we need implementation" (08/19): "What's 
important at this stage is not to show good intentions or repeat the 
same statements. What counts is how to implement the vision of the 
international community, how to force Israel to halt settlement 
activity, how to prove the US administration's credibility and 
seriousness about achieving peace, and how to prove its commitment 
to putting an end to the conflicts in the region." 
 
2) Omar Hilmi Al-Ghoul opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under 
the headline "Did Israel freeze settlement construction?" (08/19): 
"The Israeli game won't deceive the US or the EU anymore ... All 
l 
international players must force Israel to freeze settlement 
activity now and forever. They all have the power to make Israel 
abide by these demands and respect international law in order to 
 
JERUSALEM 00001465  002 OF 002 
 
 
rescue the peace process."
