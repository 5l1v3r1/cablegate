¶1. (SBU) Summary: UNMIS Police Commissioner Vittrup told poloff 
January 31 that the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) Civilian Police Unit 
wants to address the current lack of southern Sudanese police 
capacity by improving the quality and quantity of police training. 
He said civilian police can play a vital role in election security. 
End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Vittrup said that UNMIS Civilian Police (CIVPOLS) work with 
the entire police structure in Sudan including those in the North 
and the South.  He said that the police in the North are relatively 
professional and are capable of basic aspects of modern policing 
such as disposal of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and riot 
control.  However, the Southern Sudanese Police Services (SSPS) has 
some serious deficiencies that UNMIS would like to help address.  On 
a scale of zero to 100 (with 100 being most effective), the SSPS 
scored a 15 in a recent UNMIS CIVPOL assessment. "They scored zero 
in almost every area except arrests," said Vittrup. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The GOSS says there are 40,000 former SPLA soldiers who 
have transitioned into the SSPS, but UNMIS can only account for 
17,463, according to Vittrup. Many of the SSPS do not have any 
training in policing, and the training is unevenly distributed. 
While the highest-ranking officers are very highly trained, the 
street officers have no training whatsoever in policing.  Currently 
the UN CIVPOLS provide a three-month training program to only 40 
SSPS officers at a time.  At this rate of training, noted Vittrup, 
it would take 12 years to provide training to all of the current 
SSPS police. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Vittrup said that most of the 675 CIVPOLS work alongside 
SSPS to provide on-the-job training to them.  However, he noted that 
the harsh realities of the operating environment in the South impede 
effective training efforts.  For example, a donor has offered 120 
police cars to the South, but few of the police are able to drive, 
there are no maintenance facilities, there is no way to license the 
cars or the drivers, and there is no fuel budget for the SSPS. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Vittrup would also like to improve the capacity of UNMIS to 
provide specialist police training.  Vittrup noted that civilian 
police forces often have within their services specialists in the 
use of non-lethal force. UNMIS wants to recruit police officers who 
are specialists in areas such as riot control, to replace some of 
the generalists UNMIS has up to now. Vittrup added that UNMIS is 
seeking donors to provide funding for additional trainers so it can 
train a greater number of SSPS officers more quickly. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: There are additional obstacles to effective UNMIS 
police training in Sudan, such as the lack of a revised National 
Police Act and turf battles among UN agencies.  The rollout of INL 
programming in the South comes as a fortuitous opportunity.  GOSS 
Regional Cooperation Minister Barnabas Marial Benjamin signed the 
Criminal Justice Sector Assistance MOU after an enthusiastic review 
by GOSS Legal Affairs Minister Michael Makuei and Internal Affairs 
Minister Paul Mayom.  Mayom's ministry oversees the SSPS.  He in 
particular was supportive of the Department's language regarding 
elections security training for police - and particularly what it 
holds for the further demarcation of duties between the SPLA and 
SSPS.
