¶1. (U) SUMMARY: WFP officials report observing an estimated 
5,000-20,000 refugees and assumed asylum-seekers in urban areas 
of Djibouti--a significant burden on a country whose total 
population numbers approximately 600,000.  To address the 
growing number of refugees crossing into Djibouti from the 
border with Somaliland, the GoDJ has allowed UNHCR to construct 
a reception site at Loyada.  The GoDJ is also expected to 
promulgate a new presidential decree pertaining to the 
operations of the National Eligibility Office, which is mandated 
to review applications for refugee status and resettlement in 
Djibouti.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) A high-level mission from WFP Geneva (meeting July 12? 
16 with donor representatives and GoDJ officials to discuss the 
GoDJ?s decision to expel the WFP country director for Djibouti, 
REF A) reported observing an estimated 5,000-20,000 refugees and 
asylum-seekers in urban areas of Djibouti.  The team visited 
areas and populations severely affected by the drought and 
soaring food prices.  According to UNHCR, in many urban areas 
visited, the WFP mission observed urban refugees who do not 
receive assistance; registered asylum-seekers (non-Somalis) 
resident in Djibouti, but whose claims have not yet been 
determined for over five years; and persons who are waiting to 
be listed for individual status determination. 
 
¶3. (U) Separately, the GoDJ approved plans allowing UNCHR to 
build a reception site near the Somalia border, to process newly 
arrived refugees.  Construction began early July and is expected 
to be completed by mid-August.  On July 19, Post?s Refugee 
Officer visited the site with UNCHR Representative Ann Encontre. 
The site is located inside Djibouti, 0.5 km from the Djiboutian 
police checkpoint at Loyada, near Djibouti?s border with 
Somaliland.  Initially, UNHCR requested permission to build the 
site in the no-man?s-land between the Somaliland and Djibouti 
borders.  The Ministry of Interior agreed; however, the Ministry 
of Defense reportedly blocked the request, for unknown reasons. 
 
¶4. (U) On July 21, the GoDJ reinstituted its National 
Eligibility Office, which had been inactive for five years.  The 
office?s mandate is to make refugee status determinations, 
therefore allowing non-Djiboutians to resettle in Djibouti.  In 
2000, the GoDJ signed a decree to create this body and a 
commission to oversee its work; however, standard operational 
procedures were not developed, and the office failed to 
function.  According to UNHCR, Djibouti?s president is expected 
to sign a new draft decree this week.  UNHCR has drafted a 
standard operating procedure to present to the GoDJ after the 
signing of the decree, to help ensure that the National 
Eligibility office functions properly. 
 
¶5. (U) COMMENT.  These steps by the Government of Djibouti 
highlight the growing burden (REF D) that refugees--primarily 
from Somalia--are placing on the smallest country in the Horn of 
Africa.   Conducting a census to identify the total number of 
alien individuals in urban areas, determining their proper 
status, and taking subsequent action to resettle or integrate 
them remain challenges to be addressed by the GoDJ and its 
partners.
