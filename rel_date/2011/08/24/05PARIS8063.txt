¶1.  (U)  Embassy received research clearance for the subject 
vessel (Reftel A) from the MFA under cover of diplomatic 
note number 1441/AME dated 24 November 2005.  The note 
states that the French authorities have no objection to the 
research campaign of the Corwith Cramer in the French waters 
of the Guadeloupe and Martinique from 26 November 2005 to 4 
January 2006. The note further states that local authorities 
have been informed. 
 
¶2.  (U)  The note further indicates that the French 
authorities do not wish that "heavy seismic operations" be 
conducted during the research program.  The note also 
underscores the necessity for research vessel, throughout 
its program, to (A) pay specific attention not to harm 
fishing equipment left in the place within the French waters 
by professional fishermen, and (B) to be in radio contact 
with fishing boats which are located in the surrounding 
proximity to inform them of R/V's research campaign 
movement. 
 
¶3.  (U)  The note also states that the ship must inform 
French authorities of its entrance into and exit from the 
French waters (info to be sent to:  Bureau Emploi Mer/Emia; 
Tel: 00 33 (0) 5 96 39 51 63 - Fax: 00 33 (0) 5 96 39 51 
65), and inform them should buoys be deployed for 
measurements (position, GDH)). 
 
¶4.  (U)  Finally, the MFA requests three/three copies of 
both the preliminary and post cruise report.
