¶1.  (SBU) PolOff faxed RefTel points on September 15 and 
followed up with a telephone call on September 19 to MFA 
Director for Multilateral Affairs, Miguel Mendez, requesting 
that the GOE consider referring Iran to the UN Security 
Council.  PolOff mentioned that the Secretary had raised this 
issue with President Palacio at their recent meeting in New 
York (ref B).  Mendez said he understood USG concerns over 
Iran's actions, but added that the GOE still has not taken a 
position on the UNSC referral.  However, Mendez again 
stressed that the GOE supports full, transparent dialogue on 
Iran, adding that they will only consider UNSC referral when 
all other diplomatic means are exhausted.
