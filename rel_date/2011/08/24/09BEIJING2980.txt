China-Africa Forum 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. Asked about China's expectations for the 4th Ministerial 
Conference of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) to be 
held in early November in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, MFA spokesperson 
Ma Zhaoxu replied that Egypt was the first African-Arab country to 
establish ties with China and that this year marked the 10th 
anniversary of Sino-Egypt strategic and cooperative ties.  China 
looked to further deepen its pragmatic links with Egypt and to 
promote China-Africa and China-Arab relations.  China expected the 
4th Ministerial Conference to build off cooperative results since 
the 2006 Beijing Summit and 3rd Ministerial Conference.  The meeting 
would be of great significance to advancing China-African relations 
and to strengthening joint cooperation across the board.  Ma added 
that one could expect to see cooperative agreements signed, the 
issuance of a FOCAC Sharm el-Sheikh declaration, and a 2010-2012 
Action Plan meant to guide the future course of bilateral relations 
and as a blueprint for cooperative efforts for the next three years. 
 Turning to aid, Ma stated that China's aid to African countries 
would be continuous and long-term.  China and Africa would continue 
to exchange views on trade and economic cooperation "so as to reach 
a new consensus." 
 
Iran 
----- 
 
¶3. Asked for China's position on Iranian press articles calling for 
cooperation and fuel supply from China, Ma responded that 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohamed 
ElBaradei had put forward a proposal for the supply of fuel to 
Iran's nuclear reactors.  China hoped the parties through 
consultations would reach a consensus at an early date. 
 
Executions of Tibetans 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. Asked whether China had executed two Tibetans convicted of 
involvement in the March 14 incident, Ma confirmed that "two 
criminals had been executed."  Regarding the March 14 convictions, 
PRC authorities had strictly followed Chinese criminal law and legal 
procedures, Ma added.  Lawyers of the defendants fully expressed 
their views, Tibetan interpreters were provided, ensuring the 
legitimate rights of the defendants were guaranteed.  The cases were 
handled according to law and the trials were reviewed and approved 
by the Supreme People's Court.  Ma referred the journalist to 
China's judicial authorities for more thorough answers. 
 
U.S. Embargo on Cuba 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. Asked for China's position on the U.S. embargo on Cuba, Ma stated 
that the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) held a vote on 
lifting the U.S. embargo.  China's position was that all countries 
should abide by the UN charter, and that state-to-state relations 
should be based on equality and mutual respect.  China maintained 
that the embargo should be lifted at an early date. 
 
ROK Veteran to DPRK 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. Asked for information on the 81-year old Republic of Korea (ROK) 
veteran, Choi Sung-yong, arrested by Chinese authorities after 
escaping from 57 years of captivity in North Korea, Ma replied that 
he had no specific information on this case.  Regarding "illegal 
border crossers," China followed international law and humanitarian 
principles.

China Espionage Case 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. Asked to comment on the U.S. arrest of a Chinese national, former 
Ford Motor Company engineer Yu Xiangdong, on charges of espionage, 
Ma replied that he was not aware of case specifics but noted that 
China was closely following this case to ensure that the national's 
rights were guaranteed.  China's Consul General in Chicago had 
already sent officers to visit Yu according to the regulations of 
China-U.S. Consular Treaty. 
 
Principle of Non-interference 
------------------------------ 
 
¶8. Asked whether China's increasingly active role in world affairs 
was consistent with China's policy of noninterference in other 
countries' internal policies, Spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu told the 
journalist that his question "should be raised in academic 
seminars."  China adopted an independent foreign policy consistent 
with its path of peaceful development and the building of a 
harmonious world, Ma added. China would continue to play a positive 
and cooperative role in world affairs and in building a harmonious 
world.  China's principle of non-interference was universally 
acknowledged and was in line with its five principles of peaceful 
coexistence. 
 
U.S. Plane in Guangdong 
------------------------ 
 
¶9. Responding to the reported discovery of a U.S. B-29 bomber that 
had crashed in Guangdong Province on November 5, 1950 -- shortly 
before China's attack on U.S. troops in Korea -- Ma replied that he 
had no information on the matter and would get back to the 
journalist.
