SUBJECT:  USUNESCO - AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE EXHIBIT INAUGURATION 
 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: On October 3, UNESCO Director-General Koichiro Matsuura 
joined Ambassador Oliver and architectural historian & photographer 
John Margolies, to inaugurate the "American Roadside Architecture" 
exhibit at UNESCO Headquarters.  The exhibit featured over 50 
photographs of mid-twentieth century American roadside buildings, as 
well as framed U.S. tourist maps from Margolies' personal 
collection.   The opening reception was a lively event, with a DJ 
who played American 50s-60s music and a vintage 1956 Chrysler 
contributing to the evening's upbeat, nostalgic feel.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  The Director General made enthusiastic opening remarks, 
recalling a memorable cross-country road trip he made during his 
college years in the U.S., and subsequently issued a very positive 
press release about the exhibit. Others in attendance, including the 
Austrian ambassador and his wife, also said the photos brought back 
fond memories of U.S. travels.  The exhibit, which ran for two 
weeks, provided an excellent occasion to showcase some of the best 
and most amusing aspects of uniquely American architecture. 
 
¶3. COMMENT: Held on the eve of the Executive Board, the opening 
reception also gave the U.S. Mission an opportunity to connect with 
UNESCO counterparts, and discuss key policy issues in a relaxed 
setting.   The largest event hosted by the U.S. Mission outside of 
July 4th, the reception was attended by many UNESCO ambassadors and 
staff.  Deputy Assistant Secretary Colleen Graffy, who was also 
present, echoed the general consensus in declaring the evening a big 
success. END COMMENT
