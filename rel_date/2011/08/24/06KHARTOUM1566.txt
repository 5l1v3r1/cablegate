SUBJECT: SUDAN:  MINNI MINAWI'S THOUGHTS ON HIS TRIP TO 
WASHINGTON 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The following report is from Tod Wilson, with 
Minawi in Dafur. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Summary:  Minni indicated that he was bringing an 
eclectic group consisting of political officials, 
businessmen, military and civil servants.  He said that the 
visit should not extend past 10 days.  Minni desires to focus 
his agenda on government officials, Congress, USAID and 
meeting the Darfurian expatriate community.  Minni has not 
been in touch with his US point of contact, but intends to 
do.  He has still not finalized the female delegate position. 
End Summary. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Minni quickly reviewed the his delegate list and 
stated that his visit would need to accommodate a wide array 
of officials from SLM party political officials and civil 
servants, SLA military officers and Darfurian businessmen. 
40 percent of the list (mostly politicians and businessmen) 
consists of officials living outside of Sudan. The senior 
military officers on the list have little to no formal 
military training. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Minni did not commit to a specific time period for 
his stay.  He stated that the length of his visit would be 
based on his program. When queried on the maximum time he 
could spend, Minni indicated that he thought none of his 
party should stay more than 10 days. He appeared emphatic on 
this time period.  In previous discussions he stated that he 
would not attend the July 18 Brussels AMIS donors meeting 
given their technical nature and did not plan on cutting his 
trip short to attend the Egyptian hosted Arab League donors 
meetings on July 27. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Minni is considering assembling the entire group 
in Cairo for two days enroute to organize for the visit.  Del 
members in Sudan can fly to Cairo with a two day lay over and 
then on to their final destination by July 22. Others would 
fly from their present locations.  We assume for those flying 
from Sudan a fund cite will be provided for tickets and those 
flying from other locations will be reimbursed separately. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Minni is counting heavily on Washington to develop 
a tentative program, including with Darfurian expats and 
Congressional offices, that he can then comment upon.  He 
promised to contact his POC in Washington asap.  In addition 
to official calls, members of the group may benefit from some 
civil society organization training, political party 
development discussions, and small business enterprise 
discussions.  Additional options for training could be 
designed for members of his group according to what their 
roles will be in DPA implementation. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Minni plans to depart for Egypt on July 5 and will 
return to Darfur in 3 or 4 days, after which he plans to come 
to Khartoum.
