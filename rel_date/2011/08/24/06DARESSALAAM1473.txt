RESOLUTION 
 
REF: A. STATE 142509 
     ¶B. USUN 1660 
 
¶1.  (U)  Co-sponsorship of the draft UN Security Council 
resolution on Darfur is "under serious consideration" by 
Tanzania, Ambassador Liberata Mulamula, Director of the 
Department of Multilateral Cooperation in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, told Poloff August 30.  Poloff inquired as 
to whether instructions had been sent from the capital to New 
York and Mulamula said the Tanzanian delegation in New York 
just received the draft resolution and she expects 
instructions to be sent from the capital shortly.  Mulamula 
and Poloff agreed to discuss the issue again at OOB August 
¶31. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  COMMENT: "Seriously considering" co-sponsoring the 
resolution indicates there is a real possibility of Tanzanian 
co-sponsorship.  Post will press the Tanzanians again at OOB 
August 31 when they have the final text of the resolution in 
hand.  The DCM subsequently followed up with Ambassador 
Mulamula, emphasizing the importance the United States 
attaches to this resolution and Tanzanian co-sponsorship.
