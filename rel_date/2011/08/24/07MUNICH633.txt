¶1.  ConGen Munich contacted Deutsches Zentrum f|r Luft und Raumfahrt 
(DLR) in Wessling and received the confirmation that it had ordered 
two detectors from Fermionics Corporation.  DLR informed us that it 
had not physically received the detectors, as the Australian firm 
Integrated Spectronics Pty Ltd. was presently integrating one 
detector into an aerial camera, and the second detector is to be 
held by Integrated Spectronics as a spare.  Once the detector is 
mounted in the camera, it will be shipped to Germany and used for 
environmental monitoring by DLR. 
 
¶2.  DLR is a reputable organization, and ConGen Munich is confident 
the information provided by DLR is accurate to the best of DLR's 
knowledge. 
 
¶3.  This report has been coordinated with Embassy Berlin. 
 
¶4.  Previous reporting from Munich is available on our SIPRNET 
website at www.state.sgov.gov/p/eur/munich/ .
