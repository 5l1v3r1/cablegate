Â¶1.  (SBU) MFA Human Rights Department Desk Officer Dirk 
Sander informed Poloff October 26 that Germany agrees with 
the U.S. position to oppose no-action motions and intends to 
do likewise.  He said that Germany intends to support the 
three country-specific resolutions (reftel): on Iran, Burma, 
and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  In addition, 
Germany will support the U.S. elections resolution.  Sander 
said Germany agrees with the U.S. and opposes the defamation 
of religion resolution sponsored by the Organization of the 
Islamic Conference.
