REF: PRETORIA 1460 
 
 
¶1. (U) Press reports indicate the legal saga of ANC President 
Jacob Zuma and his illicit arms deals with former financial 
adviser Schabir Shaik continues.  While Germany dropped its 
probe into ThyssenKrupp, a German arms manufacturer, and its 
deal in the late 1990s involving ANC President Zuma (reftel), 
the footprint of illicit deals has followed Zuma to Mauritius 
where another legal action is underway. This case involves 
Thint, a French arms manufacturer, and evidence that was used 
to convict Schabir Shaik, former defense procurer and 
financial adviser to Zuma. Zuma's legal team sought to secure 
13 documents in an effort to prepare Zuma for his August 4 
court summons in South Africa. 
 
¶2. (U) The South African National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) 
application to the Mauritius Independent Commission Against 
Corruption to secure the contested original documents will 
continue unmolested by Zuma's legal team.  The ANC president 
had requested permission to be involved in the NPA's 
application process in Mauritius, but was denied by the 
Mauritius Supreme Court. The Supreme Court determined that 
the NPA's request for the documents, including a diary from 
2000 of Thint's chief executive allegedly detailing bribe 
amounts and a meeting with Zuma and Shaik to discuss the 
bribe, does not jeopardize Zuma's trial rights.
