SUBJECT:  LEBANON: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 201772 
 
¶1.  SECURITY CONDITIONS IN LEBANON WORSENED DURING 2002 WITH 
THE KILLING OF AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY, EXPLOSIONS AT SEVERAL 
AMERICAN FRANCHISE RESTAURANTS, AND A SPIKE OF CROSS-BORDER 
ATTACKS INTO ISRAEL IN MARCH-APRIL.  LEBANON, LIKE MANY 
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, IS EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE IN 
TERRORIST EVENTS BY SUNNI EXTREMIST GROUPS. 
 
¶2.  THE GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON (GOL) REMAINS UNABLE TO EXERT 
CONTROL IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING PORTIONS 
OF THE BIQ'A VALLEY, SOUTH LEBANON, THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS OF 
BEIRUT, AND THE PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS.  EASY ACCESS TO 
ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES CONTINUES TO BE CONDUCIVE TO THE 
POTENTIAL FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM.  SYRIAN AND IRANIAN SUPPORT 
FOR HIZBALLAH "RESISTANCE" ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH, AS WELL 
AS ASSISTANCE TO HIZBALLAH AND PALESTINIAN GROUPS IN 
LEBANON, HELP PERMIT TERRORIST ELEMENTS TO FLOURISH. 
SEVERAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN 
LEBANON, INCLUDING HIZBALLAH, PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD 
(PIJ), THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE - 
GENERAL COMMAND (PFLP-GC), HAMAS, THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION 
(ANO), ASBAT AL-ANSAR, AND SEVERAL SMALL LOCAL SUNNI 
EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
¶3.  DESPITE ITS LIMITED ABILITY TO COUNTER HIZBALLAH AND 
PALESTINIAN REJECTIONIST GROUPS, THE GOL HAS A FREER HAND IN 
DEALING WITH SUNNI EXTREMISM.  THE GOL HAS COOPERATED WITH 
THE U.S. IN COMBATING AL-QAIDA AND AFFILIATED LOCAL SUNNI 
EXTREMIST GROUPS SUCH AS ASBAT AL-ANSAR. 
 
¶4.  SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST-RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT TOOK PLACE 
IN LEBANON IN 2002 INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 
 
-- ON MARCH 12, INFILTRATORS FROM LEBANON KILLED SIX 
ISRAELIS IN SHELOMI, A TOWN IN NORTHERN ISRAEL. 
 
-- DURING THE PERIOD MARCH-APRIL, HIZBALLAH AND PALESTINIAN 
REJECTIONIST GROUPS PERPETRATED SEVERAL CROSS-BORDER ATTACKS 
INTO ISRAEL, INCLUDING THE FIRING OF KATYUSHA ROCKETS. 
 
-- ON APRIL 25, THERE WAS AN ABORTED ATTEMPT TO SET OFF AN 
EXPLOSION AT A PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT IN SHUWEIFAT (BEIRUT). 
 
-- ON MAY 9, AN EXPLOSION DAMAGED A KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN 
RESTAURANT IN TRIPOLI. 
 
-- ON JULY 11, A SUNNI EXTREMIST KILLED THREE LEBANESE ARMED 
FORCES (LAF) PERSONNEL IN SIDON AND FLED INTO THE NEARBY AIN 
EL-HILWEH PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP.  VARIOUS PALESTINIAN AND 
ISLAMIC GROUPS SUBSEQUENTLY FACILITATED THE HANDOVER OF THE 
SUSPECT TO THE GOL. 
 
-- ON SEPTEMBER 23, AN EXPLOSION IN A PARKING LOT ADJACENT 
TO THE MCDONALD'S IN JUNIEH, NEAR BEIRUT, DAMAGED SEVERAL 
VEHICLES. 
 
-- ON NOVEMBER 12, EXPLOSIONS DAMAGED PIZZA HUT RESTAURANTS 
IN TRIPOLI AND JUNIEH, AND A LOCAL FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT IN 
JUNIEH. 
 
-- ON NOVEMBER 21, AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY WAS SHOT AND 
KILLED IN SIDON. 
 
¶5.  ANSWERS THAT FOLLOW ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS IN REFTEL: 
 
A) THE GOL INFORMED THE EMBASSY THAT IT ARRESTED IN OCTOBER 
THREE SUSPECTED AL-QAIDA OPERATIVES.  THE INDIVIDUALS WERE 
ALLEGEDLY ATTEMPTING TO START AN AL-QAIDA TERRORIST CELL IN 
LEBANON.  THE GOL ALSO OFFERED COOPERATION WITH THE USG ON 
THE INVESTIGATION CONCERNING SEPTEMBER 11 HIJACKER ZIAD 
JARRAH (A LEBANESE NATIONAL). 
 
FROM JANUARY 1 THROUGH MID-NOVEMBER, THE SPECIAL 
INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION INVESTIGATED 113 CASES INVOLVING 
ALLEGATIONS OF MONEY LAUNDERING, 20 OF WHICH WERE RELATED TO 
TERRORIST FINANCING.  NO ACCOUNTS RELATED TO THE FINANCING 
OF TERRORISM WERE DISCOVERED IN LEBANESE BANKS AND FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS IN 2002. 
 
THE GOL AMENDED ITS LAW ON MONEY LAUNDERING AND ITS PENAL 
CODE THIS YEAR TO STRENGTHEN PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO COMBAT 
THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM.  THE AMENDMENT TO THE PENAL CODE 
PROVIDES FOR THREE TO SEVEN YEARS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE 
FOR ANY PERSON THAT CONTRIBUTES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO 
THE FINANCING OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR OPERATIONS. 
 
B) THE JUDICIARY IN OCTOBER INDICTED THREE MEN (TWO LEBANESE 
AND ONE SAUDI) AND 18 OTHERS IN ABSENTIA SUSPECTED OF AL- 
QAIDA CONNECTIONS, INCLUDING PLANNING TO TRAIN PERSONNEL TO 
CARRY OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THEY WERE ALSO CHARGED WITH 
FORGING DOCUMENTS AND PASSPORTS.  THE INDICTMENT CHARGED 
THEM ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 335 OF THE PENAL CODE, WHICH 
STIPULATES A SENTENCE OF NOT LESS THAN 15 YEARS 
IMPRISONMENT.  THE CASE WAS REFERRED TO THE MILITARY 
TRIBUNAL.  THE TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO START IN DECEMBER. 
 
FOLLOWING A SPATE OF ATTACKS ON AMERICAN FRANCHISE 
RESTAURANTS, THE GOL DISPATCHED LAF AND INTERNAL SECURITY 
FORCE (ISF) PERSONNEL TO PROTECT THESE FACILITIES ON A 24- 
HOUR BASIS.  THE GOL IS COOPERATING CLOSELY WITH U.S. 
OFFICIALS AND PROVIDING INFORMATION ON ITS INVESTIGATION OF 
THE MURDER OF A U.S. CITIZEN IN SIDON. 
 
C) THE GOL DID NOT EXTRADITE ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR 
PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR.  THE U.S. DID NOT REQUEST ANY 
NEW EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISM SUSPECTS OF THE GOL IN 2002. 
 
D) THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTING AND/OR 
EXTRADITING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN LEBANON.  LEBANESE LAWS 
PROHIBIT THE EXTRADITION OF ANY LEBANESE NATIONAL TO A THIRD 
COUNTRY.  THE LEBANESE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS INDEPENDENT IN 
PRINCIPLE, BUT SUBJECT TO POLITICAL PRESSURE (FROM 
INFLUENTIAL LEBANESE POLITICIANS, AS WELL AS SYRIAN LEADERS 
AND INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL) IN PRACTICE.  THE GOL 
ACKNOWLEDGES THE UN LIST OF TERRORIST GROUPS DESIGNATED 
PURSUANT TO UNSCR 1267/1390.  HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT 
ACKNOWLEDGE TERRORIST GROUPS DESIGNATED SOLELY BY THE USG 
AND WILL NOT TAKE ACTION AGAINST THESE GROUPS. 
 
TO DATE, A COURT HEARING IN THE APPEAL MADE BY THE 
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE REGARDING THE ASSASSINATION OF U.S. 
AMBASSADOR FRANCIS MELOY AND TWO OTHERS IN 1976 HAS NOT BEEN 
SCHEDULED, FOLLOWING A COURT VERDICT DECLARING THE SUSPECT, 
TAWFIZ MUHAMMAD FARROUKH, NOT GUILTY OF MURDER FOR HIS ROLE 
IN THE KILLINGS. 
 
E) SENIOR GOL OFFICIALS HAVE REPEATEDLY DENOUNCED AND 
CONDEMNED THE SEPTEMBER 11 AND OTHER TERRORIST ATTACKS. 
PRIME MINISTER HARIRI ISSUED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE 
MURDER OF AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY IN SIDON. 
 
LEBANESE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE 
PAST ACTS OF TERRORISM.  ALTHOUGH NO ARRESTS HAVE YET BEEN 
MADE REGARDING RECENT BOMBINGS AGAINST AMERICAN FAST-FOOD 
RESTAURANTS AND THE MURDER OF AN AMERICAN IN SIDON, LEBANESE 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE PLEDGED THEIR SUPPORT IN 
FINDING THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTS. 
 
F) NONE. 
 
G) THE GOL PROVIDES NO KNOWN MATERIAL OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT 
TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  AT SYRIA'S DIRECTION, HOWEVER, 
IT DOES PROVIDE SAFEHAVENS AND BASES FOR SEVERAL TERRORIST 
GROUPS.  SYRIA HAS GRANTED HIZBALLAH AND PALESTINIAN 
REJECTIONIST GROUPS, INCLUDING PIJ, PFLP-GC, AND HAMAS THE 
RIGHT TO MAINTAIN BASES AND OFFICES IN VARIOUS AREAS OF 
LEBANON, INCLUDING THE BIQ'A VALLEY, THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS OF 
BEIRUT, AND PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS.  THE GOL IS POWERLESS 
TO TAKE UNILATERAL STEPS TO REMOVE THESE SAFEHAVENS FROM 
LEBANESE TERRITORY. 
 
H) THE GOL HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. 
HOWEVER, GOL OFFICIALS HAVE CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN, PUBLICLY 
AS WELL AS PRIVATELY, THAT HIZBALLAH IS A "RESISTANCE," NOT 
A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. 
 
I) THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 2001 IN THE 
GOL'S ATTITUDE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM. 
THE GOL IN 2002 DEMONSTRATED GREATER EFFORTS TO PURSUE 
FUGITIVE SUNNI EXTREMISTS, INCLUDING SUSPECTS IN HIDING IN 
PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS.  THE GOL HAS NOT ENTERED THE 
CAMPS TO PURSUE SUSPECTS, BUT SUCCESSFULLY PRESSURED 
PALESTINIAN AND ISLAMIC GROUPS TO HAND OVER A SUSPECT WANTED 
FOR KILLING THREE LAF PERSONNEL.  THE LAF ALSO UNDERTOOK AN 
OPERATION TO CONFISCATE WEAPONS FROM AN ANO WEAPONS 
WAREHOUSE ADJACENT TO THE AL-JILAL PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP 
NEAR BAALBEK. 
 
J) THE GOL HAS ACCEPTED AND IMPLEMENTED ALL LISTS PASSED BY 
THE U.S. UNDER E.O. 13224 AND UNSCRS 1267, 1333 AND 1373, 
EXCEPT FOR THE REQUEST TO FREEZE HIZBALLAH ASSETS.  IN 
RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST, THE SIC ASKED FOR EVIDENCE OR 
SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT WOULD WARRANT AN INVESTIGATION 
UNDER LEBANESE LAW. 
 
K) (I) THE U.S. HAS REPEATEDLY ASKED THE GOL TO TURN OVER 
THE LEBANESE TERRORISTS INVOLVED IN THE 1985 HIJACKING OF 
TWA 847 AND IN THE ABDUCTION, TORTURE, AND MURDER OF 
AMERICAN HOSTAGES FROM 1984 TO 1991.  U.S. COURTS HAVE 
BROUGHT INDICTMENTS AGAINST A NUMBER OF THESE HIZBALLAH 
OPERATIVES, SOME OF WHOM REMAIN IN PROMINENT POSITIONS IN 
THE ORGANIZATION TODAY.  THE GOL ARGUES THAT ITS PROVISION 
OF AMNESTY TO LEBANESE INVOLVED IN ACTS OF VIOLENCE DURING 
LEBANON'S CIVIL WAR PREVENTS IT FROM PROSECUTING THESE 
CASES.  WITH REGARD TO THE THREE TWA 847 SUSPECTS, INCLUDING 
IMAD MUGHNIYA, THE GOL MAINTAINS THAT THEY ARE NOT IN 
LEBANON. 
 
(II) THE LAF PROVIDES IMMEDIATE PERIMETER PROTECTION OF THE 
U.S. EMBASSY AND ACCOMPANIES EMBASSY PATROLS OF THE 
SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE ISF PROVIDES PROTECTIVE EOD 
AND INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE EMBASSY.  THE LAF AND ISF 
HAVE RESPONDED FULLY TO OUR REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE. 
 
L)  NOT APPLICABLE.
