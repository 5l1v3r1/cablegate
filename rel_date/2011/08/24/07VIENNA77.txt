SUBJECT: AUSTRIAN RESPONSE: URGING SUPPORT FOR LEBANON AT 
JANUARY 25 PARIS DONORS' CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 2781 
 
Â¶1.  On January 11, Acting Econ/Pol Counselor met with 
Helfried Carl, Deputy Director in the MFA's Near East and 
Africa Division, to encourage high-level Austrian 
participation at the January 25 Paris III conference and to 
urge Austrian financial support for Lebanon.  Carl stressed 
that the GoA shared the USG political and economic objectives 
to stabilize Lebanon's political situation and to support 
economic development.  Carl noted that, with the swearing in 
of a new Austrian Government on January 11, the GoA could now 
decide on its delegation in the coming days.  The Chancellery 
had received French President Chirac's invitation, but Carl 
speculated that either Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik or 
Finance Minister Wilhelm Molterer would represent Austria. 
Carl promised to contact us as soon as the Austrian 
delegation is firm.
