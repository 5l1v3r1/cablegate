(SBU) We deployed REFTEL talking points with MFA Israel and 
Palestinian Affairs Department Head Ali Reza Guney December 
Â¶3.  Guney welcomed the Secretary's explicit reference to the 
"Palestinian 
goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 
lines, with agreed swaps."  He urged the USG to consider 
bolstering Palestinians' confidence in our support for that 
goal by endorsing its realization in a UN resolution.
