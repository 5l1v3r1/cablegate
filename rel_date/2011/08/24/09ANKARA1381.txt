SUBJECT: TURKEY SUPPORTS USG OBJECTIVES FOR AD-HOC LIAISON 
COMMITTEE MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 95980 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 18 we delivered REFTEL objectives to 
Rauf Denktas at MFA's Directorate General for the Middle 
East.  He told us that Turkey supports the U.S. objectives 
and that the Deputy Under Secretary for the Middle East and 
head of the department plan to attend the Ad Hoc Liaison 
Committee meeting September 22.  He explained that Turkey has 
increased its assistance to the Palestinian Authority (PA) a 
great deal in the past two years, including pledging $150 
million in Paris and another $50 million this March. 
According to Denktas, Turkish NGOs under coordination with 
the PM have raised an additional $50 million for the PA. 
Turkey would like its financial assistance to be used in 
specific projects so that it can better track where and how 
the money is being spent.  Turkey sees PM Fayyad's two-year 
plan as completely in step with the work that it is doing 
with the Palestinians and Turkey also supports a timeline. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We also delivered REFTEL points to Evren Dilekli, 
Department Head for International Finance at the Turkish 
Treasury Ministry.  Dilekli said Treasury has a subsidiary 
role to MFA on this issue.  Given the upcoming G-20 and 
IMF/World Bank meetings in the next two weeks, he thought it 
extremely unlikely that the GOT could reach an interagency 
position on additional assistance to the PA before the 
September 22 meeting.  We told Dilekli that the September 22 
meeting would be at a working level and that there would 
likely be a follow-on ministerial meeting.
