SUBJECT: SPLM HOSTS ALL PARTIES POLITICAL CONFERENCE: SUPPORT FOR 
CPA, RESOLUTION OF DARFUR AND CRITICISM OF NCP 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  After numerous delays and a closed session of the 
party delegates to discuss procedural issues on September 26, the 
opening session of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) 
hosted All Parties Political Conference commenced on September 27, 
with the conspicuous absence of the National Congress Party (NCP). 
Leaders of the key Sudanese political parties finally agreed that 
the conference should focus on implementation of peace agreements, 
national reconciliation, global economic crisis, democratic 
transformation and foreign relations.  During the opening session, 
leaders criticized the NCP for not attending the conference, called 
on the SPLM, NCP and all Sudanese parties to ensure Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement (CPA) implementation and focused on the need to 
resolve the crisis in Darfur.  Delegates will attend separate 
breakout sessions on September 28 and the conference will close on 
September 29.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Delays and more delays... 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) After numerous postponements over the past few months, the 
diplomatic community again received notice that the SPLM-hosted All 
Political Parties Conference was planned for Sept 26-29.  SPLM 
Deputy Secretary General Anne Itto told us that much of the delay 
from earlier dates to the current ones were because the SPLM wanted 
to have the NCP in attendance as well as Democratic Unionist Party 
(DUP) Leader Al-Mirghani.  In the end, the NCP did not attend and 
while the DUP did attend, Al-Mirghani did not.  Agreement on 
procedural issues further delayed the conference from commencing on 
Sept 26, when delegates held an internal meeting late into the night 
to agree on agenda, observers and procedures for reaching the final 
communiqu.  The delegates reportedly stated they did not come to 
Juba in order to "rubber-stamp" an "SPLM initiative." 
 
---------------------------- 
"CPA Classic" or "CPA Plus"? 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) In opening remarks, all delegates affirmed their commitment 
to the CPA and called for its full implementation.  However, there 
were divergences of opinion on whether the CPA should be implemented 
strictly or modified to create a "CPA plus," to allow Sudanese to 
choose confederation as a "third option" in addition to the 
CPA-enshrined choices of unity or separation. 
 
¶4. (U) The Umma National party and Umma-Reform and Renewal, 
represented by Saddiq el Mahdi and Mubarak-al-Fadil respectively, 
were the lead proponents of the confederation option, while the 
SPLM, United Democratic Forum (UDF) and others stressed that the CPA 
was not open for re-negotiation. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Impediments to CPA  - Can Elections Be Held? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Across the political spectrum, all party representatives 
cited significant obstacles to full CPA implementation, and in 
particular to the holding of elections in April 2010.  The 
oft-discussed impediments included the disputed census results; the 
need to reform or repeal a number of laws which constrain democratic 
activities; and the Darfur crisis. 
 
¶6.   (U) Delegates blamed the NCP for placing the elections "in 
jeopardy," and several participants stated that resolution of the 
above cited impediments should be a pre-condition for elections. 
However, few offered an alternative plan of action in the event 
these obstacles were not overcome.  Hassan-Al-Turabi argued that the 
NCP would "yield under pressure" and advocated an elections boycott 
if "Darfur is not resolved."  At the other end of the spectrum, Hizb 
el Haq called for all parties to support the SPLM in the elections 
and for Salva Kiir to head the ticket.  (Note: Other than the Hizb 
el Haq proposal, all other delegates studiously avoided the 
appearance of forming an elections alliance against the NCP. 
Delegates hewed to the talking point that the conference was meant 
to foster national dialogue, not electioneering.  End Note.) 
 
--------------------------- 
Resolution of Darfur Crisis 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) While CPA implementation remained the key focus of the 
conference, all leaders expressed their concerns over the crisis in 
Darfur and the need for immediate resolution. The Umma party 
proffered the most prescriptive proposals for resolving the Darfur 
crisis, and averred, diplomatically, that as a member of the 
 
KHARTOUM 00001097  002 OF 002 
 
 
presidency General Salva Kiir could exercise greater leverage. 
Earlier, the SPLM highlighted its efforts to unify the rebel groups 
under a common position. All parties underscored that elections 
which resulted in the disenfranchisement of  millions of Darfuris 
would be a recipe for continued conflict. 
 
¶8.  (U) Next Steps: The All Political Parties Conference is set to 
conclude on September 29.  We understand that participants hope to 
agree to a Declaration of Principles leading up to the 2010 
elections and 2011 referendum at the conference's conclusion.  It is 
still unclear whether the NCP will organize a follow-on conference 
in Juba as it published earlier.
