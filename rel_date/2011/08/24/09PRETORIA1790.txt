Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) On Wednesday, August 26th, both the African National 
Congress (ANC) and Nelson Mandela's office issued press 
releases mourning the death of Senator Edward Kennedy.  Each 
recognized and expressed gratitude for his role in the 
anti-apartheid movement.  Local press ran wire stories 
concentrating more on the biographical details of his life. 
These public statements highlight values and aspirations that 
our two countries share. End Summary.

Press Releases Highlight Kennedy's Contributions

¶2.  (U) The ANC remembered Senator Kennedy's visit to South 
Africa in 1985, noting that he staged an "illegal protest" 
outside Pollsmoor Prison where Nelson Mandela was 
incarcerated.  They emphasized that Mandela has said he knew 
at the time that Kennedy was at the gate of the prison and 
that this fact gave him and his fellow prisoners strength and 
hope.  The ANC credited Kennedy with using his trip and the 
accompanying press to draw attention to apartheid.  The 
release also acknowledged that it was Kennedy who introduced 
the Anti-Apartheid act in 1985 imposing economic sanctions on 
South Africa when it was passed the following year over 
President Ronald Reagan's veto. 
 
¶3.  (U) Nelson Mandela's office mourned the loss of Kennedy 
as a champion of democracy and civil rights.  In a statement, 
Mandela said, "He made his voice heard in the struggle 
against apartheid at a time when the freedom struggle was not 
widely supported in the West.  We remain grateful for his 
role."

Local Press Focus on Kennedy's Life 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) While The Star ran an article noting Kennedy's 
anti-apartheid efforts and quoted a press release from the 
office of President Jacob Zuma, most other newspapers ran 
international wire service articles that focused on his long 
career and his family tragedies.  The Star article quoted a 
Zuma statement calling Kennedy a comrade and friend in the 
fight for liberation.  The Pretoria News and the Sowetan 
articles instead summarized the late senator's life and 
career, making no mention of his role in the fight to end 
apartheid.

¶5.  (U) In a relationship sometimes complicated by mild 
mistrust and grudges held over from the Cold War era, these 
public acknowledgments of Kennedy's anti-apartheid efforts 
serve to underscore values and aspirations that the U.S and 
South Africa have in common.  Post issued a press release and 
posted it to the mission's web page, Facebook and Twitter 
pages.  To date, post has received approximately 40 
condolences celebrating Kennedy's life and remembering his 
help in the struggle to end apartheid. End comment.
