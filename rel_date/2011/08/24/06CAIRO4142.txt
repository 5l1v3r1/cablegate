¶1.  (U) Emirati telecommunications corporation Etisalat, in 
partnership with the Egyptian Post Office, the Commercial 
International Bank of Egypt (CIB), and the National Bank of 
Egypt, on July 4 won the auction for Egypt's third mobile 
license, pledging to pay a whopping LE 16.7 billion (USD 2.91 
billion) and six percent of revenues to the GOE for the next 
three years (reftels). 
 
¶2.  (U) The mood among those touched by the auction - GOE and 
private sector - was generally celebratory.  The GOE touted 
the bid price as evidence of confidence in the sector and the 
economy, and most onlookers agreed that the auction was 
fairly transparent.  Minister of Finance Yusuf Boutros-Ghali 
stated that the proceeds will assist the GOE to offset the 
budget deficit, raise economic performance, and increase 
social services.  A private sector industry contact told 
Econoff that his company would benefit from the expected 
increase in competition and expansion of market penetration, 
while a senior Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology (MCIT) official quipped that he hoped to propose 
the Fourth of July as a new Egyptian holiday.  The Cairo and 
Alexandria Stock Exchanges (CASE) also reacted positively 
overall, with the CASE30 Index climbing by 2.6 percent.  Not 
only did shares of winning consortium partner CIB increased 
by 7.6 percent, but even shares in current mobile providers 
MobiNil and Vodafone witnessed sizeable increases, 20 percent 
and 9.6 percent, respectively. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: Not all the news was good, however.  As 
the same MCIT official admitted to Econoff, the future of 
Telecom Egypt (TE) stock prices would continue to be a 
problem (reftels).  TE prices only declined by 2.8 percent on 
the day to LE 11.67/share, with some contacts suggesting that 
the market had already absorbed the possibility that TE would 
not win the auction.  Although TE might try to increase its 
share of Vodafone or make a deal with the new consortium - 
there are rumors that it could become the "virtual operator" 
for the group (what that means precisely remains unclear) - 
it is unlikely that it will recover much ground in the short 
term.  The potential for political fallout remains high over 
the harm to small investors who sank their life savings into 
TE stock when it was over double its current value, and who 
were hoping for success in the auction.  End comment.
