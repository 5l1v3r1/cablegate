¶1. (U) This cable serves as a response to the Department's 
request for information (Ref B) on Zimbabwe's progress 
towards improving its performance in addressing 
anti-trafficking issues.  In response to Zimbabwe's recent 
Tier 3 ranking in the Trafficking in Persons report, Post has 
encouraged the Zimbabwean gvernment to take action as 
described in the Tier 3 Action Plan on legislation, victim 
protection, and public awareness (Ref A). 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Pace Quickening Towards Anti-TIP legislation 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Officials in the Prime Minister's office, the 
Parliament, the Foreign Ministry and the Justice Ministry 
agreed that anti-trafficking legislation is important.  The 
Prime Minister's office has taken up the issue and begun to 
consult with stakeholders with an eye towards drafting a 
comprehensive anti-trafficking bill.  Advisor to the Prime 
Minister Rosie Zigomo, a lawyer by training, is consulting 
with local NGOs that provide assistance to trafficking 
victims and that are researching trafficking in Zimbabwe. 
The local office of the International Organization for 
Migration employs a consultant who has been working with the 
Parliament's legal advisor, Choice Damiso, to establish a 
framework for a new law.  Zigomo told poloff that she and 
Minister of State in the Office of the Prime Minister Gordon 
Moyo had brought the issue and the recent Tier 3 ranking to 
the attention of Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, who agrees 
that anti-trafficking legislation should be on the 
legislative agenda for 2009-2010.  Minister Moyo has agreed 
to spearhead the issue.  He plans on proposing draft 
legislation in Cabinet, which will then forward the issue to 
Parliament.  Moyo has asked Zigomo to review sample 
legislation from other African nations (which Post has 
provided with the assistance of G/TIP) and to prepare 
briefing papers on trafficking in Zimbabwe.  Post is helping 
Zigomo identify local civil society organizations to prepare 
the briefing papers and to serve as sources for consultation. 
 Zigomo told us on August 10 that Minister Moyo plans to 
introduce the topic of anti-trafficking legislation in the 
cabinet meeting held during the week of August 17.  After the 
issue is presented in cabinet, Zigomo told us that PM 
Tsvangirai plans on issuing a public statement against 
trafficking. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We anticipate ZANU-PF members of parliament will 
agree with the push to prioritize anti-TIP legislation. 
Deputy Minister of Justice Jessie Majome told us on July 27 
that Attorney General Johannes Tomana was recently invited to 
South Africa by the South African National Prosecuting 
Authority.  The South Africans used the meeting to encourage 
Zimbabwe to pass anti-trafficking legislation in advance of 
the 2010 World Cup, to be held in South Africa in May and 
June 2010.  According to Majome, Tomana was surprised that 
"even Mozambique" had introduced anti-trafficking 
legislation.  On his return to Zimbabwe, Tomana told Minister 
Qlegislation.  On his return to Zimbabwe, Tomana told Minister 
of Justice Patrick Chinamasa and Majome that Zimbabwe should 
move to introduce such legislation.  In addition, a respected 
South African research organization, Durban-based Human 
Sciences Resource Council (HSRC), recently visited Zimbabwe 
and spoke with poloff on human trafficking in Zimbabwe.  He 
told us that the HSRC had been commissioned by the South 
African Government to research trafficking in Zimbabwe, 
Lesotho, and Swaziland in advance of the World Cup.  This 
regional pressure is likely to be effective towards 
encouraging the Zimbabwean government to introduce and pass 
an anti-trafficking law. 
 
---------------------------- 
Victim Protection Still Weak 
 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post has no evidence of enhanced law enforcement and 
social welfare capacity to meet trafficking victim needs; a 
recent trafficking case (Ref C) confirms this weakness.  In 
this most recent case, the Zimbabwean embassy in Angola 
proved extraordinarily helpful in facilitating the 
repatriation of Zimbabwean trafficking victims. 
Unfortunately, when their case entered the Ministry of Labor 
-- the only appropriate venue to prosecute the trafficking 
perpetrators given the absence of anti-trafficking 
legislation -- the government's response quickly 
deteriorated.  We have shared the details of this ongoing 
case with Zigomo and Magwenzi, who both recognized the need 
for a more holistic approach by the GOZ in providing support 
for trafficking victims.  While the GOZ has not yet addressed 
these shortcomings, the acknowledgment of the need to expand 
support will pave the way for further government action. 
 
--------------------- 
No Media Campaign Yet 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post has recorded no progress on the third element 
in the action plan: an expanded nationwide awareness 
campaign.  Post will continue engagement on this issue.
