SUBJECT: US MARSHALS SERVICE,S SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP 
COMPLETES FIVE- YEAR MISSION IN IRAQ 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  Following the removal of the Saddam 
Hussein regime in Iraq, the United States Marshals Service, 
Special Operations Group (SOG), ensured that Saddam and 
members of the regime remained in custody to stand trial for 
their crimes, worked to provide security for the nation,s 
judges 
and witnesses, and helped train a new generation of Iraqi 
protective services personnel.  With its mission completed, 
on 
September 20, 2009, the remaining SOG personnel in Baghdad 
departed Post. END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) Since March 2004, 114 USMS SOG members have built 
capacity for judicial and courthouse security with funding 
from 
the State Department,s Bureau of International Narcotics and 
Law Enforcement (INL).  SOG provided equipment and 
resources for the protection of the judiciary and managed the 
installation of modern screening and security equipment in 
the 
Iraqi courts.  SOG also developed, managed and contracted 
training for thousands of personal security detail members 
for 
the Iraqi judiciary and the uniformed Facility Protection 
Service 
(FPS) for Iraqi courthouses.  In the early years of the 
mission, 
SOG members conducted interviews and collected evidence 
for high profile cases including cases against Saddam Hussein 
and his regime.  It also ensured the safety of witnesses who 
risked their lives and those of their families to appear and 
testify in these high-profile cases.  These efforts have made 
the Iraqi judiciary safe and more secure, allowing the rule 
of 
law to develop over the six years since Saddam,s removal. 
 
SUPPORT TO THE IRAQI HIGH TRIBUNAL 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶3. (U) SOG also managed construction and renovation of the 
Iraqi High Tribunal (IHT) courthouse, which tries individuals 
from the Saddam Hussein regime for international crimes such 
as genocide and crimes against humanity committed between 
July 17, 1968 and May 1, 2003.  The court began operations on 
October 19, 2005.  The court,s first day began with the 
trial of 
Saddam Hussein and seven other members of his government 
for the killing of 148 civilians in the village of Al Dujayl. 
 Since 
then the IHT has held numerous other trials against regime 
members.  SOG assistance to the court included training for 
the 
security force of the IHT; serving as a Quick Response Force 
during trials conducted at the IHT; protecting and 
transporting 
witnesses; and facilitating the secure transfer of Saddam 
Hussein to the Government of Iraq (GOI) for execution 
following his conviction in the Al Dujayl case. 
 
¶4. (SBU) as part of its assistance to the IHT, SOG also 
created the 
first Witness Protection Program in Iraq.  They created five 
secure facilities to house and protect witnesses during their 
involvement at trial in the International Zone starting in 
the 
fall of 2005 during the Saddam Hussein trial.  At that time, 
a 
pre-existing camp was upgraded and secured to implement the 
initiative.  Several more camps were added during that trial 
to 
house defense counsel.  Planning for pending trials and the 
need to house witnesses not involved with regime crimes led 
to the establishment of several safe site camps.  Over time, 
the 
camps were consolidated into a more efficient model, allowing 
for security and cost savings, as well as a simplified 
turnover. 
SOG also transported witnesses throughout Iraq for production 
during IHT trials.  SOG turned over security responsibilities 
Qduring IHT trials.  SOG turned over security responsibilities 
at 
the IHT to the GOI in September 2008 and the witness camps in 
November 2008. 
 
COURTHOUSE AND JUDICIAL SECURITY EFFORTS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) SOG also oversaw the renovation and administration 
 
of the Al-Hayat Towers, a judicial security complex designed 
to 
safely house and protect members of the Iraqi judiciary and 
their families.  The Al-Hayat is a secure housing complex 
that 
houses over 40 judges and their families.  The complex was 
rehabilitated at the direction of the USMS to house members 
of the Higher Judicial Council (HJC).  These judges preside 
over 
terrorism and other major criminal cases at the Central 
Criminal Court of Iraq (CCC-I).  On September 30, 2008, SOG 
turned over possession of the Al-Hayat Towers to the GOI. 
 
¶6. (U) SOG also managed construction and renovation of the 
CCC-I courthouse building.  The CCC-I is located immediately 
outside the confines of the International Zone in the area 
known as the Red Zone in Baghdad.  The SOG mission was to 
establish the court as an avenue to try cases including 
terrorism, public corruption, and attacks on Coalition 
Forces. 
Security is provided by FPS and Iraqi Police (IP).  SOG 
established the court and trained the assigned FPS in 
courthouse operations. 
 
¶7. (U) SOG reviewed and redesigned plans for four secure 
regional courthouse complexes, positioned in Basra, Hillah, 
and Baghdad (Rusafa and Karkh), to enhance rule of law.  SOG 
personnel advised on construction until the projects were 
completed, staffed by properly trained personnel and running 
smoothly.  The cost of these projects was over $40 million. 
 
¶8. (U) In adddition, SOG performed physical security 
assessments 
on over 30 Iraqi court structures in Baghdad and over 50 
courthouses throughout Iraq.  These assessments provided for 
security upgrades to courthouses that allowed for controlling 
access, both vehicle and foot traffic, help secure 
courthouses 
against bombings, mitigate damage from bombings both to the 
buildings and personnel within.  This additional protection 
helped the judiciary perform their duties and advanced the 
rule of law in Iraq. 
 
¶9. (SBU) COMMENT: During the five years that USMS SOG has 
been part of US federal law enforcement assistance efforts to 
the GOI, the security of the Iraqi judicial system has 
improved 
markedly.  The improved security posture promoted by SOG 
has led to a substantial decrease in the assassination of 
judges 
and judicial personnel as well as overall security incidents 
in 
Iraq.  With a more secure judiciary, Iraq,s legal 
professionals 
have been able to focus on developing the rule of law to 
develop and mature. END COMMENT.
