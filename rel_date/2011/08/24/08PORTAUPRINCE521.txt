¶1. (SBU) Econoff discussed reftel points March 31 with 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs International Organizations 
Director Azad Belfort.  Belfort told Econoff Haiti supports 
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1803 and will do what it can 
to support its implementation.  Belfort appeared generally 
familiar with the Nuclear Suppliers' Group guidelines on dual 
use items but did not believe there was a risk of transfers 
from Haiti of dual use material, equipment or technology to 
Iran restricted under UNSCR 1803. 
 
¶2. (U) Belfort noted the Government of Haiti plans to 
establish a Nuclear Safety Authority (Autorite de Surete 
Nucleaire) which will serve as the GoH's principal nuclear 
monitoring authority.  He added that the International Atomic 
Energy Agency will provide support to the Ordimeter and 
Radioprotection Unit (Unite d'Ordimetrie et de 
Radioprotection) of the Ministry of Health to identify 
radioactive sources in businesses and industries. 
 
¶3. (U) Belfort said these two entities could enhance Haiti's 
ability to comply with international nonproliferation regimes 
as well as maintain health and other safeguards.  Reftel 
nonpaper was left with Belfort.
