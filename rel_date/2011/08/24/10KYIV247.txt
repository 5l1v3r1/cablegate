SUBJECT: UKRAINIAN RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT 
COMMUNICATIONS LINK DEMARCHE 
 
REF: 09 STATE 120541 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Embassy received a letter on 4 February from the 
Verification Directorate of the General Staff of the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces in response to reftel demarche, which 
was delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs December 7, 
¶2009.  The letter confirmed Government of Ukraine interest in 
maintaining the Government to Government Communications Link 
(GGCL) as proposed, and requested a preliminary meeting with 
Embassy to discuss suggestions for a team visit by the U.S. 
side. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Per the Verification Directorate's request, Poloff 
and DTRO officer subsequently met with Colonel Kanonik and 
Colonel Shendyuk of the Verification Directorate on February 
¶8. Kanonik said that Ukraine is definitely interested in 
exploring how the GGCL could be useful going forward, even 
with the expiration of its original mandate.  For example, 
Ukraine would be interested in possible uses under the ABM 
Treaty. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Kanonik said the GoU welcomes a working visit of a 
U.S. team of experts as soon as possible, and noted that the 
two sides should be prepared to discuss their expectations 
for the GGCL's potential uses, as well as the technical 
specifics that would be involved in upgrading and maintaining 
the Ukrainian link. In particular, he noted that the 
Ukrainian line is badly outdated, and that costs of operating 
an upgraded line have already been estimated at roughly USD 
32,000 - 35,000 per year.  This initial meeting would 
establish a basis for how and whether to move forward.  He 
suggested another, final meeting in the autumn in Washington 
to reach formal agreement at a policy level.
