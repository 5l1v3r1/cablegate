¶1. On May 20, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 116,807) ran an editorial entitled, "Chavez and the 
U.S. Weapons Embargo."  Quote: 
 
"Caracas and Washington remain locked in a verbal dispute.... 
Chavez' provocative style irritates the White House....  In a year 
in which Chavez hopes to be reelected, we can expect the Venezuelan 
president to use this confrontation as a card to show Venezuelans he 
has clout and determination." 
 
¶2. On May 21, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 102,000) 
ran an article by journalist Ascanio Cavallo, dean of the journalism 
school of University Adolfo Ibaez entitled, "Chavez' Horizon." 
Quote: 
 
"Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has placed Evo Morales under his 
banner of influence in South America.  To achieve this he went as 
far as disputing Brazil's hegemony....  Chile's political circle has 
treated the Chavez phenomenon lightly.  It has not clearly realized 
that Chavez plans to gain continental hegemony...and has realized 
his security depends on ensuring that his main opponent in the 
region, the United States, has more problems and fewer friends.  To 
this end he has chosen to ignore the principle of 
non-interference...and has intervened in Bolivia, is interfering in 
Peru and Nicaragua, will do the same in Ecuador and will find a way 
to do so in Brazil and Argentina.  And Chile?  Of course, as soon as 
he can.... Venezuela is the first rich opponent that Washington has 
had to face in the region, and one that is willing to use its money 
to buy Argentina's foreign debt, give oil to Cuba, garner sympathy 
in Bolivia's campaign (and now in Peru), finance several political 
groups on the continent...and cooperate with the most marginal 
groups: the landless and homeless....  Chavez expresses much better 
than Castro the discontent with globalization and capitalism...and 
therefore has designed a series of sub-regional agreements to 
sabotage the principal symbol of that order: U.S. free trade 
agreements....  The Chilean Foreign Ministry has chosen to be 
extremely prudent and neutral with occurrences on the 
continent...which means Chile will not have an opinion on the 
eventual deterioration of democracy, freedom of expression, and even 
human rights in those nations.  It is sad...but perhaps realistic, 
because everything indicates that Chile currently has no choice in 
this new scenario.... Whether Chile likes it or not, it influences 
its neighbors. As a net buyer of energy it will affect the price of 
oil and gas, inevitably touching upon the interests of Argentina, 
Bolivia, Peru, and even Venezuela; as an investment exporter it must 
heed judicial assurances for its entrepreneurs; and as a 
preferential trade partner of the United States, the European Union 
and the Asia-Pacific region, sooner or later it must express an 
opinion regarding confidence in (Latin America)."
