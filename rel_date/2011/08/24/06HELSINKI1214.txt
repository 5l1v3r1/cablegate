SUBJECT: DEMARCHE TO EU MEMBERS ON UN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
LEBANON COMMISSION OF INQUIRY - FINNISH RESPONSE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 196226 
 
(SBU) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Middle East 
Office Eija Rotinen and to Human Rights Office Director 
Johanna Suurpaa Dec. 7.  The Finns said that there is 
consensus within the EU that "talking one-sidedly" within 
the Human Rights Council only about Israel is 
"counterproductive and ridiculous."  They predicted that 
the EU's comments on the resolution will not be accepted 
and that the EU block will vote 'no.'
