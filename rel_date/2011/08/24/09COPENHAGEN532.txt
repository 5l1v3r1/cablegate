¶1.  (SBU)  Messages concerning current U.S. positions on the 
Angarsk nuclear fuel bank resolution (reftels A and B), P5 1 
efforts on Iran's nuclear program (reftel C), and desired 
follow-up on IAEA's report on Syrian clandestine nuclear 
activities (reftel D) were directly conveyed by PolOff to 
Henriette Kristensen, Head of Section, Department for 
Security Policy, MFA, on November 23.  Kristensen said that 
Denmark was actively preparing to engage on all three issues 
at the November 26-27 IAEA Board of Governors meeting, and 
was coordinating its positions on the issues with its EU 
partners, implying that Denmark's positions would adhere 
closely to those of the EU.  Although Kristensen declined to 
specifically state what those positions would be, she did say 
discussions within the Ministry indicate "significant 
overlap" with stated U.S. objectives.
