SUBJECT: SPAIN WILL CONTRIBUTE 2 ARMORED VEHICLES TO MFO 
 
¶1.    According to Spanish MFA Deputy Director General for 
the Middle East Alberto Ucelay, Spain has initiated the 
paperwork to transfer two armored vehicles to the MFO.  He 
could not provide a delivery timetable, but said that, "the 
contribution reflected Spain's concern for regional stability 
and recognized the MFO's important work."  Choosing his words 
carefully, Ucelay  noted, " this donation will complete 
Spain's 2007 announcement of additional support to the MFO." 
Although Embassy had been pressing for Spain to contribute a 
larger number of FAVs, Ucelay implied that Spain could not 
consider any additional funding or material transfers at this 
time. 
 
¶2.   The announcement follows persistant advocacy by Embassy 
during the last six months during meetings with Deputy FM 
Leon, MFA Political Advisor Dezcallar and MFA Middle East 
Director General Iranzo.   Embassy will continue its efforts 
to seek increased scope of Spanish contributions to the MFO 
in the year ahead.
