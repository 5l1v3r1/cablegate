SUBJECT: JEM CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEFRA ATTACK AND CONTINUES TO 
HOLD HOSTAGES 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 1664 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On October 28, Abdulaziz Nur Ushar, who claimed to be the 
Deputy Secretary for Political Affairs of the Justice and Equality 
Movement (JEM,) told EconOff that his movement is responsible for 
the October 24 attack on the Defra oil facility where JEM fighters 
allegedly captured five hostages (an Egyptian, Iraqi, and three 
Sudanese drivers.)  Defra is located in oil block 4 of South 
Kordofan state.  Ushar stated that the Egyptian hostage claims to be 
a Canadian citizen.  Ushar promised that JEM was treating the 
hostages well, and claimed that "we did not mean to capture the 
civilians."  He threatened that foreign oil companies must leave the 
area by October 31 or face more attacks from JEM.  He stated that 
JEM will not harm or kill the hostages even if foreign companies 
stay past October 31.  He said JEM is not motivated by money and 
would not accept any ransom for the release of the hostages.  He was 
not willing to disclose the name of the field commander responsible 
for the attack, nor the number of field soldiers involved in it. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Ushar gave a number of reasons for the attack on the 
Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company (GNPOC) facility.  He 
claimed that "China helps the Government of Sudan commit genocide," 
stating that the attack on the GNPOC facility is an attack on China. 
 (Note:  The Chinese National Petroleum Company has the largest 
share in GNPOC.  End Note.)  He also stated that all of the men who 
participated in the attack were men from Kordofan who decided to 
"join the revolution."  He noted that these individuals joined his 
movement because they were frustrated that they had not benefited 
from the oil revenues coming from Kordofan.  He added that when the 
people of Kordofan have tried to peacefully raise this issue before, 
the Sudanese intelligence apparatus countered their protests with 
force.  He cited a protest in Kordofan from June 2007 as one example 
where intelligence operatives killed three protestors from Kordofan. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Ahmed Daoud, who claimed to be an assistant to Khalil 
Ibrahim, the head of the main faction of JEM, also told Emboff on 
October 28 that JEM attacked the Defra facility and currently is 
holding the hostages.  Daoud told EmbOff that foreign oil companies 
have until October 31 to leave the area, adding that JEM will then 
attack oil fields starting on November 1. 
 
4  (SBU)  On October 28, the Vice-President of the Greater Nile 
Petroleum Operating Company, Dr. Yousif Mohamed Ahmed told EconOff 
that his company continues to negotiate for the release of three 
hostages (two contractors of Egyptian and Iraqi nationality, and a 
Sudanese driver) taken at the Defra oilfield on October 24.  He said 
that his company is considering paying $200,000 in ransom for the 
release of the hostages.  He did not share the names of the 
individuals or group holding the hostages when asked who he was 
negotiating with. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Comment:  Although there have been isolated attacks on 
oil fields in the past (reftel), JEM's threat to specifically target 
foreign oil companies in the future appears to be unprecedented.  It 
is part of a larger effort by this aggressive rebel group to expand 
the Darfur conflict into neighboring Kordofan.  Post will continue 
to attempt to contact the Canadian and Egyptian embassies and meet 
officials from the Ministry of Energy and Mining to discuss the GoS 
response to this threat.  End Comment.
