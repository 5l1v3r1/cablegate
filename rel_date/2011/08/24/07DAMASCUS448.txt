¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
-------------------------- 
 
"Secrets of Syria's Power" 
 
-------------------------- 
 
Ahmad Dawwa, a commentator in government-owned      Al-Thawra, wrote 
(5/14):  "Many in the region and beyond thought that the vicious 
 
 
campaign of pressure and threats against Syria, in which some Arab 
forces participated and to which they devoted funds and other means, 
would end with tragic consequences for the country.... 
 
"But Syria stood fast in the face of the storm, and events and 
developments proved that its policy was right and its role was 
pivotal.  Moreover, Syria is being counted on regionally and 
internationally to spare the peoples of the region the repercussions 
of what the advocates of wars and chaos did that jeopardized 
security and stability of the world .... 
 
"The secret of Syria's power lies in the fact that it never 
bargained over any of its rights and never accepted the language of 
orders and pressure. 
 
"Syria's power also lies in its dependence on itself and its 
potentials, which increase day after day through the efforts of its 
sons, despite the surrounding political circumstances, and under the 
leadership of President Asad, who guides, follows up, and encourages 
reform projects on all levels...." 
 
----------------------- 
 
"Arabs and Losing Bets" 
 
----------------------- 
 
Muhi Eddin Mohamed, a commentator in government-owned Tishreen, 
wrote (5/14):  "The political winds in the US, France and the UK do 
not do Arabs any good, even though the new leaders sympathize with 
Arabs.  Arabs must sympathize with each other and must defend their 
interests, rights, wealth and territories if they are really 
concerned about living as dignified people, not as satellites.... 
 
"We have had enough bets on changing leaders and politicians all 
over the world.  So far we have not reaped anything, because of the 
absence of joint Arab action on the political, military and economic 
levels.... In order to confront future challenges, Arabs must learn 
the lesson of Syria's insistence on its rights, its persistence in 
national and pan-Arab principles, and its rejection of bargaining on 
its national and regional security.  Syria has succeeded in 
confronting fierce storms and in foiling US pressure by controlling 
the recklessness of extremists and neoconservatives, even if only 
partially.  Syria has also succeeded in changing world public 
opinion toward Arab causes.  Will Arabs learn from the lessons of 
history...?"
