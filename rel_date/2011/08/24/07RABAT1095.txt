¶1.  Summary: Two recent events highlighted ongoing Moroccan 
government and civil society efforts to curb violence and 
abuse against women and children.  On June 21, 2007 Princess 
Lalla Meryam, the King's sister and Chair of the National 
Observatory for Children's Rights (ONDE), secretary of State 
for Social Solidarity Yasmina Baddou, and representatives of 
UNICEF and UNPF unveiled a new set of guidelines for the care 
of women and children victims of violence. It called for 
enhanced government efforts and new laws protecting women. 
Also on June 21, Anaruz, the national network of violence 
against women centers, presented its 2006 report on 
gender-based violence.  The report noted that three-quarters 
of violent acts against women occur within the family, and 
advocated legislation to enhance the protection of women 
during divorce proceedings as well as enforce the law 
regarding payment of alimony.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  The 250 page guidelines document, prefaced by Princess 
Lalla Meryam,. promotes better medical, psychological and 
social care for women and children victims of violence.  It 
also advocates legislation, strategies and action programs at 
the national level, in addition to Morocco's international 
commitments to human rights, and women and children's rights. 
 The guidelines document defines violence and ill-treatment, 
highlights their harmful impact, and determines the 
modalities and process of care for women and children, the 
process of care, the organizational measures and the 
coordination with other sectors. 
 
¶3. During the event, Anaruz presented it's 2006 report 
regarding gender-based violence.  Created in 2004, Anaruz is 
a network of 39 fighting violence against women centers in 
Morocco.  The centers provide legal services to victims, 
gather data, raise awareness of gender-based violence and 
advocate for policy and legal reforms to protect women and 
reduce violence against them. 
 
¶4. According to the report, marital violence represents 74 
percent of domestic violence in Morocco.  Additional forms of 
violence vary form institutional 8.8 percent, societal 4.4 
percent, and family-related 4.2 percent.  Alimony deprivation 
was reported at 58.4 percent, and physical abuse 30.4 
percent, indicating that these are the primary violations 
perpetrated against women. 
 
¶5.  The report calls for legislation guaranteeing the payment 
of alimony and the safety of women undergoing divorce, and 
recommended an increase in shelters and hotlines for women 
victims of violence. 
 
¶6. Women's shelters, through their activities and data 
gathering, are one of the driving forces in the fight to 
combat violence against women in Morocco.  For example, the 
successful coordination between women's NGO's, various 
government institutions, and security forces, has resulted in 
yearly reports such as those described herein.
