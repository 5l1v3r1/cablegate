In Today's Papers 
 
A Historic Day in Ankara (Milliyet) 
All papers:  The multinational Nabucco project deal, which will 
carry Caspian gas to Europe through Turkey, will be signed today. 
Mainstream Vatan notes, "The Nabucco Pipeline project will increase 
Turkey's strategic importance," and "will end the EU's dependence on 
Russia," for natural gas resources.  Mainstream Hurriyet headlines, 
"A Verdi Blessing of Abundance," and notes, "Nabucco, a project 
named after Verdi's famous opera, will carry natural gas from the 
Caspian Sea region and the Middle East via Turkey to the heart of 
Europe, will be signed in Ankara today."  Hurriyet also reports that 
4.5 billion Euro of investments will be made in Turkey.  Mainstream 
Milliyet reports in, "A Historic Day in Ankara," that "An 
inter-governmental agreement for the construction of a pipeline to 
carry Caspian gas to Europe via Turkey will be signed in Ankara 
today."  In addition, the Milliyet notes, "The project means 5 
billion Euro of investment and 5,000 jobs." Mainstream Sabah reports 
the project will create "serious geo-political gains" for Turkey. 
Sunday's Sabah says the pipeline "will change the future of the 
Middle East and the EU." Islamist-oriented Zaman headlines, "The 
Project of the Century Will Transform Turkey into A Natural Gas 
Bridge," and the paper notes "the project will increase Turkey's 
international influence." Zaman columnist Mehmet Yilmaz, however, 
asks, "Why isn't Iran a part of Nabucco," as "Iran has the second 
largest gas reserves in the world." 
 
Mainstream Sabah says leaders of Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary 
and Austria will sign an intergovernmental agreement in Ankara.  A 
surprising name, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki will also be in 
attendance of the ceremony.  Islamist oriented Zaman notes that the 
ceremony will be hosted by Prime Minister Erdogan.  Anatolian Agency 
(AA) reports that Nabucco is planned to be an alternative route to 
transport gas from Turkey to Austria through Bulgaria, Romania and 
Hungary.  It is also an alternative source to the Russian supply. 
The pipeline will carry natural gas from mainly Azerbaijan's Shah 
Deniz fields, as well as Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Iran. 
Construction of the 3300 km pipeline is scheduled to start in 2011 
and first deliveries are expected in 2014.  Reuters quoted Energy 
Minister Taner Yildiz as saying that Turkey gave up on its request 
to get 15 percent of the natural gas.  Later Minister Yildiz told AA 
that there was no such pledge to Turkey to begin with.  He noted 
that 15 percent meant 4.5 billion cubic units but Turkey had the 
right to use even more than that.  Zaman quotes Energy Minister 
Yildiz as saying that Nabucco project will have positive impact on 
Turkish ties with the EU. 
 
Erdal Saglam commented in mainstream Hurriyet: "There are question 
marks about the future prospects of the Nabucco project.  Even today 
as the intergovernmental agreement is being concluded, there is no 
clarity regarding which countries will provide the gas.  Aside from 
Azerbiajian, there is a talk about potential Russian participation 
which bring a question to one's mind: How can this project can be an 
alternative energy source if Russia becomes a part of it?  Also 
Turkey does not play the energy game very well.  Turkey's desire to 
get gas with a 15 percent discount was not accepted.  Despite the 
Turkish government's earlier ambition to become an important player 
of energy game, Turkey has ended up being only a transit route.  The 
Turkish government did not realize the importance of bipartisan 
nature of energy policy and the strong need for shaping a national 
policy for energy.  Instead of focusing on it, government circles 
are engaged in micro business games to favor their party 
sympathizers.  At the end of the day, Turkey's long-term interests 
suffer due to mismanagement." 
 
PM Erdogan Describes the Incidents in Xinxiang, China as Genocide 
Saturday's mainstream Vatan gives front page coverage to the words 
of PM Erdogan describing the killings of hundreds of ethnic Turk 
Uighurs in China's Xinjiang province as "genocide." Erdogan said "We 
respect China's territorial integrity, but we ask the Chinese 
government to protect the rights of our kin there."  Saturday's

liberal-intellectual Radikal says in contrast to the harsh words of 
Erdogan, the Foreign Ministry issued a milder statement saying that 
"Turkey had no intention to meddle in China's internal affairs." 
Today's Hurriyet reports that FM Davutoglu held a 70 minute phone 
call with his Chinese counterpart Yang to discuss the violence in 
Xinjiang.  Davutoglu expressed Turkish sensitivity about the issue 
and drew attention to growing public reactions in Turkey.  The 
Chinese Minister on his part noted that those responsible for the 
bloodshed will stand trial without taking into account any ethnic 
considerations. 
 
Barbarians at Topkapi Palace (Radikal) 
Members of Alperen Ocaklari (ultranationalist political group) 
protested the concert of the world-famous pianist Idil Biret at 
Topkapi Palace on Saturday.  The group protested the concert in 
front of Topkapi Palace because wine was being served during the 
concert.   The protesters tried to get into the concert hall, but 
they were blocked by the police.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak 
reports that Culture and Tourism Minister Ertugrul Gunay reacted 
strongly to the group's intervention at the concert and said "it is 
a fairly saddening behavior.  An impertinent group disrespected both 
Istanbul and our pianist. We cannot ignore this incident.  Nobody 
will tolerate unreasonable behaviors."
