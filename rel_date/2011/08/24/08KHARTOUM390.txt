¶1. (SBU) On Sunday, March 16, CDA Fernandez met with Retired Maj. 
Gen. Al Fatih Abdoun (and former Governor of Khartoum) in his 
Khartoum home. Known as a flexible and moderate leader, Abdoun 
assisted in creating the military support that brought President Al- 
Bashir to power in his 1989 coup. Abdoun is now a member of the 
Shura (Advisory) council within the National Congress Party, and 
claims influence with Al-Bashir and the upper cadre of Sudanese 
leaders. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During the 90-minute meeting, Abdoun repeatedly brought up 
the subject of improved relations with the United States. He said 
any agreement would require a balance of Sudanese and American 
demands, but also acknowledged that the time frame for any agreement 
was running short. Abdoun described Sudan's leadership as 
"terrified" of changes a new administration might bring in 
U.S.-Sudanese relations, as anything signed today may be reversed in 
¶2009. Abdoun claimed that Sudan will accept any measures required by 
the U.S., provided they preserve Sudan's sovereignty and religion. 
CDA countered that the U.S. has no interest in interfering with 
religion in Sudan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Abdoun hewed very closely to the National Congress Party's 
public line.  Darfur rebel Abdul Wahid Nur is "no longer Sudanese" 
but the puppet of foreign powers, including Israel. Rebels in Darfur 
are "terrorists" and their actions anywhere else would be condemned 
by the U.S. Sudan's human rights record is better than that of most 
of its neighbors and most regimes in the Arab world (the majority of 
which are allies of the US). IDPs in Darfur have nothing to complain 
about. The NCP is the best government in Sudanese history (this may 
be true but there is not much competition) and has provided 
unusually good government to the Sudanese people. Sudan is 
categorically not helping Chadian rebels at all in their efforts to 
overthrow President Deby. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Retired Maj. Gen. Abdoun offered insight into the mindset 
of Sudan's old guard, expressing nostalgia for a mythic past 
positive of U.S.-Sudan relations while expressing an impossibly rosy 
view of Sudan's actions and history. Yet while Abdoun has pledged to 
speak to current NCP leaders, including the president, his influence 
is most likely quite limited. While Abdoun, not surprisingly, 
refused to express any criticism of a regime he helped create, he 
did admit that Sudan has done a terrible job of presenting its views 
and reality to the outside world, "a plan was presented to them, but 
they didn't move on it."
