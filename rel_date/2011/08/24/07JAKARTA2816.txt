SUBJECT: INDONESIA 2008 MINI COUNTRY OPERATIONAL PLAN FOR 
HIV/AIDS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On behalf of the Mission Team on HIV/AIDS, I am 
pleased to present the Indonesia 2008 Mini Country 
Operational Plan (COP) in support of the PresidentQs 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  This submission 
represents the combined efforts of the United States 
Department of State, the United States Agency for 
International Development and the Department of Defense Q a 
truly collaborative process of which we are proud. 
 
--------------------------- 
HIV Landscape in Indonesia 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The HIV landscape in Indonesia is undergoing 
fundamental transitions.  First, 2007 marks the beginning 
of a new and integrated national strategy. It is reliant on 
collaboration between the donor community and the 
Government of Indonesia (GOI). A shift in approach or 
commitment on the part of any one partner will have an 
impact on the entire plan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Second, recent data clearly demonstrate the growth 
of a generalized epidemic specific to the province of Papua 
that is very different from the concentrated epidemic 
within Most-At-Risk-Populations (MARP) occurring across the 
rest of the county.  Third, The Global Fund Country 
Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) is in the process of 
addressing irregularities which have resulted in a six 
month restriction period and about which the Global Fund 
secretariat still has outstanding queries. This problem has 
 
SIPDIS 
resulted in significant program implementation delays over 
the last six months and may affect the future landscape of 
HIV/AIDS programming in Indonesia. 
 
-------------- 
FY08 Mini-COP 
-------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The USG is committed to the GOIQs HIV/AIDS 
planning and funding process which includes both an 
integrated national program strategy and a costed action 
plan.  The USG Q through PEPFAR Q is an engaged and vital 
partner with the GOI, as well as with AusAid, the Global 
Fund, DFID, KfW and the UN Agencies.  With our resources, 
we have developed a program that leverages other donor 
assistance to best complement and fill existing gaps. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Embassy Jakarta has structured its FY08 Mini-COP 
to remain responsive to the GOI national strategic plan and 
to make best use of our resources to fill program gaps. 
There is far more we could and would like to do in 
Indonesia to address the HIV epidemic, including scaling-up 
services among MARPs, and overall systems- strengthening to 
facilitate better service delivery in prevention, care and 
treatment services - especially in Papua.  However, we are 
constrained by the reduction of our PEPFAR resources since 
FY06 from $10 million to $8 million. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In addition to your review of our submission, I 
urge O/GAC to enter into discussions with our in-country 
HIV/AIDS team to explore restoring funding levels to $10 
million or more, thus enabling increased programming in 
Papua. 
 
¶7. (SBU) We look forward to receiving your comments and 
your approval of the Mini-COP.
