SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050067028 
 
REF: BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 2006 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050067028 for the export 
of an automatic direction finder (ADF) receiver to Indonesia. 
 Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 
30 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will 
affect pending and future applications involving parties to 
this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  unfamiliar foreign consignee and 
foreign intermediate consignee.  Both PM/DTCC and the 
Department of Defense's Defense Technology Security Agency 
have been unable to verify the existence of either foreign 
consignee PT Anjelika Surya Jaya or foreign intermediate 
consignee Horizon International (S) Pte Ltd.  Neither company 
has appeared on any previous export license applications. 
Post should make appropriate inquiries to verify the bona 
fides of PT Anjelika Surya Jaya and to confirm the legitimacy 
of the proposed transaction. The following questions are 
provided as suggested guidance: 
 
For the Indonesia MOD: 
 
--Are you familiar with PT Anjelika Surya Jaya? 
 
--Did you order from PT Anjelika Surya Jaya the item listed 
on this application? 
 
--Who will install the ADF in the LRU avionic system in an 
Indonesian MOD's F-27 aircraft? 
 
--Is PT Anjelika Surya Jaya an official supplier/contractor 
for the Indonesia MOD?  Does the Indonesia MOD have any other 
contracts with the company? 
 
For PT Anjelika Surya Jaya: 
 
--Does the company have proper supporting documentation, 
including purchase orders from the Indonesia MOD or foreign 
consignee PT Anjelika Surya Jaya, for this proposed 
transaction? 
 
--Why is the item being shipped from the U.S. to Indonesia 
via Singapore? 
 
--What relationship, if any, does the company have with 
Singaporean intermediate consignee Horizon International (S) 
Pte Ltd? 
 
--Who will install the ADF receiver in the LRU avionic system 
in an Indonesian MOD's F-27 aircraft? 
 
--If PT Anjelika Surya Jaya will be handling or storing the 
ADF receiver, does it have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
United States Munitions List (USML) items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what types of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--Does the company have a regular business relationship for 
procuring defense articles on behalf of the Indonesian MOD? 
What types of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers 
and re-exports? 
 
¶4. Department requests that post conduct a site visit to the 
company in order to provide Department with an assessment of 
its business operations and on-site security.  If a site 
visit is not possible, please inform PM/DTCC case officer. 
Finally, post is asked to assess whether the company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  End action.
