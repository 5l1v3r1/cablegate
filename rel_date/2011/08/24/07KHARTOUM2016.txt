SUBJECT: NCP STOOGE BONA MALWAL: SPLM IS UNDERMINING THE CASE FOR 
SOUTHERN SEPARATATION 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Southern turncoat and longtime supporter of an 
independent southern state, GNU Presidential advisor and National 
Congress Party (NCP) member Bona Malwal organized a rally of the 
Southern Sudan Democratic Forum to criticize the recent actions of 
the SPLM.  He alleged SPLM financial misconduct over oil revenues, 
inability to deliver security and services to the south, and accused 
the SPLM of stifling dissent and democracy.  He warned that the 
SPLM's poor record on delivering services might cause voters in 2009 
to vote against separation and vote for unity. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In an hour-long speech before an estimated audience of 200 
plus Southern Sudan Democratic Forum (SSDF) supporters on December 
12, Presidential advisor and long- time John Garang opponent Bona 
Malwal criticized the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movement (SPLM) on 
a number of issues. Reading from a prepared text entitled "The 
Future of Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) under the Current 
Political Crisis," Malwal, often seen as the "Benedict Arnold of 
South Sudan" charged that the SPLM: 
 
-neglected its responsibilities under the CPA by suspending its 
participation in the Government of National Unity and urged the SPLM 
to implement the CPA without further boycotts; 
 
-acted contrary to Sudanese national interests by seeking to 
internationalize the NCP-SPLM impasse, in which these outside 
"friends" would likely use such an opportunity for their own 
interests; 
 
-exaggerated the impasse over the Abyei Protocol by threatening to 
go to war over the issue; 
 
-advertised southern incompetence by nominating only Northern 
Sudanese to replace SPLM member and Foreign Minister Lam Akol 
(Malwal also vigorously defended Lam Akol's performance as Foreign 
Minister); 
 
-falsely claimed that is was not receiving its full share of oil 
revenues; 
 
-failed to deliver promised services and security to the people of 
the South with those oil revenues; 
 
-favored SPLM party members over those of other political parties, 
and muzzled dissent from other parties; 
 
-refused to appoint other-party members to Government of Southern 
Sudan (GOSS) government offices (unlike the NCP, which has offered 
some of its share of positions to the DUP); 
 
-stifled democracy and free speech and warned that there can be no 
free elections in 2009 "while the SPLM is in charge." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Malwal said that unless the performance of the GOSS 
improves drastically, "many Southern Sudanese are likely to ask 
themselves whether to vote for an independent South Sudan that may 
be worse than what they have endured under the North."  Malwal 
warned that the SPLM's poor record on delivering services might 
cause southerners to vote for unity in the 2011 referendum.  At the 
same time, he urged the SPLM to make unity attractive to the people 
of southern Sudan. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: It comes as no surprise that Malwal would take 
advantage of the recent NCP-SPLM political impasse to sling some mud 
at the SPLM.  Allegations of GoSS corruption and lack of political 
openness in the South are well-founded and the NCP seeks every 
opportunity to have southern politicians on its payroll point this 
out (without ever talking about NCP corruption and pressure on 
political opposition and civil society in the North, of course). 
Although Malwal's own views on separation differ from the NCP party 
line supporting unity, it is highly likely that the NCP supported 
Malwal in organizing the event, given the NCP's stranglehold on 
political activity.  The NCP can only gain from pointing out the 
SPLM mismanagement, especially if it supports an argument for unity.
