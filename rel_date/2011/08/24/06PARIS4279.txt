START MEMO POST-OBJ: 
From 1996 through March 2006, Pia IMBS (BOYLE) served as director of 
the Institut d'Administration des Entreprises (IAE)--Business 
Administration Institute, a component of the Robert Schuman 
University, that trains business managers (both professionals and 
students).  Like many other French professionals now, Ms. IMBS 
(BOYLE) has found that creating links between universities and 
business helps qualified students find employment while at the same 
time updating business practices for employers too busy to resume 
their own studies.  She therefore instituted a series of "PHARE" 
("lighthouse") lectures to develop a network between business 
leaders and university faculty and students.  The PHARE network is 
now well established at the regional level, and Ms. IMBS (BOYLE) is 
trying to expand it to the international level.  She would also like 
to advance this goal through the Strasbourg sister-city program. 
Pia IMBS (BOYLE) is Vice President of PHARE and still assistant 
professor at IAE.  She resigned from her position as director in 
order to be more available for a new assignment at the Regional 
Council, where she is the leader of a project on the evolution of 
professional teaching at the university level. 
Strasbourg and Boston have been sister-cities for over 40 years, but 
most of the exchanges were limited to the cultural and educational 
fields.  Both cities seek to develop more exchanges in business and 
economics.  The opportunity of a VolVis Program for one day in 
Boston for Pia IMBS (BOYLE) would greatly contribute to this aim. 
It would also be a good investment for the USG, within the lines of 
MPP priorities because it would reinforce Franco-American 
friendship, mutual understanding, and shared values through 
collaboration with an important French educational institution. 
Upon her return, Pia IMBS (BOYLE) hopes to bring a new impetus to 
the Boston-Strasbourg sister-city relationship as well as contribute 
to developing new exchanges with the United States at the university 
level and throughout the Alsace region.
