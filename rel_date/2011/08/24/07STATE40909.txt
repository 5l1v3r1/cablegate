BACKGROUND/NONPAPER 
------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Begin text of background/nonpaper: 
 
The U.S. would like to inform your government that on 
Friday, March 30, 2007, the U.S. Department of State is 
designating Iran's Defense Industries Organization 
pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382 ("Blocking 
Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and 
Their Supporters"), an authority aimed at freezing the 
assets of proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and 
their supporters and at prohibiting transactions and trade 
between those designated entities and banks in U.S. 
jurisdiction. 
 
The following information will be added to The Department 
of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) 
list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons 
("SDN list") and published in the Federal Register 
pursuant to Executive Order 13382. 
 
-- DEFENSE INDUSTRIES ORGANIZATION (a.k.a. DEFENCE INDUSTRIES 
ORGANISATION; a.k.a DIO; a.k.a. SASEMAN SANAJE DEFA; a.k.a. 
SAZEMANE SANAYE DEFA; a.k.a. "SASADJA", P.O. Box 19585-777, 
Pasdaran Street, Entrance of Babaie Highway, Permanent Expo of 
Defence Industries Organization, Tehran, Iran [NPWMD] 
 
In addition to being listed in the Annex of UNSCR 1737, 
DIO was sanctioned previously by the United States for 
WMD- or missile-related activities under the Iran and 
Syria Nonproliferation Act (ISNA), the Arms Export Control 
Act, and the Export Administration Act. 
 
DIO has also been identified by the IAEA as involved in 
centrifuge component production for Iran's nuclear 
program.  A June 2004 report from the Director General of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Iran's 
implementation of IAEA resolutions noted that Iranian 
authorities acknowledged, during the course of IAEA 
verification activities during 2004, that composite rotors 
for use in P-2 centrifuges had been fabricated in a 
workshop situated on a DIO site. 
 
This action helps implement the legal obligation set forth 
in UNSCR 1737 for countries to freeze the assets of 
entities and individuals named in the Annex of the 
resolution, thereby undermining the organization's ability 
to support Iranian proliferation activities. 
 
We urge your government to investigate financial 
relationships and transactions in which designated Iranian 
proliferation entities have an interest.  Where it is 
suspected that these relationships and transactions may be 
facilitating Iran's proliferation activities, we urge you 
to cease dealings with the entities in question. 
 
We look forward to working with you on this and other 
related security matters and are prepared to provide 
additional assistance as appropriate.
