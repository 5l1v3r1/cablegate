[BEGIN TEXT] 
 
FROM: 
 
Mr. Didier Ratsiraka 
Former President of the Republic of Madagascar 
 
TO: 
 
H.E. Mrs. Hillary R. Clinton 
Secretary of State 
Washington D.C. 
United States of America 
 
Paris, December 12, 2009 
 
Your Excellency, Madam Secretary, 
 
As you may be aware, it was during my tenure as President of the 
Republic of Madagascar, from 1997 to 2002, that Madagascar had the 
honor of entering the African Growth & Opportunity Act (AGOA) 
program, initially known as the Africa Bill, enacted by President 
Clinton.  I feel like the father of Madagascar's access to this 
critically important program and that is the reason why I take the 
liberty to write to you on this matter on behalf of the Malagasy 
people. 
 
To date, the AGOA has been a significant driver of economic 
development and a vital source of much-needed employment for 
hundreds of thousands of my fellow countrymen. 
 
That is why I am pained to learn that a decision to suspend 
Madagascar as an AGOA beneficiary could be taken as early as 
December 15.  The effects of the global crisis and the current 
political instability in our nation have already been devastating to 
our country.  The impact of a decision to remove Madagascar from the 
AGOA program would put 300,000 jobs in jeopardy and could 
potentially lead to further social and economic hardship for our 
people. 
 
Your Excellency, Madam Secretary, 
 
I can assure you that there are a number of political leaders, 
myself included, who are committed to democracy and who are working 
diligently to address the political challenges that have delayed the 
establishment of our transitional government and the associated 
institutions that will be put in place in preparation for a free, 
fair and democratic national election.  It is our goal that these 
challenges will be resolved within the next 30 days.  That is why I 
am writing to you to kindly request that any decision regarding 
Madagascar's AGOA status be postponed for at least 30 days. 
 
Our efforts to put a transitional government in place are in 
accordance with the agreements between the major political parties 
that were signed in Maputo and Addis Ababa.  Under those agreements, 
we will establish a government committed to getting the national 
economy moving once again and to improving the quality of life of 
our 20 million people.  We endeavor that it will also be a 
government committed to democratic principles. 
 
The AGOA program is vitally important to Madagascar and it is a 
privilege that we will not squander.  It plays a major role in our 
economy and we are committed to honoring the guidelines under which 
it is granted. 
 
I would like you to be so good as to accept, Your Excellency Madam 
Secretary, along with my appreciation and gratitude to you and the 
people of the United States of America, the assurance of my highest 
and faithful consideration.
