PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 12905 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel points in coordination with the 
EC's Economic Counselor in Turkey, Ulrike Hauer.  Turkish 
Foreign Trade Undersecretariat Deputy Director General for 
Multilateral Agreements, Hasan Yalcin, told us that Turkey 
supports the ideas presented in the joint proposal "in 
principle", but it has too many concerns about some of the 
specifics to commit at this time to cosponsoring it. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Turkey's general concerns relate to the proposal's 
potential to ease market access for Turkey's major textile 
competitors, such as China.  Its specific concerns relate to 
the language that requires countries to consult with 
non-governmental parties such as the producers and exporters. 
 Turkey is also concerned about paragraph 2 relating to the 
TBT agreement, which Yalcin characterized as too broad and 
giving too much strength to the original TBT agreement. 
Finally, Turkey objects to the notification requirements and 
time limits specified in paragraph 5, which Yalcin 
characterized as "impossible". 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  While not yet ready to cosponsor, we got 
the impression that Turkey's representatives at the WTO are 
willing to discuss their concerns with EC and U.S. 
representatives and could be persuaded.  End comment.
