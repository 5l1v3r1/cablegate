SUBJECT:  South Sudan: Early Rains Affect Development 
Plans 
 
 
¶1.  The rainy season in Central Equatoria began in early 
March, six weeks earlier than expected, altering a 
variety of development and humanitarian assistance plans. 
It has also raised fears that the acute watery diarrhea 
outbreak, largely contained in Juba and the rest of 
Equatoria, may again spread out of control. 
 
¶2.  Problems that have already started to materialize due 
to the early rains: 
 
-- Returns are now more difficult for refugees and IDPs. 
Many are now even more anxious to get back to begin 
cultivating crops. 
 
-- Travel along the important Juba-Yei trade route is 
difficult.  As the rainy season continues, many of the 
other roads in Equatoria will be closed for extended 
periods. 
 
-- SPLA soldiers, housed in tents next to the John Garang 
Memorial and at the outskirts of town, are amplifying 
their demands to be moved into the barracks with the SAF. 
 
-- A variety of construction projects, which were working 
feverishly to be finished before the expected start of 
the rainy season in late April or early May, are now 
facing difficulties.  This includes road repairs in and 
around Juba, and upgrades and expansions at camps housing 
international organizations, including renovations at the 
U.S. Consulate General compound. 
 
-- The Lologo IDP camp outside of Juba was not designed 
for the rainy season.  Built largely as a transit station 
for returnees to Bor, it is already overcrowded due to 
delays resulting from the acute watery diarrhea outbreak. 
 
-- The wet conditions threaten the already tenuous 
control over the acute watery diarrhea outbreak in Juba 
other Equatorian towns as heavy rains combine with on-the- 
ground defecation and the presence of the acute watery 
diarrhea bacteria.
