¶1. (SBU) Ambassador delivered reftel demarche June 9 to 
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr. Mohammad Abdul 
Ghaffar, stressing our desire to delay a vote on the G-4 
proposal.  Abdul Ghaffar said he agreed with our position, 
saying that Bahrain did not believe there was a consensus now 
and that it would be very difficult to move forward on this 
issue without consensus. 
 
¶2. (SBU) DCM followed up with MFA Assistant Undersecretary 
Shaikh Abdul Aziz on July 11.  Abdul Aziz said that Bahrain's 
position tracks with ours.  Bahrain believes that we should 
focus on overall reform of the UN as a first step.  He said 
that he had told the German and Japanese Ambassadors that 
Bahrain does not want to make commitments on individual 
countries at this time, preferring to wait until the details 
of Security Council reform are worked out.
