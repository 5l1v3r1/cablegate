11 Incursions in Jenin 
Area A from 18-22 December 
-------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The IDF conducted 11 separate raids and patrols in 
Area A in Jenin Governorate from December 18-22, searching 
five houses and detaining two Palestinians, according to PA 
National Security Forces (NSF) and District Coordinating 
Office (DCO) contacts.  The IDF operated in central Jenin 
twice December 19-20, and in the Area A towns of al-Jarba, 
Kafr Ra'i, Qabatiya, Araqa, Yabad and Kufrayt, including four 
daylight raids, according to Palestinian security contacts. 
The IDF also conducted raids in the Area A towns of Kafr Qud, 
Hashimiya and Araqa December 21-22, and set up flying 
checkpoints inside Area A between villages. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to NSF and Palestinian Monitoring Group 
(PMG) staff, in addition to increased Jenin-area incursions, 
the IDF has stepped up placement of flying checkpoints in 
Areas B/C between Jenin Governorate towns.  PA security 
contacts complained to ConGenOffs that these checkpoints 
obstruct movement of people and goods and complicate PA 
security responses to Area A/B villages from Jenin.
