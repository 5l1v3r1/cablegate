¶1. (U) In an overture aimed at warming the bilateral 
relationship, Kuwait's "Al Kuwait Kaifan" soccer club 
traveled to Erbil, Iraq, for a September 30 tournament game, 
the first time a Kuwaiti team has traveled to Iraq in two 
decades.  Accompanying the team were prominent Kuwaiti MPs 
Marzouq Al-Ghanem and Walid Al-Tabtabaie, who delivered a 
letter of friendship to KRG President Barzani from Kuwaiti 
Parliament Speaker Jassem Al-Khorafi (Note: Al-Ghanem is the 
club chairman and Al-Tabtabaie is on the club board. End 
note.)  Al-Ghanem, who has used his prominence in parliament 
to argue for strong ties with Iraq (Ref A), told the Iraqi 
press that he felt sports cooperation was a key "cementing" 
factor in the bilateral relationship (for Al-Ghanem bio 
notes, see Ref B). 
 
¶2. (U) Al Kuwait Kaifan is the first team worldwide to brave 
Iraq-hosted matches since the Asian Football Confederation 
deemed the country insufficiently safe to host international 
play in 2003.  Earlier in the tournament, the Lebanese and 
Omani soccer clubs deferred travel to Iraq for their matches 
with the Erbil team, obligating the Erbil players to host 
their "home" games in Jordan. 
 
¶3. (U) At the sold-out match, Iraqi fans held up a large 
banner reading "We welcome Al-Kuwait sports club to the 
Kurdistan region.  We do not care if we win or lose -- the 
ultimate aim is our friendship."  The Kuwaiti team won 1-0.
