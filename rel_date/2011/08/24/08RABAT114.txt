Arab Maghreb Union 
Rabat 
February 1, 2008 
 
His Excellency R. Nicholas Burns 
Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs 
State Department 
Washington, D.C. 
 
Dear Mr. Secretary, 
 
This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 22, 
¶2008.  I was greatly pleased to read the written U.S. keen interest 
in supporting the regional efforts for the Maghreb economic 
integration process, as you made it very clear in our meeting in New 
York on September 9th last year. 
 
Considering the Arab Maghreb Union's commitment to fully support 
initiatives that can contribute to regional security, I am pleased 
to meet Ambassador Dailey, the Special Coordinator for Counter 
Terrorism on February 8, 2008 in Rabat. 
 
I remain confident that this meeting will enable us to share ideas 
on current challenges facing the Maghreb region such as economic 
growth, education, emerging security threats, illegal migration, 
which can only be solved, if not contained by global concerted 
action with a multidimensional approach. 
 
It will also give us the opportunity to consider ways and means to 
enhance and further strengthen the relations between the United 
States and the countries of the Arab Maghreb Union, in order to 
contribute to achieving a more secure, peaceful and developed 
region. 
 
I am looking forward to continue our respective efforts to get 
U.S.-Maghrebian dialogue started and structured. 
 
While thanking you for your contribution in moving this process 
forward, I hope we'll be able to deepen our dialogue during future 
AMU ministers meetings with U.S. officials on a regular basis. 
 
Sincerely, 
/S/ 
Habib Benyahia 
Secretary General
