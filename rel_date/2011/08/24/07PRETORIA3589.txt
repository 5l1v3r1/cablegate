     ¶B. DOE SCOTT - YOUNG E-MAIL DRAFT POINTS ON R&D 
        AGREEMENT 
     ¶C. PRETORIA 3447 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Minerals/Energy Officer delivered Ref A 
message that outstanding issues had been resolved allowing 
South Africa to move forward on implementing the program for 
the return of U.S.-origin highly enriched uranium (HEU) spent 
fuel.  The SAG is receptive to moving forward on a number of 
nuclear cooperation initiatives (Ref C), but is sensitive to 
appear even-handed between the U.S. and French governments in 
the run-up to awarding the contract for new nuclear power 
plants.  This will make it difficult to launch new bilateral 
nuclear initiatives in the near term.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Success Story on Return of U.S.-Origin HEU Spent 
Fuel: Minerals/Energy Officer delivered the message in Ref A 
to Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) Chief Director: 
Nuclear Tseliso Maqubela on October 10 that the remaining 
issues had been resolved and the SAG could now move forward 
on implementing the program for the return of U.S.-origin HEU 
spent fuel.  Per Ref A instructions, Minerals/Energy Officer 
passed the data-sheet on South Africa HEU inventory and 
informed Maqubela that DOE National Nuclear Security 
Administration (NNSA) would follow up with details on 
implementation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Bilateral Agreement on Cooperation on R&D in 
Nuclear Technology: Minerals/Energy Officer delivered draft 
points that DOE is ready to move forward on signing this 
agreement and is waiting to discuss with the SAG details on 
where and when to plan the signing.  Maqubela said that the 
DME was eager to move forward on this initiative, noting that 
the DME was close to achieving its SAG inter-agency signing 
authority. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Maqubela stated that DME wished to move forward on 
a number of multilateral and bilateral nuclear initiatives 
already well underway, noting that he was still in 
discussions with the DOE on the Global Nuclear Energy 
Partnership (Ref C).  He stated, however, that his staff was 
stretched thin and his office's priority was new build of 
nuclear power plants.  Repeating an earlier theme, Maqubela 
stressed that his staff would have to be careful to appear 
even-handed with the U.S. and French governments (since 
Westinghouse and Areva are the contenders).  Therefore, he 
stated that it may be difficult to advance the Joint Standing 
Committe on Nuclear Cooperation (JSCNC) at this time, since 
it would be a new bilateral initiative with the U.S. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Economic Counselor and Minerals/Energy Officer will 
meet with DME Deputy Director General for Electricity and 
Nuclear Energy Nelisiwe Magubane on October 16 to seek to 
advance these nuclear and other initiatives. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT: Post believes that a more flexible 
approach would be more likely to secure South Africa's 
participation in the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership 
(GNEP).  The obstacle has been South Africa's reluctance to 
forgo the option of uranium enrichment as a perceived 
condition of membership, because of its published plans to 
beneficiate its uranium reserves and supply its budding 
nuclear power capacity, while maintaining its international 
non-proliferation obligations.  Including an acknowledgement 
of South Africa's intention to consider enrichment for its 
own use could help the country over this obstacle.  Bringing 
South Africa into the GNEP fold as a key "southern" partner 
could later assist in recruiting other developing countries 
to participate in GNEP. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED: Minerals/Energy Officer called 
Maqubela on October 10 amid afternoon thunderstorms, rolling 
black-outs, and consequent traffic jams.  He complained that 
his DME offices were dark because of Eskom's load shedding 
power cuts due to unseasonable cold, rainy weather and 
planned and unplanned outages at power plants, resulting in a 
shortfall in power capacity of about 20 percent.  Maqubela 
has no illusions about the need to move forward quickly to 
address South Africa's growing demand for electric power.
