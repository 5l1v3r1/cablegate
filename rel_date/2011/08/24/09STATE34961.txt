SUBJECT: RECOGNITION OF OUTSTANDING SUPPORT OF BLUE 
LANTERN PROGRAM: DAVID HOWELL AND NATALIE AHN 
 
¶1. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
outstanding performance of political-military officers David 
Howell and Natalie Ahn in supporting the Blue Lantern 
program.  As you know, Blue Lantern is the Department's 
primary instrument for monitoring the end-use of exported 
defense articles, technology, and services.  This program is 
indispensable to PM's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls 
(PM/DDTC) in making informed licensing decisions, discovering 
illicit supply networks, and deterring diversions of U.S. 
military articles and technology. 
 
¶2. Mr. Howell and Ms. Ahn have be integral to the 
Department,s implementation of new enhanced end-use 
monitoring measures required by Section 1228 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act of 2008.  They took the lead on 
preparing and executing a Blue Lantern outreach visit to 
Baghdad in February 2009, which achieved its primary 
objective of ensuring the effective coordination of PM/DDTC, 
the Embassy team, and MNSTC-I.  Throughout the visit, Mr. 
Howell and Ms. Ahn demonstrated professionalism in very 
hostile environments. 
 
¶3. The PM Bureau and the Department are grateful for the 
efforts of Mr. Howell and Ms. Ahn, which have demonstrably 
contributed to the security and integrity of U.S. defense 
trade.
