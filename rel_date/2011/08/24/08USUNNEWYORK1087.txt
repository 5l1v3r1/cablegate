SUBJECT: UNGA: 63RD GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADOPTS RESOLUTION ON 
PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT BY REDUCING ARMED CONFLICT 
 
REF: STATE 121392 
 
¶1.  During its November 17, morning session, the 63rd General 
Assembly held a debate on agenda items 107, follow up to the 
outcome of the Millennium Summit; 44, integrated and 
coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes 
of the major UN conferences; and 112, strengthening of the UN 
system.  During the session, the General Assembly adopted a 
resolution by consensus on "Promoting development through the 
reduction and prevention of armed violence" (A/63/L.27). 
 
¶2.  Switzerland introduced and the General Assembly adopted 
by consensus resolution A/63/L.27, "Promoting development 
through the reduction and prevention of armed violence." 
During the debate, France stated that while it supported the 
Geneva Declaration, it disagreed with the resolutions link 
between arms reduction and development.  France's 
representative said that the relationship between the two was 
more complex than the wording implied, however, France would 
not block consensus.  Per Department instructions, USUN gave 
a pre-action EOP (Ref A).  In post-action EOP's, Egypt and 
Pakistan stated their reservations.  Egypt would have 
preferred a greater reference to the principles UN Charter. 
Pakistan noted that in each of the past negotiations of the 
Geneva Declaration, Pakistan's objections and amendments have 
been disregarded. 
 
¶3.  Venezuela introduced a resolution that calls for a Summit 
on the global financial crisis (A/63/L.22).  During the 
debate India, Nicaragua, Russia, Cuba, Argentina, France, and 
Algeria gave interventions.  Except France, all the speakers 
gave support for the resolution introduced by Venezuela, 
calling for reform of the world's financial architecture, 
particularly the Bretton Woods institutions.  Nicaragua 
expressed condemnation for capitalism, which had resulted in 
the current crisis.  Russia also expressed support for the 
resolution on global health and foreign policy. 
 
¶4.  Switzerland introduced a resolution on the legal 
empowerment of the poor (A/63/L.25).  South Africa introduced 
a resolution on global health and foreign policy (A/63/L.28). 
 Tanzania introduced a draft International Labour 
Organization declaration on social justice for a fair 
globalization (A/63/L.29).  Action on all these items will 
take place at a later date, to be announced.  USUN is 
participating in ongoing informal negotiations.
