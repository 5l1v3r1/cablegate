SUBJECT:  Proposal for 2008 Julia Taft (Ambassador's) Fund 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  This is a proposal for value-added production training 
from Zardozi, an Afghan non-profit organization.  The project would 
train 20-30 women in eastern Afghanistan in value-added textile 
production for international and domestic markets.  This project 
will bring the current value-added jobs in Pakistan back to 
Afghanistan and provide important livelihood opportunities for 
women.  The project is small enough to be funded by the 2008 Julia 
Taft Fund. 
 
Project Description 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Zardozi is one of the only NGOs in Afghanistan that produces 
high-quality embroidered items for the international market.  They 
also focus on richly embroidered wedding apparel that is essential 
in Afghan weddings in Afghanistan and among the Afghan diaspora. 
The project would train 6-8 women in transforming the individual 
embroidered pieces (made by 1,000 Zardozi-supported home producers) 
into finished products, e.g., turning a $1 embroidered square into 
an $8 garment.  The project would also train 6-12 women in silk 
weaving and another 6-8 women in high-end silk product 
manufacturing.  The project director will also confer with artisanal 
producers in Cambodia who rebuilt their family incomes after their 
civil war by turning individual handicraft items into high-value 
finished products.  Although the Cambodian producers were originally 
intended to come to Afghanistan, due to security concerns, the 
project director will go to Cambodia and bring back their 
suggestions and designs. The project will also employ 2-3 office 
staffers to handle the project's administrative and logistical 
issues. 
 
Justification 
------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Many women in eastern Afghanistan are returned refugees 
who are marginalized in Afghanistan's conservative culture and have 
no means to contribute to the family income.  Embroidery is part of 
Afghan culture and generally a specialist female skill.  Zardozi 
already has 1,000 home embroiderers but their output is taken to 
Pakistan for manufacturing into a finished product.  This project 
would train women in Afghanistan to do that value-added tailoring 
work.  The silk production project will also be the first time women 
have been trained in Afghanistan on silk production weaving looms, 
traditionally reserved for men.  While many NGOs train women in 
tailoring and embroidery with no specific market access or quality 
target in mind, Zardozi's bottomline-based approach stresses high 
quality and direct market linkages.  Zardozi, more than almost any 
other NGO, has the highest likelihood of increasing women's incomes 
in a very real sense.  The beneficiaries will be drawn from the 
eastern provinces of Afghanistan, which have the highest refugee 
return rate in the country.  As of this year, 74,000 of the year's 
111,000 returns are in the east.  Zardozi will ensure that at least 
50% of the beneficiaries are  returnees.
