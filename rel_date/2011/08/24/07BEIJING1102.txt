Six-Party Talks Working Groups, Financial Issues 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. MFA Spokesperson Jiang Yu outlined the organization 
of Six-Party Talks working groups at the February 15 
regular press briefing.  The ROK will chair the 
economic and energy cooperation group.  Russia will 
chair the Northeast Asia peace and security mechanism 
group.  The United States, DPRK and Japan will 
respectively chair other working groups.  Jiang said 
that financial issues were to be handled between the 
United States and DPRK through negotiation and 
dialogue, when asked for comment on reports that an 
American official call for financial questions to be 
resolved within 30 days.  Asked about Japan's 
reluctance to provide aid before the abduction 
question is resolved, Jiang said China hopes Japan 
would fulfill its obligations under the agreement and 
actively participate in the denuclearization process. 
 
¶3. Jiang would not clarify whether suspension of 
activity at Yongbyon would be temporary or permanent, 
simply referring reporters to the text of the 
agreement for details.  She stated the 
denuclearization action plan agreed upon Tuesday was 
an "important step forward" signifying the Six-Party 
Talks have entered a "substantive stage."  The 
spokeswoman expressed China's hope that all parties 
would honor their commitments and implement the 
necessary actions. 
 
United States-China Trade Mutually Beneficial 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Asked to comment on reports that three U.S. 
Senators want to rescind China's most favored nations 
trading status, Jiang said the two countries are 
important trading partners that reap tangible benefits 
with over 21 percent growth in trade last year.  China 
is ready to expand imports from the United States to 
reduce the trade deficit and hopes for the relaxation 
of high-tech export restrictions.  China has increased 
its crackdown on piracy with "firm resolve and 
achievement," she said. 
 
China-India-Russia Joint Communique 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5. The foreign ministers of China, India and Russia 
met February 14 in New Delhi to discuss "cooperation 
in key areas," said Jiang.  The Korean Peninsula, the 
Middle East, Iraq, Afghanistan, East Asian 
cooperation, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and 
other topics were addressed during these trilateral 
talks.  The three countries' cooperation aims for 
peace and stability and is not directed at any third 
party, Jiang said. 
 
New UNSC Resolution on Iran? 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6. Responding to reports that Undersecretary Burns 
called for a new UNSC resolution on Iran, Jiang said 
the international community should increase diplomatic 
and political efforts to resume dialogue and achieve a 
 
BEIJING 00001102  002 OF 002 
 
 
lasting and comprehensive solution. 
 
FM Li Meets with Leaders in Japan 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing will arrive in Japan 
February 15 and meet the speaker of the House of 
Representatives, chief cabinet secretary, PM Abe and 
FM Aso, Jiang said when asked about the visit.  Li 
will promote bilateral ties, prepare for PM Wen's 
April visit to Japan and attempt to maintain the 
momentum of improved relations between the two 
countries. 
 
Open Attitude Toward Europe-Africa Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶8. China has taken note of a meeting this morning in 
France on cooperation between European and African 
countries and maintains an open and positive attitude 
toward the event.  China has held dialogue with 
European and African countries on development in 
Africa and is ready for further consultation in this 
regard. 
 
Question on Dr. Gao Yaojie Deflected
