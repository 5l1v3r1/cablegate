SUBJECT: German Out-Of-Area Deployment Update 
 
REF:  Berlin 2634 
 
¶1. (SBU) As of May 13, Germany had 7,438 military personnel 
(compared to 7,993 on April 10) in out-of-area deployments.  All 
military out-of-area (OOA) deployments, with the exception of 
observers such as in Georgia (where currently 11 military personnel 
are deployed under UNOMIG), require parliamentary approval.  A law 
regulates the parliamentary process, allowing expedited procedures 
only for non-controversial deployments.  What follows is a brief 
run-down on Germany's current OOA deployments.  (Note: OOA 
deployments are defined as deployments outside the territory of the 
NATO member states. End Note) 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Bundeswehr has 3,185 military personnel operating in 
Afghanistan under the UNSC mandate for ISAF.  Based on the March 9 
Bundestag decision to deploy Tornado reconnaissance aircraft, the 
ceiling for the deployment was raised from 3,000 to 3,500 personnel. 
 Germany commands ISAF's northern region (RC-North), where it leads 
two of the five Provincial Reconstruction Teams (Kunduz and 
Feyzabad) as well as the Forward Support Base in Mazar-E-Sharif. 
The mandate limits the Bundeswehr's operations to Kabul and 
RC-North, but Germany can provide assistance outside that sector 
provided it is of limited time and scope and essential for the 
mission.  For example, in early May, at the request of ISAF, Defense 
Minister Jung approved the temporary deployment (three to four 
weeks) of a three-man Pysops team to southern Afghanistan. 
Meanwhile, the Tornados are allowed to operate throughout 
Afghanistan.  Both ISAF mandates -- the general mandate for the 
Bundeswehr deployment in ISAF as well as the Tornado deployment -- 
expire on October 13, 2007. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Germany is the lead for UNIFIL's naval component and has 
791 (compared to 853 in April) military personnel deployed.  The 
parliamentary mandate, which has a ceiling of 2,400 personnel, 
expires on August 31, 2007, at the same time as the UN mandate. 
 
------------------- 
Kosovo Force (KFOR) 
------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Germany has 2,308 military personnel (compared to 2,832 in 
April) under the KFOR mandate, which provides for a ceiling of 8,500 
total personnel.  In March, Germany temporarily deployed 550 reserve 
forces to Kosovo as part of "Operation Determined Effort," which was 
intended to demonstrate KFOR's crisis reaction capabilities.  That 
operation has since ended, and the German reserve forces have 
re-deployed back to home station, accounting for the drop in German 
numbers since April.  The mandate extends automatically unless there 
is a change to the UNSC Resolution framework for the Kosovo Force. 
 
----------------------------------- 
European Union Force (EUFOR) Bosnia 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Germany currently has 810 soldiers (compared to 822 in 
April) in Bosnia as part of the EU's Operation ALTHEA.  The mandate, 
amended on December 1, 2006, allows up to 2,400 military personnel. 
This operation extends automatically unless there is a change to its 
underlying UNSC resolution.  Security conditions permitting, the 
German government has announced it intends to reduce its military 
presence in coordination with its allies during 2007. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The German Navy has 247 (243 in April) military personnel 
operating in the Horn of Africa under OEF.  The OEF mandate, which 
provides for a ceiling of 1,800 personnel, also covers the 
deployment of Special Forces for counterterrorism operations in 
Afghanistan.  There are currently no acknowledged German OEF forces 
in Afghanistan.  The OEF mandate also covers contributions to NATO's 
Operation Active Endeavor (OAE).  The OEF mandate extends through 
November 15, 2007. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Germany currently has 39 military observers (same number as 
 
BERLIN 00000990  002 OF 002 
 
 
in April) in UNMIS, monitoring the implementation of the peace 
agreement.  The parliament imposed a caveat barring military 
observers from going to Darfur without prior consultation with the 
Bundestag Foreign Relations Committee's chairman and ranking 
members.  The mandate allows the participation of up to 75 military 
observers.  On March 28, the German cabinet approved to extend the 
deployment for another six months.  The Bundestag approved the 
extension April 27. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The German Air Force provides logistical support for the AU 
mission in Darfur - primarily airlift into and out of theater for 
rotating AMIS forces.  The mandate allows up to 200 military 
personnel.  There currently are no German soldiers in-theater.  The 
mandate will expire June 2, 2007. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Other minor deployments: 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Two military observers serve in Ethiopia and Eritrea for 
the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE).  One 
German military observer is seconded to the United Nation Assistance 
Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).  The Bundeswehr has seconded 41 
military personnel to Strategic Medical Evacuation 
(STRATAIRMEDEVAC), for which no parliamentary mandate is required, 
as it is not defined as an armed deployment and the aircraft are on 
stand-by in Germany.
