Acting Polchief delivered reftel demarche to Ambassador Patrice 
Cure, Head of Multilateral Division at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, making the additional point that since 
Mauritius as a rule does not support "single-country resolutions," 
it should support "single-country bodies" even less. Ambassador Cure 
responded that Mauritius, while a supporter of the Quartet peace 
efforts, has traditionally supported the pro-Palestinian bodies at 
the UN. He implied that change on this subject is unlikely.
