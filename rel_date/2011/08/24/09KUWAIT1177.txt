¶1. (U) Kuwaiti news media widely reported on December 12 the 
arrival in Kuwait for medical treatment of 20 Yemeni 
civilians allegedly injured by rebel fighting in Yemen's 
Saada province. Press accounts noted that the victims were 
transported from Yemen on a Kuwaiti medical evacuation 
aircraft.  All 20 are being treated at Jaber Ahmad Al-Sabah 
Hospital, Yemeni Embassy Counselor Intisar Al-Noman confirmed 
to Embassy on December 15. 
 
¶2. (U) Comment:  The GOK routinely uses hospital diplomacy to 
aid its policy goals, to include highly publicized treatment 
of Palestinians and Iraqis (reftels), and now Yemenis.  The 
message in this case is clearly one of support for Yemeni 
President Saleh, a trope that featured prominently in the 
Amir's speech to the GCC earlier this week.  End comment.
