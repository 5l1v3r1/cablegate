REF:  STATE 176592 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, Post Blue Lantern Action Officer contacted 
Rockwell Collins France regarding export license 05-1001634 
involving the delivery of helicopter parts and communication 
system components.  The Department was concerned about the 
excessive number of intermediate consignees.  Rockwell Collins 
Manager for Contracts Philippe Bardet contacted econoff by 
letter on November 15. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bardet confirmed the delivery of helicopter parts under 
license number 05-1001634 to IAR Brasov for final end use by the 
Romanian Airforce.  He noted that, within the Rockwell Collins 
Group, Rockwell Collins France was responsible for commercial 
relations with Romania, which is the reason that Rockwell 
Collins France was the purchaser for the IAR Brasov. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Bardet, Rockwell Collins France delivered 
the products directly from the U.S. to Romania and did not take 
possession of the goods.  He confirmed, however, that the "Data 
Loaders DL-8171" did not contain U.S.-origin frequency hopping 
algorithms.  Neither did they permit access to frequency hopping 
algorithms nor the functions of ECCM/frequency hopping of the 
USG.  Finally, Bardet confirmed that none of the following was 
released to any third-party entity:  USG datalink message 
standards/formats and Have Quick IIA and the USG version of the 
SINCGARS.
