Main Stories: 
------------- 
All dailies lead with wire reports of an Israel-radio announcement 
(June 28) that Israeli Defense Minister Barak will propose a 
"limited freezing" of settlement activities for three months in 
response to the US pressure.  Barak will be discussing this proposal 
on July 29 during his meeting with US Envoy Mitchell in New York, 
according to reporting.  The proposal will exclude "settlement 
activities" in Jerusalem and will not prohibit the construction of 
2000 units in there.  Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam also report that Israeli 
settlers expect settlements to continue growing despite U.S. 
pressure. 
 
The three dailies front page reports that Hamas and Fatah will 
pursue national reconciliation talks in Cairo on June 28.  According 
to reports, Egypt is determined to end the conflict between the two 
factions, and produce a reconciliation agreement made on July 7. 
Fatah senior official Sha'ath stated that a committee has been 
formed to discuss the issue of political prisoners, adding that the 
talks intend to tackle three major issues: 1) Legislative elections 
2) formation of a committee with all factions to establish a 
national unity government in accordance with an Egyptian proposal 3) 
restructuring the security forces. 
 
Al-Quds reports that the U.S. and EU agreement with an Egyptian 
initiative to include Hamas in a "comprehensive political process" 
that would include a permanent cease-fire with Israel, the 
achievement of internal Palestinian reconciliation and the pursuit 
of negotiations with Israel based on the Arab Peace Initiative.  The 
report also discusses the visit by a U.S. official to Damascus two 
weeks ago, who is quoted in Saudi-based daily Al-Hayat stating, 
"Hamas officials have recently announced important statements that 
are worth consideration." 
 
Al-Quds' and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's front pages report on a fact 
finding committee assigned by the U.N. to look into Israeli 
violations committed against civilians during the recent "war in 
Gaza."  The committee began hearings on June 28, calling Palestinian 
civilians who alleged abuse by Israeli forces during the conflict. 
 
Al-Quds's and Al-Ayyam's front pages report that Palestinian 
Authority(PA) Prime Minister Fayyad will be traveling to the U.S. 
next week to meet with U.S. officials and discuss recent 
developments in the Palestinian Territories.  Fayyad will also 
discuss the financial crisis faced by the PA in large part due to 
the delay in receipt of financial assistance from the donor 
community. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's and Al-Ayyam's front pages include reports by 
the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Health that 11 new cases of 
H1N1 have been reported in the areas of Nablus and Ramallah, 
increasing the total number of cases in the West Bank to 26. 
 
-------------- 
Weekend stories: 
-------------- 
Al Quds' front page gives details on alleged Israeli plans to expand 
Jerusalem area settlement Maale Adumim, "from Nabi Mousa to Sai'r." 
Reports claim that Israel has attempted to seize more than 129,000 
acres of land in the Eastern area of the West Bank in order to then 
register them with the Maale Adumim land registration office under 
the pretext that they have been abandoned, coverage notes.  Chief 
Palestinian Authority negotiator Quray, called upon President Obama 
 
JERUSALEM 00001092  002 OF 002 
 
 
to quickly intervene to stop such Israeli measures on Palestinian 
lands.  Quray warned the international community that land 
confiscation and settlement expansion by Israelis in the West Bank 
and Jerusalem will lead to more violence in the region as a whole. 
 
 
"Pessimistic atmosphere overshadows meetings: Fatah and Hamas resume 
dialogue in Cairo in attempt to end disagreements" (Al Quds, Al 
Ayyam, Al Hayat Al Jadida): The sixth round of Palestinian national 
dialogue took place in Cairo over the weekend between Fatah and 
Hamas. The meeting was overshadowed by doubt and pessimism, based 
upon accusations between the two parties regarding political arrests 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Reporting concluded that on-going 
bi-lateral meetings have failed so far, despite Egypt's proposal 
that an agreement ending the division would be reached by July 7th. 
 
 
"Israeli army conducts operations in Farahin area, closes Jaba' and 
A'tara checkpoints for hours- Settlers attack Palestinian houses in 
Silwan and Israeli soldiers attack Palestinians and peace activists 
in Bayt Ummar" (Al Quds, Al Ayyam, Al Hayat Al Jadida).  All dailies 
front paged news that three Palestinians were injured by Israeli 
settler fire when settlers attacked Palestinian houses in Silwan 
neighbourhood in Jerusalem. Israeli police forces at the scene are 
alleged to have prevented ambulances from rescuing the wounded. 
Additionally, seven Palestinians and peace activists, (foreign and 
Israeli) were injured in a conflict with the Israeli army in Bayt 
Ummar, north of Hebron during their0 weekly protests.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al-Quds editorial, "Again, useless dialogue!"(06/29): "It is 
awkward that everyone is focusing extensively on national 
dialogue... The dialogue succeeded in distracting our attention away 
from the real challenges that face our people and our cause, 
including settlement activities, violations against Jerusalem, the 
siege, arrests... It is time for the factions discussing in Cairo to 
realize that their division has not halted any Israeli measures. 
They should listen to each other and to their people in order to put 
an end to these crises [division and its implications]". 
 
2) Omar Hilmi Al-Ghoul, Al-Ayyam:  "Will the U.S. be deceived?" 
(06/29):  "The U.S. administration knows how to manage Israeli 
tricks [Barak's proposal of a temporary freeze in settlement 
activities]... The question remains - will U.S. officials let Barak 
get away with his proposal or will they ask him to completely halt 
settlements if Israel really wants its strategic relations with the 
U.S. to continue?"
