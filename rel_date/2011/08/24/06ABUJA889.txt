TABLE 
 
REF: ABUJA 856 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU)  Summary: The African Union Mediation put the 
final security arrangements text on the negotiating table 
April 22, which has generated serious discussions of the 
future status of the movements' forces between the Government 
of Sudan and the rebels.  AU Special Envoy Salim Salim said 
he will put forward all elements of the entire peace package 
on April 25 and that he expects the international partners to 
deliver the parties.  USDEL is actively facilitating small 
group discussions between the GOS and Sudan Liberation 
Movement faction leader Minni Minnawi, at the request of both 
parties.  JEM also has expressed its desire for the presence 
of a USDEL member in its meetings with the GOS, but has yet 
to follow through on it.  With VP Taha still in Abuja playing 
an active role, direct engagement between the GOS and 
Movements over key issues is intensifying now that the 
mediation has moved the final security arrangements paper 
forward.  End Summary.

¶2.  (SBU)  On April 22, African Union Special Envoy Salim 
Salim updated USDEL on the mediation's plans.  Salim promised 
to put the entire peace package on the negotiating table on 
April 25.  He stated that the AU's job was to put out a good 
package and the international partners' responsibility to get 
the parties' to accept it.  Salim also expressed concern over 
a press statement in Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) faction 
leader Minni Minnawi's name, accusing the Government of Sudan 
of bad faith.  The press statement also said that Minni would 
terminate participation in the talks if not concluded by 
April 30 .  USDEL advised Salim to look at Minnawi's 
statement as an opportunity to get the entire peace deal to 
the parties, instead of reacting as if it were a genuine 
threat.  The AU Mediation did put the final security 
arrangements package on the negotiating table on April 22 and 
is holding discussions on the paper on April 24.

TAHA CONSULTATIONS

¶3.  (SBU)  Sudanese Vice-President Ali Osman Taha and members 
of his delegation continue consultations with the parties. 
Taha's dialogue with Minni Minnawi hit a small snag over 
differing understandings of what has been accepted in their 
meetings.  USDEL is facilitating further dialogue to clear up 
and record meeting results at the request of both parties. 
On April 23, USDEL attended a meeting between Minni and 
Mutrif Sadiq to clarify the positions on the final security 
arrangements on which there are different interpretations. 
On April 24, USDEL met with Taha in advance of his meeting 
with Minni.  Taha explained his understanding of the 
positions of both sides on integration, returnees/IDPs, 
redeployment of SAF and allied forces, and a timetable.  Taha 
asked whether the confusion is due to Minni's 
misunderstanding of the concept of integration, troubles 
within the movement, or confusion over the process of the 
discussions.  USDEL said that it is difficult to determine 
exactly what caused Minni's apparent backtracking or perhaps 
misunderstanding, but that it could probably be overcome 
after more discussions. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) members told 
USDEL that their meetings with Taha have been useful so far. 
A small working group was formed on power-sharing issues to 
work through the competencies of senior level representation 
at the center.  JEM also has suggested that a USDEL member 
sit in on their discussions but have not pursued it any 
farther.  For now, the GOS's strategy appears to be to secure 
agreement with Minni on security arrangements, one key issue 
on power-sharing with SLM's Abdelwahid Nur, with the 
conviction that JEM will follow suit.

COMMENT 
- - - - 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  The release of the final security arrangements 
document gave the parties the opportunity to seriously 
discuss key sticking points on the future status of the 
movements forces and to open the way to presentation of the 
comprehensive package of all the texts.  We expect a similar 
level of activity and engagement between the parties when the 
power and wealth-sharing documents are made public.  Requests 
for USDEL facilitation of GOS-movement discussions, drafting 
assistance for the final package and continuing military 
technical assistance will likely increase on this final lap.
