On September 21, PolOff delivered reftel demarche to the 
Directorate of International Law Minister Counselor, Milen 
Lyutskanov.  Noting the recent assassination of Lebanese 
Parliament member Antione Ghanem, Lyutskanov said this region 
is very important for donor countries.  Lyutskanov said that 
Bulgaria has been active in this region and willing to help, 
but that he could not immediately say what contribution from 
Bulgaria would be viable.  Lyutskanov will distribute 
non-paper on issue to relevant GOB decision makers.
