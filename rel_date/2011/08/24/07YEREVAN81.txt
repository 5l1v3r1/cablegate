SUBJECT: ARMENIANS REMEMBER HRANT DINK WITH VIGILS, MARCHES 
AND RALLIES 
 
¶1. Bearing signs that read "We are all Hrants," in 
acknowledgment of similar slogans borne by protesters in 
Istanbul, several thousand Armenians attended a January 23 
memorial gathering for slain Armenian-Turkish journalist 
Hrant Dink at Yerevan's Freedom Square.  Event organizers, a 
small ad hoc group consisting largely of young diasporan 
transplants, as well as acquaintances of Dink, spoke in 
English and in Armenian about the tragedy of his death. 
Aside from a few signs calling for "genocide" recognition, 
the portion of the event attended by CDA and Poloff was free 
of unhelpful rhetoric; none was reported in the local press 
on January 24, either.  CDA was swarmed by cameras and voice 
recorders within minutes of walking into the crowd at the 
event, and his comments about the tragedy and hope for 
normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations were widely 
broadcast. 
 
¶2. The event was one of many that have been held in Dink's 
honor since January 20, including a candlelight vigil and a 
protest march that ended at the European Union office in 
downtown Yerevan.  Crowds at the first two events, advertised 
mainly by text message and e-mail, were only in the dozens. 
The organizers publicized the January 23 gathering on 
television and radio to increase attendance.  Deputy Foreign 
Minister Gegham Gharibjanian attended the rally; DFM Arman 
Kirakossian attended Dink's funeral in Istanbul.  A march to 
the "genocide" memorial was planned for January 24 (COMMENT: 
We suspect this event to be more politicized, given its 
location.  END COMMENT.)
