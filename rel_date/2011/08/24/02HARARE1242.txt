¶1.   (U) A Harare magistrate has postponed the hearing 
    for two journalists arrested on May 1 for "publishing 
    falsehoods." "Guardian" correspondent Andrew Meldrum 
    (an American citizen) and "Daily News" reporter Lloyd 
    Mudiwa appeared in court on May 22, expecting their 
    case would be heard.  Instead, the magistrate postponed 
    the hearing to May 30.  Both reporters face charges 
    related to a now-disproven story about a woman beheaded 
    by ruling party supporters. 
 
¶2.   (SBU) Harare-based journalists have told us that 
    the presiding magistrate finds no merit in the charges 
    against Meldrum and Mudiwa and wants to dismiss the 
    case, but has been prevented from doing so by high- 
    level political pressure.
