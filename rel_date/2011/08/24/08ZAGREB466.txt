(SBU) Ambassador delivered Ref A points to Foreign Minister 
Gordan Jandrokovic on June 20.  Ambassador also noted that he 
would be raising our concerns directly with INA CEO 
Dragicevic.  FM Jandrokovic responded by re-affirming that 
Croatia's policy would be to continue to support all UNSC 
efforts on Iran sanctions, together with the US and the EU, 
and that Croatia was determined to remain fully compliant 
with the UN sanction regime.  He noted that he was aware of 
the INA deal with Iran, but that he will contact Dragicevic 
to get more information.  He said that the GoC's current 
understanding was that this deal was consistent with the 
current sanctions regime, and that it was not dissimilar to 
what other companies "such as OMV or Shell" are doing Iran. 
Jandrokovic also noted that Croatia understood some U.S. 
companies had business interests in Iran, mentioning 
Coca-Cola and others, but no energy firms.  The Ambassador 
noted that we were particularly concerned with energy 
investments, and drew on Ref B information to underline that, 
while some firms continued to seek business with Iran, 
several European companies were putting planned projects on 
hold.  FM Jandrokovic said he would discuss the US demarche 
within the GoC and with INA, and provide a considered 
response.
