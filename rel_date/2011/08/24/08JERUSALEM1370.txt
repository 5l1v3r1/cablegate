SUBJECT: MULTIPLE IDF INCURSIONS NABLUS; PA INVESTIGATING 
CAUSE OF WAREHOUSE FIRE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) PA security officials told PolOff and POL FSN July 
29 that the IDF entered Nablus late July 28 and early July 
29, arresting three Fatah members, including M'amun al-Safadi 
in the Nablus Kasbah (Old City) and occupied a five-story 
building for four hours.  Nablus Governor Jamal Muhaysin told 
POL FSN that the incursions were not coordinated with the PA 
and have become a "daily embarrassment" to PA security forces. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Governor Muhaysin and PA security officials told 
POL FSN that the PA is investigating an early July 29 fire 
that burned the Qasr Hindiya furniture warehouse to the 
ground, causing an estimated USD 3 million in damages and 
commercial losses.  Palestinian media reported that the fire 
was likely caused by Israeli smoke grenades and flash-bang 
devices (the IDF was operating in the vicinity of the 
warehouse before the fire started), but Muhaysin and other PA 
officials said the fire's cause is not clear and must be 
investiagted.  The building's owner said arson related to 
Fatah-Hamas feuding is also a possible cause.
