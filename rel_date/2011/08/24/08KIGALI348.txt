REF: STATE 51523 
 
¶1. (U) Econoff presented reftel talking points to Dr. Richard 
Masozera, Director General of Rwanda Civil Aviation 
Authority.  Dr. Masozera was just appointed to his current 
position six weeks ago and was not aware of ICOA's Aviation 
Security Panel of Experts (AVSECP) meeting scheduled to meet 
in Montreal May 26-30.  Dr. Masozera took note of USG 
proposals for the AVSECP meeting and said that he would 
contact the Rwanda Embassy in Canada and "request that they 
attend the meeting and support the USG positions." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment: Dr.Masozera was not aware of the AVSECP 
meeting and was unfamiliar with the issues raised in reftel. 
However, the Director General appeared well disposed to the 
proposals and although new to his position, his 
recommendation will carry weight with the GOR.
