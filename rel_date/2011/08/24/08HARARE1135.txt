¶1. (U) Despite the Government of Zimbabwe's self-imposed 
isolation on most diplomatic issues, local intelligence and 
criminal investigative agencies were responsive to our 
counterterrorism needs. Government agencies routinely 
provided assistance by conducting investigative inquiries, 
traces, and border checks of individuals thought to be 
threats to USG facilities or personnel. However, Zimbabwe's 
continued economic decline has had a detrimental impact on 
local law enforcement and national security elements that are 
responsible for implementing and coordinating 
counterterrorism efforts. 
 
¶2. (U) Although generally cooperative, the Zimbabwe Republic 
Police (ZRP) in October suspended armed police coverage of 
the Embassy and USAID compounds in Harare. Attempts to enter 
into a dialogue with the ZRP and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to resolve the issue have proven unsuccessful. 
 
¶3. (U) The Suppression of Foreign and International 
Terrorism Bill, enacted in August 2007 to combat terrorism 
and mercenary activities in Zimbabwe, has been redirected to 
suppress the political opposition. Between late October and 
early November, 15 members of the opposition Movement for 
Democratic Change (MDC) party were abducted and held 
incommunicado on allegations of receiving training in 
terrorism, sabotage, and banditry in Botswana. An additional 
15 MDC and civil society members have since been abducted by 
armed, plainclothes men. The ZRP has denied holding any of 
the abductees.
