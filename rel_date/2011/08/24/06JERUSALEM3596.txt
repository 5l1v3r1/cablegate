Military Developments 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.    (SBU) Overall violence in the Gaza Strip continued at 
low levels during the weekend of August 11-13.  There were no 
reported Qassam rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel.  PIJ 
militants, however, launched two rockets on August 14 from 
northern Gaza in the direction of Ashkelon.  One rocket 
landed near Ashkelon's industrial zone which resulted in some 
light injuries -- mostly shock -- but no property damage. 
The IAF responded with rocket fire into northern Gaza at 
suspected rocket launch sites, killing three Palestinians, 
reportedly Palestinian farmers working in fields near Beit 
Hanoun.  Three Palestinian civilians were injured August 13 
by Israeli tank and naval fire in the vicinity of Jabaliya 
refugee camp and Beit Hanoun.  Several Israeli tanks and 
other IDF vehicles entered August 12 the al-Jaradat 
neighborhood near Rafah to conduct land clearing.  There were 
no reported clashes or injuries during the operation. 
Egyptian security forces on August 12 destroyed a tunnel used 
for weapons smuggling from Egypt into Gaza. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) In the West Bank, the IDF conducted raids into 
villages near Jenin in search of suspected militants, 
arresting two Fatah activists in Qabatiyah village the 
evening of August 11.  IDF soldiers shot and wounded on 
August 12 a Palestinian youth who attempted to circumvent the 
Zatara checkpoint south of Nablus.  The IDF arrested five 
Palestinians overnight August 13-14 in Ramallah, Nablus, and 
Jenin.  PIJ gunmen summarily executed August 13 a suspected 
Palestinian collaborator in connection with the August 9 
Israeli air strike in the Jenin refugee camp that killed two 
PIJ activists, including the head of the PIJ military wing in 
Jenin. 
 
Humanitarian Update 
------------------- 
 
¶4.    (SBU)  The Rafah crossing is closed August 14, as it 
was August 12 and 13, according to USAID Gaza-based staff. 
Rafah was open August 10 and 11 for departures from Gaza 
only, enabling approximately 4000 people to depart Gaza into 
Egypt. 
 
¶5.    (SBU)  The Karni/al-Mintar and Nahal Oz crossings are 
open August 14, as they were August 13, according to USAID 
Gaza-based staff.  Both Karni/al-Mintar and Nahal Oz 
crossings were closed August 12, as usual, for the Jewish 
Sabbath.  The Karni/al-Mintar crossing processed 118 
truckloads into Gaza on August 11, the last date for which 
throughput information is available.  According to USAID 
calculations, there is only a two-day supply of wheat flour 
remaining in Gaza, the lowest level since IDF military 
operations commenced in Gaza in late June. 
 
¶6.    (SBU)  All ten electricity feeder lines from Israel 
into Gaza are operational on August 14, according to USAID 
Gaza-based staff.
