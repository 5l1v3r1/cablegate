SUBJECT: EMBASSY LONDON PLANS FOR DAY OF SOLIDARITY WITH 
THE CUBAN PEOPLE 
 
REF: A. STATE 45792 
 
     ¶B. STATE 46997 
 
¶1. Action request for Department.  Embassy London plans to 
mark the May 21 "Day of Solidarity with the Cuban People" by 
placing an op-ed in a local newspaper.  We request that WHA 
provide the text for this placement. 
 
¶2.  In addition, Embassy London is working with the NGO 
"English PEN" to mark the occasion.  PEN advocates for 
freedom of expression around the world and calls attention to 
the plight of persecuted and imprisoned writers.  We plan to 
invite leaders of the organization to brief the Embassy on 
its work in Cuba and possibly hold a joint press event, 
depending on PEN's concurrence.  Embassy will keep the 
Department informed as plans firm up. 
 
¶3.  FCO contacts were intrigued by the occasion but told 
Poloff that HMG plans to keep a low profile on Cuba leading 
up the sensitive June EU meeting in which the EU common 
position will be discussed.
