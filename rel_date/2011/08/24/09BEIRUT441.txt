SUBJECT:  Lebanon: Media Reaction - April 16, 2009 
 
Atmospherics: 
------------- 
 
The press continued to give top billing to the Army's efforts to 
arrest the criminals who attacked the Army Patrol killing four 
soldiers.  The press also continued to highlight the "growing" 
conflict between Egypt and Hizballah.  Imprisoned General Jamil 
El-Sayyed wrote about this conflict, noting that a similar incident 
took place between Hizballah and Jordan a few years ago, but it was 
resolved by the late Rafiq Hariri and was kept out of the media. 
 
Several editorialists seemed to have met with a senior French 
diplomatic source who said that France will not change its policy 
towards Lebanon if the opposition wins the parliamentary majority, 
and will continue to provide the Lebanese Army with training and 
weapons.

is rejecting negotiations with Arab governments.  ...It is believed 
that President Obama will not allow the Netanyahu Government to get 
away with its positions, particularly if he finds out after meeting 
Netanyahu at the White House next month that he is sticking to the 
positions that were announced by his Foreign Minister.  ...Sources

about the French position if the opposition wins in the upcoming 
elections.  He said that 'Hizballah is part of the opposition and 
not the whole opposition.  The relationship between France and 
Lebanon is a relationship between two countries and will continue to 
be that way.  It will not change.  ...Paris will implement the
