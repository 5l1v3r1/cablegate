¶1. (U) Summary:  Canada is giving C$2.67 million to assist 
flood-affected people in the Horn of Africa.  International 
Cooperation Minister Verner said that hundreds of thousands 
of children and adults will receive food, safe drinking 
water, and shelter as a result of the GoC contribution.  The 
money is being distributed through international agencies and 
Canadian NGOs to people in Kenya (C$720,000), Somalia (C$1.35 
million) and Ethiopia (C$598,800).  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On December 11, Canadian International Cooperation 
Minister Josee Verner announced that Canada is allocating 
C$2.67 million ($2.3 million) to help flood-affected people 
in the Horn of Africa.  Heavy rains in recent months have 
turned large areas of Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia into flood 
disaster zones, resulting in loss of life, and the massive 
displacement of people who have lost their homes, livelihood, 
and possessions.  According to the Canadian International 
Cooperation Agency, more than 1.6 million people have been 
affected.  Outbreaks of cholera have been detected, and 
relief agencies expect an increase in the incidence of 
malaria. 
 
¶3. (U) Minister Verner said that Canada's support will help 
victims of the flooding by providing trusted humanitarian aid 
partners with the resources they need to respond quickly and 
effectively, adding that hundreds of thousands of children 
and adults will receive food, safe drinking water and other 
provisions such as shelter kits and mosquito bed nets as a 
result of Canada's aid. 
 
¶4. (U) The new Canadian aid will be distributed to Kenya, 
Ethiopia and Somalia: 
 
Kenya (C$720,000): 
 
-- C$400,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross 
and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) for the provision of seed 
and farm implements, access to clean water and sanitation, 
and to monitor and evaluate the state of the flooding; 
 
-- C$120,000 to World Vision Canada to reduce the likelihood 
of epidemic outbreaks like malaria and cholera through the 
distribution of drug treatment kits; 
 
-- C$200,000 to Save the Children Canada to provide about 
64,000 children with non-food items such as hygiene kits and 
clothing. 
 
Somalia (C$1.35 million): 
 
-- C$400,000 to CARE Canada to assist about 50,000 
flood-affected people in southern Somalia with emergency aid 
in the coming six months; 
 
-- C$300,000 to the World Food Program to provide logistical 
air support to UN and non-governmental agencies to facilitate 
relief operations; 
 
-- C$250,000 to the World Health Organization for its work in 
assessing health infrastructure as well as support health 
clinics which distribute drugs and medical supplies; 
 
-- C$400,000 to UNICEF to supply safe drinking water as well 
as hygiene and sanitation service to the affected population. 
 
Ethiopia (C$598,800): 
 
-- C$290,000 to the IFRC to provide non-food items, 
rehabilitate the water supply systems and increase awareness 
of hygiene related issues among the displaced people; 
 
-- C$200,000 to Oxfam Canada to provide household items and 
improve access to safe drinking water to about 1,370 
households; 
 
-- C$106,800 to Save the Children Canada for the provision of 
items such as shelter materials, cooking utensils, blankets 
and seeds for over 1,000 households.
