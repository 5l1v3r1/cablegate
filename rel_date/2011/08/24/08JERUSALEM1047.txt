U.N TROOPS IN GAZA; A WEST BANK TRUCE? 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Dailies lead with news on the first day of a truce between Hamas and 
Israel.  Al-Ayyam reports, "the truce survived its first day. 
Israeli tanks stand idle on the Gaza borders."  The paper runs 
photos of Israeli soldiers and members of the Hamas Executive Forces 
relaxing on their respective sides of the Gaza line.  All dailies 
express caution in their predictions of how long the truce will 
last.  The dailies highlight that if the truce lasts long enough, 
the deployment of U.N. forces in Gaza may be possible.  The papers 
quote Israeli Premier Olmert stating that the truce is the last 
chance for Hamas to avoid an Israeli military attack on the Gaza 
Strip.  All dailies report that one Palestinian fighter was killed 
and two injured in an Israeli air strike that took place just before 
the start of the ceasefire. 
 
Coverage also highlights official Palestinian reaction to the 
Hamas/Israel truce.  Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad considers the 
truce to be a, "very important step towards improving the 
humanitarian situation in Gaza," according to the dailies.  Fayyad 
also criticizes, "ongoing settlement activities in the West Bank," 
and calls for the truce to be expanded to the West Bank.  Related 
reports in all papers highlight that Palestinian President Abbas 
welcomed the truce. 
 
All dailies express outrage over the burning by Israeli settlers of 
Palestinian olive trees and wheat fields near the West Bank city of 
Nablus on June 19.  Front page photos in all papers show the burning 
landscape.  Jamal Al Muhaysin, Governor of Nablus, comments that 
settlers are, "like a cancer in the West Bank," and alerted press 
that Israeli Defense Forces denied access to civil defense firemen, 
causing the fire to spread. 
 
All dailies report that Hamas and Israel will begin indirect 
negotiations on June 24 regarding a prisoners' exchange agreement 
that Israeli Defense Minister Barak says will require Israel to 
make, "difficult decisions."  In related coverage, the dailies 
highlight outrage expressed by the father of captured Israeli 
soldier Shalit.  The father accuses Israeli Premier Olmert and 
Israeli officials of having, 'forsaken' his son who has been held 
captive in Gaza since June 2006. 
 
Ongoing meetings between Fatah and Hamas officials aimed at 
reconciliation attract front page coverage in the dailies.  The 
dailies reprt that a Palestinian presidential delegation met ith 
national activists including governors, mayos, community and 
religious leaders in an attemptto boost reconciliation efforts. 
However, the daiies also highlight disappointment by Hamas leader 
Haniyyah over the delegation's failure to meet wih him and other 
members of his Hamas "government" as previously planned.  Haniyyah 
described the failure as, "irresponsible behavior" by the Fatah 
leaders and indicates that reconciliation is not their true 
objective. 
 
Palestinian President Abbas' June 19 meeting with Yemeni President 
Salih is front page news.  Abbas briefed Salih on current 
developments in the Palestinian Territory and the truce agreement in 
the Gaza Strip, papers note.  Abbas also briefed Salih on the 
results of his recent visit to the United States and his meeting 
with Israeli Premier Olmert and progress on the peace process, 
papers continue.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
¶1.  Al-Quds prints its daily editorial entitled, "What comes next, 
after the first day of the truce! (6/20): "Finally, a truce was 
agreed upon and it has cautiously entered its first day.  Everyone 
is watching, with many differing expectations.  Hamas officials, one 
after the other, confirm their commitment to the truce and all its 
details.  They also describe it as a victory for the Palestinian 
people.  On the Israeli side, they assure, with great caution, their 
commitment to the truce while they continue preparations for a 
comprehensive military operation [into Gaza should the truce 
fail]... in any case, the truce is a positive and needed step, and 
it is one thing that the Palestinian Authority has always called 
for.  It was the first supporter of it and called upon all parties 
to commit to it.  The positive position of the Palestinian Authority 
regarding the truce is [clear].  But there are many questions... 
[that remain] after the first day of the truce.  The big question is 
how long the truce will last, for one month or two?  Or will it be 
on-going and develop into something bigger than merely a truce 
between Hamas and Israel?  The second big question is what influence 
the truce will have on the national Palestinian dialogue that 
President Abbas has called for.  Is it going to make Hamas more 
extreme in terms of its demands, or will it become a meeting point 
for all Palestinian parties?  The coming days will provide some of 
the answers.  Everyone is watching and hoping that all of this will 
result in real and positive outcomes." 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed by columnist Muhammad 
Yaghi entitled, "The implications of the cease-fire in Gaza" (6/20): 
 "Hamas is trying to maintain its grip on Gaza through the 
accomplishment of the truce.  It is a truce that Hamas sees as a way 
to lift the siege, while Israel sees it as a way to somewhat ease 
restrictions on fuel and goods, and on [people's] movement through 
some of the crossings... This agreement seems to have further 
implications.  Let us assume that it... was also agreed upon by all 
other Palestinian parties [in Gaza]; then Hamas should honor its 
commitment to the truce, if the Israelis [do]... and prevent small 
and bigger groups... from breaking it.  In this way,...it may even 
provide a positive opening for the development of a new and real 
relationship between Fatah and Hamas that can end internal 
Palestinian division and unite the two parts of the nation."
