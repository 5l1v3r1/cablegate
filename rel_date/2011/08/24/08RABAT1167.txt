¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  As previewed during the delivery of the 
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) scorecard for Morocco 
for 2009 (Ref A), Secretary General to the Prime Minister 
Mohamed Hajoui provided to the Ambassador a copy of Prime 
Minister Abbas El Fassi's December 12 letter to Ambassador 
John Danilovich, MCC Chief Executive Officer, responding to 
the scorecard.  The letter notes areas of development in 
which the Government of Morocco (GOM) believes the scorecard 
does not adequately credit progress, and highlights Morocco's 
efforts at reform and development.  The MCC country office 
has sent the original letter to Ambassador Danilovich; 
Embassy will forward a copy of the letter by pouch to 
NEA/MAG.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Prime Minister's letter to Ambassador 
Danilovich welcomes the MCC's assistance with Morocco's 
development and calls attention to Morocco's progress in 
areas despite the corresponding "negatively affected" 
indicators.  The Prime Minister advanced examples of 
Morocco's commitment to political inclusion and respect of 
human rights, including the recent adoption of laws on 
political parties and nationality (allowing women to transmit 
citizenship), as well as successful 2007 national and 
recently announced 2009 communal elections, in which women 
will have a reserved share of seats.  The PM also noted the 
liberalization of the broadcast sector and prospective 
adoption of a new press code, as well as GOM initiatives 
meant to preserve Morocco's diverse cultural heritage as 
indications of political reform and openness. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In the field of economic development, the Prime 
Minister pointed to Morocco's plans for modernizing industry, 
tourism, agriculture, artisanal production, and business, and 
indicated that Morocco's multiple free trade agreements and 
growth in foreign direct investment demonstrate the Kingdom's 
progress.  He also highlighted the GOM's budget surplus for 
2007, healthy tax collections, and ongoing projects to reduce 
and reform corporate, income, and value-added taxes.  In the 
areas with the lowest rankings, Health Expenditures and 
Girls' Education, the Prime Minister noted progress in public 
vaccination campaigns and providing rural health care, and 
stressed that current GOM efforts in educational reform are 
targeted at rural girls. 
 
¶4.  (U) The Prime Minister's letter included a 32-page table 
of observations related to the scorecard indicators prepared 
by the Ministry of Economy and Finances, listing Morocco's 
efforts in each area and its future plans.  (Note: Although 
the Prime Minister's letter and the Ref A conversation refer 
to the FY2009 scorecard, the table of observations lists 
FY2008 and FY2007 rankings.  End Note.)  Embassy will forward 
the letter and attachment (in French) to the desk by pouch.
