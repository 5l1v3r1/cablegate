REF: WILSON/COM EMAIL 7/10/07 
 
Dear Colleagues, 
 
¶1. (SBU) As discussed in ref email to many of you and based 
on the widespread interest among chiefs of mission in the 
area, Mission Turkey proposes to host a Regional Energy COM 
Conference in Istanbul on September 20-22, 2007.  Its purpose 
will be to consider our Caspian energy strategy and how we 
can work most effectively together to advance US goals in 
this area. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Russia's recent energy (and energetic) diplomacy 
reinforces the need for a well-coordinated and effective US 
diplomacy on behalf of energy security in Europe, the 
development of Caspian Basin energy resources, and diverse 
and competitive infrastructure to get those resources to the 
international marketplace.  Highly productive US diplomacy on 
Caspian energy in the 1990s and first part of this decade 
primarily involved work with a limited set of producer and 
transit countries and companies.  Success in the next stages 
of our Caspian energy strategy -- especially regarding gas 
and European energy security -- requires a much broader range 
of producer, transit and consumer countries, companies and 
other players.  Coordination and collaboration with 
Washington and among US missions in Central Asia, the 
Caucasus, and various parts of Europe will be essential. 
September should be an opportune time to take stock, review 
our key requirements and perspectives, and engage with one 
another and key Washington players on a common regional 
energy agenda and plan of action. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Agenda:  EEB A/S Sullivan recently circulated to 
many of us a Caspian Energy Strategy paper, and it should 
provide a good basis and starting point for our discussions. 
Among specific agenda items are the following. 
 
-- Gas supplies and key, relevant political constraints in 
Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Central Asia and Iraq; 
what is the US doing and what should we do. 
 
-- Gas demand and the politics of consumer countries; how can 
the US shape demand and political factors to support our 
Caspian Basin strategy. 
 
-- Gas transit:  current and planned/possible pipelines, key 
political and commercial issues, transit and other framework 
agreements; US role, EU role. 
 
-- Regional cooperation on gas distribution and storage. 
 
-- Current oil supply and transit issues, including CPC, 
trans-Caspian shipping, Bosporus bypasses; US strategy. 
 
-- Russian energy acquisitions and strategy; how these relate 
to US and regional priorities; what should be our approach. 
 
-- Other factors:  commercial issues, EU role, Iran, China, 
etc.

Your suggestions on the agenda and organization of the 
discussion will be very helpful over the coming weeks as we 
put this event together. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Attendees:  This conference is intended for regional 
chiefs of mission and key Washington players.  Addressee 
posts include Caspian producer, transit and Nabucco/TGI 
countries.  We have also included key European capitals and 
Baghdad, given Iraq's potential role in support of US energy 
security and other goals.  If posts and/or Washington 
agencies have suggestions of others in the field or in the US 
who ought to be included, please advise.  We recognize that 
some chiefs of mission may be unable to attend.  Decisions on 
alternates and additional invitees will depend on the overall

more than about 30 participants.
