PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION EFFORTS 
 
REF: ANKARA 1539 
 
¶1. (U)  Turkey's president filed a petition with the 
Constitutional Court on June 18, asking the court to annul 
the constitutional amendment package that would move the 
country to direct presidential elections (reftel).  The Court 
will combine Sezer's challenge, which is based on procedural 
defects in the way parliament adopted the package, with a 
similar challenge filed earlier by main opposition Republican 
People's Party (CHP).  The two cases are under review and the 
Court is expected to hear the combined case next week.  If 
the Court annuls the package, it will eliminate the need for 
a referendum on the amendments, now slated for October. 
 
¶2. (U) Sezer also vetoed legislation that would have reduced 
from 120 to 45 days the waiting period required before 
holding a referendum on a constitutional amendment. 
Parliament adopted the change before recessing on June 3 in 
an effort to take the direct presidential election amendment 
to the people on July 22, the same day set for general 
elections. Sezer's veto effectively kills the measure.
