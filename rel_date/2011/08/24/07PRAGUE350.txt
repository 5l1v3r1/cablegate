¶1. (SBU) The Czech Ministry of Interior has announced the 
successful resettlement of three Cuban migrant families (ten 
people) from Guantanamo Bay to Prague. The migrants were 
persecuted by the Castro regime for their political and 
religious beliefs. According to local press reports, Interior 
Minister Ivan Langer said, "It is our ambition that the Czech 
Republic becomes a home for the refugees." 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to MOI official Katerina Sykorova (who 
works with the Unit for Policy, International Relations and 
Information on Countries of Origin), the migrants arrived on 
March 20. After completing asylum and border police 
procedures, they were driven to their new homes in private 
apartments near Prague. Sykorova said the migrants are 
"really excited about their new future." 
 
¶3. (SBU) The resettlement was made in response to a U.S. 
request (reftel).
