SUBJECT: France and ISTA Executive Committee 
Meeting 
 
REF: STATE 17795 
 
¶1.  Per REFTEL, FAS/Paris sent the talking points 
to Joel Lechappe, French Delegate to the 
International Seed Testing Association (ISTA), and 
discussed the points with him in a follow-up 
conversation. 
 
¶2.  Joel Lechappe said that he will be the French 
Delegate at the ISTA Executive Committee meeting 
on February 13-15, while Fabrice Marty will be the 
French Delegate at the June 25-29 ISTA Annual 
Meeting.  Both men work in the Study and Control 
Group for Planting Seeds and Varieties (GEVES). 
GEVES is the French public authority charged with 
conducting studies on planting seeds and new 
varieties requisite for their authorization, 
control, certification, and legal protection.  Mr. 
Marty is the Director of GEVES while Mr. Lechappe 
is the Director of the National Testing Unit for 
Planting Seeds, a unit within GEVES. 
 
¶3.  Mr. Lechappe insisted that according to the 
ISTA rules, the idea is to look for specific 
traits.  He said that he is open to the USG 
position but it must be technically feasible and 
capable of implementation.  He distinguished the 
technical feasibility from the general political 
position in this regard. 
 
¶4.  FAS/Paris also sent the talking points to the 
Ministry of Finance and Industry's Fraud Control 
Office (DGCCRF).  DGCCRF responded that while they 
implement ISTA rules they do not participate in 
their negotiations.
