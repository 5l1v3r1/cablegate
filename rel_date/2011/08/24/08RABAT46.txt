SUBJECT: OPIC-SUPPORT EURO MENA FUND II 
 
REF: STATE 01759 
 
¶1.  (U) OPIC support for the EURO MENA Fund II would mesh 
with Moroccan efforts to build a diversified and strong 
private sector and to strengthen and deepen the country's 
financial markets.  The GOM has targeted a number of areas 
through specific sectoral policies.  While most of these are 
outside the fund's planned target sectors, there is some 
overlap in the area of food, as agro-industry is targeted by 
the "Emergence" industrial program.  Education is also a 
growing sector following an accord-cadre between the Moroccan 
government and private school operators last year, and in the 
longer term the pharmaceutical sector is also a government 
target. 
 
¶2. (U) Post notes that Moroccan markets have performed very 
strongly in recent years, with strong inflows for both direct 
and equity investment.  Funding for projects in these areas 
is thus available from other sources.
