SUBJECT: IRAN/TURKMENISTAN: IRAN,S AMBASSADOR ON THE EVE OF 
BERDIMUHAMEDOV'S VISIT TO TEHERAN 
 
¶1. (U) The Russian-language "Neytralniy Turkmenistan" 
published an interview on February 11 with Iran's Ambassador 
to Turkmenistan, Mohammad-Reza Forqani. The interview focused 
almost exclusively on economic and trade topics, avoiding 
anything even remotely controversial such as the Iranian 
nuclear issue, relations with the United States or even the 
price Iran most recently agreed to pay Turkmenistan for 
natural gas. 
 
DETAILS OF THE VISIT: EVEN SKETCHIER THAN USUAL 
 
¶2. (SBU) President Berdimuhamedov was reported to be 
traveling to Iran on February 13 for an "official visit," 
although the press reports this week have offered next to no 
details about the nature of the visit.  (NOTE: A Turkish 
diplomat told us this week that an Iranian Embassy contact 
confirmed to him at the Iranian national day reception that 
Berdimuhamedov would meet with Iranian President Ahmadinejad. 
END NOTE.) 
 
IRAN'S "ECONOMIC SUCCESSES" EMPHASIZED 
 
¶3. (U) Ambassador Forqani highlighted what he termed Iran's 
"economic successes," noting the GNP of 324 billion USD in 
2008, and 126 billion USD in foreign trade.  He also said 
that the Government's economic priorities are to "raise the 
standard of living and improve the social welfare (of 
Iranians)."  He went on to note that 55% of the 2.4 million 
students at universities and other institutions of higher 
learning in Iran are women.  He went on to say that the 
country's literacy rate has gone from 39% in 1979 to 92% in 
¶2008.  When asked about his country's foreign policy goals, 
Ambassador Forqani described them as "justice, peace, and the 
development of a mutually beneficial relationship with all of 
the countries of the world," especially Iran's neighbors. 
 
SOCIO-CULTURAL TIES WITH TURKMENISTAN 
 
¶4. (U) As is customary, Ambassador Forqani focused on Iran 
and Turkmenistan's "shared culture and history," listing a 
number of poets and historical figures revered in both 
countries, including Mahmud Kashgary, Aburehan Biruni, 
Alisher Anvari and others.  A number of them, he said, will 
be the topic of a series of conferences and seminars that the 
Iranian Cultural Center plans to hold in Turkmenistan, in 
addition to the "Iranian Culture Days" that the Iranian 
Embassy organizes on a regular basis. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  The Ambassador's interview was typical of 
what the Turkmen press offers on Iran:  No controversy, and 
lots of emphasis on the cultural ties between the two 
countries.  It, along with another article in the same 
newspaper February 13 that focused on trade ties with Iran, 
were all that was communicated publicly on the eve of 
Berdimuhamedov,s visit.  END COMMENT.
