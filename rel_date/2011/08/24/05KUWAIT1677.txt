¶2.  (SBU)  PolChief discussed reftel demarche with Hamad 
Al-Ahmad, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Counselor - Chief of 
Asian Affairs on April 20 and 24.  Al-Hamad reported that 
Kuwait pledged $30 million at the January 2002 Tokyo 
International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to 
Afghanistan, and approximately $135 million at the 2004 
Berlin Donors' Conference.  While Kuwait supports efforts to 
ensure that Afghanistan is a stable, democratic state, the 
latter pledge has yet to be approved by the Council of 
Ministers and it would premature to make new commitments 
before the Council acts.
