SUBJECT: More GOZ Infighting on Land Issue 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: GOZ bickering over land reform has 
intensified over the past week, pitting hardliners 
against moderates.  End summary. 
 
The Daily Herald Barrage 
------------------------ 
¶2. (SBU) Publicly, this wrangle has taken the form of 
attacks from the GOZ's daily Herald on Lands, Land Reform 
and Resettlement Minister John Nkomo.  He is gingerly 
attempting to move some settlers around and possibly 
account for multiple farm recipients.  On May 17, an 
unsigned Herald article quoted an unnamed political 
analyst, saying Nkomo actions are "tantamount to a 
reversal of the land reform program . . . and will have 
far-reaching implications."  The May 18 Herald suggested 
"not all is well with [land reform] since the splitting 
up" of the Agriculture and Lands Ministry into two 
separate bodies.  Similar reports have followed, with 
Nkomo finally denouncing these unnamed sources and 
denying he was turning back land reform or returning 
farms to whites.  Today an unsigned Herald letter-to-the- 
editor complained that Nkomo had "bedeviled" the "land 
reform program since he took over [from] Minister Joseph 
Made." 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶3. (SBU) Clearly, Information Minister Jonathan Moyo has 
thrown the weight of the official media behind 
Agriculture Minister Made, who is upset over losing the 
land reform portfolio.  Hardliners Moyo and Made may want 
to purge remaining white farmers.  As major land reform 
beneficiaries, they may also seek to scuttle any 
crackdown on multiple farm recipients.  Even with 
encouragement from Reserve Bank Governor Gideon Gono, 
Nkomo - from the minority Ndebele ethnic group - has been 
too timid to assert himself.  Hardliners recently 
prevailed over moderates in taking over Charleswood 
Estate and Kondozi farms, skirting numerous judicial 
decisions.  Should Gono eventually assert himself more 
publicly on the land issue, it may be more difficult for 
Made and Moyo to steer the process and debate.  For now, 
these hardliners seem to be coming out on top.
