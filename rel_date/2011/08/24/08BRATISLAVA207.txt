SUBJECT: MAY 21 - DAY OF SOLIDARITY WITH CUBAN PEOPLE 
 
REF: A. STATE 46997 
 
     ¶B. STATE 45792 
 
¶1. Post discussed the May 21 "Day of Solidarity with Cuba" 
with contacts from the Slovak Government, Parliament and 
NGOs. Laszlo Nagy, Chairman of Parliament's Committee for 
human rights, minorities and the status of women, will 
consider making a statement in Parliament, or proposing a 
political resolution from his committee on May 21. 
 
¶2. Although Slovakia's NGO are active in promoting democracy 
and respect for Human Rights in Cuba, no events are planned 
for May 21. Two NGOs, People in Peril and Pontis, 
co-organized a March of Solidarity with the families of Cuban 
political prisoners in March. Both organizations argued that 
organizing an event so soon after would dampen its impact, 
and post concurs with this assessment. Post will remain 
proactive in its support for events that promote democracy 
and human rights in Cuba.
