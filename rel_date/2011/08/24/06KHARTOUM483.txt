SUBJECT:  CG Juba Round-Up 
 
¶1. (SBU) AEC Visit:  Assessment and Evaluation 
Commissioner Tom Vraalsen visited Juba and met with Riek 
Machar and the GoSS Minister of Finance, among others. 
He confirmed that the Government of National Unity had 
transferred a hefty sum from petroleum revenues into GoSS 
coffers, but the GoSS remained reluctant to disclose 
publicly how much. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Discussion with the Imam:  CG Juba staff met 
with Juba Iman Ibrahim Abdullah Bashir.  Initially 
reticent, the Imam warmed up and described harassment of 
Muslims in Juba by what he described as the "urban 
underclass."  He expressed appreciation for GoSS efforts 
to combat this problem and said that he wished periodic 
meetings with CG staff to discuss specific incidents of 
intolerance against local Muslims. 
 
¶3. (U) School Days:  CG official met with David Lodu 
Modi, Headmaster of Juba Day School, who described in 
detail the challenges educators face.  Crumbling 
infrastructure, no water or electricity, and a lack of 
textbooks and science and math teachers posed the 
greatest challenges.  Teachers are paid, but only the 
equivalent of eleven U.S. cents per month; as headmaster, 
Modi pulls down 21 cents.  Half of Modi's students are 
IDPs or recent returnees, and the drop out rate is 
excessive. 
 
¶4. (U) Too Close for Comfort:  An unexploded landmine was 
reportedly discovered and removed from near the Kalolo 
Restaurant/Night Club about 400 meters from the USAID 
compound and 100 meters from the USAID office complex, 
which is still occupied by French NGO Action Against 
Hunger (ACF).  Both expatriates and senior GoSS officials 
patronize Kalolo.  The landmine was not a recent plant.
