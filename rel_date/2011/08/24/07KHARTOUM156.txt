¶1. (U) The United States seeks to dismantle Sudan, said Presidential 
Advisor Mustafa Osman Ismail, according to a January 31 account in 
the Sudan News Agency, a state-operated media outlet.  The former 
Minister of Foreign Affairs also is quoted as stating that the U.S. 
strategy towards Sudan had shifted from ousting the Sudanese 
government through neighboring countries to one of consolidating 
peace and then mounting international pressure through human rights 
organizations and bringing controversy to Khartoum. 
 
¶2. (U) Ismail's interview also stated that the relationship between 
Sudan and the EU was "slow" and influenced by U.S. strategy through 
individuals supported by the U.S. and the UK.  According to the 
government-affiliated Sudan Vision daily newspaper, in reference to 
the same interview, Ismail is quoted as stating that the U.S. and 
Israel are working to create splits and divisions among Arab 
nations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  The views of Ismail, a National Congress Party 
stalwart, reflects continuing suspicions regarding the ultimate 
objectives of non-governmental organizations and a broader, more 
international peacekeeping force in Darfur.
