     ¶B. MADRID 1923

¶1. This is an action request.  Please see para 6. 
 
¶2. Summary.  FM Moratinos reaffirmed to the Ambassador on 
July 27 that Spain will provide the requested funds to 
support construction of the Basrah Children's Hospital. 
Moratinos said Spain would provide the funds as quickly as 
possible, but could not do so before September. End Summary. 
 
¶3. Upon receipt of REF A, post immediately contacted Spanish 
officials to relay the USG's desire to effect the transfer of 
the $22 million Spanish contribution to the Basrah Children's 
Hospital as quickly as possible in order to proceed with the 
project.  On July 25, the Embassy sent REF A details of our 
suggestion that funds be transferred to the Iraq Relief and 
Reconstruction Fund (IRRF), as well as an explanation as to 
the urgency of our request to Javier Sancho, Chief of Staff 
to FM Miguel Angel Moratinos, to the office of Deputy FM 
Bernardino Leon, and to Ricardo Martinez, Director General 
for Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe at the Spanish Agency 
for International Cooperation (AECI).  Deputy FM Leon's staff 
informed the Embassy that AECI would handle the details of 
the Spanish contribution to the hospital project. 
 
¶4. The Embassy followed up with AECI on July 26, at which 
time it emerged that Spanish funds were not available for 
disbursement by September 1 to support the Basrah Children's 
Hospital.  AECI officials underscored Spain's commitment to 
provide $22 million, as indicated by FM Moratinos, but said 
it would take time to re-program funds that had already been 
allocated to other projects.  They also said that it AECI 
needed more time to determine whether transmitting funds to 
the IRRF was the correct vehicle for making the money 
available for the hospital project.  Post contacted FM 
Moratinos' office and Deputy FM Leon's staff to relay this 
information and to indicate that the Ambassador planned to 
raise the issue with FM Moratinos in a previously-scheduled 
meeting on July 27. 
 
¶5. In discussing the issue with Moratinos, the Ambassador 
stressed that the USG was grateful for Spain's generous 
contribution to the Basrah Children's Hospital and gave 
Moratinos a copy of the letter from First Lady Laura Bush 
thanking him for his support of the project (REF B). 
Moratinos noted that he had spoken with President Zapatero 
regarding Spain's contribution and that Zapatero had given 
his backing to the initiative.  However, Moratinos added that 
it would be difficult, if not impossible, for Spain to 
provide the funds by September and that it would be later in 
the year before the $22 million could be transferred.  He 
reaffirmed Spain's commitment to provide the funds as 
promised.  (NOTE: Javier Sancho, Moratinos' Chief of Staff, 
told us after the meeting that Moratinos was pushing the 
appropriate Spanish agencies to move quickly, but that the 
$22 million was simply not available at the moment). 
 
//COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST// 
 
¶6. The day after the Ambassador's meeting with Moratinos, 
negative media stories regarding the Basrah hospital project 
circulated in the international press, including one story in 
the New York Times indicating that Spain could become 
involved in supporting the project.  In order to help the 
Spanish Government deal with possible domestic 
political/media criticism as it moves forward, we request 
that all relevant programatic information regarding the 
Basrah Children's Hospital be sent to Embassy Madrid so that 
we can transmit it to the MFA.  We could send this 
information to the MFA under the cover of a note verbale, to 
include a formal request that Spain fill the $22 million 
needed for completion of the project.  This would both help 
move the project through AECI and help the Spanish Government 
answer any questions that may be raised regarding the Basrah 
Children's Hospital.
