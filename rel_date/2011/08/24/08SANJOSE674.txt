¶1. (SBU) Econoff and Poloff met with Carlos Cordero, 
Department of Disarmament, Terrorism, and Organized Crime, of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) of Costa Rica on August 
¶7.  Econoff demarched the MFA on several terrorism 
designations, consisting of both Executive Orders and UN 
designations (Reftels A-I). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cordero explained that the MFA reviews and then 
passes all designations to DIS (the Costa Rican national 
intelligence service).  For designations that are sanctioned 
by the UN, DIS will investigate the designations by engaging 
with Interpol.  For designations that are sanctioned only by 
the USG, DIS accepts the designations but does not 
investigate.  Cordero explained that an "Executive Order is a 
national mechanism; thus, (GOCR) cannot take measures on this 
basis."  Econoff suggested to Cordero that any US designation 
with affiliation to a UN designated organization should be 
included in DIS's investigations with Interpol.  Cordero said 
that he would take the matter into consideration. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Commenting on the terrorism finance bill first in 
the current queue in the National Assembly, Cordero said that 
the bill would comply with Egmont Group requirements plus 
other international terrorism standards.  Currently, the bill 
is in the Committee for Narcotrafficking, chaired by 
Frederico Tinoco (PLN).  It was approved unanimously in the 
committee and now awaits plenary debate.  The bill targets 
three areas of the existing criminal code:  financing, 
recruiting, and inciting terrorist acts.  Most importantly, 
the bill will fix a gaping hole in the current legal code by 
establishing penalties for acts of terrorism.  (The FARC 
financing case which developed in March following the 
Colombian raid on Raul Reyes's camp in Ecuador, for example, 
is not actionable in Costa Rica under current law, since 
terrorism financing per se is not a crime) With a finish to 
the CAFTA implementation legislation on the near horizon, the 
bill needs to move forward as Costa Rica is now in "extension 
status" with the Egmont Group.
