¶1. (SBU) GUIDANCE REQUEST: Mission requests Washington 
approval to circulate the revised Food-for-Thought paper in 
para 4.  The revision reflects USDEL discussions per earlier 
guidance (ref A) and the visit of the Chairman of the 1540 
Committee to the OSCE (ref B).  See also para 3 on concerns 
raised by Moscow representative who discussed broader UNSCR 
1540 issues with ISN/CPI Director Tony Foley, U.S. 1540 
Coordinator Tom Wuchte, and UNVIE Senior Political Officer 
Stefanie Amadeo.  Washington guidance is welcome before 
beginning of 2009 winter session in mid-January. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) This revised FFT reflects bilateral consultations 
with OSCE delegations from UK and France, as well as the 
incoming Chairman-in-Office (CiO), Greece.  Greece deferred 
to others, but offered to support as needed once the UK and 
French delegations determined how to incorporate this 
suggested approach into the 2009 Forum for Security 
Cooperation (FSC) chairmanships that include France, Georgia, 
and the UK.  All three delegations, as well as Russia (see 
para 5 below) need further details on next steps and want to 
see a concrete paper. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The text below reflects these discussions and 
clarifies further that the recommended approach would (a) 
complement the 1540 Committee and be consistent with its 
mandate, but (b) not determine where the locus of activity 
should occur, i.e., the Permanent Council's Security 
Committee or the FSC. NOTE:  It was clear from these 
consultations that the U.S. should strive for co-sponsorship 
by, at minimum, the UK and France who as P3 Security Council 
members agree on this regional approach.  END NOTE. 
 
Food-for-Thought Text 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Begin text: 
 
Draft Cover Note from U.S. delegation ) for introduction at 
the OSCE Permanent Council Security Committee and Forum for 
Security Cooperation: 
 
The UNSCR 1540 Committee's report outlining efforts since 
2006 was completed in July 2008 and notes that OSCE efforts 
to complement UN activities in this field are welcome and 
that institutional relationships are important.  To further 
promote implementation of UNSCR 1540 by OSCE participating 
States, the co-sponsors recommend that the OSCE consider 
broadening responsibility for the cross-dimensional aspects 
to include the Permanent Council's Security Committee, in 
addition to the Forum for Security Cooperation (FSC).  Both 
the FSC and the Security Committee offer a broader base for a 
cross-dimensional strategy, including the OSCE's Action 
against Terrorism Unit (ATU) and Borders Group, to further 
the 1540 Committee's nonproliferation agenda as part of the 
overall United Nations Counter-Terrorism Strategy. 
 
In addition, this paper urges both groups to make 2009 a year 
 
USOSCE 00000318  002 OF 004 
 
 
where the nexus between WMD proliferation and terrorism is 
discussed with the same frequency and detail as issues such 
as small arms and light weapons.  This approach would allow 
the OSCE to continue serving as a "regional organization" 
leader and model for other international organizations. 
 
The co-sponsors request that the attached document "OSCE 
UNSCR 1540 Strategy Paper" be added to the agenda of the next 
joint FSC/PC meeting.  The paper would serve as the basis for 
discussion on next steps within the OSCE.  The paper offers 
an outline for a comprehensive regional approach designed to 
increase cooperation between the Security Committee and FSC. 
This approach is consistent with the OSCE Ministerial 
Statements already addressing resolution 1540, as well as 
ongoing efforts in the IAEA and UNODC.  Delegations are 
thanked in advance for their consideration of this proposal 
addressing an important threat to 21 st century security. 
 
OSCE UNSCR 1540 Strategy Paper 
 
Vienna Intergovernmental Organizations (IGO's) should create 
a geographic center of excellence by leveraging institutional 
capacity already in place to support the full implementation 
of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540.  The 1540 
Committee (hereinafter the "Committee") has stressed the 
importance of regional implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) in 
resolutions 1673 (2006) and 1810 (2008) and welcomes the 
opportunity to strengthen its dialogue with the OSCE, UNODC, 
and IAEA. 
 
It is our view that the Vienna IGO's efforts to promote 
implementation of 1540 can complement and multiply overall 
efforts and would include leading by example within the OSCE. 
 A comprehensive regional approach can increase cooperation 
between the Committee, consistent with the OSCE Ministerial 
Statements already addressing resolution 1540, the 
Committee's letter dated December 17, 2007 to the OSCE, and 
the recent briefing at the OSCE by the Committee Chairman on 
December 10. 
 
In accordance with the new mandate under Security Council 
resolution 1810 (2008), activities to facilitate the delivery 
to states of needed technical assistance will be a high 
priority for the Committee.  The OSCE in cooperation with 
IAEA and UNODC can help improve states' capacity to implement 
1540 through regular consultations and outreach 
In 2009, the OSCE participating States (pS) have three 
immediate priorities that will further regional 
implementation: 
 
¶I.  The Committee agreed in paragraph 4 of resolution 1810, 
to "encourage all States to prepare on a voluntary basis 
summary implementation plans, with the assistance of the 1540 
Committee as appropriate, mapping out their priorities and 
plans for implementing the key provisions of resolution 1540 
(2004), and to submit those plans to the 1540 Committee." 
The OSCE Ministerial Statements provide support for stronger 
coordination and follow up through a comprehensive 
information exchange in cooperation with other Vienna IGO's 
as a next step.  At 56, the effect of regionally exchanging 
data on all the reports and matrices, discussing it among the 
pS and Partners for Cooperation, and forwarding it as the 
OSCE contribution will greatly complement the efforts of the 
 
USOSCE 00000318  003 OF 004 
 
 
Committee in New York. 
 
II.  Consistent with paragraph 5 of resolution 1810, which 
"urges States ... to inform the Committee as appropriate of 
areas in which they are able to provide assistance," the 
Committee would welcome any new information OSCE pS, as well 
as the Partners for Cooperation, could provide on their 
technical assistance programs.  The Committee could post such 
information in the technical assistance portion of its 
website (http://www.un.org/sc/1540/).  The OSCE could also 
draw the attention of pS to the Committee's technical 
assistance template, also posted on the Committee's website. 
 
III.  Consistent with paragraph 2 of resolution 1810, which 
calls on States to submit reports of implementation efforts, 
the Committee requests the OSCE continue to  promote pS 
reporting on implementation, and help promote their 
implementation of resolution 1540.  The OSCE could consider 
shifting to a broader, Vienna-based cross-dimensional 
strategy centered on either the Security Committee, which 
provides oversight to the Action against Terrorism Unit (ATU) 
and Borders Group that complement the 1540 Committee's 
nonproliferation agenda as part of the United Nations 
Counter-Terrorism Strategy, or in the FSC  with increased 
dialogue with the Security Committee.  That strategy could 
include, inter alia: 
 
-- OSCE Field Missions that could assist pS in a number of 
practical programmatic areas. 
 
-- OSCE cooperation with partner organizations, such as IAEA, 
UNDOC, NATO, OPCW, INTERPOL, etc. to host more frequent UNSCR 
1540 dialogue. 
 
-- Hosting regional 1540 implementation technical assistance 
and training workshops at the OSCE Academy in Central Asia.

A Moscow View 
------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) On the margins, Wuchte and Foley, accompanied by 
UNVIE political officer met with Moscow Senior Counselor 
Deyneko who has been working UNSCR 1540 issues and attended 
the FSC meeting December 10 (see Ref B).  Wuchte and Foley 
welcomed the participation of the expert from Russia's 
capital, although he did not intervene at the plenary or at 
the Finnish-hosted small group discussion with the 1540 
Committee Chair immediately after. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Deyneko expressed his skepticism that regional 
organizations could provide any real value-added to the work 
of the 1540 Committee.  He acknowledged that although he was 
not familiar with OSCE competencies, he remained concerned 
that the approach recommended by the Committee led to 
"unnecessary layers" and "diminishment" of the role of the 
Committee.  Wuchte and Foley pointed out that this was wholly 
consistent with the operative paragraphs in UNSCR 1810, which 
also extended the Committee until 2011.  Deyneko said he was 
aware of this but Moscow was still not happy with the outcome 
of the renewal resolution or the Committee's report.

¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: Mission encourages Washington and New York 
to engage quickly in aligning Moscow's co-sponsorship of 
UNSCR 1810 with a corresponding commitment to support the 
regional and intergovernmental strategy well under way as 
proposed in para 2 above.  END COMMENT.
