Sensitive but Unclassified 
 
¶1. (SBU) The following is a short update on the current status of 
some of the most high-profile USG energy projects in Afghanistan: 
 
¶2. (SBU) 100 MW KABUL POWER PLANT "GEN SETS" - Despite earlier 
problems with squatters on the project site, site clearing is 
underway.  Topographical and aerial survey mapping have been 
completed as well as site cleaning and the project appears to be on 
schedule for completion with 66 MW coming on line in December 2008 
and the remaining 34 MW in early April 2009. 
 
¶3. (SBU) North East Power System (NEPS) - UZBEKISTAN - As reported 
in Reftel, the Afghans have agreed to fund the construction of 43 km 
of power lines and power transformer (500/220 KV - 500 MVA) within 
Uzbekistan in order to complete the interconnection with the NEPS 
system.  Deputy Minster of Energy and Water Mir Sediq will lead a 
delegation to Uzbekistan on January 4 to complete construction 
contract and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) negotiations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) NEPS - TAJIKISTAN - Although it has previously said no work 
on the Tajik line of the NEPS would begin until a PPA was 
negotiated, the Asian Development Bank released tender documents for 
the Kunduz to Tajik border transmission line in early December. 
This step was taken in the hopes that Afghanistan will conclude a 
PPA with the Tajiks by March or April of 2008.  This will coincide 
with the expected contract award deadline for the construction of 
the line and will allow work to begin immediately.  If a PPA is not 
in place by April 2008, the ADB will delay the project award. 
 
¶5. (SBU) NEPS - TURKMENISTAN - In discussions with the Ministry of 
Energy and Water, the Turkmen have requested a demonstration of 
Afghan commitment to the NEPS.  They would like to see Afghanistan 
begin construction of the 40 km of transmission line needed in 
Afghanistan to connect with Turkmenistan.  In turn, Turkmenistan 
will then begin construction of its 400 km of transmission line 
necessary to export power into the NEPS system.  Discussions are 
underway to identify funding for the Afghan portion of the NEPS line 
to Turkmenistan. 
 
¶6. (SBU) South East Power System (SEPS) - Security problems persist, 
however, an airlift to transport materials for the rehabilitations 
of Unit #3 to the site is expected to take place in early January. 
The planned rehabilitation would take Unit # 3, currently generating 
approximately 11 MW, off-line for nine months.  Discussions are 
underway to explore the possibility of providing temporary gensets 
to the areas affected by the shutdown of Unit #3 in the interim. 
 
¶7. (SBU) SHEBERGHAN GAS WELL REHABILITATION - A joint Ministry of 
Mines, Louis Berger Group and USAID team completed their analysis of 
the bids.  The USAID contracting office hopes to have the contract 
awarded by mid-January allowing the contractor to mobilize into the 
field by the end of January 2008.  Preliminary well test results 
should be available by June 2008. 
 
¶8. (SBU) SHEBERGHAN POWER GENERATION - USAID is exploring two 
simultaneous approaches to power generation, i.e., a fast-track 
approach that would procure gas turbine generators for public sector 
management, and a necessarily longer-term effort to attract private 
sector investment in larger-scale generating capacity, assuming that 
the above-mentioned well test results prove sufficiently positive.
