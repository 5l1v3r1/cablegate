Secretary of State Clinton's First Visit to China 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. At the regularly-scheduled February 24 MFA press briefing, new 
MFA spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said Secretary Clinton's first visit to 
China from February 20-22 achieved "positive results" and the two 
sides reaffirmed their desire to "maintain their close dialogue." 
Secretary Clinton had "in-depth exchanges" on a "broad range of 
issues" in meetings with President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao, 
State Councilor Dai Bingguo, and FM Yang Jiechi.  Ma stated that 
China and the United States will expand areas of common interest in 
this "new era." 
 
Possible DPRK Missile Launch 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. In answer to a question on a possible future North Korean missile 
launch, Ma said China "takes note" of the matter and hopes relevant 
parties will maintain "peace and stability" on the Peninsula, which 
is in the "common interest of all parties." 
 
Defense Relations with the United States 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Ma said China "attaches importance" to its cooperation with the 
United States on defense-related issues.  The PRC will work with the 
United States to strengthen exchanges and promote bilateral ties in 
this area. 
 
Tibet, Rumored New Year Boycott, Travel Ban 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. Ma said Tibet enjoys "social stability" and "economic growth," 
and Tibetans have a "good life."  People there are celebrating the 
Tibetan New Year, he continued.  Any rumors from the "Dalai clique" 
of a New Year boycott are aimed at "destroying stability" in Tibet 
and are "doomed to failure."  As for a ban on journalists traveling 
to Tibet, Ma stated that the "Open Tibet" policy has not changed. 
Interested travelers are welcome to apply through "normal 
channels." 
 
Zardari's Recent Visit, India-Pakistan 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Ma noted that Pakistani President Zardari visited Hubei and 
Shanghai from February 20-24.  He met with State Councilor Dai 
Bingguo in Wuhan, visited the Three Gorges Dam, and met with 
financial, agricultural, and water conservation experts.  Ma 
underscored that Pakistan and India are both important neighbors, 
and he urged both sides to "properly handle" issues of concern. 
"Stability" and "peaceful" interaction are in the interest of both 
countries and in the common interest of the international community, 
the spokesperson said. 
 
Auction of Chinese Relics in France 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Chinese cultural relics being auctioned off in France should be 
returned to China to protect the country's cultural heritage, said 
Ma.  The auction of these items "offends the Chinese people," and 
China has expressed its strong opposition to their sale.  In 
response to reported comments from the artifacts' owner that he 
would give the items to China if the Chinese Government observed 
human rights, the spokesperson countered that to "infringe on 
cultural rights" under the "pretext of human rights" is 
"ridiculous." 
 
Russian Sinking of Chinese Cargo Ship 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. China has expressed "grave concern" to Russia over the Russian

Navy's sinking of the Chinese cargo ship New Star and is taking the 
matter "seriously," Ma said.  Russia has conveyed regret and 
condolences and has promised to investigate and report the results 
to China. 
 
ASEAN Summit in Bangkok 
----------------------- 
 
¶9. Questioned about the upcoming ASEAN summit in Bangkok, Ma 
reaffirmed China "attaches great importance" to the organization. 
The appointment of a PRC Ambassador to ASEAN in late 2008 is a 
testament to China's desire to "promote friendly exchanges." 
 
Visits of ROK, Japanese, and Swedish FMs 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶10. South Korean FM Yu Myung-hwan is in Beijing at the invitation of 
FM Yang from February 24-25 for talks on bilateral relations and 
issues of "common interest."  Japanese FM Hirofumi Nakasone will 
visit China from February 29-March 1, and Swedish FM Carl Bildt will 
visit the country from March 1-3.  During Bildt's visit, China and 
Sweden will discuss both bilateral relations and Sino-EU relations, 
since Sweden will take over the EU presidency later this year.
