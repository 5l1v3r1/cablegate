SUBJECT: PALESTINIAN ACCESS TO EAST JERUSALEM HOSPITALS 
RESTRICTED BY GOI 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  A new GOI access restriction for 
Palestinian hospital staff has severely disrupted the 
operations of the six Palestinian East Jerusalem hospitals, 
according to Hospital Network Coordinator Tawfiq Nasser.  He 
said that patients and staff are now restricted to two 
specific checkpoints, resulting in daily travel delays of 
90-120 minutes.  Palestinian employees of Israeli hospitals 
in Jerusalem are not subject to this rule and use other, more 
efficient checkpoints.  The GOI is scheduled to meet 
internally about this issue on November 30, according to 
Nasser, who underscored the magnitude of the problem:  "We 
cannot go on like this."  PA Ministry of Health officials 
expressed to Econoff their concern over this issue.  End 
summary. 
 
Patients and staff directed to crowded checkpoints 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Tawfiq Nasser, CEO of Augusta Victoria Hospital in 
East Jerusalem, told Econoff on November 19 that a new GOI 
policy implemented in early October requires patients and 
employees of Palestinian East Jerusalem hospitals to enter 
Jerusalem from the north only via the Qualandia and Olive 
checkpoints.  The Qualandia and Olive checkpoints are crowded 
and not convenient for all travelers.  Nasser said that GOI 
contacts had noted in July possible changes to Israeli 
policies for commuting Palestinians entering Jerusalem, but 
no new regulation was specified.  PA Ministry of Health 
officials told Econoff on November 16 that the new 
restrictions have greatly limited hospital services. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Nasser said that individuals had previously been 
allowed to use less crowded, "easier" checkpoints, including 
Hizma.  Palestinians working for NGOs, the UN, and consulates 
can still use these "easier" checkpoints, as well as those 
working at Israeli hospitals in Jerusalem. 
 
Daily delays greatly hinder hospital services 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Nasser said that, as a result of this change, 
hospital services have been greatly restricted in recent 
weeks, given the unpredictable arrivals of patients, 
physicians, nurses, and technicians.  Prior to this change, 
employees had commutes of 30-45 minutes from Ramallah.  Those 
travel times are now 90-120 minutes each day.  Nasser told 
Econoff that 75 percent of his West Bank staff are directly 
affected by these new restrictions.  He underscored that 
hospital services and operations are being delayed and 
canceled due to late arrivals: "We cannot go on like this," 
he said. 
 
Israeli officials to meet November 30; 
Blair Team has raised with GOI 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Nasser has written to numerous officials in the PA 
and GOI to request assistance.  He said that Israeli Ministry 
of Health, police, and COGAT officials planned to meet on the 
issue on November 30.  Members of the Blair Team told Econoff 
that they have raised this matter with the GOI in recent 
weeks.
