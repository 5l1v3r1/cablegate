¶1.  (SBU) Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor 
Tsogtbaatar, on his own initiative, met with DCM and 
 
SIPDIS 
Ppoloff to brief on Mongolia's position at the 
forthcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) 
summit in Shanghai.  Tsogtbaatar said President 
Enkhbayar would depart on June 14 for the summit, but 
would spend the minimum amount of time there because of 
the need to return for the visit of Dutch Crown Prince. 
He said Enkhbayar would have time only for bilaterals 
with Presidents Putin, Hu Jintao, and Nazarbayev. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Tsogtbaatar said Enkhbayar would use his 
five5-minute speaking opportunity to describe 
Mongolia's desire to establish a nuclear free zone, and 
describe the dangers of proliferation of WMD and of 
violations of the NPT.  Enkhbayar will not use the 
words "Iran" or "North Korea," but it will be clear 
that his words are directed at their nuclear quests, 
Tsogtbaatar said.

¶3.  (SBU) DCM noted our desire to avoid a repetition of 
last year's SCO resolution aimed at the Coalition 
military presence in Central Asia.  Tsogtbaatar replied 
that Mongolia had not picked up indications of such a 
resolution.  Tsogtbaatar opined that Mongolia sees SCO 
issues mostly as does the U.S.  However, he said, 
Mongolia sometimes need to consider how it reflects 
these views.  Mongolia has no desire to become an SCO 
member, he said, and wants to be careful not to give 
any basis for appeals to become a member, given its 
apparent interest in security issues.  Mongolia's main 
interest in the SCO would remain economic, he added. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Tsogtbaatar said Mongolia would complain at 
the summit about the level of information given to 
observers, which it found insufficient and not really 
aided by the recent SCO moves to more clearly define 
the status of "members" and "observers."  While 
Mongolia could often find out relevant information from 
members, "observer" should entail some better level of 
information than for SCO nonparticipants, he said. 
The SCO should not be allowed to just cite the growing 
number of observers as evidence of SCO's success; there 
had to be some meaning to observer status.  Tsogtbaatar 
commented that requests to the SCO Secretariat in 
Beijing for information too often are rebuffed with the 
statement that the staff is unsure whether this 
information is releasable to observers.  He opined 
that, to some extent, such replies reflect genuine 
staff confusion in the Secretariat, but said they also 
can involve subtle SCO pressure on Mongolia and others 
to become members. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Tsogtbaatar averred that there is pressure on 
Mongolia by Russia to become a member over the long- 
term, with appeals sometimes funneled through Central 
Asian states.  There is also pressure from China, he 
said, but more indirect.  Tsogtbaatar commented that 
Mongolia was reassured during the recent visit of the 
Indian Foreign Secretary to hear that India also had no 
interest in becoming a member, since this would help 
avoid a sense of momentum for observer-to-member 
conversions.
