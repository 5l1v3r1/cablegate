¶1. (U) This report is a general overview of the Maronite 
community in Lebanon, to provide a brief understanding on who 
the Maronites are, how the Maronite clergy is structured, and 
what the responsibilities are of the clergy in Lebanon.  A 
subsequent report will cover the succession to the Patriarch 
and a more in-depth look at the current head of the Maronite 
church.  EmbOffs spoke to Bishop Bishara Rai from Jbeil and 
Carol Dagher, expert on Maronite affairs and representative 
in the General Assembly Synod. 
 
WHO ARE THE MARONITES? 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Maronites are Christians who belong to the Eastern 
Catholic Churches, a group of Churches that are autonomous 
yet in full communion with the Holy See, and which recognize 
the central role of the Pope within the College of Bishops. 
The Maronite history extends back to the early fifth century, 
when Saint Maroun, a Christian monk, founded the Maronite 
spiritual movement. 
 
¶3. (U) There are approximately eight million Maronites 
worldwide, over one million of whom live in Lebanon.  There 
are large Maronite communities in Brazil (estimated five and 
a half million), the U.S. (three million), Argentina 
(700,000), Canada (100,000), and smaller populations in other 
countries including Australia, Syria, Liberia, Israel, and 
Cyprus.  While its percentage of the total population in 
Lebanon is waning (possibly at 25 percent today), the 
absolute majority of total Lebanese worldwide are Maronite. 
 
STRUCTURE OF MARONITE CLERGY 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir, as the 
Patriarch, leads the Maronite community.  He was chosen as 
the Patriarch of Antioch and the Levant in 1986 after serving 
as a bishop and then as the Patriarchal vicar at Bkirki.  As 
the head of the Maronite community, the Patriarch wields 
influence in Lebanese politics and is consulted daily by a 
myriad of political figures from all confessions, who seek 
his approval or appeal to him for support.  (Note:  Cardinal 
Sfeir will travel to South Africa, the U.S., and Spain during 
the last three weeks of May.  End note.) 
 
¶5. (U) The Patriarch is one of five members who make up the 
Permanent Synod, an organization of four Bishops and the 
Patriarch which meets for one week annually.  In addition, 
there is an Archbishop Synod composed of 40 diocese 
worldwide, 12 of which are in Lebanon and organized 
gegraphically.  The "nucleus" of the Synod is the Concil of 
Bishops, made up of approximately 30 bisops worldwide. 
 
¶6. (U) The Synod coordinates the appointments of bishops with 
the Vatican.  Typically the Synod will compile and vote on a 
list of 20-30 individuals it deems worthy to become a bishop. 
 To be included on the list, the candidate must receive a 
half plus one majority of votes.  The list is then 
transmitted to Rome for approval by the Pope.  Conversely, 
the Patriarch can consult with the bishops, soliciting two to 
three names from each bishop, and then send these names to 
Rome.  Bishops are appointed to a geographic seat, though 
they do not need to be from that area.  They remain bishops 
until they reach the age of 75. 
 
¶7. (U) A larger General Assembly Synod consists of appointed 
members, such as priests and nuns, Catholic invitees, and 
observers from other confessions, in addition to the 
Patriarch, diocesan and honorary bishops.  Experts on 
relevant topics, such as education, economics, and social 
affairs, are also invited to participate in the General 
Assembly. 
 
FUNCTIONS OF THE CLERGY 
----------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) The Council of Bishops meets on the first Wednesday of 
every month.  It deals with everyday affairs, such as 
ecclesiastical, liturgical, pastoral, and national topics, 
and issues a communique, which often makes a statement on the 
current political situation. 
 
¶9. (U) The General Assembly Synod has been meeting twice 
yearly for the last three years.  A number of committees, 
composed of experts, professors, writers, are organized by

issue and are charged with presenting their research, for 
example, on education administration, during its sessions.
