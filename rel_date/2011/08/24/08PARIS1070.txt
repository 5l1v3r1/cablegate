PARIS-BASED AFRICAN MISSIONS' RESPONSES 
 
REF: STATE 56181 
 
(SBU)  In response to reftel, we received the following 
responses from Paris-based missions: 
 
--  Gambia:  Ambassador Moses Jallow said on May 28 that he 
would travel to Geneva for the June 18 election and would 
vote for Ambassador Swing.  He recalled favorably his recent 
meeting in Paris with Ambassador Swing and said "tell 
Washington that I will be there and that we will support him 
with full force." 
 
--  Guinea-Bissau:  At the request of the G-B Embassy in 
Paris, we provided on May 28 a non-paper on the IOM election, 
drawn from reftel.  Our contact said that G-B's foreign 
minister would be in Paris over the May 31-June 1 weekend and 
that the matter would be referred to the minister.  In a 
follow-up conversation on June 3, our contact at the G-B 
Embassy in Paris said that he did refer the matter to his 
minister during the latter's transit through Paris the 
previous weekend (the minister was returning from the TICAD 
meeting in Tokyo).  Our contact said that the minister told 
him that the matter would be referred to G-B's UN PermRep, 
who handles all matters involving international 
organizations.  Our contact could not say how the UN PermRep 
would coordinate voting in Geneva nor whether G-B would 
support Ambassador Swing.  He was quite effusive, however, in 
expressing G-B's desire to be helpful on this issue. 
 
--  Liberia:  After several exchanges, our contact at the 
Liberian Embassy in Paris told us on June 3 that Liberia's 
Ambassador to France would attend the meeting and would vote. 
 When asked, our contact declined to say for whom Liberia 
would vote, remarking that her Ambassador would receive his 
instructions from Monrovia, that she would not necessarily be 
privy to those instructions, and therefore was not in a 
position to say how Liberia would vote. 
 
--  Togo: Kokou Kpayedo, who handles IO issues at Togo's 
Embassy in Paris, told us on May 30 that his mission had not 
received any instructions either on how Togo would vote or on 
whether someone from his mission would travel to Geneva to 
represent Togo at the election.  He expected that someone 
from Togo would go to Geneva, but said that his Embassy could 
receive instructions "at the last minute."
