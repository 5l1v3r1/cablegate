Â¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs Officer and Russian Embassy CT 
Officer Alexander Kondakov delivered ref demarche to Holger 
Kraemer, German MFA desk officer for International CT 
cooperation, May 14.  Kraemer replied MFA Commissioner for 
Counterterrorism Ambassador Buso von Alvensleben would attend 
the event in Vienna, but he might be the only German 
representative.  Kraemer referred to the previous Russian-led 
efforts to encourage interest on the part of German firms in 
the public-private partnerships to combat terrorism.  Kraemer

instances, had not expressed interest in the event and he did 
not expect any German firms to attend.
