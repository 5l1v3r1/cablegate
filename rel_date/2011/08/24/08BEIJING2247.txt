SUBJECT: JUNE 10 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: DIAOYU ISLANDS COLLISION, 
JAPAN-DPRK TALKS, STATEMENT ON TIBET 
 
¶1.  Key points at the June 10 MFA press briefing were: 
 
-- China is gravely concerned and "strongly dissatisfied" by the 
Japanese Coast Guard's "illegal" activities near the Diaoyu 
Islands. 
 
-- China hopes the talks between the DPRK and Japan "promote the 
normalization of bilateral relations." 
 
-- The spokesperson had no comment on the reported joint U.S.-EU 
statement on dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama. 
 
Japanese Collision with Fishing Vessel 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the June 10, 2008, regular MFA press briefing, MFA Spokesman 
Qin Gang responded to a question about the collision between a 
Japanese Coast Guard vessel and a Taiwan fishing boat by saying that 
the Diaoyu Islands have been an "an inalienable part of China since 
ancient times."  Qin expressed China's grave concern and 
dissatisfaction with the Japanese Coast Guard's actions.  China 
urges Japan to stop its "illegal activity" to prevent issues like 
this from occurring in the future. 
 
Japan-DPRK Talks 
---------------- 
 
¶3. Qin said China welcomes the talks between North Korea and Japan 
which are scheduled to begin tomorrow.  China hopes the discussions 
will be "fruitful and promote the normalization of bilateral 
relations" as well as progress in the Six-Party Talks. 
 
U.S.-EU Statement on Tibet 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. Qin said he had not seen and so was unable to comment on a 
reported joint U.S.-EU statement on dialogue between China and the 
Dalai Lama.  Qin emphasized that "Tibet is an inalienable part of 
China" and that China opposes any interference in its internal 
affairs.  China is fully capable of dealing with its internal 
affairs, added Qin. 
 
Paris Tourism 
------------- 
 
¶5. Asked about reports that Beijing has initiated a tourist boycott 
of Paris, Qin responded that on principle, China believes that 
exchanges between people from different countries should increase as 
they are "helpful for enhancing understanding."  Qin said France 
should do more to encourage and attract Chinese citizens to visit 
France. 
 
VOA Website Access 
------------------ 
 
¶6. In response to a question from a Voice of America (VOA) reporter 
about the lack of full access to the VOA English website in China, 
Qin said he "does not usually read" the VOA website so he was not 
aware of the situation. 
 
Sudan VP Visit 
-------------- 
 
¶7. Qin said Sudan VP Ali Osman Taha will meet with Chinese VP Xi 
Jinping today and and Hu Jintao on June 11.  VP Taha will also visit 
Shenzhen and Shanghai. 
 
Ban Ki-moon Visit 
----------------- 
 
¶8. Qin announced that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will visit 
China July 1-3.  The details of the visit are still under 
discussion.
