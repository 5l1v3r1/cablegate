REF: STATE 18226 
 
¶1. (SBU) Polcouns delivered reftel demarche February 25 to 
Jamal Al-Shamayleh, director of the Foreign Minister's 
private office.  Shamayleh was not aware of the issue, but 
after a quick phone call to the Jordanian parliament's 
Secretary General, confirmed that Jordan's parliament was 
 
SIPDIS 
planning to send a delegation to attend the Arab 
Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting in Erbil and was assembling 
its delegation.  Shamayleh said the delegation was likely, 
but not certain, to be lead by Speaker of the lower house 
Abdelhadi al-Majali, who as president of the AIPU during its 
meeting in Aqaba last year, had endorsed the holding of this 
meeting in Erbil.  Shamayleh also assured polcouns that the 
GOJ had no objection to parliamentary attendance in Erbil. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poloff followed up on February 27 with Sufian 
al-Hassan, director of research in Jordan's lower house and 
the lead official for outside conferences.  Hassan had 
previously indicated that preparations were under way for 
Jordanian participation, and that an Iraqi delegation had 
recently been in town to coordinate technical issues with 
Speaker Majali.  Hassan showed poloff a two-inch thick file 
on the conference that he has already prepared for the 
Jordanian delegation - an indication that attendance is 
expected.  Hassan said that Majali would "almost certainly" 
be going to Erbil, as his role as the current chair of the 
organization necessitated his attendance so as to turn over 
the chairmanship.  Hassan noted that other MPs would be 
joining Majali, but the list was still uncertain due to 
shifting schedules.
