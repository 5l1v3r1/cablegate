SUMMARY. 
 
CIVIL SOCIETY CONFERENCE 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Regional civil society leaders and scholars will 
gather in Indonesia March 6-7 for a conference on how Burma's 
current situation impacts on the security, health, and 
prosperity of the region.  The conference is being funded by 
EAP/PD with assistance from the National Democratic Institute 
(NDI).  It is being organized by a coalition of Indonesian 
activists.  Opened by Indonesia's most prominent human rights 
lawyer, Rafendi Djamin, chair of Human Rights Working Group, 
the conference will lead off with a keynote address by 
Indonesian Parliamentarian Djoko Susilo, the head of the 
ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Myanmar Caucus (AIPMC).  A Burmese 
monk who left Burma after the September uprising, U Awbata, 
is traveling to the conference from Sri Lanka and will make 
opening inspirational remarks. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The first session on "The Current Problem in Burma" 
will be facilitated by Galuh Wandita, director of the 
International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), in 
Jakarta.  Nyo Ohn Myint of the Asia Pacific People's 
Partnership on Burma (APPPB) will talk about the background 
of the present situation and noted scholar Win Min of Chiang 
Mai University will talk on current issues. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) There will also be a session on "Burma as a 
Regional Problem."  Speakers include: 
 
-- Debbie Stothard, Coordinator with Altsean-Burma (an NGO 
focused on regional Burmese matters) and authority on Burma 
transnational issues, speaking about regional security; 
-- Duncan McArthur with the Thailand Burma Border Coalition, 
who has worked in the border region since 1995, speaking on 
migration, refugees, and human trafficking; 
-- Dr. Voravit Suwanvanichkij of John Hopkins University, an 
expert on the spread of HIV/AIDS and other infectious 
diseases resulting from the Burmese situation, speaking on 
drugs and disease; 
-- Zaw Oo from American University and policy advisor to the 
National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, speaking 
on regional economic impacts; and, 
-- Wong Aung, global coordinator for the Shwe Gas Movement, 
speaking on capital investment and the role of economic 
sanctions. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Turning to international responses to the Burma 
crisis, speakers include:  Egoy Bans of the Free Burma 
Coalition; U.S. Embassy Political Counselor Joseph L. Novak 
reviewing the U.S. reaction; Roshan Jason, director of the 
AIPMC in Malaysia; and, Patrick Burgess, of ICTJ Asia.  The 
topic of "Civil Society Responses and Options for Future 
Action" will be reviewed by several regional and Indonesia 
civil society activists from human rights groups, the media 
and labor unions. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) On day two, conference participants will break into 
 
JAKARTA 00000452  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
working groups to recommend strategies on how to bring about 
democracy in Burma and how to support that transition.  A 
declaration and recommended follow-up actions will be 
announced at the closing session, followed by a press 
conference. 
 
MEDIA 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The media is invited to attend the opening session 
and the reading of the final declaration, and is welcome to 
cover all plenary sessions.  PAS is videotaping the main 
events throughout the conference and plans to produce a short 
documentary on DVD for regional distribution, as well as to 
provide broadcast quality video for TV stations which are 
interested but could not attend.  Attendees will all be given 
background material on issues to be covered at the 
conference, including the President's February 25 statement 
on Burma and other U.S. policy articles. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) While the USG role in the conference will be low 
key, the DCM will be holding a dinner for organizers and 
participants, Pol/C will present the U.S. policy viewpoint at 
one session, and our sponsorship will be recognized on logos 
on conference materials.  Mission  is working with IIP to 
produce articles on the conference.  PAS also will send 
photos of the conference to IIP and to other Posts in the 
region with captions. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
 
¶10.  (SBU) As mentioned, participants will issue a 
declaration which will also review follow-up activities.  We 
already understand that the Canadian government plans to 
convene a conference in late March in Quebec City focused on 
Burma (this conference is, in part, directly modeled on the 
Jakarta conference).  NDI also is planning upcoming 
Burma-related events in the East Asian region. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Overall, participants in the conference--many of 
whom were recruited with help from other Missions in the 
region--told us that holding the event in Indonesia is 
significant because of its influence in the region and the 
fact that it recently moved to democracy from an 
authoritarian set-up.  We hope that the conference will 
resonate regionwide, helping stimulate civil society/citizen 
activism on the situation and the need for a change in the 
Burmese status quo.
