(SBU) We spoke on October 15 with Milenko Misic, the Director 
of the Human Rights Division at the Bosnian MFA, regarding 
reftel request about the Goldstone report on conflict in 
Gaza.  Misic told us that the Ministry does not yet have a 
final position on the Goldstone report, but said that the 
Bosnian Ambassador in the UN Human Rights Council has been in 
close touch with the Ministry about the debate taking place 
in the Council on this issue.  Misic said he hopes and 
expects that Bosnia will take the same position as the EU on 
this issue, which he understands is being closely coordinated 
with the U.S. position.
