MESSAGING UPDATE 
 
¶1. This cable includes an action request.  Please see para 5. 
 
¶2. SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST: The Department's Office of 
Intellectual Property Enforcement (IPE) requests post ECON 
Section input in conducting an annual update of coordinated 
USG-wide IPR messaging and factoids. (Please be sure to 
coordinate with PA Section colleagues as appropriate.) 
Organized by region and substantive topic, coordinated IPR 
messaging provides consistent institutional guidance to USG 
officials for use in overseas IPR outreach programs and 
products.  The 2009 update is being conducted via the 
Department's interactive IPR Portal on Diplopedia 
(http://diplopedia.state.gov/IPRPortal).  ECON officers are 
requested to provide messaging and factoid updates no later 
than Friday, April 17, 2009.  See instructions in paras. 5-7. 
End summary. 
 
¶3. BACKGROUND: In Spring 2007, IPE kicked-off the first phase 
of its IPR outreach initiative by working with posts and 
interagency colleagues to develop broadly-coordinated IPR 
messaging segmented by topic, region, and country.  In the 
past two years, this messaging has served as a tremendous 
resource for USG officials to use to build their own knowledge 
bases and upon which to base talking points and ensure 
editorial pieces are appropriately crafted to resonate with 
particular foreign audiences.  Given continual shifts in 
public perceptions and opinion, annual updates are required to 
keep this messaging fresh and relevant to overseas public 
audiences.  As such, post input is crucial to creating an 
effectively targeted and segmented messaging product. End 
Background. 
 
¶4. MESSAGING PROJECT OVERVIEW: The IPR messaging update 
project is broken down by regions and by topic.  Topical areas 
of focus include: 
 
* General IP Messaging 
* Creative Industry, Internet, and Business Software Messaging 
* Public Health and Safety messaging 
* Health and Biotechnology, R&D Messaging 
* Traditional Knowledge Messaging 
* USG Trade and Capacity Building IPR Training Messaging 
* NEW Category: Environment and Global Climate Change 
Messaging 
 
¶5. ACTION REQUEST: IPE requests that all posts provide new and 
updated regional and country IPR information and facts, as 
well as related IPR messaging revisions.  This includes posts 
in regions and host countries which are not currently 
represented on relevant regional or topical messaging pages. 
Where appropriate, posts should include (a) positive impacts 
from IPR protection, (b) negative impacts from lack of 
protection and infringement, (c) actions taken to protect IPR, 
and (d) the results of such actions.  Posts are also requested 
to take note of, and respond to, any existing comments (noted 
in red on the respective Diplopedia pages).  [Note:  To ease 
Post's updating exercise, instructions on how to use 
Diplopedia have been provided in paragraphs 6-7.] 
 
¶6. DIPLOPEDIA PLATFORM AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS: Diplopedia is 
the Department's online interactive encyclopedia of foreign 
affairs information, accessible through OpenNet.  State 
employees are asked to contribute their experience, knowledge, 
and expertise in the form of articles, discussion, and editing 
of material submitted by others.  In order to provide 
messaging input, you will need to sign up for a Diplopedia 
account (if you have not done so already).  To sign up for an 
account, please visit: http://diplopedia.state.gov/help. 
 
¶7. INPUT INSTRUCTIONS: After signing up for an account, sign

browser to open the IPR Portal main page.  On the right hand 
column of the main page, click on "NEW - IPR Messaging Update

any page and insert your updates into the text of the 
messaging page. Be sure to include citations in parenthesis 
following inserted text, where appropriate.  Please also

difficulties editing the messaging page, you may alternatively
