¶1.  (SBU)  On May 23, Ambassador delivered reftel demarche on 
the hybrid UN/AU force in Darfur to MFA Supervising Director 
for Multilateral, Legal and Passport Affairs Paul Essel (the 
Foreign Minister is out of the country and the Deputy 
Minister was unavailable).  Post had already delivered the 
points in writing to Deputy Foreign Minister Osei-Adjei on 
May 21, in addition to the Charge's demarche to Special 
Assistant and Secretary to the President D.K. Osei the same 
day (ref B). 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Essel said the command of Darfur was "a delicate 
situation", requiring Ghana as African Union Chair to strike 
a "delicate balance".  He agreed with the need to act firmly 
regarding Darfur because so many people are dying.  He noted 
that the British High Commissioner had also raised the issue 
of the command of the hybrid force with Deputy Foreign 
Minister Akwasi Osei-Adjei.
