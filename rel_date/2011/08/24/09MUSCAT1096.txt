to the table to seek a settlement for the current situation in the 
country. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) President Karimov had visited Oman October 4-6.  YbA said 
that the Uzbeks have asked the Omanis for support for the 
initiative, and also asked the Omanis to solicit support for the 
initiative from their friends and allies (e.g., the U.S.). 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post will use guidance received subsequently from SCA and 
Embassy Tashkent to convey USG views on the 6 plus 3 proposal to 
the GoO, including the need to ensure that the GoA is involved in 
any regional discussion of Afghanistan.
