REF: A. STATE 015808 B. STATE 5979 C. USUN NEW YORK 91 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) We delivered reftel A demarche on February 9.  We 
thanked GOF for its participation in the Haiti Contact Group 
meeting on February 1 and requested that the GOF urge China 
to support a one-year MINUSTAH mandate renewal.  We delivered 
demarche to MFA DAS-equivalent for Mexico, Central America, 
and the Caribbean Blandine Kreiss, MFA Haiti desk officer 
Cecile Merle, and MFA International Organizations officer 
Benoit Guidee.  Kreiss thanked Poloff for the information and 
responded that France would press China to support a one-year 
MINUSTAH mandate renewal.  Kreiss cautioned, however,that she 
did not believe it likely that China would be swayed to 
change its stance.  Kreiss went on to suggest that, while 
France was not opposed to putting some pressure on China, 
being too aggressive could be counterproductive.
