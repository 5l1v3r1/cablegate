SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED ON INFORMING PARTNERS ON THE 
COMMISSION FOR ASSISTANCE TO A FREE CUBA 
 
REF: STATE 113702 
 
¶1.  (U) Poloff delivered ref points to MFA Americas Desk 
Officer Elchin Bashirov.  Poloff emphasized that since 
Azerbaijan is a member of the United Nations Human Rights 
council, the US Government takes seriously Azerbaijan's 
commitment to work constructively on human rights issues and, 
for this reason, is sharing information on the Commission for 
Assistance to a Free Cuba (CAFC). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Bashirov said that he could not speak 
authoritatively on the subject, but noted that Cuba was not a 
priority for Azerbaijan.  Should the Government of Azerbaijan 
provide substantive comments regarding the issue, post will 
notify Washington.
