CASE 
 
REF: A. 06 BERLIN 3555 
 
     ¶B. 1/8/07 NEUMANN-EUR/AGS EMAIL 
 
¶1. (U) This Cable contains an Action Request.  Please see 
para 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The State Prosecutor's Office in Tuebingen has 
contacted the Staff Judge Advocate, Stuttgart Law Center, 
asking for further information in connection with events 
Murat Kurnaz -- a Turkish citizen resident in Germany -- 
alleges to have happened to him in a U.S.-run prison facility 
in Kandahar.  Kurnaz was detained in Guantanamo beginning in 
2002 and returned to Germany in 2006.  The request follows 
the earlier (ref A) request for videos of his alleged 
questioning by German officials, sent from the Bundestag's 
Investigating Committee to the Ambassador.  The Tuebingen 
State Prosecutor announced January 8 that he will open 
preliminary proceedings against two German Special Forces 
soldiers (ref B).  The two soldiers are alleged to have used 
inappropriate force on Kurnaz during his reported detention 
in the Kandahar facility in January 2002. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Kurnaz made his allegation against two soldiers 
assigned to the KSK (Kommando Spezialkraefte - German Special 
Forces), a unit stationed in Calw (within the jurisdiction of 
the State Prosecutor in Tuebingen).  Dr. Michael Pfohl is the 
Chief Public Prosecutor in the office of the State Prosecutor 
in Tuebingen, and is in charge of investigating the 
allegations of abuse by German soldiers.  Pfohl requests 
information from the USG in connection with the case.  He 
also said the case will be subject to the statute of 
limitations soon and therefore he requests an answer as soon 
as possible.  Pfohl told the Office of the Staff Judge 
Advocate, Stuttgart Law Center, 21st Theater Support Command 
he is preparing an official request to U.S. authorities and 
requested guidance concerning to whom to address his request. 
 He said his questions are: 
 
- Is it possible for trucks or smaller vans to drive into the 
compound/prison/camp? 
 
- If yes, is it true that the vehicles would enter the 
compound on a regular basis to clean toilets and other 
excrement containers? 
 
- Is it possible to name an individual within the 
administration or command of the Kandahar prison camp who 
would be able to testify to the above subject? 
 
- Is it possible to name any individuals who accompanied the 
German soldiers on their tour of the Kandahar Camp? 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post requests guidance in how to respond to the 
Prosecutor's questions. 
 
¶5. (U) This Cable was coordinated with USAREUR.
