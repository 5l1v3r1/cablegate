SUBJECT: NSC Senior Director Ramamurthy discusses S&T with former 
President Habibie 
 
¶1. (SBU) The U.S. Science Envoy effort is already yielding results 
by laying the foundation for expanded science and technology (S&T) 
cooperation.  NSC Senior Director for Global Engagement Pradeep 
Ramamurthy, Ambassador and White House Office of Science and 
Technology Policy Senior Advisor Jason Rao met on January 27 with 
the power center of Indonesia's S&T community, including Former 
President B.J. Habibie, representatives from the Indonesia Academy 
of Sciences, Indonesia Institute of Science, and the International 
Islamic Forum for Science Technology and Human Resources Development 
(IIFTIHAR), to discuss increasing U.S.-Indonesia science and 
technology cooperation on January 27.  Habibie and S&T interlocutors 
welcomed greater S&T engagement with the U.S. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Habibie emphasized the importance of science and technology 
cooperation for bilateral relations and for economic development. 
He also asked that President Obama speak before the IIFTIHAR or 
before the Indonesian Academy of Sciences during his upcoming visit. 
 (Note:  IIFTIHAR is a global Muslim science organization 
established in 1996 by Muslim intellectuals from 84 NGO Islamic 
organizations.  President Habibie is its chairman.)  President 
Habibie also pointed out that President Yudhoyono (SBY) gave 
credibility to the Academy of Science when he became the first 
Indonesian president to deliver a speech there January 20.  In this 
speech, SBY articulated a national science policy for Indonesia. 
SBY decided to give the speech after being invited to attend a 
lecture Science Envoy Bruce Alberts planned to give to the 
Indonesian Academies.  SBY's speech would most likely not have 
happened without U.S. engagement on S&T through the Science Envoy 
effort. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Science Envoy effort is advancing in Indonesia despite 
the postponement of Science Envoy Dr. Bruce Alberts' January visit. 
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Senior Advisor 
Jason Rao covered many of the events originally scheduled for Dr. 
Alberts when the latter was sidelined by an injury.  Rao's visit 
(details reported septel) showed Indonesians that President Obama's 
Cairo speech was real.  As promised, he is sending out envoys to 
discuss possibilities for S&T collaboration, including establishing 
centers of excellence.  Indonesia expressed eagerness to 
collaborate. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The visit underscored, however, that the U.S. could be more 
effective in seizing opportunities for collaboration on research and 
development and "stem" (science, technology, engineering, math) 
education exchanges.  The U.S. trails behind some other countries in 
the region such as Japan, China, and Australia who have been making 
things work in these areas.  The U.S. Science Envoy effort thus far 
has bolstered the Indonesian Academy of Sciences, which promises to 
be a partner for S&T cooperation, starting with building an 
evidence-based policy structure. 
 
¶5. (U) Senior Director Ramamurthy cleared this message.
