SUBJECT:  ICTR SEES "NO VALUE" IN COMMUNICATIONS FROM PAUL 
RUSESABAGINA 
 
REF: 06 KIGALI 1110 
 
¶1.  (U)  Embassy transmits for Department the following 
statement issued by the International Criminal Tribunal for 
Rwanda regarding communications with Paul Rusesabagina. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin text: 
 
Statement 
Office of the Prosecutor 
29 June 2007 
 
Mr. Paul Rusesabagina did write to the ICTR Prosecutor in 
November 2006 with copies to many individuals, including the 
UN Secretary General.  As a matter of routine, the Office of 
the Prosecutor acknowledges all communications, including 
those from individuals, offering information that might be 
useful in the prosecution of cases before the Tribunal.  Our 
response to Mr. Rusesabagina, asked him to submit whatever 
information he possessed concerning crimes allegedly 
committed in Rwanda falling under the statutory mandate of 
the ICTR. 
 
The OTP took the further step of sending a team of 
investigators to meet with Mr. Rusesabagina to receive his 
information.  He offered nothing more than "hearsay" 
information that is of no value in our work. 
 
This is the extent of the contact and communication between 
the Office of the Prosecutor and Mr. Rusesabagina.  To 
clarify, the Office of the Prosecutor has made no promises 
whatsoever to Mr. Rusesabagina. 
 
The Prosecutor has reported to the Security Council on 
numerous occasions that we are conducting investigations into 
crimes allegedly committed by members of the Rwandan 
Patriotic Army in 1994.  In due course, a decision will be 
taken based on the results of those investigations.  If the 
results of the investigations have any impact on the 
Tribunal's Completion Strategy, we will address that issue at 
the appropriate time as the need may warrant. 
 
End text. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment.  As noted in reftel, Rusesabagina has 
taken upon himself the task of communicating with the ICTR 
(and the Queen of England, among others) regarding alleged 
offenses by Rwanda's current government, during the 1994 
genocide and at other times.  He does so with great fervor 
and less than perfect accuracy; the above communication from 
the ICTR shows that the Tribunal is tiring of his claims to 
be conveying useful information of any sort.  End comment.
