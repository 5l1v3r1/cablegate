REF: STATE 7242 
 
¶1. (SBU) On January 26, poloff delivered reftel demarche to the 
Human Rights division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Argentina.  The GOA shared aspects of its carefully-crafted 
recommendations and questions to be presented to Iran during the UN 
Human Rights Council's (HRC) Universal Periodic Review (UPR), and 
confirmed Argentine support for the U.S. recommendations to Iran. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Argentina's submission will feature questions on gender 
equality and anti-discrimination, and the administration of the 
death penalty.  Specifically, Argentina will ask: 
 
 
 
-- What methods have been adopted to improve the judicial and 
social position of women in Iranian society?; and 
 
 
 
-- What methods have the Government of Iran adopted to reduce, and 
in the case of minors abolish, the application of the death 
penalty? 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Argentina will submit recommendations to Iran regarding: 
the death penalty; legal reform of penal law to bring Iran's laws 
in line with international human rights standards; forced 
disappearances; children's rights and countering sexual slavery; 
persecution, mass detention, and illegitimate privation of freedom 
of opposition leaders and NGO members; and ratification of treaties 
against torture and discrimination against women. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was well-aware of the UPR 
opportunity at the UNHRC, and has passed very clear and detailed 
instructions to its mission in Geneva.  The Argentines frequently 
share USG views on Iran and seek to play a positive role on 
improving human rights conditions there.
