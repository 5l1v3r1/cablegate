SUBJECT: INPEX LIKELY TO OPT FOR OFFSHORE LNG TERMINAL IN 
INDONESIA'S MASELA BLOCK 
 
¶1. (SBU) INPEX Corporate Strategy and Planning Division 
Manager Hiroshi Ikeda confirmed the firm expects to make a 
decision in mid-November to construct an LNG terminal to 
service the Abadi gas field in the Masela Block.  Ikeda 
clarified an October 5 Nikkei report, one that suggests the 
firm has decided to go ahead with construction, by saying the 
offshore terminal is "likely", but not yet 100% certain. 
Ikeda said the Nikkei interview with INPEX company President 
Naoki Kuroda was intended to focus on the firm's integration 
with Teikoku Oil Co., not on the LNG terminal construction. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ikeda said INPEX has had a 100% working interest in 
the Masela Block since 1998 and drilled four appraisal wells 
in 2007.  The firm's current production forecasts for the 
Abadi gas field are for between three and five million 
tons/year by 2015.  (Note: This one field would meet about 7% 
of Japan's current LNG import demand). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ikeda explained the feasibility of the offshore 
floating platform is still under review.  Surveys strongly 
suggest the anticipated Abadi gas field's LNG production 
would far exceed the capacity of any offshore terminal 
currently in operation. Thus construction of a new and larger 
offshore terminal is necessary.  The firm is negotiating the 
terms of the next stage of a 20-year production sharing 
contract with Indonesian authorities, and the GOI has 
reportedly requested INPEX construct the new offshore 
platform within Indonesian territorial waters as a 
prerequisite to concluding the contract. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Media reports estimate construction costs at one 
trillion yen (roughly $10 billion), approximately 50% more 
expensive than INPEX's second option of transporting the LNG 
via a 400 kilometer undersea pipeline to an onshore facility 
in Australia.  Ikeda described the Australian option as 
perhaps less expensive and technically easier, but added it 
would have unspecified transaction and tax costs associated 
with transporting the gas across international borders.
