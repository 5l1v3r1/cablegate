POST-NIYAZOV ERA 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) Assistant Secretary Richard Boucher's December 24 visit to 
Turkmenistan generated a high level of international news coverage, 
which was mostly accurate except for some reports claiming that 
Boucher had an official meeting with Interim President Gurbanguly 
Berdimukhammedov.  Turkmenistan'S state media provided limited but 
accurate coverage of the visit of the U.S. delegation led by Boucher 
and of U.S. condolences on the death of Niyazov.  Russian press was 
the source of most negative reports about U.S. intentions in 
Turkmenistan, including suggestions that the U.S. leadership had 
rigged the death of President Niyazov.  In at least one case, 
English language press carried a reference to a U.S. desire for an 
airbase on Turkmenistan soil and a fervently anti-Bush editorial 
suggesting U.S. complicity in Niyazov's death.  Major international 
and U.S. news sources tended to repeat minor factual inaccuracies 
about Niyazov's policies but accurately presented U.S. statements on 
the passing of Niyazov.  End Summary. 
 
Turkmenistan/Regional Press Largely Factual 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Turkmenistan State News Media did not attend the 
embassy-organized press conference for A/S Boucher and only noted 
his attendance at the funeral ceremonies and U.S. condolence 
messages.  Regional press and wire service stories generally carried 
accurate coverage of Boucher's Ashgabat press conference.  Most 
noted that the U.S. hopes for a stable, constitutional transition of 
power and/or that the U.S. sees an opportunity for a new 
relationship with Turkmenistan.  A handful of regional outlets in 
English or Russian also noted the specific areas of interest for 
expanded U.S. cooperation:  education, health, energy policy, and 
border security. 
 
¶3.  (U) Unfortunately, some news outlets (perhaps working from AP 
wire coverage) used the headline, "U.S. Eyes Opportunity in 
Turkmenistan" or similar, giving a slightly sinister spin to A/S 
Boucher's comments. 
 
¶4.  (U) In addition, Reuters and others, apparently using Reuters 
material, misreported that A/S Boucher held talks with Interim 
President Berdimuhammedov.  Another inaccuracy occurred in the 
Russian-language "Trend" outlet of Azerbaijan, which contained 
accurate information from A/S Boucher's press conference, but 
inaccurately wrote that he called for an "amnesty of political 
prisoners." 
 
Russian Black Media Machine Busy Spinning 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Russian TV broadcaster Channel 1, also carried segments 
suggesting that the U.S. will now move to foment a "color 
revolution" in Turkmenistan and that the country could be a base for 
action against Iran.  Post also notes that the Russian-based Regnum 
website carried a story reflecting the opinion of the Chairman of 
the Russian Islamic Committee.  The Chairman insinuated that 
Niyazov's death was likely the work of the United States.  The 
English language Atlantic Free Press of Groningen, Netherlands ran a 
particularly anti-American opinion piece, which also suggested that 
Niyazov would naturally have been a target of U.S. transformational 
diplomacy, and that Niyazov's passing would pave the way for U.S. 
military action against Iran from bases in Turkmenistan.  Some 
Russian news media has reported Vladimir Zhironovsky's comments that 
the U.S. and Iran will now battle for influence in Turkmenistan. 
Other Russain language outlets also discussed the new "great game" 
in Central Asia following Niyazov's death. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (U) Overall, the accuracy and tenor of coverage for Boucher's 
visit was good.  Some inaccuracies were probably not intentional. 
However, given Russian news media's penchant for anti-U.S. 
conspiracy theories, post is concerned that some Russian news 
outlets will reprint or quote at length the Atlantic Free Press 
article mentioned above and at the least continue to warn of a U.S. 
strategy for influence in the region. [End Comment.]
