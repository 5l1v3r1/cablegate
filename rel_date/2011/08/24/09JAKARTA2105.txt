¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On December 22, IO/HRS Director Keshap 
held a constructive meeting with Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Director General for Multi-lateral Affairs Ambassador Rezlan 
Ishar Jenie to explore ways to soften OIC approaches on 
defamation of Islam in the UN.  Jenie made it clear that he 
appreciated the USG's collaborative approach in the UNHRC as 
evidenced by Indonesia's support and cosponsorship of the 
Freedom of Expression Resolution in September.  Although 
Jenie did not respond directly on the subject of defamation, 
he greatly appreciated that the proposal was delivered in 
person in Jakarta by Keshap and promised to study it 
carefully.  Jenie urged U.S. support for the GOI's candidacy 
for a UNHRC seat in 2011.  END SUMMARY. 
 
PRAISE FOR THE USG'S COLLABORATIVE APPROACH 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ambassador Jenie expressed his appreciation for the 
USG's securing of consensus at the UNHRC on the Freedom of 
Expression resolution.  He emphasized that the GOI welcomed 
the inclusion of OIC concerns in the resolution.  He regarded 
the passage of this resolution as a first step in bridging 
the gap between the OIC and the West.  Jenie stated that the 
U.S. rejoining the UNHRC was a constructive step in 
ameliorating the divisiveness in the UNHRC.  He noted that 
Indonesia hoped to return to the UNHRC in 2011 and was 
looking to the U.S. to support its bid. 
 
DEFAMATION ISSUE 
 
¶4.  (SBU) After Keshap's presentation of USG views on the 
topic and presentation of a draft action plan, Ambassador 
Jenie said the defamation issue was important to the 
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), and any change in 
course on the OIC's approach vis-a-vis this issue would need 
to be approved by all 57 members. (Note:  Indonesia was a 
crucial player in the September UNHRC negotiations on freedom 
of expression.  Its constructive interventions made it clear 
that there was no unified OIC position; Indonesia negotiated 
on a national basis.)  Jenie noted that Indonesia's support 
of the current defamation resolution text is not due to 
ideological constraints, but is focused solely on the 
objective of the resolution--promoting respect for religion 
and ensuring equal treatment for Muslim minority populations. 
 
USG PROPOSED PLAN OF ACTION 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Ambassador Jenie and Director for Human Rights 
Primanto Hendrasmoro assured Keshap that they would carefully 
review the action plan.  The GOI would continue to discuss 
the possibility of a March initiative on defamation with 
Embassy Jakarta, Mission Geneva, and Washington.  Jenie 
stated that President Yudhoyono was considering attending the 
meeting as was Foreign Minister Natalegawa.  Jenie commented 
that high-level U.S. participation would further underscore 
the importance that the U.S. attached to defamation. 
 
PROPOSED NEXT STEPS 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mission concurs with IO/HR that securing Indonesia 
as a vocal ally on a new initiative will be critical to 
moderating the strident voices in the OIC, especially from 
some Arab states and Pakistan.  Mission will continue to 
underscore to the GOI the importance that we attach to the 
defamation issue.  We encourage Washington to continue to 
send visitors to Jakarta to further emphasize to GOI 
officials that moving forward on the defamation issue is a 
key priority for the USG in the UNHRC.  In addiiton, we urge 
Washington to consider supporting Indonesia's bid to rejoin 
the UNHRC in 2011.
