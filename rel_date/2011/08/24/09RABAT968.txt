The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation presents its 
compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America in Rabat 
and has the honor to inform the Embassy that the Kingdom of Morocco 
has decided to present its candidature for the post of Member of the 
United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development 
(CSTD), a subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council 
(ECOSOC), for the period 2010-2014, at the elections which will be 
held in New York in May 2010, during the organizational session of 
ECOSOC. 
 
The Kingdom of Morocco has held a seat only once in this Commission, 
which was created in 1992, during the period 2002-2006.  During this 
period, in addition to its active participation in this Commission, 
Morocco was a board member of the 8th Session and organized, in 
November 2005 in Rabat, the 9th Recess Panel on "Reducing the 
Technological Gap between and within Nations." 
 
In view of the excellent relations of friendship and cooperation 
between our two countries, the Moroccan Government kindly requests 
the support of the Government of the United States of America for 
this candidacy. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of 
Morocco takes this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the United 
States of America in Rabat the assurances of its highest 
consideration.
