¶5.  Please consider the following in-country administrative 
notes for Manama, Bahrain: 
 
a)  VISAS:  A visa is required for Bahrain.  U.S. diplomatic 
and official passport holders can obtain a gratis 72-hours or 
a 7-day visa at the airport immigration authority.  If 
traveler is required to stay longer, the visa can be 
extended.  Significant penalties are charged if the visa is 
not extended prior to expiry.  Visitors staying beyond the 
time limit of the visa should submit their passport for visa 
processing by the Embassy at least two days prior to the 
visa's expiration date. 
 
b)  LODGING and TRANSPORTATION:  Visitors must bring adequate 
funds to cover hotel tariffs and expenses.  Hotels accept 
major credit cards (Amex, Visa, MasterCard).  Embassy will 
arrange for airport expediting and transportation upon 
request. 
 
c)  BAGGAGE:  All luggage is subject to x-ray and hand 
inspection by Bahraini customs officials.  Among items that 
may not be brought into Bahrain are:  firearms, large knives, 
swords, videos of any type, and pornography. 
 
d)  DRESS:  Modest dress is more appropriate in Bahrain. 
Both men and women should avoid shorts and sleeveless attire 
in public, although bathing suits and shorts are acceptable 
at hotel facilities. 
 
e)  PHOTOGRAPHY:  Photographing military, religious, and 
government installations is forbidden, and one should ask 
permission before photographing Bahraini Nationals. 
 
f)  LOCAL TIME:  The time difference from Washington D.C. is 
7 hours.  The official Embassy workweek is Sunday through 
Thursday, 0800 to 1700. 
 
¶6.    Security Concerns: 
 
     Manama is a high threat post for terrorism and political 
violence.  Although there have been no terrorist attacks 
against either Americans or Westerners on the island, Bahrain 
is joined by a causeway to Saudi Arabia, a critical threat 
unaccompanied post.  Spontaneous demonstrations take place in 
Bahrain from time to time in response to world events or 
local developments.  Demonstrations are normally 
anti-government in nature and do not target Americans, but 
may turn violent and should be strictly avoided. 
 
      Bahrain is very livable and generally safe, but the 
threat of terrorism and political violence requires embassy 
personnel to take active personal security measures, 
including remaining aware of their surroundings at all times 
and keeping current with local events and embassy security 
notices.  Personnel should vary their routes and times of 
travel, maintain a low profile, and avoid confrontations. 
Any suspicious activity should be immediately reported to the 
Regional Security Office (RSO) along with identifying 
information such as license plate number, vehicle or 
individual descriptions, etc. 
 
      The crime rate is relatively low in Bahrain.  Unlocked 
doors, open windows, building wallets, or unsecured purses 
may invite crimes of opportunity. Common sense precautions 
necessary in any major metropolitan area are appropriate for 
Bahrain. 
 
      The RSO provides a security briefing upon arrival that 
addresses the threat environment and personal security 
measures in detail.  Contact the RSO directly at DS RSO 
Manama@state.gov if you have any security-related questions 
prior to arrival. 
 
Americans should note this information when traveling to 
Bahrain.
