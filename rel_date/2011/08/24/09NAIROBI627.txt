Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, Post submits the following update for 
the third week of March 2009.  End summary. 
 
------------- 
PD Activities 
------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Somalia Unit, including the Military Information 
Support Team (MIST) dedicated to Somalia, performed para. 3-5 
activities since the last report: 
 
¶3. (SBU) PAO and two members of the MIST traveled to Kampala 
to meet with AMISOM spokesman, who is a Ugandan Major, about 
proactive messaging and outreach to highlight the good work 
that AMISOM is doing in Somalia.  The meeting took place at 
the request of the African Union and is envisioned as the 
starting point for an ongoing working group.  The spokesman 
was extremely receptive to the forms of assistance the USG 
group was able to offer, including sharing our vast network 
of Somalia media outlet contacts, suggesting text for press 
releases, and sharing general expertise on public diplomacy 
operations.  A major and vital undertaking will be 
development of content for the station to be hosted on the 
AF/RSA-funded transmitter, once the equipment arrives in the 
region.  Several follow-on actions came from the meeting, 
focusing on the areas of FM radio, the AMISOM website, and 
"quick wins." 
 
¶4. (SBU) PAO remains engaged with he Transitional Federal 
Government's (TFG) staff on U.S. assistance with their 
outreach efforts.  The TFG remains receptive, but has been 
slow in appointing staff and specifying responsibilities 
among the spokesman, Minister of Information, and other 
actors.  PAO met with TFG officials on March 19 and reviewed 
several methods by which the U.S. can assist the TFG in their 
own PD efforts. 
 
¶5. (SBU) MIST activity: No programs were aired during this 
reporting period due to contracting issues.  Programs will be 
aired has soon has all contracting issues have been resolved 
and all vendors have been paid for their prior work.
