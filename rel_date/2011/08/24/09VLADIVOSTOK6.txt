SUBJECT: POLITICAL LEADERS PREFER JAPANESE CARS OVER "RIDING ON A 
COW'S BACK" 
 
¶1. Summary.   It is clear that citizens of the Russian Far East 
are strongly against Moscow's effort to encourage the Russian 
car manufacturing industry by increasing customs fees on 
imported second-hand Japanese cars.  Political leaders in the 
region, however, are caught between the clear will of their 
constituents and federal directives issued by Moscow.  As 
politicians in the Russian Far East find themselves increasingly 
evaluated by citizens on how they stand on the policy, few are 
showing support for using Russian-built cars. 
 
Plenty of Japanese Cars For Official Use 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On January 22, Vladivostok Mayor Igor Pushkaryov presented 
twenty imported right-hand-drive Nissan and Toyota vehicles to 
the Vladivostok militia for official use.  He stated "these cars 
are best for the traffic police's needs.  According to 
specialists, these right-hand-drive cars are optimal due to 
their price to quality ratio." One month earlier Mayor 
Pushkaryov presented twenty imported Japanese cars to municipal 
medical clinics. 
 
¶3.  Pushkaryov is in an interesting position.  He is the mayor 
of the city at the epicenter of recent demonstrations and 
initially expressed support for the demonstrators.  He must also 
keep one eye on how Moscow will react to support he offers them. 
 During the first demonstration against customs fees in 
November, Pushkaryov made a speech supporting the demonstrators' 
position and signed a petition against the customs fee increase. 
 During a subsequent demonstration, however, he turned away 
demonstrators who appeared in front of his office for further 
support. 
 
¶4.  While demonstrators in Vladivostok have been having 
difficulty obtaining demonstration permits, those in Khabarovsk 
have had an easier time.  One reason may be their governor's own 
preference for Japanese imports.  Governor Viktor Ishayev 
recently related to journalists his experience of switching from 
Russian-made to Japanese cars.  He likened riding in Russian car 
as being "like riding on a cow's back." 
 
¶5.  Officials throughout the region have continued purchasing 
Japanese imports.  According to an unnamed source at the 
Vladivostok automobile registration agency, the Far Eastern 
Directorate of the Russian Federal Construction Agency 
registered two dozen new Toyota Land Cruisers in late December 
¶2008.  Nikolay Kologorov, Khabarovsk regional Minister for 
Agriculture stated in the media that "before purchasing Russian 
vehicles it is necessary to measure all the pros and cons.  A 15 
percent customs increase is no reason to stop relying on foreign 
technical expertise." 
 
Governor's Russian Car Directive Ignored 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  One official actually echoing Moscow's position is Amur 
Governor Oleg Kozhemyako, who called on all public officials in 
the oblast to use Russian-made automobiles -- a directive which 
met with little enthusiasm.  Blagoveshchensk Mayor Aleksandr 
Migulya publicly responded that he will refuse to trade in his 
Toyota for a Russian car, since he has no complaints with it and 
has no good reason to replace it.  Amur Oblast Senator Amir 
Gallyamov also expressed disproval with Kozhemyako's edict, 
stating to the press that "RFE residents should personally 
decide what car is more suitable for their own needs." He 
further stated that though he agrees that Russian automobile 
producers deserve support, competition should not be stifled and 
that he doubts federal actions will be successful in improving 
local industry. 
 
¶7.  Comment.  Despite directives from the Kremlin to support 
domestic industry, most political leaders in the RFE refuse to 
give up their Japanese imports. They realize that the issue of 
increased fees for imported Japanese automobiles is of paramount 
concern for residents and few officials publicly express support 
for the Kremlin's move.  This weekend's unofficial rally in 
Vladivostok may be a harbinger of further demonstrations, or an 
indication that the popular movement against higher import 
duties is already out of gas owing to the firm line from Moscow. 
 We expect continued discontent in the RFE over the issue, but a 
more cautious approach from protesters and an interesting 
balancing act from officials.
