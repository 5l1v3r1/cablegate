1, Embassy on November 24 delivered reftel demarche to MFA UN 
affairs director Michelle Cohen, emphasizing the importance 
of the upcoming votes in the UNGA to promote more equitable 
treatment of Israel in the UN and to advance the cause of UN 
reform.  Political officer also highlighted the urgency of 
getting instructions to the Dominican UN mission in New York. 
 We asked that the Dominican Republic consider voting "no" to 
the proposed extension of the mandate of three outmoded UN 
bodies dealing with Israeli-Palestinian issues.  Cohen had no 
immediate reaction, but will study our points -- which we 
delivered as a non-paper -- and engage MFA decisionmakers.
