SUBJECT:  GOT WILL CONSIDER FUNDING EXTERNAL EVALUATION 
OF FAO 
 
Ref: State 25999 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche, encouraging 
the GOT to make voluntary contributions toward the costs 
of an independent evaluation of FAO, to Asim Asar, 
Multilateral Economic Organizations Department Head, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on February 16.  Asar 
responded that the GOT supported the concept of an 
independent evaluation of FAO, as well as the need for 
reform in that organization.  He stated that the GOT has 
not made voluntary contributions to international 
organizations for the last three years, but that 
officials are considering a change in this policy in 
conjunction with Turkey's plans to run for election to 
the UN Security Council in 2008.  Asar told us MFA was 
working to secure interagency clearance for a USD 
350,000 contribution to the World Food Program for aid 
to Tajikistan, and added that MFA might try to secure a 
contribution to the FAO if it is successful in obtaining 
the WFP contribution. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Asar added that Turkey had already agreed to 
support the reelection of Jacques Diouf to the FAO 
Director General position, in line with a decision taken 
earlier by the Organization of the Islamic Conference on 
the election.
