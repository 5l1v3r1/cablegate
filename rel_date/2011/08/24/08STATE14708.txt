SUBJECT: GUIDANCE FOR SECURITY COUNCIL CONSULTATIONS ON 
CHAD 13 FEBRUARY 2008 
 
 1)  PURPOSE:  This is an action request.  The Department 
asks USUN to draw upon the following themes during U/SYG 
Guehenno's briefing to the Security Council on the effects of 
hostilities in Chad on the deployment of the United Nations 
Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) 
and the European Union force (EUFOR) on 13 February 2008: 
 
-- We appreciate Under Secretary-General Guehenno's briefing 
on the situation in Chad and its effects on the deployment of 
EUFOR and MINURCAT.  We continue to be very concerned by the 
recent fighting in Chad and the government of Sudan's attacks 
in Darfur that have resulted in 10,000-12,000 new refugees 
from Darfur moving into eastern Chad.  We are concerned as 
well about conflict in the Central African Republic that has 
resulted in 7,400 new refugees in Chad from the Central 
African Republic in the past weeks.   Ensuring adequate 
protection of these vulnerable people, as well as the nearly 
300,000 refugees and 180,000 internally displaced persons, 
who have already been living in camps, must be of the highest 
priority. 
 
-- We are grateful to Chad for the hospitality it has offered 
to the nearly 300,000 refugees from Darfur and the Central 
African Republic who are now residing within its borders.  We 
ask that the GOC continue, consistent with its international 
treaty undertakings, to extend its hospitality to the 
newly-arrived refugees.  We understand the substantial burden 
such an effort has placed on Chadians, and we will continue 
to work with the international community to help Chad bear 
this burden. 
 
-- Security must be the utmost priority for these refugees 
and other displaced persons.  We fully support the rapid 
deployment of EUFOR and MINURCAT to provide protection for 
these people.  We urge all Security Council members to 
facilitate this deployment by all means possible. 
 
-- We recognize that peace in Darfur is essential to prevent 
further flows of refugees into Chad.  We therefore urge that 
the governments of Sudan and Chad and the rebels groups that 
they support engage in a comprehensive cease-fire.  We urge 
compliance with the Tripoli Agreement of 8 February 2006, the 
Riyadh Agreement of 3 May 2007, the Sirte Agreement of 25 
October 2007, and all other existing ceasefire agreements. 
We urge progress on the United Nations-African Union-led 
political process for a lasting settlement for Darfur. 
 
 
-- We view the rapid deployment of the United Nations-African 
Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) to be a critical element for 
sustainable peace in Darfur.  We urge the government of Sudan 
(GOS) to cooperate fully in this regard.  The GOS' agreement 
to a Status of Forces Agreement, while a step in the right 
direction, leaves numerous details unresolved, suggesting 
further obstructions that will continue to delay deployment 
of UNAMID.  In our view, Sudan's lack of cooperation, its 
foot-dragging on countless issues, and its unwillingness to 
live up fully to its past commitments have contributed 
greatly to a larger instability in the region.  It is hard 
for us to separate recent events on the ground -- the January 
7 attack on a UNAMID convoy, the support for rebel attacks 
against the government of Chad, and the recent bombing of 
west Darfur that resulted in the loss of innocent civilian 
lives -- from the government's refusal to enhance security in 
Darfur by actively supporting the rapid deployment of UNAMID. 
 In our view, a concerted effort by Sudan to support UNAMID 
will help undermine the rebels operating in Sudan, reduce 
tension with Chad, and help build an environment that will 
allow peacekeepers in Chad and Sudan to create a more secure 
environment, and lower the loss of innocent lives. 
 
-- All Security Council member states must cooperate fully 
with efforts for the rapid deployment of EUFOR, MINURCAT, and 
UNAMID, including by abiding by the existing UN arms embargo 
in Sudan.  Given continued obstruction, further measures by 
the Security Council must remain on the table.
