¶1.  Summary:  A visiting IMF team led by Johanness Mueller provided 
an end-of-mission briefing for donors on July 26 to inform them of 
the state of the ongoing negotiations of a new program with Senegal. 
  Mueller termed FY 2006 a "difficult year," and said that, while 
Senegal is still struggling to adjust to the energy crisis, the 
economy may recover in 2007 thanks to the resumption of ICS 
operations and 
 
 
 
  the buoyant service and construction sectors.  Mueller emphasized 
the need for greatly increased fiscal discipline, reduced levels of 
domestic internal debt, and reduced level of expenditures to focus 
on priority sectors.  He noted that Senegal would need to weigh all 
costs and benefits in deciding to seek PSI status.  He praised the 
new GOS for its spirit of cooperation and openness and said the IMF 
board would probably approve Senegal's PSI by September.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  The IMF team visited Senegal July 12 trough July 26 to negotiate 
a new program with Senegal.  Mueller provided an end-of-mission 
briefing for donors on July 26.  Embassy representatives from 
France, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, 
Canada, Holland, Spain, The European Union, World Bank, African 
Development Bank, Kuwait, India, and the U.S. attended the IMF's 
July 26 out-briefing. 
 
2006 A "DIFFICULT YEAR" 
 
¶3.  In reviewing the state of the economy, Mueller said that 2006 
had been extremely difficult.  He estimated real GDP growth for 2006 
at 2.1 percent and year-end inflation at 3 percent.  Mueller blamed 
the energy crisis, the presidential and legislative elections held 
in February and June 2007, and the ICS crisis for having further 
deteriorated the macroeconomic situation in 2006. 
 
¶4.  For FY 2007, Mueller predicted that GDP growth should be around 
5.4 percent and 5.1 percent for the upcoming year 2008 - as a result 
of the buoyant service and construction sectors and the positive 
resumption of ICS operations, with inflation increasing at 5 
percent.  Mueller stated, "we are less concerned about macroeconomic 
issues, and most of our discussions with GOS officials focused on 
budget policy, good governance and transparency." 
 
A HOST OF PROBLEMS, BUT... 
 
¶5.  Mueller reiterated a familiar litany of looming problems that 
the GOS must deal with promptly and decisively.  He enumerated 
several priorities: 
-- getting GOS institutions operating effectively, 
-- prioritizing investment projects and increasing spending on 
poverty reduction, health, education, and agricultural sectors, 
-- containing the budget deficit at 4.7 percent of GDP in the medium 
term, 
-- containing the wage bill which increased significantly in FY 2006 
and FY 2007, 
-- limiting subsidies to the energy sector, 
-- eliminating the outstanding internal debt in the short term and 
reducing payment arrears, 
-- initiating a structural reform on budget by strengthening good 
governance and transparency in public spending, 
-- reinforcing procurement laws, regulations and procedures to 
ensure transparency and good governance, 
-- formulating the role of the private sector in the development 
process, 
-- strengthening measures to limit the number of agencies, and 
-- speeding up the financial sector reforms in cooperation with the 
BCEAO to establish a legal and regulated framework for SMEs and 
MSIs. 
 
GOOD SPIRIT OF COOPERATION 
 
¶6.  Mueller praised the GOS's cooperation and open-ness and stated 
"we have received documents with outstanding information and 
reliable data that demonstrated GOS willingness to quickly conclude 
a program with the IMF."  With regard to the previous 
administration's misreporting of some bilateral arrears, Mueller 
said his team had held "very fruitful discussions" with the new GOS 
officials.  He said that he had obtained all the data he needed and 
would take this back to IMF management to decide next step.  He 
complimented the GOS for its "excellent spirit of sharing 
 
DAKAR 00001591  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
information," and said that the Finance Ministry and IMF were 
"struggling together" to get a clear picture of the GOS's arrears 
position. 
 
¶7.  Mueller indicated that his team has received - for the first 
time - reliable information on APIX and ANOCI regarding their 
tenders and contracts.  He noted that the GOS is open to revising 
the institutional architecture of the new airport project and 
changing the status of APIX. 
 
¶8.  Mueller supported the re-establishment of a recent dialogue 
between the World Bank, the African Development Bank (AFDB), and the 
Islamic Development Bank (IDB) with Senegal to speed up the energy 
sector reform.  He said that without a reform of the energy sector 
it would be difficult for Senegal to meet the requirements of any 
program with the IMF.  He also encouraged the AFDB's cooperation 
with Senegal on issues related to the accelerated growth strategy 
process, the improvement of the business climate, and the discussion 
on the energy sector reform in cooperation with the WB, and the 
IDB. 
 
SENEGAL WANTS A PSI 
 
¶9.  In a later conversation with Senegal's IMF Resrep Alex Segura on 
July 30, post learned that the GOS has now formally requested the 
institution of a PSI program with the IMF.  The IMF team would 
review and submit Senegal's proposal to its Headquarters for 
approval, then once approved the document would be transmitted to 
the IMF Board of Directors which might take the final decision by 
the end of September.  Though there is no major difference within 
the two programs (PSI and PRGF), the PSI seems to be less flexible 
and more constraining than the PRGF and it also focuses more on 
economic growth and structural reforms. 
 
¶10.  COMMENT:  Mueller was repeatedly complimentary of the GOS on 
its spirit of cooperation and openness, though any new program with 
the IMF could bring back donor confidence and raise Senegal's 
credibility. It is not surprising to see Senegal adhere to a PSI 
program that could ease the way toward government borrowing from 
commercial lenders or expanded bond issuance.  While we expect donor 
support is likely to be forthcoming, Senegal will have to commit to 
deeper economic reforms that will improve the business climate and 
establish transparency in the procurement and budget allocation 
process.  Senegal might be eligible to defend its position in the 
October 3-4 Paris Club Consultative Group meeting in Paris, should 
the IMF Board approve its new PSI.
