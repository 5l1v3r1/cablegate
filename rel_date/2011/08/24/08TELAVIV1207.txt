Key stories in the media:

Both Yediot and Maariv led with statements by senior current and 
past Israeli defense sources that Israel will have to attack Iran. 
In an interview with Yediot, Transportation Minister (and former 
chief of staff and defense minister) Shaul Mofaz urges Israel to act 
with American assistance.  Ha'aretz quoted Olmert aides as saying 
that progress was made in forging a common U.S.-Israeli position on 
Iran's nuclear program.  Ha'aretz quoted a senior source in Olmert's 
entourage as saying yesterday that Olmert told the U.S. 
administration that Iran had still not reached the point of no 
return expertise.  The source quoted Olmert as saying that it is 
therefore paramount that sanctions be stepped up.  Makor 
Rishon-Hatzofe reported that Olmert asked Bush to close Iranian 
banks.  Media quoted sources in Washington as saying that there also 
had been progress in Israel's attempt to purchase advanced fighter 
aircraft, and the inclusion of the IAF in the USAF global early 
warning system against incoming ballistic missiles.  The Jerusalem 
Post reported that House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard 
Berman, whose panel has hitherto prevented the sale to Israel of the 
F-22 stealth fighter jet, told the newspaper yesterday that he was 
open to removing the sales restriction to boost Israeli deterrence. 
 
 
Ha'aretz reported that PM Ehud Olmert told President Bush and 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas this week that he believes he 
can overcome his legal and political difficulties and stay in 
office.  Similar to other media, Makor Rishon-Hatzofe reported on a 
rift in the government coalition: The Labor ministers have decided 
to support the dissolution of the Knesset, which led to Olmert 
stating that, should they do so, he would fire them.  Ha'aretz found 
that without Labor there is not yet enough support in the Knesset to 
pass a dissolution measure.   Ha'aretz reported that the Arab 
parties and Meretz would not support such a move since elections 
would most likely return Likud to power. 
 
Leading media reported that yesterday Olmert told
