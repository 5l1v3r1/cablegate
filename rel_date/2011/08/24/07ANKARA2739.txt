SUBJECT: Update on PKK Violence (October 24-31, 2007) 
 
REF: ANKARA 2677 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) website, which documents contacts and clashes with the PKK as 
well as casualties incurred.  The TGS does not account for police 
casualties and the Ministry of Interior casualty date is not made 
public.  As a result, actual numbers for total Turkish law 
enforcement casualties are higher than the figures in this cable. 
Press services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) During the October 24-31, 2007 reporting period, four GOT 
security officials were killed, including one in a mine blast.  One 
security official was injured in an explosion. 
 
¶3. (U) 45 PKK terrorists were killed during the same period.  Seven 
PKKers were captured. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported 13 clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists.  However, subsequent to an October 21 ambush 
that resulted in the deaths of 12 soldiers, the Turkish military has 
been continuing non-stop operations in the region.  Security forces 
discovered at least 17 PKK shelters/caves/caches and seized 
booby-trapped land mines; other explosives, including A-4 and TNT; 
Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; hand grenades; pistols; night vision 
binoculars; TV sets; satellite antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) Security forces reportedly detected at least 11 PKK explosive 
devices in SE Turkey during the reporting period, detonating several 
of them in controlled fashion before they could explode. 
 
¶6. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
