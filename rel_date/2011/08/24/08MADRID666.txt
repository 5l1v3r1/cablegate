REF: STATE 62133 
 
¶1.  Embassy shared open source information about the June 24 
Berlin Conference in Support of Palestinian Civil Security 
and the Rule of Law with Spanish MFA Deputy Director General 
for the Middle East Alberto Ucelay.   Spain intends to 
participate in the conference and attended the preparatory 
sessions in Berlin and Jericho.   Ucelay said it is 
critically important to show progress to local populations 
and advance the themes of the Annapolis Conference. 
 
¶2. Spain agrees with the need to support the development of a 
functioning Palestinian state and is finalizing its pledge at 
this time.  Ucelay said that Spain views the Palestinian 
security sector as a fundamental pillar and will continue 
support through the EUPOL COPPS program.  Spain already has 
given 10 million euros for equipment through the EUPOL COPPS 
mechanism in 2005.  In addition, Spanish officials from the 
National Police and Civil Guard have participated in the EU 
mission.
