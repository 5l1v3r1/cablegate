In Today's Papers 
 
CHP Ready to Push the Button for Early Polls 
Today's papers draw attention to the words of CHP leader 
Deniz Baykal that CHP lawmakers could resign to trigger 
early elections.  Left-leaning daily Cumhuriyet reports 
Baykal said that discord between AKP and the Turkish public 
was growing. According to the politician, people who do not 
believe in the constitution cannot become president in 
Turkey. 
 
Hirant Dink Hearing Adjourned due to Protests 
Cumhuriyet, Radikal:  The first session of Agos newspaper 
editor Dink's case was postponed because of protests by 
nationalist groups against Dink and his lawyers.  Dink, 
Editor-in-Chief of Turkish-Armenian bilingual daily Agos, 
and writer Aydin Engin are being tried on charges of 
'interfering with the legal process' over two articles that 
appeared in the daily last November. 
 
Greek Organization Demands Turkey Apologize for Pontus 
'Genocide' 
Milliyet reports the Greek-based Federation of Pontus 
Organizations said it would submit a file to EU officials in 
Brussels, claiming some 400,000 Pontus Greeks were killed by 
the Ottomans in Turkey's Black Sea region between 1914-23. 
Yorgo Parharidis, the chairman of the Federation, said 
Turkey must apologize for the Pontus 'genocide.'  Parharidis 
noted a 'World Pontus Hellenism Congress' would be convened 
in Athens in June. 
 
Gul and Rice Agree to Diplomat Exchange Program 
Sabah reports that during US Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice's visit to Ankara, after agreeing on the Strategic 
Vision document, Turkey and the US agreed on an interesting 
cooperation plan, which had been kept secret until now. 
According to Sabah, from now on a Turkish Diplomat will have 
a permanent office in the US State Department and similarly, 
a Turkish-speaking American diplomat with expertise in 
Turkey from the State Department will be placed in the 
Foreign Ministry in order to help with the possible crises 
which might occur between Turkey and the US. 
 
PM Erdogan's Possible Visit to the US 
Radikal reports that Foreign Ministry and Prime Ministry 
advisers have started planning for PM Erdogan's visit to the 
US.  FM Abdullah Gul and PM Erdogan either will fly to the 
US  together at the end of June or the beginning of July, or 
Gul will go to the US after the EU summit in Luxembourg on 
June 12-13, to make preparations for the PM's visit. 
According to Radikal, while Erdogan holds talks with 
President Bush, Gul might hold meetings with the US State 
Department.  If President Bush's schedule does not permit a 
visit in June or July, then Erdogan might postpone his visit 
to September. 
 
Commentary on Iraq, Libya 
Mete Cubukcu wrote on the deteriorating situation in Iraq in 
the leftist Birgun:  "Five months after the elections the 
government in Iraq has almost been finalized, but at the 
same time Shiites have started using violence against the 
Sunnis.  There are ongoing massacres of Sunnis while the US 
has also been involved in the situation by forming Shiite- 
origin death squads.  According to recent reports, Iraqi 
security units are incapable of controlling 'certain forces' 
which also indicates that Iraq has started suffering from a 
dirty civil war followed by a dirty occupation.  At this 
point, the story in the American Hartford Courant adds 
another negative dimension.  It looks like American forces 
serving in Iraq will soon start suffering from an Iraq 
 
ANKARA 00002812  002 OF 002 
 
 
syndrome.  Along with other consequences, the US will have 
to bear an unexpectedly high human cost because of this 
war." 
 
Yilmaz Oztuna, writing in the conservative Turkiye, applauds 
Libyan leader Khaddafi for changing course and joining the 
international community: "The resumption of diplomatic ties 
between US and Libya and the removal of Libya's name from 
the terrorist states list are significant successes and the 
Libyan leader Khaddafi deserves credit.  He was smart enough 
to make a radical change in Libya's policy following the 
developments in Iraq.  He not only stopped the weapons of 
mass destruction program but also asked Washington to 
participate in the BMENAI process.  Khaddafi did the right 
thing and saved his country from further troubles."
