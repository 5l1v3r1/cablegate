¶1.  (SBU)  Poloff discussed Turkey's support for the 
Foundation for the Future October 21 with MFA Policy Planning 
officer Levent Gumrukcu.  Asked about Turkey's likely 
contribution to the Foundation, Gumrukcu said his office had 
proposed USD 500,000 and was awaiting Foreign Minister Gul's 
approval.  He said he expected the figure to stand, however, 
with an official announcement in a few days.  Gumrukcu said 
he was aware of the USD 1 million minimum pledge and 
explained that USD 500,000 was all that the MFA could spare 
from its current BMENA budget without jeopardizing Turkey's 
Democracy Assistance Dialogue (DAD) projects.  He said that 
additional funds may be found in a future budget cycle. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Gumrukcu appreciated our providing Foundation and 
Fund for the Future concept papers for comment.  He said the 
GOT is concerned the USD 1 million floor on contributions to 
the Foundation may discourage some smaller donors in the 
region and wondered if this ante could be made less strict. 
According to Gumrukcu, Turkey may also suggest that the ban 
on government officials on the Foundation Board be modified 
to allow a limited number of widely-respected technocrats to 
serve, in order to give interested governments the sense they 
are participating.  He admitted this end could also be served 
via a separate government steering committee.
