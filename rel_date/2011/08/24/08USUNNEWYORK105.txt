LOCATION OF MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE 
 
REF: A. STATE 1070 (2007) 
 
     ¶B. USUN/IO EMAIL (TERMS OF REFERENCE)-02/04/08 
 
¶1. (SBU) Action request:  At a February 5 experts' meeting 
with the U.S., Germany, and the Netherlands to discuss issues 
relating to the formation of the Management Committee for the 
Special Tribunal for Lebanon, France withdrew its proposal 
that the Committee should be based in The Hague.  Instead, 
France proposed that the Terms of Reference for the Committee 
provide for the Committee to meet in New York and, as 
appropriate, in The Hague.  The French made this proposal 
because they believe, as do the Dutch, British, and Germans, 
that the Management Committee would benefit from 
on-the-ground monitoring of the Tribunal in The Hague, but 
recognize that the primary location of the Committee should 
be in New York in order to take advantage of the presence of 
UN Secretariat and Fifth and Sixth Committee budgetary and 
legal experts.  USUN seeks instructions to accept the 
language in para 2, which would be incorporated as section 
VII of the Terms of Reference of the Management Committee 
(ref B). 
 
¶2. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT: 
 
VII - The Management Committee will meet in New York and, as 
appropriate, in The Hague.  Representatives of the Member 
States of the Management Committee in The Hague will 
cooperate and be closely associated with the work of the 
Committee.  An effective liaison mechanism will be 
established.
