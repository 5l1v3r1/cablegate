SUBJECT: CYPRUS DEFENDS MEMBERSHIP IN BIASED, ANTI-ISRAEL 
UN COMMITTEE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 159386 
 
 Per reftel, PolOff on November 28 demarched Attache Dionysis 
Dionysiou, Department of Middle East and Africa, Cyprus 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  PolOff outlined U.S. 
opposition to biased, anti-Israel UN General Assembly 
Resolutions in general, and focused on USG efforts to oppose 
mandate renewal for UN institutions that did not contribute 
to peace between Israelis and Palestinians.  Dionysiou 
replied that the RoC likely would support a resolution 
extending the mandate for the Committee on the Exercise of 
the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.  Cyprus was 
a member of the committee, had made a commitment to support 
its mission, and intended to honor its commitment. 
Nonetheless, Dionysiou promised to pass our message to his 
superiors.  Concluding the call, he revealed that the 
British, Australians and Israelis had made similar demarches 
to the RoC to end its membership in the UN body.
