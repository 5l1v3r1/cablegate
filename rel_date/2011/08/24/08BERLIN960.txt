"Dear Mr. Minister, 
 
Thank you for your letter of June 23, 2008, informing me on 
the U.S. position regarding an important subject of the 
Japanese G8 presidency and explaining your proposals in 
regard to neglected tropical diseases and skilled health care 
workers. 
 
I am happy to forward this information to the health experts 
at the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development as 
well as sections of the government that are involved in the 
negotiations of the summit documents, especially Dr. 
Pfaffenbach, personal representative of the German Chancellor 
for the G8 World Economic Summit.  As I hear, the talks of 
the Sherpas regarding the summit documents are far advanced. 
I am confident that the further negotiations will lead to a 
good and satisfactory result for all. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Reinhard Silberberg"
