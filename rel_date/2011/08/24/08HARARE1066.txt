------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Harare EAC convened on December 2 to discuss recent 
incidents involving disgruntled soldiers (reftel) and a 
planned December 3 demonstration by the Zimbabwe Council of 
Trade Unions (ZCTU) and the National Constitutional Assembly 
(NCA).  The EAC determined that these developments required 
close monitoring but that advising official Americans to 
carry radios was the only appropriate change in security 
posture at this time.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Frustrated Soldiers Attacking Money Changers 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Harare EAC convened on December 2.  Ambassador 
McGee chaired the meeting, which was attended by the DCM, 
RSO, POL, CONS, MGT, DAO, RAO, CDC, PAO, USAID, IPC, MED, and 
GSO.  The EAC discussed recent incidents (reftel) in which 
frustrated soldiers caused disturbances and attacked money 
changers.  RSO noted that as of 1630, Tuesday, December 2, 
the police were maintaining a show of force in the city, 
having deployed two water cannons and an armored personnel 
carrier (APC) manned by 40 armed police at Harare Central 
Police Station.   In addition, armed Military Police squads 
were rounding up rogue soldiers within the city.  DATT 
commented that these measures would likely suppress potential 
demonstrations for some time, but RSO and DATT predicted that 
these incidents were likely to recur as long as soldiers are 
not adequately paid.  CONS reviewed their latest Warden 
Message on the demonstrations and agreed to send to all 
Mission personnel. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) RSO advised that his staff was maintaining a 
presence in the city to provide early warning of any 
disturbances and recommended that all personnel be instructed 
to carry their radios at all times.  American citizens were 
advised in the Warden Message to avoid any unnecessary travel 
within the central business district; this applied equally to 
official Americans.  The EAC agreed with these measures. 
 
-------------------------- 
ZCTU AND NCA DEMONSTRATION 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The DCM and RSO outlined the ZCTU protest scheduled 
for Wednesday, December 3 and the NCA protest scheduled for 
Thursday, December 4.  The ZCTU protest was to take place 
country wide at all bank outlets to protest limits on 
currency.  A march was planned in Harare beginning at 0830 
local time at Kwame Nakruna and 1st streets ending one block 
away at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) headquarters.  NCA 
protests had been occurring the past several weeks at the 
Parliament building where they were most recently dispersed 
with tear gas. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The EAC agreed that the security measures outlined 
in paragraph 3 were sufficient to cover these events.  CDC 
was cautioned that the ZCTU march was scheduled to take place 
very close to their location and to remain vigilant. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) NOTE:  As of 1130 local December 3, a police 
roadblock remained in place at the intersection of Kwame 
Nakruna and 1st street.  Police were observed by RSO 
personnel beating a limited number of presumed protesters. 
This police presence appears to have prevented the march from 
taking place.  END NOTE. 
 
------------------------- 
CHOLERA AND MEDICAL CARE 
------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Consular commented to the EAC that in recent weeks 
the cholera outbreak and lack of medical services in Zimbabwe 
had worsened.  He suggested that a Travel Alert be drafted to 
alert American Citizens.  The EAC agreed and a draft Travel 
Alert is presently in the Embassy clearance process. 
 
----------- 
CONCLUSION 
 
HARARE 00001066  002 OF 002 
 
 
----------- 
 
¶8.  (U) The EAC will continue to monitor these events and 
provide updates as conditions warrant.
