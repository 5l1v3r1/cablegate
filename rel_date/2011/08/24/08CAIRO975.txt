1.(SBU) Summary:  During a May 7 introductory call, the 
Ambassador and Grand Imam Sheikh Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi, 
head of Egypt's Al Azhar institution and Egypt's senior 
Islamic cleric, discussed Al Azhar's role in combating 
extremism and promoting tolerance and interfaith 
understanding.  Tantawi also expressed Al Azhar's 
appreciation for the Mission-supported English language 
program, established in the fall of 2007, to provide English 
instruction to junior theology and Arabic language 
instructors.  Finally, Sheikh Tantawi said Egypt welcomes any 
U.S. assistance that leads to "prosperity and development." 
End summary. 
 
2.(SBU)  Al Azhar, a religious and educational institution, 
includes Egypt's oldest university and serves as a pan-Arab 
center for Sunni thought and education.  In addition to the 
university in Cairo, Al Azhar operates schools throughout 
Egypt, and, according to  Tantawi, has over 2 million 
students studying at the elementary, secondary and university 
levels. Tantawi spoke proudly of the international nature of 
Al Azhar, and said it currently has students from 104 
countries. 
 
3.(SBU)  According to Tantawi, an Al Azhar education is based 
on the rejection of extremism and fanaticism.  He reiterated 
his condemnation of the September 11 attacks and the killing 
of innocents.  While he said that people are "not angels" and 
"bad things" happen, he sees Al Azhar's mission as educating 
students so that they understand Islam's peaceful, 
non-violent nature. 
 
4.(SBU)  While Tantawi acknowledged that Egyptians and 
Americans do not share all religious beliefs, he said that is 
no barrier to cooperation   Tantawi said that the U.S. and 
Egypt share "mutual interests," and cooperation benefits both 
countries.  Prompted by a question from the Ambassador on how 
best the U.S. can help Egypt, Tantawi said Egypt would 
welcome any assistance that led to "prosperity and 
development." 
 
4.(SBU)  Tantawi stressed Al Azhar's role in fostering 
equality.  He said that Islam draws no distinction between 
men and women, and asserted that over half of Al Azhar's 
students, including at the university level, are women.  On 
interfaith issues, Tantawi cited his excellent relations with 
the Coptic Church patriarch, Pope Shenouda III, and said that 
all Egyptians should be treated equally, regardless of 
religion.  In September 2007, Tantawi announced that he had 
no objection to Christians studying at Al Azhar, a position 
he repeated during the meeting.
