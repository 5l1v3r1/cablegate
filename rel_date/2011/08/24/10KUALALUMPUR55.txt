REF: STATE 6355 -- OUTREACH ON LONDON CONFERENCE 
 
(SBU) Poloff discussed talking points (reftel) with Mr. Mohd 
Hussain Abu Bakr, Principal Assistant Secretary in the MFA's 
South and Central Asia Division, on January 25.  According to 
Hussain, Malaysia would be represented by Foreign Minister 
Anifah Aman at the London conference.  Hussain commented that 
Malaysia "is willing to continue its current program" of 
supporting Afghanistan by providing training to its civil 
servants, specifically in the fields of IT, education, public 
and civil service administration, and diplomacy.  Hussain did 
not indicate to Poloff any intent by the GOM to increase its 
current assistance or to conduct any of its training in 
Afghanistan, policy options which senior officials in the 
Ministry of Defense and at the Malaysian Embassy in 
Washington have been indicating are under active GOM 
consideration.  This past week, Ministry of Defense contacts 
told DAO that the GOM plans to send defense officials to 
Afghanistan to review and conduct reconnaissance on 
appropriate GOM assistance to Afghanistan, but did not 
mention a specific time line for dispatching this team. 
(Comment: We find it somewhat troubling that the MFA action 
officer for Afghanistan is seemingly unaware of any recent 
discussions about Malaysia ramping up its assistance to 
Afghanistan, but this could possibly be explained by the fact 
that most of these conversations have been conducted outside 
MFA channels.  Post recommends a senior-level pull-aside with 
FM Anifah and his team in London to confirm Malaysia's 
intentions on the assistance front.  End Comment.)
