Â¶1. (SBU) We conveyed on August 21 reftel points on the U.S. 
Treasury's designation of five Iranian nuclear and missile entities 
to Gihan Indragupta, Assistant Director of UN and Multilateral 
Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and asked that the GSL seek to 
identify and freeze any assets related to these entities that may 
exist in Sri Lanka, in accordance with relevant UN Security Council 
resolutions.  Indragupta requested that we share any specific 
information the USG may have about these entities' operations in Sri 
Lanka, noting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would be inclined 
to forward any such information to the appropriate enforcement 
authorities.
