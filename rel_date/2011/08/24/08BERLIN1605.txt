SUBJECT: GERMAN RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON PAKISTAN DONORS 
CONFERENCE 
 
REF: A. STATE 124618 
     ¶B. BERLIN 1548 
 
¶1. On December 1, Econoff met with Gudrun Sraega, Head of 
Division, South Asia, Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to 
encourage German participation in the proposed December 16 
Pakistan Donors Conference in New York (ref A).  Other than a 
recent inquiry by the Japanese, Sraega said she had not been 
aware of plans for such a conference.  In response to her 
question, Econoff explained that the proposed event was 
unrelated to the activities of the Friends of Pakistan or the 
Frontier Trust Fund.  Sraega was very curious as to the level 
of U.S. participation.  She also requested more details on 
the guest list and organization of the event, which Econoff 
subsequently provided. 
 
¶2. As Sraega only learned of the conference through the 
demarche, she was unable to provide details of Germany's 
participation in the event or planned contribution.  Citing 
his busy schedule, she said she doubted Foreign Minister 
Steinmeier would be able to attend, though she did not rule 
it out.  She noted that Germany would in any event send a 
representative, but was unsure whether representation would 
come from the Foreign Ministry or Development Ministry.  She 
was pessimistic Germany would be able to make a significant 
contribution at such short notice, beyond what it has already 
committed to provide in other fora (ref B). 
 
¶3. Demarche points were also shared with contacts at the 
Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development.
