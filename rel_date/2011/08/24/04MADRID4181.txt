SUBJECT: ARAFAT'S DETERIORATING HEALTH RESPONSE - AMEMBASSY 
MADRID 
 
REF: STATE 231686 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In response to REFTEL, the Emergency Action 
Committee was consulted regarding specific security concerns 
for possible repercussions from the deteriorating health of 
Arafat.  With many EAC members already committed to outside 
meetings during the day, but understanding the necessity of a 
prompt response, the EAC was consulted through various 
"mini-meetings" as their schedules allowed.  The RSO acted as 
the liaison and conduit for all responses. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The State Department Section Head's meeting 
discussed REFTEL and concurred that no specific concerns 
exist at this time regarding the Subject.  RSO contacted ORA, 
Legat, DEA, DHS, TSA, and DAO, to discuss the implications 
and concerns for security for Mission Spain should Arafat's 
health deteriorate and all unanimously expressed the opinion 
that the situation does not currently impact on Mission.  The 
Consul General in Barcelona also provided his input stating 
that he views no particular threat or concern at this time 
generated from this topic. 
 
¶3.  (U) Mission Spain will continue to monitor the situation 
and condition of PLO Chairman Arafat and should any concerns 
arise, Mission will immediately notify the Department.
