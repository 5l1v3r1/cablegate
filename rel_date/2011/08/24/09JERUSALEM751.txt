Main Stories: 
------------- 
All dailies lead with news citing wires and Wafa that Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Abbas announced after his May 6 meeting 
with Egypt's President Mubarak in Cairo that PA Premier Fayyad of 
the PA's "resigned government" will remain in place with a "few 
additions" to the cabinet. The new members will not interfere with 
progress in national dialogue talks set for May 16 in Cairo, Abbas 
added.  Abbas also noted that Arab countries will present President 
Obama with a comprehensive peace settlement for ending Middle East 
conflict during upcoming meetings.  He stressed, "we want Israel to 
commit to the two-state solution, halt settlement expansion and 
excavations in [the Old City of] Jerusalem."  In related news, 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages an AFP story that Hamas leader Mahmud 
Zahhar hopes that unity talks will succeed and urges the "revival" 
of the Palestinian Legislative Council, "particularly because it 
enjoys a Hamas majority." 
 
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu will inform President Obama about 
his willingness to propose "self-rule" for Palestinians in the West 
Bank, according to Al-Quds' front page.  According to coverage that 
cites an Israeli daily, Netanyahu believes that the two-state 
solution cannot be achieved in the near future, noting, "we will not 
accept the two-state solution."  Al-Ayyam runs front page coverage 
citing AFP about Netanyahu chairing a future ministerial committee 
to study the issue of, "economic development for the Palestinians." 
The committee will include Israeli Foreign Minister Lieberman, 
reporting notes.  Netanyahu also announced that he will launch a 
number of economic projects in the West Bank, particularly in Jenin 
and Jericho in the near future, the paper adds.  In related news, Al 
Hayat Al Jadida front pages a photo of children in Jenin protesting 
for the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli detention. 
 
Al-Quds' front page reports that the UN fact finding committee 
investigating "Israeli violations in the recent war in Gaza," has 
requested that Israel provide more detail on an alleged secret 
detention center "1391" that was used in Gaza during the conflict to 
interrogate Palestinians.  According to coverage that cites an 
Israeli daily, Israel has denied using the center for interrogation 
purposes.  In related coverage, Al Ayyam runs a front page photo 
showing a teenager, blinded in the recent Gaza conflict, being 
assisted by his father to drink water.  The picture introduces an 
article about May 6 rocket attacks on southern Israel and Israeli 
airstrikes on Gaza tunnels. 
 
The Palestinian Authority Department of the Waqf and Antiquities 
noted on May 6 that the Israeli Antiquities Authority has opened a 
new "monument park" at the Israeli Knesset to showcase "Jewish 
history in Jerusalem," according to Al Quds' front page.  The park 
includes the Umayyad stones that were allegedly "stolen" by the 
Israeli Antiquities Authority in April, and are being presented as 
remains of the Jewish Temple Mount, reporting concludes. 
 
Arab League leaders have agreed to form a committee to push for 
emergency assistance to Gaza and reconstruction efforts there, Al 
Hayat Al Jadida's front page reports.  The committee will be chaired 
by Arab League Secretary General Musa and include members of 
specialized Arab organizations, the Wafa article notes. 
 
All front pages highlight factual, neutral reporting about the 
killing of a Palestinian shot by Israeli military near the Ibrahim 
Mosque in Hebron on May 6.  The Israeli military claim that the 
youth tried to attack an Israeli soldier and steal his weapon, the

Ma'an story notes. 
 
Al-Quds runs an inside cartoon showing Israel refusing an American 
request to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, 
"U.S. determination...but!": (05/07) "We in the Palestinian 
Territories are facing deep divisions between Fatah and Hamas; the 
West Bank and Gaza.  The divisions are being used by Israel as an 
excuse to avoid realizing the U.S. vision of a two-state solution 
and ending the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  Israel [also uses the 
excuse that] two authorities now govern the Palestinian Territories 
[Hamas and Fatah] with two different policies. Our national 
obligation as Palestinians is to end this division and try to 
confront national challenges ourselves before we resort to asking 
the international community to solve our internal problems." 
 
2) Regular columnist Talal Okal opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily 
under the title, "U.S. and Israel - What's new" (05/07): "The new 
rapprochement that Netanyahu has offered the U.S. administration 
seems to be serving Israeli interests perfectly:  U.S. officials 
[Kerry and Biden] have called for normalization of relations with 
Israel in return for Israel halting settlement expansion. Netanyahu 
is also taking advantage of this rapprochement to encourage both 
official and closet allies in moderate Arab countries to join Israel 
in facing [the Iranian threat]."
