SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT ZIM'S ELECTION TO COMMISSION ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS; HARARE 
 
 
¶1.   Under headline "Another victory over Britain," the 
   government-controlled daily "The Herald" dedicated 
   its May 2 editorial to hailing Zimbabwe's election 
   to the Geneva-based Commission on Human Rights as 
   "an intrepid demonstration of the international 
   community's confidence in the country," adding that 
   Zimbabwe's election was also a "victory over 
   Britain and its allies who have ganged up to 
   demonize" Mr. Mugabe's government. 
 
¶2.   "The election of Zimbabwe to the influential 15- 
   member Geneva-based Commission on Human Rights is an 
   intrepid demonstration of the international community's 
   confidence in the country and its role in international 
   affairs.  We applaud the latest victory over Britain 
   and its allies who have ganged up to demonize the 
   government and President Mugabe.  The election is 
   recognition of Zimbabwe's respect for human rights and 
   democracy.  It has also over-ridden the erroneous 
   impression of a pariah state that has been portrayed by 
   the Western media and some governments. . .  The latest 
   British defeat means that alleged human rights abuses 
   in Zimbabwe will not be used as a weapon to tarnish the 
   image of the country. . .  Zimbabwe now needs to use 
   its position on the 15-member commission to be the 
   voice of the voiceless that have endured untold 
   suffering at the hands of the same forces that seek to 
   entrench their dominance on the earth.  We hope that 
   sense will finally prevail and those tormenting 
   Zimbabwe will realize that their sinister actions have 
   been exposed.  The only way for them to save face would 
   be to join the other nations in rallying behind 
   Zimbabwe's efforts to redistribute land."
