¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Sultan of Ternate positioned himself as 
the mediator of the continuing North Maluku gubernatorial 
dispute during a January 25 meeting with Surabaya Principal 
Officer.  Ternate, the capital of North Maluku, was calm after 
the January 23 Supreme Court ruling that supported former 
Governor Thaib Armaiyn's re-election as Governor.  The Sultan 
combines his 40-year royal tenure with his democratically 
elected seat in the national Parliament to wield significant 
authority and influence in North Maluku.  End summary.

North Maluku Election Saga Continues; Thaib Gains Ground 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶2. (U) On January 23, the Supreme Court ruled that the North 
Maluku Election Commission -- not the National Election 
Commission -- had jurisdiction to determine the winner of the 
disputed North Maluku gubernatorial election.  The Supreme Court 
decision generated only minor protests in Ternate, but no 
violence or unrest was apparent during our January 23-25 visit. 
On November 16, the North Maluku Election Commission ruled that 
Thaib Armaiyn won the North Maluku governorship; however, the 
National Election Commission ruled on November 22 that 
Golkar-supported Abdul Gafur won the flawed election (see 
reftels).  This election saga is not complete as the National 
Election Committee vowed to file judicial review at the Supreme 
Court.  Timbul Sugianta is currently the Acting Governor.  Thaib 
Armaiyn is supported by the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), 
National Awakening Party (PKB), the Democratic Party (PD), and 
the Crescent Star Party (PBB).  Thaib is accused by local NGOs 
of corruption totaling Rp 54 billion ($6 million) during his 
previous tenure as North Maluku governor.  Abdul Gafur, a former 
Suharto-era minister, is supported by Golkar and the National 
Mandate Party (PAN).

The Sultan of Ternate: The Royal Democrat 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Sultan of Ternate combines imperial authority 
through his role as Sultan with the democratic credential of 
serving as one of four North Maluku MPs in the national 
parliament.  A self-declared "Sultan of the people," Haji 
Mudzhaffar Shah II acknowledged his limited authority and 
symbolic function as Sultan of Ternate.  However, he also framed 
his authority as Sultan as a power given to him by the people, 
noting that the people could remove him from power if they 
protested his rule.  The Sultan described his reign as a 
"different form of democracy," stating that Ternate has 
practiced decentralization for over 800 years with the Sultanate 
holding significant power as local authority. 
 
------------------------- 
The Sultan as Peacemeaker 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Sultan also promoted himself as the gatekeeper of 
North Maluku for economic and political affairs.  The Sultan 
said that his permission was a pre-requisite for doing business 
in the region.  He also presented himself as the most effective 
peacemaker of the ongoing gubernatorial election. The North 
Maluku Election Commission had denied his attempt to register as 
a candidate for last November's election, sparking 
demonstrations from his followers.  He described the 
gubernatorial candidates as waiting in limbo, explicitly stating 
that he alone could resolve the matter.  The Sultan's proposed 
answer to the electoral strife hinged on his ability to run in a 
new round of elections, which he fully expected to win, but 
which do not have any legal basis to occur.  He said supported a 
strong military and police role in North Maluku.  Although the 
Sultan will likely not be the next North Maluku governor, his 
societal position and access to resources gives him a strong 
position to influence the election and overall political 
environment in North Maluku.
