TIP CONFERENCE 
 
REFTEL: STATE 197226 
 
¶1.  (U) On December 11, POLOFF delivered reftel 
demarche seeking GOA representation at the 
international conference on trafficking in persons 
hosted by the UAE and UN Office on Drugs and Crime. 
According to a contact at the MFA?s Office of UN 
Affairs, the MFA had received an invitation to the 
conference but was concerned that no funding was 
provided for transportation costs. Poloff conveyed 
reftel talking points that the USG unfortunately did 
not have funds to support travel costs since this is 
not a USG-planned conference. 
 
¶2.  (U) In a separate meeting with the MFA Director 
for Human Rights and Women?s Affairs, Zohra Rasekh, 
Poloff mentioned the conference.  Rasekh indicated 
that her office would usually take the lead in GOA 
participation in conferences on human trafficking and 
that she would be very much interested in attending. 
She noted, however, that the MFA Office for UN Affairs 
had not passed the invitation on to her.  Poloff 
shared with her the conference details and stressed 
the USG?s interest in GOA participation, as 
Afghanistan is both a source country for human 
trafficking.
