DELEGATIONS TO TRILATERAL TO EMBRACE PLANNED 
DELIVERABLES IN AGRICULTURE 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action cable (ref para 3).  A response 
is requested by May 3. 
 
¶2. (U) The U.S. ? Afghanistan ? Pakistan Trilateral 
Summit on May 6 and 7 in Washington will bring together 
senior leaders to discuss critical issues that affect 
the stability of the entire region.  Agriculture has 
been identified by the Special Representative to 
Afghanistan and Pakistan Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, 
as one of the top three issues where we need to make 
progress.  An agricultural breakout session chaired by 
Secretary Vilsack will identify activities that can be 
undertaken by the three governments together to improve 
productivity and employment in the region's agricultural 
sector. 
 
¶3.  (U) A priority deliverable for the agriculture break 
out session is establishment of trilateral bodies to 
address "Strengthening Food Security through Research 
and Application" and "Water Management and Watershed 
Rehabilitation."  S/SRAP requests posts to contact their 
respective ministers of agriculture in Afghanistan and 
Pakistan to urge them to agree to an announcement by the 
three Presidents that these bodies are being 
established.  A response is requested by May 3. 
 
¶4.  (U) The trilateral body on "Strengthening Food 
Security through Research and Application,"  would 
establish a board to coordinate agricultural research 
efforts among the three countries.  Research efforts 
could focus on: (1) improving per-hectare productivity 
for key food, feed, and forage crops; (2) improving 
storage systems to reduce post-harvest losses for key 
food crops; (3) developing systems to detect and control 
crop and livestock diseases; and (4)deepening 
collaboration on UG-99 (stem rust) research and 
development of practical solutions. 
 
¶5.  (U) The trilateral body for "Water Management and 
Watershed Rehabilitation" would identify areas for 
collaboration on rehabilitating target watersheds and 
utilizing improved irrigation practices and technologies 
to increase agricultural crop yields. 
 
¶6.  (U) Points of contact in S/SRAP are Beth Dunford, 
Senior Development Advisor to the Special 
Representative, (202)647-9403, and Otto Gonzalez, 
Agriculture Advisor, (202)647-4131.
