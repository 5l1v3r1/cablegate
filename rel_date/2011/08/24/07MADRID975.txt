Â¶1. (SBU) ESTOFF and POLOFF delivered reftel points on May 18 
to MFA Disarmament Affairs Deputy Director General Ignacio 
Sanchez and MFA Counselor for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and 
Disarmament Carlos Torres, conveying Department views on the 
need to interpret broadly operative Paragraph 5 of UNSCR 1747 
that prohibits Iran's supply, sale, or transfer of "any arms 
or related material."  Sanchez said that the Government of 
Spain is in agreement with the U.S. definition of Paragraph 5 
and agreed that the key tenets of 1747 should be "applied 
broadly."  Sanchez also agreed with EMBOFFs assertion of the 
importance of strong, consistent standards in implementing 
1747 by all UN member states.
