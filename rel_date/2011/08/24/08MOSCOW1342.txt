¶1. (SBU) Per reftel request, we discussed Russia's progress in 
implementing the International Health Regulations (IHR) with Deputy 
Director Oleg Chestnov of the Health and Social Development 
Ministry's International Department, and with Aleksandr Kucherenko, 
head of the International Department at the Federal Surveillance 
Service for Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being 
(Rospotrebnadzor).  Chestnov welcomed the checklist of steps that 
the USG would be taking to implement the IHR in the United States. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Chestnov and Kucherenko confirmed that Rospotrebnadzor 
would be responsible for Russia's IHR implementation.  Chief Medical 
Officer and Rospotrebnadzor Head Gennadiy Onishchenko issued a 
decree in May 2007 tasking Rospotrebnadzor with managing Russia's 
IHR implementation, including coordination with other Russian 
ministries and agencies that would be affected by the IHR, such as 
customs, law enforcement and border control services. 
Rospotrebnadzor is in the process of developing guidelines for the 
IHR's implementation.  Kucherenko stated that Rospotrebnadzor has 
conducted five meetings with health officials from Russia's regions 
and from other CIS countries regarding Russia's implementation, 
including three meetings in which representatives from the World 
Health Organization's (WHO) European Office participated.  Officials 
from Rospotrebnadzor also will participate in a WHO-sponsored 
meeting on the IHR in Hamburg, Germany May 26-28.
