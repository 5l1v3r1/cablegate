SUBJECT: INITIAL FRENCH COMMENTS RE IAEA COMMITTEE ON 
SAFEGUARDS AND VERIFICATION 
 
REF: STATE 159113 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We presented August 30 reftel talking points and 
non-paper to MFA action officer for IAEA issues Hugues de 
Longevialle.  He confirmed that he was aware of the June IAEA 
decision to establish a committee on Safeguards and 
Verification, but noted that the MFA had not had an 
opportunity to develop a French position, especially given 
that many officials have been on summer leave.  He welcomed 
our non-paper, adding that the MFA looked forward to using it 
as a basis for a French action plan.  De Longevialle said he 
would share with us some initial French thoughts on the 
issue, hopefully as early as next week. 
 
¶2. (U) BIO NOTE: De Longevialle informed us that he has been 
assigned to replace Veronique Vouland as Francois Richier's 
deputy in the MFA's Disarmament office.  Richier remains the 
DAS-equivalent director of the office.
