SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DICARLO MEETS WITH ICTR PRESIDENT 
DENNIS BYRON AND DISCUSSES PENSIONS FOR AD LITEM JUDGES 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request, see paragraph three below. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Judge Dennis Byron, President of the International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and his special assistant 
Helge Zietler met with Ambassador DiCarlo on October 6 to 
provide their views on the issue of whether the ICTR's ad 
litem judges should be eligible for a UN pension.   Byron 
said that there are eight ad litem judges serving at the ICTR 
who have more than three years of service and are currently 
ineligible for a pension.  He said that some of these judges 
will eventually work longer than some of the ICTR's permanent 
judges and should be eligible for a pension and asked for 
U.S. support.  Byron also conveyed that the situation will 
have an adverse impact on the ICTR's completion strategy as 
some of the ad litem judges need to return home to work in 
order to preserve retirement benefits there.  As a fix, he 
noted that if they were eligible for a UN pension that covers 
the years they are serving at the ICTR, they would be more 
likely to continue to serve until the ICTR finishes its work. 
 Ambassador DiCarlo said that she would convey the concern to 
the Department but emphasized that the terms under which the 
ad litems were hired did not include the benefit of a UN 
pension and said it would be difficult to make adjustments at 
this point. 
 
¶3.  (U)  USUN requests the Department's position on the 
ICTR's request prior to December 4 when the ICTR and ICTY 
Presidents are scheduled to return to New York to brief the 
Security Council.
