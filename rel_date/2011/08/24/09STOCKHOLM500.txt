MESSAGING 
 
REF: A. STATE 83031 
     ¶B. STATE 63551 
 
¶1. The Swedish EU Presidency is working to develop an EU 
statement -- "a political blessing" -- to be released in 
conjunction with the August 20 elections in Afghanistan, MFA 
Afghanistan Desk Director Mathias Otterstedt told Poloffs 
August 11.  Otterstedt, who had accompanied FM Bildt to 
Afghanistan at the end of July, said three points will be 
emphasized: 
 
-- Credible elections represent a chance for the Afghan 
people to take part in democracy; 
 
-- Complaints of fraud and election irregularities will be 
noted and taken seriously; 
 
-- Afghanistan's election commission and other authorities 
should act responsibly and in an unbiased manner. 
 
Otterstedt indicated that these points could be coordinated 
with U.S. messaging, if there were areas of overlap 
(reftels).  Otterstedt also said that a coordinated press 
strategy by the U.S. and EU would be important before the EU 
election observers made their first public reports, probably 
on August 22.  He suggested such coordination take place in 
Brussels and Kabul, as well as in capitals. 
 
¶2. Action Request: Post seeks Department guidance on Swedish 
requests for a coordinated press strategy.
