SUBJECT: USAID AND TIKA PUSH FOR TRILATERAL COOPERATION 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary. In an October 6 meeting on the sidelines 
of the IMF/WB summit with the leadership of Turkey's aid and 
development organization, TIKA, the members of the USAID 
delegation discussed food security in Central Asia and 
Africa. They also discussed opportunities for trilateral 
cooperation involving universities and NGOs from Turkey and 
the United States in third country projects.  USAID's 
Assistant Administrator for Africa Franklin Moore emphasized 
the long-term relationships built and maintained in such 
trilateral projects - relationships that continue long after 
the initial funding from international organizations ends. 
USAID's Coordinator for Bilateral and Multilateral Affairs 
Norm Nicholson also addressed the anticipated follow-up from 
SRAP Holbrooke's office on a recent meeting on 
Afghanistan/Pakistan in Washington. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Food Security in Africa:  TIKA President Musa 
Kulaklikaya introduced TIKA's activities in Africa, spanning 
food security, climate change, poverty, health, and capacity 
building.  The development organization's Africa programs 
constitute 20 percent of TIKA's budget and its African 
Agricultural Development program operates in 13 countries 
(Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Guinea Bissau, Mali, 
Senegal, Comoros Islands, Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya, 
Rwanda, and Uganda) although TIKA only has offices in 
Ethiopia, Senegal, and Sudan.  In the realm of food security, 
the program focuses on forestry, fisheries, food production 
and packaging. Kulaklikaya emphasized a focus on capacity 
building in areas of weakness and the implementation of small 
and medium-sized projects. An example of such an SMP is the 
agricultural training of 235 people in Sudan over the last 
two years.  TIKA's work in Africa also addresses vocational 
training - providing one to three months of training; potable 
water and bore holes; and providing health services.  TIKA 
has treated close to 100,000 people over the last three years 
in over 37 African countries through its projects in the 
region. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Central Asian Priority: The remaining 80 percent of 
TIKA's budget is spent largely in the Balkans, Central Asia, 
and the Middle East, with agriculture, health and 
e-Governance capacity building constituting the majority of 
its efforts in the regions.  Moore agreed with Kulaklikaya's 
sentiment that Central Asian food security is of extreme 
concern and he congratulated TIKA's initiative to work in a 
place that attracted few donors.  Kulaklikaya listed among 
TIKA's projects agricultural training projects in 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan as well as agricultural and 
fisheries projects in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. He noted 
noting that it cooperates with the Swedish International 
Development Agency in that region. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Trilateral Cooperation:  Moore proposed greater 
trilateral cooperation with Turkey and the U.S. through joint 
projects between the country's respective civil society or 
universities in third countries.  Moore and Kulaklikaya  both 
agreed that packaging and food security were two areas in 
which trilateral work would be easiest and most effective. 
Moore asked what links existed between US and Turkish 
universities and suggested exploiting existing links and 
promoting additional inks for trilateral work in Ethiopia or 
Sudan, for example.  Moore emphasized that the importance of 
such projects lies in the relationship that continues after 
the initial funding from international organizations ends. 
While agreeing that such relationships were crucial to 
international development, Kulaklikaya made an effort to note 
that the relationship between USAID and TIKA in Uzbekistan 
was "very bad" because TIKA did not receive the contribution 
anticipated from USAID.  Moore promised to follow up and see 
how both sides 
could nurture a better relationship. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Afghanistan:  Nicholson explained to Kulaklikaya 
that he was waiting for a response to the recent meeting on 
Afghanistan/Pakistan from SRAP Holbrooke's office. 
Kulaklikaya noted that Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu met 
with SRAP Holbrooke in New York and looks forward to the 
follow up. Nichsolson added that he, too, would like Kabul's 
response to a list of proposed projects.
