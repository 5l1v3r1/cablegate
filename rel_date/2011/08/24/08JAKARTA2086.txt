SUBJECT: INDONESIA - WIDJAJA DISCUSSION ON SAMPLE SHARING 
 
1.(SBU) Dr. Widjaja Lukito, Senior Advisor to the Minister of Health 
told us on November 11 that Ministry of Health officials are 
concerned that the current U.S. administration may no longer have a 
role in sample sharing discussions and in the World Health 
Organization Intergovernmental Meeting scheduled in December. 
Widjaja asked whether President-elect Obama's transition team would 
be represented at the IGM meeting and whether they would be involved 
in sample sharing discussions.  We advised that the current 
administration remains in charge of United States policy until the 
Presidential inauguration on January 20.  It was in United States 
and Indonesia's mutual interests to resolve remaining differences on 
our sample sharing positions before the IGM lest the issue drag on 
throughout much of 2009.  We noted that the current U.S. team 
involved in sample sharing discussions is well-versed on the issue, 
while the transition team had not yet focused on sample sharing. We 
also emphasized that a new Secretary of Health and Human Services 
would likely prefer to start a relationship based on positive 
partnership opportunities. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Widjaja remarked that upon a cursory review, the 
Indonesians felt that our draft Materials Transfer Agreement (MTA) 
presented at the September 21-22 meeting in Manila did not appear to 
reflect discussions from the July 25-27 meeting in Sydney.  Widjaja 
noted that the Indonesians would be meeting on November 18-19 to 
thoroughly go over our draft material transfer agreement and other 
documents provided and would provide us with official feedback.  He 
expressed openness to the possibility of conducting a digital video 
conference during the week of November 24, to resolve remaining 
issues. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Widjaja advised that a number of the countries represented 
through the Third World Network were suspicious of the 
U.S.-Indonesian side meetings on sample sharing.  He planned to meet 
with these countries a day before the IGM meeting in order to 
alleviate concerns.
