¶1. (U) SUMMARY.  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GVN) has a 
comprehensive prevention and control approach for avian and pandemic 
influenza (AI) based on a national surveillance system in the 
developing world context.  The approach integrates both animal and 
human health sectors.  The GVN leadership and management structure 
effectively reaches all levels of government, from the Prime 
Minster's office down to the district commune.  The approach is 
based on a national plan, which specifically addresses preparedness. 
 The plan is aggressive by international standards and has proven 
effective during recurring animal and human outbreaks over recent 
years.  The implementation now falls under a partnership framework 
between the National Steering Committee for Avian Influenza (GVN) 
and international partners through a Vietnam Partnership for Avian 
and Human Pandemic Influenza (PAHI), established in November 2006. 
HHS/CDC has a cooperative agreement, which includes effort to 
provide technical assistance to update this type of planning. 
Experience with SARS provided momentum for building AI preparedness. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) The national plan is contained in two documents: Vietnam's 
Integrated National Plan for Avian Influenza Control and Human 
Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response, 2006-2008 (also known 
as the "Red Book") and The Vietnam Integrated National Operational 
Programme for Avian and Human Influenza (OPI), 2006-2010 (known as 
the "Green Book" See: http://www.avianinfluenza.org.vn (under 
"resources," under "documents," accessed 04/11/2007). 
 
¶3. (U) The GVN has conducted and participated in pandemic response 
exercises at the national and international regional level.  See 
list below.  It has trained rapid response teams at national, 
provincial, and district levels.  On the human health side, hospital 
staff has been trained in detection, diagnosis, and management of 
influenza suspects.  There has been some effort to upgrade capacity 
(i.e., equipment and staff training) and to deal with respiratory 
failure (e.g., in the use of ventilators and oxygen, planned 
training on personal protective equipment).  Preparation and 
response also characterizes the animal health side.  The approach 
includes systems for early detection, reporting, rapid response with 
compensated culling, isolation, quarantine, and the implementation 
of a comprehensive poultry immunization program.  Regulations for 
safer poultry rearing, slaughtering and marketing are in place and 
longer term industry reforms are moving forward.  Vietnam is taking 
an increasingly important regional role in training and support. 
Multi-agency USG support, both technical and financial, to the GVN 
and the assistance of other international partners has contributed 
substantially to Vietnam's preparedness capacity. 
 
¶4. (U) The list of trainings and exercises should be put in the 
context of the chronology of six "waves" of animal AI outbreaks 
(12/2003, 4/2004, 12/2004, 10/2005, 12/2006, and 3/2007) and 
 
HANOI 00000687  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
confirmed human cases were related to the first four waves. 
Further, the trainings should be understood in the context major 
communications efforts on the part of the GVN (some examples include 
01/28/04: Prime Minister issued the decision No 13/2004 QD-TTg to 
establish the National Steering committee for AI control and 
prevention; 2004: 64 Provincial Steering Committees for AI Control 
and Prevention were established; 11/2006: Establishment of 
Partnership on Avian and Human Influenza (PAHI); 12/22/06: Urgent 
message 2119/CD-TTg by Prime Minister to direct authorities to 
control AI). 
 
¶5. (U) The list of trainings and exercises below includes the date, 
title (location or frequency), and if available, estimated total 
number of participants and sponsor. This is partial list.  There is 
no known centralized catalogue for this data.  The data was 
collected by Post from Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of 
Agricultural and Rural Development (MARD), and Vietnamese and 
English language press.
