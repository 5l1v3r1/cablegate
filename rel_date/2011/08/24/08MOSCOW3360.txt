¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Russian Federal 
Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance 
Service (VPSS) informed via official letter on 
November 14, 2008, that another U.S. poultry 
plant (P-13556) and pork plant (#17564) will be 
delisted as of November 24, 2008.  According to 
the VPSS letter, routine tests revealed the 
presence of tetracycline in a shipment of 
chicken quarters and salmonella in a shipment 
of boneless pork jowls from these plants.  The 
letter requests that the USDA Food Safety and 
Inspection Service (FSIS) conduct an 
investigation into how product contaminated 
with residue and salmonella found their way 
into shipments to Russia.  The original scanned 
copy of the VPSS letter and courtesy 
translation were sent to FSIS on November 16, 
¶2008.  An informal embassy translation of the 
letter follows.  END SUMMARY.
