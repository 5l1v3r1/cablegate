Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Panjshir Governor Bahlul and NDS Director 
Saleh, both Panjshiris, have feuded recently, throwing 
light not only on their personal differences but also 
on Panjshiri cohesiveness.  When matters threatened to 
boil over, Panjshiri heavyweights stepped in to close 
ranks.  The episode is revealing:  Panjshiris are a 
close-knit sub-population and insist that internal 
conflicts "stay in the family."  End Summary. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A running feud between Panjshiri Governor 
Bahlul and NDS Director Saleh, both Panjshiris, flared 
up in May and continues to simmer.  Both accuse the 
other of treachery in connection with a jailbreak on 
May 16 in Panjshir involving NDS personnel.  Putting 
aside the disputed details of the episode, their clash 
is revealing about the Panjshiris in several ways. 
 
Foreground 
---------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Their quarrel is personal, and is, at heart, 
about differing styles:  Bahlul, the rough-hewn former 
mujahideen, against Saleh, the young English-speaking 
sophisticate.  A touchstone in Panjshiri politics is 
whether someone served as a commander during the 
struggles against the Soviets and Taliban.  Bahlul 
did; Saleh did not.  The split is partly generational, 
although Bahlul is only a half-dozen years older, he 
appeals to the older, more traditional Panjshiris, 
while Saleh works with the younger Panjshiris in 
Kabul. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Their differences are not ideological and do 
not extend to questions concerning PRT activities or 
provincial development.  Bahlul and Saleh both support 
the PRT and believe the province is headed in the 
right direction.  The PRT maintains close ties with 
the Governor and sees Saleh occasionally when he 
visits his home (near the PRT office).  Last year, as 
the PRT was poised to establish itself in the valley, 
Saleh had a long talk with PRT officers.  His main 
points - honor Panjshiri pride, recognize Panjshiri 
contributions, respect local tradition - would also 
gain easy endorsement from the Governor. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Intervention was necessary.  Panjshiri 
heavyweights had to induce Bahlul and Saleh to bury 
the hatchet.  According to our contacts, those 
Panjshiris who intervened were Meshrano Jerga member 
Fahim Khan, VP Massoud and Wolesi Jerga Speaker 
Qanooni.  Of the three, Fahim Khan was the most active 
in promoting reconciliation.  He stepped in to finance 
a new mosque in Bazarak, next to the Governor's 
temporary office in Panjshir, reportedly at a cost of 
135,000 USD.  He told Panjshiris the construction was 
meant to symbolize renewal, both in personal and 
provincial terms. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Panjshiris closed ranks.  Several large 
gatherings, in Kabul and in Panjshir, took place to 
 
KABUL 00003260  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
offer public support to a Bahlul-Saleh reconciliation. 
To this end, 200 former mujahideen congregated at the 
Kabul Intercontinental in late May; and over 100 
locals met in Panjshir in early June.  Fahim Khan told 
us it was important that the two shook hands in front 
of fellow Panjshiris (which they did at the Kabul 
Intercontinental). 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The dispute was "a family affair."  This 
description, from the Governor, suggests the tight- 
knit nature of Panjshiri society.  When matters 
threatened to boil over, the Panjshiris resolved to 
settle the issue internally.  They wanted to avoid 
showing cracks in their group to the outside world. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Neither Bahlul nor Saleh lost his job 
because of the spat, however, as both are deemed too 
important.  But someone, evidently, had to go.  The 
"fall guy" turned out to be the local NDS chief in 
Panjshir, Habib Rahman, who was replaced by Mohammed 
Salem.  One of our contacts said that Rahman 
"mishandled the dispute and had to be released." 
 
¶9.  (SBU) There are two Panjshiri populations:  one is 
in the province itself, and the other has relocated to 
Kabul.  The latter group comprises the political class 
(including Fahim Kahn, Massoud, Qanooni and Saleh 
himself), as well as many young men seeking jobs in 
the capital.  The Bahlul-Saleh spat threw into relief 
the province-capital split.  Bridge-builders -- those 
who can operate in both places -- are necessary to 
prevent the gap from widening. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU) The Bahlul-Saleh feud is revealing, not 
only about their personal differences, but also about 
the Panjshiri cohesiveness.  Bahlul and Saleh will 
never be close.  At the moment, they are scarcely on 
speaking terms.  But the notion of a Panjshiri family 
prevailed - and now has a monument:  A new mosque, now 
under construction, in the center of Bazarak that will 
accommodate over 1,000 souls.
