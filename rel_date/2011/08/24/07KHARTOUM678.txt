Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) From February 25 to 28, a joint USAID Office of U.S. Foreign 
Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) and Office of Transition 
Initiatives (USAID/OTI) assessment team traveled to Abyei and 
Southern Kordofan State to monitor USAID-funded water interventions, 
identify potential conflict-mitigation activities, and evaluate 
regional water needs. According to USAID partners, a more robust 
non-governmental organization (NGO) presence and strengthened 
capacity is required to address expanding needs in the region due to 
the influx of displaced population returns.  In addition, the 
rapidly changing political environment presents significant 
programming challenges. 
 
---------- 
Background 
----------- 
 
¶2. (U) Between February 25 and 28, a joint USAID assessment team 
composed of USAID/OTI Three Areas program manager, USAID/OFDA water 
and sanitation advisor, northern Sudan program officer, and 
internally displaced person (IDP) specialist traveled to Abyei and 
Southern Kordofan State.  The team met with USAID partners, NGOs, UN 
agencies, and government representatives to monitor USAID-funded 
programs and assess current and projected regional water needs in 
light of the ongoing influx of IDP returns.  For Fiscal Year (FY) 
2007, USAID/OFDA and USAID/OTI are working together closely to 
develop appropriate conflict-mitigation interventions in the Three 
Areas. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Returning IDP Populations Increase Regional Needs 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (U) The ongoing returns process of displaced populations to Abyei 
and Southern Kordofan is straining existing resources and placing 
greater assistance demands on NGOs operating in the region. 
According to the UN Mission in Sudan/Relief Rehabilitation and 
Reintegration (UNMIS/RRR), an estimated 60,000 IDPs returned to 
Abyei area between July 2005 and December 2006.  Although 
UN-assisted returns to Abyei have been placed on hold due to the 
absence of a recognized government authority in the area, an 
estimated 35,000 spontaneous returnees are expected to return during 
the current dry season.  USAID partners expressed concern that 
present programming levels are inadequate to meet the existing and 
projected needs of returning populations. 
 
¶4. (U) Limited returnee tracking and reporting have also hindered 
efforts to effectively program assistance to meet the needs of the 
returnees.  However, the recent establishment of three returnee 
tracking points in Agok, Malual leu, and Abyei by the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) and the implementation of a 
village-based tracking system coordinated through community leaders 
by South Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (SRRC) are 
expected to significantly improve available returnee data. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Political and Security Situation Hinders NGO Operations 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶5. (U) Insecurity and the fluid and tenuous political situation in 
Abyei represent significant challenges to NGO operations.  The 
ongoing absence of consensus on the Abyei border demarcations 
continues to undermine security and stability in the area.  In 
addition, the absence of an established government presence has 
created a power vacuum.  Parallel initiatives are seeking to develop 
a practical administrative solution and establish a government 
presence in the area, including ongoing dialogue between Dinka and 
Missiriya community members, UNMIS, and the UN Development Program 
(UNDP)-funded consortium, Abyei Recovery and Rehabilitation Program 
(ARRP).  The establishment of a commissioner's office in Abyei and 
the appointment of a focal point for the education sector represent 
tentative signs of progress.  However, the increasing movement of 
people into contested areas, growing shared disillusionment with the 
Government of National Unity (GNU) by the Dinka and Missiriya ethnic 
groups, and the GNU prohibition of UNMIS movement outside of UNMIS 
camps continue to fuel insecurity concerns in the region.

Water and Sanitation 
--------------------

¶6. (U) USAID staff visited the villages of Rumamer, Majack, and 
Mabok to monitor USAID-funded water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) 
interventions and assess current WASH conditions.  USAID partners 
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and Save the Children/US (SC/US) are 
expanding access to clean water through the construction of 107 
borehole wells in the region.  However, efforts to address poor 
sanitation conditions resulting from limited latrine infrastructure 
have encountered obstacles.  The region's unstable soil structure 
requires lining latrine pits with concrete, estimated at USD 500 per 
family latrine, to prevent collapse.  In addition to being 
expensive, this has led to the latrines being used as household 
storage facilities instead of their intended purpose.  Furthermore, 
increased numbers of returnee and transit populations are straining 
limited existing sanitation infrastructure. 
 
¶7. (U) Insecurity and deforestation also contribute to challenges 
confronting NGO water interventions in the region.  Deforestation 
and Lake Kailak's recession rate are depleting the aquifer and 
negatively impacting future water availability.  Local communities 
attribute regional environmental degradation to oil and mining 
company activities, which has resulted in increased tensions. 
Enhanced communication and coordination between all actors engaged 
in assistance activities, including Chinese oil companies operating 
in the region, is needed to avoid gaps and duplication in program 
coverage.  In addition, insecurity attributed to ongoing tensions 
between the Dinka and Missiriya has reduced the access and number of 
humanitarian agencies operating in the area.  A USAID-funded SC/US 
water reservoir project has repeatedly been delayed due to concerns 
over increased ethnic tensions resulting from proposed site 
locations.
