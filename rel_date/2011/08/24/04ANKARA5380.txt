(U) Classified by Ambassador Eric S. Edelman.  Reasons 1.4 
(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) MFA Disarmament Department Head Bulent Meric contacted 
EXBS Advisor on September 20 to inform him that the GOT had 
decided to not send a delegation to the Newport, Rhode Island 
PSI exercise next week.  Meric explained that after 
considering the negative US response to Turkey's request to 
join the PSI Core Group (ref B), Ankara had decided to limit 
its participation in PSI to Turkey's region (i.e., 
Mediterranean, Middle East, Caucasus, Balkans).  This did not 
diminish Turkey's commitment to PSI, he continued, and the 
geographic limitation of Turkey's involvement could be 
reconsidered if Turkey were admitted to the Core Group or if 
that body ceased to exist. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment: We had heard over a week ago that a decision 
along these lines might be coming.  We tried to convince the 
Turks to refrain from taking any action until Washington had 
had time to consider the GOT's reaction to our points on 
Turkey and the Core Group (ref A).  Unfortunately, they did 
not wait.  We expect MFA and perhaps TGS will explain this 
decision further to visiting OSD/ISA DASD Brzezinski during 
his meetings on September 22.  End Comment.
