Government spokesman Nasser Judeh welcomed the U.S. 
initiative on the Iranian nuclear program during a press 
conference on June 1.  Judeh said the GoJ thinks the U.S. 
initiative is within the framework of Jordan's position - to 
settle the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic and 
peaceful means - and that the GoJ hoped that the U.S. 
proposal would be dealt with positively to avoid escalation 
and spare the region possible harmful consequences.
