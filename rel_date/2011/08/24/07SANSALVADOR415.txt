REF: SECSTATE 24344 
 
Â¶1.  On March 2 Econoff delivered reftel demarche and provided a copy 
of the U.S. report regarding UNSC resolution 1737 to Ministry of 
Foreign Relations Director of Multilateral Affairs Mario Rivera 
Mora.  Rivera was well aware of UNSC Resolution 1737, but to date El 
Salvador has not prepared any written response.   Rivera said he 
would convoke a meeting of the Inter Institutional Group against 
Terrorism (GRICTE), of which he is a member, to draft a report to 
the Sanctions Committee.  GRICTE is comprised of members of the 
Ministry of Foreign Relations, the National Police, Customs, the 
Ministry of Finance, and the judicial system.   It was set up as a 
means to counter terrorism in the wake of the September 11 attacks, 
but is also utilized when coordinating actions that are required by 
the UNSC.  Rivera said he would advise Econoff of any other actions 
taken by GRICTE in response to the UNSC resolution.
