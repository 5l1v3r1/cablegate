¶1. (SBU) Summary: In an October 6 meeting with Special Envoy 
Natsios, Dr. Hassan al-Turabi of Sudan's Popular Congress Party 
talked about North/South relations and Darfur possible developments. 
End of summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Al-Turabi claimed that people expected improvements in 
their lives after the peace agreement, but have not seen any. S/E 
Natsios disagreed and pointed to a number of improvements - like the 
presence of schools and teachers from Kenya there - "Improvement is 
happening, but is not noticed," he said. Turabi added that the 
expectation that the CPA would radically transform life and politics 
in Sudan had not happened and may never happen. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Al-Turabi described the situation in Sudan as "tense." He 
charged that the government rules by dictate without regard to the 
constitution. "They may listen to people, (but) then vote whatever 
they like."  He said that federalizing and decentralizing the 
country would ease the tension, adding that Darfur (problem) was 
about "decentralization." Neither the federal legislature nor state 
assemblies have real power. There is no transparency or 
accountability, the CPA could have addressed the problems of 
marginalization in all of Sudan, but instead is a vehicle for 
southern secession not democracy for all Sudan. He described Darfur 
as a "disadvantaged" area with no judicial system, no police and no 
facilities. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Al-Turabi expressed his discontent that the upcoming talks 
about Darfur will take place in Tripoli noting that Libya had a long 
history of interference in Darfur. S/E Natsios said the U.S. didn't 
choose Tripoli, but the Libyans are deeply involved in the war. "If 
we don't involve them they will undermine the process." The S/E 
added that his goal is "to have peace so we don't have another war." 
Asked if there will be a peace agreement, Al-Turabi dodged the 
question saying that the talks should include all Darfurians because 
if they don't participate, "another explosion would happen." 
 
¶5. (SBU) In response to a question from S/E Natsios if the GOS's 
power is getting stronger, Al-Turabi said that the government's 
power is becoming weaker and is very unpopular. "All the opposition 
parties have one program and that is an anti-government program." He 
noted that the government of National Unity between the NCP and SPLM 
was a failure: "this is not a coalition, this is two people put 
together in a jail cell by force." He added "I should know because 
I've been in such cells." He noted that Khartoum's writ is abandoned 
in the south, "they are independent in all but name," and the SPLM 
cared little about federal rule, "they are disconnected from the 
North and don't try to hide it." 
 
¶6. (SBU) Asked if he planned to run in the 2009 elections, Al-Turabi 
ruled out his party boycotting the elections but that he himself 
would not run for president.  He added that he wanted the younger 
generation of his party to take an active part in the elections. He 
added that the NCP had succeeded in corrupting the judiciary, police 
and local government with oil wealth. He described the recent 
extension in detention of the Mubarak al-Fadel alleged "coup Plot" 
conspirators as "completely illegal." 
 
¶7. (SBU) S/E Natsios didn't have the opportunity to clear this 
message prior to departure.
