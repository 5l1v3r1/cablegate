¶3.  Econoff and Econ Specialist visited another engaged GLOBE 
school in Przysucha, about 130 km southwest of Warsaw, on 
April 18.  The event was marked by the presence of local 
authorities who support the GLOBE program.  Following a 
series of presentations, students and guests planted a tree 
and took a tour of the school's meteorological garden.  In 
the garden students demonstrated how they take measurements 
for the GLOBE program, including minimum and maximum 
temperatures as well as precipitation. 
 
¶4.  Cultural Affairs Officer and Cultural Affairs Specialist 
attended a local Earth Day celebration in Nidzica, about 100 
km northeast of Warsaw, on April 20 and gave a presentation 
on the GLOBE program and protecting the environment.  Local 
students and officials in Nidzica entertained guests with 
song and dance.  American Citizen Services Officer also 
attended an event in Lublin and spoke about climate change to 
high school students. 
 
¶5.  Econoff and Econ Specialist also spoke at a conference of 
the directors of the schools involved in the GLOBE program, 
congratulating them on their work in inspiring students 
through GLOBE.  Econoff noted how valuable the GLOBE program 
can be to teach students to enjoy science and use it to 
protect the environment.  Also, through the GLOBE program, 
students have contact with more than 19,000 schools in over 
100 countries and can connect and share with them through 
this program.

¶7.  The involvement of the Ambassador and various Embassy 
Officers in Earth Day activities in partnership with the 
GLOBE program demonstrated strong Embassy support for the 
program and strengthened dialogue on environmental issues. 
Additionally, these events provided a chance for Embassy 
Officers to engage with more local authorities on the issues 
of climate change -- an important issue in our discussions 
with national government officials.
