INDONESIAN RESPONSE TO WILDFIRES 
 
¶1.  (U) This message was coordinated with Consulate Medan. 
 
¶2.  (U) SUMMARY:  The U.S. Army-led 2009 Disaster Response 
Exchange and Exercise (DREE), conducted in Riau Province, 
Sumatra, focused on response and prevention policies for wild 
land fires.  Riau Province is Sumatra's ground zero for such 
fires, which have been raging recently.  The DREE enhanced 
Indonesian humanitarian and disaster response capabilities 
and cooperation between the U.S. and Indonesian militaries. 
It also furthered Mission's Strategic Plan Climate and 
Biodiversity goals on carbon emissions and sustainable 
forestry management.  END SUMMARY. 
 
EXERCISE IN SUMATRA 
 
¶3.  (U) U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC) personnel conducted the 
2009 Disaster Response Exchange and Exercise DREE) for 
Indonesia in Pekanbaru, Riau Province, Sumatra, from July 27 
to 31.  The program focused on response to and prevention of 
wildfires and consisted of two days of reciprocal briefings, 
followed by two days of command post and field training 
exercises. 
 
¶4.  (U) The exercises were well-attended, with 350 Indonesian 
participants representing 33 government agencies or private 
companies.  In addition, 133 Indonesians attended the 
exchange conference.  The DREE was conducted by ten USARPAC 
personnel, and one from the Hawaii Army National Guard, one 
from Pacific Command, and one from Pacific Air Force. 
 
GOOD FOR MIL-TO-MIL COOPERATION 
 
¶5.  (U) The DREE enhanced security cooperation by creating an 
opportunity for USARPAC to interact directly with one of the 
Indonesian Army's Military Regional Commands (KODAMs). 
Likewise, it provided a forum for enhancing internal 
Indonesian cooperation among a variety of military, GOI, and 
private sector entities, all working together to test the 
Riau Provincial Governor's disaster response plan. 
 
WORKING TO CONSERVE FORESTS AND REDUCE EMISSIONS 
 
¶6.  (U) The subject matter for this DREE was chosen not only 
as a means of enhancing mil-to-mil relations and domestic 
Indonesian humanitarian assistance and disaster response 
capabilities, but also because of the environmental and 
economic impact of the problem.  Traditional slash and burn 
agricultural methods are the primary cause of wild land 
fires.  Those fires destroy cultivated plants and trees and 
cause thick smoke that creates health concerns, disrupts air 
traffic, and degrades air quality in Indonesia and 
neighboring countries. 
 
¶7.  (U) Riau Province is Sumatra's ground zero for such 
fires.  These fires have been raging recently (see septel). 
The DREE exchanges and exercises thus furthered Jakarta's 
Mission Strategic Plan Climate and Biodiversity goals of 
conserving forests and reducing carbon emissions.
