SUBJECT: FUNDING DECREE FOR ITALIAN MILITARY MISSIONS 
ABROAD: PARTICIPATION IN HUMANITARIAN AND INTERNATIONAL 
MILITARY MISSIONS 
 
¶1. March 27, the Italian Senate approved a government decree 
authorizing calendar year expenditures for "Italian 
Participation in Humanitarian and International Missions," 
all of Italy's military missions abroad  The full Italian 
language text of the decree and a detailed English summary 
are available on Embassy Rome's classified website 
(http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/eur/rome/index.cf m). Some 
highlights and clarifications are included below. 
 
¶2. The decree authorizes slightly more than 1 billion Euros 
for the Italian participation in international missions in 
calendar year 2007.  In most cases, unspent funds can be 
rolled over into 2008. 
 
-The decree covers development assistance programs in 
Afghanistan, Lebanon, Sudan and Somalia; Humanitarian, 
stabilization and reconstruction programs in Iraq  (including 
NTM-I), Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, as well as Italy's 
participation in ESDP initiatives. 
 
-The decree authorizes funds for Italy's military and police 
missions abroad: UNIFIL, ISAF, Active Endeavor, Knights of 
Malta, MSU in Kosovo, Joint Enterprise in the Balkans, 
Albania, Albania 2, ALTHEA in Bosnia-Herzegovina, TIPH 2, 
EUBAM Rafah, Darfur, EUPOL Kinshasa, UNFICYP, Albania, UNMIK, 
EUPM and EUPOL COPPS. 
 
-The decree allocates 40 million Euros of new money for 
Afghan reconstruction.  However, since the MFA has yet to 
disburse its 607 million Euros in 2007 development assistance 
budget passed by Parliament as part of the general budget in 
December, it is still unclear how much Italy's 2007 total 
assistance to Afghanistan will have increased in respect to 
previous years. 
 
-The decree provides some guidance on personnel and judicial 
issues relevant to the missions. 
 
-The decree includes 500,000 Euros for a proposed 
International Peace Conference on Afghanistan. 
 
-In article 2, the reference to the authorization of 2.8 
million Euros for Italy's participation in NATO Trust Funds 
includes 1 million Euros for the NTM-I Trust Fund. 
 
-In article 2, the 10.4 million Euros to extend military 
personnel in Iraq includes funds to cover Italian military 
personnel and related "life-support" costs involved in NTM-I, 
including a proposed additional Carabinieri component.
