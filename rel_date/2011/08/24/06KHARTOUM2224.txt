¶1.  As members of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) move in greater 
numbers to their two rally points, the UN has begun planning for 
increased humanitarian aid in these areas.  Due to instability 
caused by the LRA, there has been little assistance in the region 
surrounding Ri-Kwangba outside of Nbanga in Western Equatoria and 
Owiny-ki-Bul outside of Parajok in Eastern Equatoria.  The UN wants 
to use the calm surrounding the cessation of hostilities to begin 
services to these neglected areas, and to help allay the residents' 
fears regarding their new neighbors. 
 
¶2.  The UN is also hoping it will be able to separate the 
vulnerables and non-combatants from the LRA force once it assembles, 
although LRA leader Joseph Kony has indicated this is unlikely. 
There are currently reports of nearly 400 LRA members approaching 
Owiny-ki-Bul, and fighters have already started to assemble in 
Ri-Kwangba.  The UN expects a total of 1500 LRA members to go to 
Owiny-ki-bul, and another 500 to travel to Ri-Kwangba. 
 
¶3.  Meanwhile, talks have stalled over a demand by LRA commander 
Vincent Otti to address immediately the issue of the International 
Criminal Court (ICC) indictments.  The talks had been set to discuss 
the second agenda item, which covers comprehensive solutions to 
social inequities.  LRA negotiators also protested the arrival of 
two maimed LRA victims at the talks.  Earlier, Gulu District 
Chairman Norbert Mao had told Embassy Officials that he brought the 
victims -- one missing a hand and the other missing her lips -- 
because they had a message of reconciliation that he thought would 
encourage the peace process.
