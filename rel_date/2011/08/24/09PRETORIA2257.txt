REF: STATE 112828 
 
¶1.  On November 3, poloff made phone contact with Pitso 
Montwedi, Chief Director for Human Rights and Humanitarian 
Affairs at the South African Department of International 
Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), to advise of the U.S. 
message (reftel).  Mr. Montwedi was engaged in meetings in 
New York, but he agreed to receive talking points by fax at 
the South African Consulate there.  Paragraph 10 points were 
duly formatted as a non-paper and faxed.  On November 4, 
poloff received an email from a Consulate employee saying the 
points had been shared with the SAG mission to the U.N. 
 
¶2.  In the absence of a reply, post advises that based on 
past impressions and conversations we anticipate South Africa 
will likely support the resolution to be presented in the 
November 4 debate, in any form endorsing the Goldstone 
Report.  Post feels there is little likelihood of our 
changing the South African position.
