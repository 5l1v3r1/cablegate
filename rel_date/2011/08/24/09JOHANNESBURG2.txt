¶1.  (U)  Summary - On January 2, 2009, the Palestine Solidarity 
Committee (PSC) of South Africa mobilized approximately 1000 
demonstrators outside the U.S. Consulate in Johannesburg.  The 
purpose of the rally was to protest against Israeli military 
operations currently underway in Gaza and U.S. support for 
Israel.  The crowd was generally aggressive and confrontational. 
 Nevertheless, the event concluded without incident; no arrests 
were made and one injury was reported.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  On January 2, 2009, from 1400 to 1630, the Palestine 
Solidarity Committee (PSC) of South Africa mobilized 
approximately 1000 demonstrators outside the U.S. Consulate in 
Johannesburg.  The purpose of the rally was to protest against 
Israeli military operations currently underway in Gaza and U.S. 
support for Israel.  As required by law, the PSC applied for and 
was granted a permit to protest by the City of Johannesburg. 
Although the permit estimated 50 participants, the actual number 
at the peak of the demonstration was approximately 1000 as 
estimated by RSO staff. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Local police and LGF personnel provided perimeter 
security but were significantly outnumbered and threatened by 
protestors.  Despite numerous attempts to force the crowd into a 
pre-designated area across the street, the crowd soon pushed 
their way into the street and up to the vehicle bollards.  While 
generally avoiding physical confrontation, the demonstrators 
were aggressive and confrontational, chanting 
anti-American/anti-Israeli/pro-Palestinian slogans and carrying 
banners of a similar nature.  In addition to the many 
Palestinian flags and banners with such slogans as "Free 
Palestine," "No Justice, No Peace" and "This Is a Holocaust" 
were more extreme messages, for example, a banner reading "One 
Bullet, One Zionist, Obama X, Osama [check]" with one 
demonstrator actually wearing a rubber Osama bin Laden mask over 
his head.  Police officials, surprised by the size of the crowd, 
called for additional units.  Despite an RSO request to disperse 
the crowd based on failure to comply with conditions, police 
refused to do so citing the fear of further provocation.  The 
permit granted clearly stipulated all entrances/exits would not 
be blocked.  With the street filled with protestors, police shut 
down the road and allowed the demonstration to continue as 
scheduled.  Several crowd members held up shoes in a sign of 
protest and a number of shoes and plastic water bottles were 
hurled over the perimeter wall.  Several local and international 
journalists were on hand to record the activity.  At 
approximately 1630, event organizers concluded the rally and 
dispersed the crowd.  No arrests were made.  A photographer for 
the Financial Mail claimed a demonstrator tried to punch him and 
hit his camera. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Post disseminated both a security bulletin and warden 
message on December 31, 2008, reminding people to avoid such 
gatherings.  Consulate employees remained inside the building 
until the conclusion of the event.  RSO will convene an 
after-action meeting with local police in an effort to improve 
upon existing crowd control measures.
