REF: STATE 11130 
 
¶1. (U) Information requested reftel follows. 
 
Status of Rewards for Justice Program 
------------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Rewards for three informants involved in the May 
2004 arrest of indictee Yusuf John Munyakazi are still 
pending Department action.  (Comment:  In 2004 local press 
wrote about delays in payout of Rewards-for-Justice rewards 
to informants.  Those particular issues were resolved, but 
the publicity was unhelpful and post wishes to avoid a 
repeat.  End Comment.) 
 
DRC Needs ICTR Resources, Attention 
----------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) Jallou has declared several times that most indicted 
Rwandan genocidaires who are still free are in the DRC.  Over 
the past two years, five indictees have been arrested in the 
DRC and Congo-B and tipsters continue to report many 
sightings, including of some of those cited in para 5 of 
reftel.  However, post has virtually no recent information on 
any of them.  The ICTR has committed few investigative 
resources to tracking individuals in the two countries, and 
has broken up experienced tracking teams and reassigned their 
personnel.  Jallou has yet to make an official visit to 
either the DRC or Congo-B to develop a working relationship. 
Also, the ICTR has not developed any operational protocols 
with MONUC, although MONUC has assisted with arrests and 
transport of indictees at post's request. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT:  In our assessment, if the level of 
professional, skilled attention in the area is not elevated, 
the ICTR will make little or no progress toward arresting 
those indictees still at large.  END COMMENT.
