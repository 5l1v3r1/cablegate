SUBJECT: TUNIS RESPONSE ON MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH 
AUTHORIZATIONS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 94522 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Tunis confirms that Andrea Donnally will be 
responsible for coordinating requests to the GOT for all 
marine scientific research authorizations.  Her tour began 
July 2008 and is scheduled to end July 2010.  Beth Mitchell, 
Commercial/Economic Officer is her back up. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy Tunis recommends requests for research 
authorization be made as early as possible.  The decision 
making process in Tunisia is highly centralized, which often 
leads to delays in receiving a response. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Tunisia's navy stringently monitors the coastline in 
order to protect offshore oil investments and deter illegal 
immigration.  For that reason it is recommended that all 
requests be submitted as soon as possible in order to prevent 
any delays and their associated costs.
