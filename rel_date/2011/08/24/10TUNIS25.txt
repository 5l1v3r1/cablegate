¶1. (SBU) During a January 14 meeting, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Americas Desk Officers Mourad Belhassan and Hatem 
Landoulsi advised pol-econoffs that the GOT was deeply 
concerned for the welfare of Hedi Annabi, the distinguished 
Tunisian Diplomat serving as the Special Representative of 
the Secretary General at the UN Assistance Mission in Haiti 
reported missing (reftel), and feared the worst. (Note: The 
Embassy's UN Contacts in Tunis tell us they also have no 
confirmation about Annabi at this time.  End note.) 
Belhassan and Landoulsi said they would welcome any further 
information the USG might be able to provide on Annabi and 
were unaware of any other official Tunisians in Haiti. 
 
¶2. (SBU) President Ben Ali issued a statement on January 13 
expressing Tunisia's condolences and sympathy to the 
Government and people of Haiti.  (Comment:  Given Tunisia's 
modest resources and considerable distance from Haiti, we do 
not expect the GOT to offer any substantive assistance.  End 
comment.)
