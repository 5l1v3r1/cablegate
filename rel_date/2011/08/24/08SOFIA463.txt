SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: REMEDIATION ASSISTANCE REQUEST FOR 
AMMO STORAGE EXPLOSIONS 
 
REF: SOFIA 451 
 
¶1.  (U)  Summary:  The Government of Bulgaria, through its 
Chief of Defense Zlatan Stoykov, sent a formal request for 
U.S. equipment to assist in remediation of accidentally 
exploded ordinance at the Chelopechene Ammunition Storage 
Facility in Sofia.  On 3 July, a series of powerful 
explosions rocked the city and forced the evacuation of 
residents within a 6 km radius.  Many tons of ammunitions and 
explosives were destroyed and many more are presumed to be 
damaged.  The Government of Bulgaria has not issued a clear 
statement on the cause of the incident, the inventory 
destroyed, or the extent of the damages.  Post offered 
assistance to the Bulgarians immediately after the incident, 
but only on 9 July received an official request for 
assistance.  Post understands that U.S. European Command 
(EUCOM) possesses some or all of the assets the GOB is 
requesting and is standing by to offer assistance, pending 
State Department approval.  Post strongly supports provision 
of assistance and requests expeditious Departmental approval. 
 Post also requests approval to offer approximately $230,000 
(the unspent portion of Bulgaria's allotted Small Arms/Light 
Weapons destruction budget) for remediation of the explosion 
site and destruction of damaged or potentially unstable 
munitions.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  On 9 July, the Defense Attache's Office received an 
official request from the Chief of Defense, the verbatim text 
of which is included below: 
 
"A major incident happened in the area of the ammunitions 
utilization base in the region of Chelopechene near Sofia on 
3 July 2008 at 06:30.  As a result of that the classic 
artillery projectiles storages and big amount of explosive 
blew up. 
 
To liquidate the consequences from this incident, I would 
like to turn to you with a request for free of charge 
assistance to the Bulgarian Armed Forces consisting in 
providing us the following special machinery and equipment: 
 
¶1.    A large robot for EOD activities; 
¶2.    A small robot for EOD activities; 
¶3.    A thermo vision camera; 
¶4.    a container for transportation of undetonated 
ammunitions with trotyl (trinitrotoluene) equivalent up to 
10kg; 
¶5.    Heavy protective clothing for EOD operator (5 sets) 
 
This special machinery and equipment will contribute to the 
successful liquidation of the consequences from the incident 
and will guarantee safe work for the EOD operators. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
General Zlatan STOYKOV" 
 
¶3.  (U)  EUCOM has indicated that it could provide the assets 
requested, though it prefers to send an initial survey team 
to evaluate the site before any equipment is delivered. 
Pending formal Bulgarian approval, this survey team could 
arrive as soon as 11 July.  The Bulgarians have already used 
U.S. equipment donated under the auspices of DTRA's WMD 
counter-proliferation training to verify that there is no 
biological, chemical or nuclear contamination to the site. 
 
¶4.  (U)  On 30 June, the United States and Bulgaria reached 
an agreement on the destruction of small arms and light 
weapons.  After Bulgaria decided not to destroy tens of 
thousands of machine guns originally tapped for destruction, 
only slightly less than $70,000 worth of weapons were 
included in the implementing document  (out of an original 
allocation of $300,000).  Post requests permission to offer 
some or all of the remaining $230,000 to the Government of 
Bulgaria to destroy weapons, ammunition or explosives damaged 
in the blasts and to destroy other excess weapons, ammunition 
or equipment from the site determined to be dangerous, 
unstable or unable to be adequately stored due to damage to 
the ammo storage facility. 
 
¶5.  (U)  Comment:  A week after the incident, accusations, 
rumors and conspiracy theories regarding the cause of the 
explosions at Chelopechene continue to swirl.  Amidst the 
controversy, the government has regrettably put more effort 
 
SOFIA 00000463  002 OF 002 
 
 
in the blame game (with various forces seeking control over 
the investigation process) than on remediation of the site 
and prevention of future accidents.  The government has been 
criticized by the media and the public for its slow response, 
but now that it is asking for our assistance, we strongly 
believe it is in our interest to aid in any way possible. 
U.S. assistance on this high-profile issue would be welcomed 
by the Government of Bulgaria and very popular with the 
Bulgarian public.  The Department's prompt reply concerning 
permission to provide EUCOM assistance as well as to offer 
additional SA/LW destruction funds would be greatly 
appreciated.  Email instructions should be sent to Joshua 
Huck, Kelly Adams-Smith, Col. David Wilmot and LTC Robert 
Mathers.  End Comment.
