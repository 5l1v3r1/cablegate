¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Chadian rebels have taken up arms again, 
almost one year to the day that they seized and held Chad's 
eastern town of Abeche for 24 hours.  Rebel groups UFDD and 
RFC claim that the Libyan-brokered peace agreement is not 
being honored; the Government of Chad points the finger at 
Sudan's meddling.  Casualties from the clashes are high and 
the President is reported to be at the front directing the 
battle.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Rebel groups led by former Defense Minister Mahamat 
Nouri and Timan Erdimi have taken up arms again.  The last 
week has seen three clashes between the rebel groups UFDD and 
RFC and the Chadian army (french acronym ANT). From November 
24-25 an attack took place in Hadjer Hadid, about 75 
kilometers from Abeche and in the vicinity of a cluster of 
Darfur refugee camps.  On November 27-28 the conflict moved 
north near Am Zoer. As of November 29, a clash is taking 
place 70 kilometers from the town of Guereda. President Deby 
is believed to be at the front directing the battle. One of 
his nephews was killed in the first battle, which produced 
large casualties on both sides.  Eyewitnesses reported that 
over 200 Chadian casualties were taken to hospitals in Abeche 
and N'Djamena.  Battlefield deaths are harder to ascertain 
given the Muslim custom of burying the dead within 24 hours. 
Reporters invited by the Government to view the battlefield 
on November 26 saw evidence of heavy fighting and many 
destroyed vehicles. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 25, the Government Spokesman, Moussa 
Doumgour, blamed the rebel groups for having unilaterally 
broken the peace agreement signed October 25 in Libya 
(reftel).  The Government of Chad (GOC) also blamed Sudan 
(which according to the terms of the agreement was to have 
maintained the rebels on its territory until their 
disarmament) for having allowed the rebels to renew the 
hostilities.  On November 28 Foreign Minister Allam-mi 
announced that they had evidence that Sudan was responsible 
for arming and equipping the rebels. For their part, the 
rebels have stated that the peace agreement was not being 
honored.  They have also warned that any European force 
deployed on Chadian territory must remain strictly neutral or 
else it will be viewed as a "foreign occupying" force. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The UN has restricted non-essential travel but has 
not evacuated any staff out of Abeche or the region. 
Humanitarian flights are continuing, but road travel between 
Abeche and Farchana has been restricted.  Staff in Farchana 
are currently under lock-down until it is clear that the area 
is safe.  Post canceled CODEL Meek's planned November 28 
visit to Gaga camp (situated between Abeche and Farchana). 
 
COMMENT: 
 
¶4. (SBU)  It is hard to assess how much impact the clashes 
will have on the stability of the regime.  There is 
speculation that President Deby is at the front to ensure 
that this is indeed the rebel's last stand and to oversee the 
pulverization of the rebel forces.  He stated at the signing 
of the Sirte agreement that he would go to war with an 
country backing rebels against his regime. Hot pursuit into 
Sudan is certainly likely; further steps remain to be seen.
