¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Moscow State University, 
Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics Faculty, Moscow, Russia. 
The university is listed on BIS license applications: D384612 as the 
ultimate consignee of one (1) IBM Blue Gene/P high performance 
computer containing two (2) racks. ECCN: 4A003. The licensee is IBM, 
1301 K Street NW, Suite 1100, West Tower, Washington, DC 20005. 
 
¶3. On March 18, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of Moscow State University, 
Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics Faculty, Leninskie Gory, 
MGU, Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Evgeny 
Moiseev, Dean, Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics, 
Anatoly Gulyaev, Deputy Dean, Alexander Lukshin, Vice Dean for 
International Relations and Penko Dinev, Manager of US Export 
Regulations, IBM Central and Eastern Europe. 
 
¶4. The Moscow State University, Faculty of Computational Mathematics 
and Cybernetics was founded in 1970 by the Russian mathematician 
A.N. Tikhonov.  The Faculty of Computational Mathematics and 
Cybernetics is a leading research and training center in Russia for 
all fields of computing and software development.  The Faculty of 
Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics has over 2000 
undergraduate students, of which 200 are foreign students from 
countries not/not subject to restricted use of the reftel 
commodity. 
 
¶5. The IBM Blue Gene/P high performance computer is the only one of 
its kind in Russia.  The IMB Blue Gene/P is the 4th most powerful 
computing system in Russia and the 128th most powerful in the 
world. 
 
¶6. The IBM Blue Gene/P high performance computer is secured inside a 
vaulted card-key access room accessible to only three faculty 
members.  A special Faculty of Computational Mathematics and 
Cybernetics committee decides what projects the IBM Blue Gene/P will 
be used for.  Access to the Blue Gene/P is via a special login 
assigned by the committee.  Each time the system is accessed a 
permanent record of the login is made.  No foreign students are 
issued a login. 
 
¶7. The export control team determined that the IBM Blue Gene/P is 
located at the consigneeQs facility.  The entire shipment is 
accounted for.  The system is being used for the end use for which 
it was licensed. There are no indications of impropriety and 
consigneeQs answers were not evasive. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends Moscow State University, 
Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics Faculty, Moscow, Russia, 
as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
