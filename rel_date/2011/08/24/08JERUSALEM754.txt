Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Positive coverage of the meeting between Palestinian President Abbas 
and Israeli Premier Olmert appears on all front pages.  According to 
the lead stories, discussions between the two leaders were, "deep 
and serious." However, reports also highlight the "gap" that remains 
between the two sides' positions on many issues.  Al-Quds quotes 
Abbas spokesperson Abu Rudaynah stating that, "positions are still 
very far apart on the borders issue."  Al-Ayyam runs a second Abu 
Rudaynah quote, "Abbas will have to make dramatic decisions if an 
agreement is not reached." Meanwhile, Nimr Hamad, political advisor 
to Abbas, tells Al-Quds, "the American Administration is working on 
getting agreement for a framework on the definition [of borders] of 
a future Palestinian state."  Hamad also refutes press reports that 
Abbas is frustrated with the current status of negotiations. 
 
The dailies report that Secretary Rice has asked Israel to reach an 
agreement with the Palestinians on, "borders for a Palestinian 
state," during the upcoming visit by President Bush.  Al-Ayyam 
highlights that Rice confirmed that, "the two sides are making 
progress."  On the ground, the dailies focus on news that American 
"supervisors" will be, "monitoring the removal of checkpoints," in 
the West Bank. 
 
Palestinian Authority (PA) security efforts in Jenin win positive 
coverage in the dailies.  The papers report that the security 
campaign will begin by focusing on villages surrounding Jenin. 
Al-Quds reports that Jenin Mufti, Muhammed Salah, praised the PA 
security efforts and called upon the people of Jenin to obey 
security rules and the law and to help the PA achieve its security 
mission in the city.  Ministry of Information Al-Malki adds his 
support to the mission, stating that the PA government is determined 
to make the Jenin security campaign a success, papers note. 
 
According to front page reports, Palestinian Authority employees 
will receive their salaries and another 1000 Shekels (200 USD) on 
May 6.  Palestinian Information Minister Al-Malki revealed to press 
that, "the Government has earmarked money to implement projects in 
the cities of Jenin and Hebron."  The projects will include 
industrial and infrastructure projects, reporting adds. 
 
Regarding the issue of Nablus wheat flour being fit for human 
consumption, Al Ayaam's front page runs comments by the Minister of 
Information Al-Malki stating that the flour in Nablus, "is not 
suitable for human consumption."  He adds that, "we are waiting to 
send the flour out of the country."  The article continues weekend 
reporting from the Maan news website that, "hundreds of 
Palestinians... attacked World Food Program (WFP) warehouses on 
Sunday, demanding that they have access to donated flour that the 
Palestinian Health Ministry says is unfit for human consumption." 
Neither article mentions the U.S. government as the source of the 
donated flour and coverage continues to define the issue as a 
UN-Palestinian Authority affair. 
 
Ongoing Palestinian preparations to commemorate "the catastrophe" 
[nakba] receives extensive coverage in the dailies.  Related 
coverage highlights the Israeli closure of West Bank checkpoints in 
preparation of Israel's 60th anniversary celebrations.  The dailies 
also note that Israeli forces invaded Nablus and Qalqilia on May 5.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs its daily editorial entitled 
"Negotiations... lost time" (5/06):  "After meeting with Abu Mazen 
[Abbas] and heads of the Palestinian and Israeli negotiation teams, 
Secretary Rice extended her visit to the region in order to continue 
talks with the Israeli side.  We have heard news about progress 
being achieved regarding border issues.  An Israeli source has said 
that things are moving forward and Dr. Sa'eb Erakat says that, 
"negotiations were serious."  In any case, the American President 
Bush is coming to the region in a few days to participate in the 
Israeli celebrations of independence.  He will also hold meetings 
with Arab officials and with Abu Mazen regarding the promised 
solution... we are facing a critical time and any observer needs 
enormous optimism to believe that it is possible for real and 
serious movement on the settlement issue and an agreement during the 
remaining months of Bush's term.  It is probably more realistic to 
say that these negotiations are [just lost time] which in the best 
case scenario will only lead to a new declaration of principles that 
will need [never-ending] negotiations to be implemented..." 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam features veteran columnist Hani Al-Masri, 
opining under the title, "What is the reason for Rice's optimism?" 
(5/06):  "Despite all indications that many difficulties still stand 
in the way of an Israeli- Palestinian agreement, Secretary Rice 
still believes in the possibility of reaching an agreement this 
year. So, what is the reason for Rice's optimism?  The answer might 
be found in the comments made by an Israeli official regarding... a 
request by Secretary Rice to publish a document that reveals the 
progress that has been made until now in Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations... This progress ... will show the outlines of a peace 
agreement that will not be implemented right now, but will clarify 
the political horizon for future negotiations... Rice continues to 
spread hope because [she knows that lack of it]... will become a 
roadblock to future negotiation efforts and make the American role 
seem like nothing but a [political] game."
