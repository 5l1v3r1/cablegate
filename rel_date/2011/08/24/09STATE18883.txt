SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN - UNAMA GUIDANCE 
 
REF: USUN 153 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is an action request.  In response to 
reftel, and per interagency decision, the Department 
authorizes USUN to communicate to officials at the UN and 
relevant Permanent Missions in New York that the U.S. 
Government does not support reconfiguration of the current 
UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) mandate. 
Post should also note that the current U.S. interagency 
Afghanistan-Pakistan policy review is ongoing and could 
impact our position. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In addition, USUN should instead seek a 12-month 
renewal of the UNAMA mandate as authorized in UN Security 
Council resolution 1806 (2008), if possible with two 
minimal modifications.  First, we would like the next 
resolution underscore the importance of UNAMA's role in 
promoting good governance and preparing for free and fair 
elections.  Second, the resolution should contain a 
request that future reporting by the Secretary General 
focus on benchmarks of progress in key areas such as 
elections, national and local governance including 
government accountability, human rights, economic 
restructuring and reform, humanitarian situation and 
assistance, regional cooperation, and coordination of 
international assistance.
