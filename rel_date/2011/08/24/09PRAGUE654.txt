AFGHAN GOVERNMENT ON GOVERNOR APPOINTMENTS 
 
REF: STATE 109882 
 
(SBU) Poloffs met with Czech MFA's Afghanistan Desk Officer 
Irena Blehova on November 4, 2009, to convey reftel talking 
points.  Blehova, noting MFA's belief in a need for greater 
concerted action among PRTs on a variety of issues, reported 
that an effort is already underway to formally strengthen 
coordination between the PRTs of EU member states.  She 
concurred with our assessment that effective engagement on 
governor appointments should be a priority objective for such 
improved coordination.
