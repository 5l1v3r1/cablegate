Positive Outcome Expected from Hill-Kim Meeting 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. MFA Spokesperson Qin Gang said at the regular March 1 MFA 
press conference that China expects a positive outcome from 
talks between DPRK VFM Kim Kye-gwan and A/S Hill to be held 
in the next few days in the United States.  The meeting is an 
important step towards implementation of the joint statement. 
 Qin had no information regarding the time and place of the 
nuclear disarmament working group of which a reporter said 
China is in charge. 
 
Deputy Secretary's Meetings in Beijing 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte will meet with 
State Councilor Tang Jiaxuan, FM Li Zhaoxing, VFM Dai Binguo 
and VFM Yang Jiechi during his March 3-5 visit to China, Qin 
said in response to questions. 
 
Iran Nuclear Issue 
------------------ 
 
¶4. Asked what actions China is considering with regard to the 
Iran nuclear issue, Qin said China advocates peaceful 
diplomatic negotiations.  China hopes that Iran will abide by 
UNSCR 1737 and respond positively to concerns of the 
international community.  Other parties should stick to the 
international framework in resolving the issue, Qin said. 
 
Japan Official's Visit to Chinese War Memorial 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5. The fact that a Japanese LDP official this morning visited 
a war memorial in China is a positive sign for Premier Wen 
Jiabao's upcoming visit to Japan, Qin said in response to 
questions.  China and Japan reached a consensus last year on 
how to improve relations and China hopes for continuous joint 
efforts, Qin said.  Qin said the establishment of Japan's 
Council on National Defense Security is Japan's internal 
affair but China hopes Japan will continue on the road of 
peaceful development. 
 
VP Cheney's Remarks on China's Military Spending 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6. In response to questions about Vice President Cheney's 
recent remarks on the lack of transparency in China's 
military spending, Qin compared the remarks to the situation 
of a man who stands at the door of his neighbor's home 
demanding to see inside and see what the man's family is 
doing.  If someone asked to see your underwear, how would you 
feel?, Qin asked.  Qin further gave a lengthy elaboration of 
China's diplomatic policy, emphasizing that China does not 
interfere in the internal affairs of others, does not bully 
others and does not use double standards.  China is focused 
on building a harmonious world of universal prosperity and 
lasting peace, Qin said.

Abuse of Migrant Workers "Undeniable" 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Qin denounced an Amnesty International report on abuse of 
migrant workers in China and called "irresponsible" the 
report's conclusion that China's economic development comes 
at the cost of human rights.  Nonetheless, he acknowledged 
that legal rights of migrant workers have "undeniably" been 
abused in some places in China.  The Communist Party and 
Chinese government attach great importance to proper 
treatment of migrant laborers, the Chinese people fully 
respect the role of migrants in China's industrialization and 
modernization.  China has taken and will continue to take 
measures to address problems faced by migrant workers, he 
said. 
 
China a Victim of Protectionism 
------------------------------- 
 
¶8. Asked to comment on China's reported violation of WTO 
rules, Qin said the Chinese government conducts all matters 
on the basis of the WTO rules.  China advocates using 
friendly negotiation to resolve any disputes and strongly 
opposes protectionism.  China has suffered "the most" from 
anti-dumping investigations.  He declined to specify who made 
China a victim of protectionism.  He deflected a question on 
a trade issue with Mexico and called for all parties to 
follow WTO rules. 
 
NPC to Ratify Treaty on Southeast Asia 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. Qin was asked to clarify the process by which the National 
People's Congress (NPC) ratifies treaties, such as one 
concerning China's border with Southeast Asian nations 
expected to be ratified at next week's NPC meetings.  He said 
treaties must pass through the legislative bodies of most 
nations and China's system is no different.  Responding to a 
follow-up question for a specific list of treaties ratified 
by the NPC, Qin referred the reporter to bookstores. 
 
Nepal to Join SCO? 
------------------ 
 
¶10. Qin said he had not heard reports that Nepal wanted to 
join the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), but said 
the addition of observers and new members should be decided 
through consultation and consensus with current SCO member 
states. 
 
Chinese official to Ghana 
------------------------- 
 
¶11. Abdul'ahat Abdulrixit, Vice Chairman of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, will visit Ghana March 6-7 as the special envoy 
of Chinese President Hu Jintao.  He will attend an event for 
the 50th anniversary of the Republic of Ghana.
