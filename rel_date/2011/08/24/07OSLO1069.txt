 (SBU)  On October 26 we delivered reftel points to MFA Latin 
American Section Director Herberth Linder and Senior 
Adviser/Cuban Desk Officer Oyvind Johanssen.  Although Linder 
stated that USG concerns were "duly noted," the GON will 
continue its long-standing tradition of supporting the 
resolution.
