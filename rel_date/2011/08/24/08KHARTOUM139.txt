¶1. (SBU) The UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) mandates that all civilian 
employees, military personnel, and UN Volunteers undergo training to 
recognize, report and prevent sexual exploitation and abuse. 
According to the UNMIS Chief of Conduct and Discipline Aster Zaoude, 
all personnel must undergo preventative sexual exploitation and 
anti-abuse training at induction and then refresher field training 
while in country.  As an example of the training, Zaoude said that 
the UN, in cooperation with the Office of Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the Government of South Sudan, 
conducted field training and workshops on January 22 to 24, in Juba. 
The field training included a train-the-trainer component, which 
will continue to train smaller field elements aimed at combating 
sexual exploitation and abuse. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Zouade said that the sexual exploitation and abuse 
monitoring task force established in 2007 (ref B) continues to meet 
regularly with the Government of South Sudan (GOSS), local NGOs and 
with the senior UN country elements.  The monitoring task force has 
programs to inform the public of UN efforts to combat sexual 
exploitation and abuse and to educate the public on where to report 
allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse. Zoaude emphasized the 
ongoing and comprehensive nature of the prevention programs. 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNAMID human rights officers told poloff on January 29 that 
UNAMID is still in the process of recruiting staff but plans to have 
its own Conduct and Discipline Unit.  They stated that UNAMID would 
institute and maintain the same preventative measures to combat 
sexual exploitation and abuse as UNMIS. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In January 2007, allegations surfaced that UNMIS personnel 
engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse against the local 
population. Since then, UNMIS conducted an aggressive training 
program (ref B) and instituted a "zero-tolerance" policy against 
such exploitation and abuse.  For the remainder of 2007, post is not 
aware of any sexual exploitation and abuse allegations against any 
UNMIS staff or AMIS staff in Darfur.
