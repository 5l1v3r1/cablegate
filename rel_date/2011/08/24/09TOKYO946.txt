DARFUR, SUDAN 
 
REF: STATE 39748 
 
Â¶1. (U) Japan is keen to provide support for the Ethiopian 
deployment as part of the United Nations-African Union 
Mission in Darfur (UNAMID).  However, it has not identified a 
line item in its current budget to use for drawing the needed 
funds, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, First Africa Division 
Assistant Director and Sudan Unit Head Toru Sugio told emboff 
April 22.  Sugio said restrictions governing Japan's ability 
to provide direct country funding, rather than through a U.N. 
agency, and limits on the types of equipment Japan can 
finance complicate efforts to identify funds.  Sugio 
stressed, however, that Japan will consider ways it can 
contribute.
