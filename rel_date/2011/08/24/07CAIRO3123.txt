SUBJECT: MUBARAK CLAIMS PROGRESS ON REFORM, CALLS FOR 
"RESPONSIBLE FREEDOM" 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  In an address marking the fifth 
anniversary of the opening of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, 
President Mubarak said Egypt has "gone a long way" on the 
road to reform.  Compared to the 1970's, he said, Egyptians 
enjoy far greater freedoms now.  However, he stressed, 
freedom is "both a responsibility and a commitment," and 
cannot be used as a cover to slander or encroach on the 
freedoms of others.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a speech marking the fifth anniversary of the 
opening of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina on October 23, 
President Mubarak focused on Egypt's political and economic 
reform program, noting that Egypt has made great strides, but 
that the road to reform would not be "full of roses."  He 
said he was particularly concerned for Egypt's poorest, and 
was doing his utmost to protect them from adverse effects of 
a rapidly developing economy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Compared to the 1970's, Mubarak continued, 
"Egyptians enjoy unprecedented freedoms."  Furthermore, he 
said, none of these advances could have been made without an 
environment of peace, security, and stability.  Egyptians 
must realize, he stressed, that freedom is "both a 
responsibility and a commitment," and that "our freedom ends 
when it encroaches on the freedoms of others.  Freedom of 
expression, opinion, and press does not mean we are free to 
slander others." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Turning to Egypt's regional role, Mubarak said that 
there is a close link between Egypt's national security and 
that of the region as a whole.  "Egypt's peace and stability 
hinges on the peace and stability of the entire Middle East." 
 He added that Egypt is working towards the establishment of 
a "just regional peace" that would include an independent 
Palestinian state. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  According to emboff who was in the 
audience, Mubarak's tone was defensive, especially when 
comparing Egypt's freedoms of today with those of thirty 
years ago:  "Where were the freedoms of expression and the 
press then?  Where were the economic advances we enjoy today 
then?"  He appeared to be addressing his critics at least as 
much as promoting positive achievements.  Among those critics 
is the editor of Al-Dustour newspaper, Ibrahim Eissa, whose 
trial resumed today in Cairo on charges of spreading rumors 
about Mubarak's health.  Mubarak's reference to Egypt's poor 
is also noteworthy in light of a recent UN report that showed 
a rise in the absolute poverty rate from 16.7 percent of the 
population, to 19.6 percent, from 2000 to 2005.  As UN 
resident coordinator James Rawley put it, "One in every five 
Egyptians cannot meet their basic living needs."
