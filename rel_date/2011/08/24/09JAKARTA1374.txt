SUBJECT: U.S. GLOBAL PEACE OPERATIONS INITIATIVE (GPOI) 
FUNDING PROPOSAL 
 
¶1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  USPACOM put forward its draft FY 2010 GPOI 
Program Proposal, which requests funding to support 
Indonesian Peacekeeping Training in three areas: training, 
facilities, and equipment.  According to USPACOM 
representatives, Indonesia will be a top priority for GPOI 
funding within PACOM's Area of Responsibility (AOR).  This 
program would also fit in well with the political and 
security initiatives we are pursuing with the government of 
Indonesia in advance of a potential visit by President Obama 
in November.  END SUMMARY. 
 
PEACE SUPPORT OPERATIONS TRAINING 
 
¶2.  (U)  The GPOI proposal notes that the primary goal of the 
program training is to produce competent and professional 
peacekeepers (from Indonesia and third countries) according 
to United Nations (UN) guidelines, using hands-on and/or 
performance oriented methods in the classroom, in the field, 
and in exercises.  PACOM estimates the program cost will be 
around $620,000 and anticipates the end results will be: 
 
-- Advancement of security cooperation between Indonesia and 
the U.S.; 
-- Strengthening of military-to-military relationships; 
-- Standardization and enhanced inter-operability within UN 
guidelines and across the Asia Pacific Region; 
-- Encouragement of long-term sustainability of Peace Support 
Operations (PSO) individuals and units through a "Train the 
Trainer" focus; 
-- UN training recognition of PSO individuals/units. 
 
PEACE SUPPORT OPERATIONS FACILITIES REFURBISHMENT 
 
¶3.  (U)  The GPOI program proposal also requests funding for 
improvement of existing facilities and training areas.  It's 
noted that to the greatest extent possible, renovations and 
improvements to existing facilities will be made, however, 
some new construction may be necessary to ensure provision of 
adequate training facilities.  Training facilities would 
include equipped classroom space; field training areas; 
office space equipped with furniture and internet 
connectivity; training accommodation, including sanitation 
and dining facilities; and vehicle support.  PACOM estimates 
the cost for this portion of the program would be around $1.5 
million. 
 
PEACE SUPPORT OPERATIONS EQUIPMENT 
 
¶4.  (U)  The GPOI program proposal also requests funding for 
training aids, materials, and non-lethal equipment required 
for conducting training, and also funding for equipment that 
would assist development and sustainability of PSOs and 
support regional requirements.  PACOM estimates the cost of 
the equipment would be around $1.55 million.
