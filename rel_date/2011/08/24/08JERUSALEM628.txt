     ¶B. JERUSALEM 588 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  The PA Employees Union and the Palestinian 
Teachers Union continued their strike on April 10 in defiance 
of a Palestinian High Court order.  The High Court issued an 
injunction against the strike on April 9 and ordered the 
union to present its case at a follow-up hearing on April 30. 
 Approximately 1500 PA employees demonstrated peacefully in 
front of the Prime Minister's office on April 9.  A number of 
PLC members, including the head of the Fatah parliamentary 
bloc, spoke in support of the employees' demands.  In public 
comments, PM Salam Fayyad praised the role of the judicial 
system as a crucial pillar of good governance.  There were 
continuing mediation efforts ongoing April 10.  End Summary. 
 
Strikes Continue, Despite Court Order 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 9, the Palestinian High Court agreed to 
review the PA petition to block the strike, which the 
government had filed in accordance with President Abbas' 
April 6 decree (reftels).  The court ordered the strike be 
suspended, pending a hearing set for April 30.  It gave the 
unions fifteen days to present their case to the court.  In 
public comments after the court hearing, Fayyad praised the 
role of an independent judiciary in building the foundations 
of good government. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The strikes continued on April 10, with PA schools 
closed and other PA offices open only part of the day.  PA 
Employees Union head Bassam Zakarneh complained that the 
union's lawyer had been ordered out of the High Court hearing 
and said that, because the court had "refused" to hear the 
union's position, the union would "consider next steps" once 
it received the High Court's order in writing. 
 
Unions' Protest Peacefully, Get Politicians' Support 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Approximately 1500 PA employees demonstrated 
peacefully in front of the Prime Minister's office for about 
ninety minutes on April 9.  A number of speakers expressed 
support for the employees and urged the government to meet 
their demands.  Speakers included prominent members of the 
Palestine Legislative Council (PLC), including the head of 
the Fatah bloc Azzam al-Ahmad. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On April 10, Azzam al-Ahmad continued his efforts to 
mediate an end to the dispute (as outlined ref A).  In a 
meeting with President Abbas, Al-Ahmad asked Fayyad to freeze 
the government's actions against the striking workers. 
Fayyad refused.  However, Fayyad's representatives (including 
Cabinet Secretary Sa'adi al-Krunz) continued to meet with 
union leaders throughout the day. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶6. (SBU) The court ruling was a victory for the government, 
but the Fatah-inspired agitation against the government has 
not ended.
