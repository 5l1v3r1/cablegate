¶1. (U) On February 1, the U.S.-funded, human rights-oriented police 
training program resumed, following its suspension in July 2008 
pending bilateral negotiations related to the change in funding 
from ESF to INCLE (reftels).  The February 1-3 three-day course 
focused on "Data-based Decision Making" to train officers to make 
decisions based on relevant information, as opposed to instinct. 
The course also emphasized the importance of engagement with local 
communities to gain their trust, with the goal of better serving 
the public and gathering crime data more effectively.  The next 
training course is planned for March 23-25, and will focus on 
conforming to international policing standards.  Subsequent courses 
are planned for May on interview and interrogation skills, July on 
appropriate use of force, and September on community policing. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) At the start of the course February 1, Interior Ministry 
State Security General Amr Al-Asr addressed the 24 assembled police 
officers, stressing the training's importance and encouraging the 
officers to interact with the program instructors.  General Amr 
thanked the Embassy and the State Department, and underlined to the 
officers the importance of the U.S.-Egyptian strategic 
relationship.  Officers participating in the training course are 
majors and lieutenant colonels, and are from the Interior Ministry 
(MOI) State Security Investigative Service, MOI public security, 
MOI anti-narcotics department, and MOI traffic department.  The 
officers are stationed in Cairo and Alexandria, as well as a range 
of cities in the Delta and Upper Egypt.
