REF: STATE 58770 
 
1.(SBU) A/DCM delivered reftel points and draft TIP report 
narrative to MFA Undersecretary Sheikh Abdulaziz Al Khalifa 
on June 3.  Al Khalifa expressed some disappointment with the 
watchlist designation, but remained hopeful that continued 
progress would see further improvement in the ranking next 
year.  He was very pleased to learn of Marietta Dias' 
selection as a "Hero," saying, "She really deserves it." 
 
Â¶2. (SBU) Al Khalifa said that Bahrain will host the follow-up 
to the Vienna convention on anti-trafficking in the first 
week of November in cooperation with the Suzanne Mubarak 
Women's International Peace Movement, and that he had 
discussed what he saw as Bahrain's shortfalls - the lack of a 
statistical database, popular confusion about the definition 
of trafficking, and the need for judicial training - with 
Fiona El Assuity, of the International Organization for 
Migration.  Al Khalifa also noted that the GOB recently 
formed the inter-ministerial anti-trafficking committee 
required by the new anti-trafficking law, and that four NGOs 
were included on the committee.
