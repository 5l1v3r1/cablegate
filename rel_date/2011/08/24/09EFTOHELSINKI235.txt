 ¶1.  (U)  Embassy Helsinki invited Iranian Ambassador and 
Deputy Chief of Mission to the Independence Day reception, 
which was held on Wednesday, June 17.  (July is the 
traditional holiday month in the Nordic region.)  The 
invitees regretted the invitations, and did not attend. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During a June 5 diplomatic event in Helsinki, the 
American-citizen wife of a third-country diplomat told Charge 
that the Iranian Ambassador had expressed delight at 
receiving the invitation.  Asked by her whether he would be 
attending, the Iranian replied that he expected his Foreign 
Ministry to instruct all Iranian embassies on how to respond. 
Iranian DCM, who attended the June 5 event, made a point of 
telling Charge how happy he was to be invited to the U.S. 
event as well as how significant he had found President 
Obama's Cairo speech.
