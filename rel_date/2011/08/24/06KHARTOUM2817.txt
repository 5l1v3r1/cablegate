--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Negotiations Result in Pull-Back; Situation Still Tense 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶1.  The situation in El Fasher appears calmer as of December 7 
despite sporadic gunfire between 1900 and 0030 hours on the night of 
December 6-7, according to UNDSS officials in El Fasher. 
Negotiations among the Sudanese Government, rebel groups, and 
Janjaweed appear to have resulted in a large-scale pull- back of 
Janjaweed and rebel forces from positions outside El Fasher. 
 
¶2.  According to EU Military Observers, North Darfur Deputy Wali 
Iddris Abdullah Hassan met with police and other security forces on 
December 7 to discuss the recent violence in El Fasher.  Riot police 
are widely deployed around El Fasher town center.  Although more 
people are back on the street, only about 10 percent of shops are 
open in the markets, reflecting fears of repetition of recent 
hostilities.  Another student demonstration against the lack of AMIS 
protection of civilians from the Janjaweed at AMIS HQ did not 
materialize, perhaps due to the intensified police presence, 
suggested SLM representatives.

Janjaweed Pulling Out 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  According to UNDSS in El Fasher, on the morning of December 7, 
up to four 8-ton trucks full of Janjaweed were observed driving past 
SLM compounds.  No clashes occurred despite this provocation, and 
the trucks reportedly headed towards Kutum.  A 40-vehicle convoy has 
been reported to be heading towards Al-Salaam IDP camp and the road 
to Mellit.  Several kilometers from El Fasher a 60-vehicle convoy of 
Janjaweed drove back north towards Kutum.  This may be the same 
convoy that had moved south, closer to El Fasher, on December 6, 
possibly as a show of force.
