AI Public Awareness Efforts Increase 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) KOMNAS announced a "Beat the Bird Flu!" multimedia 
campaign to heighten public awareness of bird flu on 
December 1.  This month-long campaign is a joint initiative 
among Indonesia's 24 Hour news channel Metro TV, the 
Indonesian hotel and restaurant association, private 
businesses, and KOMNAS.  The campaign will kick off with a 
charity concert on December 16, featuring top Indonesian 
performers.  KOMNAS will distribute posters, brochures and 
other educational materials about avian influenza nationally 
throughout the months of December and January as a part of 
the private sector effort.  Special television programming 
will begin on January 1 on Metro TV, and will include 
special series, programs and public service announcements 
devoted entirely to the bird flu problem. "We welcome the 
voluntary cooperation of the media and the private sector," 
said Bayu Krisnamurthi, Executive Secretary of KOMNAS. "The 
seriousness of the health threat posed by avian influenza 
means that everyone needs to get involved in this fight." 
USAID is working with KOMNAS to shape the campaign messages 
to encourage consistency with other communications efforts. 
 
¶3. (U) On December 6, Lativi, one of Indonesia's fastest 
growing television stations, carried another episode of the 
State Department-sponsored TV co-op on avian influenza. The 
piece discussed diagnostic methods in Delaware and quoted 
American researchers. 
 
APHIS Assigns Lead for Embassy Office 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) USDA has announced the assignment of Dr. Max Coats as 
Veterinary Officer/Avian Influenza Coordinator to Embassy 
Jakarta.  Dr. Coats will establish a five-person office, 
including several Indonesian animal health professionals, 
which will provide on the ground expertise regarding animal 
health issues surrounding AI in Indonesia. Dr. Coats will 
arrive in January 2007 for an initial tour of 13 months. 
 
Food and Agricultural Organization Coordination Actions 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶5. (U) FAO Indonesia hosted a consultation forum on December 
4 to intensify coordination on technical aspects of 
combating AI in animals.  The forum included an exchange of 
information on AI projects in the poultry sector, 
information on project implementation and discussion of 
missing or under-resourced elements of the GOI National 
Strategic Work Plan.  Over 20 representatives from the 
international donor community (including USAID and FAS) and 
GOI participated in the meeting. 
 
¶6. (SBU) FAO's team of technical experts followed the forum 
with a two-day internal workshop to assess progress to date, 
strengthen support for the Ministry of Agriculture's AI 
Campaign Management Unit, and to finalize the FAO work plan 
for 2007.  FAO plans to use the meeting to establish 
realistic objectives towards full implementation of the 
MOA's National Strategic Work Plan.
