¶1.  (U) Summary. This cable is the third in a monthly series 
recording significant counternarcotics activity in Afghanistan. 
 
COUNTERNARCOTICS HIGHLIGHTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) DEA/NIU Operation WARTHAWG:  On April 20, DEA, in 
conjunction with Afghan National Interdiction (NIU) and Sensitive 
Investigative Unit (SIU) executed two Afghan search warrants on a 
cache location in Achin District, Nangarhar Province.  The initial 
search did not turn up any illicit drugs, but a tip from a detained 
suspect led agents to a previously unknown location approximately 
700 meters from the initial targets. Agents uncovered a cache of 
3000 kilograms of morphine base buried six feet deep in a wheat 
field. SIU agents also seized 12 kilograms of hashish, 5 kilograms 
of marijuana seeds, 1 kilogram of opium, 1 AK-47 magazine and a 9mm 
pistol in an adjacent compound. No arrests were made as the area was 
abandoned.   DoS INL Air Wing provided air support for the 
eight-hour mission. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Governor Led Eradication (GLE)/Poppy Eradication Force 
(PEF): Total eradication figures as of 25 April stand at 4,474 
hectares, with the majority in Helmand province. The PEF departed 
Helmand on April 11, after a three-month operation, with a final 
total of 2,644 hectares eradicated, doubling last year's total. In 
contrast, GLE nationally is lagging compared to last year. Most 
southern provinces did little to no GLE. Helmand eradicated 1,551 
hectares this year. Kandahar, Uruzgan, and Farah deployed forces 
late so results will be limited. With harvest season starting in the 
south, the emphasis has shifted to the Northern provinces. We expect 
Herat, Badakhshan, Farayab, Kapisa, and Baghlan can all achieve 
poppy free status this year with credible GLE campaigns. (We will 
report on GLE program challenges by septel.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Drug Demand Reduction: Drug use in Afghanistan is getting 
significant press attention. NPR's Morning Edition and MSNBC have 
done reports highlighting the problem and the international press is 
showing increased interest in the issue. Meanwhile, the GIRoA 
announced a plan to move all current inhabitants of the Russian 
Cultural Center, a notorious drug haven, to another location, 
reportedly an abandoned building on the outskirts of Kabul. Details 
are still unclear on what support will be provided at this location. 
Once cleared, the Cultural Center will be handed back to the Russian 
Government for renovation. This plan is due to take place in early 
May. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Counter Narcotics Justice Task Force (CJTF). CJTF is 
moving operations to a better equipped facility sooner than 
anticipated as Minister Atmar ordered the CJTF to vacate its current 
building so he could turn it over to the election police.  Although 
the move will enhance operations in the long term, the two-week move 
is having a significant impact on current investigations. 
 
DRUG ARREST AND SEIZURE STATISTICS 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Kabul provided 
the following information on counternarcotics (CN) arrests and 
seizures for March and April 2009.  The statistics are broken down 
by law enforcement organization.

KABUL 00001096  002 OF 002 
 
 
220.2 kg; Heroin:  797.7 kg; Morphine:  920.9 kg; Hashish:  1,087.7 
kg; Precursor chemicals:  119,197 liters and 650 kg of solids. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Total seizures in 2009:  Arrests: 98; Opium: 9,638.2 kg; 
Heroin:  6,800.7 kg; Morphine: 12,235.9 kg; hashish:  12,883 kg; 
Precursor chemicals (liquid): 120,236 liters; Precursor chemicals 
(solid): 4,415 kg 
 
SIGNIFICANT CASES 
------------------------------- 
 
¶12. (SBU)  On March 22, the SIU arrested two would-be smugglers and 
seized 210 liters of precursor chemicals at Kabul International 
Airport. The arrested individuals cooperated with investigators, 
leading to the arrest of two more suspects. They implicated Gul 
Karim, former security commander of Jalalabad City, as the owner of 
the chemicals. A CJTF unit attempted to initiate surveillance on Gul 
Karim's residence in Nangarhar but he was tipped off and fled the 
area. Authorities are pursuing Gul Karim. Despite this setback, this 
case saw SIU using diverse investigative techniques including 
surveillance, undercover personnel, and telephone intelligence as 
well as employing Afghan female investigators. 
 
¶13. (SBU) Two women were arrested on April 1 in Jalalabad on 
suspicion of wearing suicide vests under their burkas. A search by 
female police officers revealed instead vests containing 14.6 kgs of 
heroin. This could indicate a new smuggling tactic as narcotics 
traffickers have not been known to use female drug couriers.
