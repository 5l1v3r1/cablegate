SUBJECT: Health Cooperation-The Need for a Consistent USG Message 
 
REF:  Jakarta 64 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  This is an action message.  By mid- February, 
the USG will need to make a critical decision about our continued 
health cooperation with Indonesia.  In the lead-up to that decision, 
Mission strongly recommends that all USG agencies engaged in or 
considering health cooperation initiatives with Indonesia articulate 
a consistent message.  This unity of voice will be critical to the 
success of upcoming negotiations on the establishment of a joint 
Indonesian-US Center for Biomedical Research and Public Health 
(IUC).  This message explains the issues at stake in those 
negotiations and provides suggested talking points for USG agencies 
dealing with Indonesia on health matters.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) BACKGROUND:  The USG has proposed sending an interagency 
negotiating team to Indonesia in early February to resolve 
outstanding issues regarding the creation of the IUC.  The 
Indonesian government has extended until March 15 the visas of U.S. 
Navy personnel currently assigned to the Navy Medical Research Unit 
(NAMRU-2) in Jakarta to allow for these negotiations.   Health 
Minister Endang Rahayu Sedyaningsih has welcomed the negotiating 
team (see reftel). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A key issue in the negotiations will be the continued 
involvement of U.S. Navy scientific resources and personnel in the 
IUC--a matter of considerable sensitivity for the GOI.  In a January 
14 meeting, Ambassador Hume pressed Minister Endang to pursue a 
solution that includes keeping the Navy's medical research 
capabilities in Indonesia.  Without the Navy's personnel and 
funding, which make up the bulk of USG support for health research 
here, the IUC has little chance of success.  Given the March 15 visa 
expiration date for NAMRU-2 personnel, we need to reach a decision 
on the Navy's continued presence here by mid-February. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) An important element of our strategy between now and 
mid-February will be a clear message to the GOI that a decision on 
the IUC will have an impact on other health cooperation.  We 
recommend that any USG agency considering new programs with 
Indonesia should alert their counterparts to this reality. 
 
¶6. (SBU) TALKING POINTS:  Mission recommends that USG officials use 
the following talking points when discussing health cooperation with 
Indonesian counterparts: 
 
-- President Obama and President Yudhoyono called for deepening 
U.S.-Indonesia cooperation in combating infectious diseases when 
they met in November on the margins of APEC in Singapore. 
 
-- Health cooperation is an important part of the U.S.-Indonesia 
Comprehensive Partnership and a critical priority for both 
countries. 
 
-- Establishing the IUC is an important building block to broader 
health cooperation and an ideal platform for long-term engagement on 
infectious disease research and applied public health solutions that 
will benefit both countries. 
 
--In addition to the Navy, numerous USG agencies and programs have 
interests in collaborating with Indonesia on infectious disease 
threats including US CDC, NIH, USAID, BEP, Defense Threat Reduction 
Agency and others.  The USG anticipates that successful negotiations 
to establish the IUC will provide a framework for USG engagement on 
health issues and will be highlighted in President Obama's possible 
visit to Indonesia. 
 
-- We have a short time to reach agreement on the IUC. Visas for 
U.S. Navy personnel have been extended until March 15.  Given the 
logistical and personnel matters involved, we need to reach a 
decision by mid-February.

-- The continued participation of U.S. Navy scientific resources and 
personnel will be critical to the IUC's success. 
 
-- If the Navy does not participate in the IUC, the overwhelming 
majority of USG funding and personnel available for the center would 
not be available.  The USG cannot transfer these resources from the 
Navy to another agency. 
 
-- We look forward to upcoming negotiations to find a way forward 
that retains U.S. Navy participation in the IUC. 
 
-- A failure to find a way to move forward with the IUC, including 
U.S. Navy participation, could have an impact on other health 
cooperation with Indonesia. 
 
-- Should that be the outcome, the USG will have to carefully assess 
new proposals for health cooperation on a case by case basis before 
determining whether to move forward. 
 
 
End suggested talking points.
