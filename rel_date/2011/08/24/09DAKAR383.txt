THE LAW 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: On March 14, the broadcasting licenses of three 
local community radio stations located in Dakar's suburbs were 
suspended for two months by the National Council for Broadcasting 
 
Regulation (CNRA) for violating a law that prohibits these types of 
stations from covering political issues.  While technically illegal, 
this type of activity is common.  In this instance, these stations 
were broadcasting favorable coverage of the opposition and it 
appears the law was selectively applied.  After much public outcry 
and agreeing to cease and desist to broadcast politically themed 
programs, the licenses were reinstated on March 19. End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 14, CNRA suspended the broadcasting licenses of 
community radios "Oxy Jeunes" (based in the suburb of Pikine), "Afia 
FM" (based in the suburb of Grand Yoff), and "Djoloff FM" (based in 
the suburb of Linguere).  Community radios in Senegal are non-profit 
entities and therefore do not pay taxes.  For Senegalese, community 
radio stations are often a primary source of news and entertainment 
and any closure of these stations generally generate popular outcry. 
 True to form, residents of Pikine were in the process of organizing 
a march in protest against the closure of Oxy Jeunes when its 
license was reinstated on March 19 after all three stations promised 
to stop airing politically related broadcasts. 
¶3. (SBU) Senegalese law forbids community radio stations from airing 
political programs, debates, or messages, nor can they run any 
advertisements (article 19).  If the stations do not comply with 
these regulations, CNRA can impose sanctions, including withdrawing 
their broadcasting license.  During a recent pre-electoral campaign 
tour throughout the country, CNRA held workshops reminding community 
radio stations of the potential sanctions for breaking the 
aforementioned laws.  In response to these workshops, a number of 
stations did suspended their political reporting.  In contrast, 
Commercial radio stations operate under a different code and have 
been extensively reporting on political issues.  These stations, 
however, tend to practice a good deal of self-censorship. 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: In the lead-up to the March 22 local elections, 
community radio stations throughout the country have been regularly 
violating regulations prohibiting them from covering political 
activity.  What is of great interest and reflective of a growing 
trend to repress adverse media is the blatant manner in which GOS 
targeted stations that were airing reporting favorable to the 
opposition.
