SUBJECT: HANDOVER CEREMONY MARKS WATERSHED IN BASRAH 
CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PROJECT 
 
¶1.  On February 9, Ambassador Crocker and Minister of Health 
(MOH) Salih Madhi signed a Memorandum of Understanding that 
laid out the roles and responsibilities for completion and 
transfer of the Basrah Children's Hospital to the GOI.  The 
transfer will take place in stages over the next several 
months.  Other signatories include the United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP) and Project Hope. The handover 
ceremony garnered positive press coverage as a joint effort 
in the bilateral Health Working Group of the Strategic 
Framework Agreement.  The Iraq Transition Assistance Office 
(ITAO), Gulf Region Division (GRD), UNDP and Project Hope 
have worked closely on the project since 2006 despite 
interruptions from insurgent activity and challenges with 
funding and contractors. 
 
¶2.  The handover ceremony was held at the express request of 
the MOH who was eager to assume its responsibility of the 
hospital. Although the U.S.-funded and managed portion of the 
construction is 99% complete and will be finished by April, 
the UNDP contracts will not be completed for several months 
longer.  We are awaiting confirmation on a clear delivery 
date for Project Hope's largest and most expensive equipment 
donations. The MOH has signed Letters of Commitment to 
provide security, staff and maintenance contracts, but has 
not yet identified funding for all requirements.  Training of 
hospital staff has already begun for some positions and 
hiring continues. ITAO has hired a medical hospital 
integrator to continue to assist the GOI to ensure the 
hospital makes the transition from building to hospital over 
the next year.  GRD has also agreed to continue to provide 
some guidance and quality assessments following completion of 
their construction as UNDP contracts continue. The hospital 
is expected to accommodate staff in the next few months and 
to begin treating patients on a limited basis before the end 
of the year, with full operation being phased in. 
 
¶3.  When completed and fully operational, the 101-bed 
tertiary care center will focus on pediatric oncology in 
addition to providing general services to Basrah's residents. 
 Deputy Prime Minister Rafa'a al Issawi, himself a physician, 
has promised to do what he can to ensure that the hospital 
receives the budget necessary to guarantee successful 
operation and expressed hopes that it would eventually become 
a regional cancer center.
