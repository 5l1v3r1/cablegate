SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION ON IRAQ, MAY 11, 2004 
 
 
Â¶1. Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El 
Heraldo" on 5/11 entitled "Beyond 9/11"  "If the `war on 
terrorism' carried out by Bush and his oil-thirsty `falcons' 
has been really caused by the devastating attacks on 
September 11, 2001, there's no doubt that the damage caused 
to the U.S. by Osama bin Laden has exceeded what Bush's 
right-wing extremism had ever expected." 
 
"More than the loss of civil liberties and even the 
xenophobia of the antiterrorist policy within the U.S., now 
the dramatic images of the Iraqi prisoners have been much 
more effective than all Al Qaeda bombs, which have 
demolished the faade of the U.S. as the prototype of 
democracy, the respect of human rights, and liberty." 
 
"Osama bin Laden must be laughing in his hiding place, just 
like all anti-U.S. extremists.  No terrorist attack could 
cause greater harm than those terrible images that are being 
seen around the world." 
 
"Iraq is proving itself to be George W. Bush's political 
epitaph, and he's also breeding his own Vietnam."
