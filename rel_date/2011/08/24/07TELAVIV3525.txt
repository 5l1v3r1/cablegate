SUBJECT: KETZIOT PRISON BECOMES HOME TO AFRICAN 
ASYLUM-SEEKERS 
 
¶1. Summary.  Ketziot Prison, in the Negev desert near the 
Israel-Egypt border, is now home to roughly 1,080 African 
asylum-seekers.  Warden Brigadier General Shlomo Cohen told 
RefCoord and EmbOffs during a December 5 visit that as many 
as 250 asylum-seekers enter Israel each week, but that 
Ketziot is now filled to capacity.  New arrivals come with 
few possessions and are often in need of medical attention, 
he said.  The Prison Authority provides them with temporary 
shelter, food, medical care, and recreational opportunities. 
UNHCR reported December 12 that it receives 30 - 40 new 
African asylum-seekers every day at their offices, but lacks 
the capacity to conduct refugee status determinations for the 
majority of the current caseload.  End Summary. 
 
No Vacancies at Ketziot 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. On December 5, RefCoord and EmbOffs visited Ketziot 
Prison, located just 5 kilometers from the Israel-Egypt 
border crossing at Nitzana, to observe the living conditions 
of 1,080 African asylum-seekers.  According to General Cohen, 
the prison is also home to Israel's largest concentration of 
Palestinian security prisoners and is constantly under threat 
of attack by terrorists seeking to free inmates.  Cohen 
reported that Ketziot began accepting African asylum-seekers 
in May/June, at which time a separate bloc inside the prison 
compound was constructed.  With the bloc now filled to 
capacity and more asylum-seekers arriving in Israel at a rate 
of 250 per week, Cohen said he has given orders not to accept 
more.  However, he later admitted that he may soon build 
another section inside the prison compound in order to 
accommodate new arrivals.  Cohen noted that UNHCR typically 
visits the prison once per week to register new arrivals.  He 
indicated that, in the past three months, the prison has 
released 400 Africans after UNHCR identified them as 
Darfurians. 
 
Africans Arrive In Poor Condition 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. According to Cohen, the African asylum-seekers pay between 
USD 500 - 700 to be smuggled into Israel from Egypt.  When an 
IDF border patrol encounters the Africans, he said, they are 
taken to the nearest IDF facility.  An IDF general officer 
must sign a warrant to assign them to Ketziot.  Most of the 
asylum-seekers arrive only with "the clothes on their back," 
he added.  The Interior Ministry has provided the Prison 
Authority with a "blank check" to provide clothing, food, 
toys, and medical care to this population.  Many arrive with 
illnesses and are taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. 
The warden noted that, while at least four guards must 
accompany security prisoners for hospital visits, the African 
asylum-seekers go only with a driver and, if hospitalized 
overnight, stay by themselves. 
 
Facilities Are Adequate 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. While touring the facility, RefCoord observed that the 
African asylum-seekers are kept in a separate section apart 
from the security prisoners that is enclosed by a fence. 
Inside the fence are six sections, each enclosed by a 
concrete wall.  Four sections house male Africans and two 
sections house women and children.  Each male section 
contains 12 large tents, with 20 cots to a tent, allowing for 
up to 240 men per section.  Bathrooms, showers, and a 
dining/recreational tent with a TV, ping pong table, and a 
game of dominoes were in evidence during the walk-through. 
Two sections designated for women and children are much less 
crowded, with only 94 women and 55 children (including 18 
infants) and each contains a small playground, a dining tent, 
bathrooms and showers. 
 
¶5. Cohen noted that the African residents are allowed two 
family visits per month (vice only one for the security 
prisoners).  Typical family visits are between husbands and 
wives living in different sections.  Cohen indicated that he 
does not face disciplinary problems with this population, and 
contrasted the "hugs and smiles" he receives from the 
Africans with his normal experience as a warden.  RefCoord 
witnessed six African men working on building maintenance. 
Cohen said that the prison pays the Africans a small 
incentive for their work.  The prison provides both adults 
and children with Hebrew language instruction.  Children are 
not yet provided with a formal education, although Cohen 
 
TEL AVIV 00003525  002 OF 002 
 
 
stated his intention to begin transporting roughly 30 
school-age children to nearby schools. 
 
¶6. In brief interactions, one Sudanese man recounted that he 
had left Egypt, where he had lived for 5 years, due to 
insecurity and poor living conditions.  Showing his blue 
UNHCR refugee ID card, he complained that Sudanese in Egypt 
face constant discrimination and harassment by Egyptian 
security forces and that UNHCR had provided them with little 
to no assistance.  In the women's section, one Eritrean 
asylum-seeker described how she had fled her home after her 
husband deserted the army.  She spent only a few months in 
Egypt on the way to Israel and is now separated from her 
husband and child.  The asylum-seekers said they felt safe 
and well cared-for inside Ketziot, but wished to find a 
permanent home and be allowed to work. 
 
UNHCR Requests USG Assistance 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7. UNHCR Honorary Representative Micky Bavli told RefCoord 
December 12 that UNHCR's offices in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem 
continue to receive 30 - 40 new African asylum-seekers every 
day.  Frustrated by the ease with which people can cross 
illegally from Egypt into Israel, he said that the new 
arrivals now crossing the Sinai originate from Libya, 
Lebanon, and other countries in the region.  While some are 
detained at Ketziot, the IDF releases the majority on the 
streets in Be'er Sheva, from where they make their own way to 
Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.  Bavli reported that, of 350 refugee 
status determinations (RSDs) UNHCR conducted recently on 200 
Nigerians and 150 Turks, not one was determined to be a 
bonafide refugee.   He admitted that UNHCR lacked experienced 
RSD staff to interview African asylum-seekers and requested 
USG assistance in this regard. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8. With no end in sight to the growing numbers of African 
asylum-seekers in Israel, the GOI is facing some difficult 
decisions on what to do with those living in Ketziot prison. 
While the facility provides protection and accommodation, it 
is clearly not intended to be permanent.  Israel's fear that 
local integration or third-country resettlement will only 
draw many thousands more to Israel is well-founded, but 
should not get in the way of finding durable solutions for 
those with bonafide refugee claims.  End Comment.
