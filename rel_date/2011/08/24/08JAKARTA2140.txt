SUBJECT:  Q3 GDP GROWTH OF 6.1% EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS, BUT PROSPECTS 
FOR 2009 LOWERED AS VOLATILITY PERSISTS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Indonesia's economy expanded at a higher than 
expected 6.1% (yoy) in the third quarter of 2008, on higher 
government spending, and continued strength in household consumption 
and investment.  While the results boosted hope that 2008 growth may 
exceed 6%, most analysts have reduced 2009 growth forecasts to 
between 3 and 4 percent, well below current government projections. 
Indonesian currency and credit markets remain volatile, with the IDR 
particularly weak, fueling more concerns of further capital 
outflows.  While the GOI advances efforts to secure alternative 
multilateral and bilateral financing to cover the 2009 budget 
deficit through a World Bank-led effort, President Yudhoyono 
continues to reject publicly any consideration of seeking IMF 
support.  Financial market volatility appears to have prompted the 
hurried sale of mid-sized PT Bank Century Tbk, which experienced 
difficulties on November 13, to Bank Sinarmas.  Meanwhile, a public 
presentation by Bakrie Group management on November 17 failed to 
boost confidence in its restructuring plans.  The November 18 
resumption of trading in two remaining Bakrie Group firms (Bakrie & 
Brothers and Energi Mega Persada), suspended since October 7, 
resulted in sharp losses and the triggering of automatic trading 
halts.  End summary. 
 
Q3 GDP Results Stronger Than Expected, 
But Show Early Signs of Global Slowdown 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2. (U) Q3 GDP growth of 6.1% yoy (3.5% qoq), was down from the 
second quarter's 6.4% yoy growth rate, but exceeded expectations of 
5.9%.  2008 economic growth through the third quarter reached 6.3%, 
boosting hopes that the full-year result will exceed 6%. 
Third-quarter growth remained broad-based, prior to the seizing up 
of global credit markets in mid-September.  Household consumption 
remained strong, rising 5.3% yoy (1.9% qoq); the pace of government 
spending accelerated, up 16.9% yoy (7.9% qoq); and investment 
remained in double digits, with growth of 12% yoy (5.4% qoq). 
Exports, which rose by 14.3% yoy, were flat from the previous 
quarter, reflecting plummeting export commodity prices. 
 
¶3. (U) All major production categories contributed to positive 
economic growth on both a yoy and qoq basis.  The transport and 
telecommunications sector rose 17.1% yoy (4.2% qoq); agriculture was 
up 2.4% yoy (6.7% qoq); construction rose by 7.5% yoy (3.1% qoq); 
mining production rose 1.6% (yoy and qoq); manufacturing increased 
4.3% yoy (3.2% qoq); trade, hotel and restaurant sectors rose by 
7.6% yoy (4.6% qoq); electricity, gas and water sector grew by 10.6% 
yoy (2.3% qoq); finance, real estate and company services rose by 
8.5% yoy (1.8% qoq); and services grew by 6.7% yoy (0.9% qoq).  On a 
geographic basis, Java contributed 57.5% to GDP, Sumatera 23.8%, 
Kalimantan 10.1%, Sulawesi 4.1% and remaining areas 4.5%. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Most major analysts have recently reduced Indonesia's 2009 
economic growth projections to 3 to 4%, as evidence mounts that the 
global slowdown and credit crunch are unlikely to turn around soon. 
Government officials are also tempering their growth forecasts, with 
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati stating recently 2009 growth 
may reach only 5% and the chief of the Central Statistics Agency 
advising November 17 that 2009 growth will be below 6%. 
 
Volatility Continues in Financial Markets, 
With Banking Sector Showing Some Nervousness 
- - - - - - - - - - - - --  - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5. (SBU) Indonesian currency, credit and equity markets remain 
volatile.  The IDR traded at more than 12,200/USD on November 18 and 
19, but closed at 11,957/USD (BI mid-rate) on November 19.  Bank 
Indonesia (BI) said strong demand for dollars from firms seeking to 
 
JAKARTA 00002140  002 OF 003 
 
 
cover year-end needs had triggered further rupiah weakness.  BI 
Governor Boediono said November 18 BI would not allow the market to 
drive the rupiah to "irrational" levels.  It is unclear how BI 
intends to accomplish this.  As BI has reduced somewhat its recent 
interventions in the currency markets after seeing a sharp decline 
in reserves, rupiah volatility has increased.   Yields on the 
benchmark ten-year government bond have also risen to nearly 16.76% 
on November 19.  The stock market has also continued to slide, with 
the Jakarta Composite Index down another 6.77% from November 17-19, 
and off its January highs by over 58%. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Tight liquidity and market volatility appear to have 
prompted the hurried conclusion of a letter of intent to purchase 
70% of the shares of PT Bank Century by PT Sinar Mas Multiartha Tbk 
on November 16.  Bank Century had experienced what BI described as 
"technical" difficulties on November 13, when it failed to provide 
IDR 5 billion to BI's clearing system.  While BI issued a statement 
on November 14 stating that Bank Century had provided the needed 
funds and was operating normally on November 14, and that the 
Indonesian banking system remained stable, it appears Bank Century 
was experiencing more than minor difficulties.  BI has denied that 
it played any role in the sale of the bank.  (Note:  The IMF res rep 
told Embassy that the acquisition was not ideal, given that members 
of the Sinar Mas Group's Wijaya family had earlier been banned from 
banking in Indonesia as a result of the misuse of Bank Indonesia 
liquidity credits during the Asian financial crisis.  End note.) 
 
¶7.  (U) Meanwhile, a PT Bahana Securities trader was detained 
November 16 on suspicion of spreading false rumors, reportedly after 
forwarding an e-mail which originated from Singapore which alleged 
runs were occurring on a number of Indonesian banks.  The police are 
reportedly investigating a number of such cases. 
 
 
While Business Community Seeks Full Guarantee 
On Deposits and Other Steps To Help Cushion 
the Real Economy 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
¶8. (SBU) The Yudhoyono administration continues to consider 
additional policy responses aimed at minimizing the impacts of the 
financial crisis on the real economy.  As reports of industry 
layoffs and defaults by wholesale buyers of commodity and 
non-commodity shipments grow, the Indonesian business community has 
pressed the government to take additional steps to support the 
domestic market.  One local business chamber leader told the Embassy 
that President Yudhoyono had pushed BI Governor Boediono to issue a 
"full" guarantee on banking deposits, in order to prevent capital 
flight and improve liquidity.  (Note:  the previous increase in bank 
deposit limits was authorized by presidential regulation and 
effected in a regulation issued by the Indonesia Deposit Insurance 
Corporation.  End note.)  Kadin, the Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, has also continued to press for BI to begin reducing 
interest rates and to guarantee interbank lending. 
 
¶9. (SBU) As additional signs of a slowdown in the domestic economy 
emerge, BI faces growing pressure to ease monetary policy and take 
further steps to improve liquidity.  Its decision to maintain a 9.5% 
policy interest rate on November 6 has been portrayed by some local 
market observers as ultra-conservative, though most international 
analysts continue to focus on tighter monetary policy as BI's main 
tool to prevent a disorderly depreciation of the rupiah. 
Indonesia's recent imposition of regulations on foreign currency 
transactions on November 13 has failed to stem rupiah weakness or 
reduce volatility in local markets.

Efforts to Secure Alternative Financing 
to Cover 2009 Budget Deficit Continue 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶10. (SBU) The government has continued efforts to mobilize 
additional external financing to protect against possible 
continuation of the credit crunch into 2009, deemed by market 
analysts as essential for reassuring currency and credit markets. 
Sources have told Embassy that plans are advancing for a package of 
so-called "stand-by loans" valued at about $5.5 billion over two 
years, led by the World Bank, with bilateral lending support from 
Australia, Japan, France and China.  The structure of the package 
would reportedly be as follows:  Year 1 - World Bank ($1.4 billion), 
bilaterals (total of $1.4 billion); Year 2 - same breakdown.  Other 
sources advise that the package is still a work in progress, with 
final decisions on bilateral participation still pending. 
Diplomatic sources also told Embassy that Japan intends to make an 
announcement at the upcoming East Asia Summmit about an assistance 
package for the region, including for Indonesia.  Meanwhile, 
President Yudhoyono and other officials continue to reject publicly 
any consideration of seeking access to IMF financing, including its 
new Short-term Lending Facility. 
 
Bakrie Group Share Prices Continue to Slide, 
As Public Statement Fails To Reassure Markets 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶11. (SBU) During a public presentation by Bakrie Group management on 
November 17, company officials failed to provide confidence to 
markets regarding its restructuring plan.  Company officials 
admitted that the planned sale of a 35% share of Bumi Resources to 
Northstar Pacific Partners and Texas Pacific Group may face a price 
adjustment as some lenders holding pledged Bumi shares may have 
already sold the shares.  Management also admitted that Bakrie & 
Bros. had defaulted on two repurchase agreements valued at IDR 134.9 
billion (about USD $12 million).  The November 18 resumption of 
trading in two remaining Bakrie Group firms (Bakrie & Brothers and 
Energi Mega Persada), suspended since October 7, resulted in sharp 
losses and the triggering of automatic trading halts.  Bumi shares 
had briefly stabilized on November 14, following a November 13 
announcement of a planned $700 million share buy-back.  They have 
since resumed their slide, losing an additional 26% from November 
17-19, bringing the decline in Bumi's share price to over 78% since 
September 22.
