North Korea Nuclear Declaration and Six-Party Talks 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  At the June 26, 2008 regular MFA press briefing, MFA Spokesman 
Liu Jianchao said that the DPRK has not yet released a declaration 
of its nuclear programs.  Liu told reporters a press briefing would 
be held later in the afternoon with "very important information" 
related to the Six-Party Talks. 
 
China to Deploy More Military Engineers to Darfur 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3.  At the request of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, China will 
continue its participation in the hybrid action in Darfur, Liu 
announced.  The "remaining portion of Chinese military engineers" 
will deploy in mid-July to assist in the construction of roads and 
camps as well as the digging of wells.  China adheres to the 
"two-track" strategy, and remains willing to work with the 
international community to restore peace and stability to the Darfur 
region. 
 
IOC Letter, China Against Politicizing the Olympics 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4.  China is against the politicization of the Olympic Games and 
against the use of the Olympics to interfere in China's internal 
affairs, said Liu when asked about the International Olympic 
Committee's letter warning China to keep the Olympics separate from 
politics.  The letter referred to Tibet CCP Secretary Zhang Qingli's 
comments regarding the Dalai Lama at the June 21 torch relay.  Liu 
said that Zhang's comments were not meant to politicize the 
Olympics, and "one cannot say that China's position is to do so." 
 
Re-opening of Tibet to Foreigners 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Tibet is open to foreign tourists, and journalists interested in 
traveling to Tibet can apply for permission as in the past, the 
spokesman told reporters when asked.  He added that journalists 
traveling to Tibet should "cooperate" and stressed that stability in 
Tibet is in the interest of all Tibet's ethnic groups. 
 
China Against Proliferation 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The United States Government should be clear on China's position 
against proliferation, said Liu when asked about reported criticism 
of China's lack of assistance on nonproliferation issues by a U.S. 
State Department official.  China prohibits any proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and prohibits Chinese companies 
from engaging in such activities, stated Liu. 
 
China to Respect Cultural Differences, Ensure Security 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶7.  China will respect different cultures and religions while also 
ensuring security during the Olympic Games, Liu said when asked 
about reports that China will search Arab Muslims attending Olympic 
events in religious headwear.  China will take the necessary 
measures to ensure security for the Olympics, but understands that

some security measures may cause concerns or inconvenience. 
 
Zimbabwe Should Put the Nation, People First 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  China hopes that the Zimbabwean Government will put the people's 
and nation's interests first, and will continue to seek dialogue and 
a peaceful solution, Liu said when asked what China is doing to help 
solve the political turbulence in Zimbabwe.  Liu described the 
situation as "new developments which have caught the attention of 
the international community." 
 
Secretary Rice Visit, Others 
---------------------------- 
 
¶9.  Liu announced that Secretary Rice will visit China from June 
29-30, but deflected specific questions concerning her schedule, 
including whether or not she will visit Sichuan Province.  Thai 
Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej will visit June 30-July 3, and 
Cyprus Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou will visit June 29-July 1.
