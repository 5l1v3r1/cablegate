REF: SECSTATE 7679 
 
¶1. (U) Poloff discussed reftel points with MFA EU 
Correspondent Alexander Micovcin on January 25. Slovakia's 
delegation will be led by MFA State Secretary Olga 
Algayerova, as Minister Jan Kubis will be hosting a visit by 
the UN Secretary General. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Micovcin predicted that an EU Peacekeeping Mission 
for Chad would be approved and could be deployed before the 
end of the month. Although Slovakia supports this mission 
politically, Micovcin said Slovakia would offer just one 
soldier to the project, a military officer who would serve at 
the Headquarters in France. 
 
¶3. (U) Slovakia understands that Iran remains a threat and 
that any recent progress on thwarting their nuclear ambitions 
is only due to pressure exerted by the international 
community. When Iran is discussed during the working lunch, 
Slovakia will speak in favor of keeping up such pressure. Our 
MFA contacts have confirmed that IAEA DG El Baradei had 
nothing new or positive to report on the Iranian stance when 
he visited Slovakia last week. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Slovakia supports the earliest possible signing of a 
Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with Serbia, 
but understands that consensus likely does not exist for real 
progress to be made at this GAERC. Micovcin said that 
Slovakia does not believe Serbia's EU future should depend on 
the resolution of the Kosovo question. Although ICTY 
conditionality remains important, Slovakia would like the EU 
to have "more flexibility in determining what that means, 
exactly." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Burma will not be on the GAERC agenda and Micovcin 
doubted that it would come up even on the margins - unless a 
state was advocating for its inclusion on the February 
agenda. Micovcin again confirmed Slovakia's willingness to 
support additional sanctions, and said a ban on imports of 
products containing Burmese hardwoods or gems might be 
acceptable.
