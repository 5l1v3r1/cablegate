RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 128442 
 
 On 8/7, Polcouns discussed reftel points with Amb. Mario 
Sandoval, the MFA's Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs. 
 Sandoval, who had already received a copy of the draft UNSC 
resolution on Lebanon from Paraguay's Mission to the UN in 
New York, was skeptical about prospects the resolution would 
be adopted 8/8 given ongoing hostilities and his 
understanding Russia would have objections.  Paraguay 
believes the key is to obtain a cease-fire as a priority 
first and foremost but Sandoval recognized a durable 
resolution of the conflict required a more comprehensive 
approach including addressing Israel's legitimate security 
concerns.
