SUBJECT: Request for Establishment of Defensive Security Coordinator 
(DSC) Position in Caracas 
 
REF: EMAIL RICHARDSON/BASHNAN DTD 12/29/2009; 09 STATE 132334 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Per reftels Caracas requests DS/IP/OPO/FPD 
establish one Defensive Security Coordinator (DSC) position in 
Caracas to manage select Caracas Defensive Planning and Support 
Staff (DPSS).  Post Management and Charge John Caulfield support 
this new position.  Post will provide office space within existing 
RSO Local Investigators Office and all necessary human resources 
(HR) and financial management office (FMO) support to create this 
new position.  Point of contact for this request is Deputy RSO 
Daniel Hernandez, HernandezD@state.gov.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Background Information: AmEmbassy Caracas is a 
medium-size diplomatic mission with a very unique threat 
environment.  Caracas is the only post to hold critical and high 
threat levels in four categories to include crime and political 
violence.  These ongoing threat concerns create added security risk 
management burdens to existing RSO staff.  Currently Caracas RSO 
has three (3) LES positions to supervise the 11 member contract 
Surveillance Detection (SD) team, monitor the 130+ contract local 
guard force and manage the Embassy's residential security program. 
Each of the existing security coordinator positions supervise or 
monitor their respective programs but lack the management 
requirements to integrate all three security programs under one 
umbrella to assist RSO staff in monitoring the overall $5.4 mil LGF 
budget and coordinating the security training and testing of both 
local guards and SD specialists to ensure integration and 
compliance with DS standards. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) With the establishment of a senior LES member, the 
Defensive Security Coordinator would be able to integrate and 
perform program reviews for all three security programs and then 
provide integrated corrective action recommendations to the RSO to 
improve the Mission's overall security posture.  Finally this 
senior LES manager would also maintain RSO security program 
continuity during extended RSO gaps. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U) Point of contact for this request is Deputy RSO Daniel 
Hernandez, HernandezD@State.gov or RSO Wendy Bashnan, 
BashnanWA@State.gov, (58)212-907-8403.
