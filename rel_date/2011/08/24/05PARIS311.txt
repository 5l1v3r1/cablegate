SUBJECT:  DOD DIRECT PARTICIPATION IN EUROSATORY 2006 
 
¶1.  IN ANTICIPATION OF JUNE 2006 EUROSATORY, U.S. EMBASSY 
PARIS STRONGLY SUPPORTS AND ENCOURAGES DIRECT DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE PARTICIPATION IN THIS IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL 
EVENT. 
 
¶2.  THIS LARGEST LAND ARMAMENT TRADE SHOW, SCHEDULED FOR 
12-16 JUNE 2006, PROVIDES AN UNEQUALLED SHOWCASE FOR THE 
BEST IN U.S. TECHNOLOGY.  DOD'S ENTHUSIASTIC AND SUCCESSFUL 
PRESENCE AT THE FOUR PREVIOUS EUROSATORY EXPOSITIONS SERVED 
TO ILLUSTRATE OUR COMMITMENT TO NATO AND COALITIONS AND TO 
DEMONSTRATE OUR CAPACITY FOR TECHNICAL AND MILITARY 
LEADERSHIP WITHIN ALLIANCES/COALITIONS.  OUR BEST SOLDIERS 
STANDING IN FRONT OF OUR BEST EQUIPMENT IS THE MOST 
EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMMUNICATE OUR VOCATION TO LEADERSHIP. 
 
¶3.  THE U.S. EMBASSY IN PARIS STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE 
EQUIPMENT SELECTED FOR THE DOD CORRAL INCLUDE AT A MINIMUM 
THE PATRIOT PAC-3, M1A2 ABRAMS MAIN BATTLE TANK, M2 BRADLEY 
INFANTRY FIGHTING VEHICLE AND THE STRYKER FAMILY OF 
VEHICLES.  GIVEN THE ROLE OF THESE WEAPONS IN THE GLOBAL 
WAR ON TERRORISM, A DISPLAY OF THIS EQUIPMENT WITH DESERT 
CAMOFLAGE PAINT, ACCOMPANIED BY US SOLDIERS IN DESERT BDUS 
WOULD MAXIMIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY.  WE 
WOULD ALSO SUPPORT DISPLAY OF THE MLRS, HMARS AND THE 
HUNTER OR SHADOW UAV.  AS MAIN THEMES FOR THE EVENT EMERGE, 
REQUESTED EQUIPMENT MAY CHANGE AND WILL BE REFLECTED VIA 
SEPCOR. 
 
¶4.  A STRONG DOD PRESENCE IN 2006 WILL ONCE AGAIN ESTABLISH 
THE U.S. AS THE STANDARD AGAINST WHICH ALLIANCE 
INTEROPERABILITY IS MEASURED AND SERVE AS A PLATFORM FOR 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY.  ADDITIONALLY, DOD PRESENCE SERVES AS AN 
INVITATION TO PURSUE TRANSATLANTIC ARMAMENTS COOPERATION 
AND SECURITY ASSISTANCE IN AN ERA WHEN SOME EUROPEANS SEE 
ACQUISITION BASED ON EUROPEAN PREFERENCE AS THE SOLUTION TO 
THEIR DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL REQUIREMENTS. 
 
¶5.  U.S. EMBASSY PARIS CONSIDERS EUROSATORY 2006 AN 
EXEMPLARY OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE VIA A STRATEGIC 
PARTICIPATION PLAN THAT THE UNITED STATES REMAINS COMMITTED 
TO LEADERSHIP IN ACHIEVING GLOBAL SECURITY AND STABILITY. 
RECOMMEND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROVAL FOR FULL, DIRECT 
PARTICIPATION IN EUROSATORY 2006.  LEACH
