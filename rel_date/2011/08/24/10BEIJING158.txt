China's Earthquake Disaster Relief in Haiti 
------------------------------------------- 
¶2. At the January 21 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu stated that China had sent four 
additional peacekeepers to help Haiti's earthquake relief efforts in 
accordance with the "humanitarian and internationalist spirit."  He 
said that China had sent rescue teams to Haiti and provided 
emergency relief supplies and economic assistance in the immediate 
aftermath of the earthquake.  Ma noted that China was ready to join 
the international community in continuing earthquake relief efforts, 
as well as reconstruction. 
¶3. Acknowledging that reconstruction in Haiti would be arduous, Ma 
said the United Nations would need to guide and coordinate relief 
efforts.  China would further consider reconstruction assistance to 
Haiti depending on the changing situation and would "actively 
consider" any United Nations appeal for emergency assistance. 
¶4. Ma noted that Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations Zhang 
Yesui chaired the Review Conference on Haiti at which all parties 
approved UN Security Council Resolution 1908.  This resolution would 
deploy 3,500 peacekeepers to Haiti to help humanitarian and 
reconstruction efforts, and maintain stability, Ma said.  China 
would continue to strengthen coordination with all parties concerned 
to help the Haitian people overcome difficulties and rebuild their 
homes. 
U.S.-Russia START Talks 
----------------------- 
 
¶5. "The United States and Russia, as the two countries with the 
largest nuclear arsenals, would need to substantially reduce their 
nuclear arsenals in a verifiable and irreversible manner to achieve 
comprehensive and necessary conditions for nuclear disarmament," Ma 
stated.  China hoped the United States and Russia would reach a new 
practical agreement as soon as possible through the Strategic Arms 
Reduction Treaty.  Ma explained that China had always advocated the 
complete prohibition and destruction of nuclear weapons.   China was 
therefore willing to work with all parties to continue to promote 
the nuclear disarmament process. 
 
2010 World Economic Forum 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. At the invitation of President of the Confederation of 
Switzerland Doris Leuthard and the World Economic Forum President 
Klaus Schwab, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Keqiang will travel to Davos, 
Switzerland January 25-28 to participate in the 2010 World Economic 
Forum.  Ma stated that the global economic recovery was not yet 
"solid" and the international community should focus on structural 
reforms regarding global economic governance.  The World Economic 
Forum, Ma continued, would be an opportunity for the participating 
parties to discuss and absorb lessons of the financial crisis and 
address international economic cooperation as a means to overcome 
trade and investment protectionism, effective responses to climate 
change, food security, energy security, and other global issues. 
 
Iranian Nuclear Weapons Program 
------------------------------- 
 
¶7. China supported the adoption of a "dual-track strategy" for 
dealing with the Iranian nuclear issue, Ma stated.  Diplomatic 
negotiations were the best method for resolving the nuclear issue. 
China believed that a pragmatic policy to promote dialogue and 
progress in the negotiations was the "right solution." 
 
Zambian Presidential Candidate Remarks 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. In response to reports of calls by a Zambian presidential 
candidate for Chinese-funded enterprises to respect local laws and 
customs and to uphold social responsibility, Ma stated that

Special Representative of President Hu Jintao at meetings on 
Afghanistan and security policy issues to be held in Turkey, Cyprus, 
France, England, and Germany from January 25 to February 6.
