SUBJECT: UPDATE ON YEMENI JEWISH FAMILIES 
 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Post is maintaining close watch on the condition of 
the 45 Yemeni Jews who left their homes in the Saada 
governorate after receiving a threatening letter on January 
¶18.  Press reports on February 4 claiming that the families 
had been returned to their homes were false.  The Jewish 
family's spokesperson was unavailable for comment; however, 
according to post's government and non-governmental contacts, 
including a Jewish community leader from Reyda, the families, 
who were originally housed at a hotel in Saada City by the 
ROYG, have been moved to government-provided housing in Saada 
City. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The ROYG has consistently been caring for the 
group, ensuring their safety and well-being.  It is not 
likely though, considering the escalation of violence in 
Saada between the ROYG and the al-Houthis, that the families 
will be returned to their homes in the near future, as had 
been previously anticipated.  Post will continue to submit 
updates as the situation evolves.
