REF: STATE 182359 
 
¶1.  Summary.  The Indonesian firm PT Trio Yomasu (TY) verified on 
December 11 its order of component parts for aircrafts detailed in 
reftel.  TY supplies the Indonesian Air Force (IAF) with aircraft 
spare parts and maintenance services.  It also serves as a local 
representative for U.S. aircraft parts supplier Electronic 
Manufacturers Associated.  We visited TY's offices on December 15 
and TY management showed us company registration documents and 
supply contracts with the IAF.  An IAF officer confirmed on December 
11 that TY is indeed a registered supplier on the IAF's list. End 
summary. 
 
¶2.  We contacted TY on December 6, to verify order number 05-1008640 
and found that Director Johan Benardi was out of country.  On 
December 11, TY employee Katherine Chandra called the Embassy and 
confirmed that Trio Yomasu placed the order for spare parts listed 
in reftel.  She noted that U.S. aircraft parts supplier Electronic 
Manufacturers Associated (EMS), located at 9707 Mason Avenue, 
Chatsworth, CA, 91311, suggested TY request a "blanket export 
license order" for spare parts for several types of aircraft listed 
in reftel.  The blanket license, according to TY, is for future 
reference.  Once TY receives a procurement contract from IAF for 
aircraft spare parts detailed in reftel, it would use the blanket 
license.  The $2 million license value is an estimated value for the 
company's contract with IAF over a four-year timeframe. 
 
¶3.  In addition to acting as a parts purchaser, TY also performs 
maintenance for the Indonesian Air Force.  The company repairs spare 
parts, avionic systems and other equipment in its workshop located 
at the address in reftel. TY also represents EMS in administrative 
matters including signing contracts with the Indonesian Air Force. 
There is a direct business contract between EMS and the IAF, and TY 
administers the contract on behalf of EMS.  In July 2006, TY 
explored a "Distribution and Warehouse Agreement" with EMS, but 
Chandra said she was not sure of where this agreement stands. 
 
¶4.  We conducted a site visit on December 15 to TY's offices at the 
address listed in reftel.  Chandra showed us a business license 
issue by the Indonesian Ministry of Trade showing that the firm has 
been at the same location since 1996.  Chandra and Benardi said the 
firm subcontracts the majority of its IAF maintenance work to other 
firms.  They showed us a contract with the IAF stating that all 
goods from EMS are to be delivered directly to a secure IAF 
warehouse at an airport facility and kept under guard there. 
 
¶5.  We also contacted Indonesian Air Force Aircraft Transportation 
Division Lieutenant Colonel Amin Sulaksono on December 11 to verify 
the supplier.  Sulaksono confirmed that PY is indeed a registered 
supplier on their list.  He said IAF previously placed an order to 
procure aircraft spare parts through TY.
