SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Chad's official press reported July 27 that Ahmat 
Hassaballah Soubiane, leader of a major Chad rebel group, 
returned to Chad July 26, along with two allied rebel group 
leaders, after having reached agreement with GOC 
representatives, led by National Mediator Abderaman Moussa, 
along the lines of the 2007 Sirte Accord, in Tripoli. 
Soubiane's return to the fold is a major victory for the Deby 
Government and a major success for its patient and serious 
"intra-Chadian diplomacy."  We understand that Soubiane and 
President Deby were meeting today at a local hotel. 
Soubiane's defection to the GOC is politically significant: 
An Arab, he represents an ethnic group that might constitute 
a quarter of the Chadian population and is present in many 
areas of the country.  Reconciliation of one of the most 
credible figures among the leaders of the rebellion weakens 
the remaining warlords as it strengthens the Chadian 
government.  We hope that this defection from the armed 
rebellion will lead to others, reducing the strength of 
Sudan's proxy forces and enabling Chad to reduce its 
attachment to its own JEM proxies.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) Chad's official press reported July 27 that Ahmat 
Hassaballah Soubiane, leader of a major Chad rebel group, 
returned to Chad July 26, along with two allied rebel group 
leaders, after having reached agreement with GOC 
representatives, led by National Mediator Abderaman Moussa, 
along the lines of the 2007 Sirte Accord, in Tripoli.  We 
understand that Soubiane and President Deby were meeting 
today at a local hotel. 
 
¶3.  (U) Soubiane, who was accompanied to Chad from Tripoli by 
CEN-SAD chief Madani Al-Azhari and was greeted at the 
N'Djamena airport by FORMIN Moussa Faki Mahamat and Libyan 
Ambassador Saleh Green, had broken with Deby in 2003 and had 
led since 2006 the Front for the Salvation of the Republic 
Movement (FSR), which conducted armed rebellion against Chad 
from bases in Sudan and with Sudanese government support. 
Soubiane had been a close associate of Chad President Deby 
after supporting the latter's seizure of power in 1990, 
serving as Interior Minister and Ambassador to the United 
States.  Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa was also 
involved in the negotiations in Tripoli. 
 
¶4.  (U) Two other minor rebel leaders, associated with 
Soubiane for the past few months as the National Movement 
coalition, Issa Moussa Tamboule of the UFDR, and Mahamat 
Ahmat Hamit, of the MNR, also signed up to return to Chad 
under Sirte Accord arrangements. 
 
¶5.  (U) Soubiane was quoted as saying:  "It is an ordinary 
accord, a peace accord, that puts an end to hostilities.  I 
returned without preconditions...I am most of all happy to 
return to my country...I will speak of the accord soon 
enough.  But first I owe my respects to the President of the 
Republic." 
 
¶6.  (U)  Abderaman Moussa was quoted as saying:  "The 
President's hand remains open and extended to all exiled 
Chadian political figures."
