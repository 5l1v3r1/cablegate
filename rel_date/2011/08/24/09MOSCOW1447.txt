REFTELS: REQUEST #4210010; DATED 5/11/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Radis Ltd., Zelenograd, 
Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license applications: 
NLR as the ultimate consignee of various I.C. SPDT switches, 
electronic integrated circuits: n/unmounted and various I.C. SP4T 
positive bias switch DC, electronic integrated circuits: n/unmounted 
and other mixed signals. The licensee is Hittite Microwave Corp., 20 
Alpha Road, Chelmsford, MA 01824. 
 
¶3. On May 27, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of Radis Ltd., 12 Radio Street, Moscow, 
Russia.  The export control team met with Yury Golvenko, General 
Director, Alexander Tchoudakov, Commercial Director and Alexander 
Khrustalev, General Director of Elkotech.  The export control team 
was not able to conduct a site visit of RadisQ operations at its 
Zelenograd facilities.  The Zelenograd facility was described as a 
secure building that employs the necessary security components 
required under a compliance program to receive restricted items. 
 
¶4. Radis Ltd was founded in 1992 to develop satellite, radio and 
communications network systems, and also as distributor of 
electronic components.  Radis Ltd has a full production line at its 
Zelenograd facilities where they employ approximately 100 people. 
In 1996 Radis entered into an agreement with Hewlett Packard (HP) to 
be a distributor of HP semi-conductors.  Also in 1996, Radis created 
a subsidiary, Elkotech, to continue the distribution work while 
Radis concentrated on producing its own satellite systems and RF 
amplifiers. 
 
¶5. Radis Ltd has a small laboratory at its Radio Street location 
where the export control team was shown several up converter boxes 
and transformer boxes that contained the Hittite Microwave 
integrated circuits in reftel. 
 
¶6. The export control team found the reftel commodities at the 
consigneeQs Moscow facility; the entire shipment was accounted for; 
the equipment is being used for the end use for which it was 
licensed; there is no indication of impropriety and the consigneeQs 
answers were not evasive. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Radis Ltd., Zelenograd, Moscow 
Region, Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
