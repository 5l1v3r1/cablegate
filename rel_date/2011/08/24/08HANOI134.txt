for the Lebanese government.  Linh said the GVN maintains good 
relations with the Lebanese government and mentioned a recent 
exchange of New Year's greetings between GVN leaders and Prime 
Minister Siniora.  While noting that Vietnam is not in a position to 
provide economic or security assistance to Lebanon, he cited the 
return of Vietnamese laborers to Lebanon as a form of cooperation 
that contributes to Lebanon's development.  Concerning the role of 
Syria, Linh said the GVN opposes any interference by other countries 
in internal Lebanese affairs and that the GVN has advised Syria that 
it must respect Lebanese sovereignty.  He added that although the 
GVN is familiar with reports about links between Syria and 
Hizballah, it has not received concrete evidence about such links.
