(SBU)   Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Cecilia Robles 
Cortes, MFA Director for Human Rights in International 
Organizations on October 25.  Robles told Emboff that Spain 
agrees that the two NAM resolutions on the human rights of 
children in Lebanon are not balanced.  She said that Spain is

withdrawn on technical grounds.  If this proves impossible, 
she said that Spain would enter into negotiations to improve 
the texts.
