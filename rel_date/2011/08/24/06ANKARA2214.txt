The local CTAG meeting under the Russian G8 Presidency held 
in Ankara on 12th April 2006, chaired by Elbrus Kargiyev, DHM 
of the Russian Embassy. 
 
¶1. An introductory note on Russia-G8 CTAG cooperation was 
presented by Petr Stegniy, Russian Ambassador to Turkey.  The 
Ambassador stressed G8's role in the fight against terror, 
with CTAG being an important instrument for that.  The 
purpose of the local CTAG meeting it to contribute to the 
preparations for the 2nd CTAG Conference in Moscow, focusing 
on the ideological aspects of anti-terrorism with reference 
to the UN Resolution 1624/2005.  The importance of NGOs and 
the civil society in general in the fight against terror was 
also stressed. 
 
¶2.  Briefing on the current situation in Turkey and the 
Russian-Turkish counter-terrorist cooperation was then 
presented by Viacheslav Kunakov.  It has been noted that 
terror (including ethnic separatism, religious and leftist 
political extremism) is officially considered a major threat 
to the Republic.  Decades of Turkey's fight against terror 
have provided it with valuable experience thereof, one of its 
outcomes being the adoption of a solid counter-terrorist 
legislation, 
 
Over the years, Russia has been developing its 
counter-terrorist ties with Turkey over a wide range of 
issues, including ideological counter-terrorism.  Form 
perspective, the relations between the two countries' Muslim 
communities are of special importance.  A number of events 
have been organized in order to promote such contacts. 
 
Preparations are also underway for the establishment of the 
Russia-Islamic World Common Strategic Vision Group with a 
mission to promote peace and tolerance in all spheres, 
including education. 
 
The Dialogue Eurasia Platform of Turkey has also rendered its 
support for the international conference called "From Terror 
to Universal Ethics", which took place in Moscow in June 2005. 
 
Another important anti-terror component is the media 
cooperation.  Back in 2005, the Turkish national broadcasting 
 
company, the TRT, was represented at the "Media in the Fight 
Against Terror" international conference in Russia.  Russian 
media has been also actively involved in the process of 
consolidating the efforts for fighting radicalism and 
extremism in Eurasia (Antalya Confrence, April 2006). 
 
¶3. Summary of the discussion: 
 
Canada:  Past assistance for counter-terrorism projects in 
Turkey include Forensic Document Examination, Turkish police 
reform (including Cyber-Crime Investigative Techniques and 
Incident commander/Crisis Negotiators Course) and an Under 
cover Operations training course.  Although no projects are 
currently underway, a 15-million-dollar Counter-Terrorism 
Capacity Programme has been launched by the Government of 
Canada (including 19 government departments, administered by 
the Department of Foreign Affairs) to provide state 
assistance in areas of training, funding, equipment, 
technical and legal assistance.  The program will enable 
Canada to share our experience in border and transportation 
security; human rights and counter-terrorism training; law 
enforcement, security, military and intelligence training; 
Chemical/Biological/Nuclear Terrorism prevention, mitigation, 
preparedness, response and recovery; cyber security and 
combating the financing of terrorism. 
 
Australia:  Anti-terror cooperation with Turkey is currently 
concentrated on the data exchange and information assistance. 
 Australia listed the PKK as a terrorist organization under 
the counter-terrorism provisions of the Australian Criminal 
Code Act 1995 in December 2005. 
 
European Commission:  The European Community does not have a 
specific counter-terrorism policy nor a specific budget line 
for counter-terrorism related assistance.  The EC rather has 
a composite policy consisting of a variety of separate policy 
areas.  In the case of Turkey projects conducted in the 
context of pre-accession assistance contribute directly or 
indirectly to the strengthening Turkey's capacity in the 
fight against terrorism.  These projects are mainly conducted 
in the field of Justice and Home Affairs covering general 
Policing, Fight Against Organized Crime and Police 
Corruption, Fight Against Money Laundering and Corruption, 
Fight Against Drug Trafficking, Schengen and External Border, 
Visa Policy and Practice, External Migration and Asylum, 
Trafficking in Human Beings.  A comprehensive judicial 
modernization programme is conducted jointly with the Council 
of Europe. 
 
Spain:  In relation to the proposed separation of the Turkish 
border security service from the national gendarmerie, a 
joint Spanish-French-Turkish instruction programme has been 
 
launched focusing on the EU's existing border security 
institutions, regulations and practice, which, however, does 
not include any special anti-terrorist component.  Spain, 
together with Turkey, also co-chairs the UN "Alliance of 
Civilizations" initiative. 
 
United Kingdom:  The Istanbul terrorist attacks of November 
2003 came as a shock to everyone, but eventually gave a 
powerful impetus to the bilateral counter-terrorist 
cooperation, which by now can be characterized as extremely 
positive. 
 
Germany:  The German-Turkish anti-terrorist cooperation has 
been developing over a wide range of issues and has been 
really productive for the both sides.  Consultations on 
CT-efforts have been held at ambassadorial level.  The daily 
coordination of the ongoing anti-terror and police 
interaction activities is carried out by a resident police 
coordinator with the German Embassy in Ankara.  One of the 
practical problems that need to be tackled is that the 
terrorist extradition request files prepared by the Turkish 
authorities often do not meet the existing requirements for 
them to be accepted for examination by German courts.  In the 
case of Islamist extremist Metin Kaplan this problem was 
finally overcome.  In other cases it still persists. 
 
United States:  Military and intelligence instruments of 
national power are essential in the fight against extremism, 
but are not enough.  Law enforcement cooperation is also 
important. 
 
Operational coordination of bilateral anti-terror activities 
are conducted by a number of different agencies represented 
at the US Embassy in Ankara.  Turkey cooperates with the US 
against both international and domestic Turkish terrorist 
groups.  The problems Gerany experienced with extradition 
requests had been also the case with the US until the US 
government explained US courts' standards to Turkey.  The US 
is planning to assign to the Embassy in Ankara a Department 
of Justice European law expert to work with Turkish officials 
in developing extradition requests acceptable to European 
courts.  Other areas of counter-terrorist cooperation with 
Turkey include active police training programmes, 
nonproliferation (including the Proliferation Security 
Initiative), border security enhancement, the improvement of 
expertise over financial crimes, personnel support to the 
military's Center of Excellence - Defense Against Terrorism, 
etc.  Turkey has agreed to include Izmir in the US Container 
Security Initiative under which containers in Izmir will be 
screened before they depart port. 
 
The fight against the PKK threat is a constant element of 
 
US-Turkish counter-terrorist interaction.  While media 
reports emphasize the Turkish side's requests that the US 
step up efforts to suppress PKK activities in Northern Iraq, 
the two countries work closely together to counter PKK 
activities elsewhere. 
 
Reaching out to moderate voices in Muslim communities and 
encourage dialogue between Muslims and those of other faiths 
are also important.  We appreciate Turkey's role in the 
Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative in 
co-chairing the Democracy Assistance Dialogue, as well as its 
co-sponsorship of the Alliance of Civilizations. 
 
Japan:  Currently, Japan's cooperation is focused on 
capacity-building in the fields such as customs and 
immigration control applied to Asian countries. 
 
France:  The current bilateral cooperation on 
counter-terrorism, which includes the exchange of the related 
data, is well on track.  The problems with the Turkish side's 
extradition request files are also important. 
 
Switzerland:  In relation to the Turkish Side's requests that 
PKK should be officially recognized a terrorist organization, 
it has been noted that the existing national legal system of 
Switzerland implies that each case involving a person charged 
with terrorism should be evaluated separately, and the Swiss 
Side therefore has no such practice of preparing a 
consolidated list of terrorist organizations. 
 
Italy:  Counter-terrorist information exchange between the 
two sides has been put on the regular basis, but no special 
cooperation projects are being conducted at the moment.
