Secretary of State for African Affairs (DAS) Karl Wycoff met with 
Ambassador Mohamed Sultan Saif Al Sowaidi, Director of the 
Department of Arabic Affairs at the United Arab Emirates (UAE) 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Accompanied by Abu Dhabi Deputy Chief 
of Mission (DCM) Douglas Greene, DAS Wycoff detailed U.S. policy 
toward Somalia and the financial and materiel support provided to 
Somalia's Transitional Federal Government (TFG).  DAS Wycoff 
highlighted U.S. security concerns, including the continued 
operation of the East Africa al-Qaeda cell and its links with 
al-Shabaab.  Ambassador Al Sowaidi stated that UAE policy toward 
Somalia is in complete harmony with the U.S. and that his government 
fully supports TFG President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed.  He agreed 
with our analysis of the current fragile situation in Somalia, 
expressing the view that while Foreign Terrorist Organization 
al-Shabaab is present, it is neither strong nor deeply rooted. 
Ambassador Al Sowaidi said the UAE is ready to provide assistance to 
the TFG and work with the U.S. on actions against individuals and 
organizations undermining Somalia's transitional government.  End 
Summary.

¶2.  (SBU) As part of an ongoing effort to engage Gulf states on 
Somalia, Embassy Abu Dhabi facilitated a meeting with the UAE 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and visiting Acting DAS Karl Wycoff.  On 
June 4, accompanied by Abu Dhabi DCM Douglas Greene, DAS Wycoff met 
with Ambassador Al Sowaidi.  DAS Wycoff detailed U.S. policy toward 
Somalia and our top priorities to address the humanitarian crisis 
and improve the security situation.  He highlighted U.S. financial 
and materiel support provided to the TFG and our goal for broader 
engagement with all regions, including the Somali diaspora, to 
increase support for the TFG.  DAS Wycoff highlighted U.S. security 
concerns, including the continued operation of the East Africa 
al-Qaeda cell and its links with al-Shabaab, and stated that 
solutions to piracy are rooted in encouraging development and 
stability in Somalia. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ambassador Al Sowaidi responded that UAE's policy toward 
Somalia is in complete harmony with the U.S. and that his government 
fully supports TFG President Sharif.  He agreed with our analysis of 
the current fragile situation in Somalia and said he understood our 
concerns with al-Shabaab and Hisbul Islam.  Al Sowaidi stated that 
leaders of al-Shabaab refused offers to be part of the 
reconciliation process and that while al-Shabaab is present in all 
regions, it is neither strong nor deeply rooted.  He said that while 
these groups talk about Islam, "Islam is not part of their fight." 
Al Sowaidi said that foreigners make up at least one third of 
al-Shabaab's fighting force, coming from countries like Pakistan, 
Afghanistan and Yemen.  The Ambassador concluded that it is very 
important to assist the TFG with equipment and financial support and 
reiterated that he agreed with all of the points DAS Wycoff made.

¶4.  (SBU) Ambassador Al Sowaidi said that both the League of Arab 
States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference support the 
TFG, and the UAE is ready to provide assistance to the transitional 
government.  He said that most Arab countries support President 
Sharif.  Al Sowaidi noted the recent visit of TFG Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Abdullahi Omaar (ForMin), and lauded the ForMin as "a man 
who understands how to manage a serious business" and an excellent 
interlocutor for the TFG.  Al Sowaidi said that Omaar had a meeting 
with UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Gargash, but that he 
was not aware of the specific projects and initiatives that were 
agreed upon. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Al Sowaidi also acknowledged that the TFG and President 
Sharif have many detractors who are actively trying to undermine the 
TFG's efforts.  He agreed that Eritrea played an unhelpful role, as 
a result of its relationship with Ethiopia, but was unwilling to go 
into greater detail.  Al Sowaidi asked DAS Wycoff about the role of 
Iran which "seems to be interfering everywhere."  Al Sowaidi said he 
completely agrees with DAS Wycoff's view of the most imminent danger

being al-Shabaab's relationship with al-Qaeda.  Ambassador Al 
Sowaidi emphasized that he will urge the UAE ForMin to immediately 
act to address this threat.  He also agreed that the Government of 
the UAE is prepared to act on specific information about individuals 
and organizations based in UAE to prevent them from undermining 
President Sharif and the TFG.  DCM Greene stated that there is 
excellent collaboration between the U.S. and UAE governments in 
sharing information and that we could continue to use these channels 
to collaborate in these areas. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) DAS Wycoff concluded by thanking Ambassador Al Sowaidi for 
the unfettered access we enjoyed when engaging with representatives 
of the Somali diaspora resident in UAE, and stating that we look 
forward to continued cooperation. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Embassy Abu Dhabi has cleared on this cable.  DAS Wycoff 
has approved the release of this cable.
