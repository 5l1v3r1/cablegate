¶1. (SBU) (SBU) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed post 
that Foreign Minister Deng Alor will attend the AU Summit, most 
likely on January 28 and 29. Though he has not yet requested a 
meeting, post suggests that A/S Frazer meet with FM Deng Alor, who 
was just sworn in as Foreign Minister earlier this month.  Post does 
not know where FM Deng will stay while in Addis but will find out. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Local press reports January 22 indicated that Sudan may 
again present its candidacy for the Presidency of the AU.  This was 
vociferously denied by Presidential Advisor Mustafa Othman Ismail 
recently to PDAS Thomas-Greenfield (ref B).  MFA Americas Desk 
Director Sanusi told us January 22 that he had heard President 
Bashir might attend.  If President Bashir does not attend, the GOS 
will likely send other high-level NCP members of the government to 
the AU summit, if in fact Sudan does intend to present itself as a 
candidate for the AU Presidency.  As in the past, Sudan will likely 
not finalize its delegation until the last minute.
