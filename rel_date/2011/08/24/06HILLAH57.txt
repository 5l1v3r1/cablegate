SUBJECT: SADR RAILS AGAINST COALITION FORCES AT KUFA MOSQUE 
 
¶1. (U) This is a SET NAJAF cable. Sensitive, but unclassified. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY.  April 7, a day after a car bombing near 
Najaf's Imam Ali shrine, Muqtada Al Sadr made a rare appearance 
and conducted the Friday Sermon at Kufa mosque.  He condemned 
the "interference" of the US Ambassador in the affairs of the 
sovereign Iraqi government.  He also called on the Iraqi 
government and international organizations to set a timeline for 
withdrawal of "occupation forces". Sadr declared that Iraqis 
were prepared to secure Iraq and that in order for this to occur 
the "occupiers" need to withdraw from Iraq's city centers in a 
real and not superficial way.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A day after an explosion broke the usual calm 
surrounding Najaf's Imam Ali Shrine, Muqtada Al Sadr made a rare 
personal appearance to give the Friday sermon at the Kufa 
mosque.  Sadr began by insisting that the US Ambassador was 
meddling in the affairs of Iraqis.  He asserted that the 
Ambassador's actions and constant noise of foreign voices being 
heard by Iraq's ministers are hindering those working on forming 
a national government from concluding their work. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Sadr went on to say that there were two Iraqs; one safe 
and one not.  The "safe" Iraq, according to Sadr, is in the 
south, a portion of central Iraq and Kurdistan.  He demanded 
that the occupiers remove themselves from the cities and fully 
hand over the security authority to Iraqis.  The air space of 
Iraq, Sadr added, must also be controlled by the Iraqi 
government.  The occupying forces must receive clearance from 
Parliament or Provincial Councils before they use Iraqi air 
space, according to Sadr. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Continuing on the theme of a completely sovereign Iraq, 
Sadr insisted that the Iraqi justice system must be under 
complete Iraqi control.  He also stated that there must be 
military and security training courses conducted away from the 
hand of the occupiers.  "Leave us the most modern equipment", he 
said, "and we can defend ourselves." With the opening of the 
next parliament, the occupation forces must be given a schedule 
of withdrawal, Sadr insisted.  A brigade of Iraqi military will 
be formed to secure the central areas of the country, according 
to Sadr.  These areas are the most violent, he allowed, and 
Iraqis know best how to handle them.  "This is the path to 
stability," he noted.  Sadr closed with a demand that the 
Islamic Action Conference, United Nations, and Arab League 
create a draft agreement for the complete withdrawal of foreign 
forces.  He made no mention of the previous day's terrorist 
attack. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT. It is rare for Sadr to appear in public.  Of 
note was the lack of any statement regarding recent battles 
between coalition forces and the Mahdi Militia.  Iraqi sources 
see in these battles the beginnings of an offensive by Sadr 
loyalists. Sadr has clearly decided that he must appear 
reasonable in public appearances.  There is little doubt that, 
in private, he is conducting a campaign of disinformation and 
urging violence against coalition forces.  Sadr also made no 
mention of the attack on the Imam Ali Shrine.  It is curious 
that he would not take this opportunity to blame coalition 
forces.  Given Sadr's ongoing PR campaign, it is surprising that 
he would not talk openly about this significant event.  It was 
the "reasonable" Sadr on display during today's sermon.  Make no 
mistake however; it was the attack and Ja'afari's embattled 
prime ministerial nomination that brought Sadr out on this 
Friday. END COMMENT.
