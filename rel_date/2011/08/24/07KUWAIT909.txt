Mass Graves Update 
------------------ 
 
¶2. The 54th session of the TSC was held in Kuwait on June 5, 
¶2007. The United States opened the meeting by informing the 
attendees that the U.S. Department of State liaison to the 
U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) had 
responded to Kuwait,s revised request for satellite imagery 
research and analysis of areas in Nasseriya and Kerbala 
during a six month period from August, 1990 to February, 
¶1991.  The U.S. delegation noted that the NGA would not be 
able to provide assistance at this time because the images 
from that time period were not in a searchable database but 
would require a manual search of the NGA archives.  The 
Kuwaiti delegation inquired whether it would be useful to 
have a meeting between its technical experts and the NGA 
representative either in Kuwait or the U.S.  The U.S. 
delegation agreed to inquire on behalf of the Kuwaiti 
delegation and inform the ICRC of the outcome.  ICRC 
requested that both France and the UK investigate with their 
respective governments whether any technical assistance is 
available to assist with this matter.  The ICRC said that the 
coordinates for the possible grave sites would be delivered 
to both delegations. 
 
¶3. Regarding the possibility of visits to potential grave 
sites in Samawa, Kerbala III, Nasseriya and Najaf, the 
Kuwaiti delegation noted that many security issues would have 
to be clarified with Iraq through the ICRC before any visit 
could be considered. 
 
Witnesses 
--------- 
 
¶4.  The Iraqi and Kuwaiti delegations agreed to try to 
convince a witness with knowledge of grave sites in Kuwait, 
who is now living in Iraq, to be debriefed on site in Kuwait. 
 Kuwait reiterated that no legal action would be taken 
against the witness should he come to Kuwait.  If 
unsuccessful, the delegations will try to arrange to meet the 
witness at the ICRC office in Damascus. 
 
¶5.  Kuwait, the UK and the ICRC expressed willingness to 
assist in contacting a witness residing in London. 
 
Other Activities 
---------------- 
 
¶6.  No cases were closed, no new mortal remains were 
identified, no new information regarding new burial sites was 
received and no new exhumations were conducted since the last 
TSC meeting in February, 2007.  However Kuwait concluded that 
 
SIPDIS 
40 human remains received from Iraq did not correspond to 
either Kuwaiti or Saudi cases and would be returned to Iraq 
along with a complete file for each set of remains containing 
exact exhumation coordinates, description and photos of the 
remains and results of DNA test profiles. 
 
¶7. There was no new information on CAPT. Michael S. 
Speicher's case.  His DNA profile remains in the Kuwaiti 
database and continues to be checked against all newly 
received profiles.  The U.S. delegation renewed its 
commitment to continue the effort to resolve CAPT. 
Speicher,s case.

¶8. The next TSC meeting will take place on November 12, 2007 
in Kuwait at the Sheraton Four Points.  The next meeting of 
the Tripartite Commission will be in Kuwait on November 14, 
¶2007.  Activities to be undertaken before the next session 
are: 
 
- By July, the U.S. will contact the NGA representative about 
a possible meeting with Kuwaiti technical experts concerning 
satellite imagery analysis assistance and the ICRC will 
deliver the coordinates to the delegations from France and 
the UK. 
 
- Kuwait and Iraq will contact the witness in Iraq. 
 
- Contact with the witness in London will be pursued by the 
ICRC.  UK authorities will be available to assist if required.
