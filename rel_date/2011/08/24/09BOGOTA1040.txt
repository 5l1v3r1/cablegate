Post delivered all points in reftel on March 27 to the MFA 
Director for the U.S. and Canadian Affairs Patricia Cortes. 
We also passed a copy of the non-paper to the Government of 
Colombia's (GOC) designated representatives to attend the 
International Conference on Afghanistan at The Hague on March 
31:  Deputy Military Forces Commander Admiral David Moreno, 
and Colonel Jorge Arturo Salgado (possible future military 
attach to NATO).  GOC representatives appreciated the 
white-paper, and told us they looked forward to discussing 
Colombia's possible future role in Afghanistan at the 
conference.
