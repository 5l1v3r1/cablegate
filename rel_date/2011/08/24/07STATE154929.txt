SUBJECT: INSTRUCTION CABLE FOR USUN: CONSULTATIONS ON THE 
GREAT LAKES REGION 
 
¶1.  This is an action cable, see paragraph 2. 
 
¶2.  USUN is instructed to draw from the following talking 
points during November 13 Security Council consultations on 
the Great Lakes Region: 
 
Begin talking points: 
 
-- The United States welcomes the Government of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo's proposal to eliminate the 
threat to peace and security posed by remnants of the former 
Rwandan Armed Forces and Interahamwe militia responsible for 
the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.  We also welcome the Government 
of Rwanda's response to the Congolese proposal to disarm and 
repatriate these forces. 
 
-- We encourage both governments to continue consulting 
closely with each other and MONUC on a comprehensive plan to 
end the violence in the eastern Congo.  We urge both states 
to convene immediately the Joint Verification Mechanism to 
assist in implementing the plan. The United States, as a 
friend to both countries, stands ready to facilitate 
discussions, help with implementation, and support their 
efforts to create a stable, peaceful, and more prosperous 
region. 
 
-- The ex-FAR and Interahamwe leaders must end their military 
activities and disarm and demobilize their forces.  We call 
on all parties to respect UN prohibitions against providing 
them military or other support. 
 
-- The United States urges the Governments of Uganda and the 
DRC to ratify the Pact on Security, Stability, and 
Development signed at the International Conference of the 
Great Lakes Region (ICGLR).  We congratulate Burundi and 
Rwanda for having already ratified the Pact. 
 
-- The United States is encouraged that the Tripartite Plus 
members have agreed to normalize diplomatic relations, 
including the accrediting of Ambassadors, by September 30, 
¶2008.  The United States supports a Presidential level 
meeting among Tripartite Plus countries. 
 
-- The United States commends the Governments of the DRC, 
Rwanda, and Uganda on their commitment to negotiate 
tripartite arrangements with the UN High Commission for 
Refugees (UNHCR) on the repatriation of the remaining 
refugees. 
 
-- The United States is concerned about the destabilizing 
role played by General Laurent Nkunda and his forces in the 
DRC.  We support the Government of the DRC and MONUC in their 
efforts to disarm and reintegrate these negative forces. 
 
-- The United States strongly supports the African led peace 
talks in Juba between the Government of Uganda and the LRA 
and believes that the peace talks are not open-ended.  LRA 
forces hiding in Garamba Park in the DRC must be disarmed. 
The DRC has made it clear that the LRA is not welcomed there. 
 
End points.
