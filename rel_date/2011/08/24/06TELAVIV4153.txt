Â¶1.  The Embassy of Finland, in its EU Presidency capacity, shared 
with post the aide-memoire that the EU (plus Norway and Switzerland) 
plans to share with the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs during 
the week of October 23. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Since spring 2006, Israeli authorities have been more strictly 
enforcing entry procedures towards foreign nationals whose final 
destination is in the Palestinian Territories. As a result, hundreds 
of EU member state citizens have been refused entry. 
 
The new policy has severely hindered the movement of three 
categories of EU citizens, in particular: 
 
-- EU nationals married to Palestinians living in the Palestinian 
Territories (many of these EU citizens have lived in the Palestinian 
Territories for several years). 
-- EU nationals of Palestinian origin 
-- EU nationals working for NGOs 
 
In several cases the EU Embassies, Consulates General and 
Representative Offices have also received information about rude and 
aggressive treatment of these EU citizens both at border crossings 
into Israel and the Occupied Territories and at the Israeli 
checkpoints in the West Bank and Jerusalem. 
 
Until last spring, these people visited and/or resided in the West 
Bank or Gaza mainly with 90 day entry permits. The EU is aware that 
this category of entry should normally be used by tourists only. The 
problem is, however, that for the above mentioned people the 90 day 
visa has de facto been the only entry permit available, as the 
Israeli authorities have since 2000 been willing to consider 
requests for family reunification and long stay visa only in 
exceptional case. 
 
Some EU member state Embassies and capitals have requested more 
information about the new rules from the Israeli authorities and 
have carried out demarches on this issue.  So far the answer of the 
Israeli authorities to these inquiries has been threefold: 1). 
Israel has not changed its policy or rules of entry, but it has 
started to interpret the rules in a stricter way; 2). Israel will 
speak of this issue only on a case-by-case basis; and 3). Foreign 
nationals should apply for a permanent resident status at the 
offices of the Palestinian Authority. 
 
All countries have the right to determine their arrival procedures, 
border control and security measures, bearing in mind the demands of 
international law and commonly accepted practices. It is, however, a 
fundamental principle that other countries - and citizens of 
friendly countries travelling with a rightful purpose - are well 
informed of these rules and requirements. Also the principle of 
reciprocity is usually applied. 
 
This issue should be solved without delay. Rules and procedures 
should be public and easily available in written form to people 
planning to visit Israel and/or the Palestinian Territories. 
Detailed clarification is needed in writing of the following aspects 
in particular: 
 
-- The exact procedures foreign nationals need to go through in 
order to live, visit or work in the Palestinian Territories. 
 
-- The Israeli policy concerning the entry of the following persons 
into Israel and the Palestinian Territories: 1). foreign nationals 
holding a Palestinian ID; and 2). foreign nationals married or 
related to a holder of a Palestinian ID. 
 
-- Detailed contact information of the competent Israeli authorities 
(24 hour duty) in cases of problems. 
 
-- Possibilities and procedure to appeal in cases where a decision 
has already been given. 
 
-- What are the planned measures for creating a solid and 
transparent legal basis for the aforementioned visits and stays of 
EU nationals in the Palestinian territories.
