SUBJECT: TURKEY:  POSITIVE RESPONSE TO U.S. STATEMENT ON 
IRAN 
 
REF: SECSTATE 87682 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Following the Secretary's May 31 telephone 
conversation with Turkish FM Gul, we contacted DFM Tuygan, 
Undersecretary Uzumcu, PM spokesman Akif Beki, MFA spokesman 
Namik Tan and MFA Americas Deputy Director General Murat 
Esenli.  Their responses were uniformly positive and 
supportive.  Several noted that this was just the thing 
Turkey had been hoping the U.S. would do. 
 
¶2. (SBU) FM Gul spoke about the initiative publicly at a 
joint press conference May 31 with Russian FM Lavrov.  Asked 
for his views about the initiative, Gul said: 
 
--There are many reasons for us to be optimistic today. 
 
--Compared with yesterday, we are more optimistic. 
 
--There is a new opportunity to resolve this problem through 
diplomatic means. 
 
--We hope that this opportunity will not be missed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We pressed the Turks for a more extensive written 
statement of support and an explicit call on the Iranians to 
accept the U.S. offer.  We are continuing to talk to others 
at MFA and in government and will report further statements 
as soon as they are released.  Initial press coverage of the 
initiative has been uniformly positive.
