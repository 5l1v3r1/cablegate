(SBU) FM Spanta informed the Deputy Ambassador on May 16 that 
the May 19 trilateral summit among Presidents Karzai, Zardari 
and Ahmadinejad would be postponed indefinitely.  MFA Senior 
Advisor Davood Marodian informed us that the Pakistan side 
asked for the postponement.  The scheduling change will be a 
setback for Ahmadinejad, who reportedly hoped to host the 
summit meeting sometime prior to the June 12 presidential 
election.
