SUBJECT: ILO: CUBA AND VENEZUELA REPRISALS AGAINST 
DOMINICAN CANDIDATE TO CHAIR ANNUAL MEETINGS IN JUNE 
 
REF: SANTO DOMINGO 1597 
 
 ¶1.  Dominican Minister of Labor Milton Ray Guevara mentioned 
to EcoPol counselor on April 28 at the dedication of a Dept 
of Labor sponsored program that the Venezuelan and Cuban 
missions in Geneva are lobbying against his candidacy to 
chair the ILO annual meetings, specifically because they 
perceived that the Dominican Republic had cast the decisive 
vote on the UNHRC resolution on Cuba. 
 
¶2.  Ray Guevara said that the Canadian mission is being 
supportive, but he appeared concerned about the prospect that 
the Americas group might not put him forward as its candidate 
if the Venezuelans and Cubans persist.  He said that CARICOM 
states, previously leaning his way, are now hesitating. 
 
¶3.  Ray Guevara is well and favorably known to the Embassy 
Santo Domingo; we ask that the Department (WHA and IO) and 
Mission Geneva consider measures to counteract the campaign 
against Ray Guevara, which is to some extent a deliberately 
anti-U.S. effort.
