SUBJECT: OSCE/FSC:  15 JULY PLENARY--1540 BEST PRACTICE 
GUIDE AND GENDER ISSUES IN ARMED FORCES 
 
1.(SBU) Summary:  During the July 15 Forum for Security 
Cooperation (FSC) Russia provided information on its military 
exercises in the North Caucus military district from 29 June 
- 6 July.  The FSC heard two security dialogue presentations 
on gender issues in the armed forces.  Italy shared 
information on the results of the G8 Summit, including the G8 
statement on Non-proliferation that included a number of 
FSC-related issues, e.g., supporting implementation of UNSCR 
Â¶1540.  The U.S. provided information on Small Arms Light 
Weapons Destruction Day and the 8th publication of "To Walk 
the Earth in Safety" on landmine clearance.  Speakers, 
panelists, or moderators were requested soon for the SALW 
meeting in September.  On the margins, the Russian delegation 
provided minor comments on the two outstanding issues in the 
proposed 1540 Best Practice Guide and accepted other U.S. 
proposals.  Mission has forwarded a clean copy to Washington 
for final review -- ideally the BPG can be issued to all 
delegations next week for final endorsement in September (See 
para 15). End Summary. 
Russia Info on Kavkaz 2009 exercises - better late than never? 
2.(SBU) Russia (Ulyanov) provided information on its recent 
military exercises in the North Caucus Military District from 
29 June - 6 July.  Ulyanov said this was the major exercise 
to take place in the last two decades, however it remained at 
levels below VDOC thresholds for notification or observation. 
 The training took place in several locations, including: 
Krasnaydar, Sevastapol, Volgograd, Ingushetia, Dagestan, N. 
Ossetia, and the Chechen republic.  Approximately 8,500 
troops took part, including various units of the air force, 
air defense, Black Sea Fleet, Caspian Flotilla, Ministry of 
Interior and emergency preparedness personnel.  Equipment 
deployed included 200 tanks, 450 ACVs, 250 artillery pieces, 
and 30 interceptor/attack helicopters and aircraft.  This was 
an Army level exercise designed for emergency response 
training, both tactical and inter-service coordination and 
counter-terrorism operations.  The exercise had two stages, 
first combat readiness, and second assembling forces for 
counter-terrorism operations and protection of state 
facilities.  The Russian navy conducted exercises on the 
Black and Caspian seas regarding anti-piracy, illegal 
fishing, and with airborne forces repelled coastal landing 
forces.  The tests were for a broad set of readiness and 
mobility tasks of the new staff structure according to recent 
Russian military reform efforts. 
3.(SBU) Ulyanov closed by noting although the exercises had a 
counter-terrorism focus, some states in the region chose to 
view this exercise as an aggressive nature, and preparation 
for invasion of Georgia.  Russia is puzzled by and regrets 
this thinking, and believes it is only the product of a sick 
imagination. 
4.(SBU) Current FSC Chair (Georgia) responded on a national 
basis, confirming that Georgia had concerns about the 
training event. Georgia is willing to sign a non-use of force 
agreement with Russia but not with the "proxy" states. 
However, de-occupation should be the first priority. Georgia 
suggested resuming this dialogue in the fall session when it 
will no longer be in the Chair and can speak from its 
national seat.  Russia said it is familiar with Georgia's 
position and said the issue of non-use of force is important 
for stability in the region. 
5.(SBU) Comment:  Several delegations, including the U.S., 
had asked Russia on the margins about this exercise and 
suggested that Russia provide information on it according to 
 
USOSCE 00000167  002 OF 003 
 
 
FSC Chairman's Statement (FSC.JOUR/467/05, as well as to 
invite observers.   In contrast to the voluntary information 
provided by Spain at an FSC meeting prior to NATO,s much 
smaller PFP exercise in Georgia, Russia waited until after 
its exercise.  The information provided verbally was 
consistent with information available in the press.  End 
Comment. 
Gender Issues and the Armed Forces 
6.(SBU) The OSCE's Office of Democratic Institutions and 
Human Rights (ODIHR) introduced the two FSC security dialogue 
presentations on gender issues and the military forces. 
Copies of the "Handbook on Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms of Armed Forces Personnel" were provided, as well as 
a CD on "Gender and Security Sector Reform - Toolkit" from 
the United Nations International Research and Training 
Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) and the 
Geneva-based Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF). 
Mission has these materials available upon request. 
7.(SBU) From the operational side, Swedish General 
Engelbrekston described the importance of including gender 
issues as part of the overall force protection of his units. 
As commander of the Nordic battle group he recognized that 
addressing gender issues on a regular basis helped prevent 
scandals and negative press reporting, which takes away 
valuable time from other operational needs.  He said it is 
also useful in indentifying female leaders in the local 
community, how to approach and communicate with them.  Such 
coordination with the local female population can have a 
strategic affect on the rebuilding of the society and 
preventing further conflict.  Hence, reducing the need for 
further/future military intervention. 
8.(SBU) Second, Spanish Ministry of Defense attorney Hernando 
discussed the history of women in the Spanish armed forces 
since 1987.  She focused on various aspects of recruitment, 
promotion and retention of female service members.  Sweden, 
Greece, Cyprus, Russia, the U.S., Azerbaijan, the UK, and 
Austria spoke in support of the importance of the topic or 
offered practical questions to the speakers.  The EU issued a 
statement highlighting the importance of UNSCR 1325 of 
October 2000 that addresses the impact of armed conflict on 
women as well as the OSCE Ministerial Council Decision of 
2005 on the implementation of UNSCR 1325 for "women, peace, 
and security" in all OSCE dimensions (FSC.DEL/142/09). 
G8 Nonproliferation Statement 
9.(SBU) Italy (Landi), as recent G8 host, provided 
information of the results of the 8 July meeting, drawing 
attention to a number of resulting documents of interest to 
the FSC.  In particular, he mentioned the G8 statement on 
Nonproliferation, which includes references to further work 
on implementation of UNSCR 1540 (paragraph 9) and the Global 
Initiative for Nuclear Cooperation (paragraph 13). See 
SEC.DEL/167/09.  The U.S. (Neighbour) noted that at the G8 
meeting, President Obama called for a global meeting on March 
10, 2010 to discuss how we can work together on nuclear 
safety issues. 
SALW Destruction and APL Clearance 
10.(SBU) U.S.(Neighbour) announced that the U.S. had provided 
documents on two FSC topics:  1) the July 9 statement marking 
International Small Arms Destruction Day (FSC.DEL/140/09). 
This statement notes that since 2001, the U.S. Department of 
State has provided over $110 million to help destroy over 1.3 
million small arms and over 50,000 tons of ammunition, plus 
over 30,000 MANPADS; and 2) publication of the 8th edition of 
 
USOSCE 00000167  003 OF 003 
 
 
"To Walk the Earth in Safety" on clearing landmines 
(FSC.DEL/141/09).  This statement highlights that in 2008, 
the Department of State provided $123 million in mine 
clearance and weapons destruction in 35 countries. 
Working Group A Issues 
11.(SBU) Germany (Schweitzer) said it had received a number 
of comments on the draft decision on guidelines for VD99 
Chapter IV briefings, some of which directly conflict with 
one another.  Germany will be consulting on next steps, and 
suggested returning to the subject in September.  Note:  on 
the margins, he mentioned that Russia had posed major 
objections to the paper, and he is unsure whether there is 
any hope for finding a formula that will meet with consensus. 
 End note. 
12.(SBU) In preparation for the September SALW meeting, 
Germany informed delegations that the 2010 UN Biennial 
Chairman, Spanish Ambassador Merido has accepted an 
invitation to attend and provide a keynote address.  He urged 
other delegations to identify moderators/panelists/speakers 
by July 17 so the FSC troika can finalize the agenda before 
the summer recess.  Mission welcomes Washington participation 
and will work with Germany to ensure U.S. reps are included 
on the program. 
13.(SBU) The FSC coordinator on SALW projects (Harnell-UK) 
recalled the CPC announcement about the GRIP request to 
receive enduser certificate data from the last information 
exchange (FSC.GAL/82/09), and confirmed that the UK is 
prepared to provide its information.  Sweden also agreed to 
do so. 
14.(SBU) The FSC coordinator for Stockpiles of Ammunition 
(Petersen-Denmark) announced at the last plenary that a donor 
visit is being planned from 28 September to 1 October to the 
Crimea region in Ukraine (FSC.DEL/139/09).  The visit is 
being organized in response the October 2007 request for 
assistance in clearing the contaminated areas of Explosive 
Remnants of War.  The FSC was briefed on the project in 
December 2008 (FSC.FR/4/08).  Delegations were asked to 
submit names of interested participants by July 24.  Mission 
understands PM/WRA may be interested in attending, and we 
will forward your information to the coordinator upon 
receipt. 
 15.(SBU) UNSCR 1540 Best Practice Guide:  On the margins, 
the Russian delegation provided minor comments on the two 
outstanding issues and accepted other U.S. proposals. 
Mission has forwarded a clean copy to Washington for final 
review.  If approved, Mission will provide a clean copy to 
all delegations and work with the incoming UK FSC Chair to 
issue the draft decision next week for its final endorsement 
in September.  This has been a USG objective for two years. 
Mission strongly recommends U.S. endorsement of the draft, so 
that the U.S. can pocket this win while it is possible. 
16.(SBU) The FSC's last meeting before the break will be on 
July 22.  Russia has told the Georgians (the FSC Chair) that 
Russia intends to make a presentation "Lessons learned from 
August 2008" during the security dialogue at that meeting. 
Meanwhile, the UK has published the draft schedule of FSC 
meetings for the fall, beginning on September 9 
(FSC.INF/14/09).  In preparation for the fall, Mission 
welcomes input for security dialogue sessions already 
identified.
