¶1. SUMMARY: On September 15, Austrian Perm Rep Mayr-Harting, 
chair of the Sudan Sanctions Committee ("1591 Committee") 
updated the UN Security Council on the Committee's activities 
over the previous ninety days, including the Committee's 
informal consultations with the Panel of Experts. Ambassador 
Rice stated that the United States is troubled by Sudanese 
and Chadian sanctions violations and reports of increased 
recruitment of child solders.  No other Council members made

¶2. On September 15, Austrian Perm Rep Mayr-Harting, chair of 
the Sudan Sanctions Committee ("1591 Committee") updated the 
Council on the Committee's activities over the last ninety 
days.  Mayr-Harting reported on the Panel of Experts' (POE) 
oral briefing to the Committee and highlighted POE findings 
(NOTE: the POE is a Security Council-mandated group of 
independent experts charged with monitoring and reporting on 
Sudan sanctions. END NOTE).  The POE's report noted that the 
frequency of sanctions violations increased in Darfur during 
the reporting period (June 20-September 15, 2009).  The POE 
said that there was significant consolidation of Darfur rebel 
groups under the military leadership of the Justice and 
Equality Movement (JEM) and of Chadian armed groups under the 
Union des Forces de la Resistance (UFR), and that JEM and UFR 
heavily recruited child solders in Eastern Chad and Darfur. 
The POE also documented Sudanese and Chadian Armed Forces 
offensive military over-flights in Darfur.  According to the 
POE, the Government of Sudan is more willing to meet with the 
experts but will not answer written requests.  Finally, 
Meyr-Harting reported that the Committee received a letter 
from the UN Secretariat/Department of Peacekeeping Operations 
(DPKO) in response to concerns raised by the Committee over 
lack of information sharing and cooperation between the 
peacekeeping missions and the POE.  DPKO acknowledged these 
concerns and is developing formal guidelines to govern 
coordination. 
 
¶3.  Ambassador Rice said that the United States is deeply 
troubled by the POE's reports of offensive over-flights by 
the Sudanese and Chadian Armed Forces, and concerned that 
Darfur and Chadian rebel groups are recruiting child 
soldiers.  Rice commended DPKO's initiative to draft formal 
guidelines and reminded all parties that coordination with 
the POE is mandated by the Security Council.  Finally, Rice 
reiterated that the POE can only be effective if member 
states respect its mandate. 
 
¶4.  No other Council members made statements. 
 
¶5.  Following the briefing, Ambassador Rice, in her capacity 
as Security Council President, delivered statements to the 
press on behalf of the Council expressing support for the 
Committee's work and looking forward to the POE's final 
report (due this month).
