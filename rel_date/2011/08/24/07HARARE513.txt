REF: A. HARARE 418 
     ¶B. HARARE 133 
 
¶1. (SBU) As expected (Ref A), the ruling party won the Zaka 
East Parliamentary by-election on June 9, after both factions 
of the MDC boycotted the race.  ZANU-PF candidate retired 
Brigadier General Livingstone Chineka polled 11,162 votes 
against only 2,376 combined for two smaller parties. 
Chineka, who is resident in Masvingo, resigned from the Army 
on May 9th, two days before the nomination court sat. 
Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) staff told pol 
assistant that the polling was characterized by a low voter 
turnout - 27 percent according to observers - and by an 
unusually high number of assisted voters. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Despite the low turnout and ZANU-PF's wide margin of 
victory, ZESN field observers witnessed a number of 
irregularities, including a high number of assisted voters at 
some polling stations.  One ZESN observer reported that an 
elderly lady, who was assisted by government polling agents, 
told him that she told the Zimbabwe Election Commission (ZEC) 
officers that she wanted to vote for "any party other than 
ZANU-PF".  According to her, the officers did not follow her 
instructions.  At one polling station 68 out of the 451 
voters were assisted to vote.

Comment

¶3. (SBU) The MDC boycott all but ensured a ZANU-PF victory, 
but the participation of two smaller opposition parties gave 
this by-election a false legitimacy.  This is the second 
by-election in a row (Ref B) won by recently retired military 
officers. Combined with unconfirmed reports that army 
officers are working as ZEC officials during elections, this 
is a further indication of the trend toward militarizing the 
state.
