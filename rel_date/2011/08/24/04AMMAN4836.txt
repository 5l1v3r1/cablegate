¶1.  After a tense weekend of continued standoff among GOJ, 
Dutch and UNHCR officials (reftels), the 14 Naquora Kurds 
departed Amman on June 13 via a UN-chartered Russian plane 
and accompanied by security officials from the Iraqi Embassy 
in Amman.  According to UNHCR officials, the plane arrived 
safely at Baghdad International Airport where the Iraqi 
authorities provided onward ground transportation to Mosul. 
UNHCR and the Iraqi Embassy in Amman continue to monitor the 
Kurds' return to Mosul but do not anticipate any further 
problems with this voluntary repatriation.
