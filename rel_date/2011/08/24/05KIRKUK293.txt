¶1. (U) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION:  Sulaymaniyah airport has begun 
international operations, with weekly flights to Amman and Dubai 
via Baghdad on Iraqi Airways.  On December 10, the Turkish 
private airline Fly Air inaugurated its service to Istanbul. 
Other destinations are to be added shortly after the December 15 
elections.  Turkey has agreed to issue airport visas to Iraqi 
travelers arriving from Sulaymaniyah.  END SUMMARY AND 
INTRODUCTION. 
 
¶2.  (U) Sulaymaniyah Airport Director General Kamaran Ahmed 
Abdullah proudly told Regional Coordinator and USAID 
representative December 11 that the new Sulaymaniyah airport was 
built by a Turkish contractor in only 15 months, at a cost of 
$38 million funded entirely by the Kurdistan Regional Government 
(KRG).  He said the runway is 3500 meters long and 45 meters 
wide, made of concrete 40-cm thick.  He said the Iraqi 
Government had approved customs and immigration procedures in 
October and "last week the NOTAM office approved our getting the 
code."  The terminal, which is quite small, will become the 
domestic terminal when a larger international terminal is built. 
 Before the end of December, Fly Air will offer two flights per 
week to Istanbul, continuing on to Frankfurt and Stockholm, and 
weekly flights to Amsterdam and London.  Another carrier, 
Jupiter, is proposing twice-weekly flights to Dubai. 
 
¶3.  (U) Kamaran highlighted Turkey's agreement to issue airport 
visas to Iraqis arriving from Sulaymaniyah.  He said the 
arrangement is reciprocal, and that the Iraqi Ministry of 
Interior has been cooperative. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  With these developments, the 
KRG-Sulaymaniyah is catching up with its partner and rival, the 
KRG-Erbil, whose international airport has been functioning for 
some time.
