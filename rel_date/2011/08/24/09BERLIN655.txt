SUBJECT: GERMAN GENERAL SAYS NO THANKS TO GALILEO; ESA NOW 
WORKING DEFENSE 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  At the 3rd Annual Space Systems and 
Security Conference in Potsdam, Germany, a senior German 
officer firmly stated that his country does not anticipate 
being a customer of the European Galileo Guidance Navigation 
Satellite System (GNSS).  Separately, a European Space Agency 
(ESA) official emphasized the need to strengthen ESA,s role 
in European defense projects.  The conference was held from 
May 26-27 and featured presentations on space situational 
awareness (SSA), domestic security, Galileo, and advanced 
remote 
sensing satellites.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
GERMAN GENERAL SAYS NO TO GALILEO 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) German Luftwaffe Lieutenant General Friedrich W. 
Ploeger of the German Joint Air Power Competence Center, 
frankly told conference attendees that the German military 
"does not have a military need for Galileo."  Ploeger said 
the alliance the German military has with the USG for use of 
GPS is robust/working and remarked the German military's 
limited budget would restrict its involvement with the 
Galileo program. 
 
 
ESA ANTICIPATES GREATER ROLE IN EU SECURITY 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Dr. Thomas Beer of the ESA outlined ESA's plans to 
enter into European defense projects, a departure from its 
original charter limiting activities to the peaceful use of 
outer space.  Beer said the  peaceful use of outer space, 
clause in ESA's charter was "re-examined" and it was 
determined that nothing in this clause prevented ESA from 
participating in European defense activities, as long as 
these activities do not involve "aggressive activities." 
Beer stated that ESA now has the European legal and policy 
authorization to work on EU defense projects.
