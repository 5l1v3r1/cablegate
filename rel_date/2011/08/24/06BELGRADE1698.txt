Â¶1.  (U) DCM raised reftel points with Serbian Assistant 
Foreign Minister Sahovic, and Poloff conveyed substance of 
reftel points to representatives of the Serbian MFA as 
requested.  MFA officials noted Serbia usually supports the 
EU consensus position.  We expect they will continue to be 
sensitive to our concerns and to toe the EU line as this 
develops.
