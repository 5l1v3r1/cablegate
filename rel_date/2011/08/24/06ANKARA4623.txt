In Today's Papers 
 
CHP Slams AKP Conduct on PKK, Lebanon 
Sabah, Milliyet, Cumhuriyet and Yeni Safak:  The main opposition 
CHP leader Deniz Baykal criticized the ruling AK Party government's 
policy in the struggle against terrorism.  With regard to the 
ongoing debate about the issue of American and Turkish special PKK 
coordinators, Baykal said the real purpose of the coordinator is to 
bring Turkey to the negotiating table with the PKK.  On the Lebanon 
crisis, Baykal said the Turkish parliament must convene to adopt a 
policy regarding the growing violence in the region.  "Things are 
moving toward a dangerous point for Americans.  Anti-American 
sentiments are growing in the Islamic world.  It is unacceptable for 
Turkey to dispatch troops to join an international force for Lebanon 
before a cease-fire is secured," Baykal said.  CHP lawmaker Tacidar 
Seyhan asked in a motion submitted to the parliament whether weapons 
had been ferried to Israel from Incirlik Airbase, and whether Turkey 
had promised the US to support the Israeli operations in the region. 
 CHP deputy chairman Onur Oymen said Incirlik was a NATO base, not 
an American base, and that the alleged transfer of ammunition from 
the base to the Middle East should not be allowed.  "Turkey must 
pursue a more active policy.  Where was the Turkish foreign minister 
when several of his colleagues paid visits to Israel and Lebanon?" 
Oymen maintained. 
 
Erdogan, Hashimi Discuss the PKK, Kirkuk 
Sabah, Radikal and Zaman report Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan warned 
during a meeting yesterday with visiting Iraqi Vice President Tariq 
al-Hashimi that northern Iraq must not be a shelter for the PKK 
organization.  Erdogan urged Hashimi to take "satisfactory" measures 
against the terrorist organization.  Erdogan also stressed that 
Arabs must prevent a sectarian conflict between the Sunnis and 
Shiites in Iraq.  Erdogan maintained that the oil-rich city of 
Kirkuk must be given special status.  Erdogan and Hashimi also 
discussed opening two more border crossings between the two 
countries. 
 
Commenting in mainstream Milliyet, Guneri Civaoglu suggests that, 
instead of democracy, the US should work for stability in the Middle 
East: "After the recent developments in the Middle East, the US 
should shelve its Greater Middle East Project, started after the 
September 11 attacks in the name of democratization.  With each 
election in the Middle East either radical Islam gets the highest 
votes or, as happened in Iraq, elections lead to chaos.  In the next 
phase, the US should try to establish more pragmatic and realistic 
relations in order to create stable administrations, rather than 
democracies." 
 
Soli Ozel writing in mainstream Sabah argues that Turkey should play 
an active role in helping to stabilize the region: "As an important 
regional power and NATO member on its way to EU membership, Turkey 
can guarantee Iraq's sovereignty better than the Arab countries. 
Prior to the Iraqi war, Turkey had concerns that the responsibility 
for controlling Iran's strategic stability would end up with Turkey, 
instead of war-tired Iraq.  Now, the question is 'Will Turkey 
willingly assume responsibility for the stability of the Gulf 
Region?' 
 
Turkey to Downsize Ground Troops 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others:  Turkey's 
new Chief of General Staff appointee General Yasar Buyukanit told 
Turkish Defense and Aerospace magazine that the land forces will be 
downsized by 30 percent over the coming years as part of a 
restructuring effort under a plan entitled "Force 2014."  Buyukanit 
said the plan envisages a reduction in size but greater 
modernization of the land forces.

build a giant amusement park, a "Disneyland," on a 3 million square 
meter parcel of land in Ankara.  Prime Minister Erdogan instructed 
Ankara Metropolitan Municipality and other related state 
institutions to facilitate the process.  Construction of the USD 1 
billion theme park will be kicked off in 2007, creating 30,000 jobs.
