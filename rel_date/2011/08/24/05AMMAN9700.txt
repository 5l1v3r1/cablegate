INCREASED VOTER TURNOUT 
----------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Voter turnout increased noticeably on December 15, 
the third and last day of Iraqi election Out-of-Country 
Voting (OCV) in Jordan.  Amman-based Independent Election 
Commission of Iraq (IECI) OCV chief Hamdia al-Husseini told 
Emboff at 4:30PM that voter turnout is running at almost 
double that experienced on day two (reported Ref B), which 
saw more than 13,000 votes cast.  Husseini predicted that 
voter turnout in Jordan on day three will exceed 20,000. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Embassy Amman election observer teams visited 11 
of the 13 OCV polling sites in Jordan December 15, and noted 
substantial voter turnout.  At one site, all ten voting 
stations were in use by voters by mid-afternoon.  As on 
previous days, Embassy observers found polling operations 
proceeding smoothly and professionally in a   business-like 
atmosphere.  Observers noted that some voters brought young 
children with them to witness the event. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) IECI's Husseini expressed annoyance at repeated 
attempts at double-voting by some voters (Ref A); she 
expressed confidence, however, that most of these attempts 
had failed.  Several Embassy observers noted that IECI staff 
carefully checked voter fingers for vestiges of indelible 
ink before admitting them to the voting area, and showed 
zeal in ensuring that each voter's finger was well-dipped in 
ink before ballots were cast.  Embassy teams also noted the 
presence at polling stations of observers from the 
International Mission for Iraqi Elections (IMIE), and 
several Iraqi political parties as well. 
 
OCV-Jordan Vote Counting 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Iraq OCV voting in Jordan is scheduled to conclude 
tonight (December 15) at 8:00PM, although Husseini assured 
us that any voters still in line at that time will be 
allowed to vote.  OCV vote-counting in Jordan will commence 
at each individual voting site on Friday, December 16 at 
8:00AM.  Embassy observers will visit several of the polling 
sites on Friday to view the vote counting process.
