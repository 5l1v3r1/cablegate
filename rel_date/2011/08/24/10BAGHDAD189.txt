¶1. (SBU)  In advance of the January 25 Trade Policy Staff Committee 
(TPSC) meeting at which State, USTR, and the Department of Labor 
will consider the GSP Worker Rights petition against Iraq, post 
provides the following update on labor issues. 
¶2. (SBU) An Amman-based ILO program officer for Iraq told Econoff 
January 25 that Iraq's ILO-assisted draft Labor Code was still in 
its final review at the Shura Council (ref A), but that the ILO was 
not concerned about delay given the complexity of the issues 
addressed in the draft.  Issues include:  an overhaul of Iraq's 
fragmented Labor Code; its Occupational Safety and Health Directive; 
and, to some extent, the country's social safety net. 
¶3. (SBU) A senior Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA) 
official told us January 25 that MOLSA was following the progress of 
the draft law closely.  The official stated that until it was 
ratified, the GOI in general and MOLSA in particular, remained 
constrained by the Saddam-era Labor Code (IRQ-1987-L-4988). 
According to the Amman-based ILO program officer, however, MOLSA 
continued to work within its current legal limits to move toward 
internationally acceptable labor standards, primarily through 
regular meetings of MOLSA's tripartite committee of GOI, employer, 
and labor representatives. 
¶4. (SBU) The president of an international firm that provides 
consulting services to major investors and international 
corporations told us January 25 that, though "there are rules and 
regulations for labor standards on the books, they are rarely if 
ever used and followed."  A recent study, conducted by the firm 
identified numerous regulations and laws, a summary of which we 
provide below in response to ref C request.  The study is a 
proprietary document not for public distribution.
