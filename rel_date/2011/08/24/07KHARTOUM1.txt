SUBJECT:  Sudan/Uganda/DRC:  Special Envoy for LRA Issues Returning 
to the Region 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The UNSYG's special envoy for areas affected by the Lord's 
Resistance Army, former Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano, is 
tentatively planning return to the region January 11-22 for 
extensive consultations.  Government of Southern Sudan-brokered 
peace talks, now in recess, are expected to resume by mid-January. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to a UN briefing in Juba, Chissano's tentative 
plans include consultations in Uganda January 11-14.  The notional 
schedule for Uganda includes meetings with President Museveni, 
ethnic Acholi leaders, and the diplomatic core group (U.S., U.K., 
Netherlands, Norway and others).  Chissano's Uganda schedule also 
includes a visit to northern Uganda, probably Gulu. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Chissano will spend January 15-18 in southern Sudan, with 
plans to meet GOSS President Salva Kiir, VP Riek Machar, UN agency 
heads and both the GOU and LRA delegations to the peace talks. 
There is a chance that Chissano will travel to the Sudan-Congo 
border to meet with LRA leadership at the Ri-Kwangba assembly point 
or the neighboring Sudanese village of Nabanga.  On January 18-20 
Chissano travels to Khartoum for meetings with the Government of 
National Unity.  After Khartoum, he is slated to visit The Hague for 
consultations with the International Criminal Court (ICC). 
 
¶4.  (U) LRA chief Joseph Kony and three other senior commanders are 
under indictment by the ICC.  The ICC indictments have emerged as a 
critical issue in the ongoing peace talks, with LRA representatives 
pressing for assurances from the Government of Uganda (GOU) that the 
indictees will be protected from ICC prosecution.
