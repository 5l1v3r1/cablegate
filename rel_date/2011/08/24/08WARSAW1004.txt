¶1. (U) This message is an action request - see para 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy Warsaw is receiving more signals that the 
GoP - or elements within it - sees the failure of Doha Round 
negotiations as a point of departure for deeper U.S.-EU 
economic integration and liberalization.  In Ref B meeting 
with Charge, Deputy Prime Minister and Economic Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak (PSL) first told us of his vision of deeper 
U.S.-EU integration and of the GoP's effort to slowly, 
quietly roll back Polish opposition to biotechnology.  In a 
follow-up meeting August 21, Pawlak went much further.  He 
proposed the reform of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy 
(CAP) to break the link throughout the EU between 
agricultural subsidies and production, replacing production 
subsidies with "green box" payments based on land area and 
ecological stewardship.  Pawlak also noted standards, 
regulations, and norms as another likely area for further 
US-EU integration.  Separately, Undersecretary Andrzej Dycha 
of the PSL-controlled Agriculture Ministry reiterated to 
AgCouns Pawlak's broad message of deepening U.S.-EU trade 
integration and reported coordination between the Foreign 
Affairs, Economy, and Agriculture Ministries to that end. 
Pawlak is also interested in exploring with DOE contacts 
clean-coal technology as part of Poland's overall strategy to 
reduce its dependence on Russian energy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Pawlak will be in Washington to attend the October 
8-9 Polish-American Conference on Science and Technology.  He 
welcomed our suggestions for meetings during that trip.  We 
request the Department's assistance in setting those meetings 
with appropriate counterparts in USTR, State, DOE and USDA. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment.  Pawlak's analysis - which we share (see 
Ref C) - is that the terms of Polish accession to the EU put 
its agriculture sector at a competitive disadvantage to those 
of the EU-15.  Under the current CAP system, Polish farmers 
will never see payments as high as their EU-15 counterparts - 
an important driver of growing weakness of Poland's ag sector 
- and presumably one reason for Pawlak's newfound interest in 
CAP reform.  End comment.
