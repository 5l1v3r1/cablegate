SPEED CAMERA TO ISRAEL 
 
REF: A. STATE 125635 
 
     ¶B. OTTAWA 1511 
     ¶C. STATE 105501 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Upon receipt of ref A, we followed up ref B interim 
response with Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Deputy Director for Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Craig Weichel on September 6. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Weichel told us that Canada would not/not consider 
U.S. export authorization to Israel to be an undercut because 
the high-speed camera's specifications (ref C) preclude its 
use for nuclear explosive-related research.
