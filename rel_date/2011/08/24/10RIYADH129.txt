SUBJECT: SAUDI ARABIA RESPONDS TO HOUTHI CEASEFIRE OFFER 
 
REF: SANAA 168 
 
¶1.  (U) Speaking to the press from the Saudi border region of 
Jizan on January 27, Assistant Defense Minister Khalid bin 
Sultan responded to the ceasefire offer made by Abdul Malik 
Al-Houthi on January 25 (reftel).  He maintained that the 
Saudis had driven the Houthis from their territory prior to 
the Houthi offer of a truce, and laid out three conditions 
for an official ceasefire: the withdrawal of all Houthi 
troops, including snipers, from Saudi territory; the return 
of the six missing Saudi soldiers; and the deployment of ROYG 
troops to the border area to ensure security.  The SAG would 
view completion of these acts as "a demonstration of good 
will" by the Houthis, and would treat the conflict as in 
internal Yemeni issue. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Throughout the border conflict, the 
Saudis have maintained that they would not negotiate directly 
with the Houthis, as doing so would undercut the authority of 
their ally, President Saleh.  While responding positively to 
the offer of a cease-fire, Khalid bin Sultan's carefully 
chosen words make it clear the Saudis' support for Saleh 
remains undiminished.  END COMMENT.
