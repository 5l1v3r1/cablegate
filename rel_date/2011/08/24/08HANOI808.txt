¶1. (SBU) On July 11, the Ambassador met with Vietnamese Vice 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Pham Binh Minh to deliver Ref. A points 
on the UNSC resolution on Zimbabwe.  Minh said he read the 
U.S.-sponsored draft resolution "carefully."  Hanoi has concluded 
that the situation in Zimbabwe is not a threat to peace and security 
in Africa and as such does not support the U.S.-sponsored 
resolution, he stated.  In response, the Ambassador pointed out that 
some 25 percent of Zimbabwe's population appears to have fled the 
country and this is causing strain in the region.  Minh replied that 
Hanoi has "no interests at stake" in Zimbabwe, but it has encouraged 
the two sides to talk. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Vice Foreign Minister also complained that Washington 
had not sufficiently consulted Hanoi in crafting the UNSC 
resolution.  Giving the Government of Vietnam only 24 hours to 
consider this resolution before putting it to a vote is "abnormal," 
he added.  Minh asserted that, in the future, Washington should give 
Hanoi more time to consider UNSC resolutions. 
 
¶3. Minimize considered.
