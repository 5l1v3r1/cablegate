Attention: Manav Jain 
 
Dear Mr Jain, 
 
US SUGAR QUOTA- ZIMBABWE 
 
Your letter dated 30 January 2006 refers. 
 
The initial declared TRQ made by the USTR in respect of sugar 
for Zimbabwe was 13 953 metric tonnes raw sugar value (MTRV) 
for the FY 2006.  A further announcement made by the USTR in 
December allocated a further 3 292 MTRV to Zimbabwe.  Of this 
total tonnage 13 634 MTRV has been exported to the US on MV 
Ocean Star which sailed from Maputo on 13 January 2006.  The 
balance of the quota (3 611 MTRV) will be co-shipped with 
outstanding quotas of Swaziland, Mozambique, and South Africa 
to arrive in the US before 30 September 2006. 
 
In the event that the USTR declares further allocations 
Zimbabwe would be able to ship a further 17 000 MT of raw 
sugar to the US to arrive before 30 September 2006. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
SJ Frampton 
General Manager
