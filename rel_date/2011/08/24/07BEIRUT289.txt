SUBJECT: LEBANON: GLOBAL INITIATIVE DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 21535 
 
Polchief delivered reftel demarche on the Global Initiative 
to Combat Nuclear Terrorism to Oussama Khacchab, Americas 
Desk Officer at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who promised 
to pass the demarche points to his superiors.  Khacchab asked 
whether the USG or other partners in the Global Initiative 
would offer travel funding to national delegations attending 
the Initiative's third meeting in Kazakhstan.  Polchief 
responded negatively but promised that he would inform the 
MFA if funding becomes available.  Khacchab pledged to 
explore the possibility of the MFA endorsing the Initiative's 
Statement of Principles.  It is worth noting, however, that 
policy decisions at the Ministry have been stalled since the 
November resignation of the Foreign Minister as part of 
Lebanon's ongoing political crisis.
