¶1. (U) The trial of five suspects charged under Bahrain's 
2006 counter-terrorism law (reftels) began October 23 in 
Manama's High Criminal Court.  The three present entered 
pleas of "not guilty"; two others remain at large and are 
being tried in absentia.  The court denied a defense request 
for bail and adjourned until November 20. 
 
¶2. (U) The five face charges of membership in a terrorist 
organization, undergoing terrorist training, facilitating the 
travel of others abroad to receive terrorist training, and 
financing terrorism.  For the first time, press accounts 
connected the accused to Al-Qaeda and to carrying out acts of 
terrorism against a foreign power.  Press reporting did not 
provide names of the accused, only their ages and 
nationalities. 
 
¶3. (U) The defendants appeared in an open session of the 
court, however public access was limited to their families 
and supporters.  Media were not permitted into the courtroom 
during the proceedings.
