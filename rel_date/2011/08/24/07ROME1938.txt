International Contact Group on Somalia 
 
Rome, 10 September 2007 
 
Communique 
 
The International Contact Group (ICG) met in Rome to review 
the political, security and humanitarian developments in 
Somalia, with particular regard to the implications of the 
outcome of the National Reconciliation Congress (NRC) and the 
adoption of UNSC Res. 1772. The ICG, while recognising some 
improvements in security, expressed its concerns regarding 
the continued violence and insecurity in Somalia, 
particularly attacks by terrorists and extremists and 
targeted assassinations of those working towards peace and 
stability. 
 
The ICG welcomed the commitments of the NRC held in Mogadishu 
as well as those by President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed at the 
closing session to "pave a new political path that will win 
the confidence of the Somali people" and to continue the 
dialogue. The ICG will follow carefully further developments 
in the intra-Somali political dialogue with opposition 
groups. The ICG calls upon the Transitional Federal 
Institutions (TFIs) to implement in good faith the 
recommendations of the NRC, including the urgent drawing up 
of a road map for the remainder of the transitional period 
leading to multi-party, free and democratic elections in 
2009, as set out in the Transitional Federal Charter. 
 
Within this frame, specific provisions must be sought to 
guarantee fully the fundamental human rights as a key 
condition to the viability of the process leading to free 
democratic elections. The ICG takes note of the key role 
women play within the Somali political process, as recognized 
by the NRC, and encourages this to be intensified. The ICG 
welcomed the Res. 1772 calling for the strengthening of the 
ability of UNPOS to fulfill its role in supporting the 
political process. The ICG welcomed the appointment of the 
new UN SRSG. 
 
The ICG emphasized the continued need to address the 
deteriorating humanitarian situation, including its root 
causes, urges the TFG to do everything in its capacity to 
facilitate humanitarian access and stresses the need for all 
parties to abide by their obligations under international 
humanitarian law. The ICG stands ready to support the TFG and 
Somali civil society organizations, also by contributing to 
build up their capacity, and enhanced UN efforts to respond 
to humanitarian needs. 
 
The ICG reiterates the need for a verifiable, comprehensive 
ceasefire arrangement leading to voluntary disarmament and 
the re-establishment of an inclusive and representative 
security sector. The ICG calls on all Somali stakeholders to 
renounce violence, to participate in the political dialogue 
and reject extremists seeking to prevent a successful process. 
 
The ICG commends the role of AMISOM and calls upon countries 
to expedite their contribution of additional troops and to 
provide further funding. The full and timely deployment of 
AMISOM will help create the conditions for an Ethiopian 
withdrawal. The ICG calls for the urgent planning and 
deployment of a UN mission in Somalia.
