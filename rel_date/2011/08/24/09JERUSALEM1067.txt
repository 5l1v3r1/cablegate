Al-Ayyam leads with and Al-Quds front pages wire reports about 
Israeli Radio announcing on June 23 that Israeli Defense Minister 
Barak has authorized the construction of 300 new houses in the 
Jewish settlement of Telmon in the northern West Bank.  The 
construction will connect the settlement to a nearby outpost.  To 
make the connection, a "huge number" of acres of Palestinian owned 
land will be "confiscated," according to coverage.  State Department 
Spokesman Kelly is quoted from recent daily briefings reiterating 
that the U.S. position on settlement expansion is clear:  The U.S. 
objects to any expansion of settlements, including natural growth. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Quds lead with a WAFA story on the Israeli 
Minister of Interior's June 23 unannounced visit to the Al-Aqsa 
mosque compound, "under heavy protection by Israeli military." 
Palestinian Authority Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Abdul Qader 
called the visit, "provocative" and noted that, "Israel bears 
responsibility of the repercussions of this visit," according to 
coverage. 
 
The release of Hamas leader Dwayk on June 23 after three years in 
Israeli jail is front page news in all dailies.  Front pages also 
carry photos of Dwayk.  Abbas told press that he welcomed Dwayk's 
release and hoped to see all Palestinian prisoners released, 
according to reporting.  Dwayk noted to press that Palestinian 
prisoners are drafting a proposal that will end internal division 
and called on Fatah and Hamas to release all political prisoners 
from West Bank and Gaza jails.  Israeli authorities also released 
Fatah leader Jamal Howel on June 23 after seven and a half years in 
an Israeli jail, according to coverage. 
 
Al Quds and Al-Ayyam front page coverage on Palestinian Authority 
President (PA) Abbas opening the 37th Fatah Revolutionary Council 
session on June 23 at the PA Presidency compound in Ramallah.  In 
his opening remarks, Abbas noted that all parties must respect 
Roadmap obligations in order to reach a regional peace settlement in 
the region that will end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  Abbas 
again praised President Obama's Cairo speech and called on all 
parties to take advantage of U.S. engagement in the Middle East 
peace process, reporting notes. 
 
All front pages report on Egyptian President Mubarak's meeting with 
Russian President Medvedev in Cairo on June 23.  The two leaders 
reiterated their support for holding an international Middle East 
peace conference before the end of the year.  Medvedev also 
reiterated that Russia will exert every effort to launch peace 
negotiations in the Middle East. 
 
All front pages report on Hamas and Israel denying that there has 
been any movement on negotiations for a prisoners' exchange deal, 
calling such news, "rumors."
