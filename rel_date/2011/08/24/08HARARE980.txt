SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Both houses of Zimbabwe's parliament have now 
adjourned as they await an agreement between ZANU-PF and the 
MDC.  The more influential House of Assembly will not sit 
again until November 11, when it will take up a motion to 
investigate political violence.  Meanwhile, the prospect of 
by-elections to fill six vacant seats has been raised by the 
Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC).  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
No Business and No Money 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Zimbabwe's House of Assembly (HOA) has adjourned 
until November 11 because in the absence of an implemented 
power-sharing agreement, there is little parliamentary work 
to be done (ref).  The decision was agreed upon by both 
ZANU-PF and MDC parliamentarians and follows the decision by 
the upper house, the Senate, to adjourn until November 4. 
Acting leader of government business, Emmerson 
Mnangagwa--filling in for Patrick Chinamasa who was tied up 
in negotiations--said that the HOA could resume activities 
soner if an agreement was reached, though the failur of 
SADC Troika-hosted talks on October 27 makesthat unlikely. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Independent press repots have cited lack of funds 
as another reason forParliament's adjournment.  Parliament 
is said tohave run out of funds for accommodation and 
alloances for sitting MPs.  MPs have been funding thei stay 
in Harare out of their own pockets.  (NOTE  Parliament is a 
notoriously under-funded institution, particularly in 
comparison with governmentministries and national security 
entities.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Before the HOA adjourned, Speaker Lovemore Moyo 
overruled a ZANU-PF objection to a motion to set up a 
committee to investigate violence leading up to the June 27 
presidential run-off election.  That motion is on the agenda 
for November 11.  There was also bipartisan support during 
discussion of a motion to declare a national food emergency. 
 
-------------------------- 
By-Elections a Possibility 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The government-run daily newspaper, The Herald, 
reported on October 18 that the ZEC planned to fill the six 
parliamentary vacancies--three in the Senate and three in the 
HOA--by holding by-elections.  This would be in contravention 
of the signed power-sharing agreement of September 15 that 
stipulates a 12 month moratorium on by-elections.  However, 
the agreement has no legal effect until encapsulated as 
Amendment 19 to the Constitution and the ZEC has supported 
the position that the Electoral Act requires by-elections to 
be held 14 days after the president files official 
notification of a vacancy.  Mugabe has yet to file any 
vacancy notice. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Five of the vacancies are in constituencies that 
were represented by ZANU-PF members, and these constituencies 
can be expected to vote for ZANU-PF candidates in the future. 
 The sixth vacancy was created when Moyo became speaker.  The 
election, in Matabeleland South, will be hotly contested, 
although MDC should prevail in a relatively fair election. 
Moyo told us that as of now there is no evidence of ZANU-PF

campaigning or intimidation.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) While a by-election in Moyo's Matabeleland 
constituency would be closely contested, a ZANU-PF victory 
there would not give them legislative control as we expect a 
majority of the MDC-M MPs to vote with MDC-T on substantive 
issues.  It would be however symbolically significant because 
the MDC-T would relinquish to ZANU-PF its position as the 
largest party in Parliament.  END COMMENT.
