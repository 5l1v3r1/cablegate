¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of confirmed H1N1 infections in 
Germany increased by 627 new cases, bringing the total as of 
August 17 to 12,120.  The majority of new infections occurred 
abroad.  The German government plans to order enough vaccine 
for 80 percent of its population.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U)  At its August 17 press briefing, the National 
Reference 
Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) 
confirmed a total of 627 new (laboratory and non-laboratory) 
H1N1 cases in Germany over the week end.  This increases the 
total number of H1N1 cases to 12,120.  New cases were 
distributed among fifteen federal states: Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(196), North Rhine-Westphalia (162), Rhineland-Palatinate 
(71), Bavaria (46), Lower-Saxony (45), Hesse (29), Berlin 
(11), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (9), Saarland (8), Brandenburg 
(24), Saxony (7), Thuringia (7), Hamburg (5), Saxony-Anhalt 
(4) and Bremen (3). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, 482 of the 627 new cases are 
attributed to people returning from travel abroad.  New cases 
include also non-laboratory H1N1 cases from people who 
exhibited symptoms after being in contact with a laboratory 
confirmed infected person.  So far, all new cases are 
reportedly mild. 
 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the German state with 
the highest number of confirmed virus cases with a total of 
4,246, followed by Lower-Saxony (2,065) and Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(1,379 cases).  About 23 percent (2,746) of all confirmed 
infections in Germany have resulted from domestic 
transmission. 
 
 
H1N1 Vaccine for Eighty Percent of the Population 
---------------------------------- 
¶5. (U) The German Government announced plans to increase the 
stockpile of antiviral medication and now plans to obtain 
enough vaccine to immunize 80 percent of the population, up 
from its prior plan to immunize approximately one-third of the 
German population.  According to the media, an inoculation 
rate of over 80 percent is necessary to stop the spread of the 
virus.   Germans, however, tend to be vaccine-adverse.  Media 
reports indicate that fewer than 80 percent are likely to get 
immunized against the new virus.  (Note:  Only 22 percent of 
the population in Germany follow the annual recommendation and 
gets vaccinated against seasonal influenza.)  However, if the 
inoculation rate is less than 80 percent, the Government could 
sell excess serum abroad, according to media reports. 
 
¶6. (U)  In order to produce enough "Pandenrix", the new H1N1 
antiviral medication, Dresden-based pharmaceutical company 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) plans to hire an additional 150 workers. 
GSK currently employs 700 workers.  The production of 
Pandenrix began in July. GSK will produce over 300 million 
vaccine doses by fall and will be sent to Europe and parts of 
Asia.
