SUBJECT: RDFF ACCUSES GSE OF COLLABORATING WITH JEM 
 
¶1. (SBU) The leader of a small Darfuri rebel group is 
suspicious of Eritrea's interest in Darfur.  Salah 
Abdurrahman Abualsurra, president of the Revolutionary 
Democratic Forces Front (RDFF), an Arab-aligned Darfur 
movement, told poloff the group is skeptical of Eritrea's 
interest in Darfur.  "Every government in the region simply 
wants to maintain power" he stated, "including the Eritrean." 
 He told poloff the Eritrean government (GSE) is not 
interested in seeking peaceful solutions to Darfur, and only 
wants to protect its interests.  "JEM is Eritrea's first line 
of defense" he claimed.  Regarding other larger Darfuri 
groups, such as the Sudan Liberation Army, he speculated the 
GSE wishes to incorporate them under the JEM banner.  He also 
claimed the GSE maintains close ties with Chad in order to 
support JEM and safeguard itself against Sudan. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mr. Abualsurra also outlined RDFF's three-tiered 
strategy for international engagement in Darfur.  In an ideal 
scenario, the African Union would take the lead on organizing 
grassroots dialogue among community members within Darfur. 
The European Union (EU) would handle bilateral engagement 
with neighboring countries based on colonial ties (i.e., 
France would pressure Chad to cease support for rebel 
groups).  The United States would oversee the entire 
operation, providing logistical and financial support where 
needed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As for RDFF's own power base, Mr. Abualsurra claimed 
the RDFF had recently aligned four other Arab groups under 
its lead in Juba.  He also accused JEM of "not even being 
representative of the Zagawan ethnic group."  JEM mostly 
consists of Chadian Zagawans, he elaborated. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Finally, Abualsurra told poloff about a recent RDFF 
meeting with Abdella Jabir, the Eritrean political party's 
Sudan specialist.  According to Jabir, "Scott Gration is 
welcome at any time in Eritrea, but the United States 
constantly seeks to sideline us from the discussions." 
Abualsurra remained skeptical of Jabir's sincerity, but 
passed the information along as a courtesy. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  In recent months, the GSE has shifted 
support from small Darfuri groups such as RDFF to larger 
entities like JEM.  Abualsurra's bitterness towards the GSE 
mirrors the sentiments of other resident Darfuris who feel 
the GSE has abandoned them.  The GSE's increase in support 
for JEM likely stems from Sudan voting with the AU to 
sanction Eritrea.  The support for JEM may also reflect the 
GSE's concern about renewed violence in the east following 
the 2010 elections and another north-south conflict after the 
2011 referendum.
