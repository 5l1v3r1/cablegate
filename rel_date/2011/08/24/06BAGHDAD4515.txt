SUBJECT:  NINEWA: ENGAGING THE LOCAL PRESS 
 
 
This is a Ninewa Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) message. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.(U) The Ninewa PRT hosted a group of local reporters for an 
on-the-record discussion with Team Leader Knight on 25 November, 
¶2006.  Representatives of seven news organizations attended, 
including local and international journalists.  Topics addressed 
Ninewa's economic recovery and the impact of U.S. Congressional 
elections on U.S. efforts in the province.  There were few surprises 
arising from the discussion, but all participants agreed that more 
regular PRT press events should be scheduled.  We hope to use this 
beginning to advance our Public Diplomacy program.  END SUMMARY 
 
----------------------- 
FOCUSING ON LOCAL MEDIA 
----------------------- 
 
2.(U) On November 25, 2006, PRT Team Leader Knight spoke at length 
with seven locally resident reporters, including representatives of 
Baghdadiya Satellite TV, Civil Society Journal, Middle East Journal, 
Nahrain Satellite TV, al-Hurra Satellite TV, Associated Press, and 
the Chine News Agency.  Team Leader Knight is the first Ninewa PRT 
Team Leader to speak to local journalists on-the-record, and this 
press event marked a significant engagement with local media.  This 
event was also cleared for on-the-record with western press by PA in 
Washington, working through Embassy Public Affairs Section. 
Attendees were enthusiastic participants in this press event and 
requested that similar on-the-record discussions be scheduled 
monthly. 
 
--------------------- 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
--------------------- 
 
3.(U) This press event was restricted to Iraqi-American relations as 
manifest in Ninewa and Provincial reconstruction.  Most questions 
concerned Ninewa's economy, Provincial and Coalition reconstruction 
efforts, and the impact of U.S. Congressional elections on U.S. 
policy in Ninewa.  The tone of the event was friendly and 
inquisitive. 
 
4.(U)  Team Leader Knights' responses to reporters' queries focused 
on rebuilding from neglect to Ninewa by the former regime and the 
PRT's efforts to build capacity and assist economic recovery in the 
province.  He detailed ongoing reconstruction projects, steps to 
contain corruption in reconstruction efforts, and Ninewa's economic 
future - including the PRT's work to resolve ongoing problems of 
fuel shortages and limited power.

MEDIA PRESENTATION 
------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) These journalists placed filmed coverage of this discussion 
on satellite television channels noted para (2).  Several indicated

Baghdad's Public Affairs Section as they become available.  End

COMMENT 
-------- 
¶6. (U) To the extent reasonable, out PRT hopes to respond to the 
Ninewa media corps' request for more frequent on-the-record 
discussions related to out work in Ninewa.  This meeting was 
certainly a resounding success - future press events will strengthen 
our relationship with local media and become integral to our PRT's 
media outreach program.  END COMMENT.
