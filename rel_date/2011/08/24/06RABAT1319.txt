 ¶1.  This cable is in response to the request in Ref A on the 
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR). 
 
¶2.  The information on Morocco contained in Ref A is 
inaccurate now.  The National Human Rights Documentation, 
Information and Training Center still exists, but as of two 
years ago, it no longer is the focus for human rights issues 
including those relating to the judiciary, democracy and 
civil society.  Refs C through G discuss the current 
situation in Morocco.
