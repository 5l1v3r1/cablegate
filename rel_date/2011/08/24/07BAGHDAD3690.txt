¶2. (U) BEGIN TEXT: 
 
The Honorable George W. Bush 
President of the United States of America 
The White House 
Washington DC. 
 
November 4, 2007 
 
Dear Mr. President, 
 
No matter what challenges we face here in our new 
democracy I have always been certain of one thing: the strong, 
unflinching support of your leadership and the devoted friendship of 
the people of the United States. 
 
The rising tension resulting from ongoing conflict 
between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) 
causes me to write today.  The Prime Minister of 
Turkey, Recap Tayyip Erdogan, is arriving in the 
United States to meet with you, to discuss what 
actions Turkey and possibly the United States 
should take to deal with increased violent actions 
by the PKK.  So I ask you, as a friend and fellow president, to help 
us persuade Turkey not to invade 
Iraq, an action that would destabilize the Kurdistan Region, the 
most stable and prosperous part of Iraq. 
 
There is no doubt in my mind that Prime Minister 
Erdogan is genuinely seeking peaceful solutions to 
problems raised by the violence.  We understand 
Turkey's frustration with the actions of the PKK. 
We are just as frustrated.  However, we sincerely 
believe that the only way to solve this long-running problem is 
through honest dialogue not further 
violence or international conflict. 
 
My government and the Kurdistan Regional Government 
have reaffirmed their commitment to resolving the 
issues we share with Turkey in a peaceful, non 
violent way.  Our efforts to secure the release of 
the Turkish hostages, as well as our steps to close 
down PKK front offices, better defend our borders 
and restrict PKK movement are all indications of our sincere 
commitment to good neighborly relations. 
 
We want to keep building our positive relations with 
our friends and neighbors.  In that spirit, I would 
be deeply grateful for your continued efforts to 
encourage all parties to deal with these issues in diplomatic and 
no-violent ways. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Jalal Talabani
