¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end-

license application: NLR as the ultimate consignee of 
a 5200 trivector analyzer system and accessories. ECCN

conducted the requested post-shipment verification 
with Kaluga Brewer Company, Kaluga, Russia. The export 
control team met with Sergey Burykin, Chief Engineer. 
 
¶4. KPK was founded in 1998 from assets of a Soviet era 
brewery acquired by SAB Miller PLC, a multinational 
group headquartered in the U.S. The brewery is SAB 
Miller's third largest, and last year was honored by 
the holding company as having the most efficient 
brewing operations outside of the United States.  KPK 
produces around 300,000,000 litres of beer annually. 
KPK employs around 1000 at the brewery, located in 
Kaluga, a town approximately 200km southwest of 
Moscow. 
 
¶5. The commodities in reftel are used by the 
Engineering Service of KPK to analyze oils used in the 
brewery machine equipment.  Oil samples are taken from 
various mechanical devices, and tested for 
preventative maintenance purposes.  In conjunction 
with vibration analysis, the engineers can determine 
the projected lifespan of the device, potential 
problems or malfunctions, and prevent damage from oil 
contamination.  It also allows the company to ensure 
that oils and lubricants procured for use are suitable 
and in good condition prior to use. 
 
¶6. The team was shown a CSI model B520000 tri-vector 
analyzer with model 52DV viscometer, serial number

grounds of the factory.  In addition, the manager of 
the Engineering Service has access to the trailer, 
along with a janitor. The factory runs on a 24 hour 
basis, and has its own security service which is on 
duty at all times.  There is a video security system, 
and doors are routinely checked by security patrols 
during nighttime hours. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Kaluga Brewer 
Company, Kaluga, Russia as reliable recipients of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
