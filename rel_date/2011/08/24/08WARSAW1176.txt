REF: SECSTATE 104974 
 
¶1. (SBU) DCM and Legatt delivered reftel demarche to Lukasz 
Redziniak, Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of 
Justice (MOJ) October 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) DCM took the opportunity to raise our 
disappointment in the outcome of a Polish court case 
involving Randy Craig Levine, who allegedly committed fraud 
in the United States and acquired Polish citizenship to avoid 
extradition to the United States.  A Polish court recently 
rejected a U.S. extradition request on the basis of Levine's 
newly acquired Polish citizenship, despite the existence of a 
2006 Polish constitutional amendment that appears to enable 
such extraditions.  Redziniak expressed MOJ frustration with 
the judge's decision and said that the Polish government 
plans to appeal the case to the Supreme court, for which the 
DCM expressed appreciation.
