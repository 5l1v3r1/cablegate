SUBJECT: ROYG CABINET SCRAPS CONTROVERSIAL NUCLEAR AGREEMENT 
 
REF: SANAA 1095 
 
On October 30 the ROYG announced that, during its weekly 
meeting on October 29, the Cabinet refused to endorse 
controversial reftel agreement between the US company Powered 
Corporation and the Ministry of Energy and Electricity.  The 
decision came one day after reports that the Supreme National 
Authority to Combat Corruption (SNACC) asked Prime Minister 
Ali Mujawar to halt the agreement until the SNACC could 
investigate the matter further.  A Cabinet statement explains 
that the decision was taken after "the publication of 
information that the company is not qualified to carry out 
the reactors project." COMMENT: The lack of endorsement by 
the Cabinet effectively "scraps" the agreement. END COMMENT.
