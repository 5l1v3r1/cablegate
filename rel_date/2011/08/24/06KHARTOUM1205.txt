¶1.  Summary.  A growing number of diplomatic mission of 
various description have arrived in Juba, with others 
waiting in the wings.   By the end of 2006, we expect as 
many as seventeen representations of various description 
could be present here.  The lease/construction of office 
space and residential quarters poses a major challenge 
for countries interested in operating in the South Sudan. 
End summary. 
 
----------------------- 
Already on the Ground 
----------------------- 
 
¶2.  Listed below in order of arrival are countries and 
organizations already operating in Juba, to exclude the 
omnipresent specialized agencies of the UN. 
 
-- Uganda:  The Ugandan CG presently consists of two full- 
time staff lodged in a cramped two-room bungalow of the 
Juba Hotel.  The Ugandan CG, who has no house, is rarely 
in Juba unless he is accompanying visiting high-level 
delegations. 
 
-- US: We have been officially present since January 3. 
 
-- Kenya:  Three Kenyans arrived in February 2006 to 
begin renovation of a residence and office.  The CG 
designate has visited but is not yet resident. 
 
-- Egypt: There are six Egyptians living in a small 
apartment above a bank.  The Egyptians withdrew following 
the fatal confrontation between Sudanese refugees and 
Egyptian security forces late last year, but they 
returned in early April.  The new Egyptian CG is 
Abdelghaffar Eldib, formerly Cairo's ambassador to 
Lusaka. 
 
-- Joint Donor Office: More of a development than 
diplomatic entity, the Joint Donor Office includes 
representatives of the UK, Holland, Sweden, Denmark and 
Norway.  Germany and Japan are also reportedly 
considering participation.  Liz Gaere, a British citizen 
seconded from DFID, arrived in mid-March.  Overseen by a 
Dutch contractor, construction of an office/residential 
compound proceeded in record time and is due to be 
officially opened on May 29. 
 
-- UK:  A single UK "antenna" operates on foot from a 
tent in the AFEX camp, transplanted from Rumbek in early 
¶2006. 
 
-- Holland:  The single Dutch representative, another 
Rumbek transplant, departed in late April but will 
reportedly be replaced.  There are talks of creating a 
joint consular facility that would include Holland, the 
UK and possibly others.

On the Way

¶3.  The following countries plan beginning operations in 
Juba in the near future: 
 
-- Eritrea:  CG encountered former Eritrean Charge to 
Khartoum Negash, who informed that he will serve as the 
Eritrean Charge in Juba as soon as accommodations are 
available. 
 
-- Norway: A lone Norwegian who lived in the AFEX camp 
was medevaced in late 2005, but a three person Norwegian 
Consulate is slated to open next month.  They have leased 
and are rehabilitating two buildings that belong to the 
Archdiocese of Juba, including a nice residence. 
 
-- South Africa:  The South Africans plan to open a 
facility in June.  CG met with an advance team in March, 
and South Africa's Ambassador to Khartoum visited last 
week to officially announce the arrival.

-- France:  The French Ambassador and a delegation that 
included Jacques Gerard, the French "representative" in 
Juba, arrived on May 17.  The French plan to place Gerard 
in Juba soon but as yet have not accommodations or office 
space. 
 
-- EU:  The EU received permission from the Government of 
Southern Sudan (GoSS) to take back a former EC project 
headquarters formerly held by Eastern Equatoria state, a 
site adjacent to the USAID office complex.  Renovation 
has not begun; the actual arrival date is unknown. 
 
------------------ 
Rumored on the Way 
------------------ 
 
¶4.  These countries may open some type of facility in the 
near future. 
 
--India:  The Indian Ambassador told the French 
Ambassador that India will open an office in Juba. 
Details unknown. 
 
--Ethiopia:  The Ethiopians will send their former 
Ambassador to Kampala to open a consulate in Juba, 
according to the GoSS Ministry of Regional Cooperation. 
 
-- Libya:  Negash told CG that Libya plans to open a 
representation in South Sudan.  Timing and details 
unknown. 
 
-- Zimbabwe:  CG ran into former Zimbabwean MFA Protocol 
Director and current ambassador to Kampala and another 
official from Harare in March.  They confirmed that 
Zimbabwe is interested in opening an office to take 
advantage of potential trade and commercial 
opportunities. 
 
-- Democratic Republic of Congo:  According to the 
Ministry of Regional Affairs, DRC has expressed its 
desire to come to Juba.  GoSS Regional Affairs Minister 
Nhial Deng Nhial will reportedly visit Kinshasa to 
discuss the details. 
 
¶5.  There could be as many as seventeen diplomatic 
offices of one description or another operating in Juba 
by the beginning of 2007.  Currently, the principal 
challenge is finding adequate residential and office 
space, which runs at a premium in the tight real estate 
market of Juba.  There is increasing informal contact 
between the various countries/groups represented, and the 
Egyptian CG has suggested some sort of ad hoc diplomatic 
group, with the U.S. CG as the de facto dean, with all of 
four and a half months of Juba experience under his belt.
