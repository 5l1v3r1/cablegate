7 June 2009 
 
Excellency, 
 
I am writing to express my deep appreciation for the message 
of President Barack Obama to the Muslim and Arab worlds in 
his speech of 4 June 2009 at Cairo University. 
 
President Obama's speech presented a much needed fresh 
approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict. It stems from the need 
for taking bold steps, especially freezing settlement 
activities, in order to pave the way for a productive peace 
process. It also considered the Arab Peace Initiative as an 
important basis for achieving comprehensive peace in our 
region. 
 
The speech set the record straight in highlighting the 
historical role of the Islamic civilization. It was an 
important recognition that provides a solid foundation for a 
future relationship between the West and Islam built on 
understanding, mutual respect and common interests. 
 
We, in the League of Arab States, welcome this approach by 
the United States. 
 
I hope that we can arrange a meeting in the near future to 
discuss ways and means of having a meaningful and in-depth 
dialogue between the United States and the Arab world on the 
different areas mentioned in the President's speech. I am 
ready to send a delegation of high officials from the 
Secretariat of the Arab League to Washington to discuss the 
way forward in this regard. 
 
Sincerely, 
Amre Moussa 
 
 
H.E Mrs. Hillary Clinton 
Secretary of State, 
The United States of America
