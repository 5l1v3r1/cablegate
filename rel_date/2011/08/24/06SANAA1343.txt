SUBJECT: YEMEN IMPLEMENTATION OF BOYCOTT STATUTES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 66895 
 
¶1. In response to the Department's request for updated 
information on Republic of Yemen (ROYG) adherence to the Arab 
League Boycott of Israel, post conducted a review of ROYG 
enforcement and compliance practices in place regarding the 
boycott. The results of that review are as follows, and are 
keyed to reftel questions. 
 
¶2. The ROYG, represented by the Ministry of Industry and 
Trade (MOIT), regularly takes part in the ALB annual meetings 
in Damascus.  In 2004, Yemen took part in the meeting of the 
Islamic Bureau Boycott in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.  Officially, 
MOIT maintains a blacklist of Israeli companies and foreign 
companies that contribute to Israel's defense or economic 
development. Any U.S. firm can conduct business in Yemen 
unless they are blacklisted.  MOIT requests ALB certificates 
from companies currently or previously blacklisted by the 
ALB. 
 
¶3. The ROYG does not as a matter of policy, practice, or 
contract request that U.S. firms comply with boycott 
requirements or provide information regarding such compliance. 
 
¶4. Suppliers, vendors, and service providers with whom post 
typically does business in Yemen are known to comply with the 
ALB or international boycotts. 
 
¶5. There are no boycott laws in Yemen. 
 
¶6. There is no agency or office representing the ALB or any 
boycott organization per se in Yemen.  However, the MOIT has 
on its premises a designated ROYG employee, working in the 
Foreign Relations Department, who looks after ALB issues in 
Yemen.  He follows up on all ALB-related business, gathers 
data requested by ALB, distributes ALB recommendations to 
respective bodies, and reports to ALB on all relevant issues. 
 
¶7. The ROYG does not take steps to correct or prevent 
instances of attempted boycott enforcement by government 
agencies or ALB compliance requests by private entities.
