STRATEGY FOR VICTORY IN IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 217743 
 
(SBU)  As the only other country in the Western Hemisphere 
participating in the coalition in Iraq, El Salvador is an 
active supporter of U.S. policies in the region.  Copies of 
President Bush's National Strategy for Victory in Iraq were 
given to Minister of Defense General Otto Romero and to Luis 
Mario Rodriguez, Judicial Secretary to President Saca.  The 
National Strategy for Victory in Iraq received coverage in 
the two leading dailies, La Prensa Grafica and El Diario de 
Hoy.  The newspapers provided the coverage on December 1, as 
part of their regular reporting on international events, 
rather than as a feature story in the front of the paper.
