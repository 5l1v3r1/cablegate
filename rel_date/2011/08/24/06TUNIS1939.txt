QANA BOMBING 
 
REF: TUNIS 1924 
 
All papers carried July 31 an official GOT release stating 
that, in a sign of solidarity with the Lebanese people, there 
would be a national three day mourning period.  According to 
the press release, "Tunisia is profoundly shocked and 
concerned by the horrible massacre perpetrated by Israel in 
Qana, in deliberately bombing innocent civilians, a majority 
of whom were children, women, and  elderly, in doing so 
violating humanitarian principles, international law and 
charters."  The press release called for influential members 
of the international community to impose a cease-fire, and to 
dispatch an international peacekeeping force in southern 
Lebanon.  The Ministry of Culture announced that due to the 
period of mourning, all cultural festivals and events would 
be postponed for three days.  (NOTE: Many such events were 
canceled rather than delayed due to artists' schedules, 
including performances at the prominent Carthage Festival. 
Embassy PA cultural programming was also affected, as a trio 
of visiting bluegrass musicians was not able to perform two 
concerts in Sfax and Mahdhia.)
