REF: A. SECSTATE 46997 
 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 45792 
 
¶1. (U) We plan to distribute an IIP-prepared package of 
appropriate written materials on the topic to the local press 
and other key contacts. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Tunisia has no known exiled Cuban community and the 
topic of Cuba in general has no resonance with the Tunisian 
public, except in the context of Guantanamo Bay.  The 
Government of Tunisia tightly controls activities by foreign 
missions and would not permit a public event on the topic of 
Cuba.  Tunisia was included with Cuba by the White House in 
its recent statement for Press Freedom Day.  The 
tightly-controlled Tunisian print and broadcast media markets 
will provide few openings to raise awareness or initiate 
debate on the topic of Cuba, much less prison conditions, a 
sensitive subject here.  Raising the topic would instead 
invite a renewed flurry of negative reports on U.S. practices 
in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, and none on Cuba.
