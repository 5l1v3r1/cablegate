¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Cuban assistance to Haiti after the 
earthquake consists primarily of mobilizing doctors and 
nurses already in country, supplemented by teams of Cuban 
doctors who specialize in emergency medical assistance.  Cuba 
is also transporting Haitian doctors who studied in Cuba and 
Haitian medical students still training in Cuba back to Haiti 
to assist in the medical response.  The Government of Cuba 
granted a U.S. request for overflight permission to assist 
with medical evacuations, and has publicly indicated a 
willingness to cooperate further as needed. END SUMMARY 
 
CUBAN AND CUBAN-TRAINED DOCTORS 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Cuba's immediate response to the January 12 earthquake 
was to point to the 403 total Cuban "collaborators" already 
in Haiti at the time of the earthquake, 344 of which are 
doctors and nurses working as part of Cuba's medical 
diplomacy efforts.  Most of the Cuban health professionals 
already in Haiti specialize in primary care or ophthalmology. 
 Over the course of the next few days, Cuba sent 60 more 
doctors as part of Cuba's "Henry Reeve Contingent of Doctors 
Specialized in Disaster Situations and Serious Epidemics" 
(Note: the Henry Reeve brigades were established in September 
2005 as part of the GOC's offer of medical assistance to the 
United States following Hurricane Katrina.  End Note.) 
 
¶3.  (U) The GOC has arranged for the return of 32 Haitians 
who graduated from the Cuban Medical School in Santiago de 
Cuba and is in the process of sending several more teams of 
Haitian medical students currently training in Cuba back to 
Haiti.  The Cuban press notes that nearly 500 Haitians have 
graduated from Cuban medical schools.  The Cuban press has 
also reported the delivery of at least 10 tons of medical 
supplies to Haiti, including medicines, food, serums, and 
plasma. 
 
¶4. (U) The Cuban doctors and nurses are concentrated in four 
Haitian field hospitals located in or next to: 1) Ofatma, a 
facility within the Military Hospital facilities; 2) 
Renaissance Ophthalmology Center, a facility used for the 
joint Cuban-Venezuelan eye-surgery program Operation Miracle; 
3) The Peace University Hospital (also called Delmas 33); and 
a facility in Leogane.  Cuban doctors are also providing 
emergency services in the neighboring departments of Aquin, 
Mirebalais, Grand Goave, Anse-a-Veu and Raboteau. 
 
WORKING WITH THE USG 
-------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On February 13, the GOC granted overflight 
authorization for U.S. planes to carry out medical 
evacuations from Haiti in accordance with a 2005 bilateral 
agreement.  On January 15, North America Director in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Josefina Vidal told the press 
that Cuba "is disposed to cooperate with every country 
operating in Haiti, including the United States, to help the 
Haitian people and save lives."  Similar remarks were also 
made at the United Nations. 
 
PRESS COVERAGE AND COMMENTS ON U.S. ASSISTANCE TO HAITI 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶6.  (U) The earthquake continues to dominate the local Cuban 
press with mostly factual reporting from Haiti, including 
initial plans for U.S. assistance.  Over the weekend, the 
press started quoting complaints from France, Brazil, 
Nicaragua, and CARICOM regarding the "arbitrary handling by 
the United States of the Haitian airport, denying on repeated 
occasions landing permission to aid flights."  An "opinion" 
article on January 18 criticized President Obama's 
appointment of former president George W. Bush to co-direct 
an aid fund for Haiti as "cynicism without limit."  Communist 
Party leader and former president Fidel Castro has written 
two reflections on Haiti highlighting Cuban assistance and 
linking the earthquake to climate change and the "mockery, 
scorn and deception in Copenhagen" (reftel).

CUBANS AFFECTED 
--------------- 
 
¶7.  (U) Shortly after the earthquake, Cuba issued a tsunami 
watch and evacuated more than 30,000 people from the eastern 
city of Baracoa "within hours."  Despite the proximity, Cuba 
did not feel the earthquake or any of the aftershocks.  The 
GOC has reported no deaths and three injuries suffered by 
Cubans in Haiti, including one student who remains in 
critical condition after being evacuated to a hospital in 
Santiago de Cuba.
