SUBJECT:  Iraq Generates 5000 MW of Electricity - ITAO Project 
Update 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY. On June 7, 2007 electricity peak production in Iraq 
achieved a milestone of 5000 MW and on the next day production 
reached 5208 MW.  After a short downturn, over 5000 MW was again 
attained on June 13th and 14th.  These are the highest production 
levels since August of 2006 and represent a sustained climb from the 
low point below 4000 MW in January 2007.  This achievement 
highlights the collaborative work of the GOI and USG on 
infrastructure in Iraq.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  The deficiency in the Iraq electric power system is that 
production is rising, but is chasing after rapidly increasing 
demand.  Many years of economic sanctions and isolation from Western 
technology contributed to severe deterioration of the power utility 
infrastructure.  Ongoing challenges include major breakdowns, 
interdictions of transmission lines and lack of fuel.  U.S. and 
coalition partners are directly adding over 2000 MW to the Iraqi 
system. 85% of the new capacity will be on line by the end of 2007. 
More importantly, the reconstruction efforts have emphasized to the 
Ministry of Electricity the importance of long term operating and 
maintenance principles. 
 
¶3.  Coalition Forces have focused on providing adequate security to 
achieve quick repairs to transmission lines while USG and GOI 
personnel expedite the repairs.  Increased generation and reliable 
distribution are part of a strategy to get more power into the 
Baghdad ring in order to provide essential services to citizens and 
businesses. At the same time, the provinces are receiving more power 
through the national grid than they ever did during Saddam's time, 
when the sole priority was power for Baghdad.  Our current objective 
is to spur economic activity and enhance the quality of life for 
Iraqis, particularly as the surge becomes more successful in 
reducing and eliminating violence. 
 
¶4.  The Minister of Electricity, Dr. Karim, specifically has been 
pressing his organization to put as much generation on line as 
possible for the summer months.  Dr. Karim meets several times a 
week with ITAO and GRD project managers to monitor the highest 
priority projects.  5000 MW is only a stepping stone towards his 
goal to routinely produce 6000 MW in time for the peak season 
occurring in late July through early September.  We believe this 
goal is achievable. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  It is worth noting that the 5000 MW level has been met, but it 
may well fall back below that level in the short term.  Fuel supply 
problems and insurgent attacks can take power off-line at any time. 
However, the essential fact is that more power is being produced in 
Iraq than it was during Saddam's time and the trend is upward: 
increased power will become available over the next year and beyond. 
 The challenge will be to meet the rapidly increasing demand for 
power from consumers and new economic activity.  We will focus on 
assisting the Ministry of Electricity with its planning, its 
operations management, and its budget execution to equip it to meet 
the challenge.
