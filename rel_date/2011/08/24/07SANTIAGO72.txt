SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - IRAQ 
 
On January 12, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 
101,000) ran an editorial entitled "A New Stage in Iraq."  Quote: 
 
"The U.S. President's announcement does not represent a radical 
change in the strategy towards Iraq but rather a necessary shift in 
the way of facing the problem....  In addition, the plan insists on 
the need to remain in Iraq and strengthen the military presence.  A 
decision has been taken in spite of the rejection it generates among 
Americans...and which aims to correct the path, because a unilateral 
withdrawal would create a void in that country that could have 
unpredictable consequences in all the region." 
 
On January 12, government-owned, editorially independent "La Nacion" 
(circ. 4,200) ran an opinion column by international analyst Raul 
Sohr entitled "Contradictory Counterinsurgency." 
 
"The military hate counterinsurgency operations....  The worst 
nightmare for a regular army is to have to maneuver in a very 
populated city seeking an invisible enemy.  And that is what U.S. 
troops are facing in Baghdad....  Bush has to show results in order 
to reverse a war that he is not only losing on the battlefield but 
in the public opinion....  Ignoring the political aspect of a 
confrontation while focusing on military problems...is the mistake 
that the United States has made until now.  Nothing indicates that 
there are real conditions for a new long-term strategy."
