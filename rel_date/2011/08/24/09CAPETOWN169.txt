SUBJECT:  PROTESTS OVER LACK OF HOUSING CONTINUES 
¶1. (U)  On July 30, 2009 about 300 people gathered at the entrance 
to Masiphumelele, an informal settlement near Fish Hoek in the 
Southern Suburbs of Cape Town to protest against lack of housing. 
The protesters blocked Kommetjie Road obstructing access to 
 
motorists on their way to work and burnt tires and stoned pa3@tuQZ1QMca reside 
in an informal 
dwelling. While most live in informal settlements, significant 
proportions have erected shacks in the backyard of another property, 
a distinctly South African phenomenon. Backyard dwellings have 
historically been overlooked by housing policies that focus on 
upgrading and eradicating informal settlements. Previously, backyard 
dwellers were perceived as marginalized, living in appalling 
conditions and exploited by cavalier landlords. 
¶4. (U) Several protests over housing have taken place in the area 
over the last few weeks as backyard dwellers are unhappy about the 
Amakhaya Ngoku housing development in the area.  Amakhaya Ngoku 
(meaning homes now) was formed in 2006 by local residents after a 
fire destroyed about 400 shacks, leaving more than 1 000 people 
homeless. After months of consultations and meetings residents 
agreed the shortage of land made free-standing houses impossible and 
settled for 352 sectional title apartments. The project will offer 
residents a rent-to-buy scheme that allows them to rent their homes 
for four years at R400 a month, after which they can buy and own 
them. The project, which was approved by the Department of Local 
Government and Housing has not been without controversy.  Ever since 
the development was proposed, various groups of residents have 
clashed over the plan and its proposed site, an area formerly 
suggested as school premises. Long-time residents of Masiphumelele 
support the Amakhaya project, but people who arrived later and 
erected shacks on theQrQQwith the MEC for Housing, Bonginkosi Madikizela. 
Amakhaya Ngoku is under immense pressure to start construction in 
order to fulfill the funding conditions of some of its international 
sponsors. Foreign donations are contributing more than R35-million 
to the project and failure to start building soon could put some of 
this money at risk, as well as increase building costs. PolAsst 
spoke with the media spokesperson for the MEC for Housing who 
declined to comment on the current situation in Masiphumelele.
