NIGHT VISION DEVICES FOR MOD 
 
REF: MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN IRAQI MOD AND 
     MNSTC-I ON COMPLIANCE PLAN FOR THE STORAGE 
     SECURITY AND INVENTORY OF NIGHT VISION 
     DEVICES - NOV 18 2005 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request, see paragraph 10. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: The Country Team requests the immediate 
release of U.S. military specification night vision devices 
(NVDs) to the Government of Iraq (GOI). Specifically, this 
request is for AN/PVS-5, AN/PVS-7 and AN/PVS-7D NVDs. These 
U.S military specification NVDs will be used by the Iraqi 
Ministry of Defense (MoD) to train and equip Iraqi Ground 
Forces to fight terrorism in urban and rural environments at 
night in total darkness.  This will advance nighttime 
operational effectiveness while reducing collateral damage 
risk.  This request is for the sale of 124 AN/PVS-5, 360 
AN/PVS-7 and 849 AN/PVS-7D NVDs valued at an estimated $6M US 
dollars. End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Description of Technology for Release 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) NVDs provide high quality image clarity essential 
for safe night time counter-terrorism operations. They allow 
the wearer to select and clearly identify the enemy and 
reduce the possibility of collateral damage. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Rationale for Technology Release 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Iraqi Ground Forces are in urgent need of viable 
night vision capabilities that will allow them to safely and 
effectively execute night counter-terrorism operations, 
particularly in conjunction with Coalition Forces.  Release 
of NVDs will greatly enhance their ability to conduct 
counter-terrorism missions, improve interoperability with 
Coalition forces, and improve their ability to maintain their 
own defense and security.  Fielding modern capable NVDs will 
also contribute to eventual Coalition advisory transition of 
Iraqi forces to independent operations. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Iraq Safeguarding Sensitive Technology 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Iraq has demonstrated the intent and ability to 
protect sensitive, classified military technology since 
working with U.S. and Coalition forces.  An Article 505 
agreement (signed by the GOI July 24, 2004) demonstrates 
Iraq's commitment to protect grant defense articles and 
technology similar to our standards.  Special notes in the 
signed Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) for NVD physical 
security and accountability define Iraqi responsibility for 
the controlled access and 100% physical count inventory for 
the safeguarding of NVDs purchased through Foreign Military 
Sales (FMS).  Upon request, inventory and accountability 
records maintained by the Iraqis will made available to U.S. 
personnel conducting Enhanced End Use Monitoring (EEUM) 
through the GOLDEN SENTRY program and Multi-National Security 
Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I) Security Assistance Office 
(SAO) Standard Operating Procedures.  Additionally, a 
Memorandum of Agreement Compliance Plan for the Storage, 
Security and Inventory of Night Vision Devices was signed by 
the Iraqi MOD on 18 November 2005.  We will also continue to 
mentor the Iraqi Forces on their accountability and control 
of NVDs in order to provide long-term cooperation with GOI. 
All the necessary documentation of U.S. to GOI transfer, 
receipt and inventory of NVDs will be obtained, reviewed and 
Qreceipt and inventory of NVDs will be obtained, reviewed and 
recorded for GOLDEN SENTRY EEUM purposes. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Anticipated Reaction from Neighboring Nations 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) We do not anticipate the release of NVDs to the 
Government of Iraq to adversely affect the regional balance 
of power or cause negative reactions from neighboring 
nations, as these system are already fielded in many 
countries of the region. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Iraq's Political Importance to the Region 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
BAGHDAD 00000040  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) A stable, democratically-elected Iraqi government, 
capable of protecting its people and sovereignty, and 
remaining at peace with its neighbors is one of the USG's 
highest priorities.  The release and employment NVDs will 
facilitate progress toward this goal, advancing the Iraqi 
security forces' ability to identify, target and carry out 
night operations against anti-Iraqi forces while reducing the 
risk to self and others. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Source of Financing and Economic Impact 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) This purchase will be financed by Government of Iraq 
funds.  The cost is estimated at $6M. There is no significant 
economic impact anticipated to be generated by this sale. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Relevant Human Rights Considerations 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶9. (SBU) There are no human rights considerations that should 
preclude the release of the defense equipment to the Iraqi 
Armed Forces. 
 
-------------- 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) We request immediate Washington approval for the 
release of U.S. military specification AN/PVS-5, AN/PVS-7 and 
AN/PVS-7 Night Vision Devices to the Government of Iraq, for 
use by the Ministry of Defense.
