Subdirector General for EU Trade Policy Nicolas Lopez and 
Subdirector General for Coordination and Bilateral EU 
Relations Javier Parra Rodriguez (both with the Ministry of 
Industry, Tourism, and Trade) confirmed to EconOff on 1/12/05 
that Spain intends to keep its Friendship, Commerce, and 
Navigation (FCN) treaty with the U.S.  Parra noted that the 
FCN treaty is substantively heavily weighted towards consular 
and navigation matters that are worth keeping in this 
bilateral instrument.
