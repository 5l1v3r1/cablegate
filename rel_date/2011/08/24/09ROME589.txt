¶2. (SBU) Italy has identified 500,000 euros to support the 
Ethiopian multi-role logistics unit in Darfur, according to 
MFA East Africa Office Director Giuseppe Pastorelli. 
Pastorelli contacted poloff May 20 with a final response to 
our April 24 demarche (refs A and B) requesting support for 
the Ethiopian unit to the United Nations-African Union 
Mission in Darfur (UNAMID).  Pastorelli said the MFA had 
decided to use resources allocated to the Italian Africa 
Peace Facility, a mechanism that Italy funds and directs 
jointly with the African Union (AU).  He hoped that the funds 
could be dispersed within a few weeks, once coordination with 
the AU was complete.  Pastorelli asked poloff to stress to 
the Department that the decision to commit these funds to 
UNAMID was made primarily due to the U.S. request.
