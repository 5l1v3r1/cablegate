SUBJECT: NEXT STEPS WITH S/CRS IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1. SUMMARY:  The Embassy and CJTF-82 jointly recommend that S/CRS, 
under Embassy direction, continue its Provincial Reconstruction Team 
(PRT) planning process to include the remaining U.S.-led PRTs.  The 
process should also be extended to the Brigade Combat Team level. 
This effort should be completed in time for use in the next PRT 
training cycle in January 2008.  S/CRS, in conjunction with FSI, AID 
and the military, should incorporate the planning process into 
pre-deployment training program for PR civil-military command teams. 
 Finally, Post and CJTF-82, in cooperation with Washington agencies 
should develop an enduring approach, the details of which should be 
finalized over the next 3 months.  End Summary 
 
¶2. PRTs are proven mechanisms for extending the reach of governance 
throughout Afghanistan.  Their success has been hampered, however, 
by the yearly rotations (soon to be shortened to nine months for the 
military) that require that each team learn its tasks, 
responsibilities, and operational context from scratch.  The process 
is further complicated by the need to integrate the civilian and 
military elements of a PRT command team.  In addition, the press of 
operational requirements makes it difficult for PRTs to devote the 
necessary time and resources to long-term planning.  As a result, 
individual actions are often not coordinated as effectively and 
efficiently as they could be in order to achieve a larger, strategic 
effect. 
 
¶3.  To address these issues, S/CRS drew on proven private sector 
strategic planning instruments, already used extensively by the 
military services and intelligence community, to design, test and 
validate an integrated planning process at two PRTs.  Their product 
was positively endorsed by the PRT civilian-military command teams 
and by the senior levels of CJTF-82. 
 
¶4.  Based on this evaluation, Embassy and CJTF-82 jointly recommend 
that: 
 
(A) S/CRS should send a team back to Afghanistan by September 20 to 
assist TF Bayonet and TF Cincinnatus in revising their plans and 
finish the four PRTs in their Area of Responsibility. 
 
(B) Form a second S/CRS team in October to accelerate the coverage 
of the remaining four USG PRTs in Regional Command (RC) East and the 
two USG PRTs in RC South. 
 
(C) Assist institutionalizing the PRT planning process through 
training civilians assigned to Embassy Kabul (POLAD, DA, FPO, etc.) 
and civil-military training institutions (FSI, Fort Bragg PRT 
Training, etc). 
 
(D) Develop an enduring approach, the details of which should be 
finalized over the next 3 months. 
 
¶5.  When in country, S/CRS will work under the direction of the 
Embassy PRT office, in close coordination with CJTF-82. Mr. Kemp, 
who serves as the PRT training coordinator, will accompany the team 
in its visits to PRTS, both observing and assisting in the process. 
To institutionalize the effort Mr. Kemp will also participate in 
pre-deployment exercises with the 101st Airborne Division at Fort 
Campbell, Kentucky, as well as in PRT training at Fort Bragg in 
January, 2008.
