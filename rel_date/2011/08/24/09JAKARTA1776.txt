SUBJECT:  INDONESIA EARTHQUAKE HUMANITARIAN UPDATE #12:  PROGRAM 
MONITORING REPORT 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  In response to the September 30 earthquake in West Sumatra, the 
USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) has programmed 
more than $5.2 million in humanitarian programs.  Current 
implementing partners include the American Red Cross, the Indonesian 
Red Cross (PMI), Mercy Corps, International Medical Corps (IMC), and 
the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). 
 These partners' programs are providing urgently-needed emergency 
relief supplies as well as health; protection; shelter and 
settlements; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and humanitarian 
coordination and information management assistance.  USAID's Office 
of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) will continue to 
monitor programs through at least mid-November.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
USAID/DART Program Monitoring Activities 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Since arriving in Padang following the September 30 earthquake, 
the USAID/DART has programmed more than $5.2 million in USAID/OFDA 
funding.  The USAID/DART is monitoring programs to ensure that 
earthquake-affected individuals receive urgently needed humanitarian 
interventions. 
 
------------------------------------- 
American Red Cross and PMI:Logistics, Relief Supplies 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  USAID/OFDA has provided nearly $900,000 in funding and 
commodities, including transport, to PMI and the American Red Cross, 
which is working in Indonesia through PMI.  With USAID/OFDA support, 
these organizations are providing relief commodities to affected 
populations. 
 
¶4.  Arriving via airlift on October 10, the emergency relief 
supplies from the USAID/OFDA warehouse in Dubai were consigned to 
PMI for distribution.  The U.S. Department of Defense transported a 
limited amount of these commodities for PMI via helicopter to 
affected areas.  The USAID/DART received reports that PMI began 
distribution, after a delay, on October 18.  (Comment:  The 
USAID/DART engaged in considerable follow-up with PMI regarding this 
delay.  End comment.)  At present, the American Red Cross is 
procuring pumps and small generators to attach to the Padang city 
water system in order to develop public hydrants, replacing the 
current tankering system that is supplying some city inhabitants 
with water in wake of the earthquake.  In addition, the American Red 
Cross is procuring 5,000 family kits, 1,000 baby kits, and 10,000 
sarongs for distribution to affected households. 
 
¶5.  On October 21, members of the USAID/DART conducted a site visit 
at Lima Kota Kampung Dalam village in Pariaman District.  PMI is 
transporting relief supplies to the village on trucks and, from the 
village, airlifting supplies to areas that are otherwise 
inaccessible due to road damage.  The USAID/DART observed a small 
stockpile of food from the U.N. World Food Program, USAID/OFDA 
commodities from the Dubai warehouse, and other emergency relief 
supplies.  During the site visit, one helicopter landed, was filled 
with commodities, flew to the affected area and delivered the 
commodities, and returned.  A PMI representative remarked that 
beneficiaries are "very, very happy" to receive the relief supplies. 
 PMI plans to access a total of four helicopters, provided by 
another donor, for 10 days to airlift the commodities. 
 
--------------------------- 
IMC:  Health and Protection 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6.  USAID/OFDA has provided $500,000 to IMC for programs targeting 
an affected area with a population of 387,000 people.  Through this 
 
JAKARTA 00001776  002 OF 003 
 
 
program, IMC is addressing the critical emergency health care and 
psychosocial needs of earthquake-affected populations while also 
supporting search and recovery efforts through local partner Ambulan 
¶118.  IMC is working closely with the Padang Pariaman District 
Health Department (DINKES) and the Provincial Coordinating Unit for 
the Management of Disaster (SATKORLAK) to ensure that all activities 
are coordinated.  IMC is following Indonesian Ministry of Health and 
U.N. World Health Organization guidelines for patient care.  Prior 
to beginning operations, IMC assessed conditions and consulted with 
local government officials, who chose the location in which IMC 
would work based on unmet medical needs. 
 
¶7.  On October 19, members of the USAID/DART accompanied IMC 
representatives to two community health centers and two mobile 
clinics.  Both mobile clinics and one of the two community health 
centers were crowded, with patients waiting in line to receive 
medical consultation.  The other community health center had no 
patients at the time of the USAID/DART visit, and IMC was unsure 
what caused the lack of patients in that facility.  Where local 
staff were present, the USAID/DART observed IMC and local staff 
working side by side.  IMC is working with local health systems, 
building local capacity while meeting needs. 
 
¶8.  IMC maintains an inventory of medication and pharmaceutical 
supplies in the community health center in Patamuan Subdistrict. 
IMC has an ample supply of a variety of medications, after having 
received donated medications and supplies from GlaxoSmithKline and 
Abbot immediately following the earthquake.  IMC is able to quickly 
purchase other medications or supplies as needed. 
 
¶9.  IMC publicizes the mobile clinic schedule so that individuals in 
need of care can receive medical attention.  At one mobile clinic, 
IMC is serving populations who have not seen a doctor in two years. 
At another mobile clinic, the earthquake damaged the only road into 
the village, precluding travel in and out of the village except on 
foot and small motorbike.  There, IMC is providing much-needed 
services to populations who otherwise would not be able to easily 
access health care.  IMC's community health centers and mobile 
clinics will serve as a type of medical "insurance" or disaster risk 
reduction measure against likely landslides and resulting injuries 
in earthquake-affected areas in the coming rainy season. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Mercy Corps:  Relief Supplies, Shelter, and WASH 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶10.  Shortly after the quake, USAID/OFDA awarded $300,000 to Mercy 
Corps for emergency relief supplies, shelter and settlements 
assistance, and WASH interventions.  In addition, USAID/OFDA 
provided $3 million to Mercy Corps to fund a consortium of 
non-governmental organizations implementing shelter and settlements 
interventions and providing emergency relief supplies. 
 
¶11.  On October 16, the USAID/DART team leader conducted a site 
visit at Jua village in Pariaman District to observe the 
distribution of hygiene and household kits and tool kits to 170 
targeted households -- one kit per family whose house was damaged. 
Mercy Corps selected the households in advance and provided numbered 
tokens to each household on the list of beneficiaries.  Prior to 
providing the household kits, Mercy Corps staff worked with village 
leaders to verify beneficiaries' names.  The distribution proceeded 
in an orderly manner, with community volunteers providing 
significant support.  Each hygiene and household kit included a 
20-liter plastic jerry can with a cap, a 10-liter bucket with a lid, 
bath soap, laundry soap, sanitary napkins, a water dipper for 
bathing, a family-size mosquito net, two sarongs, and a blanket. 
 
¶12.  Following the distributions of hygiene and household kits, 
families received tool kits.  Groups of five households, 
pre-selected due to proximity and kinship, each received one tool 
kit.  These kits included a wheelbarrow, two shovels, a rubble 
dustpan, two wood saws, one crow bar, one hack saw, one hammer, one 
 
JAKARTA 00001776  003 OF 003 
 
 
tarpaulin, and one kerosene lantern.  Mercy Corps chose the content 
of these kits based on similar kits distributed following the 
Yogyakarta earthquake in May 2006 that received positive feedback 
from beneficiaries.  Recipients expressed appreciation for the tool 
kits and stated that the kits would help them to clear sites and 
begin to reconstruct permanent shelter. 
 
¶13.  Beneficiaries expressed great appreciation for the assistance 
provided through Mercy Corps.  The USAID/DART did not observe ill 
will, complaints over assistance, or other negative reactions that 
may accompany commodity distributions.  The community of Jua is 
intact and strong, with significant community solidarity and social 
capital.  Shelter is the primary need in this community, and some 
households will likely require more assistance than others in 
reconstruction, based on limited resources, access to remittances, 
and the household labor profile.  Because members of the community 
tend to work together, the USAID/DART anticipates that extended 
family relationships will do much to help meet the needs of the more 
vulnerable members of the community. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
OCHA:Humanitarian Coordination,Information Management 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶14.  USAID/OFDA has provided $400,000 to OCHA to support 
humanitarian coordination and information management.  The 
USAID/DART has not monitored OCHA per se but has had significant 
interaction with OCHA and has worked within the organizational 
structure led by OCHA. 
 
¶15.  OCHA was slow to start but performed as well as could be 
expected in the early maelstrom of the humanitarian response to the 
earthquake.  The USAID/DART has observed good coordination in many 
clusters of the system that OCHA is coordinating.  OCHA has offered 
to host cluster meetings in locations closer to earthquake-affected 
areas, if participants are interested and if such meetings would be 
useful.  OCHA is compiling a database listing who is doing what 
where and has created a survey of surveys.  Moreover, OCHA recently 
finished compiling baseline data for earthquake-affected areas. 
OCHA is committed to being in Padang for three months, the duration 
of the Humanitarian Response Plan. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Continuation of Program Monitoring Efforts 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶16.  The USAID/DART will continue monitoring programs implemented 
with USAID/OFDA funding through October 25, when the USAID/DART is 
scheduled to depart Padang for Jakarta.  From October 25 through at 
least mid-November, USAID/OFDA field officers stationed in the 
USAID/OFDA field office in Padang will continue to meet with 
implementing partners, monitor programs, and assess humanitarian 
needs due to the September 30 earthquake.
