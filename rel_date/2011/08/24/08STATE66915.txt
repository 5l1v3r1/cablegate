SUBJECT: URGENT REQUEST FOR DEMARCHE ON JUNE 23 UNSC 
MEETING ON ZIMBABWE 
 
¶1. This is an action request.  See Paragraph 2. 
 
Objective 
--------- 
 
¶2. The UN Security Council will be discussing Zimbabwe June 
¶23.  Action addressees are requested to demarche host 
governments at an appropriately senior level, as soon as 
possible, to attain strong support for a Presidential 
Statement (PRST) being submitted by the UK and requiring the 
consensus of all UNSC members for adoption.  Action 
addressees should also seek national statements by host 
governments to echo the content of the Presidential 
Statement.  In the event consensus cannot be reached on a 
Presidential Statement, we may need to consider putting 
forward a resolution for adoption at the earliest possible 
time.  Support from all action addressees will be necessary 
to place Zimbabwe formally on the Council's agenda and to 
keep the June 23 meeting public.  Action addressees should 
remind host governments of the need to instruct their UN 
delegations prior to the meeting, which takes place June 23 
at 1500 EDT. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶3. With South Africa dropping its long-standing objections to 
a formal UNSC meeting on Zimbabwe, and other UNSC members 
following its lead, USUN scheduled a formal meeting on 
Zimbabwe for Monday June 23.  On June 22, Movement for 
Democratic Change (MDC) presidential candidate Morgan 
Tsvangirai issued a public statement saying he would not 
participate in the runoff election due to the violence that 
had taken place against the party and its supporters since 
the first round of voting on March 29.  The MDC's statement 
cited a number of reasons why a free and fair election is 
impossible, including: 
 
- state-sponsored violence and threats against MDC 
supporters; 
- the regime's preventing Tsvangirai from conducting an 
election campaign through unlawful arrests and prohibiting 
MDC rallies; 
- the partisanship of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission; 
- lack of access to the media; 
-  Mugabe's statements that an MDC victory would not be 
accepted; 
-  planned election rigging, and 
-  other factors that prevented a credible election. 
 
¶4. Tsvangirai's decision now shifts the focus of UNSC 
discussion and a potential outcome PRST to the impossibility 
of a free and fair election on June 27 and the impact of the 
situation on the wider region. 
 
Talking Points 
-------------- 
 
¶5. Posts may draw on the following points: 
 
-- The recent action by the Government of Zimbabwe (GOZ) in 
violently preventing lawful assembly and freedom of 
expression with stepped up violence targeting the opposition 
and its supporters have eliminated the political space 
necessary to conduct elections on June 27. 
 
-- There are disturbing press reports that election observers 
were assaulted during the ruling party's efforts to prevent a 
peaceful MDC party rally on June 22. 
 
-- The campaign of violence and the restrictions on the 
political opposition have made it impossible for a free and 
fair election to take place on June 27. 
 
-- As a result, the decision by the Movement for Democratic 
Change to withdraw from the election is understandable. 
 
-- The situation is having an impact on the wider region. 
 
STATE 00066915  002 OF 002 
 
 
-- UNSC members should join in consensus on the Presidential 
statement being put forward by Britain for discussion June 23. 
 
-- Action Addressee host governments should make national 
statements echoing the points in the PRST. 
 
-- The Security Council should remain seized of the Zimbabwe 
issue and a separate vote, requiring the support of all 
action addressee host governments, may be necessary to make 
Zimbabwe a UNSC agenda item. 
 
- We need all action addressee host governments' support.
