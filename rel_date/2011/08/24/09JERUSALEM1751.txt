SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (10/01): Israeli plan for a new 
settlement near Jericho raises further doubts about a peace 
agreement 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
News on the Israeli government's plan to build 14,000 settlement 
units to accommodate 40,000 settlers in Al-Walajeh village near 
Jericho receives lead coverage in the local press. Citing the 
Israeli daily Ma'ariv, this new settlement will be built on 3,000 
dunums of land confiscated from the Palestinians and will be 
presented to the Ministry of Interior for endorsement in the coming 
weeks. The reports note that this step is an obvious challenge to 
the US. In related news, the dailies report that the Israeli 
government issued tenders for the construction of 25 housing units 
in the settlement of Brakha, south of Nablus. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages news on the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization (PLO) Executive Committee meeting in Ramallah on 
September 30. The meeting condemned Israel's plan for a new 
settlement in Walajeh. In a statement issued by the committee, 
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas noted that 
Israel's endorsement of this new settlement will lead to the failure 
of all efforts to revive the peace process. Abbas asked the US to 
try to stop Israel from establishing this new settlement, according 
to coverage. 
 
The local press prominently reports on the agreement reached between 
Hamas and the Israeli government to release 20 female Palestinian 
prisoners from Israeli jails in exchange for a one minute video 
proving kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit is still alive. 
Reports note the deal was brokered through Egyptian mediation. The 
PA welcomed the deal. 
 
Al-Quds reports on the Palestinian faction Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) calling for a change to the Egyptian 
plan for national reconciliation. The DFLP stated that in order to 
end the state of division, there must be a unified election system 
that applies to the PLO and its national council, as well as the 
Palestinian Legislative Council in the West Bank and Gaza. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that in response to the request by French 
President Nicolas Sarkozy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
approved the reconstruction of Al-Quds hospital in Gaza by the 
French and Qatari governments. The hospital was damaged during the 
January 2009 conflict in Gaza.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title "The 
beginning of a shift in the world's public opinion (10/01): "In 
Britain we saw members of the Parliament demonstrating against the 
visit of Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak to London ... the same 
in Paris where we saw groups of French people carrying the 
Palestinian flag in support of the Goldstone report ... These 
actions may not change Israeli policies, but still these actions 
have weight and will help change public opinion, which can 
ultimately change the policies." 
 
2) Talal Okal opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title 
"The climate may change but things on the ground will remain the 
same" (10/01):"What we see from Hamas in terms of its positive 
attitudes towards the Egyptian proposal should make us feel better, 
but until now this hasn't changed public opinion ... the

Palestinians are not optimistic that the division will end, even 
with the Egyptian plan. We expect that the plan will be 
controversial and will not be easy to implement on the ground."
