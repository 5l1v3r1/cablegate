REF: SECSTATE 184111 
 
¶1. (U) This is Embassy Vatican's response to reftel 
concerning difficulties encoutered at U.S. ports of entry. 
The most egregious recent case that has come to our attention 
is that of Monsignor Philip Najim, a British citizen and the 
senior representative of the Chaldean Catholic Church to the 
Vatican (The Chaldean Catholic community, with ancient roots 
in Iraq and Syria, now has several churches in the U.S, 
particularly in Michigan and California.)  Monsignor Najim, a 
close Embassy contact who has met with the Ambassador on 
developments in Iraq relating to the Christian community, 
experienced severe problems and delay when he entered the 
U.S. at JFK airport approximately two weeks ago. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Monsignor Najim, (DPOB: 26 Sept 1959, Baghdad. UK 
Ppt # 7032235843) senior representative of the Chaldean 
Catholic Church to The Holy See, arrived at JFK on August 17. 
 He was requested to go to secondary, where he  was made to 
wait for over four hours, finally  fingerprinted, 
photographed and told he was subject to Special Registration 
procedures.  Meanwhile, Catholic officials waiting at JFK to 
pick him up had no idea what had become of him.  Najim is 
extremely upset about the incident, and how he was treated 
during the process.  Some of his colleagues have suggested 
approaching the media to publicize the incident as an example 
of "persecution of people of Iraqi descent," but Monsignor 
Najim has so far requested that they not publicize the 
incident.  He contacted Post from the U.S. soon after this 
incident to relay his concerns. 
 
¶3. (U) Post has contacted DHS representatives at Embassy Rome 
regarding Monsignor Najim's case.  The Chaldean Church has 
been generally supportive of U.S. actions in Iraq, and has 
been an important voice of moderation and religious 
understanding.  At a time when we are trying to build and 
maintain ties with leaders of the new Iraq, this incident has 
set back our relations with an important actor.
