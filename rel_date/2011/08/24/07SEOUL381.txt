REF: STATE 14071 
 
(SBU) On February 8, the DCM presented reftel points to 
Deputy Foreign Minister Shim Yoon-joe and conveyed the 
significance that the USG places on full implementation of 
UNSCR 1737.  The DCM noted that it was possible that U/S 
Burns might raise the issue during Shim's visit to Washington 
later this month.  Shim said that the ROKG would do what it 
could to prevent proliferation to Iran.  The Embassy will 
report additional responses when they become available.
