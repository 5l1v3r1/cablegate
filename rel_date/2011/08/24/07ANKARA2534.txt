In Today's Papers 
 
Edelman, Fried Pay Surprise Visit to Ankara 
All papers on Sunday and today cover the "surprise visit" of 
Assistant Secretary of State Dan Fried and Undersecretary of Defense 
Eric Edelman on Saturday "to express regret" over the approval of 
the Armenian genocide resolution and to "cool diplomatic tensions" 
sparked by the approval of the Armenian genocide resolution by the 
US House Foreign Affairs Committee.  Sunday papers report the US is 
concerned that the Turkish government might take extreme measures 
such as the closure of Incirlik Airbase. 
 
On the topic of a possible cross-border operation into Iraq by 
Turkey, Sunday papers report Fried and Edelman "warned" Ankara that 
a possible incursion would draw Iran into Iraq, "adding to turmoil 
in the region."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet writes Monday that 
Fried and Edelman were sent to Turkey to "calm the Turks" after the 
committee vote in favor of the resolution, but instead they 
"threatened" Turkey not to conduct a cross-border operation into 
northern Iraq.  Diplomatic sources said "the visit did not go as 
well as planned," reports Cumhuriyet. 
 
Papers report Edelman said following talks at the Turkish Foreign 
Ministry (MFA) the US considers Turkey a strategic partner and aims 
to maintain ties with Turkey.  Edelman said the administration was 
determined to oppose the bill in Congress. 
On the likelihood of a cross-border operation into north of Iraq, 
Edelman said Turks expressed concerns over recent terrorist 
developments in the southeastern city of Sirnak, adding the US 
shared those concerns.  Edelman said that in their next stop Baghdad 
they will convey Turkey's discomfort to the Iraqi authorities, 
underlining that Turkey's patience is about to run out. 
 
Military, Business and Armenian Communities React to Armenian 
Resolution 
All papers report on Sunday and today the chief of the Turkish 
General Staff (TGS) Yasar Buyukanit warned that ties between Turkey 
and the US would never be the same if the House passes the Armenian 
resolution.  Buyukanit said that by passing the resolution the US 
would be "shooting itself in the foot." 
 
Opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal said Turkey should close down 
Incirlik Airbase at least temporarily in reaction to the approval of 
the resolution by the US House Foreign Affairs Committee.  Sunday 
papers report State Minister Kursad Tuzmen has cancelled his trip to 
the US this week to participate in a meeting of the Turkish-American 
Business Council on "Turkey in 2008."  Papers also expect Prime 
Minister to review his plans for visiting the US soon. 
 
Meanwhile, the Patriarch of Turkish Armenians Mesrob Mutafyan said 
he opposed the resolution approved by the US House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, and promised to work against the adoption of the 
resolution by the House.  Mutafyan told the press that the 
resolution has become a tool of domestic policy in the United 
States. 
 
Editorial Commentary: Armenian Resolution 
Mehmet Yilmaz writes in the mainstream Hurriyet:  "Lately, there are 
heated discussions in Turkey concerning implementing sanctions 
against the US if the Armenian genocide resolution passes in 
Congress.  So far, more than 20 countries have approved such a 
resolution and Turkey's immediate reaction was to hastily impose 
sanctions against these countries.  Unfortunately, there is no 
evidence that those sanctions helped the situation or that we 
managed to implement them fully.  It is not difficult to understand 
what the Armenian Diaspora is trying to do; by 2015, which is the 
100th anniversary of the so-called Armenian genocide, they want all 
world parliaments to have issued such a resolution.  If we continue 
pursuing the policy of imposing sanctions, by 2015, we will be 
completely isolated.  However, the best way to counter these 
 
ANKARA 00002534  002 OF 003 
 
 
resolutions is to find a new method, like launching a comprehensive 
public relations campaign across the world.  The reason the Armenian 
allegations have become so widespread is that Armenians are good at 
public relations." 
 
Taha Akyol observes in the mainstream Milliyet:  "We Turks believe 
that Turks don't have any friends other than Turks themselves. 
Declaring the whole world an enemy and following this paranoia and 
challenging the world will not get Turkey anywhere.  While we are 
discussing our reaction to the US because of the Armenian resolution 
and also the CBO plans to counter PKK terrorism, we should not allow 
our emotions to affect us.  Instead of acting hastily and 
emotionally, let us make wise plans with well-calculated results." 
 
TGS Acknowledges Turkey Shelled Northern Iraq 
All papers report a statement posted by the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) on the Internet acknowledges for the first time that the 
Turkish military bombed PKK bases in northern Iraq on October 12, in 
retaliation for terrorist attacks coming from northern Iraq.  Papers 
over the weekend and today report extensively on the possibility of 
a cross-border operation by Turkey, with mainstream Milliyet saying 
military incursions into northern Iraq will include ground 
operations against the PKK camps in Haftanin, Sihant, Zap, Hakurk, 
Gara and Metina, and air strikes targeting the PKK camps in Kandil 
Mountains. 
Papers expect the ruling AKP MPs to give support to the motion 
despite the opposition of lawmakers from the mainly Kurdish 
southeast.  Saturday's papers report Erdogan as saying Turkey was 
ready to pay "any price" of an operation into northern Iraq. 
Erdogan underlined that PKK terrorists killed 30 soldiers during the 
holy month of Ramadan, and condemned the West for its reluctance to 
move against the terrorist organization.  Today the Council of 
Ministers is expected to approve a bill for operations against the 
PKK terrorists in northern Iraq, which will be sent to the 
parliament Tuesday to be discussed this week. 
 
Kaplan on Efforts against DTP, Northern Iraq Incursion 
All papers report the Kurdish DTP deputy Hasip Kaplan pointed to the 
efforts to strip DTP lawmakers of their parliamentary immunity, and 
threatened to launch huge civilian protests if his party is expelled 
from parliament.  Kaplan, during a visit to Habur border crossing 
with Iraq, called on the Turkish government to refrain from 
incursions into northern Iraq, and warned that operations across the 
border would lead to a war between nations.  Kaplan also sent a 
message to Kurdish MPs in the ruling AKP, urging them to resign from 
their party in case it acts in a hostile fashion against the Kurds. 
"You should not betray your people," Kaplan said.
