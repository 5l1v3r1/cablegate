1.(U) Summary. On December 4, the Australian Agency for 
International Development (AUSAID) announced an additional AUS $18.5 
million commitment (US $14.5 million) to combat AI in Indonesia, 
raising its total commitment to AUS $34 million (US $26.7 million). 
On December 14 in Tangerang, USDA launched the first in a series of 
epidemiological workshops.  USAID's Community-Based AI Control 
(CBAIC) project and its NGO partners recently conducted AI training 
sessions for sub-district facilitators in nine districts.   For the 
fifth consecutive week, NAMRU-2 reports no new detected or confirmed 
human cases of AI infection.  End Summary. 
 
AUSAID Commits to More AI Funding 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On December 4, AUSAID announced plans to provide an 
additional AUS $18.5 million over four years to the Government of 
Indonesia (GOI) for combating AI.  The funding will fund three new 
initiatives and allow AUSAID to expand existing programs, including 
support for the Ministry of Agriculture/Food and Agricultural 
Organization Participatory Disease Surveillance and Response Program 
(PDS/PDR).  The three new initiatives include: supporting the GOI's 
Strategic Plan at the National Level (policy and coordination); 
expanding capacity building and post graduate training, and; rolling 
out PDS/PDR programs and community awareness initiatives in South 
Sulewesi and Papua.  The additional assistance raises Australia's 
total contribution to AUS$ 34 million (US $26.7 million). 
 
USDA Sponsors Epidemilogy Workshops in Tangerang 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (U) USDA is sponsoring its first of a series of epidemiological 
workshops in Tangerang, Banten Province from 14-23 December. 
Workshop organizers designed the session for Indonesian field staff 
responsible for AI control at the provincial and district levels. 
Sponsored in collaboration with Indonesia's National Committee for 
AI Control and Pandemic Alert (KOMNAS) and other GOI and donor 
organizations, the workshop is targeting approximately 40 field 
staff in Tangerang, Banten, Jakarta and West Java provinces.  Table 
top exercises in the workshop are designed to promote sound 
analytical approaches to data collection, diagnostic capability, 
financial and human resources management, biosecurity, reporting, 
planning and public awareness.  It is the first of seven such 
workshops USDA is planning to sponsor in Indonesia.  The Ambassador 
attended the workshop's opening session and made brief remarks. 
 
USAID AI Training 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (U) USAID's Community-Based AI Control (CBAIC) project and its 
NGO partners recently conducted AI training sessions for 
sub-district facilitators in nine districts.  Immediately after this 
training, one of the sub-district facilitators found a possible case 
of AI in poultry and notified the local livestock department PDS/PDR 
team, which then confirmed the AI diagnosis.  Local press reported 
this event along with information on how to prevent the spread of AI 
and a phone number for suspected outbreaks. CBAIC is distributing 
3,500 booklets, 1,000 shop blinds and 500 flipcharts to support 
community mobilization and AI prevention activities. UNICEF will 
print an additional 100,000 copies of the USAID/CBAIC booklet for 
distribution in Java and South Sulawesi. 
 
NAMRU-2 Human AI Case Profile 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) NAMRU-2 reports no new human cases since November 12. 
NAMRU-2 data indicates the following AI-related case profile as of 
December 15: 
 
-- Number of laboratory confirmed (positive PCR and/or serology) 
human AI cases: 74, of which 57 have been fatal (case fatality rate 
of 77 percent). 
 
-- Number of probable AI cases 3 (2 deaths, 67%). 
 
-- Number of cases awaiting analysis at the U.S. CDC: 0. 
 
-- Number of possible untested AI cases under investigation (last 30 
days): approximately 4. 
 
Note: NAMRU-2 data corresponds with MOH data but may vary at times 
with AI case figures presented on the official World Health 
Organization (WHO) website, which usually lags NAMRU-2 data by one 
week.  The WHO website, last updated on November 29, notes 74 human 
AI cases in Indonesia with 57 deaths.  WHO figures can be accessed 
at www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza.
