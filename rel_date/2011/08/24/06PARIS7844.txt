CONVENTION 
 
REF: STATE 197786 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econ Counselor raised reftel points on the work of the OECD 
Working Group on Bribery (WGB) with MFA DAS-equivalent Cyrille 
Pierre on December 14.  Pierre said France was fully supportive of 
U.S. efforts to continue with a robust post-Phase II monitoring 
mechanism.  Parties to the Convention had yet to "arrive at the same 
place" on enforcement, and monitoring would be critical to progress. 
 Pierre said French business was particularly anxious to bring other 
parties along in order to ensure a level commercial playing field. 
 
¶2. (SBU) France was supportive of extending the WGB field of 
activity in some areas -- such as corruption in off-shore financial 
centers - as long as doing so would not sacrifice the focus on 
monitoring.  Increased outreach would also be important to encourage 
the trend of non-OECD members becoming party to the convention.  On 
the budget, Pierre said there was little daylight between the French 
and U.S. positions, particularly given that there was some 
fungibility among allocations.  Pierre closed by making a pitch for 
Guillaume Vanderheyden's candidacy for the WGB Management 
Committee, noting that he would bring strong legal skills to the 
job. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  From our vantage there has indeed been 
considerable evolution in the French attitude towards corruption.  A 
recent MEDEF (French employers organization)-sponsored conference on 
the topic saw much hand-wringing about the need for leveling the 
playing field now that France has enacted tough anti-corruption 
legislation.  The head of the Anti-Corruption Committee of the 
Council of French Investors in Africa, Philippe Montigny, told us 
recently that some of France's largest traditional investors in 
Africa have left the continent in recent years, in part because of 
growing concerns about the issue.  The GOF will be receptive to 
efforts to push the anti-corruption agenda -- both on demand and 
supply sides -- and we should seek every opportunity to do so.
