COMMITTEE 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  The GOI has sent Mission a diplomatic note 
requesting that the USG support Indonesia's candidacy for the 
UNESCO World Heritage Committee during upcoming meetings in 
Paris.  We urge that Department seriously consider 
Indonesia's candidacy.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GOI PRESSES CANDIDACY FOR KEY UNESCO COMMITTEE 
 
¶2.   (U) Indonesia's Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) 
has sent Mission a diplomatic note requesting that the United 
States support Indonesia's candidacy for the UNESCO World 
Heritage Committee.  The GOI notes that this issue will be 
reviewed during October 23-28 meetings in Paris.  (Note:  The 
dipnote is dated September 16, but Mission only received it 
on September 24.) 
 
INDONESIA DESERVES USG SUPPORT 
 
¶3.   (U) Mission recommends that the Department support 
Indonesia's bid for the World Heritage Committee.  Indonesia 
takes great pride in its rich and diverse cultural heritage 
and has a strong record of preserving that heritage.  For 
example, UNESCO recently added batik, one of Indonesia's most 
distinctive artistic products, to its Intangible Cultural 
Heritage list.  Moreover, Indonesia is a moderate 
Muslim-majority country with a tradition of respecting 
religious tolerance and diversity, working to protect 
heritage sites of all faiths and ethnicities.  Mission 
believes that Indonesia will bring a responsible and moderate 
voice to the Committee and help further U.S. objectives in 
UNESCO. 
 
GOI DIPNOTE 
 
¶4.  (U) The text of the GOI's diplomatic note follows: 
 
Begin text: 
 
The Department of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Indonesia presents its compliments to the Embassy of the 
United States of America and has the honor to inform the 
latter that the Government of Indonesia has decided to 
present its candidature to the World Heritage Committee at 
elections to be held during the 17th Session of the General 
Assembly of States Parties to the Convention Concerning the 
Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage 23-28 
October 2009 at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris. 
 
The Government of Indonesia is strongly committed to the 
protection and preservation of the world's cultural and 
natural heritage.  As member of the World Heritage Committee, 
Indonesia will work to ensure that effective and active 
measures are taken for the protection and conservation of the 
cultural and natural heritage.  Indonesia believes that its 
role in the World Heritage Committee will contribute 
significantly to the work of the Committee. 
 
In view of the above, the Government of Indonesia would like 
to request the support of the Government of the United States 
of America towards Indonesia's candidature in the World 
Heritage Committee. 
 
The Department of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Indonesia avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the
