REF: SECSTATE 16220 
 
¶1. (SBU) On February 26, Economic/Political Chief delivered 
reftel points to Hong Kong's Marine Department Director Roger 
Tupper.  Tupper stated no Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping 
Line (IRISL) or Hafiz Darya Shipping (HDS) vessels had 
entered Hong Kong waters in recent memory.  In the event such 
vessels tried to enter Hong Kong, Tupper explained Marine 
Department's policy was to admit all vessels (under Port of 
Refuge principle) but reserve the right to detain 
non-seaworthy vessels.  Such vessels would essentially be 
quarantined south of Hong Kong's Lamma Island away from port 
traffic.  According to Tupper, the Marine Department conducts 
Port State Control (PSC) inspections on all visiting non-Hong 
Kong registered ships for international maritime convention 
compliance, including for insufficient liability insurance 
coverage. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Director Tupper informed us that, although neither 
IRISL nor HDS operated in Hong Kong, at least two 
Iranian-based ship management companies had vessels 
registered in Hong Kong.  To retain their Hong Kong-flag 
status, however, these vessels had to comply with Hong Kong's 
Shipping Ordinances and UN Sanctions Regulations/Ordinances. 
(Note: Hong Kong has implemented UN Security Council 
Resolutions 1737, 1747, and 1803 on Iran, and 1718 and 1847 
on North Korea through local UN Sanctions 
Regulations/Ordinances. End Note).
