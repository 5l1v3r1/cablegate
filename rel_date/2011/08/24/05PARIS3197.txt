START MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
Because of his increasing influence within the Party, Frederic 
Bourcier will certainly be an important opinion maker in 
France in the coming years and is potentially a valuable 
future contact for the USG.   It is our hope that as a result 
of his participation in the IV program, Frederic Bourcier will 
be inclined to seek out U.S. views on International Affairs 
issues and support cooperation with the U.S. both privately 
and publicly.  As President of the French Network of City 
Education Policymakers, he could advocate a more balanced view 
of the United States at a time when its image is somewhat 
negative in the French media and institutions of learning at 
all levels. 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Mr. Bourcier should learn about American political 
institutions and should meet with elected officials so as to 
better understand the U.S. political system.  Additionally, he 
should meet with high-profile educators and education policy 
makers with whom he can exchange views on current trends in 
education, especially at the elementary level.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: Eric Beaty 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Mr. Frederic Bourcier has impressed me with his public 
speaking ability and his breadth of knowledge of international 
educational systems.  A youthful member of the French 
Socialist Party and chairman of the regional party structure, 
Bourcier has a bright future ahead of him.  He is also 
interested in American history, culture and education and does 
not proffer the usual worn clichs that shape many French 
politicians' opinions of the United States. When Rennes Mayor 
and fellow Socialist Edmond Herve (at the helm of the city 
since 1977) steps down in the next few years, he is likely to 
handpick Bourcier to succeed him. 
At 33 years of age, Bourcier already has the political 
expertise and connections that he will need to become a 
leading light in the French Socialist Party and perhaps a 
Minister in a future Socialist French government.  By his own 
admission, however, he does not possess an in-depth view of 
U.S. institutions, politics and culture.  An I.V. program at 
this early stage in his career will make him more receptive to 
American thinking or issues of mutual interest.
