¶1.  (SBU) An Egyptian official responsible for border 
security issues told poloff on April 27 that Egyptian 
security forces confronted two suspected Palestinian 
terrorists in a "heavily tunneled" area along the 
Egyptian-Gaza border at dawn on April 26 after Israeli 
liaison alerted them to a potential infiltration effort.  The 
official said one of the infiltrators escaped arrest and fled 
into Rafah town, where, as of April 29, he was still believed 
to be hiding.  The official said that GOE security forces 
found a suicide belt, which they believe the infiltrator 
dropped, in Rafah town. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to the official, the second infiltrator 
lost an arm and was seriously wounded after dropping 
"approximately 100" crude explosive devices when Egyptian 
security confronted him.  He remains hospitalized in the 
North Sinai town of Al Arish.  The official could not confirm 
that the two men entered Egypt via a tunnel, but said it 
appeared highly likely.
