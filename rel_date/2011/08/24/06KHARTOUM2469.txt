SUBJECT: ONGOING MILITARY ACTIVITY IN NORTH DARFUR 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) In briefings to the humanitarian community in El Fasher and 
in separate conversations with Active Response Corps (ARC) Officer, 
the UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) provided updates 
regarding ongoing military confrontations between the Sudanese Armed 
Forces (SAF) and the National Redemption Front (NRF) in North 
Darfur. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Most recently, on October 7, a significant clash occurred 
between SAF and NRF north of Furawiya, in the vicinity of the Boba 
internally displaced persons (IDP) concentration.  (Note: AMIS 
reported on October 8 that the attack took place "at Kariari, 45 
kilometers north of Bamina.   The report added that GOS troops have 
been dislodged from the village to Kornoi.  The attack was said to 
have occurred around 1500 hrs." End Note.)  UNDSS reported that the 
rebels attacked SAF positions, taking 350 soldiers prisoner and 
capturing 82 vehicles.  The NRF reportedly contacted UN officials to 
inform them of the clash and to request that they take charge of the 
prisoners.  (Comment: It appears that the SAF battalion attacked had 
only recently moved into the area in support of GNU efforts to seal 
the border from weapons and logistical support flowing from Chad to 
Sudanese rebels.  Unconfirmed reports also suggest the presence of 
Chadian forces among the NRF elements that initiated the attack. 
End Comment.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) On October 3, both UNDSS and AMIS reported SAF aerial 
bombardment of Malagat, which reportedly resulted in heavy NRF 
casualties.  Reports from field commanders and civilians in the area 
further indicated SAF looting of animals and property.  The October 
4 AMIS situation report states: "At 031815C Oct 06 a GOS Antonov 
Aircraft was observed circling Kutum area apparently in anticipation 
of NRF forces. At 031830C Oct 06, two GOS Mi 24 gunships were 
sighted in the air. One landed at Kutum Air Strip and several GOS 
Toyota Land cruiser gun jeeps were sighted moving north, but stopped 
at the Airstrip. They departed at about 031910C Oct 06. The MGS 
gathered that there were alleged cases of aerial bombardment by the 
GOS in the general area of Malagat, the MGS will further investigate 
and report accordingly."  UNDSS remarked October 8 that since the 
October 3 engagement in the vicinity of Malagat, there have been no 
further clashes, though both SAF and NRF are believed to have 
reinforced and repositioned their troops. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In briefing the humanitarian community, UNDSS also 
mentioned that it intends to investigate reports of land mines (NFI) 
north of Kutum.  The UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) - in conjunction 
with UNDSS - is likely to carry out its assessment on October 10. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The NRF's re-capture of Um Sidir from SAF in 
mid-September and its reported success against GNU forces north of 
Furawiya on October 7 indicate that the NRF remains a viable, if not 
widespread, fighting force.  It is possible that the most recent NRF 
attack was prompted by the rebels' objective to secure a clear 
supply line from Chad, disrupting SAF's attempts to interdict 
cross-border activity.  Some contacts have also speculated that, in 
anticipation of renewed attempts to facilitate dialogue between the 
GNU and Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA) non-signatories, the NRF is 
seeking to seize as much territory as possible to use for political 
and military leverage.  Since late August, the SAF has been 
augmenting its forces in North Darfur; though it is still too early 
to tell, the most recent NRF attack may be the trigger that 
unleashes a broader SAF offensive against rebels in North Darfur. 
End Comment.
