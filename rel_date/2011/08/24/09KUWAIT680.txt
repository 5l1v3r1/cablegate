     ¶B. 07 KUWAIT 585 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Ambassador discussed Kuwait Airways 
privatization, Kuwait-Iraq relations and Kuwait-U.S. ties 
during an introductory meeting with the new Minister of 
Communications, Dr. Mohammed Mohsen Al-Busairi, who also 
holds the title of Minister of State for National Assembly 
Affairs.  The Minister, an MP for the past decade, who hails 
from the Ajman tribe and was affiliated with the Islamic 
Constitutional Movement (ICM), expressed optimism that the 
current Cabinet would not meet the short-lived fate of its 
predecessors, asserting that with "a strong Government and a 
strong Parliament... we (Kuwaitis) can do something."  End 
Summary. 
 
Kuwait Airways Privatization 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Minister Al-Busairi confirmed recent press reports 
that the GOK intends to move forward with privatization of 
Kuwait Airways Corporation (KAC) (ref A).  He said that the 
Ministry of Finance is currently assessing valuations 
prepared by two external firms and that he expected KAC to be 
converted into a shareholding company within three months. 
He noted that legislation required the GOK to complete the 
process by the end of 2009 and that the GOK intends to stick 
to this timetable.  (Note: Many analysts were skeptical that 
the privatization of the long-suffering Kuwait Airways would 
be completed this year or next.  The GOK's assertion of 
intent to complete the process on time is perhaps indicative 
of a new confidence on the part of the executive branch.  End 
Note). 
 
Airport Expansion and Mega-Projects 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Busairi said the GOK expects to commence work on a 
major expansion of Kuwait International Airport (KIA) before 
the end of the year.  Noting that current annual traffic at 
KIA exceeds 7.5 million passengers (in a terminal designed 
for 5 million), he said that the three-year construction 
project would result in a facility capable of handling 20 
million passengers per annum.  He added that by 2025, Kuwait 
would need to consider an additional airport, possibly in the 
north close to the proposed Silk City and Boubyan Island 
"mega-projects" (ref B).  While Busairi revealed nothing 
about these mega-projects' commencement dates, he said that 
they were priorities for the influential Shaykh Nasser Sabah 
Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Minister of Amiri Diwan 
Affairs and eldest son of the Amir. 
 
Iraq-Kuwait Ties 
---------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Discussion of the above-mentioned mega-projects as a 
gateway to Mesopotamia and Central Asia led to an exchange on 
Kuwait-Iraq relations.  Busairi acknowledged the 
interconnectedness of Kuwait's and Iraq's economic 
development.  He stated that good relations between the two 
countries was in Kuwait's national interest and that both 
countries should look to the future, not the past.  He 
referenced post-World War II European integration as the 
optimal path for the two nations to follow. 
 
Kuwait-U.S. Bonds 
----------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Busairi was effusive about the bonds between Kuwait 
and the United States.  He noted that most Kuwaiti students 
dream of studying in the U.S.  With reference to U.S. 
military forces in Kuwait, he said that, "We still need you 
to be here," adding that this is the wish of "the Government, 
the people and even Parliament."  He said that the presence 
of U.S. troops in Kuwait and Iraq benefits Kuwaitis and 
Iraqis alike. 
 
 
Biographical Data
