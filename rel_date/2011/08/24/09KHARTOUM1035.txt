¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Elements of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), the 
Sudan Liberation Army/Minni Minnawi (SLA/MM) and Chadian armed 
opposition forces have  been positioned in the areas of Kutum, Abdel 
Shakur and Al Dur in North Darfur, according to UN sources. Sudan 
Liberation Army /Abdel Wahid (SLA/AW)  commanders claimed that on 
September 6, SAF and paramilitary forces attacked their positions in 
Korma, though UNAMID has yet to confirm the attack. Meanwhile in El 
Fasher, over a dozen IDP leaders detained following the murder of a 
pro-government umda in Abu Shouk camp were cleared and released on 
August 18, but have subsequently been re-arrested by National 
Security agents , according to IDP contacts. The detainees have not 
been mistreated, but are being kept in solitary confinement in Shala 
prison outside of El Fasher. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to sources at the UN Department of Safety and 
Security (UNDSS), on September 2 two SAF companies that  had been 
camping near Abu Shouk internally displaced persons (IDP)camp in El 
Fasher dismantled their equipment and moved in a convoy northward. 
The same sources  also confirmed that two SAF helicopter gunships 
and a combined military force of SAF, SLA/MM and Chadian armed 
opposition forces  had been positioned in the areas of Kutum, Abdelo 
Shakur and Ana Bagi in North Darfur. The objective of this troop 
movement is not known. 
 
¶3. (SBU) SLA/AW  commanders claimed that during the afternoon of 
September 6, GOS forces combined with Arab militia and elements from 
SLA/Free Will attacked their positions in Korma, North Darfur 
(approximately 70 kilometers northwest of El Fasher). The fighting 
is said to have lasted for about one hour. Three SLA/AW soldiers and 
two civilians were reportedly killed, and six or  seven SLA/AW 
soldiers wounded. On September 7 UNAMID had not yet confirmed the 
attack. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Speaking to emboff on September 2, members of the Fur Shura 
(elders' leadership) council in North Darfur stated that IDP leaders 
detained in the investigation following the murder of Omer Adam 
Ishaq (reftel) were cleared and released from police custody on 
August 19, only to be re-arrested that same day by the National 
Security and Intelligence Service (NISS). They are currently being 
held at Shala prison outside of El Fasher, as well as at NISS 
facilities.  . The detainees have not been mistreated, but are being 
kept in isolation without access to legal counsel. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Camp Umda Abul Basher Ali Ahmed told emboff that the 
majority of those arrested participated in a July 2009 meeting with 
UN DPKO Undersecretary General Alain Le Roy during his  visit to El 
Fasher.  Those attending  expressed  frustration to Le Roy over the 
activities of  government-backed Arab militias. Ahmed also stated 
that he believes that in the absence of camp leaders, the government 
intends to try and mobilize the IDP camps to support  National 
Congress Party (NCP) during the scheduled April 2010 national 
elections. 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: The positioning of GOS and paramilitary forces in 
North Darfur indicates that the government may be  consolidating and 
possibly expanding its areas of control. It is surprising, however, 
that such military actions would take place during Ramadan and at a 
time when there are converging events focused on a political 
settlement in Darfur.   Post will continue to monitor the situation 
closely and report any new developments.
