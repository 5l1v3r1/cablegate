Key Stories in the Media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha'aretz reported that U.S. general (ret.) James Jones said in his 
meetings on Tuesday with Israeli ministers that he will not serve as 
a "judge" and arbitrator of road map progress. According to the 
newspaper Jones noted that U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice 
wants him to draft a strategic plan for a stable security 
arrangement for the two state solution. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that the Housing Ministry has given the green 
light for a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem. The 
neighborhood, if built, would be the largest constructed in that 
part of the city since 1967. 
 
All media quoted Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as saying that Israel 
shall find all of those responsible for Qassam rocket firing. 
Yediot Ahahronot cited different officials from the IDF and the GSS 
praising each other for the successful IAF activity on Tuesday. 
Maariv reported that PM Olmert called what is happening in the south 
as war. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that the Prime Minister's office has established a 
task force dedicated only to preparations for President Bush's visit 
in January. 
 
Maariv reported, citing Palestinian sources, that the IDF has 
started using new anti-tank rockets that are much more accurate and 
advanced against missile launchers in the Gaza Strip. 
 
IDF Radio aired an interview Wednesday morning with Transportation 
Minister Shaul Mofaz, in which he said that Israel should not rule 
out indirect negotiations with Hamas in an effort to halt Qassam 
rocket fire at southern Israel 
 
 
Maariv reported that Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and her 
Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov have agreed to visa free travel 
between the two countries. 
 
Yediot reported that last week the GSS and the security 
establishment are establishing a committee of three to approve 
retroactively targeted killings of terror organization activists. 
 
Leading media quoted Attorney-General Menachem Mazuz as saying in 
his testimony to the Winograd Committee that the IDF acted within 
international law during the Second Lebanon War. 
 
Yediot reported that General Gadi Shamni, Head of the Central 
Command, is warning that stopping the work on the separation fence 
might lead to terror attacks. 
 
Kul Al Arab reveals an outline developed among extremist right 
leaders and few Kadima MKs to deport Muslims from the Galilee to the 
Naqab, while keeping the Christians and Druze, in order to implement 
the 'Jewish State' project as part of a future plan to exchange 
southern [Israeli] lands with the Palestinians. 
 
Both Kul Al Arab and Assennara reported that the Israeli government 
has finally recognized Bishop Theophilous as the Greek Orthodox 
Patriarch of Jerusalem after more than two years of opposition.

¶1. President Bush's Doctrine: 
----------------------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Columnist Michael Freund wrote in the conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post: "It is not that the Bush Doctrine is dead -- it most 
certainly isn't.  But the way things are going of late, it sure 
seems to be in need of resuscitation." 
 
Conservative contributor Menachem Ben wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv: "George Bush junior will be listed in history as 
one of the greatest presidents that America and the world has ever 
had."

¶I. "Introducing George W. Clinton" 
 
 
Columnist Michael Freund wrote in the conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post (19/12): "Will the real George W. please stand up? 
After seven years of fearlessly confronting evil, both rhetorically 
and militarily, the Bush administration seems to have faded away, 
replaced instead by a meek shadow of its former self.  Firm resolve 
has given way to disappointing frailty, as the shape and direction 
of US foreign policy increasingly resembles something taken straight 
out of Bill Clinton's playbook.  Across the board, on nearly every 
major issue of the day, from Iran to Syria to North Korea, the Bush 
administration is in retreat, abandoning the principled stands of 
yesteryear and replacing them with the unscrupulous and inexplicable 
policies now being pursued by the Department of State.... The result 
has effectively been a quiet coup, as George W. Clinton replaces 
Bush.  And that spells trouble, big trouble, in the War on Terror -- 
not only for Israel, but for America too.  It is not that the Bush 
Doctrine is dead -- it most certainly isn't.  But the way things are 
going of late, it sure seems to be in need of resuscitation." 
 
II. "The Greatest of Them All" 
 
Conservative contributor Menachem Ben wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv (19/12): "George Bush junior will be listed in 
history as one of the greatest presidents that America and the world 
has ever had... Bush is much more then can be seen, even if all he 
has is rare courage and common sense, both a rare commodity in our 
political days, in Israel and all over the world.... Israel does not 
have or ever had such a marvelous friend as George Bush Jr..... That 
is why we better try to achieve in his term a creative peace with 
all our enemies." 
 
-------- 
¶2. Gaza: 
-------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Senior military correspondent and analyst Alex Fishman wrote in the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Ahahronot: "You don't have to be 
a security cabinet member to realize that if the State of Israel 
wants to see President Bush here early next month -- this visit 
should not be accompanied by 200-300 Palestinians killed in an 
Israeli ground operation in the Gaza Strip." 
 
Economic editor Nehemia Shtrasler wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "There is a lot of talk here about the 
withdrawal from Gaza, but nobody mentions that Gaza is surrounded 
and starved.... It is clear that in a situation like this, hatred 
wins out and the desire to avenge is the only hope.  But here, all 
they are talking about is the suffering of Sderot."

¶I. "Measured and Calculated Actions" 
 
Senior military correspondent and analyst Alex Fishman wrote in the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Ahahronot (12/19): "You don't 
have to be a security cabinet member to realize that if the State of 
Israel wants to see President Bush here early next month -- this 
visit should not be accompanied by 200-300 Palestinians killed in an 
Israeli ground operation in the Gaza Strip.  Just as the army went 
into lower gear before the Annapolis conference, it will likely also 
let up on the gas pedal on the eve of Bush's visit...    But in the 
meantime, between the conference and the visit, the Israeli 
political echelon has to show, after all, that it is doing something 
to counter the continuous Kassam rocket fire.  So the military 
echelon is cautiously raising the bar against the terror from Gaza. 
In the meantime, no problems are being solved, rather the height of 
the flames is being played with.  This is playing with fire -- while 
trying to buy time.... Neither does the IDF want, at the present 
stage, an all-out clash.... And therefore, the targeted killings are 
also not a sign of things to come.  They are meant to buy time. 
That's why these actions are measured and calculated.  Nobody is yet 
attacking the political leadership of Hamas, nor even Islamic 
Jihad's political leaders.... In short: no step is being taken that 
could deteriorate the situation in Gaza at a timing inconvenient for 
Israel." 
 
II. "The Suffering in Gaza" 
 
Economic editor Nehemia Shtrasler wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (19/12): "There is a lot of talk here about 
the withdrawal from Gaza, but nobody mentions that Gaza is 
surrounded and starved. The situation there has been degenerating 
ever since the withdrawal.... Israel recently reduced the transfer 
of goods, including food, and the supply of fuel to the Gaza Strip. 
All this is leading to extreme shortage, tremendous despair and a 
feeling that there is nothing to lose.  It is clear that in a 
situation like this, hatred wins out and the desire to avenge is the 
only hope.  But here, all they are talking about is the suffering of 
Sderot."
