REFUGEES AND INTERNAL PALESTINIAN DIVIDES 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
With large, above-the-fold photos of the Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President, Mahmoud Abbas, and the Lebanese President, Michel 
Suleiman, the three dailies lead with news about Abbas' visit to 
Lebanon on August 28 and his meeting with Suleiman at the 
Presidential Palace in Lebanon.  During his visit, Abbas confirmed 
that he agrees with Lebanon's position of rejecting the permanent 
resettlement of Palestinians in Lebanon, stating that the 
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon have the right of return. 
 
The three dailies front-page a DBA report about Egypt's intention to 
send experts and security advisers to the Gaza Strip if the 
comprehensive Palestinian national dialogue succeeds.  According to 
the report, this Egyptian assistance will help to stabilize and 
normalize conditions throughout the Gaza Strip.  In related coverage 
in Al-Quds, Fatah confirmed in a report issued on August 28 its 
support for Egyptian efforts to bridge the gap between the 
Palestinian factions and reunite the Palestinian homeland. 
 
The three dailies report that Israel reopened the three commercial 
crossing points in the Gaza Strip on August 28: Sofa, Karni and 
Nahal Oz. This decision came in response to a request from Egypt 
that the crossings be re-opened before the start of the holy month 
of Ramadan. 
 
The three dailies highlight news about the departure of the two 
"Free Gaza" boats from the Gaza Strip on August 28.  According to 
these reports, the boats will take to Cyprus one Palestinian family 
(a mother and 4 children) who have Cypriot citizenship, as well as a 
child requiring medical treatment travelling with his father. 
 
Citing different agencies, all dailies report that eleven 
Palestinians were injured on August 28 during clashes with Israeli 
soldiers during a demonstration close to areas of land that Israel 
plans to confiscate in order to establish a "separation wall" in 
Ni'lin village, near Ramallah. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida covers news about an agreement signed between the 
Palestinian Authority and the German government on August 28. 
According to the agreement, the German government will donate $5 
million for the establishment of five police stations in the Jenin 
governorate. 
 
Citing Wafa, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that Hamas took over the 
Al-Nuseayrat municipality in the Gaza Strip on August 28, dismissed 
its [Fatah] mayor and village counselor, and appointed other Hamas 
members in their stead. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida cites an AFP report that the father of the 
Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who has been held captive by Hamas 
since 2006, accused the Israeli government in an August 28th 
interview on Israeli Radio of not making maximum efforts to release 
his son.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs an editorial entitled, "The Return and 
not the Permanent Resettlement" (8/29): "[T]he declarations of the 
[Palestinian Authority] President Mahmoud Abbas in Beirut 
confirm...that the Palestinian refugees object to the idea of 
permanent resettlement [in Lebanon]...and that their only goal is to 
 
JERUSALEM 00001621  002 OF 002 
 
 
return to their homeland, Palestine.  And, since their return cannot 
be achieved unless there is an intensive and continuous Arab and 
international effort, the Arab brothers must take on this role and 
make use of their high positions in the international arena to 
achieve their return...[P]utting pressure on the Palestinian 
refugees and making their lives hell is not the appropriate solution 
and will prevent their resettlement.  It can even increase 
complications and lead to more encounters and violence which 
threatens the internal Arab peace... " 
¶2.  Al-Ayyam runs an editorial by a regular columnist, Muhammad 
Yaghi, entitled, "This is not the time for Reconciliation" (8/29): 
"[I]t seems that there are enormous pressures on the Palestinian 
side to achieve a political agreement with Israel before the end of 
Bush's presidency. The American President, who discovered the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict too late, seems to insist on adding his 
touch on this conflict, and gave [the Palestinians] ideas such as 
making the reform of the Palestinian Authority a priority above the 
negotiation process.  And, he gave Israel promises and guarantees on 
the Palestinian rights' account.  Now, we...are worried about Rice's 
declarations that the issues are being discussed... regardless of 
the pressures, we trust that these pressures will not be heard by 
anyone.  The current Palestinian [internal] situation does not allow 
for any political agreement with Israel.  Even if [an agreement] 
happens, in view of this current division and conflict, it will not 
be the start of the end of occupation. On the contrary, it will set 
up a Palestinian-Palestinian conflict..."
