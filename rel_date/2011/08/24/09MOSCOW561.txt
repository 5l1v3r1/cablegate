REF: State 10843 
 
¶1.  (U) Subject of Proposal and General Information:  Embassy EST 
section greatly appreciates the opportunity to request a 2009 
science follow, ideally from either NIST or NSF, specializing in the 
field of nanotechnology who can work with the Russian government, 
Russian scientists and educators, and the Russian Corporation for 
Nanotechnologies (Rusnano) in advancing U.S. government priorities 
for bilateral cooperation.  We would prefer a three month 
fellowship, from approximately September 1 through December 1, 2009. 
 This would coincide with the second annual International 
Nanotechnology Forum scheduled for early October 2009 in Moscow, 
which will be attended by a U.S. delegation of experts and is 
expected to attract more than 3,000 scientists, investors and 
officials worldwide.  Secret level security clearance and medical 
clearance are required.  Russian language skills and experience 
working with Russian scientists and government officials are 
preferred, but not necessary. 
 
¶2.  Proposal Description:  The science fellow would work primarily 
with Rusnano and Russian scientists, diplomats, and educators to 
help advance the U.S.-Russian bilateral cooperation in the area of 
nanotechnology.  He/she would focus on promoting cooperation in the 
following six U.S. priority areas proposed for bilateral 
cooperation: 
-- (1) modeling and simulation of the properties of photonic and 
electronic materials at the nano-scale; 
-- (2) modeling and simulation of the properties of engineered 
nano-scale materials in a biological environment, including 
predictive toxicology; 
-- (3) self assembly of nano-structured materials and devices; -- 
(4) instrumentation and techniques for characterizing 
physicochemical properties of materials at the nano-scale, including 
biological materials; 
-- (5) instrumentation and methods for detecting and characterizing 
engineered nano-scale materials in the body or the environment, and 
protocols for evaluating their human health impacts and 
environmental effects; and 
-- (6) nano-materials for water purification and environmental 
remediation. 
The fellow would also facilitate greater Russian cooperation with 
the OECD Working Party on Nanotechnology on policy development, 
especially related to commercialization, and with the OECD's Working 
Party on Manufactured Nanomaterials on testing high priority 
nanotechnologies.  Russia has indicated it plans to get involved in 
testing.  As time permits, the science fellow will assist in 
promoting science cooperation as a whole, including public speaking. 
 
 
¶3.  Administrative Support: Post is committed to provide Embassy 
housing.  The actual unit will be determined by availability at the 
time of the Fellow's arrival.  It may be either on or off compound, 
and most probably will be either a one-bedroom or two-bedroom 
apartment.  Post will also provide office support and in-country 
travel arrangements. 
¶4.  RSO concurrence:  RSO has approved this request. 
¶5.  Contact information:  Embassy's primary point of contact is EST 
Counselor Deborah Klepp (off: 7-495-728-5339/5324, fax: 
7-495-728-5033).  Back-up point of contact is EST Assistant Patricia 
Kostelancik (off: 7-495-728-5000 x5616, fax: 7-495-728-5033).
