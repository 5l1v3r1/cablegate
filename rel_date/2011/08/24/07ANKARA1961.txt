REF: STATE 102149 
 
¶1. We raised reftel points with Bora Kerimoglu, Section Chief 
in the MFA Arms Control and Disarmament Department on July 
31, encouraging his office to ensure that the International 
Convention is on the agenda for the newly elected 
parliament's consideration this fall.  We also inquired about 
any legislation that the Turkish government has prepared to 
ensure effective implementation of the convention.  Kerimoglu 
promised to check the parliamentary agenda as well as the 
status of implementing legislation. 
 
¶2. Turkey passed legislation criminalizing and specifying 
jail terms for unauthorized possession, trafficking in, and 
use of nuclear materials as part of a 2005 reform of the 
Penal Code (Articles 172-174).
