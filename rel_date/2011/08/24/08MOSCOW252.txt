-------------------------- 
GAZPROM LEADERSHIP SHUFFLE 
-------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Gazprom is currently reshuffling its board of 
directors as a result of chairman Dmitri Medvedev's 
nomination as President Putin's successor.  The company's 
senior leadership was apparently sequestered January 30 in an 
extended board meeting to review nominees.  The current make 
up of the board: five members from the government, four from 
Gazprom, and two "independent" members, is not expected to 
change.  (N.B. Only one of the independent members, the 
chairman of Germany's E.On, seems to truly represent an 
entity outside the control of the GOR.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Medvedev's replacement as chairman has been the 
focus of intense speculation in the press.  Putin's economic 
advisor Arkaday Dvorkovich told Bloomberg news January 30 
that Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov had emerged as the choice 
for chairman.  This followed an article in the business daily 
Kommersant that Putin would take over the chairmanship. 
However, other press reports indicate Putin is not a 
candidate and the speculation is now firmly centered on 
Zubkov.  Although the list of board nominees is tightly held, 
nominees for the other government slots also reportedly 
include Economy Minister Nabiullina replacing former Minister 
German Gref, with most other members remaining the same.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Regardless of who becomes chairman, we don't expect 
any major changes in Gazprom's strategy or tactics. 
Gazprom's chairman is not traditionally involved in the 
day-to-day operations of the company.  The chairman is 
instead part of the country's senior political leadership and 
the big decisions on strategy and major deals will continue 
to be made by the Kremlin.  End comment.
