SUBJECT: DPRK NUCLEAR TEST: PROTEST SCHEDULED IN VLADIVOSTOK 
 
¶1.  Though the North Korean nuclear test took place less than 
180 miles from Vladivostok, reaction in the city has so far been 
fairly muted.  Professors at the Vladivostok State University of 
Economics and Service announced plans to conduct a small 
demonstration at noon on May 27 to protest the North Korean 
nuclear tests. 
 
¶2.  The Primorye Meteorological Service also announced a change 
in operations, increasing the frequency of radiation test 
readings from twice to eight times daily.  Monitoring stations 
in Vladivostok, Nakhodka, and a few other settlements will 
continue the increased monitoring until May 31. 
 
¶3.  The radiation level since the nuclear test has remained 
around 12 micro roentgens per hour, well below the maximum 
naturally-occurring level of 30 MR per hour.  The test 
registered as a 4.5 magnitude earthquake at a seismic 
observation station in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk according to local news 
reports, though no tremors were felt in the Vladivostok area. 
 
¶4.  All other government agencies are reporting business as 
usual.  A Primorye Kray Emergency Committee spokesperson 
responded to the media by saying "there is nothing for us to 
react to" and the Pacific Fleet press service reports that it 
has not called for increased combat readiness. 
 
¶5.  Comment:  There is a fair amount of goodwill for North Korea 
in the area due to the large number of North Koreans working in 
the forestry, fishing, and construction industries.  However, 
residents remember that debris from a previous rocket launched 
by North Korea fell in the Primorye district and there is 
certainly a limit to the feelings of neighborliness even here 
near the border.
