INDUSTRIES  TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE CIVIL SOCIETY COMMITTEE 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On January 29, the Ministry of Mines and Energy 
named the 26 members of the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative National Committee.  The group is 
government-heavy, and includes representatives from the Prime 
Minister's Office; the Ministries of Economy and Finance, 
Mines and Energy, Planning and Development, Interior, 
Justice, Environment, and Commerce; the Supreme Court, the 
national association of local governments, and the National 
Assembly (the Prime Minister's representative chairs the 
committee). 
 
¶2.  (U)  For the oil and gas industry there are 
representatives from CNR Energy (Canadian), Foxtrot Energy (a 
consortium of the French company Bouygues and the Ivoirian 
state oil company PETROCI), the Society of Mines and Ity and 
the Society for the Development of Mines of Cote d'Ivoire. 
Civil society has representatives from three labor unions, a 
national political humor weekly, the local branch of Publish 
What You Pay and the Coalition for Anti-Corruption and 
Transparency in Cote d'Ivoire. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Econoff met with Michel Yoboue the representative 
of the local Publish What You Pay branch.  Yoboue reported 
the National Committee has met twice, and has only begun to 
get organized.  It is concentrating on formulating a national 
plan of action (which is currently under review by the EITI 
staff in Oslo) and adopting a budget.  90 percent of the 
budget is paid by the government, and 10 percent by the World 
Bank.  Yoboue asked for USG and international assistance in 
requiring the petroleum industries, government agencies and 
other actors to provide copies of contracts, production 
figures and other documentation that would help in expanding 
transparency.  Yoboue also asked for USG assistance with 
training in public financing, contracts and auditing.  The 
Ivoirian branch of Publish What You Pay is actually a 
consortium of four separate groups, all of whom have links 
with known USG partners.  These partners include the World 
Bank, Revenue Watch, Global Witness, AfriCanada and local 
human rights groups MIDH, LIDHO and the Association of Women 
Jurists. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Comment.  The nomination of the national committee 
is yet another milestone in Cote d'Ivoire's adherence to the 
conditions to become members of the EITI.  Post notes the 
lack of any women on the board, as well as the 
government-heavy structure.  However, the ministerial mix 
includes those controlled by opposition parties and at least 
one NGO with the ability to engage substantively with the 
bigger, more sophisticated players on the Committee.  It is 
too early to judge how successful the Committee will be in 
achieving the EITI's stated objectives.  Embassy Abidjan will 
 
follow closely the operation of this organization and look 
for ways to engage with like-minded members of the Committee. 
 End Comment.
