SUBJECT: ROK WORKING ON ITS OWN STATEMENT TO SUPPORT 
INTERNATIONAL COMPACT WITH IRAQ 
 
REF: A. STATE 124125 
     Â¶B. SEOUL 2451 
 
On July 31 poloff delivered Ref A demarche to Kwak Sam-jin, 
Deputy Director of the Middle East Division at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT).  Kwak said the ROKG 
fully supported the International Compact with Iraq and would 
work on releasing its own statement supporting the compact. 
Kwak stated that Iraq Compact issues were currently being 
handled by two offices at MOFAT -- the International Economic 
Affairs Bureau and the Middle East Division (Ref B) -- thus 
an immediate statement could not be released until it was 
determined which division or bureau would take the lead. 
Kwak wondered if other nations, beside the U.S., UK, and 
Iraq, had released statements.
