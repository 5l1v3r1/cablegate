SUBJECT: TRIAL OF AMCIT JOURNALIST ANDREW MELDRUM 
OPENS ON JUNE 12 
 
¶1.   The trial of American citizen Andrew Meldrum, the 
   Zimbabwe correspondent for "The Guardian," begins on 
   June 12 at the Harare Magistrate's Court.  Meldrum was 
   charged with "publishing falsehoods," a violation of 
   the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy 
   Act (AIPPA) after reporting the now-disproved story of 
   a woman beheaded by ruling party supporters. 
 
¶2.   Meldrum's lawyer believes the case would be 
   dismissed quickly under normal circumstances.  We 
   know, however, that there is high-level Government of 
   Zimbabwe interest in the case that may make normal 
   court proceedings difficult. 
 
¶3.   Meldrum and two other journalists working for the 
   international media have filed a suit challenging the 
   constitutionality of sections of AIPPA.  If decided in 
   the applicants' favor, that case would render moot the 
   outcome of Meldrum's trial before the Harare 
   magistrate.  The High Court, however, decided that the 
   constitutional challenge to AIPPA was not urgent.  We 
   will report on further developments as necessary.
