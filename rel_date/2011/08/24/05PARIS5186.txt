REF: A. PARIS DIP NOTE 56 
     ¶B. STATE DEPARTMENT FILE NO. 2005-016 
 
¶1.  Embassy received research clearance for the subject 
vessel (reftel A) from the MFA under cover of diplomatic note 
number 1029/AME dated 21 July, 2005.  The note states that 
the French authorities have no objection to the research 
campaign of the R/V Ka'Imimoana in the French waters of the 
Marquesas Islands from 1 August to 30 November, 2005, on 
condition that the Captain and his crew follow current 
customs and transborder regulations.  The note further states 
that local authorities have been informed. 
 
¶2.  The note also states that the ship must inform French 
authorities of its entrance into and exit from the French 
Polynesian waters (info to be sent to: (mrccpapeete@mail.pf). 
 
¶3.  The note further indicates that the French authorities do 
not wish that "heavy seismic operations" be conducted during 
the research program.  The note also underscores the 
necessity for the research vessel, throughout its program, to 
pay specific attention not to harm fishing equipment left in 
place within French waters by professional fishermen.  This 
equipment (cages, nets, long-lines) is marked according to 
current regulations by round red buoys but can also be 
indicated by other various floating markers. 
 
¶4.  Finally, the MFA requests three/three copies of both the 
preliminary and post cruise report.
