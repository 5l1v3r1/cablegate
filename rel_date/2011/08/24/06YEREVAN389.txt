(SBU) On March 20, the executive director of the Armenian 
quasi-governmental "Research Center for the Problem of the 
Nonproliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction" (NPC) Karen 
Gasparyan, corrected inaccurate assertions (ref A) that the 
U.S. Department of Energy would fund the transfer of two 
radiological sources from Armenia to Russia.  Gasparyan told 
us the IAEA, and not the U.S. Department of Energy, would 
provide the funds to facilitate the transfer.  A series of 
commercial and government contracts involving the IAEA, 
Russian "Isotop," RusAtom, the Armenian quasi-governmental 
Radioactive Waste Storage Agency, and Armenia's NPC, paved 
the way to deliver the sources to Russia, Gasparyan said. 
Under terms of the contract, the parties had until "the end 
of 2006" to complete the transfer, according to Gasparyan. 
Gasparyan told us the NPC is still working to finalize 
import-export logistics "and other contract requirements," 
including obtaining shipping containers from Russia, before 
the NPC delivers the radiological materials to Isotop.
