¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 cases in Germany rose to 
111 on June 12, as sixteen more people were confirmed to be 
infected with the new virus.  More school children have 
contracted the virus. Despite the raise in the WHO pandemic 
alert level, there is no change in German measures.   END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On June 12, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its 
press briefing sixteen new laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 
in Germany. This increases the total number of confirmed cases 
in Germany to 111.  The new cases were distributed among the 
federal states as follows: North Rhine-Westphalia (9), Bavaria 
(1), Thuringia (1), Schleswig Holstein (1), Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(1), Hesse (1), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (1), and Saxony-Anhalt 
(1). 
 
 
More School Children 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Media reports that the number of children at a 
Japanese international school in Duesseldorf (North Rhine- 
Westphalia) who have tested positive for H1N1 has risen from 
27 to 46, in addition to three parents who are reportedly 
infected with the virus.  As reported in Ref A, the school has 
been temporarily closed to minimize the risk of further 
transmission to other children.  According to the media, the 
infected children are under quarantine at home. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  In response to WHO's raise of the global pandemic 
level, German health officials have voiced concerns about the 
general H1N1 situation, saying that it is serious and that 
people should consider certain preventive measures. However, 
they caution against panic, considering the low number of 
infections in the country compared to some European neighbors 
and countries like the US and Mexico. "We have expected WHO to 
raise the alert level", German Health Minister Ulla Schmidt 
said yesterday in Berlin.  "There is no need to take on 
additional measures. Measures implemented during the previous 
alert levels remain in place and will consequently be 
followed", the minister said.
