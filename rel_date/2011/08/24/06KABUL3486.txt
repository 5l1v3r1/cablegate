SUBJECT: GERMANS DISCUSS BORDER MANAGEMENT WITH 
IRANIANS 
 
¶1. (SBU) German Ambassador for Police Reform Helmut 
Frick told us that he and Deputy Head of the German 
Police Project Office (GPPO) Gerald Stoeter met on 
July 26 with Iranian Ambassador Mohammad R. Bahrami 
and Iranian Drugs Liaison Officer Hashem Zayyem, the 
Iranian Embassys expert on police issues, to discuss 
border management, and in particular a possible 
Iranian police contribution to provide security at the 
Zaranj, Nimroz Province, border crossing.  Ambassador 
Frick briefed the Iranians on the DOHA II concept of 
border management and the regional cooperation 
approach fundamental to BMI planning; the increase in 
Border Management Initiative (BMI) activity on the 
Western border with Iran; and the close cooperation 
between the GOA and the U.S. Embassys Afghan 
Reconstruction Group (ARG) on BMI, particularly at the 
Islam Qalah, Herat Province, border crossing. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bahrami responded by saying he did not wish 
to get involved deeply in police matters, but 
recommended that Frick and the GPPO meet separately 
with Zayyem to exchange information on activities on 
both sides of the border.  He raised the possibility 
y 
of a delegation from Teheran coming to Kabul if 
necessary.  Yet, he complained that Iran had offered 
several times to cooperate more intensively with 
Afghanistan in the field of police matters, especially 
training, but there had never been a substantial 
response from the Afghan side. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  We anticipate that under new Deputy 
Minister of Finance, Customs and Revenue Sharifullah 
Ibrahimi, the Iranian government will be invited by 
the GOA to participate in the BMI Working Group 
meetings.  Iranian representation could improve 
cooperation with a key neighbor, making BMI more 
effective in trying to achieve its goals of enhancing 
government revenues.  We would have to keep a watchful 
eye to make sure that such participation also served 
to enhance BMI goals with respect to border security, 
counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics and does not 
provide an entry for Iran into other police 
activities.
