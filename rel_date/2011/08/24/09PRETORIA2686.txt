(SBU) Reviewing reftel points and non-paper in a December 23 
meeting with Department of International Relations and 
Cooperation (DIRCO) Deputy Director for Nuclear Disarmament 
and Nonproliferation Johann Kellerman, DepPolCouns, noticing 
that the DIRCO building was emptying out for the holidays, 
apologized for the length of the message.  Kellerman 
protested and urged POLOFF to continue, adding that the U.S. 
had good reason to be proud of its role in promoting the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Pointing to a REFTEL 
non-paper point on a $190,000 2009 U.S. investment in an 
x-ray irradiator for a Tsetse Fly project in Burkina Faso, 
Kellerman said no other country invests in peaceful nuclear 
energy the way the U.S. does.  He added that South Africa 
very much appreciates U.S. efforts to promote the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy.
