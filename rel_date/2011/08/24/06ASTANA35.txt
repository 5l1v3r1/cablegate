REF:  STATE 169418 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Summary.  Charge delivered reftel points to Deputy Foreign 
Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov on October 10, taking the opportunity 
to thank Abdrakhmanov for the Government of Kazakhstan's (GOK) 
October 9 statement (paragraph 4) denouncing North Korea's 
announcement of a nuclear weapon test.   Abdrakhmanov termed the 
presumed test "inexcusable" and "clearly provocative."  "You can 
rely on us," Abdrakhmanov vowed, telling the Charge that the GOK was 
prepared to stand "shoulder-to-shoulder" with its international 
partners on this issue.  The GOK, he added, "would be ready to join 
further international actions," potentially including the 
implementation of Chapter VII UNSC sanctions, once it had "examined 
the situation thoroughly."   End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Responding to the Charge's thanks for the GOK's "strong 
and timely" statement denouncing the North Korean announcement, 
Abdrakhmanov commented that, "as a responsible member of the 
international community, Kazakhstan is striving to add its voice to 
the strong position of the world community in order to condemn such 
'provocative' actions."   The presumed test was "inexcusable," the 
Deputy Foreign Minister continued, and there existed no doubt that 
"we need to take decisive steps" to prevent similar future actions, 
not only on behalf of North Korea, but "other critical regimes." 
Abdrakhmanov told the Charge that, in his view, North Korea had 
timed its nuclear test "deliberately and provocatively" to coincide 
with the announcement  that South Korea's Foreign Minister is to 
become the next UN Secretary-General. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In response to the Charge's request for GOK support in 
adopting a Chapter VII UNSC resolution, Abdrakhmanov stated the GOK 
"would be ready" to join further international actions, potentially 
including the adoption of a Chapter VII UNSC resolution, once the 
GOK had "examined the situation thoroughly."   Regarding the 
possibility of implementing "other defensive measures," against 
North Korea, Abdrakhmanov told the Charge that the GOK had already 
begun to assess existing financial and commercial ties with North 
Korea, with an eye toward imposing "sanctions or other actions." 
While the issue of fairness toward any Kazakhstan companies doing 
business with North Korea would have to be considered, he continued, 
the GOK's steps would be "sustained and clear."  "We have no biases, 
no prejudices toward the North Korean regime," Abdrakhmanov 
concluded.  "We will go alongside the international community on 
this, shoulder-to-shoulder with our partners.  You can rely on us." 
 
 
¶4. (U)  Text of the October 9, 2006 statement of the Kazakhstani 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs follows (Embassy translation): 
 
"As a state that closed a nuclear test site and as a participant in 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test 
Ban Treaty and the Agreement on creation of a nuclear-free zone in 
Central Asia, the Republic of Kazakhstan considers the DPRK's 
decision to test a nuclear weapon a wrong one and denounces this act 
executed on October 9 of this year. 
 
We are confident that this step will aggravate the overall crisis in 
the sphere of non-proliferation and cause serious damage to global 
security. 
 
Kazakhstan urges North Korea to resume the talks on the nuclear 
problem in the six-country format with the participation of China, 
Russia, USA, South Korea, and Japan and to abandon nuclear 
ambitions."
