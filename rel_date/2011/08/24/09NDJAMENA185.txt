SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.    (SBU) The GOC confirmed publicly May 17 that it had 
made good last week on its long-standing pledge to exercise 
"right of hot pursuit" by pursuing fleeing Chad rebels back 
into Sudan and carrying out air strikes against them.  The 
GOC appears to have displayed some restraint in these 
operations, bringing its ground forces back home rapidly and 
limiting aerial strikes to rebel targets strictly defined. 
The GOC's public statement generally confirms reporting from 
many sources, including Ref A, of Chadian cross-border 
operations.  We hope but cannot be sure that this will reduce 
the rationale for Sudanese "retaliation" for Chad's 
cross-border operations as it removes the possibility of 
clashes between Chadian and Sudanese armed forces.  The GOC 
plans to conduct a domestic and international "public 
diplomacy offensive" to clarify its position and counter 
Sudanese   "propaganda."  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------- 
MILITARY OPERATIONS 
------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) Acting Defense Minister Adoum Younousmi announced 
during a May 17 press conference that Chadian forces, 
including ground and air forces, "had completely withdrawn" 
from Sudan as of the afternoon of May 17.  He said that the 
GOC had exercised its right of hot pursuit of the defeated 
rebels, with the result that Chadian air forces, supported by 
ground troops, had destroyed seven rebel pockets inside Sudan 
(Ref A).  Chadian National Army (ANT) ground forces 
penetrated up to 40 kilometers into Sudan, according to 
Younousmi and a subsequent statement posted on the Chadian 
Presidency website.  Younousmi also vowed that Chad would use 
its forces to prevent any reorganization of rebels, wherever 
they might try to regroup, with the intent of threatening 
Chad's security. 
¶3.  (SBU) Younousmi's May 17 remarks amplified May 15 remarks 
by Communication Minister and Government Spokesman Mahamat 
Hissene, who commented that he "would not be surprised by" 
reports of Chadian forces on Sudanese soil, since the ANT was 
continuing operations against rebels by chasing them out of 
Chad.  Hissene noted that Sudan's angry response was 
surprising, given Sudan's responsibility in the May 4-7 
attacks on Chad and history of supporting Chadian rebels. 
¶4.  (SBU) In Ref B last week, we reported that an ANT column 
entered Sudan May 13 near the Chadian town of Koukou Angarana 
and the Sudanese town of Babil in pursuit of Chad rebels, and 
that it had made some contact with rebels, but that there had 
been as of that time no fighting.  The rebels fled deeper 
into Sudan, while the ANT column apparently operated back and 
forth across the border over the next several days. 
---------------------- 
POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 
---------------------- 
¶5.  (SBU) Spokesman Hissene also announced the outcome of the 
May 14 Council of Ministers meeting, in which the Council met 
to review political and diplomatic responses to Sudan's 
"aggression," in the form of the rebel attacks.  Hissene said 
that Chad's options would soon be made public.  He said that 
he GOC planned to seek criminal charges against captured 
rebels and would equip Chadian military forces with the means 
necessary for fighting in the face of war.  As part of the 
meeting, the GOC decided to send an evaluation mission to the 
regions affected by the May 4-7 fighting to develop an 
assistance program for the local population and to restore 
peace and security, according to Hissene.  The spokesman 
added that the GOC would send missions to all regions of Chad 
to inform the population about its recent military actions, 
as well as to raise awareness of the upcoming general 
population census.  He noted that the GOC intended to send 
envoys to friendly countries to apprise them of Sudan's 
actions toward the Chadian people.

COMMENT

¶7.  (SBU) The GOC's public acknowledgment of its exercise of 
 
NDJAMENA 00000185  002 OF 002 
 
 
"right of hot pursuit" with respect to Chad rebels fleeing 
back into Sudan appears to have been accomplished with some 
restraint, as ground forces were brought back home rapidly 
and aerial strikes were limited to rebel targets strictly 
defined.  The GoC statement generally confirms reporting from 
many sources, including Ref A, of Chadian cross-border 
operations.  We hope but cannot be sure that this will reduce 
the rationale for Sudanese "retaliation" for Chad's 
cross-border operations as it removes the possibility of 
clashes between Chadian and Sudanese armed forces.  The GOC 
plans to conduct a domestic and international "public 
diplomacy offensive" to clarify its position and counter 
Sudanese "propaganda" strike us as useful.
