(SBU) Polcouns delivered reftel demarche to Sergio Sarda, 
chief of staff to Argentine MFA U/S for Multilateral Policy, 
June 3.  Sarda said the GOA was aware of a request for a 
special session of the UN Human Rights Council to take up the 
situation in Zimbabwe, which he said was deeply troubling. 
He said he was not aware of "an OAS offer to play a role in 
the June 27 runoff election by providing a robust 
election-monitoring delegation," but he took note of our 
points and offered to take them up with U/S for Multilateral 
policy Raul Ricardes.
