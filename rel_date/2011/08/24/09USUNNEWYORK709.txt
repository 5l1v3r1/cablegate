SUBJECT: SOMALIA: MONITORING GROUP PROPOSES 11 TARGETS FOR 
SANCTIONS DESIGNATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Somalia Sanctions Committee ("751 
Committee") has received a list (see para 4) of eleven 
possible targets for the first round of targeted sanctions 
under resolution 1844.  This list, which includes three 
Eritreans, was prepared by the UN Somalia sanctions 
Monitoring Group (MG).  The MG will present these names to 
the Committee in an oral briefing on July 21.  The Committee 
will not take any formal action until a UN Member State 
proposes that names be designated.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Somalia Sanctions Committee ("751 Committee") 
has received a list of eleven possible targets (see para 4) 
for the first round of targeted sanctions under resolution 
¶1844.  (NOTE: The Security Council in November 2008 imposed a 
new targeted sanctions regime -- asset freeze, travel ban, 
ban on arms transfers -- on Somalia.  The Somalia Sanctions 
Committee has not yet designated any individuals or entities 
under 1844.  END NOTE.)  The Somalia sanctions Monitoring 
Group (MG), the UN team mandated to monitor and report on 
compliance with the Somalia arms embargo and resolution 1844, 
identified these targets as having met one or more of the 
resolution 1844's designating criteria: 1) undermine 
stability in Somalia, 2) impeding humanitarian assistance 
and/or 3) having violated the arms embargo.  The MG-prepared 
list includes two armed groups and nine individuals.   Three 
of the individuals are Eritrean; an additional two 
individuals have already been designated under the Al-Qaida 
and Taliban Sanctions Committee ("1267 Committee") for their 
association with al-Qaeda. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The MG will brief the Committee about these names at 
a meeting on July 21.  The Committee will not make a decision 
on new designations until a UN Member State formally proposes 
that these, or any other names, be designated.  This listing 
request must be accompanied by a detailed statement of case 
in support of the proposed listing that forms the basis or 
justification of the listing.  All members of the Committee 
must agree unanimously to the listing.
