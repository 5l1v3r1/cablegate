¶1.  (U) Neither the GOE nor the Arab League have have issued 
formal statements regarding UNSCR 1636.  However, in a 
wide-ranging interview November 4 with Al Ahram newspaper, 
President Mubarak stressed the importance of maintaining 
Syrian stability.  He also noted that he had discussed with 
Syrian President Asad means of "continuing cooperation" with 
the Mehlis investigation and expressed confidence that Asad's 
"wisdom" would lead to resolution of the situation.  Mubarak 
also said he would not object to an Arab summit on the Syria 
situation should one be called. 
 
¶2.  (U) Al Gumhouriyya newspaper published November 3 
comments by Arab League Secretary General Amre Moussa. 
Post's informal translation of the brief Gumhouriyya article 
follows: 
 
Begin text: 
Arab League Secretary General Amre Moussa asserted that the 
Arab League's vision of UNSCR 1636 on Syria was based on the 
fact that the resolution was issued in accordance with 
Chapter Seven of the U.N. Charter and, therefore, should be 
dealt with completely.  Moussa pointed to Syrian Foreign 
Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa's remarks at the Security Council, 
namely that Damascus would cooperate with the investigating 
commission to the utmost.  Meanwhile, unidentified Arab 
diplomatic sources in Beirut stressed that Syria was exerting 
efforts to try to prove to the international community its 
good faith and behavior towards the international 
investigating commission.
