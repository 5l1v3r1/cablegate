(U) P/E Chief delivered reftel points on the President's 
announcement concerning potential sanctions against Sudan to 
MFA State Counselor for Multilateral Affairs Svetlana Geleva 
on April 26.  Geleva said the GOM hopes the Government of 
Sudan (GOS) will take action to fulfill its political and 
humanitarian commitments in Darfur.  If the GOS does not 
fulfill those commitments within a short period of time, the 
GOM will fully support U.S. efforts to impose new UNSC 
sanctions against Sudan.
