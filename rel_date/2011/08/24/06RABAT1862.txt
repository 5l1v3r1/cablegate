¶2.  (SBU)  On September 29, a clutch of European diplomats 
informed Poloffs that two European Union (EU) 
parliamentarians (MEP's) planned to visit the Western Sahara 
the following week, having previously visited Tindouf in 
Algeria, site of Polisario camps and Administration.  They 
acknowledged that the MEP's were known to favor Polisario 
positions on the Western Sahara issue.  The press reported on 
October 5, however, that five EU parliamentarians had been 
denied permission to visit the territory.  Abdelwahad Radi, 
the Moroccan speaker of the parliament, sent a letter to the 
EU speaker saying that the trip, planned for earlier in the 
week, had to be postponed because the visit was not 
practical.  A new wali (governor) had only recently been 
appointed and the parliamentarians could not be properly 
received.  The five EU parliamentarians, all of whom are 
Spanish, three of them late additions, were also identified 
in the press as being pro-Polisario.   No new date was 
announced. (Comment: The governor was indeed only getting to 
the territory at the time of the prospective visit, but it 
appears the Moroccans also put off the visit for political 
reasons. End Comment.)
