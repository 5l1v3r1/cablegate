SUBJECT: WOMEN'S RIGHTS MARCHERS ARRESTED, ASSAULTED 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Police in Bulawayo brutally suppressed a 
demonstration of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) on Wednesday, 
November 29 as the women's rights group launched their 
"People's Charter," a demand for social justice and 
affordable basic services.  According to WOZA, more than 70 
women were arrested; many suffered injuries, including 
several babies and an elderly woman.  Police ultimately 
detained 40 WOZA members at the central police station; they 
were scheduled to appear in court on Friday.  Access to 
lawyers and medical attention has reportedly been restricted. 
Embassy recommends the Department issue a statement 
condemning the Zimbabwean government,s actions (see proposed 
text in paragraph 4).

A Peaceful Demonstration Turns into Mayhem 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) According to WOZA, the demonstration began with 200 
WOZA members in Bulawayo's city center.  They began to read 
aloud from the "People's Charter," a document that seeks to 
hold government officials accountable for providing access to 
affordable education, housing, medical services, and other 
basic needs.  Witnesses reported that a group of 30 police in 
riot gear moved into the crowd and began beating people at 
random.  A stampede to escape ensued, during which three 
babies were reported to have been injured (one suffering a 
broken leg) and an elderly woman received a severe compound 
fracture of her ankle. 
 
¶3. (U) Police reportedly took 51 demonstrators to a nearby 
police camp where they were beaten and then released. 
Another 40 WOZA members, including six babies, have been held 
for two days at the central police station where access to 
legal assistance and medical attention was restricted.  Those 
arrested were to appear before a magistrate in Bulawayo on 
Friday on charges under the Criminal Law Act of disturbing 
the peace and participating in a public gathering with the 
intention of causing public disorder.

Proposed Statement 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Embassy recommends that Washington issue a statement 
condemning GOZ actions in suppressing the demonstration. 
Proposed text follows: 
 
On November 29, Zimbabwean police used violence to breakup a 
peaceful demonstration of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) and 
to arrest more than 40 WOZA members.  The United States 
condemns the Zimbabwean government,s brutal reaction to this 
peaceful effort of Zimbabwean citizens to exercise their 
rights.  We call for the immediate release of those still 
detained, for access to legal assistance, and for access to 
medical treatment for those who were injured.
