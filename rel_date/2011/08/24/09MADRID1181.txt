Post delivered reftel demarche on the EU draft Code of 
Conduct for Outer Space Activities to the MFA's Deputy 
Director General for Nonproliferation and Disarmament Gonzalo 
de Salazar Serantes.  De Salazar appreciated the U.S. input 
and particularly its timeliness.  He said that support from 
both the U.S. and Russia is important and added that feedback 
from Russia has been much less constructive.  Russia has 
crossed out entire sections of the draft and has been pushing 
for a legally-binding international convention rather than a 
voluntary code of conduct.  The EU plans to begin revising 
the document in January, taking into consideration the input 
received thus far, and will invite comments on the new draft 
in March or April.
