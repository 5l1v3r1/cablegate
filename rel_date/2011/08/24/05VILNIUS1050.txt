We delivered reftel points on the NATO-PfP Trust Fund 
munitions and small arms and light weapons disposal project 
in Ukraine to Lina Sucilaite, of the MFA's Ukraine and 
Moldova Division, and Ramunas Davidonis, of the MFA's NATO 
Division, on September 29.  Both agreed on the importance of 
the project within the context of Ukraine's deepening 
relationship with NATO.  Sucilaite confirmed that the GOL 
will contact the Government of Ukraine to support our call 
for finalization of the implementing agreement.
