ICRC Maintains Embassy Initiative Momentum 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  Capitalizing on the positive atmospherics of the June 1 
Tripartite Commission's Technical Subcommittee meeting (ref 
A), ICRC assembled a panel of forensics experts for a June 7 
"brainstorming session" on ways to accelerate the search for 
the missing -- on both sides of the border -- from the 
1990-91 Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait, following on 
an earlier Embassy initiative (ref B). 
 
Though Finding Remains is not an Exact Science,... 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2.  Discussions during the meeting focused on techniques to 
locate the missing and on technologies available to 
facilitate such searches.  Participants also reviewed some of 
the advantages and disadvantages of using equipment such as 
ground penetrating radar, metal detectors and probes to help 
locate bodies.  Participants collectively agreed that 
detailed eyewitness accounts -- as opposed to investment into 
expensive equipment -- would most likely lead to successful 
exhumations.  Of key value to the meeting was the experience 
and expertise offered by USAF Major Laura Regan (forensic 
anthropologist from the US Armed Forces Medical Examiner 
System) who stressed the importance of preliminary 
investigations prior to exhumation attempts.  She suggested 
that such investigations should include research through 
archives on the military unit to which the victims -- or the 
assailants -- belonged. 
 
...Identifying Them Must Be. 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  The meeting also examined how DNA matching led to the 
identification thus far of some 236 Kuwaitis recovered from 
mass grave sites in Iraq.  Forensics experts from Iraq and 
Kuwait shared notes on their respective scientific 
capabilities, and the GOK Ministry of Interior (MOI) 
expressed a willingness to provide training for Iraqi 
scientists.  GOK scientists then conducted a tour for all 
participants of the MOI's General Department of Criminal 
Evidence. 
 
Participants 
------------ 
 
¶4.  Along with the meeting's host, ICRC Kuwait's deputy 
regional delegate Mr. Moayed Golabi, and ICRC Baghdad's 
forensics specialist, in attendance were representatives from 
the Iraqi Ministry of Health's Medical Legal Institute Dr. 
Munjed al-Dezali and Dr. Falah Hassan Allami.  Also 
participating was a team of forensics experts from the 
Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior, as well as a forensics 
pathologist from the US Armed Forces Medical Examiner System, 
and representatives from the US Embassy's Naval Criminal 
Investigative Service, Defense Attache office and Political 
section.  The French and UK Embassies also sent 
representatives.  In total, 19 officials participated in the 
meeting. 
 
¶5.  We understand from Embassy Baghdad that the GOI has now 
extended an invitation for Kuwait to send a technical team to 
Iraq for this purpose.  We will follow up accordingly.
