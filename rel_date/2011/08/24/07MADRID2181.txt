REF: SECSTATE 159330 
 
 Post delivered Reftel 159330 points to GoS avian influenza 
contacts in the Ministry of Health and Consumption and the 
Ministry of Agriculture. Fisheries and Food.  The GoS is 
planning to send a delegation to the International 
Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza (IPAPI), but our 
contacts did not provide a list of attendees.  With respect 
to the question of foreign assistance, Spain has donated 1.05 
million dollars to the U.N. Food and Agricultural 
Organization's three-year Global Program for the Progressive 
Control of Avian Influenza since its inception.  Along with 
all other EU Member States, Spain has a national pandemic 
plan consistent with EU and World Health Organization 
guidance, according to the European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control.
