SUBJECT: TURKEY: SUPREME MILITARY COUNCIL RESULTS 
 
¶1. (U)  Turkey's Supreme Military Council (YAS) announced on 
August 4 the results of its annual meeting to determine new 
assignments, promotions, and dismissals.  As expected, 
Turkish Land Forces Commander (TLFC) GEN Ilker Basbug (bio 
info reported septel) was named the new chief of the Turkish 
General Staff (TGS), succeeding CHOD Yasar Buyukanit, who is 
retiring.  Although the CHOD's term is typically four years, 
Basbug, like his predecessor, is expected to only serve two 
years before retiring in 2010 when he reaches the mandatory 
retirement age of 67.  Second Army Commander GEN Hasan Igsiz 
(pronounced E-siz) was named Deputy CHOD, replacing GEN Ergin 
Saygun.  Saygun was named First Army Commander, succeeding 
GEN Ismail Kocman, who is retiring.  Jandarma Commander GEN 
Isik Kosaner has been named the Turkish Land Forces Commander 
(TLFC), putting him in position to become the CHOD in 2010. 
TLFC Chief of Staff GEN Atilla Isik was named the new 
Jandarma Commander.  Aegean Army Commander GEN Necdet Ozel 
was named Second Army Commander.  11th Corps (Turkish Forces 
in northern Cyprus) Commander Hayri Kivrikoglu was promoted 
to 4-star and named Aegean Army Commander.  Newly-promoted 
GEN Aslan Guner (4th Corps Commander) was named TLFC Chief of 
Staff.  Assignments other than the CHOD are two-year terms 
which are set to begin on August 30, coinciding with Victory 
Day celebrations.  Turkish Air Force Commander (TAFC) GEN 
Aydogan Babaoglu and Turkish Naval Forces Commander (TNFC) 
ADM Muzaffer Metin Atac both have one year remaining in their 
assignment. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Unlike any of the sessions in recent memory, the YAS 
did not announce any expulsion of officers.  Media 
speculation that the YAS would dismiss some active duty 
officers for involvement in press leaks, illegal acts or 
"reactionary activities" (being overly involved in religious 
activities) proved unfounded. 
 
¶3. (U) The following is a summary of the Turkish military's 
key line up beginning August 30:
