In Today's Papers 
 
Hrant Dink Assassination Trial Starts 
All papers report a court in Istanbul decided during the first 
hearing on the case to release four of the 18 suspects accused of 
participating in the assassination of Hrant Dink, an Armenian 
Turkish journalist.  The prosecutor asked for life imprisonment for 
the main suspects Erhan Tuncel and Yasin Hayal on charges of 
inciting the murder, and demanded a prison sentence between 18-24 
years for the assailant Ogun Samast.  Prison terms ranging between 
7.5 and 35 years were requested for other suspects.  The trial was 
held behind closed doors because Samast is a minor.  The trial date 
was set for October 1. 
 
Some 1,000 people gathered in front of the courtroom yesterday, 
shouting "We are all Hrant Dink; we are all Armenians" and "We want 
justice."  "Go to hell, you're all Armenians," shouted Fuat Turgut, 
one of the lawyers of the defendants, to the crowd. 
Dink's widow Rakel submitted a petition to the court urging those 
responsible for the murder be brought to justice.  Rakel Dink 
criticized the court's reluctance to deepen the investigation over 
fears that links between the members of the judiciary and the murder 
would be disclosed.  Dink's lawyers have expressed concerns about 
the possible involvement of Turkey's so-called "deep state" in court 
proceedings. 
 
DP Unveils Election Manifesto 
Hurriyet, Sabah, Radikal, Zaman and others report the leader of 
Democrat Party (DP) Mehmet Agar, disclosing his party's election 
manifesto, which called for students to be allowed to wear the 
headscarf at universities; and an "expanded EU forum" with the 
participation of political parties, universities and NGOs to change 
to the method of "open-ended talks" between the EU and Turkey. The 
DP manifesto also called for a cooperation mechanism between Turkey 
and Iraq which would secure Iraq's territorial integrity, adding if 
it fails, Turkey will withdraw from the 1926 Ankara Agreement which 
had marked the border between the two countries.  Resolution of the 
problems stemming from unemployment, social security, and unbalanced 
wealth distribution will also help bring terrorism to an end, 
declared the manifesto. 
 
US Military Attach Found Dead in Cyprus 
All papers report the Greek Cypriot police yesterday found the body 
of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Mooney, the defense attach at the US 
Embassy in Nicosia, who had been missing since June 28.  Papers 
speculate Mooney's death could be related to nuclear smuggling, or 
could be an Iranian act of retaliation for the "abduction" of 
Iranian Ali Reza Asgari in Istanbul earlier this year, or that he 
could have been poisoned.  Papers also note Mooney was a graduate of 
the Turkish military academy and was a military anti-terror 
specialist. 
 
Turks Seize Uzans' USD 250 Million in Switzerland 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and Yeni Safak 
report Swiss and Turkish officials have launched joint operations to 
track the assets of the Uzan family in Europe.  The officials have 
seized cash, gold and stock exchange certificates totaling USD 250 
million in Swiss banks.  State banking fund (TMSF) officials are now 
working to transfer the funds to Turkey.  The accounts had been 
frozen by an international court order on a telecommunications 
company controlled by the Uzan family.  The family is estimated to 
have at least USD 1 billion in Swiss banks. 
 
In 2004, Turkish financial authorities seized over 200 companies 
belonging to the Uzans for failing to repay debts of more than USD 
5.5 billion.  Arrest warrants have been issued for father Kemal 
Uzan, his brother Yavuz and Kemal's younger son Hakan, on charges of 
embezzlement, fraud and irregular off-shore transactions.  Another 
son of Kemal Uzan, Cem Uzan, is currently running for parliament in 
Turkey as the leader of the Genc (Youth) Party.

Editorial Commentary on International Peacekeepers for Gaza 
Erdal Safak observes in the mainstream Sabah:  "As if Turkey doesn't 
have enough troubles, now, there is an attempt to push it into hell 
in Palestine.  PLO Secretary General Yaser Abed Rabbo recently 
suggested that deployment of an international force in Gaza 
consisting of troops from countries such as Turkey, Indonesia and 
Qatar, could establish security there.  Sending Turkish troops to 
Gaza would be a nightmare for various reasons: an international 
force in Gaza would be interpreted among both the Turkish and Arab 
publics as defending Israel against Hamas; Hamas already announced 
they would consider such a force an occupation force and promised to 
greet them with missiles; there are more radical organizations in 
Gaza than Hamas, like the "Islamic Army;" Israel is against the 
international force having only observer -coordinator status; and, 
as a last reason, this international force will indirectly be 
involved with Iran because Hamas gets its weapons and financial 
support from Tehran.  Just one of these reasons alone is enough for 
Turkey to keep away from this hell.  If a peace force is sent to the 
region, then, Egypt should contribute troops as a neighbor of the 
Gaza strip.  If Egypt doesn't have sufficient troops, then the EU 
countries should contribute. However, they are hesitant to send 
troops to such a dangerous region, even though they support an 
international force there."
