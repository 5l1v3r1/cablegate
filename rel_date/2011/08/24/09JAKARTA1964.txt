SUBJECT: SUMATRA EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS CELEBRATE THANKSGIVING DAY 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY.  U.S. Consulate Medan hosted Thanksgiving Day dinner 
in Padang, West Sumatra, the province struck by a catastrophic 
earthquake on September 30.  ConGen Medan hosted 85 guests including 
senior government officials, U.S. alumni, high school students, 
Americans and ordinary citizens who acted heroically.  ConGen began 
the event by reading President Obama's Thanksgiving Day Proclamation 
and asking everyone to pray for the victims of the earthquake.  The 
Vice Governor thanked the U.S. for its care and support.  END 
SUMMARY. 
¶2. (U) ConGen Medan served up three boiled turkeys (no ovens were 
available) with all the trimmings to a group of 85 guests in Padang 
to celebrate Thanksgiving Day.  Padang was chosen for this year's 
commemoration in light of the September 30 earthquake which killed 
over 1,100 persons and left much of the province in shambles. 
Guests included senior civilian, police and military officials, 
university rectors, dozens of U.S. alumni, principals and students 
from two model public schools which were destroyed and the half 
dozen Americans living in Padang.  Several citizens who suffered 
great losses or performed heroic acts during the earthquake also 
attended. 
 
¶3.  (U) In his remarks, ConGen noted that the resilient spirit of 
the West Sumatran people in coming together in the face of adversity 
through their faith exemplified the spirit of Thanksgiving, as did 
the response by the U.S. and the international community in helping 
West Sumatra in its time of need. Vice Governor Marlis Rahman said 
he was moved by the U.S. concern and support.  He noted that 
Thanksgiving is similar to the Muslim holy day of Halal Bi Halal. 
 
¶4. (U) ConGen also recognized five persons at the dinner who faced 
great hardship or saved lives: 
-- The parents of Lani, a 12-year-old girl who lost both legs when a 
building fell on her and is recuperating at the wrecked hospital 
where the U.S. Navy set up its field hospital.  ConGen also visited 
Lani, giving her a Panda Bear. 
-- Zahra, a small girl trapped up to her neck in a landslide.  Her 
father responded to her calls, jumped in and pulled her out before 
the mud could bury her. 
-- Zulkifli, who ran into his home to rescue his young daughter, 
suffering head injuries. 
-- Junaedi, a fireman who rushed into a collapsed building saving 
many lives. 
-- Richard, a Padang city official who lost his daughter in the 
rubble. 
¶5. (U) The more than USD12 million the USG provided in emergency 
assistance to West Sumatra is widely appreciated, many seeing the 
U.S. as leading the world in helping West Sumatra.  The economy is 
beginning to recover with local markets bustling and farmers 
returning to the fields. 
 
¶6.  Nevertheless, West Sumatra faces a daunting challenge to rebuild 
tens of thousands of damaged homes and buildings, irrigation 
systems, and other infrastructure.  Padang and parts of the rest of 
the province remain in shambles.  The GOI is expected to announce a 
rehabilitation and reconstruction action plan costing an estimated 
USD700 million, with GOI funds not anticipated until March 2010. 
¶7.  The Padang Thanksgiving Day event received extensive local and 
national press coverage and was commented on in several blogs.  The 
U.S. Consulate Medan Facebook page's pictures of the event received 
numerous comments as well.
