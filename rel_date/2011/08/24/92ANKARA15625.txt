SUBJECT:  TURKEY:  1992 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 338430 
 
Â¶1.  PER REFTEL INSTRUCTIONS, THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION 
RESPONDS TO ITEMS (A) THROUGH (I). 
 
A)  THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT HAS NO PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN TRAIN AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER, 
THE GOT IS PROCEEDING WITH MULTIPLE PROSECUTIONS AGAINST 
DOMESTIC TERRORISTS AS OF NOVEMBER 1992.  THE TURKISH 
NATIONAL POLICE (TNP) MOUNTED SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL 
OPERATIONS AGAINST DOMESTIC TERRORISTS DURING 1992, MOST 
NOTABLY IN A SERIES OF "SAFE HOUSE" RAIDS IN ISTANBUL, 
ANKARA, ADANA AND IZMIR.  THE TNP TOOK INTO CUSTODY 
SCORES OF PERSONS SUSPECTED OF TERRORIST ACTS.  SOME OF 
THOSE APPREHENDED ARE BELIEVED TO BE AFFILIATED WITH 
DEV-SOL ("DEVRIMCI SOL" OR REVOLUTIONARY LEFT), 
INCLUDING ONE SUSPECT WHO IS CURRENTLY ON TRIAL IN IZMIR 
FOR COMPLICITY IN THE FEBRUARY 1991 ASSASSINATION 
ATTEMPT ON USAF LT. COL. ALVIN MACKE.  (THE PRIMARY 
SUSPECT IN THE MACKE ATTACK IS BELIEVED TO HAVE DIED IN 
1991 WHEN AN IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE HE WAS 
ATTEMPTING TO PLANT EXPLODED PREMATURELY.)  PERSONS 
SUSPECTED OF PARTICIPATING IN ATTEMPTED ROCKET ATTACKS 
AGAINST THE U.S. CONSULATE-GENERAL IN ISTANBUL FACE 
TRIAL AT THE STATE SECURITY COURT THERE.  OTHERS ARE ON 
TRIAL FOR TERRORIST ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN ON BEHALF OF 
THE OUTLAWED SEPARATIST KURDISTAN WORKERS' PARTY, THE 
PKK.  ALL PERSONS APPREHENDED BY THE TURKISH NATIONAL 
POLICE AND ARRAIGNED ON CHARGES RELATING TO TERRORIST 
ACTIVITY ARE KEPT IN DETENTION AS THEIR TRIALS PROCEED. 
 
B)  EMBASSY KNOWS OF NO EXTRADITIONS OR REQUESTED 
EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION TO 
DATE IN 1992.  IN NOVEMBER PRESS REPORTS SPECULATED THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY MIGHT REQUEST EXTRADITION OF 
PKK GUERRILLAS, INCLUDING THE PKK MILITARY HEAD OSMAN 
OCALAN, WHO REPORTEDLY HAVE COME INTO THE CUSTODY OF THE 
PESHMERGA FORCES IN NORTHERN IRAQ.  THERE HAS BEEN NO/NO 
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT ON THIS SUBJECT TO DATE. 
 
C)  TURKEY EXPERIENCES NO SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS.  THE ABILITY OF TURKISH SECURITY FORCES TO 
CAPTURE PERSONS SUSPECTED OF TERRORIST ACTS IS THE MAIN 
LIMITATION ON MORE PROSECUTIONS. 
 
D)  HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION 
HAVE INCLUDED FREQUENT AND VIGOROUS PUBLIC DENUNCIATIONS 
OF TERRORISM.  ANTI-TERROR RHETORIC PUNCTUATED THE 
PUBLIC DISCOURSE OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FROM THE PRIME 
MINISTER ON DOWN THROUGHOUT 1992.  THE SEMI-OFFICIAL 
ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY ALSO PROVIDED TRANSCRIPTS OF 
GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENTS VOWING TO CRUSH TERRORISM IN 
TURKEY.  THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY HAS COOPERATED WITH 
U.S. AND OTHER THIRD COUNTRY AUTHORITIES TO DETER 
TERRORIST THREATS. 
 
E)  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1992 BY 
THE HOST GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING STEPS TAKEN IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA, INCLUDE: 
--  ANTI-PKK OFFENSIVES BY MILITARY AND JANDARMA FORCES, 
WHICH HAVE OCCURRED WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY IN 1992. 
MOST OF THESE HAVE OCCURRED INSIDE TURKEY'S BORDERS, BUT 
THE MILITARY HAS CONDUCTED CROSS-BORDER OPERATIONS IN 
HOT PURSUIT OF PKK ATTACKERS INTO BOTH IRAQ AND IRAN. 
SINCE OCTOBER 5, A MAJOR OFFENSIVE BY TURKISH MILITARY 
FORCES (IN COOPERATION WITH PESHMERGA FORCES) HAS SOUGHT 
TO DRIVE THE PKK FROM ITS CAMPS IN NORTHERN IRAQ. 
--  TNP RAIDS (ESPECIALLY THOSE IN MAY AND AUGUST) 
AGAINST DEV-SOL SAFEHOUSES IN MAJOR URBAN CENTERS 
RESULTED IN THE CAPTURE OF SOME OF THE TERROR 
ORGANIZATION'S LEADERS ALONG WITH RANK-AND-FILE MEMBERS; 
THE SEIZURE OF WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, AND MATERIALS FOR 
MAKING BOMBS; AND THE ACQUISITION OF DOCUMENTS VALUABLE 
TO INTELLIGENCE AND COUNTER-TERROR OFFICERS. 
--  TURKISH GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS TO STRENGTHEN THE 
ANTI-TERROR POSITION OF THE CSCE, ALONG WITH CONTINUING 
TURKISH SUPPORT OF EXISTING INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS 
AND AGREEMENTS ON TERRORISM. 
 
F)  THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY DOES NOT SUPPORT 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM; TURKEY OPPOSES TERRORISM, 
DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL, AND MAKES ITS POSITION 
OUTSPOKENLY CLEAR AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY.  WHILE TURKEY 
DOES MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH IRAN, LIBYA, 
SYRIA, IRAQ AND THE PLO, WE WOULD NOT CHARACTERIZE 
TURKEY'S RELATIONS WITH THESE AS CONSTITUTING 
"DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT" FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
G)  TURKEY HAS MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A 
TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. 
 
H)  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1991 IN 
TURKEY'S ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, INTERNATIONAL OR 
DOMESTIC.  IF ANYTHING, THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT'S 
ANTI-TERRORIST STANCE HAS BECOME EVEN MORE OUTSPOKEN AND 
ADAMANT. 
 
I)  IN FORMAL TERMS, TURKEY CONSIDERS ITSELF "IN 
COMPLIANCE" WITH UNSCR 748:  TURKISH AIRLINES FLIGHTS TO 
LIBYA AND LIBYAN ARAB AIRLINES FLIGHTS TO TURKEY CEASED; 
TURKEY HAD NO EXISTING MILITARY SUPPLY AND TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE RELATIONSHIP WITH LIBYA; TURKEY BARRED LIBYAN 
ARAB AIRLINES PERSONNEL FROM ITS AIRPORTS AND LAA 
OFFICES CLOSED FOR LACK OF BUSINESS. 
TURKEY HAS NOT, HOWEVER, MADE A "SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION" 
IN DIPLOMATIC STAFFING.  TURKEY MAINTAINS ITS 3-4 PERSON 
EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI (CITING THE NEED TO SERVE THE 
THOUSANDS OF TURKISH CONTRACT EMPLOYEES WORKING IN 
LIBYA) AND REFUSES TO EXPEL ANY LIBYAN DIPLOMATS FROM 
THE EMBASSY IN ANKARA.  (THE DIPLOMATIC BOOK LISTS 11 
LIBYANS--INCLUDING TWO "FINANCIAL ATTACHES"--AS POSTED 
IN ANKARA.)
