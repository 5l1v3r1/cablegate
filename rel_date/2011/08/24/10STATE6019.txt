SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050199525 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050199525 for the export of 
International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled machine gun 
weapon system components to France.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern inquiry within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: No military foreign end-user is 
identified on the license for a commodity that appears to be 
intended for ultimate sale to a government military entity. 
 
¶4. ACTION: The Department requests that Post contact end-user 
Eurocopter France in order to confirm that it received the 
items listed and that they will be used for the purpose 
stated on the license.  In addition, Post is requested to 
inquire as to who will be the ultimate end-user of the 
CH-53GS helicopter on which the machine gun components will 
be installed.  Finally, Post is requested to remind 
Eurocopter France that Department of State authorization is 
required for the retransfer or re-export of the components. 
 
END ACTION.
