officials have vaccinated more than 21,000 birds with a 
total target of 160,000.  Since the recent outbreak, city 
officials are focusing more attention on the vaccination 
program.  Suhartoyo said his office needs additional 
equipment to effectively carry out bird vaccinations. 
 
MEETING WITH EAST JAVA PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) ConGen Surabaya discussed the recent outbreak of AI 
in Surabaya and the provincial poultry vaccination program 
with Suhadji, Deputy head of the East Java Provincial 
Livestock and Animal Husbandry Department and Bambang 
Hermawan, Head of the Animal Health Division of the 
Department on March 16.  Suhadji stated that his office 
assisted the City of Surabaya Livestock office in dealing 
with its AI outbreak last month, and confirmed that city 
officials followed the proper procedures as set out by the 
MOA.  Suhadji and Hermawan said there are no known human AI 
cases in East Java at this time, as recently stated by the 
Governor.  Suhadji added that provincial officials have 
detected the AI virus in bird populations in 2006 in four 
previously "clean" regencies (Situbondo, Bondowoso, 
Lumajang, and Surabaya).  He added that 29 of the total 38 
East Java regencies and cities are now or have been infected 
with AI. 
 
¶7.  (U) East Java province is administering a large 
vaccination program covering small holders of poultry, 
according to Hermawan.  Provincial officials have vaccinated 
4 million birds in the province so far, with a goal of 23 
million birds in all of the infected regencies.  They are 
not offering vaccinations to large commercial poultry 
operators because provincial officials assume they can 
afford vaccinations for their flocks.  Hermawan complained 
that the province has 1,000 personnel trained to administer 
the vaccines but they lack sufficient medicine and equipment 
to effectively carry out the program.  Hermawan also noted 
that his office has been preemptively spraying disinfectant 
in provincial areas populated with migratory birds, 
including Surabaya, Pasuruan, Sidoarjo and Gresik in an 
effort to delay the spread of the AI virus to domestic 
birds. 
 
AI IN CENTRAL JAVA 
------------------ 
 
¶8.  (U) On March 20, Suara Merdeka newspaper reported the 
death from AI of 1,650 chickens in Grobogan Regency, Central 
Java.  However, Dr. Rianto, Chief Veterinarian from the 
Animal Health Division of Grobogan Regency Livestock and 
Fisheries Office told Congen Surabaya officers on March 23 
that the article had misstated the facts.  Instead, Rianto 
said regency officials had destroyed 200 birds either 
infected with or dead from the AI virus in early 2006.  In 
addition, regency officials destroyed 1,450 birds infected 
or exposed to AI in two different villages during 2004 and 
400,000 dead or infected birds in 2003.  Rianto clarified 
that the large discrepancy between the numbers of birds 
destroyed between 2003 and subsequent years was due to a 
 
JAKARTA 00004467  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
massive reduction of the number of infected birds in the 
regency. 
 
¶9. (U) Rianto said the regency is not culling healthy birds 
in the vicinity of outbreaks, only properly disposing of 
dead birds or culling birds showing symptoms of AI virus 
infection.  Grobogan officials do not follow MOA directives 
to cull all birds within a 1-kilometer radius around an AI 
virus outbreak due to the ineffectiveness of the GOI's 
compensation program for farmers.  Rianto said there is a 
great deal of paperwork involved with making a compensation 
claim, and a MOA representative must come from Jakarta to 
verify and approve any compensation requests, a process that 
is slow and prone to corruption.  "Most local farmers only 
have a few chickens and do not object to our removing birds 
that are already dead or sick without compensation", noted 
Dr. Rianto. 
 
Human AI Case Profile 
--------------------- 
 
¶10. (U) NAMRU-2 has identified a new probable case, a 23- 
year old male from the Jakarta suburb of Bekasi.  Hong Kong 
Laboratories and U.S. Centers for Disease Control, (CDC), 
have confirmed H5N1 in two probable cases, a one-year old 
from Jakarta and a 5- year old from Bekasi.  The Ministry of 
Health (MOH) and NAMRU-2 have petitioned the World Health 
Organization (WHO) to include two older probable cases (an 8- 
year old female and a 45-year old male) as positive for 
H5N1.  Thus, these two victims are included in NAMRU-2's 
total, but are not listed as confirmed by the WHO. 
 
¶11. (SBU)  NAMRU-2 data indicates the following AI-related 
case profile as of April 4: 
 
-- Number of laboratory confirmed (positive PCR and/or 
serology) human AI cases: 33, of which 25 have been fatal 
(fatality rate of 76 percent). 
 
-- Number of probable AI cases: 4, with 2 deaths (fatality 
rate of 50 percent). 
 
-- Number of cases awaiting verification by the US CDC: 4. 
 
-- Number of possible AI cases under investigation: 
approximately 32. 
 
-- Number of excluded AI cases: 248.
