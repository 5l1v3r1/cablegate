SUBJECT: PREVIEW OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH ON AFGHANISTAN IN 
TIMOR-LESTE 
 
REF: A) STATE 122731 AND B) STATE 122234 
 
¶1.   Ambassador met on the evening of December 1 (local time) 
with Timor-Leste President Jose Ramos-Horta to share a preview 
of President Obama's West Point speech on Afghanistan (ref A). 
President Ramos-Horta thanked us for the early alert, said he 
intended to watch the speech live and pledged to issue a public 
statement in strong support of the increased U.S. commitment to 
Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Early on December 2 (local time), the 
ambassador called on Foreign Minister Zacharias da Costa.  After 
receiving our preview of President Obama's policy statement, FM 
Da Costa thanked the U.S. for its "critical" leadership and 
commitment to the security of Afghanistan and Pakistan, and 
stated the Timorese government will support the U.S. mission in 
Afghanistan "one hundred percent." 
 
 
 
¶2.  We will follow up with the Timorese president, as well as 
the prime and foreign ministers, once President Obama delivers 
his remarks.  Post will also ensure the West Point speech 
receives maximum local media coverage and report on local 
reactions promptly.
