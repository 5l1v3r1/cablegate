Show of Gratitude Results in Arrests

¶1.  (SBU) Between 500 and 600 members of Women of Zimbabwe 
Arise (WOZA) and Men of Zimbabwe Arise (MOZA), held a 
peaceful mid-day march on Wednesday May 29 in downtown 
Harare, which was broken up by police.  According to the WOZA 
communications officer, the march was to protest the current 
post-election violence in Zimbabwe, to call on the Southern 
African Development Community (SADC) to intervene, and to 
thank the Zambian government for their efforts to speak out 
within SADC.  The marchers intended to walk three blocks to 
the Zambian embassy along Kwame Nkrumah Avenue, a main street 
in Harare's business district.  WOZA said it notified the 
Zambian embassy of their march just minutes before they 
began.  The Zambian embassy has not communicated with WOZA 
since the march. 
 
¶2.  (U) Just before marchers arrived at the Zambian embassy, 
police arrived and arrested one man and thirteen women, 
including WOZA National Coordinator Jenni Williams, who 
received Secretary Rice's International Women of Courage 
Award for Africa in 2007.  The 14 were charged with "activity 
likely to cause public disorder."  Williams was charged with 
an additional account of "causing disaffection among the 
police and publishing false information."  On Friday May 30, 
all were granted bail, but the State appealed, leaving the 
WOZA members in jail until their second hearing on June 6.

¶3.  (SBU) This is the third march WOZA has coordinated since 
the March 29 election, including a Mother's Day protest on 
May 5 against post-election violence in which 11 WOZA and 
MOZA members were arrested and 59 were injured.  While WOZA 
is known for their frequent protests and arrests (over 70 
protests and 2,500 arrests since their founding in 2003, 
according to WOZA's press release), this detention appears 
abnormally long, and it appears that the Zimbabwean 
government is using its appeal powers to keep 
politically-motivated persons in jail for more extended 
periods of time as the June 27 presidential runoff draws 
closer.  END COMMENT.
