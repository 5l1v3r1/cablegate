SUBJECT: BAHRAINIS CONDEMN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Local media and Embassy contacts were angry 
at Israel, the U.S., and moderate Arab governments.  There 
were several orderly demonstrations, the largest drawing 
3,000 protesters.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Bahrainis reacted angrily but without violence to news 
from Gaza.  Contacts and local media focused on the allegedly 
disproportionate Israeli response to Hamas rockets, 
criticized the U.S. as unconditionally supportive of Israel, 
and complained that Arab governments (including by 
implication Bahrain's) were collaborating with the U.S. and 
Israel.  Several editorials claimed the U.S. had pressured 
moderate Arab governments to remain silent. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Like almost everything in Bahrain, reaction to Gaza 
reflects sectarian division.  The mainstream Shi'a opposition 
party, Al Wifaq, organized an orderly rally in support of 
Gaza Palestinians on December 29 which drew approximately 
3,000 marchers.  Participants chanted anti-Israel and 
anti-U.S. slogans.  Hizballah flags, and photographs of 
Hassan Nasrallah were openly displayed, and Israeli and U.S. 
flags were burned.  Simultaneously, the local Muslim 
Brotherhood party staged a competing demonstration across 
town.  That event drew several hundred participants and was 
also non-violent. 
 
¶4. (SBU) December 30 Emergency Action Committee meeting 
reported septel.
