SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) The National Reference Center for Influenza at the 
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced 263 new laboratory- 
confirmed cases of H1N1 in Germany in its July 22 press 
briefing.  This increases the total number of confirmed cases 
to 1,818.  New cases were distributed among fourteen federal 
states: Lower-Saxony (96), North Rhine-Westphalia (60), Baden- 
Wuerttemberg (34), Hesse (16), Rhineland-Palatinate (11), 
Berlin(9), Saarland (9), Thuringia (7), Saxony (7), Hamburg 
(4), Brandenburg (3), Schleswig-Holstein (3), Bremen (2), and 
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (2).  The majority of new infections 
occurred abroad, mainly during travel to Spain. 
 
¶3. (U) North Rhine-Westphalia remains the German state with 
the 
highest number of virus cases with a total of 603 followed by 
Lower-Saxony (422) and Baden-Wuerttemberg (220 cases).  Only 
30 percent (539) of all confirmed infections in Germany have 
resulted from domestic transmission. 
 
 
German companies prepare for an outbreak 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Media reports indicate that German companies are 
preparing for the pandemic and taking precautionary measures 
to protect employees against the virus.  Many companies, 
including car manufacturer Daimler and insurer Allianz, have 
increased their stockpiles of antiviral medication.  In 
addition, some companies such as steel giant Thyssen-Krupp 
reportedly established a crisis management task force. 
Precautionary measures also include distributing H1N1 
information brochures to employees and booking direct flights 
for business trips to avoid unnecessary stops at airports.
