SUBJECT: Post seals agreement with Djibouti Airlines to 
distribute HI! Magazine in flight 
 
¶1.   (U) SUMMARY: Post today made an agreement with Djibouti 
     Airlines to distribute HI! Magazine as free, in flight 
     reading material. The airline will receive 150 copies 
     monthly to offer to passengers. Negotiations with Daallo, 
     another local carrier, are still pending. END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.   (U) Post proposed providing a monthly shipment of Hi! 
     Magazine to Djibouti Airlines for distribution as an in- 
     flight periodical. Djibouti Airlines operates out of Dubai, 
     United Arab Emirates and is owned by Moussa Rayleh Waberi, a 
     Djiboutian businessman who also owns Telstat (in partnership 
     with Houssein Bogoreh Bouh and Abdallah Houmed Mohamed). The 
     airline flies to: Aden, Yemen; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; 
     Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Dire Dawa, Ethiopia; Hargesa, 
     Somalia; and Borama, Somalia. 
 
¶3.   (U) The majority of patrons of Djibouti Airlines are 
     business or religious travelers to the Middle East and 
     middle class Djiboutians, Ethiopians and northern Somalians 
     (Somalilanders) traveling for business or pleasure. 
 
¶4.   (SBU) Post hopes this agreement will increase 
     distribution of HI! to the limited number of Arabic speakers 
     in the Horn of Africa by reaching business travelers from 
     the Middle East, as well as middle class travelers in 
     Somalia and southern Ethiopia.  Increased distribution 
     furthers specific MPP goals including influencing public 
     opinion.
