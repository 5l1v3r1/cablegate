REF: STATE 93521 
 
¶1. (SBU) Per reftel request, we spoke with Mechanical and 
Chemical Industries Corporation (MKEK) procurement department 
July 16 and 17 in order to obtain a contact within the 
Turkish Ministry of Defense (MOD), the end user listed for 
license number 05-050047111.  MKEK representatives informed 
us that the firm had canceled the order for 5,000 kilograms 
of Aluminum Powder valued at 28,900 USD (MIL-DTL-512B, Grade 
F, Type III, Class 6). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The MKEK procurement department, whose 
representatives were courteous and willing to answer our 
questions, verified the details of the order, as well as the 
fact that "end user" and "non-transfer and use" certificates 
had been completed.  A company representative explained that 
they had expected the order to arrive from foreign 
intermediate consignee Trus International, but that this 
second firm had taken too much time in delivering the powder. 
 
¶3. (SBU) MKEK is an independent company that operates under 
the guidance of the Turkish MOD.  Because of extensive delays 
on the part of Trus International, and because of MKEK's need 
to fulfill a contract with the MOD, MKEK canceled the order, 
and has since engaged an Indian firm.  MKEK representatives 
also noted that the chemical composition of the powder in the 
original order was found to be inappropriate. 
 
¶4. (SBU) As the foreign consignee canceled the order in 
question, we did not carry out the pre-license end use check 
for this Blue Lantern request.
