SUBJECT: IRAN SANCTIONS ACT (ISA, FORMERLY ILSA): 
DELIVERING STRONG USG MESSAGE ABOUT AGREEMENT BY SINOPEC 
ON YADAVARAN PROJECT 
 
REF: STATE 165844 
 
(SBU) Reftel instructed Embassy Beijing to raise US concerns 
about the reported agreement by the Chinese firm Sinopec to 
develop the Yadavaran oilfield in Iran.  Info addressees on 
that message included some posts where issues relating to 
investment in Iran have also arisen.  Relevant posts may, at 
their discretion, advise host-country officials that we are 
deeply concerned about the Yadavaran deal and are raising 
those concerns in Beijing, and that the USG continues 
strongly to oppose investment in Iran,s oil and gas sector, 
which can undermine efforts to pressure Iran to comply with 
UNSC resolutions and raise issues under the Iran Sanctions 
Act (ISA).
