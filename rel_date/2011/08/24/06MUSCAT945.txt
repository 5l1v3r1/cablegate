¶1. (SBU) Foreign Ministry Disarmament Affairs officer 
Abdullah al-Riyami confirmed to Pol/Econ chief June 11 that 
Oman has received the official Polish invitation to attend 
the June 23 Proliferation Security Initiative High-Level 
Political Meeting (refs A-C), including information regarding 
on-line registration.  The invitation was delivered via 
Poland's embassy in Riyadh.  Al-Riyami said he will confirm 
as soon as possible Omani attendance.  Unlike the recent PSI 
exercise Anatolian Sun held in Turkey (ref D), which four 
Omani military officers attended as observers, al-Riyami 
noted that the Poland event was political and therefore would 
require attendance, if any, by Foreign Ministry rather than 
military personnel.  P/E chief noted the Foreign Minister's 
positive indications regarding Omani attendance at the Warsaw 
event, and encouraged al-Riyami to inform him as soon as 
Oman's attendees are confirmed. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Oman's attendance at the Turkish PSI 
exercise in May marked the first time Oman has taken part in 
a multinational PSI event outside the Sultanate.  We 
anticipate some level of Omani participation in Warsaw on 
June 23 as well, giving further impetus to Omani engagement 
on PSI.
