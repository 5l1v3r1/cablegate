Summary 
 
¶2.  (U)  Karbala Governor Aqeel warmly welcomed and accompanied 
DUSD Paul Brinkley and his delegation, Karbala native and GOI 
spokesman Ali al-Dubbagh, and PRT leader to Karbala on November 
15 and accompanied the group on its five hour visit to Karbala. 
After a warm reception at the Governorate compound, the 
delegation proceeded to tour the greenbelt, a seven by fourteen 
kilometer project on the desert side of Karbala where thousands 
of eucalyptus trees have been planted.  Karbala  Agricultural DG 
Al-Her noted that the project, which needed 53 wells, and one 
thousand workers, was sixty percent completed.  The DG described 
the challenges that agriculture faces in Karbala, including lack 
of cold storage, the need for a polythene plant so the farmers 
could build covered growing houses, and the lack of agricultural 
tariffs, which meant that cheap agricultural imports from Iran 
made it impossible for farmers to grow many crops profitably. 
Al Her noted that Karbala was rich in date production, and over 
100,000 people depend on date farming for a living.  However, 
production only covers fifteen percent of demand so there was 
little product left over to develop an export business.  He 
added that there was there were now no pesticide spray 
facilities, that seed tissue culture was was below 
California/Gulf levels, and that the water available for 
agriculture in Karbala had a high salt content.  U.S. date 
yields from comparable fields were three-and-a-half times 
Karbala yields. 
 
¶3.  (U) DUSD offered the Karbala Agricultural DG a USD one 
million grant of polythene wrap that he will be able to 
distribute to Karbala farmers, which should enable farmers to 
increase yields of crops dramatically.  He also agreed to look 
into working to assist a poultry farm the group visited.  DUSD 
Brinkley also promised to facilitate communication between 
American agricultural investors and experts and Karbala's 
farmers and the agricultural DG (Note: we will do this at the 
Regional Embassy Office in Al Hillah by DVC as a first step to 
see where the conversation leads.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) DUSD Brinkley's visit was accorded media coverage 
throughout the day.  For this reason alone, the visit was highly 
successful.  In a PIC province where the PRTs had little access 
until two months back, the subliminal media message from Karbala 
government is that American groups are welcome to come to 
participate in the business of reconstruction and develop 
business ties.
