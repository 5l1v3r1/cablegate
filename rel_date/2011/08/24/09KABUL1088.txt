MORE POWER TO KABUL 
 
¶1. (U) Summary.  Continued progress in the building and 
rehabilitation of Afghanistan's energy transmission and distribution 
infrastructure will soon result in additional power reaching Kabul. 
The North East Power System (NEPS) will handle the additional import 
of Uzbek power after a joint government/donor coordinated effort 
successfully energizes and commissions a new 220kV transmission 
line.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Since late January, Kabul has been receiving 40MW of 
electricity from Uzbekistan through an "extension cord" devised and 
implemented by various donors (including USAID) to alleviate harsh 
winter conditions at the behest of the Inter-Ministerial Commission 
on Energy (ICE).  This transmission operates through older 110kV 
infrastructure and originates from the Amu substation in Uzbekistan, 
bypassing the new distribution network of the NEPS, which operates 
at 220kV.  Beginning this week, a team consisting of various 
personnel from the Ministry of Energy and Water, DABS (national 
electric utility), and donor funded contractors will "energize" the 
new 220kV transmission network originating at the Surkhan substation 
(Uzbekistan) and ending in Kabul.  Once this process is completed, 
an additional 50-90MW of power will be delivered to Kabul. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Preparations to energize NEPS have been under way for the 
past two months in order to ensure safe transmission and little or 
no disruption of power to Kabul or Mazar-e-Sharif.  The process 
involves hot testing and commissioning of each segment/substation 
independently and sequentially.  The energization process is 
particularly difficult because portions of the NEPS have not been 
completed, necessitating various technical workarounds.  To execute 
the 220kV commissioning, the 110 kV supply must be shut off, 
effectively reducing the power Kabul now receives by 40MW.  Expected 
to begin as early as April 30, the shut off is projected to last 
five days.  However, actual duration will be governed by technical 
problems encountered during the energization process. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Kabul residents have grown accustomed to increased 
electricity supply (average 12-16 hours daily) since the inception 
of the "extension cord".  Diesel fuel (provided using USAID funding) 
has been stockpiled at the NW Kabul diesel generation plant to 
replace the power that will be lost during the energization process. 
 There is sufficient diesel fuel at NW Kabul for up to 20 days of 
operation. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment.  Additional energy supply to Kabul will 
undoubtedly improve city morale and provide additional impetus to 
enhanced economic activity.  Nevertheless, additional electricity 
translates to larger payments to the Uzbeks, compelling DABS to 
reduce transmission losses and improve tariff collection 
expeditiously.  The U.S. Mission is supporting this reality by 
funding the commercialization of Kabul's Electricity District (KED). 
 This proposal is currently awaiting final signature by SRAP 
Ambassador Holbrooke.
