¶1.  Post welcomes and grants country clearance to Dr. Joe 
Harford, Director, Office of International Affairs, National 
Cancer Institute, NIH, to travel to Dublin and Galway, 
Ireland, from February 28 to March 5, 2006.  Purpose of the

required.  Embassy telephone number while in country is (01) 
668-8777 during business hours; (01) 668-9612 after hours. 
 
GENERAL TRAVEL INFORMATION 
 
¶3.  There are no visa requirements for visitors traveling to 
Ireland on diplomatic or official passports. 
 
¶4.  Please note that as of March 29, 2004, Ireland has 
instituted a smoking ban in the work place, including all 
pubs, restaurants, and hotel common areas.  Violations of 
this law may result in a fine of up to Euro 3,000.  Check 
with hotel staff upon arrival to determine if smoking is 
permitted in hotel room. 
 
¶5.  Travelers may take the Dublin Aircoach (7 Euro one way, 
departure every 15 minutes) or a taxi (approximately 25 Euro 
one way) to city centre. 
 
¶6.  Accommodation Exchange:  Post does not have check cashing 
or money changing facilities.  Major credit cards are widely 
accepted; ATM machines accept most major U.S. bankcards, and 
offer the best exchange rates. 
 
SECURITY INFORMATION FOR IRELAND 
 
¶7.  Post is unaware of direct threats against Americans or 
U.S. interests in Ireland, and Ireland remains a relatively 
safe country where anti-American sentiment is rare.  For 
additional threat assessment information regarding Ireland, 
you may contact DS/DSS/ITA (Diplomatic Security's Office of 
Intelligence and Threat Assessment) in the State Department 
at 202-663-0787.  TDY visitors staying longer than 30 days 
should schedule a briefing with the Regional Security Officer. 
 
¶8.  Street Crime: Like any large urban center, Dublin has its 
share of street crime, especially pick-pocketing and 
purse-snatching.  Valuables should not be left unattended in 
cars and should be kept in hotel safe deposit boxes.  Do not 
carry large amounts of cash.  Violent confrontations and use 
of firearms are rare, however, and with reasonable 
precautions and common sense visitors should be able to enjoy 
a safe visit.  Police services are excellent; the number for 
emergency services in Ireland is 999 or 112. 
 
¶9.  Terrorism: Ireland, like the rest of the world, shares an 
increased threat of terrorist incidents of international 
origin.  Travelers should remain aware of their surroundings 
and report suspicious people or activities to the police or 
RSO.
