SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: POST-SHIPMENT VERIFICATION: 
MOSCOW STATE UNIVERSITY, INSTITUTE OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS, 
DEPT. OF NUCLEAR REACTIONS, MOSCOW, RUSSIA, LICENSE 
NO. D368648 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel 1 requested a Post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Moscow State University, Institute of Nuclear 
Physics, Dept. of Nuclear Reactions, Moscow, Russia. 
The company is listed on BIS license application 
D368648 as the ultimate consignee of a Cryopulse 5 
cryostat.  This item is controlled for national 
security, missile technology, crime control, regional 
stability, anti-terrorism and UN sanctions reasons 
under ECCN 6A002. The licensee is Canberra Industries, 
Inc., 800 Research Parkway, Meriden, CT 06450. 
 
¶3. On August 3, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with Moscow State 
University (MGU), Institute of Nuclear Physics (IONP), 
Dept. of Nuclear Reactions (DONR), Leninsky Gory, 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with 
Nikolay Eremin, Chief Scientist. 
 
¶4. IONP was founded in 1949-1950 at MGU to provide 
students with a course of study in the atomic sciences 
and nuclear physics.  The DONR boasted the best 
equipment available at the time, including particle 
accelerators and a cyclotron for the production of 
radioisotopes.  Currently the department's major focus 
is on the measurement of space radiation for the 
development of nanosatellites.  IONP employs 1200 in 
three buildings on the campus of MGU.  Buildings 20 
and 19 are principally used by IONP.  Building 19 
houses the particle accelerators, which are five 
stories below ground.  Building 20 also has its 
nuclear research laboratories 100 meters below ground, 
to insulate from solar and ground radiation sources. 
 
¶5. The cryostat in reftel is used to study the 
reactions of the nucleus when charged particles are 
forced through the nucleus wall.  The results of the 
study will aid in the understanding of nuclear 
processes, which can be applied to a number of 
academic projects.  The project has no direct military 
use or support.  Funding for the equipment was 
provided by a grant from Detrilit Company, a 
metallurgical firm in Moscow. 
 
¶6. The team was shown a Canberra Industries Cryopulse 
5 Model CP-5SL CITS 97-8465 Serial # 1102.  Digital 
photographs of the unit were taken and are available 
from post upon request.  The device is integrated into 
a complex system of devices, which is in a locked room 
with a motion detector security system in place. 
Access to the room is limited to Dr. Eremin and his 
assistant, Anton Pashalov.  No other research is 
conducted utilizing the equipment. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Moscow State 
University, Institute of Nuclear Physics, Dept. of 
Nuclear Reactions, Moscow, Russia as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
