SUBJECT: JORDAN-IRAQ BORDER OPEN 
 
REF: CPA 929 
 
¶1. While several recent erroneous reports have stated or 
implied that the border between Jordan and Iraq has been 
closed, this border has in fact remained open at all times 
during at least the last four months.  Since the end of major 
combat operations in Iraq, the only closures of this border 
have been those initiated on the Iraqi side of the border. 
The Iraqi side of the Trebil border crossing is the 
responsibility of U.S. Armed Forces personnel, who are in 
constant, direct contact with CJTF-7.  The Jordanian side of 
the Trebil border crossing is the responsibility of the 
Jordanian Public Security Directorate (PSD).  However, 
liaison officers attached to the General Headquarters of the 
Jordanian Armed Forces are also stationed at the Trebil 
border crossing to monitor the situation there and maintain 
cooperation with foreign military forces.  These liaison 
officers are in constant contact with U.S. liaison officers 
attached to the Humanitarian Assistance Coordination Center 
(HACC), which is based at U.S. Embassy Amman. 
 
¶2. If the Jordanian government ever does decide to close the 
border for any reason, the Embassy will report this to both 
the Department and CPA soonest.
