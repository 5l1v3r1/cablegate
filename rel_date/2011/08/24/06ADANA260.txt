ZAMAN/HURRIYET/RADIKAL/CUMHURIYET/SABAH: Concerning the 
explosion of a boiler in a military residential building in 
Diyarbakir on December 11, 2006, the Chief Public Prosecutor of 
Diyarbakir -CPPD- Durdu Kavak, announced that eight persons had 
been killed and 5 persons, including the janitor, 
boiler-caretaker and repairmen, had been detained on the charges 
of "attempting to kill people accidentally." In response to 
whether the explosion was a terrorist incident, the CPPD said 
that the five persons, who had been detained, had never been 
involved in terrorist acts, but that possibility was    also being 
probed. 
 
ZAMAN: The DTP Provincial Chair of Erzurum, Bedri Firat, has 
been given 10 months of imprisonment and 47 Turkish Liras of 
fine for addressing to PKK's Leader as "Mr. Ocalan" in 2004 and 
having a poster of Ocalan in the party's office. Firat said that 
the decision was political and he would appeal it at the Supreme 
court. 
 
HURRIYET/EVRENSEL: Because of the events that broke out during 
the lynching attempt on December 04, 2006 of Abdullah Basci, a 
rapist who allegedly raped and killed 2 thirteen-year old girls 
and harassed several others, 1 person had been killed and 76 
others had been wounded. Of the 29 persons detained by police 
before and after the events on 12/04/2006, 14 have been 
arraigned while the other 15 are still being interrogated. Of 
the ones who have been arraigned, 6 persons have been imprisoned 
and others have been let free to be tried in absentia. 
 
RADIKAL/EVRENSEL/EKSPRES: NGOs and some political parties in 
Adana formed a Peace and Brotherhood Initiative and marched by 
making a "Peace Chain" for solving the Kurdish issue. The Peace 
Chain formed by the Emegin Partisi (Labor Party) gathered in 
front of the Human Rights Association. A group of 40 people 
hanged banners written in Turkish and Kurdish on their necks and 
started to march. The Emegin Partisi Chairwoman, Sevil Arici, 
made a press announcement on behalf of the group and reminded 
that PKK had declared a unilateral cease fire on October 01, 
2006, and that opportunity should be evaluated well. 
 
EVRENSEL: Just prior DTP's "Elected Officials March" aiming to 
turn the cease fire declared by PKK to a lasting peace, the 
DTP's Provincial Organization in Tunceli held an indoor meeting 
with section headmen, provincial council members, municipal 
council members, lawyers, union presidents and political party 
chairpersons yesterday. The DTP Provincial Chairman, Hidir 
Aytac, claimed that provocations had increased despite PKK's 
truce and urged that everybody should do whatever falls on his 
shoulders and that they all would be responsible for the 
consequences of the process. The EMEP -Labor Party- Provincial 
Chairman, Huseyin Tunc, expressed his wishes that the truce 
would bring about the conditions for these two peoples [Turks 
and Kurds] to live together as brothers and told that everybody 
should contribute to the process. The Tunceli Mayor, Songul Erol 
Abdil, and the HRA's Tunceli Chapter's President, Attorney Baris 
Yildirim, also expressed their views in the meeting. 
 
SABAH: PKK militants are seeking for ways of having a 
comfortable winter in the mountains. While PKK shelters equipped 
with televisions and satellite dishes were discovered in rural 
Lice of Diyarbakir, one person taking heaters operating with 
solar energy to PKK was arrested in Nusaybin of Mardin. The 
solar energy was equipped with high technology and could be 
programmed to operate remote booby traps and recharge radio 
batteries with solar energy as well.

ADANA 00000260  002 OF 002 
 
 
that Turkey processed only %7 of its production and that the 
best way of rescuing that product was to go into 
industrialization. Kavak said that the citrus production season 
in Turkey lasted for three or four months but in rivaling 
countries, such as Spain and Italy, the season was all year 
long. Mr. Kavak added that the Turkish producers should also 
diversify their citrus varieties and try to produce all year. 
Mr. Kavak said that Turkey was processing only 189,000 tons in 
its industrial plants of its 2,398,000 tons, which corresponded 
to %7 of its production. The Spanish FMC Food Technologies S.L. 
Citrus Systems Murica  Company officials gave a presentation to 
the producers at the conclusion of the meeting held at Hiltonsa.
