SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO UNCLASS STATE 43120, INFORMATION ON FORCED AND 
CHILD LABOR IN THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS 
 
REF: A. STATE 43120 
 
¶1. (U) As requested under the Trafficking Victims Protection 
Reauthorization Act of 2005, Section 105, post has no reason to 
believe that goods produced in Sudan are produced with forced or 
child labor in violation of international standards. While child 
labor is rife in Sudan, high unemployment means the few 
goods-producing positions available in the severely underdeveloped 
country are generally filled by men, mostly migrants from rural 
areas to large cities. 
 
¶2. (U) Working children are central to the economic activity of a 
majority of the households and communities in Sudan, but the 
majority of children working in Sudan is employed in herding and 
cultivating subsistence crops. In cities and towns, boys generally 
work in restaurants, as porters, in construction, making bricks, and 
selling goods for traders.  Girls primarily work as domestic 
servants, in construction, making bricks, making charcoal, and 
selling tea or spices. 
 
¶3. (U) Post was unable to find evidence to warrant a determination 
that the incidence of forced labor or exploitative child labor in 
the production of a good is significant to Sudan. Post asks DOL to 
contact post should DOL desire to verify or corroborate information 
on certain goods.
