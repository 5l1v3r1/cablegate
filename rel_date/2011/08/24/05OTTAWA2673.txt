ITS PARIS CLUB DEBT SWAP CEILING TO 50 PERCENT FROM 30 
PERCENT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 163071 
 
¶1. (SBU) Finance Canada tells us that the GOC believes Jordan 
benefitted from exit treatment (that is, it was not expected 
back at the Paris Club) and does not need more debt 
assistance.  On debt swaps more generaly, Finance officials 
are concerned that swaps are often used for trade distortion 
and, at the last G-7 meeting, asked for a methodology 
discussion on use of debt swaps.  They have not heard that 
there is any momentum within the G-7 for such discussion. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Finance has not given recent full consideration to 
the specific case of Jordan's request for an increase in its 
debt swap ceiling.  They asked if the USG plans to raise the 
issue at the next Paris Club meeting, noting that it is not 
on the agenda.
