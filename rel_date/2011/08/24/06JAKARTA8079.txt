(SBU) Minister of Trade (MOT) Mari Pangestu, MOT Secretary 
General Hatanto Reksodipoetro, and MOT Director General for 
International Trade Cooperation Herry Soetanto left for the 
WTO trade minister meetings in Geneva on June 26.  As such, 
on June 27 we delivered the U.S. refined services request for 
Indonesia to Pangestu's office at the MOT and asked her staff 
to convey it to her in Geneva.  We also delivered on June 27 
ref A talking points and the refined U.S. request to MOT 
Directorate General for International Trade Cooperation WTO 
Director Gatot Prasetyo Ajie.  Gatot noted that the 
Government of Indonesia (GOI) would base its services 
negotiation positions on prevailing Indonesian laws and 
regulations.  He noted that the GOI and Indonesia's 
Parliament were in the process of considering a new 
investment law and implementing regulations that would 
hopefully improve foreign participation in Indonesia's 
services sectors.  Regarding our Education requests, Gatot 
said Indonesia might have some flexibility on mode 3, but not 
modes 1 and 2.  Gatot noted that the EU and Australia had 
recently sent teams to Jakarta to discuss WTO services issues 
with Indonesia, and he asked whether the U.S. services 
negotiators would consider a similar visit.
