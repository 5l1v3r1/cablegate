SUBJECT: CHICAGO MAYOR DALEY PROMOTES 2016 OLYMPIC BID 
 
¶1. (U) Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, accompanied by a 
delegation of eight including E.ON and Committee 2016 chairman 
Patrick Ryan, Richard Karr, Chairman of International 
Organizations Department/Sister Cities Program, and Mrs. 
Margaret Daley, visited Barcelona November 19-22 to push 
Chicago's bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics.  The delegation came 
to Barcelona to gain insights from the city's experience hosting 
the games in 1992.  New Barcelona mayor Jordi Hereu hosted the 
Chicago delegation and offered tours to the Olympic sites, many 
of which continue to be used today. 
 
¶2. (U)  While here the delegation held a number of meetings with 
current and former Olympic officials, including regional 
President Pascal Maragall, former International Olympic 
Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch, former Barcelona 
mayor Narcis Serra, and Josep Miquel Abad, General Manager of 
the Barcelona Olympic Committee.  A center piece of the visit 
was Mayor Daley's November 20 presentation to the American 
Chamber of Commerce where he presented a slideshow highlighting 
Chicago's merits as an Olympic city candidate.  At a lunch 
hosted by the CG, Mayor Daley exchanged views and information 
with several business executives, who were important to bringing 
the Games to Barcelona. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  Mayor Daley told his interlocutors he was 
here "to learn from the Catalans how they continue to draw on 
the success of the Games fourteen years on."  He did not leave 
disappointed.  The delegation will return to Chicago with a 
number of well-received ideas that will be useful should 
Chicago's candidacy prove successful.  Barcelona officials were 
forced to tread lightly with this visit since Madrid is also 
advancing in its effort to hold the 2016 Games.  End Comment.
