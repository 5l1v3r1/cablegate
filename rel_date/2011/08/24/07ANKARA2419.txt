Turkey-Iraq to Sign Anti-Terror Deal Thursday 
All papers report that Turkey and Iraq are expected to sign an 
anti-terror agreement today as a follow up to the memorandum of 
understanding that was agreed on in an August visit to Turkey by 
Prime Minister al-Maliki.  The agreement is expected to include 
Turkey's right to "hot pursuit" of PKK terrorists across the border. 
 Milliyet says the deal will also include the establishment of 
liaison offices in the Iraqi Embassy in Turkey and the Turkish 
Embassy in Iraq for anti-terrorism coordination.  Vatan and 
Cumhuriyet say "coordination offices" will be set up on the 
Turkey-Iraq border.  Cumhuriyet also says that in order to implement 
a "hot pursuit" operation, Ankara will have to get permission from 
President Talabani and regional Kurdish administration leader 
Massoud Barzani.  Visiting Iraqi Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani 
and his Turkish counterpart Besir Atalay are expected to sign the 
deal Thursday. 
 
Meanwhile, Zaman reports Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told 
his Turkish counterpart Ali Babacan in New York that the Iraqi 
government supports the memorandum.  Zebari also welcomed Turkish 
plans to open a consulate in Basra. 
The two foreign ministers have agreed to work for the success of the 
expanded Iraq neighbors' meeting to take place in Istanbul in 
October. 
 
Erdogan Meets Ahmadinejad, Livni in New York 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan was invited to join a 
"roundtable meeting of democracy partners" held under the auspices 
of President Bush.  Turkish diplomatic sources said Turkey was 
invited to join the meeting of countries with "fledgling 
democracies" as an "exemplary model of democracy."  Erdogan also met 
with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and asked her to convince 
Washington to invite Turkey to the Middle East conference to be held 
in November.  Radikal says Livni gave Erdogan details about a recent 
Israeli air attack against Syria.  Erdogan also came together with 
Iranian President Ahmadinejad to discuss Iraq and Iran's nuclear 
program.  Papers point to the fact that the meeting took place the 
day US House adopted a decision to sanction international companies 
that invest in Iran.  Several papers note that Turkey and Iran have 
recently agreed that the state-owned Turkish oil company TPAO would 
invest around USD 12 billion in Iran.  Sabah says the two leaders 
also discussed the US reaction to Iran-Turkey energy cooperation. 
 
Before meeting with Ahmadinejad, Erdogan came together with a 
delegation of Jewish representatives, from whom the PM asked support 
against the Armenian genocide bill in the US Congress, papers 
report. 
 
 
 
US Senate Adopts Bill for a 'Loose Federation' in Iraq 
Sabah, Vatan, Cumhuriyet, Yeni Safak and others report that US 
Senate has approved a bill submitted by Senator Joe Biden, which 
calls for a "loose federation" of three semi-autonomous regions in 
Iraq.  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet says even though the bill is 
not binding, it paves the way for the disintegration of Iraq in the 
future. 
 
Paper: Turkish Military Wants a Prospective Kurdish State Blocked 
 
Tabloid Aksam, commenting on recent remarks by Turkish Land Forces 
Commander General Ilker Basbug who had issued "tough" messages to 
the US on the PKK, says the military sees prevention of the 
establishment of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq as a top priority 
for Turkey.  The military is ready to take all risks including 
fighting with the US to prevent such a development, according to the 
paper.  Basbug also warned the US that in combating the PKK Turkey 
wanted to see US action and not words.

Editorial Commentary on US-Turkey Relations and the PKK 
Fikret Bila writes in the mainstream daily Milliyet: "When the Land 
Forces Commander General Basbug made those very harsh remarks 
against the US, he was trying to underline the ongoing uneasiness 
with the situation in Iraq and with cooperation with the US against 
the PKK.  The Turkish military expects to see tangible signs of 
sincerity from the US regarding Iraqi territorial integrity and the 
fight against terrorism.  Iraq's territorial integrity is an issue 
related to the threat assessment of the Turkish military.  The 
military considers an independent state in Iraq's north as a primary 
threat from a strategic point of view.  Such a development is 
assessed as a 'vital threat against the Turkish state' and the army 
remains committed to reacting at a whatever-it-takes level. 
Regarding threat assessments, Kirkuk is number two and PKK is the 
third, in the Turkish military's priority order.  The Turkish 
military continues operations against the PKK in the region yet 
absolute success has not been achieved.  The military is aware of 
the fact that this problem cannot be resolved through only military 
means.  In this context, it is also aware of the fact that a 
military operation by the US against the PKK will not be able to end 
the problem, either.  However both Ankara and the military are 
waiting to see a clear stance from the US against the PKK, such as 
the capture of few chieftains to hand over to Turkey.  An action as 
such that will not only restore the US image in Turkey, but will 
also diminish PKK members' hopes for US help.  Some events are 
important simply because they happen, just like concrete action by 
the US against the PKK.  Otherwise the Turkish army is not happy 
with the fact that Iraq and PKK issues are driving a wedge between 
Turkey and the US." 
 
Sukru Kucuksahin writes in the mainstream daily Hurriyet: "General 
Basbug gave very a serious message to the US when he called for 
'deeds not words.'  It is no secret that the Turkish military is 
highly disappointed by the lack of the expected level of support 
from the US regarding the fight against the PKK.  Such concrete 
support would have a positive impact on restoring the US image in 
Turkey which is as low as 7 percent.  Currently the US is being 
presented with a very big opportunity to do that.  Ongoing 
operations against the PKK by the Turkish army can be supported by 
concrete action of the US.  For example if the US captures a few PKK 
leaders and hands them over to Turkey, this will create significant 
demoralization within the terrorist organization.  Such an action 
will certainly not end the PKK problem but it will definitely be a 
morale boost for the Turkish army.  The Turkish army is also very 
clear about taking every possible action at all costs if a separate 
state in Northern Iraq is established, and wants this to be known by 
the entire world, including by the US.  If the US makes a gesture 
like handing over PKK leaders, it will ease things and help to 
create a positive image among the Turkish public.  A restored 
American image in Turkey will make the Turkish military very happy, 
for sure." 
 
US State Senators Group Visits Istanbul 
Mainstream Sabah reports 22 US state senators have arrived in 
Istanbul September 24 in a tour organized by Senate Presidents' 
Forum for meetings with business leaders such as elite business 
grouping TUSIAD's honorary chair Rahmi Koc, TOBB Chairman Rifat 
Hisarciklioglu and TUSIAD deputy chairperson Umit Boyner.  Fred 
Risser (Wisconsin,) John Revens (Rhode Island,) David Williams 
(Kentucky,) and Rosa Franklin (Washington) are among the members of 
the group which also has some 30 representatives of US food, 
medicine and liquor companies such as Novartis, Unilever, 
Anheuser-Busch, and Tyco.  The delegation is to leave Istanbul 
September 30.
