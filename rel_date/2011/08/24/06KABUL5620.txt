¶1. (SBU) Afghanistan began its Hajj operation on November 22, and to 
date has transported slightly over 4000 Hajjis, in spite of some 
ongoing hurdles.  GoA and Afghan air carriers have managed to 
solidify their plans for moving the some 24,000 Hajjis from four 
Afghan cities to Jeddah.  State-owned carrier Ariana has had one 
flight a day the past several days from Kabul, carrying about half 
of the total passenger load.  Private carrier KamAir has begun 
flights from Herat, Mazar, and Kandahar.  The Embassy greatly 
appreciates support provided by AmEmbassy Riyadh and AmConsulate 
Jeddah in getting the SAG to act on approving safe aircraft from the 
two Afghan carriers (reftels). 
 
¶2. (SBU) In spite of good progress, including success in securing 
air assets and requisite slots, Saudi visa issuance capacity here 
has emerged as a new issue.  The problem is the Saudis have not been 
issuing visas fast enough to utilize the available slots.  The 
Afghan MFA has been working to address this problem with the Saudi 
Charge D'Affaires here, and have confirmed to us that they have now 
reached agreement for the Saudis to provide 1000 visas per day. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT:  Although flights (aircraft and slots) are 
available to haul nearly 2000 Hajjis a day, the average after four 
days was less than 800 per day, which led to a number of delayed or 
cancelled flights.  At this rate it would take 26 days to finish, 
assuming perfect weather, but there are only 26 days left, and 
weather issues are a constant factor here.  If successfully 
implemented, the MFA agreement with the Saudis here to increase visa 
issuance would strengthen the viability of the Afghan Hajj 
operation. While the overall situation has taken a distinct turn for 
the better, we are continuing to monitor it closely and respond to 
ongoing requests for support from the Ministry of Transportation.
