SUBJECT: CANADIAN PM WELCOMES AFGHAN RUN-OFF ELECTION 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Prime Minister Harper on October 20 expressed 
pleasure that both leading Afghan presidential candidates had 
recognized the need for a run-off election, encouraged the people of 
Afghanistan to participate in the second round of elections, and 
reiterated Canada's continued support.  He had earlier telephoned 
President Karzai, urging him "to maintain an unqualified commitment 
to the constitutional democratic process in Afghanistan."  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On October 20, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal 
statement on the release of the official certified results by the 
Afghan Independent Election Commission.  The statement expressed 
pleasure that the two remaining presidential candidates acknowledged 
the need for a run-off election "in the best interests of Afghan 
democracy," underscoring that "Canada has consistently stated that 
all parties must respect the Afghan electoral process and the Afghan 
constitution."  Affirming that "our goal in Afghanistan is to help 
Afghans rebuild their country as a stable, democratic and 
self-sufficient society," PM Harper underscored that "it is 
particularly important that these elections are an Afghan-led 
process."  PM Harper encouraged the people of Afghanistan to 
participate in the second round of elections, and confirmed Canada's 
continued support of the process.  (Full text in para 5.) 
 
¶3. (U) PM Harper had telephoned President Karzai on the afternoon of 
October 19, according to the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, 
Dimitri Soudas.  PM Harper urged President Karzai "to maintain an 
unqualified commitment to the constitutional democratic process in 
Afghanistan" and "noted that Canada and the international community 
have strongly supported the rebuilding of Afghanistan under 
President Karzai, the first democratically national leader in the 
country's history."  President Karzai reportedly asked PM Harper "to 
convey to Canadians his [Karzai's] continuing gratitude for the 
sacrifices made by Canada for the future of his country." 
 
¶4. (U) Canadian media also cited remarks by an unidentified "senior 
official" that PM Harper had firmly advised Karzai that, if he tried 
to govern without a legal mandate, Karzai would face dire problems, 
not just with Canada, but with the entire international community. 
 
 
¶5. (U) The text of the October 20 statement follows: 
 
"The Government of Canada acknowledges the final results released 
today by the Independent Election Commission for the 2009 Afghan 
Presidential Elections. 
 
We are pleased that both candidates recognized the need for a 
run-off election in the best interests of Afghan democracy. Canada 
has consistently stated that all parties must respect the Afghan 
electoral process and the Afghan constitution. 
 
While the first round of elections was not without controversy, it 
is important to remember how far Afghanistan has come since the fall 
of the Taliban regime.  Our goal in Afghanistan is to help Afghans 
rebuild their country as a stable, democratic and self-sufficient 
society. 
 
Canada continues to lend our support as Afghans proceed into the 
second round of elections.  This is an important step in the 
country's ongoing transition to democracy.  It is particularly 
important that these elections are an Afghan-led process. 
 
We encourage the people of Afghanistan to actively participate and 
vote in this second round of elections.  We continue to encourage 
the Afghan government and the IEC to set the necessary conditions 
for a secure, transparent and inclusive second round of elections." 
Qfor a secure, transparent and inclusive second round of elections."
