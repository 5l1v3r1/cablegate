Kinshasa welcomes the Crisis Management Exercise 
proposed for September 21 and 22.  Primary POC for the 
training is A/RSO Michael Jordan.  He will be 
coordinating at this end with S/GSO Barry Copenhaver. 
The following provides other information requested in 
reftel, paragraph 6.  The other requested details will 
be provided via e-mail on or before August 21. 
 
¶1.  The dates specified in reftel are acceptable to 
post.  If the trainers maintain the order of visits and 
general schedule as outlined, they will probably arrive 
in Kinshasa via Johannesburg mid-day on Sunday, 
September 19.  This will allow for set-up and in-brief 
with the Ambassador and DCM on Monday, September 20, 
overview training on the 21, and Crisis Management 
Tabletop Exercise in the morning of September 22. 
Onward travel to Brazzaville would be by Brazzaville 
speedboat or commercial speedboat late in the afternoon

¶2.  Kinshasa will examine the Alternate Command Center 
readiness standard prior to the to the CME. 
 
¶3.  The tabletop exercise will preferably include 
cleared Americans, critical LES employees, and at least 
one Amcit warden.  We would like to include additional

up scheduling two of these on September 21.
