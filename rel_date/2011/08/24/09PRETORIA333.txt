¶1. (SBU) Summary.  State-controlled South African Airways (SAA) 
announced the creation of a task team to probe a second drug bust of 
SAA crew members in London on suspicions of carrying five kilograms 
of cocaine.  Crew members were detained in London and released to 
South Africa pending further investigation.  The task team will 
review existing security measures and oversee the implementation of 
additional interventions.  South African officials also sought post 
advice for U.S. best practices to improve air carrier security 
compliance.  This latest drug bust comes at a time when the 
airline's international reputation is already suffering from 
mismanagement, financial turmoil, and labor unrest (Reftel B).  End 
Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
SECOND DRUG BUST IN TWO MONTHS 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) SAA announced on February 17 that it has formed a special 
task team aimed at stopping drug trafficking through SAA and any 
other carriers that operate from South African airports.  This 
follows the second arrest of a SAA crew at Heathrow Airport, in 
London, on charges of drug trafficking (Reftel A).  Fifteen SAA crew 
members were detained on the SAA crew bus by UK Customs officials 
for allegedly carrying approximately five kilograms of cocaine in an 
SAA-labeled corporate bag.  A UK Customs spokesperson told the media 
the estimated street value of the drugs was #250,000 ($358,000), but 
the value has not been confirmed. 
 
¶3. (U) South African Interpol and National Crime Intelligence 
spokesperson Senior Superintendent Tummi Golding said the crew would 
return to South Africa and would be questioned by crime intelligence 
officers and the Airports Company of South Africa (ACSA). 
 
¶4. (U) According to press reports, the second drug bust was almost 
identical to last month's at the same airport.  In that incident, 
one SAA crew member was arrested in London and a security guard 
employed by the company contracted by SAA to screen the crew's 
luggage was arrested in South Africa.  Both court cases are 
pending. 
 
-------------------------------- 
TASKFORCE TO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL 
SECURITY MEASURES REQUIRED 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The new task team is expected to review the measures that 
were implemented by SAA following the first incident in January and 
manage the implementation of additional security measures.  The team 
will comprise representatives from SAA, ACSA, South African Revenue 
Service (SARS) customs officials, and the South African Police 
Service (SAPS).  The measures introduced by SAA following the 
January incident included changing security systems, adding physical 
searches of bags, and using sniffer dogs airside.  These and other 
measures will now be extended across all SAA international flights. 
However, press reports are indicating that the sniffer dogs SAA 
intended to use to screen the crew's luggage after the January 
incident had only been used once. 
 
¶6. (U) Institute of Security Studies Analyst Prince Mashele told the 
local media that criminals were using sophisticated methods to evade 
security points to smuggle drugs in a press interview.  "Technology 
at the airports needed to be continuously upgraded because criminals 
Qat the airports needed to be continuously upgraded because criminals 
find ways to out-do law enforcement," noted Mashele. 
 
------------------------------- 
POST SHARES U.S. BEST PRACTICES 
------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) SARS officials raised the drug bust incidents during a 
February 17 meeting with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Attache 
and Transportation Officer.  The SARS officials explained that the 
issue was being taken seriously by customs and ACSA officials and 
inquired about best practices in the U.S. to ensure carrier security 
compliance.  CBP Attach explained that the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security promoted programs such as the Carrier Initiative 
Program (CIP) that encouraged carrier compliance by utilizing 
incentives such as security training instead of relying solely on 
monetary penalties for non-compliance.  Through the CIP, the CBP 
 
PRETORIA 00000333  002 OF 002 
 
 
provides anti-drug smuggling training to air, sea and land 
commercial transport companies (carriers).  The training is directed 
at employees of air, sea and land commercial carriers. Those 
carriers with route systems that are high-risk for drug smuggling 
voluntarily sign agreements with the CBP. 
 
¶8. (U) SARS officials also sought post advice about efforts to 
improve the interface between customs and enforcement agents.  CBP 
Attache offered to organize a meeting with the Immigrations and 
Customs Enforcement Attache at post to further discuss U.S. best 
practices.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) This latest drug bust comes at a time when the 
state-controlled airline is already facing mismanagement, financial 
turmoil, and labor unrest.  Temporarily-appointed SAA Acting CEO 
Chris Smyth will have to work with other government stakeholders to 
ensure that additional security measures are implemented and 
enforced to redeem the airline's international reputation.  The 
recent arrest of two entire crews might also increase tension 
between cabin and cockpit crews.
