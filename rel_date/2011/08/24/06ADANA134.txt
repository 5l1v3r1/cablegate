POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
HURRIYET:       The security forces, who continued military 
operations following the PKK members' killing of one soldier and 
wounding 8 more on Bingol-Elazig road (see press summary 06/05), 
killed three PKK members. 
 
HURRIYET / EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM / CUMHURIYET:        An armored 
vehicle had an accident in Tunceli and one police officer has 
been killed. 
 
EVRENSEL:       DTP (Democratic Society Party) decided that it will 
annul the co-chairmanship model. 
 
RADIKAL / HURRIYET / OZGUR GUNDEM / CUMHURIYET / YENI SAFAK: 
The Hurriyet and Yeni Safak dailies carried in their front page 
coverage the outrage that was sparked among people in Van's 
Muradiye district when a Swiss national female biker who was 
touring the world with a friend on a bicycle was attacked and 
raped by five men in the district six days ago.  Five hundred 
people, infuriated by that incident, gathered at the district 
and, in vigilante-style, targeted the assailants as they were 
being brought out of the prosecutor's office in the district. 
Security forces were not able to calm down the crowd, and 40 
anti-riot team members had to be sent to the district. 
 
HURRIYET (CUKUROVA):    One person was killed in fighting that 
broke out between two families in Mardin's Kiziltepe district. 
 
HURRIYET (CUKUROVA):    As a result of the joint operations of 
the Diyarbakir, Mersin and Van police, seventy kilograms of

HURRIYET (CUKUROVA) / ZAMAN:    Upon receiving a tip-off, Adana 
Jandarma Command teams found in a truck 17 tons of crude oil 
stolen from pipelines in Ceyhan. 
 
ZAMAN:  Recent deployment of military units at the border 
areas with Iran reportedly decreased the level of fuel-oil 
smuggling from Iran to Turkey. 
 
EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM / ZAMAN:        Evrensel and Ozgur Gundem 
dailies report that Selahattin Aksu, who was shot dead with his 
daughter with 92 shots fired from two firearms in Mardin's 
Kiziltepe district (see press summary 06/05), was detained one 
week ago at a jandarma station in the district on charges that 
Cannabis plant was found in his field.  Aksu was allegedly 
threatened by a senior officer there then. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Britain's The Guardian newspaper reported that 
Kurdish youth have been going to the mountains to join the ranks 
of the PKK because of the oppression the state has been exerting 
in the southeastern region.  Reportedly, last month, 100 young 
persons, who can no longer put up with such oppression, have 
joined the PKK. 
 
EVRENSEL:       Women in Adana held a march to demand from
