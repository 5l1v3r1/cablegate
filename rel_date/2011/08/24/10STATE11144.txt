SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050212038 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050212038 for the export of 
rifle parts and components to Germany.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: Waffen Schumacher is importing 
components for the AR15 rifle but has no license history of 
importing AR15s.  This request is to determine if the company 
is manufacturing AR15 rifles and, if so, whether the finished 
product is being sold outside of Germany. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to determine the 
ultimate end-use of these rifle parts and components and 
establish the bona fides of Waffen Schumacher by making 
inquiries to representatives of the company and appropriate 
German authorities.  Specifically, Post is requested to 
determine if the company is manufacturing AR15 rifles and, if 
so, where the finished products are being sold.  The 
following points are included for guidance: 
 
(To Waffen Schumacher) 
 
--When was your company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What products and services does your company provide?  Who 
are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--What are your annual sales of U.S.-origin firearms and 
components? 
 
--For what will these AR15 components be used?  Do you 
manufacture AR15 rifles?  If so, where do you market these 
rifles?  Where are they sold?  What is the model nomenclature 
used by your company for these rifles?  Do you export any 
rifles that contain U.S. components? 
 
--Do you have any manufacturing or distribution agreements 
with any U.S. companies?  If so, please provide the agreement 
authorization number and any related documentation. 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To Appropriate German Authorities) 
 
--Is Waffen Schumacher properly authorized to import and sell 
defense articles in Germany?  Is Waffen Schumacher authorized 
to export firearms from Germany? 
 
--Do you have any information on Waffen Schumacher that would 
question their reliability as a recipient of U.S. defense 
articles? 
 
In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any 
information pertinent to this transaction such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
