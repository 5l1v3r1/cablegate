TRAINING 
 
¶1. (SBU) The newly-established Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) 
Air Force is awaiting the delivery of ten Mi-17 helicopters that are 
being manufactured by the Russian Kazan Helicopter Plant. In 
preparation of this equipment's arrival, SPLA troops are undergoing 
air maintenance, repair, and flight training. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to SPLA contacts, the SPLA Air Force has ordered 
ten Mi-17 helicopters from Russian Helicopter Manufacturer, Kazan 
Helicopter Plant, based in Tatarstan, Russia.  Of the ten 
helicopters, five will be outfitted with dual fuel tanks, four with 
single fuel tanks, and one will be used as a VIP carrier.  With the 
order of these aircraft comes a one-year service, parts, and pilot 
training contract.  If it is assessed that helicopter maintenance 
and repair personnel, as well as pilots, still require training and 
technical support at the end of the contracted year, an unidentified 
organization based in Ethiopia reportedly will provide these 
services for an additional year.  According to a high-ranking SPLA 
Air Force source, these helicopters are to be used strictly for 
non-offensive purposes to include the transport of personnel and 
supplies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Kazan has three different types of Mi-17 helicopters: the 
Mi-172, which is strictly for passengers and VIPs; the Mi-17-V5 
which is used for the transport of cargo and personnel; and the 
Mi-17-1V which is a multi-purpose helicls the SPLA has ordered. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In anti#ipation of the arrival of these aircraft an 
unidentified number of SPLA personnel have begun maintenance, 
repair, and flight training.  Some SPLA soldiers have been training 
at the Denel Centre for Learning and Development located at Kempton 
Park in South Afriaa.  According to earlier reporting, other SPLA 
soldiers have been receiving air force training at an undisclosed 
location in Ethigpia. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Cgmment: In developig an air borce it makes sense for the 
SPLA to starp with transport he,icopTers.  Moving 3oldi%rs abd 
supplies )n the South is often a #hallenge civen the poor road 
infrastructure, and mgst airstrips !re often unusable for f)xed 7ingQ 
aircraft in Qhe rainy season.  Helic/pterQ dramatically incr%ase the 
SPLA's logist)cal capabilities and al4hough they are hig( 
maintejance, they ca. be 0ut ib serrice rela$ivel9 quickly.  The 
SPLA will need tm pl!n fu,ly for the downstr%am cost of maintaining 
the helicopters, which will further strain an !lready over-extended 
SPLA budget.
