SOLUTION FOR COMPENSATING JUDGES 
 
REF: A. A. USUN 104 
 
     ¶B. B. STATE 10709 
 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) UN Assistant Secretary-General for Legal Affairs 
Larry Johnson advised Amb. Wallace on February 6 that the 
Lebanese Government is provisionally amenable to the 
new proposal described in ref A for compensating the Lebanese 
judges for the risk associated with their service to the 
Special Tribunal for Lebanon, but awaits final approval for 
this proposal from PM Siniora. The GOL is now trying to 
identify the required funds in the Lebanese budget and 
determine how to transfer those funds to a bank account in 
New York for the judges' use. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Under this proposal, as soon as the UN announces 
the Lebanese judges' selection but before the judges assume 
their duties, the Lebanese government would make a lump-sum 
payment into a blind trust account at JP Morgan. The sum 
would not exceed the equivalent of USD 5000 for each month 
the Lebanese judges are expected to serve on the Tribunal. 
According to Johnson, the payment would be comparable to the 
UN's evacuation payments to staff, which are the equivalent 
of USD 4,800 per month. JP Morgan, as trustee, would make 
incremental payments to the judges from the trust as long as 
the UN certifies to JP Morgan that the Lebanese judges are 
continuing to serve on the Tribunal.  At the UN's request, 
the Management Committee would have no role in establishing 
or administering the blind trust. 
 
¶4.  (U) COMMENT:  As this proposal falls within reftel 
instructions, Mission plans to support it within the 
Management Committee of the tribunal, assuming the GOL 
identifies the required funds.  END COMMENT.
