SUBJECT: RESPONSE RE PROPOSED NIH RESEARCH PROJECT 
 
REF: STATE 120136 
 
Â¶1. In response to reftel, Embassy sees no potential U.S. 
foreign policy concerns regarding NIH's proposed award to 
the research project entitled "Prospective Studies of Avian 
Influenza Transmission in Asia," No. AI068803, pending human 
subject approval.  Post understands research institutions 
involved are the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa and the 
Naval Medical Research Unit 2 (NAMRU-2) in Jakarta, 
Indonesia.  Please note that this Naval Medical Research 
laboratory is operated by USG personnel and the principal 
investigator is a USG employee.  Please also note that State 
120136 incorrectly lists the laboratory as Naval Medical 
Research Center Detachment, APO AA 34031, which is for the 
Naval Laboratory in Peru.  The correct listing for Indonesia 
should be NAMRU-2, FPO AP 96520-8132.
