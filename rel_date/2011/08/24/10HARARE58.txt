--------------------------------- 
On the Political and Social Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  The State mouthpiece, The Herald, reported this week that 
following a ZANU-PF Politburo meeting -- the 49-member senior 
decision-making body of the party -- the party resolved not to make 
any additional concessions to the MDC in negotiations until the 
"illegal? sanctions have been lifted. The announcement mirrors party 
resolutions made in December at the five-year ZANU-PF Congress. 
ZANU-PF has long maintained that the MDC has the capacity to 
pressure the West to lift sanctions, an argument that was bolstered 
by recent statements by British Foreign Secretary David Miliband who 
said that the UK would consult with the MDC in determining whether 
to lift sanctions. 
 
¶3.  High Court Justice Barack Patel on January 26 rejected the 2008 
SADC Tribunal ruling that upheld the rights of a group of white 
commercial farmers who lost their farms under the controversial land 
reform program. Patel stated that supporting the decision would be 
contrary to Zimbabwe?s domestic laws and agrarian policies and would 
result in political upheaval. He added, "The greater public good 
must prevail." and abiding by the SADC ruling "... would entail the 
eviction, upheaval, and eventual relocation of many, if not most, of 
the beneficiaries of the land reform program." SADC has not issued 
any statements regarding Patel?s judgment. 
 
¶4.  Four white commercial farmers in the Chipinge area of 
southeastern Zimbabwe were given 24 hours to vacate their farms by 
local magistrate Samuel Zuze. The four farmers -- Algernon Taffs, 
Dawie Joubert, Mike Odendaal, and Mike Jahme -- had been harassed by 
local youths hired by the beneficiaries and Jahme and Taffs were 
both evicted after Zuze refused to accept an urgent High Court stay 
of execution granted on January 27. Joubert and past Commercial 
Farmer?s Union President Trevor Gifford were arrested and held 
overnight on contempt of court charges while attempting to protest 
Zuze?s actions. Zuze himself is trying to acquire one of the farms. 
(See offer letter below.) 
 
¶5.  Co-chair of the Parliamentary Select Committee on the 
Constitution, Douglas Mwonzora (MDC-T) announced that the political 
parties have agreed that two members of each of the 70 outreach 
teams will now verify the official reports of their respective 
Qteams will now verify the official reports of their respective 
consultation meetings. The compromise resolved a dispute over who 
should verify the team?s reports. Critics charge that having two 
politically-linked rapporteurs defeats the purpose of a supposedly 
unbiased and people-driven constitutional reform process. 
Separately, Mwonzora has been charged with insulting the President 
by allegedly calling Mugabe a "goblin" at a rally in 2008. If 
convicted, Mwonzora would face up to one year in jail. 
 
¶6.  Three prominent civil society groups -- Zimbabwe Lawyers for 
Human Rights, Zimbabwe Peace Project, and Zimbabwe Election Support 
 
HARARE 00000058  002 OF 003 
 
 
Network - on January 27 held a meeting in Harare announcing the 
launch of the ZZZICOMP project that will attempt to independently 
monitor the upcoming constitutional outreach program. ZZZICOMP will 
consist of 420 monitors who will attend all public constitutional 
meetings to ascertain if the outreach process is marred by violence, 
intimidation, or coercion. The monitors will not be identified and 
will report their findings to both the government-led JOMIC 
monitoring group and the greater public. 
 
¶7.  On January 25, 11 of the 200 women marching with Women of 
Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) in Bulawayo were beaten by police who 
disrupted the peaceful march. The women were marching to deliver a 
report on the collapse of education in Zimbabwe. They were held for 
several hours and then released without charge. The women were 
treated for soft tissue bruising caused by the police officers? 
batons. 
 
¶8.  On January 27, Judge Bhunu postponed the trial of Roy Bennett to 
February 3 when he will rule on whether to admit e-mails allegedly 
downloaded from the laptop of impeached star witness Peter 
Hitschmann in 2006. The emails link Hitschmann and Bennett in a plot 
to overthrow Mugabe and commit terrorist activities. Bennett?s 
lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa, opposed their admission, arguing that the 
court had already ruled they were inadmissible. She said the e-mails 
could easily have been authored by state security agents. Hitschmann 
denied any knowledge of the e-mails. Earlier this week, Judge Bhunu 
ruled statements made by Hitschmann after his arrest that implicated 
Bennett were inadmissible since they were the result of beatings. 
 
----------------------------------- 
On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
¶9.  Zimbabwe?s Supreme Court has ordered the Reserve Bank of 
Zimbabwe to keep diamonds from Chiadzwa in safe custody, pending the 
resolution of the dispute between African Consolidated Resources 
(ACR) and the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC). ZMDC 
began mining diamonds in Chiadzwa while ACR was contesting the 
cancellation of its license in 2007. Although the court ruled that 
the diamonds must be kept by a neutral party, it is not certain the 
diamonds will be safe given the RBZ?s record of stealing statutory 
reserves and foreign currency deposits of companies and NGOs in its 
custody in recent years. 
 
¶10.  According to a report in The Herald, ZISCO?s re-birth is 
imminent following the forwarding of two short-listed bidders to the 
President. Arcelor Mittal and Jindal Steel are reportedly vying for 
a stake in ZISCO. During its peak, ZISCO was one of the largest 
integrated steel manufacturers in Africa with a potential to produce 
between 700,000 and 1 million tons of steel and employing over 4,000 
people. But years of poor management and inadequate capital took its 
toll on the company, which ended up employing just 1,000 workers and 
selling scrap metal accumulated over 40 years to survive. 
Qselling scrap metal accumulated over 40 years to survive. 
 
¶11.  EU ambassadors accredited to Zimbabwe have recommended the 
removal of eight state-owned enterprises, including ZISCO, ZB 
Holdings, ZimRe Holdings, and the Industrial Development 
Corporation, from the sanctions list in response to a request by PM 
Tsvangirai. According to a report in the Financial Gazette, the move 
is designed to help Zimbabwe?s recovery. 
 
¶12.  The Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), a subsidiary of the 
state-owned Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority, has said that the 
country?s power problems will continue for some time with only one 
out of six generating units at Hwange operating. The ZPC report says 
that the available total internal power generation capacity is 
enough to satisfy 53 percent of the forecast maximum demand, with 
the bulk of supply coming from Kariba. Hwange Power Station which is 
operating at just 13.4 percent capacity.

Quote of the Week 
----------------- 
 
¶13.  The Herald caught our attention this week with an unusual 
headline: "10 huts burnt in Buhera political violence." -- Further 
reading reveals that the article charges MDC-T supporters of burning 
the homes of ZANU-PF office holders and supporters in the area. One 
traditional leader, Chief Chitsunge, reported that the attacks came 
after "repeated threats by some MDC-T supporters" who had allegedly 
ordered that all ZANU-PF meetings be stopped in the area. We have 
yet to confirm the veracity of the report and eagerly await the day 
when The Herald dedicates the same coverage to victims of ZANU-PF 
abuse.
