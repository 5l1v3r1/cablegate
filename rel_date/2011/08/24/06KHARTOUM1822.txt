SUBJECT:  SUDAN/DARFUR:  NEW FIGHTING ERUPTS BETWEEN SAF, 
SLM/MINAWI, AND NRF IN NORTH AND WEST DARFUR 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Fresh fighting has erupted in both North and West 
Darfur between Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), allied with rebels from 
the Sudanese Liberation Movement/Minawi (SLM/Minawi) faction, and 
militias from the National Redemption Front (NRF).  The fighting is 
notable because it is the first time since the signing of the Darfur 
Peace Agreement (DPA) on May 5 that the SAF has initiated attacks on 
rebels remaining outside the agreement.  Both sides continue to mass 
forces, so fighting is likely to flare up yet again.  Charge Hume 
has several high level meetings in the coming days, and will raise 
the matter with the government.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On July 26, approximately 50-100 SAF military vehicles, some 
mounted with anti-aircraft weapon systems and rocket launchers, and 
fuel trucks assembled at the El Geneina airport.  Soldiers were 
observed in full battle gear waving flags and shouting 
pro-government slogans.  They later headed northeast, reportedly 
towards Jebel Moon, a mountainous area along the Sudan-Chad border. 
A SAF spokesman described the fighting in Jebel Moon as operations 
aimed at preventing rebels from looting from civilians. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a separate (though perhaps related) incident on July 28, 
a SLM/Wahid rebel spokesman accused the SAF of attacking Kulkul 
(North Darfur), approximately 35 km north of El Fasher, using 
Janjaweed, three attack helicopters, and Antonov aircraft, in the 
process forcing hundreds of civilians to flee to safety in El 
Fasher.  A SAF spokesman later confirmed the clashes, but said that 
it was NRF rebels who initiated the attack by ambushing its forces. 
SAF denied the use of either Janjaweed or aircraft in the fighting. 
The African Union and United Nations issued a joint statement late 
on July 28 condemning the violence and blaming the government and 
Janjaweed for the attack on the NRF.  The UN and AU also recalled 
that an attack on any party to the Darfur conflict is either a 
breach of the DPA or a violation of previous agreements concluded on 
the basis of the N'Djamena Ceasefire Agreement.  UNSRSG Pronk plans 
to visit the region August 1.  The U.S. Representative to the CFC 
will ask for an investigation into to the attacks.  AMIS identified 
the SAF build-up of troops and supplies over several days, but did 
not/not ask them what was happening.

Current situation 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Jebel Moon: Contacts of ARC officer El Fasher report no 
ongoing fighting in the vicinity of Jebel Moon.  Apparently, after 
attacking Jebel Moon from both the north and south, NRF rebels were 
able to push SAF elements back.  UNDSS suspects the first attacks 
were probing; SAF massed near Gosmina (NFI), probably awaiting a 
go-ahead for offensive operations within the next 24-72 hours.  SAF 
composition includes at least 50 vehicles, supported by Janjaweed. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Kulkul: Kulkul has been relatively quiet since the fighting 
on July 28.  The SAF has continued its ongoing build-up in El 
Fasher.  ARC officer in El Fasher reports there is a distinct 
increase in the number of soldiers and policemen openly carrying 
weapons.  In addition, an SLA/Minawi contingent of 70 vehicles is 
moving toward Kulkul from Haskanit.  Another report states that an 
SLA/Minawi element of 80 vehicles is moving west to seal off parts 
of the border with Chad.  At the El Fasher airfield three Hind 
attack helicopters and two Antonov bombers are currently parked. 
ARC officer reports that the helicopters have been conducting 
operations. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  It appears that the Sudanese government may be 
using the post-DPA signing period as an opportunity to attack those 
outside the agreement.  Specifically, it intends to encircle both 
rebels with ties to Chad, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) 
and remaining holdouts who have coalesced into the recently-formed 
National Redemption Front (NRF).  An assortment of armed groups that 
remained outside of the peace agreement, including Chadian-sponsored 
elements, are known to be taking shelter in the Jebel Moon 
mountains.  End comment.
