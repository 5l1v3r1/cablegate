Summary 
------- 
¶1. (U) On July 6, 2005, the Department of Minerals and 
Energy increased the prices of gasoline, diesel, and 
kerosene to all-time highs.  Two-thirds of the increase 
was due to a weaker rand and one-third to the higher 
international crude oil price.  End Summary. 
 
Government Announces Substantial Price Increases 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
¶2.   (U) On July 6, the Department of Minerals and Energy 
(DME) increased the retail price of gasoline in rand 
terms by 5.7% and wholesale prices of diesel and kerosene 
by an average of 10.5% and 8.9%, respectively.  The 
primary contributors to the increases were the decline in 
the average rand/dollar exchange rate (from 6.28 to 
6.77), which accounted for 67% of the increase, and the 
rise in the international price of crude oil, which 
accounted for 33% of the increase.  The tables below show 
the increase in the average price of fuel in Johannesburg 
and components for the new price.  While the change in 
the equivalent dollar price is small, the change in the 
rand price is large.
