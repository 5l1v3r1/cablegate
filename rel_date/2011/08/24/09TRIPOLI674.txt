AGREEMENT 
 
REF: TRIPOLI 621 
 
¶1. (SBU) MFA Secretary of the Americas Department, Ahmed Fituri, 
told  Charge August 17 that Libya was ready to sign the 
government-to-government agreement on spent nuclear fuel (highly 
enriched uranium-low enriched uranium).  However, Fituri said 
the MFA was unsure which agreement to sign and requested the 
latest versions in English and Arabic.  Post has provided the 
Libyan Government with an English translation of the 
mutually-acceptable version of the agreement and is working with 
the Department of Energy to obtain another official Arabic 
translation of the agreement for the MFA. 
 
¶2. (SBU) As a sign that Libya is ready to move forward on the 
final steps of the agreement, the MFA renewed visas for the two 
DOE technical experts who are leading U.S. cooperation on the 
nuclear spent fuel project with Libya's Atomic Energy 
Establishment.  The DOE experts will travel to Libya next week 
to conduct final preparations of Libya's nuclear spent fuel for 
shipment to Russia for treatment and disposal. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post will continue to report on Libya's progress in 
transferring its nuclear spent fuel to Russia by the September 
2009 deadline.  Department's assistance in obtaining an official 
Arabic language translation of the agreement would be greatly 
appreciated.
