Summary 
------------ 
 
¶1.  Thousands of customers in Khabarovsk began a run on the 
Dalkombank, withdrawing almost 2.4 billion rubles in cash -- 
four times the usual monthly amount.  The withdrawals between 
October 8 and 12 were fueled by rumors of the bank's impending 
collapse.  The rumors appear to have been started by corporate 
raiders hoping to create a rapid decrease in the bank's value 
before initiating a hostile takeover. 
 
The Panic Begins 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  Thousands of Dalkombank customers in Khabarovsk began a run 
on the bank, withdrawing 2.4 billion rubles in cash -- quadruple 
to usual amount -- between October 8 and 12.  Bank customers 
began the frenzied withdrawals after rumors circulated around 
Khabarovsk of the impending failure of the bank.   The Central 
Bank of Russia stepped in to assist Dalkombank by providing 
liquidity to meet the cash demand of customers.  Dalkombank 
management extended banking hours to process customers' 
requests, and offered increased interest rates to customers who 
kept their funds at the bank.  Bank president Andrey Shlyakhovoy 
gave a press-conference to calm the public's nerves, and by 
October 13 the run ceased. 
 
This is How Rumors Get Started 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  On October 21 Shlyakovoy gave his explanation for the 
incident to the media, stating that the rumors of the bank's 
troubles had been started by unnamed corporate raiders planning 
to target the bank in a hostile takeover bid.  He also asserted 
that "some banks in Western Russia have already been targeted in 
such attacks." 
 
¶4.   Aleksandr Levintal, the Head of Khabarovskiy Kray's 
Economic Development and Trade Department, engaged in some 
damage control as well, assuring Khabarovsk inhabitants that the 
bank is sound and that the Khabarovsk banking system is 
sufficiently isolated from world banking activity, and therefore 
less susceptible to global financial problems.  He explained 
"our banks do not receive loans from abroad and do not invest in 
stock markets." 
 
¶5.  According to a journalist contact in Khabarovsk, the rumors 
that caused the panic were indeed spread by corporate raiders 
from VTB 24 Bank, a subsidiary of Vneshtorgbank, as the opening 
salvo in its takeover of Dalkombank.  Representatives of other 
Khabarovsk banks have refrained from commenting on the 
situation, though some did acknowledge that the rumors about the 
bank were clearly deliberate disinformation. 
 
Gubernatorial Machinations? 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Governor Viktor Ishayev has an involved history with both 
Dalkombank and Vneshtorgbank.  A consulate contact in Khabarovsk 
told consulate staff that the Governor has held a grudge against 
Dalkombank leadership ever since it refused to provide financial 
assistance to Dalavia, a Khabarovsk-based airline that recently 
filed for bankruptcy (reftel).  Ishayev subsequently ordered all 
official Kray bank accounts transferred from Dalkombank to 
Vneshtorgbank, supposedly as punishment.  This move provided at 
least a plausible foundation for the rumors of impending 
financial doom for the bank. 
 
¶7.  During the panic, Governor Ishayev conspicuously refrained 
from making public statements in support of the bank.  This is 
in contrast to a number of incidents in the past when he 
actively shielded local businesses against aggressive takeovers 
by Moscow-based business concerns.   Observers point out the 
precedence of Artel Amur Gold Mining -- when Ishayev did not 
step up to defend the local company in January 2007, raiders 
successfully took the company over. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  Though there is no confirmed connection between the governor 
and the rumor-induced panic on Dalkombank, such implications 
made by local observers are plausible.  Ishayev still wields 
considerable influence over Khabarovsk residents, and the fact 
that he made no public statements in support of a large, local 
bank is cause for concern.  It is also clear that, though often 
a staunch defender of local companies subject to takeover, he 
chose not to help the company that many believe he holds a 
personal grudge against.
