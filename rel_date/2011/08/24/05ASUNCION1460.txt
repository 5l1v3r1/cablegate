RESOLUTIONS 
 
REF: A. ASUNCION 1448 
     ¶B. STATE 213779 
 
¶1. Following up on Charge's 11/25 discussion with Vice FM 
Ginenez (ref A), PolOff met with MFA International 
Organizations Director Julio Peralta on 11/29 to clarify 
Paraguay's voting posture on ref B resolutions.  Peralta 
confirmed that Paraguay would vote "yes" on the resolutions, 
consistent with its votes last year. 
 
¶2. Peralta noted that the GOI has not/not requested that 
Paraguay vote a certain way on any specific UN resolution -- 
neither in discussions with VP Castiglioni in Israel last 
week, or in its communications with the MFA -- but rather has 
asked Paraguay to continue to support the UN's deliberative 
process for achieving peace in the Middle East.
