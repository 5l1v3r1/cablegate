¶1. (SBU) Accompanied by Russian and South Korean diplomats, 
we jointly delivered Ref A invitation on March 17 to Szymon 
Bochenski of the MFA's Security Policy Department, who said 
there was a 50/50 chance that a Polish police representative 
would attend the April 14-16 Global Initiative Exercise 
Planning Group (EPG) and Workshop in Seoul.  Bochenski said 
Poland's internal security services and Border Guards could 
not attend because of travel budget cuts this year.  Only the 
police service suggested the possibility of sending a 
representative.  Bochenski said he would follow up with event 
organizers when a final decision was made. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bochenski did not comment on the EPG agenda and 
objectives (Ref B), but he advocated enhanced integration of 
Global Initative activities with those of the Proliferation 
Security Initiative, which he described as "extremely 
complementary, despite differences in the participation base."
