SUBJECT: SOMALIA - PRIME MINISTER, SPEAKER, MEDIA REACT TO 
YUSUF'S RESIGNATION 
 
REF: NAIROBI 2879 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Summary:  In remarks to the media following 
Transitional Federal Government (TFG) President Yusuf's 
December 29 resignation (reftel), the TFG Prime Minister and 
Speaker offered generally muted praise to the President for 
leaving office and thanks to the international community for 
the role it has played.  Alliance for the Re-liberation of 
Somalia (ARS) Chairman Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed made no 
public comment about Yusuf's resignation. An aide ascribed 
Sheikh Sharif's silence to the lack of a suitable forum in 
which to comment. The Somalia media were generally reserved, 
reporting the facts of the address to Parliament with only a 
bit of anti-Yusuf commentary.  End summary. 
 
Prime Minister and Speaker Offer Diplomatic Praise 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In remarks to the media in the hours following TFG 
President Abdullahi Yusuf's December 29 resignation (reftel), 
TFG Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein Nur Adde offered only 
muted praise for the former President.  Hussein hoped Yusuf 
"would become a Somali elder who will play a substantial role 
in the peace process and the country's development," and 
termed his resignation a giant step along the road toward 
democracy.  Hussein assured the Speaker of his complete 
support as he supervised the transition to a new president, 
and urged other TFG officials, the militias, and the public 
to continue to work for reconciliation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a press conference immediately after escorting 
Yusuf to the Baidoa airport December 29, Speaker of 
Parliament Sheikh Aden Madobe seemed more focused on a 
potential security vacuum than the President's resignation. 
Madobe asked the public to remain calm and hoped, with the 
support of the international community, that Yusuf's 
departure would not trigger "chaos."  Madobe promised that no 
one would be victimized during the transition period. 
(Reports from Baidoa suggest that Madobe remains preoccupied 
with security:  he spent most of December 30 huddled with 
security and law enforcement representatives.)  In comments 
to BBC later December 29, Madobe praised Yusuf for 
voluntarily relinquishing power, unlike "other African 
statesmen." 
 
Sheikh Sharif Silent 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) 
Chairman Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed to date has remained 
silent on the issue of Yusuf's resignation.  An aide to 
Sheikh Sharif in Mogadishu told us December 30 that there had 
not yet been an appropriate opportunity to comment, and that 
the ARS leader did not want to force the issue.  In an 
interview published the day of Yusuf's resignation, but 
probably conducted earlier, Sheikh Sharif defended the ARS's 
alliance with the TFG, without mentioning the conflict 
between the President and the Prime Minister. 
 
Somali Media Generally Reserved 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Somali media outlets, often not bashful with their 
commentary, generally stuck to the facts of the resignation. 
Most articles and reports repeated the details of the address 
to Parliament and submission of the resignation letter, and 
several reviewed details of Yusuf's nearly-40-year career in 
the Somali military and politics.  One outlet described the 
genesis of Yusuf's resignation as "a vinegary power struggle 
in the country's beleaguered transitional government" and 
asserted that Yusuf "made no tangible progress" while 
President.  An editorial on a Somali website stated that, 
"Disagreements and public squabbling between the President 
and the Prime Minister led to the resignation of the 
President after he was pressured by an international 
community which saw him as an obstacle to peace."  Another 
media outlet noted that, "(Yusuf's) close alliance with the 
Ethiopian military alienated many Somalis who consider the 
Ethiopians as occupiers." 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Neither the Prime Minister nor the Speaker offered 
the more extensive praise that we had urged in the days 
preceding the President's resignation.  Their long struggle 
with Yusuf seemed to have left Hussein and Madobae unable to 
 
NAIROBI 00002891  002 OF 002 
 
 
use the opportunity to reassure jittery members of Yusuf's 
circle as the TFG begins an effort to create a unity 
government with members of the ARS.
