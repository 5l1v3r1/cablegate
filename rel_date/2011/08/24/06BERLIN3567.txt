¶1. (U) On December 20, the Berlin Criminal Investigation 
Service's (LKA) office for combating trafficking raided 
eighteen locations in Berlin and executed eight arrest 
warrants.  According to a press release issued by the Berlin 
LKA, police and Berlin prosecutors had been conducting 
investigations since 2005 against several different 
cooperating crime groups allegedly involved in severe 
trafficking, illegal pimping, kidnapping, personal injury, 
document forgery, and alien smuggling.  The police found that 
at least twelve persons were involved in smuggling women from 
Eastern European countries into Germany with forged passports 
and forcing them into prostitution.  Police allege three 
brothels in Berlin and five Internet agencies forced the 
women to prostitute themselves or used threats to prevent 
them from leaving. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Police and prosecutors announced they will continue 
to question witnesses and evaluate evidence seized in the 
raids.  According to the LKA's press officer, police 
investigators will conduct standard checks to determine 
whether illegal migrants identified in the raids are TIP 
victims.  If so, police will work with NGOs and local 
authorities to ensure victims receive necessary counseling 
and social services and take steps to permit victims to 
remain in Germany as victim witnesses.  Since the 
investigations are still ongoing, the LKA officer could not 
say whether and how many trafficking victims were found 
during the raids.  It is unclear at this time when the 
suspects will be indicted. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Heike Rudat, who heads the Berlin LKA's 
anti-trafficking office, the LKA's success in combating TIP 
is due primarily to the existence of a specialized office 
dedicated solely to TIP investigations.  The office closely 
monitors the activities of brothels and Internet agencies in 
Berlin.
