¶1. (SBU) Summary.  In a September 22 letter to the 
Ambassador, German MFA DepSec-equivalent Reinhard Silberberg 
strongly lobbied the USG to support German Ambassador Peter 
Gottwald for Director General of the Technical Secretariat of 
the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 
(OPCW).  Silberberg underscored the importance that Germany 
places on Gottwald's candidacy and noted the German cabinet's 
role in the nomination.  German MFA Political Director Volker 
Stanzel has personally lobbied the Ambassador in support of 
Gottwald as well.  In a recent meeting with POL M/C, Gottwald 
also emphasized the weight that Germany has placed on helping 
him secure the Director General slot.  Paragraph 4 contains a 
translation of Silberberg's letter.  End Summary 
 
¶2. (SBU) On September 14 Gottwald told POL M/C that German 
officials were making every effort in support of his 
candidacy, underscoring that many remained troubled by the 
dearth of Germans at the helm of multilateral organizations. 
Most importantly, however, Gottwald said Germany saw him as a 
good fit for the OPCW.  As a result, he was being very active 
in campaigning -- making recent trips to Australia and Latin 
America.  Gottwald emphasized that his candidacy had the 
direct support of the Chancellor's office (CDU) and the 
Foreign Ministry (SPD), projecting strong bipartisanship. 
Gottwald understood that he was under stiff competition 
amongst the field of seven candidates -- particularly from 
Turkey and the U.K. -- however, he was cautiously optimistic 
that he could garner broad support for the job.  Nevertheless 
he placed particular importance on securing support from the 
U.S.

Comment

¶3. (SBU) Germany's interest in the OPCW position is 
consistent with its long-standing, deep interest in 
disarmament.  Moreover, the German government's continuing 
support of arms control suggests that Gottwald would enjoy 
high-level backing for his work at the OPCW should he land 
the Director General position.   In our experience, Gottwald 
has proven to be open and engaging with U.S. officials and 
comes across as a polished and capable interlocutor.  End 
comment. 
 
¶4. (U) Begin text of letter to Ambassador Murphy: 
 
Excellency, 
 
Allow me to draw your attention to a matter of high political 
priority for my country. 
 
The Federal Republic of Germany has, by a Cabinet decision, 
nominated Ambassador Peter Gottwald as its candidate for the 
post of Director-General of the Technical Secretariat of the 
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). 
I would like to request your support for his appointment 
within the OPCW Executive Council. 
 
Ambassador Gottwald is the Federal Government Commissioner 
for Disarmament and Arms Control, and a renowned expert on 
disarmament issues.  He played an active role in the 
successful endgame negotiations for the Chemical Weapons 
Convention (CWC).  The general impression is that his 
presentation to the Executive Council at The Hague in 
mid-July was highly convincing. 
 
The CWC is a success story.  It is the only agreement which, 
in a non-discriminatory way, bans a whole category of WMDs 
and mandates their destruction.  Nonetheless, it is facing 
several challenges for the future.  We want to achieve the 
universality of the Convention and the destruction of all 
chemical weapons within the set deadlines. 
 
The appointment of the new Director-General takes place at a 
decisive point in time: The destruction of all chemical 
weapons will be completed over the next decade.  The OPCW 
will therefore soon have to readjust its position within the 
international disarmament architecture.  During that phase it 
will need a Director-General able to think in a 
future-oriented fashion and who has the necessary diplomatic 
and leadership skills. 
 
From Ambassador Gottwald's enclosed curriculum vitae you will 
see that he is especially well-qualified to meet these 
challenges alongside the member states, thus ensuring that 
 
BERLIN 00001233  002.3 OF 002 
 
 
the OPCW will continue to meet the high expectations in the 
future.  Your Government's support for his candidature would 
mean a great deal to us. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
Reinhard Silberberg (signature)
