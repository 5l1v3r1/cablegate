SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS LAUNCHES PROBE AFTER CREW IS BUSTED 
IN LONDON FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  South African Airways has launched a probe into 
the arrest of South African Airways crew members in London on 
suspicion of drug trafficking on January 20.  The fifteen-member SAA 
crew, including three pilots, who were arrested in London and 
detained for 24 hours, has been released on bail until March 23. 
British and South African law enforcement units are investigating 
whether proper security checks occurred prior to departure in South 
Africa.  End Summary. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) The crew of SAA Flight Number 234 were arrested at Heathrow 
International Airport after 50 kilograms of cannabis with an 
estimated value of R2.1 million ($210,000) and four kilogram of 
cocaine with an estimated value of $208,000 were found in three of 
their bags on January 20.  The UK Border Agency said in a statement 
that the drugs were discovered in three pieces of baggage that had 
arrived on the SAA flight from Johannesburg.  UK Revenue and Customs 
Spokesperson Bob Geiger told the British press that all 15 crew 
members were detained for questioning and released after about 24 
hours on unconditional bail while investigations continue, including 
forensic tests on the three bags. 
 
¶3. (SBU) SAA Head of Corporate Affairs Robyn Chalmers told the media 
that, "SAA is taking this matter extremely seriously and has 
launched a full investigation, together with the South African 
Police Service (SAPS) Crime Intelligence Unit, to establish how the 
illegal substances were taken on board."  SAA crew luggage is 
supposed to undergo a thorough screening procedure at a designated 
crew center prior to departure.  However, the question of whether 
SAA or a security company conducted the required pre-departure 
checks remains unanswered.  Chalmers said the crew members would be 
monitored by Interpol while in South Africa.  SAA regards the matter 
as extremely serious, and an intensive probe by the Crime 
Intelligence Unit is under way, she emphasized. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Geiger said all 15 had been ordered to present themselves 
to the Heathrow police station on March 23.  Failure to appear could 
result in a warrant for their arrest and extradition to the UK. 
SAPS Crime Intelligence spokesperson Senior Superintendent Tummi 
Golding said both South African and British police are trying to 
ascertain how the bags got through security checks at OR Tambo 
International Airport in Johannesburg.
