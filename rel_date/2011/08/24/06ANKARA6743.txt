¶1.  Summary and Action Request: By diplomatic note, the GOT asked 
for an extension of the one-year period for using the USAID avian 
influenza related grant in an amount of $1 million for restructuring 
of the backyard poultry sector in the east.  We recall that this 
question was discussed previously with World Bank officials and 
USAID suggested that as long as the project was substantially 
started and/or funds were earmarked on a multi-year basis, there 
would be no problem.  We request that USAID provide clarification 
for us to provide to the GOT and WB.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  Diplomatic Note 2006/IEGY/533691 dated December 20, 2006 (marked 
urgent) text follows: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey presents 
its compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America and, 
concerning the cooperation between Turkey and the USA on the 
struggle against Avian Influenza, has the honor to inform the 
Embassy of the following. 
 
The Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs informs that 
the USAID has donated an amount of USD 1 million to the project of 
the World Bank on the struggle against Avian Influenza in Turkey. 
The amount of USD 250.000 of the said donation would be utilized for 
raising the public awareness. The remaining USD 750.000 has been 
allocated for the restructuring of poultry sector in Turkey. 
However, the timetable for using the donation envisaged by USAID, 
which already started as of September 2006 for a period of one year 
is not compatible with that of World Bank covering the period 
between 2008-2010 for the implementation of the project in this 
field.  Hence, pointing to the fact that the said donation could 
hardly be used within the presumed period, the Turkish Ministry of 
Agriculture and Rural Affairs proposes either an extension in the 
implementation period of the project, or a new understanding to be 
agreed by the USAID and the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and 
Rural Affairs which will enable to use this donation in areas other 
than the poultry sector as well. 
 
It would be highly appreciated if the Embassy could be kind enough 
to transmit this proposal to the USAID and inform this Ministry of 
the result.
