FM Yang Meeting with Secretary Rice 
----------------------------------- 
¶2. MFA Spokesman Qin Gang said when Foreign Minister Yang 
Jiechi met Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on November 26 
the two discussed bilateral issues and issues of joint 
concern, including Taiwan and Iran.  Yang said China would 
"play a constructive role" in resolving the Iran issue. 
According to Qin, Yang also told Secretary Rice that China 
opposes Taiwan's United Nations referendum and hopes the 
United States abides by its commitments regarding Taiwan and 
stops selling weapons to Chen Shui-bian and the Taiwan 
authorities. 
 
Six-Party Talks 
--------------- 
¶3. Qin said China is coordinating with other parties 
regarding the dates for the next Six-Party Heads of 
Delegation meeting, but has no details for release yet. 
Responding to a question on Assistant Secretary Chris Hill,s 
travels to Japan and South Korea, Qin said the United States 
and China remain in close contact.  He said the United States 
and North Korea should continue meeting on the basis of 
equality and mutual respect to improve relations.  The two 
countries should continue to work with other involved parties 
to help achieve peace and stability in the region.  Qin said 
China hopes for a successful visit "with results" by the team 
of experts, including China's Ambassador Chen Naiqing, 
visiting Yongbyon. 
 
Product Safety 
-------------- 
¶4. Qin said he was unaware of Vice Premier Wu Yi's reported 
comments to European Union (EU) Trade Commissioner Peter 
Mandelson.  However, Qin noted that the Chinese Government 
attaches great importance to food safety and that China is a 
responsible country that cares about the health of people 
around the world.  "We take a highly responsible attitude to 
manufacturing."  Qin said a Japanese report in July 2007 
found 99.42 percent of Chinese imports were considered safe 
compared to 99.38 percent of those from the EU, and 98.96 
percent from the United States.  Qin said "Chinese food is 
not only safe, but reliable."  "We acknowledge that there are 
some issues in food and product manufacturing, but these are 
isolated cases."   Qin concluded that "criticisms are not 
helpful for solutions.  All countries should be engaged in a 
joint effort to protect human health." 
 
EU Summit on RMB Appreciation 
----------------------------- 
¶5. China understands the EU's concerns about the value of the 
RMB and is ready to continue discussions on the topic, but 
hopes the EU can appreciate China's efforts over the past 
year, said Qin.  China will continue allowing gradual 
flexibility in the exchange rate in a managed float.  Against 
the U.S. dollar, the RMB has appreciated by 11.6 percent this 
year. 
 
China Congratulates Australian PM-Elect 
--------------------------------------- 
¶6. Qin said Premier Wen Jiabao has already offered his 
congratulations to Australian Prime Minister-Elect Kevin 
Rudd.  The Chinese Government continues to cooperate with 
Australia to promote the peace and stability of the region.

There is "comprehensive cooperation between the two sides" 
and the Chinese have confidence in the future development of 
the bilateral relationship.  The Chinese Government also 
expressed its appreciation for Prime Minister John Howard's 
efforts in improving relations between China and Australia. 
 
ROK and DPRK Defense Ministers Meet 
----------------------------------- 
¶7. China welcomes the recent meeting between the Defense 
Ministers of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea.  Qin said China hopes 
negotiations between the two Koreas will result in 
long-lasting peace.  China would like to see improvement of 
relations between the two Koreas. 
 
Taiwan Independence 
------------------- 
¶8. Asked whether China is insisting that a China-EU summit 
joint statement include a condemnation of Taiwan seeking 
independence, Qin said that Taiwan is part of China.  The 
"promotion of independence by Taiwan authorities undermines 
the peace and stability of the region," he said.  The EU 
adheres to the "one China" principle, Qin continued.  "We 
hope the EU upholds justice on the Taiwan question and 
opposes Taiwan independence." 
 
Banned Group Tours in 2008? 
--------------------------- 
¶9. Qin dismissed reports that Chinese tourism authorities 
intend to ban group tourism from May through August of 2008. 
"China is a major travel destination and we hope to build 
greater understanding of China's history and culture through 
tourism." 
 
Spratley Island Military Exercise 
------------------------------- 
¶10. China recently held a military training exercise in 
territorial waters around the Spratley Islands.  Qin said the 
islands are undisputedly Chinese and that Vietnam's 
accusations that China infringed on their territory were 
groundless. 
 
Chinese Naval Ship Visits Japan 
------------------------------- 
¶11. A Chinese naval ship will arrive in Japan on December 1 
in a gesture of friendship and goodwill, said Qin.  This is 
the first visit by a Chinese naval ship to Japan since 
normalization. 
 
Upcoming Visits 
--------------- 
¶12. VISITS: Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski will 
visit China from December 4-9.
