¶1. Poloff delivered ref a points to Amb. Gianludovico De 
Martino, Director of the MFA Iraq Task Force, on April 29. 
De Martino said that Italy will have a new government by the 
ICI Ministerial and was hopeful that the new Foreign Minister 
would attend.  De Martino noted that as IRFFI co-chair, Italy 
would be prepared to make a presentation about its assistance 
efforts at the conference. 
 
¶2. De Martino noted that the Italian MFA's Iraq Task Force, 
which was originally scheduled to be phased out during the 
summer, will continue until the end of the year.  De Martino 
said he would like to continue pressing to operationalize 
ICI/IRFFI mechanisms, would travel to Baghdad May 2-3 to 
discuss his ideas further with Embassy Baghdad staff, and 
would have an opportunity to meet with S/I Deputy Director 
Blakeman in Rome on May 8.
