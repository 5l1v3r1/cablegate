REF: SECSTATE 159386 
 
Pol-Econ officer met with MFA International Affairs Officer 
Joao Mora to urge Portugal to oppose, or at least abstain, in 
votes on this year's UNGA resolutions with an anti-Israel 
bias.  Mora acknowledged that Portugal had similar concerns 
regarding biased draft resolutions and agreed to distribute 
the points with Portugal's representatives in Geneva, New 
York, and Washington.  Nevertheless, Mora cautioned that, as 
EU President, Portugal would vote in keeping with the EU 
consensus opinion and therefore was likely to abstain again 
during this year's votes rather than oppose the measures.
