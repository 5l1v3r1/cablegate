SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: U.S. WEAPONS RELEASE TO IRAQ - 
ANV-20/20 FOCUSING SYSTEM 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see para 10. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Country Team requests the immediate 
release of ANV-20/20 NVD Infinity Focus System (NSN: 
6625-01-431-8615) to the Government of Iraq.  The system will 
be used by the Iraqi Air Force, the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism 
Command and Coalition Forces to train and equip a select 
number of Iraqi pilots for night operations.  This training 
will advance nighttime operational effectiveness while 
reducing collateral damage risk.  The pilots are in training 
with Coalition Forces right now, and the latter are projected 
to integrate this equipment into training beginning in 
December 2007.  The USG will fund this as part of an 
estimated $1.5M acquisition for Night Vision Devices (NVD) 
through an ISFF Funded Foreign Military Sales case.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Description of Technology for Release 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) ANV-20/20 NVD Infinity Focus Systems ensure proper 
focus for high quality binocular image clarity essential for 
safe nighttime operations.  They ensure the NVDs operate 
correctly which directly aids in the selection and clear 
identification the enemy and reduces the possibility of 
collateral damage. 
 
Rationale for Technology Release 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Iraqi Armed Forces are in urgent need of a 
viable aviation night vision capability that will allow them 
to safely and effectively support Iraqi Security Force and 
Coalition Force night operations-particularly  in conjunction 
with Coalition Special Operations Forces.  Release of the 
ANV-20/20 NVD Infinity Focus System will greatly enhance 
their ability to conduct counter-terrorism missions, improve 
interoperability with Coalition forces, and improve their 
ability to maintain their own defense and security.  Fielding 
a modern capable night vision capability contributes to 
eventual Coalition advisory transition of Iraqi aviation 
assets to independent operations. 
 
 
Iraq Safeguarding Sensitive Technology 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Iraq has demonstrated the intent and ability to 
protect sensitive, classified military technology since 
working with U.S. and Coalition forces. An Article 505 
agreement (signed by the GOI July 24, 2004) demonstrates 
Iraq's commitment to protect grant defense articles and 
technology similar to our standards. Additionally, a 
Memorandum of Agreement for Compliance for the Storage, 
Security and Inventory of Night Vision Devices was signed by 
the Iraqi MOD, 18 November 2005.  We will continue to mentor 
the GOI on their protection of sensitive USG technology in 
order to provide long-term cooperation with Iraq. We also 
will obtain all necessary formal agreements with the GOI 
before transferring any sensitive equipment or technology. 
Lastly, we will continue to carry out a robust end-use 
monitoring (EUM) through the GOLDEN SENTRY program. 
 
Anticipated Reaction from Neighboring Nations 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) We do not anticipate the release of ANV-20/20 NVD 
Infinity Focus System to the Government of Iraq to adversely 
affect the regional balance of power or cause negative 
reactions from neighboring nations, as this system is already 
fielded in many countries of the region. 
 
Iraq's Political Importance to the Region 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) A stable, democratically-elected Iraqi government, 
capable of protecting its people and sovereignty, and 
remaining at peace with its neighbors is one of the USG's 
highest priorities.  The release and employment of ANV-20/20 
NVD Infinity Focus Systems will facilitate progress toward 
this goal, advancing the Iraqi security forces' ability to 
identify, target and carry out night operations against 
anti-Iraqi forces while reducing the risk to self and others. 
 
Source of Financing and Economic Impact 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
BAGHDAD 00003679  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) This purchase will be financed as part of a NVD 
purchase using Iraqi Security Forces Funds.  The total cost 
of the entire package is estimated at $1.5M. There is no 
significant economic impact anticipated to be generated by 
this sale. 
 
Relevant Human Rights Considerations 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶9. (SBU) There are no human rights considerations that should 
preclude the release of the defense equipment to the Iraqi 
Armed Forces. 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) We request immediate Washington approval for the 
release of the ANV-20/20 NVD Infinity Focus System to the 
Government of Iraq.
