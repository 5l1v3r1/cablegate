REF: (A) STATE 140452 (B) PARIS 3967 
(C) PARIS 4170 
 
On October 10, France abstained on four biotech product votes at the 
EU regulatory committee (Reftel A).  France provided no scientific 
rationale for its action. We expect France to abstain on all votes 
involving biotechnology approvals pending the outcome of an ongoing 
environmental public process (Reftel B and C) which should conclude 
in late October/early November. Government sources confirm that 
future votes will depend on the outcome of this process, whether 
France will be prepared to adopt clear positions on biotech products 
before the next EU regulatory committee vote on November 22 - 23 
remains uncertain.
