¶1. (SBU) Per ref B, Post submits the following update for the third 
week of February 2010. End Summary.

PD Activities 
 
------------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Somalia Unit, including the Military Information 
Support Team (MIST) dedicated to Somalia, performed para. 3-8 
activities since the last report:: 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Counselor for Somalia Affairs hosted a benefit concert 
for the recovery of Mogadishu's Banadir University, whose 
graduation ceremony was the target of the December 3, 3009 suicide 
bombing in Mogadishu.  An American pianist in town for PAS 
activities volunteered to perform for an audience of about 75 
donors.  The benefit yielded nearly $8,000 to be given directly to 
the university.  Post issued a press release to Somali media and 
drafted a blog entry for the Dip Note website. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Transitional Federal Government's Minister of 
Information will arrive in the U.S. on February 23 for a working 
visit.  AF/PD is coordinating the Minister's meetings at the State 
Department.  The Minister will also visit Minneapolis and Columbus, 
Ohio to do outreach to Somali Diaspora. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post responded to several media inquiries following the 
United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator's assertions that the 
United States' efforts to prevent listed terrorist organization 
al-Shabaab from profiting from aid equated to "politicizing" aid. 
Post appreciates the Department's quick assistance with press 
guidance, and the clearance to speak on the record. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Somalia Unit assisted an NGO in publicizing the 
arrival of two 20-foot shipping containers of medical supplies to 
Mogadishu.  The press coverage highlighted private donors providing 
aid to Somalis and the TFG having a hand in delivering the 
assistance.  There was no USG footprint on this event. 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) PAO conducted an interview with Universal TV on February 5 
focusing on al-Shabaab's activity in Somalia.  PAO also gave an 
interview to new outlet Danan Radio on February 17, providing a 
broad overview of U.S. policy toward Somalia. 
 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) MIST activity: Continued development of the lecture series 
to be broadcast on Radio Mogadishu.  The team is working to link 
their contracting personnel with the appropriate TFG contacts.  The 
team hopes to start the Radio Mogadishu series on or about March 1.
