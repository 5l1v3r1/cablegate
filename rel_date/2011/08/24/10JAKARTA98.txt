SUBJECT: Indonesia Ideal for Global Entrepreneurship Program 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post recommends that Indonesia be prioritized as the next 
country selected to participate in the Department's Global 
Entrepreneurship pilot program.  We have a real opportunity to 
partner with Indonesia on entrepreneurship.  Indonesia is 
enthusiastic to cooperate; government officials and business leaders 
have already expressed interest in hosting a follow-on event to 
President Obama's Entrepreneurship Summit in Washington. 
Entrepreneurship builds on our common interests in promoting 
economic freedom and civil society, and advances relations with the 
world's largest Muslim majority country.  Indonesia's selection 
could also be highlighted as a possible theme during President 
Obama's planned visit to Indonesia later this year. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post has been in contact with the Department's Office of 
Commercial and Business Affairs (CBA) to encourage Indonesia's 
inclusion in the Global Entrepreneurship program.  We have also 
encouraged the New York-based non-profit Endeavor, which specializes 
in entrepreneurship promotion, to consider Indonesia for its first 
program in Asia.  Staff from Endeavor will arrive next week to begin 
its program assessment of Indonesia.  (Endeavor and CBA are already 
partners in Egypt.)  Cooperation in entrepreneurship provides a 
positive framework to address economic and investment climate reform 
issues and highlights our links to fast-growing Asian markets 
critical for U.S. growth.  Increased investment in entrepreneurship 
in Indonesia holds potential for significant gains. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Outreach to Muslim countries often focuses on a narrow 
definition of "civil society" that excludes the business class.  The 
President's Cairo initiative rightly highlights entrepreneurship as 
a priority area.  Entrepreneurs and business leaders wield 
significant influence in shaping Indonesia's political and economic 
future.  Enhancing our engagement with these stakeholders through 
entrepreneurship promotion is an effective means to strengthen our 
partnership with the world's third-largest democracy.
