¶1. We met with Microwave Electronic Systems, Inc. (MIKES) 
Project Manager Nurhan Ayaz Ozveren and Undersecretariat for 
Defense Industries (SSM) official Tuba Karazincir on April 15 
at MIKES headquarters in Ankara to conduct a post-shipment 
end use check on License 050111816 (ref a). MIKES is a 
well-established Turkish defense contractor.  According to 
Ozveren, security for its Ankara-based headquarters meets 
NATO AQAP-2010 standards.  Ozveren provided a thorough 
presentation regarding the purchasing history of the items 
and confirmed that EMPA delivered the 20 electrical 
connectors to MIKES on October 14.  She said the components 
are currently undergoing testing at MIKES headquarters.  The 
connectors will be integrated into an LRU-23 wideband 
receiver.  The LRU-23 wideband receiver fitted with the 
connectors will ultimately be delivered to the end user, the 
Turkish Air Force (TUAF), by 2011.  SSM,s Karazincir 
confirmed that this timeframe also reflected the Ministry of 
Defense,s understanding of the project. 
 
 
¶2. MIKES representatives were professional and fully 
cooperative during our visit, and shared with emboffs a copy 
of all the relevant documents related to this transaction, 
including an end user letter, a packing list and invoice for 
the shipment of the items from AMPHENOL Corporation to EMPA, 
an invoice from EMPA to MIKES, and MIKES' shipment acceptance 
and payment approval forms.  During the meeting, Ozveren 
arranged for the delivery of the items from the warehouse to 
the conference room and allowed emboffs to inspect them 
first-hand. 
 
¶3. We believe the information provided by EMPA (ref b), MIKES 
and SSM officials has established the bona fides of this 
shipment and confirms that the items are being used in 
accordance to the export license.
