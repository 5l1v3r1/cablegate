NOMINATING-OFFICER: Cultural Affairs Officer 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Nora Younis is a dynamic young woman who very clearly will be a 
major figure in Egyptian civic society - that is, more so than she 
already is.  Nora is one of the leaders in the community of young 
Egyptians who are advocating for more volunteerism among Egyptian 
youth.  Nora herself has been active in volunteer organizations 
for four years, and has helped organize conferences and summits to 
encourage volunteerism in Egypt.  She recently spoke at a 
conference on the subject.  After graduating from university, Nora 
tried political activism, but found the work uninspiring.  When 
she discovered the world of social volunteerism, she found her 
niche.  And she hasn't looked back.  Nora's involvement has only 
grown and it will continue to grow.  Nora is an excellent example 
for young Egyptians.  She has already, and will continue to 
inspire others to a sense of civic responsibility.  Nora would 
benefit greatly from an exposure to U.S. volunteer organizations, 
particularly those active in community development.  As a rising 
leader in Egyptian society, connections Nora would make on the IV 
program would certainly blossom and create opportunities for 
Egyptian-American dialogue and exchange in the years to come.
