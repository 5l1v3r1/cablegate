REF: STATE 063585 
 
¶1. (U) On May 31 we delivered REFTEL Agenda Proposals for the 2007 
World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC) to Victor Strelets, 
deputy head of the Department for State Programs, Infrastructure and 
Limited Resources of the Ministry for Information Technologies and 
Communications.  Strelets is also Vice-Chairman of the ITU-R Study 
Group 8. 
 
¶2. (U) Strelets said the proposals would be referred for review to 
the interagency Preparatory Commission, which includes the Federal 
Space Agency Roskosmos. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Referring to the earlier email request from the OSTP for a 
meeting in Moscow to discuss WRC 2007, Strelets said the best time 
would be July due to vacations in August.  We asked him to propose 
dates for the meeting, and we will forward any invitation when 
received.
