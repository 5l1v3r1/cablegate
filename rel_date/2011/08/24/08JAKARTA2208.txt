SUBJECT: INDONESIA - DECEMBER 3 AVIAN INFLUENZA UPDATE 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. Indonesia now has two new confirmed cases of avian 
influenza.  Ministry of Health authorities have reported one of 
these cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) but has asked WHO 
to keep this information confidential.  The MOH has not made a 
public announcement of either case report.  The WHO representative 
in Jakarta plans to discuss these cases with the Ministry of Health 
when the Indonesian delegation returns from the December 8-13 Geneva 
Intergovernmental meeting on Pandemic Influenza (IGM).  The local 
WHO office does not believe Indonesia is violating its obligations 
under the International Health Regulations (IHR).  We recommend that 
Washington raise this issue with the WHO on the margins of the IGM. 
WHO member states should be immediately notified of any avian 
influenza cases.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In early November, local media reported the fatal case of a 
15-year-old girl from Semarang.  National Institute of Health 
Research and Development (NIHRD) staff confirmed to Embassy staff 
that the victim had tested positive for avian influenza.  However, 
Minister of Health Siti Fadilah Supari publicly denied the case 
report.  When local WHO authorities questioned NIHRD staff about the 
laboratory results, NIHRD staff said that they were not authorized 
to discuss the Semarang case report. 
 
¶3. (SBU) During the week of November 24, the Ministry of Health 
notified WHO of a new laboratory confirmed case report for a 
nine-year-old girl from Riau province and asked that information on 
this case report remain unofficial.  The Ministry of Health has not 
made a public announcement of this case report.  Dr. Tjandra Yoga, 
the new Director General of Communicable Diseases and Environmental 
Health, told WHO that the Ministry will notify the WHO of new AI 
cases in compliance with the international health regulations (IHR). 
 He requested, however, that the WHO keep this information 
confidential until case reports are officially announced by the 
Ministry of Health's media unit.  Tjandra reported that the media 
unit will notify the public monthly of all new cases.  He refused to 
discuss the Semarang case report. (Indonesia released its last 
monthly report on September 10, 2008.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Over the past several months, Minister of Health Supari has 
implemented other policies to control information about AI case 
reports.  Staff in the Ministry's Operations Center can no longer 
discuss case reports with outside persons.  The Ministry has also 
notified WHO staff and other international staff that they can no 
longer participate in case investigations of patients with suspected 
AI. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The local WHO office plans to discuss these restrictions 
with the Ministry of Health following the delegation's return from 
the IGM meeting in Geneva.  But in conversations with Embassy staff, 
the WHO reported they will comply with the Ministry of Health's 
policy on not reporting AI cases until the cases are officially 
announced by the Ministry.  They stated that according to the IHR, 
WHO is obliged to keep case reports confidential if requested unless 
the cases represent a threat to other member states.  We recommend 
that the Avian Influenza Advisory Group raise this issue at a high 
level with the WHO at next week's IGM meeting to make the case that 
all AI cases are a global health threat and should be reported by 
WHO to all member states immediately under IHR.
