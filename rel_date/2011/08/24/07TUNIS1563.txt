REF: STATE 142614 
 
¶1. In recognition of the International Day for the 
Elimination of Violence Against Women (reftel), the 
Ambassador and EmbOffs visited the National Union of Tunisian 
Woman's (UNFT) Tunis headquarters, women's shelter and 
counseling center on December 5.  UNFT President Aziza Hatira 
and other UNFT officials provided an overview of the 
organization's efforts to combat violence against women in 
Tunisia. 
 
¶2. The UNFT, the nation's largest women's organization with 
over 150,000 members, operates two shelters (in Tunis and 
Sousse) for victims of domestic violence.  DOD European 
Command (EUCOM) Humanitarian Assistance funded the 
establishment of both UNFT centers in the past five years. 
 
¶3. During the visit, the Ambassador was able to meet with a 
number of women who were seeking UNFT assistance, including 
temporary lodging and legal and social services.  The 
Ambassador expressed strong USG support for UNFT's efforts to 
combat domestic violence. 
 
¶4. Post will continue its support for the UNFT and other 
organizations working to promote women's rights in Tunisia. 
We will also conduct public outreach on this issue, to 
include posting information about the UNFT visit on post's 
website.
