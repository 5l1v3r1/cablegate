SUBJECT: AF - Request for input for New Required Reports to Congress 
on Energy. 
 
¶1. (U) The following is Embassy Kabul's response to Reftel, which 
requests input for 2 new reports to Congress on energy.  Paragraph 2 
offers a brief overview of the energy situation in Afghanistan and 
U.S. objectives.  Paragraphs 3,4,5 and 6 contain the Embassy's 
responses to questions A, B, C and D in Reftel. 
 
¶2. (U) After decades of conflict Afghanistan is now a fast-growing 
economy with little or no infrastructure to support new demands from 
the public and private sector for provision of services.  Key among 
these is reliable energy.  The nation depends largely on hydropower 
generation plants installed in the 1950-60's and limited power 
imports from its neighbors (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and 
Iran), which, at this point are completely inadequate to serve 
demand, especially during the winter months when usage (primarily 
for heat) spikes.  Private sector growth is stunted, because 
whatever power is available is provided erratically, and blackouts 
are frequent, forcing business to invest in high-cost diesel 
generation in order to operate.  U.S. priorities in the Afghan 
energy sector aim to increase stability and promote sustained 
economic development by: 
 
-- working with the host government to rehabilitate current energy 
infrastructure; 
-- helping Afghanistan ensure a reliable power supply through 
installation of domestic generation, development of domestic gas, 
coal and oil resources, construction of infrastructure to enable 
large-scale power imports from its northern neighbors (Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan); and 
-- assisting energy and finance authorities in eliminating subsidies 
to the energy sector, improving performance, and boosting collection 
rates for energy consumption. 
 
¶3. (U) A. Sections of the Embassy working on energy matters and 
their total number of staff: 
 
-- Executive Office: Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission.  Total 
staff 3 FSOs, 2 OMSes.
