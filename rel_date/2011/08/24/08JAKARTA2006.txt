designations with Andy Rachmianto, Deputy Director for 
International Security and Disarmament at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs.  PolMilOff explained that the additional 
designations were consistent with obligations in UNSCR 1737, 
1747 and 1803 and with the guidance provided by the Financial 
Action Task Force on October 17, 2008.  PolMilOff also urged 
that the government of Indonesia check to ensure that no 
Indonesian firms were trading with the designated entities 
and individuals, noting the potential U.S. sanctions under 
E.O. 133382.  We left a nonpaper with the USG information.
