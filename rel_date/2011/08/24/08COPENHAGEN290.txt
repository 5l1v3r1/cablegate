¶1. Reinforcing DRL Assistant Secretary Kramer's May 13 call 
to Danish Deputy Foreign Minister Federspiel, Embassy 
Copenhagen demarched the Danish Foriegn Ministry's Asia and 
Latin America Department to encourage official Danish 
participation in the May 21 Day of Solidarity with the Cuban 
People.  Department Deputy Director Lars Bredal welcomed our 
ideas for possible messages and events, but declined to make 
any commitment beyond agreeing to consider Cuba-specific 
activities. 
 
¶2. Embassy Copenhagen will place the op-ed text provided in 
reftel in one of Denmark's leading daily newspapers, most 
likely the left-leaning "Information."
