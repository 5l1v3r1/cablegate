¶1.  (SBU) Speaking at the informal weekly "coffee" gathering 
of the North Atlantic Council on March 11, Ambassador Nuland 
told Allies the U.S. welcomed the appointment of Kai Eide as 
the Special Representative for the Secretary General in 
Afghanistan and intended to put together a series of 
high-level meetings in Washington for Eide prior to 
Bucharest.  She urged Allies to roll out the welcome mat for 
Eide in capitals in order to send him off to Kabul with 
high-level endorsements and momentum.  The Norwegian PermRep 
- speaking informally - passed along information that he had 
heard Eide's calendar would likely not permit visits to 
capitals prior to the Bucharest Summit April 2-4. 
 
¶2.  (U) SYG de Hoop Scheffer issued a statement on March 10 
welcoming the appointment of Kai Eide as SRSG and looking 
forward to working closely with him.
