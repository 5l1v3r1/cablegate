REF: STATE 112828 
 
(SBU) Pol/Econ Counselor delivered reftel demarche to Ababew 
Feleke, chief of MFA's Directorate of International 
Organizations, on November 3.  Ethiopia being very sensitive 
to outside interference in its own affairs, post emphasized 
para 10 points on the possibility of Israeli actions being 
subject to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of other 
national or international courts. Ababew was aware that the 
Human Rights Council had commissioned an investigation of the 
December-January Gaza conflict but had not reviewed the 
Goldstone report.  He absorbed the demarche appeal to oppose 
any UNGA resolution containing any of our listed offensive 
elements, but replied only that he would raise the matter 
with Ethiopia's New York Mission and within his own ministry. 
 (NOTE.  Ethiopian Minister of Foreign Affairs Seyoum Mesfin 
is leading a large delegation to official bilateral meetings 
in Washington on November 5.  END NOTE.)  As of Embassy COB 
on November 5, Ababew had provided no clarification of 
Ethiopia's position.
