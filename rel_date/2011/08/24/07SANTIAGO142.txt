On January 23, government-owned, financially autonomous TVN 
"Medianoche": A report by the U.S. Department of Defense reported 
that between 2005-2006, Venezuela spent more money on military 
purchases than China, Iran or Pakistan.  Some believe this is in 
defiance of the U.S.  Chilean defense analyst Eduardo Santos wrote 
that the U.S. cannot do anything to slow the military expenditures 
because Venezuela would stop exporting oil to the U.S., and that the 
real concern is not the weapons themselves but the ideology behind 
their purchase.  According to defense analyst Miguel Navarro, 
Venezuela's acquisition of higher technology arms poses a threat 
because it could provoke an arms race in the region.
