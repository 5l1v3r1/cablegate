SUBJECT: FRENCH SUPPORT COORDINATION ON UN FOLLOW-ON 
MISSION IN EASTERN CHAD (AND CAR) 
 
REF: A. A) STATE 118123 
     ¶B. B) PARIS 1978 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU)  EMBASSY SUPPORTS THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO 
COORDINATE WITH THE FRENCH ON CHAD POLICY IN GENERAL AND ON 
PKO ISSUES IN PARTICULAR. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  FROM OUR PERCH HERE, THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE 
CONSIDERED AS KEY OBJECTIVES OF SUCH COORDINATION REGARDING 
THE UN FOLLOW-ON FORCE (MINURCAT II) TO EUFOR: 
 
-- CAR SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE NEW MANDATE. 
 
-- MINURCAT II'S "SECURITY PACKAGE" SHOULD BE COMPOSED OF 
THREE COMPLEMENTARY ELEMENTS:  A MILITARY ELEMENT (RESEMBLING 
EUFOR); A POLICE OR GENDARME UNIT ELEMENT (FORMED POLICE 
UNITS OR THE GENDARME EQUIVALENT); AND A POLICE/GENDARME 
TRAINING ELEMENT (TO TRAIN CHADIAN POLICE AND GENDARMES. 
 
-- THE STRICTLY MILITARY ELEMENT OF MINURCAT II'S "SECURITY 
PACKAGE" SHOULD BE LIMITED TO BETWEEN 3,000 AND 4,000 TROOPS. 
IF THIS MEANS THAT MINURCAT II'S MILITARY STRENGTH IS LIMITED 
TO THREE (3) BATTALIONS AND DOING WITHOUT A DPKO-PROPOSED 
FOURTH "MANEUVER" BATTALION, SO BE IT. EUFOR'S TOTAL STRENGTH 
IN CHAD IS UNDER 3,200 TROOPS. 
 
-- THE POLICE/GENDARME TRAINING ELEMENT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO 
MINURCAT'S LARGER, POLITICAL OBJECTIVES:  FIRST, IT IS THE 
ELEMENT THAT PREPARES THE CHAD SECURITY FORCE (THE INTEGRATED 
SECURITY DETACHMENTS -- DIS) THAT ACTUALLY PROTECT THE 
REGUIGEES IN THE CAMPS AND THE HUMANITARIAN WORKERS AT WORK 
IN THE CAMPS.  SECOND, IF SUCCESSFUL, IT WILL PROVIDE CHAD 
WITH A REFORMED, IMPROVED, AND PROFESSIONALIZED SECURITY 
FORCE LESS PERVIOUS TO CORRUPTION, ABUSES, IMPUNITY, ETC. 
THIS WOULD BE A REAL ACCOMPLISHMENT. 
 
-- THE MANDATE OF MINURCAT II SHOULD PERMIT THE EXPANSION OF 
THE DIS TO 1,700 OR MORE. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) WE NOTE THAT THE POLICE/GENDARME TRAINING ELEMENT 
IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THE TRUST FUND, RATHER THAN PKO 
FUNDS.  THIS CONSIDERATION SHOULD INFORM USG THINKING ON THE 
OVERALL RESOURCES NEEDED FOR A SUCCESSFUL MINURCAT II.
