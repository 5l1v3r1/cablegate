Hanoi, April 7, 2006 
 
The Ministry of Trade of the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam presents its compliments to the Embassy of 
the United States of America in Hanoi and, with 
reference to the Latter's Note No. 0242/06 dated 
03/16/2006, has the honor to state as follows: 
 
During the Iraq Oil-for-food Programme of the United 
Nations, the Vietnamese Government has had no 
intervention in the activities of Vietnamese 
enterprises participating in this Programme.  These 
enterprises shall be liable for their own business 
activities.  Their contracts have been approved by 
the 661 Committee of the United Nations.  These 
enterprises informed that they have complied with 
provisions of their approved contracts.  Should the 
Independent Inquiry Committee into the Oil-for-food 
Programme of the United Nations have concrete proof 
of violation of Vietnamese enterprises, the 
Vietnamese Government is willing to cooperate to 
make clear these cases. 
 
The Ministry of Trade of the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam avails itself of this opportunity to renew 
to the Embassy of the United States in Hanoi the 
assurances of its highest consideration.
