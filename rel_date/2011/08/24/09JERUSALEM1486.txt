SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (08/21): Palestinians await new US 
peace plan

Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
All front pages lead with news that US Special Envoy George Mitchell 
is finalizing the peace plan that the US will unveil early next 
month. The reports note that President Barack Obama telephoned 
Jordanian King Abdullah on August 20 to say that the US wants to see 
the Palestinians and Israelis pursue peace talks as soon as 
possible. Obama urged the Palestinians, Israelis and Arab states to 
take positive steps to support this process, according to coverage. 
White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs is quoted in the local press 
saying that "President Obama announced that George Mitchell will be 
meeting with both parties during the next weeks to discuss the 
measures that the Israelis and Palestinians have to take on in order 
to lay the foundations for the peace talks." 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Quds front page news that the US State 
Department complained to the Government of Israel about the new 
travel restrictions imposed on US citizens travelling to the West 
Bank and Israel. The reports note that the State Department is 
awaiting clarification concerning these measures before any future 
steps are taken. The report also quotes State Department Spokesman 
Ian Kelley noting that the US expects all American citizens to be 
treated equally regardless of their national origin. 
 
The local press highlights the tensions inside the Israeli 
government after the August 19 statement by Israeli Minister of 
Strategic Affairs and Vice Premier Moshe Yaalon in which he 
criticized the Peace Now movement - calling it a "virus" - and 
stressed that settlement construction will continue despite US 
pressure. The reports note that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu is seeking clarification from Yaalon. 
 
Al-Quds front pages a report on an opinion poll that was carried out 
jointly by an Israeli-Palestinian polling center on US policy in the 
Middle East. 64% of the Palestinians polled believe that President 
Obama's policy is biased towards Israel, while 45% of the Israelis 
polled believe that Israel must respond positively to US pressure in 
order to pursue the peace process.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Samih Shbeib opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "Prospects of the Palestinian Dialogue" (08/21): "I totally 
believe that if Hamas and Fatah want to end the internal division 
and support the national unity dialogue, they can do so immediately. 
However, regional powers are not yet ready for such a 
reconciliation. This is what is obstructing and will continue to 
obstruct the Palestinian dialogue." 
 
2) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title 
"Endless arguments about settlements?" (08/21): "The continuous 
argument inside the Israeli government concerning the halt of 
settlement activity is ridiculous and has become a vicious cycle. 
None of the Israelis want to see a freeze in settlement 
construction, so they propose different formulas ... We hope that 
President Obama's anticipated peace plan will undermine the Israeli 
plans and will meet our [Palestinian] expectations."
