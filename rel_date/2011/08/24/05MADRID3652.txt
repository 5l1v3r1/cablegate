SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR EU MEMBER STATES TO SUPPORT US WTO AG 
PROPOSAL -- SPAIN 
 
REF: STATE 190730 
 
 Â¶1.  Post made reftel demarche points to Alicia Villaruiz, 
Director for International Affairs at the Ministry of 
Agriculture on October 17.  Ms. Villaruiz responded with the 
following points: 
 
 -- In Spain's view, the EU has already reformed its 
agricultural practices far more than any other WTO member, 
and as a result, it is time for other WTO members to increase 
their offers in the Doha negotiations; 
 
 -- Spanish farmers are struggling with the current CAP 
reforms and are not inclined to take on additional reforms 
during the implementation period that may be associated with 
a Doha agreement; 
 
 -- Market access is a big concern -- Spain does not believe 
the EU can afford to go further in this area; 
 
 -- Spain does not see that other WTO members have done 
enough to eliminate export subsidies.  In particular, the 
Spanish believe the United States must reform its food 
assistance program as an integral part of the Doha 
negotiating round to eliminate export subsidies; and 
 
 -- All this being said, the Spanish remain optimistic that 
compromise can be reached -- but maybe not by the next 
Ministerial.
