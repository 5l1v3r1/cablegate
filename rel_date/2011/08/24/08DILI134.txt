SUBJECT: DEMARCHE TO TIMOR-LESTE ON IRAN SANCTIONS REPORT 
 
REF: State 48615 
 
Per reftel, DCM delivered demarche on May 9 on compliance with 
UNSCR 1803 to Vicky Tchong, Secretary General of Timor-Leste's 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Noting that we had submitted our 
report on May 2, we shared a copy with our report.  Ms. Tchong 
undertook to share it with Foreign Minister Da Costa, saying 
that it is extremely unlikely that Timor-Leste has any relevant 
information to report.
