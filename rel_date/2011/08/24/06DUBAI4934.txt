REF: A. DUBAI 04933, B. DUBAI 04511 
 
1.(U) SUMMARY: Demonstrators gathered near the US Consulate 
General in Dubai during the evening of July 30 to express their 
support of Lebanon and to condemn Israel and the United States. 
The demonstrators were vociferous, but there were no reports of 
violence. An earlier demonstration in support of Lebanon was 
held near the Lebanese consulate in Dubai. End Summary. 
 
2.(SBU) At 2000 hours on July 30, demonstrators began arriving 
in cars near the Dubai World Trade Center to stage a protest 
against US support for Israel's actions in Lebanon. An estimated 
crowd of 120 people had gathered by 2030. Demonstrators were 
said to be shouting in Arabic, but there was no violence or 
provocative action taken. The Dubai Police sent additional 
police to the area (ref A).  A consulate employee saw a crowd 
beginning to gather a little after 2000 and he could not 
distinguish any Emirati national participants. Those he saw wore 
western attire. 
 
3.(U) The local Arabic and English language papers reported on a 
demonstration that was held earlier in the day near the Lebanese 
consulate in Dubai. The crowd, though mostly Lebanese, included 
Emiratis and Americans. The press reported that more than 100 
people demonstrated. The Lebanese consulate was the scene of 
another gathering on July 15.  The consulate is located in 
Dubai's consulate district near Dubai Creek (ref B). 
 
4.(U) Dr. Mouza Ghobash, a UAE national who is president of the 
Ousha bint Hussain Cultural Center and a former professor of 
sociology at the UAE University in Al-Ain, was quoted in the 
Arabic language newspaper Al-Bayan as calling for Arab countries 
to close US and Israeli diplomatic missions and to recall their 
ambassadors from Israel. Dr. Ghobash was quoted in the English 
language Gulf News as asking journalists "to portray the reality 
as it is, so everyone can witness the cruelty of this enemy."
