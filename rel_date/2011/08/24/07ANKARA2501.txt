SUBJECT: ANKARA MEDIA REACTION REPORT 
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2007 
 
In Today's Papers 
 
Fifteen Soldiers Killed in PKK Attacks; Cross-Border Operation Back 
on the Agenda 
All papers devote significant space to reporting on the deaths of 15 
soldiers killed in two separate incidents in Sirnak and Diyarbakir 
within 24 hours on Sunday and Monday. The Council of Ministers 
convened on Monday and then President Gul, PM Erdogan and TGS Chief 
General Buyukanit held a special security meeting held at the 
Presidential Palace.  Responding to questions after the cabinet 
meeting on a possible cross-border operation, government spokesman 
Cemil Cicek said "our government is determined to do whatever it 
takes."  The Anti-Terror Supreme Board convened today to focus on 
concrete measures against the PKK as reactions against PKK terrorism 
increased across the country.  CHP leader Deniz Baykal denounced 
terrorism and criticized the government for not having an effective 
anti-terrorism policy.  MHP leader Devlet Bahceli also criticized 
the government and saying "launching a cross-border operation became 
a legitimate option."  DTP, for the first time, condemned the 
attack, calling the victims "martyrs" and "our children." 
 
Meanwhile, in a TV interview, Turkey's former special envoy for 
countering terrorism retired General Edip Baser criticized the US 
and EU countries for not taking necessary measures against the PKK 
and said "if a country is not taking measures it can to help a 
friendly country in its fight against terrorism, it means that 
country is supporting terrorism and it is a terrorist state itself. 
Meanwhile, all papers report that the US stance against Turkey's 
launching a cross-border operation to Northern Iraq has not changed, 
reporting that in an interview with CNN-Turk, US Ambassador Ross 
Wilson said "our view on this issue has not changed. Security steps 
can be discussed among the US, Turkey and Iraq." 
 
Commentary: PKK terror/Iraq/US 
Gungor Mengi wrote in the mainstream daily Vatan: "Turkey has failed 
to emerge as a power against terrorism.  The government didn't do 
anything about the EU's efforts to legitimize terrorists, nor did 
they give strong enough messages to the imprisoned PKK leader 
[Ocalan] so that he realizes he is being held responsible for the 
ongoing PKK attacks.  It is ironic that now Erdogan talks about new 
methods, whatever they could be at this point.  The grave mistake is 
that this government did not make it clear in the strongest possible 
way to northern Iraqi [Kurdish] leaders that there will be a price 
to pay by sheltering murderers.  PM Erdogan also talks about raising 
this issue with Bush, as if he, Bush, does not know about the issue 
[implying the US is behind the Iraqi Kurdish leaders allowing the 
terror to continue].  What we need is to unite against terrorism and 
to get rid of the insecure attitude in diplomacy.  We are very late 
in shaping a state policy on the fight against terrorism." 
 
Mainstream daily Milliyet carried this editorial on page one: "The 
ruling AKP should formulate a new strategy to cope with terrorism 
and make it a vital priority.  Foreign policy is one of the most 
valuable tools for the new strategy.  The chieftains of the PKK have 
stationed themselves in Northern Iraq with the highest protection of 
Talabani and Barzani.  The US, Turkey's ally, is only watching the 
activities of the PKK in Northern Iraq, and is preventing Turkey 
from going ahead with military action.  If a country watches 
terrorism and does not use its capacity to prevent it, it can only 
be called an accomplice to terror.  The ruling AKP failed to pursue 
diplomacy to activate the US in this regard.  The upcoming 
Congressional Armenian genocide resolution is just about to be added 
to the Northern Iraq issue.  The Turkish government should take 
every action to have the US feel that both inaction against the PKK 
and action on the AGR will undermine US interests." 
 
Turkey's Last-Minute Efforts to Prevent Armenian Resolution 
Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet, Turkiye, Zaman and others:  A 
parliamentary delegation led by AKP Istanbul deputy Egemen Bagis 
went to the US to lobby against the Armenian Genocide Resolution 
 
ANKARA 00002501  002 OF 002 
 
 
(AGR).  Prior to their departure, Bagis said, "The resolution should 
not be issued by the US House Foreign Relations Committee.  We will 
exert every effort to prevent the bill from passing.  We have 
several options and will decide on what to do if the bill is 
adopted." 
 
Meanwhile, US Ambassador Ross Wilson, in an interview with CNN-Turk, 
said that "the US Administration and President Bush have been 
exerting efforts to prevent issuance of the resolution.  No matter 
what the result is, it is to the benefit of both countries to 
cooperate."  In response to Bagis' remarks regarding Turkey cutting 
off logistic support to the US in Iraq, Ambassador Wilson said if 
that support were not also to the advantage of Turkey, it would not 
be in place, adding "Turkey needs a successful Iraq, as well" 
 
Abbas Invites Turkey to the Middle East Summit 
Sabah, Zaman and others:  During his continuing Middle East tour, 
Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan held meetings with Palestinian 
leader Abbas yesterday.  Abbas said that Palestine will continue to 
hold consultations with Turkey and said that Turkey should join the 
US-backed Middle East peace summit to be held in November. 
Meanwhile, mainstream Sabah reported that President Gul is planning 
to bring Syria's Esad, Israel's Peres and Palestine's Abbas together 
in Ankara in the upcoming weeks, prior to the summit.
