Al-Quds leads with news of an upcoming meeting to discuss 
intra-Palestinian dialogue between Egyptian Intelligence Chief 
Sulayman and a delegation of members from the Democratic Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine and Palestinian Popular Struggle Front

wire service DPA in reporting on Hamas leader Ismail Radwan's 
refusal, in a September 1 Gaza press conference, to deny or confirm

there are Egyptian efforts underway to arrange a meeting between 
Fatah and Hamas members in Cairo in October. 
 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas would win new presidential 
elections according to poll results showcased on Al Quds' front page 
and an inside page of Al-Ayyam.  The poll conducted by the 
Palestinian Center for Political and Survey Research on August 28 to 
August 30 shows that 53% of respondents in the West Bank and the 
Gaza would vote for Abbas and 39% would vote for Hamas leader Ismail 
Haniyyah if new elections were held today. 
 
Al-Quds reports on its front page that Jordanian King Abdullah II 
said in a recent interview with French weekly "L'Express" that he is 
unconvinced that Israel is interested in solving the Arab-Israeli 
conflict.  The report characterized the comment as an "unusual" 
attack by Abdullah on Israeli policy. 
 
The severe injuring of a Palestinian by Israeli soldiers in Ni'lin 
village near Ramallah on September 1 is front page news in all

on September 1.  Dailies also report that two Gaza fishermen were 
injured by rockets fired from an Israeli military ship. 
 
The World Bank wants to rescue the Dead Sea, according to an

The three dailies led with a read-out of the Olmert-Abbas meeting 
held on August 31 at Olmert's Jerusalem home.  All dailies report 
that Palestinian Authority President Abbas and Israeli Premier 
Olmert agreed to continue negotiations and reach a comprehensive 
agreement by the end of this year.  The agreement would provide 
detailed solutions, not a "mere mention of good will or the 
[negotiation] principles of each side".

The top story in Al-Quds and lead pictures in all dailies 
highlighted the August 30-31 opening of the Gaza-Egypt Rafah 
crossing point.  Reporting noted that 1,500 travelers, including

Palestinians in need of urgent medical care will cross into Egypt on 
August 31. 
 
Palestinian Authority (PA) Fayyad's call for forming a transitional 
PA government as the "logical" way to "reunite the homeland" 
received highlighted coverage in all dailies.  Leading with the 
story, Al-Ayyam quoted Fayyad reiterating the PA's "readiness" to 
manage the Gaza Strip crossings immediately in accordance with the 
Agreement on Movement and Access signed with Israel in 2005.  In 
related developments, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida highlighted that the 
deployment of Arab forces in Gaza is supported by Egypt, but fully 
rejected by Hamas. 
 
Israeli authorities intend to expand the Jerusalem area Giv'on 
Hadasha settlement by confiscating 25 acres of land belonging to the 
Palestinian town of Beit Ijza, the front pages reported.  Quoting 
Hatem Abdul Qader, advisor to Palestinian Authority President Abbas 
on Jerusalem affairs, Al-Ayyam reported that three Jerusalemite 
families will file a petition in the Israeli court system to prevent 
the confiscation of their land. 
 
Al-Ayyam's and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's front-pages reported that

of illegal possession of weapons, according to the same reports.

President Abbas in a recent interview with Al-Arabiyya, explaining 
that Secretary Rice informed the Israelis and Palestinians on her 
last visit, that the "occupied West Bank" includes East Jerusalem, 
the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea.  Abbas added that the Israelis 
"did not object" to Rice's position.  In related negotiations 
coverage, Al-Ayyam quoted PLO negotiator Saeb Erakat refuting 
reports that an agreement can be reached with the Israelis by

between the two sides' positions on all final-status issues.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs an editorial by Gaza political 
scientist Dr. Naji Sadiq Sharab, entitled, "Whither the [Internal] 
Division..." (9/02): "[T]his internal division [between Fatah and 
Hamas]...will mean the disappearance of the possibility of 
establishing a Palestinian state ... it strips the main issues of 
their political meaning and human rights implications.  For example, 
there is no need to talk about Jerusalem as a political capital. 
Instead, [the discussion will] focus on its religious and spiritual 
importance.  Everybody is forgetting about the importance of its 
borders and geographic definition ...this [internal] division could 
also be dangerous if it means that Palestinians will no longer have 
the power to determine their [political] options ..." 
¶2.  Al-Ayyam runs an editorial by regular columnist Hasan Asfour 
entitled, "Hamas' Refusal of Arab Forces..." (9/02): "[H]amas' 
refusal to study the idea of Arab forces [in the Gaza Strip] is a 
refusal to end the [internal] division and instead keep Gaza as a 
bargaining chip for the future... Hamas' position [on Arab forces] 
is an indicator of its seriousness about national dialogue..."
