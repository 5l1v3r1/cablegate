REF: SECSTATE 157039 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On 21 November, Pol-Econ Chief met with Islam Lauka, the 
Director General for Multilateral Affairs at the MFA to deliver 
reftel demarche.  Lauka said Albania's IAEA Board Member Ferit Hoxha 
had spoken to USIAEA Ambassador Schulte and Albania planned to 
support the U.S. and EU position.  Albania was waiting for a formal 
EU statement and planned to associate with that message.  In the 
absence of an EU message, Albania was prepared to make a strong 
national statement along the lines of the U.S. demarche. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Lauka confided that Albania hoped for Iran's support for 
eventual Kosovo independence within the Organization of Islamic 
Conference (OIC), and was concerned that if Albania voted against 
Iran at the IAEA that Iran would vote against Kosovo in the OIC. 
Nonetheless, Lauka said Albania agreed that the issue before the 
IAEA was more important and would support the US/EU position against 
Iran. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Albania continues to prove a valuable partner in 
issues of international consequence, and their position on the IAEA 
Board of Governors should continue to benefit the U.S.  Kosovo 
remains at the forefront of Albania's foreign policy decisions, and 
Lauka's linking of Kosovo to the IAEA issue serves as a reminder of 
this.
