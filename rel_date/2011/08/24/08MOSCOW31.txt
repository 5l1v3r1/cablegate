SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: COMPLETED PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 05-050075752 
 
REF: STATE 163875 
 
¶1.  (U) Reftel requested a pre-license end-use check to confirm the 
bona fides of Okhotnik I Rybolov, the foreign end-user and the 
foreign consignee listed on application 05-050075752.  The 
commodities in question are 32 HS Precision Pro 2000 Bolt Action 
Rifles, Caliber .300-146 valued at USD 73,600.00. 
 
¶2.  (U) On December 28, we visited the headquarters of Okhotnik I 
Rybolov located at Novopodmoskovny Pereulok 4/1, 125130 Moscow, 
Russia.  The team met with Vladimir Shchigorets, one of two owners 
of the company, and the company's General Director Mikhail 
Andreyev. 
 
¶3.  (U) Okhotnik I Rybolov has supporting documentation for the 
transaction, including licenses for importation and resale of the 
weapons. 
 
¶4.  (U) Okhotnik I Rybolov has a license to sell its products only 
from its store, Zveroboy Gun and Rifle Shop, located at ulitsa 
Mikluho-Maklaya 18/1, 117437 Moscow, Russia.  It sells primarily to 
private customers living in the Moscow region, but also has the 
proper license needed to sell to its goods to stores in all regions 
of the Russian Federation.  The specific end-use of the rifles 
mentioned in Case 05-050075752 is retail sale. 
 
¶5.  (U) Okhotnik I Rybolov was established in 2004, and has been 
importing and selling weapons since that time.  It is 100 percent 
owned by Andrey Bredikhin and Vladimir Shchigorets, both citizens of 
the Russian Federation. 
 
¶6.  (U) Okhotnik I Rybolov keeps proper records of all transactions 
and stores them in secure locations. 
 
¶7.  (U) Okhotnik I Rybolov is aware of all restrictions and 
regulations on the U.S. Munitions List and other export control 
prohibitions. 
 
¶8.  (U) Prior to resale, Okhotnik I Rybolov stores its weapons in 
vaults located in the store.  The vaults are located behind a locked 
door and a metal cage.  Display cases are behind bullet-proof glass. 
 The retail area of the store and the vaults are monitored 24 hours 
per day by video cameras.  The premises also have alarm systems 
connected to the local police department.  The local police respond 
to alarms within three to five minutes. (Note:  The local police 
department is fined if it does not respond to an alarm at the 
Zveroboy Gun and Rifle Shop within five minutes.) 
 
¶9.  (U) Post confirms the bona fides of Okhotnik I Rybolov as a 
reliable end-user and foreign consignee of the rifles as mentioned 
in Case 05-050075752.
