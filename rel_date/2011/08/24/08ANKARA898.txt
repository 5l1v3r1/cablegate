REF: STATE 45792 
 
Â¶1. (U) To commemorate May 21 Day of Solidarity with the Cuban 
People, post plans to feature on our website the Department's 
statement on solidarity with the Cuban people, and 
appropriate background information.  Additionally, two post 
political officers who previously served at USINT Havana plan 
to highlight the historic and continuing human rights abuses 
of the Cuban regime during meetings with Turkish human rights 
activists and NGOs. Turkey's current intense preoccupation 
with internal political tensions and terrorist activities is 
likely to minimize the effect of other initiatives at this 
time.
