REF: STATE 3595 
 
¶1.  Poland does not officially have a counterpart to the 
Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan/Pakistan, but 
Ambassador Jerzy Wieclaw of the MFA's Asia-Pacific Department 
would be a rough equivalent.  Ambassador Wieclaw would very 
much like to take part in the Deputy SRAP meeting, and asked 
that details concerning the time and venue of the meeting be 
passed to POC Counselor Jolanta Wojcik-Niedzielska at the 
Polish Embassy in Prague.  Wieclaw will take part in a panel 
discussion in Prague and then accompany his Minister to the 
London Conference January 28. 
 
¶2.  In addition to Wieclaw, Poland will be represented at the 
PRT conference by Ambassador Andrzej Braiter of the MFA 
Development Cooperation Department, and COL Andrzej Dylong of 
the Ministry of National Defense (and former member of the 
Ghazni PRT).  Post is coordinating with MFA to determine 
whether NGO representatives will be able to attend the 
conference.
