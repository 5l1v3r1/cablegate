this license.

Nontransfer and Use Certificates (DSP-83) that were submitted 
with the application. 
 
¶4.  Action Rabat:  Post should make appropriate inquiries to 
verify the bona fides of foreign intermediate consignee

transaction, and confirm that the Moroccan Ministry of 
Defense, Army Signal Corps ordered the exact type and 
quantity of United States Munitions List (USML) items listed

suggested guidance: 
 
For the Moroccan Ministry of Defense, Army Signal Corps: 
 
--Are you familiar with TCSM? 
 
--Did you order from TCSM the exact type and quantity of 
items listed on this application? 
 
-- If Moroccan Ministry of Defense, Army Signal Corps or 
Direction of Reception and Transit signed and dated a 
U.S. Department of State Nontransfer and Use Certificate, 
please provide a copy of that document which verifies the 
quantity 
and value of the defense articles ordered. 
 
--Is TCSM an official supplier/contractor for the Moroccan 
Ministry of Defense?  Does the Moroccan Ministry of Defense 
have 
any other contracts with TCSM? 
 
For TCSM: 
 
Department requests that Post conduct a site visit to TCSM in 
order to provide Department with an assessment of its 
business operations and on-site 
security. If a site visit is not possible, please inform 
PM/DTCC case officer. Finally, Post is asked to assess 
whether the company appears to be a reliable recipient of 
USML items. 
 
 
--Does the company have proper supporting documentation, 
including purchase orders and End use certificates from the 
Moroccan MOD, for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--Will the company be handling or storing the items listed on 
the application? If so, does it have secure facilities and 
proper accounting and security procedures for handling these 
sensitive USML items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what types of items 
does it handle; does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What types of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers 
and re-exports?
