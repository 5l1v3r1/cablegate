------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The September 16 meeting between Palestinian Authority President 
Abbas and Israeli Premier Olmert receives highlighted coverage in 
all dailies.  Front-page pictures show the two leaders shaking 
hands.  Leading with the story, Al-Quds reports that Abbas, 
"expressed disappointment," over Israel's, "failure to meet its 
commitments."  The report also quotes Palestinian negotiator Sa'eb 
Erekat noting that the meeting was held in accordance with 
understandings reached at Annapolis that any agreement must be based 
on resolving all final-status issues.  The paper notes that Israeli 
Foreign Minister Livni did not attend the meeting, citing her 
activities involving Kadima Party elections.  Coverage on Israeli 
Kadima Party elections does make the front pages, but reporting is 
not detailed nor highlighted. 
 
 
An Al-Quds' front page story quotes Palestinian negotiator Ahmad 
Quray stating that negotiations with Israel are difficult but have 
not reached the point where parties must compromise.  He explains 
that any negotiations that start with compromises cannot succeed and 
that Palestinian ambitions, "are not subject to compromise." 
 
 
Armed clashes on September 16 between Hamas and the powerful Gaza 
Daghmash clan garner prominent coverage in the dailies.  Al-Ayyam 
leads with the news, noting that clashes lasted for many hours and 
included the launching of rockets.  All papers report that 11 
people, including two children, were killed. In other Gaza news, 
Al-Quds reports that Khaled Abu Arafih, a Jerusalem resident and 
minister in the former Hamas government, was released by Israel on 
September 16, after 27-months of detention. 
 
 
Citing unidentified Israeli security sources, Al-Ayyam reports on 
its front page that the U.S., Israel and the Palestinian Authority 
(PA) are discussing a plan to replicate the security model 
implemented in Janin, in other West Bank cities.  The report states 
that, while the PA would like Hebron to be the next city, Israel 
prefers the northern border town of Tulkarm.  In related front page 
coverage, Al-Ayyam runs a story on the recent World Bank report that 
states that the Palestinian Authority has made great progress in its 
reform and development efforts and in imposing the rule of law in 
parts of the West Bank.  The report includes implied criticism of 
Israel's "limited" improvement of Palestinian freedom of movement, 
the paper notes. 
 
 
The dailies continue front-page coverage of the global financial 
crisis, running wire stories that highlight concerns over the 
possible collapse of the major U.S. insurance company AIG. 
 
 
A September 16 meeting between U.S. Commerce officials in Ramallah 
and Palestinian representatives of the IT sector gets prominent 
coverage on all dailies' economic pages.  The reports state that the 
visiting International Trade Agency desk officer and Foreign 
Commercial Service officer discussed challenges facing Palestinian 
information and communications technology infrastructure.  Separate 
articles carry coverage on the US Trade and Development Agency 
signing ceremony also held in Ramallah on September 16, in which 
USTDA awarded a local IT company a $412,093 grant to help establish 
 
JERUSALEM 00001729  002 OF 002 
 
 
the first commercial Internet data center in the West Bank.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
¶1.  Al-Quds independent writes in its main editorial entitled "Cairo 
Dialogue is an Opportunity Not to Be Wasted" (09/17): "Fatah and 
Hamas, or more precisely, the Palestinian Authority and the 
Palestinian Government in Gaza, should benefit from this [one-time] 
opportunity.  Dialogue should place the interests of Palestine and 
its people above those of the personal, party and factional 
nature... the will of the people [should be consulted since they] 
suffer from the consequences of the disputes and internal division 
that is deepening with each passing day... What we need, especially 
from Hamas, is more flexibility in dealing with the Egyptian 
proposals and what we hope to get from Egypt, is the opening of the 
Rafah crossing, because the citizens of Gaza Strip are Palestinians 
above all else, and because the majority [of Gazans] are not 
politicized, nor belong to any faction.  They want to live in 
dignity and be allowed to travel freely like people in the rest of 
the world.  The Palestinian people want a responsible, constructive 
dialogue in Cairo and are following developments closely, expecting 
positive results.  This is the message that the Palestinian people 
are sending to the leadership of Fatah and Hamas." 
 
 
¶2.  Columnist Mohammid Allush opines in official Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
under the title, "Negotiations and Resistance... New Similarities" 
(09/17): "[Palestinians]... are witnessing an unprecedented state of 
division that was further deepened by the Hamas coup in the Gaza 
Strip... It is essential that national unity be restored since our 
main confrontation should now be with Israel.  We need to mobilize 
the peoples' energy in the political, social and institutional 
arenas, and re-engage popular resistance [against] the occupation 
and its racist policies.  We need to conduct political resistance in 
all its forms, as the situation allows...  we have to strive to make 
national dialogue a success... we must look for similarities between 
the resistance and negotiations, and develop one national vision and 
one national address that places the interest of the people above 
all others."
