Post shared reftel demarche with the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.  The talking points were left with the Ministry, who 
said that they would get back to Post with any comments as soon 
as possible.  At this time, the Embassy has still not received 
word on Lesotho's position, and we do not expect to hear from 
them before the end of the day.
