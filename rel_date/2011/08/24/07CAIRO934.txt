¶2. (SBU) Description of applicant's persecution claim: Zainab Adham 
worked as an Information Resources Assistant in the Cultural Affairs 
Office of US Embassy Baghdad, starting in August 2005.  She became 
increasingly fearful moving in and out of the Green Zone as violence 
increased.  She resigned from her position in October 2006, after 
militias attacked her neighborhood, took over her house and property 
and killed a neighbor.  She was identified as an employee of the 
U.S. Embassy and was called a "traitor" and was threatened with 
death if she was found by the militias. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Zainab said her family lived in a southeast neighborhood 
in Baghdad for more than 15 years.  Between late 2005 through 2006, 
the level of violence increased in her neighborhood and she said 
that Sunni families were regularly targeted and attacked by Shia 
militias, making her increasingly fearful because she and her family 
are Sunnis.  Further, she said that while her neighbors did not know 
that both Zainab and her husband were working for the US Embassy and 
a USG-contractor, respectively, she became increasingly worried that 
this information would become known.  In August 2006, when Zainab 
was attending a US-sponsored conference in Abu Dhabi, armed militia 
(she believes it was the Shia Mahadi militia) attacked her 
neighborhood, and began shooting and killing Sunnis in the 
neighborhood.  These attacks went on for three days, and at least 
one Sunni neighbor, who lived on the same street as her family, was 
killed.  The miltias told the other neighbors that this was the 
first killing and that "all Sunni people in this street would be 
next."  Her husband, who was in their home during these attacks, 
fled with their four children, going first to his parent's house and 
then to Egypt.  He called Zainab in Abu Dhabi at the conference, 
told her what happened, and said that the armed militias had taken 
over their house.  She did not return to Baghdad and instead came to 
 
CAIRO 00000934  002 OF 002 
 
 
Egypt in September 2006 and joined her family. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  In that same month, she said that she was told by her 
friends who will still living in her old neighborhood in Baghdad 
that the militias were looking for her and her family because they 
now knew that she and her husband had been working for the United 
States.  Her neighbors told her that these militia had threatened 
her, calling her a "traitor working for the Americans," saying that 
"if we meet her we will kill her."   Her neighbors warned her not to 
return because now that the militias occupied her house, they had 
evidence that she had been working for the United States.  Her 
files, and photographs and paperwork, all of which had been hidden 
in her house, demonstrated her association with the United States. 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Justification for resettlement: Zainab is known to the US 
Embassy, where she worked for more than one year, and was an 
employee in good standing.   Refcoord met with Zainab and believes 
that she has a genuine fear of persecution because of her work with 
the US government.
