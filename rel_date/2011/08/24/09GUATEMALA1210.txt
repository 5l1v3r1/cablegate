(SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche on November 3 to Leila 
Villatoro, the MFA's Deputy Director for Multilateral Policy 
(United Nations).  Villatoro admitted that she was not familiar 
with the Goldstone Report nor with the efforts of the Arab Group, 
the OIC, and others to present a related resolution for adoption by 
the Assembly on November 4 or 5.  Villatoro said she would have to 
consult with the MFA's mission to the United Nations before she 
could say whether Guatemala is willing to join us in opposing 
possible elements in the resolution that we find objectionable.
