¶2.  (U)  Andorra continues to be a supportive partner in the 
global war on terrorism and its government has expressed 
interest in exchanging terrorist screening information pursuant 
to HSPD 6.  The government has worked to build law enforcement 
capacity, enhance border security, and combat money laundering 
and terrorist financing.  Changes from previous year's reports 
are few as no significant domestic or international-related 
terrorism occurred in the country in 2008.  The government of 
Andorra is neither a sponsor of terrorism nor does it provide 
safe haven to terrorist organizations. 
 
After September 11, 2001, the government of Andorra signed three 
conventions in the Council of Europe (Convention on the 
Suppression of Terrorism, the Criminal Law Convention on 
Corruption and the Civil Law Convention on Corruption) and two 
conventions in the United Nations (International convention on 
Suppression of the Finance of Terrorism and the Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime), all still pending 
ratification.  The government of Andorra continues to point to 
staff shortage for translations and other bureaucratic obstacles 
to ratification by Parliament.  Nonetheless, the Andorran 
government insists ratification will take place within the 
current parliamentary term. 
 
Andorra joined the GRECO (Group of States Against Corruption) on 
January 26, 2005.  Andorra is also member of Moneyval, the 
Council of Europe's group to fight money laundering.  Since 
March 2003, Andorra is a signatory to the Geneva Convention on 
the prohibition of developing, producing, storage, and use of 
chemical weapons and also on their destruction. 
 
In September 2006, the Council of Ministers approved the 
ratification of the Council of Europe's Convention on Terrorism 
prevention signed by the Andorrans in Warsaw on May 16, 2005. 
The Andorran Parliament ratified it in November 2007. 
 
The Money Laundering Prevention Unit, a governmental 
organization aimed at detecting criminal organizations in the 
Principality, works closely with the U.S. Treasury Department's 
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN) and the Egmont 
Group.  Andorra does not have a stock exchange or casinos. 
Securities and real estate are very controlled and have to 
declared as sources of income. 
 
In September 2005, a new Penal Code came into force.  The Penal 
Code's article on terrorism increased punishment for terrorist 
individuals or groups to twenty years in prison, if found 
guilty.  Penalties for money laundering and organized crime have 
also been increased. 
 
The government of Andorra cooperation with U.S. antiterrorism 
efforts is marked by efforts to combat terrorism financing and 
through adherence to international antiterrorism conventions. 
 
The Andorran government sent financial support to the Together 
Foundation aimed at helping children affected by the war in the 
former Yugoslav Republic.  The Andorran government makes a 
yearly voluntary contribution to United Nations for the Peace 
Maintenance project. 
 
No U.S. citizen has suffered kidnapping or death in the 
preceding five years and no case has arisen in Andorra requiring 
government cooperation with the U.S to prevent acts of terrorism 
against U.S. citizens in the country.
