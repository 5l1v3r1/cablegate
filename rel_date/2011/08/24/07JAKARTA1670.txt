fulfilment of UNSCR 1747 to Ramadansyah Hasan in the 
International Security and Disarmament Directorate of the 
Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs on June 8.  We 
provided a copy of the U.S. report and stressed the 
importance of submission of reports by all UN Member States. 
 
¶2. Hasan thanked us for the U.S. report and said UNSCR 1747 
was binding on all Member States.  He said Indonesia intended 
to submit a report but had not yet completed it, and 
undertook to provide a copy of the Indonesian submission once 
it became available.  He noted Indonesia had already 
submitted its report on UNSCR 1737.
