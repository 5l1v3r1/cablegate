SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN UPDATE -- DECEMBER 31 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Approximately 90 truckloads of 
humanitarian supplies entered Gaza via Kerem Shalom crossing 
on December 31.  The Gaza power plant is shut down, and Nahal 
Oz remained closed for fuel imports.  Karni crossing also 
remains closed.  Donor organizations continue to stress the 
need to open Nahal Oz and Karni, and the difficulties of 
distributing humanitarian supplies in a conflict environment. 
 End Summary. 
 
Humanitarian Supplies are Entering... 
------------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) OCHA estimated 90 truckloads of humanitarian 
supplies entered Kerem Shalom on December 31, and 90 
truckloads entered on December 30.  Both Karni and Nahal Oz 
crossings remained closed, and UN contacts report 
international agencies cannot provide enough wheat to feed 
Gazans unless Karni opens.  According to UN contacts, the 
Gaza-based "Ministry of Health" has ordered wheat wholesalers 
to bypass retailers and sell directly to the population. 
Supplies coming through Rafah increased on December 30, and 
included five ambulances from Turkey, four mobile power 
generators, and five truckloads of medical supplies.  Press 
reports an ambulance and four tons of medical supplies from 
Libya and Saudi Arabia entered through Rafah on December 31. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to OCHA, a shipment of 60 tons of 
chlorine, needed to create potable water, was refused entry 
on December 30.  Current water purification supplies are 
sufficient for approximately one week, according to UNICEF. 
 
...but Distribution is the Challenge 
------------------------------------ 
¶4. (SBU) With the resumption of shipments in recent days, 
UNRWA aims to resume food distribution (suspended since 
December 18) to 750,000 Gazans on January 1.  UNRWA reports 
current food stocks will allow for three days of 
distribution.  However, without opening Karni for massive 
wheat deliveries, UNRWA contacts say they cannot sustain food 
distribution for more than a few days.  WFP re-started its 
program on a limited basis and distributed bread in Beit 
Hanoun on December 31. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Palestinian telecommunications company Paltel 
reported to Econoff that air raids on December 27 destroyed 
its switchboard and impacted phone services essential for 
humanitarian operations.  Paltel has requested the GOI 
facilitate entry of needed telecom equipment into Gaza. 
 
Fuel and Medical Update 
----------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) WHO contacts report that the medical supplies that 
arrived on December 30 addressed many urgent needs.  However, 
they note Gaza hospitals lack laboratory chemicals, critical 
care equipment, anesthesia supplies, and surgical items.  One 
doctor told Econ Specialist that medics are operating with 
unsterilized equipment because of the shortage of surgical 
kits.  WHO contacts also report hospitals are running solely 
on backup generators, and estimate the generators will not 
last more than a week if power demands continue at current 
levels.  No fuel has entered Gaza since December 26, and 
reserve supplies are depleted. 
 
Patients Transferred to Egypt 
----------------------------- 
¶7. (SBU) Representatives of the Egyptian Consulate told 
ConGenOffs that over 50 injured have exited through Rafah 
since December 28.  He said 40 ambulances and a 
medically-equipped military plane are on standby at Rafah to 
transport evacuees to hospitals in Cairo.  OCHA reports no 
patients exited through Erez on December 31. 
 
Cash Shortage 
------------- 
¶8. (SBU) The two Israeli banks that provide correspondent 
banking services to Palestinian banks will terminate that 
relationship with Gaza branches at midnight on December 31, 
according to banking contacts.  The Palestine Monetary 
Authority (PMA) reports it will request a permit from the GOI 
to transfer cash into Gaza in order to disburse December PA 
salaries and humanitarian payments on January 5.  UNRWA has 
volunteered to provide the necessary security, including 
armored trucks, to transport cash from the crossings to the 
banks.  The PMA has agreed to work with UNRWA in this regard, 
and Embassy Tel Aviv will present the proposal to COGAT/MOD.
