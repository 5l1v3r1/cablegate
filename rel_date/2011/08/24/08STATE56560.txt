SUBJECT: FRIENDS OF IRAQ CONFERENCE PROPOSED AGENDA 
 
REF: A. STATE 50592 
 
¶1. This is an action request.  See para 3. 
 
¶2. BACKGROUND.  The Friends of Iraq Conference, hosted by 
Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), Government of Iraq (GOI), 
and U.S. Embassy Baghdad, is set for June 17-19, 2008 at the 
Armed Forces Officer Club (AFOC), Abu Dhabi, United Arab 
Emirates (Ref A).  The focus of discussions for this 
conference expands beyond the security theme of previous Iraq 
Coalition Conferences.  The non-security focus of the Friends 
of Iraq Conference has generated considerable interest from 
invited Nations outside of the current membership of MNF-I 
coalition and NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) partners. 
To further encourage interest in the Economic and Governance 
discussions, the proposed conference agenda is provided for 
Embassy conveyance to prospective participants.  This 
conference provides an opportunity to discuss how to 
collectively build on the gains achieved in Iraq and to 
discuss current and emerging needs and coalition 
opportunities.  END BACKGROUND. 
 
¶3. ACTION REQUEST.  Posts are requested to convey the 
following proposed agenda in para 4 and draft U.S. 
participants list in para 5 as soon as possible.  For Embassy
