¶1. (SBU) On February 26, representatives of more than 40 
religious denominations and ethnic communities from the Odesa 
oblast signed a joint statement condemning the February 17-18 
desecration in Odesa of Holocaust memorials, a Jewish 
cemetery, and a memorial to a well-known Odesan Jew (reftel). 
The vandalism had been immediately condemned by Odesa Mayor 
Eduard Hurvits, who is Jewish himself, the Odesan police, and 
the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and investigations 
were quickly launched.  The spokesman for the Jewish 
community center in Odesa city told us on February 27 that a 
task force of local and national law enforcement officials 
has identified suspects, but no arrests have been made. 
 
¶2. (U) The statement, produced at a joint session of the 
Coordinating and Consultative Council on Religious-Secular 
Accord and Council of Ethnic Communities, lamented a lack of 
historical awareness of the Holocaust on the part of the 
younger generation and called on the government to do 
everything possible to bring the vandals to justice.  It said 
that the vandalism was "a well-planned provocation rather 
than a spontaneous action committed by a marginal part of 
society," and that the attempt to spark anti-Semitism was 
part of "a political struggle."  A rabbi at the session said 
that if the authorities did not react properly to the 
provocation, it could encourage similar acts against other 
ethnic and religious groups.  City Council Secretary 
Prokopenko described the vandalism as: "a deep psychological 
trauma for the citizens of Odesa.  This is our common 
pain...it is directed against all ethnic groups.  We have to 
do everything possible to ensure this does not happen again." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: It is reassuring to see that in a city that 
prides itself on its diversity and history of multiculturism, 
the citizenry publicly rejects such hostile acts and condemns 
anti-Semitism.  Signatories included 19 religious 
denominations, including all major Orthodox, Protestant and 
Catholic churches in Ukraine in addition to Jewish 
communities, as well as 23 various ethnic communities, 
including Roma.
