FARMER DISCONTENT 
 
¶1. Summary:  Following large-scale farmer demonstrations throughout 
France on November 7, the French Minister of Agriculture proposed a 
250 million euro financial assistance package for the French farm 
sector. The package encompasses a wide range of programs, including 
direct payments to the French sheep industry, tax rebates and 
incentives to lower energy consumption on farms. Initial farm-sector 
reactions were less than enthusiastic particularly in view of the 
credit crunch in conjunction with generally lower farm prices. End 
summary. 
 
¶2. FNSEA, the main French farm union, initiated widespread 
demonstrations and blockades across France on November 7th to 
protest rising production costs and falling revenues. More than 
10,000 farmers participated in the demonstrations. 
 
¶3. The Ministry of Agriculture projects that the average French 
farmer's income will drop by 8 to 15 percent in 2008, driven by 
higher production costs and lower or stable farm commodity prices. 
Since 2006, energy prices have risen by 30 percent, fertilizer 
prices by 25 percent and feed prices by 15 percent; grain and 
oilseed prices have dropped by 20 percent while animal product 
prices have remained stable or seen marginal increases, and fruits 
and vegetable prices have risen but on smaller harvests. 
 
¶4.  In 2008, the revenue for grain farmers is expected to fall 25 to 
35 percent (still 10 percent higher than in 1997, due to sharp price 
hikes in 2007); fruit farmers' income will continue to decline (10 
percent lower following a 20 percent decline in 2007); and cattle 
farmers will lose 20 to 30 percent of their income. Sheep farmers 
will be the hardest hit, with income projected at 30 percent below 
the average for French farmers. On the other hand, poultry and pork 
farmers will have stable or higher income in 2008, driven by higher 
commodity prices. 
 
¶5. The Ministry of Agriculture (MinAg) financial assistance proposal 
targets the bulk of its measures at the vulnerable sheep industry. 
While implementation details remain scarce, the intention is to 
provide 25 million Euros from its unused EU direct payments 
portfolio, supplemented with 25 million Euros from the French 
budget, to augment sheep farmers' income which has been negatively 
impacted by falling prices and Blue Tongue Disease. The MinAg is 
keen to support the sheep industry because sheep are primarily 
raised in sparsely populated, rural areas, where the Ministry does 
not want to lose farmers. 
 
¶6. Other producers will be eligible for a variety of benefits, 
including, social security tax rebates, favorable government 
subsidized loan rates at private banks, and beginning farmers will 
have their social tax exemption extended for an additional year. 
The projected total cost for these measures is 79 million Euros. 
 
¶7. The MinAg further guaranteed that farmers will continue to 
benefit from a partial excise tax reduction on energy (namely diesel 
oil) and added a new program to pay for up to 10,000 on-farm audits 
to propose energy saving techniques. The government will also 
subsidize energy saving investments and equipment which produce 
on-farm energy, such as solar heating. Total cost for these measures 
is estimated at 75 million Euros. 
 
¶8. Initial farmer reaction to the MinAg proposals was not 
enthusiastic. Sheep farmers, who continue to demonstrate, are 
demanding an additional 160 million Euros and a doubling of the EU 
ewe premium to 27 euro per head. FNSEA, the main French farmers 
union responded that the MinAg proposal was well below their 
expectations. 
 
¶9. Note: due to the global financial crisis, arable crop farmers who 
benefitted from higher commodity prices and incomes in 2007, and who 
used these profits to purchase new equipment, are finding it 
difficult to meet these payments and to obtain short term credit for 
daily operations. We expect farmer discontent related to financial 
pressures to continue in the coming months.
