 ¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel request, Pol Off met with 
Mohamed Fathallah of the Fathallah Arms Company at his Cairo 
retail store on December 16.  Fathallah confirmed that he 
received all of the weapons listed on the licenses 050073373 
and 050120640 from RSR Group of Winterpark, Florida. 
Fathallah did not have the sales records available during the 
meeting, but he subsequently provided the names of the buyers 
for all the weapons sold (approximately 25 percent of the 
total shipment).  According to the list he provided, the 
weapon bearing serial number BJM3308 was sold to a Colonel 
Ahmed Saleh el Sayed Ahmed.  Fathallah promised to provide 
copies of the monthly reports he sends to the Ministry of 
Interior, which lists the details of each sale. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Fathallah said that he imports between $100,000 and 
$120,000 worth of U.S. weapons every year.  His only U.S. 
supplier is the RSR Group.  He only sells weapons to 
individuals that have a valid weapons license issued by the 
Ministry of Interior and does not sell weapons outside of 
Egypt.  Fathallah does sell weapons to other dealers, but 
could not say if those dealers have clients outside Egypt. 
Fathallah operates two retail stores in Alexandria and Cairo. 
 The Alexandria store has been operated by the Fathallah 
family for over 100 years. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) He said he was familiar with U.S. restrictions on 
the re-export of weapons, noting that U.S. and Italian 
restrictions were the tightest, while German and Turkish 
regulations were not as strict.  Fathallah said that his 
profit margin for U.S. manufactured weapons was high.  For 
example, he said he purchases a Smith and Wesson 9V gun from 
the U.S. dealer for $600, then sells it in Egypt for $4000, 
which includes a 40 percent import tax and a 10 percent sales 
tax.  He said he does not order a larger quantity of U.S. 
weapons because the process from ordering to delivery can 
take up to one year. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Post will continue to follow up with Mr. Fathallah 
and provide details of each weapon sold once received.
