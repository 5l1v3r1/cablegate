SUBJECT: AT LONG LAST CHINESE AND BANGLADESHI UNITS DEPLOY 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Despite a 24-hour delay from their projected January 20 
deployment date, the Chinese engineering unit and the 
Bangladeshi-formed police unit (FPU) of the United Nations Heavy 
Support Package (HSP) of assistance to the African Union Mission in 
the Sudan finally left their base in Nyala to begin their respective 
work in the field.  Their deployment was delayed due to the visit by 
UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations Assistant-Secretary-General 
(A/SYG) Jane Holl Lute, who was in South Darfur the same day to 
assess deployment progress. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to a January 21 UNAMID briefing in El Fasher, 
both units and their Nigerian force protection have complete food 
rations and bedding and have deployed to the "Green Field," where 
the units will spend the next nine days constructing their own 
accommodations [NOTE: According to UNAMID Deputy Chief of Integrated 
Support Services (CISS), the units will continue to overnight in the 
PAE Forward Operating Base in Nyala until their lodging and latrines 
at the new location are completed. END NOTE]. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Despite a 48-hour delay on issuance of the Fragmentation 
Order authorizing the units' deployment and A/SYG's unintended 
delay, the units have not encountered major problems.  Initial 
reports of an absence of Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) for the 
Nigerian battalion to escort the units proved untrue.  The Deputy 
CISS told FieldOff that the APCs are insured and now bear UN number 
plates (the initial absence of which had caused a slight delay).  40 
containers of necessary supplies are due to arrive within the next 
two to three days, according to the Deputy CISS.  He went on to 
dismiss reports that the Bangladeshi FPU was having a problem with 
the drinking water at the Green Field, confirming that the FPU had a 
30-day supply of bottled water.  The only potential complication 
raised by the Deputy CISS was uncertainty as to whether or not armed 
forces in the area - including the Government of Sudan and rebel 
movements - had been adequately informed of the units' deployment. 
He noted, however, that there had been no problems reported by any 
side in the run-up to deployment. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Given the early January attack on the UN convoy 
near Tine, West Darfur, UNAMID planners are taking additional 
measures to inform GOS and rebel sector commanders of their 
movements and deployments. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Tripoli minimize considered.
