¶4.  Health safety: Information on vaccinations and other

1-800-232-3299; or via the Internet at http://www.cdc.gov. 
 
¶5.  Security Assessment: In the aftermath of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom (OIF) there continues to be the potential for both 
transnational and indigenous terrorist groups to target U.S. 
interests in Turkey.  After the Gulf War, the predecessor to 
the Turkish Terrorist Group Revolutionary People,s 
Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C) assassinated four Americans 
in Turkey and carried out numerous bombings of U.S. targets 
(mostly private sector businesses, although two rockets were 
directed toward the Consulate General in Istanbul). 
Subsequent to the ending of OIF hostilities, there have been 
isolated terrorist bombings attributed to DHKP/C and other 
indigenous terrorist groups in protest of OIF.  Other Turkish 
terrorist groups with anti-Western sympathies include 
Marxist-Leninist Communist Party (MLKP) Turkish Communist 
Party/Marxist Leninist (TKP/ML), Turkish Workers and Peasants 
Revolutionary Army (TIKKO) and Islamic Greater Eastern 
Raiders/Front (IBDA/C).  Al-Qa,ida threats to target U.S. 
bases in Turkey have been public knowledge for some time. 
 
¶6. The Turkish National Police (TNP) is quite responsive in 
their role as protector of U.S. diplomatic and military 
interests in Turkey.  The TNP has provided enhanced coverage 
at each of our facilities in Ankara, Istanbul, Adana and 
Izmir.  Mission Turkey is confident the TNP will continue 
their high level of responsiveness for U.S. facilities.  The 
incidence of crime, both violent and the more traditional 
tourist crimes (pick pocketing, purse-snatching, etc.), is 
relatively low throughout Turkey.  Visitors to Istanbul 
should be aware that tourist-type crimes are more prevalent 
there, especially in the traditional tourist areas, such as 
Sultanahmet and Istiklal Caddesi.  The security office 
encourages visitors to report any security incidents, 
including surveillance, to the RSO immediately.
