REF: A. SECSTATE 157021 
 
     ¶B. NEW DELHI 04668 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloffs delivered ref A demarche to MEA Director 
(United Nations Economic and Social) Dinesh Patnaik on 
November 16, urging the GOI, as a huge democracy and 
defender of human rights, to support these resolutions, or 
at least, to agree not to render no-action votes.  Patnaik 
reiterated the GOI's position that it will not support 
country-specific human rights resolutions in the UN, 
remarking that India is expected to vote for no action on 
the resolutions (ref B).  One notable exception is the 
resolution on the DPRK; Patnaik noted that India can be 
expected to abstain on this vote, because of its objections 
to the abductions of Japanese citizens committed by that 
country.  Explaining India's unwillingness to publicly 
support condemnation of Burma, Patnaik observed that the 
GOI views the human rights records of the regimes of 
Pakistan and Burma as very similar and cannot comprehend 
the divergence of U.S. policy regarding these countries.
