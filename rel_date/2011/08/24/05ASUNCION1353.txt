INCREASING EXTREMISM 
 
REF: STATE 199225 
 
On 10/28, Charge drew from reftel points in conveying to 
Acting FM Gimenez U.S. outrage over Iran's extremist 
declarations and called upon Paraguay to similarly condemn 
the Iranian President's recent statements.   Gimenez 
expressed some reluctance about Paraguay's speaking out 
publicly on this issue.  Paraguay is seeking to expand 
commercial ties with many countries in the Middle East and 
was disinclined to make statements that could dampen 
prospects for exports to the Middle East.
