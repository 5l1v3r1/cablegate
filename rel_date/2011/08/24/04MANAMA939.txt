¶4. COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST:  Obtaining National Assembly 
assent to ratify these two conventions was not easy for the 
GOB, but they achieved it despite hash criticism from some 
parliamentarians.  Post would appreciate Department's expert 
opinon on the significance of Bahrain's reservations to the 
two treaties and guidance on whether we should weigh in with 
the GOB on removing the reservations in the future.  END 
COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST.
