REFTEL: 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Task Force Helmand (TFH) is fully engaged in 
stabilization operations in Musa Qala and their Military 
Stabilization Team (MST) has identified health, education and road 
projects for immediate reconstruction.  PRT officers and GoA 
officials visited Musa Qala on Dec 16, and were briefed on 
reconstruction plans of the city.  The MST estimated 400 people are 
returning daily to the city and ANA forces said shops were reopening 
as supplies could now arrive.  The city has partial electricity and 
the Roshan tower is repaired and Musa Qala has cell coverage.  The 
PRT group spent five hours in the city and reviewed the proposed 
reconstruction sites.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Reconstruction a Priority 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) PRT leadership traveled to Musa Qala on Dec 16 with Helmand 
Ministries of Reconstruction and Rural Development (MRRD) and Health 
directors, three members of the Provincial Council and Independent 
Directorate for Local Governance (IDLG) Deputy, Akber Aferdi.  The 
group was briefed by the MST and General Muhaidan on security and 
development issues.  Muhaidan said that security situation was 
stable and three checkpoints were already under construction.  The 
MST agreed that the city was calm and they had carried out a quick 
survey of short and long term development projects.  They said some 
buildings within the city had been damaged but many were only in 
disrepair and could be ready to use quickly, this includes a school 
and several clinics. 
 
Schools and Medicine 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU).  The MST said the city high school and public clinic are 
in fairly good condition and could be repaired in a matter of weeks. 
The high school needs cleaning, painting, and furniture but the 
facility is in fair condition.  The MST is trying to locate former 
teachers and started a cash for work program to clean the facility 
and the playground.  The public medical clinic needs minor repairs 
and the MST thinks it can also be working in a few weeks.  Several 
staff members were at the clinic location and they told poloff they 
have medical supplies but more equipment and supplies are needed. 
The MST is conducting an inventory to determine what supplies and 
medical equipment are on hand.  The MST said many people are asking 
when the school and clinic would be repaired and are pleased to see 
reconstruction efforts underway. 
 
Long Term Development 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU).  The MST also reviewed several larger projects that are 
important to the next phase of stabilization.  The central Mosque 
has been totally destroyed and will need to be completely rebuilt. 
Residents told poloff the Taliban elements destroyed the Mosque some 
time ago and this did not happen during the battle.  The city 
administration building and a private clinic require major 
reconstruction and the main city road will have to be repaired.  The 
MST said several contractors are already in the city and work can 
begin on the road repair in a short time.  The larger building 
projects will require plans, local approval and site clearance 
before construction can begin. 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The residents of Musa Qala are pleased the initial 
reconstruction is underway and all said they welcome substantial 
support from ISAF and their government.  Many residents were happy 
to see Helmand officials with the PRT group and many came forward to 
voice ideas for repairing the city.  The TFH officers said they were 
surprised how quick the city recovered in just a few days and 
estimated 400 residents were returning daily.  ANA officers said 
supplies are arriving in the city and many local vendors are back 
open.  TFH's immediate reconstruction efforts have made a good 
impresson on Musa Qala residents and bought valuable time to allow 
sustained development to move forward.
