¶1. DISASTER DECLARATIONS AND REPORTS OF RECENT FLOODING IN 
NEIGHBORING MOZAMBIQUE AND MALAWI CAUSED US TO CONTACT THE 
GOZ AND DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE AND EXTENT OF COLLATERAL 
FLOOD DAMAGE IN ZIMBABWE.  NATURAL DISASTER TRACKING AND 
ASSISTANCE COORDINATION IS HANDLED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF 
CIVIL PROTECTION IN THE MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND 
NATIONAL HOUSING.  ACCORDING TO THE LATEST STATUS REPORT 
ISSUED FEBRUARY 23 BY THE CIVIL PROTECTION DEPARTMENT, THE 
CURRENT, PHYSICAL FLOOD DAMAGE IN ZIMBABWE IS MINIMAL WITH 
CROSS-BORDER DISEASE OUTBREAK (CHOLERA, DIARRHEA AND 
MALARIA) CONSTITUTING THE BIGGEST THREAT.  THE AFFECTED 
AREAS AND DAMAGE ARE: 
 
=  MANICA PROVINCE (BORDERING MOZAMBIQUE): FLOODING WITHIN 
THE HONDE VALLEY 10 KM INSIDE MOZAMBIQUE IS RISING AND COULD 
SPILL OVER INTO ZIMBABWE.  CASES OF MALARIA AND DIARRHEA 
REPORTED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER, WHICH IS VERY POROUS 
IN THIS REGION. 
 
=  MANICALAND PROVINCE: SOME LANDSLIDES OCCURRED IN THE 
FOOTHILLS EAST OF CHIMANIMANI, WITH NO REPORTED INJURIES. A 
FOOTBRIDGE OVER THE NYAHONDE RIVER, ALSO WASHED AWAY DURING 
CYLCONE ELINE LAST YEAR, WAS AGAIN WASHED AWAY.  TEA ESTATES 
REPORT THAT THEIR WORKERS ARE INCREASINGLY MAROONED IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  00829  261349Z 
MOZAMBIQUE BY THE FLOODED RUYA RIVER, AND THE ONLY SCHOOL IN 
THE AREA (OPERATED BY THE OWNERS OF THE KATIYO TEA ESTATE) 
HAS CLOSED DUE TO THE ATTENDANCE DROP. 
 
=  MASHONALAND CENTRAL: SOME CROPS, HOMESTEADS, GRANARIES 
AND TWO FOOTBRIDGES WERE AFFECTED BY FLOODING THAT HAS SINCE 
SUBSIDED.  THE DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR'S OFFICE WILL BE 
LOANED FOUR MINISTERIAL 4X4 VEHICLES TO CONDUCT SITE 
SURVEYS, AND TRUCKS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE IF RELIEF 
SUPPLIES NEED TO BE DELIVERED.  THE ZAMBEZI RIVER HAS 
OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS IN KANYEMBA (WHERE ZAMBIA, MOZAMBIQUE 
AND ZIMBABWE MEET), A BORDER CONTROL/POLICE STATION IS 
FLOODED AND ONLY ONE NURSE REMAINS AT THE LOCAL CLINIC. 
 
=  MASVINGO PROVINCE: TWO SMALL ROAD BRIDGES ON THE 
MASVINGO/BEITBRIDGE ROAD WERE WASHED AWAY BY RUNOFF FROM 
LOCAL SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS.   TRAFFIC HAS BEEN DIVERTED TO 
SECONDARY ROADS/CROSSINGS, AND MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT AND 
ARMY ENGINEERS WILL UTILIZE BAILEY BRIDGES AS A TEMPORARY 
MEASURE. 
 
¶2. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE WEEKLY STATUS REPORTS 
FROM THE CIVIL PROTECTION UNIT AND OTHER SOURCES OF 
INFORMATION, AND ADVISE WHEN AND IF FLOOD CONDITIONS WORSEN 
DURING THE TAIL-END OF THIS RAINY SEASON.  WHILE DAMAGE TO 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND DWELLINGS HAS BEEN LOW TO DATE, CROP 
DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE ERRATIC AND AT TIMES HEAVY RAINS IS AT 
PRESENT A MORE SERIOUS CONCERN.  THE IMPACT ON CROP YIELDS 
WILL TAKE TIME TO BE QUANTIFIED THOUGH IT IS ALREADY KNOWN 
THAT DRY CONDITIONS IN MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE 
COUNTRY, AND RECENT, VERY HEAVY RAINS IN MASHONALAND CENTRAL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  00829  261349Z 
HAVE DRASTICALLY REDUCED BOTH CASH AND FOOD CROP YIELDS. 
MISSION'S REGULAR FOOD REPORTING MESSAGES WILL CONTINUE TO 
ADDRESS THE TOPIC OF FOOD SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND THE NEED FOR 
IMPORTS OR RELIEF.
