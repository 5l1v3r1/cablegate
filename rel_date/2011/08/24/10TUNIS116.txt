Science Envoy Visit 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Embassy continues to plan for the March 8-9 
visit to Tunisia of U.S. Science Envoy Elias Zerhouni. 
Senior GOT officials have told the Ambassador they look 
forward to welcoming Dr. Zerhouni.  The Embassy is preparing 
a program that will include calls on senior GOT leaders, a 
visit to a new Science and Technology research park/business 
incubator, meetings with prominent Tunisian business leaders 
and scientists, and a reception hosted by the Ambassador. 
 
----------------------- 
Entrepreneurship Summit 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) As of February 16, Embassy Tunis can confirm that 
one invitee to the Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship 
has both the funding and the visa needed to assure her 
attendance.  In a recent meeting, this invitee (Ms. Zahra Ben 
Nasr from the Center for Young Entrepreneurs) expressed her 
enthusiasm to attend the Summit as both a learning experience 
and a networking opportunity.  Two other invitees are likely 
to attend:  one holds a valid visa, the other has applied and 
will likely receive a visa, and neither has approached us on 
funding.  Neither of the two remaining invitees has yet 
applied for a visa, despite our repeated reminders, and both 
have approached us for funding.  We estimate that $2,500 per 
invitee would cover airfare and per diem. 
 
--------------- 
Action Requests 
--------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Embassy requests Department guidance on the 
availability of approximately $5,000 to support the 
participation of two Tunisians at the Presidential Summit on 
Entrepreneurship. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Embassy also requests designation of Dr. Mahmoud 
Triki, Dean of the Southern Mediterranean School of Business, 
as an alternate invitee in the event any of the invitees 
designated in ref C are unable to attend the Summit.
