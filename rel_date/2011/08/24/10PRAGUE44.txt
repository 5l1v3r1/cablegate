CZECH RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 7242 
 
¶1.  (U) We delivered reftel points to Czech Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) Human Rights Department officials on 
January 26.  MFA official Petra Ali Dolakova welcomed U.S. 
participation in the UPR. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Dolakova said the MFA was preparing questions in 
advance of the February 15 session and would be willing to 
share the questions with us once they were drafted.  Dolakova 
said the questions would focus on Iran's cooperation with 
international human rights mechanisms; torture; 
discrimination; violence against women and children; 
vulnerable groups, including human rights defenders; and 
media freedom. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Dolakova said the Czech Republic will also prepare 
a statement for the Iran UPR reflecting concern with some of 
the same issues as the questions, and also mentioning 
post-election violence and persecution in Iran.
