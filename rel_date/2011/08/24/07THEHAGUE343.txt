¶1. (SBU) Both Foreign Affairs and Finance officials say the 
Dutch will not sanction additional Iranian entities until the 
EU completes negotiations over implementing regulations for 
UNSCR 1737. Huib Mijnarends, Senior Policy Officer 
responsible for sanction issues, Terrorism and New Threats 
Unit, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), told Econoff 
February 21 he had passed the nonpaper (ref A) to Dutch 
PermReps in Brussels. Mijnarends said that the EU started 
negotiating implementing regulations February 19, which would 
probably go "even further" than UNSCR 1737 in two main areas: 
first, by denying student visas to any Iranians linked to 
Iran's proliferation or WMD programs; and second, by 
providing the option for member states to suggest additional 
entities beyond those in UNSCR 1737. Since negotiations are 
ongoing, Mijnarends noted the GONL is not ready to discuss 
additions to the annex -- including those designated by the 
USG under E.O. 13382. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a February 22 conversation, Erik Ligthart, Deputy 
Director, Financial Integrity Unit, Ministry of Finance (MOF) 
confirmed Mijnarend's assessment that EU implementing 
legislation needed to be completed before the Dutch would 
consider additional entities. He added that MFA would lead 
any GONL action regarding UNSCR 1737. Ligthart also declined 
to comment on the specific entities designated in ref A, but 
said MOF would not oppose future proposals that include 
adequate identifiers -- such as date of birth and passport 
numbers -- and in the case of bulk designations, adequate 
justification (see ref B for earlier post reporting on 
identifiers).
