REF: STATE 154777 
 
¶1. EXBS Advisor called on the new Turkish Atomic Energy 
Authority (TAEK) President, Mr. Okay Cakiroglu, on August 6. 
Cakiroglu assumed these duties this past July.  EXBS Advisor 
the meeting, we raised the Cekmece Nuclear Plants (reftel), 
noting that DOE is willing to assist in the physical security 
upgrades to these facilities. 
 
¶2. Cakiroglu and his colleagues provided the following 
information in response to the questions posed in reftel: 
 
    a. What is the status of TR-2 reactor?  Has it been 
refurbished and will it be restored to full operational 
capability? 
 
The TR-2 reactor has not been started and will not be started 
in the near future.  TAEK has developed plans to refurbish 
the reactor, but does not have a timetable for either 
starting the refurbishment or an estimate of the length of 
time that it would take to complete the refurbishment. 
 
    b.  What are the plans for the TR-1?  If it is to be 
restarted what type of fuel will it use and where will the 
fuel come from? 
 
The plans for TR-1 are for its use for medical research only 
at this time.  In the near future it may also be used for 
other medical purposes, and that is the extent of use that is 
planned for this reactor.  The fuel being used at this time 
is from fuel that Turkey has on hand. Turkey has every 
intention of complying with its agreement with the US to 
return fuel, both used and unused.  While the agreement is to 
return the spent fuel rods by 2006, Turkey may also have 
unused fuel rods that it will need to return, since it is not 
expending fuel at the planned rate. 
 
    c.  Does Turkey intend to request US assistance with it 
physical protection upgrades? 
 
Turkey does not intend to request any assistance from the US. 
 Turkey has been working on the list of recommendations 
provided by IAEA in July 2003 and has remedied all noted 
deficiency in the physical protection of the facilities. 
 
¶3.  Comment: Given the low level of activity at Cekmece, 
Cakiroglu did not believe there was reason for more in-depth 
discussions with us.  We are prepared to approach him again 
if Washington believes it is necessary. End comment.
