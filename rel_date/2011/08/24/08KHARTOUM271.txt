¶1. (U) SUMMARY: There has been a storm of media interest in the 
run-up to Special Envoy Williamson's visit to Sudan.  Some papers 
echo the cautiously optimistic attitude of the Sudanese government 
that a positive outcome may result of the visit, while others cast 
the trip as "more business as usual" in the bilateral relationship. 
There is also particular interest in the timing of the Special 
Envoy's visit coinciding with that of the Chinese Special Envoy on 
Darfur.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) A press release by the Sudan News Agency (SUNA) on the visit 
has been widely circulated in the local media since it was released 
on February 22.  According to the release, Foreign Minister Deng 
Alor briefed President Bashir on his delegation's recent visit to 
Washington, describing it as "positive" and "a step towards serious 
dialogue" between Sudan and the United States.  Deng said the two 
sides were on the "right path" to resolve the following issues: 
bilateral relations, Darfur, the implementation of the Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement (CPA), and the problems faced by the Sudanese 
Embassy in Washington and the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum.  In 
addition, he said that Sudan's listing on the State Sponsors of 
Terrorism list was discussed, as was the issue of Sudanese prisoners 
at Guantanamo. 
 
¶3. (U) Adam Mohamed Adam, a columnist with the liberal Al-Sudani 
daily, wrote on February 24 that the Special Envoy is "expected to 
bring answers" to the problem issues between Sudan and the United 
States.  He described the Special Envoy as a seasoned diplomat who 
has held important positions in the USG.  Adam pointed out that the 
Williamson played key roles as the Illinois Republican Party Chief 
when the state was "rocked by a scandal during the tenure of 
Governor George Ryan."  Adams says this is good for Sudan as 
Williamson was "a peacemaker in a divided and harsh climate."  The 
author speculated whether that the Special Envoy "will have all the 
answers" or if he will instead "resign quickly." 
 
¶4. (U) In the same Al-Sudani column, Adam also wrote that "some 
analysts believe Williamson may not fare any different from Natsios" 
because "they both receive their instructions from Washington." 
Adam quoted Sudanese strategic studies expert Dr. Ibrahim Mirghani, 
as saying "the Special Envoys fail in their mission not for lack of 
initiative or ideas but because of Washington's unrelenting policies 
on Sudan."  Mirghani said President Bush ignored Sudan during his 
recent Africa visit. He said that despite Charge d'Affaires 
Fernandez's good intentions, relations between Sudan and the United 
States "have worsened." 
 
¶5. (U) Some newspapers have made an issue of the "the unprecedented 
coincidence of visits" to Sudan by the U.S. and Chinese Special 
Envoys. The pro-government, anti-West Al-Intibaha newspaper stated 
that "the government will need to choose which Envoy it prefers to 
interact with more positively."  In a first page article, the 
newspaper claims that "some Sudanese ministers have noted their 
preference toward China" because "Sudan feels it has more to gain in 
its relations with China than with the U.S."  The paper also states 
that "the issue of bilateral relations with the U.S." will 
"certainly have a prominent position" in the government's 
discussions with Special Envoy Williamson. 
 
¶6. (U) An editorial article in Khartoum's Al-Ayaam newspaper 
entitled "America and China meet today in Khartoum" was published on 
February 24.  The paper stated that both the U.S. and Chinese 
Special Envoys are expected to arrive February 24.  The editorial 
stated that "while the two envoys may not hold direct talks" with 
one another, they "do have a common interest - Darfur."  The author 
posited what the official Sudanese reaction to the visits might be 
"in light of direct pressures from the U.S." and "indirect pressures 
from China in the form of 'friendly advice.'" 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: While the media's predictions for the outcome of 
the Special Envoy's visit are mixed, on the whole they are decidedly 
more optimistic in their assessments than they were in late December 
2007 (see reftel).
