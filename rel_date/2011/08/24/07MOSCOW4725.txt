ROLE AS "GOOD OPPORTUNITY" IN BLACK SEA REGION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 132171 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche to Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation Division Second Secretary Aleksandar Fedorinov on 
September 26.  He told us that Russia sees the Black Sea 
Economic Forum as the best way to increase multilateral 
cooperation in the region, noting that some of its working 
groups deal directly with the strategic interests mentioned 
in reftel.  The ring highway of the region, Fedorinov noted 
as an example, was a GOR initiative during their 2006 
presidency and will help with the physical transport of goods 
and people.  The GOR sees economic cooperation as the best 
way to promote security, democracy, and human rights in the 
region, and Fedorinov told us that the U.S.'s increased 
participation is "a good opportunity" for practical results. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Fedorinov told us the GOR sees the completion of 
the Black Sea Energy Ring as the best way to ensure increased 
energy security in the region.  He said that coordination of 
the three different energy networks used in the region could 
be completed late this year.  While regional multilateral 
organizations are not now playing a major role in pipeline 
development, Fedorinov told us their role may increase in the 
future.
