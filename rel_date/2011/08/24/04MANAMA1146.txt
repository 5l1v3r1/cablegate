¶1.  The six detainees held by the GOB on suspicion of 
conspiracy to commit terrorist acts (see ref) ended their 
hunger strike after four days. The detainees' lawyer Abdullah 
Hashim was quoted in the Bahrain Tribune on July 19 that the 
six agreed to end the hunger strike due to the deteriorating 
health of detainees Yasser Kamal and Moheiddin Khan and 
because civil societies and human rights groups publicly 
expressed support of the detainees' efforts to prove their 
innocence.  Hashim told PolOFF on July 18 the GOB allowed 
detainees' families visitation rights but has denied 
visitation requests from the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights. 
 
¶2.  Hashim told PolOFF on July 18 that he anticipates a march 
in support of his clients to take place on July 23 following 
Friday sermons, but would not identify the organizers.  He 
also said that any protest must be carried out legally and 
peacefully. If not, Hashim is convinced that a violent 
protest will influence the case against his clients and he 
would be forced to publicly condemn the march.
