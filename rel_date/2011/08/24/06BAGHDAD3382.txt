Begin Text: 
Dear President George W Bush, 
On behalf of the people of Iraq, I would like to extend our most 
 
sincere and deepest sympathy and condolences for the families of 
those who died in the atrocity of September 11. 
As victims of terror, we feel their pain. As committed fighters 
against terrorism - our common enemy, we reaffirm that our resolve 
to defeat the terrorists and promote the values of freedom, peace 
and democracy in Iraq, will never be shaken. 
On this sad and memorable day, I would like to reiterate the 
gratitude of the people of Iraq for the people of America and for 
your leadership. 
The people of Iraq will never forget those who helped them in 
getting rid of the most brutal and terrorist regime of Saddam 
Hussein. 
 
Sincerely Yours 
Jalal Talabani 
President of the Republic of Iraq
