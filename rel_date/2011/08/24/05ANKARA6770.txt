SUBJECT: TURKEY COMMITTED TO SE EUROPE ENERGY PROCESS, BUT 
WILL NOT SIGN THE DOTTED LINE 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Turkey insists that it will continue to 
participate in the SE Europe energy integration process, but 
will not sign the Brussels treaty (recent ceremony in 
Brussels), because they will not foreclose on the option to 
negotiate longer transition time-frames to achieve energy and 
environment acquis in EU accession.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Explaining Turkey,s decision not to sign the 
Brussels (formerly Athens Process) SE Europe Energy Treaty, 
GOT MinEnergy DDG Mithat Rende told EnergyOff that Turkey was 
fully committed to integrating with SE Europe and EU energy 
markets.  Rende noted that Energy Minister Guler attended the 
meeting, but that Turkey had previously made clear its 
reservations to the treaty.  Asserting that the treaty 
language was rushed and flawed, Rende said that Turkey had 
offered comments, but the EU Commission was unwilling to 
adjust the treaty draft.  Rende asserted that its 
reservations had been carefully explained to the Commission 
and they had expected some acknowledgement of Turkey,s 
"special" situation, but the Commission seemingly decided to 
pressure Turkey to sign anyway. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Rende explained that Turkey could not commit to 
achieving the EU energy and environment acquis in the 
one-year time frame required by the Brussels treaty.  Turkey 
needed the time that would be allowed under the EU accession 
negotiations to reach harmonization, and or negotiate special 
exemptions or time periods.  In other words, it was a 
practical issue of time and cost. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment: Turkey let a highly symbolic moment pass, 
and did not join the treaty signing, but the Minister was 
there for the photo op.  Turkey is committed to energy market 
integration and harmonization as part of EU accession, but 
will insist on the right to negotiate special exemptions 
(just as safeguards will be forced on them in many areas). 
It will be a long and painful process for both sides.
