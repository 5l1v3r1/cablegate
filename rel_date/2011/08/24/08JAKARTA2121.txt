SUBJECT: INDONESIAN TSUNAMI WARNING SYSTEM LAUNCHED 
 
1.(U) President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono launched the Indonesian 
Tsunami Warning System on November 11 at a ceremony in Jakarta. 
President Yudhoyono noted that Indonesia developed the USD 133 
million system with help from Germany, China, Japan, France and the 
United States.  During his remarks, President Yudhoyono noted that 
the technology of a tsunami warning system cannot be effective 
without a community "culture" of preparedness and response and asked 
local authorities to conduct tsunami evacuation drills and other 
preparedness activities to complement the Indonesian Tsunami Early 
Warning System (Ina-TEWS) detection and warning technology. 
 
¶2. (U) The Government of Indonesia has concentrated first on at-risk 
areas (Aceh, West Sumatra, Bengkulu, Banten and Bali) in developing 
Ina-TEWS.  A series of national drills on the Indian Ocean Tsunami 
anniversary has raised awareness, tested system components, and 
promoted community preparedness in Indonesia.  As of October 2008, 
the system is comprised of 116 broadband seismometers, 45 tidal 
gauges, and three buoys.  Three more buoys are stored in the Port of 
Jakarta and are awaiting installation.  The government initially 
planned to operate 160 broadband seismometers, 500 accelerographs, 
40 GPS units, 80 tidal gauges and 23 buoys, but lacks sufficient 
funding to meet all requirements. 
 
¶3. (U) The U.S. donated a Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of 
Tsunamis (DART) tsunameter under the U.S. Indian Ocean Tsunami 
Warning Program in September 2007. Under a 2006 United States and 
Indonesia agreement for scientific and technological cooperation on 
natural hazards assessment, analysis, warnings, preparedness and 
mitigation, the United States also provided $1 million toward the 
development of the Indonesian tsunami warning system which included 
the donation of a Deep-Ocean Assessment Reporting tsunameter (DART), 
technical assistance and capacity building. The NOAA DART tsunameter 
was deployed off the coast of Bali. 
 
¶4. (U) Vandalism (both purposeful and accidental damage) to tsunami 
detection equipment has emerged as a serious problem throughout the 
Indian Ocean region.  All of the tsunameters Indonesia has deployed 
have been vandalized, including the two DART tsunameter systems the 
U.S. donated. India has reported the loss of at least six of nine 
deployed tsunameters.  These problems are typical of moored 
instruments in tropical waters.  At Intergovernmental Oceanographic 
Commission meetings during the week of November 9 in Bali, a main 
topic was countering vandalism through education; new, less visible 
technologies; and other measures.
