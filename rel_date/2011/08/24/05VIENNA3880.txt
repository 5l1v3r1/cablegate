SUBJECT: DEMARCHE TO AUSTRIA:  SEEKING PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR 
DECEMBER 15 ELECTION 
 
REF: STATE 220728 
 
¶1.  Ambassador raised our desire for a strong national 
statement of support for the December 15 Iraqi elections with 
Austrian Foreign Ministry Secretary General Johannes Kyrle on 
December 13.  Separately, EconPolCouns discussed the issue 
with Ralph Scheide, the MFA's assistant secretary-level 
Director for Middle East and African Affairs. 
 
¶2.  Kyrle said he was almost certain the upcoming European 
Council meeting would address the Iraq elections; he would 
also consider the possibility of an Austrian national 
statement.  Scheide said he thought it likely that Austria 
would issue a supportive statement, assuming all went as well 
as we all expected. 
 
¶3.  On out of country voting (OCV), Scheide noted that 
Austria was one of the centers in Europe for Iraqi voting. 
Austria would facilitate the Iraqi effort, Scheide said. 
 
¶4.  On debt, we note that Austria has forgiven 80 percent of 
Iraq's debt, a sum which amounts to approximately one percent 
of Austria's GDP.
