SUBJECT: RESPONSE RECEIVED: FOLLOWING UP ON U.S. PROPOSAL 
AT THE NUCLEAR SUPPLIER'S GROUP (NSG) PLENARY TO SHARE IRAN 
EXPORT DENIAL INFORMATION 
 
REF: STATE 69315 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On May 22, poloff delivered reftel points, 
including the non-paper, to Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade (MOFAT) Disarmament and Non-Proliferation officer Youn 
Jong Kwon.  A response was provided by Kwon on May 30 
addressing the U.S. proposal "that Nuclear Suppliers Group 
(NSG) Participating Governments agree to share their export 
denial information on Iran with the IAEA Secretariat, the UN 
Security Council Iran Sanctions Committee, and non-NSG states 
to facilitate the most effective implementation of UNSC 
Resolutions 1737 and 1747." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kwon noted that the ROKG was willing to share the 
requested information "on the condition that the ROK not be 
listed as a signatory on the June 4 letter to the IAEA." 
Because of the ROK's bilateral ties with Iran, he asked that 
the U.S. representative to the IAEA sign this letter on 
behalf of the collective of interested states.  Kwon 
emphasized that the ROKG would appreciate advance notice if 
there would be a listing of the participating countries in 
this letter, as this would affect ROKG involvement. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In accordance with reftel's suggested format, Kwon 
stated that one item had been denied export to Iran.  The 
item denied was a Vacuum Induction Furnace (for Casting) 
(NR1.b.7).  The procurement agent utilized was Seihawi 
Trading Co., United Arab Emirates.  The intended end user was 
Mavadkaran Jahed Noavar Eng. Co., Iran.  Kwon did not provide 
a reason for the denial but did say that "this is the ROKG's 
only denial case against Iran."
