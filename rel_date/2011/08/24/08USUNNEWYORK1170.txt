SUBJECT: DFI/IAMB RESOLUTION: DEC 12 UPDATE FROM NEW YORK 
 
REF: USUN 1164 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Security Council met at expert-level on December 
12 to discuss renewal of the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) 
and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB). 
Discussion went smoothly, and substantive requests were 
largely as predicted.  Russia requested language calling for 
quarterly briefings on DFI/IAMB by the UN, and also called 
for a briefing by the World Bank and IMF regarding the IAMB. 
Several countries agreed with Russia,s request, including 
South Africa, Libya, France, and Costa Rica.  Separately, 
Libya asked for inclusion of UNSCR 1790 language that deals 
with sectarianism and national reconciliation.  Belgium also 
requested adding in a reference to Iraq,s upcoming elections. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Turning to next steps, Council members agreed with 
the basic timeline, barring any last-minute problems: the 
draft resolution would go into blue on Tuesday, December 16, 
with adoption on Wednesday, December 17.  Council members 
also agreed that the meeting on December 17 would be strictly 
an adoption, without the need for a briefing or consultations.
