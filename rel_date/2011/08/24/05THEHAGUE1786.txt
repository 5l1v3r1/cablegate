 (SBU)  Following up reftel discussion, Marit van Zomeren 
(MFA, Afghan Deskoff) advised Poloff June 23 that the Dutch 
embassy in Kabul told her June 22 they would support 
delivering a well-prepared joint demarche on this issue at 
the political level in Kabul, perhaps targeting President 
Karzai.  Van Zomeren noted that the Dutch Embassy was very 
active on this file already and asked for the name of the POC 
at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, adding they would appreciate 
the Department's advising the Embassy of the Dutch interest 
in a joint demarche.
