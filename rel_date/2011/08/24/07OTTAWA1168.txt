On June 18, Embassy Ottawa delivered reftel non-paper to Yves 
Beaulieu, Deputy Director for Counter-terrorism, 
International Crime and Terrorism Division, DFAIT.  Beaulieu 
had no initial reaction except to promise to circulate the 
information about the USG's designation of additional Iranian 
entities and individuals immediately to relevant offices 
within the Canadian Government.  We asked for any substantive 
reaction before June 29.
