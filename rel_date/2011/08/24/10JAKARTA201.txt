¶3.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Following our failure to reach an 
agreement to establish the Indonesia-United States 
Center for Biomedical and Public Health Research (IUC), 
GOI officials have confirmed that they regard NAMRU-2 
closed.  We have begun moving equipment from NAMRU-2 
facilities and are preparing to transfer the facility 
to GOI control before the visas for NAMRU-2 personnel 
expire on March 15.  We request Washington concurrence 
to proceed with the termination of NAMRU-2's 
Indonesian employees at an appropriate time.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
GOI CONSIDERS NAMRU-2 CLOSED 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Following the unsuccessful conclusion of 
talks aimed at establishing the IUC, the Indonesian 
government considers NAMRU-2 to be closed.  Bunyan 
Saptomo, Director for North American Affairs at the 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) reiterated this 
point in a February 16 meeting with Econ/C.   Saptomo 
noted former Health Minister Supari's letter of 
October 16, 2009, which informed the USG that the GOI 
considered the 1970 agreement governing NAMRU-2 to be 
terminated.  The GOI's diplomatic note of December 31, 
2009 reiterated this point, he explained.  (Mission 
has sent copies of both documents to EAP/MTS and 
L/EAP.)  Bunyan said that with the termination of the 
NAMRU-2 agreement and no agreement to move forward 
with the IUC, the GOI considered NAMRU-2 to be closed. 
 
FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Mission has begun preparing NAMRU-2's 
current facility (located on a GOI Ministry of Health 
compound) and all fixed equipment contained therein 
for transfer to GOI control, as provided for in the 
expired 1970 NAMRU-2 agreement.  We have already 
transported all high-value equipment to the Embassy 
warehouse and have engaged a moving company to 
transport other USG-owned equipment from the facility. 
Per the terms of the 1970 agreement, NAMRU-2 will 
transfer all biological specimens to the Indonesian 
government.   Econ/C briefed DEPLU director Saptomo on 
these steps.  Bunyan said the GOI concurred with this 
course of action. 
 
TERMINATING EMPLOYEES 
 
¶6.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Mission requests Washington 
concurrence to proceed with the next step of the NAMRU 
shutdown-the termination of the facility's 
approximately 150 Indonesian employees.  Mission's HR 
section is preparing severance packages for these 
employees in accordance with applicable Indonesian 
labor laws and regulations.  With Washington's 
concurrence, we are prepared to inform these employees 
of their termination at an appropriate time.  END 
ACTION REQUEST.
