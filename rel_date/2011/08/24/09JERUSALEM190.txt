Main Stories: 
------------- 
All papers lead with news on Cairo meetings with Palestinian 
factions.  They note that for the first time since the "war on Gaza" 
a Fatah representative, Azzam Al Ahmad, met with a Hamas 
 
representative, Jamal Abu Hashim.  Al Quds describes the meeting as 
an, "indication of reconciliation."  Al Hayat Al Jadida adds that 
Fatah is demanding a Palestinian Authority (PA) national consensus 
government, whereas Hamas does not view the issue as a priority and 
would prefer instead to focus on brokering a ceasefire with Israel 
and reopening Gaza crossings.  Al Quds further adds that Egypt 
believes that pending agreement by Palestinian factions, a ceasefire 
can begin on February 5 and Palestinian internal talks can begin on 
February 22. 
 
All papers front page statements by President Obama from a January 
26 meeting with Secretary Clinton, noting the importance of Middle 
East peace to U.S. national interests and its importance to him 
personally.  President Obama is quoted saying that Middle East peace 
envoy Mitchell will work hard to achieve "tangible results" to 
realize peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  In coverage of 
special envoy Mitchell's visit to the region, that paper report 
begins on January 27, all headlines highlight that, "Obama gives all 
needed authority to Mitchell for achieving real progress" in the 
regional peace process.  The papers add that the "the listening" 
Senator will meet and listen to Palestinian, Israeli and Jordanian 
leaders during his visit. 
U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N. Susan Rice is quoted on Al 
Ayyam's inside pages, stating on January 26 that the U.S. will 
conduct "vigorous and direct" diplomacy with Iran.  The paper also 
runs an inside Reuters story on calls made by both Democrats and 
Republicans for reform to U.S. foreign aid policies.  A third inside 
report by AFP,  quotes Brookings Institution political expert 
Benjamin Wittes explaining the obstacles that stand in President 
Obama's way to closing the Guantanamo Detention Center. 
In news on diplomatic efforts, Al Quds reports on its front page 
that Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister announced during a January 26 
meeting with the PLO Ambassador in Moscow, that Russia is preparing 
for an international conference on the Middle East for sometime 
during the first half of 2009.  Meanwhile, Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al 
Jadida front page that Yemen has officially submitted a proposal for 
Palestinian reconciliation based on four points:  Return to internal 
dialogue, formation of a national unity, non-factional Palestinian 
Authority (PA) government, reform of PA police, and recognition of 
the Palestinian constitution and law. 
 
Al Quds' front page cites AFP in reporting that eight Palestinian 
factions, including Hamas, announced at a press conference in 
Damascus on January 26 that Palestinian Authority President Abbas' 
term in office has ended. 
In news on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Al Quds' front page 
quotes an International Red Cross Committee spokesman in Gaza 
describing it as, "very dangerous."  He noted that thousands of 
families remain homeless, camping out over the remains of their 
houses.  The paper also cites AFP in quoting EU foreign relations 
Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner complaining in Brussels on 
January 26 about Israel's closure of Gaza crossings, adding that the 
EU is "somehow disappointed" over the slow flow of humanitarian 
assistance through the crossings.  Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida's 
front pages cite AFP in quoting the EU development and humanitarian 
affairs Commissioner Louis Michel described Gaza devastation as 
"beyond description" and accused Hamas of being "overwhelmingly 
responsible" for "the Gaza war."  Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida's 
front pages cite AFP in reporting that the homeless in Gaza are 
still waiting for the promised Hamas' assistance to "war victims."

can begin on February 5 and Palestinian internal talks can begin on 
February 22. 
 
Meanwhile, all front pages highlight that urgent assistance has been 
allocated by the Palestinian Authority (PA) to "war victims" in Gaza 
at the direction of PA President Abbas. 
Criticism of Israel's Chief Army Rabbi appears on the front pages of 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida who cite news agencies in reporting 
that Rabbi Ronzki ordered Israeli soldiers to kill Palestinians 
without mercy.  The papers report that the Israeli human rights 
group "Yesh Din" demanded the immediate firing of Ronzki.  In other 
Israel news, the front pages cite Israeli newspapers when 
highlighting quotes by Israeli opposition leader Netanyahu that he 
would not build new settlements, but would allow for natural growth, 
should he be elected Prime Minister. 
 
In photo coverage, Al Quds runs a lead photo of a Gaza woman, whose 
two daughters were killed in the recent conflict, carrying an infant 
while inspecting her destroyed house.  Al Ayyam runs a lead photo of 
children having a meal in a temporary shelter near their destroyed 
Gaza homes.  Al Hayat Al Jadida runs a photo of EU Development and 
Humanitarian Affairs Commissioner Louis Michel inspecting the 
devastated Al Quds hospital in Gaza City.-------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
 
1)  Al Quds editorial is titled, "While we descend into greater 
division and gossip, they [Israelis] grow more extreme and rightwing 
in their tendencies" (01/27):  "As we descend into our differences 
and media nonsense and fight over fleeting, no, actually nonexistent 
positions, we see our homeland, or whatever remains of it, falling 
too.  [It falls prey to] settlement activities, judaization, and 
other Israeli practices... whereas, in Israel, the extremist 
rightwing, or the racial rightwing led by Lieberman is growing 
stronger and gaining support among Israelis." 
2)  Hani Al Masri opines in Al Ayyam under the title, "Once again, 
Palestinian obstacles impede reconciliation":  "If Hamas believes 
that undermining the status of the PLO as the sole representative of 
the Palestinian people will automatically mean... a new Palestinian 
legitimacy led by Hamas, it is mistaken.  Undermining the united 
representation of the Palestinians will constitute a net loss for 
Palestinians and net profit for Israel and [the Arab world]..." 
 
3)  Muhannad Abdul Hamid writes in Al Ayyam under the title "The 
massacre ... and self evaluation" (01/27):  "The negative position 
towards national unity means that the resistance has its own goals, 
such as the establishment of a one-party Islamic emirate atop the 
remains of cultural and political pluralism, and the homeland [Gaza 
Strip.]  The emirate comes at an enormous cost:  Revoking the right 
to an independent statehood, the right of return and Jerusalem."
