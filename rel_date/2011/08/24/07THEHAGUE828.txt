(SBU) Poloff shared reftel points with Dutch MFA's Horn of Africa 
Division Head, Huub Buise, May 2.  Buise, who is traveling to Sudan 
May 3 with Dutch Development Minister Koenders, gave the following 
initial, written response. 
 
Begin text: We share your concern that a weak TDRA means a threat 
for the DPA.  Minawi as the only signatory has to be able to play a 
role as senior presidential advisor and as head of the TDRA.  It 
would be encouraging if the GoS were enabling Minawi to play this 
role and providing him with the necessary means (as was promised). 
So far this is not happening, and the international community should 
point out the risks of weakening Minawi.  On the other hand, I 
wonder whether assisting Minawi and the TDRA with external funds and 
technical advisors will not lead to a further gap with the 
non-signatories.  The DPA is contested by some groups and if some 
elements of the DPA, especially those related to the power sharing 
arrangements, are further implemented, the willingness of those 
groups to accept the DPA (with annexes) might even further 
decrease. 
 
However, your points are interesting, and it is worthwhile to 
elaborate on how to implement them and strengthen the DPA without 
losing the rest of stakeholders.  We will come back to you later on 
this issue.  End text.
