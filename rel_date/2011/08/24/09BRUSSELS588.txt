Summary: 
--------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Since your last visit to Brussels, dialogue between 
the U.S. and Belgium on Africa has continued.  Belgian 
interest is currently focused on the plight of the Belgian 
ship taken over by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean April 
17, and a Belgian doctor kidnapped in Somalia at the same 
time.  Meanwhile, the Belgians are waiting for the new U.S. 
administration to be more fully formed before sending a team 
to Washington to discuss strengthening security in the DRC, 
following up on the March 6 discussion between the Secretary 
and Foreign Minister De Gucht.  Washington AFRICOM Deputy 
Commander Mary Yates visited Brussels in March, and met with 
Belgian military officials, the Foreign Ministry, Members of 
Parliament, African Defense Attaches, and NGOs. 
Subsequently, a high level Belgian military delegation 
traveled to Stuttgart to share lessons learned in the DRC 
with AFRICOM counterparts.  The Belgians have agreed to our 
request to co-host with us a meeting in Brussels of partners 
on Security Sector Reform in the DRC on May 12.  Your meeting 
with Belgium's MFA Africa hands will advance the dialogue 
between the U.S. and Belgium on shared priorities in Africa. 
African countries remain the primary beneficiaries of Belgian 
development assistance, and the DRC a focal point of Belgian 
foreign policy.  Suggested talking points are provided at 
paragraph 10.  End Summary. 
 
Recent Political Background 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Africa, and especially the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo (DRC) continues to be a priority for the Belgian 
government and FM De Gucht personally.  The rift in Belgium's 
relations with the DRC that followed FM De Gucht's public 
criticism of DRC President Kabila in 2008 has been partly 
repaired. A new, highly regarded Ambassador (former Belgian 
Ambassador to the U.S. Dominique Struye) is now in place in 
Kinshasa. Belgium's consulates in Lubumbashi and Bukavu 
remain shuttered, although the DRC has approved reopening 
Lubumbashi, and the Belgian MFA is planning to do so this 
summer.  Belgium remains very cautious about leadership roles 
in Africa peacekeeping missions, a result of the death of its 
soldiers in Rwanda in 1994.  De Gucht failed in a concerted 
effort late last year to persuade fellow EU nations to 
provide a "bridging force" to support MONUC in Eastern Congo. 
 While Belgians have extensive personal, family and economic 
ties to the DRC, Belgian business interests there have waned 
in recent years as the Chinese role has expanded.  Belgian 
political interest in the DRC today centers to a significant 
degree on conflict resolution, human rights and humanitarian 
concerns. 
 
Somali Piracy 
-------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Belgians' attention will be on Somalia, because 
of the April 19 hijacking of a Belgian vessel by Somali 
pirates in a long range attack near the Seychelles.  A 
Belgian doctor was kidnapped in Somalia at the same time, 
apparently by an unrelated group, and has not been released. 
The Belgian ship is reported to be en route to the Somali 
coast. Earlier this year, Belgium announced its intent to 
send one of its two frigates to participate in EU anti-piracy 
operations in the Indian Ocean.  The frigate is expected to 
arrive by October for three months. 
 
Democratic Republic of the Congo 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Belgium remains focused on the humanitarian 
situation in the eastern DRC. Belgian officials are skeptical 
about recent and ongoing military cooperation between the 
DRC, Uganda and Rwanda against rebel groups in the eastern 
DRC. They would like to see comprehensive rapprochement 
between Kinshasa and Kigali, but are skeptical of the wisdom 
of the DRC inviting troops from other countries into its 
territory in light of the potential for violence to spiral. 
Nevertheless, the Belgians are realistic about the limited 
impact of their efforts to improve the ability of the DRC 
military to provide security throughout the country.  FM De 
 
BRUSSELS 00000588  002 OF 003 
 
 
Gucht told the Secretary March 6 that in his view 
strengthening the DRC military is fundamental to long term 
stability, and agreed to send a team to Washington to consult 
with U.S. counterparts on possible efforts to strengthen the 
DRC military.  The Belgians have indicated a desire to send 
this team after our administration's senior Africa officials 
are in place. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Belgium is actively engaged in Security Sector 
Reform (SSR) in the DRC, and coordinates with the U.S. and 
other donors in the region on this topic.  The MFA will 
co-host with State a May 12 meeting in Brussels for European 
and American SSR experts.  The Belgian military provides a 
handful of advisors to the DRC Ministry of Defense, as well 
as a team leader and eight observers to MONUC.  Belgium is 
disappointed with the limited impact of its effort to train a 
battalion of Rapid Reaction Forces at Kananga, but the 
Ministry of Defense plans regular follow up training. 
 
Sudan/Chad/Benin 
---------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Belgium has contributed a multifunctional military 
detachment to the EUFOR operation to protect Sudanese 
refugees in Chad since February 2008. A Field Accommodation 
Unit is responsible for construction and maintenance of camps 
at Abeche and N'djamena.  A special task force performs 
reconnaissance and surveillance for EUFOR troops.  Other 
troops provide logistical support to the Belgian force.  Five 
unarmed Belgian military observers have participated in the 
UN Mission in Sudan since its establishment in 2005. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  From January to April 2009, Belgium has deployed 
75 troops in Benin who are constructing a shooting range and 
training facilities for peacekeepers.  The Belgians have 
planned for regular follow up training.  Two Belgian liaison 
officers support Benin's troops engaged in peacekeeping in 
Cote d'Ivoire with ONUCI. 
 
Coordination with AFRICOM 
------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Cooperation between the Belgian MOD and the U.S. 
Africa Command is growing.  Top Belgian Army officers have 
met with AFRICOM leadership on two occasions since March, 
including a visit by Deputy AFRICOM commander Yates to 
Brussels and a visit to AFRICOM headquarters by a Belgian 
military delegation to share lessons learned in west Africa. 
AFRICOM officers have said they find the Belgians 
knowledgeable on Africa issues, with a high level of 
engagement at the senior ranks.  As AFRICOM gears up to train 
a Congolese battalion, the Belgians have shared their 
insights into the opportunities and challenges inherent in 
training forces in the DRC.  Belgium has expressed 
willingness to participate in the Africa Partnership Station 
(APS), first by providing Belgian trainers to accompany the 
mission, and later possibly by providing a ship to carry U.S. 
and other allied personnel on APS missions.  The Belgians 
have also offered to provide a liaison officer for the U.S. 
Operation Shared Accord in Benin. The Belgian Defense 
Ministry is interested in providing a full-time liaison 
officer to AFRICOM's Stuttgart headquarters when AFRICOM is 
in a position to accept such officers. 
 
Civilian Development Assistance 
------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) In 2007, Belgium world development assistance 
totaled 1.4 billion euros, or 0.43% of its GDP.  This figure 
was down from 0.5% in 2006.  In 2007, the DRC was the largest 
recipient of Belgian aid at 153 million euros.  Other large 
recipients were Cameroon, Rwanda and Burundi.  Direct 
development aid administered by Belgian employees of Belgian 
Technical Assistance is limited to 18 "partner countries," of 
which 13 are in Africa.  Other countries receive Belgian 
money via the UN or other international organizations and 
NGOs.  The Embassy has worked to increase cooperation and 
coordination with Belgium on assistance to Africa.  We are 
also focused on trying to get Belgium to increase assistance 
to Afghanistan, a key U.S. priority.

when you are ready to send one.  We understand your interest 
in waiting for our new leadership to be in place.

willingness to share experiences and lessons learned.  We

also greatly appreciate the new resources you are providing 
for assistance to Afghanistan. In this difficult economic 
environment, it is more important than ever to ensure that 
resources remain available for the least advantaged 
countries.
