SUBJECT: IVLP ALUMNI BREAKFAST DISCUSSES LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES 
 
REF: NONE 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: The Ambassador recently hosted a breakfast discussion 
for IVLP returnees, the seventh in a series that has now become an 
established routine here.  This latest event brought together eight 
recent IVLP alumni who are locally elected officials from different 
regions and cities in France for a discussion of "Local Governance 
in the U.S." and how it compares to the French experience.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  On September 28, Ambassador Stapleton hosted the seventh in a 
series of alumni breakfast discussions that have now become a 
successful tradition at this post.  This breakfast brought together 
eight IVLP alumni, who are local and regional government officials, 
to discuss their exchange experiences, in general, and to compare, 
more specifically, U.S. and French perspectives on local governance. 
A major theme of the discussion was the relative lack of 
involvement/interest from French citizens in politics and the 
challenge this poses in terms of advancing a common agenda. 
 
¶3.  The participants were: 
 
- Andree BUCHMANN, Vice-President of Regional Council for Les Verts 
(Green Party), IV 1994 
- Alexandre GALDIN, Elected City Advisor for UMP (Conservative 
Party), IV 2006 
 
- Sebastien HUYGHE, Member of the National Assembly for UMP, IV 
2006 
 
- Loick LE BRUN, City Councilor for UMP, IV 2002 
 
- Denis LEROY, City Councilor for the Socialist Party, Member of the 
electoral team of Segolene Royal, IV 2000 
 
- Thierry MANDON, Mayor for the Socialist Party, IV 1992 
 
- Dorothee PINEAU, Regional Counselor for UDF, Assistant Mayor of 
Boulogne-Billancourt, IV 2000 
 
- Jacques VERNIER, Mayor for UMP, IV 1987 
 
¶4.  Welcoming the guests along with the Ambassador and participating 
in the discussion were the DCM, POL Min-Counselor, PA Min-Counselor, 
ECON Officer, and ACAO Exchanges Officer. 
 
¶5.  All of the guests had an opportunity to speak, and each 
explained how important his or her trip to the U.S. was to 
understanding how Americans address issues of local governance, 
including economic development, integration policies, and the role 
of elected officials.  The visit contradicted their common belief 
that U.S. city centers were abandoned, as they were able to 
appreciate the proliferation and efficiency of public/private 
partnerships in urban development and revitalization. This led to a 
discussion of the current situation in France, where problems of 
urban violence and lack of integration are aggravated by a general 
lack of interest by citizens in the res publica. 
 
¶6.  With French presidential elections coming up next May, the issue 
of participatory democracy is on the lips of every candidate, yet 
the challenge remains how to inspire citizens to become more active 
in building their future. The alumni praised the various forms of 
citizen actions, initiatives and sense of community in the U.S., 
which they see as a key objective for their cities. While they 
seemed at a loss to determine exactly how they could reach this 
objective, they did agree that the use of new technologies 
(including blogs) is essential to ensuring French politicians are 
informed of opinion trends and can participate in on-going debates. 
 
 
¶7.  Lessons learned: The experience of these breakfast encounters 
reaffirms for us the continuing relevance of the IVLP and VolVis 
exchange programs to Mission efforts to influence the public debate 
in France.  On the subject of local governance, the exchange 
experience in the U.S. gave these elected officials new information 
about the U.S. that provides models for encouraging greater 
participation by citizens in France's democracy. Post will continue 
follow up with these USG exchange alumni and continue to involve 
them in our public diplomacy program activities.
