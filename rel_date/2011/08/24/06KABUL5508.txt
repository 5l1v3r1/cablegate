¶I. SUMMARY 
 
¶1. (SBU) During this reporting period, EXBS Advisor worked with 
international donors and the Afghan Engineering District (AED) to 
de-conflict, provide input, and review status of the Border Crossing 
Points (BCPs) infrastructure projects. A timeline of infrastructure 
projects has been provided by the Afghan Engineering District (AED) 
for construction projects at the Islam Qalah, Towraghundi, and Shir 
Khan Bandar Border Crossing Points (BCP) to provide better security, 
more efficient port operations, and increased revenue collection. 
 
¶2. (SBU) EXBS Advisor is working with all donors involved with 
equipping the 13 major BCPs and the 4 international airports to 
identify the needs and ensure compatibility of items procured. 
 
¶3. (SBU) USG Border Management Initiative (BMI) staff is progressing 
with the staffing of a 12 person Border Management Task Force 
(BMTF).  DOD funding will also allow for the hiring of 12 mentors 
that will be assigned to select BCPs.  See para 24 for ACTION 
REQUEST. 
 
¶4. (SBU) EXBS Advisor and the Border Management Initiative partners 
are monitoring DynCorp's re-establishment of their mentorship 
program with the Afghan Border Police (ABP) at the Islam Qalah and 
the Spin Boldak BCPs. DynCorp also announced their planned 
construction of 2 Forward Operating Bases (FOB) at Islam Qalah in 
the Herat Province and Spin Boldak in the Khandahar Province.  These 
FOBs are needed to house DynCorp mentors closer to the BCPs located 
in these cities. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On September 19 - 21, 2006, EXBS Advisor discussed with 
Emboffs from U.S. Embassy Tashkent a telephone line that had been 
installed at the Uzbek and Afghan BCPs for cross-border 
communications. 
 
¶6. (U) During this reporting period, EXBS Advisor selected a Kabul 
resident as the EXBS Program Coordinator.  The applicant has 
extensive experience in finance and revenue projects as an employee 
with the USAID contractor Bearing Point and the Ministry of 
Finance. 
 
END SUMMARY 
 
II. ITEMS OF BROAD INTEREST. 
 
¶7. (SBU) During this reporting period, EXBS Advisor worked with 
international donors and the Afghan Engineering District (AED) to 
de-conflict, provide input, and review status of the Border Crossing 
Points infrastructure projects. To date, approximately 90% of the 13 
major Afghan BCPs are in place, under construction, or have funding 
committed.  This includes a $13 million U.S.(JIACG)-funded new 
commercial BCP being constructed at Islam Qalah beginning in 
November 2006.  This BCP is considered the largest revenue 
generating crossing point, accounting for almost 50% of all revenue 
collected by the Government of Afghanistan (GoA).  Completion is 
expected to be in February 2008. 
 
¶8. (SBU) A $350K U.S.-funded project is also underway at the 
existing Islam Qalah BCP to improve the traffic flow, road surface, 
and security features.  This upgrade will help support the operation 
of the facility during the construction of the new BCP. 
 
¶9. (SBU) A $600K U.S.-funded BCP project at Towraghundi is currently 
underway to upgrade the commercial depot for customs and the Afghan 
Border Police (ABP) immigration facilities.  UNOPS has also 
 
KABUL 00005508  002.2 OF 004 
 
 
constructed a customs administrative office to assist in the 
upgrade. 
 
¶10. (SBU) The new Shir Khan Bandar BCP is currently under 
construction under a $4 million U.S.-funded project which is 
expected to be completed in May 2007.  The bridge connecting the 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan BCPs at this location is scheduled to be 
completed in May 2007. An additional European Commission $14 million 
funded commercial depot at this BCP is scheduled for completion in 
December 2007. 
 
¶11. (SBU) EXBS Advisor has compiled a list of equipment required at 
the 13 major BCPs that has either been provided or funded for 
procurement and a list of equipment needs yet to be funded.  It is 
estimated that an additional $8 million is required to provide the 
basic equipment needs at the majority of the BCPs.  Larger items 
required for commercial operations, i.e., forklifts, cranes, weigh 
stations, service vehicles, furnishings and multiple types of 
scanners at the 13 major BCPs and the 4 international airports is 
estimated to cost $90 million. 
 
¶12. (SBU) During this reporting period the ISN/ECC Program Manager 
for South Asia initiated an Action Cable describing the procurement 
of equipment destined for the Islam Qalah and Towraghundi BCPs 
totaling over $1 million. Equipment being procured includes x-ray 
screening machines for baggage and cargo, fiberoptic scopes, density 
meters, radioisotope identifiers, explosive detectors, handheld 
metal detectors, cranes, forklifts, vehicle inspection kits, and 
tool kits. EXBS Advisor and Embassy Econ Officer formally advised 
the Director General for the Afghan Customs Department (ACD) of the 
pending procurement for the BCPs and his personnel.  The Director 
General requested, in coordination with the South Asia Program 
Manager, the EXBS Advisor to assist the ACD in procuring $1 million 
in additional equipment for Customs at other BCPs to ensure 
compatibility. 
 
¶13. (SBU)  EXBS and the BMI continue to work with the security 
elements at the Kabul International Airport (KIA) to address 
security deficiencies such as new badging and vehicle pass systems; 
radio communications; terminal and airside security measures; 
perimeter security; equipment needs; and training.  A Japanese 
funded $28 million project is beginning in October 2006 to construct 
a new terminal and an additional $5 million for the new ramp area. 
These facilities are expected to be completed in 2009.  In the 
interim, the European Commission is expending $2 million for 
operational upgrades at the existing terminal while the new terminal 
is under construction. 
 
¶14. (SBU) EXBS and the BMI have consulted with the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) representative and secured $2 million from the 
Ministry of Transportation to be used for security upgrades at KIA. 
Additionally, FAA has begun procuring as many as 8 large scanners 
and 8 handheld metal detecting wands totaling $2.5 million to be 
used at KIA. 
 
¶15. (SBU) EXBS Advisor examined the automated immigration system 
known as PISCES at KIA and found it to be fully upgraded and 
operational.  Efforts are underway to provide an internet line for 
automatic transmission of data to the Ministry of Interior 
Headquarters where the database for PISCES is maintained.  The 
ISN/ECC Program Manager for South Asia has negotiated for the PISCES 
system to be installed throughout Afghanistan. 
 
¶16. (SBU) EXBS Advisor and the USG BMI representatives, in the 
Afghan Reconstruction Group (ARG), have received and are in the 
process of reviewing applicants for the Border Management Task Force 
(BMTF).  The applicants thus far have been submitted through JIACG 
 
KABUL 00005508  003.2 OF 004 
 
 
and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  JIACG is 
considering a proposal for a contracting mechanism to hire these 
individuals consistent with DoD funding restrictions. Efforts in 
Kabul are continuing to locate suitable working and living 
facilities for the task force members. The Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) is also assisting in recruiting customs and 
immigration subject-matter experts.  BMI participants from the 
international donor community and international subject-matter 
experts will also help make up the task force. 
 
¶17. (SBU) EXBS Advisor and the Border Management Initiative are 
monitoring DynCorp's re-establishment of their mentoring program 
with the Afghan Border Police at the Islam Qalah and the Spin Boldak 
BCPs. The BMI is planning to augment this program by hiring 12 
immigration and customs mentors for these and other BCPs while 
filling positions for the BMI Task Force.  This program has proven 
successful in maintaining order at the BCP; providing oversight; 
implementing proper ABP procedures, roles and responsibilities; and 
reduction of low level corruption.  A new Forward Operating Base 
(FOB) is under construction in Islam Qalah scheduled to be completed 
in November 2006.  DynCorp is also constructing a facility within an 
existing FOB occupied by the Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 
military unit to resume their mentorship at the Spin Boldak BCP. 
They have specifically been requested by ODA to resume their 
activities as part of a larger effort to improve the security 
situation in that region. 
 
¶18. (SBU) On September 19 - 21, 2006 EXBS Advisor met Embassy 
Tashkent Emboffs near the Heratan BCP to discuss a telephone line 
that had been installed at the Uzbek and Afghan BCPs for increased 
cross-border communications.  The meeting revealed that that the 
line, furnished through the EXBS program in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, 
wasn't operational because the installation was inside a newly 
constructed building at the Afghan BCP that had not officially been 
turned over to the Government of Afghanistan by UNOPS.  The 
Afghanistan EXBS Advisor has taken steps to rectify the delay.

NONPROLIFERATION, OR RELATED BORDER SECURITY.

of Preston, has extensive experience with the Ministry of Finance in 
finance and revenue projects in the Takhar Province.  The applicant

undergoing a background investigation being conducted by the US 
Embassy Regional Security Office. 
 
¶24. (U) RED FLAG ISSUES. 
 
ACTION REQUEST.  Post requests that ISN/ECC South Asia Program 
Manager provide assistance by means of coordination and facilitation 
of DoD/DHS support of the BMTF specifically and the BMI in general. 
Of particular concern is the fashioning of the imminent personnel 
support for the BMTF and ensuring that such plans are rationalized 
in light of the current in-country status of the BMI.  END ACTION 
REQUEST.
