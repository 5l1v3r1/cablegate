REF:  Khartoum 1775 
 
¶1. (SBU) CG spoke with two contacts involved in the GoSS mediation 
initiative between the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and the 
Government of Uganda (GOU).  They said that no session took place on 
July 24, but that local press reports stating the talks had broken 
down were overstated.  There were threats to pull out when both 
sides exchanged accusations that military members of each delegation 
had engaged in past atrocities against civilians, including 
decapitations. 
 
¶2. (SBU) A Ugandan interlocutor said that Kony had specifically 
asked to see his mother.  Under the rubric of confidence building, 
the Ugandans agreed that she could visit.  Kony's mother, as well as 
other family members, arrived in Juba and were flown to Maridi in 
the company of GoSS Vice President Machar, notables from the Acholi 
tribes, and various others.
