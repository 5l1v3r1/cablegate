REFTEL: USDOC 0239 
 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine the legitimacy 
and reliability of the end-user, RPC Optolink Ltd, Zelenograd, 
Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license application 
D410990 as the ultimate consignee of three (3) Honeywell 
manufactured QA 650 Accelerometers. These items are controlled for 
national security (NS), missile technology (MT) and anti-terrorism 
(AT) reasons under ECCN 7A001. The licensee is Applanix Corporation, 
85 Leek Crescent, Richmond, Canada. 
 
¶3. In April 2008, RPC Optolink Ltd was the subject of a favorable 
Moscow Post Shipment Verification (Moscow 00973) when the export 
control team conducted an end use check for photosensitive 
semiconductors and light emitting diodes received by RPC Optolink 
Ltd circa 2005. 
 
¶4. On February 11, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested pre-license check at the 
offices of RPC Optolink Ltd, 4806 Proezd, Building 5, Zelenograd, 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Yuri Korkishko, 
General Director. 
 
¶5. RPC Optolink Ltd was founded in 2001 as a joint venture company 
to develop and apply fiber optic and integrated optic technology to 
a new generation of optic sensors and components of fiber optical 
telecommunications.  RPC Optolink Ltd also develops, manufactures 
and supplies a wide assortment of products from fiber and integrated 
optic components to closed loop fiber optic gyros and strapdown 
gyrocompasses, from MEMS gyro & accelerometers to inertial 
measurement systems. 
 
¶6. RPC Optolink Ltd is 96% owned by Malaysian interests (Kedar Wafer 
Emas Sdn Bhn) and exports their products to more than 15 countries, 
including the United States and China.  RPC Optolink Ltd employs 170 
people in three different branches, Moscow (Zelenograd), Saratov and 
Arzamas, Russia. 
 
¶7. Yuri Korkishko, General Director of RPC Optolink Ltd advised the 
export control team that RPC Optolink Ltd had entered into a 
contract with Applanix Corporation of Canada in November 2008 to 
install three (3) U.S. origin Honeywell QA 650 Accelerometers into 
the RPC Optolink Ltd IMU (International Measurement Unit), test the 
unit, and then ship it back to Applanix Corporation in Canada. 
Korkishko stated that the accelerometers are the key component to 
the navigation system and therefore must be shipped to RPC Optolink 
Ltd for installation and testing.  Korkishko advised that in the 
future, Applanix Corporation will purchase RPC Optolink LtdQs 
gyroscope and install the Honeywell Accelerometers in Canada 
themselves.  Korkishko showed the export control team a computerized 
diagram of the installation locations of the three (3) 
Accelerometers. 
 
¶8. Korkishko told the export control team that RPC Optolink Ltd 
supplies their gyroscopes to Lockheed Martin and John Hopkins 
University. 
 
¶9. Korkishko also advised the export control team that approximately 
two (2) years ago RPC Optolink Ltd had email contact with a company 
in Pakistan that was interested in purchasing some items from their 
company.  RPC Optolink Ltd applied for an export license from the 
Russian Export Authorities that was never acted upon.  Instead, 
Korkishko stated that Russian Security Services came to his office 
and advised Korkishko not to pursue the export.  On the advice of 
the Russian Security Services RPC Optolink Ltd withdrew their export 
application.  Korkishko also advised the export control team that 
RPC Optolink Ltd did export one of their dual-use gyroscopes to 
China under an export license from Russia.  Korkishko was later told 
by the Russian Security Services that the company listed at the 
end-user on the export license was not the final Qend-userQ. 
Korkishko blamed the Russian Security Service for not checking out 
the end-use before issuing RPC Optolink Ltd an export license. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends RPC Optolink Ltd, Zelenograd, 
Moscow, Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities. It is requested that post be notified of final 
disposition of the application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and 
statistical reporting.
