REF: STATE 7930 
 
(SBU) On February 8, 2010, Ambassador Nolan delivered reftel's 
talking points and letter to Minister of Foreign Affairs Kenneth 
Tsekoa.  After mentioning that Lesotho had only recently acceded 
to the IAEA and was considering the additional protocols, Tsekoa 
spoke about addressing nuclear issues with his counterpart in 
Iran.  He stated that when he expresses to his Iranian 
counterpart his desire for a nuclear-free world, his counterpart 
agrees.  Asked whether everything Iran is doing in the nuclear 
field is for peaceful purposes, his counterpart says yes 
emphatically, because if it were not, they would end up "blowing 
each other up."  Minister Tsekoa stated that each time he holds 
these discussions, he is sure to encourage Iran to continue on 
this path.
