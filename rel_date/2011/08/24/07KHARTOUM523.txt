REF: KHARTOUM 508 
 
¶1. (U) The Deputy Chief of Mission was called to the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, Department of Protocol, on April 2 in 
order to discuss the New Embassy Compound (NEC).  Ambassador 
Ali Yusuf explained that, while those shipping containers 
holding building materials currently in customs are fully 
cleared, in the future it will be necessary to obtain 
additional approvals for all subsequent shipments. 
Therefore, the Embassy, with as much advance notice as 
possible, should inform the MFA via diplomatic note of 
shipments en route and prior to arrival in port.  The MFA 
will in turn inform the Ministry of Finance in order to 
expedite the clearance of the containers through customs. 
Yusuf explained that this is expected of all diplomatic 
missions in Khartoum and is currently being enforced with 
several new embassy compounds under construction. 
 
¶2. (U) The DCM underscored that there were nearly 350 
additional containers needed for construction of the NEC. 
On-time construction required expeditious processing of these 
containers through customs.  It was imperative that the 
Embassy not find itself in the same situation it was across 
the past six months.  Yusuf said that he understood this and 
that adherence to these procedures would ensure the 
expeditious treatment of future shipments. 
 
¶3. (U) The DCM also provided Yusuf a copy of the Embassy's 
diplomatic note of March 29, which he had not yet seen, but 
which was delivered to the America's Desk.  In it the Embassy 
acknowledged the Ministry's efforts to secure the release of 
the containers in question.  The dipnote also said that the 
Embassy looked forward to the expeditious treatment of future 
shipments.  It further underscored the Embassy's 
understanding that future containers would not be subject to 
"unwarranted retentions or inspections."  Yusuf took issue 
with the latter, insisting that, per the Vienna Convention, 
construction materials were not the same thing as diplomatic 
cargo and that the Government had the right to inspect the 
containers so long as a U.S. official was present.  The DCM 
replied that the Embassy would certainly insist on having 
someone present if any of the containers required inspection. 
 Yusuf stated that the MFA would provide a written response 
to the Embassy's diplomatic note. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  While the Embassy has been the recipient 
of good news of late, this meeting suggests that we're not 
completely out of the woods yet on the container issue.  Nor 
can we overlook the sheer amount of time and energy the 
Mission has expended on this issue across the past six 
months.  Post will continue to monitor closely the container 
issue in order to ensure there are no further impediments in 
the construction of a new embassy in Khartoum.  End comment.
