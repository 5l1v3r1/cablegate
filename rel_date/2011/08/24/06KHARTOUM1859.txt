Oxfam staff member killed in Darfur 
 
It is with deep sorrow that Oxfam announces that one of our staff 
members, Nouraldeen Abdalla Nourein, is believed to have been killed 
last Friday, 28 July, in West Darfur. 
 
Armed men abducted Nouraldeen during a carjacking of an Oxfam 
vehicle in early May.  Despite extensive efforts by Oxfam, the 
United Nations, the African Union, the local community, local 
authorities, and Nouraldeen's family to trace him, we were unable to 
secure his release.  We believe that he was taken to Chad and held 
there until recently. 
 
We have been told that Nouraldeen was making his way back to Saraf 
Omra in North Darfur last week when he was caught up in fighting in 
Helelat village near Kulbus.  We believe that he died there. 
 
Nouraldeen worked with Oxfam as a driver, providing water and 
sanitation to communities in the rural areas near Saraf Omra.  He 
was collecting sand to construct a well when the carjacking took 
place. 
 
Oxfam temporarily closed its office in Saraf Omra at the end of June 
because Nouraldeen was still missing.  While that office remains 
closed, we continue to operate in a number of other locations in 
North Darfur and in South and West Darfur.

¶2. (SBU) Comment:  UNDSS officials (strictly protect), however, 
advised USAID Darfur Field Office staff that OXFAM officials had met 
with them previously regarding Nouraldeen's disappearance and their 
concerns that he may have been involved with a car-hacking ring. 
Their fears include the possibility that he was killed following 
providing information to the police about the operation.  End 
comment.
