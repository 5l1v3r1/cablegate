LIBYA STILL KEEN ON 
ITS TRILATERAL TRACK 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Libya is intent on reviving its "trilateral 
initiative" mediation efforts between Chad and Sudan, 
starting with eliminating support for proxy rebel groups, as 
a prelude to helping to solve the Darfur problem, according 
to Libya's once and current Ambassador to Chad, Greene Saleh 
Greene, who had conversations with Ambassador April 14 and 
¶15.  Greene stressed that Libya was uniquely qualified by 
propinquity, motivation, regional expertise and experience to 
intervene successfully to (a) end the Chad-Sudan proxy wars 
by detaching NDjamena and Khartoum from Sudanese and Chad 
rebel groups, respectively; (b) restore regional stability by 
reconciling Deby and Bashir; and (c) take on resolution of 
the crisis in Darfur itself. 
 
--------------- 
THE LIBYAN EDGE 
--------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Greene, accompanied by outgoing CDA Shlback as 
interpreter, said Libya's recently enhanced international 
role would not divert Tripoli's attention from neighboring 
Darfur, where Libya's long experience and connections gave 
its diplomacy maximum traction.  Greene said that his 
position as part of Guide Qadhafi's own ethnic group as well 
as his prior service as Ambassador to Chad would enable him 
to leverage Libya's influence in Chad and among Chad rebels. 
As for Darfur, "We know the tribes, we know the Walis, we 
know the issues," Greene claimed.  Greene said that the 
current gathering of AU FORMINs in Tripoli would give Libyan 
diplomacy an opportunity to re-launch its efforts (REFTEL). 
"We will do another Sirte accord for Chad rebels and we will 
work on the Sudanese rebels, too," Greene asserted.  Greene 
made clear that reconciliation between the Sudan rebels and 
GoS, on the one hand, and Chad rebels and GoC, on the other, 
would be the first and perhaps the most difficult obstacle to 
overcome, but was a necessary first step.  The Chad rebels 
wanted too much, but they would have to be given something, 
according to Greene.  A lot of what the rebel leaders wanted 
was personal power, but that would be too much, he said.

PREDICTS NO CHAD 
REBEL ATTACKS 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Greene was very clear in asserting that "there 
would be no Chad rebel offensive this year." because the 
world was watching Sudan too closely for Khartoum to unleash 
its Chadian proxies.  On the other hand, Greene offered that 
President Bashir's ICC indictment had rendered a difficult 
situation much worse. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  The diplomatic program Greene outlined was familiar 
and familiarly grandiose.  Nevertheless, Greene's arrival 
here is welcome, if only -- given his personal stature and 
prior experience here -- as a testament of Libyan intention 
to remain engaged in the Chad-Sudan embroglio.  Greene's 
repetition of long-standing Libyan commitment to a 
"trilateral track" to ending the Sudan-Chad standoff, 
starting by detaching rebel groups from their state sponsors, 
is welcome too, coinciding as it does with USG objectives in 
the region.  That Greene speaks neither French nor English 
serviceably will make dealing with him less facile than with 
his active, voluble, and very approachable predecessor, CDA 
Emhemmed Shlback, who remains here temporarily to smooth

BIO INFO

¶5.  (SBU)  Greene, who may actually have been born in Chad to 
Libyan parents, served as Libya's Ambassador to Chad from 
1996 to 2004, before and after which we understand that he 
was governor of Sebha province.  Previous to that, he held 
many provincial-level positions.  We do not know his exact 
relationship to Qadhafi, but will try to fill in gaps in our 
knowledge of him.  We would appreciate any insights or 
information that Embassy Tripoli might have.
