SUBJECT: DEFENSE MINISTER KAMP BLASTS CHAVEZ IN PARLIAMENT 
 
¶1. (U) Defense Minister Kamp blasted Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chavez in parliamentary hearings March 9.  Addressing 
Dutch coast guard operations in the Netherlands Antilles, 
Kamp called Chavez a populist with lots of money who "casts 
big eyes on the morsels along the coast of Venezuela that 
form part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands."  He said the 
Netherlands had nothing to fear, as the Venezuelans had only 
one functioning warship and could not hope to best the Dutch 
armed forces.  Kamp acknowledged that Chavez intended to 
build up his military forces but added the Netherlands 
intended to prevent this through diplomatic and political 
means. 
 
¶2. (U) Although Kamp's comments reflect remarks we have heard 
from others - primarily in the Ministry of Defense and 
Ministry of Interior - they do not reflect the views at MFA, 
which prefers to engage rather than isolate Chavez.  Kamp's 
remarks should not be seen as representing a change in the 
GONL's official public stance.
