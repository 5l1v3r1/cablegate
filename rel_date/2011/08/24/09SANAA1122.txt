(SBU) PolOff delivered reftel demarche to Adil Dabwan, 
trafficking in persons expert at the Ministry of Social 
Affairs and Labor on June 15.  Dabwan promised to discuss 
Yemen's Tier 2 ) Watch List ranking with the Minister of 
Social Affairs and Labor, and expressed his appreciation for 
the early notification.  Dabwan acknowledged that the ROYG 
must pass legislation criminalizing trafficking of persons - 
currently being discussed in Parliament - as well as work to 
better identify and provide services for victims of 
trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation.  He expressed 
his personal hope that the downgrade in Yemen's ranking would 
provide the impetus for the ROYG to "finally complete this 
important action."
