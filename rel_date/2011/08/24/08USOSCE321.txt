SUBJECT: CORRECTED COPY: CFE/CSBM: ANNUAL EXCHANGE OF 
INFORMATION FOR 2009 
 
REF: STATE 129922 
 
¶1. (SBU) CORRECTED COPY.  Summary.  (This cable correctly 
reports, in paras 1 and 5, how much some of Azerbaijan's 
declared holdings exceed CFE Treaty limits.)  Annual 
exchanges of information under the CFE Treaty and the Vienna 
Document, with information effective January 1, 2009, were 
held in Vienna on December 12-15, 2008.  Both achieved high 
levels of participation.  The electronic exchange, with 
support provided by the United States, also reached a high 
participation level.  As expected, Russia did not provide its 
CFE data. Azerbaijan's declared holdings continue to exceed 
its Treaty limits, this year by 161 Battle Tanks and by 119 
artillery pieces (see para 5).  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) CFE Treaty:  Required hard-copy information was 
provided by 27 of the 30 States Parties.  As expected, Russia 
did not provide its data (see para 4) and Mission is awaiting 
Iceland's nil report.  Belarus for the first time failed to 
provide hardcopy data, although they did provide data in the 
electronic exchange.  USDEL queried a Belarus rep on this 
omission after the FSC meeting on December 17, who explained 
that they were having "technical problems" and hoped to have 
the hardcopy data provided by early the next week.  Georgia 
delivered its hard-copy information late because of what it 
termed "technical delays."  With the exception of Russia, 
Iceland, and Georgia, all States Parties participated in the 
automated exchange. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Vienna Document 1999:  Information was submitted in 
hard copy by 44 participating States; 45 participated in the 
electronic exchange.  In addition, diplomatic notes conveying 
nil reports are on hand from Iceland and Canada. NOTE: Nil 
reports are still pending from Andorra, Liechtenstein, 
Monaco, San Marino and the Holy See. END NOTE.  Of those with 
military forces, data have not yet been submitted by 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Russia:  Based on its "suspension" of implementation 
of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), 
Russia again failed to provide its information as of January 
1, 2009 on its force structure, armaments, and personnel as 
required during the annual exchange of data by the CFE 
Treaty.  Russia did, however, provide the information 
required by the Vienna Document, which is significantly less 
detailed.  The U.S., NATO States Parties, Georgia, Moldova, 
and Ukraine provided information to all CFE States Parties, 
including Russia.  As it did last year, Russia continues to 
exclude the BRM-1K armored vehicle from Vienna Document 
reporting, while all other holders continue to declare them 
as AIFVs. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Azerbaijan:  Azerbaijan's declared holdings exceed 
its Treaty limits by 161 Battle Tanks, compared to 99 over 
limit last year, and by 119 artillery pieces, compared to 64 
over limit last year. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Fourteen OSCE participating States have provided 
their Global Exchange of Information (GEMI) data for 2009, 
which is due in April 2009.
