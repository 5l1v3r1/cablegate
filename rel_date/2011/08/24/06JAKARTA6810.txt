Â¶1.  We delivered a diplomatic note to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs on April 28 designating all U.S. air 
carriers as authorized carriers under the Open Skies 
Agreement between the United States and Indonesia (reftel). 
We also discussed the purpose of the designation with Lilien 
Ambarwiyati, Deputy Director, International Air Transport, 
Directorate General for Air Communication, Ministry of 
Communication, and delivered to her a copy of the diplomatic 
note and talking points.  Ambarwiyati is the lead GOI 
official with responsibility for the Open Skies Agreement. 
We told Ambarwiyati the United States is prepared to accept 
a similar designation from Indonesia.  She said she would 
review the proposal and discuss it with MOC officials.
