SUBJECT: REQUEST TO DEFER TRAVEL TO SINGAPORE OCTOBER 1 
THROUGH NOVEMBER 16, 2009 
 
¶1.  Singapore will be hosting the INTERPOL General 
Assembly 
October 11-15 and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) Leaders' Week November 8-15.  The White House has 
announced that the President will visit Singapore to 
attend 
the APEC Leaders' Meeting to be held November 14-15. 
 
¶2.  Embassy Singapore staff will be fully engaged in 
supporting these events and will have limited ability to 
provide routine visitor support services during October 
and 
November.  Post requests that all non-essential official 
travel to Singapore be deferred from October 1, 2009 
until 
after November 16, 2009. 
 
¶3.  Hotel accommodations in Singapore will be scarce 
during 
October and November and rates will likely be well above 
normal per diem lodging costs.  The Embassy cannot 
guarantee availability unless visitors are part of the 
official APEC or INTERPOL General Assembly delegations.
