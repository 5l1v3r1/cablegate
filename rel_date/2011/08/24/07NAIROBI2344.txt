CONCERNS IN MOGADISHU 
 
NAIROBI 00002344  001.2 OF 003 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  Reports from humanitarian agencies 
highlight grave humanitarian protection concerns in 
Mogadishu.  Key issues include ongoing violent attacks, 
unexploded ordnance (UXO), and evictions from public 
buildings.  While the Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the UN Children?s 
Fund (UNICEF) are actively monitoring and reporting on 
violations, insecurity and limited access is hindering 
the implementation of protection programs.  USAID?s 
Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and 
State/PRM, are supporting protection monitoring efforts 
through UNHCR and UNICEF.  Septel will address 
humanitarian access status.  End summary. 
 
ONGOING VIOLENCE 
 
¶2.  Despite the cessation of major military operations 
in Mogadishu, civilians continue to suffer collateral 
damage and injury from insurgent and counterinsurgent 
activities.  UN?s Department of Safety and Security 
reports at least one security incident, ranging from 
hand grenade explosions to road side bombs, each day. 
Medical facilities continue to receive civilians with 
weapon-related wounds. 
 
UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE 
 
¶3.  Heavy fighting between insurgents and TFG and 
Ethiopian troops in Mogadishu in March and April left 
an unknown quantity of UXO scattered throughout the 
city.  The UN World Health Organization (WHO) and 
UNICEF report an increase in UXO-related injuries at 
health facilities as the fighting subsided and people 
began transiting through the city again.  According to 
UNICEF, children are the most at risk of injury as they 
are often unaware of the threat.  On May 5, two 
children were killed and eight others injured when a 
UXO that they were playing with exploded.  A similar 
incident occurred on May 27, injuring seven children. 
 
¶4.  Humanitarian agencies are emphasizing the need for 
UXO removal and mine risk education (MRE) activities. 
Due to insecurity and limited access, humanitarian 
organizations have been unable to carry out a full 
assessment of the threat of UXOs.  As access improves, 
however, the Danish Demining Group (DDG), which has 
experience with demining in Somaliland, is planning a 
four-week assessment to determine the extent of the 
problem in Mogadishu.  DDG hopes to begin the survey in 
June, security permitting.  UNICEF, UNHCR and UNDP will 
participate in the assessment and help prepare a plan 
of action for a six-month program. 
 
¶5.  In addition, UNICEF has begun broadcasting UXO 
awareness radio spots through Horn Afrique in 
Mogadishu.  UNICEF is also bringing in surplus MRE 
materials from a program implemented by Handicap 
International in Somaliland. 
 
¶6.  UNHCR and UNICEF reported that discussions are 
underway with the African Union Mission to Somalia 
(AMISOM) to identify potential UXO clearance and MRE 
activities within the mission?s mandate.  UNHCR also 
said that the UN Mine Action Service has been requested 
to assist in UXO clearance and awareness in Somalia. 
 
EVICTIONS FROM PUBLIC BUILDINGS 
 
 
NAIROBI 00002344  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
¶7.  According to UNHCR, nearly 250,000 internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) were residing in Mogadishu 
prior to the recent fighting, some of which have lived 
as squatters on government property for the last 15 
years.  In an effort to re-establish government offices 
in Mogadishu, the TFG recently announced that IDPs will 
not be allowed to occupy government-owned buildings and 
land.  Those who are currently in the buildings will be 
evicted and those who fled the city during the recent 
fighting will not be allowed to return to domicile in 
government-owned buildings. 
 
¶8.  The TFG has reportedly established a committee to 
address the internal resettlement of people who are 
unable to return to their prior residence.  However, 
UNHCR, which is the lead agency for the Somalia 
Protection Cluster, reports no evidence that the 
committee is operational.  Furthermore, UNHCR noted 
that there is currently no clear point of contact 
within the TFG on this issue, with four separate 
entities demanding to be consulted on IDP issues:  the 
Mayor of Mogadishu, the National Refugee Committee, the 
Office of the Prime Minister, and the newly established 
but not yet operational evictions committee.  Despite 
the four entities claiming to have a role, none have 
responded to UNHCR?s requests for a resettlement plan. 
 
PROTECTION MONITORING EFFORTS 
 
¶9.  Protection is an important component of OFDA?s 
mandate and Somalia strategy.  OFDA-funded programs 
mainstream protection into traditional sector 
activities to reduce the risk and extent of harm to 
civilians.  In addition, OFDA ? along with State/PRM - 
supports stand-alone protection programs like UNHCR and 
UNICEF?s protection monitoring systems in Somalia.  So 
far in FY 2007, USAID?s Office of US Foreign Disaster 
Assistance (OFDA) has provided $575,000 to UNICEF for 
child protection activities and plans to provide 
approximately $300,000 to UNHCR for IDP protection 
programs. 
 
¶10.  Insecurity remains a key impediment for UNICEF and 
UNHCR in Somalia.  While active in monitoring and 
advocacy through implementing partners, UNICEF and 
UNHCR hope to become more operational in the protection 
sector as security and access improve.  Both agencies 
note that monitoring provides a clearer picture of the 
protection environment; however, insecurity continues 
to hinder prevention of abuses. 
 
UNICEF CHILD PROTECTION MONITORING 
 
¶11.  UNICEF is mandated by UN Security Council 
Resolution 1612 to monitor and report on child rights 
violations in Somalia.  UNICEF has trained nearly 40 
child protection monitors from 20 non-governmental 
organizations to assist in this effort.  These monitors 
utilize a standard method for reporting violations to 
UNICEF which inputs the information into a database. 
The information is analyzed and presented to the UN 
Security Council on a regular basis. 
 
¶12.  In addition, UNICEF supports a network of child 
protection advocates throughout the country.  The 
network is comprised of 32 two-person teams trained by 
UNICEF.  Teams visit a community for two to three weeks 
during which time the team conducts a protection 
 
NAIROBI 00002344  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
survey, carries out child rights education, and assists 
in setting up community-based protection programs.  The 
team returns to the community on a bi-annual basis to 
provide follow-up support. 
 
UNHCR PROTECTION MONITORING NETWORK 
 
¶13.  As the lead agency for protection issues under the 
UN Cluster System, UNHCR leads monthly protection 
cluster meetings in Nairobi and manages the Protection 
Monitoring Network (PMN), which tracks protection 
incidents through partners on the ground.  UNHCR 
obtains information regarding human rights violations 
and the humanitarian condition of populations of 
concern, such as IDPs and refugees, through various 
sources, including local media, hospitals, and local 
partners.  Currently, 32 partner organizations provide 
information to UNHCR for the weekly PMN reports that 
coincide with the agency?s Population Movement Tracking 
reports.  These reports have provided essential 
information to the humanitarian community for 
programming and advocacy activities. 
 
¶14.  UNHCR has trained 18 local NGOs to increase 
awareness of human rights issues and to inform victims 
of violations of the various response mechanisms that 
are available to them.  UNHCR is also training Somalis 
to become trainers on protection concerns in an effort 
to expand awareness and mobilize government officials, 
and traditional and religious leaders on human rights. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
¶15.  Protection remains a major concern in the fragile 
political/military context of Mogadishu.  UN and other 
efforts to monitor protection violations are 
increasing, but efforts to prevent them are in the 
early stages.  They will depend on continuing 
improvement in the security situation and increased 
access by humanitarian agencies.
