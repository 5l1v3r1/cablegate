SUBJECT: SE GRATION MEETS WITH INGOs WORKING IN THE THREE AREAS 
 
¶1. (SBU) On the morning of April 6 in Juba, Presidential Special 
Envoy to Sudan Scott Gration met with seven INGOs working in the 
"Three Areas" on the border between northern and northern Sudan. 
PADCO, Mercy Corps, NDI, IRI, Save the Children and Goal all 
complained of constant bureaucratic obstacles thrown in their way by 
authorities in the North that interfere with their ability to 
operate in these regions. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The seven INGOs outlined for the SE the wide range of 
humanitarian and civic education programs they operate in the states 
of Southern Kordofan, Abyei and Blue Nile, commonly referred to as 
the "Three Areas" on the border between northern and southern Sudan. 
 The NGOs explained that they have to contend with authorities from 
both the northern and southern governments, creating confusion over 
who controls their work.  The recent expulsion of 13 INGOs by the 
GOS has crippled INGO operations not only in Darfur but also in the 
Three Areas.  Many of the organizations said that while the attempt 
was made to seize their assets in the Three Areas as was done in 
Darfur, the SPLM was able to stop that, although their assets were, 
in many cases, locked up. 
 
¶3. (SBU) All complained of constant problems in their dealings with 
the Government of Sudan, which constantly finds ways to harass them 
with what they called, "bimps," or bureaucratic impediments.  This 
included such things as requiring travel permits that they do not 
actually need, difficulties in getting visas, and impediments to 
importing equipment and supplies that sit for months awaiting 
clearances.  As one NGO reported, the NCP "doesn't want us there 
helping those people."  Major hospital and school building projects 
now sit uncompleted.  The intent, they thought, was to foster 
dissatisfaction with the SPLM by blaming them for the lack 
education, health and other services in these states. 
 
¶4. (SBU) NDI outlined the polling work they have done across the 
South.  On the question of independence for the South in 2011, NDI's 
polling shows consistently high overwhelming support in the South 
for breaking away from the North.  Asked by the SE if there was any 
movement at all in public opinion in favor of unity, NDI replied 
that there has been almost no support for unity in the last four 
years that they have been sampling public opinion.  While there has 
been a 2 percent rise in support for unity in the last year, 
approximately 95 percent still support independence. 
 
¶5. (SBU) All the INGOs agreed that inter-tribal tensions are 
increasing across the South, and are liable to grow even worse as 
the southern economy suffers from the effects of the world financial 
crisis.  This will likely cause the economy of southern Sudan to 
contract at the very time that the populace is expecting to see 
peace dividends, increasing competition for scarce resources. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: SE Gration's agreement with the GOS on the 
resumption of INGO programs should restore almost 100 percent of the 
lost programming in the Three Areas, if it is implemented in good 
faith by Khartoum.  However as these INGOs note, the GOS is a past 
expert in obstructing programs with bureaucratic impediments, so 
measuring the implementation of the agreement by the GOS will be 
just as important as the agreement itself.  End comment. 
 
¶7. (U) SE Gration reviewed this message before transmission.
