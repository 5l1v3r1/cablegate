cost of the repairs will be $800 for the forklift and $32,000 for 
the crane.

 BMTF Mentors stationed at Islam Qualah and Towr Kham Border 
Crossing Points (BCPs) have provided training on Busters and 
assorted inspection tools.  The Mentors will train Customs and 
Border Police Officers assigned to the ports on the equipment and 
then turn the equipment over to Customs.  Like kind inspection 
equipment is being planned for the Border Police stationed at the 
BCPs.  On the more technical equipment, subject matter experts will 
be required to conduct training on the radiation and metal 
detection/identification devices.  Once a source for this training 
has been identified and the training completed, this equipment can 
be fielded immediately.  The EXBS office continues to work with 
ISN/ECC to find an acceptable source for this training.  Getting the 
equipment out to the BCPs is a top EXBS priority. 
 
KABUL 00002829  003 OF 003 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) The Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) provided the 
Embassy with an official notice stating that it welcomes the 
assistance of the Embassy and EXBS in developing a new Export 
Control Law (Strategic Goods Act).   This law, based on European 
Union (EU) models of similar laws, will incorporate control lists 
and provide the legal foundation to institutionalize controls on the 
movement of weapons of mass destruction and their precursors.  EXBS 
provided funds to translate a version of a model EU law into Dari. 
The model EU law will serve as a starting point for the MoCI to 
draft its Strategic Goods bill.  Other key stake holders such as the 
Ministry of Finance (Customs) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
have expressed their commitments to getting this draft legislation 
completed. 
This project will build capacity for the Afghan government in the 
area of non-proliferation controls and will provide a legal 
foundation for the use of international Control Lists and Import, 
Export and Transshipment controls for the movement of Weapons of 
Mass Destruction.  The new hardware and software will automate their 
current license control system.  This effort will include a database 
that can efficiently manage licensing approvals as well as give the 
law enforcement community better visibility of the movement of all 
shipments in and out of Afghanistan.  ISN/ECC is in the process of 
scheduling this assistance. 
 
¶3. (U) The United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear 
Security Administration (DOE/NNSA) Global Threat Reduction 
Initiative (GTRI) planned to hold a training program on the recovery 
of orphaned radioactive sources.  The training for 25 Afghan 
Government officials was scheduled to be held in Tashkent, 
Uzbekistan the second week in December in conjunction with a similar 
course for Uzbek Government officials.  Unfortunately the Uzbek 
Government has declined the training request.  The training will 
have to be rescheduled in another country. 
 
 
III. RED FLAG ISSUES: 
 
¶1. (U) No Red Flag Issues to report.
