¶1.  (SBU) Energy Minister Yuriy Boyko announced on October 11 that 
Ukraine had pumped 25.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas 
into its underground storage facilities.  The amount, according to 
Boyko, was sufficient to both guarantee steady gas transit to Europe 
and meet increased domestic demand this winter. (Note: NaftoHaz told 
us in July (ref c) that in fall 2005 they had 24 bcm in storage; in 
other years the reserves have been even lower, e.g., 17 bcm in 
2001.) Boyko added that state oil and gas monopoly NaftoHaz owned 6 
bcm of the stored gas, while RosUkrEnergo owned 10 bcm and the 
NaftoHaz-RosUkrEnergo joint venture UkrHazEnergo owned 6 bcm.  The 
balance belonged to other gas traders, the State Reserve Committee, 
and the Finance Ministry.  (Note: The timing of Boyko's announcement 
was significant, as it came just days before October 15, which is 
the end of the 6-month gas storage fill season and the start of the 
winter heating season.  During winter, gas stores are drawn down to 
supply Ukraine's antiquated communal heating system and other 
household gas users.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  NaftoHaz withdrew 6.2 bcm from storage last 
winter during December and January alone to supply Ukrainian 
consumers, according to industry data.  That raises the question of 
whether Naftohaz's 6 bcm will be sufficient for the entire 2006/7 
winter heating season, which runs from October 15 - April 15.  On 
the one hand, last year NaftoHaz was also supplying industrial 
users, while this year UkrHazEnergo largely covers that sector.  On 
the other hand, the extra gas needed from storage is largely for 
household heating.  If the 6 bcm is not enough, NaftoHaz likely will 
be dependent on purchases from RosUkrEnergo and UkrHazEnergo to meet 
Ukraine's domestic gas needs.  We have no indication that NaftoHaz 
has agreed with either company on a price, so they could face high 
spot prices.  Financially strapped due to higher imported gas prices 
and alleged mismanagement, NaftoHaz in turn would likely have to 
take out loans to purchase additional winter gas, if needed, or 
resort to siphoning.  Mention of these options, for now, is being 
studiously avoided by both the Ministry of Energy and the Ukrainian 
press.
