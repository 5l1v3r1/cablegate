GOL RESUMES COLLECTING 
GAS EXCISE TAX 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On October 30, the GOL resumed the collection of gasoline 
excise taxes, suspended while oil prices surged, following the 
recent fall in international oil prices.  Because the tax fluctuates 
based on the price of oil, a continued price drop will bring in much 
needed additional revenues to the GOL, helping reduce the deficit. 
Reinstating the gas excise tax was one of the IMF's Emergency Post 
Conflict Assistance (EPCA) -- as well as USG -- benchmarks for the 
disbursement of Paris III pledged budgetary support in 2007, but 
with the hike in oil prices, the government chose to forego such a 
measure for political and social considerations.  The current 
collection level would not meet the EPCA condition, though it will 
bring some improvement in government finances. 
 
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY 
ELIMINATES WHEAT SUBSIDY 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following a meeting on October 31 between the Minister of 
Economy and Trade Mohammad Safadi and representatives of mills and 
bakeries, the Ministry decided to cancel its wheat subsidy 
completely.  According to the head of the Directorate of Sugar Beets 
and Grains at the Ministry of Economy and Trade (MOET) Claire Amm, 
the subsidy had been implemented when the international price of one 
ton of wheat exceeded $210, whereas it is currently below $200.  In 
addition to this, the decrease in the prices of fuel makes the 
subsidy unjustified.  Amm noted that bakeries and the General Labor 
Confederation had been lobbying the MOET to eliminate the subsidy. 
 
 
MARONITE CHURCH INVOLVED IN 
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Former Finance Minister Jihad Azour told us he is setting 
up a $50-100 million investment fund for the Maronite Church to 
invest in SMEs in Lebanon.  Azour, who will chair the fund, is 
currently designing a strategy and assembling a team for this 
project.  Azour also mentioned that he is working with the Maronite 
Church on other related initiatives to help mainly Christian 
companies in Lebanon and to promote job creation.  Azour said he is 
occasionally helping PM Siniora on economic issues, and is part of 
Majority Leader Saad Hariri's advisory group on economic and social 
strategy.   (Comment:  Azour, a Maronite from north Lebanon and 
nephew of former Minister/MP Jean Obeid, still has political 
ambitions.  End comment.) 
 
ALPHA MOBILE OPERATOR 
TO EXPAND ITS NETWORK 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The Ministry of Telecommunications (MOT) announced that 
cellular operator Alpha signed an eight million dollar contract to 
expand its network to accommodate 300,000 new users, as well as 
improve the quality and coverage of its network.  Mobile operator 
MTC Touch has also completed a $645,000 expansion of its network in 
the southern regions of Marjeyoun and Khiam. 
 
INVESTMENT AND FINANCE CONFERENCE 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) There will be a "Friends of Lebanon Conference for 
Investment and Finance" on November 20-21, 2008 in Beirut.  The 
conference organizing firm has sent invitations to officials in the 
 
BEIRUT 00001569  002 OF 002 
 
 
Gulf and other countries; PM Siniora and Central Bank Governor 
Salameh are inviting their counterparts.  Siniora reportedly invited 
Egypt's PM while he was in Cairo last week.  The French PM will be 
in Lebanon during this period with a business delegation.  The 
French Embassy told us they were not pleased that this larger 
conference at which the French PM is supposed to participate has 
been arranged, apparently with GOL approval, to coincide with that 
visit. 
 
LEBANON IS OIL-IMPORTER LEAST LIKELY 
TO SUFFER FROM GLOBAL CRISIS 
-------------------- 
¶6. (U) According to regional investment bank EFG Hermes, Lebanon is 
the oil-importing economy least likely to suffer from falling global 
demand outside the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, 
resulting from the global financial crisis.  Lebanon's domestic 
demand growth will also not be as affected by rising inflation as in 
other oil-importing economies, as demand is expected to pick up in 
2008 and 2009, due to perceptions that the political situation has 
improved.  The current account balance is also expected to improve, 
benefiting from falling oil prices, EFG Hermes noted. 
 
EIU LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST FOR 2009, EFFECT OF 
GLOBAL CRISIS COULD BE FELT WHEN ISSUING BONDS 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) In its first report since the worsening of the global 
financial crisis, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) estimated 
Lebanon's real GDP growth at 4.2 percent in 2008, and revised 
downward its 2009 GDP forecast from 4.6 percent to 3.1 percent, due 
to the spillover from the economic slowdown and political 
uncertainty tied to the 2009 parliamentary elections.  Meanwhile, 
the EIU expressed fears that the global liquidity freeze could 
increase pressure on the GOL, which needs both to turn over a large 
volume of local and foreign currency debt instruments on a regular 
basis, and to take on new debt to finance its budget deficit. 
Therefore, said the EIU, the global loss of confidence is likely to 
be felt when Lebanon returns to the Eurobond market with a new 
issue.
