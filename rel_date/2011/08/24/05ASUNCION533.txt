SUBJECT: PARAGUAY WILL NOT SUPPORT RESOLUTION ON GUANTANAMO 
 
REF: STATE 69823 
 
On 4/19, PolCoun drew from reftel points in conveying to 
Julio Duarte, the MFA's Human Rights Director, U.S. concerns 
about the resolution introduced by Cuba on Guantanamo. 
Duarte affirmed that Paraguay similarly viewed this 
resolution as unconstructive and politically motivated. 
Paraguay had not decided yet whether it would abstain or vote 
against the resolution but supporting it was not/not an 
option.  Duarte conjectured the resolution could ultimately 
be pulled as occurred last year.
