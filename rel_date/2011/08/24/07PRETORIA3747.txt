¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: South Africa's Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) 
new nuclear technology will play a key role in the SAG decision to 
significantly increase nuclear power generation in the country over 
the next 20 years.  The country will face challenges in securing 
skills and investment to implement its ambitious program.  PBMR is a 
leading contender for high-temperature, gas-cooled Next Generation 
Nuclear Plants, in cooperation with Westinghouse and the DOE Idaho 
National Laboratory.  Embassy joined an Idaho National Laboratory 
mission to check the status of PBMR.   End Summary.

Our Smart Nuclear Guys Talk to Their Smart Guys 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Energy Officer and Energy Specialist joined a delegation 
from the DOE Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to visit test 
facilities of the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) on October 19 
and 22.  INL is working on the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) 
and Generation IV nuclear reactor for which PBMR is a leading 
contender because of high efficiency, attractive economics, modular 
size, and enhanced passive safety features. 
 
¶3.  (U) The PBMR is a High Temperature Reactor (HTR) with a 
closed-cycle, gas turbine power conversion system.  The fuel 
consists of low enriched uranium triple-coated "kernels" contained 
in molded graphite spheres, the so-called "pebbles".  Each fuel 
pebble contains 9 grams of nine percent uranium-235.   About 450,000 
of these tennis-ball-sized spheres circulate through the reactor. 
Helium coolant circulates among the reacting spheres and heats up to 
a temperature of 900 degrees centigrade in order to remove the heat 
generated by the nuclear reaction.  The heated gas drives a 
power-turbine-compressor to generate electricity and then passes 
through a high efficiency recuperator.  PBMR is designed to be 
inherently safe with passive features that assure no danger of 
overheating, meltdown, or release of fissile materials. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The host of the INL visit, PBMR Chief Technology Officer 
Dr. Johan Slabber, was an early champion of the vision of acquiring 
the pebble bed technology from the Germans, eventually convincing 
state electricity company Eskom to form PBMR Ltd in 2000.  Current 
investors are the South African Government (SAG), Eskom, the 
Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) of South Africa, and 
Westinghouse, which took over the 15 percent share previously held 
by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL).  Original investor U.S. firm Exelon 
ended its investment for strategic reasons. 
 
----------------------------------- 
South African Government Commitment 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The South African Government has embraced ambitious plans 
to double its electricity capacity from current 42,000 MW to 82,000 
MW by 2025, documented by publication of its draft nuclear energy 
policy and reassessment of its overall energy policy (reftels).  In 
addition, 25 percent of total capacity will be generated by nuclear 
power.  This will constitute about 18,000 MW of nuclear new-build, 
of which Westinghouse and Areva of France are competing for the 
first tranche of 3,000 MW (reftel B).  If realized, South Africa's 
new nuclear build will represent 17 percent of the world's 
anticipated nuclear new build over the same period.  The SAG is 
contemplating PBMR technology for up to 5,000 MW of its nuclear new 
build.  The SAG's nuclear energy policy is also premised on 
beneficiating its prodigious uranium reserves, about 10 percent of 
the world's supply, as well as maintaining security of fuel supply 
by considering developing fuel enrichment capability.  Despite the 
huge investment contemplated, South Africa has significant existing 
infrastructure with one nuclear power plant, a respected National 
Nuclear Regulator (NNR), the Nuclear Energy Company of South Africa 
(NECSA) at Pelindaba, waste disposal facilities, and extensive 
expertise and training capacity.

¶6.  (SBU) The Embassy/INL team visited PBMR test facilities at 
Northwest University and M-Tech in Potschefstroom on October 19. 
These included the Pebble Bed Micro Model, the Heat Transfer Test 
Facility (high pressure and high temperature testing of thermal 
properties of gas coolant), and hydrogen hub testing.  The team 
visited additional PBMR testing facilities at NECSA-Pelindaba near 
Pretoria on October 22.  The pilot fuel plant and kernel laboratory 
is engaged in detailed research and analysis of the pebble spheres. 
Chief Technology Officer Dr. Johan Slabber said he expects to 
imminently secure the license to allow them to use uranium instead 
of zirconium for testing.  The Helium Test Facility is a full-scale 
facility for testing the circulation of the pebble spheres within 
high temperature helium gas.  This facility was constructed by South 
African nuclear supplier company IST-Nuclear, which was recently 
acquired by Westinghouse.  IST-Nuclear will become Westinghouse 
Electric S.A. on November 1. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Pelindaba is also the former site of South Africa's 
weapons and uranium enrichment program, voluntarily dismantled in 
the late 1980's.  The SAG has since signed and adhered to all 
non-proliferation conventions.  The SAG is in the process of 
converting the existing Safari Research Reactor at Pelindaba from 
high enriched uranium to low enriched uranium.  The highly secure 
Pelindaba facility declined in the years following decommissioning 
of the weapons facilities, but PBMR is participating in a 
renaissance of the facility. 
 
------------------- 
Next Steps for PBMR 
------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) PBMR aims to develop and market small-scale modular 
high-temperature reactors both in South Africa and internationally. 
Since 2004, the SAG has allocated significant funding to the project 
and Minister of Public Enterprises Alec Erwin has voiced the SAG 
intent to develop up to 5,000 MW of PBMR reactors in the country 
(perhaps 20-30 PBMR reactors of 165 MW each).  The company plans to 
begin construction of the demonstration reactor project at Koeberg 
near Cape Town in 2009 for operation in 2013.  PBMR is working 
closely with the national regulator NNR for staged licensing of 
construction/installation, fuel loading, operation, and 
decommissioning.  The PBMR design, materials, and construction 
replicate previous German engineering in order to expedite 
regulatory approval.  Demo plant client Eskom is completing a 
comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), subsequent to 
the Cape High Court ruling in favor of anti-nuclear Earthlife Africa 
to set aside an older approved EIA.  PBMR officials are confident 
that building the demo plant will not face further delays, noting 
that South Africa's public is not generally opposed to nuclear 
power. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) COMMENT: The PBMR team takes great pride in the importance 
of their work and how it fits into South African economic 
development.  Like both Eskom and Sasol, the company plans to staff 
up significantly, from current 1,000 employees to 5,000 staff.  As 
remarked recently by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, South Africa 
faces a skills shortage.  Department of Minerals and Energy Chief 
Director: Nuclear Tseliso Maqubela recently told Economic Counselor 
that South Africa hopes to regain South African nuclear engineers 
working in the U.S. (i.e., at DOE facilities).  On the other hand, 
the Embassy/INL team was struck by the knowledge and enthusiasm of a 
number of young black post-grad technicians at PBMR test facilities, 
supplementing the generally older white scientists.  There is a 
shortage of nuclear engineering skills in South Africa and the 
situation will worsen as many older engineers are expected to retire 
over the next ten years.  The targeted massive increase in 
electricity investment and supply is coming at a critical moment for 
Eskom, which faces capacity shortfalls, a slim reserve margin, and 
the need to periodically practice "load-shedding" due to 
under-investment in electricity capacity, partly because of past 
delays in SAG plans for new plants.  Now there is full agreement 
between the SAG and the private sector of the need to move forward 
quickly.
