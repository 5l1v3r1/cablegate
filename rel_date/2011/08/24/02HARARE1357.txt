SUBJECT: PRO-GOVERNMENT MEDIA COMMISSION NAMED 
 
 
¶1.   On June 1 Information Minister Jonathan Moyo 
    appointed a six-member Media and Information Commission 
    to license media organizations, accredit journalists, 
    and assume other functions related to controlling the 
    media in Zimbabwe.  The Media and Information 
    Commission is a statutory body mandated by the Access 
    to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA). 
    Moyo named Dr. Tafataona Mahoso, head of the journalism 
    department at Harare Polytechnic and strong supporter 
    of the Mugabe administration and media control, as 
    executive chairman of the Commission.  Moyo also named 
    two former editors of state-controlled newspapers -- 
    Pascal Mukondiwa, former editor of the "Sunday Mail" 
    and Jonathan Maphenduka, former assistant editor of the 
    "Chronicle" -- to the panel.  Other Commission members 
    include retired Information Ministry official Alpinos 
    Makoni; Dr. Rino Zhuwara, the head of Media Studies at 
    the University of Zimbabwe, and Mr. Sephath Mlambo, the 
    principal of the government-run Mkoba Teachers' 
    College.  All members have been appointed for three 
    years. 
 
¶2.   In a statement released on June 1, the government 
    said the Commission was set up to ensure that "all 
    Zimbabweans enjoy improved access to information and 
    achieve effective ownership and control of mass media 
    services in the country."  The Commission would also 
    "enforce professional and ethical standards in the 
    media industry, as well as mount investigations and 
    inquiries on media conduct." 
 
¶3.   The Zimbabwean office of the Media Institute of 
    Southern Africa (MISA) is planning to protest the 
    monolithic, pro-government composition of the 
    Commission.  Media industry leaders, international 
    correspondents and journalists' unions complained that 
    they were not consulted on the appointments. 
 
¶4.   Comment: During AIPPA's tortuous passage through 
    parliament, critics warned that the Commission was 
    likely to be packed with government supporters and 
    become a rubber stamp for Information Minister Moyo's 
    plans for controlling the media in Zimbabwe.  The 
    composition of the Commission's membership confirms 
    those fears and sets up another mechanism for increased 
    government control of all media operating in Zimbabwe.
