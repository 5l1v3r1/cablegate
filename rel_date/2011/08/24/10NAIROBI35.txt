Summary

¶1. (SBU) Per ref B, Post submits the following update for the first 
week of January 2010.  End summary.

PD Activities

¶2. (SBU) The Somalia Unit, including the Military Information 
Support Team (MIST) dedicated to Somalia, performed para. 3-6 
activities since the last report: 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Somalia Unit played a significant role in securing the 
release of VOA Somali Service reporter Mohamed Yasin Isaq, who was 
detained on December 21, 2009, in Puntland.  He was released on 
January 5, 2010, without ever having been charged with a crime. 
Post informed VOA in Washington that Isaq reported to us that he 
feared for his safety.  While this release represents a successful 
resolution in this particular case, we remain engaged with Puntland 
authorities in advocating for protection of journalists in 
Puntland, where the situation of freedom of the press has 
deteriorated in recent months. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Transitional Federal Government's (TFG) Minister of 
Information informed us that TFG-run Radio Mogadishu had gained 
satellite connectivity to Africa, Asia (the Middle East) and 
Europe, with grateful thanks for the U.S. government for the 
December grant of $25,000.  Post once again thanks AF/PD for it 
support for this vitally important initiative. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post assisted World Food Program (WFP) personnel in 
Nairobi with setting up interviews with Somali media to discuss the 
WFP's recent exit from southern Somalia. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) MIST activity: Continued audience analysis for two 
different planned outreach series.
