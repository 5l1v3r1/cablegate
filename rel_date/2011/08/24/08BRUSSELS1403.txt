REF: STATE 93225 
 
(SBU) Pol Off delivered reftel demarche on expanding the 
Afghan National Army to European Commission contacts 
September 5.  Contacts responded that their understanding was 
that the decision had already been made by the Standing 
Committee on Security and would be put to the September 10 
Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board meeting for 
endorsement. While the Commission would not object to the 
expansion, contact raised gerneral concerns about cost and 
sustainability and stressed the need to look at building the 
capacity of other institutions, such as the Ministry of 
Interior, in addition to the ANA.
