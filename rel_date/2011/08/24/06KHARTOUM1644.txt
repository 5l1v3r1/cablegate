SUBJECT:  Southern Sudan:  UNHCR Has Successes, Faces Challenges 
 
 
¶1.  The Director of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees 
(UNHCR) in Southern Sudan, Bhairaja Panday, said that returns from 
Uganda, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) were 
now proceeding smoothly.  However, he explained that returns from 
the Central African Republic (CAR) had been stopped due to the 
closure of the border, and many refugees awaiting return faced 
hardship and food shortages.  Panday also feared that funding 
shortages would threaten UNHCR's long-term ability to effectively 
monitor and assist refugee returns.  (Note:  the UNHCR announced on 
July 10 that 10,000 Sudanese refugees had returned so far in 2006 
from Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, and CAR. End note.) 
 
¶2.  Panday told Embassy PolOff in a meeting on July 7 that he is 
very pleased that UNHCR has now facilitated 10,000 refugee returns. 
While he realized that this is a small portion of the nearly 
half-million refugees, he felt this start was promising, considering 
that the number stood in the hundreds at the beginning of the year. 
He said that refugee returns from Uganda, Kenya, and the DRC, all of 
which had signed tripartite agreements for returns this year, were 
now proceeding well. 
 
¶3.  Returns from the CAR remained a problem because the chartered 
repatriation flight has been grounded since the CAR closed the 
border in April 2006 over fears of Chadian rebel infiltrations. 
This left thousands of stranded refugees awaiting return, many of 
whom sold all their possessions and are facing food shortages 
because they did not plant crops in expectation of an imminent 
departure.  Panday said that the government of the CAR has offered 
the option of an alternative charter company, but the asking price 
is multiples of current charter flights and well above UNHCR's 
budget. 
 
¶4.  Panday also complained that general budget shortfalls will soon 
begin to seriously impact UNHCR's ability to provide services.  He 
said that he had just returned from a meeting in Nairobi where he 
was given a revised, and much reduced, budget.  Because overhead 
costs and staff salaries are fixed, these line items consume a large 
percentage of the overall budget.  This has led to staffing cuts and 
a consolidation of operations to Juba.  The office in Malakal will 
be the first casualty.  Panday is concerned that without staff in 
the field, the UNHCR's ability to accomplish its mission will be 
seriously compromised.
