     (B) BRATISLAVA 430 
 
Â¶1.  (U)  The Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the 
following statement in reaction to the P5 plus 1 meeting 
regarding Iran's nuclear weapons program on June 1.  The 
original text is available in Slovak at www.mzv.sk: 
 
BEGIN UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) of the Slovak Republic 
welcomes the agreement of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs 
of the member states of the Security Council of the UN plus 
Germany about the package of incentives, which will be 
offered to Iran with the condition that it set aside the 
problem of Iran's nuclear program.  The MFA of the Slovak 
Republic considers this proposal a significant step towards 
the renewing of mutual confidence, dialogue and the 
negotiation of a mutually beneficial solution. 
 
The Slovak Republic together with international community 
expects that the Iranian side will accept this appeal 
towards a constructive dialogue on the basis of the 
aforementioned proposal, and will meet the conditions of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the UN 
Security Council. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic in 
this way especially welcomes the decision of the U.S. 
Government to directly participate in negotiations with 
Iranian officials, which is dependent upon the Iranian side 
fully and credibly ending the process of transforming and 
enriching nuclear material.  The MFA of the Slovak Republic 
believes that the role of the USA in negotiations raises the 
chances of reaching an agreement. 
 
The offered package of incentives offers Iran the 
possibility to decide whether it will go down the path of 
dialogue or confrontation.  The MFA of the Slovak Republic 
believes that Iran's leadership will carefully consider the 
proposal and avoid a further deterioration of the situation, 
which would force the international community to adopt 
adequate measures in accordance with the UN charter. 
 
END UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION.
