POSITION 
 
¶1.  EMBASSY BUDAPEST STRONGLY SUPPORTS EMBASSY KABUL'S CALL 
FOR THE ASSIGNMENT OF A US OFFICER TO THE HUNGARIAN PRT IN 
POL-E-KHOMRI. 
 
¶2.  PROMOTING THE SUCCESS OF HUNGARY'S PRT IS AMONG OUR KEY 
BILATERAL PRIORITIES.  TANGIBLE SUCCESS ON THE GROUND IN 
AFGHANISTAN WILL HELP US MAKE THE CASE FOR A CONCERTED GOH 
EFFORT TO FULLY MEET ITS COMMITMENTS AS A NATO ALLY AND TO 
COMPLETE THE TRANSITION FROM CONSUMER TO PROVIDER OF SECURITY 
WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
¶3.  WE BELIEVE THE INVESTMENT OF A DETAILEE CAN MATERIALLY 
ENHANCE THE HUNGARIAN PRT AND, IN TURN, HUNGARY'S CONTINUED 
DEVELOPMENT AS A PARTNER READY, WILLING, AND ABLE TO SUPPORT 
OUR GLOBAL AGENDA.
