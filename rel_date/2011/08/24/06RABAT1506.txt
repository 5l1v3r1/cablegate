SUBJECT: JUSTICE AND INTERIOR MINISTRIES COLLABORATE ON 
ELECTIONS 
 
 ¶1. (U)  On August 4, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and the 
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) signed a joint communique 
expressing their determination to counter any violation of 
the legal conditions of the upcoming Upper House 
parliamentary elections, as reported in all major media 
outlets.  The elections, which are scheduled for September 8, 
will replace one-third of the Upper House's members.  The 
communique reinforces the MOI and MOJ's last joint 
communique, published in August 2003, which listed election 
rules and procedures stipulated in the Lower House organic 
law in hopes of ensuring transparency in the electoral 
process. 
 
¶2. (U)  Public authorities are to present "judicial and 
administrative guarantees" in order to pave the way for 
"healthy and loyal political competition between different 
political formations," according to French-language daily, 
L'Economiste (August 8). The communique also urges all 
political parties, unions, council and professional chamber 
elected officials, delegates, and all involved personnel to 
respect the law and to abstain from using any influence over 
the voter's choice, including vote buying or the use of 
threats and other constraints which would "falsify the will 
of the voters and offend public order."  It also calls for 
judicial pursuit of those suspected of violating the 
electoral law. 
 
¶3. (U)  The Minister of Justice, Mohammed Bouzoubaa, stated 
on national TV channel 2M on August 4 that Morocco has moved 
on from the period when the administration intervened in the 
electoral process, mentioning that the current problem is 
linked to corruption.  Bouzoubaa explained that the joint 
communique aims at fighting corruption and ensuring the 
transparency of the upcoming elections. 
 
¶4. (U)  The Minister of the Interior, Chakib Benmoussa, said 
during a 2M interview on August 4 that he hopes every party 
will take its share of responsibility in ensuring an 
environment for the success of the upcoming elections. 
Benmoussa also emphasized that his department has given firm 
instructions to walis and governors to use all judicial and 
material means at their disposal to handle any immoral 
practices and to implement the judicial mechanisms necessary 
in order to guarantee the credibility of the upcoming 2007 
elections.
