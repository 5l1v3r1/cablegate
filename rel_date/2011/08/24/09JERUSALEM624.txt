OBAMA'S REMARKS ON TWO-STATE SOLUTION 
 
JERUSALEM 00000624  001.4 OF 002 
 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
President Obama's visit and remarks in Turkey received prominent 
coverage in the Palestinian media, both broadcast and print. 
Palestinian national television and Voice of Palestine radio ran 
continuous news bulletins and all three dailies led with coverage on 
the visit.  Print coverage highlighted Obama's remarks on U.S. 
commitment to the two-state solution.  Front pages also highlighted 
Palestinian Authority reaction, quoting chief PLO negotiator Erekat 
stating that, "we highly appreciate President Obama's emphasis on 
the two-state solution and on the need to achieve a comprehensive 
peace in the Middle East."  Al-Ayyam, which also published a 
front-page picture of Obama addressing the Turkish Parliament, ran 
the sub-headline, "The U.S. is not, and will never be, at war with 
Islam."  All front pages ran separate stories implying Israeli 
displeasure, quoting Israeli Minister of Environment Erdan noting 
that Israel, "does not take orders from Obama."  Palestinian 
commentaries and op-eds were also positive, with Al Quds' main 
editorial calling Obama's remarks a, "direct response to the new 
Israeli Government's stance against the two-state solution," while a 
veteran columnist in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida noted Obama's good 
intentions, though Palestinians are waiting to see real progress "on 
the ground." 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front page reports on Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas' visit to Russia on April 6.  Abbas met 
with Russian President Medvedev to discuss a Middle East Peace 
Conference in Moscow expected later this year, bilateral relations, 
Palestinian national dialogue, and regional changes related to the 
new Israeli government and Obama Administration, according to 
coverage.  Medvedev noted that Russia will continue its support to 
Palestinians and the peace process as well as the two-state 
solution.  Abbas acknowledged Russian support and extended an 
invitation to Medvedev to visit the Palestinian Territories, 
reporting concludes. 
 
In lead photos, Al-Ayyam runs a photo of the decorative stone that 
was "stolen" from the Umayyad Palaces on the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound 
on April 5.  According to coverage that also appears on Al-Quds' and 
Al-Ayyam's front pages, the stone that was taken by Israelis during 
ongoing excavations under the Mosque compound and has been placed in 
front of the Israeli Parliament as if it were Jewish patrimony. 
Al-Ayyam runs a related cartoon on its back page showing a 
tank-bulldozer stealing monument stones with the caption, "the theft 
of our Islamic monuments."  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs a lead photo of 
a house demolition in the Old City of Jerusalem on April 6.  The 
demolished building housed 14 Palestinian family members, according 
to reporting. 
 
Al-Hayat Al Jadida's front page cites a wire report on recent talks 
between Middle East Quartet Envoy Tony Blair and Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on April 6.  Reporting 
highlights Blair's call on Israel to continue negotiations with 
Palestinians regarding a future Palestinian state, in parallel with 
efforts to support the West Bank economy that should include 
granting the Palestinian Authority greater control over West Bank 
areas. Reporting also notes that Blair outlined three items needed 
to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace:  negotiations toward a 
two-state solution, a reform agenda for the West Bank, the lifting 
of the Gaza "siege." 
 
Al-Quds' and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's front pages report on Palestinian 
unity talks, quoting senior Fatah leader Ahmad Quray underscoring 
 
JERUSALEM 00000624  002.3 OF 002 
 
 
that Palestinian unity is a priority Fatah goal and will be achieved 
through Palestinian national dialogue.  Quray commented that the 
last round of Cairo talks failed because Hamas was not ready to make 
decisions on key issues and that he hopes that the final round of 
talks will be productive. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's front page and Ma'an News Agency report on an 
April 6 incident near Nablus where armed Israeli settler guards 
prevented a U.S. Consulate delegation, on a visit to the Palestinian 
village of Qaryut, from viewing areas near the adjacent Israeli 
Hioval settlement.  The reports quote Consulate spokesperson 
Schweitzer-Bluhm confirming the incident and noting that the visit 
to the village was part of regular Consulate visits to the West 
Bank. 
 
In economic news, Al-Quds' inside page reports on an April 6 meeting 
in Nablus held by West Bank gas company representatives.  According 
to coverage, representatives expressed their frustration with the 
deteriorating financial situation in the West Bank and agreed to 
form a union to address issues through official Palestinian 
Authority bodies.  The representatives urged Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas and Premier Fayyad to support the gas sector by not 
issuing additional licenses to new West Bank gas companies since the 
existing number already exceeds market demand.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, 
"Obama's statements and actions"(04/07):  "What interests us most 
about Obama's current [foreign]tour... is his commitment to the 
two-state solution, Palestine and Israel living in peace with 
recognized borders based on the Road Map and Annapolis agreements. 
This policy comes as a clear response to the new Netayahu 
Government's rejection of the two-state solution... a response that 
came right on time... however, the conflict is now deeper... We need 
President Obama to take serious action and not just make statements 
or promises.  The whole region is waiting to see the statements 
translated into actions on the ground... if the President is serious 
about strengthening U.S. relations with the Islamic and Arab worlds, 
he knows, of course, that he can accomplish his goal by ending the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict and establishing the Palestinian 
state... these actions are key to building ties of partnership with 
the Islamic and Arab world." 
 
2) Regular columnist Omar Al-Ghul opines in official daily Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida under the title, "Has Obama's message gotten through?" 
04/07):  "In addressing the Turkish Parliament, Obama stressed the 
support of his Administration for the two-state solution... Obama's 
statements are clear and must be absorbed by the Israeli leaders. 
Arab and Palestinian leaders should also refer to these statements 
when seeking to strengthen their policies and should back every 
effort to oblige Israel to accept the Arab peace initiative that 
includes the establishment of two independent states."
