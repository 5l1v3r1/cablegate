¶1. (U) SUMMARY.  In a national address broadcast live on 
December 24, Prime Minister Meles acknowledged that Ethiopia 
had launched military operations within Somalia, describing 
them as "defensive measures" taken against "terrorist forces" 
who had infiltrated insurgents into Ethiopia.  Citing the 
TFG's decision to exercise jurisdiction over its airspace and 
territorial waters Meles said Ethiopia's intervention would 
be limited in duration, and underscored that Ethiopia had no 
intention of establishing a government in Somalia.  He 
affirmed support for international efforts to promote 
dialogue between the TFG and the UIC, and stated that 
Ethiopia had "no enmity" against the Somali people.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
"DEFENSIVE MEASURES" WILL BE "LIMITED AND PROPORTIONAL" 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶2. (U) On the evening of December 24, Prime Minister Meles 
Zenawi, in a live broadcast via state-run media, announced 
that the Ethiopian military was taking "defensive measures" 
within Somalia, against "terrorists" associated with the 
Union of Islamic Courts (UIC).  He explained that the move 
was in response to "large-scale offensives" by the UIC on 
December 20, aimed at controlling Somalia's Transitional 
Federal Government (TFG), Puntland, and Somaliland, as well 
as destabilizing Ethiopia and other countries in the Horn of 
Africa.  Meles asserted that the UIC had infiltrated large 
numbers of insurgents into Ethiopia, and had launched attacks 
while peace envoys were traveling between Baidoa and 
Mogadishu. 
 
¶3. (U) In his public address, Meles underscored the limited 
duration and scope of Ethiopian military intervention, 
stating that the Ethiopian National Defense Forces (ENDF) 
would immediately withdraw upon accomplishment of their 
mission, which was limited to defending Ethiopia.  "Defensive 
measures" would be "limited and proportional to the attacks 
launched against us and the dangers facing our country, as 
well as in line with international laws," he said.  Citing 
previous efforts at fostering dialogue between the TFG and 
the UIC, Meles affirmed support for efforts by the UNSC, 
African Union, and the European Union to enable the TFG and 
UIC to form a coalition government.  He stated that Ethiopia 
had "no enmity" with the people of Somalia, nor with the 
majority of members and supporters of the UIC.  State-run 
media highlighted the PM's statement that Ethiopia had no 
intention of establishing a government in Somalia, but only 
intended to counter the threat to Ethiopia's national 
security posed by "jihadist and terrorist groups." 
 
¶4. (U) In a separate statement issued on December 24 by the 
MFA and attributed to the defense ministry, the GOE announced 
that the ENDF were taking "defensive measures against 
terrorist forces" in Somalia, who had "attempted to 
infiltrate into Ethiopia to launch attacks."  The statement 
acknowledged ENDF attacks "in various parts of Somalia," 
including Buurhakaba (between Baidoa and Mogadishu), 
Beledweyne, Dinsoor (southwest of Baidoa), and Bandiiradley. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
ETHIOPIA CITES TFG'S JURISDICTION OVER AIRSPACE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5. (U) While not explicitly confirming press reports of 
military operations against airports in Mogadishu, the 
Ethiopian MFA issued a statement on December 26 highlighting 
a December 22 decision by the TFG Council of Ministers (as 
well as a presidential proclamation by TFG President Yusuf) 
to ban unauthorized use of Somali airspace and terroritorial 
waters, and that grants "any sympathetic and friendly nation 
or country" permission to assist the TFG in intercepting or 
stopping "any aircraft, ship or vessel suspected to be 
carrying or possessing arms or other ammunitions or any other 
goods or equipment unlawfully bound into the Somali republic 
for terrorists or any other organization."

¶6. (U) Ethiopian state-run media also highlighted a December 
24 press conference by TFG PermRep to the AU Ambassador 
Abdikarin Farah, in which Farah reportedly stated that 
measures taken by Ethiopia against the UIC were justified, as 
the UIC was receiving support from terrorists from 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Sudan. 
 
¶7. (U) The GOE's public announcements came one month after 
Prime Minister Meles publicly addressed parliament to outline 
the national security threat posed by the UIC and by its 
support for Ethiopian insurgents (ref D), resulting in 
three-fourths of parliamentarians approving "any measures 
necessary" against the UIC 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT:  The GOE's statements are its first public 
acknowledgement of combat operations within Somalia.  Meles' 
public assertion that Ethiopia's intervention would be 
limited in duration and scope, is consistent with earlier 
statements that Ethiopia's military strategy would be to 
"downsize" UIC forces to provide "breathing space" for TFG 
negotiators (ref B).  END COMMENT.
