Summary: 
-------- 
The independent, left-wing Ha'aretz editorialized: "Israel also 
needs to ask itself what was done in its name in Gaza. Israel does 
not need this probe solely because of image considerations. Its 
moral profile in its own eyes is invaluably important.... Such an 
independent investigation launched by Israel will to some extent 
dull the damage of the initial conclusions and the verdict that has 
already been levied against Israel across wide swaths of 
international public opinion." 
 
Ari Shavit, senior op-ed writer for the independent, left-leaning 
Ha'aretz wrote: "-- history will show that Olmert left behind one 
noteworthy achievement. He taught the neighborhood bullies that 
Israel is no wimp. He led the world to recognize that when Israel 
withdraws to its border, it has the right to protect it with all its 
might. The war in Gaza was not an Israeli-Palestinian war. It was a 
war between the alliance of Middle East moderates and the axis of 
extremists. During the war, the United States, Europe, Israel, 
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority functioned as true 
allies. Therefore the war will have strategic repercussions that 
extend beyond the Gaza Strip." 
 
Right wing and former Secretary General of the Judea and Samaria 
Council Israel Harel, opined in the independent, left wing Haa'retz: 
"Deep in their hearts, Israelis - all Israelis - feel no real reason 
for celebration.... The operation opened with a stunning aerial 
blow, which, as in Lebanon, was not accompanied by an immediate 
ground operation....-- most of the goals could have been attained, 
but even when the army did go in, it acted mainly as a pulverizing 
force that cannot, because of its operational and psychological 
weight, chase and destroy elusive Hamas forces." 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Dr. Guy Bechor, a lecturer at the 
Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in the mass-circulation' pluralist 
Yediot Aharonot : "Our deterrence has increased, but the decisions 
in Hamas are not made by Haniya on the inside, they are made by 
Mashal and Iran on the outside, and the latter have an interest in 
continuing the war against Israel.  Hamas will now try to establish 
a new balance of terror against Israel, with the assumption that it 
will not send the IDF in again and reactivate the entire mighty 
system.  If we fire or act against their will, they will fire 
rockets....  From an Iran-friendly stronghold, Gaza will become an 
Iranian stronghold." 
 
Liberal columnist Yael Paz-Melamed wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv: "The US has been and remains our friend and ally, no less 
than in the days of Bush.  The new president holds our democracy in 
high esteem, and will not let it be harmed.  The difference will be 
in the way that he seeks to safeguard our interests...." 
 
Political correspondent Yakov Shaus wrote in Russian-language 
conservative daily Vesty (Thursday, January 22): "Barack Obama is a 
unique personality.  The new American President symbolizes the 
dynamics of American democracy. ... Israeli left-wing is impatiently 
waiting for the peace process to be renewed by Obama, while the 
right-wing is afraid that he, like Democrat Clinton, will take the 
declarations of Arab leaders too close to his heart.  ...  Obama 
started confidently and brilliantly, however it doesn't mean 
anything.  He can be a great president or a bubble." 
 
 
Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
 I: "Investigate now" 
 
The independent, left-wing Ha'aretz editorialized (1/22): "In the 
aftermath of the war, the questions arise. Now, as the last IDF 
soldiers leave the Gaza Strip... The first wave of international 
journalists has already succeeded in entering Gaza through Rafah. 
They [the media] are already reporting on the sites they are 
witnessing for the most important global media outlets. 
International aid organizations have also started investigating what 
transpired on the streets of Gaza.... This is precisely the moment 
at which Israel needs to preempt the others and investigate itself. 
It is impossible to ignore what has already been reported, and one 
must not leave the task of investigating solely to foreign bodies, 
some of whom are hostile. Israel also needs to ask itself what was 
done in its name in Gaza. Israel does not need this probe solely 
because of image considerations. Its moral profile in its own eyes 
is invaluably important.... Such an independent investigation 
launched by Israel will to some extent dull the damage of the 
initial conclusions and the verdict that has already been levied 
against Israel across wide swaths of international public opinion. 
It will also enable Israelis to know what it is we did in Gaza, what 
was permitted and what was unnecessary and even forbidden, from a 
trusted source on whom Israelis can rely. 
We cannot wait until the world has its say, and perhaps takes legal 
steps of its own." 
 
 II: "The Olmert Doctrine" 
 
Ari Shavit, senior op-ed writer for the independent, left-leaning 
Haaretz wrote (1/22): " --But at the last moment, the prime minister 
[Ehud Olmert]found his legacy. Despite everything, Olmert is leaving 
behind a doctrine.According to the Olmert doctrine, when Israel 
withdraws to the international border, it will react powerfully and 
even brutally to provocation....But the war in the Gaza Strip 
accomplished important strategic goals. It punished Hamas, weakened 
and deterred it. It made it clear to any hostile neighbor that 
Israel would not accept attacks on its border and violations of its 
sovereignty. Still, history will show that Olmert left behind one 
noteworthy achievement. He taught the neighborhood bullies that 
Israel is no wimp. He led the world to recognize that when Israel 
withdraws to its border, it has the right to protect it with all its 
might. The war in Gaza was not an Israeli-Palestinian war. It was a 
war between the alliance of Middle East moderates and the axis of 
extremists. During the war, the United States, Europe, Israel, 
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority functioned as true 
allies. Therefore the war will have strategic repercussions that 
extend beyond the Gaza Strip.... The Olmert doctrine is a tough 
defense approach. Many have trouble stomaching it. Indeed, Israel's 
future leadership should make sure the doctrine is implemented 
without mass civilian killing." 
 
 III: "No reason for celebration" 
 
Right wing and former Secretary General of the Judea and Samaria 
Council Israel Harel, opined in the independent, left wing Haa'retz 
(22/): ".... Ostensibly, this week Israelis had a reason for joy and 
hope: the military victory that its leaders declared in high-flying 
language, a victory that is supposed to liberate them from the 
nightmare of rockets. But there is no joy in Israel.... Deep in 
their hearts, Israelis - all Israelis - feel no real reason for 
celebration.... The operation opened with a stunning aerial blow, 
which, as in Lebanon, was not accompanied by an immediate ground 
operation....-- most of the goals could have been attained, but even 
when the army did go in, it acted mainly as a pulverizing force that 
cannot, because of its operational and psychological weight, chase 
and destroy elusive Hamas forces.... The nation feels that once 
again the sword has been sheathed too quickly. It is worried, and 
will make its statement at the ballot box. But what will happen to 
the IDF? Who will shake it up and extricate its senior command, 
before it is too late, from being mired long and deep in the mud of 
mediocrity?" 
 IV: "Back to the Starting Point" 
 
Middle East affairs commentator Dr. Guy Bechor, a lecturer at the 
Interdisciplinary Center, wrote in the mass-circulation' pluralist 
Yediot Aharonot (1/22): "The fire has barely ceased in the Gaza 
Strip, and Hamas has returned to smuggling rockets into the Gaza 
Strip.... The Hamas spokesmen in Gaza, arrogant as ever, have 
already announced that as far as they are concerned, the arms 
smuggling through the tunnels will continue.... Instead of seizing 
the historical opportunity and declaring that after the IDF's 
pullout from Gaza, the crossings between us and the Gaza Strip would 
be closed permanently, which would be accepted by the world due to 
the dramatic timing and the cease-fire, Israel will now agree to 
open the crossings, just as Hamas has always demanded, so that there 
will be someone to continue to feed it.  The Egyptians, of course, 
will continue to close their Rafah crossing, as they did throughout 
the war. It is true that our deterrence has increased, but the 
decisions in Hamas are not made by Haniya on the inside, they are 
made by Mashal and Iran on the outside, and the latter have an 
interest in continuing the war against Israel.  Hamas will now try 
to establish a new balance of terror against Israel, with the 
assumption that it will not send the IDF in again and reactivate the 
entire mighty system.  If we fire or act against their will, they 
will fire rockets.  As far as they are concerned, the next target 
will no longer be Ashkelon or Ashdod; this has already been 
achieved.  Next time they will go for Tel Aviv.... From an 
Iran-friendly stronghold, Gaza will become an Iranian stronghold. 
And let us presume that Hamas has agreed to hold its fire for the 
coming months.  What about Islamic Jihad, which is opposed to the 
initiative?  The PFLP?  The Popular Resistance Committees?  Other 
clans and gangs?  The campaign is over but not done with. 
 
 
 V: "Dread of Change" 
 
Liberal columnist Yael Paz-Mekamed wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv (1/22): "He has fallen upon us at a bad time, this Obama, 
many Israelis say to themselves, based on the scare tactics of right 
wing politicians. If we could only continue the Bush era.  The great 
friend who let us do whatever we wanted.  Without shaking up the 
black dust that has accumulated for nearly 43 years on our relations 
with the Palestinians in the territories....  A chill comes over 
many of us at the thought that Obama might try to shatter the 
narrative that we have been cultivating for decades, that there is 
no one to talk to and that we therefore have to fight....  The US 
has been and remains our friend and ally, no less than in the days 
of Bush.  The new president holds our democracy in high esteem, and 
will not let it be harmed.  The difference will be in the way that 
he seeks to safeguard our interests.... We will not be barred from 
speaking to Assad, even when most intelligence agencies are 
convinced that he is headed for peace.  Conversely, there will be 
pressure, perhaps more than moderate, to resolve the conflict, and 
not only to manage it in the hopeless manner in which it has been 
conducted for years.  If we understand that this is a one-time 
opportunity to change the situation in the Middle East and cooperate 
with the new administration, our own horizon will also become 
immeasurably clearer." 
 
 VI: "A President, Different from all the Others" 
 
Political correspondent Yakov Shaus wrote in Russian-language 
conservative daily Vesty (1/22): "The Inauguration of the 44th 
President of the United States was the most exciting and the most 
expensive one among all the similar ceremonies [that took place in 
the past].  ...  The new American President symbolizes the dynamics 
of American democracy. ... [Obama's] phenomenal political rise can 
be explained by his talent, charisma as well as expectations of the 
society whipped by the crisis and is looking for an alternative to 
the "old-school" leaders.  ... In Israel, the personality of the 
next American president is a very acute issue.  Israeli left-wing is 
impatiently waiting for the peace process to be renewed by Obama, 
while the right-wing is afraid that he, like Democrat Clinton, will 
take the declarations of Arab leaders too close to his heart. 
[Obama] was never liberal towards terror; moreover he worked on this 
issue in the Senate. ... If Bush-junior was playing "friends" with 
'friend Vladimir' [Putin], Obama will be more particular in choosing 
his friends.  He condemned Russia's invasion in Georgia and declared 
that Washington has to change its attitude towards Moscow....  Obama 
started confidently and brilliantly, however it doesn't mean 
anything.  He can be a great president or a bubble."
