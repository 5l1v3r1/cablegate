REF: STATE 123081 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)  Canada remains steadfast in its opposition to the 
plethora of anti-Israel UNGA resolutions outlined in reftel, 
according to Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade Middle East Division Director Michael Grant.  Grant 
noted that Canada has voted this year exactly as it did in 
2007 on the objectionable resolutions that have so far come 
before the UNGA.  Grant commented that he did not anticipate 
any changes from Canada's past voting practices on the 
resolutions that are still pending.  Canada is increasingly 
frustrated with the number and repetitive nature of these 
resolutions, according to Grant.  Grant noted that Canada's 
UN Mission is closely monitoring all these resolutions and 
pledged it will keep in close touch with USUN to work to 
defeat them.
