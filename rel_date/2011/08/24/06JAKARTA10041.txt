RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 128442 
 
¶1. Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Foreign Ministry North 
American Affairs Director Harry Purwanto on August 7.  We 
explained the draft resolution was consistent with the U.S. 
requirement for a sustainable ceasefire and stressed U.S. 
goal was a cessation of hostilities by no later than August 
¶8.  We left a copy of reftel points and the draft resolution 
with Purwanto for reference. 
 
¶2. Purwanto said he would convey the U.S. request to the 
MFA's bureau of multilateral affairs for consideration. 
Purwanto noted that Indonesia had announced its support of 
the UN process in the framework of "five steps" enunciated by 
the Indonesian President Yudhoyono on July 18, 2006.  The 
five steps remained the basis for Indonesia's policy on 
Lebanon in the current crisis.  (Note:  The five are: 
achievement of a ceasefire soon; formation of a peacekeeping 
force under the auspices of the United Nations; provision of 
humanitarian relief; reconstruction and rehabilitation of 
Lebanon; and negotiations toward a just, comprehensive and 
peaceful resolution of the Middle East conflict.) 
 
¶3. Purwanto also stressed Indonesia would be looking closely 
for Lebanon's reaction to the proposal.
