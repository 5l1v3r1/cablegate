¶C.    Equipment Delivered During Reporting Period: None 
 
¶D.    Imminent Training or Equipment Status Update:None 
 
¶E.    Significant Developments in Export Controls, 
Nonproliferation, or Related Border Security 
 
      1) Turkey participated as an observer in the PSI 
exercise conducted in Japan.  The Turkish participation was 
noted in an AP article, which was shared with the Turkish MFA 
in hopes of continuing their active participation in PSI 
exercise. 
 
      2) DOE CIT team visited Turkey from October 24-27 to 
conduct second coordination meeting to allow GOT to begin the 
process of developing a comprehensive training program to 
improve the recognition of Nuclear Dual Use items by Custom 
and other border security individuals.  GOT is very 
interested in developing training protocol for the course 
along with qualified instructor.  GOT will also contact 
Turkish exporters with the hopes of obtaining samples of 
locally produced dual use items that can be used in training. 
 EXBS advisor will assist GOT in the development of 
comprehensive training plan. 
 
      3) The United States verbally received the Turkish 
reply to the U.S. comments on the NP Cooperation Agreement 
(written comments were received in November).  The newest 
draft appears to a layman to meet the necessary requirement 
for approval, but we are awaiting Washington's instructions 
(requested in Ankara 06240). 
 
¶3.    Future Activities 
 
      ¶A. Nov 27- Dec 5 (tent)- DOE Radiological Threat 
Reduction Team to conduct training in conjunction with an 
equipment donation to the Turkish National Police through 
INTERPOL Non-proliferation program. 
 
      ¶B. Dec (tent)-EXBS Advisor will accompany CSI team 
planning to make preliminary assessment on the Port of Izmir. 
      ¶C. Dec/Jan (tent)- DOE SLD Team to conduct follow on 
visit to Ankara to finalize list of priority of border 
locations for installation of equipment and to begin planning 
for site surveys.  This visit is dependent on the status of 
NP Cooperation Agreement. 
 
      ¶D. Jan 17- 20, 2005 (tent)- DOC team scheduled to visit 
Ankara to introduce the Product Identification Tool to 
members of the Turkish government.  This tool can improve the 
resources available to Turkish Customs official at the border 
processing locations. 
 
      ¶E. Mar 2005 (tent)- EXBS Advisor to conduct program 
consultations in Washington DC. 
 
¶4.    Red Flag Issues 
 
      ¶A. Finally the lack of the U.S.-Turkey NP Cooperation 
Agreement has limited the impact of the EXBS program here. 
Expedited evaluation of the GOT's latest comments by the 
Department would be greatly appreciated in order to finally 
complete this agreement, which has been in negotiations for 
over two years. 
 
      ¶B. The GOT is very interested in beginning the SLD, ICP 
and CIT Programs.  While the start of the ICP and CIT 
programs do not require approval of the NP Cooperation 
Agreement, this agreement is one of the first items of 
discussion at every meeting between the EXBS advisor and GOT 
personnel.  Finalizing this agreement will allow a broader 
array of program activities, permitting full engagement with 
the GOT.
