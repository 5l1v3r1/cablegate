¶1.  (SBU) Per reftel, post conducted a site visit to 
establish the bona fides of Mega Indah Cargo Pte Ltd. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Mega Indah Cargo is a limited exempt private 
company that has been operating in Singapore since 1978. 
(Note:  The company was established under a different name, 
Soon Hong Hang Pte Ltd.  End note.)  Singapore's online 
business directory, Biznet, lists the company's principal 
officers as: 
 
Name: Chandra Budhi 
Nationality: Indonesian 
ID: D169693 
Address: 13 Jalan Kusuma Negara, Jogjakarta, Indonesia 
 
Name: Wong Kiah Peng 
Nationality: Singaporean 
ID: S0091677C 
Address: 205 Balestier Road, #09-02, Ruby Plaza, Singapore 
 
Name: Megawaty 
Nationality: Singapore Permanent Resident 
ID: S2579456G 
Address: 22 Newton Road, #30-11, Amaryllis Ville, Singapore 
 
¶3.  (SBU) DHS/ICE databases revealed no negative information 
about Mega Indah Cargo. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) We visited Mega Indah's warehouse on October 24. 
However, no one on the premises could answer our questions 
regarding reftel transaction, and we were asked to contact 
manager Raymond Quek via telephone.  Quek told us that Mega 
Indah does not maintain detailed records in Singapore. 
Bookkeeping is handled at the company's main office in 
Jakarta.  Mega Indah's Singapore operation does not interact 
directly with customers outside of the country, he said. 
Instead, all shipments for Indonesia, for example, are 
forwarded to Mega Indah Jakarta for delivery.  As a result, 
Quek could not provide any information about Mega Indah's 
relationship with the consignee, PT Sarigema Dinamika. 
However, he did say that Mega Indah had a longstanding 
relationship with the American seller, Sun Aviation. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In our assessment, Mega Indah operations in 
Singapore appear legitimate.
