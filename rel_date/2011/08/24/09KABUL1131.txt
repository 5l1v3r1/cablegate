SUBJECT: KARZAI REGISTERS FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
 
¶1. President Karzai officially registered as a candidate for 
the Aug. 20 presidential election this morning (May 4), 
moments before departing for the trilateral meetings in 
Washington.  Karzai registered with Marshall Mohammed Qasim 
Fahim Khan and Karim Khalili as his first and second vice 
presidents, respectively.  An official with the Independent 
Election Commission confirmed that Karzai's registration 
paperwork was complete. 
 
¶2. Karzai is the third official entrant into the presidential 
race, though several dozen other potential candidates have 
expressed interest in running.  Shanwaz Tanai (leader of the 
failed 1990 coup) and Akbar Bai (an ethnic Turkmen and rival 
to Afghan Uzbek warlord Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum) are the 
other two, though neither appears capable of attracting 
significant support.  Sources close to former Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Abdullah and Lower House Deputy Speaker 
Mirwais Yaseni said those candidates would register today or 
tomorrow.  An aide to former Interior Minister Ali Ahmed 
Jalali said Jalali had decided not to register for the 
election and had ended his campaign.  Other major rumored 
challengers have kept quiet regarding their intentions, 
despite just four days remaining before the registration 
deadline.  Two minor potential candidates with American 
citizenship have contacted the Embassy with questions 
concerning renunciation of their citizenship.
