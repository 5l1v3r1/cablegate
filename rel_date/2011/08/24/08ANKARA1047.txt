Court Cancels Authority to Monitor Citizens Nationwide 
All papers report Court of Appeals (Yargitay) has cancelled a High 
Criminal Court decision which gives authority to the gendarme forces 
for nationwide monitoring of suspects.  "No institution can be given 
authority to monitor the entire country, or consider the citizens of 
the democratic and constitutional state of Turkey as suspects," 
according to the Court's decision.  Mainstream Sabah says the ruling 
related to the gendarme will stipulate the annulment of similar 
wiretapping authorizations given to police and the intelligence 
service MIT.  After the Court of Appeals ruling, the courts in 
Ankara will not be able to authorize wiretapping in other provinces; 
authorization for wiretapping must be obtained from local courts. 
 
Paper: "The Obama Wind Blows to the Whole World" 
All media outlets feature Barack Obama's victory in attaining the 
majority of delegates needed to be the Democratic Party's 
presidential nominee.  Coverage focuses on the groundbreaking nature 
of an African-American's rise to the presidential nomination. 
Mainstream Milliyet carries the banner headline, "A First in 
American History," as "Obama becomes the first black presidential 
nominee in U.S. history."  Milliyet columnist Sami Kohen calls this, 
"The First Sign of Change in the U.S."  Liberal Radikal writes, 
"Some Said They Would Never Live to See This Day" and "The Obama 
Wind Blows to the Whole World."  Islamist-oriented Zaman carries the 
headline, "Obama Writes History," as Obama fulfills, "Martin Luther 
King's Dream."  Leftist Taraf writes, "From Now On, America is a 
Different Country."  Mainstream Vatan quotes the candidate in its 
headline, "Our Time is Now."  Mainstream Sabah's headline reads, "An 
American Dream Comes True," as, "A black candidate will run for 
president for the first time in U.S. history, 150 years after the 
abolishment of slavery, and 50 years after racism is banned."  Sabah 
columnist Soli Ozel writes, "Obama is the better preference from the 
perspective of the world," as "He encourages a new approach to the 
way the U.S. sets its international agenda."  Ibrahim Karagul of 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak writes, "Obama has two choices - he can 
reverse the current U.S. foreign policy and begin to compromise, or 
he can surrender to the war-mongering lobbies."  Leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet writes, "The American Media Declare Obama the Winner 
after His Five-Month Marathon to the Nomination." 
 
Editorial Commentary on U.S. Elections 
 
"The African American Candidate" 
Soli Ozel wrote in mainstream Sabah (6/5):  "Barack Hussein Obama 
will be the Democrat Party's 2008 candidate for President.  Hillary 
Clinton pursued a very harsh campaign against Obama and sometimes 
even used indecent manners.  However, all of her tactics will serve 
Obama's interests in the end.  The Clinton campaigners brought up 
every possible negative thing about Obama but he never lost his 
cool.  In fact, the way he dealt with the attacks enhanced his 
leadership qualities.  The fact that a minority has nearly reached 
the White House is a revolutionary thing in U.S. history.  If he 
becomes the new president of the United States, he should not be 
expected to create miracles.   Whatever the president's personal 
agenda, the system is based on checks and balances, which does no
