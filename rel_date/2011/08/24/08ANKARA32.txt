SUBJECT: Update on PKK Violence (December 24-31, 2007) 
 
REF: ANKARA 3031 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of weekly reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) website, which documents contacts and clashes with the PKK, as 
well as casualties incurred. 
 
¶2. (U) During the December 24-31, 2007 reporting period, no GOT 
security official was killed or injured in clashes.  The total 
number of security force casualties for the year through December 
31, 2007 was 139 killed and 216 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same period, eleven PKK terrorists were killed. 
Another four PKKers surrendered and eleven were captured.  The TGS 
claimed in a December 25 statement that between 150-175 terrorists 
were killed in Turkish Air Force strikes against PKK camps and 
operation centers in northern Iraq on December 16 and 22.  According 
to TGS sources, more PKKers may have perished in bombing of 
caves/shelters in northern Iraq during the airstrikes. 
 
¶4. (U) Nevertheless, according to official TGS website figures, 
through the end of the fourth week of December, the number of PKK 
militants killed this year was 295, the number of those captured was 
193, and the number of those who surrendered was 85. 
 
¶5. (U) Civilian casualties for the year through December 31, 2007 
remain at 27 killed, with another 134 wounded.
