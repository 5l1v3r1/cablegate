SUBJECT: LEAHY VETTING REQUEST: REPLACEMENT GENERAL ABDUL RAHMAN 
SARJANG 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. 
 
¶2. (U) In order to comply with Leahy vetting requirements, this 
cable forwards the name and biodata of ANP Brigadier General Abdul 
Rahman Sarjang.  BG Sarjang has been proposed by the Ministry of 
Interior to fill the position of Chief of Police of Gardez Province. 
 This is an appointment that needs to be made as quickly as possible 
due to the strategic importance of Gardez and the weakness of the 
incumbent police chief, Rahofi. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan 
(UNAMA) has vetted Sarjang's background as well as his performance 
in his previous position, as Chief of Police in Ghazni.  It has 
found no derogatory information with regard to human rights abuses. 
Early UNAMA reports had indicated that there were some allegations 
of abuses such as prolonged detention and drug trafficking.  For 
this reason Post did not previously submit Sarjang's name with other 
general officer replacement vetting requests.  Subsequently, 
however, UNAMA reviewed its information and conducted field 
investigations.  Based on interviews with five reliable Afghan 
sources, it determined that the original allegations could not be 
substantiated.  Moreover, Sarjang scored well in several formal MOI 
internal review boards, conducted with international community 
mentor assistance, that assessed both anti-corruption and 
professionalism. 
 
¶4. (U) Biodata as follows: 
 
Name:  Abdul Rahman Sarjang 
Father's Name:  Haji Ajmir Khan 
Grandfather's Name: Janan 
Age: 41 
POB: Mian Khel district
