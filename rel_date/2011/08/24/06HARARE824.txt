SUBJECT: SELF-HELP INTERIM OBLIGATION REPORT - HARARE 
 
REF: STATE 106757 
 
Â¶1.  Following is the interim report on project selection of 
AmEmbassy Harare's FY-05 Self-Help allowance of US 
$100,000.  Post does not anticipate returning any money for 
re-allocation.  Post has focused funding on the following 
areas based on the current harsh economic climate and the 
HIV/Aids pandemic:  women, children and orphans, HIV/Aids, 
water development and income generation. 
 
IAA-5-613-01 - YOUNG COALITION CENTER - $6,000.00 
The organization trains youth for income-generating 
projects and assists orphans by paying school fees and 
buying uniforms.  A qualified brick-molder machinist 
currently trains the youths using two-hand molders that 
results in substandard products.  The center is in a 
position to provide building materials for community 
members impacted by government destruction of purportedly 
unauthorized homes.  The SSH funds were used for an 
electric brick-molding machine in order to increase the 
quantity and quality of production. 
 
IAA-5-613-02 - NEW "ERROR" WOMEN'S SEWING PROJECT - 
$3,000 
In 2003 a group of 10 HIV-affected women formed a sewing 
co-op aiQat training disadvantaged and HIV-positive 
women and girls in making schQ uniformQor local 
schools.  The group sought SSH funds for the purchase of 
new sewing machines and an embroidery machine to produce 
better quality uniforms. 
 
IAA-5-613-03 - KUFUNDA LEARNING VILLAGE - $1,000.00 
The project assists poor rural communities build easy, 
cheap compost toilets as an alternative to concrete 
latrines, which many cannot afford.  The toilet provides 
rich humus fertilizer for crops.  Members of the Kufunda 
Learning Village are working with five communities and have 
already supplied 100 compost toilets to each community. 
Kufunda sought to expand the scope of the project to 
include additional communities.  SSH funds are providing 
funds to purchase material for 65 compost toilet starter 
kits. 
 
IAA-53-613-04 - KAPIRI SECONDARY SCHOOL - $7,000.00 
Housed at the Kapiri secondary school, the project sought 
SSH funds to construct a grinding mill operation.  The 
project is monitored and operated by the school development 
committee comprised of community members, parents and 
teachers.  It will serve as an income generation tool for 
the community.  The school development committee is 
providing 25% of the total cost of the project. 
 
IAA-53-613-05 - MUKARO GARDENING & CONSERVATION - $6,000.00 
With the assistance of the Rural Unity for Development 
Organization (RUDO), the 259-member Mukaro community 
gardening project has worked in 39 villages to provide more 
than 900 orphans with access to community gardens through 
the purchase of materials and training in organic farming 
methods.  Proceeds from the sale of vegetables, which 
totaled  $214 million ZWD in 2004, have further contributed 
to the purchase of clothes, food, and education for these 
orphans.  Under RUDO management, SSH funds are being used 
to provide fencing, start-up materials, and toilets for the 
completion of an eight-hectare herbal plantation.  The sale 
of produce will increase project income, as well as provide 
the community with access to herbs associated with the 
relief HIV/Aids. 
 
IAA-5-613-06 - BONDA ART & CRAFT PROJECT - $8,000.00 
This thirty women co-op, establish in 1993, produces batik 
products using various production techniques.  The women 
developed a process to produce batik products using local 
material such as cotton and sadza.  The SSH funds have 
expanded their sadza-batik production through the purchase 
of new drying racks, a tin roof, and other materials. 
 
IAA-5-613-07 - DZIDZAI FOUNDATION TRUST - $3,000.00 
This is a registered community organization, based at Hauna 
growth point in the Honde valley, which offers training in 
sewing, knitting, and catering skills to women and youths 
that are unable to pursue further academic education. 
Formed in the early 1980's by 13 women, the organization 
built a training center with financial assistance from 
Norwegian people's aid.  The center used SSH funds to 
purchase four new electric sewing machines. 
 
IAA-5-613-08 - DUMBABWE SANGANO WOMEN CENTER - $9,000.00 
The original proposal for this project requested funds to 
install a borehole to increase water access for herb 
gardens and other income generation activities.  However, 
before the SSH funds could be allocated, the center 
acquired funds from elsewhere.  Thus, the SSH agreement was 
never signed and the original proposal has been voided.  In 
order to use these funds, amendments are being submitted on 
other FY-05 projects that fell short of funds to complete 
their proposed work. 
 
IAA-5-613-09 - LUPOTE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE PROJECT - 
$17,000.00 
Through a partnership with the Painted Dog Conservation 
Society, a former USAID partner, the Lupote primary school 
established a vegetable garden in 2004 to generate income 
as an alternative to community members' poaching animals 
for income.  The garden, adjacent to the school grounds, is 
used to train the local community in small garden 
techniques and sustainable agricultural practices.  SSH 
funds are being used to provide a borehole to increase 
income-generating activities, promote environmentally 
sustainable agriculture production, and provide potable 
water to the primary school. 
 
IAA-5-613-10 - MKAUZANENI HORTICULTURAL PROJECT - $11,500 
The Mkauzaneni Horticulture project is a small community 
garden project run by 10 women on the premises of the 
Mkauzeneni primary school. In FY-02, SSH funds provided 
piping and a water tank as part of a project to increase 
production on a 12-hectare plot of land adjacent to the 
school.  However, due to accounting problems with the 
original contractor, FY-05 resources were needed to provide 
a pump and piping for the completion of the project.  With 
the borehole pump and water reservoir, the community will 
be able to diversify and add projects, such as, poultry, 
pig and rabbit production. 
 
IAA-5-613-11 - UKUTHUTHUKA WATER PROJECT - $12,000 
Ukuthuthuka Kwempilo is a community-based group that has 
been in existence for five years.  The community currently 
draws water from a river seven km away.  The group is well 
organized with a water committee of eight members.  In 
FY-02, SSH funds were provided to install a borehole, 
piping, and water tank.  However, problems in locating 
water required digging multiple boreholes that led to 
significant cost overruns.  The community remains without 
water.  FY-05 funds are being used to complete the project 
under the original terms of the agreement between the U.S. 
Embassy and the community. 
 
IAA-5-613-12 - YOUNG GENERATION PRESCHOOL - $5,000 
This pre-school and nursery is operated by three teachers. 
Despite the lack of a hard structure, toilets, or 
furniture, 120 children are cared for daily in the 
Hatcliffe extension community.  SSH funds are being used to 
construct a temporary structure, toilet, and furniture for 
the creche, allowing children in the community to learn in 
a classroom setting for the first time.  Any additional 
resources will be used for the purchase of school supplies. 
 
IAA-5-613-13 - GOKWE JOMBO HORTICULTURAL PROJECT - $11,500 
This project was initially funded in 2002 to assist a 
community of 80 families with a borehole for clean drinking 
water and irrigation for a two-hectare garden plot.  The 
grant was used to pay for a borehole, tank, security 
fencing and garden tools in order to increase income for 
members of the mostly HIV positive group.  The grant amount 
was US $13,000.  The community provided all the labor for 
the project.  The project did not achieve its goals because 
of a decrease in the water table and problems with the 
borehole contractor.  FY-05 SSH is providing for additional 
piping, a diesel pump, and outlet taps to complete the 
work.  The SSH office plans to employ a hydrological 
consultant to determine the full extent of materials needed 
to complete the project.
