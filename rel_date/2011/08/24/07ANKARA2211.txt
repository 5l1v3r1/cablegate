In Today's Papers 
 
Turkey Uneasy over Jewish Group's Recognition of Armenian Genocide 
 
All papers report that during a meeting yesterday Foreign Minister 
Abdullah Gul told Pinhas Avivi, the Israeli ambassador to Ankara, of 
Turkey's disappointment over the Anti-Defamation League's (ADL) 
decision to call the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turkish 
forces during World War I genocide.  Gul urged Israel to use its 
influence over the Jewish lobby groups in the US.  According to 
Hurriyet, Avivi told Gul that Israel was disturbed by the change in 
the attitude of the ADL, stressing there is no change in the Israeli 
government's position with regard to the incidents of 1915.  During 
a phone talk with Israeli President Shimon Peres yesterday, Prime 
Minister Erdogan expressed Turkey's concern over the ADL decision. 
Peres reportedly pledged to do his best in support of Turkey. 
 
Sabah reports that the ADL retreated after Turkey's initiatives and 
released a new statement proposing the establishment of a joint 
commission for the investigation of genocide claims, "to assist the 
parties in achieving a resolution of their profound differences." 
Milliyet believes the statement came as a result of Israel's 
intervention "to adjust the attitudes of the Jewish lobby." 
Cumhuriyet sees the AKP policy in support of Hamas as being the main 
reason for the change seen in the attitude of the Jewish lobby 
groups. 
 
Editorial Commentary on the Armenian Issue 
Ergun Babahan writes in the mainstream daily Sabah: "It is no secret 
that Turkey-Iran economic and military rapprochement has created 
uneasiness both in Israel and the US.  The Iran gas deal was 
realized despite Washington's objection.   Iran remains the number 
one enemy for Israel because of its open support for Hizbullah in 
Lebanon.  Let's remember that President Bush declared three 
countries the 'axis of evil' prior to the Iraq war.  After that, 
Iraq was invaded, compromise was reached with North Korea and now 
only Iran remains.  Thus it comes as no surprise that American 
Jewish organizations have suddenly changed their stance and started 
calling the Armenian deportation genocide. The Jewish community has 
lived in this region in peace with Turkey.  Given the regional 
circumstances, Israel has no friend other than Turkey.   Turkey and 
Israel are involved in military and strategic engagements.  This 
current situation will harm Israel more than Turkey as Israel's good 
relationship with a non-Arab Muslim country will deteriorate." 
 
Ismet Berkan writes in the liberal-intellectual daily Radikal: "With 
the ADL's decision the pending Armenian Genocide Resolution in the 
Congress has gained more ground.  We have to realize that almost 
every negative about Turkey stems from Turkey's lack of strategic 
thinking and long term planning.  Turkey should have been capable of 
handling this issue when it first emerged in early 1970s.  If Turkey 
had been able to stand up and apologize for the 1915 events and 
tragedy during the Ottoman Empire time, the international community 
would not be so negative about us.  By doing that Turkey would have 
been able to debate the issue in a non-emotional, healthy fashion. 
On the contrary, Turkey displayed a defensive attitude rather than 
strategic thinking.  We were captivated by fears, and now we see 
that our fears are haunting us. Even if we assume that the entire 
world is wrong and hostile, can we still say that Turkey did no 
wrong in this situation?" 
 
Iraqi VP Meets Erdogan, Gul during Turkey Visit 
All papers report the Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi came 
Thursday to Ankara to seek support for resolving disagreements 
between the Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish group in the Iraqi government. 
 Hashimi told reporters on his arrival the Iraqi government was 
clear in its intention to put into practice the Turkey-Iraq 
memorandum of understanding signed during a recent visit to Turkey 
by Prime Minister al-Maliki.  Hashimi later met with Prime Minister 
Erdogan and asked for the PM's help in returning Sunnis to the 
 
ANKARA 00002211  002 OF 002 
 
 
government.  Erdogan reportedly declined to put forth concrete 
proposals, but said he was ready to help Iraqi groups work out 
sectarian differences.  PKK terror was not raised during talks with 
the Iraqi VP since Hashimi is known to be a figure who shares 
Turkey's views. Hashimi leaves Turkey today after a morning meeting 
with Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul. 
 
MFA Note to US on Cyprus Oil 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that Turkey gave the US a diplomatic 
note to express Turkey's disturbance regarding the US-based Noble 
Energy's bid on Greek Cypriot Oil exploration.  The US 
Administration responded to Ankara's initiative by saying that it 
was a business issue and that US companies do not need the 
administration's permission to make international bids. Reportedly, 
Turkey plans to get in touch directly with Nobel Energy to explain 
the Cyprus issue in detail and the drawbacks of engaging in such 
exploration. 
 
Reports on Iranian Army Crossing the Border with Iraq 
Vatan, Yeni Safak, Cumhuriyet and others:  Iraqi Kurdish party KDP's 
Peyamner website site claimed that Iranian troops penetrated five 
kilometers into Iraqi territory, causing massive material damage.
