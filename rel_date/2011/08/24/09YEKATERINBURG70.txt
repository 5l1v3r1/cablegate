¶1. (SBU)  On October 28, Vice Consul and Pol/Econ assistant 
attended a procedural hearing at Sverdlovsk regional court for 
imprisoned human rights activist Aleksey Sokolov.  A former 
prisoner turned activist, Sokolov was arrested on May 13 in the 
run-up to the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, 
which took place in June.  The ostensible reason for Sokolov's 
arrest was new information, all coming from prison informants, 
implicating Sokolov is a series of old crimes.  (see reftels) 
The October 28 hearing could have either resulted in formal 
charges, an extension of the investigation period, or Sokolov's 
release.  The judge canceled the hearing at the last minute and 
rescheduled it for November 18th.  In the meantime, Sokolov's 
lawyer told us on October 30 that the prosecutor had found the 
case against Sokolov sufficient to warrant a criminal trial. 
The lawyer expects that the trial will take place in the next 
few weeks. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Sokolov's previous hearings had been closed to the 
public and we were surprised to find that no media of any kind 
appeared at the court to cover this first public hearing.  We 
were joined at the courthouse by a Consul from the German 
Consulate, Sokolov's wife, his attorney, and another prisoner 
rights activist who spent time in Soviet gulag system.  The 
presence of international observers was unusual enough to 
illicit a snide response from court bailiff who spoke 
dismissively to Sokolov's attorney about our presence. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU)  According to the judge, the hearing was canceled due 
to the late notification regarding Sokolov's desire to 
participate in the hearing via video conference.  Sokolov's 
attorney ridiculed the justification and said that he had filed 
the request on time.  He said that Sokolov has participated in 
all of his court hearings and alleged that authorities were 
making it impossible for Sokolov to file the necessary documents 
from prison. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Sokolov's wife was very appreciative of the 
Consulate's presence.  She said she felt that international 
attention on her husband's case was helping to insure his safety 
in prison.  She asked that the Consulate again send a 
representative to the next hearing.
