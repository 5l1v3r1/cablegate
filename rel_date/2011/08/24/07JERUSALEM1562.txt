Haniyeh all enjoying significant support as well. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  From July 8-15, NDI conducted a poll in Gaza and the West 
Bank to identify popular views on key political issues 
following Hamas' takeover of Gaza. NDI is implementing a 
Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) program focused on 
political party reform and this poll will inform programming 
and future focus groups. Through Alpha, a local polling firm, 
1000 Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank were contacted by 
phone. The sample size disproportionately represented Gazans.

tabulation by gender and age was emailed to NEA/IPA and

"somewhat favorable" view of Abu Mazen; 94 percent for Marwan

Khaled Meshal;

76 percent support early Presidential elections. A 
significant portion of those polled (36 percent) would vote

Hamas begin unconditional negotiations with each other. 54 
percent do not think the emergency government will be able to 
resolve the situation in Gaza.

commtted to fighting corruption. 48 percent think thatFatah 
will improve their quality of life, 24 perent believe that 
Hamas will, and 17 percent thin that no one will. 
 
¶4. Comment: This was a telepone poll, and there are no local 
studies on the ipact of that bias on the data. In addition, 
in NI,s words, "there are no neutral pollsters in 
Paestine."  Multiple questioners were involved in asing the 
poll's questions and there is no way of nowing what sort of 
inflection was used in asking questions, etc. There are 
significant conflicts n the polling data (approval of 
leaders for examle). As with all polling data in the West 
Bank ad Gaza, we recommend that the results be viewed wih 
caution.
