Media Highlights 
 
FBI Director Mueller Visit Dominates News:  Biometrics Top Issue 
All papers extensively cover FBI Director's visit to Ankara 
yesterday, with many using key messages from a US Embassy press 
release in reports.   Mainstream Sabah headline reads "FBI Director: 
Six Hours, Three Important Meetings" and reports that Mueller met 
with Deputy PM Cicek, Justice Minister Ergin and Security Department 
Director Koksal to discuss the PKK elements in Northern Iraq, the 
situation in Makhmur refugee camp and next steps in the process 
after the Treasury Department's sanctions against the three "drug 
kingpin" PKK leaders.  Sabah notes that Deputy PM Cicek said that 
"Mueller reiterated support for cooperation between Turkey and the 
US in the fight against terror, but we did not discuss Makhmur and 
nuclear issues."  Mainstream Aksam headline reads "Either Try Them 
or Return to Us" and claims Cicek asked Mueller for closer 
cooperation in the extradition of PKK terrorists to Turkey.  In an 
interview with Aksam, Cicek said he emphasized that all three of the 
accused PKK drug smugglers were hiding in Northern Iraq, in an area 
under the control of the US.  Cicek added that they also discussed 
Turkey's preparation of new terror regulations, the establishment of 
a public order under secretariat and the draft law concerning the 
protection of personal information that is now in parliament.  Aksam 
also notes that the US Embassy remained silent before the visit, but 
yesterday released a statement announcing that the visit focused on 
the fight against terror.  Liberal Radikal headline on the front 
page reads "A Shocking Demand from the US" and, based on information 
provided by "high level sources," reports that Mueller asked Turkey 
to collect the biometrical data of all people using Turkish airports 
and harbors and to share this information with the US to better 
monitor terrorists travelling through Turkey.  Radikal reports that 
the demand was rejected outright by the Turkish side because both 
Turkish and EU harmonization laws do not permit compiling of this 
kind of information.  Most papers referred to the US Embassy press 
release in saying that the FBI Director came to Turkey to discuss 
ongoing and important cooperation on counter terrorism and 
law-enforcement matters.  Meanwhile, leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet 
rebuffed these US assertions for the visit, noting that the "main 
issue" was the security of US troops withdrawing from Iraq. 
 
Energy Minister On Cancelled Nuclear Tender; Notes Parris Visit 
HaberTurk TV and online website report extensively on remarks by 
Energy Minister Yildiz at a press conference before an Energy Summit 
in Ankara. Most of the article is about how Yildiz is expecting the 
final TETAS decision regarding the cancellation of the nuclear power 
plant tender before next week's Bayram holiday.  HaberTurk also 
notes that Energy Minister Yildiz confirmed that President Obama's 
"Special Energy Envoy"  Mark Parris arrived yesterday and that they 
discussed regional issues.  Regarding a question on Iran uranium, 
Minister Yildiz said "We did not say the uranium must be kept in 
Turkey.  If Iran and the UN put a demand in this regard we are going 
to evaluate it.  Our approach on this issue is positive because 
Turkey has technical capacity." 
 
 
Iran Rejects Nuclear Deal.  Continued coverage in today's newspapers 
on Iran's rejection of the IAEA nuclear proposal to store LEU in 
Turkey.  Mainstream Sabah headline reads "Iran Doesn't Make Any 
Effort," saying "Iran blocked the way to the UN's nuclear proposal." 
 In "A Clear NO from Iran," leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet 
emphasizes the "UN has offered the proposal to overcome the crisis 
over Iran's nuclear program and Turkey was one of the potential 
candidates for storing Iranian uranium."  Islamist-oriented Zaman 
carries the headline, "Iran Rejects Demand for Storing Uranium 
Abroad," and opines "Iran's decision will raise tensions between the 
sides."  In "I Won't Send Uranium," liberal Radikal highlights 
international reaction saying "France is disappointed with Iran's 
decision while US indicated that Iran has little time left for a 
positive reply." 
 
US Model for Presidential Election 
 
ANKARA 00001665  002 OF 003 
 
 
Intellectual/Islamist oriented Zaman and mainstream Hurriyet report 
that the Council of Ministers adopted a bill that sets up the 
infrastructure for presidential elections by popular vote for the 
first time in 2012.  Based on the US election model, candidates must 
have transparent election bank  accounts and all income and 
expenditures during campaigns must be registered in these accounts. 
No financial assistance will be given from the Treasury.  Zaman 
notes that the 26-article bill is expected to go to parliament 
soon. 
 
Pundits' Focus: Iraq; Turkish Foreign Policy Direction and 
Turkey-Armenia Normalization 
 
Prominent Turkish pundits today address a variety of issues mostly 
through philosophical arguments.  In mainstream Hurriyet, Cuneyt 
Ulsever comments on the growing Turkey, Iraq and the US cooperation, 
which he believes makes for  "the essence of Kurdish initiative." 
He calls on  the government  to explain to the public what exactly 
Turkey has promised to contribute in Northern Iraq/PKK and in the US 
troop withdrawal process.  Semih Idiz of mainstream Milliyet is 
interested in the aftermath of Iraq war which he believes "despite 
strongly negative expectations, Turkey has started enjoying economic 
benefits by increasing trade and cooperation with Iraq." 
 
Milliyet's Kadri Gursel has an objection regarding the Turkey-EU 
process.  He argues that Turkey's engagement in the Alliance of 
Civilization "is working against Turkey's integration with the EU." 
His advice is that Turkey stops acting as speaker for the Islamic 
world, and "focus merely on full democracy and rule of law" 
instead. 
 
Regarding Turkey-Armenia normalization, panelist Hasan Cemal notes 
that signing protocol is only a beginning and should be fulfilled by 
a campaign "to win hearts and minds."  Attending a Harvard 
University panel discussion, Cemal is suggesting that "a liberal 
debate on genocide and facing up to history" is needed urgently. 
 
GMO Debate: "US Firm Bribed the Agriculture Ministry" (HaberTurk) 
Mainstream HaberTurk reports that the US authorities identified a 
bribery case by an American firm while doing business with Turkey in 
order to promote GMO-engineered cotton seeds.  The report claims: 
"American Capital Board (SEC) examined the documents related to 
Delta & Pine Land (DPL) company's efforts during the 2001-2007 
period in Turkey.  SEC concluded that DPL gave bribes to Turkish 
agriculture ministry officials while selling genetically modified 
cotton seeds."  The bribery case was also admitted by Monsanto, 
which took over DPL in 2007 and committed the company to pay 300,000 
USD fine to the SEC, the story adds.  HaberTurk also tells its 
readers that the amount of the bribe has not been clearly 
identified, however there was credible evidence regarding DPL's 
gratuities to Turkish authorities such as paid travel, 
refrigerators, computers and office furniture.  Talking with the 
then Director General at the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture, 
HaberTurk quoted the former manager as saying "Let's not forget that 
we live in Turkey.  All companies distribute presents to 
authorities."
