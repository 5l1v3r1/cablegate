¶1. (U) This cable is a correction for deleted BRUSSELS 846. 
Population figures for Muslims in para 2 have been revised 
upwards. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary:  At a June 10 luncheon for Muslim community 
leaders, activists, and academics, Charge elicited the 
reaction to President Obama's June 4 speech.  Belgium has one 
of the highest concentrations of Muslims in Western Europe, 
with estimates of the Muslim population ranging from 400,000 
to 500,000.  The speech was well received and widely viewed 
and read.  Three of the seven topics addressed in the speech 
sparked in depth discussion: the Middle East Conflict, 
women's issues, and economic development.  The guests urged 
the U.S. to balance its support for Israelis and Palestinians 
and to take pains to avoid vetoes on Middle East resolutions 
in the UN.  On women's issues, the guests suggested that 
education and women's empowerment were more important than 
dwelling on the headscarf.  Economic development was seen as 
an important goal.  End Summary. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Charge hosted on June 10 a luncheon for ten 
influential Muslim contacts to gauge their reactions to 
President Obama's June 4 speech to the Muslim world. Pol-Econ 
Counselor, a Poloff, Polintern, and PAO and Cultural Affairs 
Assistant attended.  The lively discussion revealed that 
President Obama's speech was well-received and a topic of 
extensive conversation in the Belgian Muslim community.  The 
guests included: members of NGOs, the leader of a Brussels 
organization for minority youth, radio and print journalists, 
business and banking professionals, a university professor, 
an analyst from the Belgian Threat Analysis Center, a 
prominent lawyer, an Antwerp City Councilman, a female 
Senator, and the chairwoman of the Belgian Association of 
Muslim Professionals.  The guests came from all three regions 
of Belgium (Flanders, Wallonia, Brussels) and represented 
both linguistic communities.  They had all watched, read, and 
analyzed the speech and freely offered their opinions. 
 
GENERAL REACTIONS 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Overall, the speech was very well received by the 
guests, who said it was widely-viewed and read throughout the 
Belgian Muslim community.  One guest even remarked that 
President Obama's speech was the first political issue ever 
discussed at his extended family's weekly meal.  Several 
guests commented that they were waiting to see what concrete 
steps the U.S. would take next to address the points the 
President raised.  One offered a speech writer's critique, 
praising it as a classically crafted speech, dazzling in its 
delivery and historic in its timing, which touched people 
directly.  Another cited POTUS' example and the American 
experience of Muslim integration as one for European leaders 
and countries to follow in terms of breaking down barriers 
between Muslims and non-Muslims in Europe.  Those present 
expressed a strong desire to be accepted as citizens, and not 
viewed as immigrants or outsiders. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  The guests also expressed some general concerns 
with the President's message.  One noted the speech was being 
delivered in what he termed a dictatorship, Egypt; many 
Muslims he said, believe the U.S. was often overly 
sympathetic to undemocratic Muslim countries.  Another urged 
the U.S. to take into account the diversity of the Muslim 
world if it wants to open a new era of relations.  Another 
commented that the idea of a partnership between Islam and 
the U.S.; i.e., "a partnership between a state and a religion 
-- seemed irrational."  Many think the U.S. always sees a 
religious angle to everything in the Middle East. 
 
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  President Obama's comments on the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict engendered the most discussion. 
The guests made clear that U.S. vetoes in the UN in favor of 
Israel sent the wrong message to the Muslim world.  Charge 
cautioned the U.S. would continue to oppose one-sided 
 
BRUSSELS 00000853  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
resolutions that tend to blame Israel exclusively for 
problems in the Middle East.  Several guests replied that 
regardless of the wording or justification, the U.S. is 
perceived as one-sided and overly protective of Israel, 
unwilling to hold Israel accountable, and oblivious to 
Palestinian suffering.  They urged the U.S. to work 
diplomatically to ensure balanced resolutions and avoid use 
of its veto, which reverberates negatively throughout the 
Muslim world.  They also noted that it appeared that 
Palestinian lives were not "worth as much" to Americans as 
Israeli or Western lives.  The strongest statement was that 
civil disobedience may change domestic policies, but rarely 
works to end an occupation; fighting has been necessary for 
people to achieve independence from "foreign occupation." 
 
WOMEN'S ISSUES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU)  The President's reference to the use of headscarves 
sparked a lively discussion.  A few expressed surprise that 
the scarf was chosen as an example.  They believed it was not 
a good choice as an illustration of U.S. commitment to 
women's rights.  Our guests said that the headscarf is an 
issue primarily outside majority Muslim countries and that it 
would have been preferable to recognize the ways women are 
oppressed in some Muslim countries, such as the inability to 
drive a car in Saudi Arabia.  One remarked that men focus 
more on the headscarf than on the women themselves, and 
access to education was a more important issue for women's 
development, emancipation, and equality.  Finally, they 
concluded the headscarf issue had taken on symbolic 
significance rather than a substantive one.  They also 
pointed to the economic underpinnings of any successful 
strategy in the Muslim world for, as one of them pointed out, 
the reasons Muslims are here in Belgium (and in Europe in 
general), are the economic and democratic failures in their 
countries of origin.  They believed that economic development 
and free trade agreements are crucial for the region, though 
one guest cautioned trade agreements often exact a hefty 
price in the short run on weaker Mediterranean economies. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8. (SBU)  The willingness of our guests to join in a 
free-form and lively discussion showed that President Obama's 
Cairo speech had reached the Muslim community in Belgium. 
They unanimously agreed that the speech was a topic of 
conversation throughout all socio-economic levels of their 
communities.  The focus on the Israeli-Palestinian issue 
during the lunch showed that the conflict was the major 
hurdle, which the guests hoped the U.S. would address in a 
new way, though they knew there would be many challenges. 
The guests were happy the President had made this effort, but 
hoped that real action on the Middle East would follow from 
the President's words.
