LIMITED FUEL/HUMANITARIAN AID 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Two mortars were fired from Gaza late June 28, but 
no impacts were reported on the Israeli side of the perimeter 
fence, and no injuries/damage were reported.  Palestinian 
press report the Israeli Navy fired on fishing boats off the 
coast near Dayr al-Balah (central Gaza) on June 28, without 
causing any injuries or damage. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) UN, Palestinian and NGO contacts report that Sufa 
crossing was open June 29-30, allowing roughly 80 truckloads 
of commercial and humanitarian products on both days.  The 
Karni/al-Mintar commercial crossing was closed June 29-30, 
although the conveyer belt near that crossing continued 
transfers of grains and animal feed into Gaza.  Erez 
pedestrian crossing was open on July 29-30 to several 
international NGO employees and 25 medical patients that had 
pre-arranged departure with the GOI.  The director of the 
Gaza Fuel Agency said Nahal Oz fuel transfer station was open 
June 29-30 for limited shipments of industrial fuel, diesel, 
gasoline, and cooking gas.  The Fuel Agency said that GOI 
plans to allow 2.2 million liters of industrial fuel, 880,000 
liters of diesel, 75,000 liters of gasoline, and 800 tons of 
cooking gas into Gaza from June 29-July 4, an amount set by 
the IDF, not by terminal capacity or demand (both of which 
are much higher).  Rafah crossing was closed June 28-29. 
Palestinian press report that the crossing will be open on 
July 1-2 for students, medical cases and Palestinians who 
reside abroad. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hamas leader Mahmud al-Zahar told press June 28 
that Hamas will disarm and arrest anyone who violates the 
ceasefire.  Hamas-controlled police detained al-Aqsa Martyrs 
Brigades spokesman Muhammad Irmanah (Abu Qusay) in Rafah on 
June 29, releasing him late the same day, after Abu Qusay 
issued a statement that claimed the al-Aqsa Brigades will 
continue to fire rockets and that Hamas and other factions 
have betrayed the Palestinian resistance by accepting a 
Gaza-only ceasefire.  (Note: Al-Aqsa militants in the West 
Bank threatened June 29 to attack Hamas members in the West 
Bank if Abu Qusay was not immediately released.  End note). 
Separately, Fatah released names of 49 faction members jailed 
by Hamas, and alleged that family members of the arrestees 
have been prevented from visiting.  Fatah contacts said Hamas 
security men arrested five additional Fatah activists in Bayt 
Lahiya on June 28. 
 
¶4.  (U) PIJ leader Khalid al-Batsh told press June 29 that 
the Gaza ceasefire will eventually collapse if Gaza's 
crossings remain closed or restricted.  He said PIJ and Hamas 
have a common position on the ceasefire and Hamas is 
preparing for future confrontations with Israel.
