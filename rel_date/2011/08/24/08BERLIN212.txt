SUBJECT: GERMANY: KOSOVO RECOGNITION LETTER ON ITS WAY 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) The German cabinet approved today (February 20) FM 
Steinmeier's proposal to recognize Kosovo's independence. 
MFA Western Balkans Deputy Director Marc Bogdahn told us that 
President Koehler, who has been on vacation in the German 
state of Thuringia, was expected to return to Berlin this 
afternoon to sign the letter of recognition, which will then 
be transmitted to Kosovar President Sejdiu. 
 
¶2. (U) In a speech before the Bundestag after the cabinet 
decision, FM Steinmeier noted that Germany would have 
preferred a consensus solution on Kosovo status, but that 
nine years of fruitless efforts showed this was not possible. 
 He emphasized that the case of Kosovo was unique and should 
not be viewed as a precedent for secessionist movements 
elsewhere in Europe.  He also indicated that recognition was 
not the end of the road, but rather the start of a long 
process to help Kosovo, through the EU rule-of-law mission 
and NATO-led KFOR, to become fully self-sufficient as an 
independent country.  Kosovo, in return, was expected to live 
up to its promises to protect minorities, respect human 
rights and to accept international supervision. 
 
¶3. (U) While not enthusiastic about Kosovo's unilateral 
declaration of independence, most parliamentarians -- 
including those in the opposition -- acknowledged that there 
had really been no other alternative and that Germany was 
right to grant immediate recognition.  Several talked about 
the need to offer Serbia and Kosovo a future in the EU, where 
national borders have lost much of their former significance. 
 Only Left Party parliamentarians opposed Kosovo's 
declaration of independence and the German recognition of it, 
calling them a violation of international law and contrary to 
UNSCR 1244.  These parliamentarians also raised concerns that 
Germany's recognition of Kosovar independence would encourage 
the Kurdish, Basque and Ossetian secessionist movements.
