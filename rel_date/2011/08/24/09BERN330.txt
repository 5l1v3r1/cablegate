SUBJECT: SWISS RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE SEEKING DONOR SUPPORT 
FOR THE SOMALIA TFG FOLLOWING AGREEMENT WITH PWC 
 
REF: SECSTATE 79853 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche on August 7 to Anja 
Zobrist-Rentenaar, Regional Coordinator for Southern Africa 
at the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), 
and Jenny Piaget, Deputy Regional Coordinator.  Piaget 
responded that Swiss government funding for Somalia is solely 
tied to humanitarian support.  She said that Switzerland has 
not pledged money for security, and does not plan to do so. 
Piaget added that the GoS would like to support humanitarian 
programs in Somalia more actively and directly, but that the 
situation on the ground precludes the Swiss from doing so. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Zobrist-Rentenaar and Piaget underlined that 
Switzerland has substantially increased its humanitarian aid 
to Somalia, going from CHF 2 million (approx. USD 1.9 
million) two years ago to a current level of CHF 8 million 
(approx. USD 7.5 million) in annual funding.  Piaget added 
that the GoS has allocated CHF 200,000 (approx. USD 187,000) 
for peace promotion in Somalia through the United Nations 
Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS).
