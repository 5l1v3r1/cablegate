¶1. (SBU) Summary: Italy is contributing a total of Euro 4.4 
million (approx $5.4 million) to relief efforts related to 
the crisis in Darfur.  Officials at the MFA's Directorate of 
Development Cooperation told USAID Deputy Administrator 
Frederick Schieck that Italy does not rule out further 
contributions.  For the GOI, non-food aid, such as medical 
care, is the higher priority in Darfur now.  Italy plans to 
send a coordinator from the Italian Ministry of Health to 
Khartoum to manage its bilateral assistance.  On Afghanistan, 
Schieck expressed hope that Italy would be able to command 
one provincial reconstruction team (PRT). End summary. 
 
Darfur, Libya Route For Aid 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Sudan was the primary topic at a May 27 meeting 
between USAID Deputy Administrator Frederick Schieck and 
Eugenio Campo, Multilateral Coordinator at the Directorate of 
Development Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Embassy Econoffs and FODAG Alternate Permrep also attended. 
Schieck described the terrible situation in the Darfur region 
of Sudan and the problems relief agencies are experiencing 
delivering aid during the rainy season.  The World Food 
Program (WFP), Schieck noted, is considering using a route 
through Libya that is less affected by weather.  Campo did 
not offer an opinion on the Libya route but noted the 
potential importance of the WFP's Humanitarian Resource Depot 
in Brindisi, Italy, for responding to the Darfur crisis. 
 
Breakdown of Italy's Darfur Pledge 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Gabriele Di Muzio, Africa Desk Director for 
Development Cooperation, outlined Italy's response to the 
Darfur crisis and provided a copy of an internal summary 
itemizing Italy's donations.  Di Muzio said Italy has pledged 
Euro 16 million in assistance to the Sudan (Note: We assume 
this means in the current fiscal year.  End note.) of which 
Euro 4.4 million is specifically in response to Darfur.  Di 
Muzio added that Italy does not rule out further 
contributions beyond the Euro 4.4 million already committed 
and an additional Euro 1.5 million donation is under 
discussion.  Additional donations, according to the paper, 
would be through multilateral, rather than bilateral, 
channels.  The paper does not specify how much of the Euro 
4.4 million has already been distributed.  The summary lists 
the following breakdown of Italy's Darfur pledge: 
 
(Euro=$1.23) 
 
channel                   m of Euro      m of US$ 
-------                   ---------      --------

GRAND TOTAL                4,399          5.41 
 
 
¶4. (U) Italy's priorities, Di Muzio said, are in the health 
sector: immunization, therapeutic feeding, safe drinking 
water, shelter and other non-food items.  Schieck commented 
that the delivery of non-food aid to Darfur and eastern Chad 
 
should be the priority.  Italy also plans to send an aid 
coordinator from the Ministry of Health to Khartoum to help 
manage Italy's response, according to Di Muzio.  Schieck 
noted the difficulty aid workers and foreign officials are 
having obtaining Sudanese visas.  Campo replied that the 
International Red Cross might be helpful in resolving the 
visa issue. 
 
Afghanistan 
----------- 
 
¶5. (U) Campo pointed out Italy's efforts promoting judicial 
reform in Afghanistan.  Italy, Campo said, is concerned with 
the repatriation of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran and 
decided in May to contribute Euro 3 million to the UNHCR. 
Italy also gave Euro 6 million in food aid to Afghanistan in 
2003 through the WFP.  Italy, Campo added, shares the United 
States' concern about continued opium cultivation in 
Afghanistan.  Schieck explained the concept behind provincial 
reconstruction teams (PRT's) that combine a military presence 
to maintain security along with a contingent of development 
workers to improve economic conditions.  Schieck expressed 
the USG's hope that Italy could take responsibility for one 
PRT. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Darfur is apparently rising as an aid priority for 
the GOI.  The Euro 4.4 million contribution is substantially 
higher than what the MFA reported to Econoff last month 
(reftel).  At the same time, given Italy's commitments in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, the MFA's aid budget is under greater 
strain than ever.  As with other aid programs, actual 
distribution of Italy's Darfur pledge may see some delay. 
 
¶7. (U) Deputy Administrator Schieck did not have the 
opportunity to clear this cable.
