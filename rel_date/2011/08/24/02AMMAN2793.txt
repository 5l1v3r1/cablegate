SUBJECT: JORDAN ASKS FOR USG SUPPORT ON OIOS AUDIT ISSUE AT 
JUNE 4 UNCC GC MEETING 
 
REF: A. GENEVA 1706 
     ¶B. GENEVA 1919 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request for the Department.  See 
paras 3-4 below. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Acting Foreign Minister Shaher Bak asked the 
Ambassador and PolCouns May 29 for USG support for Jordan's 
position in the upcoming June 4 meeting of the Governing 
Council (GC) of the UN Compensation Commission (UNCC).  Bak 
explained that the June 4 meeting would discuss an audit by 
the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) of a 
1999 UNCC award of USD 72 million to the Government of Jordan 
(see refs).  Bak explained that the OIOS audit concluded that 
the UNCC had overpaid Jordan by USD 46 million.  Reading from 
UNCC rules, Bak argued that all UNCC award decisions are 
final and cannot be appealed.  Bak asked for USG support for 
Jordan's position in the June 4 GC meeting.  The Ambassador 
undertook to get a position from Washington. 
 
¶3.  ACTION REQUEST:  Please advise on the USG's position on 
Jordan's case.  We note that para 3 of ref A contains 
"contingency talking points" for Geneva on this issue, as 
follows: 
 
--  The award to Jordan has been made, is final, and has been 
paid. 
 
--  The award cannot and should not be reopened. 
 
--  The UNCC acted within its authority with respect to the 
award. 
 
--  The U.S. supports the UNCC in general and the UNCC rule 
that awards are final. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Please advise whether Embassy Amman is authorized to 
use these points to respond to the GOJ's request for support.
