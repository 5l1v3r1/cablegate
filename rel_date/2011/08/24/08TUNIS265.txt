¶7. Entry requirements:  a valid passport is required; no visa is

¶9. Travelers with private or U.S. Government (USG) owned electronic 
devices including laptops, peripherals, diskettes, tapes, and other 
media, must receive RSO/ISSO authorization before these items can be 
allowed into Embassy facilities.  Classified computers must be sent 
to post via the classified diplomatic pouch, or be hand carried by a 
non-professional diplomatic courier.  All classified equipment must 
bear external USG bar-coded inventory numbers and classification 
marking commensurate with the highest level of information processed 
on the system.  Cellular/mobile phones and palm-pilots are 
prohibited in Controlled Access Areas.  Questions concerning other 
types of electronic devices and magnetic media may be directed to 
the ISSO or RSO.  Electricity in Tunisia is 220 Volts. 
 
¶10. Security/Crime Information: Tunisia is a moderate Arab country 
that has traditionally enjoyed peace and stability.  However, in 
light of the September 11 attacks in the United States and in view 
of the ongoing violence in Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere 
in the Middle East region, the American Embassy reminds visitors to 
maintain a high level of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to 
increase their security awareness.  While the Government of Tunisia 
has and will continue to make every effort to protect foreigners, 
visitors should avoid large crowds and crowded public areas and keep 
in regular contact with the Embassy. 
 
¶11. Tunisian security forces are omnipresent and generally ensure 
public order.  Low level, non-violent property crimes of opportunity 
are relatively common.  Pickpockets and purse-snatchers are common 
in areas with high volume tourist traffic, such as the Tunis Medina 
(old city) and central market.  It is prudent to exercise normal 
travel security precautions and maintain a low profile as one would 
in any major U.S. city.  This should help to ensure an incident-free 
visit.
