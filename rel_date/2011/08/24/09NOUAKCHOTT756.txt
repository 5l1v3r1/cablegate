REF: STATE 118799 
 
1.(SBU) Ambassador drew on Ref talking points to demarche 
Foreign Minister Naha Mint Mouknass on November 23. 
Minister Mouknass listened attentively and assured 
Ambassador that she would give our views careful 
consideration.  She dismissed much of the anti-Israel 
activity as "playing for the gallery" but agreed that it 
was not useful for Israel to feel that "its back was 
against the wall."  Acknowledging that both sides in the 
conflict had rights and obligations, she urged that the USG 
press for more responsible Israeli behavior which would in 
turn "enable Arab governments to get better behavior from 
the Palestinians." 
 
2.(SBU) Highlighting USG concerns about the three 
resolutions dealing with UN bodies focused exclusively on 
Palestinian issues, Ambassador urged that Mauritania 
abstain or be absent for these votes.  Minister Mouknass 
acknowledged the request but made no commitments.
