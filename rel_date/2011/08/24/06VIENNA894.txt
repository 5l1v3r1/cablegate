¶1.  As of December 2005, Austria has disbursed Euro 1.5 
million (USD 1.8 million) in technical assistance to Iraq, 
according to Lydia Saadat, the MFA's Assistance Coordinator 
for the Middle East and Asia.  (Saadat's department is 
updating figures for the first quarter of 2006).  Austria 
had pledged Euro 1.7 million (USD 2.0 million) in technical 
assistance at the Madrid Conference in 2003, and gradually 
increased this amount to Euro 2.4 million (USD 2.9 million). 
Thus, approximately 900,000 Euro (USD 1.1 million) remain to 
be disbursed. 
 
¶2.  In addition, Austria had pledged Euro 4.5 million (USD 
5.4 million) in "infrastructure assistance."  Saadat said 
Austria would not disburse these funds.  Instead the GOA has 
added the amount to its debt relief program with Iraq 
(remission of a total of Euro 1.7 billion or USD 2.1 
billion), which the GOA signed with Iraq in December 2005. 
Austria had also pledged Euro 10.2 million (USD 12.2 
million) in export credit guarantees at the Madrid 
conference.  However, the Austrian Control Bank, which 
administers the money, suspended issuing export guarantees 
because the Control Bank does not consider the Trade Bank of 
Iraq, the Iraqi entity overseeing the management of 
government contracts, to be a reliable business partner (ref 
B). 
 
¶3.  Completed Austrian projects include evacuation and 
emergency response activities, and training for young Iraqi 
diplomats.  There are two major ongoing Austrian assistance 
activities.  One is the Austrian-Slovenian project 
"Psychological Support for children and Families in Iraq". 
The other one is an "adopt-a-hospital" project 
(rehabilitation of basic health care within the Shatra 
region.  Austria has suspended the second phase of the 
"adopt-a-hospital" project because of security concerns. 
Another ongoing project is a reconstruction of facilities at 
the "Borsippa" archeological excavation site "Borsippa".
