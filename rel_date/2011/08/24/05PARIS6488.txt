SUBJECT: NO FRENCH COMMERCIAL SOURCES OF VEGETARIAN MRES 
 
REF: STATE 175147 
 
Per ref request, we checked with French MFA and MOD 
contacts, but preliminary information indicates that French 
MREs pose two problems: they are not produced by commercial 
sources, and they are generally not vegetarian.  The MFA 
promised to investigate the matter further, and we will 
relay any information we get.
