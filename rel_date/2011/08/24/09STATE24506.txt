SUBJECT: GUIDANCE: CSW RESOLUTION ON PALESTINIAN WOMEN 
 
¶1. (SBU) USUN should call for a vote and vote against the 
resolution before the UN Commission on the Status of Women 
(CSW) on the "Situation of and Assistance to Palestinian 
Women." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mission is authorized to draw on previously cleared 
Departmental press guidance and Mission's Explanation of Vote 
(EOV) on the resolution on this topic presented at the 2008 
CSW session in presenting an EOV this year.  In presenting an 
EOV, Mission should prominently note that the universalist 
values of the CSW render it inappropriate for it to single 
out, for narrow political reasons, the circumstances of one 
population of women, when many other populations of women 
around the world also face unique and challenging 
circumstances.
