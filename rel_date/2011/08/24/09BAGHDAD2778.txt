The Honorable Barack Obama, 
President of the United States of America 
Washington, D.C. 
 
Allow me Mr. President to congratulate you on receiving the 
Nobel Prize.  Diplomacy is indeed the choice to approach 
international issues and challenges.  Diplomacy, cooperation, 
and a world that is not threatened of destruction by nuclear 
weapons is a better world.  Such an approach will give a 
great space for peoples of the world to come closer, and 
shall provide for sustainable solutions to issues with 
minimal losses and pains. 
 
I am confident that such an approach to international issues 
will positively impact bilateral relations between our 
countries. 
 
Sincerely, 
(signed) 
 
Tariq Al-Hashimi, 
Vice President 
The Republic of Iraq
