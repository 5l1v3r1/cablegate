Botswana remains committed to working with SADC, the 
international community and the United States in particular, 
to finding a lasting solution to the crises in Zimbabwe. 
 
It is important that the United States continue to play a 
constructive role in an overall effort to bring about the 
restoration of peace and stability to the Republic of 
Zimbabwe. 
 
Please accept, Madame Secretary, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Yours sincerely,
