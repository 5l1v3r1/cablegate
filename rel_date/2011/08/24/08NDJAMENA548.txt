 Acting PolEconOff delivered demarche to the MFA Director of 
Bilateral Cooperation, Oumar Noury Abdelkerim, on November 
Â¶20.  Mr. Abdelkerim took note of the points, and advised that 
he would pass the matter to the Minister so that instructions 
could be issued to Chad's mission in New York. Mr. Abdelkerim 
would have preferred, however, that we had given him detailed 
information on the resolutions that are to be considered 
during the current UNGA session, as opposed to those that 
passed during the 62nd session.
