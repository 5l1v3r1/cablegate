U.S. FINANCIAL CRISIS HAS 
NO IMPACT ON BANKING SECTOR 
--------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Central Bank of Lebanon (CBL) Governor Riad Salameh 
reportedly said that the banking and financial crisis in the U.S. 
will not have an impact on Lebanon's banking sector.  A survey by 
the Banking Control Commission (BCC) showed that banks in Lebanon 
were not involved directly or indirectly with the U.S. financial 
institutions under crisis, and there is no fear this crisis will 
impact banks in Lebanon, a senior BCC source told us.  The source 
attributed this to the low sophistication of Lebanon's banking 
sector, and the fact that the CBL issued several circulars setting a 
cap on banks' exposure to certain financial products.  Meanwhile, 
the BCC recently sent banks a detailed questionnaire about their 
relationship with every commercial and investment bank, as well as 
financial institutions abroad, the source confided. 
 
OBSTACLES TO BALANCING PUBLIC FINANCES REMAIN, 
INFLATION EXPECTED AT 11 PERCENT IN 2008 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) In an interview with French-language daily L'Orient du Jour, 
Finance Minister Mohammad Chatah noted that the three main obstacles 
to balancing public finances were transfers to public utility 
Electricity du Liban (EDL), debt service, and the recently approved 
increase of public sector salaries.  Chatah estimated that EDL 
losses would increase, though he expects some reforms to take place 
in the electricity sector in the coming months. 
 
¶3. (U) Regarding debt service, Chatah did not provide figures, but 
noted that the projected rise in international interest rates, as 
well as expected rise in the budget deficit, would increase debt 
service.  Additionally, he expected the wage increase to cst the 
GOL $500 million per year and lead to infationary pressures, 
pushing inflation to a projeted 11 percent in 2008.  Chatah said 
the value-added tax would not be raised from ten to 12 percent in 
the near future, but noted that the five percent tax on interest on 
bank deposits will be increased to seven percent, bringing between 
$150 million and $200 million into the treasury. 
 
IMF TEAM IN BEIRUT TO 
PREPARE FOR NEW EPCA 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) An IMF delegation will be in Beirut September 22 for a 
two-week visit to prepare for a new Emergency Post Conflict 
Assistance (EPCA) program, a senior Finance Ministry source told us. 
 The delegation will review macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary 
indicators.  This visit precedes the visit of Finance Minister 
Mohammad Chatah to the World Bank/IMF annual meetings in Washington 
early October, where he plans formally to request another EPCA 
agreement to replace the previous one that expired in December 
¶2007. 
 
NUMBER OF TOURISTS RISE BY 29 PERCENT 
DURING FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF 2008 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) According to the Ministry of Tourism, Lebanon saw a 29.2 
percent increase in tourists in the first eight months of 2008 
compared to the year before, as relative political stability revived 
the tourism sector.  In August 2008 alone, the number of visitors 
reached 195,149, an increase of 33.59 percent from the same period 
in 2007.  The largest increase in August visitors came from North 
America (a 44.5 percent increase, year on year), followed by Arabs

(40.7 percent increase), Europeans (29 percent increase) and Asians 
(20 percent increase). 
 
PARLIAMENT LOOKS INTO 
ELECTRICITY SECTOR REFORM 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) For the first time, parliament hosted a two-day workshop 
(September 15-16) to coordinate among various stakeholders on 
options for restructuring power utility Electricity du Liban (EDL), 
attracting private sector investments to meet increased demand, and 
addressing EDL's persistent deficits.  Speakers included head of 
parliamentary public works, energy, and transportation committee MP 
Mohammad Kabbani, Minister of Energy and Water Alain Tabourian, 
Finance Minister Mohamad Chatah, EDL Chairman Kamal Hayek, Council 
for Development and Reconstruction president Nabil el-Jisr, Higher 
Council for Privatization (HCP) Secretary General Ziad Hayek, in 
addition to World Bank and IFC experts.  Recommendations will be 
issued in three weeks, MP Kabbani said. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Although GE Energy was initially scheduled to make a 
presentation at the workshop, the company decided not to 
participate, as no other private sector supplier would be speaking. 
Meanwhile, GE Energy Regional General Manager Jean-Claude Nasr told 
the Ambassador of GE's interest in re-equipping a new power plant in 
Deir Ammar (northern Lebanon) that the GOL plans to contract to the 
private sector. 
 
62 PERCENT OF PLEDGED POST-2006 
WAR SUPPORT RECEIVED TO DATE 
-------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) According to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), around 1.3 
billion dollars, or 62 percent of pledged support to Lebanon since 
the July 2006 war, has been signed into agreements as of August 
2008, covering emergency relief, humanitarian assistance, recovery, 
and reconstruction.  The GOL received $811 million in direct 
assistance from Saudi Arabia ($590 million), Kuwait ($82 million), 
Oman ($50 million), Iraq ($37 million), the UAE ($15 million), the 
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development ($10 million), and 
Italy ($7 million).  Other reconstruction and humanitarian aid 
projects were financed by Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, and the European 
Center for Humanitarian Services.  The UN and Lebanese Recovery Fund 
received around $143 million (from Spain, Australia, Canada, Italy 
and Sweden), while NGOs received $39 million, mainly from the 
Italian ROSS Emergency Program.  Other projects were also signed 
between Iran, Belgium, and Italy and the Council for Development and 
Reconstruction (CDR). 
 
FITCH RATINGS AFFIRMS 
SOVEREIGN DEBT AT B- 
-------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) On September 12, Fitch Ratings affirmed Lebanon's long-term 
foreign and local currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at B-.  The 
short-term foreign currency IDR was affirmed at B and the country 
ceiling was affirmed at B-.  According to the report, Lebanon's 
rating reflects the highest public debt burden and budget deficit of 
any sovereign rated by Fitch, although it noted that the country has 
a flawless debt service record.  Fitch estimated the budget deficit 
at 11.1 percent of GDP in 2007, with GDP growth over four percent. 
 
 
LEBANON IMPROVES SLIGHTLY IN 
CREDITWORTHINESS SURVEY 
-------------------- 
 
¶10. (U) In the Institutional Investor magazine's semi-annual 
creditworthiness survey, Lebanon ranked 113 out of 177 countries 
worldwide and 16 among 20 MENA countries.  This is considered as a 
slight improvement compared to the previous survey in March, when 
Lebanon ranked 115 worldwide and 16 within the MENA region.  The 
survey rates creditworthiness of countries on a scale of zero to 
100, with 100 representing countries with the least chance of debt 
default.
