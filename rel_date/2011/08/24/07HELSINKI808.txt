REF: STATE 147620 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy delivered subject demarche Oct. 23 to the 
Finnish MFA's Unit for Human Rights.  On Oct. 31 Deputy 
Director Kirsti Pohjankukka contacted Polchief to offer an 
undate on internal GoF deliberations as well as the GoF's 
discussions with its EU Partners of subject issue. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Pohjankukka welcomed both the tone and substance of 
reftel points, including in particular our suggestions for 
fostering internal dialogue between the GOC and civil 
society; access for rapporteurs; and political prisoners. 
She said that there was general consensus within the GoF on 
the need for "some action" outside the HRC framework on all 
these issues.  She could not yet offer a specific sense of 
overall EU thinking on these possibilities, but said that 
there was a "sense" within the EU as well that some measures 
needed to be put in place on these key human rights issues in 
the absense of a mechanism with the HRC.
