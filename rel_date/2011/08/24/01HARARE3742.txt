¶1.   THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" USED 
   ITS DECEMBER 15 EDITORIAL TO HAIL THE JUST-ENDED FIFTH 
   ZANU PF NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONFERENCE IN VICTORIA FALLS 
   AS "A RALLYING POINT" FOR THE RULING PARTY TO FIGHT 
   "21ST CENTURY BRITISH AND AMERICAN IMPERIALISM."  UNDER 
   HEADLINE "BLACKMAIL OF SANCTIONS WON'T WORK," THE PAPER 
   COMMENTS: 
 
¶2.   ". . .CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS THAT THE BLACKMAIL 
   SANCTIONS BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WOULD DAMPEN THE 
   SPIRIT OF ZIMBABWEANS AND TURN THEM AGAINST THEIR 
   GOVERNMENT, THE OPPOSITE HAS HAPPENED.  THE PEOPLE'S 
   RESOLVE HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED AND THE ENEMY HAS PLAYED HIS 
   HAND.  IT IS NOW CLEAR FOR EVERYONE TO SEE WHO HAS BEEN 
   BEHIND THEIR SUFFERING AND TO WHAT EXTENT THESE FORCES ARE 
   PREPARED TO GO TO MAINTAIN THEIR STRANGLEHOLD ON THE 
   ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMY WHILE THE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO GO HUNGRY 
   AND POOR.  THE CONFERENCE (FIFTH ZANU PF NATIONAL PEOPLE'S 
   CONFERENCE) HAS PROVIDED A RALLYING POINT FOR THE RULING 
   PARTY TO LEAD THE COUNTRY IN ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST THIS 21ST 
   CENTURY BRITISH AND AMERICAN IMPERIALISM. . . ."
