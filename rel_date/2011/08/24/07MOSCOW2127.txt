REF:  STATE 58735 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On May 4 we shared reftel message on continued G8 support 
for global malaria control programs with Russian Government 
officials at the MFA's International Organizations Department, the 
Health and Social Development Ministry's International Department, 
and the International Department of the Federal Surveillance Service 
for Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being 
(Rospotrebnadzor).  On May 8 Senior Counselor Nikita Sikachov in the 
MFA's International Department told us that Russia does not plan to 
make additional commitments on malaria in the near term beyond the 
$20 million already committed as part of the infectious diseases 
focus of Russia's 2006 G8 Presidency.
