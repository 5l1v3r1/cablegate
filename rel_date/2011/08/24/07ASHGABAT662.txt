SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) Media coverage of U.S. CENTCOM Commander Admiral William 
Fallon's June 20 meeting with Turkmenistan's President Gurbanguly 
Berdimuhamedov fell into two distinct trends, with international 
sources focusing on American competition with Russia for gas 
resources while state media concentrated on Turkmenistan's security 
partnership with the United States and Turkmenistan's support for 
Afghanistan.  International media framed the meeting in the context 
of Russian and U.S. competition for pipeline construction while 
minimally discussing the security relationship.  The exception to 
this was a New York Times article by C.J. Chivers that presented 
numerous security details.  The state media praised the security 
relationship in the context of issues important to the general 
population: counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, and border 
security.  As could be expected, state media also continuously 
emphasized Fallon's compliments, Turkmenistan's aid to Afghanistan, 
and continued peaceful relations with their neighbors.  End 
Summary. 
 
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA: MORE OF THE UNIMAGINATIVE GREAT GAME 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Thorough and accurate coverage of the visit came from New 
York Times reporter C.J. Chivers in a June 21 article that refrained 
from directly criticizing the current regime.  The article 
highlighted the U.S. and Turkmenistani governments' positive view of 
the meeting, but dedicated most of its content to background 
information on the country, regime, gas pipelines, and the security 
relationship with the United States.  The article directly attacked 
Niyazov's policies while neutrally describing the current president, 
noting announced reforms and citing all criticisms of Berdimuhamedov 
back to human rights groups and opposition members.  Chivers used 
quotes by Admiral Fallon to show U.S. eagerness to engage with 
Turkmenistan, while the final quote illustrated U.S. sensitivity in 
pressing human rights issues.  An abstract of this article contained 
the same tone.  The International Herald Tribune published a 
shortened version of this article that cut out most of the details 
of U.S.-Turkmenistan security relationship but still carried the 
emphasis on the possible development of a Trans-Caspian pipeline. 
 
¶3.  (U) A June 21 Associated Press article by Alexander Vershinin 
focused on how Fallon's visit was part of a competition between 
Russia and the U.S. for influence in Turkmenistan.  The article drew 
most of its information on the actual meeting from positive 
quotations in Turkmenistan state media sources.  Vershinin also 
cited the New York Times article's mention of Fallon pushing a 
Trans-Caspian pipeline and the president's hesitation on the issue. 
Vershinin added that the state media did not mention this portion of 
the meeting.  The article continued to emphasize the vast energy 
wealth of the region as the prize in a new 'Great Game,' but also 
noted the positive role Turkmenistan played in stabilizing 
Afghanistan as another reason for U.S. interest in the country. 
 
¶4.  (U) A brief piece by Radio Free Europe stated that 
Berdimuhamedov supported the stabilization of Afghanistan, a 
Trans-Caspian pipeline, and expanding relations with the United 
States government and businesses during his meeting with Fallon. 
News Central Asia published a piece (also carried by The Journal of 
Turkish weekly) that drew heavily on state media sources to give 
another positive assessment of the growing cooperation between the 
two countries.  The article ended with incorrect speculation that 
Admiral Fallon would be returning in a week for more meetings. 
(Note:  The positive tone of the News Central Asia article was out 
of character, as this source typically carries an anti-western 
slant.  However, it did maintain its pro-Government of Turkmenistan 
perspective.  End Note.)

¶5.  (U) Russian Itar-Tass News agency (Russian) on June 20 and 
Xinhua News Agency (Chinese-origin/Russian-language) on June 21, 
based on news reports from Turkmenistan's state media, reported on 
Admiral Fallon's visit with similar content to the State Watan TV 
News broadcast.  Both news agencies reported that Fallon praised 
Turkmenistan's role in the peaceful development of Afghanistan, with 
exports of electricity and natural gas. 
 
STATE MEDIA: TURKMENISTAN, SAVIOR OF AFGHANISTAN 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶6.  (U) The state Watan TV News program's June 20 news-broadcast 
highlighted Fallon's positive comments on the regime and the 
benefits of the U.S.-Turkmenistan security relationship, and carried 
most of his interview with reporters.  The broadcast stated that 
Fallon had congratulated the president on his election and expressed 
confidence in the president's ability to develop the country 
rapidly.  The interlocutors had discussed many issues but security 
had been the chief topic.  Fallon and the president had focused the 
security discussion on cooperation in fighting terrorism, protecting 
borders, and preventing narcotics trafficking, as these phenomena 
would quickly destabilize the country.  President Berdimuhamedov had 
emphasized the importance of political neutrality, especially in 
regards to remaining on good terms with its neighbors.  Fallon had 
praised Turkmenistan's role in developing peace in Afghanistan while 
President Berdimuhamedov had noted the gas and supplies they had 
given to their neighbor.  Fallon had said that he was satisfied with 
the meeting and overall with the country of Turkmenistan.  Watan 
then broadcasted most of Fallon's interview that emphasized the 
benefits of security and his compliments of the country, its people, 
and president.  The broadcast ended with a reaffirmation of the 
president's policy of neutrality and peaceful cooperation with all 
of its neighbors.  (Comment:  The interview appears edited for 
brevity, not to censor sensitive content.  End Comment.) 
 
¶7.  (U) Russia-based pro-Turkmenistan news website Turkmenistan.ru 
published a short piece focusing on how the meeting will strengthen 
the positive security relationship between the two countries.  The 
article carried a quote by Fallon emphasizing how the cooperation 
will assist both countries in combating terrorism, stopping drug 
trafficking, and securing borders.  The article noted Turkmenistan's 
role in promoting peace in Afghanistan and supplying them with gas 
and electricity. 
 
¶8.  (U) On June 21, state dailies "Neutral Turkmenistan" (Russian, 
circ. 35,141) and "Turkmenistan" (Turkmen, circ. 28,091) gave a 
front page treatment to an article with a similar content to the 
Watan TV News broadcast.  In subsequent days, state weeklies "Watan" 
(Turkmen, circ. 26,091), "Nesli" (Turkmen, circ. 22,311), "Ashgabat" 
(Turkmen, circ. 16,171), "Balkan" (Turkmen, circ. 24,630), "Ahal 
Durmushy" (Turkmen, circ. 35,391), "Maru-Shahu Jahan" (Turkmen, 
circ. 36,220), "Turkmen Gundogary" (Turkmen, circ. 44,160), 
"Dashoguz Habarlary" (Turkmen, circ. 27,070) and "Habarlar" 
(Turkmen, circ. 3,596) also gave front page treatment to the same 
article from the dailies. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Admiral Fallon's meeting with Turkmenistan's President 
received positive coverage in state media sources and generally 
neutral, pipeline-centered coverage in international media.  While 
the Turkmenistan state media praised this partnership, they also 
carefully and continuously defined the limited nature of the 
relationship and the importance of maintaining permanent neutrality. 
 This indicates a positive governmental view of the United States, 
while exposing Turkmenistan's desire to maintain a balancing act 
 
ASHGABAT 00000662  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
amongst regional powers. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) In contrast to press following a visit by CENTCOM 
commander Abizaid two years ago, post was surprised that Russian 
media outlets did not use the Fallon visit as an opportunity to 
speculate about sinister U.S. military motives in the region.  It is 
unclear whether this was the result of an improved 
Turkmenistan-Russia relationship or because Russian news media was 
occupied with other news stories.  End Comment.
