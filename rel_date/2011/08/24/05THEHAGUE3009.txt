Â¶1. (SBU) On November 1, POLCOUNS delivered reftel points and 
Secretary Rice's statement on the results of the 
 
SIPDIS 
Constitutional Referendum in Iraq to Willemijn Kallenberg 
(Iraq Desk Officer, Dutch MFA).  In response to POLCOUNS' 
questions, Kallenberg said she was not aware of any 
"official" Dutch reaction to the election, although she 
stressed that the GONL was pleased with the result.  She 
noted that there would be an opportunity for the EU to 
discuss the results at the upcoming November 7 GAERC meeting, 
and stated that the Dutch would support a positive EU 
statement.  POLCOUNS noted that the GAERC usually provided 
opportunities for individual ministers to address the press 
separately and asked whether FM Bot could make a supportive 
statement in that context; Kallenberg assured POLCOUNS that 
he would be prepared to do so "if asked."
