Â¶1.  POST WISHES TO NOMINATE ELISA SALVADOR, SENIOR IV 
FSN, MADRID, SPAIN FOR THE CONSULAR SENIOR IV FSN 
WORKSHOP. SHE WAS NOT SELECTED IN 2002 OR 2003. PLEASE 
SEE INFORMATION REGARDING CANDIATE BELOW; 
 
A) Salvador, Elisa 
 
B) Grade:08/06 
 
C) Alcy R. Frelick, Counselor for Consular Affairs 
 
D) DPOB: May 11, 1953, Calahorra, La Rioja, Spain. PPT 
51317578-R, Spain 
 
E) RAMC Employee Number: 008042290 
 
F) English Level: 4/3+ 
 
G) Description of duties performed at present: IV FSN 
Supervisor, directs IV and DV processing at post. 
Supervises one FSN and provides guidance and advice to 
First and Second tour FSOs.  She is the principal 
liaison with the DHS office at post for handling 
immigrant visa petitions and waivers.  She also serves 
as post's liaison with the Consular Support Help Desk, 
the National Visa Center's IV Unit, and KCC. 
 
In liaison with Public Affairs, Elisa coordinates the 
consular public information disseminated by post 
through Embassy Website, telephone scripts for the 
umbrella European visa information contractor (post's 
visa information and appointment line), and printed 
information.  She is the senior FSN in the post Fraud 
Prevention Unit.  She creates and maintains FPU files 
containing information from State and DHS. She attends 
all anti-fraud meetings, and builds contacts with local 
police, airport personnel, and Civil Guard. In the 
absence of the FPU FSO, she coordinates all anti fraud 
activities for the consular section.  Elisa serves as 
post's resident expert on trafficking in person's 
issues. 
 
With significant numbers of Latin American, North 
African, Eastern European, and Sub-Saharan immigrants 
in Spain, the Immigrant Visa unit is a wider range of 
nationalities applying for immigrant visas.  This 
influx of third country national immigrant visa 
applicant requires her to track trends in immigration 
to Spain, terrorist reporting, and organized crime 
patterns. 
 
H) Length of service: 30 Years (1974) 
 
Elisa has worked in different consular units.  She has 
worked the past four (4) years in the IV unit. 
 
I) Prior Participation: 
 
  FSI FSN Fraud Prevention Course Jan29 - Feb2,2001 
 
J) Last visit to DC area: January 2001. 
 
K) Post Justification of nomination: Elisa is truly the 
FSN post turns to first to handle a wide variety of 
consular related issues.  She is engaged, interested 
and anxious for this training opportunity. 
Her English is excellent.  She has specific 
responsibilities for Immigrant Visas and the Fraud 
Prevention Program; however, Elisa has previously 
worked in American Citizen Services and currently works 
closely with the Non-Immigrant Visa unit. This broad 
perspective on consular issues makes her an extremely 
valuable staff member. 
 
Elisa's opportunity for training has consisted solely 
of Fraud Prevention training.  Her experience at that 
conference truly transformed Post's fraud prevention 
program to one that is not only active but emphasizes 
liaison and cooperation with host country officials. 
Her efforts and contacts in this area resulted in the 
Embassy sending our first International Visitor in the 
area of trafficking in persons.  Her contributions to 
the annual trafficking in person's report were 
remarkable - she provided key contacts, information, 
and trends to the political officer drafting the 
report. 
 
Elisa would have a great deal to contribute to the 
conference and would benefit from being exposed to 
ideas from other posts. While she has extensive 
experience at post, with four/4 years in Immigrant Visa 
work, she is still young enough to anticipate many 
years of productive service ahead. The visit to to DHS 
in Vermont would be particularly useful due to the 
close collaboration needed in Madrid between the IV 
section and the DHS Office. She is a strong candidate 
and eager for this training opportunity. 
L) Round trip airfare: approximately $720.00
