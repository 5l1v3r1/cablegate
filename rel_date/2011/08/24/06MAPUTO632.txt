SUBJECT: MOZAMBIQUE-ZIMBABWE JOINT DEFENSE AND SECURITY 
COMMISSION MEET IN MAPUTO; CROSS-BORDER ISSUES DISCUSSED 
 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified -- Handle Accordingly. 
 
¶1. (U) The Mozambique-Zimbabwe Joint Defense and Security 
Commission met on May 31 and June 1 in Maputo to discuss 
defense and security concerns currently facing the two 
neighboring countries.  The meeting, which brought together 
senior-level officials from both governments, covered a range 
of topics including cross-border crime, trafficking of 
weapons and drugs, HIV/AIDS, natural disasters, and the 
movement of people and goods.  Both the Zimbabwean Minister 
of Defense, Sydney Sekeramayi and Mozambican Minister of 
Defense, Tobias Dai were in attendance. 
 
¶2. (U) Speaking to reporters on June 1, Minister Dai stated 
that both governments were concerned with reinforcing their 
shared border, with a specific focus on the free movement of 
people and goods.  According to local press reports, both 
governments have agreed to create more border posts along the 
Mozambique-Zimbabwe border to better control such movement. 
Post understands that discussions on the demarcation of the 
shared border, as well as elimination of tourist visas, also 
took place during the two-day session. 
 
¶3. (SBU) During a televised interview, Minister Sekeramayi 
also expressed the need to improve communications and 
cooperation between the Mozambican and Zimbabwean militaries 
as a means of increasing control of cross-border traffic. 
(Note: During Mozambique's civil war, a large contingent of 
Zimbabwean soldiers was deployed along the Beira Corridor and 
joint air force operations were conducted against RENAMO 
bases in Sofala, Manica and Zambezia provinces.  Joint 
military cooperation since the end of the civil war in 1992 
has declined significantly.  In the past two years there have 
been an increased number of reports in the local press of 
abuse against civilians by military and public security 
organs on both sides of the border.  End Note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Since the onset of the crisis in Zimbabwe, 
Mozambique has experienced an influx of Zimbabwean refugees 
entering the country, many of whom cross the border 
illegally.  The movement of contraband between the two 
neighboring countries has also reportedly increased due to 
the economic and political upheaval in Zimbabwe.  As the 
Guebuza administration works to strengthen its ability to 
patrol its lengthy borders and coastline it is only natural 
that the GRM would look to Zimbabwe for cooperation and 
support, considering the countries' close economic ties and 
shared political struggles.
