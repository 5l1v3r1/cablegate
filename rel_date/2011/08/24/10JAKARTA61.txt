SUBJECT:  INDONESIA SENDS GENEROUS ASSISTANCE TO HAITI 
 
INDONESIA REACTS QUICKLY 
------------------------ 
 
¶1. Indonesia plans to send 1.6 million dollars worth of assistance 
to Haiti on January 16.  The team is waiting for their visas to be 
issued.  (Note: Indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with 
Haiti and therefore the team will be issued visas in New York.) 
 
EXPERTS AND GOODS ARE SENT 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. Indonesia is sending a team made up of 75 people from the 
Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Health and Public Works. 
Their areas of expertise are medicine, search and rescue, 
telecommunications and construction.  Additionally, the GOI is 
providing 15 tents, 3 tons of medical supplies, 5 tons of baby and 
children supplies, dried food, 1 ambulance, 1 truck and 1 water 
purifier. 
 
INDONESIA HISTORICALLY GENEROUS PROVIDER 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. Foreign Minister Natalegawa stated that Indonesia has been 
devastated by a similar situation and can empathize with the 
suffering of the people of Haiti.  Indonesia has generously provided 
its expertise and goods to countries that have suffered from natural 
disasters, most recently to Burma (1 million USD), and China (1.5 
million USD).  The GOI offered assistance to the U.S. following 
Hurricane Katrina. 
 
POSSIBLE ROLE OF ACS AGREEMENT 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  Emboff informed the National Body for Disaster Mitigation (BNPB) 
of the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement (ACSA), which was 
signed by the U.S. and Indonesian Defense Departments on December 9. 
 Emboff explained that the ACSA may provide logistics service and 
support to Indonesian Defense Forces (TNI) operating in Haiti. 
(Note: The Indonesians will use a military C-130 to send in their 
personnel and supplies.)  The BNPB was pleased to learn of this 
agreement and will follow-up with the TNI.
