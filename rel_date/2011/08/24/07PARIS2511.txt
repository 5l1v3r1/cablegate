FORCING A VOTE 
 
REF: STATE 80095 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche on June 11 to MFA 
IO DAS-Equivalent for Human Rights Jacques Pellet.  Pellet 
stated that France wanted to maintain the country-specific 
rapporteur mandates, consistent with the EU position.  Pellet 
equally agreed on the necessity to avoid any specific 
anti-Israel permanent agenda items.  "These are red lines," 
he stated. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response to the request that France call for a 
vote in the event of an unsatisfactory final package, Pellet 
took note but stated outright that France believed the Human 
Rights Council must be built up on the basis of consensus.
