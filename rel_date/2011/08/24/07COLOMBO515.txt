BANK SEPAH LINKS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 40440 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche to the new 
director of Sri Lanka's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), G. 
Karunaratne, and his deputy, Ravindra Jayaratne, on March 30. 
 Econoff noted that, according to the Bankers' Almanac, Bank 
Sepah is believed to maintain either a branch, subsidiary, or 
correspondent relationship with the Bank of Ceylon in 
Colombo. Econoff emphasized that UNSCR 1747 required Sri 
Lanka to freeze any accounts related to Bank Sepah and that, 
for the freeze to have its desired effect, Sri Lanka must act 
quickly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Karunaratne replied that he understood the binding 
nature of UNSCR 1747 and would give the issue "highest 
priority." He assured Econoff that the FIU would quickly 
ascertain which Sri Lankan banks, if any, conducted 
commercial, foreign exchange, or capital market transactions 
with Bank Sepah.  The FIU would do this by communicating with 
individual banks and the Sri Lanka Bankers' Association. 
Karunaratne was confident that the FIU would be able to get 
an order requiring any bank doing business with Bank Sepah to 
terminate its banking relationship.  He believed it would 
take somewhat longer to find any Bank Sepah assets that might 
lie within the Sri Lankan banking system, but he would begin 
the process immediately.  He regretted that the next normal 
business day, Monday April 2, was a Sri Lankan government and 
commercial holiday, which would somewhat slow the FIU's 
efforts, but he promised to provide an update later that week.
