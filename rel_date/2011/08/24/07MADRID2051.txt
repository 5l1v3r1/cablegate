REF: STATE 149107 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) EconOff delivered reftel demarche on October 29 to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Deputy Director for Economic 
Multilateral Relations Juan Luis Munoz de Laborde as well as 
to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Works' Deputy 
Directorate for Civil Aviation Operations.  Both Ministries 
were unaware of the proposal to amend the Montreal Convention 
by prohibiting the unauthorized transport via civil aircraft 
of explosives and weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and 
other materials, equipment, and technology related to WMD. 
 
¶2. (U) EconOff forwarded the text of the amendment to both 
Ministries on October 30, noting that the U.S. would be 
supporting this proposal during the upcoming November 
discussions in the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO) council.  EconOff requested Spain's support on this 
added civil aviation security measure. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Jose Manuel Puente, ICAO security lead from the 
Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Works and MFA's Juan 
Luis Munoz de Laborde commented that although in principal 
Spain is interested in strengthening civil aviation security 
measures, they would be unable to comment on Spain's support 
for the amendment until they had an opportunity to analyze 
the proposal and vet it through the appropriate channels. 
The Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Works' Directorate 
of Civil Aviation leads Spain's efforts on all ICAO matters 
in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Post 
will follow up with both entities in the upcoming weeks.
