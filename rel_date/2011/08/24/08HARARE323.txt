On the Political/Social Front 
----------------------------- 
3.Election Results Still Pending ... As Zimbabwe ends its second 
week without the announcement of official results in the March 29 
presidential election, rumors of runoffs, recounts and reruns 
continue to swirl.  The Herald reported today that the Zimbabwe 
Electoral Commission (ZEC) had taken the position it could not 
announce presidential election results until the completion of the 
court hearing on the MDC's application to compel the ZEC to announce 
results.  The hearing ended yesterday; the judge presiding over the 
case indicated he would give his judgment on the morning of April 
¶14. 
 
¶4. Regional Engagement On Zimbabwe...  In advance of the April 12 
emergency SADC summit on Zimbabwe to be held in Lusaka, Zambia (see 
Lusaka 412), the MDC spent much of the week on a regional diplomatic 
tour, appealing to Zimbabwe's neighbors for assistance in concluding 
the election.  MDC presidential candidate Morgan Tsvangirai, met 
with South Africa's ANC president Jacob Zuma and President of 
Botswana Ian Khama (see Gaborone 264).  Tsvangirai reportedly plans 
to travel to Mozambique to meet President Armando Guebuza before 
arriving in Lusaka for the SADC summit and a meeting with Zambian 
President and SADC Chairman Levy Mwanawasa.  The Zimbabwe 
Independent reported that Mugabe also planned attend this weekend's 
summit, equipped with a "dossier" defending the delay in releasing 
results and ZANU-PF's calls for a recount.  Meanwhile, MDC Secretary 
General Tendai Biti held a press conference in South Africa to 
announce that the MDC would not participate in a runoff, contending 
that Tsvangirai won the presidential contest outright.  The MDC made 
similar claims in previous elections, including the March 29 
contest, before ultimately deciding to participate and many believe 
the MDC is once again posturing. 
 
¶5. Electoral Commission Under Fire...  The Zimbabwe Electoral 
Commission (ZEC) has drawn a spate of criticism for disbanding its 
 
HARARE 00000323  002 OF 003 
 
 
central command center, where votes from the March 29 election were 
being counted, in favor of returning to its main offices.  The move 
comes amid calls for results to be released by the international 
community and ongoing deliberation by the High Court on an MDC 
petition for the court to compel ZEC to release their results.  ZEC 
claims that it is continuing to count votes and has not yet begun 
the verification process.  Under fire from both sides, several ZEC 
officials and poll workers have been arrested by the Mugabe regime 
for allegedly prejudicing results for the MDC.  See Harare 313. 
 
¶6. Post-Election Surge In Violence And Intimidation...  We have 
received reports from around the country of intimidation and 
violence against opposition supporters, civil society and white 
farmers in the past week.  For example, one ZANU-PF dissident 
reported that command centers run by off-duty soldiers had been 
established in rural areas to coordinate attacks, and that his own 
properties had been looted (see Harare 317); while a newly elected 
MP raised concerns that war veterans and ZANU-PF youth militia were 
reassembling in his province, causing fear amongst his constituents. 
 In addition to threats and beatings targeting election observers 
and party agents, as many as 45 white-owned farms were seized in the 
days following the election, again by war veterans and ZANU-PF youth 
militia (see Harare 314).  These reports track with MDC Secretary 
General Tendai Biti's public reports of the "militarization" of the 
countryside by ZANU-PF; Biti claims that security forces have been 
systematically deployed by the Mugabe regime to force a ZANU-PF win 
in the event of a runoff (see Harare 313).

Economic and Business News 
-------------------------- 
¶7. *Zimbabwe Dollar Dives... After having maintained its value for 
the past three weeks, the local currency swooned on the parallel 
market these last days, losing half its value on the street in one 
week.  We hear from bankers that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, a 
major parallel market player, has returned to the forex market, 
apparently with a bursting wallet. 
 
¶8. Punitive New Income Tax Bands, Higher Rates, And Steep Increase 
In Social Security Deduction...  The GOZ announced last week 
punitive new income tax bands and an increase in the tax rate for 
the highest bracket, i.e. for those earning over Z$5 billion/month 
(that's about US$77/month), effective April 1.  On top of those 
deductions come a 3% AIDS Levy, pension deductions that range from 
5-8%, and a huge increase in the National Social Security Authority 
(NSSA) deduction that works out to Z$150 million/month for employees 
and employers alike on wages and salaries of Z$5 billion/month. 
 
¶9. Wheat/Barley Farmers Still Awaiting Payment For 2007 Crop...  The 
Commercial Farmers' Union (CFU) reported last week that the vast 
majority of growers were still waiting for the hard currency portion 
of their payment for last year's winter wheat and barley crops.  The 
CFU suggested that the delays in payment would discourage farmers 
from growing wheat, which is primarily grown by commercial farmers, 
this approaching season. 
 
¶10. Delta Beverages Warns Of Unviable Prices... The Herald reported 
today that Delta Beverages could stop producing carbonated soft 
drinks and cut off the production line if prices are not reviewed to 
economic levels.  The state-owned newspaper quoted an approved 
selling price of less than Z$10 million while apparently it costs 
Delta Z$22 million to get the product (content only) off the 
production line. 
 
¶11. Corrigendum...  In last week's Zim Notes, an error crept into 
our calculation of the value of the just-released Z$50 million note 
- it was worth US$1.16 at issuance, not 58 US cents.  However, a 
 
HARARE 00000323  003 OF 003 
 
 
week later, its value on the street has already tumbled to about 75 
US cents.
