(SBU) Responding to reftel demarche, MFA Cabinet Advisor for 
African Affairs Ahmed Abu Zeid told us on May 27 that Egypt 
was unlikely to consider temporarily moving some of its 
engineers from UNMIS to UNAMID to speed absorption of 
additional troops into UNAMID.  Abu Zeid said that because of 
"technical" differences in the composition of Egypt's UNMIS 
and UNAMID engineering units, Egypt's UNMIS component would 
suffer and its UNAMID component would not substantially 
benefit from such a transfer.  We will follow up with the MOD 
to get more specifics on the technical difficulties that such 
a redeployment would entail.
