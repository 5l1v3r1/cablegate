Approximately 500 human rights activists from 100 countries

called the "Democratic Front."  Thirty-eight Kurdish/Arab

Democratic Front will hold its first congress on October 14.

visited the scene of the explosion and said that the 
investigation was continuing. Security measures around the

¶6.      ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: Twenty-five Human Shield Initiative 
(HSI) members from Istanbul set off for the Cirav Mountain in 
Siirt, along with 14 Siirt HSI members. HSI aims to bring the

spokesman, Yakup Kadri Karaboga, said the group's demands were 
clear: a bilateral truce, a general political amnesty, removal 
of impediments to freedom of expression, compensation of war 
victims, returns to evacuated villages, an end to military 
operations and an end to solitary confinement for Abdullah 
Ocalan. 
 
¶7.      ULKEDE OZGUR GUNDEM: Soldiers evacuated Kocanis village, 
previously the only village in the Bercalan Pasture of Hakkari 
province that had not been evacuated. GOT forces dropped 
chemical material from helicopters and evacuated many villagers 
on September 22 on the grounds that Heze Paratstina Gel (HPG - 
Public Protection Forces) members had found shelter there.  Many 
soldiers and village guards were dispatched to the region for 
the ongoing operation. 
 
¶8.      CUMHURIYET/TURKIYE/MILLIYET: A mine planted by 
PKK/Kongra-Gel militants on the road between Bukardi and Aricak,

on September 9. 
 
¶10.     CUMHURIYET: Residents of the Karaduvar quarter of Mersin 
filed petitions asking the Mersin Municipality to close down the 
installations for operating without a license (including TUTA, 
OPET, ATAS, Petrol Ofisi, GS Petroleum, and Shell Gaz 
companies), and for "being detrimental to environment and 
society." The residents are getting ready to press charges 
against those companies at the European Human Rights Court for 
"violating the right to life."
