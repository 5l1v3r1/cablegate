(SBU)  On October 29 Econoff met with First Secretary Sang 
Soo Lee in MOFAT's Disarmament and Nonproliferation Division 
to deliver demarche on U.S. designation of the Export 
Development Bank of Iran (EDBI) and three of its affiliates 
under E.O. 13382 (reftel).  Lee responded that he would 
notify relevant authorities in the Ministry of Strategy and 
Finance and the Ministry of Knowledge Economy and advise 
Econoff if any action was taken with respect to the 
designations. (In a separate meeting on November 4, Lee 
commented that he was still waiting for the response; Post 
will follow up.)
