REF: JAKARTA 02712 (NOAA ASST ADMINISTRATOR SPINRAD'S VISIT TO INDONESIA 
 
¶1. During his September 25 meeting with Surabaya Principal 
Officer, North Sulawesi Governor S. H. Sarundajang requested 
support for Manado's efforts to host a World Ocean Conference 
May 11-15, 2009.  Governor Sarundajang explained that by hosting 
the World Ocean Conference, North Sulawesi will call attention 
to the impact of global climate change on the oceans, noting 
that 26 Indonesian islands have disappeared as a result of 
rising seas levels.  The Governor added that he took advantage 
of participation in international conferences on environmental 
issues to raise concerns about the impact on ocean ecosystems, 
but too often these events focused only on the impact of climate 
change on forests and land ecosystems. 
 
¶2. The glossy color brochure describes a "high-level conference 
of heads of the states that have coastal and marine territories; 
eminent people; scientists; NGOs, journalists; private sector 
and stakeholders discussing global ocean issues."  The brochure 
adds that the 2009 World Ocean Conference will "provide a 
platform where world leaders and decision makers will come 
together to make commitment for sustainable development of 
marine resources."  In support of his plans, Governor 
Sarundajang has established a World Ocean Conference 2009 
Secretariat (www.woc2009-manado.net) and has begun soliciting 
 
SIPDIS 
international support.  The Governor told PO that President 
Yudhoyono, UNEP, UN Habitat, UNESCO, Global Forum on Oceans, 
Coasts and Islands, the governments of the U.S., France, 
Australia, and Germany, NOAA, NSF, and other international 
organizations had already offered their support for North 
Sulawesi's plans to host the World Ocean Conference in 2009. 
 
¶3.  The Governor hopes to leverage Manado's role as host of the 
2009 World Ocean Conference into international publicity for 
North Sulawesi.  The Governor noted that North Sulawesi's 
primary economic potential comes for tourism, agriculture, 
fisheries, and marine industries, however the world is not yet 
aware of North Sulawesi's potential.  The conference, he said, 
would be "a stepping stone for North Sulawesi to be known to the 
world."  Organizers expect approximately 4,000 people would 
attend the conference.  The brochure adds that one of the 
conference's expected outcomes would be the establishment of a 
"center of international marine research and development in 
Indonesia." 
 
¶4. The Governor said he expected Manado's role as the host of 
the 2009 World Ocean Conference would be finalized during the 
December UN Climate Change Conference (COP-13) in Bali.  He 
urged that the USG formally reiterate its support for the 
conference during the meetings in Bali. As reported reftel, the 
Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DKP) Numberi told 
visiting NOAA Assistant Administrator Dr. Spinrad September 18 
that there would be a side event at COP-13 on the World Ocean 
Conference.
