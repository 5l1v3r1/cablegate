¶1.  DCM, APAO, Econoff, and Poloff met with British, French, 
and German counterparts January 3 to discuss U.S.-EU Middle 
East reform efforts, per reftels.  (NOTE:  The EU does not 
have a mission in Bahrain.  END NOTE).  All parties presented 
their current initiatives and projects.  We described our 
programs under the four MEPI pillars and our joint efforts 
with the Bahrainis in the BMENA initiative.  The EU countries 
do not have a coordinated effort in Bahrain at this time. 
Possible areas for future cooperation include judicial and 
educational reform.  The group agreed to meet quarterly and 
will coordinate efforts when appropriate.
