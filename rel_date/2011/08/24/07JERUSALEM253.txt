¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  THE CONSUL GENERAL VISITED AUGUSTA 
VICTORIA HOSPITAL (AVH) IN EAST JERUSALEM JANUARY 31 TO 
COMMEMORATE THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MIDDLE EAST CANCER 
CONSORTIUM (MECC).  AVH IS THE ONLY PALESTINIAN HEALTH CARE 
FACILITY THAT IS EQUIPPED WITH A RADIOTHERAPY MACHINE, AND 
MECC IS FUNDING TRAINING FOR SEVERAL OF ITS ONCOLOGY AND 
RADIOTHERAPY SPECIALISTS.  THE AVH DIRECTOR CONFIRMED THAT 
THE GOI PAID USD 7.5 MILLION IN PA CLEARANCE REVENUE TO AVH 
IN JANUARY FOR PA PAYMENT ARREARS TO THE HOSPITAL.  THE 
CONSUL GENERAL'S VISIT AND REMARKS RECEIVED EXTENSIVE 
COVERAGE IN THE LOCAL PRESS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) THE CONSUL GENERAL SPOKE TO AN AUDIENCE OF HEALTH 
CARE SPECIALISTS AND MEMBERS OF THE PRESS GATHERED AT EAST 
JERUSALEM'S AVH IN COMMEMORATION OF MECC'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY. 
(BACKGROUND:  UNDER THE AEGIS OF THE USG, MECC WAS 
ESTABLISHED IN 1996 THROUGH AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 
MINISTRIES OF HEALTH OF THE PA, ISRAEL, JORDAN, EGYPT AND 
CYPRUS, WITH TURKEY JOINING IN 2004.  THE NATIONAL CANCER 
INSTITUTE (NCI) HAS SUPPORTED MECC WITH USD 350,000 ANNUALLY. 
 WITH MECC'S ASSISTANCE, MEMBER COUNTRIES MAINTAIN DATABASES 
THAT TRACK ALL REPORTED EPISODES OF CANCER IN EACH MEMBER 
COUNTRY.  MECC ALSO FUNDS TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR HEALTH CARE 
PROVIDERS IN CANCER TREATMENT AND PREVENTION AND PALLIATIVE 
CARE.  END BACKGROUND.)  THE CONSUL GENERAL REITERATED US 
SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND 
FACILITIES, AND ENCOURAGED AVH TO SHARE ITS EXPERTISE WITH 
OTHER PALESTINIAN HOSPITALS. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) AVH HAS THE ONLY RADIOTHERAPY MACHINE CURRENTLY 
OPERATIONAL FOR PALESTINIAN CANCER PATIENTS AT A 
PALESTINIAN-OPERATED FACILITY.  MECC FUNDED THE TRAINING OF 
FIVE MEMBERS OF AVH'S ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY UNITS. 
(NOTE:  THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT DONATED IN 2003 THE AVH MACHINE 
AND AN IDENTICAL MACHINE FOR DAR AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL IN GAZA 
CITY.  DAR AL-SHIFA DOES NOT HAVE A TRAINED PHYSICIST AND 
HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO OPERATE THE MACHINE, SO IT 
REMAINS IN ITS PACKAGING.  END NOTE.)  AVH DIRECTOR TAWFIQ 
NASSER EXPRESSED THE HOSPITAL'S GRATITUDE FOR MECC ASSISTANCE 
AND FOR USG ASSISTANCE TO THE DIALYSIS UNIT.  (NOTE:  USAID 
PROVIDED THE HOSPITAL WITH USD 136,500 IN DIALYSIS SUPPLIES 
AND MEDICINE DURING 2006.  END NOTE.)  NASSER STATED THAT 
AVH'S RADIOTHERAPY UNIT RUNS ONLY ONE EIGHT-HOUR SHIFT USING 
THE MACHINE, AS MORE SHIFTS ARE NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO A LACK OF 
PALESTINIAN RADIOTHERAPY SPECIALISTS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT AVH 
IS IN NEED OF AN ADDITIONAL RADIOTHERAPY MACHINE, AS A 
BREAKDOWN OF THE CURRENT MACHINE FULLY HALTS RADIATION 
TREATMENTS. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) NASSER CONFIRMED TO THE CONSUL GENERAL THE JANUARY 
RECEIPT FROM THE GOI OF USD 7.5 MILLION IN PA CLEARANCE 
REVENUE FOR PARTIAL PAYMENT OF PA ARREARS TO AVH.  HE SAID 
THE HOSPITAL HAD BEEN OPERATING AT A DEFICIT OF USD 2.7 
MILLION WHICH THE LUTHERAN WORLD FEDERATION HAS COVERED IN 
ORDER TO CONTINUE SERVING PATIENTS (SEE REFTEL). 
 
¶5.  (SBU) THE CONSUL GENERAL'S VISIT AND SPEECH AT AVH 
RECEIVED THOROUGH COVERAGE IN ARABIC LANGUAGE NEWS DAILIES 
AL-QUDS, AL-AYYAM, AND AL-HAYAT AL-JADIDA.  ALL REPORTS 
QUOTED HIS REMARKS PRAISING THE WORK OF THE HOSPITAL AND 
NOTING USG INTENTIONS TO CONTINUE PROVIDING SUPPORT TO 
PALESTINIAN HEALTH CARE.
