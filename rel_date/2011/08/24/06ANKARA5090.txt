In Today's Papers 
 
PM Erdogan on Turkish Participation in Peacekeeping Forces 
All papers covered PM Erdogan's half-hour address to the nation 
yesterday.  PM Erdogan talked about the situation in the Middle East 
and said "the only way to protect Turkey's national interests is to 
get involved in the developments in the Middle East."  PM Erdogan, 
in his speech, defended the government's decision to send troops to 
Lebanon.  Milliyet quotes the PM as saying that "an attitude of 'I 
do not care' will be treason towards our history, future and supreme 
interests of our nation."  Yeni Safak reports that the PM noted that 
the government has decided to send troops to Lebanon since all of 
the three conditions it had set have been met: 1) Turkey demanded a 
UN resolution; 2) Turkey asked for a ceasefire to be declared; and 
3) Turkey wanted all parties involved to welcome Turkey's 
contribution.  PM Erdogan underlined that the UN peace force does 
not have the duty of disarming Hezbollah. 
 
Commentaries on the Lebanon Peacekeeping Force and Turkey's Role 
Writing in the leftist Birgun, Hrant Dink is squarely against 
participation: "It looks like sending Turkish soldiers to a place 
which is very vulnerable to provocations will be a historic mistake. 
 When the Turkish parliament makes its decision on Lebanon on 
September 5, let's hope it will be the same as the decision 
regarding sending troops to Iraq." 
 
Hasan Aksay argued in the fundamentalist Vakit that there is "no 
need to even discuss the topic" as "you simply cannot have a 
discussion about the obvious":  "Here the obvious thing is the fact 
that sending troops to Lebanon is being part of Israeli violence and 
being part of the Greater Middle East project. The peacekeeping 
force cannot be a solution to the problem because in this case the 
solution is coming from the aggressor." 
 
Also weighing in against sending troops, Derya Sazak observes in the 
mainstream Milliyet that the Turkish government insistence that 
"Lebanon is different from the Iraq" and that "Hezbollah will not 
harm Turkish soldiers just because of they are Muslim" is "nothing 
but a cheap distortion." Sazak concludes: "The Turkish parliament 
should reject the deployment of troops to Lebanon.  Currently a 
bloody game is being staged in the Middle East and what we are 
seeing now is only the action in south Lebanon.  When the next act 
is staged we might end up finding ourselves a part of a big war 
against Syria and Iran." 
 
Writing in the Islamist-opinion maker Yeni Safak, Fehmi Koru says 
that Turkey should evaluate the purpose of the force: "The question 
we should ask is what kind of project are we about to become a part 
of.  In the Lebanon situation, the current peacekeeping project is 
designed to provide Israel's security.  Turkey should be a part of 
efforts to establish a balance of power in the Middle East where the 
existence of both the states of Israel and Palestine are recognized. 
 The current peace effort is only about bringing peace through war 
and use of force."
