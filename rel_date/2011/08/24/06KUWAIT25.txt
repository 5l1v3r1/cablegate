-- Eid Al-Dihaiwis wrote in the moderate daily Al-Qabas 
under the title "Secular America incites nations": "It turns 
out that most of the Muslim youths who go to Iraq for the 
purpose of carrying out Jihad have no relation to Al-Qaeda; 
rather, it is the result of the American occupation of Iraq. 
That means that hostility towards the United States of 
America has dramatically increased after the invasion of 
Iraq. The American media campaign to win the war and market 
the occupation.  Arab anger began to boil and Islamic Jihad 
began to move as the United States of America sank deeper 
into the Iraqi swamp, until it became the state of torture, 
political lies, and injustice.  The Iraqis have proven 
themselves with no help from the outside, if they are helped 
then Iraq will become the ground on which the United States 
of America loses its ideological, political, and military 
reputations.  The problem with America is that it is 
arrogant and underestimates the power of others. Also, its 
problem is that it does not know God's rules for the 
universe. If it did, it would not have been so sure of its 
power and its political, media, or military planning."
