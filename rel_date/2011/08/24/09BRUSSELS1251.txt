REF: STATE 095980 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)  Mission delivered reftel demarche regarding the 
September 22 Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) Meeting to the 
Palestine Desk Officer at the European Commission (EC).  She 
indicated that the EU understood that the level of attendance 
for the meeting had already been set at the senior level and 
that Deputy Director General for External Relations Hugues 
Mingarelli would represent the European Commission.  The 
officer noted that External Relations Commissioner Benita 
Ferrero-Walder would normally attend the AHLC, but has a 
schedule conflict.  According to the desk officer, 
Mingarelli's focus would be to:  (1) express support for 
Prime Minister Fayyad's government program and emphasize that 
EC support is already in line with the goals of the program; 
(2) publicize EC assistance (the EU is the largest donor of 
assistance to the Palestinians) with particular regard to 
institution building and to emphasize the importance of 
creating the right conditions for Palestinian economic 
growth; and (3) emphasize the issue of access to Gaza.
