REF: SECSTATE 106423 
 
We delivered reftel demarche to Rakovski Lashev, Head of the 
Human Rights Unit at the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs on October 14.  Lashev said the Bulgarian government 
shares our belief that the Goldstone report should be dealt 
with in the Human Rights Council and he would immediately 
pass along our request to his superiors and to the Bulgarian 
delegation in New York.  Lashev reaffirmed Bulgaria's full 
support of U.S. efforts in pressing for a comprehensive peace 
accord for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
