RESPONSE TO HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE OFFERS FOR HAITI 
 
REF: 10 STATE 4854; STATE 4208 
 
¶1.  The government of Cote d'Ivoire is encouraging its citizens to 
donate money to the people of Haiti through the Red Cross. 
Although a contact at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that 
final plans are not in place for government-to-government 
assistance, newspaper reports on January 20, 2010 indicated that 
President Laurent Gbagbo has decided to provide US$ 1 million to 
the government of Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake. 
Minister of Finance Charles Diby confirmed the donation to 
Ambassador and said the funds had been wired to the Ivorian Embassy 
in Washington with instructions that delivery was to be coordinated 
through the UN. 
 
¶2.  According to the Foreign Ministry 65 police and gendarmes from 
the Cote d'Ivoire are posted to Haiti with the UN.  One was 
slightly injured during the earthquake but all 65 remain on duty in 
Haiti.
