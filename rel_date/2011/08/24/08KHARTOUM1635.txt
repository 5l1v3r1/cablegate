Mr. President elect, my organization the SLM/A championing and 
defending the people of Darfur, who, atrocities against them 
declared by the US Government and Congress as genocide, is not only 
proud of you and of the people of the United States of America, but 
its also confident and hopeful that your administration would 
immediately embark to engage itself effectively in expediting the 
resolution of their tragedy and restoration of peace, security and 
stability in the larger Sudan. 
 
We look forward for further cooperation and understanding. 
Forward ever, backward never. Struggle continue
