REF:  STATE 54097 
 
¶1. (U) The GoA has confirmed its interest in participating in a 
follow-up conference in late summer to define a regional fiber optic 
network project as proposed reftel.  The Ministry of Communications 
has informed us that it will send a delegation of at least three 
persons - one from the ministry, one from the Afghanistan 
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, and one from Afghan 
Telecom. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Afghanistan is already committed to building its own 
national fiber ring with connections envisaged to its neighbors; 
providing a forum for coordinating this effort with other regional 
efforts would be useful to all parties.  As we approach the 
conference, we should factor into our preparations the fact that the 
GoA has not yet developed plans for ownership and operation of the 
system.  The system is being built at public expense by the Ministry 
of Communications, and we have seen early indications that the 
Chinese contractor, ZTE, is already falling behind on its ambitious 
schedule.  A similar slip in the cost estimates may throw the 
project open to re-bidding and reconsideration of the means of 
financing it.  The follow-on conference may be an opportunity to 
educate the GoA about best practices for developing, managing, and 
regulating this type of network at a particularly opportune time.
