¶1. (U)  This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Then Prime Minister Nader Al-Dahabi requested from the 
Ambassador, during a November 11 meeting, support for Jordan's 
interests during the next meeting of the United Nations Compensation 
Commission (UNCC).  Subsequent to that meeting, then Environment 
Minister Khaled Irani reviewed for EconCouns Government of Jordan 
(GOJ) views on the history of its interaction with the UNCC and 
requested U.S. intervention.  Irani was pleased to report that 
Jordan's most serious concern, dispersal of awarded funds, had 
recently been addressed.  He explained that of the $160 million 
awarded in 2005, until mid-November, Jordan had only received a 
little over $100 million.  Fifty-seven million was transferred in 
November, enabling Jordan to implement plans for restoring an 
ecosystem damaged during the first Gulf War.  Irani, however, 
requested U.S. support for prompt action at the next UNCC Governing 
Council meeting to approve a phased $23 million spending plan for 
local community projects, an action item that is reportedly already 
on the agenda. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Not on the agenda and of equal concern to Jordan is an 
alleged $12 million deduction for funds for environmental programs 
by the UNCC Secretariat for purported overpayments of individual 
claims.  Irani stated that the GOJ list of individual claims was 
provided by the UNCC and since the GOJ did not prepare the list, the 
government is therefore not responsible for, and should not be 
penalized for any mispayments.  He claimed that upon subsequent 
review, Jordan determined the UNCC list included deceased 
individuals, people who could not be located, and duplicate 
listings.  Jordan, he reported, through the Ministry of Labor simply 
made the payments it could.  Now that a problem has reportedly been 
identified, compensation has been taken from environmental funds. 
Irani argued that any overpayment problem should not be linked to 
environmental programs and requested an immediate investigation of 
the matter and restoration of the funds for environmental use. 
Irani added that although GOJ relations with the UNCC Secretariat 
are much improved now and UNCC processes less bureaucratic under the 
current Executive Secretary, the GOJ remains disappointed with the 
lack of response to its concerns about the $12 million deduction. 
 
¶4. (U) Action request:  Post would welcome any information that can 
be shared with the GOJ on the USG position at the next meeting of 
the Governing Council.  Post would also appreciate any information 
that can be shared with Jordan on the "missing" $12 million.  Post 
POCs are Economic Counselor Natalie Brown (BrownNE2@state.gov) and 
ESTH Officer Manu Bhalla (BhallaM@state.gov).
