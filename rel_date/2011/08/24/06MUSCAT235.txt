¶1. (SBU) In a February 18 call on MFA Chief of International 
Organizations Ambassador Talib bin Miran al-Raisi, P/E Chief 
took the opportunity to register USG objections to the UN 
Special Rapporteur's Report on detainee conditions in 
Guantanamo Bay (ref A), as well as to use talking points 
(refs B, C) emphasizing the USG's condemnation of all 
instances of abuse against detainees, as recently depicted in 
photos in the international and Omani press.  Ambassador 
al-Raisi was familiar with the UN Rapporteur's report and the 
fact that the UN team turned down USG requests to visit 
detention facilities in person before publishing its report. 
He was pleased to note the USG's denunciation of torture and 
mistreatment, taking note of the punishments meted out thus 
far to guilty parties. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Oman's print media gave prominent attention to the 
latest detainee abuse photos in February 16 and 17 editions. 
The government-owned Arabic language daily "Oman" was the 
only one of Oman's two Arabic and three English daily 
newspapers not to publish the story or photos on the front 
page on February 16, while February 17 editions of several 
newspapers gave front-page attention to the Iraqi 
government's reactions.  The February 16 headline in the 
privately owned Arabic daily "Al Watan" was "Freedom plus 
Democracy equals Sadism."  Outrage over the photos was also 
the leading topic in the local Internet message board 
"al-Sablah."  Labeled as "new photos of American freedom," 
the topic was viewed over 2,000 times and generated three 
dozen responses.  There have been no demonstrations, however, 
or other public manifestations of protest.  Reactions may 
have been muted somewhat by the fact that most media coverage 
took place over the local weekend.
