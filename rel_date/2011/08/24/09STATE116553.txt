TAGS: PREL UNGA IS
SUBJECT: GUIDANCE: 3RD COMMITTEE RESOLUTION ON 
"PALESTINIAN SELF-DETERMINATION" 
 
REF: MASILKO-GARUCKIS EMAIL OF 11/10/09 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action message. 
 
¶2. (U) Mission should call for a vote and vote "no" on Third 
Committee Agenda Item 68: "The right of the Palestinian 
people to self-determination." (REF)  Mission should draw of 
para 3 blocks in presenting an explanation of vote (EOV). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Begin EOV Blocks: 
 
-- With respect to the situation in the Middle East, the 
United States has clearly stated our policy that there should 
be two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in 
peace and security.  We back up our policy with substantial 
diplomatic support for both sides and significant financial 
support to the Palestinian Authority and to the Palestinian 
refugees receiving support from UNRWA, for which the United 
States is the largest single donor. 
 
-- We see no contradiction whatsoever between support for the 
Palestinian people and support for Israel.  We are deeply 
discouraged, therefore, to once again be presented with an 
unbalanced resolution that -- unlike the UNGA's action with 
respect to any other member state, geographic are or issue -- 
places demands on the Israeli side while failing to 
acknowledge that both sides have obligations and must take 
difficult steps toward peace. 
 
-- Resolutions such as this one presuppose the outcome of 
permanent status issues, such as the right of return and the 
status of Jerusalem, that properly belong in bilateral 
negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, making it 
that much more difficult to resolve them.  Resolutions such 
as this one also undermine the institutional credibility of 
the UN, which, through the Quartet, has an important role to 
play in supporting the resolution of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. 
 
-- For these reasons, the United States has voted "no" on 
this resolution today. 
 
End EOV blocks.
