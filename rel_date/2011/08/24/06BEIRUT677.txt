¶1.  On March 6, the Daily Star, a Lebanese English daily, 
reported that Syrian newspapers have claimed in recent 
editions that USD 3 billion in bank deposits were withdrawn 
from Lebanese banks by Syrian depositors in recent weeks due 
to political tensions between Syria and Lebanon.  On March 4, 
the Lebanese Arabic daily ad-Diyar reported that the Director 
General of the Syrian Commercial Bank, Doreid Dorgham stated 
that USD 10 billion of Syrian deposits have been withdrawn 
from neighboring countries, including Lebanon, in the year 
following the assassination of Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. 
 
 
RUMORS UNFOUNDED 
---------------- 
 
2,  Makram Sader, the Secretary General of the Association of 
Banks in Lebanon, told Econoff in a March 6 conversation, 
that the rumors of Syrian withdrawals are "unfounded" and he 
has seen only "normal movements" of bank deposits in recent 
months.  Saad Azhari, the Vice President of the Banks' 
Association and Deputy Chairman of BLOM Bank, told us on 
March 6, "the press information is incorrect" regarding the 
Syrian withdrawals.  BEMO General Manager Samih Saadeh told 
us that the reports are "inaccurate." 
 
TOTAL SYRIAN DEPOSITS IN LEBANON 
BETWEEN USD 1.5 - 3 BILLION 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Sader told Econoff that the Lebanese banking sector had 
USD 9.1 billion in non-resident deposits at the end of 
January 2006; this figure includes all includes deposits from 
non-resident Lebanese, the Arab business community, Syrians, 
and all other nationalities.  Lebanese bank secrecy laws do 
not allow reporting of bank deposits by nationality, but 
Sader said that he estimated that non-resident Syrians hold 
USD 1.5-2 billion of deposits.  Azhari estimated that Syrian 
non-residents held roughly USD 2.5 billion of banking 
deposits.  Saadeh estimated that Syrian deposits in Lebanon's 
banking sector totaled USD 2-3 billion, and Syrian deposits 
in Jordan's banking sector totaled roughly USD one billion. 
Saadeh also believes that USD 500-600 million of Syrian 
deposits held by key Syrian figures left the Lebanese banking 
sector for Syria and Jordan in the year following the Hariri 
assassination. 
 
NORMAL DEPOSIT GROWTH 
IN LEBANON IN RECENT MONTHS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Sader said that in the two months following the 
assassination of PM Hariri, USD 2.6 billion of deposits left 
the Lebanese banking sector, but deposit growth had increased 
7.6 percent (from USD 54.1 billion to USD 58.2 billion) 
between June 2005 and January 2006.  He speculated that 
Dorgham was likely confusing the amounts of Syrian deposits 
in Lebanon, Syrian deposits in OECD countries, and Syrian 
deposits in Lebanese banks in OECD countries; he said that 
total Syrian deposits in OECD nations and Lebanon may be 
close to USD 10 billion.  When Econoff asked Sader about the 
timing of the press reports, Sader said "the press always 
exaggerates reality" and maybe a story was created "to apply 
pressure."  Saadeh said false rumors of large Syrian 
withdrawals from Lebanese banks appeared in the news 
following the Hariri assassination and were "proven to be 
false" then.  Foreign banks have only been permitted entry 
into the Syrian market since 2003.  According to Sader, four 
Lebanese banks now operate in Syria--Audi Bank, BLOM Bank, 
Byblos Bank, and BEMO Bank.
