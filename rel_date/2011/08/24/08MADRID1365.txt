¶1. (U) Econoff spoke with Carmen Molina, Director of Human 
Resources at the UN's World Tourism Organization (WTO), on 
December 30 to request the reftel budgetary and personnel 
information.  As in prior years, Molina expressed regret that 
she was unable to provide the information requested since the 
US is not a member of the UNTWO.  Molina informed Econoff 
that such information was only available to members. 
 
¶2. (U) Separately, Econoff conducted an extensive internet 
search for the information requested.  While no such 
information is readily available on the web, Econoff was able 
to ascertain that the UNWTO headquarters in Madrid employs 
approximately 110 employees in addition to the employees that 
the organization may employ in its regional postings.
