U.S. Congressional Delegation and Bilateral Frictions 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2.  During the regular March 21 MFA press briefing, 
MFA Spokesperson Qin Gang noted that U.S. Senators 
Graham, Schumer and Coburn arrived in Beijing earlier 
in the day and will also visit Shanghai and Hong Kong 
before departing on March 26.  The Senators will meet 
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee 
Vice Chairman Sheng Huaren, State Councilor Wu Yi and 
leading officials from the MFA, NPC Foreign Affairs 
Committee, National Development and Reform Commission 
(NDRC), Ministry of Commerce and People's Bank of 
China (PBOC).  In a recently concluded meeting with 
the U.S. delegation, Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing 
stressed that U.S.-China cooperation serves the 
interests of both nations and the world at large.  In 
recent years bilateral ties have sustained positive 
momentum and achieved progress in a wide range of 
areas including nonproliferation, avian influenza, the 
Iranian nuclear issue and Afghanistan's 
reconstruction.  FM Li emphasized that Beijing and 
Washington should view bilateral relations from a 
strategic perspective and properly resolve disputes in 
order to promote overall constructive and cooperative 
relations in the 21st century.  FM Li also expressed

China's consistent position on Taiwan. 
 
¶2.  The U.S. Senators stated that the two countries 
should continue to promote close relations and resolve 
bilateral differences by adopting a "conciliatory 
attitude" and conducting negotiations in order to 
avoid creating a rift in the relationship, Qin 
continued.  They expressed the hope that China will 
continue to develop and "reunify" at some point in the 
future.  The Senators conveyed their views on the RMB 
revaluation and U.S.-China trade issues.  FM Li 
briefed them on Beijing's exchange rate policy and 
perspective on bilateral trade, highlighting that 
trade is mutually beneficial.  U.S.-China frictions 
should be resolved on the basis of equality and 
consultation and should not be politicized or 
exaggerated. 
 
U.S. Should Adopt "Fair" View of PRC Military Policy 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3.  Asked by the AP correspondent about Beijing's 
reported protests to Washington over the recently 
released U.S. National Security Strategy report and 
about PRC defense policy, Qin noted that he had issued 
an official statement on the matter on March 20 (ref). 
Maintaining China's sovereignty and territorial 
integrity is the irrefutable responsibility of the 
Chinese Government, he stressed.  China's defense 
expenditure aims to raise the standard of living of 
PLA servicemen within a "new context" and to 
counterbalance rising prices.  Questioned whether U.S. 
pressure on China would dampen the atmosphere for 
President Hu Jintao's April visit, Qin remarked that 
China wishes to step up dialogue and cooperation with 
the United States.  Beijing has addressed U.S. 
concerns pertaining to China's development path and 
economic and trade frictions on many occasions.  The 
two countries must consider each other's concerns and 
interests in handling bilateral ties.  The United 
States has raised the concept of China becoming a 
stakeholder, but this is a "two-way issue," Qin 
asserted.  Beijing hopes Washington will take an 
objective, fair and rational view of China's 
development and properly handle bilateral disputes. 
 
¶4.  Asked to comment on the recently concluded U.S.- 
Australia-Japan security dialogue, Qin called on the 
three countries to take more steps to build confidence 
and maintain peace and security in the region. 
Remarking that some people view the trilateral 
security meeting as targeted against China, Qin 
stressed that Beijing and Washington should develop 
constructive and cooperative relations, which is the 
consensus reached by the two countries' leaders.  Over 
the past few years, bilateral relations in general 
have developed smoothly, particularly in handling 
several international issues, and this "hard won" 
progress should be cherished.  The United States and 
China should implement the consensus reached by their 
leaders.  Washington should adopt an objective view 
toward China and avoid remarks that do not benefit 
bilateral cooperation or global peace and stability. 
 
President Putin's Visit 
----------------------- 
 
¶5.  During Russian President Putin's March 21-22 visit 
to China he will meet President Hu, Premier Wen Jiabao 
and NPC Standing Committee Chairman Wu Bangguo, Qin 
reported in response to a question on Putin's agenda 
and whether he will discuss joint oil pipeline 
construction.  The two nations will sign a number of 
bilateral agreements covering a wide range of fields. 
Russia has expressed its willingness to work with 
China on the pipeline construction, and Beijing is 
prepared to strengthen cooperation with Moscow on this 
issue.  Discussing the significance of the China- 
Russia strategic partnership, Qin noted that the two 
leaders issued a joint declaration on the 
international order to promote global peace and 
stability.  The two countries have completely resolved

their border dispute, established a parliamentary 
exchange mechanism, conducted joint military exercises 
and enhanced counterterrorism cooperation, 
particularly in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization 
(SCO) framework. 
 
China-Russia Consensus on Iranian Nuclear Issue 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶6.  Asked by the Kyodo News Agency correspondent 
whether the two Presidents will discuss the Iranian 
and North Korea nuclear issues and Russia's proposal 
on Iranian nuclear enrichment activities, Qin noted 
that the topics will be raised.  Both countries 
maintain a constructive attitude toward helping 
achieve a resolution and share the objective of 
resolving the issue in a peaceful manner.  China 
believes there is still potential to resolve the 
Iranian nuclear issue through negotiation, Qin 
highlighted.  All the parties should demonstrate 
flexibility in order to create conditions conducive to 
a proper settlement.  Reiterating that China and 
Russia share common views on the issue, Qin asserted 
that Russia's proposal is a helpful attempt to break 
the current impasse and achieve a final resolution. 
China supports all such efforts.  Asked by the AFP 
reporter to comment on the British and French draft 
circulating in the UNSC, Qin remarked that a 
diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue is 
in the interests of all the parties concerned, 
including UNSC members, and all the parties should 
step up negotiations.  He highlighted that the U.S. 
Ambassador to the UN has stated that all the parties 
should continue consultations, adding that this is not 
only the wish of China and Russia but of all the 
nations concerned. 
 
Iraq 
---- 
 
¶7.  Asked about the anniversary of the Iraq war, Qin 
remarked that countries should resolve disputes 
through negotiation.  The most pressing issue is to 
promote Iraq's reconstruction efforts and restore 
stability to Iraq. 
 
China "Dissatisfied" with UN Special Rapporteur Report 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶8.  Asked to comment on the recently issued report by 
UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Nowak on his November 
2005 visit to China, Qin expressed China's 
dissatisfaction and regret over the report.  He argued 
that Nowak's report did not represent a comprehensive 
and objective reflection of China's efforts to prevent 
torture.  While the paper made some positive comments 
on China's steps to eliminate the use of torture, it 
contained many problems, was based on incorrect and 
unverified information, exceeded the scope of Nowak's 
authority, indicated a misunderstanding of Chinese law 
and held unfair views toward Chinese law.  China has 
laws and a supervisory mechanism to prevent the use of 
torture, Qin asserted. 
 
Visit by UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶9.  Qin noted that the MFA invited UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees Guterres to visit China 
March 20-22.  He will meet State Councilor Tang 
Jiaxuan and officials from the MFA, Ministry of Public 
Security (MPS), Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of 
Civil Affairs to discuss refugee issues and China's 
cooperation with the UN High Commission for Refugees 
(UNHCR).  Beijing hopes the visit will help enhance 
mutual confidence and cooperation.  Earlier in the day 
High Commissioner Guterres held positive talks with FM 
Li, who expressed the hope that the UNHCR will 
cooperate with China on refugee treatment issues. 
Asked whether North Korean refugees in China will be 
discussed, Qin argued that they are illegal migrants 
and not refugees.  China will continue to follow PRC

and international laws and humanitarian principles in 
dealing with these people, he stated. 
 
NYT Reporter Zhao Yan 
--------------------- 
 
¶10.  Asked by the New York Times correspondent about 
the legal status of detained NYT reporter Zhao Yan, 
Qin declined to discuss the details of the case.  "We 
should trust China's judicial organs to handle the 
matter according to the law," he suggested. 
 
Ma Ying-jeou U.S. Trip 
---------------------- 
 
¶11.  Asked whether KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's visit 
to the United States constitutes a violation of the 
U.S. one-China policy, Qin replied that China does not 
challenge non-official exchanges between Taiwan and 
other parties.  Beijing, however, firmly opposes 
Taiwan actions aimed at splitting China. 
 
State Councilor Tang's Visit to Nepal 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  Qin reported that during State Councilor Tang 
Jiaxuan's March 16-18 visit to Nepal, he met King 
Gyanendra, FM Pandey, Vice Chairmen of the Council of 
Ministers and Chairmen of the Nepali Congress and 
Communist Parties.  Tang highlighted that China will 
not alter its policy of friendship toward Nepal, 
regardless of changes in the international situation. 
He said that Beijing will not interfere in other 
countries' internal affairs and Nepal should select 
its own path of development.  China will continue to 
back Nepal's efforts to maintain its stability and 
territorial integrity.  Nepali leaders thanked China 
for its consistent support, according to Qin. 
 
CPPCC Chairman Jia in Vietnam 
----------------------------- 
 
¶13.  During a March 20-24 visit to Vietnam, Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) 
Chairman Jia Qinglin met with Vietnamese Communist 
Party Central Committee Executive Secretary Phan Dien, 
Qin noted.  The commented on the positive development 
of inter-party relations, economic and trade 
relations, the gradual resolution of border disputes 
and the implementation of the Gulf of Tonkin Treaty. 
Chairman Jia made a two-point proposal to further 
enhance bilateral exchanges and deepen cooperation in 
these areas. 
 
MFA Information Department Personnel Change 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶14.  Qin confirmed that Director General of the MFA
