SUBJECT: FM MADURO TO PROVIDE UNASUR PROOF OF COLOMBIAN PLANS TO 
DESTABILIZE VENEZUELA 
 
¶1.        (U)  In a November 24 press release, Foreign Minister 
Nicolas Maduro announced that Venezuela would provide proof of 
Colombian  "paramilitary incursions and intent to destabilize" 
Venezuela at the November 27 UNASUR meeting in Quito, Ecuador.  He 
said the November 19 capture of Magaly Judith Moreno Vega in the 
Venezuelan city of Maracaibo was evidence that Colombia was 
"sending its paramilitary leaders" to Venezuela. 
 
 
 
¶2.       (U) Maduro called on the UNASUR foreign ministers to also 
examine ways to eliminate Colombian drug production and 
trafficking, noting that the United States was the largest drug 
market in the world.  Referring to the recent Venezuelan 
destruction of foot bridges, Maduro advised President of Colombia 
Alvara Uribe against overreacting to the "sovereign decision of 
Venezuelan military authorities to dynamite two illegal foot 
bridges used by groups associated with narco-traffickers."  He said 
Venezuela wanted to warn UNASUR of "the danger represented by the 
Colombian government which cynically uses elegant phrases and false 
calls for dialogue to conceal a guerilla process against our 
country and against Latin America."
