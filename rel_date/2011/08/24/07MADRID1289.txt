EconOff passed reftel points July 2 to Juan Luis Munoz de 
Laborde, MFA's Deputy Director of Multilateral Economic 
Relations.  Munoz de Laborde indicated that Spain would 
probably not oppose the proposal and also said that the 
Partnership for Democratic Governance (PDG) was a worthy 
initiative, although he questioned the placement of the PDG 
within the auspices of the OECD.  Spain is still developing 
its final position on the PDG proposal.
