REF: STATE 69315 
 
¶1. (SBU) Global Affairs officer passed reftel follow-up 
information May 23 to Joerg Polster, German MFA International 
Energy and Nuclear Energy Policy desk officer.  Polster, who 
had attended the NSG Plenary and related meetings in Cape 
Town, South Africa, from April 16-20, was familiar with the 
U.S. proposal for the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to share 
export denial information concerning Iran with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UNSC Iran 
Sanctions Committee, and the non-NSG Participating 
Governments (PGs).  Polster said the German Government had 
not yet decided on a response to the USG proposal, but had 
some reservations about sharing such information with the 
proposed recipients.  Polster said he will pass the U.S. 
follow-up message on its proposal to the appropriate members 
of the German Government for discussion. 
 
¶2. (U) Post will report any substantive German response 
septel.
