REF: STATE 48252 
 
(U) In response to reftel request for a status update on the 
Blue Lantern end-use check on DDTC license 946549 involving 
the Spanish firm Paramount Aircraft Services, we are 
currently working with the Spanish Ministry of Defense (MOD) 
to receive verification of Paramount's bono fides and its 
transaction to supply spare parts for P-3 aircraft.  We will 
provide information to help PM/DTTC determine whether an 
export license should be approved in this case as soon as we 
receive an official response from the MOD.
