SUBJECT: MOZAMBICAN MEDIA FAULTS WEAK CIVIL SOCIETY FOR LACK OF 
COMMENT ON ZIMBABWE 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY: The Charge hosted a lunch on July 17 for six top 
independent media editors, at which discussion of Zimbabwe 
dominated.  The editors expressed disappointment with the Government 
of Mozambique's (GRM) silence on the issue, in part a symptom of 
weak civil society organizations in the country.  The Charge 
reiterated to the editors his statement to the GRM that Zimbabwe's 
neighbors have a responsibility to speak out, and that keeping quiet 
is damaging Mozambique's international reputation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  During the Charge's lunch with six top independent media 
editors in Mozambique on July 17, conversation on Zimbabwe 
dominated.  The editors, representing six different private media 
outlets in Mozambique - TV, Radio and Print - expressed frustration 
with the situation in Zimbabwe and the lack of response from their 
government.  While the party of the President, FRELIMO, issued an 
official letter of congratulations to Mugabe and ZANU-PF after the 
June elections (not released to the media as per custom but 
discovered by journalists and then widely covered here), President 
Guebuza himself has not made such a public proclamation.  Still, 
most editors attribute Guebuza's presence at the recent African 
Union summit and his continued relations with the ZANU-PF Ambassador 
here as a clear sign that FRELIMO support translates into GRM 
support. 
 
¶3.  (U)   The Charge reiterated his message to the GRM with the 
editors present:  Neighboring African states have a responsibility 
to speak out on the crisis in Zimbabwe, and as of now, Mozambique is 
"on the wrong side [of history]."  The Charge told editors that 
Mozambique's international reputation, with the United States and 
others, is slipping each day the silence continues. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The editors responded that the independent media has been 
vocal and continues to speak out against Mugabe's rule but that 
civil society remains largely silent for a number of reasons:  Its 
own weak nature, due to a lack of civic education in schools; a 
dearth of institutions that represent civil society in Mozambique; 
and the largely-held fear of being reprimanded or punished by the 
GRM. One editor noted that if the GRM spoke out against Mugabe, then 
civil society would follow suit - but until then will remain quiet. 
One media representative stated that the cancellation of a 
recently-planned public demonstration against violence in Zimbabwe 
exemplified Mozambican civil society's weakness. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The group of editors unanimously expressed great 
pessimism over Zimbabwe and its effects on Mozambique.  They agreed 
that the situation in Zimbabwe will worsen and that Mozambique, in 
particular its central region that borders Zimbabwe, will pay a 
severe price. 
 
¶6.  (U)  As Mozambique prepares for its own elections - municipal on 
November 19 and presidential in 2009 - Zimbabwe will be an issue on 
Mozambicans' minds, if not from their mouths.  The editor of the 
weekly newspaper Zambeze (distribution 20,000; readership 100,000) 
titled his July 17 editorial "The Mugab-ization of Mozambique" 
writing that today's climate in Mozambique is not much different 
than the climate here just before its civil war. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Post will remain engaged with the independent media here, 
as they represent the strongest voice in Mozambique speaking out on 
Zimbabwe.
