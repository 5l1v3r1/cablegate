Reporting Period 
 
1)           Oct 6- EXBS Advisor met with MFA Energy, Water 
and Environment Issues Head of Department Gulsum Erkul to 
discuss areas of mutual cooperation between the United States 
and the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority; areas included 
discussions on nuclear forensic testing, participation in the 
"Sister Laboratory" program and other non-proliferation 
projects.  Erkul informed EXBS Advisor that the GOT was in 
favor of TAEK involvement in projects that increased 
international cooperation.  EXBS Advisor stressed that we 
consider Turkey an important partner in this cooperation and 
also recognize that TAEK is considered a leader in Atomic 
Energy programs in the region. 
 
2)           Oct 11 - EXBS Advisor met with Customs 
Enforcement Deputy Director General Mehmet Guzel to discuss 
recent Turkish Customs activities.  EXBS Advisor provided 
Guzel with additional information for upcoming orientation 
visit by senior Turkish Customs officials to the U.S. and 
provided information concerning the requested spare parts for 
the Turkish Portal Monitors.  EXBS Advisor informed Guzel 
that DOE personnel recommend limited changes to the installed 
equipment which will increase reliability and sensitivity of 
the monitors.  These changes can all be accomplished within 
the framework of the initial installation agreement and will 
better prepare the monitor for the full upgrade to the newest 
in SLD equipment once the NP Cooperation Agreement is 
ratified. Finally, Guzel provided information on recent Black 
Sea Customs officials meeting in Kiev and other Turkish 
Customs activities. 
 
3)          Oct 12- EXBS Advisor met with Acting MFA Arms 
Control and Disarmament Head of Department Serhan Yigit to 
conduct monthly update meeting on all current projects in 
progress in Turkey, including Internal Control Program (ICP), 
Commodity Identification Training (CIT), Product 
Identification Tool (PIT) and Second Line of Defense (SLD). 
EXBS advisor reviewed the successful progress that was 
completed by UFT with the ICP project; however he raised 
concerns that the PIT project remains stagnant and is in 
jeopardy of being canceled due to lack of progress.  Yigit 
stated he would look into the issue and try to overcome the 
delays.  EXBS Advisor also discussed the status of the NP 
Cooperation Agreement, which is awaiting final ratification 
by Grand National Assembly. 
 
4)           Oct 17-  EXBS Advisor met with Customs 
Enforcement Deputy Director General Mehmet Guzel to discuss 
alternative solution to the lack of spare parts that Turkish 
Customs is beginning to experience for currently installed 
portal monitors.  EXBS Advisor provided Guzel with ideas from 
DOE SLD personnel which will provide some modernization of 
the equipment while waiting for final ratification of the NP 
Cooperation Agreement and the start of a complete 
modernization of all SLD equipment.  EXBS Advisor proposed a 
visit of DOE technical experts to meet with Customs experts 
in early November.  Guzel agreed this would be a good idea 
and should be coordinated.  Also, EXBS Advisor provided 
update to Guzel on the planning and coordination of the visit

Commodity Identification Training (CIT), Product 
Identification Tool (PIT) and Second Line of Defense (SLD). 
EXBS Advisor also discussed the status of the NP Cooperation 
Agreement, which is awaiting final ratification by Grand 
National Assembly.  EXBS Advisor reiterated previous
