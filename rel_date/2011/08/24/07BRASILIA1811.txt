SUBJECT: BRAZIL: RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR CONTRIBUTION TO 
LEBANON TRIBUNAL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 129919 
 
¶1. (U) Poloffs delivered Reftel demarche to Counselor 
Glivania de Oliveira, chief of the United Nations Division at 
the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Relations (Itamaraty). 
Oliveira was familiar with the Tribunal and agreed its 
establishment will represent a significant step forward for 
Lebanon.  She was noncommittal on whether Brazil would make a 
voluntary donation to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, 
noting that due to resource constraints, Itamaraty had 
limited flexibility to make additional voluntary donations. 
She noted, however, that Brazil had made voluntary 
contributions in the past to UN activities in Palestine and 
others related to the peace process, and said that the MRE 
would consider the issue carefully. 
 
¶2. (U) Oliveira took the opportunity to inform poloffs that 
the Government of Brazil had just authorized the payment of 
the remaining US$2 million in arrears owed to the UN, which 
would put Brazil,s payments on its assessed contributions in 
good standing for the first time in more than a decade. 
Oliveira made it a point to mention that clearing its debt is 
meant as a signal of how important the Government of Brazil 
views its responsibilities under the UN Charter.
