We delivered Secretary's letter ref A on UNESCO Cultural 
Diversity to Turkish MFA Directorate General for Overseas 
Promotion and Cultural Affairs on October 11.  We followed up 
with Directorate officials who informed us the letter had 
been passed to FM Gul, but we have not yet been able to 
elicit a Turkish response.  PolCouns will again demarche 
Ambassador Sule Soysal on October 19 to reinforce the USG
