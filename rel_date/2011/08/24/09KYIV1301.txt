REF: STATE 74362 
 
¶1. (SBU) On August 4, we followed up on our earlier delivery 
of reftel demarche encouraging enhanced contributions to the 
effort in Afghanistan.  Olga Timysh, Deputy Director for 
Afghanistan and Central Asia in MFA's Asia, Africa, Middle 
East Directorate, made it clear that Ukraine's economic 
crisis had eroded its ability to enhance its contribution. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On the military side, Ukraine currently has ten 
peacekeepers deployed in Afghanistan: seven with a Lithuanian 
PRT and two or three at ISAF headquarters.  These will 
remain.  The Ministry of Defense, MFA and the President's 
office would like to augment Ukraine's peacekeeper 
contribution.  However, Timysh underlined, there is no 
funding for augmentation at the present time.  On a policy 
level, however, Timyish said Ukraine endorses the overall 
approach we outlined in our demarche and appreciates the 
importance President Obama places on broad international 
support. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Foreign Ministry has plans to open an Embassy in 
Kabul, Timysh told us.  MFA has even picked out a building. 
However, a budget crisis at MFA (and throughout the GOU) has 
put all plans to open the Embassy on hold. Timysh noted that, 
at present, Ukraine maintains a only a one diplomat office in 
Kabul. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Timysh said that Ukrainian businessmen have the 
potential to contribute to Afghan reconstruction.  Because of 
the Soviet experience, there is a considerable number of 
Ukrainian businessmen who understand the environment and who 
could help with a range of infrastructure projects.  To move 
forward, they need security and funding.  The GOU can not 
fund projects; they must be commercial or funded by another 
donor.  However, the eventual opening of an Embassy would 
help spur more Ukrainian businessmen and technicians to take 
the risk and enter the Afghan market.  Some are holding back 
because of the lack of consular support. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Timysh's remarks indicate that, until 
Ukraine's economic contraction reverses, the GOU will not be 
in position to enhance meaningfully its contribution to the 
effort in Afghanistan.
