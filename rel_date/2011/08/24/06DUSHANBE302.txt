SUBJECT: TAJIK TRANSPORT MINISTER PLEASED WITH BRIDGE 
 
 
¶1.  On his first visit to the U.S.-funded bridge construction 
site at Nizhniy Pyanzh, Transportation Minister Ashurov 
expressed great satisfaction and offered to get involved 
personally if problems arise regarding the cement supply or 
customs.  During the February 13 visit with PolOff and a 
visiting Trade And Development Agency transportation mission, 
Ashurov reported that President Rahmonov asked him about the 
project two days earlier, and was waiting for a full briefing 
after Ashurov's trip. 
 
¶2.  Ashurov had requested the visit during a January 27 meeting 
with PolOff, noting he had not been to the site since the June 
2005 groundbreaking ceremony.  He expressed mild dissatisfaction 
that even he, the Minister of Transportation, needed special 
permission to get access to the site.  The Project Engineer told 
Ashurov that he and technical specialists from the Ministry 
would be welcome at any time, provided they make arrangements 
through the Embassy, assuaging Ashurov's concern. 
 
¶3.  Progress at the bridge was visible.  The Project Engineer 
noted that Tajik customs had held up some equipment for a 
period, and a change in the management of the state cement 
factory threatened to delay work.  Ashurov observed that there 
had been a trilateral agreement between the U.S., Afghan, and 
Tajik governments, and the contractor, and he would get 
personally involved with any further customs disputes to ensure 
the project stayed on track.  The Deputy Head of Khatlon 
province asked some pointed questions about safety conditions 
and wages for Tajik workers. 
 
¶4.  The seven-hour round trip car ride provided ample 
opportunity to discuss other transportation priorities.  Ashurov 
noted road rehabilitation for major transit corridors had 
attracted significant foreign attention, and many projects were 
in various stages of planning and financing.  The Japanese are 
rehabilitating 23 km of road from the bridge to Dusti, which 
then links to the main highway to Dushanbe.  A Chinese 
feasibility study of rebuilding the Sharshar pass by Nurek 
should lead to a grant for that project.  The Asian Development 
Bank has taken the lead on other significant road projects, 
including the strategically and commercially vital road from 
Dushanbe, through the Rasht Valley, to the Kyrgyz border. 
 
¶5.  Although Tajik roads take a beating from flooding, rains, 
and avalanches, the minister admitted there was not much 
planning for minor maintenance and repairs; local governments 
held that responsibility, but did not always allocate resources 
for roads.  However, budgets for maintenance have increased on 
the local and national level - last year the central government 
spent 40 million somoni (approx. $13 million) on road 
maintenance and repair. 
 
¶6.  Ashurov made a plug for developing a tram/streetcar system 
in Dushanbe to connect the city center to the fast-growing 
residential regions on the outskirts.  He suggested getting used 
streetcars from Europe or America to build the system.   Ashurov 
is a career employee of the Transportation Ministry - he 
referred to himself as an "automobilist" several times - and 
took a great technical interest in the bridge and other possible 
projects. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Ashurov, a career employee of the Ministry 
of Transport, got into the weeds on the technical aspects of the 
bridge and seemed pleased with what he saw and heard.  His 
personal interest may well smooth the way and help keep this 
strategic project on track.  He enjoys a reputation as an honest 
cabinet member, respected by the President, if not in the inner 
circle, and should prove to be a key partner in the Central 
Asian Infrastructure Integration Initiative.  END COMMENT.
