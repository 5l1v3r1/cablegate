Â¶1.  Editorial in San Pedro Sula-based liberal daily "La 
Prensa" of 5/23 entitled "At home."  "The members of 
battalion Xatruch returned home last Friday after spending 
almost five months in Iraq working to support the 
consolidation of peace and democracy in that country." 
 
"The performance of the Honduran troops was positive, and 
their experience has grown by being in contact with other 
cultures, by having to respond to emergency situations, and 
by serving in the cause of peace." 
 
"Will there be more Honduran soldiers in Iraq?  We'll get 
the answer after July 1 when the new Iraqi government will 
be installed in office.  Moreover, as many other countries 
have proposed, the U.N. may set up an international 
peacekeeping force which could include Honduran troops." 
 
"The work done by the Honduran soldiers in Iraq has been 
admirable.  It's gratifying that they have all returned 
prepared to continue to contribute to international peace."
