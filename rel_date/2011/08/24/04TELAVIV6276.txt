Palestinian militants affiliated with the Popular Resistance

-- Route Four (Salahadeen Road), the main north-south traffic 
artery, was open with a major detour at Netzarim Junction. 
-- Erez Crossing was open for internationals and diplomats 
and for a limited number of Palestinians.  According to 
UNRWA, 200 Palestinian laborers crossed on December 10. 
UNRWA reported that the IDF announced it would now allow 
national staff of UN organizations to cross at Erez in 
vehicles, rather than on foot, with prior coordination 
through COGAT, but has not yet implemented the new policy. 
 
-- The Erez Industrial Zone remained closed, except for 
factory owners, on December 10. 
 
-- Sufa Crossing was closed for Palestinian laborers December 
10, but was open for the import of aggregates used in 
construction. 
 
-- Karni Terminal was open, but reportedly operating slowly. 
 
-- Rafah Terminal was open for arrivals and departures 
December 10.  Although the IDF no longer prohibits the exit 
of male Palestinians age 16-35 from the Gaza Strip, lengthy 
checks at the border mean that few Palestinians in this 
category are actually able to exit.  There are no age 
restrictions for entry into Gaza. 
 
-- Tel al-Sultan checkpoint was closed December 10.  Toufah 
checkpoint was open for residents of al-Mowassi.
