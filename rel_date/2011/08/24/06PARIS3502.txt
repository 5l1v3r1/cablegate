delivered to Acting PolCouns May 23 a diplomatic note 
(informal translation para 2) and curriculum vitae with the 
following main points: 
 
- Monaco intends to establish an Embassy in Washington, D.C. 
to strengthen its relations with the United States; 
 
- In the interim, Monaco would propose to accredit its 
Ambassador to the UN, Gilles Noghes, to the U.S. 
 
- Monaco would be pleased if the U.S. would accredit its 
Ambassador to France, to Monaco as well. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Guidance request:  Please provide the text of a 
diplomatic note in response.  As refs B and C indicate, 
Monegasque officials are hoping that the U.S. will be the 
first non-resident country to accredit its Ambassador to 
Monaco.  In that context, we  understand that Monaco may be 
actively delaying requests by Russia, China and Switzerland.
