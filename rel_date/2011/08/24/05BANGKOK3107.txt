¶1.  (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to 
Minister-Counselor Amornsate Singha, the new Director of 
MFA's North America Division.  In  subsequent conversations, 
Amornsate said that the Royal Thai Government (RTG) has 
already delivered congratulatory messages to both President 
Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Ja'afari through 
diplomatic channels and is considering issuing a public 
statement of support as well.  Amornsate noted that the 
language the RTG had used in its diplomatic messages was 
almost identical to the language provided in our talking 
points.  Amornsate said that the RTG does not have any 
objection to issuing a public statement of support, but has 
not reached consensus on appropriate language within the 
Foreign Ministry. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Poloff asked if Foreign Minister Kanthati -- who 
departs May 10 for a May 13 meeting with the Secretary -- 
would be prepared to issue a statement during his visit to 
the U.S..  Amornsate said that a statement of support for the 
Iraq Transitional Government has been included in FM 
Kanthati's trip talking points and background material, but 
he could not confirm whether the Foreign Minister would make 
a public statement during the visit.
