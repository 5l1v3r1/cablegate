¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel A, same sex relationships are 
considered illegal under Sudanese Criminal Code, Article 148, 
as well as public order and Sharia laws in northern Sudan. 
Conviction under these statutes carries the same punishment 
as for adultery. Same-sex orientation citizens maintain a 
discrete, low-profile presence throughout Sudan.  Post is not 
aware of any recent charges or convictions of individuals, in 
either the north or south, based on their same-sex 
orientation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sudan is a religiously-conservative, predominantly 
Muslim country in which sexual orientation is not openly 
discussed. There are no gay rights movements in Sudan, nor 
are there any anti-gay organizations.  Post has no 
information of any discrimination, harassment or arrests for 
anyone engaging in same-sex relationships. There is no 
pending or recently-passed, anti same-sex legislation.  We 
are also unaware of any plans underway to introduce such 
legislation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Southern Sudan has a semi-autonomous government, and 
is not under Sharia law.  However, its citizens are also 
subject to Sudanese Criminal Code, Article 148.  As in the 
north, there are no pending legislative actions in the 
Government of Southern Sudan assembly to modify existing laws 
or introduce new ones regarding same-sex relationships.
