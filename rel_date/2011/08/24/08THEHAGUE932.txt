(SBU) The Dutch strongly support the EU effort to win 
approval of the Iran resolution but are disappointed with the 
U.S. decision to withdraw from the freedom of expression 
resolution.  Angele Samura, at the Dutch MFA human rights 
department, told poloff on November 5 that the Dutch have 
instructed several embassies to join the French in demarching 
capitals in support of the Iran resolution.   Samura agreed 
the vote on the Iran resolution would be tough, but welcomed 
Canada's decision to table the longer draft.  Samura added 
that the Dutch were disappointed by the U.S. decision to 
withdraw from the free expression resolution, given the 
controversy in the Netherlands over Islam and recent art 
exhibitions that have offended some Muslim audiences.
