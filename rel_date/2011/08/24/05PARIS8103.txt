SUBJECT: FRENCH PARTICIPATION IN THE DECEMBER 4-5 KABUL 
CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 211164 
 
(SBU) We shared and discussed reftel points separately with 
MFA's South Asia and Economic Directorates.  Initially, MFA 
Afghanistan Desk Officer told us that Anne Grillo-Nebout, the 
Deputy-Director (DAS-equivalent) for South Asia would be 
attending.  However, subsequently, the G-8 Office in the 
Economics Directorate explained to us that Ms. Grillo-Nebout 
would not attend and that France will be represented 
exclusively by their Ambassador, Regis Koetschet, resident in 
Kabul.  Neither directorate wanted to elaborate further on 
expectations the GOF may have for the conference.
