¶1.  Summary. (SBU) On December 8, Poloff met with Ngok Dinka 
traditional leaders in Abyei town, who stated that the National 
Congress Party (NCP) is arming militias in the area in order to 
destabilize Abyei and prevent demarcation of Abyei's boundaries. 
Traditional leaders also complained that the Abyei Administration's 
lack of funding and unwillingness to govern hinder development and 
peace initiatives in Abyei.  Civil society leaders told Poloff that 
they trust the Joint Integrated Police Unit (JIPU) in Abyei more 
than the Joint Integrated Unit (JIU).   Youth leaders added that the 
JIPU should be an all-Dinka force, as Abyei belongs to the Dinka. 
Abyei's progress toward peace and development continues to crawl, 
despite efforts by national and international organizations to 
improve the situation there.  End Summary.

NCP, Not Misseriya, Blocking Demarcation

¶2. (SBU) On December 8, Poloff met in Abyei town with Ngok Dinka 
traditional leaders who stated that the NCP, not the Misseriya, is 
behind efforts to hinder demarcation of the Abyei boundary.  These 
leaders stated that the NCP is arming Misseriya, Nuer, and even some 
NCP-affiliated Dinka militia forces in an effort to destabilize the 
area and block the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) ruling on 
Abyei (Ref A).  Traditional leaders noted that while the Misseriya 
typically begin to enter the Abyei area in mid-January, this year 
they came in early November, and came heavily armed.  (Note: A 
drought in the area is at least partially responsible for the 
Misseriya's early migration this year. End Note.)  They added that 
stability in the region will be impossible without demarcation of 
the Abyei boundary.

Administration Hindering Peace and Progress 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) In a December 8 meeting with Poloff, traditional leaders 
complained that the Abyei Administration has no capacity or will to 
govern.  Traditional leaders noted that Arop Moyak Monytoc, Abyei's 
Chief Administrator, and most of its legislators, are rarely in 
Abyei, and do nothing while there.  (Note: Mark Rutgers, UNMIS Head 
of Office for Abyei, confirmed on December 7 that Monytoc is rarely 
in Abyei.  End Note.)  Traditional leaders also noted that funds 
budgeted to Abyei have not been released, leaving Abyei bereft of 
basic services and infrastructure.  They stated that plans for a 
traditional migration conference between Ngok Dinka and Misseriya 
tribal leaders that they submitted to Monytoc last year remain 
unaddressed. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Despite the recognized ineffectiveness of the Abyei 
Administration, Ngok Dinka traditional leaders were adamant that a 
migration conference with Misseriyia leaders cannot take place 
without government involvement.  They stated that without government 
oversight, enforcement of any agreement reached will be impossible. 
They added that they could not meet alone with the Misseriya because 
the Misseriya might kill them.

Distrust of Abyei JIU 
--------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) In a December 8 meeting, leaders from the local women's 
union and youth union told Poloff that they do not trust the Abyei 
JIU to provide security, and want security in the town provided by 
the JIPU.  Women's leaders noted that the JIU fought amongst itself 
in the May, 2008 Abyei conflict (Ref B).  Youth leaders stated that 
they want the JIPU to be solely Ngok Dinka, adding that "Abyei 
belongs to the Dinka" and "everything in Abyei must be Dinka." 
Youth leaders also stated that a conference with the Misseriya is 
needed so that the Dinka can teach the Misseriya to stay in one 
place. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  Progress on Abyei's development continues to be 
extremely slow despite significant efforts by the international 
community.  Progress toward peaceful co-existence between the Ngok 
Dinka of Abyei and their northern neighbors is also shaky.  Ngok 
Dinka leaders in Abyei display complex and ambivalent feelings 
toward the Misseriya.  Ngok Dinka frequently emphasize that the 
Misseriya are not enemies of the Dinka, and blame the NCP for 
conflict in the area.  On the other hand, the Ngok Dinka in Abyei 
universally want Abyei's boundaries demarcated and want Abyei 
declared Dinka land, an idea that is anathema to the Misseriya. 
Furthermore, Ngok Dinka in Abyei probably fear the Misseriya and 
look forward to the protection of the Sudan People's Liberation Army

that would come with Abyei's inclusion in an independent southern 
Sudan.  A peace conference of traditional leaders might help diffuse 
tensions at the tribal level, or it might reveal to both sides the 
stark differences between their two visions for the future of Abyei. 
 End Comment.
