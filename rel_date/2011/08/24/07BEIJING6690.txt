Dalai Lama Visit Will "Seriously Hurt" Relations 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. At the October 16 regular MFA press briefing, MFA 
Spokesman Liu Jianchao said the Dalai Lama's meetings with 
senior U.S. officials and his receiving the Congressional 
Gold Medal of Honor would "seriously hurt" U.S.-China 
relations.  He said that China considered the Dalai Lama's 
meetings in Washington "a serious violation of the 
fundamental rules of international relations" and stressed 
China's "resolute opposition" to the Dalai Lama's receiving 
the award.  Liu stressed that China urges the United States 
to heed China's "solemn representations" on the matter, 
cancel "relevant arrangements," and "stop interfering in 
China's internal matters."  Liu also said that China is 
resolute in its protection of "state sovereignty and 
territorial integrity." 
 
Iran Meeting Cancelled for "Technical Reasons" 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. Asked if the cancellation of PRC participation in this 
week's scheduled meeting on the Iran nuclear issue (i.e., the 
P5-Plus-1 Political Directors' meeting) was connected to the 
Gold Medal of Honor, Liu reiterated China's opposition to the 
Dalai Lama's visit, but said that China dropped out of the 
meeting for "technical reasons."  He stressed that the 
Chinese position on the Iranian nuclear issue remains 
unchanged.  Liu added that China had informed the other 
members and would consult with them regarding rescheduling 
the meeting. 
 
¶4.  When asked if the cancellation of National People's 
Congress Chairman Wu Bangguo's scheduled visit to the United 
States next month was because of the Dalai Lama visit, Liu 
said only that China was continuing "close contact" with the 
United States and would "continue communication."  A 
follow-on question asked if the date for the Strategic 
Economic Dialogue could be affected and Liu replied that he 
had no specific information on any affect the situation might 
have on the SED schedule. 
 
¶5.  Asked about a U.S. official's comment that President Bush 
had informed President Hu of the Dalai Lama's visit to the 
United States during their bilateral meeting on the margins 
of the APEC summit last month, Liu said China had known about 
the visit in advance and had expressed formal opposition to 
the United States on multiple occasions. 
 
Sudan 
----- 
 
¶6.  On the Sudan People's Liberation Movement's (SPLM's) 
recall of senior officials from the National Unity 
Government, Liu said China is following the situation and 
believes that the Sudan National Congress and the SPLM will 
work to maintain peace and settle their differences through 
dialogue "from an overall situation of national solidarity 
and national reconciliation."  He urged both sides to 
implement the North-South peace agreement.

Gambari Visit to China 
---------------------- 
 
¶7.  When asked if UN Special Envoy to Burma Ibrahim Gambari 
would visit China during his current trip to Asia, Liu said 
that China welcomes his visit, but that specific arrangements 
are "still under discussion." 
 
Arrest of Organ-Seller Connected to Japanese Firm 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶8.  Liu confirmed that an individual associated with the 
Japanese-funded firm IPC Info Ltd Corp. in Shenyang was 
arrested for using a website called "The China International 
Orga Transplant Support Center" to arrange organ trnsplants 
in China for Japanese, in violation of the company's 
"jurisdiction and registration," as well as Ministry of 
Health regulations.  Liu said that China is taking measures 
against other individuals and that the investigation is 
ongoing. 
 
Houses Torn Down for 17th Party Congress? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  Asked about reports that the Chinese government 
demolished "many houses" ahead of the opening of the 17th 
Party Congress, Liu responded that China "cannot accept this 
accusation."  He added, however, that the 17th Congress is a 
very important event in the political life of China and as 
such requires a "good environment," and that the government 
made "relevant arrangements" in accord with the law. 
 
Nobel Peace Prize 
----------------- 
 
¶10.  When asked about China's reaction to the awarding of the 
Nobel Peace Prize to former Vice President Gore and the UN 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Liu said 
that the PRC appreciates the positive contribution that Gore 
and the IPCC have made in promoting cooperation on an issue 
of international concern and offered China's congratulations.
