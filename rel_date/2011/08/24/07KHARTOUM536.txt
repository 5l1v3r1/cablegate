Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) On March 26, U.N. Under Secretary General (U/SYG) for 
Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator John Holmes 
briefed the donor community on his trip to Sudan, which included 
visits to Juba and Darfur and meetings with various government 
officials.  Holmes voiced concern over the impact of increasing 
insecurity and continuing Sudanese government bureaucratic 
impediments to humanitarian operations that are collectively 
hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid in Darfur.  In addition, 
Holmes highlighted the lack of protection and vulnerability of the 
Darfur civilian population to acts of violence and attacks by armed 
groups.  Holmes briefly discussed the Southern Sudan leg of his trip 
noting the impressive will of the population to rebuild and 
underlining the U.N.'s continued focus on the rehabilitation of the 
region. 
 
¶2.  (U) The U/SYG reported that the U.N.'s efforts to set up an 
Oversight Committee with the Government of National Unity (GNU) to 
address ongoing bureaucratic impediments are currently stalled due 
to Sudanese government objections to donor participation.  Charg 
d'Affaires (CDA) Hume emphasized the United States Government (USG) 
interest in results, regardless of the mechanism and composition of 
the committee.  End summary.

Situation on the Ground 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) U/SYG Holmes acknowledged that the humanitarian effort in 
Darfur has been successful in stabilizing conditions for internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) and in addressing the basic needs of IDPs. 
However, insecurity continues to hinder humanitarian access to 
displaced populations, and jeopardizes the safety of U.N. and 
non-governmental organization (NGO) staff, placing the entire 
humanitarian effort at risk. 
 
¶4.  (U) U/SYG Holmes identified the growing militarization of IDP 
camps as the most alarming impression of his visit.  Armed groups 
increasingly control camps, characterized by the growing prevalence 
of weapons inside IDP camps.  During his trip, the Sudanese 
government prevented U/SYG Holmes from visiting Kassab camp in 
Kutum, North Darfur, although later apologized, citing a breakdown 
in communication for the denied access.  Holmes also visited Jebel 
Marra, controlled by the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) faction led 
by Abdul Wahid al-Nur, where he was greeted by crowds who 
predominantly support the U.N. and the humanitarian effort.  U/SYG 
Holmes noted the need for improved access to services in the area. 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
Meeting with Government Ministers 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) U/SYG Holmes relayed that in a meeting with the GNU Second 
Vice President Taha, Taha had expressed the government's 
appreciation for the work of the international community and its 
willingness to assist in resolving current obstacles, but had 
emphasized the need for NGOs to obey government regulations.  Holmes 
identified the Sudanese government's failure to issue travel and 
work permits, breaches of the U.N. Status of Forces Agreement 
(SOFA), and the introduction of new NGO legislation as significant 
obstacles to NGO operations.  Holmes further encouraged the 
government not to determine the quality of NGOs based on their level 
of engagement in protection or advocacy work, but indicated that 
protection is a part of the humanitarian package and should be 
treated as such. 
 
¶6.  (U) Holmes also met with Senior Assistant to the President of 
the GNU and SLM faction leader Minni Minawi and discussed the 
Gereida situation, noting that recent events in Gereida, including 
the March 5 attack on African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) troops, 
were damaging the morale of the humanitarian community.  Minawi 
conveyed to Holmes that SLM/Minawi had investigated the situation 
and that initial findings indicated that some of those involved may 
have defected from his movement.  Holmes viewed GNU First Vice 
President Salva Kiir's efforts to bring the non-signatories of the 
Darfur Peace Agreement together as the one positive development in 
the current Darfur environment.

¶7.  (U) Holmes also reported on U.N. efforts to establish an 
Oversight Committee with the GNU to address bureaucratic 
impediments.  Holmes noted that discussions on the Oversight 
Committee were stalled due to Sudanese government objections to 
donor participation, which have raised significant concerns among 
U.N. agencies and NGOs operating in Sudan.  In response, CDA 
emphasized USG interest in results, regardless of the mechanism and 
composition of the committee, stating that the USG would not insist 
on participating.
