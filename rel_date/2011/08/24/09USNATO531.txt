Statement by the Secretary General on the inauguration of 
President Karzai 
 
On behalf of NATO, I congratulate President Karzai on taking 
office for his second term as leader of Afghanistan.  This is 
an historic event: the second time in modern Afghan history 
that a government has taken office peacefully.  It is a 
testimony to the courage of the Afghan people, and their 
determination to exercise their hard-won democratic right to 
choose their own leaders. 
 
President Hamid Karzai has our best wishes for his second 
five-year term.  We strongly support his intention to form a 
capable and inclusive administration, and to make it 
accountable, one in which corruption has no place.  It is 
critically important that the Afghan people, and the citizens 
of the countries sending troops to the international mission, 
see concrete progress in this regard. 
 
We are entering a time of transition.  Afghans will 
increasingly take leadership of their own affairs.  NATO, 
through the International Security Assistance Force, will 
work with the new Government to enable the Afghan National 
Security Forces to assume lead responsibility for their 
country's security, district by district and province by 
province, when conditions permit.
