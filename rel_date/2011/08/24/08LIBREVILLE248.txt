In support of Cuba Solidarity Day, Post issued a press 
release drawing from points in the sample editorial provided 
in reftel.  In light of the small Cuban presence in Gabon, 
Post felt that it was not necessary to host any outreach 
events.  In response, one local Gabonese official lauded this 
initiative, and praised the American people for their courage 
to reach out to the Cuban people in this manner.
