In Today's Papers 
 
Erdogan Challenges the EU in the Heart of Europe (Tercuman) 
Media outlets note Prime Minister Erdogan went to Brussels this 
weekend in order to face EU criticism that Turkey's accession reform 
process has stalled.  During his visit, Erdogan assured the EU 
Turkey would continue its reforms, warned them that Turkey could 
withdraw its support from the Nabucco pipeline project if an energy 
chapter remains unopened in Turkey's EU bid, and rejected calls for 
Turkey to cut ties with Iran.  Mainstream Miliyet carries the banner 
headline, "Nabucco Is Important to the EU."  Mainstream Sabah 
reports in "Turkey's Energy Card to the EU," that Erdogan said, 
"Turkey will review its support of the Nabucco project if no 
accession chapters are opened regarding energy."  Liberal Radikal 
calls the move, "A Nabucco Gamble In Response to the Cyprus 
Blockage" in Turkey's EU membership negotiations, noting Erdogan 
said, "Turkey will review its role in the Nabucco project if the 
Greek Cypriots continue to block accession negotiations on energy 
for political reasons."  Mainstream Hurriyet reports, "Erdogan 
rejected criticism of Turkey's ties to Iran by saying, 'no one can 
meddle in Turkey's relations with Iran.'"  Mainstream Aksam reports, 
"Erdogan Rejects the West's Calls to Cut Ties with Iran." 
Mainstream Hurriyet notes Erdogan "reported that an unnamed Israeli 
official said that Israel arrested top Hamas leaders in order to 
please Palestinian President Abbas," and Hurriyet calls these 
comments, "shocking."  Hurriyet columnist Ferai Tinc says "Erdogan 
lobbied in support of Hamas" during his visit in Brussels and Tinc 
calls his use of the Nabucco project, "energy blackmail." 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak carries the headline, "There's No 
Slowing Down in Turkey's Reforms."  Islamist-oriented Zaman reports 
Erdogan gave "Guarantees to the EU that 2009 Will Be the Year of 
Reform." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Erdogan's Remarks in Brussels 
 
On Sunday, 1/19, Semih Idiz wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "Because 
of PM Erdogan's harsh criticism of Israel in Brussels this weekend, 
the PM has placed Turkey in the radical camp.  Hamas is now thankful 
to PM Erdogan because of his direct and open support for Hamas. 
Erdogan's support for Hamas went above and beyond the support given 
to Hamas from key countries in the region such as Egypt, Jordan and 
Saudi Arabia.  At this point, Turkey can only work with Hamas 
because Erdogan's remarks have cost Ankara its capacity to mediate 
with anyone else." 
 
On Sunday, January 19, Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal-intellectual 
Radikal: "Erdogan's weekend visit to Brussels was important because 
this was the first time since 2004 Erdogan traveled to Brussels 
entirely for the EU agenda.  This provides hope that Turkey-EU ties 
may thaw after their 2004 de facto freeze." 
 
Turkey Alkan wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal: "The prime 
minister of this country is saying that two-thirds of Israeli soil 
belongs to Palestinians.  PM Erdogan's rhetoric has clearly created 
a diplomatic scandal." 
 
Davutoglu: "Turkey Convinced Hamas to Declare a Ceasefire" 
Mainstreams Sabah and Milliyet, and Islamist-oriented Zaman report 
the prime minister's chief foreign policy strategist, Ahmet 
Davutoglu, told reporters, "Thanks to Turkey, Hamas agreed to a 
ceasefire," and Davutoglu coined Turkey "the conscience of the 
region," due to its efforts to work with Hamas. "We went back and 
forth between Egypt and Syria for seven days," said Davutoglu. 
"Turkey is not trying to steal Egypt's role in the process; without 
Egypt, there can be no solution in Gaza." 
 
Retired Gendarme Intelligence Officer Found Dead 
Media outlets report retired Colonel Abdulkerim Kirca, the former 
commander of gendarme intelligence service JITEM in Diyarbakir, 
committed suicide in Ankara yesterday.  Kirca was facing trial for 
 
ANKARA 00000094  002 OF 003 
 
 
13 murders in southeast Turkey.  According to papers, Kirca's 
suicide came after press reports linked him to the murders and 
reports that he may have carried out the murders as a member of the 
shadowy 'Ergenekon' deep state gang.  Conservative-nationalist Star 
reported Monday a PKK informant testified that he witnessed Kirca 
killing at least three people.  Leftist Taraf says Kirca was a 
"nightmare" for the Kurds when he was posted to the Diyarbakir. 
Papers note that in 2004, Kirca was awarded a state medal by former 
President Sezer.  In his suicide letter, Kirca complained that the 
same state which awarded him a medal of honor is now accusing him of 
murder based on "lies from PKK informants." 
 
Israel's Withdrawal is a Good Will Gesture to Obama (Cumhuriyet) 
Media outlets conclude the timing of Israel's withdrawal from Gaza 
is no coincidence.  Leftist Taraf headlines, "Olmert Withdraws for 
Obama."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports, "Israel puts on the 
brakes to the massacre prior to Obama's inauguration ceremony." 
Mainstream Milliyet says, "Obama's Shadow is Sufficient," to prompt 
Israel to withdraw from Gaza prior to his inauguration.  Milliyet 
columnist Sami Kohen opines, "Israeli attacks have ceased prior to 
Obama's inauguration," but "Obama's silence on the Israeli attacks 
in Gaza appear to be an expression of his support of Israel." 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak's headline screams, "They Burned, They 
Destroyed, and They Are Withdrawing," as Israeli "Jets Withdraw for 
Obama."  Hurriyet columnist Cuneyt Ulsever comments, "Obama will 
never embrace Hamas," and Obama's team "must have noticed Erdogan's 
stated support for Hamas and Iran and his statements fueling 
anti-Semitism." 
 
The Dream Comes True Today (Sabah) 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports in a front-page banner headline, 
"The U.S. Begins a New Era with Obama."  Mainstream Vatan reports, 
"The World Will Not Miss Bush."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet 
reports, "Bush Left the World in Ruins," as "The U.S. Enjoys a 
Climate of Celebration," prior to Obama's inauguration today. 
Columnist Cuneyt Ulsever of mainstream Hurriyet comments, "Obama is 
expected to open a new chapter for the U.S. and the world." 
 
 
A photo from leftist Taraf shows Afro-Turks in the Western province 
of Mugla, Turkey.  Their sign says, "Afro-Turks Love You Very Much," 
and the organizer of the group invited Obama to meet the Afro-Turk 
community in Mugla. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Israel/Gaza-Washington 
 
Fehmi Koru wrote in Islamist leaning Yeni Safak: "Given the timing 
of the Gaza attacks and the timing of ceasefire, Israel sent a clear 
message to the Obama administration that Washington must consider 
the Israel factor in every step the U.S. plans to take regarding the 
Middle East." 
 
Thousands Commemorate Hrant Dink 
All papers report that slain Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink 
was commemorated Monday on the second anniversary of his death. 
Thousands gathered outside the Istanbul office of his Agos 
newspaper, the very spot he was shot dead.  Those who attended the 
ceremony chanted slogans saying "we are all Hrant, we are all 
Armenians."  Some carried banners which read "for Hrant, for 
justice." 
 
Costly Tender for Turkey's Nuclear  Plant 
Hurriyet, Vatan, Milliyet, Sabah:  Turkish businessman Turgay Ciner 
and his Russian partner were the sole bidders in a tender to build 
Turkey's first nuclear power plant.  However, the consortium offered 
a costly price for electricity that will be sold to the state from 
the nuclear power plant, which will be established in Akkuyu in 
southern province of Mersin.  Mainstream Sabah qotes Energy Minister 
Guler as saying "we returned the revised tender envelope because 
there is an alternative envelope to replace this one."
