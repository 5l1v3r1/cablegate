PolOff delivered demarche (ref a) to Zvi Rav-Ner, Director of 
the MFA Central Europe Department, on March 4.  Although 
Israel has yet to recognize Kosovo, PolOff suggested that 
given its history of past contributions, Israel may be able 
to contribute to areas that are not directly related to 
sovereignty such as agriculture, education or health. 
Rav-Ner replied that it may be possible for Israel to 
contribute along those lines and he promised to study the 
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).  He said the GOI 
would notify the U.S. in advance if Israel decided to make a 
pledge for the conference.
