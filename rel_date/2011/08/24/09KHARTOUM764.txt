¶1. (SBU) Poloffs met with Government of Sudan (GOS) Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) Acting Director of the Americas Desk 
Ambassador Yassir Mohammed Ali on June 17 to inform him of the 
release of the 2009 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report.  Receiving 
the copies of the TIP Report for Sudan, Ambassador Ali thanked 
poloffs.  He said  Sudan is working on improving its performance on 
TIP-related issues.  Polchief noted that despite its Tier 3 ranking, 
Sudan has made some limited improvements in TIP, including 
increasing its cooperation with UNICEF on issues of child 
protection, and passing the 2008 Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) Act.  The 
latter outlaws the recruitment of child soldiers in the SAF. Poloff 
drew attention to the areas for improvement cited in the report. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Amb. Ali said that the passage of the 2008 SAF Act will 
ensure that Sudan follows international conventions by not enlisting 
children into its armed forces, and reminded poloffs that rebel 
groups active in Darfur still recruit minors  for armed conflict. 
Regarding both smuggling and trafficking in Eastern Sudan, Amb. Ali 
said that Sudanese borders with Eritrea, Ethiopia and Egypt are long 
and difficult to protect.  He maintained that that the GOS views its 
problems with TIP - both as a source and transit country - as ones 
that must be solved regionally, especially with the cooperation of 
Egypt.
