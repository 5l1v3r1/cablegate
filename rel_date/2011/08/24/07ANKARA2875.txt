SUBJECT: Update on PKK Violence (November 24-31, 2007) 
 
REF: ANKARA 2853 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) website.  TGS does not account for police casualties and 
Ministry of Interior casualty data is not made public.  As a result, 
actual numbers for total Turkish law enforcement casualties may be 
higher than the figures in this cable.  Press services sympathetic 
to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's Defense Forces and Firat 
News Agency, tend to report higher numbers of Turkish security force 
casualties and are often otherwise unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) During the November 24-31, 2007 reporting period, no GOT 
security official was killed or injured in clashes.  The total 
number of security force casualties for the year through November 
2007 was 138 killed and 216 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same period, one PKK terrorist was killed and two 
were captured.  Through the end of November 2007, the number of PKK 
militants killed this year was 267, the number of those captured was 
177, and the number of those who surrendered was 77. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported two clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists during the week of November 24-31.  Since an 
October 21 PKK ambush that resulted in the deaths of 12 soldiers, 
the Turkish military has been continuing non-stop operations in the 
region. 
 
¶5. (U) During the reporting period, security forces discovered five 
PKK shelters/caves/caches, and detected/disarmed three improvised 
explosive devices in SE Turkey. 
 
¶6. (U) Seven Turkish citizens, including two village guards, who 
were kidnapped by the PKK on November 11, were released and returned 
to their homes in Baskale, Van Province on November 30. Civilian 
casualties for the year remain 26 killed and 134 wounded.
