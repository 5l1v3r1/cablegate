FORMER POLITICAL PARTNER 
 
REF: 07 ANKARA 2004 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Democratic Left Party (DSP) is targeting 
its former political partner -- the Republican People's Party 
(CHP) -- in the upcoming local elections, according to 
Mustafa Aslan, Istanbul Chair of the DSP.  Despite an 
alliance that yielded 13 seats in Parliament for DSP, Aslan 
said an association with CHP and its leader Deniz Baykal does 
more harm than good to DSP.  Aslan was also critical of those 
who highlight social problems, since it detracts from the 
core issue facing Turkey -- the economy.  Aslan also blamed 
the press for claiming DSP is engaged in a bitter power 
struggle. End Summary. 
 
 
Targeting CHP in the Local Elections 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mustafa Aslan, Istanbul DSP Chair, explained to us 
the party's strategy targeting former political partner of 
convenience, CHP.   While Aslan also talked about defeating 
the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the 
upcoming March local election, he said that DSP's immediate 
target is CHP.  DSP needs to recruit a strong candidate to 
unseat the existing CHP mayor of Bakirkoy, Aslan said. 
Commenting on CHP's lack of grassroots support, he quipped, 
"there is no 'people' in the Republican People's Party". 
 
¶3. (SBU) Aslan claimed partnering with CHP in the 2007 
national election hurt DSP.  While the partnership allowed 13 
DSP members to enter parliament (reftel), DSP's connection 
with Baykal caused great harm to the party; Baykal's 
criticism of those benefitting from AKP's social programs 
lost votes for the DSP.  The alliance with CHP gave the 
public the impression DSP was "anti-religion", when in fact 
DSP views religion as a personal choice and believes economic 
issues should be the government's primary focus. 
 
 
It's the Economy, Stupid 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Aslan stressed that economic problems are the main 
issues facing Turkey today.  High personal credit card debt, 
increasing inflation and joblessness are Turks' primary 
concerns.   Aslan claimed only one percent of Turks care 
about lifting the headscarf ban in universities, yet AKP 
focused on this issue to distract voters from existing 
economic problems. 
 
 
Leadership Fight is Exaggerated 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Aslan maintained a biased media is distorting 
accounts of a bitter power struggle between DSP Chairman Zeki 
Sezer and Rahsan Ecevit, wife of former Chairman and Prime 
Minister Bulent Ecevit. Aslan told us internal suggestions 
from Ecevit were inappropriately leaked and exaggerated to 
imply a power struggle.  Aslan assured us Sezer remains the 
undisputed leader of the party. 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Istanbul DSP branch strategy to focus on CHP 
strongholds in the local elections will likely divide the 
center-left vote, to the benefit of AKP.  With DSP polling in 
the low single digits, its strategy will likely cause it to 
be a spoiler, and a weak one at that.  The DSP fixation on 
defeating the CHP could cause it to be shut out in the local 
elections in Istanbul. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Despite Aslan's claims, DSP appears to be facing a 
leadership struggle that also influences the future of the 
party.  According to press accounts, Ecevit wants to replace 
Sezer with a centrist leader who could attract more voters on 
the right.  However, with party rules stacked in Sezer's 
favor, he will likely remain at the helm of a marginalized 
DSP.
