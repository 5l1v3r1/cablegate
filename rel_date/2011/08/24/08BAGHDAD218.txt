¶1. (U) Post has contacted the Multi-National Security 
Transition Command in Iraq (MNSTC-I) and they confirm that 
this is a legitimate purchase of ammunition by the Iraqi 
Army. The M855 ammunition is often referred to as "5.56 ball" 
and is the most commonly fired round for the M-16 / M-4 
carbine. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Currently, MNSTC-I has issued just over 30,000 M-16 
variants and has an additional 15,000 in stock awaiting issue 
in conjunction with unit set fielding.  This will equip six 
Iraqi divisions and the Presidential Brigade--which amounts 
to just over half of the current Iraqi Army strength. 
MNSTC-I assesses that this order of 39 million rounds will 
not satisfy the base line requirements for Iraqi Army units 
"basic loads and individual qualification standards". They 
advise that DTCC should anticipate additional orders of this 
same ammunition in these amounts. 
 
¶3. (U) Regarding the bona fides of Mr. Stuart Watkins, 
MNSTC-I confirms that he is a U.S. government contractor 
under their direct employment. Mr. Watkins manages the 
MNSTC-I fielding plan for equipping the Iraqi Security Forces 
with the M-16/M-4 carbine.
