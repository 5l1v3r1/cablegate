SUBJECT: AI - SUPARI INTERVIEW RAISES SCIENCE VS. POLITICS ANALYSIS 
 
 
¶1. (U) In a December 19 online interview in the journal "Nature", 
Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari reiterated her position that 
developed countries benefit from the sharing of avian influenza 
virus samples at the expense of poorer, developing countries (full 
text available at: 
http://emboj.org/news/2007/071219/full/450113 7a.html).  Supari 
emphasized that there must be a system to track virus samples and 
that commercial companies seeking to create a vaccine from any 
sample must negotiate with that sample's source country.  She stated 
that the key outstanding concession that Indonesia demands from the 
World Health Organization is that all shared virus samples be 
subject to a material transfer agreement (MTA).  Supari praised the 
Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), which 
she considered a "fair and transparent" mechanism for regulating 
genetic-sequencing databases because it includes a MTA. 
 
POLITICS VS. SCIENCE 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) In a December 31 op-ed piece, Jakarta Post journalist Emmy 
Fitri, who has written several pieces on AI, questioned the timing 
and purpose of Supari's politically motivated stance (copy emailed 
to EAP/MTS and G/AIAG).  Rather than playing the victim in front of 
the international community, Fitri suggested that the minister would 
better serve the country by using her political skills to secure 
funding from the parliament and provincial authorities to combat AI 
domestically. 
 
¶3. (U) Fitri proposed that the top priority for preventing 
AI-related deaths should be public education on proper poultry 
handling.  Despite living in a hotbed for germs and viruses, she 
added, Indonesians show little awareness of good sanitary practices. 
 She blamed the gap on the government's failure to prioritize money 
and strategies to strengthen the health sector.  If anything has to 
be politicized, she concluded, the GOI should use political 
diplomacy to raise awareness of the threat from AI and coordinate 
efforts to manage the human and health sectors.
