Bosworth Trip to China Following his Visit to North Korea 
--------------------------- ----------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the December 10 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Jiang Yu said U.S. Special Representative for 
North Korea Policy Ambassador Stephen Bosworth will arrive December 
11 in Beijing and plans to meet with Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi 
and Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawai to exchange views on the North 
Korea situation.  China hopes all sides will show flexibility so 
that dialogue and negotiations may continue, said Jiang.  China also 
hopes these talks will ultimately lead to resumption of the 
Six-Party Talks.  When asked if the Chinese have spoken to DPRK 
officials, Jiang replied she has no such information. 
 
Copenhagen Concerns 
------------------- 
 
¶3. China understands the concerns of all the participants to the 
Copenhagen Conference, Jiang said.  It is an obligation of developed 
countries to ensure that support is provided to all countries on 
climate change issues.  China hopes developing countries give 
reasonable appeals to developed countries to enhance cooperation and 
coordination, she said.  The goal is to enhance the roadmap of the 
Kyoto Protocol and "this should not be given up."  Nations must have 
the political will for an agreement acceptable to all, said Jiang.

to Taiwan and has urged the United States to adhere to the Three 
Joint Communiques.

spokesperson said.
