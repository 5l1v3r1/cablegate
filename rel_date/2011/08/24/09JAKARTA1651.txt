¶1.  The following information is current as of 11:00 local time. 
 
CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND 
 
¶2.  There have been no reports of significant aftershocks since the 
major earthquake of September 30 (reftel).  However, any buildings 
over two stories have either collapsed or sustained extensive 
damage.  Despite heavy rains, the majority of the residents is too 
afraid to return to their homes and is finding shelter under 
makeshift tents or simply doing without.  GOI officials report that 
food and clean water supplies are sufficient for now but express 
concern that if the power shortage continues and roads remain 
blocked, shortages will appear.  Eighty percent of the electrical 
power is out in the affected area, as well as communication 
facilities.  Moreover, due to rapidly dwindling fuel supplies use of 
generators is limited.  Hotel space is nonexistent. 
 
DEATHS AND INJURIES 
 
¶3.  As expected the number of deaths and injuries has increased 
significantly since last night.  The GOI estimates that 777 have 
died, while the UN estimates over 1,100 dead with more expected. 
Unconfirmed reports place the number of injured in excessQ 10,000 
although the official figure standQat 440.  As noted reftel there 
are still no reports of Amcit victims. 
 
GOI NATIONAL AND LOCAL EFFORTS 
 
¶4.  The Padang mayor and local officials has established a command 
center in Padang.  The center will handle communications, 
interagency coordinatiQ and serve as the meeting point for missing 
people.  The Governor's office, with assistance from DOJ, has been 
set up as the National Disaster Management Command Center. 
 
¶5.  President Yudhoyono and several of his ministers and staff flew 
to Padang last night in order to assess the situation.  Due to the 
lack of accommodations, they reportedly spent the night in a cement 
factory and will return to Jakarta this afternoon.  Both the 
Indonesian military and police are on the ground with supplies of 
medicine, blankets, tents and other supplies needed for short term 
relief. 
 
USG EFFORTS 
 
¶6.  In line with President Obama's October 1 remarks to the press, 
Embassy Jakarta is working closely with the GOI to offer appropriate 
assistance.  Through USAID's office of U.S. Foreign Disaster 
Assistance, we have USD300, 000 ready to be allocated to address the 
most immediate needs.  Additionally, we have allocated an additional 
USD3 million which we will provide once all needs have been properly 
determined.  The USG is also deploying a disaster assistance rapid 
reaction team (DARRT) to arrive Sunday.  DOD has reprogrammed a USAF 
C-130, here for a training exercise, to ferry personnel and 
equipment to Padang.  We will seek additional assistance, in 
cooperation with the GOI, as needs are identified. 
 
¶7.  Seven embassy personnel, including consular and Justice 
officers, arrived in Padang on Thursday night.  They are staying in 
the lobby of the Padang Hotel and have sporadic satellite phone, as 
well as more reliable cell phone contact with the Embassy.  They are 
trying to locate Americans and assist the GOI set up a command post. 
 Padang, Jakarta and Medan are tracking Americans, by phone and on 
foot at the scene.  All updates are entered into the crisis database 
in CCD.  We have no outstanding Amcit emergency cases.  Two Embassy 
SUVs loaded with supplies left Jakarta overland for Padang on 
Thursday night.  PACOM personnel depart for Padang Friday afternoon. 
Other Embassy staff, including Defense and consular personnel, will 
go to Padang on Saturday.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to 
obtain commercial air seats. 
 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
 
¶8.  As reported reftel, the UNOCHA convened a NGO/Red Cross/Donor 
Coordination meeting the evening of October 1. The group noted that 
although the GOI has welcomed international assistance, it must be 
provided in close cooperation with Indonesian authorities.  The 
National Body for Disaster Response will take the lead among 
Indonesian ministries and agencies.  A number of donors in the 
region; Australia, Japan, Singapore and China, have responded with 
search and rescue assistance, including supplies and personnel. 
Mercy Corps, operating in Padang, will serve as the coordinator for 
NGOs in the Padang region.
