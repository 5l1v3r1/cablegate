BRIEFING 
 
Ambassador Wilson Meets Turkish Officials:  US Ambassador to 
Ankara, Ross Wilson, had lunch on Tuesday with the Turkey-US 
Parliamentary Friendship Group, including AKP lawmaker and 
the head of the group Egemen Bagis, the head of the 
parliamentary commission for foreign affairs Mehmet Dulger, 
and Culture Minister Atilla Koc, papers report.  Wilson said 
during the lunch that the fight against the PKK will 
continue, and that a special package of measures will be 
implemented against the terror organization, adding that 
Turkey, the US and Iraq had to carry out their 
responsibilities in the fight against terrorism.  The 
Ambassador stressed that tackling the PKK problem only in 
northern Iraq was not enough, and that cooperation with 
European countries was needed.  "Zaman" quotes Ambassador 
Wilson as saying that the US and Turkey have a `close and 
effective' working relationship in the fight against 
terrorism, and that the determination that has been 
displayed by the US administration and President Bush with 
regard to the PKK continues.  According to Wilson, the US 
administration believes that an effective government in Iraq 
will mean better protection of borders and prevention of 
terror.  Wilson noted that he called his old friend 
Ambassador Unal Cevikoz in Baghdad after the Turkish envoy 
survived an assassination attempt on Monday.  `The attack 
against Ambassador Cevikoz shook us,' Wilson said.  He also 
stated that military action against Iran and Syria was not 
on the agenda of the US.  Wilson said that he wanted to 
establish direct contact with Turkish people and lawmakers 
to reduce anti-American sentiments in Turkey.  Turkish

lawmakers attending the lunch said in response to Wilson's 
remarks that ties between Turkey and the United States will 
be better.  Former Turkish FM Yasar Yakis told Wilson that 
the word `crisis' had two meanings in Chinese.  `It connotes 
both a risk and an opportunity.  We must create an 
opportunity out of the negatives we have experienced,' Yakis 
said.  "Radikal" reports Wilson as saying that the US will 
hold meetings with Russia to seek a settlement of the Cyprus 
problem. 
 
Erdogan Assures Putin Turkey Will Not Allow US to Strike 
Iran:  "Hurriyet," quoting unidentified US intelligence 
sources, reports from Washington that in July 2005, Prime 
Minister Erdogan `guaranteed' Russian President Putin that 
permission will not be given to the US to use Turkish bases 
to stage an attack against Iran.  Erdogan's commitment 
necessitated visits by a number of high-level US officials, 
including FBI and CIA directors, to Turkey, in an effort to 
ensure Ankara's support in possible military operations 
against Iran, the US sources said.  During a recent visit to 
the US, Land Forces Commander General Yasar Buyukanit was 
also asked to provide logistics, intelligence and security 
support to the US in case of a military attack against Iran. 
In an effort to convince Turkey, FBI Director Mueller 
allegedly presented Turkish officials with documents showing 
Iranian support for the PKK.  Erdogan merely listened to the 
demands of visiting US officials, and gave no pledges.  The 
inflence of Putin is strong enough to block Turkish support 
for the US, "Hurriyet" comments. 
 
US Can Strike Iran Without Using Turkish Bases:  "Hurriyet" 
reports from Washington unidentified US intelligence sources 
as saying that President Bush has almost completed his plans 
for striking nuclear facilities in various provinces in 
Iran.  The US has asked for the support of several NATO 
countries, as well as Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, 
Pakistan, Oman and Azerbaijan.  Poland has promised to give 
all necessary backing to the US.  An unidentified US 
military expert told "Hurriyet" that the US had the capacity 
to carry out an extensive military operation against Iran 
without using Turkish bases or airspace. 
 
Rice to Visit Turkey:  Turkish papers report that Secretary 
Rice will visit Turkey either this month or in February to 
discuss Iran, Syria, and the PKK. 
 
Ahmadinejad Wants to Visit Turkey:  The all-news broadcaster 
NTV said in a commentary on Wednesday that Iranian President 
Ahmadinejad wanted to make his first official trip abroad to 
Turkey before the `Nevruz' feast in April, the beginning of 
the new year in Iran.  The Iranian government, under 
international pressure regarding its nuclear program, is 
preparing a regional tour for Ahmadinejad in an effort to 
establish closer ties with regional countries.  Ankara, 
bearing in mind the recent remarks by Ahmadinejad on Israel, 
and Tehran's refusal to cooperate on nuclear issues, is 
reluctant to host the Iranian president.  Tehran wants 
Ankara to renew an invitation that had been made by 
President Sezer to former President Khatami during a visit 
to Iran in 2002.  Diplomatic sources believe that inviting 
Ahmadinejad at a time when Secretary Rice is preparing to 
visit Turkey will annoy the US Administration, NTV said. 
 
Karzai Due to Visit Turkey:  Afghan President Hamid Karzai 
will visit Turkey from January 4-7 as the official guest of 
President Sezer to discuss bilateral relations, Turkey's 
contribution to Afghanistan's rebuilding, and regional 
matters, the Turkish President's office said on Tuesday.

Turkish Anti-Terror Board Works in Coordination with US: 
Turkey's National Security Council (NSC) recommended at a 
meeting in December the use of an anti-terror board chaired 
by Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul to coordinate government 
efforts in the fight against the separatist PKK, "Radikal" 
says in a news commentary.  The Anti-Terror High Board will 
ensure the implementation of action plans for Turkey's 
eastern and southeastern provinces, and foreign, economic 
and social aspects of the fight against the PKK.  After the 
board held its first meeting under the chairmanship of Gul, 
Turkish intelligence agency MIT Undersecretary Emre Taner 
was sent to northern Iraq to meet with Kurdistan regional 
leader Massoud Barzani after the constitutional referendum 
in Iraq on October 15.  Ankara later encouraged the 
participation of Sunni groups in the Iraqi elections on 
December 15.  The process was coordinated with the US as 
seen in the visits of US national security adviser Stephen 
Hadley and CIA Director Porter Goss to Turkey, says 
"Radikal." 
 
Patriarch Bartholomew Travels to US:  The Greek Orthodox 
Patriarch Bartholomew I left for the US on Wednesday to 
attend masses to celebrate the centenary of the Orthodox 
community in the US, Cihan News Agency (CNA) reports.  At a 
press conference before his departure, Bartholomew I said 
that he had been invited by the US Orthodox community in 
Florida.  Bartholomew I noted that he will not hold 
political meetings during his visit. 
 
Report Outlines Human Rights Violations in Turkey in 2005: 
In a report reviewing 2005, Turkish human rights 
organization "Mazlum-Der" highlighted the controversial 
Armenian conference held in Istanbul, and lawsuits against 
novelist Orhan Pamuk, journalist Hrant Dink, and Professor 
Baskin Oran as examples of restrictions on freedom of 
expression in Turkey.  "Yeni Safak" cites the report as 
saying that 203 were killed by unknown assailants, and 336 
were killed in clashes with security forces in Turkey last 
year.  Forty-one infringement of religious freedom cases 
were reported.  Courts ruled for a total of 46 years of 
prison term in a violation of free speech in lawsuits filed 
against several persons.  Sixty-two cases of pressure and 
intimidation against journalists and media outlets were 
reported.  Twelve women were murdered in `honor killings.' 
Asylum rights were violated in 51 cases, and 1,832 
immigrants were freed from human traffickers, according to 
the "Mazlum-Der" report. 
 
Military Support for Bush Declines:  Several Turkish papers 
report that US military support for President Bush's Iraq 
policies has gone down 11 percent in the past year, to 53 
percent last year from 64 percent in 2004, according to a 
survey conducted by "Military Times." 
 
Dogan Group Buys Former Uzan Group TV Stations:  Turkey's 
leading media conglomerate Dogan Group bought on Tuesday 
four cable and satellite TV licenses that previously 
belonged to the Uzan Group for USD 676,000.  The purchases 
strengthened Dogan Group's position as the leading media 
conglomerate in Turkey, papers say. 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION:   Russia's Gas Price War 
 
"The Rage of Russia" 
Sami Kohen observed in the mainstream daily "Milliyet" 
(01/04):  "At a first glance, it seems that it is Russia's 
natural right to increase the price of the natural gas it 
sells to Ukraine, but there are some problematic points in 
 
ANKARA 00000068  004 OF 004 
 
 
the Putin administration's decisions.  The first problem is 
the excessive prices demanded by Russia (a raise from $50 to 
$230).   This goes against trade `laws of feasibility.' 
Secondly, everything indicates that Russia has not only a 
commercial motivation, but a political one as well.  It is 
selling gas to the rich Western Europe countries at a 
relatively high price and to the countries loyal to Russia, 
rather cheaply.  For example, Russia charges Moldovia and 
Georgia $160, Belarus $47 and Armenia $54.  The crisis 
occurred with Ukraine, because Putin wanted to teach Ukraine 
a lesson, damage Yushchenko's influence, and send a message 
to the western world.  Naturally, this situation not only 
caused Russia to clash with Kiev but, with the West as well. 
And that is the most worrying and dangerous part of this 
whole situation.  Immediately after Russia's price increase, 
`cold war' winds started to blow.  No one will benefit from 
such tensions, not even Russia." 
 
"Energy and Strategy" 
Yilmaz Oztuna commented in the conservative-nationalist 
"Turkiye" (01/04):  "The Russian Federation showed the world 
how to use energy as a strategic tool.  Putin decreased gas 
supplies to Ukraine and indirectly sent a warning to 
countries dependent on Russia for gas, including Turkey. 
Under these conditions, the people of Ukraine will 
participate in the March 25 elections in the dark, shivering 
in the cold.  Putin is indirectly warning Ukrainians that if 
they vote for Yushchenko's pro-American, pro-Europe  party 
in the parliamentary elections, than he'll do his best to 
leave them in the dark and in the cold."
