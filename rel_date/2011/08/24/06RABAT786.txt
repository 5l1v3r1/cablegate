SUBJECT: INTERIOR MINISTER'S FIRST INTERVIEW OFFERS GLIMPSE 
INTO MOI PRIORITIES 
 
REF: RABAT 558 
 
¶1.  This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Coming on the heels of his recent visit to France, 
Interior Minister Chakib Benmoussa provided April 19, 2006 
the Moroccan French-language daily L'Economiste his first 
official interview since being appointed head of the Ministry 
of Interior (MOI) by King Mohammed VI.  Although largely 
focused on his April 14-15 visit to France, where he met his 
French counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy, several French political 
figures, and select Moroccan expatriates living in France to 
discuss Moroccan-French security cooperation, ways to stem 
illegal migration, and avenues to involve Moroccans living 
abroad into Moroccan initiatives, his first public dialogue 
with the Moroccan press as Interior Minister provided a 
glimpse into the role he sees the MOI playing under his watch 
(NOTE: The interview was conducted by a L'Economiste 
correspondent in Paris. END NOTE.). 
 
Moroccans Living Abroad: Proud of Morocco,s Direction 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Referencing his interactions with segments of the 
Moroccan community living in France, Benmoussa said Moroccans 
living abroad (or MRE's, according to the French acronym), 
whether third generation or recently established abroad, have 
a "strong attachment" to their country of origin, i.e. 
Morocco, and are "proud" of the reform process taking place. 
MRE's, according to Benmoussa, support the actions King 
Mohammed VI has set in motion since his ascension to the 
throne and stand ready to contribute to the positive changes 
in Morocco, whether through investment in Moroccan business 
ventures or returning to live in Morocco bringing back their 
experiences from abroad. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Speaking on modalities facing Moroccans living 
abroad for the 2007 legislative elections, Benmoussa 
confirmed there is a process underway in Morocco to address 
this issue.  The MOI, in particular, is currently in 
discussions with political parties, which will be followed by 
discussions with the MRE community, in order to define the 
manner in which MRE's will be represented during the 2007 
elections process (comment:  this will be the first election 
in which MRE's will vote).  Hinting at possible movement on 
this issue, Benmoussa said although already moving in a 
positive direction, this process should accelerate in the 
coming weeks. 
 
Illegal Immigration: Cooperation is Key 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Recalling his April 14 meeting with Sarkozy where 
the two interior Ministers discussed the Euro-African 
conference on Migration and Development scheduled for July in 
Rabat, Benmoussa explained the conference is strongly 
supported by France, Spain, and the rest of Europe for 
several reasons.  He argued that the problem of illegal 
immigration affects not only the countries of origin, but 
also the countries of transit and destination, and therefore 
requires the broad support of all involved countries.  He 
underscored this point saying that the responsibility to 
fight illegal immigration should be shared by all concerned 
countries and added this is a problem that must be confronted 
through a comprehensive approach that focuses on 
socioeconomic development strategies, in addition to the 
security aspect.  Although highlighting Moroccan efforts to 
combat this phenomenon during the past several years, 
Benmoussa claimed that regional and international cooperation 
can create favorable conditions for the success of efforts 
fighting illegal migration.  He noted, however, that efforts 
to stop illegal migration must also preserve and reinforce 
the rights of those who regularly visit Europe and return to 
their country of origin, i.e. Moroccans who frequently travel 
legally between Morocco and Europe.  He said that while 
battling illegal migration, there must also be a "valve" 
through which legal migration can take place.  According to 
Benmoussa, it is unrealistic to think Morocco can put the 
brakes on economic globalization. 
 
MOI Playing A Development Role? 
 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Since his appointment as Interior Minister, 
Benmoussa has lead a concerted effort to transform the MOI's 
image, both domestically and abroad.  For example, in an 
effort to make the Ministry's day-to-day functions more 
efficient, he has incorporated his experience from the 
private sector into his management style at the Ministry, 
according to L'Economiste.  In what also appears to be a 
shift towards a more development-focused role for the 
Ministry, Walis and Governors are reportedly being evaluated 
in part based on how well they attract investment to their 
respective regions.  On the political front, the MOI is also 
playing an important role as the Ministry recently kicked off 
a round of consultations with political parties on a new 
electoral code, allegedly at the urging of the Palace.  In a 
likely attempt by the GOM to preempt potential difficulties, 
the MOI is seeking out consensus on issues, such as the 
electoral code, to prevent unexpected opposition down the 
road from opposing voices. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Although no stranger to the MOI after serving as 
MOI Secretary General for the past four years, Benmoussa, as 
Minister, will have several hot-button issues to deal with in 
the coming 18 months, including preparations for the 2007 
legislative elections, likely integration of a Western Sahara 
autonomy plan into the current state structures (along with 
the constitutional amendments such a plan will likely 
necessitate), and development of mechanisms to deal with 
illegal immigration, among others.  For his part, Benmoussa's 
familiarity with MOI operations appears to have made his 
transition relatively smooth, but it will be interesting to 
see if his plans for a new image for the MOI will encounter 
resistance from some of the MOI old guard.  Interestingly, 
Benmoussa and the MOI to date have not followed through on 
their request for an informal, periodic dialogue with the US 
on human rights issues, which was raised reftel and by 
Ambassador Mekouar in Washington.  If the MOI is serious 
about changing its image as "the heavy" on security issues, a 
dialogue on human rights issues could be one area where they 
could have an impact.
