RESHUFFLE 
 
REF: ASHGABAT 1295 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A number of international media outlets, initially 
Russian, have linked recent changes in the Turkmen energy sector's 
leadership (reftel) with allegations that high-ranking oil and gas 
officials had passed classified geological data, related to the 
South Yoloten field, to foreign companies.  In Turkmenistan, the 
recent Russian media reports were seen as nothing more than Russian 
sensationalism designed to discredit Turkmenistan.  Rumors about a 
reshuffling among the Turkmen oil and gas leadership were already 
circulating in Ashgabat months before President Berdimuhamedov's 
recent announcement of the changes.  According to a Ministry of Oil 
and Gas official, the new appointments reflect the intention of 
recently appointed Deputy Chairman for Oil and Gas Baymyrat 
Hojamuhammedov's to create a new team of oil and gas leaders. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Turkmen energy experts pointed out that Turkmennebit (the 
state oil concern) and the Turkmen State Oil and Gas Construction 
Concern, the chairmen of which were replaced, had nothing to do with 
South Yoloten.  They added that Berdimuhamedov appointed a new 
chairman to head Turkmengaz because that position had been vacant 
for three months. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT.  The Gaffney Cline audit of the South Yoloten 
field remains the most competent assessment of its potential 
reserves.  While there are doubts among some experts regarding the 
completeness of the data used in the audit, experts from local state 
companies and foreign companies working in Turkmenistan generally 
think the Gaffney Cline results are realistic.  Concerning the 
personnel changes, it seems unlikely that high-ranking officials, 
likely under the close eye of Turkmen law enforcement and security 
services, would risk passing classified information to foreign 
companies.  In fact, almost all Turkmen officials avoid talking to 
foreigners because they do not want to leave themselves open to 
suspicion.  END COMMENT.
