(SBU) SUMMARY: On May 1, the UK officially took 
k 
charge of the Lashkar Gah PRT in a transfer of 
authority (TOA) ceremony.  The outgoing U.S. 
commander told an audience of UK, U.S. and Afghan 
attendees that U.S. troops can be proud of what they 
achieved.  The new UK commander said that the UK PRT 
will build on the good work that the U.S. 
accomplished.  Local and international media covered 
the event.  The UK PRT civilian and military 
presence will be much greater compared to that of 
the U.S. PRT.  The UK will also bring a different 
approach to security and development.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The long anticipated TOA occurred at 4:30 
PM on May 1.  Representing the provincial government 
(the Governor and the deputy governor were not in 
Lashkar Gah), Ministry of Interior representative to 
the PRT, Colonel Fakhir, told the audience of UK, 
U.S., and provincial government personnel that, on 
behalf of the government, he officially welcomed the 
new UK PRT.  The government very much appreciated 
the help that the U.S. had provided since June 2004 
4 
and looked forward to working with the UK. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The outgoing U.S. commander said that 
U.S. troops could be proud of what they accomplished 
during their one year tour.  (Note:  The civil 
affairs component of the PRT has started or 
completed 75 reconstruction projects, valued at 
about USD 10 million.  End Note).  He expressed his 
admiration for his Afghan counterparts, quoting an 
old Pashto proverb, I may not see you for 1,000 
years, but I will think of you 1,000 times a day. 
As the U.S. PRT commander finished his speech, the 
U.S. flag was lowered and the UK flag raised. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The new UK PRT commander said that he was 
very proud to take on the PRT and contribute to the 
security, governance, and development of Helmand 
province.  He said that the PRT would build on the 
fine work performed by the United States. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The TOA received significant attention 
from the media.  In addition to local television and 
other Afghan journalists, British and Canadian media 
were also represented. 
 
-------------- 
THE TRANSITION 
-------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  The Lashkar Gah PRT has been operated by 
U.S. troops since June 2004, although the present 
camp opened in March 2005.  As a U.S. PRT, the 
population varied from about 90 to 110 soldiers, 
with one civilian representative each from State, 
USAID, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
respectively.  The Texan National Guard provided 
internal security and force protection for the civil 
 
KABUL 00002021  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
affairs contingent and the PRT commander.  The 
Guards mission was to support the commanders 
leadership engagement missions and civil affairs 
reconstruction efforts throughout the province. 
Civil affairs projects reached every district in 
Helmand.  A military police platoon provided basic 
training to the local police.  In October, two U.S. 
police advisors arrived; in February, the first 
Poppy Elimination Program advisor arrived.  The 
second arrived on May 2.  These four officials work 
for DynCorps, a contractor to the State Departments 
Qs 
Bureau of International Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement Affairs. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  In preparation for the transition, a UK 
liaison officer arrived at the PRT in October 2005. 
Following his arrival, UK engineers made several TDY 
visits to survey the camp and plan for the necessary 
changes to support the UK deployment.  In December, 
a UK PRT commander arrived.  He maintained close 
liaison with his U.S. counterpart, learning about 
the issues and activities concerning the PRT.  As UK 
troops began to arrive, they undertook missions, 
such as joint police patrols as well as visits to 
other districts, to explain to Helmand citizens the 
upcoming UK deployment and what it would mean. 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Construction began in January 2006. 
Since the UK PRT is also the location of the UK task 
force assigned to Helmand province, this required an 
expansion of camp facilities.  As a result, one wall 
was pushed out to accommodate numerous permanent 
tents, including quarters for soldiers, offices for 
the task force, a new dining tent, and an ablutions 
block.  The camp will accommodate about 400 
personnel when all elements are in place. 
 
-------------------- 
A DIFFERENT APPROACH 
-------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  The UK emphasis will be on enhancing 
security and security/justice sector reform, 
capacity building of government entities, and 
economic and social development.   A significant 
difference is the expanded presence, both civilian 
and military.  When complete, the UK civilian 
component will consist of about 15 officials, 
including two Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) 
personnel, a Department for International 
Development (DFID) representative, and various 
contract advisors for police, justice, 
counternarcotics, and governance.  There is also a 
fulltime UK contract advisor working with Helmand 
Governor Daud.  The UK civilian component also 
includes a security team and armored vehicles.  A 
senior FCO official based in Kandahar Air Field will 
also cover the PRT on a part-time basis. 
 
¶10.  (SBU)  On the military side, the UK deployment 
will include about 3,300 troops.  About 2,000 will 
 
KABUL 00002021  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
be in Helmand fulltime, at a new base being 
constructed in the desert, about two hours northwest 
of Lashkar Gah.  An ANA brigade will be located 
adjacent to the UK troops.  The PRT itself will have 
a maneuver company, supporting PRT activities and 
enhancing security in the Lashkar Gah area.  In 
addition, the UK plans to increase liaison with the 
local population through joint foot patrols and 
multi-day visits to outlying districts.  All these 
activities will be conducted jointly with the Afghan 
National Army, Afghan National Police, or both, 
according to UK PRT officials. 
 
¶11.  (SBU)  Development will also be approached 
somewhat differently.  There is no UK equivalent to 
the Commanders Emergency Response Program.  There 
is a quick impact program run jointly by the 
military, FCO and DFID; however, most development 
activities will be administered by DFID and much of 
h of 
that will flow through government ministries and 
national programs.  DFID also plans to support the 
establishment of a fully representative provincial 
development committee.  All activities will be 
overseen by the sub-national government. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶12.  (SBU)  The relationship between the U.S. PRT 
and its host counterparts was very positive.  In 
general, signs point to a similar relationship with 
the UK PRT.  However, the UK will be operating in a 
different environment.  While citizens are pleased 
with the idea that the large UK military deployment 
will enhance security, we have long been expecting 
an uptick in the level of violence this 
spring/summer in the south, but police and ANA 
redeployment and the substantial increase in British 
strength should make significant gains possible in 
Helmands security. Quick impact projects may also 
play a key role in maintaining development momentum 
until longer term projects are implemented.  Poppy 
eradication may also have some impact on 
stabilization.  Finally, there is the factor of the 
UKs imperialist past in Afghanistan  three 
invasions that are still taught in Afghan schools. 
All these elements point to a sizeable challenge for 
the UK PRT and the accompanying military deployment. 
¶13.  Embassy Comment:  It is true that Afghans have 
a long memory for history, and a few Afghans even 
comment on the (unfortunate) British colonial 
history.  In general, however, the great majority of 
Afghans understand and support the modern-day 
British role here.
