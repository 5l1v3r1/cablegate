(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) From August 8-15, 2007, 16 security officials were wounded, 
including one in a firefight with PKK terrorists.  The remaining 15 
were wounded in landmine explosions. 
 
¶3. (U) From August 8-15, 2007, one PKK terrorist was killed, ten 
were captured, and one surrendered. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported one clash between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in southeastern Turkey during the reporting 
period.  Security forces unearthed at least ten PKK shelters/caves 
and seized booby-trapped land mines; other explosives, including A-4 
and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; hand grenades; pistols; 
night vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) On August 10, a civilian was injured when a mine exploded on 
a road in Hakkari Province. 
 
¶6. (U) On August 13, PKK set a minibus on fire at a private rock 
mine in Lice, Diyarbakir Province, and took away the cell phones of 
workers. 
 
¶7. (U) On August 13, the PKK set three privately-owned roadworking 
machines on fire at a road construction site near Refahiye, Erzincan 
Province. 
 
¶8. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
