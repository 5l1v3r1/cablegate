Gojlo said that MFA Undersecretary Ryszard Schnepf would head 
the Polish Delegation to the May 29 International Compact 
with Iraq (ICI) Ministerial Meeting in Stockholm, though he 
noted an official announcement had not yet been made.  In

was still working on its vision for the ICI Ministerial and 
could not disclose anything yet regarding topics such as 
bilateral agreements on debt reduction, pledges for possible 
financial or technical assistance, or showing support through 
other means.  Gojlo did state that Poland had recently 
provided medical treatment for three Iraqi children for 
war-related afflictions, and had contributed foreign aid to 
Iraq, though he did not have figures.

demarche to Katarzyna Czerniecka and Ilona Korchut of the
