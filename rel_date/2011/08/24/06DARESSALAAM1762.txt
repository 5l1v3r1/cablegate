CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION 
 
REF: STATE 178365 
 
¶1. (U) Suleman Saleh, Assistant Director for Multilateral 
Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, promised to 
determine the status of Tanzania's legislation on Chemical 
Weapons and inform the Embassy about the legislation's status 
by November 6.  With the upcoming Eleventh Session of the 
Chemical Weapons Conference in December, Poloff emphasized 
the need for Tanzania to move swiftly on the draft 
legislation to ensure compliance with its Article VII 
obligations. 
 
¶2.  (U) Regarding the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), 
Saleh was unsure why Tanzania was not yet a State Party but 
promised to follow-up with the Ministry of Defense to 
ascertain why.  He thanked Poloff for the invitation to 
observe the Sixth Review Conference of BWC States Parties in 
Geneva and the offer for technical assistance to enable new 
States Parties to meet the BWC's requirements on domestic 
implementation.
