SUBJECT: Kalvitis officially resigns as Latvian PM; Lavrov invited 
 
¶1. On December 5, Latvian PM Aigars Kalvitis submitted his 
resignation to President Zatlers, as he pledged last month.  Under 
the Latvian constitution, the resignation also covers all ministers 
and the government goes in to caretaker mode until the Saeima 
(parliament) approves a new government.  Kalvitis is the longest 
continually serving PM since the restoration of independence in 
¶1991. 
 
¶2. President Zatlers will name his choice to form the next 
government.  This announcement is expected the week of December 10. 
The only official candidate at this point is New Era MEP (and former 
Finance Minister) Valdis Dombrovskis.  (We will report more on the 
selection process in coming days). 
 
¶3. In one of its last official acts before resigning, the government 
announced that it had invited Russian FM Lavrov to visit Riga 
December 18.  The main purpose of the visit would be the exchange 
instruments of ratification on the Latvia - Russia border treaty.
