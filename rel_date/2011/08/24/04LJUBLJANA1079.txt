SUBJECT: SLOVENIA ON OSCE ELECTION OBSERVERS FOR IRAQ 
 
REF: SECSTATE 252711 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Pol/Econ chief raised the points in reftel with 
Blanka Jamnisek of the OSCE task force.  Though points had 
been provided in advance of the meeting, Jamnisek apologized 
for being unprepared to respond to the demarche. In addition 
to preparing for the OSCE ministerial this weekend, the 
Slovene MFA is preparing for the return of Dimitrij Rupel as 
Foreign Minister on Friday. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  With some prodding, Jamnisek allowed that if there 
were a consensus behind the idea of OSCE election observers 
in Iraq, as CiO, Slovenia would be prepared to see it 
implemented.  She was not able to offer a GOS opinion on the 
plan, however. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  In this conversation, as in many previous 
discussions, Jamnisek (and her colleagues) expressed the view 
that Slovenia would be taking on the role of "mediator" in 
the OSCE.  While the Task Force has described several 
initiatives it plans to introduce as CiO, it has been much 
less forthcoming with clear support or lack of support for 
specific proposals.  Perhaps with the arrival of Rupel at the 
end of this week, and thus the end of uncertainty about 
leadership of the MFA, Jamnisek and colleagues will be able 
to sharpen their views on OSCE issues and provide leadership 
as well.  End Comment.
