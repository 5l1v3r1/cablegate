¶3. The Export Control Team initiated contact with Oleg Titov, 
Director of Ton Ltd, in September 2008, shortly after receiving the 
PSV cable seeking a meeting to conduct the PSV.  Titov was advised 
at that time of the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and 
SecurityQs regulations regarding the importation of sensitive U.S. 
commodities.  However, Titov proceeded to stall and ignore the ECOQs 
repeated requests for a meeting.  Between September and December

occasions.  Each time Titov refused to arrange a time and place for 
the EUC.

number for his colleague, Arthur (LNU), in Sochi who is alleged to 
have the subject reftel commodity.  LES Shipitsina contacted Arthur 
(LNU), who also refused to meet with Export Control team, stating 
that he didnQt see any reason for the meeting. 
 
¶5. Recommendations: Post cannot/cannot recommend Ton Ltd as a 
reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
