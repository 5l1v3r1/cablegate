UNSCR 1718 
 
REF: A. STATE 179472 
 
     ¶B. ANKARA 6385 
 
¶1.  Post received a formal reply to ref a letter from U/S 
Joseph to MFA Deputy U/S for Security Affairs Rafet Akgunay 
on November 28. Original of the reply letter will be 
forwarded via diplomatic pouch.  Text of reply follows. 
 
¶2. Begin Text: 
 
Dear Ambassador Joseph, 
 
I have received your letter of November 2006 concerning the 
implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1718.  I 
would like to take this opportunity to outline Turkey's 
perspective on this issue. 
 
We believe that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
is one of the major threats to global peace and stability, 
and that any development in this field in any region will 
have repercussions on the global scale. 
 
In this regard, Turkey is following the developments in North 
Korea with great concern. We consider that the conducting of 
a nuclear test by North Korea on October 9 is a deliberate 
defiance of the explicit warning conveyed by the UN Security 
Council Presidency on behalf of the international community. 
The test posed a serious threat to peace and stability in 
East Asia and beyond.  We are also concerned that it will 
have a negative impact on global nuclear disarmament efforts. 
 
It is our desire to see North Korea refrain from additional 
action that would further aggravate peace and security in the 
region, assume once again its commitments on nuclear 
non-proliferation and resume dialogue with the international 
community for a full settlement of the nuclear issue. 
 
ANKARA 00006522  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
The crisis emanating from North Korea's nuclear program could 
best be addressed by engaging North Korea in a process of 
dialogue and encouraging it to act as a responsible member of 
the international community.  We hope that the Six Party 
Talks, to which North Korea recently announced its intention 
to return, will contribute to the quest for a peaceful 
solution.  It is in this light that we welcome the Resolution 
1718 and the legal process to translate the operative 
sections of the said Resolution into guidelines for 
implementation for our authorities has already started. 
 
Turkey, as a partner in the Proliferation Security 
Initiative, believes in the essential value of international 
cooperation to cope with the challenge presented by the 
proliferation of WMD and is ready to take part in efforts to 
reduce this threat.  In that respect, we are ready to hear 
the views of the United States on further initiatives for 
mechanisms such as those related to information sharing and 
regional radiation detection architecture, as mentioned in 
your letter. 
 
I am ready to remain in touch and fully cooperate with you on 
this matter as before. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Rafet Akgunay 
Deputy Undersecretary
