¶1.  (SBU) AMBASSADOR NIGRO MET WITH EU COMMISSION CHIEF GILLES 
DESESQUELLES AUGUST 11. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) THE KEY POINTS OF THE DISCUSSION WERE: 
 
------------- 
ON ELECTIONS: 
------------- 
 
-- DESESQUELLES IS SATIFIED THAT THE NEWLY-NAMED HEAD OF THE 
INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTION COMMITTEE (CENI), MR. NGARMADJAL GAMI, 
ALTHOUGH WITHOUT TECHNICAL BACKGROUND OR EXPERTISE IN ELECTIONS PER 
SE, COULD MAKE A "GOOD CENI PRESIDENT" BECAUSE OF HIS GENERAL 
POLITICAL INSTINCTS AND REPUTATION FOR FAIR-DEALING. 
 
-- DESESQUELLES IS ALSO SATIFIED IN GENERAL WITH THE OVERALL MAKEUP 
OF THE CENI. 
 
-- DESESQUELLES BELIEVES THAT THE CENI SHOULD SET A TENTATIVE 
ELECTION DATE FOR THE LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AND WORK 
BACKWARDS FROM THERE IN PLANNING FOR AN ELECTORAL CENSUS AND OTHER 
ARRANGEMENTS. 
 
-- DESEQUELLES THINKS THAT THE ELECTIONS COULD BE HELD IN 
MARCH-APRIL 2010. 
 
-- DESESQUELLES CONFIRMED THAT THE ELECTORAL REFORM COMMITTEE WOULD 
CONTINUE TO FUNCTION THROUGH THE 2010 ELECTIONS, COMPLEMENTING THE 
WORK OF THE CENI. 
 
-- DESESQUELLES AND AMBASSADOR AGREED TO URGE BOTH THE CENI AND THE 
ELECTORAL REFORM COMMITTEE TO HAVE FREQUENT CONTACT WITH EMBASSIES 
AS WELL AS CHADIAN NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE CHADIAN PUBLIC. 
 
-- DESESQUELLES AND AMBASSADOR AGREED TO COORDINATE EU ELECTION 
EFFORTS WITH U.S. EFFORTS, INCLUDING ON OBERVERS AND MONITORS. 
 
---------------------------- 
ON PUBLIC REVENUE MANAGEMENT 
---------------------------- 
 
-- DESESQUELLES SAID THAT HIS MISSION WAS EXPANDING, WITH A "PUBLIC 
REVENUE MANAGEMENT OFFICE" ALREADY UP AND RUNNING AND PLANNING FOR A 
"POLITICAL OFFICE" ADVANCED. 
 
-- DESESQUELLES AND AMBASSADOR AGREED TO COORDINATE EU AND U.S. 
EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE CHAD GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS 
PUBLIC REVENUES RESPONSIBLY.
