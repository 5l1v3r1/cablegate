SUBJECT:  EXBS: RUSSIA ADVISOR MONTHLY REPORTING CABLE - NOVEMBER 
2009 
 
¶1.  Begin summary: BROAD ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ADVISORS AND AGENCY 
MANAGERS: By mutual agreement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP)and the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. will postpone until 
at least March 2010 an International Visitors Program (IVP)requested 
by a new Russian federal agency, Rosgranitsa, to US ports of entry. 
Schedule conflicts and the holiday season were the reasons for the 
postponement.  Rosgranitsa is charged with ensuring security of 
facilities and IT infrastructure at ports of entry.  EXBS is working 
with CBP and the Russian Embassy to develop this visit.  Planning 
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proceeds on the reinstituted 
Program Review and additional Export Licensing Exchange scheduled 
for the first week of February in Washington.  EXBS provided 
thoughtful input to the QDDR process and also the Performance Plan 
and Report for 2009, coordinated at Post by USAID.  EXBS is 
gathering data on training conducted through the program for the 
past 5 years at the request of UGA/CITS, which is doing an 
assessment of the Russian export controls system.  Assistant 
participated in EXBS LES Conference November 17-19 in Germany.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2.  Completed Actions for Reporting Period. 
 
¶A.  Site Assessments and Meetings During the Reporting Period. 
 
i.  November 9 - EXBS Assistant met with Rosgranitsa development 
department to discuss general areas for possible cooperation beyond 
IVP in spring 2010 (due to last-minute, unexpected tightening of the 
rules regarding prior notification of foreigner visits, the Advisor 
could not attend this meeting, which was scheduled just before key 
Rosgranitsa officials left for an extended business trip).  The 
meeting was cordial, with Rosgranitsa expressing interest in further 
technical cooperation, but offering no specific areas of interest. 
Both sides agreed to reconnect in early 2010. 
 
ii.  November 12 - EXBS Advisor participated in USAID-coordinated 
Assistance Working Group meeting chaired by the DCM.  EXBS was among 
several funders that provided input to a draft cable that attempts 
to lay out the strategic direction of foreign assistance programs in 
Russia, suggests new and innovative tactics, and identifies funding 
gaps.  The cable is aligned with the approach of EXBS Russia over 
the past year, which envisions Russia as an important strategic 
partner in the nonproliferation effort, as opposed to an aid 
recipient. 
 
iii.  November 30 - At Ambassador Beyrle's request, EXBS wrote a 
memorandum reporting on the US Government's review of the Export 
Administration Act (EAA).  Special thanks are extended to the 
Foreign Commercial Service and also the Economic Section for their 
thoughtful inputs. 
 
¶B.  Training Conducted During Reporting Period. 
 
i.  No EXBS-funded training was conducted during this reporting 
period. 
 
¶C.  Equipment Delivered During Reporting Period. 
 
i.  The EXBS Russia program does not distribute equipment. 
 
¶3. Imminent Training or Equipment Status Update 
 
i.  EXBS continues to work with CBP and Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE)on an IVP requested by the Central Region (Moscow) 
Customs Administration scheduled for December 12-20.  The delegation 
will visit ports of entry in Southern California, including Los 
Angeles (Long Beach) and San Diego to observe procedures and 
technologies for processing passenger and cargo traffic.  Then they 
will travel to Washington for introductory meetings with officials 
of CBP and ICE, as well as visit Dulles Airport's cargo processing 
center. 
 
¶4.  Significant Developments in Export Controls, Nonproliferation, 
or Related Border Security 
 
i.  On November 27, Russia signed an agreement to form a customs 
union with Kazakhstan and Belarus.  The union will take effect on 
January 1, with the three countries using the same foreign trade 
tariffs and rules with one another, though it will likely take 
another six months for all tariffs to be synchronized.  The leaders 
 
 
of the three countries hailed the accord as a major step forward, 
while some analysts expressing skepticism about the pact's ability 
to significantly boost trade along the already-transparent borders. 
 
¶5.  Country Plans and Other Assistance 
 
i.  Received approval from ISN/ECC for FY08, FY09, and FY10 Program 
Plan.  Plan has been reviewed and approved by USG agencies.  EXBS 
will submit an abstract of the programs in advance of its meeting 
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 8.  As the lead 
agency, MFA has previously given broad approval to our program 
ideas.  In addition to receiving final stakeholder approval for the 
Program Plan, the purpose of this meeting will be to continue to 
move forward arrangements for the reinstituted Program Review and 
additional Export Licensing Exchange scheduled for the first week of 
February in Washington.
