SUBJECT: GOI ANNOUNCES SENTENCE CUTS FOR PRISONERS, 
INCLUDING CONVICTED TERRORISTS 
 
REF: 07 JAKARTA 2263 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The GOI granted sentence reductions of up 
to six months to tens of thousands of inmates on Indonesian 
Independence Day, August 17.  Although seven convicted 
terrorists received sentences cuts ranging from two to six 
months, only one will now be eligible for release.  A 2006 
regulation allowed for the delay of eligibility for 
remissions for those convicted of certain types of crimes, 
including terrorism, but in 2008 no terrorists were given the 
automatic sentence cuts.  Those receiving reduced sentences 
this year met minimum criteria and were given remissions for 
good behavior.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) THOUSANDS RECEIVE REMISSION:  Minister of Law and 
Human Rights Andi Mattalatta granted sentence reductions of 
up to six months to almost 60,000 of the country's prisoners 
on Indonesian Independence Day, August 17.  Approximately 
5,000 inmates will be released in the coming days because the 
remissions will cut the remainder of their sentences. 
According to a Ministry statement, there are approximately 
141,000 inmates across the country, but prison capacity is 
only 89,000 inmates.  Many observers note that the annual day 
and Idul Fitri remissions help reduce prison overcrowding. 
 
¶3. (SBU) TERRORISTS EFFECTED:  According to the Ministry of 
Law and Human Rights, seven convicted terrorists affiliated 
with Islamic radical groups, including Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), 
are among this group.  In his remarks, Mattalatta said that 
the terrorists receiving remissions had already served a 
third of their sentence and had exhibited good behavior in 
prison.  The seven were: 
 
-- Ahmad Rafiq Ridho aka Ali Zein aka Abu Husna Fuad Baraja, 
a member of JI who was captured in 2005 and sentenced to 
seven years in prison, received a two-month remission of his 
sentence. 
 
-- Hasanuddin, who was arrested in 2005 for his involvement 
in the Poso school-girl killings and sentenced to 20 years in 
prison, received a five-month remission of his sentence. 
 
-- Lili K Purnomo, who was arrested in 2005 for his 
involvement in the Poso school-girl killings and sentenced to 
14 years in prison, received a four-month remission of his 
sentence. 
 
-- Ali Masykur Abdul Kadir, who was involved in the Bali I 
bombing in 2002 and sentenced to 15 years in prison, received 
a six-month remission of his sentence. 
 
-- Syaiful Bahri, who was involved in the Australian Embassy 
bombing in 2004 and sentenced to 10 years in prison, received 
a five-month remission of his sentence. 
 
--Ismail (no alias was provided so his involvement in 
terrorist activities is not clear) received a five-month 
remission of his sentence. 
 
--Arifin aka Apin, who was convicted of texting a bomb threat 
in 2007 to 26 people, received a "freedom" remission because 
he had less than six months left on his sentence. 
 
¶4. (U) BACKGROUND:  A YEARLY RITUAL: The Minister of Law and 
Human Rights grants sentence reductions to thousands of 
Indonesian inmates each year on August 17, and again on Idul 
Fitri (for Muslims) and Christmas (for Christians).  This 
action is mandated by Presidential Decree 69 of 1999, Law 12 
of 1995 and other regulations.  To be eligible for a 
remission, prisoners must be serving more than a six-month 
sentence, must not be sentenced to death or to life 
imprisonment and must have exhausted all appeals.  Prison 
wardens submit for consideration the names of all convicts 
who have shown good behavior during their incarceration. 
Submission recommendations pass from the prison warden to the 
head of the prison system to the Minister of Law and Human 
Rights.  Traditionally, the Minister has granted the sentence 
reduction to all the names he receives (see reftel). 
 
¶5. (U) In July 2006, the GOI drafted Governmental Regulation 
28, which would delay remission eligibility to those 
convicted of designated crimes such as terrorism, drug 
 
JAKARTA 00001358  002 OF 002 
 
 
trafficking, corruption and gross human rights violations. 
The regulation stipulates that individuals convicted of any 
of these crimes are not eligible for remission until they 
have completed at least one-third of their original sentence. 
 This regulation was implemented for the first time in 2008, 
when no convicted terrorist received a sentence cut. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The 2009 annual day remissions demonstrated a 
selective use of the 2006 regulation.  The sentence 
reductions of the seven terrorists listed above were not 
automatic and other suggested terrorist remissions were 
rejected.  For example, eight convicted terrorists in Central 
Java's Sragen penitentiary were recommended for the annual 
remissions list, and the GOI rejected that recommendation.
