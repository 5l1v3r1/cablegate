SUBJECT: VOTER REGISTRATION SECURITY PLAN EMERGES 
 
REF: KABUL 1701 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Independent Electoral Commission's security 
advisor, a seconded Canadian military officer, presented his 
voter registration security plan (emailed to SCA/A) to the 
elections security working group on July 17.  It includes a 
threat assessment, spells out the roles of the Ministry of 
Interior (MOI), Ministry of Defense (MOD), National 
Directorate for Security (NDS), and ISAF, and addresses 
inter-agency coordination and communications. The plan 
recommends a "voter registration security center" be located 
at the National Police Coordination Center. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Under the plan, the Ministry of Interior is the 
lead agency for voter registration security.  IROA agencies 
and ISAF representatives agree MOD will back up MOI, NDS will 
provide intelligence support, and ISAF will offer security 
and logistics support "in extremis."  MOI representatives 
have repeatedly said the ANSF will re-deploy forces from 
other areas to support registration as needed.  The MOI will 
present its elaboration of the voter registration security 
plan to the Security Operations Group (SOG) on July 19, and 
stage a "command post exercise" (without troop movements) in 
September. The MOD will brief the SOG August 2 on the Afghan 
National Army's supporting role. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Relations between the MOI and MOD on elections 
security and other issues are not always cordial.  MOD 
representatives sometimes bristle at perceived MOI 
high-handedness in ordering the disposition of MOD assets. 
The MOD's August 2 SOG presentation will give us an 
indication of the two ministries' willingness to cooperate on 
securing the autumn voter registration.
