PROTOCOLS FOR DISTRICT SHURA APPROVAL 
 
REF: 06 KABUL 5638 
 
KABUL 00000236  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Helmand Governor Wafa has commenced his 
outreach to tribal leaders through a series of meetings with 
district shuras.  In each meeting, Wafa has presented his 
"protocols," which are conditions the shura must accept 
before the Governor will give his approval and support.  The 
conditions generally require the shura to recognize central 
government authority, support government and coalition 
security forces, support reconstruction and development, and 
oppose anti-government forces.  Wafa has met with at least 
five shuras so far and reports favorable reactions, with the 
Naw Zad shura signing a copy of the protocols.  The effort to 
have a systematic approach with a core focus on asserting 
central GOA authority is one we support.  The Musa Qala shura 
denied the Governor's claim that it accepted the protocols 
but is giving the agreement further consideration. 
Intransigence by the Musa Qala shura could pose one of the 
first tests for the new Governor.  Nevertheless, Wafa's 
approach is cutting off the previous risk that the Musa Qala 
precedent would spread and create broad swaths of territory 
closed to ISAF and ANSF.  The trend is positive.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Governor Wafa has commenced his tribal outreach in 
Helmand, for which he received mixed reviews during his 
tenures in Kunar and Paktia provinces.  Following a 
provincial jirga on January 10, during which he exhorted the 
hundreds assembled to reject foreign fighters and accept 
government authority, Wafa met separately with shuras from 
the districts of Naw Zad, Washir, Musa Qala, Garmsir and Nad 
Ali.  He plans to meet with shuras from all thirteen 
districts in Helmand. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In each meeting, Wafa presented to the elders a 
list of requirements (see paragraph 8) and described the 
items listed as "protocols," rather than a proposed 
agreement.  He insisted that the list consists of conditions 
for the shuras to meet with no corresponding obligations 
imposed on the government.  Wafa does make one concession -- 
permitting the shura to appoint the district head -- though 
he retains the power to appoint a head if he deems the 
shura,s appointee unqualified.  Wafa expects, or rather, 
demands that the shura accept and abide by the list as a 
condition for enjoying his recognition and cooperation.  He 
feels that he has a mandate from Kabul to pursue these 
protocols. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to Wafa, the Naw Zad shura has accepted 
the conditions and signed a copy to demonstrate this.  The 
shuras of Washir and Nad Ali, Wafa claimed, reacted favorably 
but have not formally accepted.  He also claimed that the 
Sangin shura reacted positively, but he assessed the elders 
in attendance were lacking sufficient influence in the 
district to guarantee compliance, and he told them to return 
with a stronger shura. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Wafa asked the Musa Qala shura to consider the 
protocols and claimed that the shura later accepted them.  In 
a meeting with members of the PRT, the shura denied that they 
had accepted the protocols.  The shura head asserted that it 
already had an agreement with the government.  However, the 
shura agreed to raise the matter with others in the district. 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The new Governor has wasted little time 
in reaching out to the tribal leaders and has staked out a 
strong position on the centrality of the government in 
provincial affairs.  He says this is non-negotiable.  The 
generally favorable reaction he reports is therefore a 
positive sign.  Expectations for full delivery on the 
protocols should be kept modest, however, as the ability of 
district shuras to adhere to or deliver on a number of 
provisions, at least in the short term, is limited.  It is 
not entirely clear why a shura would accept the protocols, 
given that nearly all obligations fall on the shura.  The 
 
KABUL 00000236  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
list might be attractive simply because the government is 
turning to the shura for guarantees, a move which could 
increase their influence and possibly access to resources. 
Being able to appoint a district head could make that office 
more answerable to the shura and more responsive to the 
community at large. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) COMMENT continued: Musa Qala-type agreements, which 
limit the government's influence and presence, no longer 
appears to be an option available to the districts.  Still 
unclear is the effect of the protocols on the Musa Qala 
agreement.  If acceptance of the protocols is not taken as 
negation of the Musa Qala agreement, then it could constitute 
an amendment that strengthens the government's position, 
something most shura members likely would not wantQalthough 
it remains to be seen what the district's "second shura" 
decides (REFTEL)).  The shura's intransigence could present 
one of the first real tests for the new Governor.  END
