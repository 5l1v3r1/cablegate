¶1.  (SBU) Format is keyed to reftel. 
 
¶A.  Attendance of the Head of State 
 
-- Name and title: Joao Bernardo "Nino" Vieira, President of 
the Republic of Guinea-Bissau 
 
-- Arrival and departure dates to and from New York and other 
U.S. locations, and whether the Head of State will be present 
for the General Debate:  President Vieira will travel to New 
York but does not yet know travel dates.

travel with her spouse. 
 
-- Portuguese interpretation will be required. 
 
¶B.  Attendance of the Head of Government 
 
-- Aristides Gomes, the Prime Minister has no plans as yet to 
attend UNGA. 
 
¶C.  Attendance of the Foreign Minister 
 
-- Antonio Isaac Monteiro, Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
International Cooperation and Communities, will travel to New 
York prior to President Vieira.  The Foreign Minister does 
not yet have fixed travel plans, but tentatively will depart 
Bissau on September 14 and arrive in New York the following 
day. 
 
-- Interpretation would not be required. 
 
¶D.  Attendance of other VIPs

¶E.  Attendance of the Foreign Ministry official responsible 
for IO affairs 
 
-- No information about other Foreign Ministry attendance is 
available at this time. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The presence of ForMin Monteiro in the United 
States would be a good opportunity to sign the tripartite 
agreement between the Governments of Guinea-Bissau, Brazil 
and the United States.  An earlier attempt to schedule a 
signing ceremony in April with the Secretary was not possible 
because the Bissau-Guinean Embassy in Washington was not 
staffed.  Monteiro has expressed strong interest in signing 
an agreement.
