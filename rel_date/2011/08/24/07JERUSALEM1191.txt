REF: JERUSALEM 1186 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Interfactional violence continued in Gaza 
June 13, with at least 16 Palestinians killed since 1200 
local.  Most fighting involved Hamas 
military-wing/8Executive Force8 attacks against Palestinian 
security forces (PASF) installations and homes/offices of 
senior Fatah leaders and PASF commanders.  Shooting continues 
in Gaza City and central Gaza as of 1700 local.  Hamas 
reportedly destroyed a Preventive Security (PSO) base in Khan 
Yunis and took over a National Security Forces (NSF) position 
there.  Unknown gunmen shot and killed two local UNRWA staff 
in Gaza City mid-day on June 13.  UNRWA has temporarily 
suspended its operations in the Gaza Strip.  Both Hamas and 
Fatah forces have set up checkpoints in major cities and 
highways, but according to all reports, Hamas dominates most 
critical routes.  Fatah militants in Nablus and Ramallah 
kidnapped at least 13 Hamas members and are reportedly 
threatening to kill them in retaliation for deaths of Fatah 
members in Gaza.  End summary. 
 
Gaza City and North Gaza 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Local Gaza contacts report that Gaza City,s 
neighborhoods are nearly empty, except for gunmen, as of 1600 
on June 13 and that they are hearing regular automatic 
gunfire in most of the city,s neighborhoods.  They report 
that snipers and machine-gun teams occupy nearly all 
residential and commercial high-rise buildings and all 
structures near the main security square, where the al-Saraya 
NSF HQ is located.  Reports indicate that the majority of 
these gunmen are Hamas and some are Fatah.  NSF contacts 
report sporadic gunfire and Hamas probes against al-Saraya,s 
security positions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) General Intelligence (Mukhabarat) contacts report 
heavy fire on their HQ in al-Sudaniya, Gaza City as of 1600 
local on June 13. (Note: UNRWA, whose office is in 
al-Sudaniya, corroborates reports of major fighting around 
the Mukhabarat compound.  End note).  There is regular 
shooting (including sniper fire from nearby buildings) at and 
around the PSO,s HQ in Tal al-Hawa, Gaza City, but PASF 
contacts do not report indications of an imminent assault on 
the compound. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Hamas spokesmen accused Fatah militiamen of burning 
several houses and stores owned by Hamas members in Gaza City 
on June 13.  Hamas took over the al-Muqawsi residential 
tower, home to several senior Fatah/PASF leaders, mid-day on 
June 13, after heavy Hamas-NSF fighting that killed at least 
6 Palestinians.  UNRWA reports one of its Gaza City employees 
was shot and killed in a crossfire mid-day on June 13. 
(Note: another UNRWA employee was killed in similar 
circumstances in Khan Yunis, see para. 8.  End note).

Fail to Calm Violence 
--------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Demonstrators organized by MG Burhan Hamad (Egyptian 
GIS, security representative) and several civil society 
groups confronted armed gunmen in Gaza City,s streets, and 
in several cases were chased off by gunfire.  Gunmen shot and 
injured at least four demonstrators on the afternoon of June 
13 (several others were reportedly beaten).  Gunmen from 
Hamas and Fatah exchanged fire when demonstrators approached 
a contested area near the al-Muqawsi and al-Karamah towers.

and the PSO HQ in Dayr al-Balah starting o/a 1200 on June 13, 
but security contacts report that the NSF repelled the 
attackers and that fighting died down to sporadic shooting by 
¶1430.  One &Executive Force8 and one NSF soldier were 
killed and several from both sides injured in the attacks.

al-Maghazi Refugee Camp, but said the NSF drove off the Hamas 
attackers.
