SUBJECT: BIOTECH OPPONENTS MEETING WITH FRENCH MINISTRY, THREATEN 
MORE GM CROPS DESTRUCTIONS 
 
¶1. In mid July 2007, approximately 500 activists, led by Jose Bove, 
a noted anti-biotech activist, gathered in Brittany calling for the 
destruction of the entire GM corn crop in France before it 
pollinates.  On July 23rd, close to 150 activists blocked the Port 
of Saint Nazaire, denouncing the importation of GM soybeans from 
South America.  Mr. Bove only agreed to lift the blockade after the 
French Minister of State for Ecology, Sustainable Development and 
Sustainable Planning (MESDSP) agreed to a meeting.  Bove noted that 
this was the first time that "delinquents" (Mr. Bove has had five 
prosecutions and received two prison sentences for crop 
destructions) were officially received by government officials. 
(Comment:  Mr. Bove may have solicited the Ministry for Ecology, 
Sustainable Development and Sustainable Planning rather than the 
Ministry of Agriculture as he was more likely to find a sympathetic 
audience.  Ms. Kosciusco-Morizet, the Secretary for Ecology, has a 
very conservative approach to biotech, supporting only the pursuit 
of biotech research. End Comment) 
 
¶2. The delegation of 8 anti-biotech activists, led by Jose Bove, in 
a meeting in Paris on July 31st with Ms. Kosciusco-Morizet, 
reiterated their request for an immediate moratorium on GM crops and 
the destruction of the 20,000 hectares of MON 810 corn planted this 
year.  While Kosciusko-Morizet made no official comment on the 
outcome of the meeting, Mr. Bove, who also spoke by phone with 
Minister of Ecology and Sustainable Development, Jean-Louis Borloo, 
said that both Borloo and Kosciusko-Morizet are aware that GMOs may 
be a divisive issue at " Le Grenelle de l'Environnement" an 
environmental management conference being organized by the 
Government of France which will take place in the fall. 
 
¶3. The anti-biotech group, called Voluntary Reapers, warned that 
unless the French government takes a strong stand against GMOs in 
the near future, they will continue to mobilize their 6,500 members 
to destroy GM crops grown for research or commercial cultivation.
