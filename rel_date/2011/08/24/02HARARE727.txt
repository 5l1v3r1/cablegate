¶1.   UNDER HEADLINE "NEW POLITICAL CULTURE OVERDUE," 
   THE 
   GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" USED ITS 
   MARCH 20 EDITORIAL TO CALL ON THE TWO MAJOR 
   POLITICAL PARTIES - ZANU PF AND MDC - IN ZIMBABWE 
   TO CO-EXIST, SAYING THE PARTIES " HAVE TO LEARN TO 
   LIVE TOGETHER, ARGUE TOGETHER AND OPPOSE EACH OTHER 
   IN A WAY THAT BUILDS ZIMBABWE."  EXCERPTS: 
 
¶2.   ". . .ZIMBABWE IS LONG OVERDUE FOR A CHANGE IN THE 
   WAY IT REGARDS POLITICS.  OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THE 
   COUNTRY HAS LIVED WITH A TWO-PARTY SYSTEM.  YET THERE 
   ARE FAR TOO MANY REMNANTS OF A CULTURE WHERE THERE WAS 
   JUST ONE DOMINANT PARTY AND A BUNCH OF HAS-BEENS 
   PROVIDING A TRIVIAL OPPOSITION.  REGRETTABLY, THE 
   INHERITED SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT FROM THE COLONIAL DAYS 
   WAS ALSO BUILT AROUND THE IDEA OF A MONOLITHIC RULING 
   PARTY. . . 
 
   "THE FIRST CONCEPT WE NEED TO INTRODUCE INTO A NEW 
   POLITICAL CULTURE IS THAT THE OTHER PARTY IS NOT 
   THE ENEMY.  THE OTHER PARTY MIGHT BE WRONG, IT 
   MIGHT EVEN BE PIGHEADED, BUT IT IS STILL PART OF 
   ZIMBABWE AND HAS TO BE REGARDED AS SUCH.  PARTIES 
   CAN OPPOSE EACH OTHER, AND DO SO VIGOROUSLY, BUT 
   THEIR AIM SHOULD NOT BE TO DESTROY EACH OTHER.  THE 
   SECOND THING WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IS THAT THE DAYS OF 
   A MONOLITHIC PARTY ARE GONE, FOREVER. . . 
 
   "IN SHORT, TALKS BETWEEN ZANU PF AND THE MDC SHOULD 
   NOT DWELL TOO MUCH ON TRYING TO FIND COMMON GROUND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

   IN POLICY.  THEY DIFFER TOO MUCH.  ONE OR THE OTHER 
   WOULD HAVE TO SELL OUT IN ITS CORE BELIEFS.  BUT 
   PARTIES SHOULD HELP CREATE AND SUSTAIN A NEW 
   POLITICAL CULTURE THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE 
   REALITY OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE HAVE TWO LARGE, WELL- 
   SUPPORTED PARTIES LED BY THE ONLY TWO MEN EVER TO 
   WIN MORE THAN 1 MILLION VOTES IN A ZIMBABWEAN 
   ELECTION.  WE HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE TOGETHER, ARGUE 
   TOGETHER AND OPPOSE EACH OTHER IN A WAY THAT BUILDS 
   ZIMBABWE.  THAT IS THE CHALLENGE."
