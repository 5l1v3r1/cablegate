Main Stories:

Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam lead with news of the arrival of Romanian 
President Tiran Basisko on July 12 in Ramallah for the signing of an 
agreement between the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and 
Romania.  In a joint press conference, Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President Mahmud Abbas stated that Israel must accept the two-state 
solution and the complete cessation of settlement activities in 
order to resume negotiations with the Palestinians.  Abbas stated 
that Romania can play a vital role in solving the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and President Basisko pledged his 
country's continued support of the PA and the efforts to revive 
negotiations. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page coverage of Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's invitation to the Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Abbas to meet and discuss the mechanisms 
for achieving a "political and economic peace" between the PA and 
Israel.  Netanyahu is reported as stating that Israel has no reason 
not to meet with Abbas; furthermore, the core of the conflict is the 
failure of Palestinians to recognize Israel as a Jewish state. 
 
In a political cartoon related to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu's invitation to President Abbas (Al-Quds), Netanyahu is 
depicted underground in an unlit room in Beer Sheeva, seated at a 
table across from an empty chair, presumably awaiting Palestinian 
President Mahmud Abbas.  The cartoon, entitled "Beer Sheeva 
Negotiations!!" is an ironic comment on Netanyahu's desired location 
for negotiations with Abbas, implying that this is not a conducive 
environment for serious talks. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports on statements made by the EU's High 
Representative for Foreign Affairs, Javier Solana, in London on July 
11, in which he called on the UN Security Council to set a deadline 
by which a Palestinian State should be accepted as a full member of 
the UN, even if the Palestinians and Israelis do not reach an 
agreement.  The paper also reports that a senior aide to President 
Abbas, Nimer Hammad, welcomed Solana's statements and noted that the 
international community is committed to ending the Palestinian 
conflict. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports on Voice of Palestine's July 12 interview 
with the PLO's Chief Negotiator, Saeb Erekat, in which he stated 
that the Palestinians will reject any US-Israeli agreement that 
would allow Israel to continue even limited settlement construction 
in the West Bank. Al-Ayyam also reports comments by Erekat that US 
Special Envoy George Mitchell will begin a "new mission" in the 
region in ten days. 
 
Al-Quds reports on President Obama's July 12 interview with 
London-based Sky News, in which he expressed concern over Syria's 
policy towards its regional neighbors, and specifically, its support 
for Iran, Hamas, and Hizbullah. Obama stressed, though, that the US 
is committed to improving its relations with Syria, according to the 
report. 
 
All dailies report on Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's appointment of 
Dr. Ghassan Al-Khatib as Director of the new Information Office for 
the Palestinian Authority (PA), reporting to the Prime Minister. 
Dr. Al-Khatib is a former Minister of Planning.

Weekend Stories: 
-------------- 
Sunday July 12 
 
Al Quds, Al Ayyam, and Al Hayat Al Jadida report on claims that the 
U.S. has given Israel six months to respond to its demand of a 
complete freezing settlement construction freeze in the West Bank. 
These reports are based on statements made by France's Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Bernard Kouchner.  Kouchner had completed an 
official visit to Beirut, during which he informed his Lebanese 
counterparts that the U.S. had extended its deadline despite the 
fact that the U.S. will not sponsor the resumption of negotiations 
as long as settlement construction continues. 
 
Al Quds's front-page coverage includes the announcement by President 
Mahmud Abbas of his acceptance of any Egyptian proposal to achieve 
national reconciliation and to end the "siege" imposed upon the Gaza 
Strip.  Both Fatah and Hamas have expressed their support for 
Egypt's involvement in the national unity talks.  The paper also 
reports that the head of the Egyptian security delegation, Mohammad 
Ibrahim, is ready to submit a detailed report to Minister Omar 
Suleiman regarding his discussions with President Abbas and leaders 
of other Palestinian factions, with his recommendations on how to 
end the internal political conflict.  President Abbas is quoted as 
stating: "Egypt is the only country that knows how to manage the 
Arab-Israeli conflict."  President Abbas also stated that he 
believes Hamas leader Khaled Misha'al is moving towards a moderate 
position, and that his most recent speech was more moderate in its 
tone.  Abbas also added that Hamas does not reject peace. 
 
Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida both report on statements made by 
Ambassador Hisham Yousef, director of the Arab League Secretary 
General's office, that East Jerusalem is part of the territories of 
the Palestinian state.  Yousef commented on the efforts by Israel 
regarding the "so-called Holy Basin," which he described as a means 
of controlling the surroundings of the old City of Jerusalem and as 
"absolutely illegal." 
 
Saturday July 11 
 
Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida report on statements made by leaders 
of the G8 Summit reiterating their full support for an end to the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict based on the two-state solution.  The 
G8 called for the resumption of negotiations between Israel and the 
Palestinians, as well as the immediate opening of border crossings 
into Gaza in a manner that does not jeopardize the security of 
Israel. 
 
Al Quds, Al Ayyam, and Al Hayat Al Jadida report on anti-Wall 
protests organized in Ramallah and Bethlehem, which coincided with 
the fifth anniversary of the International Court of Justice's ruling 
on the illegitimacy of the Wall.  Israeli soldiers were called in to 
use force against protesters.  The protests resulted in a number of 
arrests and injuries. 
 
Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida report that according to the Israeli 
newspaper Yediot Ahranot, President Obama will convene a meeting 
with Jewish community leaders in the U.S. during which he will 
request their assistance in reaching out to Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu.  The newspaper also added that well-informed 
sources linked to the White House and Congress have described recent 
events between the White House and Netanyahu as a "crisis" and a 
"fire" which if not put out will negatively impact what remains of 
the special relationship between Israel and the U.S.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1) Samih Shabib, Al-Ayyam, "Settlements and the US Position" 
(07/13):  "The Palestinians still want to see a stronger stance from 
the U.S. and European countries regarding the settlements... Israel 
continues to work at high-speed to construct more settlements 
irregardless of the demands of the U.S. and the Europeans.  There is 
no serious pressure exerted on Israel... Should we expect that the 
U.S. will take serious steps in the near future that will impact the 
expansion of settlements?" 
 
2) Ghazi Hamad, Al-Quds independent daily, "How can we achieve a 
real victory over Israel?" (07/13): "How can we achieve victory over 
Israel under the current conflict? Victory will never be achieved 
given the current internal political division.  National unity 
should trump personal interests."
