¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of confirmed H1N1 infections in 
Germany increased by 503 new cases bringing the total as of 
August 13 to 11,103.  Consistent with previous reporting, the 
majority of new infections occurred abroad.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U)  At its August 12 press briefing, the National 
Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute 
(RKI) confirmed a total of 503 new (laboratory and non- 
laboratory) H1N1 cases in Germany over yesterday.  This 
increases the total number of H1N1 cases to 11,103.  New cases 
were distributed among the federal states as follows: Lower- 
Saxony (152), North Rhine-Westphalia (139), Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(67), Rhineland-Palatinate (63), Hesse (27), Brandenburg (17), 
Thuringia (12), Hamburg (11), Saxony (5), Bremen (5), Saxony- 
Anhalt (3) and Berlin (2). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, 331 of the 503 new cases are 
attributed to people returning from travel abroad.  New cases 
also include non-laboratory H1N1 cases from people who 
exhibited symptoms after being in contact with a laboratory 
confirmed infected person.  So far, all new cases are 
reportedly mild. 
 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the German state with 
the highest number of confirmed H1N1 cases with a total of 
4,015, followed by Lower-Saxony (2018) and Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(1081).  About 23 percent (2504) of all confirmed H1N1 
infections in Germany have resulted from domestic 
transmission.
