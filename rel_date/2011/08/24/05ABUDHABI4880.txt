SUBJECT: PREPARING FOR THE DECEMBER 4-5 KABUL CONFERENCE 
(REGIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION CONFERENCE) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 211164 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) On November 26, Econchief briefed MFA A/US for 
International Cooperation Mohammed Abduljaleel about the 
Kabul Conference.   Abduljaleel suggested that Econchief also 
brief MFA A/US for Political Affairs Tariq Al-Haidan as the 
person responsible for the conference.  On November 28, 
Econchief discussed the Kabul Conference with Al-Haidan, who 
said that he had just finished a meeting with the Afghan 
Ambassador on the conference.  Al-Haidan said that the UAE 
viewed regional economic cooperation as important and wanted 
to cooperate with its friends.  He noted that Afghanistan was 
facing a "new history."  It was rebuilding its 
infrastructure, finishing schools, and hopefully was 
beginning to benefit from the results.  Al-Haidan commented 
that the UAE and Afghanistan already were cooperating 
economically. He explained that the large Afghan population 
in the UAE ensured that trade relations between the two 
countries were strong, adding that the efficient UAE port and 
airport system also made it attractive to Afghan traders. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Al-Haidan said that the MFA had not yet decided who 
would represent the UAEG at the conference, adding that they 
had asked the offices of Deputy PM/Minstate for Foreign 
Affairs Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al-Nahyan and Foreign 
Minister Rashid Abdulla Al-Noaimi for a decision.  He 
promised to contact Econchief when he developed further 
information.
