Six-Party Heads of Delegation Meeting 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the July 12 regular MFA press briefing, spokesman Qin 
Gang announced that there will be a meeting between the 
Six-Party Heads of Delegation July 18-19 in Beijing.  He said 
that in such a complicated situation, which includes the 
issue of a long-term peace mechanism for Northeast Asia, all 
parties must work together through peaceful dialogue on an 
equal footing and that actions would be based on the 
principle of action-for-action and commitment-for-commitment, 
when asked what "the next stage" in the denuclearization of 
the Korean Peninsula might entail.  Asked about a possible 
meeting of the six parties' foreign ministers, Qin replied 
that various parties have made suggestions and China is open 
to such suggestions.  Qin said he has not heard anything 
about a meeting between the foreign ministers of the United 
States, China, the DPRK and the ROK.  UN resolutions relating 
to the DPRK are up to the consensus of the permanent members 
of the UN Security Council, the spokesman stated in response 
to a question on the lifting of sanctions on the DPRK. 
 
MFA Denies Orchestrated Missionary Expulsions 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. Asked about reports of a campaign to expel foreign 
missionaries in the lead up to the 2008 Olympics, the 
spokesman stated he had noticed the reports, consulted 
relevant departments in China and found that no such activity 
was underway. 
 
United States-Burma Meeting Constructive 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. At the request of the United States and Burma, China 
helped arrange a meeting in Beijing between representatives 
of the two countries, said Qin when asked for confirmation by 
a reporter.  China believes direct dialogue and exchange of 
views is constructive and helpful. 
 
IMF Head Should Consider Developing Nations 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. China is studying the EU's support of Strauss-Kahn to 
become the new IMF director, said Qin replying to media 
suggestion that the incoming director should hail from Asia. 
China believes the interests of developing countries' 
economic and financial issues should be considered when 
selecting a new director, Qin added.

¶6. The Governments of China and Niger are actively working to 
ensure the safe and early release of hostages, Qin said 
commenting on the kidnapping of an executive from a Chinese 
uranium mining company and the company's subsequent pullout 
from Niger.  Bilateral economic and trade cooperation are 
based on a policy of equality and mutual benefit, and support 
Niger's development, Qin stated.  He added that the Chinese 
Government supports Chinese enterprises in Africa.  The 
spokesman was not aware of the Israeli-run website

been blocked in China.
