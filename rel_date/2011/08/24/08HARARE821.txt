SUBJECT: SEED SHORTAGE ONE MORE THREAT TO MAIZE PRODUCTION 
IN ZIMBABWE

Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Zimbabwe is heading into the summer planting season 
about one third short of needed seed maize. The past year's 
seed maize crop was poor due to uneven rainfall and 
inadequate supply of inputs. In addition, price controls have 
deterred farmers from growing the crop and delivering it to 
the formal market. The private sector expects the government 
to fill the seed shortfall with market-priced imports that 
will invariably arrive too late.  Under these circumstances, 
expert opinion suggests the 2008/09 commercial maize harvest 
could be the smallest since independence.  Plant breeding 
expertise is nevertheless still strong and the backbone of 
Zimbabwe's beleaguered seed industry.  For their part, donors 
plan to assist more than 270,000 households with agricultural 
inputs this summer season. End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Shortfall in Seed Maize as Planting Season Approaches 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Zimbabwe has a shortfall of about 15,000 t of seed 
maize out of the 40,000 t needed to grow enough maize to meet 
domestic demand, according to Patrick Devenish, Group CEO of 
Zimbabwe's dominant and publicly quoted seed maize producer 
Seed Co Limited.  In a meeting with econoff on September 8, 
Devenish discounted figures provide by the GOZ at an August 
28 meeting of the FAO-led Agricultural Coordination Working 
Group.  At that meeting, the GOZ had announced that it needed 
50,000 t of seed maize and had 32,000 t available in imports, 
local production and carryover stock.  Stanley Kanembirira, 
Finance Manager of U.S.-owned Pioneer Hi-Bred Zimbabwe blamed 
the lower than expected yield of seed maize on very wet 
conditions during the planting season followed by low 
rainfall in February/March; incessant power cuts for the 
irrigated crop; late or non-receipt of fertilizer and 
chemicals; fuel shortages; non-availability of farm labor due 
to low wages; and less than anticipated subsidized funding 
from government. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Devenish added that price controls on seed maize 
were a major disincentive to growing the crop and to selling 
it to the seed houses. Seed Co estimated that its contracted 
growers had reaped 9,500 t of seed maize but would deliver 
only 4,600-6,000 t to the company; they were selling the rest 
from the farm gate or at local markets for human consumption. 
 Illustrative of the extreme price distortions caused by 
ill-conceived price controls, maize today is selling by the 
bucket at Harare's Mbare produce market for US$7.50-10 (60 
buckets to the MT) or US$450-600/t, while the recently raised 
controlled price of commercial maize is Z$4,500/MT (US$9 on 
the parallel market today) and of seed maize Z$20,000/t 
(roughly US$40).

Next Year's Maize Crop ) Possibly Smallest Since Independence

¶4. (SBU) Devenish predicted that next year's commercial maize 
crop would be the smallest since independence, barring 
perfect growing conditions.  He expected the government to 
awaken to the seed maize shortfall some time in November and 
place last-minute orders from Zambia at market prices.  The 
seed would invariably arrive too late for optimal 
early-December planting and high yield.  Nor had the 
government in the course of the year overcome any of the 
non-weather related constraints of the 2007/08 growing season 
noted by Kanembirira.  In addition, Devenish noted that yield 
also depended on who got the available seed--"master farmers" 
or marginal-yielding growers.  Without further comment he 
said General Solomon Mujuru had asked him that day to see to 
it that he got five tons of seed maize this year. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Dim Medium Term Outlook, as Well 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Devenish cautioned against dependence on seed maize 
from Zambian growers, as they were shifting out of the crop 
and into much more profitable back-to-back plantings of 
winter wheat and summer soy.  Also, he pointed out that, 
contrary to common belief, seed maize was not generic and 
could not be imported from just anywhere; it was bred for 
specific conditions. Devenish called Seed Co's position in 
Zimbabwe unsustainable.  The local operation produced half of 
the group's product by volume, but would contribute only 
US$100,000 in profit against US$5 million from the group's 
Zambian operation this year.  The backbone of Seed Co 
Zimbabwe was its world-renowned Rattray Arnold Research 
Station outside Harare.  If Seed Co began to lose the plant 
breeding staff at that facility, Devenish said he could no 
longer defend maintaining group headquarters in Zimbabwe. For 
now, the company was fighting skills flight by providing 
research staff frequent foreign-currency-paid training and 
instruction opportunities throughout Africa. 
 
----------------------- 
Donors Commit to Inputs 
----------------------- 
 
¶6. (U)  Although donors will not be able to overcome the 
effect of perverse incentives, they will provide assistance 
to a significant number of subsistence farmers.  According to 
the Food and Agriculture Organization, NGOs, through donor 
funding, have put in place plans to assist more than 270,000 
households (approximately 1.3 million people) in 41 districts 
with agricultural inputs in the 2008/9 summer season. 
207,000 households are targeted to receive seeds and/or 
fertilizers, 50,000 households will receive training and 
inputs for conservation agriculture, and 17,100 households 
will be assisted through seed fairs and input voucher 
programs.

¶7. (U) As the rainy season approaches, the country is 
woefully unprepared for the 2008/09 growing season. Any 
chance that Zimbabwe could generate a supply side response 
this season to a rapidly implemented shift in agricultural 
policy is slipping with every passing day of political 
stalemate.  End Comment.
