SUBJECT: FSC JANUARY 21: NEW ROUND, OLD AGENDA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The winter 2009 session opened with no 
surprises with many agenda items remaining from the autumn 
2008 round.  The new French chair proposed a straight forward 
work plan for 2009 that includes long-established topics: 
CSBMs, small arms (SALW) and conventional ammunition (SCA), 
the Code of Conduct, and UNSCR 1540. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The EU and others supported the work plan.  Russia, 
too, offered support, noting it wanted "serious dialogue" on 
security issues and an improved CSBM regime in Europe.  The 
U.S. offered support for addressing practical security 
concerns and implementation of CSBMs as well as continued 
efforts to implement UNSCR 1540 and prevent the proliferation 
of MANPADS. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ukraine reported Russia had exceeded certain 
bilaterally agreed arms limits pertaining to the Russian 
Black Sea Fleet stationed in Ukraine.  Russia denied this but 
promised to provide clarification.  End summary. 
 
FSC 2009 Work Plan 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) France (Lebedel) opened its chairmanship of the FSC 
winter 2009 session with a rapid review of the new year's 
work plan as agreed by the 2009 FSC chairs, including Georgia 
and the UK (FSC.INF/4/09).  Priorities include: 
 
-- intensified use of the Security Dialogue; 
 
-- continued implementation of existing OSCE documents in the 
political-military dimension (Vienna Document, SALW and 
conventional ammunition, the Code of Conduct) and the 
discussion of possible new initiatives (MC.DEC/11/08); and 
 
-- further work on UNSCR 1540 per the 2006 and 2008 decisions 
(FSC.DEC/10/06, MC.DEC/13/08). 
 
France and the other chairs also want to promote the "OSCE 
concept of cooperative security" and follow-up on 
implementation of the 2008 Helsinki Ministerial decision on a 
range of FSC issues besides SALW/SCA. 
 
¶5. (SBU) France confirmed that four FSC coordinators have 
been reconfirmed in their positions for 2009: Petersen 
(Denmark) for SCA; Hartnell (UK) for SALW; Eischer (Austria) 
for the Code of Conduct; and Schweizer (Germany) as chair of 
the Informal Group of Friends of SALW.  A coordinator is 
still needed for the 2009 Annual Security Review Conference. 
 
¶6. (SBU) France announced it had invited the Partners for 
Cooperation to attend and participate in the discussions of 
the FSC working groups; Partners already have a standing 
invitation to the FSC plenary sessions. 
 
Wide Support for Work Plan 
-------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Czech Republic (Pocuch), on behalf of the EU, 
Greece, the 2009 OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Switzerland, 
Finland, and others immediately expressed support for the 
French plans (FSC.DEL/3/09, FSC.DEL/4/09).  Pocuch pointed 
out that UNSCRs 1540 and 1810 were of particular relevance to 
regional organizations like the OSCE.  All urged other 
 
USOSCE 00000008  002 OF 003 
 
 
participating States to adopt quickly the draft update of the 
Code of Conduct questionnaire, still pending after over a 
year of negotiation. 
 
Russia's Priorities 
------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Russia (Ulyanov) welcomed Georgia to the Troika and 
praised the 2009 work plan as "sound, of high quality, and 
likely to help the FSC reach its full potential."  Ulyanov 
said Russia had two major priorities for the FSC in 2009: (1) 
serious dialogue on security issues and (2) improving the 
CSBM regime in Europe. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Georgia (Giorgadze) noted its alignment with the EU 
statement and pledged full support to the FSC Troika and 
efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of the Forum. 
 
U.S. Goals 
---------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) The U.S. (Neighbour) pledged support for practical, 
results-oriented initiatives in the working groups and use of 
the Security Dialogue to explore relevant issues.  The U.S. 
called for continued work on implementation of UNSCR 1540, 
including completion of the Best Practice Guide.  The U.S. is 
eager to engage on various aspects of cyber security and 
seeks support for continuing efforts by participating States 
and the Partners for Cooperation to counter the proliferation 
of MANPADS. 
 
French Defense White Paper and EU Security Strategy 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶11. (SBU) Michel Miraillet, director of strategic affairs at 
the French defense ministry described the impact of the 
recent French defense white paper on the chair's approach to 
European security issues: the EU and NATO are complementary 
and French commitments to the former cannot be separated from 
its restored role in the Alliance.  France will work with 
other Member States to implement the European Security 
Strategy, which includes combating terrorism, preventing the 
proliferation of WMD and conventional weapons, and nuclear 
and conventional disarmament. 
 
Ukraine Calls Russia Out on Black Sea Fleet 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) Ukraine (Herasymenko) called on Russia to reduce 
its "excess" holdings of certain weapons stationed on 
Ukrainian territory as part of the bilateral Black Sea Fleet 
stationing agreement (FSC.DEL/194/08).  Russia (Ulyanov) 
explained that the apparent excesses were due to an anomaly 
in the Vienna Document that reported certain Black Sea Fleet 
units actually in Russia as being in Ukraine.  Ulyanov said a 
fuller elaboration was forthcoming from Moscow. 
 
¶13. (SBU) The U.S. (Neighbour) said both interventions would 
be forwarded to Washington and urged all participating States 
to fulfill all their international obligations.  Privately, 
the Ukrainian delegation noted their appreciation to the U.S. 
for its intervention. 
The Treaty of Utrecht and All That 
---------------------------------- 
 
USOSCE 00000008  003 OF 003 
 
 
 
¶14. (SBU) Spain and the UK exchanged interventions noting 
their Vienna Document submissions at the Annual Exchange of 
Military Information in December 2008 were without prejudice 
to their territorial claims on Gibraltar. 
 
SALW and Conventional Ammunition Projects 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶15. (SBU) The FSC coordinator for SALW (Hartnell) gave an 
overview of ongoing or proposed projects in Tajikistan, 
Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Cyprus (FSC.DEL/2/09).  Hartnell 
reminded that the deadline for proposals in response to 
Cyprus's request for assistance in destroying MANPADS was 
January 21.  Proposals will be compiled by the CPC; an 
assessment visit is planned in February. 
 
¶16. (SBU) The FSC coordinator for stockpiles of conventional 
ammunition (Petersen) reported on projects in Georgia, 
Kyrgyzstan, Montenegro, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine 
(FSC.GAL/196/08).  He noted that continuation of the 
ammunition demilitarization project in Georgia would depend 
on the future of the OSCE presence there, "or that of other 
international organizations."  In his national capacity, 
Petersen announced Denmark was donating half a million euros 
to the melange project in Ukraine. 
 
Coming Attractions 
------------------ 
 
¶17. (SBU) France (Simonet) reminded delegations to submit 
nominations for speakers, coordinators, and rapporteurs for 
the Annual Implementation Assessment Meeting on March 3-4 and 
the special cyber security workshop on March 17-18.  A 
"coordination" meeting for the cyber workshop will be held on 
February 3. 
 
¶18. (SBU) Germany invited participating states to send 
high-ranking MFA and MOD officials to a seminar on 
"Conventional Arms Control and Disarmament in the Current 
Strategic Environment," to be held March 24-26 at RACVIAC in 
Zagreb, Croatia.  Deadline for applications to the German 
Foreign Office is February 20. 
 
Next Meeting 
------------ 
 
¶19. (SBU) The next meeting of the FSC, including working 
groups, will be on January 28 and will feature Peter Croll, 
director of the Bonn (Germany) International Center for 
Conversion, discussing non-proliferation and export controls 
in the Security Dialogue.
