THIS CABLE IS A CORRECTED VERSION OF BEIRUT 1008 (TEXT ADDED) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Beirut fully supports the FY10 section 1206 
proposal as submitted by the Office of Defense Cooperation 
ODC) Lebanon.  This proposal, which addresses Lebanese Armed 
Forces (LAF), special operations forces (SOF), 
counter-terrorism (CT) and weapons support, reinforces the 
mission's strategic goals of CT cooperation and 
military-to-military engagement with the LAF.  The proposal 
provides mobile, heavy weapons (MK-19 40mm grenade launchers 
and M2 .50 caliber machine guns) and organic indirect fire 
support (120mm mortars) to the LAF,s SOF regiments.  The 
inherent versatility of the weapons platoon as part of the 
SOF regiment makes it well-suited for use against 
asymmetrical threats during CT operations.  The release and 
employment of the equipment identified in this proposal will 
facilitate progress toward DoS, DoD and LAF shared goals. 
Post is not aware of any credible evidence of gross 
violations of human rights by the units who are proposed to 
receive assistance. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The LAF urgently requires assistance from the U.S. 
to improve its ability to conduct CT operations and secure 
its borders.  The equipment identified in this proposal is 
one step forward to increasing the LAF's capabilities and 
securing its place as the country's dominant provider of 
military power. 
 
¶3. (SBU) This Section 1206 program will help build the 
capacity of this partner nation's eligible forces to conduct 
CT operations by providing equipment to build their 
capability to provide indirect fire during CT operations, 
especially in urban areas such as Nahr al-Bared and other 
densely populated Palestinian refugee camps.  Acting on the 
proposal's requests will also provide the LAF increased urban 
warfare capabilities to combat Sunni extremist groups and 
Palestinian rejectionist groups which often use refugee camps 
as safe havens. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Indirect fire in future CT operations is an 
important application for LAF artillery.  However, the fire 
direction limitations of the LAF's artillery prevent its 
effective use in urban CT operations due to the potential for 
high levels of collateral damage.  Therefore, improved 
artillery targeting systems which offer the LAF the ability 
to identify and carry out high-precision fire are critical to 
avoiding civilian casualties and reducing risks to 
non-combatants.
