SUBJECT: CFE/JCG SEPTEMBER 16: RUSSIAN INSPECTION REFUSALS 
DEPLORED 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Turkey and the U.S. at the September 16 
Joint Consultative Group (JCG) announced that Russia had 
refused their requests for CFE inspections.  Germany, Greece, 
France, Romania, Italy, the UK, and the Netherlands regretted 
the Russian refusals, including an earlier refusal of 
Romania, and called on Russia to comply fully with its CFE 
obligations.  Germany announced its next "Berlin Seminar on 
Conventional Arms Control" will be held September 30 - 
October 1 and recommended canceling the September 30 JCG to 
accommodate delegates attending the seminar.  The U.S., 
Luxembourg, and the UK supported the German proposal.  The 
chair will return to the matter at the next meeting.  The JCG 
declined a request from the OSCE Communications Group to 
change the treaty-specified December 15 date for the Annual 
Exchange of Military Information.  End summary. 
 
Russian Refusals Reproached 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) At the September 16 JCG, Turkey (Gungen) announced 
it had notified Russia of its intent to conduct an inspection 
September 8-13 but Russia refused, citing its July 14, 2007 
memo on suspension of CFE implementation.  Turkey said its 
view of Russian suspension as described in its Note Verbale 
to the treaty registrar was still valid. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The U.S. (Neighbour) expressed full support for 
Turkey and Romania, who had been refused by Russia a week 
earlier, in their demands that Russia comply with its CFE 
obligations.  Neighbour announced Russia had also refused 
the U.S. September 11 inspection request.  A positive 
response from Russia, he added, would have been an important 
signal of Russia's willingness to abide by its treaty 
obligations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Germany (Richter) gave full support to its Allies. 
Richter noted, with regret, that, even after the crisis in 
Georgia, Russia was still not complying with CFE.  Continued 
compliance with the treaty, he said, was a cornerstone of 
European security.  Germany insists on full compliance from 
Russia because of the danger that other States might fail to 
comply fully; this would unavoidably lead to further erosion 
of the treaty.  Richter referred to the March 28 NAC 
statement as an "offer" to overcome the CFE crisis. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Greece (Sourani), referring to the Turkish and U.S. 
statements, fully supported the German position and noted 
with regret that nine months after Russia suspended its 
implementation there was still no resolution, which 
jeopardized the long-term viability of the treaty. 
 
¶6. (SBU) France, Romania, Italy, the UK, and the Netherlands 
also deplored the inspection refusals and called for Russia 
to return to full compliance. 
 
No Russian Response 
------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Russia (Mazur) did not respond. 
 
AEMI Date Change Rejected 
------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The chair, Poland, announced the new chair of the 
OSCE Communication Group (Sibbett) had requested concurrence 
of the JCG in scheduling the Annual Exchange of Military 
Information on December 12, instead of the treaty-specified 
date of December 15, to allow experts from capitals to avoid 
a weekend stay in Vienna after formatting their submissions 
during the automated data workshop scheduled for December 
10-12. 
 
¶9. (SBU) The U.S. (Neighbour) objected, explaining there was 
no compelling reason the workshop could not be held on 
December 15 and that it was for the Communications Group to 
coordinate its schedule based on the treaty-mandated date of 
December 15 for the actual exchange.  No delegation supported 
 
the December 12 date, although Germany said it could be 
"flexible" if there was a JCG decision to do so.  (Note:  The 
Communications Group, which met later on September 16, 
announced that the AEMI will be held on December 15, with the 
automated data workshop to be held December 11-15.  End note.) 
 
Germany Wants to Cancel September 30 JCG 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Germany (Richter) announced the next "Berlin 
Seminar on Conventional Arms Control" on CFE and Southeastern 
Europe to be held September 29 - October 1.  Richter proposed 
canceling the September 30 JCG meeting to accommodate 
delegates participating in the seminar.  The U.S., the UK, 
and Luxembourg supported the proposal, Neighbour noting that 
the JCG schedule for the autumn session (JCG.INF/23/08) was 
only indicative and the only firm dates on it were those for 
the opening and closing meetings of the session.  The chair 
agreed to return to the proposal at the next JCG meeting. 
 
Canada Plans Inspection in Georgia 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) Separately, Canada informed the U.S. delegation 
that it plans to request an inspection of Georgia.  Canada 
did not say when and which part of Georgia it has in mind. 
 
Next Meeting 
------------ 
 
¶12.  (U) The next meeting of the JCG will be on September 23, 
to be chaired by the Netherlands.
