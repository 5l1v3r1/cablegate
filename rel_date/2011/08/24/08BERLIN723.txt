(SBU) MFA Head of Unit for Civil Uses of Nuclear Energy and 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Dietrich Becker told Global Affairs 
Officer June 2 that Germany had decided to decline ref A 
invitation to present on Germany's preparation and lessons 
learned through hosting the 2006 World Cup.  Becker explained 
that Interior Ministry officials did not feel it was 
appropriate to give a presentation at the GI meeting on the 
comprehensive security strategy Germany developed for the 
World Cup because nuclear terrorism was only one aspect of 
the strategy.  Becker noted that Germany had cooperated 
closely with the IAEA in the run-up to the World Cup and 
suggested that IAEA experts might be more suitable 
presenters.  He added that an IAEA presentation might also 
highlight strategies used for the 2004 Summer Olympics in 
Greece.
