SUBJECT: Comoros on Guatemala for the UNSC 
 
REF: A) STATE 173465 
 
B) STATE 159380 
 
¶1. (SBU)  After repeated attempts throughout the day, Charge was 
unable to contact a senior official of the Union of the Comoros to 
discuss the UNGA vote on membership on the UNSC as requested in Ref 
¶A.  President Sambi is apparently traveling in Saudi Arabia and will 
not return to Comoros until Friday, October 20.  Foreign Minister 
Jaffar is also traveling abroad and Vice President Ikililou 
Dhoinine, the highest level government official remaining in country 
during this period of the end of Ramadan and leading into the 
beginning of Id Al-Fitr, was unavailable or otherwise unreachable. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Under the circumstances, Post considers it likely that the 
Comoran PermRep remains under instructions to continue supporting 
Guatemala for the UNSC seat, especially considering President 
Sambi's positive response to A/S Frazer's demarche during their 
meeting 21 September (Ref B). 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Embassy will resume efforts on Thursday, October 19, to 
seek an appropriate interlocutor to urge steadfast support of 
Guatemala's candidacy.  We will forward any further information or 
responses septel.
