SUBJECT: DIRECT MAIL WITHIN CUBA - YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  A regular postage stamp to mail a letter 
within Cuba costs less than one penny.  As you would expect, 
however, you get what you pay for.  Domestic service is 
inconsistent, unreliable, much delayed, and, therefore, 
hardly used by most Cubans.  Sending packages and 
international service is even worse.  Post offices are 
predominately used to pay utility bills, cash pension and 
social assistance checks, use the public telephone, and, when 
available, access email.  The Government of Cuba's (GOC) 
decision on June 29 (recently made public) to authorize Cuban 
post offices to provide Internet access is welcome news, even 
if it has not yet taken effect. END SUMMARY 
 
------------ 
Mail in Cuba 
------------ 
 
¶2.  (U) Cuba has 1,044 post offices in the entire country 
(about 1 for every 11,000 people).  Post offices provide some 
or all of the following services: sell stamps, certify 
letters, send telegrams, cash pension and social assistance 
checks, receive payments for telephone, electricity, and 
other utility bills, sell school supplies and post cards, and 
house a public telephone.  There is usually only one post 
office per province that can ship and/or receive large 
packages.  According to official statistics, Cuba processed a 
total of 10,663,900 mail units (letters, small packages, 
etc.) domestically and internationally in 2008; less than one 
unit per person per year.  In addition, Cubans sent another 
2.8 million telegrams through the postal system.  The only 
invoice delivered to residences through the mail is for the 
telephone.  However, one can not pay any bills, including for 
the telephone, through the mail.  All bills have to be paid 
in person either at the post office or directly to the 
specific collector (the water company, electric company, 
phone company, etc.) 
 
¶3.  (U) The cost of sending a regular letter anywhere within 
Cuba is 15 to 20 centavos moneda nacional (Cuban 
non-convertible pesos), which is less than one U.S. cent 
(NOTE:  this is still roughly four times more expensive than 
a first class stamp in the United States when factoring in 
average salaries.  END NOTE)  To send a certified letter 
within Cuba costs just under five cents (USD).  Letters 
mailed to the United States or Europe cost either three cents 
(regular) or seven cents (certified).  Domestic packages 
range from five cents to nine cents per kilogram. 
International packages to the United States or Europe cost 
between 35 cents and $1.43 per kilogram.  The maximum weight 
for packages bound for the United States is two kilograms. 
All prices are paid in moneda nacional and include 
certification and custom procedures for packages.  Anyone who 
can afford to pay in convertible currency can send small 
packages and correspondence via an international courier, 
such as DHL or EMS.  These services are much more expensive 
and reliable.

-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Average mail usage fell 30 percent from the period 
1999-2004 (15,577,150 units per year) to 2005-2008 
(11,211,230).  One of the reasons officially acknowledged has 
been poor service.  The official media has printed on several 
occasions the problems prevailing in the postal service, as 
compared with the relative improvements in the other areas of 
the communications sector (more fixed lines, the introduction 
of mobile phones, and broader email and internet service). 
Among the cited shortcomings are:  instability due to staff 
shortages and turnover; postal crimes, including theft and 
robbery of packages; and the inappropriate use of state funds 
and poor accounting practices.  Delays are common for both 
letters and packages.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that 
packages could take anywhere from seven days to 45 days to 
reach another province within Cuba. International mail and 
packages take even longer.  (NOTE: The Chief of Mission 
mailed himself a postcard from Europe in May 2009 and it is

yet to arrive at U.S. Interests Section in Cuba. END NOTE) 
 
¶5.  (U) Another likely reason for the drop in services is 
increased access to email, the Cuban Intranet, and, for some, 
the Internet.  Domestic and international email services have 
become more available both at public outlets and at state 
companies and institutions.  According to official 
statistics, 43 post offices provide access to email and/or 
Cuba's intranet, including 7-10 facilities in Havana.  The 
rate for using the Intranet and email services (domestic and 
international using a .cu domain name) is $1.62 (CUC 1.50) 
per hour.  This is much cheaper than the tourist Internet 
cafes and hotels ($5 to 12 per hour), but still prohibitively 
expensive for most Cubans taking home less than one dollar 
per day. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In early September, the Cuban Government published 
in its Official Gazette a June 29 decision authorizing the 
Cuban Post Office as a Public Internet Service Provider, 
"which it will make available to private individuals in the 
national territory through its Internet areas."  To our 
knowledge, no post office has started to offer Internet 
services beyond the previous access to email and the Cuban 
intranet.  There is also no indication that the new 
permission will extend to any more than the 43 post offices 
that currently offer limited services.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Allowing Internet access at post offices is 
consistent with some of the GOC's previous measures 
(permitting the sale of mobile phones and computers, access 
to tourist facilities, etc.) to formally remove major 
irritants to the Cuban people, collect a bit of revenue, and 
appear more open to the rest of the world.  The GOC already 
offers heavily restricted but free access to the Internet at 
the 611 Youth Computer Clubs open around the country.  Since 
Cubans who could afford it already had access to the (mostly) 
open Internet at tourist hotels where the Cuban Government 
splits the revenue with foreign joint ventures, this recent 
step simply extends that access to a few more locations with 
the revenue flowing directly into the Government's pockets. 
As the United States and Cuba prepare to sit down this week 
to discuss how to get mail directly from one country to the 
next, the Cuban Government still has a long way to go to 
ensure that those letters and packages will then make their 
way to the intended recipients within the island in a timely 
and secure fashion.
