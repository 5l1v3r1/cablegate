     ¶B. 05 BANJUL 683 ET AL (ALL NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ambassador made ref a demarche April 6 to Permanent 
Secretary of Defense, Joseph Jassey, noting The Gambia's 
 
SIPDIS 
status as a troop contributing country and urging GOTG 
support for an expanded and enhanced UN peacekeeping 
operation in Darfur. Ambassador said that we expected the UN 
to contact the GOTG, given its TCC status, in connection with 
re-hatting plans and asked that the Gambians be as responsive 
as possible to any UN  request for assistance.  He also noted 
 
 
 
past discussions (ref b ) with the GOTG about the possibility 
of increasing the Gambian contingent from company to 
battalion strength and asked for the GOTG's latest thinking 
on this score. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Jassey responded that the GOTG was keen to maintain 
its long-standing record of participation in foreign 
peacekeeping operations, including in Darfur, and gave 
assurances of GOTG's responsiveness to any request for 
assistance from the UN.   He indicated that the commander of 
the Gambian troop contingent in Darfur had already contacted 
Banjul to relay word from AU sources that planning was 
underway for the transition to a UN force. Ambassador 
suggested that the GOTG be pro-active by having its UN 
Permrep in New York and Ambassador in Addis Ababa begin 
consultations now on the re-hatting exercise with 
peacekeeping officials at the UN and AU respectively.  Jassey 
responded that he personally supported this idea and would so 
recommend to President Jammeh (who handles the Defense 
portfolio personally). 
 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Regarding the possible expansion of the Gambian 
contingent to battalion size, Jassey judged that this would 
likely be feasible in  2007; the additional troops could not 
be provided in 2006 due to need for military support in 
connection with security operations surrounding the AU summit 
here in July and the Presidential election scheduled for 
October 2006.  Jasseh went on to note that the Gambian 
military currently lacked the equipment that would be needed 
in increasing its Darfur contingent to battalion size in 
2007; Ambassador urged the GOTG, in its UN and AU 
consultations, to outline its requirements for equipment. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: Per ref b, President Jammeh had indicated, in 
October 2005 conversation with Ambassador, readiness to 
increase The Gambia's Darfur contingent to battalion size, 
provided the GOTG received assistance in meeting  equipment 
requirements.  As the re-hatting operation proceeds, the 
GOTG's top concern will be to avoid having its contingent 
excluded from the UN force -- as it was from UNMIL several 
years ago -- due to the small size of its existing contingent 
and inability to equip a larqer one with its own resources. 
 
 
 
END COMMENT.
