REF:  STATE 1500 
 
(SBU) We delivered reftel demarche January 9 to MFA Deputy Director 
for International Organizations Vadim Smirnov.  Smirnov said that 
although he did not usually handle UNDP issues, Russian practice was 
to support the regional group's choice for positions on UN Boards 
and committees.  He did not know if Moscow had instructed its UN 
Mission on the issue, but said the Mission "knew how to proceed in 
such situations."  He took note of U.S. arguments against Iran's 
Presidency of the UNDP Board and said he would check with the 
Mission, but indicated that Moscow could not agree with the U.S.'s 
approach.
