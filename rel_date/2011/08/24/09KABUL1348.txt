MEETS WITH INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS COMMITTEE 
 
REF: KABUL 1322 
 
¶1. (SBU)  The Ambassador met on May 28 with the Lower House 
International Relations Committee to discuss the new US 
strategy in Afghanistan and listen to MPs' concerns about 
security issues.  MPs, led by committee chairman Abdul 
Rassoul Sayyaf (Kabul, Pashtun), welcomed greater US-Afghan 
cooperation on security issues, attention to border security, 
and promotion of better relations with neighboring countries 
and the Islamic world.  Some MPs asked for greater US support 
to agricultural, infrastructure, and water use sectors.  MPs 
Khudai Nazar Samanchar (Nimrooz, Baluch) and Sayed Ishaq 
Gailani (Paktika, Pashtun) said rule of law and good 
governance were also top concerns for themselves and their 
constituents.  The Ambassador said he hoped this year's 
elections would energize the Afghan people with a rigorous 
debate on the government's performance and candidates' 
visions for the future of Afghanistan. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The Ambassador's meeting was part of a larger 
effort over the next two months to engage with Parliament. 
The Ambassador met Lower House Speaker Qanooni on May 18, and 
will soon call on Upper House Deputy Speaker Hamed Gailani 
(sitting in for Speaker Sebghatullah Mojaddedi, who is in 
Turkey for lengthy medical treatment).  The Ambassador plans 
to continue his Parliament outreach through a series of 
meetings with legislative committees.  The goal is to focus 
on a substantive agenda, see as many MPs as possible in a 
timely manner, and minimize high-profile meetings with 
individual MPs during the election campaign season. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  In other business this week: 
 
- The Lower House passed the Counternarcotics Law after 
adding in several provisions strengthening the government's 
ban on alcohol sales, use, and possession.  MPs approved 
punishments of "public beatings" for public intoxication and 
an eight-year prison sentence for the sale of one liter of 
alcohol.  During the debate, some MPs accused Western 
embassies of bringing alcohol into the country. 
 
- Speaker Qanooni sidetracked the Private Security Companies 
Law by referring the law to the non-existent Commission on 
the Implementation and Oversight of the Constitution 
(reftel).  Several MPs expressed frustration that Qanooni has 
referred controversial legislation to the commission as both 
a means to avoid debate on important issues and to kill bills 
he does not like. 
 
- During debate over continuity of government after the May 
22 constitutional expiration of the president's term, Qanooni 
reprimanded MPs who have represented their personal opinions 
as official Parliamentary positions.  Some 150 MPs have 
publicly sided with a Supreme Court statement authorizing 
President Karzai to remain in office through the Aug. 20 
election, while another 70 MPs have come out against the 
statement.  Qanooni said that while MPs were free to discuss 
their personal opinions with the public, neither side had 
successfully passed a resolution that put the Lower House on 
record one way or the either.
