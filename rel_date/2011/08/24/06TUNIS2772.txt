SUBJECT:  Erroneous Media Reports of a U.S./Tunisia Free Trade 
Agreement 
 
REF:  Tunis 2771 
 
¶1. (U)  Local news media recently published an article indicating 
that despite a relative slowdown of talks between the two parties, 
the U.S. and Tunisia were exploring opportunities aimed at 
concluding a Free Trade Agreement and mentioning that work groups 
have been set up to look into the services sector and IPR.  It was 
also reported that in order to conclude an FTA with the United 
States, Tunisia would have to be willing to undertake some difficult 
commitments in such fields as updating their judicial system in 
order to promote transparency and to encourage the participation of 
the private sector in the process.  This was followed a few days 
later by the publication of an erroneous Italian Press Agency 
article indicating that the United States and Tunisia had signed an 
FTA. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On querying the Ministry of Development and International 
Cooperation (MDIC) about the probable source of these articles, 
Econoff was told that the Italian press article was probably just a 
bad translation of the Tunisian article.  According to MDIC, the 
Tunisian piece was "obviously" written by "a well-informed source or 
a person who knows exactly what has been achieved within the TIFA 
process so far." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Given that the GOT to a large degree controls the 
domestic media, the publication of such an article is not a 
coincidence.  Rather, it may represent a GOT signal of renewed 
interest in the TIFA process.  In this regard, Post will continue to 
watch closely to see whether the removal of pirated optical discs 
(Reftel) will be extended throughout the retail sector.  Post will 
also watch for other indications that the GOT is serious about 
reinvigorating the TIFA process.  End Comment.
