¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: POLOFF and ECONOFF shared reftel A points 
to key contacts at the Dutch MFA, including:  EU 
Correspondent Desiree Kopmels, Deputy EU Correspondent Rochus 
Pronk, and Wendela Haringhuizen, Senior Policy Officer, 
Terrorism and New Threats Unit.  Iran sanctions points were 
also shared with Anne-Chris Visser, Senior Advisor, Integrity 
Division, Ministry of Finance. In a December 6 briefing for 
Hague diplomats, Pronk and MFA European Integration 
Department staff Bert van der Lingen reviewed the Dutch 
position on EU enlargement, Economic Partnership Agreements, 
Kosovo and the Balkans, Iran, the Middle East Peace Process, 
Burma, Sudan/Chad, and the EU-Africa Summit (para 2-9). 
Dutch positions generally match U.S. interests, but their 
position on Kosovo will require further bilateral engagement 
(para 3 & 10, reftel C). END SUMMARY. 
 
ENLARGEMENT, ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Dutch are satisfied with the reports on 
enlargement but want to ensure that the EU is strict about 
all candidates meeting the criteria set for them.  If the EU 
cannot conclude Economic Partnership Agreements with Africa, 
Caribbean, and the Pacific (ACP) countries by January 1, 
2008, the Dutch will support temporary arrangements.  The 
Dutch priority is to ensure that ACP countries do not have a 
worse deal under any new agreement (reftel B). 
 
KOSOVO AND THE BALKANS 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Dutch appreciate the Troika's work and are 
disappointed that it did not succeed.  The Dutch will urge 
the parties in Kosovo and Serbia to avoid violence.  However, 
given the Troika's report to the UNSYG will be December 10, 
it's too early to speak about a unilateral declaration of 
independence.  The Dutch want to take the process "step by 
step, day by day."  They want to prepare for a larger 
civilian role in Kosovo.  The Dutch do not want to see a 
unilateral declaration of independence but support a 
coordinated declaration with EU unanimity.  However, UNSC 
resolution 1244 does not provide a sound legal basis for an 
international presence in an independent Kosovo. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On Serbia, FM Verhagen will not sign the 
Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) until fugitive 
Ratko Mladic has been brought to the Hague. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On Bosnia, the Dutch have questions about the SAA 
decision.  The Dutch will look closely at the police 
agreement and the three other conditions for Bosnia to 
determine whether they will sign the SAA. 
 
IRAN 
---- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Dutch are pleased with the National Intelligence 
Estimate, and FM Verhagen has stated there will be no change 
to Dutch policy.  There are "too many elements" to Iran's 
nuclear program for it to be civil in nature.  The Dutch 
support a diplomatic resolution, presume that a third UNSC 
resolution will be necessary, and support looking at EU 
sanctions if action at the UNSC is not possible. 
 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Dutch are "very happy with Annapolis" and also 
with the "active involvement of the U.S."  It's a long road 
ahead, and there are obstacles.  The EU action plan from 
October is important.  EU aid to the Palestinians will focus 
on EU capabilities, such as capacity building, water 
resources, education, and reconstruction.  Israel deserves 
support, and the Dutch will put forward proposals for 
cooperation.  The Dutch welcome the appointment of Ambassador 
Robert Serry as UN Middle East Envoy. 
 
BURMA 
----- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Dutch fully support UNSYG Special Envoy Gambari. 
 It's important to keep Burma on the agenda as the 
international focus is already shifting away from Burma.  The 
Dutch are not optimistic about the situation on the ground 
based on recent events.  In January, the European Council 
should look at additional sanctions if the current situation 
continues. 
 
SUDAN, CHAD 
----------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The Dutch support the UK proposal to put Sudan on 
the agenda.  The international community should maintain 
pressure on the GoS given the continuing problems in Darfur, 
CPA implementation, and in the UNAMID deployment.  The Dutch 
are considering a contribution in Chad. 
 
EU-AFRICA SUMMIT 
---------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) The Dutch are working "until the last moment" to 
ensure President Mugabe gets a strong message on human 
rights.  His participation in the summit is unfortunate.  The 
EU presidency has guaranteed the Dutch an opportunity to 
speak about the situation in Zimbabwe, but the Dutch are 
uncertain about the logistics.  Chancellor Merkel will give 
the formal address on Mugabe and human rights.  The 
Portuguese presidency or High Representative Solana may also 
say something. 
 
¶10. (SBU) COMMENT: On Kosovo, Legal Advisor John Bellinger is 
expected to sound out the Dutch during a meeting with MFA 
Deputy DG Wim Geerts on December 10.  The Dutch reaction will 
guide next steps for the USG (ref C).  END COMMENT.
