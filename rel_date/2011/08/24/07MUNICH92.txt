SUBJECT:  APPRECIATION FOR MISSION GERMANY ASSISTANCE WITH THE 
MUNICH SECURITY CONFERENCE 
 
REFS: A) 06 MUNICH 838, B) Munich 81 
 
¶1.  Consulate General Munich wishes to express its appreciation for 
the assistance provided by colleagues in Mission Germany supporting 
the 43d Munich Security Conference.  This was the largest Security 
Conference in history with four heads of government, 16 foreign 
ministers, and 24 defense ministers.  The U.S. delegation held 17 
bilateral meetings.  U.S. participation was substantial, with a 
total delegation of 242, including Secretary of Defense Gates, a 
senior-level CODEL with 10 members of Congress headed by Senators 
Lieberman and McCain, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Kimmitt, EUR 
PDAS Volker, Ambassador to Germany Timken, Ambassador to NATO 
Nuland, Ambassador Galbraith of USNATO, and representatives from 
USOSCE, EUR/RPM, and EUR/AGS. 
 
¶2.  In particular, post would like to recognize the following 
offices/individuals from elsewhere in Mission Germany who assisted 
with the conference.  Without their assistance and teamwork, our 
Mission could not have made the important participation by senior 
U.S. Government officials at the conference a success: 
 
- Berlin DATT/ODC (Dave Allwine, Mike Curci, Tim McCandless, Peter 
Richter, Dan Stiver):  for assisting in coordination with the Office 
of the Secretary of Defense. 
 
- Berlin GSO (Jafar Butt, Stefan Knop):  for providing excellent 
chauffeur services in an extremely difficult traffic/security 
environment. 
 
- Berlin PA (Maja Boehm, Anne Chermak, Nancy Rajczak, Julia 
Sebastian, Robert Wood):  for arranging press interviews for U.S. 
participants, including Ambassador Timken, Ambassador Nuland, and 
Deputy Treasury Secretary Kimmitt; providing rapid transcriptions of 
Secretary Gates' remarks; and preparing media reaction. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
- Berlin Pol-Mil (Ken Kero, Thorsten Schulz, Mark Wilson):  for 
notetaking during conference sessions and providing rapid, detailed 
reporting to Washington.

principal VIPs. 
 
- DCM John Koenig:  for outstanding strategic guidance in planning
