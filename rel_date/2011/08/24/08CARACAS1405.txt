SUBJECT: EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FROM BRV PARLIAMENT FOR FIVE 
CUBAN SPIES 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Embassy received an official statement of 
support from the National Assembly (NA) of the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela (BRV) for five Cuban citizens held in 
the United States on spying charges.  The expression of 
support, passed by the NA on September 23, 2008, condemns the 
case against the men as political and a violation of their 
human rights.  On September 29, Minister for Work and Social 
Security Roberto Hernandez reiterated the claim of human 
rights violations in the case of the five and said the 
Venezuelan Association of Bolivarian Lawyers would offer 
"juridical support" to them.  Hernandez gave no further 
detail on what kind of support the Bolivarian lawyers might 
provide to the men (Gerardo Hernandez Nordelo, Ramon Labanino 
Salazar, Antonio Guerrero Rodriguez, Fernando Gonzalez Llort, 
and Rene Gonzalez Sehwerert). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post will send the original document by diplomatic 
pouch to the Venezuela Desk.  Begin excerpts from text of the 
NA statement: 
 
Considering: 
 
That since September 12, 1998, the Cuban citizens....find 
themselves deprived of their liberty by long sentences 
imposed by judges of the city of Miami; 
 
That sentences of the five Cuban citizens in the United 
States is a political case disguised under legal pretexts; 
 
That these citizens are subjected to atrocious conditions of 
reclusion, deprived of visits from their wives and children, 
that have gone years without information on the cases of the 
detained, while the Government of the United States loses no 
opportunity to promote itself in the world as a state that 
respects human rights; 
 
Declares: 
 
Rejection of the deprival of liberty of the Cuban citizens. 
 
Insistence that the United States...take steps to free these 
Cuban citizens. 
 
Expression of solidarity of the Venezuelan Parliament with 
these Cuban citizens. 
 
Condemnation of the violation of these five Cuban citizens 
and their families by United States authorities. 
 
Manifestation of satisfaction of this deliberative body for 
the many expressions of solidarity expressed by the 
international community in relation to the detention and 
violation of the human rights of those citizens. 
 
End excerpts.
