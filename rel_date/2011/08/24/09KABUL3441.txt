¶1. (SBU) Afghan Foreign Minister Spanta confirmed to Deputy 
Ambassador Ricciardone October 26 that the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs had transmitted the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the study 
of unauthorized trade to the Government of Pakistan earlier that 
day.  Spanta said "the misunderstanding was in my house," referring 
to the MFA's refusal to transmit the TOR by Oct 22 as promised.  The 
Afghans, and we, hope that this action should enable the 
Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement negotiations to 
proceed. 
 
¶2. (U) The Ministry of Commerce and Industries transmitted a signed 
copy of the diplomatic note to Embassy Kabul on October 27. 
Informal translation from the original Dari follows:
