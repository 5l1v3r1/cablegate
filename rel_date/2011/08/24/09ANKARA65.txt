REF: ANKARA 0003 
 
(SBU) During a January 14 with MFA Undersecretary Ertugrul 
Apakan, the Ambassador raised the seizure by Turkey of an 
illicit shipment from Iran to Venezuela (reftel).  The 
Ambassador praised Turkey's vigilance and said that, like the 
transit of a rail shipment of weapons from Iran which was 
disrupted by a terrorist attack two years ago, this seizure 
showed that Iran sought to use Turkey's territory to violate 
UN Security Council Resolutions.  Reading from a prepared 
brief on the subject, Apakan said that an inter-agency 
investigation of the shipment is continuing, but Turkey's 
Atomic Energy Agency (TAEK) had already examined the shipment 
and had determined that no nuclear materials or dual use 
items were present.  Other agencies continued their 
investigation with regard to export control regimes.  Turkey 
will notify the U.S. as soon as this process was complete.
