 ¶1.  (SBU) Pol/Econ Chief met November 24 with Joseph 
Kabakeza, Director General of Bilateral and Multilateral 
Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to discuss 
reftel demarches on Anti-Israel resolutions (ref B) and the 
Non-Proliferation resolution (ref A).  Kabakeza said his 
ministry would give careful consideration to the request to 
vote against anti-Israel resolutions, particularly the three 
resolutions to extend the three specialized bodies focusing 
on Palestinian rights.  Agreeing that these resolutions add 
little to the search for peace, and often served simply to 
aggravate Israeli public opinion, Kabakeza cautioned that 
Rwanda often did not attend such votes, as its "skeletal" 
delegation could not track all the issues in the busy UNGA 
session. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Kabakeza also listened attentively to the demarche 
points on the Compliance resolution passed by the First 
Committee, agreeing that the overwhelmingly positive vote in 
the First Committee showed the strong support the 
international community had for this resolution.  He promised 
to consult closely with the Foreign Minister in framing 
Rwanda's position.
