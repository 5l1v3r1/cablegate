Japan welcomes the unanimous adoption of Security Council 
Resolution 1701 calling for a full cessation of hostilities 
by Israel and Hizbollah as well as for Israel and Lebanon to 
support a permanent ceasefire and a long-term solution based 
on the political framework stated in this resolution. 
 
Japan has been calling for an immediate ceasefire to avoid 
further civilian victims and deterioration of the situation, 
and has been urging the parties concerned to make their 
utmost efforts and to exercise self-restraint towards a 
solution of the problem.  Recognizing the necessity for the 
Security Council to address the issue promptly, Japan has 
also closely coordinated with the concerned countries for 
early adoption of the draft resolution. 
 
Japan will continue to call upon all parties concerned, based 
on the resolution, to realize an immediate ceasefire, to 
immediately agree upon the political framework stated in the 
resolution, and to exert maximum effort to restore stability 
in the region. 
 
Japan will continue to contribute actively to the efforts to 
build mid- and long-term stability in the region as a whole 
when it is restored based on the resolution.
