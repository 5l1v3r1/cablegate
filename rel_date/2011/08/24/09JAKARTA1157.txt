REF: A. JAKARTA - OPS CENTER 07-08-09 TELECONS/EMAILS 
     ¶B. JAKARTA 1149 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified; it was 
coordinated with Consulates Medan and Surabaya. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Indonesia's presidential election went 
smoothly and peacefully on July 8.  Preliminary exit polls 
indicate that President Yudhoyono is likely to win by a 
landslide, with 60.83 percent of the vote.  Main opponent 
Megawati is at 26.47 percent while Vice President Kalla is 
lagging behind at 12.7 percent of the vote.  If this result 
is confirmed, there will be no need for a second round of 
voting.  Official results are expected later this month.  All 
in all, the Election Commission--which has received USG 
assistance--seems to have run a reasonably effective election 
apparatus.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ELECTION PEACEFUL 
 
¶3.   (SBU) Emboffs who observed the election in various 
locations across the country reported that the process seemed 
secure, free and peaceful.  DCM observed polling stations in 
Menteng, Central Jakarta, while others observed polling 
stations from Aceh to Central Java to the Kalimantan region. 
Some 250,000 police were deployed across the country to 
maintain security.  Voters seemed relaxed and little tension 
was reported. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Figures on voter participation are not yet in but 
roughly 75 percent of Indonesians probably turned out.  The 
election news from Aceh Province in Sumatra was positive and 
violence-free.  In Papua, voting went smoothly.  However, in 
the Timika region of southern Papua some 15-20 people burned 
three vehicles owned by U.S. mining company Freeport McMoran 
and ransacked several offices early on July 8.  No one was 
injured.  The incident was probably politically-motivated 
(though it is unclear whether it had a link to the national 
election), as perpetrators were apprehended carrying the 
Papuan flag.  No other incidents in the restive Papuan region 
have been reported. 
 
DESPITE CONCERNS, POLLING ORDERLY 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Polls opened and closed mostly on time, although 
some extra time was required to register unregistered voters 
using their national identity cards to vote (a court had 
ruled on July 6 that citizens could vote using ID cards if 
they were not on the registration list).  With only three 
candidates to choose from, the voting process was much faster 
than during the complicated legislative elections in April. 
All in all, the Election Commission--which has received USG 
assistance--seems to have run a reasonably effective election 
apparatus. 
 
PRESIDENT WITH BIG LEAD IN EARLY RETURNS 
 
¶6.  (SBU) President Yudhoyono seems headed for a huge 
victory.  Early quick count results from the most reliable 
survey institute, Lembaga Survei Institute, indicated that 
President Yudhoyono has an early lead of 60.83 percent of the 
vote, with Megawati at 26.47 percent and Vice President Kalla 
lagging behind at 12.7 percent.  Although quick counts are 
now flowing in from several survey institutes, they remain 
preliminary, but all show that Yudhoyono has a huge lead both 
nationally and in at least 24 provinces.  If official results 
confirm that he has won over 50% of the vote nationally and 
at least twenty percent of votes in 17  provinces (two 
requirements which he has apparently exceeded), he wins 
outright and there will be no runoff election in September. 
Official results are expected later this month.  The 
inauguration of the next president is in October.
