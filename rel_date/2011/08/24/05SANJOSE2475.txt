Post delivered Reftel talking points on October 14.  In a 
follow-up meeting with the MFA's chief of multilateral 
policy, Carlos Cordero, Poloff thanked the GOCR for its 
historic support of Israel, and asked for continued 
cooperation in both approving International Holocaust 
Remembrance Day and in rejecting resolutions with an 
anti-Israeli bias.  Cordero explained that Costa Rica has 
long felt a certain kinship with Israel, given the concurrent 
timing of Israel's establishment with Costa Rica's revolution 
in 1948.  He emphasized that Costa Rica was one of the very 
first nations to recognize Israel, and noted that Costa Rica 
is proud to be a co-sponsor on the Holocaust Remembrance 
resolution.  While Cordero stopped short of promising a "no" 
vote on all potentially anti-Israel biased measures, given 
Costa Rica's attempts to maintain cordial relationships with 
Arab nations, he did promise that Costa Rica would at a 
minimum continue to abstain on such resolutions.
