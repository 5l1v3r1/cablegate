SUBJECT: FRIENDS OF IRAQ CONFERENCE DRAFT AGENDA PASSED TO

REF: A. STATE 56560 
     ¶B. OTTAWA 693 
 
¶1. (U)  Poloff passed a copy of the draft agenda for the 
Friends of Iraq Conference to Iraq Desk Officer David Leach 
of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
on May 30.  Leach thanked us for keeping Canada in the loop, 
but reconfirmed that Canada would not send a representative 
to the conference. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Comment: Canada's minority government feels the 
need to steer clear of Iraq military operations in order to 
manage its still politically sensitive but militarily 
significant mission in Afghanistan.  Canada nonetheless 
continues to try to play a useful role in Iraq, especially as 
a generous donor.  Embassy hopes to receive a timely readout 
of the conference that we can share with the Canadian 
government, especially if we can use it to highlight programs 
on which Canada's additional assistance could make a 
difference there.
