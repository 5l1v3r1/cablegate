SUBJECT: GEORGIAN NATO MISSION STATEMENT ON SITUATION IN 
SOUTH OSSETIA 
 
¶1. (SBU) On August 8, the Georgian Mission to NATO 
distributed the following statement to Allies: 
 
Statement of the Government of Georgia regarding the 
situation in the South Ossetia region of Georgia 
 
Over the last several hours, separatist rebels in South 
Ossetia have undertaken a series of military attacks against 
unarmed civilians and peacekeeping forces in several villages 
near Tskhinvali.  Their actions constitute an extreme 
escalation of an already dangerous situation. 
 
These latest attacks took place after President Mikheil 
Saakashvili announced a unilateral ceasefire by Georgia and 
appealed for peace talks. 
 
The separatist rebels, in defiance of this call, subsequently 
attacked several villages near Tskinvali.  On August 7, at 
22:30 local time, they attacked the village of Prisi, which 
was followed one hour later by an attack on the village of 
Tamarasheni.  Civilians and peacekeepers came under massive 
shelling.  The attacks resulted in several dead and wounded. 
 
According to available data, hundred of armed personnel and 
heavy military equipment have crossed from Russia to Georgia 
through the Roki tunnel. 
 
To protect peaceful civilian populations and to prevent 
further military attacks, the Government of Georgia has been 
forced to take adequate measures. 
 
Despite this most recent escalation, the Government of 
Georgia once again reiterates its readiness to immediately 
begin peace talks aimed at resolving the conflict in South 
Ossetia and calls on the separatist rebels to cease their 
military actions and come to the negotiation table.
