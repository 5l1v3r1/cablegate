COMMITTEE MEETING, SEPTEMBER 24, NEW YORK 
 
REF: SECSTATE 128326 
 
Â¶1. We delivered reftel demarche on September 14 to Timur 
Zabirov of the MFA Middle East and North Africa Department. 
Zabirov said that the GOR appreciated that the Secretary's 
attendance at the AHLC demonstrates U.S. support for the 
Palestinian Authority and that a suitably high-level official 
would head the Russian delegation.  The MFA could not confirm 
whether FM Lavrov would attend as he is currently out of the 
country.
