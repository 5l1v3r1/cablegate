SUBJECT: CANADA MIGHT CONSIDER FURTHER DEBT RELIEF FOR IRAQ 
 
REF: SECSTATE 181094 
 
(sbu)  Econcouns delivered reftel points urging Canada to 
forgive the remaining 20 percent of its Iraqi debt to Canada 
International Development Agency (CIDA) Director Daniel Joly 
on November 8.  Joly said he was already familiar with the 
USG request from recent meetings in Washington and the 
November Preparatory Group meeting in Kuwait.  Joly stated 
that he would share our points within the GOC, and would look 
into the possibility of further debt forgiveness or providing 
the equivalent in grants.  He said, however, that any 
reduction would have to be considered within the context of 
the Paris Club terms and GOC commitments in other 
international fora.
