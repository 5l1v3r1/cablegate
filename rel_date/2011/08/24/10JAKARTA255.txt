¶1.  This message is Sensitive but Unclassified, please handle 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On February 23, Poloff and DRL Senior Policy 
Advisor Susan O'Sullivan met with officials from the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Directorates of Human Rights and 
Humanitarian Affairs and Multilateral Affairs.  We expressed 
our concern that the attention generated by the Goldstone 
Report harms Special Envoy Mitchell's peace efforts.  We also 
noted that investigations by both Israel and Palestine into 
the alleged violations are ongoing, so any resolution would 
be premature and counterproductive.  However, if there 
remains further discussion of the Goldstone Report in the 
United Nations, we urged that it be limited to the Human 
Rights Council. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Diana Emilla Sari Sutikno, Deputy Director for 
Human Rights and Vulnerable Groups said that Indonesia would 
vote with the OIC block.  That said, she pointed out that 
there was no consensus within the OIC on this issue and that 
the OIC was being very careful to examine each resolution to 
ensure it was fair.  Deputy Director of Human Rights and 
Humanitarian Affairs Primanto Hendrasmoro said he would take 
the points on board, but had no other response.
