SUBJECT:  Disputed election sparks violence in Aceh 
 
 
¶1. (U) This is a joint Medan - Jakarta message. 
 
¶2. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Summary:  Clashes broke out at the inauguration of the new 
regent for Southeast Aceh District on September 1.  A dozen 
demonstrators were arrested, 16 people were injured, and a local 
government office was torched.  At the center of the conflict is a 
former regent who has refused to accept defeat in an election.  The 
violence is localized and does not threaten the peace accord.  End 
Summary. 
 
Turbulence in SE Aceh 
--------------------- 
¶4. (U) On September 1, Governor Irwandi Yusuf installed Hasanuddin 
Beruh (Sanu) as the new regent (the highest level local official) of 
Southeast Aceh District (Agara).  Despite the presence of more than 
200 riot police (Brimob), the event was marred by violence when a 
mob of several thousand seeking to disrupt the event clashed with 
police.  By the end of the day, the budget and planning office had 
been burned, a dozen demonstrators had been detained, and 16 
people--including six police officers-had been injured.  The 
situation returned to normal on September 2.  The Free Aceh Movement 
(GAM) played no role in the conflict. (Note:  GAM and the Indonesian 
government signed a peace accord in August 2005.) 
 
¶5. (U) The violence was not wholly unexpected.  Ever since the 
December 2007 local elections, demonstrations and conflict have been 
commonplace in the district.  The conflict has intensified during 
the past several months, however.  Since July, several government 
offices, a primary school, and a market have been burned and the 
regent's office was attacked with a hand grenade. 
 
A Tarnished Former Regent 
------------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) Observers uniformly blame the violence on former regent 
Armen Desky.  When he was regent, Desky and his family treated the 
district like a fiefdom, according to contacts, and members of the 
clan occupied every significant government position in the district. 
 Opponents accuse Desky of looting the budget by steering government 
contracts to firms controlled by his family and he has been directly 
implicated in several major illegal logging cases. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Despite his murky reputation, Desky was a leading candidate 
in the December 2007 local elections because of his seemingly tight 
control over the district and his campaign's very deep pockets. 
According to election day vote counts at polling stations, however, 
Sanu won the election soundly, receiving more than 25 percent of the 
vote in the multi-candidate field. 
 
A Disputed Election 
------------------- 
¶8. (SBU) Several weeks after the election, district-level election 
officials reported results which had implausibly shifted in favor of 
Desky.  Observers and journalists cried foul, and the provincial 
election commission ordered that all ballots be sent to Banda Aceh 
for a recount.  Election officials in Banda Aceh ultimately declared 
Sanu the winner. 
 
¶9. (U) Having lost the battle with the provincial election 
commission, pro-Desky district-level election officials turned to 
the courts.  A local court found in favor of Desky, but this ruling 
was eventually overturned by the provincial court in Banda Aceh.  In 
early August, the Ministry of Home Affairs ordered Sanu's 
installation as regent. 
 
Localized Conflict 
------------------ 
¶10. (SBU) According to reports, Desky and his supporters still 
refuse to acknowledge that he lost the election.  This means that 
the new regent will face continued intransigence and probably more 
turbulence.  Given that GAM is not involved and the GOI is taking a 
largely positive role in trying to tamp down the tension, the 
situation in SE Aceh--while unstable--does not threaten the peace 
accord.
