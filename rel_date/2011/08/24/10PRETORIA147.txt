¶1. (SBU) PolCouns passed A/S Carson's request for a meeting 
with President Zuma on the margins of the AU Summit to 
Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) 
USA Director on January 15, and included contact information 
for USAU acting DCM Maybury.  DIRCO officials acknowledged 
passing this information to members of the delegation and 
their AU mission, but were initially reluctant to provide 
further information. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On January 22, PolCouns reached Roxane Human of the 
DIRCO African Union desk.  She confirmed that the SAG 
delegation (the main group of which will depart on Saturday, 
January 23) had received the request, but did not know what 
the response would be.  She was able to confirm that both 
President Zuma and DIRCO Minister Nkoana-Mashabane would be 
in Addis Ababa for the summit.  She said the contact person 
with the delegation would be a Miss T. Tsheole, who would be 
carrying cellphone (251) (0)91-033-1327 and be monitoring 
e-mail TsheoleT@foreign.gov.za.  A Mr. Thabo Thage might also 
be able to help.  He would be carrying cellphone (27) 
(0)82-940-0646.
