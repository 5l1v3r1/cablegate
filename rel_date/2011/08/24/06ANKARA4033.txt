opportunity to share ideas on the security of ports and

the ratification of the NP Agreement by Turkish Parliament. 
EXBS Advisor also sought feedback about the recently 
completed risk management workshop conducted by Denmark for 
Turkish Customs.  Guzel informed EXBS Advisor that the 
workshop was very useful and presented new ideas which Turkey

Docuart International,  to complete the PIT project. 
Ozyazici stated that she had just received the information 
that her department was now coordinating this project and 
that she needed to do additional research.  Ozyazici 
requested a meeting with the ICP contractor to discuss the 
capabilities of the company, the specific work that would be 
accomplished by the company and the input/oversight that 
would be provided by Turkish Customs.  This would allow her

senior Customs officials soon.
