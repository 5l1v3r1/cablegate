¶1. (U) Summary. On 3 November Kigali City Mayor, Dr. Aisa 
Kirabo Kacyira, briefed diplomatic corps and a small group of 
stakeholders on her strategic vision for the city.  Kacyira 
presented her municipal government's mission, to make Kigali 
"a safer, cleaner, more competitive modern city with 
expanding opportunity for sustainable development of its 
citizens and the country at large," and engaged the audience 
in a discussion on the issues of the day for Kigali.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Background.  On 1 January 2006 the government 
implemented a decentralization plan designed to make all 
levels of government more efficient (ref A).  Part of the 
plan was the consolidation of Kigali City into three 
districts- Gasabo, Kicukiro and Nyrugenge- administered by 
district mayors in conjunction with the Kigali City Council, 
headed by the Kigali Mayor.  Kacyrira, a member of the ruling 
Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and former parliamentarian was 
elected mayor on 4 March 2006 (ref B). End background. 
 
¶3. (U) In her well delivered power point presentation Kacyira 
gave the city high marks for its security, cleanliness and 
good governance.  She identified the significant challenges 
for Kigali City as high unemployment, large numbers of 
vulnerable groups (e.g. street children and widows), 
infrastructure capacity (e.g. water and power capacity), 
unplanned and uncontrolled settlement and an inadequate level 
of skilled human resources to drive economic development. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment. Kaycyira was very much the practiced 
politician hitting the key issues while avoiding detailed 
plans to address them.  She continually emphasized "service 
delivery" while deftly deflecting complaints about lack of 
water and poor trash collection.  While the challenges are 
significant, Kacyira has at least demonstrated a solid grasp 
of the positives and negatives of the current situation and a 
willingness to openly discuss her vision with a select 
audience.  She also has a strong background as both a 
politician and manager and post believes she has the full 
backing of President Kagame and the RPF.  End comment.
