SUBJECT: SPANISH OBJECTIVES FOR THE 2010 EU PRESIDENCY: 
FINANCIAL REFORM AND GENDER EQUALITY 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY. January 23, Spain's Council of Ministers 
approved the strategic plan for Spain's January-June 2010 EU 
Presidency.  According to the plan, Spain's Presidency will 
possess a "marked pro-European character and an open social 
sensibility, in a year against poverty and exclusion."  The 
Presidency will focus on gender equality, education and 
tolerance, and the financial crisis.  Spain expects to host 
an EU-US Summit as well as an EU-Latin American Summit during 
the Presidency as well. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) Spain announced the following framework after the 
January 15 Budapest meeting of the Spanish, Belgian, and 
Hungarian Secretaries of State in charge of European Affairs 
to coordinate strategic agendas for the EU Presidency.  As 
approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers, Spain's 
January-June 2010 Presidency will launch the following EU 
trio themes and initiatives: a renewed EU social agenda to 
include equality and the fight against violence; the 
2010-2012 Energy Plan; planning and execution of Copenhagen's 
December 2009 Climate Change package; development of an 
economic strategy post-Lisbon treaty; promotion of the EU 
Space for Liberty, Security and Justice (SLSJ) for the period 
of 2010-2014; sustainable use of natural resources; EU 
enlargement, to include possible Croatia accession and a push 
toward Turkish integration; and the stable advancement of the 
EU neighborhood policy to the Mediterranean and the East. 
 
¶3. (U) Spain's own presidency goals focus on equality issues 
and the economy, and will address the need for a European 
policy for Security and Defense.  The development of a common 
European diplomatic core has also been discussed.  The 
Council of Ministers declared that Spain will give special 
priority to the right of equality, and specifically gender 
equality.  Given the financial climate, Spain will also use 
its Presidency to help Europe find its way out of the crisis 
and recover stability in the markets and employment.  To this 
end, Spain foresees the development of a European and global 
agreement for a new model of social and economic growth that 
will incorporate financial systems, markets, climate change 
and energy policies, employment and social cohesion policy, 
and the fight against hunger.  In his January 27 speech to 
the High Level Meeting on Food Security hosted by Spain, 
President Zapatero said that a "great priority" for Spain's 
EU Presidency would be policies "in favor of development and 
the fight against hunger and misery."  During the first 
semester of 2010, Spain expects to host an EU-US Summit and 
EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit, giving the Presidency 
a "euroamerican" dimension.  During this time, too, the 
biannual Summit of the Union of the Mediterranean will take 
place, and the Spanish Presidency will participate in summits 
with Japan, Russia, and Canada.  Africa, ASEM, and ASEAN 
Summits will all take place during Belgium's Presidency in 
the second half of 2010.
