¶1. (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Division for 
International Organizations and Human Security Staffer 
Smiljana Knez contacted PolOff March 22 to add to reftel 
demarche response from March 21.  Knez said that Slovenia is 
well aware of the seriousness of the situation in Zimbabwe 
and will work in Geneva to reach a solution that would be 
efficient and helpful.  She said that the GOS feels the most 
important issue for the United Nations Human Rights Council 
(HRC) is adopting a resolution on Sudan and indicated that it 
is EU consensus to prioritize Sudan and not let the issue of 
Zimbabwe undermine this effort.  Knez believed the Sudan 
resolution would likely be adopted on March 23, giving the 
HRC an opportunity to address other topics Monday and onward. 
 Noting that there are several methods of approaching an HRC 
action on Zimbabwe, Knez said the EU plans will be a 
concentrated, coordinated approach, with each country 
commenting on the seriousness of the issue the same 
afternoon.  She said the GOS felt working towards a 
resolution was "very risky" given the downsides of losing a 
potential vote, and that this was a topic of intense 
discussion in Geneva. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Knez was unsure of whether the GOS would issue an 
individual condemnation of Zimbabwe's actions, stating that 
this would be coordinated with the political departments and 
the Foreign Minister's cabinet. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Given the GOS's nervousness about winning a 
seat on the HRC after its loss last year, it is likely to be 
particularly cautious regarding any actions which could 
alienate potential supporters before the May 2007 vote.  That 
said, Slovenia is likely to follow the EU consensus decision 
on this issue.  End Comment.
