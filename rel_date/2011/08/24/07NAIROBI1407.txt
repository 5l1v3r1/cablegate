(SBU)  The Embassy received on March 29 Kenyan Diplomatic Note 
MFA.231/21/001A dated March 27, 2007, marked "URGENT", regarding 
Kenyan vessel MV Rozen captured by Somali pirates on February 25. 
Text follows: 
 
Quote. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kenya presents 
its compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America and 
has the honour to inform that the continued uncertainty regarding 
the 6 Kenyan and 6 Sri Lankan crew aboard the UN chartered Kenyan 
cargo ship, MV Rozen, captured on 25th February 2007 off the 
Somali waters is causing a lot of concern. 
 
The Transitional Federal Government has been approached to use all 
available means to intervene in the issue.  Meanwhile the Motaku 
Shipping Company, which owns the ship, has been trying to 
negotiate for the release of the ship and crew. 
 
The capture of four of the pirates on 27th February 2007 while 
trying to replenish their supplies by the government of the semi- 
autonomous region of Puntland makes it imperative that something 
has to be done to ensure safety and release of the crew as well 
the ship. 
 
The Ministry in this regard wishes to request for the assistance 
of the United States of America to deploy all available resources 
at its disposal to ensure quick resolution of this matter. 
 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kenya avails 
itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the United 
States of America the assurances of its highest consideration.
