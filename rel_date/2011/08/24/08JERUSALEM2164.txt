Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds leads with the collapse of the electricity grid in Gaza.  An 
electricity company representative explains that transformers 
serving densely populated areas collapsed under the "intense 
pressure" and lack of spare parts caused by Israel's refusal to 
allow needed parts into the Strip.  All papers report that Israel 
resealed Gaza crossings on November 27, after a Palestinian 
projectile was fired into Israel, "causing no damage."  Al Quds' 
inside page cites Israel's Ma'ariv daily in revealing that Hamas has 
longer range rockets in Gaza that can hit Beer Sheva in southern 
Israel.  The paper adds that Hamas received the rockets from 
Hizbollah. 
In Gaza humanitarian news, Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page reports 
that 45 trucks with food, animal feed and chlorine for water 
sterilization were allowed into Gaza on November 27.  Al Quds' front 
page notes that a Gazan mother of five died on November 27, after 
Israeli authorities prevented her from exiting Gaza for treatment in 
West Bank hospitals.  In economic news, Al Ayyam's inside page 
reports that the Gaza closures might affect the cash transfer of 
salaries to Gaza banks for payment to Palestinian Authority (PA) 
employees.  According to the story, Israel has not yet responded to 
the PA request to send $47 million for that purpose. 
Al Ayyam leads with PLO satisfaction over the Arab foreign ministers 
meeting in Cairo.  Citing "agencies", the paper quotes PLO Executive 
Committee member Yasir Abd Rabbo describing decisions as, "in line 
with PLO positions" and he urged Hamas to accept them.  Al Quds 
front pages a Reuters story noting that the Arab foreign ministers 
declined to side with any of the conflicting Palestinian factions, 
and declined to directly blame Hamas for the collapse of Palestinian 
unity talks.  The ministers also expressed support for Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas to remain in office until new elections, 
the paper reports.  In a second front page story, Al Ayyam cites DPA 
when quoting Egypt's Foreign Minister Abu Al Ghayt describing the 
Cairo meeting as "fruitful" and noting that there was agreement on 
approaching the next U.S. administration with a new Arab vision for 
peace, to be presented in a paper prepared by the Arab foreign 
ministers. 
Al Hayat Al Jadida leads with, and all dailies front page, 
statements by Palestinian Authority President Abbas' and Italian 
President Napolitano, made during a joint press conference in 
Bethlehem on November 27.  Napolitano encouraged Palestinian 
leadership to continue efforts towards ending the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict and affirmed Italian support for 
negotiations.  Abbas called on Israel to halt its, "harsh and 
violent actions against Palestinians, including the continued 
construction of settlements, the separation wall and installation of 
checkpoints."  Abbas added that, "without a cessation of aggressive 
Israeli actions, peace can not be advanced in the region."  Al 
Ayyam's front page also quotes Abbas calling on president-elect 
Obama to adopt the Arab peace initiative as the basis for 
negotiations. 
All dailies report in front page pictures and stories about the 
opening of a trade fair in the West Bank city of Jenin by 
Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Fayyad, attended by Middle East 
Quartet representative Tony Blair on November 27.  In remarks, 
Fayyad reissued warnings that Israel's West Bank settlement policy 
is threatening peace and stability in the Palestinian Territories. 
Fayyad urged the international community to implement its declared 
positions and stop settlement activities.  Fayyad continued that his 
government is doing its utmost to enforce security and stability and 
working to end the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip.  He concluded 
by urging Israel to end its "siege" on Gaza, remove checkpoints and

all other restrictions on Palestinian movement, noting that they 
hamper the movement of goods and people, restricting the growth of 
the Palestinian private sector. 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page cites AFP in reporting on a rally by 
"American Jews" in West Jerusalem on November 27, held to demand the 
relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 
Al Ayyam's front page reports on a recent Israeli Government 
"regional master plan for Jerusalem," that allows for the expansion 
of illegal settlements while restricting Palestinian development. 
Lawyers representing dozens of Palestinian residents of East 
Jerusalem announced on November 27, intentions to challenge the plan 
in Israeli courts.  In background reporting, the paper notes that a 
Jerusalem "master plan 2000" was introduced in 2004 and criticized 
for excluding Palestinian input. 
Al Quds' inside page reports that foreign journalists continue their 
protest of Israel's ban on journalists to enter Gaza.  Steven 
Gutkin, Foreign Press Association head called the decision a 
violation of press freedom during a November 27 press conference and 
a joint letter to Israeli Prime Minister Olmert from ABC, BBC, CNN, 
AP and the NYT has been sent demanding access to Gaza.  The letter 
has gone unanswered, the paper reports. 
Thursday, November 27 
 
All front pages report that Israeli daily Ha'aretz revealed on 
November 26 that the Israeli military has been assassinating wanted 
West Bank Palestinians in violation of Israeli High Court 
guidelines.  In other military and settler news, Al Ayyam's front 
page reports that Israel's Defense Minister Barak stated that the 
Israeli military will implement Israeli High Court orders to 
evacuate Israeli settlers from the disputed Palestinian, Rajabi 
family home in Hebron.  Meanwhile, Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page 
and Al Ayyam's inside page report that Israeli settlers threw stones 
at Palestinians and slashed tires on 25 Palestinians cars in Hebron 
while settlers near Nablus attacked Palestinian ambulances, spray 
painting slogans of "death to Arabs." 
Al Ayyam's front page cited AFP when reporting that the Bush 
Administration has no intention of publishing a report written by 
U.S. envoy for Middle East Security General James Jones.  Analysis 
described the report as a "political bomb" noting that State 
Department Spokesman Robert Wood recently said that he has not aware 
of any plans to publish it.  The article continues that though a 
similar report by Jones about Iraq was published, there has been no 
explanation offered for why the report on Palestinian security will 
not be made public. 
 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida's front pages report that the UN and 
non-governmental agencies have made a combined appeal for $462 
million dollars to respond to the "humanitarian emergency caused by 
Israeli policies, such as West Bank settlements, the separation 
wall, and the blockade of Gaza." 
U.S. Consulate General Jerusalem activities are highlighted on 
inside pages of Al Quds and Al Ayyam.  The first report notes that 
cultural affairs staff visited Hebron University on November 26 to 
discuss cooperative projects, while the second report highlights the 
second annual career day/job fair for Palestinian university 
students, co-sponsored by the Consulate and local organization Young 
Entrepreneurs Palestine was held on November 25.  Al Ayyam reports 
that the USAID-funded Ruwwad program worked with local Juhud 
organization to distribute beehives to Palestinian farmers in 
Tulkarim and Ramallah villages.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
JERUSALEM 00002164  003 OF 003 
 
 
 
1)  Al Quds editorial is titled, "Confronting [Israeli] settlements 
is an international responsibility" (11/28):  "The settlement 
phenomenon relentlessly creeps forward to threaten not only the two 
state solution, but also the very existence of the Palestinian 
people on their land... we need more effective Palestinian action to 
internationally highlight the dangers of settlements and their 
destructive impact on the Palestinian existence... there is no doubt 
that settlements and settlement expansion are the reason for the 
freeze of the peace process... ending this cancerous phenomenon is 
the only way to realize a just, comprehensive and lasting regional 
peace." 
 
2)  Hamada Rajab Abu Saraya opines in Al Ayyam under the title, 
"Gaza Island"(11/28):  "Israel will continue remote monitoring of 
"security transgressions" in Gaza, but that tradition could change 
if more than food stuffs and humanitarian assistance were allowed to 
flow in both directions.  [For that to happen] Gaza would have to 
cease being a security threat to Israel, separate from Israel and 
the West Bank, and pose no security threat to Egypt.  As long as 
Gaza remained less than a state with no sovereignty over territorial 
waters, but with autonomous rule, the situation might even achieve 
regional goals, in addition to those of Israel."
