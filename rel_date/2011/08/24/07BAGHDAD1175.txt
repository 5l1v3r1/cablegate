BEGIN QUOTE: 
 
His Excellency the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
Esteemed Brother Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. 
 
Honorable Brother.. 
Greetings... 
 
I write this letter to your Excellency concerning the issue 
of the International Coalition Forces patrols in Shatt 
al-Arab which are being carried out at the request of the 
Iraqi Government to prevent oil smuggling which is the main 
source of the Iraqi Government budget. 
 
We hope your Excellency can show flexibility and tolerance 
with these patrols to enable them to perform their duties. 
On this occasion, I make this special request as an old 
forthcoming and allied brother of the Islamic Republic to 
release the (15) Britons with their equipment and weapons as 
a special favour to me personally which will strengthen my 
position vis-a-vis the Coalition. 
 
I avail this opportunity to renew to your Excellency and to 
the rest of the honorable brothers my sincere thanks for the 
kindness and affection you have shown during my illness. 
 
Please accept my utmost respect. 
Your Sincere Brother 
Jalal Talibani 
President of the Republic of Iraq 
2007-03-27 
END QUOTE. 
CROCKER
