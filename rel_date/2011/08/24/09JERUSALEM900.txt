Weekend stories: 
-------------- 
Sunday June 7: 
 
All front pages headlined, "Obama and Sarkozy:  Serious and 
constructive peace talks should lead to the establishment of two 
states - It's in Israel's interest to solve the crisis peacefully, 
while Palestinians should renounce violence and incitement." 
Coverage stressed that Presidents Obama and Sarkozy were in full 
agreement on many international issues when speaking during the 
joint press conference following their one-hour meeting on June 6. 
President Obama stressed the importance of breaking the stalemate in 
the Middle East peace process and called on all parties to realize 
that their fates are closely interconnected.  Coverage also noted 
that the European Union might impose restrictions on Israeli 
settlement products to add to growing U.S. pressure on Israel 
regarding settlement activities. 
 
All papers front paged comments by "official Israeli sources" that 
Israel will have no choice but to accept the two-state solution and 
the Roadmap, but should also insist on Israel's right to natural 
growth in settlements.  Noting that the comments come, "on the eve 
of" Special Envoy George Mitchell's visit to the region, reporting 
added that the sources said that it would be better for Israel to 
quickly announce its support for the Roadmap to ease American 
pressure regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state in the 
context of another plan. 
 
Saturday June 6: 
 
All front pages reported that, "Obama and Merkel stress the 
two-state solution- Palestinians and Israelis are asked to make 
'difficult choices' and resume negotiations."  The papers reported 
extensively on remarks made by the two leaders during their joint 
press conference on June 5.  Coverage also noted, "signs of 
disagreement and tension" emerging between Israel and President 
Obama over settlements and the two-state solution. 
 
All front pages reported that Secretary Clinton confirmed that there 
is no evidence of any agreement, informal or otherwise between 
Israel and the Bush administration about U.S. approval for natural 
growth in Israeli settlements.  Separate front page reporting in Al 
Ayyam announced that a "well-informed source" revealed that the U.S. 
is working on a plan to move the regional peace process forward. 
According to reporting, "early features" of the plan, which includes 
two-states for Israel and Palestine, might be discernable next 
month. 
 
Front pages also reported on the killing and wounding of 
Palestinians during the weekly "anti-wall" protests in Bil'in and 
Nil'in villages in the West Bank.  According to coverage, Bil'in 
protestors carried signs calling for a halt to Israeli settlement 
activities and calling on President Obama to, "move from words to 
action."  Reporting also carried comments by Palestinian Authority 
advisor for Jerusalem Affairs Abdil Qader calling on Palestinians to 
participate in large numbers at protest events.  Qader stressed that 
 
JERUSALEM 00000900  003 OF 003 
 
 
Palestinians will use all legal, political, and citizen-activist 
means possible to "foil" Israeli plans to expand the Jerusalem area 
Ma'ale Adumim settlement by annexing the nearby Kidar settlement.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Talal Okal opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title, 
"Obama is not a priest" (06/08):  "What is different about Obama's 
speech is that he did not refer to Hamas as a terrorist party, as if 
to offer it a second chance to join the [legitimate] political 
process... this is similar to the offer that Obama has made to Iran. 
 Hamas must now respond in an appropriate way that will keep the 
President enthusiastic about further change." 
 
2) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, 
"Unlimited right-wing greed"(06/08):  "Now that Obama has pinpointed 
the exact illness [Israeli settlement expansion], he should exert 
tremendous pressure on the greedy Israeli right-wing that is 
targeting all of the Palestinian Territories in an effort to 
transform them into settlements.  Then Obama's words and promises 
will become reality."
