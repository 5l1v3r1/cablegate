SUBJECT:  MUSIC VIDEO ON SUFFERING OF IRAQI NATION -- WITH LYRICS 
ATTRIBUTED TO DUBAI RULER 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: A music video on the suffering of the Iraqi nation 
with lyrics attributed to Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum 
(MbR), the Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of 
Dubai, is currently making the rounds in the Middle East.  The 
video, implicitly critical of U.S. policy, likens American soldiers 
to the Mongols who invaded Baghdad in 1258, but conveys a concluding 
message that expresses hope for the future of Iraq.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) An Iraq-themed music video entitled "The Shepherds and the 
Fire" is currently making the rounds in the Middle East.  The video 
first appeared approximately two weeks ago and is regularly featured 
on several Dubai-based Arabic language satellite channels.  What 
makes this video unusual is the fact that the lyrics are widely 
attributed to the Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al 
Maktoum.  The lyrics are sung by Kazem Al-Saher, an Iraqi singer who 
is currently one of the Arab world's most popular artists.  The 
video was produced in Dubai and lasts over eight minutes. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The lyrics and imagery of the video portray several 
primary themes.  The video opens with the pages of a book in flames. 
 The book seems to represent the theme of Iraqi "history" -- 
pervasive throughout the video.  It shows Iraq in antiquity and what 
appear to be Mongol invaders attacking ancient Baghdad.  It later 
shifts to brief clips of U.S. soldiers kicking in doors of houses 
and searching buildings.  It also shows Iraqi children playing 
soccer and then running away from approaching U.S. troops.  Sample 
lyrics include: "History has taught those who read it that 
oppression cannot last long."  "History has taught that strong 
countries have previously invaded and failed."  "No victory against 
Iraqis inside Iraq is possible." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) It is important to point out that brief segments of the 
video show bombs being prepared and suicide bombers donning 
explosive vests.  While those watching the video may get the 
impression that the video gives tacit approval to "resistance" 
operations in Iraq, the lyrics during these scenes proclaim "Victory 
is impossible as long as destruction continues" and proceed to 
depict scenes of destruction in Iraq.  The video does not condone 
the violence in Iraq, nor does applauding the insurgency appear to 
be its intent.  Its main orientation seems to be to place the crisis 
in Iraq in a kind of historical -- this too shall pass -- 
perspective. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The last theme is that of an Iraqi woman languishing in an 
Abu Ghraib-like prison, suffering abuse and harsh treatment from a 
uniformed female (apparently U.S. military) guard.  The anguished 
Iraqi woman appears to represent Iraq as a whole.  She is finally 
freed from her suffering and, running across a stretch of sand, 
finds an Iraqi flag buried in the sand.  Sample lyrics: "We were 
attacked without any evidence."  "There is no justification for 
those with ambition in Iraq."  "For every oppressor there is an 
end."  The video concludes with the Iraqi flag raised rippling in 
the air. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) While the video is strongly critical of the U.S., 
implicitly comparing U.S. soldiers to Mongol invaders, it seems to 
be calling for an end to violence, holding out a positive message 
for the future of Iraq.  As a whole the video seems to say that 
history shows that Iraq has been invaded before, but that the 
current anguish in the country will eventually pass and that in the 
end a free and victorious Iraq will emerge. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Post has a pending request to meet with MbR on another 
issue and will query him as to the attribution of the lyrics and the 
intent of the video.
