¶2.  "WAR GATE" IN SILOPI (SIRNAK) 
(Sabah)  Efforts are underway to open another border 
gate (with Iraq) in Silopi (Sirnak) to prepare 
possible after-effects in the event of a U.S. 
operation against Iraq.  The new gate, Ali Riza 
Efendi, will be used for the passage of between 250- 
500 (sic 250,000-500,000) expected refugees and 
munitions transport.  Upon advice from the Interior 
and Foreign Affairs Ministries, the State Ministry 
for Customs initiated the efforts and chose a 
location 15 kilometers south of Silopi for the 
proposed gate.  Officials said a bridge would also 
be constructed on the Tigris River for direct access 
to the gate. 
 
 
¶3.  U.S. MILITARY DELEGATION IN BATMAN 
(Milliyet)  Runway repair works have been completed 
in Batman, which is among military airports to be 
used during the possible U.S. operation against 
Iraq.  The runway, which was insufficient for 
warplanes, has been extended.  Reservations have 
been made in three- and four-star Batman hotels 
beginning in January for U.S. soldiers.  Three cold 
storages have been constructed on the Batman Air 
Base for use as morgues.  Cumhuriyet reported U.S. 
officials who surveyed hotels and hospitals in 
Batman four months ago continue with their 
inspections.  No measures have yet been taken in 
Diyarbakir. 
 
 
¶4.  TANKS ARE ON THEIR WAY 
(Milliyet)  While the proposed U.S. operation has 
entered Turkey's agenda, military activities 
intensified in the Southeast, where thermal cameras 
monitor borders 24 hours a day.  Additional units 
were sent to the borderline, with armored units 
finalizing their preparations.  Military vehicles 
transporting tanks were seen on the Diyarbakir- 
Mardin highway.  Tanks sent from Mardin, Sirnak, 
Cizre (Sirnak) and Silopi (Sirnak) to Diyarbakir's 
Seventh Corps Command for maintenance are now being 
transferred to their duty posts. 
 
 
¶5.  HAKKARI PREPARING FOR POSSIBLE IRAQI REFUGEES 
(Milli Gazete)  The Hakkari Health Directorate 
announced having completed its preparations for a 
possible influx of refugees (from northern Iraq) in 
case of a possible U.S. operation against Iraq.  The 
directorate will establish centers in Guzelkonak 
(Semdinli) and Uzumlu (Cukurca) villages to meet 
refugees' health-related needs.  Health Director Dr. 
Tahir Ersoz said 32 personnel who will serve in 
these centers had received one month of training at 
the Civil Defense Directorate.
