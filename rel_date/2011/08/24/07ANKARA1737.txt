could be made in the standardization of material in content 
and delivery. Progress continued in the development and 
standardization of the Internal Control Program, Commodity 
Identification Training and Second Line of Defense project. 
Additional focus was given to TNP development of detection

¶2.  Completed Actions for the Reporting Period 
 
¶A.  Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent Reporting 
Period 
 
1)  Jun 5 - EXBS Advisor met with Customs Enforcement Deputy 
Director General Mehmet Guzel to discuss recent Turkish 
Customs activities.  EXBS Advisor provided updated 
information concerning the Turkish Customs participation in 
CBP's International Rail Interdiction Training (IRIT) and 
International Air Cargo Interdiction Training (IACIT); also 
discussed was a Targeting and Risk Management (TRM) Workshop 
to be held in July, focusing on truck and vehicle traffic. 
EXBS Advisor added that the TRM trainers were available to 
remain in Ankara the week following training to work 
specifically with Turkish Customs HQ targeters on practices 
and procedures currently being utilized in the United States 
and in Turkey.  Guzel welcomed this additional possibility 
and would work quickly to get this approved by senior 
leadership. EXBS Advisor then discussed the schedule of 
meetings during the visit of a senior CBP training expert who 
will begin investigating areas of cooperation between the 
U.S. and Turkey in the development of the new Turkish Customs 
training academy.  Guzel again expressed appreciation for the 
large number of activities which will occur over the next few 
months and inquired again about the possibility of mid-level 
training for Customs officials in the areas of case 
management and incorporation of new technology.  He added 
that the more exposure Turkish Customs officials get to new 
methods, procedures and equipment, the more prepared they 
will be to perform their duties. 
 
2)  Jun 7-8 -  EXBS Advisor conducted departure briefing with 
Turkish Customs delegation traveling to the United States to 
participate in the International Rail Interdiction Training 
in El Paso Texas. 
 
3)  Jun 11-12 - EXBS Advisor accompanied CBP Training Expert 
Robert Hessler during an assessment of Turkish Customs 
Training Program.  The assessment was conducted at the 
headquarters and the training offices in Ankara; including 
meetings with officials in the EU and External Affairs 
Directorate, Customs Enforcement Directorate and Training 
Division.  The assessment determined that while the training 
program was adequate to provide officers and other Customs 
officials with the theoretical and legal knowledge needed for 
the basic level, it lacked actual practical exercises to 
supplement this training.  The assessment also concluded that 
while Turkish Customs use of guest instructors provides the 
new officers with information from actual field experience, 
the training lacks standardized curricula and delivery 
methods to get consistent training to each new officer.  It 
was determined that follow-on events could be of assistance 
to Turkish Customs Training Department in the development of 
standardized course material. A detailed report of the 
assessment is being developed by Mr. Hessler.

4)  Jun 15 -  EXBS Advisor met with MFA Arms Control and 
Disarmament Head of Department Serhan Yigit to discuss 
current projects in Turkey, including Internal Control 
Program (ICP), Customs Training and Second Line of Defense 
(SLD). EXBS Advisor inquired as to the latest information 
concerning the NP Cooperation Agreement.  Yigit replied that 
he needed to seek this information from the Agreements 
Division of MFA and would provide any update that he gets 
from them.  Yigit added that although some training is 
proceeding while we await these formalities, it will be good 
when we can place all the NP programs into full motion, 
including the delivery of equipment and the starting of the 
SLD upgrades.  EXBS Advisor agreed and then reviewed the 
activities that had and will occur between US and Turkish 
Customs, both training and visits. 
 
5)  Jun 19- 20 -  EXBS Advisor attended the Washington 
Program Managers meeting in Vienna, Austria. These meetings 
assisted in the facilitation of EXBS program planning, 
implementation and exchange of best practices among program 
advisors. 
 
6)  Jun 27 -  EXBS Advisor met with Turkish National Police 
Organized Crime Section Chief Mehmet Ali Keskinkilic to 
collect feedback concerning TNP's participation in FBI hosted 
Law Enforcement Workshop on Nuclear Terrorism.  Keskinkilic 
stated that the workshop was very beneficial and spotlighted 
many areas which Turkey needs to address in the preparation 
and prevention of these types of events.  He added that the 
practical exercises which were conducted brought into better 
focus the information that was being provided.  EXBS Advisor 
replied that exercise are a great way to identify areas of 
improvement along with areas of strength; adding that TNP 
could benefit from an exercise now to better identify needs 
and focus initial work lists.  Keskinkilic welcomed the idea 
and stated that he was intending to discuss this in an 
upcoming meeting with US FBI Liaison.  EXBS Advisor then 
provided Keskinkilic with latest Nuclear Smuggling Open 
Source Report, adding that it was important for us to 
continue to share information concerning anti-smuggling 
successes in order to make it a safer world. 
 
7)  Jun 27 - EXBS Advisor met with Turkish National Police, 
Counter Terrorism Division Assistant Director Ahmet Yayla to

the United States.  Yayla outlined the meeting to be held in 
Washington DC with officials from the Department of Energy 
and State Department concerning development of Turkey's 
Nuclear Detection and Response capabilities; he explained how 
from this information TNP will begin developing a plan. 
These meetings will be held prior to the DOE sponsored 
training in Richland, Washington for 24 TNP officials.  Yayla 
appreciated the assistance and provided information 
concerning the GOT's efforts to develop this capability and 
identified shortfalls.  EXBS Advisor added that TNP 
attendance at the FBI-sponsored Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism workshop in Miami was an excellent 
opportunity for Turkish officials to share experience and 
learn from other countries which have recently developed 
these capabilities.  Yayla agreed and added that he looks 
forward to working with the United States to continue to 
develop this unit. 
 
8)  Jun 28 -  EXBS Advisor met with Custom EU and External 
Relations Deputy Director General Ihsan Kocer to review past 
events and upcoming cooperation activities and schedules. 
EXBS Advisor provided a briefing on the significant findings 
of the training assessment completed earlier in the month. 
EXBS Advisor noted that while the report is still in its 
draft stages, it was observed that Turkish Customs overall 
has a sound training philosophy but could use assistance in 
standardizing some of the material presented to the new 
officers.  A more comprehensive review of the Turkish program 
needs to be completed which will include comparison of actual 
operations to training will need to be conducted to better 
 
ANKARA 00001737  003 OF 004
