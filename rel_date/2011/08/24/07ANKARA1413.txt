¶2.  Completed Actions for the Reporting Period 
 
¶A.  Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent Reporting 
Period 
 
1)  May 2 - EXBS Advisor met with Undersecretariat of Foreign 
Trade (UFT) Agreements Department Head Ziya Demirduzen to 
review the progress of the ICP project and to prepare for the 
next phase.  According to Demirduzen, UFT has been in contact 
with the local contractor, Docuart, and updates are being 
completed on the software.  Demirduzen added that the just 
completed ICP instructor training identified some other 
problems which are being corrected.  EXBS Advisor inquired 
about a possible Beta testing of the software in early June 
by select companies.  Demirduzen cautiously stated that this 
could be possible but there are many other obligations for 
his staff in June which may not allow this to occur.  EXBS 
Advisor also informed Demirduzen that funding was available 
for UFT to send two participants to the UGA Center of 
International Trade and Security Export Control Academy. 
Demirduzen welcomed this information and suggested that 
Turkish Customs could also benefit from participation.  EXBS 
Advisor stated that he would discuss this with MFA and 
Customs in the near future. 
 
2)  May 15 - EXBS Advisor met with Turkish National Police, 
Counter Terrorism Division Assistant Director Ahmet Yayla to 
discuss upcoming meetings and training for TNP officials. 
EXBS Advisor outlined the meeting to be held in Washington DC 
with officials from the Department of Energy and State 
Department concerning development of Turkey's Nuclear 
Detection and Response capabilities.  These meetings will be 
held prior to the DOE sponsored training in Richland, 
Washington for 24 TNP officials.  Yayla appreciated the 
assistance and provided information concerning the GOT's 
efforts to develop this capability and identified shortfalls. 
 EXBS Advisor added that TNP attendance at the FBI-sponsored 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism workshop in 
Miami will also be an excellent opportunity for Turkish 
officials to share experience and learn from other countries 
which have recently developed these capabilities.  Yayla 
stated that TNP intends to send a ten-person delegation to 
this workshop which they also believe will be very 
beneficial.  Yayla added that he looks forward to working 
with the United States to continue to develop this unit. 
 
3)  May 22 -  EXBS Advisor met with Customs Enforcement 
Deputy Director General Mehmet Guzel to discuss upcoming 
events and recent Turkish Customs activities.  EXBS Advisor 
provided Guzel with an update on the planning for the 
International Rail Interdiction Training. He also informed 
Guzel about other opportunities which were being offered for 
International Air Cargo Interdiction Training, Seaport 
Interdiction Training and RADACAD training.  Guzel welcomed 
these additional training opportunities and believes that 
Turkish Customs will benefit from attending them.  EXBS 
Advisor added that planning is almost complete for the 
Targeting and Risk Management Workshop which will be held in 
Ankara July 8 - 14.  Guzel then requested information on the 
possibility of mid-level management courses for Turkish 
Customs officials.  This training could focus on the 
processing of cases and the development of officials.  EXBS 
Advisor stated that this should be possible; he added that 
this issue should be addressed during the upcoming visit by 
CBP training expert. 
4)  May 24 -  EXBS Advisor met with MFA Arms Control and 
Disarmament Head of Department Serhan Yigit to discuss 
current projects in Turkey, including Internal Control 
Program (ICP), Customs Training and Second Line of Defense 
(SLD). EXBS Advisor presented Yigit with a proposal for an 
ICP prototype workshop in June.  Yigit accepted the proposal 
but doubted that it would be possible to coordinate on such 
short notice.  He added that he will coordinate with UFT and 
provide an answer.  EXBS Advisor then reviewed the activities 
that will occur between US and Turkish Customs, both training 
and visits.  Yigit commented that this increased engagement 
will be beneficial and a good way to build the working level 
cooperation between US and Turkey. 
 
5)  May 29 - EXBS Advisor met with Custom EU and External 
Relations Head of Department Hasan Kursuoglu to review 
upcoming cooperation activities and proposed schedules.  EXBS 
Advisor provided up dated information concerning the Turkish 
Custom participation in CBP's International Rail Interdiction 
Training (IRIT) and International Air Cargo Interdiction 
Training (IACIT); also discussed was a Targeting and Risk 
Management Workshop to be held in July, focusing on truck and 
vehicle traffic.  EXBS Advisor discussed the schedule of 
meetings during the visit of a senior CBP training expert who 
will begin investigating areas of cooperation between the 
U.S. and Turkey in the development of the new Turkish Customs 
training academy.  Kursuoglu expressed appreciation for the 
large number of activities which will occur over the next few 
months.  He added that the more exposure Turkish Customs 
officials get to new methods and procedures, the more 
prepared they will be to perform their duties.
