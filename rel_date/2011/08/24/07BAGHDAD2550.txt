SUBJECT: IRFFI DONORS DISCUSS TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) The Italian Embassy hosted an informal meeting of 
the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq 
(IRFFI) Donors Committee on July 31. Representatives from 
Donor countries were invited to review a draft report on the 
Terms of Reference (TOR), which were originally raised at the 
last IRFFI meeting in Istanbul. Comments on the TOR are due 
by September 10, and the final product is scheduled for 
release by September 30. A soft copy of the TOR will be sent 
separately. The next official IRFFI Donors Committee meeting 
will be held in Bari (Italy) October 29-30. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Earlier the same day, Donors Committee Co-Chair 
Gianludovico de Martino met with his Iraqi Ministry of 
Planning and Development Cooperation Co-Chair counterpart, 
Dr. Faik Al Rasol (on behalf of Minister Ali Baban), to 
discuss the draft TOR. Martino noted that the focus for IRFFI 
now would be a transition to an Iraqi-led reconstruction and 
development process. Emphasis has shifted to implementation, 
monitoring, evaluation and ensuring the sustainability of 
projects. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Member comments highlighted the need to avoid 
duplication of effort with the International Compact with 
Iraq (ICI). Currently, separate Secretariats for IRFFI and 
ICI are being developed, and all agreed that IRFFI should aim 
to complement the ICI. Additionally, IRFFI would solicit new 
monetary donations from Iraq's neighbors, namely the Gulf 
states.
