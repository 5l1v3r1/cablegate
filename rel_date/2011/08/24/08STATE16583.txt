RESPONSIBILITIES TO CYPRIOTS:  U.S. RESPONSE 
 
REF: ANKARA 279 
 
¶1. (U) This cable responds to Ref A's request for 
instructions. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ref A sought Department instructions for responding 
to the Turkish government's request for U.S. support in 
opposing plans of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) to transfer Search and Rescue (SAR) 
responsibilities in the Cyprus area from a UK Rescue 
Coordination Center (RCC) to the Cypriot Government's RCC. 
Embassy Ankara is instructed to advise GOT MFA civil aviation 
officials that the USG will not be able to support their 
opposition to ICAO's transfer of responsibility. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶3. (U) ICAO makes operational decisions based on efficiency, 
safety, and security, while avoiding judgments on sovereignty 
and political issues.  Cyprus is an ICAO Contracting State 
with current responsibility for SAR in the surrounding 
airspace.  The area administered by Turkish Cypriots in 
Cyprus does not have standing in ICAO.  Furthermore, the USG 
recognizes the Republic of Cyprus and not the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus.
