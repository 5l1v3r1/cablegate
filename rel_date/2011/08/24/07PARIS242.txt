SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR STAPLETON'S VISIT TO USS OAK HILL 
 
Â¶1. (U)  CDR Stapf and LTCOL Arentz, I feel privileged to have spent 
time with the fine Navy and Marine Corps team aboard Oak Hill.  The 
visit was first class, an excellent lunch and an outstanding tour of 
such a clean ship.  Particularly, I was impressed with the men and 
women I met, all with high morale and proud to be serving our 
country!  Thank you for introducing me to the "Gator" Navy.    I 
wish you safe sailing as you continue the deployment and may you 
safely return home to your loved ones.  Craig R. Stapleton, U.S. 
Ambassador to France.
