¶1. (SBU) On April 30, 2008,  Poloff presented U.S. priorities 
for the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) prepatory conference 
(PrepCom) on April 28 and May 9, 2008 in Geneva (ref A) to 
Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Chief of United 
Nations Division Azzedine Farhane, in the form of non-paper. 
Poloff also asked Farhane if the Government of Morocco (GOM) 
knew of any country, other than Zimbabwe, planning to table a 
candidate for the chairmanship of the 2009 NPT PrepCom, given 
current U.S. concerns about the government in Zimbabwe, and 
if the GOM would consider tabling their own candidate, per 
ref B. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Farhane told Poloff that he would forward the 
non-paper to his superiors and the Moroccan NPT-PrepCom 
delegation in Switzerland right away--given that the PrepCom 
is already in progress.  He also said that the choice of 
having Zimbabwe table a candidate for the chairmanship of the 
2009 NPT PrepCom was a decision of the Africa Group.  As 
such, he knew of no other country that was considering 
tabling a candidate for this position at this time.  He 
added, however, that he would forward the message of U.S. 
concern regarding Zimbabwe's candidacy to his superiors and 
the Moroccan PrepCom delegation immediately.
