¶1. (SBU) The GoF issued two statements, February 22 and 23, 
condemning the Al-Askariya Shrine bombing, and stressing the 
need for national reconciliation in Iraq (texts in paras 2 
and 3).  MFA DAS-equivalent for Iraq/Iran/Arabian Gulf 
Affairs Antoine Sivan told us the GoF statements were 
intended to express the GoF's firm and immediate condemnation 
of the February 22 attack in Samarra, while appealing for 
calm and national unity, and discouraging sectarian 
reprisals.  Sivan demurred when asked whether the GoF would 
consider assisting in the rebuilding of the Al-Askariya 
shrine, citing the GOF's secular tradition. 
 
¶2.  (U) The following is a text of the statement issued by 
the MFA February 22, 2006: 
 
France condemns with greatest firmness the attack this 
morning in Iraq that destroyed the mausoleum of imams in the 
town of Samarra. 
 
It is necessary to put an end to all actions that sow hatred 
and violence between communities and particularly those that 
involve places of worship. 
 
France calls on all Iraqis to come together in order to 
define their country,s future and put in place institutions 
that guarantee a place for all components of Iraqi society. 
 
¶3.  (U) On February 23, 2006, the MFA reemphasized its 
position with the statement below: 
 
France reiterates in the strongest possible terms its 
condemnation of the attack against the mausoleum of the two 
imams in Samarra. Our ambassador in Baghdad informed Prime 
Minister Ibrahim Jaafari and Ayatollah Sistani of the 
profound emotion of the French authorities and people. 
 
France condemns with the same firmness the increase in 
assassinations and deadly acts that took place yesterday 
against other religious sites, specifically Sunni, in the 
region of Baghdad. 
 
It offers the victims' families, the Iraqi authorities and 
the people its sympathy. 
 
It calls on Iraqis to renounce violence and mobilize to 
ensure the success of the political transition process. 
Today, more than ever, it is essential to restore a climate 
of confidence among Iraqis.
