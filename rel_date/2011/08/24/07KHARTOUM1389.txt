TALKS 
 
¶1. (SBU) An estimated 250 rebel fighters allied with the 
Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudan Liberation 
Army (SLA)/Unity struck a police installation in North 
Kordofan on August 29, resulting in the death of nearly 50 
policemen, according to a variety of credible Embassy 
sources.  It was the largest rebel attack associated with the 
conflict in Darfur to be launched in over eight months.  The 
UN and the AU condemned the incident, and the U.S. issued a 
similar condemnation on September 3, which was prominently 
features on page one of most Sudanese dailies.  Suleiman 
Jamous, the former SLA humanitarian coordinator and a 
political ally of both JEM and the SLA/Unity, also denounced 
the attack. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Lasting just two hours, the rebels launched the 
assault on a camp of the Central Reserve Forces in Wad Banda, 
south of Al Nahud, at 1500 hours local time.  Reports of the 
number of police fatalities ranges from 41 to 46, with 11 
wounded.  Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) stationed in the area 
pursued the attackers, killing between 20 and 50.  In eerily 
familiar comments during a later visit to the site, Minister 
of the Interior Al Zubeir Bashir Taha suggested that the 
Sudanese Government may arm the local population to "protect 
themselves."  A Khartoum-based association representing the 
area's inhabitants has challenged this proposal and plans to 
send a delegation to Wad Banda to discourage its inhabitants 
from taking up arms. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The attack represents a disturbing 
expansion of the Darfur conflict into neighboring Kordofan. 
SLA/Unity led by Abdullah Yehia--and estimated to be the 
strongest Darfur rebel movement--and the JEM faction led by 
Khalil Ibrahim issued a brazen claim of responsibility for 
the attack.  While both groups participated in the late-July 
Arusha conference as part of the UN/AU peace process, the 
incident calls into question ongoing UN/AU assertions of 
rebel support for the political process, particularly among 
the armed factions.  At the same time, JEM and SLA/Unity may 
be attempting to strengthen their hand prior to the start of 
UN/AU-sponsored negotiations in October.  Post anticipates 
that the Sudanese Government may launch a limited military 
offensive in response to the attack, under the auspices of 
improving security in North Kordofan.  End comment.
