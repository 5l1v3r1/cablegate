COUNCIL AGREES 
 
REF: TURNER/IO UNCLASS EMAIL: 11/19/09 2:27 PM 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  DPKO A/SYG Mulet requested continued 
Security Council support for MONUC's assistance to DRC army's 
(FARDC) "Kimia II" operation against the FLDR.  He said both 
military and political pressure were needed to address the 
FDLR threat, and outlined MONUC's plan to clear out the FDLR, 
hold gained ground, and build DRC's security sector capacity. 
 Mulet acknowledged the heavy humanitarian toll caused by the 
operations.  He said MONUC and the UN Office of Legal Affairs 
had issued a policy paper which stipulated MONUC's 
conditionality in its support to the FARDC.  All Council 
members encouraged MONUC to continue to support the FARDC in 
Kimia II, while calling for increased civilian protection. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
THE UN SAYS KIMIA II NEEDS MILITARY SUPPORT... 
 
¶2. (SBU) DPKO A/SYG Mulet briefed the Council on November 19 
in closed consultations on MONUC's involvement with the DRC 
army's (FARDC) "Kimia II" operation against the Hutu-rebel 
group FDLR in the Kivus (see ref. email for full briefing 
text).  Mulet stressed the need for continued MONUC 
participation in Kimia II, even though some UN bodies and 
many NGOs were calling for MONUC to withdraw its support.  He 
said military pressure is working and yielding concrete 
results. 
 
...WITHOUT PAUSE... 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mulet said that suspending MONUC support for the 
operation could encourage the FDLR.  He cited the October 19 
suspension of Kimia II to allow EUSEC to conduct a census on 
newly integrated combatants, which resulted in the FDLR 
attacking FARDC positions.  Mulet commented that the UN 
recognized that no lasting peace in eastern DRC could be 
established without addressing the presence of the FDLR. 
 
...AS WELL AS POLITICAL SUPPORT 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mulet noted that military action was not sufficient, 
and called for increased political pressure against the FDLR 
Diaspora, which funded and directed many FDLR activities in 
the Kivus.  Mulet acknowledged many grave human rights 
abuses, and expected more reports to come. 
 
MONUC'S PLAN-INCLUDES GREATER CONDITIONALITY 
 
¶5. (SBU) Mulet outlined MONUC's plan as: 1) help the FARDC 
clear areas of the FDLR; 2) assist the FARDC in holding areas 
taken through military operations; and 3) build capacity in 
the DRC security sector, especially in the east.  Mulet said 
that MONUC and the UN Office of Legal Affairs had written a 
policy paper which states, inter alia, that no UN support 
would be available to FARDC elements if there existed a 
substantial belief of a risk of human rights or other 
violations.  Mulet reported that the UN will send an 
inter-agency team to the DRC to explore how to best implement 
its conditionality policy with the FARDC. 
 
DRC AND RWANDA MUST DEFINE END STATE FOR FDLR, INCREASE DDRRR 
 
¶6. (SBU) Mulet said that the UN will work with both the GDRC 
and the Rwandan government to define the end state for 
addressing the FDLR issue.  He noted that at present there is 
no plan for when operations against the FDLR should end. 
Mulet also said that MONUC would enhance its efforts with the 
DRC and Rwanda to encourage disarmament, demobilization, 
repatriation, resettlement, and reintegration (DDRRR). 
 
COUNCIL SUPPORTS MONUC, CALLS FOR GREATER CONDITIONALITY 
 
¶7. (SBU) All Council members encouraged MONUC to continue to 
support the FARDC in Kimia II, and called for increased 
civilian protection.  Ambassador DiCarlo expressed support 
for MONUC's DDRRR efforts, and encouraged it to do even more. 
 She was joined by most members in calling for increased 
conditionality.  Austrian PermRep Mayr-Harting said MONUC's 
mandate renewal must be comprehensive and should include 
protection of civilian requirements from SCR 1894.
