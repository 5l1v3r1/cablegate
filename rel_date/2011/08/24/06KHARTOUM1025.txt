GNU Delays Analysis Needed to Confirm H5N1 Outbreak 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶1. (SBU) As previously reported, analysis of a human 
tissue sample conducted by U.S. Naval Medical Research 
Unit Number 3 (NAMRU-3) in Khartoum on April 22 found no 
evidence of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza.  Despite 
NAMRU-3's sustained efforts to support the Government of 
National Unity's (GNU) Ministry of Animal Resources 
(MoAR), the Ministry continues to refuse to authorize 
testing of animal samples using NAMRU-3's Polymerase 
Chain Reaction (PCR) machine, currently located at the 
GNU Ministry of Health (MoH).  USAID personnel do not 
believe that that the GNU would fail to authorize local 
testing of tissue samples if GNU ministries or local 
institutions had the capacity to perform laboratory 
analysis.  USAID is working with the United Nations to 
raise this issue to the highest levels of government in 
Khartoum. 
 
¶2. (U) Animal samples sent by the U.N. World Health 
Organization (WHO) in Khartoum to the World Organization 
of Animal Health (OIE) reference laboratory in Italy for 
confirmation of H5N1 avian influenza arrived in Rome on 
April 25.  The samples are currently delayed in Italian 
customs with clearance expected on May 1 or 2. 
WHO/Khartoum anticipates receiving test results from the 
OIE lab by May 5.

GNU Lacks Capacity to Respond to Avian Flu Outbreak 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) As the GNU refuses to approve local analysis of 
animal tissue samples, chickens continue to die in large 
numbers in poultry farms near Khartoum.  According to the 
U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), avian 
influenza type H5 recently decimated the entire 
population of a local farm containing more than 9,000 
chickens.  State authorities in Khartoum and Gezira are 
implementing containment measures in a 3 to 5 kilometer 
(km) radius surrounding infected farms.  However, FAO 
believes the rapid response capacity of Khartoum and 
Gezira States is limited by transportation and 
communication shortfalls. 
 
¶4. (U) Though an outbreak of the N1 strain of avian 
influenza has not yet been confirmed, local poultry 
producers are demanding a plan for government 
compensation for both the culling of poultry that has 
already taken place and for anticipated losses incurred 
as a result of the government's future attempts to 
contain the outbreak.  Despite these demands, the GNU has 
made no promises of compensation.  In a meeting with a 
small group of donors over a week ago, a representative 
of the MoAR declared the payment of compensation to 
farmers to be "un-Islamic." 
 
¶5. (SBU) An FAO poultry expert arrived in Khartoum on 
April 25.  She plans to visit a number of localities 
around Khartoum and Juba to conduct field assessments and 
educate local authorities during the duration of her time 
in Sudan.  The FAO consultant's primary responsibilities 
include assessing diagnostic capabilities at facilities 
operated by Sudan's MoAR, inspecting farms affected by 
the avian influenza outbreak, and briefing government 
officials and technicians on the results of her 
assessments.  On April 30, she met with USAID 
representatives to convey her initial impressions of GNU 
preparedness and response capacity to deal with the 
recent outbreak of avian influenza in Sudan.  USAID has 
asked the FAO consultant to organize a meeting to inform 
donors of the results of her assessments and to provide a 
general overview of the response required to contain this 
outbreak.  The meeting will be scheduled during the week 
of May 1. 
 
¶6. (SBU) The FAO expert's initial impressions of Sudan's 
preparedness and response capacities are not encouraging. 
 
The GNU's MoAR and MoH are not coordinating well despite 
the existence of a National Task Force to guide the 
government's response.  Given recent trends of widespread 
poultry deaths and the likelihood that the infecting 
strain is the N1 virus, the FAO expert is perplexed by 
the MoAR's refusal to authorize testing of animal samples 
at the MoH.  On the positive side, authorities in 
Khartoum and Gezira States know how to initiate a 
response to the threat posed by avian influenza and are 
trying to contain the virus by culling poultry as best 
they can.  State health authorities have improved local 
culling practices and now bury infected poultry on-site 
rather than transporting dead birds to sites outside 
infected areas. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Note:  Ms. Jagne, on assignment with FAO 
Khartoum until May 12, is a poultry disease specialist. 
Born in the Gambia, she is a naturalized American citizen 
who studied veterinary science at Cornell University and 
recently resigned from her job with ISA, a poultry 
company based in Ontario.  She is a U.S.-based expert who 
has worked on many avian influenza outbreaks in the US 
and Canada.  She is knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and a 
welcome injection into the FAO team in Khartoum.  It 
would be helpful if the USAID technical expert could 
arrive at post prior to her departure on May 12.  End 
note.

Update on USG Response 
---------------------- 
 
 
¶8. (U) The initial delivery of USAID-funded personal 
protective equipment (PPE) was delivered to the U.N. Food 
and Agriculture Organization and transferred to the MoAR 
on April 26, 2006.   An FAO poultry expert will work with 
the Ministry on the proper use and deployment of the PPE. 
An additional donation of 2000 sets of PPE is expected to 
arrive in Khartoum and Juba within the next 10 days.
