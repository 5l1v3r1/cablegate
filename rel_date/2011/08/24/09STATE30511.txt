In response to the reftel Leahy vetting request, the 
Department has reviewed its files and finds it does not, at 
this time, possess credible information of gross human rights 
violations by the members and units of the Lebanese Armed 
Forces and Lebanese Internal Security Forces listed in 
reftels.  If at any time the Embassy becomes aware of 
credible information that these individuals or units have 
been involved in gross human rights violations, the Embassy 
should so inform the Department.
