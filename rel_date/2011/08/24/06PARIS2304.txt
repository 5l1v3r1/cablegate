SUBJECT: FRANCE ON WMD PROLIFERATOR FINANCING 
 
 
(SBU) Following up on Treasury U/S Levey,s letter about 
coordinating a multinational effort to combat the financial 
underpinning of WMD proliferation and suggesting that France 
consider sponsoring or co-sponsoring a regional conference 
with certain European countries, on April 6 we spoke with 
David Bertolotti at the MFA office of disarmament and nuclear 
nonproliferation.  Bertolotti said a written reply is still 
not finished, but would be forthcoming.  The substance of the 
reply will be that France shares USG objectives and concerns, 
and would be willing to consider a regional conference, but 
first would like to have another bilateral meeting with the 
USG.  At that bilateral meeting, a working group could take 
up a series of questions raised by the proposal.  France 
mainly would like to consider how to best integrate this new 
initiative into existing institutions and agreements, and 
compare the legal tools available.  Given that the G8 is 
likely to take up this issue in July, Betolotti added that it 
would be better to arrange this bilateral meeting soon, and 
officials would be prepared to hold it either in Paris or in 
Washington.
