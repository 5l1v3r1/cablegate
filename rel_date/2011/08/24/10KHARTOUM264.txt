¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Southern People's Liberation Movement 
(SPLM) became embroiled in crisis following the February 22 
announcement of candidates that will be the party's standard 
bearers in the upcoming April elections.  Upon learning that they 
were not selected, a number of senior SPLM members decided to defy 
the party and run as "independents" (SPLM-I).  The SPLM has tried 
to both cajole and threaten members back into the fold.  However, 
this point, thirteen independents continue to contest various 
governorships.  The SPLM remains concerned about this split in 
party cohesion and its effect on electoral security.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On February 9, ConGen and PolOff met with SPLM Deputy 
Secretary General Anne Itto concerning the party's "independent" 
candidates. At that time, there were 13 independent candidates 
running for gubernatorial seats for the 10 states of Southern 
Sudan, including three in Upper Nile State alone. Scores of other 
SPLM independents were running for the Southern Sudan Legislative 
Assembly (SSLA) and State legislatures. Although the SPLM gave them 
a February 13 deadline to withdraw their nomination or leave the 
SPLM, there had been no public withdrawals as of February 15. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Itto explained that the nomination process had been very 
difficult.  The SPLM political bureau (PB) received 76 SPLM 
nominations for the 10 gubernatorial seats and 2,800 for the 700 
parliamentary seats from the State "electoral colleges."  (Note: 
These colleges were State-led committees charged with vetting 
candidates against standardized criteria.  However, many blame the 
colleges for not recommending the strongest candidates to the 
political bureau). 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to Itto, the 27 members of the PB pored over 
the nominations, reviewed them based on the standardized criteria 
and finally decided through secret ballots.  She said that even 
some of the people GoSS President Kiir supported were not selected. 
Itto acknowledged that the process had thrown the party into 
disarray.  However, she maintained that it had been fair and 
transparent.  She stated that given the numbers of nominees alone, 
it was inevitable that there would be a lot of unhappy people. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Other party members have been far more critical of the 
nomination process.  Numerous cabinet-level members of the GoSS 
have told us, "we have put ourselves in a mess."  Not surprisingly, 
GoSS VP Riek Machar was the most disparaging, terming the process a 
"fiasco."  (Comment:  This may in part be due to the fact that 
there were only two Nuer candidates for the 10 gubernatorial slots. 
The party leadership has been livid that one of the SPLM-I 
gubernatorial candidates is Angeline Tenny Machar, wife of the VP).

¶6.  (SBU) Immediately following the independent candidates' 
announcements to contest the elections, the SPLM Secretary General, 
Pagan Amun was quoted as saying they would be expelled from the 
party. However, others urged the party try to "convince" them to 
stand down for the good of Southern Sudan and in the interests of 
party discipline. Still others argued that the party should let the 
independents run, and if successful, accept them back into the fold 
afterwards, thereby creating a stronger party in their view. 
 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) On February 6, GoSS President Salva Kiir and SPLM 
 
Secretary General Pagan Amun convoked all the independent 
candidates to Juba.  Itto told us that in exchange for their "party 
loyalty" the President and Secretary General told them they would 
be considered for other senior postings in the Government of 
Southern Sudan.  Kiir and Amun also reminded them that these 
postings were temporary and there would likely be new elections 
soon following the referendum.  Minister of Regional Cooperation 
Oyai Deng Ajak told us that Kiir had intended to meet with the 
independents separately, but they refused and requested to meet as 
one group.  In the end, the SPLM gave the candidates one week to 
reconsider or risk party expulsion.  As of February 13, the week 
end deadline, no candidates had publicly withdrawn their 
nomination.

Comment

¶8.  (SBU) The SPLM remains conflicted about elections.  Numerous 
senior-level officials have floated with us the possibility of 
delaying the process.  In the South, the SPLM fears the party is 
being undermined by ethnic cleavages and personal ambition.  While 
it is unlikely that the National Congress Party (NCP) will make 
serious headway against the SPLM, it is possible that these 
internal party divisions will cause it to lose ground vis-????-vis 
other Southern political parties. 
 
 
 
¶9. (SBU) Concerning its presidential nominee, Yasir Arman, the SPLM 
is fully aware that it has waged a high-stakes bet.  Over the past 
few weeks the NCP has made numerous overtures to the SPLM, pledging 
resolution of outstanding issues related to the Comprehensive Peace 
Accord (CPA), in exchange for "partnership" on the presidential 
nominee. i.e. withdrawal of Arman's candidacy.  However, thus far, 
the SPLM is standing by Arman. 
 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Notwithstanding the misgivings that the some SPLM 
members have about elections, the electoral process has its own 
clear momentum.  Voters have registered and candidates are 
mobilized.  With each passing day, elections become more likely. 
At this juncture a delay, or the withdrawal of Arman, would be 
difficult to explain to the population.  We have hewed to the line 
that elections are an important component of the CPA and 
democratization process and should go forward.  End Comment.
