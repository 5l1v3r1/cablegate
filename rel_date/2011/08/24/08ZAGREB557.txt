PolCouns discussed the upcoming NAM Ministerial in Tehran 
with Neven Mikec, chief of staff to the Foreign Minister. 
Mikec said that Croatia was well aware of the sensitivies 
involved in the meeting in Tehran.  He said that Croatia 
would only be represented as an observer at the meeting by 
its resident ambassador in Tehran, Esad Prohic.  Given 
Croatia's current membership of both the IAEA Board of 
Governers and the UNSC, the GoC is well aware of the current 
state of issues between Iran and those bodies, and is 
supportive of efforts to get Iran to meet its obligations.
