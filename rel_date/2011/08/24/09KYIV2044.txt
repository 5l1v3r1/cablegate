¶1.  (SBU) We delivered ref A points November 16 to the MFA's 
Directorate for Arms Control and Military Technical 
Cooperation, and followed up with ref B points on November 23 
to Viktor Shkuro in the MFA's Department of Economic 
Cooperation.  Shkuro explained that several MFA departments, 
as well as the Ministry of Energy, have a role in this issue, 
although his department has the coordinating function.  He 
added that Russia has also requested Ukrainian support for 
the Angarsk project.

preparing instructions for the Ukrainian mission in Vienna to 
co-sponsor the draft resolution on Angarsk.
