SUBJECT: JAPANESE STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR IRAQI-UN LAUNCH 
OF INTERNATIONAL COMPACT WITH IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 124125 
 
 ¶1.  (U)  Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso on July 28 made 
the following statement of support for the Iraqi-U.N. launch 
of the International Compact With Iraq. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
¶1.  On Thursday, July 27, the Government of Iraq and the 
United Nations issued a press release that announced the 
formal launch of the International Compact with Iraq to build 
a new partnership between Iraq and the International 
Community. 
 
¶2.  Japan has been consulting on this Compact with Iraq, the 
U.N., and other major donors for the reconstruction of Iraq. 
This document is anticipated to describe policy goals of the 
Government of Iraq for the next five years in the aspects of 
political affairs, security and economic reconstruction, as 
well as the commitment of the international community to 
providing Iraq with assistance for achieving those goals. 
Japan will actively and continuously support the efforts of 
the Iraqi people for nation-building, and welcomes the formal 
launch of the Compact at this time. 
 
¶3.  Japan hopes that Iraq will develop as a democratic and 
stable state and prosper as a responsible member of the 
international community.  Japan considers that the Compact 
will contribute to accelerating the reconstruction of Iraq by 
making clear the future responsibility of the Government of 
Iraq for its governance and by broadening the range of the 
donors in the international community.  Japan will actively 
participate in such an initiative as a member of the 
Preparatory Group of the Compact. 
 
¶4.  The Ambassador in Charge of Reconstruction Assistance to 
Iraq assumes charge of coordination regarding the Compact.
