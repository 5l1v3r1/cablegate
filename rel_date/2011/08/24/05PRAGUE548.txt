On April 15 we discussed the Czech Republic's position on 
membership in OECD for Russia with Vladimir Dolejsi, an 
officer in the Department of Multilateral Relations in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Dolejsi confirmed that the 
Czech Republic remains convinced that the time for Russia's 
membership in the OECD is "not right".  The Czechs support 
expanded economic cooperation with Russia, Brazil, India and 
China, and have been active in discussions on reform of trade 
regulations in those countries  within the OECD, Dolejsi 
said.  He added that Prime Minister Stanislav Gross responded 
in March of this year to a letter from Russian Prime Minister 
Fradkov seeking Czech support for OECD membership, telling 
Fradkov that while the Czech Republic recognizes Russia's 
membership as an ultimate goal, the Czech Republic is not 
prepared at this time to support its immediate entry into the 
organization as a full member.
