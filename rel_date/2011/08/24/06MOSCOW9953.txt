SUBJECT: RUSSIA NONCOMMITTAL ABOUT FIVE PLUS FIVE MEETING 
AT UNGA 
 
REF: STATE 143310 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  After providing reftel talking points to the MFA 
earlier, we checked with MFA North America on September 8 to 
see whether FM Lavrov would attend a meeting of the Five Plus 
Five on the margins of the upcoming UN General Assembly 
meetings.  We were told that no decision had been made about 
Lavrov's participation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In a September 7 meeting with MFA First Asia 
Department Senior Counselor Oleg Davydov, who advises DFM 
Alekseyev on North Korean issues, we raised GOR participation 
in the meeting.  Davydov was aware of the request, was 
noncommittal about GOR attendance, and asked whether we knew 
whether other invitees had accepted.  Poloffs noted that we 
did not know whether all invitees had accepted.
