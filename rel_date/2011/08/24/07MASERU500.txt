¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On August 14, three of the six Lesotho 
nationals accused of coup plotting in Lesotho, and reportedly 
granted political asylum in South Africa, walked free from a 
magistrate court in Gauteng Province after posting bail.  Crowds 
of their supporters, bused in from Maseru, packed the courtroom. 
 On August 15, the Lesotho Mounted Police Service (LMPS) named 
six additional Basotho individuals, including the former 
commander of the defunct Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA), as 
wanted in connection with June 2007 attacks on GOL ministerial 
residences.  The presence of figures such as All Basotho 
Convention (ABC) Leader Thomas Thabane at the Gauteng Province 
trial indicates that the fate of those accused of "coup 
plotting" and living in self-imposed exile in South Africa will 
continue to be a hot political topic in the Mountain Kingdom and 
may have interesting implications for the South Africa-Lesotho 
bilateral relationship.  END SUMMARY.

South Africa Releases Three Accused 
 
By Lesotho of "Coup Plotting" on Bail 
 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) According to local political and media sources, on August 
14 three of the six Basotho men accused of "coup plotting" in 
Lesotho who sought political asylum in South Africa (ref B) 
appeared before the Sebokeng Magistrate Court in Gauteng 
Province, South Africa.  South African police apparently 
arrested Khotso Lebakeng, Phakiso Semoli, and Elias Motlomelo 
subsequent to an arrest and extradition request from the Lesotho 
Mounted Police Service (LMPS) which cited them and three others 
for charges including armed robbery, attempted murder, and 
unlawful possession of rifles.  The South African court granted 
the men bail and warned them not to leave the country.  Each of 
the three posted bail of 4,750 rand (approximately $680) and are 
expected to reappear in court on September 18.  The magistrate 
stated that the court required this time to review documents 
relating to Lesotho's extradition request and the men's 
political asylum applications.  The whereabouts of the other 
three accused "coup plotters" who fled to South Africa -- 
Makotoko Lerotholi, Mokherane Tsatsanyane, and Thabo Thants'i -- 
are unknown. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) The families of Lebakeng, Semoli, and Motlomelo chartered 
several buses to transport supporters of the three men from 
Maseru to South Africa for the August 14 court appearance. 
According to Embassy contacts, these supporters filled the court 
to capacity, and included Thomas Thabane, the principal leader 
of Lesotho's political opposition; and Attorney Hae Phoofolo, a 
well-known Mosotho human rights lawyer.  Part of the proceedings 
was carried live by Lesotho's politically-oriented religious 
radio station Harvest FM.

¶4. (U) On August 15, the LMPS issued a press release naming an 
additional six men wanted in connection with the June 2007 
attacks on GOL ministerial residences (ref D).  The statement 
listed the following men as wanted by the LMPS: Lits'itso 
Sekamane (former Member of Parliament and former Commander of 
the defunct Lesotho Liberation Army (LLA, ref A)); Thabiso 
Mahase (former LLA member and estranged husband of High Court 
Judge Mahase - ref C); Shadrack Chakela (traditional musician); 
Lefa Ramantsoe; Tlala Lets'olo; and a South African citizen by 
the name of "Alex" (no further information available).  The LMPS 
appealed to the public to provide information concerning the 
whereabouts of the six men.

Shifting Charges Engender Skepticism

¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  The fact that Lebakeng, Semoli, and Motlomelo 
are under extradition threat for charges that were never leveled 
against them in Lesotho (where they are charged solely with high 
treason) has engendered skepticism in Lesotho's opposition 
circles.  Two names on the LMPS's new list of individuals wanted 
in connection with the June 2007 attacks on ministerial 
residences are well known former LLA members, a pattern of 
association with the former insurgent group noted in previous 
reporting (ref A).  The presence of figures such as All Basotho 
Convention (ABC) Leader Thomas Thabane in Gauteng Province for 
the trial of Lebakeng, Semoli, and Motlomelo indicates that the 
fate of those accused of "coup plotting" and living in 
self-imposed exile in South Africa will continue to be a hot 
political topic in the Mountain Kingdom and may have interesting 
implications for the South Africa-Lesotho bilateral 
relationship.  END COMMENT.
