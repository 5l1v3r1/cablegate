¶1.  (SBU) We met with Tubitak Uzay Director Ugur Murat 
Leloglu on August 28 to discuss reftel Blue Lantern cases 
associated with Tubitak Uzay's RASAT Remote Sensing Satellite 
Project.  Leloglu was forthcoming and eager to cooperate with 
our inquiry.  We confirmed that Tubitak Uzay has received the 
couplers (Case Number 05-050022026), but has nQyet received 
tQRadiation Tolerant Field Programmable Gate Arrays (Case 
Number 05-050044473), as it is part of the remote sensing 
camera that Tubitak Uzay had ordered, but not yet received, 
from its South Korean partner, SATREC.  Upon our request, 
Leloglu produced a list of major components for the camera. 
The list included "Radiation Tolerant Field Programmable Gate 
Arrays."  The model number listed was identical to the one 
listed in reftel, except the model number ended with an "E, 
whereas the model number listed in reftel ended with a "B." 
According to Leloglu, Tubitak Uzay is expecting delivery of 
the camera from South Korea later this month.  Leloglu has 
pledged to inform us when the camera arrives. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Regarding the launch site for the satellite, 
Leloglu noted that his institution had been in negotiations 
with Kazakh satellite launch company Baikonur until very 
recently, but those negotiations broke down due to concerns 
over cost and timing.  Subsequent to the collapse of talks 
with Baikonur, Tubitak Uzay had sent a message in early 
August to all companies capable of launching satellites to 
determine which company can meet its launch window of late 
2008 to early 2009.  Tubitak Uzay has received a positive 
response only from French aero-space firm Arianespace, with 
which Tubitak Uzay has begun negotiations.  However, Leloglu 
noted that the Indian firm Antrix had also responded to 
Tubitak Uzay's inquiry by requesting additional technical 
details on the satellite. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) We reminded Leloglu about ITAR regulations 
prohibiting the re-transfer or re-export of USML components 
without express USG authorization, as well as standing USG 
policy prohibiting the launch of satellites containing USML 
components from India or China.  Leloglu indicated that 
Tubitak Uzay plans to use Arianespace to launch the 
satellite, but asked whether there is a process to seek U.S. 
authorization to launch the satellite from India should all 
other options fail.  We reiterated USG policy and discouraged 
Leloglu from exploring the possibility of an exemption.
