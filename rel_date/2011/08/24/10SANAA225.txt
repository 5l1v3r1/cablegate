SUBJECT: YEMEN: 2009 CHILD LABOR AND FORCED LABOR UPDATES 
 
REF: A. STATE 131997 
     ¶B. 09 SANAA 104 
 
¶1. This cable provides updates on the child and forced labor 
situation in the Republic of Yemen, as per REF A.  Hard copy 
source materials for 2009 have been pouched to the Department 
of Labor Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor and Human 
Trafficking (OCFT).  POC is Roland McKay: mckayrd@state.gov, 
Tel: 967 1 755 2152, and Fax: 967 1 303 182. 
 
¶2. Post has no evidence of child or forced labor being used 
in the production of goods in Yemen.  EmbOffs spoke to local 
and international child labor-oriented NGOs, as well as the 
Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, and found no reports of 
such labor being used in the very limited Yemeni 
manufacturing sector. 
 
¶3. The child labor situation in Yemen has not changed 
significantly since January 2009; many of the challenges 
mentioned in REF B remain true today.  Deputy Minister for 
Social Affairs and Labor Shaif al-Sagheer told EconOff on 
January 26 that the Parliament had still not passed a draft 
"Child Law" that would give enforcement teeth to existing 
legislation.  As of late January 2010, the lack of child 
labor inspectors (REF B) remained a significant obstacle in 
the ROYG's ability to combat child labor effectively.
