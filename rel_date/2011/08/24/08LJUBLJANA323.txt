SUBJECT: SLOVENIAN RESPONSE FOR JULY 22-23 GAERC 
MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 75702 
 
¶1. (SBU) On July 17, Emboffs met with Aljaz Arih, 
Head of the CFSP Unit at the MFA, to deliver reftel 
points in advance of the July 22 - 23 for the 
General Affairs and External Relations Council 
(GAERC) meeting. 
 
IRAN 
---- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Per reftel, Emboff urged the Government of 
Slovenia (GOS), as an EU member state, to act on UN 
Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1803.  Arih 
responded by stating that although draft text is 
currently in the working group, it is unlikely that 
a text will be adopted for the EU Common Position at 
the July 22-23 GAERC meeting.  He did note, however, 
that Solana will brief the foreign ministers on the 
July 19 P5+1 meeting in Geneva.  Arih expects the 
text for the EU Common Position to go beyond mere 
adoption of UNSCR 1803 by calling for additional 
measures against Iranian banks and by encouraging 
inspections of cargo transported by Iranian 
companies beyond those cited in 1803.  He cautioned, 
however, that the final text will depend on the 
results of the July 19 P5+1 meeting.  Arih noted 
that the GOS is pleased that Undersecretary of State 
for Political Affairs William Burns will be 
attending the meeting in Geneva. 
 
SOMALIA 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Arih stated that the GOS supports U.S. 
positions on Somalia and advocates an inclusive 
approach to addressing the humanitarian crisis. 
Regarding the adoption of UNSCR 1816, Arih noted 
that the EU is currently working on how it can 
contribute to a joint interdiction operation with 
the multi-national Combined Task Force (CTF).  Arih 
said that possible EU contributions could be an ESDP 
operation or individual contributions by EU member 
states to the CTF. 
 
CHAD/SUDAN/DARFUR 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Arih stated that the main purpose of the 
Chad agenda item will be to discuss the Chad ESDP 
mission.  He noted that the mission is approximately 
halfway through its one-year term and the GAERC will 
discuss the coming transition to a UN force.  Noting 
that the situations in Sudan and Chad are closely 
linked, Arih stressed the importance of a political 
dialogue between Sudan and Chad as well as political 
agreement between the government of Chad and 
opposition groups. 
 
ZIMBABWE 
-------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Arih agreed that stronger measures were 
needed in Zimbabwe and relayed that an agreement was 
reached between EU member states on a sanctions 
package to be adopted at the July 22-23 GAERC 
meeting which will strengthen travel bans and asset 
freezes.  Arih noted that the GOS is disappointed 
the UNSC was unable to act on a clear violation of 
human rights and democracy in Zimbabwe.  He stated 
that the main elements of the anticipated GAERC 
conclusions on Zimbabwe are non-recognition of the 
election results as legitimate, further measures 
against the Mugabe regime, support for South African 
Development Community (SADC) efforts, and emphasis 
upon the necessity of negotiations. 
 
UKRAINE 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Arih said that although the GOS favors the 
promotion of a European perspective in Ukraine, not 
all EU member states agree.  Arih mentioned that the 
GOS supports the establishment of an association 
 
LJUBLJANA 00000323  002 OF 002 
 
 
agreement with Ukraine, but again noted the lack of 
consensus amongst EU member states on the way 
forward with Kyiv.  Arih also stated that the GOS 
supports establishing a visa dialogue with Ukraine. 
 
THE BALKANS 
----------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Although not raised by Emboff, Arih 
imparted some additional comments with respect to 
the Western Balkans.  Arih said that Slovene Foreign 
Minister Dmitri Rupel will address the GAERC meeting 
to speak about the political situation in Serbia 
following the formation of a new government.  Rupel 
will provide an analysis linking the new government 
with the situation in Kosovo, and discuss possible 
next steps for the EU.  Arih noted that the GOS is 
concerned about the international community?s 
presence on the ground in Kosovo and the postponed 
transition from UNMIK to the EULEX mission.  He 
stated that the GOS hopes the UN Secretary General 
will provide greater clarity on the situation in the 
coming days. 
 
Transatlantic Relations 
----------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) Arih stated that Portuguese Foreign 
Minister Luis Amado recently sent a proposal to all 
EU Foreign Ministers to have a discussion at the 
July 22-23 meeting on strategies to improve 
transatlantic relations.  However, Arih did not 
expect there will be much discussion about the 
proposal at the July GAERC, but that it will most 
likely receive more attention at the next Gymnich in 
September. 
 
Georgia 
------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Arih stated that German Foreign Minister 
Frank-Walter Steinmeier will report to the GAERC on 
his recent visits to Tbilisi, Moscow and Sukhumi. 
Arih expected discussion over a German package 
proposal that aims to ease political tensions over 
Abkhazia.
