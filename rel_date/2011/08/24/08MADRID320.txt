Â¶1. (U)  Embassy made a strong case for the EU Presidency and 
Spain to issue statements regarding the Iran elections per 
reftel demarche.   Alberto Ucelay, Deputy Director for Middle 
East Affairs at the Spanish MFA, said that they would 
consider our points, particularly with regard to the need for 
transparency.  Spain will work within the EU context on this 
issue.  Ucelay said that Spain shares our concerns about the 
fundamental flaws in Iran's electoral process.  He 
anticipates there will be an EU statement that conveys a 
similar message, but he could not say when it would be 
issued.
