¶1. (SBU) On April 1 we delivered reftel request to Randolf 
Coto, Acting Deputy Director General of the Foreign Policy 
Division of the MFA and to Carlos Cordero Madrigal, Director 
of the Disarmament, Terrorism and Organized Crime section of 
the MFA.  Coto and Cordero thanked us for the information and 
indicated that the final authority on these issues would be 
Mario Zamora, Director General of the Immigration Department 
of the GOCR.  We will meet with Zamora on April 8 to discuss 
the request. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Separately, visiting WHA DAS Kirsten Madison raised 
the issue on April 1 with President Oscar Arias.  Madison 
thanked Arias for Costa Rica's history of accepting Cuban 
migrants and informed him that even more migrants needed 
homes.  Arias was noncommittal, but seemed pleased that we 
recognized the GOCR's past support.
