¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On December 31, a Jakarta court acquitted 
former intelligence official Muchdi Purwoprandjono of 
conspiracy to commit the September 2004 murder of human 
rights activist Munir Said Thalib.  The Court stated that the 
prosecution had failed to tie Muchdi to the murder.  The GOI 
pushed the case hard and prosecutors plan to appeal.  The 
decision is a setback for human rights activists who have 
demanded accountability.  Suggested press guidance is 
attached in para 7.  END SUMMARY. 
 
VERDICT IN MUNIR CASE 
 
¶3.  (U) A Jakarta District Court has acquitted Muchdi 
Purwoprandjono, the former deputy chief of the Indonesian 
National Intelligence Agency (BIN), for conspiracy in the 
murder of Munir, a well-known human rights activist.  In its 
decision, the presiding judge said there was "insufficient 
evidence" to prove that Muchdi was involved in the murder. 
Specifically, the judge said, "Prosecutors failed to 
demonstrate that Muchdi had motive to commit murder or that 
he used his power as BIN chief to kill Munir."  (Note: 
Pollycarpus Priyanto was convicted and sentenced to 20 years 
in prison for carrying out the murder.  He is now in prison, 
serving his sentence.) 
 
¶4.  (U) Prosecutors plan to appeal the decision.  Under 
Indonesian law, the prosecution has the ability to appeal 
adverse court rulings, the same right accorded the defense. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The crux of the prosecution's case centered on 
painting Muchdi as the key conspirator in "masterminding" the 
murder plot.  From the beginning, the prosecution asserted 
that Muchdi had a clear motive to murder Munir.  They alleged 
that Muchdi was dismissed from his position as head of the 
Army Special Forces (KOPASSUS) after an investigation led by 
Munir revealed Muchdi's involvement in the disappearance of 
13 human rights activists in 1997-98.  Defense lawyers 
strongly attacked the prosecution's allegations.  In his 
decision, the presiding judge cited what he said was the 
prosecution's failure to make a direct connection between 
Muchdi and Pollycarpus. 
 
ACTIVISTS SEE A SETBACK 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Human rights activists were not happy with the 
verdict, seeing it as a setback for accountability.  One 
activist told poloff that the acquittal was "a serious 
setback in human rights enforcement" for Indonesia.  This 
activist claimed to poloff that several witnesses were under 
enormous pressure and withheld testimony.  That said, the GOI 
did press the case hard and, as noted, plans to lodge an 
appeal. 
 
SUGGESTED PRESS GUIDANCE 
 
¶7.  (U) Suggested press guidance follows: 
 
Q:  What is the U.S. reaction to the December 31 Indonesian 
court decision in the Munir murder case? 
 
A: 
--The United States closely monitored the progress of the 
Muchdi trial and the investigation of Munir Said Thalib's 
murder. 
--In the aftermath of the verdict, we hope the Indonesian 
government will continue its investigation into Munir's 
murder and continue its pursuit of justice. 
--We urge the GOI to ensure that justice is served, wherever 
 
JAKARTA 00002354  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
the evidence may lead, and that the process be transparent, 
independent, and professional.  We hope all those complicit 
in Munir's murder will be brought to justice. 
--Background:  Internationally respected Indonesian human 
rights activist Munir was murdered while on a Garuda airlines 
flight from Jakarta to Amsterdam in September 2004. 
According to an autopsy, Munir died of arsenic poisoning. 
There has been widespread speculation that Indonesia's 
intelligence agency (BIN) was involved in Munir's killing. 
On December 31, 2008, a Jakarta court acquitted former 
intelligence official Muchdi Purwoprandjono of conspiracy to 
commit the murder.
