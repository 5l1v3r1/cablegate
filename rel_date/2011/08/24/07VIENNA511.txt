SUBJECT: AUSTRIA REQUESTS CLARIFICATION OF BAGHDAD RAID ON 
VIENNA NGO 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On February 26, Peter Launsky, Head of the Austrian 
MFA's Citizen Services Division passed DCM an Aide Memoire 
requesting USG clarification regarding an alleged raid by 
U.S. Armed Forces on the Baghdad offices of the Vienna-based 
NGO "Irakisches Hilfswerk in Oesterreich" February 18. 
According to the Aide Memoire, the raid took place in a 
multi-story building in the Mansur district of Baghdad and 
also targeted other NGOs with offices in the building. 
Irakisches Hilfswerk claims that the raid resulted in 
considerable damage and the "disappearance of $7,000 from the 
premises."  The NGO apparently also conveyed its concern 
about the safety of its staff. 
 
¶2.  (U) Action requested:  Post is faxing a copy of the Aide 
Memoire to EUR/AGS.  We appreciate Washington guidance on a 
response.
