¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche May 16 to Alexandre 
Crozat, Head of the Office for Civil Aviation Security Measures at 
the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC).   Crozat stressed that 
France would wish to hear the ICAO discussions before coming to 
final decisions on these issues.  Nonetheless, he offered some 
preliminary thoughts on the topics we raised. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Flight crew compartment and POC network: He expressed some 
doubts about the use of the POC network and was not sure it was a 
priority to require infrastructure cabin changes to set up a 
secondary barrier.  However, France remained very motivated to 
reaffirm the necessity of correctly protecting the cockpit, 
primarily through personnel training.  On enhancing the POC network, 
Crozat was in favor of enlargement to include as many states as 
possible, and agreed that testing should be done, though he thought 
that issues for discussion with emergency contacts rather than 
regular authorities would need to be chosen with care. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Emerging Threats Working Group, AVSEC Panel, Audit 
Transparency: France is interested in the idea of enhancing the 
discussion of security related issues within ICAO, and thinks the 
change from Aviation Security Panel to Commission could also be 
looked at. On Emerging Threats he was not sure that it would be easy 
to get colleagues to share intelligence information in the ICAO 
environment - it was already very difficult within the G8. On the 
change from Panel to Commission, Crozat was worried that too 
frequent meetings would be a downside. He said that both actions 
should be closely coordinated, to avoid duplication of efforts.  On 
the transparency of audit information, he stated "We are getting 
more and more comfortable with the idea of transparency."  France is 
prepared to think about sharing mechanisms that ensure an adequate 
protection of data, where useful information to mitigate the risk 
from incoming flights can be gathered.
