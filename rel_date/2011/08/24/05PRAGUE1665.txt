¶1. Pol Specialist Nov 28 confirmed with the Interior Ministry 
that the Czech Republic plans to extend the Czech 
participation in police training in Jordan. The Ministry of 
Interior has already allocated the necessary financing. The 
proposal to extend is now being reviewed in the Czech 
interagency process. In December the Interior Ministry will 
forward the extension proposal to the Czech Government, and 
the measure will automatically be approved if no objection is 
raised. The Interior Ministry predicts the measure will pass 
without comment.
