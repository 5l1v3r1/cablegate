REF: ANKARA 1427 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) In the first half of June 2007, 17 security personnel died in 
PKK-related violence.  During the same period 37 security officials 
were wounded in action (WIA).  This reflects a significant increase 
so far in June: In the entire month of May, 15 security forces were 
KIA, 52 wQded.  A civilian was injured when he stepped on a land 
mine. 
 
¶3. (U) In the first half of June the body of a PKK terrorist was 
found in the field during counterinsurgency operations and 22 PKK 
terrorists were arrested, including six who surrendered.  On two 
occasions, June 11 and 14, the PKK intimidated groups of civilians. 
One incident involved forest workers in Bitlis and the second group 
was marble workers in Diyarbakir.  On both occasions the PKK robbed 
the workers but did not hurt them. 
 
¶4. (U) The PKK denied responsibility for a June 15 bomb blast that 
wounded seven people in Turkey's largest Kurdish city, Diyarbakir. 
The bomb, hidden in a bicycle seat, exploded near a bus stop often 
used by military personnel; one of those injured was a soldier. "The 
way the incident happened and the type of explosive used indicates 
who did it," Interior Minister Osman Gunes said, in an apparent 
reference to the PKK.  He said a detailed statement would be made 
after the police completed their investigation. 
 
¶5. (U) The TGS website reported 20 clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in the region.  Security forces unearthed dozens 
of PKK shelters and caves and seized booby-trapped land mines; other 
explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; 
hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite 
antennas; and radios.
