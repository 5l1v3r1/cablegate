¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Delegations in Vienna are starting to discuss 
more openly their position on a potential one year extension of 
Executive Director Costa's term, as well as the possibility of other 
candidates.  In the past week Charge has been approached by Canada, 
Sweden, Australia and France, all inquiring into the U.S. position 
on Costa's desire for an extension.  Canada expressed opposition to 
any extension, while Sweden, Australia and France all stated that 
they have not yet received instructions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU In a recent conversation Charge asked Swedish Ambassador 
Hans Lundborg if Stockholm would field a candidate to succeed Costa, 
as we had heard from others.  Lundborg stated that Sweden has yet to 
make a decision on a possible Costa extension, but that in any event 
it was unlikely Sweden would advance a candidate given its dim view 
of UNODC these days.  Although Sweden intends to increase its level 
of general purpose contribution to the UNODC for 2009, Lundborg 
stated that if things continue to proceed at the UNODC as they are 
under Costa, "I guarantee Swedish support will go to zero." 
Lundborg gave no indication that he was personally interested in the 
position.  (Reftel) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In a separate conversation with Charge, the French Charge 
noted attraction to the Geneva group position on term limits, but 
also expressed appreciation for Costa's leadership.  The now 
departed French Ambassador had earlier informed us that major donors 
to the UNODC would be "crazy" not to support a Costa extension. 
Responding to the French Charge's query regarding U.S. views, Charge 
seconded France's appreciation for Costa's work, and noted that 
USG's position has nothing to do with Costa himself, but everything 
to do with adhering to a consistent policy on term limits across UN 
leadership. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Given the ongoing uncertainty of Costa's future, and the 
possibility that multiple candidates could emerge, Mission expects 
the intrigue and politicking to intensify in the next few months but 
is likely that this speculation has gotten back to Costa.  As Canada 
noted in explaining their own resistance to an extension, it is 
entirely possible that Costa will be able to wire this on his own 
through SYG Ban, presenting us with a fait accompli.
