(U) On March 17, Poloff contacted Claudette Francis in the 
Caribbean and Americas Department at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Foreign Trade (MFAFT) to ascertain the 
appropriate recipients for ref A talking points.  Francis 
informed Poloff that GOJ would not/not be sending a special 
delegation to the OAS Ministerial in Bogota.  Instead, 
Francis indicated that it was most likely that the CDA at the 
Jamaican Embassy in Bogota, Elaine Sanchez, would represent 
GOJ.  Therefore, also on March 17, Poloff contacted the 
political section at AmEmbassy Bogota and asked that the 
talking points be delivered to Sanchez as soon as possible. 
Per ref B, poloff at AmEmbassy Bogota indicated that the 
points are scheduled to be delivered on Tuesday, March 21 at 
the Jamaican mission in Bogota.
