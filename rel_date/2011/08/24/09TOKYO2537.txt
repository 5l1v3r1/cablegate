¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Embassy AID Counselor delivered points and 
discussed contents of reftel with Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Director of Assistance Planning for Afghanistan-Pakistan 
Hikariko Ono and Division Deputy Director Katsunori Ashida. 
As host of the April Tokyo Conference, Ono made clear that 
Japan shares our priority interest in expediting 
international donor community commitments made at the 
conference.  Ono was pleased to learn of USG progress in 
terms of obligating $400 million of the U.S. $1 billion 
pledge, and is very interested in the recent authorization of 
significantly increased U.S. aid for Pakistan.  Despite the 
fact that Japan's April $1 billion pledge has been slow to 
disburse, the GOJ is in the midst of formulating a 
substantial package of additional assistance for 
Afghanistan-Pakistan.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ono reported that as of October 26, Japan has 
obligated approximately $123 million of its $1 billion April 
Pakistan pledge, including both project loans and grant aid 
for a range of UNDP and UNICEF activities including polio 
eradication and peace-building efforts, as well as funding 
for improvements of roads and water supply systems in 
selected sites. Post has forwarded via email the Foreign 
Ministry's summary chart of Japan's grant/loan aid 
allocations as directed in reftel.  Nearly one-third of 
Japan's pledge has been set aside for a $300 million World 
Bank program, which remains delayed given that the IBRD has 
not yet conducted a planning mission to Pakistan.  The GOJ is 
also planning to allocate portions of its remaining $1 
billion pledge for specific development projects including 
soft loans for power distribution/electricity sector 
projects, but admitted that it continues to be difficult to 
get concrete proposal from the Government of Pakistan (GOP). 
Ono projected that the major portions of its Pakistan aid 
pledge would not be fully on-line until Spring 2010. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Citing Japan's experience and general disappointment 
thus far in terms of getting concrete proposals/direction and 
timely approval from the GOP for projects, Ono openly 
wondered about the ability of the country to absorb the 
planned huge amount of additional assistance.   Ono and AID 
Counselor agreed that the collaboration between GOP and key 
donor countries and agencies in putting together a Malakand 
region development strategy could be a promising framework 
for closer future integrated aid and faster moving efforts. 
Notwithstanding its experience to date, the GOJ is clearly 
committed to putting together an even more substantial 
package of civilian assistance for both Afghanistan and 
Pakistan, in advance of President Obama's upcoming visit to 
Tokyo.  Comment:  The GOJ's Pakistan assistance programs are 
relatively nascent in comparison to its Afghanistan efforts 
which have been ongoing since 2002.  With this in mind both 
MOFA and JICA officials continue to express interest in the 
possibility of building on, and/or complementing USAID and 
other USG programs in Pakistan.  As the additional USG 
assistance authorized by Congress comes on line and the new 
GOJ package takes shape, comprehensive assistance 
consultations between the U.S. and Japan on our respective 
Pakistan efforts may be particularly useful. End Comment.
