SUBJECT: NOMINATION FOR APRIL 2-13 TRAINING COURSE 
 
REF: STATE 4727 
 
Adana wishes to nominate Hamza Ulucay to participate in the FSN 
political training course.  Mr. Ulucay's skills in political 
analysis, drafting and translating are superb; he would become 
even more valuable to us if he had the knowledge of and 
experience with the organization of the Department and the 
inter-agency process.  In addition, Adana's contributions to the 
annual Human Rights Report and Religious Freedom Report are 
critical and Mr. Ulucay would benefit from interaction with DRL 
personnel responsible for those reports. 
 
Mr. Ulucay is a natural leader of the FSNs in Adana and he will 
share his experiences with younger members of our staff, 
including Adana's PD and Economic FSNs, both of whom have been 
hired in the past two years.  Mr. Ulucay is expected to continue 
working at post, and will use the training, for five to ten more 
years.  Furthermore, I am certain that during the training FSNs 
from other posts could benefit from Mr. Ulucay's extensive 
experience. 
 
Mr. Ulucay has had a few brief visits to the U.S., including a 
trip to be honored as FSN of the Year, but has not received any 
formal training there.  To our knowledge, Adana has never sent 
an FSN to participate in political training at FSI.

and interviewing victims about their experiences. Before the
