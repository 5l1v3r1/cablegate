Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche on November 13 to 
MFA desk officer for International Organizations Fanny 
Benedetti.  Benedetti said that discussions within the French 
government concerning the resolution were ongoing in Paris 
and New York.  As a co-sponsor of the current draft, France 
intends to vote in favor of the resolution.  However, 
Benedetti noted that France could well abstain if amendments 
watered down the objectives.  She acknowledged the text had 
evolved considerably from the original, suggesting that 
France was beginning to suffer from amendment fatigue.
