Chairman's Statement 
 
Meeting of the NATO-Georgia Commission at the level of 
Foreign Ministers held at NATO Headquarters, Brussels, on 3 
December 2009 
 
The NATO-Georgia Commission (NGC) at the level of Foreign 
Ministers met in Brussels today to discuss the process of 
reforms within Georgia's Annual National Programme and the 
course for Georgia's Euro-Atlantic integration process.  NGC 
Ministers reaffirmed the central role of the NATO-Georgia 
Commission and the Annual National Programme in carrying out 
the Bucharest and Strasbourg/Kehl decisions.  They expressed 
their commitment to continue strengthening dialogue and 
practical cooperation at all levels of the NATO-Georgia 
relationship. 
 
NATO Ministers welcomed the progress Georgia showed in a 
number of areas in implementing its Annual National Programme 
(ANP) goals, welcomed the smooth transition from the 
Individual Partnership Action Plan to the ANP, and commended 
Georgia for the effective intra-governmental process 
coordinating reforms.  NATO Ministers welcomed the initiation 
of dialogue regarding electoral and constitutional reforms in 
Georgia.  At the same time, they noted that much work remains 
to be done to implement reforms, and that the Georgian 
Government, as well as opposition forces, must demonstrate 
political will in implementing democratic reforms.  NATO 
Ministers noted that they attach great importance to the 
conduct of free and fair local elections in Georgia in spring 
¶2010.  They encouraged Georgia to deepen reforms regarding 
media freedom and the rule of law.  They welcomed Georgia's 
decision to conduct a broad review of its security sector, 
but noted the need for more effective defence planning and 
financial and human resource management.  NGC Ministers 
welcomed the successful start of the Professional Development 
Programme for Civilian Personnel of the Georgian Ministry of 
Defence and Other Security Institutions, managed by NATO. 
NGC Ministers also welcomed the work that has been done thus 
far to establish a NATO Liaison Office in Georgia, but noted 
that further work in this regard is required. 
 
NATO Ministers expressed strong appreciation for Georgia's 
decision to make a substantial contribution to ISAF, to 
include an infantry company and an infantry battalion without 
national caveats.  NATO Ministers welcomed these 
contributions as a demonstration of Georgia's commitment to 
our shared security. 
 
NGC Ministers expressed their strong support for the 
international process of negotiations in Geneva, and 
expressed their regret over the Russian veto of the UN and 
OSCE missions in Georgia.  NGC Ministers urged Russia to 
fulfil all of its commitments with regard to Georgia under 
the EU-mediated cease-fire agreement, and urged Russia not to 
undertake any steps that undermine the security of Georgia. 
They expressed their strong support for the work of the 
European Union Monitoring Mission (EUMM), and stressed the 
need for international monitors to have unimpeded access to 
the entire territory of Georgia, including throughout the 
South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions of the country.  NATO 
Ministers reaffirmed their strong support for Georgia's 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity as 
recognised by international law and United Nations Security 
Council resolutions.  They noted Georgia's full compliance 
with the EU-mediated cease-fire agreement, welcomed Georgia's 
good cooperation with the EUMM, and expressed concern about 
the detention of Georgian civilians near the administrative 
boundary lines, including minors.  NATO Ministers reaffirmed 
 
USNATO 00000564  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
their strict policy of non-recognition of the "independence" 
of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions of Georgia, and 
called once again on Russia to reverse its decision in this 
regard. 
 
Foreign Minister Vashadze outlined the Georgian Government's 
efforts to deepen reforms under the Annual National 
Programme.  He reaffirmed Georgia's commitment to peaceful 
resolution of conflicts, full implementation of obligations 
under the EU-mediated cease-fire agreement, full cooperation 
with the European Union Monitoring Mission, and constructive 
participation in the Geneva Talks.  Minister Vashadze also 
drew attention to human rights violations on the occupied 
territories and adjacent villages and continuing security 
incidents that undermine the fragile security situation in 
the region.

¶2. (U) COMMENT: Because a Chairman's statement is issued 
under the Secretary General's own authority as the Chair of 
the NGC, it is not a binding policy document in the same way 
that an agreed Joint Statement would be.  END COMMENT
