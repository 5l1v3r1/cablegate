REF: JERUSALEM 258 
 
¶1.  (SBU) UNRWA contacts told Poloff that UNRWA resumed aid 
shipments to Gaza.  Forty-eight truckloads of food and 
non-food items were transferred by UNRWA through Kerem Shalom 
on February 11. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The resumption of aid shipments follows the return 
on February 8 and 9 of 3,500 blankets and 400 food parcels 
taken from Beach refugee camp February 3, and 300 metric tons 
of rice and flour taken on February 5.  UNRWA contacts told 
Poloff February 9 that UNRWA decided to resume shipments 
after "every sack and every blanket" had been returned and 
UNRWA had "received assurances and seen actions" that 
convinced them the problem would not reoccur.
