REF: 04/29/08 DOE Sperl-Young e-mail on meeting with SAG 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Bilateral cooperation on energy modeling as a key 
aspect of planning for electricity supply and demand is proceeding. 
Meanwhile, Post raised energy cooperation, both in energy modeling 
and in nuclear energy, at the Embassy's Annual Bilateral Forum 
discussions on May 29, 2008.  The proposed bilateral Agreement on 
Cooperation on Nuclear Energy R&D is under review by DOE.  The SAG 
has the responsibility for taking next step on proposing a date for 
hosting and launching the long-sought Joint Standing Committee on 
Nuclear Energy Cooperation (JSCNEC) as a framework for nuclear 
cooperation.  End Summary.

¶2.  (SBU) Department of Minerals and Energy Deputy Director-General: 
Hydrocarbons, Energy Planning and Clean Energy Nhlanhla Gumede gave 
Minerals/Energy Officer and Specialist a read-out on his recent 
discussions in Washington on June 3, 2008 (Ref).  Gumede was 
optimistic about working with the DOE Energy Information Agency 
(EIA) - and perhaps USTDA - to set up a SAG energy modeling agency 
and tool.  He said the next step would be for the SAG Central Energy 
Fund (CEF) to put out a tender - perhaps with USTDA assistance - to 
find a service provider to build a modeling tool appropriate for 
South Africa.  Gumede hoped that there would be a mechanism so that 
ex-EIA individuals might be engaged to work on the project.  Gumede 
leads a task team working to advance the energy modeling project. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Gumede was cautiously optimistic for securing the enabling 
legal framework for setting up and empowering the new energy 
modeling agency, admitting that the current "political transition" 
within the ANC created uncertainty that could delay the optimistic 
calendar for passage of the National Energy Bill in Parliament.  He 
said the Bill was discussed in the National Energy Summit May 16, 
noting that modeling was a key aspect of planning necessary to sort 
out the current electricity crisis.  Gumede feared that if the Bill 
was not passed by August, then it may not be achievable until well 
after the national elections in 2009.  He also said the new National 
Energy Bill did not address imminent problems and under-investment 
in electricity distribution, noting that KwaZulu Natal was currently 
quite "wobbly" with respect to distribution.

Bilateral Discussions on Energy 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In the Embassy's Bilateral Annual Forum discussions on May 
29, Energy Officer identified cooperation in energy with respect to 
energy modeling and nuclear energy.  Energy Officer stated that the 
USG was eager for the SAG to reschedule the oft-postponed launch of 
the Joint Standing Committee on Nuclear Energy Cooperation as a 
framework for discussing nuclear cooperation.  Energy Officer also 
cited USG interest in pursuing the Megaports proposal for increasing 
capacity for detecting radioactive materials at the Port of Durban 
Qcapacity for detecting radioactive materials at the Port of Durban 
(The SA Revenue Service is still leading the SAG inter-agency 
process on this initiative).   SAG DME and DFA representatives did 
not provide a response to these requests for status.  DME asked for 
the status of language proposed by the SAG for the IP Annex of the 
Agreement on Cooperation in Nuclear R&D.  Energy Officer replied 
that the DOE legal staff was still reviewing the recently proposed 
language.  DME also mentioned the feasibility study for the return 
of U.S.-origin spent nuclear fuel from Pelindaba.  DME said this 
study would be presented to the Minister, but did not indicate when 
this would happen. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT: Post will continue to push for the launch of the 
Joint Standing Committee on Nuclear Energy Cooperation as a useful 
vehicle for nuclear cooperation.  Signing the Agreement on 
Cooperation in Nuclear Energy R&D would be a constructive first 
step.  Post will continue to advocate for the Westinghouse bid for 
new nuclear build.  The potential Westinghouse contract would 
complement USG efforts to increase bilateral nuclear cooperation.
