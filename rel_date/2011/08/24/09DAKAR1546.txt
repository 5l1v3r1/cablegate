SUBJECT: SENEGAL: Homosexuals Arrested and Released 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On Christmas Eve police in Mbour (a town 70 km south of 
Dakar) raided a private residence in the resort town of Saly and 
arrested 24 men who had gathered there to celebrate.  Among the 24 
arrestees were two French doctors.  According to news reports, the 
party was "infiltrated" by agents of the police.  Once enough 
"evidence" was gathered, police were called in.  All 24 men admitted 
to being homosexuals and police reportedly found certain items in 
the house to confirm this, precipitating the arrest. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) However, the next day, all 24 men were released without 
any charges being pressed.  According to further reporting, the 
police were at a loss to explain why the men were let go despite the 
fact that there was more than enough "evidence" to hold them.  One 
police officer anonymously commented that this was a political 
decision and that, when the release order came, no reason was given. 
 A spokesperson for the human rights organization ONDH said that 
Senegal had recently faced a lot of international pressure over the 
issue of homosexuality and that the presence of two Frenchmen in the 
group probably led to their release in order to stave off the 
inevitable criticism that the government would have had to deal with 
had the men been formally charged. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) What is worrisome is not just the blatant targeting of a 
specific group of people, but the amount of effort police in Mbour 
allegedly put into this operation.  As a popular resort town, Saly 
is well known as a place where anything is available for a price. 
There are credible reports of child trafficking for the purpose of 
prostitution with tourists coming from Europe.  Instead of tackling 
this heinous form trafficking in persons, the police chose to focus 
on the issue of homosexuality, which is not even explicitly illegal 
under Senegalese law.
