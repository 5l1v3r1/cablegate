in Turkey's May 2006 exercise.  Finally, EXBS Advisor was 
informed that revised NP Agreement has been forwarded to 
Turkish Parliament for ratification. End Summary. 
 
¶2.      Completed Actions for the Reporting Period 
 
¶A.        Site Assessment and Meetings During Recent 
Reporting Period 
 
1)  February 3- EXBS Advisor held monthly update meeting with 
MFA First Secretary for Arms Control and Disarmament Guven 
Begec to discuss current projects in Turkey, including 
Internal Control Program (ICP), Commodity Identification 
Training (CIT), Product Identification Tool (PIT) and Second 
Line of Defense (SLD). EXBS Advisor confirmed the Feb 13 
visit by ICP and PIT project coordinator, Commonwealth 
Trading Partners (CTP) representative.  Meetings are 
scheduled with Customs and UFT personnel. This one day visit 
will include information sharing and a meeting with the 
contractor being considered to work on the customization of 
both projects.  Begec welcomed the visit as a way to move the 
projects forward. 
 
2)  February 6- EXBS Advisor participated in meetings held 
between Department of Homeland Security Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE) Attach, DHS CSI representatives 
and senior Turkish Customs officials concerning the Container 
Security Initiative (CSI) and the inclusion of the Port of 
Izmir in the program.  The meetings discussed program 
implementation, the need for an approved implementation 
agreement and equipment and information exchanges. 
 
Following the CSI discussions, EXBS Advisor met with 
Department Head for Export Controls, General Directorate of 
Customs Sevilay Turksen to review CIT and PIT projects. 
Turksen informed EXBS Advisor that she was still awaiting a 
decision from senior Turkish Customs officials on  the 
approved course of action for the customization of the PIT 
program.  The two options are: 1) to utilize only Turkish 
Customs resources, or 2) to utilize an outside contractor for 
the general work, with specific Customs information added 
later.  EXBS Advisor stressed that the project could be 
completed faster and with less strain on limited Turkish 
Customs resources by using the combination method.  EXBS 
Advisor also informed Turksen of the upcoming Feb 13 visit by 
the CTP representative to discuss the status of the project. 
 
3)  February 7- EXBS Advisor met with MFA First Secretary for 
Arms Control and Disarmament Guven Begec to arrange the 
schedule of the Feb 16-17 Iran Nuclear briefing team.  EXBS 
Advisor also confirmed the visit by ICP and PIT project 
coordinator. 
 
4)  February 13- EXBS Advisor accompanied CTP representative 
in a meeting with Department Head for Export Controls, 
General Directorate of Customs Sevilay Turksen to review PIT 
project.  Turksen stated that she was still waiting for a 
decision from senior Turkish Customs officials on the 
approved course of action for the customization of the PIT 
program.  The two options are: 1) to utilize only Turkish 
Customs resources, or 2) to utilize an outside contractor for 
the general work, with specific Customs information added 
later.  CTP rep re-enforced previously stated opinion that 
the project could probably be completed quicker and with less

strain on limited Turkish Customs resources by using the 
combination method. 
 
EXBS Advisor and CTP representative also met with Ministry of 
Foreign Trade (UFT) and Siemens Corp (lead potential 
contractor) reps concerning the ICP program status.  A 
detailed briefing on the project was provided by UFT and 
Siemens, and a timeline for completing the final statement of 
work was outlined, with the goal of a mid-March completion of 
the statement of work.  Once the final statement of work and 
budget proposal is completed and approved by CTP, 
customization of the computer program can begin. 
 
5)  February 15 - 17 - EXBS Advisor served as control officer 
and coordinated meetings for the visit of a multi-agency Iran 
nuclear briefing team led by US UNVIE Ambassador Schulte. 
These briefings provided evidence to support the 
international community's belief that the Iranian program is 
not just for peaceful uses.  A wide range of Turkish 
government officials participated in these briefings. Amb 
Schulte also briefed the media.  More details of these 
briefings were reported in ref b. 
 
6)          February 22- EXBS Advisor met with MFA Second 
Secretary for Arms Control and Disarmament Serhan Ali Yigit

participation in the May 24-26, 2006 Turkey-led PSI exercise. 
 EXBS Advisor also discussed the March 3 meetings with TAEK 
and TNP concerning the uranium seizure that occurred in 
August 2005.  Yigit noted that he hoped that this exchange of 
information would assist both countries and the international 
community in the fight against illegal sales of uranium and 
other WMD material.  Finally, Yigit informed EXBS Advisor 
that the revised NP Agreement was being prepared for 
submission to the Turkish Parliament for ratification.
