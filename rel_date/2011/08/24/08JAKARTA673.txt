¶1. (SBU) Please see Action Request in para 5. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Naval Medical Research Unit in Jakarta 
(NAMRU-2) has just received a letter from the Indonesian 
Ministry of Health (MOH) informing NAMRU that "all 
studies/surveillance which include transfer of biological 
specimens" must cease pending conclusion of the Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) currently being negotiated between NAMRU 
and the government of Indonesia.  The letter, dated March 31, 
is signed by Triono Soendoro, Director of the National 
Institute of Health Research and Development within the MOH. 
The text of the letter, which is in English, appears in para 
6 below.  Mission previously sent the letter by email to 
Washington agencies and the U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) IMPACT:  If implemented, this directive would 
further limit NAMRU-2's ability to operate.  NAMRU-MOH 
cooperation is already restricted regarding avian influenza 
due to the GOI,s position on sample sharing.  The letter 
would broaden that restriction to all biological specimens. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) CONTEXT:  The letter comes after several months of 
increasingly bizarre allegations by Indonesian Minister of 
Health Supari about supposed U.S. intentions to misuse 
Indonesian samples of avian influenza.  According to reliable 
official sources, the GOI is becoming tired of Supari's 
allegations and the public misperceptions generated by her 
remarks.  This might be an opportune time to push for 
conclusion of the MOU, which has been in negotiation now for 
nearly two years.  Resumption of the negotiations could be a 
constructive way to widen the gap between Supari, a NAMRU 
opponent, and President Yudhoyono, whose office has strongly 
supported NAMRU.  Conclusion of an MOU now would give 
Supari's opponents a boost. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) RECOMMENDED ACTION:  Mission repeats reftel request 
for Washington action to conclude the inter-agency review of 
the current Indonesia-proposed MOU text so that Mission can 
resume negotiations with the GOI.

T.R. Jones, Ph.D 
Director of NAMRU 2 
Jakarta 
 
Dear Dr. Jones: 
 
Subject:  Temporary Cessation of Studies 
 
As you may very well know, the collaboration between the 
Government of Indonesia -- through the national Institute of 
Health Research and Development -- with the government of the 
United States of America -- through NAMRU-2, Jakarta -- in 
research of infectious diseases was started since 1970.  This 
collaboration has been conducted in the spirit of mutually 
beneficial, in order to enhance friendship and bilateral 
cooperation between the two countries. 
 
We are aware that in consideration of the positive outcomes, 
both parties have agreed to continue this collaboration.  The 
new MOU, that is still being negotiated, contains -- among 
others -- issues of studies/ surveillance which include 
transfer of biological specimens. 
 
According to the laws and regulations in Indonesia, each and 
every transfer of biological specimens to foreign 
institutions/countries must have a MTA (Material Transfer 
Agreement) document.  Therefore, since negotiation of the MOU 
has not reached final decision yet, all studies/surveillance 
conducted by NAMRU-2 -- both current and new proposals -- 
which involve specimens from various institutions in 
 
JAKARTA 00000673  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Indonesia (Universities/Hospital/Health Centers, etc) have to 
be ceased temporarily until the new MOU is signed. 
 
Please be informed that we are asking all institutions in 
Indonesia to terminate all collaboration which involves 
transferring of biological specimens to NAMRU-2, unless a MTA 
is signed for that purpose. 
 
Thank you. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Triono Soendoro
