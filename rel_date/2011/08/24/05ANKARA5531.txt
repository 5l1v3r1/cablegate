SUPPORTS DRAFT CONVENTION 
 
REF: STATE 170909 
 
(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Hande Ceylan, MFA 
Multilateral Cultural Affairs Department on September 22. 
Poloff explained US concerns regarding the draft Convention's 
possible infringement of human rights and freedom of 
expression.  Ceylan noted Turkey would support the draft 
Convention as written with the following reservation: Article 
20, Part One, Part B of the draft Convention is incompatible 
with Turkey's domestic legal procedures.  Ceylan explained 
that the clause in that article would create difficulties for 
Turkey and therefore the minor reservation was necessary. 
Ceylan stated that the above position was not only that of 
the MFA, but also the position of all relevant Turkish 
authorities.
