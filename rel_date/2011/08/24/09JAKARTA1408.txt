in paragraph 7. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Indonesian government has 
proposed a health cooperation memorandum of 
understanding to be released during the President's 
proposed trip to Indonesia.  This document would be 
one in a series that would lead to the establishment 
of a joint center for health research, to succeed the 
Naval Medical Research Unit, and an overall 
strengthening of our health cooperation as part of 
the U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership. 
Mission believes that the MOU could be a positive 
step in deepening our health cooperation.  However, 
the GOI draft requires substantial revision in order 
to reflect the full spectrum of our health-related 
activities and to remove passages that raise 
potential legal or policy problems.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BROADER FRAMEWORK FOR HEALTH COOPERATION 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ministry of Health (MOH) officials have put 
forward a revised Health Cooperation Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) during our ongoing discussions of 
transforming the U.S. Navy Medical Research Unit 
(NAMRU) into the joint Indonesia-United States Center 
for Biomedical and Public Health Research (IUC).  The 
text of the MOU, which MOH officials provided on 
August 24, is in paragraph 8.  This text replaces a 
previous draft that the MOH submitted but 
subsequently withdrew (see Ref A). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Indonesian officials have underscored their 
interest in deepening health cooperation with the 
United States as part of our developing Comprehensive 
Partnership.  They noted the MOU on U.S.-Russia 
health cooperation released during the President's 
recent visit to Moscow and proposed that we develop 
something similar.  This text is the GOI's effort 
toward that goal. 
 
WHERE THIS FITS 
 
¶5.  (SBU) This document would be one of four that the 
MOH envisions leading to the establishment of the IUC 
and the full normalization of our health cooperation. 
These are: 
 
--A) Joint Statement on expanded health cooperation 
to be released when Minister Supari meets HHS 
Secretary Sebelius in Washington in September; 
 
--B) Announcement of the establishment of the IUC to 
be released in Jakarta in early October; 
 
--C) MOU on Health Cooperation to be released during 
the President's proposed November visit to Indonesia 
(the draft in paragraph 8); and, 
 
--D) Agreement covering operation of the IUC, 
including the status of personnel, governance 
mechanisms, and related matters to be completed by 
the end of 2009. 
 
Of these, Mission envisions that only item D would be 
a legally binding agreement.  The others would be 
non-binding political declarations.  We have already 
engaged the MOH on item A, using the HHS-drafted text 
previously submitted, and are close to agreement (see 
Ref B). 
 
OUR VIEW 
 
 
JAKARTA 00001408  002 OF 005 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mission believes that the GOI draft MOU 
represents a good start but will require substantial 
revision.  We recommend that the text be redrafted to 
reflect the full spectrum of U.S-Indonesia health 
cooperation, including the efforts of all USG 
agencies engaged in this sector.  For example, such 
text could encompass the USG PEPFAR Partnership 
Framework for Indonesia which is to be negotiated in 
FY10. The text should exclude any language that 
raises potential policy or legal complications, such 
as the sections on intellectual property rights or a 
material transfer agreement. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
 
¶7.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Ministry of Health 
officials have told us that they hope to discuss the 
draft MOU with USG counterparts during Minister 
Supari's planned September 14-15 visit to Washington. 
Mission requests that Washington agencies be prepared 
to offer a substantive USG response to the draft MOU, 
ideally before but no later than, during that visit. 
END ACTION REQUEST 
 
¶8.  (U) MOH supplied text of the MOU follows.  Note: 
The MOH has struck text from their original draft in 
the revised version they provided to us.  This text 
is indicated in brackets below.
