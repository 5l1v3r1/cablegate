REF: STATE 100304 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Rwanda Defense Force (RDF) J4 General Patrick 
Nyamvumba discussed readiness, timetables and deployment 
obstacles with pol/econ chief September 23.  Nyamvumba 
described the early September Integrated Team Visit (ITV) by 
UN officials as a success, the two sides agreeing that Rwanda 
was generally ready to deploy and could begin to do so 
starting October 25, and continuing until early December.  A 
UN Pre-Deployment Visit (PDV) team will arrive Sunday, 
September 28 for a final three-day assessment; more than one 
PDV may be conducted by UN personnel. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) While some equipment for the four battalions to be 
deployed to Darfur has yet to arrive (chiefly 58 Chinese APCs 
and some medical gear from the Netherlands), Rwanda has 
argued and believes the ITV team agreed that full possession 
of all military equipment is not necessary to begin 
deployment.  Some engineering issues remain to be decided 
regarding expansion of camps for the four battalions in 
Darfur, but these can be resolved, said Nyamvumba.  Nyamvumba 
said the ITV team also appeared to accept Rwanda's position 
that all four battalions to be deployed will be 800-man 
contingents, rather than sized to match those now in Darfur. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The major concern for the RDF remains the shipment 
of accompanying peace-keeping equipment to Darfur.  Rwanda 
has argued that both men and gear should be airlifted from 
Rwanda to Darfur, as the most efficient and trustworthy 
route.  Transport by road and sea to Dar-es-Salaam and then 
to Port Sudan, or by road through Uganda to southern Sudan, 
runs too great a risk of either delaying tactics by the 
Sudanese government, or loss of equipment through use along 
lengthy routes in rough conditions.
