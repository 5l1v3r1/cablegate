Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Arab Countries Department 
No. 2/202/12/9 
January 1, 2008 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs presents its best compliments 
to the Embassy of the United States of America in Sana'a and 
would like to express its concern over the news of the 
Israeli government's intention to build a new settlement in 
Abu Ghunaim Mountain between the towns of Jerusalem and Bait 
Lahem in the West Bank. 
 
In view of the fact that these settlements represent a clear 
breach of the road map and a challenge to the international 
and Arab demand to stop all settlement activities; such steps 
are threatening to any peaceful process that could be 
initiated between Palestinian and Israeli sides.  We think 
that such settlement projects serve only radical forces and 
threaten to blow up all efforts to revive the comprehensive 
peace process in the region. 
 
We would like to reiterate the expression of our deep concern 
and hope that pressure be exerted on Israel to stop such 
activities that will undermine the peace process immediately. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs avails itself of the 
opportunity to renew to the esteemed Embassy the assurances 
of its highest consideration. 
 
To The Embassy of the United States of America in Sana'a. 
Protocol, January 7, 2008
