SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S RAISES 7TH ROTATION TO IRAQ WITH 
PRESIDENT, SPEAKER, PM 
 
 
Sensitive but unclassified -- not for Internet distribution. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On September 5, Ambassador paid a farewell call on 
Prime Minister Enkhbold, and on September 6 she met with 
President Enkhbayar and Speaker Nyamdorj.  In all the calls, 
the Ambassador lauded close military-military relations, and 
noted U.S. support for Mongolia's efforts to have its 
military play a larger peacekeeping role.  She praised 
Mongolia's recent hosting, with U.S. support, of its 
first-ever multinational peacekeeping training exercise, 
Khaan Quest, and commented that the exercise had "put 
Mongolia on the map" with its Asian neighbors and highlighted 
Mongolia's peacekeeping role.  She urged Mongolia to remain 
committed to Coalition operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, 
and asked that Mongolia's National Security Council (NSC, 
comprised of the President, Speaker and Prime Minister) agree 
to send a 7th rotation at roughly the 100-troop level of the 
current rotation.  She noted that this was not just a U.S. 
desire, that Mongolia had been requested by the Government of 
Iraq to send the rotation to assist its democratic 
transition.  In addition, the Polish Government, which has a 
primary interest in Mongolia's continuing commitment, has 
formally requested a full troop rotation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In their own points lauding the current good state 
of Mongolia-U.S. relations, PM Enkhbold and Speaker Nyamdorj 
listened closely to the Ambassador's presentation, but 
neither touched either on military cooperation or on Iraq. 
During the September 6 call on the President, Enkhbayar 
praised close bilateral military relations and the Khaan 
Quest exercise.  He said he had discussed the 7th rotation 
with the Prime Minister and some other members of the Cabinet 
to learn why they had made a preliminary decision to 
substantially reduce the number of soldiers in the 7th 
rotation.  The NSC would use a different mechanism to 
consider the issue, he said, and would take into account the 
U.S. position, and that of Poland and Iraq.  The NSC would 
meet to discuss the matter soon.  He agreed that Mongolian 
soldiers who have served in Iraq are proud of doing so, and 
felt that it provided good training.  The Ambassador noted 
that Mongolia's request for HMMVs and other equipment for a 
full 7th rotation is being worked on through appropriate 
channels, and assured Enkhbayar that, per Admiral Fallon's 
statement last month, the U.S. intends to meet the request. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  The President departs in the next few 
days for the NAM summit in Havana, and the PM will be in the 
U.S. for the UNGA September 17-23.  With the 6th rotation 
term expiring at the end of September, that suggests the NSC 
should meet and decide on the 7th rotation before the 
President's departure for Havana.  Meanwhile, as DATT has 
reported, on August 24 the Mongolian Armed Forces began to 
train 120 soldiers in order to be prepared should the NSC 
decide on a 7th rotation of 100 soldiers.
