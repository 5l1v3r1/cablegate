END-USE CHECK ON LICENSE 05-956960 
 
REF: STATE 142256 
 
¶1. (SBU) Acting on instructions in reftel, Embassy Blue 
Lantern officer and Senior Commercial specialist met with 
Spectronix Vice President for Marketing Amos Gonen to (a) ask 
him if his company has any connection to Spectronics in 
Dallas, Texas; and (b) to confirm the details in the 
transaction covered by export license 05-956960. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Gonen said there is no connection between his 
company and the Spectronics company in Dallas, Texas (the 
company that is the subject of a law enforcement 
investigation for alleged diversion of sensitive defense 
articles), and appeared to have never heard of the company in 
Texas.  Gonen said Spectronix, Ltd. was established in 1967 
and is a public company.  Spectronix, Ltd. is a supplier to 
BAE Systems.  It is now the chosen supplier of the fire 
detection and suppression system for the Mine-Resistant 
Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicles being used by the U.S. 
military in Iraq. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Regarding the transaction covered by export license 
05-956960, Gonen confirmed (a) that his company had ordered 
75 244-28585 cables from Meggitt Safety Systems, Inc. in Simi 
Valley, California; (b) that his company received the cables 
back in 2005; (c) that they were integrated into control 
units made by his company in Sderot (Spectronix, Ltd.); and 
(d) that the control units were then shipped to General 
Dynamics Santa Barbara Systems in Sevilla, Spain for fitting 
into the Pizarro armored fighting vehicle.  Gonen explained 
that the cables in question are usually used in heat 
detection systems located within the engine compartments of 
aircraft or vehicles.  In the case of the cables in question, 
these were integrated into a fire detection system in the 
Pizarro, the Spanish version of the Bradley Armored Fighting 
Vehicle.  Gonen added that, as far as he understood, the 
cables in question are no longer considered controlled items 
by the USG.  He noted that the product the cables are used in 
is considered unclassified in Israel. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Gonen said that Spectronix, Ltd. has had a 
relationship with Meggitt Safety Systems, Inc. for many 
years.  His company employs about 120 people.  All of its 
facilities except one office are located in Sderot.  Gonen 
said that Blue Lantern Officer and Senior Commercial 
Specialist were welcome to visit the facilities at any time. 
He stressed that the majority of what Spectronix produces is 
for export, and that his relations with U.S. clients are 
critical.  It is, in his view, absolutely vital that he 
operates according to U.S. laws and regulations, as he does 
not wish to damage his company's standing in the U.S.  He 
feels confident that he knows and understands U.S. export 
control laws and regulations, and is complying with them. 
Gonen also appeared more familiar than most interlocutors of 
his type with the changes that are taking place in Israel's 
export control system.  Gonen pointed out that because he 
still has to obtain Israeli export licenses for Spectronix 
Ltd.'s exports, the Israeli MOD's Export Division (SIBAT) 
takes an interest in Spectronix Ltd.'s activities.  The MOD's 
Directorate for Security (MALMAB/DSDE) does not oversee 
Spectronix, Ltd.'s security, however, and has no 
representative at the company's facilities. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Gonen said Spectronix, Ltd. maintains records of all 
the parts it imports, uses, and exports, and expressed 
confidence he could provide the paperwork on a particular 
item if it were requested.  He turned over a copy of purchase 
order 62613 dated July 2, 2005 which confirmed the details of 
the transaction covered by export license 05-956960.  (NOTE: 
It has been sent by FAX to 202-261-8198.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶6. (SBU) Gonen said that Spectronix, Ltd. has been a supplier 
to General Dynamics Santa Barbara Systems (Spain's chief 
armored vehicle manufacturer) for many years, even since 
before its privatization by the Spanish Government, and its 
purchase by General Dynamics. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT:  Based on the information obtained during 
the interview with Amos Gonen, emboffs believe that 
Spectronix, Ltd. is a legitimate company and should be viewed 
favorably as a recipient of controlled items covered by 
export licenses issued by the Departments of State and 
Commerce.  The transaction covered by export license 
05-956960 appears to have been carried out according to U.S. 
law and regulations.  Spectronix, Ltd. does not appear to 
 
have any connection with Spectronics in Dallas, Texas. 
END COMMENT.
