Manufacturing Production Slows 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) According to Statistics South Africa (StatsSA), manufacturing 
output volumes declined from 5.2% y/y in August 2007 to 1.4% y/y in 
September 2007.  This decline was largely the result of lower 
production during September, which can be traced to strikes in the 
automotive component manufacturing industry, which had knock-on 
effects in the automobile sub-sector.  Apart from the automotive 
components industry, the food and beverages industry, the glass and 
non-metallic mineral products sector, and the iron and steel 
industry also dragged manufacturing output growth lower.  However, 
the negative contributions made by these industries were partially 
offset by increases recorded in the petroleum and chemical sector, 
the clothing and textiles sector, as well as the furniture 
manufacturing sector.  According to analysts, the contribution of 
the manufacturing sector to the  third quarter Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) is likely to slow down, or perhaps even turn negative, 
from the 0.5% annualized growth recorded during the second quarter 
of 2007.  (Fin 24, November 8, 2007)

Textile Tariff Plan A Boost For Factories 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The Department of Trade and Industry's (DTI) plan to cut 
tariffs on key inputs into strategic industrial sectors has got 
underway in earnest, with DTI's International Trade Administration 
Commission (ITAC) announcing the review of tariffs on textiles, 
aluminum and chemicals.  The textile tariff review is of particular 
importance as it could bring some relief to beleaguered clothing 
manufacturers who have been battling to survive an influx of cheap 
imports.  Clothing Trade Council of South Africa President Hassim 
Randeree said the removal of tariffs on textiles would be a 
significant step to help the clothing industry become 
internationally competitive.  The South African textile industry 
enjoys an effective protection rate of 22% on a wide range of 
textiles, primarily on textiles not manufactured in South Africa, 
putting a needless burden on clothing manufacturers who are taxed on 
fabrics they have no choice but to import.  Moreover, manufacturers 
complain that South African textile mills are inflexible and unable 
to do short runs on product lines or produce the variety required by 
the clothing industry.  However, the review could be challenged by 
other members of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) with 
interests in the sector, while labor union resistance may also be 
expected.  Textile Federation Executive Director Brian Brink 
cautioned that the review should be tackled "sensibly and not too 
Qcautioned that the review should be tackled "sensibly and not too 
narrowly," as it could have sweeping implications for related 
industries, such as farming, which provide some raw material inputs.

South Africans Forced To Live In Higher-Density Developments 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (U) The total number of newly-built South African houses of above 
80m2 as a share of the total houses built declined from 62.2% in 
2001 to 43.8% in 2007, whereas the share of newly-built flats and 
townhouses increased from 37.8% in 2001 to 56.2% in 2007.  Urban 
conditions such as traffic congestion and increased transport costs 
have forced many people to live in higher-density residential 
developments close to places of work and amenities such as shopping 
centers, schools and access routes.  Moreover, land scarcity, 
 
PRETORIA 00003973  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
especially in the major urban areas, the affordability of housing, 
and security concerns have also played an important role in the 
increasing popularity of higher-density housing.  Analysts expect 
the construction of more higher-density housing -- and even 
high-rise high-density housing -- to continue in the future in view 
of changing urban lifestyles, an increasing scarcity of development 
land, and the continuous upward trend in property prices.  (ABSA

Mboweni In Favor Of Another Rate Hike 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) South African Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni said 
inflation pressures in South Africa were on the upside, and that he 
would raise interest rates in December 2007 if he were the sole 
member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).  The MPC, which 
Mboweni chairs and which meets once every two months, has increased 
interest rates by a cumulative 350 basis points since June 2006. 
CPIX-inflation (consumer price inflation excluding mortgage interest 
rates) has stayed above the top end of the Reserve Bank's 3%-6% 
target band since April this year.  In response to tighter monetary 
policy, retail sales growth slowed from 6.6% y/y in August to 2.0% 
y/y in September.  (Business Day, November 14, 2007) 
 
------------------------------------ 
No Apology Needed For Budget Surplus 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (U) Finance Minister Trevor Manuel defended the budget surplus 
planned by the government over the next three years, saying there 
was "no shame" in having a surplus and the government would not 
apologize for it.  The budget surplus was a precaution against 
uncertain prospects for the international economy which could result 
in next year being a tough year, Manuel said, "There is no failure 
in running a surplus.  There is no shame in taking out the 
unevenness, the boom and bust, and we shall not apologize for this". 
 The National Treasury has estimated cyclical revenue to amount to 
R87.7 billion ($13.5 billion) over the next three years.  Of this 
amount, R44.5 billion ($6.8 billion) would be saved, almost R15 
billion ($2.3 billion) a year for three years, or 0.6% of gross 
domestic product.  In spite of the surplus, Manuel pointed out that 
the SAG was committed to alleviate the erosion of social grants by 
inflation.  Manuel also argued strongly against any change to the 
inflation targeting band "even if it looks bad."  Manuel said there 
must be a commitment to price stability and he voiced confidence 
that the CPIX-inflation would fall back within the band next year. 
Manuel has been criticized for running a budget surplus in a 
developing country with huge social problems.  (Business Day,

SA Banks Not For Sale 
--------------------- 
 
7 (U) South African Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni has told 
parliament that the recent $5.5 billion acquisition of 20% of 
Standard Bank by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China was a 
"good thing" that "will help cement the relationship between China 
and South Africa."  Mboweni stressed, however, that the deal does 
not mean that a "for sale" sign has been hung on South African 
Qnot mean that a "for sale" sign has been hung on South African 
banks, as the state should "maintain strategic interests" in the 
banking sector.  Mboweni told parliament, "South Africa has to 
maintain its own strategic banking interest.  Does it mean that 
other banks are for sale?  No."   Some banks and analysts were 
critical of Mboweni's position, accusing the central banker of 
flouting standards of fair competition.  They said that allowing 
foreign investment in some banks (such as Standard and ABSA) at the 
expense of other banks would result in unfair competition and 
disadvantage consumers.  (Business Day, November 15, 2007)

Stadium Workers Strike 
---------------------- 
 
8 (U) Hundreds of construction workers at  the Moses Mabhida Stadium 
in Durban, one of the stadiums under construction for the 2010 
Soccer World Cup tournament, are engaged in a strike to protest 
against poor pay conditions.  Workers are demanding a minimum wage 
 
PRETORIA 00003973  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
of R11 an hour, project bonuses of R1,500 a month, and safety 
improvements.  The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which 
represents construction workers, claimed that workers were paid only 
R6 an hour, which they regard as pitiful and unfair.  The 
construction company, Group Five, disputed the claims, saying that 
the starting rate is R11.98 an hour, though it is said that 
subcontractors might be paying less.  NUM spokesperson Lesiba 
Seshoka said a sympathy strike at the 10 other stadiums under 
construction would commence soon if the demands of the Durban 
workers are not met.  This has raised concerns about the completion 
of infrastructure for the World Cup.  Meanwhile, over 3,000 FIFA 
delegates are expected to visit Durban to inspect the sites at the 
end of November.  (Pretoria News, November 15, 2007)
