MEETING WILL BLAME U.S. AND UK FOR ZIMBABWE'S WOES 
 
 
  l.Under headline "U.S., Britain will predictably 
     dominate ZANU PF conference" the independent daily 
     "The Daily News" dedicated its November 23 
     editorial to declaring that the United States and 
     Britain could "come under fire because of their 
     talk of 'regime change' at the ZANU PF congress to 
     be held in Chinhoyi next month.  Excerpts. 
 
  2.". . .The outcome of the Chinhoyi conference is 
     almost predictable.  Britain and the United States 
     of America will dominate the deliberations.  The 
     United Kingdom and the U.S. will come under fire 
     because of their talk of 'regime change.'  There 
     are sufficient indicators of what the conference 
     focus will be. the stand-off with the Americans 
     over the shooting of Richard Gilman, a U.S. 
     national, and the assault of U.S. Embassy 
     officials by war veterans, as well as the 
     allegations of a secret document by British 
     intelligence, working with the opposition. . . ."
