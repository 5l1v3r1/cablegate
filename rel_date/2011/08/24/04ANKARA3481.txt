BRIEFING 
 
A/S Bloomfield in Ankara:  "Hurriyet" fronts an exclusive 
from the visit of A/S State Lincoln Bloomfield and Assistant 
Secretary of Defense Andy Hoehn to Ankara.  The lead story 
 
SIPDIS 
says the US has started the negotiation process on the 
Global Defense Posture which includes the use of Turkish air 
bases, part of a 100-year plan for the US military 
structure.  Bloomfield told "Hurriyet" that the current 
process is about consultation and reviewing restructuring 
ideas and is not about bringing up new demands.  The daily 
interpreted the visit as a sign for a global restructuring 
that will have an impact on how NATO works and called on the 
Turkish government to be alert to the emerging demands.  The 
story notes that the US wants flexibility, speed and 
mobility in its new military posture, yet such concepts do 
not comply with the NATO process.  Thus Turkey should be 
ready for some changes in Turkish-US military cooperation, 
the daily noted.  All papers carried the Bloomfield visit as 
part of the Global Defense Posture consultations. 
 
Encouraging Messages From EU to Turkey:  The mass appeal 
"Hurriyet" draws attention to EU Commissioner Verheugen's 
words that the EU Commission's report about Turkey would be 
based on objective criteria.  Verheugen describes Turkey's 
EU policies as a success story.  "Turkiye" reports that the 
EU gave a signal to Turkey for the accession date with 
Verheugen saying that the accession talks with Turkey will 
not be just a formality.  "Radikal" notes that there were 
increasing positive messages for the start of accession 
talks.  "Radikal" also notes that Verheugen had highlighted 
Turkey's shortcomings in three areas: freedom of expression, 
freedom of worship and detention conditions. 
 
Kurdish Leaders Urge PKK to Lay Down its Arms:  "Yeni Safak" 
reports that under the leadership of Kurdistan Democratic 
Party (KDP) leader Barzani, all the other Kurdish leaders in 
Northern Iraq had urged PKK/KONGRA-GEL to cease terror 
attacks.  The leader of  the Kurdistan Islam party said that 
the violence will not help Kurdish people to gain their 
rights but the war would only serve the interests of the arm 
dealers.  The Kurdish leaders agree that the steps 
undertaken by Turkey for the Kurds' cultural rights were 
very important.
