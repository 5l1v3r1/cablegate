SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: U.S. WEAPONS RELEASE TO IRAQ - 
AN/AVS-9 NVGS 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see para 10. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Country Team requests the immediate 
release of AN/AVS-9 Night Vision Goggles (NVGs) to the 
Government of Iraq.  The system will be used by the Iraqi Air 
Force, the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Command and Coalition 
Forces to train and equip a select number of Iraqi pilots for 
night operations.  This training will advance nighttime 
operational effectiveness while reducing collateral damage 
risk.  The pilots are in training with Coalition Forces right 
now, and the latter are projected to integrate this equipment 
into training beginning in October 2007.  The USG will fund 
this estimated $1.5M acquisition through an ISFF Funded 
Foreign Military Sales case.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Description of Technology for Release 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) AN/AVS-9 Night Vision Goggles and provide high 
quality binocular image clarity essential for safe nighttime 
operations. They allow the wearer to select and clearly 
identify the enemy and reduce the possibility of collateral 
damage. 
 
Rationale for Technology Release 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Iraqi Armed Forces are in urgent need of a 
viable aviation night vision capability that will allow them 
to safely and effectively support Iraqi Security Force and 
Coalition Force night operations-particularly  in conjunction 
with Coalition Special Operations Forces.  Release of 
AN-AVS-9 Night Vision Goggles will greatly enhance their 
ability to conduct counter-terrorism missions, improve 
interoperability with Coalition forces, and improve their 
ability to maintain their own defense and security. Fielding 
a modern capable NVG that improves night vision capability 
will also contribute to eventual Coalition advisory 
transition of Iraqi aviation assets to independent operations. 
 
 
Iraq Safeguarding Sensitive Technology 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Iraq has demonstrated the intent and ability to 
protect sensitive, classified military technology since 
working with U.S. and Coalition forces. An Article 505 
agreement (signed by the GOI July 24, 2004) demonstrates 
Iraq's commitment to protect grant defense articles and 
technology similar to our standards. Additionally, a 
Memorandum of Agreement for Compliance for the Storage, 
Security and Inventory of Night Vision Devices was signed by 
the Iraqi MOD, 18 November 2005.  We will continue to mentor 
the GOI on their protection of sensitive USG technology in 
order to provide long-term cooperation with Iraq. We also 
will obtain all necessary formal agreements with the GOI 
before transferring any sensitive equipment or technology. 
Lastly, we will continue to carry out a robust end-use 
monitoring (EUM) through the GOLDEN SENTRY program. 
 
Anticipated Reaction from Neighboring Nations 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) We do not anticipate the release of AN/AVS-9 Night 
Vision Goggles to the Government of Iraq to adversely affect 
the regional balance of power or cause negative reactions 
from neighboring nations, as this system is already fielded 
in many countries of the region. 
 
Iraq's Political Importance to the Region 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) A stable, democratically-elected Iraqi government, 
capable of protecting its people and sovereignty, and 
remaining at peace with its neighbors is one of the USG's 
highest priorities.  The release and employment of AN/AVS-9 
Night Vision Goggles will facilitate progress toward this 
goal, advancing the Iraqi security forces' ability to 
identify, target and carry out night operations against 
anti-Iraqi forces while reducing the risk to self and others. 
 
Source of Financing and Economic Impact 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) This purchase will be financed by the USG using 
Iraqi Security Forces Funds.  The cost is estimated at $1.5M. 
There is no significant economic impact anticipated to be

generated by this sale. 
 
Relevant Human Rights Considerations 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶9. (SBU) There are no human rights considerations that should 
preclude the release of the defense equipment to the Iraqi 
Armed Forces. 
 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) We request immediate Washington approval for the 
release of the AN/AVS-9 Night Vision Goggles to the 
Government of Iraq.
