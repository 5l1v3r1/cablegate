SUBJECT:  SUDAN/DARFUR:  August 3 CFC Meeting in El Fasher 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On August 3, the Darfur Ceasefire Commission 
(CFC) met in El Fasher, North Darfur.  Para 2 presents the notes of 
the U.S. CFC representative.  Noteworthy is the resumption of SLM/M 
participation and the CFC decision to launch an immediate 
investigation into the fighting in Jebel Moon and Kulkul, despite 
the strenuous objections of SAF representatives.  The U.S. Observer 
to the CFC is pressing to keep the Jebel Moon and Kulkul reports on 
the front burner.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The U.S. Observer's notes are as follows: 
 
The Monday CFC meeting was a bit more productive than the recent 
past.  On a good note, the U.S. Observer to the CFC spent Monday 
morning with SLA (M) CFC reps Col Ali Mukhtar and Adam War, and 
convinced them to end the SLA (M) boycott of CFC meetings.  They had 
boycotted CFC because of a lack of response from AMIS to letters SLA 
(M) had written, requesting various support. 
 
The meeting lasted a little over an hour, and was highlighted by a 
CFC decision to launch an immediate investigation into reports of 
fighting in Jebel Moon and Kulkul.  The decision came over the very 
strenuous objections of the GoS reps.  They attempted to block the 
CFC from taking a decision, citing the lack of standing of a written 
complaint from the JEM rep to the CFC on the violence.  The FC 
countered with a statement that the complaint had been brought up by 
the AU and UN jointly (joint statement from AU/UN in Khartoum on the 
violence), and that the CFC would act based on the AU/UN complaint. 
 
GoS countered that the Sector Ceasefire Sub Commission (SCSC) could 
be the only party to investigate, and that international observers 
to the CFC could not travel to the sectors to investigate.  I 
countered that the DPA, while not including international observers 
in the SCSCs, did not prohibit observers from the CFC in El Fasher 
from participating in investigations.  GoS then threw out the 
oft-used "It is not safe to go there--we can't guarantee your 
safety" argument.  The observers all pledged to the Chairman that 
they would travel together, anywhere, anytime in pursuit of an 
investigation, and that guarantees probably were never really 
possible in Darfur. 
 
In another development, the AU Observer, Navy Captain Waswa, asked 
the Chairman to re-think the issue of AMIS compliance with the GoS 
curfew in Darfur, stating that most illegal activities occur after 
curfew by parties who know that AMIS is not out patrolling.  The 
Chairman stated that the curfew was not as big deal as it used to 
be, and that, with prior GoS permission, AMIS has been allowed to 
venture out after curfew.  He offered examples of medical 
emergencies, FC attending "functions" after hours, etc.  The AU and 
U.S. reps responded that the value of free access of AMIS, 24 hours 
a day, would serve a deterrent function and demonstrate AMIS will to 
operate across Darfur.  No audible response from the Chairman to the 
comments from AU and U.S. reps. 
 
Last, the Chairman announced that an AMIS helicopter has been shot 
at on Tuesday morning, approx 26 km from Nyala, on its way to 
Sheiria.  An employee of PAE (reported to be a Liberian national) 
was shot in the foot.  Injuries were not life-threatening.  At last 
report the employee had been transferred to Khartoum for treatment. 
The Chairman tasked the GoS and movement reps to find out who had 
done the shooting.  The area in which the helo was operating is 
reported to be SLA(W)- controlled territory. 
 
The FC traveled to Addis Wednesday to attend the Joint Commission 
meeting on Thursday, 3 Aug.  The next CFC meeting is scheduled for 
Monday, 7 Aug. in El Fasher. 
 
The U.S. Observer to the CFC is pressing to keep the Jebel Moon and 
Kulkul reports on the front burner at the CFC.  There is support 
from the UN and AU observers on this -- the EU observer is in France 
on leave until 15 Aug.  Any help from Khartoum, Addis, and 
Washington to keep this on the mind of AMIS leadership and AU 
leadership would be helpful.
