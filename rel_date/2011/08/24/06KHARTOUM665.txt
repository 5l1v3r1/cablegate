¶1.  The following is a summary of the 2006 Government of 
Southern Sudan (GoSS) budget.  The total budget is just 
over USD 1.3 billion.  Revenues for 2005 were around USD 
700 million, although the government is projecting oil 
revenues, by far the largest share of income, will 
increase significantly in 2006.  The largest sector is 
infrastructure development, with a total of USD 305 
million (23.3 percent of the total budget), followed by 
security (USD 220 million, 16.8 percent), education (USD 
140 million, 10.7 percent) and health (USD 110 million, 
8.4 percent).  The budget also earmarks over USD 250 
million as reserves (19.1 percent).

¶2.  The largest budget for a single ministry is SPLA 
Affairs, with USD 200 million (15.3 percent).  The 
Ministry of Transport and Roads is the next largest 
beneficiary (USD 165 million, 12.6 percent), followed by 
the Ministry of Education (USD 140 million, 10.7 
percent), the Ministry of Housing, Lands and Public 
Utilities (USD 120 million, 9.2 percent), and the

budget is only a portion of the money being expended for 
government-type functions, as it does not include 
projects financed through donations from the 
international community.
