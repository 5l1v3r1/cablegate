ACTION REQUESTS 
--------------- 
 
¶1.  Action Requests:  Ambassador or appropriate senior 
officials at Embassy Kigali is requested to deliver 
the text in paragraph 5 as a letter over Post 
Official's signature to either the host government's 
Foreign minister or, if known, the host government's 
Designated Minister-level head of official delegation to 
WIREC 2008.  Post at its discretion may cc other 
ministers who have indicated an interest in attending 
WIREC.  Post is asked to confirm delivery of the 
letter via return cable.  Please include name and 
contact information for post's WIREC POC in the 
response cable. 
 
¶2.  Post is are requested to inform the GOR 
that Official Individual Country Ministerial-level 
delegations may consist of a maximum of 10 individuals 
per country, composed of up to three Ministers, 
including the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Energy, 
Agriculture, or Environment (or the equivalent Ministers 
covering those portfolios) and three subnational 
government representatives.  We defer to each country's 
Minister of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to determine their 
country's precise makeup of the 'Official WIREC 
Ministerial Delegation,' as well as to inform us of 
their 'Head of Delegation,' assuming more than one 
Minister-level delegate is part of that country's 
official delegation.  However, we appreciate Embassy 
engagement with the MFA to ensure that the delegation 
is comprised of appropriate Ministers and subnational 
government representatives. 
 
¶3.  Post is requested to inform the host government 
that each member of the delegation must submit an 
individual registration form to confirm attendance 
at WIREC 2008.  Official delegates may register 
for the conference via the internet at http:// 
www.usea.org/WIREC/official party registration pub 0001.pdf. 
 
¶4. The German Government has offered to sponsor travel 
of Eng. Albert Butare, Minister of State in charge of 
energy and communications, Ministry of Infrastructure, 
who is invited to serve as a panelist on renewable energy 
in Africa at a German-sponsored side event.  OES has 
provided the Germans with an individual invitation for 
Butare to allow him to attend, although we rely on the 
GOR to determine whether he will be part of the official 
Rwandan delegation to WIREC.  We have only very limited 
sponsorship funds available and there may not be any 
other funds available for Rwandan delegates.

TEXT OF LETTER

¶5.  Begin text of the letter: 
 
Dear Mr./Madam Minister: (or other appropriate salutation) 
 
The U.S. State Department will host the Washington 
International Renewable Energy Conference (WIREC 2008) 
in Washington on March 4-6, 2008.  WIREC 2008 is the 
third global ministerial-level event on renewable energy 
after Bonn in 2004 and Beijing in 2005.  WIREC will 
serve as a global platform for ministers and senior 
leaders from the private sector, sub-national 
governments, and civil society to discuss and share 
information about the benefits of renewable energy, 
identify best practices and barriers, and consider 
policy options and measures needed to encourage the 
rapid development of renewable energy in their 
countries. 
 
I am pleased to invite (insert name of country) to send an 
official delegation to WIREC 2008.  Approximately 2,000 
delegates will participate in the three-day conference at 
the Washington Convention Center, and we envision 
participation by U.S. Cabinet secretaries and senior 
White House officials. 
 
In the spirit of the International Action Program that was 
agreed to at the Bonn Conference, I am inviting your 
government to consider making a voluntary national pledge 
at WIREC to accelerate the deployment of renewable energy 
in your country.  The consolidation of national 
governments' pledges, as well as pledges from other major 
stakeholders (sub-national governments, international 
organizations, the private sector, civil society, and 
multi-stakeholder partnerships) will be one of the major 
outcomes of WIREC. 
 
I look forward to your official delegation's active 
Participation in WIREC 2008. 
 
Sincerely, 
(insert name of Ambassador or appropriate senior 
embassy official) 
 
End text.
