SUBJECT: UN FOURTH COMMITTEE DEBATE ON ISRAELI PRACTICES IN 
THE WEST BANK, GAZA, AND GOLAN. 
 
¶1. Summary: The UN General Assembly's Fourth Committee met 
November 4 - 6 to debate the annual "Report of the Special 
Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting Human 
Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the 
Occupied Territories" (the Special Committee).  The debate 
included statements from 29 states (mainly Arab and Muslim) 
and the Palestinian Observer Mission.  Most condemned 
Israel's "occupation," separation barrier and settlements 
construction, "collective punishment" against Palestinians, 
targeted killings, and obstruction of the free movement of 
Palestinians.  Israel deemed the report biased and stated 
that such rhetoric would not improve the Palestinian 
situation.  The Israeli delegate questioned Sudan, Syria, 
Iran, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) 
ability to speak on democracy and human rights, which they 
refuted in rights of reply.  Some states, such as Algeria, 
accused Israel of undermining the Annapolis process, while 
others, such as France on behalf of the EU, encouraged the 
parties to bolster negotiations.  End Summary. 
 
Report of the Special Committee 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. Chairperson of the Special Committee, H.M.G.S. Palihakkara 
of Sri Lanka, said that despite the continuation of the 
Annapolis process, the human rights situation in Gaza and the 
West Bank had deteriorated.  As with past reports, the 
Chairperson condemned Israeli military incursions, continued 
restrictions on goods and people, and construction of the 
separation barrier and expansion of settlements.  The report 
alleged that Israel once again denied the Committee access to 
"the occupied territories." 
 
General Debate 
-------------- 
 
¶3. Palestinian Observer Mission: The Palestinian 
representative accused Israel of conducting extrajudicial 
killings, violent military attacks, and destruction of homes. 
 In Gaza, the representative said that 80 percent of the 
population relies on food aid; over 90 percent of industry, 
business, and workshops are closed; and 50 percent of the 
workforce is unemployed.   In the West Bank, she said that 
Israel continues imposing restrictions on movement, noting 
the "permit regime" and military checkpoints.  On the peace 
process, the representative stated that while they were 
engaged with "the Israeli side," the aforementioned 
violations continue. 
 
¶4. Israel: The Israeli delegate stated that 2007 had 
witnessed the most substantial negotiations since 2000. 
However, the delegate lamented the biased nature of the 
report, stating that it did not take into account the 
well-being of Israeli citizens, among other issues.  He also 
stated that such rhetoric would have no bearing on the 
Palestinian situation.  He highlighted that Israel does not 
seek to hide its human rights record, but rather welcomes the 
U.S. Department of State, the EU, UN bodies, and NGOs to 
examine its record.  The delegate said that it was absurd 
that "bastions of democracy, including Sudan, North Korea, 
Iran, and Syria, lecture the open and free state of Israel." 
 
¶5. Syria and Iran: The Syrian delegate accused Israel of 
deliberately and methodically altering the Golan and called 
its "occupation" "a crime against humanity."  He added that 
Israel refused to de-mine territory, stating that its mines 
had killed over 200 people.  The Iranian delegate accused 
Israel of several alleged crimes, including collective 
punishment, executions, and torture.  He urged organizations 
and the media to publicize the situation in the West Bank and 
Gaza.  Both delegations also responded to Israel's statement 
during their right of reply. 
 
¶6. DPRK: The North Korean delegate accused Israel of 
committing human rights atrocities, stating that thousands of 
Palestinians were "groaning" in Israeli prisons.  He argued 
that measures to end the "Middle East conflict" had been 
compromised by "certain countries" that tolerate Israel's 
"occupation" and human rights violations, and supported 
Israel politically, militarily, and economically. 
 
Comments on the Annapolis Process 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶7. France on behalf of the EU and Uganda:  The French 
delegate welcomed the Israeli and Palestinian parties' 
efforts to continue negotiations and encouraged them to "take 
bold steps" within the Annapolis process.  The Ugandan 
 
USUN NEW Y 00001074  002 OF 002 
 
 
delegate reiterated support for resuming direct negotiations 
and called for the Quartet (i.e., U.S., EU, Russia, UN) to 
renew efforts to bolster the peace process. 
 
¶8. Algeria, Pakistan, and Sudan: The Algerian delegate said 
that while the Annapolis Conference had tried to renew the 
peace process, Israel's "genocidal policy" continues.  The 
delegate accused "certain Security Council members" of 
encouraging Israel's "attitude."  The Pakistani delegate 
stated that the Annapolis Conference required immediate 
confidence-building measures and criticized Israel for 
undermining the process.  The Sudanese delegate called on 
Israel to uphold its commitment, consistent with the 
Annapolis Conference and the Road Map, to creating a 
Palestinian state.
