Provincial Officials Highlight Security Concerns 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador met with Provincial Governor Arsala 
Jamal and members of the Provincial Council (PC) during his 
October 29 visit to Khost Province.  The Governor and PC 
members spoke at length about the close cooperation they had 
with the U.S. Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Khost. 
They reported that security had improved in the province 
since the PRT began operations but underlined it remains a 
concern.  They stressed the importance of military forces 
respecting Islam as they carry out operations.  Provincial 
Council chairman Dawood Khan Shaheedzoi cited the need for 
close cooperation between U.S. and Afghan security forces and 
the community in order to avoid misunderstandings and errors. 
 He claimed that two local residents had been arrested based 
on false intelligence.  He also complained about a former 
Taliban commander accepted into the Program Takh-i-Sol (PTS, 
the reconciliation program) having been subsequently 
arrested.  Governor Jamal broached the subject of raising 
security personnel from among local tribes and paying them 
from national funds according to national doctrine as a way 
to strengthen community policing efforts. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador underscored the U.S. commitment to PTS, 
saying that it was vital that Taliban who want to return to a 
decent, peaceful life should be able to so.  He also stressed 
the importance monitoring and, if need be, enforcement to 
ensure that reconcilees meet their obligations to the 
community.  Ambassador said the U.S. is committed to working 
in partnership with Afghan authorities, saying this is the 
way to produce the optimum political and security outcome in 
all our operations.  He underlined U.S. respect for Islam. 
He offered condolences for the death of a PC member, due to a 
heart attack, following the October 25 suicide attack on a 
PRT convoy in which the Governor and the PC member were 
passengers. 
 
Development Also a Priority 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Governor Jamal and the PC members highlighted the 
importance of development to the Province.  They said the 
Khost-Gardez road remained the main priority for the region, 
as it would mean more mobility of people and goods. 
Hospitals, electricity, agriculture projects, infrastructure, 
and trade development were also on their wish list.  The 
Khost-Gardez road issue was also raised at a press conference 
during the visit.  The Ambassador committed to an effort to 
keep the Khost-Gardez pass free of snow over the winter and 
said that U.S.-funded construction and paving efforts would 
begin in spring 2008.  Ambassador highlighted in each meeting 
that more assistance was going to Khost Province during the 
current year than had been provided in the five previous 
years. 
 
SPIRITED DISCUSSION WITH STUDENTS 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The Ambassador also met with a group of Khost 
 
KABUL 00003772  002 OF 002 
 
 
University and area madrassa students who asked questions 
about the U.S. view of Islam, the links between 9/11 and the 
U.S. decision to attack the Taliban, and U.S. long-term 
interests in Afghanistan.  The Ambassador underlined U.S. 
respect for Islam and religious education, adding that 
students should be able to study and teachers should be able 
to teach whatever subjects they chose.  He noted that the 
U.S. had been involved in development in Afghanistan for 
decades, but it was Al-Qai'da's use of Afghanistan as a base 
to attack the U.S. that had been the basis for a decision to 
reestablish a presence.  The U.S. is committed to a long-term 
partnership with Afghanistan, supporting security and 
development. 
 
KHOST MPs HIGHLIGHT GOVERNMENT'S DISCONNECT AND PRAISE PRT 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) During their meeting in Kabul with the Ambassador 
two days before his trip to the province, Khost MPs expressed 
concern over what they described as a growing disconnect 
between the government and the people.  They also underlined 
the need for security forces to work with local leaders 
during operations to avoid errors and undermining confidence 
in the efforts.  MP Liaqatullah Babakrakhial claimed there 
had been several recent instances of what he described as 
mistaken identity leading to improper arrests.  The MPs also 
flagged concern over the lack of development.  Amir Khan 
Sabri, MP on the Communication and Transportation Committee 
of the Wolesi Jirga, highlighted that there are no hospitals 
and little electricity in the province. (Note: In fact there 
is currently a main hospital in Khost that is functional; a 
new hospital project in the province will be funded via 
CERP.)  MP Mawlavi Hanif Shah Hussaini and other MPs 
underscored the positive role played by the PRT in 
development in the province and welcomed further efforts.
