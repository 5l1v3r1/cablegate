SUBJECT: KAGAME SWEARS IN TWO NEW SENATORS 
 
¶1. (U) President Kagame on September 10 administered the oath 
of office to two new senators, Josee Kagabo and Henriette 
Umulisa, filling two vacancies.  One was left by Stanley 
Safari, who fled Rwanda in June in the middle of his gacaca 
trial.  (Note:  He subsequently received a life sentence for 
genocide-related crimes.  End Note.)  The other was left by 
Beatrice Mukabaranga, who resigned following allegations that 
she had bounced three personal checks.  Immediately after the 
swearing-in, Kagame reminded all parliamentarians present 
that the goal of their work was not to prepare excellent 
legislation or give great speeches, but to ensure that their 
work personally and positively touched citizens throughout 
the country.  COMMENT:  Kagame routinely takes officials to 
task in a very public fashion, urging them to work harder, 
faster, better.  This ceremony was no exception.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Bio data on the new senators follows. 
 
JOSEE KAGABO is a French-Rwandan dual national who is a 
professor of history at the University of Paris X.  He was a 
member of the Rwandan government's "Mucyo" commission, which 
investigated and published in 2008 a lengthy report alleging 
French complicity in the 1994 genocide.  He is a member of 
the ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF). 
 
HENRIETTE UMULISA is less well-known than Kagabo.  She was a 
schoolteacher at the Ecole Belge de Kigali, and is a graduate 
of the Brussels Catholic Business Institute.  Her father, Dr. 
Musafiri Ildephonse, was a former Health Minister under 
former President Habyarimana, Rwanda's head of state from 
1973-1994.  She is also a member of the RPF.
