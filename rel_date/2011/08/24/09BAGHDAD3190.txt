¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: In the 6-month Sisyphean effort to get the 
GOI to properly utilize humanitarian support for demining, it 
appears that a rock has finally crested the hill.  On 
November 6, our largest Iraqi grantee, the Iraqi Mine 
Clearance Organization (IMCO), announced that it received GOI 
accreditation.  This approval came after a constructive 
October 31 meeting that emboffs hosted at the Embassy with 
Deputy MinEnv Kamal Hussein Latif, MOD Follow-through 
Director MG Hadi al-Qaisi, and a UNDP representative.  All 
sides resolved sticking points that had been preventing the 
accreditation of particular demining NGOs.  On the operations 
front, MinDef Abd al-Qadir al-Mufriji consented November 9, 
on Pol-Mil MinCouns' urging, to approve more demining 
projects in future as long as the proposed operations did not 
involve borders or sensitive infrastructure.  To underscore 
the need for swift action on such approvals, emboff and 
military liaisons met with MOD General Secretary LTG Salih 
Sarhan Hussein November 18, and he agreed to urge the MinDef 
to approve at least a small set of feasible, purely 
humanitarian projects very soon, which IMCO says they have 
received.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GRADUAL UN-FREEZING OF DEMINING 
------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) MOD officials imposed a freeze on all demining 
activity at the end of 2008 but lifted it July 7, 2009 by 
signing an agreement with the MOEnv to share control of 
demining operations.  However, since that time both 
ministries had failed to approve humanitarian demining 
projects.  Meanwhile, the Embassy and UNAMI have coached the 
MOEnv and MOD towards cooperating better with each other, 
accrediting humanitarian demining organizations, and 
approving actual clearance projects (reftel).  IMCO Director 
Zahim Mutar told Iraqi news media November 18 that IMCO would 
begin clearance work in Basra and Baghdad.  Zahim clarified 
to emboff November 19 that IMCO is scheduled to start mine 
clearance south of Baghdad and quality control/assurance in 
Basra and Nissan.  Noting his excellent relationship with 
MOEnv and calmer waters with the MOD, Zahim predicted that 
other projects were forthcoming.  On December 2, IMCO was 
tasked to implement quality control/assurance tasks in the 
Canal Area of Baghdad, Abogharab oil field in southern Iraq, 
and the Al-Fao/Almaamer areas of Basra for areas recently 
cleared by the MOD. UNDP also expects more clearance work 
will be given to IMCO in 2010. 
 
MEASURING PROGRESS 
------------------ 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: The GOI has made progress incrementally in 
the field of mine action by: a) accrediting demining 
organizations (commercial and humanitarian), b) approving 
demining projects, and c) allowing NGOs such as IMCO to 
conduct mine risk education and quality control oversight. 
The penultimate benchmark of progress is IMCO's recent 
approval to conduct humanitarian mine clearance, and the 
final benchmark will be met when IMCO once again removes and 
destroys landmines or unexploded ordnance in the course of a 
purely humanitarian project. Additionally, U.S. forces are 
receiving regular reports that the GOI, through the MOD, has 
also made considerable efforts in demining and clearing 
remnants of war in the area of the 10th IA by that unit. END 
COMMENT.
