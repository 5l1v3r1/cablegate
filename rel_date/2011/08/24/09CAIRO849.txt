We delivered demarche in reftel A to gauge Egyptian interest 
in a follow-up Quint dialogue.  The Egyptians reponded on May 
16 that they agree to the idea of holding the next meeting in 
late summer or early fall, noting their understanding from 
the November 2008 meeting that the Jordanians have expressed 
interest in hosting.
