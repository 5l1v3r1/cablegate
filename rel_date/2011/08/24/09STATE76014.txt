SUBJECT: DIPLOMATIC NOTE REQUESTING RUSSIAN PARTICIPATION 
IN ITWG TASK GROUP ON INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN NUCLEAR 
FORENSICS 
 
REF: A. MOSCOW 001461 
     ¶B. STATE 055511 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request for Embassy Moscow.  Please 
see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BACKGROUND: The Department is grateful for the 
Government of Russia's (GOR) active participation at the 14th 
annual meeting of the International Technical Working Group 
on Nuclear Smuggling (ITWG) hosted by the IAEA and valued 
interacting with Russian colleagues. Most importantly, the 
Department is pleased to learn that the GOR has informed 
leadership in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and 
Rosatom of Washington's proposal to strengthen international 
nuclear forensics cooperation described in REF B.  The 
Department remains hopeful that the GOR will continue to 
provide leadership on nuclear smuggling issues and 
participate in international efforts to strengthen 
cooperation in nuclear forensics. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  The Department requests that post 
pass the diplomatic note in paragraph 4 to the appropriate 
host government officials and encourage continued Russian 
participation in the ITWG task group detailed below. 
 
¶4. (SBU) INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE IN TASK GROUP: 
 
(complimentary opening) ... and has the honor to request the 
Ministry's support of Russian experts' participation in joint 
studies of the use of national nuclear forensics libraries to 
promote international cooperation on combating nuclear 
terrorism. 
 
The Russian Federation and United States have worked 
effectively together on several nuclear security and 
terrorism issues, and this collaboration is strongly evident 
in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) 
and underscored in the Joint Statement on Nuclear Cooperation 
issued by Presidents Obama and Medvedev on July 6.  At the 
fifth GICNT plenary, the Joint Co-Chairs' Statement 
identified nuclear forensics, inter alia, as a focus area 
over the coming year given the value of these techniques to 
governments in investigating illicit uses of nuclear 
material. 
 
In response to a GICNT recommendation for a briefing at the 
2010 plenary, the International Technical Working Group on 
Nuclear Smuggling (ITWG) established a task group to review 
the concept of national nuclear forensics libraries as a 
basis to promote international cooperation.  The ITWG is an 
experts group that was formed by the G-8 in the mid 1990s and 
is the most active multilateral entity working on nuclear 
forensics issues. 
 
In preparation for the briefing, the ITWG task group will 
conduct a technical review of the forensics library concept, 
and as a first step, prepare a Terms of Reference.  In the 
coming weeks, a draft will be circulated for comment, and in 
the coming months, the group plans to meet in Europe to 
continue its technical review.  The first meeting of the task 
group occurred on July 1 and included experts from several 
countries including Mr. V. Erastov from Rosatom. 
 
Given the Russian Federation's unique expertise in nuclear 
forensics and cooperative activities -- for example, between 
the Bochvar Institute and the European Union's Institute of 
Transuranic Elements (ITU) -- the United States as a co-chair 
of the task group sees great value in Russian participation. 
The Embassy has the honor to express its hope that the 
Government of Russia will facilitate the participation of 
Russian experts in this activity. 
 
(complimentary closing) 
 
¶5. (SBU) REPORTING DEADLINE:  Department requests that post 
respond via front-channel cable no later than July 31, 2009. 
 
¶6. Department appreciates Post's assistance.  Contact Michael 
Curry (currymr@state.gov, 202-736-7692) in ISN/WMDT for more 
information.
