SUBJECT: AMERICAN JOURNALISTS SUCCESSFULLY USE NEW 
ZIMBABWEAN ACCREDITATION PROCEDURES 
 
 
¶1. THE SOUTHERN AFRICA CORRESPONDENTS FOR THE NEW YORK 
TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON POST SUCCESSFULLY USED THE NEW 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HARARE  02327  031030Z 
MEDIA ACCREDITATION PROCEDURES PUT INTO PLACE BY 
ZIMBABWEAN INFORMATION MINISTER JONATHAN MOYO IN JUNE 
¶2001.  THE JOHANNESBURG-BASED JOURNALISTS ARRIVED IN 
ZIMBABWE AUGUST 1 AND 3 AND INTEND TO SPEND ABOUT A WEEK 
IN THE COUNTRY COVERING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES. 
 
¶2. THE JOURNALISTS FOLLOWED THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED 
PROCEDURE OF APPLYING FOR PERMISSION, ON COMPANY 
LETTERHEAD, TO ENTER ZIMBABWE ONE MONTH IN ADVANCE OF 
ARRIVAL.  THEY DEALT DIRECTLY WITH THE MINISTRY OF 
INFORMATION IN HARARE RATHER THAN THROUGH THE ZIMBABWEAN 
HIGH COMMISSION IN SOUTH AFRICA.  IN RESPONSE TO THE 
APPLICATIONS, THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION SENT 
"INVITATION" LETTERS TO THE CORRESPONDENTS IN 
JOHANNESBURG.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE AIRPORT IN HARARE, 
THE JOURNALISTS PRESENTED THESE LETTERS TO IMMIGRATION 
OFFICIALS AND WERE ALLOWED TO ENTER WITH THE INSTRUCTION 
TO REPORT THE NEXT DAY TO THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION TO 
GET THEIR VISA/ACCREDITATION.  UPON PAYMENT OF THE USD 
100 FEE, THE WASHINGTON POST CORRESPONDENT WAS GIVEN A 
VISA/CREDENTIAL VALID FOR 9 DAYS, THE AMOUNT OF TIME HE 
REQUESTED.  THIS FEE MUST BE PAID EACH TIME THE 
JOURNALIST ENTERS ZIMBABWE.  THE NEW YORK TIMES 
REPORTERS ARE TO REPORT TO THE MINISTRY LATER TODAY. 
 
¶3. IN THIS CASE THE NEW ACCREDITATION PROCEDURE FOR 
FOREIGN JOURNALISTS WORKED EXACTLY AS ADVERTISED BY 
MINISTER MOYO.  THE JOURNALISTS TELL US THAT MINISTRY 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY "WILL BE FLEXIBLE" IF A BREAKING 
STORY IN ZIMBABWE MAKES ADVANCE APPLICATION FOR A VISA 
IMPRACTICAL.  WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITIES TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  02327  031030Z 
TEST THE MINISTRY'S FLEXIBILITY IN THE MONTHS TO COME. 
WE WILL ALSO WATCH WITH INTEREST TO SEE IF UNFLATTERING 
REPORTING ON ZIMBABWE MAKE THE VISA/ACCREDITATION 
PROCESS MORE DIFFICULT.
