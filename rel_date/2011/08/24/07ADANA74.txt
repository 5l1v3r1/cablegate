¶5.      GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:       DTP National Chairperson Ahmet 
Turk cautioned people against statements made following the 
bombing incident in Ankara adding that such statements, which 
aimed to provoke Turkish people, could force Turkey to take a 
dangerous path.  Evrensel daily claims that the Turkish media 
readily claimed the PKK was responsible for the Ankara bombing 
despite its announcements denying links with the incident and to 
the evidence. 
 
¶6.      CUMHURIYET:     The daily claims that the Ankara suicide bomb 
attack followed the statements of Abdullah Ocalan, who said that 
"my health condition is bad; something must be done about it." 
The PKK had already announced in the recent months that it would 
start suicide missions. 
 
¶7.      GUNDEM: A total of 37 DYP members resigned from DYP in 
the Elazig province which is the hometown of the DYP leader

resigning members said they would settle in the coming days whom 
they would support in the future. 
 
¶8.      GUNDEM: Mardin's Families of the Inmates Initiative 
will start a hunger strike to call for an independent delegation 
of doctors to check the health condition of Abdullah Ocalan in 
the Imrali Prison Island.  Meanwhile, the hunger strikes that

controlled mines in rural sections of Sirnak's Guclukonak 
district and Siirt's Pervari district, announced the Siirt 
Governor's Office.  Ten security officers were wounded, three 
seriously.  The Gundem daily claims that the soldiers died in a 
conflict between security forces and PKK members, not because of 
mine blasts as announced by the authorities. 
 
¶10.     BOLGE / SABAH (GUNEY):  Ebru Kara, the suicide bomber 
caught in Adana with 11 kilograms of A-4 plastic explosives (see 
press summary for May 24), reportedly said during her 
interrogation, "You are poisoning Apo (Abdullah Ocalan), 
therefore, I decided I would kill you."  Adana police said that 
they were alarmed for days since the day they got tip-off that 
well-dressed and groomed women would enter Turkey to carry out 
illegal activities.  The police said they were also looking into 
whether the suicide bomber, who headed towards Ceyhan district 
at the time when she was caught, was planning an attack against 
BTC pipeline or not.  Meanwhile, terrorist Adem Barik, who 
reportedly supplied explosives to suicide bomber Ebru Kara and 
helped her to come to Adana, was caught in Sanliurfa and brought 
to Adana by the police for interrogation. 
 
¶11.     YENI SAFAK:     Police detained 18 people, who were members of 
the DTP's Halfeti district party organization in Sanliurfa, on 
 
ADANA 00000074  002 OF 002

activities, shouted slogans in support for the terrorist 
organization, and carried flags which were used as symbols of 
the terrorist organization.  Four of the detainees were arrested 
later.

said that the area was not covered by the district's zoning

electricity networks. 
 
¶16.     GUNDEM: Police reportedly did not allow a group of
