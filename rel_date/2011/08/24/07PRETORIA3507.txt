¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: South Africa convened a two-day Energy Summit 
September 24-25 to engage with stakeholders in order to reassess its 
energy policy as set forth in the white paper on energy adopted in 
¶1998.  Noting the likelihood that key assumptions may have changed 
since that time, representatives of the SAG Department of Minerals 
and Energy (DME) debated the nation's policies on electricity, 
nuclear power, energy security, renewable energy and other aspects 
of energy policy.  There was broad consensus on the special role of 
the state, given South Africa's status as a "developmental state" 
and commitment to the provision of affordable energy services to its 
population.  The Minister reaffirmed the SAG's intent to consider 
enrichment of nuclear fuel and processing of spent fuel as 
delineated in its draft nuclear energy policy, but stressed the 
SAG's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation.  End Summary.

Energy Summit - Aiming at Improved Access 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The SAG Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) organized 
a September 24-25 Energy Summit in Johannesburg to foster 
stakeholder debate on the theme of "Energy Security for Sustainable 
and Shared Economic Growth for All."  Deputy President Phumzile 
Miama-Ngcuka opened the Energy Summit with a pre-recorded message 
highlighting South Africa's special challenge as a developing 
country reliant on significant energy imports, with the objective of 
improving access to basic energy needs to its people.  (Comment: The 
Deputy President was leading a delegation to Beijing.  End Comment.) 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Minister of Energy Buyelwa Sonjica applauded the start of 
extensive stakeholder consultation aimed at finding ways to 
streamline efficacy of energy policy and to identify policy gaps 
that may have developed over time.  Sonjica provided details on some 
specific initiatives, such as increasing nuclear power in the energy 
mix and implementing incentives to encourage renewable energy and 
energy efficiency.  The Minister attended the two full days of the 
summit, stressing that she was there to listen to stakeholders. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Department of Energy Director General Sandile Nogxino used 
his speech to highlight key considerations for the SAG's 
reassessment of energy policy: 
 
-- Increase access to affordable energy, with the goal of universal 
access by 2012; 
 
-- Improve energy governance, building on creation of the National 
Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) as an independent 
authority; 
 
-- Stimulate economic development, competition, and "cost reflective 
pricing"; 
 
-- Manage environmental consequences, given that SA's electricity is 
currently 92 percent reliant on burning coal. 
 
Nogxino emphasized that the importance of energy security had grown 
since 1998, noting that oil prices had increased from $10 to over 
$80 per barrel.  The Department of Transportation Director General 
Mpoumi Mpofu emphasized the importance of greater coordination 
between energy and transportation planning.

Boost and Diversify Electricity Generation 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Both Department of Energy and Public Enterprise 
representatives outlined the SAG's plans to double existing 42,000 
MW of installed capacity by 2027, by adding 20,000 MW of nuclear and 
20,000 MW of other conventional sources.  The SAG now targets 30 
percent provision by Independent Power Producers (IPP) and many 
 
PRETORIA 00003507  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
speakers applauded the recent award to an AES-led consortium as 
preferred bidder for the first IPP projects totaling 1,000 MW.  At 
the time of the 1998 policy review, the SAG planned to unbundle and 
liberalize state-owned electricity company Eskom, as well as 
encourage IPP's, in a then environment of excess capacity.  Since 
then, the SAG has been unsuccessful in providing incentives and a 
stable investment environment and now South Africa faces a shortfall 
in electricity capacity and reserve margin (the latter now less than 
8 percent).  The SAG has chosen state-owned Eskom to develop 
state-owned power projects and to serve as the single buyer of 
electricity for the grid.

Nuclear Power Quest 
------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Minister Sonjica emphasized in her speeches the target of 
a growing role for nuclear power in South Africa's energy mix as set 
forth in the recent nuclear energy policy (Ref A).  Eskom will 
designate Westinghouse or Areva of France to construct 4,000 MW over 
the near-term, followed by an incremental 16,000 MW targeted by 
¶2027.  Sonjica stressed that a key aspect of the recent draft 
nuclear energy policy is that South Africa must benefit from its 
uranium reserves and be able to assure security of supply, including 
developing new Pebble Bed Modulator Reactor technology as a part of 
its long-term new build.  Therefore, South Africa intends to 
maintain the option of developing low-grade enrichment of uranium 
and re-processing of spent fuel, while still maintaining all its 
non-proliferation obligations (Ref B).  In a separate session 
focused on safety and safeguards, SAG experts on non-proliferation 
(including Department of Foreign Affairs Deputy Director General 
Abdul Minty) and the domestic nuclear regulator emphasized SA's 
commitment to non-proliferation and safety, while stressing South 
Africa's right to consider uranium enrichment. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Aim to Implement National Modeling 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) One of the main themes of the Energy Summit was the desire 
to incorporate comprehensive modeling into planning efforts, drawing 
linkages with other sectors such as transport and public 
enterprises.  In a separate meeting, Department of Energy Deputy 
Director General Nhlanhla Gumede expressed to Resource/Energy 
Officer great interest in cooperating with the U.S. Energy 
Information Agency (EIA) in adapting appropriate modeling 
approaches, building from his participation in the April 2007 visit 
to Washington D.C.  As an immediate outcome of the visit, he 
arranged for EIA Deputy Administrator Susan Holt to address the 
summit, sharing U.S. best practices and experience with the National 
Energy Model (NEMS) approach.  She cautioned that NEMS was 
specifically developed for the U.S. energy market, but noted that 
Canada had successfully adapted it. 
 
------------------------------- 
Comment - the Role of the State 
------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) A recurrent theme at the Energy Summit was grappling with 
the role of the State.  There seemed to be broad consensus that the 
SAG bears a special responsibility as a "developmental state" to 
intervene in the sector to assure universal affordable access to 
energy for its population.  Labor played a prominent role at the 
summit, always expressing skepticism about the ability of capitalism 
and market forces to deliver this goal.  At one pause in the session 
focused on the role of the State, a number of labor representatives, 
all clad in dark leather jackets, and accompanied by the Energy 
Director General, broke out in spontaneous songs of solidarity.  In 
the wake of increased concerns about energy security and perceived 
failed attempts at privatization and liberalization around the globe 
(read: California), the SAG now aims to maintain Eskom as national 
champion for electricity generation and single buyer, but intends to 
develop almost one-third of the market as alternative independent 
power producers to augment competition and diversification.  AES'

Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) partner Mbane Power stated that 
South Africa still did not exhibit a "welcoming environment" and 
stated that investors faced high risk and uncertainty in looking at 
the South African market.
