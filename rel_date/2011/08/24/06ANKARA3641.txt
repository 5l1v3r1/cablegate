In Today's Papers 
 
Court Sentences Semdinli Suspects 
All papers report two Turkish non-commissioned officers in the 
jandarma, Ali Kaya and Ozcan Ildeniz, were sentenced by the Van 
criminal court to 39 years and 5 months each for last year's bombing 
of a bookstore in Semdinli in which one person was killed.  The 
court convicted Kaya and Ildeniz on charges of homicide, forming an 
armed gang and attempted murder.  The attack prompted riots in the 
mainly Kurdish region and a parliamentary inquiry that followed the 
unrest said the military may have orchestrated the attack to stir up 
trouble in the region in an effort to justify tougher methods in the 
fight against the separatist PKK.  The case has focused attention on 
Turkey's so-called deep state allegedly made up of nationalist 
elements of the military and judiciary.  In April, a prosecutor was 
sacked after he accused the Commander of Land Forces, General Yasar 
Buyukanit, of organizing an illegal group during his tenure in the 
region.  The case will go to the court of appeals. 
 
FM Gul at the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) Meeting 
Hurriyet, Radikal and others:  Addressing the OIC Foreign Ministers 
Conference in Baku, Gul said that Islamic countries need to make a 
comprehensive effort to implement reforms.  Reform in the Islamic 
world is a necessity, not a suggestion, Gul added.   Gul called on 
the OIC members for a more effective effort for the solution of the 
Cyprus issue.  Gul told his Iranian counterpart Mottaki that the 
incentive package prepared by the five permanent members of the 
United Nations Security Council is the last chance to find a 
solution to the nuclear standoff.  Gul, reportedly, conveyed a 
message to Mottaki that Turkey, as a neighbor of Iran, favors a 
diplomatic solution to the crisis and will continue to exert efforts 
in line with this position. 
 
Radikal reports that, while in Baku, FM Gul was received by 
President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.  The meeting focused on 
Kars-Tbilisi-Javakheti (Ahilkelek)-Baku railway project.  Gul 
stressed that Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia should come together to 
overcome several difficulties about the project.  Aliyev highlighted 
the importance of the inclusion of Kazakhstan in the pipeline 
project while the two leaders were discussing Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan 
oil pipeline. 
 
DTP (Democratic People's Party) Invites ETA and IRA to its 
Convention on June 25 
Milliyet, Yeni Safak: Preparing for its first Ordinary congress, the 
DTP included politicians, NGOs, authors and members of the ETA and 
IRA's political wing in its invitee list.  IRA and ETA are still on 
the terrorist organizations list of the US and the EU.  Deputy 
Chairman of DTP Alaattin Erdogan said that the Basque issue in Spain 
and the Northern Ireland issue in the UK have begun democratic and 
peaceful processes toward resolutions.  Edrogan further explained 
that as the Kurdish issue is similar to these countries' problems, 
the DTP wanted to hear about examples for dialog directly from their 
representatives. He added that the DTP believes that their 
contribution to resolving the Kurdish issue could be important. 
Both parties, reportedly, accepted the invitation and are going to 
send their representatives. 
 
Diplomatic Traffic 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul is to attend the "Paris Pact 
Initiative Ministerial Meeting" in Russia June 26-28 while he 
accompanies President Ahmet Necdet Sezer on his state visit to 
Moscow from June 28-30.  Gul announced earlier that he would travel 
to Washington on July 5.  Meanwhile, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar 
Zebari and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director 
General Muhammad al-Baradei are also expected to visit Turkey in 
July, with the latter coming to Ankara on the 6th for a three-day 
visit.

Top Business Group Urges 12 Years of Compulsory Education 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Cumhuriyet, Radikal, Zaman and others: 
The influential Turkish businessmen's group TUSIAD has issued a call 
for education reform in its report, "Education and Sustainable 
Growth--The Turkish Experience," proposing that compulsory education 
should be extended to 12 years (from the current eight years) and 
that the curriculum should be revised.  TUSIAD Chairman Omer Sabanci 
said Turkey was well behind other nations in developing human 
resources.  "Turkey's economy has the potential to maintain 7 
percent growth between 2006-2020, if investments are boosted in 
addition to the ties between productivity and human resources," he 
emphasized.  The report also calls for the reform of higher 
education, demanding competitive and creative universities.  The 
World Bank's Education Sector Study (ESS) had said in April that 
Turkey's education system needs comprehensive reform from top to 
bottom. 
 
 
Editorial Comment: Palestine, Israel and Arab Leaders 
Omer Taspinar, writing in Radikal, argues that, contrary to what 
logic might tell us, finding a solution to the Israel-Palestinian 
problem is against the interests of many Arab leaders:  "Once a 
Palestinian state is established, many authoritarian Arab regimes 
will find themselves in a very difficult position. The States of 
Palestine and Israel living in peace side by side poses a potential 
threat to Arab leaders.  If and when this happens, Arab public 
opinion will naturally focus on in-house issues, such as oppressive 
and incompetent regimes.  In the absence of a Palestinian problem, 
Arab regimes will undoubtedly face growing pressure for 
democratization.  In a nutshell, the continuation of the Palestinian 
issue means prolonged rule for Arab dictators, so they don't 
genuinely desire that a solution be found."
