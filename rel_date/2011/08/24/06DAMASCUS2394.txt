¶1.  (SBU) The Syrian Ministry of Interior (MOI) responded on 
May 7 to Post's February 2, 2006 diplomatic note with 
statistics about the number of persons arrested in 2005 on 
charges of trafficking in persons.  According to the 
diplomatic note, in the last nine months of 2005, authorities 
had arrested more than 28 persons on charges of 
"trafficking," including to Lebanon, Turkey, Italy and 
Greece.  Some of the charges also involved the "trafficking" 
of persons from one third country to another, such as the 
case of a suspect charged with trafficking of Syrian citizens 
from Ukraine to Germany." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The MOI did not explain whether it had 
distinguished trafficking in persons from smuggling, and it 
has not responded to a February written request for a meeting.
