¶1. (SBU) Emboff made reftel points on Iraqi assets to Ricardo 
Liao, head of the Central Bank Office for the Combat of 
Illicit Financial Activities, and to Marcos Pinta Gama, head 
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office for the Combat of 
Illicit International Activities, in meetings June 9 and 16, 
respectively.  Liao outlined to Emboff the steps that the GoB 
has taken to implement UNSCR 1483.  He explained that the 
Central Bank, acting pursuant to a presidential decree 
implementing UNSCR 1483, had issued a circular notice to all 
banks requiring them to verify whether they had any accounts 
in the names of the persons or entities listed by the UN. 
Similar action was taken by the Brazilian Securities and 
Exchange Commission with regard to investment firms.  To 
date, no matches with the Iraq lists had been reported. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Liao acknowledged that the GoB is dependent on 
banks' efforts to comply with the UNSC-mandated sanctions. 
Emboff pointed out to both Pinta Gama and Liao that many new 
Iraqi entities had been added to the UN Sanctions Committee 
lists since the circular had been issued and suggested it 
might be useful to remind the financial institutions to 
maintain vigilance and update their databases with the latest 
UN lists.  Pinta Gama agreed to issue a circular notice to 
the banks informing them of the updated UN lists. 
 
¶3. (U) Note: Reftel did not list post as an action addressee, 
but we took action based on an email request from WHA.
