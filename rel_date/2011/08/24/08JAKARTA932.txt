SUBJECT: Bill Gates Attends Government Leaders Forum Asia 
 
¶1. (U) During the May 8-9 Microsoft Government Leaders Forum (GLF) 
in Jakarta, Bill Gates praised President Yudhoyono for personally 
leading Indonesia's national committee on information technology and 
for setting ambitious goals.  Gates said that while not all of 
Indonesia's goals in information technology will likely be 
achievable in current timeframes, having lofty goals in itself is a 
best practice as it serves as a driver towards achievement. 
Yudhoyono highlighted the USAID/MCC-supported E-Procurement system 
as an example of Indonesia's effort to promote electronic governance 
in order to streamline processes and improve transparency. Over 200 
government leaders and private sector participants from other Asian 
countries attended the forum that focused on education, health and 
economic development. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During the forum, Microsoft President Director for 
Indonesia Tony Chen told Embassy staff that hosting the GLF 
Conference in Jakarta was a boon to both Microsoft Indonesia and to 
the Indonesian government.  He thanked Embassy staff for assistance, 
emphasizing the important role Ambassador Hume played in allaying 
Microsoft leadership's security concerns. Hume's trip to Redmond, 
Washington was one of the important factors in Microsoft's decision 
to hold the forum in Jakarta. 
 
3.(SBU) On the sides of the forum, a Gates Foundation official 
queried Embassy staff on latest developments in avian influenza 
sample sharing and on recent Ministry of Health actions barring 
NAMRU-2 from receiving samples.  He noted that Indonesian media had 
mischaracterized the Gates Foundation's interest in avian influenza 
assistance to Indonesia.  The Gates Foundation was interested in 
working on new vaccine development technologies that would 
ultimately eliminate chronic global vaccine shortages years from 
now.  The Foundation was not planning on specific assistance to 
Indonesia to develop an avian influenza vaccine. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  On May 9, Bill Gates spoke to 2,000 assembled government 
officials and students at a Presidential Lecture organized by the 
Kadin Secretariat.  During the event, Gates recognized a student 
group from Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) as the national of a 
Microsoft sponsored innovation competition and also announced that 
Universitas Pelita Harapan has been named the fifth Indonesian 
university that will host a Microsoft innovation center.
