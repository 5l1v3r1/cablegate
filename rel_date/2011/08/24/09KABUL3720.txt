SUBJECT: EXBS 2009 PROGRAM PLAN FOR AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: SECSTATE 112172 
 
¶1. (U) Post concurs with reftel's proposed programming but 
recommends modifications to three items: 
 
--Cross Border training for Afghan, Tajik, Uzbek, and Turkmen 
Customs officers at Towraghundi, Heratan, Shir Kan Bandar, Torkham, 
and Islan Qalah:  Security and lodging concerns at these locations 
requires changing the training dates and identifying alternative 
sites for training venues.  EXBS Afghanistan will work with the EXBS 
Advisors in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and the Border 
Management Task Force (BMTF) to conduct the training at sites where 
adequate security and lodging are available. 
 
--Training room renovations at the Kabul International Airport and 
Afghan Customs Department: The contracts for these two projects will 
be postponed until March 2010 to allow EXBS sufficient time to 
conduct assessments, draft a Statement of Work, and contract a 
company to do the work. 
 
--Afghan Customs Department training scheduled for 2009:  All of the 
Department of Homeland Security/Customs and Border Protection 
(DHS/CBP) training slated for 2009 must be postponed into 2010. EXBS 
has not received any projected dates from DHS/CBP for the training. 
EXBS will require two months of lead time to organize participants 
and venues. 
 
¶2. (U) Post appreciates Department's support of the EXBS program.
