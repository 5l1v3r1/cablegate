Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 7, Poloff met with GVN MFA officials to 
deliver Ref A's points for NAM summit attendees.  These officials 
indicated that the GVN will support the Guatemalan candidacy.  On 
the issue of terrorism, the GVN opposes any type of terrorist act 
against civilians.  Concerning democracy, they do not expect the NAM 
Final Document to endorse any country-specific political transition. 
 Finally, concerning the Middle East, the GVN will follow any NAM 
consensus reached on this language.  End summary. 
 
Venezuela-Guatemala 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On September 7, Poloff met with MFA International 
Organizations Department Assistant Director Pham Vinh Quang to 
deliver Ref A's points for NAM summit attendees.  Concerning the 
UNSC election contest between Guatemala and Venezuela, Mr. Quang 
said the NAM normally does not take sides on such issues, but rather 
offers general support for NAM members to obtain UN posts.  The 
Guatemala-Venezuela contest is a regional, Latin American issue. 
The GVN has been in contact with Guatemala "with positive 
correspondence," Quang added.  (Note:  This tracks with previous 
statements from GVN officials; Refs B and C.  End Note.) 
 
Terrorism 
--------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Concerning the definition of terrorism in the NAM Final 
Document, Quang said the issue of excluding acts of "national 
liberation movements" has been discussed for five years already 
without reaching a consensus.  The desire by some NAM attendees to 
include such language dates back to the origins of the NAM and the 
historical connection of many of its participants with national 
liberation movements.  However, this exclusionary language does not 
reflect the current world situation, and Vietnam opposes any type of 
terrorist act against civilians, Quang stressed. 
 
Democracy 
--------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Because of the NAM's consensus approach, reaching agreement 
on a definition of "democracy" in the NAM Final Document is also 
problematic, Quang continued.  NAM countries have different 
definitions, and there is no universally accepted definition. 
According to Quang, it would be "ridiculous" to include a 
country-specific reference to the transition of power in Cuba in the 
NAM Final Document. 
 
Middle East 
----------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The GVN is aware of some Arab countries' desire to include 
condemnation of Israel in the Final Document.  Because there is no 
agreement on this language, it will be set aside and, if no 
consensus language can be reached, it will be left out in its 
entirety.  The GVN will support the NAM consensus on this issue, but 
will take no initiative to include this paragraph, nor will it 
participate in side discussions to reach consensus language. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In a separate meeting on September 7, Poloff met with MFA 
West Asia and Africa Department Deputy Director Nguyen Van Linh to 
discuss Ref A's Middle East points.  Mr. Linh said Vietnam maintains 
good political and economic relations with Israel, but that there 
were many civilian victims in Lebanon due to Israel's military 
action.  The GVN position is that incidents such as the kidnapping 
of the Israeli soldiers should be resolved through peaceful 
negotiations (Ref D).  He also mentioned the NAM's consensus 
approach and said he would report our points to senior officials.
