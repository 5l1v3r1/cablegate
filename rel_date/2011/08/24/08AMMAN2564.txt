SUBJECT: UNHCR Jordan: No Plans for Large-Scale Iraqi Repatriations 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: A press report that Iraqi-chartered planes would 
fly Iraqi refugees home from Jordan before the end of Ramadan is an 
exaggeration.  UNHCR-Jordan and the GOI discussed possible 
repatriation methods during a late August 2008 meeting.  However, 
neither party committed to plans for an operation in September. 
UNHCR will assist Iraqis who voluntarily return home on an 
individual basis.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Jordanian media reported September 3 that Abd-Al-Samad 
Abd-Al-Rahman, Iraqi Minister of Immigration and Displaced Persons, 
recently met with IOM and UNHCR-Jordan to discuss the chartering of 
planes to bring home Iraqi refugees (paragraph 6 below).  RefCoord 
followed up with Arafat Jamal, UNHCR JordanQs Deputy Country 
Representative.  Jamal told us that Abd-al-Rahman paid a visit to 
Jordan during the weekend of August 30-31.  During the Minister's 
visit, according to Jamal, he expressed the GOIQs strong interest in 
encouraging repatriation to Iraq.  The Minister told UNHCR that the 
security situation in Iraq warranted general repatriation, and that 
450 Iraqis had already asked the Iraqi Embassy in Amman for 
assistance in returning home. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) One of the methods of repatriation discussed in general 
terms was the use of Iraqi-charted aircraft to fly refugees to 
Baghdad, as had been done in Egypt in August (Ref a). According to 
Jamal, UNHCR told the Minister that UNHCR would assist Iraqis to 
repatriate on an individual basis based on the merits of each case. 
Jamal explained to RefCoord that those seeking return had individual 
reasons for wanting to go home, but that UNHCR had no indication 
that significant numbers of minorities and other vulnerable Iraqis 
wished to return at this time. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) UNHCR was in the process of interviewing potential Iraqi 
returnees during RefCoord's visit.  Initial findings, per Jamal, 
indicated that while hundreds of Iraqis had approached the Iraqi 
Embassy and UNHCR for information about possible repatriation, few 
had plans to return home in the near future.  Jamal stressed that 
UNHCR would continue to follow a policy of evaluating the merit of 
any application for assisted repatriation to Iraq.  Note: Iraqis 
wishing to return spontaneously without UNHCR support can do so at 
any time.  End note. 
 
¶6. (U) The following is the text of a Jordanian report of the 
Minister's visit. 
 
Amman Al-Ghadd in Arabic 02 Sep 08 p 3A [Report by Mu'ayyad 
Abu-Subayh: "Private airplanes to transport Iraqis in the kingdom 
home"] 
 
An informed Iraqi source announced that his country's government 
plans to charter private airplanes to facilitate the return of Iraqi 
refugees in the kingdom [Jordan] back to their country following the 
noticeable improvement in the security situation in Baghdad. 
 
The source told Al-Ghadd yesterday that "Abd-al-Samad Abd-al-Rahman, 
Iraqi minister of immigration and displaced persons, recently met 
with officials from the International Immigration Organization and 
the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  They discussed 
the means for chartering private airplanes or transportation 
vehicles at the Iraqi Government's expense to facilitate the return" 
of refugees in the kingdom to their country. 
 
He added: "It is expected that the first group will leave during the 
second half of the holy month of Ramadan after all the travel 
preparations have been completed."  End quote.
