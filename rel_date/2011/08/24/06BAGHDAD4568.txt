SUBJECT:  Visit to Iranian Refugee Settlement in Iraqi Kurdistan 
 
 
This is a Kurdistan Regional Reconstruction Team cable. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) RRT Officer and U.S. Civil Affairs Team Leader, 25th 
Infantry Division, visited Barika Refugee Open Settlement for 
Iranian Kurdish refugees in Sulaimaniyah Province in the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq on December 6.  By way of background, the settlement 
is home to approximately 277 Iranian Kurdish families, most of whom 
arrived from Al-Tash Refugee Camp in the Anbar Province of western 
Iraq in 2005.  The settlement is administered by Qandil, a Swedish 
company funded by SIDA, the Swedish government's aid organization, 
which entered into a cooperative partnership with the United 
Nations.

OBSERVATIONS DURING VISIT TO REFUGEE SETTLEMENT 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) RRT officer and CA Team Leader found the following during 
their visit to Barika Refugee Settlement. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) A seven-member council elected by the refugees themselves 
oversees the daily management of the settlement.  The living 
conditions at the settlement are comparable to those of the Iraqi 
Kurdish residents living an adjacent village on top of a hill named 
Barika, but the refugees want greater access to local services. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The refugees live in 250 cement-block homes of three to 
five rooms with electricity, sewage, and water facilities.  An 
additional 100 homes are under construction.  They share their water 
supply with the adjacent Iraqi Kurdish village.  The settlement 
residents have adequate water but must purchase water at times. 
There is a medical clinic on the site, but it has limited hours so 
people must travel to the hospital in Arbat town, about five 
kilometers away, in case of an emergency.  The refugees maintain 
they need a larger school in the area to avoid double shifts for 
classes, but this is a common problem in the Kurdish region.  The 
settlement relies on police protection from Arbat. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The desire of the refugees in the settlement to assimilate 
is unclear.  It appears they want third-country resettlement, but 
this is not an option because they enjoy freedom from persecution in 
Sulaimaniyah.  The refugees in the settlement contend they can not 
hold government jobs or obtain an Iraqi driver's license.

REMARKS BY UNHCR DIRECTOR IN ERBIL 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) On December 11 The UNHCR Director for the Kurdistan Region 
told RRT Officer that negotiations are underway with the local 
authorities in Sulaimaniyah to arrange for the refugees to obtain to 
obtain driver's licenses, purchase real estate, and hold fixed 
contract jobs in both the public and private sectors if they hold a 
UNHCR ration card.  According to the director, Iranian Kurdish 
refugees in Erbil Province already have these rights. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT:  Iran opposed the resettlement of refugees from 
Anbar to Sulaimaniyah province, claiming they were engaged in 
hostile political activity.  Sulaimaniyah authorities may well be 
under pressure from Iran to limit refugee support and integration, 
but the UNHCR believes that it will be successful in obtaining the 
same rights for the refugees in Sulaiymaniyah as in Erbil.
