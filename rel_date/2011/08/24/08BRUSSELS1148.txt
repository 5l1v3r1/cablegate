Â¶1. (SBU)  MFA Middle East Office Director Francoise Gustin 
told POLOFF that GOB agrees with the points presented in 
reftel.  The Belgians believe Solana should be the only one 
to have direct contact with the SARG.  Belgium is in favor of 
keeping open the dialog with Syria, but thinks the EU must 
have a common position and Belgium will work within it, via 
Solana.  Belgium has an Embassy in Damascus but is keeping 
its bilateral relations with the SARG low key.
