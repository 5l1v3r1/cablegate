LOTFA, BORDER POLICE PROJECTS 
 
REF: BERLIN 460 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Senior German Police Advisor 
Ambassador Frick told USG representatives that Doha 
II is conceived as a donors, conference with 
emphasis on the Afghan Border Police and shortfalls 
in the Law and Order Trust Fund Afghanistan (LOTFA), 
but not customs issues.  He said it will be a good 
opportunity for regional cooperation, and Germany 
expects high-level participation from neighboring 
countries.  Ambassador Frick noted that German 
project design efforts for the border areas 
generally exclude the Afghanistan-Pakistan border 
due to restrictions to the mandate of the German 
police program; Ambassador Neumann replied that the 
U.S. is very much focusing its efforts on the south 
and southwest and will be prepared to discuss 
projects in those areas.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) CFC-A hosted a meeting on Doha II on 
February 16 attended by Ambassador Neumann, DCM 
Norland and Embassy staff, LTG Eikenberry, MG 
Durbin, and CFC/OSC staff, and Ambassador Frick and 
two German senior staff members.  Ambassador Frick 
noted that the Conference, which will focus on 
support for the Afghan Border Police, is a good 
opportunity for regional cooperation.  Germany 
expects its Minister of Interior to attend and that 
all the regional states will be represented at a 
very high level, including Ministers or Deputy 
Ministers.  Preparations are underway for agreements 
to be signed during the Conference between 
Afghanistan and Tajikistan and Afghanistan and 
Uzbekistan on border cooperation. 
 
USD 300 million requested in project funding 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Amb Frick said that Doha II is primarily a 
pledging conference and Germany hopes that 
participating nations will step up to the plate to 
donate up to USD 300 million.  Germany hopes some of 
the general pledges made in London can be directed 
to this end.  The project organizers have identified 
about 40 projects in border areas in the north and 
west totaling USD 207 million dollars.  OSC-A will 
also present projects in Coalition areas that are 
available for donor support.  Amb Frick added that 
while the emphasis is on border police, some 
projects also target other police institutions, such 
as the highway police and CID, that operate in the 
border areas.  The projects also allow for support 
of border management/customs initiatives.  While 
Germany will accept side-bar presentations on 
customs- related activities (part of the US Embassy- 
led Border Management Initiative), no customs 
projects perse are to be presented at the conference 
to prevent distraction from the police sector 
efforts ) particularly critical funding for LOTFA 
that is the keystone of police reform (see below). 
(Comment:  We accept this logic; we cannot have two 
"first priorities."  The salary reform piece is 
central to all aspects of police reform, including 
border police.  End comment.) 
 
USD 40 million in LOTFA shortfall 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Regarding LOTFA, Amb Frick emphasized that 
 
KABUL 00000749  002 OF 002 
 
 
due to substantial increases in police salaries as 
part of the nationwide police reform, the amount of 
money needed for LOTFA will increase from the 
present amount of USD 80 million/year  to USD 120 
million.  The additional USD 40 million will need to 
be met yearly at least through 2008/09.  He noted 
that LOTFA is now primarily funded by the U.S. and 
EU, with smaller contributions from other sources, 
and said he hopes that both the U.S. and EU will 
increase their contributions proportionally to meet 
the new requirements (note: the U.S. contributed 
USD 40 million to LOTFA in FY 2005.  EU 
contributions come out of central funding, not by 
nation.) 
 
German Limitations in Border Project Areas 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) Ambassador Frick noted that the projects 
proposed by Germany at the Doha conference will 
concentrate on the north and west but not the border 
with Pakistan.  Although police reform is conceived 
to be nation-wide, the German mandate is limited to 
assisting border areas which have been &pacified.8 
This is taken as excluding the Afghanistan-Pakistan 
border (except the Torkham border crossing, where 
some work is being done).  Germany sees this as a 
civilian mission and the border areas with Pakistan 
as a "security" issue outside the German mandate. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Ambassador Neumann replied that the U.S. 
has a different definition of what the Afghan border 
police needs, and that we do not see the south as a 
military-only situation.  He noted that we are 
getting frantic appeals from the GOA to assist the 
police in the southern border region.  He suggested 
that Germany would be well advised to tailor its 
presentation at Doha in such as way as to make clear 
that there remains a division of responsibility 
regarding police in the border areas, and that the 
U.S. will present its view of what can be done in 
the south and southeast.  Neumann suggested that if 
the U.S. had sufficient time in the agenda, we could 
note the projects in the south and east without 
having this appear as a U.S.-German disagreement. 
Ambassador Frick agreed to work on this idea with 
OSC-A. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU)  We understand that for its internal 
political reasons the Germans have a particular 
restriction on working in tough areas.  This need 
not be a problem.  There is enough work for all of 
us.  But Germany must not confus its internal issues 
with the need to use police to keep citizens safe in 
the midst of an insurgency.
