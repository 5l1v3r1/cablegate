REF: STATE 15808 
 
(SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche on support for a 
12-month Minustah mandate to Spanish MFA Subdirector General 
for the United Nations Manuel Gonzalez de Linares Palou and 
Haiti Desk officer Jaume Segura.  Linares told Poloff 
February 9 that Spain was completely on board in support of 
lengthening the mandate, but that he needed to contact 
Subdirector for Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean 
Carmen Diez Orejas, who was traveling until February 12, and 
Carlos Morales, the Subdirector General for Continental Asia, 
to calibrate their approach.  On February 13, Segura called 
Poloff to inform that Spain had approached the Chinese 
February 12, receiving a noncommittal response.  Segura 
expressed hope that the Contact Group's unity on the matter 
would bring success in the UNSC vote.
