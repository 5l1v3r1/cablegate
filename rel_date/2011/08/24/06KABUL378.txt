SUBJECT: PRT/HELMAND  PROVINCIAL COUNCIL MOVING FORWARD 
 
1.(SBU)SUMMARY: The Helmand Provincial Council (PC) has 
been active since getting organized in late November.  PC 
PC 
members have participated in a number of public events in 
Lashkar Gah (the provincial capital) and outlying 
districts.  It is also meeting weekly with Helmands new 
governor to discuss pertinent issues.  The governor and the 
PC appear willing to cooperate to improve governance.  The 
PC has an office in the governors compound where it has 
met with many citizens to hear their concerns (primarily 
security and government corruption).  The PC would like to 
be an active participant with the PRT in delivering 
humanitarian and/or reconstruction assistance.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Â¶2. (SBU)GETTING KNOWN: PRT POLOFF and the incoming UK PRT 
Commander met with the PCs Deputy Chairman, Haji Qurban 
Ali Urozgani, to discuss PC activities since mid-December. 
During that timeframe, members of the PC have engaged in a 
number of trips and activities to become better known. 
Several members traveled to Baghni, in the far north of 
Helmand.  Another group went to Naw Zad.  Both these trips 
rips 
involved PRT-related activities in districts that have had 
their share of security incidents. 
 
3.(SBU)In addition to the trips, the PC has been engaged 
in a number of key provincial meetings and activities in 
and around Lashkar Gah.  These include: (1) meeting 
parliamentarians; (2) conducting interviews on a local 
radio station; (3) discussing poppy eradication with Poppy 
Elimination Program (PEP) team members; (4) meeting the 
DIAG committee on approaches for encouraging disarmament; 
and (5) establishing a weekly dialogue with Governor Daoud. 
In addition, PC members participated in other PRT 
activities, including the handover of supplies for the 
agricultural school and the groundbreaking for a new 
madrassa (religious school). 
 
4.(SBU)GOOD START WITH THE GOVERNOR: Urozgani said that 
the PC has developed a positive relationship with Helmands 
new governor, Engineer Daoud.  The PC and the governor meet 
weekly; more often if necessary.  Separately, Governor 
rnor 
Daoud said that he fully supported the PC.  He asked the PC 
to look at provincial government departments and suggest 
changes.  The governor said that he has asked for PC input 
in developing a list of good candidates for provincial 
government offices. 
 
5.(SBU)WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING: Perhaps not surprisingly, 
Urozgani said that many citizens whom the PC meets are 
expressing concern about security and government 
corruption.  Many people generally support the government, 
he added, but are disappointed with its lack of 
responsiveness to their problems.  They are expressing 
frustration with the need to pay bribes to get anything 
done. 
 
6.(SBU)PC CONCERNED ABOUT OPIUM: The PC is also 
concerned about the opium issue.  Urozgani said that, while 
he was not speaking for the PC, he discussed opium 
eradication with PEP team members.  He told them that the 
situation is very complex.  The fact that ACM elements 
are coercing poor farmers into cultivating poppy further 
rther 
complicates the problem.  Urozgani said that he supports 
poppy eradication, but on a step by step basis, to avoid 
impoverishing the poor farmers.  He suggested that an 
effective method would be to start by eradicating poppy on 
land owned by government and elected officials.  Another 
step would be to eradicate poppy on land currently occupied 
illegally.  This would add credibility to the governments 
eradication efforts.  Acknowledging that the provincial 
police are corrupt, Urozgani suggested an elite, non- 
corrupted law enforcement entity responsible for 
eradication.  (Note: Eradication in Helmand has often 
turned into a police extortion campaign against small 
farmers, who are compelled to pay bribes to avoid 
eradication and/or jailing.  End Note). 
7.(SBU)KEEP US IN MIND: Urozgani said that the PC would 
like to continue its cooperative relationship with the PRT. 
To that end, he suggested that the PRT find ways to include 
the PC in humanitarian or reconstruction projects.  He said 
e said 
that this will enhance the PCs credibility. 
 
8.(SBU)COMMENT: Considering the vagueness of the PCs 
role and responsibilities, it is off to a positive start. 
As its members become more visible at public events and 
meet more citizens, the PC is likely to gain additional 
credibility.  Over the long run, maintaining this 
credibility will depend on citizens perceptions that the 
PC can serve as a conduit for addressing their concerns. 
END COMMENT.
