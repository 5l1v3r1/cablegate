¶1. (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Iran Desk Officer Yuliya 
Yushchenko told Emboff on July 2 that while Ukraine is 
concerned about events surrounding the election in Iran, it 
has taken a position of non-interference.  Ukraine has not 
issued any statements regarding the election or its 
aftermath. 
¶2. (SBU)  Yushchenko said that Ukraine is aware that some EU 
countries have considered pulling their diplomats out of Iran 
in response to the detention of British Embassy local staff. 
Ukraine is unlikely to follow suit, but Yushchenko did not 
rule this out completely.  Yushchenko explained that Ukraine 
has five diplomats in Iran and that there are approximately 
10 Iranian diplomats in Ukraine.   Bilateral relations focus 
mostly on trade, with approximately one thousand Ukrainians 
in Iran as skilled labor, including workers at the Bushehr 
nuclear power plant.
