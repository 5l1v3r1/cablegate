SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR RICE'S INTRODUCTORY MEETING WITH 
ZIMBABWE PR CHIDYAUSIKU 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a March 5 introductory meeting, Zimbabwe 
PermRep Chidyausiku told Ambassador Rice Zimbabwe wants to 
engage with the U.S.  He noted the dramatic decline in 
health, education, infrastructure and quality of life in 
Zimbabwe and asked for the U.S. to lift its sanctions. 
Chidyausiku expressed appreciation for the U.S. and 
international humanitarian assistance and asked for the U.S. 
to have a little faith in Zimbabwe. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador Rice replied that the U.S. has great 
faith in the Zimbabwean people, but needs tangible political 
results for the U.S. to increase its confidence in the 
Zimbabwean government.  She said Zimbabwe would have to show 
a true commitment to powersharing and democracy in order to 
overcome U.S. skepticism.  She said Zimbabwe should:  appoint 
a legitimate Attorney General who supported rule of law; 
appoint a credible central banker; release political 
prisoners; enact true security sector reform; and enact a 
sustainable economic and land reform plan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Chidyausiku said he thought that President Mugabe 
would likely retire following the ZANU-PF party conference 
scheduled for the end of the year, and that a new party 
leader may emerge from that meeting.  He said Mugabe, now 85, 
was ready to retire in 2000, but the animosity between 
Zimbabwe and the UK at that time motivated him to continue. 
Mugabe was now a hero, Chidyausiku said, because of the 
ongoing attacks on him by the international community. 
Chidyausiku also stressed new elections would be held within 
18 to 24 months, after the required new constitution is 
ratified, which he believed would be a positive end to the 
transition government.  Ambassador Rice kept the door open to 
engagement, but reiterated the new government needed to show 
credible improvement for the U.S. to change its current 
policies.
