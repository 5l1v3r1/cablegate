REF: KHARTOUM 2469 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Military confrontations along the Chad-Sudan 
border continue, as reports and troop movements indicate that the 
Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) may imminently launch a counterattack 
against Justice and Equality (JEM)/National Redemption Front (NRF) 
rebels near Tina.  The SAF suffered a defeat there on October 7 and 
have already retaliated by bombing the village of Hamara, in Chad, 
on October 10.

SAF Responds to Defeat on Border

¶2.  (SBU) On October 7, either JEM or JEM-led NRF elements under the 
authority of Abdallah Banda attacked SAF positions near Tina 
(reftel).  The SAF claims the vehicles used in the attack bore 
Chadian registration numbers.  AMIS confirms that the SAF responded 
by carrying out Antonov bombing raids targeting the village of 
Hamara, Chad.  The UN and AMIS also report continued SAF aerial 
reconnaissance in the vicinity of Tina and the local SAF commander 
requested that AMIS inform him of the peacekeepers' movements in 
order to avoid inadvertent targeting by SAF attack helicopter or 
Antonov bombers. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Reporting from both the UN and AMIS also suggests that 
rebels may be preparing to attack SAF and AMIS forces positioned 
near the town.  AMIS reinforced its military group site at Tina with 
one platoon on October 9 as a precaution.

SAF Continues to Bring Forces to Tina

¶4.  (SBU) Government troops continue to reposition and reinforce in 
the vicinity of Tina.  UN contacts noted to Active Response Corps 
(ARC) Officer that 17 SAF vehicles moved from Girgira to Tina on 
October 11, while roughly 150 vehicles controlled by Chadian 
opposition groups remained in position between the villages of Sirba 
and Silea, with the likelihood the convoy would move to Tina in 
support of SAF.  Additional reports indicate that Chadian opposition 
groups received up to 200 barrels of fuel from the GoS.
