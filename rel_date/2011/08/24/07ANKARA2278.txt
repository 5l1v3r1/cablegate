REF: STATE 118167 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We met with ASELSAN Purchasing Manager Mehmet Ali 
Akcoray on September 5 to discuss reftel Blue Lantern case. 
Akcoray confirmed that ASELSAN received the shipment of two 
quartz dual axis rate sensors on September 21, 2006, and 
stated that the reftel items are periodically being used in 
research and development of components that are being 
designed for an indigenous tank program.  Noting that the 
parts are currently stored at the on-site warehouse, Akcoray 
offered to escort us to the warehouse for a physical 
inspection of reftel items.  He reassured us that the items 
will not be re-exported or re-transferred. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Based on the meeting with Akcoray, the documentary 
evidence he provided, and ASELSAN's reputation as a major 
military technology research and manufacturing company with 
strong ties to the Turkish military, ASELSAN appears to be 
using the reftel items properly.
