SUBJECT: Bayu Meeting, H1N1, Halal and TIFA 
 
On October 2, 2009 Post met with Dr. Bayu Krisnamurthi, Deputy 
Minister for Agriculture and Marine, Indonesian Coordinating 
Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA).  U.S. representatives raised 
several agricultural trade issues with Dr. Krisnamurthi, including 
the Government of Indonesia's (GOI) ban on U.S. fresh and frozen 
pork and pork products, halal certification, and the Ministry of 
Agriculture's involvement in the United States - Indonesia Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA). 
U.S. Fresh and Frozen Pork and Pork Products Ban 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Indonesia banned U.S. fresh and frozen pork and pork 
products, effective April 27, 2009 following the detection of H1N1 
in the United States.  According to Dr. Krisnamurthi, it is unlikely 
the pork ban will be repealed by the current Indonesian Minister of 
Agriculture.   Post expects a new Minister of Agriculture to be 
named after the Indonesian Presidential Inauguration on October 20, 
¶2009.  Dr. Krisnamurthi also asked for a progressive list of the 
countries that have lifted the ban in recent months. 
 
HALAL 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Recently the Indonesian Council of Ulama (MUI) prepared to 
publish a final list of U.S. Islamic organizations recognized as 
eligible to provide halal certification for animal and products 
derived from animals for export to Indonesia.  This halal certifier 
eligibility list was due to be published and subsequently 
implemented on October 1, 2009.  According to Dr. Krisnamurthi, a 
decision was made within the GOI to delay implementing the October 1 
halal certifier eligibility list for 3 months. Post officials asked 
if there was any written or formal announcement declaring the delay 
of implementation.  Dr. Krisnamurthi recommended that U.S. Embassy 
officials contact the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) for official 
information on slaughter animals and the National Agency for Drug 
and Food Control for official information on processed foods and 
flavorings. 
 
NOTE:  On October 7, Post received draft copy of an Indonesian 
Council of Ulama (MUI) circular that stated that the new halal 
certifier eligibility list will be published and subsequently 
implemented on October 15, 2009, contradicting Dr. Krisnamurthi's 
information. 
 
TIFA 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post representatives expressed their concern that the MoA 
has been noticeably absent from recent United States - Indonesia 
TIFA discussions.  Dr. Krisnamurthi asked for a list of the 
agriculture related issues to be discussed during the next TIFA and 
implied that an internal GOI discussion will take place regarding 
MoA's attendance at the next round of TIFA talks. 
 
As the Deputy Minister for CMEA, Dr. Krisnamurthi has influence over 
the Ministries of Trade and Agriculture.  By addressing these issues 
with Dr. Krisnamurthi, Post expects he will bring greater attention 
to U.S. concerns within the GOI.  Prioritizing these issues would 
demonstrate commitment to advancing our bilateral economic and trade 
agenda.  This meeting also reflects Post's desire to for broader 
outreach and interest in cultivating relationships with key policy 
makers, particularly in advance of the new Yudhoyono Administration.
