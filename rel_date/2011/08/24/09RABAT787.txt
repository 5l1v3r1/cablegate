MENA-OECD Ministerial 
--------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) initiative 
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) will hold its 2009 Ministerial Conference entitled 
"Beyond the Crisis: Business and Citizens at the Center of 
Policy Responses" in Marrakesh on November 23.  The 
Conference will bring together Ministers charged with 
investment and public governance policies to exchange 
solutions for the ongoing economic crisis.  The outcome of 
the gathering, highlighted Minister Baraka at a September 16 
Ambassadorial briefing, will be the "Marrakesh Declaration." 
This Declaration, he continued, will show the strong 
commitment of MENA and OECD countries to pursuing priority 
public governance and business climate reforms to mitigate 
the negative effects of the crisis on growth, employment and 
public services.  The Ministerial will be the first time 
ministers of investment policy and public governance affairs 
will meet to provide strategic responses to the current 
economic global context, noted OECD Chief of Public Sector 
Management Martin Forst at the briefing. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The program will be presided by Prime Minister 
Abbas El Fassi who will accept handover of the MENA-OECD 
initiative chairmanship from Egypt to Morocco.  The Secretary 
General of OECD Angel Gurria, Egyptian Minister of Investment 
Dr. Mahmoud Mohieldin, the Spanish Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Miguel Angel Moratinos and UNDP Administrator Helen 
Clark are all scheduled to take part in the event.  Topics 
will include "responses beyond the crisis," "regional reform 
achievements," and the adoption of the Ministerial 
"Marrakesh" Declaration.  Working group meetings in 
preparation for the Ministerial are planned for the end of 
September and early October in Egypt and France on investment 
policy and promotion and entrepreneurship and human capital 
development. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Two separate forums are scheduled for November 22 
in addition to the Ministerial Conference. The MENA-OECD 
Business Forum and Women Business Leaders Summit will be an 
opportunity for business representatives and entrepreneurs to 
develop action-oriented strategies to face the economic 
future of the MENA region with a strong reform agenda in 
place, said OECD Chief of Private Sector Development 
Alexander Bohmer.  Participants will be able to debate issues 
of critical importance to the region, Bohmer added, such as 
tapping the potential of women's entrepreneurship and 
fostering responsible business conduct.  Alongside the 
Business Forum on November 22 will be a Governance Forum, 
which will promote debate on the governance pre-conditions 
for economic recovery and sustainable growth, taking into 
consideration the needs of citizens, the demands of society, 
and environmental challenges.
