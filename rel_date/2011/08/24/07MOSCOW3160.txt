¶1. (U) SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT FOR INTERNET 
DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶2. (U) We delivered reftel talking points to MFA Russia-US 
Bilateral Relations Head Alexander Zakharov on June 27. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Zakharov expressed his understanding that taxes make 
up the largest part of gasoline prices (a point we refuted), 
and suggested that consumers should perhaps be more angry at 
their own governments than at OPEC or producers.  However, he 
appreciated the importance of the actions and words of 
producers in contributing to political backlash in consumer 
countries.  He said the MFA would "write up a report" and 
pass the message on to relevant colleagues. 
 
¶4. (U) We plan to deliver the demarche to the Ministry of 
Industry as well, and will report any additional comments 
septel.
