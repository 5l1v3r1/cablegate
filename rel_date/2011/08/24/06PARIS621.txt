SUBJECT:  UNESCO: UNESCO-SENIOR LEVEL POSITIONS AND 
HIRING OF AMCITS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Progress has been slow hiring Americans at 
UNESCO.  We do not miss an opportunity to push for more 
American staff but we run up against a tight budget 
situation, a clamor from the staff union to compete 
more positions internally so that long-time employees 
can get promoted and UNESCO's need to find positions 
for participants in the Young Professionals Program. 
At the same time, there will be a significant number of 
retirements in the next five years that should create 
many more opportunities. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The one Amcit Assistant Director General, is 
Peter Smith, the head of UNESCO's Education Sector. 
Smith's position is of crucial importance to the USG as 
this is the area of greatest US interest at UNESCO. 
Smith took up his position in June 2005 and is expected 
to remain in that position for several years. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Applications for the ADG for Culture closed 
in December.  The job is currently encumbered by an 
Algerian.  There is no likelihood, this position could 
be filled by an American. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Deputy ADG for Culture position is now 
vacant and will not likely be advertised until the new 
ADG is in place.  An Amcit candidacy would be 
considered for this position. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The contract of the ADG for Science was 
recently extended for only one year.  If the incumbent 
is not extended, this is a position that could be 
encumbered by an Amcit. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The contract of the ADG for Social and Human 
Sciences has also been renewed for only one year but 
the future of this sector is in doubt, pending a review 
of both the Natural and Social Science Sectors.  If the 
job is kept and advertised, it is doubtful that an 
Amcit would be hired for the position. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) P5 Natural Sciences.  This job is also 
crucial to US interests and once it is announced, 
serious effort should be made to find a qualified 
Amcit. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) P5 Division for Freedom of Expression, 
Democracy and Peace in the Communications and 
Information Sector.  This job is currently being 
competed internally.  Given USG interest in democracy 
building, we have made a strong pitch to have this job 
opened to external competition. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) D1 Director of the Division of Human Rights. 
We have been pushing for an Amcit to be chosen for this 
position, which is currently vacant. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) D1 Director of Internal Oversight.  The 
incumbent, a UK national, may be leaving.  Again, given 
the USG's emphasis on good UN management, this would be 
a good job for an Amcit. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Director of UNESCO Brasilia Office.  There 
is a strong American candidate that we are aware of for 
this job.  We believe an American in this position 
would be desirable, though there is likely to be push- 
back from the DDG who is Brazilian.
