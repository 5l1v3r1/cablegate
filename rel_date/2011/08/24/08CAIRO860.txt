¶1. (SBU) The GOE seeks to re-invigorate the idea that UN and 
AU Darfur envoys Jan Elaisson and Selim Ahmed Selim engage in 
"shuttle diplomacy" between the rebel groups and GOS to bring 
them to a comprehensive political solution, MFA Cabinet 
Advisor for African Affairs Ahmed Abu Zeid told us on April 
¶24.  The GOE prefers that the envoys discuss not just the 
logistics of bringing the parties together to negotiate, but 
also the substantive political issues of concern.  The GOE 
believes that shuttling between the parties on key political 
issues is the best way to bring them to a political solution 
given the fractious nature of the rebel groups, he said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) As a second-best option, Abu Zeid said that the GOE 
supports the envoys' reportedly current initiative to bring 
the rebels and GOS together to discuss only security issues, 
to achieve a cessation of hostilities and provide a basis for 
further talks.  However, Abu Zeid noted that Justice and 
Equality Movement (JEM) leader Khalil Ibrahim, whose forces 
are most active rebel "presence on the ground," has said he 
will not meet with the GOS in the presence of other Darfur 
rebel leaders, and that Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army 
(SLM/A) leader Abdulwahid Nur is also on the fence.  He 
warned that without these two important rebel factions, and 
particularly the JEM, any mediation efforts are 
"meaningless."  He also warned that the talks should include 
not just the rebels and the GOS but also important 
neighboring countries, given the deep involvement in the 
conflict particularly on the part of Chad.
