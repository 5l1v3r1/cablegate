SUBJECT: MFA JOINS CALL FOR EMERGENCY UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
MEETING 
 
REF: ALGIERS 1305 
 
¶1.  In conjunction with the meeting of the Arab League 
foreign ministers in Cairo, MFA issued a statement July 15 
calling on the UN Security Council to "hold an emergency 
meeting to put an end to the criminal Israeli aggressions" 
and "assure the protection of the Lebanese and Palestinian 
peoples."  In the statement, which apart from the call for an 
urgent UNSC meeting largely tracked with the MFA statement 
described reftel, the GOA denounced "the flagrant aggression" 
perpetrated by Israeli military forces against Palestine and 
Lebanon.  It reiterated Algeria's "great concern" about the 
situation in the region, appealed to the Quartet to "work to 
stop the daily cycle of violence carried out by Israel" and 
repeated Algeria's call on Israel "to withdraw its forces, 
lift the blockade imposed on the Palestinian people and the 
whole of Lebanese territory, and free Arab and Palestinian 
prisoners detained in Israeli prisons." 
 
¶2.  The statement called for Arab unity against "Israeli 
aggression" and said Israeli military operations served to 
"exacerbate the situation, accentuate the suffering, and 
complicate matters in this sensitive region of the world, all 
of which could result in deplorable consequences."  The 
statement concluded by stating that Algeria "would spare no 
effort to support initiatives in favor of stopping aggression 
and occupation and establishing peace and security in this 
vital region of the world."
