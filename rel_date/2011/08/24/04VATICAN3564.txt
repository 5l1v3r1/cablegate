SUBJECT: CARITAS OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE IN IRAQ DESPITE 
RISING THREATS TO PERSONNEL 
 
 
1.Caritas, the humanitarian aid agency of the Catholic 
Church, will continue operations to support Iraqi 
reconstruction despite a recent increase in the threat 
level to its personnel.  In a statement issued September 
10, responding in part to the abduction of two Italian aid 
workers in Baghdad, Caritas said that its Iraq office works 
primarily with children and young mothers, administering 14 
centers in the Baghdad, Mosul, Karakoush, Kirkuk and Bassra 
regions.  Two of these are jointly administered with the 
Red Crescent. 
 
2.More than 100 local nutrition, engineering and 
technical experts, along with local volunteers have to date 
e 
assisted some 24,000 children and 10,000 mothers and 
pregnant women with two million euros of overseas aid. 
Part of this figure has been spent on supplying hospitals 
in Baghdad and Mosul, as well as seven clinics.  Other 
Caritas projects include feeding programs for at-risk 
groups -- the homeless, elderly, disabled, orphans and 
widows without family support.  Food aid is being 
supplemented by projects to restore clean water.  Planned 
reconstruction work for homes destroyed in fighting is on 
hold at present because of the security situation. 
 
3.Comment:  Caritas' international federation will 
continue to provide partnership funding for Caritas Iraq's 
activities in Iraq.  Using local personnel, Caritas lowers 
the risk of attack or abduction for its staff.  Caritas has 
publicly condemned terrorist acts that target aid workers. 
End comment.
