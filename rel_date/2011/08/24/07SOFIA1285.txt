(SBU)  On October 31 Polecoff delivered reftel demarche to 
Bulgarian MFA's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), 
European Correspondent Unit officer Valetin Guydarov. 
According to Mr. Guydarov, the GOB as an EU member state 
supported the EU's statement and position which condemned the 
PKK's attacks against Turkish territory.  Mr. Guydarov stated 
that the GOB strongly condemns the PKK's use of violence and 
recognizes the Government of Turkey's right to protect its 
citizens and itself from terrorists.  He noted that this 
right should respect international law and not be 
disproportionate to the attack itself.  According to Mr. 
Guydarov, the GOB believes the Governments of Turkey and Iraq 
and the Kurdish Regional Government should cooperate to 
protect people in this region from similar attacks while 
ensuring respect for the Turkish border.  Mr. Guydarov opined 
that the GOB hopes that the topic of PKK violence/terrorism 
will be on the agenda for the next EU Foreign Ministers 
General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) 
meeting. 
 
(SBU) On October 30 Polecoff delivered reftel demarche to 
Plamen Petkov, Head of the USA Branch of the MFA America 
Directorate.  Petkov said that he agreed with the demarche 
points and would pass the demarche along to the appropriate 
department.
