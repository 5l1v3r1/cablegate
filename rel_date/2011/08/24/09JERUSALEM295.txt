Main Stories: 
------------- 
All papers lead with hardening Israeli-Hamas stands on linking 
the Gaza truce to a prisoner exchange.  The papers quote Israeli 
li 
Premier Olmert repeating, in Jerusalem on February 17 that the 
release of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in Gaza will be 
linked to a truce and the opening of Gaza crossings.  The papers 
further report that the Israeli government is scheduled to make a 
decision on truce and prisoners issues on February 18.  Al Ayyam's 
front page cites AFP in reporting that Hamas Chief Khalid Misha'al 
rejected the linkage and accused Israel of hindering Egyptian 
efforts for a truce in Gaza.  Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page cites 
the AFP in quoting French Foreign Ministry spokesman Eric Chevalier 
stating that France hopes that efforts on the truce and prisoner 
exchange will be made in parallel. 
In other Gaza-related coverage, the three papers cite Wafa in a 
front page report on a Palestinian Authority(PA) plan for Gaza's 
early recovery and reconstruction in partnership with the 
international community.  The two-year plan that was accepted by the 
PA cabinet on February 17, will be submitted to the Gaza 
reconstruction conference in Cairo on March 2.  Al Hayat Al Jadida's 
front page quotes PA Cabinet Secretary General Sadi Krunz predicting 
that the PA will face a difficult financial crisis if donors' funds 
are not soon received. 
Al Ayyam's front page cites Reuters in quoting Russian Foreign 
Minister Lavrov stating in Cairo on February 17 that Russia will 
continue dialogue with Hamas in support of Palestinian 
reconciliation, and that he discussed with his Egyptian counterpart 
the goal of realizing a long term truce in Gaza. 
Al Ayyam's front page, and inside Al Quds, runs an AFP story on 
President Obama's agreement to send 12,000 additional troops to 
Afghanistan by next summer.  The papers note that Obama believes 
that the expected troop withdrawal from Iraq will allow him more 
flexibility in deploying additional troops in Afghanistan. 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida's front pages cite news agencies in 
reporting that the Israeli Likud party is unyielding in its demand 
for premiership in Israel and rejects sharing the position with the 
Kadima party.  The papers further report that Israeli President 
Peres will start talks today with the Israeli parties on forming a 
new government in Israel. Al Hayat Al Jadida notes that the Israel 
Beiteinu leader Lieberman "is dancing in two parties" in reference 
to pledging his support for the two major parties Likud and Kadima. 
All the papers run a front page article citing British Daily 
Telegraph reporting that Israel is engaged in a secret war in Iran 
to sabotage its nuclear program.  The paper quotes an unidentified 
Pentagon official revealing that Israel is targeting staff members 
of Iran's nuclear program. 
Al Hayat Al Jadida and Al Ayyam's front pages cite Reuters in 
quoting a UN spokesman revealing that unexploded Israeli munitions 
from the recent Gaza conflict, are missing.  The report adds that 
the munitions were collected by international experts after the war 
ended, and that Israel believes that Hamas has taken them. 
Al Quds' inside report cites a UNICEF report on statistics about the 
"Gaza war" revealing the displacement of 90,000 Palestinians, the 
killing of 1,440 Palestinians and injury of 5,380 others, in 
addition to the destruction of 14,000 Palestinian houses.  The paper 
runs another inside report on UNRWA's appeal to raise $345 million 
for the organization to continue serving Gaza refugees. The report 
adds that the EU has provided $41 million in additional assistance 
to the Palestinians through UNRWA to support Gaza Palestinians.

1) Azmi Khawaja, a member of the Palestinian National Council, 
opines in Al Ayyam under the title, "Obama - a turning point in 
American policy?"(02/18):  "Obama is a turning point in the American 
policy and all the steps that he has taken so far are indicators of 
good things to come.  He is actually a hope for all peoples, 
especially Asian peoples.  He calls for providing opportunities to 
all people to realize their dreams and aspirations, and to work for 
preparing a future of peace for the coming generations.  [For] all 
the aforementioned [reasons], we find Israel crying out for the 
George Bush Jr., because he was the best president for [promoting] 
Israeli interests and providing unlimited economic, military and 
political support.  When he left the White House, Arabs and Muslims 
breathed a sigh of relief." 
2)  Al Quds editorial is titled, "Donor countries, meeting 
commitments"(02/18):  "Donor countries, to whom the Palestinian 
people are highly thankful for their support, must provide a 
mechanism to ensure the regular transfer of assistance to the 
Palestinian Authority budget and to work on lifting Israeli 
limitations on movement and trade in order to allow the Palestinian 
economy to bloom and increase independence in Palestine.  These 
countries that are sponsoring the peace process should shoulder 
their responsibilities, especially now, as Israel continues to 
practice the same intransigent policies...  builds settlements while 
Palestinians are committed to peace initiatives even when it causes 
them to suffer in so many ways."
