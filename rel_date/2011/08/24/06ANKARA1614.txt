OF AMERICA 
 
Ankara, March 22, 2006 
 
Dear Madam Secretary of State, 
 
Thank you for your kind message wishing me a quick recovery. 
I regret that my visit, envisaged for the dates of 25-31 
March 2006 had to be cancelled due to a surgery that I had to 
undergo, which apparently will not permit me to travel by air 
for some time. 
 
If I could have realized the visit, it would have been a 
distinct pleasure for me to meet you and discuss matters of 
mutual concern. 
 
In the meantime, I am looking forward to welcoming you in 
Turkey at a mutually convenient date so that we can take up 
current issues in detail. 
 
I avail myself of this opportunity, Madame Secretary, to 
extend you my best regards. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
/s/ 
 
Abdullah Gul 
Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
the Republic of Turkey.
