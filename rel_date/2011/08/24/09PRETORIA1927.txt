¶2. (SBU) Meeting with POL and Econ Deputies on September 14, 
Department of International Relations and Cooperation Deputy 
Director for UN Security Council Issues Ilia Dubuisson made 
it clear that, notwithstanding South Africa's support for 
Kosovo's World Bank membership, Pretoria remains "in no 
hurry" to recognize Kosovo. Dubuisson said that the SAG does 
not consider Kosovo's recognition by 62 governments to be an 
overwhelming endorsement.  According to Dubuisson, South 
Africa prefers to have the International Court of Justice 
advisory opinion on Kosovo before considering recognition.
