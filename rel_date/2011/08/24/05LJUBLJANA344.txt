¶1. On 24 May, Econoff delivered reftel talking points to Jana 
Testen, Head of the International Department at the Ministry 
of Labor, Family, and Social Affairs.  After hearing reftel 
points supporting the Barbados candidacy, Testen said she had 
just received a fax advocating the candidacy of Cuba from the 
Cuban Mission to the ILO in Geneva.  She also noted the 
Ministry had not received any information from Barbados and 
appeared to find it odd that Barbados would not seek support 
for their candidacy in a similar manner as Cuba. 
 
¶2. Testen also remarked that the Slovenia Mission to the ILO 
had received very little information on this matter from the 
EU.  As such, she had little to report on what Slovenia's 
position would be.  She said it was "highly likely" that 
Slovenia would support the "common position" of the EU.
