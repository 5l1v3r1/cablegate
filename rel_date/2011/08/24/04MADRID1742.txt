¶1. We spoke with high level officials in the Ministries of 
Foreign Affairs (including the Spanish International Aid 
Agency) and Environment regarding reftel meetings.  Secretary 
General for Pollution Prevention and Climate Change Arturo 
Gonzalo Aizpiri expressed interest in sending a couple of his 
Ministry's experts to the workshop to perform an 
environmental needs assessment.  He asked us to send further 
details when they are available.  He also asked if private 
sector entities (NGOs, industry) would be welcome to 
participate.  Javier Carbajosa, chief of staff to the MFA's 
State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, also expressed interest 
in principle and looked forward to receiving additional 
details. 
 
¶2. Regarding the follow-up donors meeting, newly-installed 
Secretary General of the Spanish International Aid Agency 
 
SIPDIS 
Juan Pablo de Laiglesia was hesitant, saying his agency would 
need more time to evaluate assistance priorities for Iraq.
