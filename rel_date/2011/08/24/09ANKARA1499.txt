REF: SECSTATE 105347 
 
¶1.  (SBU) As requested REFTEL, on October 13, we contacted 
the International Affairs section of the Turkish Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) to discuss Cihan Terzi, their candidate 
for the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU).  Terzi is an incumbent 
in this position, serving as an Inspector for the JIU since 
¶2006.  MFA First Secretary Turhan Dilmac noted that Terzi has 
enjoyed a successful term and is viewed as extremely 
qualified for the position thanks to his background in 
finance.  He said Terzi's accomplishments during his first 
term include a review of the working capital fund in the 
World Meteorological Organization, a review of the national 
competitive recruitment examination, and the drafting of a 
wide swath of reports, notes, and management letters. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to a curriculum vitae provided by the 
MFA, Terzi previously served as a Financial Counselor at the 
Permanent Mission of Turkey to the United Nations 
(2002-2005); as Head of Department, General Directorate of 
Revenues for the Ministry of Finance (1997-2002); and as 
Inspector, Tax Inspection Board of the Ministry of Finance 
(1985-1997).  Dilmac emphasized that Terzi is well-respected 
by his colleagues at the UN and within the Ministry of 
Finance in Turkey.  Dilmac voiced no concerns about the 
general fitness of the candidate and provided no 
disqualifying information.  When asked, Dilmac indicated that 
the French candidate for this position, Gerard Biraud, is 
also an incumbent but that the Spanish candidate (Jose 
Ferrer) is largely unknown to him.
