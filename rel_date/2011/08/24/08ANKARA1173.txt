In Today's Papers 
 
Erdogan-Basbug Hold Surprise Meeting 
All papers report that on Tuesday, Prime Minister Erdogan met Land 
Forces Commander General Basbug.  The meeting was held on Erdogan's 
invitation.  A statement by the Prime Ministry said Erdogan and 
Basbug discussed some recent developments and the measures to be 
taken against the PKK in the following period.  Leftist-nationalist 
Cumhuriyet says the two also discussed the recent slander campaign 
against Basbug and the forthcoming High Military Council (YAS) 
meetings in August. 
 
High Court Acquits Gulen 
All news outlets report Islamic leader Fethullah Gulen has been 
acquitted of charges filed in 2000 that he conspired to turn Turkey 
into an Islamic state.  The Court of Appeals affirmed an earlier 
lower court ruling that had acquitted Gulen, paving the way for his 
return from exile in the United States.  The Court of Appeals upheld 
the decision to acquit Gulen despite objections from the prosecutor 
in the case.  Papers point out that Gulen, living in the US since 
1999, can now freely return to Turkey. 
 
Gul, Erdogan to Basel for Turkey-Germany Soccer Game 
The Turkish national soccer team's match against Germany in Basel, 
Switzerland tonight dominates front pages of all dailies.  President 
Abdullah Gul will go to Basel to watch the semi-final match of the 
Euro 2008 Soccer Championship.  Prime Minister Erdogan and German 
Chancellor Angela Merkel also are expected to attend the match. 
Despite several injured and suspended player, the Turkish team hopes 
to beat Germany to reach the finals on Saturday. 
 
Meanwhile, papers also report Armenian President Sarkisian, in 
Moscow for talks with Armenian community members, said he plans to 
invite President Abdullah Gul to Yerevan on September 6 to watch a 
soccer game between the Armenian and Turkish national teams. 
 
Germany Bans Kurdish Satellite Broadcaster Roj TV 
Milliyet, Hurriyet, Zaman, Cumhuriyet, Vatan:  Papers report that 
the German Interior Ministry has banned the Danish-based Kurdish 
broadcaster Roj TV as well as "Mesopotamia Broadcast", a 
Danish-based broadcasting company.  Mainstream Vatan reports that 
the German Interior Ministry claimed Roj TV is a mouthpiece of the 
PKK terrorist organization which supports violence against Turkey. 
Mainstream Hurriyet reports that Germany has frozen the financial 
assets of Roj TV, Mesopotamia Broadcasting and VIKO production 
company, which works on behalf of Roj TV in Germany. 
 
General Buyukanit Responds to Barzani Comments on PKK 
Liberal Radikal and leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet report Chief of 
General Staff General Buyukanit responded to a journalist question 
about Masoud Barzani's recent comment that the PKK is not a 
terrorist organization simply said "you all know what I've been 
saying.  This shows I was right.  The PKK is the bloodiest terrorist 
organization." 
 
Editorial Commentary on Iraq, Iran 
 
"Strategic Relations with Iraq" 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet (6/25): "Efforts are 
underway for Prime Minister Erdogan's trip to Baghdad. It will be 
the first official visit to Iraq by a Turkish PM since the Saddam 
regime's overthrow.  Turkey has made some direct contacts with the 
Iraqi regime, but these were mostly through visits to Ankara from 
Baghdad officials.  Despite visits by leaders of other neighboring 
countries such as Iran, Turkish leadership has preferred not to 
visit Baghdad.  Turkish diplomats have been making contact with the 
new Iraqi regime at various levels.  The Turkish PM's visit to 
Baghdad will certainly provide a new impetus in bilateral ties.  The 
main purpose of this visit is to lay a strategic groundwork for 
future Turkey-Iraq relations.  It is expected that a Strategic 
 
ANKARA 00001173  002 OF 002 
 
 
Cooperation Committee will be established which will help sustain 
relations in many fields, from diplomacy to security and energy to 
trade.  Ankara's sensitivity toward northern Iraq will certainly be 
part of the discussion.  The Prime Minister and his delegation will 
meet with politicians of Kurdish origin, including Talabani and 
Zabari.  Ankara has recently made efforts to open up to the Northern 
Iraqi administration.  Massoud Barzani's latest statement indicates 
that his views on PKK have not changed and this is the very reason 
for Turkey's disappointment with him.  However, a strategic 
cooperation between Turkey and Iraq is important and should not be 
overshadowed by negative statements such as Barzani's." 
 
"Iran" 
Yilmaz Oztuna wrote in conservative Turkiye (6/25): "Israel is 
working intensively against an Iranian threat.  Along with Israel's 
recent statement saying a strike against Iran is inevitable if Iran 
continues with its nuclear program, there are also speculations 
about Israel and Greece military cooperation against Iran. 
Meanwhile, Washington is preparing to lift the ban of F-22 sales to 
Israel.  Given the threatening statements against both Israel and 
the United States from Iranian leader Ahmedinejad, it all comes down 
to apocalyptic scenarios.  The IAEA Chairman alBaradei made an 
important assessment by saying Iran will use an atomic bomb in 
reprisal if it is attacked by the United States.  It is entirely in 
the hands of Iran to eliminate all apocalyptic scenarios.  Iran 
accepting the UN's full control over its nuclear research is an 
adequate measure to prevent these apocalyptic scenarios." 
 
A Cartoon in Hurriyet daily: 
Erdogan to Dengir Mir Mehmet Firat: "Thanks to you, we've found a 
name for the new party." 
On top of the party logo reads, 'Justice and Trauma Party'
