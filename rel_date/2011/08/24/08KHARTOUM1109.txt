¶1. (SBU) Summary:  At the urging of the Arab League, the GOS has 
backed off from grand demonstrations and alarming public statements 
regarding the recent ICC indictment, according to famed Sudanese 
human rights lawyer and MP Salih Mahmoud Osman. Osman predicts that 
the GOS intends to surrender Ahmed Haroun and Ali Kosheib if the ICC 
will lift its indictment of President Bashir. Osman was supportive 
of the U.S. position toward the court, but suggested the U.S. do 
more to show it demands justice and accountability for the crimes in 
Darfur. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) With the Sudanese press howling about the International 
Criminal Court (ICC), and Government of Sudan (GOS) leadership 
publicly opposing any cooperation with the court, Salih Mahmoud 
Osman met with Poloff at the Embassy July 20 to discuss the Sudanese 
legal climate in the wake of the ICC announcement. Recipients of 
numerous European and American awards for his human rights work in 
Sudan, Osman sees the case of Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo as very 
solid with overwhelming, concrete evidence (though he did not appear 
to have any inside information on what documents Ocampo might have 
been able to obtain to support the indictment). Osman reported that 
Arab countries are urging the regime's cooperation with the court 
and advising it to cancel demonstrations (which he noted the GOS 
always announces but fails to successfully organize). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Osman opined that Bashir's refusal to hand over Minister of 
State for Humanitarian Affairs Ahmed Haroun and janjaweed leader Ali 
Kosheib forced Ocampo's hand.  He speculated there may be advisors 
around Bashir reminding him of his initial mistake, and that Bashir 
may now be prepared to cooperate with the court. "They have to give 
an answer. They may say, 'We won't surrender Bashir but you can have 
Ahmed Haroun.'" While panicked that Haroun and Kosheib will disclose 
information damaging to the regime upon their arrests, Osman said he 
believes insiders within the National Congress Party (NCP) also 
believe that Bashir's indictment, an alternative far more 
consequential, can be suspended in light of a handover of Ocampo's 
original suspects. (Note: This information contradicts what other 
observers have said, and what the Arab League "negotiated" with the 
regime, that Haroun and Kosheib could face a tribunal in Sudan 
rather than the ICC. End note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) Osman cautions that international actors must be careful 
not to de-legitimize the claims of the Darfuri victims, whom the 
United States, in Osman's view, quite rightly categorized as victims 
of genocide in 2005. "The U.S. position is very balanced, not 
offending anyone," Osman said, "but the GOS has been using U.S. 
reservations to the ICC by interpreting it as if the U.S. is against 
the ICC, and so against justice. The U.S. remains silent, but the 
U.S. should say we are not against justice if there are crimes, but 
not necessarily through the mechanism of the ICC." Osman advised 
that if the U.S. opposes the ICC so strongly, it should push the 
creation of an ad hoc court, potentially in Sudan, to bring to 
justice those who committed the crimes in Darfur. 
 
¶5. (SBU) While the international community presses Darfuris to 
participate in next year's elections, justice for GOS crimes in 
Darfur remains Osman's chief obsession. "With the consequences of 
the situation in Darfur, there must be recognition that Darfuris are 
entitled to legal rights. The government has a right to deal with 
the rebels as a counterinsurgency, but there are rules it must 
follow." Osman noted that current Sudanese and international 
conventional wisdom appears to hold that the issuance of an arrest 
warrant will drive Sudan further towards war, but Osman disagrees, 
stating that justice is a precondition for peace. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: Osman may be right that the regime will ultimately 
be forced to give up Haroun and Kosheib, and we know that elements 
within the senior ranks of the NCP did consider turning them over to 
the ICC as an option to avoid an indictment of Bashir, but at this 
point it seems the GOS is headed in the direction of trying Haroun 
and Kosheib in Sudanese courts.  It is noteworthy that Osman himself 
did not urge the US to push for the regime to turn Haroun and 
Kosheib over to the ICC, but rather advocated for trying them in 
local courts since the US is not part of the ICC.  This is probably 
the most likely outcome, not just because Sudan does not recognize 
the ICC, but because the regime will not want Haroun and Kosheib to 
provide damaging testimony to the ICC.
