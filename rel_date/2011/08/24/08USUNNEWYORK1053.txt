SUBJECT: UNGA: SYG HOLDS DIALOGUE WITH AMBASSADORS ON G-20 
SUMMIT, MIDDLE EAST AND DRC 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: United Nations Secretary General (SYG) Ban 
Ki-moon briefed UN General Assembly (UNGA) Members on the 
latest developments in the Middle East peace process, the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), his recent visit to Asia 
and other pressing issues in a November 10 meeting.  On the 
financial crisis, he agreed to relay Members' concerns about 
its potential impacts during the upcoming G-20 Summit in 
Washington.  Ban also discussed UNAMID force deployments, the 
November 12-13 UN Interfaith Dialogue and he pledged to 
continue to make UN operations more efficient.  END SUMMARY. 
 
G-20 SUMMIT ON THE FINANCIAL CRISIS 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  At a November 10 briefing with UNGA Ambassadors, the 
Secretary General welcomed his invitation to attend the 
November 15 Summit of G-20 leaders in Washington.  He 
characterized the Summit as a positive first step that would 
bridge into the Financing for Development Review Conference 
in Doha at the end of the month.  Ban noted President Bush's 
statement that the G-20 leaders will review the crisis' 
impacts on emerging markets and least developed countries, 
and he agreed to relay GA Members' messages on the challenges 
they are facing and their appeal that donors fulfill their 
official development assistance (ODA) pledges.  To succeed, 
the Summit should address the systemic roots of the crisis; 
examine its complex interactions with climate change and the 
food and fuel crises; and begin the process of institutional 
reform to create a "more inclusive" multilateral financial 
architecture, Ban continued.  In the ensuing discussion, 
several delegates remarked positively on Ban's attendance at 
the Summit, but argued that it should be addressed in a "more 
global" forum such as the "G-192" (i.e., the General 
Assembly). 
 
MIDDLE EAST - READOUT OF THE NOV. 9 QUARTET MEETING 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶3. The Secretary General attended the November 9 Quartet 
meeting in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where Palestinian 
President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi 
Livni reported that an agreement by the end of the year, as 
called for at Annapolis, was unlikely.  Nevertheless, Ban 
called the meeting a "landmark" as it was the first time 
senior leaders from both sides briefed the Quartet on the 
status of ongoing bilateral negotiations.  He was encouraged 
that both sides reported substantial and positive progress in 
their negotiations, and Ban reiterated his commitment to 
achieving an end to occupation and the establishment of two 
states living together in peace.  Several UN Delegates (i.e., 
Egypt, Sudan and Libya) questioned Ban whether "real" 
progress has been made and decried the "confidential nature" 
of the bilateral discussions.  They noted the UN's role in 
maintaining momentum in the coming months as Israel prepares 
to hold elections and during the United States' political 
transition. 
 
DRC - SYG HEARTENED BY THE NOV. 7 NAIROBI MEETING 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. At a November 7 emergency summit of regional Heads of 
State in Nairobi, which the Secretary General attended, 
leaders renewed their call for a cease-fire in eastern DRC 
and voiced support for a mechanism chaired by Kenyan 
President Kibaki to reach a political solution to the 
conflict.  Characterizing the meeting as "frank and open," 
Ban stated that he was encouraged by the outcome.  Delegates, 
primarily from the region, called on MONUC forces to 
establish peace and stop the "genocide and humanitarian 
crimes" perpetrated by armed groups in the DRC's North Kivu 
province.  Ban described MONUC forces as "overstretched," and 
stressed that lasting peace will only come through a 
political solution.  The DRC Ambassador appealed for 
international assistance for the Congolese population in 
North Kivu affected by the fighting.  Rwanda's Ambassador 
Nsengemana asserted that peace would not be possible with 
ex-FAR and Interahamwe "genocidal" forces still in the 
region.  Nsengemana also accused UN Assistant Secretary 
General for Peacekeeping Operations Edmund Mulet of 
 
 
disseminating "false rumors" that Rwandan forces are present 
in DRC to "pillage resources." 
 
DARFUR - UPDATE ON UNAMID DEPLOYMENTS 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. The African Union chief negotiator continues to develop a 
framework agreement for a political solution to the conflict 
in Darfur, the Secretary General reported.  He added that the 
UN plans to deploy between 14,000 and 16,000 UNAMID forces 
(60% of its total commitment) by the end of the year, and 
expects that figure to rise to 80-85 percent of the total 
commitment by March, 2009.  He remarked, however, that 
UNAMID's success will depend on the cooperation and support 
of the Government of Sudan.  Sudan's Ambassador hoped "the UN 
would be part of the solution and not part of the problem" 
and sought its backing for a "homegrown" peace initiative 
(NFI) concluded over the November 5-6 weekend. 
 
TRIP TO ASIA 
------------ 
 
¶6. On a recent trip to Asia, Ban attended the second Global 
Forum on Migration and Development in Manila, where attendees 
focused on harnessing the benefits of migration to meet 
development goals.  While at the Forum, members commented on 
the impact of the financial crisis on migrant workers and the 
lower expected remittances due to the economic downturn.  In 
India, the Secretary General met with NGO leaders to discuss 
climate change.  He also reviewed first-hand the progress of 
Nepal's democratization, calling for that country's General 
Assembly to begin its work without delay and to complete the 
drafting of its new constitution.  While in Bangladesh, Ban 
visited several microfinance projects and delivered the 
message that the UN expects free and credible parliamentary 
elections there next month. 
 
INTERFAITH DIALOGUE 
------------------- 
 
¶7. Ban welcomed the Saudi initiative to convene a November 
12-13 Interfaith Dialogue at the UN.  He expressed the 
expectation that the meeting would promote the values common 
to all religions in order to fight extremism and hatred. 
 
UN BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT REFORM 
------------------------------- 
 
¶8. In the face of the ongoing financial, food, and fuel 
crises, and the impact of climate change, the SYG observed 
that there are a number of emerging issues requiring UN 
budget and human resources.  He pledged his personal 
assistance, and that of the Secretariat, to provide resources 
in a better, more effective manner.
