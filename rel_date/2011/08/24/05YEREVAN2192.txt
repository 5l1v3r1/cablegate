SUBJECT: ARMENIAN MFA:  IRAQ ENTERS NEW PHASE FOLLOWING 
COUNCIL ELECTIONS 
 
REF: A) STATE 225860 B) YEREVAN 2183 C) YEREVAN 2157 
 
¶1. (SBU) Despite early indications that the GOAM may avoid 
public statements congratulating Iraqi authorities on 
successful Council of Representatives elections (ref B), MFA 
Spokesman Hamlet Gasparyan released a December 17 press 
statement commending the elections as "an important step in 
building a new Iraq," and reiterating Armenia's "commitment 
to support reconstruction."  "We are hopeful that the newly 
elected parliament would succeed in furthering democratic 
processes and would contribute to the unity of the nation," 
Gasparyan said in the short press statement. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Gasparyan's remarks came in response to questions 
about the Iraqi election from state-run Armenpress News 
Agency.  Hayastani Hanrapetutyun and Respublika Armenii, 
government Armenian- and Russian-language newspapers (with an 
estimated circulation of less than ten thousand combined) 
published the statement on December 20 without editorial 
comment.

COMMENT:  ARMENIAN STATEMENT REFLECTS OUR REQUEST 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (SBU) We believe Gasparyan's statement represents a 
genuine effort on the part of the MFA to act on our ref A 
request, despite the GOAM's sensitive position vis-a-vis its 
own elections problems (ref C).
