SUBJECT: PRT TIKRIT: TIKRIT LAW SCHOOL LEARNS ABOUT U.S. 
LEGAL SYSTEM 
 
 
¶1. (U) This is a PRT Tikrit, Salah ad Din (SaD) cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a first of its kind May 14 lecture, the PRT's 
Rule of Law Advisor, a Department of Justice (DOJ) 
prosecutor, gave an overview of the U.S. Justice system to 
over 40 law school students and faculty from the University 
of Tikrit's Law School and prominent members of the 
province's legal community.  In introductory remarks, SaD 
Governor Hamad Hamoud al Shakti al Qaisi reinforced the 
importance of the rule of law and necessity of a functional 
legal system to combat terrorism.  The lecture covered the 
basic operations of the U.S. federal criminal justice system, 
from the opening of an investigation to the conclusion of all 
appeals, and an overview of the structure of the U.S. federal 
court system.  As a federal prosecutor, the Rule of Law 
Advisor drew upon his personal case experience as effective 
demonstrations of prosecutorial tactics. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Dr. Amir, Dean of the University of Tikrit's Law 
School, and other members of the legal faculty, who actively 
engaged in the lecture with questions, said the lecture 
provided an excellent opportunity for the students to learn 
more about their own legal system by comparing it to the 
United States'.  After the lecture, the faculty and staff 
were able to discuss the legal concepts presented at a 
representation event hosted by the PRT.

¶4. (SBU) This first of its kind engagement for the PRT 
provided an excellent introduction to the University of 
Tikrit's Law School.  This successful meeting has opened the 
door for other visiting lecturers from the U.S. legal 
community.  In addition, it provided a good foundation for 
the PRT's efforts to develop a professional legal community 
that fosters the rule of law and gives the province's youth a 
viable alternative to the insurgency.  END SUMMARY.
