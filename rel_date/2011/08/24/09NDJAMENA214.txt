REF: A. KHARTOUM 729 
     ¶B. NDJAMENA 213 
 
¶1.  (U) This message has an Action Request for Khartoum -- 
see para 6. 
 
------------ 
KHARTOUM 729 
------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Khartoum 729, another of the Embassy's superb 
reporting and analysis efforts, confirms the potentially 
decisive impact on the Chad rebellion of the GOC's victory 
over attacking rebels led by the Union of Resistance Forces' 
(UFR's) Timan Erdimi last month.  We supply in para 5 contact 
information that Embassy Khartoum can pass to UFR's Abakar 
Tollimi and others if the rebels indicate that they want 
direct talks with the GOC at authoritative levels.

REBEL DEFECTIONS 
---------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) One sure sign of declining or collapsing morale 
among Chad rebels in Sudan is the defection count. 
Defections of Chad rebels anxious to return to Chad continue. 
 French military intelligence believes that as of June 5 over 
300 have defected since the May 4-7 incursion.  The GOC 
recently held a re-joining ceremony for some 225 rebels, 
mainly from the Union of Resistance Forces (UFR).  This 
number likely does not/not include the 200-odd rebels 
captured during the May 7 battles, but does include the 100 
that the FORMIN claimed had rallied June 4 (Ref B).  We are 
now using 300 as a round number for defections in the last 30 
days.  There are also reports of Chad government desertions 
and perhaps defections as well. 
 
---------------------- 
GOC VERY OPEN TO TALKS 
---------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The GOC remains open to direct talks with Chad 
rebel groups, including the UFR, for whomever it speaks these 
days. The FORMIN said so publicly May 21 and reiterated that 
privately to us June 5.  Although the GOC insists that it 
will deal with the rebels under the general rubric of the 
Sirte Accords -- to ward off external attempts to draft 
another negotiating document -- its position strikes us as 
more supple than that, as the welcome the GOC is giving (and 
always has given) to individual and small-group defections 
demonstrates.
