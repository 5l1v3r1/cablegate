¶1. (SBU) In a discussion with Hisham Maher, a member of the 
Foreign Minister's cabinet, and a more detailed exchange with 
First Secretary Nameera Negm, acting Chief of the the MFA's 
Legal Affairs directorate, the Embassy underscored the USG's 
determination to conclude a Comprehensive Convention on 
International Terrorism (CCIT) at the coming U.N. General 
Assembly session. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Negm said that Egypt shared the U.S. objective of 
reaching a conclusion to the CCIT in New York and promised to 
share the USG points with the MFA leadership and in New York. 
 She offered little on GOE views regarding draft CCIT 
negotiating text, but promised to provide the Embassy with 
any further information should the GOE wish to convey 
specific points with Washington.  She suggested that efforts 
to negotiate acceptable language defining terrorism would 
make progress a challenge.  Nevertheless, Egypt was keen, she 
asserted, to make progress on the issue, as Egypt was a 
supporter of the other 13 conventions outlined in reftel.
