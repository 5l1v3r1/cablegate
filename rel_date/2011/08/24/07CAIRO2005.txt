SUBJECT: MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD PARLIAMENTARIANS ATTEND 
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE EVENT 
 
REF: CAIRO 1641 
 
¶1. (U) According to Egyptian press reports, five Muslim 
Brotherhood (MB) parliamentarians, in an unusual and notable 
development, participated in a recent event at the 
Presidential Palace.  President Mubarak reportedly hosted a 
June 23 breakfast to celebrate the signing of new 
education-related legislation (details of which to be 
reported septel), at which a large number of parliamentarians 
were in attendance, including MB MP's Mahmoud Megahed, Hamdi 
Hassan, Gamal Hanafi, Sobhi Saleh, and Mohamed al Gazzar. 
First Lady Suzanne Mubarak and presidential son Gamal Mubarak 
reportedly were also present. 
 
¶2. (U) Following initial press reports about the event, an 
apparently defensive MB leadership was quoted as follows in 
the independent daily Al Dustour (reported in the June 25 
edition): "The invitation was a routine one, and the MB had 
to respond to it regardless of the conflicts between the 
group and the regime" (Deputy Supreme Guide Mohamed Habib), 
"the visit was a normal thing ... the MB considers Mubarak 
the president of all Egyptians, and we do not contest his 
legitimacy (activist senior MB member Essam El Erian), and 
"the visit was routine ... the MB MP's went to the palace and 
left like all the other MP's who attended. Also, three MB 
MP's previously attended a similar meeting at the 
Presidential Palace" (leading MB member Gamal Heshmat).  On 
June 26, Rose el Youssef (an "independent" daily widely 
believed to be funded by branches of the Egyptian security 
services, and NDP Secretary for Organization Ahmed Ezz), 
published an op-ed by board chairman Karam Gabr, noting that, 
"The visit (of the MB MP's to the Presidential Palace) stands 
as proof that the Egyptian state does not hate the MB solely 
because it is the MB.  If the MB were to take a specific 
position on whether it is a political group or a 'Da'wa' 
(proselytizing) group, it could also enjoy the fruits of 
political reform like the rest of Egyptians." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: This curious incident is illustrative of the 
paradoxical status of the MB in Egypt - a "banned 
organization" whose parliamentary representatives can attend 
an event hosted by the president.  The apparent presidential 
invitation to MB MP's stands in stark contrast to GOE umbrage 
that recent meetings held by visiting CODEL's with Egyptian 
parliamentarians have included the head of the MB's 
parliamentary bloc (reftel).
