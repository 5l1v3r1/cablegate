¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) 
Minister-President Juergen Ruettgers told the CG his recent 
visit was "very successful."  His second trip in 12 months, he 
signed an agreement on energy and environmental cooperation with 
Pennsylvania.  He was pleased with his meetings with Senators 
Lugar, Coleman, Hagel, with White House Environment Advisor 
Connaughton (they met twice) and with the Deputy Secretaries of 
Energy, Treasury and Commerce.  In NY, he had another long 
conversation with Henry Kissinger and visited the NYSE, where he 
gained a better understanding of the nuance of equity capital 
firms' roles in international markets.  Ruettgers delivered a 
foreign policy speech in Washington that was significantly 
different from a controversial one he delivered in Berlin in 
late January, which aides since revised to stress positive 
themes of Atlantic partnership.  End Summary. 
 
Second U.S. Trip 
------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Almost exactly a year after his first trip to the U.S. 
as Minister-President, Ruettgers paid a second official visit 
February 12-17 to Washington, Pittsburgh and New York.  He was 
joined by Michael Breuer, Minister for Federal and European 
Affairs and 35 others, including reps from NRW small and 
medium-sized businesses in the energy and environment technology 
areas and 11 print and TV journalists.  The visit received 
extensive media coverage in NRW and Germany-wide, which a 
business rep suggested to CG is indicative of the 
Minister-President's ambitions. 
 
Focus: Energy and Environment 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) Despite an ice and snow storm in the DC area that 
resulted in a nine hour flight delay and the cancellation of 
several events, Ruettgers considered his trip "very successful," 
as he told the CG on February 23.  He was particularly pleased 
to sign a cooperation agreement with Pennsylvania on renewable 
energy and environmental protection issues with Governor Ed 
Rendell.  Representatives of two companies based in NRW and 
Pennsylvania signed contracts on the construction of a U.S. 
plant to transform "waste coal" into diesel fuel.  A senior aide 
observed that contracts like this usually "only happen on trips 
to China."  In addition to visiting the U.S. headquarters of 
Bayer Corporation, Ruettgers also visited the Washington offices 
of 3M, UPS, and Citigroup (which together employ almost 10,000 
people in NRW), thus raising his appreciation for the major role 
U.S. business plays in the NRW economy. 
 
¶4.  (U) Ruettgers promoted heavily the themes of NRW as the 
"energy capital of Germany," if not Europe, and its energy 
efficiency technology and experience.  He was very pleased that 
White House Environment Advisor Jim Connaughton met with him and 
participated in a second event, which he interpreted as evidence 
of senior USG interest in closer cooperation.  He was also 
pleased to have met with the Deputy Secretaries of Treasury, 
Energy and Commerce, and with Senators Lugar, Coleman and Hagel 
and Congressman Delahunt (D-MA), who reportedly may visit 
Germany in April to discuss energy issues, inter alia. 
According to an aide, Ruettgers' meeting with Henry Kissinger in 
New York went very well, as did his visit to the NYSE, which 
increased his knowledge of capital markets and gave him a 
greater appreciation also of the positive role private equity 
firms and hedge funds can play, both of which have been 
controversial in German society. 
 
Revised Foreign Policy Speech 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) At a Konrad Adenauer Foundation event on February 13, 
Ruettgers delivered a significantly revised version of his 
controversial January 29 DGAP (German Council on Foreign 
Relations) speech on foreign policy, which removed language that 
had caused critical press commentary in the German national 
media.  A senior aide who accompanied Ruettgers told CG the 
January speech had been drafted largely by a friend outside 
government, and was not widely cleared in the NRW government. 
Senior Ruettgers advisors, led by State Secretary Michael 
Mertes, rewrote the text, dropping language on Islamic terrorism 
interpreted by some to be ambivalent about its roots, replacing 
it with points on energy security (calling for a common European 
energy policy and criticizing Russia for using energy as a 
political weapon), emphasizing that a strong and united Europe 
is in the U.S. interest and should not be a counterforce, and 
calling for the need to write a new chapter in the friendship 
between Europe and the U.S. in tackling international problems. 
 
Comment

DUSSELDORF 00000006  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Ruettgers trip reflected the personal importance 
he places on expanding ties with the U.S.  He clearly sees 
concrete benefits for NRW business in the energy and climate 
area and has instructed his ministers to look for ways to 
translate the progress of the last 12 months into more results. 
The visit laid further groundwork for more visits this year 
focusing on energy and education, including by Science Minister 
Andreas Pinkwart and Parliamentary Speaker Regina van Dinther. 
Ruettgers also recognizes that better knowledge of the U.S. is 
necessary if he wants to pursue politics at the national level. 
His utterances on foreign policy and relations with the U.S., as 
reflected in his revised speech, were more positive than those 
in January, suggesting that he has also gained more appreciation 
for nuance in the US-Europe dialogue.
