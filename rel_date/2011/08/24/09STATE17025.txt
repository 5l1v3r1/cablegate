¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) 
requests Posts' assistance in conducting a post-shipment 
inquiry on License 
994633 for the export of defense hardware to Senegal. Posts 
are requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern inquiry within 45 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue 
Lantern inquiry will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to 
this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Unfamiliar Foreign Intermediate 
Consignee; confirm bona 
fides of the transaction. 
 
¶4. Action Tel Aviv: Department requests that Post make 
appropriate 
inquiries to establish the bona fides of Foreign Intermediate 
Consignee 
A.D. Consultants, Ltd. as a reliable recipient of United 
States Munitions 
List (USML) items.  Conduct a site visit to the company in 
order to 
assess its business operations and on-site security.  If a 
site visit is not 
possible, please inform the PM/DTCC case officer. 
 
The following questions provide suggested guidance: 
 
-- Does A.D. Consultants have proper supporting 
documentation, including a purchase 
order from Armee de l'Air du Senegal for the transaction? 
 
-- Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and 
security procedures for handling sensitive USML items? 
 
-- When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
-- What is the nature of its business -- what types of items 
does it handle; 
does it serve as a broker? 
 
-- What types of organizations are among its typical 
customers and where are 
the customers located? 
 
-- Does the company understand the restrictions on USML 
items, especially 
the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and 
re-exports? 
 
Action Dakar:  Department requests that Post make appropriate 
inquiries to 
verify that Armee de l'Air du Senegal received the USML items 
listed on the 
license for the stated purpose. 
 
End Action Request.
