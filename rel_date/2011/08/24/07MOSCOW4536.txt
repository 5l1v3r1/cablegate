¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche September 13 to Tatiana 
Smirnova, MFA Head of the Division for European Cooperation, 
Humanitarian Cooperation Division.  Smirnova noted that the 
GOR was not planning to present criticism of other countries 
at the Human Dimension Implementation Meeting (HDIM), but 
will focus on presenting progress in Russia and on upcoming 
Russian elections.  Regarding the Azlamazyan/Educated Media 
Foundation case and Other Russia's Marches of Dissent, she 
promised to send a letter to the Ministry of the Interior 
requesting action. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Smirnova, the Russian delegation to the 
HDIM will be comprised of representatives from the Office of 
State Law of the President, the Central Voting Commission, 
Ombudsman, Public Chamber, and Ministry of Health and Social 
Development, as well as the deputy director of the Ministry 
of Justice.  She told us there was a possibility the list may 
be altered as delegates could decide to remain in Moscow 
because of the September 12 government change.
