SUBJECT: DJIBOUTI/ERITREA: TALKING POINTS FOR UNSC 
CONSULTATIONS JULY 21 
 
¶1.  This is an action request. USUN may draw from the talking 
points in paragraph 2 for the UN Security Council's July 21 
debate on Djibouti and Eritrea. 
 
¶2.  Begin talking points: 
 
-- The U.S. calls on Eritrea and Djibouti to move forward to 
resolve their border issues peacefully, in accordance with UN 
Security Council Resolution 1862 (2009).  Hostilities between 
Eritrea and Djibouti further threaten peace and security in 
the already volatile Horn of Africa. 
 
-- It is clear that Eritrea,s military action against 
Djibouti in Ras Doumeira and Doumeira Island in June 2008 led 
to an armed conflict that left 44 Djiboutian soldiers dead 
and several others wounded or missing. 
 
-- Eritrea also has failed to comply with Resolution 1862, 
namely the withdrawal of its troops from the contested area, 
engaging in dialogue 
with Djibouti, and the initiation of discussions with the 
United Nations. 
 
-- On July 13 Eritrea further exhibited its lack of 
cooperation with the international community when it 
cancelled the Sanctions Monitoring Group,s planned visit to 
the country. 
 
-- Moreover, the UN Monitoring Group on Somalia has noted in 
its reports that Eritrea has provided funding, weapons, and 
training to armed insurgent groups that perpetuate war in 
Somalia. 
 
-- The USG and the international community are willing to 
engage the Eritrean government should the Government of 
Eritrea end its destabilizing activities in the Horn of 
African and take steps toward improved bilateral relations. 
 
-- The U.S. calls on both sides, especially Eritrea, to cease 
all military 
hostilities immediately, withdraw troops from the border 
area, and find a peaceful solution to the conflict. 
 
-- Both parties should take steps to avoid further conflict 
in a region that is already facing tremendous instability. 
 
--If Eritrea does not respond to calls by the international 
community to reverse its destabilizing role in the region, 
the Security Council will need to consider what additional 
action to take.
