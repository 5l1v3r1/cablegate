"best practices".  Morocco is prepared to host the 
approximated 120 security, customs, intelligence, regulatory,

Initiative partner nations. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Morocco proposes the following themes for the 
three-day event: 1) assessing the phenomenon of illicit 
trafficking, 2) international instruments and initiatives, 3) 
establishing capabilities to detect illicit trafficking, 4)

examples from Malaysia, Pakistan, Ukraine, and others, and 5)
