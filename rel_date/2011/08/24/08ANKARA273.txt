In Today's Papers 
 
Turban Debate Intensifies with Party Leaders' Criticisms 
All papers carry Prime Minister Erdogan's harsh criticisms against 
the media and Deniz Baykal, leader of Turkey's main political 
opposition party.  In response, Baykal called the ruling AKP's 
efforts to change the constitution an "assault on the republic." 
Erdogan lashed out at the media for "exaggerating the confusion" 
over turban reforms, which were passed by the ruling AKP and the 
right-wing nationalist MHP.  Erdogan said "some media groups" were 
trying to portray Turkey as a country divided into two hostile 
groups.  He particularly targeted the Dogan Media Group saying that 
the tense headlines in the group's papers were actually efforts to 
manipulate the issue.  "Their concern is not democracy, but fears 
that their interests could be harmed," Erdogan said.  The PM also 
responded to CHP leader Deniz Baykal for saying the AKP leaders 
should be ready to "face the gallows" over their efforts to reform 
the constitution.  "What kind of democrat are you, suggesting we are 
headed to the gallows?  We have been wearing white robes and are 
ready to pay the price for our actions," stressed an angry Erdogan. 
Papers infer Erdogan is referring to the traditional white shrouds 
used in Muslim burials. 
 
Opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal told his party group meeting 
yesterday, "You can put a headscarf on a person but you cannot put 
it on the state," adding it was not proper to place "an Islamic 
tradition" in the Turkish Constitution.  Baykal also responded to 
Erdogan's harsh remarks, "Don't wear the white robe -- we don't want 
to see you in robes or chadors, but as a respected, law abiding 
prime minister who suits modern Turkey."  Baykal noted his party's 
efforts were aimed at the elimination of the AKP at the ballot box. 
 
 
Opposition MHP leader Devlet Bahceli told his deputies that MHP was 
seeking "moral satisfaction" and not political gains on the 
headscarf issue.  "The use of headscarf as an ideological symbol 
against the regime in Turkey cannot be tolerated," Bahceli 
emphasized.  Bahceli added "if we are going to prevent veils or 
burqas in universities, it is mandatory to make adjustments to 
article 17 of higher education law." 
 
Meanwhile, the pro-Kurdish DTP lawmaker Ahmet Turk urged the 
government to seek consensus for the democratization of the 
constitution.  He expressed disappointment that the government made 
no effort regarding "the rights of the Kurds and minorities" in 
Turkey while working to amend the constitution. 
 
On Tuesday, groups of students gathered in university campuses in 
Izmir, Kocaeli, Adana, and Mersin to protest against the AKP-MHP 
turban proposal, shouting slogans "Turkey is secular and will remain 
secular."  The students issued a statement criticizing "certain 
circles" for trying to polarize the country. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turban Debates 
Left-leaning Taraf's chief editor Ahmet Altan writes (2/13): 
"Additional provocation during the current headscarf controversy is 
dangerous.  The ruling AKP must take the lead to end the hostility. 
The only thing the AKP can do now is to take determined steps 
forward regarding Turkey's EU-related reforms.  Such efforts would 
relieve doubts among the AKP's adversaries.  This is the only way to 
alleviate the possibility that Turkey could turn into a hell-like 
inferno because of provocative attacks.  Some still want to incite 
clashes in universities, launch bomb attacks, and plot political 
assassinations.  For the liberation of us all, the AKP has to become 
the party of "liberation."  The fact that our lives depend on such a 
condition is also distressing." 
 
Abdulhamit Bilici observes in the Islamist-oriented Zaman (2/13): 
"It's not fair to claim that Prime Minister Erdogan's priority is to 
"Islamicize" Turkey by removing the ban on turban in a country where 
 
ANKARA 00000273  002 OF 003 
 
 
almost 80 percent of its people support headscarf freedom. 
International human rights organizations such as Amnesty 
International and Human Rights Watch deem the turban ban in Turkish 
universities a violation of human rights; these organizations 
support its removal.  Newsweek, also, sees the AKP's turban 
initiative as a move toward liberation, underlining that it stands 
closer to the freedom of religion in the western sense that what AKP 
adversaries want.  However, this is a test for Erdogan.  Will he 
pass more EU reforms or will he merely comply with the demands of 
the AKP's grassroots' support?" 
 
Barak in Turkey to Sell Israeli Missile, Satellite Systems 
All papers report visiting Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak met 
yesterday with Prime Minister Erdogan and Defense Minister Vecdi 
Gonul.  Papers highlight that Barak wanted to sell Turkey missile 
defense and satellite systems after the high-level Israeli 
delegation came to lobby for the sale of Allow missile systems and 
Ofek spy satellites.  Mainstream tabloid Aksam says Turkey will buy 
ten Heron unmanned spy aircraft from Israel. Barak and his Turkish 
counterpart Gonul signed a 15-part military agreement, but details 
of the agreement were not released.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak 
and Zaman as well mainstream papers report Erdogan asked Barak to 
stop Israeli attacks against Gaza and end the blockade on the 
region.  "We are exerting great efforts for Israel and Palestine to 
live in peace side by side.  We thank Israel for its support to 
Turkey's defense industry, and also thank Mr. Barak for sending 
equipment that Turkey can use in the southeast and in cross border 
operations," Gonul stressed.  Barak also met with Foreign Minister 
Ali Babacan later in the day in a meeting closed to the press. 
 
Urbancic on the PKK 
Hurriyet, Cumhuriyet and Zaman report Deputy Coordinator for Counter 
Terrorism, Frank Urbancic, told journalists at a roundtable Tuesday 
the US would apply the "Al Capone model" in fighting against the PKK 
presence in European countries.  Urbancic said, despite all of Al 
Capone's known criminal activities, authorities in the US could only 
arrest him over a tax offense.  Urbancic said the US would use the 
same method against the PKK.  "The PKK works like the Mafia in 
Europe -- they fundraise in Belgium, operate television broadcasts 
in Denmark, where free speech is deemed essential, and they're 
involved in money laundering and drug trafficking across Europe. 
Urbancic emphasized, "The PKK terrorist organization in Europe is 
like an octopus."
