REF: STATE 105422 
 
(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points outlining USG concerns 
about the post-hurricane humanitarian situation in Cuba to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Multilateral Affairs Officer 
Gustavo Argueta on October 8.  Argueta pointed out that this 
is not the first time the USG has offered aid to Cuba and 
been denied by the Cuban regime.  He said it was a difficult 
situation, particularly because few NGOs are able to operate 
in Cuba.  Argueta suggested that the USG use multilateral 
channels to offer humanitarian assistance.
