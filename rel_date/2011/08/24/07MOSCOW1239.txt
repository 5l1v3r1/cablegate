THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT 
ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1. (SBU) On March 21 we delivered Ref A letter regarding the 
proposed bilateral bioterrorism working group meeting to 
Sergey Belousko, Attache, and Mikhail Shurgalin, the Director 
of the Information Section of the MFA's Department of New 
Challenges and Threats.  Shurgalin said he would share the 
letter with New Challenges and Threats Deputy Director 
Vladimir Andreyev immediately, and would provide us with a 
preliminary reaction as soon as possible. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Shurgalin noted that he and Belousko had discussed 
the issue generally with OES/IHA officials on the margins of 
the recent Forensic Epidemiology Workshop in London (Ref B). 
Belousko confided that it was unlikely the proposed bilateral 
meeting could be held as soon as April 2007, because it would 
take time to discuss the goals of the meeting with other 
agencies and ministries.  He said it would also take time to 
determine the appropriate Russian officials who should attend.
