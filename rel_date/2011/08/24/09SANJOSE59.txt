SUBJECT: DESIGNATION OF ADDITIONAL IRANIAN ENTITIES UNDER 
E.O. 13382 
 
REF: 08 STATE 133198 
 
(SBU) On January 26, we informed Carlos Cordero of the MFA's 
Department of Disarmament, Terrorism and Organized Crime that 
on December 17, 2008 the USG designated two Iranian entities 
of proliferation concern under E.O. 13382 (reftel).  Cordero 
appreciated the U.S. designation but offered no substantive 
response on Costa Rica undertaking similar measures. 
However, he said the MFA, per GOCR established procedures 
regarding U.S. designations, would notify Costa Rica's 
banking oversight agencies and Costa Rica's intelligence 
service (DIS) on an advisory basis.
