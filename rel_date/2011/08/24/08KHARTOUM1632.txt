Congratulations on the Occasion of the 2008 Presidential Elections 
 
 
 The Executive Office of the General Fur Shora Council seizes the 
opportunity of the successful Presidential Elections in the United 
States of America, to present its Congratulations for the American 
people for showing clearly for the whole world that they are really 
Great People, a Great Nation and a Great Country. 
 
 They have shown to the whole World how real Democracy, Freedom, 
Equality and Justice can be practiced at all levels. 
 
 The Blacks Americans in general and the African-American, 
specially, have nothing to complain for as of today but to be 
proud. 
 
 We, in Darfur, remember that United States of America with great 
respect and affection when they led the International Community 
twice to help us in Darfur, first when drought hit Darfur in 1983, 
at the time of the Late President Ronald Reagan, and again after 
twenty years from that time, in 2004 when we faced the biggest 
Humanitarian Crises in history, they were the first to come to help 
and are still helping. 
 
 So God help this Country to overcome it problems to continue 
participating and saving the World
