 ¶1. (U) In an April 25 formal meeting, the United Nations 
Security Council (UNSC) adopted a Congolese-drafted 
Presidential Statement (PRST) addressing the situation 
between Chad and Sudan.  Last-minute edits to the text 
resulted in deletion of our proposed reference to a pending 
European Union Mission to Chad, since even EU Council Members 
knew nothing about it.  The PRST was adopted as UN document 
S/PRST/2006/19; text in Paragraph 2. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin PRST text: 
 
The Security Council welcomes the Secretary-General's 
briefing on 18 April 2006 on Chad/Sudan relations and 
endorses his deep concerns over the political and security 
situation and the instability along Chad's borders with 
Sudan, as well as over the possible spillover effects of 
these crises on neighboring countries and the entire region. 
The Security Council encourages the Secretary-General to 
continue his consultations with relevant parties, in 
particular the African Union, on the matter and requests him 
to closely follow the situation and continue to keep the 
Security Council informed. 
 
The Security Council welcomes the fact-finding mission 
dispatched by the African Union in Chad and looks forward to 
its conclusions. 
 
The Security Council fully endorses the statement by the 
African Union Peace and Security Council of 13 April 2006 in 
which it strongly condemned the rebel attacks against 
N'djamena and the eastern town of Adre and reiterates that 
any attempt to seize power by force, pursuant to the 1999 
Algiers Declaration of the African Unity Organization, would 
be regarded as unacceptable. 
 
The Security Council calls for political dialogue and a 
negotiated solution to the continuing crisis within Chad. 
 
The Security Council also reaffirms the sovereignty, 
independence and territorial integrity of Chad and Sudan as 
well as all States in the region and calls on all Members to 
refrain in their international relations from the threat or 
use of force against the territorial integrity or political 
independence of any state, or in any other manner 
inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. 
 
The Security Council calls upon on States in the region to 
cooperate in ensuring their common stability. 
 
The Security Council notes with deep concerns the 
deteriorating relations between Chad and Sudan and urges the 
Governments of the two countries to abide by their 
obligations under the 8 February 2006 Tripoli Agreement and 
to urgently start implementing the confidence-building 
measures which have been voluntarily agreed upon.  Both Sudan 
and Chad must refrain from any actions that violate the 
border. 
 
The Security Council is concerned about the situation of the 
refugees from the Darfur region of Sudan and from the Central 
African Republic as well as the situation of the thousands of 
internally displaced persons in Chad.  It therefore notes the 
decision by the Government of Chad not to expel the Sudanese 
refugees and urges the Government of Chad to continue 
supporting the efforts of humanitarian and relief agencies in 
the country in accordance with international principles 
governing the protection of refugees.  The Security Council 
further reminds the right of all displaced persons who wish 
to do so to return to their home.  It reminds all Governments 
in the region of their obligation to respect international 
humanitarian law.  In this regard, the Security Council calls 
on donor countries to provide additional resources to respond 
to the emergency humanitarian situation in both Sudan and 
Chad.
