Republic of Sudan 
Permanent Mission to the United Nations 
New York 
 
Ref. 264/06 
 
The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Sudan to the United 
Nations presents its compliments to the Permanent Mission of 
(country name) to the United Nations, and with reference to 
the Secretariat note Verbale DPKO/PD/NV/2006-00124 dated 
September 22nd, 2006 (attached) concerning the invitation 
addressed to Troops Contributing Countries and Police 
Contributing Countries to nominate Police personnel, have the 
honour to convey the following clarifications: 
 
(1) Sudan's unequivocal position pertaining to Security 
Council Resolution 1706 is total rejection for the various 
reasons repeatedly reiterated by Sudan. 
 
(2) In the absence of Sudan's consent to the deployment of UN 
troops, any volunteering to provide peace keeping troops to 
Darfur will be considered as a hostile act, a prelude to an 
invasion of a member country of the UN. 
 
(3) Sudan fully supports augmenting the African Union forces 
with all 
reinforcement means in order that they discharge their 
Responsibilities 
enshrined in the Abuja Agreement. 
 
(4) Care is required in dealing with CPA and DPA, as UNMIS is 
crafted to 
serve the agreed upon CPA requirements and mandate. 
 
The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Sudan to the United 
Nations avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the 
Permanent Mission of New Zealand to the United Nations the 
assurances of its highest consideration.
