¶1.  (SBU) Following repeated attempts to schedule an acceptable date 
for ConGen POL/ECON Officer and LES to visit Oberland Arms, the firm 
refused our requested visit via the following e-mail, translated 
from German: 
 
Begin text: 
Dear Dr. Wilhelm (LES Econ Specialist) -- Thank you for your 
patience in this matter.  After careful deliberations we have 
decided to not provide U.S. authorities access to our firm's 
documents.  The reasons (for denying access) are that our clients 
are entitled to data protection and that we need to safeguard our 
firm's secrets. 
 
We will cancel both orders and will ask our U.S. suppliers to 
withdraw applications for export approval. 
 
We can understand that the U.S. is interested in monitoring 
cross-border trade.  To make sure that U.S. export/ re-export 
regulations are observed we have added the following reference to 
our website (http://www.oberlandarms.com/index.php): 
 
According to U.S. Export Law, Oberland Arms OHG is not selling 
Products, Parts or Components of U.S. origin outside of Germany. 
Parts of German/European origin that contain U.S. Parts, are also 
only sold in Germany. 
 
Furthermore I registered for a course at the foreign trade academy, 
register form attached (for a July course on U.S. export control 
laws). 
 
I hope that you can understand our decision. 
 
Regards, 
Frank Satzinger
