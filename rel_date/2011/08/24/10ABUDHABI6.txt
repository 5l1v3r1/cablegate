¶1. (SBU) On December 16, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD) 
announced it would provide AED 2.4 billion (USD 650 million) in 
assistance to Yemen, to include development projects including 
infrastructure, energy, water, transport and education. On December 
30, ADFD Acting Director General Mohammed Saif Al Suwaidi told 
EconOff that the announcement includes a UAE grant pledged in 
London several years ago.  (Note: Press reports indicate ADFD 
pledged AED 1.3 billion (USD 354 million) for Yemen at the 2006 
London Conference. End Note.) The grant was later converted to a 
loan, and most recently an MOU.  Al Suwaidi said the ADFD expects 
to fund 14 projects in Yemen.  One project will develop a national 
identification card program, in conjunction with the UAE Ministry 
of Interior, modeled after the UAE national ID program.  The UAE 
Red Crescent will receive AED 100 million (USD 27 million) from 
ADFD to build housing in Hadramaut. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Given UAE officials' concern about Yemen's 
political, economic and security situation, the funding is not 
surprising and the ADFD is likely only one of several avenues for 
UAE support.  UAE officials report additional military assistance 
may be funneled through the UAE armed forces.  Senior MFA officials 
report the UAE is interested in discussing how best to coordinate 
humanitarian and development aid for Yemen with the United States, 
the UK and other partners.  End Comment.
