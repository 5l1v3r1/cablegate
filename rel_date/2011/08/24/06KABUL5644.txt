SUBJECT: CODEL DREIER AND PRESIDENT KARZAI ON PAKISTAN, 
MUSA QALA, CORRUPTION, AND POLITICAL PARTIES 
 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In their November 26 meeting with President Karzai, 
Representatives David Dreier (R-CA), David Price (D-NC), Lois 
Capps (D-CA), and Earl Pomeroy (D-ND) reaffirmed the USG's 
unwavering commitment to providing development assistance and 
combating terrorism in Afghanistan.  The congressional 
delegation (CODEL) also discussed Afghanistan's engagement 
with Pakistan, public perceptions of the Musa Qala Agreement, 
corruption and political parties.  The CODEL informed Karzai 
of its recent contribution to the library of the Afghan 
Parliament and encouraged the GOA to use prosecutions of 
high-profile anti-corruption cases to signal that corruption 
will no longer be tolerated.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
CODEL DREIER'S THOUGHTS ON THE AFGHAN PARLIAMENT 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Remarking on his visit to the Afghan Parliament, 
Representative Dreier told Karzai how much he was impressed 
by the parliamentarians.  Dreier explained that during his 
Parliamentary visit he signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
with Acting Secretary General of the Lower House Ghulam 
Hassan Gran pledging a donation of a core collection of 
written materials and technical training for the 
Parliament,s library staff.  He also suggested that the GOA 
and USG work together to find ways to ensure Afghan MP's have 
greater opportunities to interact with the PRT's.  Karzai 
agreed, noting that "the more we decentralize, the better 
we'll be able to govern." 
 
------------------------ 
ENGAGEMENT WITH PAKISTAN 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Karzai used the meeting as an opportunity to 
highlight his concerns about Islamic extremism in Pakistan. 
He noted that he was hearing bad things from Pakistan over 
the last two days, referring to threats reportedly made 
against Afghanistan by Lt. Gen. Ali Mohammad Jan Aurakzai, 
Governor of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province.  When 
asked what the USG could do to help, Karzai encouraged the 
USG to have a frank talk with Pakistan emphasizing that they 
cannot become an Islamic power by relying on extremists. 
"Tell them you will hang on in Afghanistan until (the USG) is 
sure the border area is secure," Karzai suggested. 
 
------------------------------- 
PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF MUSA QALA 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Regarding the Musa Qala Agreement, Karzai noted that 
he was taking great pains to stress to the Afghan People and 
international community that the GOA will under no 
circumstances negotiate with the Taliban. He alleged that 
Pakistan was, in fact,  conducting such negotiations.  He 
acknowledged the Afghan public was particularly suspicious of 
the Musa Qala Agreement precisely because of how soon it 
followed Pakistan's North Waziristan Agreement.  He said that 
the timing of the two agreements had given some Afghans the 
impression that both governments were negotiating with the 
Taliban and providing them safe havens along the border area. 
 Karzai stressed that this was not the case in Afghanistan 
and noted that the agreement is one between the British, the 
governor of Helmand province, and tribal elders living in 
Musa Qala.  He reiterated that if Taliban elements resisted 
ANP efforts to maintain order in Musa Qala, "We will crush 
them."

CORRUPTION AND AFGHANISTAN'S NEW "GUNSLINGER", AG SABIT 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
KABUL 00005644  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) When asked about efforts to stem corruption, Karzai 
noted that previous efforts had been hampered by a weak law 
enforcement and a weak Attorney General.  He highlighted his 
recent appointment of Attorney General Sabit as a turning 
point for the campaign against corruption.  He likened Sabit 
to a gunslinger in old Western movies who takes no prisoners 
and voraciously goes after corrupt officials.  He observed 
that Sabit's public persona helped to create a new 
environment in Afghanistan that both exposes and rejects 
corruption.  He stressed that the GOA had a measured plan of 
action which would be very focused on three initiatives: 
thoroughly prosecuting a small number of high-profile cases 
against corrupt officials, "right-sizing" GOA ministries that 
have grown too large, and paying adequate salaries to all 
civil service employees. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
KARZAI HAS NO INTENTIONS OF CREATING POLITICAL PARTIES 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) In response to CODEL,s question about forming his 
own political party, Karzai reflected on his role as 
President at this stage of Afghanistan's political 
development.  He stressed that it is essential to project 
himself as a "President for all Afghans," explaining that 
this idea lies behind his decision not to support development 
of political parties in Afghanistan.  Given the sour taste 
that past actions by political parties and military 
coalitions have left in the mouths of the Afghan public, 
Karzai noted that any action on his part to create a party 
system would lead the Afghan people to view him as a 
President only for the people of the party he sought to 
create - not as a President for all Afghans.
