GROUND 
 
¶1.  (SBU) As the PRT continues its transition to the 
UK, an advance group of British soldiers has begun 
dismounted patrols in Helmand Province's capital, 
Lashkar Gah.  Early indications appear positive.  Up 
to the arrival of the UK troops, there have been no 
such patrols, as US forces use mounted patrols as 
their standard operating procedure. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) UK officers view dismounted patrols as a 
key component to improving security in the area. 
According to the officers, when citizens see 
soldiers on foot and interacting with local 
merchants and inhabitants, it mitigates risk and 
should lead to better overall knowledge of the area 
of operations.  They said that dismounted patrols 
will be a regular feature of the UK deployment. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) PRT poloff accompanied a UK dismounted 
patrol on February 14.  Despite language barriers, 
soldiers interacted comfortably with local people. 
Young people, especially, were very anxious to 
interact with the troops and try out their English. 
Several teenagers spoke English fairly well.  PRToff 
and soldiers exchanged greetings with numerous 
shopkeepers and others encountered along the route. 
Quite a few young people asked to have their photos 
taken. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Several citizens said that they were happy 
to see the UK troops.  Some told us that they had 
heard reports on local radio and television that 
there would be 3,000 troops eventually deployed in 
the province.  As we have heard in many other fora, 
security is a major concern of most citizens. 
Soldiers, quite a few of whom are veterans of other 
stability operations, said that they also enjoyed 
interacting with local citizens.  A couple of times, 
the soldiers helped out citizens - in one case, 
righting a load that had fallen off a bicycle. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  Based on the first few patrols, 
dismounted patrols appear to be a positive 
development in facilitating relations between the 
Coalition and local people.  A foot patrol through 
town is likely to make citizens feel more secure and 
foster improved familiarity between the Coalition 
and the people.  END COMMENT.
