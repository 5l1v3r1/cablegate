Embassy Vienna conveyed ref (a) demarche to Austrian MFA 
Middle East Bureau on April 12.  On April 14, EconPolCouns 
and Pol Unit Chief reiterated the request for an increased 
Austrian contribution to UNRWA during a meeting with 
A/S-equivalent Ralph Scheide and Israel/Palestine desk 
officer Wolfgang Lapuh (ref b).  Lapuh said that MFA's 
Development Assistance Bureau had responded to the emergency 
appeal by substantially increasing Austria's annual 
contribution, to 1.5 million euros.  Lapuh observed that this 
represented a multiple of Austrian assistance to RWA in 
pre-intifada days (roughly $300,000 per year) and nearly a 
doubling of the 2004 aid level.  We thanked Scheide and Lapuh 
for their help in securing the additional funds.
