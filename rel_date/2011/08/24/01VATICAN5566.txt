POPE DECRIES MIDDLE EAST VIOLENCE 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.   POPE JOHN PAUL II DEPLORED THE CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN 
ISRAELI TROOPS AND PALESTINIANS IN THE WEST BANK TOWNS OF 
BETHLEHEM, BEIT JALA AND BEIT SAHOUR. IN AN OCTOBER 21 ADDRESS 
IN VATICAN CITY, HE SAID THE VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAS A 
"PATH OF DEATH, WHICH DISHONORS GOD'S NAME." THE POPE 
EXPRESSED PARTICULAR CONCERN THAT "WAR AND DEATH HAVE EVEN 
ARRIVED AT THE SQUARE OF THE BASILICA OF THE NATIVITY OF OUR 
LORD." THE POPE SAID IT MUST BE "EVERYONE'S COMMITMENT TO MAKE 
THIS (THE HOLY LAND) FINALLY A LAND OF PEACE AND FRATERNITY."

POPE REACHES OUT TO CHINA - AGAIN 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3.   POPE JOHN PAUL II HAS ISSUED AN APOLOGY TO CHINA FOR ANY 
ACTIONS TAKEN BY CATHOLICS THAT OFFENDED CHINA OR GAVE THE 
IMPRESSION OF DISRESPECT FOR ITS CULTURE. THE POPE'S OCTOBER 
24 MESSAGE WAS ADDRESSED TO AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN 
ROME, ITALY MARKING FOUR CENTURIES SINCE THE ARRIVAL OF JESUIT

MISSIONARY MATTEO RICCI IN BEIJING. THE POPE WROTE THAT 
PERSONAL LIMITATIONS, POLITICAL PRESSURE AND THEOLOGICAL 
DISPUTES SOMETIMES LED TO TENSIONS AND MISTRUST BETWEEN CHINA 
AND THE VATICAN. THE POPE OPINED THAT SUCH MISTRUST OFFSET THE 
"GOOD WORK" ACCOMPLISHED BY MISSIONARIES IN PREACHING THE 
CHRISTIAN MESSAGE, EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE. POPE JOHN PAUL 
EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT "CONCRETE FORMS OF COMMUNICATION AND 
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE HOLY SEE AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF 
CHINA MAY SOON BE ESTABLISHED." (NOTE: THE VATICAN HAS 
REPEATEDLY SAID IT WOULD MOVE ITS DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION 
"OVERNIGHT" FROM TAIPEI TO BEIJING AS SOON AS CHINA AGREES TO 
NORMALIZE DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  AT ISSUE IS THE VATICAN'S 
RELIGIOUS JURISDICTION OVER THE 10-15 MILLION CATHOLICS IN 
CHINA, INCLUDING THE VATICAN'S RIGHT TO ORDAIN BISHOPS FREE 
FROM STATE INTERFERENCE.  END NOTE.) THE POPE SAID, "THE 
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE HOLY SEE 
WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE POSITIVE REPERCUSSIONS FOR HUMANITY'S 
PROGRESS." TAIWAN'S AMBASSADOR TO THE HOLY SEE EXPRESSED DOUBT 
THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WOULD RESPOND FAVORABLY TO THE 
POPE'S OVERTURE TO BEIJING, WHICH HE DEFINED AS "EXCEPTIONAL." 
(SEPTEL TO FOLLOW).

------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.   CARITAS INTERNATIONAL, THE CONFEDERATION OF CATHOLIC 
RELIEF AGENCIES, HAS LAUNCHED AN APPEAL FOR US DOLLARS 11 
MILLION TO FUND ITS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR AFGHAN REFUGEES. 
CARITAS SAID THE MONEY WOULD BE USED TO CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE FLED THEIR HOMES SINCE THE START OF THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN

PAGE 04        VATICA  05566  01 OF 02  261515Z 
IN AFGHANISTAN, AS WELL AS THOSE ALREADY IN CAMPS IN PAKISTAN. 
CARITAS SAID THE MILITARY ACTION WAS COMPOUNDING AN ALREADY 
SERIOUS HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN AFGHANISTAN, WHICH HAS SUFFERED 
THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF DROUGHT AND 22 YEARS OF WAR. 
MEANWHILE, THE VATICAN'S OBSERVER TO THE U.N. AGENCIES IN 
GENEVA, ARCHBISHOP DIARMUID MARTIN HIGHLIGHTED THE FORCED 
DISPLACEMENT OF LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE, SUCH AS THE AFGHAN 
PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR HOMES TO AVOID THE CURRENT MILITARY 
ACTION. ADDRESSING A MEETING OF UNHCR, THE ARCHBISHOP SAID THE 
LACK OF PROTECTION FOR REFUGEES IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY 
CRITICAL INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM.

STATES, "IF IT IS THE OBLIGATION OF NATIONS TO ELIMINATE 
TERRORISM," THE DUTY OF UNESCO, "CONSISTS IN DOING EVERYTHING 
POSSIBLE SO THAT THE FUTURE IS ONE OF A DIALOGUE OF CULTURES 
AIMED AT BUILDING PEACE." HE SAID UNESCO CAN BE A "CATALYST" 
FOR A DEEPER REFLECTION ON THE ETHICAL ISSUES CONNECTED WITH 
LIFE, EDUCATION, POVERTY, ECONOMICS, NEW TECHNOLOGY "AND 
ESPECIALLY, GLOBALIZATION."

VATICAN RATIFIES TWO PROTOCOLS TO PROTECT CHILDREN 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶6.   THE VATICAN'S REPRESENTATIVE AT THE UNITED NATIONS, 
ARCHBISHOP RENATO MARTINO, HAS DEPOSITED THE INSTRUMENTS OF 
RATIFICATION FOR A PROTOCOL ON CHILDREN IN ARMED CONFLICT AND 
ANOTHER TO PROHIBIT THE SALE OF CHILDREN, CHILD PROSTITUTION 
AND CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, BOTH SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTS TO THE 
CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. DURING A JOINT PRESS 
CONFERENCE WITH MARTINO THE UN SECRETARY-GENERAL'S SPECIAL 
REPRESENTATIVE FOR CHILDREN AND ARMED CONFLICT, OLARA OTUNNA, 
SAID VATICAN SUPPORT FOR THE PROTOCOL ADDED A WHOLE NEW 
MOMENTUM TO THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE USE OF CHILD SOLDIERS. HE 
SAID THE VATICAN HAD A SPECIAL "MORAL PLATFORM" FOR USE IN 
EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE OTHER STATES. THE VATICAN WAS THE SEVENTH 
STATE TO RATIFY THE PROTOCOL AFTER CANADA, BANGLADESH, SRI 
LANKA, ANDORRA, PANAMA AND ICELAND. NICHOLSON
