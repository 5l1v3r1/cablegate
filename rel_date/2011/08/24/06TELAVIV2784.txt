SUBJECT: KNESSET SPEAKER EXPRESSES SUPPORT FOR ADVANCING 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING, OTHER LEGISLATION 
 
¶1.  (SBU) During his July 12 meeting with Knesset Speaker 
Dalia Itzik (septel), the Ambassador asked for Itzik's 
support in advancing legislative initiatives in three areas: 
anti-trafficking in labor, copyright law, and export 
controls.  Regarding the first, the Ambassador noted that 
Israel's current anti-trafficking laws do not prohibit 
trafficking in labor.  Itzik said that she would check to see 
how she could push forward the legislation currently pending 
in the Knesset that addresses this issue.  She also told the 
Ambassador that she would check on the status of draft 
copyright legislation currently before the Knesset. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador also requested Itzik's support for 
export control legislation that would, inter alia, provide a 
basis for better handling of dual use issues.  Itzik noted 
that the GOI had not yet submitted draft legislation on this 
issue to the Knesset.  The Ambassador said that the 
legislation may be presented soon after the Knesset recess, 
scheduled to last from July 20 until mid-October.  Itzik's 
diplomatic advisor, Ambassador Ya'akov Levy, who also 
attended the meeting, said that "we will be very mindful" of 
this issue after the recess; Itzik indicated that she agreed.
