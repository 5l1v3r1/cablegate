In response to the reftel Leahy vetting requests, the 
Department has reviewed its files and finds it does not, at 
this time, possess credible information of gross human rights 
violations by the members and units of the Lebanese Internal 
Security Forces listed in reftels. If at any time the Embassy 
becomes aware of credible information that these individuals 
or units have been involved in gross human rights violations, 
the Embassy should so inform the Department.
