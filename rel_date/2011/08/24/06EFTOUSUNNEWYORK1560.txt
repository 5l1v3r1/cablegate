 ¶1.  This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  ACTION REQUEST:  USUN has received a note verbale from 
the Syrian Mission to the UN which requests an explanation 
for the delay experienced by Syrian PermRep Ja'afari on 
arrival at Kennedy Airport on  July 6.  According to the 
note, Ja'afari was told that the delay in admitting him was 
because the State Department had added his name to "a 
system".  USUN requests guidance for a reply. 
 
¶3.  Begin text of note dated August 15, 2006 from the 
Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United 
Nations: (complimentary salutation)...and has the honour to 
inform that upon the arrival of the newly appointed Syrian 
Ambassador to the United Nations, H.E. Dr. Bashar JA'AFARI, 
on 6 July 2006 at JFK Intl. Airport, the Ambassador was asked 
to step aside without clarification and he was escorted to a 
small room.  The Ambassador was completely surprised by such 
unusual procedures, which violates Vienna Convention and the 
Host Country commitments.  After over 15 minutes of this 
delay, the Syrian Ambassador was allowed to exit the airport. 
 The officer justified this delay by referring to the fact 
that the name of the Ambassador was added to their system by 
the State Department, and that they have to follow such 
procedures in these cases. 
 
The Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic to the 
United Nations wishes to draw your kind attention that this 
was not the first time such thing happened.  Some Syrian 
diplomats had previously faced similar situation. 
 
The Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic to the 
United Nations would like to receive an explanation to this 
dangerous breach of the commitments of the Host Country, and 
to assure that no such incident occur in the future. 
(complimentary close).  End text.
