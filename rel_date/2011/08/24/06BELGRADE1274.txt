UNSCR text as requested reftel to FONMIN 
Draskovic at his home at 1300L.  Draskovic

¶2.  (U)  We expect Serbia will fully support the 
letter and spirit of the UNSCR (their default

on other UN issues in the recent past).  We will 
continue to track the government's reactions and 
report any pertinent developments.
