SUBJECT: TURKEY-GREECE-ITALY PIPELINE - EDISON DISCUSSIONS 
WITH TURKEY 
 
REF: ROME 2698 
 
¶1.  Roberto Poti, Edison Vice President for Business 
Development, called EconCounselor September 18 to relate 
details of his September 11 meeting with Turkish Energy 
Minister Hilmi Guler regarding the Turkey-Greece-Italy (TGI) 
pipeline construction. 
 
¶2. Poti described the meeting as "very positive."  Guler 
reportedly confirmed the GOT,s commitment to the TGI project 
and said Turkey wishes to re-open negotiations to formalize a 
"transit" contract for Azeri gas exported to Greece and Italy 
via Turkey.  Guler said he had spoken with EUR DAS Bryza and 
told Bryza that Turkey's first priority is completion of the 
TGI, even if Turkey is only able to participate as a transit 
country.  (Note: As reported reftel, a principal concern for 
Edison regarding the TGI is Turkey's desire to become not 
only a transit country for natural gas, but also a 
seller/distributor.  End Note.) 
 
¶3. Guler also said the GOT wants to consider becoming a 
signatory to the Italian-Greek intergovernmental agreement 
regarding the TGI as a way to speed completion of the 
pipeline. (Note: This bilateral framework agreement, signed 
November 4, 2005, commits both governments to spur TGI 
completion by quickly providing all the necessary government 
permits.  Our understanding is that the agreement does not 
address how the construction will be funded.  End note.) 
 
¶4.  On the issue of what gas the TGI will carry, Guler 
reportedly told Poti that Turkey places a priority on the 
TGI's carrying Azeri natural gas, and specifically stated 
that the GOT "would have problems" with the export of Iranian 
natural gas via the TGI.
