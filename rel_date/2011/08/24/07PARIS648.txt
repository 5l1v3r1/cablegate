¶1. (SBU) French MFA Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) desk 
officer, Michel Clerx, told us on February 20 that France 
fully supported all of the points in the U.S. non-paper 
provided in reftel, including an extension of the Office of 
the High Representative's (OHR) mandate, and the reform 
agenda.  He noted, however, that Russia continued to lobby 
against the quint proposal, and in favor of limiting the 
extension to only six months. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Clerx commented that the reform agenda laid out in 
our nonpaper was in line with French priorities for BiH.  He 
highlighted police and constitutional reform as France's two 
top concerns.
