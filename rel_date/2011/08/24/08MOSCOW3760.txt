¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Russian Federal Veterinary 
and Phytosanitary Surveillance Service (VPSS) 
raised the bar in requesting a list of U.S. 
fodder exporters to Russia in its December 26, 
2008, letter by threatening to ban U.S. fodder 
exports if a list is not produced by January 1, 
¶2009.  The original scanned copy of the VPSS 
letter and courtesy translation were sent to USDA 
on December 29, 2008.  An informal embassy 
translation of the letter follows.  END SUMMARY.

Moscow, December 26, 2008 
No. FS-NV-2/13281 
 
Dr. Robert Tanaka, 
Area Director for Eastern Europe, USDA-APHIS 
 
 
Dear Dr. Tanaka, 
 
The Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary 
Surveillance Service (VPSS) extends its regards 
to the Animal and Plant Inspection Service 
(APHIS), USDA in the EU, and informs you of the 
following. 
 
By its letters #FS-AS-2/11553 of November 14, 
2008, and FS-NV-2/12384 dated December 5, 2008, 
VPSS informed about the necessity for providing 
lists of the U.S. processing fodder and fodder 
additives facilities that previously exported 
their products to the Russian Federation and 
currently have contracts with the Russian 
partners for shipping such products, and as well 
as guarantees that these facilities are under 
permanent control of the U.S. veterinary service 
and that they will fulfill in the full scale 
Russian veterinary-sanitary requirements and 
norms. 
 
However, to date the U.S. side has not 
provided to VPSS the above mentioned lists of the 
U.S. establishments. This circumstance will 
create a serious barrier to trade of fodder 
between our countries since VPSS will not be able 
to issue import permits for shipments of fodder 
for 2009 from the U.S. to the Russian Federation 
until the mentioned materials have been provided. 
 
Please accept, Mr. Tanaka, assurances of my deep 
respect for you. 
 
 
Deputy Head 
Vlasov

¶3. (SBU) Comment. Since November, VPSS has been 
aggressive in demanding lists for both fish and 
fodder.  In the case of fish, the United States 
explained that it does not maintain exporter 
lists but agreed to verify a list provided by the 
Russians.  This action, coupled with an 
invitation to inspect U.S. fish facilities 
averted a ban on U.S. fish. USDA may want to 
consider a similar approach and offer to verify 
a Russian list contingent on a method for adding 
additional exporters to such a list.  VPSS maintains that 
the list approach is necessary to control 
fraudulent export certification. End Comment.
