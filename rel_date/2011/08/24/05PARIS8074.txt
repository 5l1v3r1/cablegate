(U)  Embassy received an email version of the response to 
Embassy Letter dated 17 November concerning Reftel A. 
Informal translation: 
 
"The Embassy of the United States in Paris has requested 
that the US Air Force Mission that will go to the Marquesas 
Islands on 1 - 15 December 2005 to install a telemetry 
station for the launch of a meteorological satellite, be 
exempted from paying the (customs) security deposit.  As an 
answer to this request, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
informs the Embassy of the United States that the government 
of French Polynesia has agreed to waive the deposit request 
for the import under the temporary admission regime of the 
telemetry equipment. This authorization has been delivered 
on an exceptional basis, taking into account the overall 
interest of the project and as well as the good relationship 
between the Polynesian government and U.S. Authorities." 
(Note forwarded by The Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Office 
of Americas and Caribbean Affairs.)
