¶1. (SBU) On May 11-14, 2009, post delivered talking points 
contained in reftel to officials at the Ministry of Economic 
Cooperation and Development (BMZ), Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA), and Ministry of Finance.  Friedrika Kaercher, 
Desk Officer for Serbia and Kosovo, BMZ, confirmed strong 
German support for Kosovo's membership in the World Bank, 
explaining that Germany is conducting a similar worldwide 
demarche to build support for a positive outcome.  Having 
recently returned from Pristina, Kaercher reported that 
Kosovo's Finance Minister Ahmet Shala had been elated by 
Kosovo's recent success in joining the International Monetary 
Fund; Shala hoped Kosovo would have the same result at the 
World Bank.  (NOTE: Germany's Governor for the World Bank is 
the Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), 
Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul; the alternate is Finance Ministry 
State Secretary Joerg Asmussen.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Marc Bogdahn, Deputy Head of Division, Western 
Balkans, Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), likewise 
confirmed German support for Kosovo's membership in the World 
Bank.  He noted that Germany was already conducting demarches 
to that effect worldwide, but did not commit to a joint 
demarche with the United States.  (COMMENT: The MFA as a rule 
prefers to deliver demarches on its own, but often 
acknowledges joint positions with other countries in so 
doing. END COMMENT.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reftel points were also shared with Ministry of 
Finance contacts, who acknowledged German support for 
Kosovo's World Bank membership.
