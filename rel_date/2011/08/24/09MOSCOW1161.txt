¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Russian Federal Veterinary 
and Phytosanitary Surveillance Service (VPSS) 
advised via official letter that restrictions 
placed on all pork and pork products from 10 U.S. 
states, using influenza A H1N1 as justification, 
have been lifted effective immediately (REF A). 
As of today, California, New York, Texas, South 
Carolina and (most recently) Delaware are 
restricted from exporting all types of 
fresh/frozen meat and poultry products to Russia. 
In addition, temporarily restricts are still in 
place on all fresh/frozen pork and pork products 
from Arizona and Massachusetts. The original 
scanned copy of the letter and courtesy 
translation were sent to FAS/APHIS on May 5, 2009 
(REF B).  An informal embassy translation of the 
letter follows. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT: 
Moscow, May 5, 2009 
FS-NV-2/4231 
 
Regional Director 
USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) In the European Union 
Mr. Jay Mitchell 
 
Due to the improving epizootic/epidemiological 
situation in some U.S. states, VPSS has lifted 
all restrictions on meat products from Indiana, 
Kansas, Michigan, Nevada, and Ohio.  Effective 
immediately, all meat and poultry products are 
allowed for export from these states without 
restrictions related to the spread of 
A/H1N1/California/04/2009 influenza. 
 
The situation in the states Arizona and South 
Carolina is still not clear enough for us to 
remove restrictions.  Questions about their 
status will be resolved soon as relevant 
information continues to be provided to my office 
by USDA. 
 
The situation regarding the spread of 
A/H1N1/California/04/2009 influenza is changing 
quickly.  During the last few days, temporary 
restrictions were imposed on meat and/or poultry 
products from the several U.S. states for export 
to Russia.  Restrictions on some of these states 
have already been lifted while new ones have been 
placed.  Therefore, in order to simplify the work 
of officials and legal entities of the United 
States and Russia, and with approval from the AGR 
office of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, we send to 
you a spreadsheet that reflects the current 
status regarding prohibitions imposed in relation 
to the spread of the virus (not included in 
cable). 
 
We remind you that states in Zone 1 (currently 
California, New York, Texas, Delaware and South 
Carolina) are prohibited from exporting all types 
of fresh/frozen meat and poultry products as well 
as from exporting all processed meat and poultry 
products that have not been heat-treated at a 
minimum temperature of 80 degrees Celsius during 
not less then 30 minutes. 
 
The states in Zone 2 (currently Arizona and 
Massachusetts) are prohibited from exporting all 
fresh and frozen pork and pork products as well 
as all processed pork products that have not been 
heat-treated at a minimum temperature of 80 
 
degrees Celsius for at least 30 minutes. 
 
No restrictions related to spreading the 
A/H1N1/California/04/2009 influenza are imposed 
on the states located in Zone 3. 
 
All meat and poultry products from unrestricted 
states can transit via Zones 1 and 2 for loading 
at ports.  Cold storages in Zones 1 and 2 can 
also be used as long as the meat and poultry came 
from non-restricted states. 
 
Mr. Mitchell, let me assure you of my highest 
esteem. 
 
N.A. Vlasov 
Deputy Head

¶3. (SBU) VPSS has begun easing trade restrictions 
on U.S. meat and poultry exports thanks, in large 
part, to the frequent updates provided by USDA 
Washington.  Other countries are not so lucky. 
Russia announced recently that all pork and pork 
products (as well as live pigs) have been 
restricted from Spain, Great Britain and several 
provinces in Canada.  In addition, VPSS 
restricted all meat and poultry products from 
Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Dominican Republic, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama, 
and El Salvador as of April 26.  VPSS officials 
have stated that more bans were possible and that 
they could be applied to entire countries or 
regions, depending on the velocity with which 
they divulge information about the discovery and 
the spread of the virus.
