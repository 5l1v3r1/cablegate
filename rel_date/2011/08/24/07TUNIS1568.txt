SUBJECT: TUNISIA: WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR INFORMATION 
 
REF: STATE 149662 
 
(SBU) In 2007, there were no significant changes in 
Government of Tunisia efforts to combat the worst forms of 
child labor.  The information on Tunisia in the Department of 
Labor's 2006 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor 
remains accurate, to the best of Post's knowledge.  The 
Government of Tunisia did not respond to Post's request for 
information about recent efforts.  Local and international 
NGOs report that official statistics on child labor are not 
publicly available and these NGOs are not aware of specific 
government efforts to combat child labor in 2007.
