 ¶1. (U) Summary.  On November 14, the DCM along with various 
sections of the Embassy hosted an interagency group of key 
representatives from Spain's civil aviation security sector. 
The DCM expressed the Embassy's appreciation for GOS security 
efforts and pledged to continue and increase dialogue and 
coordination.  The event received favorable reviews from our 
GOS contacts who appreciated the opportunity to interact with 
individuals from several Embassy sections and speak candidly 
in an informal setting.  All participants indicated a 
willingness and interest in repeating this event on an annual 
or semi-annual basis.  The meeting was particularly relevant 
given increasing numbers of passengers and flights to and 
through Spain.  End Summary.

Overtures for Increased Dialogue 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On November 14, the DCM hosted an interagency civil 
aviation security meet and greet, bringing together various 
Embassy sections and representatives from Spain's civil 
aviation sector to dialogue on security efforts.  Attendees 
included officials from: (a) airport-assigned national police 
responsible for immigration as well as security on the public 
side, (b) the Guardia Civil responsible for security 
checkpoints, baggage screening, and security on the air side, 
(c) the Ministry of Infrastructure's civil aviation security 
directorate which is responsible for policy matters, (d) 
Spanish Airports and Navigation (AENA) which is Spain's 
airport and air navigation services operator, and (e) airline 
officials.  The DCM expressed Embassy appreciation for the 
contributions of each organization towards international 
security efforts and pledged continued support and dialogue 
from the Embassy. 
 
¶3. (U) Topics of discussion ranged greatly and included 
discussion of the increasing levels of 
drug-trafficking-related arrests at Spanish airports, efforts 
to implement biometric and facial recognition technology, and 
increasing passenger and flight volume.  A representative 
from AENA said that airports in Spain were experiencing large 
passenger volumes, particularly in their transit traffic, and 
that AENA projections predicted continued and significant 
volume increases.  (Note: the recent construction of two new 
runways and a new terminal at Madrid Barajas will help 
solidify Madrid's position as a transit destination.  End 
Note.) 
 
¶4. (U) Representatives from the Guardia Civil commented that 
drug trafficking arrests had increased greatly over the past 
year and that they were detecting large amounts of narcotics 
transiting Spain from Colombia and the Dominican Republic to 
the increasingly popular destination of China.  Continuing 
the theme of law enforcement, an AENA representative added 
that in an effort to support its law enforcement colleagues, 
AENA was in the process of installing biometric and facial 
recognition technology at Spanish airports.  Given the recent 
turnover of several positions at the airport, not all present 
were aware of this proposal.  This part of the dialogue was 
one example the value of the event for our Spanish 
colleagues, whom stayed after the event broke up to exchange 
business cards and talk amongst themselves.

Increasing Relevance of Spain in Civil Aviation 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶5. (U) Spain's relevance to the U.S. in civil aviation 
continues to increase.  As a leading tourist destination and 
transit point, Spain received close to 200 million passengers 
in 2006 (a 6.6 percent increase from 2005).  Preliminary 2007 
statistics suggest that this amount will increase by over 8 
percent this year.  The past year was marked by an expansion 
of flights between the U.S. and Spain by Iberia and American 
Airlines, bringing the total number of carriers flying 
between the U.S. and Spain to 5 for an average of 13 flights 
a day. 
 
¶6. (U) Airports Council International ranks the Madrid 
Barajas airport in 2006 as 13th in the world for passenger 
traffic and 18th in the world for aircraft movements overall. 
 With the expansion of Madrid Barajas and Barcelona El Prat 
airports, Spain will continue to augment its capacity and its 
position as a top international destination and tourist hub.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (U) With increasing U.S.-Spanish civil aviation links and 
an ever-existing terrorism threat, this event was an 
excellent opportunity to demonstrate the mission's support 
for the security work that these agencies undertake as well 
as to clarify the roles of various sections of the Embassy 
working on security and/or civil aviation issues.  We 
received positive feedback from our counterparts on this 
event and will continue to build on these efforts.
