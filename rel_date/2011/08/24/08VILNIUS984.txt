REF: SECSTATE 123081 
 
Post raised reftel points November 24 with Julius Rakitskis, 
head of MFA's human-rights division.  He said recent 
discussions indicated that Lithuania probably would again 
abstain on the resolutions reaffirming the existence of three 
UN bodies dealing with Palestinians.  The final decision, 
however, has yet to be made and he said our arguments would 
be considered.
