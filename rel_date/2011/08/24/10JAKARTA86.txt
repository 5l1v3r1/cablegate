¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The President's vision of a "New Beginning" with 
the Muslim world is alive and well in Indonesia.  This new era of 
global engagement has allowed us to make significant advances to our 
Comprehensive Partnership with Indonesia--the Muslim world's largest 
democracy.  When President Obama and President Yudhoyono met last 
November, they pledged to strengthen the U.S.-Indonesia 
Comprehensive Partnership in key areas such as interfaith dialogue, 
democracy and economic reform, science and technology, 
entrepreneurship, people to people ties, climate change, and health; 
a perfect match with the President's global engagement effort.  END 
SUMMARY. 
INTERFAITH DIALOGUE 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On January 25-27, we will engage in the first bilateral 
interfaith working group event under the Cairo Initiative at the 
request of the Government of Indonesia.  The event will focus on 
building communities through interfaith work as a component of the 
Comprehensive Partnership.  Former Foreign Minister Wirajuda 
proposed this dialogue to Secretary Clinton when she visited Jakarta 
last year.  We expect this event will serve as a model for similar 
dialogues throughout the Muslim world.  It will bring leaders from 
the private, civil and government sectors together to create 
actionable plans for addressing common challenges. 
 
PROMOTING DEMOCRACY IN THE REGION 
 
¶4.  (SBU) U/S Burns attended the second Bali Democracy Forum (BDF) 
held last December in Indonesia.  The forum was created by the 
Indonesian government so that Indonesia could play a greater 
leadership role in the region by promoting regional democratization. 
 The BDF was attended by representatives from 36 Asian countries and 
13 observer nations.  We are working with the BDF's programming arm, 
the Institute for Peace and Democracy, to provide training, election 
visits, policy-oriented research and field studies to advance the 
democratic process throughout Asia. 
 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Science Envoy Dr. Bruce Alberts unfortunately had to 
cancel his visit to Indonesia in late January.  But he already plans 
to continue discussions and exploration of areas of science 
partnership including application of science discoveries, science 
education and increasing institutional science linkages between both 
countries.  We hope to finalize a Science and Technology Agreement 
before President Obama's expected visit to pave the way for deeper 
scientific exchanges.  The Embassy has organized a series of events 
in coordination with the Indonesian government and private sector 
companies to address food security and provide opportunities for 
U.S. companies in biotechnology.  Mission has promoted the concept 
of a Center for Sustainable Ocean Fisheries to encourage fisheries 
research, fisheries management, and monitoring. 
 
ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
 
¶6.  (SBU) We have an opportunity to partner with Indonesia on 
entrepreneurship.  Indonesia is enthusiastic to cooperate; 
government officials and business leaders have already expressed 
interest in hosting a follow-on event in Indonesia to President 
Obama's Entrepreneurship Summit in Washington.  Cooperation in 
entrepreneurship also provides a positive framework to address 
economic and investment climate reform issues and highlights our 
links to fast-growing Asian markets critical for U.S. growth. 
Increased investment in entrepreneurship in Indonesia holds 
potential for significant gains. 
 
PEOPLE TO PEOPLE TIES 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Plans to construct a high-tech, 21st century public 
diplomacy venue targeting Indonesian youth continue.  Using a "whole 
of government" approach, we will take public diplomacy outside the 
embassy to a popular shopping mall to connect at "The American 
Place."  This venue will have dynamic, regularly changing 
programming, involving public and private partners to provide a 
uniquely American experience. 
 
EDUCATION 
 
¶8.  (SBU) We are strengthening higher education cooperation by 
 
JAKARTA 00000086  002 OF 002 
 
 
working to double the number of Indonesian students in the U.S. and 
U.S. students in Indonesia.  We also are working to increase 
university-to-university partnerships and expand exchange programs, 
such as Fulbright, English immersion and community college programs. 
Using USAID funds, we are creating university linkages between U.S. 
and Indonesian universities to partner on child protection and 
biodiversity research. 
 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Indonesia continues to play a positive role in 
international climate change talks and is associating itself with 
the Copenhagen Accord.  It will likely be one of the first countries 
to inscribe its domestic actions with the U.N. Framework Convention 
on Climate Change Secretariat prior to the UN deadline, and it is 
taking a leadership role in encouraging other countries to inscribe 
as well. 
 
HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS 
 
¶10.  (SBU) President Obama and President Yudhoyono called for 
deepening U.S.-Indonesia cooperation in combating infectious 
diseases when they met in November in Singapore.   Health 
cooperation is an important part of the U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive 
Partnership and a critical priority for both countries.  The 
establishment of the Indonesia-U.S. Center for Biomedical and Public 
Health Research (IUC) would provide an ideal platform for long-term 
engagement on infectious disease research and applied public health 
solutions that will benefit both countries.  To do that, however, we 
must be able to assuage Indonesian political sensitivities over U.S. 
military involvement.
