SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (08/25): Prime Minister lays out a 
plan for achieving an independent state 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with news on Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's meeting with US Special Envoy George 
Mitchell in London scheduled for August 26. While reports quote US 
State Department Spokesman Ian Kelly stating that the US hopes to 
see the Palestinians and Israelis resume peace talks as soon as 
possible, Israeli officials are reportedly skeptical that the 
meeting will achieve major progress in bridging the gaps between the 
US and Israel concerning settlement activity. Palestinian Authority 
(PA) Presidency spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeinah is quoted in 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida as saying that "anything that doesn't comply with 
road map obligations or President Obama's demands will not lead to 
renewed peace talks." The dailies also report on an expected 
trilateral meeting between Netanyahu, PA President Mahmoud Abbas and 
President Barack Obama in early September in New York. 
 
All dailies report that PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad will hold a 
press conference today to announce his plan for building Palestinian 
institutions and establishing an independent Palestinian state in 
two years. Fayyad is quoted in Al-Ayyam as saying "the Palestinians 
must not wait for a peace settlement with Israel. They must move 
forward and build their state." 
 
Al-Quds front pages news on the Chairman of the Palestinian National 
Council (PNC) Salim Al-Zaanoun noting on August 24 that an 
extraordinary session of the PNC will be held in Ramallah on August 
26 in order to complete the membership of the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page news on the PA Ministry of 
Education condemning Hamas for imposing a special uniform on school 
girls in Gaza. PA Deputy Minister of Education Mohammad Abu Zaid is 
reported as saying that this policy is against the right to an 
education and other universal human rights. Abu Zaid urged Hamas not 
to bring the schools and educational institutions into the political 
conflict. Al-Ayyam reports that the Hamas government in Gaza 
expressed its anger at the media for highlighting these new measures 
and noted that it will pursue this policy notwithstanding any 
criticism. ------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Wadi Abu Nassar opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title, "Will there be a settlement construction freeze?" (08/25): 
"Most likely the freezing of settlements in the West Bank and 
Jerusalem will not be complete. Without a courageous Israeli 
leadership, strong pressure on the Israeli government, and without 
ending the occupation, the settlements in the West Bank will not 
stop." 
 
2) Hafeth Al-Barghouti opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily 
under the title "Hamas and the dialogue" (08/25): "Since the 
beginning of the first round of the national unity dialogue, Hamas 
has not changed its position, and it imposed new demands and 
conditions at every round of talks that are totally irrelevant to 
the dialogue ... It is clear that Hamas is not interested in 
achieving any tangible results from this dialogue. It only wants to 
gain time and avoid elections."
