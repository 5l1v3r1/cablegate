OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL / ZAMAN: Ozgur Gundem and Evrensel 
dailies carried on their front-cover the military personnel's 
recent protest against the Hakkari Municipality for "being 
indifferent to the garbage collecting duty and engaging itself 
in efforts to divide the country."  According to the dailies, 
Hakkari people did not give credit to the protest event.  Legal 
experts allegedly claimed that military personnel are not 
allowed to demonstrate against public institutions and that 
investigation must be started against them.  Meanwhile, Deputy 
Mayor of Hakkari Municipality claimed that some of the civilian 
demonstrators were actually soldiers from a brigade located 
seven kilometers away from the city. 
 
¶3.      EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM: Ahead of tomorrow's court hearing 
in Eskisehir on the case of Ahmet and Ugur Kaymaz, the father 
and his son, who were allegedly executed by security officers on 
November 21, 2004 in Mardin's Kiziltepe district, the daily 
published for the first time photos that showed dead bodies of 
Ahmet and Ugur Kaymaz lying on the ground at the site of the 
event reportedly two hours after the incident. 
 
¶4.      ZAMAN / YENI SAFAK / RADIKAL / EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM / 
CUMHURIYET: Iraqi President Jalal Talabani reportedly claimed 
that Iraq has convinced the PKK to lay down arms.  PKK will 
allegedly implement a ceasefire in the coming days, according to 
Talabani. Talabani also expressed a strong desire for the U.S. 
soldiers to stay in the country for a long time and for the 
construction of permanent U.S. air bases in Iraq. 
 
¶5.      ZAMAN / RADIKAL: The draft constitution the Kurdish 
Authority in the northern Iraq prepared, which has been 
presented to the regional parliament in Arbil province, 
reportedly includes clauses which prevent returning of the PKK

described the PKK as a mere pawn. 
 
¶8.      YENI SAFAK / OZGUR GUNDEM: Diyarbakir Prosecutor's Office
