Â¶1.  (SBU) This message responds to reftel request for views 
on the French services market with input from Embassy ECON, 
FCS and Ag sections.  Following is a ranking of services 
sectors in France.  The estimates cited below are intended as 
a broad and very general gauge of market potentials and 
market access conditions.  As requested reftel, we have 
ranked sectors with a numerical value and a high, medium or 
low ranking.  The numerical value reflects our assessment of 
the priority U.S. service providers do/would assign (1 = top 
priority; 5 = low priority for U.S. service providers).  The 
high, medium or low verbal ranking reflects our assessment of 
how open the French market is in each sector.  An openness 
ranking of "high" means that we have not been made aware of 
particular complaints regarding market openness.  A "medium" 
or "low" ranking indicates that we are aware of a desire for 
some degree of improvement in market openness.
