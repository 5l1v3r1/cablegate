U.S. Arms Sale to Taiwan 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. At the January 26 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu stated that China was "firmly 
against" U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.  China had made many 
representations to the U.S. on the issue in the past and its 
opposition remained "consistent, unequivocal, and firm."  Ma urged 
the United States to respect the three Joint Communiques, especially 
the principles in the August 17, 1982 Joint Communique.  Ma said 
that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan could impair the U.S.-China 
relationship. 
 
¶3. Overall, the U.S.-China relationship over the past year had been 
stable, Ma said.  Both sides shouldQrish this "hard-won 
achievement" and urged the U.S. to continue to promote the 
fundamental interests of both countries by adhering to the three 
Joint Communiques and the Joint Statement released during the 
November, 2009 visit to China by President Obama. 
 
Dalai Lama's Special Envoy Visit to China 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. In response to questions regarding the announced visit to China 
by representatives of the Dalai Lama, Ma stated that Chinese 
officials would meet with the representatives at the request of the 
Dalai Lama.  China hoped the Dalai Lama would "cherish the 
opportunity" presented by the consultations with the Chinese 
government. 
 
China's Internet 
---------------- 
 
¶5. Ma asserted that China enjoyed extensive freedom of expression. 
He noted that since the political turmoil of the late 1980s, the 
Chinese people have chosen the path of "correct development." 
 
¶6. Internet security was a global problem and the Chinese government 
opposed any form of cyber attack, Ma stated.  He noted that the 
Chinese government's position was unequivocal in supporting 
international cooperation against hacking and in ensuring the 
protection of its citizens. 
 
China's Earthquake Disaster Relief in HaiQ 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. Ma announced that China's efforts to provide disaster relief and 
assistance for reconstruction efforts in Haiti would respect Haiti's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity.  China had provided 38 
million USD in in-kind and financial assistance for disaster relief 
efforts, Ma said.  He noted that China's experience in responding to 
the Sichuan earthquake would help Chinese efforts to rebuild Haiti 
alongside the international community. 
 
¶8. Chinese consular officials had helped Chinese citizens stranded 
in Haiti to return to China on a charter plane, Ma announced. 
 
Whereabouts of Gao Zhisheng 
--------------------------- 
 
¶9. In response to a question regarding the location of human rights 
advocate Gao Zhisheng, Ma replied that he had no information on 
Gao's current location.  He noted that there were 1.3 billion people 
in China and the Chinese government did not know where specific 
individuals would be located at all times. 
 
Way Ahead on Copenhagen Agreement 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶10. Ma stated the Chinese government supported the agreements 
concluded during the Copenhagen Conference on Climate Change because 
they reflected the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCC) principle of "common but differentiated 
 
BEIJING 00000209  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
responsibilities."  The next step would be to translate the 
consensus reached at the Conference into specific tasks and to hold 
working level meetings as early as possible.  He concluded that 
China would affirm emission mitigation and reduction agreements 
reached in Copenhagen. 
 
Response to Iran's Nuclear Program 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶11. Ma stated that China's approach to Iran's nuclear program was 
consistent and emphasized dialogue and cooperation.  There was 
"still room for diplomatic efforts," said Ma, and China would 
emphasize flexibility and pragmatism in these efforts. 
 
Kidnapped Chinese Engineers in Afghanistan 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶12. Ma stated that China was making every effort to rescue two 
Chinese engineers who had been kidnapped in Afghanistan January 16.
