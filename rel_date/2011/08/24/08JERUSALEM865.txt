¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  PA security forces (PASF) continue 
patrols in Jenin area villages as of 1400 local on May 20. 
PA security commanders plan new patrols and raids across the 
Jenin Governorate in coming days.  PIJ suspects remain in 
custody, but have not been formally charged.  End summary. 
 
PASF Patrols Continue Apace, 
No Plans to End Operation Yet 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) National Security Forces (NSF) and police 
commanders report that PASF are continuing patrols and raids 
in Jenin Governorate, entering Yabad (Area B, west of Jenin) 
and smaller nearby villages early May 20.  According to West 
Bank NSF commander MG Thiab Ali (Abu al-Fatah) and police 
contacts, nearly all PASF who deployed to Jenin on May 2 
remain there.  Beyond those forces regularly stationed in 
Jenin, there are 120 NSF and 279 PG soldiers, 65 public order 
police and 30 deployed intelligence officers from Preventive 
Security (PSO), General Intelligence, "Military Intelligence" 
(Istikhbarat) and "Military Police."  200 additional PG 
soldiers who deployed after clashes with PIJ in Qabatiya on 
May 6 (Refs B and C) have redeployed to Bethlehem to protect 
the Palestine Investment Conference, after MG Ali and Jenin 
NSF commander BG Sulayman Imran assessed that the situation 
had calmed and they were no longer needed. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) NSF and police contacts compiled a statistical 
roll-up of accomplishments from May 3-20: 
 -- PASF seized and dismantled/sold off 449 stolen vehicles 
(stolen vehicles are generally already at least partially 
disassembled for parts when seized), and confiscated 84 
unregistered vehicles; 
 -- PASF served 162 court summons, mostly to criminal 
defendants in B Areas; 
 -- Court officials and police report closing 1,348 criminal 
and civil enforcement cases (this figure includes everything 
from felony cases to minor offenses such as traffic 
infractions, most of which were expeditiously resolved with 
impositions of fines or probation). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) PA security commanders plan additional patrols in 
the greater Jenin area in coming days, including in villages 
the PA has already visited.  MG Ali said he wants residents, 
and especially those in smaller towns that PA security has 
not visited since 2000, to understand that the Jenin security 
operation is not a one-time "show," but rather the beginning 
of a sustained commitment to law and order. 
 
PIJ Militants in Custody 
------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) PA security commanders report that eight PIJ 
members are in PA custody in Jenin as of 1200 local on May 
20, all of whom have requested inclusion in the PA-GOI 
disarmament/amnesty deal.  Two are minor PIJ supporters from 
the Khzaymiah family who remain under PA guard in Jenin's 
hospital (shot in the feet while attempting to force police 
to free a jailed PIJ militant), and the other six are: 
a) Umar al-Bzur, arrested April 28; 
b) Salih Abu Zayyad (al-Quds Brigades cell leader), arrested 
May 11; 
c) Ala'a Abu Rub, arrested May 12 
d) Yusif Kmayl, arrested May 12 
e) Abd al-Fatah Khzaymiah, in General Intelligence protective 
custody since May 18; and 
f) Jihad Nawadha, arrested May 16.
