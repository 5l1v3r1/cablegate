¶1.   Harare is pleased to report that the November 14 
    edition of the government-controlled daily "The Herald" 
    carried the full text of Secretary Powell's byliner on Iraq 
    (Washington File story AEF20012 of 11/12/2002). 
 
¶2.   The article got prominent play as the lead opinion 
    piece on the op-ed page, published under the title "We do 
    not seek war with Iraq - Powell."  Photographs of President 
    Bush, Secretary Powell and Saddam Hussein accompanied the 
    article. 
 
¶3.   Comment:  Given the current state of US-Zimbabwean 
    relations, and the "Herald's" customary hostility to US 
    policy, this placement is a significant one.  We do not 
    believe it signals a change in the "Herald's" editorial 
    policy, but are nonetheless pleased that they chose to air 
    our side of the story on Iraq.  This placement also 
    underscores the power of high-profile byliners.  End 
    comment.
