SUBJECT: INDONESIA - WORLD HEALTH ASSEMBLY DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 61739 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: We delivered reftel demarche to the Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) on May 9 and the National Institute of 
Health Research and Development (NIHRD) on May 10.  Siuaji Raja, 
Deputy Director for Socio Cultural Affairs and International 
Organizations at DEPLU, told us that the Government of Indonesia 
(GOI) would likely raise Indonesia's concerns on the sample sharing 
issue at the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an initial step, with 
the possibility of introducing the issues again at the United 
Nations (UN).  NIHRD Director Dr. Triono Soendoro told us that 
Minister of Health Fadilah Supari has requested ten minutes of 
speaking time during the WHA opening session to explain Indonesia's 
position and dispel "inaccurate press reporting."  Triono also 
requested a meeting between the GOI delegation to the WHA and key 
U.S. policymakers, and expressed concern about the media's coverage 
of the sample sharing issue. End Summary. 
 
DEPLU Demarche 
-------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response to our demarche, Raja told us that the Minister 
of Health recently created a new position within her ministry to 
oversee global health and foreign policy (GHFP).  He stated that 
Indonesia is one of eight nations in an informal GHFP working group. 
 Raja noted that the Minister appointed a senior Ministry of Health 
official to oversee this office and represent these concerns at the 
WHA, and that Indonesia believes health issues are foreign policy 
issues.  He said the GOI may raise its GHFP concerns at the UN. 
 
Ministry of Health NIHRD Demarche 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) During our May 10 meeting, Triono said he understood the 
U.S. position and requested to meet "behind the scenes," without the 
media present, with Secretary Leavitt or key US policy maker(s).  He 
noted that a possible meeting before or on the sides of the WHA 
would help "avoid misunderstandings."  If both sides cannot meet 
during the WHA, Triono said he hoped to arrange a meeting at a later 
date.  Triono added that he understood the formal nature of the 
demarche, but said "there is always room to discuss." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Triono also claimed that the media has continually 
misquoted the Ministry of Health in its coverage of the sample 
sharing issue.  He explained that this was one of the reasons the 
Minister had requested ten minutes of speaking time early during the 
WHA to present Indonesia's position and "dispel misunderstandings." 
He further stated that he would not meet with the media regarding 
sample sharing until after the WHA.  Triono added that the smallpox 
issue comes up every year and would not likely be a point of 
contention.
