REF: BAGHDAD 3460 
 
¶1. (SBU) Iraq's consumer price index (CPI) increased 15.1% in 
August, and the year-on-year increase reached 76.6%. The 
increase is largely driven by rising prices in the categories 
of Fuel/electricity (57.8%) and Transport/communication 
(20.8%). GOI's Central Office of Statistics and Information 
Technology (COSIT) lists disaggregated percentage increases 
(month-on-month) as follows: 
 
Food                       6.1% 
Tobacco/liquor             0.1% 
Clothing/shoes             1.5% 
Furniture                  0.8% 
Fuel/electricity          57.8% 
Transport/communications  20.8% 
Medical services/medicine  7.0% 
Misc. goods/services       3.3% 
Rent                       0.7% 
 
Compared to the data from August 2005, prices grew at the 
following rates: 
 
Food                      39.7% 
Tobacco/liquor            12.8% 
Clothing/shoes            26.7% 
Furniture                 14.2% 
Fuel/electricity         321.8% 
Transport/communications 235.8% 
Medical services/medicine 22.6% 
Misc. goods/services      37.5% 
Rent                      34.7% 
 
¶2. (SBU) COSIT describes its CPI data as an imperfect measure 
of inflation. Given data collection limitations and an 
outdated basket of goods, real inflation is likely higher 
than the COSIT estimates (reftel).
