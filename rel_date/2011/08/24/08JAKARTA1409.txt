REF: A) JAKARTA 01336  B) JAKARTA 01257 
 
¶1. (SBU) Andy Rachmianto at the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DEPLU) plans to host an interagency meeting in mid-August, with the 
Ministries of Health, Research and Technology, and Agriculture to 
identify any difficulties to approving the Biosecurity Engagement 
Program (BEP) MOU originally scheduled to be signed 26 June.  (REF 
A)  Rachmianto recommended that BEP hold off on sending large 
equipment intended for its partner institutions since the MOU 
primarily provides a tax exemption for equipment and other large 
purchases. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rachmianto suggested that Foreign Minister Wirajuda himself 
postponed the MOU signing after the BEP MOU was brought up during 
the 25 June hearing on NAMRU-2. (REF B)  Rachmianto expressed 
disbelief that copies of the MOU had been circulated around 
Parliament.
