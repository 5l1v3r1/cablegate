REF: A. SECSTATE 116263 
     ¶B. NEW DELHI 02176 
 
¶1. (U) PolCouns conveyed Ref A demarche on November 12 and 13 
to Ministry of External Affairs Joint Secretaries for 
Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran (PAI) Division, Y.K. Sinha, and UN 
Economic and for Social (UNES) Division, Rajiv Misra, 
respectively.  Emphasizing the importance we place on the 
Indian Government's support for the UNGA resolutions on Iran, 
Burma, and North Korea, we urged the Joint Secretaries to 
instruct the Indian Mission in New York to vote against or 
abstain on any "no-action" motions which may arise.  We also 
conveyed our hopes that India would reconsider its policy of 
opposition to country-specific resolutions and endorse all 
three resolutions when they came to a vote. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Post is doubtful New Delhi will be 
persuaded to change its stance on the issue of 
country-specific resolutions during the 64th session of UNGA. 
 As MEA/UNES Under Secretary Abhishek Verma told PolOff on 
October 23 (Ref B), the Indian Government believes that 
"country-specific resolutions lead to finger pointing and 
intensive monitoring... and India will probably abstain from 
voting on Burma and DPRK Human Rights resolutions."  Despite 
Verma's reassurance that the GOI would formulate a decision 
regarding Iran at the highest levels, if voting records are 
an accurate indicator, India is unlikely to support the 
Canadian-sponsored resolution.  End Comment.
