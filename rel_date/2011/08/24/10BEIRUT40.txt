REF: A. 09 STATE 130760 
     ¶B. 09 BEIRUT 116 
 
¶1.  The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has 
an authorized strength of 15,000 troops with current 
troop strength at just over 12,500.  In response to ref A, we 
found no public or media reports concerning trafficking in 
persons (TIP) or sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) 
involving UNIFIL personnel, and UNIFIL officials reported 
there were no allegations filed against UNIFIL personnel in 
¶2009.  In addition, an official from the Lebanese office of 
Human 
Rights Watch (HRW) reported to that HRW had no information on 
any TIP or SEA incidents involving UNIFIL personnel. 
 
¶2.  UNIFIL staff officers continue to receive training in 
international humanitarian law, provided by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to help prevent SEA. 
Military staff officers and civilian staff also receive a 
briefing on UN standards of conduct that focuses on SEA and 
the requirement to uphold international humanitarian law. 
 
¶3.  Since March 2009, the Regional Conduct and Discipline 
Team (RCDT) based in UNIFIL has been carrying out two 
training activities for UNIFIL military personnel.  First, 
all contingent/unit commanders are briefed on UN rules 
and regulations as well as UNIFIL-specific standards of 
conduct to ensure that they are fully aware of their 
leadership obligations to uphold and maintain the expected 
standards of conduct, including the prohibitions on SEA. 
Second, the RCDT also conducts a train-the-trainers seminar 
for contingents and military units at the earliest 
opportunity, typically within their first month of arrival. 
Following the training, the trainers then train the troops on 
topics including SEA, the requirement to uphold international 
humanitarian law, and the responsibility and avenues for 
reporting misconduct. 
 
¶4.  The Embassy contacted the UNIFIL Office of Political 
Affairs, Human Rights Watch, and the International Catholic 
Migration Commission to compile the data for this report. 
Point of contact for this report is Joshua W. Polacheck.
