All media outlets gave top billing to the Arab Summit in Doha.  A 
number of outlets characterized the summit as a success, 
particularly since it ended with the Libyan-Saudi reconciliation. 
Other outlets observed that, except for the Libyan-Saudi 
reconciliation and the attendance of the Sudanese President, the 
summit "was only a repetition of other summits."  One newspaper 
commented sarcastically that Arab summits have changed into "social 
gatherings" where real Arab causes are "lost."

"The Ceiling of the Arab Summit is Managing Differences," an 
editorial by Rafiq Khoury in Centrist Al-Anwar (3/31): 
 
"The Doha Summit was not...different from other Arab summits. 
...Each summit carries a majestic slogan which is far away from the 
difficult reality...and during each summit there are surprises. 
This summit witnessed several surprises:  the absence of the 
Egyptian President, ...the attendance of the Sudanese 
President,...and the Libyan-Saudi reconciliation.  ...All of the 
above, however, should not be the core of the summit.  Arabs are 
facing many challenges that are in need of a united strategic vision 
in order to confront the Zionist projects and other...regional 
projects that are based on Arab weaknesses.  ...The most important 
development in this particular summit is moving from conflicts to 
the phase of acknowledging these conflicts and trying to do 
something about them.  ...The road ahead is long, but today is 
better than yesterday and we hope that tomorrow will witness a new 
development of quality." 
 
"Summits and Reconciliations," an unsigned editorial in independent 
Al-Diyar (3/31): 
 
"Reconciliations have become the reason for holding Arab summits. 
Attendance of summits have become a factor by which we measure the 
success of these summits.  The real causes, problems, and challenges 
of the Arab nation are getting lost in the middle of all this 
superficiality... Arab summits have merely become social 
gatherings..."
