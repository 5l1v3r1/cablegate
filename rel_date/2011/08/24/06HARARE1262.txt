SUBJECT: MDC SUSPENDS TROUBLESOME MP 
 
REF: A. A) HARARE 1247 
 
     ¶B. B) HARARE 1216 
 
¶1.  (U) The anti-Senate faction of the MDC on October 15 
suspended Tafara-Mabvuku MP Timothy Mubawu from his official 
party positions due to his connection to the attack on 
pro-Senate MDC MP Trudy Stevenson (ref B) and his sexist 
remarks in Parliament (ref A).  MDC Secretary General Tendai 
Biti on October 17 told poloff that the party's national 
executive council suspended the MP from his position as 
director of elections for Harare provincial because of his 
links to the attack on the pro-Senate officials, while he was 
also removed from the national executive council because of 
his comments against the Domestic Violence Bill. 
 
¶2.  (U) Biti said that Mubawu's case had been referred to the 
party's disciplinary committee for further review at a yet 
undermined time.  Biti said that the committee would hold a 
hearing to decide if Mubawu should be expelled from the party 
completely ) as opposed to his current suspension from party 
office.  If Mubawu were expelled from the party, Biti noted 
that the MP would lose his seat in parliament, thus prompting 
a by-election.

¶3.  (SBU) Mubawu's connection to the Stevenson attack and his 
regressive comments on gender equality were a blemish on the 
opposition's reputation that has now been addressed. 
Moreover, the manner in which the MDC is handling Mubawu 
shows the party's commitment to due process; the referral to 
the disciplinary committee is a far more transparent means of 
addressing the problem than simply expelling Mubawu.
