DONORS CONFERENCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 129615 
 
Emboff delivered reftel demarche regarding the proposed 
rescheduling of the Pakistan Donors Conference to MFA South 
Asia Desk Officer Katrin Mansson.  Regarding proposed dates, 
Mansson said an earlier conference would not likely result in 
a Swedish donation because Sweden has narrowed its bilateral 
foreign aid in South Asia to focus on Afghanistan.  She 
expressed support for the thrust of the funding initiative 
insofar as it relates to civil society development in 
Pakistan, and when pressed suggested that a more regional 
focus that tied together India, Pakistan and Afghanistan 
might make a Swedish donation more politically palatable. 
Regardless, Sweden would be interested in participating as an 
observer to any Pakistan donor conference.  Mansson made a 
point of noting that Sweden's engagement in the region would 
be closely aligned with the EU efforts, rather than bilateral 
Sweden-Pakistan engagement.  She also noted that the upcoming 
India-EU summit would be a priority for Sweden.
