"Foreign Minister Urges Support of Basic Democratic Principles in 
the World 
 
On May 21st this year there will occur throughout the world an event 
designed to draw attention to and demonstrate support for protection 
of fundamental freedoms in Cuba, as well as in the rest of the 
world. 
 
"Latvia is for basic democratic principles, which are based on 
justice and human rights.  The Latvian public views as fundamental 
those rights which are included both in the constitution of the 
Republic of Latvia, as well as in the UN Declaration of Universal 
Human Rights, whose 60th anniversary we mark this year.  I invite 
the Latvian society, especially NGO's, which represent the views of 
society, and which have experience in the protection of universal, 
basic values, to draw attention to this day and to consider 
possibilities for supporting democratically inclined forces 
throughout the world.  It is up to the inhabitants of each country 
to decide to how to use this support.  Similarly, it is up to the 
inhabitants of each country to decide their future," said Foreign 
Minister Maris Riekstins. 
 
Latvia urges Cuba to guarantee to its citizens their civil, 
economic, political, and social rights in accordance with the UN 
Declaration of Universal Human Rights." (end statement)
