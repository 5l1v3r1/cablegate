Senior Minister Goh on Thursday, June 1, expressed 
Singapore's support for the United States' offer to hold 
direct talks with Iran if it suspends its nuclear enrichment 
program in his meeting with Vice President Cheney.  Tan Yee 
Woan, Director of the International Organisations 
Directorate, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, contacted the 
Economic/Political Counselor on June 5 to highlight the press 
coverage of Senior Minister (SM) Goh's statement.  Local 
press has followed the SM's visit closely, and the SM's 
spokesperson clearly ensured that it widely covered his 
statement of support for the U.S. initiative.
