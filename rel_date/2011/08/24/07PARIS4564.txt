REF:  STATE 158225 
 
¶1.  Per reftel, Post delivered talking points to French Ministries 
of Agriculture (MinAg), Environment, and Economy on low levels of 
unapproved biotech products in imports. 
 
¶2.  French MinAg does not foresee any change in the general EU 
policy on low-level presence of biotech products not authorized in 
the EU but authorized in third countries, i.e., a zero tolerance is 
likely to remain.  Depending on the outcome of ongoing work within 
the Codex Alimentarius on this issue, EU authorities may show more 
flexibility in the future on a case by case basis.  For example, 
imported products that are found to have traces of biotech products 
for which the EU authorization process is advanced may be allowed to 
enter the EU market.
