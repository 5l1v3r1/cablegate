¶1. (SBU) Sudan denounced United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) 
spokeswoman Radhia Achouri for stating that the Sudan Armed Forces 
(SAF) had not completed the withdrawal of its troops from Southern 
Sudan, in violation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).  In 
a July 21 statement, SAF spokesman Brig. Osman Aghabas said that 
Achouri had "deliberately ignored" the delayed withdrawal of Sudan 
People's Liberation Army (SPLA) forces from Eastern Sudan.  Virulent 
attacks by other National Congress Party (NCP) officials also filled 
the newspapers. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a press briefing on July 18, Achouri had asserted 
that the SAF maintained 3,600 troops in Upper Nile State and that 
the SPLA had disputed SAF claims that it should remain in the oil 
areas because the Joint Integrated Units (JIUs) had not arrived. 
Aghabas' statement asserted that "it is the duty of the Government 
to protect these oil fields until the complete redeployment of SPLA 
forces."  He said that the dispute between the SAF and the SPLM 
would be referred to the Presidency, contrary to Achouri's previous 
assertion that the matter would be reviewed by the Ceasefire 
Political Commission (CPC). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: The SAF's fierce attack on Achouri is consistent 
with the NCP's pattern of criticizing individuals who make factual 
assessments of the situation in Sudan.  Former Special 
Representative of the Secretary General Jan Pronk fell victim to 
similar attacks.  CDA Fernandez spoke to Achouri on July 21 and 
expressed the Embassy's solidarity with her and UNMIS in the wake of 
the unwarranted denunciation.  End comment.
