SUBJECT: IRAQI REQUEST TO REMOVE INDIVIDUALS FROM SANCTIONS 
 
REF: A. STATE 71498 
 
     ¶B. BAGHDAD 1940 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Secretariat provided USUN on May 3 with a 
preview of an Iraqi request to the Security Council's 1518 
Committee to delist three individuals currently under 
sanctions for their affiliation with the former Saddam 
Hussein regime.  Once informed of the impending request, the 
USG asked Iraq, both in New York and in Baghdad, (REFTELS) to 
delay the submission of its request until Washington had time 
to review the cases.  Despite these attempts to delay, Iraq 
submitted the formal delisting request on June 6 (sent to 
IO/PSC via email June 6).  The United States and the UK both 
placed holds on the request. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Deputy Political Counselor Molly Phee and PolOffs 
met on June 15 with Ambassador Srood Najib, Head of the Iraqi 
MFA's Department of International Organizations, who was 
visiting New York with the Foreign Minister during the 
mid-year review of UNSCR 1723.  Ambassador Najib underlined 
the importance of these delisting requests to Iraq and 
expressed frustration at the U.S. hold.  He asked USUN to 
provide him with a list of specific U.S. questions/concerns 
about the cases so he could provide clarification.  He 
explained that he is personally handling the issue. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST: Ambassador Najib is one 
of the most influential diplomats in Iraq's Foreign Ministry. 
 He is a key contact for all issues related to Iraq in the 
Security Council.  While he acknowledged that the Iraqi 
mission in New York had failed to consult in a timely fashion 
with USUN about this delisting request, which he prepared in 
November 2006, he argued that these delisting requests are 
legitimate and explained that he is under political pressure 
in Baghdad to move forward on this matter.  USUN requests 
guidance as to any questions/concerns regarding the Iraqi 
requests so that we may engage the Iraqis in a timely fashion.
