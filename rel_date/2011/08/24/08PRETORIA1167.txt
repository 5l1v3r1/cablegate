PARTNERSHIP 
 
REF:  STATE 50488 
 
¶1. (U) The U.S. Mission in South Africa works closely with a range 
of South African counterparts to promote bilateral and multilateral 
maritime issues.  For example, the mission supports U.S. Coast Guard 
programs such as the upcoming International Ship and Port Security 
Country Visit in July.  Several government departments (Departments 
of Defense, Public Enterprise, and Transport), agencies (South 
African Revenue Service and South African Police Service) and 
government-owned parastatals (Transnet National Port Authority) play 
key roles in the South African maritime sector.  Staff from the 
Economic Section and the Defense Attach's Office will continue to 
promote U.S. maritime policy and solicit SAG support for the Global 
Maritime Partnership (GMP) initiative. 
 
¶2. (U) The main points of contact at post are Naval Attach Captain 
Patricia Jackson (Jacksonpa5@state.gov) and Transportation Officer 
Daleya Uddin (Uddinsd@state.gov). Mission staff will ensure that GMP 
principles are communicated to all South African stakeholders via 
Department of Defense, Homeland Security, and State contacts in 
South Africa.  Post will present the talking points to a range of 
SAG officials and report substantive feedback as appropriate.
