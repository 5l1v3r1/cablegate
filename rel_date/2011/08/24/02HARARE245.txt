¶1.   THE JANUARY 25 EDITION OF THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED 
    DAILY "THE HERALD" CARRIED AN ARTICLE ON PAGE ONE, 
    PICKED UP FROM THE JANUARY 24 EDITION OF THE BRITISH 
    GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER, ACCUSING THE U. S. OF FUNDING A 
    "PIRATE RADIO STATION" BROADCASTING TO ZIMBABWE.  THE 
    ARTICLE, UNDER HEADLINE "U. S. FUNDING PIRATE RADIO 
    STATION: PAPER," ACCUSES THE U. S. OF PAYING OUT 
    MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE STATION THROUGH A DEPARTMENT 
    OF THE U. S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
    (USAID) AND THE OFFICE OF TRANSITION INITIATIVES.  THE 
    STATION, WHICH HAS BEEN ON AIR FOR A MONTH AND 
    BROADCASTS THREE HOURS A NIGHT ON SHORT-WAVE IS HEADED 
    BY GERRY JACKSON, A BRITISH NATIONAL WHO WAS SACKED BY 
    THE STATE-RUN ZIMBABWE BROADCASTING CORPORATION FIVE 
    YEARS AGO.  ARTICLE EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   "THE U. S. IS SECRETLY FUNDING A PIRATE RADIO STATION 
    IN LONDON, SW RADIO AFRICA, WIDELY ACCUSED OF FUELLING 
    POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND TRIBAL HATRED WITH ITS NIGHTLY 
    BROADCASTS TO ZIMBABWE. . .MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE 
    BEING CHANNELED TO THE STATION FROM A DEPARTMENT OF THE 
    USAID AND THE OFFICE OF THE TRANSITION INITIATIVES. . 
    .THE STATION'S SPOKESWOMAN AND FORMER ZBC PRESENTER, 
    GEORGINA GODWIN, SAID THAT FUNDING FOR THE STATION CAME 
    FROM 'HUMAN RIGHTS AND MEDIA FREEDOM GROUPS,' BUT WOULD 
    ANSWER NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.  THE GUARDIAN REPORT SAID 
    THAT SW RADIO AFRICA. . .WAS GIVING THE OPPOSITION A 
    PLATFORM, PROVIDING AN ENDLESS DIET OF PROPAGANDA AND 
    FALSEHOODS ON THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION IN 
    THE COUNTRY. . . ."
