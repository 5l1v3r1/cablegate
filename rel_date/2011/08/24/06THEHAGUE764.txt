Poloff delivered reftel demarche April 7 to Head of MFA Human 
Rights Division, Anneke Adema, and human rights policy 
officer Eric Litver.  The GONL, Adema and Litver noted, is 
heavily involved in reftel issues and will certainly take 
action.  Litver said he expects an EU demarche is likely but 
had no further information.
