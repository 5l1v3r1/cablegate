SUBJECT: JOURNALISTS ARRESTED AGAIN 
 
¶1.   On May 22 journalists from the independent weekly 
    "Standard" were arrested for the second time in one 
    week.  Editor-in-Chief Bornwell Chakaodza and 
    entertainment editor Fungayi Kanyuchi were taken to the 
    Central Police Station and questioned for several 
    hours.  They were eventually charged with violating 
    Section 13 of the Censorship and Entertainment Control 
    Act because of photographs of a prostitute published in 
    the May 12 edition of the "Standard." The two were 
    released on 10,000 Zimbabwe dollars (about US$182) bail 
    each late in the afternoon.  The pair was questioned 
    about a number of articles published in the "Standard" 
    before police finally settled on charging them with 
    publishing "indecent" photographs.  (NB: The 
    photographs were of a woman in her underwear.) 
 
¶2.   This is the second time in a week that Chakaodza 
    and Kanyuchi have been arrested.  On May 16 they were 
    arrested and spent a night in police custody for 
    "publishing falsehoods" under the Access to Information 
    and Protection of Privacy Act.  They are to appear in 
    court on June 3 to face those charges.
