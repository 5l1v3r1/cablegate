¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
"Waiting for the Sunset of the Conservatives" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
Issam Dari, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen,  wrote 
(10/11/2006): 
 
"Unlike the case during the term of George Bush Senior, 
Washington is no longer a peace arbitrator.... All paths that 
lead to peace, in the American-Israeli way, must pass through the 
"New Middle East," and through "Grand Israel," according to the 
vision of the Torah and the Talmud. 
 
"Decision-makers in Washington are the ones who have the decision 
of war rather than peace.  They have fancied the war game, 
despite all the catastrophes it creates for the people of the 
region and the American taxpayer.  That's why peace has become 
not only difficult, but impossible, under the auspices of this 
administration, which has eradicated from its political 
dictionary all the vocabulary of peace, dialogue and respect for 
the will of others. 
 
"The situation will remain like this until further notice...and 
maybe until the sun of the Neo-Conservatives has set behind the 
White House." 
--------------------- 
 
"Deluded Dreams and Peace" 
--------------------- 
 
Elias Murad, Editor-in-Chief of government-owned al Baath, wrote 
(10/12/2006): 
 
"Two days ago, President Bashar al Assad reiterated Syria's 
position towards peace, saying that Syria's conditions to achieve 
peace are the same as the conditions of the international 
 
community, and the ideal way to achieve peace is to implement UN 
resolutions 242 and 338. 
 
"Each time we say this, Israel says:  "Syria is imposing 
preconditions for talks.  But what is funny now is the reaction 
that Shimon Peres...has come up with, inviting President Assad 
to visit Jerusalem.... 
"Israel knows and so does the US Administration and the entire 
world that there is no single Syrian citizen who accepts this. 
Peace cannot be achieved through rejected protocol visits.  If 
the Israelis believe that the visit of [former Egyptian President 
Anwar] as-Sadat to Israel has achieved peace, all Arabs, 
including the Egyptian people, believe the contrary.... 
 
"We in Syria believe that the recent Israeli invitations are a 
waste of time, and an attempt to escape the requirements of 
peace, as well as a signal of weakness in the enemy.... 
 
"Israel may be able to find those whom it can convince, with its 
base invitations, that Syria is against peace, but will never be 
able to find a single Arab or a single Syrian."
