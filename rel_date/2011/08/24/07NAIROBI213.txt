¶2. Begin Text: 
 
The Regional Delegation of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross (ICRC) in Nairobi presents its compliments to the 
Embassy of the United States of America and has the honor to 
draw its attention to the following. 
 
The ICRC is of the opinion that the military operations 
carried out by the American forces in the context of the 
armed conflict currently taking place in Somalia are governed 
by the rules applicable to situations of non-international 
armed conflict. 
 
The ICRC as promoter and custodian of international 
humanitarian law, and pursuant to the specific mandate 
conferred on it by the international community, wishes to 
recall the Government of the United States of America that 
military operations must be conducted in accordance with 
Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and customary 
principles and rules applicable in such situations of 
non-international armed conflicts.  The annexed memorandum 
sets out fundamental provisions of international humanitarian 
law that must be respected.  Similar documents have been 
communicated on 24.12.06 to the Transitional Federal 
Government of Somalia, on 25.12.06 to the Government of 
Ethiopia and on 24.12.06 to the Somali Islamic Courts Council. 
 
The ICRC is confident that the Government of the United 
States of America will take every measures required to 
facilitate the humanitarian action of the ICRC and to respect 
its obligations under international humanitarian law. 
 
The International Committee of the Red Cross avails itself of 
this opportunity to convey to the Embassy of the United 
States of America in Nairobi the assurance of its high 
consideration. 
 
Nairobi, January 9, 2007
