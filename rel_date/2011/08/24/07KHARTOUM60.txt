PARTICIPATION IN OPENING OF GOSS MISSION 
 
¶1. (SBU) On the instructions of Minister of Foreign Affairs Lam 
Akol, MFA Director of Americas Amb. Badawi al-Sanosi summoned the 
Charge d'Affaires on January 14.  Al-Sanosi handed Charge Hume a 
copy of a press release by the GoSS regarding a ceremonial event 
announcing the launching of a Government of Southern Sudan mission 
in Washington to take place on January 16.   Director al-Sanosi 
asked the position of the U.S. Government on the invitation, and 
stated that, if senior officials such as AF A/S Frazer and SE 
Natsios attended the event, it would send "wrong signals."  He 
requested that the USG take the position of the Government of Sudan 
into account, particularly in consideration of efforts Khartoum was 
making to respond positively to USG positions. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Hume noted that the Executive branch did not control the 
activities of Members of Congress, and that he would call the matter 
to the Department's attention. 
Al-Sanosi asked that USG officials not participate in the ceremony, 
a request that he said came directly from Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Lam Akol.  In support of his entreaty, he mentioned efforts 
to improve bilateral relations, including support for recent visits 
by Special Envoy Natsios and Governor Richardson.  He further said 
that the Government had just issued a visa to incoming Defense 
Liaison Officer Lt. Col. Bovy and noted that State Minister for 
Foreign Affairs Ali Karti is following up on the detained containers 
conveying New Embassy Compound building materials with the Minister 
of Finance. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  I am particularly concerned that the announced 
participation by senior officials will prompt further delay in 
release of containers with materials for the NEC project. End 
comment. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The press release by the GoSS reads as follows:
