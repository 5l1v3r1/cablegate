¶1. (U) Summary.  In a broadcast to the nation on November 4, 
President Yushchenko accused his political rivals of criminal 
negligence for their handling of the H1N1 outbreak.  Prime Minister 
Tymoshenko, one of the "accused", did not help her case when she on 
the same day publicly indicated that she preferred eating lemon, 
onion and garlic to fight off the flu rather than getting 
vaccinated.  WHO Ukrainian country office head Igor Pokanevych, 
meanwhile, said publically that only a mass H1N1 vaccination of the 
population will stop the epidemic.  Yushchenko urged Ukrainians to 
overcome their negative attitude toward vaccines in general and 
protect themselves with available flu shots.  End Summary. 
 
YUSHCHENKO CHARGES OPPONENTS WITH NEGLIGENCE 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) In the latest episode of a high-level contest to claim credit 
and assign blame for Ukraine's flu outbreak, Yushchenko accused 
Tymoshenko, Party of the Regions leader Yanukovich and Verkhovna 
Rada (Parliament) speaker Lytvyn of criminal negligence for their 
handling of the epidemic.  In a televised address to the nation, 
Yushchenko claimed his opponents were aware of a flu outbreak when 
they held their mass election campaign rallies and compared the 
events to May Day rallies in Kyiv held just days after the Chernobyl 
disaster.  "I see not only moral, but criminal responsibility here," 
Yushchenko said on TV and reportedly asked the Prosecutor General's 
Office "to open a criminal investigation into the cases of 
negligence" amongst Ukraine's top health officials and government 
members. 
 
GARLIC, ONION AS ALTENATIVE TO VACCINES - TYMOSHENKO 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶3. (U) Tymoshenko, addressing residents of Ivano-Frankivsk in 
western Ukraine, said that people must decide whether to get 
vaccinated or protect themselves by "traditional" methods.  "I am 
not vaccinated.  I am protecting myself like everybody -- with 
lemon, onion, garlic [...].  I think the best way to protect your 
health is through well-known means," Tymoshekno said on local TV. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ministry of Health, following the WHO guidelines, 
advised residents of non-quarantined regions to get vaccinated 
against seasonal flu.  Yushchenko also called on the Ukrainians to 
overcome their negative attitude toward vaccines and protect 
themselves with available flu shots.  [Note:  Currently, Ukraine has 
seasonal flu vaccines but no H1N1 vaccines.  Two H1N1 vaccines, 
produced by Russia and Canada, are currently undergoing a 
registration process in Ukraine and could be available in December 
2009-January 2010.  End Note.] 
 
H1N1 VACCINATION NEEDED TO STOP VIRUS - WHO 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) WHO Ukrainian country office head Igor Pokanevych underscored 
the importance of vaccination in an interview with German News 
agency Deutsche Welle.  According to Pokanevych, only a mass 
vaccination of the population with H1N1 vaccines will stop the flu 
outbreak in Ukraine.  Answering a question about the availability of 
H1N1 vaccines in Ukraine, Pokanevych said the WHO has the capability 
to import the vaccines relatively quickly, should the situation in 
Ukraine present a real threat.  At the same time, however, he 
cautioned that the H1N1 vaccine is in high demand around the world, 
not just in Ukraine. 
 
LATEST STATISTICS 
----------------- 
 
¶6. (U) According to the Ministry of Health, at least 87 people have 
now died and more than 250,000 have become sick with flu-like 
symptoms over the past three weeks in Ukraine.  The actual number of 
confirmed cases of swine flu, however, is very small, primarily due 
to the lack of test results.  The outbreak affects 11 out of 25 of 
Ukraine's regions. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Tymoshenko's public snub of flu vaccinations indicates a 
dangerous tendency among Ukrainians to rely on home remedies and 
shun modern medical practices.  Already few Ukrainians receive 
annual flu vaccinations and are skeptical of their safety.  The 
problem extends beyond flu vaccinations as well.  General childhood 
immunization rates have fallen in the past few years as a result of 
sensational stories in the press of children dying as a result of 
routine vaccinations.  It is likely many will shun  H1N1 vaccines

once they do arrive here unless the government quickly unites behind 
a strong public relations campaign, something that will be difficult 
given the ongoing presidential campaign.   End Comment.
