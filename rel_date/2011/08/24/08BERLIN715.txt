IRAQ CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 56560 
 
(SBU) PolOff delivered Reftel points to Dr. Ruediger Lotz, 
Office Director for the MFA's Iraq desk, on May 30.  Lotz 
expressed appreciation for the draft agenda and noted the 
expanded focus of the meeting from prior FOI conferences.  He 
said that a representative from Germany's embassy in Abu 
Dhabi would attend as an observer.  Lotz noted that Germany, 
which is not part of the MNF-I, had generally not actively 
participated in past FOI meetings.  Given the expanded scope 
of this FOI conference, and based on its embassy's read-out 
of the Abu Dhabi conference, Germany may consider 
participating in future meetings with higher-level 
representation.  PolOff will continue to press Germany to 
participate in all Iraq-related meetings at an appropriately 
high level.
