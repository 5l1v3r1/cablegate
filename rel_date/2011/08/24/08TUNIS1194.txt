¶1.  (SBU)  As requested in Ref A Embassy Tunis submitted an 
FY09 Section 1206 proposal to NEA/MAG and PM/PPA via e-mail 
OI November 26.  The proposal titled "Tunisian Intelligence, 
Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) Capability," seeks to 
provide approximately $8 million in immediate assistance to 
the Tunisian Armed Forces, which have undertaken new and 
expanded counter-terrorism activities on Tunisia's borders to 
combat the threat posed by al-Qaeda in the Land of the 
Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Specifically, the 1206 proposal seeks to respond to 
Tunisian Air Force's need to conduct day/night air operations 
to reduce availability of the border region to al-Qaeda 
terrorists.  In the proposal we recomment providing Tunisian 
helicopter units with Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR), 
Radar Altimeters (RADAL), and Global Positioning Systems 
(GPS)configured for use with night vision goggles - all of 
which will be dedicated to supporting counter-terrorism 
activities. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  I urge the Department and USAFRICOM to support this 
proposal and continue to back the Tunisian Government's 
efforts to combat the transnational terrorist threat posed by 
AQIM.  OSC Tunis sent the short-form to AFRICOM Security 
Assistance Branch on 31 October, 2008 and the long-form on 13 
November 2008.
