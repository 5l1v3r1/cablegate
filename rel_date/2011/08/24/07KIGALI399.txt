SUBJECT: RWANDA TIP PROPOSAL FOR G/TIP MANAGED ESF AND 
INCLE FUNDS 
 
REF: STATE 28157 
 
¶1. This is an action request, please see paragraph 5. 
 
¶2. Summary.  Rwanda is a country attempting to focus on child 
prositution and other forms of trafficking in persons.  Due 
in part to post's regular pressure on the GOR to address the 
problem, on 23 April the Rwandan National Police (RNP) 
submitted a project proposal that identifies appropriate 
anti-TIP objectives for the RNP, but it does not include the 
required details to apply for G/TIP ESF/INCLE funding.  Post 
is encouraged by the GOR's willingness to strengthen the rule 
of law and the capacity of the criminal justice system to 
combat trafficking in persons and requests recommendations 
from G/TIP as to how to best assist it with ESF and INCLE 
funds.  End Summary. 
 
¶3. The RNP's project proposal identifies the Criminal 
Investigation Department (CID) as the lead component for the 
RNP in combating TIP.  The proposal acknowledges that 
"trafficking in persons in Rwanda is a crime that has not 
been adequately addressed due to various reasons" and it 
details some of the challenges (Note. Rwanda desk has a full 
copy of the project proposal. End note.)  The RNP identifies 
five objectives in the proposal: 
-- To carry out extensive research and assess TIP 
information, collection and proactive recording in Rwanda 
-- To increase public awareness on the issues TIP and the 
role of police in TIP combating 
-- To develop a coordination mechanism on human trafficking 
at (the) national level 
-- To increase awareness on human trafficking and human 
rights for stakeholders at all levels 
-- To increase police capacity in dealing with human 
trafficking issues 
 
¶4. The proposal requests funding for five activities to 
support the objectives: 
-- Professional gender expert for 6 months to carry out 
research and data collection (USD 5,454) 
-- Organizing training for investigators and judicial police 
officers (USD 18,181) 
-- Organize and hold stakeholders workshops on human 
trafficking and human rights at provincial levels (USD 27,272) 
-- Media campaigns and advocacy materials on TIP and 
disseminate them (USD 27,272) 
 
¶5. Although the GOR's project proposal lacks some detail, we 
see merit in the overall concept.  Post will work with the 
RNP to refine its proposal and appreciates all input from 
G/TIP.  Specifically, please advise post if there are NGOs 
capable of performing the development of anti-TIP written 
policies  and procedures for the RNP and/or implementation of 
improved procedures for the RNP to identify and rescue 
victims, conduct investigations, protect and assist victims, 
and prosecute traffickers. Or, does G/TIP recommends direct 
assistance to the GOR? 
 
¶6. Post appreciates all guidance from G/TIP on assisting the 
GOR with its efforts to combat TIP.  Post point of contact is 
pol chief Richard Kaminski (250.505.601 ext. 3304).
