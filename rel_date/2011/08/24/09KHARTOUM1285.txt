CONSTITUENCY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On November 15, the Minister of Agriculture 
Samson Kwaje was shot while traveling to his home constituency in 
Juba County, Central Equatoria, to register.  Kwaje was traveling in 
a six car convoy which was ambushed in the early evening on the 
Lainya-Jambo road.  The reason for the attack is still unclear. 
Kwaje was shot in the upper arm and is being medevaced to Nairobi 
today, November 16. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) While traveling in a six car convoy along the Lainya-Jambo 
road in Central Equatoria on November 15, the Minister of 
Agriculture Samson Kwaje's convoy was ambushed, explained 
Undersecretary for Presidential Affairs Cirino Hiteng Ofuho.  Cirino 
told us that the attackers aim was to assassinate Kwaje.  The attack 
happened in the early evening hours in a remote area.  The 
assailants blocked the road in front of and behind the convoy in 
what is reported to be a very organized attack.  The assailants open 
fired on the convoy, shooting Kwaje in the upper arm, critically 
wounding his body guard and killing five others in the group.  The 
number of dead and wounded suffered by the assailants is not known. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The United Nations (UN) and Sudan People's Liberation Army 
(SPLA) were both contacted during the evening of November 15, but 
due to the late hour and location neither were able to reach Kwaje's 
group until November 16.  Some reports claim that the SPLA were 
blocked from getting to Kwaje by others involved in the attack. 
However, UN Humanitarian Coordinator Lise Grande told us the UN sent 
a helicopter to airlift Kwaje and the wounded from the incident and 
transported them to Juba. Kwaje will depart Juba on the November 16 
Jetlink flight to Nairobi for additional treatment. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Circumstances around the incident are still not clear. 
Cirino told us that the attack is connected to local tribal issues. 
Others believe the attack has to do with local political issues 
surrounding the changing of constituency borders within Juba County, 
Central Equatoria. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Although motives for the attack are as yet 
unclear, it took place under circumstances closely related to the 
election, against a very senior GoSS official.  Even if the attack 
arose solely from local tribal issues, it reflects a spread of 
tribal violence into a new area of Southern Sudan.  End Comment.
