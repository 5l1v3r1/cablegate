Post hopes that Karl-Erik Goffinet will be able to consult 
with key U.S. institutions and policy makers on current 
thinking about the transatlantic relationship; the second Bush 
administration; the U.S. government structure and current U.S. 
foreign and defense policies.  This trip will allow Mr. 
Goffinet to move ahead and explore the possibility of 
reestablishing bridges, in terms of the future, between France 
and the United States.  French decision makers very often rely 
on information gathered in the media.  This mission will 
provide Karl-Erik Goffinet with actual material that he will 
in return pass on to key French officials and to UMP staff 
working on transatlantic relations.  Another one of his task 
will be to introduce himself and meet key policy makers in 
order to set up and maintain an informal dialogue with 
American contacts.  Mr. Goffinet was a FY 96 IV.  He is a 
close contact of the Public Affairs Section and, through 
GICAT, maintains regular relations with the Office of Defense 
Cooperation (ODC). 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD:

-  Understanding/management of communication process within 
the Administration. 
END MEMO VIS-OBJ: 
START MEMO VIS-REC: 
Mr. Goffinet would appreciate the following meetings:

brief meeting with him would interest Mr. Goffinet, with an 
PROJ-NAME: VolVis - Fiscal Year 2005 - Karl-Erik Goffinet

exclusive political view.  Mr. Goffinet would like to 
understand globally how one builds up and manages an American

Policy priorities and evolution of EU-U.S. relations with an 
emphasis on France-U.S. relations. 
-  Department of Commerce (Office of Strategic Industries and 
Economic Security).  Mr. Goffinet would like to discuss

-  Media: foreign affairs journalists  (Washington Post, 
Herald Tribune).

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Post strongly supports this Voluntary Visitor project and 
hopes that ECA will be able to schedule it in the time frame 
proposed by the visitor.  With the attention focused on the 
European Union due to the debate about the Constitution, it is 
important for the USG to reiterate that the United States has 
long supported a strong Europe, a concept that is often argued 
in France.  USG and Post need to explain that cooperating 
partners are more beneficial than opposing "poles" or "counter 
weights" to each other.  Mr. Goffinet plays a major liaison 
PROJ-NAME: VolVis - Fiscal Year 2005 - Karl-Erik Goffinet 
START MEMO PROJ-DESC: 
 
and substantive role on a myriad of Franco-American issues. 
Mr. Goffinet is a candidate with impressive academic 
credentials who looks forward to a future as a decision maker 
in the European defense sector.  Upon his return, Goffinet 
expects to brief UMP staffers on the evolution of 
transatlantic relations and provide them with contacts in 
Washington D.C.  By participating in this Voluntary Visitor 
trip, Mr. Goffinet will acquire expertise in European-American 
relations, will gain understanding of our policies and 
communicate a more positive view of the United States among 
French Government officials that would help the re- 
strengthening of Franco-American bilateral ties.  We highly 
recommend Mr. Goffinet for consideration for a VolVis. 
Karl-Erik Goffinet is a French citizen who is Vice-President 
for European Affairs within the Defense Federation of the 
major right-wing party, the UMP (Union pour un Mouvement 
Populaire -- Union for a Popular Movement, a unified 
pluralistic, democratic and decentralized movement).  Mr. 
Goffinet's responsibilities are planning exchange 
relationships with UMP's homologous parties in the European 
field and in the defense domain.  FYI, Nicolas Sarkozy (I.V. 
1985), former Finance Minister, heads the UMP Party since 
November 2004.  Mr. Sarkozy is one of France's most well known 
political figures and is considered to be the man to watch in 
the next (2007) French Presidential Elections.  Under his 
leadership, the UMP Party has been reorganized to permit an in- 
depth reflection on transatlantic relationship.  Mr. Serge 
Dassault presides over the "Defense Federation", an internal 
UMP body whose main vocation is to ensure the continued 
existence of a strong defense policy, particularly in the 
industrial field, able to meet the challenges of the 21st 
century.  This Federation has a Consortium whose members are 
elected for a three-year mandate.  Mr. Goffinet belongs to the 
executive committee for the Federation and, in that capacity 
is very interested in learning more about the U.S. position 
and in building stronger links to appropriate entities 
(private and government) 
Mr. Goffinet is also Vice-President for International 
Relations and Strategic Affairs at GICAT (Groupement des 
Industries Concernees par les Materiels de Defense Terrestre-- 
"French Land Defense Manufacturers Association".  GICAT is a 
private industry association regrouping most French companies 
in the land defense sector and reportedly enjoys close 
relations with the Association of the U.S. Army (AUSA).  GICAT 
has the attention of key French Government officials, 
including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense, as 
well as direct access to most of Europe's defense decision 
makers and strategic planning organizations. GICAT is a strong 
supporter of the "Europeanization" of the defense industry, 
which is currently underway as a natural consequence of the 
defense market's international restructuring.  In his current 
position, Mr. Goffinet is actively working on the strategic 
development of a policy of cooperation between Europe and the 
United States in both land and air domains.  He has been 
working closely with GOF, USG, French and American industry 
associations to explore avenues to improve industry 
cooperation.  Mr. Goffinet is actively initiating programs to 
improve international understanding and communication as a 
means to break down invisible barriers to multilateral 
cooperation. 
With a PhD on "The New European Architecture in Terms of 
Defense and Security", a Masters Degree in International 
Relations and another Masters in Political Science, Mr. 
Goffinet is a knowledgeable specialist in Defense and 
Security.  Mr. Goffinet is also Vice-President of European 
Affairs and Transatlantic Relations at CIDEF (Conseil des 
Industries de Defense Francaises -- French Defense Industry 
Council).  CIDEF can be described as the French Industry's

holding structure, which consolidates the three main French 
arms industry unions (GIFAS, GICAN and GICAT).  CIDEF is 
alternatively presided over by one of these unions' President 
(GICAT for the moment).  CIDEF has a light structure with 
three permanent missions: Lobbying, European affairs and 
transatlantic relations, and regulation.  Mr. Goffinet 
coordinates issues concerning Europe and Transatlantic 
Relations.  His responsibilities deal essentially with the 
conception and implementation of the French industry's 
positions in Europe.  He is also in charge of following up on 
bilateral relations with the United States.
