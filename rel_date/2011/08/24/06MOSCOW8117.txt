¶1.  (SBU) The MFA told us that Foreign Minister Sergey 
Viktorovich Lavrov will likely lead the Russian delegation at 
the 61st UNGA.  The Foreign Ministry is awaiting Kremlin 
approval of the delegation list.  There are no plans at this 
time for President Putin or PM Fradkov to attend. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Travel dates for FM Lavrov have not yet been 
determined.  There are no specific requests for bilateral 
meetings at this time, although the MFA expected that such 
requests would be received.  FM Lavrov speaks English and 
would not need interpretation in meetings. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  FM Lavrov will likely be accompanied by DFM 
Aleksandr Yakovenko, Chairman of the Russian Federation 
Council International Affairs Committee Mikhail Margelov, and 
Chairman of the Duma International Affairs Committee 
Konstantin Kosachev.
