In support of a day of solidarity with the Cuban 
People (reftels), Post will place an op-ed in a major 
local newspaper based on the text provided Ref A.  We 
are also working with Helsinki University (HU), 
the local business community, and the Caisa 
Intercultural Foundation to sponsor cultural and 
other awareness activities regarding the human rights 
situation in Cuba.  A highlight of this will be a DVC 
roundtable discussin either in the summer or early 
fall for academis and/or business leaders with WHA 
Cuba Transitin Coordinator Caleb McCarry, sponsored 
by either U or the local AmCham.
