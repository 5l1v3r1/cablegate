On the Political/Social Front 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Mugabe and Tsvangirai Reach Deal...  After four days of 
mediation, President Mugabe and MDC leader Tsvangirai appeared to 
strike a power sharing deal last night.  As described, the deal 
includes the creation of a Council of Ministers (COM) that will 
formulate policy and is chaired by Tsvangirai.  Implementation of 
policy will reside with the Cabinet, which will continue to report 
to Mugabe with Tsvangirai as deputy.  According to press reports, 
the agreement also creates a National Security Council chaired by 
Mugabe with Tsvangirai again as his deputy, along with the Minister 
of Defense, Home Affairs, and possibly others.  Of the 31 Ministries 
(that constitute Cabinet and the COM), ZANU-PF will appoint 15, 
MDC-T will appoint 13, and MDC-M has the remaining 3.  Uncertainty 
remains over how the ministries will be divided.  The deal is 
scheduled to be formally signed Monday morning.  See Harare 828. 
 
¶4.  Last Two MDC MPs Released on Bail...  Following a High Court 
ruling yesterday, the remaining two MDC MPs were released on bail. 
The MPs Pearson Mungofa of Highfield and Bednock Nyaude of Bindura 
South had been granted bail last week, but were not released at the 
time because the state appealed against the move. 
 
¶5.  USG-Funded NGOs Resuming Field Operations...  Partners are in 
high gear, obtaining field level approvals from local authorities to 
resume operations.  Meanwhile, WFP and C-SAFE received approval from 
the Ministry of Social Welfare for their food delivery programs.  In 
addition, the Ministry has agreed to registration protocols to 
identify food aid beneficiaries.  C-SAFE will undertake a pilot 
registration program in Kadoma next week and then registrations will 
quickly begin in other areas.  C-SAFE began school feeding this week 
throughout all of its districts, and has obtained approval from all 
district authorities to implement the Safety Net Program.  Given 
 
HARARE 00000832  002 OF 003 
 
 
registration requirements and logistics, no food is likely to be 
distributed via either C-SAFE's Safety Net Program or WFP's 
Vulnerable Group Feeding Program until mid to late October. 
Non-food aid partners supported by the USG are also ramping up 
operations, including Oxfam and Mercy Corps. 
 
¶6.  Canada Imposes Sanctions on Zimbabwe...  The Canadian Foreign 
Ministry announced sanctions against Zimbabwe on September 4 on the 
basis of the regime's violation of human rights and "perversion of a 
legitimate democratic process," according to Foreign Affairs 
Minister David Emerson.  The sanctions include a ban on the export 
of arms, freezing the assets of top Zimbabwean officials, and 
prohibiting Zimbabwean aircraft from flying over or landing in 
Canada.  Emerson made clear that the sanctions would not affect the 
Zimbabwean people and that Canada would continue to provide 
humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe. 
 
¶7.  Cholera Outbreak in Crowded Township...  Eight people have died 
and 23 have been hospitalized following an outbreak of cholera in 
one of Harare's crowded townships.  The outbreak occurred last week 
in Chitungwiza, a township of approximately a million people in 
Harare's southern outskirts that suffers from broken sewers. 
Zimbabwe has suffered several cholera outbreaks in recent years 
following the collapse of infrastructure due to the country's 
political and economic crisis.  USAID is responding through its 
implementing partners by stocking retail outlets and clinics with 
water purification tablets and promoting hygienic practices.

On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  Reserve Bank Allows Some Formal Dollarization...  Amid 
widespread informal dollarization of the economy, RBZ Governor Gono 
announced the licensing of foreign exchange wholesale and retail 
shops, plus service stations, allegedly to increase the availability 
of basic good and improve manufacturers' capacity utilization, but 
certainly also in the hope of filling the government's forex 
coffers.  He also reduced the foreign exchange surrender requirement 
on exporters and announced new price support for the gold sector. 
We questioned the timing of the announcement and don't expect the 
initiative to put the country on a sustainable recovery path. See 
Harare 786 and 822. 
 
¶9.  Maize Seed Shortage Threatens Crop...  Zimbabwe is heading into 
the summer planting season about one third short of needed seed 
maize.  The past year's seed maize crop was poor.  On top of that, 
price controls have deterred farmers from growing the crop and 
delivering it to the formal market.  A seed house senior executive 
told us the 2008/09 commercial maize harvest could be the smallest 
since independence.  See Harare 821. 
 
¶10.  World Bank Rates Zimbabwe One of the Least Investor-Friendly 
Countries...  The World Bank Group's Doing Business 2009 report 
ranked Zimbabwe a dismal 158 out of 181 countries surveyed, down 
from 152 a year ago. See http://www.doingbusiness.org/. 
 
¶11.  Zimbabwe's Protracted Arrears to the IFIs...  At end-June 2008 
Zimbabwe owed the IMF about US$137 million; its total arrears to the 
international financial institutions came to about US$1.1 billion. 
The IMF Executive Board took note in July of Zimbabwe's poor 
cooperation on policies and payments and recommended maintaining the 
suspension of Zimbabwe's voting rights and its ineligibility to 
access IMF resources. See http://www.imf.org/external 
pp/longres.aspx?id=4277. 
 
¶12.  Inflation Factoid...  Zimbabwe's highest-denomination Z$500 
note, worth US$33 on the street at its issuance six weeks ago, 
 
HARARE 00000832  003 OF 003 
 
 
fetches only 90 US cents on the same market today.

Quote of the Week 
----------------- 
 
¶13.  An EU diplomat speaking on the deal, reported in the Zimbabwe 
Independent of September 12:  "We will see, the devil is in the 
details---we will see on Monday how the power is shared and if the 
opposition has more than a symbolic role."
