CONFERENCE 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 102464 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 112030 
 
¶1. (SBU) We called on the MFA Deputy Director General for 
South Asia, Babur Hizlan, on July 10 to invite Turkey to the 
July 20-21 conference on enhancing Provincial Reconstruction 
Team (PRT) effectiveness co-sponsored by the governments of 
Canada and the United States and hosted by the Government of 
Hungary in Budapest (reftels).  Hizlan expressed appreciation 
for the invitation, about which MFA had already heard from 
its embassy in Kabul.  Hizlan anticipates that Turkish 
representatives at the conference will be the prospective 
civilian coordinator for the Wardak Province PRT and a 
military representative.  One of Hizlan's aides called July 
11 to inform us that MFA Director General for the Middle East 
and South Asia, Bozkurt Aran, may attend as well. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We also inquired about the latest status of Turkey's 
PRT in Wardak Province.  Hizlan reported that initial 
operations will probably be delayed until November, since a 
construction company still has not been named; he believes a 
company will be named in a few weeks.  Nevertheless, Turkey 
will deliver development aid before construction is 
completed.  In addition, Ambassador Koray Targay, the Turkish 
Coordinator for Reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq, is 
currently in Wardak with TIKA (the Turkish AID-equivalent) 
representatives to determine whether any projects can be 
launched before the PRT is operational. Once operational, 
Turkey expects that the PRT will be staffed by 60-70 military 
personnel and 15-20 security personnel for force protection 
and police training.  MFA, MOI, and TIKA short-term personnel 
will rotate to the PRT as needed.
