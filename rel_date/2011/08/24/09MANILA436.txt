REF: STATE 16285 
 
¶1. (SBU)  In a February 26 discussion with Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DFA) Director Leah Ruiz of the Office of 
United Nations and Other International Organizations (UNIO), 
Post stressed reftel points and urged the Philippines to 
issue strong statements calling on Iran to implement its 
international nuclear obligations without delay and demanding 
that Syria cooperate with the IAEA's investigation. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Director Ruiz said the Philippine government is 
studying Director General ElBaradei's latest report on Iran 
and Syria's nuclear programs.  She assured Post that the 
Philippine government appreciates the gravity of the 
situation and will carefully consider the U.S. position in 
formulating its position in advance of next week's IAEA Board 
of Governors meeting.  The Director was also receptive to the 
idea of voting to make the IAEA report on Syria public, but 
added that the Philippines has not made a final decision on 
that matter. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Given the Philippine government's strong preference 
for achieving consensus in any international discussions, it 
is likely that it will take a wait-and-see approach at the 
Board of Governors meeting to determine the majority view 
before committing itself.  The Philippine government will 
also probably try to avoid supporting any action that would 
risk alienating either Iran or Syria unless such action is 
the result of a clear consensus among the other board members 
that would provide political cover for the Philippines.
