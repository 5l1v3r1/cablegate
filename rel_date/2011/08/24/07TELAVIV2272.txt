Key Stories in the Media:

Israel Radio reported that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said 
in interview with Radio Sawa that "The President ... was stating 
very clearly that Israel's future will rest in Israel, in places 
like Galilee and in the Negev, and that the occupation of the West 
Bank will have to end and a Palestinian state will need to be 
established." 
 
Ha'aretz reported that three weeks ago Israel authorized the 
transfer of 1,000 rifles from Jordan to PA security forces in the 
West Bank. 
 
Maariv published excerpts from an exclusive interview with PA 
President Mahmoud Abbas (the full interview will be published on 
Friday). Abbas said that President Bush promised him that a 
permanent agreement will be reached within a year. Abbas was also 
quoted as saying that he may not run for re-election and voiced 
support for Marwan Barghouti should he decide to run. 
 
Ha'aretz cited a senior government source as saying that talks 
between Israel and Saudi Arabia have been taking place through a 
third party for some time and that a meeting with the Saudis may 
happen soon. 
 
Leading media reported that Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah 
Khatib and Egyptian Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit said in a meeting 
with PM Olmert that they hope to bring along other foreign ministers 
the next time they visit. 
 
Israel Radio reported that Israel and the Palestinian Authority 
announced Wednesday that they are ready once again to renew 
coordination of civil administration functions. The media noted that 
the swearing-in of Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayad's 
government gave a green light to the resumption of cooperation on 
both the civil and the security level. 
 
Yediot quoted Hamas senior member, Dr. Ahmed Yosef, as saying to the 
Palestinian news agency "Ma'an" that Hamas will eventually take over 
the West Bank. 
 
Israel Radio reported that a Hamas militant was killed Thursday 
morning by an Israeli Air Force strike east of Khan Yunis in the 
Gaza Strip. 
 
All media reported that the general strike that began Wednesday 
morning ended when an agreement was reached Wednesday night. 
 
All media reported on violent confrontations between the police and 
right-wing activists who attempted to establish an illegal outpost 
in Gush Etzion. Thirty activists were arrested and a few were 
injured. 
 
All media reported that the High Court of Justice met on Wednesday 
to discuss the plea agreement for former President Moshe Katzav. 
The court ordered the Attorney General to explain why the court 
should not anull plea bargain. 
 
Maariv printed the following results of a TNS/Teleseker Polling 
Institute survey: 59 percent of the public believe that the 
unilateral disengagement from Gaza was a mistake; 29 percent believe 
it was the right decision; 12 were undecided. According to the poll 
74 percent are against evacuating settlements from the West Bank 
unilaterally, while 18 percent are in favor.

Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "It is dawning on the people around the prime 
minister that there is no substitute for an Israeli diplomatic 
initiative that will extricate Olmert from his public opinion 
troubles and make a mark in the history of the state.... External 
events today also tend toward diplomacy." 
 
The nationalist Makor Rishon-Hatzofe editorialized: "There is almost 
no doubt that the diplomatic buzz that started with the arrival of 
Tony Blair marks the beginning of Ehud Olmert's survival battle.... 
The danger is that out of every buzz something practical may 
emerge."

Â¶I. "Solving a Few Problems At Once" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (07/26): "Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has a 
problem.  He is finding it difficult to persuade the Israeli public 
and international community that his government seriously intends to 
reach a settlement with the Palestinians and is willing to pay the 
price of withdrawing from territory and evacuating the 
settlements.... It is dawning on the people around the prime 
minister that there is no substitute for an Israeli diplomatic 
initiative that will extricate Olmert from his public opinion 
troubles and make a mark in the history of the state.... External 
events today also tend toward diplomacy. After a year and a half of 
a diplomatic standstill with the government of Palestinian Authority 
Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, there is once again someone to talk to in 
the PA.... U.S. President George W. Bush, Quartet envoy Tony Blair, 
Egypt and Jordan are willing to extend a hand from the outside, each 
for their own reasons.  Olmert's proposal of an Agreement of 
Principles regarding a Palestinian state solves a number of his 
problems.  First, he is taking the initiative.... Second, the 
initiative underscores the message that Israel wants an agreement 
and is not seeking excuses to stay in the territories. Third, it 
responds to the international demand to provide a 'diplomatic 
horizon' for Palestinian moderates.  Fourth, Olmert wants to give up 
territory, even unilaterally.  If he signs Abbas onto the deal, he 
will achieve something for the merchandise he was ready to give away 
for free.  Fifth, the deal he is proposing focuses on changing 
reality in the West Bank and Gaza, and sets aside the refugee 
problem ... Sixth, the formulation of the details and the 
implementation of the agreement, which involve significant 
difficulties for both sides, will wait for the approval of the 
Agreement of Principles in Palestinian elections and a Knesset 
vote.... Seventh, the prime minister's expected political and 
personal advantage should not be ignored.... If he radiates 
credibility, he may even improve in the polls, and his declared 
intention to run for another term against party leaders Benjamin 
Netanyahu and Ehud Barak will seem serious and possible." 
 
II. "Buzz" 
 
The nationalist Makor Rishon-Hatzofe editorialized (07/26): "There 
is almost no doubt that the diplomatic buzz that started with the 
 
arrival of Tony Blair marks the beginning of Ehud Olmert's survival 
battle.... The danger is that out of every buzz something practical 
may emerge.  Israel's actions in the strategic, diplomatic reality 
are happening in three circles: one, against Iran and its 
nuclearatization; second, the attempt to reach a diplomatic solution 
with the Palestinians and third, the practical dimension of the war 
on terror and achieving deterrence against it.... In the Palestinian 
circle, all experts -- even the most moderate ones -- believe that 
there is no chance of achieving a meaningful agreement with the 
Palestinians."
