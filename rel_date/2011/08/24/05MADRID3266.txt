¶1.  (SBU)  I see no downside or embarrassment if GE Spain is 
selected as one of this year's awardees for the Secretary of 
State's Award for Corporate Excellence.  In fact, such 
recognition would highlight the contributions of a very 
responsible corporate citizen that contributes to both 
United States and Spanish economic growth.  GE Spain imports 
tens of millions of dollars worth of products and services 
produced in the United States each year.  While the firm has 
a major plastics production facility in Spain, it imports 
power generation, medical, and transport equipment. 
Significant portions of each of these are sourced from 
facilities in the United States.  I can state with 
confidence that GE Spain thus contributes directly to job 
creation in the United States.  GE Spain is also a model 
employer.  It consistently ranks highly in Spanish "best 
place to work" surveys.  Its environmental, health and 
safety records are exemplary.  GE Spain's major facility in 
Cartegena is unionized. 
 
¶2.  (U)  In sum, I am please to reaffirm our nomination of 
GE Spain for this award.
