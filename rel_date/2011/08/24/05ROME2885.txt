¶1. (U) DCM has requested an appointment to discuss reftel 
demarche with the MFA's Director General for the 
Mediterranean and the Middle East.  In the meantime, below 
are comments from PM Berlusconi and Deputy PM/FM Fini 
regarding the Iraqi constitution. 
 
¶2. (U)  In an August 28 press statement following his meeting 
with President Putin in Russia, PM Berlusconi said he and 
Putin had discussed the new Iraqi constitution and were 
"pleased with the Constitutional Assembly's approval."  He 
added that the constitution showed a "very broad" consensus 
and expressed his optimism that Sunni objections would be 
overcome.  Furthermore, Berlusconi praised the document 
itself, saying it contained "all the principles of a 
democracy." 
 
¶3. (U) In an August 29 press statement, FM and Deputy PM Fini 
echoed these sentiments, saying the constitution "recognizes 
fundamental values and principles."  While calling the 
failure of the Sunnis to sign the document a "negative 
element," Fini nevertheless said that some Sunni political 
representatives  are showing some positive signals, and that 
"we have to continue to use all possible diplomatic efforts 
so that the Sunni community votes in the referendum."  Fini 
added, "the international community must work in order not to 
make this great opportunity go to waste."
