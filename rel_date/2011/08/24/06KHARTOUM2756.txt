¶1.  Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) supports a 
small detachment of officers serving as advisors to the African 
Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) in El Fasher.  On November 28, a 
CJTF-HOA HC-130, call sign PAT 332, landed in El Fashir, Darfur, at 
approximately 1450, on a scheduled mission to pick up personal gear 
belonging to members of the CJTF AMIS advisory detachment that had 
recently departed. 
 
¶2.  As Sudan's only airports of entry are Khartoum and Port Sudan, 
the HC-130 aircraft was scheduled to fly from Djibouti to Khartoum, 
proceed to El Fasher to pick up the cargo, and then refuel in 
Khartoum before the return leg to Djibouti.  This flight was 
scheduled over a month ago, and all of the necessary overflight and 
landing clearances were requested (Diplomatic Note 663 of 26 October 
2006) and received (CAA Clearance # CA/7/A7/M/2/2/2853). 
 
¶3.  The first two legs of the mission proceeded according to plan. 
A military representative met the aircraft in El Fasher and loaded 
the cargo.  As the HC-130 was at the end of the runway preparing to 
depart, Sudanese air traffic controllers required it to return to 
the ramp area and shut down its engines.  Evidently, military 
intelligence personnel were disturbed by the presence of a 
Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) Turret on the nose of the aircraft, 
believing that the crew was recording photographs of Sudanese 
facilities and activities.  The officials did not believe the 
aircrew's assurance that there was no recording taking place, and 
wanted access to the aircraft, which the crew would not permit. 
 
¶4.  A standoff ensued while Embassy personnel tried to contact 
officials in Khartoum to resolve the situation.  At El Fasher, 
Sudanese officials searched the outgoing cargo and then insisted 
that the crew depart the aircraft for the night because the airport 
was closed.  The crew again refused, and the two sides were at an 
impasse.  After some time passed, the military representative was 
taken to see the Colonel in charge of airport security, and the 
Colonel agreed to clear the aircraft for departure pending payment 
of a landing fee.  The plane was permitted to continue on to 
Khartoum at approx. 2015 without payment of any additional landing 
fees. 
 
¶5.  The return leg to Khartoum, refueling, and departure for 
Djibouti all proceeded without further incident.
