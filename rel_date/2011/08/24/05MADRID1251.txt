¶5. In general, Spain is safe. However, Madrid, Barcelona and 
other large cities in Spain - including resort/convention areas 
such as Benidorm - attract a large number of criminals and 
pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of opportunity 
against the unwary do occur. Carry only essential items including 
a photo-copy of your passport's photo page. Visitors can protect 
themselves against crime by being street-smart, alert and aware 
of their surroundings.  In the event you are victimized by crime, 
or experience any security-related incident, please contact the 
Embassy's Regional Security Office at 91-587-2550 or after ours 
at 91-587-2355.  Official visitors to the Embassy in Madrid or 
the Consulate General in Barcelona are encouraged to receive a 
security briefing from the RSO office at their earliest 
convenience.  Additional information regarding safety and 
security in Spain is available on the U.S. Department of State's 
website (http://www.state.gov) and the U.S. Embassy's website 
(www.embusa.es). 
 
 
¶6. Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide 
Caution issued by the Department of State.  As the Department of 
State continues to develop information on any potential security 
threats to Americans overseas, it shares credible threat 
information through its Consular Information Program documents, 
available on the Internet at http://travel/state.gov.  In 
addition to information on the Internet, U.S. travelers can hear 
recorded information by calling the Department of State in 
Washington, D.C. at 202-647-5225 from their touch-tone telephone, 
or receive information by automated telefax by dialing 202-647- 
3000 from their fax machine.
