¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  There were two nearly simultaneous bomb 
blasts at luxury hotels in Jakarta early on July 17.  Nine 
people were reportedly killed and at least 50 people were 
injured, including eight confirmed Americans.  President 
Yudhoyono and other senior officials promised a thorough 
investigation and urged Indonesians to maintain their normal 
activities.  The GOI has expressed appreciation to the 
Secretary for her comments in Prague.  Mission has offered 
USG support to law enforcement operations.  Suggested press 
guidance is contained in para 8.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TWO BOMB BLASTS IN JAKARTA 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In the early morning of July 17, seemingly 
coordinated bombs exploded in two adjacent luxury hotels in 
Jakarta.  The blast at the JW Marriott hotel occurred at 7:41 
am (local time) and the blast at the Ritz Carlton Hotel 
occurred at 7:50 am.  Authorities have reported nine deaths 
(some were expatriates but no Amcits) and approximately 50 
people injured in the incidents.  Indonesian police also 
reportedly found bomb-making materials and defused an 
unexploded bomb on the 18th floor of the JW Marriott Hotel. 
There are unconfirmed reports that the blasts were caused by 
suicide bombers.  A subsequent third explosion on a toll road 
from Jakarta to the Sukarno Hatta International Airport was 
due to an electrical short circuit and not related to the two 
blasts in Jakarta. 
 
AMERICAN CITIZENS SITREP 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Mission is working to account for American citizens 
who may have been killed or injured in the bombings or 
otherwise impacted.  We have confirmed that eight American 
citizens were injured, including Exploration Director of 
Freeport Indonesia David Potter, Anadarko Indonesia's General 
Manager Gary Ford, Husky Oil North Sumbawa LTD's Kevin S. 
Moore, and Director of CastleAsia James Castle.  All have 
received medical treatment and three were evacuated to 
Singapore.  (Note: We do not have privacy act waivers for 
these individuals, please protect.)  No Americans appear to 
have life threatening injuries. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Mission convened two EACs and issued warden 
messages regarding the incidents to American citizens. 
Mission evaluated authorized departure and rejected that as 
inappropriate at this time.  Consular and regional security 
officers visited the sites of both blasts to learn of 
American casualties and assist.  Consular and regional 
security officers also visited local hospitals and the morgue 
to identify remains, none of whom were Amcits.  The Consular 
Section will be open on Saturday, July 18, from 9:00 am to 
3:00 pm for emergency passport services.  Consular officers 
will also visit hospitals and the hotels to which affected 
Americans were moved.  Mission has sent regular updates to 
the Ops Center (see ref). 
 
GOI REACTION 
 
¶5.  (SBU) President Yudhoyono addressed the media at 2:00 pm 
(local).  He acknowledged that the terrorist threat remains, 
underlined his commitment to prosecuting the perpetrators, 
and urged Indonesians to continue with their lives. 
Yudhoyono also visited some of the injured at a local 
hospital.  He cautioned against speculation that the attacks 
may be related to his reelection.  He was accompanied in his 
address by Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal, and 
Security  Widodo Adi Sucipto, National Police Chief Bambang 
Hendarsono and State Intelligence Agency chief Syamsir 
Siregar.  Coordinating Minister Widodo had visited the sites 
earlier today to survey damage.  Mission has offered support 
to Indonesian officials through law enforcement channels. 
The DCM expressed our solidarity and condolences to senior 
officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU). 
Senior DEPLU official Ambassador Retno was grateful for our 
offer of solidarity and law enforcement assistance and 
expressed sympathy for the injured Americans.  The 
Presidential Palace also thanked us.

INTERNATIONAL REACTION 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Australian Prime Minister Rudd condemned the bomb 
attacks as "murderous and barbaric terrorist acts."  He said 
that Australia stood ready to assist Indonesia.  The 
Manchester United soccer team from the UK was supposed to 
stay at the Ritz Carlton Hotel during its Asian tour, but has 
canceled its plans to travel in Indonesia.  Despite the 
attacks at the hotels, Indonesia is generally regarded as a 
safe place to live and do business.  The last major terrorist 
incident in Indonesia occurred in 2005.  The Marriott hotel 
had been the target of an August 2003 bomb blast, which 
killed 12 people. 
 
MISSION RECOMMENDATION 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Mission has passed the Secretary's remarks 
condemning the attacks to the Presidential Palace and DEPLU. 
They have expressed their appreciation for the remarks.  We 
also understand that President Obama and President Yudhoyono 
may have a phone call on July 23rd.  If it is possible to 
accelerate this phone call, Indonesia would welcome such a 
message of solidarity.  We recommend that the Department draw 
on the draft press guida.QbcQ=$Ym$QQk1QQican citizens are known to be 
among the injured. 
 
-- We are unaware of an American fatalities at this moment. 
 
-- None of the American victims sustained life-threatening 
injuries.  All have received medical treatment and some have 
been medically evacuated to Singapore for additional medical 
attention. 
 
-- The U.S. Embassy sent consular officers to the scene of 
the explosions as well as to Jakarta area hospitals to assist 
U.S. citizen victims. 
 
-- The U.S. Embassy issued a warden message to all registered 
U.S. citizens in Indonesia informing them of the incident and 
encouraging them to inform interested parties of their 
well-being and to avoid the area where the explosions 
occurred. 
 
-- The United States condemns these senseless acts of 
violence and we extend our sympathies to the victims and 
families in this tragic attack and to the people and 
Government of Indonesia. 
 
-- We have offered to provide assistance if requested by the 
Government of Indonesia.
