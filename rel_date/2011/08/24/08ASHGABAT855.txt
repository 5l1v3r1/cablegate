¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The First Caspian Sea Initiative meeting, 
held in Ashgabat on June 24-26, gave Caspian littoral states 
a good opportunity to discuss the counternarcotics challenges 
their countries face.  While the attendance of a Turkmen 
deputy prime minister at the opening conveyed the 
government's high-level support for the event, the country's 
presentation largely resembled similar presentations it made 
in the past.  However, other countries -- Iran and Azerbaijan 
-- gave much more detailed presentations, complete with 
statistics and admissions that government statistics were 
inaccurate.  (NOTE:  Post will send a CD-Rom containing all 
presentations to INL.  END NOTE.)  A donors' roundtable held 
at Post following the conference led to discussion of 
problems that donors are facing and some possible solutions. 
Donors and host-government officials alike noted and 
appreciated the participation of an officer from DEA's 
Bishkek office.  Post encourages DEA to continue to build its 
relationship with the State Counternarcotics Service through 
frequent visits and holding training programs in and outside 
of Turkmenistan, until Turkmenistan feels the level of trust 
necessary to undertake joint operations.  END SUMMARY. 
 
HIGH-LEVEL TURKMEN GOVERNMENT SUPPORT 
 
¶3.  (U) In a sign of top-level Turkmen support, Deputy 
Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Maysa Yazmuhammedova 
opened the First International Meeting on Illicit Drug 
Trafficking at Sea Ports, conducted under the UN Office on 
Drugs and Crime's (UNODC) Paris Pact Initiative on June 24. 
UNODC initially planned for the meeting to last three days, 
but agreed on June 20 to shorten the session to one and a 
half days at the government's request.  Delegations from 
Caspian Sea Initiative member countries -- Iran, Kazakhstan, 
Russia, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan -- and members of the 
diplomatic corps and Turkmen law-enforcement officials 
attended a drug burn on June 26.  The conference closed later 
on June 26 with a discussion of the member countries' 
suggested improvements to the draft Caspian Sea Initiative 
Action Plan.  (NOTE:  Embassy received a CD-ROM with all 
powerpoint presentations and will send it to INL via pouch. 
END NOTE.) 
 
¶4.  (U) The action plan's strategic objectives include: 
 
-- Enhance drug- and crime-related data collection and 
analysis capacity in each Caspian Sea state; 
 
-- Promote drug- and crime-related information and 
intelligence exchanges among Caspian Sea states; 
 
-- Assist the Caspian Sea states to strengthen maritime 
cargo, passenger, and vessel control in sea ports; and 
 
-- Support security and stability activities by promoting a 
common counternarcotics agenda, law-enforcement cooperation 
and coordination in the Caspian Sea region. 
 
MEMBER STATES' PRESENTATIONS:  AZERBAIJAN 
 
¶5.  (SBU) During the conference, member countries and the 
 
ASHGABAT 00000855  002 OF 003 
 
 
Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Centre 
(CARICC), UN Environmental Programme, and the World Customs 
Organization made presentations.  The Azeri delegation 
admitted that the real number of drug addicts in their 
country is higher than official figures suggest, but did not 
specify the real number.  The Azeris also stated that growing 
drug abuse in their country is the main source for HIV/AIDS 
transmission in Azerbaijan. 
 
IRAN MAKES INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION, WITH STATISTICS 
 
¶6.  (SBU) A large and well-organized Iranian delegation 
presented plenty of statistics in its slideshow, including: 
 
-- Two million people are drug addicts in Iran, including 1.2 
million regular users and 800,000 casual users; 
 
-- Just under 17,000 people are afflicted with HIV; 
 
-- Drug addicts primarily use opium, heroin, and hashish, 
with synthetic drug use on the rise; 
 
-- Iran spends $1 billion annually for "supply control," 
including border control and interdiction. 
 
IRAN ASKS RUSSIA FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, CLARIFICATION 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The Russian delegation admitted that its border 
personnel seized only a small amount of drugs imported into 
the country.  An Iranian representative asked via which 
routes drugs enter Russia (besides through Iran), and the 
Russia delegate stated that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are 
active transit areas.  Following this, an Azeri envoy said 
that Iran violates conventions through its attempts to 
extradite its citizens a month after they have been convicted 
of trafficking crimes. 
 
UK TO END COUNTERNARCOTICS PROGRAMS IN TURKMENISTAN 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Following the conference's completion, the main 
international counternarcotics donors in Ashgabat -- UNODC, 
OSCE, and the UK, U.S. and Turkish Embassies -- met at a 
post-sponsored roundtable to discuss improving coordination 
of donor activities.  UK Embassy DCM George Scott announced 
that the UK is ceasing its counternarcotics programs in 
Turkmenistan because the Foreign Office has determined that 
narcotics sold in the UK are not trafficked through 
Turkmenistan.  However, the UK Embassy can still support 
counternarcotics projects under the banner of "good 
governance."  Scott asked for any evidence that shows that 
drugs trafficked through Turkmenistan end up in Great Britain 
to help strengthen the Embassy's case in asking for 
resumption of counternarcotics funds. 
 
UNODC'S OBSERVATIONS 
 
¶9.  (SBU) UNODC's Ercan Saka said that within CARICC, 
Turkmenistan had largely been a receiver of information, 
rather than an information donor.  However, he added, 
Turkmenistan is starting to share results.  Saka encouraged 
donors to support Turkmenistan's drug control agency, the 
State Counternarcotics Service, and suggested that sending 
officials on study tours would support their exposure to 
international best practices.  UNODC wants to work on a 
project encouraging cross-border cooperation between Afghan 
 
ASHGABAT 00000855  003 OF 003 
 
 
and Turkmen officials at the Imamnazar border crossing 
checkpoint, and is waiting to see if the State Customs 
Service supports the idea.  UNODC is also urging 
Turkmenistan's State Counternarcotics Commission to release 
seizure data.  Saka said that the Iranian delegation 
volunteered to host the next Caspian Sea Initiative meeting, 
and that some countries -- in particular, Iran -- expressed 
concern at this Caspian Sea Initiative meeting over sharing 
data with all Paris Pact partners. 
 
OTHER DONORS EXCHANGE IMPRESSIONS 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Hakan Chengiz of the Turkish Embassy was not 
prepared to discuss specific training programs sponsored by 
the Turkish government, but agreed to furnish a list later in 
the interest of enhancing coordination among donors.  Donors 
agreed that, while the State Counternarcotics Service's head 
seems to be willing to work with the international community, 
this willingness to engage does not extend to lower levels. 
Donors discussed possible strategies for addressing 
lower-level blocks, including holding a UNODC-coordinated 
meeting with government officials in the UN building.  Saka 
emphasized the importance of picking out key partners in the 
government and encouraging them to feel a sense of ownership 
of their own projects.  U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
Special Agent William Gustafson said that although many 
Central Asian drug-control agencies ask for significant 
amounts of technical equipment, training is more important in 
stopping narcotics trafficking.  Gustafson finds it positive 
that even though Turkmenistan is also asking for plenty of 
equipment, the government is focusing on establishing a 
training center as one of its primary needs, and he urged 
donors to support the training center (Ref A).  Noting that a 
prison destruction that conference participants had been 
forced to attend (Ref B) had nothing to do with 
counternarcotics and stating that it had been a waste of time 
for Caspian Sea Initiative meeting participants to attend 
this event, George Scott added that Turkmenistan's officials 
need guidance on how to promote more positive public 
relations. 
 
¶11.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Post recognizes DEA's disappointment 
that State Counternarcotics Service chief Col. Murad Islamov 
is more focused on equipment and training than on conducting 
joint investigations with the DEA.  Nevertheless, we 
encourage DEA to continue to build its relationship with the 
State Counternarcotics Service through frequent visits and 
holding training programs in and outside of Turkmenistan, 
until Turkmenistan feels the level of trust necessary to 
undertake joint operations.  END COMMENT.
