Commentaries: 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶8.  (U)  The President of Saladdin University, Dr. Mohammed Sadiq, 
gave an interview to the KDP-run Khabat newspaper in which he said 
the greatest barrier to improving the educational system in the 
Kurdistan Region is the lack of freedom on university campuses and 
lack of openness in government decisions affecting higher education. 
 Criticizing a 2004 Kurdistan National Assembly decision to expand 
the number of departments and course offerings in KRG universities, 
he said, "These colleges have been opened with no plans.  The 
University does not have professors in all these fields."  He 
continued, "No one asked for advice from the University when the 
Higher Education law was issued, and it has a direct impact on the 
University."  He said he regrets that he only had one opportunity to 
meet with the Minister of Higher Education to discuss the law.  He 
concluded that he is now cooperating with the Ministry on a 
development plan sponsored by USAID.
