SUBJECT: SINGAPORE ISSUES STRONGER STATEMENT ON BURMA 
 
REF: SINGAPORE 1782 
 
¶1. (SBU) One day after we urged the Singapore MFA to do more 
on Burma (reftel), the DCM had the opportunity to ask 
Southeast Asia Director (D-G equivalent) Peter Tan for the 
GOS' latest thinking on the evolving situation.  Tan said 
that in light of reports that the government crackdown had 
resulted in at least one death and scores of injuries, the 
MFA had felt compelled to issue another, more forceful, 
statement today saying Singapore was "deeply troubled and 
concerned" over the use of force to surpress demonstrations 
(full text in paragraph 2)."  Noting that the situation in 
Burma "affects all ASEAN countries," the statement urged 
authorities to "exercise utmost restraint."  Tan (and the MFA 
statement) underscored Singapore's strong support for the 
UN's role in defusing the situation in Burma.  The statement 
welcomed UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's decision to 
dispatch special envoy Ibrahim Gambari to Burma and called on 
the authorities to grant him "full access to all players." 
 
¶2. (U) Text of MFA Statement: 
 
Singapore is deeply troubled and concerned by reports that 
the demonstrations in Yangon have been suppressed by force. 
We urge the Myanmar authorities to exercise utmost restraint. 
 Singapore welcomes the decision of UN Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon to send Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari to Myanmar.  We 
fully support any initiative by the UN which would help 
defuse the situation. 
 
We urge the Myanmar authorities to admit Mr. Gambari into 
Myanmar and grant him full access to all players in Myanmar. 
A peaceful resolution to the situation in Myanmar will 
require the cooperation and involvement of all parties, 
including the military. 
 
The situation in Myanmar affects all ASEAN countries.  We 
hope that the Myanmar authorities and all other parties in 
Myanmar will appreciate the broader implications of their 
actions on the region as a whole and act accordingly.  The UN 
offers the best hope for a peaceful resolution of the 
situation.  We call upon the Myanmar authorities to take 
advantage of Mr. Gambari's planned visit to defuse the 
situation. 
 
Currently in New York for the UN General Assembly session, 
Minister for Foreign Affairs George Yeo has applauded the 
decision by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to send Mr. 
Gambari on this mission.  He urged all parties in Myanmar to 
work towards national reconciliation.  He had spoken to Mr. 
Gambari in New York and assured him of Singapore's full 
support. 
 
We understand that the UN Security Council intends to conduct 
consultations on the situation in Myanmar.  In his capacity 
as the current Chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, Mr. 
Yeo is currently consulting with Foreign Minister Hassan 
Wirajuda of Indonesia, which is now a non-permanent member of 
the UN Security Council, and other ASEAN Members.
