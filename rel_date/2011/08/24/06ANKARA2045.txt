¶1. (SBU) As the constroversy over the Iranian nuclear program 
continues and many in Turkey become increasingly anxious 
about next steps, we thought it useful to review the basic 
elements of Turkey's relations with this troublesome 
neighbor.  What follows is a snapshot overview of Turkey's 
interaction with Iran in a variety of fields.

Tabriz and Urumiye.

Istanbul, Erzurum, and Trabzon.

organizations, including the UN, OIC, Economic Cooperation 
Organization (ECO), and Development Eight (D8).

National Security, and Defense Affairs Committee Chair 
Aladdin Boroujerdi visited Turkey.

the border every year, connecting Turkey to Iran, Central

ever six months.

Turkish authorities.

mostly consumer goods and processed materials. 
-- About three-quarters of the trade is Turkish imports from 
Iran, mostly crude oil and natural gas.

since 1995 when the two countries only traded goods and 
services totalling about $1 billion.
