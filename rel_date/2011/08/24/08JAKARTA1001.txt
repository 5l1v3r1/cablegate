¶1.  (SBU) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- 
Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Pol/C reviewed with the GOI points 
related to the May 25 UN/ASEAN Burma Donor Conference.  GOI 
contacts took the points on board.  Meanwhile, a National 
Democratic Institute (NDI)-sponsored photographic exhibit 
focused on Burma kicked off in Jakarta.  NDI is also 
sponsoring the visit of several Burmese monks, who are 
telling the story of the regime's brutality.  Mission worked 
closely with the organizers of the program, which concludes 
May 23.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DEPLOYING USG POINTS 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Pol/C delivered reftel demarche to Ade Sukendar, 
Deputy Director for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU).  Though recently there 
have been tentative steps in the right direction, Pol/C 
underscored the need for the upcoming UN-ASEAN donor 
conference to focus on ensuring greater access for 
humanitarian aid.  We believe that it is premature to 
transition from recovery to reconstruction when over 
three-quarters of those severely affected by the cyclone have 
yet to receive any aid.  We welcome ASEAN's initiative to set 
up a mechanism to coordinate assistance to Burma and express 
our hope that this mechanism will facilitate increased access 
to disaster areas.  Sukendar took the USG points on board. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) To give the points the widest dissemination 
possible, we also provided them to Djoko Susilo, an 
Indonesian legislator active on Burma issues; to the Center 
for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank which 
has often advised the GOI on Burma; and to the Indonesian 
National Disaster Management Coordinating Body (BAKORNAS). 
 
NDI PRESSES BURMA ISSUES 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Also on the Burma front, the National Democratic 
Institute and a coalition of Indonesian NGOs today launched a 
photographic exhibit on Burma and the Jakarta visit of 
several Burmese monks.  The monks will meet a range of 
Indonesian leaders and will open the photo exhibit, which 
highlights the situation in Burma.  Mission worked closely 
with the organizers of the program, which concludes May 23. 
We will report more fully on the photo exhibit and the monks' 
visit septel.
