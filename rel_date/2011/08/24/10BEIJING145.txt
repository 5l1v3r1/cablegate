SUBJECT: JANUARY 12 MFA PRESS BRIEFING 
 
¶1. Key points at the January 12 MFA press briefing were: 
 
-- China believes sanctions "cannot fundamentally resolve" the 
Iranian nuclear issue. 
 
-- China opposes the sheltering, by any country, of Guantanamo 
Uighurs because they are "members of a terrorist group."  Doing so 
would contravene UNCSR 1373 obligations on all countries. 
 
-- China opposes official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan and 
urges the U.S. to treat the transit of Taiwan President Ma 
"prudently." 
 
-- China emphasized the "gravity" of arms sales to Taiwan and urged 
the U.S. to take measures to safeguard the bilateral relationship. 
 
Iran Nuclear Issue 
------------------ 
 
¶2.  At the January 12 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, MFA spokesperson Jiang Yu was asked about U.S. media 
reports that the USG had developed contingency plans to deal with 
Iran's nuclear facilities.  Jiang replied that all parties should 
work towards a peaceful resolution through diplomatic negotiations. 
In the current circumstances all parties should support dialogue and 
seek an appropriate long-term resolution, she said.  Following up, 
Al-Jazeera asked whether the upcoming P5+1 meeting on Iran would 
include discussion of new sanctions and what China's position would 
be on such sanctions.  Jiang replied that "sanctions cannot 
fundamentally resolve the issue."  In a separate question about a 
media report that a Taiwan firm had sold controlled nuclear 
equipment to Iran at China's request, Jiang said she was aware of 
the reports but had no further information. 
 
China Opposes Transfer of Guantanamo Uighurs 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Voice of America asked for China's reaction to recent press 
reports suggesting that Switzerland may accept some Uighur 
Guantanamo detainees.  Jiang said that China opposed the transfer of 
Chinese Uighurs to any third country because they are "members of a 
terrorist group."  According to UN Security Council Resolution 1373, 
all UN member states should refuse shelter to those who have 
committed terrorist acts, Jiang said.  China reminded all countries, 
including Switzerland, of their obligation to respect this 
commitment. 
 
Ma Ying-jeou Transit - Arms Sales 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4.  A reporter noted that Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou would soon 
transit the U.S. during an upcoming visit to Honduras.  Jiang said 
that China opposed any official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan 
and urged the U.S. to abide by its commitments under the three Joint 
Communiques and to handle the issue "in a prudent way."  China also 
wished to underscore the gravity of its concerns about U.S. arms 
sales to Taiwan and urged the U.S. to take steps to safeguard the 
bilateral relationship, Jiang said. 
 
China's "Anti-Missile" Test 
--------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Asked whether there was any link between China's recent 
"anti-missile test" and reports of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, Jiang 
said that on January 11, China had conducted a test of "anti-missile 
technology" within its territory.  The test had not left any debris 
in space and was of no threat to any spacecraft in orbit.  It was 
defensive in nature and not aimed at any country.  China's pursuit 
of a peaceful development path was in accordance with its right to 
preserve its territorial integrity, Jiang said. 
 
Korean Peninsula 
---------------- 
 
¶6.  ROK media outlet Kyodo asked whether China would support ROK 
participation in any future negotiations with North Korea on 
replacing the armistice with a peace treaty, as suggested by the 
January 11 DPRK statement.  China supported early resumption of the 
Six-Party Talks and implementation of the September 19 Joint 
Statement, Jiang replied, noting that safeguarding the peace and 
stability of the Korean Peninsula was in the interest of all 
relevant countries. 
 
PRC-India Territorial Conflicts 
------------------------------- 
 
BEIJING 00000145  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶7.  Regarding recent media reports on China-India border disputes, 
Jiang asserted that China and India were "friendly neighbors."  She 
said that a consensus had already been reached and that both sides 
would take concrete measures to peacefully resolve territorial 
disputes.  China would strictly abide by its commitments, Jiang 
said. 
 
Austrian Visit to China 
----------------------- 
 
¶8.  Jiang announced that, at the invitation of Hu Jintao, Austrian 
President Heinz Fischer will visit China January 19-22. 
 
Yang Jiechi to Japan 
-------------------- 
 
¶9.  At the invitation of Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada, 
Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi will travel to Japan January 
16-17 to participate in the 4th Forum for East Asia-Latin America 
Cooperation (FEALAC) Ministerial.
