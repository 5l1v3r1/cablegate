Main Stories: 
------------- 
Obama's June 3 visit to Saudi Arabia captures lead coverage in 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Quds and front page coverage in Al-Ayyam. 
All papers run lead photos of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia warmly 
welcoming President Obama in Riyadh. The papers quote King Abdullah 
saying, "I want to convey my wishes to the American people who are 
represented by a man who deserves to be in this position".  Obama 
met with King Abdullah and discussed means of reviving the peace 
process in the Middle East, papers report.  The papers also report 
that Obama's anticipated speech to the Muslim world will call on 
Arabs and Israelis to show seriousness about ending conflict.  Obama 
noted that many Israelis realize the importance of halting 
settlement activities and many Palestinians realize that they must 
make positive gestures towards Israel.  Obama noted that the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state would serve the 
interests of Israel as a Jewish state, according to coverage. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page coverage citing Wafa quoting a U.S. 
official stating that President Obama seeks to establish positive 
partnerships with Muslim countries focusing on cooperation in the 
fields of development, health, education and technology.  Al-Ayyam 
runs separate front page coverage citing AFP on Congressional 
Democrats criticizing Obama's statements regarding Israeli 
settlements in the West Bank because they represent a change in U.S. 
policy towards Israel. 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida run front page coverage citing AFP 
about 200 Israeli "right wing" protestors gathering on June 3 in 
front of the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem.  The gathering was 
in protest of President Obama's foreign policy which they perceive 
of as biased towards the Palestinians, according to coverage. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs a front page photo of protestors holding 
signs that read, "Barack Hussein Obama, No you Can't." 
 
All dailies run front page coverage citing AFP about Israel 
dismantling Rimonim checkpoint known as "Asira" in Nablus and the 
Birzeit checkpoint known as "Atara."  Papers highlight that 600 
checkpoints remain throughout the West Bank. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page coverage citing Wafa about the 
PLO's satisfaction with "positive remarks" made by President Obama 
regarding U.S. serious intent to re-launch a real peace process in 
the Middle East, beginning with a halt to settlements activities, 
including natural growth. 
 
Al-Ayyam ran its lead story under a banner headline highlighting a 
World Bank report noting that the Palestinian economy has suffered 
from the "many Israeli-imposed restrictions" during 2008.  The 
article emphasized that the, "strategic goal of an economically 
viable Palestinian state can only be achieved if the West Bank and 
Gaza are maintained as an integral economic entity." 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida run front page coverage citing 
Reuters quoting Israeli Defense Minister Barak noting that Israel 
can resolve its differences with the U.S. regarding West Bank 
settlements.  Barak continued that Israel supports Obama's 
initiative for a regional peace settlement, according to reporting. 
Barak also noted "We pledged to respect Israel's signed agreements 
with the U.S." but added that, "[President] Bush endorsed the 
building of new houses in settlements to accommodate natural 
growth."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Abdil Hamid Suwaylim commented in independent Al-Ayyam under the 
headline, "President Obama:  Is there really anything new?"(6/4): 
"Will the [Obama] Administration, which has involved itself in the 
[Palestinian] conflict's smallest details like never before, provide 
a comprehensive vision suitable for this phase [of the conflict]?... 
 Will this vision have to wait until a new [U.S.] relationship is 
formed with the Arab and Muslim worlds...? 
 
2) Independent Al-Quds editorialized in "Obama in Cairo," (6/4): 
"President Obama's visit to the region and his anticipated speech in 
Cairo today have captured great attention locally, regionally and 
internationally... It is worth noting that the President's tour does 
not include a visit to Israel..., but the more important thing is 
the selection of Cairo as the place from which the President is 
sending his message to the Muslim world.  This can only reemphasize 
the strategic and essential role of Cairo in the Arab and Muslim 
worlds."
