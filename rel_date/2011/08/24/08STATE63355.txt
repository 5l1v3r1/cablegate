¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassies, assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on license 050081672 for the 
export of CH-47 helicopter spare component parts to the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE).  Embassy is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to 
a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Concerns about Eurotradia 
International, foreign intermediate consignee. 
 
¶4. ACTION Abu Dhabi: Embassy is requested to make inquiries 
with appropriate host government officials to determine if 
the UAE Armed Forces Logistics Staff has received the CH-47 
helicopter spare component parts from Defense Technology 
Equipment, Inc. and that the articles are being used for the 
purpose stated on the license.  Export data indicates that 
items worth $146,800 shipped from the United States on March 
22, 2008.  Post is requested to contact the UAE MOD to verify 
receipt of this order.  UAE POC is Staff Colonel (Deputy 
Director, General Purchasing) Yahya Yousuf Abdulla Al 
Baloushi, Tel. No. 971-2-4414999, Purchase Order No. 
093447/02/MBS signed on November 20, 2007. 
END ACTION ABU DHABI 
 
ACTION Paris: The Department requests that Embassy conduct a 
site visit to Eurotradia International in order to provide an 
assessment of its business operations, on-site security, and 
general reliability as a recipient of United States Munitions

Monneray, Purchasing Manager, Tel. No. 33-(0)-1-40-76-20-01, 
Purchase Order No. 093447/02/MBS signed on November 20, 2007. 
 The following questions are offered as suggested guidance 
with Eurotradia International: 
 
Can Eurotradia International provide documentation from the 
UAE MOD establishing it as the end user of these items?  Does 
the company have an established, legitimate customer 
base to which it plans to sell these commodities?  Does the 
company keep proper, detailed records of its sales and 
customers?  Who are the company,s primary clients?  Does the 
company understand the restrictions 
on USML articles, particularly regarding re-export and 
retransfer? 
END ACTION PARIS
