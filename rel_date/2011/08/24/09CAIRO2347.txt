1.(SBU) Key Points: 
 
--Dr. Samir Refaey, the Minister of Health (MoH)'s executive 
director for disease surveillance, characterized Egypt as adequately 
prepared for an expected increase in H1N1 influenza cases in the 
next three months. 
 
--As of December 19, 2009, MoH has reported 6,847 confirmed H1N1 
cases with 93 fatalities. 
 
--MoH's National Severity Index - which measures influenza's impact 
on the country - has risen from normal to moderate conditions due to 
the rise in H1N1 cases and deaths. 
 
¶2. (U) ESTHoff met with Dr. Samir Refaey, MoH's executive director 
of disease surveillance, on December 21 to discuss GoE planning and 
preparation for the winter influenza season. 
Refaey is the MoH's point person on influenza issues and advises 
Health Minister Hatem El-Gabaly. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Refaey, MoH has confirmed 6,847 H1N1 cases 
with 89 fatalities as of December 19.  He noted that 80% of all 
cases have been reported in the last two months (November and 
December).  Refaey attributed this recent surge partly to the winter 
weather but also noted MoH has begun allowing privately-owned 
laboratories - and not just MoH facilities - to screen for H1N1. 
This has lead to an increase in influenza testing; MoH estimates 
that 60-70% of all confirmed H1N1 cases now come from private 
laboratory reporting. 
 
¶4. (SBU) MoH has raised the alert level for the National Severity 
Index, a tracking system that monitors influenza's impact on the 
country.  Refaey explained that the sharp increase in H1N1 cases 
coupled with a rise in the mortality rate (which now stands slightly 
above 1% for all confirmed cases) triggered the change from normal 
to moderate influenza conditions. (Note: In the color coded index, 
green corresponds to normal while yellow represents a moderate 
influenza situation.  End Note) 
 
¶5. (SBU)Noting that no country is ever completely ready, Refaey 
stated MoH is currently "satisfied with its preparations" for the 
winter influenza season.  He advised that MoH possesses 1 million 
doses of H1N1 vaccine, having received 450,000 doses earlier in the 
week.  MoH has instructed hospitals to increase space for intensive 
care units and the number of ventilators available for patients with 
more severe H1N1 symptoms.  Refaey also explained that MoH has 
stepped up its influenza media campaign, which encourages 
individuals to seek immediate treatment if they display 
influenza-like symptoms.  He noted this message has played a 
critical role in lowering the country's H5N1 (avian influenza) 
mortality rate, which stands at 10% for all confirmed cases this 
year (40 cases, resulting in 4 deaths), far below the global rate of 
66%.
