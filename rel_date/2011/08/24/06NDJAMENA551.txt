SUBJECT: CHAD: FOREIGN MINISTER CLARIFICATION ON REFUGEES 
 
REF: NDJAMENA 541 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a meeting April 17 with the Ambassador 
principally addressing political blockage in Chad (septel), 
Foreign Minister Ahmad Allam-mi provided clarification on 
Chad's announcement April 15 (reftel) that the international 
community had until the end of June to find a solution to the 
conflict in Darfur, otherwise it would have to find other 
countries to welcome the Darfur refugees. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Allam-mi said that Chad had not meant to suggest 
that the refugees would be expelled to Sudan. Chad would not 
expel the refugees anywhere, but it might be necessary for 
the international community to find other countries willing 
to receive the refugees because it was becoming increasingly 
difficult for Chad, unaided, to protect the refugees.  It was 
becoming difficult for Chad even to assure the security of 
its own citizens along the border, who were now subject to 
constant attacks by the janjaweed.  It was possible that 
Sudan's minions would attack the camps, in search of Sudanese 
rebels.  Tamas and Arabs in Darfur were being recruited to 
combat the Zaghawas.  With the increasing instability in the 
area of the refugee camps, humanitarian workers had begun 
leaving at the first sign of trouble.  Chad had its 
obligations in reference to the refugees, but the 
international community also had its obligations.  It was 
essential rapidly to put a UN force on the border, but 
initiatives by the UN were repeatedly undermined by the 
attitude of the Chinese. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Ambassador asked whether the government 
intended to make this clarification public, to which Allam-mi 
gave no reply, except to say he was providing various 
interlocutors with the same message.  He said that the 
government's announcement had been necessary to wake up the 
international community, which had not grasped the gravity of 
the peril facing Chad and the refugees.  The Ambassador said 
it was hardly appropriate to speak of inattention, when the 
United States had provided millions of dollars worth of 
assistance for the refugee camps and eastern Chad.  Allam-mi 
said that the issue was lack of understanding of the security 
threat.
