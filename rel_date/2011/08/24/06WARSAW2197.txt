REF: SECSTATE 169257 
 
(SBU) Political Counselor, joined by New Zealand Deputy Head 
of Mission Maureen O'Meeghan, and Australian Third Secretary 
Amy Doidge, delivered reftel demarche October 13 to Miroslaw 
Luczka, Acting Director of the MFA's UN Department, urging 
that Poland oppose the adoption of the current text of the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples when it comes 
before the UN General Assembly this fall.  Luczka listened to 
points outlined in reftel, but indicated, as had MFA Under 
Secretary Janusz Stanczyk in a demarche earlier this year, 
 
SIPDIS 
that Poland had no strong interest in the resolution, and 
would follow EU consensus.  PolCouns argued that Poland, as a 
supporter of human rights and of UN structures, had an 
interest in preventing the adoption of such a flawed 
document, especially given its apparent elevation of group 
rights over individual human rights.  The New Zealand and 
Australian Embassy representatives also urged that Poland 
consider that the document would in fact do nothing to 
advance the rights of indigenous peoples.  Luczka reiterated 
the strong support in many EU capitals for the document, 
indicating that Poland would likely not break with EU 
consensus or work to change it.  He promised, however, to 
pass on the demarche to senior officials and provide us with 
feedback.
