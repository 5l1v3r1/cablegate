REF: STATE 11928 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) PolOff met with German MFA Deputy Office Director 
for the Balkans Mark Bogdahn February 12 to discuss the 
points in Ref. A.  Bogdahn thanked us for sharing our talking 
points and noted that Germany continues to work actively to 
convince other nations to recognize Kosovo, including a 
number of countries on our target list.  Bogdahn said however 
that Germany planned its next round of demarches once EULEX 
is fully operational -- sometime around the end of March.  He 
also noted that MFA State Secretary Reinhard Silberberg plans 
to attend Tuesday's Kosovo Day reception in Berlin.
