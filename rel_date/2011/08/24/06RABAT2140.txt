¶1. (SBU) In a November 17 meeting, Poloff raised with the 
Moroccan Government USG concerns about the text of a draft 
resolution condemning recent Israeli actions in Gaza, and 
urged that the Moroccan delegation in New York vote against 
it.   Drawing from reftel points, poloff outlined the U.S. 
view that the draft is imbalanced and one-sided and does not 
contribute to the cause of Israeli-Palestinian peace. 
 
¶2. (SBU) United Nations Division Chief Azzedine Farhane 
responded that if the resolution had been drafted by the Arab 
Group, Morocco would be hard-pressed to disassociate itself 
from it, but would work within Arab Group and other caucus 
discussions to moderate the text.  Noting the short 
time-frame Farhane also encouraged USUN officers to raise 
directly with the Moroccan delegation U.S. concerns about the 
resolution.
