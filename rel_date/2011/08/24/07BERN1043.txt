SUBJECT: SWISS APPRECIATE INFORMATION ON NEW IRAN 
DESIGNATIONS, BUT CAN'T ACT WITHOUT A UNSCR 
 
REF: SECSTATE 148605 
 
¶1.  Emboff delivered reftel points and non-paper to Dieter 
Cavalleri, Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, Director, 
International Law Division, on October 26.  Cavalleri said he 
would immediately provide the relevant Swiss ministries with 
the information and would also provide the Swiss Federal 
Banking Commission with the details.  He caveated the Swiss 
"action" by reminding Emboffs that the Swiss government can't 
implement the new USG sanctions without a United Nations 
Security Council Resolution mandating international action. 
 
¶2.  Cavalleri noted that while the Swiss government is 
precluded from acting, Switzerland's two largest banks (UBS 
and Credit Suisse) and the Swiss Bankers Association are free 
to implement the new USG Iran sanctions.  He added that UBS 
and Credit Suisse likely have the new entities in their 
screening software already.
