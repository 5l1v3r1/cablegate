¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Russian Federal 
Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance 
Service (VPSS) informed via official letter on 
November 14, 2008, that another U.S. poultry 
plant (P-13556) and pork plant (#17564) will be 
delisted as of November 24, 2008.  According to 
the VPSS letter, routine tests revealed the 
presence of tetracycline in a shipment of 
chicken quarters and salmonella in a shipment 
of boneless pork jowls from these plants.  The 
letter requests that the USDA Food Safety and 
Inspection Service (FSIS) conduct an 
investigation into how product contaminated 
with residue and salmonella found their way 
into shipments to Russia.  The original scanned 
copy of the VPSS letter and courtesy 
translation were sent to FSIS on November 16, 
¶2008.  An informal embassy translation of the 
letter follows.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT: 
Moscow, November 14, 2008 
 
Mr. William James, the Deputy Administrator of 
the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) 
 
 
Dear Mr. James, 
 
The Federal Service for Veterinary and 
Phytosanitary Surveillance extends its respect 
to the Food Safety and Inspection Service 
(FSIS), USDA. 
 
Antibiotic tetracycline was detected in a 
shipment of chicken quarters imported from the 
U.S. to the Russian Federation during 
monitoring tests of the residues of prohibited 
and harmful substances (lab test results #2408 
of October 22, 2008). The product was 
manufactured at the U.S. establishment #P-13556 
(veterinary certificates #RFA-049567, RFA- 
049490 of August 29, 2008). 
 
Salmonella was found in a shipment of boneless 
pork (jowl) (lab results #8777/B-6730 of 
October 21, 2008; #9111/B-6989 of October 29, 
2008). The product was manufactured at the U.S. 
establishment #17564 (veterinary certificate # 
RFP-079549 of August 11, 2008). 
 
The cases mentioned above constitute the 
violations of requirements of the negotiated 
veterinary certificate for export of poultry 
and pork to the Russian Federation. 
 
In this connection, VPSS informs you about 
imposing temporary restrictions on the import 
of products from the mentioned establishments 
to the Russian Federation that come in force on 
November 24, 2008 and asks you to conduct an 
investigation to reveal causes of the presence 
of the medicinal residuals and Salmonella in 
veterinary products. VPSS asks you to take 
measures for preventing the shipments of 
products to the Russian Federation that do not 
comply with the requirements of the Russian 
Federation and the negotiated veterinary 
certificates. Please inform VPSS about the 
results of investigation and the preventative 
measures. 
 
Mr. James, let me assure you of my highest 
esteem,
