¶1. (U) THE SLOVAK MFA JUNE 9 ISSUED A PUBLIC STATEMENT 
WELCOMING THE RESOLUTION ON IRAQ APPROVED BY THE UN SECURITY 
COUNCIL.  THE STATEMENT CALLED THE RESOLUTION A DECISIVE 
STEP TOWARDS NORMALIZING THE SITUATION IN IRAQ AND RENEWING 
STABILITY AND DEMOCRACY.  "STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF THE UN 
    REPRESENTS A SPECIFIC PLATFORM ON THE PART OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S EFFORTS TO ASSIST THE IRAQI 
GOVERNMENT IN FACING THE CHALLENGES OF NEW POLITICAL 
PROCESSES," READS THE MFA STATEMENT IN PART. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SLOVAKIA'S FIRST CASUALTIES IN IRAQ ON JUNE 8 
INSPIRED SOME POLITICIANS TO REITERATE CALLS FOR A 
DISCUSSION ON WHEN THE SLOVAK MISSION IN IRAQ WILL END. 
NONETHELESS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS REMAINED FIRMLY COMMITTED TO 
KEEPING SLOVAK TROOPS IN IRAQ AS LONG AS THEY ARE NEEDED. 
PRIVATELY, MFA OFFICIALS EXPRESSED GREAT SATISFACTION THAT 
THE UNSC RESOLUTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY, LENDING FURTHER 
LEGITIMACY TO SLOVAK FOREIGN POLICY TOWARDS IRAQ.
