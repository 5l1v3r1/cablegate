SUBJECT: MAURITIUS, FRANCE, TROMELIN AND CHAGOS/DIEGO GARCIA 
 
 ¶1. Tromelin is a low, flat, 200-acre scrub-covered island 
between Mauritius and Madagascar which is uninhabited (except 
for a few technicians at a weather station) and has no 
harbors.  It is currently a French territory governed from 
Reunion -- but is claimed by both Mauritius and France 
(Mauritius argues that it was occupied illegally by France in 
1954). The island itself is of little consequence but it is 
surrounded by a 110,000 square-mile maritime Exclusive 
Economic Zone (EEZ), contiguous to that of Reunion. 
 
¶2. For the last year, Mauritius and France have been 
discussing the possible economic, environmental and 
scientific "joint management" of Tromelin, focusing 
particularly on protection of the marine environment and 
measures against illegal fishing in the EEZ,  The proposed 
accord will last for five years. The next meeting of the two 
sides will take place in Mauritius February 4.  Mauritius is 
insisting that any "joint-management" accord will not affect 
the Mauritian claim of sovereignty over the island.  Prime 
Minister Rangoolam has announced his intention to visit 
Tromelin later this year. 
 
¶3. COMMENT: The polite Mauritius-France discussions regarding 
Tromelin are in marked contrast to the frosty diplomatic 
chill hanging over the Mauritius-UK negotiations concerning 
Chagos/Diego Garcia (islands similarly claimed by Mauritius). 
 The UK last year unilaterally proposed a vast Marine 
Protected Area surrounding the Chagos, which Mauritius has 
strongly opposed (arguing that any such proposal should be 
the result of direct bilateral negotiations between Mauritius 
and the UK). END COMMENT.
