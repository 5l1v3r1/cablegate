SUBJECT: KARBALA: SERMON FOCUSES ON THE CONSTITUTION AND SECURITY 
 
 
¶1. (U) This is a PRT Karbala cable. 
 
¶2. (U) Again this week Sayed Ahmed al-Safi, Head of the Al Abbas 
shrine office, conducted the Friday sermon at Karbala's 
al-Husain shrine.  Sheikh Abdul Mehdi al-Karbalae reportedly 
headed the recent meeting of the Karbala Provincial security 
body, but he was not at the Friday sermon.  The message of this 
sermon was directed both to citizens and to government 
officials.  To the former, al-Safi encouraged respect for the 
constitution and to the later, a more proactive parliament and 
security effort.  Local media coverage included Karbala Radio, 
and the following television channels; Karbala, Al-Iraqya, 
Al-Furat, and Al-Salam. 
 
¶3. (U) The sermon highlighted three points; respect for the 
constitution, outdated Iraqi laws that are inconsistent with the 
new government, and security.  Al-Safi first asked the people to 
honor the constitution explaining that if applied it would 
benefit the whole of Iraq.  He then directed the remainder of 
his sermon towards the government.  Calling on them to be 
empathetic, al-Safi encouraged the central and provincial 
governments to compete with one another to provide the public 
with the best possible services.   He also highlighted that the 
legal code of Iraq has not consistently been updated to reflect 
the change in government since the fall of the regime.  Al-Safi 
chastised the parliament for this, accusing them of being slow 
to enact new legislation.  The final topic began with al-Safi 
praising a recent raid by Iraqi police near the Syrian border 
that resulted in the capture of 200 suicide-bomber belts.  He 
speculated that the target of those suicide belts were the holy 
places in Iraq including the shrines in Karbala.  He called on 
the government to take a serious stand regarding security. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: Al-Safi tirelessly reminds the government of 
their responsibility.  Otherwise, the sermon was relatively 
calm.  PRT Karbala does not have a more expeditious mechanism of 
transmitting the audio version of the sermon on the day it is 
given, therefore a historical record is available at the
