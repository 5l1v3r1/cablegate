SUBJECT:  German Reactions to U.S. Proposals on "Global

REF: STATE 093894, BERLIN 001134 
 
¶1. (U)  Summary:  While supporting the results of the G-8 
meeting in Washington during the week of September 14, 
Germany prefers to maintain the G-8 response to a global 
partnership on food security in line with agreements reach 
by the Agricultural Ministers in l'Aquilla in April. 
However, Germany will stand in the way of consensus.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (U)  In follow-up to the G8 meeting in Washington DC on 
September 14-15 regarding world food security, Deputy 
Director for International Affairs in the German Federal 
Ministry of Agriculture Dr. Hans-Christoph Eiden (who was 
also present in WDC) provided some additional detail to the 
German position.  Eiden said that Germany would support the 
summary paper prepared during the WDC meeting.  He pointed 
out that Germany is in favor of the idea of a Global 
Partnership as agreed in l'Aquilla.  However, Germany is 
less interested in a 'Global Partnering for Food Security' 
as proposed by the United States.  Eiden expressed sympathy 
for the position of developing countries who want to be 
treated as equals in the process instead of implementing a 
system of leaders and followers. 
 
¶3. (U)  Eiden said that Germany is of the opinion that the 
existing structures at the United Nations and at the World 
Bank should be utilized for food security programs since 
this is also in the interest of developing countries. 
Germany is not interested in a new special fund for food 
security.  Eiden said that there is already enough money 
available to perform the needed programs.  He believes that 
it is better to make use of existing structures regardless 
of their deficiencies rather than implementing new systems. 
 
 
¶4. (U)  However, Eiden also made clear that Germany is open 
to compromise for the sake of progress.  Germany would not 
be interested in blocking any progress and insisting on the 
use of certain structures to secure and improve world food 
supplies.  Eiden was not prepared to further elaborate about 
the German position in the next meetings in New York during 
the UN General Assembly.
