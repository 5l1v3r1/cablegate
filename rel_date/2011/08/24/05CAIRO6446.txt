Poloff contacted Benha Electronics CEO Abdel Fattah Ahmed El 
Sehly to establish the bona fides of the company per reftel 
request.  Mr. El Sehly confirmed that the company is a 
manufacturer of military equipment and also places orders for 
the MOD.  He said that he was not familiar with an order for 
radio handsets for the Ministry of Defense; however, the 
International Imports Manager, Mohamed El Toukhy, confirmed 
that the company had placed an order for 400 radio handsets 
for the MOD with Setronics.  El Toukhy said Benha put a hold 
on the order on August 22 because of unresolved payment 
questions.  He also noted that he does not know what type of 
communications equipment the handsets will be used with. 
According to the company profile, Benha Electronics is a 
state-owned manufacturer of civil and military electronic 
equipment, including computers.
