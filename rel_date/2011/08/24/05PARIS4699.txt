(A) SUBJECTS COVERED IN TODAY'S REPORT: 
 
¶1. G-8: CLIMATE CHANGE - AFRICA 
¶2. CENTRAL ASIA: SUMMIT IN KAZAKSTAN 
 
B) SUMMARY OF COVERAGE: 
 
EXCEPT FOR THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC PRESS, EVERY OTHER 
OUTLET DEVOTES ITS FRONT-PAGE TO THE 2012 OLYMPICS AS "FRANCE 
HOLDS ITS BREATH" (LE PARISIEN) AND WAITS FOR THIS MORNING'S 
VOTE IN SINGAPORE. CATHOLIC LA CROIX'S LITERARY WINK HEADLINE 
READS: "IS PARIS WINNING?" FOR LE FIGARO IT IS "THE HOUR OF 
TRUTH FOR PARIS," WHILE LIBERATION HEADLINES: "PARIS HOLDING 
TO THE (OLYMPIC) RINGS." MANY EDITORIALS ARE DEVOTED TO 
FRANCE'S CANDIDACY AND ALL IT HAS RIDING ON THE FINAL CHOICE. 
FOR JEAN-MICHEL THENARD OF LIBERATION, THE QUESTION IS: "AFTER 
TEN YEARS OF `CHIRACDOM,' WHY DOES FRANCE HAVE SO LITTLE 
CONFIDENCE IN ITSELF THAT IT NEEDS THE OLYMPIC MIRROR TO 
ADMIRE ITSELF?" THE CHIRAC-BLAIR CONFRONTATION OVER THE GAMES 
CARRIES OVER INTO THE SECOND MAJOR STORY OF TODAY, THE G-8. 
 
RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO TITLES: "G-8: TONY BLAIR IMPOSES HIS 
PRIORITIES," WHILE LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION TITLES ON A FRONT- 
PAGE SIDE COLUMN: "AFRICA, A SPECIAL GUEST OF THE G-8." 
ECONOMIC LES ECHOS CARRIES A FRONT-PAGE PHOTO OF WORLD BANK 
PRESIDENT PAUL WOLFOWITZ AND TITLES: "HELPING AFRICA AND 
CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE G-8 MENU." INSIDE, A ONE-PAGE REPORT 
INCLUDES A STORY ON "LONDON'S ATTEMPTS TO LOWER EXPECTATIONS 
ON A MAJOR AGREEMENT." IN A SEPARATE ARTICLE, NICOLAS 
MADELAINE, THE WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, QUOTES WORLD BANK 
PRESIDENT PAUL WOLFOWITZ: " LIBERALIZING TRADE MUST BE PUT AT 
THE TOP OF THE LIST OF PRIORITIES. THE PEOPLE OF AFRICA MUST 
BE ABLE TO EXPORT THE PRODUCTS OF THEIR LABOR, IN PARTICULAR 
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. DEVELOPMENT MUST BE CONCEIVED IN THE 
WIDE SENSE. AID IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT, GOOD GOVERNANCE 
MUST BE ENCOURAGED. SO THAT THE LOCAL CLIMATE IS FAVORABLE TO 
PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENTS." REPORTS EMPHASIZE BLAIR'S 
POSITION OF STRENGTH GOING IN THE G-8, CHIRAC'S WEAKENED 
POSITION AFTER THE EU REFERENDUM AND THE FACT THAT HE 
CONTINUES TO OPPOSE PRESIDENT BUSH ON KYOTO. POPULAR RIGHT-OF- 
CENTER FRANCE SOIR TITLES "THE G-8 DEVOTED TO CLIMATE CHANGE" 
AND OPTS FOR A TWO-PAGE REPORT ON THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT ON 
FRANCE IN THE COMING YEARS. (SEE PART C) 
 
LE FIGARO CARRIES A REPORT ON THE SUMMIT ON CENTRAL ASIA IN 
ASTANA, KAZAKSTAN, (SEE PART C) 
 
LE FIGARO CARRIES AN OP-ED PENNED BY KOFI ANNAN TITLED "RE- 
ENFORCING THE UN." ON THE OPPOSITE PAGE, WELL KNOWN WRITER GUY 
SORMAN WRITES AN OP-ED TITLED: "THE GAMES BETTER THAN THE UN." 
 
(C) SUPPORTING TEXT/BLOCK QUOTES: 
 
G-8: CLIMATE CHANGE - AFRICA 
 
"BLAIR IMPOSES HIS PRIORITIES" 
ALAIN BARLUET IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (07/06): "AS THE 
PRESIDENT OF A WEAKENED EUROPE, BLAIR EXPECTS A DIPLOMATIC 
CONSECRATION FROM THE G-8 SUMMIT. THE SUMMIT IS EXPECTED TO BE 
DOMINATED BY SERIOUS DIVERGING FRANCO-AMERICAN VIEWS AND TO A 
LESSER EXTENT DIVERGING FRANCO-BRITISH VIEWS. ON THE EVE OF 
THE SUMMIT, PRESIDENT BUSH'S REMARK THAT THE U.S. WAS 
`ABSOLUTELY' READY TO CANCEL AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES IF THE EU 
DID THE SAME WAS CLEARLY UPSETTING FOR CHIRAC. SIMILARLY, THE 
U.S. PRESIDENT REMAINED HOSTILE TO AN AGREEMENT ON THE CLIMATE 
IF `IT LOOKED LIKE THE KYOTO PROTOCOL.' THIS IS THE ISSUE OVER 
WHICH IT WILL BE THE HARDEST TO REACH A CONSENSUS." 
 
"CONSENSUS" 
ANTOINE DE GAUDEMAR IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (07/06): 
"SUDDENLY EVERYONE SEEMS READY TO JUMP FOR AFRICA. WHY SUCH 
EAGERNESS? BECAUSE THE OTHER ISSUES ON THE MENU ARE LESS 
PALATABLE, LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE, WHICH WILL REMAIN A BONE OF 
CONTENTION BECAUSE OF AMERICA'S INTRANSIGENCE? BECAUSE THE 
SUBJECT IS MORE CONSENSUAL? EVERYONE AGREES THAT AFRICA NEEDS 
HELP. A CONTINENT OVERWHELMED BY DESPAIR AND MISERY. IS A TIME 
BOMB. HENCE THE FIRST STEP AND THE CANCELLATION OF THE AFRICAN 
DEBT. ALTHOUGH SPECTACULAR IN APPEARANCE, THE CANCELLATION OF 
THE AFRICAN DEBT REMAINS AN INJUSTICE. THE POLITICAL 
DETERMINATION OF THE G-8 REGARDING AFRICA HAS EVERY CHANCE OF 
BEING LONG LASTING, BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON WELL-UNDERSTOOD 
INTERESTS. FOR THE AMERICANS, IT IS OIL, FOR THE FRENCH IT IS 
LEADERSHIP, AND FOR EVERYONE, THE FEAR OF SEEING NEW 
COMPETITORS LANDING, SUCH AS CHINA. PHILANTHROPY IS NOT 
NECESSARILY CYNICAL, BUT IT IS RARELY GRATUITOUS." 
 
"AFRICA BACK IN EVERYONE'S GOOD GRACES" 
CHRISTOPHE AYAD IN LEFT-OF-CENTER LIBERATION (07/06): "THE 
REASONS FOR THIS NEW INFATUATION WITH AFRICA ARE MANY. CHIRAC 
AND BLAIR NEVER MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THEMSELVES AS 
IMPASSIONED ADVOCATES FOR AFRICA. CHIRAC DEFENDS AFRICA'S 
INTERESTS AS MUCH AS HE DEFENDS FRANCE'S INTERESTS IN THE LAST 
OF ITS PRIVATE HUNTING GROUNDS: AFRICA IS THE LAST PLACE IN 
THE WORLD WHERE FRANCE'S VOICE COUNTS FOR SOMETHING, THUS 
ALLOWING IT TO PRESERVE ITS INFLUENCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL 
ARENA. IN AFRICA, BLAIR IS TRYING TO CHANGE HIS IMAGE OF 
WARMONGER, WHICH RESULTED FROM HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE WAR IN 
IRAQ, ALL THE WHILE HONORING HIS COMMITMENT TO `MORAL 
DIPLOMACY.' THE 9/11 ATTACKS HAVE AWAKENED AMERICA'S INTEREST 
FOR AFRICA. WHERE ARMS PROLIFERATION AND DRUGS ARE A SOURCE OF 
REAL CONCERN FOR THE WEST. BUT WASHINGTON ALSO WANTS TO 
DIVERSIFY ITS SOURCES OF ENERGY." 
 
"LONDON WANTS TO LOWER EXPECTATIONS ON FINAL AGREEMENT" 
LAURENCE TOVI IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LES ECHOS (07/06): "THE 
SUMMIT WILL PROBABLY SATISFY NEITHER THE PROPONENTS OF THE 
FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY NOR THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES. THE BRITISH 
AMBASSADOR TO FRANCE STATED: `THOSE WHO EXPECT THE ERADICATION 
OF POVERTY FROM THIS SUMMIT WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.' ON THE 
SECOND MAJOR TOPIC OF THE SUMMIT, CLIMATE CHANGE, PROGRESS 
WILL ALSO NOT BE IN KEEPING WITH THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS. WHILE 
NO ONE ANY LONGER EXPECTS THE U.S. TO RATIFY THE KYOTO 
PROTOCOL, CONSIDERED TO BE `A ROTTEN AGREEMENT FOR THE U.S. 
ECONOMY' BY THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, WASHINGTON HAS 
NEVERTHELESS SOFTENED ITS APPROACH. WHILE THE PREAMBLE ON 
RECOGNIZING HUMAN RESPONSIBILITY IN CLIMATE CHANGE NEEDS TO BE 
NEGOTIATED, THE PRINCIPLE OF A PLAN OF ACTION APPEARS TO HAVE 
BEEN ACCEPTED." 
 
"WILL BUSH GIVE IN ON CLIMATE CHANGE?" 
FREDERIC GERSHEL IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE PARISIEN (07/06): 
"PRESIDENT BUSH INTIMATED HE DID NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE 
KYOTO PROTOCOL. BUT CHIRAC WARNED THAT THERE WILL BE NO 
AGREEMENT ON THE CLIMATE IF THE U.S., THE WORLD'S NUMBER ONE 
POLLUTER, DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT IS A 
REALITY TIED TO HUMAN ACTIVITY. HE WANTS THE KYOTO PROTOCOL 
EXPLICITLY MENTIONED IN THE FINAL DOCUMENT. LAST NIGHT, WHITE 
HOUSE ADVISOR STEVE HADLEY SAID: `WE CAN ACCEPT LANGUAGE GOING 
IN THAT DIRECTION.' A FIRST STEP?" 
 
CENTRAL ASIA: SUMMIT IN KAZAKSTAN 
 
"BEIJING AND MOSCOW WANT U.S. TO WITHDRAW FROM CENTRAL ASIA" 
JEAN-JACQUES MEVEL IN RIGHT-OF-CENTER LE FIGARO (07/06): 
"CHINA AND RUSSIA YESTERDAY MOVED THEIR PAWNS IN A VERY 
INFLUENTIAL REGION OF THE WORLD. THEY CONVINCED FOUR CENTRAL 
ASIAN STATES TO PUT A STOP TO AMERICAN MILITARY AMBITIONS AND 
POLITICAL INTERVENTIONS IN THE REGION. THE CONCERN OF 
AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES IN THE FACE OF ADVANCING DEMOCRATIZATION 
EXPLAIN THEIR RALLYING TO BEIJING AND MOSCOW. TO THEM, CHINA'S 
DICTATORSHIP AND RUSSIA'S AUTHORITARIAN DEMOCRACY LOOK MORE 
REASSURING THAN THE POLITICAL OPENNESS CALLED FOR BY THE WEST. 
THE FINAL COMMUNIQU OF THE SUMMIT ILLUSTRATES THE STRATEGIC, 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISE OF CHINA IN A REGION WHERE THE 
U.S. IS TRYING TO ESTABLISH ITSELF LASTINGLY. THE SUMMIT COULD 
OPEN A NEW CHAPTER IN WHICH CHINA AND RUSSIA WILL FEEL 
SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO BACK EACH OTHER AND DEMAND THAT THE 
U.S. BEGIN ITS RETREAT FROM CENTRAL ASIA. THIS QUESTION WILL 
BE RAISED DURING SECRETARY RICE'S TRIP TO BEIJING AT THE END 
OF THIS WEEK. THE FACT THAT IRAN WAS AN OBSERVER AT THE SUMMIT 
IN ASTANA CAN ONLY RE-ENFORCE AMERICA'S CONCERNS." STAPLETON
