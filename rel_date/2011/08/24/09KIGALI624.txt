SUBJECT: FOOD SECURITY STABLE IN RWANDA 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: Rwandan production of staple food crops has 
increased 25 percent since 2006 as a result of agricultural 
reforms introduced in 2007, including better distribution of 
fertilizers and crop intensification programs.  Although food 
production is stable for 2009, dependency on adequate 
rainfall will continue to dictate food security concerns for 
the foreseeable future.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) Crops selected for crop intensification programs 
including rice, wheat, corn, Irish potatoes and cassava have 
shown dramatic gains over the last three years.  Wheat 
production has increased 233 percent, maize (corn) 168 
percent and cassava 268 percent.  Between 2008 and 2009 rice 
production increased 38 percent, for the first time resulting 
in lower prices compared to imported Tanzanian rice. 
Speaking to the press on September 24, the Minister of 
Agriculture also attributed increased agricultural yields to 
improved availability and distribution of fertilizers, and 
provision of new seed varieties to farmers. 
 
¶3. (U) Although gross domestic food production has increased, 
production of some crops declined from 2006-2009.  Production 
of beans, a key source of protein for rural populations, 
declined by 17 percent, sweet potatoes declined by 13 percent 
and sorghum by 11 percent.  Sweet potatoes and sorghum are 
staple crops for poor rural families who are chronically food 
insecure.  Typically these families subsist on farms of less 
than one hectare (2.2 acres).  Statistics from the Rwanda 
Agricultural Development Agency indicate that overall, food 
prices have increased by 80 percent from 2006 and 16 percent 
relative to 2008, primarily due to increased exports to 
neighboring countries. 
 
¶4. (U) COMMENT: Rwanda remains highly dependent on good 
rainfall for its food security.  As the country has had good 
rains over the last two years, agricultural production has 
improved and food security is currently stable.  Given 
Rwanda's ongoing dependence on rainfall, however, better 
irrigation systems, continued improvements in post-harvest 
storage facilities, availability of appropriate fertilizers 
and expanded extension services will continue to be needed 
for longer-term food security. END COMMENT.
