SUBJECT: NEW "OPPOSITION" PARTY ANNOUNCES KHABAROVSK LEADER 
 
¶1.  On November 25 the government-approved "opposition" party 
Pravoye Delo announced its appointment of Georgiy Podkolodniy to 
a four-year term as its Khabarovsk regional leader. 
Podkolodniy, who was the former head of the defunct Democratic 
Party in Khabarovskiy kray, edged out his main rival for the 
position Andrey Barzhanov, who is a former leader of the 
dissolved Union of Right Forces in Khabarovsk.  In Primorye, 
Pravoye Delo party members will elect a regional leader -- 
likely to be former regional leader of Union of Right Forces 
Nikolay Morozov -- by mid-December. 
 
¶2.  The new party incorporates members of three defunct and 
largely forgotten opposition parties which, even in relatively 
politically-active Primorye, had very low membership. 
Podkolodniy's Union of Right Forces had only few thousand 
members in the region.  Barzhanov's Democratic Party of Russia 
had just over 1,000 members.  The third party, Grazhdanskaya 
Sila had only 260 members in Primorye. 
 
¶3.  Most independent political observers in the RFE are 
skeptical about the new party and its potential effectiveness as 
an opposition.  Khabarovsk political observer Tatyana Zakharova 
told Kommersant that it will likely go largely unnoticed by the 
public.  Media sources stressed that the new party will consist 
mainly of current or former Yedinaya Rossiya members and 
regional chairs of Pravoye Delo will mostly be the ineffectual 
leaders of the old regional opposition parties. 
 
¶4.  Vladimir Popov, former Khabarovsk leader of the disbanded 
Svobodnie Demokraty Rossii party noted in the media that the new 
party will present merely a facade of democratic pluralism, and 
will not attract new members since Podkolodniy "does not 
communicate well and is not a good speaker."
