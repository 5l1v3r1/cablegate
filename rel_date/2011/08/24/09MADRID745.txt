SUBJECT: SPAIN H1N1 UPDATE: 1,526 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  While official figures are not available, 
media reports say that there are currently 1,526 H1N1 cases 
in Spain, the majority of which are mild.  To date, four 
people have died and 18 are in intensive care.  Off the 
record estimates by public health officials put the number of 
infected individuals at closer to 10,000.  Five members of 
the Embassy community reported H1N1 symptoms and were 
evaluated for exposure on July 23.  Most of the 
seventh-graders in a Johns Hopkins University summer program 
who were affected by an H1N1 outbreak have now departed 
Spain.  The Health Ministry announced plans to improve 
coordination and preparation in advance of an expected 
increase of infections. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On June 12, Health Minister Trinidad Jimenez announced 
that her ministry would discontinue reporting new cases in 
order to avoid the "numbers dance."  Doctors are now only 
testing cases that require hospitalization and are diagnosing 
cases based on exposure and epidemiological criteria.  Media 
reports say there are 1,526 H1N1 cases in Spain, most of 
which are mild.  To date, four people have died and 18 are 
presently in intensive care.  Off the record estimates by 
doctors and public health authorities put the number of 
infected individuals at closer to 10,000.  They say that 
there are severe cases in all 17 communities of Spain.  They 
are also seeing numerous suspected cases of children from 
summer camps throughout Spain, some of which have been 
confirmed by testing. Additionally, media reports indicate 
that two Spanish student groups suspected of having H1N1 are 
being held in isolation in Paris and Beijing. 
 
Infections involving AMCITS 
 
¶3. (SBU) Five members of the Embassy community have reported 
H1N1 symptoms, following a visit by a Marine Security 
Guard--on leave here while en route to Romania--who later 
tested positive for H1N1.  He presented symptoms on arrival 
in Romania, tested positive, and is now receiving treatment. 
The Embassy community members went for testing at a local 
hospital on July 23.  However, under the protocol Spanish 
medical authorities are now applying, since they did not 
require hospitalization, the doctors performed evaluations 
only.  They consider the group positive for H1N1 exposure, 
applying epidemiological criteria.  The Embassy Health Unit 
is currently caring for the five individuals and they are 
progressing well.  The Health Unit is also closely monitoring 
personnel who have had contact with the five individuals and 
the Embassy held a town hall meeting to reiterate procedures 
to be used to restrict the spread of flu. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A twelve-year-old AMCIT boy residing in Cadiz tested 
positive for H1N1 and is currently receiving treatment.  He 
is expected to recover fully. 
 
¶5. (SBU) An outbreak of H1N1 at a summer program for gifted 
seventh-graders run by Johns Hopkins University was the 
subject of a duty case with congressional interest from 
Representative Mark Schauer (D-MI).  Of a group of 56 
students studying in Madrid, an estimated 14 tested positive 
for H1N1 and were put in isolation.   Program administrator 
Jenny Sutton told Econoff that they followed health protocols 
in accordance with Spain's Ministry of Health and advice from 
International SOS.  As of July 23, the program has released 
all students to their parents or authorized representatives 
and most have departed Spain about a week earlier than 
scheduled. 
 
Spanish Government Preparing for Increase in Infections 
 
¶6. (U) Minister of Health Trinidad Jimenez announced plans to 
improve coordination and preparation in advance of an 
expected increase in H1N1 infections this fall.  The National 
Health Services expect to be able to treat up to 15.4 million 
people--about 30% of Spain's population--for the H1N1 virus. 
Jimenez announced that Spain currently has enough medicine to 
treat 9.5 million people, and that it is divided according to 
population and need among the 17 autonomous communities.  The 
Health Ministry has ordered more, and expects a shipment in 
late August of two million anti-viral doses.  There are no

plans to close schools, but the Ministry intends to launch a 
public awareness campaign.
