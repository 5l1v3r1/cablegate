SUBJECT: VENEZUELA REPORTS THREE CONFIRMED H1N1 CASES 
 
¶1.  On May 28, via a press release on its website 
(www.mpps.gob.ve), the Venezuelan Ministry of Health (MoH) 
confirmed the first case of H1N1 in Venezuela.  According to 
the press release, the individual, a male of 22 years, 
returned May 25 from a five day trip to Panama and 
subsequently checked into a private clinic, which, upon 
evaluation of his symptoms, initiated the chain of diagnosis, 
notification, and testing that led to the MoH's confirmation 
of H1N1.  On May 29, a subsequent MoH press release confirmed 
a second H1N1 case, a 24 year old female who had traveled on 
the same flight as the first patient (Copa Airlines Flight 
221 from Panama.)  The second patient, according to the MoH 
press release, had "high risk contact" with the first 
confirmed case.  Press reports indicate that she is the 
girlfriend of the first confirmed patient.  In addition, the 
media has reported a human to human transmission, that of a 
relative of the first patient confirmed with H1N1.  All three 
confirmed cases are reported to be stable and under strict 
medical surveillance and confinement. 
 
¶2.  Post's EAC met to review the situation on May 29 and has 
determined that we remain at tripwire one.
