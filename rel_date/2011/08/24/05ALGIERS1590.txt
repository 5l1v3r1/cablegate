 ¶1.  The Algerian media reported July 31 the text of 
President Bouteflika's July 30 message to Moroccan King 
Mohammed VI on the occasion of the Throne Day holiday. 
Bouteflika expressed "his warmest congratulations and dearest 
wishes" to the king, praying that God protect him and grant 
him health and happiness.  Bouteflika similarly wished 
Morocco prosperity and well-being under the king's 
leadership.  The message went on to reiterate Bouteflika's 
determination to "strengthen solidarity and promote 
cooperation" between Algeria and Morocco and to build 
relations "based on the historic ties that unite the two 
peoples and mutual respect." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  We note that Bouteflika's warm message 
echoed similar sentiments expressed by King Mohammed in his 
congratulatory message on the occasion of Algerian national 
day July 5, but it contrasted sharply with harsh comments 
reportedly expressed by the king in his Throne Day speech to 
his own people.  At least two GOA ministers and a number of 
senior MFA officials and parliamentarians attended the 
Moroccan national day reception hosted by Ambassador Benryane 
in Algiers July 30.  Benryane's garden wall featured a large 
photo of Bouteflika and King Mohammed embracing during the 
Algiers Arab summit last March.  Algerian guests at the 
reception commented to us that Algerians and Moroccans get 
along extremely well, even if their governments do not.
