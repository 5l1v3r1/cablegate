(SBU) Lithuanian Chief of Defense Major General Valdas Tutkus 
detailed for the Ambassador November 10 a proposal for the 
GOL to attach its Iron Wolf Brigade to the headquarters of a 
division of the Danish armed forces.  This relationship will 
likely entail exchanges of staff officers and future joint 
exercises.  Tutkus explained that the MOD is keen on this 
concept because it will provide Lithuanian officers unique 
experience at the division and corps level, and expanded 
opportunities for training.  He said that Lithuania's 
decision to consolidate its contingent in Iraq into the 
Danish sector underscores its commitment to deepen ties with 
the Danes.  Tutkus added that this link with Denmark will be 
a key element of Lithuania's future participation in the 
coalition in Iraq.
