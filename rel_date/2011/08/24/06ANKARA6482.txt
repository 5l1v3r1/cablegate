SUBJECT: EXBS: UPDATE ON INTERNAL CONTROL PROGRAM AND 
INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT FORUM PROPOSAL 
 
REF: A. USDOC 6121 
 
     ¶B. USDOC 6281 
 
¶1.  Summary: The Government of Turkey continues to work on 
the customization of the Internal Control Program for use by 
Turkish businesses.  Completion of the initial customization 
awaits confirmation of the translation of the EU control list 
by appropriate Turkish institutions; lack of ratification of 
the Nonproliferation Cooperation Agreement by the Turkish 
Grand National Assembly could be having an effect on the 
confirmation of the translation.  The GOT recommends delaying 
the proposed instructor training (ref a) and 
Industry-Government (I-G) Forum (ref b) until final 
confirmation of translated EU control list and Beta testing 
of program. End Summary. 
 
¶2. EXBS Advisor met with Ziya Demirduzen, Head of Department 
of Export Controls for the Undersecretary of Foreign Trade 
(UFT) concerning the status of the ICP and the planning of 
the I-G forum. Demirduzen stated that work by the contractor 
to customize the basic software package is nearly complete. 
However the Ministry of Defense and Turkish Atomic Energy 
Authority review of the translated EU control list is taking 
longer than expected.  (Note: The translation of the EU 
control list from English to Turkish was not part of the 
original ICP project.  This was added to the project in Sept 
2006 because the GOT did not have a comprehensive translation 
of the EU control list to be included in the ICP program. End 
note.)  Demirduzen expects to have input from these agencies 
within several weeks.  According to Demirduzen, because of 
this delay, the ICP project will not be completed in time to 
conduct the instructor training and Industry-Government Forum 
as originally planned.  Demirduzen suggested postponing these 
events until the end of January or early February to allow 
sufficient time for the translated control list to be 
verified and the ICP to be properly Beta-tested by the 
contractor. 
 
¶3.  Serhan Yigit, MFA Disarmament and Arms Control First 
Secretary, stated that some of the institutions had concerns 
 
SIPDIS 
about working on projects which could be perceived to fall 
under the Nonproliferation Cooperation Agreement with the 
United States, which has not yet been ratified by Parliament. 
 Yigit added that while the MFA has informed the relevant 
institutions that it does not consider work on the ICP 
project as working around the Agreement, it also does not 
have the authority to force participation prior to 
ratifiction of the Agreement.  Yigit continued that Depty 
FM Tuygan and Deputy U/S for InternationalSecurity Affairs 
Rafet Akgunay recognize the mportance of ratifying the 
Agreement. (Note: DCM during a Nov 17 meeting with Akgunay 
raised the need to ratify the NP Agreement.  Akgunay informed 
us that he recently had a long meeting with Parliamentarians 
concerning the Agreement and believes that it will be 
approved in the coming weeks.  End note.) 
 
¶4.  We will continue to work with UFT and other GOT 
institutions to complete the customization of ICP and the 
selection of appropriate dates for both the instructor 
training and I-G Forum.  UFT contacts have underscored the 
importance of the I-G forum to assist them to achieve the 
goal of increasing the cooperation between UFT and the 
business community.  We concur with the GOT recommendation to 
delay the I-G forum and instructor training until the EU 
control list can be verified and incorporated into the ICP.
