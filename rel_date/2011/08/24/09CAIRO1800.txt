SUBJECT: EGYPT:  COUNTRY TEAM ASSESSMENT FOR THE PRICING AND 
AVAILABILITY REQUEST FOR 161 NVG SETS FOR THE EGYPTIAN AIR FORCE 
F-16 FLEET INCLUDING MODIFICATION OF 137 F-16 AIRCRAFT TO 
NVG-COMPATIBILITY IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF EGYPT NATIONAL 
DEFENSE MISSION 
 
REF: A. EGYPTIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE LETTER OF REQUEST (08-184) 
     FOR PRICE AND AVAILABILITY DATED 12 DEC 08. 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU).  Please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Description.  REF A is the GOE request for pricing and 
availability of 161 Night Vision Goggles (NVG) sets and the 
modification of 137 F-16 aircraft to an NVG compatible configuration 
to support their national defense mission. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Reason the purchaser desires the articles or services.  The 
procurement of these NVGs will help the EAF achieve a full range of 
vision during night flights.  This will improve the Egyptian Air 
Force's (EAF) flight safety at night and will enhance their ability 
to identify targets at night. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) How the articles or services would affect the recipient's 
force structure.  These NVGs and the modifications of the aircraft 
will increase the EAF capability to operate more safely and 
effectively at night. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) How the articles or services would contribute to both the 
U.S. and the recipient's defense/security goals.  NVG sales are 
consistent with DOD's Security Cooperation Guidance as it enhances 
the territorial security of regional states.  It also supports two 
of CENTCOM's Security Cooperation objectives for Egypt: (1) enabling 
allies and partners, and (2) protecting U.S. and partner interests. 
This NVG capability will also support two of CENTCOM's Security 
Cooperation Desired Effects (SCDE) for Egypt: 
-- SCDE 3.2 "Support the defense modernization and transformation of 
allies or partners to reduce their vulnerability to external 
aggression and coercion" 
-- SCDE 4.2 "Improve their capability to operate independently or as 
part of a coalition with U.S. Forces" 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Justification for the type and quantity of articles or 
services requested.  A site survey conducted by the USG will be 
required to determine the appropriate type of NVGs to support the 
EAF mission.  24 of the requested 161 sets will provision the 24 new 
F-16 aircraft that the EAF currently has requested.   The remaining 
137 sets will provision 29 Block 15 F-16s, 29 Block 32 F-16s and 79 
Block 40 F-16s. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Combatant Commander's concurrence to the introduction of a 
new warfighting capability to the nation or region.  Combatant 
Commander's concurrence will be provided separately. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Anticipated reactions of the neighboring nations. 
The procurement of these NVGs may influence the regional balance of 
power and cause negative reactions from Egypt's neighbors.  While it 
does not introduce new technology to Egypt or the region, it does 
introduce new/enhanced capability. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Assessment of the nation's ability to account for, 
safeguard, operate, maintain, and support the articles. The 
Egyptians have demonstrated the intent and ability to protect 
sensitive, classified military technology over an extended period. 
Egypt signed a General Security of Information Agreement with the 
U.S. and, as a customer, has purchased and protected the sensitive 
technology of other U.S. weapons systems.  Egypt has procured night 
vision technology in the past to include the AN/ANVS-6(V)1 and has 
met all previous security and End Use monitoring (EUM) 
requirements. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Training required either in-country or in the United 
States and anticipated reactions resulting from the presence of U.S. 
trainers in country.  A Mobile Training Team will likely be required 
to train the Egyptians on the use and care of these NVGs.  There is 
no other additional presence that will be required beyond normal 
U.S. interaction and training (ETSS) with the individual EAF 
aircrews. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Possible impact of any in-country U.S. presence that might 
be required as a result of providing the article.  U.S. Government 
civilian personnel and U.S. contractors are permanently assigned to 
Egypt to support the current EAF F-16 program.  Those US positions 
have been filled for years.  There is an anticipated short-term 
presence of the Mobile Training Team of US personnel in-country that 
would be necessary to provide training for the There is no expected 
negative impact that would result from these additional Americans 
being in Egypt. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Source of financing and the economic impact of the 
proposed acquisition.  Egypt plans to pay for the aircraft 
 
 
 
 
modifications and procure the NVGs utilizing Foreign Military 
Financing.  The Egyptian Government will only request A Letter of 
Offer and Acceptance if the cost meets their established budget. 
Egypt is not planning to use national funds to pay for any portion 
of this procurement. 
 
¶12. (SBU) Human rights considerations relevant to the proposed 
acquisition.  None. 
 
¶13. (SBU) A plan for end-use monitoring for sensitive and advanced 
warfighting technology and the SAO's plan for compliance 
verification.  The Office of Military Cooperation (OMC) Egypt has a 
robust Golden Sentry Program.  The Golden Sentry point of contact, 
working in close coordination with the security assistance program 
officer, will review and maintain copies of the customer's physical 
security and accountability control plan.  All parties will maintain 
a serial number list of all NVGs within the inventory or 
transferred, and will conduct the mandated and inspections as 
required.  The Egyptian military currently has over 2500 Night 
Vision Devices of various configurations in-country and has 
maintained accountability and security of those devices without 
unauthorized loss, theft, or access to date. 
 
¶14. (SBU)  Recommendation whether the USG should approve transfer of 
the article and justification.  The country team recommends USG 
approval for Pricing and Availability of the NVGs and aircraft 
modifications. This is a coordinated mission position.
