SUBJECT: CIVIL SPACE COOPERATION: MFA PRESSES FOR 
FINALIZATION OF TECHNOLOGY SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 87116 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  On October 12, EUR/PRA Director Antia 
Friedt discussed the Framework Technology Safeguards 
Agreement (TSA) and other civil space cooperation issues with 
Andrei Kruitskikh of MFA's Department of Disarmament and 
Security Affairs (DVBR).  Kruitskikh noted the good progress 
made during the June round of Framework TSA talks (reftel) 
and urged that the next negotiating round take place no later 
than early December.  Friedt tentatively agreed to 
Kruitskikh's offer to host the next interagency negotiating 
round in November/early December. End Summary. 
 
Framework Technology Safeguards Agreement 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  EUR/PRA Director Friedt, accompanied by Embassy 
EST, met in Moscow October 12 with DVBR's Kruitskikh and 
Sergei Shestakov. Friedt informed Kruitskikh that the latest 
TSA negotiating draft was still being reviewed by the 
 
SIPDIS 
interagency; she hoped to be able to provide a new draft in 
the next week.   Friedt asked Kruitskikh to clarify what 
Russia wants in terms of access to U.S. space projects and 
how this access would be managed.   Kruitskikh replied that 
everything would be done in accordance with Article V: 
Technology Security Plans (TSPs).  The TSPs would be drafted, 
approved, and supervised by relevant agencies (NASA and 
Roskosmos).  The plans themselves would be 99% technical, 
specific to the joint space project implemented, and in 
accordance with national laws and regulations.  The 
governments would have a "supervisory" or "oversight" role. 
Kruitskikh said that the Russian side was at first skeptical 
about Article V, but now realizes it is a "perfect solution." 
Kruitskikh made a number of other comments regarding ongoing 
TSA negotiations with other countries, including Australia, 
 
SIPDIS 
Brazil, and South Korea.  He repeated comments he made during 
negotiations in Washington in June regarding difficulties 
encountered during negotiations with the Australians, 
including protection of classified information sharing 
between the U.S. and Australia. 
 
Other Pending Space-Related Agreements 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Friedt asked about the status of two other space 
cooperation agreements:  the "Agreement for Cooperation in 
the Exploration and Use of Space for Peaceful Purposes" 
(Civil Space Agreement) and the "Agreement Concerning the 
Procedure for the Customs Documentation and Duty-Free Entry 
of Good Transported within the Framework of U.S. Russian 
Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Space for Peaceful 
Purposes" (Customs Agreement).   Both agreements have been 
under review by the Russian side since summer.  Kruitskikh 
replied that the GOR hoped to respond in the next two weeks 
via dipnote to extend the agreements. Kruitskikh then 
inquired about the status of the Baikonur Technology 
Safeguards Agreement.  We explained that the English-language 
version of the Kazakhstani text still contained several legal 
discrepancies which the Government of Kazakhstan (GOK) needed 
to address before the Baikonur TSA could move forward.  When 
asked about the status of the Russian-Kazakstani text, 
Kruitskikh said that the GOK was stalling in order to gain 
leverage on renegotiating rental terms for the GOR's use of 
the Baikonur launch site.  Kruitskikh urged us to pressure 
the GOK and "discipline the process" in order to get the 
Baikonur agreement ratified.  Friedt replied that we would 
ask our Embassy in Astana to inquire regarding the status. 
 
"Passionately Waiting" 
--------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Kruitskikh concluded the meeting by alleging that 
President Putin was annoyed that the Framework TSA has been 
stalled and that DVBR would like its year-end report to the 
President to say that the TSA was ready for signature. 
Kruitskikh said he is "passionately waiting" to hear back 
from the USG and for experts on both sides to agree to dates 
for the next round of negotiations in Moscow, adding that he 
hoped to see full U.S. interagency participation, including 
NASA.   Friedt said she hopes to have interagency feedback on 
the text soon and promised to consult with interagency 
colleagues and get back to Kruitskikh regarding specific 
dates.   Kruitskikh said his schedule was free in November, 
with the exception of the very last week in November. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)   Kruitskikh is personally committed to a TSA 
agreement, but it appears to be less of a priority for others 
in the GOR.  Deputy Foreign Minister Kislyak has not recently 
raised it.  Nonetheless, TSA remains a Presidential Checklist 
item and we should continue to demonstrate to the Russian 
side that we are committed to successfully negotiating this 
agreement.
