President Obama's decisions and activities continue to be given top 
billing in the Lebanese press.  Several media outlets tried to 
interpret President Obama's intentions for the Middle East, 
Afghanistan, and Iraq by trying to understand the background of his 
diplomatic appointees to the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
Editorialists seemed to believe that President Obama will give 
priority to the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, 
and will move war from Iraq to Afghanistan.  Some newspapers sounded 
disappointed with his position on Hamas, but also noted with 
satisfaction that he already signed an Executive Order to close 
Guantanamo, "the prison of shame," and observed that he tried to 
create a balance between Israel's right to security and the 
Palestinians' right to hope for a bright future.

"Phone Diplomacy," an editorial by Sateh Noureddine in Arab 
nationalist As-Safir (1/23): 
 
"...The new American President Barak Obama did his first four 
telephone calls from the White House to four Middle Eastern leaders: 
Israeli Prime Minister Olmert, Egyptian President Mubarak; Jordanian 
King Abdallah, and the Palestinian President Abbas.  The White House 
did not announce a lot of details about these calls.  ...Many 
speculated about these phone calls:  Were they the first thing Obama 
did on the first day of his presidency? Was he trying to fulfill his 
promises during the Israeli aggression on Gaza when he said that he 
will give the Gaza issue the attention it deserves when he assumes 
his responsibilities as president? ...In any case, his choosing 
these four leaders specifically...was certainly intentional.  ...It 
is an indication that the United States will give priority to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  ...Furthermore, President Obama's 
call to President Abbas gave him additional international legitimacy 
particularly since he will be given the funds to rebuild Gaza 
instead of Hamas..."
