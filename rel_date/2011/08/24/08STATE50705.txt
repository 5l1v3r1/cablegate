SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN PRE-LICENSE END USE CHECK ON 
APPLICATION 05-050101397 
 
 
¶1.  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-6. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
pre-license check for the export of radiation tolerant DC/DC 
converters to Russia.  Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request: the Russian entities listed on this 
license application have no licensing history with our 
office.  The requested commodity is designed for use in low 
earth orbit satellites and launch vehicles.  The license 
application states that the commodity will be used in a fire 
alarm and security system (FASS) at a nuclear power plant. 
 
¶4.  ACTION: Please contact the Foreign End User, Russian 
Ministry of Atomic Energy, to determine if they can confirm 
this specific order for components, and the use of these 
components by the Foreign Consignee TENZOR for a FASS 
intended for the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant. 
 
¶5.  Contact the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant.  Inquire 
with Novovoronezh to ascertain if they can confirm this 
specific order for components, and the use of these 
components by the Foreign Consignee TENZOR for a FASS 
intended for the plant. 
 
¶6.  Finally, please contact Foreign Consignee JSC Instrument 
Plant TENZOR.  Ask TENZOR to explain why they need radiation 
tolerant satellite components for the FASS of Novovoronezh. 
(A nuclear plant expert contacted by PM/DTCC did not 
understand why radiation tolerant components would be used in 
a FASS because such systems are not located in radioactive 
areas.)  Also ask TENZOR if all of the requested components 
will be used in the Novovoronezh plant FASS, or were any 
extra components ordered for stockpiling and use on another 
program?  END ACTION.
