DONATIONS FOR JUNE 23 VIENNA CONFERENCE ON RECONSTRUCTION 
OF LEBANON'S NAHR AL-BARID REFUGEE CAMP 
 
REF: STATE 60216 
 
(SBU) On June 18, Deputy Economic Counselor delivered reftel 
points to Eva Areskoug, Deputy Director, Department for 
Security Policy, at the Swedish MFA.  Areskoug commented that 
Sweden is a strong supporter of the United Nations Relief and 
Works Agency and remains engaged in efforts that resulted 
from a substantial Swedish financial commitment made in 
connection with the Lebanon Conference in 2006 in Stockholm. 
She noted that Sweden will not be able to send any 
senior-level participants from Stockholm due to extremely 
busy schedules and has therefore instructed the Swedish 
embassy in Vienna to represent Sweden at the conference. 
Areskoug added that Sweden has not made any decisions 
regarding pledges for reconstruction or which individuals 
from the embassy will attend the conference.
