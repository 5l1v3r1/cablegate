In Today's Papers 
 
General Buyukanit Visits the US 
All papers report Turkish General Staff (TGS) chief General Yasar 
Buyukanit met with Vice President Cheney and National Security 
Advisor Stephen Hadley in Washington yesterday.  At a reception 
given in his honor, Buyukanit warned "those dreaming of dividing 
Turkey" that there were "dynamic forces protecting the country," and 
that "no one could divide the country."  Buyukanit maintained that 
no one could carry Turkey to a point other than one determined by 
the constitution.  With regard to a possible adoption of an Armenian 
genocide resolution by the US Congress, Buyukanit said "I have 
worked with the US military for 50 years, and I can say that if such 
a thing happens, we will be hurt.  Esteemed commanders of the 
American armed forces will share our feelings."  Buyukanit stressed 
if the resolution passes, "We will be hurt, but I believe reasonable 
American citizens will refrain from hurting Turkey."  The General 
also said the terror of the outlawed PKK in Turkey and northern Iraq 
and Iraq's integrity were not separate issues, warning the Iraqi 
Kurds on the matter.  On his first US visit as the head of the 
Turkish military, Buyukanit will meet with General Peter Pace and 
Under Secretary for Defense Eric Edelman on Thursday. 
 
Erdogan Says Article 301 to be Changed 
All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan told the press before 
departing for Turkmenistan on Wednesday that Article 301 of the 
Turkish Penal Code, which makes it a crime to "insult Turkishness" 
will be amended next week.  "Some NGOs have submitted a proposal for 
changing Article 301 rather than scrapping it.  We are now working 
to block the prosecutors from filing lawsuits even on applications 
coming from third persons," Erdogan said. state as wellas the TGS."  TAYAD members 
will appear beforQ court on April 19. 
 
On the other hand, Cumhuriyet reports 34 international NGOs as well 
as organizations such as International Journalists Association, 
International Journalists Federation, and International Publishers 
Organization have sent a letter to the Turkish government, calling 
for the abolishment of Article 301 rather than the amendment of it. 
 
 
Show TV Series 'Kurtlar Vadisi' (Valley of the Wolves) Might be 
Stopped 
All papers report that, following the receipt of 14,000 complains 
from the public, the chairman of RTUK (Radio TV High Commission), 
Zahid Akman met with the Show TV director Saner Ayar to discuss a 
possible ban on broadcasting  the TV series 'Kurtlar Vadisi-Teror'. 
Public concern was mainly that the series sets a bad example for 
youth as it contains too much violence.  Show TV administration 
stressed that they are looking for ways to stop broadcasting the 
mentioned program without facing any legal charges from the 
producers of the series. 
 
Renewed Investigation against Roj TV 
Sabah, Vatan and others:  A Danish Prosecutor Karsten Hjort decided 
to renew the investigation into Roj TV.  Turkey had several 
initiatives in the past for the closure of the TV channel, claiming 
it was the mouthpiece of the PKK.  The Danish opposition claimed

and Turkey.

Hak-Par Officials Given Prison Terms for Speaking Kurdish 
Zaman, Cumhuriyet, Radikal and others:  A court yesterday sentenced 
13 top members of the pro-Kurdish party for Rights and Freedoms 
(Hak-Par), up to one year in prison for speaking Kurdish in the 
party's first general congress three years ago and sending 
Kurdish-language invitations to participants and several state 
officials.  The court also decided to file a complaint with the 
Court of Appeals Chief Public Prosecutor's Office to outlaw the 
party under the Political Parties Law. 
 
Editorial Commentary on North Korea, Iran 
Fikret Ertan observes in the Islamist-intellectual Zaman:  "The 
nuclear programs of both Iran and North Korea are among the most 
important issues that the international community currently faces. 
Whether a settlement can be found to the Iranian issue still remains 
to be seen.  But at least the North Korean nuclear program issue has 
been resolved diplomatically via an interim agreement.  The 
agreement signed in Beijing, demonstrates a change in the Bush 
administration's 'no talks policy' for North Korea.  Managing to 
change the nature of the North Korean crisis and bring it under 
diplomatic management provides hope and an example for the 
settlement of the Iranian issue as well.  In this respect, Secretary 
Rice has already stated that effective international cooperation 
which achieved the agreement was a message to Iran." 
 
Sami Kohen comments in the mainstream Milliyet:  "The agreement with 
North Korea meets the primary expectations of the US as well as the 
other signatories.  With the help of this development, North Korea 
will be able to overcome the isolation and be treated as part of the 
international community.  Even though North Korea will be able to 
get away with its already produced 10 atomic bombs, the overall 
apprers like 
defyingthe world when it comes to defending their nuclQar power 
ideal.  But there are some differences between Iran and North Korea. 
 First of all, it is richer than North Korea and has the capacity to 
endure outside sanctions.  The fact of the matter is that unlike in 
the case of North Korean, there is no unified bloc against Iran 
either.  Nevertheless, the North Korean example is about diplomacy 
prevailing over force, and it certainly is worth trying over and 
over again."
