Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds leads with news on UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon urging 
Israel to meet its road map obligations, including the complete 
cessation of settlement expansion, in order to achieve peace in the 
region. Ban stressed that continued settlement activities would be a 
violation of international law. Additionally, he called on Israel to 
stop taking unilateral measures in East Jerusalem, and described the 
separation wall as "illegal." The report notes that Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on July 22 a number of 
conditions for Israel to recognize a Palestinian state, including 
recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, demilitarization of a 
Palestinian state, and no right of return for Palestinian refugees 
to Israel. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with news on Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President Mahmoud Abbas's meeting with the Russian Deputy Minister 
of Foreign Affairs in Ramallah on July 22. Abbas noted in a joint 
press conference that the PA is committed to the road map and noted 
that the main obstacle to peace is continued settlement expansion, 
including natural growth. 
 
Al-Quds runs front page coverage citing Israeli daily Maariv that 
PLO Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat conveyed to the US the PA's request 
to force Israel to remove the separation wall between Israel and the 
West Bank. Erekat argued that it is no longer needed in light of 
enhanced PA security measures. In related news, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
runs front page coverage citing wires on Israeli Prime Minister 
Netanyahu's statement on July 22 that "the wall will remain there 
and will never be removed." 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page coverage citing AFP on PLO chief 
negotiator Saeb Erekat noting that US Special Envoy George Mitchell 
will meet with President Abbas in Ramallah on July 27.  The paper 
notes that Mitchell will also meet with PA Prime Minister Salam 
Fayyad.  Erekat added that he hopes the visit will lead to further 
pressure on Israel to halt settlement expansion and implement its 
road map obligations. 
 
All dailies report on Prime Minister Fayyad's remarks on July 22 in 
Ramallah that the PA's financial system has become significantly 
more transparent, with a much higher level of accountability, and 
can be trusted by all parties. ------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Talal Okal opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title, 
"It is the time for initiatives" (07/23): "Every country has 
condemned Israel for continuing with settlement activities and eve*u(%p 
1\ Israel to halt the settlements. Yet, Israel 
has not responded to any of these calls. Should we therefore 
understand from this that there are unspoken agreements between 
Israel and the US to continue with settlement activities?" 
 
2) Abdallah Awwad opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title "Fatah conference" (07/23): "There is no confidence in any 
dialogue with the Occupation... All previous negotiations with the 
Israelis proved to be a waste of time ... Did the Israelis stop 
settlement activities? Did they stop arresting the Palestinians? 
? 
...The essence of the occupation will never change, so what is the 
 
JERUSALEM 00001268  002 OF 002 
 
 
use of restarting negotiations?"
