Dear Mr. President: 
 
I heard with great dismay the tragic news about the damage 
caused by the tornadoes that have been hitting your country, 
in Alabama and Missouri, since last Thursday and which led to 
the death of 19 of your fellow citizens. 
 
On this painful occasion, I would like to express on behalf 
of the Ivorian people and Government, as well as in my own 
name, my deep sympathy to you and request your Excellency to 
extend to the bereaved and distressed families, as well as to 
the entire American nation, my sincere compassion and 
heartfelt condolences. 
 
Sincerely, 
Laurent Gbagbo 
President of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire 
 
End Translation.
