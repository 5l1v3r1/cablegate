SUBJECT: SUDAN'S PUBLIC ORDER COURTS - ENFORCING MORALITY WITH A 
LASHING 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  First instituted by former President Nimeiri in 
1983 as part of an Islamicizing trend, Sudan's Public Order Courts 
have continued to serve as the state mechanism for morality 
enforcement since the National Islamic Front's rise to power in 
¶1989.  Today the court still issues punishments ranging from fines, 
to lashings, to lengthy prison sentences for offences such as 
drinking alcohol, wearing inappropriate clothing, or associating 
with unmarried women. On July 31, poloff and conoff met with an 
Amcit and Canadian citizen both of whom had been found guilty under 
this code. The female Amcit was found guilty of wearing 
inappropriate clothing and paid a relatively small fine.  The 
Canadian, convicted of drinking alcohol while being with an 
unmarried woman, faces a stiffer sentence.   END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On July 31, conoff received a call from a journalist who 
reported that a Sudanese-American citizen found guilty of public 
indecency would reportedly soon be lashed at a Public Order Court in 
North Khartoum for indecent dress.  Poloff and conoff traveled to 
the court and met Anok E. Kuanyin Agoth, a twenty year old 
Sudanese-American dual national.  Agoth reported that on July 24 she 
walked to a nearby shop in jeans and a short-sleeve shirt. When an 
officer approached Agoth, she said he informed her that her clothing 
was indecent and that he "could see my body shape." The officer 
arrested Agoth, who was held for 2.5 hours at the police station. 
She said she did not inform the authorities of her American 
citizenship because she feared repercussions.   The judge heard 
Agoth's case a week later, found her guilty, and issued a sentence 
that allowed her to choose between ten lashes and one  month in jail 
or payment of a fine of 100 Sudanese Pounds (appx. $50.)   Agoth 
paid the fine and left the court. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Court officials informed conoff and poloff that they had 
also tried and found guilty another person they said was a 
Sudanese-American citizen of drinking alcohol and associating with 
an unmarried woman.  Court officials stated that this individual was 
sentenced to one month in jail, 80 lashes, and a 2000 pound fine. 
The court granted access to the prisoner.  However, he told emboffs 
he held Canadian-Sudanese dual citizenship and was not an Amcit. 
Conoff notified the Canadian consul of the detained Canadian 
citizen. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Coincidentally, when the Agoth case happened, CDA Fernandez 
was meeting with DUP parliamentarian Mudawi al-Turabi who is very 
familiar with the Public Order Courts. He described them as 
"arbitrary, corrupt local institutions" and often staffed by 
illiterate and ignorant petty officials looking to supplement their 
pay by extortion and harassment. Turabi, who has immunity as a 
parliamentarian, was recently accosted by two young men claiming to 
be working for the Public Order Courts. It turned out that they were 
indeed working for a local court and were cashiered former SAF 
paratroopers looking for a little extra cash. Turabi's charge was to 
be that he had been talking to or associated with a young woman who 
is not a relative. He succeeded in calling a police general friend 
who arrested them for illegally bothering his friend - in Sudan, 
both justice and injustice can be personal and venal. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Despite significant liberalization in the last 10 
years, Sudan still has some strict laws on the books regarding dress 
codes for women, consumption of alcohol and "immoral" behavior, 
giving license to freelance Islamists and corrupt officials to 
extort a few pounds from the powerless. ConOff is sending suggested 
edits to CA for to post for travelers planning to come to Sudan. 
END COMMENT.
