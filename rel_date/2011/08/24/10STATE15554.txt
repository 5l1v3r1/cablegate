SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The United States designated four entities and 
one individual related to the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard Corps (IRGC) on February 10, 2010, under Executive 
Order (E.O.) 13382 (Blocking Property of Weapons of 
Mass Destruction Proliferators and Their Supporters). 
While consistent with the pressure track of the 
Administrations (and other P5+1 members) two-track 
Iran policy, these designations are also consistent with 
existing and long-standing U.S. legal authorities and 
requirements targeting the networks of entities that 
support Irans proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction.  They do not signify an intention to 
circumvent or prejudice efforts getting underway to pass 
a new UN Security Council resolution on Iran and 
implement new coordinated national measures that would 
build on a new resolution.  They intend to demonstrate 
our commitment to the full implementation of our E.O. 
13382 authorities and reiterate our concerns with the 
IRGCs role in Irans policies of proliferation and 
regional destabilization.  We want to notify countries 
of these designations and urge all governments to take 
similar steps to prevent the IRGC from abusing the 
international financial and commercial system to further 
activities that could support Irans nuclear and missile 
programs.

OBJECTIVES/ACTION REQUEST 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Posts are requested to pursue the following 
objectives and pass the non-paper in paragraph four to 
appropriate host government officials.  The text of the 
non-paper was published by the State Department as a 
media note on February 10, 2010, and can be found at 
www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/02/136595.htm.  It was 
also published by the Treasury Department as a press 
release on February 10, 2010, and can be found at 
http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/tg539.htm . 
 
-- Inform host government officials of the U.S. 
designations under E.O. 13382. 
 
-- Notify host government officials that these 
designations are part of our ongoing implementation of 
existing sanctions under E.O. 13382 and demonstrate that 
we will continue to implement laws and impose sanctions 
to impede Iranian proliferation activities.  These 
designations are not meant to prejudice or circumvent 
efforts to apply additional pressure on Iran through a 
prospective new UN Security Council resolution on Iran 
or any subsequent coordinated national measures against 
Iran. 
 
-- Note that while these designations are a result of 
the IRGCs proliferation activities, the IRGCs growing 
presence in Irans financial and commercial sectors; its 
extensive economic interests in the defense production, 
construction, and oil industries; its support for 
terrorist groups; and its gross violations of human 
rights during recent protests mean that host governments 
should take appropriate steps to end any activities with 
the IRGC and its related entities.

BACKGROUND AND NONPAPER

¶4.  (U) Begin text of non-paper: 
 
Media Note 
 
Treasury Targets Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
 
On February 10, 2010, the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury took further action to implement existing U.S. 
sanctions against Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
 
STATE 00015554  002 OF 003 
 
SUBJECT: DESIGNATION OF FOUR ENTITIES AND ONE INDIVIDUAL 
RELATED TO IRANS ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS 
(IRGC) UNDER E.O. 133 
Corps (IRGC) by designating an individual and four 
companies affiliated with the IRGC pursuant to Executive 
Order (E.O.) 13382, which freezes the assets of 
designated proliferators of weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD) and their supporters. This action focuses in 
particular on Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters, 
an arm of the IRGC designated pursuant to 
E.O. 13382 in 2007. 
 
These designations include IRGC General Rostam Qasemi, 
who is also the commander of Khatam al-Anbiya 
Construction Headquarters, the engineering arm of the 
IRGC that serves to help the IRGC generate income and 
fund its operations.  Khatam al-Anbiya is owned or 
controlled by the IRGC and is involved in the 
construction of streets, highways, tunnels, water 
conveyance projects, agricultural restoration projects, 
and pipelines. Treasury also today designated four 
companies that are owned or controlled by, or that act 
on behalf of, Khatam al-Anbiya. 
 
As the IRGC consolidates control over broad swaths of 
the Iranian economy, displacing ordinary Iranian 
businessmen in favor of a select group of insiders, it 
is hiding behind companies like Khatam al-Anbiya and its 
affiliates to maintain vital ties to the outside world, 
said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial 
Intelligence Stuart Levey. Todays action exposing 
Khatam al-Anbiya subsidiaries will help firms worldwide 
avoid business that ultimately benefits the IRGC and its 
dangerous activities. 
 
The following are subsidiary companies that are owned or 
controlled by Khatam al-Anbiya, or that act on its 
behalf, and directly support various mining and 
engineering projects: 
 
-- Fater Engineering Institute 
-- Imensazen Consultant Engineers Institute (ICEI) 
-- Makin Institute 
-- Rahab Institute 
 
The IRGC has a growing presence in Irans financial and 
commercial sectors and extensive economic interests in 
the defense production, construction, and oil 
industries, controlling billions of dollars of business. 
The profits from these activities are available to 
support the full range of the IRGCs illicit activities, 
including WMD proliferation and support for terrorism. 
 
The U.S. has previously acted against the IRGC and the 
IRGC-Qods Force for their involvement in proliferation 
and terrorism support activities, respectively. In joint 
actions on October 25, 2007, the State Department 
designated the IRGC, under E.O. 13382, for having 
engaged, or attempted to engage, in proliferation- 
related activities, and Treasury designated the IRGC- 
Qods Force pursuant to E.O. 13224 for providing material 
support to the Taliban and other terrorist 
organizations.  Treasury at that time also designated 
nine IRGC-affiliated entities, including Khatam al- 
Anbiya, and five IRGC-affiliated individuals as 
derivative designations of the IRGC. Those entities and 
individuals are: 
 
-- Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarters 
-- Oriental Oil Kish 
-- Ghorb Nooh 
-- Sahel Consultant Engineering 
-- Ghorb-e Karbala 
-- Sepasad Engineering Co 
-- Omran Sahel 
-- Hara Company 
-- Gharargahe Sazandegi Ghaem 
-- General Hosein Salimi, Commander of the Air Force, 
IRGC 
-- Brigadier General Morteza Rezaie, Deputy Commander of 
the IRGC 
-- Vice Admiral Ali Akhbar Ahmadian, in his former 
capacity as Chief of the IRGC Joint Staff 
-- Brigadier Gen. Mohammad Hejazi, in his former 
capacity as Commander of Basij resistance force 
-- Brigadier General Qasem Soleimani, Commander of the 
Qods Force 
 
Elements of the IRGC have also been designated for UN 
sanctions pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions 
(UNSCRs) 1737 and 1747. All UN Member States are 
required to freeze the assets of entities and 
individuals listed in the Annexes of those resolutions, 
or designated by the UNSCR 1737 Committee, as well as 
 
STATE 00015554  003 OF 003 
 
SUBJECT: DESIGNATION OF FOUR ENTITIES AND ONE INDIVIDUAL 
RELATED TO IRANS ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS 
(IRGC) UNDER E.O. 133 
assets of entities owned or controlled by them or by 
persons or entities acting on their behalf or at their 
direction and to prevent funds or economic resources 
from being made available for their benefit. The 
European Union has also designated IRGC-affiliated 
companies, including Khatam al-Anbiya, for their support 
to Iranian ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
