¶1. (SBU) Summary:  An East Java pesantren (religious boarding 
school) launched a local radio station designed to support 
Islamic teaching and values drawing on programming relayed 
directly from Al-Ahqhof University in Yemen.  The Rector and 
Indonesian alumni of Al-Ahqhof University attended the station's 
January 26 launch.  The Rector told the press that the station 
would help "provide information of Islamic development so that 
the Muslim Community will not be confused by global issues 
raised by Western countries."  Published programming schedules 
offer discussions of books common to the study of Islam, however 
we are not yet able to comment on the tenor or tone of the 
broadcasts.  We will continue to monitor.  ConGen staff  have 
visited the Mambaus Sholihin Pesantren, located an hour outside 
Surabaya, on a number of occasions.  End Summary. 
 
Yemen Connection 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Pondok Pesantren Mambaus Sholihin, an Islamic 
boarding school in Gresik, just north of Surabaya, has operated 
a local radio station for the past year.  On January 26, the 
radio station launched a new Islamic format, designed to support 
Islamic teaching and values.  The Kiai (religious leader) of the 
pesantren explained that, in addition to broadcasting 
Islamic/Arabic songs rather than Indonesia songs, the new "Madu 
Yemen Mambaus Sholihin" station would relay directly programming 
for Al-Ahqhof University in Yemen.  Although the station's range 
is currently limited, the pesantren is building a new radio 
tower to expand coverage throughout East Java. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The pesantren took advantage of a 12-day visit to 
Indonesia of Prof. Dr. Al Habib Al Allamah Ustad Abdullah 
Muhammad Baharun Yemeni, the rector of Al-Ahqhof University to 
officially launch the new station.  The rector was accompanied 
by 100 Indonesian alumni from Al Ahqhof.  Approximately 30 
alumni of the Mambaus Sholihin pesantren are currently studying 
at Al-Ahqhof.  The rector told the media that the radio station 
would become a channel for information between Yemen and Gresik 
because Gresik has great potential for Muslim intellectual 
development along with its industrial development.  "Muslims can 
provide information on Islamic development so that the Muslim 
community will not be confused by global issues raised by 
Western countries," he said. 
 
Programming 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Although the station's range does not yet include 
Surabaya, the station's website (www.radiomadufm.com) includes 
links designed to allow listeners outside the broadcast area to 
hear the programming.   The site's schedule advertizes 
Yemeni-based programming focused primarily on discussions of 
books common to the study of Islam.  For example, one program 
discusses "Riyadushalihin," a book that contains "Hadis Shohih" 
about the words and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad.  Another 
discusses "Ta'lim Mutaa'lim" ("An Instruction for Students") 
which includes mandatory instructions for Muslims to study. 
Other radio programming is entitled:  the "History of the 
Prophet Muhammad," the "Biography of Ulamas," "Nahwu" (the 
grammar of the Koran), and "Sunnah Bid'ah" (Sunnah = Islamic 
teachings based on the Prophet's words and deeds; Bid'ah = 
Islamic teachings not based on the Prophet's words and deeds.) 
We don't yet have an indication of the tone or tenor of the 
broadcasts, but will continue to followup. 
 
Pesantren Background 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) ConGen staff have visited the Mambaus Sholihin 
Pesantren on a number of occasions, most recently for a 
discussion about the Indonesian education system with members of 
the Peace Corps.   Throughout our engagement, the pesantren 
community has always expressed openness to the discussion of 
differing ideas and experiences. The pesantrean's owner and 
religious leader, Kiai Masbuhin Faqih, is a member of Nadhatul 
Ulama (NU), the largest moderate Muslim organization in 
Indonesia, although the pesantren itself is not affiliated 
directly with NU. Until two years ago, the pesantren received 
most of its funding from the Middle East.  In recent years, the 
pesantren has begun accepting donations from Indonesian sources. 
 According to a teacher at Mambaus Sholihin, Kiai Masbuhin Faqih 
 
SURABAYA 00000012  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
is the sole owner of the radio station.
