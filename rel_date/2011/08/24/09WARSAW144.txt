BEGIN TEXT 
DPT I 40-8--2006/JTW/20 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Polish Republic 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States 
of America in Warsaw and has the honor to inform the Embassy 
that on January 15, 2009 the Council of Ministers of the 
Polish Republic passed six resolutions regarding approval of 
resources agreed by the respective Consultative Meetings of 
the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, which took place during 
the period 2002-2007.  The Ministry informs the Embassy that 
the Polish Republic has fulfilled all the necessary 
conditions required by Polish law for binding commitments to 
the aforementioned resources, according to the provisions of 
Article X, point 4 of the Treaty mentioned above. 
 
Taking into consideration that the Government of the United 
States of America is the depositary of the Antarctic Treaty, 
the Embassy of the Polish Republic in Washington will soon 
submit official notification to this effect to the Department 
of State. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Polish Republic takes 
this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the United States 
of America in Warsaw the assurances of its highest 
consideration.
