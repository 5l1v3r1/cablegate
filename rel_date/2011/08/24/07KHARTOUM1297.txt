¶1.  Summary:  The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA) reports that recent Darfur nutrition survey results 
indicate the first significant increase in malnutrition in the 
region since 2004.  According to USAID partner the UN Children's 
Fund (UNICEF), six localized nutrition surveys conducted in May and 
June -- two in North Darfur, three in South Darfur, and one in West 
Darfur -- found global acute malnutrition (GAM) rates above the 
emergency threshold of 15 percent.  In three of the six surveys, 
rates were above 2006 levels.  Although exact causes for the 
increased rates require further investigation, UNICEF identified 
population movement, persistent insecurity resulting in diminished 
beneficiary access to services, and inadequate water and sanitation 
services as contributing factors. 
 
¶2.  Humanitarian agencies continue to provide essential health and 
nutrition services and adjust response efforts to meet increased 
needs.  USAID funds nutrition programs in all three Darfur states 
through implementing partners Action Contre la Faim (ACF), Save the 
Children/United States (SC/US), Relief International, GOAL, and 
UNICEF.  End summary.

LOCALIZED NUTRITION SURVEY RESULTS 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  On August 1, UNICEF released the results of six localized 
nutrition surveys conducted in Kabkabiya, Abu Shouk and As Salaam 
internally displaced person (IDP) camps, Al Salam IDP camp, Otash 
IDP camp, Kass, and El Geneina town and IDP camps, indicating GAM 
rates above the emergency threshold of 15 percent.  While an 
increase in GAM rates is in line with seasonal trends, survey 
results for three locations in North and West Darfur were higher 
than 2006 levels.  For the three surveys conducted in South Darfur, 
comparable 2006 data was not available.  UNICEF has also observed a 
recent increase in supplementary feeding center (SFC) admissions for 
moderate malnutrition and an increase in therapeutic feeding center 
(TFC) admissions for treatment of severe malnutrition in Darfur. 
Recent survey results indicate the first significant increase in 
malnutrition in the Darfur region since late 2004, according to 
OCHA.

CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 
-------------------- 
 
¶4.  UNICEF and partners are further investigating underlying causes 
for the increase in malnutrition rates, but have highlighted 
insecurity, population movements, and inadequate water and 
sanitation conditions as contributing factors.  UNICEF emphasized 
the role of insecurity in preventing humanitarian agencies from 
providing sustained, quality services in program areas, as well as 
reducing beneficiary access to existing health and nutrition 
services. 
 
UNICEF also noted the impact of the Sudanese government ban on the 
use of F100 and F75 therapeutic milk, following quality concerns of 
stocks in Khartoum.  Although the temporary ban from April 7 to July 
4 was not systematically applied, UNICEF reported increased rates of 
diarrheal disease where therapeutic milks were not being used.

HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE 
--------------------- 
 
¶5.  Humanitarian agencies continue to provide essential health and 
nutrition services and adjust response efforts to meet increased 
needs.  In Al Salam IDP camp in South Darfur, USAID partner ACF has 
expanded its SFC to serve 500 beneficiaries per week and its 
outpatient therapeutic program to serve 250 severely malnourished 
children per week.  USAID funds nutrition programs in all three 
Darfur states through implementing partners ACF, SC/US, Relief 
International, GOAL, and UNICEF.  Despite sufficient funds to 
support emergency interventions, UNICEF notes that insecurity 
prevents access to certain areas and fewer organizations are 
currently working in the nutrition sector than in 2006. 
 
¶6.  UNICEF is undertaking a thorough review of all nutrition 
information to identify gaps and underlying causes of the decline. 
In addition, from August 11 to September 10, interagency assessments 
are being conducted in the region as part of the annual emergency

food security and nutrition assessment, with results expected in 
mid-October.  In September, a USAID/OFDA and Centers for Disease 
Control nutrition specialist will be deployed to Darfur to assess 
the overall nutrition situation and inform USAID programming 
response to emerging nutrition needs.
