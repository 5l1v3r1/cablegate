SUBJECT:  Consular Agent's 2003 Evaluations and Step 
Increases 
 
¶1. Post recently realized that, due to an internal 
processing error, our consular agents' evaluations in the 
year 2003 were not properly submitted and, consequently, 
the employees did not receive the step increase they 
should have earned that year. 
 
¶2. Our files show that in the year 2003 only one consular 
agent's evaluation was properly completed while all the 
other five were prepared and signed by the Counselor for 
Consular Affairs but were never processed.  All of the 
agents did perform at the satisfactory or better level 
that year. 
 
¶3. We were unaware of the situation until recently 
because the Consular Agents do not have access to 
Intranet and have difficulty accessing their pay records. 
Our consular agents' pay records are also inaccessible 
to Madrid HR and CONS. 
 
¶4. We have now completed all six 2003 evaluations and 
will be sending the originals and faxing copies to CA 
requesting that concurrence be granted to our 
recommendation to give the consular agents the 
appropriate retroactive step increases.
