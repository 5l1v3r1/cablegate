¶1.  THE OFFICE OF FORMER AFGHAN KING ZAHIR SHAH RELEASED THE 
FOLLOWING STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS ON MARCH 8, DESPITE THE 
DATE OF MARCH 7 THAT APPEARS ON THE STATEMENTS THEMSELVES. 
(COMMENT:  THE KING'S OFFICE DID NOT HAVE CONTACT INFO FOR 
MANY JOURNALISTS/MEDIA OUTLETS, SO IT IS LIKELY THAT THE 
STATEMENTS DID NOT RECEIVE WIDE DISTRIBUTION.  END COMMENT.) 
THE AFGHANS REQUESTED THAT WE "SEND THE STATEMENTS TO ANYONE 
WE WISHED" (PA ENSURED THAT ANSA AND "LA STAMPA" RECEIVED THE 
INFORMATION) AND ALSO THAT WE PASS THEM TO THE DEPARTMENT.
