SUBJECT: THE GAMBIA: EXPANSION OF CIVPOL CONTINGENT IN 
DARFUR 
 
REF: 05 BANJUL 683 ET AL 
 
¶1. (U) Interior Minister informed us that the GOTG has 
expanded its civpol contingent in Darfur from 29 to 96 
persons, reporting that the additional 67 police officers 
departed for Sudan in recent days.  Besides the civpol 
contribution, the Gambian contingent in Darfur includes 196 
troops and a handful of military observers. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: As previously reported (reftel), some 
months ago the AU approached the GOTG about possibly 
expanding its troop contingent from company to battalion 
size.  Gambian officials indicate a readiness to increase the 
Darfur contingent to a battalion in 2007, but that doing so 
in 2006 is not feasible due to the Gambian military's 
domestic security related duties this year in connection with 
the July AU summit and October presidential elections. END 
COMMENT.
