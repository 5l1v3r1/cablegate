¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Mission delivered reftel message 
outlining USG views on the way forward for the UN Mission in 
Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) to GOI interlocutors on July 24. 
 They took note of our views and promised to consider them as 
Indonesia formulated its position on the matter.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Pol/C delivered reftel message to Bunyan Saptomo, 
Director for North American Affairs at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DEPLU), on July 24.  Poloff also raised the 
issue with Fikry Cassidy, DEPLU's Deputy Director for 
International Security and Disarmament Affairs, the office 
responsible for UNSC matters. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Emboffs underscored that UNMEE could no longer 
function effectively given that neither Ethiopia nor Eritrea 
supported it.  Therefore, the United States would not support 
a roll-over of UNMEE.  The USG would instead urge the 
Secretary General to work with Ethiopia and Eritrea to find a 
way for the United Nations to support their normalized 
relations.  We urged Indonesia to adopt this position. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) DEPLU interlocutors said Indonesia had not yet 
formulated a position on this issue.  They promised to 
consider USG views as GOI officials decided how to move 
forward.
