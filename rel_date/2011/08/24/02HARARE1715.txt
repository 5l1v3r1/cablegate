SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT MUDIWA TRIAL REFERRED TO SUPREME 
COURT; HARARE 
 
 
The trial of "Daily News" reporter Lloyd Mudiwa and his 
editor Geoffrey Nyarota has been referred to the country's 
Supreme Court.  A Zimbabwean magistrate, Sandra Nhau, 
yesterday (July 24) agreed with defense lawyers that the 
case raised "serious constitutional matters."  Mudiwa and 
Nyarota are facing charges of publishing a false story 
under the newly enacted Access to Information and 
Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA).  Last week a magistrate 
acquitted Andrew Meldrum, a U. S. national reporting for 
the British-based "Guardian" newspaper, of similar charges.
