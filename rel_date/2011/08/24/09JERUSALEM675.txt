Main Stories: 
------------- 
All dailies lead with news of thousands of Muslims entering the 
Jerusalem Al-Aqsa mosque compound on April 16 to successfully 
prevent "extremist Jewish groups" from making good on earlier 
promises to "break into" the compound. Papers note that several 
Palestinian Authority officials and religious figures "joined the 
people" at the mosque.  Papers further note that Israeli police 
prevented young Muslim men from praying inside the compound. 
 
All dailies front page coverage on Special Envoy Mitchell's meetings 
with Israeli officials on April 16.  The reports highlight 
Mitchell's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, running 
comments by Mitchell stating that the U.S. supports the two-state 
solution and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, 
living in peace with Israel.  Such resolution would contribute to 
regional peace, according to Mitchell.  Al Ayyam runs a front page 
photo of Mitchell and Netanyahu.  Al Hayat Al Jadida front pages a 
photo of Mitchell speaking at the Tel Aviv press conference. 
Reporting further notes that Netanyahu called on Palestinians, 
during the press conference, to recognize Israel as a Jewish state 
before any negotiations can begin. Netanyahu clarified that Israel 
does not want to control Palestinians but rather maintain security. 
All papers note that Netanyahu did not make mention of the two-state 
solution.  Papers also run statements by Israeli Foreign Minister 
Lieberman about Annapolis "reaching a dead end" and Israel's desire 
to assist in strengthening the Palestinian economy.  Lieberman also 
called on the international community to remain fully committed to 
Israel's security and denounce Hamas, according to coverage. 
All front pages note Palestinian reaction to April 16 comments made 
by Israeli officials regarding the peace process.  Palestinian 
Authority spokesperson, Nabil Abu Rudaynah called Israeli positions 
"obstacles" to the two-state solution and a rejection of 
international standards, the Road Map and the Annapolis agreement. 
 
 
Al-Quds runs separate front page coverage citing Israeli daily 
Yedeoth Ahronoth, about U.S. efforts to end the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict running parallel to U.S. efforts to address the Iranian 
nuclear threat.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, 
"What does Lieberman want?"(04/17):  "Reading between the lines, we 
see that statements by [Israeli Foreign Minister] Lieberman [during 
his meeting with Special Envoy Mitchell], are as duplicitous as the 
man is himself... He turns his back on the peace process and calls 
on the international community to legitimize the various Israeli 
policies imposed on the Palestinian Territories, including the 
expansion of settlements and demolition of homes...  Therefore, 
President Obama has a responsibility to expose this duplicitous 
behavior and make Israel end occupation and dismantle settlements so 
that Palestinians can live in dignity and peace like other peoples 
throughout the world." 
 
2) Samih Shabib opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "How can we contain Netanyahu's government?" (04/17):  "How 
should the Palestinians confront the Netanyahu government?  Is an 
official Palestinian condemnation enough, one that states, "we will 
not deal with this government which is an obstacle to peace?"  This 
is not enough.  Israel must be compelled to meet some of the 
conditions laid out in the Annapolis agreement and dismantle

settlements... a clear and unified Arab position is also needed to 
pressure Israel, but it must be coupled with a unified Palestinian 
position."
