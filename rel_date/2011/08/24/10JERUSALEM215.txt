SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (02/05): Fatah and Hamas leaders 
continue to take steps towards reconciliation 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
-------------The three dailies run lead photos of Fatah Central 
Committee member Nabil Shaath shaking hands with Hamas' Ismail 
Hannieyh at his house in Gaza yesterday. Reports note that the 
meeting was positive. The leading headlines state that Fatah and 
Hamas will take practical steps to end the state of division. 
Al-Quds' headline also says that 1000 Fatah members and independent 
figures will visit Gaza soon. 
 
The dailies report that settlers in southern Nablus occupied 500 
dunums of land on a hill near Jaloud village and built four mobile 
homes on it. The dailies also report that the Jerusalem municipality 
will demolish 200 Palestinian homes in the Silwan neighborhood in 
East Jerusalem due to the lack of building permits. 
 
Independent daily Al-Quds reports that the Palestinian Authority and 
Palestinian officials are still reviewing the proposals submitted by 
Special Envoy George Mitchell to resume peace talks between the 
Palestinians and Israelis. The reports note that PLO Chief 
Negotiator Saeb Erekat met with Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser 
Joudeh and Egyptian Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit in Cairo to discuss 
their response to the proposals. 
 
The local press, including social media sites from the West Banka 
and Gaza, prominently highlight yesterday's announcement that the US 
made an initial contribution of $40 million to UNRWA. The dailies 
run photos of Consul General Daniel Rubinstein and UNRWA 
Commissioner General Filippo Grandi signing the agreement at the 
Dheisheh refugee camp. The Consul General is quoted noting the 
importance of providing robust and early contributions to UNRWA in 
light of the agency's anticipated funding deficit for 2010.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Under the title "A Sign of Hope and A Courageous Step" an editorial 
in Al-Quds argues that the Palestinians are tired of the state of 
division and its repercussions. The author urges Hamas and Fatah 
leaders to take this opportunity now to regain national unity.

Palestinian Cyberspace: 
----------------------- 
A blog by Zahi Khouri, Chief Executive of the Palestinian National 
Beverage Company, was circulated on Palestinian cyberspace. Mr. 
Khoury is blogging in his role as a member of the Palestinian 
Presidential Committee for Christian Affairs, who this week met in 
Washington with church leaders, members of Congress, and civil 
society leaders. The blog is titled 'National Prayer Breakfast: 
Israeli occupation threatens Christian presence in Holy Land' 
saying, "Israelis and Palestinians both want, and deserve, peace, 
security and prosperity, but one group cannot have them at the 
expense of the other...We believe that it is not too late. But the 
United States and the international community must take action. As 
Palestinians and as Christians, we call on President Obama and all 
Americans to demonstrate the values that have made the United States 
so admired around the world by supporting freedom and justice for 
our people."
