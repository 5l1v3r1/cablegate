SUBJECT: PIR GAILANI: AUGUST ELECTION OKAY ONLY IF KARZAI 
NOT CANDIDATE 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Fresh from a Palace election date 
discussion, Pir Gailani, head of the politically and 
religiously influential Gailani family, told the Charge on 
2/24 that he and other political leaders would support 
President Karzai staying in office until an 8/20 election 
only if Karzai announced he would not run for re-election. 
Responding to the Charge's point that Karzai is both likely 
to and has the right to run for a second term, Gailani said 
he would work with other political leaders to find another 
solution.  Gailani acknowledged security conditions preclude 
holding a legitimate election before 5/22. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Karzai convened a 2/24 meeting at the Palace 
attended by, among others, First VP Massoud, Second VP 
Khalili, Lower House Speaker Qanooni, Upper House Speaker 
Mojaddedi, MP Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, Independent Election 
Commission Chair Ludin and Gailani.  Karzai announced there 
that if he were to step down on 5/22, elections would have to 
take place in April, to avoid a gap in the presidency. 
Gailani claimed all attendees except for Dr. Ludin supported 
Karzai's plan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Gailani contended that if the election were held in 
August, Karzai would use his position as incumbent to the 
disadvantage of other candidates.  Responding to the Charge's 
question how Karzai's incumbency was a problem for an August 
election but not a May election, Gailani acknowledged Karzai 
would undoubtedly win a spring election because no other 
candidates are prepared.  The solution was for Karzai not to 
run for re-election, he reiterated. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Charge outlined the U.S. position: resolution of the 
executive authority issue required Afghan political leaders 
(including Karzai and key opposition leaders) to work 
together to find an agreed-to political solution.  The United 
States would advocate no specific outcome, but would insist 
the eventual solution preserve the 8/20 election, maintain a 
strong government during the peak fighting season, and 
support the authority and goals of the Constitution.  Charge 
also told Gailani the USG will review its relationship with 
all political parties in light of their efforts to resolve 
this situation.  Gailani acknowledged this point, saying "if 
our international friends do not support us we will not 
succeed" and "a car without gas cannot run." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Gailani plans to assemble a group of political 
leaders including the speakers of both houses of parliament 
next week to resolve the election date and presidential 
continuity issues.  The best outcome of this discussion would 
be a parliamentary announcement preserving the 8/20 election 
date and detailing a politically satisfactory answer to the 
presidential continuity issue, Gailani said.
