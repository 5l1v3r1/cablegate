¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Post's Assistance Coordination Working 
Group continues to monitor and organize assistance to the GOI 
following the October 25 bombings.  Delivery of laptops and 
other equipment to the Higher Judicial Council (HJC) will 
allow it to become functional by November 1. The Ministry of 
Justice (MOJ) continues to assess the damage and seek 
temporary work space but hopes to begin headquarters 
operations within a week. The United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees in Iraq (UNHCR) and International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) have provided emergency kits 
to families living near the bomb site and will assist in 
housing repairs. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) INL has expedited existing programming to improve 
computer connectivity and data management for the HJC and 
MOJ. INL has also offered emergency work space and office 
supplies to the MOJ IT staff who are currently seeking 
reestablishment of their office.  20 laptops will be 
delivered to the Karkh Appellate Courthouse (temporary 
quarters for the HJC) on October 31, aimed at making the HJC 
functional and operational by November 1. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The MOJ building (which also houses the HJC 
headquarters) suffered the most damage in the bombings. In a 
 
meeting with Minister of Justice Dara on the evening of 
October 29, he told us all floors of the MOJ building were 
severely damaged, with many cracked floors and dropped 
ceilings. Dara has been making the rounds at various 
hospitals to visit injured staff. Dara also told us the DG 
for Gazettes was seriously injured when he was blown out of 
his second story office and landed in his chair on the 
traffic circle. He remains in critical condition. 
Electricity, plumbing, and utilities are down.  MOJ is 
currently reviewing the National Security Council Building 
and Real Estate and Registrar Office for use as temporary 
work space and hopes to restart ministerial headquarters 
operations within a week.  MOJ has set up a table on the 
first floor of its building to handle employee concerns about 
the missing and injured.  Gulf Region Division (GRD) 
engineers will begin structural assessments of the MOJ/HJC 
building next week. Dara said the greatest immediate needs 
were vehicles and laptops. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) USAID reported that the Ministry of Municipalities 
and Public Works (MMPW) has requested an infrastructure 
security protection assessment at their old Mansour compound 
for use as temporary work space. ITAO and the GRD are working 
to respond to this request. 
 
¶5.  (U) United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) 
and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA) reported no requests for humanitarian 
assistance from the GOI other than supplies of anesthetics. 
On October 27, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
in Iraq (UNHCR) made an assessment of 590 families who live 
near the bomb site and found 25 homes severely damaged, 150 
homes had minor damage, and 200 apartments suffered minor 
damage.  UNHCR -- in coordination with the Deputy Governor of 
Baghdad, members of the Baghdad Provincial Council, Ministry 
of Displacement and Migration, and the Baghdad Operations 
Command -- sent emergency non-food item (NFI) kits including 
blankets, gas stoves, plastic sheeting, kitchen sets, hygiene 
kits and lanterns, to 590 affected families. UNHCR will also 
assist with necessary repairs. International Organization for 
Migration (IOM) also has household NFIs available if needed. 
QMigration (IOM) also has household NFIs available if needed. 
IOM reported that more than 75 shops were damaged, suffering 
broken windows and roofs, and is prepared to assist with 
repairs.
