SUBJECT: POINTS FOR TUESDAY AUGUST 26 SOMALIA BRIEFING 
 
¶1. Mission may draw on the following in Security Council 
consultations on Somalia on August 26, 2008. 
 
¶2.  Mr. President, this council meets today to consult on the 
way forward toward a more peaceful Somalia.  I would like to 
make four points. 
 
First, this Council asked, in its Resolution 1814 in May of 
this year, for the Secretariat to prepare an array of options 
for a possible UN peacekeeping operation in Somalia for the 
Council,s consideration.  The Secretariat has yet to provide 
this Council with what we would consider the full array of 
options available. While we can consider the idea of a 
Multinational Force as an interim step to a UN peacekeeping 
operation, we do not want such a force to become a sine qua 
non to expeditious consideration of a UN force.  We are also 
aware that DPKO puts together peacekeeping operations and not 
multinational forces.  DPKO should focus its efforts on 
planning for possible options for a UN peacekeeping operation 
as the Council has requested on several occasions. The 
signing of the Djibouti Agreement signals the opening of a 
window of opportunity for peace in Somalia, and the 
international community must move quickly to take advantage 
of this window by creating, properly mandating and deploying 
a United Nations peacekeeping force to Somalia to create a 
climate of calm in which the Djibouti Agreement can fulfill 
its promise. In order to act quickly to take advantage of 
this window of opportunity, we must ask that DPKO produce, 
without delay, the array of options this council has 
requested. 
 
Second, the United States welcomes the August 18 signing of 
the Djibouti Agreement by representatives of the Transitional 
Federal Government and the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of 
Somalia.  The agreement starts the implementation phase of a 
process begun by the two signatories on June 9 to promote 
peace and stability in Somalia.  We thank the government of 
Djibouti for hosting these important talks, and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary General, Ahmedou 
Ould-Abdallah, for his leadership in facilitating them. 
 
Third, we continue to be appalled by the deplorable actions 
of Al-Shabaab and other extremist groups, particularly in 
their ongoing campaign to target humanitarian workers, UN 
personnel, and AMISOM for assassination and kidnappings. 
Those who commit these horrific acts must be held accountable 
for their actions. 
 
Fourth, the United States urges all parties in Somalia to 
seize this historic opportunity to establish peace and 
stability in Somalia.  We encourage all parties, whether 
signatories to the agreement or not, to adhere to its terms 
and engage in peaceful dialogue towards a lasting solution. 
The people of Somalia are tired of the long conflict that has 
ravaged their country, and desperately need stability and a 
more peaceful future.
