¶1. Summary.  The poorest country in the Middle East, Yemen is 
particularly affected by poverty.  34.8 of the population 
lives below the poverty line as defined by a UNDP index; 45 
percent of the population lives on less than two dollars a 
day.  The real losers when it comes to poverty are the 
war-afflicted, northern governorates of Amran and Sa'ada. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. With an economy more similar to sub-Saharan Africa than to 
the rest of the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen suffers from levels 
of poverty rivaling some of the Least Developed Countries 
(LDCs).  34.8 of the population lives below the poverty line 
as defined by a UNDP index; 45 percent of the population 
lives on under two dollars a day.  Poverty is particularly 
concentrated in rural areas, where 84 percent of the poor 
live.  High levels of poverty have basic life consequences: 
malnutrition is rampant, and death during childbirth is 
common.  According to UNICEF's Chief of Communication and 
Information Naseem-ur-Rehman, 250 Yemeni children die per day 
from malnutrition alone, and twelve Yemeni women die every 
day in childbirth. 
 
¶3.  According to UNDP and the ROYG's Social Fund for 
Development (SFD), levels of poverty differ significantly 
across the governorates.  With 71 percent of the population 
poor, poverty reaches the highest levels in Amran, a 
governorate bordering the war-torn Sa'ada governorate. 
Malnutrition is at its worst in Sa'ada, where 60 percent of 
the population is malnourished, according to UNICEF. 
(Comment: Poverty levels in Sa'ada are lower than in 
geographically isolated Amran due to Sa'ada's connection to 
trade along the Saudi border.  Because of the ongoing 
conflict, poverty has mounted in Sa'ada, perhaps to levels 
rivaling those in Amran.  End Comment.)  In general, levels 
of poverty in southern Yemen are similar to levels of poverty 
in northern Yemen, excluding the war-afflicted governorates 
of Amran and Saada. 
 
¶4.  Comment: Despite popular perceptions in southern Yemen 
that they are worse off than their northern neighbors, in 
fact, levels of poverty do not differ significantly between 
northern and southern Yemen.  The real losers when it comes 
to poverty are the war-afflicted, northern governorates of 
Amran and Sa'ada.  Lack of basic services and goods in Sa'ada 
due to the ongoing Houthi conflict not only contributes to 
instability, but also adds to plight of the poor in the 
governorate.  End Comment.
