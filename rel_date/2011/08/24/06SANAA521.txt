Â¶1.  Ambassador met with newly appointed Minister of Legal 
Affairs, Adnan Omar al-Jefri, on February 26.  Ambassador

in balancing rights and responsibilities when drafting and 
enforcing laws and regulations, including the new draft press 
law. Al-Jefri stated that the Ministry will conduct outreach 
programs to educate the public about their rights under the

the USG may be able to assist in those efforts. Al-Jefri 
welcomed the idea of professional exchange and development 
programs with the American Bar Association and law school 
faculties in the United States.
