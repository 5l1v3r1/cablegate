TRADE BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL 
 
REF: A. STATE 118797 
     Â¶B. ASHGABAT 696 
 
The Arab League Trade Boycott of Israel does not impact U.S. 
firms or products in Turkmenistan (Ref A).  U.S. branded 
products are sold in Turkmenistan, although the majority are 
not imported directly from the U.S.  They are often produced 
in Turkey or Russia and then imported into Turkmenistan.  The 
GOTX has not made any public calls to support the boycott of 
trade with Israel.  Israeli companies have operated in 
Turkmenistan since 1993, including the Merhav Group which 
undertakes projects for the Turkmen Government that range 
from gas processing to agriculture.  In addition, the Israeli 
Government has diplomatic relations with Turkmenistan and 
plans to open an embassy in Ashgabat in the near future (Ref 
B).
