SUBJECT: GERMANY FORMULATING POSITION ON CSC 
 
REF: STATE 54213 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Global Affairs officer delivered reftel nonpaper 
and talking points on June 6 to the German Federal Ministry 
for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety 
(BMU) Specialized Working Group for Nuclear Safety Head of 
Division Ms. Ursula Adenauer and on June 11 to the German MFA 
Head of Unit for Nuclear Energy and Non-Proliferation 
Dietrich Becker.  Neither offered immediate responses to the 
nonpaper information, but indicated that Germany would 
carefully consider the CSC before taking an official position. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Becker welcomed the nonpaper information but 
expressed confusion as to the purpose and utility of the CSC 
given that Germany is already party to the Paris Convention 
of 1960 and Brussels Supplementary Convention of 1963. 
Becker admitted unfamiliarity with the legal nuances of the 
CSC provisions and said he would pass the nonpaper to Dr. 
Norbert Pelzer of the German University of Goettingen for 
further study and ask him to provide legal advice.  Pelzer 
has served as the MFA's legal advisor for nuclear law matters 
since 1970. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Adenauer said the BMU is aware that the United 
States deposited its instrument of ratification for the CSC 
with the IAEA on May 21, but noted that Germany has not yet 
taken an official position on the CSC.  Adenauer expressed 
appreciation for the information and stated a number of 
German ministries would have to take a close look at the CSC 
before offering any feedback. 
 
¶4.  Post will continue to follow up with German ministries 
and report any substantive German response septel.
