SUBJECT: GERMAN REACTION USG PROPOSAL TO EXPAND AND EXTEND 
THE G-8 GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP 
 
REF: STATE 60637 
 
¶1. (U) EMIN spoke with MFA Director General for Economics 
and Sustainable Development Peter Ammon May 11 and conveyed 
the points in ref on the proposal to expand and extend the 
Global Partnership Against Weapons and Materials of Mass 
Destruction.  (Note: Ammon is also the German Foreign Affairs 
Sous Sherpa in addition to overseeing activities relating to 
GP in the MFA.  End Note.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ammon said there was little enthusiasm in the 
German government regarding the current proposals to extend 
and expand the GP since, he said, there is still considerable 
room for the GP partners to fulfill their current levels of 
commitments.  Referring to notes, he said only about 1.8 
percent of what Japan pledged has been delivered upon; Canada 
has met about 20 percent of its commitments, and some states, 
he specified France, have not delivered on any of their 
commitments.  Figures available to him showed the U.S. at 
about 20 percent of its pledge.  Germany, he said, had 
pledged USD 1.5 billion and had dispersed Euro 400 million 
(about USD 540 million).  His sense was that it might be 
better to focus on using the money that is now pledged and in 
the pipeline.
