GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM STILL ALIVE 
-------------------------------- 
¶1.  (U) The National Popular Assembly (ANP) voted to 
schedule the Government's policy program for discussion, 
overturning a technical advisory board's decision, which 
tried to keep the program from being read by the full 
Assembly.  Fifty-one parliamentarians voted in favor, 
thirty-four against, and four abstained in the vote. 
Members are now reading the program and will deliberate 
and vote on approval later this month.  Approval of the 
program would be a major accomplishment for President 
Vieira and his embattled Prime Minister, Aristides Gomes, 
who the leadership of the fractured Party for the 
Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC) 
continues to denounce as an unconstitutional appointment 
despite a Supreme Court ruling to the contrary (Reftel). 
 
ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS 
----------------------- 
¶2.  (U) The Prime Minister sacked Justice Minister Dr. 
Namuano Dias on March 3 and replaced him with Dr. Braima 
Dafe to keep on track the corruption trial of Rene Barros, 
the former head of the state Electric and Water Company. 
Barros is accused of misappropriating about USD 79,000 (43 
million CFA).  Dias protested the detention of Barros, and 
threatened to hold up the trial, claiming there was no 
presumption of innocence. 
 
¶3.  (U) Other anti-corruption efforts moving forward 
include three separate trials that were opened by the 
previous Prime Minister, Carlos Gomes Jr. of the PAIGC. 
The current Prime Minister has reopened the cases, despite 
the fact that two of the three campaigned heavily for 
President Vieira. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT: With the recent visit of the World Bank 
to Bissau and an upcoming International Monetary Fund 
visit, it appears Vieira and Aristides Gomes are taking 
steps the international community wants to see with 
respect to anti-corruption efforts, even if it means going 
after their own supporters.  END COMMENT.
