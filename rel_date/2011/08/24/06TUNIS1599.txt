SUBJECT: USTR TIFA LETTER DELIVERED TO MDIC 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Ambassador Hudson paid a farewell call on 
Minister of Development and International Cooperation (MDIC) 
Mohamed Nouri Jouini on June 20, 2006.  The Ambassador 
delivered a letter from USTR concerning a proposed June 30, 
2006 meeting between the minister and Assistant United States 
Trade Representative (AUSTR) for Europe and the Middle East, 
Shaun Donnelly.  The Ambassador encouraged the minister to 
attend this meeting and emphasized the opportunity it 
provided to revitalize the Trade Investment Framework 
Agreement (TIFA) process.  The minister reacted positively, 
promising to review the contents of the letter and to reply 
by week's end.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Ambassador Hudson met with Minister Jouini on June 
20, 2006 and delivered AUSTR Donnelly's TIFA Preparation 
Committee letter.  The Ambassador stressed the importance of 
seizing this opportunity to dialogue with USG in order to 
move the TIFA process along.  He pointed out that the GOT 
responses to the U.S. position papers demonstrated that there 
are several areas where Tunisian regulations and practices 
differ from U.S. FTA standards.  The Ambassador informed the 
minister that AUSTR Donnelly is willing to meet with him plus 
1 or 2 staff on June 30th to discern areas of agreement and 
areas that require additional work.  Ambassador emphasized 
that the purpose of this meeting would be to lay the 
foundation for the working groups and charge them with 
specific tasks to address.  The intended outcome would set 
the preparation for another TIFA Council in the near future. 
Minister Jouini was receptive to this approach and stressed 
that dialogue was important.  The minister indicated that he 
would review the USTR letter and let the embassy know what he 
has decided by the end of the week.  On June 26, 2006 MDIC 
officials told Economic officer that the minister would be 
unable to attend the proposed TIFA meeting. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On June 26, MDIC officials told Econoff that 
Minister Jouini would be unable to attend the proposed June 
30, 2006 meeting nor the Arab Economic Forum in Houston 
taking place this week, as the minister is caught up in a 
ministerial conference concerning the Facility for 
Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP).  The 
conference is unexpectedly running longer than originally 
planned.  (Note: FEMIP is a financial partnership between the 
European Union and its Mediterranean neighbors aimed at 
helping these countries meet the challenges of economic and 
social modernization and enhancing regional integration.  The 
anticipated end result is the creation of a customs union 
with the European Union (EU) by 2010.  The Mediterranean 
Countries (Algeria, Egypt, Gaza/west Bank, Israel, Jordan, 
Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey) fear that funds 
are being diverted to new EU members in Eastern Europe and 
are calling for greater European investment in North Africa 
and the Middle East.  End Note.)  MDIC officials indicated 
that an official response letter will be delivered to AUSTR 
Donnelly via the MFA/Tunisian Embassy in D.C..  They hoped 
that later date for this TIFA Preparation meeting could be 
agreed upon.  MDIC officials also stressed that they need to 
invest some deep thought and concentration to the TIFA 
process in order to succeed in making some progress with this 
agreement.
