SUBJECT: CZECH SENATE GIVES FINAL APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION OF 
TROOPS IN IRAQ 
 
REF: PRAGUE 111 
 
The Czech Senate on Jan 27 overwhelmingly approved extension 
of the Czech military police contingent in Iraq through 2005. 
 The decision follows last week's lower house vote (reftel) 
and is the final step in the approval process.  Out of 72 
senators present, 69 voted in favor of the extension; two 
Communists and one Social Democrat opposed.  In addition to 
the 98 military police who are training Iraqi security forces 
near Basra, a ten-member army surgical team is also deployed 
to MNF-I through 2005.
