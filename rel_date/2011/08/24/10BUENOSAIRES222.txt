SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1.   Opinion articles about U.S. policy regarding Iran, Haiti, and 
China filled weekend newspapers in Argentina.  The Director of the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center in Buenos Aires warned against Iran's 
increasing influence in Latin America, which is "legitimizing" 
Iran's President.  Another article strongly praised U.S. relief 
efforts in Haiti, while Argentina's largest-circulation daily 
printed USAID Administrator Shah's opinion article highlighting 
U.S. assistance.  Additionally, a flurry of opinions dramatized the 
strained tensions between China and the U.S.  End summary. 
 
 
 
IRAN'S INCREASING SHADOW IN LATIN AMERICA 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶2.   Sergio Widder, Simon Wiesenthal Center's Director for Latin 
America, wrote an opinion article (2/19) in center-right Perfil 
headlined "Iran's shadow grows in Latin America."  Widder claims 
there is a "bloc of countries (allied to Iran) seeking to export 
the Iranian revolution," with Bolivia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua 
forming the core.  Widder writes that Venezuela's support for Iran 
included obstructing an investigation into the 1994 AMIA bombing in 
Buenos Aires after Argentina requested the extradition of former 
Iranian officials in connection with the investigation.  The 
article also voices opposition to Brazilian-Iranian cooperation, 
which is "legitimizing" the government of Iran's President 
Ahmadinejad.

U.S. EFFORTS IN HAITI 
 
--------------------- 
 
 
 
¶3.   Praising the "comprehensive approach and the determination" of 
U.S. actions in Haiti, Gilberto Rodrigues opined in Perfil (2/21) 
that Washington regained an image of leadership in "good causes" by 
"delivering a global message."  Rodrigues highlights the strong 
mobilization of non-governmental organizations in the U.S. that are 
helping Haiti's reconstruction.  However, Rodrigues also observes 
that due to the U.S., MINUSTAH "no longer plays the main role" in 
Haiti, and hopes that this change does not make Haiti "a new 
battleground for hemispheric hegemony."

the actions of the U.S. in Haiti.

INCREASED CONCERNS REGARDING U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
 
¶5.   Proclaiming that "Chinese fury starts new Cold War," Perfil 
published an article on 2/20 saying China "firmly condemned Obama's 
meeting with the Dalai Lama." Quoting Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ma Zhaoxu as saying the Washington meeting was "an 
intervention in Chinese internal affairs" and "hurt the China's 
feelings," the article notes Zhaoxu asked Washington to take steps 
to "eliminate the damaging" effects of the summit. In separate 
article with the headline "The Fourth World War," Perfil says it 
will be difficult to predict "how this new diplomatic row might 
end."

 &ed=0445 
 
 
 
¶6.   On 2/20, Clarin's correspondent in Beijing says Obama tried to 
downplay the Dalai Lama visit, by not receiving him in the Oval 
Office and not giving a press conference after the meeting. Clarin 
notes "those efforts were not enough" and China issued "tense 
statements," including a formal complaint to U.S. Ambassador to 
China Jon Huntsman.

¶7.   An opinion article in Clarin (2/20) referring to a "new 
bipolar" world states growing frictions between Beijing and 
Washington have "narrowed the possibility of synergy between both 
giants." The article, signed by journalist Marcelo Cantelmi, claims 
these tensions are the initial signs of a "phenomenal global 
readjustment," which has been sped up by the economic crisis. It 
highlights the "dropping relative strength of the U.S.," which 
generates conflicting signs for other interests close to the 
conflict, such as Iran and Israel.  Additionally, the article 
quotes a story in The Economist as saying the U.S. "is unprepared 
to negotiate from a position in which it lacks superiority."
