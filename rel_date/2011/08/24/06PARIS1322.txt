¶1. (U) Ambassador Stapleton had breakfast with Minister of 
Transport, Equipment, Infrastructure and Tourism Dominique 
Perben February 28.  The Minister was accompanied by his 
Diplomatic Advisor Jacques Beltran and his Counsellor for 
Aviation Olivier Berthelot.  Deputy Chief of Mission Karl 
Hofmann and Econoff were also present. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Perben began by describing his recent trip to the 
U.S., noting some concern about the opposition he detected on 
Capitol Hill to the proposed U.S./E.U. Open Skies Agreement. 
He hoped this would not derail the DOT rulemaking process on 
foreign investment and control of U.S. airlines, and 
consequently a possible approval for the agreement early this 
summer. He was personally supportive of the proposal, because 
he believed it would increase competition, and serve the 
cause of regional airports such as that of his native Lyon. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In response to our recent demarche on Air Navigation 
Service charges (ref A), Perben reaffirmed what Ministry 
officials had already told us (ref B): that the proposed 
Eurocontrol regulation would not affect the current French 
practice of exempting USG flights from charges.  On a 
separate issue, he also noted that he was closely following 
the certification of the A-380, the next step of which would 
be evacuation tests in Germany in March. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Perben noted he believed we enjoyed good cooperation 
on transportation security. The GOF was working on organizing 
a meeting to prepare the working group on transportation 
security suggested by Secretary Mineta in Tokyo.  Olivier 
Berthelot agreed, mentioning the proposed technical agreement 
on exchanges and cooperation between DGAC and TSA.  He hoped 
that better exchange of information might lead toward "mutual 
recognition" of the high levels of security in France and the 
U.S.  We noted that French security practices already had a 
good reputation, but that this did not affect the legal 
requirements for transportation security established by the 
USG. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Finally, Perben reiterated his invitation for 
Secretary Mineta to visit France this Spring, and promised to 
 
SIPDIS 
pass on information about possible dates.  He also expressed 
interest in having someone from DOT come to work in the 
Ministry, noting that a civil servant from MOT was already 
working at DOT.
