¶1. (SBU) Summary and Introduction:  President Cristina 
Fernandez de Kirchner (CFK) and her husband, former president 
Nestor Kirchner (NK), came out swinging against the United 
States -- she in Montevideo, he in Buenos Aires -- on 
December 18, hours before the Ambassador was scheduled to 
meet with FM Taiana at this summons.  Nestor Kirchner 
disputed the Ambassador's assertion that bilateral relations 
were positive, and said U.S. actions were "shameful."  End 
summary. 
 
Pouring Kerosene on the Fire 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) At the December 18 Mercosur summit in Montevideo, 
CFK reiterated her harsh criticism of the U.S. (reftels) for 
implicating her in the case of four Venezuelans and one 
Uruguayan charged with operating as unregistered foreign 
agents.  Repeating her line about the U.S. wanting 
"subordinate client states," she added, "They will not crush 
us, we will continue struggling for the deepening of 
Mercosur, we will continue lobbying for a multipolar world." 
 
¶3. (SBU) CFK said the top priority for Argentina's pro 
tempore presidency of Mercosur, which began at this summit, 
was the incorporation of the BRV into the customs union. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Without naming the United States, CFK said "there 
are some who make politics from within and from outside our 
countries who are those who make dirty politics and 
operations in the region."  She noted that Latin America had 
"managed to survive the neoliberal tragedy.  It managed to 
survive the adoption of neoliberal policies.  We were a 
laboratory, we were guinea pigs for policies designed to make 
the state disappear." 
 
The First Gentleman Surfaces 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Former president Nestor Kirchner used his first 
public remarks since leaving office to slam the United 
States, saying it was "shameful" what the U.S. was doing to 
Argentina, adding that "this is not a colony."  Like his 
wife's Mercosur statements, Kirchner's remarks at a December 
18 lunch for a local utility were immediately broadcast and 
reported on major media websites. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Recalling that the Ambassador had said "relations 
with Argentina are good," Kirchner countered, "I am saying to 
him that they are not good, with what they are doing to us." 
He reiterated GOA insinuations that the Miami arrests were 
motivated by Washington's concern about the creation of 
Chavez-inspired Banco del Sur, the consolidation of Mercosur, 
and Argentina's economic policy framework.  "They're also 
worried that we condemn terrorism but do not accept the 
violations of human rights such as those that occur at 
Guantanamo, which is shameful." 
 
¶7. (SBU) Calling again for the U.S. to extradite Antonini, 
Kirchner said, "Send us the fugitive.  Argentines want to 
know the truth about what happened."  Kirchner also said 
"Argentines are getting bruised by a bunch of gangsters."
