Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. 
 
We raised ratification of the SUA protocols with Hakan Abaci 
of the MFA's Maritime Department.  Abaci said Turkey shares 
the same goals as the U.S. and is keen to be among the first 
twelve nations to ratify the protocols.  He expressed some 
frustration over the slowness of the process within the 
Turkish administration: currently the protocols are still 
being translated into Turkish after which they will be sent 
to the Prime Ministry for final approval by the Government. 
After the Prime Ministry approval, the protocols will be 
submitted to Parliament for ratification.  Given the crush of 
legislation in the Parliament, Abaci was not confident the 
protocols would be passed before Parliament went on summer 
recess.
