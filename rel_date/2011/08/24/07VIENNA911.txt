IRANIAN EXPORT DENIALS 
 
REF: STATE 39585 
 
(U)  EconPolOff met on April 4 with Monika Froehler, the 
Deputy Head of the Ministry of European and International 
Affair's (MEIA) Office of Disarmament, Arms Control, and 
Export Controls.  Austria views the proposal to have Nuclear 
Suppliers Group (NSG) countries share their Iranian export 
denials with the IAEA, UNSC Sanctions Committee, and other 
non-NSG countries as valid.  Froehler said the GOA does not 
have a national policy on this, but that it did research to 
identify Austrian firms that do business with Iran (NFI). 
The GOA and is waiting for Brussels to make a decision on the 
proposal.  Froehler noted that the German EU Presidency 
supports sharing this information.  Froehler plans to confer 
with Alexander Marschik on the matter, who is the director of 
the MEIA's Nuclear Affairs office.  Post will report any 
substantive feedback from Marschik.
