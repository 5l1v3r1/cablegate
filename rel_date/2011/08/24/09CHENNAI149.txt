¶1.  (SBU) Summary: A representative of Sudarrshan Technical Services 
told us by telephone that his company's only relationship with the 
Israel-based Scope Metals Group (ref B) was a one-time proposed sale 
in 2008 to purchase stud nuts for aircraft for the Indian Air Force 
(described in ref A).  Scope was unable to provide the item when 
Sudarrshan ordered it in 2008, and Scope referred Sudarrshan to the 
U.S.-based ISO Group, who ultimately provided the product. 
Sudarrshan denied any ongoing relationship with Scope while offering 
that it might do business with Scope in the future if an opportunity 
arose.  We see no cause for concern about Sudarrshan or its 
activities at this point.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) We spoke with C. R. Sathya Narayan Rao of Sudarrshan 
Technical Services on May 12, 2009.  He said that the company was 
started in 2003, has eight employees, grossed INR 15,000,000 in 2008 
(USD 300,000), and is owned by Rao's wife and operated by Rao.  A 
quick Internet search showed that Sudarrshan's company website is 
"under construction" and that the company is registered with the 
U.S. Foreign Commercial Service in Bangalore. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Rao reported that his company's relationship with Scope 
Metals Group was a one-time affair, originating when Sudarrshan 
placed an order for stud nuts in 2008 and received a quote from 
them.  When delivery was delayed, Sudarrshan came to believe that 
Scope would be unable to provide the items.  Scope then referred 
Sudarrshan to ISO Group, which completed the sale in August 2008. 
No fees or commissions were paid by or to either company, according 
to Rao. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Mr. Rao told us that he is unaware of any Indian office 
for Scope and has had contact with them only via Scope's office in 
Israel.  He said that he could not explain why the license 
application listed Scope Metals Group at Sudarrshan's Bangalore 
address because he was not involved in the preparation of that 
document. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Rao told us that Sudarrshan had physical possession of the 
stud nuts for a short time, receiving them from ISO Group and then 
forwarding them to the Indian Air Force in their entirety.  Rao 
claimed familiarity with the regulations governing the import/export 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, noting that his company has dealt 
with other defense articles for aircraft before. 
 
¶6. (SBU) We did not visit Sudarrshan's facilities and can provide no 
additional information on the security of its facilities.  Rao was 
willing and able to answer our questions directly.  We see no cause 
at this point for USG concern about Sudarrshan Technical Services or 
its willingness/ability to operate with the scope of applicable laws 
and regulations.
