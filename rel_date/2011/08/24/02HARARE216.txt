¶1.   AFTER PUBLISHING AN ARTICLE AND EMBASSY-PLACED 
    "ADVERTORIAL" ABOUT DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING AND HIS 
    MESSAGE OF NONVIOLENCE, THE JANUARY 23 EDITION OF THE 
    GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY "THE HERALD" CARRIED AN 
    EDITORIAL IN CALLING FOR PEACE IN THE RUN-UP TO THE 
    MARCH 9 AND 10 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN ZIMBABWE. 
    UNDER HEADLINE "WE MUST ALL SUPPORT NON-VIOLENCE," THE 
    PAPER COMMENTS: 
 
¶2.   "AS POLITICAL VIOLENCE CONTINUES UNABATED 
    THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ALL EFFORTS MUST BE MADE TO 
    PRESERVE HUMAN LIFE AND STOP THE SITUATION FROM 
    DETERIORATING ANY FURTHER.  ZIMBABWEANS FROM ALL WALKS 
    OF LIFE, IRRESPECTIVE OF POLITICAL AFFILIATION, 
    RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL BACKGROUND NEED 
    JOIN HANDS AND SAY NO TO VIOLENCE. . .  IT IS INCUMBENT 
    UPON EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US TO ENCOURAGE A CULTURE OF 
    TOLERANCE BY SPEAKING OUT AGAINST THIS EVIL OF 
    VIOLENCE, WHICH HAS SO FAR CLAIMED SEVERAL VALUABLE 
    LIVES. . . ." 
 
    ¶3.  COMMENT: LAUDABLE AS THESE EDITORIAL 
    SENTIMENTS ARE, WE NOTE THAT THE GOVERNMENT- 
    CONTROLLED PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA CONSISTENTLY 
    BLAME THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT FOR DEMOCRATIC 
    CHANGE (MDC) PARTY FOR MOST OF THE POLITICAL 
    VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE.  GOVERNMENT MEDIA REPORTING 
    ON POLITICAL VIOLENCE IS STARKLY AT ODDS WITH THE 
    ASSESSMENT BY THE EMBASSY, AND OTHER NEUTRAL 
    OBSERVERS, THAT THE RULING ZANU-PF PARTY AND ITS 
    SUPPORTERS ARE THE LEADING SOURCE OF POLITICAL 
    VIOLENCE IN ZIMBABWE.
