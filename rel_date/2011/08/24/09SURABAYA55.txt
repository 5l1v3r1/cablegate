SUBJECT: METHANOL SPIKED "ARAK" RESULTS IN MULTIPLE DEATHS IN BALI 
 
¶1.  Indonesian authorities on the island of Bali have confirmed 
more than 50 cases of suspected methanol poisoning associated 
with consumption of apparent methanol-spiked "arak" (also 
referred to as "arrack").  Arak is a common home-brewed 
alcoholic beverage in Bali, but is also produced by a few local 
companies and has been seen for sale at the Bali International 
Airport.  Methanol is sometimes added to the beverage to 
increase its potency, although this is usually the case only 
with home-brewed arak.  The consumption of the methanol-spiked 
beverage has reportedly resulted in the death of more than 20 
persons since May 25, 2009.  Among those who are suspected to 
have died due to consumption of arak are one American citizen 
and three Europeans.  While most of the deaths have occurred in 
Bali, two of the Europeans died on the island of Lombok after 
drinking arak. 
 
¶2.  Authorities report that the deceased all displayed symptoms 
of acute alcohol poisoning.  While authorities have yet to 
determine the source(s) of the methanol tainted beverage(s), 
this is the largest known incidence of methanol poisoning in 
Bali.  While early indications point to methanol, a member of 
the medical staff at Sanglah Hospital in Bali noted that it 
takes about one week to receive conclusive results from the 
forensic laboratory.  It was also noted that some of the 
deceased displayed visible signs of lip irritation.  Police have 
reportedly ordered toxicology tests for all recent death cases 
in Bali. 
 
¶3.  Post sent a warden message on June 2, 2009, advising 
American Citizens to exercise extreme caution and to avoid 
consumption of arak liquor.  Post is not aware of any exports of 
alcoholic beverages from Bali, although arak is almost certainly 
purchased in Bali and carried elsewhere by travelers.  Post will 
continue to monitor the situation and will contact Indonesian 
customs officials as well as the Bali Department of Health to 
determine if company-produced arak is being removed from shelves 
and if arak is exported.
