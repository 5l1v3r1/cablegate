REF:  A) Berlin 828, B) Berlin 819 and previous. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 infections in Germany 
rose by 50 cases to a total of 691 on July 10.  Media reports 
indicate first case of H1N1 in the Federal State of Saarland. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The National Reference Center for Influenza at the 
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its press 
briefing July 10 a total of 50 new laboratory-confirmed cases 
of H1N1.  This increases the total number of virus cases in 
Germany to 691.   New cases were distributed among the federal 
states 
as follows: Bavaria (20), North Rhine-Westphalia (8), Baden- 
Wuerttemberg (8), Rhineland-Palatinate (5), Berlin (4), 
Schleswig-Holstein (3), Bremen (1), and Thuringia (1). 
 
¶3. (SBU)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the state with 
the highest number of virus cases among all German states with 
a total of 315, followed by Baden-Wuerttemberg (94) and 
Bavaria (87 cases).  Over half (381) of all confirmed 
infections in Germany have resulted from domestic 
transmission. 
 
First case of H1N1 in the Federal State of Saarland 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4. (SBU)  To date, the Federal State of Saarland remains the 
only state without confirmed virus cases.  However, media 
reports indicate a 24-year old woman from Saarland to be 
infected with the virus.  She returned from a trip to Mallorca 
(Spain) with flu-like symptoms and was tested positive for the 
virus.  However, RKI has not confirmed this case. 
 
Additional school closures 
----------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Media reported July 9 that several schools in 
Bavaria were closed due to confirmed H1N1 infections of 
students.  A school in Markt Schwaben was closed on Thursday 
and Friday after two 15-year old students were tested positive 
for the virus.  In addition, seven graders from another school 
in Neufarn were sent home on Wednesday after the virus was 
confirmed in a 13-year old student.  The student reportedly 
caught the virus from his father who returned from a trip to 
Chile and was confirmed to have the virus.
