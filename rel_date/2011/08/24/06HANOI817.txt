SUBJECT:  VIETNAM: NO COMMENT ON DARFUR PKO NOW 
 
REFS: STATE 51778 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: The MFA has not responded to our request 
to discuss the issue of troop and/or equipment support for a 
UN peacekeeping operation in Sudan.  The Ministry of Defense 
received reftel demarche without comment, but asked 
unofficially whether China will participate and what is the 
expected scope of the mission.  MND officials also noted 
that Vietnam's participation in any PKO mission will be 
complicated and will require a legislative change, which 
could be a time-consuming process.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) DATT Hanoi met Senior Colonel Nguyen Minh Huy, 
acting director of the America, Australia and Africa 
Department of the Ministry of Defense, April 10 to deliver 
reftel demarche.  Huy had no official response to the 
demarche, but asked DATT unofficially about the scope and 
size of the Darfur PKO mission and inquired if the Chinese 
would participate.  He also said that it "will take a lot of 
effort to coordinate" any effort to involve Vietnam in 
Darfur. 
 
¶3. (SBU) At an earlier event, the DATT raised the issue of 
peacekeeping with another MND official, who noted that 
Vietnamese law will have to be changed to permit Vietnamese 
troops to be stationed overseas.  That will be possible, the 
official said, since the National Assembly will do what the 
GVN requests, but it will take time and will have to occur 
during a National Assembly session, which could have an 
effect on the timing of a Vietnam contribution. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: The MFA is avoiding us on this one, for 
now at least, possibly out of concern that they not 
accidentally step into the MND's territory.  Sr. Col. Huy's 
question about China was a pointed one, sending the message 
that if the United States and China are not in agreement on 
the Darfur UN PKO mission, then Vietnam will likely not 
participate.  Because the upcoming 10th Party Congress has 
paralyzed most of Vietnam's policymaking apparatus, we may 
not receive a formal answer to this demarche before the UN's 
April 24 deadline.  End Comment.
