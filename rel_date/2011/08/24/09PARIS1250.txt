¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY: France concurs with a large part of U.S. 
key goals for the 12th session of the Human Rights Council 
(HRC) and solicits United States support for initiatives that 
they are sponsoring, according to MFA Assistant Director for 
Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs Cecile Vigneau, who 
spoke to poloffs on September 9 in response to reftel 
demarche.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Welcoming U.S. re-engagement with the HRC, Vigneau 
confirmed France's support for the continuation of the 
special procedural mandates for Somalia and Cambodia, but 
added there was more information forthcoming on Burundi.  If 
the third bi-annual review of the Strategic Framework's 
implementation of the UN Integrated Office for Burundi 
(BINUB) determined the need for continuing the mandate, 
France would support it.  On a Freedom of Expression 
resolution, Vigneau conveyed France's shared concerns about 
the Russian-sponsored traditional values resolution and noted 
that there is currently a Swedish text seeking a unified 
European Union policy on the issue.  She noted that the EU 
has not yet reached consensus on the language of the text, as 
the fundamental problem of the resolution to France is not 
the question of values but rather assuring universal human 
rights and freedoms.  Vigneau remarked that France 
anticipates the Russian resolution on the issue to be 
increasingly problematic. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  French priorities for the session include stressing 
the need to work together on the broad range of issues facing 
the HRC and to continue consulting frequently and regularly 
on a bilateral and regional level.  The GOF was pleased to 
hear that the U.S. supports the French/Colombian/Mexican 
initiative for the creation of a mechanism that would combat 
discriminatory laws against women.  Vigneau stated that 
France will also be working with Mexico on an initiative to 
reform the HRC and would appreciate a U.S. endorsement of the 
effort.  There is some concern that Russia may be trying to 
produce its own proposaal on HRC reform. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  France seeks U.S. support for adopting the French 
initiative on the Guiding Principles on Extreme Poverty and 
Human Rights.  Co-authored by Peru, Chile, Belgium, Albania, 
Romania, the Philippines, Morocco, and Senegal, Vigneau 
recounted that GOF had experienced much resistance on the 
part of South Africa initially but the two countries have had 
positive exchanges on the issue in the past year. 
Recognizing that the text of the initiative is long and 
complicated, France hopes that the draft guiding principles 
will gain passage with the support of the United States as 
well as Brazil, India, and China, who are also interested in 
the issue.  Additionally, Vigneau mentioned that the French 
support the British initiative on Burma that will be 
presented at the 12th session.
