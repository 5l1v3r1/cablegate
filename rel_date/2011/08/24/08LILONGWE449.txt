REF: STATE 079617 
 
¶1. (SBU) Charge Sullivan presented points in reftel demarche to 
Deputy Foreign Minister Henry Mumba July 29. Sullivan urged 
that when consulted by President Mbeki concerning his 
mediation efforts, the GOM advocate for a negotiated solution 
that reflected the will of the Zimbabwean people as expressed 
in the March 29 elections. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mumba replied that the GOM was pleased that talks were 
taking place and hopeful that they would lead to a real 
solution in Zimbabwe. He also hoped that when a solution was 
found, sanctions would be eased and international partners 
would quickly address Zimbabweans, dire economic situation. 
The Deputy Foreign Minister emphasized the GOM,s strong 
support for President Mbeki's leadership in the mediation, 
and said that Malawi would not make any public statements 
that would condition or undermine that support. Mumba 
remarked that it would difficult for outsiders to impose any 
elements of a solution on Zimbabwe, including who would serve 
as president. Mumba said that the most recent round of 
elections had officially resulted in President Mugabe,s 
reelection; while those results could be questioned, in the 
meantime Mugabe remained head of state. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Charge reiterated that from the USG's standpoint, no 
government should recognize the outcome of the second round 
of elections, which had been essentially nullified by the 
widely-recognized violence and intimidation against 
opposition leaders and supporters. Mumba took the point, but 
again argued that only Zimbabwean leaders could determine 
what specific political arrangements would be most 
appropriate at this juncture. In response to a question from 
Mumba, the Charge also provided that latest information 
concerning new U.S. sanctions against members of the Mugabe 
regime. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT: The GOM appears unlikely to take a forceful 
position with respect to Mugabe's participation in a unity 
government, and will instead probably stick to supporting 
whatever strategy Mbeki pursues.
