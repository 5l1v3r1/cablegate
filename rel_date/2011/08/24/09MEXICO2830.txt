 Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff raised reftel points with Julian Juarez 
Cadenas, the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs' (SRE) Director 
General for Nuclear, Security, and Legal Issues, who 
underscored that he appreciated the USG's effort to brief the 
GOM on this matter.  While this issue does not impact 
directly Mexico's national interests, as a country bordering 
the U.S., Mexico finds it useful whenever the United States 
strengthens its own security.  Juarez also appreciated the 
U.S.'s effort to consult with Russia on the shift to the 
Phased Adaptive Approach, particularly given the Russian 
Government's concerns over the USG's previous agreements with 
the Czech Republic and Poland on the single GBI field and the 
single large, fixed European radar.
