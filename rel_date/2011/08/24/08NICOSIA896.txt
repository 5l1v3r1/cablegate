¶1.  (SBU)  At 1100 hrs on November 8, approximately 50 
individuals representing the Syrian diaspora in Cyprus staged 
a demonstration around the corner from Embassy Nicosia (Ref

military operation in eastern Syria.  The demonstration was 
peaceful; at its conclusion, a Syrian community leader passed 
an envelope the Regional Security Officer.  In it was a 
message to the Ambassador from the "Syrian Committee in 
Cyprus," the text of which is reproduced in Para 2. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) "His Excellency the Ambassador of the United States 
of America in Cyprus, The Syrian Community in Cyprus has 
sadly received the news of the American army's aggression on 
the Syrian territories. 
 
This attack has caused the lose of many civilians.  It 
constitutes an inhumane act and against international 
legitimacy and state sovereignty, we strongly reject and 
condemn. 
 
As a Syrian community, we would like to congratulate the new 
American President; Obama for his success and we hope that he 
will remain faithful to the change motto that he announced in 
his campaign, and for the purpose of attaining the true 
justice and peace in our region and the world. 
 
Our respect and consideration, from Syrian Community in 
Cyprus. 
 
Thabet Abbarah, The Secretary of the Syrian Community." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The envelope containg the letter carried a return 
address of the Syrian Arab Friendship club, a popular 
restaurant three blocks from the Embassy which is frequented 
by Mission personnel.  Several protestors were affiliated
