¶1. (SBU) As requested in reftels, Ambassador raised our views 
on Afghanistan's future with Foreign Minister Vashadze on 
February 25.  FM Vashadze said that Georgia was eager to 
support our efforts, and was committed to providing a 150-man 
company by year's end to support the French contingent. 
Vashadze noted that Georgia was ready to consider providing 
additional forces beyond the 150 to support Allied efforts in 
Afghanistan.  Georgia was also prepared to provide 
transportation assistance for NATO supplies to Afghanistan. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On February 24, Pol-Econ Chief conveyed the talking 
points (reftels) and emphasized the importance of allied 
engagement on Afghanistan, as well as provided details on the 
increasing U.S. presence in the theater, to Levan Nizharadze, 
Head of Americas Division, Department of Global Affairs, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   Noting the recently proposed 
Georgian contribution of soldiers to the war in Afghanistan, 
Emboffs expressed the U.S. Government's appreciation for this 
support, as well as interest in obtaining Georgian thoughts 
on the way forward. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Nizharadze promised to pass the information to his 
superiors, including Foreign Minister Vashadze and Deputy 
Minister Giga Bokeria.  When asked if Georgia could assist 
NATO in Afghanistan in non-military ways, he stated that 
while financial contributions would be difficult, perhaps 
other avenues such as medical assistance might be possible. 
He noted that the Georgian government would respond promptly 
in the coming weeks with additional details.
