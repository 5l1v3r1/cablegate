1.(U) Summary: A Mission interagency panel evaluated one 
proposal for the Trafficking in Persons solicitation for G/TIP 
managed by 2008 ESF and INCLE funds.  We are pleased to submit a 
proposal for Phase III of the International Organization for 
Migration (IOM) / Alola Foundation project entitled: Halt 
Exploitation and Learn to Prosecute (HELP).  This cable contains 
Post's statement of support as well as project details and 
abstract as required by G/TIP per reftel.  Mission is forwarding 
the proposal to G/TIP via e-mail.  Post considers complete 
funding of the three phases of the HELP project to be of urgent 
importance in light of recent developments that have increased 
Timor-Leste's vulnerability to potential traffickers.  We hope 
that quick action can be taken on funding this comprehensive 
approach to strengthen Timor-Leste's nascent anti-trafficking 
capacity and ensure that Timor-Leste does not risk deterioration 
in this area.  End summary.

Abstract: Timor-Leste is a destination country for sex 
trafficking of women from other Asian countries, and recent 
anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that it is also affected by 
internal rural-to-urban and district-to-district sex trafficking 
in Timorese women and girls. Despite acknowledgement and growing 
awareness of the problem among the public, civil society, and 
the Government of Timor-Leste, protection and prosecution 
efforts within the country are inadequate. 
 
 
 
This project will enhance efforts to prosecute traffickers and 
extend legal protections to their victims by providing technical 
assistance for drafting comprehensive counter trafficking 
legislation and coordinating efforts to advocate for its 
enactment. It will protect trafficked persons by increasing the 
quality and quantity of protective and assistance services 
through the establishment of a shelter and the provision of 
direct assistance, and will increase the institutional capacity 
of law enforcement and service providers through targeted 
trainings and the establishment of a broad-based coordination 
forum.
