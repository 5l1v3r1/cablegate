¶1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please handle 
accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission 
(KPK) scored a major victory with the arrest of corruption suspect 
Anggodo Widjojo.  The arrest not only fulfills the public's sense of 
justice, but demonstrates the KPK's commitment to eradicate 
corruption in the midst of attacks meant to weaken the institution. 
END SUMMARY 
 
¶3.  (U) The KPK arrested Widjojo on January 14, charging him with 
attempted bribery, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy to commit 
acts of corruption.  The arrest came after three long interrogation 
sessions conducted by KPK investigators of which the first two were 
unable to produce grounds for Widjojo's arrest.  In November 2009, 
the Indonesian National Police (INP) detained and later released 
Widjojo after a recording played before Indonesia's Constitutional 
Court implicated him in a plot to frame KPK commissioners (see 
reftel B). 
 
¶4. (U) Civil society hailed the arrest as a significant victory for 
the KPK after a series of perceived setbacks.  According to former 
Presidential fact-finding team member Komaruddin Hidayat, this 
arrest fulfills the public's sense of justice. Widjojo played a 
central role in the plot to implicate KPK commissioners Chandra M. 
Hamzah and Bibit Samad Riyanto which sparked demonstrations in 
support of the KPK. 
 
¶5. (U) Interim KPK chief Tumpak Hatorang Panggabean suggested that 
there may be additional suspects named in the KPK's continuing 
investigation.  The recording played before the Constitutional Court 
implicated other individuals, including former Deputy Attorney 
General Abdul Hakim Ritonga, Assistant Attorney General for 
Intelligence Wisnu Subroto, and INP Chief Detective Susno Duadji. 
Indonesia Corruption Watch legal affairs expert Febri Diansyah 
suggested that these individuals could also be arrested on similar 
charges based on the recorded conversations. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Some institutions, including the INP, continue to question 
the KPK's integrity.  Most recently, Constitutional Court Chief 
Justice Mafud MD raised in the press rumors that a KPK official 
received approximately USD 2 million from a corruption suspect. 
Widjojo's arrest, however, shows that the KPK is continuing to bring 
alleged corruptors to justice, an action which has broad-based 
public support.
