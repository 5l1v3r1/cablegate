START MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
Alexandre Galdin is a fast-rising expert on defense and 
security matters for the French government who has a bright 
career ahead of him.  He has the ear of UMP politicians and is 
in a position to influence French government representatives 
for years to come.  A trip to the U.S., where he has never 
been before, would provide him expertise to better appreciate 
American policies, to start to build a network of contacts and 
to help him communicate a positive view of the value of 
transatlantic cooperation. 
Given the SGDN's focus on regional conflicts, on counter- 
terrorism and on other security and defense matters, Mr. 
Galdin would be able to draw on his experience in the I.V. 
Leadership program.  This type of investment is sure to have a 
positive influence on the Post's long-term MPP Goals. 
END MEMO NOM-POST-OBJ: 
START MEMO NOM-POST-RCMD: 
Post recommends that we send him as an individual grantee on a 
project dealing with Foreign Affairs and Security issues. 
Post also suggests that Galdin meets with political 
consultants and gains a better understanding of the domestic 
American policy-making process.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: Caroline Gorse-Combalat 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
In the General Secretariat for National Defense (SGDN: inter- 
ministerial agency attached to the Prime Minister's Office), 
Alexandre Galdin works in close contact with the Secretary 
General of National Defense who advises the Prime Minister on 
defense, security, foreign affairs, domestic, economic and 
financial issues.  The SGDN role is to help out the General 
Secretary of the Government coordinate its tasks, prepare 
 
SIPDIS 
Cabinet meetings and draw up reports. 
As advisor in charge of the inter-ministerial coordination of 
defense and security matters, Galdin has demonstrated his 
capacity to be an influential actor in the field of defense 
and foreign affairs issues. 
In the UMP, Alexandre Galdin has already held strong positions 
as Assistant to the presidential campaign of Edouard Balladur 
in 1995, as member of the board of the French section of the 
Atlantic Association for Young Political Leaders from 1996 
until 2002, as member of the RPR departmental committee of 
Paris in 1998 and now as Vice-President (UMP) of the Financial 
and Open Markets Commission of the Paris Government.  Again, 
in these instances, Alexandre Galdin has developed his 
influence and expects to play a growing role in the future.
