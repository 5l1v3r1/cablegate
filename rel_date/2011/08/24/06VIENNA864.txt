AGAINST AUSTRIAN COMPANIES 
 
REF: STATE 40595 
 
Â¶1.  Stefan Benner from the Ministry of Justice's Department 
for Criminal Matters told us March 21 that the Viennese 
Public Prosecutor's Office had initiated pre-trial 
investigations against Austrian companies, which Independent 
Inquiry Committee (IIC) reports mentioned as possible 
suspects of fraud and corruption in the Oil-for-Food 
Program.  Benner said the IIC reports do not provide much 
information beyond the names of the companies.  To obtain 
additional information, a prosecutor is traveling to UN 
headquarters in New York on March 22 to examine the 
respective files.
