SUBJECT: INDONESIAN REACTION TO THE SECRETARY'S SPEECH ON 
ASIA-PACIFIC MULTILATERALISM 
 
REF: A. STATE 3946 
     ¶B. STATE 2965 
 
¶1.  (SBU) As requested reftels, poloff delivered points on 
Asia-Pacific multilateralism and Secretary Clinton's January 
12 speech at a January 15 meeting with Arto Suryodipuro, 
Deputy Director for APEC of the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DEPLU) Directorate of Intra-Regional Cooperation in Asia 
Pacific and Africa, and Siti Sofia Sudarma of DEPLU's 
Directorate General of ASEAN Cooperation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In response, Suryodipuro said the GOI appreciated 
the message of the Secretary's speech, particularly the 
reaffirmation of American commitment to a strong role in 
Asia.  DEPLU and FM Natalegawa encouraged and would continue 
to support a deeper role for the United States in regional 
institutions.  Looking to the possibility of new regional 
institutions or groupings, Suryodipuro noted that the GOI 
wished to maintain the centrality of ASEAN (and ASEAN-related 
groupings such as the ARF and ASEAN 3).   The issue of 
sequencing would also be key to ensure that any new summit- 
or ministerial-level gatherings would be timed so that the 
desired participants could actually attend.  On a related 
subject, the GOI was in the process of formulating its views 
on the potential for APEC expansion as the end of the 
moratorium on new members approache, and hoped to discuss the 
issue with the USG in the near future. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Sudarma said ASEAN was still in the process of 
building a regional community, and it was important that new 
institutions not have a negative impact on that process. 
Additionally, the structure of any new regional institutions 
should follow functional needs and serve a specific purpose. 
The GOI had not yet taken a stance on Australia's 
Asia-Pacific Community proposal or Japan's East Asia 
Community concept and looked forward to a continued exchange 
of opinions with the United States and other counterparts. 
The Secretary's speech provided a good basis for those 
discussions. 
 
¶4.  (U) To date, the Indonesian media and civil society have 
not yet taken up the Secretary's speech.  We expect reaction 
will be forthcoming as the Indonesian public has a chance to 
digest the content of the speech and will continue to monitor 
and report on response.  Jakarta PAS has distributed the full 
text to some 20 media contacts.
