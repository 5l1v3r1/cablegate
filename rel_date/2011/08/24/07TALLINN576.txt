MINISTER OF EDUCATION 
 
REF:  TALLINN 488 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On August 16, Ambassador Phillips paid a courtesy 
call on Minister of Education and Research Tonis Lukas. 
Minister Lukas emphasized that the GOE's program to 
introduce Estonian-language classes in Russian-language 
high schools is a step-by-step "transition," not a 
"reform."  He reported that all 63 Russian-language schools 
are ready to start teaching Estonian literature in Estonian 
-- per the plan -- on September 3, the first day of school. 
(Reftel)  Despite "outside efforts" to derail the process, 
Minister Lucas said the Ministry does not expect any 
problems, and certainly not Riga-style protests.  (Note. 
In 2004, hundreds of ethnic Russians took to the streets in 
protest when the Government of Latvia implemented a 
similar, albeit more rapid-paced, school language program. 
End Note.)  In an effort to avoid the problems faced in 
Riga, Lukas said, the GOE consulted the Latvian government 
about their experience.  Minister Lucas commented that a 
number of Russia-based committees in Brussels are 
attempting to portray Estonia's school language program as 
discriminatory and a violation of human rights. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Minister Lukas indicated other priorities for the 
Ministry include teaching Estonian to very young children 
and promoting vocational education.  Currently, 3,500 
elementary-age Russian-speaking children are enrolled in 
voluntary Estonian language immersion programs.  In 
addition, teaching Estonian is obligatory in all Russian- 
language schools from kindergarten forward.  Minister Lucas 
noted that fewer and fewer young people are interested in 
pursuing vocational education.  As a result of Estonia's 
declining population (and a "baby bust" in the late 
1990's), vocational school enrollment is low and the number 
of both Russian and Estonian-language high schools 
necessary to educate Estonia's population is decreasing. 
However, Minister Lucas emphasized, Russian-language 
schools will exist in Estonia as long as there is a need 
for them. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment.  Lukas' predecessor, Mailis Reps, was a 
member of the Center Party -- which is the most popular 
political party among Russian Estonians.  Lukas, however, 
is a long-time member of the Isamaa and Respublic Union 
Party (IRL), traditionally the least favorite among Russian 
speakers.  Despite the change in leadership, the Ministry's 
long-standing language integration plans remain relatively 
uncontroversial.  End Comment.
