SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
U.S. Special Envoy Sen. George Mitchell to Israel, West Bank, June 
8-10, 2009 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Maariv headlined that U.S. Special Envoy for Middle East Peace Sen. 
George Mitchell Qis trying to lower the flames.Q  The Jerusalem Post 
reported that, during a day of meetings that included four hours 
with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Mitchell was told that 
Israel would not bring all settlement construction to a complete 
halt, even though this continues to be the United StatesQ stated 
position.   The Jerusalem Post quoted one senior official as saying 
that there appeared to be some "convergence" between the sides, and 
they were moving toward a definition of the issues.    Following the 
evening meeting with Mitchell, which included a two-hour one-on-one 
conversation, Netanyahu's office issued a statement that the meeting 
was "friendly and positive and encompassed the whole range of issues 
on the agenda."   Netanyahu, according to the statement, said that 
"Israel is working to promote peace and security with our 
Palestinian neighbors and the wider Arab world."   The media 
reported that Mitchell stressed the importance of the U.S.-Israeli 
relationship, and Washington's commitment to Israel's security. 
(The Jerusalem Post noted that those remarks were made Qin front of 
the cameras.Q)  Israel Radio quoted Abbas as saying in interviews 
with Egyptian media that he will not resume negotiations with Israel 
if the latter does not freeze settlements and adopt the two-sate 
solution.  The media cited a State Department announcement that 
Mitchell will hold meetings in Lebanon and Syria after he leaves 
Israel. 
 
MaarivQs Ben Caspit rejects Sen. MitchellQs denial of reports that 
he accused Israel of having lied to the U.S.  Maariv further 
reported that similar remarks were made by U.S. officials in talks 
with Israeli officials in London, and Qin even stronger termsQ by 
other U.S. officials.  (Channel 10-TV cited an argument in London 
where Israeli officials allegedly told their American counterparts 
that their demands were not fair, prompting their interlocutors to 
ask: QAre you saying that the President is not fair?Q)  Caspit cited 
an unattributed cable Qthat reached decision-makers in Jerusalem and 
reported that the Jewish leader to whom Mitchell made the comments 
Qhad no coiceQ but to deny them. 
 
Yediot and other media reported that President Obama has recently 
outlined a plan that would result in the establishment of a 
Palestinian state. The newspaper detailed reported stages of the 
plan -- in the immediate period: Israeli agreement to freeze 
settlements and to the two-state principle, and gestures by the Arab 
states; in the coming months: the convening of an international 
conference (according to Maariv, a QMadrid-styleQ conference) 
including the Arab states and Israel; by the end of 2010: conclusion 
of negotiations on the core issues and the character of the 
Palestinian state; during 2012: official proclamation of the 
Palestinian state alongside Israel.  Israel TV and Yediot reported 
on behind-the-scenes contacts involving Israel, the U.S., France, 
Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf states, and the EU, to 
promote the conference. 
 
Defense Minister Ehud Barak was quoted as saying in an interview 
with HaQaretz that Benjamin NetanyahuQs government will surprise 
people yet.  In an unrelated story, The Jerusalem Post reported that 
yesterday, Barak told aspiring IDF officers following an extensive 
military drill held in southern Israel --which Maariv says was a 
simulation of an attack on a Syrian village -- that the armyQs 
future campaigns will be Qwider in scopeQ and present more dangers 
than JanuaryQs Operation Cast Lead in Gaza. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday, during an address at the 
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Strategic Affairs 
Minister Moshe Ya'alon (Likud) delivered a blistering attack on the 
Obama administration's Middle East policies, suggesting that its 
approach toward Iran and the PA were flawed.  "Just like the new 
administration, we too believe that friends should be candid with 
each other," he was quoted as saying.  "It is our duty to explain to 
our American friends our concerns."   He was referring to comments 
that President Obama and other officials have made recently about 
the need to be clear with Israel that certain policies, such as 
settlement expansion, aren't acceptable.  Maariv and Israel Radio 
noted that in his address, YaQalon mentioned the Qtwo-stateQ notion, 
saying however that it is too early to consider it. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted right-leaning Kadima Knesset Member Otniel 
Schneller as saying this week that acceding to ObamaQs demands to 
freeze building in all settlements would lead to the break-up of the 
party. 
 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday Israel began construction 
of an underground pipeline that will deliver diesel fuel and cooking 
oil to the southern Gaza Strip, a decision that the IDF said follows 
GOI suggestion. 
Yediot quoted DM Barak as saying at a convention of the Israeli 
Council for Peace and Security that weapons that U.S. supplied to 
Lebanon might end up in HizbullahQs hands.  Israel Radio reported 
that pro-Western Lebanese politician Saad Hariri ruled out bilateral 
negotiations with Israel. 
Channel 2-TV reported on IAF pilotsQ training to dodge missiles 
such as the Russian-made S-300s -- that Iran might use during an 
attack on the country.  Maariv led with a report on IranQs upcoming 
elections by The Washington PostQs Thomas Erdbrink.

Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
Â¶I. QA Threefold Failure, and an Opportunity 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (6/10): QThree weeks after Benjamin Netanyahu 
returned from his visit to Barack Obama, there is no longer any 
doubt that the prime minister has failed in his most important 
mission -- to build a bond of trust with the U.S. President.... His 
second failure is his positions.... On Sunday, the Prime Minister 
will deliver an address at Bar-Ilan University. He is widely 
expected to use this speech to move closer to adopting the two-state 
solution and accepting the road map, which leads to a Palestinian 
state alongside Israel.  If so, he will surely explain this dramatic 
turnabout by saying that his predecessors, who accepted the Roadmap, 
left him with an impossible legacy. Netanyahu's third failure is 
his loss of control over the agenda.  Before departing for his White 
House meeting, Netanyahu promised to make the Iranian threat a key 
issue.  But Obama and his aides managed to divert attention toward 
construction in the settlements - an issue on which Israel has no 
supporters.... Netanyahu's speech on Sunday will give him a second 
chance to try to rehabilitate his ties with Obama, adjust his 
government's positions to Washington's demands, and divert the 
agenda from the silly debate over Qnatural growthQ to matters far 
more crucial to Israel.  He may never get a third chance. 
 
II. QThe Regional Approach Might Get Us There Faster 
 
Kadima Knesset Member Avi Dichter, a former Internal Security 
Minister and head of the Shin Bet, wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post (6/10): QIf we are determined never to 
leave any stone unturned in our search for peace with our neighbors, 
now is the time to see whether underneath the Arab initiative's 
proposed regional approach lies such an opportunity. While the size 
and weight of the boulders are great, so is the opportunity to make 
great strides forward.  Perhaps we can reach an accommodation with 
our nearest neighbors by arriving first at one with those furthest 
away.  As James Joyce wrote, QSometimes the longest road around is 
the shortest road home. 
 
III. QThe Old Game Is Up 
 
Liberal columnist Gideon Samet, a former consul in Philadelphia, 
wrote in the popular, pluralist Maariv (6/10): QWe have a Prime 
Minister who failed his exams.  During his speech at Bar-Ilan 
University, he will have an opportunity to make up for this. 
Benjamin Netanyahu is known for his late awakenings.  Not that he 
lacks talent.  His problem -- and ours -- is his short-range vision. 
 The man has remained blind to a totally new landscape.... Churchill 
earned his place [in history] thanks to his fortitude facing a poor 
British leadership.  Netanyahu is far from reaching such heights. 
But he must now do the best he can, even if this means his political 
demise.  His duty to us is to understand that Qthe game is upQ [in 
English].  History will move forward without the knights of Greater 
Israel -- with or without Bibi.
