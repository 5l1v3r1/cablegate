counter-terrorism (CT) meeting September 13 with Australian 
and Japanese counterparts.  Discussion focused mainly on 
current and future CT initiatives with the Indonesian 
government.  The session ended with agreement on the need to 
continue to encourage:  1) GOI interagency coordination; and 
2) designation of a lead agency for GOI CT-related responses. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) CT TRILAT:  Mission hosted a trilateral 
counter-terrorism meeting September 13 with Australian and 
Japanese counterparts.  The meeting was chaired by Pol/C with 
Mission also represented by RSO, DAO, ODC and DOJ.  The SE 
Asia RSI Coordinator based in Kuala Lumpur also participated 
in the meeting, offering regional perspectives.  The 
Australian delegation included representatives from the 
military, police, customs and immigration ministries.  A 
Japanese diplomat sat in for his side. 
 
¶4. (SBU) MEETING FOCUS:  Pol/C opened the meeting by 
emphasizing the importance of the trilateral meetings.  The 
discussions provided the key information needed by 
governments on better ways to coordinate assistance.  The 
information would be used at upcoming high-level meetings. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Discussion focused on: 
 
-- current and future CT initiatives with the GOI 
-- security assistance in the tri-border "Sulu/Sulawesi Seas" 
region, and, 
-- training with Indonesian police and military on hostage 
rescue and counter-hijacking scenarios. 
 
¶6. (SBU) HOSTAGE RESCUE/COUNTER-HIJACKING:  Hostage rescue 
and counter-hijacking, an area which has received less 
attention during previous trilateral discussions, was treated 
extensively.  The Japanese reported having completed a 
training session with airport security forces and police 
Special Detachment 88 (SD-88) at the Jakarta International 
Airport on September 7.  There was consensus that these were 
potential areas for further cooperation in the future. 
 
¶7. (SBU) NEXT STEPS:  The session ended with agreement on the 
need to encourage 1) GOI interagency coordination and 2) 
designation of a lead agency for GOI CT-related responses. 
Embassies also agreed to create a matrix summarizing the 
three embassies' CT-related assistance programs in order to 
facilitate closer coordination among embassies in the 
collective assistance effort.  The matrix will list relevant 
CT-related programs by country and target.  The group agreed 
to merge the matrix into a single document and review it at 
the next tri-lateral meeting scheduled for November.
