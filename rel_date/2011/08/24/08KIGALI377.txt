SUBJECT: PROPOSALS FOR FY 2008 AMBASSADORS' FUND FOR 
REFUGEES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 06779 
 
Â¶1. (U) Embassy Kigali submits the following two proposals for 
consideration for funding by the FY 2008 Ambassadors' Fund 
for Refugees.  Note: Post will submit more detailed 
information on each project to PRM via unclass e-mail. 
 
Project: Concrete Drainage System and Spring Capping 
Description: The American Refugee Committee (ARC) is 
requesting $20,000 to conduct two projects.  For the first, 
ARC seeks funds to construct a concrete drainage system in 
Nyabiheke refugee camp to resolve health and safety problems 
with standing water and to ease relations with nearby farmers 
who must deal with unsatisfactory drainage and overflows from 
the current hand-dug drainage system.  ARC also requests 
funds to cap two springs to feed an existing water 
gravitation system in Kiziba refugee camp, making potable 
water available to the entire camp. 
 
Project: Family-size Kitchens with Fuel-efficient Cooking 
Stoves and Solar Oven Bread-baking Initiative 
Description:  The World Food Program (WFP) and ARC jointly 
request $20,000 to construct fuel-efficient cooking stoves 
for 800 families in Nyabiheke, Kiziba, and Gihembe refugee 
camps, reducing the amount of firewood needed for cooking and 
thereby reducing environmental degradation and the need to 
sell food rations for firewood.  WFP and ARC also request 
support to carry out a solar bread-baking oven project in 
each of the three camps, establishing income-generating 
projects to build the ovens and to use them to bake bread 
that would supply the camps. 
 
Justification: ARC received money from the FY 2007 
Ambassador's Fund for Refugees for a joint project with UNHCR 
and the Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) to provide 
construction materials for houses for returnees from 
Tanzania.  ARC fulfilled its obligations on that project, 
though completion of the homes has been delayed due to 
problems on the part of MINALOC (septel to follow).  However, 
Post believes ARC will successfully carry out either of these 
two projects should it receive FY 2008 funds.  They have the 
expertise and capacity to implement their proposals and, 
unlike in last year's project, they would have responsibility 
for the completion of the entire project, not just the 
purchase and transfer of materials.  Both of the proposals 
meet needs of refugee camps in Rwanda that are not currently 
being funded and would have positive effects on large numbers 
of people, both refugees and the surrounding local 
populations.
