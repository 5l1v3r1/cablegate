SUBJECT: AUSTRIA OPPOSES AN ARTICLE 16 DEFERRAL WITHOUT 
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SITUATION IN SUDAN 
 
REF: A. STATE 12900 B. USUN 141 
 
¶1. Poloff conveyed the information in ref A to Georg Diwald, 
MFA Deputy Director of the Department for International 
Organisations.  Diwald told Poloff that, in consideration of 
Austria's commitment to the rule of law and against impunity, 
Austria would respect the independence of the International 
Criminal Court and treat any Article 16 deferral request 
"with reserve."  Although Austria would listen respectfully 
to such a request, Austria would only consider a deferral if 
the GOS had made positive contributions towards alleviating 
the humanitarian in Sudan and the Darfur region, with the 
ultimate goal of achieving peace and justice.  On this issue 
Austria felt Sudan still had "a long way to go." 
 
¶2. In response to a query by Poloff, Diwald said Austria had 
made its opinion on an Article 16 deferral clear during the 
debate in the UNSC with representatives from the Arab League 
and the AU (ref B), and in a bi-lateral meeting of these 
representatives with PermRep Thomas Mayr-Harting.  Diwald 
also added that Mayr-Harting, serving in his capacity as 
Chairman of the UNSC sanctions committee on Sudan, is in 
close contact with the Sudan PermRep, particularly given the 
problem in obtaining a visa for one sanctions committee 
member.  In these meetings, Mayr-Harting has been "quite 
clear" in making Austria's position known to his Sudan 
counterpart.
