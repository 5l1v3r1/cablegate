¶1.  SUMMARY:  (SBU) Turkey and Iraq held their second bilateral 
water dialogue in 2006 in Ankara on December 14.  Like the earlier 
May 24 meeting, delegations repeated long-held positions and 
quibbled over the agenda and language.  The two sides agreed to meet 
again, and the Iraqis again proposed Baghdad for the venue.  The 
Iraqi delegation included a representative of the KRG (Erbil DG 
Water and Irrigation).  The GOT MFA remains suspicious of the long 
proposed Turkey-Iraq Voluntary Visit program, questioning U.S. 
impartiality.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Second Bilateral Water Dialogue in 2006 - Ilisu Dam 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Characterizing the meeting, GOT MFA water director Esen 
Altug stressed the cooperative atmosphere and technical data 
exchange, observing that the DSI (State Water Administration) 
Director General received the Iraqi delegation.  She noted that the 
Iraqis initially proposed an agenda that was accusatory, rather than 
facilitative, particularly claiming that the Turks had not provided 
information on Ilisu Dam.  The meeting went ahead with a toned down 
agenda.  Altug claimed that the GOT provided additional information 
on the Ilisu Dam, supplementing the three slides presented in May, 
including the web site with links to the Environmental Impact 
Assessment Report and other reports.  She reiterated Turkey's 
determination to move forward on the Ilisu Dam, with or without 
European export credit agency financing (still reportedly under due 
diligence on meeting EU standards).  She noted that, like in May, 
the Iraqis asked no questions about Ilisu.  Altug stressed that 
Turkey aimed to provide information, but this did not constitute or 
necessitate "consultation" (implying Iraqi approval). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Altug noted the Iraqi oft-repeated request that the Turks 
maintain the extra 200 cubic meters per second water flow in the 
Euphrates.  The Turks argued that this is not an obligation that 
they can guarantee.  While noting current acute need for 
hydroelectric electricity and therefore the requirement to push 
ample water flow, Turkey could not predict future electricity needs 
and/or rainfall/snow-pack.  Altug reiterated that Ilisu would be 
used primarily for hydroelectric operation, and only little for 
irrigation (using more efficient sprinkle method, rather than the 
canal system primarily used on the Euphrates). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The two sides agreed to step up data exchange and 
technical cooperation, including training of Iraqi engineers at DSI. 
 Altug said the Iraqis requested data exchange every ten days.  The 
Turks said this was impossible and impractical and endeavored to 
propose a more reasonable period like six months.  The two sides set 
up emergency direct communication mechanisms, but Altug admitted 
that there had been no contact during late autumn flooding.  The 
Iraqi side proposed that the next meeting be in Iraq.  The Turks 
were noncommittal and timing was not determined.  Altug complained 
again that the Iraqi written presentation was in Arabic.  The Iraqi 
Embassy promised to provide a translation.

USG VOLVIS Study Visit 
---------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The MFA energy-water office has been supportive of our 
proposal for a Turkey-Iraq officials study visit (transportation 
funded by OES) to facilitate dialogue and offer U.S. experiences for 
water management and trans-boundary issues (Ref C).  Both Altug and 
DDG Mithat Rende told us that there was some "political" resistance 
in MFA questioning wheher this proposal would be in Turkey's 
interes and questioning USG impartiality on this subject given the 
advisory role the U.S. plays in Iraq.  Altug said that numerous 
senior transitions in the MFA were slowing approval for the 
proposal, but she was confident that approval would be garnered in 
January. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT: Albeit formulaic and repeating long held 
positions, the establishment of regular bilateral dialogue is a huge 
leap forward.  The two sides managed to set a date and pull it off 
with Embassies Ankara and Baghdad only providing confirmation of 
communication.  The presence of a KRG rep is noteworthy and 
reflective of the regional reality of water issues.  Trans-boundary 
water remains a highly sensitive issue for Turkey, and MFA remains 
cautious on our VOLVIS proposal, albeit fully funded by the USG.
