SUBJECT:  SPANTA ON TALIBAN TALKS 
 
¶1. On October 9, FM Spanta convened the diplomatic corps, ostensibly 
to discuss the upcoming ECO conference to be held in Herat, but in 
reality to announce the government's position on talks with the 
Taliban. 
 
Spanta said that the government intended to invite contacts with 
elements of the Taliban who were willing to recognize the authority 
of the government and return to peaceful life.  He made clear that 
there were some members of the Taliban with whom the government 
would not engage, nor would it engage with Al-Qaeda.  Spanta 
repeated President Karzai's distinction between "hard core" Taliban 
and others.  He stressed that the government would not negotiate or 
compromise with terrorism.  He said that the engagement "was not to 
be seen as a sign of weakness, on the part of the government or its 
international partners. 
 
¶2. Comment.  This formal announcement to the diplomatic corps was 
the next step in a larger effort by the government to respond to 
selected Taliban overtures and take acceptable Taliban elements off 
the battlefield.
