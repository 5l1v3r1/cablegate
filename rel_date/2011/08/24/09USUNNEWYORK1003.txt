SUBJECT: U.S. RE-ELECTED TO UN'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL 
 
 ¶1. The United Nations General Assembly held elections on 
October 16 to fill 18 vacancies on the UN's Economic and 
Social Council for the three-year term beginning January 1, 
¶2010. All candidates have been endorsed previously by their 
respective regional groups and were uncontested.  Elected 
were Argentina, Bahamas,Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Chile, 
Comoros, Egypt, Ghana, Iraq, Italy, Mongolia, Philippines, 
Rwanda, Slovakia, Ukraine, the United States, and Zambia. The 
WEOG countries elected for the one-year terms were Finland, 
Malta, Turkey, and Australia.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶3.  VOTE COUNT FOR ELECTION TO FILL FOUR VACANCIES DUE TO 
RELINQUISHED TERMS: Four WEOG countries ended their terms 
early in order to allow others to serve one-year terms in the 
ECOSOC: Australia (vice New Zeland), Finland (vice Sweden), 
Malta (vice Portugal), Turkey (vice Greece). 186 valid 
ballots were cast with four abstentions: Finland received 148 
votes; Malta 147, Turkey 147, Australia 146, Italy 29, the 
United States 29, Canada 29, Belgium 28, Austria 1, Monaco 1, 
and Luxembourg 1. (COMMENT: This election was held prior to 
the election for the 18 seats. The vote take for countries 
other than the four uncontested candidates reflects that some 
delegates - apparently under the impression that they were 
voting for the WEOG portion of the 18 country election that 
followed - selected Italy, the United States, Canada, and 
Belgium in this first election. END COMMENT) 
 
¶2.  VOTE COUNT FOR ELECTION TO FILL 18 VACANCIES: For the 
African group, 188 were cast with 0 abstentions: Ghana 
received 183 votes, Comoros 182, Zambia 180, Rwanda 178, and 
Egypt 177. For the Asian group, 188 valid ballots were cast 
with 0 abstentions: Bangladesh, Mongolia, and the Philippines 
each received 185 votes, and Iraq 182. In the Eastern 
European group: 188 valid ballots were cast with 0 
abstentions: Ukraine received 182 votes and Slovakia 181. In 
the Latin American and Caribbean group, 188 valid ballots 
were cast with three abstentions: Chile received 183 votes, 
Bahamas 182, Argentina 181, and the Dominican Republic 
received one vote. In the Western European and Other States
