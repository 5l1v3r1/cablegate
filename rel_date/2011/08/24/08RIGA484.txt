SUBJECT: LATVIAN SOLDIER KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1. The Ministry of Defense announced that one Latvian soldier had 
been killed, and three wounded, in Afghanistan on August 11.  The 
four servicemen's vehicle was hit by a mine or improvised explosive 
in the town of Meimen while escorting journalists.  13 civilians 
were also reported injured in the blast. 
 
¶2. The battlefield casualty is Latvia's first related to coalition 
efforts in Afghanistan, and the first combat death for Latvian 
forces since December 2006, when two soldiers were killed in Iraq. 
Both President Zatlers and PM Godmanis expressed their condolences 
to the family of the fallen soldier. 
 
¶3. Ambassador Larson called Speaker of the Saeima (Parliament) 
Daudze, in his role as Acting President, to offer condolences. 
Daudze said that while the loss is tragic, the GOL realizes that 
their armed forces are in a combat zone and the government remains 
committed to the mission in Afghanistan.
