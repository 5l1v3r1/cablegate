REF: CARVER-LORENZ EMAIL OCT 9 2009 
 
Post received a letter October 9 from Strasbourg Mayor (and 
national senator) Roland Ries to President Obama regarding the 
Nobel Peace Prize.  Post will pouch original to EUR/WE; informal 
consulate translation follows: 
 
 
 
Strasbourg, October 9, 2009 
 
 
 
Mr. President, 
 
 
 
I have just learned with great pleasure that the Nobel Peace 
Prize has been awarded to you today. 
 
 
 
Obviously, the whole population of Strasbourg remembers very 
well your remarks in our city April 3 during your town hall 
meeting with young French and German students. You mentioned the 
challenges of peace and insisted on the necessary commitment of 
everyone to achieve peace all over the world. 
 
 
 
Your Strasbourg speech is a real benchmark. It is often 
mentioned during international meetings held since then in 
Strasbourg. In a personal capacity, and as Mayor of Strasbourg, 
I often have the opportunity to quote you, as for example when I 
greeted President Michael (sic) Gorbachev in our City Hall last 
week. 
 
 
 
I am confident that this Nobel Peace Prize will give you even 
more strength to contribute to addressing  important 
international issues in a positive way, from the Middle East to 
Afghanistan, from the Persian Gulf region to the furthermost 
borders of Asia. 
 
 
 
Strasbourg is always available for any meeting you might 
consider useful, and I take this opportunity to renew the 
permanent invitation I extended to you when you were here last 
April. 
 
 
 
With my highest consideration and warmest greetings, 
 
 
 
Yours, (handwritten) 
 
/ s / 
 
Roland Ries 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mr. Barack OBAMA 
 
President of the United States
