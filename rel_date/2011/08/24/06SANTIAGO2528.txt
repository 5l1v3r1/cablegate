SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - CHAVEZ AND LATIN AMERICA 
 
On December 5, conservative, afternoon "La Segunda" (circ. 33,000, 
12/5) carried an editorial entitled, "Chavez And His Allies." 
Quote: 
 
"There have been numerous presidential elections this year in the 
region, but the one that could have the biggest political 
repercussion is Hugo Chavez'....  The Venezuelan President is 
characterized by his interventionism in countries...and appears to 
be Fidel Castro's natural heir, with the advantage of his resources 
to promote projects that will mark his presence beyond his own 
country....  Chavez continues to extend his influence and seems to 
have Lula da Silva's support...and Evo Morales' friendship....  Alan 
Garcia won in Peru, and Felipe Calderon succeeded in strengthening 
the Mexican government...but his tight victory and the tenacity of 
the defeated candidate have given him problems since his swearing-in 
ceremony.... Therefore, the region's situation is still 
contradictory with the predominance of radical trends, with the 
foreseeable political tension and economic stalling, all of which 
will have an effect on our country, either directly or indirectly."
