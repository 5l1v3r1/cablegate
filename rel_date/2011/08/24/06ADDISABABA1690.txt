Communique of the 55th Peace and Security Council 
 
Council, 
 
¶1.  Expresses grave concern at the prevailing situation in 
Somalia and its implications for the peace and reconciliation 
process in that country as well as for the security and 
stability of the region as a whole.  In this respect, Council 
reiterates its strong condemnation of the fight in and around 
Mogadishu, as well as the events in Jowhar and elsewhere in 
the country, which resulted in the loss of life and further 
suffering for the civilian population; 
 
¶2.  Strongly appeals to all concerned within Somalia to 
refrain from any action likely to aggravate the situation, to 
seek the path of dialogue and to extend the necessary 
cooperation to the Transitional Federal Government (TFG), as 
the legitimate authority in Somalia, in order to achieve 
lasting peace and reconciliation in the country; 
 
¶3.  Fully supports the initiatives taken by IGAD, including 
the communique issued by the Extraordinary Session of the 
IGAD Council of Ministers, held in Nairobi in 13 June 2006, 
as well as the central role of IGAD in the efforts aimed at 
sustaining the peace and reconciliation process in Somalia; 
 
¶4.  Urges the international community to extend all the 
necessary assistance to the Transitional Federal Institutions 
(TFIs) to enable them to fully assume their responsibilities, 
with a view to restoring lasting peace, reconciliation and 
stabilty in Somalia.  In this respect, Council welcomes the 
commitment of the International Somalia Contact Group to work 
with the UN, the AU and the IGAD to support the 
implementation of the Transitional Federal Charter and 
Institutions, as expressed in the communique issued following 
the meeting held in New York on 15 June 2006; 
 
¶5.  Requests the Commission, working closely with the IGAD, 
to take all necessary steps for the early deployment of a 
Peace Support Mission in Somalia, as provided for in decision 
PSC/PR/Comm (XXIX) adopted at its 29th meeting held on 12 May 
¶2005.  In this regard, Council reiterates its request to the 
Security Council to provide an exemption to the arms embargo 
imposed on Somalia by resolution 733 (1992) of 23 January 
¶1992.  Council welcomes the adoption by the Transitional 
Federal Parliament (TFP), on 14 June 2006, of the National 
Security and Stabilization Plan; 
 
¶6.  Invites AU partners to provide the requisite political, 
financial and logistical support to facilitate the successful 
conclusion of the peace and reconciliation process in 
Somalia, including the deployment of a peace support mission 
in the country.  In this regard, Council looks forward to the 
outcome of the meeting to be convened by the Commission and 
IGAD with all stakeholders to agree on how best to expedite 
the implementation of previous IGAD and AU decisions, in 
order to enhance the prospects for peace, security, stability 
and reconciliation in Somalia.  Council stresses the 
important role of the Coordination and Monitoring Committee 
(CMC) and welcomes the agreement reached on the revised 
mandate and operational procedures of the CMC, as well as the 
initiatives to convene a Donors' Conference; 
 
¶7.  Appeals to the international community to provide the 
required humanitarian assistance to the populations in 
Somalia, and calls on all parties to respect international 
humanitarian law and ensure access to populations in need, as 
well as the protection of humanitarian workers.
