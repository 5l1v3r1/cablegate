Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
After a long and rewarding career with the Foreign Service, I 
will retire from the U.S. government on December 19.  It has 
been a pleasure to work with you to advance our mutual 
interests. 
 
I have greatly appreciated your engagement on regional 
issues, including Tunisia,s support for a two-state solution 
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Tunisia,s active 
participation in the international community, support for 
educational initiatives and women,s rights, and dedication 
to counterterrorism are noteworthy. 
 
It is my sincere hope that you, your family, and the people 
of Tunisia experience health, happiness, and prosperity, now 
and in the years ahead. 
 
Count on me as a friend always. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
David Welch
