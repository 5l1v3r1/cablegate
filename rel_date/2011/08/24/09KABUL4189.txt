Â¶1. With the establishment of the Senior Civilian Representative 
(SCR) in Regional Command-West, effective immediately, the civilians 
in Farah Province will be in the area of responsibility (AOR) of the 
SCR-West.  Farah Province was placed under the direction of the 
SCR-South temporarily prior to the creation of the SCR for Regional 
Command-West.  As envisioned by Kabul 3665, the coordination of 
civilians in Farah by the SCR for RC-West will ensure unity of 
effort between the SCR and military commander of RC-West.
