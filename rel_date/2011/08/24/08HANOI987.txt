REF: STATE 90978 
 
(SBU) On August 25, the DCM met with MFA Director General Nguyen Ba 
Hung to register U.S. concerns about possible Russian recognition of 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and to urge Vietnam to press Russia not 
to take such a step (reftel).  Hung took note of the U.S. position 
and promised to relay the substance of the demarche to his 
superiors.  In a follow-up discussion August 26, Phan Ho The Nam of 
the MFA's Department of International Affairs emphasized that 
Vietnam has encouraged all sides of the conflict to continue 
discussions.  Noting that the Russian government has yet to act on 
the recommendation of the Russian Duma and Federation Council, Nam 
expressed hope that the situation would stabilize with the 
withdrawal of Russian forces.  When pressed, Nam acknowledged the 
importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity as general 
principles, but declined to characterize Vietnam's position on 
Russia's possible recognition of the separatist regions.
