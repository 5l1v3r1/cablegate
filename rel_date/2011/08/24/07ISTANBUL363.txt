This message was coordinated with Embassy Ankara. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Following Sunday's "largest ever" demonstration in 
Turkey (reftel), a union-inspired crowd today took to the 
streets to hold traditional May Day demonstrations. 
Depending on where one started the day, the morning commute 
was either easier than normal or nearly impossible as police 
tried to keep demonstrators from reaching what had been the 
traditional May Day gathering place in Taksim Square where a 
demonstration 30 years ago ended with deaths.  This year, the 
Istanbul Governor's office denied protest permits for Taksim 
Square, consistent with recent practice.  While most union 
leaders agreed to hold the annual rally on the Asian side of 
the city, the leadership of the Confederation of 
Revolutionary Workers' Unions (DISK) opted to defy the ban on 
meeting in Taksim.  By mid-day, police had managed to keep 
all but approximately 1000 demonstrators from reaching the 
square by curtailing subway, bus and ferry service as well as 
using water cannon and tear gas. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) May Day comes on the heels of Istanbul's huge 
demonstration Sunday, April 29, when citizens turned out in 
force in support of Turkey's secular nature (reftel).  In 
contrast to Sunday's peaceful, festive event featuring vastly 
greater numbers of people, today's gatherings in Istanbul 
were marred by violence when demonstrators determined to 
reach a traditional May Day protest point met police just as 
determined to prevent them from gathering in the unauthorized 
location.  Istanbul police typically react strenuously to 
unauthorized demonstrations.  International Women's Day 2005 
was marked by significant violence as police attempted to 
disperse an unauthorized demonstration in Kadikoy. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Embassy Ankara labor contacts representing the two 
largest labor confederations, Turk-Is and Hak-Is, did not 
agree with DISK's decision to press ahead with a 
demonstration in Taksim Square.  Osman Yildiz, Hak-Is' head 
of international relations, said given the high degree of 
tension already prevalent in the countriy tied to the 
presidential election process, DISK's decision was "not 
corrrect."  Yildiz said that according to contacts of his 
within the labor movement, detainees will likely be released 
this evening.  Yildirim Koc, an official with Yol-Is, a union 
affiliated with Turk-Is, similarly criticized DISK's 
"stubbornness" in insisting on marching to Taksim.  However, 
Koc, whose daughter was among the DISK marchers this 
afternoon, said that the security forces acted "intolerantly" 
expecially in comparison to their attitude during the massive 
April 29 rally in Istanbul. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On May 1, 1977, 36 were killed when gunfire from a 
hotel rooftop on Taksim Square triggered a stampede. 
Twenty-nine of the victims died in the stampede and the 
remainder were killed by gunfire.  Reports at the time 
indicate panic grew as police attempted to channel the crowd 
down narrow streets.  It was never determined who opened 
fire.  Police claimed socialist groups were responsible, but 
no one was ever charged with the shooting.
