(U) Pol/Econ chief October 2 passed Ref A and B request for 
delegation details and notional agenda for the October 6-7 
International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza 
Senior Officials Meeting to MFA Director for International 
Organization Affairs Ghassan Shaikho.  Shaikho said he had 
been in touch earlier with the Ministry of Health and the 
Ministry of Municipalities and Agricultural Affairs 
concerning GOB participation at the senior officials meeting. 
 To date, Shaikho had received no word whether officials from 
these ministries would attend the meeting.  Shaikho said that 
if Manama-based officials did not attend, staff from the 
Bahraini Embassy in Washington would do so.  In this case, 
Shaikho said the Bahraini Embassy would be in direct contact 
with NEA concerning the delegation details.
