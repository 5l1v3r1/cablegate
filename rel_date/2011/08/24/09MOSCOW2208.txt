REFTEL: REQUEST #04210023; DATED: 06/23/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Moscow State University 
of Railway Engineering, Moscow, Russia and the foreign purchaser, 
NPP ELIKS JSC, Moscow, Russia.   The University is listed on BIS 
license application D401431 as the ultimate consignee of one AWG5004 
arbitrary waveform generator with options and accessories, 600 MS/S, 
14BIT, 16M point and 4 channels.  NPP ELIKS JSC is the distributor 
in Russia.  This item is controlled for national security and 
anti-terrorism reasons.  The licensee is Tektronix, Inc., 14200 SW 
Karl Braun Drive, Beaverton, OR 97077. 
 
¶3. On August 6, 2009, Commercial Attach Ilona Shtrom and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of Moscow State University of Railway 
Engineering, 9, Obraztsova Street, Moscow, Russia. The export 
control team met with Mr. Yevgeny Scherbina, Head of Laboratory, 
Associate Professor and Mr. Petr Bestemyanov, Director, Department 
of Telecommunication and Electrification. 
 
¶4. Moscow State University of Railway Engineering (MIIT) was founded 
in 1896 and currently has an annual budget of $35-45 million. 
Currently, there are approximately 46,000 students enrolled in its 
various programs across the Russian Federation; 12,000 of these 
students are in Moscow. 
 
¶5. The export control team was able to identify and view the 
Tektronix AWG5004 Arbitrary Waveform Generator in the university 
laboratory.   The Serial number for the equipment was noted as 
B010201; ID 00:00:72: AO:23:39; OI Key: 3XV9E-99TCC-RYZ3R-XCHRM. 
The export control team noted that the lab has a lock with a key. 
The key is available to two students and three university 
professors.  The UniversityQs property is only accessible by a key 
card and closes at 10pm.  When the export control team asked Mr. 
Scherbina about how the Institute surpluses its equipment, we were 
told that there is always use for equipment, no matter how old it 
is, and nothing is ever removed from their inventory. 
 
 
 
¶6. On August 6, 2009, the export control team also met with the 
following representatives of NPP ELIKS JSC:  Alexander Afonskiy, 
President of Eliks Group, Editor-in-Chief of the magazine "Test & 
Measuring Instruments and Systems" Professor of Bauman State 
Technical University and Tatyana Afonskaya, Development Director. 
 
¶7.  ELIKS, a family-owned and operated business, located at 57-5, 
Kashirskoe shosse, Moscow, Russia, was founded in 1992 and is a 
supplier of testing and measuring instruments, soldering equipment 
and industrial furniture in Russia.  In addition to serving as a 
distributor for Tektronix, the company also sells equipment 
manufactured by U.S. companies Fluke and Keithley.  Since 2000, 
ELIKS has manufactured under its own brand name (Aktakom).  The 
company sells to a wide variety of end-users ranging from large 
industrial enterprises, universities, scientific research institutes 
to metrology and telecom organizations.  The export control team 
found the company to be well-prepared for the meeting and 
well-informed on U.S. export controls and their obligations under 
the EAR.  ELIKS indicated they are aware of constraints such as the 
prohibition on re-exporting U.S. items.  Under their internal 
technology control plan, when applicable, they request their 
customers to sign an agreement to abide by these same constraints. 
They also check USG lists such as the denied parties and entities 
list.  Mr. Afonskiy stated that if they are not comfortable with a 
customer, they will not sell to them.  ELIKS even provides its 
customers with information on U.S. export controls on its website:

¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends Moscow State University of 
Railway Engineering, Moscow, Russia, as well as NPP JSC ELIKS as 
reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
