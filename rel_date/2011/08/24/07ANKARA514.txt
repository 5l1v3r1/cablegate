REF: STATE 28280 
 
(SBU) We provided reftel points to MFA Arms Control 
Department Head Serhan Yigit on March 7, explaining our 
efforts to achieve a common NATO position on CFE transfers 
and cross-group stationing in order to respond to likely 
Russian questions.  Yigit undertook to discuss our approach 
with the MFA's NATO office and with senior MFA officials in 
preparation for the March 13 HLTF Deputies discussion.
