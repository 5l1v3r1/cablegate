Visit by North Korean Premier Kim Yong-il 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the regularly scheduled March 17 MFA press briefing, 
spokesperson Qin Gang said that China has "noted the announcement by 
DPRK to test a satellite" and acknowledged that the current 
situation on the Korean Peninsula is "complicated with an increasing 
number of uncertain factors."  China is "concerned," and because 
"peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula is in the interest of 
all parties," the Chinese Government hopes that "relevant parties 
can settle the issues through dialogue and exercise restraint." 
 
¶3.  Qin said North Korean Premier Kim Yong-il arrived in Beijing 
today, March 17, for an official visit.  Kim will meet President Hu 
Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and NPC Chairman Wu Bangguo and will 
attend ceremonies commemorating the 60th anniversary of the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and North Korea. 
 Asked whether the resumption of the Six-Party Talks will be 
discussed with the DPRK premier, Qin replied that "the two sides can 
discuss any issues of common interest," and that China supports the 
Six-Party Talks as a "useful mechanism toward normalizing 
relations."  Scheduling actual dates "depends on when conditions are 
ripe and if all parties are willing," Qin said. 
 
Escape of Gao Zhisheng's Family 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Asked if China was insisting on the return of Gao Zhisheng's 
family, Qin said he had not heard of such any such demands. Qin 
denied that Gao's family had been subjected to persecution by the 
Chinese Government, asserting that Gao "is a criminal sentenced 
because he broke Chinese law." Gao's case was being handled in 
accordance to law, Qin added. 
 
Territorial Claims to Spratly Islands 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. Regarding the deployment of a Chinese fisheries patrol ship to 
the Spratly Islands, Qin said the vessel was on a "routine fisheries 
mission."  "China has indisputable sovereignty over the islands and 
its adjacent waters in the South China Sea," he said. 
 
ICC Arrest Warrant for Sudan's Bashir 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Regarding the ICC-issued arrest warrant for Sudan President Omar 
Hassan al-Bashir, Qin said that China has been involved in dialogue 
in the UN Security Council, noting that some countries in the 
African Union and Arab League hold "different views" on the warrant. 
 The Chinese Government hopes such concerns will be taken into 
consideration by the UN Security Council to avoid negatively 
impacting the peace process in Darfur.

stated.
