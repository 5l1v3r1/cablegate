SUBJECT: OPENING OF TIMIKA TRIAL DEFERRED UNTIL JULY 11 
 
REF: JAKARTA 8114 (TRIAL OF TIMIKA SUSPECTS) 
 
¶1. (SBU) The trial of Anthonious Wamang, Agustinus Anggaibak 
and five other co-conspirators in the 2002 murders of two 
Amcits in Timika, Papua did not begin in Central Jakarta 
District Court on July 4 as originally planned (reftel).  The 
suspects accepted the advice of their legal counsel, a team 
of lawyers from the Indonesian Legal Aid and Human Rights 
Association (PBHI), to decline to appear.  PBHI insists that 
the trial should be held in Timika.  After a morning of 
waiting around the courtroom, the prosecution team prepared a 
letter advising Judge Nurdin of the situation.  The judge 
then deferred the opening of the trial until Tuesday, July 
¶11.  If the defendants persist in refusing to appear at that 
time, the judge, in keeping with established legal practice 
in such situations, is expected to issue a summons for the 
suspects to be compelled to appear at a later date. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The presence of journalists and a group of about 20 
Papuan demonstrators at the courthouse on July 4 indicates 
that when the trial eventually does open, there will be 
significant media interest. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment.  We do not believe that PBHI will succeed 
in reversing the Supreme Court's decision to change the venue 
of the trial from Papua to Jakarta based on security grounds. 
 In Indonesia, there is both ample recent precedent and legal 
basis for such a decision.  This is in effect a stalling 
tactic and a preview of PBHI's likely defense strategy of 
arguing that the prosecution is being driven by political 
considerations on the part of the central government.  End 
comment.
