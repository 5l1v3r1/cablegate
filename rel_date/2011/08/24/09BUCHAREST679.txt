¶1. (SBU) Deputy PolCouns and UK Emboff jointly briefed MFA 
Deputy Director for Asymmetric Risks and Non-Proliferation 
Anca Jurcan on the results of the October 1 P5-1 talks with 
Iran in Geneva.  Jurcan reiterated Romanian support for the 
American and British positions and expressed cautious 
optimism over the results of the talks, stating that the 
agreements in principle were the best possible results under 
the present circumstances. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Jurcan said the Romanians viewed the October 1 
preliminary agreements as a positive beginning but remained 
skeptical of Iran's intent to follow through with these 
latest commitments.  She stressed that the United States 
could count on Romanian support for tough sanctions should 
Iran fail to live up to the agreements, but also noted it was 
a positive sign that Iran had agreed to a follow-up meeting 
October 18 in Vienna
