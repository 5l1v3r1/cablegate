¶1. (SBU) On Oct. 3, the regional UNHCR rep provided Econoff 
with a breakdown of how various Saudi government bodies will 
be involved in UNHCR's efforts to provide aid to internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) in Yemen.  These details were worked 
out at a meeting between UNHCR and Saudi authorities on Oct. 
¶3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The breakdown is as follows: 
 
-- Ministry of Interior (Border Guards):  Will be the focal 
point for UNHCR activities in Khamis Mashayit and the border 
area. 
 
-- Ministry of Foreign Affairs:  Will arrange for visas for 
UNHCR staff, will grant permission for specific UNHCR 
missions, will arrange for warehouse facilities, and will 
arrange for UNHCR personnel's security escort. 
 
-- Ministry of Finance:  Will arrange for customs clearance 
(in coordination with the MFA) for incoming relief supplies. 
 
-- Saudi Red Crescent:  Will function as UNHCR's local 
partner for the actual provision of humanitarian relief in 
Yemen (including providing "facilities and operational 
capabilities"). 
 
-- Ministry of Culture and Information:  Will facilitate 
local and international media coverage. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In addition, the regional rep informed us that two 
UNHCR staff will be placed in the border city of Khamis 
Mashayit to coordinate activites with the Border Guards.  The 
MFA intends to provide the UNHCR with a check for $1 million 
per the Saudis previously announced pledge.
