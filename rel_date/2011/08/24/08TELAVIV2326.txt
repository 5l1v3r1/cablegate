HaQaretz and The Jerusalem Post quoted Secretary of State 
Condoleezza Rice as saying yesterday that she would leave "no stone 
unturned" in order to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal before 
leaving office, but conceded that time is running out.  Speaking to 
a U.S. conference on Palestinian business and investment, Rice said 
she still hoped to reach the Bush administration's goal of a peace 
deal by the end of 2008, which was set at the Annapolis summit 
nearly a year ago. 
 
Major media reported that, a day after Kadima and Labor signed a 
coalition agreement, Shas is hardening its line for its own 
negotiations.  "The Labor-Kadima agreement distances Shas from 
entering the government," a senior Shas official was quoted as 
saying.  The official also said that the senior status accorded 
Barak, and Labor's veto right for agenda issues, were a cynical 
attempt by the party to push through its worldview.  Yediot quoted 
senior Kadima officials as saying that PM-designate Tzipi Livni is 
offering to allocate Shas half-a-billion shekels ($1.8 billion). 
Leading media reported that some Labor Party members, including MK 
Ophir Pines-Paz, had mixed responses regarding the deal that saw few 
of their demands met.  HaQaretz noted that a narrow coalition would 
face a dilemma: It would have to face a strong opposition, including 
Shas, Likud, and Yisrael Beiteinu, or go to elections. 
 
Leading media reported that yesterday IDF soldiers shot dead a 
Palestinian youth who tried to throw a firebomb near the West Bank 
settlement of Beit El.  The media reported that earlier yesterday, 
PA authorities informed Israel that Palestinian police discovered a 
100-meter-long tunnel in central Hebron during the Jewish holiday of 
Sukkoth.  HaQaretz reported that IDF engineers blew up the tunnel. 
The army is still investigating whether it was meant to facilitate a 
terror attack.  On Monday HaQaretz quoted Palestinian sources as 
saying on Sunday that the PA is expected to deploy a battalion of 
security forces to Hebron on Friday. 
 
HaQaretzQs Avi Issacharoff visited the PA-run Nablus jail and found 
that the Fatah inmates have mellowed.  On Monday, Yediot 
correspondents who visited with the Governor of Jenin brought back 
mixed impressions. 
 
HaQaretz reported that yesterday the Syrian government condemned 
Israel over recent Jewish-Arab clashes in Acre, saying the violence 
was an Israeli attempt to drive Arabs out of the mixed city. 
"Israel is trying to frighten the Arabs in efforts to drive them 
out," wrote Tishrin, the official Syrian government newspaper. "This 
is additional proof that Israel hates Arabs and wants to 'purify' 
its territory from all Arab presence.Q  Makor Rishon-Hatzofe 
reported that Hizbullah made a similar announcement.  HaQaretz and 
The Jerusalem Post quoted the FPLP, which assassinated Israeli 
cabinet minister Rehavam Zeevi in 2001, as saying yesterday that it 
plans to kill right-wing MK Avigdor Lieberman.  Lieberman wants to 
transfer Israeli Arab towns to Palestinian jurisdiction and annex 
large Jewish settlements in the West Bank.  He termed the Acre riots 
a pogrom against Jews and the start of an Intifada inside Israel. 
The Jerusalem Post reported that U.S. performers were disappointed 
by the Acre MunicipalityQs decision to cancel the Acre Festival of 
Alternative Israeli Theater in the wake of the riots in the city. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Hamas has launched an Internet site 
called AqsaTube, a file-sharing resource enabling users to upload 
videos.  The newspaper quoted the Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism 
Information Center as saying that, while its format and design are 
similar to the popular YouTube site, the Hamas version is devoted 
entirely to propaganda and incitement.  Makor Rishon-Hatzofe filed a 
similar report on Sunday. 
 
On Sunday, Makor Rishon-Hatzofe reported that Palestinians have 
exploited the permits for picking olives to stage provocations 
against Jewish settlements in the Nablus area. 
 
On Sunday The Jerusalem Post reported that last week the IDF denied 
entry into Gaza to a delegation of Israeli-Arab doctors affiliated 
with Physicians for Human Rights-Israel.  They were supposed to 
perform operations and examinations and consult with patients. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday Israel took a QweQll 
believe it when we see itQ attitude to a decree by Syrian President 
Bashar Assad that Damascus will establish a diplomatic mission in 
Beirut. 
 
Leading media reported that on Sunday liberal novelist David 
Grossman attended the dedication of a Torah scroll that was written 
in memory of his son, Uri Grossman, who fell during the Second 
Lebanon War. David Grossman stated his satisfaction that the 
ceremony could be held at the religious-Zionist Yeshiva of Netiv 
Aryeh in Jerusalem, which does not share his political views. 
 
HaQaretz (Hebrew Ed.) bannered President BushQs plan to partly 
nationalize nine major banks.

Former Mossad director Ephraim Halevy wrote in the conservative,

defining the sacrifice that Israel might be called to accept and 
then negotiate it with Iran in Israel's absence.

"The Major Diplomatic Challenges for the 21st Century" 
 
Former Mossad director Ephraim Halevy wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post (10/12): QIsrael, a major player in the 
Middle East and a junior player on the international scene, must 
ensure that, as of now, it becomes an indispensable partner for any 
future coalition that is created to face down international 
existential threats whatever the method chosen to deal with them. 
One such case in hand is that of Iran, which constantly and loudly 
advocates putting an end to the existence of Israel as a sovereign 
and independent state.  If all other options fail, the military one 
might evolve into the only one left Qon the table.Q  he dangers for 
all parties in such a predicament do not require any further 
explanation.  But should the QdiplomaticQ option take center stage, 
it is more than obvious that the items for negotiation will include 
interests that are most vital to Israel.  Euphemisms like Qregional 
securityQ or Qregional hegemonyQ or guaranteeing Iran's security 
interests are inseparably bound up with the most acute necessities 
of Israel.  Should Iran go for what is enticingly labeled the Qgrand 
bargain,Q it is unthinkable that this can be negotiated without 
Israel sitting at the table.  No ally of Israel, however loyal and 
attentive, and the United States is just that, can act as a proxy in 
defining the sacrifice that Israel might be called to accept and 
then negotiate it with Iran in Israel's absence.  This is the kind 
of challenge that diplomacy will face in the years to come. And Iran 
is but one example -- albeit a very major one -- of the intricate 
portfolios that await us.  This, then, is our major diplomatic 
challenge for the 21st century.

Summary:

The Director of the Interdisciplinary Center's Global Research in 
International Affairs Center, columnist Barry Rubin, wrote in the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post: QWhat's the effective 
voice in the region?  Not the Qpeace processQ concept used in 
talking with the West, but the QresistanceQ concept, used in talking 
among themselves.

¶I.  "Why the Middle East Is Sick" 
 
The Director of the Interdisciplinary Center's Global Research in 
International Affairs Center, columnist Barry Rubin, wrote in the 
conservative, independent Jerusalem Post (10/13): QIn pursuit of its 
vendetta against Israel and the West, the Arab world is committing 
suicide -- not only the individual suicide of the terrorist, but the 
suicide of entire societies.  On a daily basis, this means rejecting 
the reforms those societies need. In the long run, it means risking 
takeover by radical Islamists.  The rest of the world, finding such 
talk incomprehensible, either thinks its meaningless jabber, or 
ignores it altogether.  Surely the problem must stem from 
addressable grievances, fixable misunderstandings and emotional 
exaggeration?  Unfortunately, this is all nonsense.  What's the 
effective voice in the region?  Not the Qpeace processQ concept used 
in talking with the West, but the QresistanceQ concept, used in 
talking among themselves.... How can the United States possibly tame 
a tiger trained and owned by others who both whip and feed it daily? 
 What does it matter if Arab notables speak soothingly at diplomatic 
parties or in Western media interviews while millions at home are 
inundated by a very different message?  Even if the tie-and-suit, 
polished-manners crowd are sincere, they dare not say the same thing 
to their people that they whisper into the ears of gullible 
foreigners. 
 
II.  "Acre Riots" 
 
The Jerusalem Post editorialized (10/12): QWe have no sympathy with 
the band of Jewish youths [from Acre] who resorted to rioting when 
[the Arab driver Tawfik] Jamal made his appearance.  What they 
should have done was to call the police while seeking safety if they 
felt genuinely threatened.  The behavior of the Arabs involved, many 
screaming QItbah al-YahudQ [death to the Jews], disgusts us and is a 
reminder of how dangerously radicalized segments of the community 
have become.  We urge the police to identify the lawbreakers and 
bring them to justice.  Sadly, the usual political arsonists played 
their predictable roles. [Arab] MK Ahmed Tibi termed the Acre events 
a QJewish pogrom,Q while [right-wing] MK Arieh Eldad also played the 
QpogromQ card.  Eldad further fanned the flames: QOne should not be 
surprised if Jews take up arms to defend themselves while the police 
do nothing to protect them.Q Tibi and Eldad, predictably, got it 
wrong -- as did local TV reports and several of the Friday Hebrew 
newspapers.  Using the term QpogromQ in connection with Acre is an 
insult to the memories of the many Jews murdered in state-sponsored 
pogroms such as those organized by the Russian government in the 
1880s.  A correct Zionist response is to insist that Arab and Jewish 
citizens live by the same rules and obligations.  Anyone who 
advocates vigilantism undermines the Jewish state and should be 
shunned.
