SUBJECT: SPAIN SUPPORTS NEW SRSG FOR AFGHANISTAN KAI EIDE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 25020 
 
¶1.  Poloff communicated full U.S. support for Norwegian 
Political Director Kai Eide in his new appointment as the 
Special Representative of the UN Secretary General for 
Afghanistan (reftel).  Spanish MFA's Chief of Continental 
Asia Policy, Pedro Arostegui Llama, reiterated March 14 
Spain's stated support in the months leading up to this 
appointment for a Special Representative who could reinforce 
the coordination of all international actors, both with each 
other and with Afghan authorities, and who would be able to 
count on broad backing from the international community. 
Spain understood that Eide would fulfill its expectations, 
and the United States could count on Spanish support for the 
new SRSG.  Arostegui said it was "very probable" Spanish 
authorities would want to take advantage of the April 2-4 
NATO Summit in Bucharest to transmit GOS support in person 
and to share with the new SRSG Spanish views on the way ahead. 
 
¶2.  The Spanish Foreign Ministry also issued a communique 
March 10 "receiving with satisfaction" Kai Eide's appointment 
and trusting that his personal and diplomatic qualities would 
allow him successfully to address the challenges of his new 
position.  The GOS further pledged its full support and 
collaboration and commended the broad international consensus 
and Afghan government backing that his nomination had already 
elicited.  Spain hoped this appointment would reinforce the 
political leadership of the United Nations, the coordination 
of all international and Afghan actors, and the international 
community's commitment and focus on stability, 
reconstruction, and development in Afghanistan.  The press 
statement concludes, "The Government of Spain maintains its 
firm commitment to an Afghanistan that is secure, stable, 
democratic, and prosperous, free of the threat of terrorism, 
and in peace and close cooperation with its neighbors."
