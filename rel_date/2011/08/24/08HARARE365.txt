Chevron Sees Dark Sky Over Zimbabwe Operation 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Chevron had no plans to divest its downstream 
interests in Southern Africa, Chevron's Country 
Representative Masimba Kambarami told econoff on April 16, 
when asked about the company's divestment plans elsewhere in 
Africa (reftel). Southern Africa was a key market for the 
company and the company intended to continue to invest in the 
southern SADC region, with the exception of Zimbabwe, for 
now. Although Chevron had "an appetite to stay" in Zimbabwe, 
operating conditions were difficult and the company had been 
studying whether to expand aggressively or downsize here 
under a "blue-sky, grey-sky" project since September 2007. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kambarami admitted that since the harmonized 
elections on March 29, the sky had turned "pretty grey" for 
Chevron in Zimbabwe. Fuel sales were down both at the retail 
and industrial level and Chevron was considering winding down 
service to cover only Harare and Bulawayo; selling or 
mothballing many of its fuel depots across the country; and 
laying off half of its directly employed staff of 150. Under 
blue sky or grey, however, Kambarami assured econoff that 
Chevron would be able to continue to supply Embassy Harare 
with fuel in the capital.

BP Puts Expansion Plans on Hold 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) BP Zimbabwe has put on hold plans to expand the sale 
of fuel by coupon to 16 more service stations around the 
country, BP Zimbabwe CEO Engelhardt Kongoro told econoff on 
April 17.  The uncertain political and economic climate plus 
a downturn in sales and sharp competition from new &cowboy8 
entrants to the market had forced the company to re-think its 
network expansion plans.  Kongoro said sales had fallen to 
only 20 percent of the volume in 1999, and the company had 
not issued a dividend since 1995.
