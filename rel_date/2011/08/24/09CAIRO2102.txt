     Â¶B. 10/29 BERNS-OSTERMEIER E-MAIL 
 
(SBU) On October 29, we delivered ref A points to MFA Deputy 
Director for Human Rights Omar Shalaby, urging GOE support 
for the U.S. action plan to strengthen existing human rights 
obligations, and noting U.S. opposition to any new legally 
binding international instruments.  Shalaby said that the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and the Africa 
Group (AG) would not break consensus on the last day of the 
Ad Hoc Committee on Complementary Standards, October 30. 
(Note: Per ref B, we transmitted Shalaby's full response by 
e-mail to IO/HR on October 29.  End note.)  Shalaby said the 
OIC and AG would call for a new optional protocol on October 
30, but that both groups have "no expectation" it will be 
adopted.  Shalaby said the GOE sees no value in re-writing 
human rights law or breaking consensus, and that the GOE 
would review the U.S. action plan.
