¶1.  (U) This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
protect accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On May 24, UNHCR Head of Office Johannes Van der 
Klaauw told poloff that he had submitted a proposal to the 
Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) 
seeking to form a joint registration process for refugees 
and asylum seekers.  The process would allow joint 
recognition of the refugees and asylum seekers by UNHCR and 
the GOM to insure just treatment of recognized refugees 
living in Morocco.  Van der Klaauw said UNHCR is ready to 
provide training on the recognition and handling process of 
refugees and asylum seekers to MOI and MOJ officials and 
Moroccan security forces. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  While Van der Klaauw went on to say that he does 
not believe there is widespread abuse of refugees in Morocco 
he does admit that there are monthly arrests of recognized 
refugees throughout the country.  Oujda, in particular and 
the frontier with Algeria in general are the areas with the 
most frequent problem areas.  Van der Klaauw says security 
officials arrest approximately 30 refugee seekers a month in 
Oujda.  They are generally held for 24 to 48 hours and then 
"turned back" to the border, according to Van der Klaauw. 
He claims that two or three of those arrested each month are 
recognized refugees carrying documentation issued by UNHCR 
in Rabat.  Van der Klaauw says the refugees make their way 
back to Oujda from the frontier and are assisted by local 
NGOs who contact UNHCR headquarters, who in turn arrange to 
have the refugees brought back to Rabat for new papers to 
replace those that are nearly always destroyed by police. 
 
¶4.  (SUB)  Van der Klaauw told poloff that police and 
security forces on the frontier do not recognizing official 
UN documents.  He is aware that local security forces are in 
a difficult position since many migrants enter Morocco with 
false refugee documents provided by traffickers in Algeria. 
Van der Klaauw believes that a joint recognition and 
registration process could alleviate these problems for 
refugees in the region.  Forming a GOM registry and 
supplying the refugees with government identification cards 
would allow them safe passage in the country as well as 
access to legal employment and education. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  When asked about the status of the agreement of 
regularization of UNHCR's relations with the GOM, Van der 
Klaauw groaned that he is reassured weekly by the MOI that 
the agreement will be signed.  He is confident that the 
agreement is forthcoming but as of the meeting with poloff 
there was no official word as to when. 
 
¶6.   (SBU) Turning to the topic of resettlement, Van der 
Klaauw updated poloff on the status of the refugees slated 
to be resettled in the U.S.  He stated that he hoped to have 
at least ten candidates processed by the end of June.  Van 
der Klaauw said that he would have liked to have had more 
ready by that time but delays in the arrival of temporary 
support staff held up the processing. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) In winding up the conversation Van der Klaauw 
mentioned that he has seen growing tension in the Congolese 
refugee community in Rabat, a group that until now has been 
unified and organized.  He said that rumors were circulating 
that a few of the recognized refugees were dictating to 
UNHCR who should and should not be recognized, which has 
resulted in growing resentment in the community.  (Note: 
Poloff also has been contacted by one of the leaders of the 
community who confided that he feared his life was in danger 
due to threats from his countrymen who were refused 
recognition.) 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Comment: After signing the agreement of 
recognition with UNHCR, accepting Van der Klaauw's proposal 
to form a joint refugee recognition office is a constructive 
next step for Morocco to take in order to fulfill its 
international responsibilities.  Morocco has made clear its 
dedication to finding a solution to its migration problem, 
in part, by planning to host an international migration 
conference in July.  However, in addition to finding a 
solution to its main concern of sub-Saharans transiting the 
country on their way to Europe, Morocco needs to face its 
obligations to better understand and deal with the plight of 
recognized refugees living within its borders.
