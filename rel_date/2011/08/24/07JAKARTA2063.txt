BACKGROUND AND GOALS 
FOR DEPUTY SECRETARY NEGROPONTE'S MEETING 
WITH INDONESIAN FM HASAN WIRAJUDA 
ON MARGINS OF ASEAN/ARF MEETINGS IN MANILA, 
5:15 PM ON AUGUST 1, 2007 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
During his visit to Washington in March, FM Wirajuda and the 
Secretary discussed the then-upcoming UNSCR 1747 on Iran's 
 
SIPDIS 
nuclear program and Indonesian initiatives to move the Middle 
East process forward.  Defense Minister Sudarsono visited 
Washington in April to press for continued normalization of 
military-to-military cooperation.  The Indonesians have made 
clear their intention to continue their peacekeeping role in 
Lebanon with the sending of a new battalion late this year to 
replace the one currently there. 
 
SUGGESTED MEETING THEMES 
 
-- Iran: President Yudhoyono weathered heavy public criticism 
for Indonesia's vote in favor of UNSCR 1747, including calls 
for his impeachment, and FM Wirajuda provided lengthy 
testimony in Parliament.  The experience has likely made the 
GOI far more cautious regarding supporting further UNSC 
resolutions on Iran.  While acknowledging the steps they have 
already taken, the Deputy should brief them on our current 
thinking and press for their continued support. 
 
-- Avian Influenza/Sample Sharing: Indonesia is withholding 
human virus samples from the WHO over concerns about 
equitable access to AI vaccines and capacity here to respond 
to a pandemic outbreak.  The WHO is hosting a meeting in 
Singapore from July 31-August 3 to discuss sample sharing 
with the broader international community.  U.S. goals in this 
meeting are (1) to establish a predictable, reliable, and 
efficient system for the sharing of human influenza virus 
samples, both seasonal and pandemic; (2) to ensure broad 
access to samples and sample sequence data by the academic 
and private sector; and (3) to provide health benefits to all 
members in good standing of the system.  The Deputy should 
press Indonesia to finalize its agreement with the WHO so 
that sample sharing on this critical disease can resume. 
 
-- New Middle East Initiative: Wirajuda would be keenly 
interested in hearing about the President's new Middle East 
initiative and the Secretary's travels.  Indonesia has sought 
to provide a voice of moderation on Middle East issues and 
promote Sunni-Shia reconciliation. 
 
-- Military Assistance/Accountability: Indonesia continues to 
make progress to reform its military (TNI) and should be 
encouraged to move further on budget planning and 
transparency, divestiture of business interests and a 
strategic defense review.  However, the TNI continues to lag 
on accountability for past human-rights violations, 
particularly in East Timor in 1999.  The Truth and Friendship 
Commission has not delivered a satisfactory Indonesian 
accounting for such violations in East Timor.  The Deputy 
should note that we are pleased with resumption of normal 
military-to-military ties but warn that lack of 
accountability remains an impediment. 
 
-- Climate Change: The Indonesian government and 
environmental leaders are receptive to President Bush's new 
climate change framework proposal but have emphasized that 
deforestation must be a component of the new framework, that 
Indonesia will need financial and technical assistance to 
implement cleaner technologies and that any new framework 
must fit with ongoing international negotiations on climate 
change.  The Deputy might point out that: 
 
- President Bush's proposal includes plans for addressing 
deforestation and raising the priority of clean energy 
 
JAKARTA 00002063  002 OF 002 
 
 
technologies in the international banks. 
- His proposal will complement ongoing UN negotiations on 
climate change, including the upcoming Conference of Parties 
(COP) meeting in Bali in December. 
 
President Bush has proposed a meeting of the world's top 
13-15 emitters of greenhouse gases at a planned conference in 
Washington in late fall to further define his proposed 
framework.  The Indonesian government has been invited to 
this meeting but not yet confirmed whether it will send 
representatives.  White House Chair of the President's 
Council on Environmental Quality James Connaughton will be in 
Jakarta August 15-16 to explain the President's policy and 
encourage Indonesia's participation.  The Deputy may wish to 
reinforce this message.
