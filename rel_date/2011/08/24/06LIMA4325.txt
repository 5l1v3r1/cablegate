THE ANDEAN COMMUNITY 
 
November 3, 2006 
 
His Excellency 
George W. Bush 
President of the United States of America 
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW 
Washington, DC. 20500 
 
Dear Mr. President: 
 
We want to extend our thanks for your effort in the extension 
of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act 
(ATPDEA).  As beneficiary countries of ATPDEA trade 
preferences, we recognize its importance as a fundamental 
tool for the promotion of economic development and the 
strengthening of commercial relations between the United 
States and our respective countries.  At the same time, we 
believe that the ATPDEA expresses our shared responsibility 
in the fight against narcotics trafficking. 
 
With ATPDEA's assistance, the Andean Region has increased its 
exports and strengthened its common objectives.  Key 
industries in our economies have benefited substantially from 
this legislation, which, at the same time, has generated 
positive and tangible results to our societies in the form of 
higher employment.  This system of commercial preferences for 
the Andean region has been fundamental to promoting 
commercial development in our region.  We want to reiterate 
that the extension of ATPDEA will contribute to the stability 
of the region, a key factor to the advancement of our 
democracies. 
 
We reiterate our thanks for your efforts to fight for ATPDEA 
extension in the hope that this agreement continues to 
generate the benefits that it has achieved to date. 
 
We take this opportunity to express to you our highest 
consideration. 
 
Evo Morales Ayma 
Constitutional President of Bolivia 
 
Alvaro Uribe Velez 
President of the Republic of Colombia 
 
Alfredo Palacio Gonzalez 
Constitutional President of the Republic of Ecuador 
 
Jose Antonio Garcia Belaunde 
(Secretary) Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Peru
