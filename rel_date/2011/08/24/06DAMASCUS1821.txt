¶1.  Summary:  Syrian papers today reported that the Syrian 
Popular Committee to Support the Palestinian People opened 
special accounts at the Real-Estate Bank of Syria and the 
branches of the Commercial Bank of Syria in Damascus, Hama, Homs, 
Lattakia, Aleppo, Tartus, Daraa, Swieda, Der-Ezzor, Kamishli, 
Hasaka and Idleb for donations in support of the Palestinian 
people. The Committee called on Syrian citizens to make 
donations. 
 
Papers also reported that the US Communist Party sent a message 
of solidarity with Syria on the occasion of the 10th Conference 
of the Syrian Communist Party, currently in session in Damascus. 
"The term 'war against terrorism' led by Washington and its ally 
London is being used to block democracy and justify the 
occupation of Iraq," the US Communist Party's message said. 
"The US Communist Party stands against all forms of occupation 
and military bases on foreign lands and against the provocative 
policy of Israel in the Arab region," it added. 
The US Party expressed desire for "a better and deepened 
cooperation based on building a new world free of greed and 
racism."  "The Communist Party Conference is being held during a 
critical stage where the Arab nation, particularly Syria, faces 
big threats that target her steadfastness and struggle for the 
Arab interests," Suleiman Qaddah [Vice Chairman of the National 
Progressive Front] added. 
 
End of summary.

¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
"You Who Live in Glass Houses, Do not Throw Stones" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
Isam Dari, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen, 
commented (4/20): "The US and Europe have denounced the Tel Aviv 
bombing and described it as 'a horrifying brutal act'.... while 
they remain silent on Israel's terrorism.... 
 
 
"Why do the United States and the EU condemn what happened in 
Tel Aviv, which is an individual act resulting from the 
circumstances of coercion, repression, siege, and aggression 
that the Palestinian people are experiencing, while they issue 
no condemnation against the killings, destruction, terrorism, 
and assassinations that Israel perpetrates even against children 
and pregnant women...?" 
 
--------------- 
 
"Weak Pretexts" 
 
--------------- 
 
Omar Jaftali, a commentator in government-owned Tishreen, 
commented (4/20): "The situation in the occupied Arab 
territories after the Tel Aviv operation, which was carried out 
by a Palestinian teenager, does not differ from the situation 
that existed before the operation. For years now, Israeli 
terrorism against the Palestinian people has been a daily 
routine.... 
 
"We regret the blind and illogical international bias that 
justifies Israeli terrorism and sees it as reaction to 
Palestinian 'terrorism'.... 
 
"It is inconceivable to say that the occupier-killer is engaged 
in self-defense while the victim of the aggression and 
occupation is not allowed to react or even condemn. 
 
"A Palestinian who lives under occupation and faces Zionist 
crimes has nothing to use other than his body as a means to 
reject injustice and respond to his executioners.... 
 
"The UN Security Council must shoulder its legal and ethical 
responsibility and take the side of right and justice...." 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
"The Tenth Anniversary of the Qana Massacre" 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
Muhammad al-Khadir, an editorialist in government-owned Al- 
Ba'th, commented (4/20): "Ten years ago more than 100 Lebanese 
civilians, who had sought refuge at a UN base in Qana, were 
killed by Israeli shelling during Operation Grapes of Wrath.... 
 
"The targeting of civilians under the UN flag in 1996 is being 
repeated daily and in various forms by the Israeli occupation 
without any deterrence or international action to end this 
terrorist policy that gives no weight whatsoever to 
international laws and norms. On the contrary, it appears that 
the United States and the EU are in harmony with the Israeli 
policy that seeks to starve out the Palestinians...." 
 
------------------------------------------- 
 
"A US Threshing floor and Angry Harvesters" 
 
------------------------------------------- 
 
Khalid al-Ashhab, an editorialist in government-owned Al-Thawra, 
commented (4/20): "The American war on Iraq has failed to bring 
the claimed democracy to that country or help Iraqis live in 
peace and security. But what is more important is that what at 
first appeared to be a holy war on what was termed world terror 
does not appear so today, especially after that holiness brought 
a tremendous quantity of sins and crimes not only against Iraq 
and the Iraqis, but also against Americans and their sons, as 
more and more coffins return to the United States from a war 
that they now know very well is the war of an obsessed ruling 
group, not a holy war.... 
 
"The winds of change are blowing against the United States, and 
 
the opposition to Rumsfeld's policies is in fact opposition to 
the policies of President Bush and his team...." 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
"Do not Think, We Are Thinking on Your Behalf" 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
Ali Nasrallah, an editorialist in government-owned Al-Thawra, 
commented (4/20: "The West does not want Iran and the developing 
world to advance scientifically and technologically.... The West 
argues that oil-rich Iran has no need for nuclear energy.... 
 
"It is for Iran, not others, to decide whether it needs to 
develop its energy sources. Through this, Iran is exercising a 
right acknowledged by international law. The 'free democratic 
world' should abandon its arrogance and stop its attempt to 
fabricate a losing battle with Iran...."
