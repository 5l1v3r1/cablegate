SUBJECT: DAKAR FRAUD SUMMARY - SECOND QUARTER FY2007 
 
REF: A. 05 STATE 205073 
      ¶B. DAKAR 0355 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Embassy Dakar's quarterly fraud reporting cable for the 
second quarter (January-March) of FY2007 follows.  Responses are 
keyed to Ref A. 
 
¶A.  COUNTRY CONDITIONS:  Since the last report, there has been no 
significant change in the economic situation.  The current political 
situation continues to be characterized by tense competition between 
the ruling party, the "Parti Democratique Senegalais," and the 
opposition parties.  The presidential election took place as 
scheduled on February 25 without violence.  Though the opposition 
contested the results, the Constitutional Council declared them 
valid since the shortcomings and flaws during the voting process 
were not substantial and significant enough to invalidate the 
election.  The major opposition parties are boycotting legislative 
elections scheduled for June 3, 2007. 
 
¶B.  NON-IMMIGRANT (NIV) FRAUD:  Two Senegalese passports with valid 
B1/B2 visas were reported stolen. 
 
¶C.  IMMIGRANT VISA (IV) FRAUD:  In this quarter, Post returned 35 
petitions to USCIS for review with the recommendation that they be 
revoked.  Post requested Advisory Opinions for 12 ineligibility 
findings under INA section 212(a)(6)(C)(i) because of identity 
fraud.  In all 12 cases, the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) 
revealed that the applicants had previously applied for immigrant 
and non-immigrant visas under different names and dates of birth. 
VO concurred with Post in all 12 instances.  Post found seven 
immigrant visa applicants ineligible under INA section 
212(a)(9)(B)(ii). 
 
¶D.  DV FRAUD:  Post has been unable to verify the authenticity of 
Gambian documents because The Gambian Government charges a fee to 
verify documents.  As a result, it has been difficult to verify 
educational credentials submitted by Gambian DV winners. 
 
¶E.  ACS AND PASSPORT FRAUD:  No change. 
 
¶F.  ADOPTION FRAUD:  During this quarter, post received its first 
IR3/IR4 visa application for an orphan adopted in Senegal.  The case 
had numerous fraud indicators and is currently under investigation. 
While the number of IR3/IR4 visa applications for orphans adopted in 
Sierra Leone has decreased significantly, we continue to receive new 
cases.  During this quarter, Embassy Freetown completed field 
investigations to confirm the orphan status of six adopted orphans, 
of which only four were orphans under INA section 101(b)(1)(F). 
There are three pending orphan field investigations.  At the 
direction of VO, Post issued one IR3 to an adopted orphan after 
USCIS reaffirmed an I-600 petition despite the fact that the child 
has two living birth parents and the birth mother did not personally 
sign the relinquishment statement presented as evidence of orphan 
status. 
 
¶G.  ASYLUM AND OTHER DHS BENEFITS FRAUD:  No change. 
 
¶H.  COOPERATION WITH HOST GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES:  No change. 
 
¶I.  AREA OF PARTICULAR CONCERN:  No change. 
 
¶J.  STAFFING AND TRAINING:  The Fraud Prevention Coordinator, a 
Consular Associate, attended the All-Africa Fraud Conference in 
Accra, Ghana.  The training was very beneficial to Post.
