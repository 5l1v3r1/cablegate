SUBJECT: TURKEY/IRAQ: MFA STATEMENT ON AL-ASKARIYA SHRINE 
BOMBING 
 
REF: STATE 28802 
 
OnFebruary 22, the Turkish Foreign Ministry issue the 
following statement regarding the al-Askariya Shrine bombing 
and its aftermath.  Unofficial Embassy translation follows. 
 
Begin text. 
 
We regret and strongly condemn the bomb attacks in Iraq that 
caused the deaths of 22 people in Baghdad yesterday and those 
launched against the Askariya shrine in Samarra today, as 
well as a series of terrorist attacks launched against Sunni 
mosques. 
 
It is apparent that those who resort to terrorism aim to 
start ethnic and sectarian clashes in Iraq.  The most 
efficient way to disrupt this game is to avoid retaliation 
and enhance national harmony, without falling prey to 
provocations. 
 
We wish God's compassion on those who lost their lives and we 
extend our condolences to their relatives, the Iraqi people, 
and the government. 
 
End text.
