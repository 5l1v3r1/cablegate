¶1. (U) This is a PRT Babil cable. 
 
¶2. (U) The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq's (ISCI) latest 
campaign venture in Babil province is the Safwa ("Pure") 
Gathering.  This organization focuses its efforts at college and 
secondary-school students who are nearing or have recently 
entered the voting-aged ranks.  (Note: Voter eligibility age 
will be defined by the draft elections law currently in the 
Council of Representatives, and will require having reached 18 
years of age in either the month or year in which the elections 
take place.  End Note.)  Predominantly active at Babil 
University, the Safwa leadership has spent the past two months 
organizing its ranks of next-generation voters. 
 
¶3. (U) ISCI regional slate coordinator Sayyid Shihab al-Yassiri 
(aka Hafud al-Yassiri) [reftel] held a conference at the Babil 
Labor Union convention center, adjacent to the Badr Office 
Headquarters, on June 21 to further the Safwa Gathering's 
efforts.  In attendance were Babil Governor Salam Salih al-Mahdi 
al-Muslimawi, ISCI and Badr officials, and more than one hundred 
college students. 
 
¶4. (U) While secondary school students prepare their late June 
final examinations, the ISCI leaders distributed files 
containing examinations from previous years.  Although these 
files are regularly available for purchase at local markets, 
rarely are they distributed for free by politicians.  Even more 
uncommon is the cover page on the version distributed by the 
Safwa Gathering - photographs of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, 
Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim, and Ayatollah Sayid Muhammad Baqir 
al-Hakim.
