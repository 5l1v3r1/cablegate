SUBJECT: GREECE: CONTACT GROUP FOR PIRACY OFF THE COAST OF SOMALIA 
(CGPCS) AND COMMITMENTS REGARDING INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BEST 
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 
 
REF: STATE 90045 
 
¶1. (SBU) On August 31 we delivered reftel message to Greek MFA D1 
Directorate (UN and International Organizations Affairs) Counselor 
Dimitris Papandreou, inviting Greece to join other countries that 
are among the 20 largest ship registries to sign the Commitment to 
Best Management Practices to Avoid, Deter or Delay Acts of Piracy 
on September 9 in New York.  Papandreou expressed appreciation for 
the invitation, and he subsequently disseminated the draft text for 
comment within the Greek government and shipping industry, setting 
an internal deadline of September 4 for input.  Papandreou, who 
will attend the CGPCS meeting in New York, expressed interest in 
any information we could provide about which other countries were 
willing to sign the declaration.  He pledged to provide the Greek 
response as soon as possible. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) We also discussed the issue September 2 with Greek 
Ministry of Mercantile Marine diplomatic advisor Nicolas 
Protonotarios, encouraging his Ministry to support the initiative. 
Protonotarios confirmed he had received our proposal from the MFA, 
and said that although he could not provide a final answer yet he 
did not see any problem in principle with the proposal.  He noted 
that piracy was a major concern of the Ministry of Mercantile 
Marine, and expressed eagerness to work with the U.S. and the rest 
of the international community on further steps to combat it. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post remains in contact with both ministries and will 
inform Washington of any further Greek response when it is 
received.  We would appreciate additional information from 
Washington on plans for the signing ceremony and the number of 
countries who have agreed to sign, when such information becomes 
available, so that we could share it with the Greeks.
