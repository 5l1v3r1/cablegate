¶1. This is a Basra PRT reporting cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary: Basra PRT hosted an Eid al-Fitr (end of 
Ramadan) event on September 23 for an estimated 130 guests from 
a broad swath of Basrawi society.  The event took place at a new 
downtown Basra luxury hotel, significant itself, as it further 
demonstrated the growing "normalcy" of the city.  It was the 
first USG-hosted event in Basra outside of a fortified USG 
structure since the 1967 closing of the Basra consulate.  In his 
welcoming remarks, Basra Team Leader noted that the U.S. 
military presence and large scale reconstruction assistance will 
continue to wind down, while a civilian diplomatic and 
development assistance presence would persist.  Perhaps the most 
significant theme of the night was the number of high-profile 
Basrawis openly mingling with USG officials in a gleaming new 
downtown hotel.  This Eid celebration was a significant signpost 
and an event that would have been unthinkable even one year ago. 
 End Summary. 
 
Honoring Eid al-Fitr 
==================== 
 
¶3. (SBU) To honor the end of the Ramadan season, PRT Basra 
invited contacts from provincial politics, media, business, 
religion (including minority Christians and Sunnis), feminists, 
NGOs, military, and police to a traditional dinner at a newly 
completed hotel in downtown Basra.  The celebration's featured 
guest was Member of Parliament Sayyid Ayyad Jamal al-Deen 
(former INL, currently with the Independent Shi'a group).  Three 
dozen USG officials from the PRT, 34th Infantry Division (ID), 
and 17th Fires Brigade also attended.  To the best of the PRT's 
knowledge, this is the first USG-hosted event outside of any USG 
structure since the 1967 closing of the U.S. consulate in Basra 
in the wake of the Six Day War and Iraq's breaking of diplomatic 
relations. 
 
Auspicious venue 
================ 
 
¶4. (SBU) The venue was the brand new, $15 million "Mnawi Basha," 
a 120-room, "five star" (by Iraqi standards) hotel.  The PRT 
hosting this event at this central downtown location, away from 
the apparent safety of our campus (eight miles west of Basra), 
was notable.  For many locals, the hotel is a hopeful symbol of 
a new and better Basra.  Local contacts had been urging us for 
the past two years to host any such high-profile events inside 
the city.  Several guests praised PRTOffs for hosting the event 
at the hotel noting that it further demonstrated the "normalcy" 
of their city.  Coordinated security was provided by the 34th ID 
and Iraqi Security Forces.  The hotel owners told the PRT that 
they have already seen a marked increase in occupancy rates, 
including from European, British, and some U.S. businesspeople. 
 
High turnout, VIP faces in the crowd 
==================================== 
 
¶5. (SBU) A high percentage - about 130 of 170 - of invited 
guests attended the Eid dinner, including Governor Shiltagh 
(Da'wa Islamiya), several Provincial Council members, Directors 
General (DG) and deputy DGs of several key agencies, and Muslim 
and Christian leaders.  The high attendance rate also reflects 
well on PRT relations with the governor, given that many of them 
require the governor's permission to make even the most minor 
decision, including attendance events such as this.  More 
importantly, guests expressed no apparent reluctance to be seen 
with members of the PRT.  While the high turnout was partly 
attributable to the usual group of contacts attending, including 
those eager for PRT money for pet projects, a lot of other 
guests showed up as well. 
 
Team Leader remarks 
=================== 
 
¶6. (SBU) In his welcoming remarks, Basra Team Leader honored 
Basrawis on the end of the Ramadan season.  He also took the 
opportunity to stress again that the large U.S. military 
presence - and large scale reconstruction assistance - will - 
continue winding down.  At the same time, he noted that an 
enduring civilian diplomatic and development assistance presence 
would continue, representing a more stable and "normal" 
bilateral relationship. 
 
Iraqis also getting better acquainted with themselves 
============================================= ======== 
 
¶7. The event was an opportunity to bring disparate groups of 
Basrawis together.  While many of this diverse crowd appeared to 
interact well - Christians talking to Muslims, Shi'as with 
Sunnis, media with security forces, all in the heartland of 
Iraqi Shi'sm - several guests found themselves spending time 
with people with whom they would not normally.  One group of

guests who found themselves at the same table included a 
visually impaired director of an NGO assisting visually impaired 
citizens, two prominent journalists, and the Basra Province 
commanding general.  The journalists and general later 
separately thanked the PRT for having invited and recognized the 
NGO director, that it had been an honor to be with him, and it 
was a reminder for Iraqis to focus on and appreciate more its 
own disabled citizens. 
 
Comment: An encouraging signpost 
================================ 
 
¶8. (SBU) Occasionally, in the long, two-step-forward, 
one-step-back challenge that is the USG presence in Iraq, we 
experience a truly encouraging signpost along the way.  This 
event was one of them.  While the occasion will be followed by 
many challenges, it is important to take note of the fact that 
an open, public, USG-sponsored affair in the heart of Basra 
would have been unthinkable even one year ago.  The event also 
appeared to discredit the thought that Basrawis do not want to 
be seen with the PRT, or in some instances, with each other. 
The PRT's guests appreciated this gesture to reach out and honor 
them on one of their most sacred and festive holidays.  While 
PRT Basra members engage their contacts off of the FOB 
consistently, the more Basrawis see us and get to know the PRT 
specifically and Americans generally, the less fear and 
misunderstanding there is.NALAND
