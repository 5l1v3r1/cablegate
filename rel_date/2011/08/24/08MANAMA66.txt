SUBJECT: NO GOVERNMENT APPEAL AGAINST JUDGES' DECISION IN 
TERRORIST CELL CASE 
 
REF: MANAMA 20 AND PREVIOUS 
 
(SBU) The deadline for appeals in the terrorist cell case 
(reftels) passed on January 30 with neither the prosecution 
nor the defense opting to take action.  Chief Prosecutor 
Nawaf Al-Mouada confirmed to Poloff on February 3 that 
Bahrain's senior-most prosecutor, Ali bin Fadhul Al-Buainain, 
had decided not to pursue an appeal of the January 16 
verdict.  For their part, defense attorneys had stated 
previously that they would not appeal the verdict either, 
viewing the six-month sentences as the equivalent of an 
acquittal.  Al-Mouada also confirmed that Ishaaq Faheem 
Ishaaq Abd al-Rahman, Abdulrahman Mohammad Jaffar Ali, and 
Ali Eid Muttar Jassim were released shortly after the 
announcement of the verdict, and, with credit for time 
served, have completed their sentences.
