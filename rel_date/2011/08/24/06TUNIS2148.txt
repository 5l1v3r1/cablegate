REF: DOC 03822 
 
¶1.  Reftel requests verification of computer parts and 
accessories shipped to ultimate consignee: IGL Industries, 
route de Gabes, km8 Sfax, Tunisia.  Liscense code for these 
products is C33 NLR.  In order to arrange the on-site 
verification visit, commercial specialist faxed parts 
information and spoke with Mrs. Saoussen Bradai, head of 
IGL's purchasing department and her supervisor, Mr. Noomane. 
Both Mr. Noomane and Mrs Bradai indicated that the subject 
parts are no longer at IGL Industries.  These were computer 
parts which are used in the manufacture of microcomputers. 
The microcomputers are then sold under the 'Versus' 
brandname.  IGL's end products can be viewed on their 
website: www.versus.com.tn. 
 
¶2.  While Econoff was welcome to visit IGL, both 
interlocutors said that they would be on vacation through the 
end of August (note: Tunisians work half days during the 
summer months and August is the prime vacation month).  If 
DOC/BIS advises, Post is willing to conduct a physical 
post-shipment verification which would consist of an on-site 
visit to review documentation of invoices and sales receipts 
related to subject computer parts and a tour of the plant. 
In this case, Post requests funding for EconOff, Commercial 
specialist and driver to travel to Sfax and conduct the 
verification.  Funding should include travel costs and per 
diem for 2 days (overnight trip).
