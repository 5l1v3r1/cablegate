¶1. (SBU) On June 4, Econoff contacted Maren Lipps, Pakistan 
Desk Officer, German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (BMZ), to express appreciation for Germany's 
prompt response to the Pakistan Internally Displaced Persons 
(IDP) crisis and to urge quick disbursement of the German 
pledge (REF A).  Lipps confirmed Germany's concern over the 
humanitarian situation in Pakistan and that BMZ would 
contribute 20 million euros for Pakistan IDPs in 2009-2010 
(REF B).  There are three components to this sum: 1) 5 
million euros announced on May 15, 2009 to be channeled via 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); 2) 
5 million euros previously committed via the World Food 
Program (WFP); and 3) 10 million euros via UNHCR's 
Refugee-Affected and Hosting Areas (RAHA) Initiative.  Lipps 
explained that BMZ considered the first two components 
"emergency aid" that could be disbursed as needed in either 
2009 or 2010.  She added that BMZ had already disbursed the 5 
million euros committed to WFP. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Pakistan Desk 
Officer Tobias Grothe confirmed that during 2009 the MFA has 
pledged 2.6 million euros in support of Pakistani IDPs, above 
and beyond the BMZ contribution.  Originally, 1 million euros 
was budgeted for assisting the IDPs, but an additional 1.6 
million euros has been announced in recent weeks in reaction 
to the worsening situation.  The most recent additional 
pledge (1 million euros) was announced by Foreign Minister 
Frank-Walter Steinmeier on May 20.  In response to our 
request that the MFA pledge be disbursed as quickly as 
possible, Grothe indicated that 1.6 million euros had already 
been disbursed and that the most recent pledge of 1 million 
would be "on its way soon, if not already gone." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Grothe noted that BMZ was also contributing 10 
million euros in 2009 to the Refugee-Affected and Hosting 
Areas (RAHA) initiative to assist Afghan refugees in 
Pakistan.  While the RAHA program did not directly target 
Pakistani IDPs, Grothe pointed out that it still had benefits 
for Pakistani IDPs.  (NOTE: Post assumes that the $17.6 
million cited in REF A as Germany,s pledged contribution to 
the IDP crisis in 2009 is the dollar equivalent sum of BMZ's 
5 million euro pledge via UNHCR, its 5 million euro 
commitment to WFP, and the 2.6 million euros from the MFA, 
and that it does not include the separate BMZ contribution to 
RAHA.)
