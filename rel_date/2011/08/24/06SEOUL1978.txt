REF: STATE 95184 
 
(SBU) On June 14, poloff delivered reftel points, which 
requested ROK support for amendments to the Statutes of the 
International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, to Lee 
Ong-young, Deputy Director of the Human Rights and Social 
Affairs Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade.  Lee noted that the ROKG shared a similar position 
with the USG on the Third Protocol.  The ROKG would vote in 
favor of changing the Statutes to reflect the adoption of the 
Third Protocol at the June 20-21 International Conference of 
the Red Cross and the Red Crescent.  Seoul would oppose any 
efforts seeking an early adjournment.  Representatives of the 
ROK mission in Geneva will attend the conference as senior 
ROK officials planned to accompany Foreign Minister Ban 
Ki-moon to the inaugural UN HRC session.  Lee added that the 
ROKG would also convey reftel points to its mission in Geneva.
