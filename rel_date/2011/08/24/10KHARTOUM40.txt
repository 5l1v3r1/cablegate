¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On January 5, the Assessment and Evaluation 
Commission (AEC) held its 50th plenary meeting.  In light of the 
recent passage of the Southern Sudan Referendum Law, Abyei 
Referendum Law and Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan Popular 
Consultations Law, members noted that implementation must begin as 
soon as possible.  The AEC emphasized that post-referendum 
discussions between the National Congress Party (NCP) and Sudan 
People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) should begin immediately. 
Ambassador Derek Plumbly, Chairman of the AEC, noted that salary 
arrears in Abyei have been paid, though further 2010 budget planning 
is needed.  The NCP and SPLM may extend with the impending 
discussion of the difficult post-referendum issues.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During the January 5 AEC plenary meeting, Chairman Derek 
Plumbly noted that Sudan will pass the 5th anniversary of the CPA 
signing on January 9.  Plumbly noted that while there are some 
successes to celebrate, there is much still to be done.  Following 
the approval of the Southern Sudan Referendum Law, Abyei Referendum 
Law and Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan Popular Consultation Law, 
milestones in fulfilling the CPA, Plumbly noted that it is time to 
begin immediate implementation of these laws (reftels). 
 
----------------------------------- 
IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION IMPERATIVE 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Virtually every member of the AEC noted the importance of 
implementing the recently-agreed laws as soon as possible.  Ray 
Kennedy, Chief UNMIS Electoral Affairs Officer, said  that the 
Southern Sudan and Aybei Referenda Commissions need to be set up 
right away  to avoid further delays in "decisions that are already 
overdue".  Plumbly stated that since Southern Sudan Referendum 
commissioners must be approved by the National Legislature (a joint 
session of the National Assembly and Council of States), as 
stipulated by law, it is essential that the NCP and SPLM move 
quickly to nominate members.  The SPLM representation requested the 
UN electoral affairs office provide the parties with a timeline of 
essential deadlines for Southern Sudan referendum planning, which 
will help the parties to understand the deadlines they should meet. 
Minister Kosti Manibe, Government of National Unity Minister of 
Cabinet Affairs and senior member of the SPLM, stated that during an 
Institute for Security Studies (ISS) conference hosted in 
Johannesburg, South Africa, the SPLM and NCP were told that East 
Timor organized a referendum in three months.  Minister Kosti 
questioned why Sudan cannot do the same thing and insinuated that 
international pressure to expedite implementation of the laws was 
unnecessary.  Kennedy stated that the East Timor Referendum was 
organized with all normal international procurement rules waived, 
extraordinary political will and intensive international support, 
which does not reflect the current environment in Sudan. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
INTIATING POST REFERENDUM ISSUES DISCUSSION 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) AEC members stressed the need to help facilitate 
post-referendum discussions promptly.  Plumbly noted that the United 
States, African Union and European Community have agreed to work 
together to facilitate discussions and provide the necessary 
technical expert's.  The NCP and SPLM seemed noncommittal about who 
would be involved in these talks, although subsequently the SPLM 
delivered a series of papers detailing how it plans to approach the 
post-referendum discussions.

ABYEI BACK SALARIES PAID 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) The IGAD observer noted Misseriya concerns with the 
recently-agreed Abyei Referendum Law.  He stated that the law cannot 
be presumed final since the President is planning to meet with 
Misseriya members of the legislative assembly in connection with 
their concerns.  The NCP representative agreed that the concerns of 
the Misseriya are concerns of the Government of Sudan.  Plumbly 
acknowledged that not all constituencies in the area are in 
agreement with the Abyei Referendum Law.  He emphasized that the 
parties must strive to inform and reassure the Misseriya about the 
terms of the law and the future of Abyei, while providing the 
Misseriya with greater development opportunities.  Regarding 
progress on the Abyei budget, Plumbly noted that while some 
employees of the Abyei administration, including the police, had 
recently received up to seven months back pay, and salaries for the 
2010 budget have been determined, significant operational aspects of 
the 2010 Abyei budget remain incomplete.

¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: The NCP and SPLM representatives to the AEC did 
not seem to feel the urgency of implementing the Southern Sudan 
Referendum, Abyei Referendum and Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan 
Popular Consultation Laws but in separate conversations other more 
senior SPLM and NCP officials indicated that they understand the 
urgency of dealing with post-referendum issues such as nationality 
and wealth -sharing END COMMENT.
