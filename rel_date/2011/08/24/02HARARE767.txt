¶1.   EDITORIALS IN THE MAINSTREAM NEWSPAPERS CONTINUE 
   TO 
   FOCUS ON THE HOTLY DISPUTED PRESIDENTIAL POLL IN 
   ZIMBABWE.  EXCERPTS FOLLOW: 
 
¶2.   UNDER HEADLINE "A REGIME BENT ON VIOLENCE, 
   CORRUPTION WON'T GET AID," THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE 
   DAILY NEWS" (03/25) COMMENTS: 
 
   ". . .IN LAST WEEK'S CONFERENCE. . .IN MONTERREY, 
   (MEXICO), PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH OF THE UNITED 
   STATES LINKED AID TO GOOD GOVERNANCE.  CLEARLY, 
   WORLD POVERTY HAS TO BE TACKLED WITH THE FULL 
   KNOWLEDGE THAT UNLESS A COUNTRY GOVERNS ITS PEOPLE 
   WITH FAIRNESS, IT CANNOT EXPECT TO ATTRACT MUCH 
   HELP TO REDUCE POVERTY.  LIKE ANY OTHER AFRICAN 
   COUNTRIES, ZIMBABWE HAS NOT ALWAYS BEHAVED 
   RESPONSIBLY WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY, PARTICULARLY 
   FOR POVERTY ALLEVIATION.  THE CONDUCT OF THE 
   PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION HAS BEEN SO OVERWHELMINGLY 
   CONDEMNED AS A TRAVESTY OF FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE 
   THAT THE FEW FRIENDS WHO HAD STUCK WITH US AFTER 
   THE KILLINGS OF THE 2000 ELECTION CAMPAIGN HAVE 
   DECIDED THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH.  ON ITS PRESENT 
   RECORD OF VIOLENCE AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE, THE 
   GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT MUGABE IS UNLIKELY TO FIND 
   TOO MANY COUNTRIES WILLING TO HELP IT END POVERTY 
   AMONG ITS PEOPLE.  AS LONG AS THE KILLINGS 
   CONTINUE, NO CONFERENCE ON POVERTY IS LIKELY TO 
   HELP A REGIME SO COMMITTED TO VIOLENCE."

¶3.   UNDER HEADLINE "EU BULLYING TACTICS GOING TOO 
   FAR," THE BULAWAYO-BASED GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED DAILY 
   (03/25) COMMENTS: 
 
   "THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). . .IS TAKING ITS BULLYING 
   TACTICS TOO FAR.  IT STILL HOLDS THE ILL-ADVISED 
   BELIEF THAT ITS RACIST MEMBERSHIP HAS THE DIVINE 
   RIGHT TO DECIDE THE FATE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. 
   MAYBE THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME TO REMIND THE EU THAT 
   ZIMBABWE IS NO LONGER A BRITISH COLONY TO BE TOLD 
   AT EVERY TURN WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO DO IT.  WE 
   DEMAND THAT THE BRITISH AND THEIR RACIST FRIENDS 
   ABANDON THE BLACKMAIL THEY ARE TRYING TO APPLY ON 
   ZIMBABWE BECAUSE IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND 
   RESOURCES.  NOW, WE WANT TO BE RESPECTED AS AN 
   EQUAL MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS." 
 
¶4.   UNDER HEADLINE "MUDENGE KNOWS HE IS TALKING 
   NONSENSE," THE INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE STANDARD" 
   (03/24) COMMENTS: 
 
   "DR. STAN MUDENGE, ZIMBABWE'S FOREIGN MINISTER, HAS 
   AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT JOB, CONSIDERING ALL THE 
   CLEANING UP HE HAS TO DO AFTER MUGABE.  BUT THAT'S 
   NO EXCUSE FOR HIM TO TALK NONSENSE.  HIS RESPONSE 
   THIS WEEK TO ZIMBABWE'S SUSPENSION FROM THE 
   COMMONWEALTH IS A CASE IN POINT.  IN AN ANGRY 
   RESPONSE TO THE DECISION BY THE COMMONWEALTH TROIKA 
   ON ZIMBABWE TO SUSPEND THE COUNTRY FROM THE 
   COMMONWEALTH FOR A YEAR. . .MUDENGE FLATLY STATED 
   THAT THE ZIMBABWE GOVERNMENT REJECTED THE REPORT.

PAGE 04        HARARE  00767  01 OF 02  251337Z 
   MUDENGE SAYS THE DECISION TO SUSPEND ZIMBABWE FROM 
   THE COMMONWEALTH FOR 12 MONTHS UNDERMINED THE 
   CREDIBILITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH.  WE ARE OF THE 
   OPINION THAT THE COMMONWEALTH'S REPUTATION WOULD 
   HAVE BEEN MORE IN JEOPARDY HAD IT NOT TAKEN ACTION 
   AGAINST A TRUANT ADMINISTRATION THAT OVER A GOOD 36 
   MONTHS HAS PERFECTED THE ART OF DUCKING AND DIVING. 
   .NO ACTION SHOULD BE SPARED IN BRINGING TO BOOK A 
   POWER HUNGRY DESPOT WHO WILL USE ALL LEGAL AND 
   ILLEGAL MEANS TO REMAIN IN POWER, LONG PAST HIS 
   SELL-BY DATE." 
 
¶5.   UNDER HEADLINE "WHY MUST THE BRUTALITY AND 
   KILLINGS CONTINUE?" THE INDEPENDENT DAILY "THE DAILY 
   NEWS" (03/23) COMMENTS: 
 
   ".MORE THAN 10 PEOPLE HAVE DIED SINCE THE VOTING 
   ENDED, ALMOST TWO WEEKS GO.  MANY OTHERS BEAR FRESH 
   SCARS INFLICTED ON THEM BY SUPPORTERS OF THE RULING 
   PARTY OR SO-CALLED WAR VETERANS.  YET OTHERS HAVE 
   BECOME INTERNAL REFUGEES, DISPLACED FROM THEIR

   RURAL HOMES BY A WAVE OF RETRIBUTION UNLEASHED BY 
   GOVERNMENT SUPPORTERS.  THE ONLY CRIME TO HAVE BEEN 
   COMMITTED BY VICTIMS OF THE CURRENT 'CARAVAN' OF 
   TERROR IS THAT THEY ARE SUSPECTED OF BEING MEMBERS 
   OF THE OPPOSITION MDC, LEGAL OPPOSITION PARTY.  IT 
   IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE UNITY WHEN COERCION IS 
   EMPLOYED INSTEAD OF PERSUASION.  IT IS 
   CONTRADICTORY TO RECOGNIZE THE DIVERSITY OF 
   OPINIONS AND YET AT THE SAME TIME SEEK TO DENY OR 
   PUNISH ANYONE HOLDING VIEWS CONTRARY TO ONE'S OWN. 
   IF MUGABE WAS SINCERE IN HIS CALL FOR UNITY, AND IF 
   HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE ENJOYED THE CONFIDENCE AND 
   SUPPORT IF THE 56,2 PERCENT OF THE 2,9 MILLION 
   VOTERS IN THE COUNTRY WHO TOOK PART IN THE 
   ELECTION, THEN HE WOULD HAVE STARTED BY DISMANTLING 
   THE (TORTURE CAMPS) SET UP BY ZANU PF YOUTH 
   BRIGADES.  HE WOULD ALSO HAVE ORDERED THE POLICE TO 
   CLAMP DOWN ON THOSE RUNNING AROUND THE COUNTRY 
   CAUSING MAYHEM AND BEHAVING AS IF THEY ARE ABOVE 
   THE LAW.  HE WOULD HAVE ORDERED THE SECURITY AGENTS 
   TO ENSURE ALL ACTS OF LAWLESSNESS AND THE FARM 
   INVASIONS STOPPED FORTHWITH.  BUT THERE IS A FAR 
   MORE SINISTER INFERENCE THAT CAN BE MADE HERE.  IT 
   IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DARING THE INTERNATIONAL 
   COMMUNITY TO OSTRACIZE IT SO THAT IT BECOMES FREE 
   OF ANY INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION TO UPHOLD HUMAN 
   RIGHTS AND OTHER RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS THAT GO 
   WITH A GOVERNMENT THAT IS A MEMBER OF THE WORLD 
   COMMUNITY.  INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION WOULD CREATE 
   THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR DECLARING A STATE OF 
   EMERGENCY AND THE GOVERNMENT WOULD THEN BE FREE TO

¶6.   UNDER HEADLINE "THE PEOPLE WANT PEACE," THE 
   INDEPENDENT WEEKLY "THE ZIMBABWE MIRROR" (03/22) 
   COMMENTS: 
 
   ".IT IS CRUCIAL FOR PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT IN 
   ZIMBABWE THAT MORGAN TSVANGIRAI AND HIS FOLLOWERS 
   INDULGE IN A CAREFUL AND HONEST ASSESSMENT OF BOTH 
   THE BALANCE OF FORCES AND THE MOOD OF THE MASS OF 
   THE PEOPLE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE PRESIDENTIAL 
   ELECTION.  AS WE HAVE ALREADY STATED. . .PEOPLE ARE 
   TIRED OF THE POLITICS OF CONFRONTATION AND SIMPLY 
   WANT PEACE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET DOWN TO THE 
   BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUES THAT ARE ALREADY SO 
   CRUCIAL.  AS PRESIDENTS MBEKI AND OBASANJO 
   INTIMATED EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE MDC AND ZANU PF 
   SHOULD PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES AND ENGAGE IN 
   DIALOGUE.  IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THE DIALOGUE WILL 
   BEGIN SOON IN PARLIAMENT, WITH THE DEBATE TOWARDS A 
   NEW CONSTITUTION, TOWARDS A NEW ERA FOR ZIMBABWE."
