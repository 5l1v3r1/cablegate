TRIPOLI 00001026  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Three SLA/Unity representatives visiting 
Tripoli said December 9 that Abdallah Yehia is the unquestioned 
leader of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA)/Unity branch and 
that SLA/Unity is open to an agreement with the newly-formed 
United Revolutionary Front (URF), though serious talks between 
the two groups have yet to begin.  They dismissed any efforts to 
bring the Fur into the predominantly Zaghawa URF and SLA/Unity 
grouping, stressing that military strength on the ground should 
determine representation in the peace talks.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  PolOff and P/E Chief met with three SLA/Unity 
representatives currently in Tripoli - Osman Muhammad Busra (a 
political rep of Abdullah Yehia who has been physically present 
in Libya since July), Mahjub Hussein (an SLA/Unity spokesman 
resident in London who's been in Libya since mid-November), and 
Abubakr Kadu (described as the senior SLA/Unity field 
commander).  Kadu arrived in Tripoli on/about November 29 from 
Juba and departs for Darfur on/about December 13. 
 
YEHIA IS CLEAR LEADER OF SLA/UNITY 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  According to the SLA/Unity delegation, Abdallah Yehia 
is the unquestioned political leader of the SLA/Unity branch. 
Suleiman Jamous and Sharif Harir are "just members" of the 
SLA/Unity government council.  They were dismissive of 
suggestions Jamous might be in direct contact with Justice and 
Equality / Collective (JEM/CL) leader Bahar Idriss Abu Gharda. 
Busra was vague on the status of talks between JEM/CL and 
SLA/Unity, implying that only after both groups returned to the 
field on/about December 13 would they consider talking about 
some form of "alliance."  SLA/Unity will only consider an 
agreement with the URF that makes Abdallah Yehia the new group's 
leader.  Kadu boasted that JEM/CL has only five percent of the 
fighters he has under his command. 
 
SLA/UNITY DISMISSIVE OF TRIBAL DIMENSTIONS OF DARFUR CONFLICT 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  All three dismissed the idea that there were tribal 
or ethnic dimensions to both the Darfur conflict and the UN/AU 
political process, and were similarly dismissive of any efforts 
to bring the Fur on board in any URF-SLA grouping. (Note: 
Although Hussein later bristled at the suggestion that he might 
be a member of the Zaghawa tribe, emphatically insisting that he 
was Nubian.  End note.)  "Any peace process with tribal 
underpinnings will fail," said Busra.  They dismissed the idea 
that Fur leaders possess significant military strength; indeed, 
they described Abdulshafi and Diraige as militarily irrelevant. 
At the same time, they stressed SLA/Unity was inclusive of 
non-Zaghawa.  Peace requires participation by forces with 
significant military strength (SLA/Unity and JEM/CL) and one 
delegation comprising both the IDPs and refugees. 
 
KHALIL, NOT ABDULWAHID, NECESSARY FOR PEACE AGREEMENT 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The three spoke at length about Abdulwahid, 
characterizing him as a "historic" figure, but one who has 
ultimately not kept up with the changing situation on the 
ground.  He continues to see himself as the new John Garang. 
Hussein said he was in Paris in November and refused to meet 
with Abdulwahid, whom he described as "a liar".  While they 
conceded Abdulwahid has some support among youth in the IDP 
camps, he does not represent all of Darfur's marginalized 
people.  All three said without hesitation that Abdulwahid's 
participation was not necessary for a meaningful peace agreement. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  By contrast, they assessed that Khalil Ibrahim's 
participation in the peace process is important, stressing that 
Khalil is still in a position to influence the security 
situation in Darfur (by contrast with Abdulwahid).  They noted 
favorably that Khalil had sent a representative to Juba.  All 
three had positive things to say about JEM/CL leader Bahar Abu 
Gharda, praising his commitment to people "in the field" and his 
attendance at the October 27 Sirte meeting.  "Bahar is 
interested in cooperating with SLA/Unity," said Busra, noting an 
alliance between Yehia and Abu Gharda is "definitely possible." 
 
SLA/UNITY EAGER TO "COOPERATE" WITH UNAMID 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Busra asked to deliver a three-part message to the 
USG: (1) the GOS is a dictatorial regime; (2) the US should 
therefore play a political as well as humanitarian role in 
Darfur (implying the USG should choose sides between the rebels 
and the GOS); and (3) SLA/Unity will not obstruct the UNAMID 
deployment and would like to "actively cooperate" with 
international peacekeepers. 
 
SATISFACTION WITH LIBYAN HOSTS 
 
TRIPOLI 00001026  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  SLA/Unity is satisfied with Libya as a host of the 
UN/AU peace process and thinks Libya has generally been helpful. 
 They conceded not all movements agree but refrained from 
comment on Libya's relationship with elements of the JEM 
leadership. 
 
NO ROLE FOR MINAWI 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  All three were emphatic that Minni Minawi has no 
place in the peace process except as a member of the GOS (they 
called it NCP) delegation.  Hussein said it would be 
"impossible" for Minawi to join the UN/AU process at this late 
stage.
