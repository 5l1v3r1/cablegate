SUBJECT: SOUTH CENTRAL: NAJAF, KARBALA SERMONS CALL FOR END TO 
POLITICAL STALEMATE, WASIT JA'AFARI SUPPORTERS RALLY 
 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY. Friday sermons in both Najaf and Karbala 
condemned ongoing sectarian violence and demanded an end to the 
political wrangling over the formation of a national government. 
 In Najaf, a high-ranking Supreme Council for the Islamic 
Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) cleric also expressed his frustration 
over the slow pace of the Saddam Hussein trial. In Karbala, a 
representative of Ayatollah Al-Sistani stressed that the 
Marja'aya would remain behind the United Iraqi Alliance slate, 
but reminded its leaders that the delay in forming a government 
was causing unnecessary pain and suffering among their 
supporters. In Wasit, at a rally to commemorate the death of 
Dawa Party founder Mohammed Sadiq Al-Sadr, a large crowd 
demonstrated their support for PM-designate Ibrahim al-Ja'afari. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
----------- 
NAJAF 
----------- 
 
¶2. (U) At the SCIRI affiliated Husinya Al-Fatima mosque in 
Najaf, senior SCIRI cleric Sadr Al Deen Al-Qubngi strongly 
condemned recent attacks on Shi'a in Najaf and Baghdad. Qubngi 
assigned responsibility for pursuing the perpetrators-in his 
opinion, Saddamists and Baathists-on Iraqi security forces. 
 
¶3. (U) Though Saddamists and Baathists may be to blame for the 
attack, asserted Qubngi, the slow pace of government formation 
talks is also at fault. The lack of a permanent government harms 
security throughout the country, according to Qubngi, noting 
that Najaf is particularly vulnerable during this tense period. 
 
--------- 
KARBALA 
-------- 
 
¶4. (U) In Karbala, a representative of Ayatollah Sistani 
castigated the politicians of the UIA for failing to reach an 
agreement on the formation of a national government. Shaykh 
Abdul Mahdi Al-Karbalee, without mentioning specific parties or 
politicians, called on "all political entities to weigh keenly 
the necessity of finding a solution for the current problematic 
situation even if it takes some to yield certain political 
positions." 
 
¶5. (U) Though critical of UIA leadership, Al-Karbalee indicated 
that the Marja'aya remained firmly behind the Shi'a Islamist 
alliance, stating "The Al-Marja'aya will support the UIA as long 
as they remain united." The UIA, according to Al-Karbalee, still 
possessed the trust of Iraq's Shi'a, but stated that a continued 
stalemate would call this trust into doubt. 
 
¶6. (U) Al-Karbalee concluded with criticism of Coalition Forces 
and perceived U.S. interference in the Iraqi government, 
demanding that the Iraqi Government "expose to the public all 
the security violations that the American forces have committed."

WASIT: PRO JA'AFARI DEMONSTRATION 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) In Al-Kut, approximately one thousand Dawa Party 
supporters gathered to commemorate the death of Dawa Party 
founder Mohammed Sadiq Al-Sadr. With representatives of all 
constituent parties of the UIA present, the gathering quickly 
became a rally in support of UIA Prime Minister-designate 
Ja'afari. Banners at the brief, peaceful rally included the 
familiar slogans,  "No, No America! No,  No,  Israel" as well as 
"Yes,  Yes Ja'afari! Yes, Yes to Islam!" 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT. Facing the twin challenges of sectarian 
violence and rising impatience with the slow pace of government 
formation, politicians and clerics in Iraq's Shi'a heartland 
reached out to their followers during Friday sermons. Keeping 
South Central voters convinced that the UIA-despite its faults 
and conflicts within its leadership-is the only true 
representative of Shi'a aspirations will be an ongoing challenge 
for the UIA leadership. Given the VBIED attacks in Najaf and 
Baghdad immediately prior, it was somewhat surprising that the 
rhetoric was not more strident. END COMMENT.
