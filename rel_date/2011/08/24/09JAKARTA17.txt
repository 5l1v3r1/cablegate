RIGHTS COOPERATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) On December 31, 2008, the Deputy Chief of Mission met with 
Abdul Bari Azed, Secretary General of the Ministry of Law and Human 
Rights.  Azed described the various justice sector bills that his 
Ministry was responsible for drafting, including the corruption and 
judicial commission bills.  He noted that with elections coming up 
in Indonesia, it would be difficult to make sure all of these bills 
passed in 2009.  Azed also raised the issue of extradition, and the 
DOJ/OPDAT Resident Legal Advisor (RLA) explained that negotiations 
regarding a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) had already begun 
and that there was already good assistance in deportation 
proceedings.  The RLA further described assistance DOJ was currently 
providing to the Ministry in the area of criminal procedure code 
drafting and mutual legal assistance. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Azed specifically identified human rights as one area he 
hoped to work more closely with the U.S. in the future.  He noted 
that, per a presidential decree, Indonesia was establishing a series 
of local task forces involving more than four hundred officials 
nationwide to combat human rights violations.  He hoped that the 
U.S. might be able to provide technical assistance in this area 
through some combination of training to the police, public outreach, 
and U.S. exchanges and short term fellowships. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Azed's request for assistance in the area of human rights 
is a welcome opportunity to continue to help Indonesia evolve into a 
democratic state that respects human rights.
