¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  May 27-28 technical committee meetings following 
the Kisangani FDLR Conference reached agreement on the process 
through which the FDLR-RUD and RPR will disarm and begin 
repatriation to Rwanda or resettlement in the DRC.  MONUC is 
guardedly optimistic regarding prospects for successful 
demobilization, based in large part on the level of commitment 
demonstrated by the GDRC.  FDLR/FOC representatives were not in 
Kisangani, although individuals claiming to represent that group 
were present.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Congolese government and FDLR factions RUD (Ralliement 
pour l'Unite et la Democratie) and RPR (Rassemblement du Peuple 
Rwandais) agreed May 28 on  modalities for disarmament and 
processing of FDLR-RUD and RPR combatants and dependents prior to 
repatriation to Rwanda or relocation in the DRC.  The May 27-28 
meeting followed the May 26 conference of FDLR factions sponsored by 
the Congolese government that produced a "Roadmap for the 
disarmament of the Rwandan armed groups in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo" (reftel). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Congolese government representatives and political and 
military leadership of FDLR-RUD and RPR worked with a technical 
committee including MONUC, the EU, South Africa, the ECC (the 
religious denomination "Eglise du Christ au Congo"), UNOCHA, World 
Bank MDRP, and UNHCR to produce the agreement.  It establishes two 
assembly points for combatants and dependents located near areas 
where FDLR-RUD and RPR are active.  It calls for the GDRC to 
identity possible relocation areas within the DRC by June 2 and the 
reporting of RUD and RPR combatants to the assembly points by June 
¶4. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) MONUC DDRRR Political Advisor Guillaume Lacaille, who 
participated in the meetings, assessed the overall prospects for 
compliance as strong.  He told us June 2 that GDRC identification of 
relocation sites is essential to maintain FDLR confidence in the 
roadmap.  He was less confident that the June 2 and June 4 timelines 
would be met.  He predicted the first combatant arrivals at the 
assembly points would not occur until June 11, and that combatants 
would remain in transit camps for at least two months.  He said that 
MONUC has funds to support the transit camps for two weeks, after 
which contributions will be solicited from donors. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Lacaille said he doubted the GDRC would produce 
information on relocation sites within Congo in the immediate 
future.  He cautioned that FDLR-RUD and RPR leadership could lose 
faith in the agreement if the GDRC delayed excessively.  RUD 
military commander Musare reportedly remains on the fence.  Lacaille 
noted the two-month stay in the transit camps presented MONUC an 
opportunity to work to separate the leadership from the rank and 
file and present repatriation options to combatants and dependents. 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Lacaille confirmed that 10 Congolese showed up at the 
Kisangani meeting claiming to represent the hardline FDLR/FOCA 
faction.  He said they were quickly identified as imposters based on 
their lack of Kinyarwanda language skills and nervous behavior. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment:  The production of a timetable and action plan in 
the wake of the Kisangani conference is a positive step, but 
progress will also depend on the availability of financial resources 
to process and relocate or repatriate combatants and their 
dependent.  Successes in demobilizing RUD combatants would 
demonstrate progress in the Nairobi process and isolate FDLR 
hardliners, adding impetus to the Goma process as well.  End 
Comment.
