CENTENNIAL 
 
REF: STATE 152640 
 
Post appreciates the opportunity to consider potential public 
diplomacy opportunities related to the anniversary of 
Theodore Roosevelt's "Great White Fleet."  Though the United 
States enjoys excellent naval cooperation with Spain today, 
and Spain has been supportive of joint efforts such as the 
Africa Partnership Station, plans for commemorating the 
1907-1909 circumnavigation (reftel) are more likely to 
generate bad feelings than good will.  Any attention drawn to 
the centenary voyage would be an unwelcome historical 
reminder of the defeat of the Spanish Caribbean fleet in 
Santiago de Cuba in July 1898 and of the Spanish Pacific 
fleet at Manila Bay earlier that year by the same fleet. 
U.S. Mission Madrid respectfully declines the invitation to 
participate in this initiative.
