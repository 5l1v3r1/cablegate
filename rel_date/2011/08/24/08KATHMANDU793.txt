Joint Demarche Delivered to Foreign Ministry 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On July 3, Emboff and Igor Gavrichev, Minister 
Counsellor from the Embassy of the Russian Federation, 
informed Rudra Nepal, Under Secretary for the UN and 
International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, that India and Jordan had become partner nations of 
the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism as per Ref 
A request.  Gavrichev also gave the Under Secretary a 
non-paper summarizing the outcome of the Fourth Meeting of 
the Global Initiative in Madrid, Spain.  Rudra Nepal said 
that lack of funds and technical expertise continued to 
prevent the Government of Nepal (GON) from forming an 
inter-ministry committee to handle Global Initiative issues 
(Ref B).  Gavrichev emphasized the importance of the program 
and how pleased the U.S. and Russia are about the GON's 
membership. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The GON continues to show minimal interest in the 
Global Initiative.  Domestic concerns -- including the 
formation of a new government, which has remained in limbo 
since the Constituent Assembly election on April 10 -- is 
likely to keep the Global Initiative a non-priority for the 
GON.  Nevertheless, post is hopeful that India's entrance as 
a partner nation might persuade Nepal to invest some energy 
in the Global Initiative in the interest of keeping up with 
its larger, powerful neighbor.
