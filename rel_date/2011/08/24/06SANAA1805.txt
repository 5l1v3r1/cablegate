On June 19, Ambassador delivered reftel demarche points 
(reftel) on the newly formed U.N. Human Rights Council, to 
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohiedeen Al-Dhibbi.  Ambassador 
emphasized that the council should begin with a more general 
and "lean" agenda concentrating on effective processes rather 
than country-specific resolutions, particularly at such an 
early phase.  Dhibbi replied that he would convey those 
concerns to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was in 
Geneva for the committee's opening.
