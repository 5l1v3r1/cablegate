¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  AN EMBASSY OFFICIAL DELIVERED THE MCC FY10 
SCORECARD FOR INDONESIA TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA (GOI) ON 
TUESDAY OCTOBER 27, 2009.  A SENIOR INDONESIAN OFFICIAL EXPRESSED 
SHOCK AT THE RATINGS AND DEEP CONCERN OVER PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS IT 
MIGHT TRIGGER.  THE OFFICIAL WORRIED THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 
RATINGS COULD DAMAGE THE U.S.-INDONESIAN RELATIONSHIP IF NOT HANDLED 
WELL.  THE GOI IS FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF EFFORTS TO OBTAIN A GRACE 
PERIOD AND APPRECIATIVE OF THE UPCOMING MCC VISIT AS A SIGN OF 
SUPPORT.  PLEASE SEE ACTION REQUEST IN PARA 6.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) THE MCC INDONESIA SCORECARD WAS DELIVERED TO DR. IR. LUKITA 
DINARSYAH TUWO, DEPUTY MINISTER FOR DEVELOPMENT FUNDING AFFAIRS IN 
THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING AGENCY (BAPPENAS) ON TUESDAY 
OCTOBER 27, 2009.  REFTEL POINTS WERE COVERED.  DR. LUKITA ACCEPTED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR FURTHER DISSEMINATION OF THE SCORECARD WITHIN THE 
GOI. 
 
¶3. (SBU) DR. LUKITA WAS CLEARLY SHOCKED BY THE RESULTS.  WHILE HE 
KNEW INDONESIA NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO MEET MCC REQUIREMENTS, HE HAD 
NOT FOCUSED ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF GRADUATING TO A HIGHER INCOME 
GROUP ON THE STANDARDS TO BE MET.  HE WAS ESPECIALLY DISTRESSED 
BECAUSE INDONESIA HAD CONTINUED TO IMPROVE ITS PERFORMANCE, HAD 
ESTABLISHED A SPECIAL UNIT TO WORK ON THE COMPACT, HAD FUNDS IN THE 
APPROVED BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR FOR COMPACT DEVELOPMENT, WAS SET TO 
PRESENT THE RESULTS OF A CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS, WAS PREPARING FOR THE 
MCC TEAM VISIT, AND WAS PLANNING A SERIES OF PUBLIC FORA TO DISCUSS 
THE CONTRAINTS ANALYSIS AND POSSIBLE PROJECTS. 
 
¶4. (SBU) HE EXPRESSED DEEP CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE INTERNAL GOI 
REACTIONS AND THOSE OF THE PUBLIC.  HE FORESAW POSSIBLE NEGATIVE 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WHEN NEWS OF THE RATINGS 
BECOMES PUBLIC.  INDONESIAN ELIGIBILITY FOR A MCC COMPACT HAD BEEN 
WIDELY DISSEMINATED AND CITED AS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN U.S. INDONESIA 
RELATIONS.  UNLESS CAREFULLY HANDLED THE NEW SCORECARD COULD DO HARM 
TO THAT RELATIONSHIP. 
 
¶5. (U) DR. LUKITA FULLY SUPPORTS MCC EFFORTS TO SEEK A LEGISLATIVE 
FIX WHICH WILL ALLOW A GRACE PERIOD FOR ADJUSTMENT.  HE ALSO 
EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE PLANNED NOVEMBER VISIT OF THE MCC 
TEAM AS A SIGN OF CONTINUED MCC SUPPORT. 
 
¶6. (U) ACTION REQUEST. VIA SEPTEL THE EMBASSY WILL PROVIDE DRAFT 
PRESS GUIDANCE FOR WASHINGTON CLEARANCE FOR USE WHEN THE RATINGS ARE 
RELEASED.
