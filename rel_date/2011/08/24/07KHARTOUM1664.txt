SUBJECT: OIL COMPANY VICE PRESIDENT CONFIRMS REBEL ATTACK 
ON DEFRA OIL FACILITY 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On October 25, the Vice President of the Greater 
Nile Petroleum Operating Company (GNPOC), Dr. Yousif Mohamed 
Ahmed, confirmed that a rebel force took two GNPOC 
contractors and two Sudanese drivers hostage on October 24. 
Ahmed was not able to confirm that the rebels were tied to 
the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), though JEM's website 
posted news stories attributing the kidnappings to them. 
According to Ahmed, Egyptian and Iraqi GNPOC contractors were 
taken captive along with two Sudanese drivers and two 
vehicles.  (Note: Newspaper reports stated that the  GNPOC 
contractors are of Iraqi and Canadian nationality.  Ahmed 
stated that the Egyptian contractor may have dual 
Egyptian-Canadian nationality.)  Ahmed stated that GNPOC 
representatives spoke to the Egyptian and Iraqi hostages 
yesterday and that they are being properly treated and are in 
good condition.  Contrary to Sudan Tribune reports, Ahmed 
reported that no Sudanese Armed Force soldiers died in the 
attack. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Ahmed noted that his company experienced a similar 
attack before Ramadan.  He stated that his company negotiated 
with rebels and eventually paid ransom for their release.  He 
said his company is reluctant to pay ransom again as it only 
encourages further kidnappings.  In his current consultations 
with the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Government of Sudan, 
Ahmed stated that he has asked SAF to refrain from violence 
in retaking the hostages and to focus on negotiations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Ahmed did not appear overly concerned about the 
kidnappings, and said "These things happen fairly frequently 
in oil producing states such as Sudan." 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  On a separate matter, Ahmed said sensationalist 
Sudanese newspaper reports such as that in "Akhir Lahza" 
about the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) incursion 
into Hegleig oil field are "totally unfounded."  He stated 
that this was just a routine SPLA troop movement, and that 
his company even supports such movements by occasionally 
providing water and food to them.
