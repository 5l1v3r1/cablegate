¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The president of the Moroccan Association of Youth 
Against AIDS (A.M.J.C.S.) shared his perspective on the political and 
economic context in which Moroccan NGOs operate.  His candid comments 
about government efforts to appear socially responsive, the 
disconnect between economic growth and improved social services, and 
the shortcomings of Morocco's politicians shed light on the overall 
situation in Morocco.  His comments also reinforce the perception 
that civil society in Morocco, more than the government or political 
parties, continues to emerge as the driving force behind substantive 
social change.  END SUMMARY 
 
------------------------- 
Appearance Versus Reality 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) When CG and Econoff met with the president of A.M.J.C.S., 
Abdessamad Oussayh, on January 17, 2007, he cited several examples to 
show that the GOM is not as responsive to social needs as it would 
like to appear.  As he aptly put it, many ministers are involved on 
paper, but the reality is different.  He said that the Ministry of 
Justice, which should develop laws to protect people, had signed a 
human rights decree, but had done nothing in practice.  Similarly, 
the Minister of Education may mention AIDS, but schools have no guide 
for sex education and the Ministry leaves NGOs such as A.M.J.C.S. to 
do the real work.  Oussayh offered yet another example, saying that 
the GOM claimed to provide free housing to 200,000 people, when in 
fact people had paid for their homes.  Although the government 
appears to address social needs, Oussayh feels that it actually does 
little for the fight against AIDS and similar causes. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In Oussayh's opinion, which he has shared publicly, 
Morocco's approach to the National Initiative for Human Development 
(INDH) is another social initiative that seems more for show than 
impact.  In an attempt to address human development issues, the King 
created a structure and put in place people that have little 
experience with human development.  Oussayh argues that it would have 
made more sense to appoint a qualified manager who would then create 
an appropriate framework after identifying key issues. 
 
------------------------------ 
WHY SOCIAL SERVICES FALL SHORT 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) In explaining why the GOM misses the mark when it comes to 
social services, Oussayh noted that the government ministers 
responsible for such programs live lavish lives that are far removed 
from the average person's on-the-ground reality.  He said a Minister 
living in a big villa with a pool has no concept of the fact that a 
family cannot be expected to survive on USD 330 per month, paying for 
food, water and electricity. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Oussayh also noted that Morocco's improving economy is not 
connected to social service needs, so that the poor continue to be 
left behind.  To illustrate his point, he noted that Morocco has an 
insufficient program for retirees.  As a result, young Moroccans who 
could benefit from the growing economy are forced to devote their 
resources entirely to their families, making it impossible to save 
for the future.  Oussayh maintains that, "you cannot develop a 
country that way," failing to link economic growth with improved 
social services. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
POLITICAL PARTIES ALSO NOT WHAT THEY SEEM 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Just as the government appears to be more responsive than it 
is, Oussayh contends that politicians in Morocco are not what they 
would seem to be either.  In fact, he says, "in Morocco, there are no 
politicians, just people who search for power."  He said that while 
the Justice and Development Party (PJD) has an ideology and does 
small things to help people, they do not respect or listen to others. 
 He is concerned about how a religious party would treat Morocco's 
citizens ten years from now, given that it would not benefit 
non-Islamic segments of the population.  In general, Oussayh lamented 
that Morocco's political parties lack innovation, keeping the same 
people in power for years instead of allowing others to bring a fresh 
perspective. 
 
-------------------- 
PROGRESS NONETHELESS-------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Despite an environment that is less supportive than it 
appears on the surface, A.M.J.C.S. is a thriving NGO with an array of 
programs targeting vulnerable groups including students, sex workers 
and working children.  The organization is run like a business, and 
volunteers receive extensive training before being commissioned to 
represent A.M.J.C.S. as trainers and educators.  The organization 
receives most of its funding from The Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria, although some also comes from UNAIDS and 
various government ministries.  On the whole, Moroccan society is 
receptive to messages about HIV/AIDS awareness, with the exception of 
some Islamists and conservatives.  Far from being negative, Oussayh 
is an upbeat man who believes strongly that the patience and 
perseverance of youth will ultimately provide solutions to Morocco's 
challenges. 
 
¶8. (SBU) COMMENT:  Oussayh's perspective on Morocco's political and 
economic reality reinforces the growing perception here that the 
force of social change rests with civil society more than the 
government or political parties.  The latter often seem remote and 
unconnected with real issues, from the perspective of many in 
Casablanca.  Oussayh's views also underscore the point that Morocco's 
successful efforts to promote economic growth need to be connected 
with bolder initiatives to improve social services in order to have 
the desired effect.  END COMMENT.
