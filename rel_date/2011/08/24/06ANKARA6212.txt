AGREEMENT 
 
REF: 2005 ANKARA 3358 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post has been actively following the progress of the 
Turkish Parliament's review of the Bi-lateral Agreement with 
Turkey Regarding Cooperation to Facilitate the Provision of 
Assistance for Preventing the Proliferation of Weapons of 
Mass Destruction.  The Agreement has been reviewed and 
endorsed by the Foreign Relations Committee and sent to the 
General Assembly for ratification.  Initial review of the 
Agreement occurred in mid-October and we are now awaiting 
final ratification.  The Agreement has been one of the top 
four agenda items since the Grand National Assembly 
reconvened in early October. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador sent separate letters to the Speaker of 
the Turkish Grand National Assembly, Bulent Arinc and 
Chairman of Foreign Relations Committee, Mehmet Dulger, on 
October 16, 2006 encouraging the ratification of this 
agreement.  Ambassador noted that ratification of this 
Agreement will strengthen our cooperation in the fight 
against terrorism and proliferation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Dulger confirmed to Political Counselor on October 
30 that Parliament is continuing to review the Agreement and 
he expects it to be ratified soon.
