SUBJECT: ANOTHER EGYPTIAN COURT RULES AGAINST MILITARY 
TRIBUNALS FOR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD 
 
REF: A. CAIRO 1361 
     ¶B. CAIRO 2683 
 
Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for internet distribution. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Following on three previous rulings by other courts, 
another Egyptian civil court has ruled against the GOE's use 
of military tribunals against the Muslim Brotherhood (MB). 
On September 10, the Cairo Court of Summary Jurisdiction 
reportedly rejected the Egyptian government's appeal of a May 
8 court ruling that had overturned the February presidential 
decree ordering 40 MB members to stand before a military 
tribunal.  The court's ruling upheld the Supreme 
Administrative Court's May decision in favor of the MB's 
position (ref A), and ruled that the 40 defendants should be 
tried before a civilian court, rather than military 
tribunals. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The MB military tribunals began on April 26, and 
have continued sporadically since then.  The charges against 
the 40 MB members (only 33 of whom are in custody; the other 
seven are being tried in abstentia) reportedly include money 
laundering and planning terrorist actions in support of the 
MB.  The MB members in custody include several senior members 
of the group, including the MB's third highest-ranking 
official, Second Deputy Supreme Guide Khairat Al Shatir.  The 
September 10 ruling was the fourth civil court decision 
against the government regarding the MB military trials, 
spurred by a flurry of lawsuits the MB has filed disputing 
the legality of the presidential decree mandating military 
tribunals.  The other rulings were: 
 
- On January 29, the Cairo Criminal Court dismissed all 
charges against 16 of the defendants (including Khairat al 
Shatir); 
 
- On April 24, the North Cairo Felonies Court ruled that 11 
of the defendants be released (including al Shatir); 
 
- On May 8, the Supreme Administrative Court overturned the 
presidential decree sending the MB members to military 
trials, ruled that all the detainees be released immediately, 
and be compensated for their time in detention. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As of September 17, the MB detainees reportedly are 
still in detention, and there is no expectation that they 
will be released.  The GOE will undoubtedly appeal the 
September 10 ruling, and in the interim, the military 
tribunals will continue.
