Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On December 4, Enfidha Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali 
Airport is set to receive its inaugural flight.  Constructed 
in only 24 months, the airport is located 100 kms south of 
Tunis and is significantly larger than Tunis-Carthage 
International Airport.  The first of four terminals has a 
capacity of seven million passengers.  The entire project, to 
be completed in phases by 2036, is set to accommodate 25 
million passengers per year and will be the largest airport 
in North Africa.  Enfidha Ben Ali Airport was built by the 
Turkish company TAV and partially financed by the African 
Development Bank.  TAV will operate it on a 40-year 
concession.  Valued at 550 million euros, this is the largest 
single foreign investment in Tunisia.  Designed mostly for 
charter flights bringing European tourists to package resorts 
in the area, the airport will absorb traffic phased out from 
nearby Monastir airport and will eventually open to regularly 
scheduled commercial flights.  The question remains, however, 
whether there will be sufficient demand to meet an airport of 
such a scale.  End summary.

An International Airport in 24 Months 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The inaugural flight of Tunisia's Enfidha Zine 
El-Abidine Ben Ali Airport is set to arrive from Europe on 
December 4.  The airport, whose construction took only 24 
months, is situated 100 kms south of Tunis and 40 kms in 
either direction from the tourist cities of Hammamet and 
Sousse.  It is next to the main highway, a north-south 
railroad, and near the site of a deepwater port set to begin 
construction in 2013 (the tender has not yet been issued). 
Econoff visited the Enfidha airport as part of a delegation 
from a conference organized by the African Development Bank. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The new airport boasts 62 check-in counters, 18 
passenger boarding bridges, eight baggage claim carousels, a 
presidential wing, and a two-mile runway capable of 
accommodating the Airbus 380.  With a capacity of seven 
million passengers annually, Enfidha Ben Ali is far larger 
than the Tunis-Carthage International Airport, which has a 
five million passenger capacity.  The airport has underground 
fuel tanks and draws energy from a co-generation plant on 
premises.  It was built in record time thanks to twenty-four 
hour shifts and over 50 different contractors from France, 
Finland, Italy, Spain, Turkey and Egypt.  Only one of four 
terminals is built -- the other three will be built in stages 
with completion of the entire project (including an 
additional runway) slated for 2036.  The control tower, which 
is nearly 300 feet high, will service all four terminals and 
is currently operating the nearby airport of Monastir 
remotely.  When finished, Enfidha Ben Ali Airport will be the 
largest airport in the Maghreb. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Turkish company TAV developed the project with a 
40-year build-operate-transport concession, with most 
revenues returning to TAV but some to the GOT.  According to 
airport officials, the Tunisian government only provided 
road, electricity, sewage and telecom infrastructure and no 
actual funds for the project.  When announced in 2007, the 
price tag was set at 400 million euros, but the final cost 
ended up being 550 million euros, making it the largest 
single foreign investment in Tunisia.  The African 
Development Bank financed 70 million euros of the project. 
Even so, TAV Tunisie, TAV's local subsidiary, was forced to 
sell shares in early 2009 to come up with additional capital 
in the face of the global credit crunch. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Will there be enough passenger traffic? 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) The current capacity of the terminal is seven 
million passengers -- enough, according to airport officials, 
to capture the current 4.5 million charter flight passengers 
that are flying into Monastir airport (40 minute drive south 
of Enfidha).  Monastir airport reached capacity in 2005 and 
has been saturated since.  According to officials, flights 
will be diverted from Monastir to Enfidha as soon as it is 
fully operational.  When the four terminals are built, the 
airport will have a capacity of over 25 million passengers 
annually and will be poised to serve as a regional air hub. 
TAV officials said 15 percent of traffic will be commercial, 
starting with Turkish Air and Egypt Air flights.  Diet 
Enfidha, an Italian company that owns land for industrial 
parks near the airport, has plans for a hotel/tourism complex 
based on expected demand.  However, due to the distance 
between the capital and Enfidha, it is unlikely the airport 
will replace Tunis-Carthage International Airport in the near 
or mid-term.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Enfidha Ben Ali Airport's installations and 
short construction time are impressive and speak to the 
government's full support of the initiative.  Since its 
inception, this has been a presidential priority; the 
President was present at its inception and warmly welcomed a 
foreign investment of such magnitude.  It is not clear, 
however, whether a major ceremony will be held for the first 
charter flight.  The big question remains whether the 
ambitious plans of 25 million passengers a year will bear 
fruit, as charter flights alone are unlikely to rise so 
precipitously even if the tourism industry expands.  Its 
distance from the capital and other major economic centers 
could mean Enfidha's modern transit lounges remain largely 
empty.
