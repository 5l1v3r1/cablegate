¶1.  (SBU) MFA Director for Bilateral Affairs Dr. Dhafer Al 
Umran, who will represent Bahrain at the Sanaa Forum for the 
Future preparatory meeting during the week of June 3, told 
Pol/Econ Chief May 30 that he plans to criticize G8 
countries, with the exception of the U.S. and UK, for their 
lack of support for the Center for Entrepreneurial Excellence 
in Bahrain (CEEB).  He emphasized that Bahrain had agreed to 
host the CEEB at the request of G8 countries at the Sea 
Island Summit in 2004 and the first Forum for the Future 
meeting later that year in Morocco.  Unfortunately, the only 
G8 countries to step in with support were the U.S. and UK. 
(The GOB gives in-kind assistance by providing office space, 
administrative support, and linkages with other 
entrepreneurship-based programs in Bahrain.)  As a result of 
the lack of funding, the Center plans to halt its operations 
at the end of June. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Al Umran said he has prodded G8 representatives to 
support the CEEB on many occasions, including international 
meetings in Sharm Al Sheikh, Singapore, Jordan, and Moscow 
over the past twelve months, but always comes up empty.  At 
the Sanaa session, he will say that Bahrain is inclined to 
oppose any proposed new BMENA initiatives because the G8 is 
unable to support those already under way.  Without support 
for concrete programs like the CEEB, the Forum process 
becomes "just a lot of hot air," he said.  He noted that the 
MFA, and he in particular, have come under attack locally for 
the CEEB's planned closure.  The situation has "provided 
ammunition" to those who oppose G8-BMENA relations, and the 
closure represents a blow to political relations between the 
G8 and the countries of the region. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Al Umran asked that the USG representative to the 
Sanaa meeting voice support for G8 funding for the CEEB, 
following his intervention.  He said he would make a similar 
request of the British government.
