BARGAIN

1.Summary.  Militia Colonel Aleksandr Astafyev, who was arrested 
on trumped up charges in June in an attempt by some local 
authorities to neutralize his anti-corruption campaign, may be 
ready to make a plea bargain.   Investigators reportedly have 
still been unable to assemble adequate evidence and have offered 
a conditional sentence if he admits guilt.  Evidence or not, he 
remains in jail and evidently has been pressured enough.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. Astafyev continues to languish in a local jail (see Ref A). 
We understand that investigators still have been unable to 
obtain credible evidence to prove their accusations that he was 
involved in fraudulent activity or any other violations of his 
duties.  Instead, they have offered a conditional sentence if 
Astafyev pleads guilty. 
 
¶3. The Director of Far Eastern State University's Organized 
Crime Study Center, Vitaliy Nomokonov, told us on December 2 
that Astafyev`s son had recently asked for his advice about 
whether Astafyev should  accept the prosecutor's plea bargain. 
Nomokonov had advised Astafyev not accept the offer because the 
investigation has nothing against him and is only seeking ways 
to justify the arrest. 
 
¶4. Nevertheless,  Nomokonov added,  investigators have pressured 
Astafyev enough, and he is ready to accept the bargain in order 
to leave the pre-detention center until the court hearings. 
Nomokonov pointed out that this means that Astafyev will 
definitely be sentenced, receiving probably a conditional 
sentence. 
 
¶5. Comment.  Astafyev is a close Consulate contact who 
participated in a State Department-sponsored International 
Visitors Program devoted to fighting corruption.  He has been a 
well known speaker at seminars organized by the Far Eastern 
National University's Organized Crime Study Center (OCSC) and 
had received a grant from the OCSC to write about violent 
corporate takeovers in Primorye. 
 
¶6. Earlier, Astafyev passed a note to the U.S. Consulate 
requesting American assistance (see Ref B). His spouse has told 
us that he would like to move to the U.S. as refugee when his 
case is over.  End Comment.
