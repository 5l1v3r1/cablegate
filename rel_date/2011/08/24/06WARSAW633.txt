¶1.  (U)  Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for internet

¶2.  (SBU)  Econoff discussed USG concerns about Aarhus 
Convention guidelines on public participation in 
international fora with Anna Grupinska, Director of the 
Department of the United Nations System and Global Affairs of 
the Polish Foreign Ministry.  Ms. Grupinska is newly returned 
to the MFA and was unaware of the Geneva meeting and the 
discussion of the guidelines.  However, she promised to look 
into our questions and instruct the Polish delegation to 
respond appropriately.  Ms. Grupinska noted that as a 
democratic country, Poland supports ngo participation in 
international fora, but she was very sympathetic to U.S. 
concerns about legal responsibility and finances.  Post 
believes that Poland is likely to be sympathetic to U.S. 
concerns on this issue and work with the USG to address our 
concerns.
