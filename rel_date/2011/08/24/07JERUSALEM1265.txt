SUBJECT: HANIYAH "APPOINTS" NEW PASF COMMANDERS, CO-OPTS 
EXISTING SECURITY ORGANIZATIONS 
 
¶1.   (SBU) According to PASF contacts and Arabic-language 
press, former Prime Minister Ismayil Haniyah (Hamas) has 
issued orders dismissing several Palestinian security forces 
(PASF) commanders (most of whom are no longer in Gaza), 
including Director-General for Internal Security Rashid Abu 
Shbak, police chief Kamal al-Shaykh, and Gaza,s National 
Security Forces (NSF) commanders.  While these orders have no 
legal validity, Hamas has effectively duplicated PASF 
structures in Gaza, co-opting the names, organizations and 
many officers of the PASF for a security apparatus recast 
under Hamas control.  Palestinian newspapers also report that 
Haniyah issued instructions to countermand police chief 
al-Shaykh,s June 15 orders that all police in Gaza stay home 
and refuse to obey Haniyah,s instructions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) PASF contacts and Palestinian press report that 
from June 16-18, Haniyah appointed retired PASF generals 
Tawfiq Jabr, Khader Abbas, and Hasan al-Ajrami as members of 
a council of security officers to oversee and strengthen the 
police, Preventive Security (PSO) and civil defense forces. 
He also appointed Sa,id Fanunah to overhaul and rebuild the 
Gaza NSF.  (Note:  Fanunah, a retired NSF officer, had been 
appointed as head of the planned Hamas-Fatah &Joint Security 
Force8 by President Abbas in early June, but the force never 
materialized.  End note).  Security contacts say Hamas will 
not reconstitute the Presidential Guard (PG) in Gaza and has 
not announced any plans regarding the General Intelligence 
(Mukhabarat).
