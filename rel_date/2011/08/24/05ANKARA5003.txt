Southeastern Turks Want Economic, Social Incentives: 
Turkish Prime Ministry sources told "Cumhuriyet" that the AK 
Party government did not have a special action plan for the 
southeast, stressing that initiatives to resolve the 
problems in the region had been continuing for 2.5 years. 
Businessmen from southeast Turkey demanded a detailed 
package of economic measures, the paper says, asking the 
government to issue a package of economic measures as well 
as social, cultural and educational ones.  The head of the 
Diyarbakyr Trade Chamber, Fahrettin Akyil said that 
Diyarbakyr people had been encouraged by the visit of the PM 
to the mainly Kurdish province, but that they saw no results 
thus far.  `People will not join terrorists in the mountains 
if their economic problems are resolved,' Akyil said.
