but Coming with International Support 
 
REF:  Khartoum 02203 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS) continues 
to demonstrate a lack of urgency, coordination, and capacity in 
dealing with the Juba avian influence (AI) H5N1 outbreak in poultry. 
 One AI task force meeting has been held, led by the Ministry of 
Animal Resources and Fisheries (MARF), and another meeting is 
scheduled for a week later.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) has yet to 
take a lead role in addressing potential human health risks.  There 
is no evidence of any human infections, but no human surveillance is 
in place.  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and 
USAID in-country resources are coordinating with MARF and MOH on 
community surveys on the extent of the outbreak and a public 
information campaign. Additional USG assistance is expected this 
week.  FAO has been weak in coordinating with GOSS, other UN 
entities and international donors.  End summary.

GoSS Avian Flu Task Force Meeting Held, Finally 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The long awaited GoSS AI task force meeting was held 
September 15 with no substantial participation at ministerial or 
under secretary level by MARF or MOH.  Both MARF and MOH under 
secretaries attended briefly and left before discussion of an action 
 
SIPDIS 
plan.  MOH has yet to dedicate any staff to the AI task force.  Key 
AI task force participants included: 
 
-- Dr. Agol Malak Kwal (chair), MARF director general; 
 
-- Dr. Lul Riek, acting focal point for MOH (he is in Southern Sudan 
on a USAID-funded diaspora return program to address HIV/AIDS 
issues); 
 
-- Dr. M. Yongolo, FAO (a consultant); 
 
-- Dr. Thomas Boo, CDC, Nairobi rep.; 
 
-- USG, European Joint Donor Office and EU agriculture reps; 
 
-- UNICEF health officer; and 
 
-- WHO and UN OCHA (brief attendance by both at staff level) 
 
¶3. (SBU) The task force succeeded in establishing some interagency 
cooperation among the participants, but no central incident command 
structure was established.  MARF DG agreed to the concept of a 
coordinated command center, and USG participants expressed 
willingness to help with implementation, including identifying work 
space and communications equipment.

GoSS to Ban Bird Movement, Cull Poultry, Surveil 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4. (SBU) MARF reported plans to ban movement of birds from Juba, 
depopulate Juba town poultry, and initiate surveillance.  MARF also 
announced proposed plans to begin culling with compensation, but no 
decision has been made yet on such actions. (Note:  CDC doubts the 
immediate feasibility of depopulation and a movement ban due to lack 
of any functional mechanism.  End note.) 
 
¶5. (SBU) FAO has begun to lead an effort to obtain additional lab 
specimens.  On September 17, state MOH officials and Drs. Mugo Muita 
and Diane Gross undertook a pilot household survey of about 60 homes 
to collect data on the frequency of backyard poultry keeping, as 
well as recent animal and human illnesses.  While the full survey 
data is being compiled, preliminary assessments reveal some bird 
deaths over the last few months, although causes are uncertain, and 
there have been no related human illnesses so far identified.  MARF 
is open to additional USG assistance and CDC and USAID reps are 
assessing technical, logistical, and material support needs. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Public Information Campaign Commences 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Public information is a key area of concern, which CDC and 
GoSS officials are attempting to address. In the short term, GoSS AI 
task force has approved short radio public announcements in both 
English and Juba Arabic and loudspeaker dissemination in Juba town 
warning of the disease in poultry and directing the public to report 
and dispose properly of any suspected animals.  There is no 
corresponding human illness information campaign, nor any 
coordination with health workers.  We anticipate that USAID and 
UNICEF will begin to increase efforts to address this gap shortly. 
A USAID-funded AI communications expert is expected to arrive in 
Juba on September 18-19 to facilitate a more coordinated public 
information campaign with the GOSS, UN and other members of 
international community.

¶7. (SBU) CG Juba will raise the issue with senior GOSS officials 
during calls to be made the week of September 18 to press for rapid 
response, dedicated MARF and MOH staff, and identification of needs 
for coordinated international assistance.  USAID will be sending Dr. 
Martin Swaka, a health specialist in Khartoum, to serve as the point 
of contact for ConGen assistance and coordination with GOSS on AI 
response.
