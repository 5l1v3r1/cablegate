¶3. Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
-------------------- 
 
"Deadly US Mistakes" 
 
-------------------- 
 
Isam Dari, a columnist in government-owned Tishreen, wrote 
(4/6): "The US is implementing Israel's policy toward Arab 
issues instead of having its own independent policy.... 
 
"Therefore, it is useless to imagine that the United States is 
willing to bring about a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region.... Moreover, the United States bases its policy on the 
assumption that the region's countries are hostile to Israel and 
that it has to pressure these countries.... 
 
"We wonder how US Secretary of State Rice shamelessly 
acknowledges that her country has committed thousands of 
mistakes but does not apologize to the Iraqi people. 
 
"The Bush administration is making thousands and even millions 
of mistakes in Palestine, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and other 
countries....  Bush also protects Israeli terrorism against the 
Palestinian people.... The nations of the world will hold the 
United States accountable for its mistakes sooner or later." 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
"Occupation of Iraq, Failure and Absence of Horizons" 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
Ali Rahhal, a columnist in government-owned Al-Ba'th, wrote 
(4/6): "Research and studies that have been published on the 
Iraq war, indicate that the invasion of Iraq under false 
justifications was a grave mistake by the Bush 
administration.... 
 
"The Iraq war has destroyed Iraq and its people and reflected 
negatively on US interests.  Nevertheless the US Administration 
goes ahead with its mistakes, despite the increasing US losses 
and the American people's rejection of the war.... The US 
Administration is trying to impose its vision even though it is 
wrong.... Studies indicate that the current crisis in Iraq has 
not resulted from operations by terrorists or the resistance, 
but from the occupation's mistakes and the misconduct of the US 
Army...." 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
"Occupation is Behind Increasing Sedition in Iraq" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
Na'im Muhammad Qaddah, former Ambassador, comments in Al-Thawrah 
(4/6): "It is the US-made sectarian climate that has ignited the 
fire in Iraq.... Agents of US occupation bombed the holy shrine 
in the northern Iraqi city of Samarra, which was under the 
control of the US Army at the time of the bombing. 
 
"Observers warn that certain circles in the United States are 
now calling for partitioning Iraq along ethnic and sectarian 
lines.... The atmosphere created by the US occupation has 
encouraged foreign intelligence services, such as Mosad, to 
interfere in Iraqi affairs. 
 
"The bombing of the tombs of two imams in the city of Samarra is 
part of the US divide and rule policy.... The United States is 
seeking to trigger sectarian strife among Iraqi Arabs, who form 
about 80 percent of the Iraqi people and are known for their 
adherence to their Arab and Islamic heritage." 
 
------------------------------------ 
 
"Recent Elections Were Not Decisive" 
 
------------------------------------ 
 
Ghassan Muhammad, a columnist in government-owned Al-Ba'th, 
wrote (4/6): "Israeli media organs have cast doubt on Ehud 
Olmert's plan to carry out a unilateral withdrawal from the West 
Bank....  Qadima has announced the plan in order to distinguish 
itself from the Labor Party and the Likud Party by pretending to 
accept a limited unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank.... 
The Labor Party is ready to accept such a plan through 
negotiations with Palestinians, while the Likud Party completely 
rejects the idea of withdrawal and insists on total control of 
the Palestinian territories.... 
 
"This does not mean there is a difference between this or that 
Israeli party over withdrawal, which is used by Israeli parties 
as a political maneuver.... 
 
"The idea of unilateral withdrawal was intended to win votes 
during the Israeli parliamentary elections....  Although Olmert 
believes that the occupation of Palestinian territories in 1967 
was a mistake, he has no courage to translate his belief into 
action...."
