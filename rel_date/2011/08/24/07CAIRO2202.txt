SUBJECT: IRAQI CENTRAL BANKERS RECEIVE TRAINING IN CAIRO 
 
 
¶1. (U) During the week of July 15-20 the IMF is providing training 
to 25 officials from the Iraqi Central Bank at the offices of the 
Egyptian Banking Institute (EBI), the Central Bank of Egypt's 
primary banking training facility.  The training is part of the IMF 
response to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546 which asked that 
"international financial institutions strengthen their efforts to 
assist the people of Iraq in the reconstruction and development of 
the Iraqi economy, including by providing international experts" 
(article 20).  The IMF teamed up with the U.S. Federal Reserve Board 
to present this workshop which focused on banking supervision 
issues.  U.S. Treasury advisors also participated.  Iraqi Central 
Bank Deputy Governor Ahmad Mohamad Al-Juboory was the senior-most 
Iraqi to attend.  The IMF has organized two to three of these 
workshops per year since 2004, all of which have been outside Iraq; 
this is the first to be held in Cairo.  Attendees and presenters 
noted that the session went well.  We understand the next workshops 
are scheduled for November 2007 and spring 2008, with locations yet 
to be determined. 
 
¶2. (U) Comment:  The willingness of the GOE to host this training 
for Iraqi officials is an indication of Egypt's commitment to 
helping rebuild Iraq.  The cooperative efforts of the U.S. Federal 
Reserve Board, the IMF and the GOE in providing this training could 
serve as a model for other cooperative efforts among international 
institutions and governments in addressing key issues in Iraq's 
recovery.
