Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Coverage of Israeli Prime Minister Olmert's visit to Washington 
dominates all front pages.  Reports focus on comments from the June 
3 White House daily briefing that, "Bush is not worried about the 
future of Olmert."  Al-Ayyam leads with, "Bush rewarded his visitor 
Olmert with a 'security package' of a sort that America has never 
before given to any state."  Related coverage in the dailies 
highlights that Secretary Rice "is pushing" for a peace agreement as 
Olmert begins his visit to Washington.  Papers also note Rice's June 
3 remarks to AIPAC, especially her assurance that the goal of 
reaching an agreement on a Palestinian state," will endure beyond 
the current U.S. leadership."  Coverage downplays possible positive 
outcomes of the visit, focusing instead on the impact of Olmert's 
"scandal" which is seen as diminishing his political decision-making 
power. 
 
The dailies report that Israeli Premier Olmert has approved the 
building of "884 new houses in settlements" in the Jerusalem area. 
Related coverage again highlights official Palestinian condemnation 
through PLO statements. 
 
Al-Quds reports that the Israeli High Court has criticized Israeli 
policies that were preventing Fulbright Gaza students from traveling 
abroad for university studies.  The daily reports that the Court has 
given the Israeli Government two weeks to "revise its policies." 
 
Positive coverage appears in the dailies about the imminent start of 
a new security "campaign" by Palestinian security forces in several 
cities in the northern West Bank, including Alfara'a, Tulkarim, 
Aqaba, Tamun, and Tubas. 
 
A inside page photo of U.S. Consul General Walles and Palestinian 
President Abbas introduces an Al Quds' report about the two 
officials' June 3 meeting in Ramallah.  The article inaccurately 
reports that Abbas handed Walles a letter for President Bush.  Abbas 
and Walles discussed  "latest developments" and the results of 
Abbas' meeting with Israeli Premier Olmert, according to the 
article.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
¶1.  Independent daily Al-Ayyam runs an op-ed by veteran columnist 
Hani Habib, entitled "Routine or rescue?" (6/04): "As always, when 
[Palestinian] President Abbas meets with [Israeli Premier] Olmert, 
we hear, read and see comments, criticism and repeated statements 
that contain nothing new...  Endless, useless meetings... these 
talks have become routine and are a mechanism that is allowed to 
continue only because both sides have no alternative.  Both sides 
are biding their time, waiting for a miracle at a time when miracles 
no longer exist..." 
 
¶2. Independent daily Al-Ayyam runs an op-ed by columnist, Majed 
Kayali entitled, "The legitimacy of a new Palestinian political 
vision" (6/03): "... a group of activists and intellectuals in 
Palestinian society have found answers to many questions in 
suggesting a, "project for a new political vision," based on what 
has been accomplished by Palestinian national movements... this new 
vision focuses on three dimensions that are related to the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict:  The first is related to the national 
 
JERUSALEM 00000938  002 OF 002 
 
 
goal of a two-state solution.  After being adopted 34 years ago, it 
is no longer a practical solution, given Israeli policies on the 
ground... the second is a call to return to a one-state solution 
with a secular and democratic state... this call gains its 
credibility from the failure of 'an independent state solution,' in 
light of developments on the ground."
