DELIVERED 
 
REF: 08 STATE 132539 
 
(SBU) We confirmed that the Dutch ambassador to Turkey 
informed the MFA on December 19 of the Netherlands' plan to 
host the fifth round of the Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism in June 2009 at the Hague.  We delivered 
reftel demarche on December 23 to MFA Nonproliferation and 
Disarmament Department Head Elif Ulgen, who congratulated the 
Dutch, but stated Turkey's intention not to participate in 
the meeting at a senior level due to its concerns about 
Cypriot participation in the initiative.  Turkey will likely 
send a representative from its embassy at The Hague.  Ulgen 
said a similar message was provided to the Dutch ambassador. 
The Russian Embassy had received instructions to deliver the 
demarche, but has not done so as of January 15.
