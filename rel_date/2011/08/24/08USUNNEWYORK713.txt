SUBJECT: SOMALI PERMREP'S RESIDENCE: OBTAINING TFG APPROVAL 
FOR LIMITED WAIVER OF INVIOLABILITY 
 
REF: SECSTATE 82138 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. Action request - See Paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. During U.S. Deputy Permrep Wolff's meeting August 7 to 
discuss political developments (septel) with Somali UN 
Mission Deputy Permrep Idd Beddel Mohamed, Ambassador Wolff 
raised the long-standing problem of serious health and safety 
hazards at the unoccupied residence in New Rochelle, New 
York, owned by Somalia's UN Mission (reftels). USUN delivered 
a diplomatic note on August 1, 2008, requesting that Somalia 
execute a limited waiver of inviolability to enable New 
Rochelle officials to enter the premises and remedy the 
property's health and safety hazards. The diplomatic note 
also conveyed that, in the absence of a waiver, the 
Department would revisit the diplomatic status of the 
property, including its inviolability and exemption from 
property taxes. Somalia's Mohamed, after mentioning his 
country's chronic lack of funds and that his Mission had 
considered selling the residence, indicated that he hoped to 
have a favorable reply from the TFG by August 15 regarding 
the waiver. Mohamed also recommended that Ambassador Yates 
weigh in with the TFG on the importance of this issue to 
maximize the likelihood that the TFG will approve the waiver 
expeditiously. 
 
¶3. Action request - We request that Department ask Ambassador 
Yates to raise the importance of this matter with the TFG and 
the need to approve the waiver expeditiously.
