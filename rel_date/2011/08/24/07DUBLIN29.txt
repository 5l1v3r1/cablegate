¶1.  (U) POLOFF spoke with Stephen Dawson, Deputy Regional 
Director, Middle East and North Africa Division, Department 
of Foreign Affairs, on January 11. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ireland maintains a two-officer mission in Iran led 
by Ambassador John Deady.  Dawson indicated that while 
Ireland supports democratic reform in Iran, Ambassador Deany 
has very little money for public diplomacy initiatives. 
Dawson said that no NGOs were receiving Irish Government 
funding for activities in Iran.  He was not aware of any 
Irish NGOs operating in Iran independently. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Dawson said he would pass our reftel demarche to 
Ambassador Deady and suggested that the Ambassador would be 
interested in liaising with bilateral and NGO partners to 
promote democracy in Iran.
