EconOff delivered reftel demarche to Ministry of Justice 
Director for EU and International Organization Affairs, 
Francisco Alvarez, on 12/5/07.  Alvarez contacted EconOff on 
12/07/07 with a preliminary GOS reaction.  Alvarez said that, 
in principle, Spain shared the USG view that existing 
procedural rules should be clarified.  Specifically with 
respect to how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) could or 
should contribute to UNCITRAL work, Spain was, however, still 
considering its position.
