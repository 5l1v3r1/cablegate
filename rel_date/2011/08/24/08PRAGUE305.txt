¶1. (SBU) As noted in our May 5 update (ref B), the Czech 
government and several Czech NGOs promote human rights in 
Cuba throughout the year.  This month Embassy Prague and the 
Czechs have engaged on several fronts.  The Embassy has 
scheduled and publicized a showing and discussion of the film 
"Damas de Blanco" in cooperation with the well-respected 
Czech NGO People in Need (PIN), for the evening of May 20 and 
the largest Czech daily newspaper, "Mlada Fronta Dnes," will 
publish on May 21 an op-ed piece produced by post, under the 
Ambassador's name, regarding the "Day of Solidarity with the 
Cuban People." This piece will appear also on Embassy 
Prague's public website at http://prague.usembassy.gov.  As a 
final note, the well-respected Czech NGO People in Need (PIN) 
published its quarterly journal "Cuba-Europe Dialogue" on May 
12 (ref C), which includes its policy paper on the EU "common 
position" on Cuba.
