SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) At a diplomatic briefing on January 24 attended by 
the Ambassador, MDC president Morgan Tsvangirai said that 
March elections were logistically impossible, and had already 
been sufficiently rigged to assure a ZANU-PF victory. 
Tsvangirai said the two MDC factions had agreed in principle

to form an electoral coalition; this, along with a decision 
as to whether or not to contest the elections, would be 
announced next week.  Tsvangirai also discussed his arrest 
yesterday and the aborted march.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At a diplomatic briefing on January 24 attended by 
the Ambassador, MDC president Morgan Tsvangirai confirmed 
(Reftel) that the two MDC factions had agreed in principle to 
work as an electoral coalition.  Details were being worked 
out and he expected a public announcement at the end of next 
week.  Tsvangirai also said a decision on whether or not to 
boycott the upcoming elections would be reached at about the 
same time. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On the issue of elections, Tsvangirai averred that 
Zimbabwe did not have the administrative capacity to hold 
elections by the end of March.  Further, it would be 
extremely difficult for ZANU-PF and the MDC to select and 
field candidates in over 200 parliamentary constituencies and 
for over 2000 local offices.  The delimitation report had 
just been finalized; the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission did 
not yet have a copy.  Tsvangirai concluded it would be 
"absurd" to kick start an election two weeks from now when a 
date was expected to be set. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Regardless of whether the MDC participated in the 
elections, Tsvangirai told diplomats that the election had 
already been rigged and the outcome predetermined.  As an 
example, he pointed out that there are over one million 
potential new voters who have turned 18 in the last several 
years who authorities were not permitting to register. 
Without a postponement of elections to allow a new 
constitution and reforms to take hold, a free and fair 
election was impossible. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Tsvangirai said the SADC process was virtually 
over.  At the outset, South African president Mbeki and SADC 
had assured the MDC that the process would lead to acceptable 
elections.  The MDC had made concessions, including on 
Amendment 18, in a spirit of compromise.  But Zimbabwean 
president Mugabe was intransigent, and SADC had no capacity 
to take a position against Mugabe if he remained so. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Tsvangirai said the MDC would continue to 
demonstrate and march in an effort to mobilize its 
supporters, but it was struggling without resources.  He 
urged the international community to determine how it could 
support the democratic movement in Zimbabwe. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Finally, Tsvangirai confirmed the details of his 
arrest and the march as reported reftel.  Yesterday morning, 
at about 4:00 a.m., he was asked to drive himself to a police 
station.  He was detained for four hours and asked for 
assurances that the planned march would be peaceful.  He was 
not mistreated. 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  The MDC had followed the appropriate legal process 
by notifying police of the march and had received permission 
for it to take place.  When permission was rescinded, the MDC 
 
HARARE 00000070  002 OF 002 
 
 
had appealed to a magistrate.  The magistrate had ordered 
that MDC supporters be allowed to move from MDC headquarters 
to the rally site.  When they did so, police used tear gas 
and beat several individuals.  Two or three people were 
temporarily hospitalized and several were arrested and 
released.
