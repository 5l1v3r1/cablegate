SUBJECT: MISSILE DEFENSE: WHAT THE LOCALS WANT 
 
¶1. Paragraph 3 contains the text of a petition presented to Polish 
Prime Minister Donald Tusk by the inhabitants of Redzikowo, the 
small town near Slupsk where a U.S. missile interceptor site (part 
of the "anti-missile shield) is to be located.  Tusk received the 
petition during his visit to Slupsk on August 29.  It provides some 
insight into the community's immediate concerns. 
 
¶2.  COMMENT: Per the Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement, the USG 
must present analysis of land and airspace restrictions around the 
Redzikowo interceptor site to the Polish government no later than 
November 19.  In this regard, early USG answers to the land use 
questions raised in the petition (i.e., status of the Garrison Club, 
the direct road from Redzikowo to Jezierzyce, the garden plots and 
garages, and the airplane monuments) will assist both Prime Minister 
Tusk and our own public outreach to the greater Slupsk area.  END 
COMMENT.

Redzikowo, August 29, 2008. 
 
Petition of the residents of Redzikowo, in Slupsk county 
 
To:  Donald Tusk, Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland 
 
Dear Mr. Prime Minister: 
 
In connection with the decision to build in Redzikowo, in Slupsk 
county, elements of the American anti-missile shield, we the 
citizens of Redzikowo demand a guarantee of the  safety of our 
families. 
 
We come to you with an appeal to take action to compensate us for 
losses resulting from building the American anti-missile base on our 
terrain. 
 
Also, we would like to ask you to help to solve our local problems, 
such as: 
 
¶1.  Building and modernizing technical infrastructure in Redzikowo 
(water and sewage systems, roads, sidewalks, heating), and turning 
over ownership of such infrastructure to Slupsk county. 
 
¶2.  Providing financial support to Redzikowo's local government in 
completing planned investments (building a swimming pool, planned 
construction of an ice rink). 
 
¶3.  Constructing a community center in Redzikowo, where cultural and 
educational programs could be held (in case of loss of the Garrison 
Club). 
 
¶4.  Building a direct road between the villages of Redzikowo and 
Jezierzyce, to ease access between two sport centers: a swimming 
pool and ice skating rink in Redzikowo and a stadium in Jezierzyce. 
 
¶5.  Providing financial support to insulate apartment buildings in 
the neighborhoods of Redzikowo-Osiedle and Redzikowo-SHR. 
 
¶6.  Granting ownership to the inhabitants of Redzikowo of garden 
plots and garages used and built by the inhabitants (but which are 
currently owned by the Military Property Agency). 
 
¶7.  Renovating and relocating airplane monuments, currently located 
on the military base in Redzikowo, to a new location to be agreed 
upon by the local community. 
 
Mr. Prime Minister, we would like to believe that you will fulfill 
our requests in the matter of improving the quality of life of 
residents of Redzikowo, which will allow a decrease in the negative 
effects connected with elements of the anti-rocket shield in 
proximity to our homes. 
 
End text of petition.
