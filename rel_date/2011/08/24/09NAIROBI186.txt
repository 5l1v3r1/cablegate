SUBJECT: SOMALIA - MOGADISHU HORNAFRIK DIRECTOR KILLED 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  In what appears to have been a targeted 
assassination, the Director of HornAfrik in Mogadishu was 
reportedly killed on February 4 by armed militia, possibly 
associated with al-Shabaab.  Sources indicate the journalist, 
Said Tahlil Ahmed, was part of a group summoned to a meeting 
by an al-Shabaab operative to discuss the media's positive 
reporting on developments in Somalia.  Upon arriving at the 
meeting location, the group was reportedly fired on by a 
militia.  Ahmed was killed and the other journalists fled the 
scene.  This is the second murder of a Somali journalist this 
year, following the New Year's Day death of a Shabelle 
journalist in Mogadishu.  End Summary. 
 
Journalist Killed in 
an Apparent Set-up 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Multiple sources indicate that the Director of 
HornAfrik in Mogadishu, Said Tahlil Ahmed, was assassinated 
in Mogadishu on February 4 at approximately 2:45 p.m.  We are 
told that on the morning of February 4, the directors of ten 
media outlets in Mogadishu were summoned to a meeting by a 
member of al-Shabaab's "information department."  Our 
contacts tell us al-Shabaab reportedly wanted to discuss with 
the media owners their positive reporting on the Djibouti 
peace process and the media's recent resolve to stop 
broadcasting extremist material (septel).  When the media 
owners arrived at the appointed location, which was in the 
Bakara Market area, the al-Shabaab associate suggested moving 
the meeting to another nearby building.  As the journalists 
rounded a corner en route to the second location, a group of 
armed militia hidden nearby opened fire on the group. 
Reports indicate that Ahmed was fatally wounded in the 
gunfire.  We have no information indicating injuries to other 
journalists. 
 
Post's Reaction 
--------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post is monitoring this incident and will report any 
further substantial details.   This is the second murder of a 
Somali journalist this year, following the New Year's Day 
death of a Shabelle journalist in Mogadishu.  We will discuss 
this incident with the government of newly-elected President 
Sharif, emphasizing our support for a vibrant and free media 
in Somalia.  In addition, Post will likely send a letter of 
condolence to Ahmed's family, as has been our practice in 
previous incidents of violence against journalists.  Post's 
ongoing support and encouragement of journalists, 
particularly those who remain inside Somalia despite the 
volatile operating environment for media, have been welcomed 
by journalists, who term it "vital."
