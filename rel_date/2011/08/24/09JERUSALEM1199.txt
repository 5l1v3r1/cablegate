SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (07/14): Conflicting Press Reports 
on Potential Delay in Next Round of Reconciliation Talks 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
News surrounding the Palestinian reconciliation talks continues to 
receive lead coverage in all dailies.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports 
that Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas might request that 
Egypt postpone the next round of talks originally scheduled for July 
25 until after the conclusion of the Fatah Congressional Conference 
on August 4.  Al-Ayyam reports, however, that the leader of the 
Fatah parliamentary block, Azzam Al-Ahmad, denies these reports. 
Al-Quds reports on recent comments made by Hamas's Gaza leader 
Ismail Haniyeh that "Hamas is in favor of pursuing the national 
unity talks between the Palestinian factions to end the division," 
and that once an agreement is reached, he will resign. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's front page reports on statements made by 
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, criticizing remarks made 
by the European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs, 
Javier Solana on July 11, in which Solana urged the UN Security 
Council to consider the full membership of a Palestinian state in 
the UN regardless of whether an agreement has been reached between 
the Israelis and Palestinians.  Lieberman is also reported as 
stating that Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas is 
"illegitimate and doesn't represent the Palestinian people."  Al 
Quds reports Presidential spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh's response 
that this was yet another "dangerous" indication of the Israeli 
government's attempts to avoid recognizing a Palestinian state. 
 
Al-Quds reports on statements made by PLO Chief Negotiator Saeb 
Erekat on July 13 that US Special Envoy George Mitchell's upcoming 
visit to the region will focus on reviving peace talks between 
Israel and the Palestinians. Erekat called on the US and Europe to 
take action in compelling Israel to stop its settlement activities, 
noting that the cessation of settlement expansion is an obligation 
under the Road Map that must be fulfilled in order for any peace 
talks to be successful. 
 
Al-Ayyam's and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's front-pages include reports of 
the demolition of two Palestinian homes in the Beit Hanina and 
Silwan neighborhoods in East Jerusalem July 13, allegedly as both 
homes lacked appropriate building permits.  Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam 
both have above the fold photos of the demolished homes.  Al-Hayat 
Al- Jadida's lead photo depicts a Palestinian woman pointing to her 
farm, which was reportedly attacked and set alight by settlers near 
the town of Beit Ommar in Hebron on July 13. The settlers burned 
more than 150 dunums of land, according to the report. 
All dailies report on the meeting between Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and the Middle East Quartet Representative Tony 
Blair on July 13.  According to reports, Netanyahu and Blair 
explored ways to improve the Palestinian economy in the West Bank 
and Gaza. Netanyahu is reported as stating that "better economic 
achievements can be attained in the West Bank if the Palestinian 
Authority cooperates with Israel."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al-Quds editorial, "Solana's proposal: Positive but needs 
enforcement" (07/14): "Solana's statements regarding the Palestinian 
state are extremely positive ... but we must call on Solana and the 
EU to translate these statements into actions on the ground.  The 
Israelis have to understand that the whole world is in favor of the 
 
JERUSALEM 00001199  002 OF 002 
 
 
two-state solution and an independent Palestinian state.  If 
(Israel) doesn't understand this fact, it will become increasingly 
marginalized and isolated." 
 
2) Muhannad Abdel Hamid, Al-Ayyam, "Solana... the first serious 
stance against Israel" (07/14): "Solana's position has changed the 
game... If he receives the necessary support, this position could be 
taken by the international community in confronting Israel... It 
could successfully initiate a political solution towards ending the 
conflict."
