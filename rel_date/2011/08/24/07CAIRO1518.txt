(SBU) Hisham Youssef, Arab League Chief of Staff, was quoted 
in local media on May 20 as "strongly condemning" the May 16 
killing of four peacekeepers from the African Union's Mission 
in Somalia (AMISOM).  On May 23, Samir Hosni, head of the 
Arab League Office of African Affairs, told poloff that this 
attack highlighted the need for the Ethiopian-backed 
Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to work towards 
inclusive reconciliation, including with remnants of the 
Union of Islamic Courts (UIC).  The League position, he said, 
supported  a withdraw of Ethiopian troops from Somalia in 
favor of a stronger AMISOM force.  Hosni said that "at least 
the moderate members" of the former UIC must be part of the 
political process.  Hosni suggested that the new UN-led 
International Advisory Committee on Somalia could help 
mobilize funding for more African troops for AMISOM.
