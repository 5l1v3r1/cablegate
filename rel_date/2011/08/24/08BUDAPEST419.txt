SUBJECT: EBRD: HUNGARY SUPPORTS U.S. APPROACH ON TURKEY 
 
REF: STATE 41999 
 
    Ministry of Finance State Secretary Almos Kovacs 
expressed broad agreement with the U.S. approach on 
accelerated strategic review of European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) mandate and future 
operations and subsequent consideration of a Turkish 
application to be a country of operation (reftel).  Kovacs 
stressed that, while it is incumbent on the EBRD to make its 
continued support of ex-Communist countries a priority, 
Turkey could be an appropriate target for future EBRD 
operations.  Beyond lending, Kovacs offered that what Hungary 
and neighboring countries took from their EBRD experience 
included development of capital markets, easing 
privatization, and helping to open and optimize economies. 
In terms of Turkey, Kovacs expressed appreciation for U.S. 
efforts to address this issue directly with Turkish 
government officials, and readiness to cooperate in the 
months to come.
