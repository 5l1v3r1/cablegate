¶1. (U) Embassy Caracas is pleased to nominate Isela I. 
Iguaran for the Secretary's Award for International Women of 
Courage, per reftel. 
 
¶2. (U) Nominee: Isela I. Iguaran 
 
¶3. (U) Title and Institution: President, Bloque Vecinal 
Indigena (Indigenous Issues NGO) 
 
¶4. (U) Date of Birth: February 14, 1957 
 
¶5. (U) Contact Information: Mobile: 58-0416-562-5505; e-mail

¶6. (SBU) Justification: Isela Iguaran, President of the 
Indigenous Issues NGO Bloque Vecinal Indigena, is a tireless 
defender of the rights of the Wayuu indigenous people and a 
long-time advocate of women's issues in Venezuela.  (Note: 
The Wayuu is one of the largest indigenous groups in 
Venezuela with a population of approximately 17,000, mostly 
concentrated in northwestern Venezuela.  End Note.)  Through 
her work with Bloque Vecinal Indigena, she helped create over 
100 neighborhood associations in Zulia state, western 
Venezuela.  Iguaran's leadership capabilities and sustained 
commitment to these associations has equipped regional 
activists with the skills necessary to tackle local problems, 
effectively lobby elected officials, and develop positive 
activities for their communities.  Similarly, Iguaran has 
been instrumental in the creation of 10 import-export 
cooperatives aimed at producing greater social and economic 
benefits for the Wayuu community along the 
Venezuelan-Colombian border. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Iguaran is staunchly committed to quality and 
culturally-sensitive education.  She has held several 
administrative positions pertaining to education, including 
Coordinator of Cultural Programs in Paez municipality and 
Superintendent of Education of Zulia state.  She currently 
works as an elementary school teacher in western Venezuela. 
Separately, Iguaran is a member of the Permanent Commission 
on Indigenous Issues, Resources, and Environment of the Zulia 
State Legislature. 
 
¶8. (SBU) At a time when human rights defenders have become 
the targets of increased scrutiny for their work in the 
service of others, Iguaran has shown exceptional courage in 
her unwavering dedication to demanding social, cultural, and 
economic benefits for indigenous peoples and women.  Though 
the environment in which Iguaran works in is highly 
politically polarized, she nevertheless remains committed to 
securing these fundamental human rights for her community at 
large.

issues is Poloff Ms. Veronica Torres; phone: 58-212-907-8052;
