OCTOBER 30 VOTE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 114403 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified--Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  An official in the Indonesian Department 
of Foreign Affairs indicated possible GOI support for the 
U.S.-backed resolution re "compliance with non-proliferation" 
in the October 30 vote in the First Committee.  Mission 
underscored the importance of Indonesian support.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On October 30, PolMilOff conveyed USG 
Indonesia-specific talking points and reftel text to Andy 
Rachmianto, Deputy Director for International Security and 
Disarmament at the Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU). 
PolMilOff noted that Indonesia had abstained in the vote on 
the 2005 resolution, underscored the importance of the 
resolution for advancing compliance, and emphasized recent 
efforts to find compromise language acceptable to Indonesia. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Rachmianto expressed appreciation for the U.S. 
discussion.  He noted he had sent DEPLU's instructions to 
Indonesian representative Desra Percaya in New York the 
previous week and said the Indonesian and U.S. positions had 
become somewhat closer.  Without explicitly promising 
Indonesian support for the U.S.-backed resolution, he said 
the Indonesian support could be exchanged for U.S. support on 
the resolution that Indonesia planned to introduce in 2009 
regarding the Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone 
(SEANWFZ).  PolMilOff pressed but Rachmianto declined to 
confirm explicitly whether Indonesia would vote for the 
proposal.
