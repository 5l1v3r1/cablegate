(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel talking points to MFA Deputy 
Director General for the United Nations Juan Manuel Gonzalez 
de Linares. Gonzalez de Linares stated that the CCIT is one 
of his government's biggest foreign policy priorities, and 
they are anxious to get it passed and thrilled to see the 
United States pushing it in advance of the upcoming 
consultations in New York. He expressed his government's 
frustration with countries that would not agree to the 
convention, and said that if a few countries continued to 
stall its passage, Spain would be willing to move forward on 
the convention without their support, forcing them to choose 
whether to be part of or remain outside of this major 
international initiative.
