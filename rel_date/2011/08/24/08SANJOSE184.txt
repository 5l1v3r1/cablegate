REF: STATE 18101 
 
 ¶1. On February 28 we contacted Randolph Coto, Foreign Policy 
Coordinator of the FMA and shared with him the issues 
contained in the reftel. 
 
¶2. Coto indicated the GOCR was well aware of these piracy 
issues and of the impending end of the current mandate this 
month. 
 
¶3.  On March 4 we followed up with Coto and Juan Salas, MFA 
UNSC desk officer. Both indicated the GOCR will support 
renewal of the AMISON mandate but will decide later whether 
it would help draft or support a UNSC resolution enabling 
assistance from willing countries to address piracy off the 
Somali coast.
