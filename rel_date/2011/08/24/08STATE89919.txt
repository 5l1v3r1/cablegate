SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050118911 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050118911 for the export 
of a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) camera system to Russia. 
 Post is requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 
30 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will 
affect pending and future licenses involving parties to this 
license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Unfamiliar foreign end-user, 
Diagnost, and unfamiliar foreign consignee, Zenit.  Neither 
company has appeared on any previous license applications, 
nor have the bona fides of the companies been verified by a 
Blue Lantern check. 
 
 
¶4. ACTION:  Department requests that Embassy make appropriate 
inquiries to verify the bona fides of foreign end-user 
Diagnost and foreign consignee Zenit and to confirm the 
legitimacy of this proposed transaction.  PM/DTCC also 
requests that post conduct site visits to the companies in 
order to provide Department with an assessment of their 
business operations and on-site security.  Finally, post is 
asked to assess whether the companies appear to be reliable 
recipients of USML items.  If a site visit is not possible, 
please inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions for both companies are provided as 
suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation, including 
purchase orders, for this proposed transaction? 
 
--What role will Zenit play in the proposed transaction? 
Will Zenit be handling or storing the items listed on the 
application?  If so, does it have secure facilities and 
proper accounting and security procedures for handling these 
sensitive USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
END ACTION
