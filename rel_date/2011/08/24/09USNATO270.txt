SUBJECT: UNODC ASSURANCE ON LEAHY VETTING FOR U.S. FUNDS 
FOR NRC COUNTERNARCOTICS PROJECT 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ambassador Daalder received a letter dated June 16 
from James Callahan, the Central Asia Regional Representative 
for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), 
regarding the distribution of USG funds within the 
NATO-Russia Council Counter Narcotics program.  In the 
letter, Callahan assures the Ambassador that U.S. funds will 
be spent in a manner consistent with applicable U.S. laws, 
specifically the so-called "Leahy Vetting" requirements. 
(Note: Mission scanned and e-mailed the letter to EUR-RPM.)

BEGIN TEXT 
 
 
16 June 2009 
 
Dear Mr. Ambassador, 
 
I am writing in regard to UNODC's implementation of the 
NATO-Russia Council "Pilot Project on Training of Central 
Asian and Afghan Law Enforcement Personnel," known in UNODC 
nomenclature as Project XAC/197. 
 
UNODC fully understands the requirement under US legislation 
and security assistance policy to vet the names of persons 
who will be trained under USG funding in counter-narcotics 
capacities.  We are making every effort and will step up 
those efforts to assure that the requirements are met for 
programs involving US funding.  For your information, all the 
nominations in the Central Asian countries and Afghanistan go 
through and must have approval of two or three governmental 
agencies, a time-consuming bureaucratic system but we 
continue to work with the governments to require timely 
submissions of their nominees. 
 
UNODC will assure that US contributions to the XAC/197 
projects will only be spent on training events for which 
vetting has been completed as required by the US Government. 
We will segregate US funds from NRC contributions from other 
NRC member countries and provide separate accountings of 
expenditures of US funds.  Should situations arise where 
vetting cannot be completed due to failure of beneficiary 
countries to provide participant details in time for proper 
vetting, contributions from other NRC countries will be used 
to cover the costs of those training events.  UNODC will 
continue to work with beneficiary countries to obtain timely 
information and minimize situations where vetting cannot be 
performed. 
 
For future pledge letters pertaining to funds from the USA on 
which there are potential concerns about vetting, training 
held at Domodedovo and TADOC, etc., NATO/NRC could insert 
conditions as needed to cover these areas.  UNODC would then 
have to function as described above, taking care that US 
funds would be used only on permitted events for which 
vetting could be completed. 
 
I hope that this letter satisfies the Department of State's 
requirements and stand ready to discuss any other issues 
related to the US participation in the NATO-Russia Council 
project. 
 
Best regards, 
/S/ 
James Callahan
