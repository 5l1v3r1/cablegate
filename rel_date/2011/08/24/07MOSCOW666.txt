REFTEL: USDOC 06594 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Kirishinefteorgsintez, Kirishi, Russia. The company is 
listed on BIS license application D368112 as the 
ultimate consignee of 10-inch Monel plug valve. These 
items are controlled for chemical or biological 
warfare reasons under ECCN 2B350. The licensee is 
Xomox Corporation, 4444 Cooper Road, Cincinnati, OH 
¶45242. 
 
¶3. On January 30, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of 
Kirishinefteorgsintez (Russian acronym KINEF), Shosse 
Entuziastov 1, Kirishi, Russia. The export control 
team met with Aleksandr Mamrov, Head of Foreign Trade 
Department. 
 
¶4. KINEF was founded in 1966 as an oil and petroleum 
refinery.  With a throughput of over 20,000,000 tons 
per year, KINEF is one of the largest refinery 
operations in Russia. KINEF has 60 production lines 
for gasoline, benzene, diesel, Jet-A, aromatics and 
other petroleum products, and can support rail, tanker 
and pipeline transportation and distribution. The 
company sells half of its output on the Russian 
market, and exports the remainder worldwide. In 1993 
KINEF became a daughter company of Surgutneftegas, and 
currently operates as a Limited Liability Company, and 
employs 6500 at its Kirishi refinery complex. 
 
¶5. KINEF is in the construction stage of a 
2,000,000,000 USD project to construct a hydro 
cracking facility, at an area about 5 km from the main 
plant in Kirishi.  Most of the equipment for the new 
plant has been imported from Europe, Asia and the 
United States.  Hydro cracking is a catalytic cracking 
process that allows the production of light petroleum 
products such as jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG) and gasoline products from heavy crude 
distillation fractions.  The process to be utilized at 
the facility is licensed from Cheveron, and ABB Lummus 
Global is participating in the design and fitting of 
the plant.   Mr. Mamrov projects the creation of an 
additional 6000 jobs as the hydro cracker facility 
comes online. 
 
¶6. The plug valve in reftel will be utilized at the 
hydro cracker facility.  The plant will be on an 
extension to the grounds of the KINEF facility.  An 
armed security force is on duty at all times at KINEF 
facilities, and access to the refinery is restricted. 
While thousands of employees will have access to the 
valve, it is a critical part and any theft would be 
quickly noticed.    Security cameras and intrusion 
detection devices monitor all perimiter walls and 
fences, along with "additional methods," upon which 
Mr. Mamrov would not expand. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends 
Kirishinefteorgsintez, Kirishi, Russia, as reliable 
recipients of sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is 
requested that post be notified of final disposition 
of the application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
