Â¶1.  (SBU) Econoff delivered the demarche contained in reftel 
to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Non-proliferation, 
Science, and Nuclear Energy Division Deputy Director Naoto 
Ito September 15th.  Ito agreed with USG concerns about 
Middle East issues dominating the agenda, and said Japan's 
mission is also attempting to achieve a consensus outcome. 
Unfortunately, Ito was unable to provide specifics on Japan's 
plans for voting on any given resolution, as all the key GOJ 
decision makers are already in Vienna.  While he promised to 
relay U.S. concerns up his chain of command as best he could, 
he implied that U.S. Mission UNVIE would be able to best 
engage the GOJ on voting specifics.
