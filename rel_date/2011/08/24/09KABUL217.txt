SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT ELECTION COMMISSION ANNOUNCES AFGHAN 
ELECTIONS FOR AUGUST 20 
 
REF: KABUL 0181 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Dr. Azizullah Lodin, President of the Independent 
Election Commission (IEC), on January 29 told the media that 
the date for Afghanistan's presidential and provincial 
council elections will be August 20, 2009.  Flanked by his 
fellow Commissioners as well as Chief Technical Officer Dr. 
Daoud Ali Najafi, Lodin told a full representation of 
domestic and international television and print media 
organizations that the Commission arrived at this decision 
under the authority of both the constitution and the 
electoral law. With a copy of the constitution aloft, and 
with several quotes from both texts, Lodin emphasized the 
IEC's authority to set the election date. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Lodin also highlighted the constitutional right to 
a universal franchise in his remarks, noting that the August 
date allowed the IEC time to organize a free, fair and 
transparent process and to mobilize donor funding.  He 
reported that the Afghan national security forces recommended 
a late summer or fall date, to allow time to stabilize the 
security situation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  In a departure from earlier prickly and erratic 
media appearances, Dr. Lodin deftly fielded a range of 
questions.  He referred inquiries on security and the 
possible impact of the reported increase in US forces to the 
security organizations, while noting that the IEC enjoys 
close cooperation with the police, army, and ISAF. He told 
journalists that the IEC is not the government institution 
empowered to resolve possible questions about the President's 
authority during the time between the May 22 date stipulated 
in the constitution (REFTEL) and August 20.  Lodin added that 
the constitution's much-quoted Article 61 ("The presidential 
term shall expire on the first of Jowza (May 22) of the fifth 
year after elections.  Elections for the new president shall 
be held within 30 to 60 days prior to the end the 
presidential term.") contains the clause "after elections," 
which he as an individual took to mean the constitution 
intends the president to serve until new elections are held. 
One journalist asked if the "Independent Election Commission" 
is really "Karzai's Election Commission." Lodin replied that 
the IEC is exactly like other independent commissions, such 
as the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, 
established under the guidelines of the constitution and the 
law.
