¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. The IDF arrested 20 senior Hamas officials 
in the West Bank overnight on March 18-19.  The IDF also 
re-arrested a separate set of lower-profile Hamas during the 
week of March 9.  Both Hamas and the PA President's office 
put out statements criticizing the arrests.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Overnight on March 18-19, the IDF arrested 20 senior 
Hamas members in the West Bank.  Some of note are: 
 
- Dr. Nasser Eddin Al-Sha'er, former Deputy Prime Minister 
under Hamas PM Ismail Haniyeh, was released from Israeli 
prison July 2007.  In January 2009, he signed a multi-faction 
petition appealing for a national reconciliation dialogue and 
a national unity government (REF A). 
 
- Ayman Daragmeh is a PLC member who signed the January 2009 
unity appeal (REF A). 
 
- Adnan Asfour is a PLC member who was released from 
detention November 2008. 
 
- Mazen Al-Rimawi is the Office director of the PLC bloc in 
Ramallah. 
 
- Nizar Ramadan was released from a three-year prison term in 
December 2008. 
 
- Azam Salhab was released from a Hebron prison in January 
¶2009. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On March 19, President Abbas' spokesman, Nabil Abu 
Rudenineh, released a statement condemning the arrests.  He 
characterized the arrests as an attempt to sabotage the 
reconciliation talks.  Hamas also issued a statement saying 
the arrests were in response to the failure of talks to swap 
hundreds of Palestinian prisoners for the release of Israeli 
soldier Gilad Shalit. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Separately, the IDF re-arrested 12 lower-profile 
West Bank Hamas members during the week of March 9.  On March 
19, Hamas released a statement accusing the PA of 
coordinating its release of 52 Hamas detainees just prior to 
the Cairo talks (REF B), with the Israeli re-arrest of 12 
those same detainees.
