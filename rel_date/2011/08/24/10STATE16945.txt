¶1. (U) The Department has reviewed its files and finds that

visa application for this individual be filed with as much 
lead time as possible to allow for additional processing 
procedures that may be required.  Note that if, at any time, 
the Embassy becomes aware of any information regarding 
incidents which could be deemed to be credible information of 
a gross violation of human rights by this individual, the 
Embassy should so inform the Department.
