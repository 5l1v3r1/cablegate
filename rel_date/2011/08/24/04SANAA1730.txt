¶1. On 7/18, Pol/Econ Chief met with Dr. Ahmed Alwan Mulhi, 
Deputy Director of the Department of International 
Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to 
deliver talking points on U.S. initiatives for the 59th UNGA. 
 Mulhi agreed that Yemen is generally supportive of promoting 
economic freedom, democratization and reducing trafficking in 
persons.  He noted that Yemeni officials have been invited by 
the UN to give a presentation on democratization in New York 
in October or November highlighting Yemen's role as a model 
for the region, but that no decision has been taken on 
whether they will accept the offer. 
 
¶2. Mulhi acknowledged that Emboffs have presented the U.S. 
position on human cloning to MFA officials a number of times 
(e.g., ref b) and commented that the issue is somewhat 
political.  He nodded when Pol/Econ Chief presented the 
initiative on reducing the number of unbalanced Middle East 
resolutions and abolishing the Committee to Investigate 
Israeli Practices, but did not comment.  He was pleased to 
receive the points in English and Arabic and promised to pass 
the information to the Foreign Minister expeditiously. 
 
¶3. When asked about Yemeni initiatives and attendance at the 
UNGA, Mulhi said that the ROYG has not yet decided on 
attendees and is still discussing initiatives.  He pledged to 
stay in contact about attendees and meeting requests (ref b).
