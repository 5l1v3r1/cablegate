SUBJECT: USUN INSTRUCTIONS: UNSC CONSULTATIONS ON SUDAN 
SANCTIONS COMMITTEE 
 
¶1.  USUN may draw on the following points during the 
September 11 Security Council Consultations on the UNSC Sudan 
Sanctions Committee: 
 
-- The United States would like to thank Italian Ambassador 
Terzi for his statement and for his efforts as the new Chair 
of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to 
resolution 1591 (2005) concerning the Sudan. 
 
-- We would also like to express our appreciation for the 
work of the Committee's Panel of Experts, which is done under 
challenging circumstances.  We thank the Panel of Experts for 
their work to highlight ways to improve the implementation of 
the measures imposed by the Security Council, and we 
anticipate the release of their next report in the coming 
weeks. 
 
-- The United States notes with grave concern the recent 
events on the ground, including the fighting last week in 
North Darfur that resulted in many civilian deaths, large 
civilian displacement, and destruction of cities in North 
Darfur.  The 25 August attacks on the Kalma internally 
displaced persons camp in South Darfur left more than 40 
people dead, most of them women and children, and even more 
wounded.  We are increasingly troubled by the continuing 
violence, combined with increasing bureaucratic harassment 
and denial of humanitarian access to affected populations. 
 
-- The United States calls upon all parties to immediately 
cease hostilities; cooperate with UN/AU Chief Mediator 
Bassole; and renew the political process to achieve a 
negotiated settlement for an inclusive peace agreement. 
 
-- We also call upon the Government of Sudan to fully 
cooperate to allow for a complete and rapid deployment of 
UNAMID; facilitate humanitarian access; grant multiple-entry 
visas to the Panel of Experts; assist the Panel of Experts in 
arranging meetings with officials from the government; cease 
the use of aircraft painted white to resemble humanitarian 
aircraft; and work to stop violations of the existing arms 
embargo. 
 
-- We remind the Government of Sudan that it must fully 
implement and comply with the measures in UNSCR 1591 (2005), 
which includes freezing the assets and preventing the entry 
into or transit through their territories of designated 
individuals.  UNSC resolution 1591 also requires the 
Government of Sudan seek Committee approval in advance of 
moving weapons, ammunition and military equipment into the 
Darfur region. 
 
-- The United States encourages the 1591 Committee and its 
Panel of Experts to focus on concrete ways to enhance 
implementation of the measures specified in UNSCR 1591 (2005) 
with specific attention to the origin of arms flowing into 
Darfur.
