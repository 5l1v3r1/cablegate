¶1.  (SBU) Ambassador spoke to Polish Foreign Minister Daniel 
Rotfeld on June 30 to urge him to support the U.S. agenda for 
reform of the UN.  Drawing on Reftels A and B, Ambassador 
emphasized the importance the Secretary attaches to broad 
reform, and emphasized that this goes farther than UNSC 
reform or expansion.  Rotfeld expressed agreement with the 
need for reform, and said he would review our agenda 
carefully. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Polcouns separately delivered Ref A and Ref B 
demarche to Tomasz Chlon, MFA Deputy Director for UN Affairs, 
June 17.  Chlon expressed pleasure at receiving the details 
of our reform agenda, and said there was a great deal of 
similarity between the US agenda and Polish thinking on UN 
reform.  Chlon said he hoped Poland and the U.S. could 
cooperate closely as the High Level Event (HLE) approaches, 
and said Poland would welcome high level consultations on the 
details of reform.  He said there is also "promising" 
prospects for U.S.-EU cooperation.  Chlon said the Polish 
outlook is very "idealistic," and based on the concept that 
the UN can be reformed and can become a more relevant, 
effective body.  He promised to review our proposals more 
thoroughly and get back to us with specific responses at a 
later date. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Chlon said the Poles also have concerns about 
specific aspects of the Draft Outcome Document being worked 
in New York, and believe it is "not ambitious enough."  In 
particular, they want reference to a responsibility to 
protect individuals, and realize that negotiations will need 
to address the "collision" between the principles of 
sovereignty and protection of human rights.  (NOTE:  Chlon 
forwarded to Polcouns Poland's proposed revisions to the 
Draft Outcome Document, which we have forwarded to IO by 
e-mail.)  He expressed great interest in following up with us 
on the details of our reform agenda as the date for the HLE 
approaches.
