¶1. We thank Embassy New Delhi's Political Section for allowing our 
senior political FSN, Kanishka Bakshi, to look over the shoulders of 
his Indian colleagues for a week a the end of May.  Though that week 
was an especially busy one in India, the section's officers and FSNs 
still made time to introduce Mr. Bakhshi to the practices, 
procedures and habits that have long distinguished New Delhi's 
political reporting and advocacy.  He found the experience very 
instructive and is already applying the lessons learned to his own 
office. 
 
¶2. In particular, Mr. Bakshi cited the generous assistance of 
Political Section Deputy Atul Keshap, Political Officers Douglas 
Johnson and David Holmes and FSNs A. Sukesh, Shireen Singh, Dinesh 
Dubey and Alice Pandey. 
 
¶3. As the youngest mission in the bureau, we know we have a lot to 
learn.  We consider ourselves privileged and fortunate to be able to 
benefit from the experience of bureau colleagues that continue to 
set standards for Foreign Service excellence.
