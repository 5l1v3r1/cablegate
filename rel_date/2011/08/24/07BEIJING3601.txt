to exchange views on the Six-Party Talks and other 
international and bilateral issues. 
 
Sudan, Asia-EU Meeting 
---------------------- 
 
¶3.  China seeks a comprehensive solution to the Darfur issue, 
Jiang replied when asked about EU pressure and a proposed 
humanitarian corridor through Chad.  FM Yang is attending the 
Asia-EU Foreign Ministers meeting in Hamburg and China 
supports implementing the second phase of the Annan plan and 
a diplomatic resolution to the Darfur issue, said Jiang. 
 
Death for Former Head of Food and Drug Administration 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4.  Asked for comment on the sentencing to death of former 
head of the State Food and Drug Administration Zheng Xiaoyu, 
the spokesperson said the MFA is not an authority on the 
matter as the case is an internal affair of China.  She 
remarked though that the sentencing reflects the Government's 
commitment to fighting anti-corruption and that the lives and 
security of the Chinese people are top priorities. 
 
Fight Climate Change within UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5.  The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
and Kyoto Protocol form the legal international basis for 
fighting climate change, said Jiang when asked why China was 
resisting further measures on the issue at the Asia-EU 
Foreign Ministers meeting in Hamburg.  Jiang stressed that 
climate change is a global challenge faced by all countries 
and China has taken a variety of measures to fight the 
problem.  She reiterated that the impact of developing 
nations must be treated fairly by developed nations and said 
the issue should be handled within the UNFCCC and Kyoto 
Protocol. 
 
OIE Restores China's "Lawful Rights" 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶6.  Jiang praised the recognition of Mainland China as a 
sovereign state by the World Organization for Animal Health 
(OIE) as the "lawful restoration of the People's Republic of 
China's rights," in response to a question from Xinhua News 
Agency.  She added that Taiwan will continue to participate 
as a non-official member under the name "Taipei, China" and 
Taiwan's activities in the organization would not be 
restricted.

--------------------------------------------- -

¶7.  China has made solemn representation to Japan in regards 
to the upcoming visit of Taiwan's former "president" Lee 
Teng-hui, said Jiang when asked by a reporter for comment. 
She called on Japan to act in accordance with the principles 
of the three joint documents between the two countries, abide 
by commitments made on the Taiwan issue and not provide a 
platform for the Taiwan separatist movement.  Asked for 
clarification on the MFA's view of Lee, Jiang replied that 
Lee's words and deeds have proven he is a "separatist." 
 
¶8.  On May 25 DG of Asian Affairs Hu Zhengyue and Japan's 
head of Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau Kenichiro Sasae led 
the eighth round of talks on resolving the two countries' 
dispute in the East China Sea, said Jiang.  She said the next 
round of negotiations would be held in the later half of June 
and expressed hope that the two sides could work out a plan 
of joint development acceptable to both parties. 
 
Extradition Treaties Promising No Death Penalty? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶9. China has signed extradition treaties with twenty-nine 
countries, is in contact with another twenty-one on the same 
issue and has mutual legal assistance agreements with 
forty-one countries, responded Jiang when asked about media 
reports that China has promised not to pursue the death 
penalty for extradited suspects in extradition and 
repatriation treaties with Western countries.  Jiang praised 
China for its contributions to international anti-corruption 
efforts. 
 
Indian Official Refused Chinese Visa 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶10.  China hopes border issues with India can be solved at an 
early date, but until then such issues should not be brought 
into friendly exchanges, said Jiang when asked about the 
denial of a Chinese visa to an Indian government official 
from the disputed region of Arunachal Pradesh.  The refused 
individual was to take part in a two-week training program 
for a group of Indian officials in Beijing. 
 
Guangxi Riots, Human Rights 
--------------------------- 
 
¶11.  Asked about riots in Guangxi and supposed discontent 
over family planning laws and poor health care in the region, 
the spokesperson called the issue an internal affair of China 
before maintaining that the laws and Constitution of China 
protect the freedoms and rights of the Chinese people. 
 
1999 Bombing of Embassy in Belgrade 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶12.  Asked by an AFP reporter what China's position was on 
the United States' 1999 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade, the spokesperson stated that China does not accept 
the explanation that the bombing was an accident.
