DELHI; POSITIVE PUBLIC REACTION 
 
REF: STATE 29482 
 
Charge delivered the "White Paper of the Interagency Policy 
Group's Report on U.S. Policy toward Afghanistan and 
Pakistan" and associated points to the Ministry of External 
Affairs Joint Secretary (Americas Division) Gaitri Kumar on 
March 31.  (Note: Nearly all of the Ministry's Afghanistan 
and Pakistan portfolio holders had departed Delhi prior to 
March 28 for Shanghai Cooperation Organization talks in 
Moscow which included talks on Afghanistan, then for The 
Hague for the UN-sponsored Afghanistan conference.  End 
Note.)  J/S Kumar reiterated that India and the U.S. share 
the same overall goals for Afghanistan, but offered little 
substantive response to the white paper.  She referred to 
positive public comments made earlier by Indian officials to 
include Foreign Secretary Menon's quote to the media on March 
30 saying "We welcome the very clear expression of will to 
carry through the struggle against extremism in Afghanistan 
and its roots in Pakistan, which is contained in the new 
comprehensive U. S. strategy.  India has a direct interest in 
the success of this international effort and India is ready 
to play a constructive role as a responsible power in 
defeating extremism of all kinds."
