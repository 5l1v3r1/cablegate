Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds leads with, and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam run front 
page news coverage of the Palestinian unity talks in Cairo.  The 
sixth session of the talks concluded on June 30 with no tangible 
results, according to coverage.  Egypt will host a seventh (final) 
round of talks on July 25 to ensure that the factions reach an 
agreement on all pending issues and noted that the signing of the 
reconciliation agreement originally scheduled for July 7 will be 
postponed to July 28 after the final round.  Fatah senior official 
Qurai' noted to Al-Quds that the factions have conducted extensive 
discussions of a number of issues concerning the political prisoners 
from Fatah and Hamas, elections arrangements, security forces and 
the formation of the government, without reaching a final agreement 
on any of these issues.  According to Egyptian officials, there was 
an interim agreement that included three elements, including forming 
a joint security force in Gaza which would start operations after 
the signing of the reconciliation agreement, forming a joint 
committee with representatives from all factions to coordinate and 
monitor the implementation of the reconciliation agreement, and 
identifying the general guidelines for solving the political 
prisoners issue. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with news citing Wafa on Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas having received Hamas leader Dweik in the

Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam front page and Al-Quds runs inside 
page coverage citing wire service reports on Israeli Defense 
Minister Barak's meeting with U.S. Envoy Mitchell on June 30 in New 
York.  Barak noted to the press that "it is too early to indicate 
whether Israel will temporarily freeze settlement activities in the 
West Bank" and noted that the talks with Mitchell were "positive," 
but that there still remain some "disagreements," according to 
coverage. 
 
All dailies run front page coverage of Palestinian Authority Prime 
Minister Fayyad's visit to Austria on June 30 and his speech on the 
60th anniversary of UNRWA.  Fayyad stressed the need to help 
Palestinian refugees retain hope by ending their sufferings and 
noted that the "time has come to force Israel to respect 
international resolutions and to stop violating international law." 
Fayyad urged the international community to stop the double 
standards in dealing with Israel, according to coverage. 
 
Al-Quds runs a front page photo of two demolished houses in the 
Al-Tour neighborhood of East Jerusalem, which according to coverage,

lack of appropriate building permits. In related news, all dailies 
run front page news of the resignation of the Palestinian Authority 
Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Abdul Qader on June 30.  The 
resignation was in protest to the Palestinian Authority's failure to 
pay the fees for the lawyers assigned by the PA to pursue the issue 
of Israeli attacks against the homes of Palestinians in East

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Hafeth Barghouti opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily 
under the title, "Hamas and Fatah" (07/01):  "It is obvious that 
Hamas doesn't want to be part of any unity government, Hamas doesn't 
look at the conflict and the internal division from a national point 
of view but rather from a very narrow and selfish perspective, it is 
not  willing to take any sacrifice and lose its control over Gaza. 
It prefers to expand its control over to the West Bank, but it will 
realize very soon that this approach is not helpful and it will be 
the first loser." 
 
2) Hamada Fara'na opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
e 
title "the story of Palestine" (07/01):  "In his speech, Fayyad 
clearly presented the history of the Palestinians' sufferings in a 
way that neither Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu can deny nor 
President Obama can refuse.  It was clear, comprehensive and 
factual.  It presented the lengthy sufferings and crises that should 
be ended soon."
