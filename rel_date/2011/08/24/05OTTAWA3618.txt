SUBJECT: CANADA: FUNDING APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION OF 
INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINERS AT JIPTC DELAYED 
 
REF: SECSTATE 197466 
 
¶1. (SBU) Foreign Affairs Peacekeeping and Peace Operations 
Group Director Wendy Gilmour has affirmed that Canada plans 
to extend its police trainers at the International Police 
Training Center for another year.  We understand that the 
extension had been endorsed by RCMP authorities and the 
funding request was before the Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA) when the House of Commons voted on 
November 28 to bring down the government. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Though Gilmour believes it unlikely that a new 
government will derail Canada's support for the Police 
Training Center, it is unclear whether the actual funding 
authorization will or can be signed prior to installation of 
a new government, sometime in the first quarter of 2006. 
Post will monitor the situation and report any developments 
as appropriate.
