In Today's Papers 
 
Prime Minister Erdogan: US, a Strategic Ally, Obliged to Act with 
Us 
All papers report that on Thursday, Prime Minister Erdogan, on a 
state visit to Romania, said in a news conference in Bucharest that 
the decision on a cross-border incursion into northern Iraq will be 
made by Ankara regardless of the reaction from Washington.  "As our 
strategic ally, America is obliged to act with us.  We acted 
together with them in Afghanistan," Erdogan emphasized.  Erdogan 
also rejected allegations that the aim of his upcoming US visit 
would be to secure clearance from Washington for a cross-border 
operation into Iraq's north.  Papers see the PM's remarks as a harsh 
response to Secretary Rice who had warned Turkey to abstain from 
intervention in northern Iraq. 
 
Papers comment that recent statements by US officials, seen as 
stalling tactics, aim to keep Turkey away from northern Iraq. 
Remarks coming from high level Americans including secretaries Rice 
and Gates are vague, according to several papers, and aim to keep 
any possible Turkish operations limited in scope.  Liberal Radikal 
draws attention to reports in the foreign press pointing to "ties" 
between the PKK militants and the US military, saying the US cannot 
be trusted in fighting against the PKK. 
 
Ongoing Turkish Operations In and Out of Northern Iraq 
All papers report the Turkish General Staff (TGS) confirmed Thursday 
that at least 30 of some 100 PKK militants were killed during an 
attack on a gendarme post in Semdinli in the Hakkari province on the 
border with Iraq.  Papers report operations backed by planes and 
helicopters continue.  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet claims Turkish 
fighter jets taking off from Diyarbakir air base bombed the PKK 
positions in northern Iraq whereas the Islamist-oriented Zaman 
claims the planes only made reconnaissance flights along the border 
and in Iraq.  Papers report over 1,000 special security forces were 
deployed to the region, and landmine sweeping continued on the 
border. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkish Iraq Incursion, US-Turkey 
Mehmet Tezkan comments in the mainstream daily Vatan:  "The US is 
obviously stalling Turkey on the PKK issue.  We only see statements 
from US officials and no concrete action.  One wonders if this is 
part of an American revenge-taking policy for Turkey's refusal to 
allow US forces to enter Iraq in 2003.  The man on the street is 
very much in the mood to follow the Israeli example and hit the 
targets in Northern Iraq without listening to anybody anymore.  PM 
Erdogan faces a very big challenge if he goes ahead with a 
comprehensive cross-border operation which includes the risk of the 
collapse of financial markets and a heavy blow to tourism.  In any 
case, if the PKK continues to carry out its attacks, the public 
reaction may be uncontrollable.  The hard part of this story is that 
there is no clear formula to overcome the crisis.  Both options -- 
carrying out a cross-border operation or not -- come with many 
problems attached." 
 
Taha Akyol observed in the mainstream daily Milliyet (10/26):  "It 
will be a long list if we try to list all the harms Turkey has faced 
as a result of US actions.  The Gulf War during the elder Bush's era 
and the Iraq War during George Bush's era are quite enough.  Turkey, 
due to these two events, not only suffered financially but also lost 
many lives because of terrorism and faced threats to its territorial 
integrity.  I'm not saying that the US administration shaped its 
strategy to harm Turkey deliberately but it is also valid to ask if 
the US should continue to pursue strategies which completely 
undermine its ally's vital interests.  Today it is very obvious that 
Barzani has put terrorism before Turkey because he feels encouraged 
due to US policies.  This is the point of no return.  Turkey faces 
terrorism and does not find its friend on its side.  The US must 
prove its friendship through deeds not for Turkey's sake but because 
of our bilateral strategic interests and for the stability of this

region." 
 
Iraqi High-Level Delegation in Ankara for PKK Talks 
All papers report that following the recent meetings of Foreign 
Minister Ali Babacan in Baghdad earlier this week, a high-level 
Iraqi delegation arrived in Ankara yesterday evening to discuss 
steps to eliminate the PKK's presence in the north of Iraq.  The 
Iraqi delegation will kick off talks Friday.  The delegation 
includes the Iraqi Minister for National Security Sherwan al-Waili, 
Defense Minister Abd al-Qadir al-Mufriji, intelligence chief 
al-Faisal, KDP foreign relations chief Safin Dizayi, PUK 
representative Imad Ahmad, and Interior Ministry U/S Aydin Halit. 
Some papers claim the Turkish General Staff (TGS) has objected to 
the two Kurdish representatives in the delegation participating in 
the meeting between TGS and the Iraqis today.  The Turkish Foreign 
Ministry (MFA) sources told papers Turkey attaches importance to 
this visit, warning it may be a "last chance" for Iraq. 
 
Cigarettes Smuggled into Turkey Provide Financial Support to the PKK 
 
Liberal Radikal and leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet report that 
according to the report published by the Smuggling and Organized 
Crime Bureau of the Security department around $2.5 billion worth of 
cigarettes are smuggled into Turkey every year.  Reportedly, 
cigarettes are produced in a factory in Dohuk and passed to the 
Barzani family's company to be distributed to the smugglers 
internally.  Cigarettes are smuggled into Turkey on donkeys and in 
groups of 10-15 people.  Before crossing the border, smugglers are 
forced to bribe the PKK militants at the border. 
 
An American University in Istanbul Allows the Headscarf 
Cumhuriyet reports that at the opening of New York's Alfred 
University Istanbul campus the majority of the students and parents 
were wearing the Islamic-style headscarf.  Some of the students 
complained that most of the teachers are wearing headscarves during 
classes and talking about religion and that there are even students 
attending the classes wearing a veil or full chador.  Students 
expressed their disappointment saying that they were expecting a 
US-style university.
