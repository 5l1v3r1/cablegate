Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Although the frequency of high-level contacts 
between Belarus and Cuba has subsided in 2007, the GOB 
continues to hope to build economic ties with Cuba, strongly 
supports the Cuban government, and has no interest in 
promoting democracy, human rights or free market reform.  End 
summary. 
 
Trade and Exchanges Continue 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Please see ref A for information on which remains 
accurate for responses to ref B questions one through three. 
Further to an exchange agreement (ref B), in February, a 
group from Belarusian Television traveled to Cuba. 
Furthermore, on December 28, Cuban Ambassador to Belarus Omar 
Medina Quintero stated Belarus and Cuba would continue 
bilateral cooperation in education, healthcare and 
transportation (ref C). 
 
Support for Pro-Cuban Positions While Ignoring Human Rights 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Question Four: Belarus has done nothing to support 
democracy and human rights in Belarus.  On April 27, the 
Belarusian parliamentary commission on international 
relations and the working group on cooperation with the Cuban 
parliament passed a resolution denouncing the sentencing of 
Cuban nationals in the United States for spying.  The 
declaration made no mention of human rights abuses in Cuba. 
 
Delegations: Belarusian Deputy Foreign Minister to Cuba 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Question Five: December 7-8 a delegation led by 
Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Gaysenok visited Havana for a 
meeting of the Intergovernmental Mixed Commission for 
Economic and Trade Collaboration.  Gaysenok's delegation 
reportedly included officials from the Belarusian state-owned 
petrochemical company Belneftekhim, Belvneshekonbank bank and 
the Ministry of Industry.
