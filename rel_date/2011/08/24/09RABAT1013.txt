ISLAMIC AFFAIRS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Ambassador met with Minister of 
Endowments and Islamic Affairs Ahmed Toufiq on Dec. 8.  In 
substantive and open talks, they discussed U.S.-Moroccan 
cooperation and the GOM's efforts to promote moderate Islam. 
Toufiq emphasized Morocco's role as a moderate force in the 
region and his ministry,s role in ensuring a unified, 
non-radical message in local mosques.  He also posited that 
budget constraints pose the biggest challenge for his 
Ministry.  End Summary.

Working with the U.S.

¶2.  (SBU) Minister of Endowments (Habous) and Islamic Affairs 
Ahmed Toufiq opened the meeting by expressing his desire for 
the U.S. and Morocco to work constructively towards stability 
and moderation in the Arab and Islamic world.  He opined that 
Moroccans did not understand Americans well and suggested 
that the two countries should work to promote greater 
understanding.  The Ministry of Endowments and Islamic 
Affairs (MOEIA) as well as the King were involved in 
promoting justice in Morocco, which he explained is a main 
tenet of Islam as well as of democracy.  Morocco and the U.S. 
could also work together in other ways, he suggested. 
Morocco is "not just another country in the Maghreb; it has a 
specific role to play" in reducing conflicts, and is one of 
only two or three countries in the region that can do so.  In 
a subtle critique, Toufiq said he wanted the U.S. to 
understand better the importance of its relationship with 
Morocco, and for U.S. analysis of Morocco to be "deep" and 
focused on the long-term.  Over the next five to ten years, 
"things will not be easy for anyone" in the region, he said, 
and, therefore, "we all need to work together for peace and 
stability." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In reference to the divergent experiences of 
Morocco and Algeria in dealing with extremism, Toufiq noted 
Morocco,s "luck" in having a different history from 
Algeria,s, and asserted that "our neighbors are trying to 
copy (the moderation) we have here."  He acknowledged the 
deep distrust and nearly complete lack of cooperation between 
Algeria and Morocco, but described the two countries, 
current relationship as just a temporary "moment" of 
estrangement. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Emphasizing the unique and moderate nature of 
Moroccan Islam, Toufiq alluded to GOM concerns about the 
negative influence of external Islamic ideas.  Noting the 
GOM's desire to build a Moroccan mosque in Washington, D.C., 
he said "our people are like aliens among other Muslim 
communities" in the U.S.

Promoting Moderate Islam

¶5.  (SBU) In response to the Ambassador's comment on 
separation of church and state in the U.S., Toufiq stated 
unequivocally that it is impossible to make a clear 
distinction between "mosque" and state in Islam.  He 
explained that if the political leader is not also religious, 
people will be "expecting the mahdi" and will be "open to 
revolt."  It is necessary to assure people that everything 
political falls within the framework of religious 
fundamentals, he said, and the King has to be seen to be 
engaged in the process of justice. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Toufiq elaborated on the GOM's top-down efforts to 
control mosques and imams and to ensure a moderate version of 
Islam in the country.  He explained that the King had used 
royal decrees to create laws and define Islam in Morocco. 
One of the major changes the MOEIA had initiated under his 
leadership was creation of regional chiefs or delegates for 
each of Morocco's 69 -- and soon to be more than 80 -- 
administrative regions.  These delegates are charged with 
managing operations of Morocco's 47,000 mosques and councils 
of Ulema and with directing instruction in Koranic schools 
and for imams.  In addition to regulating instruction, the 
regional councils of Ulema have taken on other projects, such 
as literacy programs for up to 200,000 people per year.  He 
showed the Ambassador the MOEIA's "Guide for Imams," 
clarifying that imams are employees of the state; while they 
may receive money from their communities, they also receive 
government stipends.   He stressed that it was not enough to 
have security forces and an army but that the GOM also needed 
"to have the religious people on our side."

¶7.  (SBU) In response to the ambassador's question about 
problems facing MOEIA efforts, Toufiq highlighted a small 
budget as the biggest challenge.  He explained that 60 
percent of mosques in Morocco are built by non-governmental 
organizations and communities.  However, if communities want 
to run their mosques once they are constructed, they must 
conform to the rules.  The GOM will "not allow imams to use 
the pulpit for propaganda or politics," he stated.  Despite 
the MOEIA's top-down approach, Toufiq expressed hope that one 
day the GOM could return responsibility for mosques to 
communities.
