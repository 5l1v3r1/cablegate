bombed three houses overnight in Gaza; no injuries or 
fatalities were reported.  Israeli security sources told the 
media that one of the houses was bombed in an attempt to kill 
its owner, a member of the Popular Resistance Committee. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In Jerusalem on the evening of August 10, Israeli 
media reported an Italian tourist was stabbed and killed 
outside the Old City.  Israeli police told the media they 
suspect the killer was an Arab youth and that his motivation 
was political.  The media quoted unnamed Palestinian sources 
as denying that the killer was Palestinian. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In the West Bank, the IDF arrested a Hamas activist 
 
near the city of Tulkarem on August 10 according to the PA 
president's office.  On August 11, Israeli media reported 
that two Islamic Jihad militants were arrested near Jericho. 
 
Humanitarian Update

¶5.  (SBU) Nazmi Muhanna, head of the General Administration 
of Crossings and Borders, told ConGen FSN political 
specialist that the Rafah crossing opened August 11 at 0845 
local for limited departures, allowing students, workers with 
foreign permits, foreigners, and medical cases to exit. 
Rafah had opened August 10 for the same categories but 
closed early at 1230 local due to security concerns.  Muhanna 
reported that 1,670 people had departed Rafah August 10.

open August 11, according to Gaza-based USAID staff.
