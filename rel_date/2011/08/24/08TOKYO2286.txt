¶1.  (SBU)  Japan's top economic newspaper reported August 19 
that Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI), the 
GOJ-backed provider of international trade insurance, stopped 
accepting applications for trade insurance on deals with 
Cuba, prompting speculation about the future of Japan's 
Cuba-bound exports.  Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry 
(METI) officials, however, told Econoff there has been no 
final decision and the GOJ is working with Cuban Central Bank 
officials to resolve the matter. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Central Bank of Cuba informed NEXI in early 
August it was unable to make timely payment on recent imports 
from Japan due to a shortage of foreign exchange, according 
to the Nikkei newspaper.  NEXI subsequently announced it has 
downgraded Cuba's Central Bank to a status where it no longer 
qualifies for new export insurance.  According to the Japan 
External Trade Organization (JETRO) website, Japan exports to 
Cuba in 2007 totalled $176.5 million, up from $127.9 million 
in 2006.  Japanese exports to Cuba are mainly medical 
supplies and precision machinery. 
 
¶3.   (SBU)  NEXI is supervised by METI.  A responsible METI 
official confirmed to Embassy the basic substance of the 
Nikkei report but said "we have not decided to suspend 
underwriting trade insurance for exports to Cuba."  GOJ 
officials, he added, are working diligently to resolve the 
problem and the official hopes to provide the Embassy with 
more information early next week.
