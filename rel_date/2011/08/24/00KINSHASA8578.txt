¶1. EMBASSY KINSHASA POLITICAL CHIEF KENT BROKENSHIRE WILL 
PROCEED TO GOMA ON JANUARY 5 TO PREPARE FOR CODEL WOLF'S 
VISIT TO THE KIVUS. WE WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE RECEIVING A 
PROPOSED ITINERARY FOR THE CODEL, AS WELL AS A LIST OF 
INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WITH WHOM CONGRESSMAN WOLF WOULD LIKE 
TO MEET WHILE IN THE DRC. IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY PREFERENCES, 
EMBASSY KINSHASA CAN PROVIDE A SCHEDULE OF POSSIBLE 
APPOINTMENTS FOR THE CONGRESSMAN'S CONSIDERATION. 
 
 
¶2. GIVEN THE RWANDAN GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE CONGO 
WAR, EMBASSY STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE GOR NOT BE INVOLVED 
IN ARRANGING THOSE PORTIONS OF THE CODEL'S ITINERARY THAT 
TAKE PLACE IN THE CONGO. 
 
 
¶3. EMBASSY KINSHASA HOPES EMBASSY KIGALI CAN PROVIDE CODEL 
WOLF WITH ACCOMMODATION EXCHANGE AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION 
FROM KIGALI TO GOMA. 
 
 
¶4. AS MENTIONED BEFORE, THERE IS NO MONUC AIR SERVICE BETWEEN 
GOMA AND BUKAVU. COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, HOWEVER, REGULARLY MAKE 
THE SHORT FLIGHT. ONCE AGAIN, TO AVOID POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE 
FEELINGS IN A NUMBER OF QUARTERS, EMBASSY POLICY IS TO AVOID 
USING RWANDAN GOVERNMENT AIR SERVICES, AND RELY INSTEAD ON 
CONGOLESE COMMERCIAL CARRIERS. 
 
 
¶5. SRSG MORJANE HAS ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR OF MAXIMUM 
FLEXIBILITY AND SUPPORT CONCERNING CONGRESSMAN WOLF'S VISIT. 
MONUC NORMALLY FLIES FROM GOMA TO KINSHASA EVERY MONDAY, 
WEDNESDAY, AND FRIDAY. WE WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE THE DATE CODEL WOLF PLANS TO REACH KINSHASA.
