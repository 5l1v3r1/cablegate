¶1.  (U) At the tenth annual Cairo Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) trade fair on February 5, 
Minister of Communications and Information Technology Dr. 
Tarek Kamel made several announcements of note: 
 
   - The GOE would issue the long-awaited Request For 
Proposals (RFP) to license a third mobile phone provider by 
February 15, and the RFP would last for eight weeks. 
 
   - The Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology (MCIT), in cooperation with Intel, Microsoft, and 
Taiwanese firm VIA, would launch the Economic PC Initiative 
for the sale and delivery of inexpensive computers to 
low-income households at a cost of LE 1,500 (approximately 
$263), to be paid in monthly installments of only LE 49 
($8-9). 
 
   - The GOE's Information Technology Industrial Development 
Authority would grant e-signature licenses to four local 
firms; licenses are required in conjunction with the 
promulgation of a 2004 law granting e-signatures legal 
recognition, but until now the GOE has never issued any. 
 
   - In the context of liberalizing international calls and 
improving broadband service, as of February 20, the GOE would 
allow certain classes of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) 
the right to buy international calling hours from 
international resellers (at present they are required to buy 
from state-controlled Telecom Egypt (TE)) to provide data 
communications.  The ISPs would need to work with the 
National Telecommunication Regulatory Authority (NTRA) to 
adjust their licenses accordingly. 
 
   - NTRA also planned to issue, on March 1, two licenses for 
international calls using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) 
technology over mobile and fixed telephones.  The GOE would 
limit the two licensees to using TE's landing points in Suez 
and Alexandria for the period 2006-2008, but following this 
would allow international consortia to make other 
arrangements in cooperation with local partners.  (Note: 
Using VoIP for computer-to-computer communications has long 
been legal, but VoIP over telephones has remained illegal 
despite increasing use of the technology among Egyptians. 
End note.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Rumors continue to circulate on who will be the 
favored candidate to obtain the third license, the assumption 
being that the GOE will mold the RFP to suit its preferred 
candidate.  A panel discussion left the impression that NTRA 
would tailor the RFP for TE.  This impression has made its 
way into the local press, which reports that TE is already 
arranging to sell its stake in current mobile provider 
Vodafone in order to be free to pursue the third license (see 
reftel).  An industry contact stated that TE would form a 
consortium with Emirates Telecommunications Corporation 
(Eitesalat) and a company belonging to the late Anwar Sadat's 
son Gamal (El Mashrek Co.) for this purpose, and that - upon 
learning of MCIT's preference for TE - a consortium from 
India that had planned to bid had just cancelled a trip to 
Cairo.  However, another industry contact claimed he was 
forming a consortium between his local firm and U.S. firms 
Nextel and Sprint to participate in the RFP, and that the 
group might seek advocacy support from the Embassy.
