SUBJECT: HIGH-LEVEL SPANISH GOVERNMENT PARTICIPATION IN 
WIREC UNLIKELY DUE TO ELECTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 138428 
 
Post has discussed WIREC with contacts in the Ministry Of 
Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and 
Trade.  National elections are expected to take place March 2 
or March 9, 2008, and our interlocutors say that as a result, 
participation in WIREC March 4-6 by senior GOS officials is 
unlikely.  Post will continue to discuss WIREC opportunities 
with GOS officials and the private sector representatives in 
the coming weeks and will provide septel a list of businesses 
that we believe may be interested in participating.
