Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU)  During the last five months, Abu Shouk - a 54,000 
internally displaced person (IDP) camp on the outskirts of El 
Fasher, North Darfur - has been the scene of ethnic tension and 
clashes.  Between November 12 and 15, UN agencies and 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) suspended humanitarian 
activities in the camp due to increased tension and clashes 
following the visit of Minni Minawi, leader of the Sudan Liberation 
Army (SLA) faction that signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA). 
While the camp's humanitarian situation is now stable, the 
international community fears that the camp may become a place where 
the Fur and Zaghawa ethnic groups settle their differences on the 
DPA.  The USAID Darfur Field Office (USAID/DFO) notes that Abu Shouk 
camp is adequately served, with more than 17 UN agencies and NGOs 
covering life-saving sectors, including food, shelter, emergency 
relief supplies, water, sanitation, hygiene, health, and nutrition, 
as well as other sectors such as education, agriculture, 
livelihoods, and protection.  End summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Key Dates in Abu Shouk since May 2006 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Since the signing of the DPA in May 2006, tension between the 
80 percent Fur and 20 percent Zaghawa ethnic groups in Abu Shouk has 
increased significantly, impacting the work and presence of UN 
agencies and NGOs in the camp.  Zaghawa community leaders accuse Fur 
leaders of dominating discussions and not letting their voice be 
heard on issues related to peace, return, and DPA implementation. 
This tension is most visible at water points, food distribution 
areas, and community centers, as well as during high-level visits. 
 
 
¶3. (U) In May 2006, IDPs in Abu Shouk held a series of 
demonstrations against the DPA.  The African Union Mission in Sudan 
(AMIS) Civilian Police (CIVPOL) compound in the camp was damaged 
during the demonstrations, resulting in the suspension of all AMIS 
activities, including patrols in and around the camp. 
 
¶4. (U) In July and August, following Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) 
attacks and clashes between SLA factions in Korma - approximately 70 
km northwest of El Fasher - Abu Shouk's umdas and sheikhs 
(traditional leaders) reported the presence of armed elements inside 
the camp. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On October 23, the Wali (Governor) of North Darfur 
attempted to attend the Eid prayer in Abu Shouk after being invited 
by one of the IDPs' umdas, who is close to the Sudanese government. 
When the Wali arrived, the IDPs became angry and threw rocks at the 
Wali's motorcade.  The Wali immediately departed Abu Shouk, and 
later the IDPs beat and injured the umda who had invited the Wali. 
The UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) reported that all 18 umdas from Abu 
Shouk camp were summoned to the Wali's residence on October 24.  The 
Wali accused the umdas of mobilizing the IDPs against the State 
Government and supporting UN Security Council Resolution 1706 and 
armed opposition groups.  The Wali indicated that the umdas' 
activities would be monitored and that security measures would be 
reinforced in the camp to maintain state sovereignty.  The umdas 
expressed concern to UNMIS that the Sudanese government's National 
Intelligence and Security Service agents would follow them and 
requested that the UN provide protection from harassment. 
 
----------------- 
Current Situation 
----------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Tensions between the pro-DPA Zaghawa and anti-DPA Fur IDPs 
have increased significantly since Minni Minawi's visit to El Fasher 
on November 9.  After participating in a rally for Minawi in town, 
three SLA/Minni Minawi supporters were injured at the camp.  On 
November 11, the UN designated Abu Shouk a "no go" area for UN 
agencies and advised NGOs to avoid the camp.  The UN Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) officially requested 
that all NGOs and UN agencies avoid taking delegations to the camp. 
On November 12, clashes between Zaghawa and Fur IDPs erupted in the 
 
KHARTOUM 00002721  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
camp.  Later the same day, Abu Shouk IDP community leaders told the 
NGO camp coordinator, Spanish Red Cross (SpRC), that the IDPs did 
not want UN or NGO presence in the camp.  As a result, AMIS CIVPOL 
suspended patrols in the camp. 
 
¶7. (U) On November 15, the UN lifted the "no go" designation for UN 
agencies working in Abu Shouk camp.  According to the USAID/DFO, UN 
sources report that the ongoing situation in the camp is political 
and should not impact international humanitarian work and presence 
in the camp.  In addition, only a small minority of umdas and 
sheikhs now reportedly opposes the humanitarian community presence 
in the camp.  Fur and Zaghawa umdas and sheikhs reportedly have held 
two meetings - one on November 14 and the other on November 16 - in 
the camp; however, no information on issues discussed or agreements 
reached has been reported.

Abu Shouk Camp Profile and Facts at a Glance 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) Located 2 miles northwest of El Fasher town, Abu Shouk is a 
vibrant camp with a dynamic population engaged in livelihoods and 
trade activities.  The camp provides daily laborers for most 
temporary jobs in the camp and in the nearby town.  Access from Abu 
Shouk to El Fasher is easy; there are no check points and taxis move 
with no difficulties between the camp and the town. 
 
¶9. (U) IDPs in Abu Shouk are well served.  SpRC coordinates all 
humanitarian activities in the camp and liaises with the sheikhs and 
umdas, relief agencies, AMIS CIVPOL, and external actors. 
Currently, the camp has over 17 UN agencies and INGOs providing the 
following humanitarian services: 
 
A) Food aid:  the UN World Food Program (WFP) and Sudanese Red 
Crescent Society (SRCS) distribute a monthly ration to 54,043 
persons; 
 
B) Nutrition:  the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and Action Contre la 
Faim (ACF) treat 1,525 children in the camp in therapeutic feeding 
centers; 
 
C) Health:  USAID partner International Rescue Committee (IRC), 
Partner Aid International (PAI), the Egyptian military hospital, and 
the German Red Cross operate four primary health care clinics.  The 
UN World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF provide essential 
drugs to ensure IDPs have free access to health services; 
 
D) Water and sanitation:  the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC), OXFAM/UK, UNICEF, and the Government of National 
Unity's (GNU) Office of Water and Environmental Sanitation (WES) 
provide between 11 and 12 liters of water per day per person.  In 
addition, 2,178 latrines and 1,382 bathing units - 6 latrines and 3 
bathing units per residential block - are operational in the camp; 
 
 
E) Shelter and Emergency Relief Supplies:  IRC, OXFAM, ICRC, SpRC, 
SRCS, and the UN Joint Logistics Center (UNJLC) coordinate the 
distribution of shelter materials, soap, blankets, and mosquito nets 
to supplement existing emergency relief supplies as required; 
 
F) Livelihoods:  USAID partner CHF International trains 120 
beneficiaries - mostly women - each month on income-generating 
activities, including pasta making and traditional goods and 
handicraft production.  In September and October, the UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO) supported the vaccination of 4,628 
heads of livestock owned by IDPs; 
 
G) Protection:  the UN Development Program (UNDP), UN Population 
Fund (UNFPA), UNMIS Protection Unit, UNICEF, IRC, and CHF are all 
engaged in advocacy with North Darfur State governmental 
authorities.  NGOs deal mainly with protection activities and 
provision of legal and justice support.  CHF supports a 
fuel-efficient stoves program, which helps reduce the amount of time 
spent collecting household fuel, lessening the exposure of women to 
attack when collecting wood; and 
 
H) Education: UNICEF, IRC, CHF, and Enfants du Monde helped enroll 
13,769 children for the 2006 school year.  Save the Children/Sweden 
is engaged in primary education activities in the camp.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) While the humanitarian situation in Abu Shouk is now 
stable, the humanitarian community fears that relief activities will 
be disrupted again as the camp becomes the stage for the Fur and 
Zaghawa groups to play out their differences on the DPA.  End 
comment.
