¶1.  SUMMARY: IN RECENT DAYS POST HAS RAISED THE POINTS 
IN REF B AT VARIOUS LEVELS WITHIN THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT. 
OUR INTERLOCUTORS INFORM US THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR AUSTRIA 
TO MEET THE OCTOBER 26 DEADLINE.  THE AUSTRIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER BELIEVES THIS ISSUE WILL BECOME A MAJOR SOURCE OF 
TENSION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND AUSTRIA DURING AUSTRIA'S 
PRESIDENCY OF THE EU.  POST IS REPORTING ON RESOURCE 
NEEDS AND STRATEGIES FOR COPING WITH THE INCREASED 
WORKLOAD AS REQUESTED IN REF B BY SEPTEL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  POST HAS RAISED THE POINTS IN REF B AT VARIOUS 
LEVELS IN RECENT DAYS.  THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH AUSTRIAN 
FOREIGN MINISTER PLASSNIK ON SEPT. 7 AND UNDERSCORED THE 
LOOMING ISSUE.  THE MINISTER EXPRESSED HER UNHAPPINESS WITH 
THIS SITUATION AND SAID IT WOULD BE COME A MAJOR STRESS 
POINT WITH THE U.S. DURING AUSTRIA'S PRESIDENCY OF THE EU 
IN 2006.  SHE IS LIKELY TO RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH THE SECRETARY 
DURING HER UPCOMING VISIT TO WASHINGTON ON SEPTEMBER 9. 
 
¶3.  POST ALSO RAISED THE MATTER WITH THE MFA'S HEAD OF 
CONSULAR AND LEGAL AFFAIRS, AND WITH THE MOI'S BIOMETRIC 
PASSPORT PROGRAM COORDINATOR.  ALL OFFICIALS INFORMED 
US THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR AUSTRIA TO ACCELERATE ISSUANCE OF 
A DIGITAL PASSPORT.  INSTEAD, AUSTRIA INTENDS TO AIM FOR 
LEVEL II COMPLIANCE AS OF LATE SPRING OR EARLY SUMMER IN 2006 
(TARGET: MAY 2006) WHEN IT WILL BEGIN CENTRALIZED ISSUANCE OF 
FULLY ICAO-COMPLAINT BIOMETRIC PASSPORTS.  THE MOI IS AWARE THAT 
AUSTRIA WILL MISS THE DEADLINE AND IS RECOMMENDING ON ITS 
PASSPORT WEBSITE THAT AUSTRIAN CITIZENS OBTAIN NEW 
PASSPORT BEFORE OCT. 26. 
 
¶4. POST HAS URGED THE GOA TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO ENCOURAGE 
TRAVELERS TO OBTAIN PASSPORTS BEFORE THE DEADLINE.  WE HAVE 
ALSO ASSURED THE GOA THAT WE ARE TAKING STEPS TO COPE WITH 
THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN VISA APPLICATIONS BY TRAVELERS 
WITH PASSPORTS ISSUED AFTER THE DEADLINE (SEPTEL). 
 
¶5. THE COUNTRY TEAM, INCLUDING PD AND FCS, WILL CONDUCT 
OUTREACH TO INFORM THE TRAVEL COMMUNITY OF THE NEW REQUIREMENT. 
WE NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT STAFFING SHORTAGES IN THE CONSULAR SECTION 
(REF D) WILL MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE CONSULAR STAFF TO ENGAGE FULLY 
POST URGES THE DEPARTMENT TO SEND TDY ASSISTANCE REQUESTED (SEPTEL) 
BEFORE THE ACTUAL DEADLINE TO ASSIST WITH OUTREACH.
