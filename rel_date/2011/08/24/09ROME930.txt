SUBJECT: ITALY: DONOR SUPPORT FOR THE SOMALIA TFG 
 
REF: STATE 79853 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Poloff delivered demarche seeking donor 
support for the Somalia Transitional Federal Government (TFG) 
following the agreement with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) to 
MFA East Africa Office Director Giuseppe Pastorelli.  He 
emphasized the GOI's continuing commitment to achieving 
stability in the region and highlighted the recent pledge 
made at the Brussels Donors Conference.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Honoring its four million euro pledge in Brussels, 
Italy has disbursed two million euros for Somali security 
forces and two million euros for AMISOM which goes through 
the African Union.  There are two programs for the training 
of Somali security forces: one for the Somali police and one 
for the Somali coast guard.  A training center is to be 
located in Africa, most likely in Kenya, possibly in Egypt. 
The Italian Carabinieri branch of the armed forces will be 
responsible for the operation of the training center and the 
MFA "will cover the financial burden."  Further details are 
pending. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The GOI pledged an additional three million euros at 
the International Contact Group on Somalia meeting in Rome on 
June 10.  Two million euros of this pledge is awaiting 
disbursement with "the bulk going to fund the African Union 
efforts in the region." 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Italian Development Cooperation has committed 
eight million euros in aid plus an unspecified amount through 
emergency channels according to Mr. Pastorelli. 
 
Funding Mechanism 
----------------- 
¶5. (U) Mr. Pastorelli was not aware if the agreement with PWC 
has altered the financial mechanism through which the GOI has 
disbursed funds but said he would investigate the issue. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: These figures do not appear to account for 
the totality of funds dedicated to Somalia.  In a separate 
meeting, the MFA used the figure of 13 million euros as total 
support to "Somali institutions and the peace process." 
Because the above paragraphs outline a commitment of  more 
than 15 million euros, there remains a discrepancy of at 
least two million euros.  Post will seek to provide clarity 
on the cited figures.
