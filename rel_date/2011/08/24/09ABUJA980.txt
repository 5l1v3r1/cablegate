SUBJECT: ATTORNEY GENERAL AGREES TO ASSIGNMENT OF TDY DEA NARCOTICS 
ADVISOR TO NDLEA 
 
Ref:  Sanders-Silski-Piascik emails of February 24-25, 2009 
 
¶1.  This is an action request.  See paras 3 and 4 and 6. 
 
¶2. Post wishes to report the receipt of Diplomatic Note number 
M.679/2009 from the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
acknowledging that the Attorney General and Minister of Justice of 
the Federal Republic of Nigeria approves the deployment of a U.S. 
narcotics advisor that will be attached to the National Drug Law 
Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for a period of six months. The 
Diplomatic Note encourages post to make further arrangements to 
effect the deployment of the advisor to the NDLEA for the purpose of 
strengthening its capacity to investigate and prosecute major drug 
traffickers.  Text of diplomatic note follows at para 6. 
 
¶3.  Action request:  As a first step, Mission requests that INL and 
DEA begin the process of identifying narcotics advisor. The advisor 
will be located at the NDLEA offices in Lagos, Nigeria. The advisor 
would serve under a Personal Services Contract (PSC) on a TDY basis 
for a period of 6 months.  Identifying someone early will allow us 
to move more quickly once the scope of work is agreed to with the 
Attorney General. 
 
¶4.  Action request continued: At the same time, post requests 
INL/AAE draft a new Letter of Agreement (LOA) with the Government of 
Nigeria (GON). The LOA should specify the broad contours of the 
activities for the advisor, and should include assistance on 
investigation and prosecution of major drug traffickers as well as 
strengthening interdiction activities at seaports and borders.  The 
LOA should clearly indicate that NDLEA and other Government of 
Nigeria entities will ensure appropriate access to GON officials and 
agencies.  NDLEA should also be responsible for supplying adequate 
office space in a location that will facilitate maximum interaction 
with relevant officers. 
 
¶5. As a PSC, this individual will be signed up for the basic ICASS 
package (CLO and Health Unit are mandatory), motorpool and security 
services. 
 
¶6.  Action request: Post requests that funding for the advisor's 
ICASS costs reflect FY 2010 PD&S costs, as INL ICASS costs (to be 
provided separately) cannot be paid from project funds but only with 
PD&S funds. ICASS costs will be billed through the TDY module. In 
addition to ICASS costs, funding will be required for operational 
support costs such as lodging and field travel. Post looks forward 
to receiving resources as noted above to fund the NDLEA Advisor 
position. 
 
¶7. Text of Diplomatic Note: 
 
Note No...M.679/2009......... 
 
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States of 
America and has the honour to acknowledge its letter to the Attorney 
General and Minister of Justice of the Federation and to inform the 
esteemed Embassy that the government of the Federal Republic of 
Nigeria is well disposed to the attachment of an advisor from the 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to the Nigerian Drug Law 
Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for a period of six months. 
 
 The Embassy may therefore wish to proceed with further discussion 
and arrangements to effect its proposal which the Ministry believes 
has the potential to strengthen NDLEA's capacity to investigate and 
prosecute major drug traffickers. 
 
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 
avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the 
United States of America the assurances of its highest 
consideration.
