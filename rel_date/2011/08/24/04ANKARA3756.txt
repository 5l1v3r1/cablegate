     ¶C. MAY 28 2004 EMAIL FROM TIMOTHY BARRY TO HAROLD 
        BONACQUIST 
 
¶1. With respect to the additional information requested in 
Ref A, Post advises as follows: 
 
¶2. All of the 45 vehicles provided to the TMO between 1989-93 
remain operational. They are used for poppy planting control 
throughout Turkey. 
 
¶3. Regarding the request for information concerning 
"communications equipment/radios in use by the projects," 
Post is advised by its local partners as follows: 
 
-- TMO reports no communications equipment provided by U.S. 
 
-- Customs reports 5 Motorola radio-sets and chargers, 
provided in 1999. The radios are currently being used in the 
training of narcotics sniffer-dogs and train-the-trainer 
programs being held in Golbasi National Dog Training Center 
of TNP. 
 
-- AMATEM reports a DX-2B telephone switchboard and related 
technical equipment together with 50 phone machines, provided 
in 2003. The system is in operation and is used for the 
communication of the staff and patients within AMATEM section 
of Bakirkoy Hospital. 
 
-- Jandarma report 2 transmitter cigarette packets, 2 
transmitter calendar books, one hidden transmitter, 10 Yaesu 
hand-radios, 2 AID-Unitel-3000 voice and image transmitter 
systems, one Panasonic digital closed circuit camera, all of 
which are currently active. The Anti-Smuggling and Organized 
Crime Department of Jandarma uses these in intelligence works 
and operations on narcotic issues. A voice transmitter via 
GSM is malfunctioning. 
 
-- TNP had provided Post with a 39 page inventory of all 
equipment provided under the INL equipment, including but not 
limited to communications equipment, showing the location of 
each individual item of equipment. TNP reports that 2-3% of 
communications equipment is repaired annually and that all 
remains operational. 
 
Note that, for 2004, Post will audit communications equipment 
in accordance with procedures described in Ref C. 
 
¶4. The direct narcotics interdiction impact of the INL-funded 
resources is difficult to calculate. However, in 2003, 
Turkish law enforcement agencies seized 4,705 kilos of 
heroin, 1,009 kilos of morphine base, 7,812 kilos of hashish, 
10,129 kilos of acetic anhydrite, 2.8 kilograms of cocaine 
and 5,867,510 pills; destroyed 7 illicit labs; and made 
10,223 drug-related arrests. (Note: These figures update 
through year-end the figures provided in Ref B.) Turkish law 
enforcement agencies and DEA officials indicate that 
INL-funded resources materially aided these Turkish narcotics 
interdiction efforts.
