SUBJECT:  ZIMBABWE:  1994 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  A) STATE 286744  B) STATE 298865 
 
¶1.  FORMAT PER REFTEL: 
 
(A) PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM: 
 
THERE WERE NO TERRORIST INCIDENTS OR TERRORIST 
RELATED PROSECUTIONS IN ZIMBABWE IN 1994. 
 
(B) EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: 
 
THERE WERE NO CASES INVOLVING EXTRADITION OF 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN ZIMBABWE IN 1994. 
 
(C) IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS: 
 
THE CURRENT ABSENCE OF EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH 
THE US IS THE ONLY IDENTIFIABLE IMPEDIMENT TO 
PROSECUTION OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
HOWEVER, FUNCTIONING (THOUGH UNRATIFIED) BORDER 
REPATRIATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND 
OUR RELATIVELY SMOOTH BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS WHICH 
SHOULD RESULT IN A SIGNED EXTRADITION TREATY BY MAY 
1995, INDICATE ZIMBABWE WOULD ACT RESPONSIBLY IN A 
CASE INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
¶D. HOST COUNTRY RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION: 
 
ZIMBABWE OFFERED NO OFFICIAL STATEMENTS AND TOOK NO 
SPECIFIC ACTION IN RESPONSE TO TERRORISM IN 1994. 
 
¶E. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 1994: 
 
ZIMBABWE UNDERTOOK NO MAJOR COUNTERTERRORIST 
EFFORTS THIS YEAR. 
 
¶F. SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM: 
 
THOUGH ZIMBABWE MAINTAINS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH 
THE SEVEN COUNTRIES IDENTIFIED AS SPONSORING 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM (LIBYA, NORTH KOREA, IRAN 
AND SUDAN MAINTAIN MISSIONS IN HARARE), THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE SUPPORTS OR 
CONDONES TERRORIST ACTS PERPETRATED BY THESE 
COUNTRIES. 
 
¶G. PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM: 
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE ISSUED NO STATEMENTS IN 
SUPPORT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES IN 1994. 
 
¶H. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDE TOWARDS 
TERRORISM SINCE 1993: 
 
IN RECENT YEARS THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE HAS BEEN 
GENERALLY COOPERATIVE IN ITS APPROACH TO MATTERS OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM -- PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE 
IS A PERCEIVED NATIONAL INTEREST.  THERE IS NO 
REASON TO BELIEVE ZIMBABWEAN ATTITUDE TOWARDS 
TERRORISM HAS CHANGED IN THE PAST YEAR.
