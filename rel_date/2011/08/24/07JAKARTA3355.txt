Environment Facility (GEF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and 
NGOs, including the World Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy and

commitment to this initiative and announced our intention to commit

expertise and hinted at future additional development assistance. 
GEF CEO Monique Barbut said the GEF is ready to embrace the CTI, 
describing intentions to earmark $9.0 million and to help leverage 
other contributions to create additional resources. ADB committed $2 
million for start-up costs over the next twelve months.   The NGOs

Summary. 
 
CTI Country Delegations Well Prepared 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. On December 6, Indonesia hosted a closed session senior officials 
meeting of the six CTI countries. This was the first time the 
countries had met to discuss the CTI.  Dr. Charles Vernon, former 
Chief Scientist of the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences and 
Jose Ma Lorenzo Tan from World Wildlife Fund Philippines provided 
expert counsel to the delegations.  Observers included 
representatives from World Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy, 
Conservation International, and the Government of Pulau. 
 
¶3. According to NGO observers, all CTI countries delegations came 
well prepared for the meeting and provided excellent country 
presentations. NGOs characterized the discussions as productive and 
constructive.   Although senior officials from the delegations had 
different expectations for the meetings and different authority 
levels for making commitments, delegations quickly reached consensus 
They met their objectives, including establishing a common 
understanding for CTI,  creating guiding principles, actions, and 
committing to establishing a CTI plan for action.  Participants 
agreed to form a technical working group and discussed the 
possibility of holding a follow-on Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) in 
the Philippines in May 2008. They also agreed that Indonesia would 
continue to provisionally host the CTI Secretariat and that the 
World Oceans Conference in May 2009 might be a potential venue for 
hosting a CTI Summit.  On December 7, Chairman Professor Dr. Syamsul 
Maarif (Director General for Marine, Coastal and Small Island 
Affairs from the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs) reconvened 
the meeting.  CTI delegations agreed to adopt the draft Chairman's 
Summary as the summary of the First Senior Officials Meeting. 
 
 
 
Other Delegations Pledge Funding, Expertise 
------------------------------------------- 
¶4.  Chairman Maarif opened the December 7 CTI Consultation meeting 
with a short film on CTI. The Philippine Delegation provided an 
overview and shared outcomes from the December 6 meeting with all 
parties.  The Chairman then invited the United States, Australia, 
the GEF, the ADB and NGOs to make presentations. 
 
¶5. The US Delegation stressed President Bush's commitment to the CTI 
initiative and announced the USG intention to provide $4.35 million 
in funding to support the efforts of CTI partners. The funds would 
be in addition to the ongoing efforts of U.S. agencies like NOAA and 
USAID. The delegation also outlined USG involvement in oceans and 
coastal management, including recent activities and initiatives like 
the creation of the National Marine Monument in the Northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands, the Marine Debris Initiative and efforts to 
strengthen fisheries management.  The US Delegation included Gerhard 
Kuska, Council on Environmental Quality; Dan Reifsnyder, Department 
of State; and Alfred Nakatsuma, USAID.

¶6. The Australian delegation emphasized technical expertise and 
lessons learned from managing the Great Barrier Reef national park 
since its establishment in 1975.  The delegation stressed the 
contributions that Marine Protected Areas can make toward both 
biodiversity and community development   Although not specifying 
funding toward the CTI, the Australian delegation noted that the new 
Australian administration planned to increase development assistance 
to 0.5 percent of GNP, with much of this to be devoted to 
environmental and climate change issues. Australia hinted that the 
CTI and CTI countries are likely to benefit from this increased 
assistance. 
 
¶7. GEF, ADB and NGOs also presented at the meeting.  GEF expressed 
commitment to the CTI and noted that GEF would like to play a 
central role in facilitating funding for this effort.  GEF is able 
to leverage financial contributions at a ratio of 1:4.  New Zealand, 
China and France have already expressed interest in CTI. GEF 
indicated that the Asian Development Bank would likely be the lead 
GEF agency. ADB pledged $2 million for start-up over the next twelve 
months.  The NGO delegation pledged $500,000 for immediate 
stakeholder consultation for the six countries and commitment to 
draw on networks and private philanthropy for additional 
contributions. 
 
¶8. The meeting closed with the Chairman noting that President 
Yudhoyono would host a December 10 meeting with Delegation heads 
followed by a press conference.  The chairman summarized that CTI 
countries are looking for assistance with financial support to 
develop and implement an action plan, technical and scientific 
expertise, technical inputs to the action plan, financial support at 
the ground level once plans are developed and the establishment of a 
trust fund.
