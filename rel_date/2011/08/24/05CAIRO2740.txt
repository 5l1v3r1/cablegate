¶1.  (SBU)  Post appreciates ref A opportunity to consider how 
public diplomacy might raise awareness of the Proliferation 
Security Initiative (PSI) in Egypt.  Egypt is an influential 
leader in the non-proliferation (NP) community and Egyptian 
experts hold unequaled sway in international fora.  While 
Egypt and the U.S. share many strategic goals in the NP 
arena, Egypt often takes positions sympathetic to the 
nonaligned movement or other "non-Western" groupings which do 
not necessarily endorse USG initiatives and tactics.  The 
U.S. and Egypt share many of the objectives of the PSI, for 
example, yet Egypt has yet to express formal support or 
become an active participant. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Public awareness of non-proliferation issues is 
very low in Egypt, with initiatives like the PSI gaining 
little resonance with a population focused on other concerns. 
 The PSI is familiar to NP specialists, however, and an 
effective communication effort really should center around 
those at the MFA or strategic think tanks who focus 
professionally on non-proliferation.  This objective is best 
accomplished in face-to-face meetings during the visits of 
senior USG officials or U.S. experts in the field.  The best 
approach to reaching the broader public is to influence the 
perceptions of recognized Egyptian experts who contribute to 
domestic publications (both specialized and mass 
distribution) and appear in the Arab media. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Post recommends deepening our NP dialogue with 
Egyptian experts, as articulated reftels (refs E and F in 
particular), through visits by senior USG officials.  A 
helpful alternative would be a recognized U.S. expert (such 
as Robert Einhorn, who visited Egypt on CSIS business in 
2002, ref I).  The IIP speaker program could be used to 
support such a visit, if needed, but the expert would need to 
have recognized international stature and credibility on NP 
issues.  Programming during any such visit should include 
both GOE and academic audiences, with PSI being one of 
multiple issues discussed.  Many of the points made in 
paragraph 18 of ref A could most effectively be conveyed to 
Egyptian audiences during direct discussions in Cairo. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Egypt is looking for enhanced USG recognition of 
its influential role in the NP arena.  A visit designed to 
acknowledge that role, as well as boost appreciation for U.S. 
approaches to our common NP goals, would go a long way toward 
encouraging greater GOE support for PSI.
