SUBJECT: REPORT ON FISCAL TRANSPARENCY IN ISRAEL 
 
REF: STATE 16737 
 
¶1.  (U) The Government of Israel is a parliamentary democracy 
with all of the mechanisms of checks and balances associated 
with this form of government.  This includes an active 
opposition bloc with procedural remedies at its disposal. 
Israel also has an inquisitive, open civil society with a 
free press, active civil organizations, and numerous interest 
groups. 
 
¶2.  (U) The budget procedure, within the larger context of 
Israel's commitment to democracy, is and can be expected to 
remain transparent.  The budget is available on the internet 
from the date it is first proposed through its final passage 
in the Knesset.  The final version is also published in book 
form.  Monthly updates on revenues and expenditures are also 
published on the internet, and the figures are meaningful and 
accurate. 
 
¶3.  (U) There are no particular U.S. Government-sponsored 
activities that promote fiscal transparency.  However, the 
U.S. and Israel meet once a year at the Joint Economic 
Development Group (JEDG) to discuss Israel's economy in the 
context of Israel's fiscal and economic commitments to the 
U.S. under the 2003 U.S.-Israel Loan Guarantee Agreement. 
During those meetings, the issue of fiscal transparency is 
discussed.  A continued Israeli commitment to maintaining an 
open budget and expenditure process remains one of the 
conditions Israel must fulfill to continue to receive U.S. 
loan guarantees under the program. 
 
¶4.  (U) No other country or multilateral institution provides 
assistance in the area of fiscal transparency.  However, 
organizations such as the IMF do come to Israel to analyze 
and report on the economic situation, and also comment on 
ways Israel can enhance its fiscal transparency and 
governance.
