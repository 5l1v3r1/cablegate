REF: SECSTATE 126694 
 
¶1. (SBU) Maren Lipps, Pakistan Desk Officer, Germany Ministry 
of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), told Econoff 
that Germany shares U.S. concerns about the World Food 
Program's (WFP's) need for assistance in Pakistan to cover 
its forecasted shortfall of resources.  She said there was a 
possibility the German government might be able to provide 
new funds before the end of this year, though no decision had 
yet been taken.  Many decisions are still "in the air," she 
explained, due to the arrival of new Development Minister 
Dirk Niebel.  Lipps is "hopeful" some assistance will be made 
available "in coming weeks."  (NOTE: German assistance to 
Pakistan, including funding via WFP and UNHCR for internally 
displaced persons (IDPs), totals 141 million euros in 
2009-2010.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Reftel points were also shared with contacts at the 
Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Food, Agriculture and 
Consumer Protection.  Post will report any new information 
via septel.
