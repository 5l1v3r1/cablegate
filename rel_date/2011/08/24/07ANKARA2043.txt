¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) During the August 1-7, 2007 reporting period, seven GOT 
security officials were killed, six during clashes with PKK 
terrorists and one when a land mine exploded.  An additional eight 
security officials were wounded in land mine explosions. 
 
¶3. (U) In the same period, 14 PKK terrorists were killed in action 
and three were captured. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported five clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in Turkey's southeastern region during the 
reporting period.  Security forces discovered seven PKK 
shelters/caves and seized booby-trapped land mines; other 
explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; 
hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite 
antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. (U) On August 4, a villager was kidnapped by the PKK and then 
killed in Gurpinar, Van Province. 
 
¶6. (U) On August 6, the PKK released eight villagers that it had 
kidnapped on July 31 in Baskale, Van Province. 
 
¶7. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
