REF:  TALLINN 693 
 
¶1. (U) On December 19, the 101 member Estonian 
Parliament (Riigikogu) voted to extend the mandate for 
the Estonian troop deployment in Iraq by 12 months 
(until December 31, 2008).  53 MPs voted in favor of the 
bill, which followed quickly on the heels of the 
December 18 UNSC vote to extend the mandate of the 
multinational forces in Iraq.  Most MPs from the ruling 
coalition (Reform, IRL and Social Democrats) voted in 
favor of the bill while members of the opposition 
(Center, Greens and People's Union) primarily voted 
against or did not vote at all.  The Speaker of 
Parliament signed the bill into law at the same session. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Parliament's approval re-authorizes up to 40 
troops to participate in the mission.  At the moment 
Estonia has a total of 38 military personnel serving in 
Iraq.  34 infantry troops (ESTPLA-16) are assigned to 
the U.S. 1st Calvary Division near Baghdad and 4 staff 
officers serve at the headquarters of the multinational 
brigade and in the NATO training mission. 
 
¶3. (SBU) At a holiday reception just before debate on 
the Iraq bill began in the Parliament, Prime Minister 
Ansip underscored his strong support for Estonia's role 
in Iraq and made a point of telling Ambassador that 
Estonia would 'stand by the United States all over the 
world.' 
 
¶4. (U) During the month of December, the Riigikogu also 
voted to extend the mandates for Estonian troop 
participation in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
Kosovo (all until December 31, 2008).  The extension of 
the Afghanistan mission (69 votes in favor, none 
opposed) continued authorization for the participation 
of up to 150 Estonian soldiers in the NATO-led 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The bill 
on Bosnia and Herzegovina (74 votes in favor, none 
opposed) allows for the participation of 5 soldiers in 
the regional peace keeping operation.  This is a 
decrease in the size of the allowed contingent from 35 
to 5.  However, it more accurately reflects the actual 
number of troops Estonia has deployed on the ground (3 
since June).  The Kosovo bill (80 votes in favor, none 
opposed) re-authorized the deployment of up to 40 troops 
with the NATO-led KFOR force.  Finally, this month, the 
Parliament also approved the participation of 55 
Estonian troops in the EU Nordic Battle Group (81 votes 
in favor, none opposed).  (Note: The final decision on 
whether and where the force will be deployed is made by 
the European Council. End Note).
