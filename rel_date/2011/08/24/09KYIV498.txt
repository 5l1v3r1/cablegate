Mail Delivered 
-------------- 
¶1.  (SBU) Embassy delivered Ref B and Ref C points jointly 
with Anatoliy Sirotyuk of the Russian Embassy to Oleh 
Klynchenko at Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on 
March 18.  Klynchenko, who heads the MFA's Political Planning 
Division, said that Ukraine hoped to send up to two 
representatives to Seoul for the Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) workshop and Exercise Planning 
Group (EPG) in April, but it lacked funding.  He said that as 
a last resort, Ukraine's Ambassador to Korea would attend the 
EPG. 
 
Money scarce, but intention firm 
-------------------------------- 
¶2.  (SBU) Klynchenko confirmed that Ukraine's State Border 
Guard Service (SBGS) had requested USG funding though the 
Embassy's EXBS program advisor to send one employee to Seoul. 
  In a separate conversation, Post's EXBS confirmed it 
supported the SBGS request and that it was waiting on final 
approval. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Klynchenko explained that the GOU would not send 
representatives to the GICNT meeting in Garmisch, Germany in 
April (Ref A).  However, he said that Ukraine was committed 
to participating in all major GICNT events even if it could 
not attend every meeting.  He emphasized, however, that the 
lack funding would remain an obstacle in the foreseeable 
future. 
 
Korean Embassy Not Instructed 
----------------------------- 
¶4.  (SBU) Embassy met with Minister Counselor Jae-Han Koo of 
the Embassy of Korea about the joint demarche, who explained 
that he had not been informed by his Government about the 
GICNT event in Seoul.  He said he was not available to 
deliver the demarche jointly but asked to be informed of the 
GOU response.  Despite Ref B concerns, the Russian Embassy 
was very responsive our request to participate in this and a 
previous joint GICNT demarche.
