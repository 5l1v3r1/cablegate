SUBJECT: MIDDLE EAST: ARABS PUSHING UNSC RESOLUTION ON 
ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS 
 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) USUN has learned that the Arab Group at the UN met 
at the expert-level on June 11 to discuss a Saudi proposal to 
table a draft resolution in the UN Security Council 
criticizing recent Israeli settlement activity.  According to 
friendly delegations in the Arab Group, the Palestinian 
Observer Mission presented several amendments to the 
Saudi-drafted text during the June 11 meeting, which were 
generally welcomed by the group.  The Libyan delegation plans 
to circulate a revised text to the Arab Group on June 12. 
(Note: USUN will forward the draft to the Department once we 
receive it.  End Note.)  If Arab capitals approve the text on 
June 12 or June 13, Arab PermReps in New York are expected to 
approach Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) members of the UNSC to 
seek their support for the draft (this would include South 
Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, Panama, and Burkina Faso).  If 
the NAM Council members support the draft text, which USUN 
assesses as likely, the Arabs are expected to then approach 
European members of the Council to attain the required nine 
votes.  Word of this draft resolution has already spread 
across UN missions in New York.  Arab diplomats friendly to 
USUN expect the resolution to be tabled in the Security 
Council, with at least the requisite nine votes in support, 
by the middle of next week (June 18) at the latest.
