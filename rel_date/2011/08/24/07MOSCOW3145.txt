SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: PRE-LICENSE CHECK: DMITROVSKY 
ELECTRICITY NETWORK, DMITROV, RUSSIA, D373937 
 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Dmitrovsky Electricity network, Dmitrov, Russia. The 
company is listed on BIS license application D373937 
as the ultimate consignee of thermal imager, model 
¶1100. These items are controlled for national security 
and nuclear non-proliferation reasons under ECCN 
6A003. The licensee is Mikron Infrared, Inc., 16 
Thornton Road, Oakland, NJ 07436. 
 
¶3. On June 22, 2007, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted a pre- 
license check at the offices of Dmitrovsky Electricity 
Network (Russian abbreviation DES), 46, Kosmonavtov 
st., Dmitrov, Russia. The export control team met with 
Vladimir Petrov, Chief Engineer. 
 
¶4. DES is part of the Moscow Regional Electrical 
Company (Russian abbreviation MOESK), a group of 13 
affiliated power companies formed from the 
reorganization of MosEnergo.  DES was founded 40 years 
ago to provide electrical power generation and 
distribution services to the Dmitrovsky Region, 
located about 60 kilometers northwest of Moscow.  DES 
is an Open Joint Stock company, with 52% government 
ownership. DES employs 467, and maintains 32 
substations in the region as well as transmission and 
distribution lines. Currently DES is working with its 
MOESK affiliates in a major overhaul program to 
improve the regional power grid.  An investment of 
approximately 45 Billion Russian Rubles is being used 
to improve infrastructure, build and improve 
substations and distribution lines. 
 
¶5. The Department of Electrical Isolation will use the 
thermal imager described in reftel for preventative 
maintenance and non-destructive testing of lines and 
transformers.  Three specialists will be trained at 
the Bauman Moscow State Technical University. 
Currently all thermal imaging is done through 
contractors, which is not cost effective.  Providing 
thermal-imaging services in-house is more efficient, 
less expensive in the long run. 
 
¶6. The Chief of the Electrical Isolation Services 
department will be responsible for the imager, and 
will issue the unit to crews on an as-needed basis. 
The imager will be stored in a safe in the Chief's 
office at the Dmitrovsky headquarters of DES.  The 
building is on the grounds of the power station, which 
is patrolled by contract security at all times.  The 
offices are covered by a closed-circuit video security 
system as well as an off-hours electronic access 
control and alarm system. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Dmitrovsky 
Electricity network, Dmitrov, Russia, as a reliable 
recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities. It is 
requested that post be notified of final disposition 
of the application, and of any shipments for this 
organization in order to conduct appropriate FCS 
follow-up and statistical reporting.
