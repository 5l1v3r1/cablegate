IN THE PEACE PROCESS 
 
REF: KAMPALA 1079 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action message.  See paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) U.N. Special Envoy Chissano, the international observer 
team, and post concur that we consider making another public 
statement to keep up the momentum of the process in the wake of 
agreement on the general principles of accountability and 
reconciliation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post requests that Washington approve the release, in 
Washington or Kampala, of a statement as proposed in paragraph 4. 
This draft has been approved by the GOU.  Our attempts to run it by 
Chissano have not been successful, but he did approve the EU 
statement which was based on this draft. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) "The United States is pleased that the parties at the 
peace negotiations in Juba were able to agree on general principles 
on accountability and reconciliation.  We continue to support the 
Government of Southern Sudan's mediation efforts at Juba, the 
efforts of the U.N. Special Envoy for LRA-Affected Areas, Joachim 
Chissano, and the participation of the international observers from 
Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Congo, and South Africa to bring peace 
to northern Uganda.  Together, they have succeeded in bringing the 
peace process to this important juncture.  We view the consutations 
with key stakeholders throughout Uganda n mechanisms of 
accountability and reconciliatio as a critical part of the peace 
process.  We encourage the parties to use this opportunity to engage 
the long-suffering people of northern Uganda in a serious dialogue 
on these mechanisms to provide the basis for lasting peace.  Our 
priority remains peace in the region.  We continue to provide 
humanitarian, recovery, and redevelopment assistance to the people 
living in LRA-affected areas, promote reconciliation, and support 
the reintegration of former abductees and ex-combatants into their 
communities."
