¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Special Electronics, 
Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license applications: 
NLR as the ultimate consignee of 96 electronic integrated circuits 
and micro assemblies, parts and digital field programmable gate 
arrays. These items are controlled for national security, 
anti-terrorism, missile technology and nuclear non-proliferation 
reasons under ECCN 3A001. The licensee is Actel Corporation, 2061 
Stierlin Ct, Mountain View, CA 94043. 
 
¶3. On March 17, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of Special Electronics, 127 Vernadskogo 
Prospekt, Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Nadezhda 
Nesterova, Sales Manager. 
 
¶4. Special Electronics was founded in 1994 as an electronics 
components re-seller and distributor. Special Electronics is a 
closed joint company partially owned by the German Electronics firm 
Weidmuller. The company has 10 employees in its Moscow office and 10 
employees in its St Petersburg location. 
 
¶5. Nesterova stated that all of the components in reftel have 
already been sold to a Russian oil and gas company. She also said 
that the company is being hit rather hard by the global financial 
crisis but expects to make it through it as they did during the 
crisis of 1998. 
 
¶6. Special Electronics appeared to be fully operational, and had 
electronic components on mounted displays featured throughout the 
office. Specialty Electronics has been in the electronics components 
market in Russia for more than 15 years and has a legitimate need 
and a legitimate end use for the reftel commodity. Nesterova was not 
evasive when answering the export control teamQs questions. The 
export control did not notice any impropriety during the end use 
check. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Special Electronics, Moscow, 
Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
