¶1.  (SBU) EconPolCouns delivered reftel demarche on September 
12 to the MFA's DAS-level Middle East Director, Wolfgang 
Lapuh.  Lapuh said there was virtually "full agreement" 
between the U.S. and Austria -- and, for that matter, the 
U.S. and the EU -- on the points we reviewed.  He noted that 
the EU Neighborhood Policy Action Plan had always treated the 
Lebanese government as fully responsible for all of Lebanon, 
and this was fully congruent with a broader effort to 
encourage the government to assume this role. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Lapuh said Austria had committed a total of 900,000 
Euros to relief in Lebanon.  This included 400,000 Euros 
toward the removal of unexploded ordnance (UXO).
