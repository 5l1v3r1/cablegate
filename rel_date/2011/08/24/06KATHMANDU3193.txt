REF: SECSTATE 195763 
 
(SBU) On December 8, Ambassador Moriarty met with Foreign 
Minister K.P. Oli to urge the Government of Nepal (GON) to 
support an initiative within the UN Human Rights Council 
(UNHRC) to send a UN mission to Sudan to assess the security 
and humanitarian crisis (reftel).  Joint Secretary for Europe 
and the Americas, Hira Bahadur Thapa, also attended the 
meeting.  The Ambassador specifically requested that the GON 
co-sponsor the Finnish resolution and stressed the importance 
of empowering the UNHRC to address issues outside the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   Nepal could use this 
opportunity to demonstrate to the UN community its commitment 
to human rights during an important period here, he added. 
FM Oli agreed to look into possible Nepalese support.
