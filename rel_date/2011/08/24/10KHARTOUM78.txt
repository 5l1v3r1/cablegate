¶1. (SBU) Both the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) and the UN African 
Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) require all military personnel and 
civilian employees to undergo training to recognize, report and 
prevent sexual exploitation and abuse.  According to the UNMIS 
Conduct and Discipline Unit (CDU) Officer in Charge (OIC) Ghandi 
Shukry and the UNAMID CDU Chief Wayne Hayde, all UN personnel must 
take several training programs designed to prevent sexual 
exploitation and abuse, including pre-deployment training, 
induction training upon arrival in Sudan, and refresher field 
training while in country.  Both UNMIS and UNAMID also have 
train-the-trainer programs to expand their reach into the 
individual units of peacekeepers around the country.  The UN has a 
mission-wide policy of zero-tolerance and all allegations are 
treated seriously and investigated by the CDU offices, as well as 
within the ranks of the peacekeeping forces.  Substantiated 
allegations result in disciplinary actions up to and including 
demotion, separation from service, and dismissal. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) As staffing and funding permit, the UNMIS CDU visits team 
sites every three to four months in order to provide refresher 
training, analyze areas of concern and identify conditions that 
could increase potential risks.  Shukry and CDU Training Officer 
Andrey Antonov said they provide tailored training to address 
specific conditions and concerns particular to an area.  Locations 
frequented by prostitutes are designated as off-limits to UNMIS 
personnel, and military peacekeepers are prohibited from 
fraternizing with people living in the local community. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The UNMIS CDU has a robust outreach program to engage and 
inform the public on what is and is not proper behavior for UN 
personnel, and how to report incidents of abuse or exploitation. 
The CDU works with local governments, civil society, 
non-governmental organizations, and universities to publicly 
discuss UN standards of conduct. Shukry said UNMIS wants the local 
populace to know that UN personnel do not operate with impunity, 
and that the UN will not tolerate misconduct, especially sexual 
exploitation and abuse.  In 2009, UNMIS conducted five public 
outreach campaigns in the following areas of Southern Sudan: Torit, 
Yambio, Wau, Rumbek, and Bor.  For 2010, they have recruited 
outreach experts to work in Northern Sudan and the transitional 
areas of Abyei, Kadugli, and Ed Damazin. The specific aim will be 
to work with leaders of student and religious groups, and local 
government. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Hayde reported that UNAMID continues to expand its CDU 
presence in Darfur. Conduct and discipline officers were deployed 
to Nyala several months ago.  Due to a lack of secure 
accommodations, the deployment of CDU officers to El Geneina was 
delayed.  They operated out of El Fasher until recently.  Following 
provision of secure housing, one officer moved to El Geneina on a 
full-time basis on January 8, 2010, and another officer will follow 
shortly.  The UNAMID CDU also conducts outreach programs and 
additional training to team sites throughout Darfur and implements 
the same preventive measures to combat sexual exploitation and 
abuse as UNMIS. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Sudanese human rights activists do not consider UNMIS and 
UNAMID peacekeepers to be engaged in widespread sexual exploitation 
and abuse of local populations.  Nahid Jaber-Allah, director of 
SEEMA Center for Training and Protection of Women and Children's 
Rights, said she is not aware of any allegations of misconduct or 
sexual abuse by UN personnel.  Amir Suleiman, director of the 
independent Khartoum Center for Human Rights, said that his 
organization did not track any sexual exploitation cases involving 
UNMIS or UNAMID peacekeepers in 2009.  Khalil Tukras, an 
independent Darfuri human rights activist, also said he is unaware 
of any reports of UNAMID peacekeepers involved in sexual 
exploitation or abuse.  However, he noted that El Fasher residents 
continue to speculate that UN staff in El Fasher are soliciting 
local women as prostitutes.  He suggested more investigation to 
determine if the practice exists and greater outreach to the El 
Fasher community.
