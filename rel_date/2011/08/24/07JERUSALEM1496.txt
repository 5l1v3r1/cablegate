MOH Moghli Keen To Work 
With USAID Health Projects 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) USAID representatives and Econoff met with Minister 
of Health (MOH) Fathi Abu Moghli on July 16 to discuss USAID 
programs in West Bank/Gaza.  Moghli said that the MOH is 
eager to move forward with USAID on the Emergency Medical 
Assistance Program (EMAP III), which supports the Palestinian 
health care system through procurement of pharmaceuticals and 
medical supplies for major health care facilities and 
operational support via sub-grants to NGO facilities, and 
USAID's Mother and Child Health Care (Hanan) project, which 
aims to improve the health of Palestinian women of 
reproductive age and children.  He plans to develop a 
comprehensive, strategic health plan for the West Bank/Gaza 
in the coming weeks, and hoped that the MOH would be USAID,s 
leading partner in its WB/G health care projects. 
 
MOH Gaza Reporting 
To Ramallah Offices 
------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Moghli stated that his office still controls MOH 
operations in Gaza, as PA MOH employees in Gaza continue to 
report to their supervisors in Ramallah.  He said that all 
MOH procurement will be transferred to MOH offices in 
Ramallah and Nablus, yet he plans to ship drugs to Gaza with 
the logistical assistance of ICRC and WHO when needed. 
 
MOP Developing A Quick 
Recovery Program 
---------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) PA Minister of Planning Samir Abdullah emphasized 
the importance of security reform to improving the WB/G 
investment climate by establishing law and order (see 
reftel).  He said that his office is developing a six-month 
"Quick Recovery Plan" (QRP) - in association with the Health, 
Education, and National Economy Ministries - to present to 
the PA Cabinet in the coming weeks.  The QRP aims to improve 
the state of security, education, infrastructure, health 
care, and humanitarian assistance, according to Abdallah.  He 
emphasized the important role that he hoped the private 
sector would play in QRP implementation.
