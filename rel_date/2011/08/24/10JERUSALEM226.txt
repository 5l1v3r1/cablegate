Main Stories: 
-------------Independent daily Al-Quds leads with news on 
Palestinian Autority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas' interview with 
Der Speigel in which he reiterated that Israel has to stop all 
settlement activities and recognize the 1967 borders as the borders 
of a Palestinian state. He noted that these are not preconditions, 
but rather obligations under the road map. 
Abbas is quoted saying that it is not his duty to recognize Israel 
as a Jewish state and expressed disappointment that the US retreated 
from calling for a full settlement freeze. 
 
The dailies report on President Abbas arriving Tokyo after visiting 
Hiroshima yesterday. He will meet with Japanese officials to discuss 
the peace process and bilateral relations. 
 
Al-Quds reports that the Jerusalem municipality will implement 40 
demolition orders against Palestinian houses in East Jerusalem this 
year. The report notes that the Israeli Ministry of Interior has 
more than 200 demolition orders against Palestinian houses in East 
Jerusalem which will be implemented later. 
 
Independent daily Al-Ayyam reports that Hamas will start making 
goodwill gestures towards Fatah in Gaza starting tomorrow. 
 
Al-Quds quotes PLO Executive committee member Ahmad Qurei noting 
that he expects the next five years to see continued conflict 
between the Palestinians and Israel, noting that Israel will not 
recognize the rights of the Palestinians to have an independent 
state. 
 
Al-Ayyam reports on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
stating during the weekly cabinet meeting that Israel is willing to 
pursue peace talks with the Palestinians and Syria without 
preconditions. 
 
The dailies report on PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad in Ramallah

Sunday, February 7: 
 
The dailies run front page stories on President Abbas reiterating 
yesterday from Cairo that Egypt will remain in charge of Palestinian 
national reconciliation, and that he will not agree to transfer 
these duties to any other party. When asked about the US proposal 
for restarting peace negotiations, Abbas added "we have posed 
questions to the US and they will get back to us with responses, 
which will be discussed within the joint Arab framework. When we 
receive the answers, we will announce our position." Abbas also 
noted that he will meet with Khaled Misha'al only after Hamas signs 
the reconciliation agreement. 
 
The three dailies also run front page stories on Hatem Abdel Qader, 
the PA official responsible for Jerusalem, warning Saturday that 
15,000 residents in the Shayyah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem 
might have their homes demolished under the pretext of lack of 
 
JERUSALEM 00000226  002 OF 002 
 
 
building permits. Abdel Qader said during a visit to the 
neighbourhood that the Jerusalem Municipality issued more than 100 
demolition orders for buildings and houses of 4,000 Palestinians. He 
added that Israel is trying to isolate the neighbourhood from the 
surrounding Arab areas because of its strategic importance in terms 
of the demographic balance. 
 
Al-Quds carries a front page story on Israeli sources confirming 
that the US promised Israel it would "bury Goldstone's report at the 
UN General Assembly and prevent it from reaching the UN Security 
Council." According to the report, Israeli sources revealed this 
week a series of meetings between Israel and the US regarding the 
best ways to confront the Goldstone report. The report also stated 
that the US asked Israel to establish a committee to investigate the 
claims and alleviate the siege imposed on Gaza. The Israeli sources 
reiterated that the US will not hesitate to use its veto in the 
Security Council. 
 
Saturday, FeQuary 6: 
 
The three dailies run front page stories on FatQCentral Committee 
member Nabil Shaath leaving Gaza on Friday after conQcting several 
political meetings with Palestinian factions. Reports note that 
well-informed Palestinian sources expect Hamas to sign the national 
reconciliation agreement with the next few days. 
 
The dailies carry separate front page stories on PreQdent Abbas' 
meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo to discuss 
the latest developments in the Palestinian Territories and the 
re-launching of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. Palestinian 
Ambassador to Egypt Al Farra said that President Abbas will discuss 
the proposals that were put forward by Special Envoy George Mitchell 
regarding the resumption of negotiations. 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Under the title "Reconciliation Obstacle...Until When?" an editorial 
in Al-Quds urges Fatah and Hamas to pursue the national 
reconciliation and end the state of division. The author can't find 
any justification for both parties to postpone national 
reconciliation. The author believes that regardless of the 
difference in ideologies between Hamas and Fatah, the plan has to be 
signed as soon as possible to end the [Palestinian] people's 
sufferings.
