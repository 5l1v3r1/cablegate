On 8 November poloff delivered talking points (reftels) to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Americas Desk Officer Augustin 
Rutikara.  Rutikara said the USG positions on the UNGA third 
comittee (refs A and B) would be considered but he had no 
immediate comment.  On the USG objection to the Cuba Embargo 
Resolution (ref D), Rutikara said the GOR holds the view that 
embargos hurt populations not leaders and are generally not 
effective.  He did not seem persuaded by the talking points 
and did not know if Rwanda would support the Autralian 
amendment (ref C) but promised to quickly dissiminate the 
demarches to the Ministry's decision makers.
