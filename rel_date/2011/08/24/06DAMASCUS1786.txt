Syria/Indonesia, Lebanon, Palestinian Territories (4/19) 
 
 
¶1.  Summary: Syrian papers reported that President Asad 
discussed developments in Iraq and Lebanon in a phone call to UN 
SecGen Kofi Anan. Both sides expressed hope for a softening of 
tension in the region. 
 
Papers also reported that President Asad conferred with Rostam 
Tamboraka, Chairman of the Indonesian-Syrian Parliamentary 
Friendship Association, and that discussion focused on bilateral 
relations and challenges confronting the Islamic world. 
 
Syrian papers also featured a statement by Sufian al-Allao, 
Syrian Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources, denying Syria's 
involvement in any illegal operation by any Iraqi company 
working in oil trade between the two countries, in response to 
media reports about the smuggling of Iraqi petroleum to Syria by 
tank truck. The Minister announced that the Syrian and Iraqi 
governments are implementing an agreement for exchange of oil 
and electricity products in accordance with an agreement signed 
between the two countries on 28/8/2003 and renewed on 5/1/2006. 
"Syrians are providing Iraqis with benzene, home kerosene and 
electricity, and we are paid for these materials with Iraqi fuel 
to Syria," he noted. He said that the Syrian government had tens 
of contracts with private companies to import the Iraqi fuel to 
Syria.

¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
 
------------------ 
 
"To Be Encouraged" 
 
------------------ 
 
Ali Qasim, an editorialist in government-owned Al-Thawra, wrote 
(4/19) "Syria's announcement that it will open the door for 
Syrian citizens to make donations for the Palestinian people is 
in line with the inclinations of the Arab street, which realizes 
that there is a desperate need to support Palestinians at this 
stage, especially because of the American and European position, 
which punishes the Palestinian people for their democratic 
choices.... 
 
"If this Syrian position, in its essence, expresses Syria's 
commitment to the Palestinian people and their causes, it is 
also another sign affirming that commitment to the requirements 
of Arab masses and the fulfillment of their aspirations can be 
achieved away from all the vituperation and excuses that are 
being offered.... 
 
"No matter how far the Arab governments go in their compliance 
with foreign pressure, they cannot but offer real aid to the 
Palestinian people. They cannot abandon Palestinians under any 
excuse, because there is a sweeping popular Arab sympathy toward 
the Palestinians and their options.... 
"When Syria opens the door for donations to help the Palestinian 
people, it realizes that similar steps will be taken by many 
Arab and Islamic countries, and that those who are hesitant to 
offer aid or to meet members of the new Palestinian government 
will definitely be encouraged to get closer to reality and 
become more appreciative of the facts of the situation." 
 
-------------------- 
 
"Required Positions" 
 
-------------------- 
 
Omar Jaftali, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen, 
commented (4/19): "Arab and Islamic financial and political 
support for the Palestinian people is a human and ethical duty 
and a logical response to the American-European support for 
Israel in its open war against the Palestinians.... 
 
"Syria has decided to launch a donation campaign for 
Palestinians and Qatar and Iran have offered $150 million to 
help the Palestinian Authority.... But this is not enough to 
prevent the human disaster assailing the Palestinian people from 
all directions.... 
 
"The Arab and Muslim worlds must spare no effort to support the 
Palestinian cause in international fora and to expose Israeli 
aggression and force Israel to implement UN resolutions...."

"In Order to Have an Accomplished Independence" 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
Elias Murad, chief editor of government-owned Al-Ba'th, 
commented on the 60th anniversary of Syria's independence on 
(4/19): "As we commemorate Evacuation Day with mixed feelings of 
pain and yearning, we are distressed because the hands of 
Israeli occupiers are still tampering with Syrian Arab territory 
in the Golan, because the establishment of the Palestinian state 
has not been completed, and because Jerusalem, which contains 
Islamic and Christian holy places, is being attacked and 
Judaized in an attempt to abolish its Arab character and 
identity. And we yearn to meet our steadfast kinsfolk and see 
our land in the Golan. But these must not remain mere emotions. 
We must move from words to action through a multifaceted 
resistance against the Israeli occupation forces. The enemy, 
which totally ignores all international resolutions, apparently 
understands one language only, the language of resistance, in 
which the Arabs and the Syrians are definitely fluent...."
