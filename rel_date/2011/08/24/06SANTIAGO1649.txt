SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - VENEZUELA'S UNSC CANDIDACY 
 
 
On July 31, conservative, afternoon daily "La Segunda" (circ 
31,834): carried an editorial by former DC congressman Tomas Jocelyn 
Holt entitled, "Venezuela and United Nations."  Quotes: 
 
"Those who take part today in the debate about Venezuela and Chile's 
vote in the UNSC babble about regional policy and the United States. 
 But Venezuela wants the seat to promote its own global vision.... 
The question is if we share that vision. 
 
"When Chile and Mexico coincided in the UN Security Council, they 
upheld Latin America's feeling on the war in Iraq.  Are we confident 
that Venezuela will do the same or will it give priority to its 
complaints about the United States and its own global vision? 
 
"Venezuela's bid has the support of the Islamic Conference.  Chile 
has accomplished an exemplary coexistence among Christians, 
Palestinians, and Jews.  Will we ignore this alignment between 
Venezuela and Iran?  ... Chile must promote regional integration 
based on trust, mutual respect, and shared international views.... 
The European Union would not stand for a Milosevic, Franco, Le Pen, 
Mussolini or anyone like them.  Neither should we."
