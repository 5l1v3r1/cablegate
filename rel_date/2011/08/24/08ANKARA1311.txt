CONFERENCE DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 077168 
 
Â¶1. We delivered reftel demarche to MFA Acting Deputy Director 
General Elif Ulgen on July 22.  She reiterated GOT's 
reticence in participating in Global Initiative activities, 
even technical, working-level events, since Cyprus became a 
partner in 2007.  She offered to circulate the information 
sheet to relevant agencies, but said it would be unlikely 
that Turkey will send a participant to the Legal and 
Regulatory Frameworks Conference in September.
