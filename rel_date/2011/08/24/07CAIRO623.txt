¶1.  (SBU) Arab League Secretariat Staff Member Zeid Al Sabban 
confirmed to poloff on March 6 that the League wanted to host 
the next International Contact Group (ICG) meeting in Cairo, 
and was consulting in Nairobi for dates in early April.  A 
diplomatic note from the AL asserting that the meeting would 
be held on April 5 "was a mistake," Sabban said, as that date 
was not chosen through a process of consultation with 
co-chairs U.S. and Norway, nor with other ICG members. 
(Note: The AL sent a new diplomatic note to Cairo missions of 
ICG members on March 6 saying the date for the meeting 
remained under consideration.  End note).  In subsequent 
conversations on March 7, Sabban stated that ICG members in 
Nairobi were considering April 4 as a possible meeting date 
in Cairo. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Embassy looks forward to confirmation of a date for 
the ICG meeting, including participation by AF Assistant 
Secretary Fraser.  We hope that bilateral consultations with 
 
SIPDIS 
the Egyptians on African issues can also be scheduled in 
tandem with this CG meeting.  We note that Egyptian MFA 
contacts have expressed to us their interest in participating 
in the CG meeting, should it take place in Cairo.  Poloff 
Chris Hegadorn will be the Embassy point of contact for both 
events.
