SUBJECT: IRAQ NEIGHBORS PROCESS: MARCH 1-4 ENERGY WORKING 
GROUP AND GAS TRILATERAL PROPOSED 
 
REF: SECSTATE 00559 
 
¶1.  (SBU) MFA Energy Department Head Altay and GOT Iraq 
Coordinator Celikol told us in separate meetings that the GOI 
has agreed to dates for the next meeting of the Neighbors 
Process Energy Working Group.  The GOT plans to host the 
Energy Working Group on March 1 and 2 in Istanbul.  The GOT 
is proposing that the meeting be followed by a trilateral 
(IZ-TU-US) meeting on Iraqi gas March 3 and 4.  Celikol 
expressed hope that Steve Mann and/or Matt Bryza might be 
able to travel to Istanbul to participate. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) We informed MFA that the gas trilateral dates 
overlap by one day with the Washington International 
Renewable Energy Conference (WIREC) that Secretary Rice will 
host March 4-6 (reftel). Altay said he would raise this issue 
within MFA and with the Ministry of Energy.
