8 HOLOCAUST STATEMENT 
 
 
¶1. (U) On 9 December 2005, Turkish Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Namik Tan delivered a statement in reply to a question about 
Iranian President Ahmadi-Nejad's 8 December 2005 statement 
casting doubt on the holocaust.  The text of the Turkish 
statement is below. 
 
¶2. (U) Begin Text: 
It is very important today to promote and develop dialog, 
understanding, and friendship between countries and nations. 
This is all the more vital in a world which has been riddled 
with problems for such a long time.  It is not possible to 
approve of such confrontational statements at a time when 
what is needed is dialog, compromise, and cooperation.  Such 
statements will not promote the interests of either those who 
issue them or anyone else.  They can only fuel instability 
and the crisis of confidence. 
 
That the Jews were subjected to genocide during World War I 
(Holocaust) is an historical fact which hurt the conscience 
of humanity.  This crime against humanity has been recognized 
by international law, too. 
 
Our country extended help to those Jews who fled Nazi tyranny 
by admitting them as refugees.  Our country is also a 
signatory to a recent related resolution passed by the United 
Nations General Assembly. 
 
It should be everybody's priority to try to solve the 
existing problems and prevent new problems and disasters.
