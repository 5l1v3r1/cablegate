REF: (A) STATE 45972; (B) STATE 46997 
 
¶1.  As background in responding to reftels, the Government of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has warm relations with Cuba. 
 In fact, former President Laurent Kabila, whose son Joseph is the 
DRC's current head of state, fought alongside Che Guevara in the 
1960's in the eastern Congo in Guevara's ill-fated African adventure 
to oust military dictator (and former U.S. ally) Joseph-Desire 
Mobutu (later Mobutu Sese Seku).  With Kabila's 1997 triumph over 
Mobutu after a conflict that lasted some 30 years, pro-Cuban 
Congolese are in most key government positions.  Nonetheless, 
attitudes towards Cuba are changing slowly as the old guard is 
replaced by a new generation of leaders. 
 
¶2.  Charge approached Mangenda Tshibangu, deputy chief editor of Le 
Potentiel, a prominent Kinshasa daily, who has agreed in principle 
to publish an op-ed piece on the Day of Cuban Solidarity in the 
newspaper's May 21 edition.  Embassy is translating into French the 
op-ed piece provided by the Department.  Other materials will be 
sent as a press packet to major media outlets and will also be 
posted on Embassy's bilingual website.  Finally, although occurring 
after the Day of Cuban Solidarity, on May 24 DCM will speak on Cuba 
to a group of university students.
