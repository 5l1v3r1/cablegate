¶1.  (U) A senior Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
official, Mohamed Shaaban, has been named by UN Secretary 
General Ban Ki-Moon as the Under Secretary General for 
General Assembly and Conference Management.  Shaaban had most 
recently served as Egypt's National Coordinator for Reform 
Initiatives within the MFA, focused mainly on the Broader 
Middle East and North Africa (BMENA) portfolio. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post has generally found Ambassador Shaaban 
unhelpful and dogmatic, with a mandate to stymie U.S., 
European, and G-8 efforts in the BMENA context.  Shaaban was 
the GOE's point-person for planning an Egyptian-hosted G-8 
and Arab League ministerial scheduled for March 2004, which 
the Secretary ultimately declined to attend.  Shaaban's 
performance at BMENA conferences is characterized by his 
negativity, his opposition to meaningful NGO participation, 
and by his lawyerly efforts to gut the BMENA programs of 
their substantive impact.
