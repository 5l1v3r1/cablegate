¶1.  (U) UNSRSG for Afghanistan Tom Koenigs opened the UNAMA 
Khost Office, one of nine new UNAMA provincial offices, on 
January 21.  In his remarks, Koenigs highlighted the 
provincial center's importance to the region, noting its 
university (being developed), economic activity, and 
strategic location.  According to Koenigs, over 4,000 
individuals cross the Afghan-Pakistan border daily to conduct 
business, visit their families, or for employment.  The SRSG 
highlighted Khost as an example of where residents were 
prepared to take responsibility for their own security, and 
applauded the November agreement by which religious and 
tribal leaders spoke out collectively against violence and 
condemned terrorist attacks.  Citing Governor Jamal's 
leadership, Koenigs said UNAMA will support the Governor's 
Conflict Resolution Commission and the provincial planning 
process.  The goal is to help overcome a traditional lack of 
investment by the international community.  Koenigs announced 
that UNAMA would be working with the Afghan Independent Human 
Rights Commission (AIHRC) to monitor, investigate and report 
on all human rights cases, "regardless of the perpetrators." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador had pressed for the early opening of 
the UNAMA Khost office following his visit to Khost on 
November 21 (Ref).  The office will facilitate the reach of 
and engagement with the central government, including through 
the provincial planning process that will encourage increased 
central government and international assistance.  The office 
in Khost is the fourth of nine new offices to be opened. 
Others already opened are in Badghis, Zabul, and Kunar.
