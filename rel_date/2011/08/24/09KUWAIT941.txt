SUBJECT: KUWAIT CONTINUES TO TREAT IRAQI VICTIMS OF AUGUST 
19 ATTACKS 
 
REF: KUWAIT 896 
 
(U) Six of the 14 Iraqis injured in the August 19 Baghdad 
bomb blasts and subsequently sent to Kuwait for treatment 
(Ref A) were discharged on September 20 and another three 
were discharged on September 25, Iraqi Embassy Charge 
D'Affairs Ahmad Al-Jarba told Embassy on September 27. 
According to Al-Jarba, the discharged Iraqis had fully 
recovered and the GOK paid for them to fly back via Gryphon 
Airlines.  (Note: In a bilateral first, the victims were 
medevaced out of Baghdad by the Kuwaiti Air Force.  End 
note.)  The gesture fulfills an instruction issued by Amir 
Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al Sabah to his government to assist in 
the transport and subsequent medical care of Iraqi victims of 
this incident.  (Note: Reftel incorrectly reported that 25 
Iraqis had been sent to Kuwait, based on figures provided by 
the GOK.  However, that number included escorts who had 
accompanied the 14 victims.  End note.)
