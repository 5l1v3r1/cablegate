¶1.  (SBU) Poloff met with Moroccan Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Head of Section of Security and Disarmament Affairs 
Bouchaib Eloumni on June 17 to discuss reftel seeking 
Morocco's comments on the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism (GICNT) Model Guidelines Document.  Eloumni 
reminded Poloff that he had requested the U.S. delegation to 
address this issue during the recent GICNT Conference held in 
Rabat earlier this month but no one was available to lead the 
session.  According to Eloumni, many GICNT participants have 
questions about the Model Guidelines Document. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Eloumni agreed to share the document with relevant 
departments within the Government of Morocco (GOM) as well as 
with the Moroccans who participated in the recent GICNT Model 
Guidelines Document Technical Review Workshop in Garmish, 
Germany last April.  He agreed to submit Morocco's comments 
via the Global Initiative Information Portal (GIIP) by the 
July 13 deadline. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Eloumni requested that the Department upload a 
French version of the Model Guidelines Document to the GIIP 
to encourage more participation from French-speaking 
countries.  He suggested that consistently providing 
documents in French will be especially helpful to Morocco as 
it plans to host a GICNT West Africa outreach program in late 
2009 or early 2010.  According to Eloumni, French-speaking 
countries will be more likely to get involved and provide 
feedback if they can easily read the documents on the portal.
