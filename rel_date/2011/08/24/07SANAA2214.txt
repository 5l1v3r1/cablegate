SUBJECT: BADAWI RERELEASE RUMORS UNTRUE 
 
On December 5, liberal privately owned weekly al-Wasat, in a 
front page story, reported that unidentified sources had told 
the paper that the Political Security Organization (PSO) had 
once again released convicted USS Cole bombing conspirator 
Jamal al-Badawi.  Emboffs approached the relevant 
authorities, who denied the story and immediately escorted 
emboff to an empty office, where Badawi was then brought in. 
He was not handcuffed and appeared to be in good health. 
Emboff ascertained that it was Badawi but did not engage him 
in conversation.
