In Today's Papers 
 
Turkish National Day Marked by anti-Terror Protests 
All papers report that on Monday, Turkey has celebrated Republic Day 
with the highest civilian participation in recent years, with tens 
of thousands gathering to show that "the country's unity cannot be 
undermined."  Ceremonies were held across Turkey to mark the 84th 
anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic.  Demonstrators, 
carrying Turkish flags and the pictures of Turkish soldiers killed 
in fighting with the PKK, condemned the terror attacks.  Papers note 
that this year's Republic Day celebrations had "higher spirits" than 
in the past, partly due to a sense that the integrity of the country 
is threatened by terrorism.  More than 400,000 people visited the 
mausoleum of Ataturk, modern Turkey's founder, in Ankara on Monday. 
In the mainly Kurdish southeastern part of Turkey, too, people 
protested terror and called for peace, with a crowd in Yuksekova, 
along the border with Iraq, releasing doves of peace. 
 
Buyukanit: Wait for Erdogan-Bush Meeting before Iraq Incursion 
All papers reported over the weekend that the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) chief General Yasar Buyukanit told reporters at a reception on 
Saturday that the TGS would wait for the outcome of Prime Minister 
Erdogan's November 5 meeting with President Bush in Washington 
before making a decision on a cross-border incursion into Northern 
Iraq.  "We expect contributions from all the actors, mainly Iraq and 
the United States.  However, we need to wait for the prime 
minister's meeting with President Bush.  It will be a very important 
meeting," Buyukanit emphasized.  "There has only been talk so far, 
but this time we are at the stage of doing something," said the TGS 
chief, stressing the Turkish military would launch a cross-border 
operation into Northern Iraq "when it is tasked to do so."  Monday 
papers also report Buyukanit said in his message marking the 
Republic Day that the military is determined to "hurt" the PKK 
terrorists who "hurt the nation" in recent terror attacks "much 
stronger than they could ever imagine." 
 
Papers: Rice to Visit Turkey November 2 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
report Secretary Rice will come to Ankara on November 2 to meet 
President Gul, Prime Minister Erdogan and Foreign Minister Babacan, 
and will move on to Istanbul to participate in the Iraq Neighbors' 
Ministerial meetings November 3.  Papers expect the Turkish leaders 
to give Rice the message that Turkey's patience over the PKK terror 
was wearing out.  Liberal Radikal expects Rice to convey a special 
message to President Gul from President Bush.  "A tough week in 
relations with the United States," says a page one headline in 
Radikal, reporting that following the Rice visit, Erdogan will meet 
President Bush on November 5 as Turkey looks for concrete US action 
against the PKK terrorists.  "It's not clear what Rice will bring, 
but any plan that will not stop the PKK will cause more strains," 
says the paper. 
 
Operations against the PKK Continue in Gabar and Cudi Mountains 
All weekend and today's papers report that Turkish Military has been 
conducting operations in Hakkari, Tunceli and Sirnak as well as at 
the mountains of Cudi, Gabar, Kato and Kupeli.  When Turkish troops 
spotted the arrival of nearly 100 PKK terrorists at Cudi Mountain 
the other night through the thermal goggles, Turkish commandoes 
started an intensive search in the mountains while helicopters 
bombed the region.  Borders were also kept under tight control to 
prevent trapped PKK terrorists' attempt to escape into Northern 
Iraq.  Mainstream Sabah reports that the number of terrorists who 
were killed in Tunceli has reached 17.  Meanwhile, 4 soldiers lost 
their lives in the latest operations. 
 
Meshoud Barzani: "PKK Violence Should Stop" 
Milliyet columnist Hasan Cemal interviewed Kurdish Regional leader 
Barzani in Northern Iraq.  Barzani was quoted as saying "I am 
Turkey's friend.  Kurds and Turks are brothers and they should 
remain so.  Kurds are not a threat for Turkey's security and our 
 
ANKARA 00002676  002 OF 003 
 
 
common interest is to live together in peace.  PKK terrorist 
organization should stop violence otherwise they will find not only 
Turkey, but all the Kurdish nation against itself. " 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkey-Iraq/PKK 
Murat Yetkin commented in the liberal-intellectual daily Radikal 
(10/30):  "Turkey has started waiting for concrete action from the 
US ever since Secretary Rice's phone call to PM Erdogan on October 
21 and developments afterwards.  American sources say that 
Washington has been working hard to be able to say something 
concrete either during Secretary Rice's Ankara visit or during the 
Iraqi Neighbors' Ministerial in Istanbul.   Ankara is very clear not 
to tolerate any time-gaining formula, such as a special envoy for 
anti-terrorism mechanism.  This time Ankara expects a real concrete, 
tangible step.  What defers the US from taking such a step?  The 
answer to this question is Barzani, but given the US status in Iraq, 
this is not a convincing argument.  Moreover, statements from US 
military in the north of Iraq, such as General Benjamin Mixon, are 
putting Washington in a very difficult situation vis-`-vis Ankara. 
General Mixon recently said that they were not given any order to 
take action against PKK.  Ankara prefers to remain cool about 
Barzani's statements as well.  It patiently waits for Washington to 
keep its promises.  A high level Turkish official described Barzani 
as the 'Frankenstein of the US' yet added that it is impossible to 
believe that Barzani will not listen to what President Bush would 
say to him.  The visit of Secretary Rice will be tough.  Tension 
will increase if she proposes a plan to stop Turkey's action instead 
of stopping the PKK.  If this happens, the only remaining 
expectation will be the Erdogan -Bush meeting on November 5." 
 
Erdal Safak observed in the mainstream daily Sabah (10/30):  "Turkey 
gave two weeks to the US for not carrying out a cross border 
operation.  One week is already over, and the second week will cover 
both Secretary Rice's visit to Turkey and PM Erdogan's trip to 
Washington.  Turkey has finished a military build up at the border, 
and from now on, there is no point of returning back to doing 
nothing.  The US has two options: either it will end the PKK 
shelters in Northern Iraq, or it will let Turkish army to finish the 
job.  This is not a war between Turks and the Kurds, its goal is to 
end terrorism.  Of course the US has another option, which is to 
carry out a joint operation with Turkey.  In fact, this is the best 
possible option for Washington considering the NATO partnership as 
well as bilateral strategic partnership.  Washington has to 
understand that this is the time to make the choice.  The US either 
takes action based on the spirit of strategic partnership or faces 
losing Turkey's friendship for a very long time."
