¶1. (SBU) Responding to reftel points, MFA Acting Director for 
International Organizations Eli Ben-Tura told PolOff June 16 
that the GOI expects to release "in the very near future" the 
shipment of technical equipment destined for use by the 
Jerusalem Waqf to preserve Islamic-era manuscripts.  Ben-Tura 
said that "Customs has agreed and the paperwork is ready;" 
all that remained was for Israel to receive Jordanian payment 
for the storage costs.  Barring any last-minute surprises, 
the shipment should be released and in Waqf hands well before 
the July 2 commencement of the World Heritage Committee 
meeting in Quebec, he said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On the other issue raised reftel -- continuing 
Israeli opposition to the UNESCO Convention on the Protection 
and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions -- 
Ben-Tura was not aware of any change in Israel's position 
since its 2005 vote, but acknowledged the European pressure 
to sign the Convention.  He vowed to discuss our points with 
others and respond if anything changes.
