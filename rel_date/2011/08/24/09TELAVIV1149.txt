SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT:

¶1.  Mideast 
 
¶2.  Iran

Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The media reported that PM Benjamin Netanyahu told his Likud party's 
Knesset faction yesterday, following a stormy debate on the 
outposts, that coordination with Washington over the Iranian threat 
is more important than illegal settlement outposts.  The statements 
essentially adopt the American view that concessions to the 
Palestinians would make it easier to halt Iran's nuclear program. 
However, the media reported that Netanyahu adheres to the principle 
of Qnatural growthQ in settlements.  Israel Radio reported that DM 
Ehud Barak and FM Avigdor Lieberman back NetanyahuQs outposts plan. 
Maariv reported that Barak and Lieberman are pressing Netanyahu to 
re-endorse the Roadmap.  Yediot reported that in an interview with 
Aljazeera-TV over the weekend, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
stated the PresidentQs view that settlement construction must be 
stopped.  HaQaretz reported that the State Department indicated on 
Sunday that despite PM NetanyahuQs comments last week that Jerusalem 
would never be divided, the cityQs future is yet to be determined. 
 
HaQaretz reported that, following heavy U.S. pressure, the GOI might 
permanently open the crossings to Gaza for food, medications, and 
other goods. 
 
Chief PA negotiator Ahmed Qurei (Abu Ala) was quoted as saying in an 
interview with HaQaretz that settlers in Ariel and MaQaleh Adumim 
can remain in the Palestinian state as residents.  HaQaretz quoted 
the PAQs Minister on Jerusalem Affairs as saying that the PA would 
be willing to transfer control of the Temple Mount to a third 
party. 
 
All media quoted Syrian President Bashar AssadQs comment on Saturday 
that IsraelQs most extreme government ever is the greatest obstacle 
to peace.  The Jerusalem Post reported that, during his talks in 
Washington last week, Netanyahu expressed concern that Hizbullah 
could gain considerable strength in the upcoming Lebanese elections 
and possibly put together a ShiQite bloc that would control the 
country.  All media cited the German weekly Der SpiegelQs online 
report that concluded that Hizbullah was behind the assassination of 
Lebanese PM Rafiq Hariri. 
 
The Jerusalem Post cited a Foreign Ministry statement as saying 
yesterday that a powerful underground nuclear test conducted by 
North Korea yesterday requires a determined international reaction 
Qin order to send a message to other countries.Q  Yediot quoted DM 
Barak as saying that talk and sanctions will not stop rogue regimes. 
 Barak called on the U.S. to learn the lessons of the test. 
 
The media quoted GOI sources as saying that PM Netanyahu asked 
Intelligence Agencies Minister Dan Meridor in recent days to replace 
Ofer Dekel as the governmentQs point man on Gilad Shalit. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Deputy FM Danny Ayalon will travel 
to South America next week to attend the meeting of the Organization 
of the American States.  Media reported on the growing influence of 
Iran on that continent.  The newspaper reported that FM Lieberman is 
slated to visit South America and Africa later this year. 
 
The media reported that Israel was QdisappointedQ over Russian PM 
Sergey LavrovQs meeting with HamasQs political leader Khaled Mashal 
on Saturday. 
 
Over the weekend all media reported that the Ministerial Committee 
on Legislation on Legislation approved a bill proposal -- introduced 
by Alex Miller (Yisrael Beiteinu) -- criminalizing anyone who marks 
the PalestiniansQ Nakba Day by making it punishable with up to three 
years in prison.  The media reported that Labor ministers and some 
of their Likud colleagues are opposed to the bill. 
 
HaQaretz reported that Interior Minister Eli Yishai, chairman of the 
ultra-Orthodox Shas party, warned that if non-Orthodox conversion is 
recognized in Israel, Qthere are hundreds of foreign workers and 
Palestinians who will take advantage of the Reform conversion in 
order to gain Israeli citizenship. 
 
The media reported that the Home Front Command will conduct a 
five-day drill next week, dubbed Turing Point 3, which will send 
Israelis running for their bomb shelters on June 2. 
 
The Jerusalem Post cited a report released by the U.S. CongressQs 
General Accounting Office that the Joint Strike Fighter stealth jet 
that Israel wants to purchase from the U.S. is years behind schedule 
and will likely cost over 40% more than initially predicted. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported on the success of the first visit of 
California Israel Chamber of Commerce (CICC) cleantech delegation to 
the country. 
 
Various media reported that Israel agreed to lift its objection to 
the appointment of Farouk Hosni, EgyptQs vehemently anti-Israeli 
Culture Minister, as head of UNESCO, following a recent meeting 
between Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

¶I.   No Free Lunch" 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (5/25): Q[At the White House.] in his 
distress, Netanyahu hinted that if Obama should succeed in 
convincing Saudi Arabia to begin normalization with Israel, he would 
make sure that construction in the settlements was frozen and that 
outposts would be evacuated.  Obama promised to work for the 
normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.  He 
aspires to great things in that sphere. But normalization and 
settlements are two separate issues.  Netanyahu knows that the 
confrontation is not over.... 
Netanyahu has not engaged in settlement activity any more than his 
predecessors did.  On the contrary.  The settlement enterprise was 
nourished mainly by plans that were approved by previous 
governments.  The problem is the diplomatic horizon.... Netanyahu 
came to Obama with politically empty hands.  The moment that he 
ruled out the two-state solution, he stole away the ability of the 
President of the United States to advance negotiations.  And without 
negotiations, the question of settlements pops up again, even more 
sharply.  In all, Obama tried to remind Netanyahu of a brief and 
practical American proverb: There is no such thing as a free lunch. 
Netanyahu uses this term a great deal about others.  Regrettably, he 
is not very good at listening. 
 
II.  "The Penny Has Dropped For Bibi" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Shimon Shiffer wrote in Yediot Aharonot 
(5/26): Q [Netanyahu] now knows that the Obama administration isnQt 
willing to concede the linkage, which is awful for Netanyahu, 
between Iran and the settlements.  That if Israel wants Washington 
to help it stop IranQs nuclear armament, it is going to have to hold 
up its end of the bargain. And IsraelQs end of the bargain is rather 
clear. Obama and his aides repeat their mantra every day: Israel has 
to stop expanding its settlements in the territories and to remove 
the illegal settlement outposts.... Evacuating a few settlements 
that will make the Americans happy pales against dealing with the 
Iranian nuclear issue.  QThe most dangerous thing that can happen to 
any organization or state,Q said Netanyahu, Qis that it should fail 
to recognize the danger looming closer.Q  Netanyahu has identified 
the looming danger.  That is also why he sent his advisers, Yitzhak 
Molcho and Uzi Arad, along with Minister Dan Meridor, to London. 
They will meet there with senior Obama administration officials in 
order to establish work teams for the implementation of the policy 
that pertains to stopping the Iranian nuclear program, stopping 
construction in the settlements, easing restrictions on the lives of 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, and in enlisting the Arab 
states to join the peace process.  But Netanyahu also knows that his 
real test isnQt going to be faced in Washington. His real test will 
be in [the outposts of] Mitzpe Yitzhar and Ramot Gilad: To what 
extent will he succeed in enlisting the settlers to his side and at 
enforcing law and order in Judea and Samaria [i.e. the West Bank]? 
To what extent, basically, can he prove himself to be the person in 
charge here? 
 
III.  "Listening and Talking to Syria" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (5/25): QThe 
statements Syrian President Bashar Assad made in Damascus on 
Saturday are subject to two contradictory -- or complementary -- 
interpretations, depending on one's point of view.  Assad said the 
failure to use diplomatic means to win back the territories Israel 
conquered in 1967 justifies the QresistanceQ -- a term that is 
generally used by members of organizations like Hizbullah and Hamas 
and can also be applied to military activity by countries like 
Syria. Nonetheless, Assad added, Damascus' preferred route is peace. 
So is this a call for peace or a threat of war?  The resolution of 
this dilemma can be found, to a large extent, on the Israeli 
side.... The Syrian issue has been pushed to the margins of public 
discourse due to last week's meeting between Netanyahu and Obama.... 
So far, both sides have avoided actually paying the price, with 
Israel's refusal to do so leaving the initiative in the hands of 
Assad (and Obama).  It may also provide Syria with the justification 
for dealing a short, painful military blow in a bid to break the 
diplomatic stalemate.  It would be wise to listen attentively to 
Assad's words and to resume discussions with him, posthaste. 
 
IV.  QDangerous Legislation 
 
HaQaretz editorialized (5/26): QIsrael was established with the 
encouragement and approval of the United Nations to give a homeland 
to the Jewish people.... The Zionist act was daring and justified, 
but the renaissance of one people extracted a tragic price from the 
other, which lived on the soil of the Promised Land.  The 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in which Israel's Arab citizens find 
themselves between a rock and a hard place, will not end until each 
side recognizes the injustice caused by the other, at least at the 
level of awareness.  The attempt to force Israel's Arab citizens to 
identify with the state and discard the memory of their past, or to 
threaten them with imprisonment, will only deepen the sense of 
discrimination and alienation felt by every fifth Israeli.  The 
prohibition against marking the Nakba destroys the chances for 
reconciliation, suggesting that it be replaced with separatist 
nationalism and hatemongering.  We must hope the Knesset does not 
pass this dangerous bill.  It's not a patriotic or nationalist law, 
as its proponents argue, but one that is destructive to democracy 
and society.

¶I.  "A Lesson about the Good and Bad Guys" 
 
Veteran journalist and anchor Dan Margalit wrote on page one of the 
independent Israel Hayom (5/26): QNorth Korea and IranQs 
unrestrained world, backed by Hizbullah and HamasQs arms, should 
teach Obama that words are no substitutes for actions, and that 
formulations cannot replace the use of force.  The President of the 
U.S. is very sophisticated.  But he doesnQt understand that the 
world is sometimes divided in a simple, clear, unpolished way.  Nor 
in a high-tech way -- it is split into good and bad guys.... 
Pyongyang is the indispensable introductory lesson ahead of his 
complex dialogue with Iran. 
 
II.  "Pyongyang Lesson" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (5/26): 
Qit has no doubt been instructive for Iran's supreme leader 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to observe the civilized world's reaction, 
over the years, to North Korean provocations.... By learning from 
the North Koreans, the mullahs may be laying the groundwork -- 
literally -- for an underground nuclear explosion of their own. 
Khamenei knows that while the West spins its wheels, Iran's quest 
for nuclear arms proceeds apace.... Still, the Ayatollah worries. 
It's not inconceivable -- even at this late stage -- that he could 
be forced to freeze Iran's program.  What if the new American 
President runs out of patience, sooner rather than later?  What if 
Barack Obama convinces Europe, Russia and China that the world can't 
afford another North Korea on top of an unraveling nuclear Pakistan? 
 Certainly not one whose imperial ambitions are fueled by 
high-octane religious extremism.  Realistically, Khamenei reassures 
himself that the prospects of crippling sanctions don't figure even 
remotely on the international agenda.  Still, he will sleep a lot 
more soundly once stopping Iran becomes as unthinkable as trying to 
roll back nuclear-armed North Korea.
