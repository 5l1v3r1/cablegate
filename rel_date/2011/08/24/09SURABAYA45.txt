¶1.  (U) Summary. While there are no reports of H1N1 infected 
persons on the Hindu tourist island of Bali, local Airport, 
Health, and Department of Animal Husbandry officials are all 
reportedly prepared for the possibility of H1N1 cases in Bali. 
Airport officials are utilizing thermal scanning equipment at 
airport immigration check points.  Health officials have 
designated specific hospitals to handle suspected cases of H1N1. 
 Department of Animal Husbandry officials have educated local 
hog farmers regarding sanitation issues.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) According to media reports, local authorities in Bali 
have taken steps to prevent the spread of H1N1 influenza to the 
island.  As there are no reports of H1N1 in Bali, efforts have 
focused on the arrival of possibly infected individuals at the 
Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar and the prevention 
of infection and spread among the local hog population. 
According to immigration statistics, approximately 6000 foreign 
nationals arrive in Bali daily.  The Department of Animal 
Husbandry reports that the current hog population in Bali is 
around 925,000 hogs with a majority of hog owners owning only 
one or two hogs. 
 
¶3.  (U) Authorities at the Ngurah Rai International Airport have 
put equipment and a contingency plan in place to mitigate the 
threat of the spread of H1N1 to Bali.  The airport reportedly 
set up a small field hospital in a tent on the premises with 
health care workers divided into three shifts to handle any 
suspected H1N1 cases. 
Should a passenger have a temperature of more than 38 degrees 
Celsius, as indicated by thermal scanning equipment, the 
passenger would then be screened to determine the countries the 
individual visited recently and if he/she potentially came into 
contact with the virus.  Should the individual prove to be a 
suspect H1N1 case, the passenger would be transported by 
ambulance to Sanglah General Hospital for isolation and all 
other passengers from the same flight would potentially be 
quarantined and screened for infection.  Local Health Department 
officials designated the Sanglah General Hospital in Denpasar, 
Tabanan General Hospital, and Sanjiwani General Hospital in 
Gianyar as hospitals to care for suspected H1N1 patients. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In addition to the steps taken by airport and Health 
Department officials, officials with the local Department of 
Animal Husbandry, Fisheries and Oceans in the city of Denpasar 
and regencies of Badung and Tabanan have reportedly taken steps 
to prevent the possibility of swine to human contamination. 
Efforts by animal husbandry officials include educating hog 
owners about the cleanliness and health of their animals, 
providing disinfectant, and advising farmers to clean and 
disinfect pens twice daily.  Officials have also looked into the 
sanitation practices of the five registered pork packing plants 
in Bali.  One local veterinarian who is known to the Consular 
Agency, however, mentioned that none of the small hog farms that 
she is familiar with have been contacted by officials. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Post has not received any reports of American citizen 
visitors to Bali being adversely affected by the airport's 
screening procedures.  Post is only aware of one foreign 
national who was considered a potential carrier, a reporter from 
China who arrived to cover the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 
conference being held May 2 - 5.  After questioning, officials 
determined that he had not traveled to infected areas and 
allowed him to continue his journey.
