SUBJECT: ITALY ACCEPTS 46 AFRICAN MIGRANTS RESCUED AT SEA 
BY U.S. NAVY 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 116313 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On August 20 Embassy Rome made an urgent request 
per Secstate 116313 for assistance with the 46 African 
migrants, rescued at sea by the U.S. Navy August 19 in 
international waters 60 nautical miles off the coast of 
Libya.  The GOI decided late August 20 to take custody of the 
migrants, who were transferred to two Italian Coast Guard 
vessels the morning of August 21.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  POLOFF delivered reftel points, stressing the 
urgent humanitarian aspect, to MFA Chief of Staff to the 
Director General for Italians Abroad and Migrants, Marjline 
Armellin August 20.  Armellin said she would take the matter 
to MFA Vice Director General for Italians Abroad and 
Migrants, Gioacchino Carlo Trizzino, and to the Ministry of 
the Interior immediately and respond as soon as possible, and 
certainly by COB. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  At 1800 local time, VDG Trizzino called Acting 
Political Minister Counselor to say Italy was favorably 
disposed to taking the migrants and requested contact 
information for NAVEUR to coordinate logistics of the 
transfer.  At 2000 NAVEUR Battle Watch contacted poloff to 
ask for a point of contact in the Italian Ministry of the 
Interior since the GOI had not yet contacted NAVEUR.  Poloff 
provided NAVEUR with the contact information for MOI Prefetto 
Beccaria.  At 1000 on August 21, the 46 migrants were 
transferred from the USS DONALD COOK to two Italian Coast 
Guard vessels. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The GOI has requested the USG maintain a passive 
public affairs profile, but has not asked for any other 
assistance or assurances from the USG. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment. This exceptionally quick positive response 
from the GOI on a sensitive issue was particularly noteworthy 
for happening in the middle of the Italian holiday season. 
 
¶6. (U) MINIMIZE CONSIDERED 
End Comment.
