SUBJECT: CANADA IMPLEMENTING DUAL USE ITEM PROVISION OF 
UNSCR 1803 
 
REF: STATE 29464 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request - see para four. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Senior Policy Adviser for Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Che van Haastrecht confirmed on April 1 
that Canada will implement all the requirements of UNSCR 
1803, and that the government will do so via amendments to 
Canada's United Nations Act Iran Regulations.  The process of 
updating relevant Canadian law should be completed by the end 
of the month, he said. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Van Haastrecht reiterated that Canada scrutinizes 
all export licenses for products destined to Iran, and has 
prohibited the exportation of dual-use items for several 
years.  He underscored that Canada had also put into place 
the non-binding aspects of the UNSCR 1803 regarding export 
credits, financial monitoring, and cargo inspections. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Action request:  Van Haastrecht commented that 
Canada was studying ways further to strengthen the Iran 
Regulations under its United Nations Act, such as making 
watch lists more effective, and would welcome input from U.S. 
experts working these issues.  Embassy requests that ISN/RA 
identify an expert counterpart with whom Canadian officials 
could confer on this matter.
