 ¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel points to Andrej 
Plausteiner, Acting Director of the Office of Money 
Laundering Prevention at the Ministry of Finance. 
Plausteiner is also the point of contact for terrorist 
finance issues.  The Government of Slovenia (GOS) is in the 
process of harmonizing its laws with all EU directives.  The 
GOS expects to be fully aligned with EU directives for money 
laundering prevention and terrorist finance by May 2007, a 
full seven months earlier than the deadline given the GOS by 
the EU.  To date, the GOS has had no indication of terrorist 
finance activities within Slovenia.  Plausteiner noted that 
several Bosnian Islamic humanitarian organizations have 
opened accounts in Slovenia.  The accounts are under regular 
monitoring. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In response to the Special FATF Recommendation IX on 
Cash Couriers, Plausteiner informed Econoff that, according 
to Article 27 of the Slovene Law on the Prevention of Money 
Laundering, customs authorities are obliged to forward to the 
Office for Money Laundering Prevention information about 
every carrier transporting across the state border cash and 
securities exceeding the amount of 12,500 euros.  The GOS is 
enacting significant measures to monitor financial 
activities.
