¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Heavy fighting took place in Abyei May 20 
between SAF and SPLM forces. Each side accuses the other of an 
unprovoked attack. A tense calm returned later in the day, with 
both sides back in their original positions. SPLM officials 
complained that President Kiir is under intense pressure to reverse 
his public May 15 order for SPLA restraint and that they are 
frustrated by the failure of international partners to act. A UN 
official told CG Juba that the international community must take a 
strong stand immediately to finally end the Abyei or the situation 
will spin entirely out of control. END SUMMARY. 
 
Battle in Abyei 
- - - - - - - - 
¶2. (SBU) According to UNMIS, early on May 20 SPLA forces entered 
Abyei town and by 0830 had occupied what remained of the town after 
previous fighting. SAF responded by attacking and driving the SPLA 
out, but in turn were themselves ejected by the SPLA, including 
tanks. Following their defeat of the SAF, the SPLA evacuated the 
town and returned to positions on the Kiir river (this roughly 
confirms what MFA U/S told CDA Fernandez early on May 20). At some 
point in the afternoon, SAF aircraft, including Antonov "bombers" 
appeared, circling the town but did not actually bomb, despite 
rumors to the contrary. 
 
SAF "Livid" 
- - - - - 
¶3. (SBU) MFA U/S Mutriff Siddiq called CDA Fernandez May 20 to 
inform him of renewed fighting in Abyei (which was widely reported 
an Al-Jazeera) which Mutriff said was instigated by an SPLA surprise 
attack on the SAF's 31st brigade at 5:00 a.m. the morning of May 20 
(Ref A). The SPLA reportedly took control of the SAF base and 
killed six SAF soldiers - two officers including a colonel and four 
enlisted. Siddiq said the SAF and the NCP are livid and have 
attempted to call the SPLM/A, "but of course all their phones are 
off." 
 
GoSS: We Only Acted Defensively

¶4. (SBU) SPLM/SPLA sources in Juba told ConGen staff a somewhat 
different story than the NCP and UNMIS on the same day. According 
to both GNU Foreign Minister Deng Alor and SPLM Abyei representative 
Edward Lino, SAF forces tried to drive the SPLM JIU contingent away 
from the Kiir river bridge and the SPLA "defended itself". Deng 
Alor stated that the SAF attempted to cross the river an advance 
toward the area where tens of thousands of IDPs have gathered, 
following their flight from Abyei town. Both agreed that after 
having driven off the SAF attack, the SPLA mortared the town itself, 
targeting the SAF cantonment in a former secondary school (the base 
for SAF 31st Brigade). 
 
¶5. (SBU) SPLA Chief of Staff told Conoffs a somewhat different and 
more nuanced version, but agreed that the SAF initially attacked the 
SPLA JIU unit. According to Oyei, the CJMC agreed May 20 that the 
SPLA JIU unit should return to its cantonment in Abyei town and the 
UN agreed to provide transportation. They coordinated with the SAF 
in Abyei, who were open to the SPLA's return. Shortly before the 
SPLA was to move back into the town, the SAF called and said that 
they had received orders from higher headquarters not to allow the 
SPLA back into Abyei and to resist them if they tried to enter. At 
this point the UN backed-out of transporting the SPLA, but the SPLA 
commander decided to proceed anyway. Oyei suggested that the local 
commander was authorized by SPLA headquarters in Juba to do so and 
did not just do this on his own authority. The SPLA returned to 
their cantonment in the town and began to entrench when they were 
attacked by the SAF. At some point, they withdrew back to the River 
Kiir, where they remain, according to Oyei. He suggested that this 
happened after the arrival of four SAF aircraft, two Antonov bombers 
and two helicopter gunships. "This was simply our attempt to 
redeploy the JIU - we will not be trying it again. We have dug in 
outside the town, but this is strictly a defensive posture," he 
said. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Contrary to Mutriff's account, Oyei said that the SPLA in 
Juba has been talking to the SAF in Khartoum, as the SPLA JIU in 
Abyei had been communicating earlier with the SAF there. The SAF in 
Abyei said they were following orders from above. Khartoum claimed 
that local SPLA commanders had gotten out of hand, were acting on 
their own authority, and that Khartoum would straighten them out. 
Oyei doubted SAF headquarters' sincerity. 
 
SPLM Frustration Growing 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶7. (SBU) FM Deng Alor admitted that President Kiir's decision to 
restrain the SPLA has divided the party, and delegates at SPLM 
National Convention complained that while the convention was delayed 
for events in Omdurman, Kiir has not taken similar steps in Abyei's 
wake. The Foreign Minister was nonetheless grateful for the 
American audience, noting he had just complained to the UK 
Ambassador that "only America was active on Abyei through sanctions, 
statements and like." 
 
¶8. (SBU) In all three meetings with SPLM/SPLA officials, ConGen 
Staff underscored USG calls for restraint, reviewed the Special 
Envoy's plan to reach out to Kiir and NCP officials, and urged the 
SPLA to abide by President Kiir's order so that the U.S. could 
assist the parties in implementing a lasting, just solution to the 
Abyei impasse. 
 
International Community Must Take a Stand 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
¶9. (SBU) In a May 19 conversation with foreign diplomats, including 
Congen Juba staff, UNDP Peace and Development Advisor Ferdinand von 
Hapsburg, a long-time incisive observer of the South, said that he 
is extremely concerned about Abyei and argued that the international 
community needs to weigh in with a strong joint statement expressing 
their concern and including calls for: 1.) lowering the rhetoric 
on both sides, 2.) a mutual withdrawal by the SPLA and the SAF, 3.) 
disbanding of militias, and 4.) prompt establishment of an Abyei 
administration. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Hapsburg said that he is very worried that the situation 
is getting totally out of control; that as Abyei remains unresolved, 
the hardliners, in the NCP, the SPLM, the Dinka Ngoc and the 
Misseriya communities are gaining the upper hand and that the 
moderate leaders who have cooled things down so far are losing their 
credibility and will be drowned out. Each flare up makes an eventual 
compromise harder to achieve. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Hapsburg argued that the international community needs to 
lay down a strong marker on Abyei immediately, first because if it 
does not, it will send a message to the NCP that it can continue to 
let the problem fester and that the outside world does not care. 
Second, it will send a message to the SPLM likewise that the outside 
world does not care and that it will have to act unilaterally (and 
militarily) to resolve the issue. In a separate conversation, an 
AMCIT advisor to the SPLM told Conoffs that he believes that the 
SPLM does not want to do the "wrong" thing in Abyei, but following 
what happened last week it is under tremendous pressure to do 
something, right or wrong, if no one else does.

¶12. (SBU) Although the precise details of the fighting May 20 remain 
murky, it is clear that both sides played a role in the escalation 
of violence. The situation in Abyei the morning of May 21 is 
relatively calm, however tensions could flare at any moment. Calls 
made by Special Envoy Williamson to both parties late on May 20 
should help calm the situation. Continued engagement on Abyei will 
be necessary to avoid further conflict.
