¶1. As of April 28, we are aware of one confirmed case of 
swine flu in Spain, a 23 year-old recently returned to Spain 
from Mexico.  He is hospitalized in Almansa, Albecete, and 
the press reports his condition is "evolving favorably."  The 
Spanish national health service reports another 26 cases 
under investigation (four in Madrid, ten in Catalonia, and 
the rest scattered throughout the country).  There are no 
reports of human to human transmission.  Regularly scheduled 
commercial flights continue to arrive as normal from Mexico. 
Contact information is being collected from arriving 
passengers on those flights in case follow-up is required. 
The Spanish public health system, which is very capable and 
with which we have good contacts, reportedly has enough 
antivirals in stock to treat two million patients.  The 
Madrid regional government has put in place a system whereby 
those with flu-like symptoms are encouraged to stay home and 
call 112 (the Spanish 911). Healthcare workers are then 
dispatched to collect blood samples. 
 
¶2. Post's pandemic influenza working group (joined by the 
Regional Medical Manager who was here TDY for unrelated 
reasons) met April 28 to review the situation, our tripwires, 
and Embassy Health Unit procedures.  The Health Unit has 
adequate stocks of antivirals and personal protective 
equipment.  We will issue a staff notice on the situation, 
update our Embassy website, and provide Americans with links 
to the CDC and Spanish Ministry of Health websites 
(www.msc.es).  We will continue to monitor the situation in 
Spain closely and will take further additional steps as 
necessary.
