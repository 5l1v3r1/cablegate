SUBJECT: MALDIVES WILL VOTE WITH U.S. IN UNGA THIRD 
COMMITTEE ON BURMA AND DPRK, BE ABSENT FOR IRAN 
 
REF: A) STATE 117901 B) STATE 93981 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed reported to 
Ambassador that Maldives would vote against the no-action 
resolutions on Burma and DPRK and vote in favor of the 
resolutions.  However, citing a common stand taken by the 
Organization of Islamic Countries, Shaheed said Maldives 
would not be able to vote in a similar way on the Iran 
resolution.  Instead, the FM instructed his UN delegation to 
be absent during both the no-action motion as well as the 
resolution itself.  Embassy understands that this represents 
an improvement in Maldives' position on Third Committee 
resolutions since last year.
