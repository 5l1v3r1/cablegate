SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (11/17): Palestinian Authority 
announces is has begun to seek support for a unilateral declaration 
at the UNSC 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The three dailies report on Palestinian Liberation Organization 
(PLO) Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat announcing yesterday that the 
efforts to issue a UN Security Council resolution recognizing the 
Palestinian state on the 1967 borders has begun. The coverage notes 
that the Palestinian Authority (PA) officially asked the European 
Commission to support this step and issue an international 
resolution that recognizes the Palestinian state. Al-Hayat Al-Jadida 
reports on the Congressional delegation visiting Israel saying that 
the US will veto such a resolution at the UNSC. Al-Quds reports on 
Ian Kelley saying that the US supports the creation of a Palestinian 
state and that the best way to achieve it is via negotiations. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages news on Hamas leader Salah 
Al-Bardaweel as saying that the PLO Central Council is illegitimate 
and that Hamas will not accept any transfer of the Palestinian 
Legislative Council responsibilities to the Council. 
 
Al-Ayyam front pages news on Israeli officials reiterating that 
Israel will take unilateral steps if the Palestinians declare a 
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state without Israel's 
approval. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is quoted as saying that 
"any unilateral step will lead to a unilateral response from the 
Israeli side" and he urged the Palestinians to return to 
negotiations without preconditions.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Hani Al-Masri opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title "The Recognition of the State is Not Enough, We Need an 
Alternate Strategy" (11/17): "The Palestinians should pursue their 
efforts towards the unilateral declaration of the state ... In the 
meantime, they should work on a strategy that ensures the 
implementation of national goals ... the negotiations are no longer 
an option after the failure of negotiations over the past years." 
 
2) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title 
"Going Back to Dialogue" (11/17): "Egyptian sources have noted 
lately that Egypt will invite the Palestinian factions for another 
round of national reconciliation dialogue after the Al-Adha feast to 
discuss the Egyptian plan without any amendments ... however, let's 
not be optimistic as usual and hope that an agreement will be 
reached after this dialogue session. Let's only expect progress 
since nothing has changed in the positions of Fatah and Hamas."
