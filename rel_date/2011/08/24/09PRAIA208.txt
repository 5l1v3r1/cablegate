SUBJECT: DENGUE FEVER EPIDEMIC IN CAPE VERDE 
 
¶1.  In a meeting on October 29 with the Diplomatic Corps in Cape 
Verde, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of 
Health provided information about the mushrooming epidemic of 
dengue fever that is afflicting the country.  The following 
details were provided: 
 
--there are over 3,700 suspected cases in Cape Verde; 
--42 cases have been confirmed through blood sample testing in 
Dakar, Senegal; 
--three victims have developed hemorrhagic of dengue fever but 
are not in critical condition; 
--the World Health Organization has sent two teams with lab 
equipment to help provide the capability for the GoCV to start 
performing testing in Cape Verde; 
--the islands of Santiago (the location of the capital city of 
Praia) and the smaller neighboring island of Maio have the vast 
majority of the cases.  However, suspected cases are starting to 
appear on other islands; 
--the epidemic is expected to continue, and worsen, until the 
unseasonably warm temperatures and high humidity decline, 
causing mosquito populations to decrease. 
 
¶2.  The Embassy's Medical Unit has provided Mission employees 
with comprehensive information about prevention methods and 
mosquito breeding mitigation.  One dependent of one LES employee 
has been confirmed to have Dengue.  Other diplomatic missions in 
Praia also have reported confirmed cases among their employees, 
with the Portuguese Embassy and the UN mission each having 
multiple victims. 
 
¶3.  Also discussed was the increasing number of Malaria cases 
being reported in Cape Verde during this rainy season.  The 
annual average of 100 cases has already been exceeded; the 
Health Ministry promised to circulate concrete data soon.  The 
Director of the Fight Against Malaria program reported that 
there are currently 32 cases of malaria but expect over 100 
cases. 
 
¶4.  It is important to mention that at this moment, Cape Verde 
is facing three (3) potentially epidemic conditions:  Dengue 
Fever (current serotype found in CV is DEN-3), Malaria, and 
Influenza A/H1N1.  The first two conditions are closely related 
to the rainy season and mosquito proliferation.  Because the 
rainy season usually ceases in November, there are expectations 
that the Malaria and Dengue Fever epidemics may last up to 
December/January.  Close watch, self protection, and medication 
may be imperative during this time.  Because the potential for 
Malaria drugs epidemics is unpredictable, post's medical doctor 
recommended the use of anti-malaria for the next two months. The 
most commonly used prophylactic drugs are:  Malarone, Mefloquine 
(Larium) 3198, Doxycycline, Primaquine, and Coartem; however, 
only Mefloquine and Doxycline are available locally. 
 
¶5.  A large outdoor public evening event for this weekend has 
been canceled as a result of the Dengue epidemic.  Post will 
provide further updates as appropriate.
