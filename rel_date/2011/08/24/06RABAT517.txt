¶1.  This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U)  On March 16, the GOM announced parliament's passage 
of a new law against torture, according to the 
English-language Morocco Times.  The Minister of Justice, 
Mohammed Bouzoubaa, reportedly said, "The new law against 
torture is part of a judicial arsenal which reinforces the 
respect of human rights principles."  While the penal code 
already sanctioned torture, the minister said the new law 
shows "no mercy towards torturers." 
 
¶3.  (U)  According to the press account, the new law controls 
judicial police activities, provides medical expertise and 
lawyer assistance for people in custody.  Bouzoubaa 
emphasized that the corruption in the judicial system would 
cease.  He reportedly said,  "a network of swindlers was 
composed within the justice administration." 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Comment:  A new law against torture has long been 
promised, having been forecast by PM Jettou two years ago. 
The parliamentary passing of an anti-torture law is timely. 
The Department's recently published human rights reports 
identify incidents of probable torture, both in the Western 
Sahara and in detention facilities elsewhere in the country, 
as documented by Amnesty International.  The law, along with 
the minister's statements, indicate that the GOM wants to be 
understood as fighting corruption, improving the judicial 
system and complying with human rights standards.  We will 
track application of the new law and reaction within the 
human rights community and report as appropriate.  End 
Comment.
