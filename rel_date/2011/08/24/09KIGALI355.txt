(SBU)  Pol/Econ Counselor delivered reftel demarches June 11 
to Director General for Bilateral and Multilateral Affairs 
Joseph Kabakeza and International Organizations Director Ben 
Rutsinga.  On the mandate renewal for the Sudan Special 
Rapporteur (ref A), Kabakeza and Rutsinga listened carefully 
to talking points.  Although agreeing that the human rights 
situation in Sudan called for continuing attention, they 
responded cautiously to the concept of a mandate renewal, 
saying they would consult with other Africa Group members. 
On hearing the USG was moving toward joining the 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) (ref B), the 
two men welcomed USG interest in the agency.  They noted 
Rwanda had just joined IRENA (it became a signatory state on 
June 8).  They agreed the organization's mission should not 
overlap with existing initiatives.  On the question of the 
UAE hosting IRENA headquarters, the men were non-committal, 
saying the question called for further study.  On the 
L'Aquila Summit and food security (ref C), the men noted 
Rwanda's ongoing and extensive efforts to modernize its 
agricultural sector (which expanded by 20 percent in 2008), 
and agreed that national plans must be carefully coordinated 
with regional and international partners.
