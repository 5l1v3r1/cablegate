¶2. (U) Embassy Sofia's unofficial translation of the MFA's 
statement follows: 
 
"MFA Statement on Violence in Iraq 
February 24, 2006 
 
The Republic of Bulgaria expresses its concern over the 
continuing acts of violence in Iraq, as well as the attacks 
carried out against the religious symbols in that country. 
 
We condemn the bomb attack, which took place on February 
22nd, on the Askariya Mosque in Samarra--one of the holiest 
Shiite temples and part of the cultural and historical legacy 
of the Iraqi state.  Such terrorist acts are intolerable. 
Their only goal is to fan tensions between the religious 
communities in the country and to drag it into civil war. 
 
We call upon all groups in Iraqi society to demonstrate 
self-control and to respect the law which will allow the 
Iraqi state to accomplish the building and strengthening of 
its democratic institutions."
