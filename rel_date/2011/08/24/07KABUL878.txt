SUBJECT: PRT LASHKAR GAH: HELMAND: TWO SUICIDE BOMBINGS, 
PRTOFF VEHICLE HIT 
 
¶1.  (SBU) At about 1115hrs on March 13, approximately one 
mile south of the PRT, two DynCorp vehicles (attached to the 
Poppy Elimination Program (PEP) coming from Bost airfield and 
driving to the Lashkar Gah PRT in Helmand were the targets of 
an IED attack.  It has not been confirmed whether it was a 
suicide body-borne or an ordinary IED, but the spray pattern 
of the bomb's ball-bearings in the vehicles appears 
consistent with a suicide IED attack (traces of what might be 
bits of burned flesh were also found on the vehicle).  An 
occupant of one of the vehicles believes he saw someone 
approach the vehicles immediately before the blast and, given 
the person's arm gestures, the occupant thought the person 
may have tossed items towards the vehicle; however, the 
pattern of damage may not support a "thrown IED".  Both 
vehicles sustained extensive damage and only one remained 
drivable.  The PRT's quick reaction force reached the convoy 
within approximately ten minutes and assisted with retrieval 
of the disabled vehicle. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) There were no serious casualties in the convoy. 
The (USCIT) leader of the DynCorp team sustained a cut to the 
head, which was treated at the PRT, and State PRTOff, who was 
in the front vehicle, was uninjured.  There are reports of a 
few injuries to Afghan civilians at the crowded intersection, 
with the Deputy Police Chief reportedly claiming two children 
and two laborers were wounded. (NOTE: Members of a separate 
DynCorp convoy later reported that they were at the PRT's 
gate at the time of the incident, having passed several 
minutes before through the same intersection where the IED 
detonated. END NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Approximately twenty minutes after and roughly 
three-quarters of a mile west of the first incident a second 
suicide bomber, on foot, detonated an IED at the entrance to 
the Afghan National Army compound as the ANA commander was 
entering in a vehicle.  An ANA soldier reportedly identified 
the bomber and fired warning shots, perhaps prompting the 
attacker to detonate prematurely; the bomber was the only one 
killed, with the commander and a sergeant receiving only 
slight shrapnel wounds.  (NOTE: There were reports of small 
arms fire in downtown Lashkar Gah, rumored at one point to be 
related to the first incident.  The convoy does not appear to 
have come under fire, and it is unclear whether it was 
related to the second incident. END NOTE.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Local press later carried claims attributed to the 
Taliban asserting that eight NATO soldiers were killed in the 
first incident, and ten ANA soldiers were killed in the 
second.  The Governor,s spokesperson will counter that 
message with the facts of the incidents (if not already done).
