SUMMARY 
 
------ 
 
¶1. (SBU) As part of a trip to research the impact of recent farm 
invasions, poloffs visited farms and farmers in central Zimbabwe on 
October 21 and 22 (septel).  On October 21, we met with Manie and 
Lucy Grove who, after battling to keep their property since 2002, 
were homeless just five days after we met them as the result of a 
ZANU-PF-led invasion.  Their farm is one of 78 included in the 
so-called "Campbell Case" in which the Southern African Development 
Community (SADC) Tribunal ruled in November 2008 that the seizure of 
the plaintiffs' farms violated the SADC treaty.  This latest 
incursion, and the dozen farmworkers it left homeless and 
unemployed, is just the latest page in a long and growing history of 
farm invasions that continue to render Zimbabwe incapable of feeding 
itself.  END SUMMARY.

Grove Farm Slowly Taken Over 
---------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 21, as part of a trip through central Zimbabwe 
to investigate recent farm invasions, we met with embattled farmers 
Mike Jansen and Hermanus "Manie" Grove and their family members. 
The Grove farm, Inogo Ranch, is protected under the SADC tribunal 
ruling and several Zimbabwean court orders.  (NOTE:  The SADC 
Tribunal ruled that the seizure of the Campbell's farm and that of 
77 other farms violated the SADC treaty in that Amendment 17 to the 
Zimbabwean constitution precluded access to the courts and the 
seizures themselves were racist.  END NOTE.)  Grove explained the 
history of his farm, which is typical of many of the farms currently 
under threat. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Groves, who were born in Zimbabwe, purchased the 1700 
hectare farm in 1990 when there was little on the land.  At the 
farm's peak, it employed 25 full-time and 30 seasonal employees to 
work the cattle, dairy, maize, wheat, and barley fields.  In 2002 
the Groves agreed to a deal with Midlands Provincial Governor Cephas 
Msipa and the provincial land committee to cede 1,200 hectares to 53 
families, including 100 hectares of irrigated land, and  five 
percent of their 2002 crop to new farmers.  In 2005, the Groves 
applied for reallocation of the remaining 500 hectares, according to 
new legislation.  Around the same time, a Mr. Marwisa arrived at the 
farm asserting that he had an offer letter from the government 
entitling him to the land.  In December 2005, a delegation of 
provincial and local officials visited the farm and told Grove he 
had a right to stay on the land, as he had already ceded land to new 
farmers. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Several months later, in 2006, local lawyer, ZANU-PF 
stalwart, and reported Emmerson Mnangagwa confidant, Martin Makonese 
visited the farm and asserted that he, too, had an offer letter for 
Qvisited the farm and asserted that he, too, had an offer letter for 
the property, including the home.  Throughout 2006 and 2007, the 
Groves and their ever-dwindling staff suffered beatings, arson of 
the barley crop, and continued disdain for court orders, largely at 
the instigation of Makonese and his two "farm managers" who forcibly 
took up residence on the farm.  For example, in November 2007, the 
Groves, their adult son and their staff were beaten by Makonese and 
Marwisa's hired gang of about 35 people.  Grove needed 13 stitches 
for a cut on his head.  Earlier this year, one of the farm workers 
suffered a broken arm after Makonese's men beat him.

Threats Escalate: 
"War Ends With War" 
------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Since February 2009, the legal battle and intimidation 
against the Groves have escalated.  On February 18, Manie Grove was 
summoned to appear in court the next day to face charges of 
illegally occupying state land.  Although the case was deferred to 
give his lawyer time to prepare for trial, Grove was arrested on 
Friday February 20 and held in jail over the weekend without charge. 
 During that time, Makonese told his family that if they paid 
US$25,000 to the magistrate, the case would be resolved.  The Groves 
refused and subsequently successfully moved the case to the Supreme 
Court, where it is still pending. 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Several weeks later, in March, the Groves' lawyer, Malina 
Matshiya, was arrested and held for five hours for her continued 
involvement in defending the Groves.  In May, several tons of 
soybeans, maize and sorghum were stolen from the fields.  The police 
continue to refuse to investigate theft, violence, and harassment on 
the farm.  When we met on October 21, the Groves told us that they 
were ready to plant this year's crops "yesterday," including barley 
which was already contracted to a local beer producer.  However, the 
continued disruptions and threats prevented them from planting 
anything for the coming season.  Grove showed us a picture of one of 
the buildings Makonese's men had taken over that was adorned with a 
ZANU-PF flag and threatening graffiti: "war ends with war."

Reprisal

¶13. (SBU) The day after we met the Groves in Kwekwe, a group of 
20-40 ZANU-PF supporters invaded their farm at 5:00 a.m.  The 
invaders arrived in a truck owned by Makonese and broke the lock to 
the yard that contains the Groves' home and workshop.  Lucie Grove 
told us that she saw one of her workers sprinting "for his life" 
from his compound to the forest as he was chased by three of the 
men.  His fate remains unknown.  Manie Grove and his son took turns 
attempting to reason with the group while Lucie Grove sat in the 
kitchen with a firearm, ready to defend herself if the group was 
able to enter the house.  According to the Groves, the men received 
fresh supplies of beer throughout the day delivered by Makonese's 
truck, which, when not occupied, was parked in the Groves' yard. 
The men reportedly continued to get louder and more belligerent 
throughout the day. 
 
¶14.  (SBU) The Groves' lawyer repeatedly sought help from the Kwekwe 
police, who refused to act, claiming they did not have a vehicle. 
(NOTE:  We spent roughly one hour in Kwekwe on October 22 and saw 
two police vehicles circulating in town.  END NOTE.)  In a meeting 
with Deputy Prime Minister Thokozani Khupe the morning of October 
Qwith Deputy Prime Minister Thokozani Khupe the morning of October 
22, the Charge raised the issue of the invasion of the Groves' farm. 
 Polecon chief did likewise in a phone call to Deputy Prime Minister 
Arthur Mutambara later in the morning.  Nevertheless at 6:00 p.m. on 
October 22, a lone police officer arrived to tell the Groves that 
there was nothing he could do. 
 
¶15. (SBU) On the morning of October 23, a leading ZANU-PF figure 
from Kwekwe known as Makumbe (possibly the local head of the war

veterans) arrived at the farm and told the Groves that they had to 
leave before sun-down or they would be forced off.  Before driving 
away he told Manie Grove that he was bringing the men "more beer and 
marijuana."

Al-Jazeera Confronts Makonese 
----------------------------- 
 
¶16. (U) That afternoon, a television crew from Al-Jazeera, led by 
Zimbabwean correspondent Haru Mutasa, went to Makonese's office in 
Kwekwe to ask him about the ongoing invasion.  At Mutasa's behest, 
Makonese accompanied her to the farm where he reiterated his claim 
that he had a right to the land, despite the SADC Tribunal's ruling. 
 He tried to portray the ZANU-PF supporters in the yard as peaceful, 
but the crowd of drunken men and their ZANU-PF flags indicated 
otherwise.

Grove Confronts Defiant Mnangagwa 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶17. (SBU) On the morning of Saturday October 24, Manie and Lucie 
Grove drove to the home of their Member of Parliament, Defense 
Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, to confront him about the ongoing land 
invasion.  Makonese, Makumbe, and other farm invaders in the 
Midlands and Masvingo areas, in particular, have been affiliated 
with the powerful minister.  According to the Groves' adult 
daughter, Mnangagwa told the Groves that he would not intervene or 
stop the eviction because the Groves had taken their court case to 
SADC (a reference to their participation in the Campbell case).  He 
asked the Groves, "Who do you think you are, taking the government 
to court?" 
 
¶18. (SBU) Shortly after the Groves returned to the farm, the men 
forced their way into the house and began throwing the Groves' 
personal belongings into the yard.  Throughout Saturday evening, 
Sunday, and Monday, the Groves were allowed to remove most personal 
belongings, their dogs and heirlooms from the home where they have 
lived for 30 years.  They are negotiating to remove the tools from 
their shed and remaining furniture from the house.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶19. (SBU) The events of October 22-24 marked the bitter end of the 
Groves' seven-year fight to keep their farm.  Although the legal 
battle still technically continues in court, ZANU-PF ultimately won 
the more important battle of physical force on the farm.  It appears 
increasingly clear that ZANU-PF, largely led by Mnangagwa and his 
cronies, is hell-bent on eliminating white farmers, regardless of 
the SADC Tribunal ruling and international pressure.  The Groves, 
like many other white farmers, tried every avenue available to them 
in order to protect their property and workers: Zimbabwean courts, 
regional courts, diplomatic pressure, the international press, and, 
Qregional courts, diplomatic pressure, the international press, and, 
finally, direct confrontation of Mnangagwa himself.  These sad 
events, while not new, are a reminder of just how far Zimbabwe has 
to go to bring things right again, and of the important role SADC 
could play in helping restore rule of law by pressuring ZANU-PF to 
respect both Zimbabwean and SADC courts.  END COMMENT.
