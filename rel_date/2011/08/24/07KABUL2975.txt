SUBJECT: LEAHY VETTING REQUEST: ANP RANK REFORM ANCOP POSITIONS, 
PART ONE OF THREE 
 
¶1. This is an action request; please see paragraphs 2 and 3. 
 
¶2. In order to comply with Leahy vetting requirements, this cable 
forwards the names and biodata of 50 Afghan National Police field 
grade officers selected for positions in the Afghan National Civil 
Order Police (ANCOP).  These names are submitted as part of the of 
ANP Rank Reform process. When there are individuals with one name: 
Post has made a good faith effort to ensure that these individuals 
actually only have one name.  For individuals for whom date of 
birth, ethnicity, and/or father's name is not available, Post has 
worked with CSTC-A and the MOI to retrieve this data.  Post will 
inform the Department immediately if additional data becomes 
available.  This is the first in a series of three cables. 
 
¶3. IMPORTANT NOTE:  The international community recently approved 
pay increases for ANP company grade officers (captains and 
lieutenants); however pay increases for the field grade ANP 
personnel will not be approved until completion of Rank Reform. 
Currently, ANP field grade personnel earn less than their ANA 
equivalents and experience lower moral as a result.  The ANP Rank 
Reform process will provide a critical turning point in these moral 
issues.  Post requests the Department's expedited vetting and 
response at the earliest feasible date.  Post appreciates 
Department's strong support for the completion of the ANP Rank 
Reform process.
