SUBJECT: TURKEY:  REPORT ON PKK VIOLENCE 
 
REF: ANKARA 3948 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on 
PKK violence in Turkey (see reftels).  Our primary sources 
for these reports are mainstream Turkish press services, such 
as the Anatolian News Agency, and international wire 
services.  While these sources are more reliable than most 
Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  Press servics sympathetic to the PKK, such as 
Neu-Isenburg People's Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, 
tend to report higher numbers of Turkish Security Forces 
casualties. 
 
¶2. (U) According to press reports, one member of the Turkish 
Security Forces was killed over the period July 3 - July 9. 
One civilian was killed and one civilian was wounded in 
separate terrorist incidents.  One PKK terrorist was killed 
during a clash with Turkish forces during te same period.
