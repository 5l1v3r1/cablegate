SUBJECT: FY 2007 AG BIOTECH OUTREACH - FRANCE 
 
REF: (A) 2006 State 202514; (B) PARIS 515 
 
¶1.  Summary:  There is a strong disconnect in France between 
farmers, consumers and politicians on the issues of need, 
utilization and implementation of biotechnology.  The Embassy can 
help create opportunities for stakeholders to explore their 
differences and find common ground for acceptance of biotech 
benefits. As France can serve as a stopping-off point for travel to 
key countries earmarked for the FY 2007 Biotech Outreach program 
(ref A), Embassy proposes that U.S. biotech speakers consider 
incorporating a stop in Paris or other French city in their travel 
plans.  We would be pleased to arrange meetings for the speakers 
with a range of French sophisticated stakeholders open to 
discussion, as well as public diplomacy events as appropriate. 
France is a key player in all major international talks related to 
biotechnology. The modest additional increment of a Paris step-over 
would bring tremendous potential benefits in getting our message out 
to a critical audience.  End Summary. 
 
Growing Interest for Ag Biotech in France 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Despite visible anti-biotech actions from activists, 
overly-cautious French authorities and reluctant consumers, French 
farmers increasingly accept agricultural biotechnology: the acreage 
planted for commercial biotech corn mushroomed from zero in 2004 to 
5,000 hectares in 2006 and could reach 50,000 hectares in 2007.  The 
Embassy is working with a number of U.S. ag biotech companies who 
enjoy support of farmers, but who have been targeted by anti-biotech 
activists (ref B). In addition, Embassy has developed a network of 
key contacts within the biotech sector, including regulatory 
authorities, research agencies, farmers groups, companies and the 
media who are open to discussion and eager to learn more about 
biotechnology and the U.S. system. 
 
Suggestions for Actions in FY 2007 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. With presidential and parliamentary elections this spring, 
Embassy considers 2007 to be a key year to underscore the promise of 
biotechnology in France.  Although we recognize that France is not 
listed as a key country (REF A), we would like -- to the extent 
possible -- to take advantage of any opportunities presented by the 
Biotech Outreach program. As France is involved in international 
discussions on biotech (Catagena Protocol, Codex Alimentarius, WTO 
negotiations), French audiences and opinion makers would benefit by 
more discussion on the topic. 
 
¶4.  As several countries geographically close to France are listed 
as key ones for the FY 2007 Biotech Outreach (Germany, Czech 
Republic, Romania, Ukraine, Russia and Tunisia), we propose that 
U.S. biotech speakers traveling to these countries under the Biotech 
Outreach program consider incorporating a stop in Paris within their 
agendas. We would undertake to arrange meetings with a range of 
stakeholders or one-on-one meetings, depending on the issues 
involved. 
 
Example of Successful Past Actions 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶5. The French audience in September 2005 at a round table discussion 
with Madelyn Spirnak, senior DOS advisor for agricultural 
biotechnology, was very positive; we continue to receive favorable 
comments about this event. 
 
¶6. While Embassy attempts to engage on all fronts, we would benefit 
by more frequent expert speakers in France to advance the GMO 
dialogue, a key MPP objective supported by several Embassy sections. 
 
 
¶7. Note: This cable responds to ref A specifically seeking program 
suggestions for EB funds.  Post would coordinate any program so 
funded with its established PD speaker program (through IIP).
