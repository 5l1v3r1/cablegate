Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with 
Aleksandr Ilyin, Deputy Head of the Information and 
Communications Department and Igor Solovyev, Head of 
the Information and Communications Department. 
 
¶4. The SCC was founded 15 years ago as part of the 
establishment of the Russian Federation.  The court 
traces its roots back to the Tsarist era, when 
Commercial Courts of the Tsar were established for the 
administration of commercial law and codes.  Currently 
the Commercial Court has a four-tiered system 
consisting of 113 local and regional courts, with the 
SCC as the court of final appeal in the process.  The 
SCC is also the administrative headquarters for the 
system.  The SCC works closely with the U.S. Embassy 
on several programs regarding international commercial 
issues and jurisprudence.  The SCC employs around 500, 
and is located in the city center of Moscow. 
 
¶5. The SCC received and has loaded on to their system 
the software and equipment noted in reftel to secure 
the Court's computer network.  The network links all 
113 subordinate courts to the SCC.  Ten specialists 
have routine access to the servers, which are located 
on the first, fourth and fifth floors, respectively. 
The optical network and one of the Internet servers 
was funded by a project of the World Bank.  The team 
was shown three server stacks, where the software is 
being utilized.  The two Supervisor Engines as noted 
in reftel were racked in the fourth floor and fifth 
floor server racks. 
 
¶6. The server rooms are all located in controlled 
access areas, and rooms are locked with both standard 
key locks and a proximity card security system.  The 
building is guarded at all times by an armed security 
police unit, and has an electronic security system. 
The authorized users of the system are all employees 
of the Commercial Court system; there are no users on 
the network who are not affiliated with the court. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Supreme Commercial 
Court, Moscow, Russia as reliable recipients of 
sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
