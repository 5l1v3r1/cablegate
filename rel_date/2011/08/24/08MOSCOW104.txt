SUBJECT: ATOMSTROYEXPORT TO BUILD NUCLEAR PLANTS IN BULGARIA 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  AtomStroyExport will sign a six billion 
dollar contract to construct two third-generation nuclear 
reactors in Bulgaria.  The signing will take place on January 
18 during President Putin's visit to Bulgaria.  As part of a 
joint venture with Areva and Siemens, AtomStroyExport will be 
the prime contractor for the reactors.  Rosatom Director 
Kiriyenko has lauded the contract as signifying Russia's 
entry into the EU market for nuclear power plant 
construction.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Background:  The Soviet Union began construction 
of the Belene nuclear power plant in 1987.  At the request of 
the Bulgarian government, work ceased in 1991.  In November 
2006, Bulgaria and Russia signed a Letter of Intent to resume 
construction.  The EU did not agree to the project until late 
¶2007. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Alexey Ubeev, Deputy Director of External 
Relations of AtomStroyExport (ASE) confirmed to us January 16 
that ASE would sign a six billion dollar contract to build 
two third-generation nuclear reactors at the Belene site. 
The signing will take place on January 18 during President 
Putin's 2-day state visit.  While he would not elaborate on 
the details of the contract, Ubeev did say that ASE would be 
the primary contractor and that Areva and Siemens would be 
the European partners.  Russia will provide and install the 
reactor vessels and the turbines, with all of their 
associated hardware.  As part of the joint venture, Areva 
(France) and Siemens (Germany) will design, provide and 
install digital instrumentation and control systems, 
electrical equipment and some safety systems for the project. 
 Ubeev told us that all the work completed before the 1991 
construction halt would have to be removed to bring the plant 
up to contemporary standards.  This conforms with a recent 
statement by Rosatom Director Kiriyenko that the design of 
any nuclear power plants built in the EU would be in full 
compliance with EU safety standards. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Ubeev indicated that once the contract is signed, 
construction should begin later in 2008.  The goal is to have 
both reactors operational by 2014.  He mentioned that 
Kiriyenko had praised the contract as representing Russia's 
entry into the EU market for nuclear power plant construction.
