Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds leads with reports on the killing by Israeli military of a 
farmer in Gaza, following an explosion on the Israeli side of the 
Kissufim crossing that killed one Israeli soldier and wounded three 
others.  Commenting on the incident, Al-Ayyam's front page notes 
that the "fragile" Gaza truce has been dealt another blow. 
Meanwhile, Al-Quds leads with, and other papers front-page, January 
27 remarks by Palestinian Authority President Abbas, in which he 
questions both Hamas' interest in Palestinian national dialogue and 
Israel's interest in peace.  Abbas is quoted criticizing Palestinian 
opposition groups abroad and vowing to pursue prosecuting Israel for 
war crimes committed in Gaza. 
 
Al Ayyam's front-page cites AFP in reporting that Special Envoy 
George Mitchell arrived in Cairo on January 27 as part of his 
regional tour that will include visits to Egypt, Israel, the 
Palestinian Territories and possibly Turkey.  The paper further 
notes that Mitchell arrived in the region with a mandate from 
President Obama to conduct "active and fruitful" diplomacy in 
seeking regional peace. 
 
All dailies run lengthy quotes from President Obama's January 26 
interview with Al-Arabiya in front and inside page coverage. 
Leading with the story, Al-Ayyam highlights an Obama quote urging 
Palestinians and Israel to resume peace negotiations.  All papers 
highlight the President's, "commitment to his election promises" 
regarding the Middle East, noting that Special Envoy George Mitchell 
is traveling to the region as a sign of the Administration's keen 
interest in Middle East issues.  Papers also highlight Obama's 
statement to Muslims that, "Americans are not your enemy," and 
highlight that Obama's remarks stressed the need to "accurately 
define terrorism and differentiate between terrorism and Islam." 
 
Al Ayyam's front page cites Reuters in quoting Secretary Clinton 
stating during a press conference on January 27 that Israel has the 
right to defend itself against Palestinian rocket attacks, "which 
are getting closer and closer to populated areas." The paper 
comments that Clinton's remarks could be interpreted by some parties 
as, "giving Israel a green light," to attack Gaza. 
 
In other front page Gaza news, Al-Ayyam reports that Hamas and 
Islamic Jihad have set pre-conditions for national unity talks with 
Fatah, including the conclusion of a truce agreement with Israel and 
the reopening of Gaza crossings.  Meanwhile, Al-Quds and Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida front page reports on Hamas failing to deliver on its 
promise to "fully compensate war victims" in Gaza by distribution 
cash payments much smaller than originally promised.  In a separate 
story, Al-Quds cites Reuters when quoting Egyptian Foreign Minister 
Al Ghayt warning Europe not to send navy ships to patrol the Gazan 
shore because, "this could severely harm relations with Arab 
countries."-------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1)  Al Quds publishes a letter by the Palestinian People's Party 
Secretary General Bassam Salhi, titled, "An open letter to Mr. 
George Mitchell for a real peace..."(01/28):  "Respected Mr. George 
Mitchell, should you support a Palestinian rescue government that 
would be a government of national unity, headed by President Abu 
Mazin and would include all factions, even the Hamas movement; and 
should that government commit to a ceasefire in Gaza and the West 
Bank under conditions acceptable to the Palestinians thereby paving

the way for a different, serious political process... maybe you will 
be able to... make real progress towards peace, a peace that is 
based on international norms and standards, not the peace that 
Israel continually seeks to make..." 
3)  Hani Habib opines in Al Ayyam under the title, "Mitchell and the 
settlement impasse"(01/28):  "The Israelis are worried about 
Mitchell's role because of his view that Israeli settlements are the 
impasse, blocking a solution, and because he might again express 
this view in a way that will embarrass Israel.  However, the major 
[Israeli] concern is... [that Obama] will impose a settlement [on 
Israel] after friendly and diplomatic mediation efforts fail".
