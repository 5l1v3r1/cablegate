SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (01/29): Clashes continue between 
settlers, Israeli soldiers, and Palestinians in the West Bank 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
-------------The three dailies lead with confrontations between 
settlers, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian journalists in Burin 
village near Nablus. The journalists, who were covering a 
tree-planting event sponsored by the Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Ministry of Agriculture, said they were accosted by Israeli forces 
who declared the area a closed military zone. 
 
The dailies run headlines quoting President Obama saying yesterday 
that the US would always ensure Israel's security, but that 
Washington must also pay attention to the plight of the Palestinian 
people. Obama reiterated the US commitment to resume meaningful 
negotiations between the two parties as soon as possible. 
 
Al-Quds reports that PLO Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat denied news 
that PA President Mahmoud Abbas submitted new ideas and proposals to 
the US to revive the peace process. 
 
Independent daily Al-Quds reports on PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 
noting from Davos that the US and the international community must 
exert more pressure on Israel to stop settlement activities in the 
West Bank to push the peace process forward. Fayyad expressed 
disappointment that neither the US nor the international community 
were able to force Israel to stop expanding settlement activities. 
 
Reports note that Hamas expects the German mediator in the prisoner 
exchange deal to relinquish his role because of Israeli 
stubbornness.

Palestinian Cyberspace: 
----------------------- 
 
This week, Palestinian cyberspace focused on the request by 54 US 
Congressmen to lift the siege on Gaza, and the arrests of 
Palestinian peace activists. 
 
Palestinian social media carried the vlog (Video Blog) posted on 
palestinevideo.blogspot.com about the congressional legislation to 
label Arab satellite channels that promote incitement as Foreign 
Terrorist Organizations. To view the vlog, click here: Freedom of 
Speech and US Congress Bill to Gag it 
 
Palestine cyberspace circulated a song composed by Gazans to Obama 
titled "Gaza Voices: Gaza Kids are calling for Obama."

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
Saleh Qallab writing in Al-Quds under the title "Mitchell's Latest 
Visit, Was It a New Beginning or a Big Failure?" opines that Special 
Envoy Mitchell's latest visit did not fail completely because he was 
able to achieve some progress. The writer notes, however, that no 
breakthrough was achieved because the Palestinians and Arab states 
insist that Israel must stop settlement activities.
