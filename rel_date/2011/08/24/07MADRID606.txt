     ¶B. 2006 MADRID 3978 
 
¶1. (SBU) Alcy Frelick of CA/P/IP and Richard Kopel and Mary 
Draper of the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) visited Madrid 
March 27 to meet with officials from Spain's National Center 
for Anti Terrorist Coordination to discuss implementation the 
HSPD-6 terrorist lookout data exchange between the U.S. and 
Spain (REF A).  Frelick, Kopel, and Draper were accompanied 
to the CNCA by the Consul General and by representatives from 
Legat and from the Political Section.  The USG visitors 
briefed the CNCA on the U.S. policy framework that guided 
HSPD-6 exchanges with other countries and responded to 
specific technical questions from the CNCA regarding how the 
"Madrid Model" for this data exchange will function in 
practice.  The CNCA provided an extensive briefing regarding 
Spanish counter terrorism efforts and how the CNCA believed 
an HSPD-6 exchange could be managed by the CNCA. 
 
//NEXT STEPS// 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following a discussion of the technical issues 
surrounding implementation of the agreement, participants 
agreed to: 
 
-- Establish an "Operational Protocol" that would serve as 
the written guideline for both parties in managing lookout 
data shared by the two parties.  The CNCA agreed to work from 
a White Paper provided by the USG as the basis for this 
Protocol and agreed to provide Spain's input and suggested 
language to the U.S. side during the month of April. 
 
-- Establish clear definitions of the terms to be used by 
both sides in implementing the data exchange.  These 
definitions will be included in the Protocol and will help 
each party understand the nature of the data being shared by 
the CNCA and the TSC. 
 
-- Exchange letters once a Protocol had been agreed to by 
both parties, formalizing implementation of the Protocols. 
 
-- Set a target date of May 2007 for implementation of the 
HSPD-6 data exchange. 
 
¶3. (SBU) CNCA representatives indicated that the USG team had 
answered their procedural/technical questions regarding the 
data exchange.  They indicated that the Protocol would 
require the approval of Spain's data privacy protection 
agency, which the CNCA would endeavor to obtain as quickly as 
possible. 
 
¶4. (U) Post greatly appreciates the visit of the CA and TSC 
team, and the readiness of Washington agencies to provide 
additional technical advice and support as we move towards 
implementation of the Madrid Model.
