SUBJECT: KUWAIT SENDS IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO IRAQ BRIDGE 
STAMPEDE VICTIMS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The GOK responded immediately to the August 31 
Bridge of the Imams stampede in Baghdad, by sending a fully 
equipped ambulance and 500 first aid kits to Iraq the next 
day.  On September 3, the aid continued as six truck loads 
carrying twelve tons of medical supplies began driving north. 
 Acting Health Minister, Ahmed Abdullah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber 
Al-Sabah, directed by Prime Minister Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmed 
Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, and with assistance from the Kuwait Red 
Crescent Society, had both shipments delivered to the Iraq 
Red Crescent Society in Safwan, a border town, by September 
¶3.  In addition, on September 4, the Council of Ministers 
authorized $10 million dollars in aid, half to the Iraqi 
government and half to the families of the victims of the 
stampede.  The money for the families will be sent to the 
Iraq Red Crescent Society for disbursement. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The immediate response from Kuwait counters local 
press reports that state Iraqi Shi'a are disappointed by the 
"silence" of Arab countries to the stampede tragedy, which 
left close to a thousand dead.  According to Al Seyassah and 
Al-Rai Al-Am newspapers, members of the Iraq National 
Assembly spoke openly about the "Arab silence" since the 
tragedy, expressing frustration at the lack of offers for 
assistance.
