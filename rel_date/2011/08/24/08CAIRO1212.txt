(SBU) On June 11, MFA Spokesman Hossam Zaki told the DCM that 
the GOE would have to "think hard" whether to receive a 
delegation from the government of Kosovo to Egypt.  He 
emphasized that he was not rejecting the proposal; "this 
would have to be weighed."  MFA Deputy Director for East and 
South Europe and the Balkans, Ahmed Hamdy Bakr, elaborated on 
June 12, saying that because Egypt has not recognized Kosovo 
(reftel), the GOE could not receive such a delegation "in its 
official capacity."  However, he noted that the MFA is in 
regular contact with the self-declared Ambassador of Kosovo 
in Cairo at the Deputy Assistant Minister level in an 
"unofficial" capacity.  The GOE might consider receiving a 
delegation from Kosovo in the same vein, he said, but noted 
that he could give no guarantees.
