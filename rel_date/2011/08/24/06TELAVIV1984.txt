¶1.  (SBU) Minister of Justice Haim Ramon told the Ambassador 
May 16 that he would try to play a constructive role in 
addressing USG concerns about protection of intellectual 
property rights.  Ambassador Jones expressed USG concern 
about Israel's poor performance in protecting the patents of 
U.S. pharmaceutical products, among other American exports, 
which led USTR to place Israel on its priority watch list for 
the second year in a row. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador also stressed the importance of 
Israel enforcing the norm of "national treatment," by 
guaranteeing that American copyright holders receive the same 
treatment in Israeli markets that Israeli rights holders 
receive.  He then asked Ramon to make passage of the draft 
copyright bill a high priority for the new Knesset.  Ramon 
said that he will chair the May 21 government legislative 
committee meeting that will decide which bills from the 
former Knesset will advance to the new Knesset under the "law 
on legislative continuity."  "We will approve it" for 
consideration by the new Knesset, Ramon said.  Ramon then 
asked to receive "a paper on all U.S. government concerns on 
copyright issues, in its broadest aspect."  In coordination 
with USTR, Post plans to provide this paper to Ramon on May 
¶22. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Other issues covered in the meeting -- including 
convergence, illegal outposts, trafficking in persons, Magen 
David Adom, and nationality and entry -- are covered in 
septels.
