SUBJECT: SPAIN REQUESTS MUTUAL CANDIDATE SUPPORT FOR WORLD 
HERITAGE CONVENTION 
 
 
¶1.  This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2. Embassy Madrid received the following note verbale from 
the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs June 3 (the note is 
dated May 27).  Informal embassy translation of the main 
points is as follows: 
 
   The Government of Spain has decided to present a candidate 
for the World Heritage Committee and notes that elections for 
this committee will take place next October in the General 
Assembly of the World Heritage Convention.  The Foreign 
Ministry has learned that the U.S. government will also be 
presenting a candidate for this committee.  The GOS proposes 
that the USG consider the possibility of mutually supporting 
each others' candidates for this committee.  The GOS hopes 
that the USG gives strong consideration to its proposal. 
 
End translation. 
 
¶3. Post requests Department guidance on the appropriate 
response to this proposal.
