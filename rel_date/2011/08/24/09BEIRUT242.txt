Atmospherics: 
------------- 
 
All media outlets highlighted the inauguration of the Special 
Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) at The Hague.  Media outlets devoted full 
pages to the statements that were delivered and for photos of the 
building that will include the courtroom, the investigators' 
offices, other employee offices, and the prison.  The press also 
highlighted statements, impressions, and emotions displayed by the 
families of the politicians and journalists who were assassinated 
following Hariri's assassination, over the inauguration of the 
tribunal.  Most expressed satisfaction with the fact that the 
tribunal has commenced its operations, but also noted that it will 
not bring their loved ones back.

"After the Tribunal," an editorial by Talal Salman in Arab 
nationalist As-Safir (3/2): 
 
"The Lebanese breathed easily yesterday while watching the 
celebratory inauguration of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon 
(STL)...  The Lebanese, who are divided almost over 
everything,...are in agreement that the truth about Hariri's 
assassination and others...should be known.  ... Political history 
in Lebanon has been divided in two: before and after the Hariri 
assassination.  ...The investigation witnessed ups and downs...but 
what is important now is that everything is in order.  Yes, we may 
need years before the investigation and the tribunal are 
concluded...but the Lebanese have agreed that the international 
tribunal should be the only judicial authority to investigate and 
reach the truth about this huge crime.   Perhaps this tribunal, 
which is actually the first tribunal against terrorism,...may 
protect the future of the Lebanese in their own country..." 
 
"The Tribunal and Justice," an editorial by Aouni Al-Ka'ki in 
pro-Hariri Ash-Sharq (3/2): 
 
"Justice entered Lebanon on March 1.  ...The world is witnessing for 
the first time an international tribunal designed to stop political 
assassinations.  ...No doubt, March 1 is a victory for justice and 
not a day for revenge.  It is also a victory for the will to live - 
and (it) is a victory for Lebanon.  Many bet that this tribunal 
would never see the light, but their bets failed yesterday.  This 
international tribunal will be the line between crime and justice. 
...The Special Tribunal for Lebanon is not a normal event.  It is 
the beginning of a new phase, not only for Lebanon but for the whole 
world community.  ...Following this tribunal, political assassins 
will realize that they will no longer be able to escape 
punishment..."
