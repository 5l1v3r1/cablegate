REF: SECSTATE 47359 
 
ESTHOFF made reftel points May 7 to MFA Deputy Director 
General for International Technical Organizations Enrique 
Yturriaga, urging Spain to support U.S. positions at the May 
7-25 WMO Quadrennial Conference in Geneva.  Yturriaga offered 
the following comments keyed to the major areas outlined in 
reftel nonpaper: 
 
--  Getting Back to Basics -- Spain agrees with the U.S. that 
the WMO should remain focused on current priorities and 
should not expand into areas outside its core expertise. 
 
--  Scientific/Technical Priorities -- Spain strongly 
supports the U.S. emphasis on the importance of the WMO's 
Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation Program (DPM).  Spain 
does not have firm views on modeling, but notes that the EU 
has successfully integrated its member states' weather 
modeling outputs.  Expanding this sort of cooperation into an 
international ensemble model strikes Spain as logical and 
useful. 
 
--Convention Change --  While Spain sees some utility in the 
German proposal to catalogue fields in which the WMO is 
engaged, Spain agrees with U.S. concerns about the need to 
ensure that the WMO does not waste resources or reduce 
efficiencies by duplicating work already being carried out by 
other UN organizations.  Thus, Spain, like the U.S., has 
concerns about the German proposal to expand the WMO's 
purview.  Yturriaga added that Spain supports the French 
proposal to expand UNEP into the UN Environmental 
Organization (UNEO).  Spain thinks that it makes no sense to 
try to expand the purview of both UNEP and the WMO. 
Expanding the purview of one organization (UNEP to UNEO) 
should imply limiting the purview of other related 
organizations like the WMO.  Yturriaga said there was no/no 
consensus EU position on the German proposal.  He thought 
G-77 views might prove critical in determining the fate of 
the German proposal. 
 
--  World Climate Conference -- While giving no clear 
indication as to whether Spain would support or oppose a 
World Climate Conference, Yturriaga did stress that Spain 
shares our concerns about not wasting money by duplicating 
work already being carried out by other UN organizations. 
 
--  Program and Budget -- Yturriaga indicated that this was 
probably the greatest area of disagreement between Spain and 
the U.S.  Spain will not support a zero nominal growth budget 
and instead backs a "slight" increase in WMO funding.  Spain 
believes the WMO is engaged in important work (he again cited 
the DPM) and suggested that it was inconsistent for the U.S. 
to urge funding of its key priorities while at the same time 
pushing for a zero nominal growth budget. 
 
--  Governance -- Yturriaga was unaware of concerns about 
Member State access to WMO Executive Council documents and 
indicated that the Swiss proposal to reform this governance 
area appeared to make sense.  He thought Spain would support 
the Swiss initiative.  He also said Spain would support the 
U.S. idea to allow Member States to send observers to WMO 
Executive Council sessions.
