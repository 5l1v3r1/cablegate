¶1. Deputy Econ Counselor delivered ref B points and Special 301 
report language to Volodymyr Zharov, Deputy Chairman of the State 
Department of Intellectual Property, on May 8.  Zharov thanked the 
USG for its recognition of progress made in recent years, and said 
he hoped the GOU's further efforts to improve IPR protection would 
soon result in Ukraine moving off of the Priority Watch List.  He 
said he hoped Ukraine would have the opportunity to draw on U.S. 
technical expertise in effectively addressing difficult IPR 
problems, such as those identified in the Special 301 Report. 
 
¶2. Post understands that this information was also delivered by USTR 
to Deputy Minister of Economy Valeriy Pyatnytskiy during bilateral 
consultations in Washington on May 1 (ref A).
