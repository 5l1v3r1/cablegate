Closer Agricultural Ties Through Food Security 
 
1.(U) On January 14, 2010 Deputy Chief of Mission Theodore G. 
Osius met with Dr. Bayu Krisnamurthi, Deputy Minister, 
Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture to discuss options for 
greater cooperation in the agricultural sector.  Food security 
presents an opportunity to encourage greater U.S. private sector 
cooperation.  Bayu hopes for greater ties through agricultural 
education.  He also sought ways to resolve outstanding 
agricultural trade issues, although he acknowledged political 
limitations. 
 
 
Food Security 
------------- 
 
2.(U) Dr. Krisnamurthi stated that he wished to establish a 
mechanism for discussing agricultural issues with the United 
States.  He noted that these discussions could be about 
bilateral trade, food security, or other ways the United States 
and Indonesia could collaborate to achieve their "mutual potential" 
in agriculture.  With Dr. Krisnamurthi's 
encouragement, U.S. Ambassador Cameron Hume will host a food 
security roundtable on January 26, which will include Indonesian 
government officials, academia and members of the U.S. private 
sector, the roundtable will address potential the private sector 
roles in addressing Indonesia's food security challenges. 
 
¶3. (U) Following up on a previous suggestion from Dr. 
Krisnamurthi, the DCM stated that Post would like to hold a 
joint workshop with Indonesia in late March 2010.  The workshop 
will promote food security through increased capacity in 
agricultural technology and private investment.  The DCM asked 
that Dr. Krisnamurthi provide Post officials with a point of 
contact from his office for future coordination and planning 
activities.  Dr. Krisnamurthi stated that his primary 
responsibilities as the Deputy Minister of Agriculture is to 
promote investment in Indonesia's agricultural sector has been 
identified as a top priority for President Yudhoyono's second 
term. 
 
¶4. (U) Mr. Krisnamurthi noted that in the 1970s and 1980s, as 
many as 300 Indonesians received advanced degrees from U.S. Land 
Grant Universities under a USAID program.  He stressed that this 
program has been critical to Indonesia's food security and 
agricultural development, as well as fundamental for the United 
State - Indonesia bilateral relationship. 
 
 
Bilateral Trade of Agricultural Products 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The DCM thanked Dr. Krisnamurthi for the Ministry of 
Agriculture's November 2009 recognition of the U.S. food safety 
control system for all fresh foods of plant origin for a two- 
year period.  The DCM stated that this kind of bilateral 
engagement is critical to solving other outstanding issues in 
the trade of agricultural products, specifically citing 
challenges to U.S beef and pork exports to Indonesia.  He also 
requested that the Ministry of Agriculture work with its U.S. 
interlocutors to resolve trade issues prior to the visit of 
DUSTR Demetrios Marantis in February 2010. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Dr. Krisnamurthi acknowledged that he there are no 
animal science-based reasons for Indonesia to maintain its ban 
on U.S. fresh pork and pork products.  However, he is aware that 
it will be politically difficult to change the ban. 
 
¶7. (U) The DCM informed Dr. Krisnamurthi that U.S. officials are 
concerned that the Ministry of Agriculture has been noticeably 
absent from recent United States - Indonesia Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) discussions.   He 
encouraged the MOA to attend and participate at the next round. 
 
 
U.S. Agency for International Development Discussion Items 
 
¶8. (U) The USAID Mission Director informed Dr. Krisnamurthi that 
USAID is planning on a successor program for the Agribusiness 
Market and Support Activity (AMARTA) in Indonesia, which would 
have university partnership component.  Dr. Krisnamurthi stated 
that the Ministry of Agriculture is currently developing a new 
zootic committee, which will focus on other animal health issues, 
as well as Avian Influenza.
