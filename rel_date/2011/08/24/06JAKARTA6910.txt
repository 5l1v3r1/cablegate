SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) The GOI has raised its count of victims from the May 
27 earthquake to 6,234 dead and 46,148 injured.  No Americans 
appear among the dead or wounded.  Experts report that basic 
medical supplies remain in need.  USAID partners have 
surveyed water systems and sanitation conditions in afflicted 
areas; further USAID personnel and USAID-funded supplies 
should arrive in the quake area on June 1.  Approximately 80 
U.S. military personnel have arrived, and military aircraft 
continue to enhance our ability to assist survivors.  The 
U.S. military field hospital continues to treat patients 
while U.S. military doctors also assist local medical 
facilities.  The GOI has begun preparing a damage and needs 
assessment for the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI). 
Volcanic activity at nearby Mount Merapi has increased. The 
Ambassador's May 31 visit to the area (ref A) received 
substantial positive press coverage.  This cable also 
describes some relief activities of other governments, 
international organizations, and non-governmental 
organizations.  End Summary. 
 
CASUALTIES 
---------- 
 
¶2. (U) The GOI Department of Social Affairs, on June 1, 
revised its official count of earthquake victims to 6,234 
dead, 33,231 seriously injured, and 12,917 lightly injured. 
The Department of Social Affairs estimated 233,237 homes 
destroyed by the earthquake.  We have no reports of Amcits 
dead or injured or of unidentified foreigners at any medical 
facility.  We have resolved all w/w inquires concerning 
Americans reportedly in the Yogyakarta area. 
 
SITUATION IN YOGYAKARTA 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The Yogyakarta airport fully re-opened May 31. 
Yogyakarta city has begun to normalize, with businesses 
operating, and people returning to work.  In Yogyakarta, 
basic services have resumed, and the GOI has asked for school 
to commence June 1. Many parts of Bantul and Klaten, however, 
remain without electricity and piped water.  Communities in 
the affected areas have started to clear out debris, with 
looting reported in some areas. 
 
NEEDS 
----- 
 
¶4. (U) Indonesians participating in the relief effort 
indicated their greatest need remains medicines and medical 
equipment such as pins, rods, screws, and plates for fixing 
broken bones. While thousands of Indonesian tents are 
available for distribution, homeless persons badly need basic 
environmental protection equipment, such as mosquito nets. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that relief 
workers most need: orthopedic supplies, antibiotics, bed 
sheets, mattresses, and other consumable medical equipment, 
such as sterile kits for operations, stitching materials, 
x-ray film and pop plasters. 
 
U.S. CIVILIAN EFFORT 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) We anticipated the arrival in Yogyakarta on June 1 of 
a flight carrying USAID-funded relief supplies, consisting of 
four World Health Organization medical kits.  The kits will 
serve the basic first-aid needs of 120,000 people for one 
month. 
 
JAKARTA 00006910  002.2 OF 004 
 
 
 
¶6. (U) Four members of the USAID Disaster Assistance Response 
Team (DART) have arrived in Yogyakarta.  The remaining five 
technical experts arrive June 2. The DART will include 
specialists in water, sanitation and shelter; a 
communications officer; a program officer; and a military 
liaison. 
 
¶7. (U) USAID partner Environment Services Program (ESP) 
completed a water supply assessment in Bantul, Yogyakarta and 
Sleman.  Piped water supply in Bantul appears badly affected, 
with 10 out of 13 deep wells not functioning due to 
electricity failure or damage.  The earthquake appears not to 
have badly affected piped water supply systems in Yogyakarta 
city and Sleman.  Only 2 out of 35 deepwells in Yogyakarta 
have stopped functioning.  Technicians have begun repairing 
pipe leaks and other minor damage.  Shallow wells reportedly 
have dried up due to shifts in the aquifer.  The water supply 
system in Sleman functions normally.  The ESP team also 
conducted sanitation assessment in Yogyakarta city. 
 
¶8. (U) The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) has raised 
USD 30,000 for earthquake relief, and sent a representative 
to Yogyakarta to coordinate U.S. corporate relief efforts. 
AmCham has teamed up with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 
the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN) to 
help rebuild small handicraft producers located in the 
earthquake zone.  According to Minister of Trade Mari 
Pangestu, approximately 70 percent of Indonesia's handicraft 
industry, particularly batik producers, lies in and around 
Yogyakarta; the earthquake wiped out thousands of small 
businesses and entrepreneurs. 
 
U.S. MILITARY ACTIVITY IN EARTHQUAKE AREA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) We have approximately 80 U.S. military personnel on 
the ground in the earthquake area.  We expect a total of four 
KC-130 flights on June 1, which will expand the capacity of 
our military treatment facility.  We anticipate up to two 
possible C-17 flights on June 2. 
 
¶10. (U) Medical personnel at our treatment facility treated 
27 patients on the afternoon and evening of May 31.  They 
have continued to treat a continuous flow of patients on June 
¶1.  U.S. military doctors do basic clinic work on an ongoing 
basis, and perform significant outpatient procedures and 
surgeries.  The Embassy has provided two Indonesian staff, 
our RMO and a nurse to the treatment facility, and Embassy 
C-12 flew five additional Indonesian staff to the area on 
June 1 to provide translation services. 
 
¶11. (U) U.S. military doctors have gone to local medical 
facilities, assisting with treatment at those sites or 
routing/transporting some patients to our treatment facility. 
 
¶12. (U) At the request of the Indonesian Armed Forces, U.S. 
military doctors and Embassy military personnel visited the 
Klaten region to provide immediate care and conduct an 
assessment for future visits to rural regions. 
 
¶13. (U) A U.S.-led meeting of international military 
personnel should take place June 1, and include 
representatives of Thailand, Singapore, Australia, Japan, and 
possibly others. 
 
GOI PLANNING, COMPENSATION 
-------------------------- 
 
¶14. (U) The National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) 
will take the lead conducting a rapid damage and needs 
assessment in coordination with ministries and local 
government officials.  Bappenas expects to have the report 
prepared and ready to share with donors at the June 14 
Consultative Group for Indonesia (CGI) meeting.  With the 
 
JAKARTA 00006910  003.2 OF 004 
 
 
World Bank's assistance, the assessment will use the same 
format as in Aceh after the 2004 tsunami, describing the 
GOI's budget and operational plan for earthquake recovery and 
reconstruction. 
 
¶15. (U) The GOI plans to compensate victims of the earthquake 
as follows: 
 
- 3,258 USD (Rp. 30 million) per household for heavily 
damaged houses;

damaged houses; 
- 10.84 USD (Rp. 100,000) per person for clothing; 
- 10.86 USD (Rp. 100,000) per household for cooking equipment; 
- 0.32 USD (Rp. 3,000) per person per day for food. 
 
¶16. (U) The GOI has announced free restoration of electricity 
services to all earthquake-affected communities.  The 
Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) have deployed helicopters and 
2,000 tents from North Sumatra.
