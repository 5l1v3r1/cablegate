SUBJECT: RWANDAN RESPONSE TO FRENCH JUDGE'S ARREST WARRANTS 
 
REF: KIGALI 1110 
 
¶1.   (U) In response to press reports that a French judge had 
requested arrest warrants for nine senior GOR officials 
allegedly involved in the downing of the Juvenal Habyarimana 
presidential jet on April 6, 1994, the GOR on November 21 
formally denied its officials' involvement.  "There is no 
basis whatsoever to these allegations," said a Foreign 
Ministry statement. The statement accused the French 
government of attempting to "intimidate Rwanda using strong 
arm tactics" and to "hide the truth of France's involvement 
in the Genocide."  Further, by the issuance of arrest 
warrants, the French government intended to "pre-empt the 
findings" of a GOR Commission investigating France's role in 
events of 1994 and before: "France actively supported the 
Genocide and armed and fought alongside the forces that 
committed the genocide." 
 
¶2.  (U) In front-page remarks to the New Times government 
newspaper, Justice Minister Tharcisse Karugarama suggested 
that the request for international arrest warrants by the 
French judge was a "political" act, not in keeping with 
international norms, and done to "harass" and "intimidate" 
the Rwandan government.  "It is totally strange and very 
absurd that a foreign judge can issue an indictment" aimed at 
foreign leaders, for acts committed in "their own country." 
Karugarama suggested as well that the French government meant 
to forestall the investigations of the Rwandan Commission on 
French involvement in the genocide. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) At the opening session of the sixth annual Rwanda 
and Development Partners Meeting on November 22, before an 
audience of hundreds of diplomats, representatives of local 
and international NGOs, and senior GOR officials, President 
Kagame deviated from his welcoming remarks to harshly 
castigate the French government.  France was practicing a 
"justice of bullies," he said, and offering an "arrogant" 
face to the GOR.  Kagame did not address the substance of the 
French judge's claims, nor the judge's reported 
recommendation that Kagame himself be prosecuted by the 
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for his own 
supposed involvement in the destruction of the Habyarimana 
jet.  Some time later, at the mid-morning coffee break in 
tents on the lawn outside the hotel, Kagame appeared deep in 
conversation with French Ambassador Dominique Decherf. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In conversation with our DATT, also on November 22, 
senior GOR military officers expressed little concern over 
prospective travel plans, dismissing rumors circulating that 
Chief of Defense Staff James Kabarebe, reportedly one of the 
nine subject to the French arrest warrants, had postponed 
travel to Cameroon (in fact the DATT saw Kabarebe at the 
airport yesterday, proceeding to his scheduled flight). 
 
¶5.   (SBU) Comment.  The GOR has reacted with fury and 
condemnation, dismissing out of hand the French judge's 
attempt to secure the appearance of Rwandan officials at his 
inquiry into the shooting down of the Habyarimana plane.  We 
cannot judge the legality or appropriateness of the attempt, 
but the depth of anger on the part of the Rwandan government 
is palpable.  The GOR is dismayed by the timing of the action 
of the French judge, coming just after President Kagame 
completed successful visits to China and Europe.  In 
particular, Kagame just finished high level meetings with the 
EU in Brussels, including meetings with High Representative 
Javier Solana, which highlighted positive economic relations. 
 Coupled with the recent letter to the ICTR by Paul 
Rusesabagina requesting investigation of RPF offenses during 
and after the genocide (reftel), the GOR is feeling that once 
again "negative forces" are seeking to undercut its 
reputation and achievements. End comment.
