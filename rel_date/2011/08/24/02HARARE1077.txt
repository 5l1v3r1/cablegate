¶1.   Under headline "Sharon's war crimes" the ruling 
   ZANU PF weekly mouthpiece "The People's Voice" 
   dedicated its May 11 editorial to calling on President 
   George W. Bush to "condemn" Israeli Prime Minister 
   Ariel Sharon "for the massacre of Palestinian refugees 
   at Jenin."  Excerpts: 
 
¶2.   "The Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Sharon, has a 
   number of mass graves behind him.  In 1982, he 
   massacred many Palestinians in Lebanon.  Some 
   punishment should have been meted out to him then. 
   Now, he has repeated the same story in Jenin. . .  The 
   War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague should order the 
   public trial of Mr. Sharon for the massacre of 
   Palestinian refugees at Jenin. . .  The American 
   President, George W. Bush, should condemn Sharon in 
   very clear terms, and stop supporting his strategies of 
   war and murdering of Palestinians like wild animals. . 
   ."
