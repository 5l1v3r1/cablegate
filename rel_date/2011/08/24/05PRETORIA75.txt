SUBJECT: PRESIDENT SHOULD COMMEND MANDELA FOR HIS OPENNESS 
IN SAYING SON DIED OF AIDS IN CONDOLENCE LETTER, PHONE CALL 
 
¶1.  On Thursday January 6, Nelson Mandela told reporters at 
his home in Houghton that his son Makgatho, who had been 
hospitalized since late November, had died of AIDS.  Mandela 
noted that talking about such diseases was the only way to 
stop people from "regarding it as extraordinary and for 
which people will go to hell and not to heaven." 
 
¶2.  The acknowledgement from Mandela, given his stature and 
influence, is a courageous and critical contribution to 
reducing the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS in South Africa. 
For this reason, and in support of our strong partnerships 
in addressing AIDS in South Africa through the President's 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, we recommend that President 
Bush send a brief letter of condolence to former President 
Mandela.  A suggested text is provided below. 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Dear President Mandela, 
 
I write to convey my heartfelt condolences on the death of 
your son and eldest child Makgotho. 
 
Also, I commend your forthrightness in publicly announcing 
that the cause of Makgotho's death was HIV/AIDS.  Your 
disclosure will go a long way to destigmatizing AIDS, adding 
to your many contributions in addressing the challenges of 
AIDS. 
 
My government remains committed to working in partnership 
with the South African government and private sector in 
HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care through the 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. 
 
Laura and I send our personal condolences to you and your 
family and we will hold you in our prayers during this time 
of great sorrow. 
 
With deepest sympathy, 
 
 
George W. Bush 
 
END TEXT OF LETTER 
 
¶3.  We also encourage President Bush to consider phoning 
former President Mandela directly to convey his condolences 
and commend Mandela's candor in discussing the cause of his 
son's death.  The contact is Zelda La Grange, Private 
Secretary, 27-11-728-1000/1100.

¶4.  NOTE: Upon receiving news that Makgotho Mandela died 
earlier in the day, Charge immediately sent a letter of 
condolence.  Mandela made the disclosure about AIDS later in 
the day at his residence.  End note.
