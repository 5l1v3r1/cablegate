SUBJECT: DARFUR:  HUMANITARIAN MORATORIUM EXTENDED 
 
 
¶1.  On December 19, at a ceremony launching the UN Work Plan 
for 2007, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Kosti Manibe 
announced that the Government of National Unity (GNU) had 
extended the humanitarian moratorium through January 31, 
¶2008.  The moratorium eases requirements for visas, travel 
permits, and importation of relief commodities for 
non-governmental organizations working in Darfur, which would 
otherwise be subject to provisions of the Voluntary and 
Humanitarian Work Act of 2006. 
 
¶2.  The announcement was well received by the international 
community.  Charge Hume made three points on behalf of the 
USG:  he expressed appreciation for the extension, and said 
it would assist partners, including the United States, in 
addressing the pressing humanitarian needs of Darfur. 
Secondly, he pointed out his concerns on the deteriorating 
security situation in Darfur.  Finally, he urged the GNU to 
continue to meet its commitments to preparations for the 
election and census without delay.
