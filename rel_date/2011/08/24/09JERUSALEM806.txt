ANALYSES OF LAST 61 YEARS 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
All dailies lead with coverage of Palestinian Authority President 
Abbas' speech on May 14 on the occasion of the 61st anniversary of 
the Nakba [catastrophe].  President Abbas reiterated demands for an 
end to the Israeli occupation, the establishment of an independent 
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and the return of 
refugees based on the Arab Peace Initiative.  Abbas stressed that 
the demands are the minimum requirements for peace.  The dailies 
also report that several public and official Nakba events took place 
in the West Bank and Gaza on May 14.  In its lead photo, Al-Quds 
shows Palestinian children at Ayn Al-Hilwah refugee camp in Lebanon 
wearing traditional Palestinian costumes while reenacting, "the 
expulsion of Palestinians in 1948." 
 
All dailies run front page coverage of Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas' visit to Syria on May 14.  Abbas met with Syrian 
President Asad and discussed bilateral relations, the peace process, 
and Palestinian unity talks and issues' related to the new Israeli 
government.  The papers quote PLO Chief Negotiator Sa'eb Erekat 
noting that Asad supports the Palestinian cause and believes in the 
importance of a comprehensive, regional peace.  Palestinian factions 
in Syria told press that they will not meet with Abbas because they 
oppose, "his illegal and illegitimate acts [formation of Palestinian 
Authority government]," according to coverage. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page wire coverage about CIA Director Panetta 
conducting discrete talks with Israeli officials who assured him 
that Israel will not carry out a surprise attack on Iran. 
 
Al-Quds runs front page coverage citing Israeli daily Haaretz about 
continued Israeli expansion of the Ma'ale Adumim settlement near 
Jerusalem ,"despite U.S. opposition to expanding the settlement, 
particularly the E1 block."  The story notes that expansion would 
separate the West Bank from Jerusalem and, "eliminate chances of any 
peace settlement."  Al-Quds front pages a map published by Haaretz 
showing expansion plans for the settlement area.  In related news, 
an Al-Ayyam inside page reports that twenty armed Israeli settlers 
blocked the main Madama road south of Nablus on May 14, in an 
attempt to deny Palestinians' access to the city. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida run front page coverage of the 
Pope's visit to Nazareth on May 14, where he said mass for more than 
40,000 participants and called for peaceful coexistence between 
Muslims and Christian residents of Nazareth.  The Pope urged 
Christians in the city not to immigrate.  The Pope also met with 
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu who is quoted stating, "I asked the 
Pope to condemn the Iranian nuclear threat whose aim is to destroy 
Israel."  According to coverage, Israel rejected the Pope's request 
to allow the visit of 500 priests from Arab countries to holy sites 
in the Palestinian Territories. 
 
All front pages report that Palestinian Authority (PA) Premier 
Fayyad confirmed that the new PA government will not hinder 
Palestinian national dialogue.  Fayyad noted that a care-taker 
government is needed to ensure, "the daily needs of the people" 
until a unity government can be formed.  The statements were made 
during a ceremony inaugurating infra-structure projects in Tulkarim 
Governorate on May 14.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1)  Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, 
 
JERUSALEM 00000806  002 OF 002 
 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
"May 15 - 61 years later" (05/15):  "From May 15, 1948 to May 15, 
2009 Palestinians have experienced a long road of misery and 
catastrophe.  Thousands have been expelled; thousands have been 
killed, injured or imprisoned... International politics have served 
Israeli interests while international powers have supported Israel 
economically and politically.  In parallel to their endless support 
of Israel, they have asked the powerless Palestinians to negotiate 
with Israel ...61 years have passed and new generations of refugees 
have been created, despite international resolutions about their 
right of return.  We find that Israel denies all responsibility for 
this catastrophe and even worse, continues to accept thousands of 
new Jewish immigrants onto Palestinian lands!" 
 
2) Maha Al-Masri opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the tile, 
"After 61 years, has Israel succeeded to annul the right of return? 
(05/15):  "Because Israeli ideology encourages continuous 
[settlement] expansion, we find that Israel continues to refuse to 
recognize Palestinian refugee's right of return since Israel 
believes that the return of refugees would pose a threat to the 
Jewish state... this refusal shows that Israel is a racist country 
that wants only to preserve the Jewish race."
