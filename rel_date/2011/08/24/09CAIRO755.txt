Cairo, April 12th, 2009.  Your Excellency President / Barak 
Obama, President of the United States of America.  The 
Fifteenth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement will be convened 
in the City of Sharm El Sheikh on the 15th and the 16th of 
July 2009 under the Chairmanship of the Arab Republic of 
Egypt with the participation of the leaders of the NAM member 
states. 
 
I am confident that the upcoming summit will provide an 
excellent opportunity for a sincere and constructive dialogue 
allowing the NAM to formulate and develop its stances towards 
such priority issues as the global financial and economic 
crisis, food and energy security and financing for 
development.  The Summit will also consider how best to 
further enhance the Movement's role in a way that maintains 
its legacy of principles and accomplishments, while 
responding to the challenges of the current world order. 
 
In recognition of your important and constructive role on the 
international arena and in light of the political 
consultations between our countries regarding the different 
issues of the Summit's agenda, it is my pleasure to extend 
this invitation to your Excellency, to take part in the 
Summit's proceedings as a guest of the Movement's 
Chairmanship. 
 
I sincerely look forward to welcoming you in Sharm El Sheikh 
Summit.  Your personal participation, I am confident, will 
represent an invaluable contribution to its success and to 
consolidating the Non-Aligned Movement on the world arena. 
 
Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration along with my esteem and best regards. 
 
Mohammed Hosny Mubarak 
President of the Arab Republic of Egypt.
