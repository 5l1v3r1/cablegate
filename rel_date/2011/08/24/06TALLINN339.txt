REF: STATE 55459 
 
On April 7 Polecoff delivered reftel points on Hamas 
and the Council of Europe to Mai Jogimaa, MFA Middle 
East Desk Officer.  The GOE understands USG concerns, 
said Jogimaa.  The invitation by the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) to the PLC is 
unfortunate. But Jogimaa thought the more critical 
issue for the international community was how to 
ensure that Hamas fulfills the three conditions while 
preventing increased suffering of the Palestinian 
people resulting from the cessation of payments to a 
Hamas-led PLC.  Jogimaa repeated that neither the GOE 
nor the EU is deviating from the Quartet's demands 
towards the PLC.
