SUBJECT:  One Team One Mission One Network 
 
Why Kabul Needs One Unclassified Network 
======================================== 
¶1. USAID could deliver on its vitally important mission 
in Afghanistan more effectively if we had better means to 
coordinate policies and programs with the rest of the 
Mission, both Embassy Kabul agencies under COM authority, 
and DoD agencies under CDR CENTCOM and USFOR-A.  Current 
inefficiencies run counter to the President's plan for 
Afghanistan and Pakistan and are detrimental for the 
Collaborative Management Initiative.  In order to share 
information and provide an effective management platform, 
the AIDNET and OpenNet networks should be merged as soon 
as possible throughout Afghanistan.  OpenNet should 
remain the Mission's main business platform, and all of 
AID's business requirements should be met through OpenNet 
in order to achieve the critical goal of a single, 
effective, and comprehensive communication network to 
plan, assess, inform, and execute Mission policies and 
programs.  We need engineering assistance to ensure that 
an AIDNET to OpenNet migration will not disrupt USAID's 
critical mission. 
 
We Succeed Together 
=================== 
¶2. We are moving forward locally to make broader and 
better use of existing tools such as Intelink and uGov 
email but we need the Department's assistance on these 
issues to meet the President's objectives in Afghanistan; 
State and USAID need to be in lockstep on one network. 
We have discussed this initiative with USAID Afghanistan. 
We ask for Department (including USAID) leadership's 
active support both on resources and personnel to realize 
this goal.
