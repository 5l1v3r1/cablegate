SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST; TERRORIST ABDALLAH UNDER 
CONSIDERATION FOR RELEASE 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request.  See paragraph 2. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 27 we were contacted by, and 
subsequently received a letter to the Ambassador from Georges 
Kiejman who was legal counsel for the USG (as a civil party) 
during the prosecution of Georges Ibrahim Abdallah.  Abdullah 
was convicted in 1987 of the 1982 assassination of Embassy 
Paris U.S. Army Attach Charles Ray, and the attempted 
assassination of U.S. Consul General Robert Homme in a 
separate attack in 1984.  Kiejman forwarded a separate letter 
from the Paris Tribunal which indicates that Abdallah, who 
was convicted to life in prison, has requested conditional 
release.  The letter also states that the civil parties to 
the case, the U.S. Ambassador to Paris, Mrs. Sharon Ray, her 
children, and Robert Homme, may, if they wish, present their 
commentary to the court no later than March 9.  Embassy 
requests immediate guidance on how to proceed with an 
Ambassadorial response.  We also request that the Department 
contact Sharon Ray, her children, and Robert Homme, to inform 
them of their legal rights.  The Embassy's lawyer has agreed 
to handle transmission of all documents to the court. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶3. (U) Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, a member of the Lebanese 
Armed Revolutionary Faction (LARF), assassinated U.S. Embassy 
Paris Army Attache Charles Ray and Israeli diplomat Yacov 
Barsimantov in 1982.  In 1984, his group also attacked U.S. 
Consul General Strasbourg Robert Homme, though he survived 
his wounds.  Abdallah was apprehended by police in 1985, and 
convicted to life in prison on February 28, 1987.  At the 
time, the U.S. Ambassador to Paris was considered by the 
court as a civil party to the prosecution.  (Note: This is 
the first time the Embassy has been asked by the court for 
comments in connection with an application for release by 
Abdullah.  As far as the Embassy is aware, the Israeli 
government has not been allowed the same consideration, 
either in this case, or in others like it.) 
 
¶4. (U) Abdallah was refused release in 2004 and again 2005. 
In 2004 his request for release was granted by a regional 
court, before being refused by a higher court.  In 2005 his 
case was considered and refused by the Court on Application 
of Penal Sanctions of Tarbes.  He appealed the decision, but 
his appeal was rejected on January 31, 2006.  At that time, 
he was barred from requesting release again until February 1, 
¶2007.  He remains imprisoned at the Lannemezan Penitentiary. 
 
¶5. (U) In May 2006 the French judicial system centralized its 
processing of all parole hearings related to convicted 
terrorists.  The Paris Tribunal is now responsible for the 
decision in the first instance.  Appeals are handled by the 
Paris Court of Appeals. 
 
¶6. (U) Georges Kiejman judges in his letter to the Ambassador 
that, without the consideration of other factors, it is 
probable that Abdallah's release will be approved by the 
court and he will be expelled from French territory.  He adds 
that Abdallah's health and age will be taken into 
consideration by the Court.
