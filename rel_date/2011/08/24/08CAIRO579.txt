(SBU) In an apparent change from Egypt's previous position 
that it was "waiting and seeing" on whether to recognize 
Kosovo (reftels), it appears that the GOE now firmly opposes 
recognition.  According to local press March 24, Assistant 
Foreign Minister for European Affairs Fatima El Zahra told 
Egyptian parliamentarians that Egypt supports "independent 
rule" for Kosovo (read: autonomy within a greater Serbia) but 
not complete independence.  MFA Spokesman Hossam Zaki 
confirmed to A/DCM on March 24 unequivocally that Egypt will 
not recognize Kosovo.  "We have no plans to recognize 
Kosovo," he said, and "there is no change in our position."
