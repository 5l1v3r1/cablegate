REF: STATE 12108 -- PRESSURING IRAN ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff conveyed reftel demarche points to Mr. Jamal 
Sharifuddin Johan, Principal Assistant Secretary who covers 
human rights in the MFA's Multilateral Political Division, on 
February 10.  Jamal thanked Poloff for providing the U.S. 
perspective on Iran's human rights abuses, but noted that the 
GOM was finalizing its evaluation of Iran as part of the UN's 
Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process, and therefore it 
would be inappropriate for him to comment about Iran or the 
GOM's position on this issue at this time. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The GOM has a de facto policy of not 
criticizing the human rights record of other countries, 
except for Israel (which it sees as a 'regional issue'). With 
Iran in particular, the MFA has been consistently silent if 
the issue does not pertain to proliferation.  UPR 
considerations aside, it is unlikely that the MFA will 
provide us any additional information outside of possible 
public comments made at the UN.  End Comment.
