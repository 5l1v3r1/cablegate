Cisse, Director for International Affairs at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  Cisse said that Senegal has traditionally 
supported almost every U.S. candidate in various 
international fora.  He added that while they will study his 
candidacy our good bilateral relations means that "a priori" 
they would most likely support Mr. Carr to become a member of 
the standing committee of the International Red Cross and Red 
Crescent Movement.
