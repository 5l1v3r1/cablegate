Summary 
 
¶2. FM Gul enumerated Turkey's contribution to international 
peacekeeping and peace-building activities under UN, NATO, 
and EU missions, from the end of World War II up to Turkey's 
leadership role in the ISAF mission in Afghanistan.  He said 
Turkey has suffered the second highest casualty rate among 
contributors to UN peacekeeping missions.  Over 300 Turkish 
civilian police are currently deployed in UN peacekeeping 
missions around the world and Turkey strongly supports the 
establishment of a UN Peace Building Commission. 
 
¶3. Characterizing his country as one long plagued by 
terrorism, Gul stated Turkey is at the front of efforts to 
build international cooperation for the global war on 
terrorism and highlighted Turkey's commitment to the measures 
put in place under UNSCR 1373.  He noted Turkey's 
contributions to the UN Office for Drug Control and Crime 
Prevention  in Vienna.  He also pointed to Turkey's efforts 
within NATO, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation organization, and the Southeast European 
Cooperative Initiative in combating cross-border crime.  Gul 
also mentioned Turkey's commitment to non-proliferation, 
noting Turkey's participation in all major international 
non-proliferation instruments and export control regimes. 
 
¶4. Gul elaborated at some length on Turkey's emphasis on 
development issues and commitment to UN Millennium 
Development Goals.  He stated that Turkey's Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) for 2004 was USD 340 million. 
Turkey is a donor to the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Facility.  Occupying a disaster-prone geography, Turkey 
recognizes the importance of humanitarian aid.  It 
contributed over USD 232 million in cash and in-kind 
assistance to 25 countries in 2005.  In particular, Gul 
mentioned official and private Turkish support to victims of 
the 2004 Asian tsunami and 2005 Pakistan earthquake. 
 
¶5. Gul concluded his remarks by highlighting the role Turkey 
can play in fostering dialogue among cultures and 
contributing to mutual understanding among societies.  "We 
are committed to spreading universal values to a broader 
geography," he stated, noting Turkey's role in the 
establishment of the OIC-EU Joint Forum in 2002 and its 
co-sponsorship of the Alliance of Civilizations under the 
aegis of the UN Secretary General.
