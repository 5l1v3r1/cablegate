SUBJECT: FRANCE SUPPORTS MINUSTAH RENEWAL 
 
REF: STATE 127801 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU)  On September 17, poloff demarched Marianne 
Peron-Doise, acting MFA desk officer for the United Nations 
and International Organizations, concerning the UN 
Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH).  Peron-Doise 
agreed with U.S. points and said that France supports an 
extension of MINUSTAH.  Peron-Doise specifically noted the 
need to reinforce the police but not the military while 
maintaining current force levels.  France also understands 
the need to secure China's support for the renewal of 
MINUSTAH; however, Peron Doise noted it would be very 
difficult to convince China to back the renewal of MINUSTAH. 
France's financial support to Haiti is currently unclear.
