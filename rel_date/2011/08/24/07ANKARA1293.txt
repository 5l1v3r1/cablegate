¶1. We spoke with Roketsan General Director Huseyin Baysak and 
Roketsan Procurement Director Nevzat Caglayan May 25 
concerning the use of U.S. Munitions List infrared camera 
systems in Roketsan's infrared laboratory.  The Roketsan 
officials ensured us that Roketsan facilities are secured by 
electronic means and a guard force, and access is controlled 
by a badge system.  Foreign access to Roketsan facilities is 
restricted and must be approved by the Ministry of National 
Defense and other government agencies, and foreign visitors 
are escorted while on the premises.  The infrared lab itself, 
they explained, is not yet built.  They claimed that Roketsan 
meets Turkish government and NATO industrial security 
standards. 
 
¶2. The Roketsan officials gave us assurances that non-Turkish 
nationals will not have access to the U.S.-origin equipment. 
They also said that U.S. officials could conduct a physical 
inspection of the facilities with the permission of Turkish 
government authorities, and recommended we request such a 
visit at least a month in advance to ensure the necessary 
clearances are obtained. 
 
¶3. With regard to cooperation with China, Roketsan officials 
said they had recently concluded a joint project with an 
unnamed Chinese entity.  Presently, Roketsan obtains parts, 
components, and raw materials from China, which may 
necessitate occasional visits by Chinese technicians. 
 
¶4. The executives explained that Roketsan is closely 
associated with the government, with the Turkish Armed Forces 
Foundation controlling 55 percent of the company's shares. 
 
¶5. Based on the above information and Roketsan's reputation 
as a major defense firm tied to the Turkish government, we 
believe that Roketsan has the capability to provide adequate 
protections for subject equipment.
