¶1.  (U) In a coordinated effort led by Munich prosecutors, police 
from Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, and North Rhine Westphalia raided 
the apartments and workplaces of alleged supporters of the Turkish 
terrorist organization "Revolutionary People's Liberation Front" 
(DHKP/C) on November 28.  According to press reports, the raid 
resulted in 52 arrests, although only one suspect remains in police 
custody.  Police also confiscated approximately 40 computers, over 
200 computer discs and memory sticks, and several boxes containing 
propaganda material including journals and flyers.  The raids 
involved about 350 police, and included searches of 59 buildings in 
Bavaria (32), Baden-Wuerttemberg (21), and North Rhine Westphalia 
(6), Bavarian authorities announced.  Those questioned are suspected 
of having collected money and distributed propaganda material in 
support of the banned organization. 
¶2.  (SBU) Bavarian law enforcement officials told ConGen they 
consider the operation to have been a success.  The man in custody 
is a 44-year old Baden-Wuerttemberg resident who is suspected of 
being a national DHKP/C leader.  A Munich court issued an arrest 
warrant for him November 27 and he was arrested shortly thereafter 
in downtown Cologne.  Bavarian police officials also said they are 
closely investigating a 45 year old man and his 44 year old wife 
from the Augsburg area suspected of having led a local DHKP/C group. 
 Bavarian law enforcement officials estimate the DHKP-C has about 
800 members in Germany, of which 120 are in Bavaria. 
¶3.  (U) This report has been coordinated with Embassy Berlin and 
Consulates General Dusseldorf and Frankfurt.
