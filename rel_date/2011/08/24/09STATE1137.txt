REF: CAIRO 2585 
 
¶1. In response to reftel, Department confirms it has informed 
UNHCR on several occasions that the U.S. stands ready to 
consider for resettlement all referrals of any nationality, 
including Eritrean, from Egypt. 
 
¶2.  Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration/ Office of 
Refugee Admissions (PRM/A) Director Terry Rusch and Overseas 
Processing Section Chief Kelly Gauger met with UNHCR's 
Resettlement Service Chief Vincent Cochetel in Geneva in 
October on the margins of the Working Group on Resettlement 
(WGR).  They reiterated the U.S. willingness and capacity to 
consider any number of referrals from Egypt.  Cochetel 
informed all WGR attendees that a "Flash Appeal" requesting 
resettlement of Eritrean refugees in Egypt could be 
forthcoming, depending on UNHCR's access to the Eritreans in 
detention.  However, UNHCR/Washington informed PRM/A on 
December 31 that UNHCR still did not have access to many of 
the Eritreans in detention.  At PRM/A's request, 
UNHCR/Washington conveyed to UNHCR/Egypt Deputy Director 
Katharina Lumpp the continued interest of the U.S. in 
accepting referrals of those to whom UNHCR does have access. 
UNHCR/Washington noted that when UNHCR obtains access to the 
Eritreans, third-country resettlement is often sought on an 
expedited basis.  For this reason, UNHCR has turned to other 
resettlement countries, particularly Canada, given the length 
of time it normally takes for the U.S. to process individuals 
for refugee resettlement.  The Security Advisory Opinion 
(SAO) requirement for Eritreans makes it difficult, if not 
impossible, for the U.S. to process Eritreans in less than 
2-3 months' time, particularly given the current SAO backlog 
at one of the clearing agencies. 
 
¶3.  It is important to note that the U.S. cannot consider any 
case for refugee resettlement unless referred by UNHCR, a 
U.S. Mission, or an NGO that has received specific training 
from PRM and the Department of Homeland Security/ U.S. 
Citizenship and Immigration Services (DHS/USCIS).  The U.S. 
does not accept direct referrals for resettlement 
consideration from a foreign government.  Thus, although we 
stand ready to assist, there is very little we can do until 
UNHCR, the Embassy, or a qualified NGO is given access to and 
refers the Eritrean refugees in question.
