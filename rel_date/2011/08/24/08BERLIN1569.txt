SUBJECT: GERMAN RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON 
FINANCING FOR DEVELOPMENT - SHAPING THE OUTCOME 
IN DOHA 
 
REF: STATE 122053 
 
¶1. On November 20, Econoff met with Peter 
Silberberg, Head of Division, and Dr. Reinhard 
Hassenpflug, Deputy Head of Division, of the 
MFA's Economic and Development Affairs of the UN 
Division, to seek Germany's support for U.S. 
priorities with regard to the outcome of the 
Financing for Development (FfD) review process. 
Silberberg responded that Germany agrees with 
the need to affirm the basic principles of the 
Monterrey Consensus.  The 2002 Monterrey 
conference had been the beginning of a "global 
partnership for development," he said.  He also 
maintained that the Monterrey consensus entailed 
obligations for both developed and developing 
countries.  In particular, developing countries 
needed to address good governance issues, 
especially with regard to capital flight and tax 
exemptions; developed countries should assist 
them in doing so.  As for whether or not the 
Doha conference should be the final FfD review 
meeting, he said Germany and the EU were 
"probably more flexible" than the United States. 
Silberberg emphasized that Germany was in full 
accord with the EU Council Conclusions on FfD. 
 
¶2. Silberberg and Hassenpflug reported that the 
German delegation would be led by the Minister 
for Economic Cooperation and Development, 
Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, who is also the 
UNSYG's Special Envoy for Financing for 
Development.  Econoff provided the names of the 
U.S. head of delegation and alternate. 
 
¶3. Demarche points were also shared with 
contacts at the Federal Ministries of 
Development and Finance.
