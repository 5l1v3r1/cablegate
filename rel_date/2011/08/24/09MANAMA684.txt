REF: STATE 120272 
 
¶1. Summary: In response to reftel, the following is a description of 
current Arab League Boycott (ALB) practices in Bahrain. End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. As a member of the Arab League, Bahrain is officially committed 
to enforcement of the primary aspect of the Arab League's boycott of 
Israel, but enforcement is lax. Bahrain does not enforce the 
secondary or tertiary aspects of the boycott. The government has 
stated publicly that it recognizes the need to dismantle the primary 
aspect of the boycott and is taking steps to do so. In September 
2005, Bahrain closed its boycott office, and there are no other 
agencies or offices charged with boycott enforcement. The U.S. 
Government has received assurances from the government of Bahrain 
that it is committed to ending the boycott and the government has 
maintained that position despite occasional calls from some 
parliamentarians to increase boycott enforcement.  Bahrain has 
stated that it is fully committed to complying with WTO requirements 
on trade relations with other WTO members, and Bahrain has no 
restrictions on U.S. companies trading with Israel or doing business 
in Israel. 
 
¶3. Although in previous years U.S. citizens and firms occasionally 
encountered outdated tender documents that referenced secondary and 
tertiary aspects of the boycott, such language was quickly adjusted 
when brought to the attention of authorities. The government of 
Bahrain has made efforts to withdraw all old tender documents, and 
new articles were drafted and disseminated in harmony with WTO 
requirements. There were no reports from U.S. firms in 2009 of 
requests to comply with boycott requirements or provide information 
regarding compliance.
