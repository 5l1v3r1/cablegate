SUBJECT: HEAVY FIGHTING REPORTED IN NORTH DARFUR 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On September 6 and 7, multiple UNAMID, rebel, and 
civil society leaders separately contacted poloffs and reported 
intense fighting between rebel and GoS forces near Birmaza, North 
Darfur.  (Note:  According to UN maps, Birmaza is located 
approximately 50 kilometers north of Kutum with a latitude of 14 39' 
and a longitude of 24 35'.)  One rebel in the field claimed that the 
GoS force extensively bombed the area before an integrated 
SAF-janjaweed force stormed the area with over 120 vehicles and many 
more men riding horseback and camels.  UNDSS sources said early, 
unconfirmed reports indicate that the attack resulted in many 
civilian deaths, a large civilian displacement, and the destruction 
of Birmaza and Diza.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On September 7, UNDSS sources confirmed to poloff that 
the SAF, supported by janjaweed attacked SLA positions yesterday, 
allegedly destroying much of Birmaza and Diza and killing many 
civilians.  According to this source, the injured have not yet been 
evacuated, and fighting is ongoing.  UNDSS sources also said that 
there are unconfirmed rumors Justice and Equality Movement may be 
deploying from Chad to support a broad attack in coordination with 
other rebel movements (such rumors have ubiquitous for weeks 
though). 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  On September 6, at approximately 22:00 local time Senior 
Presidential Assistant and SLM Chairman Minni Minnawi sent a text 
message to poloff stating that SAF attacked and displaced many 
civilians in and around Birmaza.  El-Fasher resident and Fur 
activist, Abdullah Adam Bashar Adam also separately contacted poloff 
and stated that his Fur contacts informed him of a "wide military 
operation in North Darfur."  Like Minnawi Bashar stated that there 
was "mass displacement" resulting from these GoS attacks. (Note: 
Neither Minnawi nor Bashar have been available for recontact on 
September 7.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  On September 7, Bahar Idriss Abu Gharba of the United 
Resistance Front told poloff that SLA-Unity and URF had defeated the 
government and janjaweed forces who attacked Disa.  He added that at 
10:30 local time on September 7, the government attacked rebel 
positions and more fighting broke out in South Darfur east of Jebel 
Marra.  When queried why each of these areas had been targeted, Abu 
Gharba said he believes the government is launching a campaign 
against rebel positions throughout Darfur, and speculated that after 
the rainy season they would extend the campaign into Chad. Abu 
Gharba stated that he believes that the GoS is attempting to solve 
the problems in Darfur militarily in the wake of the ICC indictment 
of President Bashir. He could not answer definitively on the number 
of casualties. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Also on September 7, a statement attributed to URF and 
SLM/Unity appeared on the website sudaneseonline.com.  The statement 
claims that rebels repelled a joint janjaweed attack in Birmaza and 
Om Maraheek.  Unity and URF claimed in the statement that they 
destroyed 23 GoS armed vehicles (out of a total of 60) and killed 93 
camels and horses, along with capturing 12 SAF officers and 18 other 
soldiers. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Mustafa Ibrahim, an SLM field commander, also separately 
told poloff that the GoS bombing of the area around Birmaza was 
ongoing as of 12:00 noon on September 7.  Ibrahim stated that the 
GoS forces used over 120 vehicles in the attack.  According to 
Ibrahim, the Birmaza area is highly populated, filled with markets, 
and vital to the people.  "If the GoS controls this area, they 
control the people," noted Ibrahim.  Ibrahim claimed that janjaweed 
"taken from Kabkabiya" had been integrated into the GoS force for 
this attack.  Ibrahim downplayed reports of rebels capturing GoS 
soldiers, adding that most of the GoS forces had retreated following 
the strong rebel defense. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Also on September 7, URFF leader Alhadi Adam Agabeldour 
wrote poloffs.  (Note:  Contact provided unconventional spelling of 
his name and will be repeated as written.  End Note.)  According to 
Agabeldour, the Government of Sudan recently established a new 
militia  in Darfur which has now been employed in the reported 
attack on Birmaza.  Agabeldour stated that the leader of the militia 
is Major General Madani Badawi supported by other militia commanders 
including:  Mohamed Hamdan Dagalow (the Rizeigat Arab militia 
commander known as "Hamati), Mustafa Shareif Mousa, Omar Sabile, 
Alhadi Al mahadi  Ahamed, Al Nour Ahmed, Yousif Abdullah Hamad, 
Abdulrahim Mohamed Holi, Ibrahim Mousa Shareif.  Agabeldour also 
stated that some members of this militia were sent to a well-known 
GoS training facilities in Eastern Sudan, near Port Sudan. 
 
¶8. COMMENT:  Heavy fighting occurred on September 6 and 7, though 
the details of exactly which rebel groups, the motive for the 
 
KHARTOUM 00001366  002 OF 002 
 
 
attack, and the numbers and composition of dead and wounded all 
remain unclear.  Some analysts have noted that the area under 
question was presumably under SLM/Minnawi control.  Post will 
continue to contact SLM/MM representatives for more details and to 
discover whether there was any direct combat between SLM/MM 
commanders and SAF forces. While the regime has downplayed the 
fighting, some of the rebel claims - in terms of SAF casualties - 
also may be exaggerated. The most controversial, and least clear, 
element is the extent of civilian casualties.
