  ¶1.   Under headline "SADC commended for seeing light at 
      last" the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated its 
      October 8 editorial to welcoming the decision by the 
      Southern African Development Community (SADC) to block 
      Robert Mugabe from SADC chairmanship.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .The bigger political picture, ignoring the 
      arguments about whether Zimbabwe withdrew its claim 
      to the deputy chairmanship voluntarily, or was 
      kicked out on its ear, is that SADC has at last seen 
      the light.  Most people in Zimbabwe had given up on 
      SADC as an effective and active player in the 
      democratization stakes in the region. . .  This 
      latest decision by the group, whatever Mugabe's spin 
      doctors say of its origins, is to be commended. 
      SADC has at last seen the light."
