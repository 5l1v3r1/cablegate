SUBJECT: FRENCH RESPONSE TO BELARUS DRAFT RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 41971 
 
Poloffs delivered reftel demarche to Francois Vandeville, 
responsible for human rights in the MFA's United Nations and 
International Organizations bureau, and Pierre Cochard, 
DAS-equivalent for Russia and the former Soviet space, on 
March 10.  In a March 15 conversation, Vandeville 
characterized the draft text as "good" and "strong."  He said 
that Luxembourg, in its EU Presidency position, would 
consolidate all EU remarks, but noted that France would 
recommend adding colleges and universities to the list of 
entities against which harassment must cease in section 2(d). 
 France is also in favor of including a point against the 
arbitrary detention of political prisoners.  Finally, 
Vandeville questioned the first sentence in paragraph 4.  As 
the appointment of a Special Rapporteur was decided last 
year, the language, to his reading, seemed to indicate that 
the U.S. was requesting some type of change.  If this is not 
the case, he recommends substituting "extend the mandate" for 
"re-appoint."
