TALKS 
 
¶1.  Summary: Minister of Internal Affairs Ruhakana Rugunda described 
the discussions between Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) leader Joseph 
Kony and United Nations Special Envoy for LRA-Affected Areas Joaquim 
Chissano on March 11 as "positive and constructive."  Rugunda said 
that he anticipated another meeting between Kony, the GOU, and 
Government of South Sudan within two weeks to work through the LRA's 
concerns about the Juba venue.  Rugunda stated that the LRA did not 
demand a change in venue, but that its complaints about the 
mediation secretariat were technical and administrative in nature 
and could be remedied.  The date for the resumption of formal talks 
at Juba would be determined after the meeting in two weeks.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  The Government of Uganda's lead negotiator, Ruhakana Rugunda, 
was pleased with the meeting between United Nations Special Envoy 
for the LRA-Affected Areas Joaquim Chissano and LRA leaders on March 
¶11.  The meeting focused on the resumption of the talks.  The LRA 
delegation presented 18 demands, most focused on the Government of 
South Sudan (GOSS) mediation.  Rugunda and the other stakeholders 
present, including representatives of the Acholi Parliamentary 
Group, elected and appointed local officials from Acholiland, the 
Parliamentary opposition leader, and religious and traditional 
leaders were assured that the LRA would resume the negotiations. 
Chissano also brought with him a representative of the Government of 
Democratic Republic of Congo, Ambassador Kapanga, Mozambique's 
Minister for Presidential Affairs Francisco Madeira, and South 
African General Gilbert Romano, representing President Mbeki, to 
impress upon Kony the interest of other countries in the resolution 
of the conflict. 
 
¶3.  The LRA side was led by Kony, Vincent Otti, and fellow 
International Criminal Court-indictee Dominic Ongwen, and included 
other key military commanders, such as Ceasar Acellum, who had 
recently crossed the Nile River.  The LRA's Juba delegation also 
participated.  The LRA's demands focused on their security, 
accommodations, per diem, and treatment at Juba.  Gulu District 
Chairman Mao told us he was surprised that the LRA had only one 
demand that pertained to Uganda, the withdrawal of the Ugandan 
military from southern Sudan and replacement with 1,000 UN 
peacekeepers. 
 
¶4.  According to Rugunda, the LRA agreed to resume the talks after 
their concerns are hammered out at another preliminary meeting.  The 
talks would likely resume at Juba, as the GOSS mediation team is 
being beefed up with observers from Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, 
South Africa, and the DRC.  The LRA's other administrative concerns 
were focused on improving the Juba venue.  The GOU would respond to 
the LRA's demands after receiving them in writing.  In the meantime, 
Rugunda said he would maintain telephone contact with Kony and 
Otti. 
 
¶5.  Comment:  The GOU praised Chissano for his efforts to get the 
talks back on track, which included shuttle diplomacy between 
Khartoum, Juba, Garamba National Park, and Kampala.  The meeting was 
significant because it was the first time a minister of Rugunda's 
stature met face-to-face with Kony.  Those present said the 
highlight was a handshake between Rugunda and Kony.  Rugunda said 
the gesture reaffirmed his confidence that a peace deal could be 
attained.
