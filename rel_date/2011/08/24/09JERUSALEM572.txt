Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds leads with and the other two dailies front page a report 
from Israeli daily Haaretz revealing increased Israeli settlement 
activities in the West Bank.  The report indicates that settlers are 
taking advantage of the transitional period between Israeli 
governments to accelerate activities.  One "notable example" 
according to the report, is preparations being made to connect the 
Eli settlement north of Ramallah to the Yuval outpost. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with details of the March 24 
robbery of the Arab Bank in Al-Birah, near Ramallah in the West 
Bank.  Palestinian security services spokesperson Dmayri praised the 
work of Palestinian security in carefully investigating the robbery 
and turning up evidence that suggests that the attack was planned by 
an Israeli and executed by Palestinians with Jerusalem ID cards. 
Al-Hayyat Al-Jadidia also leads with news that its headquarters in 
Al-Birah was victim to arson on March 30, the fourth criminal fire 
in three months. 
 
Al-Quds' front page cites a Ma'an report when quoting Palestinian 
Authority Minister of Prisoners' Affairs Ajrami noting that the 
Israeli Government will deport six Palestinian prisoners from the 
southern Israeli Askelon detention center because they do not have 
Palestinian ID documents.  The Minister further revealed that no 
Arab or European country has shown a readiness to receive the 
prisoners. 
 
The three dailies report that prisoner exchange negotiations between 
Israel and Hamas are on hold.  Reports note that the issue will be 
dealt with by the new Israeli Government.  Al-Hayyat Al-Jadida also 
front pages an AFP report quoting Israeli President Shimon Peres 
addressing the EU and international community, confirming Israeli 
commitment to continuing the peace process with the Palestinians. 
 
All three dailies front page news that national Palestinian dialogue 
will resume in Cairo after the March 30,31 Arab summit in Doha. 
Al-Quds quotes Hamas leader Ismail Radwan announcing that agreement 
has been reached on a number of issues and that there is hope that 
remaining issues will be resolved in the new round of talks.  The 
report also quotes Mushir Al-Masri, Hamas leader in Gaza, 
highlighting that dialogue must be based on national (Palestinian) 
interests and not conditions imposed by the U.S. or the Middle East 
Quartet.  In related news, Al-Quds runs an inside page caricature 
about popular frustration with unity talks, showing Palestinian 
women urging Palestinian and Arab leaders to stop talking and take 
note of the situation on the ground, especially on the occasion of 
the 33rd anniversary of Palestinian "National Land Day" on March 30. 
Reporting follows on March 29 front page stories in all dailies 
announcing the passing of a draft resolution for the Doha Summit 
that, "reiterates support for Palestinian legitimacy," under 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas and the PLO, encourages 
Palestinian unity talks, and notes that the Arab Peace plan will 
expire in the future. 
 
On its front page, Al-Quds cites AP in reporting that 70,000 tons of 
explosives have entered Gaza since the end of the recent conflict 
with Israel.  The report cites Israeli concerns that their military 
operation should have continued for a longer time in order to deny 
Hamas the ability to rearm. 
 
Al-Quds' inside page cites an exclusive interview with chief PLO 
negotiator Saeb Erekat explaining that  Palestinian Authority 
 
JERUSALEM 00000572  002 OF 003 
 
 
President Abbas has conveyed to the U.S., EU, Russia and the U.N 
that the Palestinian Authority Government remains commitment to 
signed PLO agreements.  Erekat's comments responded to March 27 
statements by Hamas leader Al Bardawil that Hamas will not, "abide 
by PLO agreements and... not go beyond the Mecca Agreement."  Erekat 
added that negotiations will not continue with the new Israeli 
Government unless it respects previous, signed agreements.

WEEKEND STORIES: 
-------------- 
Sunday, March 29 
Al Quds' front page headlined news that Israeli settlement groups 
plan to "seize" 70 properties in the Al Yaman neighborhood of Silwan 
in East Jerusalem.  The paper quotes, Hatim Abdil Qadir, advisor to 
the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister on Jerusalem Affairs, 
revealing a "big scam" by settler groups to accomplish the gradual 
transfer of ownership using falsified Ottoman documents.  Qadir 
stressed that he will file appeals in Israeli court to protect each 
property. 
 
All front pages headlined, "Senior American delegation visits the 
Palestinian Territories and warns Israel against settlement 
expansion in Ma'ale Adumim [E1] area." Reporting on March 28 
statements by chief PLO negotiator Saeb Erekat, the papers note that 
Erekat added, "the new American administration is working 
intensively against the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, 
particularly in the vicinity and surroundings of occupied 
Jerusalem..."  The story followed on a March 28 article in Al Ayyam 
which included comments by U.S. Consulate General Jerusalem 
spokesperson Schweitzer-Bluhm explaining that the March 27 visit, 
"falls within the framework of our ongoing efforts to monitor 
activities in the area."  The same article reported that Special 
Envoy George Mitchell will explore settlement issues in more detail 
on future visits. 
 
Saturday, March 28, 2009 
All front pages headlined that, "Europe links improvement of its 
relations with Israel to commitment to the two-state solution," 
running comments by Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs and President 
of the EU Council of Ministers Schwarzenberg.  On a different topic, 
Al Quds' and Al Ayyam's front pages report that Egypt has sent its 
number two intelligence official to Damascus to, "continue 
discussions with Syrian officials regarding Arab reconciliation and 
Syrian engagement in Palestinian reconciliation efforts."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1)  Sa'id Mihayu opines about U.S. policy towards Iran in Al Quds 
independent daily under the title, "Ready to Change" (03/30): 
"...according to Khomeini nothing in U.S. policy has changed and the 
Iranian Government will not be fooled that easily... While President 
Obama cannot change the history of the Middle East [and impact of 
prior U.S. policies]... it is useful to remember that the longest 
journey begins with the first step [Obama's Nowruz message] which, 
no matter how small, can contribute to improving U.S.-Islamic 
relations and ultimately change the attitudes of Arab and Islamic 
countries and make [Islamic leaders] more open to dialogue with 
other civilizations." 
 
2)  Muafiq Mattar opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadidia under the title " A 
lesson learned" (03/30):  "I wonder if Hamas will now start to 
seriously think about putting Palestinian interests first, and give 
 
JERUSALEM 00000572  003 OF 003 
 
 
second priority to its ties to Iran and other regional groups... 
[Hamas leader Misha'al's statement that] the World needs Hamas to 
end the Arab- Israeli conflict indicates that Hamas now realizes 
that the international community will not allow terror to redraw 
international and regional borders.  This reality will not change 
even with if Hamas strengthens its ties to Iran.  The statement made 
by the Qatari Foreign Minister [not to invite Hamas or Iran to the 
Doha summit] shows that Qatar has learned its lesson... national 
interests must come first."
