Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA).

      - June 1 fighting in North Darfur

--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Minawi, AbdelWahid, Kiir meeting set for June 2 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The meeting between First Vice President Salva Kiir, 
SLA Minni Minawi and AbdelWahid is scheduled for June 2 in 
Yei, South Sudan.  On June 1, Minawi is scheduled to travel 
from North Darfur to Yei via the African Union with Special 
Representative Roger Winter and Brian D'Silva.  On June 2, 
Kiir from Khartoum and AbdelWahid from Nairobi are expected 
to travel to Yei. Kiir will meet with Minawi first then both 
will meet with AbdelWahid with no international parties 
participating.  Kiir will be accompanied by Yassir Arman and 
Pagan Amum while Minawi and AbdelWahid will be accompanied by 
a small delegation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On May 31, Winter, D'Silva, and USAID Mission 
Director Almquist met with the ICRC in North Darfur to 
discuss the possibilities of further treatment for the 
SLA/Minawi war wounded. Minawi has requested medical 
assistance for 300 wounded combatants, probably in terms of 
orthopedic assistance.  Winter will seek further 
clarification on the type of medical assistance requested and 
Almquist will discuss with the ICRC in Khartoum. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) As requested, Winter has alerted Kiir and Minawi to 
forthcoming invitations to visit Washington.  Both responded 
positively and look forward to receiving formal invitations. 
Neither gave specific feedback on proposed dates for the 
respective visits. 
 
--------------------- 
North Darfur Fighting 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) There was reported fighting in the North Darfur towns 
of Tarama, Tabit and Khoudiat. The African Union is 
organizing a road evacuation to El Fasher for the wounded 
people.  There is no further information on causalities. 
 
------------------------------ 
NRC to return to South Darfur 
------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (U) On May 30, the government of South Darfur and the 
Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) signed a new contract for NRC 
to resume its activities in South Darfur including managing 
Kalma Camp and food distributions to 50,000 IDP's. NRC 
expects full operations to resume within the next two weeks. 
Norway's DCM told us that, during negotiations, it was clear 
there was a new attitude on the part of the government; the 
Wali had been instructed to facilitate NGO activities.  The 
contract includes protection and is, notably, for one year. 
 
------------------------------ 
Musa Hilal visits El Geneina 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) On May 30, Musa Hilal, top Arab militia leader in 
Darfur, visited El Geneina and met with state government 
officials.  Hilal reportedly vented his feelings of betrayal 
by the GNU for signing DPA and deplored the GNU's rejection 
of Arab militias; however, he added that the militias were 
tired of fighting and that he would urge his supporters to 
stop their attacks in Darfur.  Hilal claimed that the men 
under his command have been instructed to patrol Fur tribal 
areas to provide protection to the population remaining in 
those areas.  He said that he planned to tour Darfur to work 
on reconciliation among the various ethnic groups and will 
conduct public information campaigns targeting Arab groups to 
promote peace. Hilal has reportedly spread the message to 
some of his followers not to harm international aid agencies. 
 
--------------------------- 
Student Riots against DPA 
--------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) On May 30, a small group of students supporting 
AbdelWahid at the University of Al-Azhari protested against 
the DPA, torching a lecturer's vehicle and attacking the 
 
KHARTOUM 00001291  002 OF 002 
 
 
library.  Fifteen students were arrested.
