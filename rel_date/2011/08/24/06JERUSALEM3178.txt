MILITARY OPERATIONS 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) A senior American officer assigned to the UN Truce 
Supervision Organization (UNTSO) headquarters in Jerusalem 
reported that both American citizens assigned to UNTSO are 
accounted for after the bombing of the UNTSO position at 
al-Khayam in southern Lebanon, July 25. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) At least 13 Palestinians have been killed, 
including three PIJ activists, a Hamas military wing member, 
and a 7-year old child, during a still ongoing IDF incursion, 
as of 1500 local July 26, into the Shijaya neighborhood of 
Gaza City, a heavily crowded Hamas stronghold.  Israeli 
forces, with at least 20 APCs, are engaged there in heavy 
fighting.  At least 42 Palestinians have been injured, 11 
critically.  In the Khan Younis governorate, a 14-year old 
was killed in Abbasan village.  There were IDF air strikes 
against houses in Rafah and Gaza City, both of which were 
allegedly used to store weapons for the Hamas military wing; 
no casualties or injuries. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) IDF arrest operations continued in the West Bank. 
A senior al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade member Ibrahim al-Hindi was 
arrested in Ramallah.  During the military operation in 
Ramallah, the IDF raided the military intelligence 
headquarters and the office of the Palestinian Broadcasting 
Corporation.  At least three were lightly wounded by IDF 
gunfire. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) At least nine Qassam rockets were fired July 26, as 
of 1500 local.  Three were fired towards Ashkelon and the 
western Negev, and six just north of the Erez crossing.  No 
injuries or damage were reported by the Israeli media.  The 
Iz al-Din Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, 
claimed responsibility for three of the rockets fired north 
of Erez.  The PFLP military wing claimed responsibility for 
one of the three rockets fired July 25. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) PA security forces scuffled July 25 with nearly 700 
Palestinian protesters, carrying flags of militant groups 
such as Hamas, PIJ, Hizballah, who tried to approach the 
Presidential compound, Muqata, in Ramallah, while Secretary 
Rice met with President Abbas.  The PA security forces 
stopped the protesters one kilometer from the compound.

HUMANITARIAN SITUATION 
---------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The Rafah passenger crossing is closed July 25. 
The Karni/al-Mintar crossing is closed on July 26, according 
to USAID Gaza-based staff.  It was open July 25 and 213 
truckloads entered Gaza.  The Nahal Oz fuel transfer station 
is operational on July 26. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) All ten electricity feeder lines from Israel into 
Gaza are operational July 26.  Municipal employees in Rafah 
and Gaza City began striking July 26 due to non-payment of 
salaries in four months, so solid waste is piling up.
