¶1.  SUMMARY:  With the start of the Hajj pilgrimage quickly 
approaching, Indonesia--the world's largest Muslim country by 
population--is making massive preparations for the annual 
pilgrimage to Mecca.  Indonesia is the largest contributor to 
the Hajj, sending over 200,000 pilgrims.  Amid the regular 
chorus of complaints re corruption in the process, the 
Ministry of Religious Affairs is coordinating Hajj planning 
for Indonesia.  The Indonesian and Saudi governments are 
working together regarding concerns about H1N1.  END SUMMARY. 
 
INDONESIA READIES FOR THE HAJJ 
 
¶2.  The annual Hajj season has begun and the first groups of 
Indonesian pilgrims are departing for Saudi Arabia.  As the 
world's most populous Muslim country with over 200 million 
adherents of Islam, Indonesia will send over 200,000 pilgrims 
to participate in the annual Hajj, more than any other nation 
(except for host Saudi Arabia).  Making the Hajj--which 
begins in two weeks--is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for 
many Indonesians and an obligation as the fifth pillar of 
Islam.  Beginning from October 23, governors and other 
officials from across the country have been in the press 
saluting pilgrims in ceremonies at airports.  To handle the 
increase in passengers, Garuda Airlines has leased several 
wide-bodied jets from French company Corsairfly. 
 
GOI COORDINATES EFFORT 
 
¶3.  The Ministry of Religious Affairs is responsible for 
coordinating the massive undertaking to prepare Indonesian 
pilgrims for the 2009 Hajj.  The Indonesian government 
arranges all Hajj packages.  These packages include 
transportation, accommodations, food, visa approvals, and 
health services for all pilgrims. 
 
¶4.  A recent survey by Indonesian anti-corruption groups 
alleges that the annual pilgrimage is mired in corruption. 
Indonesian Corruption Watch (ICW) recently cited reports of 
widespread corruption in the handling of the Hajj packages. 
ICW alleged that officials in the Ministry of Religious 
Affairs inflated the cost of the Hajj packages and pocketed 
the profit.  Many Indonesians have returned in the past 
complaining of shoddy housing and poor food quality. 
Anti-corruption activists allege that GOI officials have a 
long history of soliciting bribes for things like marriage 
and divorce certificates, as well as other required Hajj 
documents. 
 
¶5.  Ministry officials say they are currently working closely 
with the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) to ensure 
that all Hajj fees are legal and transparent.  The GOI 
intends to send members of the Indonesian Parliament (DPR) 
and other government officials to Mecca in order to ensure 
all Hajj preparations are adequate. 
 
H1N1 CONCERNS 
 
¶6.  H1N1 is a concern this year.  Indonesian and Saudi 
officials are requiring all prospective Indonesians Hajj 
pilgrims to receive vaccinations against H1N1 and meningitis 
in order to obtain a Hajj visa.  Controversy arose previously 
over the meningitis vaccine with allegations that it 
contained a pork enzyme, which prompted the Indonesian 
Council Of Ulemas (MUI) to issue a controversial fatwah 
declaring the vaccine "haram" or forbidden.  Despite the 
fatwah, GOI officials are reportedly administering the 
vaccinations without any problems. 
 
TRYING TO AVOID SLIP-UPS 
 
¶7.  As the Hajj approaches, the GOI--aware of the political 
backlash that could result from slip-ups--has been very 
pro-active in trying to ensure a pleasant experience for 
Indonesian pilgrims.  It has also assured Indonesians that it 
is taking steps against corruption.  That said, preparing for 
the Hajj is a truly large-scale effort and government 
capabilities are clearly stretched to the limit.
