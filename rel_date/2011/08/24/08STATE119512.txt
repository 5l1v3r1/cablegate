that visa applications for the individual be filed with as 
much time as possible to allow for additional processing 
procedures that may be required.  Note that if, at any 
time, the Embassy becomes aware of any information regarding 
incidents which could be deemed to be credible information 
of a gross violation of human rights by this 
individual, the Embassy should so inform the Department.
