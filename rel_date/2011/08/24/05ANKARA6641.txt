¶1. This is an action request.  Please see paragraphs 2 
& 3. 
 
¶2. Turkey has proposed January 23 through 24, 2006, for 
the next Trade and Investment Framework (TIFA) Council 
meeting with the US.  Foreign Trade Undersecretariat 
(FTU) U/S Tuncer Kayalar will lead the Turkish 
delegation.  Embassy would appreciate USTR's 
confirmation of AUSTR Shaun Donnelly's and the US 
delegation's availability for these dates. 
 
¶3. FTU officials have proposed that the TIFA meeting be 
organized so that Kayalar and Donnelly open and close 
the meeting while working groups (without the 
delegation heads' participation) discuss specific 
issues during the day.  Post requests USTR's response 
to this proposal. FTU has also requested USTR's 
feedback regarding their proposed agenda (ref A), which 
includes discussions on overall trade policy, 
agriculture (including rice), generalized system of 
preferences (GSPs), investment issues, intellectual 
property rights, regional cooperation issues, qualified 
industrial zones (QIZs), anti-dumping and anti-subsidy 
implementation, the Container Security Initiative 
(CSI), and energy cooperation.  According to the FTU 
officials, they hope to finalize the agenda as soon as 
possible so that they can begin scheduling appropriate 
officials from other ministries and agencies.  We would 
also appreciate USTR's assistance in finalizing the 
agenda. 
 
¶4. Post has proposed a business-related event on the 
margins of the TIFA that would bring Turkish and 
American companies together with government officials. 
We envision a reception the evening before the TIFA, 
schedules permitting, and also possibly a meeting 
between the private sector and the delegations prior to 
the opening of the TIFA.  In order to facilitate this 
public-private dialogue, FTU has proposed two days for 
the TIFA, one for the meeting and one for other events.
