On November 4, Poloff delivered reftel points to the 
U.S. Desk Officer for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Government of Seychelles.  The Government of Seychelles 
offered no substantive response at the time; however, the 
Desk Officer stated that the U.S. concerns would be forwarded 
to the Seychelles mission in New York.  Per the GOS Desk 
Officer, the Seychelles UN Representative is currently in 
Spain for climate change talks and will not be in the U.S. 
for the discussion.
