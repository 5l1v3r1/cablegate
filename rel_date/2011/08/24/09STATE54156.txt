SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050169035 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050169035 for the export of 
ammunition to Russia.  Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request:  The Bureau of Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Labor (DRL) has previously had concerns with the 
export of large quantities of ammunition to Russia.  This 
license is for 24,000 reloading bullets to an individual. 
This request is to confirm the end-use and to confirm the 
necessity for this large quantity. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of this transaction by making appropriate inquiries to 
end-user, Vasiliy Volovod.  The following points are included 
for guidance: 
 
(To Vasiliy Volovod) 
 
--Can you confirm the order of the reloading bullets listed 
on this license?  How many bullets do you use during the 
course of a typical month?  What are these bullets going to 
be used for?  Can you explain why you need such a significant 
quantity? 
 
--Have you ordered ammunition components (e.g. bullets, 
brass) from the United States in the past?  If so, what items 
and in what quantity?  What were those items used for and by 
whom?  Can you explain any significant increases in quantity 
of ammunition components purchased from the United States? 
 
--Are you in the business of selling defense articles or 
services?  If so, what goods and services do you provide? 
Who are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
