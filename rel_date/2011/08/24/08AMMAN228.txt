¶1.  (U) Jordan and Syria signed 12 agreements designed to strengthen 
bilateral relations following up on the 12th session of the Joint 
Jordanian-Syrian Higher Committee which concluded December 31.  The 
agreements address economic integration, trade, agriculture, water, 
health, industry, transportation, services and labor issues, sports, 
culture, youth, and the media.  Jordanian Prime Minister Nader 
al-Dahabi and his Syrian counterpart Mohammad Naji Utri lauded the 
agreements and emphasized that each country would strive for 
immediate implementation.  To that end, they agreed to establish a 
joint businessmen's council between their respective Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry, and proposed timetables for some activities: 
cooperation in housing and construction in 2008 and 2009; work on a 
cultural and scientific cooperation agreement for the period 
2008-2010; conclusion of an agreement on social affairs, labor 
regulation, and vocational training by 2009; and an agreement on 
sanitation and drinking water for 2008-2009. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Previous meetings of the bilateral joint committee have 
produced agreements as well as other initiatives addressing trade 
and water-sharing.  Those compacts, however, have been largely 
symbolic and promised Syrian wheat has not materialized, in part due 
to a poor growing season and also to Syria overextending itself in 
terms of wheat export commitments (ref C).  Likewise, Syria has not 
met its commitments to contribute to filling the Al-Wahdah (Unity) 
Dam.  During talks the week of January 14 between USAID and the 
Jordan Valley Authority (JVA), the JVA Secretary General lamented 
that the Yarmouk River flow from Syria into the Wahdah dam continues 
to decline.  Over the past year since the dam first became 
operational, only approximately 10% of its 110 million cubic meter 
capacity has been achieved.  Water Minister Raed Abu Soud sounded 
cautiously optimistic over what he characterizes as an improved 
climate for cooperation, however, noting to USAID that Syria also 
has many competing demands on water resources and that his ministry 
will carefully monitor the amount of water flowing from the north in 
coming months. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT: Despite concerns about water, the results of this 
latest round of bilateral Syrian-Jordanian talks appear to be more 
substantive and more focused on Jordanian priorities than previous 
iterations, perhaps an outcome of recent, increased Jordanian 
interaction with Syria.  Skeptics, however, say success can only be 
measured when Syria and Jordan streamline border crossing procedures 
between the two countries, about which talks are underway.  END 
COMMENT.
