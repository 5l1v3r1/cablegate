Â¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel points to MFA International 
Organizations Department's Human Rights and Humanitarian 
Division Chief Tigran Samvelian.  Samvelian said the GOAM's 
position on the change to the statutes of the International 
Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is "very much in line" 
with the U.S. position.  He pointed out that Armenia voted to 
adopt the Third Additional Protocol in December and said that 
Armenia would not support the adjournment or other disruption 
of the June 20-21 meeting.  Samvelian said Armenia would 
definitely be represented by a member of its Permanent 
Mission to the United Nations and Other International 
Organizations in Geneva.  He said funding constraints made it 
unlikely that a government representative from Yerevan would 
attend.  Samvelian said the GOAM had inquired with the 
International Committee of the Red Cross regarding funding, 
but was told none would be available.  He said that, should 
funding become available, the GOAM would consider sending a 
representative from the MFA.
