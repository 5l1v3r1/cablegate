SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (09/24): Palestinian press focus 
on President Obama's UNGA speech 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
President Obama's first speech at the UN General Assembly in New 
York on September 23 receives prominent coverage in the local press. 
The dailies highlight Obama's statements in which he called the 
continued settlement activities n the West Bank "illegal." Obama 
noted that the time has come to pursue unconditional final status 
negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis, including the 
issues of refugees, security, borders and Jerusalem. Additionally, 
Obama called on the Arab states to stop incitement against Israel in 
order to pave the way for successful peace talks. Obama reiterated 
his support for the two-state solution and noted that "progress" was 
made during the trilateral meeting held September 22. 
 
Al-Quds runs separate front page coverage commenting on the outcome 
of the trilateral meeting and Obama's speech. Coverage noted that 
this was a victory for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as 
Obama reversed his demand for a freeze in settlement activity to 
help push the negotiations forward. Reports concluded that Obama's 
tone changed after the trilateral meeting and became more flexible 
regarding the continuation of settlement activity. Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida quotes Netanyahu saying that he welcomes Obama's speech 
and his call for the resumption of negotiations without 
preconditions, and his unshakeable support to the people of Israel. 
 
Senator Mitchell's statement after the trilateral meeting in New 
York is highlighted in the dailies. Citing AFP, Al-Quds' front page 
quotes Mitchell saying that the US is aware of the existing gaps 
between the Palestinian and Israeli positions and noted that both 
parties are eager to restart the peace talks as soon as possible. 
 
The dailies highlight the Palestinian Authority (PA) reactions and 
comments on the trilateral meeting and Obama's speech. Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida notes that the PA is satisfied with President Obama's 
speech before the UN General Assembly. Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat 
is quoted saying that "we appreciate Obama's remarks concerning the 
illegality of settlement activity and his call to end the occupation 
that started in 1967." 
 
The Secretary General of the Palestinian Liberation Organization 
Executive Committee Yaser Abed Rabbo also welcomed President Obama's 
speech and noted to Al-Quds that the speech weakened Israeli claims 
that the trilateral meeting was a victory for Israel. On the 
contrary, Abed Rabbo noted that Obama was the first President who 
spoke so explicitly about ending the occupation and resuming 
negotiations. 
 
Citing DPA and Israeli official sources, Al-Quds front pages news 
that Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman expressed his 
satisfaction with the outcomes of the trilateral meeting, as it 
proved that the Israeli government can resume negotiations without 
preconditions and compromises, according to coverage. 
 
In separate coverage, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida notes that PA President 
Mahmoud Abbas briefed the Arab Foreign Ministers on the outcome of 
his talks with Obama and Netanyahu. He reiterated that the Israelis 
have to meet all of their road map obligations, primarily the 
cessation of settlement activity, including natural growth. Al-Ayyam 
reports on the PA President's Spokesperson Nabil Abu Rundeinah 
 
JERUSALEM 00001717  002 OF 002 
 
 
noting that the meetings with the Israelis do not necessarily mean 
the resumption of negotiations. He is quoted in Al-Ayyam saying "Our 
position prior to the meeting is the same after the meeting" and 
reiterated that without the cessation of settlement activity, there 
will be no negotiations. Abu Rudeinah urged the US to exert more 
pressure on Israel to meet its road map obligations. 
 
In citing the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot, the dailies report that 
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak recently endorsed the 
establishment of 37 settlement units in Karni Shamron settlement in 
the northern West Bank.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Fathi Al-Biss opines in an editorial in Al-Ayyam independent 
daily under the title "A disappointment" (09/24): "President Abbas' 
decision to meet Netanyahu was disappointing and implies that the 
Palestinian will be willing to make even more compromises ... the 
disappointment may vanish if President Abbas and the PLO explain the 
reasons behind this meeting and to assure us there are hidden 
details that would benefit the Palestinians." 
 
2) Yahia Rabah opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily under the 
title "Israel comes first" (09/24):"Why is the Israeli government so 
stubborn and confident about the settlement issue? Everyone knows 
that the US can pressure Israel ... however, the Israelis also know 
that the US is aware of Israel's strength in the Middle East, which 
is the first priority."
