REFTELS: REQUEST FORM #04210017; DATED 6/04/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, AKNIIPO ANO, Moscow, 
Russia. The company is listed on BIS license applications: NLR as 
the ultimate consignee of forty eight electronic integrated circuits 
and micro assemblies, digital field programmable gate arrays, 
product no:APA450-PQ2081. These items are controlled for national 
security, missile technology, nuclear non-proliferation and 
anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 3A001. The licensee is Actel 
Corporation, 2061 Stierlin CT, Mountain View, CA. 
 
¶3. On July 29, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of AKNIIPO ANO (Aerospace Scientific and 
Research Test Industrial Company, Automated Non-Commercial 
Organization), 5, Aviatsionny Pereulok, Moscow, Russia. The export 
control team met with Dmitry Kholomkin, General Director and Pavel 
Turikin, Department Head. 
 
¶4. AKNIIPO ANO was created in 2001, when three companies, 
Rocket-Space Corporation Energy, Holding Company Aviapribor and 
Russian Scientific Research Institute Electrostandart, joined 
together.  It has 60 full time employees and approximately 300 under 
various contracts for special projects. 
 
¶5. AKNIIPO ANO is licensed by the Russian government to produce and 
develop various finished components for space exploration projects. 
 
¶6. The commodities in reftel were purchased by AKNIIPO ANO for use 
in a joint space exploration project with NASA involving the 
Fobos-Grunt mission.  The missionQs objectives are to collect soil 
samples from Fobos, a moon of mars and to bring the samples back to 
Earth for comprehensive scientific research into Fobos, Mars and 
Martian space. 
 
¶7. The commodities in reftel were not located in the consigneeQs 
facility because they have already been placed onboard the Russian 
launch vehicle that is scheduled for an October launch. The 
commodities do appear to be being used for the end use for which 
they were licensed. There were no indications of impropriety and the 
consigneeQs answers were not evasive. 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends AKNIIPO ANO, Moscow, Russia, as 
a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
