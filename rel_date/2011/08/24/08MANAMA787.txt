(SBU) A/DCM delivered reftel points to MFA Bilateral 
Relations Director Dr. Dhafer Al Umran on November 25.  Al 
Umran noted that it would likely be difficult for the Foreign 
Minister to attend, given his commitments for National Day 
celebrations on December 16.  He suggested that Bahrain's UN 
ambassador could represent the kingdom at the conference.
