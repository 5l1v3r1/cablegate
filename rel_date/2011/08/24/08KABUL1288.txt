SUBJECT: UNITED FRONT ON POLITICAL DECENTRALIZATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) United Front Spokesman Hussain Sangcharaki recently 
elaborated on his political bloc's hope of transitioning to a 
parliamentary system if it wins the 2009 presidential 
election.  While acknowledging Afghanistan's democratic 
achievements since the Taliban's ouster, Sangcharaki argued 
the current presidential system too easily allows a single 
ethnic group to dominate the country.  Karzai, he claimed, 
has systematically used the presidency to favor Pashtuns. 
Sangcharaki emphasized he did not blame the president 
personally for this.  He said Afghanistan's security 
uncertainties, governmental tradition and culture would 
predispose any leader towards husbanding power primarily 
among members of his own ethnic group. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sangcharaki contends a parliamentary system and 
elected provincial governors, district administrators and 
mayors would counter this predisposition and forestall 
resentment among non-Pashtun ethnic groups by offering them 
more political opportunities than the winner-takes-all 2004 
Constitution.  He disagreed with the contention that a more 
decentralized system would encourage provincial fiefdoms.  He 
asserted an empowered parliament would give ethnic groups 
more influence in central government decision-making, 
reinforcing provincial and local leaders' connection to the 
capital.  Sangcharaki promised the United Front would 
encourage that orientation by maintaining budgetary control 
in Kabul, though residing in an empowered National Assembly 
rather than with the president. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Sangcharaki, the United Front would 
follow a 2009 presidential win immediately with a Loya Jirga 
"to amend" the constitution.  Prominent among likely 
amendments would be the transfer of executive authority to a 
new office of the prime minister from the presidency, which 
would be relegated to a largely ceremonial role.  The Prime 
Minister would appoint his cabinet subject to lower house 
review and approval. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Neither Sangcharaki nor other United Front leaders 
appear to have gamed out fully the possible consequences of 
their radical decentralization ambitions.  Sangcharaki was 
stymied by our inquiry as to how the United Front proposes to 
restrict the focus of a constitutional Loya Jirga.  In 
theory, once convened, a Loya Jirga could become a tool of 
the more numerous Pashtun, who may be inclined to restore the 
hegemony they had enjoyed for more than two centuries.
