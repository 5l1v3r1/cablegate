INITIATIVE PROPOSAL FOR A NUCLEAR FUEL BANK - SPANISH REPLY 
 
REF: SECSTATE 68313 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On July 1, Poloff conveyed reftel demarche to 
Ignacio Sanchez, MFA Deputy Director General for 
Nonproliferation, and asked the Spanish government to 
consider pledging funds to support the NTI's proposal for the 
creation of a nuclear fuel bank.  Sanchez replied on July 4 
that while Spain favors the creation of a nuclear fuel bank, 
they would prefer to work through the IAEA.  He explained 
that if and when it comes to providing additional funds for 
the nuclear fuel bank, Spain would prefer to contribute to 
IAEA coffers vice directly to the NTI.  Sanchez added that 
for Spain it is a question of "ownership" and who has the 
lead on the project.
