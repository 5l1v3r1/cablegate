¶1.  (SBU) Summary: The impact from the largest recorded counterfeit 
pharmaceutical raid in the world that took place in Jakarta on July 
23 is still reverberating within the Government of Indonesia (GOI). 
The pharmaceutical industry is reacting positively and proactively 
with pledged assistance, a media event, a public destruction 
ceremony and a chemical analysis of the seized drugs.  The 
Indonesian National Police advise that more operations will be 
forthcoming. End Summary. 
 
Pharmaceutical Industry Takes Notice 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Subsequent to the largest recorded counterfeit 
pharmaceutical raid in the world two weeks ago (reftel B), the 
International Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Group (IPMG) and 
pharmaceutical security representatives visited Jakarta to meet with 
the Indonesian National Police (INP) and State 
Department/INL-funded, Department of Justice (DOJ) International 
Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) to 
praise the success and discuss future collaboration and assistance. 
Companies represented include Pfizer, Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, and 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).  On September 3, the IPMG will stage a media 
event to present the Police Chief for Metro Jakarta with an award. 
 
 
Testing the Seized Goods 
------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ICITAP facilitated an agreement between the INP and the 
pharmaceutical industry to conduct a chemical analysis of a large 
sample of the seized drugs for media publication.  This is a 
temporary measure until the ICITAP Forensic Project can develop INP 
forensic laboratory capabilities that will allow INP to conduct its 
own chemical analysis in future. 
 
Media Event 
----------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On September 7, the INP, in collaboration with the 
pharmaceutical industry, will stage a joint-public destruction 
ceremony of the seized pharmaceuticals.  The police are concerned if 
not disposed of in a timely manner, the seized drugs could find 
their way back into the market. Police requested guidance from the 
Prosecutor's office on how to destroy the evidence without adversely 
affecting the criminal process. 
 
More to Come? 
------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The INP is continuing its investigative efforts into other 
illicit counterfeit drug operations that have been discovered as a 
result of these earlier raids. Police advise that additional 
seizures will likely result in the near future.
