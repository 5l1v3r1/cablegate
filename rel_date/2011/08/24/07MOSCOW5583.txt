SUBJECT: PUTIN MAKES TELEVISED APPEAL TO VOTERS 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In a November 29 televised appeal, Putin 
asked voters to support the party whose ticket he leads, 
United Russia, in Sunday's Duma elections.  The brief 
address, notable for its lack of surprise, was a classic 
appeal by an incumbent politician to stay the course. 
Immediately following Putin's address, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), an 
"opposition party" that supports the Kremlin, also appealed 
to voters for support.  His appearance, following Putin's, 
may have been a sign that the Kremlin is trying to give LDPR 
a boost to ensure they remain in the Duma.  End summary. 
 
Putin Asks Voters to Stay the Course 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) In a five-minute address aired at noon on November 29 
on national television, Putin directly appealed to voters to 
vote United Russia on December 2. Putin, who heads the United 
Russia ticket, said a vote for United Russia would ensure 
"stability and continuity."  Deriding the politics of the 
'90s, Putin said "we cannot allow the return to power of 
those who once tried but failed to rule the country." 
 
¶3. (U) The televised address, reportedly paid for by United 
Russia, most certainly will be aired many more times as news 
throughout the evening news cycle.  Over the course of the 
last week, political commentators had speculated that Putin 
would use the address to make a surprise announcement, and 
there was much speculation about what that might be.  The 
fact that Putin recorded the speech November 22 at the 
Ostankino television complex, not the Kremlin, added to the 
flurry of speculation. 
 
Nudging LDPR Across the Finish Line 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Immediately following Putin's address, LDPR leader 
Zhirinovskiy made his appeal to voters in a brief address in 
which he expressed support for the President and his 
policies.  LDPR is currently represented in the Duma but 
recent polls have shown the party's support to be slightly 
below the 7 percent threshold needed to win seats in the next 
Duma.  Zhirinovskiy's appearance is being read by some that 
the Kremlin wants to ensure that LDPR, an "opposition party" 
that supports the president, makes it back to the Duma. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) For someone with a knack for surprises, Putin's 
surprise today was that there were no surprises.  His speech 
was nothing more than an appeal to voters for their support. 
As expectations for United Russia in Sunday's elections 
increase, Putin is putting his popularity on the line to 
ensure the outcome the Kremlin wants, is the outcome the 
Kremlin gets.
