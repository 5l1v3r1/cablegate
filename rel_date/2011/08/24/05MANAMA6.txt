¶1.  The United States and Bahrain signed a bilateral Free 
Trade Agreement (FTA) on September 14, 2004.  Considered to 
be a model FTA, the agreement contains broad commitments to 
open services markets.  Bahrain will accord substantial 
market access across its entire services regime, providing 
among the highest degree of market access of any U.S. FTA 
negotiated to date.  Key services sectors covered by the 
agreement include audiovisual, express delivery, 
telecommunications, computer and related services, 
distribution, healthcare, construction, architecture and 
engineering.  The FTA provides benefits for businesses 
wishing to supply services cross-border as well as businesses 
wishing to establish a presence locally in the other country. 
 The agreement uses a negatives list of sectors specifically 
excluded.  U.S. companies investing in the areas of 
television, radio or other media, fisheries, and oil 
exploration will receive Most Favored Nation status as 
opposed to national treatment.
