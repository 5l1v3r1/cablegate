OF LICENSE 050003636 AND AGREEMENT TA 0864-05 
 
REF: SECSTATE 59286 
 
¶1. Per reftel request, we consulted with Aselsan Electronics 
Industries Director of Airborne and Naval Programs Metin 
Sancar on May 11 regarding license number 050003636 and 
agreement TA 0864-50.  Sancar confirmed both the order and 
the end user.  Sancar said that the contract under license 
no. 050003636 is still active and that, as of 11 May, Aselsan 
had received two of the 21 sets of F-4 aircraft components 
and spare parts.  The remaining 19 sets are expected to 
arrive within the next few months.  According to Sancar, 
communication between Aselsan and the U.S. supplier -- 
Rockwell Collins, Inc. -- is sufficient.  Sancar said the 
aircraft components are being used in accordance with the 
technical assistance agreement and not for any other 
purposes.  He also remarked that the Turkish Air Force (TAF) 
is the sole end user of these items.  Sancar noted that the 
TAF currently has over 100 F-4 aircraft within its order of 
battle, and that over 40 of these have been upgraded.  Sancar 
indicated that the 21 sets of components listed in reftel 
will be used in the TAF's F-4 reconnaissance aircraft. 
 
¶2. Based on the conference call with Sancar -- who was 
extremely knowledgeable and helpful -- we believe Aselsan is 
using the F-4 components properly and is adhering to the 
requisite agreement.
