REF: 08 ISTANBUL 208 
 
1 (U) May Day related violence diminished for a second year 
in Istanbul.  According to Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler, 
108 protestors were detained May Day 2009, compared over 500 
arrests the previous year (reftel). Two labor unions ) 
Confederation of Turkish Labor Unions (Turk-Is) and Hak-Is 
received last minute permission to march on the Ataturk 
Monument in Taksim Square.  This was the first authorized 
march on Taksim Square by union supporters since May Day 
1977, when 36 people were killed.   Following the two labor 
unions, rally, about 5,000 other union supporters were also 
able to march on Taksim Square without much incident.  This 
group included members of parliament from both the opposition 
Republican People,s Party (CHP) and the pro-Kurdish 
Democratic Society Party (DTP), including its leader Ahmet 
Turk.  Violence did break out on some of the side streets 
leading to Taksim Square with reports of protesters throwing 
rocks at the police and shop windows.  Also there was a 
single report of a Molotov cocktail used in an area near 
Taksim.  The police used water cannons and pepper gas to 
control the crowd.  Similar to 2008 and 2007, the city halted 
public transportation in areas surrounding Taksim Square in 
an effect to limit access to the area.  Legal demonstrations 
also occurred in Kadikoy, an opposition held district in 
Istanbul on the Asia side of the city, Cagalayan, and 
Kazilcesme. 
 
Â¶2. (SBU) Comment: Violence was likely curbed this year by the 
government,s recognition of May Day as a national holiday 
along with approval for a &reasonable8 number of union 
supporters to reach the monument at Taksim Square. Last year, 
these demands from labor union leaders were rejected by the 
Istanbul Governor (a Ministry of Interior appointee.)  This 
year, the governor reversed his position.  The ruling AKP 
government also appeared to favor unions that wanted a day 
off at the expense of business groups who suffered 
productively losses because of the holiday. However, even if 
May Day had remained a workday, productivity would have 
likely dropped significantly in Istanbul due to strong 
security measures necessary to control the crowds.
