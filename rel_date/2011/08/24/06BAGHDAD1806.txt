SUBJECT: NATIONAL IRAQI MINORITIES COUNCIL CONFERENCE HOLDS 
SECOND ANNUAL CONFERENCE 
 
 
¶1. (U) On May 27, PolOffs and PolFSN attended the Second 
Annual National Conference of the Iraqi Minorities Council, 
held at Baghdad's Rashid Hotel.  The conference, attended by 
about 250 people, opened with remarks by surprise guest 
Council of Representatives Speaker Mahmoud Mashadani. 
Mashadani told the delegates, government officials, community 
leaders and international representatives present that the 
measure of true democracy in society is the inclusion of all 
citizens including minorities.  He went on to emphasize his 
personal commitment to the protection of minority rights and 
said he would back an Armenian Christian candidate for the 
position of Deputy Minister of State for National Security. 
Shia Arab politician Ali Dabbagh also addressed the group 
calling on minorities to teach the majority politicians about 
their cultures and the issues affecting them. 
 
¶2. (U) Following Mashadani and Dabbagh's remarks the program 
reverted to the previously announced program and agenda. 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General Ashraf Qazi 
spoke of the UN's commitment to the protection of minority 
rights and proposed the creation of a minority bill of 
rights.  Qazi's remarks were followed by a presentation by 
Dr. Hanin Al-Qaddo, CoR member and President of the Iraqi 
Minorities Council.  Qaddo spoke about what it means to be a 
minority and then talked about the specific obligations a 
nation has to assist and protect its minority populations. 
His remarks were followed by discussions led by Council 
members on political participation, social and cultural 
challenges, and constitutional issues. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: The conference appeared to be well received 
by the participants.  Its primary value seemed to be less the 
substance of the discussion than the fact of its occurrence 
for a second year in a row, as well as the guest appearances 
of both Sunni and Shia Arab politicians  such as Mashadani 
and Dabbagh.
