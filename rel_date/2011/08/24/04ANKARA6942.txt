¶1. (SBU) EXBS advisor met with the new DDG for Arms Control 
and Disarmament Bulent Meric (formerly the Disarmament 
Department Head) and staff on December 13. Regarding the 
Wassenaar Arrangement Plenary, Meric stated that Turkey 
agrees with the U.S. that each country applying for 
membership should be judged on it own merits  -- what it can 
contribute -- and not just because the applicant was a member 
in some other non-related organization  (such as the EU). 
Meric requested information concerning the countries that are 
applying for Wassenaar membership, which would allow the GOT 
to better understand the U.S. position on each of the 
applicants.  This information would be very useful prior to 
the upcoming silence procedure expected to begin next 
February. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Meric also stated that Turkey will most likely not 
change its stance on the Cyprus application, unless new 
information is provided concerning the benefit to the WA of 
the inclusion of Cyprus. (Comment: In the run up to the 
December 17 EU Summit, Turkey has come under increased 
pressure from European capitals to drop opposition to Cypriot 
membership in organizations like Wassenaar.  How the EU 
handles the Cyprus issue at the EU Summit may influence the 
GOT's willingness to consider whether the GOC is able to 
contribute meaningfully to the Wassenaar Arrangement work.)
