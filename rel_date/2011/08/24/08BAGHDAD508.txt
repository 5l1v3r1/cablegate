SUBJECT: MESSAGE TO PRTS: PROVINCIAL INVESTMENT BUDGET 
EXECUTION IN 2008 
 
REF: BAGHDAD 449 
 
¶1. The Council of Representatives passed the 2008 federal 
budget on Wednesday, February 13 (Reftel A), and ratification 
by the Presidency Council is imminent. Buoyed by record oil 
earnings, the 2008 budget is the most ambitious in Iraq's 
history. Totaling USD 49.9 billion, it contains USD 13.1 
billion for capital expenditures of which USD 2.5 billion has 
been allocated for the KRG. Provincial construction and 
development grants are budgeted at USD 3.3 billion, a 38 
percent increase from 2007. 
 
¶2. As we move forward in 2008, it is crucial for the GoI to 
consolidate the improved security environment through good 
governance, the provision of services, and economic 
development. The USD 3.3 billion allocated for provincial 
capital projects provides the resources to deliver on these 
objectives. It will take effective budget execution to turn 
these goals into reality. Nothing will do more to help 
federal and provincial authorities earn the trust of the 
populace and undermine the insurgency. 
 
¶3. The provinces made progress in the past year, particularly 
since many had to work to spend a substantial portion of 
their 2006 funding in addition to what they received in 2007. 
However, much remains to be accomplished. The resources are 
there, but they must be effectively utilized to make a 
difference in people's lives. 
 
¶4. Improving budget execution must be our top priority this 
year. PRT staff at all levels should be helping counterparts 
develop, contract and carry out capital projects using GoI 
funding streams. Whenever possible our scarce funds should be 
used to leverage GoI funding streams, through co-financing or 
other innovative means. If additional staff or resources are 
needed for you to have the necessary impact, please work 
through the Office of Provincial Affairs to make your needs 
known. The Embassy is prepared to mobilize resources to 
support your work in this crucial area.
