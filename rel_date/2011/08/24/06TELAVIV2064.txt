¶1. On May 24, 2006 Commercial Officer John Coronado and 
Commercial Specialist Yael Torres conducted a Pre-License 
Check at the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) 
located at: 24 Reuven Street, Ness-Ziona 74100, Israel. 
Named institute is listed in BIS application D355002 as the 
end-user for 0.5 milligram Cholera toxin, a subunit from 
Vibrio, controlled by the U.S. Bureau of Industry & Security 
for chemical or biological warfare reasons. 
 
¶2. Coronado and Torres met with Dr. Zvi Teitelbaum, Head of 
the IIBR Medicinal Chemistry Research Division and Dr. 
(Mrs.) Adina Amir, one of the scientists/investigators on 
the corneal epithelial cells research that involves the use 
of listed controlled substance.  Contact information for 
this office is tel: (972-8) 938-16918 and (972-8) 938-1504, 
fax: (972-8) 940-7686, emails: tzvi@iibr.gov.il and 
amir@iibr.gov.il.  Ministry of Defense representative Mr. 
Ilan Mesushan escorted Coronado and Torres to the IIBR 
premises and attended the meeting. Mr. Shlomo Shapira, Head 
of Pharmacology and Mrs. Shlomit from the IIBR research team 
also attended the meeting. The head of IIBR security was 
also present at all times during this meeting. 
 
¶3. Dr. Teitelbaum and Dr. Amir provided an overview of the 
Institute. The Israel Institute for Biological Research is a 
governmental, applied research institute specializing in the 
fields of biology, medicinal chemistry and environmental 
sciences, under the jurisdiction of the Israeli Prime 
Minister's Office. It is located approximately 20 kilometers 
south of Tel Aviv. The staff is comprised of 350 employees, 
including 150 scientists and 160 technicians. The institute 
is located within a high-security compound, surrounded by an 
electronic fence and guarded 24 hours by armed guards and a 
CCTV system. The entrance to the compound is restricted and 
visitors must be accompanied at all times. 
 
¶4. Throughout its history, stories have circulated about the 
IIBR's alleged research and activities in the areas of 
chemical and biological warfare projects. 
 
¶5. The IIBR works closely with Israel's Ministry of Defense, 
Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment and Ministry of 
Agriculture. International authorities and institutions 
including the U.S. Public Health Services, Center for 
Disease Control, U.S. Army Medical Research and Development 
Command, the World Health Organization, US-Israel Binational 
Science Foundation, National Foundation of Cancer Research 
and the German Ministry for Scientific Research and 
Technology sponsor some of IIBR's research projects. In 
addition, IIBR is regularly contracted by international and 
domestic companies to undertake R&D projects. 
 
¶6. Following the overview, Coronado and Torres visited the 
research area located in a separate building. Entry to this 
building is limited to staff with appropriate access cards. 
IIBR commented that the handling and storage protocols for 
the material listed in BIS application D355002 would follow 
ISO 9002 standards, and that refrigeration, if necessary, 
would be in a locked refrigeration unit.  Final handling and 
storage protocols may be modified, based on specifications 
from the exporter. 
 
¶7. Dr. Amir provided Embassy officials with a copy of the 
end-user statement and the order for 500 micrograms, from 
Sigma catalog # C8180, dated February 20, 2006. The order 
was addressed to the local distributor, Sigma Israel 
Chemical Company.  The end-user statement detailed that the 
cholera toxin will be used as one of the supplements needed 
to grow primary corneal epithelial cells in-vitro, citing 
common practice for this type of research. 
 
¶8. The meeting lasted 1.5 hr and took place approximately 
one month after Post initiated its first call. Post 
initiated contact with the Institute upon receipt of the PLC 
request, but was informed that the principal investigators 
were not available until the end of May. As such, IIBR 
requested the May 24, 2006 visit. 
 
¶9. RECOMMENDATION:  All indications are that IIBR is engaged 
in research in the fields of national health and security 
concerns, as well as legitimate commercial activities.  Post 
believes that the requested substance listed in BIS 
application D355002 is for purely scientific/medical 
research and that the Israel Institute of Biological 
Research will comply with the conditions of the license. 
 
¶9. Post considers this PLC to be complete, unless BIS 
requests further action.  Post contact is Commercial Officer 
John Coronado email: John.Coronado@mail.doc.gov or telephone 
(972-3) 519-7471.
