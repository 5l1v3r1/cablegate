SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR DAS SPIRNAK'S VISIT TO MOROCCO 
 
REF: RABAT 0231 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  DAS Spirnak, we are looking forward to 
your visit to Morocco.  The Kingdom is a country "on the 
move", in the throes, albeit unevenly, of change and reform 
as detailed in reftel.  Morocco is one of our strongest 
allies in the Broader Middle East and North Africa (BMENA) 
region.  Morocco's top priority is U.S. and broader 
international support for its position on the Western Sahara 
territorial dispute and for North African integration.  You 
will surely be asked about our position, as well as about a 
possible visit by the Secretary.  Morocco deeply appreciates 
the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and would like 
to see some similar mechanism remain in place for the future. 
 End Summary. 
 
-------------------- 
Forum for The Future 
-------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) As the host of the first Forum for the Future 
(FFF), Morocco has been a long-time supporter of the concept. 
 Secretary General Youssef Amrani (number two at the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation) told Charge on March 17 
that he is personally committed to a successful FFF.  Charge 
noted that the USG feels strongly that a parallel civil 
society forum is needed during the FFF, and Amrani indicated 
that it should be on the agenda for the coordinating meeting, 
which would include the Governments of Morocco, Italy and the 
United States, as well as No Peace Without Justice from 
Turkey and the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights (OMDH). 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) MFA Deskoff Mouaad Ibriz informed PolOff on March 
27 that a de-briefing with BMENA civil society leaders would 
not be part of the coordinating meeting agenda next week 
because Morocco did not receive such a request from No Peace 
without Justice or OMDH.  Ibriz noted that both partner NGOs 
would be able to disseminate any information from the 
coordination meeting with other NGOs in upcoming meetings in 
May.  You will want to reinforce the importance of including 
civil society in the FFF meeting this fall.  You should 
anticipate questions regarding the new Obama administration's 
commitment to the BMENA process. Ambassador Amrani, who 
coordinated the First Forum in Morocco with Secretary Powell, 
will likely push for Secretary Clinton's participation in the 
upcoming Forum for the Future. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Mission Strategic Goals and MEPI 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Mission strategic goals are, in order, economic 
growth and reform, countering terror, promoting U.S.-Moroccan 
partnership, enhancing democracy and governance, and 
resolving regional conflicts while maintaining close 
strategic cooperation.  With regard to economic growth and 
reform, we believe expanding Morocco's economic base will do 
as much to address popular dissatisfaction with the political 
system as will strengthening democratic institutions. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) MEPI is very active in Morocco due in large part to 
the active civil society and the freedoms enjoyed in the 
country.  There are several ongoing MEPI local grants as well 
as MEPI programs funded from Washington.  We see MEPI as a 
vital instrument to boost Moroccan civil society, while 
Morocco serves as a platform, both exemplary and logistically 
for MEPI goals in the region.  Our most recent MEPI project, 
launched on March 21, is the Women's Election Program.  It 
focuses on encouraging women to run as candidates in the 
upcoming June 2009 local elections.  Though most Moroccan 
partners welcome the opportunity to work with MEPI and would 
like to see a similar program continue in the new 
administration, some have argued that it should be renamed. 
Local young activists contend that the words &Middle East8 
in the MEPI title bring an unwelcome association with 
controversial U.S. policies in the region. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Other recent and ongoing MEPI efforts include 
support for civil society and youth organizations, developing 
freedom of expression via the Internet, supporting 
development of democratic leaders, technical assistance to 
meet environmental obligations under the FTA, political party 
training and capacity building, and the Financial Services 
Volunteer Corps.  In 2007, MEPI funded the first-ever 
international observation of the Moroccan parliamentary 
elections through the National Democratic Institute (NDI). 
Although turnout was low and plagued by protest votes and 
frequent vote buying, we believe the observation promoted 
more transparent management of the voting process and a 
relative absence of government manipulation.  Other 
USG-funded projects support anti-corruption efforts (with the 
American Bar Association) and prison reform to undermine the 
foundations of extremism.  (Note:  MEPI provided the needed 
technical support for this S/CT funded project.  End note.) 
 
---------------------------- 
MEPI-Funded Election Program 
---------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Representatives from the NDI and the International 
Republican Institute (IRI) will brief you on their activities 
and future plans for the recently launched, MEPI-funded 
Women's Election Project.  Post proposed this project to MEPI 
Washington after the Government of Morocco negotiated an 
agreement with political parties reserving approximately 
3,000 local council seats for women.  The project is focused 
on training women how to effectively run for office in the 
upcoming local elections to take advantage of the change. 
The Mission is extremely grateful to MEPI Washington for 
accepting and funding our request in record time. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) IRI Resident Director Jamie Tronnes informed PolOff 
that by March 28, IRI will have already trained more than 500 
women candidates for the June elections, and it is apparently 
being inundated with requests from Morocco's political 
parties to train more women candidates.  The fact that so 
many women are being trained is a good indication that there 
will be enough women candidates to fill the available 3,000 
seats that will be up for grabs. 
 
-------------- 
Other Meetings 
-------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) In addition to the FFF meeting, you will have the 
opportunity to meet our interagency Democracy Working Group 
and discuss the range of our democracy and reform activities. 
 Our Public Affairs Section (PAS) is organizing a working 
dinner with American and Moroccan academics and Moroccan MEPI 
exchange program alumni.  PAS is also organizing a My Arabic 
Library book distribution and a Citizen Journalism Youth 
Blogging Event targeting youth ages 10-16. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Finally, you will also have the opportunity to 
meet participants in the recent, MEPI alumni sponsored 
Caravan for Young Leaders program as well as representatives 
from the MEPI-sponsored Women In Technology program and MEPI 
Women's Election Program.  At the Ministry of Justice's 
National Judicial Training Institute, you will see a 
demonstration of the 15 MEPI-funded e-learning modules on the 
family code and labor laws designed by the American Bar 
Association.  During each of your engagements with MEPI 
alumni and project implementers, you may wish to stress that 
MEPI will continue under the new Administration (although it 
may evolve), and encourage local NGOs to continue to submit 
proposals for the MEPI local grant program.
