In Today's Papers 
 
CHP-MHP War of Words over Gul's Presidential Drive 
All papers report the opposition CHP leader Deniz Baykal accused the 
extreme-nationalist MHP of paving the way for Abdullah Gul to become 
president.  Baykal criticized the MHP's participation in the 
presidential election in parliament, prompting the MHP to respond by 
criticizing the CHP for not taking part in the voting.  "The CHP has 
begun to oppose the opposition as well; the party is placing its 
hopes on forces outside democracy," MHP Secretary-General Cihan 
Pacaci said. 
 
Meanwhile, the left-leaning opposition DSP called on the CHP to 
support its candidate, Tayfun Icli, in the remaining rounds of the 
presidential race since the two candidates receiving most votes 
would compete in the third round slated for August 28. 
 
Anti-Defamation League Adopts Armenian Genocide Claims 
All papers report the US-based Anti-Defamation League (ADL) released 
a statement Tuesday saying Turkey's actions against Armenians during 
World War I years "were tantamount to genocide."  ADL National 
Director Abraham Foxman said "We have never negated, but have always 
described the painful events of 1915-1918 perpetrated by the Ottoman 
Empire against the Armenians as massacres and atrocities." 
 
Papers report Turkish sources said the shift in the ADL stance could 
negatively impact Turkey's close relationship with Israel.  Turkish 
Foreign Ministry (MFA) said in a statement yesterday, "The 
definition of the 1915 events in the statement released by the ADL 
as 'genocide' is both historically and legally baseless."  The MFA 
added that the Jewish community in Turkey was a part of Turkish 
society.  "We consider this statement, which is also unjust against 
the memory of victims of the Holocaust, unfortunate.  We expect the 
ADL to correct their mistake," the MFA stressed. 
 
Mainstream Sabah believes the change in the stance of Jewish groups 
was due to Turkey's rapprochement with Hamas and Iran, predicting 
that efforts to pass an Armenian genocide resolution by the US 
congress will intensify.  Mainstream Milliyet warns that the shift 
in the ADL position might influence other Jewish groups in the US, 
leading to a further isolation of Turkey.  The paper also reports 
Ankara has asked Israel to intervene in the crisis. 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports Israeli President Shimon Peres will 
phone Erdogan today to discuss the matter, and other papers say 
Ankara will ask Israel to press the ADL to reverse its decision. 
The Israeli Embassy in Ankara released a statement announcing there 
was no change in its position.  Israeli Ambassador Pinhas Avivi will 
discuss the issue with Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul during a 
farewell call on the FM today, say papers. 
 
Editorial Commentary on ADL Shift Regarding Armenian Genocide 
Semih Idiz writes in the mainstream daily Milliyet: "Turkey has so 
far enjoyed the support of the Jewish lobby in the prevention of the 
approval of an Armenian genocide resolution in the US Congress. 
This support mainly was a result of the strength of Turkish-American 
as well as Turkish-Israeli relations.  Things started to change 
following the Iraq occupation and Israel-Palestine conflict, when 
anti-American and anti-Israeli feelings peaked.  Jewish 
organizations in the US have started wondering why they should be 
helping out Turks when Turks hate them.  The recent decision by the 
ADL is not something that happened overnight.  The world system 
works on the basis of reciprocity and Jews do not have reason enough 
to support Turkey anymore.  Even though the ADL noted it remained 
opposed to an Armenian genocide resolution in the Congress, the fact 
of the matter is that the Congress will certainly make note of the 
ADL's recognition of genocide.  This development is a serious loss 
for Turkey." 
 
Iraqi Vice-President Hashimi Comes to Turkey 
Sabah, Zaman:  PM Erdogan invited Iraqi First Deputy President Sunni 
 
ANKARA 00002210  002 OF 003 
 
 
leader Tariq Al-Hashimi to Ankara to try to help solve the 
government crisis in Iraq.  Mainstream Sabah reports that Erdogan 
sent the Prime Ministry's plane to Iraq for Hashimi today and will 
host a dinner in honor of Hashimi tonight.  Islamist oriented Zaman 
reports that Shiite Vice-President Adil Abdul-Mahdi is also planning 
to visit Turkey soon. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Iraq 
Kubilay Celik writes in the tabloid-nationalist daily Tercuman: "The 
US is searching to find a way out of the Iraqi quagmire.  US 
presidents are traditionally labeled lame ducks during their last 
year in office.  Given President Bush's situation vis-`-vis the Iraq 
war, I think he should be called a 'lost duck.'  Under growing 
pressure from the American public and the Democrats, the Washington 
administration is now seriously talking about withdrawal.  Given the 
presence of 160,000 soldiers, there are two likely options, just as 
discussed by Democratic Party candidates recently: pulling forces 
out through the south which means through Kuwait, or through the 
north which means Turkey.  Such debates give a clear indication that 
sooner or later a pull-out plan from Iraq will be implemented.  When 
things get serious, Washington will knock on the door for sure. 
Turkey has to be prepared for such a development." 
 
US Gives Green Light to Greek Cypriot Oil Exploration 
 Cumhuriyet, Milliyet report that the US State Department has 
extended support to the Greek Cypriot Government by saying the Greek 
Cypriot Government, as a 'sovereign nation,' has the right to 
request bids for oil and natural gas exploration within its own 
economic zone.  The US State Department confirmed that one US firm 
was among the bidders and stated that the involvement of US firms in 
such investment is a business decision. Papers quote a State 
Department official saying that 'Washington is not a party to the 
dispute between Greek Cypriots and Turkey.  The controversy, 
however, points to the need for all parties to focus on restarting 
the UN's Good Office's Mission to forge a comprehensive Cyprus 
settlement that reunifies the island in a bi-zonal, bi-communal 
federation.' 
 
DTP Will Redefine the Kurdish Problem 
Yeni Safak reports that at its party convention on October 28, DTP 
is going to "redefine the Kurdish problem."  The commission that 
includes DTP Vice Chairmen Nurettin Demirtas, Selma Irmak and 
Diyarbakir Mayor Osman Baydemir is conducting preparatory work for 
the convention.  The board members will work on a proposal to define 
the Kurdish problem and suggest approaches to solutions to be raised 
in the parliament.
