(SBU) Global Affairs officer delivered ref A registration 
information August 30 to MFA Nuclear Nonproliferation Desk 
Officer Joerg Polster.  Polster said the German Government 
had ruled out sending a minister to participate in the 
September 16 Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) 
ministerial, but had not yet taken a decision on whether to 
send a working level representative to observe the meeting. 
Polster reiterated the German Government's commitment to 
phase out nuclear power facilities would make it politically 
unfeasible to participate in GNEP, but stressed German 
interest in cooperating on the nonproliferation and nuclear 
security aspects.  Post will continue to follow up with 
relevant German ministries and report any subsequent response 
septel.
