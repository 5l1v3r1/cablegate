SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS CHAIR TO CONSIDER POSTPONEMENT OF 
"WAR CRIMES" CONFERENCE 
 
---------------- 
(SBU) KEY POINTS 
---------------- 
 
-- At a February 4 meeting with National Human Rights 
Committee Chairman Dr. Ali Said Al-Marri, Ambassador 
expressed strong concern over the planned February 22-24 
conference co-sponsored by the government-funded NHRC that 
will gather international NGO's to debate alleged "Israeli 
war crimes" in Gaza. 
 
-- Ambassador noted that the conference was certain to become 
a one-sided platform for criticizing Israel.  Coupled with 
the timing of the conference, scheduled to occur just a few 
days after the US-Islamic World Forum, the USG could well 
decide not to participate in the Forum. 
 
-- Pressed by Ambassador about including treatment of human 
rights violations by Hamas in the agenda, Al-Marri welcomed 
the participation of NGOs with knowledge of such violations. 
 
-- Al-Marri pledged to discuss with his counterparts in the 
Qatar human rights community the possibility of postponing 
the conference and report back to Ambassador.  He did not 
agree to seek a cancellation of the conference. 
 
-------- 
COMMENTS 
-------- 
 
-- The February 22-24 Conference has received extensive media 
coverage, so it is unlikely the government-funded organizers 
will even postpone the event, even if Dr. Al-Marri is 
inclined to make that recommendation. 
 
-- The NHRC has promised to provide us with a list of 
conference invitees, which we will provide to Department 
immediately upon receipt. 
 
End Key Points and Comments. 
 
¶1. (SBU)  At a February 4 meeting with National Human Rights 
Committee (NHRC) Chairman Ali Said Al-Marri, Ambassador 
expressed deep concern over the planned February 22-24 
"International Conference for the Promotion of Palestinian 
Rights: Towards a Sustainable Active Alliance."  The 
Conference, which seeks "to monitor, document and publicize 
Israeli violations of Palestinian inalienable rights" will be 
co-sponsored by the NHRC and the Arab Democracy Foundation 
(ADF) (Note:  The ADF is a GOQ-funded organization whose 
mission is to promote the transition to democracy in the 
region. As NHRC Chairman, Al-Marri is also a Trustee of the 
ADF.  End Note) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador noted that the Conference was scheduled 
to take place in Doha February 22-24, less than one week 
after the February 14-16 U.S. Islamic World Forum.  He said 
that the closeness of the events could easily lead to the 
perception that the two events were linked.  Given that the 
"human rights" conference is certain to devolve into a 
one-sided platform to criticize Israeli actions in Gaza, it 
could well be very difficult for the U.S. to participate in 
the Forum. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Al-Marri stated that the conference was a gathering 
of regional and international NGOs, including some from the 
U.S, seeking to document Israeli actions in Gaza.  When 
Ambassador pointed out that the agenda did not include a 
review of Hamas' actions during the conflict, the chairman 
said he welcomed the participation of other NGOs which could 
shed light on violations by Hamas. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Al-Marri pledged to discuss with his counterparts in 
the Qatar human rights community the possibility of 
postponing the conference.  He told Ambassador that he would 
report back to him on February 5 concerning these discussions.
