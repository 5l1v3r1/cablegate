(SBU) Post delievered reftel demarche to Pablo Yuste and 
Mara Eugenia Martnez-Sanz in the Spanish Agency for 
International Cooperation's (AECI) Office of Humanitarian 
Action.  They stated that of the 20 million euros Spain 
pledged in Tokyo, 8.5 million will be devoted to humanitarian 
aid.  Of this total, 4.5 million euros will be allocated for 
the World Food Program; 1 million to UNHCR with another 1 
million likely to follow; 500,000 for FAO, and 300,000 for 
OCHA.  Yuste also indicated that Spain is looking to provide 
assistance in areas where other donors are not giving, such 
as transportation.  AECI will hold back some small portion of 
the funds pending evolution of the conflict in order to see 
where it is most needed.  AECI representatives took on board 
our points about front-loading assistance but did not specify 
the pace at which funds will be disbursed.
