1.(SBU) Econoff delivered reftel nonpaper to Liu Bing, an 
official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Department 
of International Organizations as it relates to the 
implementation of UNSCR resolutions.  Liu said he would 
forward the paper to the relevant officials, but declined to 
comment further.  Separately, Poloff conveyed reftel to the 
MFA Arms Control and Disarmament Department Deputy Director

MFA's purview even though the financial transactions involved 
were all proliferation-related but agreed to accept the 
demarche for "information purposes."

People's Bank of China anti-money laundering office.
