SAPS to be assisted by specialized units 
 
¶3.  Minister of Police Nathi Mthethwa announced that the South 
African Police Service (SAPS) will be deploying members of 
specialized tactical teams to provide operational support at grass 
roots level.  According to Mthethwa, the deployment of these units 
is part of the SAPS turnaround strategy adopted after the release of 
crime statistics in October, and is intended to enhance techniques 
aimed at fighting crime.  Tactical teams will be deployed in some 
business areas, particularly in informal and small businesses, and 
residential areas where house robberies are taking place.  Crime 
experts have welcomed the deployment of tactical teams to local 
police stations, calling it "a right move" for government.  Analysts 
have expressed their confidence in this decision but emphasized that 
it would need strategic coordination to ensure that the units work 
cooperatively to stamp out criminals. (November, 24, 2009, Buanews)
