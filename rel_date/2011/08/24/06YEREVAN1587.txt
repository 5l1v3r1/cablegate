protect accordingly. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We delivered reftel points to Valery Mkrtumyan, head 
of the MFA's International Organizations Department. 
Mkrtumyan said that Armenia has voted in favor of the Cuba 
Embargo Resolution in the past, and likely would be unwilling 
to change that voting pattern at this time.  He said he would 
pass the information to Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian to 
determine Armenia's position on the Australian amendment.
