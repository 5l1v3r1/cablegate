SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED ON UNGA RESOLUTION ON CHILDREN 
AND HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN LEBANON 
 
REF: SECSTATE 176793 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel talking points to Director 
of International Policy on Civil and Political Rights Dr. 
Luis Angel Benavides and Director of International Policy on 
Economic, Social, Cultural and Minority Groups, both of the 
Secretariat of Foreign Relations (SRE). Benavides responded 
 
SIPDIS 
that the Mexican government has no predetermined position on 
the resolution and will discuss the matter with their 
colleagues in New York. Salazar added that issues involving 
the Middle East are often delicate ones and noted that Mexico 
abstained from a vote on the resolution on Occupied 
Palestinian Territory that passed during the first Special 
Session of the Human Rights Council. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COMMENT:  Mexico voted in favor of the resolution 
condemning Israel for actions in Lebanon during the second 
Special Session of the Human Rights Council, despite having 
acknowledged at the time the resolution's imbalance in its 
failure to mention actions of Hezbollah or Israeli victims of 
the violence. End comment.
