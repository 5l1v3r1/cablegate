SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: RENEWING THE SUDAN SPECIAL 
RAPPORTEUR MANDATE AT THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
 
REF: STATE 55852 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche on June 5 to MFA 
Department for Human Rights section chief Andrey Lancjikov, 
who said that Russia's position on extending the mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur for Sudan was "still under 
consideration."  He explained that on June 4, the MFA had 
discussed this issue with the EU Troika, which also asked 
Russia to support extending the mandate.  Russian 
representatives were also holding discussions with Africa 
Group members in Geneva. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Lancjikov said that it would be easier to discuss 
this issue if there was a draft resolution to which all sides 
could refer.  He thought it could be possible to get the 
Africa Group to support a resolution in principle, but 
details could not be considered until a draft was circulated. 
 Lancjikov added that it was troubling that the EU and U.S. 
were considering inserting into the resolution a request for 
the Special Rapporteur to present a report on the situation 
in Sudan during the 2010 session of the Human Rights Council 
when it did not appear that the most recently requested 
report had been completed.
