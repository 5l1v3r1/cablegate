SUBJECT: CPA: PROGRESS MADE IN SHARING PETROLEUM DATA 
 
 
¶1. Summary. Under the CPA, the Government of National Unity 
is required to share information on oil production, revenues 
and contracts with the Government of Southern Sudan (GOSS). 
In the past, the GOSS has repeatedly alleged that this 
information is not being made available.  Now, it appears 
that some northern officials are making efforts to share 
information more freely, with the Director General of the 
Petroleum Unit of the GOSS having access to data. Problems 
remain with GOSS lack of technical capacity in understanding 
the intricacies of the material being made available, as well 
as problems in dissemination of the information within the 
GOSS. The upcoming visits of a USG-funded oil advisor offers 
the opportunity to further improve this aspect of CPA 
implementation. End Summary. 
 
¶2. In a series of meetings with Embassy officers, officials 
from the GNU Ministry of Energy and Mining (MEM) and the GOSS 
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning confirmed progress 
in sharing of information on the petroleum sector in Sudan. 
Hamad El Neel, Deputy Secretary General at MEM, met with 
Econoff on March 24 and reviewed recent developments. The 
meeting was a follow up to El Neel's recent presentation to 
the Wealth Sharing working group of the Assessment and 
Evaluation Commission (AEC). El Neel elaborated on his 
efforts to improve liaison with the GOSS and stressed that he 
has engaged the SPLM members of the Joint Technical Committee 
for Monitoring Net Oil Revenues (the Joint Committee) in 
training and information sessions at MEM. He also arranged 
for the Norwegian oil advisor to provide training to the 
group. He noted that he has given instructions to the MEM 
staff that all documents of the MEM, including production 
sharing agreements, be made available to Yousif Ramadan, 
Director General of the Petroleum Unit of the GOSS Ministry 
of Finance and Economic Planning. Ramadan is one of five SPLM 
representatives on the Joint Committee. 
 
¶3.  On March 27, Emboffs met with Yousif Ramadan to verify 
that he does indeed have access to information at MEM. 
Ramadan confirmed that he has an excellent working 
relationship with El Neel and that he now has no problem in 
getting information from MEM.  When pressed on how he shares 
the information available with the GOSS offices in Juba, 
Ramadan said that he has been sending figures on oil revenues 
to the Minister of Finance, Arthur Akuien Chol and his 
replacement. (Comment. Chol was dismissed from his job 
earlier this month.) Ramadan said he seldom provides 
information to political leaders in the South.  Ramadan, an 
accountant, freely admits that he does not have the technical 
knowledge to understand all the information he has access to. 
 Interestingly, he expressed confidence in the revenue 
sharing arrangements now in place, noting that oil production 
in Sudan is organized by several consortia, and the members 
of each consortium, including the Asian oil companies, demand 
figures for production sharing and revenue calculations. 
 
¶4. On April 1, Econoff attended a lunch, hosted by MEM, 
bringing together the members of the Joint Committee. The 
lunch followed the regular monthly meeting of the Joint 
Committee. Also attending the lunch were: El Sheik El Mak, 
Under Secretary of the Ministry of National Finance and 
Economy (GNU); Aggrey Tisa Sabuni, Acting Under Secretary, 
Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (GOSS); and, 
Archangelo Okwang, Ministry of Petroleum (GOSS). Members of 
the Joint Committee confirmed that they have met regularly 
since mid-2005, and now have convened more than twenty times. 
 (Comment: The fact the Joint Committee has been meeting for 
some time and the information on oil production is not 
circulating in offices in Juba underlines the problem of 
communication within the GOSS.) 
 
¶5. The May visit of an U.S. oil advisor provides an 
opportunity to build on the improved information sharing now 
emerging between the GNU and the GOSS.  Embassy recommends a 
meeting of the advisor with members of the Joint Committee, 
including Ramadan and El Neel to assess the needs of the GOSS 
for capacity building in order to benefit from the 
information available to the GOSS.
