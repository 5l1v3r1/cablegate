SUBJECT: INDONESIA - TRILATERAL STRATEGIC ISSUES 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  The missions of Australia, the U.S. and Japan in 
Indonesia, at a September 20 meeting, agreed to pursue several 
issues in close coordination, including avian influenza sample 
sharing, encouraging better Government of Indonesia (GOI) compliance 
with UN 1267 Al-Qaeda-related asset freezing, and air and port 
security.  Other issues raised for further discussion include 
avoided deforestation and climate change and political outlook for 
the 2009 elections in Indonesia.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Australian Embassy hosted a meeting with the U.S. and 
Japan on September 20 to discuss trilateral strategic issues.  The 
goal was to enhance existing cooperation and coordination beyond 
counter-terrorism.  The three missions agreed to several areas of 
mutual cooperation, including to raise with the Government as 
Indonesia (GOI) as appropriate.  These include: 
 
-- Urging the GOI to resume full avian influenza sample sharing. 
 
-- Encouraging better GOI compliance with UN 1267 Freezing of Al 
Qaeda-related assets. 
 
-- Approaching the GOI on permission for Australian and U.S. air 
marshals to bring weapons on flights and to store them securely at 
Indonesian airports between flights. 
 
-- Indonesia's political outlook for 2009 elections. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On avian influenza sample sharing, all three missions 
discussed the fact that only 4 of the last 26 samples were shared, 
and of the 4, only one worked.  The Japan Embassy said former Prime 
Minister Abe had raised it with the GOI and all agreed it is a 
vitally important issue.  On the issue of UN 1267 asset freezing 
compliance, we decided to add this to the regular meetings of the 
Trilateral Counter-terrorism Group the U.S. Embassy already chairs 
with other missions.  All three missions agreed to raise it as 
appropriate with the GOI.  Australia had approximately 41 scheduled 
return flights to Indonesia each week and the U.S. only one 
(Continental Guam to Singapore), and agreed to take the lead on the 
air marshal issue.  The U.S. has raised the issue with the GOI most 
recently.  TSA hosted an Indonesia delegation to the U.S. to meet 
with Federal Air Marshals in August 2007 and has requested a follow 
on meeting for November with the GOI's Ministry of Transportation. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) On climate change, former Prime Minister Abe raised with 
the GOI, reducing greenhouse gases by half by 2050.  Indonesia has 
50% of the world's peat forests and avoided deforestation and 
reforestation are crucial.  We agreed this would be a useful topic 
for discussion at future trilateral meetings.  We also discussed 
ways to encourage Indonesia's constructive foreign policy role in 
the United Nations Security Council, the Middle East and Iran.
