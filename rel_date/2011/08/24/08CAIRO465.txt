REF: SECSTATE 23596 
 
¶1. (U)  Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) confirmed 
that Egypt will participate in the Organization of Islamic 
Conferences (OIC) Summit in Dakar from March 13-14. The 
Egyptian delegation's point of contact for meeting requests 
is Mohamed Hilal, Office of the Cabinet of the Foreign 
Minister. Mr. Hilal may be reached in Dakar at the following 
local cell phone number:  00 221 77 276 8776.  We have 
provided contact information for the U.S. delegation to Mr. 
Hilal. 
 
¶2. (U)  In response to the request for a brief background 
paragraph on Egypt's involvement in the OIC, we suggest the 
following: 
 
Egypt is actively engaged in the OIC and maintains an 
accredited, permanent office to the OIC in Jeddah.  At the 
Dakar summit, Egypt will present its proposal to host the 
next OIC summit, which will be held in 2011.  If its proposal 
is accepted, Egypt will assume the presidency of the OIC in 
2011, for a 3-year term.  Egypt's focus in Dakar will include 
the ongoing revision of the OIC,s charter.  Other issues 
Egypt traditionally focuses on in the OIC include legal 
mechanisms for addressing defamation of religion (a 
particularly sensitive issue this year, due to the ongoing 
Danish cartoon issue, and the impending release of a Dutch 
film allegedly offensive to Islam), the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, and issues of women and development.
