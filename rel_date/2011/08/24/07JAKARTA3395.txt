SUBJECT: SENATOR KERRY AT THE BALI CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE 
 
REF: JAKARTA 3363 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  From December 9-11, Senator John Kerry 
(D-MA) attended the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) talks in Bali, Indonesia.  During the 
visit, Kerry met Indonesian President Yudhoyono, the 
Indonesian Environment Minister, and a group of Indonesian 
legislators.  The Senator also held numerous bilateral 
meetings, convened a roundtable with key NGOs, and met with 
the media.  Throughout the course of his visit, Kerry 
consistently underscored the importance of immediate action 
on climate change.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) A WHIRLWIND TRIP:  Senator Kerry was the sole 
representative of the U.S. Senate in Bali after voting 
scheduling conflicts compelled three separate CODELs to 
cancel plans to attend the UNFCCC talks.  (Note: 
Representative Faleomavaega was in Bali from November 28 
through December 5.)   Senator Kerry was also forced to pare 
back his time in Bali in order to accommodate the Senate 
voting schedule, ultimately limiting his visit to 36 hours. 
Reftel reviews his meeting with President Yudhoyono. 
 
¶3. (U) MEETING WITH LEGISLATORS:  On December 10, Senator 
Kerry hosted a breakfast for members of the Indonesian 
Parliament (DPR) and their staffs.  Simone Patrice Morin 
(Golkar), H. Achmad Farial (PPP), and Airlangga Hartarto 
(Golkar) represented the DPR at the breakfast and discussed 
Indonesia's environmental challenges.  Hartarto talked about 
the importance of developing sustainable ways to use 
Indonesia's dwindling forests, while H. Achmad Farial 
outlined the political challenges associated with the central 
government's use of fuel subsidies. 
 
¶4.  (U) Senator Kerry urged the legislators to do their part 
to address climate change.  Kerry acknowledged the political 
high wire act required to balance constituent and corporate 
interests while moving forward on climate change, but 
underscored the need for immediate action.  When Senator 
Kerry asked the legislators what the United States could do 
in order to help Indonesia address its environmental 
challenges, the legislators stressed the need for 
collaboration on technology transfers and capacity building. 
 
 
¶5.  (U) A PACKED SCHEDULE:  During the course of Senator 
Kerry's 36 hours attending the UNFCCC talks in Bali, Kerry 
held bilateral talks with the French delegation, China, 
Australia, Japan, Germany, the EU, a group of European 
Parliamentarians, and the Association of Small Island States 
(AOSIS).  Senator Kerry also met with approximately 25 people 
from the international environmental NGO community, discussed 
the status of the UNFCCC negotiations with State Department 
Climate Negotiator Harlan Watson, and delivered the keynote 
address to a gathering of several hundred people from the 
United States Climate Action Network (USCAN). 
 
¶6.  (U) Senator Kerry also conducted a press conference and 
held one-one-one interviews with AP, BBC, and the Washington 
Post.  He also appeared with newly installed Australian 
Environment Minister Peter Garrett for a photo spray. 
 
¶7. (U) THE NEED FOR ACTION ASAP:  Throughout Senator Kerry's 
visit, he called for a "global solution" to the climate 
change issue.  Kerry stressed that the United States should 
take a global leadership role in forging a new climate change 
treaty and said the Congress should adopt mandatory emissions 
limits by 2009, if not sooner.  Senator Kerry also 
consistently urged developing nations to avoid making the 
same mistakes the United States and other industrialized 
countries have been making since the Industrial Revolution. 
 
 
¶8. (U) This message was cleared by Senator Kerry's office.
