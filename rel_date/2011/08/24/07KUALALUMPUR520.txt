(SBU) We delivered reftel demarches on March 20 to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Multilateral Affairs Bureau, 
Principal Assistant Secretary for Human Rights, Ms. Astanah 
Banu Shri Abdul Aziz.  Ms. Astanah assured us the Government 
of Malaysia was watching the developments in Zimbabwe.  She 
commented that, consistent with Malaysia's general practice 
of non-interference, it was unlikely the GOM would issue a 
statement condemning Zimbabwe's actions, and even less likely 
that Malaysia would make any effort to raise the issue before 
the UN Human Rights Council.
