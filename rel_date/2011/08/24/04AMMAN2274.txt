REF:  STATE 64469 
 
¶1.  Post welcomes the opportunity to host one of the 
PMO events in Amman on April 25, 2004. 
 
¶2.  Point of contact will be Senior Commercial Officer: 
Laurie Farris, laurie.farris@mail.doc.gov, or 
farrisla@state.gov, 962-6-590-6629.   LFarris will also 
be working closely with James Sosnicky of the Iraq 
Development Center staff here in Embassy Amman, as well 
as the Econ and PA sections. 
 
¶3.  Post has arranged with the local AmCham, the 
Jordanian American Business Association (JABA) to be 
the host organization and has begun organizational 
discussions.  We intend to allow JABA to charge for 
participation in order to cover expenses of venue, etc. 
 
¶4.  The event will be billed as a workshop for 
subcontractors, with the bulk of the time devoted to 
breakout sessions.  Post will work with PMO to identify 
who from their staff will be participating, and 
identify the prime contractor participants. 
 
¶5.  Post intends to invite Iraqi business people to the 
event to enhance the networking opportunities, since 
Iraqi content is an important element of successful 
bidding.  This has been a successful feature of other 
Iraq Reconstruction events held in Amman.  Please 
inform if this is an issue. 
 
¶6.  We will work closely with Public Affairs section to 
coordinate a comprehensive media strategy targeting 
Jordanian and regional media. 
 
¶7.  Post will coordinate with FCS sections and State 
Econ/Cml sections in the region to encourage regional 
participation.
