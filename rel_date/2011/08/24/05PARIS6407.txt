DG/13/05/46 
16 September 2005 
Dear Ambassador: 
I write in reference to your letter of 28 June 2005 
concerning procedures to prevent contractual or financial 
relationships between UN organizations and terrorists and 
terrorist organizations.  I agree with you that this is a 
most important issue and I wish to assure you that I am 
carefully examining the present situation and practices at 
UNESCO. 
 
I have requested the Comptroller to ensure that there has 
not been and there will be no contractual or other financial 
relationship or engagement with individuals and 
organizations considered to be involved in terrorist 
activities as specified in the list maintained by the UN 
Security Council Committee established pursuant to 
Resolution 1267 (1999). 
 
The Comptroller will take the necessary measures to see to 
it that all Executive Offices and Administrative Officers at 
Headquarters and Administrative Officers in Field Offices 
will be required to examine requests for contracts and 
financial transactions against the UN 1267 list. 
Furthermore, he will identified on the list have been 
entered into since 1999.  Similarly, it will henceforth be a 
requirement for the Contracts Committee to obtain assurances 
from the contracting units in a systematic manner that there 
will be no contractual or financial relationship with 
individuals and/or organizations designated as terrorist 
pursuant to UN 1267. 
 
I trust that you find this information satisfactory.  Please 
be assured that I will inform you of any pertinent 
information  that may arise in this context.  I understand 
that the UN system administrative organs are currently 
discussing how best to deal with this important issue and 
coordinate their efforts. 
Yours sincerely, 
Koichiro Matsuura.
