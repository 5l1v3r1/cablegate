SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  It is common practice among politicians to make promises 
they cannot keep.  Critics are complaining that this has 
become an art form in Senegal, where in the past couple of 
weeks, a rash of groups have complained publicly about money 
they were promised by the Government but never received.  The 
consequences of such complaints, up to and including possible 
prosecution, can vary depending on how much money is being 
demanded.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE CENA'S MONEY 
---------------- 
¶2.  The National Autonomous Election Commission (CENA), the 
body responsible for oversight of the elections, has used the 
press to complain about its lack of funds for months.  While 
it was promised a budget of 800 million CFA francs (CFAF) 
(USD 1.6 million) and 52 vehicles to conduct its work, much 
of the money was never released to CENA.  On March 3, the 
CENA took the unprecedented step of issuing a communique to 
the media saying they had received no vehicles from the 
Government, and this threatened the voter registration 
process.  The communique resulted in the Government offering 
CENA ten vehicles and telling CENA it could borrow others 
from the Interior Ministry.  Still unsatisfied, CENA members 
have continued to push their case and have looked to other 
donors for support.  The Interior Ministry responded strongly 
to their continued complaints via its own communique (issued 
April 8), saying it "regretted and deplored" CENA's attitude. 
 
THE RELIGIOUS FAMILY'S MONEY 
---------------------------- 
¶3.  Just a few days before their press conference, Tidjiane 
spokesperson Abdoul Aziz Sy Junior said Tidjianes were very 
put off by an announcement made by President Wade earlier in 
the day.  Wade said three billion CFAF (USD six million) had 
been invested in Tivaouane to help the city prepare for the 
Gamou celebrating Maouloud, the Prophet Mohammad's birthday. 
The spokesperson told the daily "Walfadjri," "Tivaouane does 
not know where these three billion CFA went." 
 
THE ZIGUINCHOR LADIES' MONEY 
---------------------------- 
¶4.  During Mouammar Qadhafi's visit to Senegal to help 
celebrate its Independence Day last week, thousands of people 
were bussed into Dakar to greet the Libyan leader (Ref B). 
Of those thousands, 340 women from a section of the PDS in 
Ziguinchor were reportedly promised three million CFAF (USD 
6,000) by the presidency to participate in a massive 
gathering coordinated by Family Minister Aida Mbodj.  When 
they did not receive the money upon their return to 
Ziguinchor, they held a press conference to ask what happened 
to it. 
 
THE PUBLIC'S MONEY? 
------------------- 
¶5.  In the most contentious example of people asking what 
happened to their money, Ibrahima Sene, member of the Central 
Committee for the Labor Party (PIT) was arrested, charged 
with dissemination of false information, and abruptly 
released after he held a press conference during which he 
pondered the fate of 440 billion CFAF (USD 800 million) he 
claimed were inexplicably moved from Senegal to other 
countries from January to October 2005 (Ref A).  Sene was 
released, but PIT Secretary General Amath Dansokho, Wade's 
key coalition organiser in the 2000 campaign who is now 
playing the same role for the anti-Wade coalition, was then 
targeted.  Dansokho was summoned to the Criminal 
Investigation Division after Sene's release and interrogated 
about the same issue.  The next day, he was asked to return 
for more questioning, but he refused.  His supporters 
threatened to physically repel any attempts to take him in 
for more interrogation.  Though charges levied against 
Dansokho were dropped immediately after Dansokho's refusal, 
he was asked by the judge in the case to appear before him on 
April 18 to answer still more questions regarding the matter. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶6.  The examples above range from a relatively small pot of 
money meant to pay for transportation to a celebration to the 
large sum allegedly inappropriately removed from Senegal. 
The question remains the same, however:  What happened to the 
money?  While the GOS seemed willing to entertain (if not 
answer) such a question from the Ziguinchor ladies, it 
reacted angrily to CENA and filed criminal charges against 
PIT's leaders.  Apparently, the higher the amount in 
question, the higher the stakes.  END COMMENT.
