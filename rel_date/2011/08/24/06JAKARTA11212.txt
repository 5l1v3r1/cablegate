¶1. (SBU) Summary. The Singaporean Embassy in Jakarta has proposed 
to hold a joint planning meeting for the Tangerang trilateral 
project on September 13.  The Government of Singapore (GOS) plans 
to station permanent technical staff to head up project.  The 
Ministry of Health (MOH) is evaluating the mass Tamiflu 
prophylaxis provided to Garut local residents during a mid-August 
AI outbreak. USDA plans a series of workshops on bird wet markets 
in Tangerang on September 18, 19, and 29.  NAMRU-2 confirms two 
human cases (one fatal) of AI since Reftel A.  As of September 8, 
data from NAMRU-2 and the Ministry of Health (MOH) show 65 human 
AI cases in Indonesia with 49 fatalities. End Summary. 
 
Tangerang Trilateral Project Update 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) We met Singaporean Deputy Chief of Mission Lim Hong Huai 
Lim on September 7 to discuss implementation of the Tangerang 
Trilateral Project.  Recognizing that GOI officials were not 
likely to take the initiative on the project without some 
prodding, Lim told us he has called for a joint planning meeting 
for September 13.  He added that the Singapore Ministry of Health 
would assign a permanent technical staff member to implement the 
Tangerang project, and that additional technical staff would 
likely travel from Singapore for short assignments to assist on 
individual activities.  Lim provided a GANT chart listing project 
implementation over a three-year span and requested USG comments. 
We agreed to support Singapore's request that the GOI designate a 
Tangerang project lead, name individuals to staff the working 
groups, and commit to a timetable of activities at the September 
13 meeting.  We also provided Lim with a summary of current and 
planned USG contributions in Tangerang. 
 
MOH and WHO Collaborate on Evaluation of Tamiflu Prophylaxis 
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The MOH, with WHO support, is evaluating the mass Tamiflu 
prophylaxis provided to Garut local residents in mid-August. 
Local health authorities working with the MOH distributed 2,900 
prophylactic courses of tamiflu to villagers at the time of the 
outbreak.  Researchers will survey households for coverage, 
compliance and adverse effects as well as analyze the decision 
making process for the actions taken in Garut. 
 
USDA Sponsors Wet Market Bird Seminar 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) USDA will sponsor a series of workshops covering 
biosecurity and disease surveillance in wet markets in Tangerang 
municipality on September 18, 19, and 29.  Seminar organizers 
will run a plenary session for an audience of sixty participants, 
targeting government and industry officials.  There will also be 
multiple smaller workshops for poultry producers, slaughterhouse 
operators, and government workers.  Speakers from national and 
international human and animal health organizations will discuss 
factors that influence the presence of H5N1 and HPAI at the 
market level.

NAMRU-2 Human AI Case Profile 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) NAMRU-2 has confirmed two new cases since we transmitted 
Ref A.  The first, a 26 year-old male from Padang, Sumatra, is 
the brother of a 14 year-old female confirmed to have been 
infected with an H5N1 virus in May.  The 14 year-old female 
became ill after taking care of the bodies of two other family 
members who developed signs of H5N1 infection following area 
poultry deaths and passed away prior to sampling.  NAMRU-2 and 
MOH officials took samples from the 26-year-old male during the 
resulting investigation.  NAMRU-2 and US Centers for Disease 
Control confirmed H5N1 exposure via a four-fold rise in antibody 
titers against the H5N1 virus.  While never hospitalized, the 
victim experienced a mild febrile illness.  Both he and his 
sister recovered.  NAMRU-2 and NIHRD also confirmed a second 
case, a 14-year-old female from Makassar, Sulawesi, as H5N1 
positive on September 4.  Local officials obtained samples on 24 
June and sent them to the NIHRD laboratory for testing weeks 
later.  According to contacts, the NIHRD delayed testing the 
sample due to possible backlog.  NIHRD shared the sample with 
NAMRU-2 and performed tests on September 4.  Both laboratories 
confirmed the presence of H5N1. 
 
¶6. (SBU) NAMRU-2 data indicates the following AI-related case 
profile as of September 8: 
 
-- Number of laboratory confirmed (positive PCR and/or serology) 
human AI cases: 65, of which 49 have been fatal (case fatality 
rate of 75 percent). 
 
-- Number of probable AI cases 2, with 1 death (fatality rate of 
50 percent). 
 
-- Number of cases awaiting sequencing at the U.S. CDC: 1. 
 
-- Number of possible untested AI cases under investigation (last 
30 days): approximately 28. 
 
Note: NAMRU-2 data corresponds with MOH data but may vary at 
times with AI case figures presented on the official World Health 
Organization (WHO) website, which usually lags NAMRU-2 data by 
one week.  The WHO website, last updated on August 23, notes 60 
human AI cases in Indonesia with 46 deaths.  WHO figures can be 
accessed at www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza.
