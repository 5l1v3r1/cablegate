SUBJECT: UN SECURITY COUNCIL INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS ON 
IRAN, APRIL 28 
 
Mission may draw on the following points in UNSC 
Consultations on Iran April 28: 
 
With respect to the letter of April 18 before the committee, 
we appreciate the International Atomic Energy Agency,s 
letter and we are reviewing it. 
 
We note that the international community faces multiple 
challenges with respect to Iran and non-proliferation. 
 
The Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister stated on April 24 that 
the Malaysian government had terminated the participation of 
four Iranian companies in a Defense Expo in Kuala Lumpur 
after some of the companies displayed equipment, including 
missiles and missile systems, the transfer of which from Iran 
is a violation of UN Security Council resolution 1747. 
 
We appreciate Malaysia,s actions.  This event underscores 
Iran,s efforts to defy the UNSC and the UNSCR-mandated 
obligations.  We must all continue to implement our UNSC 
obligations robustly to maintain the pressure on Iran to 
change from its confrontational course. 
 
We also note press reports that Iran has again agreed to 
discuss the issue of its past work to develop a nuclear 
warhead with the IAEA. 
 
Such a discussion could be a positive step forward, but only 
if Iran undertakes to make a full disclosure to the IAEA of 
any nuclear weapons-related work, to address all of the 
IAEA,s serious concerns in that regard, and facilitates IAEA 
verification that any such work has ceased. 
 
However, Iran has consistently failed to answer the IAEA,s 
questions beyond calling them 
&baseless allegations8 drawn from &fabricated8 documents. 
 
The United States, objective remains a diplomatic resolution 
to this issue.  This will require Iran restoring 
international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature 
of its nuclear program.  To do so, Iran must fully and 
verifiably suspend its uranium enrichment-related, 
reprocessing, and heavy water-related activities, and 
cooperate fully with the IAEA, as required by the UN Security 
Council.
