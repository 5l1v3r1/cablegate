Communique of the International Contact Group on Somalia 
 
The International Contact Group on Somalia met on January 5, 
2007 to coordinate international efforts to foster stability, 
security, and reconciliation in Somalia.  There is an 
historic opportunity for the Somali people to reach 
sustainable political solutions for Somalia based on the 
framework of the Transitional Federal Charter.  The Contact 
Group confirms its readiness to provide immediate support for 
the stabilization of Somalia based on United Nations Security 
Council (UNSC) Resolution 1725, the effective functioning of 
the Transitional Federal Institutions, and to provide 
immediate humanitarian and development assistance. 
 
The Contact Group welcomes the commitment of President 
Abdullahi Yusuf to inclusive governance and his determination 
to prevent a resurgence of warlordism made at today's 
meeting.  The Contact Group believes that, if international 
support is to be effective, it is essential that an inclusive 
process of political dialogue and reconciliation - embracing 
representative clan, religious, business, civil society, 
women's, and other political groups who reject violence and 
extremism - be launched without delay.  In particular, the 
Contact Group further believes the move of the Transitional 
Federal Institutions to Mogadishu and the establishment of a 
representative local administration in the capital will be 
important milestones. 
 
The Contact Group emphasized the urgent need for funding to 
facilitate the deployment of a stabilization force in Somalia 
based on UNSC Resolution 1725.  The Contact Group welcomes 
Uganda's offer to deploy forces to Somalia as part of this 
stabilization force and the upcoming mission of the Foreign 
Minister of Kenya, on behalf of the Intergovernmental 
Authority on Development (IGAD), to explore additional troop 
contributions.  To establish local-level stability throughout 
Somalia, effective Somali security forces, including a 
civilian police force, must be quickly developed.  The 
Contact Group notes the important role of the United Nations 
in facilitating longer-term reconstruction and stabilization 
in Somalia. 
 
As a demonstration of solidarity with the Somali people, the 
Contact Group reaffirmed its commitment to continued 
provision of humanitarian assistance.  The Contact Group 
urges the international community to provide immediate 
concrete assistance for the Transitional Federal Institutions 
to strengthen the key institutions of governance, including 
in the security sector, in their efforts to implement the 
Transitional Federal Charter.  The Contact Group appreciates 
the key role played by non-governmental organizations and 
civil society.  The Contact Group also welcomed the emerging 
Reconstruction and Development Framework and agreed that a 
donor's conference should be convened in due course to 
respond to that framework. 
 
The Contact Group appreciates the constructive role of Kenya 
as chair of IGAD, as well as the Arab League and the African 
Union, in promoting and supporting the peace and 
reconciliation process in Somalia.  The Contact Group agreed 
to convene its next meeting in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
