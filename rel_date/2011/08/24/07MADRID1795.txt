SUBJECT: SPANISH MUSLIM LEADER'S 9-11 MESSAGE 
 
Riay Tatary, President of the Union of Spanish Islamic 
Communities (UCIDE), issued a statement on September 10 
condemning terrorism to commemorate the 6th anniversary of 
the September 11 attacks.  As the head of UCIDE, Tatary 
represents what is the most organized of a variety of 
somewhat poorly organized Islamic associations in Spain. 
UCIDE was also the group behind the creation and publication 
of the first Spanish textbook on Islam for use in Spanish 
schools.  Text of the statement follows. 
 
BEGIN TEXT OF STATEMENT: 
 
Six years after that Black Tuesday 
Written by UCIDE 
Madrid, September 10, 2007 
 
Several years having passed since the terrible attack of 
9/11, which moved the entire world, today we reiterate anew 
that terrorism and its criminal acts against the civil 
population are expressly against the Islamic creed and that 
we must fight against these actors and ideologues in order to 
eradicate their expansion, which corrupts the hearts and 
minds of people all over the world, increases suffering of 
innocent victims, and generates more hatred. 
 
Both the Koran and the Sunna (the only sources of Islam) 
prohibit and reject the very grave sin of killing another 
human being.  The commission of such a transgression is 
equated with and compared to genocide and crimes against 
humanity. 
 
We are all united in this pain, and we condemn all terrorist 
acts - whatever the armed band, whatever the ideology, 
without allowance for the use of demagogical terrorist 
discourse as a pretext for discrimination against wide 
sectors of the population. 
 
In this, we want to reiterate our gratitude to all the people 
of Spain who, despite suffering the horrors of terrorist 
violence, have had the wisdom to discern and differentiate 
clearly that these terrorist attacks against civilians 
originate from a minority with inexplicable hatreds that have 
nothing to do with the whole of the national and 
international Muslim community, nor with the Islamic 
religion, and that all of these terrorist acts are against 
the law of God, for which reason we must always condemn them 
and work together to stop the violence at its very source. 
END TEXT. 
AGUIRRE
