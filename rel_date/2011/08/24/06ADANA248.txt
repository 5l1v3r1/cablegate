HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
  EVRENSEL:     Mersin Women's Platform sent postcards to the women 
in jails as a gesture to mark the November 25 International Day

girl in Van, who is a relative of the 15-year-old girl killed in 
the name of honor because of her pregnancy out of an

ZAMAN:  Police caught the fourth suspect in connection with 
the killing of the Mayor (from AKP) and his brother in Adana's 
Karatas district on September 22.  It is found out that four

tourism area.
