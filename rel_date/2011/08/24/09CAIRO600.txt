¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Working with the Canadian Embassy in Cairo, the 
Fraud Prevention Unit (FPU) has identified at least five cases from 
the Canadians that fit the profile of the confirmed baby trafficking 
cases described in reftels. In addition, the FPU has uncovered one 
additional case from the nonimmigrant visa (NIV) unit of an elderly 
couple attempting to travel to the United Qtes with a three year 
old they claimed was their natural son, but who turned out not to be 
related. Finally, the uncovering of the baby trafficking network has 
heightened the awareness of Egyptian authorities at the various 
heath offices with regards to attempts to acquire birth certificates 
with bogus letters from medical doctors. 
 
The Canadian List 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Migration Integrity Officer (MIO) at the Canadian 
Embassy in Cairo reviewed 1000 cases of individuals who applied for 
a Canadian passport and/or Canadian Citizenship Card for their 
respective newborns during the past five years.  From that list the 
MIO identified 98 possible cases that fit the profile and 
information developed by the FPU.  The Fraud Prevention Manager 
(FPM) and A/RSO-I reviewed the cases and determined that there was a 
high probability that at least five were connected to the same baby 
trafficking network.  For example, in one case, a 54 year old woman 
applied for a Canadian passport for a child she claimed was her 
first after 16 years of marriage.  In another case, a 60 year old 
man and a 48 year old woman applied for a Canadian passport for a 
newborn they claimed was their first after 15 years of marriage. In 
other cases, the name of the doctor who delivered the baby was the 
same name of the one who has been arrested by Egyptian authorities 
for his involvement in selling newborns. 
 
The NIV case 
-------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) An alert visa line officer referred a case to FPU of a 49 
year old woman and a 77 year old man who was applying for tourist 
visas along with a three year old boy they claimed was their first 
and only natural born son.  About two years ago the couple had been 
refused visas and subsequently traveled to Spain with their alleged 
six month old newborn.  Questioning of the couple by the FPM and 
A/RSO-I yielded emphatic denials that they were not the natural 
parents of the child. Further questioning by Egyptian State Security 
Investigative Services produced the same results.  However, DNA 
testing ordered by the prosecutor confirmed that the boy could not 
be the natural son of the elderly couple. This particular case is 
the first one that the FPM and A/RSO-I have found where neither 
alleged parent was an American citizen. 
 
The Impact 
---------- 
¶4. (SBU) As a result of the uncovering of the baby trafficking 
network the MIO confirmed that the Canadian Embassy now routinely 
requests supplementary medical documentation in citizenship cases. 
Previously, Canadian passports and Citizenship Cards were being 
issued based only on the presentation of a genuine local birth 
certificate by the Canadian parent. The MIO also mentioned that DNA 
testing is now considered an option in confirming relationships in 
suspect cases. Finally, some local health offices have become very 
careful about issuing birth certificates to Egyptian American 
couples in particular. Local and international news media continue 
to follow the case and there may be more substantial impact on local 
rules and regulations regarding the issuance of birth certificates 
and/or passports.
