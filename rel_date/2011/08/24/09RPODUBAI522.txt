 -  Iraq Environment Minister Doesn't Want Nearby Nuclear Sites 
 
-   Majlis'er Says Enemies Want Iran to Withdraw from NPT 
 
-   Salehi: We Need 20 Enrichment Sites, Won't Withdraw From NPT 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) IRAQ ENVIRONMENT MINISTER DOESN'T WANT NEARBY IRANIAN 
NUCLEAR SITES 
 
 
 
A December 16 'Baztab' piece compiled from an 'Al-Zaman' article 
says that Iraqi Environment Minister Narmeen Osman has said that: 
 
 
 
- if Iran sets up enrichment facilities within 70 kilometers of 
the Iraqi border, Iraq will "react appropriately." 
 
 
 
- She said Iraq has asked the IAEA to give it more information 
about the issue [Iran's enrichment facilities] so that Iraq 
knows what it has to do. 
 
 
 
- Iraq has put systems in Baghdad and Basra that measure atomic 
radiation from 'neighboring countries,' and if Iraq senses 
danger in this regard it will give the necessary warnings and 
take the necessary actions to protect Iraq's environment and its 
people. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) MAJLIS'ER SAYS ENEMIES WANT IRAN TO WITHDRAW FROM NPT 
 
 
 
On December 6 Iranian press quoted Majlis National Security 
Committee member Heshmat Fallahat Pisheh as saying that: 
 
 
 
- Iran's withdrawing from the NPT would be a step in a direction 
towards which Iran's enemies wish Iran to head. 
 
 
 
- Cooperation with the IAEA will prove the righteousness of 
Iran's nuclear program and Iran cannot destroy of proof of this 
cooperation by withdrawing from the NPT. 
 
 
 
- By stipulating a new deadline, the US has put Iran in a 
complicated position.  Iran's goal in its nuclear program is to 
get needed fuel for the TRR and its other reactors, but America 
and Europe haven't given the necessary guarantees re providing 
this fuel. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U) SALEHI: WE NEED 20 ENRICHMENT SITES, WON'T WITHDRAW FROM 
NPT AS WEST WISHES 
 
 
 
In a December 4th interview with PressTV, AEOI head Salehi said: 
 
 
 
- We are in need of 20 thousands megawatts that means 20 [times 
the amount the] Natanz [facility can produce]," 
 
 
 
 
DUBAI 00000522  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
- "Now the government has decided to have ten sites with the 
same size as Natanz; of course when I say with the same size as 
Natanz it is concerning the amount of fuel that is produced and 
it is about thirty tonnes per year. Every site will be producing 
thirty tonnes per year which is enough for one nuclear power 
plant." 
 
- Salehi added that Tehran will not pull out of the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). "I think the West is trying to 
force us out of the NPT because they have noticed that we are 
insistent about~heeding the NPT and this is not to the liking of 
the West."
