¶1. (SBU) Egyptian blogger Abdel Karim Nabil Soliman was found 
guilty and sentenced to a total of four years in prison on 
February 22 at an Alexandria court hearing.  He received a 
3-year sentence for "inciting hatred of Islam and insulting 
the Prophet Mohamed," and 1-year sentence for "defaming the 
President of the Republic."  His lawyers tell us they plan to 
appeal the decision to a higher court, and that they will 
file the initial appeal paperwork on February 25.  According 
to reports in the Egyptian press, Abdel Karim's father has 
publicly disowned his son, criticizing him for "imitating the 
West," and disparaging civil society and human rights 
associations "who are trying to acquit my son, as they are 
trying to pressure the court."  Background on the case 
reported reftel. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We recommend the following press guidance, to be 
used on an only if asked basis: 
 
-- We are extremely concerned by the conviction and 
sentencing to imprisonment of Mr. Abdel Karim for expressing 
his opinions. 
 
-- We do not follow the blog.  Some of the content may indeed 
be offensive.  We do not endorse or condone offensive 
content.  However, the role of freedom of expression is 
critical in a democratic and prosperous society.
