Honorable President of United States of America 
 
Respectful president Barak Obama 
Best Greetings 
 
Allow me, honorable president, to express my appreciation, 
thankfulness and admiration for your wise decision to extend the 
presidential decision order to protect Iraqi funds, which was set to 
expire on May 22, 2009, for an additional year. 
Honorable president, your positive decision will result in providing 
peace and stability for the federal democratic Iraqi territory, to 
which the U.S. government and people have provided complete support. 
 This will lead to protecting Iraqi money to direct these funds for 
reconstruction, providing essential services, raising the living 
conditions, and providing for the welfare of the Iraqi people. 
 
Accept our respect for your esteemed office.

Baqer Jaber Al Zubaydi
