Â¶1. (SBU) CG raised reftel points February 25 with Andorran FM 
Mateu.  Mateu noted that Andorra agreed with the U.S. position 
and supported efforts to protect civil and human rights in Cuba 
as well as promote democratic principles on the island.  Mateu 
said the GOA was not likely to issue  a statement on the change 
of government, but would continue to work with the USG and other 
European countries on helping to realize a democratic Cuba.
