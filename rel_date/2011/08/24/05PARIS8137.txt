¶1.  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Bolivia Desk Officer 
Philippe Letrillard on November 30.  Letrillard underlined 
that the GoF fully supported efforts to ensure free, fair, 
and transparent elections in Bolivia.  However, he noted that 
the EU was unable to send observers and expressed doubt that 
France would be able to provide bilateral monitors.  He cited 
a lack of available personnel due, in part, to the French 
contribution to the EU observer mission for the Venezuelan 
elections.  Letrillard was unaware of any French NGOs 
planning to participate, but indicated he would contact the 
French Embassy in La Paz to see if it knew of any interested 
NGOs that could be given the contact information for 
volunteers.  Letrillard promised to contact Poloff if the 
French position changed or if any NGOs were identified who 
would like to participate. 
 
¶2.  Poloff contacted the Bolivian Embassy in Paris to inform 
them of the demarche, but was unable to coordinate a joint 
demarche in the time available.
