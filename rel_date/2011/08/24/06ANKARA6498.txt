In Today's Papers 
 
 
Pope Benedict XVI's Upcoming Visit to Turkey 
Yeni Safak, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others:  Turkey 
plans tight security measures for the Pope for his upcoming visit to 
Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir.  Ali Bardakoglu, head of the directorate 
for Religious Affairs, said that the Pope should "acknowledge the 
peaceful nature of Islam" during his visit to Turkey, and should 
stress that "religion is not the source of violence."  Meanwhile, 
the Felicity Party (SP) is organizing a "No to the Pope" 
demonstration on Sunday in Istanbul.  The Vatican yesterday 
expressed great disappointment at an ultranationalist protest 
against the Pope in Istanbul's Hagia Sophia.  Turkish Culture 
Minister Atilla Koc also condemned the protest saying that he "could 
not approve of a raid on a cultural center or a place of worship, 
regardless the reason." 
 
World Economic Forum (WEF) 
All papers:  Stressing the importance of connecting regions and 
creating new opportunities in his opening speech at the WEF Turkey 
Summit, PM Erdogan said "Turkey has come to be known in the 
international community as the country of opportunities." He 
stressed that the Forum would determine problems and would suggest 
solutions in this framework.  PM Erdogan noted that Turkey's EU 
entry was crucial for the alliance of civilizations.  A report 
prepared by the WEF described Turkey as model of stability in the 
region and that Turkey was playing active role in preventing 
regional clashes and defusing tensions. 
 
Journalists, Jurists Proposal to Amend Article 301 
Sabah, Zaman and others:  The Turkish Journalists Society and the 
Turkish Penal Code (TPC) Association sent PM Erdogan a proposal 
regarding amendment of Turkish Penal Code, article 301, the article 
under which several prominent journalists and writers have been 
prosecuted for "insulting Turkishness."  According to the proposal, 
the word "Turkishness" in the controversial article 301 of the TCK 
should be replaced with the term "Turkish Nation" to underline 
citizenship bonds. 
 
President Sezer Remarks at the OIC 
All papers:  Speaking at the Standing Committee for Economic and 
Commercial Cooperation of the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
(OIC COMCEC), President Sezer urged the international community to 
end the unjust isolation of Turkish Cypriots.  President Sezer 
expressed Turkey's concerns over Iraq and noted that rather than a 
referendum, Kirkuk's status should be determined through 
compromise.
