Â¶1.  (SBU)  Pol/Econ chief September 21 delivered reftel 
talking points, non-paper, and OIC resolutions regarding the 
Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI) to MFA Director for 
Bilateral Affairs Dhafer Al-Umran.  Al-Umran understood the 
connection between the PEI and the Organization of Islamic 
Conferences, but said that Bahrain, unlike many of the other 
members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, had limited 
financial resources and was unable to provide funding for the 
WHO/UNICEF polio eradication initiative.  He noted, however, 
that Rotary International had taken on polio eradication as a 
global community service project.  As a member of the Rotary 
in Bahrain, he said he would raise the issue at the next 
meeting to see if the Rotary in Bahrain might be able to 
assist in some way.
