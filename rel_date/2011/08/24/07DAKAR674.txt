FORUM 
 
¶1.  (U) On March 22, Ambassador Claude Absa Diallo, the Acting 
Foreign Minister, convoked the DCM (then Charge) to present a March 
8 letter from President Abdoulaye Wade to President George W. Bush 
seeking membership in the International Biofuels Forum that was 
launched in New York on March 2.  An unofficial embassy translation 
follows. 
 
Begin text. 
 
Republic of Senegal 
Presidency of the Republic 
March 8, 2007 
 
Dear Mr. President, 
 
I noted with interest the March 2 launching in New York of the 
International Biofuels Forum, which is designed to encourage the use 
of ethanol and biodiesel. 
 
I salute this happy initiative of which your country is one of the 
principal promoters. 
 
Because of the numerous problems linked to the unbridled 
exploitation of petroleum, turning to biofuels would be a welcome 
alternative both for the world environment and for our economies. 
 
That explains why Senegal, which has launched its own major biofuels 
program, would like to reinforce the initiative launched in New York 
by becoming a member of the International Biofuels Forum. 
 
I am counting on your support for Senegal's candidacy. 
 
Please accept, Mr. President, my best wishes. 
 
Abdoulaye Wade 
President of the Republic of Senegal. 
 
His Excellency George W. Bush 
President of the United States of America 
Washington 
 
End text of unofficial translation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COMMENT: The Acting Foreign Minister told DCM that Brazil, 
China, India, South Africa and the European Union are part of the 
Forum.  She also said President Wade is extremely interested in this 
initiative and in energy issues in general, as evidenced by the Wade 
Formula.  END COMMENT.
