¶1.  Per reftel instructions, on May 14, EconOff delivered 
information on U.S. proposals for CITES COP 14 to Colonel Matar 
Cisse, Director of the Forestry and Water Department at the Ministry 
of Environment, and Abdoulaye Sy, Head of the Fauna Division.  Mr. 
Sy is the GOS's senior expert on CITES issues and he will represent 
Senegal at the June 3-15 CITES COP in The Hague.  Sy mentioned that 
he would participate in an Africa Group meeting prior to the start 
of the COP with the goal of harmonizing the positions of Kenya, 
South Africa and Botswana on the elephant and black rhino 
proposals. 
 
¶2.  In response to the U.S. proposals, Mr. Sy noted that there were 
no obvious concerns for Senegal, but that he was not yet prepared to 
offer an official response.  Particularly on the marine proposals, 
including those put forth by Germany/the EU, Sy explained that he 
would be doing additional internal consultations with the Fisheries 
Division to assess the possible impact of new fish listings.
