¶1. (U) This is an action message.  Please see para 8. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 24, Econoff met with Nouredine Moujahid, Chief of 
Staff for International Cooperation, Ministry of Interior, to 
discuss new dates for a consultation visit to Washington by Moroccan 
border security officials.  Moujahid proposed that the visit occur 
from April 5-12, but that it be split into two, with two separate 
agendas, both headed by Governor Khalid Zerouali, the Interior 
Ministry's Director for Migration and Border Security Issues.  The 
first delegation would like to focus on crisis management, with 
visits to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the 
National Targeting Center.  The second delegation would focus on 
seaport security and requests a visit to the Port of Baltimore. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Moujahid said Morocco was interested in establishing a 
national command facility that could respond to both natural 
disasters and terrorist/security incidents.  He requested a tailored 
program for 6 officials 7-9 April that would include consultations 
with senior FEMA officials and a visit to the National Targeting 
Center.  The delegation would arrive on Saturday and Sunday, 5-6 
April, and depart 10 April.  Moujahid named only 5 members of the 
delegation. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Delegation Members: 
Governeur-Director Khalid Zerouali, MOI. 
Colonel Mohamed Benziane, Office of Civil Protection, MOI. 
Mohamed Manchoud, Chief of Budget Division, MOI. 
Mohamed Youssef Safouane, MOI. 
Sec-Gen Mohamed Assila, Crisis Management Division, MOI. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) A second 5-member team would arrive on 9 April with a 
focus on export/import control and port security.  Governeur 
Zerouali would remain in Washington to head this delegation, with 
the other names to follow.  This group desires a visit to the Port 
of Baltimore and consultations on issues related to the Export 
Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program.  Moujahid asked 
if USG funding, specifically hotel accommodation, was available to 
help with the costs of both visits. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Econoff told Moujahid he would forward all the requests to 
Washington, reminded him that the original 26-28 February 
consultations involved no USG funding, and recommended he notify and 
coordinate the visit with the Moroccan Embassy in Washington as 
well. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment:  Zerouali, who is responsible for the security of 
Morocco's land, sea, and air frontiers is apparently being groomed 
for higher positions.  He received both A/S McNerney and Amb Swing 
(IOM) during their recent visits to Morocco.  He speaks fluent 
English and has repeatedly expressed his desire for U.S. assistance 
in the improvement of Morocco's crisis response capability, 
export/import controls, and border security.  We realize that 
arranging the proposed visit on such short notice is difficult, but 
believe it would pay dividends in further reinforcing bilateral 
cooperation with key players on critical security issues, including 
development of a dual-use national control list.  It would also 
facilitate Moroccan support for the EXBS Transshipment Conference in 
Tangier May 20-22, and improve Morocco's ability to supervise 
commerce through its new transshipment port, a strong USG interest 
given the future likelihood of a direct Tangier Med-East Coast 
shipping line.  End Comment. 
 
¶8. (U) Action request: Embassy Rabat requests Washington agencies 
offer the Moroccans a program generally in accordance with their 
proposed dates and activities, without offering USG funding 
assistance.
