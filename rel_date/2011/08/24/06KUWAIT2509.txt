¶1. An op-ed headlined "And a Purse Too," by Ahmed Mohammed Al-Fahd 
in the conservative Arabic daily Al-Watan stated, "If we were to 
calculate roughly the cost of gifts allegedly given to prospective 
women voters, we would deduce that buying purses for women is 
cheaper and better than paying money for their votes. A brand name 
purse sells wholesale for KD 500 (approximately US $1455). This is a 
justifiable practice because, first, it would be considered a gift, 
which is not different than the pens, notebooks, and umbrellas that 
we used to give away in previous elections. Second, the law does not 
yet specify that gift-giving is against the law. Third, women would 
not feel humiliated to receive these gifts, as would be the case for 
those who accept money for their votes. When these women attend 
diwaniyas at night they would carry these brand name purses with 
pride. In any case, whether or not the prosecutor charged the 
gift-giver with bribery, and whether or not those who raffled 
apartments in Lebanon are charged with dishonest conduct, the fact 
remains that women in Kuwait need election education and someone 
needs to draw their attention to the danger around them. Most 
importantly, women must not sell their votes whether the purse is a 
genuine brand name or a knock-off." 
 
¶2. Pro-government Arabic daily Al-Seyassah published the second part 
of an article by Kuwaiti writer Mr. Zubn Al-Bathal headlined "A 
Letter to Voters II." The second letter by Mr. Al-Zubn advised 
women, "Out of concern for the integrity and honesty of the election 
process and for the candidates, we must not spread rumors that we 
hear about other people. Unless we were eye witnesses to the fact, 
then we must not help spread these corruptive rumors.... Rumors are 
a dangerous social disease that have spread rapidly in our 
community. That is why we must fight back by voting for good people 
for the National Assembly." 
 
¶3. Ms. Shaykha Al-Mutairi summarized the demands of young men and 
women in a column in conservative Arabic daily Al-Watan titled, 
"Inner Strife." Ms. Al-Mutairi concluded, "Young people are looking 
for those who would work for their country with honesty, dignity, 
and self-discipline. We seek torches to light our paths. Liars, 
deceivers, and those who sold their honor should withdraw from the 
race. We need people who can point their fingers at what is wrong, 
and do something about it. We want representatives that are 
sympathetic to their constituents' needs. We are in dire need of 
those who can preserve our country and protect our future and the 
future of our children. We are experiencing a democratic wedding, so 
let us not ruin it. My comments only apply to some people, and not 
all." 
 
¶4. In his column headlined, "Even If He Were to Lead a Dissolute 
Life" Dr. Sajed Al-Abdaly, Chair of the National Committee for 
Honest Election, continued his advice on how to make the right 
choice on Election Day. Dr. Abdaly opined in the independent Arabic 
daily Al-Rai Al-Aam, "We do not need weak people in the National 
Assembly, even if they are righteous people. We want strong 
candidates, people who have foresight and sharp vision. We are 
seeking people who can fight battles against political backwardness 
and financial corruption. We should vote for strong people who would 
represent the nation, even if they were to lead a dissolute life. 
Their arrogance will backfire on them." 
 
¶5. Under the headline "Not in Defense of the Government," by 
political activist and Kuwait University political science professor 
Dr. Shamlan Yousef Al-Issa defended the government's position, "We 
must say it aloud and frankly that it is not just in order to blame 
all MPs for repeated violations, or for embezzlement of public funds 
when discussing issues of national interest at the National 
Assembly.... We have been infected with some corrupt MPs who have 
used and abused our democratic system for personal gain. This was 
possible because we lack a clear reform vision and do not act on the 
principles of a contemporary state based on legislation and 
constitutional laws. Instead we have adopted a practice of appeasing 
individuals at the expense of the country's national interest."

¶6. Progressive Arabic daily Al-Qabas published on the last page by 
Dr. Naji Saud Al-Zaid's comment, "Everybody within and outside of 
Kuwait is watching the election. That is why we wish for women's 
voting to be honest, independent, and unbiased. We expect women to 
cast their votes with the national interest of Kuwait in mind. This 
is a historic chance for women to have their say count. We 
definitely do not want women to vote based on family, sect, tribe, 
or ethnic loyalties. We have suffered enough from what men have 
brought upon us during decades past when they dragged us with them 
down that path. We want an honest and free vote. We want women's 
votes to bring us honorable MPs. We want the right people for the 
future of our children."
