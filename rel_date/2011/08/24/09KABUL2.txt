REF: SECSTATE 132539 
 
 ¶1. (U) Afghan Foreign Ministry official Dr. Jamrad Jamshed, 
Director of MFA's Fourth Political Department, responded with 
enthusiasm to the invitation to the Fifth Global Initiative 
to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) meeting in The Hague in 
June 2009.  He said the Afghan government (GIRoA) would 
probably send a senior MFA official and promised to confirm 
this expectation shortly. 
 
¶2. (U) On December 29, Political-Military Counselor Clarke, 
Netherlands DCM Renet van der Waals, and Russian Federation 
Counselor Andrey Vadov jointly demarched Dr. Jamshed, per 
reftel request. Afghan MFA officials M. Yama Aini, the 
Northern European desk officer, and A. Hakim Atarud, the 
Southern European desk officer, sat in on the meeting.  Aside 
from conveying the invitation and explaining the conference, 
the Netherlands DCM led a short general discussion on the 
importance of combating nuclear terrorism.  Dr. Jamshed 
volunteered that Afghanistan was acutely aware of the 
dangers, especially considering that it was surrounded by 
nuclear armed neighbors and located in an unstable region. He 
welcomed the invitation.  Jamshed did not commit to 
attendance at the deputy foreign minister level but expressed 
the view that a senior MFA official probably would 
participate in the GICNT conference.  He promised to provide 
confirmation and details as soon as possible.
