SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Preliminary, unofficial results from IFES, political 
party representatives, and media outlets indicate that Saad 
Hariri's March 14 coalition and pro-March 14 independents won 
the majority in the June 7 parliamentary elections with as 
many as 71 out of 128 seats.  From his Qoreitem residence, 
Hariri told supporters in the early hours of June 8 that June 
7 was "a big day in the history of democratic 
Lebanon...congratulations to you, congratulations to freedom, 
congratulations to democracy."  Representatives of the 
opposition conceded defeat without rancor but laid down 
markers about forming a "national unity" cabinet composed of 
both blocs.  A representative of opposition Christian leader 
Michel Aoun said "We accept the will of the people" but added 
that his party would work with March 14 "to form a government 
of national unity."  Hizballah MP Hassan Fadlallah called for 
a government of "national partnership."  As of 1000 hr 
(Beirut time) on June 8, Interior Minister Ziad Baroud had 
announced official results for 15 out of 26 electoral 
districts, and they track with what we heard from unofficial 
sources.  Baroud's announcements on the remaining districts 
are expected throughout the day.  End summary.
