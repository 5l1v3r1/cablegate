SUBJECT: Israel's COP-15 Accord Commitment 
 
REF: STATE 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post communicated demarche on COP-15 Accord commitments 
(reftel) to Israel's Foreign Ministry (International Organization 
Department)on January 14, and later to Environmental Protection 
Ministry (MEP).  MEP International Relations office noted that the 
GOI was still organizing itself to be able to make the commitments 
noted in the Copenhagen Accord, and doubted that it would make a 
January 31 deadline.  However, the MEP officer observed that the 
Ministry had just received notice that the UN had itself pushed the 
deadline for nations to register their association with the 
Copenhagen Accord and record their commitments into the future, so 
January 31 was no longer the operative date.  ESTOff encouraged the 
Ministry to continue to move on its association preparations, 
nonetheless, given the importance of keeping the maximum momentum 
from the Copenhagen meeting. 
 
¶2. (U) Post would appreciate Department's verification of a new 
target date for states to register their association and 
commitments, and will continue to follow the issue's progress and 
report when GOI association with the Copenhagen Accord is likely.
