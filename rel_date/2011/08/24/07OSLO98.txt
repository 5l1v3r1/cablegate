¶1.  (SBU) Deputy Pol/Econ Counselor delivered reftel points 
on Norsk Hydro's investment in Iran's Anaran oilfield on 
January 31 to Norsk Hydro Senior Vice-President Tor Steinum 
and on February 1 to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Energy 
Advisor Janne Julsrud.  Hydro's Steinum affirmed that the 
company's contractual arrangements with the Iranians called 
for delivery of a development plan for Anaran in April.  He 
added that progress on the Anaran project was generally slow, 
but Hydro was still working to meet the April contractual 
deadline for finalizing the plan.  There was a chance that 
this deadline could slip, but that would require Iranian 
consent.  Steinum indicated that his colleague, Senior VP 
Torgeir Kydland, would be prepared to discuss the company's 
activities in Iran directly with Washington interlocutors 
when he visits later this month.  (Note:  Kydland is 
traveling until next week and was unavailable for the 
meeting.  Probable timing for his trip to Washington is the 
last week of February.  End note.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU) MFA energy advisor Julsrud reiterated the GON 
position that it does not generally interfere in the 
commercial activities of state-owned or controlled companies, 
but added that the GON maintains an active dialogue with 
Hydro on a range of matters, Iran included.  She indicated 
that the GON has advised the company of the risks of doing 
business in Iran. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Neither Steinum nor Julsrud could predict how the 
proposed Statoil-Hydro merger might affect Norwegian 
petroleum investments in Iran.  Steinum said that Hydro was 
carrying on business as usual until the merger is approved 
and finalized, but he thought that Hydro's ongoing projects 
in Iran would be absorbed into the new company.
