¶1.   AN OP-ED BY AMBASSADOR JOSEPH SULLIVAN RECEIVED 
    PROMINENT PUBLICATION IN TWO INFLUENTIAL ZIMBABWEAN 
    NEWSPAPERS ON NOVEMBER 1.  THE PRIVATELY-OWNED "DAILY 
    NEWS" CARRIED THE PIECE AS THE ONLY OPINION PIECE ON 
    THEIR OP-ED PAGE.  THE PRIVATELY OWNED WEEKLY 
    "FINANCIAL GAZETTE" DEDICATED AN ENTIRE PAGE TO THE 
    ARTICLE.  TEXT OF THE OP-ED PIECE FOLLOWS. 
 
¶2. ACTING TOGETHER AGAINST TERROR 
BY JOSEPH G. SULLIVAN 
UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO ZIMBABWE 
 
TERRORISM POSES AN OVERRIDING THREAT TO INNOCENT PEOPLE 
EVERYWHERE.  AS THE LONG LIST OF NATIONS WHO LOST 
CITIZENS IN THE ATTACKS ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER 
SHOWS, TERROR'S INNOCENT VICTIMS ARE OF ALL 
NATIONALITIES, AND ALL FAITHS.  AMONG THE NATIONS 
ATTACKED IN NEW YORK WAS ZIMBABWE, TWO OF WHOSE 
CITIZENS ARE AMONG THE MORE THAN 30 AFRICANS KILLED OR 
MISSING.  TERRORISM'S EVIL AND PERVASIVE NATURE MEANS 
NO ONE CAN FEEL TRULY SAFE.  THIS IS TRUE IN ALL 
PLACES, IN ALL LANDS. 
 
ACKNOWLEDGING THIS FACT, THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS IS 
WORKING TOGETHER IN A GLOBAL EFFORT TO PROTECT THE 
SAFETY AND RIGHTS OF ALL THE WORLD'S PEOPLE.  MORE THAN 
40 COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND 
ASIA HAVE GRANTED AIR TRANSIT OR LANDING RIGHTS TO U.S. 
AND BRITISH MILITARY AIRCRAFT.  MORE COUNTRIES HAVE 
SHARED INTELLIGENCE.   MANY MORE NATIONS, INCLUDING 
ZIMBABWE, HAVE EXPRESSED OUTRAGE AT THE SEPTEMBER 11 
ATTACKS AND HAVE STATED THEIR DETERMINATION TO TAKE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HARARE  03277  01 OF 02  020557Z 
PART IN THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO COMBAT TERRORISM. 
 
THESE NATIONS UNDERSTAND, AS DO MOST ZIMBABWEANS, THAT 
THE WAR AGAINST TERROR IS NOT ABOUT THE WEST VS. ISLAM 
OR ABOUT DISAGREEMENT WITH PAST OR PRESENT AMERICAN 
FOREIGN POLICIES.  THIS IS A WAR AGAINST THE HATE- 
FILLED, UNILATERAL INTOLERANCE OF A TINY NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE AND THEIR PROTECTORS.  AS PRESIDENT BUSH PUT IT, 
"THIS IS A WAR AGAINST HATRED."  IT IS A WAR TO PROTECT 
THE RIGHTS AND DREAMS OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE 
WORLD'S PEOPLE.  IT IS A WAR TO PRESERVE FREEDOM OF 
RELIGION, THE RIGHT OF ALL PEOPLE TO EDUCATION AND 
PROFESSIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FREELY 
AND ENGAGE IN PEACEFUL DEBATE, THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL, THE 
RIGHT TO ENJOY MUSIC, THEATER, DANCE, ART AND 
LITERATURE, AND THE RIGHT TO BE FREE OF FEAR. 
 
IN RESPONSE TO THE ATTACKS ON HUMANITY THAT TOOK PLACE 
IN THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, THE UNITED STATES 
AND GREAT BRITAIN HAVE BEGUN THE MILITARY ACTIONS THAT 
FORM PART OF THE GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO DEFEAT TERRORISM. 
THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER AND THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
RECOGNIZE THESE ACTIONS AS LEGITIMATE MEASURES OF SELF- 
DEFENSE.  THEY ARE ALSO THE MOST VISIBLE PART OF A VAST 
AND UNPRECEDENTED INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO EXTEND THE 
REACH OF JUSTICE TO THOSE PLACES WHERE THE GERM OF 
TERROR HAS FESTERED. 
 
PRESIDENT BUSH'S ORDER DIRECTING MILITARY ACTION 
AGAINST THE AL-QAEDA NETWORK AND THE TALIBAN REGIME 
THAT GIVES THEM SHELTER WAS DELIBERATE AND FOCUSED IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HARARE  03277  01 OF 02  020557Z 
TIMING AND SCOPE.  ALTHOUGH THE RAGE OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE AND THE WORLD IS WELL JUSTIFIED, THE U.S. DOES 
NOT STRIKE IN ANGER AND DOES NOT TARGET INNOCENTS.  IN 
THE DAYS FOLLOWING SEPTEMBER 11, THE WORLD HAS COME TO 
REALIZE, THAT NATIONS MUST WORK TOGETHER TO DEFEAT 
TERROR.  GOVERNMENTS HAVE COME TO REALIZE THAT ACTING 
RESOLUTELY IN THE INTEREST OF COMMON GLOBAL SECURITY IS 
A MATTER OF URGENT NECESSITY.  PRESIDENT MUGABE AND 
MINISTER OF JUSTICE CHINAMASA, IN THEIR STRONG 
CONDEMNATIONS OF TERRORISM, HAVE MADE ZIMBABWE'S 
POSITION CLEAR. 
 
LEFT UNCHECKED, TERRORISM WILL AFFECT THE LIVES OF 
EVERYONE.  TERRORISTS ROB INNOCENT VICTIMS OF LIFE, AND 
ROB ALL OF US OF OUR SECURITY.  TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE 
VERY FREEDOMS THAT ARE THE HALLMARKS OF DEMOCRATIC 
SOCIETIES, TERRORISTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED COLD-BLOODED 
SKILLS OF INFILTRATION.  DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, THEY 
THREATEN OUR FREEDOM. 
 
THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRAGEDIES OF SEPTEMBER 
11 DO NOT UNDERSTAND DISCUSSION, NEGOTIATION OR

AND SAFEGUARD LIBERTY.  SADLY, THEY HAVE LEFT THE WORLD 
NO OPTION BUT TO DESTROY THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE, 
ELIMINATE THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT, BRING THEIR LEADERS 
TO JUSTICE, AND END THEIR ABILITY TO HOLD THE REST OF 
THE WORLD HOSTAGE TO THEIR MADNESS.  THAT IS WHAT THE 
CURRENT MILITARY ACTIONS, AND THE MANY OTHER EFFORTS 
NOW UNDERWAY, SEEK TO DO. 
 
PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS AND FAITHS KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL 
VULNERABLE TO TERROR, WHICH BY ITS NATURE IS CARELESS 
OF ITS TARGETS AND INDIFFERENT TO HUMAN LIFE.  SUCH 
SOLIDARITY HAS NOW TURNED TO SUPPORT OF WORLD ACTION TO 
ROOT OUT TERROR. THIS COALITION OF CONCERNED NATIONS IS 
A TRULY HISTORIC RESPONSE TO AN UNPARALLELED ATTACK AND 
CONTINUING THREAT AGAINST EVERYONE. 
 
WORKING TOGETHER WITH A SHARED SENSE OF PURPOSE WE CAN 
EXTEND THE REACH OF JUSTICE EVEN INTO THE DARKEST CAVES 
WHERE TERROR HIDES, AND MAKE OUR WORLD A SAFER PLACE.
