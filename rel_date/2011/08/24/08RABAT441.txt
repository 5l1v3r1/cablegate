SUBJECT: MOROCCO - INTEGRATING BORDER SECURITY TRAINING PROGRAMS 
 
REF: A. 3RD MOD TO INL-MOROCCO LOA 
     ¶B. 07 STATE 132724 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary and Introduction:  Countering terrorism remains 
Post's number one mission objective.  As such, we coordinate a 
multitude of security related events that are programmed and 
administered through a host of departments, agencies, and bureaus. 
In addition to USG programs, we have become increasingly aware of 
robust French, Spanish, and British border security related 
training, with all of us competing for space on the Moroccan 
calendar.  In order to simplify coordination within the Department 
and with Morocco, Post recommends that to the extent possible, all 
law enforcement and border security related training for Morocco be 
managed by INL through its LOA with the Moroccan government.  While 
we suggest the legislative reform and regulatory aspect of the EXBS 
program remain programmed as a separate NADR EXBS sub-appropriation, 
we believe the overall process would be improved by reprogramming 
the EXBS "border security" pillar to INL managed INCLE 
sub-appropriation.  End Summary and Introduction. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Two vital elements of our overall Mission strategy are 
programs administered through the International Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement Affairs (INL) and International Security and 
Nonproliferation (ISN) bureaus.  Individually these programs provide 
critical support to our mission strategy, but collectively they 
sometimes compete for the same Moroccan participants and are 
pressing up against Morocco's absorption capacity.  Given that their 
objectives and target audiences largely overlap, Post recommends 
that Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining and Related Projects 
(NADR) and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement 
(INCLE) funded programs be integrated into a common schedule.  Based 
on recent experience in coordinating such events, Post believes the 
events outlined in Para 8 represent a realistic schedule.  In 
addition, for future planning purposes, Post recommends no more than 
four in-country and 2 U.S.-based events, per lead Moroccan ministry, 
should be planned in any 12 month period. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) INL managed training events for Morocco are covered under 
a Letter of Agreement signed with Morocco in 2003.  The 3rd 
modification to this agreement was delivered to the Moroccan 
Ministry of Interior for coordination and approval on April 10 (Ref 
A).  It includes approximately USD 1.4 million of INCLE funded 
border security and law enforcement training events that will be 
administered by DHS, U.S. Coast Guard, and the American Bar 
Association.  Although the modification to the LOA describes the 
envisioned training events, it does not address timing or schedule. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ISN managed events for Morocco fall under the Export 
Control and Border Security (EXBS) program.  In July 2007, a U.S. 
EXBS delegation visited Morocco, resulting in a two-track strategy 
(Ref B): training and support for improved border protection; and 
legislative and regulatory reform leading to Moroccan establishment 
of a national control list for dual-use items. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Redundancy sometimes arises from the shared emphasis on 
border security and protection.  For example, in February 2008, 18 
Moroccan officials from the Ministry of Interior (MOI) attended an 
"International Seaport Interdiction Training (ISIT)" course in 
Charleston.  This outstanding course was administered through DHS 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as part of the EXBS program. 
However, its accompanying land component, "International Border 
Interdiction Training (IBIT)" is programmed under the INL LOA, and 
both courses are taught by the same pool of DHS instructors and are 
coordinated through the same Moroccan office in the MOI. 
Additionally, while the ISIT course was underway in Charleston, an 
INL programmed "Train the Trainer" course was conducted in Rabat. 
Both courses targeted the same level and type of official, strained 
the ability of Moroccan customs and border security to identify 
participants, and appeared to overwhelm the Moroccan office that 
coordinated them both. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Currently, all border security related training for 
Morocco comes under the purview of the Office of Migration and 
Border Security, MOI.  Whether it is vessel boarding training 
managed through the Office of Security Cooperation (OSC), 
International Seaport Interdiction Training (ISIT) managed through 
EXBS, or International Border Interdiction Training (IBIT) managed 
through INL; Post coordinates all border security training with the 
same Moroccan official, Governor-Director Zerouali.  Zerouali's 
staff support is limited, and our experience has been that the 
office cannot coordinate simultaneous events or arrange events with 
less than two months notice.  The February 2008 ISIT course, for 
example, was originally scheduled to occur in December 2007, but had 
to be postponed because "inter-ministerial" coordination of 
participants was not completed in time.  In short, the myriad of 
U.S. programs aimed at improving Morocco's border security is beyond 
this office in the MOI's ability to absorb. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Additionally, little has been accomplished working through 
this same office in the MOI on the second pillar of the EXBS 
program: legislative and regulatory reform that would lead to the 
establishment of a national control list for dual-use items.  For 
this reason, we suggest reaching out to the Ministry of External 
Commerce towards this end.  This Ministry's profile has recently 
been significantly raised and now appears to have a leading role in 
the formation of trade policy. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Post suggests the following schedule of customs and border 
security related training (NADR and INCLE funded) events for the
