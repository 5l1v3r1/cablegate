SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On March 20, the Government of National Unity (GNU) 
Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) Office in Nyala, South Darfur, 
publicly posted the results of an evaluation report ranking local 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) at the Nyala HAC office. 
According to U.N. Civil Affairs, a total of 109 NGOs were singled 
out for further evaluation, restructuring, or dismissal, including 
19 USAID partners.  USAID and the U.N. Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) along with affected NGOs are seeking 
greater clarification of the impact and ramification of the HAC 
categorizations on humanitarian programs in the region.  End 
Summary.

HAC RANKS and DISMISSES LOCAL NGOS 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On March 20, the HAC office in Nyala publicly posted a 
report titled, "Final Evaluation of the Committee," in which local 
organizations were ranked as 'perfect, middle, weak, or dismissed,' 
according to the HAC's evaluation of the quality of NGO activities 
provided to internally displaced persons (IDPs), civilians, and 
voluntary returns.  In total, 58 NGOs were 'dismissed' and an 
additional 48 NGOs were singled out for further evaluation or 
restructuring, including 19 current or past USAID partners. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The list identified two USAID partners as 'dismissed.' 
The only explanation of 'dismissed' provided in the report was the 
following: "The committee decided to dismiss those who are abusing 
the humanitarian field..."  While the implications of the 
designation remain unclear, both organizations suspended operations 
following the announcement.  One of the USAID partners dismissed is 
among the strongest organizations addressing the human rights 
situation and providing legal aid directly to victims.  The NGO is 
home to international awarding-winning human rights activists and 
receives funding support from USAID, the U.N. Development Program 
(UNDP), and other U.N. agencies. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Other key USAID partners with proven records of 
effectiveness in violence against women awareness advocacy, 
income-generation programs, and civil society skills training were 
placed at the 'middle' and 'weak' rankings.  One such organization, 
now under HAC review for the next six months, was recently visited 
by a high-level United States Government delegation in recognition 
of its role in organizing women and youth leadership trainings in 
support of the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue Consultation.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) It is not yet clear what the ramifications of the HAC 
rankings will be in practice.  Although the posting stated that 
Sudanese government officials, local police, and judiciary 
authorities would be informed of these decisions, USAID partners 
have not yet received written notification from the HAC. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) OCHA Nyala informed USAID that it had recently asked HAC 
to assist OCHA and the general humanitarian community in determining 
the validity of numerous new local NGOs whose numbers have 
significantly increased over the last year.  Many organizations 
exist in name only or are one-person operations.  One local NGO, 
although rejecting the HAC's rankings, acknowledged the need for the 
prevalence of poorly managed NGOs to be addressed.  It appears that 
HAC may have utilized the NGO review as a mechanism to obstruct the 
delivery of critical services, including legal aid and skills 
training to human rights victims and struggling civil society 
members.  The ranking seems to award groups that provide traditional 
relief services and punish groups who are implementing other 
activities, perhaps deemed 'political' by HAC or not perceived as a 
current humanitarian priority.  End comment.
