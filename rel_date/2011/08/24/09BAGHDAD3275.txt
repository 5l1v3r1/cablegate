SUBJECT: Iraq Partners Forum Discusses Election Preparations and UN 
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Iraq Partners Forum (IPF), which holds monthly meetings 
among the donors, UN, and World Bank to discuss international donor 
coordination, met on December 16 and focused on the UN's efforts for 
the upcoming elections and its strategic planning for assistance in 
the upcoming years.  Emboffs and representatives of the UK, EU, 
Sweden, Japan, Italy, Greece, Spain, Danish and Poland attended. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sandra Mitchell, head of UNAMI's Election Assistance Team, 
briefed donors on her team's role in advising the Independent High 
Electoral Commission (IHEC).  She expressed confidence that IHEC is 
fully capable of effectively executing the election, with support 
from UNAMI and USAID-funded International Foundation for Election 
Systems (IFES).  UNAMI is providing input to the election security 
planning process, and will field 14 observer teams on Election Day. 
In coordination with IFES, UNAMI will play a significant role in 
administering out-of-country voting.  (Note: Election briefing will 
be reported in septel.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Christine McNab, Deputy Special Representative of the 
Secretary General (DSRSG) for UNAMI's Office of Development and 
Humanitarian Support (ODHS), said that UNAMI has begun preparation 
for the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), which will 
guide the UN's collective work for 2011-2014.  UNAMI, in 
consultation with the GoI, has identified six priority areas for the 
UNDAF: Governance, Rule of Law, Diversified Economic Growth, 
Environmental Protection, Essential Services, and Human Capital. 
McNab noted that these areas are all in line with Iraq's draft 
National Development Plan, but stressed that the UNDAF strongly 
references international treaties and conventions, such as the 
Millennium Development Goals.  She added that UNAMI hopes to 
conclude the UNDAF with the current Iraqi government by late 
February, in advance of the UN's global deadline of late March for 
all UNDAFs.  McNab acknowledged that details of the UNDAF will have 
to be discussed between the new government and the separate UN 
agencies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) McNabb also discussed UNAMI's efforts to integrate its UN 
agencies and enhance UN cooperation with the international donor 
community.  UNAMI will focus its future efforts on the following 
programs: (1) address the social needs of those living in Iraq's 
Disputed Internal Boundaries; (2) focus on Iraq's transboundary 
water issues with Turkey, Syria and Iran; (3) support the GoI reform 
efforts of the Public Distribution System and help the GoI move 
towards the development of a social safety net; and (4) set 
benchmarks for GoI progress on civic registration and conducting the 
census. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a December 17 meeting with econoffs, UNAMI's ODHS 
program official Karin McLennan revealed that her office seeks  to 
refocus the IPF to launch assistance coordination in various 
sectors.  McLennan recommends that various UN agency heads also be 
included in future IPF meetings to improve information exchange 
between the UN and donors.  She also suggested that that the IPF 
tackle more contentious issues affecting Iraq, such as cross-border 
issues, the hydrocarbon law, and election and political issues as 
well as include countries from the region such as Turkey, Kuwait, 
Jordan and Egypt.
