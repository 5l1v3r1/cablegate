¶1. (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Director of 
Political Affairs Thomas Amolo briefed PolCouns on Kenya's 
plans as IGAD Chair to host two IGAD meetings in the coming 
months.  The first meeting will focus on Somalia and take 
place in late April.  It is likely to be a ministerial level 
meeting possibly followed up with a Heads of State summit. 
Prior to the meeting, Kenya plans to dispatch an MFA official 
to Mogadishu to "verify what we are hearing from the 
Transitional Federal Government about their reconciliation 
efforts."  Amolo frankly stated that Kenya's MFA does not 
give automatic credence to TFG assurances on "the 
inclusiveness of their approach."  Amolo continued, "the 
Somalia process has acquired sufficient momentum for us to 
meet soon to discuss how we can best help (President) Yusuf 
and gage how the AU/IGAD force is faring."  Amolo said the 
U.S. would be informed at least three weeks before the event 
to encourage the highest possible level of USG representation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Amolo said that Kenya is also planning to host an 
IGAD meeting on Sudan's Comprehensive Peace Accord.  However 
the timing on this meeting is uncertain.  "We are proceeding 
very carefully on this topic.  We have held preliminary 
discussions with our friends on both sides, Khartoum and 
Juba.  We want to hear a read out from the Assessment and 
Evaluation Commission before we proceed further.  We will 
only convene this meeting after thorough consultations with 
all concerned parties and IGAD members."  From Amolo's 
remarks, it appears as if the Sudan IGAD meeting will not 
take place until May at the earliest, but he declined to 
hazard a guess.  He did not specify whether that meeting will 
be at the ministerial or Heads of State level.  He reiterated 
assurances that the USG will receive at least three weeks 
advance notice.
