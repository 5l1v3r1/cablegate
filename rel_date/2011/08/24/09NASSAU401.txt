SUBJECT: CUBAN AMBASSADOR TO BAHAMAS, NAM: BRING BACK ZELAYA 
 
(U) The Cuban Ambassador urged Bahamians not to "turn their 
backs" on Honduras in an interview he gave to local media 
reported June 30.  "This is a situation which all democratic 
and peace loving people, all members of the non-aligned 
movement, should pay attention to.  We should join our voices 
in calling for the immediate return of the only 
constitutionally recognized president of Honduras, Mr. Zayala 
(sic).  And there should be no conditions attached to his 
reinstatement", the ambassador reportedly said.
