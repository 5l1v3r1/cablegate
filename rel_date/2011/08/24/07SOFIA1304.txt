¶1.  (SBU)  The Ministry of Finance announced November 11 that 
Bulgaria had agreed to cancel Iraq's 3.5 billion USD debt in 
exchange for a Paris Club comparable payment of 360 million 
USD in cash.  In a press conference announcing the deal, 
Minister of Finance Plamen Oresharski said the deal makes 
Bulgaria the first country to settle its Iraq debt with a 
one-time lump sum payment, which will be made in the first 
half of 2008.  Oresharski explained that Bulgaria's other 
option would have been to forgive 80 percent of Iraq's debt 
and collect the remaining 20 percent in obligation bills over 
a period of 23 years.  The deal with Iraq was signed, but 
publicly embargoed, in October in Washington, and was 
approved by the Bulgarian Council of Ministers on November 8. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Explaining the deal, FM Ivailo Kalfin said the 
settlement should be viewed in the context of Bulgaria's 
overall policy of support for the Iraqi Government's efforts 
to stabilize the country.  Initial reaction to the settlement 
has been positive, with financial commentators calling the 
cash deal astute, considering the alternative of collecting 
20 percent of the debt over 23 years.  Without criticizing 
the deal, opposition MP Martin Dimitrov from the Union of 
Democratic Forces expressed regret that the agreement had not 
been discussed by Parliament before it was approved. 
Predictably, the xenophobic Ataka Party attacked the deal, 
but its statements got little airplay.
