¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Department of Energy DAS Phyllis Yoshida met 
recently with Indonesian officials to discuss the timing of the next 
round of the Energy Policy Dialogue, and seek further engagement 
with the Indonesian government.  Former Energy Minister Purnomo 
Yusgiantoro supported a near time frame for a new round and 
advocated greater renewable energy engagement.  Officials from the 
National Development Planning Agency considered Yoshida's offer of 
greater engagement on clean energy policies to help mitigate climate 
change.  A senior member of Parliament suggested ways that U.S. 
officials could engage members of Parliament to address resource 
nationalism.  End Summary. 
 
Energy Policy Dialogue Preparation 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Then-Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Purnomo 
Yusgiantoro discussed issues for the next round of the Energy Policy 
Dialogue, although he was aware that he would not retain the energy 
portfolio following the new cabinet appointments on October 21. 
Purnomo agreed with DAS Yoshida that the EPD should have a strong 
focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy in addition to 
traditional energy sources.  Purnomo was interested in collaboration 
with NREL and Berkeley Labs.  He cited a Chinese solar power project 
in Indonesia, which is intended to have a capacity of 50 MW. 
However, he insisted that Indonesia "already gets too much from 
China, and we want balance" from other countries. 
 
¶3. (SBU) DAS Yoshida also stressed issues of cost recovery in a 
meeting with Saryono Hadiwidjoyo, Director of Oil and Gas Downstream 
Development at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.  She 
stated that contract sanctity was critical to attracting and 
retaining and foreign investment.  Saryono discussed subsidy policy, 
citing Indonesia's search for ways to alter Indonesia's costly 
consumer fuel subsidies without harming lower-income Indonesians. 
 
Climate Change and Energy Planning 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a meeting with National Development Planning Agency 
(BAPPENAS) officials Basah Herwono, Director for Forestry and Water 
Resources Conservation, and Montty Girianna, Director of Energy and 
Resources, DAS Yoshida focused on ways that DOE could collaborate on 
clean energy, including renewable energy, that would help mitigate 
climate change.  She mentioned DOE's intention to provide a $100,000 
grant for the Indonesian Climate Change Task Force for energy 
issues.  Yoshida highlighted that the new administration has 
declared energy a top priority, especially green growth goals. 
Basah and Montty committed to having proposals by November, most 
likely with a focus on an exchange of expertise. 
 
Parliamentary Outreach 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Member of Parliament Airlangga Hartarto made 
recommendations for greater engagement with Parliament.  Airlangga 
was the head of Commission 7 in the previous Parliament, which 
handles energy, power, and resource issues.  Indonesia's Parliament 
has become an advocate of resource nationalism, and Airlangga 
suggested several approaches to help current members of parliament 
incorporate international best practices and benchmarks in their 
energy legislation.  He stated that DOE could help establish a 
program to increase the MPs' awareness and knowledge of resource 
issues, although he was unclear whether MP visits to the United 
States, or U.S. experts' visits to Indonesia, would be more 
beneficial.  Airlangga also suggested exchanges that would increase 
the quality of the professional staff serving the commission and 
individual MPs.  Finally, he observed that Parliament lacks a good 
library with electronic resources, limiting legislative research 
opportunities, and asked for assistance developing one. 
 
¶6. (U) DAS Phyllis Yoshida cleared on this cable.
