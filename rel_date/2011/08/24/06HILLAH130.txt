SUBJECT: SISTANI  MOSQUE FRIDAY SERMON STRIKES ANTI-AMERICAN TONE 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Approximately 3500-4000 people attended the Friday 
afternoon sermon given by Sheikh Sayed Ahmed Al-Safi, generally 
regarded as a close associate and spokesman for Ayatollah Ali 
Sistani.   Al-Safi's speech was covered by several national 
television outlets. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Al-Safi told his audience that he did not want to talk 
about fuel and electricity shortages, but rather about the 
connection between the Coalition Forces and terrorism.  He said, 
"Terrorism cannot be active without official cover."  Safi noted 
that the American forces were supposed to protect Iraqi's 
borders with Turkey, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and 
Joran, but many foreign terrorists were still crossing the 
border, killing more and more, and introducing car bombs into 
the center of Iraqi cities.  Where is the twenty-one billion USD 
supposedly allocated for security,  Al-Safi rhetorically asked. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) During his speech, he gave several examples of how 
Coalition Forces cooperated with terrorists.  An American check 
point stops a man and asks him to leave his car, al-Safi 
continued.  A black hood is put over his head while they ask him 
questions.  In a minute, the hood is removed and the Americans 
apologize.  But when he drives away, he feels something is wrong 
- the Americans have turned his vehicle into a car bomb, Al-Safi 
melodramatically concluded.   In another example, a man was 
stopped by the Americans, his suitcase was taken away, and when 
it was returned to him, he discovered that it had been stuffed 
full of explosives. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Al-Safi referred to a recent VBIED attack in Al-Kufa 
in the vicinity of Muqtada al-Sadr's home, claiming that the 
Americans had ordered Iraqi police away from a checkpoint and 
replaced them, later letting a car bomb drive through and 
detonate, killing over sixty day laborers.   The Americans are 
talking about civil war, but are aggravating the fighting 
between Shi'a and Sunni by dividing Baghdad into sectarian 
neighborhoods, he stated.  Al-Safi concluded that the Baghdad 
Security Plan would surely fail because the terrorists are 
informed of when the Iraqi security forces intend to strike 
them. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  Al-Safi is close to Ayatollah Sistani, and 
this virulent speech is alarming.   The content will be regarded 
as truth by many moderate Sistani followers, and it will likely 
be cited by members of the Supreme Council of the Islamic 
Council in Iraq politicians in Najaf.  The speech may indicate 
Sistani is feeling increasingly pessimistic about a constructive 
role for Coalition Forces in resolving Baghdad's security 
problems. I END COMMENT
