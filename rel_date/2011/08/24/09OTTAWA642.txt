SUBJECT: CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER PRAISES AFGHAN ELECTIONS 
 
Â¶1.  (U)  In remarks to reporters in Pangnirtun, Nunavut on 
August 20, Prime Minister Stephen Harper said that "what is 
taking place in Afghanistan is remarkable" and praised the 
2009 Afghan elections -- "warts and all," noting the 
inherent difficulties involved in elections in a country that 
had gone through "thirty years of civil war" and "without any 
real history of democratic governance."  He especially lauded 
the contributions of Canadians -- military, diplomats, and 
development workers -- to the electoral process, along with 
other allies.
