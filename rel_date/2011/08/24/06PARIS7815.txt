¶1. SUMMARY:  In its December overview of the French economy, the 
French National Statistical Agency forecast GDP growth to rebound to 
3.6 percent (annualized) in the fourth quarter of 2006 after no 
growth in the third quarter.  The forecast puts 2006 GDP growth at 
2.1 percent, the bottom of the 2.0-2.5 percent range forecast by the 
government.  GDP in each of the first two quarters of 2007 is 
forecast to stay at 2.0 percent (annualized) due to a moderate 
deterioration in the global economy.  Slowing exports and a strong 
euro have led to calls from PM de Villepin and other French 
politicians for a clarification of the respective roles of the ECB 
and eurozone governments in setting exchange rate policy. Despite 
the slowing in GDP growth in the first half of 2007, the 
unemployment rate should decrease to 8.2 percent by June 2007 due to 
demographic factors.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GDP Growth Should Rebound in Q-4 
--------------------------------- 
¶2. INSEE raised its forecast of Q-4 GDP growth from 2.4 percent to 
3.6 percent, taking into account an October survey of manufacturers 
that showed business confidence near a five-year high, and portended 
a 1.3 percent increase in the production of manufactured products in 
Q-4.  Industrial production showed an unexpected 0.1 percent 
decrease in October compared with September due to a fall in the 
energy and capital goods sectors.  Nonetheless, production in the 
manufacturing sector including construction increased 0.3 percent 
compared with September.  The INSEE forecast is based on a 6.1 
percent (annualized) rebound in exports in Q4 after a 2.8 percent 
decrease in Q-3.  The French trade figures for October showed a 
larger-than-expected deficit of 2.7 billion euros due to an increase 
in imports and no increase in exports.  The foreign trade balance in 
the first ten months deteriorated to 23.7 billion euros (31 billion 
USD). 
 
¶3.  Eric Dubois, INSEE chief economist, said that "a fourth quarter 
rebound would correct the third quarter stagnation" (ref).  The Q-4 
GDP growth is above the 2.4-3.2 percent growth expected by Finance 
Minister Thierry Breton.  The INSEE forecast puts 2006 GDP growth at 
2.1 percent, the bottom of the 2.0-2.5 percent range forecast by the 
government.  If accurate, France would lag behind the 2006 euro zone 
growth rate of 2.6 percent projected by the European Central Bank. 
 
 
2.0 Percent (annualized) GDP Growth Expected 
for Q1 and Q2 2007 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶4.  INSEE forecast 2007 GDP to increase 2.0 percent (annualized) in 
Q-1 and Q-2 "if the international economic slowdown is not too 
pronounced" said Dubois, who also indicated that "the first half of 
2007 will fall back to a more moderate growth rate as foreign demand 
cools."   Demand for French exports would decrease due to a slowdown 
in global economic growth, which is expected to be dragged down by 
the US, China and Japan.  INSEE anticipates a tightening of monetary 
conditions in large economies including the U.S. and the euro zone. 
The first half of 2007 should be marked by an increase in the VAT in 
Germany, which would likely increase German consumption in Q-4 of 
2006, but would have a negative 0.2 percent impact on GDP in the 
euro zone in the first half 2007, and would increase euro zone 
inflation by 0.3 percent.  That said, economic growth surveys 
indicated significant job creation in the euro zone and a rebound in 
the construction sector in Germany.  INSEE based its forecast on a 
decrease in oil prices to 60 dollars per barrel and a euro equal to 
1.31 USD in the first half of 2007. 
 
¶5.  Lower growth in exports would be offset by dynamic household 
consumption.  INSEE forecast household consumption to increase 2.8 
percent (annualized) in Q-1 and Q-2 2007 thanks to an increase in 
purchasing power due to lower oil prices and a decrease in income 
taxes in 2007.  Companies may hesitate to invest due to an expected 
global economic slowdown in 2007.  INSEE forecast a 2.4 percent 
increase (annualized) in corporate investment in Q-1 and Q-2 of 2007 
after a 4.2 percent increase in 2006. 
 
Moderate Growth Sends the Unemployment Rate Down 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
¶6.  GDP growth should create 115,000 jobs (including 73,000 in the 
private sector) in the first half of 2007, sending the unemployment 
rate down to a 23-year low of 8.2 percent by the end of June 2007, 
from 8.8 percent in October.  Dubois explained that a 1.5 percent 
GDP growth rate would be sufficient to stabilize unemployment due to 
retirement of the generations born after the Second World War. 
Thus, a 2.0 percent growth should help reduce the unemployment 
rate.

Risks in the INSEE Forecast 
--------------------------- 
¶7.  On the one hand, the increase in VAT in Germany might be offset 
by a decrease in the savings rate, resulting in a positive effect on 
French exports.  And consumption in France could be higher than 
expected if the French adjust immediately to income tax cuts in 
early 2007.  On the other hand, the real estate market in the U.S. 
could take a harder tumble than expected.  And any further decline 
in the dollar would affect French exports outside the euro zone. 
INSEE did not provide an estimate of the impact of these risks on 
GDP growth. 
 
Government Urges more Coordination for the Euro 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶8.  Due to growing concerns about falling exports, Prime Minsister 
de Villepin urged more coordination between the European Central 
Bank and euro zone finance ministers, reiterating on December 11 
previous calls for clarification of the respective roles of the ECB 
and eurozone governments in exchange rate policy.  His urging, 
promptly echoed by presidential candidates Segolene Royal and 
Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, met with little support within 
the euro zone.  Many French economists blame falling exports on the 
inability of French exporters to take advantage of the strong global 
economy in 2006, rather than on the strength of the euro. 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
¶9.  Q-4 GDP growth looks like a "technical" correction to the 
unexpected Q-3 stagnation, and should allow the government to reach 
its 2006 GDP growth target.  A decrease in the unemployment rate to 
8.2 percent by June 2007 looks possible even with moderate 2.0 
percent economic growth in 2007. Clearly such results would play 
into the hands of the current government during the election 
end-game next spring.
