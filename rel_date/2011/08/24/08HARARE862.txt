On the Political/Social Front 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Mugabe and Tsvangirai sign deal... In a ceremony attended by 
other African leaders, President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister 
Morgan Tsvangirai signed their power sharing agreement on September 
15 in Harare.  Tsvangirai gave a concise speech discussing 
Zimbabwe's future and how to address the economic and social crises. 
 In contrast, Mugabe spoke for nearly an hour as he outlined the 
(external) sources of Zimbabwe's ills.  See Harare 833. 
 
¶4.  Mugabe Retains Significant Power... In the new power-sharing 
deal, Mugabe retains many of his executive powers such as chairing 
the National Security Council and the Cabinet, the ability to 
appoint the two Vice Presidents, 15 of the 31 members of Cabinet, 
and 8 senators.  As Prime Minister, Morgan Tsvangirai's power 
centers on his chairmanship of the Council of Ministers and 
overseeing policy formulation.  Arthur Mutambara is now a Deputy 
Prime Minister.  See Harare 842. 
 
¶5.  Tsvangirai Briefs Diplomats on Challenges...  In a briefing to 
the diplomatic corps on September 19, Tsvangirai described the 
contentious negotiation process and stalled allocation of 
ministries.  With Mugabe scheduled to leave for the UNGA, little 
progress is expected in the near term.  Tsvangirai also raised the 
prospect of having to go back to South Africa or SADC to get support 
for an equitable share.  See Harare 855. 
 
¶6.  MDC and ZANU-PF Reactions to the Deal Differ Sharply... There is 
considerable optimism about the agreement among MDC supporters. 
While cautious, they are hopeful the deal will lead to tangible 
quality-of-life benefits.  Zimbabwean and South African trade unions 
were not as optimistic and have criticized the agreement, and 
ZANU-PF insiders are engaged in a scramble to retain lucrative posts

and influence.  Significant questions remain as to how the deal will 
work and how the new government will function.  See Harare 837, 840, 
842, 843, and 854. 
 
¶7.  Students Arrested... 10 students at Bindura University were 
arrested on September 16 while protesting university fee increases 
(from $8000 to $30,000). The students were charged with criminal 
nuisance, fined $2000 and released after spending one night in 
jail. 
 
¶8.  Labor Leaders' Case Referred to Supreme Court... The freedom of 
speech case involving Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions' Secretary 
General Wellington Chibebe and President Lovemore Matombo will be 
heard by the Supreme Court on December 5.  The two were arrested and 
accused of "communicating falsehoods" and "inciting the public to 
rise against the government" after a speech on May 1.  As a 
condition of bail, granted on May 19, they were barred from 
addressing any political gathering until the matter is finalized. 
 
---------------------------------- 
On the Economic and Business Front 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  Zim Dollar Appreciates Following Signing Of Agreement...  The 
Zimbabwe dollar appreciated somewhat on the foreign exchange market 
with the bank transfer rate moving from about Z$50,000:US$1 a week 
ago to Z$45,000:US$1 by September 18, 2008.  Zimbabwe dollar cash 
also appreciated from Z$550:US$1 to Z$480:US$1 over the same period. 
 The appreciation largely reflects market anticipation of 
significant foreign currency inflows following the signing of the 
power-sharing agreement.  Given the current political stalemate and 
donors' wait-and-see attitude, the appreciation is likely to be 
short lived. 
 
¶10.  Another Step Toward Dollarization...  The Reserve Bank of 
Zimbabwe this week authorized exporters, with RBZ approval, to pay 
salaries in foreign currency to employees with "critical skills." 
 
¶11.  SADC Tribunal Dismisses Black Zim Farmers Land Claim... The 
SADC regional tribunal dismissed the complaint of over 300 black 
Zimbabweans that, because of the Tribunal's interim restraining 
order in the Campbell case contesting seizure of white-owned farms, 
they could not move onto land allocated to them by the GOZ.  The 
ruling judge said the applicants had not exhausted their legal 
options in Zimbabwe, and called the application frivolous and an 
abuse of process. 
 
¶12.  Gono Issues New Z$1,000 Note and Increases Withdrawal Limit... 
In view of skyrocketing inflation, the RBZ issued a new Z$1,000 note 
(about US$2 at today's cash rate) and doubled the daily cash 
withdrawal limit to Z$1,000.  Indicating a worsening cash shortage, 
banks are no longer getting their desired daily cash allocation from 
the RBZ. 
 
¶13.  Mostly Miserable Company Results Through June... 
 
-  In interim results to June 30, 2008, Hwange Colliery Company 
reported a 19% drop in total coal sales from 1,069,890 MT in H1 2007 
to 862,393 MT. 
 
-  Furniture giant TEDCO announced in the same reporting period 
turnover down 85% and a push into higher-margin markets in South 
Africa close to the Zimbabwe border. 
 
-  Dairibord's exports in the same period were up 23% but raw milk 
intake fell by 39%, indicating one reason why milk products 
disappeared from Zimbabwe's shelves this year. 
 
 
HARARE 00000862  003 OF 003 
 
 
-  National Foods reported milling volumes down 61% in the reporting 
year; the volume of oil processed was down 86%; the stock feed plant 
operated at 3.2% capacity; and of the company's fleet of 143 
vehicles, 113 were out of service due to shortages of spares and 
tires.
