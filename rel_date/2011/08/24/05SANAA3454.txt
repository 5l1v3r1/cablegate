SUBJECT: YEMEN OFFERS TO HOST FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE 
HEADQUARTERS, NOMINATES ERYANI FOR CHAIRMAN POST 
 
 
¶1. (U)  The Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) has offered 
to host the Foundation for the Future headquarters.  In a 
meeting between Deputy FonMin Mohy al-Din al-Dhabi and DCM, 
as well as via a dip note, the ROYG offered to cover the 
costs of providing a facility and local staff, promising also 
to "grant freedom and independence to the Foundation and its 
staff."  Al-Dhabi pointed out that this offer comes in lieu 
of Yemen's required cash contribution of USD 1,000,000 as a 
founding member of the Foundation. 
 
¶2.  (U)  In the same meeting and diplomatic note, the ROYG 
elicited the USG's support for its nominee for the 
chairmanship of the Foundation, Dr. Abdul-Karim al-Eryani. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Post strongly endorses Eryani's candidacy for the 
chairmanship.  A U.S.-educated former Prime Minister, Eryani 
is an erudite, cosmopolitan man who is well-respected 
throughout the region.  Eryani's intellectual interests are 
wide-ranging, and he is considered a resident expert in 
agriculture (in which he holds a doctorate), development, 
Arab and Islamic history, and regional politics.  Eryani is 
fluent in Arabic and English, and speaks some French.  We 
believe he would make an excellent chairman of the Foundation 
for the Future.
