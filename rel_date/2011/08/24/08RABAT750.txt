REF: STATE 077748 
 
¶1.  PolCouns delivered reftel points to Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) Chief of Staff Nasser Bourita on July 22. 
Bourita responded positively but noncommittally, saying that 
the Government of Morocco (GOM) supported the idea in 
principle but still had concerns about the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) stemming from what it 
perceived as Morocco's unfavorable treatment at the Universal 
Periodic Review session in Geneva on April 8 and during an 
OHCHR delegation visit to Morocco in 2006. 
 
¶2.  Bourita said the GOM was also sensitive to how questions 
on Western Sahara would be managed by the regional office if 
it was based in Rabat since the UN does not recognize 
Moroccan sovereignty over the territory, and the GOM strongly 
opposes the UN's treating Western Sahara as a separate 
entity. 
 
¶3.  PolOff followed up with Bourita on August 11, when the 
latter said that there had been "no evolution" in the GOM's 
thinking on the subject.  Bourita reiterated the GOM's 
discomfort with its previous experiences with the OHCHR and 
said that it would have to consider the question over a 
longer period of time.
