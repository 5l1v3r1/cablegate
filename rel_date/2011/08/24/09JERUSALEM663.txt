Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds leads with, and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam front page, 
news of Palestinian Authority (PA) President Abbas' visit to the 
Iraqi Kurdistan Region on April 13. Abbas met with Regional 
President Barzani and discussed the possibility of transferring 
Palestinian refugees from Baghdad to the Kurdish Region, a proposal 
welcomed by Barzani.  According to coverage, Abbas briefed Barzani 
on Palestinian issues including unity talks.  Abbas also reiterated 
his commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative calling it "fundamental" 
to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.  Barzani 
called Abbas' visit "historic" as Abbas is the first Arab leader to 
officially visit the region.  Barzani expressed the Kurdish people's 
support for Palestinians and their right to an independent 
Palestinian state, reporting concluded. 
 
Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam run front page coverage, citing Israeli daily 
Yedioth Ahronoth, about President Obama's intention to exert 
pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to accept the two-state 
solution and new negotiations with Palestinians.  According to 
coverage, Obama will insist on identifying a timeframe for the 
launch of negotiations and make clear that he expects progress in 
negotiations.  The report also notes that in return, Obama will 
promise to remain personally engaged in addressing "the Iranian 
threat" in the region.  The same articles also note the 
inevitability of U.S. talks with Iran. 
 
All front pages report on Palestinian Authority official Ahmad 
Quray's call on the international community and Middle East Quartet 
to intervene in the peace process given Israel's continued rejection 
of the two-state solution. According to coverage, Quray considers 
Netanyahu's proposed, "economic peace" a "joke."  In contrast, Quray 
expressed satisfaction with President Obama's action on the Israeli 
-Palestinian conflict and hopes that Obama will continue "solid 
efforts." 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page reports that PLO chief negotiator Sa'eb Erekat 
announced on April 13 that U.S. Peace Envoy Mitchell will meet with 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas in on April 17 and Israeli 
Premier Netanyahu, Defense Minister Barak and Foreign Minister 
Lieberman on April 16.  The report further quotes Erekat explaining 
that Abbas' recent telephone call to Prime Minister Netanyahu does 
not mean that Palestinian demands have changed.  In related news, 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages news that Abbas also called Israeli 
President Peres on the occasion of Passover. 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with news that dozens of 
"Jewish extremist groups broke into" the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on 
April 13 to perform "Jewish religious rituals." According to 
coverage which also appears on Al-Quds' front page, the groups broke 
into the mosque under heavy Israeli police protection and plan to 
stage a "massive break in" of the mosque compound on the last day of 
Passover. 
 
All dailies run front page coverage of Israeli military opening fire 
on a fishing boat sailing 1,000 feet from the Gaza shore on April 
Â¶13.  Israeli military released a statement that the boat was 
carrying explosives to be used in an attack on the Israeli navy, 
according to coverage. No injuries were reported.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Azmi Khawaja opines in Al-Ayyam daily independent under the 
title, "the Palestinian cause between Obama's moderation and 
 
JERUSALEM 00000663  002 OF 002 
 
 
Netanyahu's extremism"(04/14):  "Obama seems to be moderate and open 
to solving all the region's conflicts, particularly those in Arab 
and Muslim countries... He also prioritizes U.S. interests over 
Israeli interests.  He realizes that solving the Palestinian issue 
is the key to achieving stability in the Middle East... on the other 
hand, Netanyahu believes that relations with the Arab world must 
remain in permanent conflict... Should the Palestinian question go 
unresolved, it will embarrass Obama in front of Arab countries, 
particularly Saudi Arabia which considers the Arab Peace Initiative 
to its maximum concession [to Israel].  Therefore, Obama is expected 
to exert strong pressure on Israel to accept the two-state solution 
and aregional peace [deal]." 
 
2) Fathi Al-Bis opines n official Al-Hayat Al-Jadida daily under 
the tile, "it is not a courteous gesture" (04/14):  "Whyshould we 
congratulate Netanyahu on Passover, whe Israelis do not miss any 
opportunity to impose ll kinds of restrictions on our celebrations, 
whn settlers break into the Al-Aqsa [mosque compound, when the 
homes of Palestinians are demolished very day?  Could this gesture 
indicate that we ma also be congratulating Lieberman in the future 
s Israeli Foreign Minister?  These calls should no have been made. 
 It was unnecessary and unjustiied... in dealing with Israel, we 
should forget bout courteous gestures and seek only to impose 
rspect through power."
