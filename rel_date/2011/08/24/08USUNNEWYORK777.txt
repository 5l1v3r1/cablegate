¶1. (SBU) PolOff and SMCOff met August 21 with UN Department 
of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) Asia and Middle East 
Division Officer-in-Charge Mary Eliza Kimball and Middle East 
Team Leader Susan Allee to raise the points from ref A on the 
UNIFIL contingent's July 17 salute of Hizballah and 
Palestinian mortal remains and the photo of Imad Mughniyah 
which was attached to one of the trailers carrying the 
remains.  Kimball and Allee confirmed that the UNIFIL 
contingent, which had been in the area carrying out their 
normal duties, had saluted the flag-draped coffins, per their 
national service's custom, and likely did not realize whose 
photo it was.  Both Kimball and Allee said they had not found 
it acceptable when they learned of the salute.  They said the 
UNIFIL Force Commander was now alert to this type of problem, 
everyone's consciousness had been raised, and caution would 
be exercised in the future. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador DiCarlo raised the same points from ref 
A with DPKO Assistant Secretary General Edmond Mulet on 
August 25.  He confirmed that the UNIFIL contingent was not 
aware that the photo was of Imad Mughniyah and that UNIFIL 
staff have been told to be more cautious and attentive to 
this issue. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In their August 21 meeting with DPKO staff, 
USUNOffs noted to DPKO staff that Embassy Beirut no longer 
requires an advance submission of information by UNIFIL 
members scheduled to visit Embassy Beirut, per ref B, and 
that Embassy Beirut appreciates DPKO's assistance in handling 
the incidents that were previously discussed with them (ref 
C).
