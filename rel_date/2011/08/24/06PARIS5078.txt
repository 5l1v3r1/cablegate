DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 106075 
 
¶1. Poloff delivered reftel demarche on July 26 to Natalie 
Morro in the MFA Archives Office and Claude Chavance in MFA 
Legal Affairs.  Both interlocutors confirmed that the GoF did 
not anticipate any major obstacles to the ratification of the 
amendments.  They noted the ratification of the text by the 
French Parliament would add a great deal of weight to the 
Bonn Accord's legal stature in France, as it will be the 
first time the Accords will go before Parliament.  Both 
Chavance and Morro were enthusiastic about the result and 
confident of quick passage. 
 
¶2.  The text will first be presented to the Council of State, 
which will then send it on to Parliament for ratification. 
Parliament convenes in October/November 2006, but it is 
possible (for bureaucratic reasons) that the text would not 
be ready for ratification until the 2007 spring session.  The 
MFA promised to follow the case closely and advise post of 
any unforeseen problems.
