BACKGROUND

¶3. Begin Background. 
 
(U) Abbas Khorsandi is reportedly a political activist who 
was arrested on September 9, 2007, in his home in Firuzkuh, 
Tehran province.  He was previously arrested in early 2005 
and held for several weeks.  He may be/have been a member of 
the Democratic Party of Iran; the USG cannot confirm 
membership.  In February 2005, Human Rights Watch issued a 
press release noting his arrest.  Khorsandi has a history of 
heart attacks and suffers from diabetes. 
 
(U) Amnesty International has confirmed that five others were 
arrested on the same day in Tehran and Sanandaj: Meisam 
Roudaki, Bahram Rasekhifar, Mansour Faraji, Ghasem Shirzadian 
and Sepideh Puragha,i.  Amnesty International noted that 
Puragha,i is active with the Student Committee for the 
Defence of Political Prisoners, but it is unclear if the rest 
of the group, including Khorsandi were as well. 
 
(U) End Background.
