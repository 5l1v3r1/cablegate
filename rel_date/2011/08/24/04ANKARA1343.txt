SUBJECT: IRAQ: TURKEY TO TRAIN IRAQI DIPLOMATS 
 
 
We learned March 5 from Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Ankara 
rep Bahros Galali that Turkey will train Iraqi diplomats from 
May-June 2004 and that the Iraqi MFA had selected a list of 
Iraqi participants.  Turkish MFA Iraq deskoff Ferhat Alkan 
confirmed this information, saying that the Turkish MFA's 
training academy will organize the course for 20 Iraqi 
diplomats and had proposed to the Iraqi MFA that the course 
run May 3-June 11.  Alkan promised to provide more details in 
the coming days.  Comment:  This is an excellent opportunity 
to build bridges between Turkey and Iraq, and is exactly the 
type of cooperation we have been encouraging between these 
two neighbors.
