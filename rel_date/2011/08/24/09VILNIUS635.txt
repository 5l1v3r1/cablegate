¶2.  (U) The GOL will hold a Regional Command-West Conference

Conference Format and Presentations 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) MOD's Vice Minister Vytautas Umbrasas and MFA's Vice 
Minister Asta Skaisgiryte are scheduled to make opening 
remarks at the conference.  The conference format will 
consist of five sessions: 
 
--Security Challenges:  Regional Approach (moderated by 
Italy); 
 
--ISAF Operation: Towards Phase IV (moderated by Lithuania); 
 
--Support, Mentoring and Training of Afghan National Security 
Forces:  The Way Ahead for the Region (moderated by the U.S.); 
 
--Enhancing Civilian Dimension and Civilian Activities in 
PRTs and RC(W) HQ (moderated by Spain); and 
 
--Capacity Building and Supporting Reconstruction and 
Development (moderated by Lithuania). 
 
Each session will include a lead presentation followed by 
brief (ten minute) remarks by participating countries and a Q 
and A period.  The moderator will introduce speakers and 
guide the conversation.  The GOL requested that delegations 
submit a paragraph summarizing planned remarks as soon as 
possible.  In addition the GOL has offered to make time 
during the first session for a member of the U.S. delegation 
to present new developments in our Afghanistan policy 
including President Obama's decision on troop levels (if 
available by the time of the workshop).  The GOL is 
circulating a proposal for a civilian-military cell in 
RC-West (sent by email to SCA/A and EUR/NB).  GOL 
representatives will raise the idea during the conference. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Conference Goals and Conclusions 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Ultimately, the GOL hopes that conference 
participants can establish strategic plans for deeper 
coordination within RC-West, more equitable balancing of 
RC-West resources, enhanced civilian participation and the 
long-term goal of transfer of PRT responsibilities to local 
authorities.  The GOL will draft a paper to capture 
conference conclusions.
