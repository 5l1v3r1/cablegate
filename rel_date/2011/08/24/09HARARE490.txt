REF: SECSTATE 55499 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche on the nomination of 
Lucretia Myers to the UN International Civil Service 
Commission (ICSC) on June 10 to Godfrey Magwenzi, the head of 
Multi-Lateral Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Magwenzi was receptive to Ms. Myers' nomination and 
experience on the commission and promised to take the matter 
up with the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  He explained that 
while he could not guarantee an affirmative vote for Ms. 
Myers, he said her nomination was "straight forward" and 
"shouldn't be a problem." We expect Zimbabwe will vote for 
Ms. Myers' continued tenure on the ICSC.
