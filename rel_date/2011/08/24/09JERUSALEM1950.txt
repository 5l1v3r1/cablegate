Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds leads with a story that "Israeli radical elements," 
including religious leaders and politicians, have been inciting 
their followers to "intensify" their efforts to "break into" 
Al-Haram Al-Sharif. In a separate front-page article, the paper 
reports that the latest Israeli "escalations" at Al-Haram Al-Sharif 
are an attempt to establish a new status quo at the holy site. 
Al-Ayyam highlights a front-page report maintaining that the recent 
development in the Old City is the beginning of the "battle to 
divide Jerusalem." 
 
The dailies highlight a story quoting Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Presidency Secretary-General Tayyeb Abdel Rahim refuting Israeli 
press reports that PA President Mahmoud Abbas threatened to resign. 
Al-Quds notes that such claims are a part of the Israeli attempts to 
"create chaos." 
 
Al-Ayyam quotes PA chief negotiator Saeb Erekat stressing that he 
has serious doubts about any chance to resume negotiations anytime 
soon, citing Israeli "stubbornness."  Al-Hayat Al-Jadidat reports 
that Special Envoy George Mitchell is scheduled to arrive in the 
region tomorrow. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with a story that President Abbas has 
directed the head of the elections central committee, Hanna Nasser, 
to start preparing for presidential and legislative elections on 
January 24, 2010, the date stipulated in the recent presidential 
decree.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Independent Al-Quds editorializes in "Washington 
Retreats to Square One" (10/27): "The region and the Obama 
administration are retreating to square one. The administration is 
still trying to find a formula to restart negotiations ... Peace 
should have been achieved a long time ago ... The [American] 
mediation is progressing very slowly while faced with an 
unprecedented campaign of settlement activities and judaization [of 
Jerusalem], in addition to fierce attacks against Al-Aqsa Mosque ... 
The region is in vital need of serious and strong efforts to 
implement President Obama's promises ... including a complete stop 
to all settlement and judaization activities."
