SUBJECT: PRESIDENT MUBARAK'S VISIT TO KHARTOUM AND JUBA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Egyptian emboff told poloffs on November 12. that 
during President Hosni Mubarak's November 10 visit to Khartoum, he 
offered to invite Khalil Ibrahim to Cairo in an attempt to persuade 
the rebel Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) to commit to peace 
talks in Qatar   This offer has been welcomed by both President 
Bashir and the Qataris. In an otherwise largely symbolic but 
historic visit to Juba (the first ever by an Egyptian President to 
South Sudan), Mubarak met with Vice President Salva Kiir, and 
affirmed Egypt's commitment to making national unity attractive by 
announcing several new projects there in power, health and 
education. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On November 12 poloffs met with Tamer Azzam, political 
officer at the Egyptian Embassy, to be briefed on the surprise visit 
of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to Khartoum and Juba on November 
¶10. Azzam stated that the trip originated as a response to 
longstanding requests to visit Sudan from such GNU officials as 
Foreign Minister Deng Alor and Presidential Advisor Dr. Mustafa 
Osman Ismail. Characterizing the visit as "more symbolic than 
anything," Azzam stated that it served to display both Egypt's 
support for unity in Sudan, and its commitment to making it 
attractive. President Mubarak was accompanied on this visit by his 
Foreign Minister, Intelligence Chief, Media Chief, and Minister for 
Presidential Affairs. 
 
¶3. (SBU) President Mubarak and his delegation spent approximately 90 
minutes in a meeting with President Bashir and other Sudanese 
government officials.  Azzam stated that Bashir and Mubarak had a 
long discussion on Darfur, with Bashir briefing Mubarak on the 
evolution of the peace process from Abuja and Sirte to the Sudan 
People's Initiative. Azzam stated that Bashir was not happy with 
JEM's perceived reluctance to commit to talks, and that "he doesn't 
trust them. He thinks Khalil Ibrahim has his sights not on Darfur, 
but on Khartoum." President Mubarak responded by offering to invite 
Ibrahim to Cairo for discreet talks with unnamed GOS officials, in 
an effort to persuade JEM to commit to attending peace talks in 
Doha. Azzam characterized this offer as a continuation of the 
Egyptian's ongoing involvement in the peace process and said it was 
welcomed by Bashir, as well as the Qataris. "We expect to make this 
happen very soon, perhaps in the next month or so," he added. 
Mubarak also offered to speak to the French about putting additional 
leverage on Abdul Wahid Nur to attend the talks, he said. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In addition to Darfur, Bashir and Mubarak also discussed 
CPA implementation and the importance of making north-south national 
unity attractive, as well as bilateral cooperation on economic 
development projects. Contrary to media reports, the ICC was not 
discussed or even mentioned said Azzam. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Following his meeting in Khartoum, President Mubarak and 
his delegation flew to Juba in a trip designed to show Egypt's 
commitment to all of Sudan and to making unity attractive. In 
addition to meeting Vice President Salva Kiir (who is also President 
of the Government of South Sudan) to discuss CPA implementation and 
joint economic cooperation, Mubarak also visited the John Garang 
Memorial and Juba's Egyptian Clinic. He announced several new 
Egyptian commitments to development in the South, including the 
construction of four power plants, several new clinics, the opening 
of a new branch of Alexandria University in the South, and the 
establishment of 100 new scholarships for Southern Sudanese at 
Egyptian universities. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: This was only Mubarak's second visit to Khartoum 
since 1989, and his first ever to Juba. (Note: Relations between 
Egypt and Sudan have not been particularly warm since the 1995 
Sudanese-supported assassination attempt on President Mubarak in 
Addis Ababa. End note.) The Juba visit is especially welcome as a 
boost to the fleeting effort to make unity attractive to Southern 
Sudanese and in recognizing the role of the SPLM and GOSS in Sudan. 
In terms of Darfur, Egypt's alleged offer to host an Ibrahim visit 
to Cairo could help jump-start the behind-the-scenes talks that will 
be prerequisite to successful negotiations. Qatar's amenability to 
Egyptian engagement is a promising development, as bickering among 
Arab League countries-particularly Libya--has the potential to sully 
the process. However, neither Libya nor Egypt is particularly happy 
about the Qatari initiative. Both presumably view the latter as 
Qatar's interfering in their neighborhood.
