 EconOff passed reftel points May 11 to Juan Luis Munoz de la 
Borde, MFA's Deputy Director for Multilateral Economic 
Relations.  Munoz de la Borde confirmed that Second Vice 
President and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes would attend the 
OECD Ministerial.  Munoz de la Borde also noted that while 
Spain was receptive to the viewpoints of the US on membership 
and financing, Spain had no particularly strong stance on 
these issues. Spain's primary position, Munoz de la Borde 
said, would be one of encouraging compromise.
