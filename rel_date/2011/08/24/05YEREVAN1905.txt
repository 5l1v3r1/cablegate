(SBU)  On October 26, a local Armenian newspaper, citing the 
Iranian Students' News Agency, reported that 5,000 migratory 
birds died near the Armenian-Iranian border in the Atrpatakan 
province of Iran.  The Iranian name for this area is West 
Azerbaijan.  According to the press coverage, birds in the 
Atrpatakan region are dying at a rate of 70 per day.  On 
October 12, the World Organization for Animal Health (French 
acronym OIE) reported that approximately 3,673 birds had died 
in West Azerbaijan.  It is not clear whether the Armenian 
press coverage refers to the original OIE-reported deaths or 
a second wave of bird deaths.  According to an October 26 
article on the Tehran Times website, Tehran-based World 
Health Organization Representative Dr. Mobasher Riyadh Sheikh 
said there have been no observed cases of bird flu in Iran. 
He also said the dead birds from the West Azerbaijan province 
tested negative for the H5N1 virus.
