1.(SBU) SUMMARY.  USG Pascoe briefed the Security Council on 
the political and security issues in Guinea-Bissau.  He 
focused on the preparations for the November 16 legislative 
elections and the growing threat of narco-trafficking.  He 
emphasized the suggestion of the SYG's report that an 
international experts' panel might assist with the drug 
issue.  Burkina Faso drafted a Presidential Statement (PRST), 
generally supporting Guinea-Bissau's development efforts and 
expressing concern for the narco-trafficking problem. 
Brazil, chair of the PBC effort in Guinea-Bissau, lobbied 
against any reference to the panel in the PRST. 
Guinea-Bissau itself is unenthused about the prospect of an 
experts' panel.  The idea of an experts' panel gained 
considerable interest but little active support. END SUMMARY.

Pascoe Briefs UNSC-Drugs and Election Main Concerns 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) USG for Political Affairs Lynn Pascoe presented the 
Secretary-General's quarterly UNOGBIS report on October 7 to 
the Security Council, stressing the preparations in place for 
the "crucial" November 16 legislative elections.   He noted 
the Government of Guinea-Bissau (GOGB) was very open in 
acknowledging the dangers and impact of narco-trafficking in 
Guinea-Bissau.  He reiterated the report's concern that 
Guinea-Bissau is no longer merely a transit hub, but appears 
to be fast becoming a major market place in the drug trade. 
Pascoe suggested that an international experts' panel could 
send a message of strong international support as UNOGBIS 
looked for ways to help the GOGB address the drug problem. 
 
¶3. (U) All Security Council members called for free, fair, 
and transparent elections on November 16.  Additionally, all 
members supported the regional conference to address 
narco-trafficking, planned by ECOWAS for October 28-29.

Debate over Experts' Panel, What is Brazil Doing? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4.  (U) The representatives from Libya, Italy, and Indonesia 
all stated an experts' panel would be a useful way to address 
the problem of narco-trafficking.  The French, British, and 
Burkinabe representatives called for further discussion 
regarding the panel, while the Russian and Costa Rican 
representatives wanted more details and views on implications 
of such a panel.  Only South African PermRep Kumalo stated he 
did not believe an experts' panel was the answer to 
drug-trafficking.  Kumalo called for strengthening the 
counter-narcotics capacity of Guinea-Bissau's domestic 
institutions, through international efforts bolstering law 
and order programs.  He said, "we don't need to subject a 
fragile democracy to an experts' group." 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Burkina Faso tabled a PRST generally supportive of 
Guinea-Bissau's efforts on elections and economic development 
and welcoming ECOWAS sponsorship of a regional conference on 
drug trafficking.  An early version of the PRST included a 
reference to the SYG's call for an international panel of 
experts to be created to consider drug trafficking and 
organized crime in Guinea-Bissau.  Burkina Faso deleted the 
reference, reportedly after Brazil, chair of the 
Peacebuilding Commission Configuration for Guinea-Bissau, 
lobbied against it.  Negotiations continue as some members, 
including the U.S., push to include language calling upon 
Guinea-Bissau to take relatively more responsibility for 
leading election and counter-narcotics efforts.

Guinea-Bissau Lukewarm to Expert's Panel 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Ambassador DiCarlo expressed USG concern over the 
threat of narco-trafficking in Guinea-Bissau. She called on 
the GOGB to account for official actions regarding the July 
12 arrival of a reportedly illicit air cargo from Venezuela. 
She called on the GOGB to take a strong leadership role in 
combating trafficking.  The Guinea-Bissau PermRep Cabral 
agreed with DiCarlo, saying in the session the GOGB needed to 
show leadership to address the drug problem, and he noted the 
GOGB was primarily responsible for the peace and security of 
its country.  He argued, however, that Guinea-Bissau needs

continued international assistance in order to build domestic 
institutions equal to this enormous task. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Cabral, in the margins after the meeting, told 
DepPolCouns that he personally is unenthused about the SYG's 
idea of an international experts' panel to address the drug 
issue.  He said Guinea-Bissau would prefer international 
assistance to bolster his nation's ability to target 
drug-trafficking and organized crime through domestic 
institutions.
