REF: A. A) HAMBURG 035 
     ¶B. B) HAMBURG 031 
 
¶1. (U) Just a week after the state parliamentary elections, 
Bremen's Social Democratic Party (SPD) leadership announced on 
May 20 that it will seek to form a governing coalition with the 
Greens, bringing an end to twelve years of a Social 
Democratic-Christian Democratic (SPD-CDU) Grand Coalition.  Jens 
Boehrnsen (SPD) will continue as Mayor and President of the 
Bremen Senate (Minister President).  Bremen's new governing 
coalition will be the first SPD-Greens coalition at the state 
level since the end of the Red-Green Coalition in the North 
Rhine-Westphalia 2005 state elections.  Greens Party leadership 
met on May 21 and decided to enter into coalition negotiations, 
however Greens Deputy Caucus Leader Matthias Gueldner stated 
that formal negotiations will begin after the Whit Monday 
holiday (May 28) and should be concluded by the end of June. 
Both the SPD and Greens will hold party conventions on May 24 to 
formalize the decision. 
 
¶2. (U) Prior to the SPD's announcement, CDU State Chairperson 
Bernd Neumann announced that his party was planning to go into 
the opposition.  Bremen CDU leadership will hold a specialQeting on May 22 to "set the course for a powerful role as the 
opposition" and redefine the party's profile in the city-state. 
The new Red-Green Coalition is expected to focus more on social 
issues, an area that plagued the Grand Coalition with several 
scandals over the past year. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The SPD's decision will affect the federal Grand 
Coalition's two-thirds majority in the Bundesrat.  While Bremen 
only holds three seats in the Bundesrat, the federal SPD-CDU 
coalition requires two of them to maintain the two-thirds 
majority necessary for constitutional amendments.  Such 
decisions will now require that the SPD and CDU convince one of 
the "neutral bloc" states in which a federal opposition party is 
a coalition partner to support the legislation (Ref A). 
Further, the May 20 announcement of the Red-Green Coalition is 
yet another signal that the SPD may start turning to its left 
flank in order to maintain its traditional voter base and appeal 
to new voters in future elections.
