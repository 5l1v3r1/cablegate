Scattered Violence as Abbas Visits Gaza 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) There was sporadic factional and clan violence in 
Gaza late May 22 to 1500 local.  On May 24, Hamas and Fatah 
both submitted lists of the other faction's ceasefire 
violations to the Follow-up Committee (formed May 19 under 
Egyptian auspices and with participation of Egyptian General 
Intelligence Service MG Burhan Hamad).  Late May 23, unknown 
gunmen shot and injured two PSO guards near Fatah 
spokesman/al-Aqsa Brigades leader Maher Miqdad's home 
(Muqawsi tower) in Gaza City.  Late May 22, security forces 
reported finding and defusing a bomb in front of retired 
Bahriya (Coastal Patrol) commander Juma'a Ghali's home in 
Gaza City.  Fatah and Hamas traded accusations of sporadic 
shootings, establishment of illegal checkpoints, and 
restationing of gunmen on rooftops. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) President Abbas visited Gaza and met with PM 
Ismayil Haniyah May 23.  They reportedly discussed the 
Hamas-Fatah ceasefire and a possible ceasefire with Israel. 
 
Qassams and Israeli Strikes Continue 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) 13 Qassam rockets struck Israel from 1400 (local) 
May 22 to 1500 May 24 causing substantial property damage to 
a vehicle and agricultural facilities, but no injuries. 
Rockets hit Sderot, Kissufim and south of Ashkelon.  Hamas 
claimed 18 rocket and five mortar launches during this 
period.  Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and the PRCs also claimed 
launches. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Palestinian media and security contacts report that 
IDF fire killed a Palestinian man in Bayt Lahiya on May 24. 
Late May 23, IAF airstrikes injured 8 Palestinians (3 
seriously) in strikes on a warehouse, brick factory, money 
exchange shops, an "Executive Force" position and vehicles. 
A Palestinian woman died May 24 of injuries previously 
sustained in an IAF airstrike. 
 
IDF Arrests 33 West Bank Hamas Figures 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Arabic-language press/television report that the 
IDF arrested 33 Hamas officials in the West Bank early May 
24, including PA Education Minister Nasser al-Din al-Sha'ar, 
3 Hamas PLC members, several Hamas Mayors including those of 
Nablus and Qalqiliya, and the heads of northern West Bank 
Islamic charities.  Palestinian security contacts say the IDF 
confiscated computers, documents and office equipment at most 
arrest locations.  Palestinian security contacts say arrest 
operations continued in the West Bank throughout recent 
Israeli operations in Gaza, but the May 24 arrests are the 
first targeting of the West Bank Hamas leadership since the 
current round of fighting erupted in Gaza.
