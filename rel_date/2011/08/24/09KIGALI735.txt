SUBJECT: CONGOLESE AMBASSADOR ARRIVES IN RWANDA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Norbert Nkulu from the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (DRC) arrived in Kigali November 2, to begin an 
assignment as the DRC's ambassador to Rwanda--the first since 
Presidents Kabila and Kagame took office.  Ambassador met 
Nkulu on November 5, at a reception during which Nkulu warmly 
engaged Rwandan and other diplomatic counterparts.  He said 
he "attached great personal importance" to developing 
relations with Rwanda and improving commercial relations 
between the DRC and the East African Community.  Nkulu told 
Ambassador he had been "very well received" upon his arrival 
in Kigali, and accepted an invitation to attend an upcoming 
reception in honor of visiting Special Adviser for the Great 
Lakes Dr. Howard Wolpe. 
 
¶2. (SBU) BIO NOTES: Nkulu, who is temporarily residing at the 
Serena Hotel in Kigali, told Ambassador that he previously 
had served as minister of state for President Joseph Kabila. 
He is married, with five children ranging in age from 30 to 
¶10.  He speaks French, but little English;  his wife 
Veronique, a lawyer by profession, speaks English fluently 
and translated for him at the November 5 reception. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: The arrival of the Congolese ambassador, 
whose Rwandan counterpart recently arrived in Kinshasa, is a 
significant milestone in the developing relationship between 
Rwanda and the DRC.  It follows the groundbreaking August 6 
summit, when Rwandan President Paul Kagame walked across the 
border to meet in Goma with President Kabila, and reflects 
ongoing contacts and increased cooperation between the two 
countries, not just between security officials but also 
between those dealing with energy, foreign affairs and 
economic integration.
