¶E. O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON EPET EFIN ETRD AMGT ZI
SUBJECT: GOZ adds more price controls 
 
 
¶1. Summary: The macroeconomically-challenged GOZ expanded 
its price freeze list on December 28. New controls will 
lead to further shortages and a burgeoning black market. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. Over the past months, the GOZ has rapidly expanded its 
price freeze.  The latest list includes school uniforms, 
tracksuits, toothpaste and a host of other products.  The 
GOZ is attempting to rein in inflation, which it now 
officially -- and very conservatively -- pegs at 175 
percent.  Unlike previous controls, this latest series 
fixes rates that are higher than current market prices. 
For that reason, it will take several months for 
Zimbabwe's inflation to lift market-determined prices to 
the officially-sanctioned maximums. 
 
¶3. Comment: Price controls will continue to cause rather 
than alleviate high inflation.  The GOZ is fixing the 
prices of every item it can think of while trying to 
clamp down on the repackaging game.  (Bureaucrats at the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade must now approve each new 
product.)  Unrealistically low price freezes have caused 
widespread shortages, making it unprofitable to produce 
maize, bread, sugar, meat, milk and cooking oil.  We 
expect the list of "endangered" staples to grow as firms 
shut down unprofitable product lines.  Low supply/heavy 
demand in the informal marketplace will soon push real 
inflation to hyper- or near hyper-levels.
