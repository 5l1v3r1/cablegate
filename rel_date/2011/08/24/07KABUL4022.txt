SUBJECT: SPECIAL MEDIA REACTION: AMIDST MUSA QALA FIGHTING, AFGHANS 
BLAME BRITISH TROOPS FOR ITS TAKEOVER BY TALIBAN 
 
 
1) SUMMARY: As Afghan and Coalition forces attempt to recapture the 
Musa Qala District of Helmand Province from the Taliban, Afghan 
editorialists blame British forces there for allowing it to fall to 
the Taliban in the first place. A deal struck between British forces 
and local tribal elders in February collapsed soon after, and the 
Taliban overran the district. Commentators are optimistic about the 
operation's success. But they bemoan the opportunity the Taliban has 
had there to rearm, train, and grow poppy, and warn that only the 
continued, augmented presence of Afghan security forces will keep 
the Taliban from retaking the district. END SUMMARY. 
 
2) An unsigned editorial in independent daily Arman-e-Millie 
entitled "Why Musa Qala Turned into a Terrorist Stronghold," stated 
that, "The military operation by Afghan, U.S., and British forces to 
recapture Musa Qala in Helmand Province is in progress and it seems 
as if they might succeed in clearing the town of Taliban and other 
terrorists, but this is not the subject to be discussed. Rather, the 
subject is how the Taliban were able to capture Musa Qala and turn 
it into a terrorist stronghold in the first place almost a year ago. 
 
 
The so-called 'political accord' between the British forces and the 
tribal elders was broken by the Taliban insurgents and they were 
able to carry heavy artillery and modern weapons from the other side 
of the border to stand firm and fight the Afghans and Coalition 
Forces. Right after this occurrence, some intelligence agencies 
started shouting that the Taliban are a reality, military operations 
against them are not the best solution, and we should hold talks 
with them. 
 
But after ten months, they found out that the Taliban are not only 
threatening Afghanistan, but the region and the world. They must be 
defeated by military operations. This unacceptable process shows 
that the international forces have been mistaken in their fight 
against terrorism, and they have only looked after their own 
interests, which is very hard for the Afghans' to understand.  If 
the foreign forces are really committed to defeating the terrorists 
in Afghanistan and the region, then they should clear every other 
region under the Taliban's control, in addition to Musa Qala, and 
should seek strategies to prevent their future recapture by the 
Taliban by any means." 
 
 
3) An unsigned editorial in independent daily Weesa entitled, "The 
Musa Qala Accord Was Not a Good Game to Have Played," stated that, 
"The Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and international forces 
are gathered in Musa Qala to put pressure on the Taliban and force 
them to leave the region. Musa Qala fell to the Taliban after a 
simple accord on a piece of paper was signed by British troops with 
the tribal elders. The results show that the Musa Qala accord was a 
gamble, and the ANSF and NATO forces have suffered badly from its 
consequences. 
 
The fall of Musa Qala to the Taliban was a success for the Taliban, 
and a big morale booster for them as well. Now, if the government 
succeeds in recapturing the district, then it will be a morale 
booster for the government after months of psychological pressure by 
the Taliban and their insurgent activities." 
 
4) An unsigned editorial in independent daily Rahenejat "The Need 
for a Major Government Presence in Troubled Areas," stated that, 
"Efforts to recapture the troubled district of Musa Qala are being 
exerted after almost a year of the Taliban's presence there. The 
Taliban turned Musa Qala into a safe haven for poppy cultivation and 
drug trafficking. Meanwhile, there were no plans to recapture the 
district by the ANSF or the allies to be found. The collapse of Musa 
Qala paved the way for the foreign terrorists to create obstacles 
for the Government of Afghanistan and its allies. There have been 
several attempts to reclaim the district by negotiating with tribal 
elders rather than by military operations, but these have proven 
insignificant. 
 
During this period the people in Musa Qala have suffered a great 
deal. Living under the rule of the terrorists, there have been times 
when they were used as human shields in fighting the ANSF and 
Coalition forces.  The Government of Afghanistan and its allies 
 
KABUL 00004022  002 OF 002 
 
 
should have attempted to recapture the district long ago, and should 
have prevented the Taliban insurgents from training and equipping 
their evil forces in the area. 
 
The Government and the Coalition forces' shortfall in training the 
Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police is felt all the 
time, and this has been a major factor in the collapse of many 
districts and regions into the hands of the Taliban. Therefore, the 
government should also consider guarding the recaptured regions an 
important issue as well."
