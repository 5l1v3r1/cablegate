REF: SECSTATE 117357 
 
Â¶1. (SBU)  DepPolCouns discussed reftel points with MFA D4 
Directorate for Human Rights head Ilias Fotopoulos. 
Fotopoulos believed Greece would vote against a no-action 
motion and in favor of the resolution condemning the 
deteriorating human rights situation in Iran.  He said, 
however, that consultations within the EU continued and that 
Greece would follow the EU consensus, whatever that turned 
out to be.  He promised to inform us once the EU position 
became clear.  Fotopoulos confirmed that his Directorate -- 
and not only the D1 Directorate for International 
Organizations -- had authority to provide instructions to the 
Greek mission at the UN.
