SUBJECT: KAZAKHSTAN: AMBASSADOR'S JULY 3 MEETING WITH 
SECURITY COUNCIL CHAIR TAZHIN 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  In a July 3 meeting with the Ambassador, 
Security Council chair Marat Tazhin responded favorably to a 
suggestion that Kazakhstan allocate funds to supplement FMF 
funding for the purchase of UH-II helicopters through the 
Foreign Military Financing program, stated that Kazakhstan 
was looking for ways to assist in the reconstruction of 
Afghanistan, and promised to speak with the Procurator 
General regarding the latter's tough stance on political 
party training.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a July 3 meeting with Security Council chairman 
Marat Tazhin, the Ambassador floated the idea of Kazakhstan 
allocating funds to supplement U.S. funding provided through 
the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program to purchase 
UH-II helicopters for use in the Caspian region.  In a time 
of shrinking U.S. assistance budgets, such co-funding would 
be an important sign of Kazakhstan's dedication to the 
project, the Ambassador noted.  Tazhin indicated that the 
idea was workable and promised to discuss it with Defense 
Minister Altynbayev.  (Note:  Deputy Prime Minister Masimov 
also responded enthusiastically to the suggestion in a June 
28 meeting with the Ambassador.  End note.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Ambassador told Tazhin that the U.S. would like 
to see Kazakhstan become more involved in Afghanistan, 
including through participation in a Provincial 
Reconstruction Team (PRT).  The July 20-21 conference in 
Budapest would be an excellent opportunity to obtain more 
detailed information.  Tazhin replied that Afghan President 
Karzai had asked President Nazarbayev for help with 
reconstruction during their recent meeting on the margins of 
the June 17 CICA Summit in Almaty.  Nazarbayev had ordered 
the government to come up with concrete proposals; the MFA 
was now working on this. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Touching briefly on issue of training of political 
parties by U.S. NGOs, the Ambassador explained that we had 
had an ongoing dialogue with the Procuracy for several years 
regarding what types of activities were permissible and what 
would be considered "financing" of a political party and 
therefore not permissible.  In a recent meeting, Procurator 
General Tusupbekov had taken a more hard-line position than 
before, saying that any type of exchange of information 
constituted financing and was therefore illegal.  Tusupbekov 
had recognized, however, that Kazakhstan welcomed and needed 
U.S. assistance in the area of political development and had 
suggested that the U.S. raise the issue with the Presidential 
Administration.  Tazhin said that he would ask Tusupbekov why 
he was taking such a tough stance on this issue now.
