SUBJECT: IRAN PRESS/NUCLEAR - NOVEMBER 23 - SUPREME COUNCIL FOR 
NATIONAL SECURITY DEPUTY HEAD ALI BAQERI 
 
TITLE:  NSC Deputy: The West Isn't Ready to Continue Discussions 
 
 
 
SUMMARY: In an extensive November 23 IRNA story ( IRNA, 
official, pro-Ahmadinejad), covering remarks made by National 
Security Deputy Head Ali Baqeri in a meeting concerning Iran's 
nuclear positions at Shahid Beheshti University, Baqeri said 
[unless otherwise noted, all comments are direct quotes]: 
 
 
 
- Despite the expression of satisfaction by Solana in the 
October 28 communication with Mr. Jalili and the agreements 
carried out at the Geneva 2 negotiations, apparently the other 
side doesn't have the necessary readiness for continuing 
discussions~ The main issue is internal problems with the other 
side [i.e. the West] and the Friday Brussels meeting showed that 
the other side doesn't view the continuation of discussions as 
in its interest. 
 
 
 
-[on Iran producing 20 percent fuel]: From a technical viewpoint 
we have no problems producing this fuel and if other countries 
don't give us this fuel we ourselves can produce it.  From a 
legal viewpoint we don't have any problems providing fuel for 
the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) because there is no barrier 
for any country enriching above 5 percent or 20 percent and if 
the IAEA can't provide IAEA fuel we'll produce it domestically. 
 
 
 
- From a technical viewpoint we have no problems producing fuel, 
based on the Security Council agreement import and export of 
materials is forbidden but the request of these countries shows 
that they have retreated from their position.  We have reached 
the position where Iran's performance has changed a field of 
opposition to one of interaction. 
 
 
 
- Iran has no problem transferring 3.5 percent fuel but on the 
condition that provision of TRR fuel is 100 percent guaranteed 
and definitely if there are any doubts or uncertainties we won't 
enter the deal/exchange and this is the Islamic Republic of 
Iran's position. 
 
 
 
- The only way is that this exchange occur on Iranian soil and 
in this case the guarantee is definite. 
 
 
 
- [student question: if Iran gives its fuel and doesn't get TRR 
fuel back?]: Who said it was arranged for Iran to send out its 
fuel?  One of the ways of a 100 percent guarantee of getting TRR 
fuel is conducting the exchange of 3.5 percent fuel for 20 
percent fuel inside Iran. 
 
 
 
- Western countries don't live up to their commitments.  For 
example we bought 60 tons of UF6 from France but it didn't give 
it to us and despite the fact that a French court ruled in 
Iran's favor France still refrained from giving it to Iran. 
Also, the Germans, Canadians and the Brits have repeatedly 
violated their commitments in relation to Bushehr. 
 
 
 
- [Question re Russian obstructionism re Bushehr]: Up to the 
present the Russians have delivered 80 tons of fuel for the 
Bushehr power plant to us, but we have not signed a brotherhood 
pact with anyone. 
 
 
 
- All countries pursue their own interests. Nonetheless Russia's 
non-fulfillment of their commitments is definite, although there 
have been problems in the process of meeting the needs of the 
Bushehr reactor.
