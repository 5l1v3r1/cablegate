SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR FUEL BANK - RUSSIA STILL 
HOPEFUL FOR IAEA JUNE GB MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 057598 
 
(SBU) We reviewed reftel points on establishing an 
international nuclear fuel bank with MFA Office of Security 
and Disarmament Affairs First Secretary Olga Kuznetsova on 
June 9.  Kuznetsova noted that Russia was expecting the 
discussion at the IAEA Governing Board (GB) June 15-18 in 
Vienna to be "far from simple," because of the skeptical 
countries on the GB and the opponents among the IAEA members 
that don't want to see any discussion of a nuclear fuel bank 
because they believe it infringes upon their countries' right 
to develop a nuclear fuel cycle.  Kuznetsova explained that 
Russia has been trying to convince some of the skeptics that 
having an international nuclear fuel bank actually reinforces 
countries' right to develop peaceful nuclear energy. 
Commenting that Russia will see at the GB meeting to what 
degree its demarches have been successful, Kuznetsova said 
that Russia is "still hoping against hope" that the June GB 
will endorse the "U.S., Russian, and German" proposals that 
were distributed by the IAEA Director General, but realizes 
that this is not likely.  (Embassy note:  Although we 
referred to the first proposal as an IAEA proposal, 
Kuznetsova called it a "U.S." proposal.  End note.)  If the 
June GB cannot approve the proposals, Kuznetsova stated that 
Russia's Governor Berdennikov intends to support the IAEA 
Director General's recommendation that the GB instruct the 
Director General to further develop the proposals and submit 
them to the September GB for discussion in an effort to reach 
consensus.  She predicted that this would take some time.
