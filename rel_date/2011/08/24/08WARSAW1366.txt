¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  The Polish government is keenly aware of 
the challenges in Pakistan and the importance of managing 
them successfully.  Provided that it can muster a meaningful 
donation, Poland is likely to attend the proposed conference, 
although no information is available regarding the level at 
which it might be represented.  However, whether Poland could 
make a meaningful donation is a real question, given the 
limited time before the proposed conference date of December 
16, the congested foreign affairs calendar between now and 
then, and the scale of other Polish giving in the region 
(especially to Afghanistan).  The Poles would appreciate more 
information regarding (1) the planned U.S. pledge, (2) how 
firm the December 16 date is, and (3) the technical mechanism 
for making donations.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  EconOff delivered reftel demarche on November 28 
to Ambassador Jerzy Wieclaw, Head of the South Asia Section 
in the Asia-Pacific Department at the Polish Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  On December 1, Wieclaw told EconOff that he 
has not yet gotten any feedback from the Minister, but his 
view from the "experts level" is that Pakistan does need 
help.  He stated that for the Polish government the success 
of ISAF/OEF in Afghanistan is an overarching issue, and the 
Poles are aware of "regional inter-linkages."  Wieclaw also 
stated that he had heard the results from a Friends of 
Pakistan meeting in Abu Dhabi had not been terribly 
encouraging, and understood the need for a donors conference. 
 He cautioned, however, that the amount needed -- USD 4 
billion -- is an "impressive figure," and time is short. 
Poland already pledged a significant amount of direct 
assistance during the recent Afghanistan Conference.  Also, 
Poland already contributes through the European Union.  He 
added that the Poles are unsure how to contribute, noting 
that in Afghanistan Poland has been able to channel donations 
through the World Bank-administered Afghan Reconstruction 
Trust Fund. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Wieclaw also offered a few thoughts on relations 
between Poland and Pakistan generally.  He stated that 
relations have been limited, but in accordance with EU policy 
the Polish government is seeking to increase its cultural and 
political contacts with Pakistan.  On the economic level, 
trade between Poland and Pakistan is "modest," and the recent 
kidnapping of a Polish citizen in Pakistan is likely to 
depress interest among Poles in investing there.
