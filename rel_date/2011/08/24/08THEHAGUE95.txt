¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: MFA Iraq desk officer Dirk Jan Wierenga 
told poloff that Deputy PM Salih made a "good impression" 
during his visit to the Netherlands January 21-22.  Dutch 
agreement to a trade mission to northern Iraq later this year 
was a highlight of the visit.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Salih saw PM Balkenende and Shell officials on 
January 21, and participated in an economic seminar and 
Ministry of Economic Affairs meetings on January 22. 
According to Wierenga, the most prominent success from the 
visit may be a trade mission to northern Iraq later this 
year.  "Serious companies" are interested in the mission, 
whereas last year,s proposed mission to Irbil was canceled. 
Reviewing reports of the bilateral, Wierenga said Balkenende 
and Salih had a "good meeting," a 30-45 minute "courtesy 
call."   Salih gave a "professional and sympathetic 
impression" and "clearly had warm feelings for the 
Netherlands."   Salih appeared to be a "rational 
decision-maker." 
 
¶3. (SBU) During the bilateral, Balkenende emphasized the need 
for improved security and continuing reconciliation.  He 
emphasized that the PKK is a terrorist group, and that Iraq 
and Turkey should work together to resolve the issues.  The 
Dutch parliament is concerned about the situation of 
minorities in Iraq, and Balkenende urged Salih to improve the 
situation.  In the future, an open economy would help Iraq. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Salih noted the presence of a large Kurdish 
community in the Netherlands, and thanked the Netherlands for 
supporting the liberation of Iraq.  Salih invited Balkenende 
to visit Baghdad.  Regarding security, Salih said the 
situation was improving, though Iraq was benefiting from a 
cease fire rather than peace.  Salih agreed the PKK was a 
threat but "completely rejected" the attacks by Turkey. 
There is not a military solution to the PKK problem.  Iran is 
a security concern and a negative influence, but Iraq must 
have relations with its neighbor.  Iraq is looking for a 
long-term security agreement with the United States.  On the 
political situation, it,s key to involve Sunnis.  The 
current process is not inclusive.  With such a heterogeneous 
population, federalism and local authority is key. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On the economy, Salih sees improvements.  Iraq wants 
to reach an economic and trade agreement with the EU soon. 
Salih hopes for "soft loans" from Italy and Japan.  Iraq is 
looking also for capacity building for both the private 
sector and government in Iraq.  It,s possible that Dutch 
companies might assist in developing the harbor in Basrah. 
 
¶6.  (U)  The Dutch trade relationship with Iraq is highly 
varied and centered around oil products.  In 2006, the 
Netherlands imported 434,000 tons of oil and oil products 
from Iraq, down from a five year (2001-2006) high of 
2,178,000 tons in 2002.  According to official figures, the 
Dutch exported no products to Iraq in 2006, after exporting 
8,000 tons of oil and oil products in 2005 and 5,000 tons of 
non-oil products in 2004. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Although not one of the Netherlands' 36 official 
development assistance partner countries, Iraq receives 
significant amounts of Dutch aid.  Over the 2006-2007 period, 
the GONL provided 3.7 million euros (USD 5.3 million) to the 
UN and various NGOs for their operations in Iraq, including 
support for internally displaced persons and the medical 
sector.  The Dutch also supported Iraq indirectly, providing 
USD 57.1 million over 2006-2007 to the UN Central Emergency 
Response Fund, which allocated USD 9.7 million to the region, 
and USD 37.1 million in 2006 to the UN Children's Fund, which 
allocated USD 2.2 million to Iraq (see reftel for additional 
details).  In 2006, the Dutch agreed to forgive 80 percent of 
Iraqi debt -- in line with Paris Club terms -- and totaling 
256 million euros (USD 366.7 million).
