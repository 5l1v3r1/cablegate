KURDISH-LANGUAGE BROADCASTS 
 
REF: ANKARA 6016 
 
1.(SBU) Summary:  Officials from Turkey's Radio and 
Television Supreme Council (RTUK) praised GOT policy on 
non-Turkish language broadcasting, and downplayed criticisms 
that regulations are burdensome for start-up broadcasters. 
The RTUK also defended GOT efforts to shut down Denmark-based 
and PKK-affiliated Roj-TV, and did not see value in the 
suggestion that more Kurdish-language broadcasting would draw 
viewers away from Roj.  The RTUK told us the GOT would expand 
Kurdish-language broadcasting rights in coming years.  In an 
environment of increasing nationalism, the GOT is unlikely to 
do so prior to next year's presidential and parliamentary 
elections.   End summary. 
 
2.(SBU) During a recent meeting, officials from the Radio and 
Television Supreme Council (RTUK) praised GOT policy on 
Kurdish-language television broadcasting.  RTUK Head of 
International Relations Department Sebnem Bilget told us that 
RTUK recently abolished broadcasting time restrictions for 
Kurdish-language cultural shows or films.  She characterized 
the move as a great step forward for freedom of expression in 
Turkey.  She confirmed, however, that RTUK still limits pure 
news broadcasts to 45 minutes per day and continues to 
require non-Turkish shows to have Turkish subtitles (see 
reftel).  Bilget dismissed allegations that such regulations 
are unduly burdensome or financially onerous.  She told us 
that the RTUK treats all regional broadcasters equally, and 
noted that most countries have complex regulations governing 
broadcasting.  She also noted that broadcasting is an 
inherently expensive business. 
 
3.(SBU) Bilget and RTUK regulatory expert Nuran Yardimci 
staunchly defended the GOT's efforts to close down 
Denmark-based and PKK-affiliated Roj-TV, which most 
southeastern Kurds watch via satellite (see reftel). 
Yardimci told us that the GOT had convinced Belgium, France, 
and the UK to shut down Roj-precursors such as MED-TV, and 
were confident that their lobbying efforts would convince 
Denmark to do the same with Roj. 
 
4.(SBU) Bilget and Yardimci dismissed the suggestion that 
permitting more Kurdish language broadcasting would draw 
viewers away from Roj-TV.  Bilget said that the political 
sensitivity surrounding language rights necessitates a slow 
change.  She told us that she expects the GOT to allow more 
Kurdish-language broadcasting in the coming years. 
 
5.(SBU) Comment:  The RTUK continues to support an outdated 
policy that focuses efforts on blocking allegedly dangerous 
content in order to "protect" citizens.  In most cases, 
Turkey's Kurds can, and do, circumvent GOT regulations 
through satellite or high-speed Internet reception.  A more 
constructive policy would be to show the EU a good-faith 
effort to expand freedom of expression.  The GOT, however, is 
unlikely to liberalize broadcasting rules in the lead-up to 
next year's elections.  End comment.
