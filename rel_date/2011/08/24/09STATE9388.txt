SUBJECT: SOMALIA: PRESS STATEMENT ON SELECTING A PRESIDENT 
 
¶1. Action Request:  Department requests that USUN seek a UN 
Security Council Press Statement welcoming the election of a 
new President of the Transitional Federal Government of 
Somalia at the earliest opportunity.  USUN has the discretion 
to either circulate the statement in paragraph 2 to the 
Council for adoption or to give the statement to the British 
for inclusion in their draft statement. 
 
¶2.  Begin statement:  The members of the Security Council 
welcomed the election by the Somalia Transitional Federal 
Parliament of Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed as President of the 
Transitional Federal Government of Somalia.  The 
members of the Security Council commended the newly-expanded 
Parliament on its work in electing the new President. 
The members of the Security Council expressed their 
appreciation to all parties who contributed to this historic 
event, including the work of the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah and the support 
by President Ismail Omar Guelleh of Djibouti. 
 
The members of the Security Council expressed their strong 
support for the peace process and for this important step 
towards a political settlement in Somalia.  To this end, 
Council members called upon President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh 
Ahmed to constitute a Government of National Unity.  Council 
members called on all Somalis to support the Transitional 
Federal Institutions as peace and reconciliation efforts go 
forward.  The Council strongly condemned terrorist 
organization al-Shabab, in particular, for continuing to 
target the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). 
 
The members of the Security Council commended AMISOM for its 
important work.  Council members expressed their concern 
regarding the humanitarian situation in Somalia and condemned 
violence directed at civilians, AMISOM and humanitarian 
personnel. End statement.
