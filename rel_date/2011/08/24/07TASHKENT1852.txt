¶1. (SBU) Ambassador made a courtesy call on the Uzbek 
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, Elyor 
Ganiev, on October 23.  The GOU now is granting the 
Ambassador meetings with officials approximately once a week. 
 Ganiev reiterated a number of points expressed at his 
meeting with Charge in September (ref A), including the 
continued "impressive" growth of the Uzbek economy, 
Uzbekistan's desire to attract technological investment, and 
the open and profitable investment climate Uzbekistan offers 
foreign investors. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ganiev believes that the recent GM-DAT joint venture 
with UzDaewoo (ref B) will send a signal to other investors 
that Uzbekistan has great potential, is a good place for U.S. 
investment and is a serious partner.  It also sends a signal, 
he said, that large U.S. companies can invest in Central Asia 
for the long term. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ambassador raised the importance of expanding the 
electricity supply to Afghanistan.  Ganiev said the Uzbek 
side needs more concrete information, such as the total costs 
involved in building and how much Uzbekistan will receive for 
the electricity, as "Uzbekistan will not export for less than 
the cost" to provide.  He also said Uzbekistan is quickly 
growing and needs to improve its own energy supply, however 
they "have not closed the door to cooperation, but we need 
more concrete information."
