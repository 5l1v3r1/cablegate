¶1. (SBU) On September 28, 2005, the Minister of Commerce and 
Industry, Maqbool bin Ali Sultan, transmitted a letter, via 
facsimile, to the Embassy for transmission to Robert Portman, 
United States Trade Representative. 
 
(Begin letter text) 
 
Please accept my congratulations on your recent appointment 
to serve as the United States Trade Representative. 
 
It has come to my attention that questions have arisen 
regarding Oman's participation in the Arab Boycott of Israel. 
 I would like to assure you that Oman does not apply any 
aspect of the boycott, whether primary, secondary or tertiary 
or have any laws to that effect.  Oman has no restriction 
whatsoever on U.S. companies trading with Oman or doing 
business with Oman, regardless of its ownership or relations 
with Israeli companies, and the Government is taking steps to 
ensure that all Ministries are aware of the situation and 
remove any boycott language that may unintentionally remain 
in their contacts. 
 
As a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Oman did 
not invoke the non-application provisions of the WTO 
Agreement toward any other Member, and therefore has all WTO 
rights and obligations with respect to all Members. 
 
(End letter text) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and 
Commerce and Industry have repeatedly assured Emboffs that 
Oman employs no boycotts on Israel and expressed hopes that 
the Commerce Minister's letter will finally put these 
questions to rest.  Emboffs and visiting officials from the 
Department of Commerce's Antiboycott Compliance Office 
recently called on two local entities that had recently 
employed boycott language in their tender contracts, winning 
assurances from them that the boycott language was 
inadvertent and would be removed (reftel). 
 
¶3. (SBU) While Oman, which hosted an Israeli trade mission 
until September 2000, has consistently disavowed any boycott 
on trade with Israel, Minister Responsible for Foreign 
Affairs Yusuf bin Alawi stated to the press on October 3 that 
conditions were not yet suitable for reopening that mission. 
He added, however, that "there is no room for boycotts... 
anymore."
