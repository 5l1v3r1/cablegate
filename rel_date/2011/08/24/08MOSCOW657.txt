¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a Pre-license check to determine 
the legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, 
Advanced Technology Ltd, Moscow, Russia. The company 
is listed on BIS license application D390646 as the 
ultimate consignee of fingerprint powders, dyes and 
inks. These items are controlled for crime control 
reasons under ECCN 1A985. The licensee is Sirchie 
Acquisition Company LLC, 100 Hunter Place,

Liston and LES Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested pre-license check at the offices of A-Tec 
(dba Advanced Technologies & Forensic Solutions), 
Inc., M. Yushunskaya st., 1-1, 117303, Moscow, Russia, 
Office tel. number: +7-495-319-8420/21/22. The export 
control team met with Sergey Narutov, General 
Director. 
 
 
 
¶4.  Sergey Narutov, General Director of A-Tec provided 
the Moscow Export Control Team with an overview of his 
business and advised that he has an Exclusive 
Representation Agreement signed with Sirchie, whereas 
he is the sole Sirchie representative to the Russian 
Federal and most of the Former Soviet Bloc countries. 
Sergey Narutov gave the Export Control Team a copy of 
the Representation Certificate, dated June 30, 2007. 
Sergey Narutov advised the Export Control Team that he 
bids on government tenders, and if he is awarded the 
tender he places an order with Sirchie and in most 
cases has the product shipped directly to the Ministry 
of Interior of the end-user country after being 
cleared Russian customs by Advanced Technologies, A- 
Tec's partner/customs broker.  A-Tec had limited 
storage facilities on site, however, what they do have 
is secured. 
 
¶5.  The items in reftel are consistent with subject's 
business.  There is no indication that A-Tec is 
involved in chemical, biological, nuclear or missile 
programs.  The Export Control Team did not detect any 
possible connections to state-sponsored or other 
terrorist organizations. 
 
¶6. Recommendations: Post recommends A-Tec, Inc., 
Moscow, Russia, as reliable recipients of sensitive 
U.S. origin commodities. It is requested that post be 
notified of final disposition of the application, and 
of any shipments for this organization in order to 
conduct appropriate FCS follow-up and statistical 
reporting.
