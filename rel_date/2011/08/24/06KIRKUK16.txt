SUBJECT: (SBU) POLITICAL ROUNDTABLE BRINGS PARTIES TOGETHER IN SALAH 
AD DIN PROVINCE 
 
(U) Sensitive But Unclassifed.  Not for distribution by internet. 
 
¶1. (U) This is a SET Tikrit cable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Several political parties in Salah Ad Din 
Province meet weekly to develop political cohesiveness in the 
province.  The group is showing an amazing unity of purpose 
during its first two months in existence.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------- 
(U) BACKGROUND 
-------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) On January 24, 2006, the Political Roundtable of Salah 
Ad Din Province met in Tikrit.  This committee began in November 
2005 as a place for political entities in Salah Ad Din to work 
together to find common ground and discuss differences.  The SET 
and Provincial Governor's spokesman developed the concept, and 
the spokesman contacted the 37 political entities to seek their 
participation.  After a bumpy start, the committee seems to be 
gaining momentum. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Although all 37 groups were invited, about 12 are 
consistent attendees.  The Iraqi Islamic Party (IIP) and the 
Iraqi Turcoman Front (ITF) offer the most opinions.  However, 
groups representing Shia Arabs, Kurds, and Christians also 
attend and participate. 
 
------------ 
(U) PROGRESS 
------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) At the January 24 meeting, the group elected a 
president and secretary from among those nominated or 
self-nominated.  The new roundtable president is not a party 
member, but the Dean of the Tikrit University Law School.  Dr. 
Amer has been at the university for over 15 years, and was the 
acting roundtable leader for the first two months. (COMMENT: it 
was hard to tell if he was elected because of what he could 
bring to the group, or because he had stepped forward in the 
beginning to lead the group and had not stepped on many toes 
during the first months. END COMMENT.) 
 
¶6. (SBU) This meeting focused on the national government and the 
future provincial council elections.  Other than selecting the 
president, the group took only one vote, and the outcome was 
unanimous: to support the incoming government.  (COMMENT: With 
the variety of people in the room, this was no small task.  END 
COMMENT). 
 
¶7. (SBU) A Christian man (no further info) said he felt that 
Christians will be overwhelmed in the national Council of 
Representatives.  Several people in the group disagreed, saying 
the individual is important and can make a difference.  This 
moved the discussion to the provincial elections, where most in 
the room agreed they should set up a unified list to ensure 
fairness in the new provincial council.  These discussions led 
to a few minutes of patriotism, with everyone hoping for one 
Iraq, and discussing the need to take the corruption out of the 
provincial council.  They want a council that works for the 
average citizen, not for council members themselves. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The discussion of a unified list took on great 
importance.  The discussions were about how to divide the seats, 
and what type of people each party should nominate, including 
one suggestion to offer slots to national election-nominees who 
were not selected.  Then, as the discussion turned to tribes, 
the group realized they would need to educate voters, so that 
there would be less reliance on tribal leadership as the sole 
vote influencer. 
 
----------- 
(U) COMMENT 
----------- 
 
¶9. (SBU)  This committee is taking an interesting turn.  Where 
SET expected to see sharp divisions develop early, the groups 
are in fact working together.  They do voice some different 
opinions; however, their vision of a coalition list seems like a 
sophisticated approach to the problem of corruption in the 
current provincial council.   They feel that this approach will 
have more transparency than might otherwise be seen.  On the 
other hand, so far nothing controversial has come to the 
committee, so there has not been a major disagreement.  As the 
provincial council elections approach and the group needs to 
stand together in public to show unity, there may be some 
breaking of the ranks.  The mood among the political leaders is 
that of a cooperative public forum, but it remains to be seen

whether their constituents will support this type of consensus.
