SUBJECT: SUHARTO: FORMER PRESIDENT IN CRITICAL BUT STABLE 
CONDITION 
 
REF: EMBASSY JAKARTA - OPS-CENTER TELCONS 1/5/2008 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Former Indonesian President Suharto remains 
hospitalized in critical but stable condition after his 
physical condition deteriorated sharply on Saturday, January 
¶5.  The media and public are closely following his condition. 
 Suharto's supporters have called for the Indonesian 
government to halt an outstanding corruption case against 
him; opponents have rejected the appeal.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (SBU) RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL:  Former Indonesian President 
Suharto was hospitalized late Friday, January 4, after 
complaining of severe fatigue for several days.  For several 
hours Suharto's life appeared to hang in the balance as his 
blood circulation to vital organs became sharply impaired. 
After visiting Suharto on January 5, President Yudhoyono 
appeared on television and told the nation former president's 
condition was critical.  A parade of Indonesia's political 
elite visited him in the hospital. 
 
¶3. (SBU) STABILIZED:  A team of 40 physicians treated the 
86-year old former ruler throughout the weekend for anemia 
and severe edema (swelling of internal organs).  After a 
blood transfusion and dialysis, Suharto's condition improved 
but was still listed as critical.  He is now reportedly able 
to communicate, but doctors have kept him on medication and 
may install a new pacemaker.  He remains in intensive care at 
Jakarta's Pertamina Hospital. 
 
¶4. (SBU) A HISTORY OF AILMENTS:  The aging Suharto has 
battled a string of illnesses since leaving power in 1998. 
In July 1999, he suffered the first of a series of strokes, 
and doctors installed a pacemaker in 2001 to correct an 
irregular heartbeat.  He has also suffered from intestinal 
bleeding, hypertension and chronic anemia.  In 2006, 
Suharto's lawyers blocked an attempt to prosecute him for 
corruption by arguing that he was too ill to stand trial. 
 
¶5. (SBU) CIVIL SUIT HANGS IN BALANCE:  The Indonesian media 
has covered Suharto's current illness in great detail and 
many public figures, including some former political 
adversaries, have spoken warmly of his contributions to the 
nation.  Agung Laksono, Speaker of the National Assembly 
(DPR) and Chairman of the Golkar party, which Suharto 
created, has called on the government to drop a civil case 
against Suharto.  (Note: While a criminal case against 
Suharto was halted in 2006, a civil case continues seeking to 
recover $1.4 billion in state funds allegedly diverted to his 
private foundation, Supersemar.)  Former president 
Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur) rejected the appeal and called 
upon the Attorney General to continue the civil case.
