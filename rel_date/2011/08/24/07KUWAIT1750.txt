SUBJECT: KUWAIT SPORTS ENVOY PROGRAM REQUEST 
 
REF: STATE 153793 
 
¶1. Per reftel, Embassy Kuwait submits the following program request 
for American NBA and WNBA sports envoys to come to Kuwait to conduct 
a basketball program for Kuwaiti youth. Basketball is a popular 
sport in Kuwait that can be played year round indoors. Note: Due to 
strict separation of male and female sports in Kuwait, there should 
be one male and one female envoy. 
 
¶2. Objectives and Relation to MPP Goals: The program will be geared 
toward non-elite Kuwaiti youth who comprise a key target audience 
for Embassy efforts to counter extremism, foster democratic ideals, 
and increase awareness of American values.  It supports MSP goal #4 
"Expand Kuwaiti and American professional and social ties based on 
shared core values" and goal #6 "Strengthening democracy, including 
the role of parliament, rule of law, and equality for women." The 
program's chief objective is to share American values and promote 
cooperation through American team sports. Additionally the program 
can be a platform to promote study at American colleges and 
universities, a key Embassy objective.  By including Kuwaiti 
females, the program will highlight women's equality in all sectors 
of society. By fostering ties between Americans and Kuwaitis, it 
will present an ideal opportunity to advance understanding of the 
U.S. among Kuwaitis and to build bridges between Americans and the 
Mission with non-elite Kuwaiti youth and locally-based institutions. 
By promoting the clinics in the local print and broadcast media, 
these messages can be amplified to other Kuwaitis, especially its 
youth. 
 
¶3. Partner Institutions and Audiences: Public Affairs Kuwait will 
organize this program with two local NGOs, AMIDEAST and LoYAC, as 
well as with the Kuwaiti Public Authority for Youth and Sports. 
AMIDEAST is an organization that offers English Language instruction 
to students in Kuwait. LoYAC is a youth oriented NGO that offers 
program to young people to encourage tolerance, an appreciation for 
the arts, and social activism.
