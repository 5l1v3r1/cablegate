SUBJECT: INDONESIA IPR UPDATE -- AUGUST 22, 2006 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Indonesian Government (GOI) officials are 
gearing up for another meeting of the National IPR Task 
Force.  The Ministry of Industry (MOI) sent a letter to 
optical disc factories warning them that unannounced 
inspections will soon begin.  A new DOJ-ICITAP senior 
technical advisor has come on board and agreed with the MOI 
on an operation plan for the next year.  Indonesia's Police 
Chief and Minister of Justice have teamed up to make an anti- 
piracy video clip.  End Summary. 
 
National Task Force Moving Forward 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ministry of Trade Director for Bilateral 
Cooperation I Sondang Anggraini told us that a National 
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Task Force working level 
group met on August 14 and planned to meet again in 
preparation for the Task Force's quarterly Echelon 1 
(Director General level) meeting in early September. 
Anggraini said that working level members have produced IPR 
action plans for their respective ministries.  They will 
report progress to the Task Force's cabinet level members 
every six months.  While Anggraini apparently had copies of 
the action plans with her, she did not share them with us. 
She explained that some members of the Task Force felt 
strongly that there should be more Indonesian ownership of 
IPR enforcement, and that they wished to avoid the 
perception that the Task Force was U.S.-led. 
 
Monitoring Team Warns Factories 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) MOI Directorate General for Chemical, Agriculture 
and Forestry Based Industry Director Tony Tanduk provided us 
with a copy of an August 15 letter he sent to Indonesia's 27 
registered optical disk (OD) factories.  As promised, the 
letter warns factories that the OD Factory Monitoring team 
will soon begin periodic and unannounced factory visits in 
accordance with the GOI's 2004 optical disk regulations. 
The letter notes that the MOI expects the factories to 
cooperate with the inspections and provide the Monitoring 
Team with relevant production documents. 
 
¶4. (SBU) One of two State Department-funded, DOJ-ICITAP IPR 
senior technical advisors began work at the beginning of 
August.  The advisor has recently reached agreement with the 
MOI Tony Tanduk on an operation plan for working with the 
MOI OD Factory Monitoring Team.  The plan calls for further 
training, database improvements, a revised monitoring 
checklist, and the establishment of monitoring teams in key 
cities outside Jakarta.  Jakarta and regional-based 
recording industry (IFPI) representatives met on August 16 
with DOJ-ICITAP directors, Econ officer, the DOJ-ICITAP 
monitoring team senior technical advisor, and the candidate 
for a second DOJ-ICITAP IPR senior technical advisor 
position with the police. 
 
Police Chief/Justice Minister Make Anti-Piracy Video 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) We reviewed a short Indonesian language anti-piracy 
video clip that is expected to be aired on television in the 
coming months.  The video includes Indonesia's Minister of 
Justice and Police Chief explaining that piracy is illegal 
and noting the ill effects it is having on Indonesia's 
artists and investment climate.  The video also includes a 
segment in which a Muslim cleric explains that piracy is 
forbidden under Islamic law.
