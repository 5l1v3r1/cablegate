¶1.  (SBU) Summary: At least two separate USG-directed visits 
will survey Moroccan biosecurity and biosafety legislation, 
regulation, infrastructure and competence in late 2008. 
Moroccan authorities welcome these separate visits and 
additional opportunities to cooperate on biosecurity and 
biosafety, which come at a time when they are in the process 
of setting up their national biosecurity regime.  Separately, 
Morocco is also seeking a leading role in regional efforts to 
improve and coordinate biosecurity and biosafety standards in 
the Middle East and North Africa, and is beginning 
collaboration with EU nations to guide its own progress.  We 
may have an opportunity to influence at an early stage 
Morocco's international efforts and promote 
biosafety/biosecurity to a broader audience.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------- 
We're Reaching Out to Morocco... 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Post is currently assisting ISN/CTR and the 
Moroccan National Institute of Health (INH) to arrange a 
conference in Rabat for Moroccan officials and professionals 
on biosafety and biosecurity on November 3 - 5, 2008 under 
the Biosecurity Engagement Program (BEP).  Moroccan 
officials, including INH Director Rajae El Aouad, and 
Director of Technology Zayer El Majid at the Ministry of 
National Education and Scientific Research, are enthusiastic 
about the conference and potential follow-on training. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Ministry of National Education alerted us to a 
second USG visit that is scheduled for October 13 - 17.  Two 
experts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the 
Centers for Disease Control are expected to discuss 
capabilities and preparedness in biosafety and biosecurity 
with Moroccan interlocutors under the aegis of the office of 
Policy and Global Affairs of the National Academy of Science 
(NAS), in a visit that is being coordinated by the Ministry 
of National Education. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
While Morocco Shapes its National Regime, 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) El Majid and his colleague Khalid Temsamani, 
National Coordinator of Materials Science at the Ministry of 
National Education and Scientific Research, told Econoff on 
August 11 that Morocco is working now to implement its own 
national biosecurity regime.  The country's Council of 
Government intends to take up in its September 8 meeting a 
decision to create a "Biosecurity Committee" (and a sister 
"Bioethics Committee") of which the Ministry of Higher 
Education and Scientific Research will be the lead agency. 
After the committee is established, Morocco will begin its 
process of promulgating biosecurity regulations.  The 
Ministry's vision is to follow international best practices 
in developing Morocco's own regulations and practices.  The 
Ministry has agreements in place with the European Union to 
identify partner countries to assist and model their 
regulations and practices for Morocco, starting in November 
¶2008. 
 
-------------------------------- 
And Reaches Out to its Neighbors 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Temsamani noted that Morocco intends to use its 
progress in the implementation of a biosafety/biosecurity 
strategy as a model for other Middle East/North Africa (MENA) 
states, and that it is seeking to take a leading role in 
regional efforts to address the issue.  El Majid and 
Temsamani outlined Morocco's ongoing and future participation 
in a MENA initiative on biosafety and biosecurity.  Temsamani 
 
RABAT 00000755  002 OF 002 
 
 
told us that Morocco first participated in a February 2007 
round table discussion on dual use life science technologies 
organized for MENA countries by the U.S.'s National Science 
Advisory Board on Biotechnology (NSABB - located in the 
National Institutes of Health, Office of Biotechnology 
Activity). 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The NSABB roundtable was followed by the "Biosafety 
and Biosecurity International 2007" conference in Abu Dhabi, 
an initiative apparently spearheaded by the Washington-based 
International Council for Life Sciences (ICLS) along with the 
Environment Agency of Abu Dhabi.  Morocco will host the 
follow-on "Biosafety and Biosecurity International 2009" 
conference in Casablanca in April 2009.  In preparation for 
the 2009 conference, Morocco convened in May 2008 a "core 
group" of participating countries to draft a biosafety and 
biosecurity strategy for the MENA region.  Temsamani, who is 
is Morocco's national coordinator for this international 
collaboration, was unable to provide the draft to us as it 
will not be released until the April 2009 conference, but was 
open to exploring possibilities for USG-Moroccan cooperation 
surrounding the event. 
 
----------------- 
Looking for Money 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Temsamani noted that Morocco anticipates a budget 
of USD 330,000 for the April 2009 conference, with only a 
portion covered by his Ministry and the governments of the 
UAE and Jordan.  He intends to request funding from the 
Islamic Development Bank, and the Islamic Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO).  Temsamani 
asked us if the USG could consider financially sponsoring the 
Biosafety and Biosecurity International 2009 conference as 
well, and stated that he and El Majid would coordinate with 
Morocco's foreign ministry regarding an official request. 
 
-------- 
Comment: 
-------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Morocco's efforts to get its biosecurity house in 
order and position itself as a regional leader suggest an 
opportunity to leverage our involvement and capabilities 
under the ISN/CTR BEP model to influence a broader MENA 
audience in promoting biosecurity and biosafety.  With a 
November 2008 kickoff to BEP activities and the proposed 
rollout in April 2009 of the draft strategy, we would need to 
work quickly to engage both the Moroccan entities and other 
countries involved in the international effort.  We at post 
are unfamiliar with the overall goals of the Biosecurity and 
Biosafety International conference, and those of the ICLS, 
its organizer.  Other conference participants in the 2007 and 
presumably 2009 conferences include agencies from Syria and 
Iran, so there may be additional sensitivities and limits to 
how far the USG could engage.  However, this conference may 
be an opportunity to rapidly expand our biosecurity 
engagement efforts beyond Morocco, a possibility ISN/CTR and 
other visitors may wish to explore with their Moroccan 
counterparts during their upcoming visits.  End Comment.
