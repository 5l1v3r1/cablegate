SUBJECT: NOVEMBER 1 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: DALAI LAMA, BURMA, 
SIX-PARTY TALKS, IRAN, TIBETAN REFUGEES, GATES VISIT 
 
¶1. Key points at the November 1 MFA Press Briefing: 
 
-- Countries that meet with the Dalai Lama have been deceived 
or wish to meddle in the internal affairs of China.  Seeking 
to undermine China's policy of peaceful development in Tibet 
is doomed to failure. 
 
-- China hopes the relevant parties in Burma will show 
restraint and hold dialogue to realize national 
reconciliation.  China supports UN Special Envoy  Gambari's 
mediation efforts. 
 
-- VFM Wu Dawei met separately with A/S Chris Hill and Kim 
Kye-Gwan to discuss the next phase of work in the Six-Party 
Talks. 
 
--  The P5 plus 1 will meet in London on November 2 to 
discuss Iran.  China supports a peaceful solution to the 
Iranian nuclear issue achieved through negotiation. 
 
-- China denies allegations that Chinese police shot at 
Tibetan refugees fleeing for Nepal on October 18. 
 
-- VISITS: U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates will visit 
China November 4-6.  He will hold consultations on regional 
and international security.  China hopes that the visit, a 
"big military event," will improve mutual understanding and 
trust.  At the invitation of Premier Wen Jiabao, Slovenian 
Prime Minister Janez Jansa will visit China November 8-11. 
 
Tibet and the Dalai Lama 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. At the November 1 regular MFA press briefing, MFA 
Spokesman Liu Jianchao said other countries' meetings with 
the Dalai Lama are "hard to understand."  These meetings take 
place either because the countries have been deceived by the 
Dalai Lama or because they wish to meddle in China's internal 
affairs.  Such meddling will not change anything, he said. 
Liu said the Chinese government adheres to a policy of 
building a harmonious and prosperous Tibet and that there are 
rumors that some anti-Chinese forces seek to undermine 
Tibetan development.  Such efforts are "doomed to failure." 
Concerning the Pope's plan to meet with the Dalai Lama in 
December, Liu expressed hope that the Vatican would not "hurt 
the feelings of the Chinese people," and would take steps to 
improve its relationship with China.  Asked for specifics of 
how meetings with the Dalai Lama had hurt the relationships 
between China and other countries, including the United 
States, Liu responded that such meetings "deeply harm the 
image of the relevant countries in the hearts of the Chinese 
people." 
 
Burma and Gambari 
----------------- 
 
¶3. Asked about Chinese pressure on Burma and the upcoming 
Burma trip of UN Special Envoy to Burma Ibrahim Gambari, Liu 
said China has normal relations with Burma and hopes that the 
relevant parties exercise restraint and hold dialogue to 
solve problems and realize national reconciliation.  Gambari 
will go to Burma on November 3.  China supports Gambari's 
mediation efforts and hopes they produce positive result. 
 
Update on Six Party Talks 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei met separately with both 
U.S. Assistant Secretary Chris Hill and North Korean Vice 
Foreign Minister Kim Kye-Gwan to exchange ideas on the next 
phase work of the Six-Party Talks.  A team of U.S. experts 
has already gone to North Korea to work on disablement of 
nuclear facilities.  The third meeting of the Economic and 
Energy Cooperation Working Group convened in the Republic of 
Korea and a delegation from the Ministry of Commerce and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs attended.  China hopes that all 
parties "implement their commitments in earnest to implement 
actions for the second phase in a comprehensive and balanced 
manner."

Iran 
---- 
 
¶5. Asked about the November 2 P5 plus 1 Political Directors' 
meeting on Iran in London, Liu said that China upholds the 
principles of nonproliferation and supports diplomatic 
negotiations to resolve the issue peacefully.  China has 
actively participated in the UN and in other meetings on 
Iran.  Six countries will meet in London November 2.  The 
Chinese representative will be MFA Director General of the 
Department of Arms Control Zhang Yan.  China hopes all 
relevant parties will make efforts for a peaceful solution 
through negotiation and supports consultations between Iran 
and the IAEA and between Iran and the EU-3. 
 
China: Not Shooting Fleeing Refugees 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. Asked about allegations made by an American NGO, the 
International Campaign for Tibet, that Chinese police had 
shot at Tibetan refugees attempting to flee to Nepal on 
October 18, Liu said that he had checked with the relevant 
authorities, who confirmed that the allegations are 
groundless and fabricated. 
 
Visits 
------ 
 
¶7. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates will visit China 
November 4-6, during which time he will hold consultations 
and dialogue on matters related to regional and international 
security.  China hopes the visit, a "big military event," 
will improve mutual understanding and trust.  At the 
invitation of Premier Wen Jiabao, Slovenian Prime Minister 
Janez Jansa will visit China November 8-11.
