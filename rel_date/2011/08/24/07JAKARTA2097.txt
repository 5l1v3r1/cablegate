¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: On July 23 Government of Indonesian (GOI) 
law enforcement authorities conducted the largest seizure 
ever of counterfeit pharmaceuticals.  Jakarta police raided a 
warehouse seizing over 16 million finished tablets of 
counterfeit pharmaceuticals valued between $3 and $7 million. 
  This latest seizure took place only three days after 
authorities seized over one hundred and fifty 50 kg bags of 
drugs in a separate raid (reftel C) and less than a month 
after police closed down two optical disk factories suspected 
of illegal production on July 1 (reftel B). END SUMMARY 
 
Imported Counterfeit Medicines 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU)   Indonesian police raided a warehouse in Jakarta 
serving as a distribution center for imported counterfeit 
medicines on July 23.  Authorities seized 16 million finished 
tablets of counterfeit pharmaceuticals, fifty thousand 
capsules and almost 1000 syrup bottles.  Police estimated the 
value of the counterfeit medicines at between $3 and $7 
million.  GOI officials contend this is the largest 
counterfeit drug seizure ever worldwide.  Evidence collected 
from the site by investigators confirmed the counterfeit 
product was destined for three well-known Jakarta 
pharmaceutical retailers for domestic sale.  Much like 
previous raids, the medicines were packaged with brand-name 
corporate markings, including Pfizer, GalxoSmithKline, Bauer 
and Roche.  Police investigators suspect the medicines were 
imported from China, but results of the investigation are not 
definitive.  The owner of the premises fled the scene and 
police authorities believe he has departed the country for 
China. 
 
U.S. Technical Assistance Draws Private Sector Support 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Law enforcement authorities benefited from 
intelligence and technical assistance provided through the 
State Department/INL-funded, Department of Justice 
International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance 
Program (ICITAP).  ICITAP advisors, in addition to providing 
training and assistance, also successfully persuaded a 
consortium of pharmaceutical manufacturers to fund sample 
testing of the seized medicines.  The pharmaceutical 
companies have also agreed to finance construction of a 
storage facility for seized goods. 
 
 
Investigation May Extend to Importation 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  This latest counterfeit drug raid follows a 
impressive string of successful intellectual property rights 
(IPR) related enforcement actions by Indonesian authorities. 
ICITAP advisors tell us that if test results by 
pharmaceutical companies show the counterfeit medicines posed 
significant health risks to consumers, law enforcement 
authorities may broaden the investigation to include the 
importation of the drugs into Indonesia, potentially 
implicating GOI Customs officials.  Post continues to 
recommend increased support of IPR-related assistance to the 
GOI, including extension of the ICITAP program for another 
year and development of DOJ/OPDAT assistance to the Attorney 
General's Office to ensure successful prosecutions.
