2007 AGOA Forum to Senegal's Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Commerce 
and Finance.  In addition, the Economic Office briefed Mr. Abdoulaye 
Dieye, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director for Europe and the

Foreign Trade Division.  The GOS is aware of the upcoming AGOA Forum 
in Accra, and plans to send a high-level delegation.  However, the 
actual representation will likely not be known until after Senegal's 
June 3 legislative elections and the cabinet reshuffle that is 
widely expected to follow.
