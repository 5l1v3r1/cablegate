¶1.  (U)  Tanzania views the draft text of a UN Security 
Council resolution on Lebanon as including some crucial 
elments but "not perfect,"  Ambassador Liberata Mulamula, 
Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Multilateral 
Division, told Poloff August 7.  Mulamula said the elements 
of an immediate cessation of hostilities, the allowance for 
the delivery of humanitarian assistance, a ceasefire and 
provision of time for the Security Council to assess the 
situation on the ground were all important.  Mulamula added 
that Tanzania wanted a SC resolution "adopted yesterday" and 
wanted to inject a sense of urgency.  Mulamula added that the 
text is "a bit imbalanced" and cited the example of reference 
to the release of two soldiers rather than addressing the 
release of all being held in both Israel and Lebanon. 
 
¶2.  (U)  COMMENT:  Tanzania has not yet voiced its 
endorsement of the UNSCR on Lebanon, but all comments point 
toward support, especially given Tanzania's desire for swift 
action by the SC.  Mulamula told Poloff August 7 that 
Minister of Foreign Affairs will review the draft text today 
but at COB still had not provided a definitive response.
