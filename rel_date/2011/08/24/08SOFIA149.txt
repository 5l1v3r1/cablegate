Â¶1.  (U)  We delivered REFTEL points to MFA's Kamen Velichkov, 
Head of the UN and Global Issues Department on March 12. 
Velichkov welcomed the appointment of Norwegian Political 
Director Kai Eide as UNSG Special Representative for 
Afghanistan.  Velichkov noted that Eide enjoyed a good 
reputation in Bulgaria and the Balkans when he was a UN 
Special Envoy to Kosovo and as a UN Special Representative to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Velichkov took the opportunity to 
express Bulgaria's aspiration to host a UN Department of 
Political Affairs (DPA) field office for peace building.  He 
cited Bulgaria's geopolitical location in the Balkans and 
proximity to the Caucuses, as well as its good relations with 
countries in these regions as factors in Bulgaria's favor.
