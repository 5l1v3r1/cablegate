Industry Exports Down

¶3. (U)  On February 4, Minister of Industry Afif Chelbi acknowledged 
that Tunisian industrial exports are beginning to be affected by the 
international economic crisis.  Speaking before an elite group of 
Tunisian graduates of the top universities in France, he said that 
January figures show that exports are down for the third consecutive 
month.  He added that January's exports suffered an 8 percent 
decrease compared with the same month in 2008. 
 
¶4. (U)  Meanwhile, the state budget forecast a growth rate of only 8 
percent in Tunisia's global exports, down from the 20.7 percent 
recorded in 2008.

GOT To Boost Maritime and Air Transport 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  On January 28 President Ben Ali chaired a cabinet meeting 
that announced a number of decisions aimed at developing Tunisia's 
maritime and air transport sectors: 
 
-- Liberalization of air links with Arab, European and American 
countries. 
 
-- Upgrading of ports infrastructure. 
 
-- The opening of all domestic airports to all Tunisian air carrier 
companies, whether public or private. 
 
-- Development and implementation of training programs for pilots, 
aircraft technicians and maritime professionals.   For this purpose, 
the Borj El Amri aviation school will be adapted to host pilot 
training.  Starting in October 2009, the naval academy will host a 
merchant marine training institute. 
 
-- A five-year tax exemption on profits for the majority state-owned 
Tunisair, which is in the midst of a fleet renewal program. 
 
-- The targeting of an increase in the national sea fleet's share of 
transportation of goods from its current 9 percent to 20 percent by 
¶2016. 
 
-- A five-year tax exemption on profits for private shipping 
companies, in addition to a 50 percent decrease in port taxes.
