The dailies report that Palestinian President Abbas underwent 
angioplasty at a Jordanian hospital on April 01.  Palestinian 
Presidency Spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudayna confirmed that Abbas is 
doing fine and will return to the Palestinian Territories on May 2. 
Related coverage on the front pages, highlights Abbas' comments to 
official Palestinian TV that, "we support all Egyptian efforts 
[regarding a truce and internal reconciliation] without 
reservation."  Citing AFP, the dailies highlight that Abbas received 
a telephone call from senior Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar, who 
wanted to, "make sure that Abbas is doing well."  The dailies said 
that no further details were revealed about their conversation. 
 
Positive coverage appears on the front pages regarding the May 2 
donors' conference in London.  Al-Quds headlines that Secretary Rice 
stated en route to London that, "Israel should present painful and 
difficult compromises in the interest of its security [sic]."  The 
dailies highlight that Rice confirmed that efforts are being made to 
attract American business investment to East Jerusalem and the West 
Bank. 
 
Separate coverage on the front pages of the dailies highlight three 
new Israeli conditions for a proposed truce with the Palestinians. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports that the new conditions could torpedo the 
truce. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mekel listed the conditions as: 
militant organizations must stop firing rockets and mortars at 
southern Israel, attacks inside Israel and along the Israeli-Gaza 
border must cease and weapons smuggling into Gaza must end. 
According to Al-Ayyam, Israeli Interior Minister Shitreet said, "We 
refuse any truce with Hamas."  The dailies report that Egyptian 
President Mubarak discussed with Israeli Premier Olmert, on May 2, 
ongoing efforts for a truce. 
 
Citing Haaretz, the front page of Al-Quds reported that Israeli 
Minister of Infrastructure gave the "green light" for five new water 
projects in West Bank settlements. 
 
The dailies reported that an Al-Qassam Hamas activist and an elderly 
man were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.  According to the 
coverage, the Israeli military conducted a wide-scale operation in 
Gaza on May 1 that resulted in extensive agricultural damage. 
Related coverage on Al Quds front page highlights that Israeli 
authorities have tightened the closure on the West Bank. 
 
The front pages of the dailies report on protests and gatherings 
throughout the West Bank and Gaza marking "Worker's Day".  Al Quds 
and Al Hayat Al Jadida run photos of flag-waving demonstrators in 
Ramallah and demonstrators in Gaza holding banners calling for an 
end to the Israeli blockade and blaming the "occupation" for high 
unemployment.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida further reports that Palestinian 
President Abbas has called for a general workers conference. 
 
According to an opinion poll conducted by Near East Consulting, 
Fatah's popularity among Palestinians is rising.  Most Palestinians 
also support a truce with Israel.  Moreover, most Palestinians 
support early presidential and legislative elections. 
 
The front pages of the three dailies report that Israeli Prime 
Minister Olmert will be questioned by police regarding allegations 
of bribery.  Olmert is a suspect in several corruption scandals 
involving property deals and questionable political appointments,

BLOCK QUOTES:

¶1.  Independent Al-Quds runs its daily editorial entitled 
"Palestinian workers on their day" (5/02):  "It is important during 
the celebration of international workers' day to recommit to the 
importance of development projects for industry, agriculture, 
tourism and infrastructure that allow our people new opportunities 
for the employment of thousands of unemployed Palestinians.  It is 
not enough to give small amounts of monthly aid to families.  Rather 
they should be brought back into the work force to provide them with 
continuous work that ensures dignity.  This is a core duty that 
should be among the top priorities of the Palestinian 
Authorities'... future economic plans.  In this regard, we should 
value the development plan that has been adopted by the government 
of Dr. Salam Fayyad, and we wait to see its outcome..." 
 
¶2.  Independent Al-Ayyam runs an op-ed by veteran columnist Samih 
Shbaib, entitled "The [nakba's] catastrophes' sixth anniversary" 
(5/02):  "...the commemoration of the catastrophe, is for us, 
Palestinians, a marker of the separation of human beings from their 
land and creation of a new situation where most Palestinians have 
become refugees in Arab states and the diaspora... Israel is a state 
that was established by international law, and by a clear violation 
of the principles of human rights... Israel has also created laws 
that aggravate the refugee problem and have eroded refugee's basic 
rights..."
