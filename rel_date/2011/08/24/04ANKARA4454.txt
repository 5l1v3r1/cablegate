¶1. (SBU) PolMilOff followed up on ref a demarche Aug. 6 with 
MFA Iraq Department Chief Mehmet Kemal Bozay, who called our 
attention to the OIC Secretary General's Aug. 2 statement 
condemning the recent church bombings in Iraq (ref c).  Bozay 
had made it clear in our initial discussion on this issue 
(ref b), that he saw merit in the OIC issuing statements 
condemning terrorism in Iraq. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: The Turkish government, or at least its MFA 
apparatus which deals with Iraq, is seized with the recent 
murder and kidnapping of Turkish workers in Iraq.  The GOT is 
directly feeling the effects of this kind of terrorism and 
will continue to condemn it.  End comment. 
 
¶3. (U) Baghdad minimize considered.
