¶1. (U) Approximately 100 armed Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) 
troops marched from Gumbo to the Garang Memorial in Juba on the 
morning of December 15, demanding payment for back wages.  Some 80 
soldiers then surrounded the Legislative Assembly building and fired 
several shots in the air.  One group of soldiers appeared ready to 
negotiate with the Government, according to Consulate General Juba, 
while another seemed less inclined.   No injuries have been 
reported. 
 
¶2. (U) Government of Southern Sudan President Salva Kiir, who was 
inside the Legislative Assembly at the time, addressed the 
protesters over the radio.  An SPLM spokesman also appealed to the 
public to remain calm, and military vehicles have been seen circling 
around town.  No shots have been fired since approximately 11:00 am 
local time. 
 
¶3. (U) The protesters are believed to be ex-South Sudan Defense 
Force (SSDF) troops who recently entered Joint Integrated Units with 
the SPLA.  According to reports, the soldiers have not been paid in 
four months. 
 
¶3. (SBU) All USG personnel in Juba have been accounted for, and are 
safe.  Embassy RSO has instructed one USAID officer and his driver 
currently at the UN compound to hold, until it is safe to return to 
the Consulate compound; all other USG personnel are already at the 
Consulate compound.  The UNDSS has given similar instructions to all 
UN staff.
