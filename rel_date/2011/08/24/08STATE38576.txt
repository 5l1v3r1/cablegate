SUBJECT: LETTER TO INCOMING AU COMMISSION CHAIRMAN JEAN 
PING ON APPOINTMENT OF A CHIEF MEDIATOR TO UN/AU JOINT 
MEDIATION SUPPORT TEAM 
 
 
 ¶1. (U) This is an action request. The USAU Permanent 
Representative is requested, jointly with other 
Contact Group Permanent Representatives, to sign the 
following letter to Incoming AU Commission Chairman Jean 
Ping. 
 
 
Begin Text 
---------- 
 
Chairman Ping, 
 
As supporters of the UN/AU-led Darfur peace process, we 
commend your efforts to resolve the Darfur conflict and 
deploy UNAMID, and to improve the humanitarian situation. We 
are highly appreciative of the efforts of UN Special Envoy 
Eliasson and AU Special Envoy Salim to advance the peace 
process. 
 
We remain concerned, however, that a Joint Chief Mediator 
has yet to be appointed. We therefore support the current 
Envoys in their view that having a single mediator working 
with the Government of Sudan, rebel movements, and other 
stakeholders, and providing day-to-day leadership of the 
Joint Mediation Support Team, will be crucial for the 
success of the peace process.  Such a mediator should be 
acceptable to all parties, dedicated full-time to the issue 
of resolving the Darfur conflict, and of a sufficiently 
high rank as to compel the attention of the parties and the 
international community. He or she should be willing to live 
and work full time in Sudan, and if not based in Darfur, 
should be willing to travel there regularly and for extended 
periods. 
 
At the recent Meeting of the International Partners in 
Geneva, there was consensus that the appointment of a 
Chief Mediator is an urgent and important next step in 
moving the Darfur peace process forward. We count on such 
a step to translate into significant progress for the 
UN/AU process at this particular juncture.  We believe 
this issue to be extremely urgent, and respectfully 
request your immediate attention. 
 
We reiterate our appreciation for the work of Special 
Envoys Eliasson and Salim, and your personal dedication to 
the 
resolution of the Darfur conflict. We also remain 
committed to peace in Darfur and in the rest of Sudan, and 
are ready to assist your efforts as the process moves 
forward. 
 
 
Sincerely
