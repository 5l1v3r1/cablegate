SUBJECT: MOROCCO SUPPORTS UNSCR 1874 ON NORTH KOREA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 66250 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary. Morocco supports the USG position on UNSCR 
1718 and 1874 and has agreed to take financial measures 
designed to limit the ability of the Democratic People,s 
Republic of Korea (North Korea) to fund weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile-related activities. 
Implementation of UNSCR 1874 "should not be a problem," said 
Abrahim Rahhaly, Chief of North America Division at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), highlighting Morocco,s 
laws against money laundering.  From a logistical 
perspective, he said, the MFA will take the lead on 
disseminating reftel information to appropriate ministries 
and financial institutions as the new Financial Intelligence 
Unit (FIU) is not yet prepared to manage these requests. End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche on July 1 to 
Abrahim Rahhaly, Head of the North American and Caribbean 
Division, and Mostafa Rezzouk, Director of North American 
Affairs, at the MFA and Hassan Aloui Abdellaoui, President of 
the FIU, at the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  Econoff provided 
copies of the Treasury Advisory in English and a non-official 
translation in French. Rahhaly said he would provide the 
Treasury Advisory to the relevant entities within the MFA, 
the MOF, the Central Bank (Bank Al Maghrib) and the FIU, 
which is still in a nascent stage. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The FIU's Abdellaoui appreciated the information, 
but emphasized that they are not ready to act as the central 
authority for this sort of information.  The MFA should 
continue to disseminate accordingly until the FIU is 
well-established, he stressed. The FIU is pursuing an 
interagency approach to receiving and implementing financial 
provisions, he said, recruiting staff from Bank Al Maghrib, 
MOF, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior and law 
enforcement agencies. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Morocco is committed to promoting international 
security, MFA's Rezzouk emphasized, noting the Government of 
Morocco's role as host of the first Conference for the Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT). This event, 
he continued, demonstrates Morocco's on-going commitment to 
oppose the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
materials and technology.
