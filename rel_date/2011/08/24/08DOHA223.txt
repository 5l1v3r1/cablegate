Thani (HBJ), and the head of OPIC had followed up with a 
letter of his own, delivered by the Embassy through MFA 
channels, to HBJ's office manager.  While Al-Rumaihi was

someone from Washington who could explain the project in 
detail and engage Qatari officials on providing financial 
support for it.
