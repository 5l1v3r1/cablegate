¶1.  (U)  USUN is authorized to draw from the points in para 2 
below during UNSC resolution 1701 consultations currently 
scheduled for December 11. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Begin points. 
 
--  We welcome the Secretary General's letter detailing 
progress made on UNSC resolution 1701 implementation. 
 
--  The Hizballah-initiated conflict in Lebanon resulted in 
enormous suffering by Lebanese and Israeli civilians and 
highlighted the risks of allowing the status quo in Lebanon 
to continue. 
 
--  We cannot forget that Hizballah triggered this 
destructive conflict with its unprovoked terrorist attack 
across the Blue Line that resulted in the deaths of several 
Israeli soldiers and the capture of two others.  The 
cessation of hostilities has held; Israeli troops have 
withdrawn as the Lebanese Armed Forces have historically 
deployed in southern Lebanon for the first time in almost 
forty years.  It is long past time for the Israeli soldiers, 
Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser, to be returned, 
unconditionally and immediately, to their families. 
 
--  We applaud the progress the Government of Lebanon has 
made in implementing UNSC resolution 1701.  The LAF has begun 
to take concrete steps to ensure the area between the Litani 
River and the Blue Line are free from personnel, assets, and 
weapons other than those of UNIFIL and the government. 
 
--  Implementation of UNSCR 1701 can only go so far in 
protecting innocent civilians in Lebanon.  We have seen a 
dangerous rise in Syrian- and Iranian-sponsored political 
unrest in Lebanon in recent weeks, including threats by 
Hizballah and its allies to overthrow the legitimate and 
democratically-elected government through street action.  We 
have also witnessed the assassination of Lebanese Minister of 
Industry, Pierre Gemayel.  These attempts to destabilize 
Lebanon are totally unacceptable, a violation of the spirit 
of UNSCRs 1559 and 1680, and a direct challenge to the 
international community.  We must be resolute in our 
response. 
 
--  Lebanese civilians will continue to live in uncertainty 
until the Government of Lebanon -- with the help of the 
international community -- is able to exercise its full 
sovereignty over all its territory and fully implements UNSC 
resolution 1559 and its follow-on resolutions, including the 
provisions regarding the disbanding and disarming of the 
militias. 
 
--  The people of Lebanon deserve to have lasting peace and 
security, but this will only happen when all nations respect 
Lebanon's territorial integrity, sovereignty, unity and 
political independence under the authority of its legitimate 
and democratically-elected government.  We call on all 
parties to support a free and democratic Lebanon. 
 
End points.
