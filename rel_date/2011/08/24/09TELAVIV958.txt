¶1. (SBU) Deputy Health Minister Ya'acov Litzman announced in a radio 
interview today that the two men diagnosed with swine influenza 
A/H1N1 in Israel are recovering and would likely be discharged to 
their homes later today or tomorrow.  As of 1600 local time, there 
are no further confirmed cases, although media reports indicate that 
at least two patients remain in isolation for observation by the 
Ministry of Health. 
 
¶2. (U) Israel has upgraded the flu pandemic alert to level 5 in 
parallel with WHO's action yesterday.  Following a meeting with the 
Deputy Ministers of Health and Defense, Prime Minister Netanyahu's 
office released a statement outlining the following steps Israel is 
taking to limit transmission of H1N1: 
 
-All those entering Israel will be asked to declare whether they 
have visited Mexico within the past week, and if so will be examined 
on the spot.  The Ministry of Health will request that these 
individuals remain at home and will continue to monitor them. 
Information pamphlets will be provided to all incoming travelers. 
 
-The Ministry of Health will increase stocks of medicines for the 
disease to a level that is among the five leading countries in the 
world for the medicines-to-population ratio. 
 
-The Foreign Ministry will defer official Israeli delegations to 
Mexico, and Israelis are called upon to avoid visiting Mexico at 
present.  Furthermore, the Foreign Ministry will contact the Mexican 
authorities and ask that they refrain from sending delegations and 
tourists to Israel at this time. 
 
¶3. (U) According to the statement, the Ministry of Health will 
continue to be responsible for monitoring H1N1 in Israel, and will 
begin an information campaign to instruct the public on how to 
reduce the chances of becoming infected with the disease and to 
prevent its spread.  The Prime Minister will chair a daily meeting 
to assess and monitor developments to prepare for additional 
measures as may become necessary, and relevant officials will be in 
continuous contact with the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and Jordan 
for cooperation on this issue.
