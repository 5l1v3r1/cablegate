REF: SECSTATE 80300 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 12, DepPolcouns delivered reftel demarche on 
the treatment of Amcits in Iran to MFA A6 Directorate for 
Arab and Middle East Countries First Counsellor Ioannis 
Pediotis.  Pediotis promised to look into the possibility of 
Greece's making an approach to the Iranians. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On June 18, Pediotis informed us that Greece would 
not make a bilateral approach to the Iranians but that the EU 
intended to approach Tehran on the issue.  Pediotis believed 
such a collective approach would be more effective than a 
bilateral approach by an individual EU-member state.
