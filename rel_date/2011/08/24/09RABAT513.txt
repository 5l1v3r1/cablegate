SUBJECT: MOROCCO SUPPORTS UAE HEADQUARTERS FOR IRENA 
 
REF: STATE 59969 
 
Morocco strongly supports the United Arab Emirates' bid to 
host the headquarters of the new International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA), and will lobby other countries to 
support that outcome, Rime Jirari, head of International 
Oganizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) told 
EconOff on June 12.  Commenting that that no Arab country 
currently hosts an international organization, Jirari 
welcomed USG support for the UAE bid.  Morocco had not yet 
taken any decision regarding the candidates for IRENA 
Director General or deputy Director General, she said, adding 
that the French DG candidate has been campaigning very 
actively for several months.  Jirari had no comments 
regarding the proposed mission of IRENA.
