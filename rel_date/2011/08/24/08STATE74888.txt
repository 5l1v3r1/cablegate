1.(SBU)  THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST CABLE.  Embassy Moscow 
please see paragraph 2. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BACKGROUND AND ACTION REQUEST.  Embassy Moscow is 
requested to pass to Col. Evgeniy Il'in, Main 
Directorate of International Military Cooperation, Ministry 
of Defense, the letter and delegation list at 
paragraph 4.  The letter proposes a meeting of site security 
technical experts for the purpose of responding 
to the Russian MOD Foreign Liaison Directorate's Note #3566 
of September 28, 2007.  This note requested 
information on U.S. requirements for site security for the 
building that will be selected to house the U.S.- Russia 
Joint Data Exchange Center (JDEC).  Washington proposes to 
hold the experts meeting on August 5 in Moscow. 
Additionally, Embassy Moscow is requested to deliver to Col. 
Il'in and appropriate Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Ministry of Defense officials the non-paper below in 
paragraph 5 proposing a meeting of legal experts on JDEC 
taxation issues on August 6 (or August 7) in Moscow.  The 
U.S. delegations for both meetings would 
total approximately 12 people and will include an 
interpreter. The highest level of U.S. representation for 
these meetings is not expected to be higher than the rank of 
Colonel (Naval Captain) or its civilian equivalent. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  When delivering the letter and non-paper, post 
should urge a Russian response to the proposed meeting dates 
as soon as possible, but not later than  July 31.  This will 
facilitate preparation and planning, including administrative 
arrangements for the trip.

Dear Colonel Il'in: 
 
Based upon the conversation you and I had on the margins 
of the 25 June 2008 JDEC meeting in Moscow, JDEC experts 
from the United States (see attached) are making plans to 
meet with you and other Russian JDEC experts on Tuesday, 5 
August 2008 to discuss the physical security requirements 
for the future JDEC site. 
 
Along with the rest of the U.S. JDEC delegation, I look 
forward to meeting with your JDEC team on 5 August. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Philip C. Jamison

¶5. (SBU)  BEGIN TEXT OF NON-PAPER: 
 
-- In view of the constructive meeting of U.S. and Russian 
legal experts on Joint Data Exchange Center (JDEC) 
liability issues on June 25, and since there is overlap 
between the JDEC site security delegation and the JDEC 
legal experts delegation,  the United States would like to 
propose a meeting on Wednesday, August 6 (or August 7 if the 
JDEC site security experts meet on August 6) on JDEC taxation 
issues. 
 
-- For your reference, the U.S. position on taxation is 
incorporated into the  U.S. proposal for a "Joint Statement 
Regarding the Issues of Liability and the Imposition of 
Taxes." (Provided to the Russian MFA on June 5, 2008.) 
 
-- U.S. legal experts not on the site security delegation 
would  arrive in Moscow a day later and be available to 
participate in a JDEC taxation meeting in Moscow on August 6 
(or August 7). 
 
-- This would be a good opportunity to make as much progress 
as possible in resolving outstanding JDEC legal 
issues. 
 
-- Alternatively, if Russian taxation experts are not 
available on August 6 or 7, the United States proposes a 
legal experts meeting to consider both liability and taxation 
issues on September 24 in Washington, D.C. 
 
-- The U.S. legal delegation would consist of the following 
individuals: 
John Arbogast (Department of State - Head of Delegation), 
Carl Tierney (Department of Defense), TBD (Department of 
Defense, Joint Staff), Steve Rosenkrantz (Department of 
State), Phil Jamison (Department of Defense), Daniel Roh 
(Department of Defense), Brad Martin (Department of Defense, 
U.S.Strategic Command), and USG Interpreter-TBD.
