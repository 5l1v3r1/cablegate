SUBJECT: IRANIAN DEPFORMIN ARAGHCHI DEFENDS NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
AT UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Speaking July 4 at the University of 
Pretoria, Iranian DepForMin Araghchi argued that Iran's 
nuclear program is peaceful, but stressed that Tehran will 
not give up its NPT right to enrich uranium.  Iran remains 
open to "creative" ideas on building confidence about the 
peaceful nature of its program, such as a joint venture on 
enrichment.  Iran was "a little disappointed" by South 
Africa's UNSC vote for sanctions on Iran.  Araghchi said Iran 
was willing to meet with the United States again on Iraq to 
"help the Iraqi government and people."  During his trip to 
South Africa, Araghchi reportedly met SAG DepForMin Aziz 
Pahad, likely to lobby for support in the UNSC.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Dr. Abbas Araghchi, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister 
for Legal and International Affairs, addressed a group of 
approximately 50 diplomats, academics, and journalists at the 
University of Pretoria on July 4.  The U.K.-educated Araghchi 
spoke in English for approximately one hour.  Hussein 
Solomon, Director of the Centre for International Political 
Studies (CiPS), told PolOff that the Iranians requested the 
public forum on short notice, and that Araghchi had met with 
South African DepForMin Aziz Pahad.  Araghchi's meeting with 
Pahad was not publicly announced by the South African 
Government.  Araghchi also attended part of the July 2-6 
meeting of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization, 
held in Cape Town.

Defense of Nuclear Program 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Araghchi devoted most of his remarks to "clarifying" 
the purpose of the Iranian nuclear program, repeating at 
length the standard Iranian talking points. 
 
-- The Iranian nuclear program has a long history, stretching 
back to the 1957 U.S.-Iranian agreement to develop nuclear 
energy.  Only after the revolution did the West begin to 
express concerns about Iran's intentions. 
 
-- Iran needs nuclear energy for its long-term development. 
Its oil and gas reserves will decline over time.  Iran wants 
to be "independent" in its nuclear energy program, so as to 
not rely on other countries.  This encompasses all stages of 
production, including enrichment. 
 
-- Iran remains committed to the NPT and IAEA safeguards 
agreements.  Because of its "inexperience," Iran failed at 
times to report certain issues to the IAEA, but these have 
all been "corrected."  The IAEA has confirmed that Iran has 
"corrected all failings."  The Agency has not been able to 
say there are no "undeclared" nuclear activities, but this 
will take time "since Iran is a big country;" it took 40 
years to certify Japan. 
 
-- Iran will never give up its right under the NPT to enrich 
uranium for peaceful purposes.  Tehran was willing to 
negotiate with the E-3 to "prove" its peaceful intent, but 
instead learned a "bitter lesson" from the Europeans who, 
when asking Iran to suspend its enrichment activities, 
instead meant cessation.  The E-3 package of proposals were 
full of "empty promises," some even "ridiculous" and 
"insulting," such as providing better Internet to Iran. 
 
-- The imposition of UNSC sanctions on Iran is "not 
surprising."  The Iranian people are "willing to pay the 
price" to establish their right to develop a peaceful nuclear 
program. 
 
-- Iran is willing to explore "creative" and "constructive" 
ideas to provide assurances about the peaceful nature of its 
nuclear program.  Araghchi suggested, for example, that Iran 
would be willing to consider a joint venture on its 
enrichment activities (NFI), as long as the activities take 
place on Iranian soil.  Tehran is open to suggestions on 
"building confidence" between the West and Iran.

Disappointed by South African UNSC Vote

¶4. (U) Araghchi said Tehran was "a little disappointed" by 
the South African support for the UNSC resolution imposing 
sanctions on Iran.  They appreciated Pretoria's efforts to 
amend the resolution and noted that many of South Africa's 
amendments had been accepted.  Araghchi added that overall 
relations between South Africa and Iran were "good," and they 
appreciated Pretoria's advice on "how to deal with the 
constant pressure." 
 
-------------------------------- 
Ahmadi-Nejad's Comments on Israel 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) Asked about President Ahmadi-Nejad's call for the end 
of the state of Israel, Araghchi argued that Iranian policy 
has been misunderstood.  Tehran supports a "one-state 
solution" for all the people of "Palestine."  They do not 
believe a two state solution will work.  If all the 
inhabitants of "Palestine" vote for a system of government 
that results in the end of the "Zionist regime," that is 
"their problem, not ours."  Iran has the right to present its 
formula for peace in the Middle East, like any other 
government.  He later added that the existence of the Israeli 
nuclear program exposes the "double standard" of the West and 
represents the real threat to the region. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Willing to Meet U.S. Again on Iraq 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) On Iraq, Araghchi said Iran was willing to hold 
another round of talks with the United States to "help the 
Iraqi people and government."  He said the United States is 
in a "desperate position" and urged Washington to announce an 
"exit plan."  Araghchi called for "strengthening" of the 
Iraqi political structures, including PM Maliki, since there 
is no alternative "for the moment."  The policy and army 
should also be supported and given more authority independent 
of the United States military.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) As Araghchi frankly admitted, the Iranians were no 
doubt disappointed by South Africa's UNSC vote in favor of 
sanctions.  Araghchi likely took advantage of his presence in 
South Africa for the Cape Town legal conference to lobby 
DepForMin Pahad on future UNSC action.  Araghchi's public 
presentation to press, diplomats, and academics -- unusual 
for high-level Iranian visitors -- suggests that Iran may be 
attempting to use public diplomacy to influence SAG policy on 
the Iranian nuclear question.
