(SBU)  We delivered reftel demarche to MFA IO Department 
Third Secretary Sergey Zhdanov on September 24, who said that 
the President's Special Representative for Sudan Mikhail 
Margelov had submitted a report to Medvedev emphasizing the 
importance of donating helicopters to Sudan.  Although the 
MFA had contacted the Presidential Administration multiple 
times supporting the same position, no substantive response 
had been received yet.  Zhdanov indicated that the Ministry 
of Defense had not yet obligated any helicopters.
