¶1. Summary. The GOI has raised its count of victims from the

continue to rise as more information becomes available.  An 
estimated 51,000 people have been displaced. The West Java 
Governor says the provincial and district government is able 
to handle the situation.  The GOI has not/not yet declared 
it as a national disaster.  The three-person Embassy team at 
the site reports no known American citizens injured or 
killed.  Seven foreign citizens were killed, nationals from 
Sweden, the Netherlands, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. 
The Consular section has no open welfare and whereabouts 
(w/w) inquiries for people reported traveling in Java.  The 
USG has made a USD 50,000 contribution to the International 
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in 
order to support the Indonesian Red Cross, which has 
dispatched relief supplies and deployed volunteers and 
medical teams.  The UN states that it is able to meet 
current disaster needs using existing resources and does not 
plan to issue a special appeal. End Summary.
