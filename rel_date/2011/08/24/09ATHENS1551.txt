Â¶1.  (SBU) Post delivered reftel to the Greek MFA's Southeastern 
Europe Directorate the morning of October 16.  Greece supports the 
membership of both Serbia and Montenegro in the Southeastern Europe 
Defense Ministerial and welcomed our message, calling it a most 
positive development.  The MFA will inform the Defense Ministry, as 
well.  On Kosovo, the MFA noted that Greece's stance is "well 
known," and that they are not ready to accept Kosovo membership in 
the SEDM.
