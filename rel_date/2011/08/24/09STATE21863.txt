SUBJECT: LETTER FROM SECRETARY CLINTON TO SYG BAN ON 
KUWAITI ARCHIVES 
 
¶1. This is an action request.  Please deliver the 
following message from Secretary Clinton to Secretary 
General Ban Ki-moon.  There will be no signed original. 
 
¶2. Begin text: 
 
Dear Mr. Secretary General: 
 
Thank you for your letter noting the status of efforts 
to locate the missing Kuwaiti archives and expressing 
concern over the lack of progress in this regard. 
 
The United States shares your concern regarding the 
location and repatriation of these documents and fully 
supports the work of Ambassador Tarasov in this effort, 
and more generally, Ambassador Tarasov's role as High- 
level Coordinator for missing Kuwaitis and third-country 
nationals and missing Kuwaiti property.  His work, and 
that of his predecessor Yuri Vorontsov, has, indeed, 
been commendable. 
 
Regrettably, the United States has no information at 
this time regarding the whereabouts of these documents. 
It is our hope that the greatly improved environment in 
Iraq, which the United Nations Assistance Mission for 
Iraq helped to bring about through its work on elections 
preparation and political reconciliation, will increase 
opportunities to investigate the whereabouts of these 
documents. 
 
The United States looks forward to the Ambassador's 
comprehensive report this April and assisting, if 
possible, in the documents' recovery. 
 
I offer assurances of our cooperation and my great 
personal regard. 
 
Sincerely yours, 
 
Hillary Rodham Clinton 
CLINTON
