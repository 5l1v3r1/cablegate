SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - MERCOSUR SUMMIT IN RIO 
 
Â¶1. On July 21, conservative, independent "La Tercera" (circ. 
101,000) carried an editorial entitled "Mercosur's Failed Promise." 
Quote: 
 
"For a long time Mercosur has seemed more a place for political 
gathering than a trade pact. But the bloc's ongoing Summit has made 
clear the extent (to which it has become political), and that could 
present challenges to Chile....  It is undeniable that Chile's 
staying in Mercosur is becoming more complicated as [Mercosur] shows 
signs of moving away from the political options for which Chile has 
opted in the last decades: trade openness and global integration, 
good relations with Washington, democracy and free trade economy."
