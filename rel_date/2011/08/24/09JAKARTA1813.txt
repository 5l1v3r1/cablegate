SUBJECT: BURMA -- BRIEFING INDONESIA ON NEW U.S. APPROACH 
 
REF: JAKARTA 1628 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  Mission continues to engage Indonesian 
government and civil society on the results of the USG's 
Burma policy review.  GOI officials praise the U.S. 
commitment to use a judicious mix of engagement, sanctions, 
and international and regional coordination to address the 
situation.  Civil society supports our continued objective of 
progress toward a peaceful, prosperous and reformed Burma. 
Indonesians--recognizing their role as the leading democracy 
in the region--want to work with the U.S. on ways to move the 
process forward.  Mission has handed out statements re Burma 
made by the Secretary and the EAP Assistant Secretary, 
including his recent testimony given on Capitol Hill.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
REVIEWING NEW APPROACH WITH GOI CONTACTS 
 
¶2.  (U) Mission continues to engage key Indonesian contacts 
regarding the United States' new approach toward Burma. 
Mission has briefed Indonesian officials at the Presidential 
Palace, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Vice 
President's Office and key members of Parliament on the new 
policy.  As reported in reftels, Mission contacts have 
praised the USG's policy review, seeing it as resulting in 
something more pragmatic and more likely to result in 
eventual change in Burma.  They have also underlined that 
Indonesia wants to work closely with the U.S. on ways to 
bring about change in Burma. 
 
MISSION EVENT FOR CIVIL SOCIETY 
 
¶3.  (U) Mission also hosted a large briefing and discussion 
on Burma on October 28.  The discussion was specifically 
meant for civil society activists, including those from the 
women's, labor and general human rights sectors.  Officials 
from the Vice President's Office, members of Parliament 
(DPR), and officials from the policy planning and human 
rights offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs also 
participated in the event. 
 
¶4.  (U) Mission officers underscored that the United States 
has begun a dialogue with the Burmese authorities intended to 
promote reform and end the country's international isolation. 
 We explained that the USG continues to seek a unified, 
peaceful, prosperous and democratic Burma.  We realized that 
neither sanctions nor engagement, implemented alone, have 
succeeded in transforming Burma.  We will continue to press 
the Burmese government to release all political 
prisoners--including Aung San Suu Kyi--and begin a genuine 
dialogue with the democratic opposition and ethnic minority 
groups.  We expect that engagement with the Burmese will be a 
long slow process. 
 
¶5.  (U) Mission officials underscored that Indonesia, as the 
leading democracy in ASEAN, had a special role to play on 
this matter.  Indonesia, for example, could leverage its Bali 
Democracy Forum initiative and engage Burma in the area of 
elections.  Mission also handed out statements re Burma made 
by the Secretary and the EAP Assistant Secretary, including 
his recent testimony given on Capitol Hill. 
 
¶6. (U) Indonesian contacts at the event were supportive 
toward the U.S. approach.  A key foreign policy advisor to 
Vice President Boediono--who had just returned from Myanmar 
on an official trip--agreed that Indonesia has a special role 
to play in promoting democracy in Burma.  The GOI looks 
forward to working with us as the new policy moves forward. 
A DPR member told us that Indonesia's transition from a 
military-dominated authoritarian government to a 
democracy--without widespread reprisals against the 
military--could serve as a model for Burma.  Indonesia's 
success in addressing ethnic separatist conflicts in regions 
like Aceh could also show Burma how to tackle similar 
regional problems, the contact related. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
¶7. (U) Mission plans to maintain its robust engagement with 
Indonesian contacts on Burma.  This will include further 
discussions with GOI officials, and outreach to civil society 
and student groups.
