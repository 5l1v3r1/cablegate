SUBJECT: KHARTOUM - DEMONSTRATIONS IN CITY/EAC MEETING 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 02156 
 
¶1.  Summary:  On September 6, a series of demonstrations was 
held in the adjoining cities of Omdurman and Khartoum.  The 
Embassy and its community were not significantly impacted. 
End summary. 
 
¶2.  Prior to September 6, there had been local media 
reporting as well as reporting from Embassy contacts that 
oppositions parties planned to stage demonstrations 
protesting a rise in prices of petroleum products and sugar. 
The Government of Sudan did not/not issue a permit for this 
demonstration. 
 
¶3. Beginning around 1000 (local time) hours the RSO began to 
receive reports of marches and demonstrations in the city of 
Omdurman, across the White Nile River from Khartoum.  After 
sorting through multiple sources of sometimes conflicting 
information, it seems fairly certain that there was a large 
rally or demonstration about the price rises in Omdurman, 
which was broken up by GoS forces using tear gas. 
 
¶4.  About 1400, new, but similar reports of demonstrations in 
the center of the city of Khartoum, near the University and 
about 7 to 10 blocks from the Chancery, began to be received 
by Embassy sources.  Due to a scheduled meeting of senior 
Western diplomats scheduled to take place in the Chancery, 
the Charge' convened a core EAC group meeting to discuss 
options. 
Once again, after sorting through the various reports 
received Post believes that a second anti-price rise 
demonstration or rally was again broken up by the use of tear 
gas.  Due to traffic conditions created by these events, the 
consensus of the core EAC was to recommend to the Charge that 
he postpone his meeting, which was done. 
 
¶5.  Post received one late report of limited burning of cars 
and stores, and some looting, but at this time that 
information remains a single source report and as such Post 
will not commit to its reporting as definite.
