¶1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified )- Please

¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The DCM visited the GOI's counternarcotics 
intelligence center, October 25.  The center is located in 
Jakarta and was created with USG funds to assist the 
Indonesian government track and roll up illegal drug 
operations and networks.  The center--with its focus on 
inter-agency coordination--has already developed valuable 
intelligence, which led to a substantial 
counter-methamphetamine operation, for example.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The DCM visited the Indonesian government's Joint 
Inter-agency Counter Drug Operations Center (JIACDOC) on 
October 25 to meet the Executive Director of the National 
Narcotics Board, three-star police General Pastika and staff. 
 He also toured the facility along with the RSO, poloff and 
DOD representatives.  The center has begun to prove its worth 
by developing intelligence on illegal drug factories and 
promoting enhanced inter-agency coordination. 
 
¶4. (SBU) JIACDOC is managed by the National Narcotics Board 
(BNN), part of the Indonesian National Police.  It began 
operations in 2005 thanks to funding from the U.S. Joint 
Inter Agency Task Force - West (JIATF - West), Pacific 
Command, Honolulu.  In August 2007, the center received 
official recognition from the GOI, and now also receives 
funding and personnel support directly from police sources. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Although the domestic center currently employs only 
four staff -- two USG-funded American contractors and two 
Indonesians, it is authorized to hire up to 107 additional 
personnel over the next few years.  The current USG financial 
support of approximately $500,000 per year pays for 
information technology and training support for the center. 
The GOI plans to provide $750,000 per year for personnel, 
equipment, and to support seven "out-stations" located 
throughout the country. 
 
¶6. (SBU) JIACDOC recently racked up a significant 
counternarcotics success when its intelligence-gathering 
operation assisted the INP in identifying a large crystal 
methamphetamine laboratory and support facilities on Batam, 
an island located approximately 20 miles south of Singapore. 
The INP raided three warehouses and one residence on October 
¶21.  The INP arrested two Taiwanese nationals and four 
Indonesians.
