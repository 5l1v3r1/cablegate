SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  TALKS WERE HELD OCTOBER 6-8 BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE 
B-H, CROATIAN, AND TURKISH GOVERNMENTS TO ESTABLISH THE 
FRAMEWORK FOR A TRILATERAL ENTITY THAT WOULD MONITOR THE 
RIGHTS OF REFUGEES (ABDIC SUPPORTERS) WHO RETURN FROM 
CROATIA TO THE VELIKA KLADUSA AREA.  TURKISH DELEGATION 
HAS RETURNED TO ANKARA TO SEEK APPROVAL FOR PARTICIPATION 
IN SUCH AN EFFORT.  SEVERAL DETAILS REMAIN UNSETTLED, BUT 
ALL THREE GOVERNMENTS ARE WORKING QUICKLY TO GET THE ISSUE 
RESOLVED SO THE REFUGEES CAN RETURN HOME BEFORE WINTER 
SETS IN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
TRYING TO BUILD TRUST 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE THE 22,000 REFUGEES FROM 
VELIKA KLADUSA TO RETURN HOME VOLUNTARILY, THE CROATIAN 
GOVERNMENT HAS DEVELOPED FURTHER ITS EARLIER IDEA TO 
ESTABLISH A MONITORING FORCE COMPRISED OF POLICE FROM 
TURKEY, CROATIA, AND BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA (FROM AN AREA 
OUTSIDE OF BIHAC).  REPRESENTATIVES OF THE THREE 
GOVERNMENTS MET IN CROATIA AND IN VELIKA KLADUSA OCTOBER 
6-8 TO WORK OUT THE MODALITIES OF SUCH A MONITORING FORCE.

¶3. ACCORDING TO THE PLAN, THE B-H GOVERNMENT WOULD AGREE 
TO REMOVE THE V CORPS FROM THE AREA, PROVIDE WRITTEN 
GUARANTEES OF THE RIGHTS THAT WILL BE GRANTED TO 
RETURNEES, PARTICIPATE IN THE TRILATERAL MONITORING 
EFFORT.  IT IS THE HOPE OF ALL PARTIES THAT WITH SUCH 
PROVISIONS IN PLACE THE REFUGEES WILL VOLUNTARILY RETURN 
TO THEIR HOMES. 
 
--------------------------------- 
RESULTS OF TRILATERAL DISCUSSIONS 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  ACCORDING TO THE TURKISH EMBASSY IN ZAGREB, THE TALKS 
WERE BASICALLY POSITIVE, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NUMEROUS 
DETAILS STILL TO BE DECIDED.  THE GROUPS DISCUSSED THE 
MANDATE, DURATION, AND SIZE OF THE FORCE, AND IT WAS 
DECIDED THAT 
 
-- THE PARTICIPANTS WILL ONLY MONITOR; THEY ARE NOT IN A 
POSITION TO ENFORCE.  VIOLATIONS WOULD BE REPORTED TO THE 
B-H GOVERNMENT; ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTION WOULD BE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES. 
 
-- THE RATIO WILL BE 50 PERCENT BOSNIAN, 25 PERCENT 
CROATIAN, AND 25 PERCENT TURKISH. 
-- THE TERRITORY TO BE COVERED IS APPROXIMATELY 400 SQUARE 
KILOMETERS, INCLUDING VELIKA KLADUSA AND SEVERAL VILLAGES 
NEAR CAZIN.

ISSUES STILL PENDING 
-------------------- 
 
¶5.  THE SIZE OF THE FORCE HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED, BUT 
POSSIBILITIES RANGED FROM 100 TO 200 POLICE OFFICERS.  (WE 
HAD HEARD ORIGINALLY THAT THE FORCE WOULD CONSIST OF ABOUT 
150 INDIVIDUALS.) 
 
¶6.  THE LARGEST UNRESOLVED ISSUE, HOWEVER, IS THE MATTER 
OF WRITTEN, ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS FROM THE B-H GOVERNMENT. 
THE REFUGEES ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE AMNESTY THAT HAS 
BEEN ANNOUNCED BY SARAJEVO.  THEY WANT SPECIFIC GUARANTEES 
IN WRITING THAT COVER SUCH TOPICS AS NO PROSECUTION FOR 
WAR CRIMES, NO CONSCRIPTION INTO THE MILITARY, RETURN OF 
ALL PROPERTY THAT HAS BEEN SEIZED BY OTHERS (REFUGEES FROM 
BANJA LUKA WHO WERE BUSED INTO THE BIHAC AREA BY THE 
CROATIAN GOVERNMENT), EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, ETC.

¶7.  THE TWO-PERSON TURKISH DELEGATION (MURAT ADALI, FIRST 
SECRETARY AT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN CHARGE OF 
 
SIPDIS 
BALKAN AFFAIRS, AND KAMIL TECIROGLU, DEPUTY SECRETARY 
GENERAL OF SECURITY AT THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR) HAVE 
RETURNED TO ANKARA TO SEEK APPROVAL FOR TURKEY TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE MONITORING EFFORT.  BEFORE  LEAVING 
CROATIA, THEY ASSURED THE OTHER TWO PARTIES THAT THEY WILL 
SPEED THE PROCESS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, IN ORDER TO GET THE 
MONITORS IN PLACE AND ENCOURAGE THE REFUGEES TO RETURN 
BEFORE WINTER SETS IN. 
 
¶8.  THE CROATIAN GOVERNMENT IS ESPECIALLY NERVOUS ABOUT 
THE POSSIBILITY OF A HUMANITARIAN DISASTER ON ITS HANDS IF 
THE UNTENABLE SANITARY CONDITIONS RESULT IN AN EPIDEMIC OR 
WINTER WEATHER CAUSES SOME OF THE REFUGEES TO FREEZE TO 
DEATH.
