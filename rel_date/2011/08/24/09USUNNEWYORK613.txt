SUBJECT: SUDAN: COUNCIL CONSIDERS SANCTIONS COMMITTEE REPORT 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY: On June 19, Austrian Perm Rep Mayr-Harting, 
chair of the Sudan Sanctions Committee ("1591 Committee") 
updated the UN Security Council on the Committee's activities 
over the previous ninety days highlighting the Committee's 
informal consultations to review the Panel of Experts'(POE) 
midterm report and the exchange of views with Joint UN-AU 
Special Representative.  Ambassador DiCarlo noted concern 
over the lack of cooperation with the POE by both the 
Government of Sudan (GOS) and other UN bodies and reports 
that the GOS violated the arms embargo in Darfur.  UK, 
France, and Burkina Faso also echoed disappointment with the 
difficulties faced by the POE and the lack of cooperation by 
the GOS, while noting the critical importance of the POE's 
work.  Libya focused on the Committee's responsibility not to 
exacerbate strained relations between the POE and the GOS 
while referencing a paragraph in the POE's report to 
illustrate that the International Criminal Court (ICC) 
indictment is undermining the political process 
in Sudan.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. On June 19, Austria Perm Rep Mayr-Harting, chair of the 
Sudan Sanctions Committee ("1591 Committee") briefed the UN 
Security Council on the Committee's activities over the 
previous ninety days.  He noted that Joint UN-AU Special 
Representative Adada had met with the Committee and explained 
that: 1) the earlier UN denial of country clearance to the 
POE was due to security concerns in the backdrop of the ICC 
indictment (NOTE:  Security clearance was eventually granted. 
 END NOTE); 2) the United Nations-African Union Mission in 
Darfur (UNAMID) was not fully deployed and therefore made it 
difficult to support the operational work of the POE; and 3) 
the current capacity of UNAMID also made it difficult to 
dedicate further resources to monitoring the arms embargo. 
However, UNAMID was ready to provide the Committee with 
information related to the arms embargo in Darfur. 
 
¶3.  Mayr-Harting highlighted to the Council the difficulties 
that the POE faced in its relations with the GOS including 
the visa denial of the arms expert, the subsequent 
resignation of the arms expert, and the lack of GOS response 
to numerous queries made by the POE. Mayr-Harting also 
reported on the POE's assertion that relevant UN bodies, 
including the peacekeeping operations, were not sharing 
information related to the POE's mandate.  Finally, 
Mayr-Harting noted that he continued to discuss a possible 
exchange of views between the Committee and Sudan's Perm Rep 
Mohamad. 
 
¶4. Ambassador DiCarlo said that the United States believes 
that targeted sanctions play an important role in supporting 
peace and stability in the region by both encouraging 
reconciliation amongst those committed to peace and isolating 
those who oppose it.  She emphasized that the arms embargo 
helps to reduce flow of arms to Darfur and expressed strong 
concern over the POE report that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles 
(UAV's) were delivered to the GOS and used for military 
purposes in Darfur.  Moreover, DiCarlo expressed 
disappointment that the GOS was hampering the work of the POE 
by not issuing visas and not answering POE requests.  DiCarlo 
commended the Secretariat's efforts to improve cooperation 
with the POE, including facilitation of travel, however 
called on the Secretariat to continue to look for ways to 
facilitate the POE's movement and access in the region. 
 
 
¶5.  Libyan Deputy Perm Rep D'Abbashi expressed concern over 
the deteriorating political and security situation in Darfur, 
noting that a comprehensive political settlement was urgently 
needed.  To this end, he asserted, certain outside actions 
such as the ICC indictment strengthened the position of other 
armed groups and hindered the political process.  D'Abbashi 
pointed to a section of the POE's report that stated that the 
indictment seemed to have emboldened some movements (NOTE: 
The POE report also stated that the indictment may have urged 
the GOS to increase investment in the peace process.  END 
NOTE.)  Finally, he urged the Committee to play a positive 
role in repairing the relationship between the POE and the 
GOS.  He also urged the GOS to stop denying visas to the POE. 
 Finally, D'Abbashi supported Committee dialogue with UNAMID 
but stated that this could undermine UNAMID's credibility 
vis--vis the GOS if direct channels between UNAMID and the 
Committee were created. 
 
¶6.  French Political Coordinator De Riviere called for an 
immediate cease fire and expressed concern that the work of 
 
USUN NEW Y 00000613  002 OF 002 
 
 
the POE was being hampered.  He characterized the level of 
GOS cooperation as insufficient. 
 
¶7.  UK Political Coordinator Quarry called the POE an 
invaluable source of information to the Council and 
reiterated concern that the POE was unable to fulfill its 
mandate in light of the difficulties it faces.  He called 
attention to the GOS denial of the arms expert's visa which 
he referred to as a clear attempt to stop the Committee's 
work.  Quarry called on all states to implement 1591 
obligations and supported a widening of the arms embargo to 
include all of Sudan. 
 
¶8.  Burkina Faso Perm Rep Kafando expressed concern over the 
difficulties of the POE with the GOS and within the UN.  He 
stated that all parties must cooperate with the POE and was 
encouraged by the Committee Chair's continued contact with 
the GOS.
