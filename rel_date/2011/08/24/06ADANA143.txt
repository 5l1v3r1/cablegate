¶1. (SBU) Information for CA Only:  Mr. Ozel spent considerable 
time during the welfare and where abouts visit talking about his 
family situation.  He volunteered that he receives disability 
checks form the U.S. and that previously his wife helped to 
support the family with various jobs, which included teaching 
and cashiering.  He showed a hand written note, which he says 
his wife gave him the night before her departure.  The note 
explains that Ms. Ozel wanted to go to the U.S. to see her 
father, who is ill, says she has bought a ticket, asks her 
husband to take her to the airport in the morning, and says she 
loves him and not to be angry.  Mr. Ozel indicated that Ms. Ozel 
did not asked or try to take the children to the U.S. with her. 
He explained how the family came to Turkey together and how he 
and his wife were working on finding a teaching position for Ms. 
Ozel.  He says he would welcome his wife back and seems puzzled 
by her departure.  He does not see himself as having abducted 
the children as the family came to Turkey together to make a new 
home.

¶1.  (U) Consular Officer Telside Manson and Consular Assistant 
Maide Turkesar met with AmCit Mete Ozel and two of his AmCit 
children, Cengiz and Melissa Ozel, at the Consulate on Tuesday, 
June 6, 2006.  Mr. Ozel confirmed the contact information listed 
in reftel is current.  He also provided his cell phone number, 
which is:  0546-935-0500. 
 
¶2.  (U) Abuse:  Neither child had any visible bruises or other 
signs of physical abuse.  The children were shy at first, but 
over the course of a 45 minute meeting and cookies, they became 
quite talkative.  Both children got up from their chairs on 
several occasions, playing in the meeting area, and twice Cengiz 
came over to his father's chair and squeezed into the seat with 
him.  The children were relaxed and comfortable in their 
father's presence.  Both children smiled frequently and 
laughed/giggled on a few occasions.  When asked if he had spoken 
with his mother, Cengiz said he had talked to her over the 
phone. 
 
¶3. (U) Clothing:  Both children were dressed in appropriate 
summer clothing.  The clothes were not brand new nor were they 
very worn.  The clothes were all clean. 
 
¶4. (U) Nutrition:  Both children looked healthy and well fed. 
Mr. Ozel said that neither child has had any problems with the 
food since the first incident, which he attributed to a normal 
adjustment to Turkish cuisine.  Mr. Ozel says his mother does 
most of the cooking in the house.  Cengiz volunteered that he 
likes Turkish food. 
 
¶5. (U) Living Environment:  Mr. Ozel said the family is planning 
to stay at the current residence until later in the summer when 
he hopes to move the family to Antalya.  He is not currently 
working and says he is the primary caregiver for the children. 
He said he often takes them to a nearby park which the children 
enjoy.  When asked if he missed school and his friends in the 
U.S., Cengiz just smiled.  Mr. Ozel said Cengiz would start 
school in the fall.  Under the Turkish system, Cengiz was too 
young to attend public school this year.  Both children spoke in 
English, however, Cengiz did know a few Turkish words.
