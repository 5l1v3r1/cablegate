SUBJECT:  Ukrainian Firm to Sell Sudan Turbo Jets 
 
¶1.  On February 7, the Sudan Tribune web site posted an 
article dated February 6 from "Kharkiv" which indicates 
that the Kharkiv aviation plan in Ukraine has signed a 
contract in late 2005 to supply five AN-74 light turbo 
jet aircraft to Sudan.  The multifunctional AN-74 is 
described as "intended for transportation of freights and 
people on airlines of average extent in any climatic 
conditions and on any attitudes, including conditions of 
Arctic and in high mountain regions."  The contract is 
allegedly valued at 85 million, and will come into force 
in March 2006.  The client was not indicated. 
 
¶2.  On February 7, a transcript of a news item from the 
"Kiev Unian," a major independent news agency, indicated 
that the Director General of Kharkiv, Pavlo Naumenko, had 
provided the same information in a press briefing. 
 
¶3.  Embassy Khartoum would be interested in obtaining 
further information Embassy Kiev might have regarding 
this aircraft sale.
