Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) ESTH Counselor met with the representatives of the Security 
and Disarmament Division of the MFA on November 12 and delivered the 
non-paper and talking points conveyed reftel B.  Our interlocutors 
were pleased by the interest of the USG in advancing the space 
security dialogue, requested more information on the US delegation, 
said that the GOR was working on a POC for future communications on 
space conjunctions and near approaches, and promised to pass the 
request to set up familiarization visits before the proposed January 
meeting to the relevant authorities.  End Summary. 
 
GOR Treating Space Security Dialogue Very Seriously 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Vladimir Yermakov, Head of the Office of 
Military-Strategic Issues and formerly in the Russian Embassy in 
Washington, joined Alexander Klapovskiy, Expert on military space 
and ABM systems, and Andrey Grebenshchikov, third secretary, for the 
first few minutes of the meeting, noting that their office has been 
working on START, MD, and space security issues.  After Yermakov 
left, Klapovskiy noted the Russian side wants to establish fruitful 
cooperation and believes the first planning meeting needs to set as 
its goal determining the nature of our cooperation.  If we are to 
engage in regular exchanges, we should determine how often to meet, 
where, and how to set the agenda.  Although our recent cooperation 
was caused by the February collision, the congested nature of space 
and the importance of these issues meant that we needed to continue. 
 Recognizing that the U.S. decision not to accept the Russian 
proposal to meet November 14 stems from our desire to prepare well 
for the exchange, Klapovskiy noted serious U.S. proposals in the 
previous non-paper -- the possibility of joint monitoring and the 
possibility of joint research by experts of long-term conditions. 
Both of these proposals merit serious study.  The Russian side 
therefore put into its paper TCBMs that expand on those proposed in 
2007 by including not just the U.S. and Russia, but other space 
states. 
 
POC for Notifications 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU):  The MOD has prepared a recommendation on a point of 
contact for notifications that is awaiting signature.  The MFA will 
inform us as soon as it arrives -- hopefully the week of November 
16th. After the POCs were established, perhaps the U.S. and Russia 
could establish a "Center for Predicting the Situation in Space" in 
which we could jointly work on expected collisions, conjunctions, 
close approaches, satellites that are no longer in control or in 
declining orbit.  Klapovskiy twice thanked ESTHCouns for the 
information the U.S. side has been passing on space near approaches. 
 He stressed that it is being used, even though the Russian side has 
not given us any questions. 
 
Jan 20-21 Experts Meeting in Paris 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) EST Counselor shared the U.S. non-paper and agenda, noting 
that the U.S. proposal is to hold a substantive discussion at the 
first meeting, not merely to agree upon the character of our future 
work and how we would structure it.  She noted that if the Russian 
side would like to discuss the nature and modalities of our 
cooperation, we could perhaps do so before the Jan 20-21 meeting. 
Klapovskiy said he understood that the U.S. had changed the nature 
of the meeting, which we had characterized before as a planning 
meeting.  He seemed pleased that we want to do more. 
 
Familiarization Visits of Military Space Experts 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5. (SBU): Klapovskiy promised to pass the suggestion to the relevant 
authorities and let us know.
