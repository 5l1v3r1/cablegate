CONFERENCE 
 
 
¶1. Israel hosted a conference on "Deserts and Desertification 
-- Challenges and Opportunities" under the aegis of the 
United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). 
The conference took place November 6-9 at the Jacob Blaustein 
Institutes for Desert Research of the Ben Gurion University 
of the Negev. There were about 250 participants from over 30 
countries.  Conference speakers emphasized the importance of 
combating desertification and not deserts, best practices 
towards that end, and the opportunities that arid and 
semi-arid environments present for supporting human life and 
preserving the natural environment. 
 
¶2.  Ambassador Gregroire de Kalbermatten, Deputy Secretary 
General of the UNCCD, noted that Israel has a lot to share 
with the world related to survival in desert and semi-arid 
conditions.  That comment was borne out by field trips that 
showed off Israeli research and achievements in drylands 
agriculture and habitat adaptation.  Participants from Africa 
were eloquent in both formal presentations and informal 
conversations in highlighting how traditional lifestyles and 
practices provided opportunities for preserving grazing and 
other land uses.  The challenges of over population of both 
humans and livestock in fragile environments were addressed 
by several speakers. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  The Challenges and Opportunities Conference 
gave Israel a chance to show off its achievements in 
reclaiming desert lands, but also afforded opportunity for 
significant and substantial exchange among a wide range of 
experts and practitioners.  Despite political differences, 
Israeli research does reach counterparts in Arab countries 
through scientific journals and other contact.  More 
information on the conference can be found at 
desertopportunities.org/site/.  End comment.
