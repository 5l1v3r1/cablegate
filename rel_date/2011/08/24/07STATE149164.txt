SUBJECT: MINURSO CONSULTATIONS 
 
¶1. (U) USUN is instructed to draw from the following talking 
points during the 26 October 2007 UN Security Council 
consultations on MINURSO. 
 
Begin Talking Points: 
 
-- We are pleased that Morocco and the Polisario have met for 
two rounds of negotiations under the auspices of the United 
Nations.  We welcome this development and urge both parties 
to commit to full discussion of the substantive issues during 
the next round of talks. 
 
-- We believe that meaningful autonomy is a promising and 
realistic way forward.  Morocco,s proposal is a serious and 
credible initiative that provides the realistic basis for 
negotiations. 
 
-- We support a renewal of the MINURSO mandate at this time; 
however, the USG wants to see progress towards a political 
solution of this conflict before the next renewal. 
 
-- We hope to hear soon that the parties have agreed to a 
date and venue for the third round of talks. 
 
-- The United States remains convinced that the Western 
Sahara conflict continues to impede regional integration and 
development in the Maghreb.  Unresolved, this humanitarian 
crisis leaves the Sahrawi people with a bleak future. 
 
End Talking Points:
