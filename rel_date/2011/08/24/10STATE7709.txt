SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: BONA FIDES INQUIRY 
INVOLVING  PARTIES TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT (TAA) 
0235-08F 
 
REF: BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 2006 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. Reason for request: The Department's Office of Defense 
Trade Controls Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's 
assistance in conducting a bona fides check on The Olive 
Group, Al Mahoo for Telecom Services, and Al Wadi Al Kabeer 
Company Ltd.   Before approval of the proposed amendment to 
Technical Assistance Agreement TAA-0235-08F, which adds the 
sublicensees as parties, Post is requested to establish these 
companies' bona fides.  Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern inquiry within 30 days. Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and future 
applications involving parties to this Agreement. 
 
¶3. Action:  The Department requests that Post make inquiries 
with the Government of Iraq, Ministry of Defense (MOD) to 
confirm the bona fides of The Olive Group, Al Mahoo for 
Telecom Services, and Al Wadi Al Kabeer company Ltd. on the 
proposed amendment.  The following questions are provided as 
guidance: 
 
--Does the company have proper supporting documentation, 
including a contract with the Iraq MOD for 
inclusion on the proposed amendment? 
 
--Will the company be handling or storing United States 
Munitions List (USML) items listed in the agreement? 
If so, does it have secure facilities and proper accounting 
and security procedures for handling these 
sensitive USML items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? How many and what types of employees 
(program managers, service technicians, etc.) does the 
company have?  What process was used to vet them 
for these sensitive roles? 
 
--Does the company appear in Iraqi business directories? 
Does the company have a website? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what types of items 
does it handle, and does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What types of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against 
unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
Finally, Post is asked to assess whether each company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items. 
 
End action. 
 
¶4. Background and Relevant Details Concerning TAA-0235-08F: 
 
The original agreement (TAA-0235-08) approved under 
"Operation Iraqi Freedom" on 6 February 2008, covers the 
permanent export of unclassified, Significant Military 
Equipment (SME) technical data, hardware, and defense 
services related to the AN/VRC-series SINCGARS Radio and 
associated equipment for the Iraq MOD. It was intended to 
permit the U.S. Applicant to collaborate with other parties 
to this agreement to provide the Iraq MOD with operation, 
installation, transportation, optimization, use, maintenance 
support and training related to the defense articles 
associated with the agreement. 
 
Pursuant to Section 36(c) of the Arms Export Control Act 
(AECA) and Section 123.15(a)(1) of the International Traffic 
in Arms Regulations (ITAR), certification was provided to the 
Congress prior to granting approval of the transaction since 
the export of SME sold under contract exceeded USD 
$50,000,000 to, Iraq, a country that is not a member country 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Australia, 
Japan or New Zealand.  Now, following Congressional approval 
of the original Agreement and five subsequent amendments, 
Amendment F, seeks to expand the scope of the Agreement and 
increase its value.  The amendment requests to add the Olive 
Group, an entity that is registered with PM/DTCC, as well as 
the two unfamiliar Iraqi parties, named above.
