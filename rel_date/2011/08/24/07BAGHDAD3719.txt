Begin Text: 
 
Dear Mr. Secretary General: 
 
   On behalf of the Government and people of Iraq, I wish to 
express my deep gratitude to the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization for its enormous and crucial assistance to our 
efforts to establish a secure, prosperous, and democratic 
Iraq.  We especially wish to thank NATO for the work of the 
NATO Training Mission - Iraq whose efforts have contributed 
significantly to the growing self-reliance of our security 
forces. 
 
   As our security improves, the burden of maintaining order 
and assisting the general public falls increasingly on our 
police.  In this connection, we are thankful for the 
Italian-led carabinieri-type training for our National Police 
recently begun. 
 
   Although in recent months, with the assistance of the 
Coalition and NATO, we have made significant visible strides 
in improving security, much remains to be done. The NATO 
Training Mission - Iraq's contribution is now even more 
important than ever as we complete the organization, 
equipping, and training of our forces and support 
organizations to achieve self-reliance. We hope that NATO 
will continue to provide this support for the remainder of 
2007 and for 2008.  We continue to work closely with the 
commander, Lieutenant General James Dubik, to make the best 
use of NATO capabilities to assist us to meet our most 
important training requirements. 
 
Sincerely, 
Dr. Mowaffak al Rubaie 
National Security Advisor 
Republic of Iraq
