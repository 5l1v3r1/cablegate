SUBJECT: EXBS ADVISOR APRIL 26 TO MAY 10, 2009 MONTH END REPORT, 
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶I. BROAD ITEMS OF INTEREST TO ADVISORS AND AGENCY MANAGERS: EXBS 
activities during this reporting period included: 
 
¶1. (U) EXBS Advisor Fetty arrived at Kabul, Afghanistan on April 26, 
¶2009. Advisor Fetty was Advisor in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, 
Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan prior to his assignment to Afghanistan. 
EXBS Program Coordinator Roohullah Shekaib attended the UGA Export 
Control and Policy Workshop held at the University of Georgia from 
4/11/09 to 4/24/09 and participated in meetings in WADC from 4/25/09 
to 4/28/09. 
 
II. COMPLETED ACTIONS FOR REPORTING PERIOD (KABUL, AFGHANISTAN): 
 
¶A. Site Assessments and Meetings held during this Reporting Period. 
 
¶1. (U) The Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program 
has been working with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) 
to establish a modern Import/Export licensing system.  EXBS agreed 
to provide the funding for the installation of equipment and 
training by Bearing Point Management and Technology Consultants. The 
Export Control licensing project was supported by MoCI Minister Dr. 
Farhang.  The Minister subsequently provided a written commitment to 
collaborate with the U.S. Embassy to draft a new Export Control Law 
(Strategic Control Act).  The previous EXBS Advisor Michael Seguin 
worked closely with the MoCI and Bearing Point to obligate funding 
for an assessment and hardware and software development and 
delivery. (See EXBS Advisor report for October 2008).  The equipment 
was delivered to the Embassy in April, 2009 but Bearing Point was 
unable to install it due to an unexpected demand by the Deputy 
Minister to provide support for construction or renovation of a room 
to house the equipment. This request had not been part of any 
previous discussions and ISN/ECC determined that it was an 
unreasonable request. At a May 5 follow-up meeting with the new 
Minister of Commerce and Industry Mr. Shahran, the Embassy was 
informed that the MoCI is now ready to proceed to the next phase of 
this project. 
 
¶2. (U) The Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) provided the 
Embassy with an official notice stating that they welcome the 
assistance of the Embassy and EXBS in developing a new Export 
Control Law (Strategic Goods Act).   This law, based on European 
Union (EU) models of similar laws, will incorporate control lists 
and provide the legal foundation to institutionalize controls on the 
movement of weapons of mass destruction and their precursors.  EXBS 
provided funds to translate a version of a model EU law into Dari. 
The model EU law will serve as a starting point for the MoCI to 
draft their Strategic Goods bill. Other key stake holders such as 
the Ministry of Finance (Customs) and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs have expressed their commitments to getting this draft 
legislation completed. 
This project will build capacity for the Afghan government in the 
area of non-proliferation controls and will provide a legal 
foundation for the use of international Control Lists and Import, 
Export and Transshipment controls for the movement of Weapons of 
Mass Destruction. The new hardware and software will automate their 
current license control system.  This effort will include a database 
that can efficiently manage licensing approvals as well as give the 
law enforcement community better visibility of the movement of all 
shipments in and out of Afghanistan. Until recently, due to security 
concerns in the Kabul area, EXBS was unable to provide follow-up 
legislative development assistance.  The EXBS Advisor was recently 
able to inform ISN/ECC that this training can now be scheduled. 
 
¶3. (U) The EXBS Advisor and Border Management Task Force (BMTF) 
 
KABUL 00001255  002 OF 003 
 
 
officials Edmund Cassidy and Jim Petree met with Afghan Customs 
Director General Mr. Bismellah Kammawie and Mr. Amir Mohammad, 
Director of Kabul International Airport Customs to discuss future 
cooperation, equipment and training that can be provided by EXBS and 
BMTF.  Mr. Kammawie stated that he is very grateful for the 
equipment and assistance that the United States has provided to 
date. He requested that EXBS exchange the large 13.5 ton forklifts 
that were provided in 2007 for smaller 3.0 ton units that could be 
used to offload palletized cargo at the Inland Cargo Depots (ICD). 
The Advisor and BMTF officials visited the ICD in Kabul.  The 13.5 
ton forklift was not being used and the crowded conditions in the 
ICD truck lot allowed very little room for the unit to maneuver. The 
Director also requested additional training on the new x-rays that 
EXBS provided.  The Director is very interested in getting 
enforcement training institutionalized in the Customs curriculum. 
The Advisor informed the Director about the training program for 
host government academy instructors that is held at FLETC with 
visits to the host country by FLETC instructors. Mr. Cassidy also 
informed him about the BMTF train-the-trainer training provided by 
the BMFT Mentors. Both programs would complement each other. The 
Director was very interested in these two programs and requested 
that EXBS and BMTF contact our agencies to see if we can get these 
programs established in Afghanistan. 
 
¶B. Training Conducted During Report Period. 
 
¶1. None 
 
¶C. Training Programs Pending. 
 
¶1. (U) EXBS has requested ISN/ECC contract with Commonwealth Trading 
Partners (CTP) to conduct legislative development assistance in 
Afghanistan. The assistance is necessary to help the Afghan 
officials identify deficiencies in existing export control laws and 
regulations, and to help them draft laws and regulations that meet 
accepted international standards. CTP has already provided workshops 
on National Control Lists, Legal and Regulatory procedures in 
Afghanistan, and Licensing Process and Procedures. 
 
¶2. (U) On May 3, 2009 EXBS delivered a diplomatic Note to the 
Government of Afghanistan inviting them to send three participants 
to the United Nations Resolution 1540 Workshop.  The Workshop will 
be held June 23 - 25 in Colombo, Sri Lanka and hosted by the 
Governments of Sri Lanka and the United States.  Resolution 1540 
decides that all States shall take and enforce effective measures to 
establish domestic controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, 
chemical or biological weapons and their delivery systems. The 1540 
Workshops promote capacity-building on national and regional levels 
to advance full implementation of Resolution 1540. EXBS Afghanistan 
has requested that ISN/ECC provide funding for a Resolution 1540 
Workshop in Kabul, Afghanistan.  This workshop would provide the 
information to produce documentation that would result in satisfying 
Afghanistan's UNSCR 1540 submissions.  The previous EXBS Advisor has 
made inquires to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this proposed 
event and all the associated Ministries having a stake in UNSCR 1540 
are supportive of this workshop.  EXBS headquarters has indicated a 
willingness to fund and sponsor the 1540 workshop.  The EXBS 
workshops consist of a cross section of more than 13 Ministries. 
Opportunities for ministries to interact and network on issues of 
non-proliferation are rare.  EXBS is providing an important vehicle 
to bring Ministries routinely together.  EXBS hopes that the 
knowledge gained by the three participants to the Resolution 1540 
Workshop in Sri Lanka will greatly enhance their ability to 
implement 1540 in Afghanistan.

¶2. (U) On May 3, 2009 EXBS delivered a Diplomatic Note to the 
Government of Afghanistan inviting them to send three participants 
to the tenth International Export Control Conference in Istanbul, 
Turkey on June 25 - 27, 2009. The Governments of Turkey and the 
United States will co-host the event. Officials from more then sixty 
countries have been invited to attend the conference. 
 
¶3. (U) EXBS has entered into an agreement with BMTF to use BMFT 
Mentors located near border crossing posts and ICDs as trainers on 
selected EXBS equipment. The trainers will all have experience as 
border inspectors and knowledgeable on the equipment. This agreement 
was reached because of the difficulty EXBS has in traveling to 
certain areas within Afghanistan due to the increased security 
concerns. The EXBS staff will still provide training whenever they 
can.   EXBS feels that the Train-The-Trainer approach would solve 
this problem. On the more technical equipment, subject matter 
experts will be required to conduct training on the radiation and 
metal detection/identification devices.  Once a source for this 
training has been identified and the training completed, this 
equipment can be fielded immediately following training.  The EXBS 
office continues to work with ISN/ECC to find an acceptable source 
for this training.  Getting the equipment handed off is a top EXBS 
priority. 
 
III. RED FLAG ISSUES: 
 
¶1. (U) No Red Flag Issues to report.
