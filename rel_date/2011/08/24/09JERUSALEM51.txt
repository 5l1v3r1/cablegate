¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  PA Cabinet Minister Tahani Abu Daqqa 
(please protect) told PD chief she greatly fears for the 
safety of her family in Gaza, who are sheltered in a single 
home in Abasan village. On the night of January 5, Israeli 
missiles struck the center of the village, shattering all 
the windows in the home of Abu Daqqa's parents. Abu Daqqa 
said she and others in Gaza are desperate for an end to the 
fighting.  END SUMMARY. 
¶2. (SBU) In a conversation with PD chief, Minister f Youth and 
Sport and Minister of Culture TahaniAbu Daqqa expressed great fear 
over the safety o her son, parents, sister, and sister's family, 
ll sheltered in a single home in Abasan village insouthern Gaza. 
Abu Daqqa, a native of Gaza, movedto Ramallah in July 2007 when she 
joined Prime Mnister Fayyad's cabinet.  Her 16-year-old son 
susequently returned to Gaza to complete high schoolin Abasan. 
 
¶3. (SBU) After Israeli military opertions in Gaza began, Abu Daqqa 
ordered her son to evacuate her home on the edge of Abasan village,and move to 
her parents' home in the village cente.  She feared her 
home would be caught in the fihting, as Hamas fighters occupy the 
village outsirts.  Abu Daqqa said her fears were confirmed when 
Israeli tanks moved into the area.  She said the now occupy the 
area around her home. 
 
¶4. (SBU On the night of January 5, Abu Daqqa said the vilage 
center was rocketed, and that she now fears er entire family is in 
harm's way.  Her parents' home is still intact, but all the windows 
were blwn out in the rocket assault.  Abu Daqqa characterized the 
rocket barrage as "random" and said her family has seen no Hamas 
fighters inside the village.  Before the rocket assault began, Abu 
Daqqa's parents received a phone call from the IDF advising them to 
leave their home, but, having nowhere to go, they stayed.  Other 
residents of the neighborhood received the same calls. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Living in a village, Abu Daqqa's family does have access to 
food, water, and fuel (wood) for cooking.  She said it is easier for 
villagers, who are farmers and can provide for themselves.  She has 
been in touch with friends in cities, such as Beit Lahiya and Beit 
Hanun, who report they are without food, water, and electricity. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Audibly upset, Abu Daqqa said she wants the fighting to be 
over.  She agonizes over what to do about her son.  She has 
considered asking for a permit for him to come to Ramallah, but 
fears for his safety traveling to Erez crossing.  She said cannot 
feel good about him staying in a village that is being rocketed and 
is surrounded by Israeli tanks, but cannot feel good about him on 
the roads, which are also rocketed.  She expressed frustration that 
families who do not support Hamas are suffering greatly under the 
Israeli assault. 
 
¶7. (U) Note: Abu Daqqa has been the PA's point person on the 
U.S.-Palestinian Partnership, a public-private initiative launched 
in 2007 with Secretary Rice.
