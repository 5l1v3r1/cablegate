SUBJECT: ESF FUNDING CRITICAL TO COMBATING TIP IN TURKEY 
 
REF: ANKARA 3186 
 
¶1.  Summary:  In FY 2004, we gave the International Office 
for Migration (IOM) a grant of $600,000 from ESF to assist 
with their efforts to combat trafficking in persons (TIP) in 
Turkey.  With that $600,000 ESF allocation, the IOM has made 
a world of difference in Turkey's fight against trafficking 
in persons (TIP).  Thanks largely to these efforts, Turkey 
moved up to Tier 2.  However, much remains to be done in this 
fight, and additional funding is imperative to continue this 
good work, and further this important USG priority in Turkey. 
 End summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
What has our $600,000 bought? 
----------------------------- 
 
Protection 
---------- 
 
¶2.  Turkey is the number one destination country in the 
region.  The IOM has used one-third of the $600,000 grant for 
direct assistance to victims of trafficking (VOTs). 
According to IOM Strategic Consultant Allan Freedman, the 
best way to prevent re-trafficking is through direct 
assistance programs.  Without intervention, the rate of 
re-trafficking of victims is 25 percent; with IOM 
interventin, the rate plummets to three percent.  The IOM 
has a network of rehabilitation centers in Belarus, Ukraine 
and Moldova already in place. 
 
Prosecution 
----------- 
 
¶3.  IOM organized training of Jandarma and judiciary in 
high-trafficking areas in Turkey (Istanbul, Antalya and 
Trabzon) on identification procedures and implementation of 
the new penal code.  IOM has also set up the first pro bono 
attorneys' list in Turkey under the auspices of the Ankara 
Bar.  Until now, Turkey's answer to TIP has been deportation. 
 A trafficker cannot be prosecuted without a witness, and 
their victims -- with legal assistance, remaining in-country 
-- are the best witnesses. 
 
¶4.  IOM has worked on international law enforcement 
cooperation initiatives, which benefit not only the fight 
against TIP, but also the fight against terrorism.  As it 
turns out many of the law enforcement issues (failure to 
respond or supply complete information, stovepiping of 
agencies) are similar. 
 
Prevention 
---------- 
 
¶5.  ESF moneys have funded the implementation of a major 
international (Turkey, Ukraine, Moldova) public awareness 
campaign, including television and print media advertisements 
of Turkey's "157" victim hotline.  The hotline, also started 
up and run, thanks to ESF money, is staffed 24/7 by Russian, 
Romanian, Turkish and English-speaking operators, and has 
netted 50 rescues of VOTs since its May 23 inauguration. 
Posters and passport inserts advertising the hotline are on 
display at all regional Turkish consulates and Turkish, 
Moldovan and Ukrainian ports of entry.  (See reftel.) 
 
¶6.  IOM is readying a new campaign, including powerful 
television commercials, to appeal to the Turkish public's 
importance of family values in response to the 2005 TIP 
Report call for a continuation and expansion of Turkish 
public awareness. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
New Funding Needed to Continue Project 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  According to Freedman, the IOM is out of money for this 
project.  Without additional funding, the direct assistance 
network will collapse; in turn, VOTs will not be protected. 
Work on international law enforcement cooperation will cease. 
 There will be little to no hope for effective prosecutions 
absent witnesses.  Due to lack of NGO interest, the 157 
hotline tender produced no bidders.  Without further funding, 
IOM will have to pull the plug on 157. 
 
¶8.  TIP is an international problem and combating it a 
Mission Turkey MPP priority.  Without international support 
and partnerships, Turkey would be in a far worse shape on 
this issue.  The impact that the relatively small amount of 
ESF grant has made is great.  Thanks to that contribution, we 
are seeing progress and meeting benchmarks.  TIP is an area 
where the U.S. is helping save lives with small amounts of 
money and an example of the uses to which continued ESF could 
be put.
