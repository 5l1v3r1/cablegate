Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The government announced on January 9 the removal of 
Baghlan governor Mohammad Alam Ishaqzai, who had been 
suspended pending the results of the investigation into the 
November 6 Baghlan bombing, and his replacement with 
new-comer Abdul Jabar Haqbin.  The government also confirmed 
publicly the appointment of Juma Khan Hamdard as governor of 
Paktya.  The Independent Directorate for Local Governace 
(IDLG) is also planning a new appointment in Farah, and 
continues recruiting candidates for Helmand. 
 
New Baghlan Governor, Fallout from Bombing Continues 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The government announced on January 9 the 
appointment of a new governor for Baghlan province, Abdul 
Jabar Haqbin, to replace Mohammad Alam Ishakzai, who was 
suspended following the November 6 Baghlan bombing and 
remains under investigation (ref A).  Haqbin is a Tajik from 
Nahrin District, Baghlan province.  He graduated from the 
Economics Faculty of Kabul University and lived abroad under 
the Taliban.  Upon his return, he was the head of a bank in 
northeastern Afghanistan.  He then served for one year as 
head of the finance department in Baghlan province, then in 
the same job in Kunduz province.  He is reportedly a member 
of Minister of Finance Ahady's Afghan Millat Party, of which 
Local Governance director Popal is the deputy. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Independent Directorate for Local Governance deputy 
Barna Karimi told POLoff that President Karzai reluctantly 
replaced Ishaqzai in the face of continuing Parliamentary 
scrutiny of the Baghlan bombing.  The IDLG presented Karzai 
with four candidates and Karzai chose Haqbin, a promising 
technocrat.  Ishaqzai told POLoff following his dismissal 
that he remained under investigation and hoped to receive 
another government job once cleared by the investigation. 
 
Controversial Appointee Hamdard Confirmed in Paktya 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) The government also publically confirmed private 
reports of the appointment of Juma Khan Hamdard as governor 
of Paktya province, replacing Rahmatullah Rahmat (ref B).  A 
Pashtun from Balkh province, Hamdard was a top Hezb-i Islami 
Gulbuddin (HiG) commander in the north who acted as the 
intermediary between Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Uzbek commander 
Abdul Rashid Dostum when the two were allied against the 
Soviets and later against the Taliban.  Dostum appointed 
Hamdard commander of the 8th Corps upon Hamdard's return to 
Balkh after the fall of the Taliban.  Hamdard cooperated with 
President Karzai on disarmament and was subsequently 
appointed governor of Baghlan, but he was expelled following 
Tajik protests of his attempts to distribute land to Pashtuns 
from other provinces.  Karzai then appointed him governor of 
Jowzjan, where he followed Karzai's direction in 
marginalizing Dostum in his home province, again leading to 
his expulsion by Junbesh Party members loyal to Dostum. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Hamdard is controversial among non-Pashtuns in the 
north.  His candidacy for his third governorship was 
reportedly supported by other former HiG members in the 
Karzai administration, notably Minister of Parliamentary 
Affairs and Senior Advisor Farook Wardak.  He has less 
support from other presidential advisors, one of whom 
asserted the appointment to Paktya was a step to Hamdard's 
marginalization.  In addition to his governorship, Hamdard is 
one of President Karzai's seven advisors on tribal issues, a 
role he shares with Helmand governor Wafa.  Regardless of how 
long he remains governor of Paktya, he will to continue to 
enjoy a position close to the Palace. 
 
More Changes Anticipated In Farah and Helmand

--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  IDLG deputy Karimi told POLoff that the IDLG also 
plans to replace Farah governor Mawlawi Mohideen Balouch in 
the next month.  IDLG director Jelani Popal is courting two 
candidates to replace Helmand governor Asadullah Wafa, but 
Karimi said they both are demanding promises of considerable 
rewards if successful in the difficult post, such as a 
ministerial appointment, and President Karzai is reluctant to 
agree.
