SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON U.S. CANDIDATE FOR CODEX VICE CHAIR 
 
REF: (A) BERLIN 2225 (B) STATE 120306 
 
Per ref (B), Embassy delivered demarche to Juan Carlos Calvo 
(Chef de Cabinet for the InterMinisterial Commission on Food 
Safety Regulation - Calvo is with the Spanish Food Safety 
Agency, which has the lead on Codex issues), Jose Perez 
Lazaro (Deputy Director for International Relations, Ministry 
of Health), Teresa Zapatero (Subdirector for Inspections and 
Technical Assistance, Ministry of Industry, Tourism and 
Trade), and Ana Villauriz (Deputy Director General of the 
Interntional Relations Department,Ministry of Agriculture). 
Calvo was the most open with EconOff.  He said he had already 
received from the EU Dr.Hulebak's CV plus USG positions on 
Codex issues.  He said he was impressed with Dr. Hulebak's 
CV.  He mentioned that there was a Dutch candidate (see ref 
A).  Calvo told EconOff that there were, as far as he knew, 
only two declared candidates for the three ViceChair 
positions, and that it was likely Dr. Hulebak would get one 
of the positions.  However, Calvo would not be drawn into a 
discussion of Spain's likely posture should there be more 
than three candidates for the three ViceChair jobs.  Calvo 
will be attending the Codex meeting.
