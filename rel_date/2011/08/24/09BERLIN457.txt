REF: A. STATE 35774

¶1.  (SBU) Econoff met with Joerg Polster, German MFA desk 
officer for International Nuclear Energy to discuss issues 
raised in Ref A.  Polster stated he was not familiar with the 
issue, as it predated his tenure in his current position by 
several years.  As the German MFA point of contact, per Ref 
B, was the "Office of Civilian Energy", Polster agreed that 
his office had responsibility for the issue.  Polster stated 
that he would consult with his colleagues, review the history 
of this matter and advise on the future of the permits. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Polster also noted that, in 2003, Germany's ruling 
coalition (Social Democrats - Greens) was more liberal than 
today's Social Democrat - Christian Democrat coalition. 
Based on that, he opined that it should be at least as easy 
to get government permits for this program today as in 2003. 
He further advised caution against calling the subject 
materials "waste" or "tailings", as these are "magic words" 
that might cause unwanted scruitny, recommending instead 
"glass", "ash" or "residue". 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Polster stated he would convey the results of his 
consultations to Econoff when they are available.  Post will 
report further on this septel.
