Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The growing influence of United Russia and the extent to 
which the ruling party is pre-positioning itself for the December 
Duma elections was evident in Voronezh during an August 6-8 visit to 
the region (ref A). While the regional election commission chairman 
and NGOs described their working relationship as positive, the 
chairman's recent decision to join United Russia has cast doubt on 
his objectivity.  At least one NGO has dismissed participating in 
election observations, claiming that the outcome was predetermined. 
End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Election Commission Chairman Selyanin 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Vladimir Selyanin has been the chairman of Voronezh 
Oblast's election commission since 1993.  His reputation for 
fairness was recently questioned by the news that he had joined the 
United Russia party.  He told us that his goal was to increase voter 
participation from an already respectable 60-65 percent to 75-80 
percent in the December Duma elections.  He was somewhat dismissive 
of the new Central Election Commission Chairman Vladimir Churov, who 
has been criticized for his lack of experience, and said "we will 
follow the requirements of the law, not what the chairman says." 
 
¶3. (SBU) Selyanin told us that the Voronezh region welcomed election 
monitors because they are essential in ensuring free and fair 
elections, and noted that he has had much experience with them in 
the region.  He expressed concern about having "too much of a good 
thing" by citing an example from the last election where one polling 
station had 56 monitors watching it. 
 
-------------------------- 
NGOs and Election Monitors 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Natalia Zvyagina, the regional coordinator of the 
election-monitoring NGO Golos ("Vote") told us that the Voronezh 
election commission is an exception in this oblast administration, 
which has largely been closed off to them.  She said that her 
relationship with Selyanin was good, and that he regularly meets 
with Golos and other NGOs to explain changes in election law. 
Russian law currently allows only representatives of political 
parties and journalists to serve as monitors in the December 
elections, and, as in other regions throughout Russia, Golos is 
preparing to publish an election-monitoring "journal" and have its 
activists monitor the elections as journalists.  The downside to 
this strategy, Zvyagina claimed, is that journalists are only 
allowed to observe, not to file complaints. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Another NGO representative we met with had no interest in 
the elections or taking part as a monitor.  "What's to monitor? The 
outcome is already known," stated Andrey Yurov of Youth Human Rights 
Movement (YHRM).  Yurov has recently appealed to a Nizhniy Novgorod 
court to reverse the de-registration of YHRM (Ref B).

Election Commission Chair Joins United Russia 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Subsequent to our meeting with Election Commission Chairman 
Selyanin, we were told by several NGO representatives, including 
Golos, that the chairman had joined United Russia the week before. 
They suspected that he had been given the choice of joining the 
dominant party or losing the job that he has held for 14 years. 
Whether he did it under pressure or of his own volition, they said, 
still revealed the growing influence of the United Russia party in 
regional politics. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) As detailed in Ref A, United Russia dominates the political 
scene in Voronezh.  By adding the regional election commission 
chairman to their ranks, the party has undermined the integrity of 
one of the only independent authorities in the region.  Whether this 
will have a practical effect on the election results remains to be 
seen, but the skepticism that such a maneuver invites damages the 
credibility of the elections.
