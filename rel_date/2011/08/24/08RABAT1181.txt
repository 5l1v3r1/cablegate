Summary:

¶1.  (SBU) The second annual Middle East Partnership 
Initiative (MEPI) Leaders for Democracy Fellowship (LDF) 
Alumni Meeting took place in Marrakech, Morocco December 
15-17.  The DCM opened the event that brought together 28 LDF 
alumni from 13 countries in the Middle East and North Africa 
(MENA) region.  Most participants felt that U.S. foreign 
policy in the region would remain the same and that the new 
administration would focus its attention on U.S. domestic 
issues.  Iran also figured prominently, with participants 
questioning the role Russia would play in the region and 
Saudi Arabia and Turkey's reactions to Iran's possibly 
becoming a nuclear power.  End summary.

DCM Jackson Opens Event 
----------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On December 15, Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) 
Robert Jackson opened the second annual LDF Alumni Meeting, 
co-sponsored by MEPI and Syracuse University's Maxwell School 
of Citizenship and Public Affairs, with a speech on the state 
of MEPI's four pillars:  democracy, economic development, 
education, and women's empowerment.  Twenty-eight 
participants representing 13 countries were present for the 
three-day event.  This year's LDF Alumni Meeting brought 
together participants from Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, 
Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia, Yemen, and the West Bank.

Purpose of the LDF Program and Alumni Conference 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The LDF program annually brings 20-25 persons from 
across the Middle East and North Africa to the United States 
for a three-month program that combines academic coursework 
at Syracuse University and an internship experience at a 
public institution in Washington DC.  The program is 
administered by the Maxwell School of Syracuse University in 
close collaboration with MEPI program staff.  The third class 
of LDF participants are in the process of receiving 
invitations and beginning their visa application process to 
begin in March 2009.  Morocco will have two participants in 
the 2009 LDF class, including the first Saharawi 
representative in the program. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) This conference provided an opportunity for alumni 
across the MENA region to reunite with classmates and to get 
acquainted with participants from different years.  The 
intentions of the alumni meeting were to facilitate a bonding 
experience among the group and to have substantive 
discussions about democracy in the Middle East and the 
potential impact of a new administration on U.S. Middle East 
policy as well as to provide an opportunity for participants 
to learn more about MEPI initiatives and ways in which to 
network with other MEPI programs in the region. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Pessimistic View of Obama's Impact on MENA Policy 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) One of the most interesting discussions among the 
group occurred during the second day of the conference when 
Syracuse University LDF Director Steve Lux conducted an 
unscientific poll among the participants on the impact of the 
Obama administration on U.S. Middle East policy.  Sixty-nine 
percent of the participants said that their respective 
governments were undecided about whether or not they were 
happy that Obama will be the next U.S. president.  One 
hundred percent of the participants claimed that the citizens 
of their countries were happy to see Obama win the election. 
However, 63 percent of those polled felt that the Obama 
administration would not have a positive impact on MENA 
policy.  Most participants felt that U.S. Foreign Policy in 
the region would remain the same and that the new 
administration would focus its attention on U.S. domestic 
issues such as the economic crisis and healthcare. 
 
------------------------ 
Iran Dominates Q/A Time 
------------------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) During one of the Question and Answer sessions, 
Iran dominated the conversation.  Participants questioned the 
role Russia would play in the region and the reactions of 
Saudi Arabia and Turkey if Iran became a nuclear power. 
There was concern that a U.S. agreement to negotiate with 
Iran would make the Iranian government become more arrogant 
and some suggested that it would be better for Obama to wait 
until after the 2009 Iranian elections to begin bi-lateral 
discussions.

Comment 
-------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The Mission values the efforts of the LDF program 
and sees value in bringing together young, democratic 
reformers from throughout the region.  While there was some 
substantive dialogue during the alumni conference, the 
Mission urges that the model used for other MEPI alumni 
events be used for the next LDF meeting, i.e., a detailed 
agenda with more interactive workshops coordinated in 
partnership with the host embassy.  End Comment.
