¶1. (SBU) Polchief delivered reftel demarche Nov. 19 to Jukka 
Pietikainen, Director of the Finnish MFA's Unit for Latin 
America.  Pietikainen said that the UK had initially 
circulated a draft statement to EU partners condemning the 
Chavez Regime's proposed constitutional reforms in strong 
terms and calling for greater respect for democracy, civil 
society, and personal freedoms.  However, Spain, Italy  and 
Portugal, among others, will not support such a harshly 
worded public statement, so the UK has now offered "more 
balanced" statement that Finland hopes will win support from 
those member states.  Finland supported the initial 
statement, Pietikainen said, believing that the EU has 
achieved very little impact through "silent diplomacy" with 
the Chavez government, and that the time for more robust 
public diplomacy is at hand.  However, he added, Finland will 
also support the new draft statement in the hopes of winning 
EU consensus. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On the bilateral level, Pietikainen -- who had just 
returned from Venezuela the day before -- said that Finland's 
small embassy in Caracas had been active in vocally 
supporting civil society and Venezuelan NGOs, but that other 
resident EU member state Embassies were not comfortable with 
public statements.  He fully shared our concerns about limits 
on NGOs, the decline in free speech, and Chavez's increasing 
support to militias.  However, because the Finns have limited 
bilateral access to the GOV, it still remains it their 
interest to work within the EU as well, Pietikainen added.
