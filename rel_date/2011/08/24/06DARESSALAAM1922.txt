EFFORTS FOR DARFUR 
 
REF: STATE 195763 
 
(SBU) On December 8, the DCM, together with the British 
Deputy High Commissioner, stressed to Mr. S.M.K. Sella, Head 
of International Development Cooperation at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, the urgency of a United Nations assessment 
mission to Darfur and support for the Finnish draft 
resolution.  Sella said that this would be the "right course" 
and that "anything toward peace in Darfur, Tanzania is for." 
The DCM highlighted the positive influence which Tanzania 
could yield in urging other African states to address the 
dire situation in Darfur and ultimately, in upholding the 
credibility of the Human Rights Council.  Mr. Sella thanked 
the DCM for giving Tanzania this credit and promised to work 
immediately since the December 12 Special Session on Sudan 
was "just around the corner."
