OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
¶1.  Massive government expenditures, excess liquidity, and a 
consumption boom have led to high economic growth rates for 
the last fourteen consecutive quarters.  These same 
tendencies have contributed to inflation rates nearing 20 
percent a year and inflation shows no sign of declining, 
despite the government's efforts.  As government accounts 
become less transparent and institutions like the Central 
Bank and the National Statistics Institute lose autonomy, 
figures and methods have become untrustworthy.  A weakening 
investment climate has led to capital outflows in recent 
years and the overvalued official exchange rate encourages 
imports and discourages domestic industry.  Debt levels are 
relatively low and the balance of payments and foreign 
exchange reserves will remain manageable unless oil prices or 
production fall.  Government intervention continues to affect 
the financial sector and private sector  institutions are 
under threat. 
 
--------------- 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
--------------- 
 
¶2. The Venezuelan economy has grown consistently during the 
past fourteen consecutive quarters.  GDP grew 10.3 percent 
(in real terms) in both 2005 and 2006 and has grown 8.8 
percent thus far in 2007.  Non-oil economic activities such 
as finance (26 percent), communications (18 percent), 
commerce (21 percent), transportation (16 percent), and 
construction (27 percent) have grown faster than other 
sectors.  This positive trend has been driven by the huge 
increase in government expenditures made possible by windfall 
oil profits.  On the other hand, the oil sector has 
contracted during the past two years (the Central Bank 
calculates oil sector GDP with constant prices, so changes do 
not reflect changes in the price of oil).  During the first 
quarter of 2007 oil sector GDP decreased by 5.6 percent.  We 
expect the Venezuelan economy to grow between 6-8 percent in 
real terms in 2007.

UNEMPLOYMENT 
------------ 
 
¶3. According to government statistics, the unemployment rate 
has fallen precipitously in recent years in line with GDP 
growth.  Unemployment figures have been questionable since 
the National Statistics Institute (INE) changed its (still 
unpublished) methodology in 2000.  Similarly, poverty figures 
have been unreliable since methodological changes in 2005 and 
there are concerns that inflation data will be affected by 
plans to change measurements in the third quarter of 2007. 
Since 2005, unemployment has reportedly fallen by more than 
five percentage points, although most attribute this decline 
to reductions in the labor force, rather than increases in 
employment (reftel F).  The informal sector has also been 
decreasing in size, amounting to 44 percent of total 
employees (11.2 million) during May 2007.  INE recently 
announced a new change to its methodology, which will reduce 
the informal sector to around 34 percent of the labor force. 
Government social programs (missions) reduce unemployment 
figures by removing participants from the labor force and 
estimates are that the missions currently "employ" around 
five percent of the labor force.

INTERNATIONAL RESERVES 
---------------------- 
 
¶4. International reserves have decreased by almost USD 12 
billion during 2007 because of the USD 6.8 billion transfer 
of funds from the Central Bank (BCV) to the National 
Development Fund (FONDEN) in February (USD 2 billion), March 
(USD 2.5 billion), and April (USD 2.3 billion) of 2007.  In 
addition, PDVSA's USD 7.5 billion bond issuance in April 2007 
drew down reserves as PDSVA converted the Bolivars earned 
from the sale into dollars (reftel A).  Increases in imports 
have also contributed to this decrease as has the decision to 
maintain PDVSA's dollar earnings in special 
dollar-denominated treasury accounts.  Since its inception in 
2005, FONDEN has received upwards of USD 17 billion in 
transfers from the BCV.  The allocations of these funds and 
their uses are mostly unknown due to the severe lack of 
transparency regarding FONDEN's activities.

MONEY SUPPLY/M2 
--------------- 
 
¶5. Money supply growth during the last four years has 
increased inflationary pressures.  In part to reduce excess 
liquidity, state-owned oil company PDVSA issued bonds worth 
USD 7.5 billion in April 2007 (reftel A).  The issuance 
didn't have the desired effect on liquidity as banks were 
able to fund the purchases by redeeming money held in 
BCV-issued certificates of deposit (reftel B).  As such, 
liquidity was hardly affected.  On July 10, 2007, the BCV's 
board of directors increased minimum interest rates on 
savings accounts from 6.5 percent to 8 percent, and raised 
legal reserve requirements from 15 percent to 17 percent, 
hoping to reduce liquidity.  Most experts do not expect these 
measures to have a significant effect.

¶6. Foreign exchange controls have been in place since 
February 2003, and the current fixed exchange rate of 2,150 
Bolivars per dollar since March 2005.  At the same time, the 
spread between the official rate and that obtained in the 
unregulated parallel market has grown from around 20 percent 
to over 90 percent.   According to the Minister of Finance 
Rodrigo Cabezas, the BRV will not devalue the currency for 
the foreseeable future.  Most economists believe that the BRV 
will have to devalue when oil prices decline, or when 
 
CARACAS 00001416  004 OF 009 
 
 
expenditures exceed revenues such that devaluation becomes 
necessary to maintain the public sector.  Distortions in the 
Venezuelan economy continue to increase, and the longer the 
BRV postpones devaluation, the greater the cost of the 
adjustment will be for the economy.  Daily BCV liquidations 
so far in 2007 are USD 156 million, as of July 6, 2007.  This 
represents an increase of 48.6 percent over the daily average 
in 2006.

CONSUMER PRICE INDEX 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. The government's inflation target for the year was 
recently revised from 12 to 14 percent.  However, the current 
yearly inflation rate is almost 20 percent and inflation in 
Venezuela typically increases over the course of the year. 
Price controls in force since 2003, a reduction in the value 
added tax (IVA) from 14 percent to 9 percent, massive 
importation, and increases in reserve requirements have had 
limited effects in reducing inflation.  The oil bonanza and 
associated consumption boom continue to offset anti-inflation 
measures.  There are also shortages of basic food items, 
including milk, meat, beans, sugar, and chicken, as well as 
construction materials, vehicle parts, and medicines (reftel 
E).

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS 
------------------- 
 
¶8. The negative capital account balance is expected to reach 
a record high in 2007 and international reserves are 
estimated to fall by as much as USD 10 billion.  The public 
sector increase in foreign assets and the amount of private 
sector capital flight will exceed the expected positive 
current account balance (mainly from oil sales).  The balance 
of payments deficit may already be greater than it appears as 
the official numbers imply oil revenues that far exceed most 
private estimates of Venezuelan production.  If the negative 
overall balance of payment continues, it will become harder 
to maintain the current exchange rate (reftel D).

MERCHANDISE TRADE BALANCE 
------------------------- 
 
¶9. The overvaluation of the national currency along with 
liquidity increases has caused huge increases in imports and 
the reduction of non-oil exports.  The United States remains 
Venezuelan's largest trading partner, representing almost 50 
percent of total trade during 2006, followed by Colombia (6.2 
percent), and Mexico (4.9 percent).  Although the BRV is 
trying to diversify its trading partners, historical 
relationships and strong commercial ties make it difficult 
for the BRV to do so.

FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT 
------------------------- 
 
¶10. Foreign direct investment in Venezuela continues to 
decrease.  The socialist project that the BRV is trying to 
impose, the announced constitutional changes (reftel G), and 
the uncertain political and economic future, have restrained 
investors from making new investments.  On the contrary, some 
foreign companies have decided to sell their assets in 
Venezuela and to move abroad.

CARACAS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX 
---------------------------- 
 
¶11. The Caracas Stock Exchange has been negatively affected 
by the nationalization of the largest telecommunications 
company CANTV and the main electrical utility EDC.  Combined, 
these companies represented around 30 percent of all 
securities traded on the exchange, and often represented over 
50 percent of daily volumes.  Continual harassment of the 
private sector and increased political and economic 
uncertainty, coupled with nationalizations and presidential 
announcements such as the plans to withdraw from the IMF have 
all contributed to the negative behavior of the 
capitalization index.  Venezuelan steel company, Sivensa, now 
represents almost half of the exchange and what was already a 
small capital market continues to shrink.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶12. The BRV has been trying to avoid monetization of 
extraordinary oil revenues through the creation of two 
dollar-denominated accounts at the National Treasury Office. 
The accumulation amounted to over USD 7 billion as of July 
12, 2007.  The diversion of funds from the Central Bank has 
 
CARACAS 00001416  007 OF 009 
 
 
temporarily decreased petroleum revenues and is in part 
responsible for the central government's deficit during the 
first quarter of 2007.  These funds are converted to Bolivars 
at the Central Bank as they are needed by PDVSA to pay 
expenses.  Non-oil revenues represented 57 percent of 
ordinary spending during January-April 2007.  Total central 
government expenditures grew by 9.2 percent in real terms 
during the same period.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT DEBT 
----------------------- 
 
¶13. Central government debt levels have been stable during 
the last four years.  Public credit officials at the Ministry 
of Finance told Econoffs that they will continue to 
reschedule debt during 2007, buying back the most expensive 
debt first.  At the same time, state-owned oil company PDVSA 
has been increasing its external debt.  Thus far in 2007, 
PDVSA has issued over USD 12.5 billion in dollar-denominated 
debt, presumably to continue to finance government social 
programs and maintain transfers to FONDEN (reftel C).

BANKING SYSTEM 
-------------- 
 
¶15. This is one of the economic sectors that has grown 
fastest during the last four years.  Banks in Venezuela have 
 
CARACAS 00001416  008 OF 009 
 
 
been actively financing the consumption boom.  Loans for 
cars, homes, and credit cards have doubled in less than two 
years.  Financial sector returns exceed 30 percent and 
business is booming.  In part because of perceived "excess 
profits," the government has been threatening the financial 
sector with profit caps and potential nationalization.  To 
date, most of the pressure has been in the form of fixed 
interest rates, directed lending requirements, and tax 
increases.

INTEREST RATES 
-------------- 
 
¶16. On July 10, 2007, the BCV issued a resolution changing 
maximum and minimum interest rates for lending (28 percent) 
and savings (8 percent).  Also, certificates of deposit 
issued by financial institutions now must pay at least 11 
percent interest, and the certificates of deposit issued by 
the BCV will pay 10 percent with a maturity of 28 days, and 
11 percent for those maturing in 56 days.  By reducing 
financial margins, bank profits may fall in the short term.
