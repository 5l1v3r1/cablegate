SUBJECT: TRAINING FOR COMMISSION ON INTEGRITY INVESTIGATORS 
IS A HIT IN TIKRIT 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  With the expanded capacity of Iraq's 
primary anti-corruption enforcement agency, the Commission on 
Integrity (COI), the U.S. has begun working with the agency's 
managers to extend training programs for investigators in 
selected provincial locations.  The first session was 
delivered by instructors from the DOJ International Criminal 
Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) funded by 
INL and hosted by Salah ad Din Provincial Reconstruction Team 
(PRT) in November 21-25, 2009 and represents an important 
expansion of the COI's legitimacy and capacity.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The COI, along with Iraqi Ministry Inspectors 
General, is the principal enforcer of Iraq,s anti-corruption 
laws.  Established in 2004, COI is an independent 
governmental body charged with prevention, public education, 
legislative engagement and enforcement of corruption laws. 
Since mid-2004, the U.S. has provided extensive assistance, 
including management and investigative training for COI 
personnel designed and implemented by ICITAP advisors and 
funded by INL. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Since the appointment of  COI Commissioner Judge 
Raheem Hasan Al-Ugaily in 2007, ICITAP has been expanding 
COI's capacity to design and conduct its own training 
programs and, beginning in October 2009, COI agreed to 
ICITAP's recommendations to expand investigative training 
programs to COI offices in the provinces.  Although the COI 
established provincial offices (beginning with the branch 
office set up in Basra in 2004), provincial programs, 
staffing, and equipment have always lagged behind investments 
in the Baghdad central office. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The city of Tikrit, in Salah ad Din Province, was 
chosen by COI as the site for the first of three provincial 
training sessions, and training was carried out from November 
21-25, 2009.  The session was hosted by Salah ad Din PRT and 
facilitated by the PRT,s DOJ Office of Overseas 
Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) 
Resident Legal Advisor.  A two-member ICITAP Team provided 
instruction and materials for 21 COI participants from 
Ninewa, Kirkuk and Salah ad Din, all of whom successfully 
completed the course.  Feedback from COI students was 
overwhelmingly positive with demand for more of this type of 
training.  Subject to Commissioner Raheem,s approval, the 
training program will be repeated for COI offices in Basra in 
February 2010 and Najaf in March 2010. 
 
¶5. (SBU) ICITAP COI program staffing consists of eight 
technical advisors and trainers.  The staffing levels will 
remain constant through May 30, 2010, when the program draws 
down to 3 advisors who will conclude the overall program by 
March 31, 2011.  Between December 2009 and May 2010, ICITAP 
will present training courses for the COI in Non-Governmental 
Organizations, Inspections & Audits, Computer Crimes & 
Computer Forensics, Terrorist Financial Fraud, White Collar 
Crime Investigations, Use of Advanced Technologies, 
Undercover Operations and Financial Crimes Investigations. 
From June 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011, the ICITAP advisors 
will focus primarily on advising and mentoring for COI 
officials in Baghdad, and will not conduct training sessions.
