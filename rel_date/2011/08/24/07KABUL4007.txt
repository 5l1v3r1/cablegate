SUBJECT:  FOOD PRICE INCREASES CAUSE CONSTERNATION IN THE AFGHAN 
GENERAL PUBLIC 
 
 
¶1.  Summary.  Prices for household staples have risen across 
Afghanistan, driven primarily by worldwide increases in prices of 
key commodities.  Even Afghans with "good" jobs have found 
themselves caught between rising food prices and flat salaries. 
Price increases are having a negative effect on popular satisfaction 
with the government. End summary. 
 
¶2.  Official Afghan Central Bank statistics, based upon figures for 
Kabul, show that the end-of-period, year-on-year overall Consumer 
Price Index rose 9.5 percent between October 2006 and October 2007. 
Prices of non-food items, such as housing (including rents), 
electricity and fuels, transportation, health care, and education 
increased only 2.4 percent in the similar period, suggesting that, 
while Afghans are feeling the pinch, the country as a whole is not 
facing significant monetary inflation[O1]. 
 
¶3.  The price increases in Afghanistan reflect worldwide trends: 
global wheat prices are double what they were last year. 
Additionally, in regard to price indices, the World Bank reports 
that for the July-September 2007 quarter, compared to the same 
quarter in 2006, energy rose 7 percent on average, agriculture rose 
17 percent, food price rose 27 percent, and the grains price index 
rose 24 percent. 
 
¶4.  Although Cabinet officials regularly try to talk down prices and 
threaten price controls, the free market is a fact of life in 
Afghanistan.  This is not widely viewed as a universal good; 
newspaper editorials decry price rises and criticize Ministers for 
"permitting" price increases to occur.  On November 28 a number of 
MPs called on the Minister of Commerce and Industry to impose price 
controls and demanded that he appear to answer questions.  For his 
part the Minister has told the embassy that he opposes price 
controls on key staples, but he has also been widely quoted as 
saying that food prices should be controlled.  (Note:  In September, 
the Charge sent a letter to the Minster of Finance urging the 
government not to institute price controls.) 
 
¶5.  Market basket surveys conducted by Provincial Reconstruction 
Teams suggest that prices of some consumer staples have risen 
sharply in the past month.  Reporting for the September through 
November 2007 period from Kunduz and Laghman provinces shows that 
the price of rice rose 14% in Laghman and the price of sugar there 
rose almost 75%.  Some key prices, however, such as propane and 
firewood have not changed over the survey period, although all 
energy prices are high, compared to average incomes. 
 
¶6.  In a recent conversation with the Political Counselor, the 
Governor of Ghazni compared the cost of a market basket of household 
staples to the average salary of a policeman or soldier, noting that 
even those with relatively good wage-paying jobs have no margin. 
Even a modest increase in the price of essentials means some items 
are no longer affordable.  The burden is even heavier on those who 
do not receive regular wage payments. 
 
¶7.  What we hear on the street is that price rises are increasingly 
hard for Afghans to bear.  The difficult fact is that as food prices 
rise and median incomes remain flat, Afghans will feel increasingly 
squeezed.  This will both increase pressure on the government, while 
also leading to more popular complaints about the relative 
invisibility of the billions of dollars in assistance provided by 
the international community.
