Six-Party Talks, Wu-Chun Meeting 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. At the December 13 regular MFA press briefing, spokesman 
Qin Gang confirmed that VFM Wu Dawei and ROK Ambassador Chun 
Yung-woo met this morning to discuss the Six-Party Talks and 
the "next stage of work."  Asked about the meeting on 
economic and energy aid to the DPRK, Qin referred reporters 
to the ROK side, as the ROK chaired the meeting.  Qin warned 
that the Six-Party Talks process will encounter difficulties 
along the way, but expressed optimism on the positive efforts 
of all parties and continuous progress made.  Asked about VFM 
Wu Dawei's upcoming trip to the DPRK, the spokesman replied 
that the details were still under discussion. 
 
Sudan Government Must Ensure Chinese Citizens' Safety 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3. China hopes the Sudan Government can take measures to 
ensure the safety of Chinese citizens in Sudan, said Qin in 
response to a question regarding a recent attack on a 
Chinese-run oil field by Sudanese rebels.  Chinese companies 
play an active role in improving the lives of the Sudanese, 
Qin stated.  Therefore, he added, threats to the safety and 
welfare of Chinese people in Sudan are unacceptable.  Qin 
noted that the MFA released a statement yesterday on the 
incident. 
 
Dalai Lama Visits Italy 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. China opposes any country which in any form "supports or 
sympathizes" with the Dalai Lama's activities, said Qin when 
asked about the Dalai Lama's current visit to Italy.  The 
Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but rather a 
political figure engaged in activities aimed at "splitting 
the motherland." 
 
70th Anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. China commemorates today, the seventieth anniversary of 
the "Nanjing Massacre," for the benefit of history, said the 
spokesman when a reporter raised the topic.  Qin promoted 
"taking history as a mirror for the benefit of the future" as 
China-Japan relations continue to develop on a positive 
track, so that the two countries can enjoy "friendship from 
generation to generation." 
 
Greece-Macedonia Talks 
---------------------- 
 
¶6. China hopes Greece and Macedonia can handle their name 
dispute through consultations in a way that is conducive to 
long-term peace in the Balkan region, said Qin in response to 
a Xinhua Agency reporter's question.  China accepts any 
agreement reached by Greece and Macedonia. 
 
Chinese Students Brawl in Canada?

--------------------------------- 
 
¶7. The spokesman has not heard reports of fighting between 
Chinese and Canadian students in Canada referred to by a 
Phoenix TV reporter.  Qin stated that China always requires 
Chinese abroad to abide by local laws and customs and 
likewise requires other countries to guarantee the lawful 
rights and interests of Chinese citizens. 
 
Visits: Middle East Envoy, Micronesia, Senegal 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶8. Special Envoy to the Middle East Sun Bigan will attend a 
December 17 international donors' conference in Paris aimed 
at raising funds to support the Palestinian Authority, before 
visiting Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and Syria.  President 
Mori of Micronesia will visit China December 16-22 as will 
Senegal State Minister of Foreign Affairs Gadio December 
18-22.
