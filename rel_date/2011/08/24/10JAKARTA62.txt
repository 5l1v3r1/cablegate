¶1. This is an action request.  Please see paragraphs 2 and 11. 
 
¶2. Embassy Jakarta proposes a food security conference in Jakarta in 
late March 2010 that would focus on the productivity and regulatory 
aspects of biotech crops.  Post requests EEB ag-biotech funds 
offered in Ref (A) for this event.  Food security is a key goal of 
the U.S.-Indonesian bilateral Comprehensive Partnership. A new 
Indonesian focus on food productivity has opened the door for 
regulatory change in favor of market access for biotech products and 
foreign agribusiness.  Although U.S. and Indonesian definitions of 
food security differ - Indonesia stresses increased domestic food 
production - Indonesia's food security goals can be better achieved 
through the use of biotech crops.  The conference would also offer 
increased opportunities for U.S. firms to promote their products to 
the Indonesian private sector and government officials. 
 
Structure of the Conference 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3. The food security conference would run for 1 1/2 days and 
incorporate three themes:  1) investment in food production, 
including biotech crops and foreign agribusiness participation in 
domestic food production; 2) improvement and investment in 
post-harvest food distribution infrastructure; and 3) capacity 
building for agricultural and food production sciences.  We note 
that the proposed time for the conference might coincide with a 
visit by EEB A/S Jose Fernandez to Indonesia.  If so, we could 
ensure that A/S Fernandez would have a prominent role. 
 
Focus on Biotech Issues 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. Because of the renewed focus on food security, Indonesian 
officials are giving greater attention to technology and investment 
issues which have the potential to increase agricultural 
productivity.  Officials are now considering biotech crops as a part 
of this process, and U.S. agribusinesses and crops technology could 
help advance these objectives. 
 
¶5. The conference would also encourage investment by U.S. 
agribusinesses.  Among the problems that the private sector could 
address are insufficient infrastructure to distribute fresh foods, 
including ports, roads, and cold storage chains; regulatory 
constraints; and investment restrictions. 
 
Advancing Policy Objectives 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6. This conference will contribute to the development of 
implementing regulations for the 2005 Biotech law.  Indonesia has a 
Presidential Decree issued in 1999 covering biotech issues, but a 
subsequent law passed in 2005 still has no implementing regulations. 
 The lack of clarity on biosafety and food safety authorization for 
biotech crops and food has so far prevented the approval of any 
biotech production in Indonesia.  A food security conference could 
focus key issues and highlight biotech benefits for regulatory 
officials as they develop their biotech regulations. 
 
¶7. Policymakers, academics, and domestic industry will receive a 
greater understanding of the benefits of using biotech crops for 
productivity and output.  Indonesian food productivity has not seen 
significant gains in decades.  Biotech crops offer the capacity for 
Indonesian domestic food production to once again increase its 
productivity. 
 
¶8. The conference will also contribute to a greater awareness of the 
benefits of U.S. agribusiness participation in the country. 
Indonesia has traditionally shunned foreign agricultural investment 
and preferred local agribusiness.  New officials, including the 
Deputy Agriculture Minister, have called for greater foreign 
investment in food production in Indonesia to increase production. 
 
Target Audience 
--------------- 
 
¶9. There is a wide range of potential officials that the conference 
will target, including: 
 
 
JAKARTA 00000062  002 OF 002 
 
 
-- Agricultural officials dealing with the approval of new crops, 
especially biotech crops; 
-- Agricultural officials concerned with food production in the 
country, and local production in the areas that have the greatest 
amount of food insecurity; 
-- Officials involved in Indonesia's food security policies; 
-- Indonesian agribusinesses, who are the best potential allies for 
adopting biotech seeds for increased production and greater 
efficiency; 
-- Indonesian officials dealing with transportation and trade 
infrastructure 
-- Indonesian food processing industries 
-- Indonesian legislators 
-- Indonesian agricultural academics 
 
 
Follow-Up Activities 
-------------------- 
 
¶10. FAS-Jakarta will collaborate with local stakeholders as well as 
FAS-Washington in developing follow up activities to possibly 
include farmer-to-farmer programs and short-term training on plant 
breeding/biotechnology for university faculty and/or government 
decision-makers.   A possible source of funding for this would be 
the USDA Emerging Market Program.
