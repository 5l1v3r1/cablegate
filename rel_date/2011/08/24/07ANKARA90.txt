Enforcement Deputy Director General Mehmet Guzel to discuss 
recent Turkish Customs activities.  Guzel provided overview 
of new proposal to establish a Turkish Customs officer 
academy to standardize the training provided to new officers 
and as a way to provide formal refresher training to other 
officers.  This proposal was developed following the recent 
indoctrination visit by Turkish Customs officials to the U.S. 
 EXBS Advisor informed Guzel that the U.S. proposal for new 
portal monitor equipment instead of just parts has been 
submitted to MFA and is being reviewed.

and Disarmament First Secretary Serhan Yigit to conduct 
monthly update meeting on all current projects in progress in 
Turkey, including Internal Control Program (ICP), Commodity 
Identification Training (CIT), Product Identification Tool 
(PIT) and Second Line of Defense (SLD).  EXBS advisor 
reviewed the meetings which have been held with various 
parliamentarians and advisors to promote the NP Cooperation 
Agreement.  EXBS Advisor also proposed that consideration be 
given to utilization of individual grants, until the NP 
Cooperation Agreement has final ratification, for the current 
equipment which is ready for delivery to Turkey.  EXBS 
Advisor explained that this process is utilized in other 
countries prior to blanket Agreements and would allow Turkish 
Customs-requested equipment to get into the field.  Yigit 
stated that this process could be considered, however 
additional information is needed for consideration.  He also 
raised concern that the Turkish Parliament may voice 
disapproval of this approach.  Yigit informed EXBS Advisor

joint meeting early in January to plan for future of ICP
