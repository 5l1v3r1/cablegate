¶1.  Per ref C, Econoff delivered reftel demarches on the 
upcoming CITES COP 14 to the Department of the Washington 
Conference in the Ministry of Environment.  A written 
response was received on May 18 from Krzysztof Lissowski, 
Deputy Director of the Department of Forestry, Nature 
Conservation and Landscape Protection in the Ministry of 
Environment.  Text of the response follows. 
 
¶2.  BEGIN TEXT OF RESPONSE 
 
Since Poland joined the European Union in 2004, the 
evaluation of CoP proposals and establishing final position 
is made in cooperation with other EU member states and our 
final attitude towards certain proposals is dependant on the 
EU position. 
 
As far as certain US proposals are concerned, CITES 
Management Authority of Poland fully supports the idea of 
inclusion of all species of the sawfish (Pristide spp.) in 
Appendix I and inclusion of Pterapogon kauderni in App. II of 
CITES.  As for the proposal regarding Corallium spp., we 
believe it is worth consideration, but for now our position 
in this respect is open.  Referring to exclusion of bobcat 
(Lynx rufus) from App. II, we are not in favor of this 
proposal. 
 
Moreover, we give our support to both proposals on Lamna 
nasus and Squalas acanthias submitted by Germany on behalf of 
the European Community. 
 
Documents concerning Addis Ababa Principles and Guidelines 
for the Sustainable Use of Biodiversity and Management of 
annual export quotas are worth supporting and we are in favor 
of them.  As for documents on Asian Big Cats, our position 
for now is open.
