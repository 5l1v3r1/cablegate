(SBU) Responding to a question during his joint press 
conference August 19 with visiting Jordanian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Nasser Judeh, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet 
Davatoglu said recent USG initiatives are creating an 
opportunity for peace in the Middle East.  Asserting the 
importance of the next four-to-five months to the revival of 
peace hopes, Davutoglu urged Israel to demonstrate its will 
for peace by restraining settlement activity and refraining 
from actions that infringe upon the status of East Jerusalem. 
 Davuotolgu balanced these remarks with a plea for 
Palestinian unity.  He urged contending Palestinian factions 
to abandon their tactical maneuvering and unite to facilitate 
a breakthrough in peace efforts.  He warned Palestinians that 
their continuing failure to reconcile risked harm to the 
entire region.
