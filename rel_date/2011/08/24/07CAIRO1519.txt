¶1. AFRICAN AFFAIRS SAMIR HOSNI GAVE POLOFF A READOUT ON HIS MAY 
8 - 11 TRIP TO THE COMOROS, ONE OF THE LEAGUE'S 22 MEMBER 
STATES, TO MEDIATE THE CONFLICT THERE.  HOSNI SAID THAT HE 
AND AFRICAN UNION ENVOY MANDELA NEGOTIATED THE AGREEMENT 
UNDER WHICH ISLAND PRESIDENT BACAR STEPPED DOWN FROM OFFICE 
AND APPOINTED THE MINISTER OF ECONOMY AS INTERIM PRESIDENT, 
UNTIL NEW ELECTIONS ARE HELD IN JUNE.  ONE OF BACAR'S KEY 
CONCERNS, SAID HOSNI, WAS HIS OWN SECURITY; IT WAS AGREED

SECURITY.  ACCORDING TO HOSNI, THE LEAGUE HAD AGREED TO GIVE 
$350,000, VIA THE UNDP, TO FINANCE THE JUNE ELECTIONS.
