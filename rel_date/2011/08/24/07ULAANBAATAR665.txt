¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel demarche delivered by Post, the 
Mongolian Foreign Ministry informed us on November 29 that Mongolia 
will likely absent itself from votes on two upcoming anti-Israel 
UNGA resolutions and abstain on a third.  G.Batjargal, Counselor of 
the MFA's Multilateral Cooperation Department, told us that Mongolia 
intends to not be present for votes on two resolutions: the 
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the 
Palestinian People, and the Division for Palestinian Rights within 
the UN Secretariat.  Batjargal said Mongolia will likely abstain on 
a related resolution: the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 
Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and 
Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories.  (Note: In 2006, Mongolia 
abstained or was absent for votes on these three resolutions.  End 
Note.) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mongolian President N.Enkhbayar is currently touring the 
Middle East, with state visits to the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait 
and Qatar.  He is expected to return to Mongolia on December 1.
