FOREIGN LIAISON DIRECTORATE 
RUSSIAN FEDERATION MINISTRY OF DEFENSE 
Moscow, Russia 
 
Dated 16 September 2008 
Note # 3672 
 
Response to Note 570 dated the 27th of August 2008 
 
The Foreign Liaison Directorate of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Defense presents its compliments to the Defense 
Attache Office of the United States Embassy to the Russian 
Federation and has the honor to report that the Russian 
peacekeeping forces' rules of engagement, in their areas of 
operation (security zones) on the territory of Georgia, 
Abkhazia, and South Ossetia, are governed by current standard 
international legal basis for the reconciliation of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian and Georgian-Ossetian armed conflicts. 
The layout and size of the aforementioned zones were 
determined in strict accordance with agreements between the 
conflicting parties, and thus far have not changed. 
 
Entry into Russian peacekeeping forces' areas of operation to 
deliver humanitarian aid is granted at the zone commander's 
discretion based on requests, which must be submitted no 
later than 24 hours before the intended trip.  The request 
will contain:  the goal of the trip, the route, the number of 
vehicles and their plate numbers, the number of people and 
their information, the type and amount of cargo, and the 
number and serial numbers of the escort's weapons. 
 
Russian peacekeeping troops have the right to use armed force 
in the following instances: 
 
-for the purpose of ensuring their security and safety 
against any threat to their life and well-being, service 
members retain the irrevocable right to self defense. 
 
-in the event of an attempt to forcefully prevent them from 
carrying out their assigned tasks. 
 
-to repel overt armed assaults. 
 
-to protect the civilians against violent threats to their 
lives or well-being. 
 
The Foreign Liaison Directorate of the Russian Ministry of 
Defense avails itself of the opportunity to renew to the 
Defense Attache Office assurances of its highest 
consideration.
