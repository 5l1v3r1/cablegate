¶1. (U) THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS AN ACTION REQUEST FOR G/TIP. 
PLEASE SEE PARA 3. 
 
¶2. (U) On June 4, Global Affairs Officer and Embassy Legal 
Advisor delivered ref A points informing regarding the TIP 
Report's release and Germany's tier ranking to key officials 
in the German MFA, Family Ministry, Interior Ministry, Labor 
Ministry, and Justice Ministry.  Post also shared the text of 
Germany's country narrative, including a German translation. 
Post is scheduled to follow up with these ministries in a 
July 1 interagency roundtable meeting to be hosted by the 
MFA.  A German translation of the country narrative has been 
posted on the Embassy's website at 
http://amerikadienst.usembassy.de, along with links to the 
entire TIP Report on the Department's website. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  In advance of the July 1 meeting 
with German officials, post requests G/TIP guidance to 
respond to previous German thoughts on potential ways to 
strengthen bilateral cooperation in the international fight 
against TIP (ref B).  Specifically, in a February 25 meeting 
to review G/TIP's Action Plan for Germany, German officials 
noted the success of a 2006 DOJ visit focused on the U.S. 
T-Visa and suggested that a further exchange of best 
practices on victim identification techniques and efforts to 
fight labor trafficking would be useful for both countries. 
German officials have also expressed interest in improved 
information sharing between German and U.S. law enforcement 
on the structure and practices of criminal organizations 
engaged in trafficking.  Finally, both the MFA and Justice 
Ministry reiterated interest in receiving information about 
U.S. efforts to educate and sensitize judges on TIP (ref C).
