QUIET; NEW ISRAELI INCURSION RILES PASF CHIEFS AND FAYYAD 
 
REF: A. JERUSALEM 2330

¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  National Security Forces (NSF) contacts 
report Nablus is generally quiet as of 1500 local November 8, 
and the NSF continues to operate checkpoints and mobile 
patrols throughout the city.  A workman accidentally 
triggered a boobytrap in Nablus' old city (Qasbah) at 1230, 
killing himself and injuring two.  PA police and intelligence 
units detained 10 suspects (including Hamas members) for 
questioning in the past 24 hours.  The IDF entered central 
and western Nablus early November 8, arresting 7 Palestinians 
and searching two mosques.  Nablus Governor Jamal Muhaysin 
and PA security forces (PASF) commanders protested the IDF 
raids as counterproductive and harmful to the PASF 
operation's success.  PM Fayyad expressed similar views 
privately in a conversation with the Consul General.  Fayyad 
also visited Nablus in the afternoon.  The IDF has not 
returned protective vests it confiscated on November 3.  End 
summary. 
 
City Generally Quiet; PASF Detain 
10 Suspects, Operate Checkpoints/Patrols 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) As of 1500 local on November 8, Nablus is generally 
quiet, with NSF-led forces continuing to operate fixed 
positions around the city and conduct vehicle and foot 
patrols.  NSF commanders report that PA police and 
intelligence units are questioning 10 suspected criminal 
gang, militia and terror cell members, and that any wanted 
suspects in Balata Camp who have not surrendered by late 
November 8 will be arrested immediately.  Hamas press 
statements allege that PASF arrested four of their members in 
the past 24 hours.  Security officials report that Fatah 
leaders and Nablus Governor Muhaysin are helping to persuade 
the remaining wanted persons to surrender. 
 
Boobytrap Death/Injuries in Qasbah 
Price-Hike Protests in al-Askar, 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Palestinian press and local contacts report that 
Palestinian laborer Rami Issa (age 40) was killed and two 
others were injured when Issa accidentally triggered a 
explosive boobytrap in a house in al-Qasbah.  NSF contacts 
say they suspect militants rigged the device some weeks ago 
to target IDF troops conducting a raid.  Security contacts 
report that over 100 residents of al-Askar refugee camp 
staged a protest the morning of November 8, but the protest 
was peaceful, and concerned rising costs of food/household 
goods, not security matters. 
 
New Israeli Incursion in Central/West 
Nablus, 7 Arrested; No Progress on Vests 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to security contacts and Palestinian 
press, the IDF entered Nablus' central Makhfah and western 
Rafidiya neighborhoods from 0130-0400 on November 8, 
arresting 7 Palestinians and searching two mosques and 
several houses.  Palestinian press quote Governor Muhaysin as 
criticizing the IDF raids for "creating the impression that 
the PASF and IDF are running the same operation and just 
doing a shift change at night," and saying that IDF 
incursions play into the hands of terror groups' propaganda 
which claims PASF are doing the IDF's work for them.  NSF 
commanders said they are angry that the IDF are entering the 
same neighborhoods the PASF is operating in and the IDF raids 
greatly complicate their efforts to establish the PASF as the 
security authority in residents' minds. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The IDF has not returned 80-90 protective vests 
confiscated from the Presidential Guard on November 3 (Ref 
B), according to PA contacts and USSC officers.  Security 
contacts say protective vests were critical in reducing 
casualties in previous operations and are necessary to 
prevail against gang/militia gunmen who are better armed than 
the NSF. 
 
 
Fayyad in Nablus 
---------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) PM Fayyad traveled to Nablus on the afternoon of 
November 8 to urge PASF commanders and troops to stay focused 
on their mission.  He told the Consul General afterwards that 
he was impressed by their determination, but worried that 
 
JERUSALEM 00002336  002 OF 002 
 
 
they would lose their focus if the IDF continues to operate 
in Nablus every night.  Fayyad said he walked the streets of 
the Qasbah, and the situation was calm despite the heavy 
security presence.
