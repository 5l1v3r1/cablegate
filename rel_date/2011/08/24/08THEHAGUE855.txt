SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Dutch will push human rights during the 
October 13-14 GAERC discussions on Uzbekistan, Belarus, and 
Zimbabwe, and a deliberate approach to reviewing Moldova's 
relations with the EU.  The Dutch are blocking consensus on 
Uzbekistan.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Poloff shared reftel A points with key MFA contacts. 
 Regarding Uzbekistan, Deputy EU Correspondent Rochus Pronk 
briefed allied, non-EU diplomats on October 8 concerning the 
Dutch position.  The EU presidency reportedly had hoped for 
consensus to lift sanctions.  However, the Dutch are the only 
country to disagree.  FM Verhagen wants a discussion of the 
situation in Uzbekistan, which has not lived up to the April 
benchmarks on releasing human rights defenders, supporting 
press freedom, and lifting NGO restrictions.  The Dutch want 
to at least maintain the EU weapons embargo.  The Dutch 
expect to "reluctantly agree" to ending visa restrictions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Regarding Belarus, Pronk said FM Verhagen "sees no 
reason for a substantial change in policy."  Others agree 
with the Dutch position, but the proposal by some in the EU 
to lift visa restrictions and invite the FM to Brussels "is 
going too fast."  The Dutch are "open to discussing small 
steps," but want to see the West engage wth opposition 
parties in Belarus. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In Zimbabwe, the Dutch are disappointed with the 
lack of progress.  Pronk said the EU had almost agreed on 
conclusions for the GAERC, and that aid to Zimbabwe should be 
addressed once the coalition agreement is implemented.  The 
Dutch believe the UN should be "more in the foreground" in 
resolving the current situation. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Regarding Moldova, the EU has agreed to a set of 
conclusions for the GAERC, and there will be no offer of EU 
membership.  Some members want to speed up negotiations, but 
the Dutch see a "long road ahead" for Moldova to make 
progress on reforms.
