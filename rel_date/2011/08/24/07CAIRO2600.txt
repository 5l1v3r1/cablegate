(U) On August 20, Egypt's Supreme State Security Court 
sentenced nine Egyptians for their alleged role in the April 
7, 2005 suicide bombing in Cairo's Khan Al Khalili tourist 
bazaar, in which one American citizen and two French 
nationals were killed, and several others wounded, including 
three Americans (reftels).  The court sentenced four of the 
defendants to life in prison, and jailed five for periods of 
between 1-10 years.  Four other defendants were acquitted and 
released.  The court delayed sentencing another (who recently 
underwent heart surgery, and is still in the hospital) until 
November 20.  The defendants were charged with belonging to 
an illegal group, using force and violence to disturb public 
order and threaten the security of the state, and the 
possession of weapons intended for use in terrorist 
operations.
