Main Stories: 
------------- 
The three dailies highlight Special Envoy Mitchell calling for the 
international community's engagement to support the resumption of 
negotiations as soon as possible with a clear timeframe to achieve 
positive outcomes. Al-Quds independent daily leads with news on 
Mitchell stressing that cooperation between the US and Europe is 
crucial to push the peace process forward. The daily also runs a 
headline of Mitchell stating that the Palestinians don't have a 
state and they deserve to have one of their own. 
 
In related news, the dailies report that US National Security 
Advisor Jim Jones will visit the Middle East in an attempt to push 
the peace process forward. 
 
The local press reports that one Palestinian was killed and three 
were injured during Israeli shelling in northern Gaza yesterday. 
Defense Minister Ehud Barak urged Hamas to stop firing rockets at 
Israel in order to avoid a strong Israeli response. 
 
Palestinian media highlights news that the PLO Executive Committee 
called for the discussion of how to save Jerusalem from continued 
Israeli demolitions and construction at the next Arab Summit, 
scheduled for March in Libya. The committee issued a statement 
yesterday urging the international community and the Quartet to take 
a decisive position regarding the Israeli actions in Jerusalem and 
present the issue to the UNSC. 
 
In related news, the dailies front page reports that the Fatah 
Central Committee concluded a meeting yesterday headed by President 
Mahmoud Abbas. The Central Committee renewed calls for a complete 
settlement freeze to pave the way for the resumption of 
negotiations. The Central Committee also rejected any temporary 
solutions to the conflict and a state with temporary borders. 
 
In its weekly cabinet meeting yesterday, the Council of Ministers 
condemned the Israeli attacks against the Palestinian citizens of 
Tana (near Nablus) on Sunday. Prime Minister Fayyad asked several 
ministries to pursue the reconstruction of Tana.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------Tayseer Zubri, writing in Al-Quds under the title 
tle 
"The New US Move ... Would it Help Obama's Administration?" is 
skeptical that US efforts to resume peace talks between the 
Palestinians and Israelis will succeed. Zubri believes that the US 
should stop playing the mediator role because it failed and 
recommends that the UN takes over.
