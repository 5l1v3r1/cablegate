SUBJECT: SOUTH AFRICA LAUNCHES SUNSET REVIEW OF ANTI- 
DUMPING DUTIES ON FROZEN CHICKEN PIECES IMPORTED FROM THE 
UNITED STATES. 
 
REF: (A) PRETORIA 2082 (B) STATE 98082 
 
¶1. (U) On September 16 2005, the International Trade 
Administration Commission (ITAC) of South Africa 
initiated in Notice No. 1737 of government Gazette No. 
28011 of 2005 a sunset review of anti-dumping duties on 
frozen meat of fowls of the species Gallus Domesticus cut 
in pieces with bone-in originating in or imported from 
the United States.   The review is based on prima facie 
information submitted by South African Customs Union 
(SACU) industry indicating that expiry of duty on 
December 27 2005 would likely lead to continuation or 
recurrence of dumping and material injury. 
 
¶2. (U) ITAC is currently in the process of contacting all 
known manufacturers and exporters of the product to SACU 
in order for them to be given an opportunity to assist in 
the investigation.  All United States' manufacturers and 
exporters of the subject product should complete the 
foreign manufacturers/exporter questionnaire.  All 
adjustments required by manufacturers and exporters 
should be disclosed in the questionnaire together with 
calculations and supporting documents. The Agricultural 
Counselor will be sending the ITAC questionnaire to the 
United States Department of Agriculture and the Poultry 
and Egg Export Council, to ensure that the United States 
poultry companies respond promptly. 
 
¶3. (U) All responses and information regarding this 
matter and arguments concerning the allegations of 
continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury 
must be submitted in writing to reach the Director for 
Trade Remedies at ITAC no later than 3 p.m. on October 
27, 2005.  Further information may be obtained from the 
following persons at ITAC: Ms. K. Modimokwane at (27) 
(12) 394-3637 or Ms. M. Wagner at (27) (12) 394-3593.
