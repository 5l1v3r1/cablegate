SUBJECT: BAHRAIN CABINET APPROVES AMCHAM BAHRAIN 
 
On May 23 the cabinet, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Islamic Affairs Sheikh Abdulla bin Khalid Al 
Khalifa, approved a proposal by Minister of Commerce Ali 
Saleh al Saleh to establish an American Chamber of Commerce 
in Bahrain.  Ambassador congratulated the Minister May 24, 
adding that it was a real victory having the AmCham under the 
purvue of the Ministry of Commerce rather than the Ministry 
of Labor and Social Affairs.  EmbOffs have discussed next 
steps with the founding committee, who are planning a 
membership drive in advance of board membership selection.
