DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 151024 
 
(SBU)  We carried our reftel demarche on November 2 with MFA 
IO action officer Emmanuel Pineda, who expressed appreciation 
for U.S. views on the Community of Democracies meeting in 
Bamako November 14-17, particularly concerning the 
composition of the U.S. delegation.  He said that the French 
delegation had not yet been determined but that he would 
inform us when able to do so.  He said that he would also 
respond to our demarche once he and his colleagues have had a 
chance to study it further.  As on previous occasions, Pineda 
was not optimistic that France would be able to offer 
monetary support to the conference or to Mali as host of the 
conference.
