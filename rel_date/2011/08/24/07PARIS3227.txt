SUBJECT: DARFUR:  FRENCH READY TO ADOPT UNSC RESOLUTION ON 
HYBRID AU-UN OPERATION 
 
REF: STATE 104844 
 
(SBU)  MFA Sudan Desk Officer Frederic Bouvier said on July 
31 that France was prepared to vote for adoption of the "in 
blue" text of a UN Security Council Resolution on the hybrid 
AU-UN operation in Darfur, a text renegotiated on July 30 in 
New York.  He reported that a final text apparently developed 
on July 28 was, at U.S. request, reconsidered on July 30, on 
the basis of U.S. concerns about the timing of the transition 
of the force from an AU operation to a UN operation.  This 
involved re-negotiation of OP 5, which the U.S., UK, and 
French delegations succeeded in doing on July 30.  Bouvier 
said that the French side did not anticipate a further need 
to re-examine the text and was ready to vote for the adoption 
of the text that had "gone blue" the evening of July 30 in 
New York.
