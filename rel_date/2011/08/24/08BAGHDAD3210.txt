¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Key independent media editors in the Kurdistan 
Region have cautiously welcomed passage September 22 of a new KRG 
Press Law, with one veteran editor characterizing it as "80 percent 
good."  Our interlocutors were pleased with revisions in the law 
that cap defamation fines, prohibit the closure of media outlets, 
and provide some clarity to previously vague language banning 
disclosure of national security information.  The editors we spoke 
with were still worried that they could face the KRG's wrath for 
publishing stories on, for example, home-grown terrorist threats 
such as Ansar al-Islam, and complained that media outlets could 
still be suspended.  All of our contacts were distressed by the tone 
of a recent meeting between KRG President Masoud Barzani and key 
Kurdish media leaders in which Barzani said the press could 
criticize the KRG -- but only with approval from "the proper 
authorities."  End summary. 
 
Independent Media Editors on KRG Press Law 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Over the past week, RRT Erbil has polled editors at the 
Kurdistan Region's handful of independent media outlets for their 
reactions to the Kurdistan National Assembly's (KNA) September 22 
passage of a new Press Law.  Our interlocutors included Lvin 
Magazine Chief Editor Ahmad Mira, Rozhnama Chief Editor Adnan Osman, 
Hawlati Chief Editor Abid Arif, Hawlati Publisher Tareq Hasan, and 
Awene Chief Editor Shwan Mohammed. 
 
The Verdict:  "80 Percent Good"... 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Our contacts all agreed that the version passed by the KNA 
was an improvement over the previous bill, which was vetoed by 
President Barzani following public criticism.  Echoing the views of 
his colleagues, Lvin's Ahmad Mira characterized the new law as "80 
percent good."  In particular, the editors noted that the revised 
version reduced the amount of money that journalists and media 
outlets can be fined for defamation.  (The maximum fine for 
journalists is now set at 5 million dinar, or approximately $4100, 
and the maximum fine for media outlets is 10 million dinar, or 
approximately $8200.)  It also prohibits the closure of media 
outlets and provides some clarity on what constitutes "national 
security information" that cannot be published or broadcast. 
 
...But That Other 20 Percent Still Worrisome 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Lvin's Mira said the national security information 
provision of the new law remained "too vague."  For example, he said 
he would have to think carefully about publishing anything about 
Ansar al-Islam.  "I'm afraid that if we write about Ansar, we're 
going to get sued," he explained.  Hawlati's Abid Arif and Tareq 
Hasan -- who has done jail time in retaliation for Hawlati's 
muckraking 
-- complained that the new law allows for the temporary suspension 
of media outlets.  Such a suspension "would kill us," they asserted. 
 
 
The Other Shoe 
-------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) All of our interlocutors were distressed by the tone of a 
September 28 meeting that KRG President Barzani held with key 
Kurdistan Region media leaders.  Noting that he had not yet actually 
signed the new Press Law, Barzani warned that while the press is 
part of the democratic process, reporters should "concern themselves 
with subjects they know about;" the press is free to criticize the 
KRG, but such criticism must be cleared with the proper authorities, 
he said.  Barzani also chastised the media for creating what he 
called a "culture of losing self-confidence" and delivered a 
pep-talk about the proper role of the Kurdish-language press in 
helping defeat "enemy plans" to destroy the Kurdistan Region's 
achievements. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) From what we've heard, passage of the new Press Law and 
the positive revisions were due to personal lobbying by KNA Speaker 
Adnan Mufti, Deputy Speaker Kamal Kirkuki, and KRG Culture Minister 
Falakadeen Kakayee, who was present for the vote despite serious 
health issues that have hobbled him for most of the year.  The three 
share a relatively progressive view about the role of the 
 
BAGHDAD 00003210  002 OF 002 
 
 
independent media in the Kurdistan Region.  Rozhnama's Adnan Osman 
singled out Mufti and Kakayee in particular, writing in an editorial 
that "no one should forget their role in this success."  Deputy 
Speaker Kirkuki privately emphasized to us that, while not perfect, 
the new law is an "improvement" designed to "tackle the legal 
impediments" to the development of a genuinely free press in the 
Kurdistan Region.  This positive movement on an important KRG 
governance issue comes in the wake of efforts by RRT and Embassy 
Baghdad, and Ambassador Krajeski in particular, to press senior 
Kurdish officials to respect press freedoms.
