SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050143937 
 
REF: 07 TEL AVIV 225 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050143937 for the export of 
pistols to Israel. Post is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for Request: Previous Blue Lantern 
demonstrated significant concern with the record keeping and 
control of defense articles demonstrated by end-user, Mitvach 
Ha'ir Ltd (REFTEL). The previous check also found inaccurate 
end-use information submitted on the license, as Mitvach 
Ha'ir was not/not listed as the end-user despite being the 
recipient of the defense articles in question. This request 
is for Post to establish the bona fides of this transaction 
and the entities involved. 
 
¶4. (U) Action Request: Post is requested to establish the 
bona fides of this transaction and end-user by making 
appropriate inquiries to authorities of the Government of 
Israel and representatives of Mitvach Ha'ir. In its reply, 
Post is requested to comment on the security of Mitvach Ha'ir 
facilities and any other information pertinent to these 
transactions such as end-use and concerns about the entities 
involved.
