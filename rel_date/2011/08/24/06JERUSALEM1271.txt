REF: JERUSALEM 1231 AND PREVIOUS 
 
PA completes culling in Rafah 
------------------------------ 
 
¶1.  (SBU) PA Agriculture Ministry Gaza Director of Control 
and Quarantine Said Siyam said the PA had culled 13,000 
chickens in Rafah March 27 and asserted that they would start 
culling chickens in farms located in Jahr el-Deik and Tel 
el-Hawa March 28.  Siyam said the lab test results  for Tel 
el-Hawa (1 km south of Gaza City) had returned positive for 
AI and that the area had been placed under quarantine March 
¶23.  WHO Representative Mahmud Daher reported that poisoned 
drinking water had been administered to 23,000 egg-layers in 
Tel el-Hawa March 27, with culling to begin March 28. 
 
Serious security concerns prevent 
culling operations from continuing 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Outgoing PA Agriculture Minister Walid Abed Rabo 
reported to EconOff on the serious difficulties that had 
surrounded the culling of the Rafah flocks  He described how 
Rafah farmers had shot at MOA staff and kidnapped one MOA 
official for two hours, and how those Rafah farmers had also 
refused to bury the culled poultry carcasses until they 
received compensation.  He said an agreement was finally 
reached and the farmers finished burying the poultry March 
¶28. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Given the Agriculture Ministry's experience in 
Rafah, Abed Rabo said he now wanted a police escort for his 
staff to enter the affected properties in Jahr el-Deik and 
Tel el-Hawa to cull the flocks.  However, he said that the PA 
Ministry of Interior had not yet responded to his calls for 
assistance. 
 
USG-purchased PPE kits arrive in Gaza 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) 1500 personal protective equipment (PPE) kits 
arrived at Ben Gurion Airport March 27 and were being 
delivered to Gaza (1300 kits) and the West Bank (200 kits) by 
USAID's NGO partner CARE.  At 15:30 local time, March 28, 
USAID staff confirmed that the 1300 PPE kits (in 52 boxes) 
were handed over PA staff at the Erez crossing March 28.
