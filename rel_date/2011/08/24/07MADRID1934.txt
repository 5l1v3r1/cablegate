¶1. (U)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche and background 
materials separately on October 2, to Fernando 
Fernandez-Arias, Spanish Deputy Director General for Human 
Rights, and Jose Luis Garcia Galan, Deputy Director General 
for Southeast Asia, and thanked them for the several 
statements already issued by Spain and the EU on the matter. 
Fernandez-Arias replied that he was in the process of sending 
instructions to Geneva for a Spanish intervention at the 
UNHRC that would be fairly severe on Burma.  Additionally, he 
was waiting for greater details on a possible trip to Rangoon 
by Spain's Special Ambassador for Human Rights Silvia 
Escobar, accompanying an EU delegation. He agreed that 
continued pressure is necessary. 
 
¶2. (U)  Garcia-Galan agreed with Poloff and said that the 
U.S. has been crystal clear in its position on Burma during 
these recent developments.  He appreciated U.S. recognition 
of Spain's statements of condemnation, and he added that 
Spain would remain committed to the EU position which would 
be elaborated fully at the October 15 GAERC.  He also told 
poloff that Ambassador Escobar had sought a Burmese entry 
visa and been denied in Geneva. 
 
¶3. (U)  Fernandez-Arias called Poloff October 3 to follow up 
that Escobar had not gained a visa and the mission would be 
delayed.  He expected that the issue would be discussed in 
Brussels at the upcoming EU COPS and GAERC meetings, where 
decisions would be made on whether to send an EU delegation. 
 
¶4. (U)  The Spanish foreign ministry issued a communique on 
September 26 warning against any violent repression of the 
peaceful demonstrations.  The declaration also expressed 
solidarity with the Burmese people and full support for all 
international efforts for a peaceful solution.  On October 2, 
Jose Blanco, Party Secretary of the ruling Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party also issued a public condemnation calling for 
an end to repression and steps toward democratization of 
Burma.  At a joint press conference with Russian President 
Putin September 28, President Zapatero expressed his support 
for the arrival of democracy in Burma.
