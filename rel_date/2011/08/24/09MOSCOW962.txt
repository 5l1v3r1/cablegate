SUBJECT: MONTREAL CONVENTION DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF:  STATE 27782 
 
¶1. (SBU) We shared reftel information regarding the ratification of 
the Montreal Convention of 1999 with diplomats in the MFA's 
Department of North America Affairs and with civil aviation 
officials at the Ministry of Transportation (MOT). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Elena Mikheeva, Deputy Head of the Air Services Division in 
the MOT's Department of State Policy in Civil Aviation, accepted the 
information.  However, she said she could not offer any substantive 
response.  The issue would need to be discussed with senior MOT 
officials.  Separately, Oleg Demidov, Deputy Director of the MOT's 
Department of State Policy in Civil Aviation, told us that 
ratification of the Montreal Convention was a sensitive issue, but 
said he also was not authorized to elaborate on Russia's specific 
concerns, noting that the issue could only be discussed at the 
Deputy Minister level or higher. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While Russian officials would not share with us the GOR's 
specific concerns with the Montreal Convention, Russian legal and 
aviation experts have noted that the convention's liability 
provisions for passenger injuries and fatalities, and compensation 
for delayed passengers, are far more generous than current Russian 
law.  Hence, scholars have noted that ratification of the convention 
would require significant changes to Russian aviation and insurance 
law, and would likely increase insurance costs for Russian airlines 
at a time when many are struggling to survive the global economic 
crisis. 
 
¶4. (SBU) We will continue to seek a more senior-level meeting at MOT 
to ascertain the GOR's specific concerns with the Montreal 
Convention.
