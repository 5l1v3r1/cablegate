Prosecutor's Office at the Supreme Court of Appeals objected to 
the verdict that issued a 39-year-and-5-month prison sentence on 
June 2006 for Ali Kaya and Ozcan Ildeniz, two non-commissioned 
officers, who were convicted for their alleged crimes in the 
Semdinli bombing on November 9, 2005 in Hakkari's Semdinli 
district.   The grounds for objection cited by the Prosecutor's 
Office's were procedural inefficiencies, incompetent 
investigation process, and establishment of wrongful grounds

superficially based on thoughts about an alleged and unproven 
criminal network.

considering a general amnesty in any way, blames the government 
for falling behind Mehmet Agar and asks: "Is AKP or DYP in 
power?"  Evrensel daily quotes Tunceli Mayor Songul Erol Abdil

as positive and further proposes that the PKK can lay down arms 
gradually.  Bolge daily reported that Recai Kutan, the leader of 
Happiness Party who is currently visiting Adana, criticized Agar 
for making proposals which are in line with the proposals of the
