SUBJECT: EU Ends Excessive Deficit Procedure 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: On July 8, EU Finance Ministers formally ended a 
four-year old excessive deficit procedure (EDP) regarding Poland. 
This lifts a cloud over some EU subsidies, brings Poland closer to 
Euro adoption, and gives the Polish government more breathing room 
for decisions on aid programs and debt forgiveness, including debt 
owed by Iraq.  In May, the European Commission (EC) recommended 
ending the EDP, after concluding that Poland's general government 
budget deficit had been brought below the EU limit of three percent 
of GDP "in a sustainable and credible manner".  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Article 104 of the European Community Treaty obliges 
EU-member countries to avoid excessive deficits.  The Maastrict 
Treaty limits the general government budget deficit to three percent 
of GDP.  When Poland joined the EU, its general government deficit 
exceeded four percent of GDP.  Consequently, on July 5, 2004 the EC 
initiated the EDP with respect to Poland and five other countries. 
At the time, the Polish government asserted the EC had relied upon 
"invalid" data. 
 
¶3. (U) The Polish government viewed the EDP as unfair punishment for 
introducing structural reforms, such as changes to the pension 
system, and had been pushing to end the EDP for years.  In 2006, 
Poland claimed that its general government deficit had fallen to 2.2 
percent of GDP.  However, the EC concluded then that the improvement 
in the budget situation was a temporary phenomenon, resulting from 
counting open pension fund contributions as part of government 
revenue.  Eurostat, the EU's statistical agency, forced Poland to 
stop using that accounting method in July 2007.  Discontinuing the 
practice pushed the official deficit back above three percent. 
 
¶4. (U) Starting in the second quarter of 2007, high GDP growth led 
to improving Polish public finances, as economic growth translated 
into higher inflows from corporate and value-added taxes.  The EC 
noted that the 2007 deficit was just two percent of GDP.  In fact, 
in the first four months of 2008, Poland recorded a budget surplus, 
although in May the budget slipped back into deficit.  The EC stated 
that the deficit is likely to increase to 2.5% of GDP in 2008, but 
felt the EDP could be ended given a favorable outlook for stability 
in Poland's public finances. 
 
¶5.  (U) The Finance Minister's decision removes a cloud over some 
funding Poland received from the EU, and clears away an obstacle to 
Poland's applying for membership in the European Monetary Union. 
However, many commentators believe provisions of the Polish 
constitution, such as those regarding the central bank, should be 
amended before Poland enters the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), a 
precursor to Euro adoption.  Amending the constitution would require 
support from Euro-skeptics in the opposition PiS party.  The current 
market expectation for Euro adoption is 2012-2013 at the soonest. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  While the end of the EDP is good news for 
Poland, several structural problems still present serious challenges 
to Polish public finances.  Chief among these are early retirement 
and healthcare costs.  Due to the many incentives to retire, only 54 
percent of Poland's potentially active labor force is employed, 
compared to about 70 percent in the EU as a whole.   Meanwhile the 
farming sector is exempt from contributing equally with other Poles 
to social insurance schemes.  The result is proportionately more 
retirees in Poland than in other EU countries and a smaller revenue 
base from which to draw taxes.  As growth slows, addressing these 
issues will become even more pressing.  End comment.
