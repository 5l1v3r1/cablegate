"DANGER" IN JERUSALEM EVICTIONS

Main Stories:

All papers lead with a photo and a report on a "raid" by Israeli 
Jerusalem municipal authorities on residents of Silwan's Bustan 
an 
 
neighborhood in East Jerusalem, during which ultimatums were issued 
that 80 houses, built without Israeli permits, be vacated ahead of 
demolitions to make way for a public park.  Papers note that 1,500 
Palestinians currently live where the park will be built, in an area 
built before 1967 when Israel first "occupied East Jerusalem." 
Ahmad Ruwaydah of the Palestinian Authority (PA)President's office 
called an emergency meeting to discuss the development and called it 
a, "dangerous escalation."  Papers also report that PA spokesperson 
Hatim Abdul Qader called the action illegal and aimed at changing 
the demographic balance in Jerusalem. 
 
Orders to Palestinian residents to vacate 32 houses in Tana village 
near Nablus were issued by Israeli authorities on February 22, 
according to Al Quds' and Al Ayyam's front pages.  Israeli forces 
warned that the Palestinians risk confiscation of their property and 
cattle, as well as fines, should they fail to evacuate the area 
within 70 hours, according to coverage. 
All front pages continue weekend reporting on Palestinian 
reconciliation talks that are expected to begin in Cairo on February 
25, with the exact date still being discussed by Palestinian 
factions.  The report adds that Egypt has sent a paper of "dialogue 
principles" to the factions and awaits their final confirmation to 
attend the talks.  Meanwhile, Al Quds' reports on Palestinian 
Authority (PA)President Abbas' visit to Prague where he reiterated 
calls for a PA national consensus government. 
 
Israel's Premier Olmert is counting on Hamas wanting to finalize 
prisoner exchange and truce agreements with Israel before a new 
Israeli Premier assumes office, according to a DPA report on Al 
Quds' front page.  The report adds that Olmert wants the crowning 
achievement of bringing kidnapped Israeli soldier Shalit home before 
ending his term in office. 
 
Al Ayyam's and Al Quds' front pages run a Reuters report on two Arab 
League needs assessment missions entering Gaza that will also 
investigate war crimes.  Meanwhile, Al Ayyam's and Al Hayat Al 
Jadida's front pages report on a new Gaza reconstruction fund to be 
established by the Gulf Cooperation Council with open membership for 
all Arab countries.  Finally, all papers report that Amnesty 
International has accused Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes 
in Gaza and has called for an arms embargo on the two parties. 
Al Quds' front page reports that Egypt opened the Gaza Rafah 
crossing for a second day on February 22 following its promise to 
keep the crossing open for three days to facilitate the travel of 
students and humanitarian cases. 
Al Quds' runs an inside DPA report about meetings between U.S. 
Senator Lieberman and Israeli party leaders Netanyahu, Livni and 
Lieberman.  Senator Lieberman is quoted saying that the American and 
Israeli positions on Iran are similar.  Israeli Beiteinu's Lieberman 
told his guest that new ideas are needed regarding 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations after their failure to make 
progress for so many years, reporting notes.

headlines in all dailies.  Papers note that the Palestinian 
presidency welcomed the February 21 EU statement that called 
settlement activities a violation of international law and 
inconsistent with commitments made at Annapolis and under the Road 
Map. Papers also noted that PLO chief negotiator Erekat met with 
visiting Senator Lieberman and U.S. Consul General Walles on 
February 21 and informed them that Palestinian will not agree to 
negotiations as long as settlement activities continue. 
 
Senator John Kerry's meeting with Syria's Al Asad was front page 
news in Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida.  The article gives an 
extensive read-out of the Senator's comments on his trip to Syria. 
 
Al Quds continued its inside reporting from February 21 on the 
Kennedy Center's Arabesque festival, detailing at length the 
participation by Palestinian and regional artists. 
 
Saturday, February 21 
Senator Kerry's exclusive interview with Al Quds featured on the 
daily's front page.  The headline highlights Kerry's comments that, 
"Israel must freeze settlement activities and [Israeli development 
of] E1 is rejected by the U.S.- I carry a letter from Hamas and the 
two-state solution is the only viable option."  Kerry stated that he 
visited refugee camps in Gaza and met with Palestinian refugees to 
learn about humanitarian conditions there.  In response to a 
question about whether he carried a letter from Hamas to President 
Obama, Kerry reportedly said, "I have delivered to the appropriate 
diplomatic channels, and that letter will be appropriately handled 
through the diplomatic process." 
 
"Mitchell refuses Netanyahu's economic program and encourages the 
formation of a Palestinian unity government that does not obstruct 
peace," according to Al Ayyam's front page.  The paper reported 
extensively on Mitchell's digital video conference "with Jewish 
groups in the United States."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al Quds editorial is titled, "Silwan... a dangerous 
development!!"(02/23):  "It's clear that this dangerous process is a 
grave violation of international law and conventions... If anyone 
had pinned their hopes on the new U.S. administration... working [to 
revive the peace process], this step [to evict residents from 80 
houses in East Jerusalem], in addition to other Israeli steps in 
Jerusalem, acts to fully block the path of any peace talks and 
proves that Israeli governments... are united in their intent to 
sabotage peace efforts... the question is... what will [the EU] do 
to remove this obstacle?... the same question goes for the new U.S.

h 
foreign policy"(02/23):  "Britain is the party that is first and 
foremost responsible for the Palestinian catastrophe and should be 
first and foremost responsible for putting an end to it.  In the 
21st century, where globalization ...is at the core of international 
politics, there is no longer room for hesitant, cowardly or 
hypocritical policies."
