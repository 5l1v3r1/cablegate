earthquake in Karonga district, Northern Malawi.  The US Government 
Geological Services (USGS) web page indicated a 5.8 magnitude 
earthquake (Richter scale).  Three aftershocks measuring greater

occurred on Monday, December 7, and another of magnitude 5.9 struck 
today at 5:08 am local time.

Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) convened a meeting, chaired by 
Deputy Coordinator-DoDMA Gift Mafuleka (the Director was already in 
the field).  Attending were representatives from Malawi Defence 
Force (MDF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the 
World Food Program (WFP), the Red Cross and USAID.  The key points

Uranium Mine Operational 
------------------------ 
 
¶4. Karonga is the district in Northern Malawi where Paladin Africa 
has recently begun operations at its Kayelekera uranium mine. 
Managing Director Neville Huxham told post that the situation is 
normal at the mine following the quake.  According to Huxham, the 
general manager at the site reported "we felt the bumps;" after 
which all operations were stopped to allow an evaluation of possible 
damage.  Operations were restarted after the inspection uncovered no 
leaks or faults.  The facility was checked again following this 
morning's aftershock, with no evidence of any damages.  There are no 
reports of damage or injuries at the nearby village of Kayelekera. 
The mine is currently running normally.

Karonga area.  The team included participants from WFP, UNICEF, UNDP 
and the Red Cross Society of Malawi.  The field assessment will take 
place on Wednesday December 9.  The delegation will return to 
Lilongwe on Friday December 11 and report.  Each member team will
