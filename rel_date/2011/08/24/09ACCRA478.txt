 Â¶1. (U) Per reftel, PolOff delivered the demarche to Dr. Kojo 
Assan, Director, International Organizations and Multilateral 
Bureau at the Ghana MFA. Assan said that he would raise the 
issue of a public statement calling for an immediate 
ceasefire in Mogadishu with the Deputy Foreign Minister but 
that no statement could be considered because the Foreign 
Minister is out of the country until May 26. PolOff raised 
USG concerns of regional instability and reiterated the need 
for public support of a ceasefire. When PolOff asked about a 
statement after the Foreign Minister's return, Assan remained 
noncommittal simply restating that the Foreign Minister is 
abroad. Post will follow-up after May 26 and advise if 
additional information is available.
