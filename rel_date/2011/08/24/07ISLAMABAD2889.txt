SUBJECT: PAKISTANI RESPONSE TO CAMEL JOCKEY CONFERENCE IN 
UAE, JUNE 26-27 
 
REF: STATE 86406 
 
Â¶1. SUMMARY:  Poloff met with Khizar Hayat Khan, Joint 
Secretary at the Ministry of Interior, a GOP participant at 
 
SIPDIS 
the UAE-hosted Camel Jockey conference in Abu Dhabi, June 
26-27.  Khan is preparing a longer analysis of the GOP's 
expectations from the bilateral MOU for his Minister and 
promised to share it with us later this week.  Currently, 
however, the GOP seems quite satisfied with the proposals and 
framework developed with the UAE regarding 
compensation/rehabilitation of the Pakistani children freed 
from servitude as camel jockeys in the UAE.  Response to 
specific questions detailed in reftel follow.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.a) Does your government expect all former child camel 
jockeys to use the compensation process established by the 
MOU?  Yes, but the GOP foresees a process that involves 
rehabilitation as well as compensation -- something with a 
longer-term impact on the child, the family and even the 
community. 
 
b) If a former child camel jockey does not pursue 
compensation through the MOU claims process, does the MOU 
permit the child or his parents instead to seek compensation 
in your country's courts?  In the courts of the UAE?  In the 
courts of third countries, including the United States?  The 
GOP will allow those who do not wish to pursue compensation 
under the MOU to appeal directly to the Secretary of the 
Ministry of Interior for relief.  Failing that, they may 
register a case in the Pakistani court system. 
 
c) If a former child camel jockey requests but is denied 
compensation through the MOU claims process, does the MOU 
permit the child or his parents then to seek compensation in 
your country's courts?  In the courts of the UAE?  In the 
courts of third countries, including the United States?  The 
same process as above will prevail, appeal to the Secretary 
of the Ministry, then registration of a court case in 
Pakistan. 
 
d) If a former child camel jockey requests and receives 
compensation that he or his parents believe is inadequate, 
does the MOU permit the child or his parents then to seek 
additional compensation in your country's courts?  In the 
courts of the UAE?  In courts of third countries, including 
the United States? Same process -- appeal to the Secretary of 
the Ministry, followed by a court case in Pakistan. 
 
e) If the claims facility does not in fact operate in 
accordance with the MOU, will court actions that would 
otherwise be barred by the MOU become permissible? Yes, if 
the facility fails to operate as envisioned in the MOU, the 
government of Pakistan reserves the option of initiating 
court action (on behalf of the children) against the UAE in 
Pakistani courts or at an international forum. 
 
f) What steps is your government taking to ensure that the 
child camel jockeys (and their parents) are aware of the 
claims process and to facilitate the filing of claims?  In 
addition to media (radio, television and print) campaigns, 
the GOP will request local religious and social leaders in 
the affected areas to strongly promote the process.  The GOP 
will create mobile teams to visit the areas where the camel 
jockeys were recruited to explain the claims process and help 
process claims.  The GOP already has a list of several 
hundred child jockeys repatriated from the UAE in the past 
few years, so they know the general magnitude of the problem 
at hand. 
 
g) Would a lawsuit in the United States seeking compensation 
for former child camel jockeys have any impact on the 
implementation of the claims facility or of the UAE-UNICEF 
program in your country?  It would be difficult to say at 
present.  Such a move could complicate the MOU process and 
may slow down the compensation/rehabilitation process.
