SUBJECT: FRANCE'S ASIA RELIEF EFFORTS VIA DJIBOUTI 
 
 
¶1. (U) France's Ambassador to Djibouti, Philippe Selz, told 
Ambassador January 6 that because of Djibouti's location, 
France would be using resources of its forces based here to 
assist with France's overall effort to assist tsunami 
disaster victims in Asia. 
 
¶2. (U) Selz told Ambassador that the French helicopter vessel 
"Jeanne d'Arc" ended prematurely on January 3 its visit to 
Djiboutian territorial waters in order to assist with Asian 
relief efforts.  The vessel departed Djibouti on that date 
for Thailand and Indonesia, filled to the brim with resources 
taken primarily from stocks of the French military outposts 
in Djibouti.  According to Selz, the "Jeanne d'Arc" carried 
seven tons of pharmaceuticals, three helicopters, logistical 
materials to assist in removing debris and building 
structures, 100,000 liters of bottled fresh water, 2000 
folding cots, a high volume of field rations, four medical 
experts from Bouffard Hospital in Djibouti, inflatable tanks 
for water, and products with which to treat water.  He said 
the ship was fully loaded, to the extent that it was forced 
to dismantle some of its pallets and fit items under sleeping 
berths and behind doors to enable transport of all the 
materials.  The vessel also carried, the French Ambassador 
stated, about 45-50 military personnel to assist with the 
relief effort.  The vessel is scheduled to reach its 
destination on January 10. 
 
¶3. (U) Selz commented that the "Jeanne d'Arc" "exhausted" 
most of the reserve items the French military had in 
Djibouti.  He said he expected that French forces in Djibouti 
would be asked to do more in the coming days.
