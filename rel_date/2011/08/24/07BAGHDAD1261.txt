Erbil, Kurdistan region (Iraq), (KUNA) - PNA - An Iraqi 
Kurdish official said on Monday, Kurdish people were seeking 
to have one-to-one dialogue with Turkish leaders to ponder 
over unsettled disputes between both sides. 
 
Fouad Hussein, of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Presidency, said 
in news remarks that Kurdish leaders had extended their hands 
to political leaders in Turkey, and there were several 
efforts to sit and negotiate with them, but, unfortunately, 
Ankara used to respond in the negative.  "If a clear-cut 
invitation is extended to any official in Kurdistan (for a 
meeting), with an unequivocal and articulate agenda, then the 
response will be in the positive.  Relevant efforts were 
exerted, and a date was set for a meeting with Mr. Prime 
Minister of Kurdistan with Turkish officials.  But, 
regrettably, the meeting was canceled at the last moment," he 
said.  However, he affirmed that Kurdish leaders did not 
support Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) elements.  "We have 
repeatedly said that we do not poke our noses into the 
affairs of neither Turkey nor Iran, neither do we back 
violence or PKK elements on the border between Turkey and 
Iraq or the border between Turkey and Iran."  "Kurdish people 
do not use the language of threatening against anybody in our 
political dictionary.  Instead, we used to adopt the language 
of self-defense to defend our land and Kurdistani society. 
But, at the same time, we cannot allow others to use the 
language of threatening against the Iraqi people or 
Kurdistan's people." End Text.
