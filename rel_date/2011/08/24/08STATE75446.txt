REF: USUN 618 
 
¶1. Somalia UN Mission Charge Idd Mohamed has raised his 
opposition to the appointment of Matt Bryden as chair of the 
Monitoring Group for the UNSC Somalia Sanctions Committee 
multiple times, including by Press Release.  U.S. Special 
Envoy Yates previously spoke with the Somali Transitional 
Federal Government (TFG) Prime Minister Hussein to discuss 
their concerns.  PM Hussein indicated that Mohamed was 
not/not acting under orders of the TFG and any communications 
protesting against Bryden,s appointment, such as the Somali 
UN Mission's letter to the UNSC Presidency or subsequent 
Press Release, do not represent the TFG position. 
 
¶2.  Department does not consider credible Mohamed's claims 
that the TFG would: cease all cooperation and 
information-sharing with the Monitoring Group (MG); refuse to 
issue visas to Bryden and other MG members; and urge 
Somalia's neighbors to curtail cooperation.  The Bureau of 
African Affairs confirms that this issue was not/not raised 
during A/S Frazer,s meeting with TFG President Abdullahi 
Yusuf Ahmed at the African Union Summit in Sharm el Sheikh as 
asserted by Mohamed.  Given Mohamed,s misinterpretation of 
facts on this and previous occasions, any subsequent 
assertions by Mohamed should be received with caution. 
 
¶3.  Department will continue to follow-up with the TFG to 
ensure MG will receive their cooperation.  It is expected 
that Mohamed will continue to raise objections to Matt 
Bryden's role as Coordinator of the Somalia Monitoring Group. 
 However, as Mohamed does not appear to be acting on 
instructions from Mogadishu, USUN's best response would be to 
receive Mohamed demarches without comment.  USUN may also 
wish to inform other UNSC Somalia Sanctions Committee members 
that we have consulted with the TFG leadership and they do 
not object to Bryden's role as Coordinator of the Monitoring 
Group. 
 
¶4.  Department appreciates Mission's efforts.
