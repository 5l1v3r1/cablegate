SUBJECT: HAMAS MAKES CHARITY AND SALARY PAYMENTS FOR RAMADAN 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) Former Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister 
Ismayil Haniyah of Hamas told worshippers at a Gaza mosque on 
September 14 that his Gaza administration would pay USD 100 
each to 40,000 unemployed Palestinians during Ramadan. 
Haniyah also pledged to cover USD 12 million in salaries for 
16,000 public sector employees whom the PA has cut from the 
payroll.  Ismayil Mahfuz, a Hamas "deputy finance minister" 
in Gaza, reportedly said his "ministry" has funds available 
to cover Haniyah's pledges.  Mahfuz added that the "ministry 
of labor" will prepare a list of persons eligible to receive 
the USD 100 unemployment payment and distribute vouchers to 
them. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In another example of Hamas' Ramadan campaign, 
Haniyah announced a USD 50,000 donation to Kamal Udwan 
Hospital in Bayt Lahiya, northern Gaza.  A delegation of 
Hamas Palestinian Legislative Council members delivered the 
money to the hospital director on September 16. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Palestinian contacts in Gaza tell us that Hamas 
appears to have sufficient funds to cover its Ramadan 
promises.  They report that Hamas has been paying "loyal" 
government workers for the past two months.  The payments are 
usually made directly in cash or through post offices. 
(Comment:  The cash payments are generally made in dollars. 
End comment.)  Hamas is also resorting to what one source 
called "ad hoc tax and duty collection" and other creative 
revenue-raising measures -- for example, collecting "duties" 
from anyone entering Gaza with cigarettes or alcohol, 
charging fees to "legalize" cars without papers, and 
collecting electricity bill payments door-to-door (all in 
cash).  Hamas, he said, is "very effective in collecting 
money."
