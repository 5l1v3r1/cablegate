REF: SECSTATE 150164 
 
We discussed reftel declaration and next steps with Trini 
Gunarti, Deputy Director for North American Affairs at the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, on November 27.  Gunarti 
welcomed the announcement and said she would forward it to 
senior officials.  She asked whether the declaration had any 
legal or political implications for Indonesia.  We said that 
it did not, but that it charted a course toward normal 
relations with Iraq which Indonesia and other countries could 
follow.
