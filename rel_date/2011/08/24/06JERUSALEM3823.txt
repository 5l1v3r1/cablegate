Military Developments 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.    (SBU) Palestinian gunmen, reportedly affiliated with 
the Popular Resistance Committees, on August 24 detonated an 
explosive device near the wall dividing Egypt from Gaza.  The 
explosion caused damage to the wall but was not large enough 
to enable passage for Palestinians seeking to transit the 
Rafah crossing.  PA and Egyptian security personnel responded 
to the explosion and successfully brought the situation under 
control.  The gunmen eventually left and the PA security 
restored order at 1430L. 
 
¶3.    (SBU) During an IDF incursion near Khan Younis 
overnight August 23-24, IDF soldiers shot and killed a Hamas 
gunman while arresting a senior Hamas activist.  Four other 
Hamas gunmen were injured during the exchange of gunfire. 
IDF units opened fire at two PIJ gunmen, injuring both, in 
the vicinity of the security fence near the Kissufim 
crossing.  A 16-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed 
during the exchange of gunfire.  Israeli naval units shelled 
open areas of the northern and central Gaza Strip, but there 
were no reported injuries.  PIJ claimed responsibility for 
the firing of a rocket towards Ashkelon on August 24.  There 
were no reported injuries or property damage. 
 
¶4.    (SBU) In the West Bank, IDF undercover units operating 
in Jenin on the evening of August 23 shot and critically 
wounded Husam Jaradat, a senior member of the PIJ military 
wing.  Jaradat was briefly hospitalized before PIJ gunmen 
took him away fearing that the IDF might seek his arrest. 
The IDF overnight August 23-24 arrested 24 Palestinians, 
mostly Hamas activists, in several localities in the West 
Bank.
