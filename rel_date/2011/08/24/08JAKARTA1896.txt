RESOLUTION ON CYBER-SECURITY 
 
REF: STATE 107427 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Mission reviewed reftel points with the 
GOI, urging it to reject the proposed Russian UNGA First 
Committee resolution on telecommunications and international 
security.  Department of Foreign Affairs contact promised to 
review the USG position and provide us any substantive 
reaction.  Mission will also review the matter with GOI 
agencies that handle telecommunications and cybersecurity 
issues and report any reaction by septel.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Poloff presented reftel demarche and nonpaper to 
Andy Rachmianto, Deputy Director for International Security 
and Nonproliferation at the Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DEPLU), on October 10.  Poloff noted that the proposed 
Russian resolution would establish an ineffective mechanism 
for addressing cyberthreats to international security.  The 
resolution would also allow repressive regimes to block the 
free flow of ideas across national boundaries.  As a country 
committed to democracy and openness, Indonesia should oppose 
the resolution. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Rachmianto said that Indonesia did not yet have a 
position on the issue.  He promised that GOI officials would 
review USG views and get back to us with any substantive 
reaction. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Mission will also review the matter with GOI 
agencies that are responsible for telecommunications and 
information technology issues and report any substantive 
reaction by septel.
