REF: STATE 82062 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Due to the August 8-15 visit to Sudan of 
Presidential Envoy to Sudan Richard Williamson, Post regrets that it 
will be unable to fully support the visit by CoDel Payne to Southern 
Sudan during reftel timeframe.  Unfortunately, the proposed August 
9-11 dates for CoDel Payne to US ConGen Juba and Abyei overlap 
exactly with the confirmed dates of travel and meetings in Juba and 
Abyei of SE Williamson.   Post does not have staff or other 
resources to support both visits simultaneously.  However, Khartoum 
would welcome CoDel Payne's visit if proposed dates could be delayed 
by 24 hours to an August 10 arrival and August 12 departure. 
Otherwise, Post recommends CoDel postpone travel to Sudan to a later 
time that does not conflict with another VIP delegation.   End 
Summary 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) US Embassy Khartoum and US ConGen Juba will be hosting a 
visit by Presidential Special Envoy Richard Williamson from August 8 
to August 15, 2008. SE Williamson, CDA Alberto Fernandez, the 
five-person staff of the SE, two embassy Poloffs, and one A/RSO have 
confirmed travel to Juba on Saturday, August 9. The delegation will 
be staying on the compound of US ConGen Juba on Saturday, August 9, 
and traveling to Abyei and Agok by charter plane and UNMIS 
helicopter on Sunday, August 10. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) US ConGen Juba operates with extremely limited resources in 
a dangerous and unstable environment; accommodating two VIP visits 
simultaneously exceeds US ConGen Juba's capacity for assisting 
official travel.  US ConGen Juba is currently staffed by the Consul 
General and  Juba RSO and local staff, which will be engaged to the 
maximum along with Khartoum TDY assistance to support the SE 
delegation.   US ConGen Juba does not have enough vehicles to 
transport both delegations safely and expeditiously.  Post requires 
official travelers to spend the night on the US ConGen Juba 
compound, and unfortunately the compound also cannot accommodate two 
delegations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) For these reasons, Embassy Sudan must respectfully decline 
a visit by CoDel Payne in the August 9-11 timeframe.  However, 
Khartoum would welcome CoDel Payne's visit if proposed dates can be 
moved by 24 hours -i.e. to an August 10 arrival and August 12 
departure.  This would de-conflict scheduling for the two 
delegations.  Pls. advise on proposed 24 hour delay in arrival.
