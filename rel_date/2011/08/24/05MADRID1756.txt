SUBJECT: SPAIN'S VIEWS ON PREVENTING AN UNMANDATED SESSION 
ON CHR REFORM 
 
REF: STATE 82967 
 
¶1.  Poloff discussed reftel demarche with Juan Manuel 
Gonzales de Linares, Deputy Director General for UN Affairs 
at the MFA.  Gonzales de Linares confirmed to poloff that 
Spain shares U.S. views and is against a Working Group to 
discuss human rights reform in Geneva.  Gonzales de Linares 
said that the GOS favors resolving Commission on Human Rights 
(CHR) reform issues in New York.  The GOS was "shocked" to 
find out that the budgetary implications of a CHR meeting in 
Geneva would exceed USD 265,000. 
 
¶2.  When Gonzales de Linares was asked if he agreed with all 
of our points, he responded that the GOS favors resolving CHR 
reform issues in New York under ECOSOC because the CHR had 
previous opportunities to address this issue in April, not 
necessarily because the CHR has no independent mandate to 
discuss its own reform.  The GOS believes that the CHR has 
such a mandate because of precedents set in 1994 with 
previous Working Groups.
