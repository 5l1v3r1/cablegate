SUBJECT: ASSISTANCE TO GEORGIA: DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 100093 
 
¶1. (U)  EmbOffs delivered reftel demarche regarding the 
upcoming Georgia donors conference in Brussels to Tomasz 
Orlowski, Georgia desk officer at the Polish MFA, as well as 
Barbara Gronowska and Joanna Poplawska in the MFA's 
Development Cooperation Department on September 22.  The MFA 
is working with the Finance Ministry to determine how much 
room there is in Poland's budget to make a donation, but no 
decisions have yet been made. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Orlowski also stated that the overall amount of 
assistance granted to date by the Polish government stands at 
PLN 190,000 (about USD 83,000).  Orlowski informed us that 
the MFA intends to spend a "significant sum of money" to 
support activities of the International Organization for 
Migration as a response to its "Georgia Crisis-Flash Appeal," 
which was published within the framework of the UN Common 
Appeals Process (CAP).  Final decision has not been made on 
whether and how much support will be provided.  In addition, 
the Polish government is considering financial support to 
winterize housing for 100 refugees from the conflict zone in 
Georgia.
