SUBJECT: GLOBAL INITIATIVE TO COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM, 
MODEL GUIDELINES DOCUMENT (MGD) FOLLOW-ON WORKSHOP, APRIL 
20-22, 2009 
 
REF: SECSTATE 9099 
 
¶1. We provided MFA Nonproliferation and Disarmament Section 
Chief Mustafa Yurdakul February 5 with information regarding 
the April 20-22 Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
(GICNT) Model Guidelines Document (MGD) Follow-on Workshop 
(reftel), and encouraged Turkey to send participants and to 
lead one of the breakout sessions at the workshop. 
 
¶2. Yurdakul expressed Turkey's support for international 
cooperation to prevent nuclear terrorism, but noted Turkey's 
well-known reluctance to engage in GICNT-related activities 
(Note: Due to the participation of Cyprus.  End Note).  He 
said he was not optimistic that Turkey will send 
participants. 
 
¶3. We underscored the technical nature of this workshop and 
noted that Turkey may find the discussion on developing a 
model guideline useful.  Yurdakul acknowledged that Turkey is 
not opposed to sending experts to participate in technical 
meetings within the framework of GICNT and agreed to relay 
the information to relevant GOT offices for further 
consideration.
