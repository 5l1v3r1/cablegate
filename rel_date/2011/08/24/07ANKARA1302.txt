In Today's Papers 
 
US Jetfighters Violate Turkish Airspace 
All papers report over the weekend and today the Turkish General 
Staff (TGS) said in a statement posted on its website late Sunday 
that two US F-16 jetfighters had violated Turkish airspace on May 24 
for four minutes in the province of Hakkari on the border with Iraq. 
 The violation is seen by several papers and commentators as a 
"challenge," demonstrating that US forces were closely monitoring 
Turkish troop movements along the Iraqi border.  Foreign Minister 
Abdullah Gul said such things sometimes happen in border areas, 
adding said the Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) was still awaiting 
details from the TGS.  He noted that Ankara would decide on what to 
do after receiving a technical report from the military indicating 
whether the violation was intentional and the duration of the 
incursion.  MFA sources are quoted as saying summoning the US 
Ambassador in Turkey to the Foreign Ministry or even a diplomatic 
note of protest were under consideration, depending on the technical 
report that the General Staff sends.  Papers report US Ankara 
Embassy said the crossing of the US jetfighters into Turkish 
airspace was inadvertent, and that the incident was under 
investigation. 
 
Editorial Commentary on US Violation of Turkish Airspace 
Sami Kohen observes in the mainstream daily Milliyet: "It is even 
beyond imagining that two allies, the US and Turkey, would engage in 
a hot conflict over Northern Iraq.  This kind of development can 
only bring very serious consequences for both sides.  Let's hope 
that this will never ever happen.  However a concrete effort is also 
needed to ensure that we do not come closer to that point.  The 
effort should be pursued at the highest possible level and Turkey 
does not have the luxury of ignoring this fact in the midst of the 
election excitement.  The US and other coalition partners are 
responsible for emphasizing the need for strong cooperation with 
Turkey to the Kurdish administration and to the central authority in 
Baghdad to counter terrorism.  While the US suggests Turkey not act 
unilaterally in northern Iraq against the terrorist shelters, is the 
US doing anything to act together with Iraqis on this issue?  The 
lack of concrete action is the main reason for the current 
circumstances. A constructive and urgent dialogue - that's what we 
need at this point." 
 
Okay Gonensin writes in the mainstream daily Vatan: "Given the 
current situation in Turkey, everybody seems ready for the 
possibility of a cross-border operation in Northern Iraq.  The 
American administration, which keep Iraq under occupation and 
considers the Kurds its most important allies in Iraq, clearly and 
repeatedly expressed its opposition to a cross-border incursion. 
The recent violation by two American F-16 jets can also be 
interpreted as a message to Turkey.  It is debatable whether a 
cross-border operation can really be a serious blow to the PKK.  An 
operation in northern Iraq means an armed conflict with both Kurds 
and American forces there. When and if Turkish forces cross the 
border, it will only bring serious economic and political 
consequences. Regardless of the excuses, the consequences of war are 
borne by people.  Turkey should never consider 'settling the issue 
with war' as an option." 
 
Iraq Urges Turkey to Use Diplomatic Means to Stop PKK 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman and others 
report Monday and today that Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Barham 
Salih told reporters after meeting with a Turkish delegation in 
Baghdad that Iraq would not accept a breach of its sovereignty. 
Iraq urged Turkey over the weekend to pursue diplomatic means as it 
attempts to stop the PKK terrorists operating out of northern Iraq. 
Turkey's special Iraq envoy Oguz Celikkol, the head of the 
delegation to Baghdad, said a number of issues had been discussed, 
including Ankara's growing uneasiness at recent violence it blames 
on the PKK.

Parliament Overrides Sezer's Constitutional Reforms Veto 
All papers report that on Monday the Turkish Parliament approved 
constitutional reforms including the election of the president by 
direct popular vote, overriding the veto of President Sezer.  The 
bill also envisages holding parliamentary elections every four years 
instead of five, requires a quorum of at least one third of total 
number of MPs for convening parliamentary sessions, and reducing the 
presidential term to a renewable five years.  Sezer cannot veto the 
legislation a second time if it is unchanged.  He must either 
approve the law or call for a referendum. 
 
US Congressional Delegation in Turkey 
All papers report that US Congressional delegation led by Edward 
Whitfield, the co-chairman of Congressional Caucus on Turkish-US 
relations, and a Senate Delegation headed by Senator E. Benjamin 
Nelson held meetings at the Turkish General Staff and also met with 
Prime Minister Erdogan and Foreign Minister Gul.  Responding to the 
questions after meeting the PM, Whitfield said "The US is telling 
Turkey not to intervene in Iraq.  But on the other hand the Turkish 
public and soldiers are loosing their lives. The US needs to take 
concrete steps but we are not urging military action."  Mainstream 
Sabah reports the visit with the headline "Support from US 
Senators." 
 
Lagendijk will Visit East & Southeast of Turkey Prior to the 
Elections 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports that prior to the July 22 
elections, European Parliament's Turkey-EU Joint Parliamentary 
Commission Co-Chairman Joost Lagendijk will have meetings with the 
local people in Van, Hakkari and Mardin to observe developments 
connected to the election.
