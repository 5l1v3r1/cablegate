SUBJECT: NSC TALKING POINTS ON TRILATERAL SUMMIT 
 
¶1.  General Talking Points: 
The United States hosted a Trilateral Summit between the 
United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan in Washington, 
D.C. on May 6 and 7. 
 
¶2.  The Summit consisted of two days of intense 
consultations between President Karzai, President Zardari, 
their respective cabinets and the U.S. Government at the 
highest level. 
 
¶3.  These meetings featured U.S. involvement by the 
President and the Vice-President as well as Secretary of 
State Clinton, Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack, FBI 
Director Mueller, CIA Director Panetta, Special 
Representative Holbrooke, CENTCOM Commander General 
Petraeus, Defense Under-Secretary Flournoy, USAID Acting 
Administrator Fulgham, and other senior U.S. Government 
officials. 
 
¶4.  On May 6, after meeting with President Karzai and 
President Zardari, President Obama spoke to the press. He 
called these meetings important and reiterated the United 
States' lasting commitment to supporting these two 
democratically-elected, sovereign, civilian governments 
and to defeating Al Qaeda. 
 
¶5.  It was clear from these meetings that both President 
Karzai and President Zardari fully appreciate the 
seriousness of the common threat that we face. 
 
¶6.  During the meetings, both President Karzai and 
President Zardari reaffirmed their commitment to confront 
the threat by working together and working with us to 
disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda and its extremist 
allies in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their 
ability to operate in either country. 
 
¶7.  We agreed that it is imperative we deny these 
terrorists the space to threaten Pakistani, Afghan, or 
American people, or those of any other nation, and agreed 
that we must advance security and opportunity, so that 
Pakistanis and Afghans can pursue the promise of a better 
life. This includes creating economic bonds and improving 
relations between the two countries. 
 
¶8.  In particular, on the border, we discussed the need to 
work together with a renewed sense of partnership, to 
share intelligence, and to coordinate our efforts to 
isolate, target and take out our common enemy. 
 
¶9.  These two days of discussions yielded an agreement to 
finalize a transit trade agreement, as well as pledges to 
cooperate on agriculture, trade, customs, water, and 
enhanced border security. The two sides also agreed to 
continue their cross-border jirga process to build 
consensus in the population against extremists and Al 
Qaeda. 
 
¶10.  There is trust between leaders at personal level in 
the Governments of Afghanistan, Pakistan and the United 
States. Building trust and cooperation between 
institutions will be the major challenge and a key focus 
of our efforts. 
 
¶11.  We believe this Summit has provided an important 
venue to improve -- if not generate -- dialogue on a 
number of important issues and served to expand the 
potential of bilateral and trilateral cooperation beyond 
security to virtually every matter of mutual interest. 
 
¶12.  Cooperation among our three countries is essential to 
peace, security and development in the region. The United 
States looks forward to continuing close cooperation with 
the Governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan in the future. 
 
¶13.  Major Summit Deliverables: Historic Signing of the 
Transit Trade Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The 
signature by the Afghan and Pakistani Foreign Ministers of 
the Transit Trade Agreement MoU ends forty-three years of 
stalling on transit trade discussions between both 
countries and unlocks a potential of trade and economic 
growth. In follow-up during the trilateral session with 
Finance Ministers, Deputy scretary Lew got the two 
delegations to agree that they would conclude negotiations 
by September 30, 2009. 
 
¶14.  Continuing the cross-border jirga process to build 
 
STATE 00047496  002 OF 002 
 
 
consensus in the populations of both countries against 
extremists and Al Qaeda.  The Governments agreed to 
revitalize their cross-border jirga process.  This process 
aims to develop popular, tribal positions against 
extremists and in support of development. A mini-jirga 
held in Kabul after the Afghan elections (as a follow up 
of the October Islamabad mini-jirga) should be the next 
step. 
 
¶15.  Strengthening Border Coordination with two additional 
centers.  Both countries are committed to opening two 
additional border coordination centers (BCCs), one in 
Kandahar province and another inside Pakistan Federally 
Administered Tribal Areas by the end of 2009.  Foreign 
Minister Qureshi underscored for the Pakistani side that 
implementation should be carried out "expeditiously." 
 
¶16.  Opening a new era of cooperation on Agriculture. 
Pakistani Agriculture Minister Gondal and Afghan 
Agriculture Minister Rahimi met for the first time. The 
session hosted by Secretary Vilsack proved extremely 
successful. The three leaders set up a trilateral working 
group on food security, trade corridors and watershed 
management. Secretary Vilsack announced a plan to spend 
$27.5 million under the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Food for Progress program to help Pakistan and Afghanistan 
improve the sustainable development of their agricultural 
sectors. 
 
¶17.  Building new bridges on Internal Security 
Cooperation. Afghan Interior Minister Atmar and Pakistani 
Interior Minister Malik met for the first time. Initial 
steps towards major developments in law enforcement, 
border security and management were taken: establishment 
of focal points and a hotline between the two ministers, 
work towards an extradition treaty, exchange of list of 
terrorists. 
 
¶18.  Increased Intelligence sharing. Discussions focused 
on means to institutionalize exchanges between the Afghan 
National Directorate of Security (NDS) and the Pakistani 
Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) and enhance existing 
forms of intelligence sharing. 
 
¶19.  The Summit deliverables generated a dense agenda that 
requires continued consultations. The next round of 
Trilateral Consultations with interagency involvement will 
happen after the completion of the Afghan elections. 
Consultations at working level to follow up the most 
pressing issues may take place sooner.
