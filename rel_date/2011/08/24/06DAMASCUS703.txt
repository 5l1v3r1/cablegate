SUBJECT: Damascus Media Reaction: Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Cartoon 
Controversy, US Policy (2/21) 
 
¶1.  Summary: Syrian papers reported Lebanese rejection of the 
calls for foreign custodianship and the positions expressed by 
the "March 14" forces. 
 
Omar Jaftali editorialized in Tishreen that it is shameful that 
some Lebanese have sold themselves for a fistful of dollars. 
However, he said that most Lebanese will stand by the resistance 
and defeat any attempt at division or foreign dominance. 
 
On the cartoons published by western newspapers insulting the 
Prophet Mohammad, Ali Sahawa wrote in Al-Thawra that the cartoon 
controversy is part of a plan to enrage Muslims, who are on a 
collision course with Northern Europeans, who have high respect 
for human values and freedom of belief. 
 
 
 
End summary.

¶3.  Editorial Block Quotes: 
------------------------------------- 
 
"Arab Responsibility" 
 
------------------------------------- 
 
Omar Jaftali, an editorialist in government-owned Tishreen, 
commented (2/22): "What is happening at the moment in Lebanon is 
a sample of American-Israeli targeting, and is a link in the 
chain of projects of hegemony that needs to be implemented as a 
launching-pad for other targets that will complement other links 
in the chain. 
 
"The statements and behavior of some Lebanese symbols who are 
know for their shady alliances are unfortunate, even 
shameful.... But what is the benefit to those who call for 
foreign intervention in Lebanese affairs? It is a fistful of 
dollars in return for facilitating the foreign objectives of 
redrawing the map of the region to complete the hegemony over 
the region's capabilities and future. 
 
"The picture is not dark, as the national and pan-Arab awareness 
of most Lebanese will return bright colors to the picture on the 
basis of adherence to the dignity and resistance that have 
defeated all attempts at division and internationalization. 
 
------------------ 
 
 
"Who is Responsible for the Harm to Islam?" 
 
------------------ 
 
Ali Sawaha, a columnist in government-owned Al-Thawra, wrote 
(2/21): "Those who have harmed the feelings of the followers of 
the prophet Muhammad cannot be exonerated from their criminal 
acts, nor can those who republished those shameful images of the 
prophet that elicited the widest protests and denunciations on 
the international level, even in Europe and America. This comes 
within the framework of a criminal mentality that aims to 
provoke further clashes between nations and to drag them into 
religious conflicts that will bring nothing but destruction. 
 
"The choice of Northern Europe to spark the controversy is 
intended to provoke the Islamic street and push it to violent 
and angry behavior toward the peoples of countries who score 
high in terms of respect for humanity and freedom of belief. " 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
"Where is the Misleading Campaign Against Syria Heading?" 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
Mohammad Abdulkarim Mustafa, a columnist in government-owned Al- 
Thawra, wrote (2/21): "There has scarcely been an occasion of an 
American official appearing on the media without leveling 
accusations and criticisms against Syria, thrusting Syria's name 
into the forefront of statements by the U.S. Administration 
about the problems of the world. It is extremely strange to 
thrust Syria's name into all major and minor issues despite the 
fact that Syria's policy is one of the most constant and clear 
in terms of combating terrorism on the one hand, and standing 
with the oppressed and showing sympathy with peoples whose lands 
are occupied by force, on the other. 
 
"The U.S. Administration, at the instigation of the Zionist 
entity that practices organized terrorism inside and outside the 
occupied Palestinian territories, has always declined to specify 
a definition for this phenomena that concerns all humanity. The 
Likudites in the White House oppose and ignore the need to 
define terrorism, in order that the label of terrorism can be 
stuck onto any party that opposes U.S. policies or interests 
around the world. 
 
"The surprising thing is the participation of some Arab media 
outlets in this campaign [against Syria], serving Israeli 
interests and ignoring the credibility and objectivity that are 
expected by the Arab street from these outlets."
