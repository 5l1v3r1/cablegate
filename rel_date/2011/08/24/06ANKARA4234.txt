¶1. (U) In response to Task Force direction, Mission Turkey 
has prepared to use the port of  Mersin as an overflow 
evacuation point for AmCits departing Lebanon.  We intend to 
bus evacuees to Incirlik Air Base and conduct processing on 
the base.  Mission has directed all available existing 
resources to Consulate Adana and Incirlik Base.  We asses 
that our capability to process evacuees as of July 20 is 
approximately 200-400 daily.  As of July 21, we will be 
capable of processing 400-800 per day.  If we are to exceed 
this number ) and we understand there is a requirement to 
process 2500 per day beginning July 22 ) then we will 
require urgent TDY support (already provide to Task Force) 
and commitment of charter aircraft. 
 
¶2. (U) We expect an initial arrival of AmCits on July 20 via 
a Canadian chartered ferry.  We do not have a specific 
arrival time nor a passenger manifest.  Our latest 
information indicates that the first such ferry will arrive 
at Mersin after 2000 local July 20 with up to 27 Amcits on 
board.  Another ferry with an undetermined number of AmCits 
may arrive later the evening of 7/20. 
 
¶3. (U) A Consulate Adana/Incirlik team is prepared to meet 
any incoming boat.  We will bus them to Incirlik Airbase for 
processing and issuance of Turkish visas.  At that point, 
AmCits who do not wish to be repatriated to the US will be 
allowed to depart base for independently organized onward 
travel within Turkey or the region.  Those who wish to be 
repatriated to the US will remain on base and be billeted and 
fed until the arrival of commercially chartered aircraft. 
Incirlik Air Base has the capacity to billet and feed 800 at 
any one time and can surge up to 1300.  If we are required to 
drive up to a capacity of 2500 per day, evacuees will be 
billeted in a tent city, on cots and will be fed MREs. 
Ideally, we would hover around 1500 at any single time and 
need to focus on charter aircraft to move people onward.  39 
Wing Incirlik and Turkish base command are committed to 
working together to make this operation a success.  We also 
understand there is active consideration of bringing evacuees 
to Turkey from Akrotiri airbase in Cyprus via C-130s; we will 
need advance notice to clear these flights through 
appropriate GOT channels. 
 
¶4. (U) Visa requirements and customs issues:  The GOT has 
agreed to waive the USD20 visa fee for all incoming evacuees, 
regardless of nationality.  Incirlik has a 24/7 Turkish 
customs operation on base.  We are working with the Turks to 
determine if they can plus that up, to get agreement to do 
all processing, including Turkish visas (which will still 
need to be stamped in passports) and out-processing on base. 
 
¶5. (U) Visa requirements for TDY staff:  Turkish MFA has 
agreed that if we get names, port of entry and nationality of 
TDYers to them, they will send a message to the port of entry 
to issue a visa there, regardless of type of passport. 
 
¶6. (U) Incirlik charters:  Mission confirms that charters 
should be arranged to land at and depart from Incirlik.  GOT 
authorities concur. 
 
¶7. (U) Incirlik will support all our facilities needs for 
processing and control room.  We need TDYer names as soon as 
possible, especially TCN host national support so we may pass 
that information via diplomatic note to the MFA.
