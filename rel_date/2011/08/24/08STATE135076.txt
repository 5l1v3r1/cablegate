SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050136522 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-shipment check on application 050136522 for the export 
of M-113 component parts to Spain.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Lack of documentation from the 
Spanish MoD and unfamiliar foreign consignee, Zeltmann 
Import-Export GmbH.  The company has appeared on previous 
licenses but the company's bona fides have not been 
established by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION MADRID: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
 
appropriate host government officials to determine if the 
Spanish MoD (SMOD) ordered the M-113 component parts and if 
so, confirm that the articles will be used for the purpose 
stated on the license.  Post is requested to exercise its 
contacts within the SMOD to verify this order. 
END ACTION. 
 
¶5. ACTION BERLIN: Embassy is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate host government officials in order to establish 
the bona fides of unfamiliar foreign consignee Zeltmann 
Import-Export GmbH (Zeltmann) and to verify the legitimacy of 
this transaction.  PM/DTCC also requests that post conducts a 
site visit to the company in order to provide Department with 
an assessment of its business operations and on-site 
security.  Finally, post is asked to assess whether the 
company appears to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If 
a site visit is not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC 
officer. 
END ACTION 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation for this 
transaction?  Are all of the USML parts going to the Spanish 
MoD? 
 
--Does the company have proper accounting and security 
procedures for handling USML items? 
 
--Will Zeltmann retain positive control over the M-113 
component parts at all times? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
--Does the company understand the prohibition against the 
unauthorized stockpiling of USML items? 
 
END ACTION
