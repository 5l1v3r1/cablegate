¶1.  (U) The Egyptian Foreign Ministry issued a public 
statement May 21 that welcomed the formation and approval of 
Iraq's new cabinet May 20.  In the MFA's public statement, 
issued in the name of the Foreign Minister, Egypt called for 
the process of government formation to be completed via 
agreement on naming new Defense and Interior ministers. 
Similarly, Arab League Secretary General Amre Moussa - on the 
margins of the World Economic Forum in Sharm El Sheihk - told 
reporters he welcomed the agreement, calling the move a "step 
on the right path" in Iraq's political process.  Moussa also 
pointed to an expected gathering in late June of Iraqi 
leaders at an Arab-League sponsored National Accord 
Conference in Baghdad as an opportunity to move the process 
of political reconciliation further along. 
 
¶2.  (U) Text of MFA statement on Iraq: 
 
FM Abul Gheit welcomed the Iraqi Parliament's agreement to 
form a new Iraqi government under the premiership of Mr. 
Nouri Al-Maliki.  Within the same context, Abul Gheit 
expressed confidence that all concerned Iraqi parties would 
reach agreement regarding the Minister of Interior and 
Minister of Defense positions, a decision which would allow 
the new Cabinet to shoulder its responsibilities and perform 
its missions and at the same time enable the Iraqi people to 
achieve their aspirations for security, stability, and 
prosperity.  Abul Gheit stressed the importance of the Iraqi 
people's unity in face of terrorist acts and attempts by some 
to sow the seeds of sedition and sectarianism.  He also 
emphasized the Egyptian people's solidarity with the people 
of Iraq and asserted that Egypt would never spare any efforts 
in extending assistance to them.
