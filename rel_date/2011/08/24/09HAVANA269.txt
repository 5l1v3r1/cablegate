SUBJECT: H1N1: FIRST CASE IN CUBA; FIDEL ADMITS NOT PART OF 
CIA PLOT 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. Cuba confirmed its first case of the H1N1 virus in a 
Mexican medical student who returned to the island days 
before Cuba became the first country to suspend flights from 
Mexico on April 29.  Fidel Castro defended Cuba's (over) 
reaction to the outbreak and made a few accusations of his 
own along the way in response to Mexican President Calderon's 
statement last week that Cuba's suspension of flights will 
prevent him from visiting Cuba in the near future as 
previously intended.  The U.S. Interests Section (USINT) 
remains prepared in case of a further spread of the virus in 
Cuba.

FIRST CASE - MEXICAN MEDICAL STUDENT 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  The Cuban Ministry of Public Health announced on Tuesday, 
May 11 the first confirmed case of the H1N1 virus in Cuba. 
The Cuban Institute of Tropical Medicine confirmed the virus 
in a Mexican medical student studying in Jaguey Grande, 
Matanzas (a province just east of Havana) who had returned to 
Cuba from a vacation in Mexico on or around April 25.  He was 
one of 84 people from eight countries, including 14 Mexican 
students, who have been identified with possible symptoms. 
An additional 511 persons have been identified as having had 
contact with the symptomatic cases.  We do not know the 
nationalities of the other symptomatic cases, nor do we know 
whether any Cubans were among those tested.  The Ministry of 
Public Health said that out of all these cases, only the one 
Mexican student has been identified as positive for the H1N1 
virus.  The Ministry did not report on the well being or 
whereabouts of the infected student, but assured the public 
that they have adopted the corresponding measures appropriate 
for this evolving international situation. 
 
¶3.  The Cuban Institute of Civil Aviation had issued an order 
suspending regular and charter flights operating between Cuba 
and Mexico as of April 29, a decision that remains in effect 
with the exception of a few Cubana Airline flights and some 
flights returning passengers from Cuba to Mexico.  All 
passengers who arrive in the country from any destination are 
to fill out a Traveler's Health Declaration form.  Travelers 
arriving from Mexico immediately prior to the suspension of 
flights disembarked at Terminal 2 traditionally used for 
charter flights from the United States rather than the usual 
International Terminal.  Travelers were greeted by health 
officials who asked whether they had any symptoms of the 
disease in the last ten days and whether they had been in 
contact with anyone infected.  Travelers were then asked to 
fill out the health declaration form and handed a card with 
information about what to do if they experienced any flu-like 
symptoms, specifically to present the card to a doctor at one 
of the points of the National Health System.

FIDEL ON CALDERON AND CIA INVOLVEMENT 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  A few hours after the Ministry of Public Heath 
announcement, Fidel Castro published a new "Reflecciones" 
article in which he acknowledged the presence of the virus in 
Cuba.  He added that "the one thing that can be confirmed now 
is that it was not the CIA that introduced it.  It came from 
Mexico."  Castro went on to criticize Mexican President 
Calderon for "complaining" about Cuba's decision to suspend 
flights from Mexico.  Castro quoted from Calderon's statement 
last week that Calderon was going to go to Cuba in the coming 
days or weeks, but since Cuba has cancelled flights from 
Mexico he won't be able to go.  Castro said that the Mexican 
students are in no way guilty and he referenced last month's 
final declaration from the Non-Aligned Movement supporting 
the people and Government of Mexico. Castro said that the 
Mexican authorities did not inform the world of the presence 
of the flu virus before President Obama's visit, and now they 
are threatening to suspend Calderon's trip.  Castro added 
that "at this point, we and dozens of other countries are 
 
HAVANA 00000269  002 OF 002 
 
 
paying the piper and on top of that we are being accused of 
using harmful measures against Mexico."

¶5.  The U.S. Interests Section has adequate supplies of PPE 
and anti-viral medications.  We have developed trip wires to 
provide guidance during an influenza pandemic and are in 
touch with the local offices of the World Health Organization 
and Pan American Health Organization.
