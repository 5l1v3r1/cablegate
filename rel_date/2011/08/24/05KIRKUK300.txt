(U) SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PROTECT ACCORDINGLY.  NOT FOR 
INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  China seeks better relations and trade with 
Iraq's Kurdistan Region, including oil.  Kurdistan is officially 
autonomous, but foreign relations remain the prerogative of the 
Iraqi national government, so the Kurds' dealings with China are 
handled through the dominant political parties.  The main oil 
field in northern Iraq lies in Kirkuk province, which the Kurds 
seek to incorporate into Kurdistan but is currently outside the 
autonomous Kurdistan Region.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kosrat Rasul Ali, a senior official of the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan (PUK), briefed Regional Coordinator December 
21 on his October trip to China at the head a PUK delegation. 
He explained that the visit was at the invitation of the 
Communist Party of China (CPC; a CPC delegation visited Iraq's 
Kurdistan Region last May).  Kosrat said the Chinese wanted two 
things:  to mend fences with Iraq and the Kurds after having 
been staunch supporters of Saddam Hussein, and trade.  Kosrat 
claimed he had told his hosts the United States is the liberator 
of Iraq and protector of democracy, and that he had urged them 
not to support dictatorships (Syria and Iran).  He said his 
hosts heard the message but did not necessarily like it. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Another senior PUK official, Noshirwan Mustafa, 
confirmed to Regional Coordinator that the Chinese were trying 
to "clean their face" after their close ties to Saddam.  He said 
they specifically wanted "oil, telephone (i.e., a contract for a 
telephone network) and trade." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The PUK, which runs Sulaymaniyah, and the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which runs Erbil and Dahuk, 
are actively promoting trade and investment, with some success: 
Kurdistan is significantly more secure than most of Iraq, and 
between them, the PUK and KDP have been firmly in control of the 
Kurdistan Region since the early 1990s, thanks to the protection 
of the US-UK northern no-fly zone.  The autonomy of the 
Kurdistan Region is enshrined in both the Transitional 
Administrative Law (TAL, the temporary constitution which has 
been in force throughout Iraq until now) and the permanent 
constitution adopted by referendum in October.  However, foreign 
relations remain the prerogative of Iraq's national government, 
therefore the Kurds' dealings with China are handled in party 
channels rather than governmental channels. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED:  Most intriguing is Noshirwan 
Mustafa's reference to oil.  The main oil field in northern Iraq 
is in Kirkuk province, which the Kurds openly seek to 
incorporate into Kurdistan but is currently outside the 
autonomous Kurdistan Region.
