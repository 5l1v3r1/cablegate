SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT:

¶1.  Mideast 
 
¶2.  PM Olmert Visit to Russia 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Ha'aretz headlined that the US and Israel see eye to eye regarding 
the Syrian option and are both against opening a separate 
Israel-Syrian track.  This tendency comes after the meeting between 
Public Security Minister Avi Dichter met US National Security 
Advisor Steve Hadley in Washington on Thursday. 
 
Maariv headlined that Industrialist Stef Wertheimer is initiating a 
plan to rehabilitate the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza and Judea 
and Samaria. According to the plan, Wertheimer himself will invest a 
great deal of money in the project, and also will undertake to 
gather together other investors in order to raise the funds. In the 
framework of the plan, a pilot of which is being planned now, 
industrial areas, sources of employment, modern residential housing 
and infrastructures will be built in the refugee camps in Gaza, 
Nablus, Ramallah, Kalkilya, and other places.  In this manner, 
Wertheimer believes, the tension in the area will decline and a 
foundation will be laid for political negotiations in the future. 
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is a side to the secretive plan and 
according to sources was enthusiastic about it. 
 
All media cited French General Alain Pellegrini, commander of the UN 
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as saying on Thursday that Israeli 
warplanes had violated UN ceasefire resolution 1701 by entering 
Lebanese airspace. Pellegrini said that France had placed 
anti-aircraft missile batteries in southern Lebanon, although, as of 
now, these missiles are only for self defense, to protect the French 
soldiers in the peace force. He said, Israel's flights over Lebanon 
are a violation of the cease-fire agreement, and if the current 
diplomatic efforts are unable to put an end to these flights, it may 
be necessary in the future to consider shooting at the Israeli 
planes in Lebanon. 
Kol Israel reported that six Qassam rockets were fired this morning 
towards southern towns in Israel. No damage caused. 
Kol Israel this morning reported that on the way back from Moscow 
Prime Minister Olmert said that the moment of truth with the 
Palestinians is approaching and that Palestinian Authority Chairman 
Mahmoud Abbas will have to take action or all hopes will be lost. 
The radio also cited a senior official from PM Olmert's office as 
saying that Abbas wanted Israel to release hundreds of Palestinian 
prisoners prior to the release of Corporal Shalit, a proposal that 
Israel refused. 
All media reported that the IDF continued its operation in the Gaza 
Strip on Thursday reveling additional smuggling tunnels.  The media 
noted that 13 tunnels have been found and six of them were already 
blown up.  Ha'aretz cited military sources as saying that the extent 
of weapon smuggling from Egypt into Gaza is even more severe then 
assumed. 
 
Kol Israel this morning reported that Fatah and Hamas officials 
reached an agreement on Thursday night to cease incitement and 
violence between the rival factions in the Palestinian Authority, in 
honor of the conclusion of the month of Ramadan. 
 
All media reported that Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri 
yesterday called for the resumption of peace talks between Israel 
and the Arab states.  Yediot quoted Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as 
saying that Nabih's declaration is interesting. 
Kol Israel this morning cited Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
as saying on Friday that Israel no longer had any reason to exist 
and would soon disappear.  Addressing the US and its allies he said: 
"It is in your own interest to distance yourself from these 
criminals... This is an ultimatum. Don't complain tomorrow." 
 
Ha'aretz reported on growing concern among IDF officers that Hamas 
and other militant Palestinian organizations are trying to carry out 
terror attacks against one of the Kibbutzim close to the Gaza Strip. 
 
 
Ha'aretz reported on the meeting between Infrastructure Minister 
Binyamin Ben Eliezer with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak.  Ben 
Eliezer was quoted as saying after the meeting that he is optimistic 
regarding the possibility of the release of Corporal Gilad Shalit. 
 
Ha'aretz published a Peace Now survey in which it was found that 
some parts of 75 of the 102 outposts in the West Bank are on private 
Palestinian land. 
 
Ha'aretz cited a Human Rights Watch report claiming that Hizbullah 
fired cluster bombs at Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. 
 
Yediot reported that in an interim inquiry made by the Air Force it 
was found that the Air Force planes that attacked thousands of times 
during the war often left on their missions without the ideal 
ammunition due to shortage in bombs.

¶1.  Mideast:

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Military correspondent Amir Rappaport reported in popular, pluralist 
Maariv: "The Palestinians in Gaza are having a hard time but the 
time is playing mainly against Israel.  Every day that passes by 
brings the Hamas closer to adopting Hizbullah's model."

"Second Lebanon" 
 
Military correspondent Amir Rappaport reported in popular, pluralist 
Maariv (10/20): "The Palestinians in Gaza are having a hard time but 
the time is playing mainly against Israel.  Every day that passes by 
brings the Hamas closer to adopting Hizbullah's model.  If the IDF 
tries to enter the Gaza Strip militarily it will be much more 
difficult then it would have been a few months ago, and if the 
operation is delayed, the mission might truly look like the second 
Lebanon War.... But for the time being the IDF did not get the green 
light from the cabinet for a wide scale operation.  This kind of 
operation will cause lose of lives and massive Qassam fire on 
southern towns, and this is not what Israel needs while the Lebanon 
wounds haven't healed yet.  Israel declared that the war in Lebanon 
was meant to retrieve our deterrence.  As of now the deterrence 
balance is working -- but mainly against us."

¶2.  PM Olmert Visit to Russia: 
------------------------------ 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: "If the US 
and Europe are ready to impose effective sanctions against Teheran 
... and Russia is standing in the way, then the leading democracies 
must not politely take their cards and go home." 
 
Block Quotes: 
------------- 
"Whither Putin?" 
Conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (10/20): 
"Unfortunately, based on Putin's behavior rather than his rhetoric, 
Western nations must assume that the Russian leader is playing such 
a double game.  Accordingly, Israeli and other leaders must start 
asking themselves how long they can publicly give Putin the benefit 
of the doubt and pretend that Russia is playing a constructive 
rather than highly obstructionist role.  Russia must be judged by 
its actions.  If the US and Europe are ready to impose effective 
sanctions against Teheran ... and Russia is standing in the way, 
then the leading democracies must not politely take their cards and 
go home.... If Russia wants to be considered part of the West, these 
times demand joining our side, not protesting our common enemies."
