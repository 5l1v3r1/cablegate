¶1. (U) Ambassador Bailey and Canadian Ambassador Poulin 
jointly delivered ref A invitation to Latvian MOD Slakteris 
July 5.  Slakteris pledged to send a representative to the 
conference in Budapest, but given the minister's trip to 
Washington the following week, it might be at a rather low 
level.  DATT passed ref B information to the ministry on 
July 7, but the GOL has not yet identified its participant. 
 
¶2. (U) Comment: The MOD is stretched thin with planning for 
the NATO Summit and the minister's trip to Washington, and 
normal summer leave reducing the number of available bodies 
to send.  We will provide attendee information when 
available.
