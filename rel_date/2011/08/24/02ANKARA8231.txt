Post delivered Ref A materials to MFA Head of the Environment 
Department Asli Oral on November 7. Oral advised that the 
government of Turkey shares most of our views in the 
non-paper, accepts the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation 
(JPOI), and is also pleased with the outcome of the World 
Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). MFA is currently 
awaiting specific input on the non-paper's six key issues 
from other Turkish ministries. After we receive GOT's 
assessment, we will forward to Department.
