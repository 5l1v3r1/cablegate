SUBJECT: UNAMA HEAD ASKS OSCE TO STRENGTHEN ELECTION SUPPORT 
 
REF: KABUL 1044 
 
¶1. This is an action request.  See paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  Kai Eide, Special Representative of the UN Secretary 
General (SRSG) to the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan 
(UNAMA), has sent a letter on May 27, requesting that the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) 
strengthen its election support team.  Embassy received a 
copy of the letter, which is reprinted in full in paragraph 
¶2.  The OSCE has announced it will send a working-level 
technical support team, which would focus on thematic areas 
(reftel), rather than observers.  This represents a decreased 
contribution compared to the 2004 and 2005 elections, when 
OSCE provided observer missions. 
 
¶3. Comment and action request:  Ambassador Eide has asked all 
members of the international donor community support this 
matter through their diplomatic representatives in Vienna. 
In addition, he has specifically asked the United States to 
support his efforts through a letter from Ambassador 
Holbrooke to the OSCE.  We recommend the U.S. join in 
supporting Eide's request.  Not only would beefing up the 
OSCE technical mission be very helpful in strengthening the 
IEC's technical capacity, getting an OSCE observer mission 
would be an important addition to what is shaping up to be a 
far from robust international observer presence.

Her Excellency Ambassador Mara Marinaki 
Chairperson of the OSCE Permanent Council 
Permanent Representative of Greece to the OSCE 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe

Dear Ambassador Marinaki, 
 
     Following PC.DEC/891 of 30 March 2009 and the OSCE/ODIHR 
- European Union Exploratory Mission to 
Afghanistan from 14-27 April 2009, ODIHR provided its finding 
and initial planning for an Election Support Team (EST) to 
Afghanistan for the Presidential and Provincial Council 
elections scheduled for 20 August 2009 (CIO.GAL/62/09) 
 
     UN Security Council resolution 1986 (2009) underscores 
the importance of the upcoming presidential and provincial 
council elections to Afghanistan's democratic development and 
calls for all efforts to be made to ensure the credibility, 
safety and security of the elections and for members of the 
international community to provide the necessary assistance. 
In addition, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic 
Republic of Afghanistan Dr. Rangin Dadfar Spanta, in a letter 
to the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office of 22 February 2009, 
invited the OSCE to support the elections.  Afghanistan, as a 
Partner for Co-ooperation of the OSCE, has an important 
impact on the neighbouring regions of the OSCE.  Ensuring the 
credibility 
of the 2009 elections is in the interest of the entire 
international community. 
 
     I would first like to thank your organization for its 
constant support to improving election processes in 
Afghanistan.  The last two OSCE advisory missions sent in 
2004 and 2005 played a very constructive role in identifying 
weaknesses and proposing ways to strengthen the elections. 
 
     As you know these elections will be the first organized 
entirely by the Afghan authorities.  The United Nations are 
however providing substantial assistance. Technical 
preparations for the elections are proceeding well despite 
challenging circumstances.  Recent exercises such as voter 
registration and candidate nomination were conducted 
successfully and with minimal security incidents.  These 
exercises have also shown that there is strong interest 
amongst Afghans to participate in these elections. 
 
     Considering all the above, I was concerned to learn that 
ODIHR's recommendation for a OSCE's Electoral Support Team to 
Afghanistan in 2009 falls short of OSCE's support for 
previous Afghan elections in 2004 and 2005.  According to 
 
KABUL 00001399  002 OF 002 
 
 
ODIHR's initial planning, the Electoral Support Team for 2009 
shall comprise twelve individuals which are to be based on 
Kabul and may conduct visits to the Provinces.  In 
2005, the OSCE's Election Support Team comprised some 32 
individuals, sixteen of whom deployed to the field, providing 
additional ears and eyes on the ground and useful insights on 
how to improve the electoral process.  The OSCE's election 
expertise is universally recognized:  your Election Support 
Teams for the 2004 and 2005 elections contributed 
substantially to strengthening the credibility of the 
electoral process. 
 
    Ideally, the OSCE's contribution should be complementary 
to activities of other international actors.  In this 
context, we appreciate the proposed focus on recommendations 
to facilitate long term institution 
building. 
 
     With due consideration to the challenges at hand, I 
would like to encourage you to reexamine the possibility of 
having a more robust OSCE contribution to the 2009 elections, 
including some presence at regional level. 
 
     Specifically, I would like to suggest the following 
concrete areas for additional OSCE support: 
 
     1) In the area of Domestic Observation, the OSCE could 
provide experts to advise FEFA on strengthening their 
capacity for gathering information and data compilation, 
thereby improving accuracy and integrity. 
 
     2) The results process is substantially different from 
prior elections, and will attract much scrutiny.  Even with a 
limited presence at the regional level, OSCE experts could 
consider paying special attention to the count and tabulation 
procedure, including if feasible sampling of counts outside 
of Kabul. 
 
     3) In the area of Voter Registration, an independent 
assessment regarding longer term options for a combined civil 
and voter registry to be incorporated into operational 
planning for 2010 would be useful. 
 
     4) While 2010 planning for Capacity Building and support 
for the government is underway, OSCE experts could 
participate in a donors' group on broader issues of capacity 
building. 
 
     5) Finally, I suggest that one OSCE expert be embedded 
in each of the eight IEC Regional Centers, depending on the 
security situation, to gain a broader, national perspective 
and insight into all aspects of the process, and to interact 
directly with a variety of stakeholders, including domestic 
observers and candidate agents. 
 
     A strong female component within the OSCE contribution, 
as in previous years, including in leadership positions, 
would be most welcome. 
 
     Let me assure you that UNAMA is fully engaged in 
providing assistance and support to the 2009 Presidential and 
Provincial Council elections in Afghanistan.  Over and above 
that engagement, we also need the support of other relevant 
institutions in ensuring, by joining efforts, that these 
elections meet Afghan expectations and aspirations. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
 
Kai Eide 
Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in 
Afghanistan
