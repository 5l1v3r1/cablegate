REF: STATE 105173 
 
We delivered reftel demarche on October 6 to Ahmed Saadi, 
Acting Deputy Director of Multilateral Affairs, at the MFA. 
Saadi usually covers human rights, but was covering the 
sanctions portfolio for a colleague currently in New York at 
the UNGA meetings, thus he said he was not able to respond 
substantively to our request.  He stated that he would relay 
the demarche to his colleagues in New York.
