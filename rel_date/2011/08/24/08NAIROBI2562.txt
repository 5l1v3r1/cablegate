Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  Somali contacts expressed deep admiration for the United 
States in the aftermath of the November 5 U.S. election.  A 
wide range of Somalia Unit contacts called and wrote to 
congratulate the United States on a peaceful and historic 
election.  Contacts' comments ranged from statements of 
esteem for the United States' having voted on the two 
candidates' qualifications rather than ethnicity to hope that 
Somalia could likewise overcome years of adverse conditions 
to end the 18-year conflict in their own country.  End 
summary.

Historic Election, A Sign That All Things Are Possible

¶2.  The Somalia Unit received a wide range of positive 
messages and calls in the aftermath of President-elect 
Obama's November 5 electoral win.  Many messages, including 
Lul Sharmarke, Director of HornAfrik Radio, simply praised 
the fact that the American people were once again able to 
conduct a peaceful election, unlike Somalia, in which the 
citizens exercised their right to choose a leader.  A contact 
with the Coalition of Grassroots Women's Organizations 
(COGWO) reported women in Mogadishu weeping. 
 
¶3.  A Somali businessman in Nairobi was among those who wrote 
to congratulate the American people on making "remarkable and 
unforgettable history" in electing an African-American 
president.  On the same note, Sharif Hassan Sheikh and 
Professor Abdurahman Ibbi of the Alliance for the 
Re-Liberation of Somalia congratulated the American people 
for voting on the qualifications of the person, contrasting 
that with Somalia's practice of basing all elections on the 
4.5 formula.  (Note: This formula balances representation of 
Somalia's four main clans with its minority clans.  End 
note.)  Other contacts cited the election as a "demonstration 
of true democracy" and an example of putting one's country 
ahead of the individual. 
 
¶4.  Still other contacts noted that if the United States, 
which they maintain is far less homogeneous than Somalia, can 
overcome decades of racial discord, Somalia should be able to 
overcome decades of violent conflict.  The Transitional 
Federal Government's Deputy Prime Minster, Ahmed Abdisalam 
Aden, told us America's vote showed us "all things are 
possible." 
 
¶5.  Comment: The unsolicited and emotionally-charged comments 
from our contacts were interesting and useful demonstrations 
of the hopes they have for their country.  We also found 
their unsolicited comments to be yet another example of the 
vigor with which Somalis track events beyond their borders. 
End comment.
