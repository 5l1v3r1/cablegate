SUBJECT: RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH REACHES OUT TO ST PETERSBURG'S 
YOUTH 
 
¶1. (SBU) Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill addressed an audience 
of over 8,000 students at the Ice Palace Stadium in St. 
Petersburg on May 29, the second in a series of large-scale 
appearances made recently by the Patriarch.  The Patriarch's 
hour-long address struck a very Western tone and at times seemed 
to contradict his general message about the basic 
incompatibility between Russia's national values and those of 
the West.  Interestingly, he both began and concluded his speech 
with Martin Luther King's immortal phrase "I have a dream!" and 
devoted much of his address to the individual pursuit of 
happiness.  However, his address was not purely upbeat and 
secular.  He continued to warn young people about the modern 
world's many dangers, such as drugs and alcohol.  He also 
emphasized the uniqueness of Orthodox Christianity, which he 
asserted affords the faithful a direct line to God. 
 
¶2. (SBU) After his speech, Kirill held a brief question and 
answer session with his audience.  In response to a question 
regarding the Orthodox Church's support of the current 
government, Kirill stated that the government's attitudes and 
ideology correspond closely to the interests of the Church.  He 
also said that as the government's actions defend Russia's 
national interests, they were therefore, a priori, the correct 
actions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment.  The new Patriarch obviously feels very 
comfortable in "the modern world" away from the churches and 
monasteries - he drives a motorcycle, regularly uses the 
internet, and has increasingly found a common language to 
communicate with Russia's youth.  Kirill's youth rallies, along 
with the rebranding of the Patriarchy into something more 
youthful and modern (and fully synchronized with the current 
Russian government's policies), demonstrates not only an 
increasingly aggressive campaign to improve the Church's public 
image, but also the evolving symbiosis between the ideologies of 
the Orthodox Church and the Russian government.  Many people 
welcomed his fresh approach and embrace of Russia's young 
people.  End Comment.
