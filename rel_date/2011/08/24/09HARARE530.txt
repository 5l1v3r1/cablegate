¶1.  INTRODUCTION:  From April through June numerous crop production 
and household vulnerability assessments were carried out in Zimbabwe 
to determine potential food deficits and potential food aid needs. 
Five surveys have been released, though two still need to be 
approved by the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA).  These surveys 
provide estimates of the food assistance requirements for0QOX,Qf&J?ION.

SECOND ROUND CROP ASSESSMENTS (AGRITEX)

¶2.  Second Round Crop Assessments (AGRITEX).   This report states 
that there were approximately 1.5 million HA planted with a maize 
yield of 0.8 tons/HA, yielding 1.2 million MT plus an additional 
269,000 MT of small grains.  This would leave a country deficit of 
approximately 470,000 MT. This is much better than last year, 
although still much lower than the traditional average.  AGRITEX's 
2008/2009 estimate of 0.8 tons/HA is three times higher than it was 
last year during the 2007/2008 season.

¶3.  USDA's 2009 Zimbabwe Crop Assessment was released on June 2. 
Utilizing satellite imagery and field work alongside USAID/Zimbabwe 
employees, the USDA crop assessment for the 2008/2009 season states 
that the government's AGRITEX crop assessments appear to be rather 
optimistic.  The USDA survey states that 1,144,000 HA of maize was 
planted with a yield estimated at 0.44 tons/HA.  USDA has taken into 
account the drastic shortages of inputs suQ
