(SBU) EconOff delivered Reftel names of interest to Minister 
Plenipotentiary Driss Ben Fares of the Direction of Juridical 
Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation 
(MFA) on August 12.  Ben Fares reiterated the seriousness 
with which Morocco treats questions about terrorism finance, 
and undertook to share the names with Moroccan security 
agencies.  The Government of Morocco frequently finds it 
difficult to accurately identify individuals based on the 
UNSC 1267 listings, Ben Fares commented, but he promised that 
the MFA would share with the Embassy any relevant information 
that Moroccan agencies may be able to develop.
