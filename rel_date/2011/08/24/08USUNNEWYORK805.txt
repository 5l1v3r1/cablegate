 ¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  UN Under-Secretary-General (U/SYG) for 
Field Support Malcorra acknowledged to Ambassador DiCarlo 
that the UN will not be able to meet its goal of 80 percent 
deployment of UNAMID by December.  Malcorra agreed that the 
UN should consider going public with this information.  She 
offered to brief officials in Washington about UNAMID,s 
logistical needs, especially involving airlift, and was open 
to a small, private meeting of UN officials at headquarters 
to coordinate logistical priorities.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.   (SBU) In her first meeting with U/SYG for Field Support 
(DFS) Susana Malcorra, Ambassador DiCarlo reiterated U.S. 
support for DFS and called for acceleration of UNAMID 
deployment. DiCarlo pushed Malcorra to more clearly specify 
UNAMID,s logistical needs, and Malcorra said she was open to 
a small meeting involving relevant UN offices and major donor 
states to agree upon uniform priorities either at the working 
or a more senior level.  She noted that while she views 
member-states as critical stakeholders, this view is not 
widely shared among her UN colleagues. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Malcorra acknowledged that the SYG,s stated goal 
of 80 percent deployment by the end of December could not be 
met and said 60-65 percent is more realistic for 2008 with 80 
percent achievable by the end of the first quarter in 2009. 
DiCarlo encouraged Malcorra to discuss with her UN colleagues 
making this information publicly available, noting that if 
the UN continues to maintain the 80 percent figure publicly, 
the failure to meet this goal in December will undermine the 
mission,s credibility.  Malcorra agreed to pursue this. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Malcorra said she considers the biggest logistical 
priority for UNAMID to be airlift for both Troop Contributing 
Country (TCC) forces and equipment. She clarified that the 
bottleneck of containers at the Port of Sudan has improved. 
Malcorra said helicopters remain a priority to facilitate 
fast movement of troops, with surveillance capability being a 
secondary concern.  Regarding camp construction, she will 
meet with the Ethiopians and Egyptians this week to press for 
light deployment,  i.e. troops being self-sustaining by 
setting up their own camps. Indicating that she appreciates 
the emphasis that the United States attaches to a successful 
UN operation in Darfur, Malcorra offered to travel to 
Washington to brief officials in the executive and 
legislative branches if this would be helpful.
