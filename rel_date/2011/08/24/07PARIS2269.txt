REF: STATE 73691 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Charge raised reftel points on nomination of Robert 
Zoellick as World Bank president with GOF Treasury Director Xavier 
Musca on May 30.  Musca said that France was likely to support the 
nomination, and referred to remarks made by Foreign Minister Bernard 
Kouchner earlier in the day on the margins of the G8 foreign 
ministers meeting in Potsdam.  Reuters quoted Kouchner as saying 
"certainly" in response to a question on whether Zoellick was the 
right man for the job. 
 
¶2. (SBU) MFA DAS-equivalent for International Financial Affairs 
Cyrille Pierre told us separately that the press had slightly 
misinterpreted Kouchner.  The Foreign Minister (as subsequently 
clarified by an MFA spokesperson) had said that "if Zoellick is 
nominated, I wish him the best of luck."  Pierre said that pending 
the formal announcement the MFA was sensitive about not getting out 
in front of internal USG deliberations.   Pierre said that France 
had a favorable view of Zoellick and said it would be important that 
the nominating and approval process moved forward in a completely 
transparent fashion to ensure buy-in from all stakeholders.
