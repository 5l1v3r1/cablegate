SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT -- DR. MICHAEL SWANGO CASE 
 
¶1.   THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED DAILY 'THE CHRONICLE' 
    DEDICATED ITS AUGUST 15 EDITORIAL TO A CALL FOR THE 
    EXTRADITION OF AMCIT DR. MICHAEL SWANGO, NOW SERVING LIFE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

    SENTENCE IN COLORADO FOR KILLING PATIENTS IN THE UNITED 
    STATES.  SWANGO IS WANTED ON SIMILAR CHARGES IN ZIMBABWE. 
    UNDER HEADLINE "SWANGO SHOULD FACE MUSIC IN ZIMBABWE," THE 
    PAPER COMMENTS: 
 
¶2.   "THE MBERENGWA COMMUNITY DESERVES RESPECT, 
    ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT FOR THE VALIANT EFFORT IT IS 
    MAKING IN TRYING TO PICK UP THE PIECES AND COME TO 
    TERMS WITH THE UNSPEAKABLE HORRORS PERPETRATED BY 
    AMERICAN SERIAL KILLER, DR. MICHAEL SWANGO, DURING A 
    THREE-MONTH SOJOURN.  THE FULL EXTENT OF THE PERVERSE 
    ACTIVITIES OF DR. SWANGO, WHO LEFT A TRAIL OF DEATHS AT 
    MNENE HOSPITAL, UNITED BULAWAYO HOSPITALS AND MPILO 
    HOSPITAL, MAY NOT BE KNOWN FULLY.  HOWEVER, MBERENGWA, 
    WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS BASED FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS, 
    BORE THE BRUNT OF HIS CALLOUS DISREGARD FOR THE 
    SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE.  THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO 
    HAVE BECOME ORPHANS AFTER LOSING PARENTS AT THE HANDS 
    OF THE CRUEL DOCTOR COULD PROVE TO BE THE MOST ACCURATE 
    BAROMETER OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DESTRUCTION AND 
    ANGUISH HE CAUSED. . .WHAT THE BEREAVED FAMILIES, THE 
    COMMUNITY AND THE NATION NEEDS, TO BRING CLOSURE TO 
    THIS SHOCKING AND TRAUMATIC EPISODE IS TO HAVE DR. 
    SWANGO FACE THE FULL WRATH OF THE LAW ON ZIMBABWE SOIL. 
    . .THE U. S. ITSELF HAS MADE A POINT OF ENSURING THAT 
    SUSPECTS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING CRIMES AFFECTING ITS 
    CITIZENS OR ASSETS ARE TRIED ON AMERICAN SOIL.  THE 
    TRIAL OF THOSE ACCUSED OF BOMBING THE U. S. EMBASSIES 
    IN KENYA AND TANZANIA IS A CASE IN POINT.  WE THEREFORE 
    CALL ON THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES NOT TO ABANDON 
    ATTEMPTS TO BRING THE SERIAL KILLER BACK TO FACE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED
