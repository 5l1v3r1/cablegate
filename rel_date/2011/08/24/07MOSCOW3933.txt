¶1.  (SBU) Reftel requested that Embassy gather information on an 
Accounting Chamber audit of Asati that stemmed from money laundering 
allegations made by a former joint owner of the company.  Embassy 
has been unable to obtain either information or even confirmation of 
such an audit.  Embassy believes that the Accounting Chamber would 
provide confirmation of an audit with the submission of a formal 
request for information.  Embassy is prepared to coordinate the 
drafting and delivery of this letter on OPIC's behalf. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Embassy point of contact for this matter is Clayton Hays, 
who can be reached at hayscp@state.gov, by phone at +7 (495) 
728-5022, or by fax at +7 (495) 728-5154.
