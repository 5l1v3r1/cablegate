REF: STATE 57035 
 
Poloff delivered an advance copy of the the Secretary,s 
letter on the Human Rights Council, as well as accompanying 
talking points, to Spanish MFA Human Rights Director Fernado 
Fernandez Arias on April 11.  Arias undertook to convey the 
letter immediately to the Foreign Minister (a copy under 
cover of a note from the Ambassador, with accompanying 
Spanish translation, to follow.)  As a preliminary response, 
Arias said that, like the US, Spain did not intend to put 
forth its candidacy now for the Human Rights Council, but 
would launch a campaign for membership in the 2008 Council 
elections, noting the importance of Spanish membership on the 
Council during Spain,s EU Presidency in the first have of 
Â¶2010.  (As an EU member, Spain has already pledged against 
voting for states subject to UN Security Council sanctions 
for human rights abuses, and against those states with a 
record of systematic human rights violations.)
