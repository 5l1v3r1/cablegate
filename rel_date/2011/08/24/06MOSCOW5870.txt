¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Ambassador met May 26 with Federation 
Council Deputy Speaker Dmitriy Mezentsev to discuss 
interparliamentary relations and cooperation.  Mezentsev 
extended invitations for U.S. participation in the 4th Baikal 
Economic Forum to be held in Irkutsk in September 2006 and 
the 15th Conference of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum 
to be held in Moscow in January 2007.  He also requested that 
the Ambassador encourage U.S. congressional participation in 
the September 16-17 meeting of heads of G-8 lower houses of 
parliament in St. Petersburg and proposed a similar meeting 
of heads of G-8 upper houses of parliament in February/March 
¶2007.  END SUMMARY. 
. 
U.S. PARTICIPATION IN FOURTH BAIKAL ECONOMIC FORUM 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mezentsev invited the Ambassador and others on 
behalf of Irkutsk Governor Aleksandr Tishanin and himself to 
the 4th Baikal Economic Forum, which is scheduled for 
September 16-17, 2006.  Noting that the U.S. did not send a 
delegation to the previous forum, he expressed hope that this 
time representatives from business, Congress, and U.S. 
government agencies would participate.  Mezentsev said South 
Korea, Mongolia, China, Japan, Indonesia, and some European 
countries had been invited, but a U.S. presence would raise 
the profile and significance of the forum.  He added that the 
forum will address development of Russia's economic and 
social spheres, especially in Siberia and the Far East, as 
well as development of international and interparliamentary 
cooperation.  The Ambassador responded that he was planning 
to travel to Irkutsk about 10 days before the forum but would 
re-examine his schedule, assuring Mezentsev that he would 
push for a strong American delegation to attend.  He agreed 
that highlighting the potential of Siberia and the Far East 
was important for both countries. 
. 
INVITATION TO 15TH ASIA-PACIFIC PARLIAMENTARY FORUM 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mezentsev also mentioned he would like to invite 
Senator Frist to represent the U.S. at the 15th Conference of 
the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum (APPF) in January 2007, 
as well as to have separate meetings with the Federation 
Council.  He stressed that hosting the forum was a major 
event for Russia and that it was important for the USG to 
support it.  He said Putin himself would meet with forum 
delegates and host a dinner.  In addition to widening 
interparliamentary contacts, the U.S. delegation would be 
able to discuss bilateral issues and take part in a public 
discussion of U.S.-Russia relations and other international 
affairs at the Center for Strategic Research. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mezentsev said that proposals regarding agenda items 
and draft resolutions would be submitted by participants in 
June/July.  He expected the final agenda would correlate with 
the G-8 Summit agenda and focus on issues like energy 
security, transport logistics, and the fight against global 
terrorism and HIV/AIDS, as well as take into account 
proposals from the previous forum in Jakarta. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Ambassador responded that he would be happy to 
support the APPF and agreed that it would be a good idea to 
take advantage of a U.S. delegation visit for more than one 
purpose.  He emphasized that during this period of 
frustration and doubt on both sides of the U.S.-Russia 
relationship, it was all the more important to work together; 
legislatures had an important role to play in that process. 
He said he would do everything possible to work with Congress 
to encourage a delegation to come.  The Ambassador encouraged 
Mezentsev to take advantage of Senator Lott's July visit to 
Moscow to discuss the forum directly with him. 
. 
PROPOSED MEETING OF G-8 UPPER HEADS OF PARLIAMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Mezentsev proposed that a meeting of G-8 heads of 
upper houses of parliament take place in February/March 2007 
-- similar in structure to the September 16-17 meeting of the 
G-8 heads of lower houses of parliament -- and expressed his 
hope for a strong U.S. presence.   He said the meeting would 
be conducted in plenary session for discussions of issues of 
common interest to G-8 countries, as well as separate 
meetings on bilateral issues.  The Ambassador responded that 
he would be glad to convey Mezentsev's interest in a meeting 
of upper house heads in February/March 2007.  He repeated 
that Mezentsev should take advantage of Senator Lott's July 
visit to Moscow to talk about these issues face-to-face.
