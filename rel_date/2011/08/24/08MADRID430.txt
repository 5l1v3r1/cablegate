¶1. AmCit Dugan Rosalini's Barcelona lawyer, David Aineto 
Trabal (of the firm AEQIO ADVOCATS), told the Embassy on 
4/13/08 that the Spanish private party involved in the case 
has decided not to press criminal charges against Rosalini. 
According to the lawyer, the possibility that Rosalini could 
be subject to a criminal prosecution has ended "forever." 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶2. This is obviously a positive development.  Hopefully, the 
parties are also closer to settling with respect to the 
execution of the Cook County, Illinois judgment award to 
Dugan Rosalini.
