(SBU)   During a May 6 meeting between Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York Senior Vice President Gerard Dages and Arab 
Monetary Fund (AMF) Director General Jassim Al-Mannai, 
Econchief had the opportunity to ask Dr. Mannai for his 
impressions on the May 3 Iraq Compact signing ceremony. 
Al-Mannai said that he thought the meeting was "useful" and 
that the Iraqis had made "good presentations."  He noted that 
he had made remarks confirming the AMF's support for Iraq. 
In response to Econchief's question about the status of Iraqi 
negotiations on arrears to the AMF, Al-Mannai said that the 
talks were making good progress.  He said that Iraqi Central 
Bank Governor Shabibi had confirmed that a "green light" had 
been given to solve the arrears "ASAP."  Al-Mannai added that 
a resolution would allow the Iraqis to again tap the AMF's 
resources.
