¶1. Poloff delivered points in reftel a to MFA Deputy Assistant 
Minister for American Affairs Amin Malaeka on Jan 20, emphasizing 
the need for contributions to be registered with the United Nations 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA). 
Malaeka took the points, and noted the GOE would most likely send 
medicine and medical supplies, but said cash assistance was 
unlikely. 
 
 
 
¶2.  On Jan 21 MFA Cabinet Advisor for Latin American Affairs Walid 
Haggag advised poloff that the Egyptians were planning to convene 
an interagency coordination group to determine Egypt's humanitarian 
response to the earthquake in Haiti.  The interagency would include 
the MFA, the Prime Minister's office, the Red Crescent, and the 
Ministry of Social Solidarity.  Haggag said the GOE planned to send 
LE 500,000 in medicine and medical supplies, but needed to finalize 
details, including how to move the supplies. 
 
 
 
¶3. Haggag noted there are 28 Egyptian policemen in Haiti serving in 
the U.N.'s Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH); they suffered 
no casualties from the earthquake.  He said the GOE had not decided 
whether or not to increase the Egyptian complement of police, 
and/or send soldiers, following the recent passage of UNSCR 1908.
