SUBJECT: DEMARCHE TO AUSTRIA ON DEBT RELIEF -- 
INTERNATIONAL COMPACT WITH IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 181094 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Charge delivered reftel demarche on November 6 to 
Ralph Scheide, the Austrian MFA's Director for the Middle 
East and Africa.  Charge especially urged that Austria 
forgive the remaining 20 percent of Iraq's debt. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Scheide noted that Austria's forgiveness of 80 
percent of Iraq's debt had represented debt relief amounting 
to approximately one percent of Austria's GDP.  He said it 
would be extremely difficult for Austria to forgive more 
debt, or to provide a grant in the amount of remaining debt. 
He reported that Iraq expenditures were taking a large share 
of Austria's available development funds, leaving Austrian 
development authorities with very little discretion to fund 
priorities elsewhere.  (Note:  As government coalition talks 
enter their second month, the federal government cannot pass 
a new budget.  In each month, it can only spend one-twefth 
of the previous year's budget.  This leaves ery little room 
for major new initiatives.  End note.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) However, Scheide said that if th Paris Club 
discussed further debt relief for Irq, Austria would 
naturally consider the issue agin in that cotext. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Post will continu to press this point with 
Austrian officials.
