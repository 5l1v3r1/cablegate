(SBU) Ireland remains in agreement with U.S. positions on the 
Iranian nuclear issue, according to Therese Healy, Department 
of Foreign Affairs (DFA) First Secretary for Disarmament and 
Nonproliferation, to whom Post delivered ref A and B 
demarches on February 1 and 10, respectively.  Reiterating 
comments in ref C, Healy said that Ireland fully supported 
the IAEA's referral of Iran to the UNSC, a move that, she 
believed, would reinforce the IAEA's credibility and 
authority.  She conveyed the GOI's hope that P-5 Members 
would maintain a consensus approach, and she noted the GOI's 
interest in the scheduled February 16 talks between Russia 
and Iran on alternative arrangements for uranium enrichment. 
She observed, however, that the DFA had received reporting 
through EU channels that Russia was pessimistic about the 
talks' chances of success.  Healy added that the DFA looked 
forward to further communication with the USG as the March 6 
meeting of the IAEA Board approached.
