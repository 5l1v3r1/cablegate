¶1.  (U) Recent press reports indicate that the GOE is planning to 
amend the 2002 Anti-Money Laundering (AML) law to re-enforce the 
authority of the Central Bank's Money Laundering Combating Unit 
(MLCU) to handling economic and financial crimes connected to 
terrorist finance or threatening the national economy.  Econoff 
spoke to Samir Shehad, Director of the MLCU, who said that the 
amendments were designed to bring Egypt's AML law into greater 
conformity with the 41 general recommendations and 9 special 
anti-terrorist financing recommendations of the Financial Action 
Task Force. 
 
¶2.  (U) According to Shehad, the main focus of the amendments is to 
expand the predicate crimes covered by the AML law to include, inter 
alia, tax evasion, embezzlement, insider trading, bribery, trade in 
human beings, fraud, forgery and environmental crimes related to 
hazardous materials or waste.  Individuals found guilty of tax 
evasion, illegal profit-making or insider trading will be subject to 
Article 14 of the AML which mandates a maximum of 7 years 
imprisonment, a fine commensurate with the severity of the crime, 
and confiscation of the illegal funds.  The new amendments will also 
strengthen the MLCU's authority vis-a-vis banks and financial 
institutions by requiring accounting firms, law offices, real estate 
brokers, gold shops and casinos to report suspicious transactions to 
the MLCU.  In addition, the amendments will expand the definition of 
"cash" to include negotiable instruments in the case of cash 
couriers. 
 
¶3.  (U) Shehad noted that the amendments were drafted by a technical 
team including lawyers and prosecutors from the Ministry of Justice 
and officials from the Central Bank and financial regulatory 
agencies.  The draft amendments are currently under consideration by 
the Cabinet of Ministers.  Shehad hoped the amendments would be 
passed in the next session of parliament, which begins in November. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  When asked about the timing of these amendments, 
Shehad became somewhat defensive, asking "Why all the questions?" 
In past bilateral discussions on Egypt's AML efforts, GOE officials 
generally maintain that both the AML law and the GOE's enforcement 
efforts have been adequate to address the relatively low money 
laundering risk in Egypt.  The amendments to the AML law may be a 
genuine effort to bring Egypt's laws up to international standards, 
but it is noteworthy that the GOE is now addressing deficiencies in 
its AML law, just as several members of the banned Muslim 
Brotherhood are on trial in military courts for alleged money 
laundering.
