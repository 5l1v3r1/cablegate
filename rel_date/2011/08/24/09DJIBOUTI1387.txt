SUBJECT: SUDAN PARTIES A NO-SHOW AT IGAD MINISTERIAL 
 
REF: 09 KHARTOUM 1376 
 
1.(SBU)  Summary:  The Dec. 7-8 IGAD Ministerial Council meeting 
opted not to discuss Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) 
implementation, after senior Sudanese representatives from the 
National Congress Party (NCP) and Sudan Peoples' Liberation 
Movement (SPLM) failed to attend.  Instead, the Council mandated 
the Kenyan and Ethiopian Foreign Ministers to travel "soon" to 
Khartoum and Juba to "talk to the parties heart to heart" and 
report back to the IGAD Council.  End summary. 
 
 
 
2.(SBU)  Senior Sudanese representatives failed to turn up for the 
Dec. 7-8 IGAD Ministerial meeting in Djibouti, leaving their 
Ambassador to Djibouti to head the delegation, apparently without 
instructions.  Consequently, the detailed discussion of CPA 
implementation that was to be a centerpiece of the IGAD meeting did 
not occur. 
 
 
 
3.(SBU)  In brief comments at the conclusion of the meeting, 
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin, in his capacity as IGAD 
Council Chair, insisted that the absence of senior Sudanese 
representatives was for "only technical reasons" (related to travel 
arrangements).  The report of the IGAD Special Envoy for Sudan was 
submitted to the working-level IGAD Committee of Experts, Seyoum 
said, but the Council of Ministers declined to consider the report 
in the absence of Sudanese delegations from the NCP and SPLM. 
 
 
 
4.(SBU)  Seyoum said that the Council had mandated him and Kenyan 
Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula to travel to Juba and Khartoum 
"soon" to "talk to the parties heart to heart" and report back to 
the Council.  Seyoum stressed that "whatever happens in Sudan is 
bound to affect us all."  He thanked international partners - 
"especially the United States and Special Envoy Gration who is 
actively involved in assisting the parties" to implement the CPA. 
IGAD support was instrumental in negotiation of the CPA and will 
remain "vital for follow-up and implementation" of the agreement. 
 
 
 
5.(SBU)  Comment:  Despite widespread rumors that the absence of 
NCP and SPLM delegations was due to the recent spike in political 
tensions in Sudan (reftel), the IGAD ministers avoided any comment 
on these matters and Seyoum took pains to ascribe the absence to 
mere "technical" factors.
