Â¶2006.  Please note that Turkish press reports often contain

POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
EKSPRES / BOLGE / SABAH (GUNEY) / EVRENSEL:     Eric Green, the 
U.S. Consul in Adana, paid a courtesy call to the Governor 
Adana.  When asked by journalists during this visit about 
transportation of materiel from Incirlik airbase to the NATO 
port in Mersin's Silifke district, Mr. Green said that it was a 
routine process as far as he knew.  Journalists further asked 
Consul Green on recent media reports about whether the U.S. 
would appoint a special representative to coordinate the steps 
that will be taken in countering the PKK.  Green said they were 
waiting a clarification from Wahington about that and that he 
had no further comments on the issue.  Mr. Green said that the 
Consulate and the Governor's Office had always enjoyed 
continuous warm relationships and expressed his gratefulness to 
the Turkish authorities for the assistance they provided during 
the evacuation of U.S. citizens from Lebanon. 
 
EKSPRES:        The U.S. authorities at Incirlik Air Base said that 
the materiel transported from the base was unusable military 
materiel derived from a routine inventory check made biennially. 
 The materiel will reportedly be sent to the U.S. via a military 
vessel that will arrive at the NATO port on August 15. 
 
BOLGE / EKSPRES / EVRENSEL / YENI SAFAK:        The dailies reported 
that another fleet of trucks carried materiel from Incirlik Air 
Base to the port in Mersin.  Evrensel daily alleges that, since 
Turkey does not allow aircraft carrying military ammunition to 
take off from Incirlik Air Base, such ammunition is being 
allegedly moved by trucks to the port in order to be shipped to 
the Greek side of Cyprus.  Yeni Safak daily reported that the 
U.S. Embassy announced that the trucks dispatched from Incirlik 
were operating in coordination with the Turkish General Staff. 
 
EKSPRES:        Ummuhan Bayram, Chairperson of women's branch of 
Adana's BBP (Grand Unity Party), who said that they were 
boycotting products of Israel and the U.S., made a call to the 
people to do the same.  Bayram said they had collected 5,000 
signatures from women to protest and stop "the massacre Israel 
carried out against people of Lebanon and Palestine." 
 
EVRENSEL:       150 members of EMEP (The Party of Labor) held a 
press announcement in Elazig and protested Israel's Zionism. 
 
EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM:        Istanbul 12th Heavy Penalty Court 
lifted the ban on Ozgur Gundem daily's publication and 
dissemination. The newspaper appeared on shelves back again 
today (see press summary 08/08). 
 
BOLGE / EKSPRES:        Tacidar Seyhan, Adana deputy from CHP, brought 
allegations about the U.S. transporting weapons and war materiel 
from Incirlik Air Base to Israel to the agenda of the Turkish 
Parliament. 
 
BOLGE:  Members of Adana branch of Memur-Sen (Union of Civil 
Servants) staged a protest against Israel's offensive on 
Lebanon. 
 
BOLGE / YENI SAFAK:     Jandarma Intelligence Directorate of 
Hatay's Jandarma Command, upon receiving a tip-off, conducted an 
operation on a Syrian-plated truck that would have travelled to 
Syria via Hatay's Cilvegozu Border Gate.  Jandarma teams found 
74 automatic hunting guns, 227 blank pistols (9mm), and 24,700 
cartridges. 
 
EVRENSEL / OZGUR GUNDEM / HURRIYET:     To prevent DTP (Democratic 
Society Party) from winning to win more seats in the parliament 
in case election threshold gets lowered, AKP officials launched 
fresh efforts to impose a conditional 2 or 3 per cent threshold 
for independent lawmakers.  Despite alleged plans against DTP's 
future representation in the parliament, DTP has been making 
preparations for launching 'Democratic Election Campaign.' 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   CHP Deputy national chairman Onur Oymen said 
that if the U.S. appoints a political representative concerning 
issues about the PKK, Turkey, in the end, would be forced to see 
the PKK as a legitimate interlocutor. 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   Members of the Initiative for Preservation of 
 
ADANA 00000182  002 OF 002 
 
 
Hasankeyf made a call to people to show their reaction against 
the Ilisu Dam Project by sending fax messages and e-mails to the 
Austrian, German and Swiss companies, which are financing the 
project. 
 
YENI SAFAK:     Turkish Armed Forces continues to dispatch military 
units to the districts located near the border area in Hakkari 
to prevent PKK members' infiltrations into the country.
