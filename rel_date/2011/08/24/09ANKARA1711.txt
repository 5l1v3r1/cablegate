 END OF SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. Completed Actions for the Reporting Period: 
 
¶A.  Meetings during the Reporting Period by EXBS Advisory 
Team: 
 
¶1. (U) The EXBS Advisor met with Serhan Yigit, the Head of 
the Arms Control and Disarmament Department, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs to discuss the upgrade of the Turkish 
National Police's hand held Identifinder Isotope Identifiers, 
and the decision on the request to visit the eastern Turkey 
border gates at Gurbulak (on the border with Iran) and Hopa 
(on the border with Georgia).  The DOE's Second Line of 
Defense has proposed a one-for-one exchange of the old device 
for the newer, improved model.  The Turkish National Police 
received 8 of the older units in 2008. Yigit said he will 
discuss with relevant offices about the DOE proposal and also 
advised that the visit to the eastern border customs gates 
could not be approved for the November time frame requested 
and suggested we revisit the request in the Spring. 
 
¶B. Training Conducted During the Period: 
 
1) (U) Twenty-three Turkish government officials attended the 
Department of Energy's, Pacific Northwest National 
Laboratory's Radiation Academy at the HAMMER facility in 
Richland, Washington, November 2-7. The training included 
classroom instruction on nuclear, biological and chemical 
weapons of mass destruction, and instruction on the use of 
fixed and hand held detection devices for identifying and 
interdicting WMD's, radioactive materials, and dual use 
commodities used in the production of radioactive materials, 
nuclear reactors and weapons.  The participants had multiple 
opportunities to use the tools and equipment while working 
through case studies and border detection and interdiction 
scenarios. 
 
2) (U) Eighteen Turkish Customs officers attended the Customs 
and Border Protection's International Border Interdiction 
Training (IBIT) in McAllen, Texas.  The training included 
classroom presentations concerning the methods employed by 
CBP in conducting examinations at the land border, visits to 
the border crossing at Hidalgo and Pharr, Texas, and a 
day-long overview of the U.S. Border Patrol's enforcement 
operations including demonstrations of the equipment and 
assets employed in enforcing the border between the ports of 
entry.In addition to an entire day devoted to CBP's efforts 
in counter terrorism and the prevention of WMD from entering 
the United States, the students participated in two days of 
hands-on observations at the commercial processing port at 
Pharr, Texas and passenger and personal vehicle processing at 
the Port of Hidalgo, Texas. The Turkish Customs officers were 
able to work with the CBP officers using the various tools 
and inspection techniques that had been discussed in the 
classroom, while they performed their inspections of arriving 
traffic.Class critiques were positive, and the comments made 
to the EXBS Team during the week indicated the Turkish 
Customs officers had gained knowledge from the experience 
they would employ when they returned to their respective 
border gates.

¶C. (U) Equipment Delivered During this Period:  None 
 
¶D. (U) Imminent Training or Equipment Status: The EXBS team 
is working with the MFA to obtain authority for the 
Department of Energy's, Second Line of Defense to upgrade the 
IdentiFinder NGH Handheld Digital Spectrometer devices that 
they had provided to Turkish National Police (TNP) in 2008. 
Their intent is to ship new models with the upgrades, and 
then trade them with the GOT for the older models. Because 
the devices are equipped with a radiation source for 
calibration, the equipment trade must be authorized by the 
Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK). 
 
¶E. (U) Significant Developments in Export Controls, 
Nonproliferation, or Related Border Security: None 
 
¶3. (U) Future Activities:  The EXBS Advisor will travel to 
Oman the week of December 3-11 to assist the Regional EXBS 
Office in Muscat and the Royal Omani Police (Customs) in 
developing a Risk Management Targeting training program for 
use in the their Customs Academy.
