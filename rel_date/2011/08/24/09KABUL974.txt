 Polcouns delivered demarche points April 19 to Foreign 
Ministry Senior Advisor Davood Marodian.  Marodian affirmed 
that Afghanistan would vote with enthusiasm for the United 
States, Afghanistan's strategic partner, in our bid for a 
seat on the UN Human Rights Council.  At our suggestion, 
Marodian agreed to instruct Afghanistan's permanent mission 
in New York to contact USUN to coordinate on how best 
Afghanistan could help persuade third countries to support 
our candidacy.
