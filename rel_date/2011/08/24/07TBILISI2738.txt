REF: STATE 148605 
 
¶1. On October 30, Embassy Econ Officer met with David Amaghlobeli, 
vice president and acting president of the National Bank of Georgia 
(Georgia's central bank) and familiarized him with the FATF 
statement and guidelines on Iran transmitted reftel.  Amaghlobeli 
confirmed that the NBG and its financial unit, the Financial 
Monitoring Service, have the responsibility in the Georgian 
government to notify banks of conditions and risks for doing 
business with Iran.   Amaghlobeli said the current level of 
transactions between Georgia and Iran is insignificant and normal 
financial communications are not functional between the two 
countries.  He said that Georgia's Ministry of Finance has 
encountered problems with transferring salaries to the employees of 
Georgia's Embassy in Iran, due to restrictions on money transfers 
that are already in place. 
 
¶2. Nevertheless, given the interest Iran has shown in enhancing 
economic relations with Georgia, Amaghlobeli committed to update all 
commercial banks and financial institutions with the information and 
guidelines delivered by the Embassy so that the banks can employ 
enhanced scrutiny of transactions related to Iran or Iranian 
entities.  In order to ensure the government is fully aware of U.S. 
concerns in this area, we are also providing the information to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance.
