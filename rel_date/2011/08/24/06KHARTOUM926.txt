SUBJECT:  Sudan Scholars Organization Continues 
Defamation Suit Against Charge 
 
REF:  KHARTOUM 636 
 
¶1.  According to local Arabic daily newspaper Akhbar Al- 
Youm, a public prosecutor in Khartoum North continues to 
maintain an active case against Charge Hume for alleged 
insults to Islam and defamation of the Prophet Mohammed. 
The case stems from a written complaint filed by the 
Sudan Scholars Organization in March 2006; the prosecutor 
has completed his investigation and is expected to submit 
a final report to the Ministry of Justice in the near 
future. 
 
¶2.  Comment:  Although the Sudan Scholars Organization is 
a civil society body, its origins and financial support 
rest with the Sudanese government.  As in other Arab 
nations, such groups, often known as the "Sultan's 
Scholars," are available to provide answers in religious 
affairs and order Fatwas as necessary.  Sudan's body is 
composed principally of radical clerics, most of whom 
were educated in Saudi Arabia.  Their following is 
limited, and they do not regard Sudan's Sufi sects as 
real Muslims.  End comment.
