¶1.  (U) On April 24, Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade's spokesman 
El hadji Amadou Sall issued a statement on the Nigerian elections in 
which he appealed for an end to election-related violence and called 
on parties to use the mechanisms provided in the Nigerian 
Constitution to settle disputes.  The statement ended, "As for the 
results, the Government of Senegal will pronounce its views after 
the legal process has been exhausted." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COMMENT: During President Wade's first term, his 
counterparts in the region criticized him for being so outspoken on 
democracy and human rights issues.  For the Senegalese to issue its 
current statement has become unusual and may signal a renewed 
willingness to speak out on continental and world issues.  We must 
also keep in mind that Presidents Wade and Obasanjo have often seen 
one another as diplomatic competitors even if they have successfully 
acted in concert.  END COMMENT.
