SUBJECT: UNGA 61: PRESIDENT-ELECT KHALIFA LAYS OUT HER 
PRIORITIES 
 
 
¶1. (U) On September 11, Ambassadors Bolton and Wallace called 
on incoming President of the General Assembly Haya al Khalifa 
at the Bahraini Mission to the UN.  Khalifa had, just hours 
before, been ceremoniously handed the gavel by outgoing 
President Eliasson in the General Assembly Hall.  Bolton 
assured Khalifa of the U.S.' continued support in the weeks 
and months ahead.  Unlike others in the GA, the U.S. "would 
not get hung up on process," he told Khalifa, "but would 
focus on substance," as she sought to organize the work of 
the upcoming session. 
 
¶2. (U) Khalifa said her top priorities were the 
implementation of the recently passed development resolution 
(A/RES/60/265) and securing agreement on a Comprehensive 
Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT).   On 
development, Khalifa said she would seek to facilitate an 
agreement between donor and recipient nations.  On terrorism, 
she argued that a way could be found to reach agreement on 
the remaining differences, much as Eliasson had found common 
ground to secure a resolution on the Secretary-General's 
counter-terrorism strategy in the final days of the 60th 
Session. 
 
¶3. (U) Pressed by Ambassador Bolton to consider the 
importance of the reform agenda, Khalifa noted her interest 
in further revitalization of the General Assembly and the 
possibility of Security Council reform.  In response to a 
question on mandate review, she said that "mistrust" among 
Member States "poisoned the atmosphere" and led delegations 
to try to keep mandates "even through the substance is 
finished." 
 
¶4. (U) Ambassador Bolton updated Khalifa on the Security 
Council's ongoing effort to recommend a candidate for 
Secretary-General to the General Assembly in sufficient time 
 
SIPDIS 
to allow for a successful transition.  He assured Khalifa of 
continuing close coordination over the coming weeks as 
Council deliberations progressed.
