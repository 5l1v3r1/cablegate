POLITICAL: 
 
EKSPRES / BOLGE:        Kemal Sag, Adana deputy from CHP, criticized 
the remarks made by Necati Cetinkaya, AKP Deputy National 
Chairperson and Elazig deputy, who recently said that the right 
to elect the President was at AKP's discretion and they would 
allow nobody to interfere in their own business.  Sag reportedly 
responded to those remarks by saying that electing the President 
was not an item of intra-party business, but a right that 
belongs to the Turkish Parliament. 
 
EKSPRES:        Abdullah Torun, Adana deputy from AKP, harshly 
criticized the Ankara Bar Association which filed a petition 
with the court to annul the recent decision taken to found a law 
faculty in Adana.  The Ankara Bar Association was reportedly 
regarding the decision to found a law faculty in Adana as a 
political move and based their objection on a shortage of 
faculty members. 
 
SECURITY: 
 
ZAMAN / HURRIYET (CUKUROVA) / BOLGE / EVRENSEL: Jandarma in 
Hatay's Dortyol district opened fire on two persons when they 
reportedly ran away after disobeying jandarma's call to halt. 
One of them died and the other one was wounded.  It was found 
out later that the two persons were working voluntarily as 
village guards.  Meanwhile, a private was wounded during a 
conflict with PKK members in a military operation going on in 
the Amanos Mountain range in Hatay's Hassa district. 
 
ZAMAN:  Terrorists reportedly planted explosives on a 
section of railroad passing nearby a village of Diyarbakir's 
Bismil district.  Security officials noticing the explosives 
safely defused the device and rendered the area safe. 
Meanwhile, security forces patrolling a rural area in Bingol's 
Genc district found terrorists' shelters and ammunition and 
supplies stored in the shelters. 
 
EVRENSEL:       The daily claims that two Sikorsky helicopters that 
took off from Sirnak's Silopi district bombarded the rural 
sections of Zaho in the northern Iraq for three hours the
