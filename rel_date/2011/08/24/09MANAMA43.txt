¶5.  Please consider the following in-country administrative 
notes for Manama, Bahrain: 
 
    a)  VISAS: A visa is required for Bahrain. U.S. 
diplomatic and official passport holders can obtain a gratis 
72-hours or a 7-day visa at the airport immigration 
authority.  If traveler is required to stay longer, the visa 
can be extended.  Significant penalties are charged if the 
visa is not extended prior to expiry.  Visitors staying 
beyond the time limit of the visa should submit their 
passport for visa processing by the Embassy at least two days 
prior to the visa's expiration date. 
 
    b)  LODGING and TRANSPORTATION: Visitors must bring 
adequate funds to cover hotel tariffs and expenses.  Hotels 
accept major credit cards (Amex, Visa, MasterCard).  Embassy 
will arrange for airport expediting and transportation upon 
request. 
 
    c)  BAGGAGE: All luggage is subject to x-ray and hand 
inspection by Bahraini customs officials.  Among items that 
may not be brought into Bahrain are: firearms, large knives, 
swords, videos of any type, and pornography. 
 
    d)  DRESS: Modest dress is more appropriate in Bahrain. 
Both men and women should avoid shorts and sleeveless attire 
in public, although bathing suits and shorts are acceptable 
at hotel facilities. 
 
    e)  PHOTOGRAPHY: Photographing military, religious, and 
government installations is forbidden, and one should ask 
permission before photographing Bahraini Nationals. 
 
    f)  LOCAL TIME: The time difference from Washington D.C. 
is EDT 8 hours.  The official Embassy workweek is Sunday 
through Thursday, 0800 to 1700. 
 
¶6.  Please consider the following in-country threat 
assessment notes for Manama Bahrain: 
 
    a)  Terrorism: After the September 11 terrorist attacks 
in the United States, and the subsequent declaration of a new 
war on terrorism and countries that support it, the need for 
keen situational awareness is more necessary than ever. 
There have been no attacks against either Americans or 
Westerners in general in Bahrain.  However, the current 
regional situation dictates caution.  Visitors must be alert 
to their surroundings and to the possibility of hostile 
surveillance.  Keep hotel rooms locked.  Do not open unlocked 
doors to visitors without verifying who they are.  Vary times 
of departure and arrivals at the hotel and be alert to 
individuals lingering in lobby areas or entrances.  Once 
familiar with the area and routes, take charge in taxis and 
direct the driver to change routes to and from the Embassy. 
Keep windows up and doors locked when traveling in vehicles. 
Report any suspicious activity to the RSO immediately.  Be 
prepared to provide identifying information such as license 
numbers, descriptions, etc.  As tensions are currently 
elevated throughout the region, it is very important for 
visitors to maintain a low profile and avoid confrontations. 
Shirts, jackets, or sweaters covered with Americana are not 
appropriate. 
 
    b)  Crime: Incidents of common crime in Bahrain are very 
low by Western standards.  Unlocked doors, open windows, 
bulging wallets, or purses slung over the back, may invite 
crimes of opportunity.  Common sense precautions that an 
experienced traveler would take in any major metropolitan 
area will suffice in Bahrain. 
 
Americans should note this information when traveling to 
Bahrain.
