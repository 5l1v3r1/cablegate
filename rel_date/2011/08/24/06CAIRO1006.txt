¶1.  (U) NIACT precedence due to urgency of information 
regarding outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in Egyptian 
poultry. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Summary: H5N1 avian influenza has been detected in 
samples from birds from multiple locations in three 
governorates in Egypt.  No human cases have been reported. 
The Ambassador has spoken to the Ministers of Health and 
Agriculture regarding next steps.  Post's ACS section is 
preparing a warden notice.  End summary. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed in multiple 
samples from locations in three governorates in Egypt: Cairo, 
Giza and Minya.  The Cairo and Giza samples were from markets 
and backyard poultry farms.  The Minya sample came from a 
turkey farm that suffered a large die-off of birds earlier 
this week.  The GOE provided samples from these locations to 
the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU-3) in Cairo early 
on February 17.  NAMRU-3 confirmed the samples as H5 shortly 
after receiving them and confirmed H5N1 by 1500 February 17. 
It appears that GOE labs had already determined the presence 
of H5N1 and was using NAMRU, which is the WHO reference lab 
in Cairo, to confirm its findings. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) After learning from NAMRU-3 early February 17 that 
the samples were likely H5N1, the Ambassador spoke to Health 
Minister Dr. Hatem el Gabaly (in New York) and to Minister of 
Agriculture Amin Abaza to learn more about the GOE's planned 
response and to offer support.  Gabaly told the Ambassador 
that he had already informed David Navarro, the AI 
coordinator for the World Health Organization (WHO), of the 
outbreak.  Prime Minister Nazif called a meeting of key GOE 
officials for 1400 February 17. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) ACS is preparing a warden notice for the American 
community in Egypt.  A town meeting for Embassy employees 
will be held Monday, February 20.
