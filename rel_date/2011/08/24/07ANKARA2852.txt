SUBJECT: U.S. COURT RULING BRINGS HEAVY CASH PENALTY TO UZAN FAMILY 
 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: On November 21, Motorola won an appeal in a 
long-standing U.S. fraud case against the Turkish Uzan family, the 
former owners of the Turkish GSM company Telsim.  The U.S. Court of 
Appeals upheld a $1 billion award, which the Uzans had appealed 
claiming they could not afford to pay.  If the Uzans now fail to 
pay, Motorola can request foreign courts to block the family's 
assets anywhere in the world.  While Motorola looks for Uzan assets 
to seize, the Uzan family continues court and arbitration cases 
against the GOT and individual bureaucrats, seeking millions of 
dollars for the allegedly wrongful seizure of its assets in Turkey. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Motorola and Nokia lent nearly $2.5 billion to Telsim 
during the period 1998-2000 when the company was owned by the Uzan 
family.  In 2001, Telsim defaulted on the loan.  In 2004, the 
Turkish State Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF) seized Telsim and all 
Uzan Group companies in an attempt to recoup some of the $6 billion 
the state had to put into the Deposit Fund when it took over the 
Uzans' collapsed Imar Bank.  Motorola persistently fought against 
the Uzans in foreign courts, and won judgments against them in the 
U.S. and U.K. in 2003.  Telsim launched several arbitration cases at 
the Zurich Chamber of Commerce in 2002, prior to the Turkish 
Government's seizure of the company.  The GOT negotiated settlements 
with Nokia and Motorola before the company's sale to Vodafone in 
¶2005.  The SDIF paid $910 million to Motorola after the sale. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second District upheld a 
2006 $1 billion federal court award to Motorola based on a 2002 
fraud suit filed by Motorola and Nokia against the Uzan family.  The 
court rejected the claims made by the Uzans after last year's ruling 
that they could not afford to pay the amount.  The court stated that 
"the family failed to demonstrate that the award exceeds their 
ability to pay." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Motorola now has to collect the judgment.  If the Uzans 
fail to pay, then Motorola can seek to block the family's assets 
anywhere in the world to enforce the judgment, if it can get local 
court approval.  Given that all Uzan family assets in Turkey are 
under state control, Motorola is unlikely to find any assets here. 
The Uzans are thought to have investments in Poland, Jordan and 
Switzerland.  Motorola's co-plaintiff in other court cases against 
the Uzans, Nokia, said in press statements that it would continue to 
pursue court cases against the Uzans for $360 million. 
 
¶5. (SBU) While the U.S.court ruling was good news for Motorola, the 
Uzans continue to pose major problems for the GOT.  They have 
ongoing $40 billion arbitration claims against the government for 
the seizure of their energy companies CEAS and KEPEZ. (Note: The 
GOT's seizure of CEAS and KEPEZ, based on a 2002 regulation relating 
to the Electricity Market Law, was the start of a broad operation 
against the family assets. End Note.)  The Uzans also took the GOT 
to the European Court of Human Rights, claiming the ruling Justice 
and Development Party (AKP) seized its companies to politically 
destroy the Genc ("Youth") Party led by Cem Uzan.  Turkish law 
allows individual bureaucrats to be sued in court for decisions they 
make as government officials, and the Uzans have filed a record 
number of court cases against the high level bureaucrats who were in 
charge when their companies were seized.  The most recent case, 
filed on November 19, claimed $300 million in damages against former 
Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) President Yusuf Gunay.
