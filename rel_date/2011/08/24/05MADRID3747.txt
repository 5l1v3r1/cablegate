REF: A) STATE 189774 
 
According to Ramon Guzman Zapater, Director General for 
International Finance at the Ministry of Economy and Finance, 
EU governments will consider contributing to the Fund for the 
Future through the European Fund for the Mediterranean 
(FEMIP), administered by the EIB.  He thought a contribution 
through FEMIP would be viewed positively (by the Spanish,) 
since the objectives of the Fund for the Future coincide with 
those of FEMIP, but that a contribution would depend on 
majority support by member states.  Spain's contribution to 
the Fund would have to come through the EIB; it will not 
contribute to the Fund bilaterally.  (If the EIB decided 
against participating in the Fund for the Future we could 
revisit this with the Spanish.)
