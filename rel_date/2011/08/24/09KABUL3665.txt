SUBJECT:  ESTABLISHING SENIOR CIVILIAN REPRESENTATIVES IN THE 
REGIONAL COMMANDS NORTH AND WEST 
 
REF:  (A) KABUL 2102; (B) KABUL 2687 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  Ref (A) announced the creation of the Senior Civilian 
Representative (SCR) positions in Regional Command - East (RC-E) and 
Regional Command-South (RC-S), as well as a new structured civilian 
presence throughout Afghanistan, to achieve USG and coalition 
civ-mil unity of effort.  Ref (A) also noted that upon the 
establishment of consulates in Herat and Mazar-e Sharif, the Mission 
would likely dual-hat the Principal Officers (POs) in Herat and 
Mazar as SCRs for RC-W and RC-N.  In anticipation of the stand-up of 
U.S. Consulates in Herat and Mazar in 2010, Embassy Kabul has now 
established dual-hatted SCR/PO positions in both cities.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  As envisioned in Ref (A), Embassy Kabul has established Senior 
Civilian Representative positions in Herat and Mazar, in order to 
strengthen coordination and unity of effort among all U.S. agencies 
within their respective AORs.  The SCRs will be double-hatted as 
Principal Officers (POs).  Post expects to open consulates in both 
cities in 2010, following conclusion of lease negotiations and 
renovations.

CHANGES FOR HERAT 
----------------- 
 
¶3.  PO-Herat will have SCR responsibilities (Ref A) for all 
provinces in RC-W, including Herat, Badghis, Ghor, and Farah. 
Farah, currently part of the RC-S civilian area of responsibility 
(Ref B), will be shifted back to RC-W, in order to ensure unity of 
effort between the SCR and military commander of RC-W.  PO-Herat's 
consular district, or AOR for political, economic, commercial, 
emergency American Citizen Services (ACS) and other consulate 
functions, will include all of RC-W. 
 
¶4.  Once the consulate is established in Herat, the State Department 
rep at the Herat PRT will move to the Consulate. He and other staff 
at the Consulate will assume responsibilities currently performed by 
the State Department rep at the Herat PRT.  Current staffing plans 
for the Consulate include the Principal Officer, two Pol/Econ 
officers, an RSO, two ARSOs, one direct-hire security protective 
specialist, a PAS officer, one Management officer, an Office 
Management Specialist, and an Information Program Officer (IPO). 
Staffing by USAID personnel, including the current USAID rep 
assigned to the PRT, is still under review. 
 
-------------------------- 
CHANGES FOR MAZAR-E SHARIF 
-------------------------- 
 
¶5.  The Principal Officer for Mazar-e Sharif, who will also serve as 
SCR-N, will be responsible for all nine provinces in RC-N:  Faryab, 
Sar-e-Pol, Jowzjan, Balkh, Samangan, Baghlan, Kunduz, Takhar, and 
Badakhshan.  PO Mazar-e Sharif's AOR for political, economic, 
commercial, emergency ACS and other consulate functions will include 
all of RC-N.  Like RC-W, RC-N will shift its personnel from the PRT 
(Mazar-e Sharif) to the consulate.  Consulate personnel will include 
one, possibly two, Pol/Econ officers, an ARSO, a PAS officer, one 
Management officer and an IPO. 
 
¶6.  The Germans (who command RC-N in Mazar) and the Swedes (who run 
PRT Mazar) have both asked that the USG maintain a presence at their 
respective posts.  To that end, USAID anticipates that a development 
advisor would remain at Germany's RC-N, and a Field Program Officer 
would remain at the Swedish PRT.  At the Consulate, USAID hopes to 
establish the position of Senior Development Advisor.  USDA does not 
yet have an officer in Mazar-e Sharif. 
 
¶7.  The PO/SCRs in both Herat and Mazar-e Sharif will report to the 
Ambassador through the Coordinator for Interagency Provincial 
Affairs.  The PO/SCRs will select the lead civilians at each PRT and 
other integrated command teams in their respective AORs, and 
establish appropriate rating and reviewing relationships.
