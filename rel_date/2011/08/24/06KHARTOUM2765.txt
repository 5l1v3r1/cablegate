SUBJECT:  Southern Sudan: Heavy Fighting in Malakal 
 
 
¶1.  Summary:  Fighting erupted in Malakal late on Nov. 28 between 
South Sudan Defense Forces (SSDF) and former SSDF troops aligned 
with the SPLA, resulting in numerous casualties.  Combat intensified 
on Nov. 29, with Sudan Armed Forces elements supporting the SSDF, 
and employing mortars, RPGs, and tanks.  Fighting ended on the 
evening of November 29.  Early reports claim 100 soldiers and an 
unknown number of civilians dead.  The UN evacuated non-emergency 
staff and international NGO staff, including several AmCits; there

Retaliation Effort against Cdr. Tang Sparks Fighting 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2.  According to UN sources, fighting began in Malakal, Upper Nile 
State, on November 28 around 6:15 p.m. when former South Sudan 
Defense Forces troops aligned with the SPLA (SSDF/SPLA) attacked the 
home of SSDF/Fangak commander Gabriel Tang.  The attack may have 
been in retaliation for an attack by Tang's forces last week on the 
home of John Meluit, an SSDF/SPLA commander and 
commissioner-designate for Fangak.  Tang's primary grievance with 
the SPLA is that he was not named commissioner of Fangak.  Several 
other events preceding the fighting, however, are also cited as 
leading to the outbreak of violence.

Escalation - SSDF/SPLA Forces Attack SAF Base 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  During the attack on his home, Tang escaped to a Sudan Armed 
Forces (SAF) base adjacent to the airport.  The UN then evacuated 
Tang on November 28 in hopes that this would defuse the situation; 
it also has plans to evacuate Meluit.  After a lull, the battle 
re-erupted overnight when the SSDF/SPLA forces attacked the SAF 
base.  The heaviest fighting then followed over the next several 
hours involving rocket-propelled grenades, T-55 tanks, mortars, and 
thousands of rounds of rifle ammunition.

--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4.  The situation calmed down on late November 29, and remained so 
on November 30.  The UN appealed to Government of Southern Sudan 
(GoSS) Vice President Riek Machar to intervene for a ceasefire.

Casualty Tolls Hit 100 Dead, 40 Wounded 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  The SAF and SPLA are now reporting 40 hospitalized and 100 dead, 
with totals expected to increase.  The SAF has requested mechanized 
assistance from the UN to begin digging graves.  The UN reports two 
minor injuries to local staff, one of whom was a driver caught in a 
cross-fire.

UN Evacuates Staff, INGO Reps 
----------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The UN initially established three safe-havens for its staff and 
international workers under force protection on November 28.  The UN 
evacuated 242 non-emergency UN, UNMIS, and INGO personnel on 
November 29, with 50 core staff remaining.  Three flights lifted the 
evacuees to Juba, Rumbek, and El Obeid.  On November 29, the UN 
Secretary General expressed concern about the situation, and 
 
SIPDIS 
referred to the hostilities as a serious violation of the security 
arrangements of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.  Furthermore, the 
UN has declared the Malakal area as a Level 3 security zone. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Delegation to Investigate; Ceasefire Violation Cited 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶7.  A Joint Military Delegation comprising high-level officers from 
the SPLA, SAF, and UNMIS arrived in Malakal on November 29 to assess 
the situation.  The UN called a special meeting of the Ceasefire 
Joint Military Commission on November 29.  Participants agreed on 
three points:  a ceasefire violation had occurred, there would be an 
investigation, and those found responsible would be disciplined 
through military proceedings.  The Ceasefire Political Commission 
meeting of November 30 is on hold pending the return of UNMIS Force 
Commander Lt. General Lidder from Malakal (septel).
