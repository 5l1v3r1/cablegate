STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 
------------------- 
¶2. (U) The U.S. listed Gideon Gono, Governor of the Reserve 
Bank of Zimbabwe, in the Annex of Executive Order 13391 on 
November 22, 2005.  In E.O. 13391, the President authorized 
the blocking of all property and interests in property that 
are in the United States of individuals and entities listed 
in the Executive Order's Annex and any person determined by 
the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, to have engaged in actions or policies to 
undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions 
(for the full E.O. text, please see: 
www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/11/2005 1123-4.html). 
 
¶3. (SBU) The United States, and much of the international 
community, have expressed deep concerns about the situation 
in Zimbabwe following the illegitimate election on June 27, in 
which the Mugabe regime used violence and intimidation to 
force opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai - the winner of 
the March 29 election - out of the run-off election and to 
prevent a free and fair election that could reflect the will 
of the Zimbabwean people.  The U.S. is proposing a UN 
Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) with Chapter VII 
measures, including a comprehensive arms embargo on Zimbabwe, 
and an asset freeze and travel ban against individuals and 
entities designated by the Committee as having engaged in or 
having provided support for actions or policies to undermine 
democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, including 
having ordered, planned, or participated in acts of 
politically motivated violence, or as providing support to 
individuals or entities designated.  (Please see reftel for 
full text.)  The UNSCR includes an Annex of individuals to be 
designated immediately upon adoption of the resolution, 
including Gideon GONO.  The Europeans are hesitant to agree 
to GONO's inclusion in the Annex, as the European Union has 
not designated him under the EU Zimbabwe sanctions programs 
(which permits sanctions against individuals who engage in 
activities that seriously undermine democracy, respect for 
human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe).  We strongly 
encourage the EU to list GONO, and request support from 
European governments to maintain GONO's inclusion in the 
Annex for listing at the UN.  There is ample information to 
support Gideon GONO's listing by the EU and the UN.

INFORMATION ON GIDEON GONO 
-------------------------- 
¶4. (U) Please provide the following information to host 
governments: 
 
GONO, Gideon 
DOB 29 Nov 1959 
Passport AD000854 (Zimbabwe) 
Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe 
GONO is responsible for funding repressive state policies. 
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has repeatedly raided foreign 
currency accounts.  Exporting companies and NGOs complain of 
this to the Embassy. 
As Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gono is 
responsible for rampant printing of money that allows the 
government of Zimbabwe to pay its debts ) and which has led 
to an inflation rate currently estimated to be over 1 million 
percent, beggaring the people of Zimbabwe and destroying 
their purchasing power. 
As Reserve Bank Governor of Zimbabwe, Gono controls issues 
far beyond the purview of his portfolio and has used his 
influence to manipulate the economy and facilitate numerous 
corrupt deals for Zimbabwe's ruling elite. 
Gono, Mugabe's close advisor, wields influence over 
Zimbabwe's security services, judiciary, and ruling party to 
ensure Mugabe's often brutal and repressive policies are 
carried out, likely including the recent post March 29 
violence. 
 
Additionally, money that he printed as governor of the 
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe was used to pay military, war vets 
and the youth militia who carried out the violence. 
Gono is personally very wealthy, having been involved in a 
number of illicit deals to fund Mugabe's coffers and his own 
bank account.
