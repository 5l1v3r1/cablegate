REFTEL: REQUEST #4210016; DATED 5/28/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, OJSC RPE Kvant, Moscow, 
Russia. The company is listed on BIS license application D383270 as 
the ultimate consignee of one chemical vapor model E450LDM (MOCVD 
system) engineered for the high-volume production of compound 
semiconductor material. This item is controlled for national 
security and anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 3B001. The licensee 
is Veeco Instruments, 100 Sunnyside Boulevard, Woodbury, NY 11797. 
 
¶3. On August 27, 2009, Commercial Attach Katja Kravetsky and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the office of OJSC RPE Kvant, 3-rd Mytischinskaya 
street, 16, Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Prof. 
Marlen Kagan, Head of Photovoltaics Department, and Sergey Sharov, 
Chief Technologist. 
 
¶4. OJSC (Joint Stock Company) RPE Kvant is a state-owned enterprise 
(under the Russian Federal Space Agency), established in 2007 as a 
successor to RPE Kvant, founded in 1919; it currently employs a 
staff of over 1000.  RPE Kvant is a leading organization in Russia 
in the field of development and production of solar cells and solar 
batteries. Its products have both space and terrestrial 
applications. RPE Kvant participates in national and international 
conferences and exhibitions - most recently the Moscow Aerospace 
Show. The main commercial application for its production is in 
telecommunications. 
 
¶5. RPE Kvant provided documentation that supported the shipment 
reported in reftel. The export control team was able to identify and 
view the E450LDM MOCVD system at the RPE Kvant facilities. A Veeco 
Instruments representative worked with RPE Kvant to install the 
MOCVD system. It is currently functioning, but production will not 
commence until the end of the year. 
 
¶6.  The export control team found that the MOCVD system will be used 
for the end use for which it was licensed, there are no indications 
of impropriety, and the consigneeQs answers were not evasive. 
 
¶5. Recommendations: Post recommends OJSC RPE Kvant, Moscow, Russia, 
as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
