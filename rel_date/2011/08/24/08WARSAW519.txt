SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: APPROVAL OF WITNESS PROTECTION 
PROJECT UNDER THE 2002 LOA-PROJECT 3 
 
¶1. This is an action request for INL/AE.  Please see para 3-5. 
 
----------- 
Background 
----------- 
¶2. In November 2002, the U.S. signed a Letter of Agreement 
(LOA) with the GOP on "Financing the Activities Aimed at 
Preventing and Combating Crime in Poland." There were five 
projects outlined pursuant to this agreement to support 
these efforts. All projects, with the exception of Project 3 
have been successfully completed.  Project 3 aims to 
improve Courtroom Security and Witness Protection through 
training and procuring equipment and systems.  According to 
the LOA, a total of $122, 658 was allocated for Project 3. 
Out of this amount $26,658 has already been spent for 
training, and $96,000 has not yet been allocated.  Post would 
like to proceed with Project 3, and in paragraphs 3-5 
has outlined a proposal for completing the project.

Proposal for LOA - Project 3 
----------------------------- 
¶3. The equipment requested below is for the police unit 
responsible for the transportation of witnesses and for 
witness protection, including court room security. The unit 
composed of approximately 40 people, transports witnesses 
to and from court, but also protects them 24/7 if required 
due to the seriousness of their testimony. Legatt and PolOff 
have met with the team to discuss their needs, and strongly 
support their updated proposal for Project 3. Poland already 
has 
metal detectors outside most of their courts (this was the 
equipment initially listed in the LOA), however they do not 
have 
nor will they be able to obtain the equipment proposed below. 
Post has discussed these details via email with INL and 
thanks them in advance for their assistance.

requested, cost and the manufacturer or distributor of the
