¶1.  (U) Econoff met May 5 with Moroccan Ministry of 
Finance (MOF) official Mr. Abdelaziz Al Khaoua, head of 
banking and financial sector issues, to discuss 
terrorism finance-related matters and to deliver reftel 
demarche concerning the Government of Morocco (GOM) 
position on the MENA-FATF Charities Best Practices 
paper. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Al Khaoua explained that, as he understood, 
all participants at the MENA-FATF plenary had already 
accepted, in principle, the Charities paper and he did 
not understand USG request for an "official" GOM 
position. Econoff explained that USG is impressed with 
the document, and is requesting specific opinions from 
MENA countries regarding the content.  Al Khaoua 
responded that the length of the Charities paper is 
fine and it does not need to be diluted.  He explained, 
however, that GOM would need to look more closely at 
the document before delivering an official response.
