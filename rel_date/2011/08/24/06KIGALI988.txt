SUBJECT: RWANDA WILL VOTE FOR GUATEMALA 
 
REF: STATE 171921 
 
(SBU) Foreign Minister Charles Murigande telephoned Charge at 
2200 hours local time October 13 to state that the GOR 
intended to vote for Guatemala in "all voting rounds" of the 
UN General Assembly election for non-permanent members of the 
Security Council on October 16.  Murigande said that the 
GOR's support for Guatemala (although late in coming) 
"shouldn't be a surprise" in light of Venezuelan President 
Chavez's General Assembly speech violently castigating the 
USG and President Bush.
