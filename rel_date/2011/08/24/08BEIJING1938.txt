SUBJECT: PRC INFORMED OF IRAN'S IR-2 CENTRIFUGE CRITICAL 
EQUIPMENT NEEDS 
 
REF: STATE 52030 
 
¶1. (U) MFA Arms Control and Disarmament Department Nuclear 
Division Deputy Director Sun Lei told PolOff on May 19 that 
the PRC will closely examine reftel nonpaper and color 
photographs delineating Iran's critical equipment needs for 
their IR-2 centrifuge program.  Sun asked several times if 
the photos or nonpaper were classified and asked numerous 
questions about the status of Iran's IR-2 program.  PolOff 
told Sun all of the information is unclassified and that the 
Iranian IR-2 program was still in the testing and development 
phase, making it critical to prevent Iran from importing the 
necessary technologies and materials noted in the nonpaper. 
 
¶2. (U) Reiterating that China abides by all UNSCR 
requirements and Nuclear Supplier Group regulations, Sun 
claimed PRC export controls are "very stringent," and assured 
PolOff that the MFA would report reftel information to the 
relevant authorities.
