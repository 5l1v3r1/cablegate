¶1.  (SBU) Summary. Despite the global economic downturn and Turkish 
domestic political turmoil, the GOT successfully privatized two 
electricity distribution companies earlier this month.  This sale 
demonstrated Turkey's continuing ability to attract foreign 
investment, to command a good price and secure financing.  American 
company AES did not bid this time but is considering entering the 
next round to be held September 15.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) On July 2, the GOT announced the winners of the first 
electricity distribution privatization sale.  Five bidders competed 
to purchase the operating rights for the Baskent Electricity 
Distribution Inc. (BEDAS) which covers the capital city and 
surrounding towns (reftel).  The winning bid was Enerjisa, a 
consortium of Turkey's Sabanci Holding Austria's Verbund which paid 
USD 1.22 billion.  The second tender was for Sakarya Electricity 
Distribution Inc (SEDAS).  Again five bidders competed and Akcez 
Joint Partnership Group, a consortium of Turkey's Ak Enerji and the 
Czech Republic's CEZ, won the tender with a USD 600 million bid. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Winning bids were in line with market and GOT expectations. 
 Energy Ministry Advisor Zahit Karakaya said the GOT is satisfied 
with the prices and that higher loss rates justify a lower price for 
SEDAS.  Unit Energy Managing Director Enver Guney told us BEDAS and 
SEDAS sales prices were in line with his company's internal 
calculations.  Guney said his company, which partnered with Dogan 
Group and Dogus Group for the tender, decided not to bid 
aggressively now in favor of upcoming opportunities in Istanbul. 
Sabanci Energy Group Head Selahattin Hakman said publically the 
BEDAS acquisition is part of a larger Sabanci strategy to increase 
market share to 10% of Turkey's energy sector by 2015, which will 
require a USD 6.5 billion investment.  Electricity distribution 
privatization is critical to overcome the projected electricity 
supply shortages.  Enerjisa announced in July it signed a EURO 1 
billion loan for its energy sector investments which shows financers 
are positive about long-term growth prospects for Turkey's energy 
sector. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Turkey-based AES-ICTAS CEO Mark Green confirmed that AES, 
an American firm, did not participate in this first round of 
privatization.  Green said AES took a "wait and see" approach to 
this round, evaluating the debt-to-equity ratio of the winning bids 
and bidders' ability to raise financing in today's tight credit 
market.  Green thought the prices for BEDAS and SEDAS were on target 
and estimated the companies' worth at USD 1.5 billion and USD 
600-700 million, respectively.  AES is considering entering the next 
round of privatization but incomplete market de-regulation poses a 
risk for bidders.  Electricity shortages in near term (2-3 years) 
may significantly drive up the cost of the wholesale electricity 
power and the GOT has not instituted a mechanism to pass this cost 
along to the customer, which leaves prospective bidders, like AES, 
wondering whether they will be left with costs they can't recoup.
