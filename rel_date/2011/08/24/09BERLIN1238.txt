¶1. (SBU) EADS Defense and Security Head of Trade Compliance, 
Doris Wirth, informed EconOff that the reftel ITAR-controlled 
push button switches were purchased by EADS via Air Parts Ltd 
on August 28, 2007 (P.O. 422/4124963) in support of the 
Eurofighter Program.  Wirth did not specifically identify the 
ultimate governmental end-user, but did say that the parts 
would only be used by "one of the governments mentioned on 
the proviso" (sic) in support of the Eurofighter program. 
She also said the items are yet to be incorporated into an 
aircraft and remain at an EADS warehouse in Manching. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Wirth said the parts were delivered to EADS on July 
11, 2008 and that EADS was not/not provided with accompanying 
written notification from Hartwell regarding any ITAR 
re-export limitations.  Wirth provided scanned copies of the 
purchase order and acknowledgment of receipt for the parts. 
(COMMENT: EconOff will send this documentation to Blue 
Lantern Coordinator via unclassified email.  END COMMENT)
