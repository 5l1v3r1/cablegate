MAINTAINING SECURITY AROUND OIL TERMINALS 
 
Kuwaiti/Iraqi Naval Officers Meet on USS Lake Champlain 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶1.  On an encouraging note in an otherwise strained bilateral 
relationship, eight Iraqi and ten Kuwaiti junior naval 
officers participated in a military-military exchange and 
training opportunity April 15 on Ticonderoga class cruiser 
USS Lake Champlain in the northern Arabian Gulf.  The event, 
sponsored by Combined Task Force 152 (CTF 152) and Combined 
Task Force Iraq Maritime (CTF IM), was the first of 12 
monthly proposed engagements designed to help action officers 
of the two navies restore ties and build the requisite 
cooperation to safeguard the waters shared by Kuwait and 
Iraq.  The itinerary of the event included a briefing, a 
search and rescue demonstration, a tour of the ship, and 
lunch.  Though initially hesitant to engage, the former 
enemies warmed up to each other during the course of the 
joint exercise, offering hope that such exchanges will 
continue in the future. 
 
Background:  Partnership is Needed to Maintain Security 
around Oil Terminals 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
 
¶2.  Combined Task Force 158 (CTF 158), which oversees US and 
coalition ships involved in maritime security operations in 
the northern Arabian Gulf, began measures in 2008 to build 
partnerships between the Kuwaiti and Iraqi Navies and to 
establish operation protocols in and around the Northern 
Gulf's Khor Abdullah Waterway.  CTF 158's primary mission is 
maintaining security -- in support of UNSCR 1790 and 1546 
endorsing MNF authority to take measures that contribute to 
the security and stability in Iraq -- in and around both the 
Al Basrah (ABOT) and Khor Al Amaya Oil Terminals (KAAOT). 
(Note:  Per CTF 158, over three quarters of Iraqi GDP is 
generated from the oil that flows through these terminals. 
End note.) 
 
KAA Interoperability Protocols 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  One such set of protocols brokered by CTF 158 was the the 
Khor Abdullah (KAA) Interoperability Protocols signed by the 
Kuwaiti and Iraqi navies on November 11, 2008.  This 
agreement established standard protocols for operations in 
the KAA Waterway (the waterway between Kuwait's Bubiyan 
Island and Iraq, and Iraq's only outlet to the Arabian Gulf). 
 They govern passage in the KAA and routine reporting from 
shore-based operations centers and also lay out grid markers 
as an easy reference system for reporting positions of 
suspected threats to national sovereignty, smugglers or 
illegal fishing in the KAA or in neighboring waters.

KAA REPORTING PROTOCOLS 
 
¶1.    INITIAL MORNING DAILY CALLS.  To be made by respective 
shore-based operations centers of the KNF, KCG and IQN.

throughout the KAA both landward and seaward of point 162 (N 
29 51' 9.6234"; E 48 24'50.8383).  Calls are to occur no 
later than 0900 HRS (local). 
¶2.    UPDATED VESSEL POSITION REPORTING AT SEA.  All KNF, KCG

and seaward of point 162 (N 29 51' 9.6234"; E 48 24' 50.8383) 
are to use the KAA Interoperability Grid as an easy reference 
system to report their own position and any other activity of 
importance to one another as well as to CTG C/S "Bravo 
Oscar."  Channel 69 is to be used.  Vessels are to update 
their positions to their shore-based operations centers 
should they significantly alter from that previously briefed 
during morning daily calls. 
¶3.    CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND MARITIME INCIDENT REPORTING.  All 
KNF, KCG and IQN vessels are to use the KAA Interoperability 
grid system to report to shore-based operations centers or 
each other any criminal activity and maritime incidents 
within the KAA up to and beyond point 162 (N 29 51' 9.6234"; 
E 48 24' 50.8383).  This includes smuggling, other illegal 
activity and fishing in neighboring waters.  Fishing 
incidents are to be resolved and co-ordinated between the 
 
KUWAIT 00000465  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
on-scene KNG, KCG and IQN vessels.  CTG 158.1 "Bravo Oscar" 
should be informed.  Fishermen are to be escorted to 
neighboring territorial waters and handed over to the 
on-scene KU/IQ vessels. 
¶4.    KU/IQ VESSEL INFORMATION EXCHANGE AT SEA.  All KNF, 
KUCG and IQN vessels are to exchange information using the 
reporting format below and following example. 
a.    Unit Callsign / b. Vessel Type / c. Area of Operation 
using the KAA Interoperability grid system / d. Duration of 
operation / e. Reason for Report / f. Any actions being taken 
by the respective vessel and/or shore-based operations center. 
¶5.    FUTURE KU/IQ MARITIME PROTOCOLS, ARRANGEMENTS OR 
AGREEMENTS.  Nothing in these protocols should restrict KNF, 
DCG or IQN authorities in anyway whatsoever from future 
development and/or introduction of alternative protocols, 
arrangements and agreements as determined by all parties.

UNCLOS ARTICLE 19 
 
All vessels are to adhere to the internationally legally 
recognized definition of "Innocent Passage" when transiting

point 162 N 29 51' 9.6234"; E 48 24' 50.8383). 
¶1.    Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to 
the peace, good order or security of the coastal State.  Such 
passage shall take place in conformity with this Convention 
and with other rules of international law. 
¶2.    Passage of a foreign ship shall be considered to be 
prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the 
coastal State if in the territorial sea it engages in any of 
the following activities:

territorial integrity or political independence of the
