SUBJECT: BRAZIL: (SOME) PARLIAMENTARIANS SIGN PETITION 
AGAINST CUBAN EMBARGO 
 
¶1.  Seventy-five Brazilian federal deputies signed and 
forwarded to this Embassy a petition addressed to the U.S. 
Congress asking it to "intercede with representatives of the 
UN General Assembly to suspend the financial, commercial, and 
economic blockade imposed on Cuba, a matter voted on in the 
General Assembly on October 29, 2008."  The petition arrived 
together with a nearly identical petition signed by 85 
Brazilian federal deputies and two senators, including the 
president of the senate, addressed to "representatives of the 
United Nations," presumably the US Mission to the UN. 
 
¶2.  Unofficial Embassy translation of the petition to the 
U.S. Congress follows: 
 
(Begin text.) 
 
Petition 
 
We, Brazilian parliamentarians - the under-signed ) ask the 
National Congress of the United States of America ) to 
intercede with representatives of the UN General Assembly to 
suspend the financial, commercial, and economic blockade 
imposed on Cuba, a matter voted in the Assembly on October 
29, 2008. 
 
Cuba, which already is going through difficult conditions 
because of the almost half century long North American 
blockade, has been forced to put into practice a series of 
internal counter-measures in the face of the flagrant 
violation of the human rights of 11 million Cubans, affecting 
even those who live in the United States, besides the rights 
of the United States citizens themselves. 
 
This scandalous and arrogant interference in the affairs of 
an independent country harms the fundamental principles of 
the sovereignty of nations and the self-determination of 
peoples inscribed in the UN Charter. 
 
With the certainly that we will be heard, we are sending this 
document with numbered pages and signed by all.

192 members of the UN, be carried out in practice. 
 
The fulfillment of this decision is based on the principles 
of the sovereignty of nations and the self-determination of 
peoples inscribed in the UN Charter.
