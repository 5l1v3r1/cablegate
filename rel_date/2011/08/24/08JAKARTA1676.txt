JAKARTA 00001676  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (U) This message requests Department's guidance by 
September 10.  Please see para 8 for action request. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Legal proceedings are scheduled to begin 
in the Central Jakarta District Court on September 17 in the 
avian-influenza lawsuit against the USG and the World Health 
Organization (refs).  A key contact at the Indonesian 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) has asked Mission to 
submit a letter to the court explaining the concept of 
sovereign immunity, which he would send to the court with an 
opinion from DEPLU.  Although he stated that a proceeding 
would likely still be necessary, he believed that the judges 
could dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds, if given 
the legal basis to do so.  Mission requests immediate 
authorization to draft this letter in conjunction with the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) and local counsel.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DEPLU RECOMMENDS COURSE OF ACTION 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On August 13, Mission sent a Diplomatic Note to the 
Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) asserting 
sovereign immunity, as instructed by Washington (reftel).  On 
September 2, DCM, Poloff and DOJ Resident Legal Advisor (RLA) 
met with Arif Havas Oegroseno, Director of DEPLU's Office of 
Political, Legal and Regional Treaties.  During that meeting, 
Oegroseno stated he would have an informal conversation with 
the court about the case. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On September 5, DCM, Poloff and DOJ Resident Legal 
Advisor (RLA) met with Arif Havas Oegroseno again at his 
request.  Oegroseno stated he had discussed the case with the 
court and, based on his conversation with the court, 
recommended Mission prepare a letter, addressed to the court, 
explaining the basis for sovereign immunity in international 
law, and requesting the case be dismissed on the grounds of 
lack of jurisdiction.  Oegroseno asked that the letter be 
sent to DEPLU under cover of a diplomatic note.  He explained 
that he would then submit our letter with a legal opinion 
from DEPLU to the court.  He clarified that the letter should 
only discuss jurisdiction to adjudicate the case and not 
touch on the merits of the case. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mission asked whether the World Health Organization 
(WHO) should submit a similar letter to the court through 
DEPLU.  Oegroseno stated that he could offer no opinion on 
the best course of action with the WHO because he had not 
spoken to any WHO representatives or received their assertion 
of immunity. 
 
DEPLU OFFERS POSTPONEMENT OF THE TRIAL 
 
¶7.  (SBU) At the September 5 meeting, Oegroseno said the 
court could consider postponing the date of the proceeding by 
three months.  Oegroseno agreed that the current U.S., 
 
JAKARTA 00001676  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Indonesia, and Australia conversations regarding sample 
sharing were important and noted the postponement could give 
interlocutors additional time to discuss sample sharing 
without the potential disruption caused by the civil suit. 
 
ACTION REQUEST 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Mission requests immediate authorization to draft 
the requested letter, in conjunction with the Department of 
Justice (DOJ) and local counsel.  Mission requests the 
Department's guidance, before September 10, as to which 
specific points to make in the requested letter regarding 
jurisdiction and the USG claim of sovereign immunity.
