¶1.  (SBU) The CDA convened the Emergency Action Committee (EAC) on 
Tuesday, February 24, to review the general security situation in 
light of yesterday's notice that the International Criminal Court 
(ICC) will announce its indictment decision on March 4.  The DCM, 
PAO, USAID A/MD, USAID EXO, POL, MGT, CONS, RAO, DLO, RMO, OBO PD, 
OBO SSM, and RSO were in attendance. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The CDA reminded the EAC that the ICC announcement, along 
with other security issues the Mission continues to monitor will 
impact our security posture.  In light of the looming ICC 
announcement, the ever-present terrorist threat and physical 
security vulnerabilities of the Chancery and other Mission 
facilities, the CDA said every effort should be made to decrease the 
number of American and TCN employees in Sudan.  He asked the EAC to 
identify ways to lower the USG footprint until after the March 4 ICC 
announcement.  The EAC agreed on the following additional security 
measures that will be implemented immediately: 
 
- Cancel all TDY visits to Embassy Khartoum, with the exception of 
DS and OBO employees, until further notice.  ConGen Juba can still 
allow TDY visitors, but they cannot transit Khartoum. 
 
- Embassy Khartoum Agency Heads and Section Chiefs must review the 
status of all TDY personnel currently at post to determine which 
non-Mission critical TDY employees should be asked to leave early in 
order to reduce the Mission's footprint. 
 
- The Embassy will remain open on March 4 and 5, but will operate 
under a liberal leave policy, with American staff, as appropriate, 
being encouraged to work from at home.    No outside visitors or 
appointments should be scheduled on these days.  The NEC will 
operate on a business-as-usual basis. 
 
- No in-country travel requests will be approved after March 2 until 
further notice.  This also applies to ConGen Juba employees. 
 
- No Khartoum International Airport arrivals/departures are allowed 
on March 4 or 5. 
 
- Official Americans are not allowed to travel across any of the 
bridges leading outside of Khartoum City Center from March 3 to 
March 6. 
 
- Beginning immediately, official Americans traveling within 
Khartoum must radio arrival and departure vehicle movements to the 
TOC on Channel 1 using the brevity codes and examples outlined in a 
security handout. 
 
- All official Americans must bring their handheld radios with them 
to the expanded Country Team on February 25 for radio refresher 
training.  Specifically, the IMO will remind users how to place the 
radio in the "sleep" mode to avoid hearing radio "traffic" during 
meetings or at night. 
 
- All official Americans should keep a copy of their 
Diplomatic/Official passports or Diplomatic IDs with them at all 
times. 
 
- All official Americans must be sure their Grab & Go bag is packed 
and accessible. 
 
- The Embassy auction has been postponed until March 15. 
 
- The EAC cleared the revised Travel Warning, which will be sent out 
to all registered American Citizens via e-mail and SMS text message. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The EAC also discussed the possibility of requesting 
authorized or ordered departures for family members only.  No 
decision on this matter was made, but it remains part of contingency 
plans to reduce the number of official Americans at post.
