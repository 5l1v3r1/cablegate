¶1. (U) Econoff delivered reftel demarche August 25 to MFA 
Office Director for Humanitarian Intervention and Evaluation 
Christian Bernard.  Points were also provided to MFA 
Development Office of Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction 
head Emmanuel Delloye.  Christian confirmed that French 
assistance to date consisted of 15 million euros as part of a 
50 million EU commitment announced August 1; the MFA 
organized ship "Cap Camarat" that delivered 1500 tons of 
humanitarian aid August 17, representing 3.5 million euros, 
2.2 million of which were from the GOF; 15 Bailey bridges 
dispatched from Marseilles August 24; and GOF contributions 
to date to international agencies.  These consist of two 
million euros for the World Food Program; and one million 
euros for the International Committee of the Red Cross; and 
one million euros for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Christian hinted that additional efforts were under 
discussion that could be announced at Stockholm, but offered 
no details and made no promises. He said that future efforts 
would focus primarily on reconstruction rather than 
humanitarian aid.  Post will report any further information 
we receive in advance of the Stockholm conference.
