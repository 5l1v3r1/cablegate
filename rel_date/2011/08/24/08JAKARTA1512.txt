¶1. (U) Summary: Avian influenza test results are still unavailable 
on the samples from the twelve individuals hospitalized in North 
Sumatra with flu-like symptoms.  The health of the hospitalized 
patients continues to improve.  Clinical findings are not consistent 
with avian influenza.  The Indonesian Department of Agriculture 
confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in the 
district.  Indonesian government officials are treating the outbreak 
seriously.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Samples from the twelve individuals from Asahan district 
hospitalized at Asahan and Adam Malik hospitals arrived at the 
Indonesian National Institute of Health Research and Development 
(NIHRD) in the late morning August 8, and initial testing likely 
will not be complete until the evening of August 8 at the earliest. 
Given the potential seriousness of the outbreak, NIHRD will likely 
run tests two or three times before releasing any data.  Embassy 
will inform Washington immediately if any of the samples test 
positive for avian influenza. 
 
¶3. (U) WHO and hospital officials in Asahan indicate that the health 
of the ten patients treated in Asahan district hospital continues to 
improve and that all are expected to recover fully.  The currently 
hospitalized cases were found through contact tracing of the 
patients who had died.  Contact with fever symptoms of an 
influenza-like illness were sent to hospital for observation.  None 
of patients who remained in Asahan currently have a temperature over 
38 degrees centigrade and chest radiographs are reported to be 
clear.  Tamiflu has been administered to all patients and exposed 
hospital staff.  Prophylaxis doses are not being administered in the 
affected village. 
 
¶4. (U) Two pediatric cases with particularly severe symptoms were 
sent to Adam Malik provincial hospital for treatment.  According to 
the head of the hospital's infectious disease unit, one of the two 
patients under his care is slowly improving and has clear 
radiographs.  The other patient, an eight month-old child, had a 
fever of 39 degrees throughout the day.  This child's radiograph 
revealed a consolidation in the right lung.  Both patients are being 
treated with Tamiflu and antibiotics. 
 
¶5. (U) According to the FAO, avian influenza outbreaks have been 
reported in poultry in Asahan district by Ministry of Agriculture 
PDSR teams since 2006.  The local PDSR team initially responded to a 
report of sudden poultry death August 4.  Using the standard case 
definition and rapid test positive for influenza A, the PDSR 
officers confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry, 
culled all poultry in the village and disinfected the entire 
village.  Samples were not collected because the PDSR officers did 
not have the equipment necessary to transport samples.  Embassy has 
received reports that culling is completed in the affected area. 
 
¶6. (U) We have received numerous reports that the potential outbreak 
is being taken very seriously and that local officials are following 
appropriate guidelines.  An interagency command post has been set up 
to manage the situation and local authorities have mobilized 
throughout the district to strengthen monitoring and outreach 
efforts.
