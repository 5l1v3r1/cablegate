     Â¶B. 7/22-24/2009 E-MAILS BETWEEN JKUO AND JELLISON 
 
(SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche to MFA Afghanistan Desk 
Officer Vitaliy Rugalev.  He had no immediate response, in 
light of Russia's recent commitment to permit overflights of 
Russian territory to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan. 
He suggested the topic would be an appropriate agenda item 
for the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Commission expected to meet 
this Fall.
