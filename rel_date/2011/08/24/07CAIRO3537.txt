1.(U)  On December 25, the Office of the Public Prosecutor 
ordered the release of three members of the Middle East 
Christians Association (MECA) held since their November 10 
arrests for allegedly "fueling sectarianism" and "insulting 
Islam" (ref A and B).  The three were released, without 
charges, late on the afternoon of December 26. Our 
understanding is that all three returned to their residences 
in Cairo and Alexandria.  The three still could be charged 
criminally or face private lawsuits. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  The reasons for the release are not clear. 
Under Egypt's criminal code, a suspect may be held without 
charges for up to five consecutive fifteen-day periods.  In 
this case, the third fifteen-day detention period had just 
expired, and a lawyer for one detainee told us that 
investigators in the prosecutor's office missed a deadline 
for requesting renewal of the detention.  Another possible 
explanation is that the government believed it had delivered 
a sufficiently strong warning to the detainees and MECA, and 
there was no point in holding the three any longer, 
especially in light of the attention the case was attracting 
(ref C).
