SUBJECT: COUNTRY TEAM ASSESSMENT FOR EQUIPPING NINE 
ADDITIONAL IRAQI FORCE GENERATION UNITS 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action request, please see paragraph 10. 
 
¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The U.S Embassy Country Team concurs with 
the full and immediate equipping of nine additional Iraqi 
army units via Foreign Military Sales (FMS) as a part of the 
force generation plan. The GOI will generate these units to 
provide for its own security and defend against the insurgent 
threat. The plan includes provisions for equipping, training, 
and basing and will have a significant positive impact on the 
improvement of the Iraqi Armed Forces. With the expansion of 
the Iraqi armed forces, these newly establiShed force 
generation organizations will enhance their ability to select 
and identify known terrorists and insurgents, which will 
significantly reduce the possibility for coalition collateral 
damage. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3. (SBU) SECURITY GOALS: This Country Team Assessment (CTA) 
addresses Letters of Request (LOR) for nine Iraqi Army (IA) 
units. These units include an Iraqi division Headquarters, 
Division troops and the subordinate Brigade Headquarters 
units. Specific units to be generated include: 
 
-- 12th Division IA headquarters 
-- 12th IA Brigade - Tikrit 
-- 3/14th IA Brigade 
-- 4/7th IA Brigade 
-- 4/14th IA Brigade 
-- 14th Division troops 
-- Three (3) Iraqi Army brigade headquarters 
-- Four (4) light infantry battalions 
 
The LORs also include requests for individual soldier 
equipment to be stocked at the basic training combat center. 
The equipping of these units will be funded with host nation 
funds through an FMS case financed by the GOI. The Iraqi 
Armed Forces are projected to integrate the acquisition of 
this equipment with trained personnel beginning in July 2008 
to offset a draw down in Coalition Forces (CF). The Embassy 
country team supports a full and immediate release of the 
required equipment and continued training of leaders 
including officers, non commissioned officer and soldiers to 
establish these organizations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) JUSTIFICATION: The generation and fielding of these 
units will enhance Iraq's development of a force capable of 
assuming the lead role in internal offensive and defensive 
missions, secure the nation of Iraq, ensure the security of 
the Iraqi population, and counter the existing insurgency. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COCOM CONCURRANCE ON THE INTRODUCTION OF FORCE 
GENERATION UNITS: The Combatant Commander's (CENTCOM) 
assessment and concurrence will be provided separately. 
 
¶6. (SBU) ANTICIPATED REACTION FROM NEIGHBORING      CONTRIES: 
 The Country Team does not anticipate that the development of 
these new units will adversely affect the regional balance of 
power with neighboring nations or cause negative reactions 
from other nations. 
 
¶7. (SBU) TECHNOLOGY ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY:  Iraq 
has demonstrated both the intent and ability to protect 
sensitive and classified military technology since working 
with us and Coalition Forces.  The Foreign Assistance Act, 
Section 505 agreement, signed by the GOI on 24 July 2004, 
demonstrates Iraq's commitment to protect grant defense 
articles and technology similar to our standards. We will 
continue to monitor the GOI on their protection of sensitive 
U.S. Government (USG) technology in order to provide 
long-term security cooperation with Iraq.  We will also 
obtain all necessary formal agreements with the GOI before|t(TUY carry out a robust Enhanced End-Use 
Monitoring (EEUM) program for equipping these force 
generation units. Technologies that are considered sensitive 
and require End-Use agreements have been previously procured 
through the FMS cases and include over 2000 Night Vision 
Goggles and ITT radios (COMSEC including 139 
base stations, 1402 vehicular mounted and 3240 hand held 
portable VHF varieties. 
 
¶8. (SBU) COALITION TRAINING PLAN: This training will be 
conducted and demonstrated by the partnering nations 
agreement under the general supervision of the Coalition 
training plan and as determined by the country team.

¶9. (SBU) IRAQ'S POLITICAL IMPORTANCE IN THE REGION: A stable, 
democratically-elected Iraqi government, capable of 
protecting its people and sovereignty--while remaining at 
peace with its neighbors--is one of the USG's highest 
priority foreign policy objectives. The establishment and 
implementation of these force generation units will 
facilitate progress towards that goal by increasing the Iraqi 
Army's ability to provide security and other key military 
operations against anti-Iraqi forces, while significantly 
reducing the risk to itself and others. 
 
¶10. (SBU) SOURCE OF FINANCING AND ECONOMIC IMPACT:  This 
purchase will be financed by the GOI with Iraqi national 
funds.  The cost is estimated in CY2008 funds at 6,69M 
dollars (as rough order of magnitude). We do not envision 
that USG approval of this technology release will in any way 
adversely affect either Iraqi or USG programmed funding. 
There is no significant economic impact based upon our 
analysis processes in anticipation of these critical FMS 
cases. 
 
¶11. (SBU) RELEVANT HUMAN RIGHTS CONSIDERATIONS:  There are no 
human rights considerations that would preclude the release 
of this equipment to the Iraqi military. 
 
¶12. (SBU) END USE MONITORING: Sensitive items identified and 
described in paragraph 7 are subject to end user monitoring 
as agreed upon between host nation and the multi-national 
coalition forces and alignment with the security assistance 
office policy and procedures guidance. 
 
¶13. (SBU) COUNTRY TEAM ASSESSMENT: The U.S. Embassy Baghdad 
Country Team recommends that the USG approve the 
establishment and equipping of the nine (9) force generation 
units described in paragraph 3. 
 
¶14. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  The Embassy Country Team requests 
the Department engage with the Deputy Secretary of the Army 
for Defense Export Cooperation and other relevant offices to 
approve the full and immediate release the creation and 
generation of the nine (9) force generation LORS 
authenticated and signed by the Iraqi Minister of Defense.
