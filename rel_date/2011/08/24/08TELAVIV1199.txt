SUBJECT: BARAK REQUESTS ADDITIONAL DEFENSE SUPPORT FROM 
CODEL PELOSI 
 
1.(SBU) SUMMARY: On May 18, Speaker of the House, Nancy 
Pelosi,s bi-partisan delegation met with Minister of 
Defense, Ehud Barak. Barak told CODEL Pelosi that: 1) 
radical Islamic terror, 2) proliferation of nuclear weapons, 
and 3) rogue states are the most prominent threats facing the 
"free world" today and identified Iran as Israel's largest 
long-term security threat. Barak called on the US congress 
to approve an upcoming defense package for Israel and 
requested help in funding the &Iron Dome8 multi-layered 
rocket defense project. He also expressed the GOI,s desire 
to be integrated into the Global Early Warning System for 
missile and rocket attacks. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.(SBU) Barak began the meeting by focusing on Israel,s 
immediate security situation, saying that many changes in 
policy were needed in the short term. He stated that Israel 
must continue efforts to reach an agreement with the 
Palestinians, though he was not optimistic about this 
happening anytime in the near future. He said a new strategy 
for dealing with Gaza would need to be developed in light of 
Hamas' newest tactic of attacking the territory's own 
infrastructure and border posts. 
 
------------------ 
THE IRANIAN THREAT 
------------------ 
 
3.(SBU) Highlighting the flow of support for terrorism from 
Tehran to Syria, Gaza and Lebanon, Barak identified Iran as 
central to Israel's long-term security challenges. In spite 
of the American intelligence assessment on the matter, Barak 
cautioned the CODEL that Iran's intentions to build a nuclear 
arsenal were clear. He said that the world must act to 
prevent this from happening. The minister criticized recent 
world efforts as heavy in rhetoric but weak in action. Barak 
said stronger methods should be pursued and all options 
should be considered. While he doubted the longevity of the 
Ayatollahs' rule in Iran over the next ten years, Barak 
cautioned that permitting Iranian nuclear weapons to be 
developed would pose a great proliferation risk, no matter 
what regime was controlling Iran in the future. 
 
4.(SBU) He also said that steps must be taken to block Iran 
from developing the capacity to build light oil distillation 
plants, thereby preventing any improvements in its economic 
situation. Barak expressed great concern that Lebanon, 
Syria, and Iran were becoming increasingly coordinated. He 
warned that Damascas was biding time, hoping that less 
pressure would be placed upon it by a new administration in 
Washington. 
 
------------------------------ 
ROCKET ATTACK DETERRENT SYSTEM 
------------------------------ 
 
5.(SBU) Noting that new technology would increase the range 
and efficiency of rocket attacks on Israel, Barak said that 
Israel must develop a multi-layered deterrent system and 
could only do so with the help of the US. He noted that new 
"Shihab" rockets were under development and might soon be 
used to reach further and with greater accuracy into 
Israel,s civilian population from Iran. Barak requested 
support for Israel,s membership in the Global Early Warning 
System. As the threat of an attack by Iran with long range 
missiles increases, Barak said that Israel's Arrow ballistic 
missile defense system seeks a 99 percent sucessful 
interception rate against potential attacks. He also 
requested US assistance in funding the "Iron Dome" short 
range rocket defense project. The minister claimed that 
development of the Iron Dome technology would be beneficial 
to US defense interests. 
 
6.(SBU) Speaker Pelosi affirmed the US Congress, solid 
bi-partisan support for Israel,s qualitative military 
advantage and President Bush,s plan to realize a two-state 
solution within the year.
