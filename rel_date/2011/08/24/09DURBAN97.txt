¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  On Wednesday, September 16, 2009, Durban 
Political and Economic Officer met with and interviewed 
Warehouse Manager Nathi Khomongoe, Sales Executive Andre van der 
Merwe, and Warehouse Dispatch Ian Davies at the African Outdoor 
Sports (AOS) warehouse in Pinetown, KwaZulu Natal.  AOS staff 
were responsive to all questions sent by the Office of Defense 
Trade Controls Compliance.  Pol/Econ Officer concludes that AOS 
is a bona fide end-user.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Please find below AOS's responses to questions from 
State 080202: 
 
When was your company established and who are its principals? 
African Hunting Supplies was established in 1996 and trades 
under the name African Outdoor Sports.  Its principals are John 
Fuller (Australian citizen) and Reno van Heerden (South African 
citizen).  Fuller visits the warehouse four to six times a year. 
 van Heerden visits often but works mostly from the company's 
Pretoria-based headquarters. 
 
What products and services does your company provide? 
AOS sells crossbows, carbon dioxide pistols, rifles, pepper 
spray, stun guns, paint guns, binoculars, hunting lamps, knives, 
blow pipes, pump action rifles, live ammunition, and hunting 
clothes.  AOS does not provide any services. 
 
How long have you been in the business of importing and selling 
defense articles? 
AOS has been in the business of importing and selling defense 
articles since its establishment in 1996.  From the U.S., AOS 
imports Sierra bullets, Mossberg rifles, and Hauwer rifles; from 
Finland, Sako-Tikka rifles; from Yugoslavia, Zastava rifles; 
from Taiwan, slingshots, crossbows, arrows, and blow pipes; from 
China, hunting clothes, gun safes, and Nikko-Stirling scopes; 
and from Turkey, Hatsan air rifles and shot guns.  AOS used to 
import Nikko-Stirling scopes from Korea. 
 
Who are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
AOS sells only to gun dealers and sporting goods stores. 
Forty-four percent of AOS's customers reside in the Gauteng 
province; 12 percent in the Northwest province; 11 percent in 
the Western Cape province; nine percent in the Northern Cape 
province; seven percent in the Free State province; seven 
percent in the Mpumalanga province; five percent in the KwaZulu 
Natal province; five percent in the Eastern Cape province; and 
three percent in the Eastern Cape province.  ASO sells hunting 
accessories to customers in Namibia and Botswana, which 
constitute five and two percent of their customer base, 
respectively.  ASO does not sell any fire arms or ammunition to 
customers in other countries. 
 
What specific ammunition components will you import on these 
licenses? 
ASO will import reloading bullets, ammunition, complete 
cartridges, and primers. 
 
What calibers will the finished ammunition be? 
The calibers will be: 22 room fire, 22 hornet, 222, 223, 243, 
270, 30M1 carbon, 308, 3006, 7 millimeter Rem Mag, 300 
Winchester Magnum, and 303. 
 
For what is ammunition of this caliber generally used in South 
Africa? 
In South Africa, ammunition of this caliber is generally used 
for hunting, target practice, and recreational activities. 
 
Why did you issue two separate purchase orders on these 
transactions as opposed to placing one order with the U.S. 
vendor? 
AOS does not have the warehouse space to stock two containers at 
once.  Receiving one container at a time will allow AOS time to 
sell the items from the first container and keep the items from 
the second for shelf stock. 
 
What are your annual sales of firearms and ammunition? 
From July 2008 to June 2009, AOS sold R6.2 million ($833,000) 
worth of firearms.  During the same time period, AOS sold R5 
million ($672,000) worth of live ammunition and R4.3 million 
($578,000) worth of bullets. 
 
Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import of 
 
DURBAN 00000097  002 OF 002 
 
 
U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
Yes.  AOS is familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export.  AOS does not re-transfer or re-export 
any defense articles. 
 
Comment 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Pol/Econ Officer found the AOS warehouse to be fully 
operational, well organized and staffed by knowledgeable and 
competent employees.  All guns and ammunition are stored in 
secure, large vaults.  Access to the warehouse is restricted to 
five government screened, trained and certified employees. 
Based on his site visit, Pol/Econ Officer concludes that African 
Outdoor Sports is a bona fide end-user.
