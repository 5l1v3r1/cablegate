EXEMPTION QUESTIONS 
 
REF: 06 STATE 191752 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  After the MFA Cuba desk officer delayed 
for a month responding to USG reftel requests for an update 
on French activities in Cuba during 2006, then stated he 
did not intend to do so, DAS-equivalent Blandine Kreiss 
affirmed January 26 that the GOF objected to the 
extraterritorial reach of the Helms-Burton economic embargo 
and that the GOF therefore would not respond to USG 
questions related to the renewal of France's exemption from 
Libertad Act sanctions.  Kreiss cited a 1998 agreement 
between the United States and the European Union as 
justification for suspending Helms-Burton reporting 
requirements and concluded by expressing the hope that this 
stance would not lead to a U.S. reaction, especially "at 
this time of transition in Cuba."  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In a January 26 conversation, DAS-equivalent 
Blandine Kreiss confirmed to POL Deputy a January 23 
written response from MFA Desk officer for Cuba Othman El 
Kachtoul to Poloff, to the effect that the GOF rejected as 
a matter of principle the extra-territorial reach of 
Helms-Burton and therefore would not respond as a matter of 
principle to USG inquiries related to the renewal of 
France's exemption from possible Libertad Act sanctions. 
Both El Kachtoul and Kreiss cited the 1997 and 1998 
agreements between the United States and the European Union 
suspending Title III of the Helms-Burton Amendment as 
justification for this refusal. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Kreiss and El Kachtoul stated clearly that 
France largely shares U.S. policy objectives of encouraging 
democratization on the island.  El Kachtoul had earlier 
indicated that France supported liberating all political 
prisoners and encouraged a process of transition toward 
democratic pluralism and respect for human rights, as well 
as improving the standard of living of the Cuban people. 
He noted in addition France's support in the UN Human 
Rights Council its support for a resolution on Cuba. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Without enumerating specific French activities 
but referring indirectly to French intentions for the 
future, Kreiss noted continuing contact between France and 
civil society figures in Cuba and referred to a French 
invitation to invite Cuban journalists to France in coming 
weeks.   Kreiss concluded with the hope that the GOF 
refusal to answer explicit questions about French 
activities in Cuba would not lead to a U.S. reaction, 
especially "at this time of transition in Cuba."
