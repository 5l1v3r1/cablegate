REF: STATE 9925 
 
We spoke on January 31 about the USG plan to clear Liberia's arrears 
to the international financial institutions, per reftel, with Ramon 
Fernandez, PDAS for international finance and development affairs at 
the French Ministry of Finance.  Fernandez reported that France 
supports moving forward with arrears clearance at the World Bank. 
On IMF clearances, he reported that the finance deputies discussed 
the issue at their latest G7 meeting in Berlin.  He agreed that 
significant issues remain for the IMF about the level of resources 
available, so arrears clearance will take additional time.  On the 
African Development Bank, he reported that France still thinks the 
AfDB should stick to the rules (i.e., a balanced contribution 
between the AfDB and donor resources).  He concluded that France 
remains committed to finding a way to move the issues forward.
