¶1. (U) This is a PRT Tikrit, Salah ad Din reporting cable. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The key concern during the initial cases heard by 
the new ad Din Province Major Crimes Court was whether local 
judges would have the courage to carry out their duties or 
whether they would succumb to intimidation by the insurgency 
and refuse to hear terrorism cases or dispose of them 
corruptly. The three defendants on trial were self-confessed 
members of Al-Qaeda; all were found guilty.  Based on 
comments and reaction from Iraqi Police (IP) officers, it is 
believed that the verdicts in these three cases will have a 
very positive effect on the morale of the IP in Salah ad Din 
Province. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------- 
MCC BEGINS HEARING TRIALS 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) On September 9, the Salah ad Din Province Major Crimes 
Court (MCC) opened pursuant to an Order passed by the Chief 
Justice of Iraq.  The new Salah ad Din MCC is located in a 
heavily fortified complex on FOB Danger in downtown Tikrit. 
The MCC was specially built for the purpose of hearing 
terrorism cases.  Regular non-terrorism cases will continue 
to be heard at the old Tikrit City courthouse. 
 
¶4. (U) Prior to the opening of the MCC, the PRT believed that 
the "traveling judges" concept would be used to staff the 
court.  Under this concept, judges from outside the Province 
are brought in for 30 day periods to hear terrorism cases. 
The purpose of using "out of town" judges is of course to 
minimize the possibility that the insurgency will resort to 
threats and violence against the judges so as to compromise 
the integrity of the court.  However, the Chief Justice of 
Iraq declined to approve the use of traveling judges for the 
Salah ad Din MCC, instead ordering that it be staffed by 
local judges. 
 
¶5. (U) All of the defendants on trial this week were 
self-confessed members of Al-Qaeda.  All three were found 
guilty.  The defendant in the first trial was convicted of 
kidnapping ) he received a sentence of 15 years in prison. 
In the second and third cases, the defendants were charged 
with multiple counts of murder.  Having been found guilty, 
both defendants were sentenced to death. 
 
¶6. (SBU) PRT observes that the victims in the murder cases 
were Iraqi Police officers.  Based on comments and reaction 
from Iraqi Police (IP) officers in the wake of the verdicts 
in these cases, it is believed that the verdicts in these 
three cases will have a very positive effect on the morale of 
the IP in Salah ad Din Province.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: PRT is keeping a close watch on the outcome 
of proceedings at the MCC.  PRT remains concerned about the 
insurgency's ability to influence proceedings at the MCC by 
threatening the safety of local judges and their families. 
END COMMENT.
