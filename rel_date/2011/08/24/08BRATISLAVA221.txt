Chief raised reftel points with the Marian Tomasik and Klara 
Novotna (Director and Deputy Director of the MFA's Middle 
East Directorate) both of whom expressed interest in 
bolstering Slovak cooperation with Iraq. Ambassador Tomasik 
noted that the GOS was intensifying diplomatic efforts to 
secure the Iraqi Government's approval of a long-stalled 
bilateral MOU on cooperation. The main elements of the MOU 
focus on military training programs, but could, according to 
Novotna, open the door to further assistance.
