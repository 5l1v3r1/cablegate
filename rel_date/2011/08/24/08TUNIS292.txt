No. 0839 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Tunisia presents 
its compliments to the Embassy of the United States of America in 
Tunis and has the honor to inform the Embassy that Tunisia has 
decided to present its candidacy for a seat at the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, for the period 
2008-2010. The elections will take place in Vienna, during the 52nd 
session of the Agency General Conference, from September 29 to 
October 3, 2008. 
 
Tunisia has been a member of the Agency since its creation in 1957. 
It has actively supported the IAEA's continuous efforts, for half a 
century, to promote technical cooperation, peaceful use of the atom, 
and nuclear safety. 
 
The predominant role of the Agency in terms of nuclear energy has 
afforded Tunisia the opportunity to accomplish projects in various 
fields such as food and nutritional safety, agriculture, medicine 
and hydrology, thus fulfilling the country's highest priorities in 
terms of development and utilization of human resources. 
 
Tunisia remains committed to the IAEA's fundamental principles, such 
as the non proliferation, disarmament and use of atomic energy 
towards peaceful purposes. 
 
Considering the excellent friendly relationship between our two 
countries, the Government of the Republic of Tunisia would be 
grateful to the Government of the United States of America for 
supporting Tunisia's candidacy. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs avails itself of this opportunity to 
renew to the Embassy of the United States of America the assurances 
of its highest consideration. 
 
Tunis, March 19th, 2008.
