¶1. (SBU) Poloff accompanied Russian and Dutch counterparts on 
April 15 to discuss the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism (GICNT) 2009 Plenary meeting in The Hague (reftel) 
with the MFA's Nineta Barbulescu, Director for Assymetric 
Threats and OSCE Affairs and Emilia Mazuru, GICNT Desk 
Officer.  Barbulescu expressed appreciation for the agenda 
and noted that the issue raised in the demarche would be 
discussed within Romania,s interagency process since it is 
likely that representation to The Hague would come from not 
only the MFA but also Interior, the National Commission for 
Control of Nuclear Activities (CNCAN), and the Romanian 
Intelligence Service (SRI), and possibly others.  She 
cautioned that the interagency meeting would need to factor 
into its decision on Romania's attendance at The Hague 
meeting the current budget situation. Barbulescu did affirm 
that GICNT is a priority for Romania. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Barbulescu noted that Romania would look closely 
into future activities, including the possibility of a 
seminar with a regional focus.  She also thought it would be 
good to draw in customs officials to participate more 
actively into the GICNT.  In terms of topics that she said 
could be of interest -- just brainstorming, she added -- the 
Prepcom for the NPT and an assessment of controls installed 
since the A.Q. Kahn scandal.  We all agreed to return for a 
more detailed reaction to the demarche after the Easter 
holiday and after the Romanian interagency consultative 
process had run its course (probably the first week of May).
