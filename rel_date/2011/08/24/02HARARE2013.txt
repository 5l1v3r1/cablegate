  ¶1.   Under headline "Zim troops return as heroes" the 
      government-controlled daily "The Herald" dedicated its 
      September 3 editorial to urging the United Nations to 
      deploy "more peacekeeping forces" into the Democratic 
      Republic of Congo (DRC) "to avoid the creation of a 
      vacuum," as Zimbabwean troops begin pulling out of that 
      country.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.    ". . .As the army (Zimbabwe National Army) begins 
      pulling out of the DRC it leaves behind a legacy of 
      military professionalism.  The new DRC army that emerges 
      after the war will no doubt try to emulate the high 
      standards set by the Zimbabweans.          . . .Zimbabwe 
      committed resources and soldiers to the DRC war and should 
      benefit economically as peace returns to the Congo. . . 
      The business opportunities would have been non-existent if 
      the army had not flown into the DRC as rebels advanced. 
      . . .Zimbabwean troops are, therefore, returning as heroes 
      who on one hand successfully defended the territorial 
      integrity and sovereignty of the DRC while on the other 
      opened a new economic frontier for the country. 
 
      ". . .Had Uganda and Rwanda's military adventures 
      and expansionist policies been successful, a 
      terrible precedent would have been set with 
      disastrous consequences for the continent.  The 
      intervention of SADC was, therefore, necessary and 
      justified.  For peace to continue to hold, it is now 
      critical that the United Nations deploys more 
      peacekeeping forces to avoid the creation of a 
      vacuum.  While the Congolese people chart the 
      political destiny of their country the UN should not 
      let them down by dragging its feet in dispatching 
      thousands of peacekeeping forces.  The peace that is 
      now being enjoyed in the Congo came at a heavy price 
      and the UN has to play its part in moving the peace 
      process forward. . . ."
