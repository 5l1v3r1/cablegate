SHARING INFORMATION ON IRANIAN EXPORT DENIALS 
 
REF: A) STATE 69315 AND B) STATE 69283 
 
¶1.  (U) On May 23, EconPolOff delivered points in reftels A 
and B to Alexander Marschik, the Acting Director of the MFA's 
Department of Arms Control, Disarmament, and 
Non-Proliferation.  Marschik attended the Nuclear Suppliers 
Group (NSG) Plenary in April 2007, and is familiar with the 
U.S. proposal on sharing export denial information on Iran 
with the IAEA, the UN Security Council's Iran Sanctions 
Committee, and other non-NSG states.  Marschik said he has 
been waiting to hear from the U.S. about the proposed 
template for sharing this information and was interested in 
what specific information the U.S. is seeking.  EconPolOff 
explained the U.S. would like states to share the name of the 
item denied, the procurement agent, and the end-user at a 
minimum, and would welcome any additional information. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Marschik asked if the U.S. planned to host a 
meeting outside of the NSG for the interested parties to 
discuss the mechanics of sharing this information. 
EconPolOff presented him with ref B's proposed agenda and 
timeline for this meeting.  The GoA plans to send 
representatives.  Marschik suggested that a representative 
from IAEA also attend the meeting to clarify (1) who the IAEA 
recipient of denial information will be and (2) how the IAEA 
plans to use this information.  Having an IAEA representative 
present to answer these questions would further help the MFA 
convince other federal ministries, reluctant business, and 
the general public that sharing such information is important 
and that the information will be used appropriately and 
confidentially.

¶3.  (SBU) In theory, Marschik said that the Austria MFA 
believes this type of information sharing on Iran would be 
useful and help facilitate the implementation of UNSCR 1747. 
However, Marschik again emphasized that the problem is 
technical and lies in the details of the sharing.  In his 
view, it is not yet clear what the level of confidentiality 
will be regarding the shared information.  Furthermore, he 
said it was unclear who in the IAEA would ultimately receive 
the report from the U.S. containing this information or how 
the IAEA would use this information. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Marschik said he will be attending the June 5 
meeting of CONOP, the EU Council's working group on nuclear 
nonproliferation.  He was certain that the U.S. information 
sharing proposal would be on the CONOP agenda.  Marschik said 
that he thought the EU would probably develop a coordinated 
policy on the issue.  In any case, Marschik thought that the 
EU Member States would arrive at the U.S.-sponsored seminar 
better prepared to discuss the issue. 
 
¶5.  (U) Post would welcome any information from Washington 
that we could share with Marschik regarding his above 
questions about the level of confidentiality and usage by the 
IAEA of this information.
