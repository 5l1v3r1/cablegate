SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - VENEZUELA'S AGREEMENT TO ASSIST BOLIVIA 
BUILD MILITARY BASES NEAR ITS BORDER 
 
¶1.  Summary:  Chile's media has reported extensively about the 
Venezuelan-Bolivian military agreement, which has generated 
considerable critical public commentary by several Congressmen. 
Government Ministers and members of the Socialist Party continue to 
downplay the military pacts.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  Press reporting on October 11 highlighted Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Ministers Alejandro Foxley and Vivianne Blanlot appearance 
yesterday with the Senate Foreign Relations and Defense Committees 
and with the Houses Foreign Affairs Committee to explain the 
government's position on the Bolivia-Venezuela Complementary 
Agreement of the Basic Technological Cooperation Agreement. 
 
¶3.  The Ministers said the government knew of the agreement since 
May.  Foxley called for calm because his ministry has been closely 
monitoring the developments regarding the agreement and would 
"continue to rigorously observe" this matter, underscoring that 
"there is absolutely no threat to Chile's security."  Blanlot said 
the agreement is "not a surprise and not grounds for special 
concern."  She said it is a "sovereign decision" for which Chile has 
no reason to intervene. 
 
¶4.  The media reported that the Ministers admitted that the 
agreement's article related to Armed Forces cooperation raises 
doubts to the true scope of the cooperation.  Specifically because 
it could pave the way for Venezuela to militarily assist Bolivia in 
an eventual conflict with a border country.  Blanlot, however, 
downplayed the concern regarding the construction of military bases: 
"these are issues that must be thoroughly discussed with Bolivia at 
the right time."  "We have at least 12 agreements that have a 
similar depth to this one, but this agreement has received an 
exceedingly alarmist connotation," said Blanlot. 
 
¶5.  Prominent Congressmen raised concerns about Venezuela's military 
cooperation pact with Bolivia.  Senator Sergio Romero (RN) warned 
that "Chile cannot remain indifferent to Venezuela's "military and 
political intervention in Bolivia."  Roberto Muoz (PPD), Chairman 
of the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee cautioned:  "The 
concerns are valid because Venezuela is "participating in a third 
country building bases that could be used on any occasion.... This 
is not humanitarian assistance, it is military strategy."  Jorge 
Tarud (PPD), Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee said: 
"No country in Latin America contributes financially to the 
construction of military bases in another nation." 
 
¶6.  For the first time, the leading dailies quoted President 
Bachelet on the Venezuela-Bolivia agreement: "We see this as a 
sovereign decision, but we assume that any decision of this kind is 
not against the interest of anyone.... The information I have at 
hand (shows the agreement) is within the norm for defense 
cooperation among countries." 
 
¶7.  On October 11, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 129,000) ran an editorial entitled, "Ambiguous 
Military Commitments" that states: 
 
"The difference in this case is the Venezuelan President's history 
of transgressions, in practice and international law, Bolivia's weak 
institutions, and its growing dependence on Venezuela....  Everyone 
expects the two presidents to explain the scope of the agreement, to 
act with transparency, and have entities verify its concrete 
application.  These are the minimum terms to bring tranquility in 
the region and for the correct understanding among governments.... 
It is in the interest of all countries involved that presidents of 
Bolivia and Venezuela clarify the scope of the agreement."
