SENSITIVE 
 
¶1.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requests the 
assistance of the Regional Security Offices in Accra, Ghana and 
Lome, Togo in support of a Human Trafficking / Forced Child Labor 
investigation involving young females trafficked to the U.S. from 
Togo and Ghana.  Three targets have been arrested in the U.S. and 
twenty-four Togolese and Ghanaian victims have been identified to 
date, eight of which are juveniles.  ICE is requesting assistance in 
locating witnesses in Ghana and Togo for eventual interview by a 
team of ICE agents in support of the prosecution of these 
defendants. 
 
¶2.  The human smugglers travel to Africa to identify and locate 
Diversity Visa (DV) lottery winners.  The traffickers then purchase 
derivative visa slots from these lottery winners, originally 
designated for the beneficiaries' children. The traffickers 
subsequently insert female impostors into those slots, who assume 
the identities of the original applicants' children.  The children 
are lured, via their parents, under the guise that they will attend 
school, learn English, and earn money to send home while in the U.S. 
 In reality, the young females are forced to work in hair salons in 
the Newark, New Jersey area and any earnings are maintained by the 
smuggling organization.  The victims ultimately never attend school 
nor remit money back home.  The organization also retains the 
victims' passports and fraudulently obtained Permanent Resident 
Cards, and severely limits contact with their families back in 
Africa. 
 
¶3.  The principal DV beneficiaries then use the money earned to pay 
for their own visa applications and travel fare to the U.S.  The 
impostor victims often travel separately from the primary DV 
beneficiaries, normally as follow-to-join aliens accompanied by one 
of the smugglers or a designee. 
 
¶4.  On September 6, 2007 the ICE Special Agent in Charge (SAC), 
Newark, New Jersey, executed three arrest warrants and five search 
warrants resulting in the recovery of twenty-four Ghanaian and 
Togolese female victims, eight of whom were juveniles.  The 
juveniles were placed into the care of several Non-Governmental 
Organizations (NGO's) in the New Jersey area.  More than $30,000 in 
cash was also seized.  The three defendants are identified as 
follows: 
 
DEFENDANT 1 
 
Akouavi KPADE AFOLABI 
DOB:  12/31/1954 
a/k/a Gloria Lawson, DOB: 12/31/1967

¶5.  Each of the victims was interviewed by ICE and the United States 
Attorney's Office (USAO) and they provided critical information 
concerning their recruitment by traffickers, via their parents, in 
Africa.  Information from the corroborating witnesses in Africa is 
necessary for the successful prosecution of these defendants. The 
USAO is currently drafting a superseding criminal indictment against 
the defendants charging them with Forced Labor, Trafficking for 
Forced Labor, Alien Smuggling, and Visa Fraud. 
 
¶6.  Pursuant to victim interviews and debriefings of arrestees, 
several potential material witnesses have been identified in Ghana 
and Togo.  The victims, and associated information, are listed 
below.  It should be noted that all of the victims were issued visas 
out of the Consular Section in Lome, and that they were issued under 
false identities.  Those identities are also provided.
