SUBJECT: Aceh to Increase Police Presence During Election 
 
¶1. (U) At the Commission on Security Arrangements (CoSA) 
meeting on November 4, representatives of the Aceh 
Monitoring Mission (AMM), Free Aceh Movement (GAM), and the 
government agreed to temporarily increase the number of 
police officers in Aceh by 2,433 above levels permitted in 
the Helsinki MOU to provide additional security during the 
election.  According to the agreement, the additional police 
will depart Aceh once a new governor has been installed. 
 
¶2. Agreement of all parties was necessary because the 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Government of 
Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement signed in Helsinki in 
August 2005 sets the maximum number of police in Aceh at 
¶9100.
