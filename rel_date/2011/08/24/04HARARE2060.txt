SUBJECT: HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE - 
USAID/OFDA FIELD VISIT TO ASSESS 
Assessment of AGRICULTURE INTERVENTIONS AND THE ON- 
GOING AGRICULTURE SEASON 
 
------------------------- 
SUMMARY 
------------------------- 
 
¶1. AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY ADVISORS FROM 
USAID/OFDA/PRETORIA AND USAID/OFDA/W VISITED 
ZIMBABWE FROM OCTOBER 23 - 29, 2004 TO MONITOR 
USAID/OFDA- FUNDED ACTIVITIES AND TO INVESTIGATE 
THE CURRENT AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SECURITY 
SITUATION IN COUNTRY. 
 
¶2. BASED ON FIELD VISITS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH 
BENEFICIARIES, IT WASIS CLEAR THAT USGTHE 
AGRICULTURE INTERVENTIONS HAVE HAD A POSITIVE 
EFFECT ON SLOWING THEHOUSEHOLD DECLINE OF 
HOUSEHOLDS INTO FOOD INSECURITY AND VULNERABILITY. 
NONETHELESS, THE DELINE IS CONTINUING IN AN 
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
CLIMATE. 
 
----------------------------- 
THE CURRENT SITUATION 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3. MOST BENEFICIARIES FORECAST A TOTAL DEPLETION 
OF PERSONAL FOOD STOCKS BY THE END OF DECEMBER. 
WITH THE WIDESPREAD ELIMINATION OF GENERAL FOOD 
AID ASSISTANCE, AND SEVERAL MONTHS REMAINING UNTIL 
HARVEST BEGINS IN APRIL 2005, THE FOOD SECURITY 
SITUATION WILL LIKELY DECLINE IN ALL REGIONS . 
 
¶4. WEATHER FORECASTS PREDICT NORMAL TO SLIGHTLY 
BELOW NORMAL PRECIPITATION FOR THE RAINY SEASON 
WITH SLIGHT REGIONAL VARIATIONS. AS TO WHETHER THE 
EARLY OR LATE PART OF THE RAINY SEASON WILL BE 
NORMAL. 
 
¶5. ADDITIONALLY, A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THE 
POPULATION MAY BECOME MOBILE (RURAL TO URBAN 
MIGRATION) TO COPE WITH INCREASING VULNERABILITY 
AND AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUING DISSOLVING OF 
COMMERCIAL  FARMS THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF 
ZIMBABWE'S (GOZ) LAND REFORM PROGRAM WHICH IS 
RESULTING IN AGRICULTURAL LABORERS BEING REMOVED 
FROM LARGE FARMS.

FIELD VISITS

¶6. THE USAID/OFDA, USAID/ZIMBABWE TEAM OBSERVED 
AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED BY 
DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATES INCORPORATED (DAI), WORLD 
VISION, AFRICARE, AND CARE IN BULAWAYO, GWERU, 
SHURUGWI AND MASVINGO AREAS.  THE TEAM ALSO VISTED 
THE ICRISAT CENTER IN BULAWAYO. 
 
 
 
-------------------------- 
SEED ISSUES 
-------------------------- 
 
¶76. NGO'S INVOLVED IN SEED PROCUREMENT AND 
DISTRIBUTION ARE FACED WITH A CONTINUALLY CHANGING 
AND VAGUE SET OF RULES FOR SEED PURCHASE AND 
DISTRIBUTION.  GOZTHEY ARE NOW INSTRUCTED THEMBY 
GOZ TO IMPORT SEEDS RATHER THAN TO PURCHASE 
LOCALLY., AND MAY BE BARRED FROM DISTRIBUTING 
CERTAIN LOCALLY-PRODUCED SEED STOCKS EVEN IF SEEDS 
WERE PRODUCED THROUGH NGO-IMPLEMENTED LOCAL 
MULTIPLICATION SCHEMES.  IN MANY DISTRICTS 
UNCERTIAINTY SURROUNDEDS THE HOLDING OF SEED FAIRS 
BY NGOS BECAUSE OF THE ILL- DEFINED POSITION OF 
THE GOVERNMENT IN RELATION TO NGO SEED 
DISTRIBUTION IN ANY FORM.  EVENTUALLY SOME SEED 
FAIRS DID TAKE PLACE.   IN MASVINGO, NGOS STILL DO 
NOT HAVE THE GO-AHEAD FROM THE GOZ TO START SEED 
DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES. RECENTLY THE GOZ STARTED 
ENFORCING SEED IMPORT CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 
THAT HAD BEEN LOOSELY APPLIED DURING THE PREVIOUS 
TWO YEARS.  THE SUDDEN STRICT APPLICATIONS OF THE 
REGULATIONS CAAME WITHOUT WARNING AND AT A TIME 
WHEN MANY NGO'S WEARE READY TO BEGIN DISTRIBUTION. 
THIS MAY DELAYED SEED DISTRIBUTION. , THEREBY 
FURTHER DELAYING THE PLANTING DATE FOR LOCAL 
FARMERS AND REDUCING POTENTIAL YIELDS. THE MAIN 
PLANTING SEASON COMES TO AN END IN JANUARY. 
 
¶87. SEED ACCESS FOR MOST SMALL FARMERS IS LIMITED. 
THE GOZ HAS PURCHASED MOST OF THE AVAILABLE MAIZE 
SEED IN COUNTRY AND PLANSS TO DISTRIBUTE IT 
THROUGH THE GRAIN MARKETING BOARD (GMB) AND THE 
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
(ARDA)),.  WHETHER SEED WILL ACTUALLY REACH THE 
MOST VULNERABLE THROUGH THIS PROCESS REMAINS TO BE 
SEEN.  SOME FARMERS ARE OBTAINING MAIZE IN THIS 
MANNER, BUT THE CONDITIONS FOR ACCESSING THE SEED 
ARE NOT CLEAR.  THE GOZ HAS CONTACTED AT LEAST ONE 
NGO TO DISCUSS COLLABORATING ON MAIZE SEED 
DISTRIBUTION, BUT THE TERMS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP 
REMAIN UNCLEAR. 
 
¶98. LEGUME SEEDSS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY WITHIN THE 
COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY GROUNDNUTS.  STRAPPED WITH LOW 
FOOD SUPPLIES, SCHOOL FEE INCREASES AND RAPIDLY 
ESCALATING PRICES DUE TO INFLATION, MANY FARMERS 
ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND WAYS TO AFFORD OR OBTAIN 
SEEDS, FERTILIZER AND DRAUGHT POWER. 
 
¶1098. THE PLANTING OF CASSAVA AND IMPROVED SWEET 
POTATO HAS BEEN ENCOURAGED IN DRY AREAS OF THE 
COUNTRY BY THE NGOS AND AREX, THE AG EXTENSION 
OFFICE OF ZIMBABWE, AS A MEANS TO HELP FARMERS 
SPAN THE HUNGRY SEASON.  TRAINING FOR PREPARATION 
AND UTILIZATION OF SWEET POTATO AND CASSAVA WAS 
WELL RECEIVED BY THE BENEFICIARIES.

FIELD VISITS

¶109. THE USAID/OFDA, USAID/ZIMBABWE TEAM OBSERVED 
AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED BY 
DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATES INCORPORATED (DAI), WORLD 
VISION, AFRICARE, AND CARE IN BULAWAYOAYO, GWERU, 
SHURUGWI AND MASVINGO AREAS.  THE TEAM ALSO VISTED 
THE ICRISAT CENTER IN BULAWAYO. 
 
¶110. THE LINKAGES FOR THE ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT OF 
THE DISADVANTAGED (LEAD) ACTIVITY, MANAGED BY DAI, 
PROVIDES FOOD INSECURE FAMILIES WITH SIMPLE, LOW- 
COST DRIP IRRIGATION KITS AND VEGETABLE SEEDS TO 
DEVELOP HOUSEHOLD NUTRITION GARDENS.  LEAD HAS 
ESTABLISHED 23,355 HOUSEHOLD NUTRITION GARDENS 
USING LOW-COST DRIP IRRIGATION IN 53 DISTRICTS OF 
ZIMBABWE.  IN MATABELAND SOUTH, BENEFICIARIES 
INDICATED THAT THE DRIP IRRIGATION HAS ALLOWED 
MANY OF THEM TO AFFORD SCHOOL FEES AND HAS 
PROVIDED A GREAT SURGE IN DIETARY DIVERSITY AND 
NUTRITION.  IN MANY OF THE AREAS WITH DRIP 
IRRIGATION, FARMERS ARE SELLING THEIR PRODUCE 
INDIVIDUALLY ON SITE AND IN LOCAL MARKETS. 
 
¶121. WORLD VISION INTERNATIONAL (WVI) - WVI IS 
ALSO USING SEED DISTRIBUTION AND DRIP IRRIGATION 
TO BENEFIT FARMERS. THE MOST VULNERABLE FARMERS 
AREARE SCHEDULED TO RECEIVE CUTTINGS OF CASSAVA 
AND SWEET POTATO FROM THE FIRST GROUP OF 
BENEFICIARIES, ONCE PLANTS FROM THIS ROUND OF 
CUTTINGS ARE ESTABLISHED, 7 - 9 MONTHS FROM NOW. 
AT THE TIME OF THE VISIT, CONDITIONS IN INSIZA 
DISTRICT WERETHIS REGION ARE CURRENTLY EXTREMELY 
DRY WITH LITTLE EVIDENCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF PRE- 
RAINY SEASON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION WITHOUT SMALL 
SCALE IRRIGATION (DRIP KITS) OR OTHER MEANS OF 
WATERING.  SHALLOW WELLS WEARE ALREADY STARTING TO 
DRY UP IN MANY AREAS.  THE TEAM ALSO VISITED AWVI 
ALSO MANAGES AN OFDA-FUNDED CHICKEN AND GOAT 
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO AID VERY VULNERABLE 
HOUSEHOLDHS WITH REDUCED LABOR TO IMPROVE THE 
QUALITY OF THEIR DIETS THROUGH INCREASED PROTIEN 
AND TO ENHANCE THEIR COPING OPTIONS. 
 
¶132. AFRICARE - SHURUGWI DISTRICT.  AFRICARE IS 
CURRENTLY MULTIPLYING OPEN POLLINATED VARIETIES 
(OPV) OF MAIZE SEED AND CASSAVA AND SWEET POTATO 
CUTTINGS, IN MANY CASES USING DRIP IRRIGATION. 
THEY ARE ALSO COORDINATING AGROPROCESSING GROUPS 
FOR PRODUCTION OF PEANUT BUTTER AND SUNFLOWER OIL. 
ALTHOUGH THE GROUPS ARE NOT SELF SUSTAINING YET, 
THEY SHOW GREAT PROMISE AND ALSO PROVIDE AN ADDED 
SOURCE OF NUTRITION AND INCOME.  THE MOST 
VULNERABLE ARE SAID TO BENEFIT THROUGH SHARING OF 
20% OF THE AMOUNT OF OIL AND PEANUT BUTTER 
PRODUCED. 
 
¶143. CARE ZIMBABWE - OFDA FUNDING TO CARE ASSISTED 
149,000 FARMING HOUSEHOLDS IN THE 10 DISTRICTS OF 
MIDLANDS AND MASVINGO PROVINCES.  525 MT OF SUGAR 
BEAN AND 75 MT OF GROUNDNUT SEED WERE DISTRIBUTED. 
CARE IS MULTIPLIEDYING OPV (OPEN POLLINATED 
VARIETY) MAIZE SEED WITH DRIP IRRIGATION IN THE 
WINTER MONTHS FOR DEPOSIT AND REDISTRIBUTION 
THROUGH A COMMUNITY SEED BANK.  THIS INNOVATIVE 
APPROACH IS MINIMIZEDING CROSS-POLLINATION 
CONTAMINATION OF SEED BY AVOIDING SEED 
MULTIPLICATION DURING THE NORMAL MAIZE GROWING 
PERIOD. 
 
----------------------- 
COMMENTS 
----------------------- 
 
¶154. THE USG EFFORTS HAVE HELPED AMELIORATE FOOD 
INSECURITY.  THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF DRIP 
IRRIGATION KITS IN TARGET AREAS HAS CONTRIBUTED 
VEGETABLES FOR HOME CONSUMPTION AND IMPROVED FOOD 
SECURITY.  HOWEVER, IF THE INTENT IS TO ALLOW 
FARMERS TO EARN INCOME THROUGH PRODUCE SALES, THE 
DIVERSIFICATION OF PRODUCE, AND INSTRUCTION ON 
PROCESSING VEGETABLES AND LEGUMES INTO VALUE ADDED 
ITEMS, CSHOULD BE ADDED TO DRIP KIT PROGRAMMING TO 
ENHANCE INCOME GENERATION.  THIS WOULDILL 
FACILITATE HOUSEHOLDS BEING ABLE TO EARN INCOME 
FOROM PRODUCE MARKETING IN ADDITION TO THE 
NUTRITIONAL AND FOOD SECURITY BENEFITS THEY 
ALREADY RECEIVE. 
 
¶165. HOWEVER, THE SCARCITY OF SEEDS IS HIGH, AND 
FARMER DEMAND, ESPECIALLY FOR SUCH SEEDS AS 
GROUNDNUTS, HAS BEEN EVIDENT. IF FUTURE OFDA FUNDS 
ARE USED FOR SEED MULTIPLICATION, WHERE 
APPROPRIATE, MULTIPLICATION OF GROUNDNUT SEEDS 
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. 
 
¶176. FINALLY, THE SITUATION WILL NEED TO BE 
CLOSELY MONITORED AS THE LEAN MONTHS CONTINUE.  IF 
SEED DISTRIBUTION IS DELAYED, THE FOOD GAP WILL BE 
INCREASED AND THE SITUATION IS LIKELY TO 
DETERIORATE FURTHER.  USAID/OFDA AND THE MISSION 
WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AND RESPOND 
APPROPRIATELY AS NEEDED.
