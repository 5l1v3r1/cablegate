¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered reftel points on the Goldstone Report and 
debate at the UN General Assembly to Loukas Tsokos of the Greek 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs D1 Directorate for International 
Organizations and Stelios Gavriil of the A6 Directorate for Middle 
East Affairs.  Counselor Gavriil thanked PolOff for sharing the USG 
position on this matter and expressed concurrence with many of the 
points raised.  In particular he concurred with USG concerns that 
the Middle East Peace Process not be derailed.  Gavriil promised to 
communicate our position to the Greek PermRep to the United Nations 
in New York and noted that EU Member States would be meeting the 
morning (EST) of November 4th to discuss a common position. 
Gavriil said that Greece would follow EU consensus on this matter, 
which he anticipated would be a "quite neutral" position in regard 
to the Goldstone report, UN General Assembly debate and proposed 
resolution. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Gavriil also raised concern that Secretary Clinton's 
recent statements on Israeli settlements were "back-tracking" from 
what had previously been said and were "unfair" to the Palestinian 
side.  PolOff referred Gavriil to Secretary Clinton's November 2 
remarks on the issue (in Marrakesh), which reiterated the USG 
position on settlements and explained her rationale in light of 
recent developments.
