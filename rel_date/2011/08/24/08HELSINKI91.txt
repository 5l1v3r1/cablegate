(SBU) PolChief delivered reftel demarche Feb. 25 to 
Claus-Jerker Lindroos, Counselor for Somalia in the Finnish 
MFA's Unit for Africa.  On March 2, Lindroos contacted us to 
offer the following response: 
 
-- Regarding the question of interdicting piracy off the 
Somali coast, Lindroos said that the GoF understands the 
seriousness of the problem and supports multilateral 
operations to stem it.  However, the limited resources of the 
Finnish armed forces would make it "very unlikely" that 
Finland would be able to offer naval assets for participation 
in such an effort. 
 
-- As for a possible UN initiative, Lindroos noted that 
"Finland would look favorably" on a UN resolution that 
included authorization to conduct multilateral naval 
operations in Somali territorial waters to combat piracy.  He 
added that the GoF fully shares the US view that such a 
resolution must be based on a Somali TFG request and include 
its active participation.
