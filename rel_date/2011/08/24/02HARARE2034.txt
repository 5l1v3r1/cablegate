BLOCKING OPPOSITION'S FOOD RELIEF EFFORT 
 
 
  ¶1.   Opposition MDC party efforts, thus far in vain, to 
      bring donated food into Zimbabwe have begun to generate 
      media attention.  The independent "Daily News" dedicated 
      its September 5 editorial to the issue.  Under the title 
      "Let food roll in without the import papers" the editorial 
      says in part: 
 
  ¶2.   "Zimbabwe is facing its severest crisis in living 
      memory.  Millions are violently exposed to hunger 
      and famine, political uncertainty, economic ruin and 
      total insecurity. . .  The crisis is so overwhelming 
      the government no longer has the capacity to contain 
      it.  The latest seizure of grain, sourced by the 
      opposition MDC party to lessen the impact of the 
      catastrophe, is a criminal act, considering the 
      severity of poverty on the ground.  To insist on a 
      permit for an essential commodity, meant as a free 
      handout to save a life, shows unimaginable 
      callousness.  Today's hand-to-mouth situation is an 
      unsustainable recipe for political unrest. . .  Any 
      concerned person wishing to help Zimbabwe must turn 
      up at any border post with whatever quantity of 
      maize they can obtain.  Let (Agriculture Minister) 
      Made impound it, if he thinks it's the best way to 
      fend off the threat of death from starvation."
