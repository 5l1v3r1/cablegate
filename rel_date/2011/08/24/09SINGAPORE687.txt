AFGHAN-FOCUSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
 
REF: SECSTATE 74362 
 
(SBU) Acting EP Counselor delivered reftel demarche, urging 
Singapore to consider enhancing its contributions to 
Afghanistan following the August 20 Afghan presidential 
elections, to MFA Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia 
Deputy Director Stephen Lim in a July 20 meeting.  Lim 
thanked us for the demarche and highlighted Singapore's 
ongoing effort to assist Afghanistan's civil development 
through MFA's Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP).  In 
recent years, the GOS has allocated 1.2 million SGD (800,000 
USD) to the SCP for a variety of capacity building training 
programs specifically focused on the provision of training 
for Afghan officials, Lim said.  The training programs all 
take place in Singapore, and cover topics ranging from good 
governance and anti-corruption to rule of law and security 
training.  The programs typically last up to two weeks and 
involve multiple Singapore government agencies.  Lim said the 
program works in conjunction with programs set up by other 
governments or non-governmental organizations.  Lim noted 
that the Singapore has provided training for Afghan officials 
through joint programs with other ISAF members and also with 
NGOs such as the Asia Foundation.  Lim said Singapore would 
welcome similar cooperation with the United States on 
Afghan-focused programs.  Lim noted that Singapore desires to 
run these programs within Singapore and does not intend to 
provide "on-the-ground" civil-based training in Afghanistan.
