SUBJECT:  UAE TO REQUIRE VISAS FOR DIPLOMATIC AND OFFICIAL TRAVELERS 
FROM OCTOBER 1, 2009 
 
¶1. THIS CABLE CONTAINS AN ACTION REQUEST IN PARA 5. 
 
¶2. On May 18, 2009, Ambassador, accompanied by Conchief, was 
summoned to meet with UAE MFA Director for Consular Affairs 
Ambassador Sultan Mohammed Al Qortasi. Al Qortasi provided a 
diplomatic note announcing that, effective October 1, 2009, the UAEG 
will require persons traveling on diplomatic and official passports 
to obtain visas before travel to the UAE. (Note: The UAE currently 
allows private and official Americans visa-free entry to the UAE for 
stays of up to 30 days. There has been no change announced for 
persons traveling on regular passports. End Note.) 
 
¶3. Al Qortasi explained that MFA and Ministry of Interior (MOI) are 
still discussing implementation details, and said that the UAEG 
welcomes USG comments and feedback on this change. Ambassador 
expressed hope that multiple entry visas would be routinely issued, 
and pointed out that many USG officials frequently travel 
to/thorough the UAE, making particular note of USG personnel 
transiting to/from Afghanistan. He presented this extensive travel 
as mutually beneficial, pointing out the UAE regional interests 
served by US engagement, as well as the financial benefit to the UAE 
(hotels, air travel, etc.) Ambassador also highlighted the 
occasional need for large-scale personnel movements with little or 
no advance notice, using the example of departure status at a 
regional post. Al Qortasi said that the latter could be "handled on 
a case by case basis." Al Qortasi said that feedback and input on 
this policy change should be provided to him or via the UAE 
Ambassador in Washington. 
 
¶4. The Canadian Embassy in Abu Dhabi has also received notification 
of this change.  In response, the GOC has set up a team to look at 
the possibility of allowing visa-free travel to Canada for UAE 
nationals in an effort to encourage a reciprocal UAE policy for 
Canadians. The team is due to arrive in Abu Dhabi in late May, and 
post expects to meet with them during their visit. 
 
¶5. COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST: As the UAEG is several months away 
from implementation and has solicited our input, post requests 
Department (and other missions') guidance on specific policies that 
would be helpful or damaging to USG interests.  END COMMENT AND 
ACTION REQUEST.
