POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
HURRIYET / RADIKAL / SABAH:     Ankara Security Directorate (ASD), 
after examining the statements made, slogans chanted, banners 
and posters waved at Sunday's DTP congress, finalized its probe 
into the congress and filed a complaint with the Ankara Chief 
Prosecutor on grounds that people made propaganda of PKK during 
the congress.  Prosecutor's Office solicited the text of the 
speeches of National Chairperson Ahmet Turk and former 
co-chairperson Aysel Tugluk made at the congress and the footage 
taken by ASD upon receiving the complaint. If Prosecutor's 
Office finds out that Political Parties Act has been breached 
during the congress, it will file an investigation against DTP 
which might pave the way for a court action that demands the 
closure of DTP. (This summary is from 06/27 editions.)
