¶1. (SBU) Summary: Construction to raise the Roseries Dam in Blue 
Nile State by ten meters threatens to displace between 21,000 and 
73,000 people in Blue Nile State, according to Oxford University 
researcher Harry Verhoeven.  At a September 8 briefing to a small 
group of UN donors and representatives, Verhoeven stated that 
government officials have not adequately informed affected residents 
about the project's impact or set aside funds for compensation. 
According to Verhoeven, Blue Nile State Governor Malik Ajar opposes 
the project, and will do all he can to ensure the best deal possible 
for displaced persons. End Summary.

ROSERIES DAM TO BE RAISED BY 10 METERS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) In 2008, construction began to heighten by ten meters the 
Roseries Dam in Blue Nile State.  The cost of construction is 
approximately USD 400 million.  The higher dam would allow Sudan to 
store additional water and to use the entire volume of Nile waters 
allocated to Sudan under the 1959 Nile Agreement. 
 
¶3.  (U) The construction project goals include decreasing Sudan's 
dependence on oil revenue, expanding irrigation to decrease rainfall 
dependency, and generating electricity.  The project is part of a 
wider hydraulic effort encompassing construction or rehabilitation 
of up to 10 dams countrywide, many of them along the Nile.  The 
Roseries Dam project is scheduled for completion in late 2010.

HIGHER DAM WILL DISPLACE 21-73,000 PERSONS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) New dam construction will flood a large area, displacing 
between 21,000 and 73,000 people depending on the computer model 
used, according to Verhoeven, who briefed U.S. and UN staff on 
September 8.  According to Verhoeven, affected populations have not 
been adequately informed of the impact of the dam construction or 
compensation for dislocation and lost assets.  Verhoeven stated that 
residents reported attending one community meeting and rapidly 
registering assets the following day.  Officials have not given 
residents the opportunity to revise asset lists or submit 
grievances. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Villages affected by the Roseries Dam project house 
minority populations, including Hausa, Fellata, and Funj.  These 
villages are remote, have high poverty levels, receive limited 
government services, and are minimally engaged with Blue Nile State 
authorities. According to Verhoeven, Governor Malik Ajar says that 
if compensation for the dam project were paid completely, the cost 
would be greater than the construction cost. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In order to accommodate displacements, the Government of 
National Unity has planned to construct seven towns on the west side 
of the river and six on the east side.  According to Verhoeven, 
villagers in affected areas expressed concern to him regarding 
potential grouping with other tribes. According to Verhoeven, some 
affected people he interviewed stated that if they are not properly 
involved in the process and compensated, they will switch their 
loyalty from the National Congress Party (NCP) to the Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement (SPLM). 
 
¶7. (SBU) The Dam Implementation Unit, which reports directly to the 
President, is responsible for the implementation of dam projects 
including Roseries.  According to Verhoeven, the unit is composed 
almost exclusively of engineers from within the NCP.  Verhoeven 
further noted that the dam construction project is ignoring 
environmental considerations, although a UN official attending the 
briefing challenged this view, mentioning that engineers have 
engaged in discussions about environmental impacts with key 
investors including the Chinese and Kuwaitis, and that some western 
donors are also privy to the environmental plans. 
 
¶8. (SBU) In Blue Nile State, Verhoeven said, in addition to plans to 
move up to 73,000 people for the dam construction, the federal 
government has plans to move up to 250,000 people to make way for 
irrigated agricultural land.  Malik Ajar, governor of the province, 
told the researcher that he was completely opposed to the Roseries 
project, but that he had to "pick his battles."  The governor said 
his strategy will be to try to ensure the best deal possible for the 
displaced people. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Comment: Construction of the Meroe dam in northern Sudan 
 
KHARTOUM 00001045  002 OF 002 
 
 
prompted violent civil protests over displacement and compensation. 
The central government has reason to oversee this project with 
vigilance given the potential for unrest and Blue Nile State's right 
to popular consultations in connection with the 2011 Referendum on 
independence for the South.  According to a UN participant at the 
briefing, the worst scenario for the NCP would be for Blue Nile 
State to choose to separate with the South.  Any potential outcome 
that complicates the implementation of the Nile Water Agreement of 
1959, to which Sudan is a signatory, or jeopardizes Sudan's access 
to water, will be closely watched in Khartoum.  End Comment.
