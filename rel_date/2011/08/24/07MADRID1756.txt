SUBJECT: SPAIN WOULD LIKE MORE INFO ON STANDING COMMISSION 
CANDIDATE 
 
REF: STATE 102873 
 
Poloff spoke with Spanish Ambassador for Humanitarian Affairs 
Maria Bassols on September 10 regarding the candidacy of 
Steve Carr for the Standing Commission of the International 
Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  Bassols said that she 
was familiar with Carr's candidacy and was impressed by his 
credentials, but she said that Spain had not yet made a 
decision regarding its support.  She expressed surprise that 
more candidates had not yet emerged for the position. 
Bassols asked Poloff whether Mr. Carr had issued or planned 
to issue a paper on his views of the future of the 
International Red Cross, and Poloff promised to seek more 
information and follow up.
