¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Fighting between members of the armed opposition 
group Sudan Liberation Army/Abdul Wahid (SLA/AW) and the Sudanese 
Armed Forces (SAF) in Jebel Marra, an area transecting all three 
Darfur states, remains ongoing and has extended to the SLA/AW 
stronghold of Deribat, according to humanitarian sources.  However, 
the full scale and scope of fighting remain unknown due to lack of 
access to affected areas. On February 25, the Acting UN 
Humanitarian Coordinator hosted a high-level donors meeting to 
share information regarding the humanitarian situation in Jebel 
Marra and to commence discussions regarding possible response 
strategies.  The number of people affected remains unknown and 
relief agencies continue to plan for humanitarian needs assessments 
and response activities pending access to affected populations. End 
Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
RECENT CONFLICT IN JEBEL MARRA 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Humanitarian organizations report that between February 10 
and 25 fighting occurred between SAF and members of the armed 
opposition group SLA/AW in Kara, Leiba, Fugoli, Feina, Kidingeer 
and Deribat towns in the eastern Jebel Marra area of Darfur 
resulting in an unknown number of casualties.  Relief agencies 
indicate that fighting continues in Deribat, and that affected 
areas remain unstable due to a pattern of continued attacks and 
attempts to regain control of affected areas.  According to the UN, 
combatants had conducted attacks by land; however, February 25 
reports indicate the possibility of broadened military tactics 
including the use of SAF aircraft and helicopters gunships. 
 
¶3. On February 24, UN sources received reports of an imminent SAF 
attack on SLA/AW forces in Deribat, also indicating that local 
people had fled the village. (Note: Deribat serves as a de facto 
civil administration and sometime military headquarters for SLA/AW 
in the "liberated zone" of East Jebel Marra. Special Envoy Gration 
visited Deribat in April 2009 (ref C). End Note.) At noon, SAF 
forces reportedly entered the abandoned village and allegedly 
looted, burned, and destroyed structures including water sources. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Conflict also occurred among SLA/AW factions in the 
western Jebel Marra area of Darfur between late December 2009 and 
early February 2010 resulting in an unknown number of internally 
displaced persons (IDP).  IDP leaders and Sudanese government 
authorities reported that fighting had resulted in approximately 
35,000 displaced people; however, humanitarian agencies have been 
unable to independently verify this figure.  UN agencies have 
commenced response activities in areas where relief agencies can 
access IDPs and plan to expand response activities pending access 
to affected areas and verification of displacement. 
 
---------------------- 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION 
---------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU). During the February 25 meeting, the UN reported that the 
number of people killed, injured, and displaced by ongoing fighting 
remains unknown.  The UN stated that between 100,000 and 120,000 
people reside in eastern Jebel Marra where fighting continues.  The 
UN suggested that Deribat will likely experience the greatest 
population displacement due to the intensity of attacks reported in 
the area.  Humanitarian agencies raise concern that populations 
that have reportedly fled into the hill areas of Jebel Marra may 
become trapped by continued fighting and will remain inaccessible 
to  relief agencies. 
 
¶6. (SBU).  According to the UN and humanitarian partners, fighting 
has resulted in looting of relief agency offices, residences, and 
facilities, including health clinics and water distribution points. 
In addition, combatants have reportedly seized health assets in 
particular, resulting in a possible shortage of health supplies for 
affected populations.

---------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) The UN plans to conduct an interagency assessment mission 
to the affected areas of eastern Jebel Marra during the first week 
of March.  However, the UN remains concerned regarding lack of 
access due to ongoing fighting, particularly in Deribat.  The 
humanitarian community continues to endeavor to gain access to 
affected areas noting a requirement for high-level coordination 
given that fighting has affected populations in all three Darfur 
states.  In addition, the UN noted that the situation may require 
increased advocacy to obtain a cease-fire for the purpose of 
developing a humanitarian corridor. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The UN noted that access to affected populations is 
additionally reduced by the diminishing presence of humanitarian 
staff in areas of conflict.  On February 11, the UN relocated 27 
humanitarian staff members by air from Feina, Deribat, and 
Kidingeer to Nyala, South Darfur due to continued fighting, further 
reducing field staff presence and access to affected populations. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Comment:  The UN expressed concern that the loss of SLA/AW 
control in some areas may result in continued and increasing 
displacement due to the local population's loyalty to SLA/AW.  End 
comment.
