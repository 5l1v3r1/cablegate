POLITICAL PROCESS IN IRAQ 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Syrian Assistant FM Ahmad Arnous said after the 
Baghdad Conference on March 10 that the Iraqi government and 
the international community should shoulder their 
responsibility in alleviating the suffering of the displaced 
Iraqis, according to the official Syrian Arab News Agency 
(SANA).  Arnous reiterated Syria,s commitment to a secure 
and stable Iraq, saying, &Syria backs a political solution 
that leads to returning security and stability to Iraq and 
establishment of a new Iraq of an Arab and Islamic 
identity,8 according to local press reports.  Arnous, 
statement also urged Iraq,s neighbors to work together on 
greater border security.  Official Syrian media generally 
highlighted the Baghdad Conference as an &opportunity8 and 
described it as &pivotal8 to the future of Iraq and the 
region.  Syrian officials stressed in official media that 
Syria and Iran participated in the conference not due to 
&American or international pressure,8 but out of a desire 
by Syria and Iran to support &the political option for 
resolving the crisis in Iraq.8 
 
¶2. (SBU) Journalist Samir al-Shibani opined in 
government-owned daily Tishreen on March 10 that the success 
of the Baghdad Conference depends on US intentions.  He 
added, &It goes without saying that the American occupation 
is the reason behind every problem threatening Iraq now.8 
On March 11, Tishreen ran an opinion piece in which author 
Muhiddin Mohammad claimed that the inclusion of Syria and 
Iran in the conference reflects the US failure to resolve the 
Iraqi conflict via military means, that Iran and Syria 
participated out of a desire to find a political solution to 
the Iraq conflict, and that the conference represents a 
change in US strategy regarding Iraq.
