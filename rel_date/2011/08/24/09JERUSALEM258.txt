SUBJECT: GUNMEN STEAL UNRWA TRUCKS; UNRWA SUSPENDS ALL 
SHIPMENTS TO GAZA 
 
¶1. (SBU) Transport contacts reported to EconOff late February 
5 that gunmen connected to Hamas seized eleven truckloads of 
Arab donations containing rice and flour intended for UNRWA. 
The trucks had entered Israel from the Nizzana/al-Aouja 
border crossing with Egypt and then passed through Kerem 
Shalom into Gaza.  The contacts reported that truckers 
connected to Hamas warned UNRWA-contracted truckers waiting 
to pick up the shipments at the Kerem Shalom crossing to 
"leave the Arab donations for us to pick up -- or we will 
break your hands and feet." 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 6, UNRWA/Gaza Director John Ging 
initially denied but later confirmed that ten trucks were 
taken. Ging said that he has suspended all UNRWA shipments to 
Gaza until the missing supplies are recovered and UNRWA 
receives "assurances from the Hamas government in Gaza that 
there will be no repeat of these thefts." 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNRWA issued an immediate press release confirming 
the suspension of aid shipments to Gaza.  Ging also told 
RefCoord that he has suspended UNRWA/Gaza's Deputy Logistics 
Officer, who was present at Kerem Shalom yesterday and had 
confirmed receipt of all supplies February 5, pending an 
investigation.
