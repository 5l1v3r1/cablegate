SUBJECT:  EARTHQUAKE IN WEST SUMATRA: SITREP 1 
 
1.The following information is current as of 16:00 local time. 
 
¶2. Padang, West Sumatra was hit by a 7.6 earthquake the evening of 
September 30.  The epicenter of the quake was located 30 miles 
west/northwest of Padang.  The affected communities include Padang, 
population in excess of 900,000 and Pariaman, population in excess 
of 90,000. A second earthquake followed at 17:38 hours near Jambi in 
east Sumatra. President Yudhoyono who, visited Padang with six 
ministers, estimates that this earthquake could cause more damage 
and loss of life than that that occurred near Yogyakarta, Java in 
2006, when over 5,000 people were killed. 
 
DEATHS AND INJURIES - ALL AMCITS ACCOUNTED FOR 
 
¶3.  The Ministry of Social Affairs has confirmed 465 dead, 168 
injured principally in Pariaman and Padang.  Experts expect the toll 
to rise over 1,000.  All known American citizens in the area are 
accounted for. 
 
SERVICES 
 
¶4.  Although most of Sumatra still has power, four transformers are 
down but the Padang and Pariaman districts have been hard hit.  Gas 
stations are running out of fuel, and consequently many generators 
are out of use.  There is still access to clean water but many pipes 
are broken.  The four primary hospitals, all of which have 
collapsed, have sent up tents in order to treat patients. 
 
ASSISTANCE: REQUESTED AND U.S. RESPONSE 
 
¶5.  The Indonesia Government announced that while it had control of 
the situation it welcomed assistance from friendly nations.  The 
Embassy has requested USD300,000 in early response disaster 
assistance.  The funding will be used primarily to support emergency 
distributions of non-food items.  Additionally, the Embassy has sent 
a small assessment team to the area to ascertain the condition of 
U.S. citizens and the extent of the damage to the area.  Post will 
continue to seek ways to assist. 
 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
 
¶6.  Japan has dispatched a 66 person emergency rescue team with 
three dogs, a 23 person medical team and an unidentified number of 
earthquake damage assessment specialists.  An international donor's 
meeting was convened late today by the UN and we expect to learn 
that additional assistance will be provided. 
 
MISSION'S RESPONSE 
 
¶7. Charge has established a crisis response team. In addition to 
requesting USD300,000 in assistance, Post has also requested that a 
DART be sent.  Embassy Jakarta dispatched two 4WD vehicles with 
supplies, including trauma kits.  Additionally we have sent a team 
of six, officers from DOJ and CONS, to conduct an on-the-ground 
assessment.  Point of contact is Joshua Finch who can be reached at
