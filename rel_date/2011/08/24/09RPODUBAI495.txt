¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The following contains November 16-17 
nuclear-related statements as reported in the Iranian press by: 
 
 
 
¶A. IRIG IAEA Rep Soltanieh: 'Fordo Inspection Confirms Iran's 
Information' 
 
¶B. Head of Majlis Foreign Relations Subcommittee of the National 
Security Committee: 'Iran Isn't Going to Swap Fuel' 
 
¶C.  IAEA Director El-Baradei: 'Inspection Confirms Iran's 
Honesty' (IRNA) 
 
¶D. Ayandenews: 'Export of Iranian Fuel is Red Line' 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) IRIG OFFICIAL COMMENTS: 
 
 
 
¶A. IRIG IAEA REP SOLTANIEH: 'FORDO INSPECTION CONFIRMS IRAN'S 
INFORMATION' (ISNA, NOV 16) 
 
 
 
Title: Soltanieh to ISNA: "Iran Won't Implement Additional 
Protocol and Code 3.1.  The IAEA Inspection Results of Fordo 
Conform to the Information Provided by Iran" 
 
 
 
Summary: In this story Soltanieh is quoted as saying: 
 
 
 
-  [Re November IAEA report]: IAEA inspection results conform to 
all the information provided by Iran concerning Fordo. 
 
- This IAEA report, like the previous normal and repetitive 
ones, again concerns itself with the normal process of 
inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. 
 
 
 
- [Noting that the only difference with this report is that it 
contains a report on the inspectors' inspection of Iran's second 
enrichment site (Fordo)]: It was announced in this report that 
there were inspections of Iran's second enrichment site and the 
results of these inspections clearly indicate that all the 
information Iran provided corresponds with the inspection 
results and that there is no centrifuge installed in this 
facility and nuclear material isn't being used in it. 
 
 
 
- Re Fordo, we pointed out that to due to the continuation of 
threats against Iran's nuclear centers, Iran had no option but 
to establish another enrichment center besides Natanz. 
 
 
 
- This report shows that the propaganda and political 
hullaballoo about Fordo after Iran's voluntary announcement to 
the IAEA is totally baseless. 
 
 
 
- As has been said repeatedly, Iran in no way will end its 
peaceful nuclear activities to include enrichment~ Iran will 
continue its transparent cooperation with the IAEA and this 
latest report is another document from this nuclear watchdog 
that announces that all of Iran's nuclear activities are within 
a peaceful framework and under the supervision of the IAEA. 
 
 
 
- [ Re El-Baradei's emphasis in the report on Iran's 
implementing the Additional Protocol and the Code 3.1 of the 
Subsidiary Arrangements]:  This sentence is repetitive and was 
in all the previous reports.  After Iran's technical and 
specialized nuclear issues were referred to the Security 
Council, without any technical or legal considerations, the 
Majlis instructed the Government to cease implementing the 
 
DUBAI 00000495  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
Additional Protocol and the 3.1 Code.  Iran continues to 
cooperate with the IAEA based on the NPT and carries out all its 
activities under IAEA supervision. 
 
 
 
¶B. HEAD OF MAJLIS FOREIGN RELATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY COMMITTEE: IRAN ISN'T GOING TO SWAP FUEL (November 16, 
Mehr News) 
 
 
 
Summary: Hojjatoleslam Hossein Ebrahimi, Head of Majlis Foreign 
Relations Subcommittee of the National Security Committee, said 
that Iran would in no way exchange its 3.5 percent enriched 
uranium for 20 percent enriched fuel from the West.  Iran would 
either buy fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) if someone 
wants to sell it, or produce it itself. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) OTHER ARTICLES/NEWS: 
 
 
 
¶C. EL-BARADEI: INSPECTION CONFIRMS IRAN'S HONESTY (November 17, 
IRNA) 
 
 
 
Summary:  The IAEA inspection results concerning Natanz conform 
to what Iran has announced.  The report makes reference to the 
following paragraphs from the report in enumerating the report's 
23 'positive points': Paragraphs 3-11, 18, 20, 21, 24, 26. 
[COMMENT: This IRNA article omits mention of the IEAE's comments 
on Fordo (paragraphs 12-17), the "Possible Military Dimensions" 
section (paragraphs 31-32), and the "Summary" (paragraphs 33-27] 
 
 
 
¶D. AYANDEH NEWS: "SENDING URANIUM ABROAD OUTSIDE THE REGIME'S 
RED LINE" 
 
 
 
[Ayandenews (pragmatic conservative), November 16] 
 
 
 
- A source close to Iran's nuclear negotiating team told 
"Ayande": "sending uranium outside of Iran before receiving fuel 
is outside of the Regime's redlines."  This source said "with 
the Supreme Leader's clear opinion that sending uranium outside 
of Iran before receiving 20 percent enriched fuel is out of the 
question, and the Islamic Republic is only prepared to lock and 
seal its own 3.5 percent enriched uranium under IAEA supervision 
on Iranian soil. 
 
 
 
- The IAEA website has reported equipping storage areas in 
Turkey to receive Iranian fuel and 'Middle East News' has 
claimed that President Ahmadinejad showed a positive reaction to 
the role of Turkey as a mediator in the exchange of fuel. 
 
 
 
- There is also a significant difference of opinion between the 
sides on how much Iranian enriched uranium needs to be supplied. 
 Whereas the US, Russia and Western countries are seeking 
1,200kg, some Iranian officials to include Expediency Council 
Secretary Mohsen Rezai say the maximum amount Iran needs to 
supply is 350 kg of 3.5 percent enriched uranium.  Some sources 
also inform us of the government's willingness to supply 800 kg 
of 3.5 percent enriched uranium in exchange for receiving 116 
kilograms of 20 percent enriched uranium. 
 
 
 
- Iranian experts emphasize separating the two issues of the 
confidence-building measures sought by the US of Iran's 
providing 1200 kg of its own uranium from the separate issue of 
buying TRR fuel. 
 
 
 
DUBAI 00000495  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
 
-Many Iranian officials, to include the Majlis Speaker Larijani, 
the Expediency Council Secretary Rezai, Judiciary Head Larijani 
and some credible institutions like the Tehran Society of 
Combatant Clerics believe that Iran's providing 1200 kg of its 
own 3.5 percent enriched uranium in exchange for receiving TRR 
fuel is an American trick and trap.  These officials suggest 
that Iran must demand suspension of the UNSCR Resolutions in 
exchange for delivering its own uranium, and that the issue of 
providing TRR fuel be carried out within a technical framework 
and far from political issues and the interference of 
international powers. 
 
 
 
- Supreme Leader Khamenei in his 13 Aban (November 3) speech 
decisively rejected Iran's entering into negotiations the 
outcome of which have been previously mandated by the US.
