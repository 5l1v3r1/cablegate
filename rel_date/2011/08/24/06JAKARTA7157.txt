JOINT PROPOSAL 
 
REF: STATE 83605 
 
(SBU) We delivered on June 29 reftel talking points and the 
accompanying "joint proposal" on geographical indicators 
(GIs) to Ministry of Trade Deputy Director for TRIPS and 
Market Access for Services Gatot Brasetyo Adjie.  Gatot told 
us that the Ministry of Trade was still awaiting final views 
on the joint proposal from the Ministry of Agriculture and 
the Ministry of Justice.  He noted that Ministry of Justice 
Director General for Intellectual Property Rights Abdul Bari 
Azed is the Government of Indonesia's (GOI) lead negotiator 
on GIs, and that Abdul Bari appeared to be leaning towards a 
more voluntary system, like that contained within the joint 
proposal.  Still, the GOI is aware that India and Peru have 
concerns about the joint proposal, and the GOI will use the 
upcoming June 12-13 TRIPS Council Special Session to consult 
with these countries prior to taking a firm stance.  We 
intend to meet later this week with Abdul Bari Azed and his 
staff to press them further for GOI support of the joint 
proposal.
