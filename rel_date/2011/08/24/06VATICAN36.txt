SUBJECT: POPE CONDEMNS SHIA MOSQUE BOMBING 
 
REF: STATE 028802 
 
¶1.  In response to the bombing of the Shia mosque on February 
22, Pope Benedict XVI on February 26 severely condemned all 
"violence done in the name of God."  Pope Benedict went on to 
emphasize, "These are the actions that sow mourning, fuel hatred 
and gravely hinder the already difficult work of the country's 
reconstruction."  The pope's "firm condemnation for the 
violation of places of worship," was announced during the Sunday 
Angelus in Saint Peter's square to a crowd of thousands and 
published worldwide. 
 
¶2.  We also note the February 24 statement of the United States 
Conference of Catholic Bishops declaring that they "strongly 
condemn this heinous terrorist attack on the Golden Mosque." 
Bishop Thomas Wenski, chairman of the Committee on International 
Policy issued a statement clearly stating that the Bishops' 
Conference is "alarmed and deeply disturbed by retaliatory 
attacks on other mosques and the loss of life that followed the 
attack."  While not part of the Vatican hierarchy, the Bishops' 
Conference expresses the views of the American Catholic 
community and reinforces those of the Holy See.
