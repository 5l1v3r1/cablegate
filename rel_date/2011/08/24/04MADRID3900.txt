ESTHOFF made reftel points October 5 to Health and 
Consumption Ministry Deputy Director General for 
International Affairs Jose Perez Lazaro, encouraging Spain to 
make a generous contribution to the Polio Eradication 
Initiative (PEI).  Perez Lazaro told ESTHOFF that Spain had 
already decided to contribute one million euros to the 
initiative and that the funds were being transferred via the 
World Heath Organization, one of the PEI's lead partners. 
Perez Lazaro said he believed the funds had not yet arrived 
into PEI accounts but would do so shortly.  He said he 
presumed we had approached Spain since Spain's donation had 
not yet "officially arrived."
