SUBJECT:  Lebanon: Media Reaction, March 3, 2008 
 
 
Atmospherics: 
------------ 
 
Despite the uproar over the step taken by the U.S. Administration in 
deploying the U.S.S. Cole Destroyer and other ships in the eastern 
Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon, the Israeli "massacres" against Gaza 
"killing innocent people and babies" were given top billing in the 
Lebanese press.  All media outlets expressed outrage over Israel's 
actions, with many emphasizing the "strange Arab and international 
silence" and the U.. "reluctance" to say anything. 
 
On Saturday Marh 1, most media outlets reacted negatively to the 
deployment of the U.S.S. Cole.  Pro-March 14 newspapers emphasized 
that the Lebanese Government did not know about this step, while 
Pro-March 8 newspapers seemed to feel that they were finally 
justified in accusing the Government of "conspiring" with the 
"American occupiers."  Editorialists of all affiliations appeared 
convinced that the U.S. action was a "misguided" U.S. decision that 
will only lead to disastrous consequences for Lebanon. 
 
Moderate, anti-Syrian An-Nahar commented that, "the message of the 
U.S. Destroyer U.S.S. Cole has changed into a visible internal 
crisis in Lebanon." Arab nationalist As-Safir observed that, "it 
will not be easy to erase the Lebanese fingerprints that 
participated in covering the decision to deploy the U.S. destroyer 
U.S.S. Cole...because such a dangerous decision cannot be taken by 
the U.S. without coordination with its allies including Lebanon." 
As-Safir added, "...In any case, the sudden change a week ago in the 
March 14 rhetoric, and the decision by a number of countries to 
evacuate their citizens prove that everyone knew about this 
step..." 
 
Editorialists of all political affiliations were extremely harsh in 
their assessment of the U.S. decision, with some even characterizing 
it as "stupid."  An editorialist close to Hizballah described 
Hizballah's "glee" over this "gift" by the U.S., and their 
considering U.S.S. Cole as proof that their conflict in Lebanon is 
with the American occupier and not a sectarian one.

Block Quotes:

"Bush's Peace," an editorial by Aouni Al'K'aaki in pro-Hariri 
Ash-Sharq (3/3): 
 
"Is this the peace that was promised to us by U.S. President Bush? 
Didn't he say that before the end of his term there will be a 
Palestinian state living side by side with Israel?  Does peace kill 
a Palestinian baby who was just born two days ago?  How can we 
believe Bush's words about this promised peace while Israel's 
missiles are killing babies, and destroying houses?  We might 
understand that there is a conflict between the Israeli occupier and 
the Palestinian people, ...but we do not understand the reason for 
Israel's massacres ...  The U.S. President did not even say one word 
that expresses rejection of such acts.  ..." 
 
"Sending The Destroyer Escalates Internal Tension...," an editorial 
by Rosana Bou-Monsef in moderate, anti-Syrian An-Nahar (3/1): 
 
"The U.S. decision to deploy the U.S.S. Cole off the Lebanese Coast 
has escalated tension in Lebanon.  ...This development will be 
easily used by the opposition to continue accusing the majority 
(March 14) of conspiring with the Americans.  ...Sources in the 
majority did not hesitate to say that this development was not 
helpful because it presented important trump cards to the 
opposition...particularly since it deployed this U.S. destroyer at a 
time when Israel is launching a war against the Palestinians in 
Gaza..." 
 
"Again," an editorial by Sateh Noureddine in Arab nationalist 
As-Safir (3/1): 
 
"Moving the U.S.S. Cole nearer to the Lebanese Coast is not only the 
most dangerous decision that was taken by the Bush Administration to 
support Lebanon, but also...the stupidest.  ...This American step is 
strangely naive and...will not even terrorize fishermen...but the 
Lebanese will pay the price dearly...because no one in Lebanon will 
wait for the U.S. navy, but different adversaries will kill each 
other...The Americans are returning, open your bunkers." 
 
"Response to 'Cole's Message: Terrestrial Rules are Different than 
Rules in the Sea," an editorial by Imad Marmal in Arab nationalist 
As-Safir (3/1): 
 
"...When anyone in the Hizballah leadership is asked whether they 
were terrorized by the U.S.S. Cole, they smile and say quickly: 
'Cole' was sent to us by God's grace.  Now, it has become clear that 
the conflict is between us and the occupier.  No one can give our 
conflict with March 14 a sectarian stigma.  ..."
