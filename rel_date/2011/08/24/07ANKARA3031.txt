(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of weekly reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary source is the Turkish General Staff 
(TGS) website, which documents contacts and clashes with the PKK, as 
well as casualties incurred. 
 
¶2. (U) During the December 16-23, 2007 reporting period, no GOT 
security official was killed or injured in clashes.  The total 
number of security force casualties for the year through December 
23, 2007 was 139 killed and 216 injured. 
 
¶3. (U) During the same period, no PKK terrorist was reported killed, 
according to the TGS website.  Two PKKers surrendered and three were 
captured.  However, TGS announced in a December 25 statement that 
between 150-175 terrorists were killed in Turkish Air Force strikes 
against PKK camps and operation centers in northern Iraq on December 
16 and 22.  According to TGS sources, more PKKers may have perished 
in bombing of caves/shelters in northern Iraq during the airstrikes. 
 Nevertheless, according to official TGS website figures, through 
the end of the third week of December the number of PKK militants 
killed this year was 284, the number of those captured was 182, and 
the number of those who surrendered was 81. 
 
¶4. (U) Civilian casualties for the year through December 23, 2007 
remain at 27 killed, with another 134 wounded.
