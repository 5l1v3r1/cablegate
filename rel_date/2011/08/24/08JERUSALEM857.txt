Main Stories:

Reports about a truce between Hamas and Israel lead coverage in all 
dailies. Papers report that the Israelis imposed the release of 
captured soldier Shalit as a condition to lifting, "the siege".  The 
dailies highlighted the visit of Israeli Defense Minister Barak to 
Egypt and his talks with the Egyptians regarding the truce. Related 
reports highlight Barak's participation in the World Economic Forum. 
 A photo of Barak, Quartet Representative Blair and Palestinian 
Prime Minister Fayyad leads coverage in Al-Quds. 
 
Quotes from Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad from his speech at the 
World Economic Forum receive front page coverage in all dailies. 
Reports highlight that Fayyad denied reports that Palestinian 
President Abbas plans to resign if a final agreement is not reached 
in negotiations with Israel within six months.  Fayyad also spoke 
about the upcoming Bethlehem Palestine Investment Conference and 
stressed that it will be a great opportunity for Palestinians to 
show that the atmosphere in the Palestinian Territories is conducive 
to investment.  Al-Ayyam quotes Fayyad identifying an end to 
settlement activity as, "our greatest demand", adding that any 
success in reaching a truce with Israel much include the reopening 
of Gaza border crossings. 
 
The dailies continue for a fourth day to carry coverage of 
Palestinian disappointment over President Bush's speech before the 
Knesset.  Al Hayat Al Jadida runs a front page black banner 
headline, ""National and Islamic parties warn of a new Israeli 
holocaust in the Gaza Strip and denounce Bush's remarks." The 
majority of editorials criticize Bush's Knesset speech for condoning 
Israeli violence on Palestinians.  Some note that Bush's remarks 
have pushed moderate Arabs and Palestinians to become more extreme. 
 
 
PLO member Yasser Abd-Rabbo insists that, Palestinian "President 
Abbas will be honest and open with his people and will tell them 
about the realities of the current situation," according to the 
dailies reporting on negotiations between Israel and the 
Palestinians.  Abd Rabbo describes American peace efforts as, 
"unable to achieve miracles."  He highlights that the gap between 
the negotiating parties remains, "deep and wide on core issues."  A 
recent opinion poll lends public support to the peace efforts, 
showing that a majority (56%) of Palestinians believe that 
negotiations with Israel should continue.  The poll was conducted by 
Al-Najah University in the West Bank town of Nablus.  Related news 
in the dailies reports that Israeli Defense Minister Barak expects 
early Israeli elections by 2009. 
 
Front page coverage brings an angry tone to Gaza reporting on the, 
"kidnapping of the mayor of Khan Yunis, by the Executive Forces 
affiliated with Hamas."  Separate coverage on all front pages 
highlights Israeli experts' belief that weapons have been smuggled 
into Gaza by sea and not through tunnels. 
 
News appears again in all dailies about Israeli plans to build a 
bridge in Bab Al-Magarb in the Old City of Jerusalem.  The dailies 
report that Israel has political and security interests in 
continuing diggings near the Haram Al Sharif (temple mount) in 
Jerusalem.  Muslim leaders have condemned the diggings for 
potentially damaging the Al Aqsa mosque and the Haram Al Sharif. 
 
The killing of a Palestinian 16 year old boy by the Israeli Defense

Forces near the Hiwarah checkpoint near the West Bank city of Nablus 
is front page news in all dailies. They report that the boy was 
killed when Israeli soldiers found his behavior to be suspicious.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------ 
 
¶1.  Independent Al-Ayyam runs an editorial entitled, "Bush made the 
life of moderate Arabs difficult... even impossible" (5/20): "May 
God help the moderate Arabs who were frustrated by Bush's speech 
before the Israeli Knesset that ignored the suffering of 
Palestinians and the peace process, as well as his promises to 
establish a Palestinian state.  He was more Zionist that Zionists 
themselves.  He even exceeded [being more Zionist than] the head of 
the Israeli Government Ehud Olmert, as many Knesset members said. 
He almost raised the American-Israeli relationship to a holy 
status... the most moderate Palestinian does not accept the current 
Israeli offer which includes ending the refugee [right of return], 
keeping Jerusalem under Israeli control and maintaining settlement 
activities.  As well as controlling the Jordan valley, while having 
a Palestinian state within the borders of the wall in what might be 
termed a state... American policies during Bush's term have made the 
life of moderate Arabs difficult, if not impossible...." 
 
¶2.   Al-Ayyam carries an op-ed by veteran columnist Muhaned Abd-Al 
Hameed entitled "The response to Bush's speech is to halt 
negotiations" (20/5): "...Bush slammed all of those who bet on his 
Annapolis initiative.  He threw Palestinians into a new crisis over 
whether or not negotiations should continue after Bush revealed all 
his cards... Can we continue negotiations with the Israeli 
Government which is in crisis and about to collapse? Or should we 
bet again on the losing horse of Bush and his policy with is similar 
to the Mifdal party's which is more Zionist than Olmert's 
Government?  The idea of Annapolis has already collapsed... "
