IRAN AND SYRIA 
 
REF: STATE 16285 
 
Deputy PolCouns approached Julian Juarez Cardenas, the Deputy 
Director General for UN-Related Security and Legal Issues at 
the Foreign Ministry, to convey USG concerns relating to the 
IAEA's most recent reports on Iran and Syria.  Juarez 
remarked that Mexico shared our concerns on these matters and 
planned to voice those concerns both singly and as party to 
the New Agenda Coalition.  Juarez was not aware that the 
question of making the Syria report public might come up for 
a vote at the upcoming Board of Governors meeting but voiced 
GOM support in principle for this proposition should it arise.
