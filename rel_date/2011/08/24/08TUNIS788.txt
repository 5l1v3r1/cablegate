¶1. (U) This cable contains highlights of recent economic 
developments in Tunisia on the following topics: 
 
¶A. Alstom Signs Contract for Power Plant 
¶B. Energy and Agribusiness Widen Trade Deficit 
¶C. Gas Price Hike... 
¶D. IMF Counsels Subsidy Reform 
¶E. Tunisia's Cereal Crop and Imports Down 
¶F. Tunisia Olive Oil Exports Up 15 percent 
¶G. Temporary Shortage of Vegetable Oil 
 
 
 
------------------------------------- 
Alstom Signs Contract for Power Plant 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On July 1st, French engineering company Alstom signed a Euro 
335 million (US $528.221 million) contract with the Tunisian state 
owned electrical utility (STEG) to build a 400-megawatt 
combined-cycle power plant in Tunisia.  The new facility will be 
constructed on the site of the old thermal power plant of Ghannouch, 
in Southern Tunisia, according to local media.  Alstom has secured 
an additional 12-year operation support and maintenance agreement 
but did not provide the financial details.  Alstom was selected by 
STEG after the April 28-29 visit of French President Sarkozy to 
Tunisia. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Since his election, Sarkozy has succeeded in 
securing several lucrative contracts in Tunisia by promoting French 
assistance in the field of power generation and nuclear energy for 
civil use.  France and Tunisia signed a framework agreement for 
cooperation on nuclear energy similar to those France signed with 
Morocco, Algeria, Libya.  Under the agreement, France will sell a 
nuclear plant to Tunisia after a period of 15 years.  End Comment. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Energy and Agribusiness Widen Trade Deficit 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) On July 14, the Tunisian National Statistics Institute (INS) 
released trade figures for the first half of 2008.  Compared to the 
same period in 2007, the Tunisian trade deficit widened 37 percent 
as imports jumped 27 percent, led by purchases of energy and 
agriculture goods. The deficit stood at TND 2.572 billion (US $2.186 
billion), up from TND 1.877 billion (US $1.483 billion) a year 
earlier.  Exports increased 24.6 percent to TND 12.235 billion (US 
$10.4 billion), while imports jumped 27 percent to TND 14.807 
billion (US $12.586 billion). 
 
¶5. (U) The upward trend of demand and prices for oil and commodities 
on the international market affected negatively Tunisia's energy and 
agribusiness balance, with respective deficits of TND 755.8 million 
(US $642.43 million) and 250.3 million (US $212.76 million).  The 
value of petroleum product imports doubled to TND 2.479 billion (US 
$2.107 billion), as Tunisia imports most of its crude oil and 
refined petroleum products.  Tunisia also exports some crude from 
aging wells.  Agricultural purchases, mainly cereals, stood at TND 
1.498 billion (US $1.273 billion) for the period, up from TND 1.152 
billion (US $910 million) a year earlier.  Meanwhile, the mining, 
phosphate, and derived products sector generated a trade surplus of 
TND 896 million (US $761.6 million), up from TND 384.4 million (US 
$303.7 million) in 2007, as Tunisia is the fifth largest phosphate 
producing nation in the world. 
 
¶6. (U) Textile and clothing trade exports, one of Tunisia's major 
sources of hard currency, increased 3.1 percent, TND 2.854 billion 
(US $2.426 billion) up from TND 2.769 billion (US $2.187 billion). 
Tunisia's textile sector consists of off-shore (export only) and 
on-shore enterprises, which may also sell their products 
domestically.  The off-shore side constitutes the engine for exports 
with TND 2.794 billion (US $2.375 billion), while on-shore companies 
generated only TND 60.3 million (US $51.25 million).  Imports, TND 
1.868 billion (US $1.588 billion), are almost static, with only a 
0.1 percent increase, compared with last year.  Imports for this 
 
TUNIS 00000788  002 OF 003 
 
 
sector correspond almost exactly to the value of material shipped to 
supply Tunisia's off-shore companies.  The trade balance for the 
sector shows a surplus of TND 986 million (US $838.1 million), up 
from TND 903 million (US $713.4 million) in 2007. 
 
----------------- 
Gas Price Hike... 
----------------- 
 
¶7. (U) On July 6, the GOT increased petrol prices by 5.6 percent to 
cope with its energy deficit as oil import costs have risen sharply. 
 A Ministry of Industry communique stipulated that the price of 
unleaded gas would increase from TND 1.250 (US $1.076) per liter to 
TND 1.320 (US $1.136).  Premium-grade gasoline has increased from 
TND 1.245 (US $1.06) to TND 1.320 (US $1.13) per liter.  To help 
explain the second increase in gas prices since March 2, the 
Ministry of Industry pointed out that the price hike will absorb 
only 20 percent of the actual increased cost born by the state 
budget.  True cost of the GOT's subsidy program has increased from 
TND 400 million (US $344 million) to TND one billion (US $862.67 
million).  The subsidy budget had been based on the assumption that 
world oil prices would average US $75 per barrel, the Ministry 
said. 
 
------------------------------------- 
... While IMF Counsels Subsidy Reform 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU) The IMF's Article IV consultations report, released on July 
10, stated that the current situation requires the GOT to pursue 
structural reforms and strengthening Tunisia's macroeconomic 
position.  The report added that on the budgetary side, the 
authorities are faced with a delicate tradeoff between the need to 
maintain the purchasing power of Tunisians in the face of rising 
international prices of food and petroleum products while preserving 
fiscal sustainability over the medium to long term.  Given the very 
rapid increase in direct and indirect subsidies related to these 
products, which the authorities currently estimate at 7.1 percent of 
GDP, and the strong likelihood that the current high world prices 
will persist, the IMF encouraged Tunisia to continue reforming its 
subsidy system and implement its energy conservation policy. 
 
---------------------------- 
Dim 2008 Cereal Crop Outlook 
Amid Soaring Cereal Imports 
---------------------------- 
¶9. (SBU) Statistics recently released by the government-run National 
Statistics Institute (INS) showed a sizeable increase in Tunisia's 
combined durum and soft wheat imports during the five-month period 
ending May 2008, compared to the same period a year ago. Durum 
quantities shipped into the country increased by nearly 25 percent 
to reach 340.1 thousand MT whereas soft wheat imports stood at 577.8 
thousand MT, up by a hefty 47 percent. This sustained wheat import 
trade is likely to continue as the 2008 wheat crop, currently being 
harvested, is believed to be below average. Scant rainfall during 
much of the last spring season took a toll on the wheat crop. 
Government of Tunisia has yet to issue its own crop estimate but 
Post has tentatively pegged overall wheat production at 1.25 million 
MT down from 1.45 Million MT reported last season. 
¶10. (U) Unlike wheat, barley imports are down by over 52 percent 
during the same time period. On July 10, Reuters reported that 
Mustapha Lassoued, an official at the main farmers' union (UTAP), 
said that high costs of barley imports pushed the country to slash 
purchases and switch to corn and other cattle feed for its expanded 
livestock. Post's current estimate for 2008 barley production stands 
at 0.36 million MT, a 30-percent decrease from the previous year. 
Drought is once again the main culprit. 
¶11. (U) Corn imports rose nearly 12 percent over the same period. 
This import level reflects continuing strong demand from poultry and 
dairy sectors alike. Overall demand for corn has been so far immune 
to international price hikes, thanks in part to subsidies and tax 
waivers granted by the Tunisian Government. 
--------------------------------------- 
Tunisia Olive Oil Exports Up 15 Percent 
--------------------------------------- 
 
TUNIS 00000788  003 OF 003 
 
 
 
¶12. (U) According to GOT figures, Tunisia's olive oil exports 
increased by 15 percent to 89,300 metric tons in the first quarter 
of this year compared to the same period last year.  Olive oil 
represents half the country's farm exports, which account for more 
than 10 percent of total exports.  Tunisia sells 90 percent of its 
olive output abroad, mainly to Europe.  The value of olive oil 
exports rose to TND 398.2 million (US $338.47 million) for the 
period from TND 291.9 million (US $230.6 million).  Tunisia is the 
world's fourth-largest olive oil producer. Over the past decade, its 
olive crops average averaged 145,000 metric tones per year.  The GOT 
aims to boost local production to 210,000 metric tons in the coming 
three years. 
 
¶13. (U) More than a tenth of the nation's 10 million inhabitants 
benefit from the labor-intensive olive oil industry, with 60 million 
olive trees covering 1.6 million hectares.  In order to upgrade 
exports receipts from olive oil, the GOT is encouraging national oil 
producers to shift their marketing of olive oil from bulk to bottled 
product. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Temporary Shortage of Vegetable Oil 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶14. (U) On June 3, Tunisian media reported a temporary shortage of 
subsidized edible oil due to a change in domestic marketing.  On 
June 6, a National Office of Oil (ONH) communique denied the 
shortage of subsidized edible oil, stating that the GOT had decided 
to sell bottled edible oil instead of the bulk oil, due to national 
health considerations. 
 
¶15. (SBU) Comment: The most likely culprit for the temporary 
shortage of edible oil was smuggling activities between Tunisia and 
Algeria.  Algerian newspaper El Khabar has reported that the soaring 
prices of edible oil in Algeria prompted smugglers to create new 
smuggling methods on the eastern borders, including bringing edible 
oil from Tunisia inside petrol cans.  According to El Khabar, five 
litres of Tunisian subsidized edible oil were being re-sold in 
Algerian shops for Algerian Dinars (AD) 300-400 (roughly US $4.62 to 
$6.16), while locally produced vegetable oils had reached AD 700-800 
(US $10.77 to $12.31).  End Comment.
