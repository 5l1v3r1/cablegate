-- Route Four (Salahadeen Road), the main north-south traffic 
artery, was open December 8, with a major detour at Netzarim

laborers, but open for the import of aggregates used in 
construction.

operating slowly. 
 
-- Rafah Terminal was open December 8 for arrivals and 
departures.  Although the IDF no longer prohibits the exit of 
male Palestinians age 16-35 from the Gaza Strip, lengthy 
checks at the border mean that few Palestinians in this 
category are actually able to exit.  There are no age 
restrictions for entry into Gaza.

checkpoint was open for residents of al-Mowassi December 8.
