¶1. (U) On Tuesday, August 2, 2005 at approximately 22:30 the 
Turkish National Police (TNP) conducted a controlled 
detonation of a "Banner Bomb" in the southern Ircel Province 
city of Mersin.  There were no reports of injuries. 
 
¶2. (U) Members of the PKK affiliated Halkin Kurtulus 
Ordusu-HPG (People's Liberation Army) placed a banner 
containing the picture of imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan and reading "Halkin Kurtulus Ordusu-HPG" on a bridge 
overpass on Okan Merezci Boulevard.  Upon arrival the TNP 
noticed an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) affixed to the 
banner.  The TNP cordoned off the area and called for EOD 
assistance.  TNP EOD conducted a controlled detonation of the 
device. 
 
¶3. (U) The TNP's caution when approaching the banner was due 
to the above mentioned group and like groups using the 
"Banner Bomb" as a method to inflict casualties on the police.
