The Government of Croatia approved on July 31 a 
humanitarian assistance package for Lebanon of 1.5 
million kunas (approx $265k) in cash to be 
distributed via the Croatian Red Cross.  The 
donation came in response to a request from the 
Lebanese mission to the UN for medicine and medical 
equipment which the GOC concluded could be better 
met through a cash donation.
