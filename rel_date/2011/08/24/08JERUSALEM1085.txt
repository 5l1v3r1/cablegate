Main Stories:

The three dailies lead with French President Sarkozy's visit to 
Bethlehem and meeting with Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas on 
June 24.  After signing an agreement worth $21 million to build an 
industrial zone in Bethlehem, Sarkozy commented that, "the tyranny 
suffered by the Jews ...should not be remedied by punishing the 
Palestinian people."  He emphasized that Israel's security cannot be 
achieved by the separation barrier or by settlement activities, but 
rather through the establishment of a democratic Palestinian state, 
which he considers a "priority" for France.  In Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, 
the French President promised strong support for a "true" peace 
process in terms of economic, political, diplomatic and even 
military support.  Abbas welcomed Sarkozy as a, "close friend to the 
Palestinian people," and praised the French President's view of how 
to solve the conflict. 
 
The June 24 Berlin donor conference is also front page news.  Donors 
pledged $242 million in support to the Palestinian police and 
Palestinian judicial institutions. The three dailies report that 
donors expressed support for the two-state solution and that 
Palestinian Premier Fayyad stressed the need to achieve progress on 
political and security tracks.  Fayyad underscored that halting 
Israeli settlement activity is a central topic in peace talks.  In 
related coverage, PLO negotiator Erekat reveals in an exclusive 
interview with Al Ayyam that Secretary Rice has invited the 
Palestinian negotiating team to Washington in July, to discuss 
issues related to a final peace agreement. 
 
The June 24 meeting between Israeli Premier Olmert and Egyptian 
President Mubarak focuses headlines on Hamas/Israel prisoner 
exchange talks.  Al- Ayyam reports that the leaders agreed to 
intensify exchange negotiations involving the release by Hamas of 
Israeli soldier Shalit.  The leaders also discussed reopening the 
Rafah crossing point according to the 2005 protocol whereby the 
Palestinian Authority and Egypt share responsibility for the 
management of the crossing under EU supervision.  In separate 
reporting, Mubarak stated that it is, "illogical" to link talks 
about the Hamas/Israeli truce in the Gaza Strip with the issue of 
freeing Israeli soldier Shalit.  Al-Quds notes comments by an 
Israeli official confirming a promise by Egypt not to reopen the 
Rafah crossing point until Shalit is released. 
 
All dailies express outrage over the, "assassination" of a 
university student and a leader of Islamic Jihad's military wing, 
Al-Quds Brigades, in the West Bank city of Nablus by Israeli 
soldiers on June 24.  Widespread condemnation of the act and calls 
by Islamic Jihad and Hamas for a "response" are reported in the 
dailies.  Papers note that Islamic Jihad launched a rocket attack on 
June 24 on the southern Israeli city of Sderot in retaliation. 
 
The dailies highlight a brief announcement that Israeli authorities 
have issued orders to suspend the demolition of 450 houses in the 
Mount of Olives neighborhood in East Jerusalem. 
 
Al- Quds runs an inside report about the June 24 reception held at 
the American Center in Jerusalem in honor of Palestinian and Israeli 
prize winners of the Institute of International Education's Goldberg 
Prize for Peace.  The award went to members of the Parents Circle 
Family Forum, a group of Israeli and Palestinian families who have 
lost family members to the conflict and now advocate reconciliation. 
 The paper notes that Deputy Principal Officer Thomas Duffy from the 
 
JERUSALEM 00001085  002 OF 002 
 
 
U.S. Consulate-Jerusalem and Deputy Chief of Mission Luis G. Moreno 
of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv delivered remarks.

BLOCK QUOTES:

¶1.  Al- Quds prints its daily editorial entitled, "In order to 
regain Arab and world support" (6/25):  Palestinian, Arab and 
international factors have led to a decrease in interest in the 
Palestinian cause compared to the support witnessed in the sixties 
and seventies... Internal Palestinian division, especially between 
Fatah and Hamas, is the latest factor... [the result is] a 
continuous decrease in Palestinian demands and continuous increase 
in Israeli greed... the greatest powers in the world have not put 
any real pressure on Israel to limit settlement activity and 
remove... checkpoints and obstacles....the greatest blame should be 
assigned to us as Palestinians, because we have closed our eyes to 
the danger of settlement activity and busied ourselves with marginal 
clashes over artificial positions and authority at a time when 
Israel has all the political, economic and security clout. 
Palestinians will not regain international support for their just 
cause unless they abandon these marginal conflicts and show proof of 
national unity and dedication to Palestine... 
 
¶2. Al-Quds carries an op-ed by Awni Sadeq entitled," No... solutions 
through division" (6/25):  ...[if we] look at the Palestinian 
situation... we do not see anything to inspire Israel to be serious 
or respond to any of the two Palestinian factions demands. 
[Negotiations] are only a game for the Israelis... they see some 
benefit to them ... internal Palestinian division cannot project any 
power that would force the [Israelis] to take negotiations 
seriously, but rather, it shows a weakness [that can be 
exploited]... There can be no... solutions while division remains."
