¶1. (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  During 2007 the Indonesian National Police (INP) 
investigated 19,459 police officers for violations of the INP Code 
of Discipline and Code of Ethics a 323% increase over 2006 
discipline cases.  This is also the first year that the INP 
publicized their discipline statistics in the media in attempt to 
demonstrate more transparency in the investigation and adjudication 
of internal discipline cases. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) INP DISCIPLINE CASES INCREASE 323% IN 2007: 
The INP Office of the Inspector General (IRWASUM) and the Office of 
Professional Security (PROPAM) publicly released their discipline 
statistics for 2007.  There was a dramatic increase in the number of 
investigations from approximately 4,600 in 2006 to 19,459 in 2007. 
The dramatic increase is a result of a stronger nationwide 
enforcement of internal codes of discipline and ethics, enforcement 
of policies and internal investigative procedures, defined 
investigative responsibilities of criminal cases and internal code 
violations, centralizing of data collection, and more accurate 
reporting.  The sharp increase in the number of cases does not 
necessarily suggest an increase in aberrant behavior by the police, 
but a reflection of stricter enforcement of internal discipline 
codes and policies. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) CONDUCT VIOLATION ANALYSIS: The conduct violations 
breQ@9S')tjQFQ#Pl6Pl discipline sanctions against 16,929 officers. Sanctions 
against the officers ranged from official reprimands to termination. 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU): TO TELL OR NOT TO TELL?: Animated and sometimes heated 
discussions occurred among senior leadership within the INP as to 
whether or not they should make the discipline statistics public. 
DOJ ICITAP had assisted the INP in revising their Codes of 
Discipline and Ethics in 2006 and assisted in streamlining internal 
investigation protocols in 2007.  ICITAP had also strongly suggested 
that the INP publish their statistics to demonstrate to the public 
that the INP was serious about reducing aberrant behavior within the 
INP and being more transparent the public about measures being 
taken.  Many senior leaders were concerned that instead of gaining 
public confidence and trust by publicizing discipline statistics and 
outcomes the public may think they are not in control of the 
personnel. Strong reformist leadership by three -star General Jusuf 
Mangga Barani (IRWASUM), two-star General Gordon Mogot (PROPAM), and 
Provost General Abdurachman prevailed and for the first time without 
provocation the INP published their information in major media 
outlets. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) ANOTHER PROGRESSIVE ORGANIZATIONAL STEP FOR THE INP: INP 
leadership believes that is it is essential to reduce the number of 
discipline cases within the INP.  The INP is planning to maintain 
the campaign of internal enforcement efforts but also initiate an 
education process and institute preventative measures that identify 
potential problems before they result in an internal investigation 
and discipline. The decision to publicize the discipline data should 
also not be taken lightly.  It should be considered as yet another 
very progressive step and mature organizational reform decision 
towards being more transparent and responsible to the Indonesian 
public.
