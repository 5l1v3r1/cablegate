¶1.  SUMMARY:  Senegal's Finance Minister Aboualye Diop, with Foreign 
Minister Gadio at his side, signed a USD 13.4 million Millennium 
Challenge Corporation 609(g) grant to support the current Compact 
development effort.  The DCM told a large press contingent that we 
remain hopeful that a Compact can be signed in the next five months. 
 Both Diop and Gadio are helpful to the MCC effort and the signing 
ceremony was valuable positive publicity for two ministers awaiting 
President Wade's decisions on cabinet changes in his very unpopular 
government.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  On April 1, Senegal's Finance Minister, Abdoulaye Diop, convoked 
a large press contingent, including television, radio, and print 
media, to record his signing of a USD 13.4 million Millennium 
Challenge Corporation 609(g) grant to support the current Compact 
development effort.  The agreement had already been signed by the 
MCC, but because of the unexpectedly public nature of Minister 
Diop's signing, DCM Jay T. Smith witnessed the agreement on behalf 
of the USG.  Surprisingly, Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio 
came to Finance Ministry to also participate in the ceremony. 
 
¶3.  In his remarks to the press, the DCM explained that the previous 
effort to conclude a Compact with Senegal did not succeed, but that 
this grant demonstrated the USG in general, and the MCC and the 
Embassy in particular, are determined to do all we can to sign a 
Compact before the end of the fiscal year.  Minister Diop noted that 
the current Compact proposal targets investments in important 
agriculture, road, and irrigation infrastructures.  FM Gadio shared 
a detailed history of the efforts of both countries, and underscored 
that the Senegal team needed to continue working very hard and that 
the entire government would be on board to support the process. 
Gadio stated that the MCC would bring not only project funding to 
the country, but also provide the example of how to effectively 
invest in rural infrastructure in a manner that Senegal could 
emulate. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  Ministers Diop and Gadio have long been among the best 
informed and helpful senior GOS officials trying to keep the GOS 
engaged with the MCC.  They have also strongly advocated for budget 
resources and administrative support for the local technical team to 
fulfill its requirements (which to date it has done very well). 
Even though the MCC grant will not be managed by Diop's Treasury, 
the amount is newsworthy.  Still, with a major cabinet overhaul 
expected in the coming weeks, we suspect some of the publicity push 
has to do with the two ministers demonstrating their value to 
President Wade and to a broadly dissatisfied Senegalese public.
