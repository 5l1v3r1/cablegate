SUBJECT: IRAQI COUNTERPART MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON 
 
REF: BAGHDAD 297 
 
¶1.  The Departments of State, Agriculture, Energy, Health and 
Human Services, and Transportation welcome meetings with 
their ministerial counterparts from the Ministries of 
Agriculture, Electricity, Health, and Transportation as well 
as Deputy Prime Minister Rafa'a Al-Issawi (reftel). 
 
¶2.  Each agency has committed to ensuring that our Iraqi 
visitors are met by senior officials in Washington.  As 
details of the visit come into focus, we will collaborate 
with Embassy Baghdad on an itinerary that can further 
solidify the partnership outlined in the Strategic Framework 
Agreement. 
 
¶3.  At this time, we urge Post to work with the Ministers and 
other members of their delegation on obtaining visas.  Given 
the delays that can occur in visa processing as well as the 
need for senior leadership of the new U.S. Administration to 
be appointed and confirmed, we recommend that this visit 
occur in May.
