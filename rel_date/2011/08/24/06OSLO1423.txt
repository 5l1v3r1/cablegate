Post was unable to confirm how Norway will vote in the ESS 
scheduled for 17 November.  However, Tormod Endresen, head of 
the MFA's Human Right's Section, noted that the GON is 
disappointed to see the ESS invoked again and feels that it 
is an improper use of the vehicle.  Norway will strongly 
discourage other nations from abusing the ESS process in the 
future.
