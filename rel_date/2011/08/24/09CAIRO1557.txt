----------------------------------

preliminary results of the FY2008/2009 showed an improvement in the 
macroeconomic indicators. The budget deficit remained at 6.9%, same 
as last year. The Minister considered this a significant achievement 
given the global economic situation. Revenues went up 24% to LE274.8 
billion ($49.6 billion), while expenditures increased by 21.7% to 
LE343.7 billion ($62 billion). The Minister said the budget deficit

World Bank grants $270 million to Railway Authority

¶3. (U) The Egyptian Prime Minister, Ahmed Nazif, and the Ministers 
of Investment and International Cooperation attended the signing of 
a $270 million soft loan between the Railway Authority and the World 
Bank.  The loan extends over 30 years with a grace period of 5 
years, after which it will be charged an interest rate of 1.5% 
annually.  The Authority will finance payment of the debt without 
incurring additional burdens on the government, the Minister of 
International Cooperation said. The loan aims at improving the 
efficiency and safety of railway services as part of the overall 
reforms aimed at the transportation sector. (All newspapers, 
8/3/2009) On a similar note, Minister of Investment Mahmoud Mohey 
Eddin met Shamshad Akhtar, Deputy Regional Manager at the World 
Bank, to discuss projects about bank finances including the new 
mortgage project targeting youth and the under-privileged. The bank 
has provided $300 million to build 80,000 residential units over 3 
years. (Al Alam Al Yom 8/5/2009)

Regulator rejects offer of France Telecom 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority (EFSA) rejected 
for the third time France Telecom's appeal to allow the purchase of 
the remaining shares of the Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services 
(MobiNil).  EFSA reported France Telecom's proposal because prices 
offered were less than the price set by the international 
arbitration ruling for the majority of the company, which amounts to 
LE273.26 ($49.32) per share.   According to press report, France 
Telecom offered LE230 ($41.52) per share in its third bid and 
offered LE237 ($42.78) a share in its second bid on May 19. France 
Telecom plans to challenge the decision in the Egyptian supreme 
court.  (El Masri El Yom, Al Ahram, 8/6/2009)

The Jonglei Canal 
---------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Minister of Irrigation Mohammad Allam issued a ministerial 
decree to form a delegation to visit Sudan in early October to study 
the current status of the Jonglei canal and the possibility of the 
completion of the canal. It is currently about 70% complete and has 
a length of 375 km. If the first phase is completed, it would save 
approximately 4 billion cubic meters (BCM) of water split between 
Egypt and Sudan; the second phase would save about 7 BCM of water.

pharmaceutical companies to import 5 million doses of a new H1N1 
vaccine, expected to be approved by the WHO in January 2010 and to 
arrive in Egypt by April or May of the same year. (Yom 7, 8/ 5/2009)
