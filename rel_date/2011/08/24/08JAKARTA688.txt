SUBJECT: AVIAN INFLUENZA - MARCH 24 KOMNAS MEETING 
 
 
1.(SBU) SUMMARY: The National Committee for Avian Influenza Control 
and Pandemic Preparedness (KOMNAS) convened a meeting of municipal 
health officials and donor partners on March 24 to discuss the 
progress of interventions to date in JABODETABEK, the greater 
Jakarta area which includes the neighboring cities of Bogor, Depok, 
Tangerang, and Bekasi. During the meeting, KOMNAS representatives 
highlighted ten recommended priority actions.  KOMNAS Chief 
Executive Bayu Krisnamurthi estimated the loss as a result of bird 
flu since 2004 to reach approximately $446 million.  The greater 
Jakarta area has felt the impact of these losses acutely, as over 
half of the human cases and 70 percent of the deaths occurred in 
this region. As of April 1, Indonesia has 132 human cases, with 107 
fatalities.  End Summary.

KOMNAS Recommends 10 Priority Actions 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Data presented at the KOMNAS meeting showed JABODETABEK 
remains the epicenter of the disease for both poultry and humans. 
Livestock official Edy Setiarto noted that 70 percent of the 
Indonesia's AI cases in birds occur in Jakarta and the surrounding 
districts.  Illustrating the human impact, more than half of the 107 
human fatalities to date occurred in this region.  Bayu Krisnamurthi 
referenced a January 2008 Menkokesra coordination meeting that 
recommending implementing ten priority actions for the Jakarta metro 
area, as detailed below: 
 
-- Local government commitment to control AI through an increased 
focus on the poultry industry and improved coordination between the 
human and animal sectors; 
 
-- Live bird markets cleaned every 7-10 days; 
 
-- Regulated transport of live birds (e.g., live enclosed poultry in 
trucks); 
 
-- Eliminated sale of live poultry by 2010, and requiring slaughter 
houses to meet specified standards; 
 
-- Continued programs to cage backyard chickens; 
 
-- Permitting PNPM (National Program for Community Empowerment to 
Alleviate Poverty) fund allocation for AI; 
 
-- Physicians and nurses at clinics, hospitals, and private medical 
centers trained to recognize and treat AI; 
 
-- Risk reduction education communication focused on students and 
women; 
 
-- Pandemic preparedness and planning; 
 
-- Increased research of AI in humans and birds, and vaccination in 
the poultry industry.

Loss Due to Bird Flu Amounts to Rp4.1 Trillion 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3. (U) KOMNAS Chief Executive Bayu Krisnamurthi estimated the loss 
as a result of bird flu since 2004 to reach approximately $446 
million USD (Rp 4.1 trillion). "The amount does not include the loss 
of employment opportunity and the decrease of protein consumption by 
the community," he said. Rp4 trillion accounts for losses from 
culling, decreased demand for chickens and eggs, the decline of 
chicken and egg consumption in restaurants, additional costs spent 
by poultry raisers and government in handling bird flu, and the 
impact on other sectors such as tourism.

¶4. (U) Ministry of Health reports three additional cases of human 
H5N1 infection in the last 10 days of March. The three new cases 
include a 15-year-old male from West Java who checked into the 
hospital on March 22, transferred to a second hospital March 26, and 
died on March 26.  He had a brother who died 15 days ago of dengue 
and parents reported chicken deaths at the home.  The second case 
involves a 11-year-old female from West Bekasi who checked into the 
hospital on March 23 and died on March 28.  Her risk factor for AI 
exposure remains unknown.  A third case occurred in a 22 month old 
female from Sumatra who checked into the hospital on March 22 and 
transferred to an AI referral hospital on March 24.  Her condition 
is stable.  She had no known contact with birds, but her sibling 
died one week ago of a combination of typhoid and acute respiratory 
syndrome.  As of April 1, Indonesia has 132 human cases with 107 
deaths.
