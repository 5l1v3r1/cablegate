SUBJECT: FM SHALOM'S BRIEFING TO DIPLOMATIC CORPS 
 
¶1.  Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom summoned Chiefs of Mission 
to Jerusalem June 22 to give an update on disengagement from 
Gaza and related issues.  Clarifying PM Sharon's previous 
comments concerning disengagement under fire, he said that 
extremist attacks would halt disengagement only long enough 
to allow the IDF to deal with the specific threats or 
attacks, but that otherwise it would proceed on schedule.  He 
also pleaded with the international community not to be in 
direct contact with Hamas or Islamic Jihad, saying that such 
contact undercuts moderates and strengthens the hands of 
extremists.  He repeatedly stated his hope that withdrawal 
from Gaza would create a new model for peace, and would lead 
to better relations with the Arab world and a re-opening of 
the Arab embassies and interest sections closed in October 
¶2000. 
 
¶2.  He also stated his belief that what he termed Palestinian 
President Abbas' failure to comply with the commitments made 
at the Sharm Al-Sheikh summit threatens Israel's ability to 
maintain the popular political will to continue with 
withdrawal and endangers the other (unspecified) steps the 
GOI is planning to take in the near future to ease conditions 
for Palestinians.  A highlight of the address was a four 
minute video of a recent would-be female suicide bomber 
stopped at the Erez checkpoint on her way to blow up a Be'er 
Sheva Hospital where she had received burn treatments.
