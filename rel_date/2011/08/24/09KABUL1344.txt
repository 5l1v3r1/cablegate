SUBJECT: PROPOSAL FOR 2009 JULIA TAFT FUND 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) We propose to use the Taft Fund to support 
building a medical clinic and expanding an existing school at 
Sohadat land allocation site (LAS), west of Herat.  Sohadat 
LAS is a government-sponsored township for landless former 
refugees and internally-displaced persons (IDPs). 
Neighboring villages are also very poor, and underserved by 
provincial education and health organizations.  Jesuit 
Refugee Services (JRS) has been working with the community at 
Sohadat (formerly known as Taqi Naqi) for about six months, 
training teachers, providing part-time medical assistance, 
and developing essential infrastructure.  The proposed 
construction would enlarge the existing school building 
enough to permit more grades to be taught, and children from 
neighboring villages to join children at Sohadat in gaining 
primary education.  In addition to the direct benefit to the 
children, this will contribute to the returnees' local 
integration.  The proposal would also provide a secure, 
private environment for visiting medical personnel to serve 
the community.  The amount of support requested by JRS is 
small enough to be funded by the 2009 Julia Taft Fund. 
 
 
Project Description 
------------------- 
¶2.  (U) Sohadat LAS already has a four-classroom school 
building, funded by PRM and built by International Rescue 
Committee in 2007-2008.  In April 2009 JRS began providing 
education services, with five teachers from Herat commuting 
daily to teach grades one through five.  Initially 69 Sohadat 
children enrolled, but as more families moved to the site 
this spring, the number has grown to 98.  Elders from 
neighboring villages have asked that their children, too, be 
allowed to enroll. 
 
¶3.  (U) The four existing classrooms are already too small 
for the enrolled resident children.  There is no staff room, 
school office space, or space for extra-curricular 
activities.  JRS proposes to build four additional 
classrooms, a staff room, a school office, and a boundary 
wall for the school and adjoining clinic (described below). 
With the additional space, more grades of school can be 
taught and neighboring village children will be welcomed to 
attend.  The boundary wall may bolster girls' primary school 
attendance, as parents hesitate to send their daughters to 
exposed facilities. 
 
¶4.  (U) The population at Sohadat LAS is still too small for 
the Provincial Department of Public Health (DoPH) to provide 
medical services.  JRS began providing weekly mobile health 
services to the community in early 2009.  JRS supports a team 
of three doctors (two men and one woman) and a medical 
student who provide basic medical services, medicines, and 
referrals to the Herat Provincial Hospital.  The DoPH has 
requested JRS to enhance medical services by appointing a 
regular medical team for the LAS. 
 
¶5.  (U) JRS and the DoPH have signed a memorandum of 
understanding, but have yet to implement it due to lack of 
dedicated space at the LAS where health services could be 
regularly provided.  JRS proposes to build a two-room medical 
clinic.  One room will be for the doctor/examinations, and 
the other will be for the pharmacy.  The clinic will be 
enclosed within the same boundary wall as the school. 
 
 
Justification 
------------- 
¶6.  (U) The proposed infrastructure is a one-time investment 
that builds upon previous PRM projects at the site.  JRS will 
use construction materials left over from the IRC project at 
Sohadat LAS.  This reduces waste, responds to a government 
request that the materials be used on-site, and assists the 
original intended beneficiaries.  It is not/not a commitment 
to provide education or medical services.  It is nevertheless 
a valuable contribution to the community, as it provides 
better access to education and medical services JRS is 
willing and able to provide.  Lack of education and lack of 
medical services are two of the top concerns of repatriating 
Afghans, so this project would support Sohadat LAS residents' 
sustained repatriation. 
 
¶7.  (U) Because the expanded school will permit children from 
neighboring villages to participate in school, it will also 
lead the community a step closer to local integration. 
Friction can develop between long-standing residents of host 
communities and members of government-established LASs.  This 
project will help reduce the possibility of jealousy 
developing over differing access to valuable services. 
 
¶8.  (U) Finally, the infrastructure project helps reinforce 
the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's 
Afghan National Development Strategy (ANDS).  The LAS scheme 
is practically the only program under ANDS for Afghans 
returning from exile, and its success at this early stage 
relies on assistance from the international community. 
Enabling JRS to provide education and health services to this 
vulnerable population of returnees and long-term residents 
also supports the ANDS.
