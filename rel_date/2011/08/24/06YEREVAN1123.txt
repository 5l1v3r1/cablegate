REF: YEREVAN 01108 
 
¶1.  On August 14, the Ambassador gave an interview to Armenian 
Public TV to explain UN Security Council Resolution 1701 on Lebanon. 
 The interview was aired without commentary on Public TV's evening 
news, the most-watched news programs in the country.  During the 
interview, Ambassador Evans emphasized the need to establish a 
lasting peace, stating, "It was clear that nobody wanted to have a 
cheap and easy ceasefire that would lead to an outbreak of similar 
hostilities again.  So what has happened as a result of the last few 
weeks of diplomacy is that all the major players--the Israelis, the 
Lebanese, and the outside powers--have worked together to fashion 
Resolution 1701."  The Ambassador stressed the United States' 
commitment to helping the people of Lebanon and Israel, noting that 
Secretary Rice has announced that the United States will increase 
 
SIPDIS 
aid to Lebanon to 50 million USD. 
 
¶2.  The Ambassador also released an op-ed on the situation in 
Lebanon, the text of which was drawn from the Echo Chamber points. 
The op-ed was published on August 15 in "Hayastani Hanrapetutiun," a 
government-owned newspaper that is widely read by government 
officials and opinion makers.  In the op-ed, which was entitled 
"Helping Lebanon Regain Control," the Ambassador mourns the loss of 
civilian life but states that he believes Resolution 1701 opens a 
path towards establishing a lasting peace.  The Ambassador 
emphasized the need to change the circumstances that led to the 
conflict, stating, "From the start, the United States and leaders in 
both Lebanon and Israel have said we could not return to the 
situation that allowed Hezbollah to provoke this crisis.  A durable 
ceasefire requires changed circumstances so that the government of 
Lebanon, not a terrorist organization, controls the territory of 
Lebanon."

COMMENT

¶3.  Whereas the Armenian media generally do not focus on 
international news, preferring instead to report on Armenia-specific 
events, the situation in Lebanon has received broad coverage due to 
the large number of Armenians living in Lebanon and the close ties 
of Armenians with the Diaspora community there.  Media reports have 
generally focused on condemning the loss of life and destruction in 
Lebanon, sometimes blaming Israel or the international community for 
not ending the conflict more quickly.  Through his media activities, 
the Ambassador has emphasized that the United States is committed to 
helping the people of Lebanon, and has expressed the U.S. view that 
a durable and lasting peace needs to be established.
