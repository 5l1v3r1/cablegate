REF: STATE 153542 
 
¶1. Embassy EconOff delivered reftel demarche to Ministry of 
Industry, Tourism and Trade Subdirector General Teresa 
Zapatero Martinez and to Ministry of Environment Subdirector 
General for International Relations Amparo Rambla Gil on 
11/13/07.  AgCouns delivered the demarche to the Ministry of 
Agriculture's Subdirector General for International 
Relations, Alicia Villaruiz, on 11/13/07.  None of these 
officials were in a position to provide views on the demarche. 
 
¶2. Comment: We suspect that the Spanish government has not 
yet had time to discuss this issue.  Moreover, given the 
French and Italian sensitivities described in reftel, 
presumably this matter will be subject to complex 
negotiations in Brussels among the Member States.
