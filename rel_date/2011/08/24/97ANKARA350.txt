¶2.  MANY OF ERBAKAN'S PROPOSED HUMAN RIGHTS 
AMENDMENTS/INITIATIVES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PRE-TRIAL DETENTION, 
REORGANIZATION OF THE STATE SECURITY COURTS, CREATION OF A HUMAN 
RIGHTS UNDERSECRETARIAT WITH A NEW MINISTER, AND THE 
DECRIMINALIZATION OF SOME FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION OFFENSES HAD 
ALREADY BEEN ANNOUNCED BY DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER CILLER ON OCTOBER 
17, 1996 (REFS B AND C).  SOME OF THE PM'S PROPOSALS, SUCH AS THE ONE 
PERTAINING TO THE USE OF SKIN FROM SACRIFICED SHEEP, AND THE 
FREEDOM TO WEAR HEADGEAR ARE MORE OF INTEREST TO HIS ISLAMIST 
SUPPORTERS.  END COMMENT.
