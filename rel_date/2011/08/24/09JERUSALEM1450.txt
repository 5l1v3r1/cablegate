SUBJECT: FATAH CONGRESS ELECTS FRESH FACES TO FRC 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On August 16, the Fatah Sixth Party Congress 
released official election results for the (now) 81-member 
Fatah Revolutionary Council (FRC).  Voting resulted in a 
substantially newer FRC, with only 11 incumbents retaining 
their seats.  Many newly-elected members are former First 
Intifada activists, and represent a fresh generation of 
mid-ranking political leadership for the party. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to Fatah contacts, the vote was generally 
considered fair, and the results were welcomed by delegates 
eager to portray the Congress as a generational milestone for 
Fatah.  Abu Mazen, announcing the results, termed the vote a 
"new launch," saying the "spirit of youth" would empower 
Fatah to address the challenges posed by national dialogue, 
elections, and negotiations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Abu Mazen also praised the election of female 
candidates by a"more civilized" FRC election process.  Of the 
81 victorious candidates, 11 are women (with Amneh Jibril 
leading the overall vote tally), one was born an Israeli Jew 
(long-time Palestinian rights activist Uri Davis), and four 
are Christians.
