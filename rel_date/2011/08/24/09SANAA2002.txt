¶1.  (U) Summary.  Yemen has 415 confirmed cases of H1N1 
influenza, and health officials suspect an additional 800 
cases.  The ROYG has a 50,000 supply of PPE (Personal 
Protective Equipment) to prevent the spread of the virus and 
100,000 doses of Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) to treat H1N1 
patients, but has no vaccine to inoculate people before being 
infected.  One public hospital continues to treat H1N1 
patients, while private hospitals are refusing to admit 
suspected cases, as concern for the virus spreads.  As the 
number of H1N1 cases increases, the ROYG's inability to 
convince hospitals to treat H1N1 patients is concerning.  As 
the numbers of H1N1 cases rise, the pandemic threatens to 
overwhelm health resources within Yemen.  End Summary. 
 
415 CASES CONFIRMED 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) As of October 20, the Ministry of Public Health and 
Population had 415 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza and 
reported 15 deaths from "swine flu."  According to Dr. 
Abdulhakim Al-Kohlani, Director General of Disease and 
Epidemiological Surveillance, the ROYG currently has only one 
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) machine to test samples; as a 
result, the ROYG is able to test only 30 samples a day. 
Thus, health officials are not testing contacts, only 
treating them if they have symptoms.  Kohlani told EconOff on 
October 21 that he predicts there are at least 800 more cases 
in Yemen, raising the number of H1N1 influenza infections to 
well over 1000.  (Note: The Ministry of Health has requested 
USG assistance to procure additional PCR machines.  End 
Note.) 
 
ROYG RESPONSE 
------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) The Ministry of Health's original USD 60,000 budget 
for surveillance has been supplemented with USD 300,000, 
specifically for H1N1 influenza surveillance and detection. 
The ROYG has approximately a 50,000 supply of PPE (Personal 
Protective Equipment) and 100,000 doses of Oseltamivir 
(Tamiflu), some of which were donated from Bahrain.   The 
ROYG does not have H1N1 vaccine and will be unable to meet 
the Saudi requirement to vaccinate those going on the Hajj in 
mid-November.  The ROYG is waiting for a supply of WHO 
vaccine to come in by late November or early December, and is 
expecting 2.2 million doses of vaccine at that time.  (Note: 
This will be too late to vaccinate people going on the Hajj. 
End Note.) 
 
¶4. (U) The ROYG continues to close classrooms and schools 
when H1N1 cases are detected.  Kohlani told EconOff on 
October 21 that, so far, the ROYG had closed one school in 
Hajja governorate.  On October 27, Saba News reported that 
three schools were closed in Sana'a after several students 
tested positive for H1N1 influenza.  Another October 27 Saba 
News report indicated that only one hospital, the Al-Thawra 
Public Hospital in Sana'a, is receiving H1N1 patients; the 
other hospitals are refusing to receive suspected H1N1 cases. 
 Kohlani admitted that despite Ministry of Health directives, 
it is difficult to convince private hospitals to access 
potential H1N1 patients due to the fear that health workers 
will become infected themselves. 
 
¶5.  (U) Comment: The official number of H1N1 cases in Yemen 
(415) is most likely understated, since the Ministry of 
Public Health and Population has the ability to test only 30 
samples a day.  Estimates that reach into the 1000s are 
presumed accurate.  As the number of H1N1 cases increases, 
the ROYG's inability to convince hospitals to treat H1N1 
patients is concerning.  As the numbers of H1N1 cases rise, 
the pandemic threatens to overwhelm already insufficient 
health resources within Yemen.  End Comment.
