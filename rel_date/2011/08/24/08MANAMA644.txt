SUBJECT: BAHRAINI FM MAY ATTEND FORUM FOR THE FUTURE 
 
REF: STATE 99179 
 
¶1. (SBU) A/DCM met with MFA Bilateral Relations Director Dr. 
Dhafer Al-Umran on September 18 to inform him of the 
Secretary's intention to attend the Forum for the Future 
October 18-19 in Abu Dhabi, and to encourage FM Sheikh Khalid 
bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa to attend as well.  Al-Umran could not 
immediately say whether the FM would attend, but said "If 
Secretary Rice will be there, then Sheikh Khalid will want to 
be there too." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Al-Umran noted that the FM would be traveling with 
the Crown Prince on an official visit to Japan on October 11 
and 12, and that the Crown Prince was also scheduled to be in 
India around the time of the Forum for the Future.  He 
speculated that the FM might be able to break away from the 
Crown Prince's India itinerary.  Post will follow up.
