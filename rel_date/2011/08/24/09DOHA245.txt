SUBJECT: Saeb Erekat Uses Brookings Event to Address Netanyahu 
 
¶1. (U) Speaking at an event organized by the Brookings Doha Center 
on March 31, Palestinian Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat, addressing 
himself to the Al Jazeera camera taping the event, conveyed several 
messages to new Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Obama, 
the Quartet, Hamas, and Arab leaders. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Message to Prime Minister Netanhayu:  You missed a big 
opportunity in your Knesset speech to commit yourself to a two-state 
solution.  There is no other choice, so just accept it.  You can 
make peace with Shas and Avigdor Lieberman and Labor, but peace with 
me is much more important to the stability of the region. 
 
¶3. (U)  Message to President Obama:  Do not adopt a policy of trying 
to accomplish what is possible for the Israelis; instead, go after 
what is needed for both parties.  Americans must realize that their 
borders are no longer with Canada, Mexico and the two oceans, but 
with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, China, and Pakistan.  With 200,000 
of your kids in this region, you have a stake in stability. 
 
¶4. (U)  Message to the Quartet:  If Netanyahu refuses to abide by 
his Road Map commitments, I hope you will treat him the same way you 
did Hamas when it refused to abide by previous Palestinian 
commitments. 
 
¶5. (U)  Message to Hamas:  No one is asking you to recognize Israel, 
abide by previous agreements or give up resistance.  As a political 
party, you can believe whatever you want, but as a government, we 
must act responsibly no matter who is in charge, and that means 
accepting previous agreements and dealing with Israel.  Let us 
organize legislative and presidential elections, and solve our 
differences by ballots, not bullets. 
 
¶6. (U) Message to Arab Leaders:  Palestine and Jerusalem are bigger 
issues than any of your countries or capitals, but my shoulders are 
not big enough for all of you to tap dance on.  Help us, but do not 
use us as political pawns in your own arguments.
