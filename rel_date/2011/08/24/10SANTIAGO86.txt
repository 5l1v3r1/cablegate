SUBJECT: CHILE RESPONSE TO GEORGIA DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 6667 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Eduardo Schott, 
Deputy Director for European Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs.  Schott was unaware of Ecuador's potential decision to 
recognize the independence of the Georgian separatist regions of 
Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  He will consult with colleagues about 
the possibility of raising the issue with Ecuador.  He said that 
Chile is comfortable sharing its reasons for not recognizing the 
regions, but other countries are free to make their own decision. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post will report any additional response from the 
Government of Chile.
