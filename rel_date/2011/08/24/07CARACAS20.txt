¶1. The following is post's update on the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela (BRV) for the 2006 Country Reports on Terrorism: 
 
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela's cooperation in 
international efforts against terrorism remained negligible. 
President Hugo Chavez continued to criticize U.S. 
counterterrorism efforts, enhanced cooperation with state 
sponsors of terrorism Cuba and Iran, and was unwilling to 
deny safe haven to members of Colombian terrorist groups. 
 
Chavez' ideological sympathy for the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army 
(ELN) limited Venezuelan cooperation with Colombia in 
combating terrorism.  FARC and ELN units continued to cross 
into Venezuelan territory for rest and re-supply with 
relative impunity.  Splinter groups of the FARC and another 
designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, the United 
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), operated in western 
parts of Venezuela and were involved in narcotrafficking. 
The government pursued the latter with greater energy. 
 
It remains unclear whether and to what extent the Government 
of Venezuela provided material support to Colombian 
terrorists.  However, weapons and ammunition -- some from 
official Venezuelan stocks  and facilities -- regularly 
turned up in the hands of Colombian terrorist organizations. 
The government did not systematically police the 1,400-mile 
Venezuelan-Colombian border to prevent the movement of groups 
of armed men or interdict arms flows to narcoterrorists. 
 
A member of an Islamic extremist group in Venezuela placed 
two pipebombs outside the American Embassy in Caracas on 
October 23, 2006.  Venezuelan police responded quickly, 
safely disposed of the two pipebombs, and immediately made 
one arrest.  The investigation by Venezuelan authorities 
resulted in the additional arrest of the alleged ideologicial 
leader of the group.  At year's end, both suspects remained 
in jail and prosecutors are pressing terrorism charges 
against them. 
 
Responding to a complaint filed by two deported ETA 
terrorists in the Interamerican Human Rights Commission, BRV 
representatives negotiated and signed an "amicable 
settlement" in June 2006.  The BRV agreed in the settlement 
to facilitate the naturalization of Basques who came to 
Venezuela as political refugees in the 1980's as a result of 
a bilateral agreement between the governments of Spain and 
Venezuela.  After media reports revealed that ETA terrorists 
would obtain substantial benefits from the settlement, the 
BRV repudiated the terms of the agreement in December 2006. 
 
Venezuelan citizenship, identity, and travel documents 
remained easy to obtain, making Venezuela a potentially 
attractive way-station for terrorists.  International 
authorities remained suspicious of the integrity of 
Venezuelan documents and their issuance process.
