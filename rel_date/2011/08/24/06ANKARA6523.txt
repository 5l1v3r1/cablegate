Pope Benedict Pays Landmark Visit to Turkey 
All papers report Pope Benedict XVI, on his first visit to a Muslim 
country since becoming pontiff last year, will travel to Ankara on 
Tuesday amid tight security.  Protests are expected by small groups 
of Islamists and hardline nationalists. 
 
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan will hold a brief talk with the Pope 
at Ankara airport before leaving for a NATO summit in Riga.  After 
his talks with President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and the religious 
affairs directorate Diyanet, the Pope will visit Ephesus near the 
Aegean port of Izmir where the Virgin Mary is believed to have 
lived.  Benedict XVI will then move on to Istanbul for talks on 
Christian unity with Patriarch Bartholomew I. 
 
"The Pope is the head of the Catholic world and maintaining good 
ties between the Islamic and Catholic worlds is in everybody's 
interest.  Disagreeing with somebody does not mean we are not 
hospitable to that person," said Professor Ali Bardakoglu, who heads 
Diyanet.  Government spokesman Cemil Cicek said "We believe that 
this visit is an important opportunity to show to the entire world 
that Turkey is a country of tolerance and hospitality." 
 
"Benvenuto!" says Sabah, defining the pontiff's visit as "historic" 
at a time of rising strains between the West and the Islamic world. 
Sabah says in a positive tone the Pope will visit a mosque for the 
first time in Istanbul, will issue messages of religious brotherhood 
and will support Turkey's EU bid.  Diplomatic sources said Benedict 
would tell Erdogan that he had dropped his former opposition to 
Turkey joining the EU, says Sabah.  Cumhuriyet comments the visit 
will turn into a "rapprochement summit" with the Pope holding his 
most important talks with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch Bartholomew 
Â¶I. 
 
Several papers report Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) officials 
intervened in a press filing center in Istanbul where Greek Orthodox 
Patriarchate members were handing out press registration cards 
reading "Papal Voyage to the Ecumenical Patriarchate," claiming the 
Patriarchate was not authorized to hand out press accreditations.  A 
crisis was averted after talks with the MFA, and the Directorate 
General Press and Information Office at the Turkish Prime Ministry 
started registering the press members to follow the pontiff during 
the visit. 
 
Pope Benedict XVI will leave Turkey on Friday. 
 
Finland's Cyprus Plan Collapses, 
All papers report the EU term president Finland said on Monday that 
its Cyprus plan collapsed and there is no progress on the Turkish 
Penal Code's Article 301, which restricts free speech.  EU 
enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn said accession talks with Turkey 
will not be stopped, but will mov more slowly after Ankara's 
failure to open its ports and airports to ships and planes from 
Cyprus. 
 
Prime Minister Erdogan said the failure of the Finnish initiative on 
Cyprus did not mean that efforts would slow down, stressing that 
Turkey fulfilled all its duties.  Foreign Minister Gul said he does 
not think that the EU leaders will decide to freeze talks with 
Turkey.  Gul noted that Turkey can open its ports to Greek Cypriot 
use, but the EU should implement its earlier decision to end the 
international isolation of Turkish Cyprus.  A spokesman for the 
Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) told the press yesterday, "The 
failure of the Finnish proposals, despite our constructive attitude, 
should not affect our negotiations negatively." 
 
Erdogan May Meet Bush at NATO Riga Summit 
Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Radikal, Cumhuriyet, Zaman, Yeni Safak 
and others report Prime Minister Erdogan is to participate on 
 
ANKARA 00006523  002 OF 003 
 
 
Tuesday in a summit meeting of NATO in Riga.  Afghanistan will be 
raised as the top issue at the summit which will also discuss 
developments in Iraq as well as the Alliance's operations in Kosovo, 
Darfur and the Mediterranean.  Unidentified US officials told Zaman 
there was no planned talk between President Bush and Prime Minister 
Erdogan, but that the two leaders may meet at lunch or on the 
sidelines of the summit. 
 
Commenting on the NATO Summit, Ilter Turkmen warns in the mainstream 
Hurriyet that Turkey, as a non-EU member, stands to lose out if NATO 
is weakened: "NATO is not the only security actor in Europe.  EU as 
well, developed a security and defense policy.  The two 
organizations coordinate in their missions, but, from time to time, 
problems occur in this coordination.  Some of the issues to be 
discussed at the Riga Summit relate closely to Turkey, for example 
missile defense.  It is a potential threat for Turkey that Iran will 
not end its nuclear weapon project and continues to produce long 
range missiles.  Therefore, I am sure, Turkey will support NATO's 
'joint missile defense system' proposal wholeheartedly.  The second 
issue that interests Turkey is energy.  Establishment of a defense 
system for the energy infrastructure will be discussed at the summit 
as well.  NATO is very important for Turkey from many angles.  If 
NATO is unsuccessful in some of its missions, Turkey will be 
affected negatively more than any other European country as it is 
not an EU member.  In order to help NATO maintain its strength, 
Turkey should not avoid some serious responsibilities, such as in 
Afghanistan." 
 
Writing in the Islamist-intellectual Zaman, Fikret Ertan observes 
that Afghanistan will be at the top of the NATO Summit agenda:  "Two 
issues will determine the NATO Summit's agenda in Riga today.  The 
first and most important issue is Afghanistan.  Afghanistan is a 
very important country for global security, but one beyond NATO's 
mission limits and, yet, NATO officially took over the 
responsibilities in this country and got involved in fighting.  The 
increasing death toll of the NATO Forces in Afghanistan forced some 
of the NATO members to bring some restrictions to their military 
forces and decide not to send them to war zones.  As an example, 
Germany is refusing to move its troops from relatively safer North 
Afghanistan to the South. These caveats (limitations) and the 
shortage of forces and equipment, affects NATO's fighting force and 
ability negatively.  This is why Afghanistan is going to be on the 
top of the agenda in Riga.  One other important issue to be 
discussed at the summit is NATO's 'global mission.'  Defenders of 
this mission stress that NATO is not a regional alliance any longer 
and it should be responsible for global military and security 
missions." 
 
Newsweek on Coup Chances in Turkey 
Zaman and Yeni Safak report on the Newsweek International op-ed by 
Zeyno Baran of the Hudson Institute in which Baran wrote, "The 
chances of a military coup in Turkey occurring in 2007 are roughly 
50-50."  Derya Sazak of Milliyet said this was not a realistic 
assessment and that Turkey today was not the Turkey of the 1980s. 
Asli Aydintasbas of Sabah said the Newsweek column reflected views 
of some individuals in Washington, and asked Prime Minister Erdogan 
to pay attention to the "changing winds" in Washington.  Sabah 
editor-in-chief and columnist Fatih Altayli alleges that Baran is 
connected with a senior State Department Official, implying that 
Baran's views should be viewed in that context.  Kursat Bumin of 
Yeni Safak criticized both Baran and Newsweek, saying, "Would a 
serious expert write such a thing?"  Both papers quote Baran as 
claiming some important details had been lost after her article was 
abridged by Newsweek.  "None of my military sources said they would 
try a takeover," Baran said, adding they were talking about a 
"postmodern military intervention."
