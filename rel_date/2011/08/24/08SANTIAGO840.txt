SUBJECT: CHILEANS LAMENT EXPULSION OF U.S. AMBASSADORS 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Ambassador met separately with Interior 
Minister Perez Yoma and Foreign Minister Foxley and briefly 
discussed the expulsions of Ambassadors Duddy and Goldberg from 
Venezuela and Bolivia.  Both Chilean Ministers expressed surprise 
and disappointment with the developments.  Perez Yoma called the 
expulsions shameful and senseless.  Foxley recounted his personal 
experience with an inexplicable Morales-directed assault against 
Chile.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a September 12 meeting (septel) with Interior 
Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma, Ambassador Simons said the two expelled 
U.S. Ambassadors from Bolivia and Venezuela were first-rate, career 
diplomats.  Neither is impulsive nor were they trying to provoke a 
fight.  The Ambassador added both were good friends and had advanced 
together with him through the ranks of the diplomatic service. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Perez Yoma described the expulsions as shameful 
("verguenza") and senseless, indicating the irresponsible actions 
were taken to hide internal problems.  He agreed that there is no 
internal coordination within the Bolivian government and often the 
Defense and Interior Ministries are given separate instructions and 
do not know what each other is doing. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On September 11, the Ambassador discussed the expulsion of 
Ambassador Goldberg with Foreign Minister Foxley.  The Foreign 
Minister shared a personal and inexplicable action directed by 
President Morales.  Prior to the OAS meeting of Foreign Ministers in 
Medellin last May, the Bolivian Foreign Minister briefed Foxley 
confidentially that he had been instructed to strongly criticize 
Chile.  Foxley warned that he would be obliged to respond and urged 
that the Bolivian not do it.  The Bolivian Foreign Minister 
responded he had no choice, and the two went through the unfortunate 
motions, Foxley said.
