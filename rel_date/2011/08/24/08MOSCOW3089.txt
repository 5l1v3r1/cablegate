SUBJECT: INSURGENTS IN INGUSHETIYA TARGET FEDERAL TROOPS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The internet-based Caucasian Knot has 
confirmed only three deaths from an attack on a convoy of 
federal troops in Ingushetiya, not the 50 claimed by the 
jihadist Kavkaz Center website and the opposition 
Ingushetiya.org website.  While initial reports of major 
casualties appear unsubstantiated, the fact that insurgents 
have raised the stakes by targeting the FSB is noteworthy. 
International assistance organizations implementing 
USG-funded humanitarian projects report that security 
conditions have deteriorated dramatically in the past several 
days.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Internet-based media sources have painted different 
pictures of events in Ingushetiya over the weekend.  The 
opposition Ingushetiya.org website posted a story over the 
weekend that on October 18 insurgents had attacked two 
convoys of Russian federal law enforcement troops with 
rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons near the 
village of Galashki, resulting in 50 deaths.  This report may 
have been based on a claim by the jihadist Kavkaz Center 
website.  The more reliable Caucasian Knot, citing a 
spokesperson from the Ingushetiya Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, initially posted on its website that two FSB troops 
had died during a single attack and updated this information 
on October 19 by adding the name of a third soldier who died. 
 Caucasian Knot stated that federal troops had sealed off the 
villages of Muzhichi and Galashki in the Sunzha District of 
southern Ingushetiya.  It also reported October 20 that the 
previous night there was a car bomb attack on a Special 
Forces base in the town of Karabulak, several kilometers east 
of Ingushetiya's largest city Nazran, as well as small arms 
fire upon police stations throughout Ingushetiya. 
Moscow-based news outlets also reported other attacks and 
special operations over the weekend in which several persons 
died. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) A member of the local staff of International Rescue 
Committee (IRC) passed by after the attack on the convoy and 
reported seeing at least two helicopter ambulances lifting 
away casualties.  The head of World Vision International's 
operations in the northern Caucasus has noticed a notable 
downward spiral in the security situation in Ingushetiya over 
the last several days.  She said that World Vision will be 
taking additional measures to increase security, particularly 
for movements of personnel to and from project sites 
throughout Ingushetiya.  The acting head of International 
Medical Corps told us that members of his local guard force 
reported that half of the police officers in Ingushetiya have 
resigned.  The head of IRC's operations agreed and added he 
heard rumors that residents of Ingushetiya were "leaving the 
republic in greater numbers." 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Insurgents may have tried to use the tension 
surrounding the planned October 19 protest rally in Nazran 
against the perceived bias in the official investigation of 
the death of opposition leader Magomed Yevloyev to further 
escalate instability with attack.  The protest has been 
postponed and its organizer Magomed Khazbiyev announced on 
October 18 that it would take place in Moscow and not in 
Nazran.  This latest incident may also be the last assault 
before winter sets in on the northern Caucasus.  Whatever the 
reason for the increased violence, the attack on Russian 
troops is a disconcerting escalation of violence which 
heretofore had targeted mainly local police and public 
officials.
