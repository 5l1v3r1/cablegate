¶1.  Summary:  On October 26, Katherine DiMatteo, representing the 
U.S. Organic Trade Association (OTA), met with two French 
agricultural journalists and participated in a round table with 20 
people from the French organic industry and regulatory services.  In 
these events, organized by FAS and PAO, the main issues discussed 
were organic and biotech coexistence, issues hindering a U.S./EU 
organics equivalency agreement, trends in organic supply and demand, 
and perspectives on U.S.-French organics trade. End Summary. 
 
Organic and Biotech Coexistence 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  In France, coexistence is a highly sensitive topic that has yet 
to be legally defined.  The organic industry is vehemently opposed 
to biotech production, believing that large-scale production of 
biotech crops would make it impossible to grow organic crops, and GM 
contamination would not allow organic production to be free of 
biotech.  As both organic and biotech production (the EU's 0.9 
percent tolerance level not withstanding) are thriving in the United 
States, the French were eager to know how coexistence issues are 
handled in the U.S.  French journalists questioned (given the large 
scale of biotech production) whether organic corn could still be 
available in the U.S. 
 
¶3.  Katherine DiMatteo explained that organic and biotech are simply 
two different production systems, and that U.S. organic production 
does not include biotech.  If an organic crop is exposed to 
adventitious biotech presence but the producer has followed the 
National Organics Program's (NOP) protocols in good faith, his crop 
is no less organic.  DiMatteo explained that growing organic corn is 
possible in the United States, coexisting with GM or conventional 
corn, due to barrier zones around both organic and biotech fields, 
coordination of different pollination periods, and separate storage 
and transportation facilities. 
 
 
Supply and Demand Inadequacy 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Neither the journalists nor the round table participants seemed 
convinced that the measures taken in the U.S. to guarantee such 
coexistence adequately protected the organic crop from an 
adventitious biotech presence. 
 
¶5.  DiMatteo described the scope of the U.S. organics sector and 
explained there is currently a shortage of organic products in the 
United States, with demand significantly higher than supply in feed 
grains and dairy.  Representatives of the French Federation of 
Organic Growers (FNAB), a French company producing organic fruits 
and vegetables (Pro Natura), and the Chambers of Agriculture (APCA) 
said that such a gap between organic supply and demand also exists 
in France.  They expressed lack of trust in the quality of Chinese 
organic products that France and the United States need to import to 
meet domestic demand.  On the other hand, a representative of the 
French certification company ECOCERT stated that certifying 
organizations present in China are regularly audited and observed. 
 
Differences in U.S. and EU Organic Standards 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  An organic specialist from the French Ministry of Agriculture 
(MinAg) said that U.S. exports of organic products to France do not 
compete directly with organic products grown in France.  According 
to the MinAg, during the past three years, the United States has 
exported organic products to France such as dates, dried fruits, 
rice, orange juice, popcorn, and almonds. 
 
¶7.  The French MinAg listed the points about which equivalency could 
not be established, to date, between the United States and the 
European Union, on organic standards.  According to the MinAg 
official, these include: the different approaches towards biotech; 
the chemicals permitted in crop protection; the fact that small U.S. 
producers are not audited; the fact that U.S. organic meat comes 
from animals fed with 100 percent organic feed stuffs, while in the 
EU, the feed doesn't have to be 100 percent organic; different 
approaches towards antibiotics, which are not allowed under U.S. 
organic standards unless there is no other means possible to treat 
an ill animal but are allowed in more circumstances under EU 
standards. 
 
¶8.  Comment: Discussions on respective market structures as well as 
concerns about increasing imports from emerging countries as demand 
outpaces domestic organic production capacity highlighted the common 
ground between the U.S. and the EU on organics.  End Comment.
