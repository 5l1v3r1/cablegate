(SBU) Polcouns conveyed reftel to Ambassador Amrani, who is 
duly supportive of the Democracy Assistance Dialogue and has 
discussed it with the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights 
(OMDH).  He agrees that the OMDH is a good candidate. 
Morocco wants broader representation, however, from human 
rights NGOs, including the Moroccan Association for Human 
Rights (AMDH).  (Comment: A leftist organization that is 
currently boycotting the USG. End Comment.)  He said that he 
would get back to us on Morocco's nominee soon.
