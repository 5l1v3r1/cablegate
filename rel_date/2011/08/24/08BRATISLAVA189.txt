¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points to Milan Ciganik, 
Deputy Director of the MFA's Department for Disarmament, 
Counter-Terrorism and OSCE, and Sona Baiova from the 
Department of the UN and International Organizations. Baiova 
explained that Slovakia implements UNSCRs such as 1737, 1747 
an 1803 on a national level and in accordance with the terms 
of the resolutions. The GoS sends implementation reports to 
the UN within 40 days and reports any attempt to circumvent 
the restrictions later on. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Under Slovak law, relevant Ministries are 
responsible for making themselves aware of UNSCRs that effect 
their activities. However, the MFA sends a fax to relevant 
ministries informing them of new restrictions they must 
implement and requiring return notification of actions taken 
to the MFA within 30 days. MFA then uses these return reports 
to produce its implementation report for the UN Headquarters. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Baiova showed Poloff a copy of the implementation 
report for UNSCR 1803, which she expects to submit to the UN 
before April 25. The National Bank, and the Ministries of 
Finance, Interior, and Post and Telecommunications had all 
been asked to take action to enforce UNSCR 1803. In addition, 
MFA's Consular Department sent an instruction to all Slovak 
Embassies and Consulates instructing them not to issue visas 
to any of the individuals subject to vigilance, restraint or 
a travel ban.
