-- Mohamed bin Ibrahim Al-Shibany penned in progressive Arabic daily 
Al-Qabas under the title "Until When, Palestine?" (7/11): "Arabs 
will not have power, pride, and respect from other nations without 
their rulers knowing what they must do for their nation and 
religion.  God will ask them about the excessive deaths that take 
place [in Palestine], all of which is working against them, not for 
them.  And, how about people whose only concerns are to increase 
their daily revenues and enlarge their accounts, even if it comes at 
the expense of their own people?" 
 
-- Dr. Jassim Al-Fuhaid commented in moderate Arabic daily Al-Rai 
Al-Aam under the title "Gaza=Pride" (7/11): "The reclusive official 
Arab stance towards the massacres taking place has helped to bolster 
the isolation that already exists between people and their 
governments.  The people seethe with anger and rage, especially when 
they realize how constrained they are.  They are powerless to aid 
those under siege, whose children's bodies are burning before us on 
our colored TV screens.  What further enrages the people is the 
realization that their governments mobilize their troops only to 
close the borders in the face of any effort to aid their brothers 
with funds or weapons." 
 
-- Dr. Yaqoub Ahmed Al-Sharah inquired in moderate Arabic daily 
Al-Rai Al-Aam under the title "The Difficult Choice" (7/11): "The 
situation in Iraq under the dictatorial rule of Saddam reflected the 
conflicts caused by the tyrannical rule and not the interference of 
external powers.  Do the ramifications of the occupation of Iraq 
after thirty years of repression and dictatorial rule not warn of a 
civil war between the Sunnis and Shiites in the Islamic world as we 
see today and everyday in Iraq?"
