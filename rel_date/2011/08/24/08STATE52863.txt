REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1.  This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2.  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Posts' assistance 
in conducting a post-shipment inquiry on license numbers 
05-050016544, 05-988470, and 05-990843  for 
the export of defense hardware to Indonesia.  Posts are 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern inquiry 
within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern inquiry 
will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3.  Reason for request:  Foreign Consignee Growhill 
Enterprise PTE LTD has appeared on only one 
previous license, and its bona fides have never been verified 
by a Blue Lantern inquiry. 
 
¶4. Action Singapore:   Department requests that Post verify 
the bona fides of Growhill Enterprise 
PTE LTD as a responsible recipient of United States Munitions 
List (USML) items, and confirm its role 
in the listed transactions.    If possible, conduct a site 
visit in order to provide Department with 
an assessment of the company's business operations and 
on-site security. Emphasize that the unauthorized 
re-export or retransfer of USML items is strictly prohibited. 
 
Action Jakarta:  Post should verify the bona fides of PT 
Ciptaarta Hadikara in the listed transactions. 
If possible, conduct a site visit in order to provide 
Department with an assessment of the company's 
business operations and on-site security, and determine 
whether it is a responsible recipient of USML 
items.  Emphasize that the unauthorized re-export or 
retransfer of USML items is strictly prohibited. 
Confirm that the end-user received all of the items listed on 
the licenses, and that they are being used 
for the stated purpose. The following questions provide 
suggested guidance: 
 
 
For Badan Intelijen Strategis (BAIS) TNI: 
 
--Are you familiar with PT Ciptaarta Hadikara? 
 
--Did you receive all of the USML items listed on each of the 
licenses?  If not, what is the status of 
the unshipped items for each applicable license? 
 
--Is PT Ciptaarta Hadikara an official supplier/contractor 
for Indonesia MOD? 
 
--Does the Indonesian MOD have any other contracts with this 
company? 
 
 
For PT Ciptaarta Hadikara: 
 
--When was the company established and who are its principals? 
 
--What is the nature of your business (i.e., What types of 
items does your firm handle and do you serve 
as a broker)? 
 
--What types of organizations are among your typical 
customers and where are they located? 
 
--Does the company have proper supporting documentation, 
including purchase orders from Badan Intelijen 
Strategis which confirms your role on each of the licenses? 
 
--Is the company currently handling or storing any of the 
USML items listed on the licenses? If so, do 
you have 
secure facilities and proper accounting and security 
procedures for handling these sensitive USML items? 
 
--Did the company integrate/incorporate any of the USML items 
into other products at the request of the 
end-user? If so, please specify. 
 
--Do you understand the restrictions on United States 
Munitions List (USML) items, especially 
the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and 
re-exports? 
 
 
End Action Request.
