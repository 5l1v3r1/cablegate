¶1. Embassy Ashgabat played the Iranian Embassy team on 
October 11 in a 30-minute soccer match during the first round 
of a diplomatic tournament organized by the Embassy of 
Kazakhstan.  Team U.S.A. was made up of the DATT, RSO, GUNNY 
and 2 MSG, CAO, and a Nevada National Guard representative. 
We noted that the Iranian team was considerably younger; many 
of their players looked about 17 or 18 years old, likely the 
dependents of embassy staff.  They also had a professional 
looking and sounding coach who shouted instructions to the 
players. 
 
¶2. Although Iran ultimately prevailed 3 to 0, the atmosphere 
of friendliness and good sportsmanship dominated throughout 
the match.  Several of our players noted how excited the 
Iranians seemed to be playing the U.S. team: The family 
members, who had sat off to the side during their first two 
matches in the morning, stood close to the field taking 
pictures as the two teams stood in line before their match. 
One player said they all seemed "almost giddy" about it.  On 
several occasions, when players from either side tripped and 
fell, members of the opposing team helped them up.  And when 
Team U.S.A.'s goalie (RSO) intercepted three goals in a row, 
the Iranian side cheered for him. Iran's ambassador, 
Mohammad-Reza Forqani, who also played, sided with the U.S. 
team's position when the referee mistakenly took five minutes 
away from the first period (the missing minutes were later 
reinstated). 
 
¶3. At the conclusion, both sides shook hands, and as our team 
headed to the parking lot, a vehicle full of Iranian players 
and family members waved good-bye. 
 
¶4. COMMENT: Few words were exchanged during the soccer match, 
but the atmospherics were hard to miss: It was clear that the 
Iranians were excited to be playing the U.S.  And the U.S. 
team was happy to have kept our opponents to three goals. 
END COMMENT.
