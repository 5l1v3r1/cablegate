(SBU) We delivered Ref A points to Annabel Anderson, 
Assistant Secretary for Northern, Southern, and Eastern 
Europe Branch at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
 Anderson reiterated what she told post on September 22 (ref 
B) - Australia will not make any new commitments to assist 
Georgia, and will not attend the October 22 donors 
conference.  Anderson noted that Georgia lies well outside 
Australia's normal Asia-Pacific area of focus for such 
assistance, and said the provision on August 14 of emergency 
humanitarian assistance to Georgia in the wake of the 
conflict was an exception to the rule.
