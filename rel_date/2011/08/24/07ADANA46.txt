EKSPRES / BOLGE:        A local TV station interviewed the U.S. Consul 
to Adana, Eric Green, on the day that marked the fourth 
anniversary of the Iraq war.  Green reportedly said that after 
four years, the situation in Iraq was not as well as they like 
it to be and there was a high level of instability there. 
According to Green, President Bush had acknowledged this, and, 
they were changing their strategy to try to improve the 
situation in Iraq.  Green, when asked questions about the PKK 
issue, asserted that PKK was designated as a terrorist 
organization by the U.S. and denied having any contacts with 
them.  Regarding the PKK's relationship with any people or 
authority in northern Iraq, Green said their objective was to 
get all of the Iraqi authorities, those in Baghdad as well as 
those in northern Iraq, to work to end PKK's presence in that 
country. 
 
EKSPRES / BOLGE / ZAMAN:        Umit Ozgumus, Chairperson of 
Adana's Chamber of Industry, talked with members of ISKAD (Adana 
Businesswomen Association). During the talk Ozgumus mentioned 
that despite the U.S. officially stating that it respected 
Turkey's territorial integrity and it designated the PKK as a 
terrorist organization, it has not been sharing information with 
Turkey about 5000 people who have established presence in the 
Qandil Mountains in Northern Iraq and who have been entering 
Turkey to raid police stations and kill soldiers and civilians. 
 
BOLGE / EKSPRES:        Adana's new governor Ilhan Atis paid a
