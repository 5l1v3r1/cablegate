SUBJECT: POLISH MFA WORKING WITH FINANCE MINISTRY ON 
COMMITMENT TO GEORGIA DONORS CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 109212 
 
(U) EmbOffs delivered Ref A demarche October 14 regarding 
next week's Georgia donors conference in Brussels to Tomasz 
Orlowski, Georgia desk officer at the Polish MFA.  Orlowski 
reiterated, per Ref B, that Foreign Minister Radoslaw 
Sikorski is still working with the Finance Ministry to 
determine whether the budget would allow Poland to make a 
donation, but no final decisions have been made concerning a 
possible pledge by the GOP at next week's donors conference. 
However, Jerzy Rohozinski of the MFA's Development 
Cooperation Department told us October 17 that Poland planned 
to double financial resources devoted to assistance for 
Georgia compared to current levels.  Poland's assistance 
activities will be conducted within the framework of the 
overall Polish Foreign Assistance Program, which will be 
implemented on a competitive basis by government agencies and 
nongovernmental organizations.
