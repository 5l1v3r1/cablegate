¶1.  (SBU) On December 2, Charge Walkley personally discussed 
reftel A points with Seychelles President James Michel.  The 
CDA stated that the Al-Qaeda planning for September 11 came 
out of Afghanistan and that the stability in Afghanistan is a 
matter of international security. Michel agreed, adding that 
stability in Afghanistan is crucial.  The CDA also delivered 
reftel points to Jean-Paul Adam, Principal Secretary for the 
Office of the President, who echoed the president by noting 
that because the economy of the Seychelles is increasingly 
linked to the Middle East, stability in Afghanistan is 
critical to the Indian Ocean region. 
 
¶2.  (U) President Obama's reftel policy speech was not widely 
covered in the Seychelles media.  The Seychelles Broadcasting 
Corporation (SBC) broadcast limited excerpts on radio and TV 
on the evening of December 2, with dubbing in Creole and 
French.  There was no newspaper coverage to date. 
 
¶3.  (U) In anticipation of the President's speech, Embassy 
Public Affairs posted on its Seychelles Virtual Presence Post 
(SVPP) website a weblink to the speech on America.gov. A 
press release announcing the date and time of the President's 
speech was sent in advance to all Seychelles media. 
Immediately following the first broadcast of the speech, a 
weblink was established on the SVPP website and links also 
were established to the Afghanistan policy webchats at 
America.gov.
