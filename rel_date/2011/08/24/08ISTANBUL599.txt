SUBJECT: NO AMERICANS INJURED IN BOMB ATTACK AT AKP 
ISTANBUL PARTY HQ 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Media sources reported, and an official of Turkey's 
ruling AK Party (AKP) confirmed to Consulate personnel, that 
at 1500 hours local time an explosion occurred at the AKP 
Istanbul headquarters in the Sutluce neighborhood of 
Istanbul. Istanbul Governor Muammer Guler released a 
statement indicating that the explosion resulted from the 
placement of a sound bomb near the entrance of the AKP 
headquarters building. According to the AKP official, the 
device was hidden in a package placed in the vicinity of an 
X-ray machine. Media sources report that the explosion 
occurred as party officials were meeting on the upper floors 
of the building. It broke windows, but appears to have caused 
little structural damage. Ten people, including five police 
officers, are reported injured, two critically. No American 
casualties have been reported. No claims of responsibility 
have yet been made. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Consulate General Istanbul is following the 
situation and will report significant developments as 
warranted.
