SUBJECT: FRANCE ON NATIONAL STRATEGY TO INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS 
AGAINST KLEPTOCRACY 
 
REF: STATE 131554 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy raised reftel points on the National Strategy to 
Internationalize Efforts Against Kleptocracy with senior MFA 
officials, and is sharing points with Ministries of Finance and 
Justice.  MFA DAS-equivalent for International Financial Affairs 
Cyrille Pierre told us the French stance on corruption had evolved 
considerably over the past several years and the GOF considers the 
fight against corruption a priority.  The outcome of the recent peer 
evaluation of France in the OECD's anti-bribery working group 
attested to its efforts. 
 
¶2. (U) Pierre said reftel concept of financial center partnerships 
working together to deny safe havens was "interesting" and, he 
thought, the GOF would be receptive to working together to flesh out 
the concept.  He cautioned against any effort that would involve 
independently generating a "blacklist" of kleptocrats.  It would be 
important that cooperation be geared towards denying access to 
kleptocrats who had been found guilty of impropriety by recognized 
bodies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In the spirit of reftel strategy, Pierre suggested there 
might be opportunities for France and the U.S. to coordinate 
existing anti-corruption efforts in the developing world.   For 
example, there were only three countries in the African Union that 
had not implemented the UN Convention Against Corruption, he said. 
Coordinating demarches to those governments might be an effective 
means of underscoring the importance of the issue.  France also was 
interested in pursuing more robust efforts to increase the 
transparency of off-shore financial centers, whether through ongoing 
work in the FATF, or under the auspices of the Anti-Bribery 
Convention. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  We would do well to pursue Pierre's suggestion of 
finding opportunities to coordinate messages on anti-corruption.  A 
joint message might have particularly strong impact in France's 
traditional zone of influence.  Post would be pleased to work with 
the Department and regional missions on such an effort.
