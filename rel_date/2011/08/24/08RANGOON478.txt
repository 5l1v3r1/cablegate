ON UNSCR 1803 (IRAN SANCTIONS) 
 
REF: A) STATE 21770  B) SECSTATE 48615 
 
(SBU) Embassy Rangoon recommends against delivering this demarche to 
the GOB, which is generally hostile to U.S. initiatives, especially 
concerning sanctions.  Economic relations between Burma and Iran are 
negligible.  Recently, Burma and Iran have voiced support for each 
other against international criticism.
