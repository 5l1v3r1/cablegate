SUBJECT: FRANCE ON U.S. UNGA FIRST COMMITTEE (UNFC) 
RESOLUTION ON COMPLIANCE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 178316 
 
Poloff delivered reftel demarche to MFA DAS equivalent for 
Chemical, Biological and Conventional Weapons Disarmament, 
Marion Paradas and her deputy, Arnaud Roux, on September 28. 
In a follow-up conversation on September 30, Paradas and Roux 
said that the GoF appreciated receiving the text and that, in 
principle, the GoF had no problems with the draft resolution. 
 She added, however, that the document could be made 
stronger.  She said that upon receiving the draft resolution, 
her office compared it with preceding resolutions, the most 
recent from 2002, and noticed that the present draft 
resolution was considerably more vague.  She suggested that 
the resolution would run into less resistance if it were more 
specific concerning the obligations of states.  For example, 
she said, previous resolutions mention "verification 
provisions" and "agreed obligations;" these phrases, she 
noted, were missing in the present draft resolution.  Roux 
suggested that the draft resolution would be made stronger 
still if it emphasized the role of the UN in the process. 
However, Paradas stressed, while it finds the draft 
resolution less focused than its predecessors, the GoF 
supports the general thrust of the document.
