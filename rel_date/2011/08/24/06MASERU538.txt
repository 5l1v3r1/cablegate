SUBJECT: LESOTHO'S FOREIGN MINISTER ADDRESSES NAM UNGA RESOLUTION, 
DETAINEE ISSUES 
 
REF: a) STATE 176793; b) STATE 178020 
 
¶1.  On October 26, Ambassador Perry (accompanied by POLOFF 
Smith, notetaker) delivered a demarche (Reftel A) on the 
Non-Aligned Movement's draft resolution "Consequences of the 
Israeli Invasion on the Human Rights Situation in Lebanon" to 
Lesotho's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Monyane Moleleki. 
Minister Moleleki responded that he agreed with U.S. concerns 
about the unbalanced nature of the resolution's condemnation of 
Israel without mentioning Hezbollah, and stated that he would 
discuss the issue with Lesotho's Permanent Representative to the 
UN in New York.  He declined to decisively state which way 
Lesotho would vote on the issue, citing the influence of "peer 
pressure."  However, calling members of Hezbollah "thugs", he 
strongly criticized its practices as leading to the unnecessary 
deaths of Lebanese civilians.  The Ambassador stressed the 
importance of member states' ability to act independently and 
urged the GOL not to support the resolution. 
 
¶2.  Ambassador took the opportunity to brief the FOMIN on 
detainee issues (Reftel B).  Minister Moleleki stated that, to 
his chagrin, the United States was an easier target for 
criticism than the "nefarious" terrorist organizations it 
struggles against due to the fact that the U.S. is a well 
functioning state. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  A full response from the GOL covering its voting 
position is not expected right away.  The Minister indicated 
that one or two of the GOL's New York staff would be reviewing 
this matter, but did not have a specific timeframe for decision. 
 End Comment.
