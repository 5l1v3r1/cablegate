SUBJECT: SENEGAL: SHORTAGE OF HOTEL ROOMS, MAY 9 TO 16, 
2009 
 
There will be a shortage of hotel rooms in Dakar from 
May 9 to May 16, 2009 due to Senegal hosting the annual 
African Development Bank meetings. Non-emergency travel 
should not be undertaken during the above dates as there 
will be no guarantee that hotel rooms will be available.
