RESTRICTIONS 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Hebron's Mayor and business leaders told 
ConGenOffs that GOI restrictions on movement and access 
continue to stifle the city, particularly in Hebron's Old 
City and the Ibrahimi Mosque/Cave of Machpela area.  Though 
two key road obstacle removals last year facilitated 
commercial and passenger vehicle movement, the Mayor and 
local businessmen said that much more needs to be done, 
including removing key roadblocks north and south of the city 
and critical checkpoints/roadblocks in the city center.  End 
summary. 
 
Last Year's Roadblock Removals Good for Business 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a series of recent meetings with Hebron Mayor 
Khaled Osaily and prominent Hebron businessmen, all confirmed 
that two key roadblock removals last year had a significant 
positive impact on the city's businesses and residents.  They 
said that removing the two obstacles -- one at Halhul Bridge 
in northern Nablus that blocked access to the region's main 
east-west highway (Route 35), and one at al-Fahs/Kvasim 
("Sheep's Junction") that blocked access from the city's 
industrial zone to the West Bank's main north-south highway 
(Route 60) -- allowed businesses more direct access to major 
commercial arteries.  They also reduced travel time around 
the city for hundreds of thousands of residents. 
 
Old City Checkpoints "Devastating" 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mayor Osaily told ConGenOffs that roadblocks cutting 
off access to Hebron's former central shopping district 
around Shuhada Street in the Old City resulted in the closure 
of about 1,600 Palestinian shops, turning the area into "a 
ghost town."  He said that central Hebron road closures, 
curfews, and daily confrontations with local settlers have 
had a "devastating" impact on the Old City business district. 
 
 
Tsion Road: GOI Buckles to Settlers 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mayor Osaily lamented that the GOI backtracked on 
plans to allow Palestinian access to Tsion Road, the main 
thoroughfare between the Kiryat Arba settlement and the 
Ibrahimi Mosque/Cave of Machpela area, due to strong 
resistance from the local settler community.  He called May 
18, when settlers marched to protest the planned opening, "a 
dangerous day."  "The city was on the verge of a fire, just 
waiting for a spark," said the Mayor.  He said he would 
continue to press the GOI to open the road, calling it 
"significant for social and religious reasons." 
 
 
Beit Haggay and Farsh al-Hawa Roadblocks Also Top Priorities 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Mayor Osaily and business contacts cited two road 
obstacles on Hebron's outskirts, Beit Haggay and Farsh 
al-Hawa, as two top priorities for removal.  Mayor Osaily 
estimated that the Beit Haggay roadblock (on route 60 near 
the Haggay settlement) prevents nearly 200,000 Palestinians 
living in towns and villages south of Hebron from accessing 
the city via route 60.  Business leaders said that Hebron's 
major industries, including concrete, stone and marble, and 
foodstuffs, are hurt by this closure.  According to Mayor 
Osaily, the Beit Haggay roadblock cannot be justified on 
security grounds, since several roundabout alternative routes 
exist.  "It's only purpose is to make our lives difficult." 
 
¶6. (SBU) The Mayor said that removing Farsh al-Hawa roadblock 
in northwest Hebron is another priority.  This roadblock, 
said the Mayor,  prevents businesses and residents in 
northwest Hebron from directly  accessing Route 35, which 
connects that part of the city to the Tarqumiya crossing into 
Israel and to Route 60.
