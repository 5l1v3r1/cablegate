ISLAMIC PARTY CHALLENGER IN JAKARTA 
 
REF: A. JAKARTA 2085 
 
     ¶B. JAKARTA 1972 
 
¶1.  (U) According to a survey of 8000 voters by the well 
regarded Indonesian Survey Institute (LSI), Vice-Governor 
Fauzi Bowo defeated former deputy police chief Adang 
Daradjatun, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) candidate, 56 
percent to 44 percent in Jakarta's August 8 gubernatorial 
race.  LSI reported a margin of error of plus or minus one 
percent. 
 
¶2.  (U) Official results will be announced on August 18 and 
the winner inaugurated to replace Governor Sutiyoso in 
October.  In the end, Fauzi's massive coalition of virtually 
every mainstream political party appeared to have held off a 
late surge by Adang and PKS, a well-organized Islamic party. 
Despite the loss, political pundits expected PKS to spin the 
respectable showing as a sign of the party's growth. 
 
¶3.  (U) The August 8 election unfolded peacefully and without 
any reports of disturbances.  The Jakarta metropolitan police 
deployed 11,300 police across the city to maintain security 
during the election and by all accounts, these measures 
succeeded.  According to the media, officials from both camps 
expressed satisfaction with the transparency and integrity of 
the polling practices.  Embassy teams observed polling 
stations throughout the city and reported no disturbances or 
obvious signs of intimidation or coercion. 
 
¶4. (U) As predicted, turnout for the election was low by 
Indonesian standards (Note: In the 2004 parliamentary 
election, 88 percent of eligible voters voted nationally.) 
The respected Kompas newspaper estimated that only 60 percent 
of registered Jakarta voters actually cast a ballot.  As 
outlined in reftels, conventional wisdom long held that voter 
discontent with the limited options would translate into low 
turnout.
