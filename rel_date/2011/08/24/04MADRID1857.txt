     ¶B. MADRID 1806 
 
¶1. We discussed the status of Spain's pledge for Iraq 
reconstruction with Directorate General of International 
Finance Technical Adviser Ines Menendez de Luarca Bellido. 
Menendez said that her Director General and Secretary of 
State for Economy have not yet been able to discuss this 
matter with the new Vice President and Minister of Economy 
Pedro Solbes. 
 
¶2. Menendez expects this conversation to take place shortly. 
She confidently predicts Spain will begin the disbursement 
process of its 2004 multilateral pledges from the Madrid 
Donors' Conference, which include USD 20 million for the 
IRFFI and USD 5 million for the IFC Small Business Facility, 
shortly thereafter.  The bureaucratic procedure for 
assistance transfer requires approximately one month.  She 
could not offer any information on new assistance plans.
