SUBJECT: ENGAGING MUSLIM POPULATION ON "DEFAMATION OF

REF: A. A) STATE 128320 
     ¶B. B) MOSCOW 2708 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to ref A request, Post has produced a 
plan of action for engaging both the GOR and Russia's Muslim 
population with the goal of ending support for the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)'s "defamation of 
religion" resolutions in the United Nations.  During our 
October meeting with Natalia Zolotova of the MFA's Department 
of Human Rights and Humanitarian Cooperation (ref B), we 
pointed out that these resolutions provide a disturbingly 
vague definition of the terms "defamation" and "religion," 
and expressed the concern that they could become a crude tool 
in the hands of any government inclined to suppress freedom 
of speech.  Although she told us that the GOR did not intend 
to change its position on the UNGA "defamation of religion" 
resolution, Zolotova received our points with an open mind 
and offered only a half-hearted defense of the resolution. 
We believe that continued mutually respectful debate with the 
MFA on this issue will be valuable. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In addition to continuing our dialogue with the GOR, 
we also plan to meet with Muslim leaders after the January 
Russian New Year holiday, in order to promote greater 
understanding of U.S. priorities defending respect both for 
free expression and for religious sensitivities.  We intend 
to open a continuing dialogue with these leaders, and, via 
this relationship, we plan to engage Muslim youth as well. 
Working with our Public Affairs Section, we will expand 
ongoing activities that engage Muslim students at the 
American Centers and Corners, universities and high schools, 
and informal meetings with youth groups, in which we will 
exchange ideas with participants and offer the U.S. 
perspective on religious tolerance and pluralism.  Post will 
continue its ongoing policy of maximizing regional travel, 
and plans to capitalize on the Secretary's highly successful, 
widely publicized trip to the Republic of Tatarstan in 
October.  Post will continue to participate in the Access 
Microscholarship Program, a two-year after-school English 
language teaching program for teenagers from low-income 
families in regions with predominantly Muslim population.  As 
part of this program, in October 2009 (immediately following 
the Secretary's visit), Post distributed throughout Russia a 
book and CD-ROM with drawings and dramatizations entitled 
"Lessons in Kindness: Accessing English through Students' 
Stories."  Written by Russian Access students, the teaching 
materials promote tolerance and respect for different 
cultures and nationalities. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In the wake of the Tatarstan visit, on November 26 
Post received a letter from the President of Tatarstan 
suggesting broadened cooperation and exchanges between the 
U.S. and Tatarstan.  Post responded positively on December 
22, and noted that USAID has funded a Community Connections 
exchange program which will bring interfaith religious 
leaders from Tatarstan (as well as several other regions) to 
the U.S. for three to five-week homestay exchanges beginning 
in March 2010.  Two State Department International Visitor 
Leadership Programs will also bring regional religious, 
business, and education leaders from Tatarstan to the U.S. 
The December 22 letter also suggests bringing several keynote 
speakers (via the State Department's Speakers Program) to 
participate in a conference on Islam and Tolerance organized 
and hosted by the Government of Tatarstan, and increasing the 
number of American educational exchange participants in 
Tatarstan, where there are currently four Fulbright scholars, 
one Senior English Language Fellow, and nine National 
Strategic Language Initiative students.
