Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Leading media reported that DM Ehud Barak and the IDF decided to 
expedite preparations for the evacuation of the QHouse of 
Contention,Q following Tuesday's violence between settlers and 
Palestinians. Yesterday, amid general quiet, settlers broke into two 
Arab homes near the wholesale market- - the so-called Shapira House 
and Vizman House -- which they had evacuated about two and a half 
years ago after an agreement with the state.   HaQaretz reported 
that Barak was scheduled to meet with the Yesha Council of Jewish 
Settlers in the Territories today to discuss the evacuation, but he 
was quoted as saying that despite the last-ditch effort to postpone 
the house's evacuation, "we might be facing a wave of violence that 
could spread to the entire West Bank."  Maariv and other media 
reported that secret negotiations have already taken place between 
Barak and the leaders of the House of Contention.  Leading media 
reported that the leaders of the three major parties and Yisrael 
Beiteinu Chairman Avigdor Lieberman came out against hurting members 
of the security forces.  Shas refused to join them. 
 
HaQaretz quoted PM Ehud Olmert as saying yesterday that Palestinians 
in Hebron also have rights and a heritage.   HaQaretz reported that 
senior PA officials expressed concerns that the vandalism by 
settlers against Muslim mosques and cemeteries could provoke a 
revenge attack by Palestinians.  The Jerusalem Post reported that 
yesterday the PA called on the GOI to pull the settlers out of 
Hebron and that it warned that the growing tensions in the city 
could erupt into an all-out confrontation. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that visiting Congressman Robert Wexler 
(D-FL), one of President-elect Barack ObamaQs most prominent early 
supporters in the Jewish community, told the newspaper yesterday 
that there is little doubt that Obama could work well with Likud 
head Benjamin Netanyahu, should the latter become IsraelQs next 
prime minister. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that the IDF is drawing up options for a 
strike on Iranian nuclear installations that that do not include 
coordination with the U.S.  The newspaper noted that Israeli 
officials have said that it would be difficult, but not impossible, 
to launch a stake against Iran without receiving codes from the U.S. 
Air Force, which controls Iraqi airspace.  Israel also asked for the 
codes in 1991 during the First Gulf War, but the U.S. refused. 
 
Leading media reported that yesterday Knesset Member Rabbi Yitzhak 
Levy (National Union-National Religious Party) announced his 
intention to leave politics, declaring he would not run for a place 
on the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home) party list.  Israel 
Radio reported that today the Jewish Home will choose a leader. 
 
Leading media reported that yesterday dozens of activists held a 
demonstration outside AshkelonQs Shikma prison to protest the 
conditions enjoyed by Palestinian prisoners there.  The protesters 
demanded that privileges such as regular family visits be suspended 
as long as Hamas refused to allow the Red Cross or other officials 
to meet with Gilad Shalit. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that a Qatari charity group announced 
that it, too, will send a boat to Gaza. 
 
HaQaretz reported that Transportation Minister Shaul Mofaz will ask 
the U.S. not to lower the flight safety rating at Ben Gurion 
Airport. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that a new Arab party that aims to 
improve the daily lives of Arabs and promote Jewish-Arab dialogue in 
the country was officially launched yesterday.  The daily quoted 
party leader and cofounder Sheikh Abbas Zakour (United Arab 
List-TaQal) as saying that Hizb al-Wasat al-Arabi (the Arab Center 
Party) will focus on serving the day-to-day needs of Arab citizens, 
rather than on international or regional issues that are beyond 
their mandate.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: QThe silent 
majority in Israel [might receive a message from the plunderers] 
that the future of the Jewish Zionist state is being held hostage by 
[the QJewish terroristsQ] who pray for its destruction. 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
QNetanyahu, a student of American politics, knows that both 
Democrats and Republicans have made room for non-centrist voices. 
 
Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
Â¶I.  "Standing Up to Jewish Terrorism" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (12/4): QThis 
week, Israel has reached the point of no return, which will also 
determine who controls the state: the justice system and a 
government elected by democratic means, or Jewish terrorism.  If the 
government does not remove, as soon as possible and without fear of 
violence, the riotous core of settlers in Hebron, which has 
disengaged from the state and its institutions and now endangers the 
public, the blood of the victims of religious fanaticism in the 
territories will be on its hands.  No less grievous would be the 
message sent to the plunderers that they were victorious and proof 
for the silent majority in Israel that the future of the Jewish 
Zionist state is being held hostage by those who pray for its 
destruction. No other moral claim, not even the just claim of the 
Jewish people for a national home, will stand, either at home or 
abroad, against such a capitulation to terror. 
 
 
II.  "Let Feiglin Be Feiglin" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (12/4): 
QNot unreasonably, Netanyahu is worried that allowing [far Right 
Likud activist Moshe] Feiglin too high a profile will send the wrong 
message about Likud philosophy.  In our view, however, he could 
solve this problem by rejecting the advice of his handlers to stay 
vague and explicitly articulate his vision for the party.... 
Tactically, letting Israelis know where he stands on territorial 
concessions and negotiations with the Palestinians would settle the 
Likud's orientation.  Feiglin could hardly then claim, as he does 
now, that he represents the Qreal LikudQ.... Netanyahu, a student of 
American politics, knows that both Democrats and Republicans have 
made room for non-centrist voices.  Today's diverse GOP includes 
those divided over the role of government; today's Democratic Party 
includes those divided over social and personal values.
