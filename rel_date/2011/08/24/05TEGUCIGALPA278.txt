Â¶1.  Editorial in San Pedro Sula-based liberal daily "La 
Prensa" on 2/6, titled "The Day After."  "Last weekend's 
elections in Iraq represented a great relief for the 
international community, especially for the U.S. government, 
whose president counted on the free will of the Iraqi people 
despite the increasing violence in the days before the 
elections.  Votes and violence were the highlight of that 
historical day which should and must be the start of a 
better future for the distressed Iraqi people." 
 
"For that reason, after the closing of the ballot boxes, the 
key question is what will happen the day after.  Certainly 
Iraq is still many days away from achieving the 
consolidation of freedom and peace.  The day after the 
elections is just a step on the path toward stability, which 
is not around the corner and can't be achieved on a strict 
timetable." 
 
"As interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said, the terrorists 
weren't defeated with the elections, they just lost a battle 
that will be the starting point and the defining moment for 
a final victory of the Iraqi people." 
 
"Most of the EU countries that didn't believe in this 
election now have a historical responsibility to support the 
decision of the Iraqis.  It may be easy to end a war, but 
it's difficult to consolidate peace on the basis of justice 
and liberty."
