SUBJECT: KUWAIT MEDIA REACTION: IRAQI PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTIONS - WEEKEND COVERAGE 
 
¶1. Summary: Over the Kuwaiti weekend, Arabic dailies 
provided a low volume of coverage of the Iraqi parliamentary 
elections. For the most part, offering only news of wide 
participation by Sunnis. Sporadic reports of the alleged 
Iranian truck full of forged ballot boxes being seized as it 
attempted to cross into Iraq also appeared. The focus was 
mainly on the peaceful nature of the elections and the 
participation of Sunnis. End Summary.

-- Amar Taqi wrote for the moderate daily Al-Rai Al-Aam 
under the title "Allawi and the triple five list": "Today 
Iraqi voters head to the ballot boxes all over Iraq for the 
 
KUWAIT 00005165  002 OF 002 
 
 
third time this year. There are 7,000 candidates in 18 
electoral districts competing for 275 seats. This system is 
aimed to guarantee fair representation to the different 
sects and ethnic groups in parliament. These elections are 
different from the last ones held in that there is fierce 
competition, whereas the last elections were characterized 
by a relative calm. An example of the ferocity of these 
elections is the attacks that the United Iraqi Coalition 
List (555) has sustained and some of the `below the belt' 
shots from other candidate lists. The most antagonistic has 
been the National Iraqi List (731) led by the former Iraqi 
Prime Minister Eiad Allawi. All we hope for is that all 
parties refrain from forgery and that the election process 
be carried out in an honest manner so that we see the rise 
of a democratic, federal Iraq that preserves the rights of 
all of its citizens without discrimination. We are all 
hopeful that Iraqis will pay attention to their country's 
future and what is being plotted against it by the Baathists 
and Zarqawists."

-- Humaid Al-Malki wrote for the moderate daily Al-Rai Al- 
Aam under the title "Where is the Iraqi situation heading, 
and how?": "For the sake of continuing on the same path for 
Iraq to achieve its goals the participation of everyone in 
the political process on an equal footing is a must. Also, 
the basis of participation must be nationalism without any 
consideration for religion or ethnicity. Loyalty must to 
Iraq as a government and a people only. Iraqis must distance 
themselves from any and all divisions, because that is the 
only way to guarantee their safety and security as they walk 
the path of Iraqis who love their country and are loyal to 
it; those who unite for rebuilding Iraq and making it 
prosperous."
