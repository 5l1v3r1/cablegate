----------------- 
GENERAL SITUATION 
----------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) N'djamena is still tense but calm. Agence France 
Presse (AFP) reports that fighting has broken out near 
Massaguet, 60-90 miles NE of the capital. A few hundred 
Chadian riot police and various armored tanks have been seen 
moving about the city.  Chadian military aircraft have left 
the airport. There are a number of heavily armed vehicles in 
front of the presidential palace. Embassy Officers are in 
close contact with their diplomatic (French, Egyptian, 
Chinese) and UN counterparts.

EAC MTG at 1000 
--------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ambassador convened a meeting of the Emergency 
Action Committee (EAC) on February 1 at 1000 local time to 
receive update on assessments of the current security 
environment and review tripwires for Authorized Departure 
status. Key offices and personnel represented at the meeting 
included: AMB, A/DCM, DATT, POL/ECON, RSO, CONS, IPC, and 
POL/MIL. EAC decided: (a) to keep all mission personnel at 
concentrated locations and prohibit travel (b) to approve 
updated tripwires (see para 3). 
 
¶3. (SBU) The EAC agreed that the result of any military 
engagement between rebels and government forces will be an 
important factor to consider when determining if any one of 
the tripwires have been reached. The EAC agreed that as of 
1000 local time, no tripwires have been reached. 
 
---------------------------------- 
TRIPWIRES FOR AUTHORIZED DEPARTURE 
---------------------------------- 
 
-- Indications that the Government is unable to ensure order 
in the city and surrounding environment. 
 
-- Indications that prolonged uncertainty requires continued 
extreme stand fast posture for EFMs. 
 
-- Indications that French/EU move to equivalent of 
authorized departure. 
 
-- Inability to support operations because of lack of 
communications, food, electrical power, fuel, water, etc. 
 
NB: The result of any military engagement will be decisive: 
 
-- If government wins a major battle, situation will 
remain/return to normal. 
 
-- If rebels win a major battle, situation will deteriorate, 
at least in the short term.

MISSION POSTURE 
--------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) All Embassy Community personnel remain in 
consolidated positions. The Embassy has staged work crews 
available and active in facilities, computer support, 
security, health and other services at both the Chancery and 
the American compounds.  Power and utilities, except cell 
phones, appear to be functioning normally. An updated warden 
message will be released to the American Community advising 
of the situation in the city and USG security arrangements, 
as per "no double standards" policy. We will also reconvene a 
EAC at 1600 local time.
