SUBJECT: GUINEA-BISSAU'S BUDGET TRANSPARENCY IS IMPROVING 
 
REF:  STATE 28885 
 
¶1.  In response to request for clarification of host country's 
efforts to make its national budget publicly available, as per 
Section 7088(c) of the 2009 SFOAA, post provides the following 
information keyed to reftel's specific questions: 
 
¶A.  Yes, Guinea-Bissau's central government is expected to receive a 
very small amount of USG assistance that may subject it to 
restrictions under Section 70888(c) and for which a national 
interest waiver could be required; 
 
¶B.  Guinea-Bissau's annual budget is available publically to some 
degree.  The official process is fairly transparent, in theory, but 
the government has few resources available for printing costs or 
website maintenance to make the budget readily available. 
Guinea-Bissau has a very small civil society, which is largely not 
prepared to participate in discussions on the national budget.  The 
government's proposed budget is debated and approved by the National 
Assembly.  The country's FY09 budget was approved by on April 9; 
 
¶C.  Yes, projected income and expenditures are included in the draft 
budget.  However, in a country that is running a large deficit, and 
is hoping for greater donor assistance to fill its budget gap and to 
assist with basic social programs, the accuracy and execution of the 
budget is a moving target. 
 
¶2.  In determining whether or not a waiver for Guinea-Bissau should 
be required, Washington agencies should keep in mind that 
Guinea-Bissau's public administration has very little capacity.  The 
USG engagement in Guinea-Bissau is increasing, but remains very 
small in terms of actual assistance, with an estimated USD 1 million 
programmed for FY 2009. 
 
¶3.  Should a national interest waiver be required, Post requests 
that Washington agencies do so in a timely manner since our small 
programs could prove highly valuable for much-needed security sector 
reform and for the critical upcoming presidential elections 
following the March 2nd assassination of President Vieira.
