RESCHEDULED 
 
¶1. In the absence of Sudan People's Liberation Movement 
(SPLM) representatives, the 50th plenary meeting of the 
Assessment and Evaluation Commission (AEC) scheduled for 
December 8 was rescheduled to Sunday, December 13 at 10:00 
AM. For representatives of AEC member countries assembled in 
anticipation of the December 8 plenary, Commission Chairman 
Sir Derek Plumbly reviewed recent developments and 
administrative matters. Plumbly noted that the impending 
crisis discussed at the November AEC plenary had transformed 
in the intervening month into a real crisis. Specifically, 
the impasse over legislation before the National Assembly had 
continued, and had escalated into the demonstrations held the 
day before. Plumbly said he planned to address the press 
later that day,in his personal capacity, to emphasize the 
need for the parties to work together to pass the legislation 
before the close of the current parliamentary session, and to 
assure implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
(CPA) through elections conducted in a free, fair and 
peaceful manner. 
 
¶2.  Plumbly pointed out several recent, positive 
developments.  He met, at the invitation of former South 
African President Thabo Mbeki, with the members of the 
African Union High-Level Panel on Darfur to discuss the 
panel's new mandate with respect to the CPA.  Plumbly said he 
was encouraged both by the mastery of detail demonstrated by 
panel members during their conversation and by their 
determination to focus on CPA implementation.  While in 
attendance at a Juba forum on post 2011 issues, Plumbly said 
participants both understood and were committed to the need 
to begin now to engage on post referendum issues.  Finally, 
Plumbly called the registration of 3.4 million voters a 
positive development, and reminded attendees that the AEC 
will meet with members of the National Elections Commission 
on December 15 to review the registration process. 
 
¶3. Plumbly also noted that the Security Affairs Working Group 
had traveled to Equatoria, Blue Nile and Jonglei to 
investigate security in those areas, and said that the AEC 
staff would issue an expanded annual report, to mark the 
fifth anniversary of the signing of the CPA, in January 2010.
