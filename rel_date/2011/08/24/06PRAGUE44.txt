 Â¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel talking points to Czech MFA 
Afghan desk officer Michal Svoboda January 12.  Svoboda said 
the Czech Republic most likely would not be able to make a 
donor pledge to form part of the Afghanistan Compact.   He 
did say, however, that at the Jan 31 - Feb 1 Compact meeting 
in London, the GOCR will announce a separate pledge of 25 
million Czech crowns (USD 1.04 million) in humanitarian 
support for Afghanistan. He added that the Czech Republic 
would be represented at the London conference by a Deputy 
Foreign Minister (likely Dep Min for Bilateral Relations 
Tomas Pojar), since the Foreign Minister would be unavailable.
