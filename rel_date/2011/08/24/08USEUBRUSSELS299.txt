SUBJECT: EU SUPPORTS RESTRUCTURING ICG ON SOMALIA 
 
REF: STATE 16168 
 
¶1. (SBU) The European Union is largely in favor of the U.S. 
proposal to strengthen the effectiveness of the International 
Contact Group on Somalia, with the caveat that it would like 
to convene plenary sessions approximately four times a year. 
Poloff delivered reftel points to Jean-Christophe Belliard 
and Ragnheidur Roubineau of the Council Secretariat's Africa 
Unit and Michele Cervone, European Commission Desk Officer 
for Somalia, all of whom expressed general agreement with the 
proposal.  Belliard and Cervone said they are encouraged by 
the outlook and actions of the new Somali PM and believe it 
is a good time to pressure the TFG to implement reforms 
outlined last August at the National Reconciliation Congress. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Belliard said he opposes expanded ICG membership and 
would like to limit membership to the EU, U.S., UN, AU, Arab 
League, Tanzania and the current European members (Norway, 
Sweden, UK, Italy). Sweden has circulated a draft proposal of 
its own to fellow EU members UK and Italy for restructuring 
the ICG, but EU officials said it is very similar to the U.S. 
proposal except that it calls for plenary meetings four times 
per year.  Belliard, Roubineau, and Cervone fully supported 
the concept of cluster groups based in Nairobi.  They also 
support having the UN chair the ICG.
