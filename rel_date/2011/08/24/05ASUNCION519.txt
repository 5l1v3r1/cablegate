¶1. On 4/13, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Jose Martinez 
Lezcano told the press that the GOP had demanded an official 
explanation from the GOV regarding the 4/8 assault on 
Paraguayan Ambassador to Venezuela Ana Maria Figueredo in 
Caracas (reftel).  Martinez noted that the GOP provides 
security for Venezuela's Ambassador to Paraguay and the 
Venezuelan Embassy in Asuncion, and questioned why the GOV 
does not provide the same for Paraguay's Ambassador and 
Embassy in Caracas.  Although Martinez indicated that the GOP 
would not recall Ambassador Figueredo in protest, Figueredo 
indicated that she had spoken to FM Rachid, and that Rachid 
suggested Figueredo leave Caracas until the GOV satisfies the 
demands Figueredo and the GOP have presented. 
 
¶2. Additionally, Senator Miguel Carrizosa, President of 
Paraguay's Congress, sent a letter to his Venezuelan 
counterpart, Nicolas Maduro Moro, condemning the assault, 
demanding an official explanation, and highlighting the lack 
of security for Figueredo and the Embassy. 
 
¶3. On 4/16, Venezuelan Ambassador to Paraguay Jose Huerta 
Castillo claimed during a radio interview that the U.S. had 
financed the assault, building on his earlier assertion that 
unnamed opponents of President Hugo Chavez were responsible 
for the incident (reftel).
