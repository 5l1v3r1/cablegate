SUBJECT: ABBAS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT BEN ALI 
 
Â¶1. On August 9, all Tunisian newspapers carried an official 
GOT press agency report of a meeting between visiting 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Tunisian President 
Ben Ali.  Abbas visited Tunisia August 7 - 8.  According to 
the report, the two discussed the situation in the 
Palestinian territories, which Abbas reportedly described as 
"no less tragic than Lebanon", the current draft UN security 
resolution on Israel and Lebanon, and the possibility of an 
upcoming emergency Arab League Summit.  Abbas and Ben Ali 
also reportedly discussed Tunisian-Palestinian bilateral and 
cultural relations and "questions of political order", 
especially "the possibility of coordination of the Tunisian 
and Palestinian positions" on relations with the U.S. and 
Europe.  According to press reports, Abbas was accompanied by 
Nabil Abour Roudeina, Advisor to the Palestinian President, 
as well as the Palestinian Ambassador in Tunis.  Tunisian 
editorials predictably heralded Tunisia and Ben Ali's 
"infallible support" for the Palestinian people, especially 
in the "difficult and tragic times following the Israeli 
aggression."
