SUBJECT: JANUARY 7 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: 
 
¶1. Key points at the January 7 MFA press briefing were: 
 
-- China opposes the use of sanctions against Iran and believes 
nuclear proliferation concerns should be resolved through diplomatic 
channels. 
 
-- Japan's territorial claim to the "reef" in the East China Sea 
goes against the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the common 
interests of the international community. 
 
-- China firmly opposes U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, which it believes 
are inconsistent with the three Joint Communiques, especially the 
August 17 Communique. 
 
-- MFA Spokeswoman Jiang Yu was not aware that Tibetan film maker 
Dhondup Wangchen had been sentenced to prison but claimed that "only 
those who break the law are punished." 
 
-- China and Taiwan will begin negotiating ECFA on January 20. 
 
 
 
-- Information about Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei's transfer and 
end of term will be available "in due course." 
 
Iran Sanctions 
--------------- 
 
¶2.  At the January 7 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Jiang Yu said that, as Chinese Ambassador to 
the UN Zhang Yesui had already stated, China opposes the use of 
sanctions against Iran.  China believed resolution of the Iran 
nuclear issue should be pursued through diplomatic channels and 
hoped that the nations concerned do not abandon diplomatic efforts. 
Jiang urged "flexibility" in reaching a resolution. 
 
Japanese Territorial Claims 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. Japan's claims to the "reef" in the East China Sea (although 
Jiang did not identify them by name she may have been referring to 
the Diaoyutai/Senkaku Islands) violate both the UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea and the "common interests" of the international 
community.  Building structures on the disputed "reef" will not 
change its legal status, Jiang said. 
 
Arms Sales to Taiwan 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. China firmly opposed U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, Jiang said.  Arms 
sales run contrary to the three Joint Communiques, especially the 
August 17 Communique, asserted Jiang.  The United States should stop 
selling arms to Taiwan since arms sales undermine "overall 
cooperation" between the United States and China. 
 
Dhondup Wangchen Sentence 
------------------------- 
 
¶5. Asked about the December 28 sentencing of filmmaker Dhondup 
Wangchen, Jiang said she was not aware of any prison sentence being 
handed down in the case.  However, she asserted that Chinese 
citizens enjoy freedom of speech and equal treatment before the law. 
 "Only those who break the law are punished," Jiang said. 
 
Cross-Strait Economic Talks 
---------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Jiang announced that China and Taiwan would begin negotiations 
on the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) on January 
¶20. 
 
Software Piracy 
--------------- 
 
¶7. In response to an inquiry about the reports that Green Dam 
software had been pirated from a U.S. firm, Jiang stated that China 
"highly values and fully respects" intellectual property rights and 
opposes computer software piracy. 
 
He Yafei 
-------- 
 
¶8. When asked if Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, whose end of term 
had been announced by the State Council on January 4, had been 
removed from his post for poor performance, Jiang replied that 
information will become available "in due course."

¶9. China's Minister of Commerce Chen Deming would travel to 
Mozambique January 13-14 in the capacity of special envoy to attend 
the inauguration of President Armando Guebuza, Jiang announced.
