SUBJECT: TURKISH MILITARY COURT ISSUES FIRST CONVICTION OF 
ACTIVE DUTY GENERAL 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) In its first sentencing of an active-duty general 
officer, a Turkish military court convicted Third Army 
Commander, and previous ISAF Commander, GEN Erdem Erdagi of 
misusing his authority by accepting a bribe for the award of 
a military construction tender during his 2002 to 2004 
command of the 8th Corps in Elazig.  Erdagi was fined and 
sentenced on May 10 to eleven months and 25 days in prison -- 
five days short of the 12 month sentence threshold which 
carries a penalty of mandatory dismissal from the military. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Erdagi, who is well-respected for his leadership of 
ISAF VII from February through August 2005, was one of 
several military commanders -- but the only active-duty 
general -- charged together with a number of lower-ranking 
officers during a 2003-2004 crackdown on corruption by former 
Chief of Staff GEN Hilmi Ozkok.  The majority were accused in 
military contract award cases.  In addition to Erdagi, two 
retired general officers were convicted.  Former Naval Forces 
Commander ADM Ilhami Erdil was accused of directing military 
contracts to a firm headed by his daughter and a friend and 
for excessive personal spending.  Erdil had acquired two 
penthouse apartments valued at $1.25M, significantly 
exceeding the salary of a general officer.  He received a 2.5 
year prison sentence, was stripped of military privileges and 
his houses were seized.  ADM Aydin Gurul was sentenced to 
five months in prison for profiting from a military contract. 
 Both Erdagi and Gurul have appealed the decisions in their 
cases.  According to press reports, ADM Erdil is serving his 
sentence but is preparing to request a review of his case by 
the European Court of Human Rights. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: The military investigations begun under GEN 
(r) Ozkok were unprecedented in Turkish history.  Ozkok, who 
was perceived to have a good working relationship with the 
ruling Justice and Development Party which rode to power in 
2002 in part on a corruption-free image, may have wanted to 
demonstrate that the military should be held to that same, 
high standard.  While GEN Buyukanit, the current Chief of 
Staff, might not have instigated such investigations himself, 
he is perceived to hold the same high standard for the 
military and is expected to uphold the military court 
decisions in these cases.  END COMMENT.
