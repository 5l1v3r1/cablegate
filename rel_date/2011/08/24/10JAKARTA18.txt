¶1.  This cable contains an action request - see paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Summary:  We recommend that Indonesia be more strongly 
represented at the President's Entrepreneurship Summit in Washington 
in April.  Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim-majority country, 
the third largest democracy, and the third fastest growing economy 
in the G-20.  Entrepreneurs and business leaders wield significant 
influence in shaping Indonesia's political and economic future. 
Indonesia is enthusiastic to cooperate on entrepreneurship; 
government officials and business leaders have already expressed 
interest in hosting a follow-on Entrepreneurship Summit in 
Indonesia.  A more proportional representation of Indonesian 
participants would also deepen the impact of President Obama's 
highly-anticipated visit to Indonesia later this year.  End Summary. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Indonesia has made an unprecedented transformation over 
the past ten years from authoritarian dictatorship to the world's 
largest Muslim-majority democracy.  It has turned back threats of 
terrorism and separatism to become a model for religious freedom, 
woman's rights and diversity.  Indonesia's proposed inclusion in the 
G-20 recognizes its economic achievements.  Enhancing our engagement 
through entrepreneurship will highlight our links to fast-growing 
Asian markets that are critical for U.S. growth.  Inclusion of 
additional entrepreneurs from Indonesia will also strengthen our 
partnership with an increasingly influential Muslim-majority country 
that shares our democratic values.
