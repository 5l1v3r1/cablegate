¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly.  It was coordinated with Consulate 
General Surabaya. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The GOI is intercepting a rising number 
of migrants on their way to Australia.  Over 100 Afghan 
migrants were detained in two tranches on November 14.  In 
the meantime, Sri Lankan migrants, who arrived in groups of 
78 and 255 in October, remain on their ships close to shore 
at sites in Sumatra and Java, respectively.  Immigration 
officials continue to work closely with UNHCR and IOM to 
process the asylum seekers.  Concerned that the numbers of 
migrants from conflict-impacted regions will only grow,  the 
GOI is working with Australia on a longer term solution to 
the problem.  END SUMMARY. 
 
UPTICK IN NUMBER OF MIGRANTS 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Indonesia is dealing with an uptick in migrants. 
Indonesian immigration officials have told poloff that the 
GOI has intercepted more irregular migrants en route to 
Australia this year than in previous years.  The GOI is 
tabulating figures on the exact number of migrants and will 
pass them to Mission when available. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In the meantime, two separate tranches of Afghan 
migrants were detained on November 14.  One group was 
detained off of Rote Island in eastern Indonesia and the 
other off of Banten Province, Java Island.  The police 
reportedly had to fire on the group of 61 in eastern 
Indonesia in order to stop them from moving their boat 
further out to sea.  The group of 41 was detained as they 
were boarding a fishing boat off of Banten.  The police 
transferred the migrants to local immigration detention 
centers.  Officials in Rote Island and Banten are scrambling 
for funds to feed and house the detainees. 
 
UPDATE ON SRI LANKAN MIGRANTS 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  As reported reftel, two groups of Sri Lankan 
irregular migrants were intercepted by Indonesian authorities 
in October.  The first group of 250 is still on a cargo ship 
in West Java.  Although several members have disembarked for 
medical treatment, the majority remain on board waiting for 
the GOI to clarify their legal status.  In south Sumatra, a 
group of 78 Sri Lankans was taken into port in late October. 
The UNHCR is processing the 22 who left their ship late last 
week.  The IOM, in coordination with the GOI, is providing 
food for both groups. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Indonesian immigration officials, in coordination 
with Interpol, the national police and the navy, continue to 
work closely with UNHCR and IOM to process the asylum 
seekers.  The GOI is also working with Australia on a longer 
term plan to deal with the problem.  GOI and local officials 
are deeply concerned about the increasing inflow of asylum 
seekers, noting that supplies, housing and funds are not 
adequate to deal with the growing problem.  Local officials 
are hopeful that Indonesia and Australia will develop a 
workable plan to stem the flow.
