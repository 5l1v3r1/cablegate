¶2. (SBU) Although there were no terrorist incidents in 
Ukraine this year, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) claimed to 
have disrupted a domestic plot still in the planning stages. 
The MOI detained five men accused of plotting to assassinate 
the leader of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis (the unofficial Muslim 
Crimean Tatar community representative body). The men, some 
of whom are Crimean Tatars, claimed they are members of 
Egypt-based Al-Takfir wa al-Hijrah and had acquired weapons 
and explosives in preparation for the assassination attempt. 
The men are charged with illegal possession of weapons and 
explosives.  The extent of the group's links to outside 
terrorist organizations remains unclear. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Uzbekistan-based terrorist organization 
Hizb-ut-Tahir, through its local NGO Crimean Muslim Community 
Davet, held a conference on July 19 in Simferopol titled 
"From Capitalist Oppression and Injustice to the Light of the 
Caliphate."  The conference's 800 attendees were primarily 
Crimean Tatars from Ukraine and Uzbekistan.  The Ukrainian 
government said it monitored the conference closely and 
allowed it to continue because it was conducted by a 
registered NGO and its focus was on "social and religious 
issues" facing the Tatar community. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In December, President Yushchenko vetoed significant 
amendments to Ukraine's law on money-laundering and terrorist 
financing.  The law would have expanded the scope of current 
financial monitoring and would have been a demonstrable step 
toward bringing Ukraine's money-laundering and terrorism 
finance laws into compliance with international norms. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Ukrainian government continues to contribute to 
the stabilization efforts in Afghanistan, with ten soldiers 
serving in Chaghcharan province under Lithuanian leadership. 
The Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council announced 
on December 12 that the government plans to triple the size 
of its deployment to Afghanistan in 2010.
