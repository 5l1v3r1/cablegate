REF: STATE 79617 
 
(SBU) Mission delivered reftel Zimbabwe demarche to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 28.  In the absence of 
the Foreign Minister (now on two weeks leave, as other 
members of the cabinet), IO Chief Ben Rutsinga agreed that 
the "best" result would be the retirement from active 
political life of President Mugabe, and the holding of new 
elections in the near future.  A "soft-landing" for Mugabe, 
with an "honorable" departure, would be required, he 
suggested.  Rutsinga said that if, as part of a political 
settlement, Mugabe remained as head of ZANU-PF, he would 
"continue to lead the country" to the detriment of the 
Zimbabwean people.  However, after offering these thoughts, 
Rutsinga cautioned that the GOR would not "get out in front 
of" the African Union position on Zimbabwe nor the SADC/Mbeki 
facilitation of talks.
