SUBJECT: EL KADI'S ASSETS REMAIN FROZEN IN TURKEY 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On April 2, the Administrative Court Council 
rejected the appeal of Saudi national Yassin el Kadi to 
release his frozen assets.  El Kadi had appealed to vacate an 
earlier decision by the Danistay, or Council of State, that 
reconfirmed the authority of the Turkish Government to freeze 
his assets. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Nalan Terzi, Senior Judge at the Administrative 
Court Council, informed us that el Kadi's assets will remain 
frozen and the court's decision is binding.  El Kadi's assets 
in Turkey were first frozen on 12/22/2001, implementing a 
United Nations Security Council decision.  Despite subsequent 
attempts by el Kadi to gain release of his assets, they have 
remained frozen since December 2001.
