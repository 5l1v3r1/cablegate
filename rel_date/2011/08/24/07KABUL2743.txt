SUBJECT: POLAND TO CONSIDER A PRT IN AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The Polish Government will soon consider whether 
to stand up a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Afghanistan. 
Internal discussions will begin in Warsaw on August 17.  Polish 
diplomats in Kabul have met with Embassy PRT director to sound out 
initial USG thoughts.  Based on input from Department, USNATO and 
CJTF-82, we have encouraged them to proceed with their 
deliberations, while stressing that it would be a serious, 
resource-intensive national commitment that will need to be worked 
through NATO/ISAF. The Poles responded that they heard our message 
"loud and clear," that any PRT would be a wholly Polish effort and 
that they are well aware that there is a great deal of work ahead. 
END SUMMARY 
¶2. (SBU) On August 11, Polish Military Attache Colonel Pyotr 
Lukasiewicz met with PRT Director to discuss the potential 
establishment of a Polish PRT.  Lukasiewicz stressed that Warsaw is 
at the start of a long process and that no decision has yet been 
made.  If a PRT is established, the Poles would want to co-locate it 
with their maneuver battalion in Paktika province. There is a US-led 
PRT in northern Paktika, but geography and distance make it 
difficult to operate effectively throughout the province.  The Poles 
state that their soldiers have been successful in reaching out and 
making contacts and want to deepen these relationships through 
development efforts.  They also noted that locating the PRT with the 
battle group would be politically welcome in Poland. 
¶3. (SBU) Lukasiewicz returned August 15 to follow up. Based on input 
from the Department, USNATO and CJTF-82, PRT Director urged them to 
proceed with their deliberations.  He stated that they would need to 
work closely with SHAPE, NATO and ISAF.  Additionally, a 
"sub-provincial" PRT would need to coordinate with the "lead PRT," a 
move which might include Political Officers assigned to both 
entities.  PRT Director also commented that a PRT is a long-term 
commitment requiring adequate funding.  Also, Poland would have to 
take on the effort itself and not look to the U.S. for significant 
support. 
¶4. (SBU) Lukasiewicz stated that he had heard our cautions "loud and 
clear." He reiterated that no decision had been made.  He took on 
our points about coordination with SHAPE/NATO/ISAF, commenting that 
Poland had been in the Alliance long enough to understand that much 
hard work lay ahead.  He assured us that Warsaw understood that this 
had to be a Polish effort and that they could not look to others for 
help.  His next step will be a series of visits with ISAF and 
CJTF-82 to flesh out details and elicit advice.  He promised to keep 
us apprised of his efforts. 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  This is a positive step.  While the Poles have a 
great deal of work ahead of them, we believe that they should be 
encouraged.  We will have the opportunity to shape and direct their 
efforts as needed to meet the situation on the ground.
