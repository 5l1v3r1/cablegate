In Today's Papers 
 
New Judicial Year Opens in Turkey 
All papers report President Abdullah Gul, Parliament Speaker Koksal 
Toptan and Prime Minister Erdogan as well as cabinet ministers 
participated in a ceremony held Thursday on the occasion of the 
opening of the new judicial year.  Osman Arslan, Chief Judge of the 
Supreme Court of Appeals (Yargitay,) said in opening remarks that 
separatist terror "supported by overseas centers" still prevailed in 
Turkey.  "All countries have an obligation to take preemptive 
measures to block transfer of their weapons to terrorist 
organizations," said Arslan, emphasizing the failure to do so would 
imply "clear support to the terrorists."  Several papers comment 
Arslan's remarks were a indirect referral to the US. 
 
Also addressing the ceremony, Ozdemir Ozok, chairman of the Turkish 
Bars' Union, criticized the fact that the AKP government's 
constitutional amendment work has been carried out secretly.  "We 
hope that the draft will be made public soon.  We want a 
constitution which favors full independence, unity and 
democratization, and one which does not deny the founding philosophy 
and values of Turkey to be prepared under social compromise," said 
Ozok. 
 
Survey: Turks' Alienation Growing 
All papers report the results of the German Marshall Fund's 
"Transatlantic Trends Survey" shows Turks are distrustful of other 
countries and that only 26 percent believe that the country will 
enter the European Union.  A majority of Turks, 54 percent, viewed 
EU leadership as undesirable, a seven percent increase from 2006. 
The survey found 74 percent of Turks considered US leadership in 
world affairs undesirable and only 3 percent approved of President 
Bush's handling of international policies.  On a 100-point 
thermometer scale, positive sentiments toward the US dropped to 11 
from 20 degrees in 2006 and feelings toward the EU cooled to 26 
degrees from 45.  The survey also found Turkish support for NATO 
declines, with only 35 percent seeing the alliance as essential to 
Turkey's security, compared to 44 percent last year.  Turks' 
positive sentiments toward Iran also dropped to 30 degrees from 43. 
Papers report the results revealed Turkey's growing isolation from 
the East and West, with mainstream Sabah saying it "displays the 
psychology of Turks: Turks don't like anyone and are negative to the 
EU". 
 
Turkish Suspect Arrested in Germany Linked to "Milli Gorus" 
Cumhuriyet reports on its front page that Adem Y., a Turk arrested 
in Germany alongside two other suspects for plotting attacks on the 
US base in Ramstein and Frankfurt Airport, had ties with the 
Germany-based "Milli Gorus" (National View) organization.  The paper 
also carries a report by the Department for Protection of German 
Constitution which says 27,250 of 32,150 fundamentalist 
organizations in Germany were of Turkish origin.  The majority of 
these organizations are members of Milli Gorus, and they also have 
ties with the al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Milli Gorus 
aims at creating Islamic regimes although they use moderate rhetoric 
in meetings open to public, according to the report which sees the 
radicalization of Islam as the gravest threat to security and 
stability in Europe, says Cumhuriyet. 
 
Syria Accuses Israel of Bombing its Territory 
Sabah, Milliyet, Radikal, Yeni Safak and others:  Syrian news agency 
SANA claimed that the Israeli warplanes violated Syrian airspace and 
bombed deserted areas in Syria.  Speaking to SANA, a Syrian military 
spokesman said that Syrian air defenses opened fire on Israeli 
planes which had entered Syrian airspace through the northern border 
coming from the direction of the Mediterranean.  Islamist oriented 
Yeni Safak reports that Prime Minister Erdogan denied the 
allegations that the Israeli war planes took off from a base in 
Turkey.

A Call from Ambassador Sensoy to Jewish Institutions in the US 
Radikal and Sabah reported that Turkish Ambassador to the US Nabi 
Sensoy called on all Jewish institutions in the US to support Turkey 
in the Congress during the debates on Armenian Resolution and 
prevent the draft passing the Congress. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Iraq 
Kubilay Celik writes in the nationalist Tercuman:  "The most 
discussed issue in the US Congress and among the public recently is 
troop withdrawal from Iraq.  It is almost certain that the US will 
withdraw its troops from Iraq -- the main issue is when and how. 
Some are concerned that the Iraqi people will suffer heavily from 
the lack of authority after the withdrawal.  Nevertheless, the fact 
is that following the UK withdrawal, the US will withdraw too. 
There are allegations that the US will not pull out of Iraq 
completely, however, it is a well-known fact that the US, which 
occupied Iraq in 2003, will leave a ruined Iraq behind it.  In 
short, the US will pull out of Iraq at the end but the civil war in 
Iraq will never end.  And President Bush's name will be registered 
as the President who made the most mistakes in US history."
