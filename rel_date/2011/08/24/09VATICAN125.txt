Summary 
 
------- 
 
¶1.  Summary: (SBU) Caritas Internationalis, the international 
federation of national Caritas groups (Catholic 
Church-affiliated aid organizations), will send a large 
delegation to Copenhagen to press for strong action on climate 
change.  Caritas will also promote its "Grow Climate Justice" 
campaign that brings together more than 170 Catholic 
organizations worldwide.  While disappointed about USG pessimism 
regarding odds for a binding agreement, Caritas is optimistic 
about prospects for other tangible results, particularly 
financial and technical support for less developed countries. 
Caritas involvement should translate into the mobilization of 
one of the world's most extensive charity networks in support of 
follow-up to Copenhagen.  End summary. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During a November 24 meeting with P/EOff, Caritas 
Director of Communications Patrick Nicholson said Caritas was 
taking the Copenhagen Summit very seriously.  Lesley-Anne 
Knight, Caritas' Secretary General (based in Rome), will lead 
Caritas' 40-plus member delegation.  During the summit, Caritas 
will stress with participants the "Grow Climate Justice" 
campaign. The campaign has three objectives:  (1) to convince 
countries to recognize and protect all peoples' right to 
sustainable development, prioritizing the most vulnerable, (2) 
to persuade industrialized countries to provide developing 
countries sufficient, accessible, financial and technological 
support for adaptation and mitigation, and (3) to lobby 
industrialized countries to commit to at least 30-40 percent 
reduction in emissions by 2020 (based on 1990 levels). 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Holy See will send its own delegation to 
Copenhagen.  Depending on the participation of other world 
leaders, Secretary of State (Prime Minister-equivalent) Tarcisio 
Bertone may lead the Vatican group.  Also on the Vatican's 
delegation will be Cardinal Keith O'Brien, the head of the 
Scottish Conference of Catholic Bishops, who has led Vatican 
delegations to previous international environmental meetings. 
O'Brien recently stated that "Wealthy countries have an 
unequivocal moral duty to reduce their own emissions and help 
developing countries who are already suffering the consequences 
of our profligate use of fossil fuels for economic gain." 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Nicholson said Caritas would consider Copenhagen a 
success if developing economies are involved in the decision 
making process, and if participants reach agreements that bring 
about tangible results.  He said most within Catholic charity 
circles understand the U.S. position going into the Summit, 
though some are disappointed that the USG believes a binding 
international agreement on emissions is unlikely.  At the same 
time, Caritas appreciates U.S. transparency on this issue, which 
reduces the possibility of a "successful" agreement failing 
later if parties do not live up to their commitments. 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Together with the Pope (reftel), Caritas is working to 
educate and mobilize global leaders and societies about climate 
change.  Caritas believes the effects of climate change magnify 
many of the problems facing the world's poor (i.e., droughts, 
famine, internally displaced people, war, etc.).  Caritas 
appreciates U.S. efforts to advance the agenda while stressing 
that the summit must be quickly followed by further, concrete 
actions.   End Comment.
