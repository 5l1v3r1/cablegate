SUBJECT: NOMINATION OF LARISSA FILIMONOVA-KRIVTSOVA FOR ESTH COURSE 
 
Ref:  State 15409 
 
¶1.  (U) Post very much appreciates the opportunity to nominate FSN 
Larissa Filimonova-Krivtsova to attend to the two-week Environment, 
Science, Technology and Health (ESTH) course (PE 21) for FSNs from 
April 27-May 8 at NFATC.  Post is prepared to fund her airfare, 
meals, and incidental expenses and local transportation. 
 
¶2.  Ms Filimonova-Krivtsova is currently a FSN-9/3 Scientific 
Affairs Specialist, State Department employee.  Her DOB is 22 
February 1967, and she is a citizen of the Russian Federation.  At 
present, she does possess a valid passport for travel.  She has 
applied for a new one and is hoping to have received it in time for 
travel.  FSI should be aware, however, that there is a possibility 
that it might not be issued on time.  Her supervisor is EST officer 
Michael Dunkley (email: DunkleyML@state.gov, tel. 7-495-728-5156). 
 
 
¶3.  Ms Filimonova-Krivtsova has a five-year bachelor's degree in 
philosophy from Byelorussian State University and a joint master's 
degree in philosophy from Moscow State University and the Sorbonne. 
She has been working as an FSN in the Embassy's EST section since 23 
January 2007, and was previously employed as an FSN with USAID's 
human resources for 11 years as a Travel Assistant.  Currently, she 
is one of three FSNs specializing on science and technology and 
space issues in EST (the other two have already received FSI ESTH 
training).  She serves as the principal advisor to EST Counselor and 
staff on U.S. Russian science cooperation in space, nanotechnology, 
and high and innovative technologies.  She researches, analyzes and 
reports on these technical subjects, including on the Russian Global 
Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and its interoperability with 
U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS).  She has been actively 
involved in preparations for an upcoming visit by the Russian State 
Corporation on Nanotechnologies (Rusnano) to the United States in 
May to visit with industry leaders and Washington officials.  Ms 
Filimonova-Krivtsova is the primary back-up for basic science and 
telecommunications and secondary back-up for environment and health 
issues. 
¶4.  Post believes that Ms Filimonova-Krivtsova would benefit 
tremendously from this course, in particular from learning 
tradecraft skills in note-taking, drafting in English, interviewing 
and briefing.  She is interested in having consultations at the 
Department to meet the players in OES and EEB involved in these 
issues.  U.S.-Russian cooperation on ESTH issues benefits both our 
nations and the world.  Over the coming months, Embassy Moscow is 
exploring ways to strengthen and expand our bilateral science 
cooperation.  Ms Filimonova-Krivtsova is an integral part of our 
science and technology team whose value to the EST section would be 
greatly enhanced by this training and exposure to the Department's 
science offices.  Ms. Filimonova-Krivtsova has never had any prior 
FSI or USG training.
