SUBJECT:  REGIONAL ENDORSEMENT FOR FY08 1206 PROPOSAL FOR PACOM 
REGION 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Chiefs of Mission of Embassies Manila, Jakarta, 
Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Dhaka and Colombo fully support 
the FY2008 regional proposal developed by U.S. Pacific Command 
(USPACOM).  This year's $143 million package builds upon last year's 
submission to improve regional maritime security from the Indian 
Ocean to the Philippines and partner countries' surveillance, 
cross-border communication and interdiction capabilities.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) DOD and State officials from Embassies Manila, Jakarta, 
Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Dhaka and Colombo, in 
collaboration with USPACOM, have developed a regional 1206 proposal 
designed to further develop host-nation capabilities to counter 
terrorist threats in South and Southeast Asia.  The FY08 proposal 
builds upon our efforts in FY06, which established a capacity to 
protect the Strait of Malacca and Sri Lankan coastal waters, and in 
FY07, which extended this capacity in the Sulu and Sulawesi Seas in 
the border region shared by the Philippines, Indonesia, and 
Malaysia.  This area is a priority in the war against terrorism in 
Southeast Asia. 
 
¶3.   (SBU) Our FY08 proposal ensures a high degree of synergy among 
specific country programs, including uniformity of equipment and 
systems in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia, to establish a 
seamless interface among their respective maritime security efforts. 
 Three years on, Section 1206 assistance has moved from 
high-priority, but largely isolated, strategies to a synchronized 
regional effort.  We envision using Foreign Military Financing (FMF) 
and other sources to sustain programs initiated in this year's and 
previous 1206 packages. 
 
PROVIDING BASIC CAPABILITIES 
 
¶4.   (SBU) Our regional FY08 Section 1206 proposal consists of an 
agreed upon list of 24 projects ranked in priority order.  Our 
missions have worked closely with host-country officials to identify 
these projects and ensure host-country endorsement.  The focus of 
our effort is to improve the basic capabilities -- domain awareness, 
communications, and interdiction -- targeted in our FY06 and FY07 
programs: 
 
-- Domain Awareness.  Countries in the region have difficulty 
monitoring the volume, identity and nature of the ship traffic in 
their waters.  Our proposal emphasizes, even more than previous 
years, the installation of land-based and sea-based maritime radars 
and other types of surveillance and identification equipment in the 
tri-border area of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines and 
other key points between Sri Lanka and the Philippines to monitor 
vessels suspected of carrying terrorists, weapons, or drugs, as well 
as engaging in human trafficking and other illegal activities.  If 
necessary these systems can link to similar systems elsewhere in the 
region.  In addition, this year's proposal establishes for the first 
time some basic capabilities in air surveillance. 
 
-- Communications:  Despite improvements achieved through our FY07 
proposal, countries in the region still have only limited abilities 
to share information and intelligence with each other or with U.S. 
counterparts.  This shortcoming sharply limits their ability to 
track and pursue ships across maritime borders.  The FY08 proposal 
establishes additional communication centers at strategic points in 
the region, which will provide them the capacity to interoperate 
with existing U.S. networks, and facilitate data sharing between 
tactical forces and national headquarters. 
 
-- Interdiction.  Countries in the region have a growing, but still 
spotty, ability to inspect and interdict suspect ships.  This year's 
proposal also provides small craft and other interdiction equipment 
to enable military forces in the region to board and inspect ships 
thought to be carrying contraband.  Our FY06 and FY07 proposals 
contained capabilities in this area, but those capabilities 
generally received lower prioritization and, unfortunately, largely 
went unfunded.  Our progress in building domain awareness and 
communications capacity through FY06 and FY07 assistance now makes 
improving interdiction capacity a logical next step for FY08. 
 
BUILDS ON EXISTING PROGRAMS 
 
¶5. (SBU) Our proposal maximizes the use of existing U.S. military

exercises in the region, as well as initiatives managed by other 
agencies.  We have worked closely with USPACOM, Special Operations 
Command Pacific, U.S. Pacific Fleet, Joint Interagency Task Force 
West (JIATF-W) and other commands to ensure that PACOM planners 
understand our 1206 objectives and develop realistic scenarios in 
future exercises that will help host nations test and improve their 
new capabilities. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) We intend the FY08 proposal to complement other USG 
non-defense efforts to encourage and enable countries in the region 
to think and act multilaterally to address common problems.  We 
designed our proposal to support other U.S. counterterrorism 
initiatives, including S/CT's Border Control Assessment Initiative 
in the tri-border area and anticipated funding for INL's Philippine 
National Police Maritime unit.  Various aspects also dovetail with 
similar and related initiatives under way by other donor countries, 
including Japan, Australia, India and New Zealand, as well as other 
multinational initiatives such as the Trilateral Initiative on 
Counterterrorism involving the United States, Australia and Japan. 
Officials from the Department of Homeland Security, JIATF-W, and the 
Australian Ministry of Defense participated as observers in the 
development of the FY08 proposal. 
 
¶7. (SBU) We recognize the importance of host-nation responsibility 
for operations and maintenance of the capabilities provided in this 
proposal.  Where necessary, but only as interim steps, the use of 
other programs such as FMF ensures no lapse in achieved capabilities 
until host nations can assume this responsibility.  We also continue 
to rely on other U.S. non-defense assistance programs, particularly 
to maritime police and other border-control forces, in providing 
relevant equipment, particularly in the area of interdiction. Given 
that Section 1206 does not cover non-military security forces, these 
non-defense assistance programs prove critical to supporting the 
overall success of USG combating terrorism efforts. 
 
IN ACCORD WITH KEY U.S. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES 
 
¶8. (SBU) Combating terrorism and promoting regional stability in 
South and Southeast Asia are U.S. national priorities.  Section 1206 
assistance is a central component of USG efforts to achieve these 
objectives.  To the extent that we can build basic maritime 
interdiction capacity in host nations through 1206 assistance, our 
partners in South and Southeast Asia will be better able to 
contribute to and support U.S. counterterrorism objectives.
