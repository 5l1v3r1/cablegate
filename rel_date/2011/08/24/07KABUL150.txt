¶1. Post is grateful for the hard work and support from our 
colleagues in SCA/RA, SCA/A and DRL and their efforts on helping us 
with Leahy vetting for the Afghan National Security Forces. 
 
¶2. We extend kudos and recognition to Jerry Brennig, Sandra Ingram, 
and Amy Schmisseur in DRL for helping post vet over 800 officers in 
the Afghan National Police (ANP) for placement in critical positions 
throughout the country. 
 
¶3. Continued support at this level from our Washington colleagues 
will be needed for several more months as we accelerate the process 
of staffing critical security positions throughout Afghanistan in 
advance of the anticipated Taliban offensive this Spring.
