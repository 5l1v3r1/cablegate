REF: STATE 93916 
 
(SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Spanish MFA Deputy 
Director General for International Technical Organizations 
Enrique Yturriaga on July 11.  Yturriaga told Poloff that 
Spain supports the two-term limit, and that any candidate who 
did not have the support of his own country would have 
difficulty gaining the support of other nations.  Regarding 
the candidacy of Ambassador Swing, Yturriaga said that he 
would consult with Spain's mission in Geneva and a decision 
would be made closer to the election.  He said, however, that 
certain IOM members that are developing countries had 
objections to continuing U.S. preeminence in IOM, viewing the 
organization as mainly a vehicle for U.S. interests.  He 
added that Spain generally supports the rotation of important 
offices among geographic groups, though he could not say 
definitively if that would be the case with IOM, which Spain 
has only recently rejoined.  In any case, he appreciated the 
clarification that Ambassador Swing is the U.S. candidate and 
he expressed his conviction in Swing's qualifications for the 
office.
