RE: STATE 85097 
 
¶1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST. SEE PARAGRAPH 3. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In a conversation with Poloff on August 22, 
Christian-Marc Liflander, Director of Policy Planning 
Department at the Estonian MOD, Riho Rongelep, Director 
of Operations (MOD), Liis Jemmer from the Policy 
Planning Department (MOD) and Evelin Looman discussed 
the Government of Estonia (GOE) reaction to Secretary 
Gates proposal to create a Regional Command South 
Civilian-Military Planning and Coordination Cell 
(reftel).  Liflander commented that overall, the GOE 
agrees that it would be beneficial to have a coordinated 
body on the ground to analyze lessons learned.  At the 
same time, Liflander cautioned that any potential GOE 
contribution to the cell will be modest at best.  If 
possible, the GOE would be content with being 
represented  by Great Britain.  Looman (MFA) echoed this 
statement by pointing out that the GOE's limited 
resources are prioritized for the PRT in Lashkar Gah. 
While the GOE is constantly looking for ways to 
strengthen and deepen its contributions to southern 
Afghanistan, it would be difficult to find a person to 
contribute to the cell.  At the same time, the GOE is 
more than willing to cooperate with cell 
recommendations. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)   Among the few concerns voiced during the 
meeting was the lack of reference to the European Union 
Police Mission (EUPOL) in coordinating work with the 
cell.  The inclusion of EUPOL is a very important 
element for the GOE.  Liflander also questioned the 
proposed rotation cycle.  He suggested that the cycles 
would need to be long enough for leaders on the ground 
to observe conditions and make educated recommendations. 
Questions were also raised concerning the scope of the 
cell's ability to initiate recommendations. 
Specifically, how will identified shortfalls be dealt 
with?  Finally Riho Rongelep (MOD) asked whether or not 
the initiative for the RC-South cell is built upon the 
'extraordinary' U.S. and UN Assistance Mission in 
Afghanistan (UNAMA) work in RC-East? 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Post requests Department 
assistance in providing additional information in 
response to GOE inquiries concerning the proposed RC- 
South Civilian-Military Planning and Coordination Cell. 
END ACTION REQUEST.
