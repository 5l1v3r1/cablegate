quote 
 
Canada's links with the people of Cuba go back many years. 
Indeed, Cuba was the first Caribbean nation selected by 
Canada as a location for a Canadian diplomatic mission. 
 
Canada engages Cuban society through our diplomatic presence 
which is aimed at helping to lay the groundwork for a Cuba 
that upholds freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of 
law.  This is in keeping with our renewed engagement in the 
Americas. 
 
Canada continues to monitor developments in Cuba closely, and 
we are concerned about the plight of political prisoners, 
especially those suffering from poor health.  It is our hope 
that recent shifts will open the way for the Cuban people to 
pursue a process of political and economic reform.
