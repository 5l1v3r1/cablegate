SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE: AVIAN INFLUENZA FALSE ALARM 
 
 
¶1.  Several animals were found dead with symptoms similar to 
Avian flu in the north of Cote d'Ivoire the week of April 6; 
sixteen chickens, two ducks, and two dogs that apparently ate 
the carcasses of the dead poultry.  A World Health 
Organization (WHO) satellite office in Bouake, the northern 
capial, forwarded specimens from the dead animals to Abidjan 
for testing.  External symptoms and the manner of death fit 
the pattern of the H5N1 Avian flu strain, but both initial 
testing by the Pasteur Institute in Abidjan and secondary 
testing by the Pasteur Institute in Paris revealed that this 
was not the cause of death. Other tests were conducted to 
determine what the cause of death was, but so far the results 
are inconclusive. 
 
¶2.  While Cote d'Ivoire has not experienced any cases of H5N1 
Avian flu, it has been declared in neighboring Burkina Faso 
to the north. WHO and key Ivorian ministries are working on 
containment plans, and plan to call a "round table" to 
mobilize resources in Cote d'Ivoire to prepare for Avian flu 
or other possible epidemics.
