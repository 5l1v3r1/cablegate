His Excellency George W. Bush, President of the United States 
of America 
 
I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the 
courageous positions you have taken in supporting our brave 
Iraqi people in confronting the dictatorship of Saddam 
Hussein.  I would like to thank you also for your support to 
the democratic political process which was achieved by our 
people, hoping for your continued support and backing for 
democracy, for the continuation of building the political 
structure and the stabilization of security through the 
specialized technocrats for attaining the national goals away 
from sectarian and party allotments. 
 
Your historic responsibility before your nation, our people, 
and all of humanity calls on you to protect the fruits of 
democracy in our oppressed country.  In this way, you will be 
sending a civilized message to the world asserting that the 
will of the peoples must prevail and that their archenemy, 
terrorism, must be definitely routed. 
 
Your Excellency, kindly accept our sincere thanks and 
appreciation. 
 
Dr. Ibrahim Aleshaiker al-Ja'fari 
Ex-Prime Minister of Iraq 
Member of Parliament
