the wrong step to begin with.  Her meeting with Palestine and Israel 
did not have equal representation as one is a prime minister and the 
other a president.  Even though the US and Israel continue to 
recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization, the upcoming national 
consensus government of Palestine will again be ruled by Haniyeh of 
the Hamas organization.  Given that fact, Israel and the US are 
engaging in a dialogue with the symbolic leader of Palestine instead 
of the Prime Minister who has the power to control the executive 
mechanism.  The consensus initiative by Secretary Rice cannot bring 
any peace to the Middle East.  Even if these three agree among each 
other, no government in Palestine can implement it or explain it to 
the public.  In sum, the recent meeting between Rice, Olmert and 
Abbas is nothing but cosmetic." 
 
Writing in the economic-political daily Referans, Cengiz Candar 
comments: "The developments in northern Iraq and the situation 
related to the Iran-US tiff along with Turkey's domestic concerns 
will directly shape the future direction of Turkish-American 
relations.  All of this makes it even more important to know whether 
the Turkish Chief of General Staff talked about Iran with Vice 
President Cheney.  Given the current situation, a cross border 
operation by Turkey into Northern Iraq, if and when it happens, will 
inevitably lead to a new political equilibrium in Iraq.  The US 
normally would not normally give a green light to Turkey for this 
unless something tangible comes from Ankara.  This means in 
practical terms that Ankara would have to agree to be on board with 
Washington on the Iran issue and in return the US would give a green 
light for Turkey's incursion. Otherwise, the US would never 
sacrifice Kurds because of Turkey's concerns -- meaning a green 
light remains a dream.  In that respect one might wonder whether 
Turkey is capable of carrying out an operation despite the US.  When 
we look for the answer to this question we have to bear in mind the 
consequences we will face."
