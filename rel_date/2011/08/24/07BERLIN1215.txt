SUBJECT: GERMANY LIFTS ENTRY BAN ON REVEREND MOON 
 
 
¶1. (SBU)  According to Dr. Dieter Romann, Director of the 
German Interior Ministry's Office of Border Security Issues, 
the "hit" in the German consular and border control system 
calling for Reverend Sun Myung Moon's visa denial has been 
removed.  Dr. Romann issued a statement to Embassy Berlin, 
the translation of which follows: 
 
¶2. (SBU)  "After the ruling of the Rhineland-Palatinate 
Higher Administrative Court, the "hit" (which called for visa 
denial) under Article 96 Paragraph 2 of the SDU was deleted 
by the Federal Police Authority in Koblenz on June 4, 2007. 
Through this action, the obligation of other Schengen partner 
states to apply this hit has been lifted as well. 
Fundamentally, the granting of an entry visa is a 
discretionary decision.  Therefore, as with any other 
travelers, any actual application for entry submitted by Mr. 
and Mrs. Moon would be processed through the normal police 
border control procedures and a decision regarding entry 
would then be made." 
 
¶3. (U)  This action was taken in order to comply with a May 
2007 ruling by the Higher Administrative Court of Koblenz and 
an October 2006 ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court.
