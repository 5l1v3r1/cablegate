     ¶B. STATE 116776 
 
¶1. (SBU) Meeting with Department of International Relations 
and Cooperation (DIRCO) Deputy Director for Nuclear 
Disarmament and Nonproliferation Johann Kellerman on December 
22, DepPolCouns underscored the message US UNVIE Vienna 
reported Ref A on U.S.-South African partnership to secure 
further IAEA Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements. 
DepPolCouns presented Ref B non-paper and indicated that the 
document had been discussed in Vienna.  Kellerman did not 
comment on the proposed plan.  Echoing Ref A comment on South 
Africa's manpower shortage, Kellerman confirmed that Pretoria 
would not be able to give us an answer on the proposed 
collaboration until late January at the earliest. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kellerman said Ambassador Leslie Gumbi is assigned 
to replace Xolisa Mahbongo as DIRCO Chief Director for 
Multilateral Affairs as Mahbongo departs for Vienna. 
Kellerman commented that he looked forward to working for 
Gumbi again (Note: Kellerman worked for Gumbi at the South 
African Mission to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. 
End note), but he added that Gumbi is not expected in the 
office before the end of January.  Ambassador Minty is also 
on leave and not expected back until late January.  Kellerman 
himself is due back in the office on January 18.
