SUBJECT: MOP-3 CARTAGENA PROTOCOL YEMEN ACTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 70210 
 
(SBU) Post contacted the Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG) 
Standardization Organization regarding any action taken by 
the ROYG in response to the MOP-3 of the Cartagena Protocol. 
Deputy Minister Ahmed Al-Besha stated that the ROYG did 
participate in the Cartagena Protocol, but did not 
participate in the Curitiba / Brazil meeting.  The ROYG is in 
the process of preparing a list of products that may contain 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
LMOs.  Once the list is completed they will issue a decision 
which will be similar to whatever is applied by the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC).  Al-Besha explained that the ROYG 
expects to announce within one month that the ROYG 
Standardization Organization will join the GCC Standards 
Council.  This will require that they follow the GCC's 
Standards Regulations.
