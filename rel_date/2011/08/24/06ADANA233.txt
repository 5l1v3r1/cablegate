POLITICAL 
 
OZGUR GUNDEM:   The subgovernor of Mardin's Dargecit district, 
who rejected the names proposed for streets and parks by the 
municipality assembly two times on grounds that the names were

the same proposed names. 
 
¶3.      OZGUR GUNDEM:   The daily reports that the documents the 
villagers found in the JITEM members' car as they stopped and 
searched the car in Sirnak's Uludere district over the weekend 
allegedly contained names of Kurds living in the southeastern 
region, information about those villagers, license plate 
numbers, etc.  (see press summary for October 31) 
 
¶4.      OZGUR GUNDEM:   Thousands of people attended the funeral 
in Batman of three PKK terrorists killed in a section of 
Batman's Hasankeyf district on October 22 during a military 
operation.

issue a call for laying down of arms in the coming week.

¶6.      CUMHURIYET:     Security forces seized one hand grenade, a 
pistol and bullets found in a car they suspected and followed in

CRIME / LAW ENFORCEMENT 
 
¶7.      ZAMAN / BOLGE / OZGUR GUNDEM:   Adana's Second Court of 
First Instance continued to try Ceyhan's Mayor Huseyin Sozlu 
(from MHP) and two journalists on grounds that they insulted PM 
Erdogan during an interview given to a local Adana newspaper on 
December 2005. 
 
CULTURE / SOCIETY 
 
¶8.      HURRIYET / SABAH (GUNEY) / OZGUR GUNDEM / EVRENSEL:  Heavy 
rains affecting the southeastern region caused infrastructure to 
collapse in Gaziantep, Diyarbakir, Mersin and Hakkari provinces. 
 Flooding washed out houses and businesses in the city centers. 
The streets were covered with mud in Sirnak's Cizre district, 
and a section of a road in between Semdinli and Yuksekova 
districts in Hakkari collapsed.  A small passenger bus traveling 
between Diyarbakir and Mardin were caught in flood waters and 14 
people died.  Three people died in Diyarbakir's Cinar district 
and four people died in Sirnak's Silopi and Uludere districts. 
The death toll because of the flooding reached 21.  Rains also 
badly affected the cotton cultivated in the fields decreasing 
the quality of the cotton produced in the Cukurova region.
