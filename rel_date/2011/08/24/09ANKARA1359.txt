SUBJECT: TURKEY: PM ERDOGAN WILL ATTEND FRIENDS OF 
DEMOCRATIC PAKISTAN SUMMIT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 96052 
 
(U)  On September 16 we delivered REFTEL points to Turkish 
MFA Division Head Emre Karagol.  Karagol confirmed that 
Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan will attend the September 24 
Friends of Democratic Pakistan Summit as part of his trip to 
New York for the UN General Assembly.  He said that PM 
Erdogan would indeed like the opportunity to speak at the 
Summit.  The rest of the Turkish delegation (the "plus four") 
has not yet been determined, Karagol said, but he promised to 
pass along those details as soon as they become available.
