IN TODAY'S PAPERS 
 
Armenia, Azerbaijan Seek Solution to Conflict 
Media outlets give extensive coverage to the meeting of the 
presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the US Embassy in Prague, 
accompanied by the co-chairmen of the Minsk Group, to seek solutions 
to the territorial conflict between their countries.  Mainstream 
Sabah headlines "Peace Winds in Caucasus," and reports that, 
"President Aliyev and President Sargsyan reached an agreement on the 
principles of the resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. A 
timetable and roadmap are being developed for a settlement." 
Mainstream Haberturk reports, "the compromise reached by the two 
leaders was "historic," adding, "two leaders have passed a critical 
threshold in Prague."  Mainstream Hurriyet reports 
"US-Russia-France: Agreement ok" and says "the US, Russia and France 
said in a joint statement that the meeting of the two presidents was 
"constructive," and added the two parties reached an agreement about 
the methods for working out a settlement."   Mainstream Sabah quotes 
Matt Bryza, Deputy Secretary of State for European and Eurasian 
Affairs as saying "for the first time, there's been a lot of 
improvement and we expect concrete results for a settlement by the 
end of the year."  Mainstream Milliyet adds, "the next meeting will 
be in June with the Minsk Group chairmen and the Foreign Ministers 
of Azerbaijan and Armenia.  Liberal Radikal reports "the deal in 
Prague has been the first step towards a settlement since 1993," and 
the paper quotes President Abdullah Gul speaking to journalists en 
route to Prague saying, "2009 offers an opportunity for solving 
problems in the Caucasus and this opportunity shouldn't be missed." 
 
Comment on Prague Talks 
 
Murat Yetkin wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal: "As President 
Gul mentioned after the talks in Prague, there is significant hope 
for the future and 2009 should be considered the year of opportunity 
for peace in the Caucasus.  The fact that a meeting between Azeri 
and Armenian leaders was held in the U.S. Embassy in Prague clearly 
indicates the strong U.S. commitment to the problem-solving 
process." 
 
President Gul Meets with DTP Leader Ahmet Turk 
Mainstream Sabah and Islamist-oriented Zaman report in a series of 
meetings held with opposition leaders, that President Gul received 
DTP leader Ahmet Turk yesterday.  Reportedly during the meeting, Gul 
warned Turk to remain distant to the PKK and asked the DTP to work 
on the problems of the whole country, not just of one region. 
 
Editorial Opinions on PKK and Kurdish Problem 
 
Ertugrul Ozkok wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "The Milliyet interview 
with PKK's Karayilan should be taken seriously by state authorities. 
 The leader of the organization is now talking about some concrete 
steps toward disarming the PKK.  Public opinion is more mature than 
before.  Frankly speaking, I'd like to be a messenger on behalf of 
the imprisoned leader Ocalan by interviewing him because what he 
says on this is very important." 
 
Cengiz Candar wrote in liberal-intellectual Radikal: "There is an 
ongoing silence in official circles about the PKK leadership's call 
for reconciliation and ceasefire.  It may be hard to say, but we 
have to face the fact that the PKK is an integral part of the 
Kurdish problem and cannot be left aside.  Ankara should move and 
take proactive steps toward finding the right way to address the 
Kurdish problem by considering all aspects of it." 
 
Yasemin Congar wrote in leftist Taraf: "The recent statements from 
the PKK's Karayilan should not be ignored.  He is showing some clear 
direction on how to win over the PKK militants and get them to 
return home.  This is a process which can start the actual disarming 
of the PKK.  One of the demands of Karayilan is an amnesty for 
imprisoned militants as well as the leader Ocalan.  It may sound 
 
ANKARA 00000672  002 OF 002 
 
 
far-fetched to free Ocalan at this point, but at least the state 
should consider steps for the 4,000 militants in prisons thru a 
liberal interpretation of Article 221 of the Penal Code, known as 
the Repentance Law." 
 
Constitutional Court Vice Chairman Osman Paksut was Monitored 
Coincidentally 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports that Constitutional Court 
Vice-Chair Osman Paksut claimed he was the victim of wire tapping in 
the Ergenekon investigation and has filed a criminal complaint 
against the Ergenekon prosecutors.  The prosecutors, on the other 
hand, claimed that Paksut made phone calls with a commercial line 
belonging to his wife, and his calls were monitored coincidentally. 
They adding that certain issues overheard in the wiretapping 
constitute crimes. 
 
Village Guard System Might be Abolished 
Hurriyet, Zaman, Milliyet, Radikal, Aksam, Vatan:  In the aftermath 
of the shooting of 44 people at a wedding ceremony in Bilge village 
of southeastern province Mardin, the incident remains the top issue 
on the domestic agenda.  Mainstream Hurriyet reports that the number 
of detainees linked to the massacre increased to 11.   The 
gendarmerie collected all weapons of the village guards in the 
village.  Interior Minister Besir Atalay said these weapons were 
sent for ballistic examination.  Tabloid Aksam notes that the 
massacre in Mardin triggered heated debates about the village guard 
system.  Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Cicek said "the system might be 
revised or abolished.  Mainstream Milliyet quotes President Gul 
saying "The incident in Mardin is the result of ignorance, not the 
village guard system.  The village guard system is a comprehensive 
issue which should be discussed by experts and state institutions. 
The system cannot be evaluated based on only one incident.  This 
system has a security angle and should be evaluated carefully and 
then the appropriate action should be taken."
