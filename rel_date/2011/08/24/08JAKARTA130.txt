¶1. (U) Per reftels, Post conveyed the draft agenda and logistical 
information for the Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and 
Climate Change (MEMII), to the Government of Indonesia (GOI) on 
January 18.  Post delivered copies to all Indonesian ministries and 
agencies represented at the first MEM in Washington, D.C. (ref D). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The GOI has not yet finalized the composition of its 
delegation.  The Ministry of Environment (MOE), however, will lead 
the Indonesian delegation and has already selected which of its 
officials will attend MEMII.  There will be an inter-ministerial 
meeting on January 24 to both finalize the delegation and discuss 
MEMII agenda items.  The MOE officials are: 
 
-- Ms. Masnellyarti Hilman, Deputy Minister 
-- Ms. Amanda Katili, Special Assistant to the Minister and Chair of 
the COP13 President's Secretariat 
-- Ms. Murni Titi Resdiana, Head of Ministerial Secretariat and 
Member of the COP13 President's Secretariat. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Ms. Katili, and subsequently confirmed by 
Salman Al-Farisi, Director for Development, Economic and 
Environmental Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Deplu), it 
is highly likely that Deputy Minister Hilman will be the Head of 
Delegation.  Director Al-Farisi indicated that his Deputy, Ms. Dewi 
Savitri Wahab, would represent Deplu on the delegation.  Al-Farisi 
also said that there would likely be a Ministry of Energy and 
Natural Resources representative. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post will follow up and report on GOI comments and 
reactions to the draft MEMII agenda, and on the outcomes of the 
inter-ministerial meeting on January 24.
