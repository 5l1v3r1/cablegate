ASSESS SITUATION BEFORE COMMITTING TROOPS 
 
REF: STATE 51828 
 
¶1. (SBU) On May 7, Charge d'Affaires delivered reftel 
demarche to Foreign Secretary Riaz Khan, urging Pakistan to 
make a public commitment of troops and police for the future 
UN/AU hybrid operation.  In response, Khan referred to 
Pakistan's clear, longstanding policy regarding its 
peacekeeping operations -- it will only commit forces if 
there is consensus in the destination country to receive the 
deployment. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Khan mentioned the example of Sierra Leone, where 
Pakistan first sent an advance mission to assess the 
situation on the ground.  This mission consulted with both 
the government and opposition before deciding that an 
agreement between the two was tenable.  Only then did 
Pakistan commit several thousand peacekeeping troops to 
Sierra Leone.  Khan said that Pakistan would first have to 
send a mission to Darfur before committing to participate in 
a peacekeeping operation there.
