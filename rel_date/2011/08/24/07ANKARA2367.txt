REF: ANKARA 2313 and previous 
 
(U) Sensitive but unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) This is another in a series of periodic reports on PKK 
violence in Turkey.  Our primary sources for these reports are 
mainstream Turkish press services, such as the Anatolian News 
Agency, and international wire services.  While these are more 
reliable than most Turkish press sources, they are not necessarily 
unimpeachable.  A major source is the Turkish General Staff (TGS) 
website which documents contacts/clashes with the PKK.  Press 
services sympathetic to the PKK, such as Neu-Isenburg People's 
Defense Forces and Firat News Agency, tend to report higher numbers 
of the Turkish Security Forces casualties and are often otherwise 
unreliable. 
 
¶2. (U) During the September 8-15, 2007 reporting period, no GOT 
security officials were killed but 12 were injured, including two 
village guards in clashes with PKK terrorists and ten security 
officials in mine/IED explosions. 
 
¶3. (U) In the same period, at least six PKK terrorists were killed 
in clashes, with the body of another located near the site of a 
clash whose death could have been inflicted either by Turkish 
security forces or by PKK forces (who have been known to execute 
those trying to surrender or flee).  Another four PKKers were 
captured and three surrendered. 
 
¶4. (U) The TGS website reported five clashes between security forces 
and PKK terrorists in Turkey's southeastern region during the 
reporting period.  Security forces discovered at least 13 PKK 
shelters/caves/caches and seized booby-trapped land mines; other 
explosives, including A-4 and TNT; Kalashnikov rifles; cartridges; 
hand grenades; pistols; night vision binoculars; TV sets; satellite 
antennas; and radios. 
 
¶5. Throughout the week security forces spotted around a dozen PKK 
improvised explosive devices in the region and most of them were 
detonated before they went off. 
 
¶6. (U) Activity as reported by TGS website:
