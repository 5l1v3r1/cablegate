¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  In response to offers by donor countries to 
contribute to the newly-formed JIU and JIPU in Abyei, UNMIS has 
proposed a partnership package, including a donor trust fund, to 
facilitate donations.  However, lack of will and both UN and 
Sudanese bureaucracy threaten to prevent the rapid acquisition of 
equipment vital to the new units' mission.  END SUMMARY. 
 
New Joint Security Units for Abyei 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The June 8 Abyei Roadmap agreement provides for the 
deployment of a reconstituted Joint Integrated Unit (JIU) battalion 
as well as a joint police unit (JIPU), both made up of personnel 
drawn from the north and south Sudan.  The previous Abyei JIU 
battalion disintegrated during the outbreak of fighting in May.  The 
JIPU also arrived last month and is still in the process of 
deploying.  The JIPU will be unique to Abyei.  Personnel for the new 
JIU arrived in Abyei approximately one month ago.  The new JIU lacks 
any equipment or supplies and is currently dependent on UNMIS 
support for accommodation, water, and some rations. UNMIS has been 
providing accommodation (in the form of tents) and rudimentary 
training (hygiene, camp routine, basic military tactics, and rule of 
law). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) According to the UK DATT, who visited Abyei August 20, the 
JIU is now fully manned, but lacks the equipment required to perform 
its security mission. He said the JIPU is in the process of being 
staffed and trained.  Despite early concerns that the two units 
might overlap in their missions and create confusion, he reported 
that the JIU and the JIPU are cooperating well and have worked out a 
division of responsibilities.  However, the JIPU suffers from a 
divided chain of command, having to report to both the GNU in 
Khartoum and GoSS in Juba. 
 
UNMIS Seeks to Facilitate Bilateral Donations 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Although according to the CPA the GNU is responsible for 
funding the JIUs, to date it only has provided about 40% of the 
JIUs' total budgetary requirements, enough for salaries, but leaving 
the existing JIUs lacking in basic infrastructure and equipment to 
carry out their intended mission.  Several donor countries (e.g., 
UK, the Netherlands, Egypt) expressed interest in providing 
bilateral support to activate the new Abyei security units.  In 
response to these offers, UNMIS has circulated a proposal to donor 
country-embassies for a partnership to support the reconstituted JIU 
battalion in Abyei.  (Note: UNMIS proposal has been transmitted 
electronically to AF/SPG. End note.)  Simultaneously, UNMIS has 
circulated a proposal for a separate JIPU Rapid Deployment Package. 
 
Abyei JIU Immediate Needs Package 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5.  (SBU) UNMIS is proposing a partnership among the JIU, UNMIS, and 
donor countries to provide the Abyei battalion with a package of 
training, materiel, and specialist support to make the unit 
operational.  Support would take the form of accommodations and 
infrastructure, communications, and transport.  UNMIS estimates the 
approximate total cost of the package at US$4.01 million. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The proposed UNMIS partnership envisions Sudan's JIU and 
UNMIS acting as a clearing house for proposals and funds and 
providing advice and assistance to the Abyei battalion.  UNMIS 
already is providing limited direct support to the Abyei JIU as 
described above.  UNMIS is soliciting donor country contributions to 
fund the remaining requirements.  The UK reportedly has made 
available funds for quick impact procurement of equipment outside of 
the proposed trust fund.  Once the Abyei JIU becomes operational, 
the battalion's on-going costs would be funded by the GNU, in 
accordance with the CPA. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) UNMIS estimates of specific JIU requirements and 
associated costs are: 
 
Command, control and information systems   $192,954 
Electricity supply        $224,023 
Transport          $852,020 
Engineering equipment     $1,530,653 
Accommodation           $1,208,987 
 
JIPU Rapid Deployment Package

¶8.  (SBU) UNMIS has proposed a similar assistance package to provide 
support needed to activate the Abyei JIPU.  UNMIS proposes that it

provide the JIPU with the same support it is providing the JIU.  In 
addition, it will rebuild two damaged police stations in Abyei for 
the use of the JIPU.  It is seeking donor support for additional 
requirements, totaling an estimated US$853,332.  Some donors who are 
prohibited by law from providing military assistance, (e.g., Germany 
and Norway) may be willing to donate to JIPU support. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) UNMIS breaks down JIPU requirements and associated costs 
as: 
 
Basic orientation program      $93,790 
Workshop on post-conflict trauma    $10,170 
Workshop on conflict resolution    $10,170 
Office equipment       $44,082 
Uniforms & personal equipment    $367,476 
Communication equipment     $122,097 
Transport        $205,547 
 
UN/Sudanese Bureaucracy Hinder Procurement

¶10.  (SBU) According to the UNMIS POC for JIU issues, purchases for 
the JIU from the Trust Fund will be made through the UN procurement 
system.  The UNMIS POC complained that the UN system is complicated 
and slow.  As a result, he anticipates that procurement of equipment 
urgently needed for the JIU to perform its mission will take months. 
 
 
¶11.  (SBU) The UK reportedly has made available bilateral funds 
outside of the Trust Fund for quick-impact purchases.  However, our 
UNMIS contact said that when it sought to use some of this money to 
import commercial radios for JIU communications, it had difficulty 
obtaining the required end-user certificates from the GNU, although 
the JIU is a Sudanese government entity.  He expressed frustration 
at the apparent lack of urgency on the part of Sudanese authorities. 
 Another concern is the receptivity of the Joint Defense Board (JDB 
-- the JIUs' command) to outside assistance.  On at least one 
occasion, the JDB blocked a package of assistance to the JIUs from 
Norway. 
 
Comment 
- - - - 
 
¶12.  (SBU) UNMIS' positive initiative represents an effort to 
facilitate assistance from donor states that would like to support 
implementation of the Abyei roadmap by assisting the two joint 
security units there.  This effort deserves our support despite 
limited USG ability to provide material assistance to the JIU and 
JIPU due to US legal restrictions.  UNMIS' efforts are at risk of 
being thwarted by a combination of UN bureaucracy and lack of 
urgency on the part of Sudanese authorities.  Post plans to raise 
the issue of JIU and JIPU support with Sudanese authorities, and we 
suggest that this should also be part of any future bilateral 
discussions headed by the Special Envoy.
