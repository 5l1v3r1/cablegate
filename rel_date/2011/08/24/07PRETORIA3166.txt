Business Confidence Down 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Rattled by global market volatility, the South African 
Chamber of Business (SACOB) Business Confidence Index fell from 99.6 
points in July to 98.1 points in August, an 11-month low.  SACOB 
said last month's turmoil, which prompted a sell-off in emerging 
market assets, could hold "major risks" for the South African 
economy, particularly if there were a lasting slowdown in capital 
inflows.  SACOB was referring to fears that an anticipated slowdown 
in global growth may hit South African exports while further risk 
aversion could stem the portfolio investments that have so far 
financed the large deficit on the current account.  South Africa's 
current account deficit is one of the largest among major emerging 
markets, reaching 6.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) last year, 
its biggest ratio in more than 25 years.  With exports rising slowly 
and imports soaring in response to an official investment spending 
drive, analysts expect the deficit to remain above 5% over the next 
few years, posing a threat to the rand if capital inflows subside.

Vehicle Sales Down 
------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) South African vehicle sales decreased by 3% from 59,805 units 
in August 2006 to 58,040 units in August 2007, the fifth consecutive 
decline in vehicle sales as higher interest rates dampened consumer 
demand.  Figures released by the National Association of Automobile 
Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) indicated that passenger car 
sales decreased by 3.8% y/y in August and that this trend is 
expected to continue for the rest of the 2007.  Sales of commercial 
vehicles also contracted for the first time this year, falling 1.4% 
y/y.  McCarthy Motor Holdings Chairman Brand Pretorius attributed 
the decline in the commercial vehicle segment to the general 
slowdown in macroeconomic growth and said it was a cause of concern. 
 Over the past four years, both the medium and heavy commercial 
vehicle segments have regularly showed double-digit growth of close 
to 20%.  The growth rate of medium commercial vehicles slowed to 
6.1% in August while heavy commercial vehicles sales growth dropped 
to 8% y/y.  Economists said the economic impact of the South African 
Reserve Bank's monetary policy is becoming visible in declining 
vehicle sales, slower credit extension and lower retail sales.

Economic Freedom Ranking Down 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) According to the Free Market Foundation, South Africa has 
improved its economic freedom rating from 6.7 to 6.8 (out of 10). 
However, it has also moved down six places in the world rankings 
from 54th to 60th out of the 141 countries measured, to share this 
ranking with Lesotho, Thailand, Kyrgyzstan, Montenegro, Malaysia, 
and Trinidad and Tobago.  The report explains that South Africa is 
sliding down the rankings because it is virtually standing still 
while being overtaken by countries that are steadily increasing 
their levels of economic freedom.  It notes that South Africa could 
improve its economic freedom by addressing problematic areas that 
include: government expenditure and investment, tax rates, crime, 
international capital market controls, minimum wage and labor 
regulations, centralised collective bargaining, and bureaucracy 
costs.  (Economic Freedom of the World: 2007 Annual Report)

Telkom To Drop Call Center Prices 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) met one of its 
first goals for its new industrial policy framework by securing 
Telkom's agreement to discount its telecommunications prices for 
business process outsourcing (BPO) operations.  According to DTI 
Deputy Director-General Lionel October, Telkom was instructed to 
drop its prices to bring telecommunications costs in line with other 
competitive countries.  High telecommunications costs have been a 
constraint to attracting foreign companies specializing in call 
centers.  With the lower costs, one U.S. and two European firms have 
already decided to invest in call centers and expect to hire several 
thousand employees.  South Africa has already had some success with 
call centers.  The subsector has grown 8% per year over the last 
four years and currently employs 54,000 call center agents.

Angloplat Unveils BEE Deals 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Anglo Platinum (Angloplat) unveiled three Black Economic 
Empowerment (BEE) deals to put almost $5 billion of its assets under 
the direct control of black South Africans and introduce new players 
to South Africa's dynamic platinum sector.  The deals will boost 
Angloplat's BEE credentials, which has been prodded by the 
government to move faster to bring black players on board.  New 
legislation introduced in 2004 requires South African mining 
companies to convert their old licenses to "new order" licenses and 
reach 15% black ownership by 2009 and 26% by 2014.  It was not 
immediately clear if the new deal would resolve license conversions. 
 The new transaction involves transfer of Angloplat's interests in 
the Lebowa Platinum Mine (on the northeast corner of the Bushveld 
complex) and the Boysendale Mine to Anooraq and Mvela Resources, as 
well as the introduction of a new employee share ownership plan.

Egypt's OCI Invests In New Cement Plant 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7 (U) Egypt-based Orascom Construction Industries (OCI) announced 
that it would invest $440 million in a new cement plant in South 
Africa's Northwest Province.  The plant targets an annual capacity 
of two million tons in 2010.  The investment comes as local 
producers have had to import cement to meet rising demand.

Downsizing Measures Underway At SAA 
----------------------------------- 
 
8 (U) South African Airlines hopes to save R638 million ($89 
million) by cutting jobs and renegotiating the contracts of its 
10,000 employees.  Trade unions project that at least 3,000 jobs 
could be affected by the downsizing.  SAA plans to make a final 
decision after a series of consultations and predicts that 223 
senior managers will lose their jobs saving the company R110 million 
($15.3 million).  SAA plans to offer severance packages to the 
affected employees out of the R4 billion ($550 million) it has 
requested from the government of which R1.4 billion ($200 million) 
was received in April.  SAA hopes these cost-cutting measures will 
help the airline return to profitability within the next 18 months. 
SAA has been plagued by rising fuel, aircraft leasing, and salary 
costs.  It also suffers from a bloated and complex management 
structure, and the restructuring is expected to streamline decision 
making and eliminate redundancies.  SAA also plans to reduce perks 
such as travel benefits and fresh flowers at its check in counters.

ArcelorMittal Gets $100 Million Fine 
------------------------------------ 
 
9 (U) South Africa's Competition Tribunal imposed a huge $100 
million fine on ArcelorMittal South Africa (formerly Mittal Steel 
SA, formerly Iscor Steel) for abusing its dominance and charging 
 
PRETORIA 00003166  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
excessive prices for flat steel.  The penalty is the largest imposed 
by the Tribunal in its nine-year history and represents 5.5% of 
Mittal's $1.8 billion flat steel sales in the 2003 financial year. 
The Tribunal is entitled to impose a penalty of up to 10% of a 
firm's annual turnover for contravening the Competition Act.  The 
Tribunal also ordered Mittal to stop imposing conditions on the 
resale of flat steel products bought from it.  The fine and the 
prohibition order follow the tribunal's March ruling that Mittal had 
contravened the Competition Act.  That ruling responds to complaints 
lodged by Harmony Gold (and others) in 2004 alleging that Mittal has 
abused its market position.  Tribunal Chairman David Lewis said in 
the strongly worded statement that the excessive prices charged by 
Mittal had caused "considerable damage to customers of the affected 
products and to the structure and fabric of the economy".  Lewis 
warned Mittal that if it attempted to side-step the prohibition and 
use alternative mechanisms to maintain excessive prices, "then the 
prospect of more invasive remedies will loom large and may even 
include the enforced divestiture of its steel producing plant".  The 
ruling opens the way for Harmony to institute civil action against 
Mittal, which was ordered to pay the costs of the complainants. 
Mittal expressed disappointment at the ruling and said that it would 
consider the judgment with its advisers.  (Business Report,
