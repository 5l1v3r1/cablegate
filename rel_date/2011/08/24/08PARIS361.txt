CONTACT GROUP 
 
REF: STATE 16168 
 
(SBU)  FRANCE IS OPEN TO REFORMING THE SOMALIA INTERNATIONAL 
CONTACT GROUP AS PROPOSED IN REFTEL DEMARCHE, MFA SOMALIA 
DESK OFFICER THIERRY CABOCHE SAID ON FEBRUARY 29.  HE 
COMMENTED THAT THE DEMARCHE MADE MANY GOOD POINTS, ESPECIALLY 
THE NOTION OF INDIVIDUAL CLUSTER GROUPS.  MAKING A VEILED BUT 
MILDLY-STATED REFERENCE TO FRANCE'S SLIGHT IRRITATION AT NOT 
BEING OFFERED FULL MEMBERSHIP IN THE INTERNATIONAL CONTACT 
GROUP WHEN IT WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED (NOTWITHSTANDING FRENCH 
REGIONAL INTERESTS SUCH AS DJIBOUTI), CABOCHE ADDED THAT 
"PERHAPS THE GROUP'S FORMAL MEMBERSHIP COULD BE ENLARGED." 
HE SAID THAT THE GOF LOOKED FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSION OF 
THE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES AS U.S. IDEAS TAKE FURTHER SHAPE.
