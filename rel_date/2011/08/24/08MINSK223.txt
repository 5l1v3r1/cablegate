¶2.  Protestant Pastor Charged 
 
The Minsk city prosecutor's office issued administrative charges to 
New Life Church (NLC) Pastor Vyacheslav Goncharenko March 24 for 
organizing a signature campaign to petition amendments to the 2002 
religion law.  Prosecutor Yuriy Karpitskiy informed Goncharenko that 
the campaign violated regulations concerning individuals' ability to 
initiate changes and amendments to enacted legislation.  On March 
21, similar charges were brought against NLC lawyer Sergey Lukanin. 
In addition, Goncharenko is facing a fine of up to BYR 700,000 (USD 
325) for denying utility inspectors access to the NLC building. 
 
¶3.  Gomel Opposition Youth Sentenced to Jail 
 
A Gomel district court sentenced opposition youth activist Andrey 
Tenyuta to 10 days in jail March 21 for violating the public order. 
Police detained Tenyuta the previous day when a stranger attempted 
to attack him.  The activist maintained the assailant was "most 
likely a freelance BKGB agent" ordered to provoke him in order 
isolate him ahead of the March 25 Belarusian People's Republic 90th 
Anniversary demonstration. 
 
¶4.  Residents Protest Chemical Plant Construction 
 
Residents of the southeastern town of Druzhniy rallied March 22 to 
protest the scheduled construction of a chemical manufacturing and 
fertilizer recycling plant near the town.  Civil society activist 
Nikolay Pokhabov noted that over 500 people came out to demonstrate 
and "say no to poisonous chemicals."  Police officers observed the 
rally but did not intervene.  The demonstrators announced plans to 
initiate a local referendum and erected a cross at the construction 
site.  They earlier submitted a petition to Aleksandr Lukashenko 
signed by 1,000 residents calling for a halt to construction and 
expressing concerns about potential health risks. 
 
¶5.  GOB to Send Military Specialists to Venezuela 
 
Deputy Chief of the Belarusian Armed Forces General Staff Pyotr 
Tikhonovskiy announced at a March 25 press conference that 
Belarusian military advisors and experts will visit Venezuela to 
assist Caracas in improving its air defense and electronic warfare 
system.  The visit is part of a bilateral agreement Aleksandr 
Lukashenko signed during his official visit to Venezuela in December 
¶2007.  Tikhonovskiy noted about a dozen military specialists will 
visit in 2008, with larger groups to follow.

plans to meet with the CEO of Korea's LG Group to discuss a new 
liquid crystal display assembly project in Belarus.   Also during

¶10.  Quote of the Week 
---------------------- 
 
Valentin Sukalo, Chariman of the Supreme Court, apparently ignoring 
his own suggestions: 
 
"Our system of punishment should not only be based on law, but 
should be supported by the people.  Considering that 88 percent of 
crimes are non-violent, imprisonment should be applied sparingly."
