Main Stories: 
------------- 
U.S. Special Envoy Mitchell's meetings with Israeli officials on 
June 9 lead coverage in all dailies.  All headlines focus on 
Mitchell's statements about U.S. commitment to solving the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict by creating an environment conducive to 
peace talks between the two parties.  During his meeting with 
Israeli President Peres, Mitchell noted that the U.S. is deeply 
engaged in efforts to start immediate peace talks between Israel and 
the Palestinians, according to coverage.  Reporting also notes that 
Mitchell reiterated President Obama's support for the two-state 
solution to ensure peace and security in the region.  Mitchell also 
stressed that U.S. -Israeli relations are "unshakable" despite 
differences of opinion and also stressed the importance of the two 
parties meeting their Roadmap obligations in order to achieve a 
regional, comprehensive peace with a Palestinian state living side 
by side with Israel in peace and security.  For his part, President 
Peres outlined four key points to be considered in any peace 
agreement:  the two-state solution based on the Roadmap, the 
security of Israel, independence for the Palestinians, and reaching 
a comprehensive, regional peace between Israel and Arab countries. 
 
All front pages highlight Hamas leader Khalid Misha'al's statements 
during a June 9 press conference in Cairo, held after his meetings 
with Arab League Secretary General Musa.  Misha'al told press that 
Hamas does not object to having contact with the American 
administration and praised Obama's June 4 speech saying, "We are now 
hearing a new language and a new attitude and we hope to see this 
reflected in facts on the ground."  Misha'al added that Hamas will 
not be an obstacle to any "real" regional peace agreement that 
respects Palestinian rights to an independent state.  Misha'al also 
stressed, in reaction to recent clashes between Palestinian 
Authority security and Hamas militants in the West Bank town of 
Qalquiliya, that resistance to an occupying power should not be 
considered a crime.  In response to a question about the U.S.-backed 
two-state solution, Misha'al replied that Hamas, "will cooperate 
with Arab, regional and international efforts as long as they serve 
Palestinian interests." 
 
Al-Quds front pages news about Israeli Kadima party leader Tzipi 
Livni stating on June 9 that the two-state solution serves Israeli 
interests and calling on Israeli "right-wing" parties to revisit 
their policies.  Livni also warned Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu 
of the repercussions of rejecting the two-state solution, including 
the isolation of Israel in the region and the deterioration of 
relations with the U.S. 
 
Al Quds' front page cites Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth in 
reporting that West Bank settlements increased "dramatically" under 
former Israeli Prime Minister Olmert's tenure.  All dailies carry 
the story that estimates that the number of settlers increased from 
250,000 to 300,000 during that period.  According to Israeli 
sources, the construction and expansion of settlements is continuing 
at an "unprecedented speed," despite U.S. calls to halt settlement 
activities. 
 
Al-Quds' front page cites Wafa in reporting that, "on the first day 
of Envoy Mitchell's visit," Israeli authorities demolished two homes 
in the Old City of Jerusalem because the buildings lacked 
construction permits.  All papers carry the story and add that the 
Israeli authorities have postponed demolition orders for three other 
homes in the Jabal Al-Mukabbir area of East Jerusalem.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Hani Habib opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title, 
"The era of strategic speeches" (06/10):  "What will the global 
significance of Netanyahu's speech be?"  Although we suspect it is 
difficult for Netanyahu to quickly agree to U.S. orders and 
directions as presented in Obama's [Cairo] speech, we do expect that 
Netanyahu will eventually move closer and closer to the American 
vision...  He may publically endorse the Roadmap based on the 
two-state solution and a halt to settlement activities, but such a 
position will not be backed by the Israeli government, so what 
happens next?" 
 
2) Naji Shurrab opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the title, 
"U.S.-Israeli relations" (06/10):  "...the U.S. still considers 
Israel to be a strategic partner in the region and is still 
committed to Israel's stability and security... However, it would be 
wrong to assume that what serves Israeli interests will necessarily 
also serve American interests... a distinction that should be 
remembered when trying to reach a regional [peace] settlement."
