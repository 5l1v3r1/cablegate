¶1.  (SBU)  In a September 27 meeting with Charge, 
Ambassador Tedo Japaridze was delighted that Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation (BSEC) "senior officials" had agreed 
to U.S. observer status in the organization.  This would 
make his job of making BSEC a more effective 
organization.  He said the decision would be formalized 
at the upcoming BSEC Ministerial in Chisinau October 25- 
¶26. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Japaridze said it would send a useful signal 
if the United States, perhaps represented by the U.S. 
Mission in Chisinau, could participate in the 
Ministerial.  For the longer term, Japaridze saw 
potential for a U.S. role in BSEC's energy, 
transportation, and "soft security" agendas and urged us 
to work with the incoming BSEC chair, Romania, to find 
areas for fruitful interaction.
