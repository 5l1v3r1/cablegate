FRAUDULENT BIRTH REGISTRATIONS

¶1. (SBU) Summary:  This cable highlights the effective fraud tools 
and techniques that have uncovered the network of fraudulent birth 
registrations reported in refs (A) and (B). The Fraud Prevention 
Manager (FPM) and A/RSO-I continue to use a wide variety of fraud 
resources to not only identify additional cases, but develop the 
information already found. Quick action by Egyptian State Security 
Investigative Services (SSIS) on the information provided by the 
Fraud Prevention Unit (FPU) has greatly facilitated the rapid 
dismantling of this network.  Currently, SSIS has arrested and 
charged ten individuals (including two Amcits) and is seeking the 
arrest of three more, of whom none are American citizens. The FPU 
has identified the locations of two additional babies and confirmed 
a case of child trafficking using nonimmigrant visas. End Summary. 
 
 
The Recap 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) To date the FPU has identified 21 cases during the past 20 
years from the American Citizen Services Unit (ACS) where couples 
attempted to falsely document a newborn as an American citizen. Of 
those 21 cases, four couples were successful in getting their 
respective newborns to the United States and then subsequently 
documented as American citizens. In most cases, the newborns 
traveled with Egyptian passports. In addition, the FPU has 
identified one case from the nonimmigrant visa (NIV) unit where a 
doctor successfully smuggled a newborn to the United States on a 
non-immigrant visa. SSIS has arrested and charged two doctors, one 
nun, one banker and six alleged parents, two of whom are Amcits. All 
are being held awaiting trial.  SSIS has closed three 
clinics/hospitals, issued warrants for the arrest of another two 
doctors and one individual and located five newborns in Cairo that 
had been bought and sold.  SSIS has indicated that the newborns have 
been returned to Social Services. 
 
 
The Tools 
----------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The FPM and A/RSO-I have utilized all available fraud 
resources and outside contacts to uncover the complexity of the 
network and identify links. Arrival and departure information for 
the child traffickers from the Egyptian Civil Affairs Authority 
(CAA) helped pinpoint dates of travel. Crosschecking that 
information with the flight manifests available in the Arrival and 
Departure Information System (ADIS) of DHS confirmed the travel on 
the same flight of an identified trafficker, his alleged newborn and 
individuals from another separate bogus CRBA case. CAA also provided 
the full names and dates of birth for individuals in old ACS files 
that registered bogus births. Using that information with 
Lexis/Nexis helped identify the locations of couples who had 
successfully smuggled a newborn to the United States. Finally, the 
FPM and A/RSO-I met with the fraud prevention representatives of 
Western embassies to brief them on the case. Afterwards, the 
Canadian Embassy undertook a comprehensive review of almost 300 
cases, identifying about a dozen that were suspect and subsequently 
referring those to SSIS. 
 
 
 
The NIV case 
------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The FPU has been able to identify one case where the baby 
trafficking network has utilized NIVs to get newborns to the United 
States. In this particular case, a 50-year old doctor who had been 
previously identified in two separate ACS cases as falsely attesting 
to delivering babies, applied for a visa with his alleged newborn. 
The doctor claimed to be traveling without his wife to visit a 
Coptic priest in the United States. When the wife was questioned by 
SSIS, she claimed she knew nothing of a newborn although she was 
listed on the birth certificate. In addition, ADIS checks confirmed 
that this doctor and newborn were on the same flight with a couple 
who, six months previously, had been unsuccessful in an attempt to 
falsely document a newborn in ACS. The FPU continues to review NIV 
records for other possible similar cases.  In addition, a set of 
parameters has been passed to the CCD Adhoc team with a request for 
reports on NIV, IV and DV cases to determine whether other newborns 
have traveled to the United States based on fraudulent documents.
