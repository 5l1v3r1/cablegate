¶1.  ESTHOFF passed reftel points January 10 to several senior 
level contacts in the Spanish Agency for International 
Cooperation (AECI), urging Spain to dispatch a 
ministerial-level delegation to the January 25 Lebanon 
conference in Paris and to announce additional financial 
support for Lebanon at the conference.  AECI informed ESTHOFF 
January 18 that Foreign Minister Moratinos will head the 
Spanish delegation in Paris, but that Spain will not/not 
announce any new contribution for Lebanon at this time. 
 
¶2.  Spain announced a 31.5 million euro contribution for 
Lebanon at the August 2006 Stockholm conference.  6.5 million 
euro of the 31.5 million euro was for emergency humanitarian 
assistance in the immediate aftermath of the war.  The 
remaining 25 million euro is targeted at 
development/reconstruction assistance.  5 million euro of 
this 25 million euro was obligated and spent in late 2006. 
10 million euro of the remaining 20 million euro will be 
provided in 2007 and the final 10 million euro in 2008.
