Republic of Chad 
Presidency of the Republic 
The President 
 
N'Djamena, 10 March 2006 
 
Mr. President, 
 
I was most satisfied with the contents of your letter of 
February 8.  It leads us to think that you share our disquiet 
about the growing instabiilty on the border with Sudan. 
Thank you for your appreciation of the innumerable 
difficulties which my country faces on account of the burden 
of refugees from Darfur and the permanent insecurity in this 
region. 
 
I am well aware of and very grateful to you for all the 
efforts which the United States and the United Nations 
Security Council exert for resolving these problems.  On the 
ground, the situation worsens and our neighbors continue 
tirelessly to threaten the life and property of our citizens 
and the refugees.  This act of war considerably undermines 
the integrity and development of my country, which is already 
so difficult to put in place and for which we fight now.  I 
believe that we cannot guarantee peace in this zone without a 
more forceful action on the part of our friends, including 
the United States. 
 
In reiterating my gratitude for the reaffirmation of your 
cooperation and support, I would ask you to accept, Mr. 
President, this expression of my very high consideration. 
 
Idriss Deby Itno 
 
His Excellency 
Mr. George W. Bush 
President of the United States of America 
Washington, DC   USA
