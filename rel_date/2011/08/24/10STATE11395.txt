Dear Ambassador Scobey, 
 
I would like to extend my deep appreciation to you and your 
entire team at Embassy Cairo for facilitating the visits of 
so many high-level visitors to Cairo in the last few weeks, 
including very senior military and intelligence officials, 
Special Envoy Mitchell, Assistant Secretary Posner, Science 
Envoy Zewail, Deputy SRAP Feldman's delegation, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary Wittes, and the USCIRF delegation. 
Embassy Cairo's success in making each of these important 
visits as productive as possible has contributed 
significantly to our efforts to build a strong and 
constructive partnership with the Government of Egypt.  Your 
superb preparations for and orchestration of each of these 
visits, all coming at around the same time, enabled the USG 
to engage in crucial comprehensive discussions with the GOE 
on a range of important issues and to maximize the impact of 
each visit. 
 
I greatly appreciate everything you and your team did to make 
these visits such a success.  The commitment and 
professionalism of Embassy Cairo sets an example for us all. 
 
Best, 
 
Jeffrey Feltman 
Assisant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs
