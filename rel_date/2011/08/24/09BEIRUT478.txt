SUBJECT:  Lebanon: Media Reaction - April 27, 2009 
 
Atmospherics: 
------------- 
 
The media's reaction to Secretary Clinton's brief April 26 visit to 
Lebanon ranged between positive and cautious.  Pro-March 14 media 
outlets viewed the visit as a confirmation of the United States' 
deep commitment to Lebanon.  Opposition media outlets were not as 
enthusiastic.  They felt that the visit did not offer anything new 
of quality but noted appreciatively that the Secretary did not 
provoke a big part of the Lebanese with her statements, limiting her 
visits to the "only two sites on which the Lebanese have no 
disagreements."

"Clinton in Beirut: Success Because Of Rice!" an editorial by Talal 
Salman in Arab nationalist As-Safir (4/27): 
 
"It is not really reassuring for the Lebanese to see that their 
country was the third on Secretary Clinton's secret visits in the 
region following Iraq and Kuwait. We are afraid that the Obama 
Administration might have placed Lebanon within the framework of 
countries that were liberated by the United States...particularly 
since the March 14 leadership believes that it succeeded in 
liberating Lebanon by depending on the American open support ...On 
another note, the Lebanese look with appreciation to President 
Obama's message of support to President Suleiman. ...The Lebanese 
also appreciate the fact that Secretary Clinton did not ask the 
March 14 leaders to meet her somewhere...the way...her predecessor 
did. ...The Lebanese also noted that Secretary Clinton...kept her 
statement on general issues and focused on the changes in President 
Obama's policy towards the region...As for March 14 leaders, 
probably they did not pay attention to the changes in the U.S. 
policy...and probably were not happy to see Clinton in ut at this 
particular moment..." 
 
"Hillary in Looks and Content," an editorial by Wassef Awada in Arab 
nationalist As-Safir (4/27): 
 
"It was good that Secretary Clinton limited her visit to the 
Presidential palace and Hariri's gravesite.  Perhaps these two 
places are the only ones which the Lebanese do not have 
disagreements about.  ...Perhaps it is difficult to understand the 
American policy towards Lebanon...but it seems that the United 
States of Obama Clinton is different that the United States of Bush 
Rice.  ...Clinton avoided provoking an important part of the 
Lebanese.  ...This is an achievement by an Administration which is 
still carrying the inheritance of the former Administration ..." 
 
"Clinton's Visit Showed That New U.S. Thinking Has Yet to 
Materialize," an unsigned editorial in English-language, 
Beirut-based The Daily Star (4/27): 
 
"Hillary Clinton's whirlwind visit to Lebanon...generated the 
expected sound bits.  There was also a signal that new foreign 
policy thinking by the Obama Administration when it comes to this 
part of the Middle East, has yet to materialize.  The US Secretary 
of State's surprise touchdown didn't contain any surprises. 
...Clinton should identify policies - and not principles that would 
enable Lebanon to play its supposedly fundamental role in a Middle 
East peace..."
