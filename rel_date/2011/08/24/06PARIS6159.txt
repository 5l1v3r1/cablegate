SUBJECT: COMMERCIAL GM DESTRUCTIONS CONDEMNED; FARMERS STAND THEIR 
GROUND 
 
REF: Paris 5262 
 
¶1.  Summary:  In the past several months, anti-Genetically Modified 
Organisms (GMOs) groups have destroyed several commercial biotech 
corn plantings.  The latest incidents occurred on July 30 (see 
reftel), and September 2.  The French Ministry of Agriculture 
reacted strongly and quickly to condemn both.  France's largest 
farmers union and the French Corn Growers Organization also firmly 
reacted, organizing demonstrations in favor of the freedom to grow 
biotech crops. Despite the destructions, biotech corn production is 
on the rise.  End summary. 
 
¶1.  On September 2, anti-biotech activists destroyed another 
commercial field of biotech corn.  The French Minister of 
Agriculture quickly and vigorously condemned this action, as was the 
case after the first destruction.  He called these activities 
"irresponsible acts of vandalism" and emphasized that French farmers 
are the victims of these illegal actions. 
 
¶2.  For the first time, the largest farmers union in France(FNSEA) 
also reacted.  In a press communiqu, FNSEA said that the activists 
"have no union, political, or scientific legitimacy and terrorize 
farmers."  FNSEA called on the GOF to take steps to prevent future 
illegal activities against biotech corn plantings. 
 
¶3.  As the most actively pro-biotech stakeholder, the French Corn 
Growers Association (AGPM) has been the most vocal in its protests, 
announcing that a demonstration will be held in late September at 
its headquarters in southwestern France against GM field 
destructions and in favor of modern agriculture based on 
biotechnology.  AGPM has organized other demonstrations of farmers 
in favor of the right to grow biotech corn. In its communiqus, AGPM 
has stated corn growers affected by the destructions were 
"economically and personally prejudiced." 
 
¶4.  Comment: Tension on the issue of biotech cultivation is 
building, with the looming 2007 elections (for seats in the French 
Chambers of Agriculture, at the Parliament and for the President). 
While the biotech bill lingers in the French Parliament, some French 
farmers are ever more determined to continue their cultivation of 
biotech products, destructions notwithstanding.  Total 2006 biotech 
corn acreage is estimated at 4,000 to 5,000 ha, as compared to 500 
ha in 2005. While there are some positive developments, the French 
authorities could be more aggressive.  The Embassy will continue to 
raise our concern that biotech crops be protected.  End comment.
