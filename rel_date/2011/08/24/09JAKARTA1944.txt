¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive But Unclassified.  Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 24 the Indonesian National Police (INP) 
replaced General Susno Duadji, head of the INP's Criminal 
Investigation Division (CID).  An INP spokesman stated the 
move was part of routine personnel rotations among senior 
police officials.  However, Duadji's removal surprised many 
observers given that the INP had suspended him a few days 
earlier only to reinstate him shortly thereafter (see 
reftel).  Additionally, national police chief Bambang 
Hendarso Danuri had said that no senior police officials 
would resign in connection with several ongoing 
controversies.  General Ito Sumardi, currently a senior 
advisor to INP Chief Danuri, will take over leadership of the 
CID.  (Note:  Bio information on General Sumardi follows in 
paragraph 3.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Activists hailed the move and pointed to Duadji's 
alleged involvement in the ongoing controversy between the 
INP and the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK).  (Note: 
Mission will provide a full update on the controversy via 
septel.)  Duadji was identified in wiretapped conversations 
with prosecutors, businessmen and other police officials. 
Supporters of the KPK claimed that the conversations were 
part of a plot to frame two KPK commissioners, who were 
indicted on charges of criminal misconduct but were released 
following disclosure of the tapes. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Biographical Information:  Police Inspector General 
Ito Sumardi has served as a senior advisor to INP Chief 
Bambang Hendarso Danuri since January 2009.  Prior to that, 
he served as police chief in Riau and South Sumatra 
provinces.  He was security commander for the Aceh Peace 
Monitoring Mission and a commander of the INP's humanitarian 
task forces following the December 2004 Aceh tsunami.  He 
also commanded a UN police contingent in Eastern Slavonia, 
Croatia.  Sumardi was born in Bogor, West Java, on June 17, 
1953, and entered the police academy in 1977.  He holds 
advanced degrees in criminal law and business administration. 
 In October 2009 he participated in the USG-sponsored Rule of 
Law Forum and traveled to Washington, DC, and Texas.
