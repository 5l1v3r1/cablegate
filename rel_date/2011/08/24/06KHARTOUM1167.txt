SUBJECT:  UPDATE ON DDR 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) There has been recent incremental movement 
toward disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration 
(DDR) in Southern Sudan; the process of demobilizing 
child soldiers is underway in Malakal, and is scheduled 
to begin in Abyei later this month.  To date, 
approximately 1,200 child soldiers have been demobilized, 
according to UN sources.  On May 3, a GoSS decree named 
Arop Majok as the Commissioner for DDR, a role that he 
has played in an ad hoc fashion for some time. 
 
¶2. (SBU) There is widespread speculation/expectation that 
a portion of the increased budget for the SPLA (septel) 
might be used as a buyout for SPLA troops.  No one from 
the SPLA or GoSS has been able to confirm that this has 
been decided. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The World Bank has engaged a retired Ethiopian 
general to work with the SPLA on force restructuring.  He 
has met with senior SPLA commanders, but no 
downsizing/restructuring plan has as yet been released.
