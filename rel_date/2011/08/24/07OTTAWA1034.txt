REF: A. STATE 69315 
 
     ¶B. STATE 69283 
 
¶1.  (SBU) We conveyed ref A and B points on May 23 to 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) 
Senior Non-Proliferation Policy Adviser Craig Weichel, and 
followed-up on May 30 and 31. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Weichel said Canada agreed with the U.S. that 
interested governments could meet to discuss possible ways to 
share denial information with the IAEA Secretariat.  They 
could do so, he said, to the extent that such information 
would assist the Agency in implementing the relevant UNSCRs 
and investigating procurement networks that may have arisen 
in an effort to bypass UNSCR-mandated sanctions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Canada was also willing, he said, to discuss the 
proposal to share denial information with the relevant UNSCR 
implementation committees.  Canadian authorities would not 
agree, however, with the proposal to share denial information 
with selected non-NSG states, given that such 
information-sharing would, in the GOC's view, represent an 
unnecessary level of risk for NSG confidentiality. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Weichel noted that, according to the Canadian 
Mission in Vienna, the June 4 meeting may have been postponed 
until after the June Board of Governors meeting.  That said, 
he noted that the Canadians were ready to participate in the 
meeting whenever it takes place.
