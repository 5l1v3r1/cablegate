 ¶1. (U)  Post has confirmed with the GoU that Ukraine 
posesses Mi-8 MTV helicopters, most of which are in need of 
substantial refurbishment, but which are comparable in 
general terms to the Mi-17.  On June 2, contacts at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense 
indicated that Ukraine may be interested in exploring a 
proposal to supply helicopters to Pakistan, particularly in 
light of Ukraine's long-standing strategic cooperation with 
the United States and the West.  They anticipate that Ukraine 
would be most interested in a possible sale, but did not rule 
out other options. 
 
Comment 
------- 
¶2. (U)  Ukraine's inventory of Mi-8 MTVs is in need of 
substantial investment/refurbishment.  While the time line is 
likely to be mid-term at best, it could be worth exploring a 
potential sale or lease to the Government of Pakistan.  Post 
notes that a U.S. and UN joint team is planning a trip to 
Ukraine in late June to explore the possibility of sourcing 
helicopters for Darfur from Ukraine. Washington might wish to 
consider whether including an expert on that team who could 
look into the potential for sourcing helicopters for Pakistan 
from Ukraine as well. End Comment.
