LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR ZIMBABWE'S YEAR 2000 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS PREPARED BY THE USAID MISSION IN 
HARARE: 
 
BACKGROUND: THE U.S. GOVERNMENT (USG) IS PROVIDING 
SUBSTANTIAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT ELECTION ACTIVITIES IN 
ZIMBABWE.  THIS ASSISTANCE RANGES FROM SUPPORTING DOMESTIC 
MONITORING TO AUDITING THE VOTERS' ROLL.  MOST 
SIGNIFICANTLY, USG ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR 
10,200 DOMESTIC MONITORS, WHICH AT THE CURRENT NUMBER OF 
POLLING STATIONS AMOUNTS TO THREE MONITORS PER STATION.  WE 
ARE ALSO PROVIDING TRAINING TO POLITICAL PARTIES FOR POLLING 
AGENTS, AND IF PREDICTIONS STAND, THIS WILL RESULT IN SIX 
POLLING AGENTS PER STATION.  ALL TOLD, THE USG IS PROVIDING 
TIMELY AND IMPORTANT ASSISTANCE THAT WILL HELP TO ENSURE 
THAT ELECTORAL SYSTEMS WILL BE MONITORED, AUDITED, AND 
STRENGTHENED.

  EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY FIVE MONITORS PER STATION.  WE CAN 
  CONFIRM THE ZCC AND NCA NUMBERS WHICH MEANS THAT THE USG IS 
  PROVIDING FUNDING FOR 10,200 DOMESTIC MONITORS WHICH AT THE 
  CURRENT NUMBER OF POLLING STATIONS AMOUNTS TO THREE MONITORS 
  PER STATION.  FUNDING OF MONITORS FOR THESE OTHER

  STATION AND WITH THESE ESTIMATED NUMBERS, THAT GOAL WILL BE 
  ATTAINED.

  AGENTS FOR EACH PARTY IS AS FOLLOWS:  MDC (8,000 TO 10,000); 
  ZANU-PF (8,000 TO 10,000); AND ZUD, ZIP, UP, AND SAPU (TOTAL 
  FOR ALL FOUR PARTIES: 120).  ALL TOLD, 20,120 POLLING AGENTS 
  WILL ALSO BE MONITORING THE ELECTION.  IF THERE ARE 3,600 
  POLLING STATIONS, THEN THIS EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY SIX 
  POLLING AGENTS PER STATION. (NDI)

  IN 30 CONSTITUENCIES WILL BE TESTED.  IF RESEARCH SHOWS VAST 
  PROBLEMS, FUNDS MAY BE UTILIZED TO MOUNT A COURT CASE TO 
  STOP ELECTIONS.  TRAINING OF 120 ENUMERATORS WILL BEGIN IN 
  THE SECOND WEEK OF APRIL FOR FIVE DAYS IN EACH CONSTITUENCY.
