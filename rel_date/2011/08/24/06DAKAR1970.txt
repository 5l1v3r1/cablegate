¶1.  SUMMARY: The Government of Senegal (GOS) has selected 
the textile and apparel sector as a strategic growth 
sector for its Accelerated Growth Strategy.  Although 
Senegalese companies continue to have limited, domestic 
production of cloth and finished apparel, companies are 
making noticeable efforts to modernize in order to export 
apparel to the U.S. market under the African Growth and 
Opportunity Act (AGOA).  Most of these companies import 
fabrics from Asia and Europe because they are not produced 
in large quantities domestically.  Overall, the private 
sector supports extension of the third country fabric 
provision.  END SUMMARY. 
 
APIX EFFORTS TO REVITALIZE THE INDUSTRY 
--------------------------------------- 
¶2.  Senegal's Investment Promotion Agency (APIX) reports 
that many textile factories in Senegal are dormant.  The 
agency is currently researching strategies to modernize 
some industrial textile facilities, to provide incentives 
for foreign direct investment in the sector, and to 
organize the artisan level -- apparel/confection sub- 
sector.  Businesses operating in Senegal report lack of 
financing, erratic and costly electricity, unskilled 
labor, and low worker productivity as challenges to 
expansion.  A recent study commissioned by APIX recommends 
the establishment of a Textile Promotion Center to 
revitalize trade associations, improve technical 
information and training, and promote lobbying.  This 
center does exist but is not operational due to lack of 
financing. 
 
BUT PRODUCTION IS STILL LOW 
--------------------------- 
¶3.  Meanwhile, Senegal's textile companies continue to 
have limited domestic production of cloth and finished 
apparel.  Although some companies still do not operate at 
full capacity, some are in the process of expanding their 
production lines.  Garments manufactured at the industrial 
level include work uniforms, scrubs, t-shirts, sportswear 
and towels.  Senegal also has a thriving fashion sector 
with designs being crafted in traditional workshops for 
sale in niche Western markets. 
 
¶4.  Almost all fabrics are imported from Asia and higher- 
end wax fabric is imported from Europe to be printed and 
dyed with traditional, African designs in Senegal for sale 
in domestic and regional markets.  Sales are estimated at 
approximately 30 million meters per year.  Textile exports 
average less than five billion CFA francs (CFAF) (USD 9 
million dollars) per year.  Senegal also exports several 
hundred tons of thread per year to Europe, and there is 
regional demand for additional thread exports.  The low 
level of exports contrasts with the size of the domestic 
market, estimated at 130 billion CFAF (USD 260 million). 
A possible explanation for this is the used-clothing 
import industry, garment smuggling, and the undervaluation 
of apparel imports.  In 2005, the GOS reported 6,600 tons 
of used clothing valued at three billion CFAF (USD 6 
million). 
 
¶5.  Several small to medium-sized firms claim to be 
gearing up to take advantage of AGOA trade benefits and 
strongly support an extension of AGOA's third country 
fabric provision.  INDOSEN, a Senegalese company with 
Moroccan and Indian investment will receive Ex-ImBank 
financing to import digital equipment to improve its 
production of work uniforms to meet American demand. 
INDOSEN claims to have several orders in the pipeline, but 
it has not yet begun production and is currently in the 
process of training the local workforce.  It expects 
production will start in early September 2006.  Ets Solu 
and EGA Confection have also ordered digital machinery to 
increase production of sportswear and scrubs, 
respectively, for export to the U.S.  Both companies are 
working with the West African Trade Hub (WATH) in Accra to 
find American buyers.
