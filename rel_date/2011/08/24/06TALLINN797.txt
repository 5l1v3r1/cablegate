(U) On August 31 Poloff delivered reftel points on 
Iran to Marin Mottus, MFA Director for Middle East 
Affairs.  Acording to Mottus, the EU had hoped for a 
better reaction from Iran to the E3+3.  "Tehran did 
not make use of the opportunity to find a diplomatic 
solution for the conflict," she added.  If Iran 
fails to comply with UNSC Resolution 1696 by the 
August 31 deadline, Mottus said, the GOE's position 
is that the Security Council ought to begin 
discussing the implementation of sanctions.  Estonia 
will express this position at Gymnich, if Iran is on 
the agenda.
