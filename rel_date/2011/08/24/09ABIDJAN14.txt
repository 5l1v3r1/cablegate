Mister President: 
 
The celebration of the New Year 2009 gives me the pleasant 
opportunity to extend to you, on behalf of the Ivoirian 
people and government, and on my own behalf, my best wishes 
for a happy New Year. 
 
I am particularly happy to seize this pleasant opportunity to 
underline how much I appreciate the excellent quality of the 
relations of friendship and cooperation existing between the 
Republic of Cote d'Ivoire and the United States of America, 
as well as the delicate and very much appreciated attention 
that you have given to them throughout your two mandates at 
the highest office of your country. 
 
While expressing to you my profound gratitude, I would like 
to assure you of my determination to continue, with your 
successor, our striving for strengthening the links of 
friendship and cooperation that so fortunately unite our two 
countries, and our noble struggle for the triumph of our 
common ideals of justice, freedom and peace. 
 
With my highest consideration. 
 
Laurent Gbagbo 
President of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire
