SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT EDITOR MARK CHAVUNDHUKA DIES 
 
¶1.   The November 10 death of journalist Mark 
    Chavundhuka represents a loss to Zimbabwe's independent 
    media.  Chavundhuka was founding editor of the 
    independent weekly "Standard," a position he held 
    through April 2002.  He died Monday night at a private 
    hospital in Harare after "a long illness."  Friends and 
    family knew that Mark had been living with AIDS for 
    several years. 
 
¶2.   Chavhunduka and his chief reporter Ray Choto (now 
    at Stanford University) made international headlines in 
    1999 when they were arrested and tortured after the 
    "Standard" published a report alleging an attempted 
    coup in the Zimbabwean military.  Chavundhuka was a 
    Niemann fellow in the 1999-2000 academic year. 
 
¶3.   At the time of his death Chavhunduka had just made 
    history by becoming Zimbabwe's youngest publisher.  In 
    April Chavhunduka acquired majority shares in Thompson 
    Publications - owners of Zimbabwe's largest circulating 
    monthly magazine "Parade" - and was the company's Chief 
    Executive Officer.
