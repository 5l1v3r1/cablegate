SUBJECT: GERMAN FEDERAL PROSECUTOR DECLINES INVESTIGATING 
EUCOM FOR ALLEGED RENDITIONS 
 
REF: BERLIN 3447 
 
¶1. (SBU) German Federal Prosecutor Monika Harms has decided 
that she is not responsible for investigating six EUCOM 
officers in Stuttgart for allegedly planning the kidnapping 
and rendition of six Algerian nationals from Sarajevo to 
Guantanamo Bay via Germany in 2002, according to December 29 
German news reports.  According to her spokesman, "kidnapping 
in the framework of fighting terrorism does not fall under 
the criminal offense of abduction, for which political 
persecution is presumed." 
 
¶2. (SBU) USAREUR and EUCOM contacts commented to Emboff that 
this is "good news" for the U.S. Forces in Europe.  The EUCOM 
contact said the federal prosecutor's decision not to pursue 
an investigation in this particular case clarifies a general 
principle that should be applied to similar cases in the 
future.  (Note:  Harm is following a precedent set in 2004 by 
her predecessor Kay Nehm, who declined to investigate the 
alleged "abduction" by CIA officers of Egyptian national Abu 
Omar.  Nehm also ruled that the alleged CIA "abduction" was 
not the result of political persecution and referred the case 
back to local prosecutors.  End note.) Nevertheless, 
according to the German news accounts, the local Stuttgart 
prosecutor's office still has the option of pursuing an 
investigation of its own on different charges. 
¶3. (SBU) Post is continuing to follow this case and will 
report additional substantive information septel.
