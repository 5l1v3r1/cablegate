SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. A power struggle beginning in January 2009 that led to an 
unconstitutional transfer of power has resulted in a severe shock to 
the economy of Madagascar and a near paralysis of government 
capability to respond to humanitarian concerns emerging in the 
country.  The crisis has led to over 50,000 job losses in 
Antananarivo alone.  At the same time, unseasonably poor rainfall 
across Madagascar, particularly in the south, has compromised food 
security.  The UN is preparing a flash appeal to respond to the 
humanitarian concerns arising from this combination of economic and 
climatic shocks.  It is in the US interest to support humanitarian 
assistance in Madagascar.  Given these conditions, the Chief of the 
US Mission exercises authority to declare that a complex 
humanitarian disaster is in progress and requests an immediate USD 
50,000 for urgent humanitarian programming. USAID/OFDA and USAID/FFP 
are requested to continue to monitor the situation and support 
partners as determined appropriate. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶3. In January 2009, a power struggle broke out between the President 
of the Republic of Madagascar, Marc Ravalomanana, and opposition 
leader and former Antananarivo mayor, Andry Rajoelina.  President 
Marc Ravalomanana handed over power to the military on March 17, 
¶2009.  Power was subsequently handed to the opposition. Weeks of 
opposition protests and turmoil have taken the lives of more than 
150 people, and injured around 1,000. 
 
4 As a result of the political crisis, the socio-economic situation 
of Madagascar has declined drastically.  The crisis has severely 
destabilized the economy and resulted in a near halting of the 390 
million USD/year tourism industry.  A recent suspension of much 
international foreign development aid will exacerbate the plight of 
the nearly 70 percent of the Malagasy population living on less than 
1 USD/day. 
 
¶5. Among those particularly affected are vulnerable people living in 
the urban areas of several cities in Madagascar. This is manifested 
through increased unemployment, rising food prices, and 
deteriorating sanitation conditions due to limited functioning of 
public works and the incapacity of government to provide social 
services.  Some church groups in the capital of Antananarivo have 
indicated a fourfold increase in requests for assistance, as 
compared to the pre-crisis period. 
 
¶6. A preliminary assessment conducted by a group of agriculture and 
food security disaster actors (FAO, CRS, WFP and other local NGOs) 
demonstrates that over 50,000 people in the capital have lost their 
jobs due to lay-offs in export processing zones, closure of several 
private companies, suspension of income generating activities, and 
reduction in work force.  Lack of cash to purchase food is coupled 
with an increase in staple food/commodities prices and localized 
market shortages. 
 
¶7. In addition to direct impacts on health, nutrition, and overall 
food security, the crisis is taking a toll on the country's natural 
resource base, which is the primary source of livelihood for poor 
rural communities.  There are increased reports of opportunistic, 
unsustainable and illegal depletion of natural resources due to a 
lack of rule of law and dysfunction of the government.  Reports of 
potential human rights abuses inflicted by illegal operators and 
forest profiteers upon rural communities are also increasing, 
particularly in the northern forest areas.  These conditions 
undermine livelihoods and security of poor, rural communities. 
 
¶8. Significant rainfall shortages across the country have also 
contributed to growing food insecurity.  The December Early Warning 
System (EWS) bulletin generated by BNGRC "Bureau National de la 
Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes" reported that 31 communes 
in southern Madagascar were facing severe food insecurity due to a 
prolonged drought. April and May harvests are expected to fail in 
calendar year 2009 in Androy and Anosy regions.  An estimated 
150,000 people may soon be affected by food insecurity within these 
areas. 
 
¶9. As the government has effectively ceased to function during the 
crisis, regular food security monitoring for other vulnerable 
populations across Madagascar has not occurred.  However, 
preliminary assessments by USAID implementing partners, such as 
Adventist Development Relief Agency and CARE, indicate that affected 
communities are already employing significant coping strategies, 
including selling off livestock and household goods in order to 
purchase food. 
 
¶10. The Chief of Mission has determined that the impact of the 
political crisis on already vulnerable populations, particularly in 
urban and peri-urban areas, and the food insecurity across the 
country, particularly in southern Madagascar, are of sufficient 
magnitude to warrant US Government assistance.  The Chief of Mission 
is therefore exercising his disaster assistance authority. 
 
--------------- 
Action Required 
--------------- 
 
¶11. Due to the political crisis, significant rainfall shortages 
across the country, and significant food insecurity amongst 
vulnerable Malagasy populations, Post hereby declares a complex 
humanitarian disaster in Madagascar. 
 
¶12. Disaster assistance of USD 50,000 will be awarded to a joint 
group of UN agencies and NGOs to assess food insecurity in urban and 
rural priority districts. 
 
¶13. This cable requests support from USAID/OFDA and USAID/FFP to 
work with USAID Madagascar and its implementing partners to 
determine the size, scope and sector of any additional emerging 
humanitarian assistance requirements.  Post will continue to monitor 
and report on the situation.
