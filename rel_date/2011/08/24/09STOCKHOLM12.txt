PRESIDENCY AT UNDP 
 
REF: SECSTATE 1500 
 
POL Counselor delivered reftel demarche on January 9 to 
Ambassador Robert Rydberg, MFA Deputy Director General (A/S 
equivalent) for Middle East and North Africa Affairs. 
Rydberg stated that Sweden has a general policy of supporting 
candidates for leadership positions in international 
organizations if they are "unanimously endorsed" by their 
regional group.  POL Counselor repeated concerns about the 
impact of an Iranian presidency, including on UNDP 
credibility and the organization's ability to support gender 
equality and minority rights.  Rydberg replied that if Iran 
were elected and if it did indeed act in a manner that 
displayed a bias on gender issues or minority rights, then 
"you can count on us to adamantly oppose" that behavior.  But 
at this point, he added, Sweden would likely continue to be 
guided by its "firm, longstanding and principled" position of 
supporting candidates endorsed by their regional grouping.
