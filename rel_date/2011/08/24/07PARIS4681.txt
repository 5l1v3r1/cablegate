SUBJECT: PETERSON CASE: FRENCH MOJ RESPONSE TO COOK COUNTY, 
ILLINOIS STATE'S ATTORNEY 
 
REF: A. PARIS 4456 
     ¶B. STATE 146715 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy received a response from Jean-Marie Huet, 
A/S-equivalent for Criminal Affairs at the Ministry of 
Justice, on December 10, to the Office of the State's 
Attorney for Cook County, Illinois's request (reftel B) that 
the French government reconsider the nationality claim of 
Hans Peterson, wanted in Illinois for the October 2006 murder 
of Dr. David Cornbleet.  The letter, dated November 22, was 
transmitted to the Embassy by the MFA's Americas Bureau.  As 
expected, the GOF continues to deny Peterson's extradition to 
the U.S., claiming that French law does not allow for the 
extradition of its nationals beyond EU borders.  The French 
judiciary has initiated its own prosecution of the case, and 
asks in the letter for U.S. assistance in completing the 
investigation.  An informal translation of the letter is 
contained in paragraph two. A copy of the original text has 
been to e-mailed to State's France desk and the Office of the 
Legal Advisor.  We understand the original was sent via 
postal service to the Office of the State's Attorney for Cook 
County, Illinois. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy's informal translation of the Huet letter: 
 
Mr. Prosecutor, 
 
Your letter dated September 24 was received with the greatest 
attention. 
 
The case which you discuss is particularly distressing and we 
agree that it is highly likely that Mr. Hans Peterson came to 
France in order to avoid the American justice system, and we 
deplore this action. 
 
Concerning the possibility of extradition, I assure you that 
we have not spared any effort to find a solution which 
responds to your perfectly legitimate request. 
 
At the same time, as a result of French legislation as well 
as the stipulations in the U.S./France bilateral extradition 
Treaty, such a result is not foreseen. 
 
In fact, as you know, Mr. Hans Peterson has possessed French 
nationality since his birth and his presence on French 
territory does not allow us any other choice but to declare 
the impossibility of his extradition. 
 
Nevertheless, I hope to underline here the agility with which 
the French justice system has responded in placing Hans 
Peterson into preliminary detention since August 8, 2007.  An 
official investigation has begun based on the following 
charges: murder accompanied by, preceding, or following acts 
of torture or barbarism. 
 
I can also inform you that the prosecuting magistrate has 
already prepared an international letter rogatory addressed 
to your office, which you should receive in the briefest time 
possible through the Department of Justice.  In the framework 
of international judicial cooperation we will ask for your 
permission to authorize a French examining magistrate to 
travel to Chicago to attend to the execution of this letter 
rogatory under your care. 
 
It is in all of our interests, and notably in the interest of 
the family of the deceased, that Mr. Peterson be held 
accountable for his acts before the justice system.  This day 
of reckoning, to which I attach the greatest importance, is 
tied to the judicial cooperation between our two countries 
which have always been frank and loyal and find in this case 
a way to demonstrate the strength of that relationship. 
 
I assure you, Mr. Prosecutor, of my most distinguished 
consideration. 
 
Signed, 
Jean-Marie Huet
