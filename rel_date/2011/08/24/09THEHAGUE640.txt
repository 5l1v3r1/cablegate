¶1.  Econoff delivered reftel points to Hidde Baars, Policy 
Officer for Pakistan at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
(MFA).  Baars confirmed that the Government of the 
Netherlands (GONL) officially joined the Friends of 
Democratic Pakistan and pledged 86 million euro (USD 126.9 
million) at the Tokyo Donors Conference in April.  This 
amount is for the period 2009-2011; of that, the GONL has 
already spent 35 million euro (USD 51.6 million) this year. 
Baars noted that the GONL may pledge additional funds for 
Pakistan next year, but this is highly uncertain.  The GONL 
is facing a rising budget deficit, and the MFA (like all 
ministries) must make substantial spending cuts, including to 
its development budget.  Baars said that the 86 million euro 
is guaranteed for Pakistan through 2011; the MFA will decide 
next year whether to commit additional funds. 
 
¶2.  While it recognizes the Government of Pakistan,s budget 
pressures, the GONL maintains a policy of not providing 
direct budget support to Pakistan, citing a continued lack of 
transparency and accountability.  Instead, the GONL channels 
about two-thirds of its assistance through the Dutch Embassy 
in Islamabad to local and international NGOs for a range of 
projects in-country.  The GONL channels roughly one-third of 
its assistance to Pakistan through multilateral development 
institutions (primarily the World Bank), but this ratio could 
increase if the security situation deteriorates and/or NGOs 
are unable to conduct viable projects.  The GONL,s three 
priority areas for development assistance to Pakistan (those 
in which the GONL believes it can add the most value) are: 
(1) education, (2) good governance and human rights, and (3) 
environment and water.  Baars noted that these are "soft 
programs," but ones that the GONL conducts in risky areas. 
It has a program with UNICEF, for example, to educate 
traumatized children in the dangerous Malakand region.
