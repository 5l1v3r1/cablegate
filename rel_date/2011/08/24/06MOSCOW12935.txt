¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Villart Export, Elektrostal, Russia. The company 
was listed on BIS license number: D338936 as the 
ultimate consignee of an armored car, ECCN: 9A018.B 
These commodities are controlled for national security 
and regional stability reasons. The exporter is 
International Armoring Corp. 2335 Lincoln Ave., Ogden, 
UT 84401. 
 
¶3. On November 30, 2006, Export Control Attache Donald 
Pearce and FSN Natalya Shipitsina conducted the 
requested post-shipment verification with Villart 
Export, Elektrostal, Gorkogo st., 38, Russia. The 
export control team met with Aleksey Alekseev, General 
Director. 
 
¶4. Villart is a producer of electronic pay terminal 
systems used in Russia to process payments for 
cellular telephone services.  The company was founded 
seven years ago, and currently employs 500.  Villart 
also is a metal fabricator, producing metal enclosures 
and rack systems for electronics.  The company is 
headquartered in Elektrostal on the grounds of a large 
manufacturing plant, and also has a service center in 
Moscow. 
 
¶5.  The vehicle in reftel is used for the personal 
protection of Mr. Alekseev.  Two other employees have 
regular access to the vehicle, a driver and the deputy 
General Director, though Mr. Alekseev normally drives 
the vehicle himself.  When not in use the vehicle is 
parked on the grounds of the facility, or in the 
garage at Mr. Alekseev's residence.  Mr. Alekseev 
expressed disappointment in the quality of the 
armoring provided.  Specific complaints included 
broken components in the door window systems, cheap 
external mirrors, a cracked windshield that cost over 
5000 USD to repair, and faulty door seals that do not 
prevent precipitation from entering the vehicle. 
 
¶6. The team was shown a GM-American General Hummer H2, 
Vehicle Identification Number 5GRGN23U75H121206. 
Digital photos were taken and are available from post 
upon request. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Villart Export, 
Elektrostal, Russia as reliable recipient of sensitive 
U.S. origin commodities.
