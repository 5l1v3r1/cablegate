SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: POST-SHIPMENT VERIFICATION: 
ROTEK TTC, ENTHOZIASTOV HIGHWAY, MOSCOW, RUSSIA, 
LICENSE NO. NLR 
 
REFTEL: USDOC 04031 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to 
determine the legitimacy and reliability of the end- 
user, Rotek TTC, Enthoziastov Highway, Moscow, Russia. 
The company is listed on BIS license application: NLR 
as the ultimate consignee of six (6) HMC489LP5 high 
dynamic range surface mount amplifiers.  ECCN 3A001. 
Controlled for anti-terrorism (AT), missile technology 
(MT) and nuclear non-proliferation (NP) reasons. The 
exporter is Hittite Microwave Corporation, 20 Alpha 
Road, Chelmsford, MA  01824. 
 
¶3. Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Political Specialist Boris Karasyov contacted 
representatives of Rotek LLC by telephone and email 
regarding the reftel commodity and its alleged 
importation into Russia.  No on-site PSV was conducted 
at Rotek TTC because Rotek TTC never received the 
shipment of six (6) HMC489LP5 high dynamic range 
surface mount amplifiers identified in reftel. 
 
¶4.  According to Alexey Menshuten, the Director- 
Coordinator of the group of companies Rotek TTC, 
Rotek-TC, Rotek-Elpom, Rotek NPK and Rotek Telecom; 
and Alexander Brazhnikov, Director General of Rotek 
TC; Hittite Microwave Corporation shipped six (6) 
HMC489LP5 high dynamic range surface mount amplifiers 
to Rotek TTC via FedEx in 2006 after completing the 
licensing process.  However, because Rotek TTC was not 
registered as an importer/exporter in Russia, Russian 
Customs did not allow the shipment to clear customs 
and returned it to Hittite.  Rotek TTC claims that 
they have never received the reftel commodity even 
though they did request a re-shipment from Hittite. 
 
¶5. Recommendations: Post was not able to conduct PSV 
and therefore cannot recommend Rotek LLC, Moscow, 
Russia as reliable recipients of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
