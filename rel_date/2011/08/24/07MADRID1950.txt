¶2. EconCouns and EconOff met with the Minister of Industry, 
Tourism and Trade's (Joan Clos) Chief of Staff, Marc Murtra, 
and Industry Advisor Bruno Fernandez Scrimieri, on 10/4/07. 
EconOff queried Murtra on the Ministry's thinking on the 
Rosalini case.  Murtra said that Rosalini should consider the 
Barcelona Forum's offer to settle because although the offer 
did not come close to the damages awarded by the court in 
Cook County, Illinois, it was far more generous than awarded 
in similar cases in Spain.  The Chief of Staff added that 
Rosalini should consider the fact that Clos might not be a 
minister after the next general elections in Spain, which 
must be held by March 2008 at the latest.  Murtra suggested 
that Clos was the Spanish politician with the greatest 
interest in settling the case, and that other future 
ministers would likely have much less interest in settling.
