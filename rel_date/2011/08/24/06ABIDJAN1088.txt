¶1. Air Traffic Controllers:  As of 1500 GMT September 27th, 
the strike of the 27 Ivorian employees of the Agency for 
Aeronautical Security in Africa (ASECNA), which operates air 
traffic control at Abidjan's airport, was suspended for one 
month, allowing a full resumption of both domestic and 
international flights.  According to local press reports, the 
local employees of ASECNA accepted a "personal" commitment by 
President Gbagbo to take their grievances to the ASECNA board 
of governors.  The Ivorian controllers are demanding a pay 
increase of 2 million CFA per month (approximately $3,877, a 
considerable sum here) as well as improvements to air traffic 
equipment.  New Transport Minister Abdel Aziz Thiam, a 
technocratic former director of Cote d'Ivoire's railroad 
network (who was brought in to replace the former Minister 
who has been implicated in the ongoing toxic waste scandal), 
decried the "illegal" nature of the strike.  He also 
expressed exasperation that the demands were presented to the 
Ivorian government and not ASECNA directly. 
 
¶2. Bank Employees:  As of 1200 GMT September 28th, this 
strike continues, despite attempts by President Gbagbo 
personally to bring it to resolution.  In a widely reported 
snub, the banking workers' union failed to show up to a 
meeting with the President scheduled for 1600 GMT, September 
27th.  Government authorities have stated publicly that the 
strike is illegal, due to the union's failure to provide six 
days notice as well as its failure to respect the formal 
negotiating period.  However, banking company executives have 
not yet threatened to fire striking employees. 
 
¶3. Customs Agents Threatening:  Customs agents have renewed 
their threats to shut down the country's ports in protest 
over the continued detention of three of their members in 
connection with the toxic waste dumping scandal.  According 
to press reports, that action would begin on October 2nd.
