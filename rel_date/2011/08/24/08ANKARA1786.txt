In Today's Papers 
 
Justice Minister Apologizes for Detainee's Death in Prison 
Media outlets report Justice Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin apologized 
yesterday to the family of Engin Ceber, a leftist activist who was 
beaten to death while in state custody in Istanbul last week.  Ceber 
was detained September 28 for distributing a leftist publication. 
He died in the hospital on Saturday from a brain hemorrhage caused 
by multiple blows to the head.  According to the reports, Ceber was 
first beaten by policemen and then he was beaten by guards after he 
was transferred to Metris Prison.  Sahin said that Justice Ministry 
inspectors confirmed Ceber was tortured, and he suspended 19 
officials for their involvement in mistreatment.  Papers underline 
that this was the first time the state apologized for the death of a 
detainee in custody.  Turkish Human Rights Foundation Director Yavuz 
Onen said 29 suspicious prison deaths have been reported this year. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Torture in Turkey 
 
Oktay Eksi writes in mainstream Hurriyet:  "Justice Minister Sahin 
apologized to the family of Engin Ceber, who recently was tortured 
to death while in state custody.  Moreover, Sahin banned 19 
officials from their duties.  This is definitely a good start. 
However, PM Erdogan promised two years ago to put an end to torture 
in Turkey, but he was not successful in keeping his promise. 
Reports from the Turkey Human Rights Foundation show that 11 people 
in custody died from torture in 2006.  That number climbed to 29 
deaths due to torture in 2008!" 
 
Papers Question Security Flaws in Aktutun Attack 
Milliyet, Sabah, Vatan and Zaman carry a report from leftist Taraf 
yesterday, which documented aerial images taken by unmanned aircraft 
showing a buildup of PKK forces prior to the attack on the Aktutun 
military outpost on the border with Iraq.  Papers echo Taraf's 
initial concern that the military had information indicating a 
possible attack on the outpost, but did nothing to stop the attack 
or warn the outpost of the attack. The Taraf story claimed yesterday 
drone planes were sending pictures of the PKK buildup to Turkish 
General Staff (TGS) HQ at 09:35 a.m. on the day of the attack, more 
than three hours before the raid on Aktutun was launched.  Taraf 
also claimed TGS was given intelligence reports which began warning 
of an impending Aktutun attack up to one month before the attack was 
carried out.  Papers inquire why the authorities did not move to 
prevent the attack.  Mainstream Vatan noted that the U.S. did 
provide TGS with intelligence indicating a buildup of PKK forces up 
to ten kilometers over the border in northern Iraq. 
 
Barzani Pledges Cooperation in the Fight against the PKK 
All papers: Turkey's special envoy for Iraq Murat Ozcelik led a 
Turkish delegation to Baghdad for meetings with Iraqi Kurdish 
Regional Government President Massoud Barzani, Iraqi President Jalal 
Talabani and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in yesterday. 
Ozcelik told Barzani that the KRG should cut logistical support to 
PKK.  Mainstream Sabah reports that the main issue of the meeting 
was the border security and cooperation in fight against terrorism. 
While the Kurdish officials did not make any statements regarding 
the meeting, Ozcelik said "it was positive" but he did not give any 
details about the meeting.  Papers quote Maliki as saying "I am 
ashamed that the PKK is using Iraqi soil for its activities." 
Islamist-oriented Zaman quotes U.S. Embassy Ankara Spokesperson 
Kathryn Schalow comments regarding the increased cooperation between 
Iraq and Turkey, "This is a positive development.  We've been 
encouraging Turkey's dialogue with Iraqi authorities, including 
representatives of Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government." 
 
New Measures in the Fight against Terrorism 
Sabah, Milliyet, Turkiye, Zaman, Hurriyet, Cumhuriyet, Radikal and 
others:  Papers report that the High Board of Counter-Terrorism 
convened under the chairmanship of PM Erdogan on Tuesday.  The board 
decided to establish an under-secretariat within the Interior

Ministry that will focus solely on security and counter-terrorism 
efforts.  This initiative places the management of the fight against 
terrorism in civilian hands.  The military will be responsible for 
border security and external threats.  Professional security forces 
will be responsible for domestic terror threats. 
 
Editorial Commentary on Turkey-Iraq/PKK 
 
Fikret Bila writes in mainstream Milliyet:  "Turkey's special envoy 
to Iraq Murat Ozcelik gave positive signals following his meeting 
with KRG President Massoud Barzani.  Of course, it is still too 
early to define the concrete cooperation between Ankara and the 
Iraqi Kurdish Regional Government.  There isn't even a joint action 
plan yet.  This meeting was just a preliminary agreement.  In the 
past, Turkey has worked with Barzani and Talabani from time to time. 
 However, Ankara doesn't fully trust Barzani and Iraqi President 
Jalal Talabani.  Today, the U.S. has a more active role in the 
region compared to the 1990s.  U.S. policies will determine the 
outcome of Turkey's cooperation with the KRG and Ankara is well 
aware of it." 
 
Abdulhamit Bilici writes in Islamist-oriented Zaman: "We have 
witnessed rapprochement between the Americans and the Sunnis in 
Iraq.  Given the impending American presidential elections and the 
ongoing financial crisis, it's doubtful to what extent the U.S. can 
meet the Kurds' exaggerated demands.  All these facts are forcing 
the Kurds to be realistic.  Turkey's special Iraq envoy Murat 
Ozcelik's meeting with Massoud Barzani is no coincidence.  And 
there's even talk of President Gul's possible participation in the 
opening ceremony of Erbil airport, which was built by Turkish 
businessmen.  The new goal of the Turkish government is to force the 
Kurdish Regional Government to display a clearer stance against the 
PKK, and find a way to eliminate a common threat.  Time will show 
whether this effort will yield results or not." 
 
Mustafa Unal writes in Islamist-oriented Zaman: "The opposition's 
'buffer zone' formula on Iraq border is not anything that can be 
implemented by Turkey alone.  Such a move would require approval 
from Iraq, neighboring countries, and the international community. 
A buffer zone would mean expanding Turkey's borders into Iraq, and 
it's not easy to persuade the Iraqi administration on this matter. 
In the coming days, additional cooperation between northern Iraq and 
Baghdad will be the main elements of Turkey's fight against terror. 
There is no need to worry - terror summits did not always result in 
a green light for martial law.  Now Turkey will begin a new period 
of active struggle against terror."
