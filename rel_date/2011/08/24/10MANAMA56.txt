SUBJECT: INPUT FOR FORCED LABOR AND CHILD LABOR REPORTS 
 
REF: A. STATE 131997 
     ¶B. 09 MANAMA 31 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: There were no reports of forced labor in the 
production of goods in Bahrain in 2009, nor were there 
reports of exploitative child labor, trafficking of children, 
or commercial sexual exploitation of children.  End Summary. 
 
FORCED/CHILD LABOR IN THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
 
¶2. (U) With respect to ref A tasking 1: Bahrain produces 
negligible agricultural commodities, and, with the exception 
of oil, gas, and aluminum, negligible manufactured goods. 
There were no reports of forced labor or exploitative child 
labor in the production of raw materials (i.e., oil and gas) 
or finished products (i.e., aluminum products).  Companies in 
these sectors tend to be large, state-controlled entities 
(e.g., BAPCO and Alba), with strong compliance with GOB labor 
laws and active trade unions. 
 
EXPLOITATIVE CHILD LABOR 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = 
 
¶3. (U) With respect to ref A tasking 2: Child labor in 
Bahrain is infrequent, and tends to be in family-owned and 
-operated shops.  There were no reports of children involved 
in hazardous child labor, forced child labor, trafficking, or 
commercial sexual exploitation. 
 
¶4. (U) The GOB did not enact new laws or regulations 
concerning child labor in 2009.  The 1976 Labor Law for the 
Private Sector, as amended, continues to generally prohibit 
the employment of children under the age of 16.  Juveniles 
between ages 14 and 16 may obtain official authorization to 
work from the Ministry of Labor (MOL) if they can prove an 
urgent need to provide financial support for their families. 
Juveniles who obtain such permission may work no more than 
six hours per day with a one-hour minimum rest period. 
Minors may not work overtime, nor in industries deemed 
hazardous or unhealthy by the Ministry of Health.  These 
regulations do not pertain to employment where the only other 
employees are family members.  The law also prohibits forced 
and compulsory labor.  The law stipulates that the minimum 
age for military recruitment is 18 years. 
 
¶5. (U) Approximately 50 inspectors from the MOL conduct 
inspections of private sector firms relating to health, 
safety and environment (HSE) matters, including monitoring 
child labor violations.  A smaller number of inspectors from 
the Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) also conduct 
inspections with respect to foreign workers' work permits and 
working conditions. 
 
¶6. (U) The GOB does not devote significant resources to 
investigating child labor cases.  The government cites the 
lack of a child labor problem as its cause for not having a 
comprehensive policy to eliminate the worst forms of child 
labor.  Education in Bahrain is free and compulsory in law 
and practice, and widely attended. 
 
¶7. (U) The GOB's 2008 Anti-Trafficking Law stipulates prison 
sentences and fines for trafficking of minors.  Trafficking 
in persons (TIP) and other abuses continue to be a problem 
for many migrant workers in Bahrain, though there were no 
reports of children being trafficked or abused in the 
workplace.
