SUBJECT: IRAQ APPROVES CROATIAN SPECIAL MISSION IN BAGHDAD 
 
¶1. Vesna Klaic, director of the MFA's Eurasia Office, 
confirmed on August 12 that the Government of Iraq has 
approved the GoC's request to open a special mission in 
Baghdad.  This will be the first time Croatia has established 
a special mission, she told PolOff, so it is unclear how long 
it will take to set up or who will staff it.  The Croatian 
Parliament, which is in recess until September 15, must still 
approve creation of the special mission before concrete steps 
can be taken toward opening it, according to Klaic. 
 
 
¶2. COMMENT: The GoC has been interested in opening a mission 
in Baghdad for several months, both to demonstrate its 
support for stability in Iraq and to provide consular 
services to a significant number of Croatian truck drivers 
employed by coalition forces.  END COMMENT.
