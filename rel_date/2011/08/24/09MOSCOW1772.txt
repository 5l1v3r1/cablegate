¶1. (U) This message is sensitive but unclassified, and is not 
meant for Internet distribution. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Per reftel request, Post delivered the demarche on 
DPRK sanctions designations to Russian MFA International 
Organization Department's North Korea action officer Anna 
Yevstegneyeva.  Our British Embassy colleague, having 
received similar instructions to demarche the MFA, joined the 
meeting. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Yevstegneyeva indicated that Foreign Minister 
Lavrov had instructed that a "compromise" be found by the 
July 12 deadline so as to prevent the issue from being 
referred back to the Council.  The MFA, having received last 
week the Russian translation of the joint package of 
designations proposed by the U.S., the U.K., France, and 
Japan, is currently awaiting interagency input on the 
translated documents and hopes to formulate a coordinated 
response by Friday, July 10, which it will pass on in New 
York.  While some Russian agencies have already indicated no 
major problems with the designations, the main export control 
entities responsible for implementing UNSCR 1874 and the 
Ministry of Defense have yet to weigh in.  Yevstegneyeva told 
us that the GOR was likely to propose some adjustments to the 
designations, as there might be duplications in the lists 
contained in the joint package, but regardless would want to 
work out the issue by July 12. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  While reiterating GOR's desire to continue to work 
closely with the Six-Party and Security Council partners 
regarding North Korea, Yevstegneyeva requested that the U.S. 
and allies in the future provide longer than 30 days for the 
consideration of complicated lists.  "When you present us 
with such a lengthy set of documents, you have already had 
the time to formulate your positions, while for us the work 
is just beginning."  The slow nature of the Russian 
bureaucracy, according to her, and the lack of English 
language abilities in the other ministries and agencies, make 
it difficult for the GOR to formulate a speedy response on 
sanctions designations.
