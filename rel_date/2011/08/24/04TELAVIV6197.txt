and "Incursions/Demolitions"). 
 
¶5.  (SBU) INCURSIONS/DEMOLITIONS: 
 
-- UNRWA reported that IDF undercover units, supported 
subsequently by APCs and IAF helicopters, entered the area 
between the Nahal Oz and Karni Crossings just after midnight 
December 7 to search for weapons, according to IDF and 
Israeli media reports.  Militants gathered to repel the 
incursion.  One IDF soldier and his bomb-sniffing dog were 
killed when an IED detonated, and four other soldiers were 
wounded trying to recover the body.  The clashes continued 
throughout the night and into the day, with a total of two 
Palestinians reported killed and at least ten more injured, 
according to UNRWA.  The operation is ongoing as of 1200 
hours. 
 
-- UNRWA reported that three IDF bulldozers and five armored 
vehicles entered eastern al-Qarara (south of the Kissufim 
road, near Khan Yunis) December 5, uprooting 30 dunams of 
olive trees before withdrawing. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) BORDER CROSSINGS: 
 
-- Route Four (Salahadeen Road), the main north-south traffic 
artery, was open December 7, with a major detour at Netzarim 
Junction. 
 
-- Erez Crossing was open for internationals and for a 
limited number of Palestinian merchants December 6-7.  A 
reported 102 merchants crossed into Israel December 6, and 67 
crossed into Israel December 7.  UNRWA reported that 180 
agricultural laborers (married and over age 30) entered

although 70 factory owners were allowed entry to the zone to 
inspect their property December 6, and 69 were allowed entry 
December 7. 
 
-- Sufa Crossing was closed for Palestinian laborers December 
7, but was open for the import of aggregates used in 
construction. 
 
-- Karni Terminal was open but reportedly operating slowly. 
 
-- Rafah Terminal was open for arrivals and departures 
December 7.  Although the IDF no longer prohibits the exit of 
male Palestinians age 16-35 from the Gaza Strip lengthy 
checks at the border mean that few Palestinians in this 
category are actually able to exit.  There are no age 
restrictions for entry into Gaza. 
 
-- Tel al-Sultan checkpoint was closed December 7.  Toufah 
checkpoint was open for residents of al-Mowassi.
