¶1. (SBU) On December 1, Poloff discussed reftel points with 
Theo Kiddess, MFA Deputy Head of Division for Southeast Asia, 
Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific.  Kiddess expressed his 
appreciation for the points, and fully agreed with U.S. views 
on the necessity of a legitimate 2010 election, for dialogue 
between Aung San Suu Kyi and the Government of Burma, and the 
full inclusion of opposition parties and ethnic minorities in 
Burma's political processes. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kiddess highlighted the importance of ASEAN 
countries in putting political pressure on Government of 
Burma (GOB) to seek dialogue with the opposition, and 
stressed that Germany will encourage its ASEAN partners to 
influence the GOB on ref agenda points.  Kiddess stated that 
Germany will continue to support the EU consensus on Burma 
policy and actually fielded a call from the German 
representative in the EU regarding this issue as poloff 
delivered the demarche.
