SUBJECT: RWANDA: 2006 COUNTRY REPORTS ON TERRORISM 
 
REF: STATE 175925 
 
¶1.  (U) Below is Embassy Kigali's submission of the 2006 
Country Report on Terrorism. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Rwandan Government made efforts to combat 
terrorism financing and continued to increase its border 
control measures to identify potential terrorists.  Rwanda 
has an intergovernmental counterterrorism committee and a 
counterterrorism reaction team in the police intelligence 
unit.  Central Bank and Ministry of Finance officials 
continued to provide outstanding cooperation on terrorist 
financing issues.  While the Government of Rwanda (GOR) has 
not yet fully developed its laws and regulations in 
accordance with international anti-terrorism conventions, it 
has the authority under local law to identify, freeze and 
seize terrorist-related financial assets. Rwanda participated 
in regional initiatives on international counterterrorism 
cooperation, including active participation in the East 
African Stand-by Brigade.  In September, it hosted the Third 
Regional Counter-Terrorism Conference for Chiefs of Security 
and Intelligence Services in Kigali, and it assumed the 
Chairmanship of the organization.  In October, Police 
Commissioner General Andrew Rwigamba was appointed as the 
World Regional Chair for sub-Saharan Africa for the 
International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda 
(FDLR, known as the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda, ALIR, 
until 2001) -- an armed ;rebel force, including former 
soldiers and supporters of the previous government that 
orchestrated the 1994  genocide -- continued to operate in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Rwanda pressed for 
international action to pursue the FDLR.  An ALIR unit was 
responsible for the kidnapping and murder of nine persons, 
including two US tourists, in Bwindi Park in 1999.  The 
Rwandan Government assisted US law enforcement officials 
attempting to prosecute three suspects in the attack who were 
transferred to the United States in 2003.  The Rwandan 
Government provided original documents requested by the US 
Justice Department and allowed nine Rwandan officials to 
travel to the United States.
