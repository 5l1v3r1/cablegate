Tunisian newspapers carried July 29 a report of the July 28 
visit to Tunis of Lebanese parliamentary majority leader Saad 
Hariri to meet with Tunisian President Ben Ali.  According to 
AFP press reports, the Tunis stop was part of a tour, 
including Algeria and Morocco, to mobilize support for 
Lebanon during the current crisis.  According to the official 
GOT press release, Hariri asked Ben Ali's support for a 
cease-fire and thanked the Tunisian President for his 
"positions of support for Lebanon, as well as his call for 
Lebanese sovereignty throughout the entirety of the Lebanese 
territory."  Hariri reportedly further thanked Ben Ali for 
Tunisia's humanitarian aid to Lebanon, and asked that the 
President "take advantage of all of Tunisia's international 
contacts to bring necessary pressure on Israel to stop its 
savage aggression against Lebanon."   In his statement 
following his meeting with Ben Ali, Hariri said that Israeli 
aggression was an attempt to demoralize and divide the 
Lebanese people, but defended the will and unity of his 
fellow citizens.
