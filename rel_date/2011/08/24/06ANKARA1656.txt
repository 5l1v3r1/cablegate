¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Senator John Warner led a six-member 
Senate Armed Services Committee delegation to Turkey on Feb. 
23 for meetings with the Parliament (reftel) and Prime 
Minister Erdogan.  (Note: Complete delegation list provided 
at para. 8)  The delegation emphasized the importance of the 
bilateral relationship, welcomed Turkey's support for the 
Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), particularly in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and urged Turkey to consider what more it could 
do for Iraq.  PM Erdogan thanked the USG for its support of 
Turkey's EU candidacy; listed Turkey's continuing concerns in 
Iraq and its contributions to the Coalition effort there; 
expressed frustration at PKK attacks in Turkey emanating from 
northern Iraq and said the Government of Turkey (GOT) still 
expects action against this terrorist group.  Erdogan 
emphasized that an Iraqi referendum on Kirkuk must be 
nationwide and warned that passage of a US Congressional 
resolution on Armenia would negatively impact relations.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
CONTINUED CONCERNS ABOUT IRAQ 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Erdogan opened the meeting by saying that our 
strategic interests and common values would keep the 
bilateral relationship strong and noted Turkey's appreciation 
for the US support of Turkey's EU candidacy.  Highlighting 
the importance of our joint efforts in the war against 
terrorism, Erdogan voiced concern about the increasing 
violence between Iraqi religious and ethnic groups.  For the 
first time, he said, Iraqi political leaders are talking 
about civil war; the threat of civil war could separate the 
country.  Erdogan reiterated Turkey's five long-standing 
desires for Iraq: 1) territorial integrity of the country; 2) 
control of natural resources by the national government; 3) 
no domination of any one religious group over the others; 4) 
no domination of any one ethnic group over the others; 5) 
special status for Kirkuk.  All of these issues, he 
contended, could be protected under the constitution, but 
none of them were reflected in the new constitutional law. 
The Prime Minister described Kirkuk as the critical issue in 
Iraq and stated that any referendum on Kirkuk should be held 
at the national level and monitored by the UN. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Erdogan enumerated Turkey's logistical support 
contributions to the Coalition effort in Iraq since 2005 as 
follows: 
 
- trained 54 Iraqi military officers 
- provided 4 Turkish officials to the NATO Training Mission 
Iraq headquarters 
- permitted 9,323 planes to transit Turkey on the way to Iraq 
- permitted 2,764 logistics flights to deliver supplies to 
Iraq 
- permitted the departure of 780 planes from Turkey to Iraq 
- permitted 862 takers to be refueled 
- provided 270 MW of electricity 
- facilitated the transit of 4,000 trucks and vehicles to 
Iraq through Habur Gate. 
 
Politically, Erdogan said, Turkey has also pressed for full 
participation by all ethnic groups in the various elections 
and invited ethnic leaders to Turkey to meet with US 
Ambassador Khalilzad in a neutral environment.  Senator 
Warner welcomed Turkey's support for the US military in Iraq 
and urged the GOT's continued efforts for an independent, 
democratic Iraq, asking pointedly if there are other ways 
that Turkey can contribute.  He asked for a list in writing 
of Turkey's contributions that could be shared with other 
Senators (Note: which the Prime Ministry subsequently 
provided. End Note.). 
 
¶4. (SBU) Senator Levin thanked Turkey for its current support 
in Iraq and Afghanistan and urged pointed public statements 
on the need for all groups to compromise.  He responded to PM 
Erdogan's concern about a possible civil war by saying that, 
despite initial internal USG disagreement about the Iraq war, 
everyone is now committed to do everything to ensure our 
success.  He agreed that the partition of Iraq would be a 
disaster, not just for Turkey but for the world. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Senators Levin and Salazar echoed Senator Warner in 
asking the Prime Minister if there is more that Turkey can do 
to help.  Erdogan noted that Turkey had done other things, 
including orchestrating nine meetings of Iraq's neighbors to 
coordinate support.  A tenth meeting is being planned, but, 
he agreed, that is not enough.  Turkey's relationship with 
Iraq is special because of familial and tribal ties and it 
can do more.  Senator Salazar called the insurgency a big 
impediment to democracy in Iraq and urged Turkey to fight it 
together with the US.  Senator Bingaman asked Erdogan what 
Turkey knows about Iranian influence in the formation of the 
government, underscoring that this would be of significant 
concern. 
 
STILL LOOKING FOR ACTION AGAINST THE PKK 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Erdogan expressed frustration about the PKK (Kurdish 
Workers' Party) terrorists who conduct attacks against Turkey 
from camps in northern Iraq.  Many European countries and the 
US have labeled the PKK a terrorist organization, but no 
action has been taken against them, he said.  They have 
impunity in northern Iraq and turn national Turkish holidays 
into "bloody days."  Erdogan ended by stating that Turkey 
still expects action against the PKK.  Senator Warner agreed 
that fighting terrorism is not the responsibility of any one 
country, but is a shared international responsibility. 
Senator Levin added that the PKK problem will be worse if 
Iraq is divided.  Quoting the US military, he said there can 
be no military solution without a political solution.  To get 
there, all parties must be persuaded. 
 
NO "SUMMARY EXECUTION" ON ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Erdogan stated flatly that an Armenian Genocide 
resolution "will impact our relationship." In his view, 
Armenians have yet to recognize Turkey's "goodwill".  Turkey 
has opened it archives and invited third countries and 
Armenia to do the same so that policy specialists, 
archeologists, historians and others could study the issue 
together, but Armenia never responded to the invitation. 
Lobbying activities, said Erdogan, don't help, and Turkey 
will not accept a "summary execution" on this issue.  He 
stated his belief that the US Senate would continue to 
demonstrate sensitivity on this issue.  Senator Warner 
responded that there are two sides to every story but agreed 
that history will be the judge.  Warner said that, for his 
part, he focused his efforts on the men and women fighting 
today.
