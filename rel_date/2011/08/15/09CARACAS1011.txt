Classified By: A/POLITICAL COUNSELOR DARNALL STEUART, REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D).

¶1. (SBU) An estimated 35 armed militants attacked the opposition-leaning television station Globovision in the early afternoon of August 3, 2009, led by the well-known pro-Chavez activist Lina Ron. Brandishing weapons, the attackers breached the perimeter wall of the station's headquarters. After throwing multiple tear gas grenades the group left on motorcycles. Two Globovision employees and a policewoman are reported to be injured. Director of Globovision Alberto Ravell gave a public statement placing the responsibility for the attack squarely with President Hugo Chavez. Minister of Interior and Justice Tareck El Aissami said shortly after the tear-gassing that the Government of the BolivarianRepublic of Venezuela (GBRV) "condemns the violent actions" taken against the station.

¶2. (C) Comment: This physical attack is the latest intimidation of Globovision, the last remaining opposition-leaning television channel with any free-to-air broadcasting (ref A). The attack follows the weekend closure of 32 radio and 2 television stations (see septel). President Chavez's dislike of the station is public knowledge; he was reportedly very unhappy that Secretary of State Clinton gave an interview to the station. He has publicly called on his cabinet to find a way to close the channel down. Lina Ron is a well-known pro-Chavez militant and media foil who has claimed responsibility for attacks on opposition leaders before (ref B and C), and is frequently a voice for radical action against "enemies of the revolution." While she has sometimes been disavowed and chastised by the GBRV, she has not faced any criminal charges. This brazen day-light attack is indicative of the current precarious status of independent media in Venezuela and the tensions that exist between the media and pro-government groups.
