SUBJECT: COMBATTING VENEZUELAN DIVERSION OF ARMS TO THE FARC

REF: A. STATE 83014
¶B. AUGUST 9 MORATINOS-S LETTER
¶C. STATE 82937

Classified By: Charge D'Affaires William H. Duncan 1.4 (b) and (d)

¶1. (C) Reftel points were conveyed August 14 to Spanish MFA
Deputy Director General for Andean Affairs Javier Triana
Jimenez (Triana served as Spanish Deputy Chief of Mission in
Caracas from 2002 to 2006.). Triana said the Colombian
government had asked FM Moratinos to raise with the GOV the
diversion of anti-air missiles and Swedish-manufactured
rocket launchers to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC). He accepted as fact that arms seized by
Colombian forces in July had come from Venezuela but was
reluctant to concede the seizures demonstrated clear GOV
support for the FARC. Triana said that "at his level" he was
unaware of proven links and official participation. Triana
said he could think of other possible (albeit "very
improbable") explanations. He acknowledged evidence from the
Reyes laptops pointed in that direction of GOV involvement.
Nonetheless, he stressed the need for proof of high-level GOV
complicity in arms transfers to the FARC. With regard to
additional post-sale controls, Triana cautioned that short of
"forcing an embargo," Europeans must analyze each potential
sale carefully and acknowledge that neither the GOS nor the
USG can control all arms exports to Venezuela. Triana asked
rhetorically whether in restricting legitimate sales to
Venezuela from countries that had post-shipment controls in
place we did not risk even more limited accountability for
transactions from less reliable partners.

¶2. (C) In response to the suggestion that Spain's upcoming
January-June 2010 EU Presidency was an opportunity to raise
awareness and strengthen controls, Triana expressed doubt
about how much Spain could accomplish during its EU
presidency and could not envision any specific additional
measures Spain would institute beyond the existing protocols.
Although Triana's counterparts in the MFA arms control and
Russia offices were unavailable during the August vacation
period, Triana said he would share the points with other
interested bureaus to ensure broad consideration of our
views. While Triana discounted analysis directly linking the
GOV with arms transfers to the FARC, he referenced FM
Moratinos's travel to the region and subsequent August 9
letter (reftel B) as a demonstration of Spanish willingness
to support the United States and Colombia. Post will
continue to press our case that Spain should review current
export controls to ensure sufficient transparency and
accountability measures.
