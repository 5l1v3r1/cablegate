REF: STATE 198912 
 
-------- 
OVERVIEW 
-------- 
 
¶1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY A/DCM SCOTT MARCIEL FOR REASONS: 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
¶2.  (U) FIGHTING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM HAS LONG BEEN A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY (GOT). SINCE THE MID-1960S, TURKEY HAS FACED ALMOST A CONSTANT THREAT FROM DOMESTIC AND TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM TARGETED AGAINST BOTH TURKS AND FOREIGNERS, INCLUDING USG PERSONNEL. TERRORIST GROUPS OPERATING IN TURKEY INCLUDE MARXIST-LENINIST, RADICAL ISLAMIST, SEPARATIST, AND PRO-CHECHEN. MOST OF THESE GROUPS OPERATE TRANSNATIONALLY ASWELL. IN LIGHT OF THIS THREAT, THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY HAS DEVELOPED BOTH THE WILL AND CAPABILITY TO FIGHT TERRORISM AND HAS CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED THE USG'S INTERNATIONAL, COORDINATED EFFORT. TURKEY'S HARD-LINE AGAINST TERRORISM WAS SUPREMELY MANIFESTED IN ITS EARLY AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THE US-LED COALITION IN OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF), BOTH THROUGH PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND CONCRETE ACTIONS. (PARAS. 13, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23) 
 
U.S. DESIGNATED TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS 
 
¶3. (U) ON OCTOBER 8, 1997, THE SECRETARY OF STATE NAMED THE SEPARATIST KURDISTAN WORKERS' PARTY (PKK) AND THE 
MARXIST-LENINIST REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S PARTY/FRONT (DHKP/C, FORMERLY KNOWN AS REVOLUTIONARY LEFT (DEV-SOL), MAKING THEM SUBJECT TO THE ANTITERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT OF 1996.  ON OCTOBER 11, 2001 THE SECRETARY OF STATE RENEWED THOSE DESIGNATIONS. 
 
MARXIST-LENINIST 
 
¶4. (U) THE MAIN RADICAL-LEFT TERROR ORGANIZATION, DHKP-C, 
CONDUCTS SMALL-SCALE OPERATIONS AGAINST TURKS AND FOREIGNERS ALIKE (ARMED ATTACKS ON UNIFORMED POLICE, SUICIDE AND OTHER BOMBINGS, ASSASSINATIONS). TWO DHKP/C SUICIDE BOMBERS IN JANUARY AND SEPTEMBER KILLED 3 POLICEMAN AND AN AUSTRALIAN TOURIST AND WOUNDED SCORES OF BYSTANDERS. A SEPTEMBER 28 
PIPEBOMB ATTACK ON A MCDONALD'S IN ISTANBUL APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT BY RADICAL LEFTISTS, THOUGH NO GROUP HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACT. OTHER FAR-LEFT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS STILL ACTIVE INCLUDE THE TURKISH COMMUNIST PARTY/MARXIST-LENINIST (TKP/ML)  AND THE TURKISH WORKERS' AND PEASANTS LIBERATION ARMY (TIKKO). OF THE TWO ONLY TIKKO STILL CARRIES OUT OPERATIONS WITH ANY LEVEL OF FREQUENCY, AND THEN 
USUALLY IN CERTAIN PARTS OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN ANATOLIA. 
 
RADICAL ISLAMIST 
 
¶5. (U)  IN TERMS OF CAPABILITIES AND FOLLOWERS, THE 
FUNDAMENTALIST "TURKISH HIZBULLAH" POSES THE GREATEST THREAT OF ALL RADICAL ISLAMIST GROUPS IN TURKEY. IT STAGED A SPECTACULAR JANUARY 2001 AMBUSH IN DIYARBAKIR THAT TOOK THE LIFE OF DIYARBAKIR SECURITY DIRECTOR GAFFAR OKKAN AND FIVE OF HIS BODYGUARDS. TWO UNDERCOVER POLICE WERE KILLED IN ANOTHER HIZBULLAH ATTACK IN OCTOBER 2001. HIZBULLAH HAD PREVIOUSLY 
SHUNNED CONFRONTATION WITH AUTHORITIES IN FAVOR OF BATTLING RIVALS, LARGELY THE PKK AND ANOTHER RIVAL ISLAMIST FACTION. BEFORE THE OKKAN ASSASSINATION, MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVED THE GROUP HAD BEEN RENDERED INCAPABLE OF STAGING A SERIOUS TERRORIST ASSAULT AFTER POLICE RAIDED AN ISTANBUL SAFEHOUSE IN JANUARY 2000, KILLING THE RIGIDLY CENTRALIZED GROUP'S LEADER AND SEIZING PILES OF DOCUMENTS THAT LED TO THOUSANDS OF DETENTIONS. OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS INCLUDE THE GREAT 
EASTERN RAIDER'S FRONT (IBDA-C), FEDERAL ISLAMIC STATE OF 
ANATOLIA (KAPLANCILAR), SELAM GROUP, ISLAMIC MOVEMENT 
ORGANIZATION (IHO), AND THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS. 
 
SEPARATIST 
 
¶6. (U) THE PKK REPRESENTS THE LARGEST SEPARATIST TERRORIST GROUP IN TURKEY, THOUGH ITS CAPABILITY TO OPERATE HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY REDUCED THANKS TO VIGOROUS AND ON-GOING COUNTER-INSURGENCY EFFORTS OF THE TURKISH ARMED FORCES, JANDARMA, TURKISH NATIONAL POLICE (TNP), AND VILLAGE GUARDS (A PARAMILITARY GUARD FORCE RECRUITED FROM LOCAL VILLAGERS). THIS EFFORT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE ARREST AND CONVICTION OF THE PKK LEADER ABDULLAH OCALAN IN 1999. WITH ITS LEADER 
INCARCERATED IN IMRALI PRISON NEAR ISTANBUL, THE PKK NOW LARGELY ABIDES BY A SEPTEMBER 1, 1999 SELF-PROCLAIMED CEASEFIRE. SMALL PKK COMBAT FORMATIONS, ESTIMATED BY THE TURKISH MILITARY AT BETWEEN 300-500, STILL OPERATE, THOUGH LARGELY IN NORTHERN IRAQ AND AT A DRASTICALLY REDUCED LEVEL FROM THE HEIGHT OF THE CONFLICT IN 1992-94. SMALL CELLS AND SYMPATHIZERS REMAIN THROUGHOUT TURKEY, BUT THESE HAVE BEEN 
SUPPRESSED TO THE POINT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, RATHER THAN THE MILITARY, OVERSEE MOST OPERATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS. FOUR PROVINCES (DOWN FROM A HIGH OF ELEVEN) STILL REMAIN UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY DECREE, WHICH IS RENEWED BY PARLIAMENT EVERY FOUR MONTHS AND WAS LAST EXTENDED IN NOVEMBER 2001. INCREASED CALM AND SECURITY IN THE SOUTHEAST SINCE 1999 HAS ENABLED, ACCORDING TO STATE AUTHORITIES, 18,000 INTERNALLY DISPLACED PERSONS TO RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGES. 
 
PRO-CHECHEN TERRORISM 
 
¶7.  (U) A GROUP OF 13 PRO-CHECHEN TURKISH CITIZENS SEIZED THE SWISS HOTEL IN ISTANBUL ON APRIL 22, 2001 AND HELD 150 
HOSTAGES, INCLUDING 37 AMERICAN CITIZENS, FOR APPROXIMATELY 12 HOURS UNTIL THEY SURRENDERED WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE TERROR GROUP STAGED THE RAID TO PROTEST RUSSIAN ACTIONS IN CHECHNYA. THEY ARE PRESENTLY IN CUSTODY AND ON TRIAL IN ISTANBUL STATE 
SECURITY COURT UNDER A VARIETY OF CHARGES, THOUGH NOT UNDER TURKEY'S TOUGH ANTI-TERROR LAW. THE LEADER OF THE HOSTAGE TAKERS, MUHAMMED TOKCAN, MASTERMINDED THE 1996 SEIZURE OF THE FERRY BOAT AVRASYA. HE ESCAPED FROM PRISON AFTER BEING 
CONVICTED FOR THE INCIDENT, THOUGH AGAIN NOT UNDER THE ANTI-TERROR LAW. LARGE NUMBERS OF TURKS, MANY WITH ROOTS IN THE CAUCASUS, ARE SYMPATHETIC TO CHECHEN AMBITIOUS. 
 
¶8. (U) THE CAPITALIZED TITLES BELOW CORRESPOND TO REFTEL 
QUESTIONS. 
 
----------------------------------- 
RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM (C) 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) STATE SECURITY COURTS (DGM) IN EIGHT PROVINCES, WITH JURISDICTION FOR ALL CRIMES THAT FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE ANTI-TERROR LAW, TAKE A VIGOROUS APPROACH TOWARDS PROSECUTING TERROR-RELATED CRIMES. APPROXIMATELY 2,400 TERROR CASES CAME BEFORE STATE SECURITY COURTS IN 2001. AGGRESSIVE PROSECUTION OF SUSPECTED HIZBULLAH MEMBERS CONTINUES, WITH 
MULTIPLE ON-GOING INVESTIGATIONS AND TRIALS. AVERAGE TRIAL TIMES RUN MORE THAN A YEAR, AND DEFENDANTS ARE USUALLY INCARCERATED DURING THEIR TRIALS. APPROXIMATELY 2000 HIZBULLAH MEMBERS ARE PRESENTLY DETAINED OR IN PRISON. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 8,600 INDIVIDUALS PRESENTLY SERVING SENTENCES FOR TERROR CRIMES. 
 
¶10. (U) OPENED IN JULY 2000 IN DIYARBAKIR STATE SECURITY 
COURT, THE MAIN HIZBULLAH TRIAL CONTINUES. TWENTY 
INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING TWO TOP HIZBULLAH LEADERS, ARE CHARGED WITH 156 MURDERS. THE TRIAL OF 17 JERUSALEM WARRIORS SUSPECTS, CHARGED WITH 22 MURDERS OF PROMINENT SECULAR INTELLECTUALS AND JOURNALISTS, FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, AND USAF SSGT VICTOR MARVIK, IS ALSO ON-GOING. ABDULLAH OCALAN, THE LEADER OF THE PKK CONVICTED OF TREASON IN JUNE 1999 AND SENTENCED TO DEATH, APPEALED TO THE EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS (ECHR). IN JANUARY 2000, PRIME MINISTER BULENT ECEVIT DECIDED NOT TO SUBMIT OCALAN'S DEATH SENTENCE TO THE PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL, PENDING A FINAL ECHR DECISION. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS (D/E) 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶11. (U) IN 2001, THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY DID NOT SEEK THE 
EXTRADITION OF ANY SUSPECTS FROM THE UNITED STATES ON 
TERROR-RELATED CHARGES, NOR DID THE UNITED STATES SEEK THE EXTRADITION OF SUCH SUSPECTS FROM TURKEY. IN THE PAST, TURKEY HAS FACED DIFFICULTY IN EXTRADITING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. SYRIA, IRAQ, AND IRAN HAVE LONG HARBORED PKK TERRORISTS WHICH THEY HAVE USED AGAINST TURKEY. EUROPEAN STATES HAVE ALSO BEEN HESITANT TO EXTRADITE TERROR-SUSPECTS TO TURKEY. DESPITE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON TERRORISM, SYMPATHY WITH KURDISH POLITICAL AND CULTURAL ASPIRATIONS IN SOME EUROPEAN STATES, ALLEGATIONS OF TORTURE BY TURKISH OFFICIALS, AND TURKEY'S LEGAL PROVISION FOR THE DEATH PENALTY HAVE ALL PROVED IMPEDIMENTS TO SUCH EXTRADITIONS. HOWEVER, NO EXECUTIONS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN 
TURKEY SINCE 1984 DESPITE THE FACT THAT SCORES OF CONVICTED TERRORISTS, INCLUDING PKK LEADER ABDULLAH OCALAN, HAVE RECEIVED DEATH SENTENCES. 
 
¶12. (U) MOST RECENTLY, BELGIUM HAS REFUSED TO EXTRADITE FERYA ERDAL, A MEMBER OF DHKP/C ACCUSED IN THE JANUARY 1996 SLAYING OF PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN OZDEMIR SABANCI AND TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS. THE BELGIAN GOVERNMENT CITED TURKEY'S LEGAL PROVISION FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT AS GROUNDS FOR REFUSING EXTRADITION, EVEN THOUGH TURKEY PROMISED NOT TO EXECUTE HER IF SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY. ERDAL WAS PLACED UNDER HOUSE ARREST 
IN BELGIUM AND INITIALLY CHARGED WITH MINOR WEAPONS 
VIOLATIONS. IN 2001, HOWEVER, CITING THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON TERRORISM, A BRUSSELS COURT RULED THAT ERDAL COULD BE TRIED FOR MURDER UNDER BELGIAN LAW. THE TURKISH MINISTER OF JUSTICE WELCOMED THE RULING AS A "POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT." ERDAL'S LAWYERS HAVE APPEALED. 
 
------------------------------------ 
RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION (F) 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶13. (U)  PRESIDENT SEZER, PRME MINISTER ECEVIT, FOREIGN 
MINISTER CEM, AND CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF HUSEYIN 
KIVRIKOGLU HAVE REPEATEDLY AND STRONGLY DENOUNCED TERRORISM DURING 2001. THESE STATEMENTS ONLY INCREASED IN VOLUME AND IMPORTANCE IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS. ON SEPTEMBER 12, PRIME MINISTER ECEVIT, ON LIVE TELEVISION, STATED FIRMLY THAT TURKEY "WAS AT THE SIDE OF THE UNITED STATES". 
 
¶14. (U) AFTER THE APRIL 22 SEIZURE OF THE SWISS HOTEL, WHERE PRO-CHECHEN TURKISH MILITANTS HELD 150 HOSTAGES, INCLUDING 37 AMERICAN CITIZENS, FOR 12 HOURS, THEN INTERIOR MINISTER TANTAN AND THE ISTANBUL SECURITY DIRECTOR MADE STATEMENTS THAT IMPLIED THAT THE INCIDENT WAS NOT AN ACT OF TERROR. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS BY THE GOT (G) 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶15. (U)  ON ALL FRONTS, THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY CONTINUED AGGRESSIVE COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS IN 2001. THE POLICE CONTINUED THEIR RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF HIZBULLAH AFTER THE JANUARY ASSASSINATION OF DIYARBAKIR SECURITY DIRECTOR GAFFAR OKKAN, CONDUCTING OVER 553 OPERATIONS THAT LED TO 1313 
DETENTIONS THROUGH NOVEMBER. SULHADIN URUK, A LEADING HIZBULLAH MILITANT, WAS KILLED IN A SEPTEMBER RAID. A DECEMBER OPERATION NETTED SUSPECTS IMPLICATED IN THE 1993 SLAYING OF DEMOCRACY PARTY DEPUTY MEHMET SINCAR, THE KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF ISLAMIST FEMINIST KONCA KURIS, AND THE OCTOBER 2001 ASSASSINATION OF TWO POLICE OFFICERS.  THE GOT CONTINUES ITS ACTIVE SUPPRESSION OF THE PKK, THOUGH ITS SECURITY OPERATIONS TEMPO HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN LINE WITH A REDUCTION IN THE CONFLICT. 
 
¶16. (U) POLICE HAVE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY WORKED TO DISRUPT AND UNCOVER DHKP/C CELLS. IN ADDITION, THE DECEMBER 2000 "OPERATION RETURN TO LIFE" HAS REPORTEDLY GREATLY REDUCED THE GROUP'S OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES.  THAT OPERATION SMASHED DHKP-C CONTROL IN LARGE, WARD-STYLE DETENTION FACILITIES AND TRANSFERRED ITS MEMBERS TO SMALL-CELL, "F-TYPE" PRISONS. DHKP-C HAD PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED OPERATIONS AND TRAINING FROM PRISONS WHERE AUTHORITIES HAD EFFECTIVELY LOST CONTROL. IN PROTEST OF THE "F-TYPE" PRISONS, DHKP/C SYMPATHIZERS AND SUPPORTERS HAVE CONDUCTED HUNGER STRIKES IN WHICH 41 INDIVIDUALS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES.  A STATE FORENSIC AUTOPSY REPORT RELEASED AFTER THE RAID INDICATED THAT SOME OF THE 31 
DEATHS IN THE OPERATION MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM THE  USE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE. 
 
------------------------------------ 
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM (H) 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶17. (U) THE GOT CONSISTENTLY AND STRONGLY OPPOSES BOTH 
DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. TURKEY DOES NOT VIEW ITS MAINTENANCE OF DIPLOMATIC OR ECONOMIC/COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH CUBA, IRAN, IRAQ, LIBYA, SUDAN, AND SYRIA AS CONSTITUTING SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
SUPPORT STATEMENTS FOR TERRORIST COUNTRIES (I) 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶18. (U) THE GOT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 2000 IN SUPPORT OF TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES ON TERRORISM ISSUES. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDES TOWARDS TERRORISM (J) 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶19. (U) THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 HARDENED GOT DETERMINATION TO FIGHT TERRORISM, BOTH INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC. THIS HEIGHTENED WILL WAS MANIFESTED IN BOTH CONTINUING EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS DOMESTIC TERROR GROUPS, ESPECIALLY HIZBULLAH, AND IN STRONG SUPPORT--BOTH IN WORD AND DEED--OF OPERATION ENDURING 
FREEDOM. IN THE WAKE OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBINGS, THE GOT HAS STEPPED UP PRESSURE FOR THE EU TO ADOPT TOUGHER MEASURES AGAINST TURKISH TERROR GROUPS OPERATING IN EUROPE, NAMELY DHKP/C, PKK, HIZBULLAH, AND THE KAPLANCILAR. ON DECEMBER 12, THE GOVERNMENT OF GERMANY OUTLAWED THE KAPLANCILAR ORGANIZATION. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
USG COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND INITIATIVE WITH GOT (K) 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 

¶20. (U) TURKISH SUPPORT IN THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER 11 
UNDERSCORED THE GOT'S COMMITTED POLICY ON FIGHTING TERROR, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL. IN THE FACE OF STRONG PUBLIC OPPOSITION, PARLIAMENT, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PM ECEVIT, PASSED A RESOLUTION ALLOWING THE GOVERNMENT TO SEND TURKISH TROOPS ABROAD AND TO PERMIT THE STATIONING OF FOREIGN TROOPS ON TURKISH SOIL TO SUPPORT OEF. AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE RESOLUTION, TURKEY OFFERED A 90-MAN SPECIAL OPERATIONS UNIT FOR DUTY IN AFGHANISTAN.  IN GENERAL, BUT ESPECIALLY AFTER 
SEPTEMBER 11, THE TURKISH NATIONAL POLICE (TNP) HAS CONTINUED TO PROVIDED EXCELLENT PROTECTION OF US DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY FACILITIES THROUGHOUT TURKEY. 
 
¶21. (U) IN RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ASKING FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE TERRORIST-RELATED FINANCIAL ASSETS, THE GOT FORMED AN INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP TO COORDINATE INVESTIGATIONS AND TO FREEZE FINANCIAL ASSETS. 
THIS EFFORT HAS RESULTED SO FAR IN FREEZING ABOUT USD 2 
MILLION IN FINANCIAL ASSETS IN TURKEY OWNED BY AN INDIVIDUAL ON THE EXECUTIVE ORDER (NO. 13224) LIST OF TERRORIST FINANCIERS. THE GOT IS REVIEWING THE POSSIBILITY OF AMENDING THE LEGAL PROCESS FOR FREEZING FINANCIAL ASSETS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE QUICK REACTION TO NEW INFORMATION. 
 
(INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX) 
 
¶22. (S)  THE TURKISH MILITARY  HAS ALSO OFFERED THE USE OF AN ADDITIONAL AIRBASE TO LIGHTEN THE LOAD ON INCIRLIK AFB AND EASED FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS TO EASE US SUPPORT OF FORCES OPERATING IN AFGHANISTAN. OTHER TURKISH ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF OEF INCLUDE: 
 
--OFFERED TWO KC-135 REFUELING TANKERS; 
--CSAR IN TU/ONV INTELLIGENCE SUPPORT AND MEDICAL SUPPORT PLANNING; 
--AGREE TO STRIP ESM UNITS FROM NEW HELICOPTERS FOR USE BY US FORCES; 
--BLANKET OVERFLIGHT AND LANDING FOR ALL AMC A/C (CLEARANCEINCLUDES A/C AND HAZMAT AT ZERO LEAD TIME AND MINIMUM NOTIFICATION WHERE ESSENTIAL); 
--USE OF AIRBASES TO INCLUDE: FUEL, LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AND SUPPLY, STATIONING AIRCRAFT CREW AND NECESSARY EQUIPMENT; 
--4 LNOS AT CENTCOM, 1 AT EUCOM, 1 IN AFGHANISTAN; 
--FULLY COMPLIANT: WASSENAAR, AUSTRALIA GROUPS, MISSILE 
TECHNOLOGY AND CONTROL, NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS GROUP, 
NONPROLIFERATION REGIMES; 
--AUTHORIZED THE DELIVERY OF LETHAL MUNITIONS (ALONG WITH FOOD AND BLANKETS) TO THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE OUT OF INCIRLIK AFB. 
 
¶23. (S) IN GENERAL, TURKEY HAS BEEN COOPERATIVE IN 
WATCHLISTING, ARRESTING, DETAINING, QUESTIONING, AND 
DISRUPTING SOME SUSPECTED TERRORISTS ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES. THE GOT HAS ALSO PROVED HELPFUL IN TRACING AND TRACKING INDIVIDUALS BELIEVED TO HAVE LINKS TO THE AL-QA'IDA ORGANIZATION. BESIDES ASSISTING WITH SUSPECTED TERRORISTS LOCATED IN TURKEY, ANKARA HAS ALSO BEEN COOPERATIVE IN ASSISTING THE USG IN ITS REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN MAKING SMOOTH THE TRANSITING OF TERRORISTS THROUGH TURKEY FOR 
RENDITION TO OTHER COUNTRIES. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
COOPERATION-INVESTIGATION/PROSECUTION (L) 
----------------------------------------- 
 
(INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX) 
 
¶24. (C) THE MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND TURKEY, WHICH ENTERED INTO FORCE IN JANUARY 1981, GOVERNS INVESTIGATIVE COOPERATION. THE GOT HAS EXPEDITIOUSLY PROCESSED REQUESTS FOR INVESTIGATIVE ACCESS TO EVIDENCE UNDER THIS TREATY. HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES THE GOT HAS LEFT REQUESTS 
UNANSWERED FOR OVER THREE YEARS. IN 2001, THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SUCCESSFULLY FORWARDED AN MLAT REQUEST TO INTERVIEW A SUSPECTED MEMBER OF THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS, AN ISLAMIST TERROR GROUP. 
 
¶25. (U) OVERALL, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, THE GOT HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE USG IN THE APPREHENSION, CONVICTION, AND PUNISHMENT OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS IN TURKEY. THE MOST PROMINENT EXAMPLE OF THE GOT'S AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS TO BRING TERRORISTS TO JUSTICE CONTINUES TO BE THE SEPTEMBER 2000 ARREST OF FOUR SUSPECTS INDICTED IN THE 1991 
ASSASSINATION OF USAF SSGT VICTOR MARVICK IN ANKARA. THE TRIAL OF THE FOUR , WHO ARE ALLEGEDLY MEMBERS OF THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS, IS CONTINUING. 
 
-------------------------- 
COOPERATION-PREVENTION (M) 
-------------------------- 
 
(INFORMATION FOR THE REPORT'S CLASSIFIED ANNEX) 
 
¶26. (C) PURSUANT TO AN MLAT REQUEST, IN SEPTEMBER 2001 RSO AND LEGAT INTERVIEWED RUSTU AYTUFAN, AN ALLEGED MEMBER OF THE JERUSALEM WARRIORS, REGARDING HIS  CONFESSION TO THE TNP THAT HE AND ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL CONDUCTED PRE-OPERATIONAL SURVEILLANCE OF US EMBASSY EMPLOYEES AND OF THE US EMBASSY COMPOUND IN 1999. ON HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEY'S ADVICE, HOWEVER, 
AYTUFAN REFUSED TO GRANT AN INTERVIEW FOR FEAR THAT HIS STATEMENTS COULD BE USED AGAINST HIM IN A PENDING TRIAL FOR SEVERAL POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED KILLINGS, INCLUDING THAT OF SSGT MARVICK. EMBASSY ANKARA REMAINS CONFIDENT THAT ONGOING COOPERATION BETWEEN THE DOJ AND THE TURKISH MINISTRY OF JUSTICE WILL YIELD ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVIEW THE SUSPECT AT THE END OF THE TRIAL.
