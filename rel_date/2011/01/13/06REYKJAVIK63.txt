SUBJECT:  ICELAND JOINS EU IN CONDEMNATION OF IRAQ 
SHRINE BOMBING 
 
REF:  STATE 28802 
 
(SBU) Post discussed the Al-Askariya shrine bombing 
with Icelandic MFA International Institutions Division 
Director (and Middle East desk officer) Nikulas 
Hannigan February 24.  Hannigan informed us that 
Iceland had a day earlier associated itself with a 
draft declaration by the European Union Presidency 
condemning the bombing.  Iceland would not issue a 
separate statement from that of the EU, Hannigan said, 
but would take our demarche into account when 
considering additional possible responses to the 
incident.
