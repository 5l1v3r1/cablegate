REF: STATE 25689 AND PREVIOUS (NOTAL)

Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Aubrey Carlson. Reasons 1.4 (b), (d) and (h).

¶1. (S) Stressing the long history and continuing nature of PRC company LIMMTs Iran missile-related proliferation activities, PolOff delivered reftel demarche urging the Chinese government to investigate and prevent LIMMTs proliferation behavior to MFA Arms Control and Disarmament Department Missile and Conventional Weapons Division Deputy Director Sun Lei on March 20.

¶2. (S) Sun asked if the items sold by LIMMT to Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group were specifically controlled by relevant nonproliferation regimes. PolOff replied affirmatively and highlighted the potential supply of the 3GFF-700 cold flow forming machine controlled by the MTCR, NSG and Wassenaar arrangement, and also stressed that UN Security Council Resolution 1737 required States to prevent the transfer of any item that would contribute to the development of a nuclear weapon delivery system. Sun said China would "take necessary measures concerning the information."

¶3. (C) In response to PolOffs mention of current sanctions on LIMMT, Sun said that while China looks forward to future cooperation with the United States on nonproliferation, sanctions were not conducive to the whole atmosphere and were "not the proper way to solve these issues." Sun repeated past requests for more details and specifics on cases of proliferation concern in order to help China investigate.

¶4. (SBU) Sun mentioned to PolOff that the MFA Arms Control and Disarmament Department would be going through a "restructuring" in the coming two months. Responsibility for individual cases of nonproliferation concern would be transferred from the Missile and Conventional Weapons (Third) Division "to a newly reorganized Second Division." Sun said further details "would be shared soon." PICCUTA
