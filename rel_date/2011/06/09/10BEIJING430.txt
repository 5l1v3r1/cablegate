REF: STATE 9939

Classified By: Regional Unit Chief Mark Lambert. Reason 1.4 C.

(S) PolOff passed reftel nonpaper providing information about a December 2009 offer by Chinese company Hong Kong 4 Star Electronics Ltd. to sell gyroscopes produced by a Russian company to Irans Isfahan Optics Industries to MFA Arms Control and Disarmament Department Nuclear Division Deputy Director Zhang Shen on February 23. Zhang noted that proliferation cases were handled within a different Division within the Arms Control and Disarmament Department but agreed to pass the nonpaper to relevant colleagues. (Note: Since the January 30 announcement of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, officials from the MFA Arms Control and Disarmament Department Chem/Bio Division, who normally receive all demarches regarding proliferation activities by companies within China, are currently placing all demarche requests "under consideration," thereby requiring post to find other means to deliver these demarches.)
