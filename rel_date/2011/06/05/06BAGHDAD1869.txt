SUBJECT: PM HOPES TO COMPLETE SELECTION OF SECURITY 
MINISTERS SOON; DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT BASRAH 

REF: BAGHDAD 1845 

Classified By: AMBASSADOR ZALMAY KHALILZAD PER 1.4 B AND D. 

¶1. (C) SUMMARY: In a June 1 meeting with Ambassador, PM 
Maliki repeated his intent to complete selection soon of 
Ministers of Defense and Interior. MinDef will be either 
Abdel Qader al-Mufraji (if Kurds can be brought on board) or 
Nabil Khalil Saeed. MinInt candidates are Tawfiq Yasseri or 
Farouk al-Araji. PM returned from Basrah deeply concerned 
about security and economic deterioration but energized about 
addressing Basrah's problems quickly. PM's views on new U.S. 
position on talking to Iran, need for GOI approach to UNSC on 
UNSCR 1637 reported septels. END SUMMARY.

Visit to Basrah Deeply Troubling 
-------------------------------- 

¶2. (C) In a June 1 meeting, Ambassador commended PM Maliki 
for his visit to Basrah the previous day and the positive 
impact of his "iron fist" public remarks. Maliki, who several 
times during the meeting noted his "deep, deep concern" about 
the situation in Basrah, cited the long list of urgent 
problems: violent tribal and political rivalries; totally 
dysfunctional and compromised police force; mafia-like gangs 
menacing the city; probable nefarious foreign involvement; 
and overall collapse of the infrastructure. In his 
discussions with Basrah leaders, Maliki said that he heard 
complaints about British forces, including allegations they 
are assassinating people - which the PM said he already has 
discussed with the UK Ambassador. 

¶3. (C) When Ambassador asked what he needs from the U.S., 
Maliki said that he needs an urgent security plan and 
resources for reconstruction. Maliki explained that he 
established an emergency security committee in Basrah. 
(NOTE: In a separate meeting, VP Tariq al-Hashemi identified 
members of the committee: the Governor, Badr Corps head Hadi 
al-Amri, former Minister of Transportation Salah Maliki, 
Minister of Provincial Affairs Saad Taher al-Hashemi, and an 
unidentified Tawafuq representative. END NOTE.) Maliki said 
that the Iraqi Army is respected by the people of Basrah and 
that, as of June 1, they would be manning the city's 
checkpoints. Although Maliki has asked the Basrah emergency 
committee to devise a security plan, he accepted the 
Ambassador's suggestion that MNF-I CG Casey return the next 
day for further discussion on security requirements. 

¶4. (C) The PM also said that the people of Basrah need to see 
some improvement in their infrastructure. The University is 
a disaster; they have limited electricity and no drinkable 
water; and they need a bridge over the Shatt al-Arab, Maliki 
said. Ambassador promised to return in a few days with ideas 
for projects that might be undertaken in Basrah, but noted 
that the security situation makes reconstruction projects 
problematic. The PM insisted that the people of Basrah are 
ready for change, and if he loses Basrah, he said he fears 
that other Iraqi cities could also collapse. The number of 
trained Iraqi forces are inadequate for the task, Maliki 
said, and he needs to increase their number quickly. Of the 
15,000 policemen, only 3000 are real - the other are paper 
policemen.

On Track to Name MOI/MOD 
------------------------ 

¶5. (S) Ambassador told the PM that the U.S. is comfortable 
with either Adbel Qader Al-Mufraji or Nabil Khalil Saeed as 
MinDef. Ambassador said he is sending a message to Masud 
Barzani on Abdel Qader and, if necessary, would go in person 
to see him (Barzani). Likewise, Ambassador added, the U.S. 
believes that Tawfiq Yasseri or Farouq al-Araji are 
acceptable candidates for MinInt, although Yasseri is the 
stronger of the two. The PM said accepted this and asked for 
results of the outreach to Barzani as soon as possible.
