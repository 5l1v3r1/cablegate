¶1.  (U) Summary: Fulfilling his promise to replace deceased 
MinDef Guadalupe Larriva (RefTel) with a female civilian from 
the southern highland city of Cuenca, President Correa on 
January 30 named Lorena Escudero as the new Minister of 
Defense.  Escudero, who assumed control of the Ministry of 
Defense on February 2, is an academic with little government 
experience and even less defense training.  Before handing 
control of the military over to Escudero, Acting MinDef 
Ricardo Patino on February 1 fired Army Commander Pedro 
Machado for his role in Larriva's death.  End Summary. 
 
Army Commander Canned 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Acting Minister of Defense Ricardo Patino fired Army 
Commander Pedro Machado on February 1 for "human errors" that 
lead to the death of former MinDef Guadalupe Larriva.  In a 
television interview on February 1, Patino said "we gave you 
(the military) a minister alive and you returned her dead." 
He expressed his dissatisfaction with the preliminary 
accident report and said that those at fault would be held 
accountable.  Machado told the press that his departure was 
necessary to calm tensions, but said that a commander could 
not be blamed for all that happens in the army.  "There are 
levels of responsibility," he affirmed.  Machado warned that 
unspecified elements within the government were trying to 
"damage" the Ecuadorian military.  Machado was replaced by 
Brigadier General Guillermo Vasconez. 
 
Shaky, Unqualified MinDef Assumes Office 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) President Correa on January 30 announced he would 
replace Guadalupe Larriva with Cuenca native Lorena Escudero. 
 In a February 1 press conference in Cuenca, a nervous 
Escudero told the press that she is a strong proponent of 
regional integration, but said that Ecuador would not be 
drawn into Plan Colombia.  She said that Ecuador would not 
extend the Manta FOL agreement beyond 2009, and that she 
would continue Larriva's efforts to increase the military's 
social role.  Escudero committed to push for salary 
increases, continue defense reforms, and signaled that 
military divestment from the economy would also top her 
agenda.  Escudero quietly assumed control of the Ecuadorian 
military on February 2. 
 
Biographical Information 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) Escudero, 41, is a native of Cuenca, Azuay province. 
She is divorced with two children.  Escudero holds a degree 
in education with an emphasis in philosophy, sociology, and 
economics from the University of Cuenca.  She has masters in 
Latin American Studies from Mexico's National Autonomy 
University and is currently working towards a doctorate in 
Latin America Studies from the Spanish Alicante University. 
 
¶5.  (U) Escudero has worked since 2002 as director of the 
Center for Social Sciences and Latin American Politics at the 
University of Cuenca.  She has published numerous works on 
regional integration, and has worked as a consultant on 
immigration related issues.  Escudero reportedly worked on 
Correa's presidential campaign, and served as coordinator of 
the Cuenca University and Citizens' Front for a Constituent 
Assembly. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (C) While intelligent, Escudero certainly appears to lack 
the background and qualifications to head Ecuador's military 
and meet the security challenges the nation faces.  Larriva 
was similarly under-qualified in terms of knowledge, but had 
the proven toughness and sharp elbows from political party 
life to compensate.  Escudero will face a suspicious military 
establishment, many of whom will be hoping to see her fail. 
Let's hope our friendly offers of help will resonant amid 
these tensions; we will seek to engage the new MinDef early 
to discuss CN/CT cooperation, and to offer, where 
appropriate, USG assistance in building a more professional 
and informed defense structure.
