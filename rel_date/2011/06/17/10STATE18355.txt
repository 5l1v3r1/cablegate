AMERICAN CITIZEN ISSUES 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Judge Bernard Saint-Vil said the two American 
missionaries who remain incarcerated, Laura Silsby and Charisa 
Coulter, will be jailed through February 28 and possibly 
longer, as he awaits more testimony.  The judge requested two 
real estate agents and a pastor from the Dominican Republic to 
testify in Port-au-Prince about property the missionaries 
rented to set up an orphanage.  The additional testimony is 
expected March 1.  Saint-Vil plans to issue his ruling the 
week of March 1.  (AP) 
 
HUMANITARIAN/SECURITY/INFRASTRUCTURE 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) USAID determined approximately 45 percent of homes in 
Port-au-Prince are safe for habitation.  Approximately 130,000 
households have received basic shelter assistance. 
(NOC Update Report No.87) 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Government of Haiti is considering a plan to 
offer amnesty to approximately 4,500 escaped inmates.  The UN 
Stabilization Mission in Haiti and the Haitian National Police 
have apprehended 140 escaped criminals and will continue to 
pursue the remaining 356.  (NOC Update Report No.87) 
 
¶5. (SBU) The USNS COMFORT will begin to distribute more than 
200 pallets of medical commodities to the Haitian medical 
community, targeting health facilities in affected areas 
outside of Port-au-Prince.  (NOC Update Report No.87) 
 
¶6. (SBU) The World Food Program is moving into the second 
phase of its operations.  It aims to assist 300,000 families 
in the Port-au-Prince area with a full food basket of corn-soy 
blend, oil, salt, beans, and rice.  (OCHA Sitrep No.24) 
 
¶7. (SBU) 86,403 Haitians are now engaged in cash-for-work 
activities. The work includes clearing small debris, the 
drainage and irrigation of canals, and solid waste 
management.  (OCHA Sitrep No.24) 
 
¶8. (U) The U.S. military expects to fully transfer management 
of the airport and ports back to the Haitian government by 
March 1.  USAID/DART anticipates an increase in congestion 
following the transfer due to a lack of heavy equipment and 
the government's limited capacity to offload aircraft and 
ships.  (USAID Factsheet No.40)
