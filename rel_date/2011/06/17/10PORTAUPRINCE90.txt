SUBJECT: TFHA01: EMBASSY PORT AU PRINCE EARTHQUAKE SITREP as of 1800, 
Day 13 
 
¶1.      (SBU)  Summary:  Earthquake damage in a rural agricultural 
area near Port-au-Prince was relatively light, but communities are 
being challenged by incoming migrants from the capital city and the 
lack of cash to purchase its agricultural produce.  The rural 
regional hospital is receiving patients from the hospital ship 
Comfort, to clear beds for more critically-injured victims onboard. 
In Port-au-Prince, gasoline and fresh produce are readily available 
at pre-quake prices, but few residents have the cash to buy them. 
Banks and wire transfer companies are open, but cash is not flowing 
fast enough to support the local economy.  The Parliament struggles 
vainly to become relevant in the crisis.  Business leaders present 
ideas to accelerate recovery.  Port damage is worse than originally 
thought.  The airport plans to commence limited commercial 
operations on February 15.  End summary. 
 
 
 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFTERSHOCKS OUTSIDE OF PORT-AU-PRINCE 
 
 
 
¶2.      (SBU)  Poloff visited several rural mountain communities 
approximately eight miles southwest of Port-au-Prince to assess 
damage and economic conditions.  In the six districts that include 
Kenscoff and its environs, damage and injuries were light. 
According to the Director General (DG) of the Kenscoff mayor's 
office, there were: 
 
*         1,646 homes destroyed; 
 
*         2,403 damaged homes; 
 
*         13,662 people without shelter; 
 
*         127 people injured; and 
 
*         61 deaths. 
 
The DG also said that there were approximately 6,000 migrants who 
have evacuated Port-au-Prince and moved into the area, most living 
with family members and only a few camping in public areas. 
 
 
 
¶3.      (SBU)  Little damage could be seen in Kenscoff and its 
surrounding villages, with only a few damaged buildings and walls. 
The DG said that the majority of damage, injuries and deaths 
occurred among the many isolated farms in the region.  The region's 
economy is based on agriculture. 
 
 
 
¶4.      (SBU)  Living conditions in the Kenscoff area appeared to 
be unaffected by the quake.  The public water system (supplied by 
springs) is meeting all water needs, the markets were filled with 
fresh produce and staples, and vehicle traffic was at a normal 
level.  However, the DG said that fruit and vegetable producers in 
the region are suffering from low sales in their primary market of 
Port-au-Prince, where few residents have cash to purchase their 
goods. 
 
 
 
¶5.      (SBU)  A few miles from Kenscoff, the Baptist Mission 
Hospital was treating approximately 400 patients injured in the 
earthquake.  Many of those were from Port-au-Prince, who were 
transported via helicopter from the USNS Hospital Ship Comfort to 
vacate beds needed for more seriously injured victims.  The victims 
sent to the Baptist Mission from the Comfort consisted primarily of 
broken legs.  Doctors at the hospital said they were running short 
of critical supplies. 
 
 
 
SITUATION IN PORT-AU-PRINCE 
 
 
 
¶6.      (SBU)  Poloff visited several sites in Port-au-Prince: 
 
 
 
*         Most gas stations were open, with no lines.  The price of 
gasoline was USD 4.35 per gallon - the same as pre-quake prices. 
The reason there were no lines, according to Poloff's discussions 
with station attendants, was that few people have the cash to buy 
gas. 
 
 
 
*         Street side markets, where most residents purchase fresh 
produce, are open in abundance, with large quantities and a wide 
assortment of fruits and vegetables.  Almost all of the produce 
came from the Kenscoff area.  Imported items like rice, beans and 
even cheese, came from pre-quake stocks.  Prices were at or only 
slightly elevated above normal, owing to the large quantities of 
goods and few purchasers.  Vendors complained that sales were low 
because few people have cash. 
 
 
 
*         Some banks and most wire transfer companies were open, 
with long but orderly lines.  However, it is clear that access to 
cash is the bottleneck that is choking the local economy. 
 
 
 
*         PNH officers were stationed on several major 
intersections, where none were observed only two days ago. 
Nevertheless, PNH presence is still far below its pre-quake level. 
 
 
 
PARLIAMENT SEEKING RELEVANCE 
 
¶7.      (SBU)  On January 25, the Lower Chamber passed a resolution 
(non-binding) outlining broad principles for the relief and 
reconstruction efforts.  The resolution had no legal effect and 
received little coverage in the press.  The Lower Chamber also 
formed two special committees, one on aid management and the other 
on planning Haiti's reconstruction. 
 
¶8.      (SBU)  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive and 
other Ministers did not appear at a Senate hearing to which they 
were invited, citing other priorities on their agendas.  Senator 
Michel Clerie is now Senate President ad interim, in the absence of 
Kely Bastien, recovering in the United States from injuries 
sustained in the quake. 
 
¶9.      (SBU)  Parliament is attempting to re-establish itself and 
has asked for help from the Executive in getting access to internet 
and radio.  However, it continues to be sidelined by the Executive, 
the media and other actors involved in relief efforts. 
 
PRIVATE SECTOR PRESENTS IDEAS FOR MOVING FORWARD 
 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU)  Members of the Haiti's Economic Forum, comprised of 
business leaders, met with EmbOffs on January 26 to discuss how the 
private sector can move forward.  Reginald Boulos, President of the 
Forum, declared, "The most important step is bridging the 
recovery," referring to interim actions that can be taken by the 
private sector to bolster the economy on the road to recovery. 
Boulos stated that the immediate goal is to speed up the re-opening 
of businesses in five key areas:  banks, gas stations, 
supermarkets, telecommunications and garment production.  The 
private sector is also working with the Minister of Finance and the 
Government of the Dominican Republic to establish procedures to 
facilitate customs processing. 
 
¶11.  (SBU)  Lionel Delatour recommended the construction of new 
industrial parks beyond Port-au-Prince.  In particular, he noted 
the importance of focusing on industries other than the garment 
sector, which only employs approximately 20% of employees in the 
formal sector. 
 
SEAPORTS AND AIRPORTS 
 
¶12.  (SBU)  The sole working pier at the principal port is no 
longer operating and will be out of commission for an unknown 
period.  Divers inspecting the previously damaged pier noticed new 
damage that will stop all traffic until it is repaired. However, 
the US Navy has already brought in equipment to handle barges and 
will use smaller vessels to load and unload ships, avoiding the 
pier.   Alternate sites are available in nearby locations outside 
of the port, but the throughput is unknown on those wharfs.  The 
military should still be able to handle the arriving rations  for 
the "food surge", but non-priority traffic may have to wait in 
harbor for longer periods. 
 
 
 
¶13.  (SBU)  The head of the Civil Aviation Authority told military 
officials today that American Airlines will begin flying into the 
airport on February 15.  To do this, the airport plans to spend USD 
400K to repair the west end of the terminal, a project estimated by 
Haitian engineers to require USD 650K.  He asked if the USG would 
fund the difference.  He also said that no other airlines would be 
able to use the airport, reasoning that since American normally 
serves 70% of the passengers, it should be allowed to operate first 
in the small part of the terminal that is reparable.  He also said 
that he was going to restrict UN access to the commercial tarmac.
