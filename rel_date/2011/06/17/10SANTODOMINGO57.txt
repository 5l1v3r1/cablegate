SUBJECT: DR Firms Ask to Be Allowed to Bid on Haiti Reconstruction 
Contracts 
 
¶1. On 2/10, Charge and Emboffs met with representatives of the 
Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic (AIRD) to 
discuss the Dominican private sector's desire to bid on Haitian 
reconstruction projects.  The representatives were from the two 
largest producers of reinforced steel and roofing materials in the 
Dominican Republic - INCA and METALDOM - and used their sector as 
an example of the situation faced by the whole of Dominican 
industry.  Francisco Garcia, the President of INCA, highlighted 
that many of his sector's products, such as rebar and PVC pipes, 
not only meet ASTM standards but also qualify as "Buy American" 
given their significant U.S.-produced content (from suppliers such 
as Nucor, Shintec, Oxy, and Ameristeel).  Garcia provided a list of 
items INCA has on hand for immediate delivery, including 25,000 
metric tons of rebar, 200,000 units of galvanized roofing sheets, 
and 1,000 metric tons of PVC pipes and fitting.  (NOTE:  Post will 
send the full list and the aide-de-memoire provided by the group 
via e-mail to WHA/CAR.  END NOTE.)  Moreover, INCA and METALDOM can 
work in tandem with DR-based construction companies on 
reconstruction projects; for example, a Dominican construction firm 
has experience building low-income housing, constructing 5,000 to 
10,000 units per project. 
 
 
 
¶2. Haiti is both companies' largest export market; they provide 60 
to 80 percent of the reinforced steel in Haiti and they are major 
supplies of rebar and PVC pipes.  Since the earthquake, this market 
has virtually disappeared.  Although the companies believe business 
will revive once reconstruction projects begin, they are concerned 
that the influx of donated construction materials has the potential 
to significantly undermine such a revival by creating excess supply 
of goods.  Garcia claimed that a similar situation occurred in 
Jamaica after a hurricane several years ago, where a flood of 
roofing material created a 10-year stockpile and destroyed the 
local roofing plant.  He noted that DR rolling mills are only 
operating at 50 percent capacity and its roofing plants at 40 
percent capacity, so they have sufficient inventory and capacity to 
sell to Haiti immediately (as noted above).  Moreover, given the 
advantage the companies enjoy due to proximity, they can also have 
the material into Haiti in six hours.  Garcia stressed that they 
are not looking for favored treatment, but rather the opportunity 
to bid. 
 
 
 
¶3. The Charge noted that he has been an advocate of improved 
business ties between Haiti and the DR and asked Garcia to supply 
information outlining the capabilities of INCA, METALDOM, and other 
DR firms in supplying building materials and working with Dominican 
construction firms to build housing.  The Charge also suggested 
they meet with other donors - such as the Canadians and UNDP - to 
improve their visibility.  Garcia replied that they had already 
provided the list of goods they can supply to the Clinton Global 
Initiative.
