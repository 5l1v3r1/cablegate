citizens remain inside the Embassy and none remain outside

quake, with another 609,000 displaced and still without 
shelter, according to OCHA.  (SOUTHCOM DCO) 
 
¶16. (SBU)   The security situation remains generally calm and 
most major roads remain open.  Looting and criminal activity 
continue in downtown Port-au-Prince, with small groups of 
young men seeking targets of opportunity.   Escaped convicts 
are returning to their former areas and attempting to 
reorganize their gangs.  (TF1/Interagency Conference Call, 
JTF-Haiti SitRep) 
 
¶17. (SBU)  The Haitian government is providing free bus 
service to help people move from Port-au-Prince to areas 
outside the capital.  As many as 130,000 people have left 
the city, according to UN and GOH estimates.  Many Haitians 
are migrating toward larger relief distribution points that 
have a security presence; 500,000 people are reportedly 
gathered near the airport, one of two major U.S. military 
distribution sites. (SOUTHCOM DCO, TF1/Interagency 
Conference Call, JTF-Haiti SitRep)

distribution, the majority of recipients were appreciative.

US military.  (TF1/JTF-Haiti SitRep)
