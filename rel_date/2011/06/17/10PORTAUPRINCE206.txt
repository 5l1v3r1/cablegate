REF: 10 PORT AU PRINCE 120 
 
¶1.      (SBU)  Within two weeks of the January 12 earthquake, 
Haiti's garment manufacturing sector resumed exports to the US, 
re-routing shipments through Dominican ports.  Prior to the 
earthquake, apparel assembled in Haiti accounted for three-quarters 
of the country's exports, employing one-fifth of the formal sector. 
Of the eighteen garment manufacturers in Port au Prince, two must 
relocate and rebuild from the ground up; one factory that 
completely collapsed crushed hundreds of workers inside, at least 
300 of whom did not survive.  Despite the loss of workers and 
limited access to basic resources, including electricity, many 
factories have reopened, simultaneously undertaking minor to 
moderate repairs, clean-up, and reconstruction.  Shipping from 
Haiti resumed in less than a month, meeting customers' expectations 
of having their orders filled on time.  Logistics constraints, 
while not wholly solved, have been overcome more quickly than 
expected, and increased international support for the industry aims 
to create more jobs and bolster the Haitian economy. 
 
 
 
¶2.      (SBU)  International investors, brands, and manufacturers 
who expressed interest in expanding production in Haiti before the 
earthquake renewed their commitment to support the Haitian apparel 
industry, taking advantage of the trade preferences of the HOPE II 
Act for duty-free export to the US (reftel A).  At the apparel 
industry's largest trade show in Las Vegas in February, the US 
Trade Representative (USTR), along with Gap Inc., Hanes Brands, and 
the US Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparels announced 
the Plus One for Haiti initiative, urging clothing retailers to 
"buy Haitian" and source at least one percent of their total 
apparel production from Haiti.  Representatives from the GOH 
Presidential Commission for the Implementation of HOPE (CTMO-HOPE) 
are currently in Washington working with USTR on an additional HOPE 
extension. 
 
 
 
¶3.      (SBU)  Given the increased attention to Haiti, investors 
are giving consideration not only to build more factories but also 
to create more jobs by supporting infrastructure, such as 
electricity and water, needed to sustain the industrial parks and 
free trade zones that would house these factories in 
Port-au-Prince, as well as other potential industrial hubs, 
including Cap Haitien in the north.  Representatives from 
high-volume customers, such as Gap Inc. in Korea, are visiting 
Haiti to explore expansion plans that originated before the 
earthquake.  The World Bank and IMF are conducting port assessments 
specifically with respect to capacity to handle shipping containers 
for garments. 
 
 
 
¶4.      (SBU)  Comment:  The apparel manufacturers in Haiti operate 
on a high volume, thin margin, low capitalization basis where cash 
flow is extremely important for the business to survive.  Industry 
representatives have told us that the garment sector wouldgreatly 
benefit from a "soft loan" fund of USD 20 million for their 
immediate working capital cash needs, granting concessionary loans 
with an extended grace period and affordable interest rates to 
enable manufacturers to operate at full capacity as soon as 
possible, retain the 28,000 workers already employed, and expand 
production to benefit under the special trade provisions of the 
HOPE II Act.  Combined with other USG initiatives bolstering the 
garment sector, such a loan would send a positive signal to U.S. 
retailers and producers in Haiti and the Caribbean, and should also 
send an encouraging message to the more than 25,000 Haitian factory 
workers who rely on garment factory jobs to provide for themselves 
and their families.  End comment.
