¶1.      (SBU) Summary: Criticisms of President Preval continue, 
including from within the government, and various rumors of a 
pro-US rally are yet to materialize. Meanwhile, some 
parliamentarians are asking for an extension of their mandate by 
two years. Their request is unconstitutional and unlikely to gain 
traction unless a broader political consensus emerges for long-term 
political stability. On a positive note, private port owners are 
cooperating with the Port-au-Prince port authority to maximize 
offloading capacity. End Summary. 
 
 
 
INCREASING CRITICISMS 
 
 
 
¶2.      (SBU) Several political figures, including the current 
Minister of Interior, Paul Antoine Bien-Aime, called for the 
resignation of President Preval's government on a local radio show, 
amidst increasing criticism of the government's unresponsiveness 
following the January 12 earthquake. Myrlande Manigat, Charles 
Baker (both leaders of opposition political parties), Deputy 
Stephen Benoit (formerly close the President Preval's political 
party), Daniel Supplice (a well-know sociologist), and Paul 
Bien-Aime (Minister of Interior) were interviewed on a panel, 
deploring the Government's inability to meet the basic needs of the 
population post-disaster. All also spoke of the risk of mass 
protests, should the perceived void in leadership continue. 
 
 
 
¶3.      (SBU) Meanwhile, rumors of a major pro-US rally abound, 
picked up US military personnel on the ground. However, there has 
not been any large pro-US or anti-Preval demonstration yet. The 
Embassy is not aware of any planned protests backed by political 
players at this time. 
 
 
 
PARLIAMENTARIANS' DREAMS 
 
 
 
¶4.      (SBU) Some parliamentarians are proposing to ask President 
Preval to postpone upcoming elections and extend the parliament's 
term by two years. The initiative has yet to be considered by the 
legislative body, and would be unconstitutional. Key 
parliamentarians, including Deputy Stephen Benoit, are opposed to 
it. Parliament's mandate ends in May 2010 (already a contested 
extension from its January mandate according to the 1987 
Constitution), and any continuation in its activities would need to 
be part of a broad political consensus aimed at political stability 
and perhaps the re-writing of a new Constitution. 
 
 
 
PORT UPDATE 
 
¶5.      (SBU) The Port-au-Prince Port Authority (APN) and owners of 
private piers are cooperating (with USG involvement) to maximize 
port loading and cargo distribution opportunities by sharing out 
pier space for relief cargo. This would allow for increased 
efficiency until the government port infrastructure is 
reconstituted, a requirement for sustaining the current volume of 
operations.   Several ships are in the three available ports 
unloading.  As three ships (Mexican naval vessel, Colombian naval 
vessel and a Puerto Rican barge) brought in break-bulk cargo that 
is being unloaded by hand, movement of ships in those piers has 
been blocked as the vessels spend days in port.  This underlines 
the importance of bringing in containerized cargo. The AMERICAN 
TRADER is scheduled to arrive 2/1; this will be the first 
commercial traffic since reopening of South pier at APN.  She will 
offload 366 containers and load 500 empties.  The military 
logistics personnel intend to surge to around the clock operations 
until the offload is complete. 
 
THE GOLD RUSH IS ON! 
 
 
 
¶6.      (SBU) As Haiti digs out from the earthquake, different 
companies are moving in to sell their concepts, products and 
services.  President Preval met with Gen Wesley Clark  Saturday and 
received a sales presentation on a hurricane/earthquake resistant 
foam core house designed for low income residents.  AshBritt has 
been talking to various institutions about a national plan for 
rebuilding all government buildings.  Other companies are proposing 
their housing solutions or their land use planning ideas, or other 
construction concepts.  Each is vying for the ear of President in a 
veritable free-for-all.  Presidential advisor Leslie Voltaire and 
Minister of Tourism Patrick Delatour, working with the NGO and the 
UN shelter "cluster" have a systematic approach, but the attention 
of the President is on impressive new (expensive) designs.
