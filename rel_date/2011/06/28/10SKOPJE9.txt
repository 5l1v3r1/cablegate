(End Summary) 
 
¶2. The reason the nation desires the articles or services. 
 
The procurement of these devices will greatly enhance the 
capabilities of Macedonian armed forces (ARM) deployed in 
support of the Vermont National Guard-led, Macedonian 
"Embedded Operational and Mentor Liaison Team8 (OMLT) in 
Afghanistan.  These devices will directly contribute to the 
ARM ability to operate with U.S. forces and NATO allies 
supporting the International Security Force Afghanistan 
(ISAF) as well as any future operations. 
 
¶3. How the articles or services would affect the recipient's 
force structure. 
 
These devices will have no impact on ARM force structure. 
 
¶4. How the articles or services would contribute to both the 
U.S. and the recipient's defense/security goals. 
 
These devices will enhance the ARM ability to conduct night 
operations and to identify other friendly U.S. and NATO 
forces. 
 
¶5. The anticipated reaction of neighboring nations. 
 
Macedonia already possesses these capabilities. Moreover 
these devices are to support ARM operations in Afghanistan. 
Post does not foresee an adverse reaction by neighboring 
nations. 
 
¶6. Assess the nation's ability to safeguard, operate, 
maintain, and support the articles. 
 
Macedonia already possesses generation III NVDs and has 
clearly demonstrated that it maintains the required security 
level and accountability procedures for these and other 
similar devices. 
 
¶7. Training required either in-country or in the U.S. and the 
possible impact of any in-country U.S. presence that might be 
required as a result of providing the article. 
 
Considering the total-package approach which has been 
requested, training will be included and should not involve 
more than 2-3 persons in country more than 10 days. 
 
¶8. Possible impact of any in-country U.S. presence that might 
be required as a result of providing the articles. 
 
None.  U.S. personnel regularly conduct training events in 
Macedonia. 
 
¶9. Source of financing and the economic impact of the 
proposed acquisition. 
 
None.  U.S. FY10 NDAA section 1206 authority will fund the 
acquisition.  Country team does not anticipate any adverse 
economic impact. 
 
¶10. Human rights considerations relevant to the proposed 
acquisition. 
 
None.  There are no human rights considerations that bear on 
this acquisition. 
 
¶11. End-use monitoring (EUM) for sensitive and advanced 
warfighting technology and the SCO's plan for compliance 
verification. 
 
Macedonia already possesses generation III devices.  These 
items will be added to our current EUM execution plan. 
 
¶12. Recommendation whether the USG should approve transfer of 
the article and justification. 
 
Post strongly recommends immediate approval of this request 
for the procurement of these NVDs. These articles will 
enhance the combat effectiveness of troops deploying to 
support Macedonia's Embedded OMLT in support of ISAF. These 
devices will directly contribute to the readiness level of 
the Macedonian armed forces and its interoperability with 
U.S. and NATO Forces. Agreeing to this request will also 
reinforce the strong bilateral relationship between our 
nations and strengthen Macedonian resolve to continue its 
support to ISAF and future coalition operations.
