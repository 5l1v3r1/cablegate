¶1. (U) On December 31, 2007, post received a letter from the 
Nicaraguan Ministry of Energy and Mines expressing an interest in 
joining the Partnership for Clean Indoor Air (PCIA).  Informal 
translation of letter follows.  Post will forward original letter to 
Department. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Begin informal translation: 
 
I would like to thank you for the kind invitation you made to our 
government to join the Partnership for Clean Indoor Air (PCIA). 
 
We are proud to announce that we accept your invitation to join 
PCIA.  The Ministry of Energy and Mines considers this a great 
opportunity to enforce and strengthen the different strategies PCIA 
has been developing to modernize the wood-burning-for-fuel sector, 
which, in our energy matrix represents over 50% of all energies 
used. 
 
The generation of energy and through burning of wood is and will be 
a primary resource for low income families for food preparation and 
small artisan activities.  The inefficient use of wood and coal for 
energy generation is harmful to health, especially for children.  It 
also damages family economies and the environment.  For these 
reasons, we think these initiatives will prove useful to improve 
quality of life. 
 
We appreciate your kind attention. 
 
Best regards, 
Lorena Lanza E 
Acting Minister
