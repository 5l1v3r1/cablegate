Classified By: Ambassador Robert J. Callahan for reasons 1.4 (b & d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On April 21 and 22 Ambassador Callahan 
traveled for the first time to Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua's 
North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN).  During his two-day 
trip, he met with opposition, religious and indigenous 
leaders, held a press conference, and inaugurated a 
USAID-funded school in Santa Marta to replace one destroyed 
by hurricane Felix in September 2007.  While the visit came 
shortly after a declaration of independence by the Miskito 
Council of Elders (see reftel A), the Ambassador made clear 
our support for Nicaragua,s territorial integrity.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
OPPOSITION LEADERS LEARY ABOUT INDEPENDENCE DECLARATION 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶2. (C) During a lunch meeting with RAAN opposition and 
regional leaders, including former Puerto Cabezas mayoral 
candidates Osorno "Blas" Coleman, Ambassador Callahan 
discussed the recent election of the "Wihta Tara" (Miskito 
for Grand Judge) by the Miskito Council of Elders and his 
subsequent declaration of independence for the Miskito Coast 
(see reftel A).  Coleman told the Ambassador that while there 
are many in the Miskito community that support the concept of 
independence because of decades of broken promises by the 
successive Nicaraguan national and regional leaders, he 
thought that the Council of Elders were going about it the 
wrong way.  Instead of unilaterally declaring independence, 
Coleman said that the Council of Elders needed to consult 
with other ethnic and indigenous groups in both autonomous 
regions and hold a referendum.  Without strong internal & 
international support and financial resources, the experiment 
was likely to fail. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
AMBASSADOR PRESS CONFERENCE & RADIO ADDRESS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Immediately following the lunch meeting, the 
Ambassador visited Bluefields Indian and Caribbean University 
(BICU) and held meetings with its Rector and administration, 
followed afterwards by a press conference also held on the 
campus.  During the press conference, which consisted 
primarily of local media/radio outlets and a "La Prensa" 
regional newspaper correspondent, the Ambassador fielded 
general questions about USG programs in the region.  One 
reporter asked about the USG position on the recent 
independence declaration by the Wihta Tara, and the 
Ambassador responded that the US supports the territorial 
integrity of Nicaragua and that this was an internal matter 
for the people of Nicaragua to resolve peacefully.  At the 
conclusion of the press conference, the Ambassador gave a 
15-minute radio address in Spanish, which was simultaneously 
translated into Miskito by Javier Williams, former Vice 
Foreign Minister, at radio station VECA.  During this 
impromptu radio address, the Ambassador emphasized the 
friendship and cooperation that the USG shares with 
Nicaraguans in the RAAN, as demonstrated by our 2007 
Hurricane Felix relief assistance (see reftel C) and the 
two-week-long humanitarian visit of the USS Kearsarge in 
August 2008.

MEETINGS WITH FSLN LANDGRAB VICTIM & MISKITO SURVIVOR 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶4. (C) Later that day the Ambassador met with James "Jimmy" 
Webster, a former Nicaraguan professional baseball player 
from the Atlantic Coast during the 1970's and presidential 
candidate in 1996.  Webster, a Creole-Miskito originally from 
Bluefields, is the grandson of Samuel Pitts, a famous 
indigenous leader who raised an army of over 6,000 Miskito 
Indians to attack Managua in the early 1900's over the 
illegal incorporation of the Caribbean coast into Nicaragua. 
Webster was educated in the United States and received his 
bachelor,s degree in forestry.  He served as an official in 
the Ministry of Forestry under a previous administration and 
was working as a contractor with the Academy of Educational 
Development (AED) Spiny Lobster Project. In the 1980's, Mr. 
Webster's cattle ranch in the RAAN was expropriated by the 
Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) and converted 
into a military base to fight the Contras.  He lost hundreds 
of heads of cattle, trucks, and his home in the illegal 
action, but has never received any compensation from the GON. 
 Webster explained that the current independence movement was 
nothing new and that he was a co-author with former coastal 
Sandinista leader Ray Hooker of the Law 28 which established 
the two autonomous regions in 1987. 
 
¶5. (C) The Ambassador held a dinner meeting with Catholic 
Church leader Father Rudolfo French. Father French is a 
Miskito, who at age thirteen was violently removed from his 
family's traditional village on the Rio Coco by FSLN troops 
led by Manuel Calderon, the current mayor of Leon (see reftel 
D).  He and his family wandered for weeks through the 
war-torn area until entering refugee camps outside of Puerto 
Cabezas.  The experience changed him forever -- Father French 
dedicated the rest of his life to God and currently leads the 
Catholic Church's missionary efforts in the RAAN.

USG FULFILLS PROMISES 
--------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) In September 2007 Hurricane Felix destroyed hundreds 
of homes, schools, churches and public buildings in the RAAN 
(see reftel B and C).  One of the main purposes for the 
Ambassador,s trip was to inaugurate a new school, 
constructed through USAID's Excelencia program in the Miskito 
community of Santa Marta, which was devastated by Hurricane 
Felix.  When EmbOff visited Santa Marta four months earlier 
(reftel B), the children were still holding classes in an old 
barn under USAID tarps.  Now they have a brand new school 
building with modern features, electrical outlets, and 
reinforced construction to serve as a community shelter in 
the event of severe weather.  In addition to the new school 
facilities, USAID through a grant to local NGO FADCANIC 
supplied the school with new bi-lingual textbooks (Spanish 
and Miskito) and materials.  The inauguration ceremony took 
place on April 22 and included dignitaries from the Ministry 
of Education, the Santa Marta community, and Ray Hooker, 
president of FADCANIC.  Martha Downs, the FSLN Vice-Mayor of 
Puerto Cabezas, also attended the ceremony in the audience, 
although she had not been invited.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (C) The issue of RAAN independence clearly inevitably 
required prominence in Ambassador meetings with political and 
religious leaders as well as the press.  The "La Prensa" 
national newspaper carried a story about the Ambassador's 
visit on April 23, reporting on the school inauguration event 
in Santa Marta.  However, all subsequent reports about the 
trip (see septel) have focused on the issue of independence 
and the "coincidence" of the U.S. Ambassador,s first 
official trip to the RAAN occurring immediately following the 
declaration of independence by the Wihta Tara and the Miskito 
Council of Elders (reftel A).  During the two-day trip we 
were contacted several times by Oscar Hodgson, the legal 
advisor to the Miskito Council of Elders, to schedule an 
"emergency meeting" between the Ambassador and the new Wihta 
Tara; however, we refused to meet.
