Classified By: Ambassador Robert J. Callahan, Reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary.  Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega is likely 
to use his participation in the Summit of the Americas to 
further his image as a world leader in opposition to the 
United States, press for an end to sanctions against Cuba, 
and seek increased financial aid without governance or 
democracy conditions.  Ortega remains skeptical of the OAS in 
general and has recently taken positions orchestrated to 
further alienate the international community, including 
dismissing the March 31 meeting of Central American leaders 
with VPOTUS and breaking off free trade negotiations with the 
EU.  Visits to Cuba and Venezuela prior to the Summit may 
sharpen Ortega's public confrontational attitude, though he 
is likely to be reserved and cordial in private and smaller 
meetings.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Ortega is likely to use his participation in the 
Summit as an opportunity to project further his image as a 
world leader among those aligned against the United States. 
Ortega will arrive in Port of Spain following a visit to Cuba 
and participation in the April 14-15 ALBA Summit in Caracas, 
both of which are likely to sharpen his confrontational 
attitude.  Ortega is not fully committed to the OAS or the 
Summit process and continues to view the OAS with suspicion, 
accusing it of interference in domestic political affairs and 
of overlooking supposed electoral fraud committed by 
"neo-liberals" in 1996 and 2001 while continuing to 
criticize, unfairly in his mind, his conduct of the 
fraudulent November 2008 municipal elections.  Ortega 
previously stated (ref b) that his top agenda items for the 
Summit include: restoration of Cuba to the OAS and an end to 
all sanctions against the island; the development of a new 
organization of Latin American states that excludes the U.S. 
and Canada to resist the political influence of "the Empire;" 
and a commitment from member states to provide assistance on 
a nonpolitical basis and without conditions. 
 
¶3. (C) On March 21, Ortega told Trinidad and Tobago Prime 
Minister Patrick Manning that he will also use the Summit to 
"demand" the U.S. increase funding for Central America in its 
fight against narco-traffickers.  He complained that in 2008, 
the GoN seized "370 million dollars worth of drugs and in 
exchange the U.S. gives us scarcely 1.2 million dollars." 
(Note: Ortega has long complained that U.S. anti-drug 
assistance is insufficient and has advocated a 1 billion 
dollar plan of U.S.-backed loan guarantees to be paid for 
with seized assets. End note.)  Additionally, he told Manning 
that he would call on the U.S. to provide more assistance to 
the region to confront the global economic crisis, "which was 
caused by the U.S."  Orlando Gomez, advisor to Ortega and 
Director General for the Americas at the Foreign Ministry 
(MINREX), has publicly said that the GoN would also seek to 
raise renewable energy, social development and the 
environment but GoN officials have not elaborated their 
position on these issues.  MINREX has declined our requests 
for a meeting to discuss their formal agenda for the Summit. 
 
¶4. (C) Ortega's Summit participation follows a series of 
events in which GoN has taken positions apparently 
orchestrated to further alienate the international community 
while strengthening his image as a populist regional and 
world leader.  At the March 25 SICA Summit in Managua, Ortega 
had sought agreement to lower the level of participation in 
the March 30 meeting with VPOTUS and agreement on a statement 
of principles eliminating democracy and governance conditions 
on international assistance.  Ortega was unsuccessful in both 
objectives and sent Vice Foreign Minister Manuel Coronel 
Kautz, an opponent of the Merida Initiative, to the meeting. 
Ortega later complained that VPOTUS "came with empty hands" 
and orchestrated the meeting with Costa Rica in order "to 
divide rather than unite" the region.  Defending his decision 
to send Coronel Kautz, Ortega told a Sandinista crowd, "what 
was the result of the meeting?  It produced nothing."  Most 
recently, Nicaragua broke off negotiations with the EU on a 
free trade agreement after EU representatives refused to 
agree to create a 60 billion Euro fund for Central America 
and declined to provide assistance without conditionality 
(septel). 
 
¶5. (C) Based on his past performances at UNGA, regional 
summits, and senior-level meetings with USG officials, Ortega 
is likely to reserve his most heated rhetoric for public and 
plenary sessions, when his public posturing can be picked up 
by the media.  In private meetings, he tends to be more 
reserved and cordial but will seek to dominate the discussion 
with a recounting of the hardships suffered by Nicaragua in 
the 1980s and 1990s if interlocutors raise controversial 
issues such as democracy, governance and respect for human 
rights.
