SUBJECT: COMMEMORATING THE GREAT WHITE FLEET IN NICARAGUA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 153116 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Nicaragua appreciates the invitation to 
commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Great White Fleet. 
We note that President Ortega has exhibited a penchant for 
attacking "U.S. imperialism and interventionism," though not 
the Great White Fleet specifically.  However, Ortega also 
begrudgingly acknowledges that the U.S., particularly the 
military, have consistently provided humanitarian assistance 
to the Nicaraguan people in times of crisis, including most 
recently, the September 2007 operation to provide relief 
following Hurricane Felix. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In light of these considerations, we believe that 
the most appropriate method to commemorate this anniversary 
would be to incorporate commemoration events into the already 
planned port visits scheduled for 2008.  These include the 
confirmed visit of the USS Kearsarge to Puerto Cabezas August 
6-21, 2008 to undertake humanitarian operations including 
medical, dental and veterinary care, as well as humanitarian 
construction projects.  A second opportunity would be during 
the potential visit of the USS Forrest Sherman to Puerto 
Corinto in July 2008.
