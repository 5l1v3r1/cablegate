¶1.  (C) President Daniel Ortega's government generally votes 
against the U.S. position in the United Nations, and in 2008 voted 
against the U.S. position in the important issues as described in 
the Department's "Voting Practices in the United Nations 2008."  As 
noted in ref E, Nicaragua (along with Cuba and Venezuela) "have 
aligned themselves with the most radical states in the UN ... [and] 
have become among the most vociferous anti-American delegations in 
the organization."  Regarding the defamation of religion issue, the 
Ortega Administration has voted in opposition to the U.S. position 
since 2007 in the Third Committee, the Human Rights Council, and 
the UNGA plenary.  In the latest demarche delivered to the Foreign 
Ministry on the issue, the Director for the Americas noted that 
given Nicaragua's voting record under President Daniel Ortega, it 
is likely Nicaragua would vote against the U.S. position (ref C). 
 
 
 
 
¶2.  (C) In general, direct USG engagement with the Government of 
Nicaragua regarding votes in the UN has not proven successful and 
at times has proven counterproductive.  The Ortega administration 
also has not proven susceptible to international pressure - e.g., 
it has withstood pressure regarding the 2008 municipal election 
fraud although it has cost it financial assistance from the United 
States and Europe (ref D).  Moreover, the Ortega administration has 
not proven responsive to the concerns of human rights organizations 
or others outside the governing Sandinista National Liberation 
Front (FSLN).  Given the government's attitude toward the United 
States in the UN generally, and on the defamation of religion issue 
specifically, we recommend engaging the Government of Nicaragua 
through other Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil or 
Chile.  These countries are likely to hold more sway with 
Nicaragua, and the Ortega administration is more likely to follow 
them on this debate.
