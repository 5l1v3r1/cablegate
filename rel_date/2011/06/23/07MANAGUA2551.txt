¶1. (SBU) Summary: President Ortega reappointed Mario Salinas as 
President of the Nicaraguan Tourism Institute (INTUR) on November 
¶23.  Since Salinas' departure from INTUR in June, the institute had 
been paralyzed, offering no strategic vision or support to the 
sector.  Tourism experts and businessmen have welcomed Salinas' 
reappointment.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On November 23 President Ortega reappointed real estate 
developer Mario Salinas as the Executive President of the Nicaraguan 
Tourism Institute (INTUR).  Salinas left INTUR in June reportedly 
because of policy and management conflicts with former Intur 
Vice-President Nubia Arcia (ref A).  Ninette Marcenaro, who is 
currently Vice-President of INTUR and has been serving as Acting 
President since August, will remain as Vice President. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Since Salinas' departure in June, INTUR has been 
paralyzed, offering no strategic vision or support to the tourism 
sector.  In addition, INTUR lost most of its institutional expertise 
and management as approximately 60 professional staffers were either 
purged for FSLN party loyalists or quit to pursue other employment 
opportunities with less stress and uncertainty.  Industry experts 
and businesspeople told Econoffs that institutional problems and 
lack of expertise among new staff members has prevented INTUR from 
actively promoting Nicaragua's tourism sector, approving projects, 
compiling statistical data, or offering a strategic vision for the 
industry. 

¶4. (U) Businesspeople and industry experts welcomed the 
reappointment of Salinas because he is an entrepreneur involved in 
the sector who understands their concerns, and has a strategic 
vision to promote Nicaragua's tourism industry (Ref B).  They are 
optimistic that Salinas will rebuild the expertise and 
professionalism INTUR needs. 

¶5. (SBU) Comment: The reappointment of Salinas as President of INTUR 
provides a ray of hope for the tourism sector in 2008.  Industry 
insiders consider 2007 a lost year (Ref C).  Other entrepreneurs 
hope that the paralysis at INTUR would serve as a good lesson for 
the Ortega administration; that is, not to put politics above 
pragmatism.  End Comment.
