Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAGFOR) officials are unable 
to confirm Nicaraguan participation in the United Nations Food and 
Agriculture organization (FAO) High-Level Conference on World Food 
Security to be held in Rome (Ref B).  It is not clear whether 
President Ortega will attend the conference, as reported locally. 
It is possible he will remain in Nicaragua over the next several 
days to deal with the aftermath of Tropical Storm Alma, which 
battered Nicaragua's Pacific coast on May 29.  Post has extended 
invitations to MAGFOR to the U.S.-Philippine hosted lunch scheduled 
for June 3 (Ref A).
