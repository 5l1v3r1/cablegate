SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) Since our last report (ref A), the Government of Nicaragua 
(GON) has resolved one additional property claim during the current 
waiver year -- a case registered by U.S. claimant Ligia Rojas, who 
was a U.S. citizen at the time of the confiscation of her property. 
As of July 17, 2008, the GON has resolved 39 U.S. citizen claims 
belonging to 22 U.S. citizens registered with the Embassy.  There 
remain 300 U.S. citizens who await the resolution of 629 
Embassy-registered claims. 
 
GON RESOLVES CLAIM FOR LIGIA ROJAS 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On July 17, Attorney General Hernan Estrada provided the 
Embassy a copy of the final settlement document or "finiquito" 
signed on July 8, 2008, by U.S. citizen Ligia Rojas.  Mrs. Rojas 
received indemnification bonds (BPIs) with a face value of $1,545, 
523 for a 346 acre farm in the department of Esteli.  The farm was 
confiscated by the GON in December 1979.  Mrs. Rojas was a U.S. 
citizen at the time of confiscation.

GON RESOLVES 39 CLAIMS DURING 2007-08 WAIVER YEAR 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3. (SBU) With the inclusion of Mrs. Rojas' resolved case, the GON 
has resolved 39 U.S. citizen claims during this current waiver year 
belonging to 22 U.S. citizens registered with the Embassy as of July 
17, 2008.  Between August 1, 2007, and July 17, 2008, the GON 
compensated 37 claims belonging to 20 U.S. citizens via BPIs issued 
with a face value of $6,755,238.  The courts ruled during this 
waiver year that property be returned to two U.S. claimants.  In 
addition, four U.S. claimants withdrew 11 claims registered with the 
Embassy during this waiver year because they believed that they 
could not provide sufficient evidence to support their cases.  There 
remain 300 U.S. citizens who await the resolution of 629 
Embassy-registered claims.
