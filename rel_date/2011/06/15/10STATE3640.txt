EMBASSY STATUS, CASUALTIES, RESPONSE 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Embassy Port-au-Prince (PaP) confirms planes 
departed overnight and anticipates planes will be able to 
land.  The embassy is investigating to confirm the tarmac 
is operational. Brazilian and Chilean military aircraft 
are expected to land January 13 in PaP to provide relief 
supplies to MINUSTAH. (TFl/Embassy Port-au-Prince telcon) 
 
¶2. (SBU) Eight embassy employees have been injured; four 
seriously and are in need of medevac. Two American 
employees remain unaccounted for and Post is still 
attempting to account for all locally employed staff. 
Embassy housing is badly damaged.  Embassy medical 
supplies are exhausted and in need of restocking. 
(TFl/Embassy Port-au-Prince telcon) 
 
¶3. (SBU) The embassy is drawing up a list of 
approximately 80 non-emergency personnel and family 
members for ordered departure. 
(TFl/Embassy Port-au-Prince telcon) 
 
 
AMERICAN CITIZEN WELFARE 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) A seriously injured U.S. citizen appeared at the 
embassy gates; a local physician was assisting.  The U.S. 
citizen was reportedly crushed in a building collapse and 
it is likely his wife and several other U.S. citizens are 
trapped inside. The major shopping center frequented by 
westerners collapsed, and it is likely U.S. citizens were 
injured or killed. Approximately 40 U.S. citizens were 
staying in the Carib Hotel, which was damaged.  Roads in 
Port-Au-Prince are largely impassable. (TFl/Embassy Port- 
au-Prince telcon) 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Consular Call Center has handled 649 calls, 
and Task Force 2 and Post have logged 418 calls in the 
Crisis Task Force software application. Wait time is 
currently 30 minutes for callers to the call center. Post 
has issued a warden message advising the U.S. citizen 
community of conditions in Haiti. The Department has 
cleared a Travel Alert for dissemination. SOUTHCOM is 
working with post to evaluate critically injured official 
and private U.S. citizens. (TFl/TF2/Consular Call Center 
e-mails) 
 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN QUEUE 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Port-au-Prince Chief of Police reported to 
SOUTHCOM, and American Airlines confirmed, the tower at 
the PaP airport collapsed. SOUTHCOM will insert an 
airfield team with a portable Air Traffic Control package 
as soon as possible.   PaP airfield is expected to be 
operational within the next 24 hours.   (TFl/American 
Airlines e-mail, TF1/SOUTHCOM telcon) 
 
¶7. (SBU) OFDA's Disaster Assistance Response Team 
insertion and other foreign assistance is dependent on 
getting the airport functioning. If the airport is not 
available within 48 hours, OFDA plans to land in the 
Dominican Republic and cross over land. (TF1/OFDA telcon) 
 
¶8. (U) The international Red Cross and other aid groups 
say they are preparing a major disaster relief effort in 
Haiti. ICRC spokesman Simon Schorno said the Haitian Red 
Cross staff are overwhelmed. He said there is "very 
little information about the scale of the disaster." 
Britain, France, Mexico, Venezuela, and Taiwan have 
pledged to send aid teams. (AP) 
 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE SEVERELY AFFECTED 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Aftershocks were still severe early January 13. 
A team traveled out to the airport; roads remained crowded 
with people but are usable. Communications still remain 
poor. Post estimates there are 45,000 U.S. citizens in 
Haiti as a result of dual citizenship. 
(TF1/DCHA/AA e-mail) 
 
¶10. (SBU) Post anticipates significant food shortages and 
looting in the affected areas. All hospitals in the 
greater PaP vicinity are full.   (TFl/Embassy Port-au- 
Prince telcon)
