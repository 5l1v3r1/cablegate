¶1.  (U) Parliamentary deputies on August 18 voted narrowly in
favor of President Preval's objections to the original
minimum wage legislation, thereby setting the minimum wage to
HTG 125 (USD 3.00) in the textile sector and HTG 200 (USD
5.00)in the industrial and commercial sectors.  The Chamber
of Deputies first voted to consider the President's
objections, 29 to 28.  Then 38 deputies voted in favor of the
objections, 36 against, and 4 abstained.  The legislation is
now subject to Senate approval, upon which it will become law.

¶2. (U) Deputy Stephen Benoit, author of the original minimum
wage bill, accepted the vote but vowed to continue fighting
for HTG 200 in the Senate.  President of the Chamber of
Deputies Levaillant Louis Jeune called on workers to remain
patient and calm in waiting for a gradual increase in their
wages.  The Haitian Association of Industries (ADIH) welcomed
the vote but called for accompanying measures to support the
purchasing power of textile workers.

¶3.  (U) Demonstrations demanding the release of students
arrested during minimum wage protests last week turned
briefly violent again on August 18 when protestors marching
from the Faculty of Medicine began throwing rocks.  Daily
operations at SONAPI Industrial Park remain calm with Haitian
National Police (HNP) posted outside each factory.
