REF: STATE 3121

Classified By: CDA Douglas Griffiths, REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D).

¶1. (C) Charge d´Affaires Griffiths and DAS Duddy raised reftel points with Prime Minister Latortue during a meeting on January 11. DAS Duddy expressed USG concern over former president Duvalier´s application for a Haitian passport which would facilitate his return to Haiti. Duddy asked Latortue how IGOH could prevent Duvalier from reentering the country. Latortue responded that he was aware of Duvalier´s request and subsequent passport issuance at the Haitian Embassy in Paris but wondered whether he could do anything at this point to prohibit his return. Charge suggested that the PM alert airline carriers who service Haiti to prevent Duvalier from boarding a flight to Haiti. Charge also presented the option of using informal communication networks to Duvalier to transmit the message. Latortue seemed open to exploring both avenues.
