SUBJECT: INSIDE SCOOP ON REGIONAL POLITICS AND UNASUR 
 
Classified By: DCM Michael J. Fitzpatrick; reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Chilean Ambassador Fabio Vio Ugarte told Ambassador 
September 17 that he met privately with Chilean President 
Bachelet when he returned to Santiago for a COM meeting to 
prepare for the UNASUR Summit. To his surprise, she firmly 
stated her dislike for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. 
However, he said, Bachelet is under great internal pressure 
from pro-Chavez members of her administration who want her to 
publicly support Chavez.  She is also being criticized 
domestically for not doing enough for Chile's neighbors and 
focusing too much on commercial allies in Asia, the United 
States, and Europe.  Bachelet saw the UNASUR meeting for the 
Bolivia conflict as Chile's chance to get involved in a 
constructive way in the region. (NOTE: Vio was Ambassador to 
Venezuela during the Lagos administration but was recalled 
for consultations for three months as a result of tense 
relations between Venezuela and Chile. He is strongly 
anti-Chavez and considers himself close to Lagos and Frey but 
does not know Bachelet; Vio was concerned about where 
Bachelet could take Chile's relationship with Chavez given 
her leftist origins. END NOTE). 
 
¶2. (C) Vio told the Ambassador that he spoke with President 
Lugo's Chief of Staff, Miguel Angel Lopez Perito, and 
Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) Senator Alberto Grillon 
(chair of the Paraguayan Senate Foreign Affairs Committee) 
the day before they traveled with Lugo to Chile.  Vio 
stressed the need to keep the United States out of the UNASUR 
declaration; all agreed that the UNASUR declaration should 
not be anti-U.S.  Vio said Lugo held that line during the 
UNASUR meeting, and that Chilean MFA staff were relieved that 
UNASUR agreed on a declaration given the high risk associated 
with the meeting. 
 
¶3. (C) Ambassador met separately with Senator Grillon 
September 18 upon his return from Chile.  Grillon said 
Colombian President Uribe played a key role in moderating 
UNASUR discussions about Bolivia, and that Argentine 
President Kirchner and Brazilian President Lula (who does not 
want the Venezuela/Bolivia issue to spill over into Brazil) 
were also ""helpful.""  Grillon said Chavez gave a long-winded 
speech attacking the United States -- to the annoyance of 
most of the other heads of state -- and that only Bolivian 
President Morales echoed his rhetoric.  Grillon said Morales 
spoke disparagingly about Ambassador Goldberg, alleging that 
he contributed to the crisis because of his meetings with the 
opposition and ""interference.""  Lugo's participation was 
limited, but his interventions moderate, according to 
Grillon.  Sen. Grillon overhead one of Chavez' advisors press 
Lopez Perito not to accept President Bush's invitation for a 
White House meeting with Lugo.  The Venezuelan advisor 
aggressively tried to convince Lopez Perito that the 
Bush/Lugo visit should not take place.  Lopez Perito 
disagreed. 
 
¶4. (C)  President Lugo told the Ambassador September 19 that 
he wants to talk to all sides in the Bolivian conflict, and 
that he has reached out to the political opposition in 
Bolivia directly.  He confided in the Ambassador, saying that 
he believes Morales ""has a complex"" about race and dismissing 
Chavez' recent rhetoric.  COMMENT: Lugo continues to walk a 
fine, pragmatic line on regional politics.  In the press, he 
has been very balanced on the Bolivia crisis, supporting 
Morales as Bolivia's democratically elected president but 
avoiding any mention of the United States. On September 24, 
Lugo publicly stated that he will not expel any ambassadors 
from Paraguay, including the current U.S. Ambassador. 
Simultaneously he stated that ""Lugo is not Hugo Chavez and 
Hugo Chavez is not Lugo, thank God."" END COMMENT.
