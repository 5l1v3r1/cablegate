SUBJECT: "URGENT" WORRIES FROM UKRAINE FINANCE MINISTRY 
 
REF: KYIV 2102 
 
Classified By: Economic Counselor Edward Kaska for Reasons 1.4 (b) and 
(d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Ukrainian Deputy Minister of Finance Andriy Kravets 
notified the embassy on December 11 that Foreign Minister 
Poroshenko was planning today to ask IMF first deputy 
managing director John Lipsky to consider including Ukraine 
on the agenda of the next IMF board meeting.  Poroshenko had 
received direct instructions from Prime Minister Tymoshenko, 
after acting Minister of Finance Umanskiy briefed her on 
Deputy Prime Minister Nemyria's December 6 meetings in 
Washington (reftel).  Kravets characterized Poroshenko's 
message as "extremely urgent" and expressed hope that Ukraine 
"still had a chance" to get an IMF disbursement before the 
end of 2009. 
 
¶2.  (C) Kravets stated that the Ministry of Finance had 
already begun to roll out Plan B: a three-part auction of 
domestic treasury bills.  The Deputy Finance Minister said 
auctions would take place on December 15, 22, and 29.  The 
first auction would be the bellwether for market interest on 
the Ministry of Finance's initial offer of 12-month t-bills 
at a rate of 20-25%.  Higher yield debt issuances, such as in 
the "extremely difficult" month of October (when the GOU sold 
UAH 4.3 billion or $540 million in t-bills for near 30%) were 
"unacceptable" and would "destroy" the domestic market. 
 
¶3.  (C) The likely purchasers of GOU debt were banks with 
foreign capital.  Kravets listed Raiffeisen-Aval, Erste, 
Ukrsotsbank (UniCredit), ING, Ukrsibbank (BNP Paribas), and 
Citi as interested parties.  The Ministry of Finance was 
readying a scheme to name primary dealers that would be 
launched after the December auctions. 
 
¶4.  (C) Kravets expressed concern that, if Ukraine did not 
access IMF financing or successfully auction domestic 
t-bills, Ukraine's budget situation would be "disastrous". 
The Ministry of Finance also needed to roll over UAH 2 
billion ($250 million) in internal debt.  Failure to do so 
could "provoke" an external default, according to Kravets, 
who did not elaborate on how this would occur. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Deputy Minister Kravets was harried and anxious when 
explaining the GOU's predicament to Econoff.  He did not ask 
for specific USG intervention with the IMF, but mentioned 
that the Prime Minister had been "grateful" for recent 
meetings between Poroshenko, Nemyria and USG officials in 
Washington.  Kravets' mention of a possible external default 
scenario, which would be triggered by a default on domestic 
debt, was the first the embassy had heard of such grave and 
immediate GOU concerns.
