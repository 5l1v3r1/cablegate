SUMMARY 
-------- 

¶1. (C) The Government of Colombia (GOC) maintains positive 
relations with Israel, particularly in the defense sector 
through private Israeli defense contractors.  Key areas of 
cooperation include strategic military advice, special forces 
training, and arms sales in support of Colombia's battle 
against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ("FARC"). 
Economic relations between the two countries outside of 
defense cooperation remain relatively limited.  Colombia's 
Jewish community remains small, with only approximately 4,000 
members.  End Summary. 
 
MILITARY COOPERATION 
-------------------- 

¶2. (S/NF) Colombia's defense cooperation with Israel cooled 
during the 1980s and 1990s, when some Israeli mercenaries 
reportedly helped train paramilitary forces in Colombia. 
More recently, the GOC has engaged former Israeli military 
officials to help provide training and advice in the fight 
against the FARC and other terrorist groups.  A contact 
within the Colombian Ministry of Defense (MOD) told us that 
this new relationship dates back to December 2006.  Over the 
last two years, Embassy officers visiting the MOD and 
Colombian military have observed an increased presence of 
Israeli advisors. 
 
¶3. (S) Israeli contractors support the GOC through arms 
sales, military training, and the provision of strategic 
military planning and consulting services.  The GOC has also 
engaged Israeli contractors to train Colombian special 
forces, particularly related to high value targets (HVTs). 
In 2005 and 2006, there was significant frustration among 
senior Colombian military leadership related to a poor 
success rate in killing or capturing HVTs.  The GOC 
subsequently contracted retired and active duty Israel 
Defense Force officers with special operations and military 
intelligence backgrounds to help in this regard.  Israeli 
contractors have also made recommendations to the GOC on 
military purchases, joint military operations, and how to 
restructure Colombia's intelligence services. 
 
THE "STRATEGIC LEAP" 
-------------------- 

¶4. (S/NF) Colombia's Ministry of Defense (MOD) has also 
engaged an Israeli company, Global Comprehensive Security 
Transformation (Global CST), to help the Colombian government 
conduct a strategic assessment of the internal conflict. 
Global CST is a security company run by Major Gen (reserve) 
Yisrael Ziv, former Director of Operations for the Israel 
Defense Forces and a personal acquaintance of Colombian 
Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos.  The assessment is 
focused primarily on defeating the FARC and other internal 
terrorist and criminal organizations, but also includes an 
evaluation of external threats including Venezuela and 
Ecuador.  The MOD is spearheading the exercise and has named 
it the "Salto Estrategico" (Strategic Leap). 
 
ARMS SALES 
---------- 

¶5. (C) In February 2008, the GOC signed a deal with the 
Israeli government to update 24 Kfir C7s to the C10 version. 
The GOC is negotiating a possible USD 160 million avionics 
upgrade contract with the Israel state-owned company Israel 
Aircraft Industries, Ltd. (IAI).  The IAI contract would 
involve a complete revamping of Colombia's aging Mirage 5 and 
Kfir fighter aircraft.  The GOC is also negotiating the 
possible purchase of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from 
IAI, with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) 
capabilities.  A consortium including IAI is also bidding on 
the sale of naval frigates to the GOC.  According to an 
internal MOD document, roughly 38% (606,773 million Colombian 
pesos) of the GOC's foreign defense purchases went to Israel 
in 2007.  The GOC arms purchases from Israel have not led to 
direct or indirect GOC support to Israel in other political 
or economic areas, such as countering Iran, or in supporting 
Israeli positions at the United Nations. 
 
COLOMBIA'S JEWISH COMMUNITY 
--------------------------- 

¶6. (C) The Jewish community in Colombia is concentrated in 
Bogota, with smaller communities in Cali, Barranquilla and 
Medellin.  The Confederation of Associations of Bogota 
represents the Ashkenazi, Sephardic and German Jewish 
communities in the country, and there are some nine 
synagogues in Colombia.  In the mid-1990s, the Jewish 
community was estimated to be around 5,500, although many 
Jews subsequently left due to violence and economic 
instability.  An estimated 4,000 Jews currently reside in 
Colombia.  There are no indications that Colombia's foreign 
policy interests are shaped by the country's Jewish 
community. 
 
ECONOMIC RELATIONS 
------------------ 

¶7. (C) Israel's economic relations with Colombia remain 
relatively limited.  Colombian exports to Israel fell 17 
percent from 2005 to 2007, dropping from USD 197 million to 
USD 164 million.  During the same period, Colombian imports 
rose 60 percent, increasing from USD 99 million to USD 161 
million.  Israel ranked as Colombia's 26th largest trading 
partner in 2007.  Over 88 percent of Colombian exports to 
Israel in 2007 consisted of minerals or hydrocarbons.  The 
majority of Colombian imports from Israel in 2007 were 
divided among the following sectors: arms and ammunition (28 
percent); electrical machinery (25 percent); and 
non-electrical machinery including boilers (11 percent). 
While precise country of origin data for foreign direct 
investment (FDI) is difficult to confirm, Israel has not been 
a significant source of FDI in Colombia in recent years. 
 
¶8. (S) A previous, comprehensive report prepared by DIA on 
relations between Israel and Colombia is being sent to INR 
via e-mail.
