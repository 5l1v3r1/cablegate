SUBJECT: ARAMCO CONSULTANT DOUBTS ARAMCO CAN MOVE PAST 12.5 
MILLION BARRELS PER DAY 
 
 
Classified by Consul General John Kincannon for reason 1.4 
(d). 
 
¶1.  (C) An American expatriate who is a senior consultant to 
Saudi Aramco on oil drilling operations told the CG recently 
that he doubted Aramco would be able to develop a maximum 
sustainable oil production capacity (MSC) "much beyond" 12.5 
million barrels per day after 2009.  (Note:  Aramco's current 
plan is to reach an MSC of 12.5 million barrels per day, 
including production from the Neutral Zone, by the end of 
¶2009.  End note.)  The consultant based his argument on two 
related points:  falling production in mature fields and the 
scarcity of trained personnel, rigs, and materiel.  The 
consultant believed Aramco could reach an MSC of 12.5 million 
barrels per day but did not think it would have the "oomph" 
to move beyond that number in the further "out years." 
(Comment:  As a counterargument to this consultant's 
assessment, Aramco's plan to develop the Manifa field is 
clearly intended to move production past the 12.5 million 
target.  End comment.) 
 
¶2.  (C) Comment and bio note:  The consultant is on his 
second tour with Aramco, the first being during the 1980s 
when he was seconded to Aramco from his then parent company, 
a U.S. petroleum major.  He has more than twenty years of 
industry experience.  While we cannot evaluate the merit of 
his assessment, he seems to have enough industry knowledge 
and access to technical data to be in a position to make a 
reasoned assessment.  Post notes that there is no firm 
consensus among industry experts on whether Aramco could move 
to an MSC greater than 12.5 million barrels per day after 
¶2009.  Post plans to continue to explore this question on a 
low-key basis with Aramco expatriates in similar positions to 
see if there is a trend in their assessments.  End comment 
and bio note.
