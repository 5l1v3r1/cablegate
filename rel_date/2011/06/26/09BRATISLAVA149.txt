¶1. (U) The Slovak Government last night announced that it had 
concluded the buyback of its 49 percent share in the 
Transpetrol oil pipeline at a cost of $240 million.  The 
purchase from Yukos Finance, one of the remnants of bankrupt 
Yukos Oil, was finalized and signed on March 26 in London 
between Minister of Economy Lubomir Jahnatek and former CFO 
of Yukos Bruce Misamore.  The Transpetrol pipeline connects 
the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline with Slovak and 
Czech markets, each of which uses about 50 percent of the oil 
shipped. 
 
¶2. (C) The USG has on numerous occasions expressed concern 
about the rumored intention of the GoS to re-sell the 49 
percent share--or perhaps the entire company--to Russian oil 
interests, and Yukos had attempted to insert a limitation 
into the sale agreement.  In the end, there was no 
restriction on the Slovaks' ability to re-sell the line, but 
at the press conference announcing the deal, Jahnatek said 
again what he has told us many times: that Slovakia intends 
to hold and operate the pipeline.  We have queried his 
ministry on several occasions about its plans for operating 
the line, and have received credible answers suggesting it 
intends to operate it indefinitely. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT: The buyback of Transpetrol at last untangles 
a complicated legal situation caused by the bankruptcy of 
Yukos Oil.  Whether the GoS can manage the line effectively 
is a concern for local energy analysts, who fear that the 
line will be badly run by the notoriously ineffective 
Ministry of Economy.  Perhaps the bigger concern, though, is 
what the Fico Government will do with the revenue.  This is 
not a new problem (the GoS receives 51 percent of revenue 
currently), but the stakes have just gone up. Rather than 
going through the National Property Fund, revenues will now 
flow through the Ministry of Economy, which has shown itself 
to be less than a model of transparency and probity.
