¶1. (C) At their July 28 meeting, Ambassador Vallee and 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Kubis discussed next steps 
for the Slovak government in the Transpetrol situation. 
Ambassador Vallee emphasized that the impending sale of Yukos 
shares in Transpetrol needs to be carried out in a 
transparent manner that reflects market forces, and 
questioned whether GOS approval of a possible deal between 
Yukos and Gazprom would meet that criteria.  The Ambassador 
expressed concern that, in his July 27 meeting with Minister 
of Economy Lubomir Jahnatek, the new Minister had shown 
considerable trepidation about offending Russian business 
interests (see reftel).  The Ambassador stressed that 
Slovakia maintains significant leverage due to its veto 
authority over Yukos sales, the Russian court's lack of 
jurisdiction over Yukos Finance, and other factors. 
 
¶2. (C) In response, Kubis emphasized that Slovakia's top 
priority in this process would be regaining management 
control of Transpetrol.  Currently Slovakia owns 51 percent 
of Transpetrol shares, but Yukos holds management control. 
He said that Yukos Finance had shown no willingness to sell 
back its shares to Slovakia, so the GOS had to look for the 
next best solution.  (Comment: We are not sure of the basis 
for this belief.  Though his opinion was firm, Kubis admitted 
at the same time that he is not an energy expert. End 
Comment.)  Kubis lamented that Slovakia's veto authority over 
any possible sale of Yukos shares runs out on May 1, 2007, so 
it would be necessary to finalize a solution before then. 
While concerned about the loss of veto power next year, Kubis 
did not, however, fully share Jahnatek's view that Slovakia 
absolutely needed to strike a deal before Yukos liquidation 
proceedings begin in early August. 
 
¶3. (C) Minister Kubis said that he thought Gazprom could be 
convinced to grant management authority to the GOS as part of 
a deal, and believed that the Russians would fulfill their 
contractual obligations.  Kubis added that a sale to the 
Polish firm PERN or another firm is still a viable option if 
Slovakia would gain management control of Transpetrol in the 
process.  The Minister noted that the EU wanted Slovakia to 
buy back its shares from Yukos, but said that it was not 
realistic to expect Slovakia to stand up to Russia on energy 
contracts when all other EU members had failed to do so.
