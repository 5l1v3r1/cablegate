¶1. (C) Summary: Italian energy company ENI is seeking at 
least tacit USG approval for a memorandum of understanding 
that it wishes to sign with Iran.  The MOU would be for a 
feasibility study to increase oil production from the 
Darquain field. ENI's CEO Paolo Scaroni will raise this issue 
with USG officials during a visit to Washington in the next 
few weeks. Scaroni sought USG approval for a similar MOU last 
year.  A firm negative response from Washington stopped that 
initiative. ENI clearly wants to expand its operations in 
Iran, and given the change in U.S. Administrations, wishes to 
see if it can elicit a positive reaction from Washington on 
this oil MOU. End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) ENI,s Diplomatic Advisor Vincenzo De Luca and head of 
Public Affairs Leonardo Bellodi called on Post on April 28 to 
discuss the company's plans to sign an oil MOU with Iran. 
Bellodi said such an agreement will allow ENI to conduct a 
feasibility study for expanded development of the Darquain 
oil field from which the company obtains the majority of its 
Iran oil production. Bellodi told us that ENI wants to expand 
oil production from this field in order to increase the 
recovery of its prior investments (Note: The Iranians are 
apparently paying ENI in oil for work that ENI did on Iran,s 
energy export infrastructure some years ago. Further, 
according to ENI's Fact Book, its total 2008 Iran oil 
production averaged 28 kbbl/d. Its main producing fields are 
South Pars phases 4 and 5 and the Darquain field, with the 
latter accounting for 91 percent of ENI's production in Iran. 
End note). 
 
¶3. ( C ) De Luca stressed that while ENI will not undertake 
new projects in Iran until a change in the political 
situation allows it, the company will continue to honor its 
existing contracts there.  With regards to these, he added 
that ENI's key interest is to recover the investments the 
company has made. In this respect, De Luca said ENI does not 
see anything wrong with going forward with the proposed MOU 
as it believes that it fits in the framework of fulfilling 
its existing contracts in Iran.  He clarified that the 
company intends for the MOU to be signed by its country 
representative in Iran, but acknowledged our concerns that 
Iran would use the occasion as another propaganda opportunity. 
 
¶4. (C) Although ENI reps said the company is not under 
pressure from Iran to sign such an MOU, De Luca stated that 
ENI believes its interest in protecting its investments will 
not be taken seriously by Iran if it does not conduct more 
development activities of the Darquain field.  He added that 
German and French energy companies' activities with Iran are 
more aggressive than ENI's, and that this is also putting 
pressure on the company.  De Luca shared with Econ Offs an 
April 27, 2009 press article in which a senior official from 
Iran,s Continental Shelf Oil Company announced the signing 
of a 32 million Euro agreement with French Total on the Dorud 
oil field. According to the article, the agreement would 
ensure operational support and production at this field by 
Total.  De Luca portrayed ENI as the most consistent of 
European countries in terms of keeping a low profile in Iran. 
In contrast, he highlighted recent visits there by high level 
German and French officials, and said Germany had approved 30 
million Euros in export insurance credits for its domestic 
companies doing business with Iran. 
 
¶5. (C) De Luca and Bellodi stressed the company,s 
willingness to be transparent and to keep the USG appraised 
of its intentions with Iran. As an example, they noted that 
while ENI was interested in Iran's South Pars 19, 20, and 21 
blocks, it desisted after CEO's Scaroni's May 2008 trip to 
Washington revealed USG opposition (Ref D).  De Luca said ENI 
would now like to schedule a follow-up visit to Washington to 
more directly discuss its plans for the MOU and its broader 
activities in Iran.  He explained the company is 
contemplating a pre-visit by himself and Bellodi for senior 
working-level meetings with the USG, to be followed by a 
visit by CEO Scaroni for more high-level discussions. De Luca 
asked for Post's advice on this approach and for confirmation 
of dates. He said that, if possible, ENI is interested on a 
trip to Washington as early as the week of May 11 but no 
later than June 18. 
 
¶6. (C) Comment: Post thinks there are good reasons for USG 
skepticism on this request. ENI has been anxious to expand 
its Iran operations for many years and would probably portray 
any positive reaction from Washington as a green light for 
expansion. Scaroni visits Washington each spring in an effort 
to gauge USG sentiment about his company,s relationships 
with its problematic partners in Iran and Russia. (See 
Reftels). Last year, Scaroni got a very firm negative 
response from Under-Secretaries Jeffery and Levey.  This 
year, ENI appears to be hoping to get a different response 
from the new administration. Given USG plans to try a new 
approach with Iran, ENI may believe that there is room to 
maneuver. Post reminded ENI of ongoing international efforts 
to pressure the Iranian regime to suspend its nuclear 
enrichment program, and we noted that the Iranians would 
likely seize on any MOU with ENI as additional evidence that 
the pressure has subsided and that business as usual is 
proceeding. 
 
¶7. (C) Comment continued. ENI's actions also contradict its 
"official position" that it does not plan to undertake new 
projects in Iran.  Per reftel A, one of its subsidiaries 
(Polimer Europa) has a part in a bigger contract to build an 
Iranian petrochemicals plant. Just four weeks ago we 
demarched ENI on this specific contract and told the company 
of continued USG opposition to such new deals with Iran 
(reftel B).  We have not heard from ENI that Polimer Europa 
will give up its Iranian contract.  In addition, its 2008 
Fact Book states that it is already undertaking additional 
development of the Darquain field. It describes upgrading 
activities of this field such as drilling of additional wells 
and gas injection with the aim of increasing production from 
100 kbbl/d to 160 kbbl/d (14 kbbl/d accrue to ENI).  Despite 
ENI's portrayal of its proposed MOU as linked to prior Iran 
investments, it smells, walks and quacks like a new project. 
End comment.
