for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
(C) PolCouns delivered reftel demarche to the MFA's Director 
of Multilateral Affairs Gustavo Alvarez on February 23 and 
raised the issue again with Director General for Political 				
Affairs Bruno Faraone on February 24. Faraone indicated that 				
the GOU had received no request to meet with Hamas 				
representatives and was unlikely to entertain such a request 				
if presented.  Nevertheless, he said, the ""West"" bore a 				
responsibility in the victory of Hamas in the recent 				
Palestinian Legislative Council elections since the lack of 				
hope and slow progress in peace negotiations with Israel only 				
strengthened the hand of radicals. Faraone did not elaborate 				
on the Quartet's conditions for dealing with Hamas.  He said 				
that Uruguay remains firm in its support for Israel, but that 				
it would be ""unfortunate"" if Hamas became ""isolated"" by the 				
international community and forced to seek alliances only 				
with radical actors such as Iran.
