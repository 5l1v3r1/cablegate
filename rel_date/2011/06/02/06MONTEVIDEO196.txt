for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (S/NF) PolCouns delivered reftel demarche to the MFA's 
Director General for Political Affairs Ambassador Bruno 
Faraone on February 24.  After discussing some of the items 
on the list, Faraone said weapons donations were not 
possible, but that he would look into the ""feasibility"" of 
donating locally-manufactured water purification units known 
as ""UPAs.""  He said that it would take some time to evaluate 
if such a donation was possible, particularly because of the 
Carnaval holidays on February 27 and 28.  Faraone personally 
doubted that Uruguay would have the funds to transport items 
such as water purification units to either Iraq or 
Afghanistan.  He also commented that the GOU was generally 
more inclined to help Afghanistan security forces rather than 
Iraqi ones since it considered the Iraqi intervention to be 
a mistake."" 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
¶2. (S/NF) Uruguay previously donated two UPAs for Iraq that 
were subsequently destroyed in a ground attack by insurgents. 
 The GOU appears to be unaware that that the units were 
destroyed.  Uruguay also offered UPAs to assist the city of 
New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.  In that 
instance, Uruguay did not have the funds to ship the UPAs to 
New Orleans and the donation was not accepted.  End Comment.
