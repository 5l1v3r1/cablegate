SUBJECT: PROGRESS WITH EGYPT ON NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION 
ISSUES? 
 
REF: 09 TEL AVIV 2757 
 
Classified By: Ambassador James B. Cunningham, reasons 1.4 (b),(d) 
 
¶1. (S) On December 31, National Security Advisor Uzi Arad 
told the Ambassador that on the margins of PM Netanyahu's 
December 29 visit to Cairo, Arad discussed with FM Abul Gheit 
Egypt's on-going attempts to inject Israel into various 
nuclear discussions and fora.  Arad described a very candid 
discussion in which he argued that what Egypt is doing has no 
effect on Israel in real terms, while real world 
proliferation trends are negative.  Egyptian sniping at 
Israel creates tension in their relationship, Arad said -- 
but more importantly, distracts attention from genuine issues 
of concern (i.e., Iran) to all in the region. 
 
¶2. (S) Arad also argued that going down the path of pursuing 
a Middle East Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (NWFZ) will require 
taking a critical look at what Syria, Iran, Libya, and even 
Egypt itself are doing in the nuclear field.  He assured Abul 
Gheit that Israel, in the long term, supports a genuine NWFZ 
and that should be an ultimate goal. 
 
¶3. (S) According to Arad, Abul Gheit responded that the 
Israeli ambassador in Vienna should seek out his Egyptian 
counterpart, and that there should be discussions between 
capitals "to see what we can do" to find common ground while 
showing movement toward addressing the issue.  Arad took this 
as a positive step, and said PM Netanyahu had approved the 
proposed discussions in Vienna.
