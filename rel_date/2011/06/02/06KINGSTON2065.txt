SUBJECT: JAMAICA: GOVERNMENT DEFEATS NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION 
 
REF: KINGSTON 2020 
 
Classified By: Charge d'affaires, a.i. James T. Heg for Reasons 1.4 (b) 
 and (d). 
 
¶1.  (U) On October 17, Parliament debated for eight hours a 
no-confidence motion brought by Bruce Golding, leader of the 
opposition Jamaica Labor Party (JLP), against the ruling 
People's National Party (PNP), in response to the controversy 
surrounding the USD 500K in political funding donated to the 
PNP by Dutch oil trader Trafigura (reftel).  The motion was 
defeated, as expected, by a vote of 33 to 23, with Members of 
Parliament (MPs) voting strictly along party lines. 
 
¶2. (U) Golding opened the debate and stated that the 
opposition believes that the Trafigura controversy is enough 
to cause the country to loose confidence in PSM and her 
government.  Golding suggested that the USD 500K "gift" from 
Trafigura was carried out in a clandestine and surreptitious 
manner and that the entire affair was sleazy and incestuous. 
Golding argued that respectable democracies hold their 
governments accountable and respectable Parliaments secure 
that accountability. 
 
¶3. (U) Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller (PSM) spoke 
during the debate; however, rather than addressing the issue 
head on, she charged that the no-confidence motion had been 
brought to deflect attention from a censure motion against 
JLP MP Karl Samuda brought by the newly appointed Minister of 
Information and Development, Donald Buchanan.  Buchanan 
replaced Colin Campbell as Information and Development 
Minister last week after Campbell resigned due to the fall 
out over the Trafigura scandal. 
 
¶4. (C) On October 18, PolOff spoke to JLP Member of 
Parliament James Robertson regarding the aftermath of the 
no-confidence vote.  Robertson stated that the PNP had 
"weathered the storm," but that the invincibility of PSM has 
cracked.  Robertson also stated that he thought his party 
should have focused their attack on Philip Paulwell, Minister 
of Industry, Technology, Energy and Commerce, rather than on 
PSM since there was no way that the "most popular prime 
minister in Jamaican history was going down, but the PNP may 
have given up Paulwell."  According to Robertson, the 
earliest that he predicts elections will be called is June 
2007 after Cricket World Cup. 
 
¶5. (C) Comment: No information has yet surfaced to directly 
implicate PSM in the scandal.  The JLP will certainly try to 
keep the issue on the front-burner.  It has knocked PSM's 
march to a likely victory this fall in early elections off 
stride.  The Prime Minister now, baring any further 
revelations, will likely choose to delay elections and allow 
this scandal to blow over and be forgotten by Jamaican 
voters, as so many have in the past.  End Comment.
