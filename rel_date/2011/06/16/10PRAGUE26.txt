¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarches on January 19 and 20 
to Foreign Ministry Humanitarian Aid Department Officer Hana 
Volna, who is leading government coordination efforts. She 
reported that the Czech Government has pledged CZK 20 million 
(USD 1.1 million) to the international Haiti relief effort. 
The first CZK 5 million (USD 276,243) has already been 
transferred to UNICEF for immediate assistance, and the 
remaining CZK 15 million (USD 828,729) will be administered 
through humanitarian channels yet to be determined. The Czech 
government hopes to send a government representative to Haiti 
in the coming weeks to assess the best way to administer the 
funds. 
 
¶2. (U) Media sources report that the City of Prague hopes to 
contribute an additional CZK 12 million (USD 662,983), though 
it has thus far approved only CZK 2 million (USD 110,497). 
In addition, Volna estimates that Czech NGOs and private 
sector contributions total roughly CZK 15 million (USD 
828,729).  This number will increase as major non-profit 
organizations announce new fundraising events and efforts 
every day. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Czech media also reports that the government is 
considering sending to Haiti medical teams, military police, 
and biological teams to detect contaminated drinking water. 
Volna said, however, that she had reached out to U.S. airport 
coordination personnel and that congestion at Haiti's airport 
has hindered efforts to send on-the-ground support so far. 
 
Media Coverage: 
-------------- 

¶4. (U) Post has not found any ill-informed or distorted 
perspectives in Czech media coverage of the earthquake in 
Haiti.  Rather, the Czech press had been well-informed and 
balanced, especially in regards to coverage of U.S. 
assistance efforts.  In particular, opinion pieces both on 
television and in print have criticized the remarks of the 
French Minister of Foreign Affairs as well as the efforts of 
the EU.  For example, Milan Vodicka stated in today's edition 
of Mlada Fronta Dnes that the EU response is a disgrace 
because "while the U.S. sent an aircraft carrier, the EU, the 
wannabe superpower, organizes meetings in Brussels." 
 
¶5. (U) Last Thursday, Post began featuring various IIP 
products on Haiti on our websites and Facebook page, with 
appropriate updates that will continue for the foreseeable 
future.  Also, PAS is arranging an upcoming interview for 
Polec Officer Darian Arky, who had served in Haiti and speaks 
fluent Czech.
