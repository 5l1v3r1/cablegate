¶1.  SUMMARY:  On May 11, a magnitude 4.3 earthquake shook 
Port-au-Prince, followed by aftershocks in subsequent days. 
The epicenter of the earthquake was 5 miles south of the 
center of Port-au-Prince.  There were no reported injuries 
and only very minor damage.  Haiti has suffered from 
earthquakes in the past and two fault lines traverse the 
country, one in the north and one in the south.  A more 
severe earthquake would be catastrophic, as the government 
of Haiti is unprepared to handle a natural disaster of any 
magnitude.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  On May 11, at 2058 local time, a magnitude 4.3 
earthquake shook Port-au-Prince.  The epicenter of the 
earthquake was 5 miles south of the center of Port-au- 
Prince.  There were no reported injuries and only very minor 
damage to the capital city.  In the days following the 
earthquake, Port-au-Prince has felt aftershocks, most 
notably on May 14 at approximately 1900, May 23 at 
approximately 0300 and May 23 at approximately 1445. 
 
¶3.  Historically, Haiti has suffered from a number of 
earthquakes, including one in 1770 that destroyed Port-au- 
Prince and one in 1842 that caused extensive damage in 
northern Haiti and killed thousands.  Two major fault lines 
cross the country, one in the north and one in the south: 
the southern fault line cuts through the southern part of 
Port-au-Prince.  Earthquake experts consider both faults 
quite dangerous.  The northern fault, in particular, has not 
released significant energy in over 800 years.  According to 
experts, approximately 4 to 8 meters of left lateral 
slippage has already accumulated and should it be released, 
could register 8.0 or higher on the Richter scale, with no 
forewarning.  The soil conditions in Haiti are such that an 
earthquake anywhere in the country could cause severe 
liquefaction, whereby soil is turned to a quicksand type 
liquid, which is a considerable threat to infrastructure 
such as buildings, dams, bridges and highways. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  The last thing Haiti needs now is an 
earthquake.  Compounding problems of political instability, 
poverty and environmental degradation, the flooding last 
September in Gonaives caused by Tropical Storm Jeanne 
demonstrated how unprepared the Interim Government of Haiti 
is to handle a natural disaster.  A severe earthquake would 
be catastrophic.  On OFDA team will come to Port-au-Prince 
in June to help the embassy coordinate its disaster 
preparations, and to try to jump-start IGOH and donor 
coordination and planning. END COMMENT.
