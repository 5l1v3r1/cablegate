SUBJECT: Jamaica:  ICE launches of Operation JOLT to target lottery 
scammers 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (U) Jamaica -- May 27-28, the Charg d'Affairs and ICE Attach 
opened the first JOLT Task Force joint training session and 
operation - that's the Jamaica Operations Linked to Telemarketing. 
In 2008, it is estimated that more than USD 30 million was 
transferred to Jamaica by victims of the lottery scam.  By COB May 
28, the joint U.S-Jamaican teams had arrested 12, seized evidence, 
including victims list and several vehicles, including one stolen 
from the U.S.  End Summary. 
 
Lottery Scam 
------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) In January 2008, relying on our strong bi-national 
relationship, the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) requested assistance 
from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office at 
the embassy to fight this new crime wave.  In April, 2008, a 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was executed between DHS-ICE and 
the Jamaica Constabulary Force to establish JOLT.  JOLT is a joint 
ICE - GOJ (JCF, Jamaica Customs, the Passport Immigration and 
Citizenship Agency, the Director of Public Prosecution office, the 
Magistrate Court of Montego Bay, and the Financial Investigative 
Division of the Ministry of Finance) program.  All activities, 
including the posting of ICE special agents and analysts dedicated 
to JOLT, are being funded directly by ICE. 
 
¶3. (U) This new Jamaican project is based on a successful ICE 
program operating in Canada since 1998 which has so far recovered 
more than USD 14 million dollars to U.S. and Canadian victims of 
telemarketing fraud.  This Canadian operation has also resulted in 
26 U.S. Grand Jury indictments and 161 U.S. and Canada-based 
arrests. 
 
Training Session 
----------------- 
 
¶4. (U) After the Opening Ceremony concluded, 22 trainers consisting 
of U.S. ICE special agents, members of the State of Minnesota 
Department of Public Safety Fraud Squad, the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC), and Western Union Corporate Security began a 
day-long operational training program.  The 28 trainees present were 
from the JCF, Jamaica Customs, the Passport Immigration and 
Citizenship Agency, the Director of Public Prosecution office, the 
Magistrate Court of Montego Bay, and the Financial Investigative 
Division of the Ministry of Finance. 
 
Operation 
--------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) At 5:30 am May 28, the first official JOLT operation in 
Montego Bay commenced, the nexus of the Jamaican lottery scam.  When 
the operation ended, joint ICE /JCF teams had executed 9 search 
warrants, made 12 arrests and collected a considerable amount of 
evidence.  During the raid, one suspect ate his cell phone sim card 
as the JOLT team entered.  The team was also able to seize pages and 
pages of victims' names.  A film crew from ABC's Nightline 
accompanied the JOLT team and was able to film the operation as it 
progressed.  In addition to the computers, vehicles and other 
evidence seized, the JOLT team recovered fake DHS letterhead used by 
the scammers to convince victims that their winnings are legit.
