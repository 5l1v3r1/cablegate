SUBJECT: LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT FROM PRIME MINISTER BRUCE 
GOLDING 
 
¶1. (SBU) Under cover of the following Government of Jamaica 
Diplomatic Note No. 5/504/1 of April 6, post has received the 
below letter from Prime Minister Bruce Golding addressed to

(Begin Text of Diplomatic Note) 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade presents 
its compliments to the Embassy of the United States of 
America and has the honour to transmit hereto, copy of a 
letter from the Prime Minister of Jamaica, the Honourable 
Bruce Golding, M.P., to the President of the United States of 
America, Mr. Barack H. Obama. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade avails 
itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the 
United States of America, the assurances of its highest 
consideration.

(Begin text of letter to the President) 
 
Dear Mr. President: 
 
I commend you on the decisive action you have taken in 
collaboration with the Mexican Government to confront the 
drug cartels and to eliminate the threat they pose to the 
security of both the United States and Mexico. The government 
of Jamaica supports the efforts being made by the United 
States through the Merida Initiative to combat drug 
trafficking through Mexico and Central America. 
 
I further welcome your recent statement that the United 
States will intensify its efforts to control the flow of 
illegal guns and cash from the United States to drug cartels. 
 
Jamaica remains extremely vulnerable to the predatory 
activities of these criminal networks. As an island state 
located along a major route between the source and 
destination of illicit drugs and faced with severe resource 
constraints, our surveillance, investigation and apprehension 
capabilities are not commensurate with the threats to which 
we are exposed. 
 
We appreciate the assistance and cooperation which the US 
authorities have provided us. However, our counter-narcotics 
activities need to be strengthened and intensified. 
 
I urge you, notwithstanding the emphasis justifiably placed 
on the Mexican border, to consider expanding the initiative 
to incorporate the Western Caribbean and, in particular, 
Jamaica, the Bahamas, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. 
 
Jamaica remains fully committed to cooperating with the 
United States in repelling this grave threat to both our 
countries. 
 
Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
Bruce Golding, MP 
Prime Minister
