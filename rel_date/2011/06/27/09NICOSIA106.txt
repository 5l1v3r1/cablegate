REF: NICOSIA 104 AND OTHERS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Frank C. Urbancic, Reasons 1.4 (b), (d) 
 
¶1.  (U) Status of Vessel:  No changes since last report 
(Reftel). 
 
¶2.  (S) Diplomatic Activity:  Ambassador at 1130 hrs local 
(0430 DC) on February 6 telephoned Presidential Diplomatic 
Coordinator Leonidas Pantelides for further clarity on 
Pantelides's day-earlier suggestion that the RoC transport 
the M/V Monchegorsk's cargo to Malta for safe-keeping, 
storage, and/or eventual disposition (Reftel).  While he had 
not yet received formal instructions from Washington to 
support the initiative, the Ambassador noted that he had not 
heard objections, either.  Above all, the United States' 
primary goal was to block the export of Iranian munitions.  A 
response from the Iran Sanctions Committee to Cyprus's letter 
would be coming soon, Ambassador added, and Cyprus needed to 
take action.  Pantelides was more blunt than usual in 
replying.  "Cyprus will not be able to withstand the pressure 
much longer, and has to find a way out," he claimed, noting 
that Monchegorsk stories were now dominating local media. 
The Ambassador inferred that the RoC would act very quickly 
once the Sanctions Committee letter arrived, perhaps even 
over the weekend. 
 
¶3.  (S) In response to the Ambassador's query, Pantelides 
revealed that Cyprus had not yet put the plan to Malta for 
consideration.  Later today he intended to flesh out the 
proposal, obtain President Demetris Christofias's support for 
it, and, if he received a green light, approach the Maltese 
directly.  The RoC did not/not want the U.S. to intervene 
with Valletta first, he stressed.  Ambassador agreed the U.S. 
would not contact the Maltese, but restated the U.S. offer to 
help with disposition of the goods, both diplomatically and 
technically.  As usual Pantelides demurred, but promised to 
brief the Ambassador after his imminent conversation with the 
President. 
 
¶4.  (S) The Ambassador later briefed UK High Commissioner 
Peter Millett on the Pantelides call.  Millett reported that 
the Cypriots had not raised the Malta option in earlier 
conversations, but he saw value in exploring the proposal. 
The two islands were members of the Commonwealth and European 
Union and shared a common (and perhaps paranoid) worldview. 
They worked well together, even recently signing an agreement 
to provide joint diplomatic and consular services from their 
respective missions.  Further, Millett observed, Malta likely 
would be receptive to EU support for this type of solution to 
a UN resolution violation.  It would take some effort to 
convince the Maltese it was in their own self-interest to 
take the Monchegorsk burden off Cyprus, he concluded.  That 
said, there were no apparent Syrian pressure points on Malta, 
unlike on Cyprus. 
 
¶5.  (S) Following up the morning conversation and in response 
to recent EUCOM reporting that the Monchegorsk might be 
weighing anchor, Ambassador telephoned Pantelides at 1545 
hrs.  Could we expect developments over the weekend? he 
inquired.  Pantelides guaranteed that the vessel would not 
depart Cypriot waters.  In another seeming about-face, he 
added that, "if we decide to unload the cargo, the ship will 
go to Larnaca (another Cypriot port 40 miles NE of Limassol). 
 We can deal with it better there."  (Comment: it could be 
that pressure in New York and Brussels has left Cyprus 
reconsidering its formerly dead-set opposition to bringing 
the haul on land.)  The Palace diplomat did not offer further 
details on the Malta arrangement nor a readout of his meeting 
with Christofias, however. 
 
¶6.  (S) Ambassador also engaged French Ambassador Nicolas 
Galey on February 6.  Galey reported tremendous European 
Union pressure on Cyprus in recent days regarding the 
Monchegorsk matter.  Cyprus had obligations to the EU to 
prevent the illegal export and could not stand on the excuse 
that action on the Monchegorsk had moved to New York. 
Further, Galey reported, member states had warned Cyprus the cargo could not be returned to Iran.  Galey claimed he was 
recommending a joint demarche in Nicosia with the P-3 plus 
Czechs and Germans.  He also would recommend a joint demarche 
in Damascus.  The United States likely would want to 
participate in Nicosia, the Ambassador responded, suggesting 
the target be President Christofias himself.  He also stated 
that Washington likely would provide just about anything 
necessary to ensure the cargo did not make it to Syria. 
"That takes away the Cypriot argument that they don't have 
the technical capacity to deal with the cargo," Galey 
responded.
