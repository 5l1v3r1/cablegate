SUBJECT: PERU LOWERS TARIFFS AGAIN, UNILATERALLY 
 
 
¶1.  Summary: The Government of Peru (GOP) unilaterally lowered its 
tariffs again, to a 5.8 percent average tariff, from the previous 
8.0 percent and over 60 percent in the mid-1990s.  The GOP will 
likely continue this trend, reinforced by the prospect of 
ratification of the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA), and 
prospective FTA talks with Canada, the EU, China, and Singapore. 
This tariff measure on capital goods, agricultural, construction, 
industrial, transportation, and consumer products is, like the 
previous measures, proof of the GOP's commitment to its "apertura 
commercial".  The government's main motivation is to improve 
resource allocation and competitiveness in consumer spending. But it 
also hopes the increased imports would reduce the appreciation 
pressure on the Nuevo Sol against the depreciating U.S. dollar. 
Imports reached US$1.8 billion, continuing a 44 month positive flow. 
Polls show strong support among consumers and business for these 
reductions, though some local industries have expressed concern over 
specific products, notably cement.  End Summary. 
 
ZERO DUTIES ON ALMOST HALF OF TARIFF LINES 
------------------------------------------ 

¶2.  The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) announced on October 
13, 2007, reductions in tariffs for 4,148 Customs codes out of a 
7,351 total codes in its Tariff Schedule, or 56 percent of its 
Tariff Schedule.  As a result, Peru now imposes no duties on 48.5 
percent (3,568 codes) of the items in its tariff schedule, covering 
some intermediate agricultural goods, parts, and capital goods not 
produced locally, liquefied petroleum gas, non-locally-produced 
capital goods, intermediate goods, parts, wheat and wheat flour.  It 
is important to note that these items represent 62.51 percent of 
Peru's imports in 2006. 
 
¶3. The current four-tier duty structure includes a 9 percent duty, 
applied on 37.0 percent (2,718) of the Customs codes, mainly 
consumer goods; some locally produced capital goods; intermediate 
goods; some pork meats; some corn, barley, and malt products; 
preparations for child food products; beer; and liquor.  In 
addition, a 17 percent duty is applicable on 14.3 percent of import 
items (1,052 codes), covering mostly textiles; footwear; household 
electrical products; coffee; and some other agricultural products; 
and a 20 percent duty on 0.2 percent of the items (13 codes) 
covering bovine meats and their derivatives. 
 
LOWERING PRICES FOR CONSUMERS 
----------------------------- 

¶4. The mean tariff is now 5.8 percent, down from 8.0 percent, while 
the weighted average (using 2006 imports) is 2.3 percent compared 
with 3.8 percent.  The Minister of Economy and Finance Luis Carranza 
noted that the reduction in tariffs of food products, inputs and 
capital goods will directly impact the consumer price of these 
products, resulting in increased competitiveness for Peru's economy, 
productivity increase and general wellbeing, while hoping that the 
increased imports would alleviate the strength of the Nuevo Sol 
against the U.S. dollar.  The 25 percent duty on 62 codes has been 
eliminated. 
 
 
POLLS SHOW STRONG SUPPORT FOR TARIFF REDUCTION 
--------------------------------------------- - 

¶5.  The most recent poll conducted by El Comercio, national 
newspaper, indicates that the Peruvian population favors a reduction 
in tariffs and taxes on imports.  Specifically, the results of the 
poll show approximately 69 percent of those polled support a 
reduction for wheat, rice, and sugar; 61 percent support a reduction 
for clothes; and, 63 percent support a reduction in domestic 
electronics.  The National Confederation of Private Business 
Associations (CONFIEP) supports the reduction in tariffs; however, 
the association questions the manner in which the GOP has announced 
the tariff reductions.  CONFIEP criticizes the GOP for taking 
action, figuratively, "in the middle of the night."  CONFIEP has 
also voiced concern regarding the reduction of cement to 0 percent. 
Another major business chamber, the Foreign Trade Society of Peru 
(COMEXPERU) strongly supported the GOP's action.  Most local 
economists polled by the local news also voiced support for the 
reductions. 
 
CRITICS:  LOW COST CEMENT FROM COLOMBIA? 
---------------------------------------- 

¶6. Two major business chambers, the National Society of 
Manufacturing Industries (SNI) and the Exporters Association (ADEX), 
strongly opposed the tariffs reduction, and called upon the GOP to 
reconsider the measure.  The SNI president went as far as to state 
that, if the measure is not revoked, the manufacturing industries 
labor force would decrease by 6 percent and it's GDP by 15 percent 
in 2008. Observers say the SNI's main objection is also the prospect 
of imported low price cement from Mexico through Colombia.  With 
Peru's construction boom in full swing, economists note that the 
foreign competition could kill local cement manufacturers' chances 
of windfall profits. Other more minor problems are specific textile 
lines. 
 
IMPORTS INCREASE AT RECORD RATES 
-------------------------------- 

¶7.  Foreign purchases continue to increase in Peru, up overall to 
41.3 percent in September.  Imports of capital goods and 
construction materials lead at 59.0 percent, followed by raw 
materials and intermediate products at 36.1 percent and finally 
consumer products at 29.2 percent.  In September, imports of 
industrial capital goods such as telephones, industrial machinery, 
and parts/accessories, increased by 56.8 percent and for 
agricultural capital goods, such as tractors, brooders, shovels by 
57.9 percent.  Raw materials and intermediate products included 
mostly minerals, wheat, yellow maize, and non-food farm products and 
chemical products for the textile sector, paper and cardboard. 
Under consumer products the 29.2 percent increased can be divided in 
between durable (31%) and non-durable goods (27.9%).  Durable goods 
included mostly new vehicles and televisions from Mexico and China. 
In the transportation sector, imports have increased by 77 percent 
for commercial vehicles. 
 
U.S. DOLLAR CONTINUES TO DECLINE AGAINST SOL 
-------------------------------------------- 

¶8. The U.S dollar continues to weaken against the Peruvian Nuevo 
Sol.  Over the past year the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar 
and the Nuevo Sol has decreased from 3.25 in October 2006 to nearly 
3.017 in October 2007.  Just during the month of September the U.S. 
dollar has depreciated from 3.172 Nuevo Soles to almost 3.017 as of 
October 4.  This rate of exchange reaches levels similar to those of 
August 1998.  The Central Reserve Bank continues to intervene 
heavily in the local exchange market to support the dollar.  The 
bank has purchased nearly $6.46 billion so far this year. 
 
COMMENT: PERU OPENS TO GLOBAL ECONOMY 
------------------------------------- 

¶9. The Garcia Administration entered office in June 2006 with the 
unstated goal to continue President Toledo's policy to make Peru a 
more competitive nation in the international economy.  The GOP's 
economic team's pursuit of this goal is reflected in their policies 
to further reduce tariff rates and pursue trade agreements with 
numerous foreign governments including Canada, China, European 
Union, Mexico, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States.  The 
current policies show how far Peru has come in the last two decades; 
a country that for twenty years had an economy reaching only 20 
percent of the international market.  Today, the rate is about 50 
percent, but the goal, as delivered in a public message by Economy 
Minister Luis Carranza, is to reach 70-80 percent of the 
international market by the end of Garcia's term.
