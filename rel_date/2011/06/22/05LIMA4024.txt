(SBU) D/Polcouns presented the demarche seeking support for 
EU3 efforts to report Iran to the UNSC (Reftel) to Foreign 
Ministry Multilateral Political Affairs Director Julio Garro 
on 9/16.  Garro said he had been told that Deputy Secretary 
Zoellick was extremely persuasive on 9/15 when discussing 
with President Toledo the need to pressure Iran on compliance 
with IAEA resolutions.  Garro added that Peru was in the 
process of paying its arrears so that it would regain the 
right to vote within the IAEA.  Once Peru gets back its 
voting privileges, he expected that the GOP would stake out a 
position in support of the USG viewpoint regarding Iran.
