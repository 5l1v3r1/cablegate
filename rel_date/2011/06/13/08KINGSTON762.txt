¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  ACTION REQUEST:  THIS CABLE REQUESTS IMMEDIATE 
ADVICE ON A FUNDING CITATIONS FOR USD 100,000 TO BE AVAILABLE TO 
SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT OF JAMAICA'S OFFICE OF DISASTER PREPAREDNESS 
AND NON PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT EFFORTS TO 
ASSESS AND RESPOND TO DAMAGE SUSTAINED DURING TROPICAL STORM GUSTAV. 
 END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U) AT 12:30 HOURS ON AUGUST 28, 2008, TROPICAL STORM GUSTAV MADE 
LANDFALL IN THE EAST OF JAMAICA. THE STORM FOLLOWED A PATH THAT 
CARRIED IT ALONG THE SOUTHERN PARISHES OF JAMAICA CAUSING 
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO INFRASTRUCTURE AND FLOODING TO VARIOUS 
COMMUNITIES LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE ISLAND.  FOUR PARISHES ST. 
THOMAS, ST. CATHERINE, PORTLAND AND ST. MARY ARE THE WORST AFFECTED. 
ELEVEN PEOPLE ARE REPORTED MISSING AND FOUR PEOPLE ARE CONFIRMED 
DEAD.  APPROXIMATELY 4,000 PERSONS HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY 
THE STORM, 120 ROADS ARE IMPASSABLE BEING BLOCKED BY DEBRIS OR ARE 
FLOODED.  65 PERCENT OF THE WATER SUPPLY HAS BEEN AFFECTED AS A 
RESULT OF TURBIDITY, BLOCKAGE, FLOODING OR LACK OF POWER.  STORM 
WIND DAMAGE AFFECTED ALMOST HALF OF THE ELECTRICAL GRID IN THE 
COUNTRY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) GOJ EFFORTS:  ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF JAMAICA IS 
HESITANT TO DECLARE A NATIONAL DISASTER, IT IS WILLING TO ACCEPT USG 
ASSISTANCE.  THE GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE OFFICE OF DISASTER 
PREPAREDNESS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (ODPEM), HAS MADE AN APPEAL 
REQUESTING RELIEF SUPPLIES TO ASSIST THE INMEDIATE HUMANITARIAN 
NEEDS OF THE AFFECTED POPULATION.  ODPEM IS ACTIVELY CARRYING OUT 
DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS ACROSS THE ISLAND, AND POTENTIAL POST RECOVERY 
ASSISTANCE IN REBUILDING LOST INFRASTRUCE WILL BE NEEDED. IT SHOULD 
BE NOTED THAT THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR HAS SUFFERED HEAVY LOSSES AND 
POST RECOVERY SUPPORT SHOULD CONSIDER ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESSING CROP 
DAMAGE AND LIVELIHOODS. 
 
¶4.  (U) INTERNATIONAL DONOR ASSISTANCE:  A UNDP EMERGENCY 
COORDINATION GROUP HAS MET WITH ODPEM FOR SPECIFIC REQUESTS OF 
ASSISTANCE. COORDINATIONS ARE BEING MADE AS TO MINIMIZE DUPLICATION 
OF EFFORTS, MORE INFORMATION TO FOLLOW. 
 
¶5.  (U) MS. AUDREY MULLINGS, THE USAID/OFDA DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT 
SPECIALIST CONSULTANT HAS CONDUCTED AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE OF THE 
AFFECTED AREA AND WILL PROVIDE SPECIFIC DETAILS OF DAMAGE AT A LATER 
TIME.  MR. SIDNEY VELADO, OFDA REGIONAL ADVISOR HAS ARRIVED TO 
SUPPORT THE MISSION TO DEVELOP A HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE TO THE DAMAGE 
SUSTAINED DURING THE TROPICAL STORM. 
 
¶6.  (U) BECAUSE OF THE EXTENT OF DAMAGE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE 
AMBASSADOR HAS MADE A DETERMINATION THAT THE DISASTER IS OF 
SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE TO MERIT A DISASTER DECLARATION AND THAT IT IS 
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE USG TO RESPOND.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
USAID DISASTER GUIDANCE (STATE 205089) AND POST'S DISASTER RELIEF 
PLAN, AMBASSADOR JOHNSON REQUESTS USD 50,000 AS PER AMBASSADOR'S 
AUTHORITY AND AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION OF USD 50,000 AS PER 
USAID/OFDA REGIONAL ADVISOR'S RECOMMENDATION. THE FUNDS WILL BE USED 
TO PROVIDE ODPEM WITH AERIAL OVERFLIGHT SUPPORT AND FOR HUMANITARIAN 
RELIEF SUPPLIES TO BE DISTRIBUTED EITHER THROUGH ODPEM OR NON PROFIT 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
¶7.  (U) THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO REPORTS OF U.S. CITIZENS' INJURIES 
AND DEATHS. 
 
¶8. (U) SEAN OSNER IS THE MISSION DISASTER RELIEF OFFICER.  HIS PHONE 
NUMBER IS 011-383-8905. 
 
¶9.  (U) ACTION REQUESTED:  PLEASE ADVISE FUNDING CITATION BY 
IMMEDIATE CABLE. 
 
¶10. (U) FURTHER SITREPS WILL FOLLOW.
