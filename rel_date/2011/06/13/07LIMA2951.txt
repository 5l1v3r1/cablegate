¶1.  (U) Summary.  On August 29, U.S. Ambassador McKinley and a team 
of representatives from the U.S. Embassy in Lima, USAID/Peru, and 
USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) 
traveled to Pisco Province to visit earthquake-affected areas.  The 
Ambassador visited Pisco's downtown area and the Nueva Alameda 
sector, as well as San Andres and San Clemente districts.  The 
Ambassador also met with General Luis Felipe Palomino, Director of 
the Government of Peru's (GOP) National Civil Defense Institute 
(INDECI), and visited INDECI's warehouses at the Peruvian Air Force 
base in Pisco.  During the visit, Ambassador McKinley had the 
opportunity to show three GOP Ministers the general medicine 
services provided by the Department of Defense's (DOD) Medical 
Readiness Exercise Team (MEDRETE) in the displaced persons camp in 
Nueva Alameda. 
 
¶2.  (U) Ambassador McKinley and the U.S. Embassy and USAID team 
found that the main challenges to the ongoing response remain camp 
management, the provision of shelter, and local authorities' 
capacity to provide assistance effectively.  Throughout the visit, 
residents expressed gratitude to Ambassador McKinley for the 
assistance and support provided by the USG and Americans in response 
to the earthquake.  End summary.

Visit of INDECI's Warehouse 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) General Palomino received Ambassador McKinley and the U.S. 
Embassy and USAID team at the Peruvian Air Force base.  General 
Palomino accompanied the team in a tour of INDECI's two warehouses 
on the base, where relief items are received by air and dispatched 
for delivery to affected populations.  (Note:  A separate warehouse 
in the port of Pisco houses shipments of relief supplies arriving by 
sea.  End note.)  Since August 18, the American private company DHL, 
which was later joined by Procter and Gamble, has supported INDECI's 
warehouse operations.  DHL's Disaster Response Team, which provided 
logistics assistance during the Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane 
Katrina disasters in recent years, has improved the warehouses' 
organization and is training INDECI's staff to run operations. 
Prior to DHL's arrival, INDECI and the Peruvian Military ran the 
warehouses.  Because the local government structure was 
significantly impacted by the earthquake, distribution of relief 
supplies during the initial days was weak.  Disorganization, among 
other things, prevented INDECI from determining and informing local 
authorities and relief agencies of the availability of supplies. 
With DHL's assistance, relief items are now organized by type and 
INDECI is able to provide accurate information on stocks of items 
such as rice, milk, fortified biscuits, tuna, and mattresses, which 
are most needed by the affected population.

Pisco District

¶4.  (SBU) During a meeting with Ambassador McKinley, the mayor of 
Pisco, Juan Mendoza Uribe, noteOGKFQZ}Q/7xuComment: 
INDECI and Pisco's mayor have had confrontations during the past few 
days.  The confrontations stem from INDECI's request that the mayor 
provide information about needed relief items and distribution 
targets prior to INDECI dispatches.  The issue of how many tents are 
still needed Zontinues to be contentious.  While tents have been 
distributed to affected families, not all are of the appropriate 
quality, and, in some cases, two and three families are living in 
one tent.  IOM plans to distribute 12,000 tents, of which 6,000 are 
scheduled to arrive during th%oD52_QQuZL{W,.e Charity of St. 
Vincent of Pau are registering people sleeping in the open in Pisco 
District and providing them with tents and blankets.  According to 
the mayor, fuel for heavy machinery currently used for debris 
removal is running out and the district might lose some vehicles for 
cleanup operations as private companies begin to scale down their 
response to the emergency.  Mayor Mendoza Uribe expressed gratitude 
for the international assistance that has arrived to date in Peru. 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Ambassador also met with representatives of a group of 
Peruvian, Brazilian, and American private companies - including Peru 
LNG, Odebrecht, Chicago Bridge and Iron Company - that are providing 
heavy machinery and personnel to remove rubble in Pisco District. 
In coordination with district authorities and the Bank of Materials 
(Banmat), a national institur_~&LQ\QiQQQ^Qn#7QQf6J5Y
