¶1.  (C) Summary: The Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
convoked more than 15 diplomatic missions on October 12 to 
request international financial assistance to remove 29,000 
anti-personal mines from Peru's border with Ecuador.  GOP 
officials outlined the history of demining operations in 
Peru, underscored the close cooperation taking place with 
Ecuador, and detailed the obstacles facing military engineers 
working in the demining zone.  The Peruvian Ministry of 
Defense provided a detailed request for international 
assistance for 2008, totaling USD 1.1 million.  The meeting 
left most observers convinced of the GOP's commitment to 
clearing mines and its willingness to work with the 
government of Ecuador to ensure the success of the program, 
but some diplomats privately questioned the GOP's ability to 
complete a long-term project that has run into difficulties 
in the past.  End Summary 
 
------------------- 
Demining Background 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Gonzalo Gutierrez 
and Vice Minister of Defense Fabian Novak chaired a meeting 
of more than 15 diplomatic missions, including the OAS, 
European Commission, and Embassy of Ecuador, on October 12 to 
request financial assistance for Peruvian demining 
operations.  The GOP plans by 2019 to remove 29,000 
anti-personal mines located in the province of Condorcanqui 
(Amazonas department) in an area of approximately 22,000 
square meters.  The army of Peru placed the mines after its 
brief 1995 conflict with Ecuador.  Seventeen indigenous 
communities in both Ecuador and Peru, with a total population 
of 2,000 persons, live close to the hazardous zone.  Although 
statistics are incomplete, the GOP estimates that since 1999, 
300 Peruvian soldiers and civilians have suffered injuries 
from mines, with at least one fatality.  Sixty Peruvian 
soldiers, in the 116th and 111th Engineer Companies of the 
Peruvian Army, currently perform the mine clearing. 
 
------------------------ 
Cooperation with Ecuador 
------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In 1998, Peru and Ecuador signed a peace treaty 
ending the 1995 conflict, and in 2001 both governments signed 
separate agreements with the OAS for coordinating 
international support for demining; in 2006, the OAS combined 
both programs under a single coordinator.  Peru and Ecuador 
began simultaneous demining in October 2006, and in July 
2007, signed a protocol that created a bilateral medical 
evacuation plan, established periodic exchanges of 
information, allowed transfers of equipment between demining 
teams, and authorized joint training. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) At the October 12 demining meeting, the OAS 
permanent representative to Peru, Bertha Sajntoscoy, called 
cooperation between the two governments "unprecedented." 
Ecuadorian Ambassador Diego Ribadeneira said this cooperation 
goes beyond efforts to remove mines and includes plans to 
bring economic development, environmental protections, and 
physical security to rural peoples often ignored by central 
governments in the past.  Vice Minister Gutierrez called the 
demining program a litmus test for both governments to show 
that democracies are capable of protecting and caring for 
citizens on the social margins. 
 
--------------------- 
Obstacles to Demining 
--------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) MOD officials detailed the challenges facing 
military engineers working in  Condorcanqui, including 
isolation -- the closest military base is a day's journey 
away -- discarded ordinance left from the 1995 conflict, 
 
faulty mine detectors, irregular terrain covered by thick 
vegetation, and bad weather.  The bad weather often restricts 
demining operations to less than four hours of work per day, 
because international norms require that helicopter Medevac 
routes remain open while soldiers are in the field.  The July 
2007 agreement with Ecuador gave Peruvian troops access to 
Ecuadorian trauma centers, reducing helicopter flight times 
from 4 hours 30 minutes to 2 hours 30 minutes, but heavy 
rains and dense cloud cover frequently ground flights. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The most pressing problem is funding.  The EC 
provided the GOP 500,000 euros to fund mine clearing from 
March 2006 to June 2007.  That money has been spent, and no 
additional EC monies are available.  The GOP needs 20 million 
soles (approximately USD 7 million) to support mine clearing 
through 2019, with 1.1 million required in 2008.  The bulk of 
that money will go for personnel costs (USD 440,000), 
administration and supervision (USD 420,000), and logistical 
support (USD 210,000).  The remaining line items cover victim 
assistance for residents of the area (USD 40,000) and 
equipment costs (USD 20,000).

¶7.  (C) The GOP pulled out all the stops in underscoring its 
commitment to demining, with Vice Minister Gutierrez, 
Permanent Resident Sajntoscoy, and Ambassador Ribadeneira 
reading from the same script in extolling Peruvian and 
Ecuadorian cooperation.  Still, questions remain.  Only the 
Embassy of Italy offered to help close the budget gap -- 
without offering specifics -- and some US observers noted 
that previous Peruvian demining efforts had gone nowhere. 
Nevertheless, Peru has succeeded in drawing closer to Ecuador 
on a number of issues (see reftel), and senior GOP officials 
have given demining top priority.  We believe the issue 
warrants renewed USG attention and are working with the 
Political-Military Bureau to arrange a Humanitarian Demining 
Assistance Team visit to Peru early December to assess the 
GOP's commitment and requirements for its demining program.
