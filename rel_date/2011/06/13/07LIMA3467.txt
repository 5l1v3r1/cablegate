SUBJECT: PERU WILL PARTICIPATE IN WIREC 2008 ENERGY 
CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 138428 
 
¶1.  Per reftel, Econoff invited the Government of Peru, 
through the MFA, to send an official delegation to the March 
2008 Washington International Renewable Energy Conference 
(WIREC).  Econoff provided details on the event, the website 
link, and an explanation of the ministerial-level nature of 
the event.  On October 11, Carlos Briceno of the MFA's North 
America Office replied that Peru would participate, but that 
it was too early to know who would lead the delegation.  He 
suggested the formal invitation be sent to Minister for 
Foreign Relations Jose Antonio Garcia Belaunde.  The GOP 
would then reply at a later date as to the head and 
composition of its delegation. 
 
¶2.  Renewable energy issues are at the forefront of GOP 
concerns at the moment.  The GOP official most involved in 
these issues is Vice Minister of Energy Pedro Gamio, of the 
Mining and Energy Ministry (MEM).  Peru's current renewable 
energy projects include biofuels, hydro energy, solar energy, 
and wind energy.  The GOP has specifically requested USG 
assistance in developing a biofuels industry.
