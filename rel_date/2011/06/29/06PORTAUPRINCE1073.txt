SUBJECT: POLICE CHIEF ANDRESOL NOMINATED FOR THREE MORE 
YEARS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Janet Sanderson for reason 1.4(b). 
 
¶1.  (C) President Preval on June 15 announced the nomination 
of current Haitian National Police (HNP) Director General 
Mario Andresol to continue in his position for three more 
years.  The Senate must now approve the nomination by 
majority vote.  The justice and security committee will begin 
examination of his nomination in the coming week.  Andresol 
may face some scrutiny from senate President Joseph Lambert 
and justice and security committee President Youri Latortue, 
both of whom are widely believed to be involved in illegal 
activities.  Bolstered by Preval's direct support, however, 
we expect Andresol to gain Senate approval. 
 
¶2. (C) Since replacing Leon Charles as DG in summer, Andresol 
has gained the respect of rich and poor alike, as he has 
attempted to root out corruption within the force, improve 
performance, and combat a wave of kidnapping that peaked at 
the end of 2005, but shows signs of resurging.     Andresol 
enjoys the confidence of Robert Manuel, Preval's closest 
advisor on police and security matters, and Rene Momplaisir, 
Preval's liaison to the poor masses -- and almost certainly 
at least some gang leaders -- in Cite Soleil.   In 
cooperation with MINUSTAH political and disarmament 
officials, Andresol has also quietly entertained feelers from 
several gang leaders in Cite Soleil and other poor 
neighborhoods, notably Amaral Duclonat, who have expressed 
interest in some kind of truce with the HNP.  Andresol also 
collaborated closely with UNPol commissioner Graham Muir in 
repairing the damage over MINUSTAH's release of an HNP reform 
plan Haitians regarded as infringement on their sovereignty, 
and redrafting a reform program that will lead to productive 
cooperation with UNPol and far-reaching HNP reform. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment.  Preval's nomination of Andresol is a 
significant step forward.  Andresol has not only promoted 
honesty and integrity within the HNP, but has undertaken 
significant iniiatives, such as the draft HNP rform plan 
with MINUSTAH, that would have almost ertainly come grinding 
to a halt without his contnued leadership.  We look forward 
to maintainingour own close bi-lateral cooperation through 
himand expanding overall multi-lateral coordination as we 
intensify our efforts to rebuild the HNP.
