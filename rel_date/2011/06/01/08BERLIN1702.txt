¶1.  (SBU) On December 22, 2008, Econoff spoke with Christiane 
Botschen, Deputy Head of Division for Mexico, Central America 
& Caribbean, German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to urge host 
country suspension of assistance to Nicaragua following the 
fraudulent November 9 municipal elections.  Having frozen 
budgetary aid a year ago, Germany is in broad agreement with 
U.S. imperatives regarding the suspension of assistance to 
Nicaragua, reported Botschen.  Germany is a member of the 
International Donors Group and is also the head of the 
Elections Group, she said, which issued a separate statement 
critical of the November 9 elections.  Botschen said the 
European Union (EU) was likewise engaged on the issue.  EU 
Commissioner for External Relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner 
recently sent a letter to Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Samuel 
Santos Lopez informing him the EU Commission would suspend 
assistance as of 2009, according to Botschen. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Botschen noted Germany had not drawn a direct link 
between assistance to Nicaragua and the November 9 elections 
in its communications with the Nicaraguan government. 
Rather, Germany's statements emphasized the need for 
adherence to "democratic principles."  Germany is in 
"constant talks" with the government of Nicaragua concerning 
the need for democratic reform, she commented.  Botschen 
confided, however, she was not optimistic at this point.
