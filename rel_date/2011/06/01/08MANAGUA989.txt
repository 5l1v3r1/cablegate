ORCHESTRATED VIOLENCE? 
 
REF: A. MANAGUA 982

Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d). 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY: Partisan violence erupted on the afternoon 
of July 30, 2008 resulting in gunshots and a wound to the leg 
of pro-Sandinista Channel 4 News reporter, Antenor Pena 
Solano.  Edgardo Cuarzema, the local-level Political 
Secretary for the Sandinista national Liberation Front (FSLN) 
and leader of the FSLN group at the incident, immediately 
blamed the three other news agencies present, although other 
observers claim that Cuaresma's group of Sandinista followers 
initiated the clash. This incident closely parallels recent 
beatings of Liberal supporters and candidates that took place 
over the weekend (REF A) and suggests diminishing FSLN 
tolerance for opposition electioneering. END SUMMARY 
 
DEMONSTRATION "A LA SANDINISTA" 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At 3pm on July 30, 2008 Sandinista enthusiasts -- 
some identified as members of the Sandinista Youth group -- 
armed with rocks, sticks and alcoholic beverages, guarded 
several of the hundreds of the billboards lining Managua's 
streets that display Ortega's image. They awaited a youth 
group, "Puente" that was scheduled to protest the excessive 
use of State funds for such publicity by chaining themselves 
to a billboard in the Rotunda "Ruben Dario" that same 
afternoon.  Before the altercation, the leader of the group, 
Victor Cienfuegos (a long-time FSLN street agitator), told 
the press "today we are here because they said that (Puente 
members) are going to chain themselves to the billboards. We 
don't think that is appropriate . . . we will not permit it." 
 According to the press, when Puente members saw the group of 
Sandinistas, they moved their protest to another location to 
avoid violence. Later, vehicles arrived carrying Puente 
supporters from the Managua suburb of Cuidad Sandino, led by 
missionary priest Alberto Boschi.  The FSLN group "welcomed" 
them by hurling rocks, apparently damaging two police patrol 
cars in the process. When officers attempted to apprehend an 
individual, they were rushed by the rest of FSLN crowd and 
shots were fired.  Press reports claim that a reporter from 
Channel 4 news -- owned by President Ortega's son -- was 
injured by a gunshot. However, doctors at the military 
hospital that treated him reported no gunpowder residue, 
burns or broken bones, the usual evidence of such a wound. 
 
¶3.  (C) Commissioner Palacios of the Nicaraguan National 
Police (NNP), dismissed any police involvement in the 
shooting, telling us that police covering riots use AK-47s 
and shotguns, not the pistol that was apparently discharged. 
A different contact at NNP noted an emergency call was placed 
to cover the protest and so police arrived without their 
usual riot gear. (Note: there is a picture in the paper and 
television footage of a police officer pointing a pistol in 
the air. End note). Another officer told us that the wound 
might actually have resulted from a stabbing. 
 
THE BLAME GAME 
- - - - - - - - 
 
¶4.  (C)  Arriving on the scene just after the incident, 
Edgardo Cuarzema, local-level Political Secretary for the 
FSLN, accused the three other news agencies present of 
provoking the violence.  Later, Channel 4 blamed nearly all 
FSLN opposition -- political opposition groups Vamos Con 
Eduardo (VCE) and the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS); 
daily newspapers La Prensa and El Nuevo Diario; the 
left-of-center civil society group Coordinadora Civil; Manuel 
Guillen, La Prensa's satirical cartoonist; and Jaime 
Arrellano, a local, liberal, talk show host --telling viewers 
that "it (the aggression) was a cowardly action taken by the 
Right." However, VCE representatives have told us that none 
of their supporters were present; they were planning on 
participating later that evening and insinuated that the 
violence, gunshots and possibly the injury were staged. Hugo 
Torres, spokesperson for the MRS, informed us that when 
 
Boschi's van arrived, they mistook the Sandinista group for 
MRS as some were wearing orange shirts (MRS colors) and 
waving Nicaraguan flags. They contend the FSLN group stoned 
their van and when the priest complained to the police, 
mayhem ensued. Other news sources also blame the Sandinista 
group -- purported members of the Citizen Power Councils 
(CPC's) -- for instigating the violence. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5.  (C) Yesterday's scuffle typifies the rising tensions 
between political parties and Ortega's diminishing tolerance 
for opposition.  The FSLN appears willing to use supporters 
to intimidate peaceful opposition demonstrations; and the 
Sandinista press, to stoke political animosity and blame the 
government's primary media adversaries.  As elections near, 
Ortega's government is apparently replacing more subtle 
efforts to suppress the media (REF B) with verbal and legal 
attacks, coupled with outright physical attacks on protesters.
