SUBJECT: AUSTRIAN VIEW OF NICARAGUAN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 122262 
 
Classified by: Economic-Political Counselor J. Dean Yap for 
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Polchief discussed reftel points November 20 with 
Andreas Melan, MFA Unit Chief for Latin America and the 
Caribbean.  Melan agreed that the Nicaraguan municipal 
elections did not meet international standards.  He said the 
declining democratic standards in Nicaragua have been an 
increasing concern for the EU; the current French term 
presidency has consistently included Nicaragua on the agenda 
in EU fora.  Melan said a number of EU states that were 
providing budget support to the Nicaraguan government have 
recently reduced or frozen their assistance because the 
government has failed to adequately account for the funds. 
The GOA, by contrast, provides development assistance 
directly to local governments and NGOs in Nicaragua, and 
continues to be able to monitor those programs thoroughly, he 
said. 
 
¶2. (C) Nevertheless, the EU has not yet addressed the issue 
of the November 9 elections.  When it does, the GOA would 
support a strong message criticizing the election 
irregularities, he said.  Melan questioned, however, whether 
it would make sense to call for a recount.  Noting that the 
Nicaraguan government had already recounted the Managua vote, 
he averred that any official recount would only confirm the 
results of the flawed election.
