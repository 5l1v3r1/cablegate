¶1.  (C/NF)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS THEIR 
APPRECIATION FOR POST'S REPORTING FOLLOWING THE DISSIDENT 
REPUBLICAN ATTACKS IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND LEADING UP TO THE 
ST. PATRICK'S DAY SUMMIT AT THE WHITE HOUSE.  POST'S 
IMPRESSIVE NUMBER OF REFS PROVIDED ANALYSTS EXCELLENT INSIGHT 
INTO THE PERSPECTIVES OF PROVINCIAL POLITICAL FIGURES ON 
IMPORTANT ISSUES, SUCH AS THE DEVOLUTION OF POLICING AND 
JUSTICE. REFS WERE FEATURED PROMINENTLY IN FINISHED PRODUCTS 
ON THE ATTACKS AND IN BRIEFINGS TO SENIOR POLICYMAKERS. 
POST'S INSIGHTS INTO THE ASSESSMENTS OF POLICE SERVICE OF 
NORTHERN IRELAND (PSNI) LEADERS WAS PARTICULARLY HELPFUL AS 
ANALYSTS EXAMINED THE EFFORTS OF THESE OFFICIALS TO PREVENT 
FUTURE ATTACKS AND UNREST. 
 
¶2.  (C/NF)  ANALYSTS WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION 
POST CAN PROVIDE ON PSNI, BRITISH MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE, 
AND GARDA EFFORTS TO COMBAT DISSIDENT REPUBLICAN GROUPS AND 
PREVENT RETALIATION BY LOYALISTS. ANALYSTS ARE ALSO 
INTERESTED IN ANY FUTURE INSIGHTS INTO THE DUP'S AND SINN 
FEIN'S NEGOTIATIONS ON THE DEVOLUTION OF POLICING AND 
JUSTICE.  MANY THANKS AND KUDOS.
