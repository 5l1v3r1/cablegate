SUBJECT: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS SECRET TAIWAN PAYMENTS TO 
EX-PRESIDENT ALEMAN (C-AL5-01181) 
 
REF: STATE 6661 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR PAUL TRIVELLI. REASONS 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1. (C) On January 25, poloff and RLA met Attorney General for 
Criminal Affairs Ivan Lara and Economic Crimes investigator 
Mario Diaz of the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) to discuss 
Taiwan's use of foreign aid funds in Nicaragua in recent 
years.  Lara and Diaz did not have any evidence of Taiwanese 
payments to individual politicians since the Bolanos 
administration took office in January 2002, but they do have 
evidence of such payments to ex-President Arnoldo Aleman in 
2000-2001. 
 
¶2. (C) Diaz told emboffs that credible sources have told the 
NNP that the Government of Taiwan paid 6 million USD to 
ex-president Arnoldo Aleman in 2000 in return for Nicaraguan 
promotion of Taiwanese membership in the United Nations. 
According to the NNP's sources, 2 million USD was given 
directly to Aleman in cash, while 4 million USD was channeled 
through U.S. banks (mostly Citibank in New York) and then 
into the accounts of the Nicaraguan Democratic Foundation 
(FDN) in Panama, the same private account through which 
Aleman funneled most of the stolen GON funds in his various 
money laundering schemes.  Once funds (whether from Taiwan or 
the GON treasury) went into the FDN account, Aleman and his 
associates then transferred them into the accounts of 
Panamanian shell companies they had established for the sole 
purpose of further laundering the funds.  Diaz noted that 
Aleman's father-in-law (and partner in his money laundering 
schemes), Jose Antonio Flores Lovo, was the Nicaraguan consul 
in New York (and substitute Nicaraguan ambassador to the 
U.N.), at the time, and the NNP believes that Flores Lovo 
played some part in facilitating transfer of the Taiwanese 
money to Aleman. 
 
¶3. (C) Lara added that his office has documentation of at 
least some of the Taiwanese transfers into the FDN account. 
Financial routing documents provided to the GON by the 
government of Panama show that between June 2000 and October 
2001, at least 1.5 million USD was transferred from Taiwanese 
banks into the FDN account.  The transaction records list 
such names as "Fortuna Co., Ltd.", "Honguo Co., Ltd.", and 
"Wei Keh Wu" as the companies or persons paying money into 
the FDN account.  Lara told emboffs that the GON was never 
sure whether all these names represented companies or 
individuals, and they could not document that the government 
of Taiwan was the original source of the funds. 
 
¶4. (C)  In order to investigate the transactions further, in 
2003, the GON, through its Embassy in Taipei, sent a formal 
diplomatic request to the GOT to investigate the questionable 
transactions and provide the GON information on the sources 
of the money.  According to Lara, as of January 2006, the GON 
has never received any Taiwanese reply to its request for 
information, despite multiple follow-up requests.  The lack 
of a response from Taipei, combined with the circumstantial 
evidence and the information given to the NNP by its sources, 
leads Lara to conclude that Taiwan was indeed the source of 
the payments to Aleman.  Lara believes that the Taiwanese 
"companies" listed on the transaction documents were simply 
dummy companies of the same sort that Aleman set up in Panama 
and elsewhere to disguise all of his illicit transactions. 
Lara provided emboffs copies of several of the documents 
showing transactions from Taiwanese banks into Aleman's 
Panamanian accounts, and, if the Department wishes, post can 
send copies of the documents to Washington.
