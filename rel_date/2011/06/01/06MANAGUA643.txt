RESULTS AND WINS 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR PAUL TRIVELLI. REASONS 1.4 (B,D) 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) decided in 
favor of indigenous regional party Yatama on March 18, ruling 
that the party won 13 seats in Nicaragua's Northern 
Autonomous Region (RAAN) election instead of the previously 
reported 12.  Yatama leaders contested the election results 
in the 
RAAN based on a 2002 agreement signed by all political 
parties that transferred three JRVs from district 4 -- a 
predominantly Miskito area -- to district 14, predominantly 
Mestizo.  The CSE originally printed ballots reflecting this 
agreement.  However, after the Liberal Constitutional Party 
(PLC) contested them, the CSE reversed the decision and 
printed ballots returning them to the original polling 
station (JRV) divisions.  With this change, the Sandinistas 
(FSLN) took a seat at the expense of Yatama in the March 5 
election. 
 
¶2.  (U) Rejecting this outcome, Yatama leaders staged 
protests throughout Bilwi.  A group of Yatama protesters in 
 
the RAAN occupied the regional electoral council (CER) 
building in Bilwi on March 14 and held the CER president 
hostage.  Demonstrations also closed the airport, and Yatama 
members threatened to block the entrance to the city.  Yatama 
leader and Bilwi mayor Elizabeth Henriquez informed the press 
that Yatama would not form a government with either the FSLN 
or the PLC until the matter was resolved satisfactorily. 
 
¶3.  (C) An International Foundation for Elections (IFES) 
source related to poloff that the CSE had called a breakfast 
meeting on March 16 with IFES, Organization of American 
States (OAS) and the Center for Human Rights on the Atlantic 
Coast (CEDECA) to address the issue.  The CSE members 
outlined the situation and reported that they were able to 
work with the bishop in Bilwi to provide water to the captive 
CER representative.  According to the IFES representative, 
the CSE could not make any official pronouncements until 
midnight March 17 - the deadline for disputing election 
results.  However, the FSLN had apparently agreed not to 
fight Yatama's claim to the seat.  The CSE relayed 
information through the bishop that the situation would be 
resolved in Yatama's favor and announced it publicly on March 
20, in order to encourage Yatama to release the CER 
representative and refrain from more protests. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The CSE announced on March 18 that the seat had 
been given to Yatama, but the seat was won at the expense of 
the PLC, instead of the FSLN.  New regional totals are as 
follows: RAAN -- PLC 16, FSLN 16, Yatama 13, RAAS - PLC 22, 
FSLN 11, ALN-PC 6, Yatama 6.  The Yatama leadership called 
off the demonstrations the afternoon of March 18.  When 
businesses threatened to raise prices to recoup expenses from 
shipping products by land instead of by air when the airport 
was closed, Mayor Henriquez issued a statement threatening to 
fine any businesses that increased their prices due to the 
strike. 
 
¶5.  (C) Comment:  The calculations behind the CSE decision 
are complicated.  According to IFES, the Yatama seat would be 
taken from the FSLN, who had agreed not to fight Yatama's 
claim to the seat.  The original plan was to tally the votes 
with the three contested JRVs included in the voting center 
per the agreement in 2002.  This would have resulted in 
Yatama gaining the seat at the expense of the FSLN.  However, 
when the CSE decided to combine all the votes of the two 
affected voting centers and calculate the results based on 
the accumulated vote, Yatama won the additional seat at the 
expense of the PLC.  The PLC is contesting this decision and 
two other seats in the RAAN.  End Comment.
