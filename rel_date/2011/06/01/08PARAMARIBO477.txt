SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED:  NICARAGUAN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 122262 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) On December 2, Pol-Econ Chief delivered the 
demarche to Tom Kartoebi, Acting Head of the Americas 
Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government 
of the Republic of Suriname (GOS).  Kartoebi expressed 
disbelief that the Organization of American States (OAS) 
would have made comments on the Nicaraguan municipal 
elections, stating that noninterference in internal affairs 
is one of the OAS principles.  He especially doubted the 
statement in the demarche that "The European Union, the 
Organization of American States, international and domestic 
NGOs, and other members of Nicaraguan civil society have all 
noted these irregularities and called for a transparent 
recount." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kartoebi said he would consult with the Ministry's 
International Organizations Division to see whether the OAS 
itself had instructed member nations to urge the Nicaraguan 
government to conduct a transparent recount of all disputed 
municipal elections, and that credible observers be present. 
If the OAS had made such instruction directly to the GOS, the 
GOS would make a decison on whether it would take any 
actions, Kartoebi said. 
 
¶3. (SBU) After the meeting, Pol-Econ Chief sent to Kartoebi 
copies of the OAS and State Department press releases on the 
issue, which cited the concerns. 
 
¶4. (U) Post will report any subsequent reaction from the GOS 
in a separate cable.
