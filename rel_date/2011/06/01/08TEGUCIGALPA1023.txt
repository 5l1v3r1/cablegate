SUBJECT: GOH SIGNS ALBA DOCUMENT CONGRATULATING FSLN ON 
ELECTION VICTORY AND ACCUSING USG OF INTERFERENCE 
 
REF: TEGUCIGALPA 849 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Hugo Llorens, reasons 1.4 (b & d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  Presidential Legal Advisor Milton Jimenez 
announced on November 13 that the GOH had signed the 
Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas' (ALBA) document 
regarding the Nicaraguan elections.  In a telephone call 
initiated by the Ambassador, President Manuel "Mel" Zelaya 
explained his actions as simply an expression of solidarity 
with Ortega, who had described U.S. offenses that he 
considered "beyond normal diplomatic activity."  When the 
Ambassador described the systemic, widespread fraud that had 
been reported by international observers and NGOs, Zelaya 
feigned ignorance, and asked that the Ambassador provide the 
evidence for him to review, which we have done.  The 
Ambassador later received a call from Jimenez, who said 
Zelaya had asked him to look at the allegations that 
Nicaragua's elections had been fraudulent.  Jimenez did admit 
that he had held the press conference because Zelaya "told 
him to."  The Ambassador noted that there had been no Embassy 
intervention in the Nicaraguan elections and that most of the 
concerns about the massive electoral fraud had come from 
Nicaraguans themselves.  The Ambassador also conveyed our 
displeasure that the Honduran government had once again 
chosen to take sides on an issue involving the U.S. with the 
third country as was the case with during the credentialing 
ceremony.  He said such statements were not conducive to 
productive relations.  In a subsequent conversation with 
Jimenez, the Ambassador delivered reftel talking points on 
the Nicaraguan elections. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Jimenez held a press conference on November 13 at the 
Presidential Palace where he announced that the GOH had 
signed the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas' (ALBA) 
document regarding the Nicaraguan local elections, which 
specifically condemns U.S. Ambassador to Nicaragua Robert 
Callahan for "interference" and creating a "destabilizing" 
atmosphere in Nicaragua.  The document congratulates the FSLN 
and Daniel Ortega for their "historic victory," and condemns 
the violence perpetrated by the "right" in Nicaragua. 
 
¶3. (C) The Ambassador called President Manuel "Mel" Zelaya on 
November 14 to get an explanation for these moves, 
explaining that there was no USG involvement in the internal 
affairs of Nicaragua.  Zelaya explained that Ortega had 
called him to ask for his solidarity on this issue, and gave 
alleged examples of how the U.S. Embassy had gone beyond what 
Ortega considered "normal diplomatic practice."  For this 
reason, Zelaya said he decided to support Ortega and sign the 
ALBA statement.  Zelaya added that he had not received any 
requests for solidarity from the USG on this topic.  The 
Ambassador described the widespread, systemic fraud that have 
been reported from multiple Nicaraguan and international 
sources.  He asserted that this was not a USG issue, but an 
international one, adding Canada, the European Union and the 
United States had all made statements regarding the massive 
fraud.  Zelaya answered that he was unaware of this 
information and asked that the Ambassador forward it to him 
for review and consideration.  The Ambassador said he would 
be sending it to Zelaya and would follow-up with him 
subsequently to directly discuss this issue. 
 
¶4. (C) Following this conversation, under instructions from 
Zelaya, Presidential Advisor Milton Jimenez called the 
Ambassador to review the matter.  The Ambassador told Jimenez 
that this was the second time Honduras had taken sides 
against the Untied States in a dispute that did not concern 
it.  The Ambassador added that if the GOH were considering 
making such a statement, they should have first called us to 
consider our side of the issue.  Jimenez agreed that a call 
would have been prudent, but said that he was "instructed" to 
 
TEGUCIGALP 00001023  002 OF 002 
 
 
hold the press conference.  Subsequently, the Ambassador 
called Milton Jimenez again and delivered reftel talking 
points on the Nicaraguan elections and urged the Honduran 
government to work within the OAS and SICA to seriously 
address the freedom and fairness of the Nicaraguan elections. 
 Jimenez said he would immediately call President Zelaya who 
was in El Salvador and brief him on our conversation. 
 
¶5. (C) Comment: We believe that the public statements in 
support of the FSLN were orchestrated to keep support alive 
in the ALBA camp and continue to earn rebel laurels for 
Honduras.  It is the second time that Zelaya has joined his 
ALBA cohorts against the United States the last being the 
credentialing mini-crisis in September.  It is possible 
Zelaya is looking to see how far he can push the USG, 
especially with a contentious and chaotic primary election on 
the horizon.  We plan to work the Nicaraguan elections issue 
directly with Zelaya.  On the bilateral side, we will focus 
our energies on the primaries scheduled for November 30.  The 
holding of free and fair primaries will be a key step in 
supporting the democratic process in Honduras and ensuring a 
smooth transition beyond Zelaya.  End Comment.
