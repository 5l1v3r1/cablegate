SUBJECT: DANES SAY EU CONSENSUS DOES NOT SUPPORT NICARAGUAN 
ELECTION DONOR GROUP STATEMENT FOR NOW 
 
REF: SECSTATE 114848 
 
Classified By: Counselor for Political and Economic Affairs William 
Mozdzierz, Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (C) While Denmark shares U.S. concerns expressed in ref 
draft statement, it also will not break with the EU consensus 
that the release of a statement now is premature.  MFA Head 
of Section for Latin America Erik Hoeg told Pol/Econ 
Counselor and PolOff July 17 that Denmark saw "very little to 
dispute" in the substance of the proposed statement.  Denmark 
has two priority development countries in Latin America: 
Nicaragua and Bolivia, hence Denmark follows events with 
Nicaragua with "special interest," Hoeg said.  Hoeg added 
that Denmark was very aware of potential election 
difficulties (e.g., lack of a fully independent CSE), and 
because of this Denmark had also been a leader in pushing 
inside the EU for an EU Election Observation Mission for 
Nicaragua. 
 
¶2. (C) However, while Hoeg indicated Denmark was in agreement 
on the substance of the draft statement, it shares questions 
with other EU members on timing.  Hoeg said EU heads of 
mission in Managua had met on 24 May and 25 June and reached 
consensus that they did not favor issuing a statement now. 
Denmark will not break with that consensus, Hoeg confirmed. 
Discussion among the EU HOMs, according to Hoeg, centered on 
the issue of how many statements could usefully be issued in 
advance of the election and the point at which "too many 
statements reach diminishing returns."  In meantime, Hoeg 
said, EU missions are advocating for "quiet diplomacy." 
 
¶3. (C) Pol/Econ Counselor countered that, while quiet 
diplomacy has its role, it is important that the people of 
Nicaragua see early and often that the international donor 
community publicly backs their desire for a free and fair 
election.  Issuing this statement now lays down an important 
marker as we head into the fall election season that the 
international community is engaged and watching.  Hoeg 
indicated that Denmark and other EU members were not averse 
to issuing a statement farther into the election season. 
Pol/Econ Counselor cautioned that it would be better that our 
statements come earlier and be proactive, rather than reflect 
after-the-fact judgments on actions/events that might have 
been prevented.
