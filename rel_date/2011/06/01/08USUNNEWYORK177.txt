ICJ CASE, CANDIDATE FOR GA PRESIDENCY 
 
 
¶1.  BEGIN SUMMARY:  Nicaraguan PermRep Chamorro told Amb. 
Khalilzad on February 25 that Nicaragua welcomes the 
International Court of Justice's (ICJ) recent decision that 
it has jurisdiction to hear the maritime and territorial 
dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia.  Asserting that the 
ICJ had found that the 82nd parallel is not the maritime 
boundary between Colombia and Nicaragua, Chamorro said 
Nicaragua would be pleased if the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Agency (DEA) and Nicaragua could patrol that area together. 
Finally, Chamorro sought to reassure Amb. Khalilzad that 
Miguel D'Escoto, if elected to the General Assembly 
Presidency next year, would not use the position for partisan 
purposes.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  Nicaraguan PR Chamorro, accompanied by Nicaraguan Deputy 
PermRep Castillo, met with Amb. Khalilzad at their request 
February 25 to discuss the ICJ's December 13 decision in 
Nicaragua's maritime and boundary dispute with Colombia. 
Nicaragua seeks support from the P-5 and the 
Secretary-General in abiding by the ICJ's decision, she said, 
 
SIPDIS 
and to that end the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister discussed the 
case with the Secretary-General last week.  She described the 
ICJ's decision as favorable, finding that the ICJ has 
jurisdiction to hear the dispute, as Nicaragua had wanted. 
Chamorro also said the ICJ had decided that the 82nd line of 
longitude is not the border between Colombia and Nicaragua, 
as Colombia argues, and stressed Nicaragua's concerns about 
drug trafficking around the 82nd parallel.  Nicaraguan 
President Ortega has advised the Department that Nicaragua 
would be "more than willing" if DEA wanted to conduct joint 
patrols of the area around the 82nd parallel, she said, and 
Nicaragua plans to deliver a paper to the Department on the 
case this week. 
 
¶3.  Amb. Khalilzad cautioned that no unilateral decisions 
should be taken until the ICJ decides the case on the merits. 
 
¶4.  Chamorro also sought U.S. support for Miguel D'Escoto, 
Nicaragua's candidate for President of the General Assembly 
(PGA).  Amb. Khalilzad stressed that the United States views 
the PGA as an important position that should not be used for 
partisan purposes or otherwise to score political points, 
adding that the General Assembly can only be strengthened in 
an atmosphere of cooperation.  Chamorro responded that 
Nicaragua is aware of U.S. concerns and pledged that 
Nicaragua would not seek to use the office for partisan 
purposes, particularly to raise its bilateral objectives 
vis-a-vis Colombia. 
 
¶5.  Chamorro also welcomed the positive remarks about 
President Ortega's record on free trade and democracy that 
Under Secretary for Commerce and International Trade Padilla 
had made last week.
