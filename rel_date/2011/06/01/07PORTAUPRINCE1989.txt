¶1. (SBU) Summary: Venezuela and Cuba appear to be taking 
advantage of Haiti's electricity gap.  GOH sources up to and 
including President Preval say Haiti is accepting delivery of 
three Venezuela-supplied generators to supply Port-au-Prince, 
Cap Haitien and Gonaives.  The generators are to be installed 
with Cuban technical help.  After the December 16 visit to 
Haiti of Taiwanese Foreign Minister James Cheung, Haiti 
continues to accept assistance from a diverse set of donors. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy first heard of this project August 14 from 
Michael Lecorps, Director General for the GoH's Office of 
Monetization in the Ministry of Planning (the office 
responsible for managing PetroCaribe in Haiti).  He told 
Econoff that the Venezuelans had begun construction of three 
electricity plants in Haiti: Port-au-Prince (30 megawatts), 
Cap Haitien (15 megawatts) and Gonaives (15 megawatts).  The 
plant construction would be a product of a three-country 
cooperative effort including Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba.  At 
that time, he expected that the plants would be completed by 
January 2008. 
 
¶3. (C) President Rene Preval announced on December 18 at 
airport press conference before departing for Cuba that the 
Gonaives and Cap Haitien plants would open in February and 
the Port-au-Prince plant in May.  (Note: Preval said he would 
attend the 4th PetroCaribe summit and have a medical check-up 
in Cuba. End note.)  Ambassador heard from a close business 
associate of President Preval on December 14 that Venezuelan 
President Chavez is pressing President Preval to visit Haiti 
to inaugurate the Cap Haitien plant in a splashy public 
ceremony.  Rene Jean Jumeau (protect), Energy Consultant in 
the Ministry of Public Works, noted that the GoH would have 
to work on the state-owned electricity company EDH's 
(Electricte d'Haiti) distribution infrastructure to bring 
electricity to the large numbers of consumers who currently 
do not have access to EDH's network.  Jumeau also said the 
plants would run on fossil fuels purchased through the 
PetroCaribe agreement. 
 
¶4. (C) Jumeau said the Government of Cuba is providing the 
technical assistance for construction of the plants, and 
training Haitians in Cuba to operate them.  As for 
management, Jumeau said that the "options are still being 
considered," but the plants will have a mixed management team 
with representatives of all three countries. 
 
¶5. (SBU) President Preval told visiting Congresswoman Corrine 
Brown December 10 that Haiti was taking delivery of the three 
generators for these power plants the second week of 
December.  Installation of the units would follow soon, he 
said. 
 
¶6. (C) Comment: Venezuela, aided by Cuba, is taking advantage 
of a yawning electricity gap in Haiti: the capital is without 
power at least 50 percent of the time (longer during the dry 
winter months) and much of the rest of the country suffers 
even longer blackouts.  Haiti will accept this kind of 
assistance from any source.  We do not believe the Preval 
administration is ideologically motivated in accepting aid 
from Venezuela or Cuba.  Indeed, many Haitians rationalize 
that foreigners owe their country assistance in exchange for 
Haiti's unique historical contributions to freedom in the 
hemisphere.  Lecorps on August 14 told Econoff that the BRV 
was providing this development assistance to Haiti as 
compensation for the help provided to Simon Bolivar in the 
early 19th century.  Haiti is omnivorous in soliciting and 
accepting assistance.  The day after telling Congresswoman 
Brown about accepting Venezuelan-financed generators, 
President Preval received visiting Taiwanese Foreign Minister 
James Huang.  Press reports say the main subject was 
Taiwanese assistance, including assistance for agriculture.
