¶5.  (C) ALN candidate Montealegre, who recently told the 
Ambassador he expected 
the assignments of the deputy seats to remain the same even 
with the ALN's challenges, was nonetheless determined to 
convey his party's concerns regarding the irregularities in 
the tabulation process even if these irregularities did not 
affect the final distribution of Assembly deputy seats.  And 
while the PLC sought to challenge a deputy seat in the North

Atlantic Autonomous Zone (RAAN), in the end the party failed 
(according to the CSE) to follow proper legal steps at the 
departmental level before submitting its appeal, and its 
petition was rejected.
