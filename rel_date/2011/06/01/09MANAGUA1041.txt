¶1.  (C) Summary: After the Supreme Court's (CSJ) ruling 
allowing Presdient Daniel Ortega's re-election, civil society 
across the board has stated clearly its opposition to the 
decision.  They have labeled the decision as illegal and a 
major step backward for Nicaragua's democracy.  While NGOs 
continue to put out statements and communiques denouncing the 
ruling, youth have taken to the street in small acts of 
protest.  Meanwhile, Ortega and his FSLN stalwarts publicly 
defend the decision and "the people's right to chose their 
leaders."  The FSLN has also moved preemptively in occupying 
public spaces to intimidate and prevent any large public 
opposition to Ortega and the court's ruling.  End Summary.

NGOs Call for Public to Resist, Youth Act 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In the days following the October 19 CSJ ruling 
(reftel), NGOs and other non-political actors have denounced 
the court's decision in allowing Ortega's re-election.  The 
day following the ruling Movimiento por Nicaragua, the 
Autonomous Women's Movement, and other NGOs issued a joint 
statement describing the ruling as an illegitimate mechanism 
to allow Ortega's re-election and rejecting "the birth of a 
dictatorship in Nicaragua."  They also called on Nicaraguans 
to peacefully resist the dictatorship and as of now not to 
recognize any national election that includes Ortega as a 
candidate.  Another NGO, Hagamos Democracia, characterized 
the ruling as "aberrant and opportunistic, which violates the 
Constitution."  It then warns that the CSJ's decision marks 
"regression in the democratic process that could lead to 
violence."  Similar statements were repeated from a variety 
of NGOs and more are expected. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Other non-political actors have expressed 
themselves in similar terms.  Bishop Juan Abelardo Mata, Vice 
President of Nicaragua's Conference of Bishops, stated that 
while he was not an attorney, "the sad truth was that those 
who govern use the Constitution as toilet paper."  The two 
principal private sector entities also denounced the court's 
decision.  In its statement, the American Chamber of Commerce 
in Nicaragua (AmCham) denounced the court for acting "against 
all judicial logic" and rejected the "illegal and 
illegitimate" ruling of the magistrates who "violated 
(Nicaragua's) constitutional order."  It said actions like 
these do nothing but scare off foreign investment and inhibit 
the possibilities of development.  The Higher Council of the 
Private Sector (COSEP) rejected that the court, "through a 
ruling, reformed the constitution , which is solely the 
jurisdiction of the National Assembly or a constituent 
assembly ... this decision, is therefore, a violation of the 
constitution and the rule of law." 
 
¶4.  (C) While organized groups of civil society publicly 
denounced the CSJ's ruling and called for Nicaraguans to 
unite and resist Ortega's dictatorial tendencies, several 
youth groups have begun to act out against the governing FSLN 
and the state institutions that the party controls.  One 
group carried a toilet in front of the Supreme Electoral 
Council (CSE) and simulated a CSE magistrate defecating on 
Nicaragua; the group held posters that read "Magistrates: 
treason has a high price."  Another group awaited the arrival 
of CSJ magistrate Francisco Rosales in front of a television 
station; upon Rosales' arrival the university group hurled 
eggs at the magistrate.  Yet another group sprayed graffiti 
in Managua calling for Nicaraguans to stand-up to Ortega and 
holding posters that read, "after Mel goes Ortega" (in 
reference to the situation in Honduras).

FSLN Defends Decision - "Ortega in 2011" 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) While civil society groups denounce the court's 
decision as illegal and youth groups begin to take small 
steps to demonstrate their frustration, Ortega and his 
 
MANAGUA 00001041  002 OF 002 
 
 
governing FSLN are aggressively defending the court's 
decision and have preemptively occupied key public spaces to 
forestall opposition demonstrations.  In an October 20 public 
speech, Ortega belittled the opposition to the court's 
decision and stated that the ruling "cannot be appealed ... 
it is written in stone."  Other FSLN leadership have been 
making the rounds carrying the same message.  CSJ Vice 
President Rafael Solis (a close confident of Ortega and one 
of six judges who voted for the re-election), told media 
"this issue is closed.  They (the opposition) have to accept 
that Daniel Ortega will be a candidate in 2011."  In another 
statement, Solis apparently recognized that his party does 
not represent (nor govern) for all Nicaraguans by stating 
"38% of the population is happy and the rest of the people 
are saying terrible things of us" (in allusion to the 38% of 
the population who voted for Ortega in the 2006 presidential 
election). 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Another trusted Ortega ally also has backed 
publicly the court's decision and called people to the 
streets.  As he has in the past, National Assembly Deputy 
Gustavo Porras (FSLN) called the governing party's supporters 
to occupy Managua's rotundas to "support the court's 
decision" because the streets "belong to us."  As a result, 
on October 20 FSLN supporters moved preemptively to occupy 
public space and prevent the opposition from mounting in 
public protests or marches.  (Note: In the past, the FSLN has 
reacted violently to public demonstrations in opposition to 
the government.)  Other government officials also have stated 
that they will take to the streets.  Minister of Education 
Miguel de Castilla told media that he and public school 
teachers would go to the streets to publicly support the 
court's ruling and Ortega's re-election. 
 
¶7.  (C) Finally, it appears that Ortega also coordinated some 
international support for the court's ruling to further 
"legitimize" the decision.  Immediately following the court's 
ruling on October 19, the Venezuelan-led Bolivarian Alliance 
for the People of our America (ALBA) issued a communique 
acknowledging the CSJ action, ratifying ALBA's support for 
the democratic institutions of Nicaragua, and applauding the 
Nicaraguan people for the continual consolidation of its 
democratic system.

¶8.  (C) As expected, civil society as a whole has rejected 
the court's ruling on Ortega's re-election, calling the 
decision illegal, a blow to Nicaragua's constitutional order, 
and a step backward for Nicaraguan democracy.  While NGOs and 
other organized groups take time to think through what 
actions they will take, small groups of youth have begun to 
demonstrate their frustration with the FSLN and the state 
institutions they control.  How these civil society groups 
will combine with the political opposition to the court's 
ruling and Ortega remains to be seen.  (Note: Political 
parties' opposition to the court's ruling will be reported 
septel.)  However, the fact that Ortega and his FSLN 
immediately defended the decision and have taken to the 
streets increases the risk that events in Nicaragua could 
turn violent.
