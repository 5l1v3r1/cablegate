Classified By: Ambassador Robert J. Callahan for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  On November 3, 2008, Nicaragua's largest 
circulation daily, "La Prensa," ran a page two article 
reporting on a document purporting to be instructions for 
Citizen Power Councils (CPC) militants regarding plans of 
Ortega's Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party 
for the upcoming municipal elections on November 9.  We were 
given a copy of this document on October 30 from a source 
within the Government of Nicaragua and who told us that this 
document was distributed during a recent CPC meeting in 
Managua.  We have confirmed that the Jamileth Gradiz 
mentioned, and identified as a CPC leader, is employed in the 
Civil Registry Office of Managua City.  (NOTE: Between 
October 30 and November 3 Embassy offices were given 
identical information, including copies of similar documents, 
from four separate sources. END NOTE.)  This document 
includes very explicit operational plans and tactics designed 
to improve the FLSN's chances of victory, including 
surreptitious voiding of opposition ballots and instructions 
on how to vote more than once.  We are unable to definitely 
confirm this document's authenticity, but if it is real, it 
is a remarkably candid demonstration of the FSLN's commitment 
to victory at all costs.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U)  BEGIN TRANSLATION OF DOCUMENT. 
 
This Seminar, financed by the campaign committee of the FSLN 
was coordinated and partially presented by the route chief of 
District IV, Lic. Jamileth Gradiz, who is also the director 
of the Civil Registry Office (in Managua).  The following 
topics were discussed on how to act in order to win the 
elections, at any cost. 
 
¶1.  The electoral police (three for each center), one 
outside, one at the door and the last one inside the 
precinct, are on our side (FSLN) and were chosen by 
Gobernacion (Interior Ministry) to do the following:  if one 
of our supporters comes into the precinct smelling of 
alcohol, wearing a campaign shirt or hat with propaganda, 
they will let them in, and if there are arguments, fights or 
unruly behaviors, the police will intercede in our favor. 
 
¶2.  The voting precincts will open at 6:00 sharp in the 
morning, and will be closed at 5:00 in the afternoon, no 
matter what.  This means that all our people would have 
already voted by 2:00 pm, and at closing time the ones that 
will be left without having voted will be the ones from the 
right, who are the lazy ones. 
 
¶3.  Inside the precinct, we have to do whatever it takes to 
nullify the Liberal votes.  For example: don't put the secret 
code on the ballot, or strike a line through it or don't sign 
the ballot, etc.  For this we count on the poll watchers as 
well as the ones from ALN, PRN and AC, who are our allies who 
have infiltrated into their parties.  They will start small 
talk to distract the Liberal poll watchers so we can carry 
out the plan.  We have be to firm in this.

¶4.  There will be national and international observers.  They 
will have CSE identification. One of our supporters will be 
among them, and will give us a signal (which will be provided 
later).  To these infiltrators we will provide all the 
courtesies (they are our friends, you know), otherwise do not 
let them in.  Tell them we are either busy, eating, helping 
voters or make up anything.  Remember those people come only 
to pass the time. 
 
¶5.  The ones that can vote in another precinct do so.  They 
have the right, but try not to have your finger stained so 
you can vote again in your precinct.  If they stain your 
finger, ask them to do it "light" and hide it, so when they 
are not looking or when the Liberal poll watcher goes to eat, 
the other poll watchers can do it.  Don't worry, they are 
allied and just remember that your cedula is not going to be 
marked. 
 
¶6.  When it's time to count the ballots, if we are losing, we 
have to wise up.  When the recounting is being performed and 
they are off guard, scratch the ballots, tear them or spill 
ink on them. 
 
¶7.  There will be at least ten comrades from the CPC outside 
each precinct, ready to intervene at any given moment.
