COOPERATION 
 
REF: HAVANA 15750 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) FSLN Presidential candidate Daniel Ortega traveled to 
Cuba last week to express his "concern and solidarity" for 
Fidel Castro and "reaffirm cooperative efforts" with the 
Government of Cuba.  Though it appears that Ortega did not 
actually meet with Castro (reftel), he used the opportunity 
to promote programs to benefit Nicaraguans and to campaign -- 
making frequent announcements from Cuba on 'Radio Ya,' a 
Sandinista-owned station managed by Ortega's son. 
 
¶2.  (C) Ortega has made plain in his public announcements 
that if he wins in November, he plans to reestablish the 
cooperative relationship and collective programs that 
Nicaragua enjoyed with the Cuban government in the 1980,s. 
Specifically discussed with Cuban officials were medical 
treatment, medical training, and scholarships for 
Nicaraguans.  Ortega has also told the international press 
that Castro is active and making government decisions. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) FSLN founder and National Assembly Deputy Tomas 
Borge echoed Ortega's sentiments in an open letter to Fidel 
that was published in local newspapers over the weekend.  He 
mentions several supporters of Castro and their continuing 
concern for his health.  Borge writes that he will not 
celebrate his own birthday -- coincidentally the same as 
Castro's -- but instead attend the masses organized by 
thousands of Nicaraguans to pray for Castro's recovery. 
Borges' paean ends with the statement that Castro is beloved 
by millions and that his ideas will endure for centuries. 
 
¶4.  (C) COMMENT:  While the other political parties have 
largely been quiet about Castro's illness, Ortega is 
attempting to use the situation to his advantage to proclaim 
his solidarity with Castro, emphasize his revolutionary 
heritage, and criticize the United States for 
interventionism.  END COMMENT
