REF: MANAGUA 220 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The OAS election observation team and efforts to 
combat election fraud may fail unless certain steps are 
taken, according to Nicaraguan Ambassador to the OAS Jose 
Luis Velasquez.  Velasquez, and senior MFA advisor Ariel 
Granera, during a 26 January meeting with the Ambassador, DCM 
and Poloff, voiced their concerns about the OAS election 
observation team, election fraud, and Venezuelan funding for 
the FSLN.  Both individuals stressed the importance of a 
clear message on election observations from the OAS and the 
Embassy. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Velasquez opined that a loophole in the way the OAS 
election observation team was invited to Nicaragua could be 
used to invalidate the team's observations.  He believes that 
the OAS team must clarify this issue. (Note: For the last few 
months, three PLC magistrates on the seven member board of 
the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) have abstained.  There 
must be five votes in order to have a quorum, which means 
that the legality of any recent CSE decisions, including the 
invitation to the OAS observers, could be questioned.  OAS 
envoy John Biehl (Reftel) confirmed to CSE magistrates on 
January 26 that the CSE invitation was not legitimate for 
this reason and also because it must be transmitted to the 
OAS via the MFA.) Velasquez observed that it is "too late for 
the Atlantic Coast elections," and that the 25 planned OAS 
election observers will only be able to gather information on 
problems that must be addressed before the national 
elections. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Granera also expressed concerns about the OAS 
election team, asserting that the team must establish a 
minimum threshold of accomplishments to ensure free and fair 
elections.  He believes that if the team decides a thorough 
scrub of the voter registry (padron) is necessary to ensure a 
fair election, it will be impossible to accomplish this 
before November and there will be a move to postpone 
elections.  Velasquez mentioned that if the team recommends 
replacing the entire CSE, this too might derail the 
elections; both agreed that these actions must be taken after 
the election.  They urged the United States and the OAS team 
to clearly state their objectives and to be completely frank 
with the CSE about the requirements for OAS participation and 
what must be accomplished.  The Ambassador and DCM outlined 
the three-part plan for election observation, diagnosis of 
the problems, and technical assistance from IFES, and urged 
Velasquez and Granera to help correct misperceptions that 
IFES is a U.S. government agency. 
 
¶4. (C) Velasquez then voiced his concerns about the February 
1 release of an OAS report on the recent Venezuelan 
(regional) elections.  He fears that the report will validate 
Chavez's election and pushed for a combined message from the 
United States and Nicaragua that forcefully rejects a process 
that legitimizes a fraudulent government.  He believes that 
few countries in the region will speak out against the 
report.  Granera claims that ties between Venezuela and Cuba 
are stronger than ever and that "Chavez and Fidel will not 
let Ortega lose."  He believes that Chavez is actively 
funding the FSLN.  When the Ambassador asked if he had any 
proof or names of people who received money from Chavez, 
Velasquez claimed that Chavez is too smart to do anything 
overt, but that almost everyone from the FSLN who travels to 
Caracas brings back money in their suitcases to finance 
Ortega's election campaign.
