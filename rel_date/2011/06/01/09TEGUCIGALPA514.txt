Classified By: Ambassador Hugo Llorens, reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
---------------------------------- 
One Protest Spot, Business Resuming 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) Minister of Security Jorge Rodas reported to 
Ambassador on June 28 at 16:00 local (18:00 EDT) that there 
had been virtually no incidents of violence or unrest in the 
country Sunday, save for those isolated small cases already 
mentioned in Sitrep #2.  The ruling regime called a 
21:00-06:00 curfew late Sunday evening, effective for 48 
hours, until 06:00 local June 30. 
 
¶2. (U) As of noon local today (June 29), the only point of 
significant protest or street action remains the area 
directly outside the Presidential Palace; crowds have reached 
3000 at that location, and have blocked street access to the 
Palace.  Approximately 1000 military personnel and 200 
anti-riot police with a water-cannon-equipped vehicle have 
been posted within the Palace grounds as a precautionary 
measure.  Roberto Micheletti, whom Congress proclaimed as 
President yesterday, arrived at the Palace at 10:00 local 
(noon EDT), which apparently led to the increased street 
activity and security posture.  Micheletti issued a statement 
that the protesters were free to express their opinions, but 
warned any obscenities or threats ("groserias") would not be 
tolerated.  While the protesters have blocked street access 
to the Marriott Hotel next door to the Palace, individuals 
are being allowed access to the hotel.  The shopping mall two 
blocks away is open again and customers have been seen coming 
and going from all entrances.  All indications so far are 
that in most parts of the country, people have resumed their 
work week. 
 
---------------------- 
Political Developments 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Virtually all Embassy contacts continue to assert that 
all the actions against President Zelaya were done legally, 
including Supreme Court President Rivera Aviles and members 
of Congress from both the opposition and the President,s own 
Liberal Party.  (Note: acting President Micheletti is himself 
a member of the Liberal Party.  End note.).  Human Rights 
Commissioner Dr. Ramon Custodio spoke at length on the radio 
this morning in favor of the actions taken so far.  The newly 
appointed Foreign Minister, Enrique Ortez Colindres, did the 
same on television. 
 
¶4. (C) The Honduran political elite and the bulk of the 
general population have displayed a high degree of naivete 
over how the coup would be perceived by the international 
community.  Virtually all political elites and personal 
contacts have expressed surprise and dismay at the USG 
response, stating that they feel abandoned by the USG. 
Contacts are baffled by our expressions of concern about 
President Zelaya,s actions in the days before the coup 
followed by our strong response condemning the coup 
afterward.  They are currently showing no signs of backing 
down from the removal of Zelaya, and continue firm in their 
belief that they acted in defense of their constitution.  The 
currently acting authorities and their supporters appear to 
be getting prepared to ride out the storm of international 
condemnation and opposition to the coup until scheduled 
elections are held November 29. 
 
¶5. (C) In a meeting with three senior Honduran business 
leaders June 28, the Ambassador condemned the coup against 
the Zelaya government.  The three, Antonio Travel, Emilio 
Larache and Emin Barjum, accepted that the coup was illegal 
but argued that there was no choice but to accept the current 
regime and wait until November elections for the restoration 
 
TEGUCIGALP 00000514  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
of constitutional government.  The Ambassador rejected this 
idea and argued that the only solution was for Zelaya to be 
restored to power. 
 
¶6. (C) In a meeting with former President Ricardo Maduro and 
Tegucigalpa Mayor Ricardo Alvarez, both National Party 
members, on June 29 the Ambassador again condemned the coup. 
Maduro and Alvarez expressed amazement that the coup took 
place at all and their strong disagreement with it.  They 
agreed that the move had seriously damaged Honduran democracy 
and isolated the country from the world community.  They 
argued that the problem now was that most of the population 
supported the coup.  Most of their political allies looked at 
the issue as a question between "patriotism or Mel" and were 
unwilling to accept that the coup was illegal.  They 
suggested that the Micheletti regime would use this support 
to withstand international pressure and play out the clock 
until the November elections, and restoration of 
constitutional government in January of next year. The 
Ambassador made clear that there would be great international 
pressure put on the illegitimate Honduran authorities. 
 
¶7. (C) The Executive Director of the Cortes Chamber of 
Commerce phoned EconCouns from a videoconference in which he 
was participating, where he said the Honduran Private 
Enterprise Council (COHEP) was planning demonstrations in 
support of the coup.  The Executive Director agreed with the 
USG position that Sunday's action was inappropriate and 
thought the business community was acting irrationally. 
 
¶8. (U) The acting government has announced the following 
cabinet assignments: 
     - Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez Colindres 
     - Finance Minister Gabriela Nunez 
     - Defense Minister Adolfo Leonel Sevilla 
     - State telecom company (HONDUTEL) director Jorge Aguilar 
     - current Security Minister Jorge Rodas Gamero has been 
asked to remain. 
 
¶9. (C) The Embassy is maintaining a no-contact policy with 
the Micheletti regime.  (Note: We will seek Department 
guidance on restricting our development, and security 
activities in the country.)  We will remain in contact with 
members of the Congress, who have not taken positions in the 
regime, but will keep a low profile in all contacts. 
 
¶10. (S) DATT sources have reported rumors that President 
Zelaya may attempt to re-enter Honduras overland from 
Nicaragua and approach the Presidential Palace.  There are 
also internet rumors that the Nicaraguan military is 
mobilizing. 
 
11 (C) DATT has been contacted by former Executive VP 
Mejia,s wife noting that she does not feel secure at her 
current  location, as it is surrounded by troops.  While she 
has not made any decision to leave the country yet, she would 
seek her usual Embassy assistance if she does.  (Note: 
Mejia,s five-year-old son,s name is close to that of a 
person on no-fly watch lists, so she receives Embassy 
assistance any time she plans to travel outside the country. 
End note.) 
 
12 (C) The Ambassador has been in close contact with 
President Zelaya,s family and offered our support.  He has 
spoken by phone with the First Lady, who is in the 
countryside in Olancho as well as with the president,s older 
son, who is in Tegucigalpa.  The president,s younger son and 
family moved to the ambassador,s residence Sunday night.  We 
have passed on President Funes, offer to send a plane to 
bring them to El Salvador, and offered to transport them to a 
plane.  As of now, there preference is to remain in Honduras 
out of fear of having their property confiscated.  Leftist 
radio and television host Eduardo Maldonado, who feared 
arrest, is staying at the DCM,s residence.

--------------------------------- 
Infrastructure and Communications 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶13. (U) Toncontin airport remains open for international 
flights, and American, Continental and Delta airlines 
continue to operate flights as usual.  Flights are arriving 
and departing with minimal delays, and the airport road is 
open and clear. 
 
¶14. (U) Landline telephones have been restored, as have 
electricity, Internet access and many television stations. 
Those local stations associated closely with Zelaya and his 
&Citizen Power8 movement are still off the air, although 
Channel 11, run by the Rosenthal Family, which long backed 
Zelaya, is back on. 
 
------------------------------- 
Consular and Embassy Operations 
------------------------------- 
 
¶15. (U) The Embassy is open only for emergency services to 
Amcits only June 29, and Post will determine operational 
status for June 30 at a scheduled 15:00 local (17:00 EDT) EAC 
meeting.  Because the USG does not recognize the Micheletti 
regime, the Embassy will not send diplomatic notes until 
further notice.  Due to the Marriott hotel,s proximity to 
the Presidential Palace and its difficulties providing 
customer services, the Embassy will move all 
temporarily-housed personnel out of the Marriott.  The 
Embassy has canceled the official National Day event 
scheduled for July 2 at the Ambassador,s Residence, but will 
hold an informal event limited to employees and family later 
that day instead if security conditions remain the same.  At 
present, the planned celebration for Mission personnel and 
the broader Amcit community for July 4 at the Panamerican 
Agricultural University in Zamorano is still on. 
 
¶16. (U) The Consular Section has received welfare and 
whereabouts calls on 200 Amcits to date via telephone and 
email.  Post is preparing a new warden message to be issued 
as soon as it is cleared.  Consular Section continues to 
regularly update ACS talking points on the Embassy website.
