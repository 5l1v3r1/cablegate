SUBJECT: FSLN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CHIEF CLAIMS ORTEGA SEEKS 
POSITIVE RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: Sandinista (FSLN) foreign affairs advisor 
Samuel Santos insists that Daniel Ortega seeks positive, 
constructive relations with the U.S. government.  Santos 
decried to polcouns, poloff, and visiting INR analyst on 
March 13 the USG's "loss of interest" in its American 
neighbors, while lauding Secretary Rice for meeting with Evo 
Morales.  A successful entrepreneur, Santos asserts that the 
FSLN supports CAFTA in principal, but insists laws are needed 
to help Nicaraguans better compete with the United States. 
He attempted to smooth over Ortega's blaming the U.S. for the 
world drug problem, asserting that all nations must partner 
to combat the drug scourge.   Santos asserted that an Ortega 
government would engage the Iraqi government and support an 
international effort to help Iraq.  He believes that an 
international body should monitor Iran's and any other 
nation's use of nuclear energy.  Santos, who claims to have 
Ortega's ear, is distressed that U.S. influence in Nicaragua 
could work against his boss Ortega in November.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) In his March 13 meeting with polcouns, poloff, and 
visiting INR analyst, FSLN foreign affairs advisor Samuel 
Santos insisted that Daniel Ortega seeks positive, 
constructive relations with the U.S. government.  He claimed 
Ortega has toned down his anti-U.S. rhetoric, as evidenced by 
Ortega's removal two years ago of anti-Yankee lyrics in the 
Sandinista anthem.  Santos decried what he termed "the USG's 
loss of interest" in its American neighbors.  While the 
European nations have helped one another to develop, and Asia 
is taking a similar approach, the Americas and Africa are 
trailing far behind in economic and social development, 
bemoaned Santos.  As the strongest political and economic 
power in the region, the United States must show maturity and 
leadership, argued Santos, who added that Secretary Rice's 
recent meeting with new Bolivian President Evo Morales is a 
magnificent step in the right direction.  Similarly, waxed 
Santos, the USG should consider rapprochement with Venezuelan 
leader Hugo Chavez. 
 
CAFTA OK in Principal

¶3.  (C) On the subject of CAFTA, Santos, a successful 
entrepreneur in Nicaragua's tourism sector, asserted that the 
FSLN supports CAFTA in principal, but the National Assembly 
should pass legislation to position Nicaraguans to better 
compete with the United States.  The fact that the 
Sandinistas helped form the required Assembly quorum on March 
9 until enough of their Liberal colleagues arrived, is 
evidence of the Sandinistas willingness to allow CAFTA to 
proceed, explained Santos. 
 
Open on Iraq Policy, Uninformed over Iran

¶4.  (C) Noting that most Iraqis -- who in just over one year 
have voted in two elections and a constitutional assembly -- 
are content that Saddam's oppressive era is over, polcouns 
queried Santos over what position the FSLN would take towards 
Iraq if Ortega won the November elections.  He replied that 
the FSLN would be open to engaging the Iraqi government and 
would support a coordinated international effort to help Iraq 
resolve its internal crisis.  While Santos pled ignorance on 
Iran, he asserted that an international body should monitor 
Iran's and any other nation's use of nuclear energy.  We 
clarified that such an organization exists, the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the Iranian government has 
refused to cooperate with it. 
 
Wriggling out of the Blame Game

¶5.  (C) To polcouns' query over Ortega's frequent blaming of 
the United States for the world drug problem, Santos squirmed 
and attempted to smooth over Ortega's accusations, asserting 
that all nations must partner to combat the drug scourge.  He 
acknowledged that domestic drug consumption is on the rise, 
sharing his worries that his teenage daughter is exposed to 
drugs when she goes clubbing with friends.  Further, in 
general terms, the FSLN condemns terrorist acts against 
innocent civilians, elaborated Santos.  He alleged that the 
 
Sandinistas have never harbored terrorists -- with the 
exception of the Basques because an "ally nation" asked 
Ortega to allow a number of ETA militants to settle in 
Nicaragua.  Most have married local women and left their 
extremism behind, asserted Santos. 
 
The Uncle Sam Fear Factor

¶6.  (C) At the close of the meeting, Santos voiced concern 
that senior USG officials will, once again, strike hard 
against Ortega as the November presidential and Assembly 
elections near.  He sought our assurances that the U.S. will 
refrain from "unhelpful attacks" on Ortega and from meddling 
in Nicaragua's political deliberations.  Polcouns clarified 
that the USG's primary interest is that Nicaragua hold free, 
fair, credible, and inclusive national elections in November, 
that all Nicaraguans who wish to vote may do so, and that 
they will know for whom and for what they are voting.  While 
the U.S. does not "have a candidate" in Nicaragua's 
presidential race, we will support democratic principals and 
recognize those who truly represent them.  She reiterated 
that the USG maintains its reservations over Ortega, given 
his track record and his continuing anti-U.S. rhetoric. 
Similarly, the USG has robustly criticized Liberal 
Constitutional Party (PLC) caudillo/convicted money launderer 
Arnoldo Aleman, who has pacted with Ortega to maintain 
political hegemony and in doing so, corrupted Nicaragua's 
judiciary and other government powers. 
 
Comment

¶7.  (C) Information from reliable sources suggests that, 
contrary to Santos' rosy assertions, the Sandinistas maintain 
close ties with narco-dealers in the Atlantic Coast region 
and that a number of Sandinista candidates received 
narco-funds and logistical support for their campaigns. 
Santos, who claims to have Ortega's ear and explicit 
instructions to engage us, was visibly distressed that U.S. 
influence in Nicaragua could work against his boss Ortega in 
November.
