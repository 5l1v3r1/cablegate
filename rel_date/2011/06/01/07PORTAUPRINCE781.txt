CHECK? 
 
REF: A. PAP 522 
     ¶B. PAP 773 
 
Classified By: Classified by Ambassador Janet A. Sanderson for reasons 
1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Secretary General of the Presidency Fritz Longchamps 
on April 26 reported to Polcouns that President Preval will 
attend the Alba summit in Venzuela as a "special observer" 
for the express purpose of finalizing a tri-lateral 
assistance agreement between Haiti, Venezuela, and Cuba, 
whereby Venezuela will finance the presence of Cuban doctors 
and other technicians in rural Haiti.  Longchamps expressed 
surprise that the USG would take issue with Preval's 
attendance at this meeting.  He reiterated that Venezuelan 
assistance, particularly in providing health care to the most 
deprived parts of Haiti, was too important for President 
Preval not to pursue.  Preval had never participated in or 
associated himself with Chavez' attacks against the U.S. and 
would not on this trip.  Nor did he have any intention of 
joining Alba.  Longchamps reminded Polcouns of their 
discussions immediately after Chavez visited Haiti (ref 
B)--how President Preval had curtailed Chavez' activities 
during the visit and how uncomfortable Chavez' behavior had 
made everyone during his stay. 
 
¶2. (C)  Polcouns replied that though that may have been the 
case, for the USG, the net result was that President Preval 
gave Chavez another platform from which to attack the United 
States and then saw him off from the airport.  The USG 
understood that Preval felt obliged to pursue all sources of 
assistance for Haiti, but did not understand why he continued 
to participate in fora where Chavez vilified Haiti's most 
important and reliable bi-lateral partner. USG officials 
would ask President Preval this question during his upcoming 
trip to Washington in May. 
 
¶3. (C)  Comment.  Longchamps seemed genuinely surprised that 
Polcouns asked for an appointment specifically to raise our 
displeasure with Preval's Venezuela trip.   To some degree, 
Longchamp's reaction probably reflects Preval's own 
obliviousness to the impact and consequences his 
accommodation of Chavez has on relations with us. 
Longchamps, sophisticated and experienced as he is, also 
betrayed a common trait among Haitian officials in misjudging 
the relative importance that U.S. policy makers attach to 
Haiti versus Venezuela and Chavez' regional impact.  As 
reported in ref A, messages delivered to Preval in Haiti, 
whether through intermediaries or directly, are likely to 
have little impact. We should convey our discontent with 
Preval's actions at the highest possible level when he next 
visits Washington.
