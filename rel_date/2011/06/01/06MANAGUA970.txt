SUBJECT: BUSINESS MAGNATE CARLOS PELLAS CLAIMS MONTEALEGRE 
UNLIKELY TO WIN FOUR-WAY RACE 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR PAUL TRIVELLI. REASONS 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Business magnate Carlos Pellas claims that statistics 
from past elections "prove" that Eduardo Montealegre is 
unlikely to win a four-way race in November and argues that 
Montealegre must thus come to terms with Arnoldo Aleman and 
his Liberal Constitutional Party (PLC).  Both Pellas and 
President Bolanos are working to negotiate an alliance 
between the PLC and Montealegre's ALN-PC; all of the specific 
that we have seen thus far would require Aleman to step aside 
from politics, a highly questionable prospect.  Pellas 
presented the Embassy with an analysis of various scenarios 
that could arise in a four-way presidential race, arguing 
that all these scenarios result in continued PLC-FSLN control 
of the National Assembly and that there is a real risk of a 
Daniel Ortega victory in the first round.  However, Pellas' 
analysis does not take into account the historical tendency 
of Nicaraguan voters to rally around whatever candidate seems 
most able to defeat Ortega, nor does he consider that the 
best way to prevent an Ortega victory would to marginalize 
Aleman immediately in order to make possible a broad Liberal 
alliance and avoid a four way race in the first place.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C) At an April 28 breakfast at the Ambassador's 
residence with President Bolanos and business magnate Carlos 
Pellas, Pellas presented a political analysis of past voter 
behavior that he claimed "proves" that an Eduardo Montealegre 
victory in a four way race is very unlikely.  Pellas also 
suggested that under any scenario, "pacto" forces will retain 
control of the National Assembly.  Pellas reported that the 
FSLN is counting on four pillars for its victory: Cardinal 
Miguel Obando y Bravo, Hugo Chavez, a divided right, and a 
vice presidential candidacy by liberal maverick/loose cannon 
Jaime Morales (to calm the private sector). 
 
¶3.  (C) Regarding current efforts to unite the center-right, 
Pellas reported that discussions are focused on Montealegre's 
taking the PLC vice presidential slot in exchange for 15-20 
deputies, with each side enjoying a limited number of slots 
they can veto from the other's list, to ensure that the most 
odious PLC Assembly candidates do not run.  PLC admitted that 
this deal will only work if Aleman agrees to step aside from 
politics.  Pellas stressed that "big capital" has made it 
clear in private that neither the PLC nor the ALN-PC will 
receive funds unless a deal is struck. 
 
¶4.  (C) President Bolanos told the Ambassador that he will 
travel to El Salvador the first week in May to talk to 
President Saca and ex-President Calderon Sol regarding the 
Nicaraguan political mix.  Bolanos believes that the best 
strategy is to publicly merge Montealegre's ALN-PC, the 
Alliance for the Republic (APRE), the Resistance Party (PRN) 
and Jose Antonio Alvarado, and then go to Rizo, telling him 
he must make a deal or face sure defeat in November.  Again, 
Aleman would have to step aside.  Both Bolanos and Pellas are 
convinced that a deal must be struck by May 11, the last day 
to register alliances with the CSE.  Neither offered any 
sure-fire way of forcing Aleman to step down; both hinted 
they could live with an Aleman amnesty following the 
elections and both stressed that the Assembly races are 
almost more important than the Presidency given the dreaded 
constitutional reforms set to go into effect 10 days after 
the inauguration in January. 
 
PELLAS' ANALYSIS 
- - - - - - - - - 
 
¶5.  (C) As a follow up to the meeting on the morning of April 
28, late that afternoon Pellas had a copy of his electoral 
analysis of the possible outcomes of a four way race 
delivered to the Embassy.  Based on data from the 2001 
national elections and the 2004 municipal elections, along 
with a handful of assumptions, Pellas sets out three 
scenarios: Best-Case ALN-PC, Best-Case PLC, and Best-Case 
FSLN.  All three scenarios assume that 2.4 million ballots 
will be cast on election day (compared to 2.2 million in 2001 
and 1.665 million in 2004).  Pellas scenarios follow. 
 
¶6.  (C) BEST-CASE ALN-PC: 
 
-The PLC holds its 2004 municipal vote (600,000) but gains 
nothing. 
-The FSLN holds its 2004 municipal vote (728,000) but gains 
nothing. 
E 
 
-Herty Lewites takes 100,000 votes from the 2001 Sandinista 
vote and receives 200,000 independent votes. 
-The ALN-PC takes 648,000 votes. 
-Minor parties take 100,000 votes. 
 
This scenario leads to a presidential runoff between Ortega 
and Montealegre (which Montealegre would certainly win), but 
leaves the PLC and FSLN with a majority (56%) in the National 
Assembly. 
 
¶7.  (C) BEST-CASE PLC: 
 
-The PLC only loses 300,000 votes from 2001, leaving it with 
900,000. 
-The FSLN receives the same number of votes as in 2001 
(900,000). 
-Herty Lewites takes 200,000 independent votes. 
-Minor parties receive 100,000 votes. 
-The ALN-PC takes the leftovers: 300,000 votes. 
 
In this scenario, Rizo and Ortega face a runoff, and the PLC 
and FSLN control 75% of the new National Assembly.  Although 
Pellas does not analyze the results of a runoff between Rizo 
and Ortega, polls have shown that Rizo is the only major 
candidate that Ortega could possibly beat in a head-to-head 
contest. 
 
¶8.  (C) BEST-CASE FSLN: 
 
-The FSLN receives the same number of votes as in 2001 
(900,000). 
-Herty Lewites takes 200,000 independent votes. 
-The PLC holds its 2004 municipal vote (600,000) but gains 
nothing. 
-Minor parties take 100,000 votes. 
-The ALN-PC takes the leftovers: 576,000 votes. 
 
In this scenario, the ALN-PC and PLC divide the Liberal vote 
almost evenly, leaving Ortega and the FSLN far out in front 
with 37.5% of the vote--enough for Ortega to win the 
presidency in the first round. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - 
 
¶9.  (C) It is the third scenario (Best-Case FSLN) that alarms 
Pellas and leads him to conclude that a four way race is 
unacceptable.  However, Pellas does not factor in the 
tendency of Nicaraguan non-FSLN voters to turn to whatever 
candidate seems most likely to beat Ortega as an election 
nears.  It is highly likely that as election day approaches, 
non-Sandinista voters will move en masse towards either the 
PLC or the ALN-PC, depending on which appears to be the most 
viable force.  Pellas also does not factor in that the best 
way to ensure an FSLN defeat would be to sideline Arnoldo 
Aleman and his corrupt clique in the PLC in order to make 
possible a viable liberal alliance and avoid a four-way race.
