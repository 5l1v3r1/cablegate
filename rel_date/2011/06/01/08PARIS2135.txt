¶1.  (C) France shares U.S. concerns about the November 
9 municipal elections in Nicaragua and will issue a 
new statement within days calling for a recount, 
Nicaragua Desk Officer Philippe Garcia de la Rosa told 
Poloff November 20 in response to reftel points.  The 
new MFA statement, which is in the clearance process, 
will a) urge a transparent recount of votes in 
disputed elections, b) appeal for calm and c) condemn 
recent violence against journalists in Nicaragua. 
 
¶2.  (C) France released a statement in its capacity as 
president of the European Union November 14 on 
Nicaragua that called for transparency in counting 
votes.  Nonetheless, the GOF believes continued 
instability on the ground merits a new bilateral 
public expression of concern, Garcia de la Rosa said. 
He added that while it is essential to avoid 
exacerbating the situation, in France's view the 
international community needs to be firm in its 
response to the poor conduct of the election and its 
aftermath.  Garcia de la Rosa pledged to keep Poloff 
informed about France's actions with respect to 
Nicaragua in the coming weeks.
