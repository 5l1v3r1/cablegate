Classified By: Ambassador Hugo Llorens, reasons 1.4 (b & d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: We have been working with Chief of Defense 
General Romeo Vasquez Velasquez to improve 
conditions for President Zelaya's party and Brazilian 
diplomats in the Brazilian chancery.  Vasquez is willing to 
help but has also insisted that Zelaya be more active in 
encouraging his supporters to avoid violence.  Zelaya has 
told us that he met with Micheletti representative Arturo 
Corrales and discussed the possibility of a negotiated 
settlement.  Zelaya said Corrales told him that under no/no 
circumstances would Micheletti allow Zelaya back in power. 
Corrales offered the "Third Option" whereby Micheletti and 
Zelaya would both resign and a constitutional successor would 
be named to run a government of national reconciliation 
through the elections and the January 27, 2010 inauguration 
of a newly-elected head of state.  Zelaya said he was willing 
to accept a modified version of San Jose, but that he would 
not give up his claim to the presidency.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) As per Department instructions, the Ambassador spoke 
the evening of September 23 to regime Chief of Defense 
General Romeo Vasquez Velasquez.  The Ambassador conveyed the 
U.S. position that the regime fully respect the diplomatic 
inviolability of the Brazilian Embassy and wanted to ensure 
that the security forces took effective steps to provide for 
the security of President Zelaya and his family who were in 
the diplomatic compound.  The Ambassador passed on concerns 
expressed by those within the compound, and propagated by the 
rumor mill, that the regime security forces were planning to 
enter the Brazilian Embassy and arrest Zelaya. Vasquez 
assured the Ambassador once again that under no/no 
circumstances would the Honduran military enter the Brazilian 
Embassy and attempt to capture President Zelaya.  He 
described the rumors as "lies" and said they were part of a 
Zelaya campaign to discredit the regime and the military. 
Vasquez reiterated the military's cooperation with the 
Embassy in improving conditions in the Brazilian compound in 
terms of food, water, and the entry and exit of visitors. 
The Ambassador noted that an issue of concern related to 
continued restrictions on the movement of Brazilian 
diplomatic personnel in and out of their chancery.  He said 
that Honduran security forces would allow the Charge free 
movement, but insisted that if he left the chancery his 
vehicle would need to be searched. 
 
¶3. (C) On the morning of September 24, the Ambassador spoke 
again to Vasquez to convey complaints from Brazilian 
diplomats and the Zelaya party regarding conditions within 
the chancery compound.  The Ambassador noted that the 
previous evening security forces had beamed bright lights 
into the compound and mobilized a large contingent of troops 
to the Embassy and positioned some of them in full battle 
gear on the walls of the compound.  The Ambassador stressed 
that the U.S. and the international community insisted on 
fair and humane conditions for those in the compound. 
Vasquez agreed that it was in their interest to improve 
conditions for the Zelaya party and Brazilian diplomats. 
(Note: Later in the morning Vasquez assigned a senior 
military officer to be available to President Zelaya, the 
First Lady and the Brazilian Charge d'Affaires to deal with 
any issues pertaining to conditions within the compound. 
This direct telephone contact has been established. End 
Note). 
 
¶4. (C) Vasquez told the Ambassador that the military did not 
want President Zelaya hurt. He said that the despite their 
differences he considered Zelaya a personal friend.  He added 
that the armed forces were doing everything 
possible to avoid violence.  He noted that the Honduran 
military was on the record as supporting San Jose and 
wanted a negotiated solution.  He warned that the breakout of 
generalized violence and death would lead to chaos and 
catastrophe for the Honduran people.  Vasquez asked the 
Ambassador to approach President Zelaya and urge him to 
instruct his supporters to avoid the use of violence, and to 
stop looting and damaging property.  The Ambassador responded 
 
TEGUCIGALP 00000962  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
that the U.S. has pressed Zelaya to do everything in his 
power to avoid violence and to call for reconciliation. 
However, the Ambassador agreed to pass on his message 
directly to Zelaya. 
 
¶5. (C) Following this conversation the Ambassador spoke to 
President Zelaya and urged him to do everything to 
discourage his supporters from committing acts of violence 
and vandalism.  The Ambassador stressed that the breakdown in 
law and order, the eruption of civil conflict and any 
shedding of blood would be a tragedy for the Honduran nation 
and would be devastating to the political fortunes of himself 
and Roberto Micheletti. Zelaya agreed and said he would go 
back to his supporters in the resistance movement and direct 
them to peaceful activity. 
 
¶6. (C) Zelaya also told the Ambassador that he had met with 
Micheletti Commission member Arturo Corrales late last night. 
 He said that Corrales said the regime was willing to 
negotiate a deal.  Corrales said that under no/no 
circumstances would the Micheletti regime allow him to return 
as President.  He Corrales said that the regime offered the 
Third Option, whereby Micheletti and Zelaya would both resign 
and a constitutional succession would occur (possibly with 
the President of the Supreme Court or the Minister of 
Governance assuming the Presidency).  He said the new 
government of national reconciliation would preside over the 
elections and transfer power to the newly-elected president. 
Zelaya said he responded that he was open to negotiate and he 
was very open to an expanded version of San Jose with 
stronger enforcement mechanisms, but would not countenance 
renouncing the presidency.  Zelaya said he looked forward to 
the meeting with the presidential candidates and expressed 
the hope that they could help bridge the gap between the two 
sides.
