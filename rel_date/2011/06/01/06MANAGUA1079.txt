(C-AL6-00642) 
 
REF: A. STATE 77530 
     ¶B. MANAGUA 0841 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (S/NF) SUMMARY/BACKGROUND: Although Post possesses no 
specific numbers on the level of support Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chavez is providing to Sandinista (FSLN) candidate 
Daniel Ortega, we are certain that Chavez' direct and 
indirect assistance to Ortega is substantial, could well 
reach the tens of millions of dollars, and possibly sway the 
outcome of the November election.  Embassy Managua has not 
seen concrete evidence to corroborate the Liberal 
Constitutional Party's (PLC) contention that Chavez is 
providing USD 50 million in traditional and untraditional 
forms of aid to advance Ortega's political campaign.  We 
believe that the PLC's allegations are in part an effort to 
discredit Ortega to advantage their candidate Jose Rizo and 
to convince the USG and potential private sector campaign 
contributors that the PLC is the only party that can beat 
Ortega in the November 5 election.  Given that the average 
cost of a presidential campaign in Nicaragua is USD 10 
million to 15 million, even if Venezuela's support for Ortega 
is considerably less than the rumored USD 50 million, the 
funds could buy significant influence and possibly exert 
considerable sway over the voting public. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) SUMMARY/BACKGROUND CONTINUED:  Most of Chavez's 
material support to Ortega will likely remain under the radar 
screen of public scrutiny -- in the form of an underground 
network of cash payments (sources assert that several FSLN 
party officials frequently travel to Venezuela and return 
with large sums of cash), or laundered via Chavez's oil for 
Nicaraguan mayors initiative and his fertilizer donations. 
To our knowledge, the Venezuelan government (BRV) is not 
supporting Sandinista dissident Herty Lewites' presidential 
candidacy; Lewites has sharply criticized Chavez' support for 
Ortega and Ortega's willingness to succumb to Chavez's 
influence.  However, we would not be surprised that if 
Lewites emerges as a stronger candidate than Ortega as the 
November election draws nearer, Chavez might approach Lewites 
to offer his help.  We have also heard from GON sources close 
to President Bolanos that the Taiwanese may be prepared to 
provide campaign financing to Liberal dissident Eduardo 
Montealegre.  A summary follows of our knowledge of Chavez' 
support for Ortega thus far.  END SUMMARY/BACKGROUND. 
 
HELOS FOR DANIEL

¶3.  (S/NF) USG sources suggest that Chavez financed the use 
of three helicopters for FSLN use during the March 5 Atlantic 
Coast election. 
 
OIL FOR SANDINISTA MAYORS INITIATIVE 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The centerpiece of BRV support for the FSLN is a 
special oil deal to provide Venezuelan oil to the 
FSLN-dominated national mayor's association (AMUNIC) at 
favorable loan terms for resale at lower than market prices 
on the Nicaraguan market.  The deal is meant to give the FSLN 
the opportunity to both benefit politically from making these 
products available below cost and to convert the profits into 
cash for electioneering.  Ortega and Marenco and a number of 
Nicaraguan mayors traveled to Caracas to sign the oil 
agreement on April 25 between the Venezuelan government and 
AMUNIC.  Responding to criticism that Chavez is intervening 
in Nicaragua's internal affairs, Ortega justified Chavez's 
actions in Nicaragua by labeling them "solidarity" and 
distinguishing them from U.S. "interference." 
 
¶5.  (C) To date, technical issues -- lack of storage 
facilities, no distribution network, etc.) have prevented the 
deal's implementation.  However, the agreement has attracted 
much attention and the public appears to associate the 
initiative with Ortega, as Chavez and Ortega intended.  Some 
interlocutors believe that the Chavez oil deal is not only 
directed at supporting Ortega's campaign, but also meant to 
eventually remove foreign (read U.S.) oil industry influence 
in Nicaragua and replace it with a Venezuelan presence. 
Local executives of ESSO (Exxon Mobile) who run Nicaragua's 
only oil refinery also suspect that Venezuela's oil politics 
are aiming to drive them out of the country, paving the way 
for Venezuela to purchase the refinery at a bargain price. 
 
 
FERTILIZER FOR THE RURAL POOR 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Sandinistas have announced that Chavez has 
promised to donate 50,000 metric tons of urea (a powderized 
fertilizer/animal feed obtained by the reaction of liquid 
ammonia and liquid carbon dioxide from petroleum processing) 
for distribution to the rural poor of Chinandega and Corinto 
by the Sandinista Agricultural Services Cooperative 
(Nicaraocoop).  In an April 12 telephone conversation, Luvy 
Perez, Director of Inspections for the Nicaraguan Customs 
Agency (DGI) confirmed that 11,260 metric tons of urea have 
already arrived from Venezuela and are ready for distribution 
to FSLN-controlled municipalities.  In a press report, the 
president of Nicaraocoop said that the urea is being provided 
below-cost rather than as a donation, although Sandinista 
officials called it a donation when they announced the 
program with great fanfare.  FSLN opponents, including 
Sandinista dissident/presidential contender Herty Lewites, 
claim that the urea is part of Chavez's electoral aid package 
for the FSLN. 
 
LITERACY CAMPAIGN - YO SI PUEDO 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The Venezuelans are also funding the 
Cuban-administered literacy campaign "Yo Si Puedo" ("Yes I 
Can").  While technically open to any city in Nicaragua (in 
order to receive GON permission to operate), the program was 
originally only offered to FSLN-controlled local governments 
and only FSLN governments are now participating.  Despite 
earlier reports that the GON had planned to deny the 
Sandinista-oriented Augusto C. Sandino Foundation (FACS) 
permission to import equipment needed for the program, recent 
press reports state that the GON capitulated and the 
materials have entered.  The equipment consists of 5,000 
televisions, 5,000 VCRs and a large amount of training 
materials (including 500,000 workbooks).  The estimated cost 
of the three-year program is USD 21.6 million.  The Office of 
the Mayor of Managua has begun airing television commercials 
to sell the program and the Mayor of Masaya's office has 
posted billboards. 
 
MEDICAL CLINICS 
- - - - - - - - 
 
¶8.  (U) The BRV has launched its campaign to provide surgical 
eye care in Venezuela for 3,000 poor Nicaraguans; the first 
120 patients traveled to Venezuela the week of April 17. 
Administered by the FSLN-run Office of the Mayor of Managua, 
the program also covers airfare and room and board.  The 
departure and return of the first group drew ample media 
coverage.  Nicaraguan media were provided free trips to 
Venezuela to cover the event and were also likely paid to 
present it with great fanfare. 
 
FEEDING ORTEGA'S PROPAGANDA MACHINE 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶9.  (S/NF) Post has heard a number of reports that Chavez is 
generously funding Ortega's media campaign, including the 
provision of transmitters and other hardware, as well as air 
space and press footage.  For example, the Sandinista-leaning 
station in Esteli has reportedly received four television 
cameras, two 20K watt transmitters, and two network interface 
systems from the Venezuelans. 
 
CHAVEZ'S ATTEMPT TO DISGUISE POLITICAL BIAS 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - 
 
¶10.  (C) After drawing consideraQe criticism from non-FSLN 
political circles, Chavez has made some efforts to cover the 
politicalQias of his programs.  For example, he invited a 
 
number of PLC mayors to attend the signing of the 
PDVSA-AMUNIC accord in Caracas on April 24.  Despite orders 
from PLC leadership to its mayors not to participate, six PLC 
mayors traveled to Caracas for the event. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - 
 
¶11.  (S/NF) Although we do not have information on the scope 
of Venezuelan support for Ortega, clearly its assistance is 
substantial.  Further, unlike USG aid restrictions, much of 
 
the Chavez support is not tied to the normal limitations of 
foreign assistance.  Complicating the situation is Nicaraguan 
electoral law, which permits foreign campaign donations with 
few restrictions that are easy to overcome.  Leaders of 
non-FSLN parties frequently warn us that unless the United 
States counters this surge of Venezuelan aid, the electoral 
playing field will be grossly uneven in favor of Ortega.
