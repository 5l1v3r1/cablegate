¶1. (U) On November 29, we delivered REFTEL non-paper to Dr. 
Juan Jose Amador Velazquez, the Director General for 
Epidemiology at the Ministry of Health (MINSA).  On Novermber 
30, we delivered the non-paper to Dr. Mario Jose Gonzalez 
Herrera, Chief of the Department of Epidemiology at the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAGFOR).  Both were 
appreciative of the notification about the conference and 
were interested in exploring the possibility of travel funded 
by FAO.  Both Amador and Gonzalez concurred that the possible 
outbreak of Avian Influenza in the Western Hempishere was a 
major concern and provided us with short briefings on the 
existing mechanisms in place at each Ministry to monitor and 
detect any such outbreak. Most interesting was the fact that 
MINSA has in place a nation-wide radio network through which 
the Ministry recieves daily communication and health status 
reporting from the field.  Amador also noted that MINSA has 
regular communications with its counterparts throughout 
Central America, including on the topic of Avian Influenza. 
Both Amador and Gonzalez indicated keen interest in having 
Nicaragua represented at the New Delhi Conference and 
determined to raise the issue immediately with their 
respective Ministers.  (Note: Currently all foreign travel by 
Nicaraguan officials must be personally approved in advance 
by First Lady Rosario Murillo.  Both Amador and Gonzalez were 
keen to attend, but were unsure that there was sufficient 
time to clear the travel request with the First Lady.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
¶2. (U) We also transmitted the information about the New 
Delhi Conference via Diplomatic Note to the Foreign Ministry 
on November 29, and hand delivered copies to our Health and 
Agriculture Ministry contacts. In addition, on November 28 
talking points on the conference were discussed with Dr. 
Carolina Davila, the Special Assistant to Minister Gonzalez, 
while MINSA's coordinator for International Programs, Rosa 
Argentina Madriz, was sent the non-paper, the conference's 
program agenda and Website. Finally, we included the same 
information in a previously-planned letter from the 
Ambassador to the new Minister of Health regarding several 
pending issues of bilateral interest.
