REF: TEGUCIGALPA 658 AND PREVIOUS 
 
 ¶1. (U) Summary: This is another in a series of daily 
round-ups of political news in the aftermath of the June 28 
forcible removal and exile of President Manuel Zelaya from 
Honduras.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Zelaya Spends the Weekend at the Border 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Zelaya spent July 24 - 27 on the border of Nicaragua 
and Honduras, where he called upon his supporters to 
"maintain the resistance."  Arias stated publicly that 
Zelaya's presence at the border was not helping Honduras 
reach a peaceful resolution. 
 
¶3. (U) The border crossing at Las Manos across from where 
Zelaya has been encamped July 23-27 is the key commercial 
entry point along the route that connects Panama, Costa Rica 
and Nicaragua to the northern ports of Honduras.  An 
estimated 500 trucks headed for Puerto Cortes in Honduras 
were trapped at the Nicaraguan border over the weekend. 
Military presence and curfews along the Honduras/Nicaragua 
border have hurt commercial activity.  De facto Defense 
Minister Adolfo Leonel Sevilla said that they are working 
with the Department of El Paraiso and the border towns to 
restore normalcy to the commercial and daily life of the 
department. 
 
¶4. (U) The Armed Forces (HOAF) leadership publicly stated 
over the weekend that they support the San Jose agreement. 
Chief of Defense MG Romeo Vasquez Velasquez affirmed that the 
HOAF is under instructions not to fire upon the people and 
that the only weapons they carry are clubs, shields, and 
teargas. 
 
------------------ 
Reactions to CODEL 
------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) Pro-Micheletti "El Heraldo" reported July 26 that 
Congressman Connie Mack had clearly stated before arriving in 
Honduras that Zelaya's removal was not a coup and that the 
judicial bodies and the National Congress abided by the 
constitution when they acted.  Local press reported that de 
facto Minister of Foreign Affairs Carlos Lopez Contreras said 
that the U.S. Congressmen who visited Honduras July 25 - 26 
saw the reality of the situation in Honduras and that the 
U.S. media has not accurately portrayed the political 
situation.  He stated that Zelaya has to choose between 
staying at the border and re-entering into dialogue. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Zelaya Supporters Vow to Continue Strikes 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) The labor and teachers unions who support Zelaya 
announced July 27 that they will continue with roadblocks and 
strikes by all public employees.  The Federation of Honduran 
Teachers (FOMH) announced that July 27 they will begin a 
general and indefinite strike.  This time the strike will 
reportedly include both public and private schools. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Press Highlights Corruption in Zelaya Administration 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶7. (U) "El Heraldo" reported that, according to the Public 
Ministry, USD 6.7 million of public money was spent to fund 
the fourth urn and that an addition USD 2.6 million was 
illegally taken from the Central Bank.  (Note: It is 
difficult to gauge the veracity of these allegations.  There 
are indications that Zelaya was using public funds for his 
Fourth Urn campaign.  However, in the wake of the coup, the 
Micheletti regime has aggressively sought to prosecute Zelaya 
officials and seems bent on applying "the law for my 
enemies," which undermines the credibility of these legal 
procedures.  End Note.) 
 
--------------------------------------- 
TSE Advocates for November 29 Elections 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (U) Local press reports that the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal (TSE) will propose that elections take place 
 
TEGUCIGALP 00000662  002 OF 002 
 
 
November 29 as planned, saying it would be logistically 
difficult to change the election date (Comment: Post's own 
assessment is that moving the date earlier would indeed 
require a significant increase in funding to the TSE, but is 
feasible.  End Comment.).  The TSE espects to have the 
economic support of the international community for elections 
and believes that the legitimate and transparent electoral 
process will normalize the political situation in Honduras.

Ambassador Holds Off-the-record Meeting with Honduran Press 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶9. (C) Ambasssador Llorens held an off-the-record meeting 
with members of the Honduran press to reiterate the U.S. 
position and reinforce the idea that despite our 
non-recognition of the de facto government, the Ambassador 
has remained in country with a low profile to continue 
working towards reestablishing the democratic and 
constitutional order and in support of President Arias' 
mediation.  The Ambassador took questions on our policy 
regarding foreign assistance to Honduras, possible revocation 
of de facto regime member's visas and our USG position on 
allegations of  human rights violations.  In attendance were 
reporters from La Tribuna, Tiempo, El Heraldo, El Patriota 
and Hondudiario for print; Radio HRN, Radio America, Radio 
Globo and Radio Cadena Voces for radio; and channels 11, 30, 
42, 36, 13 and Telenoticias for local television.
