AUTHOR OF ORTEGA'S JUDICIAL COUP GETS EGGED 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In the early morning of October 22, Supreme Court Justice 
(CSJ) Magistrate Francisco Rosales was pelted with several dozen 
eggs by a number of unidentified youth as he was exiting his 
vehicle and entering the building of 100% Noticias, a Managua 
television station for an interview.  It is widely believed that 
Rosales was attacked because of his role as President of the 
Constitutional Chamber of the CSJ that issued a decision on Monday 
evening, October 19, permitting Daniel Ortega's re-election (see 
ref A).  A very flustered and visibly incensed Rosales claimed that 
the egg-throwers were the children of leftist politicians.  On the 
Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) radio station YA, 
Rosales subsequently blamed the United States Embassy for the 
attack.  Rosales stated on October 23, that "the anti-social 
(perpetrators) involved in the attack were paid directly by the 
Embassy of the United States to do these acts of violence."

RETALIATION?

¶2. (SBU) On October 22, a group of Daniel Ortega supporters 
assaulted Leonor Martinez, an activist in the Civil Coordinator 
(CC), a left-of-center NGO.  Martinez was walking in the street 
after a CC press conference, when a black van with the FSLN flag 
flying on it pulled up to her.  Of the four men in the van, three 
came out and put a gun to her head and a dagger to her side.  Then, 
the three men twisted her arm behind her back-breaking it-and threw 
her to the ground.  They proceeded to threaten her and her family 
while insinuating that she should stop her work with the CC, 
presumably because of its anti-Ortega stance.

CONNECTION TO EARLIER CIVIL SOCIETY REPRESSION 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The fourth man, who stayed in the van, identified himself 
as Armando Arroliga (better known as "El Gato").  Arroliga works in 
the Managua Mayor's Office and was a prominent leader of the 
FSLN-led assault against a peaceful protest that took place at the 
Managua Cathedral on August 8 (see ref B).  Martinez, supported by 
human rights defender Vilma Nunez, described her attack to the 
press outside the hospital where she later received emergency 
surgery to set the bone in her broken arm.  Nunez claimed that 
Rosales stated he "would send the Sandinista Youth" out to avenge 
his egging.

COMMENT 
 
------------- 
 
¶4. (C) This most recent example of FSLN-sympathizers seeking to 
silence and intimidate members of civil society is representative 
of a larger trend toward the suppression of the public airing of 
opposition viewpoints.  Given that the recent Nicaraguan Supreme 
Court (CSJ) ruling has further polarized and aggravated the 
already-tense political climate (see reftel B), attacks against 
opposition voices will very likely increase in number and severity. 
While there is no evidence that the violent attack against Leonor 
Martinez is tied directly to the egging of Rosales, it has become 
clear that the FSLN officials and their minions are reacting very 
aggressively to all forms of criticism of their party decisions.
