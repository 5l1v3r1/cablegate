SUBJECT: GON WILL RE-SEND REQUEST FOR DOMINICAN ASSISTANCE 
IN ALEMAN CASE--THIS TIME WITH DIP NOTE 
 
REF: A. SANTO DOMINGO 287 
 
     ¶B. SANTO DOMINGO 344 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR PAUL TRIVELLI. REASONS 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1. (C) The Nicaraguan government will re-send its June 2005 
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) request for Dominican 
assistance in the money laundering investigation of 
ex-President Arnoldo Aleman.  This time the request will be 
accompanied by a GON diplomatic note to the Dominican Foreign 
Ministry formally requesting the assistance. 
 
¶2. (C) On February 3, poloff and RLA met MFA Americas 
Director Domingo Salinas and Attorney General for Criminal 
Affairs Ivan Lara to discuss the issues raised in reftels and 
emphasize the need for a Nicaraguan diplomatic note formally 
requesting the assistance of the Dominican government.  Lara 
explained that under the Inter-American Convention on Mutual 
Assistance in Criminal Matters, no diplomatic note is 
necessary; for that reason his office had simply submitted an 
MLAT request via diplomatic channels in June 2005.  Lara 
added that his office has received excellent cooperation in 
the Aleman investigation from the USG and the Government of 
Panama without such formalities.  However, Lara is willing to 
work with the MFA to re-submit the 2005 MLAT request along 
with a diplomatic note if it would facilitate cooperation 
with the Dominican government.  Lara promised to deliver the 
MLAT documents to the MFA on February 6, and Salinas will 
have the diplomatic note ready and send the entire package to 
the Nicaraguan Embassy in Santo Domingo during the week of 
February 6-10. 
 
¶3. (C) Lara told emboffs that when he met Dominican Attorney 
General Francisco Dominguez Brito to request assistance in 
the Aleman case in May 2005, he received the impression that 
Dominguez Brito was not interested in investigating the case, 
possibly because evidence might arise of prominent Dominicans 
being involved with Aleman's illicit transactions.  Lara 
speculated that Dominguez Brito might now have had a change 
of heart because of his senate run, and might be seeking to 
protect himself from allegations of inaction in the Aleman 
case.  Once the diplomatic note and MLAT request are formally 
received by the Dominican government, Lara suggested that 
subsequent bilateral cooperation should be less formal, and 
more analogous to that between his office and its 
counterparts in the U.S. and Panama. 
 
¶4. (C) Post will follow up with Lara and the MFA to ensure 
that the diplomatic note and MLAT request are sent, and would 
appreciate Embassy Santo Domingo's follow up thereafter to 
confirm that the documents have been received by the 
appropriate Dominican government offices.
