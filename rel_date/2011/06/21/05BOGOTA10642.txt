Classified By: Political Counselor Jeffrey DeLaurentis; 
Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
(C) Poloff met with MFA Coordinator for Latin America and the 
Caribbean Hector Arenas Neira on November 10 to urge Colombia 
to deny safe haven to former Nicaraguan president Arnoldo 
Aleman should it be sought.  Arenas did not specifically 
address the request to deny visas to Aleman and his family, 
but said he would discuss the issue with colleagues at the 
MFA.  He said the GOC has no information on any corrupt 
proceeds Aleman or his associates may have deposited in 
Colombia at present, but would inform the Embassy if funds 
were discovered.  Arenas noted that Colombia has a close 
relationship with Nicaragua and is concerned about the 
institutional crisis facing Nicaraguan democracy.  He said 
Colombia supports efforts to strengthen democratic 
institutions in Nicaragua.
