PROJECT PROPOSAL 
 
REF: A. 05 STATE 221183 
 
     ¶B. MANAGUA 230 
 
¶1. In reftel B, Embassy Managua submitted an anti-trafficking 
in persons (TIP) project proposal to the Department that 
focuses on strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of 
Government to fight trafficking.  Subsequently, post learned 
that the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Overseas 
Prosecutorial, Development Assistance and Training (OPDAT) 
program submitted a separate proposal to the Department that 
would offer training to various Nicaraguan anti-TIP actors. 
 
¶2. Post's anti-TIP working group has been in contact with 
OPDAT to discuss OPDAT's project proposal, and has encouraged 
OPDAT to narrow its original submission to focus on two key 
areas: training to enhance the capacity of key Nicaraguan law 
enforcement officials (prosecutors, investigators, and border 
officials) and a regional anti-TIP conference for key 
government and non-government TIP specialists.  This 
conference would be held in Managua and would focus on 
Nicaragua as a TIP source country and Nicaragua's Central 
American neighbors as the primary destination for most 
Nicaraguan TIP victims. It would seek to increase regional 
cooperation in preventing trafficking from Nicaragua, 
prosecuting traffickers, and repatriating Nicaraguan victims. 
 Post understands that OPDAT has already submitted this 
modified proposal to the Department. 
 
¶3. Although the project proposal post already submitted 
(reftel B) remains our top funding priority, we believe that 
the modified OPDAT proposal would dovetail well with our 
previous submission, and would help to address one of the 
anti-TIP weaknesses that the Department has highlighted in 
its annual TIP reports on Nicaragua: the relative lack of 
effective prosecutions of traffickers caused by poor 
interinstitutional cooperation and flawed police gathering of 
evidence. 
 
¶4. In addition to assisting the development of an operational 
handbook for the effective investigation and prosecution of 
TIP cases, OPDAT's proposal will encourage the law 
enforcement institutions to analyze Nicaragua's current laws 
and recommend changes to the current substantive criminal and 
procedural laws that will recognize the modus operandi of 
organized crime in these offenses and improve enforcement 
operations by giving the police the procedural tools 
necessary to conduct more proactive, large-scale 
investigations and prosecutions and prosecutors the ability 
to preserve victim testimony.  Embassy Managua thus endorses 
the modified OPDAT proposal and, if sufficient money is 
available, requests that the Department fund both post's 
original submission and the modified OPDAT proposal.
