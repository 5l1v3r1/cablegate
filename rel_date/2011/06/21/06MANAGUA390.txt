Classified By: AMBASSADOR PAUL TRIVELLI. REASONS 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(C) During a February 16 conversation with the Ambassador, 
Foreign Minister Norman Caldera stated that the GON is firmly 
behind Guatemala in its competition with Venezuela for the 
2007-2008 Latin America non-permanent seat on the UN Security 
Council.  Caldera reported that the plan is to win a full 
regional Central American endorsement for Guatemala at an 
upcoming Central American Integration System (SICA) meeting. 
Caldera foresees no problems with any of the other countries 
in the region, except for the Dominican Republic.  According 
to Caldera, the GOV has promised the GODR a new oil refinery 
in return for its vote.  Caldera pledged that the GON will 
help us in any way it can via lobbying other countries or 
regions should we deem such action helpful.
