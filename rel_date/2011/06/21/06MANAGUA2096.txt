(U)  On September 12, the Nicaraguan Civil Aviation 
Administration (Direccion General de Aeronautica Civil) 
celebrated the placing of the cornerstone of the future Civil 
Aviation Institute (Instituto Nicaraguense de Aeronautica 
Civil) at Managua International Airport.  Highlights included 
remarks by Vice President Alfredo Gomez and representatives 
from the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure and the 
Central American Corporation of Air Navigation Services.  On 
behalf of President Enrique Bolanos, the Vice President 
lauded progress toward the achievement of that end, 
foreseeing increased international commerce to the benefit of 
Central America.  He added that Nicaragua's enterprising 
spirit, CAFTA, and collaboration with American civil aviation 
experts boded well for trade and enhanced international 
communication.  The creation of an independent civil aviation 
entity is central to Nicaragua's achieving Category I status 
vis a vis the United States.
