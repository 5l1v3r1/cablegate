SUBJECT: SECRETARY LEAVITT,S MEETING WITH PANAMANIAN VICE 
PRESIDENT LEWIS AND HEALTH MINISTER ALLEYNE 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: On January 9, 2007, the U.S. Presidential 
Delegation (Presdel), led by Health and Human Services (HHS) 
Secretary Michael Leavitt, discussed with Panamanian Vice 
President Samuel Lewis and Health Minister Camilo Alleyne a 
new regional health-care training initiative.  Alleyne 
reiterated his Government's commitment to the initiative and 
offered to assist with the drafting of a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) and other deliberations.  Vice President 
Lewis conveyed his interest in a Millennium Challenge Account 
(MCA) program for his country, even though he recognizes 
Panama's GDP exceeds the eligibility threshold.  End Summary. 
 
GOP is Ready for Health Initiative

¶2.  (SBU) Secretary Leavitt outlined his vision for the new 
regional health initiative, whose centerpiece is a regional 
training facility in Panama that will train hundreds of 
health workers from the region -- in particular nurses, 
technicians, community health workers and other health 
providers from rural areas.  He thanked Vice President Lewis 
and Health Minister Alleyne for the Panamanian Government's 
(GOP) support for the initiative.  An enthused Alleyne 
replied that he is "ready to begin," noting the proposed site 
for the training academy, a hospital at the former Howard Air 
Force Base in the reverted Canal Zone, will be readily 
accessible and could even offer specialized surgery.  He 
shared he had discussed the initiative with his Nicaraguan 
counterpart, incoming Health Minister Maritza Quant, who was 
receptive.  Alleyne added that Panama has already recruited a 
group of indigenous medical students to start training 
shortly.  He next referred to the GOP's desire to use the 
project to help Panama achieve its United Nations Millennium 
Development goals. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Secretary described the next steps in the 
program: drafting an MOU, visiting the participating 
countries, and possibly signing the agreement in a regional 
venue.  Alleyne offered to help draft the MOU and to 
undertake additional activities to facilitate negotiations 
and prompt implementation.  He promised to send his input on 
the text of the MOU to the Secretary by late January.  He 
suggested a team from Central American Health Ministries then 
travel to Washington to  negotiate the MOU with Secretary 
Leavitt and his team.  The Secretary thanked Alleyne for his 
offer and suggested that, following the Washington meeting, 
he could travel to the region in the March 15-April 15 
timeframe to finalize the document and promote the program. 
To the Secretary's query regarding a venue to launch the 
health initiative, Lewis suggested the Organization of 
American States meeting of Heads of State in Panama in June 
2007, or perhaps during the System of Integration of Central 
America meeting, to be held in Belize in the spring. 
 
We Want MCC Too

¶4.  (SBU) Vice President Lewis almost rhetorically noted 
Panama's desire to participate in a MCA program and asserted 
Panama's GDP does not reflect the reality that 40 percent of 
Panama's population is poor.  (Note:  Panama's income per 
capita well exceeds the eligibility threshold for MCC 
assistance.  End Note.)
