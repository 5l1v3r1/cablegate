SUBJECT: FOREIGN MINISTER JAMES HUANG ON REGIONAL ISSUES 
AND DOMESTIC POLITICS 
 
 
Classified By: AIT Director Stephen M. Young, Reason 1.4 (b/d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Summary:  The Director discussed recent developments 
in East Asia, Central America, and Taiwan domestic politics 
with Foreign Minister James Huang (Chih-fang) on October 12. 
Huang reiterated Taipei's support for U.S. policy on North 
Korea and said regional instability underscored the need for 
Taipei to also improve its informal cooperation with Japan on 
security matters.  On Vietnam, Huang said Taipei has delinked 
the APEC envoy issue with the question of Vietnam's WTO 
accession.  Huang reiterated ongoing concerns about Beijing's 
influence in Central America, in particular Nicaragua and 
Guatemala. Turning to Taiwan domestic politics, Huang noted 
that the National Day protests tarnished Taiwan's 
international image.  Huang expressed optimism that some 
elements of Taiwan's current defense budget could pass in the 
legislature this year. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C)  The Director, accompanied by DDIR and notetaker, 
discussed recent developments in East Asia with Foreign 
Minister James Huang (Chih-fang) on October 12. In response 
to the Director's appreciation for Taiwan's public 
condemnation of the North Korea nuclear test, Huang explained 
that Taiwan was quick to issue the statement because Taipei 
firmly supports maintaining regional stability.  Huang later 
added that North Korean instability underscores the need for 
Taipei and Tokyo to cooperate informally on regional security 
matters. 
 
¶3.  (C)  The Director informed Huang that Vietnam will send 
an envoy to Taipei with a second letter on the APEC agenda 
next week.  Huang reiterated Taipei's view that one special 
envoy, instead of two, is a departure from past practice, 
demurring that nevertheless Taipei will "see how it goes." 
He said Taipei has already delinked the APEC envoy issue from 
the issue of Vietnam's WTO accession. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Huang thanked the U.S. for its continuing 
cooperation with Taipei on Central American affairs, in 
particular the series of meetings scheduled for Vice Minister 
Javier Hou with administration officials and experts on 
Central America.  Huang characterized the region as an 
"important" area where Taipei and Washington share common 
interests.  He further expressed Taipei's continuing concern 
over the November elections in Nicaragua.  Huang said he may 
also travel to Guatemala after his meeting with regional 
TECRO representatives in Seattle next week to discuss with 
the Guatemalan Vice President and Foreign Minister the status 
of their recent high-level exchanges with Beijing. 
 
¶5.  (C) Turning to Taiwan domestic politics, Huang noted that 
protests organized by the "Depose Chen" campaign on National 
Day tarnished Taiwan's international image.  He regretted the 
harassment of foreign delegations and said campaign leader 
Shih Ming-te needs to be given a way to step down gracefully. 
 Huang predicted that the October 13 vote to recall President 
Chen was doomed to fail.  He surmised that opposition 
Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou would probably have to move 
on a no-confidence motion against the cabinet to convince 
pan-Blue supporters he has the ability to lead.  Such a move, 
however, would pit KMT legislators in northern urban areas 
who support the motion against legislators from central and 
southern Taiwan who feel they have the most to lose if 
President Chen decides to dissolve the Legislative Yuan (LY) 
and hold a snap election instead of replacing the Premier. 
 
¶6.  (C)  In response to the Director's query on the status of 
the pending defense spending bill, Huang said an opposition 
lawmaker had recently assured him the measure would pass, but 
with some significant cuts.  The P3C anti-submarine aircraft, 
assessed Huang, are on the top of the priority list and have 
the best chance of passing in the opposition-controlled LY. 
The PAC-II upgrades are also possible, though the PAC-IIIs 
and submarine purchases are "under the waterline."  Huang 
added that the recent North Korea test might force the 
opposition to reconsider approving PAC-III purchases.  
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶7.  (C)  Foreign Minister Huang, congenial and soft-spoken as 
usual, continues to raise with AIT concerns over the upcoming 
Nicaraguan elections and the state of relations between 
Beijing and Taipei's key allies in Central America.  His 
planned trip to Guatemala is one of a series of recent visits 
to the region and underscores that Taipei feels vulnerable to 
Beijing's overtures toward long-standing Central American 
allies.
