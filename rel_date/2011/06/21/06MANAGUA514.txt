Classified By: AMBASSADOR PAUL TRIVELLI. REASONS 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(C) On March 7, Foreign Minister Norman Caldera told the 
Ambassador that the "friends group" idea for promoting 
Guatemala in its race with Venezuela for a non-permanent seat 
on the U.N. Security Council has merit and that the GON would 
be glad to assist as needed.  In the GON's view, the first 
step is to formally secure all Central American support in 
order to forestall any Rio Group endorsement being engineered 
by Venezuela.  The GON will attempt to secure a Central 
American declaration in favor of Guatemala at the meeting of 
the Central American Integration System (SICA) that starts on 
March 8.
