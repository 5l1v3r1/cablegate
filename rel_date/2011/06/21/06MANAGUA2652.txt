SUBJECT: ALN BLOCKS SOME PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS OF 
LEGISLATIVE REFORMS 
 
REF: MANAGUA 2646 
 
Classified By: Charge d'affaires Peter M. Brennan. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: The Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN) 
partially succeeded in minimizing the effects of a ways and 
means law supported by "pacted" Sandinista National 
Liberation Front (FSLN) and Liberal Constitutional Party 
(PLC) caucuses (Reftel).  Vigorous ALN lobbying efforts 
prompted the removal of some of the most egregious articles 
of the "Organic Law" -- including a provision tailor-made to 
facilitate amnesty for PLC caudillo/convicted money launderer 
Arnoldo Aleman.  However, the provision allowing for a secret 
vote remains, as does the legislature's new authority to 
summon Nicaraguan or foreign entities or individuals to 
appear under oath before the Assembly, or face legal 
proceedings that could lead to incarceration.  ALN caucus 
president Maria Eugenia Sequeira seeks more assistance to 
help the ALN prepare its new lawmakers and to enable the ALN 
and civil society counter the machinations of the FSLN-PLC 
pact in the Assembly.  End Summary. 
 
AMNESTY PROVISION SQUASHED 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶2.  (C) ALN caucus president Maria Eugenia Sequeira related 
to polcouns on December 6 that the ALN was partially 
successful in its efforts to minimize the effects of a ways 
and means law that was supported by the "pacted" FSLN and PLC 
caucuses (Reftel).  She recounted how vigorous ALN lobbying 
had led to the removal of some of the most egregious articles 
of the "Organic Law" -- including articles 156-157, which 
would have allowed the Human Rights Commission to grant 
amnesty without requiring a majority vote in the Assembly for 
a range of crimes -- a provision tailor-made to facilitate 
amnesty for PLC caudillo/convicted money launderer Arnoldo 
Aleman. 
 
WHILE ALN RAISES THE BAR ON SOME OF THE PROCEDURAL CHANGES

¶3.  (SBU) According to Sequeira, thanks to ALN efforts, the 
vote thresholds were raised on a number of the procedural 
changes: 
 
-- Convocation of plenary sessions (Article 8):  The 
threshold to call for a special plenary session was raised 
from the proposed 33 deputies to a simple majority of 47. 
 
-- Nomination of Executive Board candidates (Article 34): The 
provision stipulating that only the heads of caucuses may 
propose members for the Executive Board (instead of allowing 
any deputy to run) was removed. 
 
--Removal of Executive Board members (Article 38): The 
threshold required to remove a member of the Executive Board 
was raised from 33 votes to a simple majority of 47. 
 
BUT SOME DRACONIAN MEASURES REMAIN

¶4.  (C) The ALN did not succeed in all of its efforts to 
dampen the bill, however.  Most disconcerting was the 
Assembly's approval of a provision allowing the Executive 
Board to conduct secret votes and Article 53, which grants 
Assembly authority to issue legal summons to Nicaraguan or 
foreign entities or individuals to appear under oath before 
the Assembly.  Failure to appear could lead to the Public 
Ministry's conducting of legal proceedings against the person 
or entity and possibly incarceration.  Terming the Assembly's 
new summons authority "a totalitarian inquisition," Sequeira 
mentioned she had raised her concerns with the Spanish 
Ambassador, who at first did not appear alarmed by the new 
measure.  He first commented to Sequeira that his embassy 
officials enjoy immunity and many countries have similar 
provisions on their books.  However, after Sequeira reminded 
him that Spanish investors and other Spaniards without 
diplomatic immunity would be subject to the partisan whims of 
the Assembly, he reportedly conceded that the Assembly could 
abuse this new authority to coerce foreigners. 
 
MIXED REVIEWS ON MODIFICATIONS OF ARTICLE 40 
- - - - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Sequeira reported that the Assembly decided to 
lower the threshold required for deputies to modify the daily 
legislative agenda from 33 votes to only 20.  While on the 
one hand, the lower threshold would allow the ALN caucus to 
propose changes to the agenda, Sequeira personally believes 
changes from the floor should require the simple majority of 
47 votes. 
 
LAW REQUIRES PRESIDENTIAL SIGNATURE 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Regarding the debate over whether or not the new 
law requires the Executive's signature, Sequeira clarified 
that because it is a law, President Bolanos must sign it for 
it to go into effect.  She explained that the previous 
Assembly regulations did not require the Executive's 
signature because they were merely internal guidelines that 
did not give the Assembly the powers the new law will accord 
it. 
 
DIRE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE EXPERTISE 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
¶7.  (C) Sequeira attributed some of the ALN's lobby success 
to the expertise of constitutional lawyer Gabriel Alvarez, 
noting that IRI had helped cover his honoraria.  She said 
that the ALN will require additional legislative expertise to 
help it train new lawmakers and counter the machinations of 
the FSLN and PLC in the Assembly.  Polcouns urged Sequeira to 
continue raising these valid concerns with the media and to 
seek support from the OAS, Carter Center, EU, as well as 
civil society. 
 
COMMENT 
- - - - 
 
¶8.  (C)  Sequeira will provide us a copy of the law with its 
revisions once she obtains it.  On December 6, Carter Center 
representative David Dye told poloff that the Carter Center 
is disturbed by several elements of the new law, especially 
the ability for the Assembly to conduct secret voting -- a 
provision that will relieve lawmakers of any accountability 
to their constituencies and which could shelter the "guilty 
parties" in any amnesty vote for Aleman.  We will continue to 
raise our concerns with other embassies and domestic and 
foreign civil society leaders.
