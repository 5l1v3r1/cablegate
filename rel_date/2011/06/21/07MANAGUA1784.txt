SUBJECT: MRS CELEBRATES A DAY OF ANTI-DANIELISMO 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador P. Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: While the FSLN celebrated its high holy day 
on July 19, 2007, the Movimiento Renovador Sandinista (The 
Sandinista Renovation Movement, or MRS), a Sandinista 
break-off party, turned their modest celebrations into a day 
of protest against the growing authoritarianism of President 
Daniel Ortega.  The MRS's many accusations against the 
President do not represent a new position, but former MRS 
presidential candidate Edmundo Jarquin did make an 
unprecedented call for multiparty political unity against the 
FSLN. This alteration in rhetoric may herald an alliance with 
liberal opposition parties in the upcoming municipal 
elections. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The Movimiento Renovador Sandinista (The Sandinista 
Renovation Movement, or MRS), a Sandinista break-off group, 
turned the 28th anniversary of the Somoza defeat into a day 
of protest against the growing authoritarianism of President 
Ortega.  The moderately attended event (Embassy unofficial 
estimate of approximately one thousand) was held outside the 
capital for the second year, in the nearby city of Masaya, to 
avoid competition with the much larger FSLN rally taking 
place the same day in Managua. The MRS celebration was half 
cultural event, half political rally, but its message was 
clear: Down with Daniel.  Flyers were distributed reading 
&Daniel: To Every Dictator His July 178, referring to the 
day in 1979 when Somoza fled Nicaragua.  Over the center of 
the stage flew a banner quoting Herty Lewites, &I was born 
under one dictatorship; I don,t want to die under another 
one.8 On stage, organizers led the spectators in chants of 
&Authoritarianism: No! Democracy: Yes!8 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The culmination of the event was the speech by the 
former MRS presidential candidate Edmundo Jarquin, who roused 
the crowd with his eloquent criticism of the President.  No 
specific transgression was highlighted, but the many offenses 
he attributed to Ortega included: causing an increase in 
unemployment and inflation rates and a decrease in 
investment; holding pointless meetings with the President of 
Iran instead of a potentially beneficial one with the 
President of Costa Rica; refusing to include Petronic 
revenues in the national budget; criminalizing therapeutic 
abortion; and trying to consolidate personal and party power 
through the Consejos de Poder Cuidadano (Citizen,s 
Councils).  After listing each one of the misdeeds, Jarquin 
asked the crowd, &Is this governing for the poor?8 Jarquin 
also condemned the President,s method of managing foreign 
assistance, saying, &Daniel Ortega is the only idiot in the 
region who believes that accepting Chavez,s aid means 
refusing the aid of other countries.8 
 
¶4. (SBU)  After denouncing Ortega, Jarquin continued onto a 
more positive note, reminding the audience that the first 
July 19 would not have been possible without the spirit of 
unity that inspired groups from all ends of the political 
spectrum to join together against Somoza.  Similarly, he 
said, &open minds8 and a willingness to work with diverse 
political parties are required to counter the 
&polarization8 that benefits Ortega.  Jarquin specified the 
upcoming municipal elections as the opportunity to put aside 
&ideological suspicion8 and unite, because &what is at 
risk is our democracy.8 
 
¶5. (C) Comment:  Jarquin,s emphasis on unity against Ortega 
above all else is striking, perhaps signaling that MRS is 
prepared to ally with one of the liberal opposition parties 
in the municipal elections.  If so, such cooperation would be 
a significant departure from their previous determination to 
represent the unsullied, independent left.  Jarquin may also 
be trying to attract to the party the small but growing 
number of Sandinistas who do not agree with the actions of 
President Ortega, his wife, and their coterie, or who feel 
left out of the current Sandinista power structure.  While 
the MRS has a relatively small following, the July 19 rally 
showed that they may play an increasingly productive role in 
Nicaraguan politics in the future. End Comment.
