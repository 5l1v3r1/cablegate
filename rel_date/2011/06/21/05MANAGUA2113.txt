¶1.  Post received a letter dated July 14, 2005, from Minister 
of Trade, Industry and Development (MIFIC) Azucena Castillo 
in response to ref a demarche.  The letter informs us that 
Eduardo Castillo, Nicaragua's alternate WTO representative, 
spoke on the subject of Food Aid in the WTO Committee on 
Agriculture meeting during the week of July 4. 
 
¶2.  According to MIFIC, Castillo expressed Nicaragua's 
support for the negotiating draft proposed by Mongolia, which 
would avoid restructuring the current system of food aid and 
includes effective disciplines to prevent displacement of 
commercial sales.  In this context, he indicated that 
Nicaragua supports the continuation of the modality of 
receiving food aid in kind, as is provided in the Food Aid 
Convention of the FAO, as well as in cash.
