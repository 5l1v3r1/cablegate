¶1. (U) On July 26, POLOFF met with Orlando Gomez, Director 
General of the America's Division at the Ministry of Foreign 
Relations (MINREX) to deliver points as directed in REFTELs. 
Gomez responded that while the Foreign Minister had recently 
raised the issue of whether to attend UNGA with President 
Ortega, no decisions had yet been made.  Gomez added that 
earlier this week, FM Santos had meet with UNSYG Ban Ki-moon 
in New York and had presented Ban with a proposal regarding 
how to reform development assistance.  Gomez noted that 
Nicaragua had been in touch with Spain and Brazil about the 
possibility of a thematically-related event attended by 
President Ortega, Brazilian President Lula and the Spanish 
PM.  Gomez said his office would provide additional details 
about the GON delegation as they became available. 
 
¶2. (U) COMMENT (for IO/T and S/CPR):  Post notes that while 
the GON has apparently only engaged in preliminary internal 
discussion about a delegation to UNGA, if President Ortega 
were to attend, First Lady Rosario Murillo would almost 
certainly accompany him, though she would be unlikely to have 
a schedule separate from that of the President.
