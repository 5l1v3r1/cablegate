SUBJECT: CAMINO CRISTIANO LEADER DIGS IN HEELS OVER PLC 
 
REF: MANAGUA 0709 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Camino Cristiano (CCN) leader/National Assembly 
Deputy, Reverend Guillermo Osorno, appears likely to 
formalize an alliance with the Liberal Constitutional Party 
(PLC).  In his April 27 meeting with Ambassador to discuss 
the feasibility of multi-party primaries (Reftel), Osorno 
opined that it is too late in the game for primaries, but 
perhaps negotiations remain an option.  He related that the 
CCN had recently signed a letter of intent to ally with the 
PLC, but the agreement is not yet formal and his party still 
has time to change its mind. 
 
¶2.  (C) Osorno claimed that he is no fan of PLC leader 
Arnoldo Aleman and his inner circle and doubts their 
sincerity that they have promised to run a clean government. 
However, he argued that only the PLC, with its experience, 
party machinery, and vast infrastructure can beat FSLN 
presidential candidate Daniel Ortega.  Moreover, the PLC 
enjoys representation on the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) 
and thus can defend its votes, while the other democratic 
parties, like the CCN, APRE, and Eduardo Montealegre's ALN, 
are "helpless." 
 
¶3.  (C) Osorno suggested that the Embassy could strike a deal 
with the PLC that would lead to Aleman's eventual loss of 
control of the party.  In his view, our latest visa 
revocation of a PLC member (National Assembly Deputy Donald 
Lacayo, who heads the Assembly's Ethics Committee) is working 
against U.S. interests because the PLC is now less likely to 
cooperate on legislative issues.  The Ambassador replied that 
we have endeavored for years to distance Aleman from the PLC 
and he has been intransigent, as has his inner circle.  He 
warned Osorno that allying with Aleman is a mistake and 
suggested that Osorno would be better off supporting a 
democratic alternative. 
 
¶4.  (C) Comment: President Bolanos tells us the Osorno is one 
the "most expensive" National Assembly votes, expecting that 
in return for his vote on a particular issue, three or four 
of his relatives will land government jobs.  Osorno's party 
is in large part a family operation (the three Camino 
Cristiano members who accompanied him for the meeting with 
the Ambassador are all his relatives.)  The other Camino 
Cristiano Assembly Deputy, Delia Arellano, has openly sided 
with Eduardo Montealegre and votes with his ALN-PC bloc.  If 
the Camino Cristiano allies with Aleman, such an alignment 
might not represent much of a loss for Montealegre, as 
Osorno's (whose nickname is "soborno," or "bribe") reputation 
is clearly not an asset for a candidate running on a clean 
government platform.   End Comment.
