REF: A. SECSTATE 198999 
     ¶B. MANAGUA 0355 
 
¶1. (U) At the earliest opportunity after the inauguration of 
the new president and the seating of a new cabinet, the 
Ambassador met the new Minister of Trade, Industry and 
Development Horacio Brenes Icabalceta about attending the 
Americas Competitiveness Forum in Atlanta on June 11-13 (refs 
A and B).  In follow-up to this meeting, the Ambassador 
supplied additional information to Minister Brenes about the 
forum and asked for his suggestions as to who might attend 
from his government.  Econoff also contacted his staff, but 
have not yet received a response. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We believe the situation is complicated by the fact 
that the Ministry of Finance has requested that all 
ministries and government agencies pass budgeted funding for 
travel and public relations to a central account to be 
managed by the Presidency, specifically the person of the 
Coordinator for Public Communications and Citizenship, First 
Lady Rosario Murillo.  These funds appear destined for 
Peoples, Councils, an experiment in direct democracy. 
Brenes, office has inquired as to whether funding to attend 
the conference from the USG.  We are examining whether post 
funds might be available. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post apologizes for taking longer than the time 
allotted, and would like to suggest that invitations be sent
