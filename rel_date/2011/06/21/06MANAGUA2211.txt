SUBJECT: NICARAGUA OPPOSES NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR TEST, 
OFFERS TO WEIGH IN VIA ITS AMBASSADOR IN TOKYO 
 
REF: STATE 166404 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (U) This cable responds to reftel and contains an action 
request in para 2. 
 
¶2.  (C) On October 5, Ambassador delivered reftel points to 
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Norman Caldera, suggesting that 
the fact the Nicaraguan government (GON) maintains diplomatic 
relations with North Korea could be helpful.  The Foreign 
Minister replied that the GON shares our concerns regarding 
North Korea's plans to conduct a nuclear test and its efforts 
to become a nuclear power.  He offered to seek the assistance 
of the Nicaraguan Ambassador to Japan, Harry Bodan, who also 
covers North Korea, to engage the North Koreans on the issue. 
 We solicit the Department's view of whether such an approach 
could be helpful.  Caldera suggested that U.S. Embassy Tokyo 
also approach Bodan, who serves as the dean of the diplomatic 
corps and is a long-time Asia hand, to follow up on the 
matter.  Caldera explained that Nicaragua desires to take the 
lead in Central America on relations with Asia.  Further, 
given the fact that Japan and Taiwan are major donors to 
Nicaragua, their concerns over North Korea's nuclear 
intentions are particularly relevant to Nicaraguan interests. 
 Finally, GON will support its ally the United States on this 
initiative.
