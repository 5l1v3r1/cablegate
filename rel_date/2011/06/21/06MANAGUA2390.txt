SUBJECT: NICARAGUA WILL NOT BACK NAM'S UNGA RESOLUTIONS ON 
THE SITUATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND CHILDREN IN LEBANON 
 
REF: STATE 176793 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
(C)  In response to reftel demarche, acting Foreign Affairs 
Minister Javier Williams Slate assured DCM on October 25 that 
the Nicaraguan government (GON) will not support biased, 
one-sided positions concerning alleged human rights abuses 
arising from the recent conflict between Israel and Lebanon. 
While noting that Foreign Minister Caldera had been 
dissappointed by Israel's lack of support for Nicaragua's 
candidacy for a non permanent UN Security Council seat last 
fall, backing Peru instead, Williams Slate asserted that 
Caldera has recovered from the disappointment.  He noted that 
during the new Israeli ambassador's recent presentation of 
his credentials, President Bolanos assured him that Nicaragua 
will support Israel in international fora.
