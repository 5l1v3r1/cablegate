Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey for reason 1.4 (b).

¶1. KEY POINTS

-- (C) In a May 20 meeting with Interior Minister Habib
Al-Adly, the Ambassador raised identity documents for
Baha'is, and urged the release of a Coptic priest jailed for
performing the wedding of a Christian convert who allegedly
held forged identity documents.

-- (C) The Ambassador urged clemency for three jailed
bloggers, and asked for MOI agreement to register three U.S.
NGOs.  She requested MOI agreement to continuing USG-funded
police training, and GOE assistance locating 15-year old
Amcit Sara El-Gohary.

-- (C) Minister Adly said that blogger Musad Abu Fagr
supported criminal activities regarding Palestinians entering
Egypt.  He criticized the U.S. NGOs for operating without
registration and for allegedly supporting the political
opposition.  Adly pledged to look into the other issues
raised.

-----------------------
Religious Freedom Cases
-----------------------

¶2. (C) The Ambassador thanked the Minister for the MOI's May
20 issuance of birth certificates to Baha'is with a dash in
the religion field.  She asked for the issuance of identity
cards for Baha'is with a dash in the religion field (ref B).
Ambassador raised the case of   Coptic priest ,
convicted and sentenced to a five-year prison term in October
2008 for performing the wedding of a Christian convert from
Islam who allegedly used a forged identity card to establish
her Christian identity (ref E).  Ambassador asked whether the
GOE could release Coptic priest on bail while he files an
appeal.  Adly said he would look into the case.

---------------------
Clemency for Bloggers
---------------------

¶3. (C) The Ambassador urged clemency for three bloggers
currently in jail:  Karim Amer, convicted and sentenced to a
four-year prison term in December 2007 for insulting Islam
and President Mubarak; Musad Abu Fagr, jailed in 2007
following his blog posts about the difficulties of the Sinai
Bedouin; and Hany Nazir, jailed in October 2008 following
blogging about issues sensitive to Islam and Christianity
(ref C).  The Minister responded that Abu Fagr supported
criminal activities related to Palestinians entering Egypt.
The Ambassador urged that their detentions be reviewed since
there did not appear to be any prosecution underway.

---------------------
Registering U.S. NGOs
---------------------

¶4. (C) The Ambassador urged the Minister to agree to register
three U.S. NGOs operating in Egypt:  the National Democratic
Institute, the International Republican Institute, and the
International Federation for Electoral Systems.  She noted
that registration of these NGOs would be favorably received
in Washington.  Minister Adly replied that these
organizations began working in Egypt before they were
registered, and have supported the political opposition.  He
added that although the GOE issues these NGOs visas, "this
doesn't mean they can be legally registered."  The Ambassador
pushed back, saying that these NGOs are very respectful of
local law, and have worked closely with GOE entities such as
the Supreme Election Commission.

------------------------------------
Police Training and Counterterrorism
------------------------------------

¶5. (C) The Ambassador requested MOI agreement to continuing
USG-funded police training, and noted that the embassy had
submitted a diplomatic note to the MFA on the subject (ref
A).  Adly said he would look into the issue.  The Ambassador
asked about press reports of the May 15 arrests of Muslim
Brotherhood (MB) officials for money laundering.  Adly said
the MB has received foreign funds.  He noted that the GOE
would announce on May 22 the arrests of additional
individuals involved in the February 22 Khan Al-Khalili
bombing in Cairo (ref D).  Adly said the group had received
funds from France.

-------------------------------------------
Consular Case and Diplomatic License Plates
-------------------------------------------

¶6. (C) The Ambassador requested MOI assistance to locate 15
year-old Amcit Sara El-Gohary, abducted by her father in
Egypt in 1997, so her mother can see her.  She noted that
U.S. television is now focused on the story.  The mother is
no longer seeking to have custody -- she simply wants to see
her child.  Adly said the MOI "will do our best."  The
Ambassador asked for MOI assistance in providing new
diplomatic license plates for embassy employees at a location
near the embassy.  Adly said he would try to facilitate such
an arrangement.
