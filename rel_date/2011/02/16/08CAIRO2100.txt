RETRANSFER, END-USE AND SECURITY OBLIGATIONS 
 
REF: STATE 99685 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey for reason 1.4 (b) and (d)
1.(S) On September 25, Ambassador delivered reftel demarche to Minister of Defense Field Marshal Tantawi on a possible end-use violation involving a Chinese company's proposal to supply test kits for US produced AN/ALQ-131 jamming pods and radar warning receivers. Tantawi said the reports were "not true," assuring Ambassador that Egypt would not share any information on American equipment or technology with other countries. He noted that the Egyptian Air Force periodically cooperated with other countries concerning upgrades of non-American equipment, like Russian MiGs and French Mirage fighter planes, but would never share information on American equipment.

Â¶2. (S) Tantawi expressed hope that Bright Star would remain a robust exercise. Ambassador agreed on the strategic importance of regional cooperation, but noted that manpower and financial constraints necessitated a smaller scale Bright Star. She encouraged Tantawi to share his ideas for the September 2009 Bright Star with incoming CENTCOM Commander General Petraeus during his first visit to the region later this year, adding she was confident a new vision for Bright Star could be created that would meet both countries' strategic needs and resource challenges.
