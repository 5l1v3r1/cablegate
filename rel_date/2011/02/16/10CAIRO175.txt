REF: 10 CAIRO 131 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Donald A. Blome, Minister Counselor, Embassy Cairo, ECPO; REASON: 1.4(B), (D)

1.(C) Key points: - The Egyptian MFA remains concerned about the situation in Yemen, especially Sanaa's approach to resolving the situation in the south. A key MFA advisor expressed his belief Feb 8 that Iran is providing large amounts of weapons to the Houthi rebels. - The Egyptians have stressed that Yemen is of significant strategic interest to the Egyptians, as evidenced by FM Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Soliman's January visit to Sanaa and Egypt's participation at the Feb 13 London meeting. The Egyptians will participate in the Feb 27 meeting to be hosted by the Saudis in Riyadh.

2.(C) MFA Cabiet Advisor for Arab Affairs Mahmoud Afifi told poloff Feb 8 that the Egyptians were generally satisfied with the discussion at the Jan 13 London meeting on Yemen. Afifi reiterated Egyptian concern that the British had approached the Yemen situation with a heavy focus on GCC countries, at the expense of other Arab states such as Egypt and Jordan. He also noted that Arab League SYG Moussa had not been invited to the London meeting, something that had mystified the Egyptians. Afifi said the Egyptians are taking the situation in Yemen very seriously, as evidenced by FM Aboul Gheit and EGIS Chief Soliman's early January visit to Sanaa for the purpose of supporting the Yemeni government. He said the Egyptians would attend the Feb 27 meeting in Riyadh, which he understood would include the GCC member states, Jordan, Egypt and key western donors (including the U.S.) Afifi said the Saudis had not determined the level of participation, but he expected it would be a sub-ministerial, and if that were the case MFA Chief of Cabinet Wafa Bassim would most likely lead the Egyptian delegation.

3.(C) Afifi said the Egyptians are concerned that the Houthis continue to hold significant leverage over Sanaa. He said the Yemenis had told Aboul Gheit and Soliman in early January of their plan to engage in dialogue with the Houthis "gradually," and to use local tribes as intermediaries, but Afifi said he expected Sanaa to complete its military operations first. He believed the Houthis would accept some of Sanaa's six conditions for a ceasefire, but did not expect they would agree to full surrender of their weapons. "It is not a secret that Iran is supplying the Houthis with large amounts of arms," Afifi asserted.

4.(C) Afifi was more concerned about the situation in the south, which he said remains "Egypt's main worry." He said the Egyptians have urged Sanaa to meet the "legitimate demands" of the southerners, especially on economic issues. Sanaa is incorrectly focusing on "containing" the south. Social discrimination remains a problem. He said the Egyptians have told Sanaa that the situation will take a long time to resolve, but that promises must be made by the government to resolve longstanding political and economic issues with the south.

5.(C) Afifi said the Egyptians are relatively confident Sanaa will successfully confront the Al Qaeda problem in Yemen, but the GOE expects a tough fight. He believed the recent "pre-emptive strikes" by the Saudis and Yemenis had been effective. SCOBEY
