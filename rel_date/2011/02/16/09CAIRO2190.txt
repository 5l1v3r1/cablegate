1.(SBU) As per ref A, A/RSO-I is providing the following adverse information for the asylum requests of Saleh, Samouel Ishak Koryakos (D/POB: 13-Sep-1986, Menia, Egypt),Botros, Antonious Thrwat Shouky (D/POB: 11-Sep-1986, Menia, Egypt),Dief, Kerolos Adly Roshdy (D/POB: 01-Jan-1991, Menia, Egypt). These individuals were part of a large fraud scheme of young Coptic Christian men being smuggled into the United States to allegedly sing at a church in Chicago (see ref B). These individuals successfully misrepresented themselves and all were issued visas. However, a subsequent attempt by a second group was thwarted and all were denied visas.

2.(SBU) The A-RSO/I and Fraud Prevention Manager (FPM) interviewed the four individuals of this second group. Each individual admitted that they paid about USD 12,000 to a local travel office for the fake documentation. In addition, they all confirmed that their primary motive to leave Egypt and go to the United States was economic and not a fear of persecution because they were Christian. They stressed that there are few economic opportunities for them in Egypt and that the United States could provide them with a better future.

3.(SBU) The A/RSO-I and FPM are currently investigating similar fraud schemes to smuggle young Coptic men to the United States and will report via septel as more information is gathered. SCOBEY
