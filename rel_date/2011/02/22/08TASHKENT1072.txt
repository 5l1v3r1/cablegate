SUBJECT: UZBEKISTAN: GULNORA KARIMOVA'S GENEVA U.N. \
APPOINTMENT MAY REFLECT CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE \
 \
Classified By: Poloff Steven Prohaska for reasons 1.4 (b, d). \
 \
¶1. (C) Embassy contacts and press reporting have recently \
indicated that President Karimov's oldest daughter, Gulnora \
Karimova, has been appointed as Uzbekistan's permanent \
representative to the United Nations Mission in Geneva, \
though the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Americas Desk had not \
confirmed this information to us as of September 18. \
Karimova has served as Deputy Foreign Minister for \
International Cooperation in the Cultural and Humanitarian \
Spheres in recent months.  On September 9, XXXXXXXXXXXX confirmed to Ambassador Norland that \
Gulnora and her two children recently received visas allowing \
them to move to Geneva, where she will assume duties as \
permrep at Uzbekistan's UN Mission.  XXXXXXXXXXXX \
indicated that the request for the visas had come through \
very suddenly and with pressure for a fast turnaround.  XXXXXXXXXXXX \
did not know whether Gulnora had yet departed Uzbekistan. \
The private teacher of Gulnora's son told Poloff on September \
9, however, that he and his wife had just returned from \
London for the new academic year, but had yet to start \
teaching because both Gulnora and her son were in \
Switzerland.  The teacher was uncertain whether he would \
remain in Tashkent or would be asked to join them in \
Switzerland. \

 \
¶2. (C) Karimova's new position as Uzbek permrep to the UN in \
Geneva puts her much closer to the Switzerland-based Zeromax \
corporation, which provides much of the Karimov family's \
wealth, but probably does little to enhance her political \
standing at home.  Despite speculation over the years that \
President Karimov may be grooming Gulnora to succeed him, the \
decision to send Karimova to Geneva may reflect a desire to \
secure the family's finances and enhance its prospects for \
future safety and security if conditions in Uzbekistan turn \
against the Karimov family, rather than to provide her with \
another stepping stone in her political career.  Karimova has \
given little indication of her long-term political plans, but \
the Karimov family has made many enemies; the fear and \
loathing that many alienated businessmen in Uzbekistan have \
for her suggests that her life in a post-Karimov Uzbekistan \
would be less than secure.  It is interesting to note now \
that both Karimov daughters hold diplomatic postings outside \
of Uzbekistan--Gulnora in Geneva, and Lola at UNESCO in Paris. \
