SUBJECT: SWITZERLAND & LIECHTENSTEIN: ASSESSING OUR \
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS \
 \
FROM AMBASSADOR PAMELA P. WILLEFORD \
 \
1.(U) Introduction:  As I prepare to leave Embassy Bern \
after two and a half years, I would like to share some \
observations and insights I gained during my tenure here.  I \
hope these thoughts will be helpful to those dealing with \
Switzerland and Liechtenstein, and Europe in general. \
 \
----------- \
Big Picture \
----------- \
 \
2.(SBU) Switzerland and Liechtenstein are niche players in \
the world and we must be creative in how we challenge them \
to contribute to our shared goals.  Our three new agreements \
with Switzerland -- covering political cooperation, trade \
and investment, and counterterrorism cooperation -- are \
modest achievements in and of themselves, but must be filled \
with good content to be truly useful.  We should not be \
afraid to ask our partners for assistance, mindful that \
there are constraints on how active these traditionally \
neutral countries can be.  In anything we do, personal \
relationships will be key.  We should not be fooled that the \
engineer-like Swiss are impervious to relationships - this \
is how we get things done.  We encourage Washington to \
cultivate and use these relationships, just as we have done \
in Bern. \
 \
3.(SBU) A word on Davos.  The World Economic Forum's Annual \
Meeting is the premier event of its kind.  The USG can use \
this platform to spread our message.  Indeed, if we are \
early enough with our ideas, we can work with WEF organizers \
to fashion sessions and programs important to us.  A high- \
level USG presence is noticed by the global community.  We \
encourage Washington to begin thinking now about this coming \
January's meeting. \
 \
------------------------- \
State of the Partnerships \
------------------------- \
 \
4.(SBU) Switzerland and Liechtenstein can be valuable \
partners for the United States, provided we are creative in \
identifying areas of cooperation that take into account \
their own limitations.  Though neither is a member of the EU \
or NATO, each play a role larger than their size would \
suggest.  Switzerland and Liechtenstein, as international \
financial centers, are important to the struggle against \
terrorist finance, money laundering, and narcotics assets. \
Economically, Switzerland is the world's 16th largest \
economy, 12th largest aid donor, 6th largest direct investor \
in the United States, and "manager" of 40 percent of the \
world's privately held savings.  Switzerland is a \
participant in all relevant export control and non- \
proliferation regimes.  In political affairs, Switzerland \
plays above its size in the United Nations.  It has used its \
neutral status to our benefit along the Korean DMZ and as \
our protecting power in Iran and Cuba.  As depository of the \
Geneva Conventions, Switzerland has recently played a key \
role in hosting a diplomatic conference passing the Third \
Additional Protocol to the Third Geneva Convention. \
Switzerland's tentative steps toward peacekeeping in the \
Balkans, engagement in NATO's Partnership for Peace, and \
even tiny presence with ISAF in Afghanistan, reflects a \
country reconsidering its role in global security - though \
with trepidation. \
 \
5.(SBU) Our greatest challenge has been prying more \
cooperation out of the often provincial and isolationist \
sectors of the societies.  Bank secrecy laws entail that \
host country financial institutions are substantially self- \
policing - not an entirely comforting situation. \
Agricultural protectionism shattered Swiss efforts to pursue \
a free trade agreement with the United States.  Both the \
federal structure of Switzerland and acute concerns about \
sovereignty mean that information sharing on terrorism, \
proliferation, and other crimes is less than optimal.  The \
 \
Swiss military is barred from participation in peace \
enforcement (as opposed to peacekeeping) activities.  Media \
has been critical of the war in Iraq and the broader war on \
terrorism - particularly with respect to Guantanamo, \
renditions, and travel/visa restrictions.  Bad feelings \
derived from the Holocaust Assets scandal still redounds \
against us. \
 \
6.(SBU) Facing these challenges, Embassy Bern has worked \
with sympathetic counterparts within the host governments to \
fashion ways of improving coordination and avoiding \
friction.  Among the measures we have taken are several \
agreements designed to ease cooperation on political \
affairs, trade, and law enforcement.  The Federal Council \
approved three this week, and should address the customs \
agreement this summer: \
 \
-- Framework for Intensified Cooperation, to ease \
collaboration on multilateral democracy and security \
building.  Thus far, this has reaped Swiss membership in, \
and million dollar donation to, the Foundation for the \
Future, as well as Swiss financial support for disarmament \
in Ukraine, election monitoring in Afghanistan, and the \
NATO/EAPC trust fund in Iraq. \
 \
-- Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum (the Forum) for \
discussion and resolution of minor trade and investment \
disputes and discussion of common efforts to, for example, \
strengthen intellectual property rights.  The Forum will \
complement other non-trade related economic discussions \
under the auspices of the Joint Economic Commission \
established in 2002. \
 \
-- Operative Working Arrangement (OWA) to enable information \
sharing and possible joint investigations in terrorism \
cases. \
 \
-- Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement (CMAA), addressing \
offenses against customs laws that are prejudicial to the \
economic, fiscal, and commercial interests of both \
countries, due for finalization this summer. \
 \
7.(U) In addition to these agreements, the Embassy worked \
successfully with OBO and local Swiss officials to finalize \
a lease on a new chancery, which we should occupy in 2008. \
 \
----------------------------------- \
Regional Stability, Democracy & Aid \
----------------------------------- \
 \
8.(SBU) Switzerland's traditional neutrality has, in the \
past, severely restricted its involvement in world affairs \
outside of the humanitarian and economic spheres.  We have \
worked hard to bring the Swiss around toward fostering \
regional stability and democracy.  In May 2005, the Federal \
Council (cabinet) voted to enhance our bilateral \
relationship.  As a first gesture, they contributed $250 \
thousand to the NATO/PfP trust fund for Iraq, $350 thousand \
to dismantling conventional weapons in Ukraine, $300 \
thousand for election observation in Afghanistan (among the \
largest OSCE donations), and added short-term training \
courses for Iraqi and Afghan security officials.  The Swiss \
also made a significant commitment to fostering democracy in \
the broader Middle East and North Africa by joining the \
Forum for the Future and pledging $1 million to the \
Foundation for the Future. \
 \
9.(U) Progress on the diplomatic front was also impressive, \
as the Swiss fulfilled their obligation as depository state \
for the Geneva Conventions by hosting a diplomatic \
conference to approve the Third Additional Protocol, which \
in turn will allow the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement to \
recognize the Israeli Star-of-David emblem.  Embassy (with \
Mission Geneva) invested a great deal of effort in steeling \
the spines of our Swiss counterparts, efforts crucial to \
ensuring a successful diplomatic conference. \
 \
10.(SBU) For the future, we want the Swiss to maintain their \
220-strong peacekeeping force deployed to Kosovo and Bosnia, \
to expand their small presence in Afghanistan, and to \
broaden their NATO-partnership activities outside of Europe. \
We want Swiss Army reform currently underway to succeed in \
transforming the Swiss military into a lighter, deployment- \
oriented force available for peace support operations.  We \
also wish to maintain our defense procurement relationship \
with the Swiss military.  We also hope to see the Swiss \
enlarge their broader security assistance to include police \
and border security assistance.  Likewise, in the aftermath \
of the Kashmir earthquake and Indian Ocean Tsunami, we might \
encourage the Swiss to explore a potential PfP coordinating \
role for the use of military assets in humanitarian relief - \
an area that might appeal to the pacifist as well as \
internationalist sectors of the populace. \
 \
-------------------- \
Trade & Investment \
------------------ \
 \
11.(U) A major outcome of the May 2005 Federal Council \
decision was the Swiss proposal to explore a free trade \
agreement with the United States.  Unfortunately, needed \
agricultural tariff reforms were too large a pill for many \
Swiss to swallow.  USTR's fallback position was to initiate \
a bilateral Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum, mandated \
to address small, yet sensitive issues such as strengthening \
intellectual property rights cooperation, removing Non- \
Tariff Barriers to trade and investment, and beef and wine \
exports. \
 \
12.(U) Another potentially useful tool for the Mission is \
the U.S.-Swiss Joint Economic Commission (JEC), whose \
meetings in Washington, Bern, and at the World Economic \
Forum in Davos have served as fora for discussion and \
resolution of bilateral misunderstandings.  Through the JEC, \
the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, and intensive \
outreach efforts with Swiss and Liechtenstein media, the \
Mission has alleviated business concern about U.S. post-9/11 \
security measures such as passenger name recognition laws, \
food security, aviation cargo regulations, and the financial \
provisions of the Patriot Act.  Working proactively, we \
averted a potential crisis on Zurich Airport's FAA \
certification.  FCS's intervention also turned back Swiss \
Health Office attempts to disadvantage U.S. pharmaceuticals. \
 \
-------------------- \
World Economic Forum \
-------------------- \
 \
13.(U) The WEF Annual Meeting in January is the premier \
international event of its kind.  Our Embassy's presence \
supports senior cabinet and congressional participation (six \
cabinet members and seven legislators last year; presidents \
and vice presidents in recent years).  Our consultations \
with WEF organizers ensure that USG officials have a \
platform to our present policies.  This year, for the first \
time, the Mission established a "Shared Logistics Platform" \
that provided airport and security liaison assistance, as \
well as logistical support in the run-up to and during the \
WEF on a cost-sharing basis.  Washington remains an \
important partner for the Mission in WEF support, as we seek \
to regularize this practice and improve support for high- \
level USG WEF attendees. \
 \
---------------------------------- \
Counterterrorism & Law Enforcement \
---------------------------------- \
 \
14.(U) The FBI, Homeland Security, and the Drug Enforcement \
Administration are all represented at post, while other law \
enforcement agencies are represented by regional offices. \
We are working with Washington and the Swiss Government to \
grant the RSO law enforcement status as well. \
 \
15.(SBU) Cooperation with Swiss law enforcement agencies has \
 \
improved "glacially" over recent years.  We are hoping some \
changes will speed this process along.  We have recently \
agreed on new language for an updated bilateral Operative \
Working Agreement (OWA) allowing joint investigations under \
certain narrow circumstances.  Swiss Justice Minister \
Blocher will now present to Parliament.  Direct cooperation \
with cantonal and municipal police is severely restricted. \
We are also hopeful that a new OWA will lead to greater \
information sharing between the Swiss and Embassy law \
enforcement representatives, including at the cantonal \
level. \
 \
16.(SBU) Given the absence of direct attacks in their \
territory, public complacency is a big problem.  The level \
of risk is impossible to establish, absent the ability to \
investigate leads.  High-profile terrorist suspects arrested \
here - primarily support-personnel for the Madrid and Riyadh \
bombings - have been provisionally freed for lack of hard \
evidence.  One Salafist terrorist was deported to Spain, \
though only after a leak to the Spanish media revealed his \
presence in the country. \
 \
17.(SBU) On terrorist finance, the Swiss continue to freeze \
over $25 million in al Qaeda/Taliban assets.  Switzerland \
holds about $130 million in Iraqi assets, whose turnover has \
been delayed by UN bureaucracy.  Liechtenstein, for its \
part, is cooperating on the U.N. lists and is looking for \
ways to be helpful in USG efforts against North Korean \
assets.  We will continue to press both countries to ensure \
that financial institutions exercise due diligence with \
their clients and for authorities vigorously to investigate \
suspicious transaction reports. \
 \
18.(SBU) Liechtenstein was a model of cooperation for the \
mission's law enforcement agencies, offering legal \
assistance on important investigations of money laundering \
and child pornography.  The principality continues to be in \
full compliance with the Financial Action Task Force \
requirements.  It recently returned a high-profile Iraqi \
asset, Saddam's former executive jet, to the new government \
there.  Post ensured that media was aware of all these \
successes. \
 \
19.(SBU) One area where we have been effective in \
encouraging better coordination is in combating trafficking \
in persons (TIP).  USG pressure, especially the downgrading \
of Switzerland in 2004 to "tier two," has spurred the Swiss \
Federal Government to communicate better with cantons on \
ways to protect trafficking victims and to identify areas of \
prosecution.  As the Swiss move to introduce new legislation \
and enlarge data collection, we will look for ways to \
encourage and support them. \
 \
--------------------------------------------- --------- \
Non-proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction \
--------------------------------------------- --- \
 \
20.(SBU) The Swiss are members of all relevant non- \
proliferation agreements and regimes and reliably report \
requests for controlled items.  Traditionally, in the gray \
area of dual-use items, the Swiss have been less diligent. \
However, we have recently witnessed a greater openness on \
the part of export control officials to share information, \
due in large measure to Embassy outreach and Washington's \
agreement to supply leads on investigations.  Given the \
growing threat from Iran and North Korea, this is very \
important.  Swiss officials have taken part in PSI exercises \
and are on-board for using existing law robustly against \
proliferators.  The Mission hopes that a broadened OWA will \
also foster joint investigations in the area of non- \
proliferation connected with terrorism. \
 \
21.(SBU) The Swiss co-hosted with the USG two major \
conferences on WMD - one a workshop for 80 representatives \
of Eurasian countries on the bio-terrorism threat and \
another with 60 participants on supporting a US Department \
of Energy effort to eliminate plutonium-producing plants in \
 \
Russia.  Pledges on the latter project have been \
forthcoming.  Follow-on conferences on both themes are \
expected in the coming 12 months.  In addition, under \
Partnership for Peace, the Swiss sponsor annual \
international conferences on critical infrastructure \
protection - an effort for which we hope to recruit USG \
experts. \
 \
-------- \
Consular \
-------- \
 \
22.(U) This year, our Consular Section has taken on \
additional burdens in assisting neighboring consular \
districts in Italy and France, where governments have failed \
to adopt machine-readable passports by the USG's deadline. \
These efforts are in addition to the usual portfolio, which \
also includes close coordination with the Swiss Protecting \
Power in Tehran.  Notwithstanding these challenges, Consular \
has achieved remarkable success in reducing visa applicant \
waiting times and improving customer service.  Washington \
was helpful in providing us with a needed fourth consular \
officer. \
 \
23.(U) The Embassy also increased public outreach to clarify \
visa and passport regulations and procedures and provide a \
human face to the application process.  Our Homeland \
Security, Foreign Commercial Service, Consular, and Public \
Affairs sections initiated and implemented a program of \
travel trade promotions and outreach to the press and the \
Swiss travel industry that has contributed to a significant \
improvement in the Swiss public perception of travel to the \
U.S.  Other factors contributing to the improved perception \
are the implementation of a Swiss pilot program for \
biometric passports and a growing public appreciation for \
security measures.  Positive public perception combined with \
favorable economic factors made the U.S. the leading long- \
haul destination for Swiss travelers.  The annual number of \
Swiss travelers to the U.S. increased from 235 thousand in \
2003 to 270 thousand in 2005, with an annual 300 thousand \
expected by 2007. \
 \
24.(U) Swiss students studying in the U.S. contribute \
approximately USD 60 million to the U.S. economy on an \
annual basis.  To promote graduate studies in the U.S., the \
Commercial, Public Affairs and Consular sections joined \
forces to support the annual MBA Fair in Zurich.  In 2005, a \
total of 4,656 students enrolled in U.S. higher education \
programs, a 13 percent boost from the previous year. \
 \
------------------ \
Public Diplomacy \
---------------- \
 \
25.(U) On all the above substantive goals, official Swiss \
reluctance to engage more deeply with the United States \
stems largely from public suspicion of USG actions. \
Generally, the Swiss public is not energized about the \
terrorist threat; those who are tend to believe that \
association with America might only increase Switzerland's \
exposure.  Some Swiss do "get it," however.  Mission's task \
is to work with these partners to spread the message that \
terrorism threatens us all and that spreading freedom and \
prosperity to the region is a long-term means to tackle the \
threat.  The large majority who opposed the war in Iraq must \
be reminded that we share a common interest in a successful \
new Iraq.  Those media outlets that have exaggerated USG \
faults have had their over-reaching exposed.  We will seek \
ways to help those sympathetic to our goals get the word \
out. \
 \
------------- \
Post Security \
------------- \
 \
26.(SBU) As noted in the law enforcement section, it has \
been an uphill struggle to convince many Swiss authorities \
 \
of the gravity of the current threat.  For many years, the \
Canton of Bern refused our requests to operate a \
surveillance detection (SD) team.  We have succeeded in \
reversing their decision and we should have an SD program in \
place shortly.  As noted, we are working to have our \
diplomatic security agents recognized as law enforcement \
under our bilateral agreements.  The coming years will offer \
a particular challenge as we relocate the Embassy to a new \
chancery. \
 \
---------------------------------------- \
Management: Relocation to a New Chancery \
---------------------------------------- \
 \
27.(U) Among the most satisfying accomplishments of the past \
years has been the identification and securing of a new \
chancery.  In 2005, we signed a lease for a more secure and \
centrally located Chancery building and executed a contract \
to sell the existing building.  We are completing the permit \
process.  Renovation on the new site should begin mid-2006, \
and we should be prepared to relocate in early FY 2008. \
Until that time, tremendous efforts will still be necessary \
to overcome challenges, both expected and unexpected. \
Washington's continued support will be key. \
 \
---------- \
Final note \
---------- \
 \
28.(U) I would like to thank everyone in Washington and Bern \
for their wonderful support during my time here.  I have had \
the privilege of working with tremendously talented people \
who are dedicated to serving their country.  Representing my \
country as U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein \
has been one of the highlights of my life. \
