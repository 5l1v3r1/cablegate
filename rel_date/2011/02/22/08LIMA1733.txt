SUBJECT: PUCALLPA MAYOR ARRESTED ON DRUG TRAFFICKING CHARGES 

Classified By: Polcouns Alexis Ludwig. Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 

¶1. (C) Summary: Peruvian police arrested Pucallpa Mayor Luis 
Valdez October 14 on charges of laundering drug trafficking 
proceeds through an extensive network of commercial 
enterprises. Twice elected mayor, Valdez enjoys significant 
public sympathy in his hometown. Peruvian law enforcement 
officials consider Valdez's arrest as on par in importance 
with that of kingpin Fernando Zevallos in 2004, but serious 
challenges in bringing him to justice -- and in confronting 
other traffickers -- remain. End Summary. 

¶2. (SBU) Units of the Peruvian National Police Anti-drug 
Directorate (DIRANDRO) arrested Pucallpa Mayor Luis VALDEZ 
Villacorta and 13 others  October 14 on money laundering 
charges. Arrest warrants remained outstanding for another 8 
persons. Pucallpa is the capital of the jungle region of 
Ucayali in eastern Peru. Valdez owns a number of businesses 
in the region including a lumber mill, river ferry service, 
and brewery. Authorities began asset seizure proceedings for 
those operations, in addition to 34 properties in Lima, 
Iquitos and Pucallpa; 44 boats; and 200 vehicles. Police 
transported the suspects to Lima where they were to be held 
while authorities prepared a formal indictment. 

¶3. (SBU) The arrests were the result of an investigation that 
began in February 2008, based on drug seizures dating back to 
2003 in Guatemala, Panama and most recently in Holland. PNP 
officials subsequently determined that financial records of 
Valdez's enterprises showed at least USD 71 million in assets 
whose origin could not be substantiated. 

¶4. (C) Given that Valdez's companies employ some 3,000 people 
in Ucayali and his election twice as Pucallpa mayor, he 
enjoys strong support from the public. After his detention 
some 30-40 supporters blocked streets and the entrance to the 
airport, hoping to prevent the authorities from removing him 
to Lima. Analysts explained to poloff that Valdez and his 
organization controlled the flow of drugs out of Peru to the 
east and northeast, primarily into Brazil. The organization 
used its commercial network and logistical resources to 
facilitate the movement out of the country of large 
quantities of cocaine, say those observers. Even without good 
estimates of the quantity of drugs the Valdez network moved, 
one analyst told poloff that Valdez's arrest was the single 
biggest blow to drug trafficking interests in Peru since the 
2004 arrest of Peruvian drug kingpin Fernando Zevallos. 

¶5. (C) Comment: While the Valdez arrest is good news in 
Peru's fight against drug trafficking, many challenges 
remain. First is whether the Peruvian justice system can 
avoid external pressures and successfully prosecute the case 
to its conclusion. Historical examples of lengthy 
prosecutions such as the Zevallos or Sanchez Paredes cases 
would put that result in doubt. Second, observers explain 
there is at least one Luis Valdez equivalent for every major 
exit route in the country, and many others waiting to take 
their places. As one analyst told poloff, much of the traffic 
previously moved to the northeast by the Valdez organization 
already had been diverted to land routes to Brazil in the far 
eastern region of Madre de Dios, along portions of the 
Interoceanic Highway. Similar routes existed overland via 
Puno to Bolivia; and out of ports in Arequipa, Lima, and 
Piura to maritime distribution channels in the Pacific, they 
said.
