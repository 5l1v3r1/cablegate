CLASSIFIED BY: Gene A. Cretz, Ambassador, U.S. Embassy - \
Tripoli, U.S. Dept of State. \
REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) \
¶1. (C) Summary: A series of events since last summer suggest \
that tension between various children of Muammar al-Qadhafi has \
increased, and that heir-apparent Saif al-Islam is arrayed \
against Muatassim, Aisha, Hannibal, Saadi and perhaps even his \
own mother.  Much of the tension appears to stem from resentment \
of Saif al-Islam's high-profile as the public face of the \
regime; however, deeper tension about contradictions between \
Saif al-Islam's proposed political-economic reforms, which would \
hurt his siblings' economic interests, and the old school manner \
by which he has tried to monopolize the most lucrative economic \
sectors, also play an important role.  The arrest and \
intimidation of a number of Saif al-Islam allies since last \
summer, on the one hand, and moves to circumscribe Muatassim's \
role in military equipment procurement, on the other, suggest \
that the current level of discord among al-Qadhafi's children is \
acute.  While internecine strife is nothing new for the famously \
fractious al-Qadhafi family, the recent escalation of tension \
comes during a particularly momentous period.  Amid turmoil \
related to the 40th anniversary of the revolution, Muammar \
al-Qadhafi's recent election as African Union chairman, proposed \
political-economic reforms and persistent rumors about \
al-Qadhafi's health and the absence of a viable mechanism to \
orchestrate a succession, the sharp rivalry between the \
al-Qadhafi children could play an important, if not \
determinative role, in whether the family is able to hold on to \
power after the author of the revolution exits the political \
scene.  End summary. \
 \
GREED AND BAD BEHAVIOR ... \
 \
¶2. (C) As reported ref A, National Oil Corporation Chairman \
Shukhr Ghanem was approached by National Security Adviser \
Muatassim al-Qadhafi, son of Muammar al-Qadhafi, in late June \
2008 with a request for USD 1.2 billion, reportedly to establish \
a military/security unit akin to that of his younger brother, \
Khamis, and to make unspecified security upgrades.  In early \
July, Ghanem informed Muammar al-Qadhafi; however, he laughingly \
dismissed it.  According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, \
Ghanem subsequently submitted a letter of resignation in \
mid-August, believing that Muatassim or his confederates would \
seek revenge against Ghanem and/or his family for having denied \
the request for funds. (Note: XXXXXXXXXXXX  End note.) \
 \
¶3. (C) Ghanem's attempt to resign roughly coincided with two \
other disturbances of al-Qadhafi family comity: the arrest of \
Hannibal al-Qadhafi, a son of Muammar al-Qadhafi, in Geneva in \
mid-July (ref B subsequent) and a visit to Rome by Saadi \
al-Qadhafi, a son of Muammar al-Qadhafi, against his father's \
express wishes in early August.  Hannibal and Saadi both have \
checkered histories of unseemly behavior and public scuffles \
with authorities in Europe and elsewhere.  Although Muammar \
al-Qadhafi was reportedly fed a carefully vetted version of the \
events attendant to Hannibal's arrest to help minimize the \
perception that Hannibal was to blame, the elder al-Qadhafi was \
reportedly vexed that Libya, for reasons of protecting the first \
family's pride, had to engage in a bilateral spat with \
Switzerland at a time when it was trying to move ahead with \
negotiations for a framework agreement with the European Union. \
With respect to Saadi's trip, Muammar al-Qadhafi was reportedly \
livid that Libyan officials had permitted him to exit the \
country when it was known that he was not supposed to travel. \
Al-Qadhafi was particularly upset that Abdullah Sanussi, a \
former director of military intelligence and senior regime \
figure who had played a role as minder of the more troublesome \
al-Qadhafi offspring, had not done a better job of keeping track \
of Saadi. (Note: Sanussi is related by marriage to al-Qadhafi \
and is a trusted figure.  He is usually in physical proximity to \
the tent in which al-Qadhafi holds meetings with visiting \
foreign dignitaries and, according to members of al-Qadhafi's \
protocol office, personally oversees al-Qadhafis' close \
protection detail.  End note.) \
 \
... PROMPT AN AL-QADHAFI FAMILY MEETING \
 \
¶4. (C) The upshot of Muatassim's solicitation of funds, \
Hannibal's arrest and Saadi's jaunt was an al-Qadhafi family \
meeting in mid-August.  Al-Qadhafi reportedly decided to reduce \
Sanussi's role as a minder for the most troublesome children (he \
is still a key adviser to Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi) and to \
 \
TRIPOLI 00000208  002 OF 005 \
 \
 \
instead assign his daughter, Aisha al-Qadhafi, the task of \
monitoring the activities of ne'er-do-wells Saadi, Hannibal and \
Saif al-Arab.  (Note: The latter is the least publicly know of \
al-Qadhafi's children; he lives in Munich, where he pursues \
ill-defined business interests and spends much time partying. \
The German Ambassador has expressed concern to us that it is \
only a matter of time before there is an incident involving him. \
 End note.)  At the meeting, Saadi reportedly criticized his \
father for having ignored him, and specifically cited the fact \
that his (Saadi's) efforts to establish an Export Free Trade \
Zone near the western Libyan town of Zuwara had not enjoyed the \
kind of support that Muatassim's activities as National Security \
Adviser or Saif al-Islam's high-profile efforts under the \
Qadhafi Development Foundation and Libya Youth Forum.  As \
reported ref C, Muammar al-Qadhafi subsequently made an unusual \
visit to Zuwara last September and significant work on the \
development project began within a few days of his visit. \
Although the Zuwara Free Trade Zone is an ambitious and \
expensive project, Muammar al-Qadhafi likely views it as a \
relatively small price to pay if it helps occupy the notoriously \
ill-behaved Saadi and lends a patina of useful engagement to his \
otherwise less than sterling reputation. \
 \
¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX, have told us that Aisha played a strong role in \
urging a hardline Libyan position with respect to the \
Swiss-Libyan contretemps over Hannibal's arrest.  Separately, \
the Swiss Ambassador told us that Aisha's less than accurate \
rendering to her father of the events surrounding Hannibal's \
arrest and treatment by Swiss authorities helped stoke Muammar \
al-Qadhafi's anger, limiting the extent to which Libyan and \
Swiss officials could maneuver to find an acceptable compromise. \
  The Swiss have told us that in the most recent effort between \
the two sides to resolve the issue in Davos, Saif had approved \
an agreement that had the Swiss literally bending over backwards \
to assuage Libyan demands.  After making a phone call (to either \
Aisha or the leader), Saif returned somewhat chastened after \
several minutes to rescind the aproval.   The Swiss crisis, \
together with other points of intra-family tension, has \
reportedly brought Aisha, who enjoys closer relations with \
Hannibal than with her other brothers, together with Hannibal, \
Saadi and, to a lesser extent, Saif al-Arab.  Muatassim \
reportedly agreed with the hardline approach vis a vis the Swiss \
and has been closer to Aisha's end of the spectrum than to that \
of Saif al-Islam, who urged a more moderate approach.  Muhammad \
al-Qadhafi (the eldest son, but by al-Qadhafis' first wife) and \
Khamis al-Qadhafi (fifth son by al-Qadhafi's second wife and the \
well-respected commander of a special forces unit that \
effectively serves as a regime protection unit) have remained \
neutral.  Exacerbating family tensions is the fact that Saif \
al-Islam and his mother, Safia, have been on the outs since Saif \
al-Islam declined to accept as his bride the young woman his \
mother picked for him some two years ago.  Safia al-Qadhafi \
expressed frustration XXXXXXXXXXXX that Saif al-Islam had not only spurned her \
choice, but had persisted in his hard-partying, womanizing ways, \
a source of concern in a socially conservative country like \
Libya. \
 \
INCREASED TENSION BETWEEN SAIF AL-ISLAM AND MUATASSIM \
 \
¶6. (C) Against that backdrop of tension, competition between \
Saif al-Islam, whom most still regard as the heir-apparent, and \
Muatassim, whose viability as a potential alternative successor \
has risen since his appointment as National Security Adviser, \
has increased since last fall.  Several well-informed contacts \
with ties to family circles have reported that Saif al-Islam and \
Muatassim have not spoken in over three months.  Saif reportedly \
bridled at the fact that Muatassim accompanied Muammar \
al-Qadhafi on the latter's visit to Moscow, Minsk and Kiev last \
year (ref D), and played a key role in negotiating potential \
weapons contracts.  Muatassim (who flew back early) and his \
older brother Muhammad greeted Muammar al-Qadhafi at the airport \
upon the latter's return to Tripoli; Saif, who was in town, was \
pointedly absent.  The Serbian Ambassador, citing conversations \
with National Security Council staff and members of al-Qadhafi's \
entourage, recently told us that Muatassim had presented a \
number of proposed contracts for weapons, equipment and training \
to the Secretary of the Temporary Interim Defense Committee \
(MOD-equivalent), Abu Bakr Yunis shortly after his return from \
Moscow.  Yunis rejected them, arguing that the terms Muatassim \
had negotiated were not favorable and that Libya did not need \
 \
TRIPOLI 00000208  003 OF 005 \
 \
 \
much of the equipment Muatassim had proposed buying.  Muatassim \
interpreted Yunis's response as an attempt to freeze him out of \
military procurement affairs; there was a heated meeting late \
last December between Muatassim and Yunis, at which there was \
sharp disagreement about who had the lead on military \
procurement.  Muatassim reportedly argued that he alone should \
make such decisions.  According to the Serbian Ambassador's \
contacts, Muammar al-Qadhafi called a rump session of the \
Security Committee in December to mediate the conflict.  It was \
reportedly decided that while Muatassim would have the clear \
lead in non-military security equipment procurement, Yunis and \
the MOD-equivalent would continue to play a role in military \
procurement.  It was further determined that Khamis al-Qadhafi \
would play a larger role in military procurement, since his \
Khamis Regiment (the 32nd Brigade) had demonstrated some success \
in procurement.  Muatassim, whom the Serbian Ambassador \
described as "a bloody man" and "not terribly bright", \
reportedly believed that Saif al-Islam was behind some of the \
pushback against his having a clear lead on military \
procurement, worsening the tension between them. \
 \
¶7. (C) Saif al-Islam's highly-publicized visit to the U.S. last \
November-December exacerbated tension with his siblings, \
particularly Muatassim, who viewed it as grandstanding.  Saif \
al-Islam's high-profile role as the public face of the regime to \
the West has been a mixed blessing for him.  While it has \
bolstered his image (he is probably the most publicly-recognized \
figure in Libya other than Muammar al-Qadhafi), many Libyans \
view him as self-aggrandizing and too eager to please foreigners \
at the expense of Libyans' interest.  His role in the denouement \
of the Bulgarian nurses' case, in which he acknowledged in media \
interviews that the nurses had been tortured and the \
investigation into their alleged injection of the AIDS virus \
into Libyan children bungled, badly damaged his reputation.  The \
fact that his recent visit to the U.S. came not long after his \
August 2008 Youth Forum address - in which he strongly \
criticized the existing Jamahiriya system of governance, \
(disingenuously) said that most of his proposed reforms had \
already been achieved, and declared his intention to withdraw \
from political life to focus solely on civil society issues (ref \
E) - reportedly irritated his siblings.  Senior GOL contacts \
have suggested to us that Muatassim's desire to visit Washington \
this spring and his seemingly overweaning focus on having \
meetings with senior USG officials and signing a number of \
agreements are driven at least in part by a strong sense of \
competition with Saif al-Islam. \
 \
THE KNIVES COME OUT \
 \
¶8. (C) Recent events have fueled speculation that inter-sibling \
rivalries, and those of the more conservative regime elements \
they represent, have been increasing.  In what was viewed as a \
warning to Saif al-Islam against pressing his reform agenda too \
hard, regime critic Dhaw al-Mansuri was severely beaten on the \
street early last summer by men variously described as members \
of the Revolutionary Committees or security elements.  The \
Executive Director of the QDF-affiliated Human Rights Society of \
Libya, Muhammad Tarnesh, was detained in late April in \
connection with an editorial he had written criticizing the \
government's poorly coordinated campaign of housing and \
infrastructure development that featured as its primary \
accomplishment the seemingly random destruction of large numbers \
of residences and businesses.  Tarnesh told us the investigation \
was orchestrated by Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi, who \
had taken umbrage at the column and who has been engaged in a \
quiet struggle with Saif al-Islam over the latter's \
political-reform agenda. (Note: Al-Mahmoudi was appointed as a \
sop to conservative regime elements in 2006 after Shukhri \
Ghanem, former PM and a pro-reform protigi of Saif al-Islam, was \
sacked.  End note.)  More recently, the detention in early \
February of Juma'a Atiaga on charges that he was involved in a \
banned political organization and had a hand in the 1984 \
assassination of Libya's former Ambassador to Rome, Ammar Daw, \
has been widely interpreted by informed observers here as a run \
against Saif al-Islam by conservative regime elements (ref G). \
In interviews with al-Sharq al-Awsat at the time, Saif al-Islam \
decried the arrest as "ridiculous" and the QDF issued a \
statement calling for Atiaga's release and criticizing GOL \
authorities for having arrested Atiaga while ignoring other \
cases involving allegations of human rights abuses that the QDF \
had brought to the attention of authorities.  Reports suggest \
that National Security Adviser Muatassim al-Qadhafi orchestrated \
the arrest through the Prime Minister's office in retaliation \
for Saif al-Islam's recent encroachment on a business deal \
 \
TRIPOLI 00000208  004 OF 005 \
 \
 \
Muatassim was trying to broker. \
 \
¶9. (C) Perhaps most tellingly, Saif al-Islam's longtime business \
partner and financial adviser, Abdulrahman Karfakh, left Tripoli \
under duress in January, ostensibly to study English in \
Australia.  The shadowy Karfakh ran the National Engineering \
Supply and Services Company (NESSCO), a large holding company \
through which Saif al-Islam holds quiet partnerships in a number \
of foreign entities whose entry into the Libyan market he helped \
facilitate.  Established as an oil field services companies in \
the late 1990's, NESSCO now owns large stakes in over 20 major \
joint-venture projects and runs a profitable business in \
providing "facilitation" (usually visas and meetings with key \
GOL officials) for foreign companies seeking to enter the \
market.  Together with Saif al-Islam's quiet allotment of oil \
lifts from an offshore mooring point near the western Libyan \
area of al-Jurf, NESSCO represents his primary source of revenue \
and the principal means by which he finances his many \
activities.  As reported ref H, we were told last May that \
Muatassim appeared to be moving to play a larger role in \
commercial \
contracts with foreign companies, a bailiwick that had largely \
been reserved to that point for Saif al-Islam.  Karfakh was \
arrested last spring on corruption charges, supposedly at \
Muatassim's behest, and was only released after an impassioned \
plea by Saif al-Islam to his father.  Housing and Infrastructure \
Board Chairman Abuzeid Dorda told a contact of ours that Saif \
al-Islam had told Muammar al-Qadhafi that if he insisted on \
keeping Karfakh in prison, he might as well jail him (Saif \
al-Islam), too.  In the latest evolution, Muatassim's \
confederates approached Karfakh in late December/early January \
and warned him against interfering in Muatassim's business \
interests, threatening to kill him if he did not.  Saif al-Islam \
reportedly assessed that he could no longer guarantee Karfakh's \
safety or protect him from arrest, and arranged for him to \
quietly leave Tripoli for Australia for an indeterminate period \
to let things settle. \
 \
¶10. (C) The contretemps over Karfakh coincided with a sharp \
denial by Saif al-Islam of (incorrect) western media reports \
that he had paid USD one million to pop singer Mariah Carey for \
a four song set she sang at a New Year's Eve bash on the \
Caribbean island of St. Bart's.  Saif al-Islam was in the UAE \
and Thailand for New Year's.  Saif's "Oea" newspaper hotly \
denied that their boss had been the financier and corrections \
were printed in western media noting that Muatassim, not Saif \
al-Islam, was the organizer of the party in question. (Note: A \
well-informed contact, who helped bring Lionel Ritchie to Libya \
several years ago to sing at Aicha's al-Qadhafi's birthday \
party, recently confirmed that he had helped put Muatassim's \
people in touch with Carey's manager.  End note.) \
 \
¶11. (C) Comment: While internecine strife is nothing new for the \
famously fractious al-Qadhafi family, the recent escalation of \
tension between Saif al-Islam and Muatassim, Aisha, Hannibal and \
Saadi, comes during a particularly momentous period in the \
Jamahiriya's history.  The 40th anniversary of the revolution on \
September 1, 2009, together with Muammar al-Qadhafi's recent \
election as Chairman of the AU (ref H), proposed \
political-economic reforms, consideration of a constitution, and \
rumored elections, have contributed to a sense that Libya is in \
the midst of a period of particular political turbulence.  The \
Executive Director of the QDF recently told the DCM that a draft \
constitution had been finished and submitted to the General \
People's Committee (cabinet-equivalent) for approval, and that \
it could be submitted to the General People's Congress for \
ratification sometime this year.  The UN Resident Representative \
recently told the Ambassador that Saif al-Islam had established \
a super-committee under the auspices of the Economic and \
Development Board to draw up plans to implement wealth \
distribution and privatization/government restructuring \
advocated by Muammar al-Qadhafi last March (ref I).  In addition \
to the fact that Saif al-Islam's public calls for \
political-economic reforms are seemingly at odds with the old \
school manner in which he has attempted to monopolize the most \
lucrative sectors of the economy - a source of irritation for \
his siblings - the changes he has called for would directly and \
adversely impact their economic interests and those of other \
conservative regime elements who have few fungible skills other \
than political loyalty.  Saif al-Islam's recent announcement of \
a regional organization that would publicly identify specific \
individuals who perpetrate human rights abuses and target them \
for sanctions has been interpreted by some local observers as a \
manifestation of his frustration with the slow pace of reforms \
 \
TRIPOLI 00000208  005 OF 005 \
 \
 \
and as a threat to conservative regime elements, many of whom \
personally played a part in the most serious transgressions of \
the late 1970's and 1980's. \
 \
¶12. (C) Comment (continued): Persistent rumors about Muammar \
al-Qadhafi's declining health have lent particular urgency to \
questions about succession scenarios, throwing into stark relief \
the fact that, absent a constitution, there is no legal \
mechanism by which to orchestrate such an endeavor and seemingly \
increasing the stakes for the sibling rivalry. Adding to the \
current tension is the fact that some of al-Qadhafi's children \
control military and security assets (Muatassim and Khamis - \
notably, Saif al-Islam does not).  Harking back to the bloody \
feuds between members of the ruling Karamanli family during the \
Ottoman period, a well-informed contact recently noted that it \
is historically not a good thing when rival Libyan siblings have \
armed militias at their disposal.  As Libya lurches forward with \
the effort to balance badly needed economic reform with the \
appearance of some political re-structuring - all against the \
backdrop of looming succession issues - the sharp rivalry \
between the al-Qadhafi children could play an important, if not \
determinative role, in whether the al-Qadhafi family is able to \
hold on to power after Muammar al-Qadhafi exits (one way or \
another) the political scene.  End comment. \
