Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). (C) Poloff discussed reftel points with MFA Americas Desk Officer Hind Kamal on March 2. Kamal reiterated GOB support for Kosovo's independence, but that resource constraints would make it unlikely that Bahrain could provide much, if anything, in the way of financial support. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
