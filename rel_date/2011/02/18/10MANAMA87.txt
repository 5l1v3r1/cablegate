The official Embassy workweek is Sunday through Thursday, 0800 to 1700.

¶5. Security Concerns: Manama is a high threat post for terrorism and political violence. Although there have been no terrorist attacks against either Americans or Westerners on the island, Bahrain is joined by a causeway to Saudi Arabia, a critical threat unaccompanied post. Spontaneous demonstrations take place in Bahrain from time to time in response to world events or local developments. Demonstrations are normally anti-government in nature and do not target Americans, but may turn violent and should be strictly avoided. Bahrain is very livable and generally safe, but the threat of terrorism and political violence requires embassy personnel to take active personal security measures, including remaining aware of their surroundings at all times and keeping current with local events and embassy security notices. Personnel should vary their routes and times of travel, maintain a low profile, and avoid confrontations. Any suspicious activity should be immediately reported to the Regional Security Office (RSO) along with identifying information such as license plate number, vehicle or individual descriptions, etc. The crime rate is relatively low in Bahrain. Unlocked doors, open windows, building wallets, or unsecured purses may invite crimes of opportunity. Common sense precautions necessary in any major metropolitan area are appropriate for Bahrain. Contact the RSO directly at DS XXXXXXXXXXXX if you have any security-related questions prior to arrival. Americans should note this information when traveling to Bahrain. ERELI
