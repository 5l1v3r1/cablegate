¶1.  (SBU) The Department's 2008 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) 
report recognized Bahraini activist Marrieta Dias as a "Hero" 
for her years of volunteer work and advocacy on behalf of 
migrant workers in Bahrain.  The recognition of Dias, coupled 
with Bahrain's removal from Tier Three, attracted extensive 
coverage in all local dailies and several reports and 
features on Bahrain television.  The media treated the two 
developments in almost every case as a positive story. 
Arabic papers have run a spate of stories on migrant workers. 
 On June 18 Akhbar Al Khaleej, usually not supportive of U.S. 
initiatives, ran an opinion column by Salwa Al Moayyed under 
the headline "Where are the rights for migrant workers?"  A 
journalist with Al-Waqt requested an interview with poloff 
about TIP.  A few news opinion columnists grumbled against 
U.S. evaluation of other countries on TIP or any other issue, 
but even these isolated voices acknowledged Dias' 
achievements. 
 
¶2.  (U) Post took advantage of the local media's focus on TIP 
by arranging a press availability for Dias, attended by local 
English and Arabic print dailies and Bahrain TV.  Bahrain TV 
aired a segment on Dias and the TIP report on its main news 
program on June 13.  All of the papers published a report of 
their interview on June 13 and June 14.  Dias told the 
reporters that TIP remains a significant problem in Bahrain, 
and combating it requires constant, coordinated effort 
between governments in receiving and sending countries.  Dias 
praised the IOM's ongoing USG-funded program (ref A) for 
successfully raising awareness of TIP and providing much 
needed training for government officials and civil society 
activists. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Print and electronic media also covered CDA's 
reception in honor of Dias on June 12.  Attendees included 
Bahrain Human Rights Society SecGen Abdulla Al Derazi, and 
Nabeel Rajab, the Vice President of the (unlicensed) Bahrain 
Center for Human Rights.  Sending-country ambassadors, MFA 
MinState Nizar Al Baharna, and other GOB officials were also 
there. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: Bahrain's removal from Tier Three and the 
recognition of Dias as a TIP "Hero" have produced a new and 
productive surge in public and GOB awareness of the 
continuing trafficking problem in Bahrain.
