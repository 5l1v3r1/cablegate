REF: STATE 158223 
 
1.Summary: There were no changes to the Bahraini child labor situation in 2007. Child labor is infrequent, and tends to be in family owned and operated shops. The GOB did not change any laws pertaining to child labor. There were no reports of children involved in trafficking, slavery, or slavery-like conditions. End Summary.

2.In response to reftel paragraph 9: The GOB did not change laws pertaining to child labor in 2007. A) The labor law of 1976 continues to generally prohibit the employment of children under the age of

Â¶16. Juveniles between ages 14 and 16 may obtain official authorization to work from the Ministry of Labor if they can prove an urgent need to provide financial support for their families. Juveniles who obtain such permission may work no more than six hours per day with a one hour minimum rest period. Minors may not work overtime, nor in industries deemed hazardous or unhealthy by the Ministry of Health. These regulations do not pertain to employment where the only other employees are family members. The law also prohibits forced and compulsory labor. In 2007, there was no comprehensive anti-trafficking law, although one was passed in January, 2008. The law prohibits any violation of public morals, which includes prostitution and pornography. B) The 43 labor investigators are provided with training to monitor and enforce the laws regarding child labor. No child labor violations have been reported. C) Neither the government nor the NGO community devotes resources to combat the worst forms of child labor. D) Education is free and widely attended. E) Statistics on child labor were not available. Working juveniles were found in small numbers, typically at their parents' shops. This does not represent a change from the previous year. There are no reports of children working in slavery or practices similar to slavery. Nor are there reports of children involved in trafficking. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
