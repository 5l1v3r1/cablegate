SUBJECT: BAHRAIN: NEW GOVERNMENT HUMAN RIGHTS BODY 
 
¶1. (SBU) King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa issued a decree on 
November 11 establishing a National Human Rights Authority 
(NHRA).  According to local press reporting, the new body 
will review human rights complaints, work with international 
and domestic human rights organizations, and advise the 
government on human rights-related legislation.  The twenty 
yet-to-be-appointed members will be drawn from the 
government, NGOs, and academia. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Formation of the NHRA is the GOB's response 
to a formal recommendation made during its UN Universal 
Periodic Review earlier this year.  Post will follow the 
selection process and engage with members to gain a better 
understanding of how the NHRA will define its mission.
