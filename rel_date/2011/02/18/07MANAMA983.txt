INDIVIDUALS UNDER U.S. EXECUTIVE ORDERS REF: STATE 148605 

Classified By: DCM Christopher Henzel for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

1.(U) Econoff October 28 delivered reftel demarche concerning designations of Iranian entities and individuals under U.S. Executive Orders to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director of Bilateral Affairs, Dr. Dhafer Alumran, and Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) Governor Rashid Al Miraj.

2.(C) Al Miraj told Econoff October 29 that the Embassy non-paper had arrived contemporaneously with news reports regarding the designations. These designations were consistent with his expectations based on prior conversations with Emboffs and U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Stuart Levy. The CBB had already begun to scrutinize transactions involving Iranian entities more than ever and had encouraged financial institutions operating in Bahrain to do the same. Al Miraj also said he believed the Central Bank of Iran did not currently maintain any accounts in Bahrain. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX********************************************* ******** ERELI
