¶1.  (C)  Ambassador Saeed Al Faihani, advisor to Foreign Minister Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad Al Khalifa, told us August 20 that the Foreign Minister was still hoping to follow up on Crown Prince Salman's "Washington Post" op-ed of July 16.

¶2. (C) Faihani confirmed to DCM that he is in contact with at least one Israeli journalist -- from "Ha'aretz" -- and that the Foreign Minister is seeking clearance from Bahrain's leadership to grant an interview. In earlier conversations, the FM has told us that he wishes to address ordinary Israelis directly and help strengthen the constituency for compromise.

¶3. (C) With many of Bahrain's leaders just this week returning from summer vacations, Faihani expected GOB decision-making to start moving again. Faihani added that an interview might be granted by the Foreign Minister or Crown Prince in New York during UNGA. ERELI
