Classified By: CDA Marc Desjardins, E.O. 12958 reasons (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali and Italian 
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi deepened their ties of 
friendship August 18 with a day-long personal visit. 
Berlusconi arrived mid-morning and stayed until late in the 
afternoon.  The visit was so private in nature that neither 
the Italian or Tunisian MFA were involved or even fully aware 
of the details.  According to the Italian Embassy Commercial 
Counselor, this latest meeting had been planned to take place 
at Berlusconi's estate in Sardinia, but instead was held at 
Ben Ali's Carthage residence.  The two leaders ate lunch and 
held ""side conversations"" about business.  Berlusconi later 
gave an interview on the Tunisian satellite TV channel Nessma 
(of which he is a part-owner) in which he discussed 
Italian-Maghreb cooperation and, according to local press 
reports, told jokes about President Obama and the Pope (NFI). 
 In the interview, he also stated that he wanted to be 
remembered ""as the head of government who was able to defeat 
the Mafia."" 
 
¶2. (C) Berlusconi was accompanied only by Tarak Ben Ammar, a 
long-time business associate and advisor.  Ben Ammar, of 
Corsican-Tunisian parentage and a nephew of former President 
Bourguiba, partnered with Berlusconi in 1989 to form the 
Paris-based production and distribution company Quinta 
Communications.  Berlusconi named Ben Ammar as advisor for 
Middle East and North Africa in 2001.  Beyond his friendship 
with Ben Ali, Berlusconi's Tunisian interests include movie 
studios, distribution companies, and a 50% stake in Nessma TV 
which he shares with Tarak Ben Ammar. 
 
¶3. (C) Press reports added that Ben Ali and Berlusconi used 
the occasion of the visit to sign an accord to produce energy 
in Tunisia and deliver it to Italy via a new 1,000 megawatt 
submarine cable.  In fact, the energy accord was signed in 
July 2003 and gave way to a joint venture between the 
state-owned Societe Tunisienne d'Electricite et de Gaz (STEG) 
and the Italian utility TERNA.  Tenders for the new power 
plant have not yet been released, but the project is expected 
to come on line by 2014.  Italian companies are poised to 
compete for the tender to build the new power plant, and will 
compete to power the line with a mix of coal and wind power.
