¶1.  In the early morning hours of February 17, 2009, an apparent 
attack was launched in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace 
in Malabo, Equatorial Guineas.  While reports remain sketchy, at 
least two speedboats with armed attackers were apparently 
engaged by EG military before dawn.  Gunfire, to include 
automatic weapons fire, could be heard for more than an hour 
from various points downtown near the old port.  In response, 
the GREG has closed the ports of Malabo and Luba as well as 
airports at Bata and Malabo. 
 
¶2.  GREG officials report the situation is now under contol, and 
post can confirm that gunfire has subsided.  Increased military 
presence is in evidence around the city.  A warden message will 
be sent out as soon as possible requesting U.S. citizens limit 
travel to essential activities and to remain vigilant.  Post 
will also distribute the language via local OSAC channels.
