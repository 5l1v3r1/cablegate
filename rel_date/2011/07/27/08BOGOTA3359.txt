SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (C) UN rapporteur for Judicial Independence Leandro 
Despouy used his participation in a judicial conference in 
Cartagena organized by Colombia's judiciary to voice concern 
over tensions between President Uribe and the Supreme Court. 
At the conference, Supreme Court President Ricaurte
complained that Uribe's constant verbal attacks on the Court 
threaten its independence.  Uribe criticized Despouy for 
commenting on Colombia's internal affairs without hearing the 
GOC's side of the story.Despouy later met with Uribe and 
other top GOC officials, and said Colombia's institutions are 
healthy enough to resolve the row without UN intervention. 
Still, Presidential adviser Jose ObdulioGaviria told us the 
executive-judicial conflict would continue because Uribe is 
in no mood to "surrender" to a court he believes is in league 
with the opposition.   End Summary. 

UN "WORRIED" BY RICAURTE CLAIMS 
------------------------------- 

¶2.  (U) Supreme Court President Javier Ricaurte, along with 
the presidents of Colombia's other high courts, met with UN 
judicial envoy Leandro Despouy on September 4 in Cartagena to 
complain that President Uribe's verbal agression against the 
Courts threaten their "independence."  Despouy told the media 
he is worried by Ricaurte's claims and noted his perception 
that the executive-court conflict was worsening.  Both sides, 
he claimed, had eschewed dialogue and were feuding through 
the media.  Despouy, who was attending a judicial conference 
in Cartagena at the invitation of the Colombian judiciary, 
said he would continue to monitor the situation, but added 
that he was not in Colombia on an official UN mission. 

¶3. (U)  PresidentAlvaro Uribe criticzedDespouy's
statements, saying the UN representative should "properly 
study the issues before making statements that make the 
country appear suspicious."  Uribe suggested that Ricaurte
apologize for his claims, and reiterated that Colombia's 
democracy respects judicial independence.  He blasted 
Ricaurte for claiming the GOC's proposed judicial reform 
package (reftel) could lead to impunity for para-politicians. 
 Uribe chastised the Court for its "slowness" in 
investigating Colombia politicians with alleged ties to the 
FARC.  He also criticized the Court for insisting that Yidis
Medina--convicted of accepting bribes in Uribe's first 
reelection effort--be placed in house arrest, noting that she 
also faces kidnapping charges. 

GOOD UN-URIBE MEETING 
--------------------- 

¶4.  (U) Despouy met for several hours on September 8 with 
Uribe, Justice and Interior Minister Fabio Valencia Cossio, 
and Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez, and later told the press 
he was confident that Colombia's judicial institutions remain 
independent.  Both sides would find adequate institutional 
channels to resolve the problem, he added.  Despouy declined 
to offer an opinion on the judicial reform proposal, saying 
the issue was an internal Colombian matter.  Still, he 
suggested that Colombia's judiciary should be involved in any 
judicial reform effort, and he reiterated his offer to serve 
as a mediator between the branches to help reduce tensions. 

CASA DE NARINO IN NO MOOD TO COMPROMISE 
--------------------------------------- 

¶5.  (C)  Presidential adviser Jose ObdulioGaviria told us 
Uribe's battles with the Supreme Court would continue.  He 
dismissed Vice President Francisco Santos' call for an 
executive-judicial truce, saying Uribe is in no mood to 
"surrender" to a court in league with Marxists and the 
opposition.  Gaviria added that Ricaurte has been on 
television more than most presidential candidates, and 
claimed that human groups from Europe and the United States 
have manipulated the court issue to try to discredit the GOC. 


¶6. (C)  President of the House of Representatives, 

Representative German Baron, also said the Uribe-Court 
tensions would likely worsen.   He added that the Uribe-Court 
conflict would likely become more personal and nasty in 
coming months as Uribe's controversial judicial reform bill 
and legislation providing for a referendum on a 
constitutional amendment that would allow for a possible 
third Uribe term slogged through the Congress--all to the 
detriment of Uribe, the Courts, Congress, and Colombia.
