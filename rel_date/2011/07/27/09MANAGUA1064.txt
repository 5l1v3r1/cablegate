SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Office of the Property Superintendant has issued 
agrarian reform titles for beachfront property owned by U.S. 
citizen Miguel Angel Arguello and intends to take over more of his 
land.  Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) supporters with 
agrarian reform titles have invaded his property and have refused 
to leave it.  The Attorney General's Office has not taken any 
action to protect Mr. Arguello's property. 
 
GENESIS OF DISPUTE 
------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) In December 1993, the father of U.S. citizen Miguel Angel 
Arguello purchased 1,754 acres of beachfront property in Tola 
municipality (Department of Rivas), southern Nicaragua.  In May 
1997, Mr. Arguello purchased the property from his father.  In 
August 1999, Mr. Arguello registered an additional 122 acres of 
beachfront property after he conducted a survey to correct the size 
of his property.  In May 2000, the Attorney General's Office filed 
a lawsuit in court to nullify the registration of the 122 acres in 
the Public Property Registry.  The Attorney General's Office 
alleged that the land was state property and Mr. Arguello had 
acquired it illegally.  In September 2004, the Rivas District Court 
ruled in favor or Mr. Arguello.  The Attorney General's Office 
subsequently appealed the verdict but the Rivas Appellate Court 
upheld the lower court's decision in April 2005. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In February 2007, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) 
validated a 1988 agrarian reform title for the 122 acre property 
belonging to Mr. Arguello, despite the fact that previous 
governments had determined that this title was counterfeit.  In 
November 2007, the Attorney General's Office employed a regulation 
dating back to 1904 to register his land as state-owned property. 
In late December 2008, approximately 25 FSLN supporters with 
agrarian reform titles issued by Property Superintendant Yara Perez 
invaded the 122 acre beachfront property (reftel).  The squatters 
have built four shacks on his property.  Mr. Arguello initially 
requested assistance from Tola municipal officials and the 
Nicaraguan National Police to remove the squatters, but they 
refused to get involved. 
 
CLAIMANT SEEKS AMICABLE RESOLUTION 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) On January 23, Mr. Arguello asked for Embassy assistance 
to request a meeting with Attorney General Hernan Estrada to 
discuss the case.  On January 27, his legal representative met with 
Rebeca Zuniga, Coordinator of the Office of U.S. Citizen Claims. 
Zuniga told him that Attorney General Estrada would handle his 
case.  During the February and March 2009 property working group 
meetings, GON officials assured Econoff that Attorney General 
Estrada was handling the case.  On March 31, the Ambassador wrote 
Attorney General Estrada to urge him to review Mr. Arguello's case. 
 
PROBLEM EXASCERBATES 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) On October 9, Mr. Arguello told us that the Attorney 
General's Office has not taken any action to resolve this dispute. 
Mr. Arguello said that Attorney General Estrada and Property 
Superintendant Perez have refused to meet with him to discuss the 
dispute.  He noted that the Property Superintendant's Office plans 
to issue more agrarian reform titles to FSLN supporters to take 
over an additional 685 acres.  The squatters also remain on his 
property and there are approximately 350 persons in nearby 
settlements who threaten to invade it.  Mr. Arguello fears that the 
GON is organizing FSLN supporters to take over his property.
