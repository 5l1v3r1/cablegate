¶1. "Lesser Evil" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo 
editorialized (6/6): "Alan Garcia's victory in Peru's presidential 
elections is the triumph of a 'lesser evil'.... His alternative, 
Ollanta Humala seemed far more dreadful.  Humala was a retired 
military who participated in a military coup attempt and whose only 
credentials were a histrionic nationalistic discourse and Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez's support. He promised to prevent foreign 
companies from operating in 'strategic' sectors and wanted to 
industrialize the coca leaf production.... Although Garcia continues 
to be a populist leader, there is no reason to believe that he has 
not learned from the mistakes he made during his first term.... His 
main problem will be to find ways to reduce poverty, which affects 
half of the Peruvian population." 
 
¶2. "Chavez's Defeat in Peru" 
 
Center-right O Estado de S. Paulo's editorial commented (6/6): 
"There is no doubt that the greater one defeated in the presidential 
elections in Colombia and Peru was Colonel Hugo Chavez.  What 
happened in Peru showed how Hugo Chavez's interference in the local 
electoral process ended up in actually helping out the candidate 
that he did not want to see prevail.... In turn, Hugo Chavez's open 
interference in the electoral campaign favored Alan Garcia in the 
dispute, thereby forcing Ollanta Humala - who is unquestionably a 
Chavez's follower - to deny any link with the Venezuelan caudillo in 
a desperate attempt to annul the 'Chavez effect.'" 
 
¶3. "Mended Diplomacy" 
 
An editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (6/6) maintained: 
"Colombia may become a bridge between Brazilian private companies 
and the US market.... President Alvaro Uribe is aware of that and is 
willing to attract Brazilian capital to his nation by offering the 
opportunities that were created by the trade agreement Colombia 
signed with the US.... With the FTAA jeopardized, Brasilia will be 
satisfied with the creation of an informal consultation system with 
Washington to facilitate trade between the two nations.... Last year 
Brazil exported more to Latin America than to the US.... An 
agreement like the FTAA would have provided Brazil with better 
conditions to face powerful competitors such as China, but the 
Brazilian negotiators preferred to spend their time playing Third 
World diplomacy.... Brazilian exports increased, but they could have 
increased even more if the GOB had made more promising trade 
agreements.... The 'victories' of Brazilian diplomacy could be 
measured by President Hugo Chavez's disaggregating action and by 
Brasilia's weakness towards the impositions of Bolivian President 
Evo Morales."
