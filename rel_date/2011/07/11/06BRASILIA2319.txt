SUBJECT: IBAMA RESPONSIBLE FOR TOPPLING TWO MORE MAJOR ILLEGAL 
LOGGING OPERATIONS 
 
 
¶1. Ibama, Brazil's Environmental Protection Agency, has executed two 
major operations against illegal logging in the month of September. 
The first one, a three-week long operation, code named Guariba, 
confiscated 8,500 cubic meters of sawn wood and logs in the state of 
Mato Grosso.  Operation Guariba is a joint effort between Ibama, the 
Brazilian Army and the Federal Police with the goal of stemming the 
rate of deforestation in the Amazon.  Over 35 soldiers are stationed 
in the region and they have confiscated various equipment used by 
the loggers, such as trucks and tractors. 
 
¶2. The second operation, Kojima, took place in the state of Para. 
Authorities impounded over 25,000 cubic meters of wood and levied 
fines that totaled more than US$ 650,000.  According to Ibama, this 
is the largest seizure ever in the state.  Ibama investigated twelve 
timber companies during the operation and shut down seven of them. 
Four other companies were fined for operating without a license. 
Kojima is planned to continue until December. 
 
¶3. Both operations are part of the GoB's Federal Plan for Prevention 
of Deforestation in the Amazon.  The plan, in action since 2004, has 
impounded over 810,000 cubic meters of wood, as well as, issued over 
US$ 1,4 billion worth of fines.  Ibama and Federal police were 
responsible for eleven major operations in the Amazon alone. 
 
¶4. Following on news of Kojima and Guariba, President Lula and 
Environmental Minister, Marina Silva, declared a 30% drop in the 
rate of Amazon deforestation for the period of August 2005 to August 
¶2006.  According to Silva, Ibama undertook 95 operations in 2006 
arresting 379 people. If the decrease in deforestation is confirmed, 
it will be the lowest total registered since 1991.
