"Lula risks losing timing in Copenhagen" 
 
Analysis in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-4) by columnist Marcelo 
Leite: "Yesterday [President Lula] lost a good chance of speaking 
on the substance of global warming and global leadership.  The 
Copenhagen agreement, which should be done in December to replace 
the Kyoto Protocol starting in 2012, is on the brink of failure. 
The last round of negotiations in Barcelona is going from bad to 
worse.....It was an appropriate moment for Lula to show innovative 
leadership that foreigners have attributed to him.....Brazil is 
following the example of the U.S., which has not been able to reach 
a common stance due to domestic political difficulties.  The 
difference is that in the U.S. there is disagreement in the 
Legislative, not in the Executive branch......Brazil may certainly 
contribute to 'untying the knots' in Copenhagen.  It only depends 
on Lula."
