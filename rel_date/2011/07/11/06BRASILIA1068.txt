¶1.  Summary:  Mission Brazil proposes hosting a conference in 
September 2006 for all Entry-Level (EL) officers posted in South 
America.  Our proposal is based on our successful Mission-wide EL 
conference last year, and in line with Washington's recommendation 
to hold regular regional conferences and to promote the mentoring 
and career development of EL officers.  The conference would be held 
in conjunction with Mission Brazil's consular fraud training 
conference.  Depending on scheduling, it may also coincide with 
Assistant Secretary Maura Harty's trip to Brazil for regularly 
scheduled bilateral consular consultations.  As the largest aviation 
hub in Latin America, we propose Sao Paulo as the perfect location 
for such a conference.  Post seeks Washington's concurrence and 
support.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  Mission Brazil proposes hosting a September 20 - 22, 2006 
conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil, for all State Department EL 
officers -- generalists and specialists -- in South America. 
We are pursuing this conference as follow-up to Brazil's 
successful Mission-wide conference in September 2005 (ref A). 
This initiative is also in line with the Department's 
recommendation to "hold more regional EL conferences" (ref B), 
and Washington's encouragement to pursue more opportunities for 
"professional mentoring and the career development" of EL officers 
(ref C). 
 
¶3.  The EL conference could last for two-days and include the 
following sessions: 
 
-- Integrating public diplomacy into everyone's work 
-- Career Development Program requirements 
-- DVC with WHA A/S Shannon 
-- Consular training provided by CA 
-- Promotion panels for generalist and specialists 
-- Bidding process with mid-CDO focus on undirected tours 
-- Cable writing: What is Washington looking for? 
-- Balance between work and life 
-- Panel of exemplary EL officer outreach efforts 
-- Panels on various career tracks 
-- Changing roles of FSNs versus FSOs 
-- Mission budget management 
 
Additional suggestions on issues to be covered during the EL 
conference are very welcome from Washington, HR/CDA/EL, and the 
other South American Missions. 
 
¶4.  To meet the objectives above, we hope to attract the 
participation of senior officials in Washington, including from WHA 
and Consular Affairs.  As a cost-saving measure, Mission Brazil has 
already made the commitment to conduct its consular fraud training 
in conjunction with this EL conference in order to off-set the 
travel expenses for a large number of the EL officers who would 
attend.  CA is also invited to provide additional training to a 
large number of officers all at once.  In September, A/S Maura Harty 
may be in Brazil for bilateral consular consultations.  These 
consultations are held annually, have traditionally always taken 
place in September, and are slated to be in Brazil this year.  If 
A/S Harty's visit were to coincide with the conference, it would 
allow her to address a large number of EL officers.  Also to reduce 
costs, we propose that the conference be held in Sao Paulo because 
it is the largest aviation hub in Latin America with direct flights 
to most capitals in the region. 
 
¶5.  In sum, an EL conference provides unique career enrichment and 
excellent training and mentoring opportunities for officers, and we 
believe that a conference in Sao Paulo on September 20 - 22, 2006 
would attract EL officers from all South American posts.  I ask that 
WHA and CA take this proposal seriously as a way of investing in the 
career development of a large number of EL officers.  To make it a 
reality, we suggest that the other South American posts already 
block off these dates from regularly scheduled consular interviews, 
as we have already done.
