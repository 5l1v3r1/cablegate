Classified By: PolCouns Stephen M. Liston, reasons 1.4 (B and D). 
 
Â¶1. (C) Poloff delivered reftel talking points on July 2 
regarding Brazil's participation in the Missile Technology 
Control Regime plenary Information Exchange to Santiago 
Mourao, Head of the Division of Disarmament and Sensitive 
Technologies for Brazil's Foreign Ministry. In responding to 
Poloff's encouragement that Brazil consider making a 
presentation on some of the issues listed in the cable, 
Mourao was not enthusiastic about adding more presentations 
to the agenda, noting that the number of presentations 
planned seem like enough. In his view, a debate on each of 
the presentations would be more useful than adding more 
presentations, and he noted perhaps circulating the 
presentations among the partners ahead of time would 
contribute to the exchange of ideas on the suggested topics. 
Nevertheless, he indicated that the MTCR was very important 
to Brazil and that they would consider the request and how 
best Brazil could contribute to making the Information 
Exchange a productive one.
