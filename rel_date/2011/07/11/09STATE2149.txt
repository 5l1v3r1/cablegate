¶3. (C) Summary: Under Secretary Burns met with Brazilian 
Strategic Planning Minister Unger to discuss how the United 
States and Brazil can strengthen relations as we move into a

the relationship through a series of joint initiatives on 
education, economic development and energy.  Burns also 
raised the F/A-18 jet fighter bid as a means to assist in 
Brazil's military modernization. End Summary. 
 
 
Optimism for Continuing Relations 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Under Secretary Burns and Minister Unger met for 25 
minutes to discuss the future of the U.S.-Brazil relationship 
as we transition to the Obama Administration.  Both agreed 
that President Lula and President-elect Obama should take the 
earliest opportunity to become acquainted, hopefully even 
before the Summit of the Americas in April and the next G20 
meeting in London.  Burns told Unger that he thought early 
engagement from the Brazilians would be welcomed by the new 
administration given the importance of the bilateral 
relationship. 
 
 
Unger's Ideas for Cooperation 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) Unger explained President Lula is interested in 
deepening relations under this "atmosphere of great 
expectations.  Unger listed four areas that could serve our 
mutual interests.  First, Unger said we should identify 
projects that require a "magnanimous" commitment on each of 
our part and mentioned continued cooperation on biofuels, 
joint education programs and enhancement opportunities for 
small and medium sized businesses.  Second, in light of the 
economic crisis, the United States and Brazil should work 
towards reshaping and reorganizing global financial 
institutions.  Third, Unger mentioned the need for Brazil and 
the United States to work together to assist in Mexico's 
economic situation.  Unger believed Mexico was "in real 
trouble" as its agricultural producers and small to medium 
sized businesses had not found a way to grow.  Engaging 
Mexico on this sort of issue would facilitate discussions in 
other areas of concern, such as immigration.  Fourth, Unger 
said Brazil wants to play a role in the reconciliation of 
U.S. relations with Cuba, Venezuela and Bolivia.  "We have 
spoken to our friends" and it is understood that it will 
require significant steps on each country's part. 
 
 
F/A-18 and Military Cooperation 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) U/S Burns raised the F/A-18 Super Hornet jet fighter 
bid, stating the plane would assist in Brazil's military 
modernization and could help cement the relationship in other 
areas beyond defense.  Unger responded that when he met with 
Admiral Stavridis, Unger had informed him Brazil's need to 
move away from buying ready-made products with little tech 
transfer.  Brazil was interested in identifying areas for 
co-production and co-development of modern weapons systems 
and airplanes.  Regardless of what happened with the sale of 
the F/A-18, "our American friends" should begin a 
"trajectory" of trust and confidence between us.
