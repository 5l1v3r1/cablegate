¶1. (U) Please see action request in paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Econoff made reftel points to Marcelo Dantas, Director of 
the Division of Multilateral Cultural Agreements and Affairs at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Dantas told Econoff that he would be "quite frank." According to 
Dantas, the Brazilian Ministry of Culture representative who had 
headed the Brazilian delegation to the UNESCO meeting, of which 
Dantas was a member, and who had proposed Brazil's hosting of the 
Spring 2007 meeting, is no longer with the Ministry of Culture and 
no longer has any role in those decisions.  Given that the "team is 
likely going to change," Dantas said he was unsure whether Brazil 
would, in fact, host the Spring 2007 meeting and that this will no 
doubt be discussed on the OAS CIC September 6 conference call. 
While unwilling to rule out the possibility that Brazil would host 
the Spring 2007 meeting, he indicated that things are highly fluid 
right now with the upcoming October Presidential elections and that 
it was uncertain what changes might take place within the Ministry 
of Culture after the elections. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Dantas acknowledged the USG point that UNESCO and the OAS 
are completely separate entities and that they represent "different 
subject matter" and seemed receptive to working with the USG to 
promote a consensus-oriented approach within the OAS Cultural 
Diversity Workshop.  He said he appreciated knowing the U.S.'s point 
of view on this subject.  Dantas, however, will not himself be 
participating in the planning events (i.e. the September 6 
conference call or the November Montreal planning meetings) and he 
stressed the potential impact of the upcoming Brazilian elections on 
future priorities and decisions by the Ministry of Culture. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Action request: Dantas asked for a short written summary of 
the USG position that he could pass to the Brazilian representative 
who will take part in the conference call. Given reftel instructions 
that the talking points were not to be shared, post requests an 
appropriate written summary that we can pass to the GoB.
