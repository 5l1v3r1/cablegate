SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR PRESSES CAMBODIA TO TAKE FIRMER STAND 
ON BURMA 
 
REF: STATE 137644 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JOSEPH A. MUSSOMELI FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  In back-to-back meetings with Acting 
Foreign Minister Long Visalo and Prime Minister's Adviser Om 
Yentieng, Ambassador delivered reftel demarche, expressing 
U.S. gratitude for the strong ASEAN statement on Burma, 
noting that more would need to be done to support the Gambari 
mission, and calling for a separate RGC statement condemning 
the Burmese junta's violent repression of peaceful 
demonstrators and promoting reconciliation and reform. 
Visalo noted a newly released letter by Singapore's PM to 
Than Shwe in Singapore's capacity as ASEAN Chair as evidence 
that ASEAN had taken appropriate steps to date.  Noting the 
serious impact on Burma's neighbors of the military regime's 
behavior, Ambassador stressed that the Royal Government of 
Cambodia could do more.  Visalo took on board USG points and 
allowed that if difficulties remained, the RGC might look for 
another solution.  Senior Adviser Om Yentieng echoed Visalo's 
assessment, and noted Singapore had been contacting other 
ASEAN members and that PM Hun Sen had telephoned Foreign 
Minister Hor Namhong in New York to discuss Burma.  Om 
Yentieng cited a Cambodia-hosted ASEM conference in Siem Reap 
as evidence that Cambodia is supporting criticism of Burmese 
military wrongdoing.  The Foreign Ministry and Om Yentieng's 
office were coordinating messages to the UN Mission as a 
follow-up to the Ambassador's demarche.  RGC interlocutors 
are aware that FM Hor will meet with A/S Hill in the 
afternoon of Oct. 1.  Given that the FM often takes a more 
flexible approach to our strongly stated concerns, we urge 
A/S Hill to press even harder for more action by the RGC. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
Acting Foreign Minister Willing to Re-Consider 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  (C)  In a longer discussion reviewing reftel points, 
Ambassador told Acting FM Long Visalo that the ASEAN message 
was very strong and had sent the right message to the Burmese 
military regime.  Noting the junta's killing of defenseless 
demonstrators and the murder of Buddhist monks, and referring 
to the individual statements from the Philippines and 
Malaysia on Burma, the Ambassador urged Cambodia to issue its 
own separate statement on the situation.  Ambassador 
pointedly noted that in recent history the only other Asian 
regime to brutally kill Buddhist monks and rampage their 
monasteries was the Khmer Rouge.  Burma could learn from 
Cambodia and how it had emerged from a history of conflict 
and moved toward a more open democracy.  Moreover, Burma's 
situation was having a negative impact on regional stability 
in such areas as narcotics and trafficking in persons.  The 
Burmese military regime would listen more attentively to the 
bilateral exhortations of individual ASEAN members, 
especially from a country like Cambodia that was similarly 
situated as a small developing country in the region and 
might be considered a trusted neighbor. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Long Visalo thanked the Ambassador for his 
estimation of Cambodia, but noted that the ASEAN group had 
not only devised a strong statement but had given its support 
to the work of the SYG's special envoy Ibrahim Gambari, who 
was to call for meetings between all political parties in 
Burma with the aim of finding a solution.  Long Visalo also 
noted the September 29 letter from Singapore PM Lee Hsien 
Loong in Singapore's capacity as ASEAN chair, which threw the 
weight of ASEAN behind the Gambari mission and called for the 
release of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu 
Kyi.  This should be enough for now, he stated, and Cambodia 
would wait for the results of the Gambari visit. 
 
¶4.  (C)  When the Ambassador asked the Acting FM to press 
Foreign Minister Hor Namhong to be more assertive, Long 
Visalo acknowledged that if there was no peaceful resolution 
to the Burmese crisis, then it would be very difficult for 
ASEAN nations.  If the Gambari mission is not successful, 
then Cambodia could look for a different approach, he 
conceded.

Prime Minister's Adviser Only Slightly More Receptive 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶5.  (C)  Prime Minister's Adviser Om Yentieng responded to 
the demarche with the assessment that the Burmese regime 
would not give up power easily, notwithstanding ASEAN's very 
strong statement.  He also noted Gambari's meeting with ASSK 
as one positive development in that mission.  Om Yentieng 
stated that Singapore had contacted PM Hun Sen directly about 
the Burma crisis and that Singapore was in contact with other 
ASEAN nations.  He noted that PM Hun Sen had also telephoned 
FM Hor Namhong in New York to discuss the situation in Burma. 
 The Foreign Ministry and Om Yentieng's office were 
coordinating messages to the UN Mission as a follow-up to the 
Ambassador's demarche.  Om Yentieng took on board the USG 
points and promised to relay our concerns to the PM and to 
follow up as needed. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Commenting on a Cambodia-hosted conference with 
ASEM on freedom of expression held Sept. 26-28, Om Yentieng 
that many of the participants from 43 nations had used the 
occasion to condemn the Burmese regime.  A Burmese delegation 
was also in attendance, he noted. 
 
 
Comment:  We Need to Keep Pressing 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) COMMENT:  Although the RGC has taken on board our 
points and understands the critical situation in Burma, it is 
not clear that they are yet prepared to break away from the 
ASEAN consensus.  Long Visalo is constrained in his role as 
Acting Foreign Minister and does not have the ear of PM Hun 
Sen, as Hor Namhong sometimes does.  Post recommends that A/S 
Hill press even harder with FM Hor Namhong to consider 
issuing an RGC statement on the Burma situation, in 
consideration of our wider and deeper relations.  The 
Australian Ambassador told Ambassador today that she would 
press the PM to make a public statement, noting that its 
silence made Cambodia look bad and that it was time for the 
RCG to declare its outrage at the Burmese junta's actions.
