¶1.  (C)  Summary.  FUNCINPEC Deputy Secretary General Ung 
Huot says that Prince Ranariddh's decision last week to 
resign as National Assembly President was based principally 
on a desire to concentrate more on strengthening the party, 
but Hun Sen's personal attacks and the danger that he might 
be voted out of the Assembly presidency under the new 50% 
plus one rule were also considerations.  Huot emphasized the 
FUNCINPEC view that Ranariddh getting out and seeing the 
people might help reverse FUNCINPEC'S decline and benefit the 
party in the 2007 commune elections and the 2008 general 
election.  End Summary. 
 
FUNCINPEC:  Focusing on Upcoming Elections 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (C)  On March 8, FUNCINPEC official Ung Huot, accompanied 
by his assistant Sander Demontero, met with DCM and Poloff on 
behalf of Prince Ranariddh and FUNCINPEC to explain the 
reasons for Ranariddh's decision last week to resign as 
National Assembly President.  As reported reftel, Huot stated 
that the Prince was too busy with his duties presiding over 
the National Assembly, and as party President needs to be 
more involved to stop the declining popular support for 
FUNCINPEC.  Following his resignation, Ranariddh immediately 
started reorganizing the party, proposing that party 
Inspector General Prince Chakrapong and party Secretary 
General Prince Sirivudh swap positions within FUNCINPEC, and 
nominating four deputy secretaries-general: Chhim Seak Leng, 
Por Bun Sreu, Tea Chamrat, and Ung Huot.  Huot said 
Ranariddh's greater involvement will revitalize the party and 
it is important that Ranariddh has the will to make changes. 
He cited the 2004 IRI poll that showed Ranariddh had a 67% 
approval rating (the highest rating of any politician in the 
survey) while FUNCINPEC only got about 18% of the popular 
vote.  If Ranariddh can boost FUNCINPEC supporters' morale, 
the party's chances in the 2007 communal elections look very 
good.  Huot indicated that while FUNCINPEC's platform for the 
2007/2008 elections would remain based on the monarchy, 
development of democracy, and fighting poverty, the party's 
tactics will change, with Ranariddh himself getting out into 
the provinces to shore up local support.  If FUNCINPEC can 
win 40 seats in the 2008 election; in Huot's words, Hun Sen 
won't be able to kick FUNCINPEC around anymore. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Huot referred to the Constitutional change in the 
two-thirds majority rule in parliament as another factor in 
Ranariddh's resignation.  Huot said that since 2003, Hun Sen 
has felt like a hostage to FUNCINPEC and the two-thirds rule. 
 With 50% plus one now in effect, Hun Sen can shuffle the 
Cabinet at will, since the CPP has 73 seats and only 63 votes 
are required.  Although it was uncertain that the CPP would 
actually propose to have him removed, Ranariddh felt that he 
could easily have been voted out, so he resigned as a 
preemptive move.  Cambodia should be ready for political 
instability or true democracy, Huot said, because in the new 
system a simple majority in the parliament could vote Hun Sen 
himself out of office. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Although he feels personally insulted by Hun Sen's 
accusations of corruption and the improper role of a 
mistress, neither of which is new to Cambodian politics, 
Ranariddh wants the coalition to continue through the end of 
the current term.  Huot noted Sam Rainsy's "new face" since 
returning, and how Rainsy made up with Hun Sen saying he was 
wrong to criticize the PM all those years.  Rainsy then 
proposed the 50% plus one rule for parliament and Hun Sen 
agreed.  Huot said that with 50% plus one, FUNCINPEC can do 
little if Hun Sen and the CPP want to invite Sam Rainsy into 
the government; but in his view, the CPP would not do 
something that stupid and Rainsy would not be brought into 
the government before 2008. 
 
¶5.  (C)  At the end of the meeting, Huot noted that there 
appears to be a love-hate relationship between the United 
States and FUNCINPEC.  The USG and, in particular, specific 
members of Congress, had been too hard on FUNCINPEC, and 
relations are not as good as they once were.  DCM noted that 
the USG probably has more friends in FUNCINPEC than any other 
party in Cambodia and wants to maintain close relations with 
FUNCINPEC.  However, he emphasized that the United States 
supports the democratic process and does not endorse one 
party over another.

¶6.  (C)  Ranariddh and FUNCINPEC are perhaps reading too much 
into the two year-old IRI survey results and ignoring the 
realities of the current Cambodian political climate.  While 
Ranariddh's campaigning late in the 2003 election cycle did 
appear to pay some dividends for FUNCINPEC, it is unlikely 
that his personal charisma can have the same effect in the 
coming elections.  FUNCINPEC still needs to establish an 
independent identity and demonstrate it can deliver on issues 
constituents care about.
