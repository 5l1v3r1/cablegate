SUBJECT:  CAMBODIA SEEKS SUPPORT FOR WORLD HERITAGE COMMITTEE 
CANDIDACY 
 
REF: PHNOM PENH 505 
¶1. SUMMARY: Deputy Prime Minister Sok An formally announced his 
government's intention to seek a seat on the World Heritage 
Committee (WHC) and sought international support for its candidacy. 
Sok An cited Cambodia's deep cultural heritage and experience on the 
Angkor Wat International Coordinating Committee as justification for 
their candidacy. See action request in paragraph 5.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. In a ceremony at the National Museum on the evening of 9/7 Sok An 
announced Cambodia's candidacy for a seat on the WHC and appealed 
directly to the assembled Ambassadors for their support.  He was 
joined by the head of the local UNESCO office Teruo Jinnai who 
expressed his support for the country's candidacy while noting that 
UNESCO did not have a voice in the decision.  He noted that while 
Cambodia has been a member of UNESCO for over fifty years it has 
never served on the committee.  He asserted that if selected, 
Cambodia would serve the full six years of the term but would not 
seek to extend its tenure. 
 
¶3.  Sok An highlighted his country's unanimous election to the 
UNESCO executive council and subsequent service along with the 
Cambodia's experience since 1993 with the Angkor ICC as 
qualifications for the position.  He also stated that his campaign 
for the seat had started over a month ago and that he has spoken 
privately with a number of officials in an effort to gain their 
support (see reftel). 
 
¶4.  Sok An also expressed his country's strong commitment to the 
protection of cultural heritage and assured the guests that if 
selected Cambodia would fully support the 1972 convention and work 
to maintain the "balance and stability" of the World Heritage List. 
After his speech he told the Ambassador that he was "very hopeful" 
regarding U.S. support for Cambodia's bid. 
 
¶5.  Action Request:  Post requests Washington guidance on responding 
to Cambodia's formal request for support.
