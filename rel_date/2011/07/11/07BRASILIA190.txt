SUBJECT: TABLOID SAYS BRAZILIAN INTELLIGENCE SEES FOREIGN 
THREAT TO AMAZON 
 
¶1. (U) On Jan. 29, Jornal do Brasil (JB) published excerpts 
of what it claimed were from a "Situation report" prepared by 
the "Amazon Working Group," composed of intelligence and 
military officials.  The JB story described the "Situation 
Report" as the consensus of Brazilian intelligence officials. 
 The published excerpts highlight Brazilian concerns over the 
presence of foreigners in and around Brazil, including 
American military personnel. NGOs are also a source of 
concern, according to the report. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  JB (Rio de Janeiro center-right Catholic daily, 
circ. 68,000) is running a series on the Amazon with a 
sensationalist/nationalist slant.  JB was once one of 
Brazil's most influential newspapers but over the years its 
circulation and relevance have diminished considerably. 
Today it is not among leading national dailies, and is 
neither a newspaper of record nor an important tabloid. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The JB report sensationalizes the provocative parts 
of the "Situation Report" in the context of a series whose 
aim is clearly to generate concern about national sovereignty 
over the Amazonian region. 
 
¶4.  (U) Series front page headlines have been 
"Abin (Brazilian Intelligence Agency) Confirms Amazon 
Invasion" (1/29) 
"NGOs Support the Amazon Invasion" (1/30) 
"Government to Rent the Amazon Jungle" (1/31) 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In Embassy's view, the "Situation Report" is 
probably authentic.  Its conclusions may appear to be 
exaggerated and foreshadow a worst case scenario, but they 
are not wholly unreasonable when viewed as the product of 
military/intelligence officials who must forecast possible 
threats to national security. 
 
¶6.  (U) No major daily in Brazil has picked up the story.  As 
far as Embassy can ascertain, the only other coverage of JB's 
story has been Argentina and Chile.  The on-line edition of 
Argentina's La Nacion (leading national daily of record, 
circ. 150,000) ran a dispatch from Sao Paulo on January 31. 
The on-line edition of Chile's La Nacion ran an ANSA (Italian 
wire service) report on January 29. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment:  The story of foreigners encircling or 
invading the Amazon and threatening Brazilian sovereignty is 
an urban (or perhaps we should say "jungle") legend that has 
come up with amazing persistence in Brazil over the last 30 
years.  Fed by a perceived or imagined fear of foreign 
(especially U.S.) threats to Brazilian sovereignty, the myth 
stokes the paranoia of nationalist factions on the extreme 
right and left in Brazil.  It has limited currency in 
mainstream Brazilian society.
