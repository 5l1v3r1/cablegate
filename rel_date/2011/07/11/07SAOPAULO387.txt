¶1. "Elected To Change" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (5/8) 
editorialized: "Conservative candidate Nicolas Sarkozy obtained a 
clear victory in the French presidential elections. As a result, the 
Socialist Party had its third consecutive defeat in presidential 
elections. The 6 percent difference, however, shows that France 
continues to be a nation deeply divided between the left and the 
right wings. Sarkozy brings the winds of change.... What remains to 
be seen is whether these changes will really occur or if they will 
be no more than simply media effects produced by the campaign. There 
is no reason to doubt Sarkozy's intention to modernize France.... 
Part of the problem is that a significant number of French citizens 
- including Sarkozy's voters - oppose changes in the nation's 
generous system of social benefits." 
 
¶2. "Sarkozy's Victory" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo (5/8) 
commented: "The 38 million French who voted Sunday divided the 
nation into two parts - one left, another right.... No other French 
president believed, as Sarkozy does, in the qualities of modern 
capitalism.... There cannot be any doubt of what Sarkozy thinks 
about an open economy - except for the agribusiness sector.... One 
may question, however, if the new president will be able to start a 
profound reform in the French model - i.e., if an excessively 
supported society will accept changes that will alter its way of 
life."
