SUBJECT: BRAZIL UNRESPONSIVE TO CAE REQUESTS 
 
 
Â¶1. Embassy Brasilia has not been able to confirm a proposed date for 
the Common Agenda for the Environment (CAE) with the GoB.  Repeated 
requests to the MFA (Itamaraty) to verify a CAE date have been met 
with silence.  That said, Post is under the impression that the 
Brazilian Embassy in Washington has given tentative approval to the 
idea of a September 12 CAE.  Post will continue trying to contact 
Itamaraty and provide confirmation of a September 12 CAE, ASAP.
