¶1.  Action Request - paragraph 2. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On September 1, Marcela Carvalho, the Commercial Dialogue 
Coordinator for the Ministry of Development, Industry, and Commerce 
(MDIC), met with Econ Counselor to report on the Ministry's internal 
meeting on Dialogue issues earlier in the week.  Carvalho raised a 
number of items, several of which (i.e., dates for the next 
Commercial Dialogue meeting, discussion of industrial aspects meat 
production chain, exchanges on franchising, and cooperation on 
statistics) require guidance from Washington: 
 
--  Receita Federal participation.  Carvalho showed Emboff a signed 
letter from Finance Minister Mantega (who oversees Receita Federal) 
committing Receita Federal to participate in the Commercial Dialogue 
(and specifically any upcoming Dialogue meeting in Washington along 
with the planned "express delivery" visit to Memphis). 
 
-- Requested Dates for the next Dialogue Meeting.   Carvalho 
reiterated previous entreaties on the part of MDIC International 
Affairs Advisor Andreucci that the USDOC confirm a date (October 
12-13 of 16-17) for the Ministry's requested meeting between 
Secretary Gutierrez and Furlan in Washington.  (Per separate 
 
SIPDIS 
conversations with Andreucci, the GOB needs confirmation of the 
meeting date, inter alia, so that it can go about reserving scarce 
end of fiscal year travel money for Dialogue participants.) 
 
-- The Meat Production Chain.  Instead of discussing the meat 
production chain at the working level - as was done at the August 17 
DVC - Carvalho proposed that it be dealt with in any principal to 
principal conversation between Minister Furlan and Secretary 
Gutierrez.  She explained that Furlan did not want to discuss the 
sanitary aspects of the meat production chain, but industrial 
considerations instead.  However, prior to any conversation on this 
issue between the two ministers, the GOB would provide a non-paper 
better specifying its concerns.  At some point, the Brazilians would 
welcome a technical visit by USG experts to further advance such an 
exchange.  Comment.  We see this new GOB position as a diplomatic 
way to prevent meat from diverting working level discussions while 
still allowing Minister Furlan to express his concerns.  End 
Comment. 
 
--  ANVISA Participation.  MDIC is actively seeking to get ANVISA 
(Brazil's FDA-equivalent) to participate in the Commercial Dialogue, 
but so far has not received a positive response.  The week of 
September 4 Andreucci will meet with the President of ANVISA to 
follow-up on MDIC's request.  Carvalho promised to provide Acting 
SCO with a readout of that meeting. 
 
--  Travel of GOB Working Group Coordinators to WashDC.  Carvalho 
said that Brazil had postponed the travel of its Dialogue Working 
Group Coordinators (plus Carvalho and the Ministry's investment 
staffer) from September 21-22 to September 25-26. 
 
--  Franchising.  Pursuant to the decision of the Ministry's 
internal meeting on the Dialogue earlier in the week, Carvalho 
formally proposed that the U.S. and Brazil add franchising to the 
agenda, placing this issue within the export promotion/investment 
working group.  Brazil proposed sending a group of franchising 
entrepreneurs to Washington in November 2006 (led by MDIC official 
Anali Franzmann) to meet with U.S. counterparts.  In these sessions, 
it was contemplated that both sides would explain their respective 
regulations governing franchising.  Thereafter, Carvalho continued, 
a U.S. delegation could visit Brazil in June to attend the country's 
yearly franchising exposition and possibly the franchising national 
convention that same month. 
 
--  Statistics.  In the wake of the August 17 DVC and the visit of 
USDOC DAS Ana Guevara, Carvalho requested that the U.S. formally 
agree to transfering the issue of service statistics from the Export 
Promotion Working Group to the Business Facilitation Working Group. 
In addition, following up on suggestions made during the 
Ambassador's introductory August 8 call on Minister Furlan, Carvalho 
proposed that the U.S. and Brazil look at ways to harmonize 
statistics on the trade of goods. 
 
--  Training of Consulate Sao Paulo Personnel.  Carvalho stated that 
MDIC had scheduled training of Consulate Sao Paulo personnel in 
Brazilian trade tools (SISCOMEX, ALICE data base, "Radar Comercial," 
etc.) for September 13.
