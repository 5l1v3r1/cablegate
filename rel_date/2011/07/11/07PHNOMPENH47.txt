 ¶1.  (SBU)  On January 10 and 11, Pol/Econ Chief discussed 
the draft UNSC resolution on Burma with Sun Suon of the MFA's 
International Relations Department.  Post has passed the 
original and revised (reftels C and A) texts to the MFA. 
Suon flatly stated that the Cambodian government does not 
believe that a UNSC resolution will be helpful in moving the 
regime in Rangoon towards positive action.  He reiterated MFA 
Secretary of State Ouch Borith's comments to the Ambassador 
 
SIPDIS 
that Cambodia remains unhappy with the situation in Burma and 
will closely monitor developments.  He noted that he has 
discussed the USG request for ASEAN support for the 
resolution with Borith, who promised to inform FM Hor 
Namhong. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Suon took on board our points regarding the 
issuance of any negative public statements during the ASEAN 
Summit (reftel B) but was noncommittal.  He did note that he 
thought it reasonable to assume that the subject of the 
resolution would be a topic of discussion in informal 
discussions during the Summit.
