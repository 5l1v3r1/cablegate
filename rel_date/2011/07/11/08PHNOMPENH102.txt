REF: PHNOM PENH 74 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Deputy Assistant Secretary Scot Marciel 
paid a courtesy call January 18 on Kao Kim Hourn, Secretary 
of State in charge of ASEAN Affairs at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.  The conversation focused on ASEAN and the 
situation in Burma.  Kao Kim Hourn offered his candid 
perceptions of the current situation in Burma, noting Aung 
Sang Suu Kyi should be treated as a partner in an inclusive 
process that proceeds on a defined timeline --which could 
perhaps evolve from the roadmap.  Noting that more dialogue 
should be pursued, he said Cambodia could serve as a model as 
it had experience making a transition from conflict.  DAS 
Marciel stressed the need for Cambodia and other neighbors to 
press the Burmese regime to welcome UN advisor Gambari and to 
move toward a genuine dialogue.  The Deputy Chief of Mission, 
Control Officer Jennifer Spande, and SGSO Judy Moore 
(notetaker) accompanied DAS Marciel.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) Kao Kim Hourn outlined the Cambodian process for 
ratification of the ASEAN Charter, which will soon commence 
in the National Assembly.  He said the cabinet endorses the 
charter and expects Cambodia to be the second or third 
country to ratify it. 
 
¶3.  (U) Kao Kim Hourn stated that Cambodia's position on the 
proposed ASEAN human rights body had been established by 
Prime Minister Hun Sen in late 2006: Cambodia supported 
national human rights bodies and would create one of its 
own, and Cambodia supported creation of an ASEAN human rights 
body. He noted potential difficulty in defining powers 
granted the human rights body and distinguishing the 
respective roles of the ASEAN body and national human rights 
commission. 
 
Burma - Situation Complicated 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Kao Kim Hourn recognized the lack of progress in 
Burma's political situation.  He said that the Cambodian role 
is not an easy one, but perhaps Cambodia could act as a model 
of how to progress for Burma.  While the ongoing process (the 
roadmap) should be respected, there must be a timeline for 
moving forward.  He also said that the process must be 
inclusive and that Aung San Suu Kyi should be treated as a 
partner. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) DAS Marciel reiterated that the U. S. does not want 
instability in Burma, and that without political change the 
present situation could get worse.  He said that Aung San Suu 
Kyi cannot represent others when she herself remains in 
isolation.  He emphasized that ASEAN nations must weigh in 
with the regime to press for approval of an early visit by UN 
envoy Gambari and for tangible progress toward a genuine 
dialogue. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Kao Kim Hourn pointed out that elections are key to 
the democratic process.  He offered his personal idea of 
finding a way forward for Burma through an international 
conference styled on the Paris Peace process for Cambodia, 
also pulling in countries such as China and India which were 
supportive of the regime.  He suggested that one or more 
ASEAN representatives might visit Burma to evaluate the 
current situation.  Kao Kim Hourn intimated one area of 
concern is that other governments, views are not being 
conveyed by Burmese officials to General Than Shwe. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Kao Kim Hourn also proposed the notion of future 
political asylum or exile for General Than Shwe as a means to 
allow the process to move forward.  He acknowledged that 
Cambodia, as one of the newer ASEAN members, has relatively 
close ties to Burma.  He reiterated that elections are key to 
moving toward democracy and indicated holding elections is 
the only way to overcome the perception that a country lacks 
international legitimacy. 
 
¶8. (SBU) DAS Marciel cleared this cable.
