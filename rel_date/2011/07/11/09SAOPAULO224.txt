"The poisoned cellular" 
 
Op-Ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-15) by columnist Clovis Rossi 
states: "Smart guy this Obama. Introduced in the package of goodness 
for Cuba a poisoned dart in the form of cellular and 
computers....What's so smart about it? Simple: information is power. 
The ones that have total control of information, as it happens in 
totalitarian countries like Cuba, have more facility to control 
power and to extend the control for longer time....[Now] it won't be 
easy to hold the archaism of the regime." 
 
"Obama's policy for the Americas at the OAS stage" 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Econtmico (4-15) says: "U.S. 
foreign policy, now under Barack Obama's command, is changing in 
various fronts and is not clear yet which will be its Latin American 
face, it will begin to be designed at the Summit [of the Americas]. 
Its main axis will turn around the presentation of Barack Obama's 
intentions for the Hemisphere - not a priority in relation to the 
many and urgent worries of the U.S. diplomacy - and we should not 
expect much more beyond that....Lula's government will keep playing 
a role of conflict mediator in the region, a task that will be 
facilitated by Obama's agenda of seeking deals instead of conflicts. 
The main problem for Brazil won't be the U.S., as it wasn't with 
Bush, but its turbulent neighbors." 
 
"Gradual opening for Cuba" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (4-15) notes: "The 
modest release of those measures [to ease restrictions to Cuba, made 
by Obama's advisors and not by himself] was symptomatic....But 
Washington's attitude towards Castro's regime continues to be one of 
the most delicate issues - of internal policy - in the U.S. If the 
new president's intention is to review the relationship with the 
island, he left it clear that he chose to walk in this direction 
with calculated steps in order to avoid antagonisms with the 
Republican opposition in Congress and to avoid a surprise of an 
adverse reaction from Raul Castro's government.....At least, up 
until now, the Cuban regime is doing its part. It asked not to 
discuss the embargo at the Summit of the Americas and requested that 
the news [on the easing of U.S. restrictions] was aired on state 
TV... " 
 
"North Korea missile: reason for disappointment" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (4-15) by Republic of Korea 
Ambassador Kyu Hyung Cho notes: "....There was a clear violation of 
the U.N. Security Council resolution 1,718 [in the launch of a 
missile by North Korea]. It was not only a provocative act to the 
security and peace of the Korean peninsula and northeast Asian, but 
also a rupture of the treaty with all the international 
community....the attention of influent and responsible countries of 
the international community becomes even more necessary to exhort 
Pyong-yang to resume the dialogue and to go back to the Six-Party 
Talks negotiating table (U.S. Russia, Japan, China and the two 
Koreas)....What is expected from the N. Korea is that, as a 
responsible country and member of the international community, it 
resumes the dialogue with South Korea and be ready to open up [to 
the outside world] and make reforms that will enhance the quality of 
life of its people."
