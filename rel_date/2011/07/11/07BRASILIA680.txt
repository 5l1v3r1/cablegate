SUBJECT:  BRAZIL: MOJ OFFICIALS SUPPORT NEW PRIVATE INDUSTRY 
ANTI-PIRACY ORGANIZATION 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Newly appointed Minister of Justice Tarso Genro joined 
Vice Minister of Justice Luiz Paulo Barreto in expressing support to 
representatives of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), the 
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) and the 
Rio De Janeiro based Association of Record Producers (ABPD) for the 
recently formed Alliance Against Cinema and Music Piracy (APCM) at 
an April 12 meeting in Brasilia.  APCM is a collaborative effort by 
the MPA and IFPI and the first organization of its kind in Latin 
America.  It will provide logistical and intelligence support for 
on-going GOB anti-piracy efforts.  Industry representatives 
congratulated the MOJ on its progress in combating piracy over the 
past year and noted that the MOJ's National Council Against Piracy 
(CNCP) is both a national and international model that could be 
adapted to the fight against illegal internet downloads of films and 
music.  MOJ officials acknowledged the increased problem of internet 
piracy and were open to industry collaboration to combat it.  In a 
separate meeting afterwards, Barreto - who also serves as President 
of CNCP - assured IFPI representatives that he would drop his 
previous public opposition to legal actions filed by them against 
Brazilian end-users of pirated music.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) At an April 12 meeting at the Ministry of Justice in 
Brasilia, representatives of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), 
the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), 
and the Rio De Janeiro based Association of Record Producers (ABPD) 
outlined to Minister of Justice Tarso Genro and Vice Minister of 
Justice Luiz Paulo Barreto details of the newly formed Alliance 
Against Cinema and Music Piracy (APCM), a cooperative effort between 
MPA and IFPI. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Industry officials congratulated Minister of Justice Tarso 
Genro on the GOB's progress against piracy.  Genro replied that he 
was proud of the efforts by the MOJ to combat piracy and vowed to 
continue anti-piracy actions.  He welcomed the new organization and 
offered any needed assistance. 
 
¶4.  (U) MPA officials recalled the 2006 award their organization 
presented to Barreto, in his role as President of the National 
Council Against Piracy (CNCP), for "being the most creative 
anti-piracy crusader in the region" and noted a dramatic response in 
the GOB's anti-piracy efforts over the past year.  They pointed out 
that APCM will use MPA and IFPI experience in the production and 
distribution of entertainment media to gather intelligence in order 
to help the GOB fight piracy - benefiting both U.S. and Brazilian 
industry. 
 
¶5.  (U) Industry officials said that CNCP, an anti-piracy council 
organized by the MOJ, was both a domestic and international model of 
public-private cooperation.  They commended the GOB for apprehending 
over 50 million pirated CDs and DVDs in the past year, many of which 
originated in Brazil, and emphasized the need for continued 
enforcement activity against the sources of these items. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Participants discussed the ongoing threat of internet 
based piracy with industry representatives calling for establishment 
of a Brazilian model along the lines of CNCP to help combat it.  MOJ 
officials responded that CNCP is conducting educational campaigns 
against internet piracy, but were open to collaboration with the 
industry. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) After the meeting, IFPI representatives held a brief 
conference with Barreto.  An industry official later told EconOff 
that during the meeting IFPI participants convinced Barreto to drop 
his previous public opposition to legal actions by IFPI against 
Brazilian end-users of pirated music downloaded from the internet.
