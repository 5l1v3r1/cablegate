SUBJECT: PROSPECTS FOR FOOD SECURITY COOPERATION WITH BRAZIL 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: As the world's second largest food exporter, one of 
the largest sources of arable land, and a long experience in 
developing new seed varieties and agricultural practices, Brazil is 
natural partner for addressing global food security.  As part of the 
Economic Policy Dialogue (EPD) process the Mission has engaged the 
GOB on trilateral collaboration projects in Africa and Haiti, 
including the design of a joint project with USAID/Mozambique for 
agriculture research and innovation.  The initiative is intended to 
promote more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices as 
well as reinforce growing U.S.-Brazilian cooperation in Africa.  The 
Mission is also exploring mechanisms for partnering with U.S. 
companies in Brazil to expand the initiative, including 
collaboration in areas such as satellite imagery for land use, 
financing for agricultural input suppliers, and biotechnology.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
Trilateral Cooperation in Mozambique 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) As a result of the October 2008 EPD meeting in Brasilia, the 
USG and GOB agreed to expand cooperation between USAID and the GOB's 
development agency (ABC) into countries of common interests in 
Africa and Haiti.  The first joint collaboration project has already 
been launched to support HIV/AIDs programs in Mozambique.  USAID and 
GOB officials have both completed respective visits to Brazil and 
Mozambique to review current and planned projects, in order to 
determine the most appropriate means of collaboration.  ABC and 
USAID will soon formalize this collaboration to include ABC 
financial support for a civil society program to compliment 
USAID/Mozambique and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) HIV/AIDs 
program in Mozambique. 
 
¶3. (U) Regarding food security, ABC, Brazil's Organization of 
Agriculture Research (EMBRAPA), and USAID have formed a technical 
team to develop a collaborative program linking EMBRAPA to USAID's 
agriculture technology development and delivery portfolio in 
Mozambique.  The technical team completed its initial assessment in 
Maputo in June 2009 and will meet again in late July to formalize a 
detailed project proposal for funding consideration in FY10.  From 
the preliminary findings, the joint project is likely to focus on 
activities relating to seed systems and soil fertility. 
 
Bringing in the Private Sector 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) On July 7, the Ambassador met with Domingo Lastra, President 
of ADM Brazil, Marcelo Martins, President of Cargill Brazil, and 
Geraldo Berger, Regulatory Affairs Director for Monsanto Brazil, to 
discuss prospects for partnering with the U.S. private sector on 
food security.  All three company representatives welcomed 
U.S.-Brazilian cooperation in Mozambique as an important first step 
and pledged to identify mechanisms for contributing know-how to the 
pilot agricultural research center. 
 
¶5. (U) Looking beyond the pilot activity, ADM President Lastra 
suggested U.S.-Brazilian cooperation on satellite imagery as an 
additional potential area of collaboration.  Lastra identified 
mapping as a key tool for maximizing efficient and sustainable land 
use, including the application of fertilizers and utilization of 
particular seed varieties to increase crop yields and minimize water 
use.  He and Monsanto Director Berger noted that many agricultural 
technology companies have extensive expertise in analyzing such 
imagery, which they could potentially contribute to an expanded food 
security initiative. 
 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
¶6. (U) Ambassador Sobel encouraged the companies to further explore 
possible linkages between their commercial activities and USG-GOB 
collaboration.  In particular, the Ambassador highlighted the World 
Bank, U.S. Export-Import Bank (EX-IM) and Trade Development 
Administration (USTDA) as potential sources of financing and 
feasibility studies to maximize agro-industrial output in Brazil and 
abroad.  He also pointed out potential partnerships with the United 
Nations World Food Program (WFP) and the Food and Agricultural 
Organization (FAO). 
 
¶7. (U) The company representatives agreed to more closely examine by 
July 30 how they might assist with an imagery cooperation initiative 
as well as identify possible partnerships with USG, GOB, and 
international agencies to increase global food security.  Post will 
continue to follow-up on the Mozambique pilot initiative as well as 
potential private sector linkages and keep the Department informed.
