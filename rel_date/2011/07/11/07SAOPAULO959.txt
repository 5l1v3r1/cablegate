SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: SOUTH AND CENTRAL ASIA: US REPORT ON IRAN'S 
NUCLEAR PROGRAM; SAO PAULO 
 
 
"Power to Diplomacy" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (12/5) 
editorialized: "The US intelligence services report saying that Iran 
suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003, probably due to 
diplomatic pressures, had the effect of a bomb.... The change of 
evaluation alters the parameters under which the debate on the 
Iranian nuclear threat had been treated. A few weeks ago, President 
George W. Bush stated that Tehran's nuclear ambitions could provoke 
a third world war. With the new report, it will be more difficult to 
convince the international community to approve further and tougher 
sanctions against Iran.... The new evaluation reinforces the 
Democrats' speech, according to which diplomacy is preferable to a 
military action, an option supported by White House hawks like Vice 
President Dick Cheney.... The result of the intelligence agencies' 
change of opinion is a positive one. The risk of another military 
adventure was reduced, while diplomacy gained more room."
