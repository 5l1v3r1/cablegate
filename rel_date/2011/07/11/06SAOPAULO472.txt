¶1. "Growing Tensions In South America" 
 
University Professor Sergio Amaral maintained in center-right O 
Estado de S. Paulo (5/4): "To understand the reason for the tension 
in South America it is necessary to keep in mind three facts: the 
emergence of social movements in the Latin American political 
scenario, the divisive factor represented by the FTAA, and the 
successive disagreements among Mercosul partners. South America is 
living a new momentum.... Now it is the social movements' turn. 
Latin American societies respect democracy and no longer reject 
liberalizing reforms, but are questioning why their region is 
growing less than the average of developing economies. Some nations, 
such as Brazil, have grown less than the African average.... The 
lack of a convincing answer, both from the right and the left wings, 
is leading to an increasing social dissatisfaction.... Those who 
overthrew governments in Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia were not 
generals, but from social movements and street demonstrations.  The 
legitimacy of their demands and the lack of prospects for their 
requests are behind the so-called left leaning of Latin America. 
More than that, they are conditioning presidential elections and 
influencing the foreign policy in several nations." 
 
¶2. "GOB's Defeat" 
 
Center-right O Estado de S. Paulo editorialized (5/4): "The 
transformation of Bolivia into a Venezuelan satellite, which became 
clear in the meeting between their presidents and dictator Fidel 
Castro in Havana two days before Evo Morales signed a decree 
nationalizing oil reserves, represents a major problem for the 
stability of relations between South American nations. What is 
worse, however, is the GOB's passiveness in view of the new and 
worrisome regional scenario.... The GOB's passivity became much more 
apparent in the reaction - or the lack of it - to Morales' 
decision." 
 
¶3. "Morales' Reasons" 
 
Economic columnist Luis Nassif commented (5/4) in liberal Folha de 
¶S. Paulo: "There is an obvious exaggeration in blaming the Brazilian 
foreign policy for the Evo Morales episode.  Brazil's foreign policy 
did not elect Morales and will probably facilitate contacts with 
him.... Bolivia has enormous mineral resources and but lives in 
African-type poverty.... Morales is facing challenges in his 
political support base.  There is a group proposing insurrection to 
obtain power, and another supporting constitutionalism. Morales' 
recent attitudes have much more to do with the constitionalists than 
with the revolutionists."
