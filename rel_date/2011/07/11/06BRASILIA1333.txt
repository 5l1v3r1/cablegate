SUBJECT: BRAZIL SPONSORS REFLECTIVE RACIAL CONFERENCE 
 
 
¶1. Poloff participated in a June 29 meeting hosted by Itamaraty and 
SEPPIR (Special Secretariat of Policies for the Promotion of Racial 
Equality), an advisory body to the Presidency, which aimed to 
explain in more detail the Regional American Conference on Advances 
and Challenges in the Action Plan against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerances.  The 
conference will take place in Brasilia, July 26-28, 2006.  The 
overarching aim of the conference is to bring OAS (Organization of 
American States) nations together and provide an interactive forum 
between government and civil society to discuss the promotion and 
implementation of programs and policies and to increase the 
projection and visibility for the promotion of racial equality. 
 
¶2. Describing the conference as an inner-reflection on the politics 
of race relations in the region, Minister Matilde Ribeiro of SEPPIR 
affirmed multiple times throughout the discourse that the conference 
will not be deliberative in nature, but rather is meant to be an 
open dialogue of experiences.  When asked for the focus of the 
conference, the Minister replied that discussion would revolve 
around the Durban Plan of Action, its implementation and the 
associated outcomes.  According to the Minister, the conference will 
not produce a working document.  There will be two working groups 
(one governmental and one civil society) which will speak in plenary 
and a host of break-out groups (mini-plenaries) with a regional 
focus.  Additional information is available on the conference 
website in English: americascontraracismo.com.br. 
 
¶3. In total the conference hopes to attract 400 individuals, the 
expectation being that each country will provide four governmental 
representatives and four civil society representatives.  SEPPIR 
hopes Ministers of Foreign Affairs or a delegate of their choosing 
will lead each delegation and has sent out invitations accordingly. 
The conference is only open to invitees, pre-selected by the GoB. 
 
¶4. Comment:  Throughout the meeting it appeared that the GoB was not 
entirely certain what the conference would accomplish.  As a forum 
for high-level delegates to discuss racism, the conference can best 
be described as a grandiose thought-piece.  However, with no 
criteria for decision making and no impetus for implementation or 
even a working agenda, it is unclear what they expect the outcome of 
the conference will be. End Comment
