Digital Duel 
On June 25, 2009, center-right daily O Globo writes, "In spite of 
the Iranian government's best efforts to conceal the dimension of 
the protests going on in that country, a 40-second video shot by 
cellular phone transformed Neda Agha-Soltan into the icon of the 
'Green Revolution.' The person who bypassed the digital firewalls 
was a blogger who identified himself only as 'Hamid.'  A friend of 
his made the video of Neda's agony, as she was shot by Basij 
militia. Hamid sent the video to CNN, BBC, YouTube and the social 
networking site Facebook. Quickly, the youth's death shocked the 
world. 
 
An arsenal of new electronic resources makes life more difficult for 
authoritarian regimes. But the same technology that helps those who 
struggle for democracy is also available for those who wish to 
uphold absolutist theocracies, such as that of Tehran, and almighty 
political parties, such as the one in Beijing. The Berkman Center at 
Harvard estimates that there are over thirty governments that 
control their citizens' access to the web. One of the most obstinate 
is Iran. According to the Wall Street Journal, the regime makes use 
of a sophisticated mechanism that allows it to not only block 
messages, but also to capture information about the people sending 
the messages, and even alter the content of these messages-a way of 
planting misinformation. Authoritarian regimes' fight against 
freedom of expression has evolved along with technology. Before the 
fall of the Berlin Wall, West German police ripped out television 
antennas that received channels from East Germany. In 1989, the 
Iranian ayatollahs themselves declared war on parabolic antennae. 
China has a battalion of an estimated 60,000 censors to determine 
what citizens can or cannot access on the internet, aided by 
software known as the 'The Great Firewall,' a wordplay on 'The Great 
Wall.'  Much of what we know about what happens in Iran is due to 
technology developed in the USA by members of the spiritual group 
Falun Gong, who have been persecuted in China since 1999. The 
software is being passed on to Iranian dissident leaders. 
 
Nicholas Kristof, columnist for the New York Times, summed up the 
digital battle: 'The equivalent of the Berlin Wall in the 21st 
century is a cyber-wall, and we can help to tear it down.' One hopes 
that this will start to happen in Cuba.  Obama's good-will package 
to Cubans included authorization for American businesses to offer 
cellular, television, and radio services to Cubans. The question to 
be answered is who will be the most efficient user of these new 
technologies: movements in support of freedom or supporters of 
authoritarian regimes?"
