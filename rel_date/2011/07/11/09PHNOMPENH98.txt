¶1. (SBU) Acting DCM called on Cambodian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Secretary of State Ouch Borith Feb. 12 and reviewed 
Ref A talking points in detail.  Ouch Borith reiterated an 
earlier MFA statement that Kosovo is a sensitive issue which 
they are studying carefully (Ref B).  He went on to question, 
"if Kosovo is recognized, what about South Ossetia?"  A/DCM 
elaborated on the long process which Kosovo has gone through 
to reach independence, including efforts to protect its 
Serbian minority population. However, A/DCM's statement that 
there is no time like the present to recognize Kosovo's 
independence was met with silence.
