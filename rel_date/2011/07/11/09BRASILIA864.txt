¶1. (U) POLOFF delivered reftel demarche to Secretaries 
Mariana Flores da Cunha Bierrenbach Benevides and Bruna 
Vieira de Paula of the Human Rights Division within the 
Brazilian Ministry of External Relations' (MRE) Department of 
Human Rights and Social Themes.  Secretary Vieira indicated 
that with regards to Brazil's posture on Brazilian NGO 
Associacao Brasileira de Gays, Lesbicas e Transgeneros 
(ABGLT), Brazil will continue to support the concession of 
consultative status for the NGO, as it has done "since the 
beginning." The issue, according to Vieira, should come to a 
vote on the 27 July during the ECOSOC's session in Geneva, 
and Brazil is undertaking efforts in various capitals, as 
well as New York and Geneva, in order to gain support for the 
approval of consultative status.  Vieira added that Brazil 
would like to "count on the support of the United States" in 
this effort. 
 
¶2. (U) With regards to consultative status for the U.S. NGOs, 
DCP and DCWMF, Secretary Flores indicated that they had 
already informed Brazil's Permanent Mission to the UN to 
support granting consultative status to DCP.  With regards to 
DCWMF, Brazil still had not made a decision.
