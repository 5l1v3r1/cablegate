¶1. "The Terrorist's End Does Not Resolve, But Helps" 
 
Center-right O Estado de S. Paulo's Paris correspondent Giles 
Lapouge commented (6/9): "Finally, good news came from Iraq: Zarqawi 
was killed.... Morally, the butcher's death can only be saluted with 
relief. Zarqawi had a relevant role in the Iraqi chaos. What remains 
to be seen is whether his death will help to restore calm in Iraq, 
but that is questionable. It is wise to remember that the U.S. 
believed that the disorders had ended on the day its soldiers 
captured dictator Saddam Hussein in his hideout.... What can be seen 
in the Al Qaeda's case is that the death of one of its chiefs does 
not affect the movement.... In Paris, as in London or in Washington, 
if there is satisfaction on the one hand, on the other no one 
believes that the fire will now be extinguished. Not even Osama bin 
Laden's death would mean the end of terrorism." 
 
¶2. "One Is Already Gone, But There Are Still Hundreds Of Thousands" 
 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo's 
Washington correspondent Sergio Davila remarked (6/9): "Abu Musab 
al-Zarqawi was killed, but the fight continues. The US will try to 
take the maximum advantage possible from its partial victory, as it 
did when Saddam Hussein was captured, but the fact is that the 
leader will be replaced by another one, the insurgence will continue 
and the war between Sunnis and Shiites, which is what really 
matters, is not expected to be affected.... The major conflict in 
Iraq is not between Al Qaeda and the USG or the Iraqi government. 
It is between Shiites and Sunnis, like Zarqawi was.... Zarqawi is 
not irreplaceable.... He was the most visible face of the 
insurgence.... His death does not necessarily strengthen the 
Shiites. The Shiite Iranian regime gains in influence with the 
weakening of the Sunnis, but Zarqawi had already been seen as a 
problem by his followers.... The action that killed the terrorist is 
not only the result of the current harmony between the Iraqi and US 
governments. The first reports mention as fundamental the Jordanian 
intelligence and the testimony of Syrians imprisoned in Iraq. Others 
say that the Sunnis betrayed him.... None of the possibilities have 
been confirmed or discarded.... Bush will try to gain strength 
through these occurrences. The White House is currently working on 
this issue at hand as when the president's popular support hits 
negative records, the public opinion begins to get tired of the war 
and the reputation of the US troops in Iraq suffers another blow."
