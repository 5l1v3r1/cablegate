SUBJECT: Visit of U.S. NRC Commissioner to Rio de Janeiro 
 
¶1. (SBU) From 10-12 May 2006, Consulate hosted Commissioner 
Jeffrey Merrifield of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) for a series of meetings with nuclear regulatory 
counterpart officials at the Brazilian National Nuclear 
Energy Commission (CNEN), the Brazil-Argentine Agency for 
the Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC), and 
a site visit to the Angra Nuclear Power Plant. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Commissioner Merrifield's trip followed visits 
with regulatory counterparts in Argentina May 7-10.  He was 
accompanied by Kathryn Barber Nolan, his Legal Counsel and 
Jennifer Schwartzman, International Relations Specialist, 
Office of International Programs.  The visit highlighted the 
NRC's interest in strengthening cooperation with its 
regulatory counterparts in South America. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Commissioner began his visit to Brazil with a 
roundtable discussion of energy and nuclear issues in Brazil 
with Consul General Atkins and the country team.  Highlights 
of the discussion included: (1) the impact of the 
nationalization of the Bolivian natural gas industry on 
Brazil's energy matrix and economy, and Brazil's subsequent 
increased consideration of nuclear energy options; (2) the 
history and current status of Brazil's naval nuclear 
endeavors; and (3) current safety and security concerns in 
the area. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On May 11, the Commissioner visited the Angra 
Nuclear Power Plant in Angra dos Reis.  He was unable to 
visit the Angra 1 reactor due to an upcoming refueling 
outage, but instead toured Angra Unit 2, a 1350 MWe 
pressurized water reactor (PWR)  designed by Siemens.  The 
tour included access to the radiation controlled area, 
including access to containment, where the group viewed the 
spent fuel pool and various internal components.  The 
Commissioner also visited the control room, the diesel 
generators, and other portions of the power block. 
Commissioner Merrifield noted that the material condition of 
the unit was very good.  He then visited the construction 
site for Angra Unit 3, which is nearly identical in design 
to Angra 2, and is approximately 30 percent complete.  The 
Commissioner visited the warehouses where the components are 
being stored until construction resumes.  The site is 
currently undergoing an environmental assessment, and 
floodwater is being drained from the area in anticipation of 
a government "green light" to resume construction.  During 
the tour, the Commissioner discussed with Plant Manager 
Ricardo dos Santos the successes and challenges experienced 
at the two operating units. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On May 12, the Commissioner visited ABACC's 
headquarters in downtown Rio de Janeiro and met with 
Secretary Antonio Abel Oliveira; Mr. Ruben Novo, 
 
SIPDIS 
Administrative and Finance Manager; Ms. Iona Ponce, 
Institutional Relations Manager, and several other 
professional staff.  They discussed the current state of the 
U.S. nuclear program and priorities for the NRC.  Dr. 
Oliveira provided an overview of ABACC's history, mission 
and responsibilities in the safeguards area.  The 
Commissioner also visited the technical support center and 
viewed various safeguards equipment used by the ABACC 
inspectors, including cameras, other surveillance items, and 
equipment for sampling and testing nuclear materials. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Following his meeting at ABACC, the Commissioner 
met with President Odair Goncalves of CNEN.  Also in 
attendance were Dr. Laercio Vinhas and Dr. Sergio Bogado, 
who provided a presentation on Brazil's nuclear program and 
CNEN's licensing and inspection activities.  President 
Goncalves provided an overview of CNEN's history, structure, 
mission and regulatory responsibilities from nuclear power 
to medicinal radiology.  The group discussed the fact that 
CNEN and NRC share common challenges such as an aging 
workforce and possible review of applications for new units. 
They also discussed prospects for resuming construction on 
Angra 3, the current government's favorable attitude toward 
nuclear energy, and the expansion of CNEN's regulatory 
responsibilities if new power plants are constructed. 
Overall, Commissioner Merrifield was left with a favorable 
impression of the Brazilian regulator, particularly the 
resident inspectors he met at the Angra site.
