Chavez Radicalizes 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (1-27) notes: 
"....[Venezuela's] authoritarian gesture.....[suspending operation 
of a TV station opposed to President Hugo Chavez] reflects the 
current circumstances of Chavez's government.  The economic 
recession, rising inflation and 'Cubanization' of basic services - 
the country lives under water and energy rationing - are taking 
their political toll.....Trapped, Chavez is trying to limit press 
actions because....what supports the regime is his direct link with 
the masses - and a free press is always a hindrance to that....OAS 
Secretary-General Jose Miguel Insulza criticized the suspension. 
The American and French governments also condemned the limits 
imposed on the right to information.  From Itamaraty, not even a 
word....The Lula Administration's problem is adopting an opposite 
position reacting in accordance to its ideological proximity to the 
aggressor."
