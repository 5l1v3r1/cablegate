     ¶B. SECSTATE 146812 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On October 25, Deputy Chief of Mission Piper 
Campbell met with Ministry of Interior Cambodian National 
Police General Commissioner Hok Lundy to deliver the demarche 
on Hmong and Montagnard "material support" exemptions (ref 
B), following up with a letter to Hok Lundy.  Post also 
delivered the demarche in a separate October 25 meeting with 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary of State Ouch Borith. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Both Hok Lundy and Ouch Borith were accepting of 
the demarche information; however, Hok Lundy expressed 
concern that the U.S. might be asking Cambodia to allow 
individuals linked to terrorism to enter Cambodia.  The DCM 
reiterated the objectives of the exemptions, and assured Hok 
Lundy that the U.S. will neither ask Cambodia to provide 
refuge to individuals we believe meet the definition of a 
terrorist, nor process such individuals for resettlement in 
the U.S.
