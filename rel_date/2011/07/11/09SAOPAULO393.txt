Title- Diplomatic noise 
 
Main editorial in Folha de S. Paulo (7-3) states: "....the level of 
dissonance in President Lula's foreign policy over the previous 
months inspires care and explanation.  Brazil does it right when it 
sticks to principles and supports democracy and the return to the 
'status quo' in Honduras....But when the brutal repression involving 
protests in Iran are in place, President Lula turns himself into a 
man that is similar to one that attracts votes to Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad.  There are times and places in which Brazil needs to 
express, in adequate terms, its point of view, as a pacifist and 
tolerant democratic society.  The United Nation's Human Rights 
Council is one of these places.  The violent repression of 
dissidents in Iran is one of these moments."
