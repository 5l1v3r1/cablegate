"Democrat Fascination" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo (1/10) 
editorialized: "In addition to the natural impact of the 
dramatization of politics in the media, there are several factors 
combined to explain the unprecedented interest in the complicated 
process, especially because it seems focused on only one party, the 
Democratic, which has been in the opposition for eight years and now 
has everything to return to the White House in November.... What 
monopolizes the world's attention at the moment is the identity of 
the Democrat candidate, whose responsibility will be to restore the 
U.S. moral leadership that George W. Bush diligently dilapidated. 
The main reason for such a curiosity is the expectation that the 
president to be inaugurated in January 2009 will be what none of the 
predecessors was: either a woman, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, or 
an Afro American, Senator Barack Hussein Obama."
