SUBJECT: DISASTER DECLARATION FOR SEVERE FLOODING IN MARANHAO - 
BRAZIL 
 
¶1.  This is an action request.  See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. The  Ambassador has determined, based upon information from 
Brazil's Secretariat for Civil Defense and Maranhao State 
Government, that the severe destruction due to recent record 
Rains and flooding is of sufficient magnitude to warrant USG 
emergency assistance. 
 
¶3.  Continued heavy rains have caused serious flooding affecting 
over 85,000 state residents and over 6,000 homes destroyed.  The 
worst of the flooding is occurring in central Marahnao, with 
initial reports stating that this is the worst flooding in over 
40 years. 
 
¶4.  The  Ambassador has requested USDOLS 50,000, which will be 
used to purchase emergency supplies and support basic housing 
repair for the most vulnerable families in the hardest-hit 
municipalities within the state.  Funds will be channeled 
through the Red Cross. 
¶1. 
¶5.  It is not known at this time if additional funds will be 
required.  Disaster Relief Officer (MDRO) will keep OFDA 
informed if any additional requests might be forthcoming. 
 
¶6.  The cable has been cleared by Embassy Brasilia.
