SUBJECT: DEATHS BY LIGHTING STRIKE SPIKE IN 2009 
 
¶1. The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) has recorded a sharp 
uptick in the number of lightning strike fatalities in 2009, 
according to government officials and local media.  95 individuals 
have died from lightning strikes so far this year, compared to 90 in 
all of 2008.  Five individuals were killed on June 19 alone.  Dr. 
Seth Vannareth, Director of the Department of Meteorology (DOM) in 
the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) attributed 
this year's marked increase to rising temperatures, increasing use 
of technology such as mobile phones, and low public awareness of the 
dangers of lightning storms. 
 
¶2. According to Dr. Seth, surface temperatures on land and at sea 
have increased slightly this year when compared to 2008.  These 
higher temperatures have led to an increase in the development of 
cumulonimbus clouds, which are tall, dense formations associated 
with thunderstorms and other intense weather events.  Dr. Seth said 
that storm fronts made up of cumulonimbus clouds can often form 
quickly and are difficult to predict.  These formations can lie as 
low as 164 feet above the earth, raising the risk of lightning 
strikes to individuals caught underneath.  The DOM tries to issue 
weather warnings whenever possible, but there is no formalized 
system for storm alerts to reach the public. 
 
¶3. Dr. Seth also speculated that there had been more lightning 
strike deaths this year because many victims were using mobile 
phones when they were hit.  According to many scientists, the notion 
that phones and other small, metal objects attract lightning when 
carried outside is a myth.  However, some researchers argue that if 
an individual is carrying such an object when they are hit, that 
object or device can cause severe burns or other injuries, which 
could lead to higher instances of death.  Dr. Seth also noted that 
some of this year's lightning strike victims were farmers standing 
in pools of water that had been hit. 
 
¶4. When asked if the average Cambodian would know what to do when 
caught outside in a lightning storm, Dr. Seth acknowledged that the 
public is generally unaware of common safety precautions, such as 
avoiding trees and bodies of water.  The DOM began a public 
awareness campaign to try to address this gap, but budget shortfalls 
have limited the campaign's effectiveness.  The DOM printed 3,000 
brochures for nationwide distribution, but Dr. Seth estimated that 
about 10,000 more are needed.  She said there is no formal outreach 
through television or radio. 
 
¶5. COMMENT.  The tragedy of the increase in lightning strike deaths 
in Cambodia is that it is largely preventable.  The DOM addresses 
the issue as best it can, but given its resource constraints the DOM 
can do little more than react to weather events.  With a relatively 
small commitment to financially and/or technically support 
publishing of additional brochures and implementation of a 
television and radio campaign to highlight lightning safety 
precautions, the USG could help to prevent unnecessary future deaths 
and show a commitment to the well-being of Cambodia's majority-rural 
population.  END COMMENT.
