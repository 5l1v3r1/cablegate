REF:  STATE 19851 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Currently, ratification of the UNESCO Convention on the 
Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is 
not on the Brazilian Congress' agenda.   With the attention of the 
legislative branch diverted to the ongoing influence peddling 
scandal and the upcoming October 2006 elections, and the focus of 
the media and the public on the soccer World Cup in July, we doubt 
that Convention will be voted on this calendar year. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Post will keep Washington agencies informed should the 
situation here change.
