(C) PolOff met with Lourdes Puma, MFA Director General of 
Multilateral Affairs, on September 25, and shared reftel 
objectives on MINUSTAH.  Puma affirmed Ecuador's support of a 
one-year renewal of MINUSTAH's mandate and agreed that a 
focus on security should remain the main mandate, but added 
that increasing efforts in humanitarian and development 
assistance were needed.  Puma noted that Ecuador is strongly 
committed to its development assistance for Haiti through its 
military Joint Staff Engineering Corps, in cooperation with 
Chile.  She added that Ecuador's efforts have contributed to 
the building of an orphanage, schools, and roads in Haiti.
