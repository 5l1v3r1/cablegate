"Intelligence and Faith" 
 
Liberal Folha de S. Paulo columnist Carlos Heitor Cony wrote (5/10): 
"In a lecture he delivered last week, US Secretary of Defense Donald 
Rumsfeld was accused of having lied to the American people and to 
the world about the weapons of mass destruction that Iraq would be 
supposedly producing. The new fact was Rumsfeld's answer: he did not 
lie. He said he believed in good faith the information the US 
intelligence services provided to the Bush administration.... If the 
Bush administration and its secretary of Defense have good faith, 
the world has much to fear in regards to the US intelligence 
services, which apparently do not have any. Any nation can become 
dependent on Washington's intelligence agents and, of course, of the 
USG's faith in the quality of that intelligence. It is hard to think 
what the US will do with Iran, a nation that trampled the 
intelligence of both the CIA and the Pentagon and announced that it 
is developing its nuclear program independently. Occasionally the 
Americans claim to believe in good faith that Brazil will be unable 
to preserve the Amazon forest. Brazil does not constitute any 
potential nuclear threat, but a significant harm to the planet's 
ecology. The same government that refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol 
is, in good faith concerned with our trees and our wild animals. If 
the US intelligence services conclude that we represent a risk for 
the world, the Bush administration will in good faith make decisions 
to save Humanity from the Brazilian threat."
