 ¶1.  (SBU)  On August 22, the Ambassador and A/DCM met with 
MFA Secretary of State Ouch Borith at the latter's request. 
Borith provided a letter to the Ambassador from DPM and 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Hor Namhong to the Secretary 
requesting USG support for Cambodia's bid for APEC 
membership.  The letter, dated August 15, noted that Cambodia 
has made significant progress towards economic and social 
development over the past 13 years, and has expanded its 
membership and participation in other regional and 
international fora.  With the APEC membership moratorium set 
to expire in 2007, Cambodia requests the support of other 
APEC members for Cambodia's candidacy, he said.  (Note:  The 
Canadian Ambassador had alerted us that Cambodia was seeking 
support for its membership bid, having called her in the 
previous day.  End Note.) 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The Ambassador thanked Borith for the letter, and 
promised to pass it to Washington.  He noted that the USG had 
yet to take a decision on how to proceed regarding APEC 
membership, adding the provisos about the size of the 
organization and the need for reform.  Post faxed a copy of 
the letter to the desk on August 23; the original will be 
pouched to EAP.
