SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S FOREIGN MINISTRY UNDERSTANDS DEA ROLE IN 
REGIONAL COUNTERDRUG FIGHT 
 
¶1. (SBU) On November 18, Ambassador Sobel met with Brazilian 
Ministry of External Relations (MRE) Under Secretary for 
Political Affairs Ambassador Everton Vargas to inform him of 
our intention to increase DEA staff in our offices in 
Brasilia and Sao Paulo in light of the Bolivian government's 
decision to expel DEA.  Accepting our diplomatic note on the 
matter, Vargas said he understood how complicated the 
situation is and said that Bolivian Government Minister Rada 
had visited Brazil to discuss counternarcotics cooperation. 
What Bolivia wants, however, Brazil cannot deliver:  Bolivia 
wants to renegotiate a 1988 protocol on counterdrug 
cooperation to allow for production of coca leaf, but Vargas 
said that Brazil could not agree to this in light of 
international conventions it had signed. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Vargas also said that MRE officials had been clear 
with Rada that Brazil cannot replace DEA in Bolivia.  Brazil 
does not have the expertise, resources, or personnel to do 
so.  At the same time, Brazil recognizes that it is essential 
to help Bolivia fight drug trafficking; "We will be the main 
victims," Vargas said, if trafficking out of Bolivia 
increases.  Vargas pointed to the upcoming UNASUL ministerial 
in Porto Alegre as the venue where regional support for 
Bolivian counterdrug efforts would be discussed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: Vargas did not give a clear "yes" or "no" 
to the issue of increased DEA staffing, but the tone and 
substance of his discussion were unusually open and suggest 
an understanding of the potential problem for Brazil created 
by DEA's departure from Bolivia and the irreplaceable role 
that DEA plays in fighting drug trafficking in the region. 
Vargas identified Director of the Office of Transnational 
Illicit Activities Virginia Toniatti as the primary point of 
contact at the MRE on the matter.  Although she is generally 
resistant to cooperation with the United States, and the GOB 
has held up DEA visas in the past, the Federal Police have 
repeatedly expressed support for increased DEA staffing in 
Brazil and there appears to be a policy-level consensus that 
Brazil can neither afford to replace DEA nor allow 
trafficking from Bolivia to increase.  This bodes well, but 
only GOB issuance of visas for staffers slated to take up 
posts in Brazil will demonstrate a commitment to allow DEA to 
increase its presence here.  End comment.
