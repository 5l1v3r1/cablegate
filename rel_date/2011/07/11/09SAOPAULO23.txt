Title- Fake Diplomacy 
 
Column in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (1-13) states: "Brazil has been 
criticized by some for "condemning" the [Israeli] attacks in Gaza. 
This is just a pure facade.  Ask what concrete initiative Itamaraty 
(Foreign Ministry) or Planalto (Executive Power) will take to 
disturb the Israeli government.  Be prepared for complete silence. 
Nonetheless, in the world of representation, it sounds important to 
send our foreign minister on an excursion to the Middle East to 
appear in photos with the President of Egypt and shake hands with 
the Israeli minister who "doesn't see a humanitarian crisis" in 
Gaza.  . . . Brazil's stance is, in fact, the opposite.  Compare 
[for example]: for much less, if lives are worth anything, Brazil 
recalled its Ambassador to Quito, until certifying that the Correa 
Government honored its financial promises with a contractor.  In 
Gaza, civilians are being left to their own luck, manipulated by 
Islamic extremists and victims of brutal Israeli war machine. 
What's up Mr. President [Lula], are you going to call our Ambassador 
for a conversation?
