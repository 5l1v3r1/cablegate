(S) Emboff, accompanied by Canadian Pol/Econ Officer Juan 
Pablo Valdes, met with Jaime Freitas and Bernardo Motta of 
Brazil's Financial Intelligence Unit (COAF) on March 24, 
2005, to deliver reftel prenotification of the U.S. and 
Canadian intent to nominate Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LET) to the 
UNSCR 1267 list of terrorist entities associated with 
Al-Qaida.  Freitas, the second-in-command at COAF, undertook 
to conduct a search of COAF's own databases for any LET 
assets in Brazil, as well as to circulate the information to 
the Central Bank, Federal Police and intelligence agency 
(ABIN) for them to conduct similar searches.  Both Canadian 
and U.S. Emboffs emphasized the importance of the joint 
approach as signaling our shared USG-GOC concern over the 
importance of effective action against terror finance. 
Emboff also delivered the pre-notification to Luisa Lopes da 
Silva of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office of Illicit 
Transnational Activities.
