"Tehran's Trials" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (4/2) 
editorialized: "In scenes that evoke Moscow's notorious trials, 
British sailors and marines captured by Iran were exhibited making 
'confessions' that are as real as a three-dollar bill. If Iran had 
any standing in the dispute with the UK, it lost it by subjecting 
the prisoners to degrading treatment that contradicts the Geneva 
Convention.  The Iranian behavior exhales a smell of farce.... 
Everything indicates that in view of the gradually tougher isolation 
of its regime and the increasing U.S. pressure, Tehran has decided 
to harden its position. It did not have much to lose. The 
imprisonment of the Brits would create a new fact.  And their 
liberation could always be used as a trump card.... For those 
optimists, the episode is a signal that the UN pressure on Tehran is 
working and must be kept and even reinforced."
