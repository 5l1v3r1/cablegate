SUBJECT: RENEWING THE SUDAN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR MANDATE AT 
THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
 
REF: SECSTATE 55852 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  Brazil has not decided whether to 
support a resolution on renewing the Sudan Special 
Rapporteur's mandate, and believes dialogue with Sudan and 
the African countries in a cooperative spirit must precede 
the presentation of any draft resolution.  Brazil is willing 
to participate in such an overture and believes any other 
approach will fail, leading to polarization and a further 
weakening of the Council.  Brazil could support a resolution 
that stresses cooperation, not condemnation.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Counselor 
Marcia Adorno, chief of the Human Rights Division at Ministry 
of External Relations.  Adorno recalled that in the recent 
case of Sri Lanka, European countries introduced a resolution 
without first approaching the Sri Lankan representatives in 
Geneva, instead working only in capitals beforehand.  This 
approach is unproductive and should not be repeated with 
Sudan, she said, emphasizing that the way a resolution is 
presented is key.  It should be done in a cooperative and 
constructive spirit, and need not and should not involve 
watering down the content simply because it is being raised 
with the country in question or a group of interested 
countries. She said the first step toward renewing the 
Special Rapporteur's mandate should be dialogue with Sudan 
and the African countries.  She added that it does no good to 
renew the mandate without a negotiation with Sudan because 
then the Rapporteur will never be able to enter Sudan. The 
dialogue should attempt to negotiate the terms of the 
resolution, and Brazil is willing to participate in that 
effort, she said. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Asked whether Brazil would support a resolution to 
renew the mandate, she replied that she had not seen the EU 
draft and could not state what Brazil's position would be. 
Brazil is very sensitive to attempts to engage in dialogue 
with the concerned countries, she noted, and the text should 
be more oriented toward cooperation than condemnation in 
order to win Brazil's support.  With regard to how best to 
address the human rights situation in Sudan, Adorno said the 
same holds true: cooperation, not condemnation, is the best 
approach.
