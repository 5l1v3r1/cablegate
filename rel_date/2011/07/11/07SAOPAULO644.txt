"Humanitarian Disaster" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (8/1) 
editorialized: "The Bush administration's adventure in Iraq is a 
serious candidate to win the title of the largest political and 
military disaster in recent decades. The intervention, whose 
declared goals were to free the world from dictator Saddam Hussein's 
arms of mass destruction and bring democracy, respect for human 
rights and prosperity to Iraq, was a complete deception regardless 
from which point of view it is analyzed.... The invasion launched 
Iraq into a sectarian war that has already killed approximately 
70,000 Iraqis...jeopardizing efforts to create an effective 
government and throwing that nation into an unprecedented 
humanitarian crisis.... The final evidence of the fiasco in Iraq is 
the US's inability to restore the nation's infrastructure.... And 
the situation today only tends to get worse."
