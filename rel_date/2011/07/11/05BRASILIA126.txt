REF: SECSTATE 259661 
 
¶1.  Since the first Meeting of Parties to the Cartagena 
Protocol on Biosafety in February 2004, the GOB has 
introduced, but still not passed, legislation that 
would change regulatory practices concerning biosafety. 
Although, the bill is pro-GMO, it would reinforce 
existing labeling and documentation requirements. 
 
¶2.  Current Brazilian law maintains a threshold level 
of 1 percent for GMOs.  Products containing more than 1 
percent GMO should be labeled.  These standards, 
however, are rarely enforced.  If passed in its current 
form, this new legislation will maintain the 
requirement that food and food ingredients destined for 
human consumption be labeled as containing GMOs. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  The GOB is not likely to readdress this 
issue/bill until summer.  Post will update as more 
information becomes available. End Comment
