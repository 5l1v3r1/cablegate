SUBJECT: TERROR FINANCE - BRAZIL ASKS FOR DELAY, COORDINATION ON 
TBA DESIGNATIONS 
 
REF: STATE 192347 
 
Classified by Deputy Chief of Mission Phillip T. Chicola, 
Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (S) Per reftel, Emboffs, ORA, Legatt and DEA delivered the 
TBA designations pre-notification to the Foreign Ministry, 
financial intelligence unit, Brazilian Intelligence Agency 
(ABIN) and law enforcement agency counterparts on November 30. 
 
¶2. (S) In a follow-up meeting December 1, Foreign Ministry 
General Coordinator for the Combat Against Illicit Transnational 
Activities Virginia Tonniatti made the following points to 
Emboffs: 
 
-- the GoB and its counterparts in Paraguay and Argentina take 
seriously the common obligation that all countries have to fight 
terrorism and its financing; 
 
-- there is a common framework in the region (the three plus one 
mechanism) for working together to address such threats; 
 
-- the GoB is treating the information received seriously and 
the foreign ministry had immediately asked the federal police 
and ABIN to investigate in order to verify and clarify the USG 
information; 
 
-- in the Brazilian system, a judicial order is necessary to 
freeze assets and obtaining one requires that a formal 
investigation be opened; 
 
-- the GoB was "surprised" that the USG would plan to publish 
the list unilaterally on December 6 without first having 
coordinated on the information with its partners through the 
three plus one mechanism; 
 
-- there was simply not sufficient time for the GoB to advance 
an investigation to the point of being able to ask a judge to 
freeze assets by December 6; 
 
-- A unilateral USG designation on December 6 would be 
counterproductive, for just as the USG was asking that the 
designations be kept confidential to avoid asset flight, the GoB 
required that the information remain out of the public realm in 
order effectively to pursue its own investigation.
