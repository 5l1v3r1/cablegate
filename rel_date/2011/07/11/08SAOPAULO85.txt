¶1. "Advance In Pakistan" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo 
(2/22): editorialized: "Contrary to expectations, Pakistan managed 
to have calm and apparently clean elections, thereby advancing 
towards establishing itself as a democratic nation. What is bad is 
that the returns permit one to anticipate more political confusion 
in that nation that, in addition to being one of the world's most 
unstable regions, has become a terrorism center.... The US is 
applying  pressure to have the war on terror continue as a priority, 
but that has the resistance of influential sectors such as the 
secret service and members of the Pashtun ethnicity, who tend to be 
 
SIPDIS 
more sympathetic to Taliban.  Clean elections may have been a 
surprise, but they have not freed Pakistan from political 
instability and terrorist violence." 
 
¶2. "Fidel And Tediousness" 
 
Philosopher Paulo Ghiraldelli wrote in center-right national 
circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo (2/22): "Cuba without Fidel 
will continue to be a poor nation. Its inhabitants will continue to 
be treated without any respect by the government.... On the other 
hand, on the continent, the US will maintain the economic embargo - 
which is more of a symbol than what has really made Cuba reach the 
situation of poverty in which it lives today.... The Cuban people 
had its imagination castrated.  The same happened to the people once 
called soviets. If Fidel's retirement means the beginning of a path 
towards democracy, Cuba will suffer in order to learn what the East 
European nations have had to suffer to learn: emotion does not come 
from politics.  There is nothing exciting in spending a life as a 
'soldier of the revolution'.... The tedium of democracy is not same 
as the tedium of long speeches."
