¶1. (U) SUMMARY: Selected staff of the U.S. Consulate General 
Sao Paulo participated in crisis management training on 
December 6, 2007 and a mission wide Digital Video Conference 
(DVC) crisis management exercise on December 14, 2007. 
Observations and recommendations, keyed to reftel para 2, 
A-H, follow in the cable body.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On December 6 and December 14, selected staff of the 
U.S. Consulate General participated in crisis management 
training and exercises led by an FSI trainer via DVC.  Post 
thanks FSI for this opportunity to review procedures and 
practice emergency scenarios.  After the training, 
participating staff members remarked on the value of the 
training and discussed how to implement new best practices 
that emerged during the discussions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A. The Consulate believes that the DVC format was 
very effective and the amount of time (approximately two 
hours on the first day for CMT Overview training and 3 1/2 
hours for scenario run-throughs on the second day) was 
sufficient and appropriate for mission wide coordination. 
However, in order to stimulate more post specific interaction 
and team building more deliberation time after each scenario 
would be beneficial. 
 
¶4. (SBU) B. All scenarios presented were timely and relevant, 
ConGen Sao Paulo liked the wide range of scenarios and that 
many were specific to current events or potential situations 
specific to Sao Paulo and Brazil such as the possibility of 
an Avian Influenza outbreak and civil unrest as a result of 
violent prison uprisings. 
 
¶5. (U) C. The controller was effective and was very helpful 
in answering all questions as they arose and maintained an 
appropriate pace to complete the scenario in the allotted 
time.  All participants were actively engaged when their 
expertise or knowledge was needed. 
 
¶6. (SBU) D. The Consulate staff feels that the training was 
useful and with the training personnel has made assessments 
on how to react in a real crisis.  The Marine House wil be 
activated as the Alternate Command Center (AC).  Post EAP is 
due to be renewed in April 2008. CEPA training was held on 
January 23, 2008.  CEA will allow all sections access to 
read and updte the unclassified EAP online.  Post did take 
nte that all sections should participate in updatingtheir 
section of the EAP and that the current tripwires need to be 
reviewed and updated mission wide.  The consulate staff 
learned many lessons which highlighted certain improvements 
that post will now work to remedy.  The Avian Flu tripwires 
will be updated, in coordination with Embassy Brasilia, and 
the procedures on Tamiflu distribution will be evaluated. 
The new Marine House will be made ready to serve as an 
alternate command post with the addition of sufficient 
supplies and computer lines to serve all necessary entities 
at post during an emergency and to allow access to the newly 
created "portals" that have been established.  The Consular 
Section and RSO will refine a protocol to disperse all 
waiting visa applicants in case of emergency. 
 
¶7. (SBU) F. Post feels that the addition of the Portals on 
the internet are a great new asset to assist with 
communication and the sharing of information during a real 
crisis situation.  Technical problems did arise with the 
portals but were fixed shortly after the training session. 
Tripwires will be updated with input from posts mission wide. 
 All section heads will review Emergency Action Committee 
(EAC) roles with their staffs.  Post will reconvene its Avian 
Flu Working Group, which will coordinate with the Embassy 
Avian Flu Working Group. 
 
¶8. (U) G. Post feels that the current schedule of CME 
training, once every two years, is appropriate.  Most mid and 
upper-level officers serve three or four years in Sao Paulo. 
The current schedule allows for more recent arrivals to 
undergo training, building on the previous training given to 
officers of longer tenure.  Post RSO will contact CM when new 
threat and crime trends develop prior to the next visit, so 
that new scenarios can be added to upcoming training 
sessions.

¶9. (U) H. Post felt it was helpful to get input from the 
Consulate Staff in order to create the scenarios for the 
exercise.  Post recommends that funding be provided to send 
one or more consulate staff (American and FSN) to the Foreign 
Service Institute for advanced crisis management training.  A 
likely candidate could be an American employee newly arrived 
at post assigned to a three year tour and/or an FSN of 
long-standing tenure (5-7 years) who has shown leadership 
potential.
