"Bio-protectionism" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo 
(12/17) editorialized: "In one of the many unproductive dialogues in 
Bali, the US and the European Union presented a list of 
environmental products, such as solar and wind energy equipment, 
whose importation tariffs should be lowered.  Brazilian foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim was right to protest against the exclusion of 
bio-fuels such as ethanol and bio-diesel from the list.... One 
should not expect that the EU and the US, which impose a 63 percent 
tariff on imports of Brazilian ethanol, would give up protecting 
their inefficient bio-fuels production.... Although the 
protectionist nature of the measure is obvious, it would be 
innocuous to protest it. Social and environmental clauses are today 
an irreversible trend in the international commodities market. To 
fight them would place Brazil in the unsustainable position of 
supporting the destruction of ecosystems on behalf of production, or 
worse, on behalf of degrading labor conditions.... Something similar 
can be said about the bio-protectionist measure being prepared in 
Europe against imports of Brazilian beef... The allegation is 
protectionist, of course, but it is also a fact that Brazil is still 
far away from establishing a good sanitary control system of its 
herds.  Trade and environmental inconsistencies of both the US and 
the EU should not be an excuse for Brazil to ignore its ecological 
and sanitary deficiencies."
