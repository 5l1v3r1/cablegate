¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: Brazil's two stock exchanges announced their intent 
to merge on March 27.  The merger of the Brazilian stock exchange 
(Bovespa) and the Commodities and Futures Exchange (BM&F) into BM&F 
Bovespa, S.A. will make the new exchange the third largest in the 
world in terms of market value.  The merger should bring down 
administrative and transaction costs and allow the combined company 
to trade in a broader range of products and to compete more 
effectively with global exchanges such as NYSE-Euronext.  The merger 
should also further consolidate Brazil's position as an important 
emerging market economy and strengthen its financial system.  Post 
has good relations with both BM&F's CEO Manoel Felix Cintra Neto and 
Bovespa's Chairman Raymundo Magliano Filho, the two frontrunners to 
lead the combined BM&F Bovespa.  END SUMMARY. 
 
The Merger 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (U) On March 27, Brazil's two stock exchanges, Bovespa and the 
Commodities and Futures Exchange (BM&F), announced their merger into 
what will be called BM&F Bovespa.  The announcement follows their 
initial statement of merger talks on February 19 (ref A), and came 
well before their self-imposed 60 day deadline.  Last year, both 
companies held initial public offerings (IPO), and their exchanges 
had record-breaking years.  Bovespa Holding raised USD 3.8 billion 
in October (ref B), which was the largest IPO in Brazil's history. 
One month later, BM&F raised USD 3.4 billion.  The merger will make 
the new exchange the third largest in the world in terms of market 
value, with an estimated combined value of USD 20 billion, behind 
only the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group/New York Mercantile 
Exchange (USD 36 billion) and Germany's Deutsche Borse (USD 32 
billion). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Bovespa's CEO and Director of Investor Relations Gilberto 
Mifano told the Consul General that the two companies will retain 
their separate brand names under one umbrella holding to be called 
BM&F Bovespa.  (Note: Earlier press reports suggested the company 
would be called Nova Bolsa, or New Exchange in Portuguese.  End 
Note.)  On May 8 the majority shareholders will elect one Chairman, 
likely either BM&F's Manuel Felix Cintra Neto or Bovespa's Chairman 
of the Board of Directors, Raymundo Magliano Filho.  Cintra Neto 
told Econoffs that he would return to his banking business if he was 
not chosen to lead the combined entity, but opined that should he be 
appointed, he would like for Magliano to stay at the company, 
particularly in light of his expertise in corporate social 
responsibility. 
 
Leveraging Lessons Learned and Existing Partnerships 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) BM&F Bovespa, the fourth such merger of exchanges in 
recent history, is taking advantage of lessons learned.  In October 
2007, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group (CME) purchased 10 
percent of BM&F in exchange for two percent of the CME.  Cintra Neto 
noted to Econoffs that the CME has provided integral support to BM&F 
as it undergoes the merger.  Cintra Neto stated that there are 
currently 10 to 12 BM&F staffers at CME, and that these ongoing 
personnel exchanges will facilitate the merger. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Cintra Neto also told Econoffs that, unlike the recent 
mergers of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with Euronext and the 
CME's merger with the New York Mercantile Exchange, BM&F Bovespa 
intends to integrate the two companies' administrative functions 
where possible, including eliminating one CEO.  Cintra Neto 
criticized similar mergers for not leveraging synergies to reduce 
costs.  Cintra Neto further stated to Econoffs that the BM&F Bovespa 
union should be a more seamless merger.  Unlike NYSE and Euronext, 
for example, BM&F and Bovespa have overlapping clients and 
shareholders, a common language and business culture, and are 
physically located across the street from each other, all of which 
should facilitate an earnest integration of the two companies.

Cost Cutting 
------------ 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Bovespa and BM&F executives intend to leverage existing 
synergies and eliminate administrative duplication.  BM&F Bovespa 
hopes to integrate the company's electronic trading platforms, as 
well as its clearance and settlement activities.  The two companies 
have an aggressive goal of reducing combined overhead costs by 25 
percent within three years.  Cintra Neto remarked to Econoffs that 
approximately 90 percent of costs are for either IT systems or 
payroll.  To maximize cost cutting benefits, BM&F Bovespa plans to 
slash personnel, especially in administrative and information 
technology.  Cintra Neto stated that BM&F Bovespa plans to honor 
stock option vesting commitments for all employees they dismiss. 
 
 
¶7.  (U) Bovespa's Mifano told Econoff that he anticipates a 
reduction in costs to investors as well.  The two exchanges have 
significant client overlap and BM&F Bovespa would be able to manage 
all transactions under one roof and pass these savings on to 
customers.  Although Bovespa's transaction and administrative costs 
are higher than other exchanges, Mifano noted that Bovespa is a 
vertically integrated exchange and its overall costs (about three 
percent of total daily trading volume) are on par with peer 
exchanges.  (Note: Brazil's strict transparency rules require 
Brazilian exchanges to manage clearing and settlement functions 
in-house.  Bovespa's fees include all transactions, clearing, and 
settlement costs, while traditional exchanges only levy transactions 
fees and brokers' fees tend to include clearing and settlement 
costs.  End Note.) 
 
Awaiting Approval 
----------------- 
 
¶8.  (U) The Boards of Directors of the two companies approved the 
merger on April 17 and both executives told Econoffs that the other 
approvals are forthcoming.  The Central Bank gave its informal 
blessing (but still needs to formally approve) to consolidate four 
clearance and settlement functions into one entity despite some 
misgivings about concentrating those efforts.  Similarly, Mifano 
told Econoff that the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission 
(CVM by its Portuguese acronym) also should have no problems with 
the merger as it simplifies their supervision of the two exchanges. 
Finally, the Brazilian antitrust regulator (CADE) must sign off.  As 
the two companies were never competitors, they do not anticipate 
that their merger would create an anti-monopoly backlash. 
 
BM&F's Vision for Regional Integration 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU) While the merger helps BM&F Bovespa (and by extension 
Brazil) better position itself to compete with other modern 
exchanges, both exchanges are predominately domestic and BM&F 
Bovespa is working to partner with other exchanges to increase its 
competitiveness in the global marketplace.  Cintra Neto noted that 
BM&F has always had a collegial relationship with U.S. exchanges and 
BM&F's Director of Investor Relations Joao Lauro Amaral stated that 
BM&F's agreement with CME helps link BM&F to the U.S. market.  As a 
result, the two exchanges have an order routing agreement whereby 
BM&F and CME distribute each other's derivatives products on their 
respective local markets.  Cintra Neto further explained that BM&F 
trades its Brazilian soy futures contracts on CME's exchange and is 
helping CME establish American soy futures contracts in Brazil as 
well.  Cintra Neto affirmed that BM&F had been in talks with NYSE's 
former CEO John Thain to exchange shares while holding ongoing talks 
with CME, but that a merger with Bovespa would have been impossible 
if BM&F had opted to cut a deal with the NYSE instead.  BM&F does 
have agreements with the NYSE, however, as well as with exchanges in 
Mexico, China, and Argentina.  BM&F is also an active participant in 
the Futures Industry Association in Washington and the U.S Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Cintra Neto said that BM&F is not currently interested in 
buying exchanges in the region.  Instead, he prefers the model it 
has with the CME of sharing electronic platforms and resources. 
Cintra Neto told Econoffs that BM&F is committed to helping the rest

of Latin America develop its financial systems via technology 
transfers and exchanging business "know-how."  Cintra Neto mentioned 
that despite the Argentine exchange's recent descent, it continues 
to have a strong agricultural commodities exchange in Rosario.  He 
noted that BM&F is working with the Argentines to develop 
Brazil-Argentina soy futures contracts, which BM&F hopes will 
attract Chinese investors.  (Note: BM&F acts as an intermediary 
between buyers and sellers, especially for the Chinese.  According 
to Cintra Neto, Chinese importers do not trust Latin American 
agriculture producers to deliver their merchandise and Brazilian 
producers in turn are afraid Chinese importers will not pay.  BM&F's 
futures derivates facilitate the Brazil/Argentine-Chinese 
agriculture trading.  End Note.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶11.  (SBU) BM&F Bovespa has a healthy approach to managing their 
merger, which has clearly been in process since before each 
company's IPO last year.  Both Cintra Neto and Magliano are capable 
and impressive businessmen with whom post has regular contact. 
Despite external market turbulence, both Brazilian exchanges have 
out-performed other emerging markets and the merger should further 
consolidate Brazil's position among emerging market economies and 
help strengthen Brazil's already solid financial system.  END 
COMMENT.
