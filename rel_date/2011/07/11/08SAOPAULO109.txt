¶1. "What Is Expected From Brazil" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo lead 
editorial maintained (3/5): "The Colombian invasion in Ecuador 
cannot be characterized as a casual and unmotivated act of 
aggression. The governments of Ecuador and Venezuela have clearly 
provided protection to a gang of cocaine traffickers and kidnappers 
that want to be recognized as an ideological guerrilla that fights a 
political regime that, by the way, is democratic. If the nations of 
the region decide to isolate Colombia politically and economically, 
they will be giving invaluable help to the enemies of democracy not 
only in that nation but also on the continent.... The fact is the 
FARC have been using Ecuadorian and Venezuelan territories to 
conduct their ominous business, without any opposition of the 
governments of these nations.... Rafael Correa and Hugo Chvez have 
unconcealable sympathy vis-`-vis the FARC.  They consider this 
terrorist group part of the geopolitical 'Bolivarian' project." 
 
¶2. "Priority For The Hostages" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (3/5) 
editorialized: "Contrary to what President Hugo Chvez suggested, 
the death of Raul Reyes, the number 2 in the FARC's hierarchy, 
should not be deplored.  The rebel and his fellow comrades who were 
shot by the Colombian Army on Saturday ran the risk of dying 
violently because of the type of life they chose - for decades they 
had murdered, kidnapped and challenged Colombia's legitimate power. 
The problem is that his death hampers the release of hostages kept 
by the FARC.... Therefore, it is important that the political and 
diplomatic efforts aimed at mediating an understanding between 
Bogota and Quito should not ignore the hostages' situation.... 
Unfortunately, there are reasons to fear that Colombian President 
Alvaro Uribe's commitment in the hostages' release is limited.... 
Uribe is the legitimate representative of all Colombians and the 
only one authorized to make decisions on behalf of his nation. All 
negotiations involving the hostages must be approved by Bogota. It 
is necessary, however, that the Colombian president be convinced 
that the hostages' situation deserves maximum priority." 
 
¶3. "Suspect Silence" 
 
Columnist Clovis Rossi opined in liberal, largest national 
circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (3/5): "Rafael Correa is 
demanding very clear apologies from Colombia to give up his decision 
of breaking relations with his neighbor. It is fair.  But it is also 
fair that Correa apologizes to the Colombians - more than the 
Colombian government - for having permitted the 'tour' of FARC 
hostages in Ecuador.... The fact that the Colombian Army invaded 
Ecuadorian territory is condemnable, but is it acceptable that the 
FARC adopts the same behavior?.... An armed fight against a 
legitimate government is intolerable.  To support it means to 
support all human rights violations carried out by the FARC's 
delinquents.... Inhuman treatment given to prisoners by right wing 
dictatorships is, of course, unacceptable.  But is it OK when 
carried out by leftist fellows?  Abu Ghraib is condemnable, but is 
incarceration in the jungle, with similar tortures, permitted?" 
 
¶4. "New Frontier" 
 
Columnist Melchiades Filho commented in liberal, largest national 
circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (3/5): "With the attack, the 
Colombian president ensures more US arms and money, and maybe the 
possibility to prolong his term. On the other hand, if they were 
really interested in making peace, the FARC would not release the 
hostages little by little. They wouldn't either demand as a 
precondition the total demilitarization of the Colombian region 
where they conduct their business.... Chvez is looking for a 
target.... The violation of national sovereignty has only 
legitimated Rafael Correa's discourse that Ecuador should unite and 
mobilize its neighbors against imperialistic hostility. And the US, 
which were facing tough criticism due to a series of failures in 
fighting drug trafficking, now has a new excuse to maintain a base 
in Colombia: to protect it from insane Bolivarians."
