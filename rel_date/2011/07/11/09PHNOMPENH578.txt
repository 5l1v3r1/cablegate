¶2.  (C) Ambassador took the opportunity to deliver the key points 
regarding former President Bill Clinton's recent trip to North Korea 
during a scheduled meeting with DPM and FM to discuss other topics 
(septel).  She emphasized that the effort to secure the release of 
two American journalists was strictly a private humanitarian mission 
executed on behalf of the journalists' families.  She reiterated that

not changed. 
 
¶3.  (C) Hor Namhong thanked Ambassador for her message and noted that 
he appreciated the success of the mission.  He emphasized that it was 
a "good signal for U.S relations with North Korea" and it was a step 
that would possibly be followed by renewal of the six-party talks. He 
further stressed that he would follow carefully the next steps and 
acknowledged that while the mission was in itself "a good sign," the 
North Korea government remained very unpredictable.

Clinton's mission to North Korea was a success.  He expressed his 
understanding that the mission's objectives were limited to the 
release of the two journalists, but nonetheless he was hopeful that 
it would facilitate the renewal of the six-party talks.
