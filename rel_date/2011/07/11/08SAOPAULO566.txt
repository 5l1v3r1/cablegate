John McCain, President 
 
Liberal Folha de S. Paulo's columnist Joco Pereira Coutinho 
commenting on the U.S elections says (10/21): ...John McCain will be 
the next President of the United States. ..Any newspaper states the 
obvious: McCain failed in two essential moments: the financial 
crisis and the TV debates...  Obama won the debates because 
television is image and image is power.  Obama is young, has 
speaking skills and criticizes Bush; McCain is old, physically 
limited and unfortunately linked to Bush. ...Polls should not be 
trusted and should be read with skepticism...There is a hidden 
racism that says something to the polls and another at the ballot... 
If McCain, until November 4, shows that he is the most prepared and 
experienced leader to develop the U.S. economy without an abusive 
attack to the taxpayer's pocket; and if he is able to regain the 
moderate center without alienating the legions of the Republican 
right, the whole world that has already elected Obama to the White 
House will be surprised and shocked."
