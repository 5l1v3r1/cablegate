ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO IBAMA, SENATE VOTE REMAINS 
 
REF: 07 BRASILIA 00822 
 
¶1.  The Brazilian Chamber of Deputies (lower house) voted on June 12 
in favor of the proposed reorganization of IBAMA, the Ministry of 
Environment's enforcement agency. The restructuring, first announced 
April 25 by Environment Minister Marina Silva and supported by 
President Lula, would split IBAMA into two units. 
 
¶2. The newly created Instituto Chico Mendes, would be responsible 
for IBAMA's conservation duties and for managing Brazil's two 
hundred and eighty eight units of protected areas.  It's portfolio 
would include all activities concerning sustainable use of protected 
areas, the execution of research programs and the protection, 
preservation and conservation of biodiversity. The remaining part of 
IBAMA would limit its responsibilities to authorizing, licensing and 
supervising issues related to the environment. This would include 
the execution and enforcement of environmental policies, 
authorization for the use of natural resources and the hot-button 
issue of issuing environmental licenses. 
 
¶3.  IBAMA's 6000 employees have been on strike protesting the 
restructuring since its announcement in April.  They have vowed to 
keep pressure on the Senate to reject the restructuring measure 
until the final vote on Sept 7. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT: It is widely speculated that the decision to reorganize 
was based in part on criticism, from both the media and within her 
own party, of Minister Silva's tight environmental regulation 
policies, which have put her at odds with those supporting new 
big-ticket development projects. One example is the plan to build 
two large dams at the Santo Anttnio and Jirau rapids on the Madeira 
River in the state of Rondtnia.  After two years of review, IBAMA 
still has not issued the go ahead to construct the dams. The issue 
of environmental licensing for large energy projects is likely to 
become more contentious as Brazil continues to develop. END COMMENT:
