¶1.  (U)  The June 30 edition of Isto e magazine carried a 
story titled "Secret Agreement between Brazil and Iran" which 
reported on a memorandum (text in paragraph 3 below) of 
agreement between the Brazilian Ministry of External 
Relations (MRE) and Iran aimed at promoting economic 
cooperation and trade.  The agreement was made in March 2009 
during preparations for President Ahmadinejad's potential May 
visit that was later cancelled.  Iran was represented by the 
Export Development Bank, an institution named by the Treasury 
Department in 2008 as supporting proliferation activities. 
The article reports that the contact with Iran is seen by the 
MRE as purely commercial in response to demand from Brazilian 
business to work with Iran.  MRE director for trade promotion 
Rodrigo de Azevedo Santos is quoted as saying that Brazil 
will uphold any UN sanctions.  MRE Iran desk officer Azeredo 
Santos told Poloff that the text obtained by Isto e was 
genuine but that the document had no status because it had 
not yet been signed. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Embassy Comment: This agreement is consistent with 
President Lula and Foreign Minister Amorim's approach to Iran 
of looking for engagement, supposedly as a means of gaining 
influence that could moderate Iranian behavior.  Even though 
the GOB was embarrassed by the negative reaction to the 
invitation to President Ahmedinajad earlier this year, plans 
for commercial cooperation have proceeded.  The MRE office 
responsible for the agreement was instructed to promote trade 
with Iran, not consider the political implications of the 
relationship.  While the agreement itself contains little 
more than a promise to look into future cooperation, the fact 
that it was prepared with an entity of proliferation concern 
is significant. Because the Export Development Bank is not 
named by the UN sanctions, MRE could believe it has a green 
light to move forward.  Other parts of the Brazilian 
government may not, however, share the eagerness to expand 
commercial contacts with Iran. As Isto e put it, quoting 
Salvador Raza of the Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies, 
"to have the right to make an agreement does not mean it's 
legitimate to do it."
