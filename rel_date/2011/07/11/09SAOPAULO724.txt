"The G Spot in the Obama era" 
 
 Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (12-15) by columnist Eliane 
Catanhede says: "Diplomacy is done through signs, the press and 
letters.  And after this, with visits from subordinates, ministers 
and presidents......the Assistant Secretary for the region, Arturo 
Valenzuela, yesterday was in Brasilia; Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton is on her way; Obama comes in the first quarter.  In the 
end, Lula, [Brazil's Foreign Minister] Amorim, [Brazil's Defense 
Minister] Jobim, [Lula's international affairs advisor Marco 
Aurelio] Garcia and [former Itamaraty Secretary General] Samuel 
[Pinheiro Guimaraes] may bark, but they never bite.  And the 'pit 
bull' [the United States] knows its own strength [indicating the 
GOB knows who is in charge on issues such as Honduras, Iran and 
Copenhagen]." 
 
 
 
((The title of the article is a reference to a very controversial 
and humorous remark made by President Lula when former President 
George W. Bush was in Brazil in 2007, alluding to the G-20 and the 
Doha Round Trade Talks)).
