Title- The Threat Lula Stimulates 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (8-15) states: "..... 
[The Economist] magazine [published an editorial that] emphasizes 
the dangerous benevolence .....of Brazil's regional diplomacy with 
regards to Hugo Chavez.......In the current crisis [related to the 
expansion of the U.S- Colombia deal] created by Chavez to hide the 
evidence of his armed support to the [FARC] movement, Brazil had the 
second worst reaction, ranking only behind Ecuadorian Rafael Correa, 
which has no relations with Bogota, by demanding guarantees that the 
bases will not have another aim .....It is of national interest to 
prevent a new cold war among neighbors....." 
 
Title- Welcome to the team 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (8-16) by Eliane Catanhede says: 
"Barack Obama is trying to pretend he cares for Latin American, but 
he in fact does not.  And it is time for him to do so.  Venezuela, 
Bolivia and Ecuador are recouping their anti-U.S. rhetoric under the 
pretext of the expansion of the U.S.-Colombia deal....It is in this 
context that Mexico's President visits Brazil.....[a country] 
without enemies . . .  that is the door for Mexico to enter into a 
place it should have never left....."
