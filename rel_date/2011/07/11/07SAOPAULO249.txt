"Chvez Advances To Create His Power Machine" 
 
Business-oriented Valor Economico (3/27) editorialized: "Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chvez's project for his 21st Century Socialism 
advanced two steps over the weekend. The first was the creation of 
Venezuela's United Socialist Party (PSUV), a political group that 
will monopolize political actions carried out by Chvez's 
unconditional followers, who want the establishment of a 
dictatorship.... The second was the intensification of the land 
reform project, with the expropriation of 330,000 hectare of land 
considered unproductive.... Chvez enjoys immense popular support to 
carry out such actions, which are also the result of an 
irresponsible elite and politicians without vision. The future 
course of his government seems to be clear.  Supported by democratic 
institutions, Chvez has already advanced and accumulated powers in 
a first stage. The second stage will be the dictatorship of a 
caudillo."
