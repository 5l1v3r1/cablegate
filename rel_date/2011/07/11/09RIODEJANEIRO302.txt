SUBJECT: Rio Radar - Weeks of September 4 and 11, 2009 
 
¶1. (U) Rio Radar is a weekly compilation of key economic, political, 
commercial, and other developments in the states of Rio de Janeiro, 
Bahia, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, and Sergipe.  This report's 
subjects: 
 
NARCO-TRAFFICKING GANGS ATTACK POLICE IN SALVADOR 
 
¶2. (U) On September 7, narco-trafficking gangs launched a series of 
coordinated attacks against military police targets in Salvador, 
capital of Bahia state, in retaliation for the transfer of Claudio 
Eduardo Campnaha - an arrested drug kingpin - to a federal prison in 
Mato Grosso do Sul.  A Bahia state military police captain told us 
on September 9 that since the violence began, gangs had opened 
gunfire on eight police booths and incinerated six buses, wounding 
at least nine persons.  According to the official, the police closed 
all police booths, reinforced mobile patrols throughout the city, 
and launched offensive operations against the gangs, leading to 10 
arrests and six gang members killed.  According to a State Deputy 
from Bahia, however, the police actions have failed to halt the 
violence, with another bus incineration on September 9. 
 
MULTIPLE WELLS IN PRE-SALT AREA COME UP DRY 
 
¶3. (U) The BG Group, UK's third largest natural gas producer 
announced on August 25 that a pre-salt well drilled in partnership 
with Petrobras at BM-S-52 block in Santos Basin resulted in no 
hydrocarbon finds.  In July, an Exxon Mobile exploration also came 
up dry in another pre-salt well in the Santos Basin.  On August 26, 
Sao Paulo-based newspaper Estado reported that Petrobras had failed 
to find oil at another pre-salt well, BM-S-17.  Rio de Janeiro-based 
energy analysts disputed the report, however, arguing there was 
evidence that Petrobras rigs remained operational in BM-S-17, and 
speculating the press was attempting to demonstrate there still 
exists exploration risk in the pre-salt area through reports 
published during the lead up to the Brazilian government's 
announcement of the pre-salt regulatory framework on August 31. 
 
RIO TO LEGALIZE SHOPS WITHIN FAVELAS 
 
¶4. (U) The Mayor's Office of Rio de Janeiro has launched a pilot 
program to legitimize retail business inside seven major favelas. 
The program, called Choque de Legalidade (Legal Impact), first 
implemented in July in the Rio das Pedras favela, aims to license 
heretofore illegal stores and shops.  Rio de Janeiro's municipal 
Special Secretariat for Public Organization will set up mobile units 
in favelas to issue business licenses to commercial ventures within 
the communities.  The seven favelas include Rocinha, Santa Marta, 
Chapeu Mangueira, Babilonia, Terreirco, Jardim do Batan and Complexo 
do Alemco. 
 
RIO'S RATE OF IDLE PRISONERS HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY 
 
¶5. (U) Elionaldo Fernandes Juliao, a professor from the University 
of Rio de Janeiro, reported this week that only 7.29 percent of the 
22,606 prisoners incarcerated in the 44 prisons of Rio de Janeiro 
state are working or studying, constituting the highest percentage 
of idle prisoners in Brazil.  The national average is 24 percent. 
According to Fernandes, this lack of productive activity leads to 
criminal activity within the prison, such as using mobile phones to 
place fake kidnapping and ransom calls to victims, as well as 
planning acts of violence. 
 
PETROBRAS MOST PROFITABLE NON-FINANCIAL COMPANY IN THE WESTERN 
HEMISPHERE IN SECOND QUARTER 2009 
 
¶6. (U) According to Rio-based consulting firm Economatica, Petrobras 
was the most profitable non-financial services company in the 
Western Hemisphere between April and June 2009, with 3.9 billion USD 
in net revenue.  Citibank came in first overall, with 4.3 billion 
USD in net revenue.  Petrobras was the only Brazilian company to 
make the top 10 of the Economatica ranking.
