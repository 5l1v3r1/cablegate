REF:  06 BRASILIA 2686 
 
¶1.  At the December 13, 2006, U.S.-Brazil Common Agenda for the 
Environment (CAE) it was agreed that a Technical Work Group be 
created under the CAE framework to review and coordinate 
technical-level cooperation.  This work group could meet at any time 
but would report its work and seek policy guidance from CAE 
principals. This format would allow bilateral technical efforts to 
move forward within the ambit of CAE political considerations, but 
without hindering progress on the ground. Minister Luiz Figueiredo, 
Chief of the Environment Division of Itamaraty and head of the 
Brazilian delegation at the CAE suggested the first meeting be held 
in early 2007. 
 
¶2.  Post is ready to approach the Brazilians to get started on the 
formation of this group.  Our thinking is that initially and small 
core group (3-4) from each side could meet to launch, bringing in 
others down the road where needed.  Since the role of this committee 
is to review proposals for bilateral cooperation, proposed projects 
could be circulated electronically for comment. 
 
¶3.  In light of limited travel resources, Post suggests that the 
first meeting of the Technical Work Group be virtual, utilizing the 
U.S. Embassy Brasilia Digital Video Conference (DVC) facilities 
linked to the Bureau in Washington.  With Department concurrence, 
Post would like to propose to the Brazilians that the first 
(virtual) meeting of the Technical Work Group take place the 
beginning of March. 
 
¶4.  Post will need to present to the Technical Work Group a summary 
of proposed bilateral collaborations for their review. In 
preparation, Post is working with Brazil's Ministry of the 
Environment (MMA) to flesh out further detail of their original 
requests for technical assistance, initially outlined in Reftel (a). 
 Of the five areas listed, we have chosen three.  We are preparing 
two-page briefs with additional specifics relating to the requests 
for technical assistance on water, the establishment and management 
of parks and chemicals. 
 
¶5.  In our communications with the Ministry, we reiterate that we 
are developing an outline for technical assistance without the 
commitment of funds to support these activities.  Once a framework 
is developed, however, sources of funding may become available from 
a variety of entities, including the Brazilians themselves.
