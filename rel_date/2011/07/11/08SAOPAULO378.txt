Doha and Globalization 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (07/16) says: "The 
governments will give an ominous sign all over the world if Doha 
Round trade negotiations are hindered in a new impasse, adverted WTO 
director general Pascal Lamy...The globalization will not stop.  The 
process will continue, moved by factors such as technological 
innovation, political changes and business practices in evolution. 
Probably the result will be better if the trade integration follows 
in an orderly way... Emerging economies, Brazil included, are on the 
list of major beneficiaries of the international economic 
integration.  The Brazilian government knows that and bet many cards 
on the success of the multilateral negotiation. The new cards put on 
the table...are more acceptable than the previous ones in several 
aspects. But they still have traps, such as the possibility of 
increasing the list of agricultural products "sensitive" and 
subject to protectionism. Brazilian negotiators must dedicate good 
part of their efforts to try to eliminate these traps. If they 
succeed  there will be good possibilities of an agreement on 
agricultural and industrial market access.   WTO technicians showed 
uneasiness before the international crisis capable of noticeably 
reducing the trade growth.  Another good reason, according to them, 
to conclude the Doha Round and create grounds for a new phase of 
global prosperity."
