SUBJECT: AN AMENDED FOREST CONCESSIONS BILL PASSES THROUGH BRAZIL'S 
SENATE 
 
REF: 05 BRASILIA 2426 
 
¶1. Summary: Brazil's Forest Concessions Bill (reftel) was approved 
by the Senate on Wednesday, February 2.  However, three amendments 
were added to the bill.  Accordingly, the bill must now return to 
the Chamber of Deputies (Brazilian House of Representatives) for a 
second vetting.  If passed, the legislation would establish 
guidelines for managing public forests, create a National Forest 
Service and set up a National Forest Development Fund (PNDF). End 
Summary 
 
¶2. In the wake of political infighting, the government closed an 
accord with opposition leaders to break a deadlock and bring a 
modified bill to the floor vote on Wednesday.  Of the three newly 
incorporated amendments, the first insures that Congress has final 
authority to approve concessions over 6250 acres, the second that 
the Senate confirms the appointed directors of the newly created 
forest service and the third stipulates that the executive council 
overseeing forest service and PNDF be comprised of seven ministries, 
among which are the Ministries of Science and Technology, 
Agriculture and Defense, as opposed to just the Ministry of 
Environment. 
 
¶3. For the ruling party, and those in favor of the bill, the 
amendments represent another obstacle to forest management.  But, 
proponents of the bill agreed to support the amendments on a promise 
from that the opposition would push for an immediate vote on the 
bill when it reaches the Chamber of Deputies.  The Chamber has 10 
days from Wednesday to appraise and vote anew on the bill. 
 
¶4.  Comment: The outcome of yesterday's vote is complex.  Although 
positive on the surface, environmentalists worry that the new 
amendments unnecessarily politicize forest management.  Compounding 
these concerns, if the Chamber further modifies the bill, sending it 
back to the Senate, there is worry that insufficient time exists to 
pass the bill prior to the election year slowdown.  Fernando Lyrio 
of the Ministry of the Environment told Scicon that while the 
Ministry is concerned by the amendments it is pleased with the 
bill's passage.  Post will provide additional updates as events 
develop. End Comment
