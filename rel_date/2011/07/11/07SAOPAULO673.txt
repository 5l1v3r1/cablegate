"The US Between Containment And Aggression Against Iran" 
 
Foreign Policy analyst Newton Carlos commented in liberal, largest 
national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (8/9): "Under Secretary 
of State Nicholas Burns told a Senate committee that Iran represents 
today what Moscow was in the Cold War - the main challenge to the 
Western world's interests, especially those of the US. The same 
strategy that defeated and destroyed the former USSR, the 
containment policy, should be adopted [he said], with the use of 
heavy diplomacy such as military threats like the sending of a 
second aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf.... The containment 
policy could extend its limits, but its essence, as was the case of 
the USSR, is to reach goals through pressure and intimidation.... 
Secstate Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have 
conducted the establishment of an anti-Iran front by joining 
moderate Arab nations to Israel. Promises of billions of dollars in 
weapons are part of the strategy.... But, what will happen if the 
containment fails to isolate Iran and stop the expansion of its 
influence and its nuclear ambitions?  One of the hypotheses is that 
the way would then be opened for [VP] Cheney's group, which includes 
Elliot Abrams, who was involved in the conflicts in Central America 
in the 80's and is now a member of the National Security Council."
