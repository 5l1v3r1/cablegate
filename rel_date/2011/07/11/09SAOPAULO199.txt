SUBJECT:  B2 VISA VALIDATION STUDY GIVES POSITIVE RESULT 
 
REF: 08 SAO PAULO 575 
 
¶1. Summary:  A recent study of 2,386 B2 non-immigrant visas (NIV) 
issued at Consulate General Sao Paulo during July 2008 indicated 
that, of those who have already traveled to the United States, only 
two percent were overstays.  The results demonstrate that the 
current fraud prevention training for adjudicating officers is 
sufficient to avoid visa issuance to mala-fide travelers, and did 
not indicate any instance of organized fraud.  End Summary. 
 
Methodology 
 
¶2. During the week of July 14, 2008, Consulate General Sao Paulo 
processed 2,509 applications for B2 non-immigrant visas.  The 
approval rate on these applications was 95.1 percent.  The Fraud 
Prevention Unit (FPU) extracted data on applications from the 
Consular Consolidated Database using the AdHoc Reporting Template. 
The sample parameters were B2 visas issued during the week of July 
14, 2008.  Using these criteria, FPU pulled 2,386 issuances and 
entered them in an Excel Spreadsheet.  The 2,386 applications were 
randomly sorted and 198 were selected using a sample interval of 12. 
 Based on the "Warsaw FPU Sample Size Calculator," a sample size of 
198 would yield a standard error rate of less than three percent at 
a 95 percent confidence level, using a five percent estimated fraud 
rate. 
 
¶3. FPU ran each of the 198 selected applications against the 
Department of Homeland Security's Arrival-Departure Information 
System to determine whether and/or when the individual had traveled 
to the United States.  Of the 198 issuances, 125 (63.1 percent) were 
determined to have traveled and returned, 70 (35.4 percent) were 
determined not to have traveled, and three (1.5 percent) were 
indicated as having entered and not yet left the United States.  Of 
the three in the United States, one had traveled two months earlier 
and was still under valid B2 status.  FPU then conducted phone 
checks on the two remaining individuals to examine whether there had 
been fraud in the application such as to suggest they were unlikely 
to return. 
 
Results 
 
¶4. Results of the phone checks indicated one of the individuals had 
provided false employment and residence information.  The other 
applicant provided accurate information but misrepresented her 
intentions.  This second individual stated she was taking her 
seven-year old daughter (who was granted a visa during the same 
interview) on a ten-day trip to Disney.  After receiving the visa, 
she apparently closed her business and moved to the United States 
with her daughter. 
 
¶5. Comment:  Given the margin of error, the two percent overstay 
rate found in the study is statistically identical to that found in 
the last similar study in October 2008, which found a three percent 
rate (reftel).  FPU was unable to identify an instance of organized 
fraud.  Post believes this data indicates the NIV unit is adequately 
training its adjudicating officers to identify most types of visa 
fraud and properly apply Section 214(b) of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Act to standard B2 cases.  End Comment.
