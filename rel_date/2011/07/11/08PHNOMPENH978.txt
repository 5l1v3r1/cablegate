REF: STATE 127423 
 
¶1. (U) Cambodia does not have plans for a civil nuclear program at 
this time.  Cambodia's energy infrastructure is currently very 
underdeveloped; most electricity is produced by diesel-powered 
generators.  Only about 18 percent of the population is connected to 
the electricity grid.  The Royal Government of Cambodia's (RGC) top 
energy priorities right now are:  1) pursuit of cheaper and/or 
domestic energy sources such as coal and hydropower, 2) development 
of a better national and regional grid, and 3) rural 
electrification. 
 
¶2. (U) Pol/Econ Assistant met with Tun Lean, Director General, 
General Department of Energy at the Ministry of Industry, Mines and 
Energy (MIME) on December 5.  Tun Lean welcomed any interest from 
the U.S. civil nuclear industry but cautioned that Cambodia is still 
a long way from implementing its own civil nuclear program.  He said 
that the RGC currently required training on trans-border safety 
standards and related negotiations; he said that Vietnam and 
Thailand want to build nuclear power plants near Cambodia's borders, 
and that MIME had concerns about potential impacts to Cambodia. 
 
¶3. (U) Tun Lean also said that a South Korean professor at The 
University of Battambang, Dr. Hah Chang Joo, had approached MIME 
about developing a workshop with South Korean civil nuclear program 
experts to introduce basic industry concepts but had not yet begun 
to organize the workshop.  COMMENT: Any U.S. assistance should 
similarly focus on basic education or capacity building, as 
Cambodian officials have little to no experience in the civil 
nuclear ndustry. END COMMENT.
