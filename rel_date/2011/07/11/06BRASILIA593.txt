SUBJECT: NO BRAZILIAN BROADCASTS OF AL-MANAR 
 
REF: A) STATE 44261  B) BRASILIA 0049 
 
Classified by Charge d'Affaires Patrick Linehan, reasons 1.4 (b) 
and (d). 
 
¶1. (S) Post delivered Ref A, paragraph 3 talking points to the 
Maria Luiza Lopes da Silva, the Foreign Ministry Deputy 
Coordinator for the Combat Against Illicit Transnational 
Activities, in a March 22 conversation.  Silva had no 
substantive response. 
 
¶2. (S) Alberto Milgewitz of the local Jewish community media 
monitoring organization "De Olho na Midia", told Emboff March 22 
that his organization is certain that Al-Manar television is not 
broadcast by any cable companies or open broadcasters in Brazil. 
 Post's own review of the published programming listings for 
cable companies in Sao Paulo and Foz de Iguacu did not turn up 
any listings for Al-Manar.  ORA conducted a parallel check on 
Al-Manar broadcasts, which also proved negative. 
 
¶3. (S) On the separate question of whether Amazonas satellite 
carries Al-Manar or Al-Nour, Leonardo Cubica, the marketing 
manager at the Rio de Janeiro office of Hispamar satellite 
company, a Brazilian joint venture with Spain's Hispasat, 
asserted to Emboff March 22 that neither his company's satellite 
(Amazonas-1) nor those belong to its Spanish parent, Hispasat, 
transmit Al-Manar TV or Al-Nour radio. 
 
¶4. (S) Comment: At this time, it appears that Brazilian 
television and cable networks do not re-broadcast the Al-Manar 
signal, even if they have access to it.
