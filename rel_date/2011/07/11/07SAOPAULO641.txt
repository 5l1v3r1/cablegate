SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: EUROPE: UK PRIME MINISTER BROWN'S VISIT TO 
WASHINGTON; SAO PAULO 
 
¶1. Iraqi Question May Break 'Privileged Relation'" 
 
Center-right national circulation daily O Estado de S. Paulo's Paris 
correspondent Giles Lapouge commented (7/31): "In his first visit to 
Washington, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown adopted a 
tranquilizing posture. Yes, there is a privileged relationship 
between the UK and the US. Yes, the British troops will remain in 
Iraq as long as security conditions are not assured in that nation, 
he declared.... However, Washington is aware that the British people 
hate the war initiated by Bush in Iraq.... The US also knows that 
Mark Malloch-Brown, the minister responsible for the UK foreign 
policy towards Africa, Asia and the UN, would prefer that 
'Washington and London were no longer like Siamese twins'.... Should 
one fear that the relationship between the UK and the US may be 
affected by these bad winds?  It is true that the relationship is 
undergoing tension, but it continues lively and solid. Brown, who is 
a good economist, has never disguised his admiration for free 
enterprise.... Only the common adventure in Iraq may break that 
relationship.  At the present moment, Brown seems disinclined to 
modify the situation. But the pressure of British public opinion is 
very tough. The question is how long Brown will be able to ignore 
it." 
 
¶2. "Gordon Aims At Post-Bush Washington" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo's 
correspondent in New York Denise Godoy wrote (7/31): "Brown's visit 
to the US shows, according to foreign affairs experts, that he wants 
to maintain close relations with Washington - but not with President 
George W. Bush.... There was not in the Bush-Brown press conference 
any sign of separation.... Prioritizing issues such as terrorism, 
peace between Israel and the Palestinians and climate change, Brown 
is trying to distance himself a bit from Bush and to focus on the 
US, which will have a new president in 2009."
