SUBJECT:  CAMBODIA/AI:  THREE SUSPECTED CASES TEST NEGATIVE 
FOR AVIAN INFLUENZA 
 
REF:  A. PHNOM PENH 570 
 
¶B. PHNOM PENH 583 
 
¶1.  Three persons hospitalized on March 25 with symptoms and 
exposure patterns consistent with avian influenza have all 
tested negative for the virus (ref B).  Asymptomatic 
contacts of the hospitalized individuals also tested 
negative for avian influenza.  Following extensive screening 
efforts, there have been no other confirmed cases of humans 
infected with avian influenza following the death of a three- 
year-old girl on March 21 (ref A).  No additional 
individuals are being monitored at this time. 
 
¶2.  According to the World Health Organization, 
immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) tests conducted at the 
National Animal Health and Production Investigation Centre 
(NAHPIC) on ducks from the deceased girl's village revealed 
that approximately 30% of the specimens were infected with 
avian influenza.  These findings indicate that the virus was 
circulating in the village.  There have also been rumors of 
poultry deaths in another commune in the same district in 
Kampong Speu province as the affected village.  Provincial 
Health Department and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries personnel intends to investigate. 
 
¶3. The Ministry of Health continues to maintain an active 
presence in the affected district.  Village Health 
Volunteers are leading training on recognizing the signs and 
symptoms of avian influenza and knowing who to contact if a 
possible avian influenza case is identified.  The Minister 
for Health, Dr. Nuth Sokhom, attended the opening of one of 
the training sessions in order to demonstrate the 
government's commitment.  Posters warning about the dangers 
of handling sick/dead poultry and emphasizing the importance 
of hand washing are being printed and will be distributed in 
the affected area. 
 
¶4.  Post's CDC office will remain in close contact with the 
investigation team and is prepared to provide technical 
assistance, if requested. 
 
¶5.  COMMENT.  This incident has highlighted dramatic 
improvements in Cambodian avian influenza response 
capability in the last year.  As opposed to last year when 
the RGC had to scramble to respond to reported cases, once 
this case was identified, Ministry of Health, World Health 
Organization, and Pasteur Institute staff worked together to 
quickly identify and test 43 community contacts and 17 
healthcare contacts.  The Pasteur Institute tested specimens 
from all contacts locally using polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) testing and made results available within days.  The 
Ministry of Health, World Health Organization, and UNICEF 
quickly mounted an education campaign.  On the other hand, 
communication has been difficult as some investigation team 
members are overwhelmed with both work and inquiries and 
have been difficult to reach by phone or email.  At times, 
press leaks have gotten ahead of official dissemination of 
information.  END COMMENT.
