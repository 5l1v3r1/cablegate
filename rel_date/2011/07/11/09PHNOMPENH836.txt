¶1. This is an action cable. See Paragraph Six. 
 
¶2. Reftel is guidance for screening nominees for U.S.-sponsored 
training programs. 
 
¶3. To comply with Leahy amendment relatives to U.S.-sponsored 
security assistance training, the U.S. Embassy Phnom Penh has 
conducted local human rights vetting for the following unit to 
participate in on-going training provided by the U.S. Pacific 
Command Augmentation Team (PAT) in Cambodia. 
 
UNIT NAME: National Counter-Terrorism Special Force 
COMMANDER: Hun, Manet (Male) 
DPOB: October 20, 1977; Kampong Cham 
POSITION: Commander 
RANK: Brigadier General 
DEPT/UNIT: National Counter-Terrorism Special Force 
 
¶4. The National Counter-Terrorism Special Force (NCTSF) was created 
in 2008 under the command of Brigadier General Hun Manet.  Members 
of the new unit were selected from several existing units of the 
Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, including some individuals with prior 
service in Brigade 70 or the Prime Minister's Bodyguard Unit, in 
differing periods from 1998 to the recent past.  However, none of 
the members of the NCTSF served with B-70 or the Prime Minister's 
Bodyguard Unit prior to 31 December 1997.  All members of the NCTSF 
have been individually vetted by Post and the Department at least 
one time, with no derogatory information found.  U.S. Embassy Phnom 
Penh has reviewed its files and finds that, as of this date, it 
possesses no credible information of gross violations of human 
rights by the above unit. 
 
¶5. Individuals in this unit will participate in on-going training 
over the period of one year provided by the U.S. Pacific Command 
Augmentation Team (PAT) in Cambodia, from not later than November 
30, 2009. 
 
¶6. Action request: Please verify whether the Department possesses 
any credible information that the unit named above has been 
implicated in gross violations of human rights.
