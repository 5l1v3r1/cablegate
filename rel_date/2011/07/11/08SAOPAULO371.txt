¶1. Decisive Game in Geneva 
 
 Lead editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (07/14) 
comments: "The most influential trade negotiators will meet in 
Geneva within a week to try to save the Doha Round before the new 
U.S. president takes office. ... The positions never were so close, 
and yet, it is still necessary to eliminate important differences on 
market access conditions. ... There will be a tough game, in Geneva, 
during the week of the 21st. The European representative, Peter 
Mandelson, will be pressured by protectionist interests, especially 
defended by the French government.  U.S. representative Susan Schwab 
will speak on behalf of a government at the end of its term.  Among 
the developing nations there are still important differences.  But 
the game is too important fatalistically to accept a new failure." 
 
 
¶2. Cherry without a Cake 
 
In an opinion article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (07/14)  former 
Brazilian Environmental Minister Marina Silva opines: "The 
international trade rounds on global warming, with some exceptions, 
became a routine of failures or near-failures that, far from causing 
discomfort, seem to be a calculated strategy to postpone 
responsibilities. ... The intractable position of the rich countries 
serves as a shield for the inertia of other countries, which 
sometimes give excellent speeches, but seem to rely on the disaccord 
of the "big" countries in order not to have to move beyond that."
