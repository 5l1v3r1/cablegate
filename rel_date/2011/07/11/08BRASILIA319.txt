¶2.  (SBU) On February 27, 2008, Environment, Science, Technology and 
Health (ESTH) Counselor met with the Deputy Director of the Ministry 
of External Relations' Department of Disarmament and Sensitive 
Technologies, Counselor Luiz Fernando Abbott Galvao, to discuss the 
USG views on the February 22 report by the Director General of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Iran and the February 
25 follow up briefing by IAEA Deputy Director General for Safeguards 
Olli Heinonen.  ESTH Counselor provided the non-papers contained in 
REFTELS A and B. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Galvao thanked the USG for sharing its views.  He was 
well-informed about the report.  He commented that the Government of 
Brazil (GOB) saw signs of progress in the IAEA's recent report on 
Iran with various outstanding matters being resolved.  However, the 
GOB was concerned because Iran had not come clean.  He said that the 
GOB recognized Iran needed to clarify some key points, including its 
activities regarding missiles and warheads.
