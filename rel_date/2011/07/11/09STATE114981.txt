¶1.  (C/NF)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS WISH TO EXTEND THANKS TO ALL 
POSTS IN BRAZIL FOR RECENT HIGH-CALIBER REPORTING ON UPCOMING 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN BRAZIL, INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE 
ASSESSMENTS OF CIRO GOMES AND AECIO NEVES. WE APPRECIATED 
DETAILS OF NEVES'S LIKELY PLATFORM, SHOULD HE ULTIMATELY RUN 
FOR PRESIDENT IN EITHER 2010 OR 2014, AND DETAILS OF HIS 
PROBABLE INTERIM STRATEGY, SHOULD JOSE SERRA BECOME THE 
BRAZILIAN SOCIAL DEMOCRACY PARTY (PSDB) NOMINEE IN 2010. NEW 
INFORMATION ABOUT CIRO GOMES'S ELECTORAL STRATEGY--INCLUDING 
LULA ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS TO USE HIS CANDIDACY TO BENEFIT 
THE CAMPAIGN OF DILMA ROUSSEFF--WAS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE, 
GIVEN GOMES'S RISE IN POLLS RELATIVE TO ROUSSEFF. WE ALSO 
APPRECIATED THE ASSESSMENT OF THE LOOMING GOVERNANCE PROBLEM 
LIKELY TO EMERGE IN APRIL 2010 WHEN CANDIDATES RESIGN FROM 
GOVERNMENT POSTS IN ORDER TO CAMPAIGN, AND WE WELCOMED 
PRIVATE CONSULTANTS' ASSESSMENTS OF THE ELECTORAL PROSPECTS 
FOR SERRA AND ROUSSEFF. WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE INSIGHTS FROM 
THESE CABLES IN LEADERSHIP PRODUCTS, BRIEFINGS, CURRENT AND 
LONG-TERM ELECTION PRODUCTION DURING THE COMING MONTHS. 
SENIOR NSC OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN BRAZIL'S 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, EVEN AT THIS EARLY STAGE.  MANY 
THANKS, AND REGARDS FROM WASHINGTON. 
CLINTON
