¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  According to Petrobras, the company will 
complete all of its existing contractual requirements in Iran later 
this year.  After completion of the Tusan contract, Petrobras does 
not expect to be further invested in oil and gas activities in Iran. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In 2004, Petrobras concluded a $34 million four-year 
contract with Iran to explore the Tusan block, one of eight offshore 
tracts offered in early 2003 covering most of Iran's waters between 
the port of Bushehr and the Strait of Hormuz.  This marked 
Petrobras' return to Iran; Petrobras had discovered more than 10 
billion barrels of oil there before the 1979 Islamic revolution 
ended foreign E&P investment in Iran.  Under the terms of the Tusan 
deal, Petrobras is committed to drill two wells and then return the 
field to Iran.  If oil is found, then Petrobras will get its 
investment back plus a fee.  According to Homero Ventur, Petrobras' 
General Manager for Asset Development (Note: Ventur has primary 
responsibility for Petrobras' activities in Eurasia), drilling of 
the first well is already complete and drilling of the second well 
is expected to finish by October.  After the Tusan contract is 
fulfilled, Petrobras does not plan to pursue any further deals with 
Iran. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Ventur confirmed that negotiations with Iran's Khazar Oil 
Exploration and Production Company for drilling rights in the 
Caspian Sea have stalled and that Petrobras is no longer actively 
pursuing the deal.  He called Iranian press reports last year that 
the deal was ready for signature "over-exaggerated." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment: Although we have previously heard Petrobras' 
complaints about the difficulty of doing business in Iran, Ventur's 
comments are the first definitive answer we have received regarding 
the status of the Caspian Sea deal with Iran.  Ventur was very frank 
in discussing Petrobras' activities with Iran, and was keenly aware 
of U.S. political interest on the issue.  End Comment. 
 
¶5.  (U) This message was cleared/coordinated with Embassy Brasilia.
