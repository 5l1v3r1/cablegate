"Drugs, the Real Enemy" 
 
 
 
Article in circulation leader and liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-14) 
by Clovis Rossi states: "If Brazil really wants to help Colombia 
and Venezuela reach an understanding for joint surveillance of 
their borders....[Brazil] has to begin to understand clearly what 
is happening in the border areas.....The problem of the 
Colombia-Venezuela border is not military or diplomatic.  It is one 
of delinquency.... [and] the problem in Colombia is not just 
internal.  Drug trafficking is only less globalized than financial 
transactions.  It is not going to be solved without coordinated 
action at least in the regional arena, the only area where Brazil 
may have a leadership role.....The war threats that Chavez has 
directed against Colombia......is a choice made against the wrong 
target.....The enemy is not U.S. bases in Colombia, but the 
uncounted bases - and soldiers - of the drug traffickers in all 
Latin American countries."
