SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION O GLOBO, THE GREEN REVOLUTION IN IRAN 
 
Article Title: "More Pressure" 
On June 18, 2009, center-right national daily O Globo writes, "In 
the month of June, twenty years ago, the image of the man in the 
white shirt in Beijing who blocked the tank's path in Tiananmen 
Square, became a symbol of the massacre of those who fought for 
democracy in China. Today in Iran, after five days of massive 
protests by what could be called "the green revolution" (the color 
of Islam, also the campaign color of the defeated opposition 
candidate), the ayatollahs' regime has done everything it can to 
impede the internal and external transmission of reports, photos, 
images, and any other type of information concerning the largest 
protest since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. 
 
[All of these efforts have been] in vain. The moderate forces that 
struggle to reform the regime and support Mir-Houssein Moussavi make 
use of what New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman calls the 
"virtual mosque": social networks, blogs, Twitter, and other modern 
means that serve as a meeting place for planning, informing, and 
mobilizing party members, bypassing the growing restrictions on 
liberty-all examples of how new technology challenges authoritarian 
regimes. The manifestations are spreading throughout the country. 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic who 
endorsed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's victory, made an about-face 
and called far a partial recount of the votes-a move whose 
effectiveness is doubtful. The suspicion of fraud is reinforced by 
the unusual speed with which Ahmadinejad was declared the winner and 
by the fact that Moussavi and other opposition candidates lost-by 
wide margins-in their own home provinces according to official 
estimates. 
 
The forces unlocked by the rejection of the election results created 
a conflict within the theocratic power nucleus of Iran. Important 
fissures are revealing themselves among the clerics: Moussavi has 
the support of heavy-weights like Ayatollah Rafsanjani, former 
President of the Republic and the leader of the Assembly of Experts, 
the only government body with the power to choose the Supreme 
Leader. The government is trying to avoid a large, bloody 
confrontation with the protestors, even though many of them have 
already been killed. It is possible to think that the movement will 
lead to a relaxing of the regime and an opening for the West- even 
if not right away."
