¶1.  (SBU) On January 28, ESTH Counselor briefed the Director of the 
Brazilian Ministry of External Relations' (MRE) Environment 
Division, Fernando Coimbra, about the new U.S import regulation for 
Caribbean Spiny Lobster (REFTEL).  Coimbra said that the Brazilian 
Government also was concerned about the problem of predatory fishing 
of spiny lobster.  He added that they were now considering 
increasing the protection for the spiny lobster by listing the spiny 
lobster on Annex III of the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES).  Coimbra appreciated the USG taking this 
new import measure to protect the spiny lobster.  It would make it 
easier for the Brazilian Government to be stricter on catching spiny 
lobster because it would not be a Brazilian unilateral measure, he 
explained.  Importantly, Coimbra added, this new regulation would 
not put Brazilian fishermen at a disadvantage compared with those 
from other spiny lobster exporting countries. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Later that day, ESTH briefed the Special Secretariat for 
Aquiculture and Fishing's (SEAP) General Coordinator for the Fishing 
Industry, Fabiano Rosa Duarte, about the new regulation.  He 
requested a complete copy of the text of the regulation, which, with 
the help of OES/OMC, Post obtained and provided to SEAP on January 
¶30. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Further, on January 30 the Post delivered to the MRE a 
diplomatic note (no. 46) with the information contained in REFTEL 
about the new import regulation.
