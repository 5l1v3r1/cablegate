¶1.  This message provides additional information on trafficking in 
persons in Brazil not previously reported in refs B, C, and D.  With 
the exception of paragraph 4, the new information was provided by 
the National Secretariat of Justice (SNJ), which has been very 
cooperative and helpful to the Mission in the completion of this 
report, unlike in 2007 and 2008, when it refused to work with us on 
the report.

¶4.  On March 4, 2009, a federal judge in, Maraba, Para state, 
convicted and sentenced 22 persons on slave labor charges, acquitted 
six on slave labor charges but convicted them of other, related 
charges, and acquitted another six defendants entirely of slave 
labor charges.  According to official statements, the six who were 
completely acquitted could not be convicted because the charges 
dated from before 2003, before the alteration of Article 149 
(Reducing a person to a condition analogous to slavery) to stipulate 
a prison sentence of greater than two years eight months.  The 
sentences handed down ranged from three years, four months, in 
prison and fine of 100 "fine-days" to ten years, six months, in 
prison and 315 "fine-days" (Note.  NFI on "fine-days," possibly 
based on minimum wage earnings.  End note.)   The defendants can 
appeal the sentences.  According to a statement on the case from the 
Federal Prosecutor's office in Para, southeastern Para is the source 
of the greatest number of slave labor cases brought to the Federal 
Public Ministry, and of the 64 cases for Article 149 violations 
brought to the Federal Public Ministry in 2008, 46 concerned workers 
freed from farms in southeastern Para.  This case is extremely 
important because it is the first instance of slave labor 
convictions in federal court that have resulted from the November 
30, 2006, Supreme Court decision that gave federal courts the 
authority to try slave labor cases. Previously they were handled in 
state courts.

Irregular Immigration, designed especially for officials who work in 
the restricted areas of the Guarulhos airport, Brazil's busiest, 
including federal police agents, phyto-sanitary inspectors, 
employees of Infraero (the airports authority), and the federal 
revenue service. In February 2007, the SNJ had provided a training 
course on the same subjects for airline employees, and federal and 
civil and police agents.  Approximately 300 persons (total) 
participated in the two courses. 
 
¶6.  According to the SNJ, the government and the University of 
Brasilia have presented a distance learning course on TIP for 600 
professionals (dates not specified).

¶8.  According to the SNJ, the government works with shelters and 
health care providers to provide assistance to victims of 
trafficking and forced labor at over 600 sites, and a network of 400 
centers work with children, including victims of commercial sexual 
exploitation and sex tourism.  The government of the state of Sao 
Paulo continues working with an NGO to assist repatriated Brazilian 
women and adolescents who were trafficking victims.  Also according 
to SNJ, the Assistance Program for Women and Adolescent Victims of 
Trafficking for Sexual Exploitation has been in continuous operation 
since October 2006 with funding from USAID, which provides it 
training, technical and financial assistance.  The program has 
developed a judicial mechanism to provide social, psychological and 
legal assistance to child and adult victims, and was developed on 
the basis of the rights guaranteed to TIP victims in the Palermo 
Protocol.  The program is being carried out in ten Brazilian cities, 
including Manaus, Sao Luis, Fortaleza, Natal, Foz do Iguacu, Rio 
Branco, Recife, Salvador, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, all chosen 
because of their high incidence of trafficking in women and 
children.

¶9.  According to the SNJ, over 20,000 Bolivians have been granted 
legal status in Brazil since the 2005 Brazil/Bolivia Migratory 
Regularization Agreement allowed them to adjust status.  The SNJ 
states that the total number of Bolivians who have benefited is 
around 60,000 because the data do not include dependents.

¶11.  According to the SNJ, a large number of NGOs with broad agendas

Vida), as well as churches, working jointly with NGOs and the 
government.
