"Leadership in question" 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-1) by Janio de Freitas 
states that: "The denial of Brazil's concerns about the U.S. 
military presence in Colombia and the recreation of the U.S. fleet 
for the South Atlantic expressed in an international interview by 
Brazil's Defense Minister Nelson Jobim is, in addition to being 
untruthful, outdated as an test of diplomacy.....From a political 
point of view, the Colombian concession implies a defeat for Lula 
and for those who started to see Brazil's leadership in South 
America...."
