SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY (IBAMA) TO TAKE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL CITES-RELATED IMPORTS AND EXPORTS 
 
¶1. SUMMARY.  In an effort to improve handling of trade in products 
covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES) the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and 
Natural Resources (IBAMA) will assume responsibility for all imports 
and exports.  Pursuant to a rule that will take effect in January 
2009, all CITES imports and exports will be restricted to a few 
major ports of entry.  This should improve compliance with U.S. 
import regulations.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  On October 15, 2008, Embassy Science Officers met with Joao 
Pessoa, the Coordinator for the Management of the Use of Fauna 
Species for the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Natural 
Resources (IBAMA.)  Pessoa said that Executive Instruction Number 
188 issued by IBAMA on September 11, 2008 designated certain 
authorized ports for all imports and exports subject to the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). 
IBAMA will place inspectors at each of these ports to carry out all 
necessary cargo inspections and enforcement activity.  The new rule 
enters into effect in January 2009 and will give inspection and 
clearance authority over these shipments to the IBAMA agents rather 
than customs officials (Receita Federal), who currently handle such 
shipments.  The goal of this change is to enhance Brazil's ability 
to meet its CITES obligations, Pessoa said.  The change will also 
allow Brazilian trade in goods subject to CITES approval to better 
comply with the U.S. requirement that a government official confirm 
the contents and quantity of goods at the time of export. 
 
¶3. The only designated international airports will be: Brasilia, 
Fortaleza, Salvador, Belem, Sao Paulo, and Porto Alegre.  The only 
seaports will be: Belem, Santos, Vitoria, Paranagua, Itajai, and 
Uruguaiana.  To date, the only airport in this group with direct 
flights to and from the United States is Sao Paulo (soon to be 
joined by Salvador). 
 
¶4.  Pessoa commented noted that the customs authorities had 
encountered difficulties in meeting the new U.S. requirement to 
certify the quantity of items being shipped.  He explained that 
while customs officials could easily tell how many containers were 
included in a shipment, they were reluctant to open them up and 
count how many specimens were inside each shipping container.  He 
attributed this reluctance in part to the lack of sufficient 
personnel.  He expected an improvement in compliance when IBAMA 
personnel took over responsibility in January.
