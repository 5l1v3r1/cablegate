¶1. Post delivered reftel's talking points to Otavio Drummond of the 
MFA's Division for Environmental Policy and Sustainable Development. 
 Drummond noted that the Ministry of Environment (MMA) is 
responsible for mercury activities in Brazil and surmised that the 
MMA would most likely submit a list of activities to UNEP.  The MFA 
has requested information from MMA which Drummond will pass on 
if/when received. 
 
¶2. Comment: Scioffs have been trying to facilitate mercury 
cooperation between the MMA and U.S. EPA under the ambit of the UNEP 
mercury partnership program.  Throughout the process the MMA 
division responsible for chemicals has often appeared unable to 
execute tasks in a timely manner.  To wit, it is not clear whether 
they will make the submission deadline for the report.  The MMA has, 
however, continually professed interest in working on mercury with 
UNEP and the USG. End Comment
