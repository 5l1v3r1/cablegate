Rio-based center-right daily O Globo writes: "While other countries 
have shown flexibility regarding the elections in Honduras, 
considering them to be a first step out of the crisis resulting 
from the June Coup d'????tat, Brazil (...) will not recognize the 
results because ousted President, Manuel Zelaya, was not restored 
to office before the elections(...) Lula reaffirmed the Brazilian 
stance that is shared by important South American countries such as 
Chile and Argentina, but is also the stance of the Bolivarian 
block, led by Venezuela. One should not forget that Zelaya intended 
to make Honduras the second Central American state of the block, 
next to Nicaragua. To Venezuela and its allies there is no interest 
in ending the impasse because it would mean giving up its hopes for 
Honduras. The elections, scheduled before the coup, became the most 
important political factor to break the impasse produced by the 
rise to power of the president of the Congress, Roberto Micheletti, 
and Zelaya's return to the country, sheltered by the Brazilian 
Embassy, from where he started to urge his followers to act against 
the interim government. (...) The U.S. recognizes the elections in 
the company of Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica and Panama. But the White 
House wants the Honduran leaders to form a national coalition 
government until the inauguration of the elected [President], 
conservative Porfirio Lobo, on January 27. Tomorrow, the Honduran 
Congress will gather to vote whether Zelaya should return to the 
presidency. If the vote is positive, Brazil will have an honorable 
way out to demonstrate pragmatism and contribute to institutional 
normalization in Honduras. A contrary decision by the Congress will 
leave Brazil in a situation that is even more difficult."  (Dec 1,
