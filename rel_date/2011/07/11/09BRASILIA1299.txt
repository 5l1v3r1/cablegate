DISCUSSION WITH BRAZILIAN GSI MINISTER FELIX 
 
REF: BRASILIA 1038 
 
(U)  THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR INTERNET 
DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Following up on the August meeting between Gary 
Samore from the National Security Council and General Jorge Felix, 
Minister of the Brazilian Cabinet for Institutional Security (GSI), 
the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration 
(NNSA), Thomas D'Agostino, had a productive telephone discussion on 
October 9 with Felix about nuclear security and non-proliferation. 
Motivated by this D'Agostino call, Felix appears inclined to visit 
the United States to pursue cooperation in the nuclear security 
area.  His staff says that he would like an invitation from a senior 
USG official responsible broadly for nuclear matters, and they 
suggested Samore.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Administrator of the National Nuclear Security 
Administration (NNSA), Thomas D'Agostino, discussed nuclear security 
and non-proliferation issues by telephone on October 9 with the 
Minister of the Brazilian Cabinet for Institutional Security (GSI), 
General Jorge Felix.  This conversation was part of the follow up to 
the August 7 meeting in Brasilia between Felix and Gary Samore of 
the National Security Council (REFTEL).  D'Agostino and Felix had a 
friendly and productive conversation, and both looked for areas 
where their two agencies could work together on nuclear matters. 
Felix explained that GSI had only recently been charged with 
coordinating the Government of Brazil's  nuclear security matters, 
and therefore many activities that might seem routine to the NNSA 
were still quite new and challenging for GSI.  Felix was grateful to 
D'Agostino and the USG for reaching out to him and he looked forward 
to building a strong and lasting cooperation between the two 
agencies. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) D'Agostino echoed Felix's strong desire for cooperation 
between their two agencies.  Both agreed that areas such as 
structures for nuclear security; responding to nuclear emergencies; 
and control of sensitive imports/exports would be excellent areas in 
which to begin their cooperation.  Felix also mentioned that the 
United States does a good job of conducting industry outreach, which 
is critical to the issue of imports/exports, and that he would like 
to learn from the USG's experience. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In addition, D'Agostino invited Felix to come to the 
United States and visit the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge 
site to hold technical discussions on nuclear security and 
international safeguards, including implementation of the Additional 
Protocol.  Following up on that call, Science Counselor and Science 
Officer met on October 22 with Felix's international advisor, Miriam 
Medeiros da Silva, to discuss possible next steps in cooperation. 
Medeiros said that Felix realized that the NNSA's portfolio did not 
match up exactly with that of GSI, and that GSI had many 
responsibilities concerning security and nuclear materials that 
corresponded more closely to those of the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) and other agencies.  While D'Agostino had created a 
strong impetus to visit the United States, Felix wanted to meet with 
other agencies as well.  Medeiros said accordingly that Felix would 
likely respond positively to an invitation from a senior official 
with a wider nuclear portfolio; she suggested an invitation from 
Gary Samore.  Furthermore, she added that Felix would very much like 
to meet with DHS Secretary Napolitano during the visit. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) D'Agostino and Felix concluded the call by agreeing to 
establish principal points of contact to begin outlining potential 
cooperative activities.  They also agreed that the U.S. Embassy in 
Brasilia should help to facilitate this dialog.  Since then Felix 
has designated Medeiros as the GSI point of contact, and the Embassy 
has delivered to Felix a December 2008 letter (D'Agostino to 
Minister of Defense Jobim and to Under Secretary Vargas of the 
Ministry of External Relations) on possible nuclear nonproliferation 
cooperation that D'Agostino mentioned during the conversation.
