Â¶1. Regivaldo Pereira Galvao, one of two ranchers accused of 
orchestrating the murder of Dorothy Stang, was granted release from 
prison on June 29.  Brazil's 1st Circuit Supreme Federal Court (STF) 
in a three-to-two vote, granted Galvao's habeas corpus request and 
ordered him immediately discharged.  This vote overturns a STF 
decision from September 2005 which denied Galvao's release on the 
grounds of public safety.  The current decision reflects the court's 
judgment that he is neither a threat to public safety or a flight 
risk.  Galvao has been in prison, awaiting trial since April 7, 
2005; although, the Para State Justice Tribunal, which will try 
Galvao, has yet to set a date for the proceedings. Members of 
Stang's family were notably upset with the verdict and decried what 
they view as an opportunity for Galvao to go into hiding and/or 
influence potential witnesses before the trial.
