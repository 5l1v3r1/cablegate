¶1. SUMMARY: Ambassador Sobel, USAID Mission Director Jennifer Adams 
and CDC Country Director Suzanne Westman met with GOB Minister of 
Health Agenor Alvares and the director of the National HIV/AIDS 
program, Mariangela Simao, to discuss the potential for expanded 
collaboration in health on September 13.  Alvares stated his 
willingness to reinitiate collaboration with USAID on those aspects 
of policy to combat HIV/AIDS where both countries agreed.  GoB 
priorities for USAID assistance on HIV AIDS are in the areas of: 
addressing mother to child transmission, a focus on people living 
with AIDS, and selected activities in research and social marketing. 
 The Ambassador and Alvares also discussed the potential for 
cooperation in an Avian Influenza early warning network, as well as 
potential for Brazilian technical assistance to Africa.  Alvares 
will be in Washington for the September 25-27 Pan American Health 
Organization (PAHO) meetings and hopes to meet with DHHS Secretary 
Leavitt.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. Ambassador Sobel, accompanied by USAID Director Jennifer Adams 
and CDC Director Suzanne Westman, met on September 13 with Minister 
of Health Agenor Alvares da Silva, who was accompanied by Santiago 
Alcazar, Head of the International Affairs Office, and Dr. 
Mariangela Batista Galvao Simao, the Director of the National 
HIV/AIDS Program.  Ambassador Sobel and Dr. Alvares discussed 
mechanisms for expanding collaboration on health issues between the 
U.S. and Brazil; and addressed specifically Brazil's interest in 
resuming USAID assistance for HIV/AIDS activities in Brazil. 
 
¶3. The Ambassador expressed his satisfaction with the long and 
productive collaboration in the health care sector between Brazil 
and the U.S.  The Minister concurred, and noted that this 
collaboration had encompassed several key public health areas, and 
involved multiple agencies.  Both the Ambassador and the Minister 
noted that last year's disagreement over HIV/AIDS policy and the 
termination of USAID's assistance program was an unfortunate 
exception.  Both he and the National HIV/AIDS Director noted that 
there continue to be areas of divergence in U.S. and Brazilian 
policy on HIV/AIDS, but that there is ample opportunity to 
collaborate on activities of mutual interest.  They suggested that 
we "agree to disagree" on issues related to abstinence and "Be 
Faithful" as a means of HIV prevention, and restrictions related to 
prostitution, and focus instead on activities related to people 
living with AIDS, mother to child transmission, research, social 
marketing and other mutually agreeable components.  Ambassador Sobel 
indicated that he would take this message to Washington, and 
specifically raise it with Mark Dybul, Director of the Office of 
Global AIDS Coordination. 
 
¶4. Ambassador Sobel and Minister Alvares also discussed a broader 
agenda of cooperation.  The Minister indicated his strong interest 
in support for Avian Influenza, including proposed assistance from 
CDC and participation in a global early warning network being 
established by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). 
He also indicated a strong interest in collaboration related to 
malaria in the Amazon, and other infectious diseases.  The Minister 
mentioned the highly developed training capacity in Brazil for 
auxiliary health workers, and its suitability for training personnel 
from other countries, along with Brazil's interest in making its 
technical expertise in health, particularly HIV/AIDS, available to 
other countries, including Lusophone Africa. 
 
¶5. Ambassador Sobel informed the Minister about the imminent arrival 
of a health fellow.  It was agreed that the health fellow would work 
with Ministry representatives to devise a longer-term agenda for 
collaboration, including university exchanges and mechanisms to 
promote greaterunderstanding of how each country's health system is 
structured and operates.  Ambassador Sobel noted his personal 
interest in corporate social responsibility and his hope that such 
efforts could be expanded in the future in support of US/Brazilian 
health projects. 
 
¶6. Minister Alvares told the Ambassador that he would travel to 
Washington (September 25-27) for meetings at PAHO.  The Ambassador 
offered to facilitate a meeting with DHHS Secretary Leavitt. 
 
¶7. On September 15, Ambassador Sobel, again accompanied by CDC and 
USAID Directors, visited the offices of the National HIV/AIDS 
Program.  Dr. Simao outlined the history of the national program, 
highlighting some specific circumstances, such as an early national 
response that included an emphasis on treatment, that characterized 
the program.  In response to the Ambassador's question, Dr. Simao 
reiterated that limited assistance in addressing mother to child 
transmission, a focus on people living with AIDS, and selected 
activities in research and social marketing would be her priorities 
for USAID assistance.  Dr. Simao concluded that any future program 
would be assured of a "relationship of mutual respect."

¶8. Comment.  Despite the tensions between USG and GOB policies on 
HIV/AIDS in the past, this is the second time in the last four 
months that the Ministry of Health has expressed its interest in 
expanding cooperation with the USG in areas of mutual interest 
(reftel).  We take this as a very positive sign and will coordinate 
with USAID and DHHS on steps for moving forward.  End Comment.
