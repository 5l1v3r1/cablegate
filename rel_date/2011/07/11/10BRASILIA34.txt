Dear Charg????, 
 
 
 
I have the honor to refer to Diplomatic Note 443, dated December 
10, 2009, of which wording in Portuguese is as follows: 
 
 
 
"Your Excellency: 
 
 
 
I have the honor to refer to the Framework Agreement between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of 
the Federative Republic of Brazil on Cooperation in the Peaceful 
Uses of Outer Space, signed at Brasilia March 1, 1996, as extended 
(hereinafter referred to as "the 1996 Agreement"). 
 
 
 
I am pleased to recognize the significant achievements in 
cooperative activities in space of the two Governments under the 
1996 Agreement, and to express the desire of the United States that 
their mutually beneficial relationship continues. 
 
 
 
Accordingly, noting that the 1996 Agreement is currently set to 
expire on January 31, 2010, I, on behalf of the Government of the 
United States of America, have the honor to propose that the 1996 
Agreement, consistent with Article 13 thereof, be extended for an 
additional two years, through January 31, 2012. 
 
 
 
I further propose that if this arrangement is acceptable to the 
Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil, this Note and your 
affirmative reply shall constitute an agreement between the two 
Governments to extend the 1996 Agreement, which shall enter into 
force on the date of your reply Note, with effect from January 31, 
¶2010. 
 
 
 
Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.

In light of the importance of the referred Agreement for the 
development of the bilateral space cooperation between Brazil and 
the United States, I have the honor to accept Your Excellency's 
proposal to extend it, and to confirm our understanding that Your 
Excellency's Diplomatic Note, together with this response Note, 
constitute the Agreement between our two Governments for the 
extension of the referenced Framework Agreement until January 31, 
2012, that will enter into force on the date of the signature of 
this Note. 
 
 
 
I take this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the expression 
of my highest consideration.
