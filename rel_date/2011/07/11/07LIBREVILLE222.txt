SUBJECT: POSSIBLE US-BRAZIL COOPERATION TO COMBAT MALARIA 
IN STP 
 
¶1. (U) During a visit to Sao Tome and Principe (STP) last 
week, Ambassador Walkley met Manuel Innocencio de Lacerdo 
Santos, Brazil's ambassador in STP, to explore possible 
US-Brazilian cooperation in the fight against malaria.  One 
focus of the conversation was an examination of Taiwan's 
anti-malaria program in STP.  FYI: STP is a two-island nation 
with a population of approximately 160,000 (154,500 on Sao 
Tome, 5,500 on Principe). 
 
¶2. (U) Taiwan started an anti-malaria program in STP in 2000, 
with a three-year series of pilot studies that indicated the 
best way to eradicate malaria would be through indoor 
residual spraying (IRS) with alphacypermethrin 50mg/m2.  The 
IRS program began in 2005, with the plan to spray virtually 
every house on the two islands once a year for three years. 
The 2005 IRS program covered 93% of the population, the 2006 
program 88% and the 2007 program so far 90%.  There will be 
no mass sprayings after 2007 (to minimize the chance of 
insecticide resistance). 
 
¶3. (U) The results have been dramatic.  In the year before 
the spraying in 2004, there were 67,000 cases of malaria 
reported, 13,000 patients hospitalized and 300 deaths.  After 
two rounds of spraying, the 2006 figures were 8,600 malaria 
cases, 1,700 hospitalized and 21 deaths.  In late 2006, blood 
tests were done on virtually everyone on Principe; of the 
5427 tests, only 57 were positive for malaria.  With the 
treatment of those 57, there is the possibility of 
eradicating malaria on Principe.  A similar mass screening of 
everyone on Sao Tome is planned for late 2007.  Taiwan has 
been spending approximately one million dollars per year on 
the STP anti-malaria program. 
 
¶4. (U) Later this year, Taiwan will send 60 people from STP 
to Taipei for training in quarantine issues and maintenance 
of the anti-malaria program. 
 
¶5. (U) Given the success of Taiwan's program in STP, are 
there areas where US-Brazilian cooperation on malaria would 
be useful and not duplicative?  Ambassadors Walkley and 
Santos are in agreement that there remain two areas where 
joint activities could be effective: the further training of 
personnel and the mapping of vectors.  We recommend that a 
small US-Brazilian team of experts be sent to STP to draw up 
a specific program.  (Santos indicates that the last 
Brazilian malaria team visit to STP was in 2004, before the 
Taiwanese began the spraying program.) 
 
6.(U) Ambassador Santos will be sending to Brasilia a cable 
with recommendations similar to the ones in this message.
