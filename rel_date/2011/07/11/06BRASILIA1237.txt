¶1. Scioff delivered reftel and talking points to Raphael Azeredo and 
Otavio Trindade of the MFA's Division for Environmental Policy and 
Sustainable Development on June 16.  Azeredo declared that the GoB, 
possessing a highly developed chemical industry, was immensely 
concerned with investing in R&D and chemical safety regulation. 
However, he also noted that excessive regulation was a worry and 
that there is "a fine line between policies that safeguard and 
policies that create unwanted trade barriers".  The GoB is worried 
that REACH goes too far in "restricting access".  According to 
Azeredo, Brazil's chemical governance structure is highly developed 
and in line with existing international standards.  Therefore, the 
GoB believes that a new regimen and structures will harm Brazilian 
commercial interests. 
 
¶2. In response to Scioff's suggestion that the GoB broach the 
talking point concepts with its EU allies, Azeredo stated he would 
call the GoB Mission in Brussels on Monday and evaluate the state of 
affairs, at that time.  He noted that if Brussels concurred with the 
situation's proscribed urgency, the GoB would identify specific 
countries to approach.  Scioff later elicited that Spain was a 
likely target because of its heavy investment into Brazil's chemical 
industry.  Interestingly, Azeredo considers Germany and Great 
Britain to be REACHES most avid champions, due to the protection and 
support it would afford their domestic chemical industries.  He 
further noted that he expects India and China to be of a similar 
mind to Brazil and the USG.
