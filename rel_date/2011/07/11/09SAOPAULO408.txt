Title- Honduran Impasse 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (7-8) says: "After the 
unanimous international condemnation to the coup in Honduras, the 
first glance of hope for an end to the impasse arises........It 
seems obvious that Zelaya should make a commitment to abandon the 
Chavista route, by which he was trying to extend his mandate in 
Honduras, whose laws do not allow for reelection.  But that's an 
issue to be solved by the Hondurans.  The regional and international 
community has gone as far as it can in this case - and instituted a 
benchmark for the defense of democracy on the continent." 
 
Title- The start of a new beginning 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (7-8) states: "...The 
two-day-visit....was the first step of translating in facts of the 
White House initiative to engage the Kremlin in resuming relations 
between the two countries.....Breaking the inertia that dated back 
to Clinton times and was followed by a complete lack of action in 
the Bush era, he [Obama] focused on the issue of bilateral 
agreements about the control of nuclear arsenals.  The importance of 
such a policy is doubled.  For the world, it signals a live 
commitment to non-proliferation.....For the signatories, it means 
that the joint control is an incentive to rapprochement, mutual 
confidence and understanding in a series of areas, for the simple 
fact that it works through cooperative programs....With his move in 
this direction, Obama has indicated to Moscow that.....its remains a 
major atomic power......this is a good deal for both sides in times 
of crisis, just for the costs that its maintenance generates. 
Another success for Obama was the Kremlin's decision to allow 4,500 
U.S. flights per year through Russian territory with armaments for 
military operations in Afghanistan...." 
 
Title- The festival of meetings in Aquila 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (7-8) notes: "Leaders 
of the world major developed and developing economies meeting in 
L'Aquila will produce in three days much more political statements 
than practical decisions for immediate application.....The balance 
will be positive if there are practical decisions concerning the 
most dramatic issue at this moment: the food crisis in poor 
countries...."
