SUBJECT: PARAGUAY: PEACEKEEPING FORCE MAY GET BRAZILIAN 
SUPPORT 
 
 
Classified By: A/POL Sterling Tilley. Reason: 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) On 6/28, Pol Couns learned of the possibility that 
Brazil would be supporting a team of Paraguayan Peacekeepers 
for Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) in Haiti.  Post has 
confirmed that Brazil approved USD 1.7 million for the 
Paraguayan Military forces.  The funds are designated to be 
used to repair 40 armored vehicles, provide support 
equipment, uniforms and training for one Paraguayan 
Peacekeeping platoon, which will deploy with the Brazilian 
contingent. 
 
¶2. (S) A Paraguayan Army Officer, name protected, told DAO 
that USD 1 million is designated to repair 40 armored 
vehicles which will remain in Paraguay and the remaining USD 
700,000 will be used for support equipment and training for 
the Paraguayan Peacekeeping Platoon for Haiti.  The platoon 
will consist of 5 officers and 25 noncommissioned 
officers/enlisted personnel.  The contact also indicated the 
Brazilians initially wanted the Paraguayan platoon to be 
trained at the Brazilian Peacekeeping School, located in 
Campo Grande, Brazil, but agreed to allow the training to 
continue in Paraguay.  However, the contact said that a 
Brazilian military team was scheduled to arrive on 7/17 to 
oversee the training but has been delayed.  (NOTE: DAO has 
learned that the Brazilian military team is expected to 
arrive within the next two weeks. End Note.) 
 
¶3. (S) The contact also told DAO that the Brazilians recently 
decided to support them because Paraguay politicians have 
stepped up its complaints regarding MERCOSUR and the Itaipu 
Dam.  (NOTE: Whenever Paraguay complains and/or threatens to 
pull out of agreements such as MERCOSUR and the Itaipu Dam, 
the Brazilians routinely offer the Paraguayans some funding 
for other programs to make the Paraguayans happy.  End Note.) 
 
¶4. (C) COMMENT:  The Paraguayans have sought PKO support from 
Spain as well as Chile, after the Brazilians initially 
rejected the Paraguayan request.  Spain has offered equipment 
and support for up to 230 personnel.  That equipment remains 
in Spain and has yet to be released.  The Chilean effort has 
been suspended temporarily, pending the outcome of the 
Brazilian offer of support.  According to the contact, 
although he has received word verbally, there are no 
documents that he has seen that guarantee Brazilian support. 
End Comment.
