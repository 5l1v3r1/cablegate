SUBJECT: BRAZIL-U.S. A NEW OPPORTUNITY 
 
 
Editorial in O Estado de Sao Paulo (2/9) posits: President Luiz 
Inacio Lula da Silva has a good opportunity early in his second 
term, to strengthen political and economic relations between the two 
countries. The U.S. government took the initiative to put the 
subject on the table by sending Undersecretary Nicholas Burns and 
Assistant Secretary Thomas Shannon...In relation to Brazil, the 
undersecretary proposed deepening political relations on a regional 
and global level. According to him, there is no reason the United 
States cannot have the same type of privileged relationship with 
Brazil that is maintains with India...The undersecretary came with 
an outline for discussion. The development of technology for the 
production of biofuels is a good subject for the initial 
agenda...This plan already matches with the Brazilian agenda and 
cooperation with the United States could be productive...If the new 
efforts of strengthening relations between the United States and 
Brazil are continued, there is much room for exploration. The 
economic aspect involves concrete terms of great importance that 
have been ignored these last few years...it is time for the 
Brazilian government to rethink its commercial interests, putting 
aside, at least temporarily, the stagnated regional block 
[Mercosul].
