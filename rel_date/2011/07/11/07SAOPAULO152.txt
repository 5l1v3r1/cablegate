"All Against All" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (2/14) 
editorialized: "The fact that Iran simply ignored the UN Security 
Council order to suspend its uranium enrichment program was not a 
surprise.... According to information available, Iran is at least 
five years away from producing some nuclear arsenal due to 
technological and industrial deficiencies. This fact should be taken 
into consideration by the representatives of the UNSC permanent 
members who will begin discussing on Monday another resolution 
against Tehran. There has been speculation about supposed plans by 
the Bush administration to attack Iran. Israel would also be 
increasingly inclined to carry out a 'preventive attack' such as the 
bombing that destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981. Few actions 
would be capable of worsening the situation in the Middle East. One 
of them would be a military attack against Iran, which would 
transform the region into a war stageinvolving all against all. 
Dissuading Israel fro attacking Iran and at the same time 
increasing iplomatic sanctions against Tehran is the most prudnt 
path to follow."
