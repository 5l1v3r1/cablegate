SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S FAREWELL CALL ON FM HOR NAMHONG: DEEPER 
RELATIONS WITH A MORE MATURE CAMBODIA 
 
REF: PHNOM PENH 679 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. In an August 21 farewell call on Foreign Minister 
Hor Namhong, the Ambassador congratulated the FM on his diplomacy in 
respect to the dispute over Preah Vihear, highlighted the continued 
strengthening of bilateral relations, expressed his optimism about 
proposed KRT funding from the United States, and conveyed the 
importance of a high level meeting between the UN's David Tolbert and 
a representative from the RGC.  FM Hor Namhong expressed his 
commitment to not only settle the Preah Vihear dispute peacefully, 
but to use the same strategy for the two smaller temples which are 
also being contested.  He also stressed the importance of U.S. 
funding for the UN side of the KRT in order to deliver justice to the 
Cambodian people.  The FM rounded out the meeting by requesting U.S. 
support for Cambodia's bid to become a non-permanent member of the UN 
Security Council for a two year term beginning in 2013.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Improved Bilateral Relations 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The FM expressed appreciation for improved U.S.-Cambodian 
relations during the last few years.  Hor Namhong vowed to continue 
to work to strengthen the "sanctity of a relationship which is 
growing day to day," and specifically thanked the Ambassador for 
support in the areas of health and education.  The Ambassador 
credited the Cambodian government for the improvements in bilateral 
relations and stated his appreciation for the RGC's efforts to foster 
better understanding and cooperation between the two countries.  The 
Ambassador noted that it will take considerably more time and 
continued effort to overcome misunderstandings engendered over the 
last fifty years, but said the close collaboration will continue 
after his departure.  To further emphasize this point, he told Hor 
Namhong about Deputy Secretary Negroponte's proposed visit next 
month, explaining that the Deputy Secretary will be the highest level 
State representative to come to Cambodia in several years and that 
his visit reflects the increasing importance the U.S. places on our 
bilateral relations with Cambodia. 
 
Preah Vihear: Peaceful Solution Imperative 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Ambassador praised Hor Namhong's diplomacy in response 
to the Preah Vihear standoff.  He described the FM's recent statement 
to the press which compared the negotiations on Preah Vihear to a 
"steamroller," in that they are "slow but moving ahead," to be 
particularly astute.  Hor Namhong noted that he was pleased with the 
result of the recent talks with his Thai FM counterpart and the King 
of Thailand, with all parties agreeing that a peaceful solution is 
imperative for the two neighbors.  However, his suggestion to use the 
same type of diplomacy in relation to Ta Moan Thom and Ta Moan Touch, 
two additional border temples which Thailand has occupied in the 
past, was not commented on by his Thai interlocutors.  Nonetheless, 
Hor Namhong affirmed that once the area is stable, it is his 
government's intention to reopen the international border crossing at 
Preah Vihear to tourists entering from Thailand.  Hor Namhong 
mentioned that some UN Security Council members continue to watch the 
issue closely and noted that the Cambodian permanent representative 
intended to provide UNSC members with an update on the success, so 
far, of the bilateral approach. 
 
Khmer Rouge Tribunal: The road ahead 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) The conversation then quickly turned to the topic of the 
KRT, with Hor Namhong expressing his concern that the UN side is 
facing a shortfall of funding.  He stated the ECCC needs 
approximately 40-50 million dollars to see it through to the end of 
2009, and appealed to the U.S. government to contribute.  The 
Ambassador responded that the embassy is deeply committed to a just 
accounting for KR-era crimes and noted that the issue is being 
considered at the highest levels of the Department.  The Ambassador 
speculated that if other countries were to see America donating, they 
would follow suit and lift the tribunal out of financial jeopardy. 
The Ambassador noted recent allegations of corruption, which a RGC 
meeting with the UN's David Tolbert will only help to resolve.  He 
urged Hor Namhong to ensure David Tolbert is received by the 
government at a high level. (Note: in a later meeting, the Ambassador 
was told by DPM Sok An that he would meet with Tolbert.  End Note.) 
 
UN Security Council: A request for support 
------------------------------------------

¶5.  (SBU) Hor Namhong concluded the meeting by appealing to the U.S. 
for support of Cambodia's 2012 bid to become a non-permanent member 
of the UN Security Council in 2013 and mentioned that ASEAN is behind 
the nomination.  Given its recent history with genocide, civil war, 
and a UN transition, Cambodia is well placed to sit on the Council 
and share knowledge with other members.  The Ambassador responded 
that Cambodia's experiences would certainly bring an important 
perspective to UNSC deliberations (Note: While ASEAN apparently backs 
Cambodia's bid, it appears that the ROK is breaking Asian solidarity 
and competing for the 2013 seat.  End Note.) 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT:  As reflected in the congenial and mutually 
respectful meeting between Hor Namhang and the Ambassador, the 
U.S.-Cambodian relationship is clearly stronger and more cooperative 
than in previous years.  The Cambodian government's willingness to 
accept U.S. advice and exercise restraint, both physical and verbal, 
in its recent dealings with Thailand has demonstrated a new sense of 
calmness and maturity for this young democracy.  Indeed, in a large 
number of areas, including human rights, Burma, trafficking, 
Montagnards, North Korea and the KRT, Cambodia has demonstrated a 
surprising degree of trust and confidence in U.S. advice and 
guidance.
