SUBJECT: BRAZILIAN RESPONSE ON THE GOLDSTONE REPORT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 112828 
 
¶1.  On November 3, Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Carlos 
Eduardo da Cunha Oliveira of the Human Rights Division of the 
Ministry of External Relations (MRE).  Poloff stressed that, 
because of our serious concerns about the Goldstone Report, 
the USG sought to prevent passage of a harmful General 
Assembly resolution and to keep any future action on the 
report out of the Security Council, ICC, ICJ and other 
international venues. 
 
¶2.  Oliveira noted that Brazil in principle prefers to deal 
with the Goldstone Report in the HRC, believing to refer it 
out weakens the HRC.  Brazil nonetheless voted in favor of a 
resolution in the Special Session of the HRC that referred 
the report to the UN General Assembly.  Oliveira explained by 
saying that the resolution contained a "constructive 
ambiguity" that permitted the HRC to deliberate and determine 
when and under what circumstances the Goldstone Report might 
be referred to other UN bodies.  Meanwhile, there was an 
opportunity for Israel and the Palestinian Authority to 
engage in a constructive manner. 
 
¶3.  Poloff replied that the Goldstone Report is complicating 
the Middle East peace process and urged that Brazil oppose 
General Assembly action on the report. 
 
¶4.  Oliveira said that he would convey our concerns to MRE 
Under Secretary for Political Affairs Vera Machado, who in 
turn will instruct the Brazilian mission in New York.  He 
said she will be interested in the impact of a potential 
resolution on the functioning of the HRC, which Brazil 
regards as an important institution, and in "the bigger 
political picture."
