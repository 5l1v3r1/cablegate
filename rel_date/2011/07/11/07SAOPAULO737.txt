 "Democracy In Islam" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (8/30) 
editorialized: "Are democracy and Islamism compatible? Turkey is 
trying to demonstrate that they are, but the nation is facing a hard 
challenge as a result of former Prime Minister Abdullah G|l's 
election for president. G|l is a moderate Muslim, but every 
religious inclination in Turkey is sufficient to raise the secular 
establishment's distrust.... The military was not pleased [with 
G|l's election], but opted for not overreacting. An adventure 
outside of established institutional boundaries could jeopardize 
once and for all Turkey's chances of becoming an EU member.... For 
Turkey to become the first full democracy in the Islamic world, it 
is necessary that the state remains secular even under an Islamic 
party, and without military tutelage."
