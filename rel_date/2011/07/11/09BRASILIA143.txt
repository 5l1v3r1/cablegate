PROSPECTS FOR ENGAGEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY

¶1.  (SBU) At a meeting on January 13, Brazilian Minister of Science 
and Technology (MCT) Sergio Rezende stressed to Ambassador Sobel 
that climate change and the related issue of energy are excellent 
areas for cooperation between the Brazil and the United States. 
Rezende said that although climate change negotiations are led by 
the Ministry of External Relations (MRE), his ministry - as well as 
the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) and the Secretariat of 
Strategic Planning - has a role to play in determining Brazil's 
approach to climate change.  In particular, MCT oversees a network 
of government laboratories and research institutes dealing with 
climate change and biofuels and other energy research. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Rezende encouraged increased engagement between USG and 
Brazilian researchers to help the two sides better understand their 
respective positions in the run up to Copenhagen.  While these 
meetings and collaborative efforts would not be part of the formal 
negotiation process, they would represent an opportunity for both 
sides to better understand each others' positions and to find areas 
of strong mutual interest.  Rezende also indicated that several 
non-governmental opinion-makers such as former Environment Secretary 
for the state of Sao Paulo, Professor Jose Goldemberg - a researcher 
who recently co-chaired a report on energy and climate change with 
U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu - can affect this debate. 
(Note.  The Ambassador recently met with Prof. Goldemberg to learn 
his views on climate change issues.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) COMMENT.  Embassy Brasilia has a particularly strong 
working relationship with the Ministry of Science and Technology. 
This relationship provides us with a good base from which to help 
develop a stronger, more robust relationship in the areas of climate 
change and energy.  Post will continue to leverage this relationship 
to engage on this important issue.  END COMMENT.
