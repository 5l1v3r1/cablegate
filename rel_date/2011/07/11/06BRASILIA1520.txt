SUBJECT: BRAZIL ESTH UPDATE, JUNE/JULY 2006 
 
NEW STATE PARK 
--------------- 
¶1. The Government of the Brazilian state of Para has approved the 
creation of the second the biggest protected area in the country. 
The state forest (Flota) of Paru will be 36,000 square kilometers 
(3.6 million hectares), an area larger than France, and it will be 
used for both preservation and sustainable exploitation of natural 
resources.  All timber production will have to be certified and 
there are also plans to develop activities such as research, mining 
and tourism in the forest. 
 
The Brazilian Government also has plans to approve another 13 
state-forests, all of which will allow both conservation and 
sustainable economic development of the areas.  Paru state-forest 
will be the model for the other 13 Flotas that the Brazilian 
Government intends to establish. 
 
PRESERVATION LAW HURDLES 
------------------------- 
¶2. Farmers and rural producers from the state of Sao Paulo do not 
agree with new a preservation decree implemented in June, 2006.  The 
decree, part of a Brazilian Forest Code, requires that 20% of rural 
properties be covered by native vegetation.  The problem is that 
most of the land in the state is already being used for agricultural 
purposes.  According to analysts from the Agriculture Economics 
Institute (IEA), an estimated 3.7 million hectares of productive 
land would have to be turned into native vegetation, resulting in 
the loss of US$ 2.6 billion in agriculture revenues and 136 thousand 
jobs. 
 
BRAZILIAN NATIONAL FRESHWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN 
--------------------------------------------- 
¶3. The Government of Brazil recently approved the country's first 
National Freshwater Management Plan.  The plan includes more than 25 
national and regional programs that encompass objectives, goals and 
guidelines for the sustainable use of Brazil's freshwater resources 
until 2020. The plan's main components are the adoption of 
scientifically defined freshwater ecoregions and analyses of 
hydroelectric potentials, navigation and water utilization regimes 
for drinking water, other household uses, industrial uses and 
irrigation.  Brazil possesses 12% of the world's freshwater reserves 
and is the first country in Latin America to have a National Water 
Management Plan. 
 
CRITICAL DROUGHT SITUATION 
--------------------------- 
¶4. Due to the second worst drought in the state's history, 45 cities 
in Parana were put under a state of emergency, bringing the total 
number to over 250 cities in Brazil's Southern region. 
Approximately 1.8 million people in Parana will experience water 
rationing over the next couple of weeks.  River volumes are falling 
daily and the financial loss in Parana's agricultural sector is 
estimated to be US$ 845 million due to the lack of water.  The rainy 
season is expected to start in September. 
 
BIOTECHNOLOGY NEWS 
------------------- 
¶5. A Brazilian consortium of GoB and private entities just unveiled 
a US$ 3 billion strategy aimed at making Brazil a world leader in 
biotechnology.  The plan was announced during The Brazilian Forum of 
Biotechnology Competitiveness and it will identify areas with the 
potential to boost the competitiveness of Brazilian industry, 
increase Brazil's participation in global trade, speed up the 
industry's economic growth and create jobs.  Out of the total 
amount, US$ 530 million is earmarked for health-related 
biotechnology, including the production of drugs and vaccines for 
neglected diseases and research in the fields of genomics, 
proteomics, nano-biotechnology and stem cell science. The plan, 
which will be presented to President Lula da Silva for approval 
later this year, also provides for new funding mechanisms, training 
and improving infrastructure of research institutions.
