Classified By: DCM Jefferson Brown for reasons 1.4 (B&D) 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered relevant points on U.S. UNGA 
priorities to MFA's Multilateral Affairs Directorate on 
September 21, 2007.  He was not able to obtain a response 
until September 25 because Lourdes Puma, MFA Director General 
of Multilateral Affairs, was on travel. 
 
¶2.  (C) Climate Change.  Puma said that President Correa had 
spoken on September 24 on the issue of climate change, 
focusing his comments on the responsibility of developed 
countries to assist the developing world for contamination 
caused in the economic success of the developed countries. 
His objective was to raise support for Correa's initiative to 
avoid drilling in the ITT oil fields in the Amazon in 
exchange for financial donations from the developed world. 
She said that she was unaware of any concrete offers of 
assistance so far.  Puma apologized for not being aware of 
the Major Economies Initiative on Energy Security and Climate 
Change.  PolOff provided a copy of the "Fact Sheet: A New 
International Climate Change Framework" available on the 
Whitehouse.gov website.  Puma cautioned that she was doubtful 
that Ecuador would support this initiative as the USG's 
positions on climate change have previously differed from the 
Kyoto Protocol and the G-8, which Ecuador supports. 
 
¶3.  (C) Human Rights and Human Dignity.  Puma noted that 
Ecuador supports the Third Committee in the UNGA, but did not 
clarify Ecuador's position regarding the Human Rights 
Council.  She affirmed that Ecuador normally supports all 
initiatives that protect the rights of women and children and 
would likely support the resolution on "Condemning the Use of 
Rape as an Instrument of State Policy," adding that rape is 
one of the worst violations of human rights. 
 
¶4.  (C) UN Reform.  Puma affirmed that Ecuador is in favor of 
general UN reform, said that she could not confirm support of 
the U.S. initiatives, but that she would study them.  Puma 
asserted that Ecuador strongly supports Brazil's bid to a 
permanent seat on the UNSC, although without veto rights, 
clarifying that Ecuador does not believe that additional 
members should be given veto power.  She called Brazil a 
close ally of Ecuador and the best choice in Latin America 
for such a seat, but recognized that Mexico and Argentina are 
opposed to this.  She added that Ecuador generally supports 
the G-4 (Brazil, India, Germany and Japan) in their bids for 
a permanent UNSC seat, explaining Ecuador believes that the 
UNSC lacks appropriate representation. 
 
¶5.  (C) Lebanon.  While expressing her understanding of the 
need to support the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, Puma 
questioned the budget established by the SYG and said that 
Ecuador's resources are thin, so financial support may be 
difficult.  See also SEPTEL in response to STATE 129919.
