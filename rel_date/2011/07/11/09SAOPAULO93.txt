Financial market crisis; protectionism; Sao Paulo 
 
Title- Obama and Protectionism 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (2-12) says: "....the 
virus of protectionism has been spreading rapidly all around the 
world since the aggravation of the financial and economic crisis 6 
months ago.... The risk will be lower if President Barack 
understands the seriousness of the problem and the responsibility of 
the one that runs the largest economy of the world.  If he vetoes 
the protectionist clause of the fiscal package, he might be 
criticized internally but no authority outside the U.S. will be able 
to ignore his message.  If he accepts protectionism, he might 
compromise the possibilities of success in the next G20 meeting 
scheduled for April in London." 
 
Title- How to wrap and sell the fish 
 
Op-Ed in Folha de S.Paulo (2-12) by Eliane Cantanhede states: "...Up 
to now, the GOB's view is that [President Barack Obama's] package, 
in addition to having reactionary symbolism, has more propaganda 
[value] than appropriate practical measures...everything stays the 
same, but with enough dabs of color to let Obama receive occasional 
glories and keep him on stage, [because that is] what he 
likes....the important [thing] is not to make and innovate, [the 
important thing] is to wrap the fish very well and sell it even 
better." 
 
Title- Israel at the Right 
 
Editorial in liberal in Folha de S.Paulo (2-12) says: 
"....Regardless of the [Israeli election] result, the political 
scenario after the election seems to have been determined before 
[votes were cast].  It reveals a fragmented Parliament and a 
political consensus that is hardening itself with its relations with 
Palestinians.  No force chosen to lead the new government will offer 
a cheerful perspective to the peace agenda." 
 
Title- The tough formation of a government to run Israel 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Economico (2-12) states: 
"Breaking down the election results indicates that Israel will 
probably not take on any relevant initiatives towards peace, unless 
it is forced to do so by external circumstances.  [And those] are 
already taking place with [President] Barack Obama in the White 
House.  Obama received yesterday an encouraging sign from Iran's 
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who said he was ready for 'a dialogue 
in a climate of equality and mutual respect.'....The U.S. will try 
to take the Palestinian Authority out of the isolation in which the 
myopic Israeli policy placed it and although the U.S. preserves 
Israel as a strategic ally in the region, it will stop doing 
everything to please them [Israel].  The effect of pressures for a 
short run negotiation in Israel is unforeseeable.  But it would be 
better received by Kadima than an alliance of Netanyahu's Likud with 
Avigdor Lieberman."
