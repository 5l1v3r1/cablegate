SUBJECT: What a Difference a Decade Makes: Cambodia Sends 
Peacekeepers to Sudan 
 
¶1.  On April 12, Prime Minister Hun Sen presided over a 
ceremony for the 109 Cambodian peacekeeping troops being 
sent to Sudan to participate in UN sponsored demining 
operations. (Note: There are a total of 135 but 26 have 
already departed for the Sudan. End Note.)  This is the 
first time Cambodia has contributed to UN peacekeeping 
operations.  He expressed pride that RCAF will join this 
international force after having UN peacekeepers stationed 
in Cambodia a decade ago. 
 
¶2.  Hun Sen announced that RCAF will only participate in 
United Nations peacekeeping operations.  He stated that 
deployment in any other capacity was in contravention to 
Article 53 of the Cambodian Constitution.  The deployment of 
RCAF would only be to support humanitarian efforts; he noted 
Cambodia must receive an invitation from the UN before every 
such deployment.  Hun Sen stated that he looked forward to 
Cambodia participating in future peacekeeping operations but 
RCAF needed to learn from this experience. 
 
¶3.  The PM announced three measures for the families of the 
troops.  He stated that the government would pay a donation 
of $1,900 per soldier to each soldier's family.  The RCAF 
would continue to provide each soldier's salary and food 
ration to his family.  Most importantly, he provided 
assurances that the UN salary of each soldier would be his 
to keep. 
 
¶4.  Hun Sen stated that Cambodia must increase its capacity 
for peacekeeping operations.  He asked the donor community 
to provide training and equipment for medical personnel to 
serve in peacekeeping operations. 
 
¶5.  The PM also imparted lessons from Cambodia's UNTAC 
experience to the troops.  The PM asked the troops not to 
use their positions to bring goods duty free into Sudan for 
sale on their local markets which would disrupt the local 
economy, as happened in Cambodia during UNTAC.  He also 
asked the troops to respect the safety of the people and the 
sovereignty of Sudan. 
 
¶6.  Comment.  The deployment of 135 Cambodian troops to 
Sudan shows that after years of receiving from the UN, 
Cambodia is finally giving back. The PM's announcement that 
the RGC is allowing each soldier to keep their UN salary is 
a positive sign; many other countries take the UN-provided 
salaries of their peacekeepers.  The Defense Attache Office 
will be providing a separate report after the deployment.
