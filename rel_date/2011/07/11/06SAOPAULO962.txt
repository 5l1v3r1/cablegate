Fighting Crime 
Article in center-right  O Estado de S. Paulo (9/3) says: "Militant 
anti-americanism is a contagious disease that corrodes the nerve 
cells of those who allow themselves to be contaminated. Lately, 
agents that enable contamination by this disease had a field day 
'proving' that...the creation of the Regional Intelligence Center in 
Foz do Iguagu...the opening of a base for the National Anti-Drug 
Secretariat on the boarder city of Pedro Juan Caballero...plus the 
 
SIPDIS 
military maneuvers Americans hold periodically in Paraguay are 
unrefutable evidence that the U.S. has started the process of taking 
over the Southern Cone countries. That is complete nonsense...if the 
U.S. is interested...it is because they are the final destination of 
most of the narcotics that flow through those borders. It is, 
therefore, a legitimate interest. It is an even more legitimate 
interest of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay to monitor, prevent and 
stop trafficking on their borders...and if the U.S. can contribute 
with financial and technical resources, so much the better." 
 
Modernizing Commercial Diplomacy 
Article in business-centered Valor Econtmico (9/5) states: "The 
recent suspension of the Doha Round caught Brazil off-guard, unlike 
most emerging countries...Betting everything on the WTO and 
neglecting regional and bilateral deals is a serious strategic 
mistake...Abandoning the FTAA and EU-Mercosul negotiations without 
offering any alternative as well as politicizing the Mercosul are 
policies that harm national interests...Our commercial diplomacy has 
fallen victim to extra-commercial interests, such as a seat at the 
Security Council, the integration demagogery lead by Chavez and an 
anti-americanism that cannot see the opportunities of access to the 
markets of North America. A significant change of course...would 
demand the creation in the executive-level of an agency solely 
dedicated to international negotiations, separate from the 
chancellery and with a specific mandate."
