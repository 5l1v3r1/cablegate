"Benedict 16th, Diplomat" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo 
(11/30) editorialized: "If not a triumph of diplomacy, Pope 
Benedict's visit to Turkey at least indicates that the pontiff is 
paying attention to the religious dialogue and the political 
developments resulting from the so-called clash of civilizations.... 
If the diplomatic gesture is capable of helping the main Muslim 
religious authorities to subdue their believers' spirit, then the 
chances of repetition of violent episodes such as the protests 
unleashed in Denmark by the publication of cartoons considered 
offensive to Mohammed will diminish.... Obviously, the Catholic 
leader could not think otherwise.... It is clear that this will not 
be enough to disarm tensions or to make followers of one religion 
accept another one as equal, but it is already a step towards 
non-confrontation."  McMullen
