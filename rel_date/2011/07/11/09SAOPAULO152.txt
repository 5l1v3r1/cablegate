Chavez fulfills his words 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-18) states: "When 
ordering the military occupation of the three most busy ports in 
Venezuela, coronel Hugo Chavez, once more, fulfilled his 
words....the new law is clearly unconstitutional....nevertheless, 
this is an aspect that has never kept the general from 
sleeping....Hugo Chavez is completing, thus, the process of 
undermining the power of states and municipalities run by the 
opposition." 
 
Is the world really more closed? 
 
Op-ed in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-18) by Andre Meloni 
Nassar states: "....there is no doubt that the decrease in 
international trade comes along with more intensive uses of 
restrictive measures.....even though the efforts to use the G20 
meeting in London to reinforce the curse of restrictive measures to 
trade are valid, we know that countries will not renounce to them. 
Our consolation is that in the current crisis, unlike that of 1929, 
the drop in trade is the outcome not the cause."
