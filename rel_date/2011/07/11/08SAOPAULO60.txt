"Closing Guantanamo" 
 
Political writer Marcos Nobre maintained in liberal, largest 
national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo (2/12): "The wars in 
Iraq and Afghanistan have practically disappeared from political 
debates in the US, as if the public opinion battle against Bush had 
already been won. But things are not that simple. Connected with 
Iraq is Guantanamo, the American base in Cuba where prisoners of 
what the conservatives call 'war against terror' have been kept. 
There has been torture in Guantanamo, and there the prisoners are 
not formally accused or have habeas corpus rights. The four main 
presidential candidates have already said that they favor the 
closing of that prison. Closing Guantanamo is certainly important, 
but it does not resolve a basic problem: the flagrant violation of 
fundamental rights.... And today Guantanamo is not an isolated case. 
 France has just approved legislation allowing in principle to keep 
a prisoner in jail for life even after his punishment is over."
