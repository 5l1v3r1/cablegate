¶1.  Brazil's National Energy Policy Council has authorized the 
National Petroleum Agency (ANP) to host an auction to license oil 
and gas rights on December 18, 2008.  However, no offshore blocks 
will be offered at the "10th Round" auction to the disappointment of 
many industry representatives.  Licensing bid rounds, held annually 
in Brazil since 1997, were suspended in late 2007 following the 
discovery of potentially massive "pre-salt" oil and gas reserves 
located in ultra-deep waters off of Brazil's southeastern coast. 
(REFTELS A, B, C)  The government is considering a reform of the 
regulatory framework for exploration and production in these areas 
to raise the state's share of revenues. (REFTELS D and G) 
¶2.  The Council apparently disregarded ANP's recommendation to 
include offshore opportunities in the upcoming auction, instead 
deciding to limit further concession contracts to Brazil's 
less-attractive, riskier sedimentary basin.  The 10th Round will 
include 171 onshore blocks covering 107,000 square kilometers in 
eight basins: Amazonas, Potiguar, Parecis, Sco Francisco, 
Sergipe-Alagoas, Rectncavo, Paran and Pernambuco-Paraba. 
According to ANP, there is little-to-no knowledge or seismic data 
for over 94 percent of Brazil's 7.5 million square kilometer onshore 
sedimentary basin. 
¶3.  Reaction from industry representatives and energy sector experts 
to the announcement of the 10th Round is luke-warm, at best.  Though 
industry had been pressuring for the government to resume auctions, 
it also strongly argued that the government needed to offer 
attractive opportunities even if pre-salt blocks were off the table. 
 The government's decision was exaggerated by sensitivities to the 
pre-salt debate -- it could have easily added areas in shallow 
waters, according to Adriano Pires, a Rio-based energy specialist 
and Director of the Center for Brazilian Infrastructure. 
¶4.  "We have taken away the offshore fields, just to be safe," local 
press quoted Energy Minister Edison Lobco as saying in Braslia.  He 
also cited concerns about the ability of industry, including 
Petrobras, to take on more offshore exploration at this time. 
(REFTEL E)  While Minister Lobao announced that there is a "big 
group" of oil companies who are interested only in land blocks, it 
is unlikely that the 10th Round will garner much interest from 
Petrobras, the six U.S. oil and gas companies operating in Brazil, 
or other major players such as newcomer OGX (REFTEL F).  In fact, 
over the last year, ANP has been seeking the U.S. Government's help 
to learn how to better promote on-shore opportunities given the 
current lack interest in Brazil.  Minister Lobao also requested the 
assistance of Acting Deputy Secretary of Energy Jeffery Kupfer 
during his August visit here (REFTEL H) and has spoken with 
Ambassador Sobel regularly about stimulating U.S. industry interest 
in these areas, possibly through the involvement of Commerce 
Secretary Gutierrez (REFTEL G).  Lobao has also expressed his 
willingness to travel to the U.S. as part of a campaign to solicit 
the interest of smaller and independent developers (Note: a request 
to schedule a date is still pending with Lobao's office). 
¶5.  ANP Director Haroldo Lima has recently expressed doubt that the 
agency could even hold a new licensing round before the end of 2008 
due to the limited time frame; it is likely that the 10th Round 
could be postponed until 2009. 
¶6.  This cable has been coordinated with and cleared by Embassy 
Brasilia.
