"Without Fidel, Tensions Will Worsen In Cuba" 
 
Business-oriented Valor Economico (2/21) editorialized: "Cuba will 
not be the same after Fidel Castro's resignation.  The Cuban 
Stalinist regime, which was isolated by the will of its enemies, 
especially the US, and by its leaders' ideology, has remote chances 
of survival.... Without Fidel, the already existing intolerable 
tensions will worsen.  The socialist experience became a 
dictatorship of State and failed.  The only way out is an opening to 
be conducted by a group of bureaucrats who do not have the 
dictator's charisma or popularity.... The US economic embargo is 
mortal for Cuba's economy.... Equality in poverty is an efficient 
but not eternal antidote to a situation that, looking to the future, 
is desperate."
