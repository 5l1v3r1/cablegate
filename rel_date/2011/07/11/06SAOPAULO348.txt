¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Seven inmates died during a 
21-hour rebellion that rocked a public jail in 
Sao Paulo state March 23-24.  This deadly event 
occurred two days after a series of prison 
disturbances in four municipalities in the state, 
and is believed to have been organized by the 
powerful gang, the First Capital Command (PCC). 
Riots continue at present.  Governor and now 
opposition presidential candidate Geraldo Alckmin 
believes that the rebellions are politically 
motivated.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Seven Dead 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (U) A 21-hour rebellion caused seven deaths 
at the "Cadeia Publica" (public jail) in Jundiai, 
Sao Paulo state, on March 23.  The seven inmates 
died from asphyxiation from burning mattresses. 
The rebellion was in part a protest against 
overcrowding in a facility which was built to hold 
120 persons, but housed 484.  The uprising, which 
ended when riot troops entered the facility, is 
considered linked to prison riots throughout the 
state earlier in the week. 
 
Chaos in the Prison System 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) The week of rioting began on Monday, 
March 20 at the Odon Ramos Magalhaes Penitentiary 
in Ipero, in the interior of Sao Paulo state. 
Twenty-two persons were wounded, and the rebellion 
continued until riot police arrived.  Riots soon 
followed at one other penitentiary and in three 
"Temporary Detention Centers (CDPs)," also part 
of the State Penitentiary system, in response to 
the presence of riot police at Ipero. (NOTE: 
The availability of cell phones throughout the 
state prison and jail system makes it possible for 
inmate and gang leaders in different facilities to 
coordinate actions.  See ref A.  END NOTE.) 
Disturbances followed at facilities in Maua, 
Caiua, Mogi das Cruzes, and Franco da Rocha in Sao 
Paulo city.  The week of March 27 began with more 
headaches for state authorities, with rebellions 
in four additional CDPs and at the public jail in 
Tatui in the interior. 
 
Overcrowding a Common Characteristic 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) All the facilities involved in recent 
riots are overcrowded.  For example, the Franco 
da Rocha facility was built to accommodate 600 
inmates but currently houses 1,177 persons. 
Statistics published by the Secretariat for 
Prisons highlight state-wide overcrowding.  The 
prison system was built to accommodate 95,153 
prisoners, but currently incarcerates 122,984. 
Furthermore, over 17,000 persons remain in public 
jails and holding cells administered by the State 
Secretariat for Public Security, despite promises 
 
SIPDIS 
by Governor Alckmin to close these facilities and 
transfer inmates to the CDPs of the Prison 
Administration.  Human rights workers decry the 
often lengthy time detainees spend in public jails 
after arrest.  A credible NGO source told Poloff 
that the State Secretariat for Public Security, 
which administers the public jails, has no budget 
to provide inmates with basic toiletry supplies, 
let alone social or educational programs, leading 
those waiting official transfer to the penal system 
in worse conditions than they will face in prison. 
 
Power of the PCC 
---------------- 
 
SAO PAULO 00000348  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The PCC is widely believed to be behind 
the prison and jail riots of the last week and a 
half. (NOTE: Ref A discussed the growing power of 
the PCC within the penitentiary system. END NOTE.) 
According to press reports, the PCC will continue 
disturbances if certain demands are not met, including 
an end to the hated "Differentiated Disciplinary 
Regime," which allows judges to sentence inmates who 
commit crimes while in prison to up to a year in 
solitary confinement in high security facilities. 
In 2001 the PCC was believed to be responsible 
for a series of riots and rebellions that 
simultaneously rocked 29 facilities throughout 
the state. 
 
Political Motivation? 
--------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Press reports indicate that Governor and now 
opposition PSDB presidential candidate Geraldo Alckmin 
believes that the series of recent prison disturbances 
are politically motivated.  The rebellions began just 
days after AlckminQs nomination was announced by his 
partyQs president. (ref B).  Francisco de Assis 
Santana, Director of Training for the Sao Paulo State 
Penitentiary System, told Poloff that overcrowding and 
the influence of the PCC are the reasons behind the 
riots.  Santana states that the PCC, working with 
the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra 
(Landless Rural Workers Movement - MST), seeks to 
destabilize the government.  Poloff sought 
clarification whether the PCC and MST work together 
or merely along parallel lines.  Santana stated that 
the groups work together in many instances.  He pointed 
out that in the rural far west of Sao Paulo state, both 
MST activists and PCC gang leaders are incarcerated in 
the same prisons.  Communication in and between 
facilities is not a problem.  (ref C).  Santana foresees 
a long year of disturbances, believing that the upcoming 
presidential election and the World Cup soccer 
championship will create a heated environment inside 
prisons. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT:  This latest wave of prison uprisings 
comes just as Governor Alckmin is under the spotlight 
as a presidential candidate.  Some journalists suggest 
that the PCC wishes to draw attention to public security 
as AlckminQs "Achilles heel."  Whether or not the wave 
of disturbances is related to the governor's candidacy, 
the power of the PCC within the state detention system 
is evident and worrisome. END COMMENT.
