¶1.  (U) THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR 
INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On December 9, Environment, Science and Technology, and 
Health (ESTH) Counselor briefed Antonio Carlos Hummel, Director for 
the Department of Forests, in the Brazilian environmental agency 
(IBAMA) about the amendments to the Lacey Act, including the 
impending need to have a plant import declaration (REFTEL A). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hummel and his staff were very interested in the 
amendments and its relationship to the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora.  On a 
more practical level, they were interested in the details of the 
plant import declaration, and how it would be filled out.  We have 
informed him that based on the information on the APHIS website, the 
importer to the United States would be the one to sign the form. 
IBAMA has run into difficulty in working with other branches of the 
Brazilian government with export documentation and certifications, 
specifically with the customs officials and the CITES certificates. 
(SEE REFTEL B).  Thus, IBAMA has decided to take remedial action and 
take complete control for CITES imports and exports. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) NOTE.  On August 21, 2006, the Environment Ministry 
adopted a new regulation (IN 112) which requires the use of a 
control document, called the Documento de Origem Florestal (DOF) or 
the Forest Origin Document.  The DOF is used in connection with 
transportation and storage of unprocessed wood.  IBAMA issues the 
DOF.  The DOF is a domestic tool to help reduce illegal logging. 
END NOTE. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Hummel said he and his staff would like to have a video 
conference with USG counterparts to discuss in further detail how 
this new policy will be implemented.  Post supports this suggestion 
and is ready to work with USG agencies to organize this discussion, 
including providing an interpreter.
