SUBJECT: BRAZIL: DEMARCHE RESPONSE ON IRAN UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW 
SESSION 
 
REF: 10 STATE 7242; BRASILIA 9 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Lisa Kubiske, Charge d'Affaires; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1.   (C) The Human Rights Department at the Brazilian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MRE) responded favorably to the approach outlined 
in reftel A of using Iran's Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in the 
Human Rights Council (HRC) to pressure Iran on its human rights 
performance.  MRE Department Deputy Director Nathanael Souza told 
poloff that Brazil supports using the forum to urge Iran to fulfill 
UN commitments, including the need to finalize the visits from the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special 
Rapporteur for Torture.  He described the HRC as a place in which 
countries could "be more honest," asking tough questions without 
feeling the pressure to vote on specific resolutions. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (C) Souza asked if we planned to press Iran in the UPR on 
repression of the Baha'i.  Poloff encouraged Brazil to question 
Iran about the Baha'i during the forum, emphasizing U.S. support 
but also suggesting that Brazil could be out in front on the 
specific issue of advocating for the Baha'i.  Souza told us that 
President Lula's Worker's Party (PT) has been and will continue 
pushing MRE to raise treatment of the Baha'i with Iran because 
several PT politicians and high-ranking party members are Baha'i 
converts.  Earlier this month, MRE Undersecretary for Political 
Affairs Vera Machado met with the Iranian Ambassador in Brazil to 
press him on the Baha'i and received a less-than-satisfactory 
answer (see ref B). 
 
 
 
¶3.  (C) MRE Undersecretary Machado is scheduled to be in Geneva 
during the dates mentioned in ref A for NEA Deputy Assistant 
Secretary Limbert's visit.  Souza expressed interest in scheduling 
a meeting in Geneva between senior U.S. and Brazilian officials 
working on Iran-related issues, but was not in a position to 
comment further.  President Lula, who received Iranian President 
Ahmadinejad in November, is tentatively scheduled to visit Iran 
during the first half of 2010. 
 
 
 
¶4. (C) Comment: Neither past statements in support of the UPR nor 
the favorable response by Itamaraty to this demarche should be seen 
as presaging hard-hitting criticism of Iran, even if Brazil is 
almost certain to raise the Baha'i issue.  There is nothing to 
suggest that Brazil will move very far off its careful "neutral" 
posture vis-C -vis Iran, which the GOB claims is necessary as it 
builds rapport with the GOI that will advance Brazil's policy of 
continued and intensified engagement with Iran on human rights and 
non-proliferation issues.  End comment.
