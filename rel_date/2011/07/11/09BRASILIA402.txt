SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S DEFENSE MINISTER PURSUING REGIONAL 
COUNTERDRUG COOPERATION 
 
REF: BRASILIA 388 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Clifford M. Sobel, Reason 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) In a discussion with Ambassador Sobel March 28, 
Brazilian Defense Minister Nelson Jobim (protect) said he 
knew of President Lula's offer to President Obama during 
their March 14 meeting to look for ways that the region could 
work with the United States on counterdrug issues, possibly 
through the South American Defense Council (SADC) of the 
Union of South American Nations (UNASUL).  He said that the 
SADC might be the perfect way to get other countries to 
engage their militaries in the fight against drug 
trafficking.  Jobim intends to work the SADC possibility 
directly with Brazilian presidency (not through the Ministry 
of External Relations) and plans to speak to President Lula 
about the matter in the next couple of weeks. 
 
¶2. (C) Jobim told the Ambassador that he is committed to 
getting the military involved in fighting crime on Brazil's 
borders, where the military has legal authority to act on 
criminal matters within a 150-kilometer strip.  The Federal 
Police (DPF) is not up to the task alone, he said.  Jobim 
mentioned his particular concern with regard to the presence 
of Colombian and Mexican drug cartels.  He noted that he has 
a good relationship with his Bolivian counterpart already, 
adding that Lula has asked him to go to Mexico, at Calderon's 
request, to talk about cooperation on counterdrug/public 
security issues. 
 
¶3. (C) Comment: Brazil has generally been hesitant to involve 
the military in counter-crime efforts, both because of the 
military history here and because of concern that it might 
lead to corruption in the military.  Although the latter 
concern is legitimate and would need to be carefully 
monitored, Jobim's plan to engage the military signals a 
major step forward in Brazil's thinking about both the 
severity of transnational crime, and drug trafficking in 
particular, and how to address it.  The issue remains highly 
sensitive, both within the government and among the Brazilian 
public.  Moreover, Jobim's intention to work around 
MRE--which reflects the fact that MRE has not been a central 
player in crafting the GOB approach to military 
cooperation--adds a significant bureaucratic sensitivity to 
the already difficult task of uniting South America in this 
cause.  (Note: In a similar vein, a senior presidency foreign 
policy adviser commented just a week earlier that the 
presidency, rather than MRE, is the principal manager of 
South America policy.  See reftel.) As we engage Brazil on 
regional counterdrug efforts, it will be important to take 
these sensitivities into account.
