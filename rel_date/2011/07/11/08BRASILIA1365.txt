¶1.  (SBU) This cable transmits Brasilia's responses to questions 
(reftel) about the impact that China's hosting of the Olympic Games 
has had on views of China. 
 
A) How closely did the public follow the Beijing Olympic Games? 
 
The Brazilian public followed the games with great interest, 
especially the sports that have been traditionally been popular in 
Brazil and those in which Brazilian athletes were expected to do 
well (soccer, volleyball, swimming, judo, etc.) 
 
B)  How were China and the Games portrayed in local media?   Mostly 
as a sporting competition, or did coverage touch on changes in 
China, discussion of human rights, or China's position in the world, 
or none of the above? 
 
There were many criticisms in the media regarding the lack of 
freedom and human rights violations in China (see examples below) 
 
C)  Was Beijing city or China seen as modern, wealthy, developed? 
Portrayed as an economic threat or opportunity? 
 
China/Beijing was generally seen as modern and increasingly 
developed.  This comment from Veja magazine (August 6) was typical: 
"China spent 40 billion to do a facelift of the urban landscape and 
construct fabulous stadiums, but the great work is the social 
engineering to reform the hearts and minds of the population." 
 
D)  If there was an increased profile of Beijing during the 
Olympics, have businesses, civic groups, media, or government 
organizations changed their approach to dealing with China? 
 
It is not clear from reporting Mission has seen whether the media 
has "changed its approach" to China. 
 
E)  Have expectations of China's global role and position changed in 
the view of elites after the Games? 
 
Because of the level of exposure, expectations may have changed, 
although this is difficult to quantify.  Brazilian elites already 
see China as a major independent global player with whom they want 
to be associated, and the Olympics did nothing to diminish that view 
and might have strengthened it. 
 
¶2.  Additional examples of commentary on the Beijing Games: 
 
VEJA magazine - August 27 - Opening made in China. Life in a country 
where freedom arrived for the economy but only God knows when it 
will arrive in politics.  According to Veja, China wanted to break 
the record of medals and was successful. The Chinese also gave a 
show of competence and determination during the Olympics.  But the 
Chinese Communist Party is an incredible machine of social 
cooptation ever created: it changed China so that everything would 
remain the same.  In the letter to the reader, the editor notes that 
the reporter sent to do the coverage was surprised to see that 
foreign magazines are sold whose content about China was glued in by 
censors. He was also surprised with the people he met that show they 
are happy with the economic prosperity and indifferent to the 
political constraints. 
 
Epoca - June 23 - Epoca did a scene-setter for the Olympics. The 
reporter sent to do the special coverage said that she had already 
travelled to the other side of the world but it was "the first time 
that I travelled to another planet."  "I was surprised with the way 
the Chinese do not give you responses, with the delirious traffic, 
the working capacity, the exaggerated patriotism and the will to 
successes." 
 
Epoca - August 18 - Epoca highlights what it calls "Chinese Shadows" 
showing make-ups and disguises to fool the world such as: the 
"volunteers" were part of the Army or paramilitary; lack of freedom 
for the internet; volunteers called up to fill up empty seats; lack 
of freedom of speech, the "clean" air, and many other tricks to show 
that everything was impeccable.
