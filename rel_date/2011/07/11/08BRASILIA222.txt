REGARDING PROPOSED GUARULHOS PARKING FEE INCREASE 
 
REF: (A) BRASILIA 169; (B) BRASILIA 129; (C) STATE 3163 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On February 13, during a meeting with Brazilian Defense 
Minister Nelson Jobim primarily to discuss Jobim's March visit to 
Washington, the Ambassador raised the issue of the proposed aircraft 
parking fee increase at Sao Paulo's Guarulhos airport.  The measure 
was announced in December by national civil aviation agency ANAC and 
included a public comment period which elicited submissions from 
relevant stakeholders, including all four U.S. carriers.  The 
proposed fee increase would raise the fee 5200% for those aircraft 
parking at Guarulhos in excess of three hours.  While the measure 
would apply to all carriers, including Brazilian, it would create 
the greatest hardship for carriers from the U.S., Japan, and other 
nations who by necessity park the longest.  It also appears to 
violate Article 10 of our bilateral air services agreement in terms 
of being a "reasonable" fee increase. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ambassador explained that this issue was extremely 
important to U.S. companies, who are pressing for a resolution. 
Jobim indicated he was sensitive to the request from U.S. companies 
and said he was committed to resolving the issue.  He indicated that 
the GOB is looking at alternatives, and believed they would be ready 
to present them by the end of March. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In a separate meeting on February 14, ANAC Directors 
Marcelo Pacheco dos Guaranys and Andre Gomes de Barros told Econoff 
that it is not ANAC's intention to inhibit or decrease travel to and 
from Sao Paulo.  Initially the agency had thought airlines could 
feasibly fly to Rio from Sao Paulo (without passengers) to park and 
then fly back to Sao Paulo for their evening flights.  As a result 
of industry comments, they now understand the economic impact on the 
airlines.  While some fare increase is still on the table, the 
Directors indicated that the Ministry of Defense has commissioned 
studies from IATA regarding alternative solutions to Sao Paulo's 
infrastructure challenges.  Therefore, off the record, the Directors 
conceded that the original fee proposal likely will not go into 
effect March 16 as originally announced.  The government will need 
sufficient time to review the results of the IATA studies.
