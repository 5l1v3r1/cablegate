SUBJECT: Media Reaction - G-20 Finance Ministers' Meeting; Western 
Hemisphere:  Venezuela, Chvez; Sao Paulo; March 17, 2009 
 
Title- Lack of definitions in the G20 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-17) states: 
"Finance ministers from the G20 announced they are willing to do 
everything needed to fight the crisis and establish world economy 
growth but made few commitments as far as immediate action plans [in 
the preparation meeting that took place last weekend]....the deal 
related to the urgency of reinforcing the IMF's and other 
multilateral institution's cash was the most promising result of the 
meeting...." 
 
Title- Chavez expropriates opposition power in states 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Economico (3-17) says: "Since 
the opposition took over in five states and Caracas' city hall, 
Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez has been making systematic efforts 
to take away all the power they have....There are serious doubts 
whether Chavez will know how to face his challenges and re-orient 
the economy in an era of lower revenues and expenditures.  The 
president wisely prefers pyrotechnics and, at some point, they will 
not be sufficient to block the emergence of a severe economic 
crisis, which might be very expensive to him."
