SUBJECT: PROPOSED U.S. - SOUTH AMERICA BIOINFORMATION CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 77411 
 
¶1. (U)  Post delivered points as requested to Paulo Rogerio 
Goncalves, Director of International Affairs, Ministry of Science 
and Technology in Brazil regarding the U.S. proposal for a Brazil - 
South American Regional conference on Bioinformatics to be held in 
Brazil in November. Although Brazil's Minister for Science and 
Technology, Rezende, was traveling in Europe at the time, he 
received the proposal.  Now that Minister Rezende has returned to 
Brazil, Post has received the following response. 
 
¶2. (U)  The Brazilians were excited by the proposal, but the issue 
of timing will be key.  As you know the 14th Annual International 
Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology will be held 
in Fortaleza, Brazil, August 6-10, 2006, and many of the U.S. and 
regional scientists attending might also be invited to the proposed 
U.S.-Brazil event.  Minister Rezende's office is concerned that 
November might be too soon to expect these scientists to return 
again to Brazil. 
 
¶3.  They are offering three options: the first is to hold the 
U.S.-Brazil Regional conference on the margins of the Fortaleza 
event, although they admitted this option has drawbacks.  The second 
is to hold in November a U.S.-Brazil bilateral conference.  The 
third option is the hold the conference, as suggested by STAS, in 
March, 2007. 
 
¶4.  Post believes this conference holds exciting possibilities for 
both Brazil and the region looks forward to working with STAS on 
this endeavor.
