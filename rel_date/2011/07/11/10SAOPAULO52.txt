SUBJECT: SAO PAULO OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND LABOR SWEEP-JANUARY 2010 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: The following is the January edition of a monthly 
series summarizing human rights and labor developments in the Sao 
Paulo Consular District (i.e. the states of Sao Paulo, Parana, 
Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and Mato Grosso do Sul) not 
covered in broader reporting. 
 
 
 
LANDOWNERS WIN INJUNCTION ON DEMARCATION OF INDIGENOUS LANDS 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) Between December 22 and January 21, President of the Supreme 
Court Gilmar Mendes temporarily suspended the implementation of a 
December 2009 presidential decree to create nine indigenous 
reserves covering five million hectares of land in Amazonas, Para, 
Parana, Roraima and Mato Grosso do Sul.  The decision is based on a 
case involving five ranches in the municipality of Paranhos, Mato 
Grosso do Sul(MS) State.  The ranches are located on land 
traditionally belonging to the Arroio-Kor???? indigenous community 
and 
together they account for 94 percent of the approximately 7,100 
hectares of traditional Arroio-Kor???? land in MS.  In his decision, 
Mendes stated that the ranchers' arguments -- that their right to 
due process had been violated and that the titles for the ranches, 
which date from the 1920s, showed legal ownership of the land -- 
met the burden of proof to issue a temporary injunction.  The 
ranchers claim that President Lula ignored the existence of 
judicial actions already underway when he issued the 2009 decree. 
In reality, they argue, demarcation is the responsibility of the 
Congress.  Indigenous representatives say they will appeal the 
injunction as they consider the ranches part of their ancestral 
lands.  It is unknown when a final decision on the case can be 
expected. 
 
 
 
GOB AMNESTY LEGALIZES THOUSANDS OF BOLIVIANS IN SAO PAULO 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) According to Brazil's latest amnesty law (June 2009), 
illegal immigrants who entered Brazil before February 1, 2009 had 
until December 30, 2009 to regularize their status by registering 
with the Federal Police.  According to the GOB, a total of 41,816 
people received amnesty under the new law.  This was the third 
amnesty for illegal immigrants granted by the Brazilian government. 
The others took place in 1988 and 1998.  The latest amnesty 
affected various immigrant groups.  The largest group of 
beneficiaries came from Bolivia, 17,000 legalized (16,300 of them 
coming from Sao Paulo state).  They were followed by Chinese 
(5,500), Peruvians (4,600), Paraguayans (4,100)and Koreans (1,100). 
In addition, approximately 2,400 Europeans legalized their status. 
There were no reports of U.S. citizens requesting amnesty.  Interim 
Minister of Justice Luis Paulo Barreto publicly presented the 
legalization as a human rights issue to rescue illegal immigrants 
from "a clandestine environment where they are susceptible to labor 
and sexual exploitation."  The Brazilian Congress is now 
considering a new law concerning foreigners that would remove the 
need for periodic immigration amnesties. 
 
 
 
FIRST AFRO-BRAZILIAN RELIGION MEETING IN RIO GRANDE DO SUL 
 
 
 
¶4. (U) On January 26-29, Rio Grande do Sul State (RS) will host a 
conference entitled "The First National Meeting of 
African-Descended Traditions and Health."  This will gather 
prominent Afro-Brazilian religious leaders who will discuss 
traditional medicine and discrimination-related issues.  The event 
is sponsored by National Network of Afro-Religions and Health, the 
religious community Ile Ax???? Iyemoja Omi Olodo, the Congregation in 
the Defense of Afro-Brazilian Religions of RS, and the Catholic 
University of RS with the support of the Ministry of Health. 
 
WATER PROJECT IN QUILOMBO COMMUNITIES 
 
 
 
¶5. (U) The Sao Paulo State Land Institute Foundation (ITESP) 
recently began a project to improve access to water for four 
quilombo communities in the Valle do Ribeira region of the state: 
Andr???? Lopes (Eldorado), Nhunguara (Iporanga), Mandira 
(Canan????ia) 
and Morro Seco (Iguape).  Valle do Ribeira has many formally 
recognized quilombo communities.  The project costs approximately 
USD 108 million and the installation of seven water pumps will be 
finished in about two months benefitting 203 families.  In total, 
Sao Paulo State formally recognizes 26 quilombo communities.  ITESP 
provides each community with a state consultant, who offers 
training courses, manages infrastructure projects and serves as 
liaison between the communities and other state agencies to ensure 
and protect community rights.
