Title-Warm times after the end of the Cold War 
 
Op-ed in business oriented Valor Economico (4-20) by Sergio Leo 
states: "On the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas....a 
discrete political agreement marked the beginning of one more turn 
around in U.S. foreign policy promoted by Barack Obama: in a meeting 
between Brazil's Defense Minister, Nelson Jobim, Brazil's Foreign 
Policy Advisor to President Lula, Marco Aurelio Garcia, U.S. 
National Security Adviser General, Jim Jones, and the White House 
Special Advisor to Latin America, Dan Restrepo, they talked for more 
than one hour about the future of the region and the need to change 
the axle of the relationship between the U.S., Latin America and the 
Caribbean....the Brazilian government is making efforts to convince 
Obama's administration that the initiatives in the area of defense 
and the fight against drug trafficking taken by UNASUL [Union of 
South American Nations] are the best way to engage countries of the 
region to combat problems that worry U.S. anti-drugs and 
anti-terrorism authorities .  Obama's government seems to have 
received with satisfaction the message.....The solution for the 
collapse of the U.S. model in the fight against drug trafficking in 
the Hemisphere is an important piece in the dialogue between the 
U.S. and its neighbor countries, where the suspicion on this subject 
is high. ....The most evident thing at the Summit was the complete 
burial of the free trade agenda for the Hemisphere."
