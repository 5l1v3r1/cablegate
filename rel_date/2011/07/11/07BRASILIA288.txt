SUBJECT: TEDS VISIT BY REO SUCCESSFUL 
 
¶1.  On February 14-15 the Regional Environmental Officer (Hub) for 
South America traveled to Belem at the start of the shrimping season 
to work with the GOB inspectors as they conducted their annual 
pre-season TEDs verification check.  During the last Turtle Excluder 
Device (TEDs) verification visit by the Department of State and 
National Marine Fisheries Service in November and December, 2006, 
the US team had several concerns about the efficacy of the Brasilian 
TEDs program, in particular the level of training of the inspectors. 
 Efforts by DOS, NMFS, and the Regional Environmental Officer (Hub) 
for South America in providing training materials to these local 
inspectors resulted in an increased understanding of GOB TEDs 
regulations by the GOB inspectors and a program that is comparable 
in effectiveness to the U.S. program. 
 
¶2.  Vigilance and training are the cornerstones of effective TEDs 
programs in the United States as well as other countries.  Info 
addresses who wish to have copies of the training materials so that 
they can make them available to host government fisheries inspection 
and enforcement units should contact the regional environmental Hub 
in Brasilia.
