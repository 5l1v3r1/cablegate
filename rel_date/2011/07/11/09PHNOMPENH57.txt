His Excellency BARACK OBAMA 
President 
The United States of America

Excellency, 
 
On the very happy occasion of your inauguration as President of the 
United States of America, on behalf of the Royal Government and 
People of Cambodia, I have the great pleasure to extend to Your 
Excellency my most cordial congratulations and best wishes for your 
great success in your noble mission abroad. 
 
I firmly believe that your wise and broadminded leadership will 
bring about positive changes and development not only for the people 
of America, but also for other peoples around the globe.  I hope 
that, in the same token, the current relations of friendship and 
cooperation between Cambodia and the United States of America will 
be further developed.
