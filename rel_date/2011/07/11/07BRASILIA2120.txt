¶1.  (SBU)  Econoff and Poloff delivered reftel demarche on Monday, 
November 5 to Alexandre de Lima in the Division of Services, 
Investments and Financial Affairs (DSF) at the Ministry of External 
Relations (MRE), as a follow-up  on the demarche points sent to him 
on October 30.  De Lima, who will be a delegate to upcoming USG-GOB 
bilateral aviation discussions in early December, could not provide 
a clear response to any of the points.  He said that the GOB is 
"still studying" the information and that he "can't say whether they 
are ready to commit," but that he "doesn't think it will be that 
difficult."  He added that he would need to confer with experts at 
Brazil's civil aviation authority, ANAC, as well as another division 
of the MRE, and suggested a Tuesday, November 13 meeting to review 
their findings, but would not commit to a time. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  De Lima did not appear to feel the issue was urgent, 
noting that  it would not be raised until later on in the month-long 
ICAO session.  He also mentioned that another division at the MRE 
will be involved in the discussion:  COCIT, which deals with illegal 
trafficking issues.  (Comment:  in previous encounters, Post has 
found COCIT to be sensitive about matters of security cooperation. 
End Comment.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post will follow up with any additional details as they 
become available.  (Comment:  Brazil is currently  undergoing a 
complete shakeup of its civil aviation authority (septel).  This 
development may make additional information more difficult to 
obtain.  End Comment.)
