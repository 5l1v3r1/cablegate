¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The rate of deforestation of the Amazon Forest 
decreased 46% for the August 2008-July 2009 annual period compared 
to the previous 12-month period based on preliminary data released 
by the Brazilian National Space Research Institute (INPE).  The 
results of high-resolution satellite imagery should be released 
soon, and they are likely to show Amazon deforestation to be about 
7,000 square kilometers or less.  This would be the lowest 
deforestation rate since monitoring began in 1988.  This good news 
may have a modest, positive impact on Brazil's climate change 
negotiators by giving a boost to their confidence that the 
government could meet targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
from deforestation, which is the primary source of emissions from 
Brazil.  However, a sharp rise in the deforestation rate for July 
2009 - if it persists - could represent the beginning of a return to 
high rates.  END SUMMARY 
 
RECORD BREAKING DECLINE IN DEFORESTATION 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On September 1, the Brazilian National Space Research 
Institute (INPE) released the final monthly deforestation figure for 
the annual year ending July 31, which showed a dramatic 46% decrease 
for the year compared with the previous year.  The monthly figures 
come from the relatively low resolution DETER system, which relies 
on the MODIS satellite and the Chinese-Brazilian satellite (CBERS). 
The figures for the year from the relatively high resolution PRODES 
system using LANDSAT should come out later this month.  The more 
accurate PRODES figures tend to be about 50 percent greater than the 
annual figures using the DETER monthly numbers. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Environment Minister Carlos Minc announced that based on 
the results from the DETER system that the annual rate would be the 
lowest in two decades.  It is very likely that he is right.  Since 
Brazil began releasing annual deforestation figures in 1988, the 
annual figure has fluctuated between a high of nearly 30,000 square 
kilometers in the 12-month period ending July 31, 1995 to around 
11,000 square kilometers in 1991 and 2007.  Assuming the PRODES 
figure is roughly 50% larger than the 4,375 square kilometers DETER 
figure, then the annual rate should be about 7,000 square kilometers 
or less.  The DETER figure would have to be low by over 100% for the 
annual figure this year to break the 10,000 square kilometers mark, 
which would be remarkable. 
 
DISTURBING SPIKE IN JULY 
 
¶4.  (SBU) While the total for the year came in much lower than last 
year's, the monthly rate of deforestation shot up in July 2009. 
DETER found a total area of 836.5 square kilometers, which 
represents the highest number for the year and a rate that presented 
a 160% increased compared to the previous month.  Further, the July 
2009 figure was more than three times as high as that for July 2008. 
 Minister Minc said that July historically comes in with a high 
number because the cloud coverage lessens and the satellite can see 
deforestation from earlier months that had been obscured by clouds. 
"The deforestation had already taken place, but was not detected by 
the satellite images in the previous months due to the clouds that 
covered most of the area", he explained. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) COMMENT.  Minister Minc correctly points out that July 
tends to have less cloud coverage which allows DETER to tally 
earlier undetected deforestation.  However, the July report 
indicated that much of the deforestation detected in that month were 
in areas that had not been blocked by cloud coverage in earlier 
months.  This would suggest the deforestation took place in July 
itself and not earlier.  The sour note in the month of July - by 
itself - does not significantly detract from the overall positive 
news about a sharp decline for the annual period.  If this persists, 
then Brazil may be returning to an era of high deforestation rates. 
END COMMENT. 
 
POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR SHARP DECLINE 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Various factors contributed to the decline in the 
deforestation rate.  Minister Minc is categorical about the 
principal reason behind the decline in the deforestation rate.  He 
told the press, "90% of the decrease in deforestation rate took 
place due to law enforcement actions taken by the government."  The 
government has made numerous raids and thousands of seizures of 
illegal timber and cattle on illegally cleared land, he said. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Independent analysts have pointed out that the 
deforestation rate has historically been closely linked to the 
demand for beef and, to a lesser extent, soybeans.  The drop in 
demand for beef and soybeans associated with the economic crisis may 
have been a contributing factor in explaining the lower

deforestation rate, though it probably was not the dominant one 
because changes in commodity prices take time to have a major effect 
on farmer decision-making.  In addition, this 12-month period was a 
particularly rainy one, which would have impeded efforts to clear 
the forest through fire. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) COMMENT.  The good news about the sharp decline in the 
deforestation rate may have a spillover effect on the GOB's position 
in international negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC).  The GOB negotiators may now be more 
willing to accept binding or aspirational targets for reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions - or for reducing deforestation - now that 
they have had some success in this area.  Last year's rise in the 
deforestation rate compared with 2007 despite increased enforcement 
efforts likely surprised the GOB and undermined their confidence 
that they could agree to targets for reducing deforestation. 
Nonetheless, other powerful factors constraining the GOB 
negotiators, especially pressure from other G-77 countries not to 
agree to targets and avoiding possibly limiting economic growth, 
remain in place.  In sum, the good news on the deforestation will 
likely have a modest, positive effect on the GOB's negotiating 
position.  END COMMENT.
