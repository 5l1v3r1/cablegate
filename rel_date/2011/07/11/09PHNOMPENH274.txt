Â¶1. (SBU) Emboff delivered reftel talking points April 30 to Pen 
Thirong, First Deputy Director, Department of Investment and 
International Cooperation, Ministry of Economy and Finance.  Mr. Pen 
welcomed the G20 decision to support a 200 percent general capital 
increase at the Asia Development Bank (ADB).  He also acknowledged 
that from a technical point of view, it would be valuable for the 
ADB to make public the list of sanctioned companies and in fact the 
Royal Government of Cambodia has requested this list from ADB in the 
past.  Mr. Pen indicated that he would share our desire for stronger 
anti-corruption measures and safeguard standards at the ADB with his 
superiors.
