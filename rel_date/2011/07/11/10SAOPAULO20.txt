"Low transparency on Fighter Plane Decision" 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Econ????mico (1-11) states: 
"Stuck since the beginning of the decade, the fighter plane bid is 
running the risk of being postponed once more. ...[and] the low 
level transparency of the process [only] contributes to 
that....[Brazilian] society must be informed of how and why the 
country will spend more than R$10 billion in armaments. 
....Exchanging the expensive for the cheap requires convincing 
explanations for the good of a democracy that wants to be solid [in 
an allusion to Foreign Minister Amorim's comments that "sometimes 
the cheapest option, referring to Saab's proposal, ends up being 
the most expensive.]"
