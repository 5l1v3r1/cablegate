SUBJECT:  ZERO OVERSTAYS FOR EMPLOYEES OF MAJOR BRAZILIAN AIRLINE 
 
¶1. Summary:  A recent study of 1,349 non-immigrant visas (NIV) 
issued to employees of TAM Linhas Aereas S.A. (TAM) at Consulate 
General Sao Paulo in 2008 indicated that all individuals reviewed in 
the sample study returned to Brazil after their trips to the United 
States.  The results illustrate that employment with benefits, even 
with lower pay in Brazil, can be more appealing to a potential 
immigrant than the opportunity to earn more money in the United 
States.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. Consulate General Sao Paulo conducted a study of employees of 
Brazilian air carrier TAM to validate the high approval rate of 
their applications for tourist visas.  (Note: TAM is Brazil's 
largest air carrier with 49.8 percent market share of domestic 
flights and 85.1 percent of international flights.  End Note.)  The 
approval rate of the 1,367 TAM employees seeking visas in Sao Paulo 
in 2008 was 98.7 percent.  Adjudicating officers generally view TAM 
employees as good cases, although many earn salaries starting at 
approximately USD 1000 per month and could potentially earn more 
money working in the United States.  One key element of the profile 
of the TAM employees is that they all have a full benefits package. 
The most important parts of a full benefits package in Brazil 
include health insurance for the employee and the employee's family, 
pension benefits, and job security, since an employer has to pay a 
large sum to fire or dismiss any employees.  Consulate General Sao 
Paulo consistently adjudicates a high number of visas for TAM 
employees for two primary reasons: (1) many TAM employees work on 
international flights as flight attendants or pilots, and (2) TAM 
employees receive discounted fares for travel and frequently want to 
travel to the United States. 
 
Methodology 
 
¶3. During calendar year 2008, Consulate General Sao Paulo issued 
non-immigrant visas for 1,349 TAM employees.  The Fraud Prevention 
Unit (FPU) extracted data on the applications from the Consular 
Consolidated Database using the AdHoc Reporting Template.  The 
sample parameters were visas issued to TAM employees during calendar 
year 2008.  Using these criteria, FPU pulled the 1,349 issuances and 
entered them into an Excel Spreadsheet.  The applications were 
randomly sorted and 192 were selected using a sample interval of 
seven.  Based on the "Warsaw FPU Sample Size Calculator," a sample 
size of 192 would yield a standard error rate of less than three 
percent at a 95 percent confidence level, using a five percent 
estimated fraud rate. 
 
Results 
 
¶4. FPU ran each of the 192 selected applications against the 
Department of Homeland Security's Arrival-Departure Information 
System to determine whether and/or when the individual had traveled 
to the United States.  Of the 192 issuances, 122 (63.5 percent) were 
determined to have traveled and returned and 70 (36.5 percent) were 
determined not to have traveled.  Hence, there were no overstays in 
the sample study. 
 
¶5. Comment:  The absence of overstays for TAM employees validates 
the high approval rate for these applications.  The results may also 
illustrate that employment with benefits, even with lower pay in 
Brazil, can be more appealing to a potential immigrant than the 
opportunity to earn more money in the United States.  Post believes 
the benefits package received by TAM employees creates a strong 
incentive to return to Brazil.  Further, this type of benefits 
package for applicants from other Brazilian companies should be 
taken into consideration by adjudicating officers as one of the 
factors necessary to determine whether or not an applicant overcomes 
Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act.  End 
Comment.
