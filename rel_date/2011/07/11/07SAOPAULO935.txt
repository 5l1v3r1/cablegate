"A Risk For Mercosul" 
 
The leading editorial in center-right national circulation daily O 
Estado de S. Paulo (11/21) maintained: "Venezuela's Mercosul 
membership does not interest Brazil at the present moment. There is 
no economic or diplomatic justification to receive in the bloc the 
nation led by President Hugo Chvez.... There are more than 
sufficient reasons to refuse, under today's circumstances, 
Venezuela's claim to participate in the bloc. If, agreeing with 
President Lula's pressures, the [Brazilian] Congress approves 
Venezuela's admittance, it will be complicit in another serious 
foreign policy mistake.... Chvez has already declared that he wants 
to enter Mercosul to change it. He has not explained what these 
changes will be, and President Lula does not seem concerned with 
that.... What kind of association accepts on its board a partner who 
announces his intention to transform it according to his personal 
plans?.... It is irresponsible to evaluate Venezuela's Mercosul 
membership without considering its current president's projection of 
power and the possibility of a new regime being installed in that 
nation soon. It is not a matter of interfering in a neighboring 
nation's policy. It is a matter of prudently avoiding a Mercosul 
that accepts as a partner a nation that may soon be submitting 
itself to a strongly armed new regime capable of threatening 
regional stability."  White
