SUBJECT: Media Reaction Rio de Janeiro: Dubious and Risky Diplomatic 
Stance (Brazil-Iran) 
 
Dubious and risky diplomatic stance 
 
Rio-based center-left daily Jornal do Brasil writes: "And finally, 
to the displeasure of the international community and the protests 
of human rights organizations, President Lula received in Brasilia 
the controversial Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. (...) To 
Ahmadinejad, considered a persona non grata in almost the entire 
world (...) certainly the meeting represented a conquest. (...) To 
Lula, the visit was another opportunity to place Brazil as a 
conflict mediator no longer limited to South America. After being 
involved in the imbroglio in Honduras (...) the country is 
attempting to have a voice in the complex geopolitical context of 
the Middle East. In recent weeks, Lula also received the Presidents 
of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, and Israel, Shimon 
Peres. However, the meeting with Ahmadinejad was surprising due to 
the deference and friendly tone [of Lula towards Ahmadinejad] (...) 
It is a risky [diplomatic] stance and gives the impression of 
support, or at least the condoning of the thesis defended by the 
Iranian President... This is the man who has denied the Holocaust 
in World War II, who defends the annihilation of Israel and makes 
homophobic declarations (...) Obtained with fraud, Ahmadinejad's 
reelection weakened his legitimacy (...) His defiance of 
international regulations related to the non-proliferation of 
nuclear weapons, and in creating difficulties for the IAEA 
inspections, makes Ahmadinejad a threat to [reaching] a difficult 
solution in the Middle East conflict. In the meeting, Lula 
diplomatically supported the Iranian right to develop a nuclear 
program with "peaceful ends" at the same time that he highlighted 
the right to "a safe and sovereign Israeli state". In retribution, 
Ahmadinejad defended Brazil's bid to occupy a permanent seat on the 
U.N. Security Council. One should question how valid [relevant]this 
support is."  (Nov 25, page A8)
