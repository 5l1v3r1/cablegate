SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: HONDURAS ELECTIONS 
 
"Democracy for the Ballot-Box" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (11-25) says: 
"....During the entire Honduran crisis, the Brazilian government 
has only got in the way....In Brazil's Foreign Ministry, as one 
could expect, this change in the [U.S.] stance [towards the 
Honduran election] upset people.  The main argument is that 
acknowledging the November 29th presidential elections will 
consecrate the coup.  But what they are not considering is that 
free and clean elections are a legitimate way of leaving anomalous 
regimes.....The Brazilian government doesn't seem to be willing to 
listen to the voice of reason.  It also does not seem to give 
importance to what Hondurans think and say....Furthermore, in Latin 
America there is no longer the consensus that President Lula had 
referred to.  At least four countries will acknowledge the results 
of the elections."
