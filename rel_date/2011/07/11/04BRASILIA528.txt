¶1.  The Brazilian Senate on March 4 approved the new energy 
model with some changes sought by the energy sector.  The 
most favorable change pertains to the definition of "new 
energy" and "old energy," a point that determines to which 
of two energy pools power plants must sell.  The bill as 
passed by the lower chamber mandated that any generation 
plant in operation before January 1, 2003 would have to 
compete in "old energy" auctions with plants that had 
already been amortized, i.e., on a less favorable footing. 
The Senate version pushed back the date to January 1, 2000, 
helping the majority of plants which started construction 
after privatization in 1998.  This change would allow 29 
hydroelectric plants and 19 thermoelectric plants to compete in new energy auctions that would be considered "old energy" in the lower-chamber version. 
 
¶2.  However, even the bill passed on March 4 may not prove 
to be the final Senate-approved version.  Reflecting a 
peculiarity of Brazil's legislative process, there will be 
further separate Senate votes on a series of extra 
amendments to the bill.  Neither the number nor the nature 
of these amendments are publicly known, but they evidently 
represent private industry representatives' last shot at 
inserting what they have described as essential changes for 
the survival of adequate conditions for sector investment. 
 
¶3.  The big losers in the new energy model as passed by the 
Senate so far are the distributors.  Tariffs are to be based on auction prices, and the distributors will not be allowed to pass on all of their costs to the consumers.  Also on the losing side were the opponents of the energy-model's prohibition of "self-dealing" (direct energy sales from generation to distribution operations of vertically 
integrated companies.) 
 
¶4.  The Senate-passed version now must go back to the 
Chamber of Deputies for the latter to consider its new 
provisions.  Separately, the Senate is scheduled to vote 
Tuesday, March 9 on the further amendments, as well as 
separately on Presidential Decree 145 (specific legislation 
to create an Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica (EPE), the data 
collection body akin to the United States Energy Information 
Agency.)
