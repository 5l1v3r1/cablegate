¶1.  SUMMARY.  In July 2009, a USAID and NSF-sponsored workshop 
brought together U.S. and Peruvian experts on climate change impacts 
on highland mountain zones and they identified six major weaknesses 
impeding the development and implementation of adaptation 
strategies.  These weaknesses included the lack of adequate 
information on climate change and water resources in Peru and the 
lack of funding for mid and long term adaptation strategies. 
USAID/Peru has committed USD 1 million to implement over the next 
three years some of the recommendations made by the working groups 
formed at this workshop.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  The recession of tropical glaciers has an enormous impact on the 
Andean hydrologic cycle, a situation that raises grave concerns for 
future water resources - especially in Peru where 70% of the 
population lives on the Pacific coast and only 2% of the country's 
water supply is available.  The anticipated increase and risk of 
increased flooding, catastrophic events, and loss of water storage 
will likely force major changes upon Andean communities.  In 
response, USAID sponsored an international, multidisciplinary, 
inter-sectoral, and university-based workshop in Lima and Huaraz, 
Peru, entitled "Adapting to a World without Glaciers."  This 
workshop was designed to facilitate discussion among scientists, 
practitioners, and policy makers about climate change 
vulnerabilities and risks; catalyze thinking that formulates 
innovative approaches that facilitate adaptation to changing 
environmental and climatic conditions; and identify priority 
research, collaboration, and action needs.  Besides USAID 
(Washington and Peru), the workshop was also supported by the 
National Science Foundation, the International Resources Group 
(IRG), , The Mountain Institute, University of Georgia, Catholic 
University of Peru, Peru's Science and Technology Council 
(CONCYTEC), and Peru's Ministry of Environment. 
 
¶3.  Throughout the workshop (July 7-15, 2009) recommendations and 
concrete plans for future collaborative research and development 
projects between U.S and Peruvian scientists were elaborated and 
prioritized through dialogue with government officials and Peruvian 
researchers.  USAID/Peru committed to investing USD 1 million over 
the next three years to implement the research and action priorities 
recommended throughout this workshop. 
 
¶4.  The workshop was a rare opportunity to increase collaborative 
exchange between U.S. scientists and Peruvian researchers on 
challenges related to climate change adaptation, water resources 
management, biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, and 
agricultural practices. 
 
RESEARCH PROPOSALS 
 
¶5.  The workshop created three working groups that dealt with: water 
and hazards, ecosystem and biodiversity, and agriculture.  Proposals 
for research on the processes and impacts of climate change in 
Peru's water sector include: 1) determining (natural and artificial) 
water availability; 2) determining current and future uses of water; 
and 3) evaluating past and current water management practices.  For 
ecosystems and biodiversity, research priorities are: 1) identifying 
vulnerable communities and areas; 2) understanding how people value 
biodiversity and ecosystems from a cultural and economic perspective 
and study interactions between human and biophysical systems; and 3) 
understanding social, cultural, economic, and environmental links 
between high and lowlands.  For the agricultural sector, research 
needs include: 1) evaluating changes in land use, vegetation cover, 
 
BRASILIA 00000963  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
and productive ecosystems due to climate change; 2) recovering and 
reassessing traditional knowledge on climate change, with 
representation of the country's cultural diversity; and 3) 
evaluating current and potential capacities of sub-basins as 
suppliers of environmental services.  These recommendations will 
inform the development of a research agenda by CONCYTEC and may lead 
to further research support from the US National Science 
Foundation. 
 
PRIORITY ACTIONS 
 
¶6.  Priority actions for climate change adaptation in Peru's water 
sector are: 1) develop and strengthen platforms for participation 
and decision-making by stakeholders in the water basins; 2) capacity 
building and information exchange for participation and 
decision-making; and 3) education, communication, and information 
dissemination (i.e. improve communication and education on climate 
change).  With respect to ecosystems and biodiversity, suggested 
priority actions are: 1) biodiversity and ecosystem conservation and 
management; 2) strengthen public awareness on impact of climate 
change on ecosystems and biodiversity; and 3) improve, implement, 
and develop new policies and environmental laws with respect to 
biodiversity conservation and environmental services.  For the 
agricultural sector, suggested priorities are: 1) strengthen 
governmental institutions - namely the ministries of Environment 
(MINAM) and Agriculture (MINAG), Meteorology and Hydrology Service 
(SENAHMI), Agricultural Research Institution (INIA), and 
Agricultural Health Service (SENASA) - in order to carry out more 
effective actions in response to climate change; 2) develop and 
implement a National Program for Intercultural Education on Climate 
Change; and 3) elaborate and implement mechanisms for the mandatory 
payment of environmental services.  These recommendations will 
inform the follow on work sponsored by USAID/Peru. 
 
BARRIERS TO DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ADAPTION STRATEGIES 
 
¶7.  Six main points that impede the development  and the 
implementation of strategies to adapt to these changes were 
identified throughout the event: 1) Lack of sufficient information 
and research on climate change and water (e.g. studies on 
paleoclimate and climate history); 2) weak institutional structure 
in Peru in general and in the agricultural sector in particular 
(i.e. lack of cooperation between governmental agencies and need for 
a governmental, multisectoral data base on climate change); 3) gap 
between society in general and indigenous and native communities 
(i.e. difficulty in incorporating traditional knowledge into 
official strategies for climate change adaptation); 4) indigenous 
and native populations are losing control over their natural 
resources and their capacity to manage their territories (i.e. 
increased dependence on outside organizations); 5) gap between the 
scientific community, decision makers, and society as a whole (e.g. 
data is seldom shared publicly and free of charge); and 6) lack of 
funding for mid and long term adaptation strategies. 
 
¶8.  Peru is currently developing a series of initiatives that will 
strengthen the country's capacity to support research on climate 
change and implement actions to adapt to these changes.  Some 
highlights are the creation of a Ministry of Environment, the 
elaboration of a new law for water resource management and risk 
management, and growing interest of local authorities in 
incorporating environmental policies into their regions.  The 
existence of national protected areas and the country's current 
attempt to motivate the creation of private protected areas 
 
BRASILIA 00000963  003.2 OF 003 
 
 
strengthen Peru's capacity to conserve biodiversity.  NOTE: During 
his speech at the event, Minister of Environment Antonio Brack, 
highlighted the need for international researchers working in Peru 
to share information with Peruvian entities and increased 
participation from local communities in decision-making.  The new 
water resources management law was criticized by other event 
participants for not involving local communities in its elaboration 
and for looking at Peru as a homogeneous country (which it is not). 
END NOTE. 
 
¶9.  COMMENT.  This USAID-funded workshop and the commitment by 
USAID/Peru to support follow up activities have visibly demonstrated 
the USG's interest in and concern about the impact of receding 
glaciers in the Andeans.  This environmental problem represents a 
major challenge to the region for the millions that depend on the 
glaciers for the water supply.  END COMMENT.
