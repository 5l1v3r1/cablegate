¶1.  (SBU) This report provides an update on developments in Brazil 
regarding the swine flu outbreak. 
 
NEW REPORTED CASES: 
 
¶2.  (SBU) As of the afternoon of May 22, the Brazilian Ministry of 
Health has confirmed nine cases of the H1N1 flu in Brazil.  A new 
case - the ninth altogether - was confirmed in Sao Paulo earlier 
this week.  The nine cases are spread throughout five of Brazil's 26 
states and the Federal District: Sao Paulo (3 cases); Rio de Janeiro 
(3 cases); Minas Gerais (1 case); Santa Catarina (1); and Rio Grande 
do Sul (1 case).  The ministry and health officials are 
investigating another 14 suspected cases of infection in 8 different 
states. 
 
BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT'S RECENT ACTIONS: 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In recent weeks the Ministry of Health has become more 
outspoken in expressing its desires to ensure that information, 
technology, and any potential vaccines related to the H1N1 virus are 
shared openly among all member nations of the World Health 
Organization (WHO).  The Brazilian Government believes that this 
information should be considered a public good.  Health Minister 
Jose Temporao has also insisted that the WHO organize a 
information-sharing system for both public and private health 
institutions that decentralizes access to information on influenza 
viruses, testing equipment and samples, especially for developing 
countries. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Temporao expressed this idea when he addressed the World 
Health Assembly in Geneva.  He also encouraged WHO members to engage 
in open and transparent negotiations in order to establish a set of 
formal rules governing methods of equal dissemination.  Afterwards, 
Temporao met with delegates from France, South Africa, Thailand, 
Norway, Indonesia, and Senegal to discuss how these countries could 
cooperate on these issues.
