¶1.  (C)  With the June 10 submission of Boeing's best and 
final offer for Brazil's four billion dollar FX2 fighter 
competition, it is now up to Brazil's government to decide on 
an aircraft.  A decision from the National Defense Council 
(President Lula and key Ministers) is expected at the 
beginning of August.  Based on feedback received from Air 
Force sources, Boeing believes that it leads in terms of 
technical evaluations and is working with the U.S. Congress 
on a solution to Brazil's financing concerns (ref c).  Once 
the Brazilian Air Force completes its technical evaluation of 
the proposals, its recommendation will be forwarded to the 
political leadership by July 12, where intensive high-level 
lobbying from Boeing's competitors have left the Super Hornet 
at a disadvantage.  To counter this and remove any lingering 
doubts about USG backing for Boeing's proposal, post 
recommends the following urgent steps: 
 
--  The single most important action to maximize the chances 
success will be for President Obama to raise the sale with 
President Lula at the G8/G5 Summit in Italy.  Lula will have 
the final decision, and the President's strong relationship 
with him could prove decisive. 
 
--  Secretary Clinton could call Foreign Minister Amorim to 
highlight the importance of the sale for strengthening our 
partnership with Brazil and the long term benefits to both 
economies. 
 
--  Secretary Gates could call Defense Minister Jobim to 
underline the importnace of the sale and the benefits for 
Brazil's defense industry to a lartnership with Boeing.  This 
call should take place before Jobim departs to spend most of 
July on vacation in France. 
 
--  There is still doubt within the Air Force that the State 
Department wil ultimately agree to the transfer of technology 
as proposed by Boeing.  Under Secretary Burns gave verbal 
assurances of this to visiting Brazilian legislators June 2, 
but these have not reached the Air Force, whose commander, 
Brig. Saito has asked for such written assurances previously. 
 A letter from Burns restating these points would remove any 
remiening doubts. 
 
¶2.  (C)  While these efforts are underway, post also 
recommends that the advocacy letter currently being developed 
be completed and forwarded to Brazil to complement the above 
steps.  Given the importance of personal contacts to 
Brazilians, the letter by itself is not enough, but it will 
give substantial evidence of USG support for the sale. 
 
¶3.  (C)  There has been an intense, coordinated French 
government lobbying effort.  President Sarkozy has raised the 
sale several times with Lula.  The French Minister of Defense 
and Presidential Military Advisor have established a direct 
line of communications (without going through the French 
Embassy) with Jobim.  Jobim was recently wined and dined 
extensively at the Paris Air Show and has accepted an 
invitation to be an official guest of the French MOD at 
Bastille Day.
