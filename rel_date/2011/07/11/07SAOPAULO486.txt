¶1. "Bush's Move To Combat Global Warming" 
 
Business-oriented Valor Economico (6/5) editorialized: "The fight 
against global warming may have gained an important - although 
exceptional - ally: the U.S..... What remains to be seen is whether 
Bush entered the game with a diversionary maneuver with dilatory 
effects or if the U.S. has finally decided to engage in the world 
effort.... The new U.S. posture, however, maintains in its intent 
the unilateralist aspect of the Bush administration.... Bush's 
proposal opposes not only the spirit of the Kyoto Protocol, but also 
that of any global agreement.  The U.S. has been sufficiently 
ambiguous to leave in limbo the possibility of any mandatory limit 
on emissions jointly established by other nations. By trying to look 
for a solution just among the world's 15 main polluters, Bush wants 
to discuss the matter outside the United Nations' range.... But the 
simple acceptance by the U.S. that the problem exists may set in 
motion a dynamic that will force Bush to take further positive 
steps." 
 
¶2. "Chvez and Lula" 
 
Liberal, largest national circulation daily Folha de S. Paulo's 
Caracas correspondent Fabiano Maisonnave commented (6/5): "Chvez's 
unprecedented decision to refuse to renew RCTV's concession has made 
clear that a significant portion of the international community will 
make him pay a very high price. On the other hand, Chvez's 
immoderate reaction showed to the world that he is willing to pay 
for it. If it will become increasingly difficult to coexist with 
Chvez on the international stage, for the Venezuelan opposition it 
will be almost intolerable.... Meanwhile, according to President 
Lula's pragmatism, an interference in Venezuela's 'internal affairs' 
is only justifiable to help Chvez, as was the case with Lula's 
visit in November, a few days before the presidential elections in 
that nation.... There are strong motives for Lula to act like that. 
Brazilian contractors led by Odebrecht, which donated funds for his 
reelection campaign, are increasingly profiting from Chvez's 
petrodollars - Brazil is already Venezuela's second trade partner, 
after the U.S.  These are the interests the GOB wants to preserve, 
no matter if to do so it is necessary to sacrifice dear topics such 
as freedom of expression."
