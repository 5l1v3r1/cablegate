SUBJECT: PARAGUAY TOWS BRAZILIAN LINE ON MERCOSUR - ECUADOR 
STATEMENT 
 
Classified By: Political Chief James P. Merz for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d 
). 
 
¶1.  (U)  On April 21, Paraguay, in its capacity as temporary 
President of Mercosur, issued a statement calling upon the 
"political and social forces of Ecuador to preserve 
democracy" and seek a peaceful solution to the crisis 
occurring in that country.  According to the press, 
Paraguay,s statement 1) recalled the Protocolo de Ushuaia -- 
the declaration that articulates the democratic principles to 
which Mercosur members subscribe -- which excludes partners 
in the event of a rupture with democracy and 2) affirmed that 
Mercosur would support the approach of the recently created 
South American Community of Nations. 
 
¶2.  (C)  FM Leila Rachid confided to the Ambassador on April 
21 that Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim had insisted 
that the Mercosur statement refer to the "South American 
Community of Nations" (SACN) and not to the Inter-American 
Democratic Charter.  She argued against the idea because the 
SACN is merely a gleam in the eye at this point; it was 
announced as a proposal last year but it lacks structure, a 
set of guiding principles agreed to by members and any other 
normal characteristics of "institutionalization."  Amorim 
prevailed, however, because she suspected Duarte Frutos would 
not back her if she resisted (subject of a septel). 
 
¶3.  (C) Rachid noted that Amorim said he wanted no mention of 
the Inter American Democratic Charter because that would be 
an invitation for the OAS, and therefore the U.S., to 
"meddle" in "regional" (i.e., South American) issues that "we 
should be taking care of ourselves in the region."  She added 
the personal comment that Amorim is pushing an agenda 
designed to minimize U.S. influence in South America and 
assert Brazilian dominance, a course she strongly opposes 
because it translates into unfettered Brazilian control of 
Paraguay's destiny.
