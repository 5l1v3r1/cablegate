SUBJECT: CAMBODIAN RESPONSE ON NORTH KOREAN REFUGEES 
 
REF: A. A) SEOUL 3600 
     ¶B. B) STATE 174223 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Chief Margaret McKean; Reason:  1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
 ¶1.  (C)  In response to reftel demarche, Pol/Econ Chief 
raised the North Korean refugee issue with MFA Secretary of 
State Long Visalo on October 19.  Visalo said that he would 
provide the copy of reftel non-paper to the Minister and 
brief him on the USG request.  On the question of sensitivity 
to Cambodia's relationship with North Korea, Visalo offered 
that former King Sihanouk had a historic relationship with 
Pyongyang, but the current Cambodian government does not have 
significant ties.  The MFA official expressed concern over 
the prospect of undocumented North Koreans crossing into 
Cambodia from neighboring countries, but nevertheless 
promised that he would discuss the matter with FM Hor Namhong 
and provide the Embassy with a response. 
 
¶2.  (C)  On October 20, the Ambassador and Pol/Econ Chief met 
on a separate issue with PM advisor Om Yentieng, and also 
provided him with a copy of the non-paper.  P/E Chief 
explained the USG proposal; Om Yentieng responded that the 
processing of North Koreans that takes place in Cambodia is 
the result of an understanding reached between the Prime 
Minister and the South Korean Ambassador to Cambodia.  Like 
Long Visalo, he also dismissed concern over the sensitivity 
of the issue in terms of North Korean-Cambodian bilateral 
relations.  However, he did register some concern over the 
PM's safety due to the proximity of the North Korean Embassy 
(which is next door) to the PM's residence -- should USG-RGC 
cooperation on North Korean refugees become public knowledge. 
 Given the South Korean Embassy's interest in the matter, Om 
Yentieng offered that the RGC would need to consult with the 
South Korean government and factor the ROK's concerns into a 
final decision.  The PM advisor noted that Cambodia does not 
distinguish between a North and South Korea per se, but views 
Koreans as one people.  He added that the PM is sensitive to 
the plight of the North Koreans, given Hun Sen's personal 
experience of having to seek shelter outside his own country 
during the Khmer Rouge period. 
 
¶3.  (U)  The Embassy will report any further discussions of 
RGC response to our demarche request.
