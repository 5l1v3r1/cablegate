REF:  State 57716 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On April 30, EconOff presented demarche points in reftel 
to Joao Storti and Renato Pinheiro of the Ministry of External 
Relations' Intellectual Property Rights Division and to Andre 
Barcellos, Executive Secretary of the National Council Against 
Piracy (CNCP). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The GOB officials expressed appreciation for USG 
recognition of the progress made by the GOB in its fight against IPR 
piracy, with Barcellos noting that this was another indication of 
the maturation of U.S. - Brazilian relations.  He added that the GOB 
places a high priority on fighting piracy because it realizes that 
it is in Brazil's best interests to do so. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Pinheiro said the new designation was welcome news and 
reflected a constructive level of bi-lateral cooperation.  In 
reference to the threatened compulsory licensing issue with Merck, 
he said the GOB has not made a final decision and he felt both sides 
could still reach a negotiated solution.  He noted that the issue 
for the GOB was the financial ability to sustain its ongoing HIV 
program.
