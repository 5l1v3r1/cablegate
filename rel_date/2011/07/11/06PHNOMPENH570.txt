SUBJECT:  CONFIRMED BIRD FLU DEATH IN CAMBODIA 
 
 
¶1.  Cambodia's Ministry of Health, together with the World 
Health Organization and the Pasteur Institute, has confirmed 
that a three-year-old girl died March 21 from avian 
influenza.  The girl, who lived in the Kong Pisey district 
of Kampong Speu province, about 30 miles west of Phnom Penh, 
had reportedly been playing with sick birds a few days 
before she became ill with a fever on March 14.  Her 
condition deteriorated rapidly on March 20 and she was taken 
to Kantha Bopha Hospital in Phnom Penh, where she died the 
next day.  The Ministry has not yet released the girl's name 
nor the name of the village where she lived. 
 
¶2.  According to Dr. Sirenda Vong, the CDC-trained head of 
epidemiology at the Pasteur Institute, the Pasteur Institute 
laboratory confirmed last night that the child had been 
infected with avian influenza.  The Pasteur Institute will 
send samples to the WHO collaborating center laboratory in 
Hong Kong for further testing. 
 
¶3.  A Ministry of Health/Pasteur Institute/WHO team is 
currently investigating the case.  A check of area hospitals 
revealed no other patients suffering from symptoms and 
exposure patterns consistent with avian influenza.  During a 
door to door village survey, the team identified 42 contacts 
and took samples from each.  The investigation team is 
monitoring seven people:  four individuals with mild fevers 
who had contact with the infected child and three other 
people with mild symptoms who had contact with poultry that 
had died near the village.  Laboratory results from the 
suspected cases are expected to be available early next 
week.  Villagers have told the team that there was a bird 
die-off in the village in February and March. 
 
¶4.  Post's CDC office will remain in close contact with the 
investigation team and is prepared to provide technical 
assistance, if requested.
