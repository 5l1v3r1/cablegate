SUBJECT: THAI PM SURAYUD PROMISES CONTINUITY TO CAMBODIA 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Thai interim Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont's 
one-day visit to Phnom Penh October 15 was intended to 
reassure the Cambodian government of Thailand's stability and 
that the Thai government (RTG) would continue to strengthen 
ties between the two countries despite the change in 
government following the September 19 coup, according to the 
Thai Embassy.  Thai Embassy Poloff Songchai Chaipatiyut told 
Pol/EconOff October 17 that the theme of Surayud's visit was 
continuity.  Songchai said General Surayud briefed Cambodian 
leaders, including Prime Minister Hun Sen, on the current 
political situation in Thailand and promised to continue 
joint Thai-Cambodian projects. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Specifically, Surayud committed to continuation of 
Thai projects to repair the road from Siem Reap through An 
Long Veng to the Thai border at Chong Sangam in Sisaket and 
four bridges along the road from Koh Kong in southwestern 
Cambodia to Trat.  He proposed increased cooperation in 
combating the spread of avian influenza in the region. 
Songchai said that Surayud agreed to continue talks on 
revenue sharing of petroleum in the Overlapping Claims Area 
in the Gulf of Thailand.  However, Surayud has moved 
responsibility for the issue back to the Thai MFA from the 
Ministry of Energy.  The Cambodians, he said, asked Surayud 
to open two additional border checkpoints, one near Preah 
Vihear in northern Cambodia and a new checkpoint near the 
overcrowded border crossing at Poipet/Aranyaprathet.  Surayud 
reportedly responded that the RTG would have to follow 
internal procedures for evaluating the RGC proposals before 
making a decision. 
 
¶3.  (U) Accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister/Finance Minister 
Pridiyathorn Devakula and Foreign Minister Nitya 
Pibulsonggram,  Surayud paid courtesy calls on National 
Assembly President Heng Samrin and Senate President Chea Sim. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Songchai commented that there appeared to be a 
great difference in style between Surayud and former Prime 
Minister Thaksin.  When Thaksin traveled, he always brought 
along a large entourage, including many Cabinet Ministers. 
Surayud had a small party and only two Ministers.  More 
importantly, Thaksin's visits generally mixed official and 
private business (IT and satellite) concerns.  Even former 
Foreign Minister Surakiart, who was a former member of PTT's 
board of directors, included business interests in his 
visits.  In contrast, Surayud ties were not with business, 
but with the military, including the former resistance 
forces, when as a Special Operations officer he worked with 
the Cambodian resistance against the Vietnamese occupation. 
Songchai noted that Surayud's first congratulatory message 
from Cambodians on his appointment was from FUNCINPEC 
President Ranariddh, followed by former FUNCINPEC resistance 
General Nhek Bunchhay, although the government was quick to 
offer its congratulations, as well.  Lastly, Songchai noted 
that Surayud knew sufficient Khmer that he generally 
understood Hun Sen's remarks, though Surayud responded in 
Thai.
