SUBJECT:  2008 Report on Investment Disputes and Expropriation 
Claims for Cambodia 
 
REF:  STATE 43784 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  The Cambodian Constitution and laws protect against 
expropriation, except confiscation in the public interest.  When 
property is seized in the public interest, just compensation is 
required.  Post is not aware of property being taken from U.S. 
persons by the Cambodian government through June 1, 2008.  However, 
Post is aware of several incidents reported in the media of the 
government expropriating property from Cambodian nationals without 
just compensation.  End Summary. 
 
No Investment Disputes or Expropriation Claims Reported 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶2.  Article 44 of the Cambodian Constitution says "the (state's) 
right to confiscate properties from any person shall be exercised 
only in the public interest as provided for under the law and shall 
require fair and just compensation in advance."  The Law on 
Investment also provides that "the Royal Government of Cambodia 
shall not undertake a nationalization policy which adversely affects 
the private property of investors." 
¶3.  Cambodian laws are not uniformly applied and enforcement is 
often biased towards individuals with connections to the government. 
 However, Post is not aware of any investment disputes or 
expropriation claims involving U.S. persons and the Cambodian 
government through June 1, 2008. 
¶4.  Post is aware of many cases reported in the media wherein the 
Cambodian government granted land concessions under opaque 
circumstances to private companies.  This type of concession on 
property of contested ownership is increasingly common and has 
resulted in disputes throughout the country, which Post tracks for 
its human rights and rule-of-law reporting.
