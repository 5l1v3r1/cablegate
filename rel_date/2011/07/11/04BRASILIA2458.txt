Classified By: Deputy Economic Counselor J. Andrew Plowman, reasons 1.4 
 (b) and (d). 
 
(S) Emboff delivered Reftel prenotification of USG intent to 
nominate Jama'at Al-Tawhid wa'al-Jihad (JTJ) to the UNSC 1267 
list to Luiza Lopes da Silva of the Foreign Ministry's Office 
for the Combat of Illicit International Activities and to 
Jaime Freitas, the number two in Brazil's Financial 
Intelligence Unit (COAF).  Freitas undertook to search COAF's 
databases and share the list with relevant GoB entities that 
work with COAF, including the Central Bank and intelligence 
agency (ABIN), for them to conduct similar searches.  Emboff 
pointed out to Lopes da Silva that the GoB should have a 
particular interest in this case since JTJ and al-Zarqawi had 
claimed responsibility for the killing of Brazilian diplomat 
and UN envoy Sergio Viera de Mello.  Da Silva promised to 
follow up.
