SUBJECT: The State of Rio de Janeiro's Biodiesel Program 
 
 
¶1.  Summary.  In terms of monetary support for biodiesel, the 
state of Rio de Janeiro is out in front of the Brazilian federal 
government.  The Rio State program includes research, tax breaks, 
and production support, combined with more ambitious targets in 
terms of the percentage of biodiesel mixed into regular diesel 
than that required by federal authorities.  Mission believes that 
joint activities on biodiesel might be a possible subject of 
bilateral cooperation between Brazilian government entities (both 
state and federal) and USDOE.  End Summary. 
 
State Support for Biodiesel 
--------------------------- 
¶2.  The conventional thinking here is that biodiesel, which can 
cost upwards of double the price of petroleum diesel (this would 
depend on the vegetable oil used as well as the current price of 
petroleum), will only be widely used if the Brazilian government 
subsidizes its price.  The Rio state government has an active 
biodiesel effort "RioBiodiesel."  In 2003, the German government 
made a comparative analysis between Rio's and Germany's 
biodiesel, Rio's biodiesel coming out on top, having fewer 
tryglicerides in the mix than the German biodiesel (the German's 
have since addressed this issue).  The state is not only involved 
in research on biodiesel, but will also play an important role in 
its production.  The State's Agricultural Secretariat has set 
aside 500 hectares in the northern part of the state for growing 
castor oil plants, along with sunflowers, to be used in producing 
biodiesel.  The goal for 2008 is to set aside 20,000 hectares. 
The State of Rio has already invested approximately USD 60,000 in 
the construction of two semi-pilot castor oil facilities for the 
production of vegetable oil for biodiesel in the municipalities 
of Itaocara and Campos. 
 
¶3.  Comment.  The choice of Itaocara and Campos for semi-pilot 
castor oil facilities does not appear to have been based on 
agronomic suitability.  Castor bean and sunflower production can 
be expected to be marginal on the humid tropical lowland soils of 
the northern part of Rio State where sugar cane cultivation 
predominates.  The State Agricultural Secretariat faces the 
daunting challenge of developing producer incentives and 
introducing new crop technologies to poor farmers in this region, 
prior to state and federal science officials being able to go to 
scale with ambitious plans for biodiesel production.  End 
Comment. 
 
¶4.  Meanwhile, Rio State reportedly will invest R$6 million 
(approximately USD 2.7 million) in infrastructure to implement 
production units of Biodiesel in the cities of Campos, Resende, 
Duque de Caxias and in the city of Rio.  This money will come 
from Brazil's Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT) and the 
Rio State Secretariat for Science and Technology.  For the past 
three years, Rio state has invested R$ 1.4 billion (approximately 
USD 636 million) in the RioBiodiesel Program. 
 
Tax Breaks 
---------- 
¶5.  The State of Rio de Janeiro will soon announce a state tax 
exemption for the biodiesel production chain.  According to the 
Coordinator of the RioBiodiesel Program, Eduardo Cavalcanti, the 
goal behind this measure is to make business related to the 
production of biofuels in the state more attractive.  The Rio 
State Secretariat for Science and Technology is currently working 
with the State Secretariat for Finance and with the National 
Treasury Council to obtain approval for the approval tax 
exemption. 
 
Consumption and Production 
-------------------------- 
¶6.  On January 25, 2006, the Rio State launched the first 
biodiesel public transportation bus in Brazil.  It will be tested 
for about 60 kilometers with a 5% mixture of biodiesel produced 
by the Federal Engineering Post Graduate University (COPPE) and 
compared with regular diesel supplied by Shell.  In contrast to 
 
RIO DE JAN 00000084  002 OF 002 
 
 
other states in Brazil that have abundant sources of castor oil 
and other oil seeds, the Rio biodiesel developed by COPPE is a 
biofuel produced out of raw materials such as bovine fat, sewage 
scum/foam, residual cooking oil, and vegetable oil. 
 
¶7.  Federal Law 11.097/2005 establishes minimum percentages for 
the use of biodiesel in diesel fuel.  This ranges from 2 percent 
from 2006 to 2007 (optional), 2 percent from 2008 to 2012 
(mandatory), and from 2013 on, the minimum percentage would be 5 
percent (mandatory).  However, the State of Rio de Janeiro has 
decided to take a more ambitious approach, and plans to mix 5 
percent of biodiesel to petroleum diesel by 2008. 
 
¶8.  The state of Rio consumes 2 billion/liters of petroleum 
diesel per year or 160 million/liters per month, which represents 
5 percent of all diesel consumed in Brazil.  The Rio state 
government alone consumes 6.5 million/liters per year.  Rio state 
government preliminary estimates indicate that Rio state will 
produce 4 million liters/per month of biodiesel in 2007, and 8 
million liters/per month in 2008. 
 
Benefits for Rio 
---------------- 
¶9.  Biodiesel production actively promotes job creation in Rio 
state as it is three times more labor intensive per unit of 
production than fossil fuel.  The state believes that during the 
period 2006-2008, 5,000 jobs will be created in the interior of 
the state as a result of biodiesel production.
