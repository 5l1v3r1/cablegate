SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR INAUGURATES THE USAID-SPONSORED PARAISOPOLIS 
ELECTRICITY PROJECT 
 
 
¶1.  Ambassador Sobel participated in a September 27 ceremony to 
inaugurate the USAID Paraisopolis Slum Electrification and Loss 
Reduction (SELR) Program.  Close to 100 people attended the 
ceremony.  In his comments, the Ambassador emphasized the importance 
of the project itself and the rapport between both United States and 
Brazil in similar endeavors. The Ambassador praised USAID's support 
of the project while simultaneously highlighting the significance of 
the private sector involvement.  The ceremony was attended by the 
project's private sector partners and others, including 
AES-Eletropaulo President Eduardo Jos Bernini, International Cooper 
Association (ICA) Regional Director Glycon Garcia Junior, USAID/EGAT 
Energy Team Leader Simone Lawaetz, representatives from the City of 
Sao Paulo (municipality), SEHAB (housing), SABESPE (water utility), 
ANEEL and CSPE (electricity regulatory bodies), NGOs, community 
leaders, politicians, and consultants. 
 
¶2.  Recognizing the very large, growing number of slum residents 
lacking legal and affordable access to electricity in developing 
countries, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in 
cooperation with the International Copper Association (ICA), 
launched the SELR Program in October 2005.  Since then, SELR has 
selected two cities in two countries (Sao Paulo and Mumbai, India) 
in which to develop, test and evaluate sustainable and 
widely-replicable approaches for increasing access to electricity 
services for low-income, urban consumers. 
 
¶3.  In Brazil, AES-Eletropaulo (AES), USAID, ICA, and Nexans-Brazil 
(a leading global cable manufacturer) are working to regularize 
electricity services in Parasopolis, a favela (slum) in the middle 
of Sao Paulo. It is the second largest favela in Sao Paulo and, like 
most other favelas, is an informal community that lacks most 
municipal services and is home to families that migrated from rural 
areas over the years.  Located in a large ravine, Paraisopolis has a 
physically challenging geography and is surrounded by middle- and 
upper-income residential areas. 
 
¶4.  The total cost of the Pilot is estimated to be about USD 1.85 
million.  USAID is providing USD 429,000. Also, SELR Program is 
currently seeking complementing funds to develop a sustainable 
mechanism for making legal electricity service affordable by 
replacing highly inefficient refrigerators and other appliances with 
new, efficient ones. Negotiations with Whirlpool, which has 
demonstrated interest in working with this partnership, are 
currently ongoing. Whirlpools participation may include the 
development of a scheme for households to repay Whirlpool for an 
efficient appliance using cost savings from decreased electricity 
bills, rebate programs, and the design of an efficient refrigerator 
that meets the specific needs of favela households. 
 
¶5.  This cable was coordinated with Embassy Brasilia and cleared by 
Ambassador Sobel.
