SUBJECT:  BRAZIL: MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE RESIGNS AFTER TUSSLE OVER 
FARM DEBT RELIEF 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) On June 28, Roberto Rodrigues, the GOB Minister of 
Agriculture announced his resignation, effective June 30.  While 
Rodrigues first attributed his departure to concerns about the 
health of his wife, he later indicated to the press that the real 
reason behind his exit was his inability to persuade the Lula 
Administration's economic team to do more for the agricultural 
sector.  Specifically, Rodrigues had sought: 1) more extensive debt 
forgiveness/rescheduling for financially-pressed farmers, and 2) 
more active government efforts to restrain the recent growth in 
Brazil's currency (the Real) against the dollar. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) However, notwithstanding Rodrigues' argument that the farm 
sector - burdened by drought, a drop in prices for key commodities 
such as soybeans, and the emergence of foot and mouth disease - 
urgently needed extraordinary assistance, the man with his hands on 
the government purse-strings, Finance Minister Guido Mantega, 
remained unconvinced and relations between the two deteriorated 
visibly.  Meanwhile, Rodrigues continued to feud with the left flank 
of the ruling PT party, which felt that he placed too much emphasis 
on the needs of export-oriented agri-business and too little on the 
needs of subsistence farmers.  Finally, cognizant that he would lose 
the support of the country's agricultural producers if he could not 
"bring home the (financial) bacon," Rodrigues resigned. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  A sugar farmer by trade, Rodrigues had been one of the 
few ministers remaining from President Lula's original cabinet. 
Trained as an agricultural engineer, he has been one of the most 
effective Agriculture Ministers in recent Brazilian history as 
during his four years in office he oversaw an unprecedented 
expansion of the country's farm exports.  On June 30, Lula named 
Vice-Minister Luis Carlos Guedes Pinto to replace Rodrigues on an 
interim basis.  It is unlikely that a permanent replacement will be 
named until the new President (whether it be a reelected Lula or 
opposition candidate Geraldo Alckmin) assumes office in January 
¶2007.  Guedes Pinto, a long-time Agriculture Ministry official, is 
well-known to FAS Brasilia and in the past has been a valuable 
interlocutor for USG officials. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Comment.  While Rodrigues' departure, and the assumption 
of caretaker Guedes Pinto to the job, means that the Finance 
Ministry has prevailed for now in its battle to scrimp on government 
agricultural spending, the war between the two ministries is by no 
means over.  Given the increasing importance of both the 
agricultural export sector and the rural bancada (caucus) in the 
Brazilian congress, one can expect the issues of debt relief and the 
exchange rate to resurface in coming months.
