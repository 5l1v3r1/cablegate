¶1.  (SBU) On February 18, Post delivered to the Ministry of Exterior 
Relations (MRE) the invitation letter (REFTEL E) to Minister Celso 
Amorim from Secretary Clinton to attend the ministerial-level event 
in Washington on April 6, 2009, commemorating the 50th anniversary 
of the Antarctic Treaty and promoting international collaboration on 
polar science in follow-up to the then just-completed International 
Polar Year (IPY).  The MRE has been aware of this event (REFTEL D), 
but has not yet decided who will head the Brazilian delegation. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On February 20, the Ambassador met with MRE Under 
Secretary for Policy, Ambassador Everton Vargas.  When the issue of 
Brazil approving the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) 
Measure 1 (2003), which establishes the Antarctic Treaty 
Secretariat, was raised per REFTEL E, Ambassador Vargas indicated 
that they would see what the MRE could do to expedite consideration 
by the Brazilian Congress.  NOTE.  Ambassador Vargas cautioned that 
the Brazilian Congress is an independent body that sets its own 
agenda.  He pointed out that he himself was personally aware of this 
fact because he has been waiting a long time for the Senate's 
confirmation of him as Brazil's new ambassador to Germany, even 
though his confirmation is a high priority for MRE.  END NOTE. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On February 20, MRE informed Post that the Director of the 
MRE's Environment Department, Minister Luis Figueiredo Machado, will 
meet with Deputy Bonifacio de Andrada, the key member within the 
Constitution, Justice, and Citizenship Commission of the Chamber of 
Deputies, to press for expedited consideration and approval of ATCM 
Measure 1.
