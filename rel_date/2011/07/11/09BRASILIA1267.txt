COOPERATION 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: After almost a 3 year absence in Brazil, TSA 
successfully resumed airport security visits in Brazil on August 10, 
2009, and is poised to expand this important relationship through 
technical exchanges and increased cooperation in other civil 
aviation related security areas. With the goal of capitalizing on 
this positive development,  TSA's Director of International 
Operations in the Office of Global Strategies, Robert Rottman, met 
with Brazilian air transportation officials and Brazil's Foreign 
Ministry, October 5-8 in Brasilia, to acknowledge their efforts in 
helping to restart TSA's Foreign Airport Assessment Program (FAAP), 
to recognize their assistance during recently successful airport 
security visits, to finalize details of the remaining 2009 airport 
security visits, to explore areas of mutual technical cooperation, 
and to discuss TSA's plan to establish a TSAR office in Brasilia. 
The visit established that there is scope and mutual interest in 
improving aviation security cooperation while enhancing Brazil's 
regional leadership role in this area.  End Summary. 
MRE- KEY STAKEHOLDER 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Virginia Toniatti, Director for the General Coordination to 
Combat Transnational Crimes Division at the Ministry of External 
Relations, and a pivotal player in ensuring cooperation with 
Brazil's government, acknowledged TSA's successful work during its 
recent airport visits.  She also stressed the importance of 
continued cooperation and communication with not only her office, 
but with Brazil's Federal Airport Infrastructure Agency (INFRAERO) 
and Brazil's Civil Aviation Regulatory Agency (ANAC) to ensure TSA's 
sustained success in Brazil.  Toniatti expressed interest in working 
with TSA to establish Brazilian regional leadership in the area of 
civil aviation security and was very pleased to hear that TSA 
bilateral engagement already involved many developed nations.  She 
requested additional information on TSA's organization, TSAR's 
office locations (current and planned), and clarification on TSA's 
role versus FAA's (Note: This information has since been given to 
MRE, ANAC and INFRAERO for their review. End Note).  Besides showing 
interest in other TSA areas of responsibility such as waterways, 
ports, rail, subways, and pipelines, Toniatti was receptive to the 
offer of possible TSA support for World Cup 2014 and Olympics 2016 
planning.  Upon hearing of TSA's proposal to place a permanent TSAR 
office in Brasilia, Toniatti explained that she would have to 
present the idea to other GOB officials for their review upon 
receipt of the proposal through diplomatic channels. 
 
ANAC- POSITIVE COLLABORATION 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Meetings with ANAC President Solange Vieira, Director 
Alexandre Barros, and Security Manager Leonardo Boszczowski centered 
on the successful re-instatement of TSA's FAAP and potential 
training that could enhance ANAC's civil aviation security 
capacities.  Vieira was pleased with the progress of the airport 
visits and with the fact that TSA has been impressed by ANAC's 
airport security procedures and preparedness.  Vieira requested 
information on possible TSA training opportunities and information 
on the TSA agency structure and related roles and responsibilities 
with an eye on possible collaboration for the 2014 World Cup and 
2016 Olympics.  She also accepted an invitation to tour TSA 
headquarters on her next visit to the United States.  Both Vieira 
and Barros welcomed the TSA proposal of placing a TSAR in Brasilia, 
adding that Boszczowski's recent permanent reassignment from Rio de 
Janeiro to Brasilia could lead to greater engagement opportunities. 
In recognizing TSA as one of the best aviation security agencies in 
the world, Barros confirmed the schedule of future TSA airport 
security visits and offered that this type of cooperation could 
enhance ANAC's regional regulatory leadership role in civil aviation 
security. 
 
INFRAERO- KEY PARTNER 
--------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) INFRAERO's President Murilo Barboza expressed pleasure with 
the INFRAERO and TSA working relationship.  Having been impressed 
during previous visits to TSA headquarters, he expressed his hope 
that an even closer working relationship could be established 
through technical exchanges to allow his staff to visit TSA offices 
and airports.  Barboza expressed a particular interest in aviation 
security intelligence as an area for increased cooperation.  Barboza 
stated that he supported the placement of a TSAR in Brasilia, 
arguing that this would strengthen TSA's case for formalizing a 
 
BRASILIA 00001267  002 OF 002 
 
 
Federal Air Marshall's program (FAM) with the MRE and would improve 
TSA's abilities to assist INFRAERO in preparing for the 2014 World 
Cup and 2016 Olympics.  Barboza added that TSA was welcome to visit 
any of the INFRAERO-managed airports in Brazil. 
 
¶5. (U) Rottman met INFRAERO's Brasilia Airport Superintendent Abibe 
Junior during a brief security tour in preparations for the formal 
TSA security visit scheduled for October 28-30.  Junior spoke about 
his airport's security capabilities, the airport's expansion plans, 
and expressed confidence in Delta beginning its direct Atlanta and 
Brasilia on time (December 17, 2009). 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  The interest shown by government security 
officials in TSA's visit is a reflection of the attention and 
urgency that Brazil has in developing its civil aviation security 
apparatus to not only accommodate the World Cup in 2014 and the Rio 
Olympics in 2016, but also to establish Brazil's regional leadership 
in this area. TSA's holistic approach to engagement with Brazil on 
this sensitive subject has generated excellent progress to date.  By 
updating MRE on the negotiations with ANAC and working closely with 
ANAC to internally build support with MRE, the visit yielded 
productive results in moving aviation security cooperation forward. 
Post recommends that this approach continue to be used during future 
TSA discussions in Brazil, which stands a good chance of success as 
we seek to deepen the Brazil-United States relationship on aviation 
security.  End Comment.
