"The distension Summit" 
 
Main Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (4-21) states: 
"The main event of the 5th Summit of the Americas, in Port of Spain, 
was that it did not happen what was expected - a confrontation with 
the U.S. for which Venezuela's President, Hugo Chavez, had prepared 
his Bolivarians [counterparts] - leaders of Bolivia, Ecuador, 
Nicaragua, Honduras and Dominican - for.....What was left from the 
summit - besides the conviction that it could not have been better - 
is the question about the direction to ease the tension between 
Washington and Havana...."
