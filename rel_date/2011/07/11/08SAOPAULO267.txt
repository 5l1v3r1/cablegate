¶1. (U) On May 29, Fitch upgraded Brazil's sovereign risk rating to 
investment grade, from BB+ (neutral outlook) to BBB- (neutral 
outlook).  According to Fitch, "the impressive improvement in 
external finances, in part due to higher commodity prices, but also 
the result of good policy management, along with the sovereign's net 
creditor status has made Brazil much more resilient to global 
financial shocks and enhanced the credibility of its macroeconomic 
policy framework."  The upgrade by Fitch came much more swiftly than 
anticipated (only 29 days since S&P's upgrade on April 30 Ref A). 
The second upgrade to investment grade by the three major ratings 
agencies took significantly longer in other emerging markets; one 
year in the case of Russia and two in the case of Mexico. 
 
¶2. (SBU) With an investment grade credit rating from both Fitch and 
S&P, Brazil's base of potential investors increases, since some 
institutional investors may face restrictions in investing in 
countries that have only received investment grade status with one 
rating agency.  Increased investment, especially from institutional 
investors such as pension funds and the insurance industry will 
enable a reduction in the GOB's financing costs, accelerate the 
improvement of the public debt profile, and allow Brazilian bonds to 
be included in indices that serve as a benchmark for large global 
investment funds. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The third major credit rating agency, Moody's, has been 
less positive about the prospects for an early upgrade for Brazil 
mainly due to fiscal policies, specifically high levels of 
government spending as a percent of GDP (Ref B).  The expectation 
from our interactions with Moody's Director for Brazil was that the 
rating agency would change its outlook from neutral to positive by 
year-end, and grant Brazil investment grade in 2009.  However, 
Central Bank interlocutors have indicated that Moody's may in fact 
be moving more quickly than anticipated in following the other 
credit ratings agencies and may upgrade Brazil this year. 
Regardless, Brazil has surpassed the main barrier of earning an 
investment grade sovereign credit rating from two of the three main 
rating agencies.  Brazil is now more open to many institutional 
investors and should experience significant increases in 
international investment.
