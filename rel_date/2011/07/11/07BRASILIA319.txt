¶1.  (U) EconOff delivered reftel points in to Peter Fox, GOB Deputy 
Director of Division of Market Access at the MFA.  Fox, who will 
leave for the Geneva talks on 24 February, said that he had read in 
full the USG position on the issue and, after discussions both 
internally and externally with private industry groups, the GOB 
identified two issues preventing it from co-sponsoring the USG text 
as presented. 
 
¶2.  (U) First, he noted that the GOB is in the process of 
standardizing labeling within Mercosul.  Since this has not been 
completed, the GOB does not have a base for comparison of Mercosul 
standards to the USG position. 
 
¶3.  (U) Second, he stated that while awaiting a Mercosul policy, the 
GOB is using an internally developed rule and the USG position does 
not "precisely" fit GOB requirements.  He added that the GOB is open 
to discussions in Geneva to find common ground on this issue.
