SUBJECT: O GLOBO NEWSPAPER, THE OBAMA ERA 
 
Center-right O Globo commented on page 06 (01/21/2009): "The 44th 
President of the United States distinguishes himself from his 
predecessors in significant ways.  For example, his Arab-sounding 
name and the fact that he is the first African American to occupy 
the White House.  It is impossible not to associate him with the 
word "hope."  The United States and the world wait for winds of 
change which can blow away the eight years of the George W. Bush 
Administration... 79% of the Americans say they are optimistic about 
the Obama Administration.  The two terms of George W. Bush in the 
White House were struck by plagues like the fundamentalist terrorist 
attacks of September 11, 2001.  Then came the wars in Afghanistan 
and Iraq, stemming in part from the attacks on the Twin Towers and 
the Pentagon.   And furthermore, the [USG's] failure to provide 
proper assistance to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  Obama 
inherits the management of these two ruinous wars and yet another 
hurricane - one which began on Wall Street, shook the U.S. economy 
and blew furiously around the world... Fate has put this young 
politician in command of the last super power under dramatic 
circumstances.  It is not reasonable to expect him to walk on water. 
 But one must root for Obama's success in leading the United States 
to a safe place, minimizing losses and paving the way to new ethics 
in policymaking and international relations.  For rescuing the hope 
and faith of the American people and hailing to traditional and 
sacred values, Obama is the best the United States and the world 
could have in face of the current crisis."
