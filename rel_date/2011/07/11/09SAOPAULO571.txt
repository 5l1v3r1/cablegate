SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - Criticism of Brazil's Role in Honduras 
 
"Who makes the decisions now is Uncle Chavez" 
 
Editorial in Brazil's major magazine, with a weekly circulation of 
1.23 million, stated that by transforming the Brazilian embassy into 
ousted President Manuel Zelaya's headquarters Brazil has only served 
Hugo Chavez' greed in the region.  Veja compares the situation to 
1965, when Brazil helped the U.S. military in the Dominican 
Republic; now Brazil is "siding" with Uncle Chavez not with Uncle 
Sam like it did before.  It also questions what led the Brazilian 
government to act in a supporting role of Chavista expansionism in 
Latin America and says that the actions in Honduras are not in the 
interest of the Brazilian people.  "Supporting Zelaya does not mean 
defending democracy.  It means supporting Chavez' dictatorship."  It 
also says that working with Chavez to arrange Zelaya's return to 
Honduras only served the electoral interests of President Lula's 
party (PT).
