REF: A. PHNOM PENH 65 
     ¶B. STATE 3080 
 
¶1.  In a follow-up response to Ref A, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and International Cooperation (MFA) informed Post 
that the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) officially 
associated itself with the Copenhagen Accord on January 29. 
In its notification to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat, the RGC 
reaffirmed its commitment to actively engage with the 
international community to tackle the climate change 
challenge.  The notice also highlighted Cambodia's progress 
implementing a pilot Reducing Emissions from Deforestation 
and Degradation (REDD) project.  (NOTE:  Cambodia has signed 
on to the UN-REDD framework and is developing two projects 
that would potentially earn financing under the voluntary 
carbon markets. END NOTE.)  Post has forwarded to EAP/MLS a 
copy of the RGC's notice to the UNFCCC Secretariat.
