¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel talking points and the five 
principles to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International 
Cooperation via diplomatic note June 12. Econoff and USAID officer 
June 15 delivered reftel demarche to Ngy Chanphal, Second 
Vice-Chairman of the Council for Agriculture and Rural Development 
and Secretary of State, Ministry of Interior. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mr. Ngy welcomed the U.S. global initiative, and the 
commitment to country-led processes in particular.  He explained 
that the seven key areas for investment complimented the Royal 
Government of Cambodia's (RGC) strategy for promoting agriculture 
development and food security. 
 
¶3. (SBU) He acknowledged that food security is a significant problem 
in Cambodia, where it is estimated that twenty percent of the rural 
population is landless, and twenty-five percent of those with land 
have less than 0.5 hectares -- too small a plot to provide 
sufficient food for a family.  (NOTE:  These estimates are based on 
a 2008 Cambodia Development Research Institute (CDRI) survey, 
"Impact of High Food Prices in Cambodia," which surveyed 2,235 
households and found respondents' unconfirmed self-reporting showed 
that 21.1 percent are landless, and 23.4 percent hold less than half 
a hectare of land.  End Note.)  Access to food, in addition to 
production and availability, is a key challenge facing Cambodia's 
rural poor.  When informed that USAID is planning to develop in 
consultation with the RGC an agriculture development and food 
security program, Mr. Ngy was pleased that the U.S. is planning to 
take an active role in this important field.
