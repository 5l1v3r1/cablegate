¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Despite a dramatic reduction in NAS Brasilia 
external activities since June 2006, while an internal 
re-organization and new overall program strategy were being 
developed, INL authorized the continued support of several projects. 
 In cooperation with other USG agencies at post, NAS support has 
helped the Government of Brazil make important advances in its drug 
prevention and law enforcement programs, including numerous seizures 
of illicit narcotics and weapons, and the arrest of important drug 
traffickers.  In one notable example, intelligence developed via NAS 
supported, DEA-vetted Sensitive Investigative Units (SIUs) helped 
bring about the capture of Juan Carlos Ramirez-Abadia, a notorious 
Colombian drug trafficker.  NAS Brasilia looks forward to expanding 
its counter-narcotics and law enforcement programs, in line with its 
revitalized strategy, which will likely produce additional results. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------- 
SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIVE UNITS 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) NAS Brasilia has continued to support DEA-vetted Sensitive 
Investigative Units (SIUs) via assistance such as travel, per diem, 
and translation services, which has allowed DEA Brazil to cooperate 
with the Brazilian Federal Police (DPF) to initiate several 
investigations and develop important intelligence involving illicit 
narcotics and contraband being trafficked through Brazil and 
destined for the United States.  Several operations have resulted in 
the capture of high-level drug traffickers: 
 
¶A.  On August 7, Brazilian Federal Police, acting on intelligence 
developed by the Sao Paulo SIU, captured Juan Carlos Ramirez-Abadia, 
a Colombian national, in a raid on a luxury home near Sao Paulo, 
from which authorities say he oversaw a multibillion-dollar drug and 
money laundering ring stretching to Europe and the United States. 
Ramirez-Abadia gained notoriety in the 1990s as a leader of the 
still powerful Norte del Valle cartel based near Cali, and had 
undergone extensive plastic surgery to change his appearance in a 
bid to avoid being identified.  The DPF seized U.S. and foreign 
currency worth approximately USD 615,000, gym equipment worth USD 
500,000, ten flat screen televisions, artwork, jewelry, and four 
vehicles at Ramirez-Abadia's house in Brazil.  Brazilian and 
Colombian authorities also seized numerous assets, including 
property valued at USD 4 million, jewelry worth approximately USD 1 
million, nearly 70 vehicles, U.S. and foreign currency worth almost 
USD 1.2 million, nearly 100 jet skis from one of Ramirez-Abadia's 
companies, approximately 100 cell phones and 300 sim cards.  On 
August 10, the DPF arrested two of Ramirez-Abadia's accomplices in 
Campinas, Sao Paulo: Colombian Jaime Verano Garcia and Brazilian 
Eliseu Almeida de Machado, who reportedly carried more than USD 
500,000 in Brazilian currency with them. 
 
¶B.  The DPF also worked closely with DEA Brazil and federal law 
enforcement agencies in Argentina and Uruguay on operation "San 
Francisco," a three-year long investigation based out of the SIU in 
Sao Paulo.  During the span of the investigation, the SIU 
intercepted 38 telephone lines being used by a Colombian drug 
trafficking organization headed by Gustavo Duran-Bautista. 
Intelligence gathered while monitoring over 300,000 calls indicated 
that the FARC (16th Front) was supplying Duran-Bautista with 
Colombian cocaine, which was then smuggled by his export companies 
out of South America, hidden in shipments of produce, and 
transported to Europe and the United States via maritime routes.  On 
August 18, the Uruguayan Federal Police arrested Gustavo 
Duran-Bautista, Angel Andres Duran Bautista, Julio Cesar Duran 
Bautista, Juan Carlos Villamil Parra, and Fredy Reaiana, all of whom 
are Colombian nationals.  The DPF arrested two Brazilian pilots: 
Neilson Mongeloso and Plinio Lopes Ribeiro.  The Uruguayan Federal 
Police seized approximately 485 kilograms of pure Colombian cocaine 
and a Barron 55 airplane; the DPF are in the process of seizing over 
23 properties -- including farms, houses, ranches, and apartments 
located in six Brazilian states -- and another airplane and 
 
BRASILIA 00001772  002 OF 003 
 
 
helicopter.  Thanks to the SIU intelligence, the DPF also anticipate 
arresting nine other individuals involved in the Duran-Bautista drug 
trafficking organization. 
 
¶C.  Based on wire intercepts, the Rio de Janeiro SIU received 
information that the Beira Mar drug trafficking organization was 
preparing to transport narcotics, firearms, and ammunition from 
Pelotas and Porto Alegre, two cities located in the southern state 
of Rio Grande do Sul.  The SIU intelligence indicated that the 
shipment was destined to the Primeiro Commando da Capital (PCC) -- 
one of Brazil's most powerful organized criminal gangs.  On April 
17, the operation led to the arrest on April 17 of five Brazilian 
nationals, and the seizure of 50 kilograms of cocaine, 10 kilograms 
of marijuana, various firearms, and ammunition. 
 
¶D.  On May 29, 2007, the DPF in the state of Parana, acting on 
information provided by the Rio de Janeiro SIU, seized 174 kilograms 
of HCL cocaine and a Cessna Skylane aircraft.  The DPF also arrested 
three Brazilian nationals at the Municipal airport in Marechal 
Candido Rondon, Parana, which is located approximately 180 
kilometers from Foz do Iguacu.  This seizure is also believed to be 
connected to the Beira Mar drug trafficking organization. 
 
¶E.  There have also been several instances of Mexican nationals 
arrested for attempting to smuggle Colombian heroin out of Brazil to 
Mexico (ultimately destined for the United States) and individuals 
using express mail and the Brazilian Postal Service to send packages 
containing heroin to the United States. 
 
------------------------ 
OFFICER EXCHANGE PROGRAM 
------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On March 1, 2007, representatives from Argentina, Bolivia, 
Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Paraguay met in Asuncion to discuss the 
Officer Exchange Program and sign a memorandum of understanding 
(MOU).  NAS Brasilia has funded TDY travel for up to six Bolivian 
SIU officers to assist in SIU investigations targeting Spanish 
speakers.  It is anticipated that four more Bolivians will be 
assigned to work at the Bolivia-Brazil border.  The police officers 
who are part of the program are positioned in neighboring countries 
and are able to investigate, share real-time intelligence, and 
target members of international drug trafficking organizations. 
This cooperative exchange of officers has allowed agents from other 
South American countries to build professional and comfortable 
working relationships where none existed previously.  It has also 
allowed for the successful completion of International Controlled 
Deliveries (ICDs), greater confidence in intelligence sharing, and a 
more extensive use of the Centers for Drug Information (CDI) 
terminal system for the exchange of information. 
 
------------------------ 
DEMAND REDUCTION PROGRAM 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) In early 2007, the Brazilian National Anti-drug Secretariat 
(SENAD) released the results of the 2005-2006 national household 
drug consumption survey, jointly funded by NAS and SENAD.  The 
results indicated that since the last survey was done in 2001, 
marijuana consumption had increased from 6.9% to 8.8% and cocaine 
consumption had increased from 2.3% to 2.9%.  NAS has also supported 
SENAD's efforts to reach drug users via a toll free number which 
provides educational material and information on stopping drug 
abuse. 
 
¶5.  (U) The U.S. based Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program 
(DARE) or as it is known in Brazil, PROERD, is the second largest 
DARE program in the world and is implemented in all of Brazil's 26 
states and the Federal District.  Our support for regional and 
international training during 2007 included funding the travel of 
two educators, accompanied by an interpreter, to the 20th Annual 
International DARE conference in Nashville, Tennessee.

QUARTERLY DPF STATISTICS 
------------------------ 
 
¶6.  (U) The Brazilian Federal Police (DPF) have reported increased 
drug seizures in FY 2007, compared to last year -- a phenomenon 
attributable to both improved interdiction effectiveness and an 
increase in the amount of drugs produced by neighboring countries 
that is transiting Brazil.  The following drug seizure and arrest 
statistics are provided by the DPF, and are in kilograms, unless 
otherwise noted.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Despite improved cooperation with its neighbors, Brazil's 
expansive territory and borders make effective border control and 
narcotics enforcement in the vast Amazonian region -- more than half 
the national territory -- a serious challenge.  Interagency USG 
coordination and NAS support have been key to achieving the kinds of 
results noted above, and will remain vital to our future 
counter-narcotics and law enforcement efforts.
