OPPORTUNITY FOR THE US AND CUBA 
 
Editorial in April 19 issue of center left Jornal do Brasil (page 
A8) states: "The statement was so surprising that it took 
international diplomacy off guard. The simple confession of errors 
by the Cuban President... To admit that officers of the Cuban regime 
are human beings who make mistakes is far from the 
habitual...justifications for excesses during the eternal battle 
against so-called capitalist imperialism. Raul Castro's statement at 
the Summit of the Americas, in Trinidad and Tobago, was received 
with a relative endorsement by the USG, which made it a condition 
for a window of dialogue for a series of initiatives and political 
openings demanded from Havana. It was not a gesture consistent with 
what has been said by a leader of a country conflagrated by decades 
of isolation, especially when globalization is advancing - an era in 
which China has already shown the way for [economic] opening without 
changing the political model. 
 
While Ral Castro said that Cuba and the U.S. could talk as equals, 
President Barack Obama made it clear that there are those that are 
more equal than others. The White House spokesperson mentioned the 
release of political prisoners in Cuba, more free press and freedom 
of speech, in addition to the end of screening of mail from people 
who send money to relatives as important indicators of how true 
Castro's intentions are. This remark, despite sounding like a sign 
of arrogance by the U.S., is a careful move to pave an approach 
without hostile acts or internal sabotage. There is an important and 
powerful community who could lose it all if the economic embargo to 
the regime was halted as a result of a negotiation initiated by a 
confession of weakness. The anti-Castroists who live in Miami became 
such a powerful domestic force...the invasion of the Bay of Pigs 
showed the size of this movement. They would be the sharks 
inspecting the foundations of this new bridge. 
It is necessary to dismantle such a scenario with extreme caution, 
and this is why the U.S. cited conditions without making them 
formal, despite already loosening the ties for everyday practices - 
measures such as reducing restrictions for traveling from the U.S. 
to the Caribbean island, as well as money transfers, which were 
prohibited by former President George W. Bush. It also allowed 
companies such as AT&T to offer data transmission services or 
telephone services to Cuba. The optimistic manifestation by 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton follows the model of foreign 
policy in the Obama era, which considers the sum of seemingly 
superficial acts as a safe path to finally put an end to five 
decades of isolation. 
Bringing Cuba closer to the U.S. would be a huge event for the 
continent and would end a rhetoric discussion that during all these 
years was the justification, for both sides, for sustaining 
decisions which always brought seclusion. May the warm weather in 
the Caribbean bring this historical result for world politics. The 
future will be thankful."
