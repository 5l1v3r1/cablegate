STUDY RESULTS 
 
 
¶1.  Brazil's Minister of Environment, Marina Silva, presented on 
February 27, 2007, the expected consequences of the impacts of 
global warming on the biodiversity of Brazil for the next 100 years 
(from 2010 to 2100).  The results came from a total of eight studies 
that were requested by the Ministry in 2004. The studies, which will 
be used as references for future policy making, should not be taken 
as a prediction of the future, the Minister cautioned, but instead 
as a warning of the consequences that global warming could have on 
Brazil. 
¶2.  The studies concluded that due to climate change, mainly a rise 
in temperatures, the sea level would increase 4 millimeters a year 
along the Brazilian coastline where 25% of the country's population 
(42 million inhabitants) is concentrated.  Some islands of the 
southeast region would be partially or completely covered by water. 
The rise in sea level would affect wetlands and other vegetations 
along the coastline of Brazil.  Various fish species would also 
become extinct. 
 
¶3.  Because of the variations in temperature, tropical forest trees 
might decrease their CO2 absorption capacity due to their 
sensitivity to temperature changes.  If temperatures rose over three 
degree Celsius, coral reefs, which are very sensitive to changes in 
water temperature, would be threatened. 
¶4.  Climate change could also bring enormous risks to the country's 
health sector.  Changes in temperature would increase the risks of 
diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and encephalitis, 
which all reproduce faster in hotter temperatures.  Respiratory 
diseases would also become more common due to increased forest fires 
and the lack of rain.  The high temperatures could increase death 
rates among children and elderly inhabitants. 
 
¶5.  The two most alarming results of the studies, however, relate to 
the Pantanal and the Amazon rainforest.  The study predicts that the 
Pantanal, which now has seasonal flooding, might experience constant 
flood periods, which would totally disrupt the life cycle processes 
of the ecosystems of the region and result in the extinction of many 
of the fauna and flora. By 2050, portions of the Amazon forest could 
be experiencing shorter rainy seasons the report concludes, and when 
combined with the effect of the expected higher temperatures, could 
produce desert or arid areas.
