SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. During his September 26-28 visit to Sao Paulo, Ambassador Sobel 
held several meetings devoted to cooperation on education.  At a 
lunch hosted by the Consul General with senior representatives of 
several major Sao Paulo universities, the Ambassador heard various 
views on Brazilian higher education and discussed ways of fostering 
cooperation and partnerships between Brazilian universities and the 
USG, as well as the possibility of forming a U.S. Studies Center. 
He subsequently met with the international affairs director of one 
university which is trying to develop such a Center and discussed 
the initiative in more detail.  The Ambassador's meeting with 
private sector leaders and participation in a USAID project 
inauguration are reported in septels.  END SUMMARY.

LUNCH WITH UNIVERSITY LEADERS 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. On September 26, the Ambassador and Mrs. Sobel, accompanied by 
Consul General, PAO, and PA FSN, had lunch with three university 
representatives to discuss ideas for possible cooperation between 
the U.S. Embassy and Brazilian institutions of higher education. 
The guests were Rector Marcos Macari of Sao Paulo State University 
(UNESP), Vice-Rector Pedro Ronzelli Junior of Mackenzie University, 
and Renee Zicman, Coordinator of International Relations at the 
Catholic University of Sao Paulo (PUC-SP). 
 
¶3. The Ambassador asked about American Studies at different 
Brazilian universities.  The Brazilians replied that Brazilian 
universities do not have departments and/or professors devoted 
exclusively to the study of the U.S.  UNESP, UNICAMP and PUC/SP have 
had a joint program for the last few years that gives MA degrees in 
International Relations.  They also mentioned the strong 
business/economics departments at Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV), the 
University of Sao Paulo, and the Federal University of Rio de 
Janeiro's COPPEAD. 
 
¶4. The Ambassador mentioned that he would like to see consular 
junior officers go out in the field and visit universities, where 
they could talk to students about U.S. culture, history, politics, 
and other issues, and take questions from the students about life in 
the U.S.  He also highlighted the importance of having U.S. 
lecturers, Fulbrighters or others come to Brazilian universities to 
promote U.S. studies. 
 
¶5. The possibility of forming a U.S. Studies Center at an 
institution of higher education was discussed.  Several years ago, 
after arduous work, the Consulate succeeded in establishing a U.S. 
studies center at the University of Sao Paulo; however, for a 
variety of reasons, a U.S.-style multi-disciplinary area studies 
program has not taken hold.  A discussion ensued as to where and how 
a new U.S. studies center might be established.  Former Ambassadors 
Rubens Ricupero, Sergio Amaral and Rubens Barbosa are discussing the 
possibility of installing a U.S. Studies Center at the Faculdade 
Armando Alvaro Penteado (FAAP) (see para 8), another prominent 
private university in Sao Paulo.  The Brazilians felt that rather 
than choosing a university for a home office, a neutral ground 
should be identified. (NOTE: the Consulate in Sao Paulo has 
established a U.S.-Brazil Studies Center at the University Center of 
SENAC, and there is a Fulbright Chair in American Studies at the 
Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro (PUC-RJ).  END NOTE.) 
 
¶6. Concerning students and student organizations, the Brazilians 
pointed out that Brazilian university student organizations were 
much more political than academic, and that if an academic 
discussion were to be undertaken with students, it would be more 
prudent to choose outstanding student leaders at different 
universities rather than working with student organizations. 
 
¶7. Ambassador Sobel noted out that partnerships between public and 
private institutions was a model that has worked very well for 
universities in the United States.  He also proposed organizing a 
special International Visitors program for the rectors of the top 
6-7 universities in Sao Paulo.  The program would give the rectors 
exposure to a number of premier U.S. universities and would also 
facilitate student exchanges and other relationships.

SERGIO AMARAL: AMERICAN STUDIES CENTER 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  The Ambassador also met with Sergio Amaral, former Ambassador in 
London and Paris and current director of International Affairs at 
FAAP.  Amaral outlined the efforts by FAAP, with support from other 
academic and private sector institutions, to develop an American 
Studies Center.  The Center would invite speakers from the U.S. for 
monthly lectures and conferences.  Current plans are for an 
organizational meeting in November with an inauguration in 2007. 
The focus would not be on bilateral relations, but rather on 
promoting knowledge about how the U.S. works.  The Ambassador 
expressed support and said such a Center could be an excellent 
resource for major universities in Sao Paulo.  He agreed to meet 
again with Amaral and others involved in the initiative on a future 
visit; Amaral suggested a lunch at FAAP. 
 
¶9.  On other issues, Amaral expressed concern over the prospects for 
Brazil to keep its GSP benefits.  With respect to the election, he 
said that 10 days ago, President Lula was almost guaranteed a 
first-round victory, but that the scenario had changed because of 
the "dossier" scandal.  He believes that now the election will go to 
a second round.  Although he anticipated that Lula will retain a 
strong advantage, he said that many voters are disgruntled by the 
barrage of scandals and Lula's repeated professions that he knew 
nothing and was betrayed.  Amaral's view is that people are in fact 
paying attention to the revelations and it may cause some of them to 
change their votes.  If re-elected, Amaral concluded, Lula will be 
debilitated and will have difficulty working with the PMDB, the 
centrist party that would most likely be Lula's main coalition 
partner in Congress. 
 
¶10.  This cable was coordinated with Embassy Brasilia, and cleared 
by Ambassador Sobel.
