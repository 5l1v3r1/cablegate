"If Doha Fails" 
 
Center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (6/24) editorialized: "It is 
necessary to think about alternative solutions in case the Doha 
Round trade negotiations fail.... The US has already made progress 
in doing this.... The Doha project is not yet buried, but time for 
its conclusion is dangerously short.... There are difficulties on 
all fronts.... If nothing works in Doha, it will be necessary to 
look for other means to facilitate trade.... For Brazil, a solution 
would be the normal continuation of the policy adopted by the 
Foreign Ministry since 2003. The intensification of relations with 
South Africa and India continues to be on top of Brazil's diplomatic 
agenda.... The GOB also continues to work for Latin American 
integration, a task that has been made difficult because of 
frictions created by Venezuela and Bolivia.  The only bloc in which 
Brazil fully participates, Mercosul, is shaky and will hardly become 
strengthened with Venezuela's membership.... It is very likely that 
in view of new opportunities of bilateral agreements, Uruguay and 
Paraguay are tempted to leave Mercosul for a rapprochement with the 
US. Trade agreements with other developing nations can be very 
useful for Brazil.... But it will be a disastrous mistake to make 
the South-South diplomacy an alternative to trade agreements with 
the European Union, the US and other rich world partners. The best 
plan is to seriously reconsider the FTAA and think about good 
bilateral trade agreements."
