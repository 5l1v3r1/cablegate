SUBJECT: URUGUAY STILL DITHERING ON PSI 
 
REF: STATE 50811 
 
Classified By: Charge D'Affaires James D. Nealon 
for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Per instructions reftel, we have at various 
opportunities urged the GOU to endorse the Proliferation 
Security Initiative (PSI) Statement of Interdiction 
Principles and encouraged it to attend the Senior Level 
Political meeting in Poland, in June.  Embassy understands 
that the embassies of Italy, Spain and the UK have also 
demarched the MFA on this subject.  The MFA's acting Director 
General for Political Affairs Alvaro Gallardo recently told 
us that he had recommended endorsing the PSI Statement of 
Interdiction Principles though a diplomatic note, but that 
Foreign Minister Reinaldo Gargano had demurred in order to 
consult more closely with other countries in the region 
about PSI", before he made up his mind. 
 
¶2. (C) Comment: Embassy will continue to pursue Uruguay's 
endorsement of PSI, although we are reluctant to raise it 
directly with the anti-American Foreign Minister since this 
could provoke a counter-productive reaction. End Comment.
