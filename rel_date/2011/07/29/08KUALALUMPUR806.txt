SUBJECT: OPPOSITION JOURNALIST DETAILED UNDER THE INTERNAL SECURITY ACT 
 
REF: KUALA LUMPUR 787 
 
Classified By: Political Section Chief Mark D. Clark, reason 1.4 (b and 
 d). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  Malaysian police on September 12 arrested 
controversial blogger Raja Petra Kamaruddin under the 
Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows for detention 
without trial.  Raja Petra's arrest came days after Prime 
Minister Abdullah threatened to use the ISA to clamp down on 
those allegedly stoking racial and religious tensions.  The 
arrest stands as a warning to the growing Internet media, but 
also sends a signal to the political Opposition, which has 
vowed to topple Abdullah's coalition later this month, that 
the UMNO-led government could take stern measures to defend 
itself.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Malaysian police detained Raja Petra Kamaruddin, 
prominent blogger and editor of the controversial website 
"Malaysia Today", under the Internal Security Act (ISA) on 
September 12.  The ISA allows for detention without trial. 
This is the first time the Act has been implemented for 
blogging.  Raja Petra's detention came days after Prime 
Minister Abdullah Badawi told reporters that the government 
would use the ISA on those who stoke racial and religious 
tensions, following inter-racial feuding in this coalition 
and mounting challenges to Abdullah's authority and political 
position (Septel). 
 
¶3. (U) Home Minister Syed Hamid Albar, who approved Raja 
Petra's ISA detention order, told reporters that the blogger 
was detained under Section 73(1) of the ISA because he was 
deemed a threat to security, peace, and public order.  The 
Minister explained that Raja Petra's detention came in the 
wake of various statements published by him in his blog 
"Malaysia Today," the latest being a commentary which 
allegedly ridiculed Islam and the Prophet Muhammad.  Syed 
Hamid stated, "We have called and advised him many times 
following the publishing of his statements but he has 
continued to write, so much so that they (the statements) 
could pose a threat (to security and public order)."  The 
Minister added that under Section 73(1) of the Act, Raja 
Petra would be detained for 60 days and the police will do an 
assessment during the period.  Syed Hamid added "if they feel 
he should be held more than 60 days, the police will then 
refer to me".  Traditionally the minister will accept the 
recommendations made by the police and sign the order under 
Section 8(1) of the Act, which allows the person to be 
detained for renewable two-year periods. 
¶4. (U) This is the second time Raja Petra has been detained 
under the ISA.  The government of then Prime Minister 
Mahathir detained Raja Petra under the ISA in April 2001 for 
his involvement in former DPM Anwar Ibrahim initiated 
"reformasi" movement.  He was held for 53 days before being 
unconditionally released, reportedly due to pressure from the 
King, the late Sultan of Selangor who was Raja Petra,s 
uncle.  The current Sultan of Selangor is his cousin. 
 
¶5. (U) Raja Petra's arrest came a day after the Cabinet 
ordered the Multimedia and Communications Commission (MCMC) 
to re-instate access to all blocked websites, including Raja 
Petra's "Malaysia Today" website (which was blocked on August 
27).  Energy, Water and Com-mu-nications Minister Shaziman 
Abu Mansor stated on September 12 that the Cabinet ordered 
the move because there were other "harsher" laws in the 
country, including the ISA, to "control the irresponsible 
dissemination of information over the Internet and to bring 
those irresponsible websites and blogs to book." 
 
¶6. (C) Comment:  Malaysia's on-line news sources and blogs 
have blossomed over recent years as an alternative to the 
government dominated mainstream media.  This trend has only 
increased after the March 8 elections, in which Abdullah and 
his UMNO party suffered a major setback.  Raja Petra is 
considered the most outspoken and controversial Internet 
journalist, and is often a proponent of opposition views. 
Aside from his ISA arrest, Raja Petra faces sedition charges 
for articles implicating Deputy Prime Minister Najib in an 
ongoing high profile murder case.  Raja Petra's 
arrest is another sign of insecurity on the part of Abdullah 
and the UMNO party.  The government's use of ISA sends a 
strong warning to other opposition bloggers to curb their 
activities.  This arrest may intimidate some activists, but 
it also could result in a backlash by the independent media 
and bloggers, and increase public disaffection with 
Abdullah's leadership. 
 
¶7.  (C) As PM Abdullah and his UMNO party become increasingly 
concerned over threats to bring down their government through 
the crossover of 30 more BN members of Parliament, Raja 
Petra's arrest also will be interpreted here as a warning to 
the political opposition and its leader Anwar Ibrahim. 
Opposition officials consistently have expressed concern that 
the government could invoke ISA if they advance too far. 
While not determinate given the fluid political situation and 
UMNO's disarray, today's arrest of Raja Petra lends support 
to the view that the UMNO-led government will take stern 
measures to defend itself.  End Comment. 
 
¶8.  (U) The Embassy offers the following draft "if asked" 
press guidance. 
 
Q:  WHAT IS THE U.S. REACTION TO THE ARREST TODAY (SEPTEMBER 
12) OF BLOGGER RAJA PETRA KAMARDUDDIN UNDER MALAYSIA'S 
INTERNAL SECURITY ACT (ISA)? 
 
A:  We understand from press accounts that Malaysian police 
detained Raja Petra, who is associated with the "Malaysia 
Today" website, under an article of the Internal Security Act 
covering threats to "security, peace, and public order". 
 
We cannot comment further on the specific grounds for the 
Malaysian government's actions. 
 
We are aware that Raja Petra also faces legal complaints and 
charges of sedition related to information posted on the 
website. 
 
The United States firmly believes that freedom of the press 
and freedom of speech are fundamental components of a vibrant 
democracy.  Freedom of expression is a basic right embodied 
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
 
The peaceful expression of political views is a cornerstone 
of democratic rights and practice, as is the impartial 
application of the rule of law. 
 
(IF ASKED SPECIFICALLY ON MALAYSIA'S USE OF THE INTERNAL 
SECURITY ACT) 
 
A:  As a matter of principle, we hope that countries refrain 
from using national security laws to curtail the peaceful 
expression of political views and media freedom.
