SUBJECT: ADDENDUM TO ORGANIZED CRIME IN IRELAND REPORT 
(C-CN5-00417) 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 146246 
 
     ¶B. DUBLIN 1196 
 
Classified By: POL/ECON CHIEF MARY DALY, FOR REASONS 1.4 (B), (D) 
 
¶1. (C)  Per ref A's request for continued information on 
organized crime elements in Ireland, Post offers the 
following updates from police sources who were available for 
comment after the drafting of ref B: 
 
¶2. (C) Irish police report Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese, and 
West African involvement in various organized criminal 
activity in Ireland.  Per ref B, each national group tends to 
interact primarily within its own ethnic community in 
Ireland. 
 
Russians 
-------- 
 
¶A.  According to the police, Russian owned companies in 
Canada conduct suspect financial banking and insurance 
transactions in Moldova and manufacture government documents 
for the Republic of Moldova.  These companies are registered 
in Ireland with Russian and Moldovan employees. 
 
Chinese 
------- 
 
¶B.  Irish police intelligence reports that members of two 
Triad Gangs, the Wo Shin Wo and the 14K operate in Ireland. 
According to the police, the Chinese tend to be active within 
their community and not draw public attention.  Their 
community participation is allegedly in casinos, trafficking 
women, and money laundering through restaurants and 
properties.  Police report a great deal of interaction 
between the Chinese in Ireland and the Chinese in Scotland. 
The police also report 'many incidents' with Chinese 
nationals' involvement in kidnappings, extortion and even 
murder within their own community.  These are rarely brought 
to the attention of the public and local Chinese tend not to 
cooperate with police investigations. 
 
West Africans 
------------ 
 
¶C.  The Irish police report that West African criminal gangs 
predominantly operate in the areas of drug trafficking, 
immigration offenses, credit card fraud and phone fraud. 
Police intelligence suspects that Ireland is a destination 
country for drug importation (mostly cocaine) organized by 
Nigerian criminals.  Cocaine is brought in by air, using 
couriers who tend to frequently bring in small amounts. 
Police also maintain suspicion that drugs may transit Ireland 
en route to the UK. 
 
¶D.  Irish police report that among the West African organized 
criminals, they see forged documents and multiple identities, 
used to facilitate both drug trafficking and illegal 
immigration.  For example, one Nigerian was arrested and 
found to have four false driving licenses, five bank accounts 
and at least 10 aliases.  He applied for political asylum 
four times in different names. 
 
¶E.  Of great concern to the Irish authorities is the 
potential exploitation of links between the UK and Ireland. 
In particular, police are concerned that criminals use 
ferries between the two countries to smuggle drugs and 
immigrants.  They report several instances of Nigerians and 
other West Africans attempting to enter the UK from Ireland 
at ferry ports, notably Stranraer, Scotland. 
 
¶3.  (C) Post would also note that the IRA's decommissioning 
in 2005 advances the peace process and the chances for a 
permanent political solution to the problems of Northern 
Ireland.  However, it also means that even if the 
organization is entering a new mode, individuals with 
experience in organized crime and terrorism remain in the 
Republic and may be involved in some of the gangland 
shootings in 2005. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Per ref A, the police report that there is little 
intelligence that any relationships exist between the 
above-mentioned groups and Irish organized crime.  Likewise, 
there is no intelligence that these groups cooperate among 
themselves, or that they are linked to terrorist groups in 
Ireland.  There is no evidence of corrupt relationships 
 
between these groups and Irish businessmen or government 
officials.
