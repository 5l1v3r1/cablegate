DEPLOYING TEAM 
 
REF: 04 STATE 265971 
 
Classified By: DCM JONATHAN BENTON FOR REASONS 1.4 AND D 
 
1.(U)  This is an action request.  Please see para 4. 
 
¶2. (S)  Keith McBean, Director of Security Policy at the 
Irish DFA, informed POL/ECON chief on January 11, that 
Ireland does not have sufficient resources to deploy an 
Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team to Afghanistan, as 
requested reftel.  According to McBean, the GOI is close to 
the 850 cap on forces it can deploy overseas, and EOD teams 
in particular are stretched thin.  McBean said that the GOI 
would instead like to offer advanced EOD training in Ireland. 
 
¶3.  (S) January 13, Defense Forces General Staff confirmed to 
DATT their interest in providing support for Afghan Army 
Explosive Ordnance Teams. They have instructors and 
facilities available in Ireland to assist.  The Defense 
Forces Ordnance Corps is responsible for operational EOD 
coverage to overseas missions, as well as within Ireland. 
The Ordnance Corps runs its own training program, which 
includes classroom and on the job training.  EOD Instructors 
at the Defense Forces Training Center function as members of 
operational teams on duty throughout the Republic and, as 
such, are heavily tasked.  Defense Staff contacts stressed 
that they have the capacity to offer training in Ireland and 
believe there are advantages in doing the training in a 
facility that offers all the technical requirements to 
develop experts in the field.  The Defense Staff feels it is 
prudent at this point to better define specific training 
requirements and may deploy an assessment team to Afghanistan 
to further examine the proposal. 
 
¶4. Please advise whether we should pursue Ireland's offer 
further.
