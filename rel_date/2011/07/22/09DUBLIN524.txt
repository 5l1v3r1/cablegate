¶1. (C) SUMMARY: In separate meetings on December 2 and 3, 
Kevin Conmy of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) 
and Paul McGarry of the Irish Prime Minister,s Office 
briefed us on ongoing talks between GOI and HMG about 
Northern Ireland.  The aim of these meetings is to follow up 
on the meeting between UK Prime Minister Brown and Irish 
Prime Minister Cowen on November 30 (ref).  What needs to be 
done, according to our interlocutors, is to decouple the 
devolution of policing and justice from any other issues 
(especially parades).  They said devolution must be agreed to 
before Christmas, or the whole process could break down. 
They are aware of the possibility of failure, but remain 
cautiously optimistic.  Conmy is Chief of the Reconciliation 
and Coordination Section of the Anglo-Irish Division of the 
DFA, and McGarry is in the Northern Ireland and International 
Division of the PM,s office.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------- 
IRISH FRUSTRATED WITH UNIONISTS 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) Both of our interlocutors reported frustration on the 
Irish side with Northern Ireland First Minister Peter 
Robinson. (of the Democratic Unionist Party ) DUP).  McGarry 
said that Robinson had made "abolition of the parades 
commission a pre-condition" for setting a date for devolution 
of policing and justice.  Having any precondition for 
devolution was unacceptable to Sinn Fein and rightly so, as 
Sinn Fein had stuck by its side of the bargain on devolution. 
 
--------------------------------- 
DE-LINKING DEVOLUTION AND PARADES 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Conmy and McGarry described the purpose of ongoing 
meetings between the Irish DFA and PM,s office and the 
British Northern Ireland Office (NIO) as devising an approach 
that would get the DUP and Sinn Fein talking about all of the 
St. Andrew,s Agreement issues (parades, Irish language, 
North-South all-island cooperation) separately from 
devolution.  Dealing with all of the St. Andrew,s issues as 
a package, they hoped, would bring Sinn Fein to the table on 
parades and enable Robinson to walk back from making parades 
a pre-condition for devolution.  What was needed, they said, 
was some sort of political declaration or commitment from 
Robinson before Christmas on a start date for devolution.  If 
Robinson did not commit to a start date before Christmas, 
they said, Sinn Fein might leave the Northern Ireland 
Executive and force early elections. 
 
------------------ 
A DRASTIC "PLAN B" 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (C) Our interlocutors added that the Irish and the NIO 
were also discussing a "Plan B," which would mean the British 
taking up de facto day-to-day governance of Northern Ireland 
in close collaboration with the Irish, in the event of a 
failure to reconstitute a functioning Northern Ireland 
executive after elections.  McGarry emphasized that Plan B 
would not come into effect before at least one, probably two, 
elections in Northern Ireland, and Conmy said Plan B was 
meant more as a way to pressure Robinson to cooperate with 
Sinn Fein and agree to devolution than as an imminent 
possibility. 
 
------------------------ 
CRITICISM OF THE BRITISH 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. (C) Both Conmy and McGarry (STRICTLY PROTECT) opined that 
the British had been too easy on Robinson, in effect allowing 
him to link parades with devolution.  Conmy (STRICTLY 
PROTECT) said Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin 
McGuinness (Sinn Fein) was upset about British Northern 
Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward's actions on a recent trip 
to the U.S.  Woodward had apparently complained to American 
interlocutors about McGuinness, being problematic.   The 
Americans had then called &their friends in Sinn Fein8 to 
report that. 
 
----------------------- 
VERY SOBERLY OPTIMISTIC 
----------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Our interlocutors summed up the situation as dicey, 
with a real chance of failure.  They maintained, though, that 
they were basically optimistic that they would find a way to

package the St. Andrew,s issues in a form that both Sinn 
Fein and Robinson could accept, and that would allow Robinson 
to agree to devolution by Christmas.
