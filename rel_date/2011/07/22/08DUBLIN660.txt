Classified By: Charge Robert J. Faucher; Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary: Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen will meet 
with other European Council leaders for the third time on 
December 11-12 to discuss the way forward following Ireland's 
defeat of the Lisbon Treaty in June 2008.  Cowen will seek 
continued patience and constructive ideas from the European 
Council; the European Council will be looking for a realistic 
roadmap.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) In recent weeks, the political focus in Ireland has 
shifted from the ongoing global financial crisis and 
accompanying domestic economic downturn (Ref A) back to the 
other most vexing political issue in Ireland: how to deal 
with the European Union following Ireland's defeat of the 
Lisbon Treaty in June 2008 (Refs B and C).  Over the past ten 
days, Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Brian Cowen has been 
touring European capitals (Stockholm, Helsinki, Berlin, 
London, Paris, Luxembourg) in an effort to pave the way for 
his meeting with the European Council on December 11 and 12. 
 
¶3.  (C) During a meeting on December 3, Martin Fraser, 
Foreign Affairs Advisor to the Prime Minister, told the 
Charge that Cowen intends to seek new, constructive ideas 
from the European Council during its December 11-12 meeting, 
as well as more time, to craft a resolution of the crisis. 
(Note:  Twice already, in June and October 2008, the European 
Council has granted Ireland "time for reflection" to study 
the outcome of the referendum and determine a way forward. 
Of the 27 EU member states, only Ireland and the Czech 
Republic have not fully ratified the Treaty.  End note.) 
Martin indicated that Cowen would offer to hold a second 
referendum on the Treaty if each EU member state is allowed 
to retain a full-time EU commissioner (one of the more 
resonant criticisms of the Treaty by the 'No' campaign during 
the June referendum).  Cowen will also be seeking assurances 
that Ireland's neutrality, abortion laws, and tax policies 
will not be infringed.  Martin added that Cowen would not 
agree to hold a second referendum until after the European 
Parliament election, which coincides with local elections in 
Ireland (Ref C). 
 
¶4.  (C) Martin reported that, in spite of some favorable 
press surrounding Cowen's recent travels and public 
statements by other EU leaders that they want to help Ireland 
find a solution, his European counterparts are beginning to 
take a harder line with him privately, insisting that he 
resolve the problem before the European Parliament elections 
in June 2009.  (Note:  Most EU member states want the 
European Parliament election to be conducted under the new 
Lisbon Treaty rules rather than the old Nice Treaty rules 
(Ref C).  End note.)  In Berlin on December 3, Cowen said, "I 
am hopeful that we can identify elements of an acceptable way 
forward for our European partners, but one that takes into 
account the grounds why the Irish people rejected the 
Treaty." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Meanwhile, Irish EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, 
responsible for EU internal market affairs, spoke out 
publicly on December 4, arguing that the rejection of the 
Treaty by Irish voters should be respected.  (Note: With an 
referendum turn-out of 53.1 percent of voters, 53.4 percent 
rejected the Treaty, while 46.6 percent approved it.  End 
note.)  McCreevy's influential voice makes it more difficult 
for Cowen to justify calling for a second referendum. 
 
¶6.  (C) Comment:  Cowen is struggling with a thorny problem 
-- how to move Ireland forward in harmony with the changes 
occurring within the EU (as reflected in the Treaty), while 
satisfying the expectations of Irish voters who soundly 
defeated the Treaty in June.  Meanwhile, European Council 
leaders appear increasingly unwilling to delay reforms 
throughout the entire EU solely to accommodate tiny Ireland, 
which has less than one percent of the EU's population. 
Cowen will seek continued patience and constructive ideas 
from the European Council during its December 11-12 meeting; 
the European Council will be looking for a realistic roadmap.
