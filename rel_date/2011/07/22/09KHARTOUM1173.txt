¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Sudanese authorities confirmed that two female 
aid workers who work for GOAL, an Irish non-governmental 
organization (NGO), were released early Sunday morning, October 18, 
after being held captive for 108 days. The two hostages, Irish 
national Sharon Cummins and Ugandan citizen Hilda Kawuki, were 
kidnapped on July 3 when armed gunmen invaded the GOAL compound in 
Kutum, North Darfur.  The Government of Sudan (GOS) informed the 
Embassy privately, and stated publicly, that no ransom was paid for 
their release.  United Nations Department of Safety and Security 
(UNDSS) officers did not have any additional details, but reported 
the negotiated release of the GOAL hostages has not affected the 
status or conditions for two UNAMID civilian employees held captive 
since the August 30 armed invasion of their compound in Zalingei, 
West Darfur.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Sudan's State Minister for Humanitarian Affairs, Abdel 
Baqi Al Jalani announced that GOAL aid workers, Irish national 
Sharon Cummins and Ugandan citizen Hilda Kawuki, had been released 
by their captors in the early morning hours on October 18.  The two 
were kidnapped on July 3 when armed gunmen invaded the GOAL compound 
in Kutum, North Darfur.  Al Jalani had been the chief negotiator for 
the Government of Sudan since the ordeal began 108 days ago. Al 
Jalani is expected to represent GOS at an Khartoum airport  press 
conference with the hostages as soon as they arrive on October 18. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Irish Honorary Consul informed the DCM that the two 
women were tired but appeared to be in good condition. The hostages 
were due to be returned in a private aircraft to Khartoum later in 
the day on October 18. He stated no ransom had been paid for the 
hostages' release.  The DCM reaffirmed the Embassy's past offer of 
medical assistance if needed. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Senior Presidential Advisor Dr. Ghazi Salah Edeen told the 
CDA that those responsible for the release were actually tribal 
leaders of those who organized the kidnapping.  He said GOS had made 
it clear to the tribal leaders that this act would not go unpunished 
if it were not resolved.  The tribal leaders subsequently leaned on 
the kidnappers to let the women go.  Ghazi confirmed previous 
reports from Al Jalani and the Irish that no ransom was paid. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) 
contacts informed the RSO that the negotiations for the release of 
the GOAL hostages has not had any impact on the status of the two UN 
civilian employees who were also kidnapped during an armed invasion 
of their compound in Zalingei, West Darfur on August 30.  According 
to a report provided to the RSO by a UN contact, the March 11 
kidnapping of three Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) western expatriate 
workers, the April 4 kidnapping of a Canadian and French Assistance 
Medicale International (AMI) staff, and the July 3 GOAL kidnapping 
were all carried out by members of the Mahamid tribe, whereas the 
August 30 UN kidnappers allegedly are members of the Iraygat tribe. 
The UN report indicates that both the Mahamid and Iraygat belong to 
the broad, "Northern Rizaygat" tribe. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Post will continue to monitor the status of the UNAMID 
hostage taking incident and will follow-up with the Irish and 
Ugandans for any information gathered from the two hostages just 
released.  Updates will be sent via septel.
