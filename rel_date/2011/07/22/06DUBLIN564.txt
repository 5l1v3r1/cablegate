Classified By: Pol/Econ Chief Mary E. Daly, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) On May 18, emboff delivered ref A points to Irish 
Department of Foreign Affairs Sub-Saharan Africa Section 
First Secretary Anne Byrne.  Byrne said that the GOI supports 
the Darfur Peace Agreement and the African Union's push for a 
transition to a UN peacekeeping force.  She added that 
Ireland is demonstrating that support through the following: 
 
Humanitarian Assistance 
----------------------- 
 
--Irish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern remarked in a May 4 
parliamentary question session that in 2004-2005, Ireland 
contributed euro 1.5m to humanitarian, human rights and 
policing aspects of the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) 
and the EU provided an additional euro 160m in support 
through the African Peace Facility.  He also said that the EU 
will soon support AMIS with a further euro 50m.  He added 
that in 2005 Ireland provided almost euro 3m in emergency 
funding for humanitarian needs in Darfur alone and over euro 
2m has been provided so far this year for the same purpose. 
According to the Foreign Minister, at Ireland's initiative, 
EU ambassadors in Khartoum have been requested to raise the 
need for improved humanitarian access directly with the 
Sudanese authorities. 
 
Military Support 
---------------- 
 
--Byrne said that Ireland currently has three members of the 
Irish Permanent Defense Forces serving in the African Union 
Mission in Sudan (AMIS).  She added that another officer 
served in AMIS in 2004-2005, making four military personnel 
in total. 
 
 
Irish JEM Connection 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) Per ref B., emboff queried Byrne on the status of 
Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) Secretary of Training and 
Strategic Planning Irish resident Dr. Abdullahi El-Tom. 
According to Byrne, the GOI is having difficulties locating 
El-Tom.  She said that he is not in Ireland, and is likely to 
be in Abuja, Khartoum or Addis Ababa.  She added that once 
the GOI establishes contact with him, he will be encouraged 
to influence JEM to sign to the Darfur Peace Agreement.
