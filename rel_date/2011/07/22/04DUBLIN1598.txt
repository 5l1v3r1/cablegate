Classified By: POL/ECON COUNSELOR MARY DALY FOR 
REASONS 1.4.(B) AND (D) 
 
1.(C) Summary. Emboff, drawing on reftel points, spoke on 
October 19 to Maurice Biggar, Deputy Director for 
International Terrorism & Illicit Drugs and his colleague, 
Eoin Duggan, at the DFA.  According to Biggar and Duggan the 
USG domestic designation of IARA is an issue of concern as it 
targets an Irish citizen, Ibrahim Buisir.  The GOI has no 
information on JTJ operations within Ireland.  The IARA 
designation came as a surprise, but not an unwelcome one. 
Ireland does not currently have legal recourse to freeze 
assets of suspected terrorism financiers.  The GOI also does 
not have far-reaching intelligence capabilities, so greatly 
appreciates information-sharing and cooperation with the USG. 
 If both such designations are approved through the UN 1267 
Sanctions Committee, the EU will follow suit, thereby 
requiring legal action in Ireland and allowing Irish 
authorities to freeze assets of Buisir.  The Irish are likely 
to welcome such action.  End Summary.

List 62: The Islamic African Relief Agency (IARA), Ibrahim 
Buisir 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
2.(C) Biggar had no new information to report regarding the 
IARA; however, Ibrahim Buisir, who was named last week as 
having ties to Al-Qaeda, is certainly of interest as a dual 
Irish-Libyan with links to terrorist financing.  Buisir's 
designation on the US domestic list came as a surprise to the 
Irish, and the Irish government would have appreciated a 
heads up.  That said, the Irish also consider Buisir to be a 
problem.  Recently, they tried to prosecute him for credit 
card fraud but he was released on a technicality.  He is now 
living on welfare. 
 
3.(C) The USG domestic designation of Buisir does not change 
his status.  As an Irish citizen, he is free to move his 
assets and to travel, both within country and abroad. 
Current Irish law does not allow for the arrest of an 
individual suspected of terrorism financing unless the EU has 
designated the person.  (Note: A criminal and terrorism law 
is pending ratification this fall.)  If the USG designation 
is pursued and approved by the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee, 
the EU will automatically adopt it, allowing Ireland's 
Central Bank legal means to freeze his assets.  The process 
from the EU approval to Irish application usually takes a 
matter of days.  The Irish are likely to welcome this 
designation. 
 
4.(C) Buisir has successfully used the press to gain sympathy 
in the past.  The DFA has concerns that he may do so again, 
claiming persecution by the USG.  To date, though, only one 
article has made it in the press regarding the designation 
and Buisir has refrained from public comments. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
List 63: Jama'at Al-Tawhid Wa'al-Jihad (JTJ) 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5.(U) The GOI has no information on current activities of 
Jama'at Al-Tawhid Wa'al-Jihad (JTJ) in Ireland.  The DFA 
welcomes this designation and information sharing on 
terrorism financing.  Biggar emphasized that, as with Buisir, 
the Irish government cannot act until the UN and EU have 
acted. 
 
---------------- 
Working Together 
---------------- 
 
¶6. For the purposes of better understanding the GOI, it is 
important to highlight the eagerness and willingness the DFA 
expressed regarding the fight against terrorism.  Biggar 
mentioned that the DFA and the Gardai (Irish national police) 
do not have as close a working relationship as they would 
like. As a result, information sharing is limited and rare. 
Thus, the USG briefings with the DFA are well received and 
appreciated.  The free flow of information is always welcome.
