¶3.  (C) SUMMARY:  Secretary Clinton discussed a wide 
range of issues, including Afghanistan, U.S. visa 
policy, and Irish acceptance of Guantanamo detainees in 
an October 11 meeting with Ireland's Foreign Minister 
Michael Martin.   END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
AFGHANISTAN:  IRISH WANT TO HELP 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Secretary Clinton highlighted the 
Administration's Afghanistan review.  Minister Martin 
offered Ireland's help in promoting efforts in 
Afghanistan and explained that Ireland has recently 
hosted an Afghan parliamentary delegation at the 
reconciliation center at Glencree.  Ireland would be 
delighted to host similar efforts in the future. 
 
--------------------- 
VISAS AND IMMIGRATION 
--------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Secretary Clinton noted some form of an amnesty 
program for those illegally in the United States would 
be part of comprehensive immigration reform legislation. 
Minister Martin confirmed that according to Irish 
diaspora lobby groups there are currently 50,000 
undocumented Irish in the United States.  There did not 
appear to be a new wave of illegal immigration to the 
United States; Irish policy was committed to preventing 
a new wave of illegal immigration by using certain visa 
programs.  He also understood that efforts in this 
regard would likely be in the context of comprehensive 
immigration reform rather than a bi-lateral agreement. 
Martin praised the recent 12 month interim work and 
travel program implemented in January 2008 by Ireland 
 
PARTO 00000006  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
and the United States, and suggested it be reviewed 
after one year.  He also suggested that Ireland be added 
to the E-3 visa program (currently available only to 
Australians) with a reciprocal program for Americans to 
work in Ireland. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
TAX CODE REFORM: IRELAND NOT A TAX HAVEN 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Minister Martin highlighted concern that 
possible U.S. tax code reform could have a punitive 
effect on U.S. companies based in Ireland, costing jobs. 
Ireland is a low tax country, with a corporate tax rate 
of 12.5 percent for both Irish and foreign companies, 
not subject to change by the EU, but is not a tax haven, 
Martin stressed.  U.S. investment in Ireland had done 
much more than create direct jobs; it had resulted in 
the development of an enterprise culture in Ireland, he 
added. 
 
------------------ 
DONOR COORDINATION 
------------------ 
 
¶7.  (C) Turning to donor coordination and food security 
policy, Secretary Clinton stressed an integrated whole- 
government approach to maximize effects and told Martin 
that previous restrictions on funding to certain 
organizations had been lifted, resulting in greater 
flexibility and effectiveness.  There have been great 
successes in certain areas such as PEPFAR.  However, in 
order to make progress against HIV/AIDS, greater efforts 
are needed to rationalize donor approaches -- both in 
the U.S. government and in the wider donor community -- 
in order to avoid duplication and maximize outputs. 
Minister Martin concurred and suggested that Ireland and 
the U.S. co-host an event at a future UN Development 
Goals Summit. 
 
------------------------------ 
KIDNAPPED AID WORKER IN DARFUR 
------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  (C) Minister Martin thanked the U.S. for supporting 
efforts to recover Irish aid worker Sharon Commins who 
was kidnapped by bandits in Darfur on July 3rd. 
According to Martin, U.S. interlocutors in Sudan were 
the most knowledgeable about the situation, and 
Khartoum's apparent willingness but inability to secure 
the kidnapped aid worker's release may show that 
Khartoum is no longer in control of tribal groups in 
Darfur. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
FORMER GUANTANAMO DETAINEES SETTLING IN WELL 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (C) Secretary Clinton praised the Irish acceptance 
of two former Guantanamo detainees, and noted that Irish 
policy of allowing family members to join them in 
Ireland would likely have the positive effect of easing 
the transition into Irish society.

information India could, and it was up to Pakistan to 
take it to its "logical conclusion." 
 
¶11.  (C) Krishna said he would meet September 27 with 
Pakistan Foreign Minister Qureshi.  He said that he 
would again offer Indian assistance, because "terror 
knows no boundaries."  He repeated PM Singh's statement 
that India is willing to go more than half way in the 
"hope to take up from where we left" with respect to the 
composite dialogue.  The Secretary said that we consider 
all Pakistan-based terror groups a threat to regional 
and international security.  She recounted that the 
United States had been working with Pakistan to close 
down terrorist operations.  While we had seen some good 
developments, she observed, we expect Pakistan to do 
more.  She said the Indian offer of cooperation and 
assistance to Pakistan was an important gesture to make 
clear that the two countries had a common cause. 
 
----------- 
AFGHANISTAN 
----------- 
 
¶12.  (C) Krishna said India had been providing 
assistance at the invitation of Afghanistan.  He averred 
that India had no hidden agenda or vested interest in 
the country and was only there to help rebuild 
infrastructure.  He queried why some countries would 
think otherwise.  The Secretary expressed appreciation 
with India's assistance in Afghanistan and said the best 
way to dispel allegations about India's possible role in 
Baluchistan would be to address them directly with 
Qureshi.  Krishna said he would do so and expressed the 
hope that it could be a "path-breaking" meeting. 
 
--------- 
SRI LANKA 
--------- 
 
¶13.  (C) The Secretary sought Indian assistance to 
persuade the Government of Sri Lanka (GSL) to resettle 
the internally displaced persons in Sri Lanka.  Krishna 
said India had had considerable interactions with the 
GSL.  While describing the IDP situation as a 
humanitarian concern, he did not think the GSL could 
meet the 180-day timeline to relocate the IDPs because 
the monsoon would start soon.  Moreover, demining the 
areas to give people the confidence to return to their 
homes would take time. 
 
---- 
IRAN 
---- 
 
¶14.  (C) Drawing his attention to the President's 
statement earlier in the day regarding the disclosure of 
a new Iranian nuclear facility, the Secretary told 
Krishna that the United States still planned to attend 
the October 1 meeting with Iran.  She also welcomed 
Russia's strong statement on the matter.
