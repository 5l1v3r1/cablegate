SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (C) On December 7, DCM met with Rory Montgomery, 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Political Director to 
follow up on the December 1 meeting between Foreign Minister 
Dermot Ahern and Secretary Rice in Washington, parliamentary 
pressure to search U.S. aircraft in transit at Shannon 
airport, and the December 15 Iraqi elections.  Montgomery 
stated that Minister Ahern was pleased with his meeting with 
Secretary Rice.  He added that the GOI continues to take it 
 
SIPDIS 
on faith that there have been no changes in U.S. practices at 
Shannon and the GOI will not conduct searches of authorized 
state aircraft.  Nonetheless, he cited pressure from 
parliament to inspect U.S. carriers and asked the USG to 
clarify its interpretation of international law and 
sovereignty governing searches of state and state contracted 
aircraft.  DCM also delivered reftel points on Iraqi 
elections.  The GOI will issue a supportive statement in the 
December 14 parliament session.

MEETING WITH SECRETARY RICE AND U.S. USE OF SHANNON 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶3.  (C) Montgomery noted that Minister Ahern was very pleased 
with his meeting with Secretary Rice, during which topics 
such as the Iraq war, extradition, and U.S. state aircraft 
stopovers in Shannon were discussed.  Montgomery also greatly 
appreciated his meeting with EUR Principal Deputy Assistant 
Secretary Kurt Volker.  He expressed understanding of the 
 
SIPDIS 
U.S. approach to EU concerns about renditions, and he said 
that the GOI took it on faith that there had been no changes 
in U.S. practices regarding transits at Shannon airport. 
Montgomery expressed mild concern over Secretary Rice's 
speeches during her European tour which defend USG practices, 
not only in Shannon, but throughout Europe, but which also 
emphasize the Government's commitment to the War on Terror, 
in effect making the first point less persuasive, in his 
view.

ACTION REQUEST: 
GOI SEEKS LEGAL OPINION ON SEARCH OF U.S. AIRCRAFT 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4.  (C) The Irish parliament has been pressuring the GOI 
relentlessly to inspect US aircraft using Shannon. 
Anticipating more questions on December 14, Montgomery asked 
for clarification of the U.S. Government's interpretation of 
international law and sovereignty principles that applied to 
state/contract aircraft searches.  He said that that would be 
a valuable tool in guiding the GOI,s actions and policy. 
Montgomery stated that the GOI's current interpretation, and 
approach when questioned by parliament, of the legality of 
these searches is similar to the stopping of a vehicle on the 
road by police: neither would be done, in normal 
circumstances, without suspicion.  The GOI has told 
parliament it has no grounds for suspicion and thus does not 
plan to inspect aircraft.  Per Montgomery's request, please 
advise and provide post with talking points on USG 
interpretation of the legality of searches of this type. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
IRAQI ELECTIONS: GOI TO ISSUE SUPPORTIVE STATEMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  (C) DCM asked the GOI for a public statement supporting 
the December 15 Iraqi elections (ref A). Montgomery stated 
that the GOI is supportive of the upcoming Iraqi elections 
and the work underway to make them possible.  Montgomery 
noted previous intense debates within the GOI concerning the 
Iraq war, but added that the Government had begun to balance 
internal criticism by accentuating positive developments, 
including the upcoming elections. 
 
¶6.  (C) In a follow-up call by emboff, DFA's Deputy Regional 
Director of the Middle East and North Africa, Stephen Dawson, 
confirmed Montgomery's sentiment and stated that the GOI will 
issue an official statement in next week's Parliament 
 
DUBLIN 00001516  002 OF 002 
 
 
sessions expressing anticipation of the December 15 elections 
and wishing luck to the Iraqi people.  Ireland will likely be 
represented by an EU post-election statement.  An individual 
GOI statement, although unlikely, will depend on the outcome 
of elections and the following events.
