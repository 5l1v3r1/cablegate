SUBJECT: IRELAND UNLIKELY TO ACCEPT GITMO UIGHURS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 183800 
 
Classified By: DCM JONATHAN S. BENTON, FOR REASONS 1.4 (B), (D) 
 
¶1. (S)  In a private meeting October 7, the Ambassador 
delivered reftel points to Dermot Gallagher, Secretary 
General of the DFA.  Gallagher frankly told the ambassador 
that Ireland would not accept GITMO Uighurs because of their 
bad experience with the Church of the Nativity occupier they 
had accepted.  (Note:  The USG and GOI suspect Jihad Ja'arah, 
of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Battalion, of ongoing terrorist 
activity.) 
 
¶2.  (S)  On October 11, emboff delivered the same demarche at 
the working level.  Department of Foreign Affairs Human 
Rights Section First Secretary Gavan O'Leary and Asia and 
Oceania Deputy Director James McIntyre said that they needed 
to consult internally with other sections and then with the 
Department of Justice's Reception and Integration section 
before taking a decision on accepting Uighurs from Guantanamo 
Bay.  Notwithstanding their response, SecGen Gallagher's 
clear "no" to the ambassador is likely to stand.
