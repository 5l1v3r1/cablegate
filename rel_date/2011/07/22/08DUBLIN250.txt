TO MOVE TO THE NORTH 
 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Section Chief Ted Pierce; 
Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1.  (U) On April 14, Irish Finance Minister Brian Cowen (who 
will become Ireland,s next Prime Minister on May 7) and 
Northern Ireland Finance Minister Peter Robinson (who will 
become the FirstMinister of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 
Jun) announced that their respective governments would 
facilitate the move of up to 5,000 financial serices jobs 
from Dublin to Northern Ireland.  Robison noted that, "for anumber of months now Bria and I have had meetings, 
correspondence, and ou officials working together to arrive 
at this postion."  The Ministers highlighted this new 
inititive as another example of expanding North-Southcooperation. 
 
¶2.  (C) On April 16, ECONOFF spoke with Kevin Cardiff, Second 
Secretary General in the Irish Department of Finance, about 
the joint announcement.  Cardiff said that the Irish 
government did not intend to make any legal, regulatory, or 
tax changes to facilitate the move of jobs to the North. 
Rather, he said, the announcement was intended to "create the 
right atmosphere and to signal that the Dublin authorities 
would not block companies from moving some jobs to Northern 
Ireland."  He noted that, for the most part, jobs that move 
North would likely have been lost to the Republic of Ireland 
anyway. 
 
¶3.  (C) Cardiff said that what was unsaid -) but very much 
part of the thinking of those who crafted the announcement -- 
was that if jobs were going to move from the Republic, Irish 
officials "would much prefer they go to Belfast than Poland." 
 He said that the Irish government also looked at this 
initiative as creating a bridge for Irish firms to hook more 
strongly into the broader UK market. 
 
¶4.  (C) Cardiff noted that not all Northern Ireland officials 
were in agreement with the value of this announcement. 
(Comment:  There are significant pockets of unionism that see 
stronger links with the South as an end-run to subjugate 
unionist communities in the North.  End Comment)  Cardiff 
also said that some in the North wanted Dublin to explicitly 
state that moving jobs to Belfast was preferable to moving 
them to other parts of the EU, but he added that no one in 
the Department of Finance seriously considered such a 
statement, which "would run afoul of EU law."  Cardiff's 
personal view was that, if Belfast is going to build up its 
financial services sector, it needs to look beyond Dublin and 
become a service provider for other nearby financial centers, 
such as London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. 
 
¶5.  (C) Comment:  While this announcement was genuine in 
terms of the Irish Government,s wish to promote economic 
growth in the North, and certainly added luster to 
North-South cooperation, it was also mildly disingenuous. 
Ireland currently has a surplus of skilled labor in the 
financial services sector, in part because economic growth in 
Ireland has begun to flatten out.  &The wink and the nod8 
between Cowen and Robinson to keep such labor resources on 
the island, rather then encouraging professional Irish to 
branch out into the EU, keeps this valuable resource close to 
home.
