¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  After the August 29 court hearing in Tripoli 
(ref), Bulgarian officials are showing signs of guarded 
optimism that the current judicial process may run its course 
before the end of September.  This would open the way for a 
political decision to return to Bulgaria the six nurses 
imprisoned since 1999 on charges of deliberately spreading 
the HIV virus in Benghazi.  The GOB is keeping a low 
public-affairs profile as the process unfolds, and counts on 
continued behind-the-scenes pressure on Libya from the U.S. 
and EU.  The MFA thanked us for the Department's August 29 
statement in support of the nurses.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) We met August 30 with Petko Doykov, the director of 
the MFA's Middle East Department, to discuss the results of 
the previous day's court hearing in Tripoli.  Doykov said the 
latest trial is unfolding according to Bulgarian 
expectations.  He believes the court will hold one or two 
more hearings and reach a verdict "in mid September."  Doykov 
said that at the last session of the four-party talks with 
Libya, Bulgaria emphasized that reaffirmation of the death 
penalty would be an unacceptable outcome.  Instead, the GOB 
hopes to see sentences ranging between 15 years to life 
imprisonment.  There is no expectation that the nurses will 
be found not guilty or otherwise set free by the current 
court.  On the other hand, reaffirmation of the death 
sentences would put the Bulgarian government in a difficult 
political position, according to Doykov, forcing it to 
respond publicly.  The tenor of the Bulgarian response will 
also be influenced by the proximity of presidential 
elections, scheduled to take place October 22. 
 
¶3. (C) In either case, Bulgaria believes it has a tacit 
understanding with Libya and the other parties to the talks 
that the nurses will be returned to Bulgaria in short order 
following the conclusion of the trial.  Most likely, this 
would involve allowing the nurses to "serve out their 
sentences" in Bulgaria according to the terms of the two 
countries' bilateral agreement on prisoner exchanges.  Less 
likely would be an outright pardon, perhaps in connection 
with the beginning of Ramadan o/a September 22-23.  If the 
best-case scenario does not materialize, Doykov surmised that 
the nurses would have to wait until after Ramadan for the 
Higher Judicial Council -- a political body chaired by the 
Minister of Justice -- to act. 
 
¶4. (C) Doykov said that the bi-weekly court appearances were 
taking a heavy psychological toll on the five nurses, several 
of whom were already in poor health after seven years in 
Libyan prisons.  Meanwhile, the GOB is pushing ahead with 
plans for a meeting of the Bulgaria-Libya Joint Commission 
focusing on economic issues, which last met in 1999.  A team 
of Libyan officials headed by the chief of the MFA's 
Directorate for International Cooperation is scheduled to 
visit Sofia September 19-20.  The Bulgarians consider the 
timing of the visit a positive sign.  On the parallel issue 
of debt forgiveness, "the paperwork has already been 
completed" to forgive Libya's debt to Bulgaria.  All that is 
required is a formal decision by the Council of Ministers to 
forgive the debt -- estimated at roughly USD 27 million -- 
once the nurses are released.  The Bulgarians intention is to 
package this as part of the Benghazi process. 
 
¶5. (C) COMMENT.  Bulgarians are not prone to optimism even in 
the best of circumstances, but Doykov was the least 
pessimistic that we have ever seen him.  The Bulgarians 
clearly believe they are approaching the end-game in this 
seven-year saga. At the same time, Doykov asked for continued 
strong U.S. and EU engagement until the nurses are released. 
The Bulgarians are convinced that the U.S. is the only party 
with enough leverage to convince Libya to step up to the 
plate and take what may be a politically difficult decision 
to send these five nurses back to Bulgaria.  END COMMENT
