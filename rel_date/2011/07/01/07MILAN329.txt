¶1.  (SBU) Roberto Formigoni, President of Lombardy Region, 
told the CG that Italian investors are on board to finance a 
new airline as a joint venture with an American carrier.  He 
promised the Italians will put up the cash if the Americans 
put up the expertise.  Formigoni is keen to replace Alitalia 
flights cut from Malpensa (see ref B), and hopes a fifty-one 
percent Italian-owned company run by a reputable American 
carrier is the answer.  The Region intends Malpensa to remain 
an intercontinental hub and not a regional European airport. 
So far, only short-haul airlines such as RyanAir, EasyJet, 
and Volare have expressed interest in Alitalia's 
soon-to-be-vacant slots at Malpensa.  The Lombardy Region is 
also in talks with Lufthansa to increase its intercontinental 
flights.  (Comment:  Post questions whether Lufthansa would 
add anything other than feeder flights at Malpensa given 
their massive, nearby hub in Munich.  End comment.) 
 

¶2.  (SBU)  Roberto Cattaneo, Lombardy Region Commissioner for 
Transportation called for American airlines to increase their 
service to and from Malpensa at a Post-hosted discussion with 
Continental, US Airways and American Airlines.  Cattaneo 
quickly ran through an economic analysis of Malpensa's 
current and projected future traffic and explained 
infrastructure enhancement projects planned for the airport. 
The US airlines were noncommittal, noting it will be hard to 
convince their headquarters to expand service at Malpensa. 


¶3.  (SBU)  Comment: Formigoni is seriously worried about the 
future of a post-Alitalia Malpensa.  Post believes the Region 
is still working hard behind the scenes to get Alitalia to 
reconsider their flight cuts, but they are actively looking 
for other solutions.  Formigoni's offer to connect an 
American airline with Italian financiers for a joint venuture 
is a serious one, and Formigoni would put his considerable 
political clout behind such a venture if an American carrier 
were interested.  End comment.
