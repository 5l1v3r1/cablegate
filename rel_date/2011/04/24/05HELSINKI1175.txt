(U)  Poloff spoke with officials in the MFA's Latin America 
Bureau about the pending elections in Bolivia.  Finland does 
not have an Embassy in La Paz or any current development 
projects inside the country.  The GoF does not expect to play 
a leading role in Bolivia Support Group (BSG) discussions or 
EU consultations.  However, Finland shares U.S. concerns and 
and supports the text contained in reftel.  Finland also 
supported the Oct.31 EU Presidency statement on Bolivia.
