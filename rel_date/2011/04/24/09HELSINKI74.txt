SUBJECT: FINLAND:  POSSIBLE RWANDAN GENOCIDE TRIAL 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  On February 5, local media reported that 
Finnish police referred their investigation of genocide 
charges against a Rwandan resident in Finland for 
prosecution. Finnish officials investigated the charges after 
the Rwandan applied for asylum in Finland.  Officials allege 
that the suspect is responsible for mass killings of 5,000 to 
25,000 people; charges he denies. The small Rwandan community 
in Finland offered no protest or public response to the 
police referral.  The Finnish government rejected the Rwandan 
government's extradition request.  The case may go to trial 
as soon as late March.  End summary. 
 
Discovery of Genocide Allegations 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On February 5, the Finnish Press reported the 
culmination of an investigation by the Finnish National 
Bureau of Investigation (NBI) into Francois Uzaramba (aka 
Bazaramba), a Rwandan-born resident suspected of taking part 
in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.  Prior media reports on the 
arrest noted that Finnish investigators first visited the 
crime scene in February 2007 and viewed evidence termed 
"overwhelming." In May 2007, two Finnish police reportedly 
traveled to Rwanda to gather evidence, with cooperation from 
Rwandan and UN authorities, including interviews of more than 
100 people in Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Congo, 
Malawi, Zambia and South Africa. Media reports have estimated 
the number of deaths at 5,000 to 25,000. (Note: Under Finnish 
law, the charge of genocide carries no requirement of a 
minimum number of victims.  End note.)  NBI also worked with 
the U.S. Department of Justice, Special Investigations 
Department.  Officials have not alleged how Uzaramba 
accomplished the 1994 mass killings, but have described Human 
Rights Watch's reporting of the events as nearly accurate. 
Some press reports allege that Uzaramba led one massacre and 
abetted another, in the area of Nyakizu Hill in the former 
Butare Province, Rwanda.  At the culmination of the 
investigation, NBI submitted 4,000 pages of investigation 
material to the state prosecutor for use in a possible trial. 
 
 
Suspect Remains in Finland 
--------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Uzaramba, in Finnish prison since April 2007, 
denies the charges against him.  The Finnish Ministry of 
Justice has started the Finnish trial preparation process. A 
trial could start in late March. Rwanda has no extradition 
treaty with Finland, but Rwandan authorities asked for 
extradition in this case.  The Finnish Ministry of Justice 
(MOJ) said that Finland will not extradite the Rwandan man 
based on decisions made last year by the International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), when it rejected three 
requests to return defendants to Rwanda because it was not 
satisfied that they would received a fair trial.  Based on a 
February 6 conversation with a Finnish NBI official, Rwanda 
could conceivably continue with a separate legal process.  In 
the same conversation, the Finnish official noted that 
Finland rejected Uzaramba's request for asylum.  He has 
appealed. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Finnish officials confirmed to PolAsst that 
Uzaramba will remain in custody pending and during trial and 
if convicted, serve his sentence in Finland.  Finnish law 
(Penal Code, Chapter 11, War Crimes and Offenses Against 
Humanity Section 1 Genocide) provides penalties from four 
years to life imprisonment.  Finland implemented the UN 
Genocide Convention within the Finnish Penal Code and the law 
applies to offenses committed outside of the country. 
Finnish officials noted that the statute is not common among 
European countries, not even EU member states. 
 
Uzaramba (aka Bazaramba) 
------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) According to media reports, Uzaramba moved to 
Finland in 2003.  He reportedly was a leading figure in the 
Rwandan Baptist Church and believed to be personally 
acquainted with President Juvenal Habyarimana.  Uzaramba's 
wife also resides in Finland.  Finland has a very small 
Rwandan community, roughly 39 residents; the community has 
not publicly responded to the allegations against Uzaramba.
