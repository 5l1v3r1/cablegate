¶1. (SBU) On April 4, Ambassador Ware met with Finland's 
Minister of Environment Jan-Erik Enestam.  Minister Enestam 
reiterated his high regard for the transatlantic 
relationship and said that he had invited OES A/S Claudia 
McMurray to visit Finland in advance of Finland's EU 
presidency, which begins in June 2006.  He confirmed that 
climate change would be a top priority for the Finnish 
presidency, particularly in terms of reaching out to non- 
Kyoto countries, including the U.S., China and India.  He 
underlined the importance of a broad approach to climate 
change that addresses production and consumption issues. 
 
¶2. (SBU) He was quick, however, to point to "Finnish 
pragmatism" and readiness to look for common ground with the 
U.S. outside of a Kyoto or Kyoto-like agreement.  He 
recognized the importance of research cooperation (such as 
the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment) and the development of 
new technology.  He was particularly keen to find a mutual 
approach to India and China energy questions.  "They need to 
be brought to a sustainable energy future," he said, 
stressing the need for China to move away from coal-powered 
energy.  Of particular value, he suggested, would be 
cooperation on energy efficiency.  He explained that Finland 
would be hosting an energy efficiency conference on 
September 11-12 called "Audit 06," where they intend to 
launch a global development program (World Audit Program) 
that seeks to eliminate energy wastage, particularly in 
India and China, through a forum allowing for exchange of 
best practices.  He welcomed U.S. participation (and 
speakers) in this conference. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment.  In light of Finland's expressed (non- 
politicized) willingness to find common ground on climate 
issues, Finland's EU presidency may be a valuable 
opportunity to steer the EU climate discussion in a 
direction more compatible with U.S. priorities.  We strongly 
encourage U.S. participation in Audit 06, and feel that it 
would introduce a strong and practical energy component to 
the transatlantic climate dialogue.  Perhaps a U.S.-EU 
energy dialogue meeting immediately before or after the 
conference could pay dividends.  End comment.
