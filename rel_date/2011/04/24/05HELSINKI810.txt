(U)  Poloff delivered points in reftels to Finnish officials 
in the MFA's Refugee Affairs Office.  The Finns were aware of 
the situation and said that it was likely Finland would 
accept a limited number of the Uzbek asylum seekers, perhaps 
10-15.  According to Finnish officials, the country had only 
a small remaining number of "discretionary" spaces in its 
quota system for asylum seekers/refugees, and was already 
processing several other cases as well.  Moreover, a certain 
number of spaces were probably going to be reserved for 
possible "Mari" refugees (NOTE:  The 'Mari' are a small 
Finno-Ugric ethnic group on Russia who have recently made 
headlines in Finland alleging discrimination by Russians 
against them).  The Finnish MFA said that it was already 
working with the UNHCR on logistics regarding the Uzbeks.
