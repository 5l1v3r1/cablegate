¶1.  (SBU)  The Department of Foreign Affairs has shared with 
Embassy copies of letters dated January 31 to the resident 
Ambassadors of Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, 
Sweden, and the Netherlands, requesting technical assistance 
as the Philippine government investigates and tries to 
resolve extrajudicial and other "unexplained" killings, 
following recommendations from the Presidentially-appointed 
Melo Commission (refs).  (Full text of identical letters in 
para 2.)  Separately, Norway, which has been unsuccessfully 
trying to facilitate peace talks between the Philippine 
government and the Communist Party of the Philippines and the 
National Democratic Front, privately expressed interest to 
Pol/C in exploring additional assistance, perhaps financial 
support to the Philippine Department of Justice's expanded 
witness protection program.  Embassy will continue to consult 
with counterparts in Manila about possible new assistance 
from these and other countries, as well as to explain ongoing 
USG efforts, including expanded aid to the Philippine 
Commission on Human Rights and strategic reform programs for 
the military, police, and judiciary. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Text of request letters 
quote 
 
31 January 2007 
 
Excellency, 
In an effort to address the concerns of the international 
community on the so-called unexplained killings in the 
Philippines, I have the honor to inform you that the 
Government of the Republic of the Philippines would welcome 
any technical assistance that could be extended by the (name 
of country), to facilitate and expedite the work of the Melo 
Commission. 
 
I wish also to inform Your Excellency that we have conveyed 
to other EU member-states that we welcome similar assistance, 
as previously offered during the 28 November 2006 briefing on 
the matter.  It is hoped that, with the various experiences 
and expertise each government has on such issues, all cases 
will be resolved soon with due diligence. 
 
Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
/s/ Albert G. Romulo 
The Secretary of Foreign Affairs
