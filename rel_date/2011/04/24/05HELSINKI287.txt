¶1. (U) In a March 6 interview with local television, Finnish 
Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja said that withdrawal of 
Syrian troops to the Biqa' is insufficient.  Tuomioja 
stressed that Syrian troops must move to the Syrian side of 
the border, and added the following: 
 
"It is not a question of a day or two, but it should start 
without delay.  If Hizballah sticks to peaceful protests, it 
should not endanger this process.  Hizballah is a political 
party, which is represented in the Lebanese Parliament.  But 
it represents a minority position." 
 
¶2. (U) In a March 7 conversation with Finnish MFA Under 
Secretary for Political Affairs Markus Lyra, the Ambassador 
 
SIPDIS 
expressed appreciation for the FM's statement on the need for 
Syrian withdrawal, and urged the GoF to continue such 
statements.  The Ambassador stressed, however, that 
withdrawal must begin immediately, and be finished by the 
time of the Lebanese Parliamentary elections.  Withdrawal 
must also include Syrian intelligence personnel, to rid 
Lebanon of their pernicious influence.  The Ambassador noted 
that this is not a complex issue, nor one with any ambiguity: 
democracy is "busting out all over" the Middle East, and the 
Syrians must comply with UNSC Resolution 1559, period.  Under 
Secretary Lyra said the Finns agree, and promised us he would 
 
SIPDIS 
convey this demarche to President Halonen (who, under the 
Finnish constitution, shares authority with the government 
for Finland's foreign policy) and to the Foreign Minister. 
 
¶3. (U) The Ambassador also noted that the government of 
Lebanon must accept international observers to monitor the 
election process, and asked whether the Finns plan to 
contribute any observers.  Lyra said the Finns will offer at 
least a small number of observers.
