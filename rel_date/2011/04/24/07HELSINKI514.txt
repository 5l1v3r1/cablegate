REF: SECSTATE 93173 
 
(SBU) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Hannele 
Voionmaa, Counselor in the Finnish MFA's Unit for Security 
Policy, July 6.  Voionmaa said that the MFA would have to 
consult with the Ministry of Defense before offering a 
definitive response.  She suggested that a determination from 
the Ministry of Defense regarding whether surplus stocks of 
tank and howitzer rounds existed would be unlikely in the 5 
to 10 day timeframe requested, but promised to provide a 
response as soon as possible.
