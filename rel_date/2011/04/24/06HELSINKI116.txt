Laura Kansikas-Debrais, Director of the Finnish MFA's Unit

has not sought to enter Finland or to approach Finnish 
scientists.  She noted that Finland is deeply concerned about 
the volatile situation in Iran and that any approach from 
Iranian officials or scientists will "immediately raise red 
flags" within the array of concerned Finnish government 
agencies and treated with the utmost skepticism.  She thanked 
us for delivering reftel information.
