Â¶1. (C) On November 25 Pol/Econ Chief delivered reftel points 
to Anu Laamanen, MFA Deputy Director General of the Political 
Affairs Unit.  Laamanen was careful to keep the discussion of 
Iran in an EU context, but did say that Finland welcomes the 
consideration of all options within a process that should be 
time-limited.  She added EU ministers discuss Iran regularly 
within the GAERC, and praised Sweden for coordinating 
demarches on Iran's nuclear activities and human rights 
activities during its EU presidency.  Laamanen looked forward 
to future close consultations on engaging Iran.
