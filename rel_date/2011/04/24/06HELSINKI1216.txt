SUBJECT: IRAN'S FLAWED ELECTIONS - FINNISH RESPONSE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 192971 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR WARE FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Middle East 
Office Eija Rotinen Dec. 8.  Rotinen said that US views 
concerning Iran's upcoming elections are "nearly identical" 
to those of the Finnish EU Presidency.  The electoral 
process in Iran is not democratic, Rotinen added, and the 
bodies being elected in December are not representative of 
the Iranian people. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Finland maintains a small, 2-officer Embassy in 
Tehran, and Rotinen agreed to share with us any reporting 
regarding illegitimate election activities.  Regarding 
public statements, Rotinen said there is some debate within 
the EU as to whether or not the Union should even dignify 
this level and type of election with public comments.
