Zitting, Counselor for Burma in the Finnish MFA's Unit for 
Asia.  Zitting welcomed our sharing information on US 
sanctions against the Burmese junta and agreed that the US 
and the EU can intensify the impact of the sanctions on the 
regime if they are coordinated and complement one another. 
She welcomed the US Congress's consideration of new sanctions 
pertaining to gems and timber, along the lines of existing EU 
sanctions.  She also expressed the hope that Congress would 
consider widening those sanctions to precious metals as well.
