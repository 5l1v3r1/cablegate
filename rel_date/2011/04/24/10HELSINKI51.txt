¶1. (C) In a February 4 meeting, DCM presented reftel points 
to MFA Undersecretary for Political Affairs Markus Lyra. 
Lyra responded that "we agree with your views," and that 
Finland believed both talk and pressure would be necessary to 
convince Iran to comply with international norms in its 
nuclear activities.  The most effective way to do so would be 
with new and strengthened UN sanctions, but autonomous EU 
sanctions might be necessary if efforts at the UN failed.  He 
confirmed that his views on EU sanctions were shared by FM 
Stubb. 
 
¶2. (C) Lyra reflected on his ten years of work in dealing 
with Iran off and on, noting that on his last visit to 
Tehran, just before Ahmadinejad's first election, he had 
urged the Iranians to take the path of South Africa rather 
than North Korea.  He noted that he no longer gets 
invitations to visit Tehran, as he used to.  When queried as 
to whether the GOF might go public with its views on the 
nuclear issue if it were asked to do so, Lyra said "no 
problem" without hesitation.  NOTE:  Lyra will leave to take 
up his position as Ambassador to Sweden in a few days.  His 
announced replacement will be Jaakko Laajava, Finland's 
current Ambassador to the UK.
