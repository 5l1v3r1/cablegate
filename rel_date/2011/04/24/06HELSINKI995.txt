HLD DATE AND CO-CHAIR PARTICIPATION 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Ambassador Ware met with Environment 
Minister Enestam on September 27 to discuss the upcoming 
High Level Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy and 
Sustainable Development (HLD), which he confirmed would take 
place on October 24-25.  Enestam also confirmed he will co- 
chair the meeting with Trade and Industry Minister 
Pekkarinen (energy portfolio).  EU Commissioner Dimas will 
likely not attend because he is scheduled to address the EU 
Parliament; DG Environment Carl will likely attend in his 
place. In addition to the HLD, Enestam also briefly raised 
the importance of engaging Russia on environmental issues, 
particularly the Gulf of Finland.  End Summary.

¶2. (U) Ambassador Ware and Enestam agreed that including 
high level energy representatives is helpful in orientating 
future discussion about climate change.  Enestam stated that 
energy and climate change discussions "need to go hand-in- 
hand" if we are to have success together.  Enestam expressed 
that the HLD would be a highlight for the GOF EU Presidency 
and that he was personally eager to work with the U.S. to 
make it a success.  Enestam also said we need to develop 
"transitory solutions" such as carbon capture and clean 
fuels. 
 
¶3. (U) Enestam shared a copy of the tentative annotated 
agenda for the HLD (sent separately), noting that they tried 
to cover all three areas with a balanced approach.  The 
Finns are hoping to see tangible results from the HLD, such 
as formation of a working group to set standards for vehicle 
emissions.  Enestam said they were planning several joint 
press conferences that they expected to be well attended by 
the European media.  Enestam stated the Finns hope to 
produce a joint statement on the facts from the meeting 
(Comment: MFA sources have said they hope to release only 
the agreed-upon agenda. End comment) The Finns also hope to 
announce a date and venue for a follow-up HLD meeting in 
¶2007.

Engaging Russia on Environment 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Enestam commented on the prolonged challenges of 
engaging Russia on environmental issues that have a regional 
impact and that the EU-Russia Summit (November 23-24) would 
hopefully provide a good forum for action.  The EU is hoping 
to discuss with Russia a number of environmental issues such 
as biodiversity, renewable energy, and the possibility of 
pollution in the Gulf of Finland from shipping accidents.
