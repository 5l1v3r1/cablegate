REF: STATE 71071 
 
Classified By: PolChief Greg Thome, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Finnish MFA Deputy 
Middle East Director Sofie Fromm-Emmesberger May 25.  She 
welcomed our points, noting that Syria's upcoming 
"referendum" is not a helpful exercise in the region. 
Finland does not plan to issue any statements prior to the 
vote, Fromm-Emmesberger said, but may do so in the aftermath 
and expects the EU will.
