SUBJECT: FINLAND WON'T JOIN BERN PROCESS DEMARCHE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 132130 
 
Classified By: Polchief Gregory Thome, reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
(C) Emboff presented reftel request for a joint demarche on 
the treatment of the families of Chinese political prisoners 
to MFA Human Rights Unit Director Johanna Suurpaa on August 
Â¶15.  Suurpaa said that the EU had demarched Beijing on the 
treatment of the three families mentioned reftel in the last 
few weeks. On August 11, for instance, a general demarche to 
Beijing on the situation of Uighers also expressed concern 
about the plight of Rebiya Kadeer's family.  As such, Finland 
and presumably other EU members would not be willing to 
approach Beijing again so soon via a joint demarche.  Noting 
that the EU demarches had resulted in a disappointing 
response and no exchange of information, Suurpaa encouraged a 
separate U.S. demarche so that China would receive the same 
message from several sources.  Human rights will come up in a 
general context during the September 10-11 Asia-Europe 
Meeting (ASEM) in Helsinki, and Chinese human rights concerns 
will be discussed in the margins, according to Suurpaa.  A 
fuller exchange will occur on October 23 during the EU-China 
Human Rights Dialogue.
