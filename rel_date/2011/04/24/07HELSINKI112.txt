SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE - CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION 
(CWC) - SEEKING SUPPORT TO BLOCK IRAN BECOMING EXECUTIVE 
COUNCIL CHAIR 
 
REF: SECSTATE 17200 
 
¶1. (U) PolChief delivered subject demarche Feb. 15 to Jani 
Raappana, Counselor for Chemical and Biological Disarmament 
in the MFA's Unit for Arms Control, Disarmament and Non- 
Proliferation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Although Finland has received no "official" word 
that Iran intends to put forward a candidate for the CWC 
chairmanship, Raappana said the GOF opposes Iran's 
occupying that position and shares our concerns.  For now, 
he said, Finland hopes the CWC's Asia Group can sort out 
the matter internally without the involvement of the WEOG, 
and he welcomed US behind-the-scenes efforts to urge the 
Asians put forward a consensus candidate as an alternative 
to the Iranian. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Finland has no official position yet as to what 
actions it would take if the Asia group cannot find 
consensus.  However, Raappana said that the EU countries on 
the CWC would likely seek a unified position.  He added 
that the Europe Group has split in the past on chemical 
weapons issues and suggested that if it cannot reach a 
unified position, Finland would be likely to join the group 
that would vote against Iran's bid.
