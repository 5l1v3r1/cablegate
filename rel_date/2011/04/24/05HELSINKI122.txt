REPORT FOR FINLAND: PART I 
 
REF: 04 STATE 248987 
 
Â¶I.  SUMMARY 
------------- 
 
(U) FINLAND IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT NARCOTICS PRODUCING OR 
TRAFFICKING COUNTRY.  HOWEVER, DRUG USE AND DRUG-RELATED 
CRIME HAVE INCREASED STEADILY OVER THE PAST DECADE.  LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES ARE AFFECTED BY THE FACT THAT 
FINLAND'S CONSTITUTION STRONGLY EMPHASIZES CIVIL LIBERTIES 
AND CONSTRAINS THE STATE FROM USING ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE 
TECHNIQUES SUCH AS WIRETAPPING, ETC., IN ALL BUT THE MOST 
SERIOUS INVESTIGATIONS;  FINLAND'S POLITICAL CULTURE TENDS 
TO FAVOR DEMAND REDUCTION AND REHABILITATION EFFORTS OVER 
STRATEGIES AIMED AT REDUCING SUPPLY.  THE POLICE BELIEVE 
INCREASED DRUG USE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WIDER 
AVAILABILITY OF NARCOTICS IN POST-COLD WAR EUROPE, GREATER 
EXPERIMENTATION BY FINNISH YOUTH, A CULTURAL DE-STIGMATI- 
ZATION OF NARCOTICS USE, AND A GAP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT 
RESOURCES AND THE GROWING INCIDENCE OF DRUG USE.  WHILE 
THERE IS SOME OVERLAND NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING ACROSS THE 
RUSSIAN BORDER, PARTICULARLY IN HEROIN, POLICE BELIEVE 
EXISTING BORDER CONTROLS ARE MOSTLY EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING 
THIS ROUTE FROM BECOMING A MAJOR TRAFFICKING CONDUIT INTO 
FINLAND AND WESTERN EUROPE.  POLICE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT 
SHIPMENTS OF ECSTASY AND OTHER MDMA-TYPE DESIGNER DRUGS 
ARRIVING FROM THE BALTIC COUNTRIES, CHIEFLY ESTONIA. 
POLICE FEAR THAT ESTONIA'S ACCESSION TO THE EU AND SCHENGEN 
ARRANGEMENTS COULD LEAD TO INCREASED TRAFFICKING OF ECSTASY 
FROM TALLINN INTO FINLAND.  FINLAND IS A MAJOR DONOR TO THE 
UNDCP AND IS ACTIVE IN COUNTERNARCOTICS EFFORTS WITHIN THE 
EU.  FINLAND IS A PARTY TO THE 1988 UN DRUG CONVENTION. 
 
 
II.  STATUS OF COUNTRY 
---------------------- 
 
(U) NARCOTICS PRODUCTION, CULTIVATION, AND THE 
PRODUCTION/DIVERSION OF PRECURSOR CHEMICALS IN FINLAND IS 
RELATIVELY MODEST IN SCOPE.  MOST DRUGS THAT ARE CONSUMED IN 
FINLAND ARE PRODUCED ELSEWHERE, AND FINLAND IS NOT A SOURCE 
COUNTRY FOR EXPORT OF NARCOTICS ABROAD.  ESTONIA, RUSSIA, 
SPAIN, AND THE NETHERLANDS ARE FINLAND'S PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF 
ILLICIT DRUGS.  FINNISH LAW MAKES THE DISTRIBUTION, SALE, AND 
TRANSPORT OF NARCOTIC SUBSTANCES ILLEGAL, AND PROVIDES FOR 
EXTRADITION, TRANSIT AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION, 
AND PRECURSOR CHEMICAL CONTROL.  DOMESTIC DRUG ABUSE 
REHABILITATION AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE EXCELLENT.  NEW 
LEGISLATION PASSED IN 2001 ALLOWS THE POLICE TO FINE 
VIOLATORS FOR POSSESSION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF NARCOTICS. 
STATISTICS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE FOR HOW MANY FINES WERE 
LEVIED IN 2004. 
 
(U) THE OVERALL INCIDENCE OF DRUG USE IN FINLAND REMAINS LOW 
BUT IS INCREASING. COCAINE USE IS RARE, AND FINLAND HAS ONE OF 
EUROPE'S LOWEST CANNIBIS-USE RATES, BUT AMPHETAMINES, 
METHAMPHETAMINE, OTHER SYNTHETIC DRUGS, AND HEROIN USE ARE 
INCREASINGLY POPULAR.  THE USE OF ECSTASY AND OTHER MDMA-TYPE 
DESIGNER DRUGS HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS, AND 
POLICE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE ARRIVAL OF GAMMA-HYDRO- 
XYBUTYRATE (GHB) IN FINLAND.  AS IN MANY OTHER WESTERN 
COUNTRIES, ECSTASY AND GHB USE IN FINLAND TENDS TO BE 
CONCENTRATED AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE AND ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
"CLUB-CULTURE" IN HELSINKI AND OTHER LARGER CITIES.  SOCIAL 
SERVICE AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE INTRODUCTION OF GHB AND OTHER 
"DATE RAPE" DRUGS INTO FINLAND HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE 
NUMBER OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS REPORTED BY YOUNG WOMEN.  FINNISH LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES ADMIT THAT LACK OF RESOURCES AND LEGAL 
RESTRICTIONS ON ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE AND UNDERCOVER POLICE 
WORK MAKE PENETRATING THE ECSTASY TRADE DIFFICULT.  CHANGING 
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ATTITUDES TOWARD DRUG USE AND EXPERIMEN- 
TATION ALSO CONTRIBUTE THIS PHENOMENON. 
 
(U) HEROIN USE IS ON THE RISE IN FINLAND.  POLICE REPORTED A 
SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE PURITY OF HEROIN IMPORTED TO FINLAND 
SUBSEQUENT TO THE CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN IN 2001.  A NUMBER 
OF SEIZURES MADE PRIOR TO LATE 2001 HAD A PURITY AS HIGH AS 
75%.  MORE RECENT SEIZURES HAVE INDICATED A PURITY AS LOW AS 
5%, AND OVERDOSE-RELATED DEATHS HAVE DECLINED FOR SEVERAL 
YEARS.  BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING HIGH-GRADE 
HEROIN, SOME USERS ARE TURNING TO SUBUTEX (BUPRENORPHINE), 
WHICH THEY OBTAIN PRIMARILY FROM FRANCE.  ACCORDING TO THE 
POLICE, FRENCH DOCTORS CAN PRESCRIBE UP TO THREE WEEKS SUPPLY 
OF SUBUTEX.  FINNISH COURIERS TRAVEL FREQUENTLY TO FRANCE TO 
OBTAIN THEIR SUPPLY WHICH IS THEN RESOLD IN FINLAND WITH A 
HIGH MARK-UP.  POSSESSION OF SUBUTEX IS LEGAL IN FINLAND WITH 
A DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION.  THE INCIDENCE OF NEW HIV CASES 
RELATED TO IV DRUG USE IN FINLAND HELD STEADY IN 2004. 
ACCORDING TO FINNISH POLICE, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO 
DOZEN ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS OPERATING IN FINLAND, MANY OF 
WHICH HAVE CONNECTIONS WITH ORGANIZED CRIME SYNDICATES IN THE 
BALTICS AND RUSSIA.  SOME OF THESE GROUPS ARE FACILITATORS 
AND DISTRIBUTORS OF NARCOTICS TO THE FINNISH MARKET.  POLICE 
ARE CONCERNED THAT AS ESTONIA AND THE BALTIC COUNTRIES ENTER 
INTO THE EU'S SCHENGEN AGREEMENT, WHICH ALLOWS THE FREE 
MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE EU, FINLAND COULD 
INCREASINGLY BECOME BOTH A TRANSIT COUNTRY FOR TRAFFICKERS 
AND A MORE ATTRACTIVE MARKET.  CRIME SYNDICATES ARE ALREADY 
USING FINLAND AS A TRANSIT COUNTRY INTO THE SCHENGEN REGION 
FOR TRAFFICKING-IN-PERSONS. 
 
(U) SMUGGLING ROUTES:  POLICE REPORT THAT ESTONIANS RUN MOST 
OF THE ILLICIT DRUG SMUGGLING TRADE FOR FINLAND, ALTHOUGH THE 
DOMESTIC STREET-LEVEL DEALERS ARE CHIEFLY FINNS.  IN THE 
PAST, THE ESTONIAN RINGS PRIMARILY SMUGGLED DUTCH OR BELGIAN 
MADE ECSTASY.  BEGINNING IN 2003, THE SYNDICATES ALSO BEGAN 
SMUGGLING GREATER QUANTITIES OF ESTONIAN-PRODUCED ECSTASY, 
ALTHOUGH THE QUALITY AND MARKET VALUE IS LOWER.  MOST ECSTASY 
IN FINLAND TODAY IS NOW BELIEVED TO ORIGINATE IN ESTONIA. 
ESTONIAN CRIME SYNDICATES ALSO ORGANIZE THE SHIPMENT OF 
MOROCCAN CANNABIS FROM SPAIN TO FINLAND.  RUSSIAN SYNDICATES 
IN ST. PETERSBURG HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY SUPPLIERS OF HEROIN 
FOR THE FINNISH MARKET, BUT ESTONIAN TRAFFICKERS ARE NOW 
ACTIVE IN THIS AREA AS WELL. 
 
 
III.  COUNTRY ACTIONS AGAINST DRUGS IN 2004 
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
(U) POLICY INITIATIVES:  THE FINNISH GOVERNMENT RELEASED A 
COMPREHENSIVE POLICY STATEMENT ON ILLEGAL DRUGS IN 1998 WHICH 
CLEARLY ARTICULATED A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY FOR ILLICIT 
NARCOTICS.  THE STATEMENT WARNED CITIZENS THAT ALL NARCOTICS 
INFRACTION, FROM CASUAL USE TO MANUFACTURING AND TRAFFICKING, 
ARE CRIMES PUNISHABLE UNDER FINNISH LAW.  HOWEVER, A NEW LAW 
TOOK EFFECT IN 2001 IMPLEMENTING A SYSTEM OF FINES FOR 
POSSESSION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF DRUGS RATHER THAN JAIL TIME. 
THIS LAW ENJOYS WIDESPREAD POPULAR SUPPORT, AND IS CHIEFLY 
USED TO PUNISH YOUTH FOUND IN POSSESSION OF SMALL QUANTITIES 
OF MARIJUANA, HASHISH, OR ECSTASY.  FINNISH LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AUTHORITIES HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE MIXED MESSAGE THE 
2001 LEGISLATION ENTAILS AND WOULD PREFER TO SEND A STRONGER 
DETERRENT MESSAGE ON THE DEMAND SIDE.  THERE DOES NOT APPEAR 
TO BE SUFFICIENT POLITICAL SUPPORT AT THIS TIME FOR A POLICY 
AIMED AT CURBING DEMAND THROUGH STRONGER PUNITIVE MEASURES, 
HOWEVER. A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT IN 2004 WAS INVOLVED IN A 
TABLOID SCANDAL WHEN SHE ADMITTED HAVING SMOKED HASHISH AT A 
PARTY AS A SITTING MP;  THERE WERE NO CHARGES FILED IN THE 
CASE. 
 
(U) ACCOMPLISHMENTS:  IN LATE 2000, PARLIAMENT PASSED 
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD INCREASE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
COMMUNITY'S ABILITY TO PURSUE CRIMINALS WITH ADDITIONAL 
INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS, INCLUDING UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATIONS 
AND WIRETAPS.  ALTHOUGH THE LEGISLATION WENT INTO EFFECT 
IN 2001, A NUMBER OF RESTRICTIONS ON USING SUCH TECHNIQUES 
REMAIN AND THEY ARE NOT REGULARLY EMPLOYED.  THE FINNISH 
GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY DURING 2004 FOCUSED ON REGIONAL AND 
MULTILATERAL COOPERATION AIMED AT STEMMING THE FLOW OF 
DRUGS BEFORE THEY REACH FINLAND'S BORDERS AND ON BEEFED-UP 
BORDER CONTROL MEASURES DESIGNED TO DISCOURAGE TRAFFICKERS. 
IN 2004 FINNISH OFFICIALS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL 
MULTILATERAL CONFERENCES AND TRAINING SEMINARS AIMED AT 
COMBATING NARCOTICS.  IN PARTICULAR, FINLAND PLAYED A MAJOR 
ROLE IN THE OSCE'S DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY. 
 
(U) LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS: ALTHOUGH FINAL 2004 FIGURES ARE 
NOT YET AVAILABLE, THE POLICE BELIEVE THAT ARRESTS AND 
SEIZURES ARE PROJECTED TO HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE. 
BEGINNING IN THE MID-1980S, LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES 
FOCUSED LIMITED POLICE RESOURCES ON MAJOR NARCOTICS CASES 
AND SIGNIFICANT TRAFFICKERS, SOMEWHAT TO THE DETRIMENT OF 
STREET-LEVEL PATROLS, INVESTIGATIONS, AND PROSECUTION. 
POLICE SUGGEST THE RESULT OF THIS FOCUS WAS TO 
REDUCE DRUG USERS' FEAR OF ARREST AND TO MAKE RECREATIONAL 
DRUG USE MORE WIDESPREAD.  ACCORDING TO POLICE, THE RISE IN 
DRUG USE DURING THE PAST DECADE LED TO A SITUATION IN WHICH 
THE NUMBER OF DRUG OFFENDERS EXCEEDS THE RESOURCES DEPLOYED 
TO COMBAT ILLEGAL DRUGS.  THE POLICE REPORT THAT FOLLOWING 
THE RELEASE OF THE 1998 GOVERNMENT POLICY STATEMENT ON DRUGS, 
GREATER RESOURCES HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO INVESTIGATIONS AT THE 
STREET-LEVEL.  THIS INCLUDES ACTION BY UNIFORMED PATROLS AS 
WELL AS PLAINCLOTHES POLICE OFFICERS. 
 
(U) CORRUPTION:  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ARRESTS OR PROSECUTIONS OF 
PUBLIC OFFICIALS CHARGED WITH CORRUPTION OR RELATED OFFENSES 
LINKED TO NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING IN FINNISH HISTORY. 
 
 
(U) AGREEMENTS AND TREATIES:  FINLAND IS A PARTY TO THE 1988 
UN DRUG CONVENTION AND ITS LEGISLATION IS CONSISTENT WITH ALL 
THE CONVENTION'S GOALS.  FINNISH JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES ARE 
EMPOWERED TO SEIZE THE ASSETS, REAL AND FINANCIAL, OF 
CRIMINALS.  FINLAND IS ALSO A PARTY TO THE 1961 UN SINGLE 
CONVENTION ON NARCOTIC DRUGS, THE 1972 PROTOCOL AMENDING THE 
SINGLE CONVENTION, AND THE 1971 CONVENTION ON PSYCHOTROPIC 
SUBSTANCES.  FINLAND HAS EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH MANY 
COUNTRIES, AND RATIFIED THE EU EXTRADITION TREATY IN 1999. 
FINLAND IS CURRENTLY PREPARING TO IMPLEMENT THE EU ARREST 
WARRANT.  FINLAND IS A SIGNATORY TO THE UN CONVENTION AGAINST 
TRANSNATIONAL CRIME, THE PROTOCOL TO PREVENT, SUPPRESS AND 
PUNISH TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS, AND THE PROTOCOL AGAINST THE 
SMUGGLING OF MIGRANTS.  A 1976 BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY 
IS IN FORCE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND FINLAND, ALTHOUGH 
FINLAND WILL ONLY EXTRADITE NON-FINNISH CITIZENS TO THE 
UNITED STATES.  FINLAND IN 2004 SIGNED THE BILATERAL 
INSTRUMENT OF THE EU-U.S. EXTRADITION TREATY. 
 
(U) THE UNITED STATES HAS ALSO CONCLUDED A CUSTOMS MUTUAL 
ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT WITH FINLAND.  FINLAND IS A MEMBER OF 
THE MAJOR DONORS' GROUP WITHIN THE DUBLIN GROUP. THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF ITS FINANCIAL AND OTHER ASSISTANCE TO 
DRUG PRODUCING AND TRANSIT COUNTRIES HAS BEEN VIA THE UNDCP. 
FINLAND CONCLUDED BILATERAL NARCOTICS AGREEMENTS WITH ESTONIA 
SHORTLY AFTER THAT COUNTRY GAINED INDEPENDENCE.  MULTILATERAL 
TREATIES, INCLUDING MEMBERSHIP IN THE UNDCP, CONSTITUTE THE 
BASIS OF FINNISH COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES ON 
COUNTERNARCOTICS INITIATIVES. 
 
(U) FINLAND MAKES AN IMPRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO COMBAT 
DRUG TRAFFICKING AND OTHER ORGANIZED CRIME.  THE FINNISH 
POLICE MAINTAIN LIAISON OFFICERS IN TEN EUROPEAN CITIES (SIX 
IN RUSSIA, FOUR ELSEWHERE).  THE PROSECUTOR-GENERAL'S OFFICE 
MAINTAINS LIAISON OFFICERS IN ST. PETERSBURG, TALLINN, AND 
MOSCOW. IN ADDITION, FINLAND AND THE OTHER NORDIC COUNTRIES 
POOL THEIR RESOURCES AND SHARE INFORMATION GATHERED BY NORDIC 
LIAISON OFFICERS STATIONED IN 34 POSTS AROUND THE WORLD. 
FINLAND PARTICIPATES MULTILATERALLY IN REGIONAL EFFORTS 
CHIEFLY THROUGH THE EU AND THE COUNCIL OF BALTIC SEA STATES/ 
ORGANIZED CRIME TASK FORCE. 
 
 
(U) CULTIVATION/PRODUCTION:  THERE WERE NO SEIZURES OF 
INDIGENOUSLY CULTIVATED OPIATES, NO RECORDED DIVERSIONS OF 
PRECURSOR CHEMICALS, AND NO DETECTION OF ILLICIT 
METHAMPHETAMINE, COCAINE, OR LSD LABORATORIES IN FINLAND IN 
Â¶2003.  FINLAND'S CLIMATE MAKES NATURAL CULTIVATION OF 
CANNABIS AND OPIATES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.  LOCAL CANNABIS 
CULTIVATION IS LIMITED TO SMALL NUMBERS OF PLANTS IN 
INDIVIDUAL HOMES USING ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING CHIEFLY FOR 
PERSONAL USE.  THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE 22 KEY PRECURSOR 
CHEMICALS USED FOR COCAINE, AMPHETAMINE, AND HEROIN 
PRODUCTION IS TIGHTLY CONTROLLED. 
 
(U) DRUG FLOW/TRANSIT:  HASHISH IS THE DRUG MOST OFTEN SEIZED 
BY THE FINNISH POLICE.  TRAFFICKING IN HIGHLY PURIFIED 
METHAMPHETAMINE FROM ESTONIA AND POLAND, ECSTASY FROM 
ESTONIA, AND AMPHETAMINES FROM LITHUANIA ARE A CONTINUING 
CONCERN FOR FINLAND.  FINNISH AUTHORITIES REPORT THAT THEIR 
LAND BORDER WITH RUSSIA IS WELL-GUARDED ON BOTH SIDES TO 
ENSURE THAT THE BORDER WILL NOT BECOME A SIGNIFICANT 
NARCOTICS TRANSIT ROUTE. 
 
(U) DOMESTIC PROGRAMS (DEMAND REDUCTION):  THE FINNISH 
GOVERNMENT TAKES THE APPROACH THAT DEMAND REDUCTION IS BEST 
ACHIEVED BY IMPLEMENTING AN EFFECTIVE NORDIC WELFARE POLICY 
WHICH CALLS FOR EARLY AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION BEFORE DRUG 
USE BECOMES A PROBLEM.  THOUGH THE NORDIC WELFARE MODEL TENDS 
TOWARD CENTRALIZATION, THE FINNISH GOVERNMENT GIVES SUBSTANTIAL 
AUTONOMY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADDRESS DEMAND REDUCTION 
USING FEDERAL MONEY.  FINNISH SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO EDUCATE 
CHILDREN ABOUT THE DANGERS OF DRUGS.  PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES 
OFFER REHABILITATION SERVICES TO USERS AND ADDICTS.  SUCH 
PROGRAMS TYPICALLY USE A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT EMPHASIZES 
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC REINTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY AND IS NOT 
SOLELY FOCUSED ON ELIMINATING THE SUBJECT'S USE AND ABUSE OF 
DRUGS.  REPLACEMENT AND MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR HEROIN 
ADDICTS USING BUPRENORPHINE IS RELATIVELY NEW IN FINLAND AND 
NOT YET WIDESPREAD. 
 
 
IV.  U.S. POLICY INITIATIVES 
---------------------------- 
 
 
(U) THE UNITED STATES HAS PURSUED COOPERATION WITH FINLAND IN 
A REGIONAL CONTEXT, COORDINATING ASSISTANCE WITH FINLAND AND 
THE OTHER NORDICS WITH ASSISTANCE TO THE BALTIC SEA STATES. 
IN JANUARY 2000, THE DEA CONDUCTED A TWO-WEEK REGIONAL DRUG 
ENFORCEMENT SEMINAR IN HELSINKI.  THE SEMINAR BROUGHT 
TOGETHER PARTICIPANTS FROM FINLAND, ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND 
LITHUANIA. 
 
(U) BILATERAL COOPERATION:  COOPERATION BETWEEN U.S. LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THEIR FINNISH COUNTERPARTS ON 
NARCOTICS IS 
EXCELLENT. 
 
(U) THE ROAD AHEAD:  THE UNITED STATES ANTICIPATES CONTINUED 
EXCELLENT COOPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF FINLAND IN ALL 
AREAS OF COUNTERING CRIME AND NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING.  THE 
ONLY LIMITATIONS TO SUCH COOPERATION WILL LIKELY BE 
LIMITATIONS DICTATED BY THE SMALL RESOURCE BASE THAT FINNISH 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL. 
 
 
Â¶V.  STATISTICAL TABLES 
----------------------- 
 
 
(U) 2004 STATISTICS FOR NARCOTICS SEIZURES AND ARRESTS WERE 
NOT YET AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THIS REPORT WAS SUBMITTED. 
SEPTEL INCLUDING 2004 STATISTICS WILL FOLLOW.
