Â¶1. (SBU) Finnish Foreign Minister Ilkka Kanerva will attend 
the donors conference in Paris on December 17th according to 
Anna Savolainen in the Foreign Ministry's Middle East Unit. 
Savolainen said Finland's final contribution, in the form of 
bilateral aid and in-kind contributions, is still being 
discussed; however, it will likely be in the neighborhood of 
10 million Euros this year.  Savolainen stressed Finland is 
committed to supporting the peace process in the Middle East 
by providing on-going financial support for the Palestinian 
Authority.
