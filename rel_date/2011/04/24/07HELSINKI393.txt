SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE: IMPLEMENTING UNSCR 1747: 
ADVOCATING A BROAD DEFINITION OF "ARMS AND RELATED MATERIEL" 
 
REF: STATE 67462 
 
¶1. PolChief delivered subject demarche to Tarja Pesamaa, 
Deputy Director of the Finnish MFA's Unit for Arms Control, 
Disarmament and Non-Proliferation.  Pesamaa said that the GOF 
agrees with the US that broad interpretation and consistent 
standards of implementation are crucial for UNSCR 1747 to be 
effective.  She drew attention to the EU Council's resolution 
on implementation which, among other things, prevents sales 
of all goods on the NSG and MCTR lists.  Finland supports 
this resolution and the strong standards it sets for all EU 
members, Pesamaa said. 
 
¶2. She also explained that Finland has had no 1737 reports to 
submit, in part because of the GOF's active to Finnish 
companies warning that they approach any transaction with 
Iran with the utmost caution.
