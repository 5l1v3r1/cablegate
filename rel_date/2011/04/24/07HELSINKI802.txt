Classified By: POLCHIEF GREG THOME FOR REASONS: 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
(C) PolChief delivered subject demarche to Rauli Suikkanen, 
Deputy Director of the Finnish MFA,s Office of Asia and 
Oceania, Oct. 29.  Suikkanen agreed that now is a good time 
for the international community to condemn the Junta,s 
recent behavior and press for genuine dialogue on democracy 
and reform.  He noted that during its EU Presidency, Finland 
used Burmese attendance at the EU-ASEAN Summit in Helsinki to 
address the crisis and the dismal human rights situation in 
Burma.  (NOTE: By pre-arrangement with ASEAN, Burma attended 
that 2006 head-of-state level event at the Deputy Minister 
level.)  The GOF has not yet determined whether it will 
attend the EU-ASEAN Commemorative Ministerial in Singapore at 
the Foreign Minister level, but if it does it will support 
using that event to condemn the Junta,s recent behavior and 
press for greater democracy and respect for human rights, 
just as it did during the Summit in Helsinki, Suikkanen added.
