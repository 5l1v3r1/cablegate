SUBJECT: FINNISH RESPONSE - APPROACHING THE EU IN ADVANCE 
OF THE JANUARY 28- 29 FOREIGN MINISTERS MEETING (GAERC) 
 
REF: SECSTATE 7679 
 
(SBU) PolChief delivered the Department's GAERC talking 
points to Finnish MFA Deputy EU Correspondent Markku Lampinen 
on January 24.  Two highlights: 
 
WESTERN BALKANS:  Lampinen noted that ministers are unlikely 
to approve sweeping conclusions on Kosovo prior to the 
Serbian elections.  However, Kosovo remains among the most 
important of Finland's foreign policy priorities, and 
Lampinen said the GOF supports the Slovenian Presidency's 
suggestion that an extraordinary GAERC be held immediately 
after those elections to do a "thorough examination" of the 
EU's next steps.  On the question of a Kosovar declaration of 
independence, the GOF fully shares our view that it is 
crucial that a significant number of EU countries join the EU 
in recognizing the Pristina government.  Finland will "be 
among the first wave" to do so, he emphasized.  Lampinen also 
reminded us that Finland intends to increase its KFOR 
presence from about 400 troops to more than 460 this spring 
and resume a "framework nation" role.  The GOF also plans 
robust participation in the EU civilian/police missions. 
 
MIDDLE EAST:  Lampinen said the EU was leaning toward 
conclusions that would "gently urge" Israel to loosen the 
border and trade restrictions it has imposed on Gaza, 
particularly noting the need to allow delivery of fuel and 
humanitarian supplies.  He also reassured us that the 
conclusions would contain language condemning the Hamas 
rocket attacks on Israeli civilians.
