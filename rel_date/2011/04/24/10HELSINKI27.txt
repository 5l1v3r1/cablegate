REF: SECSTATE 131637 
 
¶1. (SBU) Pol/Econoff spoke with Ingmar Strom, Counsellor in 
the MFA's Unit for Latin America and the Caribbean affairs, 
regarding reftel talking points.  Strom noted that the GOF 
prefers to engage Cuba through a common EU position but that 
this has been made more difficult by a few EU members which 
are willing to engage Cuba outside of the common position. 
While preferring not to list those few other member states, 
he noted that Spain is a special case because of historic 
ties to Cuba and Spain's individual engagement should not be 
viewed as weakening the common position.  Though recognizing 
Spain's special circumstances, Strom went on to state that 
the GOF would prefer Spain to engage Cuba through a common EU 
agreement. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The GOF recognizes that Cuba is attempting to 
undermine the EU's common position by establishing bilateral 
relations with EU countries which regularly engage with Cuba. 
 The GOF is aware of Cuba's interest in securing agreements 
with particular EU members that would limit communication 
with Cuban civil rights groups.  While Strom is concerned of 
a weaking of the EU common position he believes that the EU 
can engage Cuba on the full range of issues including 
improvements in the human rights conditions. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Per reftel, Pol/Econoff also asked about areas that 
USG and GOF could better cooperate in regarding Cuba.  Strom 
answered that he did not see any areas in which the USG and 
GOF could more closely cooperate at this time.
