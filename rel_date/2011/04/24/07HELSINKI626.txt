SUBJECT: END OF IRAQI TRAINING MISSION AT JIPTC 
 
REF: SECSTATE 112485 
 
(U) PolChief informed Anu Laamanen-Ryter, Office Director 
of the Finnish MFA's Civilian Crisis Management (CCM) Unit, 
that the Iraqi Training mission at JIPTC would end August 
22, and thanked her for Finland's participation over the 
years.  At its peak, Finland had 10 police trainers at the 
JIPTC, a significant contribution for a small nation with 
many other CCM obligations worldwide.  That commitment was 
reduced steadily over the course of 2007 to its current 
level of 2 trainers, but the GOF had consistently indicated 
that it would be willing send more trainers if funding 
became available.  Laamanen-Ryter called the closing of the 
JIPTC "a pity," but reiterated her view that Finland's 
police trainers had had an outstanding experience with the 
mission.
