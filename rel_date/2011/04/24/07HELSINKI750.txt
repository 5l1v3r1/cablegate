EFFORTS TO CONFRONT CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
REF: HELSINKI 00131 
 
¶1. (U) Using California as a model for initiatives at the 
state level, former Executive Director of the California Air 
Resources Board, Catherine Witherspoon, presented U.S. 
strategies for combating climate change to a wide cross 
section of Finnish society, including government officials, 
academics, journalists, business contacts and interested 
citizens.  During a two and a half day visit to Helsinki 
September 10-12, Witherspoon offered significant insights 
into the environmental policy creation process in the U.S. 
and the importance of technology in countering climate 
change.  Witherspoon effectively engaged leading Finnish 
politicians and business leaders in discussions about efforts 
to develop aggressive climate policies and fund technological 
breakthroughs in the U.S.  Audiences asked Witherspoon fair, 
though often direct, questions about U.S. efforts and the 
future of U.S. climate policy.  Witherspoon's approach, which 
was upbeat, yet realistic, resonated with Finnish audiences. 
Additionally, her visit assisted Embassy efforts to reach out 
to contacts from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who 
felt excluded from the High Level Dialogue last year. 
 
¶2. (U) Witherspoon met numerous officials from Finnish 
Government Ministries, including Minister of the Environment 
Paula Lehtomaki, members of Parliament, business leaders, and 
representatives from NGOs.  Speaking to an audience of over 
200 people, Witherspoon addressed the topic of "the 
challenges of climate change strategies in California" during 
a Climate Change Seminar sponsored by Embassy Helsinki, NGO 
Environment Leaders' Union and Haaga-Helia University of 
Applied Sciences.  Witherspoon also gave presentations at two 
key think tanks: the Finnish Institute of International 
Affairs (UPI) and the Finnish Business and Policy Forum 
(EVA).  She was also interviewed by numerous media outlets. 
With over two decades of experience in air quality management 
and climate issues, Witherspoon is closely connected to 
California,s innovative role in driving regional and 
national environmental and climate change policy. 
 
¶3. (U) Building upon the success of the U.S.-EU High Level 
Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable 
Development (HLD) in Helsinki last October, Embassy Helsinki 
has held numerous activities to raise the profile of positive 
U.S. actions to address climate change.  This momentum 
provided the foundation for Witherspoon's successful visit to 
Helsinki.
