Classified By: POLCHIEF GREGORY THOME FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (U) PolChief delivered December GAERC demarche to 
Finnish EU Correspondent Jarno Syrjala November 5 and 
followed up further by phone November 7.  Syrjala 
highlighted the following points: 
 
¶2. (C) TURKEY/ENLARGEMENT: The Finnish Presidency is 
greatly encouraged by Turkey's announcement that it 
intends to open one airport and one port to Cypriot 
traffic.  Syrjala confirmed that Turkey has informed the 
Presidency of this decision, adding that it can only have 
a "positive impact" on a GAERC ministerial that will 
focus heavily on enlargement questions in general and 
Turkey in particular.  Many EU member states (MS) had 
indicated to the GOF that they did not want discussion of 
Turkey to "hijack" the meetings.  In fact, Syrjala 
acknowledged, many MS have been speaking more openly in 
favor of freezing or even suspending new Acquis chapters 
for Turkey, and that their positions appear to be 
hardening.  However, in light of new developments the 
Finnish Presidency will seek to allow "as much time as 
necessary" for discussion of Turkey's progress.  Syrjala 
noted that the Finnish Presidency agrees with most US 
views on Turkey and re-emphasized the efforts Finland 
continues to make to keep Turkey's accession process on 
track. 
 
¶3. (C) MEPP/LEBANON: Syrjala said that these discussions 
will take up the bulk of the "external relations" 
discussions at the GAERC.  The EU shares the US concerns 
about Lebanon and about Hezbollah's disruptive behavior, 
and agrees that bolstering the Siniora Government is 
crucial.  Regarding the MEPP, Syrjala reiterated that for 
the most part the "Spanish-French" proposal offers little 
new and will not significantly affect the EU's overall 
policies. 
 
¶4. (C) KOSOVO/WESTERN BALKANS:  On Kosovo, Syrjala re- 
emphasized that the GOF's national priority as well as 
that of the Finnish Presidency remain to keep the EU 
united behind UN Special Rep Martti Ahtisaari's efforts 
to implement a final status decision shortly after 
Serbia's January 21 elections.  On Serbia, Syrjala said 
the EU Presidency appreciated our demarche point 
indicating that Belgrade needs to do more on ICTY 
cooperation.  The Finnish national position has been one 
of the toughest in the EU on this point, he added; 
however, NATO's decision to offer PfP to Serbia will make 
it harder to ensure a strongly unified EU position. 
 
¶5. (C) IRAN: Syrjala said that there would be a very 
short update from the EU Security Council members on the 
status of sanctions negotiations at the UN.  Most MS 
believe that a broader discussion of Iran is needed, he 
added, but because of time constraints that discussion 
will likely be put off until the first GAERC of the 
German Presidency.
