LEGISLATION 
 
REF: BOGOTA 3894 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons: 1.4 B & D. 
 
(C) On April 21, the House of Representatives voted to 
maintain status quo on extradition procedures in the context 
of reforms to the criminal procedure code (reftel).  The GOC, 
supported strongly by the Embassy, won the day.  To hold the 
line on extradition, Prosecutor General (Fiscal General) Luis 
Camilo Osorio and Viceminister of Justice Mario Iguaran 
maintained a constant presence in the House during the 
debate.  The measure now goes to the Senate, where ranking 
members tell us that extradition procedures should also 
remain intact.
