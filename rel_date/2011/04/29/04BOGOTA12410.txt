TAGS: PTER KJUS PHUM PINR PREL CO
SUBJECT: GOC PARDONS 23 FARC GUERRILLAS 
 
REF: BOGOTA 11207 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood for reasons 
1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (U) On December 2, the GOC pardoned 23 imprisoned members 
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  Those 
pardoned were guilty only of membership in an illegal armed 
group; no guerrillas guilty of violent crimes were eligible 
for pardon.  They will be released from prisons throughout 
the country on December 3 and have pledged not to return to 
the armed conflict.  They will be eligible to enter the GOC's 
reinsertion program for former members of an illegal armed 
group.  All had light sentences and would have been released 
in a short period of time even without the pardon. 
 
¶2. (U) The GOC promised the safety of the pardoned guerrillas 
and their families from FARC or paramilitary reprisals, and 
said the release was a demonstration of government commitment 
to secure the release of hostages.  Peace Commissioner Luis 
Carlos Restrepo said efforts would continue to hold a 
humanitarian exchange with FARC and President Uribe 
underscored that the release was not a surrender to FARC 
demands.  Family members of FARC hostages, including Ingrid 
Betancourt's mother and the wife of one of the kidnapped 
Valle Department deputies, praised the GOC's actions. 
 
¶3. (C) Restrepo explained to the Ambassador that the GOC was 
responding to heavy pressure from family members of FARC 
hostages to hold a prisoner exchange.  The FARC has rejected 
all GOC offers, including a recent proposal to swap 15 
guerrillas followed by a temporary cease-fire and 
face-to-face meeting in Bogota (reftel).  We understand that 
another 12 ex-FARC members will be released as soon as the 
documents are prepared. 
 
¶4. (C) Comment: Although we are dubious that this initiative 
will prompt any FARC action, it has some interesting aspects: 
(1) It is very close to the outcome desired for the 
paramilitary process: release and reinsertion of illegal 
armed group members after identification, investigation, and 
verification that they have not committed violent crimes that 
would demand incarceration; (2) It has received a positive 
reaction inside and outside Colombia, putting the ball 
squarely in the FARC's court; and (3) It has reduced pressure 
for concessions on cases like Simon Trinidad and other high 
profile FARC members held by the government.
