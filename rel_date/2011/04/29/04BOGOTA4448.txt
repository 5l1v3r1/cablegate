Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) On April 29, U/S Grossman and SOUTHCOM Commander met 
President Uribe, Minister of Defense Uribe, and the acting 
Foreign Minister.  Ambassador also attended.  U/S Grossman 
underscored continuing U.S. support for consolidation of Plan 
Colombia and for Plan Patriota.  He expressed support for 
Uribe's April 27 declaration on peace talks with the 
paramilitaries.  He said that the GOC human rights record 
would remain under scrutiny and needs to improve.  Grossman 
emphasized the importance of cooperation between the army and 
police and a zero tolerance policy for collusion between 
paramilitary groups and the armed forces.  Uribe asserted 
that U.S. support was crucial for his democratic security 
policy.  He noted that his April 27 communique expressed his 
position on peace talks (reftel) and pledged that any members 
of the security forces guilty of collusion with 
paramilitaries would immediately be dismissed.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) U/S Grossman made three main points: 
 
-- The USG is committed to supporting Uribe's security 
policies, particularly Plan Patriota, and consolidating Plan 
Colombia.  Grossman said we were consulting with the U.S. 
Congress on raising the cap on U.S. Plan Colombia personnel. 
He said that inter-service cooperation, especially between 
the police and military, is key to Plan Patriota's success. 
 
-- Grossman praised the President's April 27 statement 
denouncing paramilitary threats against him, stating that 
extradition is non-negotiable, and warning that any illegal 
armed group interested in negotiating must obey the GOC's 
conditions, including a cease-fire, or else be pursued 
militarily (reftel).  He inquired how Uribe viewed the impact 
of paramilitary commander Carlos Castano's disappearance. 
 
-- Grossman noted that the GOC's human rights record was 
improving and that kidnapping, violence, and internal 
displacements were decreasing.  But much more needed to be 
done.  He cautioned Uribe that the GOC and the USG would have 
to respond to reports of collusion between the armed forces 
and paramilitary groups (which must be ended forever) and of 
corruption within the Prosecutor General's Office (Fiscalia). 
 The GOC must be committed to discovering, investigating, 
prosecuting, and punishing the guilty parties. 
 
¶3. (C) Uribe responded: 
 
-- Plan Patriota's objectives are to capture top commanders 
of the illegal armed groups, cut off supply and trafficking 
routes, and regain territory.  Ultimately, the GOC is seeking 
to end all drug trafficking and terrorism.  Uribe noted that 
U.S. support was crucial. 
 
-- Regarding the peace process, Uribe said that he had 
clearly stated his position on negotiations with illegal 
armed groups.  He said that while negotiations were 
important, he was not willing to give up his country's 
dignity to pursue them.  Uribe thanked Grossman for his 
support for the statement. 
 
-- Uribe and MOD Uribe agreed that they will "fire" any 
members of the security forces guilty of colluding with the 
paramilitaries.  They noted, however, that some false 
accusations of collusion were politically motivated.  The 
security forces continually confront the paramilitaries. 
According to the GOC, since President Uribe took office, 
5,047 paramilitaries have been captured and 613 killed. 
Between 2002 and 2003, there has been a 33 percent increase 
in paramilitary captu
