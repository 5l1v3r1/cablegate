SUBJECT: NO END IN SIGHT TO URIBE-SUPREME COURT POWER 
STRUGGLE 

Classified By: Political Counselor John Creamer 
Reasons 1.4 (b and d) 

SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (C) President Uribe used a statement by Senator Nancy 
Patricia Gutierrez accusing Auxiliary Supreme Court 
Magistrate Ivan Velasquez of irregularities in his 
para-political investigations, to slam the Supreme Court for 
"judicialclientalism" and nepotism.  Uribe urged Congress to 
proceed with judicial reform, and told members of Congress 
they could not remain "cowards" in the face of court 
investigations.  The Court backed Velasquez against Uribe's 
charges, and asked the Prosecutor General's Office (Fiscalia) 
to investigate the allegations.  Uribe's Communications 
Director Jorge Eastman told us Uribe-Supreme Court relations 
had reached a "point of no return."  Police Director Oscar 
Naranjo privately agreed some magistrates are motivated by 
political bias, but noted that key Uribe advisors 
orchestrated at least two efforts to discredit the court. 
End summary. 

URIBE CONTINUES OFFENSIVE AGAINST COURTS 
---------------------------------------- 
¶2. (U) President Alvaro Uribe continued his offensive against 
the Supreme Court the week of August 11, suggesting  that 
some court officials sought bribes in the para-political 
investigations and accusing the high courts of "judicial 
clientalism."   Uribe highlighted accusations of political 
bias by former Senate President Nancy Patricia Gutierrez. 
Gutierrez legally taped a court investigator assigned to 
Auxiliary Supreme Court Magistrate Ivan 
Velasquez--responsible for many para-political cases--who 
questioned whether Velasquez had acted legally in his 
investigations and intimated that the investigations were 
politically driven.  Uribe also cited allegations by former 
Senator Ruben Quintero--his private secretary during Uribe's 
tenure as Governor of Antioquia--that some magistrates have 
sought bribes from legislators in the para-political cases. 

¶3. (U) Uribe used an August 13 meeting with his Congressional 
coalition on judicial reform to slam the courts for nepotism. 
 The president said the courts had developed a system of 
"judicialclientalism" focused on garnering jobs for family 
members and allies throughout the different judicial 
institutions.  Uribe urged Congressional leaders to move 
forward on a controversial judicial reform proposal (reftel), 
and chastised members of Congress for being "cowards" in the 
face of para-political investigations.  Uribe insisted that 
Congress move ahead with the reform, saying "we cannot speak 
with fear!"  Several legislators claimed to be afraid to 
support the reform package out of fear they would be later 
investigated by the court. 

COURT RESPONDS 
-------------- 
¶4. (U) The Supreme Court quickly rejected Uribe's statements 
and backed Velasquez, who said he would remain in office. 
The Supreme Court issued a declaration on August 12 that 
noted the seriousness of the Uribe/Gutierrez allegations and 
asked the Fiscalia to investigate the charges.  The court 
also asked the Fiscalia to investigate the court investigator 
taped by Gutierrez.  On August 14, the court issued a 
statement that it would provide both the Interamerican Court 
on Human Rights and the International Criminal Court 
information on supposed interference by the GOC in judicial 
affairs.  Velasquez, who previously suggested he might quit 
due to political pressure, said he would continue his 
para-political investigations.  In a series of high-profile 
interviews in the local press, Velasquez defended his actions 
point-by-point, and alleged that he and other magistrates 
have been victims of a "dirty tricks" campaign mounted out of 
the Casa de Narino. 

"POINT OF NO RETURN" 
-------------------- 
¶5. (C) Presidential Communications Director Jorge Mario 
Eastman told us Uribe's relations with the Supreme Court had 
reached a "point of no return."  Recent meetings with Supreme 
Court magistrates did nothing to improve executive-judicial 
relations.  Eastman said Uribe had a history with Velasquez 

dating back to Antioquia, and claimed that Velasquez--as well 
as other magistrates--were "out to get" Uribe and his 
political allies.  He reiterated the GOC view that some 
magistrates have criminal ties to former paramilitaries as 
well as links to the opposition, but admitted he had no proof 
to back up his allegations.  Eastman denied any Casa de 
Narino involvement in efforts to discredit Velasquez or other 
magistrates. 

¶6. (C) Eastman said the GOC remains committed to its judicial 
reform package, but misjudged the reaction of the judiciary 
and Congress.  He said Interior and Justice Minister Fabio 
Valencia Cossio did not expect the entire judiciary to oppose 
his initial draft.  The reform was drafted by Valencia--as 
well as Eastman and Jose ObdulioGaviria--but Valencia has 
taken the hit inside the Casa de Narino for the proposal's 
poor start.  Luz Gutierrez, Valencia's Congressional liaison 
officer, told us the minister, a long-time senator himself, 
overestimated his ability to charm the courts and to move the 
reform quickly in Congress. 

SOME MAGISTRATES AGAINST URIBE 
------------------------------ 
¶7. (C) National Police Commander General Oscar Naranjo told 
us he agreed that some magistrates have allowed politics to 
influence their judicial rulings.  The court's judicial 
tactics, including evaluation of witness credibility, has 
been flawed in some case.  He noted that the jailing of 
para-politicians during preliminary stages of investigations 
("indagatoria"), as opposed to the later accusation phase of 
judicial proceedings, was uncommon and had led to suspicions 
of political bias.  Naranjo said Magistrate Yesid Ramirez had 
ties to known Italian narco-trafficker Giorgio Sale, but 
added that most magistrates were clean. 

¶8. (C) Naranjo said President Uribe constantly pushes him to 
provide added security to Court magistrates, leading him to 
discount any Uribe involvement in a dirty tricks campaign 
against the court.  Still, he said presidential advisor Jose 
ObdulioGavaria was behind a recent attempt to discredit 
Velasquez using former paramilitaries in Medellin.Naranjo
noted that former Senator Mario Uribe had orchestrated a 
similar effort involving a former paramilitary ("Tasmania") 
who claimed Velasquez had offered him legal benefits to 
implicate Uribe in a murder.  During the subsequent Fiscalia
investigation, "Tasmania" recanted his testimony.  He claimed 
that he had been paid by former paramilitary Juan Carlos 
Sierra (El Tuso), who was recently extradited to the United 
States, to make the false allegations.
