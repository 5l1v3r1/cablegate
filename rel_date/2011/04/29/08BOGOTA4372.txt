TAGS: PGOV PINR CO
SUBJECT: POSSIBLE URIBE REELECTION IN 2010 INCREASINGLY 
UNLIKLEY AS CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE IS POSTPONED UNTIL 2009 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Prospects for a possible third term for 
President Uribe in 2010 look increasingly unlikely.  Congress 
announced it would delay further debate on the bill that 
could permit Uribe to run again in 2010 until March 2009, and 
key Uribista supporters have publicly dismissed the 2010 
option. Interior and Justice Minister Fabio Valencia Cossio 
urged Congress to reconsider the delay, but with the current 
congressional session ending on December 16, time is running 
out.  Uribe told visiting FBI Director Robert Mueller that he 
no longer sees the possibility of running in 2010, but would 
like to keep open the option of a constitutional reform that 
would let him run in 2014.  Meanwhile, the driver of the 2010 
referendum initiative--Senator Luis Giraldo--resigned as U 
Party Secretary General amid a growing controversy over the 
financing of the referendum initiative.  End Summary. 
 
President's Allies Raise Concerns 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) In separate interviews on December 5-8, 2008, 
high-profile supporters of President Uribe rejected the 
effort to amend the Constitution to allow Uribe to run again 
in 2010 and questioned the tactics used by amendment 
advocates.  In an interview on December 5, Fabio Echeverri 
Correa, Uribe's campaign manager in the 2002 and 2006 
presidential elections, said the "referendum lacks 
legitimacy" and urged Uribe to defer any reelection 
possibilities until 2014.  On December 7, Luis Alberto 
Moreno, President of the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IDB) and Uribe's first Ambassador to the United States, said 
a a third term would not be good for the country or for 
Uribe.  Uribe told FBI director Robert Mueller on December 9 
that he no longer sees the possibility of running in 2010, 
but does not want to close the door on a possible 2014 bid. 
 
 
New Problems Arise Over Referendum 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) In early December, new questions arose over funding 
for the referendum petition.  Echeverri voiced concern that 
Senator Luis Guillermo Giraldo, who has managed the 
reelection effort, has been unable to explain who provided 
1.9 billion pesos (835,000 USD) in financing for the 
referendum petition, well over the legal limit of 335 million 
pesos (147,000 USD).  Several observers allege that public 
contractors illegally channeled contributions through a 
private foundation, which subsequently "lent" the funds to 
the referendum effort.  Echeverri told us privately that 
Giraldo is an "opportunist" who has been tied to numerous 
financial scandals.  Publicly, Echeverri said the doubts over 
the initiative's funding put the legitimacy of the whole 
referendum process in question. 
 
Giraldo Holds U Party Line, But Resigns 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) In a December 8 interview, Giraldo defended the 
initiative's funding and publicly disputed claims of 
irregularities in the collection of signatures.  Still, 
Giraldo failed to clarify the sources of the funding used to 
promote the referendum initiative, and--in the face of 
growing criticism--resigned on December 9 from his post as 
Secretary General of the U Party.   The National Electoral 
Advisor (CNE) continues its preliminary inquiry to establish 
if the supporters of the referendum did anything irregular or 
illegal in the collection of signatures for approval of the 
referendum and/or in its financing. 
 
Referendum Postponed Until March 2009 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) House President German Varon announced on December 9 
that Congress would delay the second debate on the referendum 
bill until the next session of Congress in March, 2009.  He 
said this was to ensure that other priority legislation--such 
as the Victims and Political Reform bills--received adequate 
attention.  Interior and Justice Minister Fabio Valencia 
urged Congress not to delay consideration of the referendum, 
but appeared to have little support.  Giraldo claimed that 
postponement of congressional consideration of the referendum 
until March would condemn it to a "slow death."  It would be 
 
hard to complete the required three congressional votes, 
Constitutional Court review, and referendum in time to allow 
Uribe to run in 2010.  Under current law, a president must 
legally declare his intention to seek reelection six months 
before the election (which would require Uribe to declare in 
November 2009). 
 
¶6. (C) Varon's party, Cambio Radical, and some other Uribista 
legislators oppose allowing Uribe to run again in 2010, and 
have cooperated with opposition efforts to stall or derail 
the bill.  House Secretary General Jesus Rodriguez told us 
that many members of Congress remain concerned over Uribe's 
failure to take a public stance in favor of reelection.  They 
are also troubled by the doubts surrounding the referendum's 
funding.  Congressmen Tarquino Pacheco called Valencia's call 
for Congress to consider the referendum bill in the current 
legislative session a clear signal of Uribe's support for the 
referendum, but it is unclear how many other legislators will 
agree.
