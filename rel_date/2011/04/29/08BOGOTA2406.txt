SUBJECT: COLOMBIAN MILITARY RESCUES AMERICAN HOSTAGES, 
INGRID BETANCOURT 
 
Â¶1.  Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos announced on July 
2 that the Colombian military had rescued American hostages 
Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and Keith Stansell, along with 
Ingrid Betancourt and eleven members of the Colombian 
security forces, from the FARC.  Military intelligence 
rescued the hostages from an area south of San Jose de 
Guaviare in a secret operation titled "Operation Jaque." 
Santos said the unprecedented operation incurred no injuries 
or deaths. He added that the Colombian military had 
"infiltrated" the FARC Secretariat, as well as the FARC's 
First Front which was holding the hostages, as part of the 
operation.  Santos called on all FARC to lay down their arms 
and demobilize. The Colombian military also captured two FARC 
members, including First Front commander Gerardo Antonio 
Aguilar, alias "Cesar," and Alexander Farfan, alias "Enrique 
Gafas." Santos said the military would hand "Cesar" over to 
Colombian judicial authorities.  The American hostages are 
wheels up at 6:15 PM en route to the United States tonight.
