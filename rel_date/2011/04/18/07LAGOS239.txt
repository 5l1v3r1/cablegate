¶1.  This is a response to an action request or details on 
Indoor Air Pollution (IAP) in Nigeria.  A septel will be sent 
assessing the GON's awareness of and commitment to reduce 
IAP.  According to Ministry of Petroleum Resources, household 
kerosene is used 99 percent of the time as an energy source 
in Nigeria; kerosene and wood are the most common cooking 
fuels.  Residential demand provides approximately 50 percent 
of the world's liquefied petroleum (LP) gas demand.  However, 
Nigerian LP gas consumption has averaged around 60,000 tons 
annually over the past decade; quite low by world standards.

Delta State Is A Member Under The PCIA

¶2.  Delta State, located in the oil producing Niger Delta, is 
a member of Project Gaia, under the Partnership for Clean 
Indoor Air (PCIA).  Neighboring Bayelsa state is not a 
Project Gaia partner, but is interested in importing methanol 
stoves and fuel for indoor cooking.

Methanol Stoves: Public-Private Collaboration 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  The Delta State Ministry of Power and Energy, in 
partnership with Project Gaia under the PCIA began a pilot 
project in November 2006 to test the demand for methanol 
stoves in high, medium, and low income households in Delta 
State.  Following the initial positive feedback and interest 
in methanol as a cooking fuel, USAID has begun facilitating 
stakeholder meetings with Delta and Bayelsa state 
governments, oil companies, methanol plant construction 
companies, and stove manufacturers to discuss and possibly 
move forward with the production and use of methanol plants 
and cooking stoves. 
 
¶4.  The stakeholders agree methanol would increase 
communities' access to affordable energy as well as reduce 
gas flaring by oil companies and indoor pollution.  Methanol 
is approximately 15-30 cents per liter less expensive than 
kerosene.  With coordinated public information and proper 
training in the use and storage of methanol and methanol 
stoves, the project is expected to improve some 200,000 rural 
families' (approximately 1 million people) access to clean, 
effective cooking fuel and electrification.  (Note: There is 
no quantifiable data available on IAP in Nigeria at this 
time. End Note.) 
 
¶5.  To relieve both indoor and outdoor air pollution, the 
Government of Nigeria is making efforts to promote the 
production and supply of liquefied petroleum gas (propane) in 
Nigeria, which is expected to offset emissions from burning 
wood, charcoal, kerosene and dried dung.  A worst-case 
scenario of wood use conducted by the Federal Ministry of 
Petroleum Resources predicted emissions of approximately 
44,460 megatons a year of particulate matter and 4,323 
megatons a year of oxides of nitrogen from burning wood in 
¶2010.

Needed: Increased Public and Government Awareness

¶6.  The GON and Nigerian public need to better understand and 
be aware of indoor air pollution before it can be tackled. 
Presenting IAP to the federal and state governments would be 
a first step in improving indoor air quality.  Public 
awareness campaigns are needed to highlight the dangers of 
IAP.  Projects such as Gaia could be presented to other 
states, particularly in oil producing areas, which could 
benefit both from reduced gas flaring and creation of a new 
energy market.  (Note: The GON will undergo its first 
transition from one democratically elected government to 
another in May 2007; approaching the federal and state 
government of Nigeria would be most advantageous once the new 
administrations have settled in. End Note.)
