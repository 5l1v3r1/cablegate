SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: TERRORISM FINANCE 
PRE-NOTIFICATION OF UPCOMING UNSCR 1267 LISTING REQUEST FOR 
THREE INDIVIDUALS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 49793 
 
Classified By: A/POL Robert B. Andrew for reason 1.4 (d). 
 
¶1. (C) On May 12, we delivered reftel demarche to Carlos 
Cordero of the MFA's Department of Disarmament, Terrorism and 
Organized Crime. Cordero informed us that Costa Rica had no 
formal mechanisms to freeze assets for 1267 listings. He 
added that the MFA's procedure for 1267 notifications was to 
pass the names to DIS (Costa Rican intelligence) to 
coordinate with Interpol. The MFA also passes the names to 
SUGEF and SUGEVAL, Costa Rican independent governmental 
oversight agencies for banking and for the stock exchange, 
respectively. 
 
¶2. (C) Cordero told us he would protect the information until 
the U.S. made its formal request. We do not anticipate that 
the GOCR will co-sponsor the listing.
