Quito, December 4, 2009 
 
 
 
Mrs. 
 
Hillary Clinton 
 
Secretary of State of the United States of America 
 
 
 
Mrs. Secretary, 
 
 
 
I am thankful for the contents of your November 25 letter regarding 
the Cooperation Agreement on Defense between the United States of 
America and Colombia, and the reassurances that it will be 
implemented in accordance with international law and respecting the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries. 
 
 
 
In this regard, I am sending you the text of the Resolution 
approved on November 27 by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the 
Ministers of Defense of the Union of South American Nations - 
UNASUR-   about Trust and Security Actions.  At that time, the 
decision of the UNASUR Chief of States and Government to strengthen 
South America as a peace zone was ratified. 
 
 
 
Additionally, by confirming that UNASUR is the appropriate forum, 
we extend an invitation to the Government of the United States of 
America to maintain a dialogue with the purpose of addressing 
topics of vital importance to the region, on a date and in a place 
to be agreed upon via diplomatic channels, through the Pro Tempore 
Presidency exercised by Ecuador. 
 
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
(Signed) 
 
 
 
Rafael Correa Delgado 
 
President of the Republic of Ecuador 
 
Pro Tempore President of the Union of South American Nations
