SUBJECT: FM BAN KI-MOON CONVEYS CONGRATULATIONS ON KILLING
OF ZARQAWI
(SBU) Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon, during a June 9 meeting
with Washington DC Mayor Anthony Williams, asked the
Ambassador to convey to Secretary Rice -- and through her, to
the U.S. military and all members of the Iraqi coalition --
Korea's congratulations on the killing of Abu Musab
al-Zarqawi. Ban noted that the entire international
community, Korea's Zaytun unit, and the family of former
South Korean hostage Kim Sun-il (beheaded by Zarqawi in June
2004) can breathe a sigh of relief. He underscored Korea's
continued solidarity with the Untied States in the war on
terror.
