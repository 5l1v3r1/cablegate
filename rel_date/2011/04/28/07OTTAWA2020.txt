SUBJECT: CANADA: (2/5) 220TH MEETING OF THE U.S.-CANADA 
PERMANENT JOINT BOARD ON DEFENSE - VISION AND PRINCIPLES 
DOCUMENT 
 
¶1. (U) U.S. Co-Chairman George Nethercutt and Canadian 
Co-Chairman Rick Casson, M.P. convened the 220th meeting of 
the Permanent Joint Board on Defense (PJBD) at the Canadian 
Maritime Warfare Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia October 9-11, 
2007 (septels).  This is the second in a series of five 
telegrams.  It documents the PJBD's deliberations on the 
Vision and Principles Document.

Vision and Principles 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) Director General (DG) for 
International Security Don Sinclair launched the discussion 
of the Vision and Principles Document by noting that Prime 
Minister Harper supported it and that it should serve to 
guide the PJBD and the relevant elements of the two 
governments in the future.  Canadian Military Policy 
representative Major General Chris Davis asserted that the 
Document would show that the CANUS defense and security 
establishments were adapting and evolving.  With the backing 
of our national leaders, he said, it would also give us the 
power to move our respective domestic policies in the right 
direction. 
 
¶3. (SBU) DG Sinclair noted that Canada would like to launch 
the Document at the commemoration of NORAD's 50th anniversary 
in May 2008 as a way to re-emphasize the two countries' 
common vision for continental security and to draw public 
attention to our "deep and enduring" partnership.  The next 
step for the Canadian side would be to have the foreign, 
defense, and public safety ministers clear the Document and 
table it in Cabinet.  To this end, the Canadians would like a 
signal from the U.S. side that it, too, is ready to press 
ahead.  NORAD Deputy Commander LtGen Charles Bouchard said 
NORAD would plan for the Document to be featured at the NORAD 
commemoration.  U.S. NSC Representative Richard Miles 
observed that the next scheduled opportunity for the 
President and the Prime Minister to meet could occur as early 
as April 2008, during the North American Leaders' Summit at a 
venue to be determined in the U.S. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Co-Chair Nethercutt responded that the U.S. side was 
satisfied with the language in the Document and said that he 
would ask the secretaries of State, Homeland Security, and 
Defense to seek the President's direct involvement, perhaps 
to include signing the Document alongside the Canadian Prime 
Minister at the NORAD commemoration.  State Department 
WHA/CAN Office Director Alex Lee said he would staff it with 
a view towards having it ready for leaders' signatures in 
¶2008.  Sinclair interjected that he would do the same on the 
Canadian side, and Co-Chair Casson ended the discussion by 
noting there was consensus on the need to complete and tee-up 
the Document quickly.

Canada-United States defence and security cooperation 
reflects our shared geography, contiguous borders, 
international commitments and interests, and a common 
Qinternational commitments and interests, and a common 
understanding of the threats and vulnerabilities facing our 
two countries.  We are committed to protecting our citizens, 
while promoting democracy, human rights, prosperity, 
opportunity and a better quality of life.  We have stood fast 
by each other for decades in facing challenges at home and 
abroad. Taking a coherent approach to defence and security 
requires that we have the capacity to address new challenges. 
 The bedrock of the Canada-U.S. defence and security 
relationship is our ability to act effectively, in a timely 
and coordinated fashion, consistent with our national 
interests and sovereignty, to detect, deter, disrupt, and 
 
OTTAWA 00002020  002 OF 002 
 
 
defeat military and terrorist threats to Canada and the 
United States, as far from our borders as possible. We also 
cooperate in non-military security matters, such as border 
operations, critical infrastructure protection and emergency 
management. 
 
Fundamentals of the relationship: 
-- North American defence and security is a shared 
responsibility 
-- Our unique geographic relationship and integrated 
economies make the security and prosperity of our countries 
inter-dependent 
-- An attack against either country is an attack on both 
-- As members of the broader international community we have 
a common responsibility for promoting global peace and 
security 
-- We have a mutual commitment to peace, democracy and human 
rights and we strive to promote these values in ways that are 
shaped by our distinct histories, cultures and roles in the 
world 
-- We rely upon an integrated defence industrial and 
technology base 
-- We work in partnership for the protection of shared 
critical infrastructure in North America 
 
For the continued success of our defence and security 
relations we must: 
(1)  recognize that we are more secure when we address 
continental issues together than when we act alone; 
(2)  prevent the territories of our countries from being used 
by third parties to plan, launch or support attacks on the 
other; 
(3)  share relevant information and intelligence in a timely 
and efficient manner, consistent with our domestic laws and 
international legal obligations; 
(4).  prepare, plan, train, exercise and advise on responses 
to threats, natural and human-induced disasters, to 
facilitate the support by the other offered in time of need; 
(5)  cooperate on defense and security issues where common 
interests and concerns require an effective response to 
threats to peace and security before they reach our borders; 
(6)  support and collaborate on science and technology R&D in 
defense and security to equip ourselves with the necessary 
tools today and in the future to support our cooperative 
defense and security; 
(7)  facilitate interoperability and joint action, by putting 
in place the necessary structures and legal framework; and 
(8)  enhance existing mechanisms and where necessary create 
new ones, to address emerging challenges and improve 
consultation across the range of our endeavors.
