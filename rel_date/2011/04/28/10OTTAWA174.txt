SUBJECT: CANADA CRITICIZES IRAN'S ARRESTS OF BAHA'I FOLLOWERS 
 
REF: OTTAWA 162; STATE 12108 
 
¶1.   (U)  In a statement on February 14, Foreign Minister Lawrence 
Cannon criticized Iran for its recent detention of seven Baha'i 
followers, which he called "unacceptable,"  as well as for other 
human rights violations.  He called on Iran to adopt "meaningful 
change in its human rights practices."   His remarks echoed a 
recent expression of concern on human rights problems in Iran by 
Prime Minister Stephen Harper (ref a).   Full text in para 2. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin text 
 
 "Canada deplores Iran's detention of seven more members of the 
Iranian Baha'i community today. Alaeddin Khanjani, Ashkan Bassari, 
Maria Jafari Ehsani, Bashir Ehsani, Romina Zabihiyan and Houtan 
Sistani were arrested this morning.  Mona Misaghi was arrested on 
February 10, 2010.  These individuals appear to have been detained 
on the basis of their faith.  This is unacceptable.  We call on the 
Iranian authorities to ensure the immediate and safe release of 
these individuals, as well as all other members of the Baha'i 
community currently in detention, without delay. 
 
"Despite being a party to several human-rights conventions, Iran 
continues to disregard the rights of its people.  We urge Iran to 
live up to its commitments and obligations under domestic and 
international law, and to begin adopting meaningful change in its 
human rights practices. 
 
"Canada will continue to express its grave concerns regarding 
Iran's history of abuse against religious minorities.  For years, 
the Baha'i community in particular has been targeted by the Iranian 
government and subjected to persecution, discrimination and 
detention, despite the community's peaceful nature.  The Iranian 
government has waged a systematic propaganda campaign against the 
Baha'i faith, employing all forms of state-controlled media to 
incite hatred and suspicion against the Baha'i."
