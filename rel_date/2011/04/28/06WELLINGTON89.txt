¶1. (U) On February 1, New Zealand Disarmament and Arms 
Control Minister Phil Goff 
issued a public statement in support of the IAEA 
extraordinary meeting decision to 
report Iran's nuclear program to the UN Security Council. 
Goff, who is also New 
Zealand's Defense Minister, highlighted the concerns 
expressed by the United States 
and others about Iran's program.  The following is the 
complete text of the statement: 
 
¶2.  (U) Begin Text: 
 
NZ supports decision on Iran's nuclear programme 
 
New Zealand supports the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA)meeting to report Iran's nuclear 
programme to the United Nations Security Council 
 
--------------------------------- 
 
Disarmament and Arms Control Minister Phil Goff 
expressed New Zealand's support for the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) extraordinary meeting in 
Vienna on February 2 and 3 to report Iran's nuclear 
programme to the United Nations Security Council. 
 
"The unanimity of the concerns expressed by Britain, 
France, Germany, Russia, China and the United States 
should send a strong and clear message to Iran," Mr 
Goff said. 
 
"Earlier this month, New Zealand expressed its strong 
concern at Iran's decision to remove IAEA seals on 
uranium enrichment equipment and material at Natanz 
and other facilities and to undertake research and 
development related to uranium enrichment." 
 
In a meeting with the Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki in 
London yesterday, Mr Goff urged Iran to re-establish its 
suspension of nuclear-related enrichment activities to 
comply with earlier IAEA Board of Governors' resolutions. 
 
"Iran has the right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes 
in conformity with Article 2 of the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. However it is essential that Iran meets concerns 
in the international community about aspects of its 
nuclear programme - what IAEA Director General has 
called 'a confidence deficit'," Mr Goff said. 
 
"New Zealand supports the course of action proposed by 
the six countries to report this issue to the UNSC. This is 
not a formal referral. We hope Iran will now respond 
positively to the concern of the broader international 
community and act to restore international confidence in 
its nuclear activities. 
 
"One proposal which offers promise of a potential 
solution is that put forward by Russia for Iran's 
enrichment activities to occur on Russian soil. 
 
"We also urge Iran to resume negotiations with the EU3 
in order to find a solution that meets our and the 
international community's concerns that the process of 
developing nuclear energy in Iran does not lead to the 
development of nuclear weapons capacity," Mr Goff said. 
End text. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  According to a Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFAT) contact, the expression of "strong concern" 
mentioned in paragraph 3 of the statement refers to a January 
12 statement by Foreign Minister Winston Peters.  Peters 
expressed concern about Iran's nuclear program, its decision 
to remove the IAEA seals on its enrichment 
equipment, and its stated intention to undertake 
enrichment-related research and development.  (The full 
statement may be found on www.beehive.govt.nz) 
 
¶4. (SBU) MFAT also tells us that Foreign Minister Mottaki's 
response to Minister Goff's approach was the "normal 
reaction," i.e. remarks to the effect that Iran has the right 
to pursue peaceful energy research.  MFAT staff have also 
 
repeatedly expressed concerns about Iran's program and recent 
actions to the Iranian Embassy here in Wellington, with 
similar results.  End Comment. 
 
¶5.  (U) Post is also forwarding reftel points to MFAT's 
Disarmamant Division, adding appreciation for New Zealand's 
support on this issue.
