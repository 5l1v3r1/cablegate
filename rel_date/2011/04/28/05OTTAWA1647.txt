NOMINATING-OFFICER: Timothy Nelson 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Joe Couto leads the recently opened Toronto office of the 
Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police (OACP), which 
focuses on government relations and was responsible for a 
breakthrough in government attitudes toward illicit drugs. 
The "Green Tide Summit" of 2003 forced Ontario's politicians 
to recognize that Ontario's booming marijuana production was 
an organized crime problem that is far larger than current 
policing capabilities to restrain. 
Couto has proposed deepening working-level contacts with 
U.S. counterparts on each of Ontario's most pressing law 
enforcement issues. He says that existing cooperation is not 
"intentional" - aimed at specific issues on a province-wide 
basis - but rather limited to high-level conference 
attendance segmented by agencies, or low-level cooperation 
on an as-needed basis among border towns. Couto would like 
to see greater institutionalized cooperation throughout 
Ontario's law enforcement agencies with U.S. counterparts by 
building issue-based, working-level cooperation that would 
enhance law enforcement capabilities to tackle prevailing 
criminal trends that affect both sides of the border. 
OACP, as the voice of Ontario law enforcement, intends to 
tackle Ontario's approach to the big issues of crime in 
Ontario. OACP's initiative created the Criminal Intelligence 
Service Ontario (CISO) under Ontario Provincial Police 
auspices to integrate police enforcement efforts toward 
organized crime. Other items on their agenda include child 
pornography, trafficking in persons, reforming Ontario's 
judicial system, and public education to reshape attitudes 
toward various crimes. 
Mr. Couto's participation in the EU RP Project on  Combating 
International Crime would serve the Mission goal of 
acquainting him with U.S. law enforcement perspectives and 
building stronger cooperation in securing both Canada and 
the United States from criminal threats.  Consultation with 
participants from other countries with similar criminal 
problems would enhance the value of the exchange.   Post 
looks forward to acceptance of Mr. Couto into this program.
