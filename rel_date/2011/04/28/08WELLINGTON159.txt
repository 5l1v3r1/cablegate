¶1. (SBU)  Summary.  The Government of New Zealand (GNZ) has agreed 
to buy back Australian-owned Toll Holdings Ltd. rail and ferry 
business in New Zealand for NZ$665 million (USD$520million).  This 
completes the renationalization of the railroads which a National 
Government privatized in 1982.  National Party's opposition leader, 
John Key said the repurchase did not make economic sense when 
householders were struggling to pay higher food, power and fuel 
prices and said the cost to taxpayers could top NZ$1 billion. 
Perhaps even more sensitive will the question of whether the Labour 
Party can afford to offer a long-promised tax cut after buying 
Toll's rail operations.  End Summary. 
 
Background to the Buyback 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  For most of its history, New Zealand's railways were 
administered by the New Zealand Railways Department, with the 
Minister of Railways being a member of Cabinet.  In 1982, the 
Railways Department was corporatized into the New Zealand Railway 
Corporation.  In 1990, the core rail operations of the Corporation 
were transferred to New Zealand Rail Limited, a state-owned 
enterprise (SOE).  New Zealand Rail Limited was privatized in 1993, 
with the new owners adopting the name Tranz Rail in 1995. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  In 2002 shares in Tranz Rail dropped to a record low price 
on the New Zealand Sharemarket (NZX) as a result of its poor 
financial state and mismanagement.  In 2003, Toll Holdings Ltd. of 
Australia made a successful takeover bid for Tranz Rail, subject to 
an agreement to sell back the rail and railbed to the government for 
$1.  It took over the rolling stock, freight and passenger 
operations. The government committed to NZ$200 million of taxpayer 
funding on deferred maintenance and capital improvements via the New 
Zealand Railways Corporation, now called OnTrack. 
 
The Buyback 
----------- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  The New Zealand Government this week spent NZ$665 million 
to repurchase Toll's rolling stock and rail ferries; that is three 
times the valuation that Toll put on the trains and rail ferries 
when it launched its takeover for the financially stressed Tranz 
Rail, in 2003.  Under the buyback scheme, Toll gets to keep for 
six-years rent-free Tranzlink's freight facilities, the company's 
NZ-based freight forwarding business, together with warehousing and 
contract logistics operations..  According to contacts at the 
Australian High Commission, this six-year control of the freight 
forwarding operations could be  worth an additional NZ$20 million to 
Toll.  This segment of the enterprise has been the profit-making 
part of Toll's business.  The Government has been left with a 
collection of leftover assets masquerading as a business, including 
outdated rolling stock, one owned and two leased ferries which will 
(now be added to the national track the Government bought in 2003) 
and a rail track that is still in dire need of major investment. 
 
The Reaction 
------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU)  The National Party criticized the purchase, saying the 
final cost could be over NZ$1 billion once needed improvements are 
factored in.  National Party leader, John Key said the purchase did 
not make sense when householders were struggling to pay higher food, 
power and fuel prices.  However, if it wins this year's election, 
the party won't sell because it doesn't think it could get the money 
back and has pledged not to sell State assets.  (Comment. The real 
reason for Key's promise not to sell is political.  Labour has tried 
to play on voters' fears that the National Party  will sell state 
assets if elected.  Key knows that issue is a loser for National. 
End Comment.).  A National Government sold the railways in 1993 
after the previous Labour Government first transformed it into an 
SOE.  Then Labour Transport Minister Richard Prebble (who later led 
the right-wing party ACT) said this new buyback would be "the most 
expensive purchase that the taxpayer's ever had to fund".  He said 
Labour botched buying back the rail network and failed to first get 
an agreement on sharing costs with the rail operator. 
 
The Way Forward 
--------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU)  In announcing the deal, Finance Minister Michael Cullen 
 
WELLINGTON 00000159  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
said preliminary work was being done on how much more the Government 
would have to spend on the rail system upgrades, which would be 
measured "in the hundreds of millions rather than the tens of 
millions."  Toll boss, Paul Little said "if we'd had a choice, Toll 
would probably have preferred not to have sold the rail and shipping 
assets but it had been unable to reach agreement with the Government 
over a raft of important issues."  Prime Minister Helen Clark says 
the renationalized railway system will be run in a business-like 
manner, but the Government was not doing it for financial returns. 
"We are not going into this to make money," per PM Clark.  Cullen 
has admitted the Government paid more than it would like for the 
rail stock, but said that when Toll bought the business 4-1/2 years 
ago, the Government had not been seriously looking at buying it 
back. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  According to some local journalists, the Beehive 
(Executive Offices) has talked about getting the country's national 
rail business back in Government ownership since early 2001. 
Despite seven years of a Labour-led government, there have been no 
published documents showing where a renationalized rail could add 
value to the development of the economy.  It did not figure in the 
Government's 2007 sustainable transport strategy which aims to halve 
greenhouse gas emissions from that sector by 2040.  That strategy 
also expected coastal shipping to double its share of the 
intra-regional freight market which would have boosted the country's 
ports businesses.  There will be considerable angst if the 
Government uses its rail assets as a loss leader to attract business 
away from existing road transport operators. 
 
¶8. (SBU)  This buyback is being contrasted with the Government's 
decision to bail out Air New Zealand in 2001.  Then, the GNZ did 
extensive analysis to backup its economic rationale for investing 
NZ$885 million in the ailing national flag carrier.  It had also 
mapped out how the airline would be governed.  In contrast, the 
government requested business consultant Beca to do a cost-benefit 
analysis only after the deal for the rail had been concluded.  PM 
Clark announced this week, "the deal was good for New Zealand but 
not because of its financial implications." 
 
Can the Government Afford a Railroad and a Tax Cut? 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶9. (SBU)  Comment. Despite the Labour Party's belief that the 
buyback will generate social dividends, it cannot escape the 
business challenges of running a profitable railroad whose chief 
competitor is an already established network of truck and ship 
transport.  It is still to be determined whether the New Zealand 
electorate will be persuaded that the high costs warrant returning 
Labour to office.  Most have been waiting for the income tax cut PM 
Clark has promised and Finance Minister Cullen has waffled on.  If 
Cullen offers too small a cut, when next year's Budget is announced 
on May 22nd,this sale could come back to haunt them
