¶1. (SBU) Summary: Ontario's unemployment rate continues to rise as 
manufacturing jobs disappear in Canada's industrial heartland. 
While the GOC has increased the number of weeks of unemployment 
benefits nationally, that will have limited benefit for unemployed 
Ontarians.  As the ranks of Ontario's unemployed rise and the number 
of contributors decline, the Province's traditional role as cash cow 
for federal unemployment insurance contributions will diminish, 
negatively affecting the entire program.  End Summary.

Manufacturing Slump, Job Losses 
------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The overall value of Canadian manufacturing shipments fell a 
record 8.0% between November and December 2008; the biggest decline 
in 17 years.  Ontario, where nearly 40% of Canada's population lives 
and nearly half of Canada's manufacturing takes place, saw an even 
greater decline of 9.2%.  From October 2008 to February 2009, 
Ontario lost 160,000 jobs, mostly in manufacturing.  Since October 
2008, just over half of Canada's total employment losses have 
occurred in Ontario, well above Ontario's portion of Canada's 
population. 
 
------------------------ 
Employment Insurance (EI) 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) In November 2008, 157,910 Ontarians collected the 
euphemistically-named Employment Insurance (EI) total regular 
benefits, up 4.5% from a month earlier, the biggest monthly increase 
among Canadian provinces, and a 28.2% jump from November 2007.  EI 
total regular benefits, which are under federal jurisdiction, 
provide temporary earnings replacement to individuals who lose their 
jobs through no fault of their own and who are available for work, 
but cannot find employment.  Oshawa (the home of GM Canada) saw 
Canada's greatest increase in people collecting EI in October and 
November 2008.  Windsor (Chrysler Canada's home) followed with a 
41.9% jump in October, and a 57.9% jump in November compared with 
the same months the previous year. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Benefits Differ Within, Among Provinces 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The value of EI benefits in Ontario, on a provincial 
population per capita basis, is the lowest among Canadian provinces. 
Only 44% of unemployed Canadians are drawing EI benefits.  In 
Ontario, the situation is worse - although current provincial 
figures are not available, in 2007 only 30% of unemployed Ontarians 
received EI total regular benefits, compared with an average of 58% 
in other provinces. 
 
¶5. (U) Ontario officials complain that while workers in northern 
Manitoba or Saskatchewan need only 420 insurable hours of employment 
to qualify for EI, the federally-run EI program mandates that 
Ontario employees must work more qualifying hours for fewer 
benefits.  Workers in Oshawa, for example, must have 630 qualifying 
hours to receive EI. 
 
¶6. (U) The differences also are regional.  In Windsor, Ontario, an 
unemployed auto worker needs to work 105 fewer hours than his 
colleague at a GM plant in Oshawa, Ontario to receive up to five 
more weeks of benefits.  Another wrinkle in Canada's EI program is 
that eligibility for EI is a prerequisite to participate in 
EI-supported re-training programs.  The difference relates largely 
to Windsor's historically higher unemployment rate. 
 
¶7. (U) While Ontario workers and employers contributed nearly 40% of 
the total EI premiums collected by the GOC in 2007, Ontarians 
received only 27% of the total benefits associated with EI.  That 
year, the average benefits per unemployed person was about C$5,110 
in Ontario, compared with C$9,070 in the rest of Canada, amounting 
to a difference of roughly C$1.7 billion for Ontario's 450,000 
unemployed. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment: Ontarians' comparatively lower EI benefits relate 
to a complicated national formula whereby those living in areas with 
historically higher unemployment find it easier to qualify for and 
access EI benefits.  Still, the comparative statistics are stark in 
a time of high unemployment.  The GOC's 2009 budget means that 
laid-off Ontarians, if found eligible, will benefit from an 
additional five weeks of benefits, but this still falls short of

addressing the inequalities faced by Ontario's unemployed.  We 
expect Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty to call for further federal 
government assistance when the province releases its budget on March 
¶26.  If McGuinty wins more benefits for Ontario's jobless, that may 
mollify some, but it will also add pressure to Canada's EI program - 
not only from the growing number of EI applicants in Ontario, but 
also due to the shrinking number of workers in Canada's largest pool 
of unemployment insurance contributors.
