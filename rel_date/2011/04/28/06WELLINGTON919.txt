(U) Econoff delivered reftel demarche regarding the EU 
Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) to Kathy Perreau, Policy 
Advisor at the Ministry of Transport (MOT). Post stressed 
that the U.S. has serious concerns regarding the EU proposal, 
which seeks to extend the EU scheme to non-EU airlines. We 
urged the GNZ to express concerns to ICAO and the European 
Commission. Perreau noted that GNZ is troubled by the 
proposed scheme and is in the process of formulating a 
response. Post will forward MOT's position paper when it is 
made available.
