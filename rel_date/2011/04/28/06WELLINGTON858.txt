REF: (A) STATE 180512, (B) WELLINGTON 834 
 
Classified By: DCM David J. Keegan for Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
(C) In response to ref (A), demarche was delivered to Carolyn 
Schwalger, Senior Advisor for North Asia at the New Zealand Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) on November 1, 2006.  Per 
Schwalger, GNZ has regulations in place to be able to enforce UNSCR 
Â¶1718.  Both the interagency and judicial divisions are working well 
together to implement, see ref (B).  MFAT will share contents of the 
demarche with relevant divisions throughout the New Zealand 
government.  Also per MFAT, NZ businesses have no known connection to 
KOMID but will check to ensure there is not secondary entities or 
intermediaries dealing with them.
