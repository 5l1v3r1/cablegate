for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (U) On May 18, 2006, PolCouns shared the revised MOU and 
talking points provided reftel with Deborah Panckhurst of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (MFAT) Disarmament 
Division.  Panckhurst said that she has also been in contact 
with DOE's Mike Stafford about this issue.   MFAT will 
respond to our changes once the Ministry lawyer involved with 
the MOU, Caroline Bilkey, has reviewed it. 
 
¶2.  (C) Panckhurst said NZ officials are concerned they will 
face public and opposition criticism if they cannot visit a 
taxpayer-funded assistance project.  DOE has provided some 
indication that other donors have accepted similar 
restrictions, but additional information would be very 
helpful. 
 
¶3.  (C) We have also told Panckhurst that Embassy is willing 
to approach opposition parties at the highest levels as 
needed, to urge that they not make a political issue of this 
important project.
