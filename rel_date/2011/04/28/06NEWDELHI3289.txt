Comment 
------- 
 
¶3.  (C) Based on Afrasiab's CV and what we understand about 
staffing patterns and priorities in the Pakistan Foreign 
Ministry, Afrasiab appears to be a strog candidate for a 
future senior return posting to the US, either to Washington 
or to the Pakistan Mission to the UN in New York.  During his 
May 11 courtesy call on the DCM and PolCouns he demonstrated 
his deep knowledge of how the USG operates, which his 
multiple US-related postings would suggest.  For example, 
Afrasiab was Desk Officer for the US when Ambassador Arnold 
Raphel was posted to Islamabad, and he recalls Ambassador 
Powell from her Pakistan tours as well. 
 
¶4.  (C) Afrasiab has a more formal demeanor than his 
predecessor.  A Qureshi, he hails from Muzzafargarh in 
Pakistani Punjab.  Afrasiab during his courtesy call 
demonstrated a hard focus on what he called "the core issue" 
between India and Pakistan (i.e. a territorial agreement 
regarding Jammu and Kashmir, which from his perspective would 
favor Islamabad). 
 
¶5.  (C) Pakistan High Commission First Secretary Khalid 
Jamali noted to Poloff that Afrasiab was coming to New Delhi 
at a time of high turnover at the High Commission.  In 
addition to most of their Political Section rotating out 
(Jamali to Islamabad), High Commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan 
(Reftel) would complete his tour by August.  Jamali said he 
has not yet heard who will replace Aziz.
