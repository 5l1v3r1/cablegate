REF: STATE 124579 
 
¶1.      (U)  Since the arrival of Hamilton's first female Consul 
General at post in August, women's groups in Bermuda have been 
reaching out to the U.S. Consulate.  Previously the Consulate 
had not done much work on women's issues, but the Consulate is 
now exploring the particular areas of interest identified reftel 
to determine where we can make the most impact. 
 
 
 
¶2.      (SBU)  The Consulate is meeting with civil society, 
NGOs, and government representatives, but there are not yet any 
ongoing programs.  The Chamber of Commerce has asked the Consul 
General to participate in "Wonder Women," a program that 
addresses local women leaders at the top level of business.  The 
Consul General has also been involved in exploratory discussions 
with women ministers and other women politicians about programs 
to increase the number of women in political life.  Only three 
of the Bermuda Government's 11-member cabinet are women, and 
there are only two women shadow ministers. 
 
 
 
¶3.      (U)  Among other groups reaching out to the Consul 
General is the Center for Leadership (CFL), an organization 
focused on fostering better leadership opportunities for women. 
The CFL works with local and international organizations to 
expand and promote development opportunities for women, to 
promote research to advance the development of women and to 
provide women with opportunities for networking and fostering 
professional relationships.  The Consul General has also been in 
contact with the International Women's Club-Bermuda (IWC).  The 
IWC is American in concept but international in scope and brings 
together over 250 members from 18 countries to share common 
interests. 
 
 
 
¶4.      (U)  The arrival of the first woman Consul General has 
resonated in Bermuda and thus brings a greater opportunity for 
the U.S. to become involved in women's issues in Bermuda.  We 
have begun to do that and look forward to increasing engagement 
on women's issue in the coming months. The CFL has expressed an 
interest in hosting a speaker on women's issues from the State 
Department or the U.S. and post requests Department's 
consideration of possible speakers.
