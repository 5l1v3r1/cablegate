SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050119469 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050119469 for the export 
of an inertial measurement unit to New Zealand.  Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. 
 Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  Unfamiliar foreign consignee and 
end-user Geospatial Research Centre Limited.  The company has 
not appeared on any previous license applications, nor have 
the bona fides of the company been verified by a Blue Lantern 
check. 
 
¶4. ACTION:  Department requests that Embassy make appropriate 
inquiries to verify the bona fides of foreign consignee and 
end-user Geospatial Research Centre Limited, and to confirm 
the legitimacy of this proposed transaction.  PM/DTCC also 
requests that post conducts a site visit to the company in 
order to provide Department with an assessment of its 
business operations and on-site security.  Finally, post is 
asked to assess whether the company appears to be a reliable 
recipient of USML items.  If a site visit is not possible, 
please inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item?  Will 
Geospatial Research Centre Limited retain positive control 
over the inertial measurement unit at all times or will your 
company lease the system to your customers?  Who exactly are 
these customers and where are they located?  Are they all 
located in New Zealand?  Will the inertial measurement unit 
be taken outside of New Zealand?  If so, where? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of its business -- what type of items 
does it handle, does it serve as a broker? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports? 
 
END ACTION
