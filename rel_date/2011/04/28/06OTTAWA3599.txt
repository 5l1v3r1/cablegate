SUBJECT: CANADIAN RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE REGARDING OECD 
WORKING GROUP ON BRIBERY 
 
REF: STATE 197786 
 
¶1. (U) On December 15, Economic Minister-Counselor delivered 
reftel demarche on the OECD Working Group on Bribery (WGB) to 
Mark Moher, Senior Coordinator, International Crime and 
Terrorism, Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT).  Moher promised to share its contents with 
Lisette Lafontaine, Senior Counsel, Criminal Law Policy 
Section, Department of Justice. 
 
¶2. (U) Moher opined that Canada is sympathetic to most of the 
demarche points, particularly the importance of 
accountability in implementing obligations under the 
Anti-Bribery Convention and the need for greater outreach to 
emerging economies.  DFAIT is asking the GoC for more money 
for the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).  Canada 
believes that the WGB process thus far has been useful, but 
wonders if the OECD work might eventually try to impose 
requirements beyond the scope of the UN Convention. 
 
¶3. (U) Moher said that his government noted concerns flagged 
by the WGB Chairman at the October meeting that, over time, 
the Working Group deliberations could become more 
bureaucratic and redundant, previous work priorities fall 
off, and the level of participation in deliberations drops. 
Canada agrees with the U.S. assertion that the OECD's 
anti-bribery efforts complements the UNCAC, which, Moher 
thought, is a better instrument for approaching major 
emerging economies, such as India and China.  The WGB effort 
is very valuable and generates useful material that can be 
used effectively in other fora.  Canada awaits the results of 
this week's UNCAC meeting in Amman. 
 
¶4. (U) Moher did not perceive a policy difference between 
Canada and the U.S., but said there could be a tactical 
disagreement on how to get the "optimal balance" for the sake 
of efficiency between the OECD and UN Conventions.  He 
thanked the U.S. for its demarche which will be distributed 
to senior DFAIT and Justice officials involved in the 
Canadian government policy process on bribery.  If there is a 
further substantive reaction by the GoC to the demarche, 
Moher promised to provide it by December 19.
