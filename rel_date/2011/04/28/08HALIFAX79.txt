SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. Atlantic Canadians are divided on how they see the political 
situation in Ottawa unfolding. Some are embracing the idea of an 
opposition coalition.  Others are more worried that the 
political instability is diverting attention away from the 
bigger issue of how to deal with the current economic crisis. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------ 
POLITICAL REACTION 
------------------ 
 
¶2.  The Atlantic region's 32 MPs featured prominently in the 
media on December 1 with their spin on the developments in 
Ottawa.  Conservative heavyweights such as Peter MacKay 
continued to question the legitimacy of the opposition coalition 
and called on Nova Scotians to support the Harper government. 
While it is unclear what influence MacKay's pleas will have on 
the electorate, it appears he can scratch fellow Nova Scotia 
Independent MP Bill Casey off his list of would-be supporters. 
Casey came out on December 1 to say he would vote against the 
Harper government in the House.  At the same time Casey said he 
would not be endorsing the opposition coalition since he was not 
part of the discussions leading to its formation and accordingly 
is unsure of their plans and goals.  Other regional MPs such as 
Liberal Roger Cuzner, who serves as the Liberal party whip in 
the House, said he was excited by the prospect of a new 
coalition government but said he was concerned about venturing 
into what he saw as unchartered constitutional waters. 
 
¶3.  At the provincial level, the four Atlantic premiers are 
being careful not to get drawn into what Tory Premier Williams 
of Newfoundland-Labrador called a "constitutional issue." 
Nonetheless, his regional counterparts, Liberal New Brunswick 
Premier Shawn Graham and Tory Premier Rodney MacDonald of Nova 
Scotia, have expressed their concern that federal politicians 
need to bring about some stability in government so they can 
focus on the current economic crisis.  Other provincial 
politicians were not as reticent about expressing their 
opinions.  Premier Williams' Liberal and NDP opposition foes 
have been quick to endorse the coalition and have gone as far as 
speculating which of the province's seven MPs might get the nod 
to sit in the new Liberal-NDP cabinet. 
 
-------------- 
PUBLIC OPINION 
-------------- 
 
¶4.  The nascent coalition is getting warm support from regional 
labor leaders with the Newfoundland-Labrador Federation of Labor 
saying its members want to send a message of support by holding 
a rally later this week in St. John's.  Federation president 
Lana Payne said on December 2 she believes the coalition would 
put Canadians first and make Parliament work. This is the same 
message that the Halifax Chronicle Herald said in its December 2 
lead editorial.  Headlined, "Coalition government appears 
likely," it commented that if Mr. Harper is unable to run an 
effective minority government then the "other guys" should have 
a chance to see what they're prepared to do.  However, one of 
post's academic contacts said he is unsure just how well the 
"other guys" could manage given that they do not appear to know 
where they are going and what they will do when they get there. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5.  From conversations with post's contacts, it appears Atlantic 
Canadians believe the Harper government is indeed in a 
precarious state.  One of post's longstanding New Brunswick 
political pundits commented that despite all the turmoil he 
still sees the PM hanging onto power.  However, it is getting 
harder to find others so sure in their predictions.  For now, 
the rhetoric continues here in Atlantic Canada as elsewhere in 
the country with the now familiar comment that Canada is indeed 
sailing into deep and unchartered waters. END COMMENT.
