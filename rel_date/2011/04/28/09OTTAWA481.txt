Note No. GGA-0028 
 
The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States 
of America and has the honour to refer to recent discussions 
between officials of our Governments, concerning 
military-to-military and other assistance in support of 
providing security for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games 
to be held in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
 
The Department wishes to advise the Embassy that Canada 
hereby requests the provision of the U.S. Postal Services' 
Mobile Mail Screening Station, with operating personnel, from 
the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, for a period between 
January 16 and March 26, 2010. This screening station, with 
trained operators, will ensure a safe and secure environment 
for Olympic staff, athletes, customers and facilities 
throughout the duration of these Games. The equipment 
contained in one 53' transportable trailer module will enable 
operators to detect any physical, chemical biological, 
radiological, nuclear or explosive threat. Canada Post Postal 
Inspectors are familiar with this equipment and have observed 
it operate at high profile events within the continental 
United States. 
 
The Department wishes to draw attention to the fact that 
confirmation of the availability of the requested 
capabilities is of critical importance to the planning 
process for the security of the Games and the preceding 
exercise. The Department would therefore be grateful for a 
response to this note within 30 days.  The Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade avails itself of this 
opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the United States of 
America the assurances of its highest consideration.
