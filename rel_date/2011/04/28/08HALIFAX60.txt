¶1.  SUMMARY: Premier Danny Williams of Newfoundland-Labrador has 
signed a lucrative deal with a Chevron-led consortium of oil 
companies to develop the Hebron oil field.  Daily production 
will be 150,000 to 170,000 barrels of oil with the majority 
available for export to the U.S. market. The first oil is 
expected to flow from the project sometime between 2016 and 
¶2018. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  The Government of Newfoundland-Labrador has successfully 
concluded an agreement to see the Hebron Oil field developed, 
making this the province's fourth offshore oil project (reftel). 
 On August 20 Premier Danny Williams, accompanied by his Natural 
Resources Minister Kathy Dunderdale, signed the deal with Hebron 
project partners, Chevron Canada (the designed project 
operator), Exxon Mobil, Petro-Canada and Statoil-Hydro Canada. 
With estimated recoverable reserves in the range of 400 million 
to 700 million barrels, Hebron will have a daily production of 
150,000 to 170,000 barrels of oil, the majority of which will be 
available for export to the U.S. marketplace.  Revenues to the 
province will be approximately $28 billion, adjusting for 
inflation, over the 20-25 year lifespan of the project. 
Construction of the Hebron gravity-based production platform and 
spin-offs will create an estimated 3,000 jobs.  The first oil is 
expected to flow from the project sometime between 2016 and 
¶2018. Full details of the agreement including the fiscal, 
benefits, and construction arrangements are available on the 
province's web site: 
www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/2008/exec/082 0n04.htm 
 
¶3.  Comment:  Accolades are already pouring in for Premier 
Williams, praising him for his dogged determination to get his 
province the best possible deal on development of its natural 
resources. The Premier's stance to hold out for a more lucrative 
deal on Hebron had put him at odds, not only with the oil patch, 
but often with local industry stakeholders who were anxious to 
see the Hebron project move along.  Now all that is forgotten 
with one commentator saying there is nothing but smiles around 
St. John's.  While it will take some time to analyze all the 
details of what the Premier calls a breakthrough agreement for 
his province, one thing that is immediately apparent is that 
Hebron will push the Premier's approval rating sky high.  With 
87 percent of the voters already approving of his leadership, 
any increase will guarantee the Premier a unique place in the 
province's history books.  End Comment.
