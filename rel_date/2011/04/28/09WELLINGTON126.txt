REF: STATE 55654 
 
On June 3, 2009, TDY DAO LtCol. Mike Pasco met with LtCol. 
Jim Maguire, Deputy Director for 
Defence Attache Coordination Assistance at the New Zealand 
Ministry of Defence (MOD) regarding 
the urgent request for assistance in identifying air assets 
for Pakistan (see reftel). 
LtCol Maguire made it clear that NZDF is fully committed to 
cooperation with the U.S. Military 
where possible in our shared national interest. However, he 
confirmed that NZDF does not have 
in its inventory (nor has access to) Mi-17 helicopters.
