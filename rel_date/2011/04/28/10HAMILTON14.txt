SUBJECT: BERMUDA DIRECTS BERMUDA FIRMS TO CEASE DOING BUSINESS WITH 
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN SHIPPING LINES 
 
Summary 
 
¶1.      (U) The Government of Bermuda (GOB) has taken 
expeditious and concrete steps to comply with international 
sanctions against Iran with the passage of new legislation and 
directives that strengthen Bermuda's Anti-Money 
Laundering/Anti-Terrorist Financing (AML/ATF) regime.  On 
January 15, 2010, the Minister of Justice issued an Order 
specifically prohibiting Bermuda financial firms from doing 
business with the Bank Mellat and the Islamic Republic of Iran 
Shipping Lines (IRISL).   The Minister stressed that Bermuda is 
committed to complying with international AML/ATF standards. 
End summary. 
 
 
 
¶2.      (SBU) In December the U.S. Treasury Department contacted 
the Consul General seeking action from Bermuda with respect to 
business transactions involving the Islamic Republic of Iran 
Shipping Lines (IRISL).   IRISL had obtained insurance through a 
company legally domiciled in Bermuda - the South of England 
Protection and Indemnity Association (SEPIA).  The Consul 
General immediately contacted the Bermuda Monetary Authority 
(BMA) and the National Anti-Money Laundering Committee (NAMLC), 
who indicated that the GOB was fast-tracking passage of the 
Anti-Terrorism (Financial and Other Measures) Amendment Act 2009 
(Amendment Act), and that implementation was a priority. 
Minister of Justice Kim Wilson noted that the GOB had been 
working with the U.K.'s HM Treasury on the legislation. 
 
 
 
¶3.      (SBU)  The GOB passed the Amendment Act on December 19, 
with effect from January 13, 2010.  The Act authorizes the 
Minister of Justice to restrict financial firms in Bermuda from 
doing business with entities connected with jurisdictions of 
concern regarding money laundering, terrorist financing or the 
proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear 
(CBRN) weapons.  On January 15, 2010, in conjunction with that 
act, which parallels  Schedule 7 of the UK Counter Terrorism Act 
2009, and at the request of the U.S. Treasury Department, the 
Minister of Justice  issued the "Anti-Terrorism (Financial 
Restrictions Iran) Order 2010" (Order).  Effective immediately, 
the Order prohibits all AML/ATF-regulated financial institutions 
or insurers from entering into, or continuing to participate in, 
any transaction or business relationship with "designated 
persons," specifically the Bank Mellat, the IRISL, or any branch 
thereof.  Wilson explained to the Consul General that Bank 
Mellat was not conducting business in Bermuda, but indicated 
Bermuda would follow the U.K.'s lead and include it in the 
Order.  The Order provides seven days for businesses to wind up 
existing contracts. 
 
 
 
¶4.      (U) Minister of Justice and Attorney General Wilson 
publicly stated on January 15 , "In the past, financial 
institutions have been prohibited from doing business with 
certain persons and entities as a result of international 
sanctions, but this is the first time that we have been able to 
take this type of action to protect the national interests of 
Bermuda.  Further, this legislation allows us for the first time 
to specifically take action to address matters relating to the 
financing of the development of nuclear and other such weaponry 
for destructive purposes."  Speaking on behalf of the BMA, 
William Kattan remarked, "The action taken by the Attorney 
General's office to restrict Bermuda based companies from 
conducting business with Iranian Bank Mellat and the IRISL is a 
clear demonstration of Bermuda's commitment to follow through on 
its new anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism financing 
framework.
