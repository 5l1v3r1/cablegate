Hadda.  Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) New Zealand agrees with the United States and believes 
Jose Angel Gurria to be the best candidate for Secretary 
General of the OECD.  While New Zealand also sees both 
candidates -- Gurria and Marek Belka -- as qualified, it 
considers Gurria as more capable.  Its preference for Gurria 
is merit-based and not politically motivated.  Post discussed
