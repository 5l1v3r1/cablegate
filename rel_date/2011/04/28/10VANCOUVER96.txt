SUBJECT: Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics: Situation Report #12 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The following report provides security-related 
information for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games as of noon 
on February 22, 2010. Please visit the following link for 
additional classified reporting: 
https://nol.nctc.sgov.gov/ng/cgi-bin/nctcHome .cgi?event=Vancouver_2 
¶010. The interagency USG Joint Operations Center can be contacted 
on a 24-hour basis at 604-692-2509, ext 4013. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U//FOUO//LES) Canadian and USG authorities are currently 
unaware of any specific, credible threats to the Games. Though the 
frequency of organized demonstrations has diminished since February 
15, ad hoc protest activity at event and public locations remains a 
concern. Canadian security officials indicate anti-Olympics groups 
may stage limited demonstrations as the Games draw to a close. 
 
 
 
SECURITY ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) U.S. Defeats Canada 5-3 in Group A Hockey; No Significant 
Incidents - Local law enforcement authorities had expressed concern 
over the potentially contentious nature of last night's U.S. - 
Canada match and its impact on public order. To mitigate the 
potential for alcohol-fueled incidents, Canada Hockey Place ceased 
alcohol sales early in the third period.  Additionally, the 
Vancouver Police Department enacted a 7 p.m. closing time for 
public and private liquor stores in the downtown area and increased 
the number of officers on duty.  Despite the presence of some 
200,000 people on the streets, the evening passed without 
significant incident. 
 
Protests: 
 
¶4.  (U) February 21 Protest Activity - No Olympics-related protests 
occurred February 21. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (U) Current Protest Activity - There are no Olympics-related 
protests scheduled for today, February 22. 
 
¶6.  (U) Anticipated Protest Activity - On February 24, activists 
plan to stage a "Share the Gold" human chain protest in the 
Downtown East Side from 4:45 - 5:15pm PST.  Demonstrators hope to 
form a chain of individuals for three blocks along either side of 
East Hastings Street, between Carrall Street and Gore Avenue.  The 
protest will likely be peaceful, but may cause minor traffic 
disruptions. 
 
¶7.  (U) Bicyclists and skaters plan to participate in a "Critical 
Mass Bike Ride" departing from the Vancouver Art Gallery around 6 
p.m. on February 26. This recurring event is taking place as 
regularly scheduled and is not anti-Olympics in nature; however, 
the route is unknown and could affect the Men's Hockey Semi-Final 
game at 6:30 p.m. at Canada Hockey Place. Minor traffic disruptions 
are expected. 
 
 
 
¶8.  (U) A "Games Over! Resistance Lives!" demonstration is 
scheduled to occur from 1 to 3pm PST on February 28 at the 
intersection of Smithe and Cambie Streets. The event is advertised 
as a "noisy public festival to celebrate our communities and our 
resistance."  This demonstration is being touted on the militant 
activist website www.no2010.com. 
 
Incidents: 
 
 
 
¶9.  (U)  No Olympics-related security incidents occurred during 
this reporting period. 
 
 
 
Threats: 
 
 
 
¶10.  (SBU) At this time, there are no known specific, credible 
transnational terrorist threats against the Vancouver Olympics. 
 
 
 
SECURITY OPERATIONS 
 
 
 
¶11.  (SBU) Other than scheduled USOC and team movements, no major 
Olympics-related security operations have transpired during this 
reporting period. 
 
 
 
¶12.  (SBU) Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet 
Napolitano, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, 
and US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice will visit Vancouver from 
February 25 to March 1.  These VIPs are tentatively scheduled to 
attend various competition venues as well as the closing 
ceremonies. 
 
PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
 
 
¶13.  There is no significant information or activity to report. 
 
 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶14.   No significant cases to report. No problems after the 
US-Canada hockey game. 
 
POLITICAL/GENERAL ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶15.  In a surprising upset Sunday, the U.S. men's hockey team 
defeated Canada 5-3 and advanced to the quarterfinals on Wednesday 
against an unknown opponent.  Following the game, Vancouver was 
remarkably quiet Sunday night. 
 
 
 
¶16.  A record number of passengers are expected to depart Vancouver 
(YVR) Airport on March 1, the day after the Closing Ceremonies. 
Crowds anticipated to be as large as 39,000, surpassing the 
previous one day high of 26,000, have led airport officials to 
advise travelers to arrive at the airport up to 4 hours before 
their flight. 
 
¶17.   Unseasonably warm weather conditions continue in the 
Vancouver area.   A schedule and results of all competitions 
throughout the Games can be found at
