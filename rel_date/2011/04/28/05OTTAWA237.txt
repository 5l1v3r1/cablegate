CONSTRUCTION ENGINEER WITH CANADIAN COMPANY. 
 
PLEASE CHECK HIS PAST: 
HE WAS IN BAGHDAD 
HE WAS IN TRIPOLI 
HE WAS MIDDLE-ASIAN COUNTRIES. 
THERE HE ESTABLISHED HIS CONNECTIONS FOR HIS ILLEGAL 
ACTIVITIES: 
TRAFFICKING AND TERRORISM. 
 
HE WAS PURSUED BY POLICE, AND VERY CLOSE TO BE IDENTIFIED, HE 
FLED TO CANADA. 
 
HE WAS BACK TO ISTANBUL RECENTLY AND HAD MEETING WITH A 
TERRORIST GROUP UNDER HIS AUTHORITY. 
 
HE ORDERED BEHEAD AMERICAN HOSTAGES TO BE INFLUENTIAL AGAINST 
USA. 
 
THIS IS BEGINNING OF VIOLENCE. 
 
IN CASE YOU CAN MANAGE TO MAKE HIM TALK, YOU'LL ILLUMINATE 
SOME DARK CORNERS OF TERRORISM IN IRAQ.  CONSEQUENTLY, YOU'LL 
SAVE THE LIVES OF MANY INNOCENT AMERICANS.  BECAUSE HE IS IN 
PREPARATION OF NEW EVILS AGAINST USA.
