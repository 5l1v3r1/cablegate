NOMINATING-OFFICER: Field Rep Betty Rice 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Although the Fraser Institute is based in western Canada and 
has been around for more than 30 years, the Calgary office 
is only a few years old.  The Calgary office contains the 
Alberta Policy Research Institute, which examines topics 
such as the military, aboriginal leadership, 
environmentalism, and governance. In its first years, the 
Calgary office has made itself known through a variety of 
means-most notably through a speaker series involving high- 
level local businesspeople engaged in discussion with 
international leaders (including, most recently, Ambassador 
Cellucci).  Barry McNamar is responsible for the 
organization of these meetings, and has done an excellent 
job.   He shows a strong interest in the United States and 
is at a point in his career where an individual program 
would encourage him to look even further into economic 
issues in the U.S.   His participation in a group EU 
Regional Project on Trade and Economic Issues would expand 
his understanding of U.S. trade and economic policies and 
likely translate into higher quality dialogue via the Fraser 
Institute on economic matters that impact both Canada and 
the United States.
