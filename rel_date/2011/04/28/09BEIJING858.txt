Computer Spying Allegations 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  China "resolutely opposes the damaging of computer networks 
including through hacking," said spokesperson Qin Gang at the March 
31 regular MFA press conference.  Some outside China are "bent on 
making fabrications."  Switching to English, Qin said that there is 
a "cold war ghost" and a "cold war virus" outside of China that 
"attempt to tarnish China with lies."  These lies are "doomed to 
fail."  Asked whether China would investigate the reports of 
hacking, Qin said that he thought it was time to "track down" those 
who spread the "cold war virus." 
 
North Korea 
----------- 
 
¶3. Asked about reported North Korean rocket launch preparations, Qin 
said that "relevant parties should stay calm, exercise restraint and 
do more to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in 
East Asia."  China is "paying close attention" to the issue and will 
"stay in close contact" with relevant countries to promote the 
Six-Party Talks, said Qin. Asked about the 60th anniversary of 
relations between China and North Korea, Qin said that celebrations 
are aimed at "increasing mutual understanding."  China and North 
Korea have a tradition of high-level exchanges and both countries 
will need to reach a decision regarding a potential visit of Prime 
Minister Wen Jiabao. 
 
Afghanistan 
----------- 
 
¶4.  Afghanistan is "at a cross-roads" and the international 
community should "take measures to promote reconstruction," said 
Qin.  At The Hague, Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei will explain 
China's policy toward Afghanistan and "call on the international 
community to take action."  China and Afghanistan are friendly 
neighbors and China will assist Afghanistan "within China's 
capacity."  Asked what resources China would seek in Afghanistan, 
Qin said "Afghanistan's stability is the biggest resource." 
 
Tibet 
----- 
 
¶5. The "local government will decide" if Tibet is open to 
foreigners, said Qin.  Foreigners who would like to go to Tibet 
should apply with the local government.  Asked about the role of the 
Chinese government-supported Panchen Lama, Qin said that he is "a 
religious leader who loves the motherland."  China "hopes he will 
contribute to the development of Tibet and play a role in 
maintaining the territorial integrity of the motherland."  Regarding 
the Dalai Lama, Qin accused the "Dalai Clique" of "always lying and 
twisting facts." 
 
Internet Censorship 
------------------- 
 
¶6. "What you can see you can see and what you cannot see you cannot 
see" said Qin when asked about continued censorship of Internet site 
YouTube.  China "administers the internet according to law," said 
Qin. 
 
Relations with India 
-------------------- 
 
¶7. Qin said he was "surprised to see" media reports that India's 
military views China as a threat.  Chinese and Indian leaders have 
"reached a consensus" that the two countries "do not pose a threat" 
to one another.  China and India are "partners" and China would like 
to "promote bilateral ties." 
 
Relations with Australia

------------------------ 
 
¶8. The Chinese government supports Chinese companies doing business 
with Australian companies "on the basis of mutual benefit," said 
Qin.   This cooperation will "also benefit Australia." 
 
Visit of Chavez to China 
------------------------ 
 
¶9. China "welcomes" Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez to visit China, 
but the spokesman did not have any information to announce. 
 
Relations with France 
--------------------- 
 
¶10. The "development" of China-France relations is "the common 
aspiration of both peoples," said Qin.  China hopes that France will 
respond to China's concerns in order to "bring relations back on 
track."  China and France should "join hands in the face of the 
financial crisis" added Qin. 
 
Travel/Visits 
------------- 
 
¶11. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao will attend the 12th China-ASEAN 
meeting, the 12th ASEAN, China, Korea and Japan meeting, the fourth
