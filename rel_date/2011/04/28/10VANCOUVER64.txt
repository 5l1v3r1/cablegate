1,000 people before police stopped it near BC Place, the site of

in the form smashing windows of retail stores, damaging cars, and 
throwing objects at police officers - are being received. Police 
escorts are accompanying several groups, and anti-riot police are 
stationed at key locations in downtown Vancouver. The Vancouver 
Police Department and Royal Canadian Mounted Police have made 
 
several arrests.

PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY 
 
 
 
¶8. The presence of Vice President Biden was mentioned several times 
during and after the Olympics' opening ceremony, and the Vice 
President was briefly shown on-screen during the march-in of Team 
USA on CTV.  Prior to the opening ceremony, the VP's meet and greet 
with Team USA athletes was covered by Getty, NBC and Associated 
Press journalists, which post's public affairs staff worked to get 
into the event. 
 
 
 
 
 
CONSULAR ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶9. There is no significant information or activity to report. 
 
 
 
POLITICAL/GENERAL ISSUES 
 
 
 
¶10. The Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics officially opened with a 3 
hour celebration at BC Place.  During a dramatic display of lights 
and music, athletes from around the world were greeted by tens of 
thousands of energetic spectators, as well as international 
 
leaders, and celebrities. The elaborate ceremonies placed a special 
emphasis on the diversity of Canadian cultural history, especially 
aboriginal. 
 
 
 
¶11. Post Political/Economic Officer Beau Fancher observed 
anti-Olympic protests in downtown Vancouver immediately prior to 
Friday's Opening Ceremonies.  An estimated 1,000 protesters, many 
carrying banners and yelling slogans of various causes from 
pro-environment, pro-aboriginal, to anti-capitalist, protested the 
Opening Ceremonies. The march was met by massed police lines in a 
sometimes tense, but otherwise peaceful demonstration.  The 
protesters were contained and unable to seriously impede access to 
the Ceremonies.  The protest was centered at the meeting point of a 
main entrance to the Ceremonies and the provincial representative 
Alberta House.  Many of the protesters carried signs and banners 
critical of the controversial development of Alberta oil reserves, 
known as "tar-sands." A senior representative from the BC Civil 
Liberties Association, a group that has been highly critical of 
Vancouver Police Department's (VPD) planned handling of potential 
protests, expressed praise for VPD's "measured" response to the 
protesters at the Opening Ceremonies. 
 
 
 
¶12. Following arrival in Vancouver, Vice President Biden and rest 
of the Presidential Delegation attended an afternoon USOC hosted US 
athletes' pep rally. The Vice President addressed approximately70 
US athletes, wishing them well in their upcoming competitions and 
taking the opportunity to speak with each team individually while 
taking team photos.  The Vice President and Dr. Biden then attended 
the GOC hosted Heads of Delegation reception before proceeding to 
the Opening Ceremonies. Vice President Biden and the rest of the 
Presidential Delegation attended the Opening Ceremonies and stayed 
through the entirety of the festivities. Competitions begin this 
 
morning with the first medals awarded in the final round of men's 
ski jumping.  A schedule and results of all competitions throughout 
the Games can be found at
