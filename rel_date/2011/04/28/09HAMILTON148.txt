¶1.      (U)  As of December 12, the Government of Bermuda (GOB) 
has reported four new confirmed cases of H1N1 on the Island in 
December, bringing the total number of laboratory-confirmed 
cases to 23 from 19 on November 28 (REFTEL A).  Of those, 21 
were residents and 2 were visitors.  According to the Department 
of Health's website, there are slightly more cases among males 
than females, and the majority of cases are aged 25-44 (nine 
cases aged 25-44, 6 cases aged 5-14, and five cases aged 45-64, 
10 females and 13 males).  There have been no confirmed deaths 
on the Island attributed to the virus. 
 
 
 
¶2.       (SBU)  Minister of Health Walter Roban told the Consul 
General on December 16 that he expected an initial shipment of 
5000-6000 doses of H1N1 vaccine later this week.  The GOB plans 
to distribute these doses to essential workers and other high 
risk groups.  He noted that the UK, the source of Bermuda's 
vaccine, had assured the GOB that Bermuda could have easy access 
to more doses.  He added that when Bermuda reduced its initial 
order of doses, the UK was able to ship doses more quickly. 
Roban observed that Bermuda has had fewer cases by this time of 
the year than had been expected.
