SUBJECT: DEMARCHE ON MANAS AIRFIELD 
 
REF: SECSTATE 81543 
 
Classified By: DCM DAVID R. BURNETT, 
FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1.  (C) On May 23, Pol-Econ Counselor and DATT shared reftel 
demarche with Chris Seed, Deputy Secretary of Defence.  PE 
Couns also separately conveyed the demarche to Matthew 
Paterson, Policy Officer in the Security Policy Division at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT). 
 
¶2.  (C) On May 25, Paterson told PE Couns that as an 
originating member, New Zealand continues to take OEF very 
seriously.  GNZ also remains grateful to the United States 
for the logistical support it has provided for New Zealand's 
participation, as well as for the potential air cover and 
evacuation support that NZ fortunately has not needed to 
date.  For this reason, New Zealand would be happy to support 
our request. 
 
¶3.  (C) New Zealand has no diplomatic mission in Kyrgystan, 
which is covered out of NZ's Embassy in Moscow.  The new NZ 
Ambassador to Russia, Christopher Elder, has not yet 
presented his credentials to the Kyrgyz Government, and MFAT 
is considering combining the presentation (which has not yet 
been arranged) with the request on our behalf regarding Manas 
Airfield.  Paterson also said MFAT believes that as NZDF had 
deployed a C-130 at Manas during the initial stages of OEF, 
New Zealand still has useful contacts there.  Peterson 
cautioned that no matter what strategy MFAT ultimately 
pursues, GNZ has found it can take a while to arrange 
meetings with Kyrgyz officials, as New Zealand has few 
significant interests in Kyrgystan.  He promised to keep PE 
Couns advised as to GNZ's progress.
