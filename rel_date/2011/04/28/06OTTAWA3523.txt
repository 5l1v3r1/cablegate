SUBJECT: CANADIAN TYPHOON ASSISTANCE TO THE PHILIPPINES 
 
 
(U)  On November 1, Foreign Minister MacKay and International 
Cooperation Minister Verner expressed Canada's condolences to 
the families and communities in the central and northern 
Philippines affected by Typhoon Durian.  Minister Verner 
announced that Canada is immediately allocating C$1 million 
to support the efforts of Philippine and international 
agencies providing emergency assistance to the affected 
areas, and to assist with early recovery and disaster 
preparedness initiatives.  The Canadian aid includes 
C$500,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross to 
assist with emergency and temporary shelter, non-food items, 
water, and sanitation.  Another C$500,000 will be allocated 
to the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives to support local 
organizations in facilitating the recovery of affected 
households and addressing future disaster preparedness needs. 
 The GoC provided C$550,000 earlier in November to assist 
with relief and recovery efforts after Typhoon Xangsane and 
C$300,000 in February 2006 after mudslides in southern Leyte.
