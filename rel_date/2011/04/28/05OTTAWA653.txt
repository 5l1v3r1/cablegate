SUBJECT: CANADA: RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON CSW WOMEN'S 
ECONOMIC ADVANCEMENT RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 030251 
 
¶1.  (U)  Poloff delivered the demarche (per reftel) 
concerning a U.S. draft resolution, Economic Advancement of 
Women, to be presented at the 49th session of the Commission 
on the Status of Women (CSW), to Chantale Walker, Policy 
Advisor in the International Women's Equality Division at 
Foreign Affairs Canada (FAC), on February 23.  Walker thanked 
us for the demarche points and the opportunity to review the 
draft resolution, stating that she would coordinate with her 
colleagues at FAC, including Nell Stewart, Senior Advisor in 
the Women's Equality Division, who is representing FAC at the 
CSW. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Walker provided the following comment on the draft 
resolution to poloff via e-mail received March 1: 
 
(Quote) Although this draft resolution covers some education 
and poverty elements, it does so in a selective rather than 
holistic manner, and therefore, the resolution is very 
market-oriented and entrepreneurship-focused.  We would 
encourage this draft to be more comprehensive and in so 
doing, inclusive of the various elements of the "Women and 
the economy" objective of the Beijing PFA, so that issues 
such as social security, unpaid work, employment or pay 
equity, and work/family balance are included.  We have 
attempted to work with the current text and have made 
suggested changes in the attached draft to address these 
concerns.  (Unquote) 
 
¶3.  (U) The attached draft referred to in the statement above 
has been forwarded by poloff to IO/EDA (Janet Shannon/Deborah 
Linde) via e-mail on March 1.
