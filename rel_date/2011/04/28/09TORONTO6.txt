SUBJECT: Ontario Union Call For Ban on Israeli Professors; Canadian 
Jewish Congress Immediately Responds. 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) in 
Ontario announced on January 6 that it would propose a ban on 
Israeli academics speaking, teaching, or researching at Ontario 
universities.  The proposal is in response to the December 29 
Israeli bombing that damaged the Islamic University in Gaza. 
Canadian Jewish groups immediately condemned the resolution for 
being unfair and unbalanced.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) CUPE, the province's largest university workers union, 
announced that its University Workers Coordinating Committee will 
try to prohibit Israeli academics from speaking, teaching, or 
researching at Ontario universities.  CUPE Ontario President Sid 
Ryan proclaimed that Israeli academics should not be working in 
Ontario universities unless they explicitly condemn the bombing of 
the Islamic University in Gaza and the assault on Gaza in general. 
The resolution is still being drafted for consideration at the 
Committee's annual meeting on February 19.  If it passes the 
Committee, it would be on the agenda at CUPE Ontario's conference in 
May.  Should it pass that point, the union would then ask the 
province's schools to respect the prohibition. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Canadian Jewish groups such as the Canadian Jewish Congress 
(CJC) and Hillel student organizations immediately condemned the 
proposal.  The Ontario branch of the CJC called the resolution 
"unbalanced, unfair, and unhelpful."  A well-known non-Jewish human 
rights activist who has worked with many ethnic groups told us 
privately that he also considered the resolution to be ridiculous 
and unfair.  If one is going to oppose blaming all Palestinians 
collectively for the actions of Hamas, he said, one must also oppose 
blaming all Israeli academics for the actions of their government. 
He doubted that the resolution would go anywhere. 
 
¶4. (U) Comment: The proposed ban on Israeli academics is the latest 
in recent events showing how the Israeli offensive in Gaza has 
raised emotions in Toronto - Canada's most diverse city and home 
both to Canada's largest Muslim community and also its largest and 
most influential Jewish community.  In the last two weeks, two 
demonstrations against Israel's actions have been held in Toronto 
with protestors marching from the Israeli Consulate to the U.S. 
Consulate.  The most recent protest, on January 3, saw as many as 
3,000 demonstrators gather peaceably in front of our Consulate.  The 
Jewish community, meanwhile, also is organizing events here to 
demonstrate support of Israel.  The resolution itself seems likely 
to be dropped as a bad idea (and it likely would be OBE before it 
comes to a vote in any case), but vocal and biased comments and more 
Toronto demonstrations can be expected throughout the operation. 
End Comment.
