¶1.  The Mission Canada IPR Working Group is pleased to 
announce that the Canada IPR Toolkit is now available on 
Embassy Ottawa,s general website, in response to Ref A.  The 
toolkit is designed to assist smaller businesses in locating 
the information necessary to protect their IP in Canada.  As 
noted in Ref B, the toolkit is more streamlined than the 
China or Russia versions.  Because Canada has clear laws and 
a reliable judicial system relatively easy for U.S. 
businesses to navigate, the toolkit acts as a straightforward 
link-based guide that directs the user to a number of GOC 
websites specifically addressing IPR issues.  The toolkit 
also points the user to a number of U.S. and international 
IPR sources. 
 
¶2.  The toolkit may be accessed by clicking on the

Ottawa homepage, canada.usembassy.gov/content/index.asp
