ESTH Counselor passed information contained in reftels to 
Health Canada and Foreign Affairs Canada (FAC).  According to 
FAC, Ian Shugart, Senior Asst. Deputy Minister in Health 
Canada and Michael Small, Director General for Global Issues 
in FAC will represent Canada at the Senior Officials Meeting 
in Washington next week.  ESTH Counselor raised with Health 
Canada and FAC the question of whether a representative of 
Agriculture Canada should be included in the delegation. 
Officials indicated that they would consider the question and 
get back to us if there is to be any change in the 
composition of the delegation. We are still waiting to hear 
from the GOC whether Canada will join in the joint statement 
we provided to them last week and whether their 
representative will agree to participate in a panel 
discussion October 7 on response and containment.
