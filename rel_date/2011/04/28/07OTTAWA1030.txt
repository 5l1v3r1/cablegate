SUBJECT: CANADIAN AGREEMENT ON IMPORTANCE OF INTL SUPPORT 
FOR UNSCR 1267 
 
REF: STATE 65371 
 
¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered points in reftel to Yves Beaulieu, 
Deputy Director of the Department of Foreign Affairs' 
(DFAIT's) International Crime and Terrorism Division, and 
Georges Flanagan Whalen, Policy Advisor in the same division. 
 Whalen said Canada had attended the May 22 UN briefing on 
efforts to combat terrorism.  Beaulieu explained that he 
believes there is a difference in attitude towards the 1267 
regime between donor countries and receiver countries.  He 
said the developing world still does not see how the 1267 
regime helps them, and therefore, is not inclined to actively 
participate in the process. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Whalen said that if information about the USG's 
position on Ahmed Idriss Nasreddin's delisting request 
becomes available, he would be interested in learning about 
our position.
