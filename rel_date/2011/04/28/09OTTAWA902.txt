¶1. (SBU) On November 20, Econoff delivered reftel points to 
Christine Phillips, Senior Desk Officer for Bosnia & Herzegovina, 
Serbia, and Kosovo, Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade.  Phillips was unaware of Serbia's proposed Annex, but is 
concerned about Serbia's activities within the ITU, as described in 
reftel.  She will urge Canada's ITU delegation to oppose the 
Serbian proposal and expects that they will do so. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Phillips explained that while she was unaware of Serbia's 
activity within the ITU, it comes as no surprise.  She noted that 
Serbia has on several recent occasions attempted to marginalize 
Kosovo through "obscure and technical UN bodies, such as UNESCO." 
Phillips commented that because Serbia buries these activities in 
seemingly minor technical proposals, they are often hard to detect.
