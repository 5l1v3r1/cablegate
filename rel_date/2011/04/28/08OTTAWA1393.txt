SUBJECT: CANADA WELCOMES U.S. - CARIBBEAN SECURITY 
DIALOGUE, WANTS TO PARTICIPATE 
 
REF: STATE 114232 
 
¶1.  (U) Action request - please see para 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In response to reftel demarche, Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) Deputy 
Director for Defence and Security Relations Michael Kaduck 
told pol/miloff on October 29 that Canada is keen to 
participate in the U.S. - Caribbean Security Dialogue. 
Officials from both DFAIT and Public Safety Canada will 
attend the event, he said.  The Dialogue complements the 
Conservative government's desire to intensify security 
engagement in the Americas, and to partner with like-minded 
states in bolstering Caribbean and Central American 
governance and security, according to Kaduck. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Kaduck commented that Canada welcomed greater U.S. 
attention to the Caribbean after seven years of 
"understandable and appropriate" focus on major challenges in 
South Asia and the Middle East.  He added that sustained U.S. 
engagement in the Caribbean will provide opportunities for 
willing but less capable partners like Canada to leverage 
their contributions to greater effect.  Kaduck asked whether 
the U.S. envisions Canadian (and European) assistant 
secretary-equivalents attending the Dialogue.  If so, he 
observed, they would want to bring staff. 
 
¶4.  (U) Action request: please clarify desired level and size 
of Canadian representation at the Dialogue.
