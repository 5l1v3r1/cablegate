SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND DEMARCHE RESPONSE - SUPPORTING NGO INVOLVEMENT 
AT THE UNITED NATIONS - ECOSOC 
 
REF: 09 STATE 68551; STATE 050902 
 
In response to reftel, Post contacted officials at New Zealand's 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade - United Nations, Human 
Rights and Commonwealth Division for comment on their position 
regarding the upcoming votes to accredit the Democracy Coalition 
Project (DCP) as an Non-Governmental Organization the United 
Nations Economic and Social Council, and to reconsider Dynamic 
Christian World Mission Foundation (DCWMF) at EcoSoc's Committee on 
NGOs. Officials at the division considered our request, and Post 
followed up by contacting Tom Kennedy, at that division, for a 
response. Kennedy noted that they had considered the position 
outlined in the demarche, and were inclined to stand with the U.S. 
on this issue when the vote is called at the UN, but a definitive 
response would be forthcoming as soon as they complete 
consultations with their PermReps at UN.
