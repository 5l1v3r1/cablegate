DEMARCHE DELIVERED 
 
REF: STATE 15012 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Emboff delivered reftel demarche to Singapore 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
Representative Bong Kim Pin on February 10, following a 
personal representation by Singapore-based FAA Asia Pacific 
Director Nancy Graham to Civil Aviation Authority of 
Singapore Deputy Director General Chiang Hai Eng.  Post has 
also raised this matter with the Ministries of Transport and 
Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Representative Bong frankly told us that, while 
Singapore favors Bill Voss for ICAO Secretary General, they 
will be unable to support him openly; Bong offered no firm 
commitment on Singapore's final vote. He said he believes 
that Voss has the backing of the "non-biased" members of 
ICAO, but added that this election is likely to be highly 
politicized.  He noted that any winning candidate might find 
it difficult to move forward an ICAO divided along regional 
lines, though many ICAO members think Voss is the nominee 
most capable of doing so. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Per Reftel, Bong confirmed that he has a strong 
relationship with the South African ICAO delegation and that 
the South Africans have some influence over other nations in 
that region.  When asked, he offered to share the talking 
points with the South Africans but cautioned that Singapore 
must weigh its election decision against the long-term 
consequences supporting the U.S. candidate could have on its 
interactions with other ICAO members.  Bong also opined that 
the U.S. practice of paying ICAO dues off schedule could hurt 
Voss's candidacy.
