SUBJECT: CANADA AGREES TO JOINT DEMARCHE RE UN SENIOR 
CIVILIAN REPRESENTATIVE FOR AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: STATE 1001 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel demarche on January 4, 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) 
Afghanistan Task Force (FTAG) Deputy Director Richard 
Arbeiter confirmed that DFAIT would instruct the Canadian 
Permanent Representative to the UN in New York to participate 
in the joint demarche urging Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon to 
appoint Lord Ashdown as Senior Civilian Representative (SCR) 
for Afghanistan. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Arbeiter explained that Canada fully recognizes the 
need to choose a European SCR, particularly in light of the 
shared desire eventually to "triple-hat" Lord Ashdown.  He 
added, however, that Canada would like to see the SCR's terms 
of reference (TORs) specifically cite Canada as "a source of 
advice and support." Arbeiter added that Canada will do 
everything it can to help ensure that the SCR's inaugural 
trip to Afghanistan -- which he predicted would occur in late 
January -- is a success.  To this end, Canada wants to work 
with the U.S. and other partners to deal with any possible 
sensitivities in Afghanistan arising from the creation of the 
SCR position, and to make sure Lord Ashdown appreciates the 
need to consult with as many Afghan interlocutors as 
possible.  He underscored that "it's critical that he get it 
right from the outset." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Arbeiter commented that the UNAMA annual review 
would occur in March and therefore it will be important for 
the U.S. and Canada to collaborate closely on setting the 
stage for the SCR to succeed.  This will include ensuring 
Lord Ashdown has the power commensurate with the demands upon 
him and drafting a strong resolution regarding UNAMA that 
would translate into SCR authority over relevant UN budgets, 
he noted. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Arbeiter said that he plans to discuss these and 
other matters when he and colleagues from FTAG meet with 
working-level counterparts in Washington, D.C. o/a January 
¶15.  He added that his team very much hopes that this meeting 
will focus on dialogue rather than on set-piece presentations.
