RIGHTS DECLARATION 
 
REF: STATE 145292 
 
¶1. (SBU) According to Paul Gibbard, Director of the Office of 
Aboriginal and Circumpolar Affairs at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Canada shares our 
views that the OAS Declaration is ill-conceived and is headed 
for a "train-wreck."  Gibbard said that Canada had a number 
of concerns with the UN text, and that the OAS resolution 
proposes even larger commitments.  Canada sees the 
negotiations process as requiring a considerable amount of 
work, but does not anticipate an eventual consensus, which 
will be very negative for the OAS as an institution. The GOC 
will suggest to OAS member states that, as the process is not 
likely to yield a successful outcome, the best approach would 
be to back up from the negotiations and look instead closely 
at the underlying issues, seeking areas where there may be 
consensus. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Gibbard added that the GOC will be supportive of our 
proposed "year of action" in principle, but expressed concern 
that it could lead to commitments that Canada would prefer to 
avoid.  He said that Working Group Chairman Cuadros had been 
pushing for a two-track process in which the U.S. and Canada 
would fund projects instead of participating in negotiations. 
 He expressed concern that our proposal could also go in this 
direction but insisted that the GOC would not be in a 
position to provide funding unless the OAS makes a clear 
statement that indigenous rights and issues are a key 
priority.  Gibbard nonetheless promised to consult internally 
on our proposal and get back to us.  In general, he said, 
Canada sees the potential to work together -- as long as 
there are no direct fiscal implications.
