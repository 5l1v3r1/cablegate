SUBJECT: CANADIAN RESPONSE:  SEEKING CO-COMPLAINANTS FOR 
POSSIBLE WTO DISPUTE ON CHINA IPR 
 
REF: STATE 126686 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  This is an action message: see paragraphs 3 and 4. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On August 9, EconMinCouns and Econoff met with 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) 
Intellectual Property Director Doug George to discuss reftel 
and other IPR issues (septel).  George said he was thoroughly 
briefed on the possible WTO dispute with China during a 
recent trip to Washington, DC.  The GOC has not yet decided 
whether to join with the USG in a potential WTO case, 
partially because the GOC has not finalized its internal 
consultations.  George plans to be in Toronto on August 11 to 
consult with Canadian IPR stakeholders with interests in 
China.  The GOC's decision on whether to join with the USG 
will be based on this stakeholder input, as well as legal 
analysis (whether Canada has been injured.)  Canada's 
political China strategy and focus on China as a trading 
partner will also factor into the GOC decision on whether to 
join the United States (and possibly other countries) in 
filing a WTO complaint. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  George asked whether the USG is only considering a 
copyright case, what the timing of the case is, when it would 
be certain that the USG will go ahead with the case, and what 
response the USG has been receiving from other potential 
co-complainants.  Post would appreciate guidance on how to 
answer these questions. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Mr. George also suggested that, if a high-level 
call on this question is planned (for example, between 
Ambassador Susan Schwab and International Trade Minister 
David Emerson), DFAIT should be given advance notice so that 
the Minister and his staff could be fully briefed.  He 
emphasized that without this advance notice, the call would 
not be as productive for the USG as it could be.
