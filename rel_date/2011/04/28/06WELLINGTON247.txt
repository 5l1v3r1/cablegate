SUBJECT: PETERS PROVIDES GNZ PERSPECTIVES ON THE PACIFIC 
 
 
¶1. (U) In a March 28 speech, Foreign Minister Winston Peters 
outlined GNZ objectives in the Pacific.  Delivered to a group 
of more than 200 diplomats, bureaucrats, academics, scholars 
and former politicos, Peters' speech provided a 
country-by-country review of GNZ strategies for the region. 
 
¶2.  (U) Among other things, Peters said GNZ will work with 
Fiji to support the country's democratic processes. It will 
also remain committed to its involvement in the Regional 
Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI).  In Papua New 
Guinea, GNZ will advance a mentoring program for heads of 
government departments.  In Vanuatu, GNZ will provide support 
to the Lini Government's good governance objectives.  GNZ 
will also promote increased trade integration of the French 
territories.  To implement these strategies, GNZ is likely to 
modestly increase its funding of aid to the region. 
 
¶3. (U) Peters also mentioned the recent visit of EAP A/S 
Hill, saying, "It was pleasing that during the recent visit 
of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Chris Hill, he expressed 
the view that not only did the U.S. appreciate what we were 
doing in the Pacific, but there was further work which we 
could do together, and this should be one of the building 
blocks for our relationship into the future."
