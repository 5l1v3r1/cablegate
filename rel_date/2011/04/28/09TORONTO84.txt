¶1. On April 23, 50-75 demonstrators gathered outside of the U.S. 
Consulate to call on the U.S. government to intervene on behalf of 
Tamils in Sri Lanka.  Although it was a small gathering, it was the 
fifth held in front of the Consulate since January. 
 
¶2.  Just as the demonstration began, Sri Lanka's Consul General in 
Toronto, who we know well, phoned to inform PolOff that the event 
had been organized by the World Tamil Movement (WTM), which was 
banned by the Canadian government as a terrorist organization in 
¶2006.  While we cannot confirm that the protestors were organized by 
the WTM, this is at least the third demonstration in which the red 
tiger flag - associated with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE) - has been flown by demonstrators outside the Consulate, 
along with Canadian and American flags.  The red Tiger flag also has 
been prominent in many of the other dozens of protests around the 
Toronto area, including recent protests that continued for several 
days at Queen's Park.
