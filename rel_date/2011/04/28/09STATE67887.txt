SUBJECT: ACTION REQUEST: IRANIAN PRESIDENT'S AU ATTENDANCE 
 
¶1.  (U) This action request is directed to all posts sending 
delegations to the July 1-3 African Union Summit in Tripoli. 
See para 3 for instructions. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Background: The Department has learned that Iranian 
president Mahmoud Ahmedi-Nejad (AN) will attend the July 1-3 
AU Summit in Tripoli. According to the UK embassy in 
Washington, AN is expected to have a speaking role during one 
of the plenary sessions.  During this 
session, we should expect AN to deploy his usual anti-Israeli 
rhetoric including his standard denial of the holocaust 
and/or his less frequent call for the destruction of Israel. 
We should also stand ready for him to allege US and other 
Western meddling in Iranian internal affairs including in the 
recent presidential elections.  With this expectation, we - 
in coordination with our European allies - should demonstrate 
our unified stance that AN's use of international fora to 
propagate untruths and issue threats is unacceptable. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Action Request:  Heads of the USG delegation and 
other senior USG officials attending the African Union Summit 
should not be present at any sessions where AN has a speaking 
role. Most other lower-level USG officials should plan to be 
absent during these sessions, with the exception of a 
notetaker.  USG officials may attend sessions where Iranian 
officials are expected to attend but not have a speaking 
role.  Should, however, Iranian officials in such settings 
speak out against Israel and Western meddling in Iranian 
internal affairs,  US 
officials of all ranks should walk out.  USG delegation and 
posts should coordinate actions with EU member states 
and like-minded delegations. 
 
¶4. (U) Tripoli minimize consider. 
 
END INSTRUCTIONS.
