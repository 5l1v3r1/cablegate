¶1.  Per reftel, Poloff delivered demarche to Mr. Tom Kennedy, 
Policy Officer, United Nation and Human Rights and 
Commonwealth Division (UNHC) in New Zealand's Ministry of 
Foreign Affaris and Trade (MFAT).  Biographic information on 
Ms. Myers and background information were also delivered. 
 
¶2.  Mr. Kennedy stated that the government of New Zealand 
will give Ms. Myers their full consideration but it is 
unlikely that any decision will be taken until closer to the 
time of election.  Mr. Kenndey will keep us informed should 
any additional information be required or in case GNZ is 
close to making a decision.
