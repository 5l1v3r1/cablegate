SUBJECT: TFHA01: CANADA CONSIDERING MEDEVACS 
 
¶1.  (U)  Canada is in the process of establishing procedures to 
treat medevac patients from Haiti.  A British Columbia-based NGO -- 
the Rick Hansen Foundation (which specializes in spinal cord 
injuries) -- has identified eight Haitian patients with spiral cord 
injuries recommended by contacts on the ground in Haiti (including 
at least one Canadian Forces doctor).  It has offered to pay their 
medical expenses in Canada for ninety days.  The Department of 
National Defence has apparently agreed to provide a medevac airlift 
from Haiti to the Ottawa area.  Four hospitals in Ontario and one 
in Manitoba have tentatively agreed to provided the needed care. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U)  However, the government of Canada is still wrestling with 
a few issues: 
 
--  how to issue visas to the eight patients, most of whom 
presumably do not have passports now and few of whom would likely 
qualify for a visa ordinarily; 
 
--  how to pay for in-country Canadian travel; 
 
--  eligibility of family members to accompany, and who would cover 
those costs; 
 
--  who would absorb the costs of any medical treatment or 
rehabilitation after the 90 day period; 
 
--  how to ensure that the patients (and any family members) would 
return to Haiti, especially if Canada was still in its current 
period of halting all deportations to Haiti; 
 
--  how to deal with local perceptions of "queue jumping" in 
hospitals where there may be wait periods for Canadian patients 
with similar injuries; 
 
--  how to coordinate with the provincial health ministries, which 
individually administer the federally funded national health care 
system; 
 
--  how to determine whether alternative in-country hospital space 
may already be available in Haiti, as the Pan-American Health 
Organization has apparently suggested; and, 
 
-- which federal agency in the Canadian government should have the 
overall lead on this issue (most likely, the Privy Council Office). 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U)  There will be a meeting of Deputy Ministers late afternoon 
on February 5 to sort through some of these issues, with hopes of 
achieving greater clarity soon.   According to the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Canada wants to be 
supportive of this medevac process and intends to begin with this 
offer from the Rick Hansen Foundation and these eight cases, but 
will need some additional time given that there are no precedents 
in Canada for similar medevacs. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U)  Canada would welcome additional information about which 
other countries are currently providing or are planning to provide 
medevacs for Haitian patients and about the procedures that they - 
including the U.S. - are using regarding visas, expenses, etc. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (U)  Minimize concerned.
