(sbu) Canada is still considering the "focus and the scale" 
of its pledge at the Paris Support Conference for Afghanistan 
in June, according to Richard Arbeiter, the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade's Acting Director for 
Policy and Advocacy on the Afghanistan Task Force.  In 
responding to Ref A points on May 7, he also reaffirmed that 
Foreign Minister Maxime Bernier will likely lead the Canadian 
delegation in Paris.  Arbeiter added that Canada had been 
receiving "conflicting messages" from France about whether 
the June meeting would be a "political" or "pledging" 
conference.  He said the first time that France had asked if 
Canada would be pledging funds was during a May 7 morning 
conference call that included Canadian, French, and USG 
officials.  Arbeiter also asked about rumors that President 
Bush might attend the Paris Conference and inquired into the 
scale of the expected U.S. pledge.  (Comment:  Septel 
reports, inter alia, that Canadian Internaitonal Development 
Agency (CIDA) Afghanistan Task Force Director Kevin Rex told 
DAS for Afghanistan Patrick Moon that Canada would highlight 
its previous $100 million pledging commitment for 2009 at the 
Paris Conference.  Rex also implied that Canada's actual 
contribution in 2009 would exceed $100 million, which would 
track with Canada's previous decisions to "plus up" its $100 
million commitments in each of the past two years ($270 
million in 2007 and $349 million in 2008.  End Comment)
