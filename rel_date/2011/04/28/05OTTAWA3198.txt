¶1.  The GOC is contemplating an additional pledge at Geneva 
but the amount is not yet confirmed.  They asked if post has 
information on the amount the US plans to announce.  The 
Canadian delegation to the October 26 conference in Geneva 
will be led by their Ambassador, Paul Meyers, or his 
alternate Terry Cormier. 
 
C$20 million and tents so far 
----------------------------- 
 
¶1.  On October 21 the GOC committed C$20 million to respond 
to the October 8, 2005 earthquake.  This was in addition to 
the initial C$300,000 announced in the 24-hours after the 
disaster.  (The total thus far approaches US$20 million.)  In 
response to a request from the GOP, Canada has sent 12,000 
winterized blankets (21 tonnes) by milair in two shipments. 
Canada is also providing C$5 million to deploy two 
helicopters through the UN, with C$700,000 in fuel and staff 
support. 
 
¶2. As with the tsunami, the GOC has offered to match all 
donations made by individual Canadians between October 8-26 
to registered Canadian charities and is expediting 
immigration on family reunification grounds for those with 
relatives in the affected area.  Following consultation with 
the GOP, Canada has an assessment team in Pakistan to 
determine how best to assist, and has deployed its Disaster 
Assistance Response Team. 
 
Shipment of Tents 
----------------- 
¶3.  As described refs C and D, the GOC has agreed to pay for 
shipment of 7,500 winterized tents acquired by a Canadian 
NGO.  The first tranche of 1,300 tents is expected to arrive 
in Pakistan today (October 25).  An additional 1,600 have 
left Canada for the U.S., awaiting a PIA flight.  There are 
4,000 tents in a Toronto warehouse still awaiting consignment 
and CIDA will provide with shipping information on those as 
soon as IDRF, the NGO arranging the donation, has confirmed 
the details.  We are told that IDRF is working to finalize 
commercial carrier transport for the remaining tents, with 
technical support provided by the Canadian Red Cross.
