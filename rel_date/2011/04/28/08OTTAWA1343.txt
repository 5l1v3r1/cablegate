(sbu) Canada plans to pledge C$3 million at the Georgia 
Donor's Conference in Brussels on October 22, Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) Southern 
Caucasus and Central Asia Desk Officer Nancy Clark told 
Econcouns.  Clark said Canada's delegation to Brussels would 
be led by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Helena Guergis and include DFAIT's 
Director General for Europe, Robert Hage.  Clark noted that 
Canada's pledge comes on top of the C$3 million that the 
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) announced in 
August that it was providing to Georgia via the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees (C$1 million), UNICEF (C$700,000), 
the World Food Programme (C$500,000), World Vision Canada 
(C$300,000), and the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(C$1 million).  Clark stated that Canada's additional C$3 
million would be distributed by DFAIT's Global Peace and 
Security Fund and would go toward "stabilization" efforts, 
such as a U.S.-Canada de-mining project (C$1.1 million) and 
policing (C$2.9 million).  Given the relatively small amount 
of Canada's pledge, Clark said, DFAIT wanted to find niches 
-- such as de-mining -- where even limited funds could make a 
difference.
