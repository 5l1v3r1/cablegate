SUBJECT: CANADA RESPONDS TO WORLD FOOD PROGRAM EMERGENCY 
APPEAL 
 
 
¶1. Summary: In response to an urgent appeal from the United 
Nations' World Food Program (WFP), Canada announced that it 
is allocating C$230 million in food aid programming, C$50 
million more than last year.  The package includes C$10 
million in food aid for Haiti.  Canada is also fully untying 
restrictions on food aid on where food can be purchased.  The 
contribution won praise from the WFP.  End summary. 
 
¶2.  On April 30, Minister of International Cooperation Oda 
announced that Canada will give C$230 million in support of 
food aid programming for 2008-2009, a C$50 million increase 
over last year.  This represents a 28% increase in Canada's 
food aid.  Canada has been the second largest donor to the 
WFP so far this year.  Oda said that "Canada is responding to 
the terrible impact that rising food prices are having on the 
world's most vulnerable people." 
 
¶3.  Through the Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA), Canada provides food aid primarily through the WFP 
and the Canadian Foodgrains Bank (CFGB), Canada's primary 
non-governmental food aid partner which helps provide 
development assistance and food aid (cash, grain, other 
agricultural commodities) to people in need on behalf of 15 
Canadian church-based agencies.  Canada's food aid commitment 
for 2008-2009 will be distributed during the year on specific 
needs assessments made by the WFP and the CFGB.  The C$230 
million contribution includes C$5 million to the CFGB for 
purchasing and distributing food to help those most in 
greatest need around the world.  In response to the current 
acute food shortage in Haiti, the package also contains a 
special C$10 million contribution to that country through the 
WFP that will provide food for over 350,000 Haitians, 
primarily pregnant women and children under five years old. 
 
¶4.  In addition, Canada is maximizing the effectiveness of 
its contribution by untying restrictions on food aid.  This 
will provide the WFP and the CFGB with flexibility to procure 
food commodities from all countries - especially developing 
countries.  By removing such restrictions, Canada will 
promote the growth of local and regional markets in 
developing countries.  "This generous contribution by Canada 
will help protect millions of children from severe 
malnutrition and hunger," said WFP Executive Director Josette 
Sheeran.
