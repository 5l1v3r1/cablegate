SUBJECT: GOVT TALKS UP US-NZ RELATIONS DURING ANNIVERSARY 
OF ANTI-NUCLEAR LEGISLATION 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) In observing the 20th anniversary of New 
Zealand's iconic anti-nuclear legislation, the Government 
chose not to dwell on past tensions with the U.S. In a 
testimony to how far the bilateral relationship has come 
in recent years and how the anti-nuclear issue has lost 
much of its political heat, NZ officials instead focused 
on New ZealandQs efforts to address the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. PM Clark was also prominently quoted in 
local media near the anniversary date as saying US-NZ 
ties are the strongest they've been in two decades. 
The New Zealand mediaQs response to the anniversary was 
equally low key. Despite some rumblings from the 
political fringes during the anniversary period, National 
and other mainstream Parties reiterated their support for 
the law's retention. End Summary. 
 
Anniversary marked without much fanfare 
--------------------- ------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) The 20th anniversary of the passing of the New 
Zealand Nuclear Weapon Free Zone, Disarmament and Arms 
Control Act, colloquially known as the anti-nuclear 
legislation, was marked by the current Labour Government 
in a low-key manner. Most of the original draftees and 
advocates of the anti-nuclear legislation remain in 
Parliament today, among them PM Helen Clark and 
Disarmament Minister Phil Goff, both junior MPs at the 
time of the passing of the Act. They choose to 
commemorate the anniversary with a small and informal 
gathering in the office of the Prime Minister. The New 
Zealand media also made relative light work of the 
anniversary and it passed without much analysis, 
commentary or opinion. 
 
Govt focuses on proliferation 
------------------------------ 
¶3. (SBU) During the anniversary period, the New Zealand 
Government spoke warmly of the current state of U.S. 
New Zealand relations. When asked by the media to sum up 
relations with the U.S. during a recent visit to 
Australia, Clark said that both countries had Qturned a 
cornerQ. She noted that New Zealand and the U.S. 
Qobviously had issues arising from the nuclear free 
policyQ and Qfor a long time it's been a rock in the road 
in the relationship between New Zealand and the States at 
the governmental level.Q  Yet, Clark observed that during 
her trip to Washington in March this year she believed 
that there was a mutual acknowledgement that Qa way could 
be seen around the rock in the road." 
¶4. (SBU) In reference to the anniversary, Goff issued a 
statement to Parliament that focused on New ZealandQs 
opposition to nuclear weapon proliferation and 
participation in efforts designed to prevent the spread 
of nuclear weapons. Goff said that the legislation is as 
relevant today as when it was passed into law because 
proliferation has grown as more countries have acquired 
nuclear weapons and terrorists seek to acquire them. 
Opposition pledges retention of anti-nuclear legislation 
------------------- ------------------------------------ 
¶5. (SBU) In a speech to Parliament, Murray McCully, the 
Foreign Affairs spokesman of the main Opposition National 
Party, voiced support for the anti-nuclear legislation. 
However, he also referred to the resulting effect the 
legislation has had on the bilateral relationship and 
called the continuing lack of a formal ally status with 
the U.S Qthe unfinished business of the nuclear free 
debate.Q In endorsing the legislation, McCully pledge to 
work with the Government to improve New ZealandQs 
relationship with the U.S which, he pointedly noted, 
includes achieving a Free Trade Agreement. (Note. In the 
past National did not easily embrace the anti-nuclear 
legislation because of the adverse effect it had on the 
New ZealandQs security arrangements. Until recently it 
was unclear whether the National Party would retain the 
legislation if in government. However, when John Key 
became party leader in 2006 he moved quickly to make it 
known that a National Government under his leadership 
would retain the anti-nuclear legislation. End Note).

Murmurings from the fringes 
--------------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) Although the anniversary of the Act generally 
received broad based political support it did not pass 
without comment and critique from a couple of the minor 
parties. The right-wing ACT Party suggested that the 
legislation was outdated and that by retaining it New 
Zealand is allowing relations with its traditional allies 
to deteriorate. The Left-wing Green Party took the 
opportunity to accuse the Government of hypocrisy for 
allowing the New Zealand Super Fund - a retirement 
investment fund established by the Labour Government in 
2001 that accumulates and invests Government 
contributions Q to invest in firms making nuclear weapons 
technology, such as Northrop Grumman Corp. 
¶7. Comment: (SBU) The anti-nuclear legislation remains 
firmly embedded in New ZealandQs national psyche. It is 
an iconic part of the countryQs political history and has 
near full support throughout New Zealand (Even the 
visiting Dalai Lama praised New ZealandQs nuclear free 
stance). ACTQs argument that New Zealand anti-nuclear 
position should be trashed is out of step with a growing 
consensus in Parliament and in New Zealand society 
itself. 
¶8. (SBU) In previous years the Labour Government might 
have used the occasion of the anniversary to focus on New 
ZealandQs principled stand against the U.S. The fact that 
the Government chose to focus instead on the warming of 
the bilateral relationship and proliferation issues 
demonstrates how much it wants to keep relations on their 
improving track. End Comment
