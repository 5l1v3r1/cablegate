¶1.  (U)  Prime Minister Stephen Harper on February 10 expressed 
Canada's concern about Iran's nuclear enrichment program as well as 
its "deplorable human rights practices."   He pledged to use 
Canada's G8 presidency in 2010 to work with partners to "hold Iran 
to account" through "strong and viable solutions, including 
sanctions."   Full text in para 2. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin text of the Prime Minister's statement on February 
10: 
 
 
 
Canada is deeply disturbed by Iran's decision further to enrich its 
nuclear material in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. 
The regime's latest moves bring Iran considerably closer to 
possessing weapons-grade material. 
 
Iran's past history of deliberately concealing aspects of its 
nuclear program makes this latest move even more worrying.  Through 
its actions, Iran continues to test the resolve of the 
international community. 
 
It is time for Iran to end its defiance of the international 
community, suspend its enrichment activity and take immediate steps 
toward transparency and compliance by halting the construction of 
new enrichment sites, and fully cooperating with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. 
 
Canada will continue to work with our allies to find strong and 
viable solutions, including sanctions, to hold Iran to account. 
Canada will use its G-8 presidency to continue to focus 
international attention and action on the Iranian regime. 
 
In addition to our unease with the Iranian nuclear program, Canada 
will continue to voice our very serious concerns with the Iranian 
regime's stifling of democracy, its deplorable human rights 
practices, and its negative implications for both regional and 
global stability.
