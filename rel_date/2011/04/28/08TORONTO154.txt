¶1. (U) In a May 15 Toronto speech Stephane Dion, Liberal Party chief 
and leader of the Official Opposition in Canada's federal House of 
Commons, argued Canada's tax system should be restructured to reduce 
pollution and poverty in Canada.  While he did not reveal when he 
would move to bring down the Conservative minority government, Dion 
suggested that the Liberals would use the coming weeks and months to 
contrast the Liberals' "Politics of Hope" with Conservative Prime 
Minister Harper's "head in the sand" policies. 
 
¶2. (SBU) While scrupulously avoiding the term "carbon tax," Dion 
asserted that the Liberals would overhaul Canada's tax system in a 
revenue-neutral fashion to "create competitive advantages by 
lowering taxes on ... income, innovation, savings, and investment 
... and shift those taxes to the things we want less of-pollution, 
greenhouse gas emissions, smog, and waste."  Dion said this shift 
would unleash a "moral dynamic" in the economy that would help 
middle-class Canadians better provide for future generations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Dion, switching between his native French and grammatical, 
but difficult to understand English, also outlined his 
qualifications to serve as prime minister, saying he would make the 
country "richer, fairer, and greener."  As an example of his 
leadership under difficult circumstances, he pointed to his role in 
strengthening Canadian federalism as the minister responsible for 
securing the passage of the Clarity Act, which details the 
requirements for federal acceptance of any Quebec sovereignty 
referendum and has left Dion deeply unpopular in his native 
province. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT:  Dion's speech, an awkward cross between a 
campaign speech and detailed policy presentation, failed to ignite 
the crowd of Toronto business leaders and over a dozen Toronto-area 
Liberal MPs.  His remarks drew scattered applause, and a delayed, 
reluctant standing ovation.  A staffer for former Liberal PM Paul 
Martin told Poloff that he would have preferred a more defined time 
frame for an election, and that the speech did little to dispel 
perceptions among Liberals that Dion is a weak leader. 
Interestingly, Dion did not touch on foreign policy issues, 
including Canada's presence in Afghanistan.  END COMMENT.
