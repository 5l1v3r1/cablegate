Â¶1.  (U)  The Canadian Forces confirmed to DATT that their 60 day 
deployment to Haiti will end o/a March 13.  The deployments will be 
somewhat staggered, with the Disaster Assistance Relief Team (DART) 
and at least one ship and possibly some helicopters departing 
first.  Any extension will have to go through a close scrutiny, but 
the likelihood of additional CF staff contributions in support of 
MINUSHTAH would be only a handful of people at most.  As of 
February 11, there were 1,979 CF on the ground in Haiti.  The 
government has not directed the Department of National Defence or 
the Canadian Forces to plan for any possible continuing presence.
