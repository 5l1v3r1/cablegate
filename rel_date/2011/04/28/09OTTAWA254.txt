(SBU) In response to reftel A points Peter Fawcett, Deputy 
Director, South Asia Division, Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade, said that Canada is looking forward 
to the April 17 conference.  He agrees that Canada should 
participate at the Ministerial level and has recommended that 
either the Minister of Foreign Affairs or the Minister for 
International Development attend the event.  However, Canada 
has not yet finalized the decision on who will attend the 
conference.  Fawcett said the GOC has not yet determined if 
or how much it will contribute, but pointed out that Pakistan 
is a high priority within Canada's international aid regime.
