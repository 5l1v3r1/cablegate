SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050193101 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050193101 for the export of 
International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled turbine 
engine lubricating oil tanks to Australia. Post is requested 
to complete this Blue Lantern inquiry within 45 days.  Lack 
of response to a Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Subject application 050193101 is the 
third in a series of license request from applicant to export 
oil tanks to the Australian Department of Defense (ADOD) via 
Milspec Services Pty Ltd (foreign intermediate consignee) and 
Safe Air Ltd (foreign consignee). License 050146824 
originally approved the export of five tanks.  License 
050169857 covered three replacement tanks because three of 
the five tanks from the original shipment were claimed by 
Safe Air to be damaged beyond repair.  The subject license 
requested export of another three tanks to replace three of 
the previously shipped tanks that are again claimed to be in 
non-repairable condition. 
 
¶4. ACTION: The Department requests that Post make inquiries 
with Safe Air Ltd. in order to: (1) verify that eleven tanks 
were received; (2) verify the claim that six were in 
non-repairable condition; (3) verify if the tanks have been 
delivered to the ADOD; and (4) determine the disposition of 
the non-repairable tanks. 
 
END ACTION.
