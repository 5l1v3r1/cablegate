SUBJECT: CANADA: DEMARCHE REQUEST FOR ROME RULE OF LAW 
CONFERENCE ON AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: SECSTATE 87370 
 
(SBU/NF) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Gallit Dobner, 
Desk Officer for Afghanistan and Action officer for the Rule 
of Law Conference at DFAIT.  Dobner said that the GOC is 
fully behind the PJCM and will announce that it is setting up 
an office in Kandahar at the conference.  With regards to 
multilateral funding, she said that Canada is not sure what 
is being asked at the Rome conference, as the documents they 
have received indicated that a funding mechanism would be set 
up but it is not clear if this has happened yet.  She said 
they would not be in a position to contribute until this 
mechanism is up and running and the GOC can review how it 
will function.  Canada will also announce several new 
bilateral programs at the conference.  Dobner said that 
Canada would appreciate any further information we may have 
about what we will be doing and hopes that as the conference 
draws closer, organization by the hosts, which she described 
as dismal, improves.
