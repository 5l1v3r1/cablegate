¶2.  (U)  Begin text 
"Today in Annapolis, the Israelis and Palestinians agreed in a joint 
understanding to work toward a peace agreement by the end of 2008. 
This historic development came about through the determination, 
vision and efforts of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and 
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, and under the firm 
leadership of the United States. 
"The progress achieved during this conference brings renewed hope. 
We were especially encouraged by the robust presence and support of 
the international community, notably those from the Arab world, 
whose renewed commitment is vital for a comprehensive peace 
agreement. We also welcomed the international community's commitment 
to helping the Palestinians improve security, build modern 
governance institutions, develop their economy and create 
prosperity. 
"The dual pillars of Canada's principled policy on the Middle East 
are our long-standing support for the security and well-being of 
Israel and its legitimate place within the Middle East and the 
international community, and our support for the establishment of a 
democratic, peaceful Palestinian state. 
"Canada will continue to support the parties and U.S. leadership as 
negotiations move forward toward everyone's goal: two states living 
in peace and security."
