NOMINATING-OFFICER: Field Rep Betty Rice 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Al Scholz has been very active in the current dialogue in 
Saskatchewan regarding rural economic development, 
appropriate land use, and issues surrounding the use of 
water.  He has been involved in organizations such as the 
Saskatchewan Agrivision Corporation, which recently 
established a provincial water council to determine 
Saskatchewan's water needs and to essentially "drought- 
proof" the economy.  Al has been involved in a variety of 
areas with respect to rural economy in Saskatchewan, 
including rural population growth and retention, grain and 
livestock development, and resource management.   He's a 
good listener too-Al spends a fair amount of time talking to 
people in rural communities, after which he writes articles 
about best practices and lessons learned in those 
communities.  Outgoing and bright, Al would gain much from a 
study tour on water management, one of the looming 
environmental and economic questions of the coming decades, 
as well as other developments in rural economics.
