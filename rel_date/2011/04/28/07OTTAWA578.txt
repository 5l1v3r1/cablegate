REF: A. OTTAWA 453 
 
     ¶B. STATE 38553 
 
¶1. (SBU) On March 28, Economic Minister-Counselor delivered 
ref B demarche to John Hannaford, Director of DFAIT's United 
Nations, Human Rights, and Economic Law Division and urged 
quick GoC action to implement sanctions imposed by UNSCR 
1747, especially with regard to Bank Sepah.  Economic 
Minister-Counselor noted that on March 24, Foreign Minister 
MacKay issued a statement after the unanimous adoption of 
UNSCR 1747, saying that Canada fully supports the resolution, 
as it did UNSCR 1737 on Iran.  MacKay said that Canada will 
implement the measures outlined in the new resolution "fully 
and expeditiously." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Hannaford explained that the GoC bureaucracy is 
moving quickly to implement fully UNSCR 1747 through 
procedures laid down to implement UNSCR 1737 (ref A).  With 
specific reference to Bank Sepah and other entities and 
individuals named in the Resolution, he said that the Office 
of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI) 
has already acted.  On March 27, OSFI issued a notice to all 
Canadian Financial Institutions, ordering them to review 
their records for the accounts of the listed individuals and 
entities and to freeze assets if they are found.  GoC 
departments are developing regulations to implement other 
parts of the Resolution, such as import restrictions.  These 
will be assembled into a package for consideration by 
Canada's Treasury Board, the Cabinet body which reviews 
government regulations.  The regulations will go into effect 
upon the approval of the Governor General in Council, acting 
under the authority of the United Nations Act.  Hannaford 
declined to speculate when this step will be taken, saying 
only that it will be done long before the end of the 60 day 
period after which countries must report on their actions to 
carry out UNSCR 1747.
