¶8. (SBU) SECURITY INFORMATION: 
 
¶A. (SBU) ALL U.S. CITIZEN PERSONNEL SERVING UNDER THE 
CHIEF OF MISSION AUTHORITY IN A TEMPORARY STATUS OF 30 
DAYS OR MORE MUST COMPLETE APPROPRIATE OVERSEAS PERSONAL 
SECURITY TRAINING PRIOR TO TRAVEL (04 STATE 66580). 
EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE SECURITY OVERSEAS 
SEMINAR COURSE AT THE FOREIGN SERVICE INSTITUTE (FSI) 
AFTER JUNE 1, 2000, MEET THIS REQUIREMENT.  ALL OTHER TDY 
PERSONNEL MUST EITHER (1) COMPLETE THE APPROVED SEMINAR 
AT FSI ENTITLED "SERVING ABROAD FOR FAMILIES & EMPLOYEES" 
(SAFE), OR (2) HAVE THEIR AGENCY CERTIFY TO THE 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE'S BUREAU OF DIPLOMATIC SECURITY THAT 
THE EMPLOYEE HAS UNDERGONE EQUIVALENT SECURITY TRAINING.

WELLINGTON 00000071  002 OF 003 
 
 
TRAINING AT (703) 205-2617.  COUNTRY CLEARANCE WILL NOT 
BE GRANTED FOR ANY TRAVELER WITH PLANNED TDY IN EXCESS OF 
30 DAYS IF THIS INFORMATION IS NOT STATED/CERTIFIED. POC

¶B. (SBU) THE U.S. MISSION TO NEW ZEALAND CURRENTLY RATES 
THE THREAT FROM TRANSNATIONAL AND INDIGENOUS TERRORISM AS 
LOW.  THERE ARE NO TERRORIST GROUPS OR SUPPORT GROUPS 
BELIEVED TO BE OPERATING IN NEW ZEALAND AT THIS TIME.  IN 
LIGHT OF THE WORLDWIDE SECURITY ALERT ALL VISITORS SHOULD 
HEIGHTEN THEIR SECURITY AWARENESS AND REPORT ANY UNUSUAL 
INCIDENTS TO THE REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICER. 
 
¶C. (SBU) ANONYMOUS TELEPHONIC THREATS AND OBSCURE THREAT 
MAIL HAVE OCCASIONALLY TARGETED U.S. DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS 
IN NEW ZEALAND.  IN RESPONSE TO U.S. POLICIES AND 
ACTIONS, VARIOUS GROUPS IN NEW ZEALAND HAVE DEMONSTRATED 
OCCASIONALLY AT THE EMBASSY IN WELLINGTON AND AT THE 
CONSULATE IN AUCKLAND.  THESE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE USUALLY 
SMALL AND ARE PEACEFULLY CONDUCTED.  DURING THESE 
DEMONSTRATIONS, THE HOST COUNTRY POLICE AND PROTECTIVE 
SERVICES NORMALLY PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION TO THE 
EMBASSY AND CONSULATE. 
 
¶D. (SBU) NEW ZEALAND IS CONSIDERED A MEDIUM THREAT CRIME 
ENVIRONMENT. AS SUCH, WELLINGTON AND AUCKLAND HAVE 
EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN VIOLENT AND PETTY CRIMES, BUT 
THEY ARE USUALLY NON-CONFRONTATIONAL IN NATURE.  HOWEVER, 
HOME INVASION ROBBERIES AND ASSAULTS, ONCE VERY RARE, ARE 
BECOMING MORE FREQUENT.  BURGLARIES AND THEFTS OCCUR 
COUNTRYWIDE BUT PRIMARILY IN THE LARGE CITIES OF 
AUCKLAND, CHRISTCHURCH AND WELLINGTON, AND VISITORS 
SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY AWARE THAT STREET CRIME, SUCH AS 
SCAMS AND PICKPOCKETS IS A DAILY OCCURRENCE IN THESE 
CITIES.  COMMON SENSE PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN, 
ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT, TO AVOID BECOMING A TARGET OF 
OPPORTUNITY. 
 
¶E. (SBU) GENERALLY, NEW ZEALAND DOES NOT PLAY A 
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE WORLD DRUG SITUATION; HOWEVER, 
EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT NEW ZEALAND HAS BEEN UTILIZED AS 
A TRANSIT POINT FOR SHIPMENTS OF ECSTASY, HEROIN AND 
COCAINE TO AUSTRALIA.  THE MOST ABUSED DRUG IN NEW 
ZEALAND IS LOCALLY PRODUCED METHAMPHETAMINE AND CANNABIS. 
THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASED AMOUNTS OF LAB SEIZURES AND 
VIOLENT CRIME ASSOCIATED WITH GROUPS ATTEMPTING TO 
CONTROL THIS MARKET. 
 
¶F. (U) ALL FORMS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ARE GENERALLY 
SAFE AT ALL TIMES OF THE DAY; HOWEVER, AT NIGHT VISITORS 
SHOULD USE COMMON SENSE PRECAUTIONS SO AS TO NOT BECOME A 
TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY. 
 
¶G. (U) THE TRAFFIC SITUATION IN AUCKLAND CAN BE DIFFICULT 
WITH A MODERATE AMOUNT OF CONGESTION. WELLINGTON AND 
CHRISTCHURCH TRAFFIC IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER; HOWEVER, 
DURING RUSH HOUR MODERATE DELAYS CAN BE EXPECTED. 
VISITORS ARE ADVISED THAT TRAFFIC DRIVES ON THE LEFT-HAND 
SIDE OF THE ROAD. VISITORS ARE ADVISED THAT TRAFFIC 
ACCIDENTS ARE COMMON AND THAT IT IS SAFE TO PULL OVER SO 
THAT POLICE MAY TAKE AN ACCIDENT REPORT.  HOWEVER, 
VISITORS WHO EXPERIENCE HOSTILITY OR ANTI-AMERICAN 
SENTIMENT SHOULD DEPART THE SCENE IMMEDIATELY AND NOTIFY 
THE RSO. 
 
¶H. (SBU) TRAVELERS INTENDING TO BRING AND USE ANY USG 
PROVIDED ELECTRONIC OR PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT MUST 
CONTACT THE RSO PRIOR TO INTRODUCING THAT EQUIPMENT INTO 
THE CHANCERY.  PERSONAL ELECTRONIC OR PHOTOGRAPHIC 
EQUIPMENT IS NOT PERMITTED IN THE CHANCERY. ONLY IN 
SEVERELY LIMITED CASES WILL A NOTEBOOK OR LAPTOP COMPUTER 
BE PERMITTED TO BE USED IN THE CHANCERY. 
 
¶I. (U) PRECAUTIONS SHOULD ALSO BE TAKEN TO NOT DISCUSS 
SENSITIVE OR CLASSIFIED INFORMATION OUTSIDE SECURE 
ENVIRONMENTS OR OVER UNSECURED AND/OR CELLULAR 
TELEPHONES, AND TO SECURELY SAFEGUARD CLASSIFIED OR 
SENSITIVE INFORMATION AT THE CHANCERY AND NOT AT HOTELS 
OR RESIDENCES. 
 
¶J. (U) VISITORS SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE OF THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT'S CONSULAR INFORMATION SHEET FOR NEW ZEALAND 
 
WELLINGTON 00000071  003 OF 003 
 
 
AND THE MOST RECENT WORLDWIDE CAUTION PUBLIC 
ANNOUNCEMENTS, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET AT 
HTTP://TRAVEL.STATE.GOV 
 
¶K. (U) IN ESSENCE, VISITORS TO NEW ZEALAND MUST EXERCISE 
APPROPRIATE CAUTION AND BE ALERT TO THEIR SURROUNDINGS 
WITH REGARD TO THEIR PERSONAL SECURITY.  SUSPICIOUS 
INCIDENTS/ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE REPORTED TO RSO WELLINGTON 
(TELEPHONE (64)(4)462-6000, 24 HOURS/DAY).
