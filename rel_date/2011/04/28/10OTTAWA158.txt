¶1.  (U) Summary: Canadians have so far contributed C$113 million 
(approximately US$105.6 million) to the Haiti Earthquake Relief 
Fund; the government has pledged to match all such contributions 
through February 12.  In addition, the Government of Canada has 
earmarked C$135 million (approximately US$126.2 million) for 
humanitarian assistance, relief, and reconstruction efforts in 
Haiti.  Over 2,00 federal government as well as Canadian Forces 
(CF) personnel are now working in Haiti.  The province of Quebec 
has also responded robustly to the disaster (ref b).  Even before 
the January 12 earthquake, Haiti was the second largest recipient 
of Canadian development assistance worldwide (ref c).  End summary. 
 
 
 
DONATIONS TOP $113 MILLION, BUT STILL TIME FOR "ONE BIG PUSH" 
 
 
 
¶2. (U)  During a February 8 visit to the Canadian Red Cross in 
Ottawa, Minister of International Cooperation Bev Oda cited the 
C$113 million in contributions by individual Canadians to the Haiti 
Earthquake Relief Fund so far, and reiterated the government's 
pledge to match all contributions between January 12 and February 
12 (having abandoned an initial cap of C$50 million for matching 
funds).  The Minister stated that the outpouring of generosity had 
"extended far beyond expectations" and made her "proud to be 
Canadian."  Ms. Oda urged Canadians to "make that one final effort, 
one big push" to maximize their contribution by February 12.  The 
Government of Canada will allocate the funds to Canadian and 
international humanitarian and development organizations in support 
of relief and recovery efforts in Haiti. 
 
 
 
GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO DATE 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) Through the Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA), Canada has already provided C$85 million (US$79.5 million) 
in urgent humanitarian aid to Haiti.  This includes:  C$5 million 
(US$ 4.6 million) for urgent needs; C$60 million (US$56.1 million) 
to the UN appeal to fund essential necessities and basic services 
through UN agencies; C$11.5 million (US$10.7 million) to support 
critical relief efforts by Canadian NGOS, such as CARE, Medecins du 
Monde, Save the Children, Oxfam Quebec, the Centre for 
International Studies and Cooperation (CECI), and World Vision; 
and, C$8.5 million (US$ 7.9 million) to the International 
Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  CIDA also 
supports a field hospital managed by the Canadian and Norwegian Red 
Cross, and sent supplies such as tents, tarpaulins, tools, mosquito 
nets, hygiene kits, kitchen sets, water buckets, and jerry cans to 
Haiti.  To date, the Government of Canada has earmarked a total of 
C$135 million (US$ 126.2 million) for humanitarian assistance, 
relief, and reconstruction efforts. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (U)  Canada has deployed 56 expert personnel to assist with the 
relief effort in Haiti from a range of government departments, 
including the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade, CIDA, Canadian Border Services Agency, and the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police.  Services include search and rescue, 
medical and logistics personnel, engineers, and humanitarian and 
disaster victim identification experts.  Another 19 Canadian 
humanitarian technical experts, including medical staff, support 
aid agencies on the ground in Haiti.  Canada has also worked 
closely with the Government of Haiti, the United Nations, and the 
international community in support of a coordinated response to the 
disaster. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (U)  As of February 5, 2,032 Canadian Forces (CF) personnel are 
serving in Haiti as part of Operation Hestia, the CF component of 
the Canadian government's whole-of-government response to the 
earthquake.  The Joint Task Force Haiti has six CH-146 Griffon 
tactical helicopters in use, while CF aircraft have airlifted 3.5 
million pounds of relief items from Canada, of which CF helicopters 
in Haiti have distributed over 136,000 pounds.  CF personnel have 
distributed 157,000 liters of water and 372,900 meals, and have 
treated over 6,000 patients.
