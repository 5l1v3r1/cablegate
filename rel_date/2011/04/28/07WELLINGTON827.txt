¶1.  (SBU)  On November 21, Pol/Econ Counselor met with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT Disarmament 
Division Director Carolyn McDonald and the Division's Senior 
Policy Officer Raylene Liufalani regarding the demarche 
outlined in reftel.  Both McDonald and Liufalani had been in 
touch with their mission in Vienna regarding El Baradei's 
report and had participated in US Mission UNVienna briefings. 
 They said that the GNZ view on Iranian compliance was very 
much in line with that of the USG, and New Zealand agreed 
that unanswered questions regarding Iran's nuclear program 
remained.  Both were appreciative of papers and other 
background materials that the US Mission in Vienna had 
provided to the New Zealand Embassy. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Liufalani said that New Zealand, as an observer to 
the Board of Governors meeting, would provide public comment 
and urge that Iran address continued concerns on the part of 
the international community.
