SUBJECT: DVC Request with Gail Blanke 
 
 
¶1. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Post requests a DVC with Gail 
Blanke, President and CEO of Lifedesigns, LLC, in New 
York. 
 
¶2. Preferred Activity Date, Fiscal Year, and Quarter: 
This is an FY06 program, which is requested for week 
starting December 6; first quarter. 
 
¶3.  JUSTIFICATION OF PROGRAM: Post requests this award- 
winning author as part of our management series with the 
New Zealand Institute of Management.  Reaction to these 
programs has been excellent thus far, attracting standing- 
room only audiences; they are a significant part of the 
Embassy's commitment to best practice in the workplace. 
 
Considered one of the best motivational speakers in the 
U.S., Ms Blanke has delivered keynote addresses for many 
corporations and events such as the "Global Summit of 
Women" in Taiwan, the "Decade to Democracy" conference in 
Budapest, and Cornell University's symposium, 
"Contracting Out: Danger Signal for Working Men and 
Women." 
 
The author of such titles as "Between Trapezes: Flying 
Into a New Life with the Greatest of Ease" and "In My 
Wildest Dreams," Ms Blanke would participate in a 
discussion that would encourage attendees to think 
"outside the box," to ponder new ideas, to promote her 
books, and to establish ongoing relationships. The NZ 
Institute of Management has over 4,000 members nation- 
wide, and media coverage is also likely. 
 
Outcome: To inspire businesspeople to practice good 
management; to look at work/life balance issues and 
diversity in the workplace; to create/explore new 
possibilities in careers and personal lives; and to 
create/reinforce contacts between U.S. business experts 
and New Zealand managers in business and government. 
 
¶4. Audience Expected:  To include business people, 
academics, opinion-makers, policy-makers, economists, 
think-tankers, members of the New Zealand Institute of 
International Affairs (NZIIA), and the media.
