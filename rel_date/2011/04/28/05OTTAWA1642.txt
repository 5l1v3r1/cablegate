NOMINATING-OFFICER: PAO Nick Giacobbe 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
David Morley has extensive experience in government, 
business and the private sector.  For various reasons the 
federal government is coming under increasing pressure from 
the provinces and municipalities to revenue share as urban 
centers are experiencing stress from lack of funds.  Morley 
has been tasked with helping communities reinvent 
themselves. This is a situation that is significant and 
timely both in the United States and Canada.  The U.S. 
experience in urban development and urban renewal has met 
with challenges.  As deteriorating conditions turn up the 
political rhetoric, public pressure forces governments to 
act.  Faced with similar situations: crumbling 
infrastructure and decreasing tax base (both residential and 
industrial) they choose to partner government and the 
private sector.    There is little history and even less 
research and background on urban renewal in Canada.  Morley 
would gain a lot from a program that views historical 
relationships between levels of government, development of 
the socio-economic dialogue, performance and the accounting 
mechanisms and at the same time develops an appreciation of 
state, municipal and federal government structure.   An 
avenue that could also be explored is the decay of 
infrastructure at border crossings vital to both economies, 
with exploration of options for planning and implementing 
border infrastructure to serve the needs of both countries.

NOMINATING-OFFICER: PAO Alyson Grunder 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Having begun her career as a Regional Coordinator for the 
federal Progressive Conservatives Party, Isabelle Hudon has 
risen rapidly through a series of strategic communications 
and media relations positions, in both the federal 
government and the private sector.  Her experience at the 
Canadian Space Agency, Bombardier and BCE Enterprises gave 
her excellent background and contacts in aerospace and 
telecommunications, two sectors historically at the 
forefront of Montreal's economic development. She has also 
been active in Montreal's civic life, taking leadership 
roles in the political development of the so-called 
"megacity," created by the merger of numerous surrounding 
municipalities and the center city into one entity. 
Articulate in both French and English and a confidante of 
many in Quebec's overlapping business and political world, 
Hudon was recently promoted to President and CEO of the 
Montreal Board of Trade, the city's leading private economic 
development organization. The almost 200-year old Board of 
Trade (Chambre de commerce du Montral mtropolitain is its 
French title), at 7,000 members currently, has been an 
important force in nearly every major development of the 
city's growth, from the construction of Montreal's port 
facilities to the restructuring of municipal government. 
Both provincial political parties, the Parti Qubcois and 
the Parti liberal du Qubec, are considering the use of 
public-private partnerships - a strategy long in use in the 
U.S. but quite new in Quebec - to accomplish certain large 
infrastructure projects and for some public service 
delivery.  Hudon wants to position the Board to play a 
leading role in developing a Quebec model for so-called 
lled 
PPPs, and in promoting various pilot projects, including 
infrastructure related to cross-border and international 
trade facilitation.  Hudon would like to explore the 
burgeoning partnerships between American businesses and all 
levels of government that are helping to prepare U.S. cities 
for the globalization era, and resulting in urban 
infrastructure and transportation projects, environmental 
clean-ups, education and training improvements and enhanced 
community participation.
