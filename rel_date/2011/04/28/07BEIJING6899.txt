SUBJECT: OCTOBER 30 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: SIX-PARTY TALKS, 
IRAN SANCTIONS, DIAOYUTAI, DALAI LAMA, DARFUR 
 
 
¶1. Key points at the October 30 MFA Press Briefing: 
 
-- China has expressed its "strong dissatisfaction" 
and opposition to Canada's hosting of the Dalai Lama. 
Canada should correct its actions to avoid further 
damage to bilateral ties. 
 
-- Japan's actions against Chinese activists near the 
Diaoyutai Islands violate international law and 
infringe upon China's sovereignty. 
 
-- Iran is willing to solve the nuclear issue through 
talks and any additional sanctions against Iran will 
"aggravate" the situation. 
 
-- The Six-Party Talks are making "steady" progress 
and China hopes all parties will move toward 
denuclearization and normalization. 
 
-- Criticism by British lawmakers of China's Sudan 
policy is irresponsible and ignores China's 
constructive role in Darfur. 
 
-- Chinese Politburo Member Liu Yunshan is visiting 
the DPRK, Vietnam and Laos to brief on the outcome of 
the 17th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. 
 
Arrival of A/S Hill, SixParty Talks 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. MFA Spokesperson Liu Jianchao confirmed EAP 
Assistant Secretary Hill's October 30 arrival in 
Beijing.  The U.S. delegation will meet with Chinese 
Foreign Ministry officials to discuss the situation on 
the Korean Peninsula and the Six-Party Talks.  Chinese 
officials will also meet with North Korean delegation 
leader Kim Kye-gwan at an appropriate time.  China 
believes progress in the Six-Party process is "steady" 
and hopes that all parties can proceed to implement 
relevant agreements and move toward denuclearization 
and normalization. 
 
Iran 
---- 
 
¶3. In response to a question regarding Israeli Foreign 
Minister Tzipi Livni's comments urging China to 
support sanctions against Iran, Liu said that a 
peaceful solution to the Iran issue isin the interest 
of the international communit.  China hopes that the 
use of sanctions will "not be encouraged."  Iran is 
seeking to solve the issue through talks and exerting 
sanctions will "aggravate" the situation, Liu said. 
 
King Abdullah Visiting China 
---------------------------- 
 
¶4. Jordan's King Abdullah arrived in Beijing October 
29 and held talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao on 
October 30.  The two leaders exchanged ideas on the 
Middle East peace process.  China believes that there 
has been "some progress" in the Middle East and China 
is ready to make "joint efforts with relevant parties" 
to promote the peace process. 
 
Japan Action Against Diaoyutai Activists 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. Asked about reports of confrontations between 
Japanese patrol boats and a vessel carrying Chinese 
protestors near the Diaoyutai Islands, Liu stated that 
Diaoyutai and the surrounding islands have been 
inseparable parts of Chinese territory "since ancient 
times."  Japan's action against the Diaoyutai 
activists violates international law and infringes 
upon China's sovereignty.  Liu said he had no 
knowledge regarding reports that Japan detained the 
activists.

Dalai Lama Meeting With Canadian PM 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. Commenting on the October 29 meeting between 
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Dalai 
Lama, Liu urged Canada to reflect upon and "correct 
erroneous practices" to avoid further damage to China- 
Canada relations.  The Dalai Lama's actions over the 
last several decades show that he is a "splitist" who 
undermines national unity "under the disguise of 
religion."  Canada's leaders insisted on hosting and 
meeting with the Dalai Lama despite the 
representations of the Chinese government.  China has 
expressed its "strong dissatisfaction" and opposition 
to the Canadian side. 
 
Darfur 
------ 
 
¶7. Liu criticized British parliamentarians as 
"irresponsible" for their condemnation of China's 
Sudan policy.  One hundred members of the British 
Parliament signed a letter addressed to Chinese 
President Hu Jintao calling on China to halt arms 
sales to Sudan.  Liu stated that China has played a 
"constructive" role in Darfur.  Liu urged support for 
UN and African Union efforts and said all rebel groups 
should join in negotiations for a comprehensive peace 
agreement.  The accusations against China by U.K. 
lawmakers "disregard" the constructive role China has 
played. 
 
Party-to-Party Visits to DPRK, Vietnam, Laos 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶8. Chinese Politburo Member Liu Yunshan is visiting 
the DPRK, Vietnam and Laos at the invitation of those 
countries' respective ruling parties.  During the 
visits, which will last from October 29 to November 3, 
Liu will brief his hosts on the outcome of the 17th 
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. 
 
China-Kazakhstan Cooperation Committee 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. The next round of the China-Kazakhstan Cooperation 
Committee will take place November 7, Liu announced.
