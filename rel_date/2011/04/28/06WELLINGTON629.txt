SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 132517 
 
WELLINGTON 592 
 
¶1. (U) On August 14, Acting DCM delivered reftel information to 
Darryl Dunn, Director, Middle East and Africa Division, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Dunn said that GNZ welcomes the resolution and remains 
interested in participating in a UN force.  Ministry of Defence 
officials have been discussing possible participation for the past 
few weeks, and were to meet again on the issue later in the day. 
Dunn promised to let ADCM know the outcome of the meeting, but he 
cautioned that GNZ needs more details about what the peacekeeping 
force will entail before making a final decision.  He reminded ADCM 
that because of ongoing commitments in Afghanistan, Timor, and the 
Solomon's, New Zealand's contributions will be limited, with a few 
military liaisons being the most likely (Ref B). 
 
¶3. (U) Prime Minister Clark also issued a public statement on the 
resolution on August 12, with a similar note of New Zealand's 
willingness to participate in peacekeeping but also a similar note of 
caution as to the scope of its contribution.  The complete text 
follows: 
 
NZ welcomes UN resolution for Middle East 
 
Prime Minister Helen Clark today welcomed news that the United 
Nations Security Council had earlier today (NZT) unanimously passed a 
resolution calling for a full cessation of hostilities in southern 
Lebanon. 
 
"Reaching agreement on this resolution has been a protracted and 
difficult process. The next steps towards achieving an immediate 
ceasefire and a lasting solution may be just as trying." 
 
"The onus now lies on the governments of Lebanon and Israel to accept 
the resolution as the basis for moving forward. They must work, in 
conjunction with the UN Secretary-General, to agree on the cessation 
of hostilities and the implementation of the steps identified in the 
resolution for the phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern 
Lebanon and the compliance of all parties with the ceasefire 
arrangements. 
 
"The international community will need to play its part in supporting 
the implementation of the resolution. I call on all parties involved 
in this tragic conflict, as well as the wider international 
community, to use their influence to help bring peace and a lasting 
solution. 
 
"New Zealand stands ready to consider what role we might play in an 
expanded UN presence in southern Lebanon, taking into account the 
other demands on our Defence Force," Helen Clark.
