¶1. (SBU) The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) union has tentatively 
agreed with Ford Canada to freeze wages and reduce vacation pay in 
their new three-year contract, which will enter into force on 
September 17, 2008.  The agreement enables the union to avoid the 
two-tiered wage system introduced in the Ford contract with the 
United Auto Workers union in the U.S. last fall, but means that 
Ford's Canadian auto manufacturing operations will remain much 
higher cost than elsewhere. 
 
¶2. (SBU) CAW President Buzz Hargrove held meetings early in the 
spring with all three of the Detroit auto makers in hopes of 
jump-starting negotiations (ref (A)).  The CAW has never reached a 
deal or even chosen a target company with which to negotiate this 
early in the process; negotiations typically begin in July. 
Hargrove said this so-called master economics offer will be the 
centerpiece of CAW-Ford negotiations to finalize local plant issues 
later this week, and will likely be voted on next weekend.  If a 
deal is reached and approved by the union membership, the CAW will 
move on to negotiate with the Canadian units of GM and Chrysler, in 
what the union believes will follow the traditional pattern of 
bargaining in Canada, where a deal with one auto company becomes a 
model for contracts with the other two. 
 
¶3. (SBU) A contact at Ford told us on April 28 that the company was 
pleased with the tentative agreement with the CAW.  Demand for the 
Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX crossover utility vehicles, built at 
Ford's Oakville, Ontario assembly plant, along with the new Ford 
Flex CUV, which will be added to the production lineup in July, has 
been hot, and the company is ramping up to meet production goals 
(ref (A)).  Hargrove told us on April 28 that he is relieved that a 
tentative deal has been reached with Ford.

¶4. (U) The CAW has agreed to the wage freeze, co-payments for 
prescription drugs, and a progressive pay system for new hires over 
three years (starting at 70% of base wages, but by the third year, 
new hire compensation will match that of existing employees).  The 
union has also agreed to a cost of living adjustment (COLA) freeze 
for all workers until December 2009, when COLA increases will 
resume.  Ford has agreed to pay employees a C$2,200 "productivity 
and quality" bonus if the agreement is ratified next week, as well 
as compensate workers for reducing their vacation pay by 40 hours 
per year, with a C$3,500 cash payment in January 2009.  Pensions 
will be indexed to inflation for retirees in the second and third 
years of the agreement.  Ford's assembly plant near St. Thomas, 
Ont., which was scheduled to be closed in 2010, and has been 
operating on one shift since last year, will be kept open another 
year.  The company has agreed to work with the CAW to find a new 
product to replace the full-sized cars produced in St. Thomas (Crown 
Victoria, Mercury Grand Marquis, and Lincoln Town Car). 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  While the CAW-Ford negotiations are running 
smoothly, CAW deals with GM and Chrysler are expected to be more 
difficult to reach.  On April 28, GM announced more shift reductions 
at its North American truck operations, reducing its Oshawa, Ontario 
truck production to one shift and slashing 900 jobs.  With 
slackening demand for larger vehicles, the CAW will not be able to 
use the production demand card it could play with Ford as a 
bargaining chip with GM or Chrysler.  The Detroit Three also had 
hoped to narrow the C$30 per hour cost gap with U.S. operations of 
Japanese automakers, and the deal fails to do that.  End Comment.
