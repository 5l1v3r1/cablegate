SUBJECT: Guilty Plea in Ontario Human Trafficking Case 
 
Sensitive But Unclassified - Please protect accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On May 13, 2008, a Niagara Falls, Ontario 
resident, Imrani Nakpamgi, pled guilty to two counts of human 
trafficking.  The guilty plea represents the first successful 
prosecution under a 2005 law criminalizing certain 
prostitution-related human trafficking offenses in Canada.  Nakpamgi 
was convicted of using intimidation and coercion to force two 
underage girls to perform sex acts for money in the Greater Toronto 
Area (GTA).  The case is a positive signal that law enforcement 
agencies and public prosecutors recognize that the sex trade may 
involve human trafficking, even if in this case the victims were not 
smuggled across international or internal domestic borders.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) On May 13, 2008, a 26 year old Niagara Falls, Ontario 
resident, Imrani Nakpamgi, pled guilty to two counts of human 
trafficking and living off of the avails of prostitution.  Nakpamgi 
admitted that he used threats and intimidation to force two teenage 
girls, initially aged 14 and 15 respectively, to provide 
prostitution related services in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) for 
C$300 per hour from 2005 to 2007. 
 
¶3. (U) Nakpamgi escorted and set up appointments for the two girls 
to perform sex acts for clients in various hotels in Mississauga and 
Brampton over a two year period.  Crown prosecutors estimate 
Nakpamgi earned more than C$400,000 through the two girls, who had 
both been reported missing, the older one by her family and the 
younger one by Children's Aid Society.  Investigators determined 
that the girls' services were being advertised via the internet. 
The court is scheduled to sentence Nakpamgi on May 26.  We 
understand that he could face a sentence of up to 14 years in 
prison, or life. 
 
¶4. (SBU) COMMENT:  The successful human trafficking conviction is a 
positive signal--after the failure of previous cases--that the new 
2005 anti-trafficking laws can be an effective tool for law 
enforcement and prosecutors.  Our recent conversations with 
Toronto-area law enforcement officers indicate that law enforcement 
officials at all levels are becoming more aware of and sensitive to 
the link between the sex industry and human trafficking (septel). 
END COMMENT.
