-- Efforts aimed at the rescue of the crew of the Chinese cargo ship 
the De Xin Hai were "underway." 
 
-- The Chinese Government would step up efforts and adjust its

Somalia Pirate Issue 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. Efforts aimed at the rescue of the crew of the Chinese cargo ship 
the De Xin Hai were "underway," said spokesman Ma Zhaoxu at the 
October 29 regularly scheduled MFA press conference.  The 
spokesperson refused to confirm reports that China was working with 
the Somali Government to negotiate with the pirates.  The 
spokesperson was aware of Somali Government statements that it would 
eliminate pirates from its shores within two years.  Asked about 
potential Chinese assistance to this effort, Ma stated that China 
had "friendly normal relations" with Somalia. 
 
 
Flu Containment 
--------------- 
 
¶3. The Chinese Government would step up efforts and adjust its 
methods in order to deal with the spread of the flu this season, 
said Ma.  "Major adjustments" would be made to border control 
mechanisms to make them more flexible and scientific.  The 
spokesperson referred reporters to a press conference at the 
Ministry of Health for more information. 
 
Baghdad Bombing 
--------------- 
 
¶4. China was "shocked" by the terrorist attack near its embassy in 
Baghdad and was resolutely opposed to terrorism, said Ma.  China 
hoped that Iraq would be able to deal with the issue to ensure the 
safety and development of its people.  The attack seriously damaged 
the Chinese Embassy and resulted in the injury of two Chinese 
citizens working nearby.  The MFA had directed the Embassy and 
Chinese citizens in Iraq to step up safety precautions and had 
expressed its best wishes to the victims. 
 
Peshawar Terrorist Attack 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. China wished to express its shock at the terrorist attack in 
Peshawar, Pakistan and condolences to the victims and their 
families, said Ma. China opposed terrorism and, as a friendly 
neighbor and all weather friend, would work with Pakistan to help 
protect peace and stability. 
 
Hu Jintao North Korea Meeting 
----------------------------- 
 
¶6. Chinese President Hu Jintao's meeting with North Korean Worker's 
Party Central Committee Secretary Choe Thae-Bok was a meeting 
between the two political parties, said Ma.  The spokesperson 
referred reporters to the International Liaison Department of the 
CCP Central Committee for more information. 
 
British Citizen 
--------------- 
 
¶7. The case of British citizen Akmal Shaikh, sentenced to death for 
smuggling four kilograms of heroin in the Xinjiang Uighur autonomous 
region in 2007, was a judicial issue and was being handled according 
to Chinese law "free from outside interference," the spokesman 
maintained.  The case was still being investigated and reporters 
should wait for the results, said Ma.  Asked whether this meant that 
that Akmal Shaikh's appeal was still outstanding, Ma said that "only 
the Ministry of Justice could answer this question." 
 
Taiwan Arms Sales 
----------------- 
 
¶8. China's position regarding arms sales to Taiwan was clear and 
consistent, said Ma.  China was resolutely against the U.S. or any 
other country selling weapons to Taiwan. 
 
Child Adoption Policy and Family Planning 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. Foreigners who adopted Chinese children were required to follow 
all regulations in the adoption process. The PRC government, claimed

Ma, had always implemented these regulations and would continue to 
do so. Asked whether the One Child Policy encouraged the trafficking 
of children, Ma responded that the policy "should not be accused." 
Family planning was beneficial to the development and wellbeing of 
the Chinese people. 
 
Prime Minister of Canada Visit to China 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶10. The PRC government welcomed Canadian Prime Minister Stephen 
Harper's visit to China in early December and indicated that further 
information will be released in due course.
