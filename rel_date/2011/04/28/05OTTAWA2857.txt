PURCHASE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 175147 
 
Post has identified the following potential sources of 
vegetarian MREs as requested reftel.  If we learn of possible 
addtional sources we will send a follow-up report. 
 
¶1.  Bauly Specialty Foods 
 
Vendor:  Le Baron 
Manufacturer:  Bauly Specialty Foods 
  Mr. Len Bauly 
  7620 Anaka Drive 
  Missassauga, Ontario, Canada L4T 3H7 
 
  1-800-351-FOOD (3663) phone 
  905-677-9734 fax 
 
  info@bauly.com  or  lebauly@yahoo.com 
  http://www.bauly.com 
 
Price per unit, (which has a double serving):  C$7.60 (about 
US$6.50), including taxes. 
NOTE:  This company will provide us with a 40% discount. 
See the following link for a full price summary: 
http://www.bauly.com/PDFPricelist.pdf 
 
Ingredients:  All vegetarian - no animal by products.  They 
do have a small presence in the U.S. so are familiar with FDA 
regulations. 
 
Delivery time:  Bauly can produce approximately 3,000 units 
per week (which, with the double servings, can serve 6,000 
individuals).  They estimate it would take approximately 10 
days for the first delivery (production time included) with 
shipments every seven days thereafter. 
 
Package specifications:  The pouches are 8x8 inches and, when 
filled, are approximately 1 inch thik. 
 
¶2.  Harvest Foodworks 
 
Manufacturer:  Harvest Foodworks 
  Mr. Tony Barnes 
  445 Highway 29 - RR 1 
  Toledo, ON, Canada, K0E 1Y0 
 
  1-800-268-4268 or 613-275-2218 phone 
  613-275-1359  fax 
 
  thefolks@harvestfoodworks.com 
  http://www.harvestfoodworks.com 
 
Price per unit:  The vegetarian unit, which has a 2-year 
shelf life, requires water.  One unit is a 2-portion meal and 
costs C$6.00.  However, the price would be about half that 
for purchases of over 100,000 units. 
 
Ingredients:  Too many to name, but they ship to the US 
frequently so would not expect a problem with FDA inspection. 
 
Delivery time:  Approximately 3-4 weeks for 100,000 units. 
 
Package specifications:  Mr. Barnes was unable to indicate an 
approximate weight.  However, each case has 12 units, with 
105 cases per pallet.

freeze-dry and can foods.  They have a branch in Albion, New 
York and are a supplier to Emergency Essentials in Orem, 
Utah.  They have USDA, FDA, CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection
