USG'S IPR CONCERNS 
 
REF: STATE 121503 
 
¶1. (SBU) On September 14 Econoff delivered points in reftel 
to Julie Boisvert, Senior Trade Policy Analyst, Intellectual 
Property, Information, and Technology Trade Policy Division, 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 
Boisvert said that Canada shares the USG's concerns about the 
anti-IPR focus of the IGWG.  She also quickly pointed out 
that the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) 
Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) scheduled to be held 
in Ottawa On September 20 has been postponed until 
mid-October.  This schedule change was at the request of the 
delegations from several Latin American countries, Boisvert 
said.  These delegations claimed that they have not yet had 
enough time to formulate their positions after the most 
recent meeting in Brazil of like-minded member states (to 
which the United States was not invited). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Boisvert said that Canada is concerned about the 
anti-IPR focus of the IGWG and agrees that the World Health 
Organization (WHO) does not have the technical know-how to 
advise on trade and IPR issues.  Therefore, the Canadian 
delegation is including Canadian IPR and trade experts at 
IGWG meetings.  She also said that Canada will push for the 
PAHO IGWG to coordinate its work with the WTO and WIPO - 
organizations that do have technical competence on trade and 
IPR matters.
