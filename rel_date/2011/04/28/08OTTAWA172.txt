¶1.  (SBU)  According to Director of the Middle East Division 
of the Department of Foreign Affairs Michael Grant, Canada 
decided to make a public statement in Damascus (text in para 
2) in lieu of a demarche to the Syrian government in response 
to reftel demarche.  Its embassy issued the statement on 
January 31. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Begin Text 
 
Canada is deeply concerned about the arrest of Riad Seif, a 
respected member of Syrian civil society.  This development 
has renewed Canada's deep concerns over the human rights 
situation in Syria, as it follows the recent detention of 
other civil society activists associated with the "Damascus 
Declaration." 
 
We urge Syria to take all possible steps to ensure that 
domestic law and practices are in keeping with Syria's 
international human rights obligations, including as they 
pertain to arbitrary arrest and detention, freedom of 
movement, minimum guarantees for judicial proceedings, 
freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of association.
