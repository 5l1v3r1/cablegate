¶1.  (SBU)  On February 28, MFAT economic policy staff 
official John Ballingall spoke with A/DCM regarding demarche 
points (reftel), which post had forwarded to MFAT for review. 
 While Ballingall underscored that his remarks constituted an 
initial reaction, he said that like many IEA members, New 
Zealand supports outreach efforts to China and India.  It is 
important to lift the level of engagement with both 
countries, he continued, due to their growing economies, 
energy consumption, and role in the developing world.  The 
MFAT official observed that the IEA Governing Board must 
think carefully about the level of engagement and the form 
that greater cooperation might take.  He added that there 
were legal considerations as well, and care must taken when 
considering the ramifications on broadening OECD membership. 
He finished by saying that the Governing Board must ensure 
that the IEA and the OECD processes are "appropriately 
aligned," and that New Zealand was looking forward to 
discussions on this issue next month. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Ballingall did not raise Russia or voting rights.
