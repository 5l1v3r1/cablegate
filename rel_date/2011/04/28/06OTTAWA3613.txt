SUBJECT: ADDITIONAL CANADIAN RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE REGARDING 
OECD WORKING GROUP ON BRIBERY 
 
REF: A. STATE 197786 
     ¶B. OTTAWA 3599 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Ottawa has received an additional Canadian 
response to the OECD Working Group on Bribery demarche (ref 
A) that the Embassy Economic Minister-Counselor delivered to 
DFAIT official Mark Moher on December 15.  The initial 
response was reported in ref B. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Begin text.  Response to U.S. Embassy Demarche of 
December 15, 2006 - OECD Working Group on Bribery 
 
Canada would like to thank the U.S. for its demarche on the 
OECD Working Group on Bribery (WGB). 
 
Canada agrees that there is value in a robust peer review 
process for the WGB.  We also believe, however, that any 
post-Phase II review must be clearly focussed on issues 
identified by the WGB as necessary, and not seek to impose 
the implementation of recommendations from countries' Phase 
II evaluation - recommendations that are not, strictly 
speaking, Convention obligations.  The exact nature and 
extent of this focus has yet to be agreed upon by members of 
the WGB. 
 
This process should be carefully targeted and should be 
regularly reviewed to ensure that it is still valuable and 
necessary.  We must be careful to ensure that there is as 
little overlap with the UNCAC as possible and that resources 
for the WGB reflect the refined and streamlined vision that 
the WSG has already expressed for post-Phase II. 
 
Canada is in favour of greater sharing of law enforcement 
experience, but notes that we are unable to share details of 
ongoing investigations. 
 
Canada too favours extending the application of the OECD 
anti-bribery disciplines to the major emerging economies. 
 
Canada has made clear our position on WGB budgetary matters. 
We have expressed support for the extraordinary funds from 
the CFP discretionary fund to meet legitimate needs relating 
to planning the post-Phase II monitoring regime.  Canada has 
also indicated that we do not necessarily support the OECD 
work program call for a 140K euro cut to the WGB.  Canada 
suggested that a cut may be possible, as we are looking at a 
more streamlined review, but noted that we cannot possibly 
know yet what amount of funds will be required.
