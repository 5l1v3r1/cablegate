REF: STATE 13508 
 
¶1. In response to reftel, Post has prepared the following 
information on the status of the European Union's proposed 
Electronic Travel Authorization System (ETSA), planned 
updates to the Schengen Information System, and planned Visa 
Information System.  Each component is described below. 
 
¶2. Status of EU Proposal to Establish an EU Electronic Travel 
Authorization.  In a February 2008 communication the European 
Commission stated it would begin investigating the 
feasibility of an electronic system of travel authorization 
(ESTA).  The ESTA would be required for all third-country 
nationals not subject to visa requirements.  These passengers 
would be required to provide data identifying the traveler 
and providing passport and travel details.  This would allow 
the EU to ensure the person fulfilled entry conditions, 
without requiring a full visa interview.  The Commission will 
launch a study on the feasibility of this program in 2008. 
At this point there is no reaction from the European 
Parliament because no legislation has been proposed. 
 
¶3. The Status of the Development and Implementation of the 
Visa Information System, Including its Biometric Components. 
The European Visa Information System (VIS) is planned to be 
fully operational in 2012, and will be used in consular 
sections and border crossing points.  The system will use 
biometrics (both facial images and fingerprints) to verify 
the authenticity of both the visa and its holder.  The 
European Parliament and the European Council adopted an EC 
regulation on the VIS in early 2008. 
 
¶4. Schengen Information System II.  The implementation of the 
Schengen Information System II (SIS II) has been postponed 
until September 2009.  This system will include information 
on persons who are wanted for an arrest, third-country 
nationals who should be refused entry to the EU, missing 
persons, witnesses, persons required to appear before 
judicial authorities, persons or vehicles put under 
surveillance, and certain stolen, or lost objects such as 
vehicles, firearms, identity documents, or bank notes.  SIS 
II will include the full name (including aliases), physical 
characteristics, place and date of birth, sex, photographs, 
fingerprints, nationality(ies), whether the person is 
considered armed or dangerous, reason for alert, and a 
reference to the decision giving rise to the alert. 
The SIS II system will be connected to national SIS systems 
and be able to interface between the national systems.  In 
addition, the system will provide an encrypted virtual 
network for the exchange of data between member state 
authorities. 
 
¶5. Per requests in reftel, Post is continuing to research the 
status of European Union consideration of an entry/exit 
system and the relationship between the improved SIS II and 
the handling and tracking of student visa holders.
