FOLLOWING MASSIVE RE-ELECTION VICTORY

¶1.  SUMMARY:  Premier Danny Williams is planning on a new round 
of fighting with Ottawa over resource revenues now that he and 
his Tory party have scored a massive victory in the October 9 
Newfoundland-Labrador election.  The Tories took 43 of the 48 
seats up for grabs, the Liberals 3 and the NDP 1, while one 
district is still undecided.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  Voters in Newfoundland-Labrador have given Premier Danny 
Williams and his Tory party an overwhelming vote of confidence 
in the October 9 provincial election (reftels).  As soon as the 
vote counting got underway, it was obvious that the Tories had 
swept the province, taking 43 of the 48 seats in the House of 
Assembly, including eight of the 11 seats the Liberals had held 
previously.  One of the eight belonged to Gerry Reid, the 
Liberal Opposition leader who said he is prepared to stay on as 
leader if the party still wants him.  As expected NDP leader 
Lorraine Michael held on to her party's only seat in the House, 
but the NDP failed to gain any new seats. (The final tally will 
not be known until November 6 when there will be a special vote 
in one district where one of the candidates died just prior to 
the election.) 
 
¶3.  COMMENT:  Polling throughout Williams's first term in office 
had always indicated that that the popular premier would have an 
easy time in his re-election bid.  However, not even Williams 
himself could have predicted a 70 percent approval rating, which 
historians say is the largest since Newfoundland-Labrador joined 
Confederation in 1949.  Given his highly successful re-election 
campaign, Williams is using his ringing endorsement to launch 
another round of fighting with Prime Minister Harper over 
offshore oil and gas revenue sharing.  The premier took 
advantage of the national media attention on October 9 to warn 
the PM that he was going to have to take on the entire province 
if he didn't back down from changes to the existing revenue 
sharing formula.  That move spells more strife ahead in the 
coming months, but for now Williams is savoring his victory and 
laying the groundwork for mandate number-two.  As for the 
Liberals, they are left pondering their future in a province 
where the voters are in almost total agreement that their 
Premier is indeed their staunchest defender.  END COMMENT
