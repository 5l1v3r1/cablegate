¶1. (SBU) Poloff discussed reftel with Foreign Affairs Deputy 
Director for Iran and Iraq Jeffrey McLaren on October 28. 
McLaren concurred with the points in our non-paper.  He said 
that upon learning of Ahmadi-Nejad's remarks on October 26, 
Assistant Deputy Minister David Mulroney immediately brought 
in the Iranian Charge d'Affaires, Abbas Assemi, to convey 
Canada's outrage.  Apparently, Assemi was "completely 
unaware" of Ahmadi-Nejad's speech, though he said he would 
report Canada's reaction to Tehran. 
 
¶2. (U) Foreign Minister Pettigrew vigorously condemned the 
extremist statements of the Iranian President regarding 
Israel in the following statement issued October 26: 
 
"On behalf of all Canadians, I want to vigorously condemn the 
remarks made by Iran's President.  We are in the 21st 
century.  Canada will never accept such hatred, intolerance 
and anti-Semitism.  Never. 
 
We believe that this extreme view does not reflect the 
opinion of the Iranian people. 
 
The comments are all the more troubling given Iran's nuclear 
ambitions and its refusal to cooperate fully with 
International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors.  This refusal 
underlines the need for all countries to stand together to 
ensure that Iran is prevented from developing nuclear 
weaponry.   In fact, during her recent visit to Ottawa, U.S. 
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and I discussed how to 
 
SIPDIS 
address nuclear proliferation in Iran, including the 
possibility that the UN Security Council may have to send a 
strong message." 
 
¶3. (U) Prime Minister Martin reiterated Canada's condemnation 
of Ahmadi-Nejad's remarks in the House of Commons on October 
¶27.
