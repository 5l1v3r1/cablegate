Summary 
 
------------ 
 
¶1.      (U)  Governor Sir Richard Gozney reconvened Parliament 
on November 6 and delivered the Throne Speech setting out the 
Government of Bermuda's (GOB) legislative agenda for the coming 
year.  Speaking on behalf of the government, the Governor put 
the spotlight on education and youth and the need to prepare 
them to be successful members of society.  He also proposed 
finding a modern solution to address racial discrimination and 
suggested unspecified amendments to the Human Rights Act that 
would prevent discrimination of "any person."  The speech noted 
the GOB would create an office to assist Bermudians denied entry 
into the United States to obtain waivers, as well as draft 
amendments that would implement some of the recommendations of 
the International Monetary Fund.  The speech also touched on 
examining gaming as a way to invigorate the declining tourism 
industry.  It was notable for its brevity and its "do-able" 
focus on the socio-economic issues that most affect the 
Bermudian public, but glossed over plans to revive the economy. 
End summary. 
 
 
 
Preparing All Youth for the Future 
 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.      (U)  The government led off with initiatives to reform 
public education, with an emphasis on at-risk students.  Citing 
a new study that revealed that more than 50 percent of black 
male students leave the school system before graduation, the 
speech proposed measures to strengthen the assessment of at-risk 
students, implement specialized instruction for boys, and 
improve school counseling. On the subject of education 
generally, the speech noted that the adoption of the Cambridge 
International Curriculum will provide international recognition 
for Bermuda's diploma and will also require the certification of 
teachers to meet its more rigorous standards. 
 
 
 
Addressing Human Rights Issues 
 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.      (U)  The speech called for a thorough review of the 
Commission on Unity and Racial Equality to address racial 
discrimination, noting that the lack of progress in this area 
requires a new, modern vehicle to address historical racial 
inequities.  In addition, the speech noted that the GOB will 
amend the Human Rights Act to prevent discrimination of any 
person.  In the short time since the speech, the question of 
whether the government will include discrimination based on 
sexual orientation has again gained prominence. 
 
 
 
Helping Bermudians with Criminal Records Travel to the US 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
---------------- 
 
¶4.      (U)  The speech promised the creation of a "Visa Waiver 
Assistance Program" to encourage Bermudians "to stay off the 
list of prohibited persons and moreover provide assistance to 
those requiring visas to enter our nearest neighbouring country, 
the United States."  On November 7, the daily Royal Gazette 
quoted the Consul General as saying, "The U.S. Consulate 
welcomes the Premier's announcement in today's Throne Speech 
about opening an office to assist Bermudians to apply for 
waivers of ineligibilities.  The Consulate endorses his 
initiative, which will pass the message, especially among 
Bermuda's youth, that the consequences of illegal activity are 
life-long.  We look forward to working with this new office." 
 
 
 
Settling the Gambling Issue Once and For All 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶5.      (U)  The speech addressed the contentious proposal of 
gambling as a way to bolster the faltering tourism industry. 
Unlike the Premier's failed end run around his backbench to pass 
a cruise ship gaming bill in July, the GOB will introduce a 
 
HAMILTON 00000132  002.3 OF 002 
 
 
formal discussion paper on gaming that will promote a thorough 
debate based on "dispassionate research."  The debate, if 
positive, could lead to a new policy statement followed by the 
introduction of enabling legislation.  The legalization of 
gambling is a very controversial subject in Bermuda, widely 
opposed by the religious groups, but having the strong support 
of Premier Brown - who is also Tourism Minister. 
 
 
 
Implementing International Monetary Fund (IMF) Recommendations 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
------------------------- 
 
¶6.      (U)  Following up on recommendations made to Bermuda by 
the IMF in 2008, the GOB will introduce amendments to the Banks 
and Deposit Companies Act to strengthen the intervention powers 
of the Bermuda Monetary Authority in the case of troubled banks. 
 
 
 
Glossing Over the Economy? 
 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶7.      (U)  In a November 9 editorial, the Royal Gazette 
complained that the speech lacked boldness and was to some 
extent misleading.  It pointed out the speech's "astonishingly 
upbeat assessment on the economy, especially given the almost 
weekly news of job losses and the gloomy outlook." The critique 
also noted that the speech lacks "almost any indication of how 
Government plans to revive the economy." 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
------------ 
 
(SUB)  The Premier had promised a "bold" speech; however, this 
was anything but.  Instead, the government hit the top issues of 
the day:  education and health, while skimming over potential 
economic problems.  Clocking in at less than twenty minutes, the 
government mentioned a number of initiatives it plans for the 
next year, without providing much detail.  This could likely be 
because the government is still debating these policy issues.SHELTON
