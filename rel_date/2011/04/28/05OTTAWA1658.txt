NOMINATING-OFFICER: Field Rep Betty Rice 
START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Carmen Moore is ConGen Calgary's link to the Great White 
North.  Ms. Moore has offered useful insights into the 
northern psyche, in connection with Consulate initiatives 
such as the Virtual Presence Posts or cultural programming 
in the most distinct area of the consular district. 
The post proposes an individual program to help Carmen 
better understand U.S. attitudes and thinking,  federalism; 
the relationship between and among cities, states, and the 
federal government; and American culture and society.  In 
sharing the information she gains with Northwest Territory 
colleagues, she will help advance the Mission's goal of 
strengthening ties with Canadians in Canada's remote north.
