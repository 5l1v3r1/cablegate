SUBJECT: SUPPORTING ARGENTINA'S REQUEST FOR INTERPOL 
APPROVAL OF RED NOTICES 
 
REF: SECSTATE 147320 
 
Classified By: Pol/Econ Counselor Margaret McKean; Reason:  1.4 (b) and 
 (d) 
 
 ¶1.  (C)  In response to reftel demarche, Pol/Econ Counselor 
spoke with an Argentine Embassy official, who related that 
the Government of Argentina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had 
discussed the issue of the red notices with the New Zealand 
Embassy in Buenos Aires.  The Argentine Embassy in Wellington 
was unaware that its government had asked the USG or any 
other foreign mission to support its position, but they did 
not have any objections if the U.S. mission weighed in.  In 
discussion with the French DCM, Pol/Econ Counselor learned 
that he had not been asked by Paris to assist.  The U.S. 
Embassy did ascertain that the GNZ would be represented at 
the Interpol General Assembly meeting, but that the New 
Zealand position on this issue would be determined in Morocco 
based on their representative's discussions with colleagues 
at the GA and the dynamic established during the meeting. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Pol/Econ Counselor met on October 31 with MFAT 
Director of the Americas Division, Carl Worker, to deliver 
the demarche.  Worker confirmed that the New Zealand Embassy 
had been approached by the Government of Argentina.  Worker 
noted that the GNZ sense was to be supportive in this 
situation.  Nevertheless, as a former ambassador to 
Argentina, Worker said that the Argentine judiciary and 
police investigations in general leave much to be desired; 
however, he understood that the Argentine government was 
trying to make a proper case in this instance.  He asked if 
the USG had information bearing on the investigation and its 
quality; Pol/Econ Counselor responded that such information 
had not been included in the demarche request.
