REF: STATE 112981 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  According to Deputy Director of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) Division for 
Inter-American Relations Leonard Beaulne, Canada will give 
"strong consideration" to the U.S. candidate for the 
Inter-American Commission of Women's (CIM) Executive 
Committee.  He commented that a number of DFAIT decisions 
have been on hold pending the recent Canadian election and 
formation of a new government; new Foreign Minister Lawrence 
Cannon took office only on October 30. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Clare Bekton, Coordinator in DFAIT's Office for the 
Status of Women, will likely lead the Canadian delegation to 
the CIM Assembly of Delegates in Santiago, Chile from 
November 10-12, Beaulne added.
