¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel, Econoff met with Outdoor Brands 
Managing Director Andy Mercer on September 28 to check the bona 
fides of the company and its annual sales.   The company is a 
legally registered company in New Zealand and has the necessary New 
Zealand permits to legally import and sell firearms.   Econoff 
witnessed a current business license, valid Notice of Importation 
of Firearms/Restricted Weapons/Parts issued by the New Zealand 
Police (Permit Number LVSC/9910), and valid permit to sell firearms 
in New Zealand (Dealer License T1547932, issued 17 October, 2008). 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The company was established in September 2008, and the 
main shareholder and director is Andy Mercer (age 42), who is a 
citizen of New Zealand.  The company has 3 employees, one of which 
is Mercer's wife.  According to Mercer, the company is a wholesaler 
of sporting goods to approximately 120 sporting goods shops located 
throughout New Zealand.  It does not sell to any companies outside 
of New Zealand.  The company imports sporting goods including 
firearms and spare parts, ammunition, clothing and equipment from 
several different countries, including China, and sells them 
throughout New Zealand on a wholesale basis only.   Most of the end 
users are located in rural areas of New Zealand.   Mercer said 
that, according to New Zealand law, he checks the firearms sales 
licenses and business licenses for each of the retail outlets that 
purchase his products.  According to Mercer, the company's annual 
sales of U.S.-origin firearms, which accounts for the bulk of the 
business, totals NZD 2.5 million (approximately USD  1.75 million). 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Mercer confirmed that he fully understood the regulations 
governing the import of U.S.-origin defense articles, including 
restrictions on re-transfer or re-export.  To the best of Mercer's 
knowledge, no firearms that were imported through his company have 
been re-exported. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Outdoor Brands, located at 6 Botha Road in Auckland, is 
situated in a commercial/industrial area in the suburban area of 
Penrose.   It is in an unmarked building, which Mercer explained is 
for security purposes.   The imported firearms are stored on-site 
in a locked shipping container, which is inside a concrete 
building.   The building has iron-barred windows and reinforced 
locks.   The building also has an alarm system that is monitored 
off-site by a security company.   Econoff personally witnessed the 
aforementioned security measures.   According to Mercer, Police are 
dispatched immediately (because of the sensitive nature of the 
warehouse) if alarms are tripped and there is no immediate response 
from company employees. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) There was nothing during the meeting or tour of the 
facility that would lead us to question the reliability of Outdoor 
Brands.  Andy Mercer and his employees were very open and 
cooperative during the visit.  It appeared that Outdoor Brands has 
taken all prudent measures to secure the firearms.  Mercer 
explained that although licenses 050130278 and 050181912 are for 
relatively large amounts of firearms, the company only imports a 
small percentage.   He said the biggest issue he faces is the 
unavailability of firearms he would like to purchase from the U.S. 
He showed one recent order in which only 36 of the 746 ordered 
rifles were available. 
 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  Hunting is a very popular year-round sport in 
New Zealand with no limits on what New Zealand considers "invasive 
species" of rabbits, possums, wild pigs, and deer.   The peak sales 
season for rifles occurs in April, during the fall migratory season 
and from October to December during the run-up to Christmas. 
Mercer's business model and sales patterns were consistent with 
hunting norms in New Zealand.
