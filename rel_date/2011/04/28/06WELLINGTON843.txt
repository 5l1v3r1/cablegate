¶1.  (SBU) PE Couns shared reftel demarche on the 2006 
Convention on Conventional Weapons Review Conference with 
Caroline McDonald, Director of the Disarmament Division at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  McDonald 
said that New Zealand is supportive of a strong, 
legally-binding protocol on Anti-Vehicle Mines, and would 
study our points carefully. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) McDonald also sent PE Couns a copy of New Zealand's 
statement at the thematic debate on conventional weapons at 
the UNGA 61 First Committee. The statement says New Zealand 
would welcome the conclusion of an instrument on mines other 
than anti-personnel mines, if a legally binding text could be 
agreed that made a credible improvement on existing 
humanitarian law provisions.  The statement says that GNZ 
"does not see that this requirement could be satisfied by the 
conclusion of a text which carried optional provisions on the 
key issues of detectability and active life."
