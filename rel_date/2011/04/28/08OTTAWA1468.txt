SUBJECT: TWO NEW CONVICTIONS UNDER CANADA'S SEX TOURISM LAW 
 
¶1. (U) Summary.  Canada secured two new sex tourism convictions in 
November under Criminal Code amendments that now permit police to 
charge Canadians for sex crimes against children overseas.  At least 
one other case in is the works for alleged abuses in Cambodia, 
Colombia, and the Philippines.  End Summary. 
 
GUILTY 
------ 
 
¶2. (U) Quebec police arrested Canadian former aid workers Denis 
Rochefort and Armand Huard in Quebec City in February on charges of 
abusing boys in an orphanage in Les Cayes, Haiti between December 
2006 and March 2007.  Rochefort pled guilty on November 14 to sexual 
assault charges against six Haitian minors and received a two year 
jail sentence, followed by three years of probation.  On November 
17, Huard pled guilty to ten counts of sexual assault of eight minor 
Haitian children and received a three year jail sentence. 
 
EXPANDING COVERAGE 
------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) Parliament enacted child sex tourism amendments to the 
Criminal Code that came into force in May 1997 and July 2002.  The 
provisions now allow police to arrest and prosecute Canadians in 
Canada for sexual offences against children in foreign countries in 
cases in which the foreign state where an offence allegedly occurred 
does not prosecute an accused Canadian.  The charges carry a maximum 
penalty of 14 years imprisonment. The authority to arrest and 
prosecute cases falls within provincial (not federal) jurisdiction. 
¶4. (U) The latest convictions bring the total number of 
extraterritorial child sex tourism convictions in Canada to three. 
Donald Bakker, the first Canadian charged under the revised law, 
pled guilty in 2005 and received a ten year prison sentence for 
sexually abusing children in Cambodia.  Police in British Columbia 
have also laid charges against Kenneth Robert Klassen for child sex 
crimes in Cambodia, Colombia, and the Philippines, but that case has 
not yet gone to trial.
