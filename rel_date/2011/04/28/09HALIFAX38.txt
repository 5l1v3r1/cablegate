COMPLETION AT CALAIS-ST. STEPHEN 
 
REF: (A) 08 HALIFAX 0035; (B) 07 HALIFAX 0012 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: Although construction of the new U.S. Land Port of 
Entry (LPOE) at Calais, Maine is running slightly ahead of 
schedule, and the new international bridge and Canadian LPOE are 
nearly complete, USG officials continue to maintain the public 
position that the opening of the new border crossing will occur 
"by November." Given the thirty plus years of waiting that they 
have endured, it's not surprising that there is great 
anticipation among the local citizenry on both sides of the 
border to having the new bridge and border crossing open for 
business. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. While traveling to the border on June 1 to witness and report 
on the first day of implementing the land and sea rule of the 
Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, we took the opportunity to 
revisit the site of the new U.S. LPOE at Calais, Maine. 
Construction crews on both sides of the border have made great 
progress since our earlier visits (REFTELS). According to the 
resident superintendant for the construction management firm 
supervising the LPOE project, construction of the new U.S. LPOE 
is currently running slightly ahead of schedule. If they are 
able to continue at the current pace, he expects to be able to 
sign over the completed project in September. 
 
¶3. The new Canadian LPOE is basically finished and awaiting 
staffing by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA). The 
contractor working for Maine Department of Transportation (MDOT) 
is putting the finishing touches on the new international bridge 
spanning the St. Croix River. On both sides of the border the 
new and/or improved highways leading to the new U.S. and 
Canadian LPOEs are ready. U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) and CBSA have each hired and are now training about forty 
new officers in preparation for operating their respective new 
LPOEs. 
 
¶4. Even though the new international bridge is still an active 
MDOT construction site (hard hats definitely required), Canadian 
authorities granted us permission to enter Canada by way of the 
bridge, which we crossed on foot along with the CBSA Director 
for southern New Brunswick. We were met on the Canadian side by 
a uniformed CBSA officer who dutifully checked our passports 
before admitting us to Canada and then locked the construction 
gate behind us. In contrast to the ultra-modern design of the 
U.S. LPOE, the design of the Canadian LPOE draws on Canada's 
railroad heritage, with massive, hand carved wooden pews and 
heavy oak countertops in the public areas. 
 
¶5. COMMENT: The new international bridge--which locals have been 
waiting on for over thirty years--and the new Canadian and U.S. 
LPOE facilities (with their NEXUS lanes) will help solve the 
traffic congestion problems in downtown Calais and St. Stephen. 
These modern, LEED compliant, state-of-the-art passenger and 
commercial traffic handling facilities will certainly help 
solidify Calais-St. Stephen's standing as one of the busiest 
land border crossings in northeastern North America. END COMMENT.
