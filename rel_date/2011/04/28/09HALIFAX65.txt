¶1. SUMMARY:  Political leaders from New England and Eastern 
Canada gathered in Saint John New Brunswick September 13-15 to 
discuss topics such as cross-border energy, the environment, 
opportunities within the green economy, trade and pandemic 
preparedness.  Despite the geniality among the governors and 
premiers in this their 33rd annual meeting, a contentious issue 
between Maine and New Brunswick over proposed LNG plants caused 
some friction outside the meeting room.  The State of 
Massachusetts will host the meeting next year, although the 
Governors and Premiers have not decided on a date or location in 
the state.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
 
¶2.  The New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers 
(NEG/ECP) held their 33rd annual meeting in Saint John, New 
Brunswick, September 13-15.  All five of the Premiers attended, 
joined by three of the six New England Governors (two of the 
governors sent representatives). Also in attendance were 
Canadian Consul General Neil LeBlanc of Boston and AmEmb Ottawa 
Economic Minister Counselor Eric Benjaminson although neither 
had an official role in the program.  The theme of the meeting, 
co-chaired by New Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham and Maine 
Governor John Baldacci, was "Close Collaboration - Stronger 
Economies".  Consistent with that theme, the agenda focused on 
topics that reflected the now traditional areas where the 
NEG/ECP have a long history of collaborative achievements: 
energy, the environment, opportunities in the new green economy, 
trade and a relatively new topic, pandemic preparedness.  In all 
the leaders concluded their discussions by passing several 
resolutions on these topics.  Complete texts of the documents 
are available online at: www.scics.gc.ca/confer09_e.html. 
 
 
 
¶3.  Notable highlights of the resolutions include: 
 
 
 
--The Green Economy:  Speakers from the private sector told the 
NEG/ECP of the significant opportunities in new technologies and 
clean energy which prompted the leaders to make a commitment to 
foster a transition to the green economy in their own 
jurisdictions.  (FYI:  The Governors and Premiers also made a 
favorable reference to President Obama's commitment to this same 
issue. END FYI) 
 
 
 
--Renewable energy:  The leaders resolved to urge their 
respective federal leaders to recognize hydroelectricity as a 
renewable energy source, a move especially welcomed by hydro 
power producers Quebec and Newfoundland-Labrador.  Tied in with 
the corresponding resolution on the green economy, the NEG/ECP 
also acknowledged that greenhouse gas reduction targets will 
spur opportunities for developing cost-effective, renewable 
energy resources. 
 
 
 
--Climate Change:  The NEG/ECP also highlighted the progress 
made by the cross-border Climate Change Steering Committee and 
especially how that was significant given the upcoming U.N. 
meeting on climate change in Copenhagen. 
 
 
 
--Energy Efficiency:  The Governors and Premiers called on their 
federal leaders to help promote and fund energy efficiency 
programs that address climate change, specifically mentioning 
the "cap and trade" system. 
 
 
 
--Pandemic Preparedness: For the past 10 years the NEG/ECP has 
fostered mutual assistance among their respective jurisdictions 
in managing disasters and emergencies.  The leaders pledged they 
would use this same cooperative resource in preparing for any 
widespread outbreaks of the H1N1 virus. 
 
--Open and Secure Trade: The NEG/ECP resolved to promote open 
trade policies within the region, recognizing the importance of 
trade to their respective economies. 
 
¶4.  Responsibility for hosting the NEG/ECP meetings rotates 
among the jurisdictions, and next in line to play host for the 
34th meeting in 2010 is the State of Massachusetts.  However, 
the leaders have not decided on a specific place in 
Massachusetts or the date.  (One of the factors is when New 
 
HALIFAX 00000065  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Brunswick Premier Shawn Graham will make his re-election bid 
which is predicted to be some time in 2010. 
 
¶6.  COMMENT:  Although the governors and premiers were quick to 
praise their longstanding cooperative work in critical areas, 
behind the scenes there are inevitable issues that arise between 
jurisdictions as is the current case between New Brunswick and 
Maine. American investors want to build two liquefied natural 
gas (LNG) terminals on the Maine shores of Passamaquoddy Bay 
across from New Brunswick.  Because of local opposition, the 
governments of New Brunswick and Canada oppose the projects, and 
Canada has also asserted that it can bar LNG tankers from 
transiting Canada's Head Harbor Passage, the only way to reach 
Passamaquoddy Bay.  Maine is upset by these assertions, and as 
emphasized to Econ Min-Counselor by the Governor himself, is 
emphatic in wanting to see the plants get built because of the 
boost they would give to an economically depressed area of the 
state.  Notwithstanding the strong rhetoric on both sides on 
this issue, it failed to overshadow the event or dampen the 
participants' enthusiasm.  In all the NEG/ECP meeting once again 
lived up to its billing as an effective tool in cross-border 
relations.  END COMMENT
