CIV-MIL CELL DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 99182 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade Senior (DFAIT) Adviser for Afghanistan Policy and 
Advocacy David Fairchild expressed appreciation for reftel 
demarche of September 17, noting that the current version 
appeared to have taken into consideration earlier Canadian 
concerns.  He observed that the proposed Regional Command - 
South (RC-S) Civilian-Military Cell is "critically important" 
to Canada, and promised a cleared, inter-agency reaction 
before October 1 despite the government's current "caretaker 
status" in advance of the upcoming October 14 federal 
election.
