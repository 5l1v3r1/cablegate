¶1. (U) Summary: Two recently released reports make it difficult to 
judge exactly how close Ontario is to its goal of phasing out 
shipments of municipal trash to Michigan by the end of 2010.  A 40% 
reduction by 2009 was set as an interim target.  According to U.S. 
media reports, the reductions appear to fall short of the agreement. 
 By contrast, Ontario officials from the Ministry of the Environment 
tell us they are confident Ontario is on its way to meeting its 
goal.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------ 
2006 Waste Reduction Agreement 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Michigan and Ontario leaders struck a deal in 2006 which 
obligated the province to phase out shipments of municipal solid 
waste (MSW) to Michigan by the end of 2010.  The regional 
municipalities in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) -- York, Peel, and 
Durham, and the City of Toronto - were to reduce MSW shipments by 
20% in 2007, and by another 20% by the end of 2008, based on actual 
amounts shipped in 2005.  In return, Michigan's Senators agreed not 
to pursue amendments to the Homeland Security Appropriation Bill (SA 
4657 and SA 4617), or to pursue similar future measures that would 
allow states to prohibit the importation of MSW.  The 2006 agreement 
did not cover industrial, commercial, and institutional (ICI) waste 
shipments to Michigan from the province, primarily from 
non-municipally-managed sources. 
 
----------- 
The Reports 
----------- 
 
¶3. (U) The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) 
reported on January 30 that Ontario sent about 2% less trash to 
state landfills in fiscal 2008, ending September 30, compared with a 
year earlier.  Canadian trash coming into Michigan has dropped more 
than 11% since peaking in 2006.  Ontario shipped 10.7 million cubic 
yards of trash to Michigan in 2008 (nearly 19% of the state's 57.1 
million cubic-yard total imported MSW). 
¶4. (U) Conversely, according to a report released on January 30 by 
Toronto city officials, Toronto has cut trash loads to Michigan by 
50% over the last five years.  All five GTA municipalities together 
reduced their 2007 MSW shipments to within 1% of the agreed upon 
target.  While final numbers for 2008 are not yet available, the 
number of tractor trailers hauling Toronto's MSW to Michigan has 
dropped from 140 in 2003 to about 70 each day, according to the 
city.  Additional unspecified truckloads come from the other GTA 
municipalities. 
--------------- 
Waste Diversion 
--------------- 
¶5. (U) Approximately 60% of Toronto's waste reduction reportedly is 
a result of individual household and industrial waste diversion. 
People are recycling more in large part because of increased fees 
imposed by the city of Toronto.  When Toronto began its waste 
shipments to Michigan in 1998, 30 truckloads a day crossed the 
border.  That number grew when Toronto's only active landfill closed 
and Michigan became Toronto's primary landfill site.  When the 
Michigan contract expires in 2010, Toronto's remaining solid waste 
will be sent to the Green Lane and Warwick landfill sites in 
southwestern Ontario.  Waste will also be diverted through 
composting and biomass conversion to electricity and other energy 
sources, as well as other measures. Other GTA municipalities have 
switched to landfill sites in their regions, within the province and 
the Provincial government has authorized the expansion of several 
landfills located within the province. 
¶6.  (SBU) While at first glance the Michigan and Toronto reports 
seem contradictory, their reporting methodologies are different. 
Michigan's numbers cover the state's fiscal year-end, ending 
September 30, while Toronto's numbers represent the calendar year, 
ending December 31.  Toronto's report includes only MSW collected by 
the five GTA municipalities; the Michigan report counts all waste 
from Canada, including ICI.  Finally, a completely accurate 
comparison would factor the difference between cubic yards and 
metric tons. 
 
¶7. (SBU) While Ontario provincial officials are confident that the 
agreement is being honored and have assured us that their 
counterpart U.S. officials are satisfied with the progress, we have 
not heard from any Michigan officials.  The final test may be 
whether an attempt to legally proscribe trash shipments is 
re-introduced by Michigan's representatives.
