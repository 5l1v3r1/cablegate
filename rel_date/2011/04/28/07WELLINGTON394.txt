SUBJECT: NZDF TO PROVIDE P-3 ORION TO PSI EXERCISE 
 
Classified By: ACTING DCM KATHERINE B. HADDA, 
FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) NZDF Director of International Defence Relations Wayne 
Higgins told Emboffs today that Chief of Defence Force 
Mataparae has approved an NZDF P-3 Orion's participation in a 
regional, Operations Expert Group (OEG)-led PSI exercise, to 
be held in Japan October 15-18.  The decision was made 
following a request from Japan.  Higgins said that it would 
be a struggle for NZDF to contribute the plane given the 
Orion upgrades now underway, but when Japan stepped up to 
host the exercise the GNZ wanted to offer support.  He added 
that NZDF gives priority to contributing assets to regional 
PSI exercises, given that New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and 
Singapore are the only Asia-Pacific regional OEG members. 
 
¶2.  (C) Higgins said NZDF is informing the Embassy of the 
decision now in order to give the USG ample time to process 
any necessary waivers for U.S. participation in the exercise. 
 They will also pass this information to U.S. officials 
through the NZ Embassy in Washington.
