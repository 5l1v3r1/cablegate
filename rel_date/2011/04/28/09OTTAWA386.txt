¶1. (SBU) ESTH counselor discussed U.S. thinking and planning 
on funding for climate adaptation with John Moffet, Director 
General of Environment Canada,s International Climate Change 
Office, and inquired about Canada,s own assistance efforts 
for adaptation and planning for future assistance.  Moffet 
advised that discussions on funding international climate 
change assistance, including support for adaptation, were 
ongoing, and that officials had already had detailed 
discussions with the Environment Minister on options and 
opportunities.  While no concrete decisions had been taken, 
Moffet believed the minister favored increased funding for 
climate assistance and had already been &priming the 
Cabinet8 for consideration of specific proposals. 
 
¶2. (U) Moffet undertook to provide information on how much 
Canada has committed to bilateral adaptation-related 
development aid, but those figures are not likely to be 
available before COB May 22.  Through its Climate Change 
Development Fund, Canada committed $100 million to assistance 
for climate-related activities more broadly, including 
adaptation, between 2000 and 2006.
