SUBJECT: CANADA LOOKS FORWARD TO SINGAPORE PSI EXERCISE, 
CONSIDERING LEADING EDGE 
 
REF: STATE 84305 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Canada is looking forward to its participation in 
the October Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) exercise 
"Deep Sabre" in Singapore, according to Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) International 
Counter-Proliferation Senior Policy Officer David MacDuff. 
He added that a Royal Canadian Mounted Police boarding team 
will demonstrate Canada's marine interdiction capabilities at 
Deep Sabre.  In light of Canada's participation in the 
Singapore exercise, he commented that it was "unlikely that 
Canada would participate in more than one PSI event per 
cycle."  Nonetheless, he underlined that Canada appreciates 
the ref invitation and had forwarded it to counterparts at 
the Department of National Defence, who are currently 
studying it.
