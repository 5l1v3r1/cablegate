SUBJECT: SEVENTH CONVICTION IN "TORONTO 18" PLOT 
 
¶1. (U) Thirty-four-year-old Shareef Abdelhaleem was found guilty on 
January 21 of participating in the "Toronto 18" terror plots. 
Abdelhaleem was found guilty of knowingly participating in a 
terrorist group and intending to cause an explosion that was likely 
to cause serious bodily harm or death.  However, his defense 
counsel plans to file a motion arguing entrapment.  Because of the 
pending entrapment motion, sentencing has not been scheduled. 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) Since the initial arrests of 18 Toronto-area men in 2006 for 
a plot to carry out terrorist attacks in Southern Ontario to 
protest Canada's military presence in Afghanistan, the following 
have been convicted: 
 
 
 
a) Nishanthan Yogakrishnan, 21, was convicted in September 2008 and 
sentenced to 30 months on May 22.  Given credit for time served, he 
has already been released; 
 
b) Amin Mohamed Durrani, 23, pled guilty on January 20 and was 
sentenced to 7.5 years in prison.  Given credit for time served, 
after serving an additional day following his conviction, he has 
already been released; 
 
c) Ali Mohamed Dirie, 26, pled guilty on September 21, 2009 to 
participating in the activities of a terrorist group; he received a 
seven-year sentence and will receive double credit for time in 
pretrial detention, thus making him eligible for release in 
November 2010 under current law; 
 
d) Saad Gaya, 21, pled guilty on September 28, 2009 and was 
sentenced to 12 years; 
 
e) Saad Khalid, 23, was sentenced to 14 years in prison on 
September 4, 2009; 
 
f) Zakaria Amara, 23, pled guilty on October 8, 2009 and was 
sentenced on January 18 to life in prison; 
 
g) Shareef Abdelhaleem, 34, was found guilty on January 21.   He 
has not yet been sentenced. 
 
 
 
Of the remaining members of the "Toronto 18" terror plot arrested 
in 2006, four face trial in March.  They cannot be identified due 
to an ongoing publication ban.  Charges against the other seven 
members were either stayed or dismissed.
