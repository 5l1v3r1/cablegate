¶1. (U) On May 6 Econoff delivered reftel points to Doug 
George, Director, Intellectual Property, Information and 
Technology Trade Policy Division, Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade.  George (protect) said 
Canada shares the USG's concern regarding the upcoming WIPO 
DG election.  Canada believes that the ideal DG candidate 
needs to have significant relevant experience, be well 
respected in the IP community, and have a clear vision for 
the direction of WIPO.  He explained that the current 
situation is a critical time for WIPO and if the election 
"goes the wrong way, it might not be possible to recover." 
 
¶2. (SBU) George's office has advised the Minister of 
International Trade that it has four "preferred" candidates 
and that the other candidates are either "acceptable" or 
"unacceptable."  The Minister has not yet decided which 
candidate Canada will support.  George said there is 
"significant overlap" between Canada's four preferred 
candidates and the USG's five recommended candidates. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The candidates that currently have the most support, 
George believes, are Australia's Dr. Gurry, Japan's Yo 
Takago, and Pakistan's Ambassador Khan.  George said that the 
amount of support that he sees for Ambassador Khan is 
particularly troubling.  Khan is not a preferred candidate or 
an acceptable candidate to Canada. 
 
¶4. (SBU) George believes that any candidate who can not speak 
English or does not have credibility within the IP community 
will likely be eliminated very quickly from the DG race. 
George said that he is not impressed by Enrique Manalo, the 
candidate from the Philippines or Dr. Gjorgji Filipov, the 
candidate from Macedonia.  He also commented that he does not 
believe that Dr. Bojan Pretnar of Slovenia has much support 
and is surprised that he is on the U.S. recommended list.
