SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 05-050103333 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests AIT Taipei's and Post's 
assistance in conducting a pre-license check on application 
05-050103333 for the export of defense hardware to Taiwan. 
It is requested that you complete this Blue Lantern inquiry 
within 30 days.  Lack of response to a Blue Lantern inquiry 
will affect pending and future licenses involving parties to 
this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Unable to verify bona fides of foreign 
consignee, Junsdom Solutions, in proposed transaction. 
Open-source information indicates that it may be based in 
mainland China. 
 
¶4. Action AIT Taipei: Department requests that AIT Taipei 
contact Chung Shan Institute of Technology and determine 
whether that entity placed an order for the items listed 
below for the purpose stated on the application. If so, 
determine whether any other Taiwan-based firm is involved in 
the procurement of the items. Remind the end-user that 
the unauthorized re-export or retransfer of United States 
Munitions List (USML) items is strictly prohibited. 
 
Action Ottawa: Department requests that Post establish the 
bona fides of foreign consignee Junsdom Solutions Co. Ltd as 
a responsible recipient of USML items.  Conduct a site visit 
to assess the company's reliability as a recipient of USML 
articles, and assess its operations and on-site security. 
Emphasize that the unauthorized re-export or retransfer of 
USML items is strictly prohibited. 
 
The following questions provide suggested guidance: 
 
 (To Junsdom Solutions Co., Ltd.) 
 
 - Please confirm an order to be shipped under license 
05-050103333. 
 
 - How long has your company been in the business of 
importing and selling defense articles? What other products 
are sold by your company? Does your company do business (or 
has it done business) under any other names? 
 
 - Does your company conduct business involving USML articles 
with any countries besides Taiwan? If so, where?  If your 
company has offices overseas, where are they located? 
 
 - Are you familiar with the restrictions against the 
unauthorized re-export or retransfer of U.S.-origin defense 
articles? 
 
End Action Request.
