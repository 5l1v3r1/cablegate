SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON THE EXPORT OF U.S. DEFENSE ARTICLES CITING THE CANADIAN 
EXEMPTION 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on transactions citing the 
Canadian exemption (part 126.5 of the International Traffic 
in Arms Regulations - ITAR) for the export of electronic 
component parts to Canada.  Embassy is requested to complete 
this Blue Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to 
a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: end-user Ensil International appears 
on the DTCC Watchlist; also vague/incomplete description of 
commodity and end-use in export filing; the Automated Export 
System (AES) filing data indicates exports of electronic 
component parts while the United States Munitions List (USML) 
category cited indicates aircraft and/or related component 
parts.  The company has not previously been the subject of a 
Blue Lantern. 
 
¶4. ACTION OTTAWA: Mission Canada is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate officials to establish the bona 
fides of end-user Ensil International and to obtain all 
relevant details of the export of electronic component parts 
to Canada citing the Canadian exemption, including the exact 
description, number, type, dollar value, and serial number of 
items.  PM/DTCC also requests that post conducts a site visit 
to the company in order to provide Department with an 
assessment of its business operations and on-site security. 
Finally, post is asked to assess whether the company appears 
to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If a site visit is 
not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--What were the exact USML articles exported to you? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for these USML items?  Will Ensil 
International retain positive control over the electronic 
component parts at all times?  Will they be transferred to 
other end-users in Canada or re-exported? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of the company's business?  Have they 
previously sought defense articles on the USML? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer 
and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
