SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO ONTARIO POWER GENERATION REGARDING A 
USG REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL FOR HELIUM-3 EXTRACTION 
 
REF: A. TORONTO 000173 
     ¶B. STATE 078415 
     ¶C. TORONTO 000163 
     ¶D. STATE 075002 
     ¶E. OTTAWA 000522 
     ¶F. STATE 69767 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request for Consulate General 
Toronto.  Please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BACKGROUND:  Per REF B and in response to REF A and 
C, Washington has agreed to draft a Request for Proposal to 
Ontario Power Generation (OPG) regarding estimated costs 
associated with the transfer of Canadian stores of Helium-3 
to the United States.  Per REF C, the Request for Proposal 
allows OPG to initiate a dialogue to develop a mutually 
acceptable agreement for transfer of Helium-3.  Rather than 
issue a formal Request for Proposal at this time, a Request 
for Information has been generated (see paragraph 4) in order 
to engage OPG in a dialogue and obtain certain information 
for the effort to proceed.  Once some of this information has 
been provided, it will be possible to hold an initial 
face-to-face meeting with "people who can talk business and 
decisions makers" that will lay the groundwork for technical 
discussions between technical experts. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Washington requests that ConGen 
Toronto provide the Request for Information in paragraph 4 to 
appropriate OPG officials for their review by Monday, August 
10, 2009. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION TO OPG REGARDING ESTIMATED 
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSFER OF CANADIAN STORES OF HE-3 
TO THE U.S. 
 
The United States Department of Energy (DOE) provides the 
following elements for consideration and requests information 
and estimated costs pertaining to delivery of He-3 to the DOE 
Savannah River Site: 
 
--A.  OPG would package their solid storage units of helium 
mixture for transport to the Savannah River Site.  This will 
involve packaging that is compliant with Canadian and U.S. 
transportation requirements. 
 
--B.  OPG will allow DOE observers on-site during the 
packaging and loading. 
 
--C.  OPG will advise what, if any, monitoring and reporting 
requirements for the extraction of gases are needed for their 
records or to meet Canadian Government requirements. 
 
--D.  DOE will accept responsibility for the ultimate 
disposition of the storage material, thereby relieving OPG of 
any return transportation and final disposition costs. 
 
--E.  Any suggested thoughts on a formula for the costs of 
extracted materials. 
 
--F.  DOE will provide storage units for future gas loading. 
Would these storage units need to be certified in Canada, or 
is US certification applicable?  On a periodic basis, these 
units would be packaged and shipped to the US as described in 
item 1. 
 
--G.  A schedule and negotiation framework for future 
shipments of solid storage units from future OPG operations 
will be proposed. 
 
--H.  The United States anticipates a current and ongoing 
need of He-3 along with future He-3 OPG production. 
 
--I.  The United States would like to begin receiving He-3 on 
or before October 1, 2010, and would like to have all 
available quantities transferred by October 1, 2011. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) REPORTING DEADLINE:  Washington requests that 
ConGen Toronto respond via front-channel cable no later than 
August 17, 2009. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Washington appreciates Post's assistance.  Contact 
Michael Curry (currymr@state.gov, 202-736-7692) in ISN/WMDT 
for additional information.
