SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND MFAT BRIEFS ON FIJI'S "BLEAK" SITUATION 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) Deputy Secretary Chris Seed invited resident 
chiefs of mission to New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade (MFAT) for an update on developments in Fiji. After 
reviewing recent developments, Seed concluded that "these 
actions demonstrate that Commodore Bainimarama has no 
intention of restoring Fiji to democracy." His five year 
timeframe for elections is simply intended to push any 
restoration of democracy into "the far distant future." No 
longer could Bainimarama's regime be referred to as "an 
interim government;" it was simply "a military supported 
regime." Fiji's suspension from the Pacific Island Forum 
(PIF) and the Commonwealth was now inevitable. Fiji's future, 
he said, is "bleak." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) PIF Secretary General Slade and leaders, including 
New Zealand Foreign Minister McCully, were currently 
consulting among themselves about next steps. One option 
being discussed was suspending Fiji before May 1. Another 
topic was the role of the PIF Ministerial Contact Group after 
Fiji is suspended. New Zealand considered that the group 
continues to have a vital role in monitoring developments in 
Fiji. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) FM McCully has issued two statements condemning the 
abrogation of the Fiji constitution and Bainimarama's 
reappointment (both emailed to EAP/ANP). New Zealand is 
consulting with the PIF, the Commonwealth, and other 
international partners about additional steps to maintain 
pressure on Fiji to move toward democracy, although Seed 
conceded that there appeared to be few additional steps 
available. The GNZ would extend its travel sanctions to 
President Iloilo because of his role in suspending the 
constitution and reappointing Bainimarama. It would, however, 
continue its NZD 5 million assistance program because it 
"supports ordinary people." For the same reason it would 
avoid any trade sanctions. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In response to questions, Seed said that New 
Zealand would not urge travelers to avoid Fiji, simply to 
exercise caution. He said that was no credible evidence that 
the Fiji military was close to splitting. He acknowledged 
that New Zealand is concerned about PIF solidarity and is 
trying to assess how serious the problem might be.
