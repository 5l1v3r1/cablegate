¶1. Transit of Canadian airspace and overnight stop in Goose Bay by 
the NASA aircraft enroute to the UK and return, can proceed 
without GoC diplomatic approval (Ref A). The aircraft will not/not 
be collecting data/conducting research in Canadian airspace, the 
Government of Canada therefore does not require diplomatic 
approval. 
 
¶2. Embassy grants country clearance for NASA personnel (Ref B)
