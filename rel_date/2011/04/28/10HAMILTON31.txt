SUBJECT: BERMUDA: AUDITORS GENERAL CALL ON POLICE TO INVESTIGATE 
MISMANAGEMENT OF GOVERNMENT FUNDS 
 
¶1.      (U)  Reports by both the current and former auditors 
general found evidence of massive mismanagement of government 
funds and recommended that police investigate four cases of 
overspending and/or lack of oversight and poor internal 
controls.  A 2007/08 report by the former auditor general, Larry 
Dennis, presented in the House of Assembly on February 19 
recommended that the police investigate the lack of fiscal 
control over a failed Faith-Based Tourism Initiative conducted 
under the auspices of the Minister of Tourism/Premier Ewart 
Brown to bring religious tourists to the Island.  Brown had 
named Andre Curtis - a political supporter - to head the 
initiative, although Brown denied that bias played a role in his 
selection. 
 
 
 
¶2.      (U) Dennis also noted the complete breakdown of internal 
controls in the expenditure of USD 20.2 million by the former 
National Drug Commission over a five-year period, with evidence 
of fraudulent activity including payment of personal expenses. 
He said that records were "unbalanced, incomplete, unsupported 
and generally inadequate.   Whether this was due to managerial 
incompetence or a purposeful unwillingness to maintain proper 
books of account, or an attempt to conceal improper conduct is 
unclear."   In his report, Dennis called for a police 
investigation, and Finance Minister Paula Cox commented in a 
February 19 press release that her ministry had already 
facilitated a police investigation. 
 
 
 
¶3.      (U) Dennis' 2007/08 report follows earlier 
recommendations by new Auditor General Heather Jacobs Matthews, 
appointed in 2009, that police investigate huge cost overruns on 
two government projects.  On February 1, she announced special 
reports on a new cruise ship terminal that almost doubled in 
cost and a new vehicle emissions testing facility that also far 
exceeded its budget.   Matthews also warned about the overall 
fiscal challenges facing the Island, including a "weakening cash 
position, a substantial bank overdraft, expenditures 
outstripping revenue, increasing long-term debt and a growing 
deficit."  In response to the Matthew's findings, Cox's February 
19 press release stated, "Given concerns with the management and 
oversight of recent and specific capital projects, Government is 
moving already to further strengthen tendering and procurement 
practices, including ensuring that there is the appropriately 
provided expertise to ensure proper scoping and design of 
capital projects to reduce subsequent change orders that are 
often the cause of cost overruns." 
 
 
 
Comment 
 
¶4.      (SBU)  Governor Gozney told the Consul General on 
February 18 that the Police will investigate these allegations, 
although the police might need additional resources assigned to 
its Financial Crimes Unit.  This is not the first time that 
auditors general have criticized the management of the people's 
purse.  The Progressive Labor Party government will, however, be 
unable to continue allegations that the auditor's criticisms are 
racially motivated now that the auditor general's position is 
held by a black female instead of a white male.  The auditor 
general's report does not seem to be politically motivated, 
although the effect might be to ensure that Premier Brown leaves 
office as expected in October.  Premier Brown has withstood 
numerous allegations of improprieties, and we think he will 
weather this round of criticism as well.
