SUBJECT: LOBBYING NEW ZEALAND ON KOSOVO INDEPENDENCE 
 
REF: STATE 13716 
 
Classified By: DCM DAVID J. KEEGAN, EMBASSY WELLINGTON. REASONS 1.4 (B) 
 AND (D). 
 
 ¶1. (C) DCM presented the demarche reftel to Caroline 
Forsyth, MFAT Deputy Secretary for Multilateral and Global 
Affairs, on February 12. She responded that New Zealand has 
been following developments in Kosovo closely. GNZ has a 
long-standing established practice of not making declarations 
of recognition, but it rather allows that to be inferred from 
its actions. She said that she expected the GNZ would do the 
same in this case. 
 
¶2. (C) DCM urged that New Zealand consider some public 
statement in support of Kosovo's declaration of independence, 
perhaps in the form of a press release from the Foreign 
Minister. Forsyth promised to discuss the matter with others 
in the Ministry and get back to post.
