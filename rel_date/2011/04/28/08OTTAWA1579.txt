REF: STATE 132842 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Canada is eager to participate in the Proliferation 
Security Initiative Operational Experts Group and outreach 
meetings in May in Miami, according to Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade non-proliferation senior 
policy advisor David MacDuff.  MacDuff added that Canada is 
particularly interested in the chance to discuss the global 
and regional dimensions of the PSI and WMD-related 
interdictions.  MacDuff was already aware of the May meeting 
in Miami, having attended the September OEG meeting in Paris. 
 MacDuff promised to circulate the reftel non-paper to 
Department of National Defence colleagues, and said that the 
U.S. can "count on strong Canadian participation in this 
event."
