SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO CONVENTION ON 
SUPPLEMENTARY COMPENSATION FOR NUCLEAR DAMAGE 
 
REF: STATE 54213 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  A senior policy analyst from the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT contacted Pol/Econ Counselor 
on June 26 with an interim response to reftel demarche.  She 
noted that her office has sought detailed advice from a New 
Zealand expert, who is also part of the IAEA's expert group 
on nuclear technology (INLEX).  So far, they have not 
received a comprehensive response. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  In general, New Zealand is very supportive of the 
Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) and welcome 
the USG decision to ratify the Convention.  There are many 
aspects of the instrument that New Zealand regards 
positively, including increased compensation limits, new 
heads of damage, etc.  New Zealand, however, has difficulties 
with the CSC's requirement for non-nuclear states which are 
party, and sit above the UN's minimum scale, to contribute in 
the event of any incident.  New Zealand's INLEX expert 
reportedly has raised these concerns before and MFAT believes 
that the USG is aware of the New Zealand government position 
on this issue.  The GNZ is also conscious that the CSC 
ratification process is in an early stage and entry into 
force relies on some of the large nuclear power generating 
nations coming on board. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Post will report further substantive responses from 
the GNZ on this issue.
