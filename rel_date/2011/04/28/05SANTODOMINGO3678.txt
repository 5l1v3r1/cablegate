SUBJECT: DOMINICAN RESPONSE TO REQUEST ON INFO FOR MINISTER 
PARTICIPATION IN WHTI MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 132219 
 
This is in response to reftel request for information on the 
Dominican Republic's participation in the upcoming Western 
Hemisphere Transportation Initiative (WHTI).  The Dominican 
Republic does not have a Minister of Transportation. 
However, Secretary of State for Public Works and 
Communications Manuel de Jesus Perez, known as Freddy Perez, 
will attend the meeting.   Currently there are no pertinent 
transportation issues in the Dominican Republic that would 
merit a bilateral talk between Perez and Secretary Mineta.
