SUBJECT: NOVA SCOTIA AWAITING NEW USG POLICY ON GEORGES BANK 
DRILLING 
 
¶1. High-level officials in the Nova Scotia Department of Energy 
told CG and visiting Canada Desk Director at a November 18 
meeting that they are waiting to see how the new U.S. 
administration defines its policy on oil and gas exploration and 
drilling on Georges Bank as this could affect how the province 
formulates its own policy.  Georges Bank is a lucrative offshore 
area located 100 miles off Cape Cod in the Gulf of Maine and is 
shared by the United States and Canada.  Because of 
anti-drilling sentiment from U.S. and Canadian environmentalists 
and fishing interests, both countries have had drilling 
moratoria on their respective sides since 1988.  Canada's 
current moratorium will expire in 2012 and the debate has 
already started on how the province should deal with the issue. 
At the same time, New England environmentalists and fishing 
industry stakeholders are pressing for a permanent ban on the 
U.S. side. How the new administration responds to those demands 
will be closely watched here. 
 
¶2.  As a minority government, the Government of Nova Scotia's 
(GoNS) current position on the moratorium is understandably 
cautious.  Provincial Energy Minister Richard Hurlburt has 
publicly stated that his government believes the fishing and oil 
and gas industries can co-exist on the Bank, but also asserts 
that there needs to be increased dialogue on the issue.  Like in 
New England, Nova Scotia's fishing industry and 
environmentalists are steadfast in their view that any drilling 
risks irreparable harm to the Bank.  In fact, drilling opponents 
have already formed a lobby group which is readying for a high 
profile campaign should the province signal its intent to let 
the moratorium expire. 
 
¶3.  In our discussion, the GoNS officials asserted that, in the 
20 years since the moratoria were established, the oil and gas 
industry has made notable progress developing environmentally 
responsible offshore drilling practices that minimize impacts on 
the marine environment.  As an example, they pointed to Nova 
Scotia's already operating Sable Island offshore natural gas 
project on the Scotian Shelf, which has operated problem free 
for years. The officials are hopeful that these positive 
experiences will help convince exploration and drilling 
opponents to embrace the Minister's co-existence approach.  Nova 
Scotia's energy sector shares this hope. The industry faces an 
uncertain future since they have identified fewer exploitable 
reserves than anticipated in and around the Scotian Shelf. 
Georges Bank, however, offers much potential.  Scientists 
estimate the area contains one billion barrels of oil and 5.3 
trillion cubic feet of natural gas, but they also see the need 
to do more modern assessments, especially in the deeper water 
around the Bank. 
 
¶4.  COMMENT:  For now the province is anxious to see who gets 
the nod as the new U.S. Energy Secretary and what the 
appointment could mean for both sides of this issue.  However, 
time is not on the province's side.  Under the terms of the 
moratorium legislation, the province must decide by June 2010 
which of three options it wants to exercise:  let the moratorium 
expire, enact another moratorium, or request a public review 
panel to make a recommendation by 2012 on how to proceed.
