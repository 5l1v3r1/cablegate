START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Navdeep Bains Singh is a successful and recognized rookie 
Member of Parliament and a member of the governing Liberal 
Party.  He decisively won his seat in the June 2004 
election, nearly doubling the vote count of the second place 
Conservative candidate.  Bains' seat is in the heart of the 
greater Toronto area, one that is easily perceived as a left- 
leaning Liberal Party stronghold.  In combination with its 
riding density, this leads some observers to cynically, but 
not altogether inaccurately, suggest the country is run from 
Toronto. 
Bains is a new and moderate voice in the party whose 
background in corporate finance does not clearly fit with 
the stereotypical Toronto-area, left leaning Liberal. 
Despite his rookie status he has a seat on the important 
Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and 
Ethics.  This committee investigates topics such as the 
ramifications of the U.S. Patriot Act and Canadians' rights 
to information privacy and the regulation of lobbyists on 
Parliament Hill.  He also featured prominently at the recent 
Liberal Biennial Convention, held in Ottawa between March 3 
and 6.  He was seen at many policy workshops and was a 
favorite of the left-leaning Young Liberals of Canada 
despite his previous existence as a financial analyst and 
certified management accountant. 
Acquainting this open-minded, rookie Liberal MP from Toronto 
first-hand with the policy formulation process in the United 
States will allow him to form his own opinions, rather than 
leave it to older Toronto Liberals to 'teach him.'  An IVLP 
experience could very easily give an MP like Navdeep Bains a 
formative experience that he could call on when expressing 
his own growing voice in Parliament, both in the House of 
Commons, in Committees and within the Liberal Party.   This 
project supports the Mission's goals of countering terrorism 
and strengthening ties with close allies and friends.

START MEMO NOMINATING-JUSTIFICATION: 
Member of Parliament Nathan Cullen is a successful rookie MP 
who was recognized by The Hill Times news magazine as the 
number-one up-and-coming rookie on Parliament Hill at the 
end of the first sitting of the 38th Parliament, in December 
¶2004.  A member of the New Democratic Party of Canada, he 
achieved an unlikely coup by winning (by an admittedly 
narrow margin) his seat by defeating the incumbent 
Conservative Member of Parliament.  It is extremely rare for 
a New Democrat to win a seat in rural, western Canada at 
all, let alone take one from a sitting Conservative. 
The new Democratic Party of Canada is typically left- 
leaning, and a perennial 3rd place party at the national 
level, though the Liberal Party of Canada is frequently 
accused of co-opting their policies to please left-minded 
voters in their own ranks. 
Nathan Cullen is a new and moderate member of the NDP who 
appears to focus more on policy and procedure than following 
a strict, reactionary party line.  He focuses on 
environmental and social issues while acting as his party's 
Critic for National Parks, Environment and Youth.   Giving 
him first-hand observation of policy formulation in the 
United States and a chance to interact and develop contacts 
with Americans involved in issues of mutual concern to North 
American neighbors--security, economic and trade policy, 
environmental issues, and social policies--will help him 
balance realities against the myths that sometimes prevail 
with regard to U.S. positions and intentions.
