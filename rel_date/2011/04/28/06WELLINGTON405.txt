     ¶B. DILI 254 
 
Classified By: DCM DAVID R. BURNETT, 
FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) GNZ officials are deciding what support New Zealand 
will provide to E. Timor now that the Timorese government has 
officially asked for help.  In the morning of May 25, NZ 
Defense Force (NZDF) Assistant Chief for Strategic 
Commitments and Intelligence, Brigadier Warren Whiting, told 
DATT and Pol-Econ Chief that NZ's Defense Attache and 
Ambassador to Dili were joining Australia's high-level 
delegation to discuss command and control, tasks, and terms 
of engagement with GOT.  GNZ officials are meeting regularly 
throughout the day, and Foreign Minister Peters, Defense 
Minister Goff, CDF Mataparae, New Zealand's Deputy High 
Commissioner and Defense Attache in Canberra are all also in 
close contact with their Australian counterparts.  GNZ was 
also anticipating a statement from the UN Security Council 
later today. 
 
¶2.  (C) Whiting, who was joined by Col. Mike Thompson, 
Director of Strategic Commitments, said that the Timorese had 
been far more specific about what they wanted from the 
Australians and the Portuguese than from New Zealand, 
Malaysia, and Singapore.  He said that the UN rep in Timor 
had recommended mostly police intervention, and Portugal was 
sending about 125 gendarmes.  But Australian officials think 
this is more of a military than police operation, and GNZ 
agrees.  Whiting said that in any case, Australia and New 
Zealand do not have para-military forces. 
 
¶3.  (C) Whiting and Thompson said that NZ has two C-130s on 
stand-by that can be moved immediately as needed to help 
transport NZ and/or Australian troops.  They said that GNZ 
assumes the situation has moved from an evacuation of 
noncombatants (NEO) to a military operation.  GNZ has also 
upgraded its travel advisory for E. Timor, although there are 
no Kiwi tourists known to be there, nor does the NZ Embassy 
in Dili have many dependents. There are about 40-49 New 
Zealanders in the country, but as they are more or less 
embedded -- for example doing NGO work -- they are apparently 
in no hurry to leave. 
 
¶4.  (C) As far as GNZ can tell, there appears to be no threat 
to foreigners in E. Timor.  Much of Dili appears to be 
operating as normal and although there have been fire fights 
between groups, they have not been widespread.  There is no 
risk getting to the airport, and commercial flights are still 
available.  GNZ is concerned, however, that foreigners could 
end up being in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
 
¶5.  (C) GNZ has offered to assist Singapore and other 
"approved" foreign nationals in Dili, including allowing them 
to assemble at the NZ Embassy if needed.
