TAGS: PREL AORC KPAO PTER UNSC EU CA
SUBJECT: CANADA AGREES WITH U.S. CALL FOR COMMON APPROACH 
ON UNSCR 1540 
 
REF: STATE 28412 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request -- see para three. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Senior Policy Adviser for Non-proliferation and 
Disarmament Michael Blackmore confirmed on March 20 that 
Canada is in "full agreement" with reftel points.  In 
particular, Canada believes there would be very little 
utility in continuing G8 demarches to non-reporting states. 
Blackmore added that Canada sees merit in the USG's suggested 
approach of asking the G8 to seek the views of the 1540 
Committee on what the G8 could do to help promote UNSCR 1540 
implementation. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Action request:  Blackmore reaffirmed Canada's 
offer to host G8 1540 experts for a substantive discussion on 
the margins of the upcoming meeting of the Non-proliferation 
Directors Group (NPDG) in Tokyo.  He proposed a breakfast 
meeting at the Tokyo Prince Hotel (the NPDG site) on 
Thursday, March 27.  Please provide Embassy with the USG's 
response to this invitation NLT March 24.
