¶1.  (SBU) Member of Parliament for the Yukon Larry Bagnell, in a 
meeting in Ottawa with poloffs on March 13, praised the U.S. Virtual 
Presence Post in the Yukon, and said that he and his constituents 
had found it "extremely useful."  He commented that public awareness 
of the website in the Yukon was "very high," and that many 
constituents had told him they "frequently" used the website to find 
needed information.  Bagnell emphasized that he and his constituents 
were "flattered" that the U.S. had established a virtual post 
dedicated to the Yukon, and expressed his thanks to the U.S. 
Government. 
 
¶2. (U) The United States maintains virtual presence posts in each of 
Canada's three territories: the Yukon, the North West Territories, 
and Nunavut.  These virtual posts are interactive websites that 
serve as fora for information on such topics as U.S. policies, 
U.S.-Canada bilateral relations, traveling to the U.S., and USG 
services.  Each virtual presence post is linked to an actual U.S. 
consulate.  The Yukon Virtual Presence Post is linked to the U.S. 
Consulate in Vancouver, and includes a bio of the Consul General and 
information on contacting the Consulate.  Please see

in Canada.
