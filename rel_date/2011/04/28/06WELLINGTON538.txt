¶1. (SBU) Since March 2006, a number of replacement and new equipment 
items have been ordered by RSO Wellington 
for projects at post.  The replacement equipment (two 24-zone AES 
monitors) was requested both through the OTIS system and by email. 
The new equipment items were requested in Ref. A, B, C, and through 
the OTIS system as well as by email.  To date, none of this 
equipment has arrived at post. 
 
¶2. (SBU) RSO Wellington's impression of the OTIS ordering system is 
that the system does not work.  Although we have received a 
confirmation of the order each time we have ordered this way, the 
material never appears and there has been no follow-up to tell Post 
about equipment shortages in the pipeline, contractual difficulties, 
etc.  We wonder if other posts are experiencing similar difficulties 
with OTIS. 
 
¶3. (SBU) We've had better feedback rates on our cable requests, but 
similar problems with delivery of items. We were informed that the 
CCTV contract was changing and that the equipment we ordered was 
going to be replaced with other equipment.  However, three months 
after sending in the original ESSR, no equipment for the CCTV 
installations has yet arrived.  A similar time frame has lapsed 
since the Aiphone video intercoms were ordered. 
 
¶4. (SBU) As a follow-up, please provide the following security 
equipment to Wellington as soon as possible: 
 
1 MY-2CD intercom mast stat, for the MSG booth ICM 267 
2 MK-DGV surface mount sing gang vid door stat ICM 275 
2 MK-DVC vandal resistant mounting box         ICM 276

1 PS 18E Aiphone power supply 110/220 VAC      ICM 241 
2 AES 24-zone alarm monitors, rack mount       ALM 102
