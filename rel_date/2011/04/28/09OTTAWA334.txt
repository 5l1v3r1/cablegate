SUBJECT: CANADA SUPPORTS U.S./AUSTRALIA ON SHIP RECYCLING 
CONVENTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 41904 
 
¶1. (sbu) Econcouns and Emil Stojanovski, Third Secretary at 
the Australian High Commission, delivered reftel joint 
demarche on the draft international convention for the safe 
and environmentally sound recycling of ships to Transport 
Canada's Manager for Environmental Protection Paul Topping on 
May 4.  Topping, who will lead Canadian delegation to the 
International Maritime Organization's diplomatic conference 
in Hong Kong on May 11-15, said Canada would support the 
U.S./Australia proposed amendments to the draft convention. 
Topping, however, expressed doubt that India and the European 
Union would agree to the U.S./Australian position.  He stated 
that if the U.S./Australia proposal is blocked in Hong Kong, 
Canada would be ready to broker a compromise by 
re-introducing its own proposal regarding convention 
"non-parties" from the March 2008 Marine Environment 
Protection Committee (MEPC).  Topping provided the text of 
the Canadian proposal, which follows below.
