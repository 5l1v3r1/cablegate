SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND'S PRIORITIES FOR APEC 2006 
 
REF: STATE 14967 
 
(U) Classified by: Political-Economic Counselor Katherine B. 
Hadda.  Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Rupert Holborow, New Zealand's senior official for 
APEC, said his government has identified key issues it would 
like APEC 2006 to address, but "without specificity" since it 
is waiting to learn about other APEC economies' priorities. 
Meanwhile, New Zealand sees APEC Senior Official Chairman Le 
Cong Phung as very capable, but is concerned that APEC 2006 
may be "quieter" than in past years because an inexperienced 
Vietnam is the host.  Holborow wondered whether Vietnam would 
have the confidence to drive the agenda and be "a bully at 
the end of the day," as often has been necessary to obtain 
economies' agreement.  However, Holborow stressed he was not 
yet judging Vietnam's ability to host APEC.  "It gives pause 
for thought," he said. 
 
¶2. (U) In a meeting February 7, Holborow told Econoff that 
New Zealand's priorities for the APEC 2006 agenda would be: 
 
¶A. WTO and the Doha Development Agenda.  While New Zealand 
does not yet know what APEC might be able to do to move the 
Doha Round forward, New Zealand believes APEC can make a 
difference.  Pushing for progress in the WTO remains New 
Zealand's top priority for APEC. 
 
¶B. Commitment to develop model chapters and guidelines for 
free trade agreements and regional trade agreements by 2008. 
While some economies favor completing a chapter at a time, 
New Zealand would prefer that all chapters be tackled 
simultaneously and that a timeline be set for finishing them. 
 Otherwise, New Zealand fears that the "easier" chapters 
would be dealt with first, and progress would stall over the 
tougher chapters. 
 
¶C. Commitment to reducing trade facilitation -- or business 
transaction -- costs by 5 percent this year.  New Zealand 
also would like an additional commitment to a 5 percent 
reduction in 2007. 
 
¶D. Enabling private sector development and improving the ease 
of doing business, including such issues as trade 
liberalization, trade facilitation and the regulatory 
environment.  New Zealand and Canada have proposed a 
symposium, "Enabling Private Sector Development," for May 
9-10 in Montreal, to coincide with APEC Business Advisory 
Council meetings.  Senior officials will be invited, and New 
Zealand particularly hopes that U.S. Senior Official Michalak 
or Assistant USTR Cutler will be able to attend. 
 
¶E. Work on an agreement on investment. 
 
¶F. Structural reform.  New Zealand and Japan are sponsoring a 
work plan through 2010.  At the Third Senior Officials 
Meeting, New Zealand will sponsor a seminar on public sector 
governance. 
 
¶G. Avian influenza and health issues.  Mark Jacobs, director 
of public health, will represent New Zealand on the health 
task force. 
 
¶H. Counter-terrorism. New Zealand supports Singapore's supply 
chain management proposal.  New Zealand will contribute NZ 
$200,000 (US $136,160) to the Asia Development Bank for a 
project to harmonize aviation and security regulations in the 
Pacific.  In addition, Holborow said New Zealand should soon 
sign the memorandum of understanding to participate in the 
Regional Movement Alert List System and be added to the 
communique by March 1. 
 
¶3. (C) Holborow remarked that the U.S. achieved success in 
promoting its counter-terrorism initiatives in APEC last year 
by rolling the initiatives out early, keeping their number to 
a minimum and then "quietly thumping away" at gaining support 
for them. 
 
¶4. (U) Holborow noted that Michalak, during his confirmation 
hearing January 31 before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, identified as a U.S. objective for APEC the 
protection of the food supply against deliberate 
contamination.  Given the New Zealand economy's dependence on 
agriculture, Holborow is particularly keen to learn what the 
U.S. has in mind in this area. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Holborow will arrive in Hanoi for the Senior 
Officials Meeting on February 25.  His office has asked 
EAP/EP for a meeting with Michalak.  Meanwhile, the New 
Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on February 7 
 
WELLINGTON 00000102  002 OF 002 
 
 
instructed its posts to seek information on APEC economies' 
objectives for 2006.
