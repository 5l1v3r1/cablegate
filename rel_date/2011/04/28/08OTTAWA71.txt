SUBJECT: CANADIAN COURT STRIKES DOWN IPOD LEVY 
 
¶1. (U) Federal Court of Appeals of Canada ruled on January 11 
that the Copyright Board of Canada does not have the 
authority to place a copyright levy on iPods and other 
digital music players.  It is possible that the board will 
appeal this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The 
Copyright Board had planned to charge a levy of up to $75CAD 
on digital music players sold in Canada.  This levy, similar 
to ones on blank CDs, would "compensate" Canadian musicians 
(and only Canadian musicians) for music sales allegedly lost 
to piracy. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Most retailers and consumers are pleased by the 
decision, and it may inspire renewed calls for the Government 
to make format shifting (e.g., moving music from a legally 
owned CD to an iPod) clearly legal.  Format shifting is 
currently a legal gray area in Canada.  Although the Canadian 
music industry is concerned about piracy, many industry 
insiders, including the Canadian Recording Industry 
Association (CRIA), believe that a levy on digital music 
players is a poor solution.  Because a levy forces consumers 
to pay compensation for downloaded music, a legal argument 
might be made that the levy legalizes unlimited file sharing. 
 This legal theory has yet to be tested in a Canadian court.
