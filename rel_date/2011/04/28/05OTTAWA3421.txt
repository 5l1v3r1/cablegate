     ¶B. OTTAWA 3198 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Steve Blais, who officially becomes Director of the 
Pakistan and South Asia office at the Canadian International 
Development Agency next Monday, said the GOC plans to 
announce that it will make a major commitment to earthquake 
relief after it has had time to digest the World Bank/Asia 
Development Bank reconstruction report.  However, given the 
underfunding problem reported by the UN, Canada is 
considering a preliminary announcement of C$25 million (over 
US$21 million) in new money on November 19, in addition to 
announcing the major new commitment in response to the 
reconstruction report.  (This would be on top of the C$57 
Canadian commitment described in Ref B.)  The decision on 
Canada's pledge in Islamabad will not be finalized until late 
this afternoon.  Hau Sing Tse, CIDA's Vice President for 
Asia, is leading Canada's delegation in Islamabad. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Note:  Blais confirmed that a call for a 
parliamentary election, likely within the next few weeks, 
could complicate the major new funding pledge, which would 
require Cabinet approval. However, the GOC is committed to 
supporting earthquake relief and we are certain that funding 
will be confirmed as quickly as possible.  If Canada 
announces C$25 million in emergency relief in Islamabad, that 
funding should not be affected by domestic politics.  End 
note.
