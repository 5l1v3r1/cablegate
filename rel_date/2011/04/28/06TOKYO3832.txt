¶1.  (SBU) Ambassador Schieffer and Russian Ambassador 
Losyukov on July 7, 2006 delivered reftel demarche to Deputy 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Yabunaka.  Yabunaka thanked the 
Ambassadors for informing the GOJ prior to the official 
announcement of the Initiative at the G8 summit.  Noting that 
Japan considers nuclear terrorism to be a matter of great 
concern, Yabunaka said that, after briefing FM Aso and PM 
Koizumi, he expects Japan to support the Initiative and make 
public statements reflecting that position after the 
Initiative has been made public. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ESToff contacted MOFA International Nuclear Energy 
Cooperation Division Deputy Director Kawaguchi on July 10, 
2006 for a more substantive read-out of Japan's position on 
the Initiative and learned that the GOJ: 
 
-- supports the Initiative and will prepare a public 
statement to be released after the Initiative has been 
announced by Presidents Bush and Putin; 
 
-- is holding internal discussions to determine which 
Agencies and Ministries will be responsible for implementing 
the Initiative; 
 
-- will support the Russia-proposed G8 Summit expression of 
support by all G8 leaders to commit to pursuing the necessary 
steps to combat nuclear terrorism; and 
 
-- is willing to meet again at a later date to hold further 
discussions on the Initiative.
