     ¶B. TORONTO 108 
 
¶1. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
outstanding performance of economic officer Robert Merrigan, 
consular officer Molly Pledge, and political/economic officer 
Sherri Holliday-Sklar for their timely and thorough 
investigation of Blue Lantern cases.  As you know, the Blue 
Lantern program is the Department's primary instrument for 
monitoring the end-use of exported defense articles, 
technology, and services.  This program is indispensable to 
PM's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls in making informed 
licensing decisions, discovering illicit supply networks, and 
deterring diversions of U.S. military articles and technology. 
 
¶2. For a second year in a row (ref A), the Mission to Canada 
has distinguished itself as a model of collaboration among 
personnel spread across a very large country.  This year, 
ConGen Toronto deserves special recognition.  Mss. Pledge and 
Holliday-Sklar expertly conducted and reported on at least 
three end-use checks, including one that was quite complex 
and time-consuming (ref B).  Mr. Merrigan extended his track 
record of diligence, thoroughness, and professionalism in 
efficiently either conducting or coordinating at least ten 
high-quality checks. 
 
¶3. The PM Bureau and the Department are grateful for the 
efforts of Mr. Merrigan and Mss. Pledge and Holliday-Sklar, 
which have demonstrably contributed to the security and 
integrity of U.S. defense trade.
