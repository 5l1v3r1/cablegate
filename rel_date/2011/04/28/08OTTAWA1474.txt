SUBJECT: CANADA SEEKS GREATER COHERENCE IN GLOBAL 
INITIATIVE TO COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM 
 
REF: STATE 123059 
 
¶1.  (SBU) After receiving reftel demarche points and 
non-paper, Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) Senior Policy Advisor for Non-proliferation 
David MacDuff said on November 20 that Canada believes the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) is 
struggling to find direction and coherence.  MacDuff 
commented that he hoped the GICNT partners can find consensus 
in the coming months on a comprehensive strategy that is 
"coherent and progressive."  He said the group's work agenda 
needs to be coherent in the sense that it should follow a 
well thought out strategy, rather than a "scattershot 
approach" based on which expert can be rounded up to attend a 
particular meeting, or seeking to satisfy competing 
inter-agency interests by including any and all themes. 
MacDuff added that the work agenda should also be 
"progressive" in the sense that each experts' meeting should 
build on the previous one and each meeting should have some 
thematic relationship to the previous one. 
 
¶2. (SBU) MacDuff promised to coordinate with Public Safety 
Canada to generate specific comments on the model guidelines 
document and provide them directly to the POCs.
