Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) GNZ officials welcome USG participation in and support for 
January events hosted by PM Clark to commemorate the International 
Polar year and the 50th anniversary of US-NZ cooperation in 
Antarctica.  New Zealand may also host events in-country for 
official USG visitors, including those unable to travel to the ice. 
GNZ is eager to ensure it supports US logistical planning for 
Antarctica, and plans to send a team to Washington October 11-12 to 
discuss requirements for the next 10-15 years.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On September 14, David Keegan, DCM Embassy Wellington, and 
EAP/ANP Econoff Alisa Wong, met with  Trevor Hughes, Head of the 
Antarctic Policy Unit at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
(MFAT) and other NZ officials to discuss plans to commemorate the 
50th anniversary of NZ-US cooperation in Antarctica.  (A complete 
list of NZ participants is at para 8.  EAP/ANP Director Steven 
McGann was originally supposed to lead the U.S. side but 
unexpectedly had to leave Wellington before the meeting.)

50th Anniversary Commemorations 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hughes confirmed that PM Clark would visit Scott Base, 
McMurdo Sound from January 19-23, arriving on a USAF C-17 and 
leaving via a RNZAF C-130.  Sir Edmund Hillary (who will travel to 
Antarctica on January 17) will join the PM at Scott on January 20 to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the base as well as 50 years of 
US-NZ cooperation on the ice.  Hughes said GNZ is delighted that 
Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky, OES 
Assistant Secretary Claudia McMurray, and National Science 
Foundation Director Dr. Arden Bement may also participate in the 
commemorations.  GNZ plans for the event to center around raising 
the flag at Scott, as the top of the flag pole was originally 
Captain Scott's.  PM Clark will deliver a speech, and the lead U.S. 
representative will be invited to do the same. 
The event will be followed by a luncheon open to all US and NZ 
attendees.  PM Clark will then open a new facility at Scott, and 
there will be a formal dinner with McMurdo Base that night. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The PM has four goals for the commemorations, said 
Hughes: 
 
-- To celebrate 50 years of U.S.-NZ cooperation on the ice its 
contributions to bilateral relations; 
 
-- To recognize the 50th anniversary of Sir Edmund's opening of 
Scott Base; 
 
-- To emphasize the role of New Zealand and the United States in 
preserving the historic Antarctic huts; and 
 
-- To launch New Zealand's International Polar Year (IPY) programs, 
including by acknowledging New Zealand's 25% share in the Anhill ice 
drilling project, results of which will be reported during the IPY. 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Hughes said other plans include having Sir Edmund travel 
down to the ice via a USAF C-17 on September 17, before PM Clark 
arrives.  The PM will take a helicopter tour of Antarctica on 
September 19.   MFAT America's Desk Deputy Gabrielle Rush said her 
division is putting together a book of reminiscences by notable 
Americans and New Zealanders who have worked in different capacities 
in Antarctica, including scientists and those who dealt with the Air 
NZ plane crash on Mt. Erebus and mid-winter rescues.   Regarding 
plans within New Zealand,  Antarctic NZ Chief Lou Sanson said there 
will be a function aboard the HMSNZ Endeavor in Christchurch to 
acknowledge US-NZ cooperation on the ice, as well as exhibits in 
various armed forces museums. 
 
----------------------- 
VISITORS TO NEW ZEALAND 
----------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Hughes said the PM may also host New Zealand-based events 
for visiting dignitaries, especially as GNZ is conscious that some 
 
WELLINGTON 00000736  002 OF 002 
 
 
visitors will be unable to go down to the ice.  GNZ has already 
approved Guest of Government status for NSF Director Bement, which 
typically means GNZ will expedite his immigration processing, handle 
his intra-New Zealand transport, and host a Ministerial event in his 
honor.  GNZ may also offer other USG delegates Guest of Government 
visits, which because of the difficulties of getting people on and 
off the ice NZ officials prefer would precede the Scott Base 
commemorations. 
 
------------------------------ 
LOGISTICS PLANNING FOR THE ICE 
------------------------------ 
 
¶7.  (SBU) The Kiwi side told the DCM and Wong that  officials from 
MFAT, Antarctic New Zealand, NZ Defence Forces, and Treasury have 
for the past year been working on an exercise to identify the 
country's future logistic needs in Antarctica and to identify ways 
New Zealand can contribute to U.S. logistical efforts.  Hughes 
acknowledged that there were air lift "hiccups" on the NZ side due 
to NZDF's C-130 upgrades.  Sanson said he has been discussing the 
problem with NSF Director for Polar Programs Karl Erb.  New Zealand 
government ministers have now approved Sanson take a team of NZ 
defense and foreign affairs officials to Washington October 11-12 to 
discuss icebreakers and other logistics needs over the next 5-10 
years.  Said Sanson, "We want to ensure that we help you the best we 
can."   Hughes said once the NZ team returned to Wellington a paper 
would be submitted to Cabinet asking they approve funding for NZ's 
logistical commitments.
