SUBJECT: CANADA'S POSITIVE RESPONSE TO U.S. DESIGNATION OF 
IRAN'S DEFENSE INDUSTRIES ORGANIZATION UNDER E.O. 13382 
 
REF: SECSTATE 40909 
 
¶1. (SBU) On Aril 5, 2007 Econoff delivered points in reftel 
to Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs officials from the 
legal office, non-proliferation office, and Iran desk.  The 
Canadian officials expressed their support for U.S. and UN 
policies of freezing financial assets of entities and 
individuals involved in proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction.  Marc-Antoine Dumas, Legal Officer in the UN, 
Human Rights, and Economic Law division explained that 
Canadian law requires UN Security Council designations be 
immediately incorporated into Canadian law.  Therefore, 
Iran's Defense Industries Organization (DIO) is already 
designated under Canadian Law. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Chrystiane Roy, Department of Foreign Affairs Iran 
Desk Officer, noted that U.S. Executive Order 13382 lists 
several aliases for DIO that were not included in UNSCR 1737. 
 Roy explained that because Canadian Law requires Canadian 
designations to follow UNSCR information, the aliases not 
included in the security council resolution have not been 
incorporated into Canadian law.  Therefore, she encouraged 
the United States Government to work to include as many 
aliases as possible for designated entities, including these 
aliases, in Security Council resolution designations.

Michael Blackmore - Senior Policy Officer, Non-proliferation 
and Disarmament Division 
Craig Weichel - Nuclear Non-proliferation Officer,

Rights, and Economic Law Division
