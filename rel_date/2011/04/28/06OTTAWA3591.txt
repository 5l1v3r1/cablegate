SUBJECT: CANADA ANNOUNCES NEW FUNDING FOR OVERSEAS HIV/AIDS 
EFFORT 
 
 
¶1. Canada's International Cooperation Minister Josee Verner 
announced on December 1, World AIDS Day, C$120 million to 
fight HIV/AIDS overseas.  This is over and above what Canada 
has previously pledged to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis, and Malaria.  The new funding will support 
global efforts focused on prevention, strengthening health 
systems, promoting gender equality and women's empowerment, 
and promoting children's rights, specifically of those 
infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.  Canadian programming on 
HIV/AIDS will continue to rely on working through 
partnerships and concentrates on South Africa, Tanzania, 
Mozambique, Zambia, Ukraine, Haiti, and the Balkans. 
 
¶2. Of the total, C$41 million will go to support research in 
prevention (C$20 million for vaccine research, C$15 million 
for development of microbicides, and C$6 million to support 
collaborative Canadian-African research on HIV/AIDS 
prevention).   C$20 million over two years will go to 
Tanzania to support the government's HIV/AIDS plans, C$10 
million over five years will go to Mozambique for the same 
purposes, and C$4.4 million (over five years) will go to 
South Africa.  Funding will go also to a variety of Canadian 
and international NGOs working in Haiti (C$19 million over 
five years), the Balkans (C$7 million over four years to NGOs 
for work among adolescents), Africa and Vietnam (C$4.9 
million for "sustainable livelihood options"), Ukraine, 
Russia and Georgia (C$3 million over three years targeted at 
programs for injected drug users), Zimbabwe (C$2.5 million 
for three years focused on preventing mother-to-child 
transmission), and smaller amounts for NGO programming in 
Malawi, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Ghana, and 
Cameroon. 
 
¶3. The geographic and organizational (as well as 
programmatic) distribution of the funding Minister Verner 
announced on World AIDS Day highlights several hallmarks of 
Canada's support for HIV/AIDS programming.  The vast majority 
of Canadian funding is targeted at programs in Africa, and 
the Canadian preference is to work through partners.  As 
indicated above, governments are partners on some programs, 
and NGOs are partners on others.  At least 16 NGOs and 
several quasi-governmental agencies will receive portions of 
the C$120 million announced by Verner. 
 
¶4. This C$120 million is separate from Canada's support for 
global programming against infectious diseases channeled 
through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria.  Even so, Canada is presently the seventh largest 
contributor to the Global Fund according to Fund data (in 
terms of pledges to the paid up as of December 2006) with 
total contributions of USD 431 million since 2001. 
 
¶5. Observers expect that Minister of Health Tony Clement will 
announce new funding for domestic HIV/AIDS programming within 
the next couple of months.
