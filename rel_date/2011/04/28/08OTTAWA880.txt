¶1. (SBU) Deputy Minister of Canada's Afghanistan Task Force 
in the Privy Council Office David Mulroney on June 25 briefed 
Canada's key partners on Canada's new priorities in 
Afghanistan.  Mulroney told the chiefs of mission or 
representatives of Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Australia, 
New Zealand, Denmark, The Netherlands, France, Pakistan, 
Afghanistan, India, and the U.S. that, even though Foreign 
Minister Emerson had already announced the priorities 
publicly on June 10 (reftel), he wanted to discuss Canada's 
direction in Afghanistan with them personally, and receive 
any feedback they might have. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mulroney emphasized that Canada's new priorities 
included focusing its efforts on Kandahar Province, and 
favoring certain "signature projects" that would have a 
visible impact and help Canada receive recognition for its 
contributions. Mulroney also stated that the Canadian 
government was attempting to strike a better balance between 
the civilian and military sides of its mission in 
Afghanistan.  He noted that Canada was expanding its civilian 
"footprint" by increasing the number of civilians members of 
its PRT in Kandahar, and by establishing the civilian 
position of Representative of Canada in Kandahar (RoCK), 
equivalent in rank to the Lieutenant Colonel serving in 
Kandahar and reporting to the Canadian Ambassador in Kabul. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mulroney noted that this is an active fighting 
season and a "rough time" for the Canadian mission in 
Afghanistan, especially with the recent Taliban prison attack 
in Kandahar City.  He acknowledged that Canada saw the attack 
as a "set-back," but said the quick work of Canadian and 
Afghan forces had diminished the "information operations 
advantage" the Taliban had originally gained.  He noted that 
the Canadians and Afghans had completed the first phase of 
prison reconstruction. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Afghan Ambassador to Canada remarked that, while 
he agreed this was a "tough time," he also saw "hope and 
promise" in Afghanistan, especially following the 
international show of support at the recent Paris donors 
conference.  The Danish Ambassador to Canada emphasized the 
importance of focusing on the civilian aspects of the 
mission, and the Dutch Ambassador underlined that ISAF 
countries should ensure they are effectively communicating 
with each other.  Mulroney added that Canada would like to 
see the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and UN 
Special Representative in Afghanistan Kai Eide play more 
active roles.
