¶1. Fees paid by telecommunications carriers in Canada 
are based on the cost of the regulators' 
telecommunications-related activities, multiplied by 
the carrier's share of industry operating revenue (see 
Telecommunications Fees Regulations, SOR/95-157). 
Telecoms firms have not complained to us about such 
costs.  Nor are we aware of any capitalization or 
bonding requirement. 
 
¶2. The main market access barrier is the restriction 
on foreign ownership.  Because non-Canadians may own 
no more than 46.7 percent of a "facilities-based" 
telecommunication carrier, U.S. and other foreign 
telecom players can only enter the Canadian market in 
partnership with Canadian firms.
