¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  On April 15 Canadian government prosecutors 
stayed terrorism-related charges against four more suspects in the 
2006 "Toronto 18" terror plots.  The move reduces the number of 
suspects facing charges to 11 (charges against three minors were 
stayed earlier).  Consulate law enforcement contacts suggest that 
the decision may be an attempt to focus charges only on those 
individuals who appear to be most directly involved in the summer 
2006 plots, and away from more tangential figures.  Crown 
prosecutors have been cautious throughout, perhaps reflecting a 
desire that the first prosecutions under strengthened Canadian 
anti-terror laws produce no surprises or embarrassment.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On April 15, Canadian federal ("Crown") prosecutors stayed 
charges against three of the accused, Abdul Qayyum Jamal, Ibrahim 
Aboud, and Ahmad Ghany.  The three Toronto area residents signed a 
peace bond with strict bail conditions on their activities and 
travel, which if abided by, will lead to the final dismissal of all 
charges in 12 months.  A fourth accused member of the group (Abdi 
Mohammed, who was in jail on weapons charges at the time of the 
initial wave of arrests in 2006) also had his charges stayed, but 
was not required to sign a bond.  The decision to stay charges 
against Jamal was surprising, as he had been previously described as 
a ringleader and terrorist recruiter, and had spent 13 months in 
solitary confinement.  Crown prosecutors offered no explanation for 
the move, indicating simply that their decision to proceed in this 
manner best served the public interest. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT:  Despite media crowing that the decision is highly 
damaging to the Crown, the decision to effectively drop charges 
against four individuals does not necessarily call into question the 
integrity of the remaining proceedings.  When they feel the evidence 
warrants it, prosecutors have not been reluctant to take the cases 
to trial, as in the ongoing trial of one of the accused (Ref (A)) 
and in the decision in the fall of 2007 to terminate preliminary 
proceedings and move directly to trial on all remaining cases (Ref 
(B)).  The Crown appears to be drawing a distinction between 
individuals who attended what prosecutors describe as a "terrorist 
training camp" in rural Ontario in the winter of 2005 and those who 
were allegedly more directly involved in the plot to purchase 
explosive material and attack Canadian landmarks in Ottawa and 
Toronto.  END COMMENT.
