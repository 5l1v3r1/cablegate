¶1. Per reftel A request, post's Principal Officer contacted 
Port of Montreal (POM) Security Director Felixpier Bergeron 
to inquire about the POM's progress in completing a plan of 
action to comply with the new international regulations and 
standards set by the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO) International Shipping and Port Security Code (ISPS). 
 
¶2. Security Director Bergeron, drafter of the POM plan, 
reported that the Montreal plan is completed.  He added that 
Transport Canada representatives visited the POM on 
yesterday (May 11), reviewed the plan and were pleased with 
it.  He stated that translation of the plan from English to 
French, which is expected to be completed in two weeks, is 
the only detail holding up Transport Canada's final 
approval. 
 
¶3. Bergeron pointed out that the POM plan may differ from 
most other ports' plans because it is a Master Plan that 
consists of 29 sub-plans, one sub-plan for each facility or 
activity that interfaces with the port.  For example, he 
said there is a separate plan for the pilot boats' 
terminal, the petroleum terminal, etc.  The estimated price 
tag to implement the POM plan is approximately $9 million 
(Canadian). 
 
¶4. In response to PO's question about possible technical 
assistance needs, Bergeron emphasized that the POM has had 
in place for almost two years enhanced access controls and a 
top-flight camera surveillance program that is monitored in 
the Harbor Master's Control Center.  (Note: PO learned on an 
April 26 POM visit arranged for WHA DAS Jewell, that 
redundant images from the camera surveillance program are 
routed to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police office located at 
the port.  End note.)  Bergeron also mentioned that other 
international port authorities (ie., Marseille, France and 
Dakar, Senegal) have visited and/or have arranged imminent 
visits to the POM, to study the POM plan and/or consult on 
the preparation of their ports' respective plans.
