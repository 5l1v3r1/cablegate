SUBJECT: Request for DVC with Editor and Publisher of the Cook 
Report, Charlie Cook, Who Analyzes US Elections and National 
Political Trends 
 
 
¶1. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Post requests a DVC with Charlie Cook, which 
will look at the outcome of the 2006 midterm elections and how they 
affect the Presidency, US foreign policy, and US policy in New 
Zealand in particular. 
 
¶2. Preferred Activity Date, Fiscal Year, and Quarter:  This is an 
FY07 program, requested for a few days after the midterm elections 
-- ideally the week starting November 13 US time; first quarter; 
6:00 pm EST - noon NZ time of the following day. 
 
¶3. JUSTIFICATION OF PROGRAM: The national climate for the 2006 
midterm elections portends big changes, yet race-by-race analyses 
reveal formidable odds against a Democratic takeover of either the 
House or the Senate.  Voters' unhappiness over the direction of the 
country, Congress's low approval ratings, President Bush's 
job-approval scores, and Democrats' advantage on the generic 
congressional ballot test all suggest that Democrats should be able 
to seize the House and possibly the Senate. 
Post regards such a DVC as an occasion for its contacts to discuss 
election issues directly with Charlie Cook -- widely regarded as one 
of the nation's leading authorities on US elections and political 
trends -- as an exciting opportunity.  The New York Times has called 
Cook, "one of the best political handicappers in the nation" and 
notes that The Cook Political Report is "a newsletter that both 
parties regard as authoritative."  David Broder of The Washington 
Post considers Charlie Cook as "perhaps the best non-partisan 
tracker of Congressional races." 
 
¶4. MPP THEME AND EXPECTED AUDIENCE: MPP GOAL 08-01, Mutual 
Understanding - Elections. 
Audience Expected:  To include members of the New Zealand 
government, including members of Parliament; local politicians, 
lobbyists, political consultants, government officials, members of 
foreign embassies, academics, opinion-makers, policy-makers, members 
of the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs (NZIIA), and 
the media.
