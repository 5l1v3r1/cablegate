SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CANADIAN 
GOVERNMENT ON THE POTENTIAL EXTRACTION OF HELIUM-3 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request for Embassy Ottawa.  Please 
see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BACKGROUND: Since September 11, 2001, United States 
Government commercial use of helium-3 has grown faster than 
available supply.  As a result, the United States faces a 
shortage of helium-3 (He-3). He-3 is a primary material 
requirement for radiation detection equipment.  An 
interagency group has been formed to assess the immediate, 
mid-term, and long-term implications of this shortage. 
 
The Department of Energy's (DOE) Second Line of Defense 
Program only has a sufficient supply for about 20% of the 
radiation detection equipment that is responsible for the 
Global Nuclear Detection Architecture. Additional DOE 
programs, as well as programs at the Department of Homeland 
Security, Department of Defense, and other agencies are also 
impacted by this current, and projected to be long-term 
shortage. Canada has a supply of He-3, which is produced 
during the decay of tritium. A potentially significant 
capital investment would be required to convert it from its 
current storage medium. 
 
United States' manufacturers, technical experts from the DOE 
Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), and a Department 
of Energy Office of Isotope Sales manager have had informal 
discussions with Canadian counter-parts. Canada has not been 
particularly interested in pursuing the interests of the 
commercial firms, but did indicate a willingness to consider 
responding to an expression of Government interest, 
especially if the extracted He-3 would be used to protect 
their Nation's and international interests.  DOE would like 
to bring a team to meet with their Canadian counterparts and 
appropriate host Government officials to determine whether a 
reliable supply of He-3 can be provided and, on behalf of the 
interagency group, to generally describe the shortage, the 
benefits from accessing the Canadian supply, and to provide 
information relative to the appropriate national security 
uses of the extracted He-3. The association of He-3 with 
Tritium may raise concerns regarding the host nation's 
nonproliferation policy and also the applicability of any 
export control policy concerns that may be brought up. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Post is requested to arrange a 
meeting with the appropriate GOC officials to discuss the 
items in paragraph 4 with senior USG officials, preferably 
between August 1-11 or 24-31, 2009. Additionally, Washington 
would appreciate an opportunity to have a pre-meeting with 
the appropriate Embassy staff, should that be desired, and is 
assuming that one or more of the Embassy staff would 
participate in the proposed meeting with GOC officials in 
August. 
 
¶4. (SBU) PROPOSED AGENDA: 
 
-- Introduction & Purpose of the visit 
-- He-3 Background 
-- Predicted He-3 demand and supply 
-- Impact on Radiation Detection 
-- Investigate vehicles that would allow for the harvesting 
of Ontario Power's He-3 
-- Open Discussion 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) REPORTING DEADLINE:  Washington requests that Post 
respond via front-channel cable no later than July 13, 2009. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Washington appreciates Post's assistance.  Contact 
Michael Curry (currymr@state.gov), 202-736-7692 in ISN/WMDT 
for additional information.
