¶1. Officials from Environment Canada and the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade confirmed to ESTH 
Counselor on July 6 that letters signed by Environment 
Minister John Baird and Foreign Minister Peter MacKay 
officially requesting Canada's admission to the Asia Pacific 
Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (APP) had all 
been delivered, except for that to Korea, which was set to be 
delivered on July 9.  Per reftel, officials had told Embassy 
they hoped to have the letters delivered by the end of June. 
However, since they were to be delivered at high levels 
(i.e., by ambassadors and high commissioners to ministers) 
scheduling complications delayed delivery past the end of the 
month.  Foreign Miniser MacKay gave the letter addressed to 
the U.S. to Secretary Rice on July 6. 
 
¶2. Canadian officials continue to believe their request for 
membership will receive support from all current partners and 
hope that the Policy and Implementation Committee will 
endorse Canada's request at its meeting in Tokyo later this 
month.  This would set the stage for Canada's admission to 
the Partnership at the upcoming ministerial meeting in New 
Delhi.
