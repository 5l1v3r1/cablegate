¶1.  The GONL has organized a full agenda for the 2007 Global 
Road Safety Week (April 23-27), primarily focusing on public 
awareness and road safety among young people between the ages 
of 4 and 24.  On April 23, the Dutch will hold a news 
conference during which they will present the 2006 road 
safety statistics.  On each day of Global Road Safety Week, 
the Dutch will focus on a different age group (from ages 4 to 
24).  Such efforts will include announcements of several new 
local projects and public outreach for existing projects 
targeting road safety for young drivers.  The Dutch will 
release several publications during the week, including a 
book on truck blind spots and an OECD publication on young 
drivers. 
 
¶2.  In February, the Dutch conducted a national survey among 
9 - 12 year olds related to problems encountered by Dutch 
youth on the road.  Children who present the most creative 
solutions in each age group will be awarded prizes, including 
a Euro Disneyland weekend.  The announcement of winners and 
results of this national primary school survey will be 
released during Global Road Safety Week.  A Jubilee Congress 
will also be held during the week marking the 45th 
anniversary of the Road Safety Research Institute.  On the 
final day of the congress, there will be a debate in the 
World Youth Assembly between national/regional politicians, 
safety experts, and young road users. 
 
¶3.  All these events are being organized by and coordinated 
with the Dutch Ministry of Transport, National Road Safety 
Association, the ANWB (Dutch equivalent to the AAA in the 
U.S.), Team Alert (the young drivers association), the Road 
Safety Research Institute, various regional authorities, and 
the law enforcement community (primarily the police).  Given 
the already robust agenda envisioned by the Dutch and limited 
Mission resources, Post efforts will be focused on supporting 
and highlighting Dutch initiatives, where possible.
