REF: STATE 36580 
 
¶1. Post on March 15 delivered reftel demarche to the New 
Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID).  Jane 
Coster of NZAID on June 9 reported that the New Zealand 
government has allocated NZ $2 million (US $1.4 million, NZD 
1.00 = USD .7145) for Iraqi reconstruction for the fiscal 
year 2005-6.  The government has not yet decided which 
programs will be funded by that allocation. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The New Zealand government disbursed NZ $5.2 
million (US $3.7 million) for Iraq assistance in 2003-4 and 
NZ $2 million in 2004-5, or a total of NZ $7.2 million (US 
$5.1 million).  It spent in Iraq about NZ $300,000 (US 
$214,350) less than the NZ $5.5 million (US $3.9 million) it 
had pledged at the Madrid Donors' Conference because of the 
amount of time that the New Zealand engineering group, 
involved in reconstruction activities in Iraq, had to spend 
in bunkers.  The remaining funds were transferred for use by 
New Zealand's Provincial Reconstruction Team in Bamyan, 
Afghanistan.
