SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON THE EXPORT OF U.S. DEFENSE ARTICLES CITING THE CANADIAN 
EXEMPTION 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on transactions citing the 
Canadian exemption for the export of thermal imaging systems 
to Canada.  Embassy is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Under ITAR 126.5 (Canadian Exemption), 
certain United States Munitions List (USML) items may be 
exported to Canada without a license.  Some items on USML 
Category XII - which includes thermal imaging devices - may 
require a license depending on commodity specification and 
type.  DDTC requests this check based on the vague 
description of commodity and end-use in export filing.  Also, 
End-user VIH Aviation Group has appeared on a previous DDTC 
license but the company's bona fides have not been 
established by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION OTTAWA: Mission Canada is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate officials to establish the bona 
fides of end-user VIH Aviation Group and to obtain all 
relevant details regarding the export of thermal imaging 
systems to Canada citing the Canadian exemption, including 
the exact description, number, type, dollar value, and serial 
number of items.  PM/DTCC also requests that post conducts a 
site visit to the company in order to provide Department with 
an assessment of its business operations and on-site 
security.  Finally, post is asked to assess whether the 
company appears to be a reliable recipient of USML items.  If 
a site visit is not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC 
officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--What were the exact United States Munitions List (USML) 
articles exported to you?  (Automated Export System (AES) 
filing data provides the following information, "thermal 
imaging systems".) 
 
--What is the exact end-use for these USML items?  Will VIH 
Aviation Group be the sole end-user and retain positive 
control over the thermal imaging systems at all times?  Will 
they be transferred to other end-users in Canada or 
re-exported? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--When was the company established and who are its 
principals? 
 
--What is the nature of the company's business? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer 
and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
