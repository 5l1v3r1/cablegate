SUBJECT: CORRECTED: NATO SECRETARY GENERAL STATEMENT ON 
RUSSIAN EXPULSION OF TWO NATO DIPLOMATS 
 
REF: USNATO 178 
 
¶1. (U) On May 6 NATO Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer 
released the following statement regarding Russian revocation 
of diplomatic status of two Canadian NATO diplomats in the 
NATO Information Office in Moscow: 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
The Canadian Ambassador in Moscow, who provides the 
diplomatic status to the Director and Deputy Director of the 
NATO Information Office in Moscow, was called today to the 
Russian Foreign Ministry and informed that the diplomatic 
status of the Director and Deputy Director has been revoked. 
 
Since that status is part of the NATO Russia Memorandum of 
Understanding which establishes the Information Office, the 
action effectively ends the mission of these two NATO 
officials in Moscow and, since they are the only 
International Staff of the Office, the work of the Office 
will continue but will be significantly affected. 
 
The NATO Information Office in Moscow contributes to the 
development of greater public understanding within Russia on 
Russia-NATO relations, and serves as the focal point for 
disseminating information within Russia on NATO's role and 
activities. 
 
As was agreed at the recent Strasbourg-Kehl Summit, NATO has 
recently decided to reengage Russia.  This decision stands. 
The Russian measure is very unfortunate and counterproductive 
to our efforts to restore our dialogue and cooperation with 
Russia.  Thus NATO very much regrets the Russian action and 
does not consider there to be any justification for it.
