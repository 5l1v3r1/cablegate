SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND SAS RETURNS TO AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  On August 10, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key 
announced that his country's elite SAS will be re-deployed to 
Afghanistan.  He also stated that the New Zealand-led PRT will, over 
the next three to five years, draw down its military component and 
increase its civilian contribution to focus more on reconstruction 
and capacity building.  Key revealed that New Zealand will establish 
a permanent diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, transferring that 
responsibility from its mission in Tehran.  While he refuted any 
suggestion of US pressure in arriving at these decisions, many NZ 
observers will interpret Key's announcement as a dramatic commitment 
to build a stronger and more positive relationship with the United 
States.  End Summary. 
 
Government Announces New Afghanistan Deployments 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  On August 10, Prime Minister John Key announced that his 
Government would soon return New Zealand's SAS special forces to 
Afghanistan and began a three to five year process of shifting its 
highly regarded Bamyan PRT from a military peace keeping to a 
civilian reconstruction emphasis.  In the traditional post-Cabinet 
press conference Key stated that New Zealand has a direct and vital 
interest in supporting international efforts to eradicate terrorism 
and promote peace and stability.  Key then outlined the various ways 
in which New Zealand will contribute to these efforts. 
 
NZ Special Forces to Return to Afghanistan 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU)  PM Key announced that up to 70 of New Zealand's elite SAS 
will return to Afghanistan beginning as soon as possible.  He said 
the troops would be deployed for up to 18 months, in three rotations. 
 Key noted that this new deployment "follows decisions by the 
previous Labour government to deploy the SAS to Afghanistan on three 
separate occasions."  Asked by a journalist whether the GNZ would 
consider extending its SAS commitment to Afghanistan beyond 18 
months, Key replied that he believes the situation will improve and 
therefore not warrant an extension.  Key emphasized that the SAS will 
be under NZ command and will reserve the right not to participate in 
operations. 
 
NZ PRT to Drawdown, Civilian Presence to Increase 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Key also announced that the NZ Defence Force (NZDF) 
contingent of the NZ-run provincial reconstruction team (PRT) in 
Bamyan province will be drawn down in the medium term, which he 
defined as three to five years.  As NZDF contingent in the PRT draws 
down, the civilian contribution will increase and focus on rebuilding 
local capacity in agriculture, education and health.  Key noted that 
he hoped the drawdown period could be shorter, but had been advised 
by the NZDF that the 3 to 5 year timeline was more realistic. 
 
NZ PRT to Align with US Capacity Building Policy 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Key promised that NZ's efforts in Bamyan province would "be 
aligned with the new policy of the Obama Administration, which 
includes building the capacity of the Afghanistan central government 
and provincial governments."  This re-alignment of the PRT's work, 
Key added "will include helping build the capacity of the Afghan 
National Police to facilitate an accelerated transfer of the lead 
security role in Bamyan to the police and a phased reduction in NZDF 
personnel over time." 
 
Captured Detainees Given to Afghan Authorities 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Any detainees captured by NZ armed forces will be handed 
directly to Afghan authorities, announced Key.  Key reminded 
assembled media that Afghanistan is a signatory to the Geneva 
Conventions and revealed that its Government had provided the GNZ a 
formal assurance that detainees would be treated humanely.  In the 
past week, NZ media have reported that some detainees captured during 
 
WELLINGTON 00000260  002 OF 002 
 
 
previous SAS deployments to Afghanistan had been denied their rights 
under the Geneva Conventions after they were handed over to U.S. 
forces. 
 
NZ to Establish Diplomatic Presence in Afghanistan 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶7. (SBU)  Finally, Key stated that the GNZ will establish a permanent 
diplomatic presence in Afghanistan.  Presently, NZ's Embassy in 
Tehran covers Afghanistan.  Key released no further details on this 
matter at the press conference. 
 
A Welcome Decision, but No Pressure 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶8. (SBU)  In response to a question from a journalist, PM Key said 
that his government had informed the U.S. of its deployment plans, 
but he strongly refuted any suggestion that New Zealand had received 
pressure from the USG.  Instead, Key painted a stark picture of the 
risk of international terrorism to all nations including New Zealand. 
 New Zealand had no choice but to join the international effort as 
terrorist attacks spread from the United States to London to the 
nearby resort of Bali. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Comment:  Key's announcement will be clearly understood by 
New Zealand observers as a dramatic demonstration of his commitment 
to a stronger and more positive relationship with the United States. 
End Comment.
