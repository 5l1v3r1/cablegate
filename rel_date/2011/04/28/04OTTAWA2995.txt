SUBJECT: CANADA: SUPPORTING ISRAEL'S MEMBERSHIP IN 
CONSULTATIVE GROUPS AT SELECTED UN AGENCIES 
 
REF: STATE 235219 
 
¶1.  Poloff delivered the demarche (per reftel) on support for 
Israel's full, active membership in both Group B at the World 
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the Industrial 
Market Economy Countries (IMEC) at the International Labor 
Organization (ILO), to Peter Taylor, Deputy Director of the 
United Nations and Commonwealth Affairs Division at Foreign 
Affairs Canada (FAC), on November 3. 
 
¶2.  Regarding WIPO, Taylor indicated that the Government of 
Canada (GOC) had not yet been approached by Israel on the 
question of membership.  Although FAC considered our demarche 
as prima facie evidence that Israel was in fact seeking full 
membership in Group B, he said the GOC would defer 
consideration of a decision until a request for support was 
made by Israel. 
 
¶3.  Concerning membership in the ILO IMEC, Taylor informed 
poloff that Israel had already approached the GOC in support 
of their membership bid.  However, Taylor advised that Canada 
could not take a "forward position," emphasizing that the 
GOC, as current chair of the IMET, should remain neutral on 
this issue.
