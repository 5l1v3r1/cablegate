¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  It is unclear whether Ontario will meet its 
2006 commitment to phase out shipments of municipal trash to 
Michigan by the end of 2010 (reftel).  The Province has yet to 
release up-to-date figures for the last two years, despite 
assurances that the effort is on track.  As part of its waste 
diversion strategy, Ontario's Ministry of Environment has proposed 
an extended producer responsibility (EPR) framework.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) An Ontario official told Post on February 8 that the 
Province is still on target to meet its commitment to eliminate 
shipments of municipal solid waste to Michigan by the end of 2010. 
However, when Post asked for data reflecting the Province's 
assertions that they would meet the 2010 deadline on February 2, 
and again on February 8, Provincial officials declined to provide 
updated data on waste shipments to Michigan.  Provincial 
environmental officials admitted in a February 1 meeting that it 
had been "a while" since they briefed Michigan Congressional staff 
on the status of Ontario's efforts to phase-out garbage shipments. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Roughly half of Ontario's trash comes from the Greater 
Toronto Area (GTA).  Shipments of waste from the City of Toronto 
(at the center of the GTA) to Michigan began in 1998, and increased 
when Toronto's only active landfill closed in 2002.  In late 2009, 
Toronto announced that it would not reach a 70% waste diversion 
target it set for 2010, partly due to a protracted civic strike in 
the summer of 2009. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In order to facilitate waste diversion, Ontario is moving 
towards an extended producer responsibility (EPR) framework, where 
those who manufacture products and their packaging are responsible 
for managing the associated waste.  The comment period for the 
Province's EPR proposal closed on February 1, 2010.
