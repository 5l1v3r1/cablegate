SUBJECT: NZ MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PSI "LEADING 
EDGE" EXERCISE 
 
 
Classified By: Political-Economic Counselor Katherine B. Hadda, 
for reasons 1.4(b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) This message contains an action request, at para 4. 
 
¶2.  (C) On June 22, Pol-Econ Couns was called into the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) by Michael 
Swain, Deputy Director of the Security Policy Division, and 
Nik Green, Policy Officer.  Swain explained that GNZ 
officials remain unable to confirm attendance at the 
US-hosted PSI table top exercise "Leading Edge" later this 
year.  The officials hope to attend, but have not yet 
completed their country's national action plan, which they 
believe is a prerequisite for the exercise.  Without the 
plan, New Zealand is unclear on which ministry has legal 
authority to perform various aspects of the events that will 
be simulated in the exercise. 
 
¶3.  (C) Noting that the U.S. side had asked New Zealand to 
confirm its attendance in "Leading Edge" by May 31, Swain 
said that it was unlikely New Zealand would have its action 
plan in place before August.  GNZ wonders if it could confirm 
its attendance at that time.  Swain and Green also stressed 
that GNZ remains completely committed to the success of PSI 
even if New Zealand is unable to participate in "Leading 
Edge," either because it has missed the response deadline or 
because the NZ national action plan will not be completed in 
time.  Swain added that GNZ is taking its signals from us on 
what it needs to do to be successful in PSI.  It would be 
helpful for GNZ to know whether in fact US officials believe 
the action plan is necessary for the exercise.  Swain said 
that NZ Embassy officials in Washington are also passing this 
message through OSD. 
 
¶4.  (C) Action Request:  Please advise post whether or not 
the national action plan is a prerequisite for the "Leading 
Edge" exercise as well as whether GNZ still has time to 
respond positively to the invitation to participate.
