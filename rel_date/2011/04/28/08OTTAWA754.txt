(SBU)  ESTH Counselor delivered reftel demarche to and 
discussed it with Natural Resources Canada's acting Director 
for Uranium and Radioactive Waste David McCauley on June 6. 
McCauley had no specific reactions to the non-paper, but 
noted his personal belief that Canada had little choice but 
to join the Convention to limit the exposure of Atomic Energy 
Canada, Limited.  McCauley said the Canadian federal 
government interagency is discussing signing the Convention 
and that our paper would be helpful in those discussions.  He 
was unable to suggest a timeframe within which the government 
might reach a decision on joining the Convention.
