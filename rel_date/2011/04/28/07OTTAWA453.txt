¶1. (U)  Foreign Minister Mackay announced how the Canadian 
government is implementing UNSCR 1737 on the Islamic Republic 
of Iran's nuclear program on February 27.  In a press 
statement, he said that "the Government of Canada has 
satisfied its obligations and is fully implementing 
Resolution 1737, which is intended to bring about the 
verifiable suspension of Iran's uranium enrichment program. 
Canada believes that if Iran wishes to regain the confidence 
of the international community, as represented by the 
Security Council, it must earnestly submit to the 
requirements of Resolution 1737." 
 
¶2. (U)  On February 22, the Governor General in Council made 
new regulations, under the United Nations Act, called the 
Regulations Implementing the United Nations Resolution on 
Iran.  The regulations went into effect that day.  The text 
of the regulations was published in the Canada Gazette on 
March 7 and can be found at http://canadagazette.gc.ca/partII 
/2007/20070307/html/sor44-e.html. 
 
¶3. (U) Together with relevant provisions of the Canada 
Shipping Act, the Export and Import Permits Act and the 
Nuclear Safety and Control Act, the regulations enable Canada 
to fully implement in Canadian law the sanctions mandated by 
UNSCR 1737.  They impose an embargo on certain goods and 
services that could contribute to Iran's activities linked to 
enrichment, reprocessing, heavy water or the development of 
nuclear weapons delivery systems.  They also address an 
assets freeze and a travel notification requirement.  The 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) 
informed Canadian financial institutions on February 27 of 
their obligation to freeze the assets of individuals or 
entities listed in the UNSCR.
