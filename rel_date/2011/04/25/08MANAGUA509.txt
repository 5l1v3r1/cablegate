Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli for reasons 1.4 b & d. 
 
¶1. (U) On April 11, we met with the Foreign Ministry's 
(MINREX) Director for North America, Rene Morales, and Nelly 
Beteta, Director for Africa and the Middle East, to deliver 
points and non-papers as instructed per reftels.  Beteta 
indicated that the Government of Nicaragua supported Iran's 
peaceful pursuit of nuclear technology, and would assist Iran 
where possible; however, she noted that GON support would end 
if Iran's activities when beyond this goal.  Beteta said she 
would familiarize herself with the names on the travel ban 
list as well as the named companies involved in supporting 
Iran's nuclear program.  In response to her question about 
whether the travel ban applied only to entry of Nicaragua, we 
explained that, as a Security Council Resolution, the travel 
ban applied to all UN member states, not just Nicaragua. 
Beteta did not reply to questions about whether Nicaragua's 
recent executive order granting visa-free access to Nicaragua 
for Iranians would affect the GON's ability to monitor the 
travel of any of the named individuals.  (ref D) 
 
¶2. (C) Beteta said that several Iranian delegations had 
visited Nicaragua in recent months.  She explained that these 
had been purely commercial groups comprised of private 
investors seeking investment opportunities in Nicaragua.  She 
added that an Iranian delegation was in Managua recently to 
present a proposal to Nicaragua's Ministry of Energy and 
Mines for a GON plan to develop a hydroelectric project in 
the Atlantic Region. She observed that the Iranian proposal 
was unlikely to win out as it did not stack up well against 
proposals made by investor groups from Mexico, Brazil and 
Italy.
