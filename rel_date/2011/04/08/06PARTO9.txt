¶4.  (C) SUMMARY.  In a February 23 meeting at his 
official residence, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri told 
the Secretary that he did not see any other way except 
through dialogue to address a wide range of issues 
facing Lebanon.  He expressed dismay that some 
politicians questioned his initiative to launch a 
national dialogue on March 2.  If other political 
leaders insisted on a delay or on sending subordinates, 
Berri preferred cancelling the dialogue.  On the issue 
of replacing President Lahoud, Berri said that he sided 
with the Maronite Patriarch on a peaceful and legal 
transition, with the question of who should be Lebanon's 
new president addressed first by the Christians.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------- 
DIALOGUE ONLY WAY FORWARD 
------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Speaker Berri opened the meeting by listing what 
he described as critical issues facing Lebanon: 
implementation of UNSCR 1559, the investigation into 
Hariri's murder, any international tribunal to describe 
murder suspects, demarcation of the Syrian-Lebanese 
border, and the exchange of diplomatic relations with 
Syria.  He explained that he did not see any other way 
except dialogue, based on the 1989 Taif accord that 
ended Lebanon's civil war, to address these issues. 
 
¶6.  (C) Thus, Berri explained, he has proposed a March 
2-9 national dialogue, to be held "seven days and seven 
nights," complete with sleeping arrangements and meals, 
for parliamentary bloc leaders.  Without such a 
dialogue, some parliamentary bloc leaders would not meet 
and not talk.  He claimed to have received support for 
his initiative from Qatar, Egypt, Russia, the United 
 
PARTO 00000009  002 OF 002 
 
 
States (through the Ambassador), and France.  "All want 
to see dialogue," Berri said. 
 
----------------------------- 
DISMAYED THAT SOME WANT DELAY 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C)  Yet Lebanese Forces leader Samir Ja'ja' and 
Druse leader Walid Jumblatt have both hinted that they 
want to delay the dialogue.  Berri said that their 
desire to remove the president first made no sense.  If 
President Lahoud is removed, then the cabinet also 
becomes, constitutionally, a caretaker cabinet.  Both 
the president and the cabinet must be replaced.  In 
Berri's view, there is no reason to have a dialogue in 
that place.  He said that, if people insist on a delay 
of his dialogue, "I prefer to cancel it."  Berri also 
noted that he insists on parliamentary bloc leaders, not 
substitutes, in the dialogue.  Any subordinate, he 
explained, would not be able to take decisions until 
conferring with his leadership. 
 
-------------------------- 
STANDING WITH PATRIARCH 
REGARDING REPLACING LAHOUD 
-------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (C) As for replacing President Emile Lahoud, Berri 
said that he did not understand the sudden push. 
Lahoud's credibility was lost long ago.  Moreover, 
because of Lebanon's parliamentary calendar, the March 
14 deadline for his resignation announced by the March 
14 coalition did not make sense -- parliament could not 
meet in plenary session before March 21.  Moreover, the 
March 14 coalition did not have the two-thirds needed 
for a parliamentary quorum to replace the president. 
 
¶8.  (C) The Secretary noted that there seems to be a 
strong sense in Lebanon that now is the time to move on. 
While legal and peaceful means should be pursued, 
President Lahoud has lost the confidence of the 
international community and of the Lebanese people. 
Berri said that he stands with the Patriarch.  The 
president must be the president for all of Lebanon, but 
he must have a special relationship with the Maronites. 
Berri said that he supported Cardinal Sfeir's positions 
that peaceful and legal means must be used and that who 
comes next should be clear in advance.  "I'm against 
doing anything by force," Berri said.  The Secretary 
noted that the Patriarch's position that the president 
must be for all of the Lebanese is an important message. 
Yes, Berri agreed, "but the Christians must move first. 
I have to respect the choice of the Christians and the 
Maronites in particular."
