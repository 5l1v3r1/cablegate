SUBJECT: NETHERLANDS/YEMEN: VIEWS FOR LONDON MEETING
REF: SECSTATE 6940
Classified By: DCM Edwin Nolan for reasons 1.4(b,d)
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The Dutch welcome the January 27 London
conference on Yemen, and FM Verhagen and Development Minister
Koenders will encourage President Saleh to keep his promise
of promoting dialogue in Yemen. END SUMMARY.
¶2. (C) Poloff discussed reftel points with Herman Quarles,
Deputy Director for Middle East Affairs at the Dutch MFA, who
strongly welcome the London conference, particularly the
broad focus on the root causes of terrorism and instability.
Quarles observed that Yemen and the Gulf Cooperation Council
have not supported productive discussions in the past,
identifying the situation as a regional or purely internal
problem. However, President Saleh is "getting weaker and
weaker." Without internal reforms, Al Qaeda will find
greater support with the local population.
¶3. (C) With their interventions in London, Ministers Koenders
and Verhagen will encourage President Salah to follow up on
his promise of dialogue. The Dutch had just received, but
not reviewed, the UK’s draft chairman’s statment. Reacting
to reftel points, Quarles said the Dutch shared Germany’s
view that we should not "cheer" Saleh but rather encourage
him to support reform. It would be counterproductive to give
Yemen "a blank check." The Dutch do not see the London
meeting as a pledging conference. (NOTE: The Dutch
government provides Yemen with approximately 25 million euros
in annual development aide, targeting water resources,
health, and education. END NOTE.)
