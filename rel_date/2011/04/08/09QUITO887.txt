Dialogue 
 
REF: QUITO 704; QUITO 223 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Heather Hodges, Ambassador; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  In an October 15 meeting with the Ambassador, MFA 
Under Secretary Orbe stressed that Ecuador remained committed to 
improving relations with Colombia, but said the process had moved 
faster than the GOE had expected.  He seemed frustrated with the 
setback caused by an Ecuadorian judge's arrest order against 
Colombian military chief Padilla, but he believed that the process 
would continue.  Orbe promised to follow up on our proposal for 
counternarcotics cooperation under a "Gas-and-Go" arrangement, 
which is still in the hands of Security Minister Carvajal.  The 
Ambassador and Orbe also reviewed progress in planning for the 
November Bilateral Dialogue meeting.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DEFINING AN AGENDA FOR ECUADOR-COLOMBIA RELATIONS 
 
¶2.  (C) MFA Under Secretary of Bilateral Affairs Jorge Orbe 
emphasized that the GOE wanted to establish an agenda of "peace and 
development" with Colombia and pursue confidence-building measures. 
He said that the GOE was pleased with the mediation provided by the 
Organization of American States (OAS) and the Carter Center, 
especially the former.  He stressed that it was important for 
Colombia to understand that Ecuador did not want narco-politics, 
and then asserted that former Under Secretary of Government Ignacio 
Chauvin (Ref B) committed his illegal acts in cooperation with the 
FARC after he left government. 
 
¶3.  (C) Orbe confirmed that FM Fander Falconi and President Correa 
had a sincere desire to re-establish bilateral relations with 
Colombia, and that the Correa administration had been careful at 
the highest levels to avoid antagonistic rhetoric that could 
jeopardize forward progress.  However, he stated that the recent 
progress on re-establishing bilateral relations had gone faster 
than the GOE had imagined or even wanted. 
 
¶4.  (C) Orbe added that both governments had a responsibility to 
respond to the interests of their people to improve political and 
commercial ties.  Orbe suggested that the current political 
environment was more conducive to a rapprochement, as Ecuador was 
no longer in a campaign mode and Uribe had go-ahead to run for 
election again and had less need to worry about FTA passage in the 
U.S. Congress. 
 
COMMISSION MEETINGS POSITIVE 
 
¶5.  (C) Orbe observed that recent meetings with the GOC had been 
positive, giving as an example Defense Minister Ponce's meeting 
with his counterparts on October 9 in Ipiales.  He stated that the 
GOE was pleased that Colombia was planning on releasing the 
information on the Raul Reyes computers to Ecuador via the OAS.  He 
highlighted the three commissions established by the two foreign 
ministers in Ipiales on October 9: Security and Crime Control (led 
for the GOE by Justice Minister Nestor Arbito), Border Development 
(led for the GOE by Orbe), and Sensitive Considerations (led by the 
foreign ministers). 
 
¶6.  (C) Orbe asserted that, despite press reports to the contrary, 
the October 16 and November 3 Bilateral Border Commission 
(COMBIFRON) meetings in Ibarra and the October 22 Border 
Development Commission meeting in Ipiales would take place as 
planned.  However, the Embassy confirmed with Orbe's assistant on 
October 16 that the meetings had indeed been postponed. 
 
LEGAL CASE AGAINST GENERAL PADILLA 
 
¶7.  (C) On the arrest warrant filed by Sucumbios Province Public 
Prosecutor Jimenez containing charges against Colombian Armed 
Forces chief Freddy Padilla, Orbe reiterated Ecuador's official 
mantra that the judicial branch has the power to pursue such a case 
independent of the Executive.  Separately, Defense Minister Javier 
Ponce stated publicly on October 15 that "the action of the judge 
is unfortunate, as it makes the re-establishment of relations (with 
Colombia) more difficult." 
 
¶8.  (S/NF) Orbe expressed frustration that every time progress was 
made in the bilateral relationship, something happened to derail 
 
 
 
that process.  He speculated that some individuals in the GOE might 
have been responsible for this last derailment.  NOTE: Separately, 
working level contacts at the Prosecutor General's office told us 
that a representative from the Presidency and the ministries of 
Government and Justice traveled to Sucumbios to encourage the 
prosecutor to initiate legal action against Padilla.  However, we 
find this assertion odd given that the highest levels of the GOE 
very publicly committed to improve the relationship.  Sucumbios 
province Judge Francisco Revelo will review the possibility of an 
extradition request to the GOC to send Padilla to Ecuador.  END 
NOTE. 
 
USG ASSISTANCE IN IMPROVING ECUADOR-COLOMBIA RELATIONS 
 
¶9.  (C) The Ambassador recalled for Orbe that FM Falconi had 
suggested on August 5 (Ref A) that the USG could help improve 
communication between Ecuador and Colombia, and asked Orbe for 
suggestions.  Orbe said that the USG could: 1) help Colombia gain 
confidence in their bilateral mechanisms, such as the Bilateral 
Border Commission (COMBIFRON), and in the GOE commitment to the 
warming of relations; 2) assist in addressing the humanitarian 
situation of the Colombian refugees in the northern border region 
of Ecuador with programs of integration and alternative 
development; and 3) help Colombia be more effective in fighting the 
cultivation of drugs. 
 
¶10.  (C) When the Ambassador raised the ideas of bringing key 
contacts from Colombia to Ecuador and vice versa, and bringing a 
team from Washington to assess possible funding options for the 
northern border region, Orbe did not comment.  The Ambassador 
emphasized that the USG was already contributing to the security 
and development of the northern border region.  She observed that 
Defense Minister Ponce recently appeared more comfortable with the 
assistance we have provided to the Ecuadorian military, such as 
building or improving military detachments along the border.  She 
also emphasized that USAID had several programs to develop economic 
opportunities in the northern border region. 
 
GAS-AND-GO 
 
¶11.  (C) The Ambassador inquired as to the status of GOE 
consideration of the USG's "Gas-and-Go" proposal, an arrangement 
under which the USG would use Ecuadorian airports for refueling of 
counter-narcotics surveillance aircraft without maintaining any 
permanent USG facilities.  She explained that the Embassy had not 
been pressing on the issue due to possible sensitivities in 
connection with the U.S. Defense Cooperation Agreement with 
Colombia.  She stressed that President Correa had responded 
positively to the idea in January, saying, "anything in the name of 
counter-narcotics."  Orbe said that he did not know the status, 
explaining that Security Minister Miguel Carvajal and Defense 
Minister Ponce were in the lead on this decision. 
 
¶12.  (C) The Ambassador observed that, while she could provide no 
assurances, progress on Gas-and-Go could strengthen Ecuador's case 
for renewal of the ATPA.  Orbe responded somewhat angrily that 
Ecuador wanted to lessen the emphasis of narcotics in the bilateral 
relationship, and that the GOE would not be blackmailed with 
regards to the ATPA.  The Ambassador noted the reality was that the 
ATPA came with conditions, but that these included much more than a 
review of counter-narcotics cooperation.  She said that the U.S. 
Congress would review the investment problems encountered by U.S. 
businesses in Ecuador, as well as adherence to IPR standards, among 
other criteria.  She emphasized that she felt that movement on 
Gas-and-Go might help Ecuador's case. 
 
¶13.  (C) Orbe promised to send a note to Security Minister Carvajal 
and to speak personally with Foreign Minister Falconi on 
Gas-and-Go.  The Embassy will follow up with both ministers to 
assess progress. 
 
BILATERAL DIALOGUE 
 
¶14.  (C) The Ambassador said that the USG was waiting for 
confirmation on the dates of November 9 for the Trade and 
Investment Council and November 10 for the Dialogue.  Orbe said 
that the dates should work, but would confirm for us after 
 
 
Falconi's return on October 16.  The Ambassador noted that the USG 
wanted to limit the agenda for the Bilateral Dialogue so that it 
was manageable in one full day, suggesting that the plenary in 
November would not be the last opportunity for engagement. 
 
¶15.  (C) When Orbe asked who would lead the U.S. delegation, the 
Ambassador responded that if Arturo Valenzuela were confirmed by 
the Senate as Assistant Secretary, he would lead the delegation. 
If he were not confirmed, the Ambassador said, another senior WHA 
official would likely lead.  Orbe said that MFA Vice Minister 
Lautaro Pozo, Trade and Integration Vice Minister Julio Oleas, or 
he himself would lead the Ecuadorian delegation.  He added that 
Security Minister Carvajal and Coordinating Minister of Social 
Development Jeannette Sanchez might attend as well.  He said that 
the GOE would be able to confirm attendance once the USG's 
participation was confirmed. 
 
¶16.  (SBU) The Ambassador noted that three of the working groups 
had met, and that the Migratory Issues working group was scheduled 
to meet on October 20.  Orbe suggested a preparatory meeting on 
November 5, to include the Ambassador and higher level GOE 
officials. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶17.  (C) Orbe did not elaborate on his comment that rapprochement 
with Colombia had proceeded faster than "imagined or even wanted." 
In any case, there has been a considerable opening of space for 
renewed dialogue and cooperation between the two countries.  We 
will continue to explore with the GOE how the USG might assist in 
facilitating communication and exchanges between Ecuador and 
Colombia to foster confidence and cooperation.
