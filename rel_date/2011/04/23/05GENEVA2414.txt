SUBJECT: POSSIBLE SURVEILLANCE - US MISSION GENEVA - 04 and 06 OCT 2005

¶1. (U) Post: U.S. Mission Geneva

¶2. (U) Date and Time: 04 Oct 2005, at 11:40 AM and 06 Oct 2005

¶3. (SBU) Summary: A couple was observed in the parking lot of the Domaine de Penthes Museum, approximately 100 meters across from the main entrance of the U.S. Mission. The couple was observed standing behind their vehicle (Golf VW, Geneva plate GE 265 734) with the trunk of the vehicle open. The SD Technician (SDT) noticed a sign in the trunk of the vehicle with the world "Islam" printed in French. After a period of undefined time at the vehicle, the couple went into the museum park area at approximately 1140 and sat down on a bench that gives an unobstructed view of the U.S. Mission and the front gate. The couple subsequently departed the area at 1314 local time. On 06 Oct 2005, at approximately 1300, the SDT sighted the same vehicle in the parking lot of the Domaine de Penthes. The SDT observed the same couple walking in the park. NFI.

¶4. (SBU) Desc: Person #1 - Female, appeared to be Middle Eastern origin, approximately 45 years old, height of 170- 175cm, and long brown hair. No further description was noted. Person #2 - Male, appeared to be of Middle Eastern origin, with gray receding hairline. No further description of the male was given, however, photographs of the male are available on SIMAS #78017. The SDT could not obtain a good photograph of the female. Record checks on the vehicle revealed the owner as Ms. Nemat Mardam-Bey. One of the SDTs identified the man in the photograph as Mr. Hafid Ouardidi [Ouardiri]. A search on the internet indicates Mardam-Bey, along with Mr. Hafid Ouardidi, created a private foundation called "Fondation de lentr-connaissance" or translated as Foundation of the Interknowledge. The foundation was created on the 4th of October 2002 in Geneva and Mr. Ouardidi is the spokesman of the foundation.

¶5. (SBU) Probable Target: U.S. Mission and the front gate.

¶6. (SBU) Post Investigative Action: The SDT could not determine if the couple was in the area to specifically observe the U.S. Mission. The couple did not use binoculars or take any photographs or use a video. However, the appearance of the same couple within two days in the same area could be a possible surveillance on the front gate activity and attempts to observe the Swiss military and local guards habits. This couple has not been observed in the area prior to the 04 Oct 2005. Both incidents are reported on Simas #78017.
