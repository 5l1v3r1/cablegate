Classified By: MULTIPLE SOURCES 

¶1.  (U)  This is an action message.  See paragraphs 2-9. 

¶2.  (U)  The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post assistance in conducting a 
pre-license check on two amendments to previously approved 
Technical Assistance Agreements (TAAs).  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 

¶3.  (U)  Reason for request: TAA 0361-04F pertains to the 
provision of defense services, unclassified defense articles 
and technical data in support of the government of Colombia's 
illicit crop eradication program, through fixed and rotary 
wing aircraft operations, maintenance, training, and 
logistics support.  TAA 4140-08D pertains to the transfer of 
surveillance and security-related defense articles, defense 
services, and unclassified technical data to help maintain 
security in Thailand's southern region.  Both TAAs seek to 
add the same foreign party, Colombian company Vertical de 
Aviacion Ltda.  On TAA 0361-04F, the applicant wishes to add 
Vertical de Aviacion as a sub-licensee for general aircraft 
repair.  On TAA 4140-08D, the applicant wishes to add 
Vertical de Aviacion as a subcontractor to install camera 
systems on helicopters.  A previous amendment to one of these 
TAAs (TAA 0361-04B), sought to add Vertical de Aviacion as a 
licensee for aircraft repair and maintenance, however, this 
request was denied by the Department due to a Blue Lantern 
check that was closed unfavorably (Ref. A-B).  More recently, 
post responded favorably to a Blue Lantern check on the bona 
fides of Vertical de Aviacion as a U.S. registered broker 
(Ref. C-D).  Because of this variance in post responses, 
PM/DTCC wishes to conduct another check in order to resolve 
this discrepancy and also obtain additional information from 
Vertical de Aviacion. 

¶4.  (S//NF)  Ref. A requested post's assessment of classified 
reporting found on Vertical de Aviacion, HelitaxiLtda (the 
former name of Vertical de Aviacion), and its owner, Byron 
Lopez Salazar, alleging corruption, narcotrafficking, and 
money laundering.  Post consulted with the DATT, FBI, 
USMILGROUP, and DEA at embassy, and confirmed the accuracy of 
this reporting (Ref. B). 

¶5.  (U)  According to Jane's and Dun & Bradstreet reports, 
Vertical de AviacionLtda was established in 1982 as Helitaxi
Ltda.  The name of the company was changed to Vertical de 
Aviacion in September 2002.  The president of 
Helitaxi/Vertical de Aviacion is Byron Lopez Salazar (one or 
more of his sons are also involved in this and related 
businesses).  The following are excerpts about Helitaxi, 
Byron Lopez Salazar, and Vertical de Aviacion from 12 reports 
dated 1990-2004 (two of these reports were cited in Ref. A). 

¶6.  (S//NF)  SUBJ: AG INVESTIGATES ALLEGED COMMUNICATIONS 
BETWEEN EX PRESIDENT LOPEZ MICHELSEN AND PABLO ESCOBAR.
Byron Lopez is believed to have criminal contacts. (Ref. E); 
SUBJ: DRUG ACTIVITIES/INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE MELGAR, TOLIMA 
DEPT.  Byron Lopez is the owner of Helitaxi.  The firm was 
once taken over by authorities because it was created with 
monies coming from the drug trade. (Ref. F); SUBJ: HEROIN 
TRAFFICKING.  Helicopters belonging to Helitaxi allegedly 
land in Barua, load drums of unknown type chemicals, and 
transport the drums to the laboratory which is located on a 
ranch.  Reportedly, the helicopter registration numbers are 
removed when they are used for illegal purposes. (Ref. G); 
SUBJ: BASIC DATA ON HELITAXI LTDA, COLOMBIAN COMMERCIAL 
HELICOPTER SERVICE.HelitaxiLtda has a history of 
involvement in drug activities. (Ref. H); SUBJ: HEROIN 
TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES.  Allegedly, two Helicopters 
registered to the Colombian company Helitaxi were used to 
transport the chemicals to the laboratory. (Ref. I); SUBJ: 
AIR INTELLIGENCE.  DEA intelligence suggests that three 
Russian Antonov (AN-74) troop transport/cargo jet aircraft 
recently purchased by HelitaxiLtda, Bogota, Colombia might 
be used to transport drugs. (Ref. J); SUBJ: AIR INTELLIGENCE. 
 Since Feb. 93, reports have addressed recent aircraft 
acquisitions by three Colombian cartel-related air 
transportation companies-- HelitaxiLtda, Aviation Total de 
Colombia, and Aero Tumi in Peru, as well as speculated on 
their possible illicit employment. (Ref. K); SUBJ: NARCOTICS 
TRAFFICKER LEONIDAS VARGAS VARGAS.Aerocafe S.A. is owned by 
Leonidas Vargas Vargas.  Aircraft seized at El Dorado 
International Airport, Bogota, Colombia, was purchased in 
September 1992 by Colombian company HelitaxiLtda on 
Aerocafe's behalf.  The owner of Helitaxi, Byron Lopez, owns 
property in the same area as Nelson Fabio.  In 1991, Helitaxi
possibly sold an aircraft to Aerocafe S.A. (Ref. L); SUBJ: 
RUSSIAN MADE HELICOPTERS IN COLOMBIA.  Past (DEA) reporting 
indicatedHelitaxi possibly may have been involved in drug 
smuggling. (Ref. M); SUBJ: SOURCE LISTS MONEY LAUNDERERS AND 
FRONT MEN.  Carlos Alberto Plata Gomez, an oil industry 
analyst, gave the names of other frontmen and money 
launderers: -- Byron Lopez Salazar; owner of Helitaxi, a 
company that rents the services of helicopters.  Plata 
described Lopez as the biggest money launderer in Colombia, 
laundering money up to USD five billion for the cartel, many 
othernarco groups (including the remnants of the Medellin 
cartel), and emerald miners/dealers.  Plata said Lopez is a 
frontman for Fabio Villegas.  --Uto Saenz, money launderer 
from Pereira who works with Byron Lopez.  --Jesus Guerrero; 
big money launderer, owner of Servientrega delivery service, 
works with Byron Lopez.  --Eduardo Escobar; drug trafficker, 
associate and friend of Byron Lopez. (Ref. N); SUBJ: ALLEGED 
CORRUPTION WITH TIES TO THE PRESIDENCY RELATED TO AVIATION 
REPAIR PARTS CONTRACT.  Byron Lopez, owner of Vertical de 
Aviacion, is the son-in-law of former Colombian president and 
current Secretary General of the OAS, Cesar Gaviria.  As 
early as 1977, Byron Lopez and his former company Helitaxi
have been under suspicion by the DEA for alleged 
narcotrafficking, illicit production of narcotics and money 
laundering.  In 1986, DEA requested a FAA watch on a aircraft 
owned by Lopez for suspicious activity and possible 
transportation of narcotics.  In March 1991, he was alleged 
to have established ties with the Medellin drug cartel.  In 
1994, Lopez drew the attention of the FBI which had Lopez 
under suspicion for alleged narcotrafficking and money 
laundering with known narcotraffickers. (Ref. O); SUBJ: 
COLOMBIAN MI-17 UPGRADES.  Vertical de Aviacionis leasing 
MI-17s to Colombian government in fight against drugs.
Vertical de Aviacion has 400 employees of which 60 are 
Russian. (Ref. P) 

¶7.  (U)  ACTION: PM/DTCC requests post's assessment of Ref. 
A-B and E-O in regards to its accuracy, credibility, and 
currency.  Please seek assistance of all relevant country 
team personnel to review/assess this information. 

¶8.  (U)  Post is also requested to contact Vertical de 
Aviacion.  The U.S. Department of State DDTC Statement of 
Registration brokering application for Vertical de Aviacion
Ltda identifies Fernando Jose Lopez as CEO of the company. 
Lopez signed the brokering application on 01/30/2009. 
Completed application forms are legal documents.  Lopez's 
signature on the form attested to the "Truth of All 
Statements Made Herein Under Penalty According to Federal 
Law".  One required question on the brokering application 
asked if the Registrant (Vertical de AviacionLtda) is Owned 
And/Or Controlled By Foreign Persons.  No response was 
provided to this question.  In fact, Dun & Bradstreet, and 
other sources show that Vertical de AviacionLtda is a 
subsidiary of Icaro International Services S.A. of Panama. 
Icaro International Services owns 80% of Vertical de 
Aviacion.  Thus Fernando Jose Lopez/Vertical de Aviacion is 
potentially in violation of USG federal law.  Request 
Vertical de Aviacion to provide complete street and mailing 
address information for Icaro International Services S.A., 
including phone numbers, points of contact, Panama 
identification and registration numbers.  The government of 
Panama agency and/or commercial/legal office for establishing 
offshore companies that maintains Icaro International 
Services' registration records should also be identified, 
including complete address and contact information.  Vertical 
deAviacion should also provide date of registration, i.e., 
whenIcaro International Services S.A. was established, and 
ownership data (name and address of all public and private 
persons or other entities who own or control any part of 
Icaro).  Lastly, Vertical de Aviacion should identify all 
other companies, businesses, or entities that are partly or 
fully owned by Icaro International Services S.A. 

¶9.  (U)  Additionally, Ref. P and other sources indicate that 
Vertical de AviacionLtda employs a significant number of 
Russian foreign nationals.  According to the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) Parts 124.8 and 125.1, 
technical data or services exported pursuant to a licensed 
agreement may not be transferred or disclosed to foreign 
nationals of another country (other than the country of 
ultimate destination) without prior written approval of DDTC. 
 Ref. D furthermore states that Vertical de Aviacion is 
interested in importing NVGs, a particularly sensitive 
technology.  Due to these ITAR requirements and the potential 
risk of diversion of sensitive technology, please request 
that Vertical de Aviacion provide the full names and 
identification numbers of all the Russian foreign nationals 
currently employed by Vertical de Aviacion and any of its 
co-located companies.  END ACTION.
