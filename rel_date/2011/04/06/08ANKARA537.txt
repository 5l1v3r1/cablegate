¶1. (C) Summary and comment:  Alevi groups are committed to 
ensuring the GOT implements the Council of State's 
(Danistay's) March 3 ruling allowing students to be excused 
from Turkey's mandatory religious courses (ref A).  These 
groups believe the ruling Justice and Development Party's 
(AKP's) criticisms of the decision evince a "selective" 
support of democratic principles; they expect AKP to bury the 
issue for now because of the enormous attention being devoted 
to the AKP closure case (ref B).  Alevis will gather on March 
22 in Ankara to develop strategies to keep the religious 
education issue in the news and on the GOT's agenda.  AKP can 
show genuine committment to protecting freedoms for all Turks 
by moving forward with modern educational reforms that do not 
impose a Sunni-centric views on Alevis and non-Muslims.  End 
summary and comment. 
 
Alevi Groups Say They Won't Be Deterred 
--------------------------------------- 
¶2. (C) Hussein Gazi Association President Ali Yildirim told 
us Turkey's Alevi community is mobilizing to ensure the GOT 
implements the Danistay's March 3 ruling to allow students to 
opt out of required religious education courses.  Yildirim 
believes Minister of Education Huseyin Celik showed AKP's 
"selective use" of the Constitution when he declared the 
document requires all Muslim citizens to take the course. 
Yildirim noted also that Turkey had committed to accepting 
ECHR precedent as superseding Turkish law, including the 
Constitution.  Yildirim dismissed Celik's remark that the MOE 
had overhauled the content and issued new textbooks while the 
cases proceeded, rendering the Danistay and ECHR decisions 
moot.  Both the ECHR and Danistay had rejected the argument 
because the "new" content amounted to a handful of pages 
describing Alevism and other religions from a Sunni 
standpoint.  (Comment:  Our cursory analysis of the new books 
bears out Yildirim's claim.) 
 
¶3. (C) Alevis expect AKP to hide behind their closure case as 
an excuse not to implement the Danistay and ECHR rulings, and 
are therefore determined to keep the issue in the news and on 
the GOT's agenda, Yildirim said.  Alevi groups will gather on 
March 22 at a Pir Sultan Abdul-organized conference to 
discuss possible strategies, including filing criminal 
complaints against the Minister of Education and Diyanet 
President for their recent "discriminatory" remarks, and 
organizing Alevi parents to file thousands of cases in 
Turkish courts and the ECHR. 
 
Alevis Ambivalent About AKP Closure Case 
---------------------------------------- 
¶4. (C) Middle East Technology University (METU) professor 
Aykan Erdemir is monitoring closely the Alevi community's 
reaction to the closure case against AKP.  He told us Alevis 
thus far are ambivalent toward the closure -- on the one hand 
deriving enormous pleasure from this development, on the 
other recalling the many closures against their own radical 
leftist parties.  He expects the heterogeneous Alevi groups 
to have a vocal debate on the issue at the upcoming 
conference.
