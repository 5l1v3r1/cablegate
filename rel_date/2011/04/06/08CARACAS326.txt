Classified By: Robert Downes, Political Counselor, 
for Reason 1.4(d) 
 
¶1. (S)  No additional troop movements have been reported in 
the March 7 open press.  Considering the distances from major 
bases such as Fuerte Paramaracay in Valencia and Carora 
barracks in Lara state, it is reasonable to assume that 
elements of the 41st Armored Brigade, such as the 413th 
"Pedro Leon Torres" Armored Battalion and the 412th 
"Bermudez" Armored Battalion are still en route to their 
forward garrison positions near the Colombian border. Wire 
service photographs indicate that AK-103 assault rifles, from 
the consignment of 100,000 purchased from Russia, have been 
issued to Army units.  Based on open source and sensitive 
reporting, the Venezuelan army remains far from reaching its 
stated deployment of 10 battalions since numerous tanks and 
armored vehicles are still awaiting transport.  There are 
unconfirmed rumors that there may be a public display of more 
troops deploying over the March 8-9 weekend.
