SUBJECT: (C) COLOMBIA'S STRATEGY TO EXPLOIT INFO FROM FARC 
ON VENEZUELA AND ECUADOR 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William R. Brownfield 
Reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1. (C) Defense Minister Santos and Vice Minister of Defense 
(VMOD) Jaramillo told the Ambassador the GOC plans to 
selectively leak information from FARC computers connecting 
Presidents Chavez and Correa and their Governments to the 
FARC over the next 4-6 weeks, as INTERPOL completes its 
verification procedures.  Once verified, the GOC wants 
INTERPOL or another respected international organization to 
publish the materials on a web site.  The GOC plans to 
provide 90 documents to Venezuela and 30 to Ecuador from the 
Reyes materials as early as March 27, but will not provide 
full sets now.  The GOC provided us with full sets of the 
hard drives, but Santos told us they were doing so on the 
condition that we not release any information without first 
consulting with the GOC.   End summary. 
 
GOC STRATEGY FOR REYES INFORMATION 
---------------------------------- 
¶2. (C) Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos told the 
Ambassador generally, and VMOD Sergio Jaramillo more 
specifically March 18, that the GOC plans to use materials 
seized from Raul Reyes' FARC computers to link Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa, 
and their Governments to the terrorist group.  Jaramillo has 
been designated by the GOC to develop the computer 
exploitation strategy.  He emphasized on March 26 that the 
strategy is not yet complete, but 95 percent of its outline 
is clear.  The GOC would wait to dump the data onto a public 
web site until INTERPOL verifies the integrity of the 
computers and no tampering with the information therein, a 
process expected to be completed by late-April. 
 
¶3. (C) In the 4-6 week interim, the GOC plans to selectively 
provide intelligence from the computers to carefully chosen 
North American, Colombian, Spanish, and Latin media tied to 
specific themes.  Jaramillo thought the most logical themes 
were: the FARC and President Chavez, the FARC and President 
Correa, the FARC and drug trafficking, and the FARC and 
hostages.  The GOC would carefully review all material before 
release to filter material that could be damaging to the GOC. 
 
 
¶4. (C) Once INTERPOL completes its review, the GOC intends to 
turn over the Reyes computer materials to an independent 
organization not identified with either the GOC or USG for 
release on a public internet web site.  The GOC would prefer 
that INTERPOL, the OAS, or another respected international 
organization manage the site, but Jaramillo suspected 
INTERPOL and the OAS would be unwilling to host the 
information, and that an NGO will end up with the task. 
 
 
SHARING WITH GOV/GOE 
-------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) Santos said the GOC would provide approximately ninety 
documents from the Reyes computers to Venezuela and thirty 
documents to Ecuador on March 27, but would not provide them 
with full sets of information prior to completion of the 
INTERPOL review. 
 
 
GOC SHARES INFO WITH USG--WITH A CONDITION 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶6. (C) Santos promised us full sets of the hard drives 
(subsequently provided), but emphasized to the Ambassador 
that the GOC was providing the materials on the condition 
that the USG not/not release any information publicly or for 
attribution without prior consultation and agreement with the 
GOC.
