SUBJECT: EGYPTIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD: SUPREME GUIDE AND
PARLIAMENTARY BLOC DYNAMICS (C-NE6-01656)

REF: A. SECSTATE 169790
¶B. CAIRO 5298

Classified By: Minister-Counselor for Economic and Political Affairs
William R. Stewart, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

¶1. (S) This is the first in a series of cables addressing INR
queries (ref A) regarding the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood
(MB). All of Embassy Cairo's reporting on the MB is based on
open sources and second-hand information that poloff obtains
from non-MB members.

SUPREME GUIDE AND MB ORG CHART
------------------------------

¶2. (S) According to Embassy contacts, the MB's Guidance
Council (the organization's supreme decision-making body) is
composed of twelve members (Note: To date, we have been
unable to obtain from our contacts a clear explanation of how
Guidance Council members are chosen. End note). Under the
direction of the Guidance Council, the MB consists of two
overarching organizational wings -- "Da'wa" (the "Call"), and
"Political." Under the auspices of these two branches are
twenty-five "national bureaus" - Economic Affairs,
Parliamentary Department, and Educational Issues, to name a
few. The Supreme Guide is elected by the "Majlis Shoura al
Ikhwan" (Shoura Council of the MB), which is composed of the
twelve members of the Guidance Council, heads of the
twenty-five national bureaus, and various other leading MB
members. The MB Shoura Council reportedly consists of
roughly 100 members.

¶3. (S) In the past, the MB's Supreme Guide was appointed for
life. The previous Supreme Guide, Mohamed Ma'moun al
Hudaibi, died in office, and current Supreme Guide Mohamed
Mehdi Akef succeeded him in 2004. In an April 24 interview
on MBC TV, Akef said that in 1994 the MB changed internal
regulations so that the Supreme Guide's term is limited to
six years, but that he hoped the MB Shoura Council would
approve his proposal to limit the term to just four years.
According to one Embassy contact, Abdel Monem Abouel Fetouh
(MB Guidance Council member), commented recently in a private
conversation that new elections for the Supreme Guide will
occur in 2009, and that Akef can run again, but not in
subsequent elections, as the Supreme Guide is now limited to
only two "terms."

PARLIAMENTARY BLOC DYNAMICS, AND RELATIONSHIP WITH SUPREME
GUIDE
--------------------------------------------- -------------

¶4. (S) Former MP and current Guidance Council member Muhamed
Mursi heads the MB's Parliamentary Department (Note: Mursi
was arrested in May, and remains in detention. End note).
According to our contacts, this Department oversees MB
parliamentary bloc leader Saad El Katatni, and his 87 fellow
MB parliamentarians. The parliamentary bloc's contacts with
the Guidance Bureau and the Supreme Guide are allegedly quite
infrequent. In an interview with Al Ahram Weekly (as
reported in the September 21 issue), Akef stated that, "our
parliamentary bloc works independently of the group. They
don't take orders from us. We give them general guidelines.
The way things work in the Brotherhood is that each sector
enjoys full freedom to carry out their duties within the
Brotherhood's general framework and policy." In response to
a question as to whether he asks the MB bloc to raise certain
issues in parliament, Akef reportedly stated, "Never. I
rarely even see them, perhaps only once a year." Our
contacts report that in their conversations with MB
parliamentarians, the MP's have confirmed that the Supreme
Guide and Guidance Council have only infrequent contact with
them, and do not "give orders" to the MB bloc in parliament.

¶5. (S) As a "team-building" measure of sorts, while
parliament is in session, all MB parliamentarians (even those
from Cairo) reportedly live at the Ma'adi Hotel, located in
an upscale Cairo suburb. This is apparently a new measure
taken following last year's parliamentary elections; given
the five-fold increase in the number of MB parliamentarians,
the MB's small office in Cairo's al-Manyal neighborhood was
no longer large enough for all of the MP's to meet
collectively. According to Embassy contacts, the MB's
parliamentary bloc created a "kitchen," composed of
specialized teams that gather information about issues the
MP's face in Parliament. The "kitchen" also arranges for
outside speakers to lecture to the bloc; during the last
parliamentary session, speakers included Hassan Nafa'a
(chairman of Cairo University's Political Science
Department), Dhia Rashwan (analyst at the Al Ahram Center for
Political and Strategic Studies), Hala Mustafa (member of the
NDP Policies Committee, and editor of Al Ahram's Democracy
Review), and an expert on avian influenza.

¶6. (C) As reported ref B, numerous observers have
complimented the MB parliamentary bloc's discipline. The
bloc elects its own leader and a deputy; the most recent
elections were held on September 23, in which Saad El Katatni
was re-elected as head of the bloc, and Hussain Mohamed as
his deputy. Reportedly, the bloc will also elect a
general-secretary and official spokesperson from among their
number.

MB LEADERS
----------

¶7. (S) Embassy contacts have noted to us the leadership
skills of current Deputy Supreme Guide Mohamed Habib,
highlighting that he is "the brains behind the organization's
current success," and "is really running the show." Habib is
reportedly in his late 50's. Our contacts have also flagged
Abdel Monem Abouel Fetouh (Guidance Council member,
Secretary-General of the Arab Medical Union, widely viewed as
a moderate), Essam el Erian (early 50's, in detention since
May) and Sa'ad Katatni as "stars" of the MB. One contact
noted to poloff that several of the younger (mid-30's)
members of the MB, who are playing key roles (such as the
editor of the MB's English language web-page) are dual
Egyptian-American citizens.
