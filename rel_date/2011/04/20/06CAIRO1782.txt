SUBJECT: DEFMIN TANTAWI ON MFO, PSI, DEMOCRATIC REFORM AND FMF

Classified by Ambassador Francis Ricciardone for reasons
1.4(b) and (d).

¶1. (C) Summary: On March 19, the Ambassador and Defense
Minister Tantawi discussed Iraq, Sudan, the Muslim
Brotherhood (MB), and Tantawi's impressions of his recent
visit to Washington. Tantawi reaffirmed the GOE view that
for now, U.S. troops must remain in Iraq. On his meetings in
Washington, Tantawi said he was concerned by the discussion
about potentially drawing down the U.S. presence in the MFO
and reassured by the Administration's support for maintaining
the current level of FMF. Tantawi also said Egypt is
committed to maintaining strong but "quiet"
counter-proliferation cooperation with the U.S. Tantawi said
formally joining the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI)
would be counter productive as it would certainly arouse
domestic political opposition, particularly from the new
parliament. End summary.

¶2. (C) Regional issues: Defense Minister Tantawi told the
Ambassador during a March 19 meeting that it would be very
dangerous for the U.S. to withdraw its troops before Iraq is
stabilized and that he was reassured by Washington officials'
affirmation that the U.S. has no plans for a sudden
withdrawal. Tantawi also added that there must be a strong
Sunni representation in the new government. On Sudan,
Tantawi said although it is a "headache," it is not as
difficult an issue as Iraq, and Egypt is working to help the
situation.

¶3. (C) Tantawi's impressions of meetings in D.C.: Tantawi
said that Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's reference to
potentially drawing down the U.S. battalion in MFO was
troubling. He explained that Egypt and Israel agree that the
timing for a drawdown -- post Gaza disengagement -- is not
right and added that the U.S. presence gives influence and
credibility to the MFO. He noted with amused satisfaction
that when he had responded in these terms to Secretary
Rumsfeld's suggestion, the Secretary observed that "Egypt and
Israel have the same view" on this. On FMF, Tantawi said he
was pleased with the assurances he received from the
Administration on the need to maintain the same level of
funding for the coming year. Although Tantawi said his
meetings with members of Congress were positive, he expressed
concern over Representative Obey's apparent change of heart.
Tantawi explained that because Obey had always been a
"friend" of Egypt, he was surprised and disappointed to hear
the Congressman raise questions about Egypt's FMF.

¶4. (C) When the Ambassador emphasized the importance of
continuing our strong bilateral cooperation on
counter-proliferation, Tantawi acknowledged that the
Secretary of Defense had urged Egypt to consider the PSI.

Tantawi said that GOE counter-proliferation cooperation is
excellent and cited examples in which the Egyptians agreed to
board and search vessels. Tantawi then explained that the
PSI would not improve cooperation and, because of internal
sensitivities, may actually interfere with it. He
specifically noted the likelihood that the PSI would be
brought to parliament's attention could only undermine our
cooperation. In light of this, Tantawi said, the GOE prefers
to handle interdiction requests on a case by case basis. The
timing is not right to discuss the PSI, he stressed. Tantawi
contended that we can reach PSI's objectives without Egypt's
formal enrollment in the PSI.

¶5. (C) Democratic Reform: Tantawi told the Ambassador that
the GOE is working to strike a balance between openness and
stability. Noting the MB-Hamas link, Tantawi said the GOE is
watching this closely to control, but not crack down on, the
MB. He complained that the MB gets away with criticizing the
GOE extensively and said there is no way to respond. He
invited the Ambassador's "advice." The Ambassador urged the
GOE to use increased openness to advantage -- not necessarily
for "dialogue" with the Islamists but rather for debate:
voices of secular opposition to the MB needed to be heard,
whether from within the ruling party, or from a strengthened
democratic opposition, or both. Tantawi said that this will
all come with time and at a pace appropriate for Egypt. The
Ambassador countered that the MB seems to be advancing its
agenda at a faster pace to meet what appears to be popular
demand for change.
