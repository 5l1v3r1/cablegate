---------------------------------- 
Summary, Action Request and Comment 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Post received a dipnote from the MFA on June 2 
informing the Embassy that the Attorney General's Office was 
requesting the "documentation related to search operations 
that took place in the month of November 2009." The note 
refers to a USCG P-3 that responded to a Panamanian 
Aero-Naval Service (SENAN) request for assistance trying to 
locate a Panamanian pilot who had crashed into the Pacific in 
international waters while flying a helicopter off the 
Venezuelan flagged tuna fishing boat F/V Don Francisco. The 
prosecutor is investigating possible criminal acts in the 
disappearance of Carlos Julio Alvarado, the pilot of the 
helicopter. 
 
¶2.  (U)  Action Request: Post requests guidance for response. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment: This case has been going on for months, 
and the MFA has leaked every official piece of correspondence 
between the Embassy and the MFA and SENAN to the family of 
Mr. Alvarado, who appear to be very upset about the death of 
their son, and unable to accept all indications that his 
helicopter crashed into the sea and sank with him aboard. The 
family members have called Embassy officers on several 
occasions, with the information in the dipnotes and letters 
Post had exchanged with the MFA and SENAN, and have asked the 
USG to search for their missing son again. The only USG 
involvement in this case was one day of P-3 searches for the 
helicopter, which was based on coordinates given to the USCG 
by SENAN.
