Classified By: PolOffJarahnHillsman, Reasons 1.4 (b&d) 

¶1.  (C) Summary:  Ecuadorian military units on February 18 
encountered and dismantled a FARC encampment in the northern 
border province of Sucumbios.  Two FARC trainees were 
captured during the raid, along with weapons, ammunition, and 
other logistical support items.  In the wake of the find, 
Minister of Defense OswaldoJarrin reaffirmed Ecuadorian 
military commitment to safeguard national sovereignty and 
prevent FARC infiltration or incursion of any kind.  The GOE 
is clearly eager to answer GOC criticism that the FARC is 
present and unmolested in Ecuadorian territory.  End Summary. 

FARC Training Camp Dismantled 
----------------------------- 

¶2.  (U) Ecuadorian military units on February 18 briefly 
exchanged fire (no casualties) with  and destroyed a FARC 
encampment in Santa Rosa, Sucumbios province.  The base, 
located near the site of the January 28 Colombian military 
incursion, comprised a series of wooden structures with 
sleeping quarters, kitchens, showers, and some furnishings. 
GOE forces also found four rifles, hand grenades, explosives, 
detonators, food, radios, a generator, oxygen tanks, and 
medication. 

FARC Trainees Captured 
---------------------- 

¶3.  (U) Two FARC trainees captured during the raid told 
Ecuadorian authorities that they were sent to Ecuador to 
study guerrilla philosophy, armed conflict, the story of Che
Guevara, and the principles of the Bolivarian Movement.  They 
are currently being held by Ecuadorian law enforcement 
authorities in Quito.  In a separate operation, seven 
indigenousCofan Ecuadorian nationals suspected of 
collaborating with the FARC were also detained and later 
released by military units in la BarrancaBermeja, Sucumbios. 

MOD Vows to Protect Sovereignty 
------------------------------- 

¶4.  (U) Minister of Defense OswaldoJarrin on February 20 
confirmed the incident had occurred, adding that GOE 
considers illegal armed elements &a threat to national 
sovereignty that would be neutralized with force.8  Jarrin
said that GOE operations are not conducted jointly with the 
Colombian military.  The MOD again rejected the notion, 
promoted recently by President Uribe, that illegal armed 
groups stage attacks against Colombian military units from 
Ecuador. 

Comment 
------- 

¶5.  (C) NAS-purchased vehicles were used by the 19th jungle 
Brigade to move the patrol units into the area and MILGRP 
donated rations were consumed by soldiers on patrol.  USG 
support for Ecuadorian military, especially at the 
operational level, is beginning to produce desired outcomes 
in the border region.  While USG resources remain a key 
ingredient, this uncharacteristically aggressive move was 
probably motivated by the GOE's desire to demonstrate 
unequivocal rejection of a FARC presence, in the face of 
criticism from Colombia.
