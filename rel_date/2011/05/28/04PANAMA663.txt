(S/NF) On March 12, PolOff delivered ref talking points to 
GOP Public Security and National Defense Council (Consejo) 
Executive Secretary Ramiro Jarvis.  On March 19, Jarvis 
delivered GOP reply resulting from its full Consejo meeting 
on March 15, chaired by Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso. 
The GOP concurs with our concern surrounding North Korea's 
purchase of commodities that can be used or modified for use 
in North Korea's nuclear program.  The GOP accepts its role 
for stopping the transit of such commodities; Panama does not 
produce those commodities.  Jarvis reported Moscoso's 
approval of a review of Panamanian Law to determine the 
parameters of the GOP's authority over transshipments, and 
noted Panama's general cooperation with and work on the 
Transshipment Export Controls Initiative (TECI) and other 
security-related initiatives, e.g., Export Control and 
Related Border Security Assistance (EX-BIS) Program, 
Container Security Initiative (CSI) and Proliferation 
Security Initiative (PSI), as applicable in this specific 
case.  Jarvis agreed to present in April a GOP report to 
Embassy on its initiatives and short-/long-term goals that 
Panama believes will allow it to take action on ref 
commodities of concern destined for North Korea.
