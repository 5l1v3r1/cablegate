PANAMA 00001662  004.6 OF 004 
 
 
much (if not more) of a referendum on his administration than 
on the merits of the Canal project.  However, the GOP has 
done little in recent months to boost public trust in the 
government's anti-corruption bona fides, in general, and on 
the Canal project's cost estimates, in particular.  A number 
of AmCham members recently groused to the Ambassador and 
other Emboffs that the GOP and the Panama Canal Authority 
continue to fumble the PR campaign for the "Yes" vote and 
have allowed opponents to seize the momentum.  Recent 
episodes, such as Torrijos' recent ouster of Bank 
Superintendent Delia Cardenas (ref B) and a recent change in 
Panama's capital gains tax law that enabled Banistmo's 
well-connected shareholders to avoid some $400 million in 
taxes, may exacerbate the public's mistrust of the GOP and 
strengthen the hand of Canal expansion opponents. 
 
Â¶14. (S)  We share Torrijos' concern about the growing 
traction of the "no" forces, which were, until recently, 
virtually discounted.  In today's politically charged 
environment, every action, including those of the Embassy, is 
analyzed in microscopic and sensationalized detail.  It is in 
the U.S. interest that the Panama Canal be expanded to 
maintain and enhance its utility to global maritime commerce. 
 We are engaging key opposition leaders and other forces to 
take their pulse on this matter of Panamanian national 
importance.  We will urge them to clarify their positions and 
show leadership.  End comment.
