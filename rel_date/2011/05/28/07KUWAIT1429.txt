Kuwait calls on Iranian cooperation with IAEA 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶1.  (U) On September 19, the Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) 
reported that the Amir of Kuwait Shaykh Sabah Al-Ahmad 
Al-Jaber Al Sabah urged neighboring Iran to cooperate with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  He was quoted 
as saying, "We believe in the importance of reaching a 
peaceful solution, but at the same time we call on the 
Iranian officials to extend full cooperation to the IAEA." 
According to KUNA and other press outlets, the Amir also 
called for making the Gulf and the Middle East free of WMDs, 
but remarked that countries have the right to possess nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes. 
 
Meanwhile... 
------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Also, on September 19, Iranian Ambassador to Kuwait 
Ali Jannati penned an opinion piece in Al-Rai Al-Aam (an 
independent, moderate daily) that declared the following 
translated/paraphrased remarks: 
 
-Iran's claim to peaceful energy 
--------------------------------- 
 
--Having peaceful nuclear technology is a legitimate right 
for all states. 
--The non-civilian use of nuclear energy is prohibited 
according to Shari'a (Islamic law). 
--Iranian interest in nuclear energy is based on the desire 
for clean and cheap energy pending the depletion of oil 
reserves. 
--Iran is established as a nuclear power and is ready to 
extend to Gulf and Islamic countries a helping hand to 
establish nuclear capabilities. 
--Iran has given guarantees to reassure the world of its 
peaceful intent.  Opponents are politicizing the issue to 
advance their agendas and are exercising double standards 
(with Israel) for obtaining nuclear power.  Lying and 
fabricating have become systematic policies for the American 
government. 
--Iranian negotiations with the IAEA have never been 
disrupted. 
--Gulf states have always supported Iran's nuclear program 
 
-If the U.S. attacks 
--------------------- 
 
Jannati continued: 
 
--America is using scare tactics to steer Arab and Islamic 
public opinion against Iran and to undermine IAEA/EU 
negotiations.  Iran takes seriously a possible U.S. military 
strike and is equipped and ready to combat such aggression. 
At the same time, though, Iran estimates that the American 
offensive capability is weak due to its languishing in the 
Iraqi quagmire. 
--If attacked, Iran will retaliate against the launch sites 
where the attack originated. 
--America is demonizing Iran so it can launch an arms race in 
order to market American weaponry. 
 
-Iraq and Gulf neighbors 
------------------------ 
 
--Iranian-Iraqi relations are positive, and Iran supports the 
Iraqi government and people. 
--America is scapegoating Iran with charges of causing 
sectarianism in Iraq to avoid its responsibility for its 
failure in Iraq. 
--Iran maintains a positive relationship with the U.A.E., but 
asserts its claims to the three disputed islands in the Gulf. 
 
--The Kingdom of Bahrain is a sovereign and independent 
state, and Iran denies claims asserting a desire to annex the 
kingdom. 
--Shi'a pilgrimages to holy sites in Iran do not indicate a 
political loyalty to Iran.  Remarks indicating that Gulf 
Shi'a are loyal to Tehran are simply aimed at stoking 
controversy between Iran and Gulf neighbors. 
--The file on the attack of the Kuwaiti diplomat in Tehran is 
now closed.  Iran-Kuwait relations are solid and Kuwait's 
stance on Iran is wise and supports the Iranian cause. 
--Iran seeks to establish close relations with the Gulf 
 
KUWAIT 00001429  002 OF 002 
 
 
States on all levels and has offered to establish a Gulf free 
trade zone. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶3.  (S) Iran fever is rising again in Kuwait, with a number 
of our contacts expressing nervousness about a possible U.S. 
attack on Iran, as they did last spring.  The GOK is walking 
a delicate line; the GOK has stated publicly that no country 
would be allowed to launch an attack on Iran from Kuwait, but 
at the same time has oriented its defense posture away from 
Iraq and towards Iran.  (Note:  Patriot Missile launchers, 
now facing Iran, can clearly be seen from Kuwaiti highways 
and the Kuwait MOD recently established an air defense 
control mission as part of an effort to defend against a 
potential Iranian attack.  End note.).  The GOK has clarified 
that it does not want WMDs in the Gulf, but rarely criticizes 
Iran directly.  Discussions among Kuwaitis about an Iran 
equipped with a nuclear weapon are more likely to highlight 
the dangers of Iran's nuclear capacity in environmental 
terms, and note that the Bushehr nuclear facility is less 
than 200 km from Kuwait's border.  End comment.
