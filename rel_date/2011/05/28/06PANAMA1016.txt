Classified By: DCM Luis Arreaga, Reasons 1.4 b and d 
 
¶1. (U) Post conveyed talking points (reftels A and B) to 
Panamanian MFA International Organizations Director Javier 
Bonagas May 25.  Bonagas was noncommittal on both subjects 
but agreed to pass on the U.S. position to FM Samuel Lewis 
Navarro. 
 
¶2. (S) Bonagas said he realized the Non-Aligned Movement 
(NAM) had lost relevance over time but that Panama would 
remain a member.  He was aware that the NAM planned to 
consider a short document on Iran at the ministerial, but 
gave no indication how Panama would vote (reftel A). 
However, Bonagas wanted to pass on the message to the USG 
that it was very difficult to ask countries like Iran for 
concessions when the asking countries had made none.  He did 
not mention the United States specifically, but asked Pol 
Officer to relate the need for &balanced concessions8 to 
the USG. 
 
¶3. (U) Bonagas did not reveal how Panama would vote on UN 
reforms, but said the NAM had put together a 70 page document 
on reform to discuss at the ministerial (reftel B). 
According to Bonagas, the document was a &radical8 and 
incohesive mix of proposals from various countries.  Bonagas 
said Panama planned to support Chile,s amendments to the 
document but did not specify what those entailed.
