------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  (C) Panama's Bank Superintendent Delia Cardenas said 
President Torrijos had asked her to resign "voluntarily," 
ostensibly so he could "restructure" GOP oversight of bank 
and financial institutions.  Cardenas also told ECON Chief on 
July 27 that this was the first time that any of the three 
Presidents under whom she had served had pressured her. 
Cardenas' departure is particularly troublesome as it comes 
as the drug prosecutor's office is in turmoil, may involve a 
nexus to on-going money laundering investigations, and is yet 
another example of Torrijos Administration's challenges to 
independent voices in the GOP.  The Ambassador has 
underscored the importance independent regulatory oversight 
of the financial sector.  End summary. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (U) As Superintendent since 1998, Cardenas has enjoyed a 
solid reputation as an independent regulator.  After the OECD 
and other international organizations blacklisted Panama's 
$45 billion bank sector for its loose controls over money 
laundering, Cardenas instituted strict "know your customer" 
requirements and other measures to repair the sector's 
credibility. 
 
¶3.  (C) Noting that "you can't fight a President who wants 
change," she said Torrijos was unhappy with her proposal to 
exit in October upon completion of her term as President of 
the Association of Supervisors of Banks of the Americas 
(ASBA).  She also declined his offer of some other GOP 
assignment, reportedly telling him, "If I'm not good enough 
for you for the Superintendency, I'm not good enough for 
another post." 
 
¶4.  (C) In giving Econoffs a heads-up on July 24, Cardenas' 
deputy, Amauri Castillo, said that Cardenas had been unable 
to get another audience with Torrijos following their May 22 
meeting and, in frustration, submitted a resignation letter 
to Torrijos on July 17, effective the following day.  He said 
Torrijos immediately phoned her to ask her to postpone it for 
one week.  Cardenas told Econ Chief that she submitted a 
second letter on July 26, effective Aug. 3.  News of her 
expected resignation hit the press July 27.  In expressing 
concern about the independence of Panamanian law enforcement 
officials at a July 27 press encounter at the Attorney 
General's office, Ambassador also regretted news of Cardenas' 
resignation, noting the importance of independent regulatory 
oversight to the financial sector. 
 
¶5.  (C) Without any prompting from Emboffs, Castillo 
speculated that powerful Panamanian bankers may be implicated 
in the Rayo Montano ("Twin Oceans") drug trafficking/money 
laundering case (Ref B).  He suggested that these bankers may 
have leaned on Torrijos to oust Cardenas and replace her with 
a more pliable appointee.  (Note: The Rayo Montano case broke 
open on May 16, virtually the same time that Torrijos first 
approached Cardenas about resigning.)

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Given the turmoil in the drug prosecutor's office 
(Ref A) and the possible nexus to money laundering by 
high-powered bankers, Cardenas' exit comes at an unfortunate 
time, particularly since Torrijos would have his chance to 
fill the job when her second (and mandatory last) five-year 
term expires in 2008.  Post will watch closely to see whether 
Torrijos' pick to replace Cardenas is an independent voice or 
merely another PRD loyalist (Ref B).  End comment
