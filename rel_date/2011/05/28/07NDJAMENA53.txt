training actually starts. 
 
¶B. Civil Military Support Elements (Chad, Mauritania, 
Nigeria, Niger, Mali, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria ($2.3 M) 
Post supports the proposal 
 
¶C. Tactical Military Intelligence Company (Chad) ($4.8M) Post 
does not support in FY 07 but would consider for FY 08 and 
upon completion of appropriate inter-agency coordination. 
 
¶D. Tactical Airlift Capacity Training (Chad) ($1.8M)  Post 
supports but will need to weigh in concerning timing. 
Postponement may be requested depending on political

¶E. Light Infantry Companies (Chad) ($4.1M)  Post supports 
proposal but requests that, in lieu of creating a third 
company, funds be used to refit and properly organize the two 
existing PSI trained companies.  Timing of implementation 
will need to be adjusted based on the political and security 
situation in Chad.
