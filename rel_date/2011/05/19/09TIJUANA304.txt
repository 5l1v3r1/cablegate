SUBJECT: EAC AMCONSULATE TIJUANA - ARREST OF SIGIFREDO NAJERA 
TALAMANTES  
¶1.    (SBU) On March 23, 2009, Post's Core Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) met to discuss potential impact relating to the 
arrest on Friday, March 20, 2009 in the Monterrey Mexico area of 
Subject, Sigifredo Najera Talamantes aka El Canicon. EAC 
participants included CONS/Acting CG, RSO, DEA, DHS-ICE, MGT, 
and ARSO/I. 
¶2.  (SBU) Post's Law Enforcement representatives informed the 
EAC members that Sigifredo Najera Talamantes aka El Canicon, was 
the Subject allegedly responsible for the Oct. 2008 attack on 
the U.S. Consulate General Monterrey, the murder of at least 
nine Mexican military officers, and several kidnappings. 
Subject was arrested Friday, March 20, in a joint DEA operation 
with GOM counterparts, along with six other defendants in the 
Monterrey area. Subject was the ZETAS plaza boss in Monterrey 
and works directly for Z-40. Subject is considered one of the 
most violent members of the ZETAS. 
¶3. (SBU) Post's EAC determined that currently, EAC members had 
no threat information regarding the U.S. Consulate General 
Tijuana, nor were repercussions anticipated in our area related 
to this arrest. At EAC recommendation, RSO notified all Post 
employees of the event and reminded all staff to remain vigilant 
and aware of their surroundings at all times, exercise extreme 
caution in their daily activities, and practice security 
protocols. 
¶6.    (SBU) Tijuana's EAC will continue to monitor the security 
situation in Tijuana.  All members will remain in close contact 
with their local U.S. and Mexican contacts regarding any new 
developments. For comments or questions, please contact RSO at 
011-52-664-622-7464, or -7451.
