CONDITIONS AND PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAELI MFA DG 
 
REF: TEL AVIV 2031 
 
Classified By: ECPO Mincouns William R. Stewart per 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) MFA Cabinet Advisor for Israeli-Palestinian Affairs 
Ahmed Hafez (please protect) briefed us September 5 on 
Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit's August 31 meeting in Cairo 
with Israeli MFA DG Aharon Abramovich.  Hafez described the 
meeting's atmosphere as ""positive,"" and stressed that the 
Egyptian side tried to maintain a positive tone in spite of 
the GOE's policy differences with the GOI on the peace 
process.  According to Hafez, Aboul Gheit raised Egyptian 
concerns over lack of progress on the ground to improve 
Palestinian living conditions on the West Bank.  Aboul Gheit 
complained about continued Israeli checkpoints and 
roadblocks, and the absence of a settlement freeze.  The 
Foreign Minister also lamented what he perceives as little 
progress from the Olmert-Abbas and Livni-Abu Ala 
negotiations.  Hafez acknowledged that Aboul Gheit did not 
repeatedly press DG Abramovich on these issues because the DG 
understands Abramovich is not a GOI decision-maker. 
 
¶2. (C) Hafez said Abramovich cautioned Aboul Gheit to have 
low expectations for a peace deal by the end of 2008, and 
asserted to the FM that accelerating negotiations would not 
be helpful.  According to Hafez, Abramovich blamed internal 
Israeli politics and an absence of Palestinian unity for the 
lack of progress in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. 
 
¶3. (C) Hafez told us that although Aboul Gheit did not agree 
with these points, he did not push back.  Hafez said the GOE 
believes that the Palestinian Authority (PA) is not to blame 
for the lack of progress in the negotiations.  The PA ""is 
doing all it can"" by continuing to meet with Olmert and Livni 
despite an absence of improvements on the ground in the West 
Bank, Hafez contended.  According to Hafez, the GOE believes 
Israel is squarely to blame for the lack of progress since 
Annapolis.  While the GOE acknowledges that PM Olmert's 
political weakness has hindered the direct negotiations with 
President Abbas, Hafez continued, the Egyptians believe the 
GOI can do much more to improve the life of Palestinians in 
the West Bank and bolster President Abbas' political 
standing.
