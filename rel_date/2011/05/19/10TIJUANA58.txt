SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION IN TIJUANA FOLLOWING ARREST OF 'EL TEO' 
 REF: TIJUANA 0035 
 
¶1.  Summary: The January 12 arrest of Teodoro Garcia Simental 
`El Teo' in La Paz, Mexico received major media coverage in Baja 
California and dominated the press in Tijuana, El Teo's 
principal area of operations.  Ambassador Pascual's statement 
congratulating the administration of Felipe Calderon was carried 
in the major media as were comments by Baja officials, 
academics, and average citizens.  The majority of articles were 
optimistic about the arrest and applauded the efforts of the 
Calderon administration, there was no significant mention of a 
USG role in the operation.   Comments from the average person 
indicate a hope that the arrest will end, or reduce, the 
violence that has terrorized Tijuana.  However, academics and 
others recognize that the fight is far from over and that the 
arrest will likely result in an increase in violence as criminal 
groups fight for control.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
¶2.  Public officials credited the efforts of President Calderon 
and close coordination of the various law enforcement entities 
for the arrest.  Governor Osuna Millan said `for the government 
of Baja California this successful operation by the federal 
government represents an important strike against organized 
crime and a clear message that we are committed in this fight.' 
He said that the Government of Baja California took preventative 
measures to respond to any violence that might result from the 
apprehension and that the capture `was the result of months of 
intelligence gathering and work by the coordination group in 
Baja California.'  Speaking of the arrest, Tijuana Mayor Jorge 
Ramos said `it remains clear that there can be times of crisis, 
but with the political will of the President of the Republic, 
the State Governor, and the Mayor, together with society, we 
have the possibility to turn back whatever force.'  He predicted 
that `it's going to be a good year for public security in 
Tijuana.' 
 
 
 
¶3.  Academics and civil society forecast more difficult times 
ahead.  Jose Ramos, a researcher at Colegio de la Frontera Norte 
(COLEF) said that while the arrest was important it could result 
in more violence as groups fight for control of `one of the most 
important drug trafficking corridors.'  He said that `Tijuana 
society is accustomed to the violence and gives the impression 
of being indifferent; the business leaders only raise their 
voice when we reach this type of situation, but the problem has 
been here for years.'  He said that the `narco' problem in the 
state will only be resolved when the state and municipal 
governments bring together all their forces and work together, 
`as the military can't do it by itself.' Anthropologist Victor 
Clark commented that `for many years we've observed the behavior 
of organized crime, including that of the Arellanos, and they 
have developed an enormous ability to reform as a group, we can 
be certain that within a couple weeks the police and the 
`underworld' will know who fills this space.' Mario Escobedo, 
President of the Tijuana Chamber of Commerce said,  `It's good 
news for commerce that they're (police) doing intelligence work, 
as long as they enforce the law the right way, [because] then 
there are voids that end up with criminals being released.' 
Roberto Quijano Sosa, leader of the Tijuana Business Owners' 
Association said  `The detention is a positive thing, and 
authorities should continue working in that same direction; 
there is still a lot of work to be done and we're far from 
feeling at ease.' 
 
 
 
¶4. One newspaper reported that the arrest lowered the tension in 
Tijuana and gave the city hope that a sense of normalcy would 
return after many years of violence.  `If he was really caught, 
then that's good news for the citizens' peace of mind, because 
organized crime, anywhere in Mexico, affects us all,' Javier 
Cordero-Employee.  `I wasn't aware, but that's good, he is an 
important criminal, violence will drop a little in Mexico, the 
municipality, but mostly in Baja,' Arturo Castellanos.  `The 
Police Dept. did a great job, I think it was time for the 
government to turn in some results,' Ricardo Rodriguez.  Police 
Chief Leyzaola was interviewed on a radio show and received a 
large number of calls to congratulate him on the arrest, though 
one caller said `I want to congratulate the DEA because they 
were the ones who took Mexican police by the hand to capture 
this creep.
