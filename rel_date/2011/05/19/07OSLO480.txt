Classified By: [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN ], Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)

¶1. (S) On May 4 we delivered reftel A points to [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN ], who reviewed the GON´s steps to freeze Sepah´s assets, as outlined in reftel B. On March 30, the GON had amended its regulations and drafted the necessary legal instruments to freeze Sepah assets in Norway. The Norwegian Security and Exchange Commission (KreditTilsynet) was contacted, which communicated the freeze to Norwegian banks and financial institutions.

¶2. (S) Sepah´s bank account in the Norwegian bank Nordea, which had a balance of approximately 28,300 USD, was immediately frozen. Nordea simultaneously deleted all credit lines with Sepah, and confirmed to the GON that there were no outstanding Sepah letters of credit. To [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN ] knowledge, there has been no evidence of an asset flight, and there is no information indicating any additional Sepah accounts in Norway.

¶3. (S) [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN ] noted that the Norwegian Central Bank provided the MFA with a copy of a letter from the Iranian Central Bank president. The letter (which was not provided to us) outlined a general Iranian appeal to European central bank governors complaining of the Security Council´s decision. The GON was asked in the letter to work toward lifting the asset freeze. The Norwegian Bank did not respond, determining that the letter should be filed "for no further action." [TEXT REMOVED BY AFTENPOSTEN ] will inform us of any additional developments.
