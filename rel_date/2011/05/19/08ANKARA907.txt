SUBJECT: TURKEY SHARES USG'S OSLO PROCESS CONCERNS 
 
REF: STATE 48124 
 
Classified By: Pol-Mil Counselor Carl Siebentritt, Reasons 1.4 (b) and 
(d) 
 
¶1. (C) We delivered reftel points to MFA Department Head for 
Disarmament and Nonproliferation Elif Ulgen on May 8.  Ulgen 
said the GOT shared USG concerns about Article 1 (b) and (c) 
of the Oslo Process draft text, and agreed with the U.S. 
position that the workarounds developed for the Ottawa 
Convention would not be an appropriate model for cluster 
munitions. 
 
¶2.  (C) Ulgen reconfirmed that the GOT will not be a 
signatory to the Oslo Process.  In addition to concerns about 
the potential impact on Alliance interoperability, Ulgen said 
the GOT had three additional concerns: 
 
-- Although the Turkish military does not use cluster 
munitions, it maintains them in its inventory as an important 
element in Turkey's national defense.  Ulgen said the Turkish 
General Staff has indicated that there are no real 
alternatives to cluster munitions for addressing Turkey's 
defense requirements. 
 
-- None of Turkey's neighbors appear to be interested in 
becoming signatories; 
 
-- Turkey is not in position to make any additional 
disarmament commitments as it is still focused on meeting its 
Ottawa Convention obligations to eliminate its stockpile of 
anti-personnel landmines. 
 
¶3.  The GOT plans to attend the May 19 Dublin meeting as an 
observer, and the delegation will be headed by the Turkish 
ambassador to Ireland, who will be supported by working level 
experts from Ulgen's office.  Ulgen stated that the GOT 
continues to view the Convention on Certain Conventional 
Weapons (CCW) as the most appropriate venue for developing a 
sensible way forward on cluster munitions that strikes a 
balance between humanitarian concerns and military 
requirements, and will intensify its engagement in the CCW. 
Ulgen confirmed that the GOT will attend the CCW's July 
experts group meeting.  Turkey also strongly supports the 
NATO tasking for the NATO Military Authorities (NMA) to 
provide military advice on the impact the Oslo Process would 
have on NATO operations, and will be very interested in NMA 
input. 
 
¶4. (C) Ulgen took on board the need to share GOT concerns 
about the Oslo Process with Allies since, if adopted, the 
current text would have an impact on overall Alliance 
interoperability, irrespective of whether individual Allies 
become signatories to the Process.
