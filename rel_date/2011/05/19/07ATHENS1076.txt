¶1. (U) On May 22, A/Polcouns delivered ref a demarche on 
cluster munitions to Counselor Dionyssios Kivetos of the MFA 
D1 Directorate for International Organizations.  As Kivetos 
indicated in past conversations on the subject (ref e), 
Greece shared the view of the United States regarding the 
issue of cluster munitions.  Indeed, Kivetos said the 
position of the Greek Ministry of Defense on the issue was 
"as close as could be with the U.S."  The GoG, like the U.S., 
believed discussions on cluster munitions should take place 
within the framework of the Convention on Conventional 
Weapons (CCW), and Greece would promote this position as 
chairman of the CCW meeting in November. 
 
¶2. (U) Given Greece's overall position on the question of 
cluster munitions, it also was not in support of the text of 
the Lima document as a basis for negotiation.  Finally, 
Kivetos noted that while Greece had not been invited to the 
Oslo meeting on cluster munitions, it had been invited to the 
Lima meeting.  Kivetos attributed this to the organizers' 
desire to invite as many countries as possible and not to 
Greece's position on cluster munitions, which was at odds 
with Norway's position.
