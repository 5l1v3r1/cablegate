SUBJECT: YESHA COUNCIL EXPANDING 
 
Classified By: Consul General Jake Walles, per reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary. The Yesha Council is expanding to include one 
representative from each settlement plus other settler 
leaders, according to Yesha Council Chairman Dani Dayan.  The 
new council will have approximately 200 delegates who will 
convene in early spring.  Dayan said the change is intended 
to make the Yesha Council more democratic, more accountable, 
and stronger.  End summary. 
 
From 17 representatives to 200 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (C) Dayan told PolOffs that each settlement, regardless 
of size, will select one individual, for the expanded Yesha 
council.  They will be joined by additional selected settler 
leaders for a total of 200.  Gush Etzion Regional Council 
Chairman Shaul Goldstein (an elected member of the current 
Yesha Council) told Poloffs October 30 that some outposts 
will also have representation.  Currently, 17 representatives 
-- some elected and some not elected -- sit on the Yesha 
Council.  Dayan said the expanded council will elect the 
chairman and leadership positions.  With an expanded board, 
Dayan said committees and sub-committees will be formed.  He 
said the full, expanded council is expected to convene in 
early spring, and he expressed confidence of his own 
re-election as Yesha Council Chairman. 
 
Accountability for violence and outposts 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C) Dayan admitted that many settlers have criticized the 
Yesha Council as an unrepresentative body because the 
leadership is mostly appointed, not elected. Dayan said 
expansion will make the council more democratic and unified, 
and he believes it will strengthen the Council.  He said 
direct representation will make settler leaders more 
accountable for incidents of violence and illegal outpost 
activity.  He acknowledged that settler violence has been 
higher than usual in recent months.  He characterized it as 
an ""image problem"" that has ""stained our PR efforts,"" but 
said there have also been increased Palestinian provocations. 
 
""Endless talking"" 
----------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Goldstein expressed doubt that the larger body would 
be more effective, saying it will only result in ""endless 
talking.""  He said the restructuring was meant to have 
happened two years ago in the wake of the Gaza evacuation, 
but never materialized.
