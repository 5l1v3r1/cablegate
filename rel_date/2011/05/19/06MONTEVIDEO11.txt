Classified By: Charge D'Affaires, a.i. Linda T. Gonzalez 
for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Economy and Finance Minister Danilo 
Astori's openly advocated negotiating Free Trade Agreements 
(FTA) with the US and China this year, according to a 
recently published interview.  He also said that Uruguay's 
left had matured and that it realized that investment meant 
jobs, and he held out Chile as the regional model to emulate. 
 Astori's remarks reflect GOU pragmatism and confidence and 
help to point the way forward (ref B) in our bilateral 
relationship with the EP/FA government. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Below are selected excerpts from Minister Astoris' 
end-of-the-year interview published in the January 5, 2006 
edition of the weekly ""Busqueda."" 
 
-- Back page headline: ""Uruguay Will Negotiate 'Free Trade 
Agreements' with the U.S. and China to 'Give People Jobs'"" 
 
-- Subtitle: ""Astori says that the left ""is learning,"" that 
the Executive branch has initiated a 'modernization' process	 
and 'if you ask me who I feel closest to on these issues, to 	
reason them out and to adopt government policies, I would say 	
without a doubt it would be Chile."" 	
 	
-- (FTAs) ""Are the path to achieving the most important 	
objective of the Uruguayan left -- job creation."" 	
 	
-- Uruguay has the image of a country that is serious, 	
responsible and one that keeps its promises -- that is very 	
important."" 	
 	
-- In response to the question, is the idea to negotiate an 	
FTA with the US in 2006? ""Yes, of course. The sooner the 	
better."" 	
 	
-- In choosing to adopt a regional economic model, Astori 
clearly decided in favor of Chile's model and noted his 
differences"" with the Argentine one. ""I identify much more 
with the way in which the Government of Chile focuses on 
priorities, utilizes its instruments and even its attitude 
towards facing problems. I also share its vision of the 
future and its vision about the role of government and its 
relations with society and the private sector."" 
 
#¿NOMBRE?
left might make things difficult in concluding a FTA with the 
US: ""...but we are talking about our main commercial partner. 
We are paying high import duties on meat that we are selling 
in the US at very attractive prices. does it hurt us or 
benefit us if we don't have to pay the tariffs by signing an 
FTA?"" 
 
-- ""We also want to negotiate an FTA with China to establish 
a more fluid relationship with that country."" 
 
Comment: 
-------- 
¶3. (C) Astori's comments are another indication that the GOU 
is confident it can continue to pursue orthodox macroeconomic 
policies and independence in the face of radicals in its 
EP/FA coalition and with its problematic Mercosur partners. 
Judging from President Vazquez' adroit handling of the 
Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) he probably can achieve an 
FTA if all other conditions are met. We note, however, that 
the radicals have not gone away and that some sectors have 
been considerably strengthened by the recent passage of the 
Labor Protection and Promotion"" law (ref A).  End Comment.
