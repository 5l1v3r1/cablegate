THE TABLE 
 
¶1.  This message contains an action message for the 
Department -- please see para 6. 
 
¶2.  Embassy meetings with GOL and agrifood industry leaders 
have confirmed that current stocks of wheat in Lebanon are at 
a critically low level.  President of Dora Flour Mills and 
Chair of the Agrifood Traders Syndicate Arslan Sinno told 
emboffs that perhaps only a 10-15 day reserve supply of wheat 
remains in Lebanon.  Sinno added that commercial mills have 
been taking steps to stretch remaining grain stocks by 
rationing their output, closing for portions of the day, and 
only partially filling orders from industrial bakers.  Sinno 
explained that the milling/flour industry in Lebanon is very 
much dependent on maintaining stocks of wheat to be milled on 
demand.  Lebanon's climate and the high overhead cost of 
maintaining storage facilities preclude most consumers from 
storing large quantities of flour. 
 
¶3.  Sinno and other mill owners confirm that they currently 
have no means of getting stocks of wheat delivered to 
Lebanon.  Normally, Lebanese millers import wheat from Russia 
using small capacity ships, holding less than 10,000 tons. 
The millers prefer Russian wheat as it trades at 
approximately 165 USD per ton CNF (including freight costs), 
while U.S. wheat costs over $240 per ton including freight. 
Orders placed prior to July 12, 2006 that were inbound to 
Lebanon have had to be canceled or resold on the market, 
often at a loss to the miller in Lebanon.  Ship owners 
operating grain transports have refused to cross the sea 
blockade to port in Lebanon.  Several mill owners report 
frustrating and unusual demands from their shippers, 
including one ship owner requesting a letter signed by 
President Bush and Prime Minister Olmert of Israel 
guaranteeing the ship's safety.  Sinno stressed the urgency 
of getting a shipment of grain en route to Lebanon, as 
turn-around times for U.S.-originating grain shipments 
average 30 days. 
 
¶4.  The Agrifood Syndicate has approached the GOL and the US 
Embassy with a proposal asking for help to alleviate the 
wheat shortage.  In a letter to Lebanese PM Siniora and 
Minister of the Economy Sami Haddad, the syndicate proposes 
that the GOL request from the USG a humanitarian shipment of 
wheat. The transit and delivery of the shipment would be 
guaranteed by the USG, who could make the proper assurances 
to the IDF to allow the shipment to cross the blockade.  The 
30,000-ton shipment (approximately 6 million USD in value), 
enough for approximately 1 month of normal flour consumption 
in Lebanon, would then be sold to Lebanese commercial 
millers.  If the wheat were sold at a ""replacement rate"" 
(i.e. the previously negotiated rate for Russian wheat), 
bread and flour prices would remain more or less constant in 
Lebanon.  The Syndicate has also approached the Embassy of 
France with a similar proposal, but Sinno and others prefer 
U.S. wheat as ""more suitable"" for Lebanese flour products. 
Proceeds from the sale could then be used by the GOL for 
reconstruction or humanitarian concerns. 
 
¶5.  Previously, Lebanon has benefited from USAID/USDA 
humanitarian wheat programs, such as ""Food for Education."" 
In the most recent wheat shipment, the International Orthodox 
Christian Charities (IOCC) NGO received 50,000 tons of wheat, 
which was then sold at auction to local Lebanese mills.  The 
IOCC used the proceeds to support its local education 
initiatives.  There is no current PL-480 program for Lebanon, 
as its per-capita income is too high.  Under current USDA and 
USAID rules, request for a similar grain shipment would need 
to originate from a U.S.-based NGO and be coupled with 
Embassy Beirut's endorsement. 
 
¶6.  ACTION REQUEST:  Based on suggestions from the agrifood 
sector and the GOL on grain shipments, post recommends that 
the Department engage with USDA and USAID to: 
 
--Investigate the possibility of donating 25,000 to 30,000 
tons of ""#2 U.S. Hard Red Winter Wheat"" to the GOL for 
re-sale and distribution as described above. 
 
--Arrange for shipment of the wheat by U.S.-flag transport 
vessels 
 
--Liaise with the Government of Israel to clear the shipment 
through the sea blockade 
 
¶7.  Comment:  Maintaining bread and flour proces at current 
 
BEIRUT 00002652  002 OF 002 
 
 
levels and insuring the supply of wheat in the short-run will 
alleviate domestic economic pressure on the Siniora 
government.  The visibility of USG efforts to stave off a 
potentially crippling crisis of a bread and flour shortage 
would go far to demonstrate USG support for the GOL and the 
Lebanese people.  While there are several NGOs who could 
handle such an operation under normal circumstances (Mercy 
Corps, IOCC, World Vision, YMCA), most of their operations 
have turned to meeting the immediate humanitarian needs of 
Lebanon's inernally displaced persons (IDPs).  Allowing the 
GOL to be the receiver of such a shipment would secure 
immediate and efficient distribution of the grain upon 
arrival and bolster the private sector's confidence in the 
GOL. 
 
¶8.  Comment continued:  Given the time needed to get a ship 
of wheat loaded and to Lebanon, we hope that this request can 
be approved and acted upon as promptly as possible.  As in 
fuel, wheat shortages are likely to benefit Syrian 
blackmarketeers while hurting the average Lebanese consumer 
-- and damaging the credibility of the Siniora government. 
We should not underestimate the impact, political and 
otherwise, bread shortages and/or hikes in bread prices would 
have, especially during this critical period.  End Comment.
