Fact Sheet: Designation of Iranian Entities and
Individuals for Proliferation Activities. July 8, 2008.

The U.S. Government is taking actions today to further
U.S. efforts to counter Iran's pursuit of technology
that could enable it to develop nuclear weapons and the
missiles capable of delivering them. Today, the
Departments of State and Treasury designated under
Executive Order 13382 six Iranian individuals and five
entities of proliferation concern. These actions
provide additional information that will help financial
institutions in the United States and worldwide protect
themselves from deceptive financial practices employed
by Iranian entities and individuals engaged in or
supporting proliferation.

All UN Member States are required to freeze the assets
of entities and individuals listed in the Annexes of UN
Security Council resolutions 1737, 1747 and 1803, as
well as assets of entities owned or controlled by them,
and to prevent funds or economic resources from being
made available to them.

Effect of Today's Actions

As a result of our actions today, all transactions
involving any of the designees and any U.S. person will
be prohibited and any assets the designees may have
under U.S. jurisdiction will be frozen. Noting the UN
Security Council's grave concern over Iran's nuclear and
ballistic missile program activities, the United States
also encourages all jurisdictions to take similar
actions to ensure full and effective implementation of
UN Security Council Resolutions 1737, 1747, and 1803.

E.O. 13382, signed by the President on June 28, 2005, is

financial and commercial systems. Designations under
the Order prohibit all transactions between the
designees and any U.S. person, and freeze any assets the
designees may have under U.S. jurisdiction.
