Classified By: DCM Mary Ellen T. Gilroy for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (U) On November 3, Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member 
states unanimously supported the compromise nomination of 
Panama as the candidate to the United Nations Security 
Council from the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States 
(GRULAC).  However, Ambassadors to the UN from CARICOM 
countries were not pleased with the handling of the 
compromise. 
 
¶2. (C) Crispin Gregoire, Ambassador of Dominica to the UN, 
told PolOff in telcon that CARICOM countries were not opposed 
to the consensus but were disappointed that the press learned 
of the Panama compromise before GRULAC members did. 
According to Ambassador Gregoire, the delegation from 
Ecuador, which chaired the compromise between Guatemala and 
Venezuela, went straight to the media after brokering the 
agreement to nominate Panama.  Ambassador Gregoire said that 
he and his CARICOM colleagues first learned of the compromise 
through the British Broadcasting Corporation and Reuters. 
When CARICOM Ambassadors complained, they were told that 
GRULAC members received a fax announcing the decision; the 
Dominican mission had no record of having received such a fax. 
 
¶3. (U) At a GRULAC meeting on November 2, CARICOM Ambassadors 
stated that they could not endorse the Panama compromise 
until they consulted with their capitals.  On the afternoon 
of November 3, CARICOM informed GRULAC that they supported 
the decision. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Judging from the November 6 telcon, it appears 
November 3 and 5 press on this issue was largely accurate, 
with a few minor errors.  As of November 5, the Barbados Sun 
stated that the Caribbean nations' asking for more time 
"effectively forc(ed) a postponement of the decision by the 
(GRULAC)."  However, in a November 3 article, the Caribbean 
Media Corporation (CMC) correctly stated that "a formal reply 
on the matter, after ratification by regional capitals, could 
be made as early as Friday." 
 
¶5. (U) The CMC quoted Dr. Denzil Douglas, Prime Minister of 
St. Kitts and Nevis and current CARICOM Chairman, as saying, 
"The UN vote will be among matters to be discussed at a 
CARICOM Bureau meeting in Barbados over the weekend." 
Contacts in the Foreign Ministries of Barbados, St. Kitts and 
Nevis and St. Vincent and the Grenadines told PolOff this 
meeting was tentatively scheduled but postponed.  Bureau 
meetings tend to convene biannually, and the last CARICOM 
Bureau meeting was October 17, 2006.  The CARICOM Bureau is a 
quorum of the current, previous, and upcoming CARICOM 
chairpersons.  The current Bureau consists of Prime Ministers 
Denzil Douglas of St. Kitts and Nevis, Patrick Manning of 
Trinidad and Tobago, and Ralph Gonsalves of St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines.
