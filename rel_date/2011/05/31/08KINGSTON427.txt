1.(C)  Spanish President of Government Rodriguez Zapatero 
thus far has refused to schedule a meeting with Jamaican 
Prime Minister (PM) Bruce Golding during the latter's 
upcoming visit to Madrid, according to Spain's Ambassador in 
Kingston, Jesus Silva.  Speaking privately with Ambassador at 
a reception the evening of May 13, Silva expressed his 
government's extreme frustration with Golding's closure of 
RIU Group's massive hotel construction site in Montego Bay 
because of its alleged breach of the law in constructing a 
fourth floor for which it had not obtained the required 
permit.  The State Minister in the Office of the PM, Daryl 
Vaz, a close advisor to Golding, sought to assuage Silva's 
concerns, and reportedly is meeting May 14 with RIU Group 
representatives at the Spanish Embassy.  According to the 
"Gleaner" newspaper of May 14, "at least one Spanish investor 
has put on hold plans to construct a hotel, and two others 
have diverted attention from Jamaica, as the Spaniards take a 
wait-and-see attitude to the country's investment climate." 
 
 
Background: the Spanish "Re-Conquest" of Jamaica 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2.(SBU)  The Spanish RIU Group operates three large hotels on 
Jamaica's north coast and has another two under construction. 
 Since 2002, RIU and five other powerful Spanish groups have 
started construction of twenty large hotels, comprising 
almost 10,000 rooms, with overall Spanish investment 
surpassing USD 1.5 billion -- thus unseating the U.S. as 
Jamaica's largest source of foreign direct investment. 
However, as delineated reftels, this massive investment has 
brought environmental, infrastructure, labor, and regulatory 
difficulties in its wake.  Over the last year, several 
Spanish firms have faced various allegations of unsafe and/or 
substandard working conditions, harsh treatment of workers, 
and violations of building codes.
