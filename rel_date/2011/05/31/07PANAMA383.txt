SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) Noting that Cuba "has demonstrated its solidarity and 
support" for Panama since "the epoch of General Omar 
Torrijos," Panamanian First VP and FM Samuel Lewis launched 
the first meeting of the Panama-Cuba binational commission on 
March 2.  Lewis added that the meeting was "of high 
importance" and would result in "productive discussions for 
both countries."  In his February 27 breakfast with 
Ambassador, Lewis downplayed Cuban FM Felipe Perez Roque's 
visit, neglecting to note that it would be the inaugural 
session of a new binational commission process.  "Today, the 
full normalization of relations and the respectful exchange 
of dialogue was sealed," Perez Roque said.  Perez Roque and 
Lewis inaugurated an ophthamological surgery clinic and 
signed four bilateral agreements.  End summary.

Binational Commission Launched 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) Lewis and Perez Roque launched the First Panama-Cuba 
Meeting of Mechanisms of Political Consultation and Mixed 
Meetings on Cooperation on March 2.  Perez Roque explained 
that this commission would meet yearly, alternating between 
Panama and Cuba, and "would facilitate an institutional 
dialogue that was broader and more orderly between Foreign 
Ministries."  Perez Roque characterized the launch of this 
binational process as the culmination of process that 
resulted in the "full normalization" of relations with Panama.

Operation Miracle Goes Local 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The two FMs inaugurated an ophthamological surgery 
center at the Chicho Fabrega hospital in Panama's Santiago 
province to conduct eye surgeries.  This clinic's opening 
enables Cuba's Operation Miracle to put down roots in Panama 
and means that prospective needy patients will no longer need 
to travel to Cuba.  Perez Roque asserted that this clinic 
would have the latest equipment and enable Cuban and 
Panamanian doctors to collaborate. 
 
---------------------- 
Four Agreements Signed 
---------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The two FMs signed four agreements:  (a) a convention 
on mutual legal assistance, (b) a treaty on the transfer of 
sentenced persons, (c) an agreement to cooperation on the 
exchange of information and technical assistance related to 
the preservation of historical diplomatic documents and 
files, and (d) a bilateral instrument for the mutual 
recognition of courses of study, titles, and diplomas of 
higher education.  Lewis noted, "We have been able to 
identify other collaboration agreements where in the future 
we are going to be able to deepen our relationship, for 
example, in the commercial area.  A Cuban-Panamanian Chamber 
of Commerce may be established and perhaps at the next Havana 
Fair there will be a well-established pavilion for Panama.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶5. (C) The launch of this Panama-Cuba binational commission 
is but another example of President Torrijos' policy of 
striving to maintain cordial relations with all its 
hemispheric neighbors, including Cuba.  The opening of an eye 
surgery clinic in Panama will help mute criticism that 
Operation Miracle needlessly and inefficiently required 
patients to travel to Cuba.  Aside from the clinic, the 
substance of this meeting was thin.  Symbolically though, the 
launch of this binational commission enables Cuba to tout the 
"full normalization" of relations with Panama as an example 
that Cuba continues to conduct business as usual.
