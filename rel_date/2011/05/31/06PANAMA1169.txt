Chavez comes to town
---------------------------

¶1.  (C) At the invitation of the GOP, Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez will visit Panama on June 22 for a one-day stop
to celebrate the 180th anniversary of Simon Bolivar's
Anfitionic Congress in Panama when Simon Bolivar called on
individual Latin American countries band together into a
hemispheric union.  Given the nature of the visit, Embassy
expects Chavez to use inflammatory rhetoric against the
United States in an attempt to provoke us and drive a wedge
between the U.S. and Panama.  President Torrijos told the
Ambassador (reftel) that Chavez's visit and endorsement of
the Canal expansion would neutralize leftist groups opposed
to the project.  Torrijos also predicted however that the
visit could get "ugly."

-----------------------
Embassy Engagement Plan
-----------------------

¶2.  (C) Embassy is preparing for the visit on two fronts:
political and public diplomacy. On the political front, we
are reaching out to prominent political figures and political
commentators to ask for their views on Chavez.  We will use
the discussion to weave in Washington-provided talking points
about Chavez's track record on democracy, multilateral
diplomacy, meddling in other country affairs (Bolivia and
Peru), and energy initiatives.   We intend to approach
opposition political leaders, leading political commentators,
and with business leaders.  We will be careful to put the
spotlight on Chavez only and avoid direct or implied
criticism of Panama's decision to invite him.

¶3.  (U) On the public diplomacy front, our discussions with
journalists and editors will raise similar concerns.  We will
also attempt to place for publication recent op-eds from the
Wall Street Journal and Washington Post expressing concern
about Chavez's intentions.  Internally, we will distribute
within the mission talking points related to previous Chavez
claims but will not speak publicly about the visit until we
hear what Chavez has to say.  The GOP promises to keep him in
check but we doubt their ability to control him once he takes
the microphone in any public fora.

-------------------------------------------
Suggested press guidance for the Department
-------------------------------------------

¶4.  (SBU) We suggest the following talking points for
responding to questions about the visit:

-- Panama is free to pursue its relations with other
countries in accordance with its views of its national
interest.

-- President Chavez has declared many times his opposition to
the kinds of free trade agreements that have brought economic
benefits to countries like Chile, Singapore, Mexico, the
United States, and many others.

-- The United States remains concerned about Chavez's
commitment to democratic governance and his meddling in the
internal political processes of neighboring states.

-- Chavez is a potentially destabilizing force in the region,
especially in view of his increased arms purchases.
