REF: STATE 89994 
 
Â¶1. (C) The GOP was unlikely to reconsider its previous 
decision to not accept Chinese Uighur detainees currently 
being held in Guantanamo, Panamanaian MFA Sub-Director for 
Political Affairs Vladimir Franco told POLOFFs on July 10 in 
response to delivery of reftel demarche.  Franco asked for 
clarification on the meaning of "receiving" these refugees 
and asserted that the 1951 Convention on Refugees stated that 
refugees should be placed in a community that was similar to 
their own interests and identity.  Franco voiced concern on 
Panama's ability to integrate these detainees into Panamanian 
society, since there was no community in which to place them. 
 He undertook to brief his superiors on the demarche.
