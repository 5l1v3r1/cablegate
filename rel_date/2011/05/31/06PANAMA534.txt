Classified By: Ambassador William A. Eaton - Reasons 1.5(b and d) 
 
 ¶1.  (C) Panamanian First Vice President/Foreign Minister 
Samuel Lewis Navarro (SLN) told Ambassador on March 23 that 
he met for the first time with Fidel Castro in Cuba over the 
March 18-19 weekend.  He said Castro appeared to be in good 
health, as he turned what SLN expected to be a 15-minute 
"protocol visit" into a 5-plus hour marathon discussion 
focused on energy issues.  After SLN commented on some of the 
GOP's challenges in coping with growing energy demands and 
rising fuel prices, Castro replied at length on Cuba's 
efforts to do likewise.  Suggesting that Castro appeared 
"obsessed" with energy efficiency and alternative 
technologies, SLN said Castro expects Cuba will save $1 
billion a year on imported oil simply by replacing 
traditional light bulbs with more efficient florescent bulbs. 
 
¶2.  (C) SLN added that Castro avoided his usual rhetoric and 
came across as pragmatic.  He said that Castro told him that, 
forty years ago, he disdained the economic advice of the 
"Chicago boys," but that the "Moscow boys" who came later 
were even worse.  Castro told SLN that, although he would 
never say so publicly, he considers himself a "socialistic 
neoliberal" and counseled the GOP to "stay on track" with the 
U.S.  SLN said Castro basically dismissed Hugo Chavez as too 
extreme with his criticism of the U.S.
