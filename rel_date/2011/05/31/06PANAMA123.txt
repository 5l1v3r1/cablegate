¶1.  (C)  On January 17, Ambassador Eaton delivered reftel
demarche to Foreign Minister Samuel Lewis and discussed the
GOP's position on a possible emergency IAEA Board meeting to
report Iran to UNSC.  Ambassador Eaton emphasized to Lewis
that Iran has violated both IAEA resolutions and EU-3
agreements and is proceeding with uranium enrichment
activities.  Ambassador Eaton also told Lewis that the U.S.
and other countries believe Iran's development of a uranium
enrichment technology exists for purposes of developing
nuclear weapons.  Lewis told Ambassador Eaton that the
Government of Panama also is concerned about Iran's actions
and pledged Panama's support to the U.S. on this issue.

¶2.  (C)  Separately, on January 17, POL Counselor met with
Vice Foreign Minister Ricardo Duran.  Duran said that the
Iranian Ambassador to Panama, who resides in Colombia,
recently traveled to Panama to ask Duran for Panama's support
at the IAEA for Iran's right to develop uranium enrichment
technology for peaceful purposes.  Duran said he stated that
the Foreign Ministry would give the Iranian Ambassador's
request every due consideration.  When the Iranian Ambassador
left, Duran said he telephoned the Panamanian Ambassador to
the IAEA in Vienna and instructed him to "vote with the
Americans on this issue."
