Panama working through SICA 
--------------------------- 
 
¶1. (C) "We are working with the Central American Integration 
System (SICA) to see if we pull together several of our 
neighbors to join Panama in recognizing Kosovo," First VP and 
FM Samuel Lewis told Ambassador March 26 in response to 
reftel demarche. "Panama has no problem recognizing Kosovo, 
but we could not do so while Panama still held the presidency 
of the UN Security Council," Lewis added.  While it would not 
be possible to get all SICA members to agree to recognize, 
Lewis said he believed that Panama could bring most SICA 
members along.  (Note:  The following countries are SICA 
members:  Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.  The Dominican Republic is 
an associated state.  Spain, Mexico, and Taiwan are 
observers.)  Lewis said, "I will work this issue myself."

Spanish Diplomacy Against Recognition 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) Lewis asserted that Spanish diplomacy had been 
effective in dissuading Latin American countries from 
recognizing Kosovo.  "The Spanish argue:  what do you get out 
of recognizing Kosovo?  That's an effective message for 
countries with close ties to Spain when Kosovo is half-way 
around the world," Lewis explained.  Lewis said Spanish 
diplomacy on this matter was driven out of concern for its 
own Basque and Catalan separatist challenges.

Comment

¶3.  (C) Panama has been stalling since February 16 when Lewis 
told Ambassador it would recognize Kosovo "soon, but after 
the Europeans."  Reftel statistics noting that three-fourths 
of the EU, half of Serbia's and Kosovo's neighbors, all G-7 
members and that the pace of recognition had been faster than 
for Bangladesh, Croatia, Macedonia, Eritrea or East Timor had 
a significant impact.  Given Panama's reluctance to date to 
blaze a path forward on Kosovo recognition, it remains to be 
seen whether Lewis will indeed carry out effective diplomatic 
efforts to bring along multiple Central American countries 
(and possible the Domincan Republic) to recognize Kosovo.
