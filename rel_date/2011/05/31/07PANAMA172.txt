GOP "INSISTS" ON OLD NOTE 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) The Panamanian MFA has not completed its legal 
analysis of the new U.S. diplomatic note language requesting 
status of forces protections (REFTEL A) and does not 
anticipate being able to present its counterproposal for 
several days, MFA DG for Legal Matters and Treaties Iana 
Quadri told POLCHIEF on February 2.  Under instructions, 
Quadri said that, in the interest of to avoiding canceling 
the upcoming NEW HORIZONS exercise, the GOP "insists" on 
reverting to the "old diplomatic note" to enable this 
exercise to take place as planned.  She stated that the MFA 
would continue its analysis of the new diplomatic note 
language, with a special emphasis on dealing with the 
contractor issue, and underscored that the GOP was committed 
to presenting the USG a counterproposal.  Quadri said that 
the GOP wished to revert to the old diplomatic note language 
solely for the upcoming NEW HORIZONS exercise. 
 
¶3.  (C) Preparations are already underway for NEW HORIZONS, 
scheduled to begin in earnest on/about February 12.  NEW 
HORIZONS is scheduled to begin only a couple of days before 
Panamanian President Torrijos meets with SECDEF and POTUS on 
February 16 in Washington.  Additionally, in support of 
post's Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) office and Tactical 
Analysis Team (TAT), JTF-B is scheduled to deploy helicopter 
assets to Panama on February 21 as part of operation ALL 
INCLUSIVE, a multi-lateral counternarcotics interdiction 
operation.  ALL INCLUSIVE will involve ground, sea, and air 
forces from the U.S., Panama, and other countries.

ACTION REQUEST

participate in NEW HORIZONS.
