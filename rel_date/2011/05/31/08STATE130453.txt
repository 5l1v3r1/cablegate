SUBJECT: AGREEMENT WITH NICARAGUA ON STATUS OF FORCES FOR 
EXERCISES IN NICARAGUA DURING 2009 
 
REF: A. MANAGUA 001109 
     ¶B. STATE 002677 
 
Classified By: WHA A/S Thomas A. Shannon for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST. SEE PARAGRAPHS 2, 5 AND 6. 
 
¶2. (C) ON AUGUST 8, 2008, AMEMBASSY MANAGUA AND THE 
GOVERNMENT ON NICARAGUA (GON) COMPLETED AN EXCHANGE OF 
DIPLOMATIC NOTES REGARDING A STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT 
(SOFA) AND CUSTOMS PROCEDURES FOR U.S. FORCES IN NICARAGUA 
FOR EXERCISES, VISITS, AND OTHER COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES 
DURING 2008.  AS DISCUSSED IN REF A, WASHINGTON CONTINUES TO 
BELIEVE IN THE NEED TO PURSUE A DURABLE SOFA WITH THE GON. 
AT AN INTERAGENCY MEETING ON OCTOBER 15, 2008, IT WAS AGREED 
THAT THE USG WOULD SEEK A MULTIPLE YEAR SOFA WITH THE GON. 
HOWEVER, THE INTERAGENCY IS STILL DEVELOPING A STRATEGY FOR 
APPROACHING THE GON ON THIS SUBJECT, AND AT PRESENT WE HAVE 
SEEN NO INDICATIONS THAT SUCH AN AGREEMENT CAN BE ATTAINED IN 
THE SHORT TERM.  IN THE INTERIM, AGENCIES HAVE AGREED TO 
PROCEED WITH A SIMPLE ROLL-OVER OF THE EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS. 
 BASED ON DOD'S REQUEST, POST IS REQUESTED TO PRESENT THE 
NOTES IN PARAGRAPHS 3 AND 4 TO THE GON REGARDING A SOFA 
AGREEMENT AND CUSTOMS PROCEDURES FOR DOD OPERATIONAL 
ACTIVITIES IN 2009, STRESSING THAT THE N 
OTES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE NOTES EXCHANGED ON 
AUGUST 8, 2008, EXCEPT TO REFLECT FUTURE ACTIVITIES AND DATES. 
 
¶3. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF DIPLOMATIC NOTE ON SOFA:

OF APRIL 18, 1961; THAT UNITED STATES PERSONNEL BE PERMITTED 
TO ENTER AND EXIT NICARAGUA WITH UNITED STATES IDENTIFICATION

INTO OR ACQUIRED IN NICARAGUA BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED 
STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2009 
OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES SHALL REMAIN WITH THE UNITED STATES 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, WHICH MAY REMOVE SUCH PROPERTY FROM 
NICARAGUA AT ANY TIME, FREE FROM EXPORT DUTIES, TAXES, AND 
OTHER CHARGES.  THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED IN THIS PARAGRAPH 
SHALL ALSO EXTEND TO ANY DUTY, TAX, OR OTHER CHARGE THAT IS 
ASSESSED UPON SUCH PROPERTY AFTER IMPORTATION INTO OR

PERSONS OR ENTITIES.

AWARD CONTRACTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ARTICLES AND SERVICES 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED STATES LAW AND REGULATIONS.  THE 
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
CHOOSE SUCH CONTRACTORS, AND SUCH CONTRACTORS AND THEIR 
EMPLOYEES WHO ARE FOREIGNERS OR NON-NATIONALS OF NICARAGUA 
SHALL BE ACCORDED THE SAME PRIVILEGES AS UNITED STATES 
PERSONNEL WITH REGARD TO LICENSING AND REGISTRATION OF 
VEHICLES, DRIVERS, AND PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL; AND WITH 
REGARD TO THE EXPORT, IMPORT, AND ACQUISITION OF GOODS AND 
EQUIPMENT FOR OFFICIAL OR PERSONAL USE. 
 
     THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND UNITED STATES 
PERSONNEL MAY USE WATER, ELECTRICITY, AND OTHER PUBLIC 
SERVICES AND FACILITIES, FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF 
NICARAGUA WILL ASSIST THE UNITED STATES AUTHORITIES IN TAKING 
MEASURES TO OBTAIN SUCH SERVICES FROM THE INSTITUTIONS AND 
CORRESPONDING OFFICES, FOR THE APPROPRIATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
AFOREMENTIONED 2009 OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 
 
     FINALLY, ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AS MAY BE NECESSARY MAY
