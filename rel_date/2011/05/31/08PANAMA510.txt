Panama Supports UNSC Engagement on Zimbabwe 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (C) "Panama fully supports (UK PM) Gordon Brown's recent 
statement regarding the violence in Zimbabwe," Panamanian MFA 
UNSC Advisor Janio Tunon told POL Fellow on June 23.  Now 
that the opposition had pulled out of the upcoming elections, 
MFA UNSC Team ExecSec Thays Noriega told POLCOUNS that it was 
even more important for the UNSC to take action so that 
Mugabe "could not be rewarded for collapsing the opposition." 
 Panama supported a PRST on Zimbabwe, both Tunon and Noriega 
said, but was interested in hearing what South Africa would 
have to say in private before the June 23 public meeting. 
Panama intended to make a national statement as well, both 
confirmed.  Noting that the Human Rights Council was in no 
position to deal effectively with the growing conflict in 
Zimbabwe, Noriega said that it was all the more critical that 
the UNSC act.  Noriega said Panama would support making 
Zimbabwe an agenda item for the Council.

Comment

¶2.  (C) Noriega is the youngest daughter of former Panamanian 
dictator Manuel Antoinio Noriega, currently under preventive 
detention in Florida pending resolution of a French 
extradition request.  In this case, the daughter's 
condemnation of Mugabe's tactics against Zimbabwe's 
opposition -- tactics her own father might have used -- was 
particularly striking.  Her off the cuff remark that the HRC 
could not be expected to respond effectively as the UNSC 
might was also particularly revealing.
