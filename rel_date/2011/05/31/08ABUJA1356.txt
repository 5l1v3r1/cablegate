Classified By: Political Counselor Walter Pflaumer for reasons 1.4. (b 
& d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  Ambassador met with Nigerian Foreign 
Minister Ojo Maduekwe on July 11 to demarche on Zimbabwe 
(Refs A and B).  She also took the occasion to execute 
requested demarche on the Niger Delta, and address U.S. 
concerns over recent redeployments at the Economic and 
Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) (Refs C and D).  FonMin 
noted that Niger Delta Summit and Gambari's role were badly 
handled, said that GON is looking for an international role 
on oil bunkering like the Kimberley diamond process, 
highlighting that a "name and shame" program would decrease 
demand for bunkered oil.  The Ambassador pointed out our 
reservations on the effectiveness of a process like this and 
noted the electronic bill of lading idea.  The Ambassador 
told FonMin that we are watching the recent EFCC 
redeployments closely to judge any negative impact on the 
institution's capacity, and that we want the EFCC to continue 
to move in the direction of increased transparency and 
improved efficiency.  FonMin said he would raise these 
concerns with EFCC Chairwoman Waziri during a courtesy call 
she has requested.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Taking advantage of a July 11 meeting to present a 
demarche on Zimbabwe (Refs A and B), the Ambassador also 
delivered a requested demarche on the Niger Delta (Ref C). 
FonMin was accompanied by Senior Special Assistant to the 
President on Foreign Affairs Amb. Thaddeus Hart, Director of 
the Office of the Honorable Minister of Foreign Affairs 
(OHMFA) Emmanuel Ogunnaike, and Deputy Director of OHMFA Sola 
Enikanolaiye.  Ambassador was accompanied by PolDeputy 
(notetaker). 
 
DELTA: GON PLANS, USG ASSISTANCE 
-------------------------------- 

¶3. (C) Ambassador noted recent reports that the much-touted 
Niger Delta Summit (a cornerstone of the GON Delta policy) 
may be delayed yet again by the removal of UN envoy Ibrahim 
Gambari as chairman of the Niger Delta Summit Steering 
Committee (Ref E).  Ambassador voiced concern that the 
process will be further slowed or, worse yet, stalled.  While 
we understood Nigeria's concerns to protect its own sovereign 
rights, we urged the GON to change its thinking on the Delta 
to include the international ramifications of its actions (or 
inactions). 
 
¶4. (C) The Ambassador noted that several offers of USG 
assistance, some under the Gulf of Guinea Energy Security 
Strategy (GGESS) process, had remained unanswered -- some for 
up to a year.  The Ambassador outlined the types of 
assistance we have offered, including stockpile security 
management, weapons tracing, aerial surveillance of petroleum 
platforms, and training/equipment programs, some of which 
would be fully-funded USG assistance and others of which 
could be done on a reimbursable basis.  FonMin asked for 
details on unanswered offers of assistance; Ambassador agreed 
to send more information.  (Note: Ambassador sent an Aide 
Memoire later that afternoon outlining USG offers.)  FonMin 
also asked Senior Special Assistant to the President on 
Foreign Affairs Hart to check with the Ministry of Defense to 
see what is holding up responses on these USG offers. 
 
¶5. (C) The Ambassador asked for clarification of recent 
public statements from President Yar'Adua referencing a 
proposal to reduce oil bunkering, and also what the 
President's vision was on addressing this issue.  FonMin said 
the GON is looking into a process similar to the Kimberley 
diamond process.  Such a "name and shame" program could 
significantly reduce bunkering by reducing demand, he argued. 
 The Ambassador encouraged the GON to look as well at 
international oil companies' proposal for electronic bills of 
lading, which could be used to verify the origin of 
petroleum, and added that the USG had its doubts about any 
Kimberley-like process on oil. 
 
EFCC: NEW CHAIRWOMAN, NEW STAFF 
------------------------------- 

¶6. (C) The Ambassador noted USG and broader international 
concern that the recent redeployment of EFCC staff could 
seriously affect the institution's capacity to fight 
corruption (Refs C and D).  She noted that some of the 
individuals redeployed had received donor-sponsored 
(including USG) training and that with these mass 
redeployments, some of the capacity built up over years at 
the EFCC would be lost.  FonMin said he understood USG 
concern.  He confided that EFCC Chairwoman Waziri had 
inheirited some staff with prejudices and questionable 
loyalties when she took over.  He commented that the 
controversy left by the changes at the EFCC is "highly 
unfortunate," as it has "left a trail of injuries."  With any 
controversy, he admitted, there are costs; he expressed his 
hope that the operational capacity of the EFCC would not be 
among those costs.  The Ambassador reiterated the importance 
of supporting the EFCC as an institution, without regard to 
personalities. 
 
¶7. (C) FonMin told Ambassador he had just received a courtesy 
call request from Waziri.  He noted that, whenever he had 
taken over a new office, he had always been told that he must 
have "his own team."  His own experience, however, was that 
keeping those with experience in the organization is much 
more useful, and that they then become loyal employees as 
well.  He told Ambassador he will meet with Waziri and share 
his experience with her, and also mention U.S. concerns. 
(Note: In a subsequent meeting between Ambassador and Waziri, 
these concerns were also raised.  Waziri said that she had 
found case files lacking evidence, leaks to the press by 
certain individuals, and an unwillingness to truly improve 
the EFCC from many of those she is redeploying, noting that 
to date the press has highly exaggerated the numbers.  End 
note.)
