Classified By: Classified By: Economics Chief Timothy Lattimer - Reason 
s 1.5(b and d) 
 
¶1.  (C)  Econ Chief delivered ref points and background on 
Aug. 30 to Delia Villamonte,  Director General for 
International Organizations, and Leoncio Hernandez, Director 
for Anti-Terrorist Issues, both with the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA).  Neither Villamonte nor Hernandez offered any 
immediate reaction, other than to note that they would follow 
the matter closely through Panama's mission to the UN and 
that they would share any information they might encounter on 
the subject individuals.  Econ Chief also delivered the same 
material to Deputy Bank Superintendent Amauri Castillo.  He 
said the Bank Superintendent would follow up with any action 
necessitated by the UN Sanction Committee's designation of 
the Saudi Five, should the GOP find assets belonging to these 
individuals in Panamanian banks. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The MFA's Hernandez said the GOP hopes to bring 
together various entities (such as the Bank Superintendent, 
Financial Analysis Unit, and Public Registry) to ensure that 
their personnel are sufficiently up to speed on the 
requirements of UNSCR 1267.  Post would appreciate the 
Department's advice on potential USG training programs or 
materials specific to UNSCR 1267 that might assist the GOP 
accordingly.
