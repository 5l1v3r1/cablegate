SUBJECT: NINTH US-POLISH SOFA PLENARY MAKES PROGRESS, 
ADDRESSES CORE DIFFERENCES 
 
Classified By: CDA Quanrud for reasons 1.4 b and d 
 
¶1. (SBU)  U.S. and Polish delegations made good progress 
during Round Nine of U.S.-Poland SOFA negotiations held in 
Warsaw August 18-20, and addressed in-depth core differences 
in areas of taxation, criminal jurisdiction, claims, and 
burden-sharing.  Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski 
and Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Kremer led the Polish 
delegation.  Kurt Amend, Senior Advisor for Security 
Negotiations and Agreements, led the U.S. delegation. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  In the pre-plenary discussion, heads of delegation 
agreed to cluster unresolved articles around five common 
themes: a) Individuals and entities that receive privileges 
and benefits under the U.S.-Poland SOFA; b) Appropriate 
burdensharing of costs between NATO allies; c) Criminal 
jurisdiction, judicial custody, and claims; d) Taxation; and 
e) Sovereignty.  The delegation heads further agreed to spend 
the first day closing out articles where only minor 
differences remained. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  The sides confirmed prior agreement on articles 1, 
4, 7, 14, 20, 22, 23, 35, and 36.  The sides reached full, 
provisional agreement on the Preamble; Article 16 Discipline; 
Article 25 Military Postal Services; Article 26 
Telecommunications; Article 28 Currency; Article 31 Health; 
and Article 34 Labor.  The sides agreed to drop Article 8 Use 
of Force. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Discussion of the cluster of articles related to 
taxation confirmed strong ongoing differences on 
point-of-sale v. reimbursement of VAT in Article 18 Official 
Tax Exemptions; the status of dependents in Article 19 
Personal Tax Exemptions; exemption from taxation on 
importation of household shipment for members of the force in 
Article 21 Personal Importation and Exportation; and the 
issue of fees versus taxes in Article 27 Logistical Support 
and Utilities. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  Although the sides made some progress on pre-trial 
confinement in Article 15 Detention, Temporary Custody and 
Confinement, there was little movement on Article 13 
Jurisdiction.  The Polish delegation lumped Article 17 Claims 
into this cluster, and refused to discuss it without first 
having resolution of Jurisdiction and Confinement. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  With regard to appropriate burdensharing among 
allies, the Poles were not prepared to lift fees for ranges 
and facilities in Article 6 Military Exercises, nor for use 
of airspace in Article 12 Movement of Aircraft and Vessels. 
 
¶7. (C)  COMMENT.  At the beginning of the round, the Poles 
clearly hoped for significant gains on substantive provisions 
due to the change in leadership of the U.S. delegation.  On 
the big issues, however, there was little progress, as the 
U.S. re-emphasized key USG redlines in response to Polish 
positions.  That said, the Poles showed flexibility on issues 
such as Discipline or Use of Force that seemed intractable 
only a few months ago.  The Polish delegation leads remain 
hamstrung by limitations from above.  To conclude this 
agreement, they will require change in instructions at the 
ministerial level or, at the right point, the direct 
involvement of the Foreign Minister.  END COMMENT 
 
¶8. (SBU)  Senior Advisor Amend has cleared on this cable.
