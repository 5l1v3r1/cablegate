¶1. (S/NF) Summary:  Senior officials from the Islamist Jamiat   Ulema-e-Islam Fazlur Rehman (JUI-F) report increasing concern   over the influence and activities of Pakistani Taliban   sympathizers in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas   (FATA), border areas of Balochistan, and certain districts in   the North West Frontier Province (NWFP).  This is in contrast   with the tactical alliance that still exists between some   JUI-F members and Afghan Taliban in Quetta.  …  Officials contend that Pakistani Taliban   sympathizers have been angered by JUI-F's failure to stem   military and law enforcement actions against them and by its   willingness to cooperate politically with the GOP.  …  JUI-F asserted that they had   been placed on the "front line" in the fight against Taliban   extremism and that their party offered the only viable   alternative to conservative Pashtun tribal elements.  They   sought USG support in pressing the GOP to cooperate more   fully with JUI-F and Deobandi clerics in seeking a negotiated   end to the current stalemate in the Waziristans as a first   step towards countering this trend.  Information in this   report is based on private conversations with reliable   Embassy contacts at senior levels of the JUI-F, who remain   extremely concerned about their personal safety.  End Summary.
 Background
¶2. (S/NF) JUI-F and the Taliban have a long, often   confrontational relationship. … Post-9/11 JUI-F pressured the Taliban to hand over al-Qaeda   suspects to the United States and failing to win its case,   ended formal support to its ideological rival.  With the   advent of Operation Enduring Freedom, JUI-F publicly   criticized United States' action but privately admitted the   Taliban's complicity in its own demise.
 Tacit Understanding
¶3. (S/NF) With the influx of Afghan Taliban and their   Pakistani sympathizers across the border, JUI-F struck a   tacit understanding designed to protect its political   interests in FATA, Balochistan, and NWFP.  According to   senior JUI-F officials, JUI-F agreed to press for allowing a   non-militarized Taliban/Taliban sympathizer presence in these   areas in exchange for Taliban recognition of JUI-F religious   and political supremacy.  With the GOP decision to introduce   the army into FATA, JUI-F's ability to negotiate effectively   between the GOP, the resident tribes, and Pakistani Taliban   sympathizers consistently diminished.  At the same time,   JUI-F officials claim, the Taliban and their initially small   group of sympathizers developed an increasingly strong   following, particularly in North and South Waziristan … Despite this break with Pakistani   Taliban sympathizers from FATA, elements of the JUI-F in   Quetta still retain close ties with Afghan Taliban.
 Threatening JUI-F Interests
¶4. (S/NF) JUI-F officials claimed that over the last year,   the growing pool of Pakistani Taliban sympathizers has   clearly articulated its intention to overturn any previous   understanding with the JUI-F.  While officials were unable to   pinpoint a specific event, one speculated that the JUI-F's   decisions not to protest vigorously the appointment of a   perceived hard-line Peshawar Corps Commander in late 2005 and   Governor in May 2006 were at least in part behind the growing   rift. … Taliban sympathizers criticize JUI-F's   decision to operate within the Pakistani political system,   its general rejection of violence, and its coalition   government with Musharraf's Pakistan Muslim League in   Balochistan.  JUI-F officials report that Pakistani Taliban   sympathizers feel the party has been inadequately strident in   pressing for a negotiated settlement in FATA and blame the   party's approach for the deteriorating security situation in   North and South Waziristan.

¶5. (S/NF) According to JUI-F officials, Pakistani Taliban   sympathizers are using a combination of pressure tactics and   force to exert their influence in North and South Waziristan;   the northern Balochistan districts of Zhob, Musakhel, Killa   Saifullah, Pishin, and Killa Abdullah; and the NWFP districts   of Tank, Dera Ismael Khan, and Bannu -- all areas in which   the JUI-F has been politically powerful and religiously   dominant. … They also point out that many of   the so-called pro-government tribal and religious leaders who   have been killed were actually JUI-F sympathizers.

¶6. (S/NF) In Balochistan, JUI-F officials claim that   Pakistani Taliban sympathizers have used a combination of   threats, intimidation, and outright violence to force local   JUI-F politicians and religious leaders from the districts of   Zhob and Musakhel.  They also report these sympathizers are   periodically occupying government offices in parts of these   districts and establishing parallel law and order   administrative systems. Threats have also reportedly   increased in the neighboring Killa Saifullah, Pishin, and   Killa Abdullah districts, and JUI-F fears that outright   violence may follow.

¶7. (S/NF) In NWFP, JUI-F leaders report that a similar   pattern has emerged in Bannu, Tank, and Dera Ismael Khan   districts -- areas that border the Waziristans and are home   to several prominent JUI-F politicians, including leader   Fazl-ur-Rehman. … One JUI-F source claimed that   Rehman was worried that Taliban sympathizers might back   alternative candidates in the upcoming elections and causing   him and other JUI-F NWFP leaders to lose their seats.
 Casting Blame
¶8. (S/NF) JUI-F officials claimed that the party was actively   pressing the GOP to respond to the threats emanating from   Pakistani Taliban sympathizers.  Its leaders attribute their   present difficulties to U.S. pressure on the GOP to take an   unnecessarily aggressive posture in Waziristan.  JUI-F   continues to believe that a negotiated deal with Taliban   sympathizers in these areas is the best way forward and has   thrown its full support behind the new NWFP Governor's tribal   jirgas.  JUI-F officials also believed that increased GOP law   enforcement and administrative action to counter rising   threats in the settled areas is essential.  JUI-F wants GOP   political support in this regard, arguing that its local   officials and clerics offer the only viable alternative to   the Taliban in these conservative areas. …
 Comment
¶9. … JUI-F's solution of direct negotiations with Taliban   sympathizers is dubious, as GOP negotiations with such groups   (as distinct from tribal leaders) were, at least in part,   responsible for rising Taliban influence in South Waziristan.    While the JUI-F split with Pakistani Taliban emmanating from   the FATA seems clear, elements of the party still retain   close ties with Afghan Taliban fighters engaged in   cross-border infiltration from Quetta, despite JUI-F claims   to the contrary.  End Comment.
