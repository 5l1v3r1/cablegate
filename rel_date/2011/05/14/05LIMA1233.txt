¶1. (C) At the end of a social event on 3/10, Foreign Minister 
Manuel Rodriguez told Ambassador that he would be traveling 
to Geneva on 3/14 to attend the 61st session of the 
Commission on Human Rights, and that he intended to present a 
proposal for reforming the Commission.  Rodriguez said Peru 
believes that the lack of action in passing resolutions 
condemning major human rights violators hurt the credibility 
of Commission.  The Peruvian reform proposal would transform 
the Commission from a political grouping into a Commission of 
experts, who would presumably play a more objective role. 
 
¶2. (C) Rodriguez said he already had some commitments of 
South American support, and he hoped the U.S. would look 
favorably on Peru's proposal as well. 
 
¶3. (C) Embassy received a copy of the Peruvian proposal on 
3/11.  In essence, it calls for creating a new 56-member 
Commission made up of independent experts elected by the 
General Assembly.  Its functions would include:  elaborating 
new international guidelines for protecting human rights; 
protecting, acting as guardian, and monitoring the human 
rights situation in all countries of the world; and 
coordinating human rights functions within the UN system. 
The new organism would have an ordinary session lasting two 
months each year, and would meet in extraordinary sessions as 
conditions warranted.  The full text of the Peruvian proposal 
is being faxed to IO/SHA and to U.S. Mission Geneva (POL).
