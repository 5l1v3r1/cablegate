¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered points (Refs A and B) to Director 
General of Multilateral Affairs Lourdes Puma on August 8. 
Puma said that the GOE had not changed its policy (Refs C and 
D) that it will not publicly declare a position either for or 
against Kosovo's independence.  However, she added that the 
GOE considers it important to recognize the rights of both 
Serbia and the "province of Kosovo."
