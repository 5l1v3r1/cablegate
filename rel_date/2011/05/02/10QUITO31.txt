¶1. (U) Poloff delivered points (refs A-C) to Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Undersecretary for Coordination and Planning Galo Yepez, 
and Acting Director General for North American Affairs Fernando 
Chavez.  Both officials expressed their support for current U.S. 
assistance efforts and the need for military personnel for aid 
distribution and security.  Yepez said that Ecuador's foreign 
policy puts solidarity within Latin America high on its agenda, and 
the Ecuadorian aid should be seen in that light. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) According to Yepez, the GOE plans to send a second official 
aid flight to Haiti, departing on Friday, January 22. He expressed 
concern about receiving permission to land.  Poloff reiterated 
points in Ref B and advised that the GOE should call the Haiti 
FligQ Operations Coordination Center as soon as possible.  Yepez 
said he would put the Ecuadorian air force colonel in charge of the 
operation in touch with the DAO as soon as possible to ensure 
coordination.  The flight will apparently include two water 
treatment units, canned food, and materials to resupply Ecuadorian 
teams on the ground.  Yepez thanked the U.S. military for 
assistance in off-loading supplies from the first Ecuadorian aid 
flight, on January 14. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Poloff raised recent press reports about accusations that 
the U.S. was invading Haiti.  Both MFA officials laughed, and said 
they had both been to Haiti and understood that security had to be 
a high priority.  Yepez, who was on the Ecuadorian aid flight on 
January 14, said it was clear to him that the Marines (and other 
U.S. military personnel) "had been invited."  Yepez said Ecuador 
was also concerned about migration of Haitians.  He noted Ecuador 
had relatively open doors, and that four recent arrivals from Haiti 
have requested permission for 16 family members to join them. 
Yepez expects more of the same, and said it was important for the 
international community to continue to deliver aid "in situ."
