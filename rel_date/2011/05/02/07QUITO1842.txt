¶1.  (U) The following is a weekly Ecuador economic update that 
reports notable developments that are not reported by individual 
cables. 
 
Congress Approves Energy Sovereignty Bill: 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) After rejecting the administration's initial energy 
sovereignty bill (reftel a), Congress approved a revised version 
August 9 after intense debate.  The purpose of the bill is to 
penalize traffickers of contraband petroleum derivatives.  The first 
version of the bill proposed extremely severe penalties and 
explicitly denied recourse to an administrative injunction, which 
industry and Congress rejected.  The second version introduced by 
the Correa administration allowed recourse to an injunction and all 
constitutional rights, and reduced the penalties somewhat (although 
they remained stiff).  Congress further reduced penalties before 
approving the bill.  President Correa must review the law and 
provide any partial vetoes within 10 days. 
 
Energy Emergency; Petroecuador to Receive $358 Million: 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶3. (U) President Rafael Correa declared a state of emergency in the 
country's energy sector.  The emergency decree allows state oil 
company Petroecuador to provide subsidized fuel to thermal 
electricity generators with a 90-day credit of $133 million, to be 
repaid by the Ministry of Economy, and allows the government to draw 
on the Feiseh petroleum reserve fund.  Feiseh will give Petroecuador 
$358 million that will be used to purchase equipment and materials, 
and for work on two Petroecuador projects - a natural gas terminal 
and restoration of the aging Esmeraldas refinery.  (Feiseh receives 
its revenues from petroleum sales from the former Occidental fields 
that were    seized by the government in 2006.) 
 
GOE Seeks Defense Lawyers for Arbitration Cases: 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶4. (U) The GOE has until September 15 to present its arguments that 
the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes 
(ICSID) should not have jurisdiction in the Oxy arbitration case. 
However, the attorney general's office has apparently not yet hired 
a new lawyer to represent the state in its arbitration cases.  The 
attorney general's office began reviewing bids from three interested 
law firms August 6. 
 
Inflation: 
---------- 
 
¶5.  (U) Ecuador's National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC) 
reported that inflation increased in July (up to 0.42% from 0.39% in 
June).  This increase was mainly due to price increases for basic 
consumption products (reftel b), whose prices increased 2.99% versus 
an average of 0.15% for all other products.  Even so, the annual 
inflation rate remains lower than for the preceding year.  Inflation 
for July 2006 to July 2007 was 2.58%, while the rate for July 2005 
to July 2006 was 2.99%.
