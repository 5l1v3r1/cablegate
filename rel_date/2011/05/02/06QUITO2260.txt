¶1. (U) On September 7 EconOff delivered reftel points to 
Ambassador Jaime Barberis of the Sovereignty Section of 
Ecuador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). 
 
¶2. (U) Barberis said that he had met with colleagues from the 
Subsecretariat of Fisheries this morning.  He was surprised 
that Ecuador's balance with the Inter-American Tropical Tuna 
Commission (IATTC) was not current and said that he was 
"sure" that Ecuador would pay its dues "immediately."  He 
said that the private sector, via the Chamber of Fisheries, 
was responsible for payment via contributions from its 
constituents. 
 
¶3. (U) Barberis also mentioned that Ecuador was preparing to 
submit the name of past Ecuadorian Fisheries Under Secretary 
Rafael Eduardo Trujillo as a candidate for the presidency of 
the IATTC and would be sending a summary of his 
qualifications to IATTC members shortly.
