¶1.  On August 2, President Alfredo Palacio devoted a section 
of his televised national address (septel) to trafficking in 
persons (TIP), declaring his government's "priority to combat 
TIP, exploitation, and underage prostitution."  He publicized 
the penal code reforms that criminalize trafficking and said 
he intends to develop an integral approach to protect 
victims, especially children.  In a meeting on August 3, the 
Charge complimented Palacio on his statement.  Palacio 
responded that it is important that people know that 
"combating TIP is a top priority of my government."
