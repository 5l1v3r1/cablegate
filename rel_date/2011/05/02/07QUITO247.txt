 ¶1.  (U) Summary:  Over 3,000 protestors supporting President 
Correa's proposed referendum for the creation of a national 
constituent assembly gathered in front of the National Congress in 
Quito on January 30. Hundreds broke through police barriers and 
stormed the Congressional building.  Unconfirmed reports cited three 
injuries; no AmCits were involved or are likely to be targeted in 
future clashes.  Protest leaders are calling for a continuation of 
demonstrations until Congress blesses the referendum.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Making their voices heard in the most aggressive fashion to 
date, more than 3,000 supporters of President Correa's proposed 
national constituent assembly gathered outside the National Congress 
in Quito on January 30 as the Congress was in session deliberating 
over the assembly statutes.  The rally was led by members of the 
radical leftist Popular Democracy Movement (MPD), campesino 
indigenous organization (FENOCIN) and an ad-hoc selection of 
pro-assembly social groups, including Correa's PAIS movement 
supporters. 
 
¶3.  (U) Hundreds managed to breach the barricades and enter the 
Congress chamber, interrupting debate and causing members to flee. 
The police responded with tear gas.  A journalist was caught in the 
fray and sustained minor injuries.  Two policemen also received 
minor injuries according to unconfirmed reports.  No AmCits were 
affected by the protest.  Similar but smaller pro-assembly 
demonstrations took place in Guayaquil and Cuenca. 
 
¶4. (U) Protestors are expected to regroup this evening at 1800 in 
two city parks, and have vowed to continue their protests until 
Congress approves the controversial referendum proposal.   Members 
of Congress have reportedly been seeking to regroup in a Quito hotel 
to resume debate on the assembly. 
 
¶5.  (U) Today's demonstration follows last week's break-in at the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) (reftel).  Demonstrators 
successfully interrupted proceedings of that institution before it 
referred the issue of the referendum's legality to the Congress. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment:  Today's demonstration marks another attempt by 
pro-government, pro-assembly supporters to exert pressure on 
democratic institutions from the streets, in classic Ecuadorian 
tradition.  Popular frustration with congress was compounded by an 
ill-timed decision (announced on January 29) by Congress' 
administrative committee to raise congressional salaries above 
Correa's, after Correa took office cutting his own salary in half. 
The anti-assembly opposition has accused the government of 
orchestrating the protests, citing Correa's January 27 weekly radio 
address rallying public support for the referendum.  Ironically, a 
majority of congress is prepared to approve the statutes authorizing 
the assembly, if they can proceed with their session - although the 
more radical pro-assembly forces do not recognize congressional 
approval as a necessary step in the process. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) We will issue a warden message warning AmCits to exercise 
caution and avoid the protests.
