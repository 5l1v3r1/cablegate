¶1.  (SBU) EconCouns presented reftel A demarche regarding 
proposed approach for non-agricultural market access (NAMA) 
for small, vulnerable economies to Mentor Villagomez, Under 
Secretary for Economic and Trade Affairs at the Ecuadorian 
 
SIPDIS 
Foreign Ministry.  Villagomez said that Ecuador's initial 
reaction to the proposal is that it is "not bad" for Ecuador, 
but that Ecuador would have to continue to analyze the 
proposal. 
 
¶2.  (U) Villagomez said that he would have to consult with 
his colleagues at the Ministry of Industries regarding the 
specific tariff line impacts that the proposal would have, 
but noted that Ecuador had recently lowered approximately 
1,400 tariff lines to zero.  (As noted in reftel B, Ecuador 
is reducing 1,957 tariff lines to either zero or five 
percent, from the previous levels which had ranged from 2-20 
percent.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Villagomez added that Ecuador is also interested in 
how it can address its offensive NAMA interests in the Doha 
Round, noting as an example that it wants the European Union 
to lower its tariff on Ecuadorian canned tuna (currently over 
20 percent) and to use "GSP-plus" as the starting point for 
negotiations.
