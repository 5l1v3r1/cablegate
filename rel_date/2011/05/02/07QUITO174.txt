REF: STATE 002240 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In response to reftel questions on application 
#050021165, the Embassy has verified that Apeqs-Cotela C.A. 
is the Harris Corporation's Ecuadorian representative.  We 
have also verified the validity of the pending $8,000 
Ecuadorian Joint Command order for spare Harris radio parts. 
The U.S. Military Group (MILGP) has dealt with Apeqs-Cotela 
as the local Harris Corporation representative since 2001, 
noting Apeqs-Cotela's involvement in over $3 million in 
Harris Corporation transactions.  Apeqs-Cotela currently 
assists with product delivery, inventory review, and training 
for new radio systems purchased by the MILGP for the 
Ecuadorian military. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Based on the information provided, we believe 
Apeqs-Cotela to be a reliable recipient of USML items.
