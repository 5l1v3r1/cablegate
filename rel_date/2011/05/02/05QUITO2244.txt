 ¶1.  (SBU) MFA Director of Sovereignty Office Helena Yanes 
responded to RefTel points on September 30.  Yanes said that 
Ecuador agrees in principle to the dangers related to high 
seas transport of dual-use items, but is not ready to commit 
regarding criminalization.  That decision will likely be 
informed by the delegate at the conference in London, she 
said. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  We recommend USDEL engage directly with the 
Ecuadorian delegation on this issue.
