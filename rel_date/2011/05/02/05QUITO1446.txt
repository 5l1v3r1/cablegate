SUBJECT: ECUADOR UNDECIDED ON UN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 114051 
 
¶1.  On June 20, PolOff relayed reftel talking points to MFA 
Human Rights Director Carmen Larrea.  Larrea said Ecuador 
does not have a position on how the UN Commission on Human 
Rights should be reformed.  Ecuador is reviewing all 
proposals including Cuba's, she said, and will look for a 
non-political way to reform the commission.  PolOff 
encouraged Larrea to support our model for a smaller council 
that would take action only in serious situations and where 
all members have solid human rights records. 
 
¶2.  Comment:  Our best guess is that Ecuador will look for a 
way to avoid taking sides as it usually does when both we and 
Cuba are involved.
