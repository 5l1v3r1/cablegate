SUBJECT: PORTUGAL H1N1 UPDATE: NUMBER THREE IN EUROPE 
 
¶1.  According to the European Center for Disease Prevention 
and Control (ECDC) Portugal has the highest rate of new H1N1 
infection in Europe and is third in the total number of cases 
with 1,833 but has no confirmed fatalities to date.  Portugal 
has a population of 10.7 million.  76 additional cases were 
confirmed in the last 24 hours.  Eight patients are 
hospitalized, two of whom are expected to be released from 
the hospital shortly.  Patients here range from 10 months to 
90 years old, with 67 percent between 10 and 29 years old. 
Most of the new cases have occurred in the southern Algarve 
region, a popular domestic and international tourist 
destination. 
 
¶2.  Paulo Moreira of the ECDC Executive Committee maintained 
"the surge of cases in itself means nothing of concern to the 
country."  Cristina Furtado, lead epidemiologist with the 
surveillance unit at the National Health Institute, 
attributed the higher number of cases to the country's 
efforts toward early diagnosis.  Both researchers declined to 
predict when the spread of the illness will peak.  Health 
Director Francisco George, however, said the country is 
experiencing higher than normal rates of influenza infection, 
with 700,000 cases reported in 2009 and more than twice that 
number expected next year.  George expects infection rates to 
increase again with the beginning of the school year. 
 
¶3.  Health Minister Ana Jorge has been criticized recently 
for shortcomings in the dial-in national helpline, which has 
been overwhelmed with calls.  The public has been instructed 
to call in if they suspect they are infected, but faced with 
hold times of 90 minutes or more, patients are instead 
proceeding directly to health centers, possibly infecting 
additional people along the way.  After a meeting with GOP 
health officials, the company operating the health line 
agreed to expand capacity to deal with the increased call 
volume. 
 
¶4.  Despite the recent surge in infection rates Portuguese 
health officials are confident they are adequately prepared 
to deal with the illness.  Portugal has placed an advance 
order for 6 million doses of H1N1 vaccine for 45 million 
euros.  A vaccination campaign focused on the elderly, 
pregnant women, health professionals, and other high-risk 
groups is scheduled to begin September 15.
