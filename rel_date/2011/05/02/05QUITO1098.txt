REF: QUITO 1060 
 
¶1.  Via diplomatic note, the Foreign Ministry denied the 
USG's request to cede jurisdiction over the captain, crew, 
and cargo of the F/V Simon Bolivar, an Ecuador-flagged 
fishing vessel interdicted May 8 while carrying four tons of 
cocaine.  Invoking Articles 4 and 17 of the 1988 UN 
Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances, the ministry declared itself 
"competent over the crimes committed and requests the Embassy 
to communicate with U.S. Navy and Coast Guard officials to 
facilitate the handover of the crew and material evidence to 
Ecuadorian Navy authorities, so that they (the crewmembers) 
might be investigated and tried by competent Ecuadorian 
authorities." 
 
¶2.  In coming days, Embassy staff will engage MFA and Navy 
officials to express the USG's extreme displeasure with 
Ecuador's decision and to advocate stiff sentences for the 
Bolivar's captain and crew.
