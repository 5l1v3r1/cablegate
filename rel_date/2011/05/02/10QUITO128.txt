SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR SOURCE/ORIGIN WAIVER: PROCUREMENT OF SIX 
VEHICLES FOR THE ECUADORIAN NATIONAL POLICE SIU/SIPA UNITS 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Issue: Post requests a source origin waiver from 
geographic code 000 (United States only) to geographic code 935 
(Special Free World) to permit the procurement of vehicles in the 
Host Country local market for operational use by the Ecuadorian 
National Police's Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) and the Ports 
and Airports Investigative Unit (SIPA). 
 
 
 
Cooperating Country: Ecuador 
 
 
 
Authorizing document: LOA dated August 25, 2009 
 
 
 
Project: Sensitive Investigative Unit - SIU and Andean Initiative 
Program

Contracting agent: GSO 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Discussion: Four of these vehicles will be used for 
surveillance operations by the National Police Special 
Investigations Unit (SIU) and two of these vehicles will be used by 
the Ports and Airports Investigative Unit (SIPA).  Both SIU and 
SIPA are highly effective units of the National Police Anti-Drug 
Directorate and cooperate closely with DEA's Quito office.  For the 
security of undercover personnel and operations, it is necessary 
for the SIU and SIPA to use nondescript vehicles that are locally 
common rather than the more conspicuous and distinctive 
U.S.-manufactured vehicles.  The requested vehicles are a needed 
fleet expansion. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) Recommendation:  For the reasons stated above, we recommend 
approval of this request for a source/origin waiver to permit 
acquisition of these project vehicles in Ecuador. 
 
 
 
¶4. (U) Please expedite reply. Thank you.
