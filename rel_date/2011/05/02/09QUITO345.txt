¶1.  (SBU) Ecuador lifted its ban on U.S. pork products that was 
issued because of concerns about the H1N1 virus (reftel c).  The GOE 
issued a new resolution on May 7 that reversed its previous ban on 
imports of pork and pork products, live swine, and genetic material 
from the U.S. and Mexico.  Now, only imports of live swine from 
Canada and other countries where H1N1 flu is present in animals have 
been suspended.  The resolution specifically authorizes the import 
of pork products and genetic materials.  This latest development 
follows the Embassy's presentation of reftel B demarche on May 6, as 
reported in reftel A. 
 
¶2.  (U) The resolution, passed by Ecuador's sanitary authority 
Agrocalidad, was released to the public on May 8.  The measure had 
been shared with Customs, port authorities, airports, and other 
frontier control posts so that they could begin allowing pork 
products into the country, although Agrocalidad noted that it could 
take a few days to reach involved agencies at the working level. 
Although the resolution does not specify an end date for the 
measure, we understand it will be in effect as long as Ecuador's 
state of emergency over the H1N1 flu, essentially through June. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Embassy plans to continue monitoring the situation to 
ensure that the various agencies involved are applying the 
resolution correctly.
