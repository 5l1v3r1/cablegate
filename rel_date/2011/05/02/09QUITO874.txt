SUBJECT: QUARTERS LEASE FOR POLICE 
 
¶1. NAS requests authorization to sign a two-year lease on behalf of 
ICE for quarters to house DGI (Direccion General de Inteligencia), 
an anti-narcotics police intelligence unit, conducts operations on 
money laundering, trafficking in persons, human smuggling and 
transnational crimes of the Ecuadorian National Police. The 
property is a 340-sq meter residencial house located at Calle 
Segunda N44-144 y Ave. del Parque, Casa #4, Colinas del Bosque in 
Quito, Ecuador.  The cost is USD 780.00 per month and the lease 
term would be for two years.  This lease will be a new lease for 
the DGI Unit beginning on October, 2009 to September 30, 2011. 
 
 
 
¶2. Justification:  Due to the nature of its activities, this police 
unit requires an anonymous and secure location separate from 
regular police facilities, which will permit operation of 
controlled sensitive operations.  The National Police do not have a 
suitable facility available for the DGI.
