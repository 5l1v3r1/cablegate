GOVERNMENT CALLS FOR FOREIGN MILITARY HELP 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  CROATIA ISSUED ANOTHER PROTEST JUNE 22 AGAINST 
THE NEW SERB/JNA ATTACKS ON DUBROVNIK WHICH CAUSED 
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO HISTORICAL BUILDINGS IN THE OLD 
TOWN.  THE GOVERNMENT CONDEMNED THE INTENSIFIED 
SHELLING OF SIBENIK, ZADAR, SLAVONSKI BROD AND THE 
REGION OF POSAVINA, AS WELL AS THE CONTINUOUS ATTACKS 
ON SARAJEVO.  THE GOVERNMENT MADE AN APPEAL TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR A COLLECTIVE, EFFICIENT 
"MILITARY INTERVENTION," BECAUSE THE PRESENT 
MEASURES, CONDEMNATIONS AND SANCTIONS HAVE PROVED 
INADEQUATE.  ITS APPEAL WAS MOTIVATED BY THE 
CONTINUING ACCUMULATION OF "VICTIMS, FAMINE, SHORTAGE 
OF WATER, ELECTRICITY AND MEDICINES."  THE GOVERNMENT 
STATEMENT STRESSED "THE AGONY OF THE CITIZENS OF 
DUBROVNIK CAUSED BY THE PROLONGED SIEGE, ISOLATION, 
AND CONTINUOUS EXPOSURE TO SHELLING AND SHOOTING."

EC REPRESENTATIVE WOLTMANN DISCUSSED "PINK ZONE" 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4.  EC REPRESENTATIVE DIETER WOLTMANN TOLD SIBENIK 
COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES JUNE 23 THAT UNPROFOR WILL 
TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY OVER SECTOR SOUTH BY JUNE 
25, IF BOTH SIDES -- CROATIAN AND JNA AUTHORITIES -- 
AGREE WITH AMENDMENTS TO THE VANCE PLAN WORKED OUT BY 
GENERAL NAMBIAR.  THESE AMENDMENTS FORESEE WITHDRAWAL 
OF CANNONS TO 30 KMS FROM THE COUNTIES' BORDERS 
(UNDER THE CONTROL OF UNPROFOR), OF TANKS AND OTHER 
HEAVY ARMAMENT TO 10 KMS, AND FOR INFANTRY TO 5 KMS. 
THIS "TERRITORY" WOULD REPRESENT A "DEMARCATION LINE" 
OF UNPROFOR CONTROL.  THE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PLAN 
DOES NOT UNDERCUT CROATIAN AUTHORITY, ACCORDING TO 
WOLTMANN.  HE ALSO SUGGESTED A CROATIAN "AMNESTY" FOR 
THOSE RESIDENTS IN THE CONTESTED AREAS NOT INVOLVED 
IN WAR CRIMES. 
 
CROATIAN MOD PROTESTS DUBROVNIK AND "EAST" ATTACKS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  THE CROATIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE ISSUED A PUBLIC 
PROTEST JUNE 23, OF VIOLATION OF THE SARAJEVO 
AGREEMENT BY SERB/JNA FORCES.  IT ASKED UNPROFOR AND 
THE EC TO APPLY ALL POSSIBLE MEANS TO STOP CEASE-FIRE 
VIOLATIONS ON OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  THE PROTEST 
CITED HEAVY CANNON ATTACKS ON SIBENIK, ZUPANJA, SISAK 
AND SUNJA, AS WELL AS DUBROVNIK.  INFANTRY FIRE WAS 
OPENED ON CROATIAN ARMY POSITIONS NEAR OSIJEK FROM 
SERB BASES IN SECTOR EAST, AN AREA NOW OSTENSIBLY
