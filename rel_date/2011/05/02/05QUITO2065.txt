¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The GOE's representative at the September 
7-9 Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG) meeting in 
Buenos Aires told us the GOE shares USG concern over progress 
of the declaration and agrees that a leaders statement may be 
a necessary alternative.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  MFA summit coordinator Ambassador Mauricio 
Montalvo told PolChief on September 6 that the GOE shares USG 
concern over the plodding pace of negotiations of a 
Declaration and Plan of Action for the 2005 Summit of the 
Americas.  Previous negotiating sessions were painfully slow, 
he said, and at this rate at least one additional SIRG 
meeting would be necessary in October to have any hope for 
consensus at the November summit meeting. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Montalvo said the GOE is "practical" and willing to 
consider alternatives such as a leaders statement focusing on 
the role of democratic governance, the private sector, the 
free market and trade in generating jobs and prosperity. 
Foreign Minister Parra shares the view, he said, that the 
declaration negotiation is proceeding too slowly and that 
alternatives should be considered. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) We recommend further engagement by the USdel with 
Montalvo in Buenos Aires.
