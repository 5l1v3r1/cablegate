¶1.  (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points on March 16 to 
Lourdes Puma Puma, MFA Director General for Multilateral 
Affairs.  Puma expressed GOE's concern over the March 13 
violence in Zimbabwe, noting that Ecuador has always spoken 
out against such violence.  Puma described the attacks of 
peaceful demonstrators as a "clear violation of human 
rights".  While she could not commit to any specific action 
in the Human Rights Council, she expressed her opinion that 
GOE will be willing to pursue all possible courses of action 
described in reftel.  Puma promised to transmit our concerns 
to the GOE Mission in Geneva and to the highest levels of the 
Foreign Ministry as well.  She expected GOE position to take 
shape by March 23. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Post's Public Affairs section will encourage its 
contacts, with discretion, to bring public attention to the 
situation in Zimbabwe in Ecuadorian media.
