SUBJECT: EMBASSY INTERNS REACH OUT TO AFRO-ECUADORIAN YOUTH 
 
¶1.  As part of the US Mission's public diplomacy outreach to youth 
and non-traditional audiences, on July 17th a group of six Embassy 
interns presented the USG-produced paper show illustrating the 
"Legacy of Martin Luther King" and led related activities at Colegio 
Roberto Luis Cervantes in the city of Esmeraldas.  A primary goal of 
this project was to present Afro-Ecuadorian students with examples 
of African-American and Afro-Ecuadorian leadership in an effort to 
nurture common knowledge, interests and values while offering a 
positive vision of professional and personal achievement.  The 
Embassy interns worked directly with about 70 students in their 
final year of high school and the Martin Luther King exhibition was 
placed in a central location for all students to observe.  The 
exhibition consisted of visuals and short bios of prominent 
African-Americans who have made a significant impact in the fields 
of visual arts, politics, business and education.  To compliment the 
exhibition, the Embassy interns and Peace Corps volunteers led 
non-formal educational activities geared toward building 
self-esteem, leadership development and encouraging a cross-cultural 
dialogue.  Activities supporting the paper show dealt with 
goal-setting and personal vision.  Embassy interns encouraged 
students to creatively express their personal vision for where they 
hope to be in ten years as well as to identify and set goals in 
order to achieve their vision. 
 
¶2.  The project generated strong participation and interest among 
the students and received a positive reception from school 
officials.  The exhibition and related activities supported the 
joint State/USAID strategic goals of promoting international 
understanding, developing young leaders through public diplomacy 
outreach, and supporting democracy and the rule of law by 
encouraging citizen participation in government.
