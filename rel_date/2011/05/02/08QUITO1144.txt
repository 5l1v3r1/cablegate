¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  On November 26, the GOE raised tariffs to WTO 
ceiling limits on 940 consumer goods from non-FTA partners. 
Foodstuffs, white goods and small appliances, paper products, and 
others have been increased to an average rate of 29%.  It appears 
the GOE instituted this largely as a balance of payments measure to 
curb imports.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ecuador's Council for Foreign Trade and Investment 
(COMEXI), the GOE's trade policy committee, increased import tariffs 
on 940 products.  COMEXI stated that imports of those products 
totaled $1 billion, and the tariff hike should increase government 
revenues by $85.5 million.  The majority of the 940 products 
previously faced tariffs of between 5 and 20%.  The tariffs have now 
been raised to the maximum levels allowable under Ecuador's WTO 
commitments.  The average tariff for the 940 products was 18%; with 
the increases it is now 29%. 
 
¶3.  (U) Products subject to tariff increases include foodstuffs 
(fish, meat, fruit and vegetables, nuts, teas, cereals, rice, and 
condiments); white goods such as stoves, ovens, and microwaves; 
small appliances such as blenders and hairdryers; paper products 
(notebooks, toilet paper, diapers); floor coverings; suitcases and 
purses; cameras, and decorative household items, among other 
products.  Tariffs on some construction materials were also raised. 
Notably, the tariff on cellular phones was raised to 15% (after 
being dropped from 15% to zero in September). 
 
¶4.  (U) The tariff increases will not apply to products from FTA 
partner countries, meaning products from important trading partners 
Colombia, Peru, and Chile will not be affected.  However, U.S. and 
Chinese products will be.  Approximately $160 million worth of U.S. 
imports will be affected, with washing machines, optical media, 
radio and television electronic parts, sauces and condiments, and 
sound systems at the top of the list.  Some toys, luxury vehicles, 
kitchenware, and carpets will also be affected.  Cell phones are 
most affected, but since the tariff on cell phones was only dropped 
to zero in September, the increase merely raises the rate back to 
where it was in August. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The purpose of the tariff increases was reportedly to 
reduce the impact of the financial crisis, falling petroleum prices, 
and the increase in prices of inputs.  According to the document 
issued by COMEXI announcing the increases, tariffs constitute "an 
instrument of economic policy that should promote productive 
activities in the country and establish methods of protecting 
national production."  However, business people in Ecuador have said 
they believe it is an attempt to curb imports.  Some products, such 
as cell phones, are not manufactured in Ecuador at all, so the 
argument for protecting national production does not hold for this 
product.  The President of the Chamber of Commerce of Quito 
complained that the measure would increase contraband as importers 
seek to avoid the higher tariffs. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  This is the latest in a string of tariff 
adjustments by the GOE, following tariff reductions on inputs.  Last 
fall, the GOE took similar action, reducing tariffs on inputs and 
increasing them on clothing, jewelry, foodstuffs, and other 
consumption goods (ref B).  However, this year's measure increases 
tariffs much more than before - to WTO ceiling rates, and appears to 
be aimed at curbing imports in response to Ecuador's deteriorating 
balance of payments situation as oil prices fall (ref A).  This 
measure alone will not be sufficient to address the balance of 
payments pressure, since this does not cover a wide swath of 
imports, including capital and intermediate goods and goods imported 
from FTA partners.  If oil prices remain low, we may see more of 
these measures or non-tariff measures.  In fact, COMEXI recently 
instituted a new standards requirement that also appears to be aimed 
at curbing imports.
