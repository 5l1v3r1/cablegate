MANTA FOL AGREEMENT 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Embassy received a faxed copy of a diplomatic 
note from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 
29, 2008, at 6:36pm notifying of the GOE's decision to 
terminate the Agreement of Cooperation on the Manta 
Forwarding Operating Location (FOL).  Minutes before the MFA 
sent the fax, the MFA issued a press bulletin confirming that 
the MFA had officially notified the USG of its decision.  The 
original diplomatic note was given personally by the Acting 
Foreign Minister Jose Valencia to the Charge on July 30.  We 
have sent an electronic copy of the diplomatic note and annex 
to WHA/AND.  Following is the Embassy's unofficial 
translation of the diplomatic note.

THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, COMMERCE AND INTEGRATION

In this regard and according to the conversations held 
between representatives of both countries, the Government of 
the Republic of Ecuador officially communicates to the 
Honorable Embassy of the United States of America, its 
decision to terminate the agreement subscribed on November 
12, 1999.  Likewise, and based on understandings attained, 
the operations conducted by the Forward Operating Location 
(FOL) in the Manta Base will be suspended beginning the month
