REF: STATE 159113 
 
¶1. (SBU) PolOff delivered RefTel points on September 12 to 
MFA Director for Multilateral Affairs, Miguel Mendez, 
congratulating the GOE for its work on establishing the IAEA 
Committee on Safeguards and Verification and requesting GOE 
views on organizational and substantive issues related to the 
Committee. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mendez said the GOE considers the creation of the 
Committee "an important step towards a more open, transparent 
global dialogue on nuclear non-proliferation."  He reiterated 
the GOE position that states who support terrorist activities 
should not be allowed to develop nuclear programs, but added 
that if a nation, like Iran, wants to harness nuclear energy 
for domestic consumption, they should be given the "benefit 
of the doubt."  He added that all available diplomatic means 
should be utilized to solve the Iran question.  Mendez also 
expressed concern over reports of a new USG strategic 
doctrine authorizing nuclear preemptive strikes against 
terrorist groups and rogue nations. 
 
¶3. (SBU) PolOff also delivered RefTel points to Executive 
Director of the Ecuadorian Commission on Atomic Energy, Dr. 
Marco Bravo Salvador.  Dr. Bravo said the GOE is supportive 
of unspecified changes in the IAEA, particularly in the area 
of nuclear non-proliferation.  On a separate but related 
subject, Dr. Bravo said the Commission is drafting a revision 
to Ecuador's nuclear control law to increase domestic 
security of reactors and reduce radioactive exposure by 
requiring additional licensed, registered inspectors. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Mendez's reference to Iran suggests that 
the GOE may support the EU's more permissive approach to 
restricting Iran's nuclear program.  End Comment.
