¶1.  (U) Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Francisco Carrion on 
September 12 announced that the GOE would host a meeting of 
the UN's Alliance of Civilizations in Quito September 24-25. 
Carrion stressed the importance of the initiative and said 
the meeting would help identify areas for increased 
communication between the West and the Arab world.  He 
discussed the need to find "peaceful solutions" to the 
current global terrorist threat and said that the Alliance, 
through increased global dialogue, cultural exchange, and the 
eradication of social and economic inequalities, was trying 
to find these answers. 
 
¶2.  (U) Announced by the UN Secretary-General in 2005 and 
co-sponsored by Spain and Turkey, the initiative was 
developed to "bridge divides and overcome prejudice, 
misconceptions, misperceptions, and polarization which 
potentially threaten world peace."  The Alliance is expected 
to deliver to the Secretary-General a report with 
recommendations and a plan of action later this year. 
 
¶3.  (U) Post would appreciate any relevant guidance from the 
Department on the Alliance of Civilizations initiative, as 
well as USG participation (if any) in the September 24-25 
meeting.
