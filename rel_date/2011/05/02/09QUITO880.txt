SUBJECT: LEASE WAIVER FOR POLICE 
 
¶1. NAS requests authorization to sign a two-year lease for 
administrative facilities for a specialized police intelligence 
unit of the Ecuadorian National Police that cooperates with 
DHS/ICE.  The police unit conducts operations against money 
laundering, trafficking in persons, human smuggling and other 
transnational criminal organizations.  The property is a 340-sq 
meter residencial house located at Calle Segunda N44-144 y Ave. del 
Parque, Casa #4, Colinas del Bosque in Quito, Ecuador.  The cost is 
USD 780 per month and the lease term would be for two years.  This 
will be a new lease.  The lease period is October 1, 2009 to 
September 30, 2011. 
 
 
 
¶2. Justification:  Due to the nature of its activities, this police 
unit requires an anonymous and secure location separate from 
regular police facilities, which will permit operation of 
controlled sensitive operations.  The Ecuadorian National Police do 
not have a suitable facility available for this police unit.
