REF: STATE 4746 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Ambassador discussed reftel points with FM 
Francisco Carrion in a one-on-one meeting on January 13, 
requesting GOE support for management reforms and 
emphasizing the need for a more credible Human Rights 
Council. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) FM Carrion said that the UN has great importance 
to Ecuador, a small and poor country deeply committed to 
the UN system.  He agreed that a well-managed, transparent, 
accountable and efficient UN would especially benefit 
Ecuador and other developing countries.  The UNSC offers a 
unique opportunity for countries like Ecuador to 
participate, he said.  UNSC expansion should not preclude 
that rotating opportunity for small countries to play a 
role. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Carrion was generally supportive of USG 
priorities to eliminate obsolete or ineffectual programs 
and give the UN SecGen the authority to re-deploy resources 
from lower to higher priority programs. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Carrion was enthusiastic about the creation of 
the new Human Rights Council, and agreed that the UNHRC had 
become "a joke."  The GOE would be willing to discuss 
criteria to prevent human rights violators from joining the 
new Council.  He did not comment substantively on the 
continued need for country specific initiatives in the 
Council. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  We will continue to discuss these UN 
issues with other MFA officials but are encouraged by 
Carrion's initial reaction to our reform proposals.
