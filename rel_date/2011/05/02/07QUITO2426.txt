MACHALA POWER LAWSUIT REJECTED; RICE EXPORT BAN 
 
¶1.  (U) The following is a weekly economic update for Ecuador that 
reports notable developments that are not reported by individual 
cables. 
 
Environmental License Granted to Petrobras 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 23, the GOE granted an environmental license to 
Brazilian oil company Petrobras, which would allow it to start 
commercial production in Block 31 in 2009.  The GOE initially 
granted Petrobras the environmental license in 2004, but the 
Ministry of Environment suspended it in August 2005 due to 
environmental sensitivities over the block being located next to the 
Yasuni National Park.  The issuance of the license comes on the 
heels of a surprise GOE decree to increase the state share of 
foreign oil companies' "extraordinary oil revenue" to 99 percent and 
threats to Petrobras for nonpayment of extraordinary revenues over 
the last year. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Petrobras had previously anticipated investing $300 million 
to obtain up to 40,000 barrels of crude per day from the block, but 
plans are now on hold pending contract renegotiations with the GOE 
over the "99 percent" decree.  The company argues that its new 
environmental plan contains proposals that will reduce the 
environmental impact of drilling; for example, it plans to minimize 
access routes to the oil field, bury pipelines underground, and 
place the oil processing center outside Yasuni National Park. 
However, several environmental organizations and indigenous groups 
oppose the decision, arguing that it will damage the Amazon 
ecosystem. 
 
Machala Power Lawsuit Rejected 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Tribunal of Administrative Disputes of Quito rejected 
U.S electricity company Machala Power's lawsuit against Conelec and 
Categ October 16 for administrative reasons.  Machala Power had 
filed a case against the National Council of Electricity (Conelec) 
and the Temporary Administration Corporation of Guayaquil (Categ) 
for nonpayment for electricity generated and sold to Categ in 2004 
and 2005.  The company demanded USD 77 million in payment.  The 
court claimed it did not have jurisdiction over Categ because the 
company is registered in Guayaquil, and in addition does not take 
commercial cases.  This was not an unexpected outcome.  Meanwhile, 
Machala Power is proceeding with international arbitration because 
of the payment arrears, but maintains that it would prefer a 
negotiated settlement. 
 
Ban on Rice Exports Leads to Increased Contraband 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Despite a September ban on rice exports from Ecuador 
intended to prevent domestic rice prices from increasing, members of 
the Rice Industrialists Corporation of Ecuador (Corpcom) claim 
Ecuadorian rice is being smuggled over the border to Colombia and 
Peru where prices are higher.  Corpcom representatives made a 
statement October 23 demanding the GOE exercise greater control of 
the borders.  According to Hugo Poveda, Corpcom's President, the 
prohibition was initially effective in controlling rice prices but 
contraband is now causing prices to rise.
