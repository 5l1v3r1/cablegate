SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-LICENSE/PRE-SHIPMENT 
END-USE CHECK ON LICENSE 050147882 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-license/pre-shipment check on license 050147882 for 
the export of ballistic plates to Ecuador. Post is requested 
to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: This check is to assure that the 
end-user, Armada del Ecuador (Tel: 5934-2203353), has 
legitimately ordered the ballistic plates listed below (NOTE: 
Ballistic plates are inserts used in body armor). 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of this transaction by making appropriate inquires to 
authorities at Armada del Ecuador. Particular attention 
should be paid to the quantities on the export license 
versus the quantities expected by Armada del Ecuador. 
 
In its reply, Post is also encouraged to comment on any other 
information pertinent to these transactions such as security 
of facilities, inventory procedures, end-use, and concerns 
about the entities involved.
