¶1.    (SBU) PolChief delivered RefTel points to MFA U/S for 
Multilateral Affairs and CICTE delegation head Mauricio 
Montalvo on March 16.  Montalvo said the GOE also was taken 
aback by Venezuela's alternate declaration, and offended by 
the interruption of the ongoing negotiation.  He said the GOE 
seeks to "continue to play a constructive role" in CICTE 
negotiations and will seek to conclude the existing draft of 
the San Carlos Declaration. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Montalvo expressed willingness to collaborate and 
meet with the USDel to the CICTE session in Bogota on a 
bilateral basis.  Please advise if USDel wishes to offer a 
specific date and time for such a meeting.
