SUBJECT: SLOVAKIA: INFORMATION FOR CONGRESSIONAL REPORT ON 
EUROPEAN ASSISTANCE TO ANDEAN REGION 
 
REF: STATE 27676 
 
¶1.  The Director of the Department for Official Development 
Assistance at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Peter Hulenyi, 
reports that the GOS does not currently give any bilateral 
contributions to the Andean region. Latin America is not 
considered a priority by the GOS, and Hulenyi does not 
anticipate that developmental assistance for this region will 
be included on the GOS's upcoming agenda. 
 
¶2.   A minor portion (4.6 percent) of GOS contributions to 
the EU's general budget are earmarked for developmental 
assistance.  However, this allotment is utilized for 
countries throughout the world, not just the Andean region. 
The EU determines which countries will benefit from the 
overall budget for assistance.
