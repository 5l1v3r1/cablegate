SUBJECT: TFAH01: Ecuador's President intends to visit Haiti on 
January 28 
 
¶1. (SBU) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for 
Coordination and Planning Galo Yepez informed Poloff and DAO 
representative that Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa intends to 
visit Haiti on January 28.  Yepez emphasized repeatedly that Correa 
would visit Port-au-Prince in his capacity as President of Ecuador 
and President of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR).  The 
Government of Ecuador requests landing slots for the President's 
plane, an Embraer Legacy 600, and for a C130 flight carrying 9 tons 
of food, medicine, and water that the GOE would like to land 
shortly before the President's arrival. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Yepez said that Correa would arrive in Santo Domingo at 
approximately 11:00 am Dominican Republic time, meet with Dominican 
President Leonel Fernandez, then depart for Port-au-Prince, with an 
expected arrival at approximately 12:30 Haitian time, to meet with 
President Rene Preval and the Ecuadorian MINUSTAH contingent. 
Ecuador's Minister of Health and the Secretary of National Risk 
Management will accompany Correa.  PolOff and DAO representative 
advised Yepez that we would immediately inform the Department of 
this request, and repeated that getting two landing slots in Port 
au Prince on January 28 could be difficult. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Yepez also said that the second official aid flight to 
Haiti would depart Saturday, January 23 for the Dominican Republic. 
Materials carried in that plane would be delivered overland, and 
the Ecuadorian Search and Rescue team currently on the ground in 
Port-au-Prince would likewise travel by road to Santo Domingo and 
depart for Ecuador on the return flight.
