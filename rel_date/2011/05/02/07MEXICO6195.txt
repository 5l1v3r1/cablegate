SUBJECT: MEXICO RECASTING PLAN PUEBLA 
 
¶1.  Bosco Marti Acencio, the Foreign Ministry's point person 
on Plan Puebla, discussed with poloff December 6 GOM efforts 
to reinvigorate this initiative created originally with a 
view to fostering greater cooperation and integration among 
Mexico and its Central American Neighbors.   At the outset of 
Plan Puebla, members had discussed cooperation on 
infrastructure projects relating to roads, phones, 
electricity and a cross border pipeline.  Marti conceded the 
plan had produced underwhelming results as States had enough 
trouble developing their own national proposals on these 
ambitious endeavors much less finding a way to integrate 
these efforts effectively with their neighbors. 
 
¶2.  Marti signaled a desire for the group to focus on more 
pragmatic areas for cooperation including inter alia epidemic 
illnesses (dengue, malaria), natural disasters, climate 
change, etc. Coordination on infrastructure projects would 
continue but in the meantime the group would try to establish 
a track record of success on less complicated matters.  This 
was important not only politically but also financially. 
Approximately 80 percent of Plan Puebla's funding comes in 
the form of loans from the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IDB).  According to Marti, the IDB is predisposed to support 
lower cost, more focused projects. 
 
¶3.  Marti advised that Colombia, Ecuador and Peru seek to 
join the initiative.  He indicated their participation 
created an opportunity to change the name of this cooperative 
arrangement and hopefully allow the group to establish a more 
dynamic reputation with a new name.  The June 2008 meeting of 
the group's Presidents should provide the best opportunity to 
invite new members to participate and anoint the group with 
its new name.
