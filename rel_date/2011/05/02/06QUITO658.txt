APPLICATION 05-989811 
 
REF: STATE 26902 
 
Â¶1.  (U)  Embassy offices found no incriminating evidence on 
RefTel user, David Rolando Hurtado.  RSO law enforcement 
sources did, however, confirm that Mr. Hurtado's firearms 
dealer license expired on February 3, 2006; they found no 
evidence that he was in the process of renewing it.  Local 
law enforcement officials also confirmed that Mr. Hurtado was 
no longer located at the address provided on the RefTel 
application.  His new location, which is a small restaurant, 
is 232 Larga Street, Cuenca, Azuay province.  Police believe 
that he may now be illegally selling firearms.  Given this 
information, the Embassy recommends denial of his application.
