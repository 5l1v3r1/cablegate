APPLICATION 05-986059 
 
REF: STATE 11750 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In response to RefTel questions on application 
05-986059, Embassy offices verified that Monica Cecilia 
Herrera Suasnavas is the owner of Sierra Nevada Adventure and 
Guns, a legitimate, registered firearms dealer.  Ms. Herrera 
and her brother, Francisco Herrera, have operated the 
business for nine years.  They owned an arms business in 
Machala for one year, closed it in 1997-1998 and moved their 
operation to Quito.  Embassy security did an initial site 
visit on March 21. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) PolOff met with Francisco Herrera in the Sierra 
Nevada store on March 27 to verify RefTel points.  Mr. 
Herrera told PolOff that his sister is the owner of the 
company, but that he handles the day-to-day operations, and 
that another family member also works with them.  He said 
that he is a long time associate of Mr. M.G. Suber, but has 
not done business with his company since 2002-2003.  Monica 
Herrera is a professor at the Technological University of 
America in Quito, it appears that she spends little time 
actually working in or managing the store. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Sierra Nevada's security measures include a series 
of panic buttons connected to the main security alarm system, 
and a remote access button for entry through the front door. 
Mr. Herrera told PolOff that potential buyers select desired 
firearms from a catalog; there are no actual guns on display 
in the store.  He said that more established customers are 
allowed to view sample models they have secured behind a 
locked, metal grate.  Their weapons stock, according to Mr. 
Herrera, is kept at a separate location under heavy security. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Sierra Nevada's clientele is composed mostly of 
members of the Ecuadorian Federation of Shooting Practice; 
Mr. Herrera provided PolOff a list of members that frequent 
his establishment.  He said that while they are open to the 
general public, the majority of their business comes from the 
Federation.  Mr. Herrera confirmed that the guns purchased 
from STI International would be shipped directly to Sierra 
Nevada, that no foreign consignee would be involved. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Based on the information provided, we believe 
Sierra Nevada would be a reliable recipient of USML items.
