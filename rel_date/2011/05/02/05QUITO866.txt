SUBJECT: ECUADOR WILL ABSTAIN ON GUANTANAMO RESOLUTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 69823 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On April 19, PolOff conveyed reftel pertinent to 
Carmen Larrea in the MFA's Human Rights Office and requested 
the GOE oppose Cuba's resolution on Guantanamo.  Larrea 
thanked us for sharing the draft resolution, and said the GOE 
will follow its well-established position of abstaining on 
all matters related to Cuba.   PolOff emphasized that the 
resolution is clearly a retaliatory act; Larrea did not offer 
any procedural suggestions to block the measure. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The DCM followed up on the issue with the FM's 
advisor Jose Nunez.  Nunez said the GOE will abstain and 
emphasized that the decision is firm.  Acting on a request 
from the US Mission in Geneva, the DCM also raised a USG 
concern about the Like-Minded Group resolution on human 
rights and mentioned the Latin American's group opposition to 
the matter.  Nunez promised to review the resolution and get 
back to us.
