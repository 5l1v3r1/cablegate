SUBJECT: PANAMANIAN AMBASSADOR TO SWEDEN QUESTIONS VISA REVOCATION 
 
REF: (A) STATE 103325 (B) STOCKHOLM 000663 
 
¶1. (SBU) Panamanian Ambassador to Sweden Cecilio Eduardo Simon 
English (DPOB: 01-OCT-1951, Panama) met with DCM and Consul on 14 
October in reference to reftel A notice that his B1/B2 visa has been 
revoked under INA 212(A)(3).  The visibly distressed Ambassador 
stated that he was not an enemy of the United States and that the 
revocation was bewildering and personally embarrassing. 
 
¶2. (SBU) English voiced concern that he was being punished for his 
past political opposition to the U.S. invasion of Panama, or his 
later studies in Cuba.  If so, he wondered why he had later received 
a number of U.S. visas and had traveled to the United States on at 
least six different occasions without incident, including once with 
the International Visitors Program, and another in connection with a 
USAID grant he received to promote rule of law in Central America. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The DCM assured Ambassador English that the revocation was 
not in response to any perceived political position or opinion he 
held.  Instead, he reviewed with Ambassador English the text of INA 
212(A)(3), and noted the visa had been revoked on Department orders 
as a precaution due to to what appeared to be an allegation of 
criminal activity, for which the Embassy had no further information. 
 He advised the Ambassador to inquire directly with the Department 
through the Panamanian Embassy in Washington.  The DCM added that 
the Ambassador should reapply at the Embassy if he wished to 
determine his eligibility for a future visa.  Ambassador English 
said he understood the Embassy's position, and that he would do the 
same in our shoes.  He added that both his Ministry and Embassy in 
Washington were informed of the case and may inquire further.
