¶5. (SBU) Minister of Government and Justice (MOGJ) Hector 
Aleman on July 21 told Pol Specialist that he had already 
begun private negotiations with the teachers' and doctors' 
unions.  His job is to find non-radical groups to negotiate 
with and to isolate the radicals.  According to Aleman, the 
GOP believes SUNTRACS will not accept any solution to CSS 
reforms.  When asked what the GOP would do if the deadline 
passes without an agreement, Aleman only responded:  "We are 
working hard to prevent that from happening."  In a separate 
conversation, Comptroller General Dani Kuzniecky expressed 
disappointment that Cabinet meetings and government 
committees were not discussing the National Dialogue at all. 
Kuzniecky said that the GOP had no plan "B" if the talks 
fail. 
 
Comment: Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶6. (SBU) High public expectations for a National 
Dialogue-negotiated resolution to CSS reform with buy-in from 
all sectors will only create more trouble for the GOP if it 
is caught holding the bag should negotiations fail. 
According to a recent La Prensa poll, 62% of Panamanians hope 
that the Dialogue will come up with proposals to save CSS. 
On the other hand, public support for the National Dialogue 
also indicates that FRENADESO's stalling will not win public 
support.  The pendulum, at least for now, has swung toward 
the government:  in early July, President Torrijos's approval 
rating moved up to 39%, from a crushingly low, CSS-related 
24% in June (reftel C).
