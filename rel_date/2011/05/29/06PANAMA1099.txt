Â¶1. (SBU) Pol Counselor delivered reftel talking points to MFA 
Deputy Ricardo Duran.  Duran told Pol Counselor he was 
doubtful that Panama would accept migrants from Guantanamo 
but he would check with MFA for a final answer.  Comment: 
Duran's answer is a diplomatic "no."  In recent years, Panama 
has shown little receptiveness to refugees, even from 
neighboring countries such as Colombia.
