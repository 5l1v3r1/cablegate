¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  A deadly March 21 fire that ensued following the 
outbreak of violence motivated the GOP to introduce anti-crime 
legislation on April 4 that includes provisions for longer detention 
of juvenile offenders (Ref A).  Prominent media attention to 
gang-related violence has raised alarm bells with the public. 
Panama's major cities do appear to have seen a rise in gang 
violence.  However, there is little evidence of close ties to Maras 
or other major gang organizations in Central America.  In addition, 
we estimate that major drug organizations do not use local gangs for 
trafficking purposes.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) On March 21, a gang turf battle led to a deadly fire in the 
impoverished Curundu area of Panama City.  A subsequent raid of the 
area by police yielded the arrest of dozens of alleged gang members, 
most of them under age 18.  Media reporting of the next-day release 
of all but one of the arrestees highlighted the weakness of local 
laws regarding arrest and detention of juvenile offenders. 
 
¶3.  (U) In his March 29 address to the nation, President Torrijos 
announced the imminent introduction to the National Assembly of an 
anti-crime bill (Ref A).  Among other provisions, this bill includes 
a package of reforms aimed at combating juvenile and gang-related 
crimes, such increasing the post-arrest maximum detention period as 
well the ceiling for prison time for crimes committed as a minor. 
Torrijos draft legislation was delivered to the National Assembly on 
April 3, and the National Assembly, which has fast-tracked the bill, 
will begin debate following Easter. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  The Embassy Law Enforcement Working Group 
(LESWG) met on April 4 to discuss the gang dynamic in Panama and 
concluded that, while small local gangs engage in regular criminal 
activity, they did not have direct links to major gang entities in 
Central America, such as the Maras.  In addition, post estimated 
that Panamanian gangs did engage in small scale drug selling, but 
they were not regularly used by major trafficking organizations for 
moving large quantities of drugs.  The LESWG agreed to continue to 
work closely with the police, however, in training and provision of 
equipment to keep on top of the evolution of local gangs.  Post will 
continue to track the gang phenomenon in coming months and report 
significant developments.
