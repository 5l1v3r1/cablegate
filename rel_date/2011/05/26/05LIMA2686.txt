¶1. (C) Ambassador Struble spoke June 14 to Hector Quintero, 
Colombian Ambassador to Peru, regarding the visit of 
Colombian Ambassador to the U.S. Luis Alberto Moreno to Lima. 
 Quintero explained that Ambassador Moreno had met with 
President Alejandro Toledo that morning to seek Peruvian 
support for Moreno's candidacy for the IDB presidency. 
Quintero said that President Toledo told Moreno Peru is 
reviewing the possibility of fielding its own candidate for 
the IDB presidency.  Toledo added, however, that if Peru 
fails to offer a candidate or sees its candidate fail to 
prosper, Peru would not only support Ambassador Moreno but 
campaign vigorously on his behalf. 
 
¶2. (C)  Prior to this, on Friday, June 10, Ambassador Struble 
discussed the IDB race with Foreign Minister Manuel Rodriguez 
Cuadros.  The Minister said he had not yet had the chance to 
consult with President Toledo, but noted the MFA wants to put 
forward ex-Prime Minister and current World Bank Vice 
President Roberto Danino.  Ambassador Struble relayed this 
information to Ambassador Quintero on June 13.  Quintero 
responded that President Toledo had avoided specifying who 
Peru would nominate for the IDB job; Quintero had the 
impression it might be Economy and Finance Minister Pedro 
Pablo Kuczynski (PPK). 
 
¶3. (C)  COMMENT. Ambassador Struble will speak shortly with 
PPK and ask whether he is angling for the IDB presidency. 
END COMMENT. 
STRUBLE
