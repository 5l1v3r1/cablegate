RELATIONSHIP 
 
Classified By: DCM Peter W. Bodde, for reasons 1.4 (b) & (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY.  In a June 30 meeting with Codel 
Cardin, Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Gilani requested increased 
cooperation with the U.S. on security and economic assistance.  He 
also firmly asserted that Pakistan's nuclear assets are protected and 
expressed hope for greater international focus on Afghanistan and the 
Pakistani border regions.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C) A Congressional delegation composed of Senator Benjamin L. 
Cardin (D-MD), and Representatives Robert Aderholt (R-AL), Mike 
McIntyre (D-NC), Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), and Zach Wamp (R-TN) as well 
as the Deputy Chief of Mission met June 30 with Prime Minister 
Gilani.  Topics covered included:  importance of the bilateral 
relationship, security in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas 
(FATA), and Afghanistan.   The Pakistani government is working on a 
three prong approach in the fight against terrorism, according to 
Gilani.  The first prong involves the political process and engaging 
the tribesmen who renounced violence and can be brought into 
mainstream politics.  The second prong focuses on development: 
Gilani claimed the primary cause of the problems in the border areas 
is the lack of jobs, health care, education and communication with 
the outside world.  The third prong will involve the use of military 
force if necessary. 
 
---------------------- 
Increased Cooperation 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Gilani expressed appreciation for the "bilateral support" from 
the United States.  He noted the perception in the U.S that the GOP 
has engaged in agreements with the militants, but was quick to 
elaborate that the new coalition government has not concluded any 
peace agreements.  Instead, they are concluded by provincial 
governments.  He requested increased cooperation with the U.S. on 
defense, education, health and in establishment of the Reconstruction 
Opportunity Zones (ROZs).  Gilani also sought increased cooperation 
on intelligence efforts and noted that the perception in Pakistan was 
that "we are fighting a war for America and we need to explain this 
is a war for humanity."  Further stating that "the focus of the world 
needs to be on this part of the world," Gilani commented that the 
foreign fighters in Pakistan are "doing mischief in Afghanistan and 
here."  Noting that the foreign fighters find a haven in Pakistan 
because of the poverty and lack of education, Gilani requested 
assistance in finding a "permanent solution." 
 
------------ 
Afghanistan 
------------ 
 
¶4. (C) Gilani noted that three million Afghan refugees are living in 
Pakistan.  Stability must be established in Afghanistan so these 
refugees can go home.  Noting that Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood 
Qureshi had recently traveled to Paris for the Afghan donor 
conference, Gilani expressed hope that the jirga process could help 
establish cross border stability.  He also commented that Pakistan 
hopes to build a fence and implement a biometric system to track 
border movements, but needs a mutually agreed strategy with 
Afghanistan to do so.   Responding to Senator Cardin's question on 
whether Pakistan had the measures necessary to deal with border 
security issues, Gilani noted that the refugees should go back to 
Afghanistan; however, without economic development to address the 
"root causes" of instability, this will not be possible. 
 
¶5. (C) Responding to Rep. Sanchez's question about what the U.S. 
needs to do to get Afghanistan "back on track," Gilani replied that 
U.S. should simply "stay the course."  Further stating that there is 
a perception that the U.S. will leave prematurely and that it was 
imperative to "see what you have started through to conclusion." 
Senator Cardin noted that he feels strongly that "we need to deal 
with the problems in Afghanistan and must work together to build on 
the progress already made." 
 
--------------------- 
Economy and Security 
--------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Cardin noted that economic stability in Pakistan is critical 
for the regional stability, adding that eventually the U.S. would 
like to see the money spent on terrorism shifted to economic growth 
and helping the Pakistani people.  Rep. Wamp noted that the "U.S. 
can't work out your political and judicial issues but we can help 
 
ISLAMABAD 00002303  002 OF 002 
 
 
with the economy and security because [Pakistan] is the linchpin for 
the whole region."  Further stating that this is "a critical moment 
in the history of the world, specifically relating to Pakistan," Wamp 
noted his friendship with Benazir Bhutto and invited Gilani to 
regularly participate in the National Prayer Breakfast as she had 
done each year.  Responding to Rep. Aderholt's question regarding the 
coalition's priorities, Gilani noted that Pakistan's priority now is 
first to fight against terrorism and second to build the economy. 
He further elaborated that whenever there is a bombing in the 
country, Pakistan looses foreign investors. U.S. assistance is needed 
"for a strategic fight to save the economy." 
 
---------------- 
Nuclear Security 
---------------- 
 
¶7. (C) Gilani responded emphatically to Rep. McIntrye's question 
about nuclear security and stated that he wanted to "dispel any image 
of perceived problems."  He further elaborated, "We have control of 
the resources.  These are not controlled by any one person and the 
political party process does not have any impact on nuclear 
security." 
 
¶8.  (U) Codel Cardin did not clear on this message.
