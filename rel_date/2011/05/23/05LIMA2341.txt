Poloff spoke with Vicente Rojas, the Foreign Ministry's 
Director of Special Affairs on 5/23, regarding the U.S. 
position on the ILO's proposed budget for FY 2005-2006 
(Reftel).  Rojas said that the matter was under study, but 
that Peru, for financial reasons, was almost certain to 
support the U.S. call for restraint in the ILO budget.
