REF: STATE 126870

¶1. (SBU) Ambassador delivered reftel demarche on 7/13 to 
Foreign Minister Manuel Rodriguez.  Ambassador stressed that 
it would be counterproductive to call for a vote now on the 
G-4 resolution on Security Council (UNSC) expansion -- the 
resolution is contrary to the interests of many important 
countries who want to have a role in an expanded Council, and 
greater progress is needed on overall UN reform before we 
focus on the specific issue of the Security Council. 
 
¶2. (C) Rodriguez said that Peru also wants to avoid having 
this issue come to a vote and he would instruct his UN 
Mission to work closely with the U.S. toward that end.  If a 
vote is held, the Foreign Minister said, it would present a 
very complex issue for the GOP.  Peru has made bilateral 
commitments to support permanent seats for Brazil, India, 
Germany and South Africa.  Especially because of the 
importance of Brazil to Peru's interests, a call for a vote 
on these countries would put great pressure on the GOP to 
vote yes.  Japan as a permanent member is presently a 
delicate issue for Peru.  In the abstract, the GOP recognizes 
the importance of Japan on the world scene, but as long as 
former President Fujimori is exiled there, Peru cannot come 
out in favor of a permanent Japanese seat.  If the G-4 
resolution were to come to a vote, Rodriguez concluded, 
Peru's options would be either to come out in favor or to 
abstain, in either case providing an explanation of the vote. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Rodriguez wanted to pursue a nuanced approach.  He 
said it was important to maintain the equities and balance of 
interests of the post-war era represented in the Security 
Council.  UNSC expansion should make the Council more 
realistic in representation, but also more effective in 
accomplishing its role.  Four new countries with veto powers 
would be unworkable.  Peru wanted to see more non-permanent 
members, but finds the African proposal with five new members 
from their region to be unrealistic.  Peru would favor a more 
conservative approach -- there ought to be new Council 
members, perhaps using a mix of two and four year terms, but 
the Council should not become huge and unwieldy, which could 
just lead to more vetoes.
