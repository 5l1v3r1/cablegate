SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR A U.S. SPEAKER ON CULTURAL PROPERTY AND 
TRAFFICKING 
 
REF:  SANTIAGO 001508 
 
¶1.   Program description: In January 2002, a colonial altarpiece 
was stolen from Challapampa, Puno, a city on the banks of Lake 
Titicaca in the highlands of southern Peru.  Thanks to law 
enforcement efforts by the FBI and DHS and to the legal framework 
provided by the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation 
and the Memorandum of Understanding on Cultural Patrimony 
Protection, the altar was recovered and will soon be repatriated. 
Post would like to second Santiago's request (see REFTEL), in 
order to reinforce the impact of this repatriation and to help 
raise awareness on the severe damages caused by trafficking and 
smuggling of cultural patrimony. 
 
¶2.   Time frame:  November 26 - December 3.  FY06 1Q; (2 travel 
days, 5 working days, and 1 optional day for tourism.) 
 
¶3.   Program Objectives: 
--Reduce patrimony related crimes, 
--Recognize trafficking of cultural patrimony as an advanced 
organized form of international crime, 
--Raise awareness on the losses and consequences of trafficking 
of cultural patrimony, 
--Provide preventive legal instruments to avoid future crimes. 
 
¶4.   MPP goal: Disruption of Criminal Organizations.  This 
program strongly supports the MOU on Cultural Patrimony 
protection, signed between the governments of Peru and the U.S. 
in 1997 and renewed until 2007. 
 
¶5.   Justification: This program strengthens the Embassy's role 
in the recovery of the Challapampa altarpiece and contributes to 
a wider and broader dissemination of its repatriation.  Post will 
work in close coordination with the Peruvian National Institute 
of Culture to help raise awareness on the negative consequences 
of cultural trafficking, and the importance of protecting and 
conserving patrimony in favor of local and national cultural 
identity. 
 
¶6.   Audience: Participants will include museum staff, 
representatives of the National Institute of Culture, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Police Department, Customs 
officials, community members, and journalists. 
 
¶7.   Proposed topics to be discussed by panelist and type of 
event: 
U.S. speaker would address the legal framework, prosecution 
procedures, preventive methods, inspection and investigation 
techniques, and Internet resources.  It will also raise issues 
related to the shared responsibilities between all cooperating 
institutions, including the National Institute of Culture, the 
Customs Office, the Police Department, and civil society. 
 
Type of event:  Speaker will participate in public conferences 
and one-day workshops in the cities of Puno, Cusco, and Lima. 
Media interviews will also be arranged. 
 
¶8.   Speaker requirement: Post requests by name Dr. Bonnie 
Magness-Gardiner, assigned speaker to Santiago. 
 
¶9.    Supporting materials:  Post would appreciate any materials 
in Spanish materials related to the program to be sent via email 
or fax prior to the program. 
 
¶10.  Funding: FY06 I bucks. 
 
¶11.   Name of Program Officer and contact information: Program 
Officer is ACAO Abigail Gonzalez, office phone (51-1) 618-2634, 
fax 434-1299 or 434-0100. Program coordinator is Vanessa Wagner 
de Reyna, 618-2080. Thanks and regards.
