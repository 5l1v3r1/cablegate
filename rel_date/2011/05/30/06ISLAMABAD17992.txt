SUBJECT: EMBASSY RECOMMENDATION ON ENGAGING GOP ON F-16 SALE 
 
REF: ISLAMABAD 017768 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ryan Crocker. Reasons 1.4  (b) and (d) 

¶1.  (C)  Summary:  Post requests senior officials from SCA, PM, H, and OSD convene Pakistani Ambassador Durrani and reinforce the importance of the September 15 Offer Expiration Date (OED) for signing the F-16 Letter of Acceptance(LOA.) End Summary 

¶2.  (C)  Over the weekend, Ambassador Crocker engaged President Musharraf's Chief of Staff, LTG Hamid Javaid, on the F-16 purchase agreement.  (Note:  The GOP had scheduled the LOA signing for September 9 but then last week canceled the ceremony and issued a set of new demands, detailed reftel.)  The Ambassador stressed that the Offer Expiration Date was September 15 and that the GOP must understand there was no flexibility with that deadline.  It was too late to be presenting new demands; missing the September 15 date would create potentially serious ramifications for the entire F-16 package agreement. 

¶3.  (C)  Post believes it would be beneficial for senior officals from SCA, PM, H, and OSD to convene Ambassador Durrani and reiterate the points Ambassador Crocker made over the weekend.  Following are those points:  
--  It is too late to try to renegotiate the Letter of Acceptance.  September 15 is a hard deadline.  (Note:  While we have heard the Defense Secrutiy Cooperation Agency might be able to extend the date to September 30, we most certainly are not/not mentioning that to GOP officials.  End Note.)  
--  Missing the deadline could have serious ramifications, both on this F-16 sale and on future defense purchases.  
--  Lockheed Martin has offered you the best price possible. The offer of that price expires September 15.  Do not think there is a better deal out there if the offer expires.  
--  Because of production issues, missing the deadline could result in hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs to you.  
--  It is simply too late to be discussing off-sets or financing issues.  
--  It is inappropriate to be making demands unrelated to the LOA.  
--  The USG has been consistent in its position that Pakistan must have adequate national funding up front for the sale to proceed.  
--  After the agreement is signed, the USG will continue to assist Pakistan on issues regarding the F-16 program.
