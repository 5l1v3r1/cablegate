¶1.  In a press release issued on June 10, Peru's Foreign 
Ministry announced that Peruvian FM Rodriguez and Chilean FM 
Walker had decided to convene a meeting on July 6 of the "2 
plus 2" mechanism, the consultative group made up of the 
Foreign and Defense Ministers of the two countries.  This 
step had been agreed to previously in the Joint Declaration 
(text furnished in reftel) signed by the Foreign Ministers on 
May 22 with reference to the controversy over Chilean arms 
sales to Ecuador during the 1995 Peru-Ecuador border 
conflict.  Scheduling a date for the "2 plus 2" meeting is a 
further indication of the desire of the GOP and the GOC to 
return their relations to a more normal footing.
