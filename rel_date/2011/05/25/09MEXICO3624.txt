SUBJECT: PRI SENATE LEADER PLEDGES COOPERATION WITH 
AMBASSADOR ON BILATERAL ISSUES  
REF: MEXICO 3596 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Carlos Pascual for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  The Ambassador met with Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI) Senator Manlio Beltrones December 
18 to discuss bilateral coordination efforts, the Merida 
Initiative, military deployment in the northern part of the 
country, and President Calderon's political reform proposals 
(reftel).  They also discussed the recent law enforcement 
operation in which the head of the Beltran Leyva drug 
trafficking organization was killed. The Ambassador suggested 
that joint hearings be held on the question of Mexico's 
security challenges in the north and urged that cooperation 
on the Merida Initiative not be tied to the National Action 
Party (PAN).  The Ambassador also requested that Beltrones 
work closely with PAN Senator Gustavo Madero before the next 
U.S.-Mexico Policy Coordination Group meeting between the two 
countries in late January.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) The Ambassador met with Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI) Senator Manlio Fabio Beltrones for breakfast on 
December 18 to discuss a number of bilateral issues between 
the U.S. and Mexico.  The Ambassador briefed Beltrones on a 
full range of USG efforts including bilateral interagency 
coordination, recent senior visits, and details of USG 
support for the operation against Arturo Beltran Leyva on 
December 16 in the state of Morelos, the latter of which 
Beltrones understood was confidential and not for public 
disclosure.  Beltrones said that the President of the 
National Human Rights Commission (CNDH), Raul Plascencia, had 
complained to him about graphic photos in the press depicting 
Beltran Leyva's death. 
 
¶3. (C) Beltrones, who is the PRI's Senate coordinator, was 
pleased by the level of interagency cooperation on both sides 
and agreed with the Ambassador on the need to find a way to 
institutionalize it so that it does not disappear with a 
change of administration or leadership.  He said that the new 
mechanisms for cooperation were an excellent way to 
instutionalize dialogue.  Upon the Ambassador's request, he 
agreed to coordinate with National Action Party (PAN) Senator 
Gustavo Madero to arrange a meeting with key Senate figures 
and committees before the next U.S.-Mexico Policy 
Coordination Group meeting in January. 
 
¶4. (C) Beltrones noted that National Defense Minister 
Guillermo Galvan Galvan personally asked him for more legal 
authority to operate in the northern part of the country and 
for more troops and resources.  Beltrones indicated to the 
Ambassador discomfort with the nature of the request.  The 
Ambassador suggested that he work with the Calderon 
Administration to conduct joint hearings that would allow 
discussion of various means by which to address the issue 
with all the relevant actors in a way that would not leave 
the army feeling isolated.  The Ambassador also stressed that 
it was essential that cooperation on the Merida Initiative 
not be tied to the ruling PAN, making it a target for attacks 
by the PRI or other political players.  Beltrones said he 
agreed, and that he would explore ways to improve bilateral 
cooperation on law enforcement matters. 
 
¶5. (C) On Calderon's political reform initiative (reftel), 
Beltrones agreed on the need for greater predictability when 
it comes to policy processes and more accountability of 
elected officials, signaling support for proposals that would 
allow for the reelection of congressional representatives and 
reduce the number of congressional members overall.  He 
opined that Congress should have the power to confirm cabinet 
officials and suggested staggering presidential and 
congressional elections.  He advocated regulatory reform that 
would strengthen institutions over individual political 
leaders.  Finally, Beltrones emphasized the importance of 
adopting a new tax code and other fiscal reform, without 
which Mexico's fiscal stability would founder.  Beltrones 
promised to work on these measures and get back to the 
Ambassador in January. 
 
¶6. (C) Comment:  The Ambassador's meeting with Senator Manlio 
Beltrones, one of the leading PRI politicians in Mexico, 
underscores the importance that his party places on 
maintaining a close relationship with the USG.  In response 
to the Ambassador's requests, Beltrones indicated a 
willingness to cooperate with the PRI's primary political 
rival, the PAN, on a number of issues, including the Merida 
 
MEXICO 00003624  002 OF 002 
 
 
Initiative, rationalizing military deployments, and bilateral 
coordination.  In the aftermath of its success in the midterm 
elections in July as the leading political force in Mexico, 
the PRI seeks to project the image that it is prepared to 
cooperate constructively, both with its political rivals, 
including the current administration, and with the U.S., 
provided such cooperation is viewed as beneficial to the 
country.  End Comment.
