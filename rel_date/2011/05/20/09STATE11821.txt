SUBJECT: AF ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY CALL TO MALI
PRESIDENT RE CANADIAN HOSTAGES
Classified By: Acting A/S Phil Carter for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
¶1. (C) Summary: Two Canadian nationals, United Nations
Special Envoy Robert Fowler and Special Assistant Louis Guay,
and Nigerien national Soumaina Mounkaila are currently being
held in northern Mali by Al Qaida in the Lands of the Islamic
Maghreb (AQIM). In response to a February 2 Canadian
demarche, AF Acting Assistant Secretary Phillip Carter called
Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure on February 9 to
encourage him to continue Mali's cooperation with the United
Nations (UN) and Canada in their efforts to rescue the three
hostages and urge him to make resolution of this case a
priority for the GOM.
¶2. (C) Carter asked for Toure's perspectives on the urgent
situation with the Canadian hostages, including Ambassador
Fowler. Carter stressed its importance to the UN, Canadians,
and United States, saying that these three men were important
to UN work on the Sahel, and that if this situation
continues, it will hurt Mali's image for private investment.
Toure said they were in constant contact and coordinating
with the Canadians, and that the hostages were in good
health. Carter noted concern that the situation had become
complicated with the kidnapping of a second group of
Europeans: the Canadian government had a policy of not paying
ransom which may differ from the European approach. Toure
assured him the two groups were being treated separately and
Mali would act with the consent of the Canadian government.
When Carter asked what the United States can do, Toure
responded that they need information, especially on the
location of the hostages, who are frequently moved around
Mali and its bordering countries.
¶3. (C) Later in the day, Acting AF/W Director met with the
Canadian POLCON. He reported the conversation and relayed
Toure's request for information, particularly on the location
of the hostages.
¶4. (U) Acting A/S Phillip Carter has cleared on this cable.
