SUBJECT: VISAS VIPER: REVOCATION OF VISA OF XXXXXXXXXXXX DUE 
TO POTENTIAL TERRORIST ACTIVITIES 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Terry Breese, Deputy Chief of Mission, State 
Department, U.S. Embassy, Ottawa; REASON: 1.4(B), (C), (D) 
 
¶1.            (S/NF)  BEGIN SUMMARY  Based on information received 
from GRPO, Post nominates XXXXXXXXXXXX, a Turkish citizen 
who is a permanent resident of Canada, for inclusion in the Visas 
Viper program.  XXXXXXXXXXXX is being nominated because of his 
association with Hiva ALIZADEH, a Canadian citizen born in Iran who 
is strongly suspected of posing an imminent terrorist threat.  Due 
the immediacy of the potential threat, Post has revoked XXXXXXXXXXXX 
visa under section 214(b) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act 
and has entered a "P3B" hit in CLASS for him.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
 
¶2.            (SBU)  XXXXXXXXXXXX (DOB XXXXXXXXXXXX) is a Turkish 
citizen, born in Turkey, who came to Canada in XXXXXXXXXXXX and became a 
Canadian resident in XXXXXXXXXXXX.  He is married to XXXXXXXXXXXX 
(DOB XXXXXXXXXXXX).  He operates a XXXXXXXXXXXX 
called XXXXXXXXXXXX.  He is the holder of 
Turkish Passport XXXXXXXXXXXX.  He resides at XXXXXXXXXXXX, 
XXXXXXXXXXXX.  His home telephone number is XXXXXXXXXXXX, his 
work telephone number is XXXXXXXXXXXX, and his cell phone number is 
XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
 
 
 
¶3.            (SBU)  On XXXXXXXXXXXX 2010, Post issued XXXXXXXXXXXXX a 
B1/B2 visa, with an expiration date of XXXXXXXXXXXX.  At the 
time, no derogatory information concerning XXXXXXXXXXXX existed in the 
CLASS system. 
 
 
 
¶4.            (S/NF)  According to information provided by GRPO, 
between January XXXXXXXXXXXX 2010, XXXXXXXXXXXX went on a trip with Hiva 
ALIZADEH (DOB XXXXXXXXXXXX), a Canadian citizen born in Iran.  GRPO 
states that ALIZADEH is involved in the planning of terrorist 
activities in North America and poses an imminent threat.  (Note: 
Post conducted a CLASS check of ALIZADEH and found that he was the 
subject of a "00" CLASS entry.  End note).  GRPO noted that prior 
to his association with ALIZADEH, they had not received any 
previous derogatory information concerning XXXXXXXXXXXX.  GRPO requested 
that XXXXXXXXXXXX’s visa be revoked immediately because of his ties with 
ALIZADEH. 
 
 
 
¶5.            (SBU)  Post conducted a check of XXXXXXXXXXXX in CCD and 
CLASS.  In addition to entries related to the visa issued on 
XXXXXXXXXXXX 2010, the CCD stated that XXXXXXXXXXXX had applied for a 
B1/B2 visa three times in Istanbul.  Istanbul denied his 
application on XXXXXXXXXXXX 2000 under Section 214(b) of the INA, 
but granted him visas on XXXXXXXXXXXX  (expiration date XXXXXXXXXXXX )
 and XXXXXXXXXXXX  (expiration date XXXXXXXXXXXX ). 
Post did not find any relevant entries in CLASS related to XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
 
 
 
¶5.            (S/NF)  Due to the urgency of the request, pursuant 
to 9 FAM 41.122 N 4.3, Post's consular section revoked XXXXXXXXXXXX 's 
visa in the NIV system under Section 214(b) of the INA and, 
pursuant to 9 FAM 40.37 N11.1, entered a "P3B" hit for XXXXXXXXXXXX into 
CLASS.  Due to ongoing investigations, Post did not contact XXXXXXXXXXXX 
to inform him that his visa had been revoked, and thus the visa was 
not physically canceled.  The consular section also asked Post's 
CBP attachC) to put an alert in DHS's lookout systems as an 
additional safeguard against XXXXXXXXXXXX entering the U.S.
