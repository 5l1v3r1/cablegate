On November 10, twenty-one police officers in Tijuana (nineteen 
municipal and two state police assigned to TJ), including at 
least two commanders and Consulate Tijuana's liaison official, 
were detained by military personnel in a federal operation 
coordinated by the Federal Attorney General's Office (PGR) and 
sent to Mexico City for possible prosecution for suspected links 
to organized crime.  State and local authorities appeared 
surprised, but not disappointed, by the detentions, with at 
least one insisting this gave them an opportunity for a clean 
start.  Daniel de la Rosa, the State Secretary for Public 
Security, compared these detentions with the dismissals this 
year of about 100 police officers statewide as a result of the 
state and municipal purging processes under the Acuerdo Nacional 
de Seguridad Publica (National Public Security Agreement - ref 
A).   This is the first time in several years in Baja, however, 
that federal authorities have detained local authorities for 
links to organized crime. 
 
On November 14, Alberto Capella, the Tijuana Municipal Secretary 
of Public Security, told WHA Deputy Assistant Secretary Roberta 
Jacobson, coincidentally on a visit to Tijuana, that, unlike in 
previous purges, none of these twenty-one officers will be 
reinstated, even if federal authorities decide not to press 
charges.   Tijuana Mayor Jorge Ramos has publicly insisted these 
officers will not be restored to their positions, whether or not 
there is proof of their illicit activities.   This is 
significant because at least one of those detained, Post's 
liaison officer, is a close friend of the Mayor's.   One of the 
Mayor's assistants told Post that new legislation makes it 
easier for the government to sack police officials.  (NOTE: Post 
believes this official was referring to changes made at the 
federal level in 2008 to Article 123, art B XIII of the 
Constitution which, in theory, will allow the government to 
dismiss pslice officers without the possibility of 
reinstatement, allowing only the possibilty of financial 
compensation if a judge finds that a policeman was dismissed 
without cause.  END NOTE).  Still, many doubt whether local 
authorities will be able to keep the police officials out of 
their jobs once the officers begin legal processes and obtain 
"amparos" (injunctions) against their dismissals, as the 
constitutional changes are untested in Baja.   One prominent 
lawyer told DAS Jacobson and poloff that the way the detentions 
and dismissals were handled - by military officials and without 
solid proof - calls into question the rule of law and order just 
at the time that Mexico is trying to improve its judicial 
system. 
 
Whatever the fate of the twenty-one officers, the detentions 
appear to be spurring other shakeups in the local law 
enforcement community.   Tijuana's police chief is rumored to be 
leaving for a state-level job, and Rosarito's current chief is 
supposedly heading to Tijuana.    Some say Capella, who had no 
law enforcement background before being appointed to his 
position and does not command the respect of his subordinates, 
has submitted his resignation, though he gave no indication of 
this in his November 14 meeting with Post. 
 
COMMENT:  The latest purges may show the federal government's 
resolve to rid local police forces of corruption, and local 
politicians either support the federal efforts or have no choice 
but to appear to be supportive, but while Baja California 
continues to be territory disputed by the remnants of the 
Arellano Felix Organization drug cartel and the Sinaloa cartel, 
violence is likely to continue in the area.
