CLASSIFIED BY: Lloyd W. Moss, Pol-Econ Counselor, State, Kingston; 
REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1.      (SBU)  On February 8,  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Foreign Trade (MFAFT) Permanent Secretary (PS) Amb. Evadne Coye 
advised Charge that Prime Minister (PM) Bruce Golding wanted to 
meet with him the following day in the PM's Office.   The PS 
advised that she was not aware of the subject of the meeting. 
 
 
 
¶2.      (C)  PM Golding began the conversation by expressing his 
understanding that the U.S. Treasury reps had taken a "very hard 
line" in their review of the Government of Jamaica (GOJ)'s recent 
IMF loan application by insisting on strict adherence to all of the 
terms of the loan.  He asked if this "hard line" stance was related 
to the GOJ's inaction on the Coke extradition matter (reftels). 
The Charge' responded that, while resolution of Coke extradition 
matter was of great importance to the USG and we hoped for an 
affirmative response soon, the request had no impact on the U.S. 
loan vote, and pointed out that it is reasonable to expect that all 
nations abide by terms of their IMF loan agreements.  The PM 
concluded by reiterating his government's intention to comply fully 
with the terms of the loan. 
 
 
 
¶3.      (SBU)  The PM stated that he recently had discussed the 
Coke extradition matter with Solicitor General (SG) Douglas Leys 
and understood that the USG had not followed through on commitments 
made during the December meetings between USG and GOJ officials in 
Washington to provide additional information.  He noted that the 
Attorney General (AG) Dorothy Lightbourne is prepared to rule on 
the extradition request, but wanted to give the USG every 
opportunity to provide information on its authority to use the 
Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) and wiretap information during 
U.S. grand jury proceedings.  ((Comment:  During Charge's meeting 
with SG Leys and AG Lightbourne last week (reftel A), SG Leys 
stated that the AG had every right to deny the request due to her 
conclusion that the U.S. had no authority to use the wiretap 
information and JCF testimony without prior consent from the GOJ, 
but wanted to give the USG every opportunity to provide the 
justification requested.  End Comment.)) 
 
 
 
Action Request 
 
 
 
¶4.      (C)  Post requests that Department move forward with 
diplomatic note addressing the GOJ's concerns regarding use of 
wiretap information using talking points outlined in 
McDonough/Parnell e-mail of February 3.  Charge has raised the 
matter of disclosure of the 2004 MOU between UK/GOJ/DEA with UK 
High Commissioner, and expects to get UK's views of MOU disclosure 
on February 10.
