SUBJECT: PRI PRESIDENT OPTIMISTIC FOR PARTY'S FUTURE 
 Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Charles V. Barclay. 
Reason: 1.4 (b), (d). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary. CDA met with PRI President Beatriz Paredes 
for an April 24 breakfast.  Discussion ranged from President 
Obama's recent visit to the PRI's prospects in the July 
legislative elections.  Overall, Paredes was optimistic about 
the party's chances in the upcoming votes, as well as the 
2012 presidential contest.  She also implied that relations 
with the PAN will worsen, including in the next Congressional 
term, should PAN continue its electoral strategy of heavily 
criticizing and accusing the PRI of being tied to drug 
trafficking.  End Summary 
 
Pleased With President Obama's Visit 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (C) CDA opened the April 24 breakfast meeting with 
Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) President Beatriz 
Paredes by soliciting her take on the April 16-17 visit from 
President Obama.  Paredes replied that she thought that the 
visit had gone very well, and admitted that she is a biased 
observer as she is a "fan" of the President.  She thought it 
was important the President had the opportunity to see for 
himself -- albeit on a short trip -- the realities of Mexico 
and to better understand its security challenges from an 
on-the-ground perspective. 
 
¶3. (C) Several other bilateral issues were raised during the 
course of the breakfast, including the question of arms 
trafficking across the border and delays in disbursing Merida 
Initiative funds.  The conversation was cordial with Paredes 
appearing to appreciate domestic U.S. sensitivities in 
treating the gun control issue.  CDA explained why Merida 
implementation had been slow in some cases -- including a 
change in the U.S. administration and a multi-faceted 
negotiation process oftentimes involving several Mexican 
government agencies.  She also noted where programs were 
already well underway. 
 
July Legislative Elections 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Paredes noted that the PRI is positioned going into 
the July Chamber of Deputies elections to become the largest 
party in the lower house and could even snag an absolute 
majority.  Paredes pointed to the party's success in local 
elections over the past two years as indicative that the PRI 
still maintains a large core of loyal supporters throughout 
Mexico, which will undoubtedly benefit the party in July. 
Paredes argued that the PRI's 2006 presidential electoral 
debacle was the result of a bad candidate rather than an 
outright rejection of the party by voters.  She also said 
that the PRI's weakness in Mexico City tends to give the 
impression that the party is more fragile nationwide than it 
really is.  The party president said that the PRI will 
certainly pursue its own program and will drive initiatives 
in Congress, particularly should it win an absolute majority, 
but offered no specifics on the kinds of proposals it planned 
to make. 
 
¶5. (C) As a plurinominal candidate for a federal deputy seat, 
Paredes is virtually guaranteed a seat based on her high 
ranking on the party's candidate list.  Nevertheless, she 
said she was content as PRI president and had not wanted to 
pursue the position.  Instead, she noted that her entrance 
into the Chamber was part of a broader party strategy to put 
its key leaders in Congress.  She claimed she has no plans to 
be the leader of the PRI legislative bloc, but would 
reconsider depending on the needs of the party. 
 
PRI vs. PAN 
----------- 
 
¶6. (C) Paredes was unequivocal in her criticism of the PRI's 
primary rival, the National Action Party (PAN), maintaining 
it had proven unable to grow out of its role as an opposition 
party and into a real leadership position.  She said that the 
PRI would have been far more effective than the PAN has been 
in treating the security program without offering how the PRI 
would have governed differently.  She also argued that the 
PAN is mistaken in its present electoral strategy of 
 
MEXICO 00001202  002 OF 002 
 
 
intensified criticism of the PRI and accusations that it is a 
party marred by ties to narcotics trafficking.  The PRI has 
supported the PAN on 95 percent of its initiatives in 
Congress, including major legislation such as pension reform, 
judicial reform, and an energy reform 'lite.'  She described 
the PAN's acrimonious approach to its major congressional 
partner as very risky.  Paredes implied that relations 
between the two parties -- including in Congress -- will 
become increasingly rancorous next session should the PAN 
continue with the negative campaigning.  PAN would be better 
off to "focus less on polls and more on politics." 
 
Presidential Politicking 
------------------------ 
 
¶7. (C) Paredes declined to discuss in detail the PRI,s 
election process or plans for the 2012 presidential election. 
 The elections are three years out, she explained, and the 
party still needs to focus on the six gubernatorial votes in 
¶2010.  Nevertheless, she indicated that Mexico State Governor 
Enrique Pena Nieto would be the strongest candidate, 
particularly if he successfully stewards PRI victory in his 
state,s 2011 gubernatorial elections.  (Note: There is 
probably little risk of a non-PRI candidate capturing the 
governorship.  The PRI has ruled Mexico State for decades.) 
Paredes revealed little about her own rumored presidential 
ambitions, claiming that she is working to ensure that the 
PRI wins the presidency rather than working to capture the 
slot herself.  She clearly believes that the PRI has a very 
good shot at winning the 2012 contest.
