RESULTS OF APRIL 26 COM VIDEO CONFERENCE

REF: A. KUWAIT 1421
¶B. KUWAIT 913

Classified By: Ambassador Richard LeBaron for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)

¶1. (S REL AUS UK) Summary: Chiefs of Mission from Kuwait,
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria conferred via video
conference on April 26 to follow up on Regional Strategy
Initiative (RSI) proposals first formulated at a March 7-8
counterterrorism (CT) strategy session in Kuwait (Ref A) to
counter foreign fighters entering and leaving Iraq.
Coordinator for Counterterrorism Ambassador Henry Crumpton
and interagency representatives participated from Washington
and other sites. Embassy Baghdad and Embassy Ankara were not
able to participate due to visits of Secretaries Rice and
Rumsfeld. JSOC Commander briefed on the DoD foreign fighter
strategy and endorsed the RSI. COMs recommended interagency
support for the following proposals:

-- A regional biometrics meeting of U.S. and foreign
counterparts to coordinate policies on biometrics to be held
in Jordan, with S/CT identifying funding and DOJ and DHS
coordinating on agenda and content.

-- The S/CT request for the establishment of CT specialist
positions in the geographic bureaus and S/CT support for the
Regional Strategy Initiative.

-- PM exploration of options for staffing Joint Interagency
Task Forces (JIATF) to facilitate State-DoD CT coordination.
JSOC has invited S/CT and PM to visit JIATF West in Iraq.

-- Use of existing mechanisms such as the Arab League and
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for regular engagement and
consultations with regional partners on CT issues.

-- Directing more CT training at mid-level Ministry of
Interior officials, in multi-country group programs to build
cross-border professional relationships.

-- Embassy consultation with host governments about their
willingness to participate in future regional training
programs, at the Jordan International Police Training Center
(JIPTC) in Amman. Embassy Riyadh will solicit Saudi
financial support for JIPTC renovation as INL finalizes a
strategy for JIPTC use and funding.

-- Embassy recommendations to NEA and S/CT on what additional
information-sharing by Embassy Baghdad would enhance regional
CT efforts.

-- Embassy coordination with ECA on detailed requests with
ECA for expanded exchange and scholarship programs to promote
religious tolerance.

-- S/CT engagement with DS, EB, and USAID on including CT
issues in private sector outreach.

Agreed actions are shown in paras 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,
18, 20. End Summary.

Regional Biometrics And Forensics Conference
--------------------------------------------

KUWAIT 00001675 002 OF 005

¶3. (S REL AUS UK) Embassy Amman reported that King Abdullah
would be pleased to have Jordan host a regional conference on
biometrics, with the intelligence directorate taking the
lead. COMs agreed that the meeting should have a relatively
low profile, with sub-ministerial participants. They
committed to contacting their host governments to seek
advance agreement on three conference objectives and report
the findings to Embassy Amman:

-- Obtain a political commitment by participating governments
to share biometrics data on a case-by-case basis. More
automatic data sharing can be addressed at a later time.

-- Appoint senior points of contact in each government on
biometrics and information-sharing issues.

-- Consider integrating the U.S. IAFES automated fingerprint
system into any agreed biometrics collection and sharing
mechanism, and seek compatibility with the FBI's ongoing
Global Fingerprint Initiative. Conferees noted the
importance of intragovernment cooperation and system
compatibility for any biometrics program.

COMs acknowledged other related initiatives at DOJ and the
need for close U.S. interagency cooperation on conference
preparations. They agreed that Arab governments should lead
the process as much as possible to keep the focus on
developing partner nation capacity. There was also
discussion of whether it would be appropriate for Syria to
participate in the effort.

¶4. (S REL AUS UK) Action: Embassies will discuss a potential
biometrics conference with host governments, and seek advance
agreement on conference objectives and share host country
views with Embassy Amman; the Government of Jordan will
likely host. S/CT will identify funding resources. S/CT
will work with DOJ and other relevant agencies to ensure the
conference complements, and is compatible with, existing
standards and initiatives. NEA and S/CT will formulate a
policy decision on Syrian participation. Embassy Amman will
seek Government of Jordan views on inviting Syria to the
conference.

Saudi Arabia as a Regional CT Focus
-----------------------------------

¶5. (S REL AUS UK) Embassy Riyadh assessed that Saudi
regional leadership on CT issues is constrained by the
situation in Iraq and Syria; improving bilateral cooperation
in a regional context is a more realistic goal. The Saudis
have a six-country initiative with the Gulf States that might
serve as a useful regional mechanism, however. The Saudi
government still sees its planned CT center as international,
despite U.S. recommendations for a regional focus. Embassy
Kuwait asked Embassy Riyadh to encourage the Saudi government
to share with the Kuwaiti government the success of
U.S.-Saudi CT cooperation, particularly on terrorist
financing and regulation of charities issues.

¶6. (S REL AUS UK) Actions: Embassy Riyadh will quietly urge
Saudi Arabia to enhance bilateral CT cooperation with
regional partners and encourage inclusion of CT issues in the

KUWAIT 00001675 003 OF 005

Saudi six-country initiative, with a focus on cash couriers.
Embassy Riyadh, NEA, and S/CT will formulate renewed
approaches to the Saudis on a regional focus for their CT
center.

RSI and Specialist CT Officers
------------------------------

¶7. (S REL AUS UK) S/CT briefed on the broader Regional
Strategy Initiative (RSI), with the regional CT conferences
in Jakarta and Kuwait to be followed by a Horn of Africa
conference in May, an Eastern Mediterranean conference in
June, and South Asia and North/South Mediterranean
conferences planned for later in 2006. S/CT is seeking
several new specialized CT positions to place in different
regions, beginning in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and
Africa. FSI has developed a CT curriculum for use with
entry-level, mid-level, and senior-level officers.

¶8. (S REL AUS UK) Actions: S/CT will work with relevant
bureaus and the interagency on preparations for regional
conferences. S/CT will consult with relevant posts and
bureaus on placement of new CT specialist positions.
Embassies will identify candidates for CT training at FSI.

State Representation on JIACG/JIATF
-----------------------------------

¶9. (S REL AUS UK) JSOC advocated State representation on
JIATF East and JIATF West to enhance State-DoD CT
coordination. PM and S/CT stressed their support for the
concept. PM is exploring options for appropriate staffing of
JIATFs. JSOC invited PM and S/CT to visit JIATF West in Iraq
to see its operation.

¶10. (S REL AUS UK) Actions: PM and DoD will seek agreement
on appropriate State Department staffing of JIATFs.

Regional Information Sharing
----------------------------

¶11. (S REL AUS UK) COMs had in Kuwait requested greater
sharing of CT-related information between Embassy Baghdad and
other posts in the region. Discussion at this meeting was
constrained by the absence of Embassy Baghdad. S/CT asked
Embassies to consider what information from Baghdad and
Washington would aid their efforts to disrupt foreign fighter
networks.

¶12. (S REL AUS UK) Actions: Embassies will advise NEA and
S/CT what information they want from Baghdad and Washington
to aid their CT efforts.

Regional CT Partnerships
------------------------

¶13. (S REL AUS UK) COMs agreed on regional partnership
initiatives proposed by Embassy Kuwait (Ref B):

-- Regularly consult with Arab League member Interior
Ministers before Arab League meetings to influence League
discussion of CT issues. Similar consultations on other

KUWAIT 00001675 004 OF 005

issues are already held with Arab League member Foreign
Ministers. The same can be done with GCC member Interior
Ministers before GCC meetings.

-- Conduct more multi-country anti-terrorism training
programs, with particular emphasis on mid- to senior-level
GCC member personnel. The chief aim is to promote
professional relationships among regional security services
that can be carried into very senior positions in time.

¶14. (S REL AUS UK) Actions: Embassies will begin meeting with
host country Interior Ministers before Arab League and GCC
meetings, as appropriate. Embassies will recommend specific
names and/or ranks of security service personnel to S/CT for
multi-country anti-terrorism training.

Conversion of JIPTC to Regional CT Training Center
--------------------------------------------- -----

¶15. (S REL AUS UK) INL A/S Patterson is considering possible
uses of the Jordan International Police Training Center
(JIPTC) after it reverts to Jordanian control in December
¶2006. Four programs have been proposed: 1) Jordanian Police
Training Center; 2) Regional Police Training Center; 3)
International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA); and 4) Regional
CT Training Center. The JIPTC facility is large enough that
some or all of these uses could be adopted. Funding for
renovation and maintenance is the biggest outstanding issue
and INL is working on a funding strategy. S/CT is committed
to arranging as much regional CT training as possible at
JIPTC, with early emphasis on Lebanon and GCC members.

¶16. (S REL AUS UK) Actions: Embassies will assess host
country willingness to participate in CT training programs at
JIPTC. Embassy Riyadh will approach Saudi Arabia about
contributing to JIPTC renovation and maintenance costs. INL
will advise on JIPTC future use decision.

Exchanges and Scholarships
--------------------------

¶17. (S REL AUS UK) COMs agreed that International Visitor
(IV) programs and related exchanges and scholarships,
particularly those involving Muslim religious figures,
promote religious tolerance and greatly aid in the war on
terror. COMs recommended that these programs be expanded.
Embassy Kuwait singled out the positive local reception to a
recent speech by Undersecretary Hughes on interfaith
dialogue, and asked that such speeches be quickly translated
into Arabic and disseminated. ECA briefed on plans to
increase IV programs and put more funding into interfaith
dialogue; a decision will soon be made on a new Islamic
Dialogue. ECA asked that Embassies provide more information
on what IV themes they prefer and encouraged more use of the
Voluntary Visitor program. Questions and requests regarding
scholarships should be sent to ECA/A Tom Farrell. Embassy
Damascus asked that ECA work closely with DHS on the problems
faced by Syrian IV participants at U.S. ports of entry. S/CT
proposed that more consideration be given to bringing
together religious scholars in the regions. USAID
highlighted its Muslim Outreach program. NSC advised that
general talking points on engaging with the Muslim community
are being prepared for USG use.

KUWAIT 00001675 005 OF 005

¶18. (S REL AUS UK) Actions: Embassies will provide ECA with
detailed requests for additional exchanges and scholarships.
ECA will discuss the issue of Syrian IV participants with
DHS. Interagency should coordinate on sending a consistent
message to the Muslim community.

Private Sector Engagement
-------------------------

¶19. (S REL AUS UK) COMs agreed that production of a handbook
on how to vet employees in a foreign environment, drawing on
USG and large multinational firm experience, would enhance
the CT dimension of the international business community.
Embassy Kuwait suggested that this could be a topic for
discussion with the Overseas Security Advisory Council
(OSAC). Embassy Riyadh proposed that the Business Executives
for National Security (BENS) organization could be used as a
model for an international version. S/CT noted that EB and
USAID both have expansive private sector outreach initiatives
that could potentially include CT concerns.

¶20. (S REL UK US) Actions: S/CT will engage with DS, BENS,
EB, and USAID on the private sector-CT nexus and then update
COMs and the interagency.
