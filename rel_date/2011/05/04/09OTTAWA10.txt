MILITARY TO MILITARY ASSISTANCE
REF: 08 OTTAWA 1231
Classified By: PolMinCouns Scott Bellard, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
¶1. (C) Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade
(DFAIT) Senior Defense Relations Officer Erwin Sippert told
pol/mil officer on January 7 that Canada hopes the United
States will respond positively and quickly via dipnote to
para 2 request for military-to-military assistance in support
of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games. Canada seeks urgent
U.S. response, Sippert said, due in part to Canada Command's
desire to draw on the requested capabilities in two linked
pre-Olympics exercises, which will run from February 9-13:
Canada Command's Operation Staunch Maple, and the larger,
whole-of-government Operation Silver, run by the Privy
Council Office.

military-to-military assistance in support of providing
security for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games to be held
in Vancouver, British Columbia.
The Department wishes to advise the Embassy that Canada is
making an initial request for the provision of certain urgent
capabilities and products which, it is understood, could be
made available by the United States Department of Defense
National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and/or the
Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The requested
capabilities include:
¶1. NGA capabilities to reinforce the Canadian Forces'
Geospatial Intelligence deployed resources in the Operation
PODIUM are of operations as well as in the Canadian Forces
reach-back team in Ottawa;
¶2. high resolution imagery;
¶3. elevation data;
¶4. solid terrain models;
¶5. motion imagery;
¶6. stereo airfield collection;
¶7. "Harbourview" products; and
¶8. detailed survey products - 3D geospatial tools to provide
orientation and planning support packages.
The 19 June 1951 Agreement Between the Parties to the North
Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of Their Forces would
apply to United States Forces deployed to Canada in response
to this request. Force protection would be provided by the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). United States Forces
and personnel deployed to Canada pursuant to this request
would be transferred to the operation control of Canada
Command. The command and control authorities would be agreed
between United States Forces and Canada Command. (Canada

of the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games to be held in
Vancouver, British Columbia. The two Canadian supporting
military organizations associated with the requested
capabilities are the Canadian Special Operation Forces
Qcapabilities are the Canadian Special Operation Forces
Command and the Chief of Defense Intelligence).
The duration, timing, modalities of transfer of equipment and
personnel and other related logistics elements of this
request would be coordinated directly between Canada Command
and the relevant United States Agencies and Commands. The
military point of contact for this request is Canada Command
Deputy Chief of Staff Plans, Colonel John Backstrom,
