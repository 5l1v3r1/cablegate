¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  After the March 24 announcement (reftel) 
that the U.S. and Bulgaria had reached agreement on text for 
the Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA), Bulgarian officials 
at all levels have come out in support of the agreement. 
Continuing Embassy public diplomacy efforts, combined with 
this official support, has resulted in greatly improved press 
coverage.  We continue to monitor all public statements 
closely to ensure they reflect agreed language.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Bulgarian Officials and Media "On Message"... 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following agreement on text for the Defense 
Cooperation Agreement (DCA) which was announced on March 24 
(reftel), Bulgarian officials at the national, regional, and 
local levels are now speaking out more frequently in favor of 
the agreement.  Since the announcement, there has been a 
noticeable increase in favorable press coverage regarding the 
proposed U.S. presence at Bulgarian military facilities.  In 
a major shift, Trud, the largest circulation Bulgarian daily 
newspaper, has come out in support of the agreement. 
 
¶3. (SBU) As part of the Embassy's ongoing public affairs 
outreach program, the Ambassador met with local officials of 
municipalities located near the Novo Selo Training Area and 
Bezmer Air Base March 6-8 to brief them on the agreement. 
Some of these mayors and regional governors have replayed the 
positive, factual information from these briefings in press 
interviews with national news organizations--sometimes 
virtually verbatim. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a national radio interview March 26, Georgi 
Georgiev, mayor of the municipality of Tundzha, said, "There 
will be no U.S. military bases in Bulgaria."  After taking 
the opportunity to correctly point out that these will be 
joint bases, the mayor went on to highlight the economic 
benefits of the bases while downplaying fears of terrorist 
attacks, pollution, and nuclear weapons. 
 
...While Opponents Beat the Drum 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) On March 22, the ultra-nationalist Ataka party began a 
petition campaign against the agreement with the goal of 
collecting 500,000 signatures and 60 votes in Parliament to 
force a national referendum on the DCA.  Under Bulgarian law, 
national referenda can only be ordered by the President, the 
Council of Ministers, or a vote by one quarter of 
Parliament--60 out 240 votes.  With only 14 seats in 
Parliament and no other parties sympathetic to the referendum 
campaign, Ataka's chances for success are remote.  Ataka 
leader Volen Siderov told Bulgarian television April 4 that a 
copy of the petition would be delivered to the U.S. Embassy 
in Sofia and that "we are drawing up a letter to the U.S. 
Congress to inform them of the real public attitudes 
regarding the deployment of military bases in this country." 
 
¶6. (C) COMMENT.  Now that they have seen the agreed text, 
Bulgarian government and military officials are publicly 
promoting the benefits and dispelling the myths that grew up 
around the agreement.  In the aftermath of Ataka's failure to 
derail the negotiations, its petition campaign is designed as 
much to retain visibility for the party as to scuttle the 
agreement, recognizing that the ruling coalition easily has 
enough votes to approve.  We continue to monitor all public 
statements closely to ensure they reflect agreed language. 
END COMMENT.
