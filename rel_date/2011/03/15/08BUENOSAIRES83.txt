SUBJECT: ARGENTINA'S PRESIDENT ENJOYING A HONEYMOON WITH THE PUBLIC 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  A leading Argentine polling firm (Poliarquia) 
found that President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's (CFK) standing 
rose by five points since she took office December 10, with 56% of 
those polled rating her favorably, despite foreign policy missteps 
in early weeks.  This is far below the exceptional 80% positive 
rating her predecessor Nestor Kirchner enjoyed a month after his 
2003 inauguration, but Poliarquia's analysts believe CFK will keep 
climbing in the months ahead.  The Director of another major polling 
firm, Manuel Mora y Araujo, told the Ambassador that the rise also 
reflects two factors:  1) most Argentines don't pay attention to 
foreign relations; and 2) anti-Americanism still strikes a popular 
chord.  End summary. 
 
------------- 
A good start

¶2. (SBU) Poliarquia conducted its latest national survey from 
January 3 through January 11 in the largest urban centers of 
Argentina, precisely where the President received her lowest support 
in the October 28 elections, which she won with 45% of the vote 
nationwide.  Of those polled, 56% rated CFK favorably, an increase 
of five points since her December 10 inauguration.  Only 25% of the 
respondents rendered a below-average assessment, whereas 12% of the 
population surveyed had a negative impression of her.  CFK's 
negative image decreased six points during her first month in 
office. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Although her predecessor Nestor Kirchner received 80% 
favorable opinions during his first month in power, Poliarquia's 
analysts believe CFK's administration is paying a public relations 
price for being viewed as an extension of her husband's 
administration.  Poliarquia foresees a possible climb in the 
following months, after which she may come to a standstill or begin 
to lose support, a common pattern showed by previous 
administrations. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Ambassador met January 23 with Manuel Mora y Araujo, 
who heads another major polling and consulting firm, as well as 
serving as president of Di Tella University.  He said the poll 
results reinforce the notion that most Argentines don't give high 
priority to foreign policy.  Thus, CFK's 
over-reaction to a court case in Miami and her husband's 
questionable involvement in a Colombian hostage release did not 
really register as negatives for many Argentines.  Indeed, one area 
where sadly many Argentines are quite willing to pay attention is 
with conspiracy theories and criticism of the U.S, he said. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  CFK got off to a bumpy start in her first month 
in office, most notably with the crisis in bilateral relations with 
the United States triggered by her over-reaction to the damaging 
allegations made by Venezuelan agents on trial in Miami.  There were 
some other ugly incidents along the way, such as labor leader Hugo 
Moyano's heavy-handed attempt to bully her, and her husband's 
ill-fated expedition to the Colombian jungle as a ""guarantor"" of 
Hugo Chavez's hyped hostage release.  CFK was also criticized for 
spending half of her first month as president on vacation, holed up 
in her country home in southern Argentina.  Given these 
circumstances, it is surprising that her ratings climbed at all, but 
clearly the urban public is using other measures.
