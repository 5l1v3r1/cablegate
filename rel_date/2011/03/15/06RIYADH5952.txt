SUBJECT: KING ABDULLAH AND PRESIDENT MUBARAK DISCUSS
LEBANON; KING ISSUES STERN STATEMENT

REF: RIYADH 5910

Classified By: Ambassador James C. Oberwetter
for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

¶1. (C) King Abdullah and Egyptian President Mubarak met
July 25 to consult on the Lebanon crisis. Stating that Saudi
Arabia and Egypt hold identical views on the situation in
Lebanon, both leaders called for an immediate cease-fire,
warning that continued Israeli aggression could engulf the
entire region in war. President Mubarak said that Egypt and
Saudi Arabia agreed that an international conference on
Lebanon in Rome July 26 "should reach a clear resolution on
reaching a cease-fire and saving the Lebanese people."

¶2. (C) Following the meeting, King Abdullah issued a royal
statement on state-owned television (reftel) warning that
continued Israeli aggression could produce "dangerous
results." King Abdullah emphasized that until now, Arab
nations have chosen peace as a strategic option, and have
"refused to respond to provocation and the extremist calls
that wage war on peace." He cautioned that "patience cannot
go on forever and that if the Israeli military savagery
continues to kill and destroy, no one can predict what would
happen and if the forbidden takes place, regret would be
useless."

¶3. (C) The King also emphasized his government's efforts to
find a solution, citing diplomacy efforts by Foreign Minister
Prince Saud al-Faisal and National Security Advisor Prince
Bandar bin Sultan, who traveled to Washington, London and
Moscow to convey messages from King Abdullah.

¶4. (C) COMMENT: The King's statement is unusually
forthright. It is of note that the Saudi government (SAG)
has not backed away from its initial statement blaming
Hizballah and, by extension, Iran for starting the violence
in Lebanon. That said, in making this tough new statement,
the King and the SAG now seem to be taking closer note of the
popular mood, which is increasingly negative. Recent
contacts with average Saudis in Riyadh indicate increasing
hostility and anger toward Israel over its perceived
"aggression" in Lebanon and Gaza. The biased coverage of
these events by local satellite television channels is only
increasing such sentiments. Our contacts also report
increased feelings of anger and "hatred" for Westerners in
general and Americans in particular. A source close to the
Royal Court has speculated to us that the King may be worried
about the possibility of demonstrations, especially in the
Eastern Province, should he not be seen to take decisive
action to aid Lebanon. Finally, the same source added that
the King probably wanted to signal that Saudi Arabia, not
Iran, would take the lead in assisting Lebanon in rebuilding
once the current conflict subsides. END COMMENT.
