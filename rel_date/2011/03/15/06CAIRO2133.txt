SUBJECT: ARAB LEAGUE'S AMRE MOUSSA ON DARFUR AND HAMAS 
 
Classified By: DCM Stuart Jones for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (C)  Summary:  NEA Assistant Secretary David Welch and 
Arab League Secretary General Amre Moussa discussed regional 
affairs, including Syria, Iraq, Darfur, and Hamas, during a 
chance meeting in the airport VIP lounge on April 4.  On 
Israel/Palestine, Moussa said the League is urging Hamas to 
commit to the Arab Initiative and pressed the USG not to take 
drastic action during the first 100 days of the Hamas 
government.  On Sudan, Moussa said Salim Ahmed Salim, the 
AU's Chief Negotiator on Darfur, told him that there is a 
50/50 chance of reaching an agreement on security and a 
framework for reconciliation by the end of April.  If this 
succeeds, Moussa said the League will reconsider its stance. 
End summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) Syria and Iraq:  A/S Welch sarcastically welcomed the 
Arab League's position on Syria, noting that, because the 
League routinely says one thing and does the opposite, the 
League's actual policy on Syria is likely to be different 
from its stated position (to support Damascus) and thus in 
harmony with U.S. objectives.  On Iraq, Moussa confirmed that 
there is a split among the Shia and asked what the Secretary 
had achieved during her recent visit. A/S Welch told Moussa 
that the Secretary pressed for the immediate formation of a 
new government and greater cooperation among the key 
personalities. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Israel/Palestine:  Moussa said the League is urging 
Hamas to commit to the Arab Initiative and pressed the USG 
not to take drastic action during the first 100 days of the 
Hamas government.  Hamas wants a ""clean"" government, Moussa 
observed.  He also argued that the Initiative meets all 
parties' objectives because Hamas would be working 
non-violently within a framework for peace to achieve two 
states and would therefore implicitly recognize Israel.  A/S 
Welch disagreed strongly, explaining that while the USG would 
not criticize Hamas for endorsing the Initiative, it 
represents less than Abu Mazen's commitment, which the 
international community supports.  A/S Welch also said 
Hamas's ongoing ""subcontracting"" of its violent operations is 
a real concern. 
 
¶4.  (C)  Moussa pressed for details on what Hamas will get in 
exchange for cooperation.  A/S Welch said that it would take 
six weeks for Israel to form a platform, but noted there must 
be a Palestinian partner for negotiations.  Without this, 
Israel would move to protect the interests of its citizens. 
When Moussa urged the USG to give Hamas a ""grace period"" -- 
and not suspend financial aid -- A/S Welch underlined that 
there would be no/no aid to a Hamas government.  But 
humanitarian aid would continue directly and through 
organizations such as UNICEF and WFP, the A/S Welch said. 
Moussa retorted that the Arabs and Europeans would fund the 
government themselves.  A/S Welch disagreed, predicting the 
Europeans will not support the government.  Welch also warned 
that when Hamas feels it has accomplished its mission in Gaza 
and the West Bank, it will look to expand its influence 
elsewhere in the region (Egypt and Syria) because Hamas is 
more ""ikhwan"" (Muslim Brotherhood) than it is Palestinian. 
Welch noted the new Palestinian FM dreams of a map of the 
Middle East that does not include Israel. 
 
¶5.  (C)  Sudan:  Moussa said Salim Ahmed Salim, the AU's 
Special Envoy and Chief Negotiator for the Abuja talks, told 
him that there is a 50/50 chance of reaching an agreement on 
security and a framework for reconciliation by the end of 
April.  If this happens, Moussa said, the League will rethink 
its position. 
 
¶6.  (U)  A/S Welch cleared this cable.
