E.O. 12958: DECL: 08/20/2016
TAGS: PGOV PREL PTER EG IS IR LE SY
SUBJECT: DEFMIN PERETZ AND CODEL SPECTER DISCUSS LEBANON,
SYRIA, AND THE PALESTINIANS

Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones for reasons 1.4 (b,d).

¶1. (C) Summary: In an August 20 meeting with Senator Arlen
Specter in Jerusalem, Israeli Minister of Defense Amir Peretz
claimed victory against Hizballah, raised the possibility of
talks with Syria, and expressed concern that the
international community is not keeping its commitment to
deploy a robust force into southern Lebanon. He reiterated
his support for a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict based upon a return to the 1967 borders, with
exceptions made for Jerusalem and major Israeli settlement
blocs. Peretz advocated negotiations with, and support for,
Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas and claimed that
Israeli military activity has greatly weakened Hamas in the
Gaza Strip. He said that Khaled Meshaal is blocking a
possible release of an Israeli soldier held in Gaza and
expressed a willingness to negotiate with the Government of
Lebanon -- but not Hizballah -- concerning two Israeli
soldiers kidnapped on the northern border and Lebanese
nationals in Israeli custody. End summary.

--------------------------------------------- -------------
PERETZ CLAIMS SUCCESS IN LEBANON; DISCUSSES SYRIA AND IRAN
--------------------------------------------- -------------

¶2. (C) Peretz began the meeting by claiming victory in
Israel's clash with Hizballah. Although he acknowledged that
Hizballah is able to claim that it was successful by merely
surviving, he insisted that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)
had won every single battle. He said that the IDF would
learn from its losses -- most of which were the result of
anti-tank guided missiles, mines, and IEDs. He urged the
international community to re-define rules of engagement for
armed conflicts so that civilians who shelter terrorists are
treated as legitimate military targets. "Anyone who shelters
terrorists in his house risks not only his life, but also the
life of his family," warned Peretz. He also urged the
international community to take the lead on reconstructing
southern Lebanon in order to avoid any increase in Iranian
influence in the region.

¶3. (C) Senator Specter asked if Israel had considered taking
military action against Hizballah's state sponsors. Peretz
replied that the Iranian issue is one for the international
community, not just for Israel. Alluding to Hizballah's
support from Tehran, he added that "one cannot ignore that we
have fought against Iran." He said Israel had avoided
attacks on Syria for a number of reasons: to avoid opening a
"second front," to prevent pushing Syria "deeper into the
arms of Iran," and to preclude an excuse for the
reintroduction of Syrian forces into Lebanon. He suggested
that Israel and the international community should consider
whether negotiations with Damascus could possibly sever it
from the Iran-Syria-Hizballah axis.

--------------------------------------------- ---
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COMMITMENT TO UNSCR 1701
--------------------------------------------- ---

¶4. (C) Peretz complained that while Israel is fulfilling all
of its commitments under United Nations Security Council
Resolution (UNSCR) 1701, the international community's
willingness to do its part is "getting weaker and weaker."
He maintained that Israel had supported the UNSCR even though
the GOI would have preferred to continue military operations
against Hizballah for a "few more days." He expressed great
concern over the lack of serious commitment by potential
troop contributors (particularly France) and asked the USG to
more forcefully express its own views on this issue. He
cautioned that a failure to deploy the 15,000 troops would
leave Israel facing a situation even worse than the one that
existed when hostilities commenced, i.e., the Lebanese Armed
Forces will be in the IDF's field of fire if it is forced to
take renewed action. Accordingly, Peretz said that Israel is
preparing itself for another possible confrontation with
Hizballah. If a robust force does not deploy quickly, Peretz
asked the United States to remind the UNSC that Israel has a
right to defend itself.

-------------------------------------------
RETURN TO PRE-1967 BORDERS ... WITH CHANGES
-------------------------------------------

¶5. (C) Responding to Senator Specter's query about the
status of Israeli-Palestinian relations, Peretz said that he
supports a settlement based on the 1967 borders, but insisted
that the borders will need to be modified. He reiterated
Israel's unwillingness to withdraw from Jerusalem and the
major settlement blocs in the West Bank, but indicated that
the Palestinians could be compensated with other land.
Referring to the recent Qassam and Katyusha rocket attacks on
Israel, Peretz added that "tactical weapons affect strategic
decisions."

¶6. (C) Peretz categorized Israeli military actions in the
Gaza Strip as "very successful," saying the IDF has dealt
Hamas "a very severe blow." He stressed that Israel will not
negotiate with Hamas, but wants to deal with -- and
strengthen -- Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas.
He urged Abbas to take advantage of the weakness of Hamas to
"exert authority and lead."

--------------------------------------------- ----
SECURING THE RELEASE OF CAPTURED ISRAELI SOLDIERS
--------------------------------------------- ----

¶7. (C) Peretz indicated that Israel is more likely to secure
the return of the Israeli soldier abducted by Hamas than in
obtaining the release of the two Israeli soldiers kidnapped
by Hizballah. He claimed that Egypt, President Abbas, and
local Hamas leaders all want to release Cpl. Shalit in return
for an end to offensive military activity by the IDF in the
Gaza Strip, adding that Khaled Meshaal is preventing such a
deal. Peretz vowed that Israel would not negotiate with
Hizballah, but said the GOI is willing to deal with the
Government of Lebanon to discuss the IDF soldiers held in
Lebanon and Lebanese prisoners held by Israel. He stressed,
however, that Israel has learned from its previous mistakes
and will not include Palestinian prisoners in any such talks.

¶8. (U) CODEL Specter did not have the opportunity to clear
this message before departing post.
