SUBJECT: SRI LANKA: INDIAN NAVY REPORTEDLY LIFTS OBJECTIONS 
TO U.S.-PROVIDED MARITIME RADAR 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Robert O. Blake, Jr., for reasons 1.4(b, d). 
 
¶1. (C) On June 5, Sri Lanka Director of Naval Projects and Plans (DNPP) Commodore Lakshman Illangakoon contacted Embassy's Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) to provide a readout of a meeting in New Delhi with the Indian Navy Commander and others (no further information) on the proposed U.S.-provided coastal radar system.  India had been pressing Sri Lanka to have the U.S. system moved to Sri Lanka's southern coast and install an Indian-provided system. 
Illangakoon told us the Sri Lanka Navy Commander had instructed him to hold firm that the U.S.-provided coastal radars should be installed in the north, if necessary over Indian objections. 
 
¶2.  (C) Commodore Illangakoon reported that during his meeting in New Delhi, the Indian Navy Commander said India is no longer pressing Sri Lanka to move the U.S. provided coastal radars to the south, and the radar installation may proceed as planned.  India also plans to provide additional radars to Sri Lanka.  Illangakoon told ODC that Sri Lanka will work with the U.S. team to esnure that the Indian radars can be integrated into the current U.S. program. 
 
¶3. (C/NF) An Indian embassy official conveyed to Defense Attache that India would not press Sri Lanka or the U.S. to move U.S. provided radars but would consider other options, such as placing Indian-provided radars alongside the U.S. system to cover dead spaces. 
 
¶4.  (C) Embassy understands that DAO New Delhi will seek further confirmation of the Indian position via military channels and thanks Embassy New Delhi for its assistance.
