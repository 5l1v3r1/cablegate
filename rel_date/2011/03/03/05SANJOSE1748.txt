SUBJECT: LETTER FROM EX-PRESIDENT MIGUEL ANGEL RODRIGUEZ 
FOR PRESIDENT BUSH 
 
 
On August 3, post received two letters from former president 
Miguel Angel Rodriguez, addressed to President Bush and USTR 
Portman.  The letters, both written in English, contain Mr. 
Rodriguez's congratulations on U.S. Congressional approval of 
the U.S.-Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade 
Agreement (CAFTA-DR).  Mr. Rodriguez, who is currently under 
house arrest pending charges of corruption, was a proponent 
of a free trade agreement with the United States during his 
tenure as president from 1998-2002.  Calling Mr. Bush a "very 
good friend of Central America," Mr. Rodriguez states that, 
"Your decisive and courageous leadership and commitment to 
free trade, along with (Ambassadors Portman and Zoellick) 
will have a significant effect on growth and development 
throughout the world."  Originals of the letters have been 
forwarded to WHA/CEN.
