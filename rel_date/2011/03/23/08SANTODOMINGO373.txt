SUBJECT: FM MORALES AND OAS REP ON RIO GROUP, OAS 
MINISTERIAL, HR REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 25971 
 
Classified By: P. Robert Fannin, Ambassador, Reasons 1.4(b), (d) 
 
¶1. (C/NF) Summary:  In a March 12 meeting with the 
Ambassador, Foreign Minister Morales described the successful 
outcome of the Rio Group Summit as a "team effort." 
Responding to Reftel demarche on the OAS Ministerial, Morales 
cautioned against any action that could scuttle the peace 
gains that the Dominicans helped achieve.  Morales also 
strongly criticized the Human Rights Report and alleged it 
was a U.S. response to "the success of the Dominican Republic 
in the Rio Group."  The XXXXXXXXXXX gave Post 
further details on the Rio Group Summit's dynamics and said 
he had proposed to Secretary-General Insulza the idea of 
joint patrols on Colombia's borders accompanied by OAS 
civilians.  End summary. 
 
Human Rights Report 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (C/NF) In the March 12 meeting, Foreign Minister Morales 
Troncoso was accompanied by Deputy FM Manuel Trullols and the 
Ambassador was joined by the DCM and POLOFF.  The Ambassador 
had requested the meeting to seek a readout of the Rio Group 
Summit; however, Morales immediately began a spirited 
criticism of the Human Rights Report.  Clearly perturbed, but 
citing few specifics, Morales described the report as "very, 
very bad" and "a low blow."  "We are in an election campaign 
here -- you need to think about who's your friend and who's 
your enemy....  Your friends are confused." 
 
¶3. (C/NF) Referring to a recent United Nations meeting in 
Geneva, in which reports of the UN Special Rapporteur on 
racism and Independent Expert on minority issues were 
discussed, the Foreign Minister said, "At least they gave us 
a chance to comment; you didn't."  Morales said the Human 
Rights Report was overly reliant on information provided by 
NGOs, including groups led by activists Father Christopher 
Hartley and Sonia Pierre, individuals that he described as 
"divisive."  "How can we be racist if we are of mixed blood? 
There is no discrimination here."  (Note:  In comments to the 
press on March 12, Morales linked the Report and the Rio 
Group Summit, stating "that report is the product of the 
success that the Dominican Republic achieved in the Rio 
Group, and that upset them (the U.S.)."  End note.) 
 
¶4. (C/NF) Turning to the Trafficking in Persons Report, the 
Foreign Minister complained that, "this is costing us money 
-- we had to hire lawyers," and said that he planned to meet 
with these legal advisers in Washington next week. 
 
¶5. (C/NF) The DCM explained to Morales that the Report had 
been embargoed and noted that the UN's Geneva meeting also 
reviewed U.S. record on race issues.  POLOFF added that the 
release date is the same for all countries and is unrelated 
to the timing of the Dominican presidential election.  The 
DCM suggested that if the Foreign Minister sought to provide 
additional input for the TIP Report, that he should consider 
meeting with G/TIP Ambassador Lagon while in Washington. 
Morales replied that he did not have time for such a meeting. 
 
Rio Group Summit 
---------------- 
 
¶6. (C/NF) Turning to the original purpose for the meeting, 
the Ambassador congratulated Morales for the success of the 
Rio Group Summit.  Morales said that the outcome was a "team 
effort," citing positive contributions from the Presidents of 
Mexico, Panama, Honduras, Peru, and El Salvador.  He said 
that the discussion between Presidents Fernandez and Uribe 
over dinner had played an important role in resolving the 
 
conflict.  He described Uribe as a "good statesman, but also 
tough." 
 
¶7. (C/NF) In a separate meeting with POLOFF on March 13, the 
XXXXXXXXXXX in the Dominican Republic, XXXXXXXXXXXX
provided additional details on the 
dynamics at the Summit.  XXXXXXXXXXX, a XXXXXXXXXXX national, said 
that he was the only XXXXXXXXXXXX present at the meeting. 
The presidents, eager to get to the Colombia-Ecuador issue, 
worked quickly through the original agenda, which included 
Dominican advocacy for Haiti to join the Rio Group, which was 
approved. 
 
¶8. (C/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX said that President Correa, the first 
speaker to address the conflict in South America, denounced 
"unilateralism" and called Uribe a "liar."  The OAS 
Representative described Uribe's response as "very effective" 
because Uribe cited specific details regarding the FARC's 
operations in Ecuador based on the information in Raul Reyes' 
recovered personal computer.  The Colombian's style was 
initially "intellectual," but "heated up" as he went on, 
eventually speaking for more than an hour.  President Ortega 
of Nicaragua complicated the affair by raising Colombia's 
separate territorial dispute with his country.  In contrast, 
XXXXXXXXXXX said, President Chavez's interventions were less 
combative than he expected, considering Chavez's behavior at 
previous international meetings. 
 
¶9. (C/NF) XXXXXXXXXXX said that as the Summit continued, working 
through lunch, President Calderon of Mexico made very helpful 
interventions.  President Kirchner of Argentina also helped 
the movement toward resolution; however, she also managed to 
slip in a biting critique of "unilateralism."  The 
discussion, XXXXXXXXXXX said, struck him as more open and frank 
than OAS meetings, which he attributed to the absence of 
United States and Canada. 
 
¶10. (C/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX said that, as chairman, Fernandez played 
the key role in reaching a successful conclusion to the 
Summit.  At the crucial moment, Fernandez spoke about the 
need for Latin American unity, cited Uribe's apology, and 
claimed that Uribe had pledged not to take similar action in 
the future.  The Dominican President then invited Uribe and 
Correa to embrace and shake hands, and called on the other 
Presidents to stand and applaud.  This final suggestion was 
masterful, XXXXXXXXXXX argued, because once the other Presidents 
rose and applauded, Uribe and Correa has no choice but to 
embrace and shake hands.  Then Ortega again complicated 
matters by asking what would be done to address Nicaragua's 
territorial concerns; however, Uribe diffused the issue by 
pledging not to deploy Colombian forces beyond a specific 
geographic coordinate.  (Note: XXXXXXXXXXXX said he could not 
recall the precise coordinate). 
 
¶11. (C/NF) XXXXXXXXXXX also told POLOFF that, during 
Secretary-General Insulza's refueling stop here on March 12, 
 
SIPDIS 
XXXXXXXXXXX had presented to the OAS leader a plan for calming 
tensions between Colombia and its neighbors.  XXXXXXXXXXX 
proposal is for joint patrols by the militaries of Colombia 
and Ecuador/Venezuela, which would be accompanied by civilian 
officials from the OAS.  The fact that the OAS officials 
would be civilians would address Uribe's stated refusal to 
allow "international peace forces" into the area, XXXXXXXXXXX 
argued. 
 
OAS Ministerial 
--------------- 
 
¶12. (C/NF) In their March 12 meeting, the Ambassador also 
delivered Reftel demarche on the OAS Ministerial, emphasizing 
that the Consultation of Ministers should be forward-looking 
and should address the transnational threats that continue to 
 
pose a significant threat to peace and stability in the 
region.  Morales said that he would be attending the meeting 
and that the findings from Insulza's trip to South America 
were likely to be the primary point of discussion.  The FARC 
is a "narco-terrorist group;" however, "we need to be careful 
on Monday because everyone thinks things were solved here (at 
the Summit)....  Things have quieted down -- let's not go 
back." 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶13. (C/NF) The vehemence of Morales' attack on the Human 
Rights Report struck us as over the top, even for a Foreign 
Minister known for aggressive defense of his country's human 
rights record.  And he knows that the Report's release is 
unrelated to the presidential election here.  Regarding his 
claim that the Report is a response to the successful Rio 
Group Summit, Post plans to issue a press release restating 
the U.S. position on the Colombia-Ecuador issue.  While we 
can only speculate, Morales' outburst may have been motivated 
by chagrin that the positive press that the country was 
receiving after the Rio Group did not play out for longer, in 
part because it was displaced by coverage of the Human Rights 
Report.  Regarding Morales' linking of the Report and the Rio 
Group, this may have been a tactic designed to make his 
critique of the U.S. be the main story, as opposed to the 
content of the Report receiving all of the headlines.
