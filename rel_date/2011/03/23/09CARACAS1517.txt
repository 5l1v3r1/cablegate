SUBJECT: Ambassadors Discuss Expulsion of Colombian Miners/Colombian 
Venezuelan Bilateral Relations 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: DUDDY, AMBASSADOR, DOS, AMB; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1.       (C) Summary: On December 1, Ambassador met with Colombian 
Ambassador to Venezuela Maria Luisa Chiappe at the residence of 
Mexican Embassy Political Counselor Maria Elena Alcaraz, at the 
former's request. Ambassador Chiappe confirmed reports that late 
last week approximately 500 miners - mostly Colombian but also 
including some Brazilians - who were operating illegally at a mine 
in Venezuela's Amazonas state near the border with Colombia were 
expelled by Venezuelan security forces into Colombia. She also said 
that there were reports that approximately 1,000 miners working in 
the same location had managed to evade the security forces and were 
likely hiding out nearby, but required assistance from an 
international body such as the Red Cross to ensure their health and 
welfare. Regarding Colombian-Venezuelan bilateral relations, 
Ambassador Chiappe expressed concern over the deleterious impact 
that the current crisis has had on the previously robust trading 
relationship. She also noted the deterioration of the security 
situation along the border, alluding to the unfettered access of 
many armed groups to the Venezuelan side of the border. End 
Summary. 
 
 
 
¶2.       (C) As a result of not wanting to be seen entering the 
U.S. Embassy, Ambassador Chiappe directed her request for a meeting 
with Ambassador Duddy through mutual acquaintance Maria Elena 
Alcaraz of the Mexican Embassy, who hosted the informal 
conversation at her residence. Ambassador Chiappe began by 
confirming reports that late the previous week, Venezuelan armed 
forces helicopters descended on a mine near the border with 
Colombia in the western part of Venezuela's Amazonas state. (Note: 
while she did not specifically cite the date or location, other 
information available to post indicates these events took place at 
the Yacapana mine near San Fernando de Atabapo on September 26. End 
Note.) Of the 1,500 miners reportedly working there, the security 
forces expelled into Colombia approximately 500 miners who did not 
possess legal status to either live or work in Venezuela. 
Ambassador Chiappe affirmed that most of the miners were Colombian, 
although some were Brazilian. The other 1,000 miners managed to 
escape the security dragnet and flee into the surrounding 
countryside, where most likely remained. 
 
 
 
¶3.       (C) Ambassador Chiappe expressed the view that Venezuela 
had the right to deport foreigners  who were living and working 
illegally in the country, but also noted that the GOC expected the 
GBRV to "respect the human rights" of any individuals subject to 
forced repatriation. She highlighted the GOC's preoccupation with 
the well-being of the miners who were hiding out, stating that an 
International Red Cross team had tried to enter the area to check 
on them, but were apparently denied access to the area. In the 
current bilateral political environment, Ambassador Chiappe 
observed, the GOC feared that the GBRV might attempt to accuse the 
miners of being "paramilitaries," or of having some other nefarious 
intent. 
 
 
 
¶4.       (C) Regarding Colombian-Venezuelan bilateral relations in 
light of the ongoing dispute, Ambassador Chiappe identified trade 
and insecurity along the border as the GOC's primary worries. She 
confirmed widely circulated data that a precipitous drop in 
cross-border trade had transpired in a short period of time, and 
that this drop was particularly harmful to the Colombian 
communities living near the border with Venezuela, who depended on 
such trade for their livelihood. She also asserted that the 
Venezuelan side of the border area had become a haven for armed 
groups of all kinds, including but not limited to the FARC and ELN.
