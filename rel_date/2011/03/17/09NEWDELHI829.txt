¶1. (C) On April 25, National Security Adviser M.K. Narayanan told Charge that Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa had agreed to announce on April 27 a cessation of hostilities with the LTTE.  Narayanan, who had traveled with Foreign Secretary Shiv Shankar Menon to Colombo on April 24, related that he had persuaded Rajapaksa that further hostilities would create anger among Indian Tamils that could not be contained.  While Rajapaksa had ""more or less"" committed to the pause, Narayanan warned that the Sri Lanka President planned to consult with his cabinet on April 26 prior to making an announcement.  Narayanan asked that the U.S. keep quiet about this development until Rajapaksa fulfills his pledge and announces the pause. 

¶2. (C) Narayanan commented that, while the Sri Lankan military continued to shell an area where it believes LTTE Chief Prabakharan is located, it intends to capture Prabakharan alive.  Except for China, the international community has been united in calling for a cessation of hostilities, he said, adding that Beijing was looking for a special relationship with Colombo.  India plans to provide a generous assistance package for rebuilding after the war ends, Narayanan added.  Asked by the Charge about Rajapaksa's plans for next steps, Narayanan said he intends to pursue political devolution (""the thirteenth amendment plus"") and will made a gesture soon to win over Sri Lanka's Tamils. Narayanan mentioned that Sri Lankan Defense Secretary Gothabaya was currently paying a visit to New Delhi.
