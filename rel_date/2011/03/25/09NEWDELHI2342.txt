RESOLUTIONS WITH ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS 
 
REF: A. SECSTATE 118799      B. NEW DELHI 02227 

Classified By: POLCOUNS Uzra Zeya for Reasons 1.4 (B, D) 

¶1. (C) The Indian Mission to the UN in New York will vote in favor of resolutions that reaffirm support for the three UN institutions devoted exclusively to Palestinian issues as New Delhi remains unwilling to review its policy on Israeli-Palestinian issues.  On November 18, PolCouns conveyed Ref A points to Indian Ministry of External Affairs Joint Secretaries for UN Political (UNP) and UN Economic and Social (UNES) Divisions urging them to review their policy on the redundant and costly institutions and request their permanent representative to the UN Mission in New York to abstain or be absent when these and other UN resolutions with an anti-Israel bias came to a vote. 

¶2. (C) In reply, Director of UNP Division, Sanjay Rana, told Poloff on November 19 that India would not change its position on such resolutions.  Despite Delhi's ongoing consideration of such resolutions, the Indian Government has a ""consistent and strong position"" on the Israeli-Palestinian debate, Rana explained.  He reiterated the statement made in early November by the Indian Deputy Envoy to the UN that ""India's commitment to the Palestinian cause is complete."" Poloff noted our objections to such resolutions stem largely from the fact that their one-sidedness only detracts from the institutional credibility of the UN and damages the peace process. 

¶3. (C) Comment: Despite India's good relations with Israel, India's interests in fora like the UN are usually in lock-step with Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) countries, especially on issues related to the Middle East (Ref B).  The Indian Government is likely to remain inflexible on its UN voting strategy through the 64th UN General Assembly and continue to support resolutions with an anti-Israel bias. Its aim is to stay in good favor with NAM countries which presumably would support India's candidacy for a non-permanent seat during October 2010 UN Security Council elections.  End Comment.
