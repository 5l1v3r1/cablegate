(C) Poloff delivered reftel on USG priorities for UN reform to MEA Deputy Secretary (UN Political) Pankaj Sharma on June 15.

Noting that New Delhi recognizes the USG is still considering all options, Sharma quipped that India is waiting as if it had made a marriage proposal: the wait is less of a concern ""as long as we get the right answer.""
