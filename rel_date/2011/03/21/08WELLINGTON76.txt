Â¶1. (C) On February 28, Andrew Robinson, a Middle East and
Africa policy officer from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and Trade (MFAT) contacted the Embassy to report on his
initial feedback from the Ministry of Defense regarding
possible GNZ assistance on addressing piracy off the Somalian
coast. Robinson contacted Lt. Colonel Justin Emerson in the
MOD's legal division, who indicated that the GNZ would be
interested in maintaining a dialogue with the USG on the
types of specific requirements that might be requested from
the UN. Robinson indicated that the GNZ was aware of the
UNSC discussion surrounding Somalia. The New Zealand Navy,
he continued, has specialized skills in addressing
piracy/maritime thuggery, such as nighttime boarding of
suspect vessels. He also noted that the New Zealand Navy
will be sending a frigate to the Gulf region in June. While
not making any commitments at this stage, Robinson said that
the MOD will continue to explore and discuss how New Zealand
might assist in addressing this issue, and asked that the GNZ
be kept in the information loop.
