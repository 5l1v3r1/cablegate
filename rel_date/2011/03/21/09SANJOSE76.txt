EARTHQUAKE, SECURITY ASSISTANCE 
 
REF: SAN JOSE 0023 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  In a January 29-30 official visit to Costa 
Rica, Spanish Secretary of State Trinidad Jimenez announced 
USD 285,000 in earthquake assistance and donated 25 
motorcycles to the GOCR's transit police.  During  meetings 
with President Arias and FonMin Stagno, Jimenez focused on 
topics including:  the pending Central American-EU trade 
agreement, transportation, and environmental cooperation. 
Spanish diplomats told us in a December Mini-Dublin meeting 
that Spain maintained an active security/law enforcement 
assistance program in Latin America and was concerned (as we 
are) about low Costa Rican conviction rates.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) The GOCR will use the USD 285,000 in earthquake relief 
to rebuild aqueducts that serve 90,000 people in 12 affected 
municipalities; to rebuild/repair schools that serve 4,000 
students; to construct temporary housing; to implement 
disaster risk prevention programs; and to provide 
psychological assistance to victims of the 6.2 magnitude 
earthquake on January 8 which killed 23 and injured over 100 
(Reftel).  Over 1400 are still in shelters following that 
disaster, which the GOCR estimates could have caused as much 
as USD 100 million in damage.  The MFA confirmed that the 
Spanish contribution actually included USD 100,000 in Spanish 
donations that were announced earlier in January.   Jimenez 
also visited the town of Poasito, in the earthquake damage 
zone.  (Full MFA release on the visit emailed to WHA/CEN.) 
 
¶3. (U) Additionally, the National Transit Police accepted 25 
used motorcycles delivered by the Spanish Civil Guard.  NOTE: 
 The Transit Police are part of the Ministry of Public Works 
and Transportation, MOPT, and are not part of the regular 
national police force.)  In announcing the donations, Jimenez 
expressed Spain's "definite and firm commitment" to Costa 
Rica. 
 
¶4. (U) The MFA held a "working meeting" with Jimenez that 
focused on strengthening political dialogue, international 
assistance and trade -- three areas that have become pillars 
of all the GOCR's bilateral talks.  With Spain assuming 
the EU presidency, the GOCR hoped that the Central 
American-EU trade agreement under negotiation could be 
finalized within a year, and formally announced at a Central 
American-Spanish summit to be held in Madrid in January 2010. 
 
¶5. (U) In other areas of cooperation, the MFA told us that 
four passenger trains that Costa Rica purchased from Spain 
are scheduled to arrive later this month for use in the 
re-opened commuter-rail line from San Jose to Heredia (an 
outlying, populous town north of San Jose in the Central 
Valley).  The GOCR also presented proposals for potable water 
and water sanitation projects that it hoped would be eligible 
for international environmental funding.  In addition, the 
GOCR expressed hope that Spain would purchase carbon credits 
from Costa Rica.  According to the MFA, Spain's 2008 
assistance to Costa Rica amounted to 14 million euros, 
primarily designated for education and safe-drinking-water 
programs. 
 
¶6. (SBU) In a December Mini-Dublin meeting, the Spanish 
representative told our international audience that Spain had 
a broad security/law enforcement cooperative program in Latin 
America.  Spain provided training on organized crime, 
ballistics and police investigations to 25-30 Costa Rican 
officials in 2008 as part of its regional training 
initiative.  The diplomat noted Spain's concern with low 
conviction and case resolution rates in the Costa Rican court 
system -- a concern shared by many observers here, including 
us.  (NOTE:  From 1998-2008, an average of only 10 percent of 
all criminal court cases were resolved in Costa Rica.) 
 
¶7. (U) COMMENT:  We welcome Spain's willingness to extend 
disaster aid, as well as training opportunities and equipment 
donations for Costa Rican security forces; we are 
coordinating with them as members of our Mini-Dublin group. 
All the police and security forces need help here, and 
European aid to the transit cops complements our focus on the 
regular police, the coast guard and other law enforcement 
entities.  With this latest contribution, Spain, China, 
Colombia, the United States and Chile have provided the most 
(or most-publicized) bilateral earthquake assistance to Costa 
Rica.  Depending on GOCR needs, we may offer additional help, 
via SOUTHCOM humanitarian assistance funds and/or OFDA.  The 
GOCR is still evaluating its longer-term housing, 
infrastructure and disaster preparedness needs.  If we do, we 
will report same.  END COMMENT.
