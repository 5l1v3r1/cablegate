SUBJECT: MAGNITUDE 6.2 EARTHQUAKE, COSTA RICA 
 
¶1. AS A RESULT OF DAMAGE CAUSED BY A MAGNITUDE 6.2 EARTHQUAKE THAT 
OCCURRED AT 13:21 ON JANUARY 8, 2009, THE CHIEF OF MISSION HAS 
DETERMINED THAT THE DISASTER IS OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE TO WARRANT 
USG ASSISTANCE, AND THAT PROVIDING ASSISTANCE IS IN THE BEST 
INTEREST OF THE USG. THE SITUATION HAS EXCEEDED THE EFFECTIVE 
RESPONSE CAPACITY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF COSTA RICA, AND ASSISTANCE 
WAS REQUESTED BY THE COUNTRY'S PRESIDENT IN A DIRECT CONVERSATION 
WITH THE COM. THUS, THE COM IS EXERCISING HIS DISASTER ASSISTANCE 
AUTHORITY. 
 
¶2. THE QUAKE'S EPICENTER WAS SOME 20 MILES NW OF SAN JOSE, IN THE 
VICINITY OF THE POAS VOLCANO. THIS QUAKE OCCURRED AT A DEPTH OF 
APPROXIMATELY 28 KILOMETERS. THE EARTHQUAKE AFFECTED THE CENTRAL 
VALLEY. THERE WERE REPORTS OF SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE IN AND AROUND THE 
CITIES OF HEREDIA AND ALAJUELA, WITH AN AS YET UNDETERMINED NUMBER 
OF HOMES AND OTHER BUILDINGS DAMAGED, INCLUDING THE MUNICIPAL 
BUILDING IN ALAJUELA. RESPONSE EFFORTS ARE CENTERED ON THE AREA OF 
VARA BLANCA, WHICH IS LOCATED BETWEEN THE POAS AND BARVA VOLCANOES. 
FROM VARA BLANCA TO THE NORTH, ALONG THE SARAPIQUI RIVER, THERE 
HAVE BEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF LANDSLIDES, WHICH ARE HAMPERING 
ASSISTANCE EFFORTS. THERE ARE REPORTS OF PEOPLE HAVING BEEN INJURED 
BY LANDSLIDES IN THIS CORRIDOR. 
 
¶3. BASED ON REPORTS FROM THE COSTA RICA RED CROSS, 2,377 PEOPLE WERE 
DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE QUAKE, WITH 1,078 BEING HOUSED IN TEMPORARY 
ACCOMMODATIONS. FOUR DEATHS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED, ALTHOUGH LOCAL 
MEDIA ARE CURRENTLY REPORTING 13 DEATHS. AN ADDITIONAL 14 PERSONS 
ARE MISSING. 
 
¶4. SINCE ROAD ACCESS IS BLOCKED, THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY COMMISSION 
(CNE) HAS ESTABLISHED AN AIR BRIDGE TO EVACUATE INJURED AND ISOLATED 
PEOPLE. AS OF LATE ON 9 JANUARY, AN ESTIMATED 600 PEOPLE WERE 
INACCESSIBLE IN A 16 KM. STRETCH OF OBSTRUCTED AND/OR DESTROYED 
MOUNTAIN ROAD. THE REGION HAS SUFFERED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF 
LARGE LANDSLIDES, AND WITH AFTERSHOCKS CONTINUING, ADDITIONAL SLIDES 
ARE POSSIBLE. THUS, PROMPT EVACUATION IS ESSENTIAL. 
 
¶5. THE AMBASSADOR'S AUTHORITY OF $50,000 WILL BE USED BY POST TO PAY 
FOR RENTAL OF HELICOPTERS TO AUGMENT THE CAPACITY BEING DEPLOYED BY 
THE CNE. THIS AIR SUPPORT WILL BE USED TO EVACUATE INJURED AND 
ISOLATED PEOPLE FROM THE DISASTER ZONE AND MOVE THEM TO SAFETY. 
 
¶6. THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS UNDER A GOCR-DECLARED RED ALERT. PRESIDENT 
ARIAS SPOKE WITH THE COM AND SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED ASSISTANCE WITH 
THE AIR OPERATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. 
 
¶7. USAID/OFDA CONTINUES TO COORDINATE WITH THE CNE. POST WILL 
ADVISE IF OTHER HUMANITARIAN GAPS ARE IDENTIFIED AND REQUEST 
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AS APPROPRIATE.
