SUBJECT: Costa Rica's Spectrum Auction 
 
¶1. (U) Costa Rica's telecom regulator, SUTEL, held a public meeting 
January 18th to announce the schedule and conditions under which 
the cellular phone market will be opened to competition. The method 
of choice will be a "hybrid" auction in which competitors must 
first demonstrate their qualifications and present their technical 
proposals. Then the qualifiers bid against each other for the 
cellular spectrum. Only companies that have operated in multiple 
countries and managed networks of similar size and complexity to 
Costa Rica's network will qualify. The published schedule starts 
with SUTEL's presentation of the auction announcement February 5, 
followed by reception and examination of the companies' technical 
proposals on March 19, opening of the bids on April 16th, delivery 
of SUTEL's recommendation to the Executive April 20, and signature 
of the concession contracts three days before the end of the Arias 
Administration on May 5. If all goes as planned, the new cell phone 
competitors would begin operating in the market in late 2010. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Despite the formal nature of the announcement, we 
anticipate some problems going forward. The manner in which the 
schedule has been compressed in order for contracts to be signed by 
the outgoing Administration raises some concern that the process is 
too hurried. One specific issue that has not yet been 
satisfactorily resolved is designation and use of the microwave 
frequencies that are used to transmit signals from each individual 
radio tower to trunk lines. Those microwave frequencies are 
partially occupied by ICE and television operators and are not a 
part of the bid package. The President of the SUTEL board George 
Miley stated that, at some point after the May 5 contract 
signature, the GOCR will ensure that the winners of the cellular 
licenses are given sufficient transmission capacity over microwave 
frequencies. The frequencies will be made available on a 
non-exclusive basis to the auction winners through a process known 
as "direct concession". 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Administration's non-competitive assignation of 
microwave frequency on a non-exclusive basis will create 
uncertainty among prospective spectrum bidders.  As one observer 
told us with some hyperbole, building a cell-phone network without 
guaranteed microwave transmission capacity is "like building a 
highway without bridges."   We expect Vice Minister of 
Telecommunications Hannia Vega to address aspects of this issue in 
the near future, but any modification to the plan outlined above 
would likely require more time and upset the Administration's 
schedule.
