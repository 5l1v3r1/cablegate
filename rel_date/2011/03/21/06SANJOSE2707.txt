Requested demarche (reftel) delivered by Regional Environment 
Officer to Environment Ministry Director for International 
Cooperation Ruben Munoz on November 30 and by Econoff to Ministry of 
External Commerce (Ministerio de Comercio Exterior - COMEX) official 
Gabriela Castro.  Munoz had no immediate reaction to the demarche. 
He observed that the delay in distributing the relevant Summit 
documents complicated Costa Rican preparations.  He expressed 
disappointment that Central American countries had not achieved a 
better degree of coordination in the run-up to the Ministerial.
