SUBJECT: RESPONSE FROM COSTA RICA: COCESNA THREATENS TO CUT 
OFF ATC SERVICES TO AMERICAN AIRLINES 
 
REF: STATE 72975 
 
¶1. On July 14, we spoke with Jorge Fernandez Chacon, Director 
General of the Costa Rican Civil Aviation, regarding the 
dispute between American Airlines (AA) and Corporacion 
Centroamericana de Servicios de Navegacion Aerea (COCESNA). 
He clarified and/or reported the following to us: 
 
 -- Costa Rican air space was not closed and that up to 
20,000 feet AA would be provided Air Traffic Control Services 
(ATC); 
 -- However, if aircraft flew higher than 20,000 feet, ATC 
services to AA would not be provided; 
 -- Costa Rica must comply with COCESNA; 
 -- AA and COCESNA were apparently about to sign an agreement 
in Honduras so hopefully the Central American countries would 
not have to limit services to AA on July 15, 2009. 
 
¶2. Fernandez said that he had spoken with Sylvia Arias, the 
country manager for AA in Costa Rica, and had emphasized 
these points with her. 
 
¶3. Finally, to date we have been unable to meet with the 
Minister of Transportation, Karla Gonzalez, but hope to meet 
with her soon.
