REF: 10 STATE 15722 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Adam Smith, Second Secretary, DoS, P/E; REASON: 
1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Michael McBryde, the 
Foreign Ministry's UN Division Deputy Director, urging GNZ to vote 
no or abstain (as NZ did in November 2009) on the February 26 UN 
Goldstone Report draft resolution recently circulated by the 
Palestinian Observer Mission. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU)  McBryde stated that Jim McLay, NZ's UN Ambassador, 
follows Middle East issues very carefully and is well aware of 
sensitivities regarding the Goldstone Report.  Last November McLay 
recommended abstention on the Goldstone Report draft resolution 
because he felt that the UN should "take note of" the report, not 
endorse it.  NZ's UN delegation considers the latest draft 
resolution to be more "moderate and constructive", and it is 
waiting to see how European countries such as the UK, France, and 
Sweden will vote.  NZ's UN delegation will have the authority to 
finalize its position (and its vote) based upon how the February 26 
debate unfolds. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU)  NOTE:  James Kember, the Foreign Ministry's UN Division 
Director, will travel on March 11 to meet with NZ's European and 
New York-based UN delegations.  McBryde stated that Kember has only 
been in his current position since September 2009, and this will be 
his first trip to meet with these two groups.  McBryde referred to 
the trip as a "pastoral mission" and did not share any specific 
agenda items.  END NOTE 
 
 
 
¶4. (C/NF)  COMMENT:  When pressed, McBryde admitted that, in 
particular, New Zealand is watching to see how the UK will vote on 
the Goldstone Report draft resolution.  He said the UK has 
indicated that the new draft resolution is more "moderate and 
constructive", and there is a chance that London will change its 
vote from abstain to yes.  Post believes that a shift in the UK 
position could have a significant impact on New Zealand's vote. 
McBryde further confided that this is a "particularly sensitive 
issue because Ambassador McLay is scheduled to travel to several 
Middle Eastern countries next week (including Israel)."  END
