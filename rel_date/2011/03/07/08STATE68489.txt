TAGS: CS ETTC KOMC
SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050107493 
 
REF: 07 SAN JOSE 281 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050107493 for the export of 
firearms to Costa Rica. Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: End-user, Armeria J.R. Andre, was 
subject to an unfavorable EXTRANCHECK (reftel) in 2007. This 
end-use monitoring check is to verify the bona fides of the 
end-user. 
 
¶4. Action Request: End-user, Armeria J.R. Andre, was 
previously subject to an unfavorable EXTRANCHECK (reftel) and 
was found to be an unreliable recipient of dual-use items 
controlled by the US Department of Commerce. Post is 
requested to establish the bona fides of the end-user by 
making appropriate inquires to representatives of the company. 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
