(C) The Ambassador and visiting A/DAS David Lindwall 
delivered reftel demarche to Foreign Minister Tovar on 
January 17.  Tovar agreed with and claimed to share all of 
our concerns regarding Iran's serious breach of its 
commitments.  Tovar said Iran's public rhetoric reveals the 
true character of its leaders as people "willing to do 
anything."  Tovar also agreed on the need to make public 
statements in support of reporting Iran to the UNSC, but he 
stopped short of actually committing to do anything more than 
consult with UN Permrep Bruno Stagno on when/how such 
statements could be made.  We left the points as a nonpaper 
and will follow up at lower levels to try to ensure that a 
public statement is forthcoming.
