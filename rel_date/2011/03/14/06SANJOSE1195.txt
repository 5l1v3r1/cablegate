¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel talking points on May 31 to 
Carlos Cordero, Director of Multilateral Policy at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Cordero stated that Costa 
Rica's delegation to the OAS General Assembly meetings will 
be Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno, Amb. Jose Joaquin Chaverri, 
Director of Foreign Affairs, and Amb. Javier Sancho, Costa 
Rica's Ambassador to the OAS.  While Cordero declined to 
comment on the specific changes Venezuela has proposed to the 
Trade and Investment Resolution and the Declaration of Santo 
Domingo, he likened the current case to similarly disruptive 
tactics employed by Venezuela at the Bogota CICTE conference 
in March.  Cordero promised to pass the talking points to 
Foreign Minister Stagno and Ambassador Sancho. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Despite Cordero's non-committal response to 
USG concerns over Venezuela's behavior, he was clearly still 
upset by Venezuelan disruption of the CICTE conference, which 
he had attended.  Cordero has mentioned to Poloff on multiple 
occasions that Venezuela only served to further isolate 
itself regionally by employing such obstructionist tactics at 
OAS meetings.
