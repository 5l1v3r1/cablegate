REF: STATE 131146 
 
¶1.  Econoffs met with officials of the Costa Rican Ministry 
of Foreign Trade (COMEX) on September 25 to discuss the USG 
position contained in reftel targeting Middle Ground 
countries.  COMEX officials affirmed the GOCR's allegiance to 
the Middle Ground group as part of the Non-Agricultural 
Market Access (NAMA) negotiations. 
 
¶2.  However, COMEX argued that it could not accept a tariff 
coefficient lower than 22.  COMEX justified its position by 
stating that its status as a lesser-developed country within 
WTO and its market size required it to be prudent with any 
downward adjustment of tariff rates.  COMEX added that it 
needs to consider tariffs for agriculture goods when 
reviewing its tariffs on non-agriculture goods so as to 
maintain an overall balanced regime of tariffs.
