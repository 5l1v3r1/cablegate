SUBJECT: COSTA RICA CONSIDERING PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE 
DECLARATION 
 
REF: 40380 
 
¶1. We delivered reftel demarche on May 5 to Adriana Murillo, 
Head of the UN Security Council Team at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶2. On May 6, Murillo informed us that she had read the draft 
and had passed it to colleagues in the GOCR's Mission in New 
York, who already knew about the draft. They were studying 
the text but had not made a decision about co-sponsorship. We 
reminded Murillo that May 7 is the deadline to sign as a 
co-sponsor. She said the MFA would focus attention on this. 
 
¶3. We followed up again on May 7. Murillo stated that the 
declaration remained under study, although the GOCR is 
interested, in principle. She asked about willingness to 
accept additional elements in the text. Costa Rica is 
specifically interested in calling for greater access to 
prisoners of conscience by international entities. 
Additionally, the GOCR would like to know co-signers' future 
strategy (i.e. beyond this declaration) to keep attention 
focused on prisoners of conscience. 
 
¶4. Murillo noted that a colleague from the GOCR's UN Mission 
was to meet this afternoon (May 7) with officials from USUN 
and the EU Mission, and she hoped to have additional 
information after the meeting. Post will advise when/if a 
further response is received.
