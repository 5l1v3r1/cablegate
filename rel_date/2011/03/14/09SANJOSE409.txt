DESIGNATION OF DPRK ENTITIES SUBJECT TO ASSET FREEZE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 48525 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered Ref talking points on  May 13 to MFA 
disarmament officer Carlos Cordero. He thanked us for the 
information and also stated that they had also received a 
report on the same subject from their mission in New York. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cordero stated that as far as they were aware, none 
of the entities listed in Ref had any links to Costa Rica. 
However, he said that he would look into the matter further, 
and if the GOCR did discover the presence of any of the three 
organizations they would take appropriate action and notify 
us promptly.
