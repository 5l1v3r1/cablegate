SUBJECT: CENTRAL AMERICANS MAY SEEK "CONCAUSA III" WITH U.S. AMID 
HIGH HOPES FOR CLIMATE COOPERATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Enthused by the Obama Administration's early 
signals on climate change, Central American environment ministers 
have agreed to pitch the USG on the idea of launching a "CONCAUSA 
III" process, perhaps with a focus on climate change and with the 
inclusion of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).  As President Pro 
Tem of the Central American Commission for Environment and 
Development (CCAD), Nicaragua is drafting a letter to Secretary 
Clinton to propose the launch of CONCAUSA III at the April 17-19 
Summit of the Americas (SOA).  An advance draft of the letter is 
provided below.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Centrals to Pitch "CONCAUSA" Revival at Summit 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Jorge Cabrera, a former Executive Secretary of the Central 
American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD), called 
on Regional Environmental Officer (REO) Feb. 26 to advise that the 
region's environmental leaders hope to strengthen cooperation with 
the U.S. on environmental issues, particularly climate change. 
Cabrera said that Central American environment ministers are 
enthused by the Obama Administration's early signals on climate 
change, typified by one minister who said, "Thank God the U.S. will 
finally assume a serious role on climate change." 
 
¶3.  (U) Central American environment ministers decided at a February 
9 CCAD meeting in Managua to seek either the revival of "CONCAUSA 
II" or the start of a "CONCAUSA III" process with the U.S.  Cabrera 
said that CCAD's President Pro Tem, Nicaraguan Environment Minister 
Juana Argenal, has drafted a letter for the Nicaraguan Foreign 
Minister to send to Secretary Clinton (see para 6 below), with a 
view to a meeting with the USG at the April SOA in Trinidad & 
Tobago.  Cabrera, a Guatemalan engineer recently named by CCAD as an 
advisor to Argenal, said that the Central Americans see the U.S. as 
their "first partner of choice" and a "natural ally" on sustainable 
development.  They also hope to enlist their Caribbean counterparts 
into a more broadly-based partnership with the U.S., perhaps with 
greater focus on climate change. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) REO cautioned Cabrera against expecting a quick response, 
given the relatively short fuse before the SOA and given that their 
proposal had not been raised earlier during the SOA's preparatory 
process.  REO also noted that USG consideration of such a proposal 
would likely be seen through the prism of CAFTA-DR and other ongoing 
USG engagement in the region.  He encouraged Cabrera to frame such a 
proposal in terms of practical ways the region might work with the 
U.S. to boost opportunities for public-private partnerships and to 
foster private-sector led clean production and "green" jobs 
creation. 
 
COMMENT: An Opening for Regional Climate Engagement? 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Whether it's through a "CONCAUSA" revival, the Pathways to 
Prosperity initiative, the SOA, or some other venue, Central 
Americans are anxious to see stronger U.S engagement in the region 
on climate issues.  Various EU members have already stepped up their 
regional climate change diplomacy (septel) and clearly aim to shape 
Latin American and Caribbean outlooks heading into the December 2009 
climate change negotiations in Copenhagen.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶6.  (U) Below is an unofficial translation of CCAD's advance draft 
letter intended for Secretary Clinton.  REO will transmit the final 
letter immediately upon receipt. 
 
BEGIN TEXT OF DRAFT LETTER TO SECRETARY CLINTON 
 
Madame Hillary Clinton 
Secretary of State 
Government of the United States Government 
 
Madame Secretary: 
 
I want to inform you about the interest of the Central American 
countries in renewing the cooperation coalition between the USA and 
the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic subscribed 
in CONCAUSA.  During the Bush Administration, a CONCAUSA II was 
signed.  In that opportunity, economic and commercial issues were 
added. 
 
Making use of the interest of President Obama, particularly on 
Climate Change issues, our interest as a region is to renew this 
cooperation mechanism in a possible CONCAUSA III, which would 
include the USA and our region's priorities. 
 
If our proposal is feasible, please indicate the right contact 
person designated by your office who will be in charge of this 
proposal, with a petition to please include this initiative in the 
Summit of the Americas agenda.  We recognize that CARICOM countries 
should be included in the CONCAUSA III proposal. 
 
Minister of Foreign Relations of Nicaragua

CONCAUSA I y CONCAUSA II
