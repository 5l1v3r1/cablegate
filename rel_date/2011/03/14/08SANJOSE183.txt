REF: STATE 19889 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) On February 28 we met with Randolf Coto, 
Coordinator of Foreign Policy at the Foreign Policy Section 
of the MFA and made him aware of the USG concerns regarding 
the resolution.  We further urged the GOCR to consider 
alternative approaches 
 
¶2. (SBU) Coto indicated he would forward those concerns to 
the GOCR Mission in Geneva, but as of this time, the GOCR was 
committed to sponsoring the resolution.
