REF: STATE 66915 
 
Â¶1. On June 23, we delivered reftel points to Juan Salas, UNSC 
Desk Officer at the MFA. Salas said they had a copy of the 
UK's Presidential Statement and were in communication with 
their NY UN Mission to see "what the UN Mission says about 
it" since they have also heard that MDC Morgan Tsvangirai had 
taken refuge in the Embassy of The Netherlands. Salas 
promised to follow up once he had a firm answer.
