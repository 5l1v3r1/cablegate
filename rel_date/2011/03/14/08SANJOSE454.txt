¶1. On May 27, CDA delivered reftel to MFA's Chief of Staff 
Antonio Alarcon, and we followed up on May 28 with Alejandro 
Solano, MFA Deputy Director of Foreign Policy. The two said 
they would study the issue but made no commitments. 
 
¶2. Solano asked how specifically the issue of OAS election 
observers would be raised next week in Medellin. He requested 
that if the U.S. was planning to propose a resolution, that 
we please circulate the text to the GOCR in advance. Please 
advise how to respond and provide text, if any, for 
distribution to the GOCR as appropriate.
