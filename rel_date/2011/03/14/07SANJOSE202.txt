¶1.  (U) Per reftel, on January 30, Poloff discussed the May 
UN Human Rights Council (HRC) election with Tatiana Vargas, 
head of the international candidacies division within the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Poloff noted the USG's concerns 
about the performance of the HRC to date and encouraged Costa 
Rica, with its strong democratic tradition and respect for 
human rights, to run for the seat.  Vargas indicated that she 
has not received instruction from superiors to present a 
candidacy for this seat and that the MFA's 2007 priority is 
the UN Security Council seat election in October. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On February 1, PolCouns followed up with Antonio 
Alarcon, CoS to FM Bruno Stagno.  Alarcon understood 
immediately the importance of having strong democracies as 
members of the UNHRC, but he confirmed that the MFA,s (and 
GOCR,s) prime UN objective was the October UNSC elections. 
He expressed the personal opinion, in fact, that the UNSC 
seat would be the only position Costa Rica seeks in 2007. 
However, Alarcon undertook to consult with Stagno (currently 
in New York) before responding to us definitively on February 
¶2.
