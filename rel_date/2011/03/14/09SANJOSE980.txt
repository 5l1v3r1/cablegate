REF: STATE 114855 
 
Post contacted Alex May, Director of the Biotechnology Department 
of the Costa Rican Ministry of Agriculture and local point of 
contact for the Cartagena Protocol.  Mr. May informed post that he 
is planning to attend the IICA workshop in Chile.  He also 
mentioned that the Ministry of Agriculture is trying to obtain 
funding for a Costa Rican official to participate in the Kuala 
Lumpur event.  If funding is obtained, he will attend the Kuala 
Lumpur meeting as local point of contact of the Cartagena Protocol. 
Mr. May mentioned that his understanding is that the goal of the 
meeting in Chile is to continue the analysis of the issue but he 
believes that reaching a consensus or agreement during that meeting 
will be difficult.
