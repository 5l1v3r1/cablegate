Summary \
------- \
 \
1.(C) Swiss FM Calmy-Rey met with visiting Iranian nuclear \
negotiator Larijani on February 12 to review a Swiss 4-point \
proposal on how to resolve the nuclear impasse.  Swiss \
officials disputed press reports that their effort comprised \
"mediation effort" or an "initiative," and emphasized the \
proposal's consistency with UNSCR 1737.  Conditions included \
suspension of enrichment prior to talks; full cooperation \
with the IAEA (including the long-awaited timetable); \
transfer of all enrichment activities to a consortium; all \
followed by a comprehensive settlement on nuclear, economic, \
security, and political issues.  Scheurer denied an Iranian \
news report that the Swiss had offered up the possibility of \
a partial suspension of enrichment activities.  Larijani, for \
his part, told Calmy-Rey that she was even less flexible than \
the EU's Solana.  The Iranians had little concrete to offer, \
but Scheurer said he detected a more "constructive spirit" in \
the discussion.  DCM reiterated Washington's concerns about \
Swiss efforts, particularly in light of Switzerland's status \
as Protecting Power for the United States in Tehran.  End \
summary. \

------------------------- \
Swiss 4-Point Proposition \
------------------------- \
 \
2.(C) Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani met with Swiss \
Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey in Bern on February 12 \
after attending the Munich International Security Conference, \
or "Wehrkunde," over the weekend.  Larijani's aide Sayaad \
Monfarad and Deputy Foreign Minister Sa'id Jalili accompanied \
him.  On February 13, Swiss Department of Foreign Affairs \
Iran expert Guillaume Scheurer invited DCM and Poloff for a \
briefing on the talks, in order to reassure the USG that \
Switzerland is abiding by the consensus reflected in UN \
Security Council Resolution 1737.  Calmy-Rey, he said, \
bluntly told Larijani of Iran's isolation on the nuclear \
issue, its obligation to abide by UNSC and IAEA requirements, \
the present risk of escalation, and the imperative for Iran \
to be transparent and constructive in seeking a solution. \
 \
3.(C) Scheurer dismissed as "media spin" various press \
reports of a "Swiss Initiative" and "Swiss mediation." \
Rather, he said, FM Calmy-Rey (and State Secretary Ambuehl \
the previous week -- see reftel) had merely given Larijani a \
"proposition" to resolve the current impasse.  The \
proposition's four points were as follows: \
 \
¶A. Before talks begin, Iran commits itself to suspend all \
enrichment-related activities and to act in accommodation \
with provisions of the Additional Protocol, pending \
ratification of the Iranian Parliament, and to go beyond \
these provisions when demanded by the IAEA; \
 \
¶B. Three weeks after the start of talks, Iran presents a \
timetable for resolving outstanding issues with the IAEA; \
 \
¶C. A concrete proposal will be devised concerning an eventual \
consortium, through which all further Iranian enrichment \
activities will be transferred; \
 \
¶D. As soon as the above steps are achieved, negotiators will \
consider a comprehensive settlement package which includes \
nuclear and non-nuclear areas, such as economic cooperation, \
international security, and political dialogue (akin to past \
EU proposals, according to Scheurer). \
 \
4.(C) Scheurer insisted that the Swiss proposal did not, \
repeat not, offer up a "partial suspension," as was reported \
by the Iranian news agency "Flash News" on February 12.  He \
said FM Calmy-Rey had been angered when she read the Iranian \
spokesman's statement to Flash.  Scheurer said that Calmy-Rey \
had raised the notion of a "temporary suspension," though she \
asserted that anything the Iranians did would have to be in \
compliance with the IAEA. \
 \

Larijani's Reaction: Nothing Concrete, but a Better Spirit \
--------------------------------------------- ------------ \
 \
5.(C) According to Scheurer, Larijani told Calmy-Rey she was \
even less flexible than Solana.  He reiterated Tehran's long \
list of complaints about the West's lack of respect for Iran. \
 He repeated his comments from Wehrkunde, asserting that, \
 \

 \
 \
whatever the past, Iran was currently in compliance with the \
IAEA and that Iran should not be punished for violations it \
had yet to commit.  A potential consortium, he argued, must \
be in Iranian territory, not abroad.  Suspension was \
unacceptable as a precondition, though it could be the \
subject of "pre-talks," which he envisioned lasting up to two \
months. \
 \
6.(C) Asked whether he heard anything new in the meeting with \
Larijani, Scheurer acknowledged that there was nothing \
concrete, but that the "spirit" of the discussions were more \
hopeful.  The Iranians were more rational, less emotional \
than in previous meetings with the Swiss.  Scheurer's \
impression was that the Iranian side desired a solution, but \
had little idea how to get there within their current red \
lines, especially their refusal to suspend enrichment \
activities.  He gathered from Solana's people in Munich that \
they had the same impression. \
 \
--------------------- \
Washington's Concerns \
--------------------- \
 \
7.(C) DCM thanked Scheurer for the briefing, but reiterated \
the USG's concerns that Tehran might confuse their activities \
with Switzerland's status as Protecting Power in Iran.  She \
handed Scheurer the Department's guidance describing Iran's \
need to comply with the UNSC and IAEA.  Scheurer said that \
Bern was aware of the USG's concerns, but insisted that \
officials always stressed to their Iranian interlocutors that \
they were not speaking for Washington.  He was confident that \
Tehran understood this. \
