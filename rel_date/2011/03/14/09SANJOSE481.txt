¶1. (U) On June 5, we delivered reftel talking points to the 
MFA's Chief of Candidacies Lilian Rodriguez.  Rodriguez 
thanked us for the information and said that she would 
discuss the matter with the head of the External Policy 
office. 
¶2. (SBU) Rodriguez told us that given Ms. Myers was the only 
non-European candidate, it was likely that Costa Rica would 
support her candidacy.  However, Rodriguez promised to notify 
us as soon as a firm decision had been made.
