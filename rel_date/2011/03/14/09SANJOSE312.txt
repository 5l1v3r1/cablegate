SUBJECT: COSTA RICA WELCOMES QENERGY AND CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP OF THE 
AMERICAS,Q OFFERS INITIAL IDEAS 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Senior Costa Rican officials, including the 
Minister of Foreign Trade and the Minister of Environment, Energy, 
and Telecommunications (MINAET), welcomed President ObamaQs planned 
announcement of an QEnergy and Climate Partnership of the Americas 
(ECPA) at the upcoming Summit of the Americas (SOA).  The Ministers 
will raise ECPA at President Oscar AriasQ April 15 cabinet meeting. 
MINAET offered initial ideas for an ECPA (see Para 6) emphasizing 
joint efforts on climate change adaptation and mitigation that also 
contribute to poverty reduction, economic reactivation, job 
creation, and strengthening of low-carbon economies.  (See Para 5 
for full list of GOCR delegation to the SOA.)  END SUMMARY. 
 
GOCR Welcomes ECPA as QGreat News 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Regional Environmental Officer (REO) discussed ref points 
with Minister of Environment, Energy, and Telecoms Jorge Rodriguez 
on April 14.  Rodriguez, who will attend the Summit of the Americas 
with President Oscar Arias, welcomed President ObamaQs impending 
announcement of the QEnergy & Climate Partnership of the Americas 
(ECPA) as Qgreat news.Q  He said that ECPA appears to address many 
of Costa RicaQs interests regarding clean energy and energy 
efficiency.  Rodriguez appreciated that ECPA is not yet a fully 
formed venture and that the USG wanted input and ideas for the 
partnership. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In parallel, ECONOFF presented the general outline of the 
ECPA's proposed priorities and strategic framework to Minister of 
Foreign Trade Marco Vinicio Ruiz.  Although the minister will not 
attend the SOA, he nonetheless is engaged on how environmental 
issues impact economic development and the need to balance the two 
by committing to sustainable economic activities.  Minister Ruiz was 
enthusiastic on the general outline of ECPA and praised the 
collaborative approach of the initiative.  Likewise, POLOFF raised 
ECPA with Herbert Epinoza, who is organizing the Foreign MinistryQs 
team for the SOA.  He was very interested in the idea and would 
welcome further details. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Ministers Ruiz and Rodriguez both said that they will 
discuss the ECPA proposal at President AriasQ April 15 cabinet 
meeting.  Minister Ruiz added that he will see President Arias for 
at least two meetings that day and that he would approach President 
Arias specifically about ECPA.

Initial GOCR Ideas for ECPA 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U) Late on April 14, Minister Rodriguez passed to REO MINAETQs 
initial ideas for ECPA.  These ideas point to the GOCRQs hopes for 
joint efforts on climate change adaptation and mitigation that also 
contribute to poverty reduction, economic reactivation, job 
creation, and strengthening of low-carbon economies.  Below is an 
unofficial translation of MINAETQs non-paper.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Costa RicaQs initial warm embrace of the proposed ECPA 
reflects the GOCRQs commitment to promoting renewable energy and 
 
 
sustainable forestry, as well as Costa RicaQs stated goal of 
attaining carbon neutrality by 2021.  It also reflects the GOCRQs 
desire to play a leading role in the region on climate change.  The 
challenges will be first, in translating the GOCRQs lofty aims into 
pragmatic action, and second, in soliciting/including enough 
regional input to obtain full buy-in on ECPA, without making the 
initiative too unwieldy.
