REF: STATE 24665 
 
(SBU) On March 17, we delivered reftel demarche to Adriana 
Murillo of the MFA's UNSC team regarding support for the 
African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).  Murillo indicated 
that, in general, Costa Rica supports the AMISOM mission, but 
did not commit to making public statements of support for it. 
 However, she told us that the MFA would study the issue and 
would get back to us if they had further comments.
