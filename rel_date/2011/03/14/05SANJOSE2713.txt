Â¶1. (SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche on November 17 to 
Chief of Multilateral Affairs Carlos Cordero.  In a follow-up 
conversation on November 22, Cordero advised Poloff that he 
would likely be attending the conference in Geneva to discuss 
the adoption of a third protocol.  Cordero made clear that 
the GOCR is strongly in favor of adopting the third protocol 
under a religion-neutral symbol, such as the Red Crystal. 
Cordero has communicated the GOCR's position to its mission 
in Geneva, but hopes to represent the GOCR in person for the 
debate, scheduled for the first week of December.
