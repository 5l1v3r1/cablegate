¶1.  SUMMARY:  Embassy participated in an alternative 
energies conference sponsored by RECOPE, Costa Rica's 
national oil refinery, held at the University of Costa Rica 
on 24-25 October, 2007.  RECOPE organized this event as 
part of its "Quality Month" by inviting private companies, 
students, government, NGO's and general visitors to 
participate.  The embassies of Germany, France, 
Netherlands, Brazil, and Panama participated with the 
presence of some private companies as well.  Speakers 
included former Costa Rican astronaut Dr. Franklin Chang 
and Dr. Luis Horta of Brazil's Itajuba University.  The 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) furnished a 
booth and detailed brochures and post developed additional 
collateral information such as materials for students. 
Post estimates that 300 people participated including an 
estimate of 250 visitors to the Embassy booth.  END 
SUMMARY.

USG BOOTH 
========= 
 
¶2.  Post requested NREL's help for information and 
brochures.  NREL sent from the US a portable display and 
informational material to give out to the visitors and 
students.  A looping DVD describing Cellulosic Ethanol was 
played on a laptop. 
 
 
Embassy staff from the Environmental Hub, Econ, FCS and PAO 
contributed in managing the event for the Embassy, exhibit 
logistics, and attending to visitor's questions and 
comments.  Attendance was estimated at 300 visitors (of 
which 10 percent were students from high schools featuring 
scientific curricula). 
 
========== 
QUESTIONS? 
========== 
 
¶3. Visitors and students were very interested in USG 
achievements in biofuels and new technologies.  Questions 
of food security, environmental issues, algae fuel 
technology, and contact information for obtaining more 
information were typical inquiries asked of the Embassy 
staff.  Engineering and biology college students from the 
University of Costa Rica were very interested in biofuels 
production, as they were working on their thesis projects 
and needed relevant information. 
 
¶4.  The Embassy's booth attracted attention due to the NREL 
biofuels poster, the biofuels production DVD, and the 
variety of materials and brochures available for visitors. 
Dr. Franklin Chang, former NASA astronaut, came to the 
booth and greeted Embassy staff. 
 
========================================== 
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER EMBASSIES AND BOOTHS? 
========================================== 
 
¶5.  A neighboring exhibitor, Germany, had information about 
biodiesel production using canola oil along with other 
renewable energy information.  Brazil focused on sugar cane 
ethanol and attracted much attention.  France, the 
Netherlands, and Panama offered general information on 
their respective programs. 
 
¶6.  Private companies presented a variety of energy 
solutions including solar, hydraulic and wind powered 
generators.  These technologies were marketed as 
alternative energy solutions to mitigate or produce 
electricity in rural places and farms. Costa Rica's ICE 
(National Electricity and Telecomunication Institute) and 
CNFL (National Electricity Company) gave information on 
their hydraulic, wind and solar projects.

SPEAKERS 
======== 
 
¶7.  Former NASA astronaut Franklin Chang presented his 
vision on the promise of fusion generated nuclear power and 
VASIMIR plasma technology.  Dr. Luis Horta of Brazil spoke 
about the potential of energy from biomass and the 
fundamentals of ethanol production; students seemed to 
enjoy this the most.

COMMENT 
======= 
 
¶8.   Costa Rica wants to actively participate in an 
international discussion of alternative energy issues.  As 
an example of domestic commitment to alternative energy, 
RECOPE is planning to add a 7 percent ethanol blend for its 
vehicle fleet next year (reftels). This RECOPE sponsored 
event, their invitation to the different embassies, and a 
Round Table on Renewable Energy organized by the Ministry 
of Economy and Trade to take place on November 8, confirm 
that Costa Rica is committed to becoming the first carbon 
neutral country or at least to making incremental steps in 
that direction.  From an Embassy outreach perspective, the 
conference gave us a rare (and needed) chance to connect 
with students on the often anti-US UCR campus.  From an 
operational perspective, the event highlighted the 
importance of continued intra-Mission cooperation on cross- 
cutting scientific, economic and public diplomacy issues. 
END COMMENT.
