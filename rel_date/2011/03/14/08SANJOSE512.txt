SUBJECT: COSTA RICA REQUESTS SUPPORT FOR OAS-IACHR 
CANDIDATE MANUEL VENTURA ROBLES 
 
¶1. On June 3, we received a diplomatic note from the Costa 
Rican MFA requesting U.S. support for re-election of the 
GOCR's candidate Manuel Ventura Robles as Judge of the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights.  Elections are 
scheduled for June 2009. Relevant text appears below. 
 
¶2. Post is very familiar with Robles and highly recommends 
U.S. endorsement of Robles' candidacy. We understand from 
WHA/USOAS that the U.S. is not eligible to vote because the 
USG is not party to the American Convention on Human Rights. 
However, Post recommends that it would be worthwhile to 
support Robles' candidacy if there are other ways to do so. 
 
¶3. Following is unofficial translation of diplomatic note 
(relevant text): 
 
The Office of Foreign Policy of the Ministry of Foreign 
Relations and Religion gives its compliments to the Embassy 
and has the honor to express that the Government of Costa 
Rica has decided to present the candidacy of Manuel Ventura 
Robles for re-election as Judge of the Inter-American Court 
of Human Rights, for the period of 2010-2015, in the 
elections that will take place during the 39th Ordinary 
Sessions of the OAS General Assembly, in June 2009. 
 
With respect thereto, the Government of Costa Rica requests 
the Government of the United States to support the 
above-mentioned candidate. 
 
END TEXT. 
 
¶4. Please advise.
