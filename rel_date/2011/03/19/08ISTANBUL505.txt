SUBJECT: SEVENTH WAVE OF ERGENEKON ARRESTS 
 
REF: A. ISTANBUL 380 
     ¶B. ANKARA 1217 
 
Classified By: Classified by Consul General Sharon A. Wiener for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
 
¶1. (U) On September 18, in a seventh wave of 
Ergenekon-related detentions, Turkish police in Istanbul, 
Ankara, Izmir, Mersin, and Hakkari provinces took into 
custody 17 people.  (The religiously-oriented Zaman daily 
newspaper reports that 19 people were taken into custody, 
rather than 17, as reported by Dogan news agency affiliated 
outlets.) In Istanbul, five army lieutenants, a military 
academy student, well-known actress Nurseli Idiz, artistic 
manager Seyhan Soylu, and lawyer Levent Temiz were taken into 
custody. 
 
¶2.  (C) Temiz is the president of the nationalist 
organization Ulku Ocaklari (Ideal Home), which is widely 
believed to be the unofficial youth branch of the right-wing 
Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). Both Sabah and Taraf 
newspapers report the police have determined from a review of 
phone records that Temiz had ties with both the charged 
murderer of Hrant Dink and one of the terrorists involved in 
the July 9 attack on the U.S. Consulate.  This allegation 
follows a front page report in Zaman newspaper on September 
18 that made substantially the same allegations.  The Legal 
Attache in Istanbul advises it has no information regarding 
Temiz and reports no knowledge of any connection between the 
Ergenekon group and the attack on the U.S. Consulate.  The 
investigation into the July 9 attack is still on going. 
Turkish police have refused to speculate on an Ergenekon link 
to the attack. 
 
¶3. (U) Zaman claims, without explanation, that Soylu played a 
key role in the "post-modern military coup" in 1997 that led 
to the collapse of the Erbakan government.  Ruhat Mengi, 
columnist for mainstream Vatan, notes that the timing of this 
new Ergenekon operation seems designed to deflect attention 
from allegations swirling around PM Erdogan in connection to 
the Deniz Feneri corruption case. The 103 suspects accused of 
having suspicious links to Ergenekon will begin to appear in 
court on October 20, facing accusations that include 
"membership in an armed terrorist group."
