¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Arias administration has wasted no 
time in naming its new Ambassador to China, Antonio BURGUES 
Teran.  Burgues, an economist by training, Arias confidant, 
former PLN party treasurer and ex-GOCR minister, was sworn 
in on August 1.  He hopes to have a five-officer team join 
him at the new Costa Rican embassy in Beijing in 
September.  In public comments, Burgues has echoed the 
Arias administration,s optimism that Costa Rican niche 
products will find a significant market in China.  See 
biographic information in para 5.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) China continues to be a 'flavor of the month' in 
Costa Rican foreign relations.  Burgues, name surfaced in 
the media in mid-July, but he reportedly had been selected 
by President Oscar Arias in late June, just weeks after 
Costa Rica,s recognition of China.  Burgues, a first-time 
diplomat, told interviewers that he does not seek a large 
embassy, just an 'effective' one.  Among his top goals: 
opening commercial relations, promoting tourism and seeking 
Chinese support for Costa Rican global (and UN) policy 
initiatives.  The Ministry of Foreign Trade (COMEX), 
meanwhile, has fed a steady stream of media reports touting 
the enormous size of the Chinese market, the hoped-for 
appetite for Costa Rican products, and the (positive) 
implications of Chinese relations on eventual APEC 
membership for Costa Rica.   Some commentators have even 
implied (erroneously) that improved trade ties with China 
might help compensate for Costa Rica,s not joining CAFTA, 
if that proves to be the case after the October 7 
referendum. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) For his part, Chinese Ambassador Wang Xiaoyuan 
has carefully played down prospects for Costa Rica,s 
immediate entry into APEC, citing the long-standing and 
complex moratorium issue.  At the same time, he and VP 
Kevin Casas will be the major attractions at an August 7 
conference in San Jose, organized by the national chamber 
of business chambers (UCCAEP) on doing business with China. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:   If relations with China were 
inevitable for Costa Rica, some parts of the GOCR and some 
sectors of the public are still adjusting to the suddenness 
of the shift in ties  from Taipei to Beijing.  The Air 
Unit of the Ministry of Public Security, for example, has 
had to scramble to find funding to complete refurbishment 
of an aging C-7 Caribou transport it hopes to put back in 
service.  The Taiwanese had been helping with the funding. 
Also, in the most recent CID-Gallup poll (released July 
27),the 
second-most cited criticism of the Arias administration, by 
those who mentioned something specific, was the break with 
Taiwan.  The GOCR,s push for CAFTA approval was the 
most-cited criticism.  (Neither was cited by a large 
percentage of those polled, however.)  END COMMENT.
