<br>SUBJECT: WHY FRANCE CLAIMS SYRIA HELPED CONVINCE IRAN TO 
<br>FREE FRENCH PRISONER 
<br>
<br>REF: A. PARIS POINT AUGUST 18 2009 
<br>¶B. PARIS 1097 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Kathleen H. Allegrone, for 
<br>reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Despite their proactive media blitz 
<br>proclaiming Syria's "important" role in persuading Iran to 
<br>release French citizen Clotilde Reiss from prison, French 
<br>officials admit in private they do not know what Syrian 
<br>President Assad, or his government, actually did. The French 
<br>have deliberately publicized Assad's role in order to 
<br>encourage Assad to play a more constructive intermediary role 
<br>in the region, and to sew seeds of discord between Syria and 
<br>Iran. This French media effort also aims to validate 
<br>Sarkozy's policy of early engagement with Syria. In 
<br>addition, French officials provided a few more words of 
<br>advice on handling the American hostages in Iran, and 
<br>described the compromises they made to secure Reiss's 
<br>release. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>SYRIAN ROLE: THE SPIN 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Since August 11, when a French Presidency press 
<br>release first singled out Syria for appreciation, French 
<br>government officials, journalists, and academics have 
<br>pondered the "important" and "influential" role Syria played 
<br>as "mediator" between France and Iran in the conflict 
<br>surrounding the July 1 arrest by Iranian security officers of 
<br>French citizen Clotilde Reiss (see ref 1). U.S. mainstream 
<br>media have followed suit. Time magazine published a story on 
<br>August 17 that quoted a French diplomat (who wished to remain 
<br>anonymous) describing Syrian President Assad's advocacy as 
<br>vindication of President Sarkozy's 2008 outreach to Syria, 
<br>viewed at the time as premature and unmerited by many critics 
<br>at home and abroad. "There's some genuine (Syrian) gratitude 
<br>at work right now," proclaimed the unnamed diplomat. 
<br>
<br>SYRIAN ACTIONS: THE JURY IS STILL OUT 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) How did Assad's purported gratitude manifest 
<br>itself in this sensitive issue? Despite their laudatory 
<br>pronouncements, French officials claim to have only a vague 
<br>notion of what the Syrians actually did. President Sarkozy's 
<br>Strategic Affairs Advisor Franois Richier told Political 
<br>Minister Counselor on August 11, and again on August 19, that 
<br>when the French released their statement, thanking the 
<br>Syrians, they did not know what message the Syrians might 
<br>have sent to Iran, nor by what channels. MFA Syria Desk 
<br>Officer Patrick Durel on August 18 confirmed that President 
<br>Sarkozy called Syrian President Assad August 5 to ask for his 
<br>assistance in persuading the Iranians to release Clotilde 
<br>Reiss from prison. Assad agreed to raise the matter with the 
<br>Iranians, and shortly thereafter he told Sarkozy that he had 
<br>placed a call to Tehran. Assad did not, however, name his 
<br>interlocutor or interlocutors. "I'm doing what I can to 
<br>help" was the message he sent to Paris, Durel explained. 
<br>
<br>NEW PUBLIC POSTURE FROM ASSAD? 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Richier and Durel suggested that the GOF has 
<br>sought to exaggerate the Syrian role deliberately, in order 
<br>to demonstrate to Syria the praise they might win for playing 
<br>a constructive role in the region, and in order to create 
<br>tension between Syria and Iran. And the French believe they 
<br>have succeeded on both fronts. As a sign that Syrians 
<br>welcomed the praise they received for playing a helpful part 
<br>in Reiss's release, Durel cited the absence of a public 
<br>denial by Assad. In the past, Assad disavowed such activity. 
<br>Durel explained, for instance, that Assad had agreed in 
<br>private during July of 2008 to pass a message from Paris to 
<br>Tehran about the dangers of the Iranian nuclear program, but 
<br>he publicly denied having done so, declaring he did not want 
<br>to play the role of intermediary. Moreover, according to 
<br>Richier, the French believe their reference to Syrian 
<br>intervention has sewn some discomfort among the Iranians, 
<br>whom the French hear from various sources want them to "stop 
<br>this stupid Syria business." In advance of Assad's August 19 
<br>visit to Tehran, the French continued to tout Syria's role 
<br>and encouraged him to raise the issue of Clotilde Reiss's 
<br>still-pending court case. 
<br>
<br>ADVICE ON U.S. HOSTAGES IN IRAN 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Both Richier and MFA Middle East DAS Ludovic 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001162 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>Pouille told us that other countries also sent messages to 
<br>and applied pressure on the Iranians -- most notably, EU 
<br>member states, Qatar and Turkey. It is unclear if Reiss 
<br>would have been freed without such interventions, Pouille 
<br>commented. Richier made the same point, noting that public 
<br>and private messages helped shame and embarrass the Iranian 
<br>regime. He also argued that the French success in painting 
<br>Reiss as simply a young student/teacher with a keen interest 
<br>in and love of Iran proved a key to their success. 
<br>
<br>FRENCH MAKE COMPROMISES TO SECURE RELEASE OF REISS 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Now that Reiss is at the French Embassy in Tehran, 
<br>the GOF plans to decrease their public pronouncements about 
<br>her, according to Richier. In the discussions with the 
<br>Iranians on her release, the French made some concessions to 
<br>Iranian demands, but stayed firm on certain principles. 
<br>Richier said they agreed to pay of bail and to comply with an 
<br>anticipated court order for Reiss to appear at subsequent 
<br>judicial hearings. They also elected not to contest Reiss's 
<br>court-appointed lawyer, but rather to accept him and use him 
<br>to carry messages. On the other hand, they rejected all 
<br>attempts at blackmail or negotiation. Richier confirmed that 
<br>the Iranians did at one point raise the issue of Iranian 
<br>national, Majid Kakavan, to suggest a trade, but the French 
<br>refused. (NOTE: Majid Kakavand is an Iranian national whom 
<br>the French arrested March 20 at Charles de Gaulle airport on 
<br>the behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice on proliferation 
<br>issues (see reftel 2). END NOTE.)
