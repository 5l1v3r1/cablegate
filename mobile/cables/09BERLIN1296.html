<br>SUBJECT: GERMANY COULD HAVE NEW COALITION GOVERNMENT WITHIN 
<br>TWO WEEKS 
<br> 
<br>REF: BERLIN 1271 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor George Glass for reasons 1. 
<br>4 (b,d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C//NF) Summary: A well-placed Free Democratic Party 
<br>(FDP) source told Emboffs October 15 that Chancellor Angela 
<br>Merkel aims to finish coalition negotiations between her 
<br>Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Social Union, and 
<br>the FDP by October 18, but that the FDP viewed a completion 
<br>of October 23 to be more feasible.  Either date would allow 
<br>the parties to hold conventions to approve the agreement 
<br>during the following days and enable the Bundestag to elect 
<br>Angela Merkel Chancellor on October 28, one day after the 
<br>first scheduled meeting of the new Bundestag.  FDP source 
<br>said that in any case, the virtually certain future Foreign 
<br>Minister Guido Westerwelle would want to do the Chancellor 
<br>"the favor" of ensuring her election before her upcoming 
<br>visit to Washington on November 2.  A worst case scenario -- 
<br>and least likely -- is that she would be elected by November 
<br>8, source said, just prior to the November 9 fall of the Wall 
<br>anniversary.  Source provided Emboffs with a list of the 15 
<br>mostly domestic-oriented points included in the FDP campaign 
<br>platform that it wants to see included in the coalition 
<br>agreement, including withdrawal of the remaining 
<br>non-strategic nuclear weapons from German soil, the only one 
<br>addressing foreign policy (reftel).  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C//NF) Source provided Emboffs with a schedule of the 
<br>next days of the coalition negotiations.  The schedule showed 
<br>that the various working groups of the negotiations would 
<br>each report to the plenary (see reftel) October 16-17, with a 
<br>smaller group of the plenary then meeting on October 17 to 
<br>iron out disputed issues and beginning discussions on 
<br>division of the ministerial portfolios between the parties. 
<br>Chancellor Merkel, source said, hopes to wrap up the 
<br>coalition negotiations on October 18 after a full-day plenary 
<br>session, a goal he described as "very ambitious but 
<br>possible."  Source noted that the FDP was not as optimistic 
<br>that a conclusion could be reached as of October 18, and 
<br>scheduled three more plenary sessions for October 21, 22 and 
<br>¶23.  He noted that it is feasible that a coalition agreement 
<br>could be concluded by that date and that the three parties 
<br>would then hold conventions to approve the agreement in the 
<br>days following. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C//NF) This schedule would enable the Bundestag to then 
<br>elect Merkel as Chancellor October 28, the day after its 
<br>first plenary.  Source noted, however, that the FDP has 
<br>alerted the party of three possible  party convention dates: 
<br>October 25 -- if things go as plans, November 1 -- if 
<br>negotiations are prolonged, or November 8 -- worst case 
<br>scenario.  Source said that it would not be "unattractive" 
<br>for Westerwelle to attend the EU Summit October 29-30.  This 
<br>would be a good "debut" for Westerwelle, he added.  In the 
<br>event negotiations are prolonged, source said that 
<br>Westerwelle would like to do the Chancellor "the favor" by 
<br>enabling her to be elected Chancellor before she travels to 
<br>Washington November 2. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C//NF) About the actual negotiations, FDP source 
<br>provided Emboffs with 15 points from their election platform 
<br>that the FDP would like to see included in the coalition 
<br>agreement.  The majority of the 15 points focus on domestic 
<br>economic and social issues, including structural tax reform, 
<br>amendments to the social welfare and pension systems, and 
<br>support for education.  The points also include the goal of 
<br>ending what is termed "unnecessary and ineffective" measures 
<br>to censor the internet and preventing domestic military 
<br>deployments.  The final point, and the only one that concerns 
<br>foreign policy, calls for "entering negotiations with our 
<br>allies" in order to achieve a withdrawal of nuclear weapons 
<br>stationed in Germany during the next legislative term. 
<br>(Note: In response to Emboff questions, source said that the 
<br>goal really is to develop a plan for the withdrawal of the 
<br>nuclear weapons.  End note.)  FDP source said that 
<br>conscription is a disputed issue that is still under 
<br>discussion.  Regarding Turkey's EU membership, FDP source 
<br>said that the FDP would rather not include anything on this 
<br>subject in the agreement, arguing that it will not be at 
<br>issue during the next four years. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C//NF) FDP source assessed that about 85 percent of the 
<br>issues will be decided during this coming weekend.  The FDP 
<br>intends to keep the remaining 15 percent of the issues open 
<br>and use them as bargaining tools for decisions on the 
<br>division of ministerial portfolios.  Regarding portfolios, 
<br>FDP source commented off the record that current Interior 
<br>Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had been trying to serve as the 
<br> 
<br>CDU's "grey eminence,"  seeking to exert influence over many 
<br>of the working groups, beyond his own working group of 
<br>internal security.  Source said that the FDP viewed his role 
<br>negatively, and that he was referred to within the FDP as "an 
<br>angry old man."  He indicated that he hoped the CDU would 
<br>also view his role as counterproductive.  Source, however, 
<br>noted that the agreement will only state which ministerial 
<br>portfolios each party will receive, without providing any 
<br>names.  He stressed that it is up to each party to then 
<br>decide who will fill those positions.
