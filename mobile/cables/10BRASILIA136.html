<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Per REFTEL, Science Counselor briefed Brazilian Ministry of External Relations'(MRE) Environment Division Director Paulino Carvalho (who has replaced Fernando Coimbra) and Officer Renato Leonardi about the U.S. proposals to the March 13-25 Fifteenth Conference of the Parties (COP-15) for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Further, Science Counselor requested the support of the Government of Brazil (GOB) for the U.S. proposals and also asked for information about who will lead the Brazilian delegation and the other delegation members. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Carvalho and Leonardi were well-informed about the CITES issues in REFTEL. They appreciated the sharing of information about the USG proposals, and they inquired about the USG position regarding tuna and CITES. The two reserved opinion about the USG proposals because they wanted to wait till the GOB had completed its inter-ministerial consultations. They expected to have the consultations completed by February 18, when they are scheduled to meet again with the Science Counselor to go over the USG proposals more definitively. At that time, they expect to have decided on the head of the GOB delegation and the other members. Presumably, Carvalho and Leonardi will be part of the delegation to CITES COP-15.
