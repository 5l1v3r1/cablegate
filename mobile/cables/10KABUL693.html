<br>REF: A. (a) KABUL 673
<br>¶B. (b) 09 KABUL 3068
<br>
<br>Classified By: Interagency Provincial Affairs Deputy Director Hoyt Yee
<br>for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) Begin Summary. Senior Civilian
<br>Representative (SCR) Frank Ruggiero met one-on-one with Ahmed
<br>Wali Karzai (AWK) on February 23. SCR informed AWK that
<br>coalition attention will turn to Kandahar in the next phase
<br>of Operation Moshtarak (Together) and the United States will
<br>play a far greater role in Kandahar on the military and
<br>civilian sides. SCR outlined the coalition governance
<br>strategy for Kandahar and cautioned ISAF will seek
<br>non-interference by powerbrokers in police matters. AWK
<br>discussed the recent capture of Taliban leader Mullah Baradar
<br>in Kandahar, district and provincial-level politics, Kandahar
<br>economics and security, the role of xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>narcotics, a southern Pashtoon political party,
<br>competition with Nangarhar Governor Gulaga Sherzai, and AWK's
<br>life in Chicago from 1983-1992. AWK appeared nervous, but
<br>eager to engage with a U.S. official. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Focus on Kandahar
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) SCR told AWK the attention of the
<br>Afghan government, with ISAF support, would turn to Kandahar
<br>in the months ahead and it was likely this would be
<br>predominantly a political contest that would require the
<br>leadership from the highest level of the Afghan government.
<br>SCR discussed the governance strategy for Kandahar City and
<br>surrounding districts. AWK understood the next phase of
<br>operation Moshtarak would be on Kandahar and offered his
<br>support. SCR responded this would be an Afghan
<br>Government-led effort and the coalition would be focusing its
<br>resources on building up that capacity. SCR was clear the
<br>coalition would not tolerate individuals working at odds to
<br>ISAF campaign aims. AWK stated "nobody is that stupid."
<br>
<br>Better Security and Economy in Kandahar
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) AWK told the SCR that security has
<br>improved in Kandahar over the past year. Freedom of movement
<br>had increased across the province, he said, citing his
<br>driving to the meeting at Kandahar Airfield with minimum
<br>security. AWK said insurgents no longer have the capability
<br>to launch large scale attacks; for example, AWK does not fear
<br>an insurgent attack on his home. AWK expressed concern about
<br>a series of assassinations aimed at Afghan officials and
<br>Afghan citizens who work for the coalition in the city,
<br>noting this could only be solved by intelligence assets. AWK
<br>said economic activity had increased in the Kandahar City
<br>area, but noted his belief that President Karzai is largely
<br>unaware of these gains. AWK told the President about
<br>increased economic activity in Arghandab related to AVIPA
<br>Plus and the President was very surprised, he said. AWK said
<br>the President did not understand the changing circumstances
<br>in the province.
<br>
<br>Kandahar Politics Are Local
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) AWK said that it was important to get
<br>district-level tribal dynamics right to bring stability to
<br>Kandahar City and its environs. AWK specifically stated the
<br>need to rely on local, village elders to choose
<br>representatives to district shuras. This would ensure a
<br>representative shura for district level officials, said AWK
<br>and pointed to the succession of Arghandab-based Alikozai
<br>leader Mullah Naqib. AWK said the Alikozais chose Mullah
<br>Naqib's son, Karimullah, to lead the Alikozai. SCR pointed
<br>out coalition conventional wisdom that President Karzai had
<br>interfered in that process to appoint Karimullah, which led
<br>to certain Alikozai elements to support the Taliban in
<br>Arghandab. AWK said, unconvincingly, this was not the case.
<br>AWK then contradicted himself and said Karimullah, in fact,
<br>did not lead the Alikozai, but AWK's deputy at the provincial
<br>council Dastegeeri, was the most influential Alikozai in
<br>Kandahar.
<br>
<br>Police in the South xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) SCR told AWK the coalition would not
<br>accept powerbroker interference with the police and used the
<br>example of citizens in Marjah telling Marines they would not
<br>
<br>Kabul 00000693 002 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>support GIRoA due to past xxxxxxxxxxxx abuses xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>Kandahar does not have similar issues
<br>of interference with the police, he said, but SCR pressed
<br>saying we are aware of a recent incident when the Kandahar
<br>governor sought to remove the Panjwa'i chief of police, but
<br>someone had intervened to halt that removal. AWK, who is
<br>believed to have prevented Governor Weesa from firing the
<br>police chief, said the governor had the power to remove
<br>police officials and should exercise that authority in
<br>Panjwa'i. AWK characterized Governor Weesa as honest and a
<br>powerful figure in Kandahar, but he needed to be more
<br>aggressive. In the same breath, AWK said he was the most
<br>powerful official in Kandahar and could deliver whatever is
<br>needed.
<br>
<br>Capture of Mullah Baradar
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) SCR asked AWK his views on the recent
<br>capture in Pakistan of Taliban leader Mullah Baradar. AWK
<br>said Pakistan detained Baradar and other Taliban leaders
<br>because they were prepared to discuss reintegration with the
<br>Karzai government. Senior Taliban fighters in Pakistan may
<br>be prepared to reintegrate, he said, but are forced by the
<br>Pakistan Government to continue to fight. AWK said some
<br>Afghan Taliban commanders cannot return to Afghanistan
<br>because they are on the Joint Priority Effects List (JPEL)
<br>and are told by the Pakistanis they must continue to fight or
<br>will be turned over to the coalition. It is important to
<br>remove such fighters from the JPEL for reintegration to work,
<br>he argued, adding that he has been working on the
<br>reconciliation issue with the Saudis for two-three years.
<br>AWK offered a meeting with SCR and his older brother and
<br>former Member of Parliament for Kandahar Kayyum Karzai in the
<br>next few weeks to discuss ongoing reintegration discussions
<br>with the Saudis.
<br>
<br>Drug Trafficker: Where is the Polygraph?
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) Unprompted, AWK raised allegations of
<br>his involvement in narcotics, telling the SCR that he is
<br>willing to take a polygraph anytime, anywhere to prove his
<br>innocence and that he has hired an attorney in New York to
<br>clear his name. He suggested that the coalition pay mullahs
<br>to preach against heroin, which would reduce demand for poppy
<br>cultivation. AWK dismissed the narcotics allegations as part
<br>of a campaign to discredit him, particularly by the media,
<br>saying the allegations are "like a spice added to a dish to
<br>make it more enticing to eat."
<br>
<br>A Political Party for Southern Pashtuns?
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) SCR asked AWK if there are discussions
<br>to create a Pashtun-oriented political party in the South.
<br>AWK said such a party would be announced shortly and it would
<br>encompass southern Pashtuns from Herat to Kandahar; Tajiks
<br>also would be represented. AWK said Afghans are reluctant to
<br>join political parties because they are associated with the
<br>communist party and Islamic fundamentalist movements, like
<br>the Taliban. He added that he could not be part of another
<br>election because he had to personally manage promises to
<br>hundreds of thousands of voters in the last election.
<br>
<br>Gulaga Sherzai: Competitor
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) SCR raised the recent 1,500 person
<br>shura co-hosted by AWK and Sherzai in Kandahar City (Reftel
<br>B). AWK said Sherzai was not to be trusted, but he was
<br>willing to work with him on a peace jirga to deliver peace to
<br>the south. AWK passionately presented his history of working
<br>with the United States since 2001 and told the SCR that he
<br>could deliver anything needed.
<br>
<br>Missing Wrigley
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU//Rel NATO, ISAF) Further emphasizing his links to
<br>the United States, AWK fondly recalled his days in Chicago as
<br>a restaurant owner close to Chicago's Wrigley Field. His
<br>
<br>Kabul 00000693 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>restaurant was a hub for American in the Midwest who had
<br>worked or lived in Afghanistan prior to the Soviet invasion,
<br>he said.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶11. (S//Rel NATO, ISAF) AWK was eager to engage and rarely
<br>stopped talking in the two hour meeting. While he presented
<br>himself as a partner to the United States and is eager to be
<br>seen as helping the coalition, he also demonstrated that he
<br>will dissemble when it suits his needs. He appears not to
<br>understand the level of our knowledge of his activities, and
<br>that the coalition views many of his activities as malign,
<br>particularly relating to his influence over the police. We
<br>will need to monitor his activity closely, and deliver a
<br>recurring, transparent message to him of where are redlines
<br>are and what we expect of him in the months ahead.
