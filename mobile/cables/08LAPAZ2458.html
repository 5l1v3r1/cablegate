<br>Classified By: EcoPol Chief Mike Hammer for reasons 1.4 b,d 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: In the days before his November 16 
<br>departure for the United States, where he will speak at the 
<br>OAS and UN and meet with U.S. representatives (Dodd, Lugar, 
<br>Baukus and possibly others), President Evo Morales and his 
<br>closest cabinet advisors lashed out at a wide selection of 
<br>USG targets, claiming that the USG has a strategy of 
<br>supporting a united opposition front against Evo for the 
<br>December 2009 elections. Following the November 1 expulsion 
<br>of DEA, Government Minister Alfredo Rada described the DEA as 
<br>"insignificant" and said, "the world will not end with the 
<br>end of the presence of the DEA." Evo announced that he is 
<br>"after the CIA" last week, and in a November 14 interview the 
<br>state news agency ABI cited Presidency Minister Quintana as 
<br>saying that the "civic prefectural conspiracy" was "fed by 
<br>the empire (the United States), financed by organizations 
<br>that originate in USAID, the CIA, and the DEA." Speaking from 
<br>Venezuela, Quintana added MILGROUP to the mix, saying that 
<br>state security fired on civilians in 2003 (during the riots 
<br>that led to the fall of ex-President Gonzalo "Goni" Sanchez 
<br>de Lozada) because "no state security institution is not 
<br>taught, indoctrinated, and intervened by the DEA, the CIA, 
<br>and by MILGROUP." End summary.

<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) At a November 15 rally in Cochabamba, Morales 
<br>accused the USG of trying to help form an opposition "front" 
<br>to oppose his next presidential run: "I am almost sure, 
<br>sisters and brothers, that the next elections (December 2009 
<br>if the draft constitution passes in January), all the right 
<br>will unite on instructions from the Government of the United 
<br>States." At the same time, Evo reiterated his allegations 
<br>that USAID finances "the opposition". 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Meanwhile, analysts are weighing in on the issue of 
<br>a combined front against Evo, whether comprised solely of the 
<br>"moderate left" (that is, the left without Evo's Movement 
<br>Toward Socialism party) or united with less- conservative 
<br>elements of what is now the conservative opposition party 
<br>Podemos. Former president Carlos Mesa (an oft-mentioned 
<br>contender for leader of the elusive non-Evo front) opined 
<br>recently that "a single front (combining left and right) is 
<br>not viable in the sense that there are very distinct 
<br>ideological positions between which, eventually, there would 
<br>be opposition, but this doesn't eliminate the possibility of 
<br>a front..." 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Comment: Evo's pre-emptive strike against a potential 
<br>opposition front--aligning them without evidence with "the 
<br>empire"--appears to be an effort to set the stage for 
<br>discrediting anyone who runs against him as a U.S. stooge. 
<br>As of now the opposition is far from united, with as many as 
<br>seven potential presidential candidates: former president 
<br>Carlos Mesa, former prefect Manfred Reyes Villa, Tarija 
<br>Prefect Mario Cossio, Potosi Mayor Rene Joaquino, Unidad 
<br>Nacional party leader Samuel Doria Medina, former president 
<br>Tuto Quiroga and even indigenous guerrilla Felipe Quispe. It 
<br>is hard to envision how this disparate group would come 
<br>together, in fact, many of the strategists for potential 
<br>candidates complain to us that other groups and leaders will 
<br>not step aside for the good of the opposition as a whole. End 
<br>comment.

<br>Continued Accusations Against USG Agencies

<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) According to press reports, Minister of Presidency 
<br>Juan Ramon Quintana met in Venezuela on November 14 to 
<br>propose a multilateral "strategic alliance" of governments 
<br>and academics to defend the process of revolutionary change. 
<br>Quintana reminded his audience of Bolivia's recent "torturous 
<br>civic prefectural conspiracy" which he claimed had been "fed 
<br>by the empire (the United States), financed by organizations 
<br>that originate in USAID, the CIA, and the DEA." Back in 
<br>Bolivia, Minister of Government Alfredo Rada was also 
<br>leveling accusations at USG agencies, claiming that the 
<br>Bolivian government must deeply review the actions of 
<br>agencies such as USAID and DEA: "it is a process that demands 
<br>a more-global evaluation to take the decision to normalize 
<br>this relation, and that means new rules of pay, transparency 
<br>in relations and respect for sovereignty." Rada said that 
<br>DEA was welcome to share information in the counternarcotics 
<br>fight, but the DEA is mistaken if it thinks it can "continue 
<br>in the country or will return to the country to continue 
<br>diverting resources of the fight against drugs to work of 
<br>political destabilization or political investigation--that 
<br>can't continue." 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Rada announced on November 16 that the Bolivian 
<br>National Police who worked with DEA will be reviewed and 
<br>those that might have worked "on the margin of the interests 
<br>of the country" will be fired. Rada warned that if "the 
<br>police acted as a foreign embassy in their own institution, 
<br>there will be a separation of these people." He added, "If 
<br>there are police who worked correctly, with good results, you 
<br>can be secure that...they will be able to continue their 
<br>work." 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) From Venezuela, Presidency Minister Quintana added 
<br>new accusations against U.S. agencies, claiming that US 
<br>agencies were behind the 2003 decision of the government of 
<br>then-president Gonzalo "Goni" Sanchez de Lozada to fire on 
<br>civilians. "They consummated the most repugnant genocide in 
<br>Bolivia, which was the genocide of the year 2003, when 
<br>Sanchez de Lozada was expelled from the country. In the face 
<br>of a lack of moderation, in the face of the doubts of the 
<br>high military command to massacre the comrades en El Alto, 
<br>the Military Group (MILGROUP) occupied the highest levels of 
<br>the armed forces and took the decision that the armed forces 
<br>had to massacre the people of El Alto to liberate a caravan 
<br>that had to supply the city of La Paz with fuel. Therefore, 
<br>this is not indirect intervention, this is not interference, 
<br>(it is) direct participation in the genocide of the year 
<br>2003." (Note: Over 60 people were killed in clashes between 
<br>followers of Evo Morales--who had blockaded the capital city 
<br>of La Paz--and government forces. The Morales government has 
<br>repeatedly accused Sanchez de Lozada of genocide and recently 
<br>began processing papers to request the former president's 
<br>extradition. End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Following President Morales' November 11 statement 
<br>that he and the government "are after the CIA too," Vice 
<br>Minister of Social Movements Sacha Llorenti announced on 
<br>November 17 that the presence of CIA agents is "prohibited" 
<br>in Bolivia: "there exists no norm that would allow the 
<br>presence of those agents in the national territory and to 
<br>verify their presence in the country would be a grave action 
<br>against our sovereignty." According to Llorenti, the 
<br>government is investigating the possible presence of 
<br>"external agents or of Bolivians who serve external 
<br>agents....the government is decided, and in this there will 
<br>be no step backwards, on the dignification of our country and 
<br>of its institutions."

<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Morales is already campaigning hard for both the 
<br>constitution and his re-election, as can be seen by his 
<br>standard attacks on the USG. His rhetorical attacks have now 
<br>led to the expulsion of both the Ambassador and the DEA, and 
<br>cannot be ignored as mere campaign stumping. USAID could be 
<br>next, as there have been repeated high-level attacks and 
<br>social-movement calls for its expulsion. Morales' new focus 
<br>on Bolivian "co-conspirators" (either police working with the 
<br>DEA or any political enemy Evo decides to describe as a CIA 
<br>collaborator) will almost certainly instill fear among our 
<br>contacts, who may become more cautious about meeting with us. 
<br>His threat to expel the CIA from Bolivia means that any one 
<br>of us can be (mis)identified as a spy and kicked out should 
<br>we do--or be falsely accused of doing--anything that 
<br>displeases Evo. End comment.
