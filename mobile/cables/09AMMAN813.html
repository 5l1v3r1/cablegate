<br>Classified By: Ambassador R. Stephen Beecroft 
<br>for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S) Summary: This cable responds to Ref A request for 
<br>evaluations of third-country reactions to possible U.S. 
<br>engagement with Iran.  Jordan's leaders believe such 
<br>engagement would reward regional hardliners while undermining 
<br>Arab moderates - without convincing Iran to cease its support 
<br>for terrorism, end its nuclear program or drop its hegemonic 
<br>aspirations.  Jordanian officials argue that the best way to 
<br>counter Iran's ambitions is to weaken the salience of its 
<br>radicalism on the Arab street by fulfilling the promise of a 
<br>"two-state solution," resolving other Arab-Israeli disputes, 
<br>and making sure that Iraq's political and security 
<br>institutions are not overwhelmed by Iranian influence when 
<br>the U.S. drawdown is complete.  If U.S.-Iran engagement does 
<br>proceed in earnest, Jordan hopes to be closely consulted in 
<br>advance and for its interests to be taken into account.  End 
<br>Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Beware the Iranian Tentacles ... and Cut Them Off 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) The metaphor most commonly deployed by Jordanian 
<br>officials when discussing Iran is of an octopus whose 
<br>tentacles reach out insidiously to manipulate, foment, and 
<br>undermine the best laid plans of the West and regional 
<br>moderates.  Iran's tentacles include its allies Qatar and 
<br>Syria, Hizballah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian 
<br>territories, an Iraqi government sometimes seen as supplicant 
<br>to Tehran, and Shia communities throughout the region.  While 
<br>Jordanian officials doubt dialogue with the U.S. will 
<br>convince Iran to withdraw its "tentacles," they believe they 
<br>can be severed if Iran is deprived of hot-button issues that 
<br>make it a hero to many on the Arab street, such as its 
<br>championing of the Palestinian cause. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) According to the GOJ analysis, Iran's influence 
<br>derives from the perception that Tehran is able to "deliver" 
<br>while moderates are not.  The main failure of moderates as 
<br>cited by radicals is ongoing Palestinian suffering and 
<br>dispossession despite an international consensus favoring a 
<br>viable, independent Palestinian state living peacefully next 
<br>to Israel.  The MFA's Deputy Director of the Arab and Middle 
<br>East Affairs Department, Muwaffaq Ajlouni, put it this way: 
<br>"Iran is not welcomed in the Arab world, but it is taking 
<br>advantage of helpless people."  From Jordan's perspective, 
<br>the U.S. would benefit from pressing Israel to proceed to 
<br>final status negotiations, which would garner Arab support to 
<br>deal with shared security concerns about Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) In Lebanon, the GOJ fears Iran's Hizballah proxy has 
<br>been given too much rope and could be poised to increase its 
<br>political influence during upcoming parliamentary elections. 
<br>The King sees the Lebanon-Israel War of 2006 as having 
<br>benefited Iran and Hizballah, by allowing a Sunni Arab street 
<br>enamored of "resistance" to see past its suspicions of the 
<br>Shia.  And then-Foreign Minister Salah Al-Bashir in late 2008 
<br>described the spring 2009 vote as "when we will know who won 
<br>last May," referring to the outcome of the Doha Accords that 
<br>put an end to Lebanese infighting.  Much like with the 
<br>Palestinian issue, Jordanian leaders have argued that the 
<br>only way to pull the rug out from under Hizballah - and by 
<br>extension their Iranian patrons - would be for Israel to hand 
<br>over the disputed Sheba'a Farms to Lebanon.  With Hizballah 
<br>lacking the "resistance to occupation" rationale for 
<br>continued confrontation with Israel, it would lose its raison 
<br>d'etre and probably domestic support. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) In Iraq, signs of growing security and political 
<br>stability over the past year in particular have served 
<br>somewhat to calm Jordanian nerves about Iran's interference. 
<br>The King and others have cited indications that Iraqi Prime 
<br>Minister Nuri Al-Maliki is showing himself to be a national 
<br>rather than a parochial or Iranian-controlled leader.  During 
<br>the U.S.-Jordan Political Dialogue in November 2008, FM 
<br>Bashir noted that the Iraqi government had a "tendency to 
<br>appease Iran," but he saw increased Jordanian (and Sunni 
<br>Arab) diplomatic engagement with Baghdad as a potential 
<br>bulwark against Iran (Ref B).  Positive trends 
<br>notwithstanding, many of our Jordanian interlocutors stress 
<br>that the U.S. should leave Iraq only when it "makes sense," 
<br>and thereby avoid a political and security vacuum that could 
<br>be easily filled by Iran (Ref C). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Prepare for Iran to Disappoint 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S) Jordan's leaders are careful not to be seen as 
<br>dictating toward the U.S., but their comments betray a 
<br>powerful undercurrent of doubt that the United States knows 
<br>how to deal effectively with Iran.  Foreign Minister Nasser 
<br>Joudeh has suggested the Iranians would be happy to let talks 
<br>with the U.S. continue for ten years without moving them 
<br>forward, believing that they can benefit from perceived 
<br>acceptance after years of isolation without paying a price. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S) Upper House President Zeid Rifai has predicted that 
<br>dialogue with Iran will lead nowhere, arguing that if the 
<br>U.S., the EU, and the Arab states agree that under no 
<br>circumstances should Iran be allowed to obtain a nuclear 
<br>weapon, military force becomes the only option.  "Bomb Iran, 
<br>or live with an Iranian bomb.  Sanctions, carrots, incentives 
<br>won't matter," was how he put it to visiting NEA DAS David 
<br>Hale in November.  While Rifai judged a military strike would 
<br>have "catastrophic impact on the region," he nonetheless 
<br>thought preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons would 
<br>pay enough dividends to make it worth the risks (Ref D). 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) Speaking to PolOffs in early February 2009, Director 
<br>of the Prime Minister's Political Office Khaled Al-Qadi noted 
<br>that the Gaza crisis had allowed Iranian interference in 
<br>inter-Arab relations to reach unprecedented levels.  He urged 
<br>the U.S. to "understand the history," explaining that "after 
<br>the Israelis, the Iranians are the smartest.  They know where 
<br>they are going and what they are doing."  He doubted there 
<br>would be any diplomatic breakthrough before Iran's June 
<br>elections, partly because Iranian pragmatists cannot be 
<br>practical due to religious and ideological considerations. 
<br>He hoped any dialogue would be aimed at weakening hardliners, 
<br>many of whom believe their "Great Satan" rhetoric. 
<br> 
<br>Talk If You Must, But Don't Sell Us Out 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S) If direct U.S.-Iran talks must happen, the Jordanian 
<br>leadership insists it not be at the expense of Arab 
<br>interests, particularly those of moderates like Jordan, 
<br>Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. 
<br> Furthermore, they worry that engagement will set off a 
<br>stampede of Arab states looking to get ahead of the curve and 
<br>reach their own separate peace with Tehran.  King Abdullah 
<br>counseled Special Envoy George Mitchell in February that 
<br>direct U.S. engagement with Iran at this time would just 
<br>deepen intra-Arab schisms and that more "countries without a 
<br>backbone" would defect to the Iranian camp.  The Prime 
<br>Ministry's Qadi has assessed that Iran sought to "transform 
<br>the Israeli-Arab conflict into an Islamic-Israeli conflict" 
<br>and that this strategy was already working with Syria and 
<br>Qatar.  Even more conspiratorially, then-FM Bashir in 
<br>September 2008 highlighed Arab fears to a visiting CODEL that 
<br>the United States and the West would allow Iran to play a 
<br>hegemonic role in Iraq and throughout the region in exchange 
<br>for giving up its nuclear program (Ref E). 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (S) Asked late last year whether he advocated engaging 
<br>Iran or working against its interests without engagement, the 
<br>King told visiting U.S. Senators that U.S. should undertake 
<br>both approaches concurrently but that engagement needs to be 
<br>done "smartly" by setting benchmarks for behavior (Ref F). 
<br>International Affairs Director at the Royal Court Jafar 
<br>Hassan on April 1 operationalized Jordan's position as 
<br>follows: the U.S. must not only consult its friends in the 
<br>region, but declare that it is doing so publicly as a signal 
<br>to Iran that the Arabs are full parties to the U.S. policy 
<br>review.  He called for the U.S. and the Arabs to work 
<br>together to determine what deliverables are required from 
<br>Iran, what subjects are appropriate for discussion, and also 
<br>to set clear redlines.  (Note: Hassan said Jordan was trying 
<br>to work with its friends in the region to develop a 
<br>joint-Arab strategy, but that this has yet to materialize. 
<br>End Note.) 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (S) Comment: Believing the U.S. is predisposed toward 
<br>engagement with Iran, Jordanian officials have avoided 
<br>forthrightly rejecting such overtures, but they remain 
<br>anxious that Iran will be the only one to benefit - at their 
<br>expense.  Given Jordanian skepticism that Iran's regional 
<br>ambitions can be reined in, they probably see establishing 
<br>benchmarks as a way to keep U.S.-Iranian engagement limited 
<br>and short-lived.  Re-engagement could trigger a review of 
<br>Jordan's relationship with Iran and with Islamic groups like 
<br>Hamas, with which Jordan held limited security talks last 
<br>year.  When asked periodically whether by engaging with 
<br>Hamas, Jordan was undermining PA President Mahmoud Abbas, 
<br> 
<br>official interlocutors simply pointed out that Israel meets 
<br>with Hamas through Egypt, that Syria and Iran are actively 
<br>engaged with Hamas, and that Jordan cannot be disengaged. 
<br>End Comment.
