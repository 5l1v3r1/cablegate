<br>SUBJECT: INDIGENOUS RIGHTS, SOCIAL ISSUES, ENERGY SHORTAGES
<br>ON MIND OF SEGPRES MINISTER
<br>
<br>Classified By: E/Pol Counselor Juan A. Alsace for reasons 1.5 (b) and (
<br>d).
<br>
<br>------
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Secretariat General of the Presidency Minister Viera
<br>Gallo told the Ambassador January 30 that the GOC - and
<br>Chilean society - are only belatedly taking seriously a
<br>growing problem with Chile's indigenous (largely Mapuche)
<br>population, which has never been fully integrated and is
<br>becoming increasingly radicalized. Mapuche alienation and
<br>protest activity could impact on issues such as terrorism,
<br>energy, and development in environmentally sensitive regions.
<br>Chile's energy shortage was the country's "biggest problem"
<br>in the near term, although Chile was also struggling with
<br>issues arising out of modernization and globalization, with
<br>youth and women seeking their place in an evolving Chilean
<br>society. End summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Ambassador Simons paid a courtesy call January 30 on
<br>Minister of the Secretariat General of the Presidency
<br>(SEGPRES) Jose Antonio Viera-Gallo, whose ministry is
<br>responsible for coordinating relations between the Presidency
<br>and three sets of key political actors: the four parties of
<br>the center-left governing Concertacion coalition, the
<br>center-right opposition, and the Congress. The Ambassador
<br>was accompanied by E/Pol Counselor.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>An Increasingly Vocal Indigenous Population
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) After opening pleasantries - Viera Gallo noted that
<br>since Chile's return to democracy relations with the U.S.
<br>have been very good across the board - the Minister was
<br>briefly interrupted by two phone calls. The second was from
<br>President Bachelet and the short conversation (topic unclear)
<br>was notable for its formality, with no apparent warmth,
<br>(Comment: This tracks with the common view that Veira-Gallo,
<br>a political operative, was brought into the cabinet as a
<br>"fixer" and not because he is in Bachelet's inner circle.)
<br>The first call was from Archbishop Goic, who has been serving
<br>as an intermediary between the GOC and hunger-striker
<br>Patricia Troncoso, who has been protesting her incarceration,
<br>the result of her involvement in the torching of a rural
<br>farm, located on land that the Mapuche indigenous population
<br>claim was stolen from them. The accord has been front page
<br>news and the government has taken some heat for bowing to
<br>Troncoso's demands, but also for failing to take seriously
<br>the "Mapuche issue." As a result, Bachelet recently named a
<br>"Presidential Commissioner" to head a panel to review how the
<br>GOC is dealing with the long-simmering complaints of the
<br>indigenous population (septel).
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Viera-Gallo agreed with E/Pol Counselor that the issue
<br>cut across several lines, including terrorism, energy, and
<br>development. The Minister noted that several Mapuche had
<br>ties to the Basques, including possibly to the ETA. They are
<br>involved in protests against construction of dams that would
<br>produce hydro-electric power, impacting Chile's energy needs.
<br>Mapuche are linked to NGO's opposed to development in lands
<br>both claimed by the Mapuche and which are also
<br>environmentally sensitive. Nonetheless, Viera-Gallo
<br>continued, the Mapuche have legitimate concerns. Both
<br>moderates and extremists, with some justification, view
<br>themselves as having been "mistreated by Chile." While
<br>essentially a conservative people ("they vote for the right")
<br>they also have respect for the environment and are a
<br>matriarchical society. Many are well-educated with strong
<br>ties to similar indigenous or ethnic groups, including in
<br>Europe. There is developing a significant divide between
<br>young, more radical Mapuche, and older leaders who have
<br>demands but will accept accommodation within the Chilean
<br>state. The younger leadership seeks a separate Mapuche
<br>entity.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Viera-Gallo, who clearly evidenced sympathy for the
<br>Mapuche, said they had not been integrated "at all" into
<br>Chilean society. Chileans, especially the upper class which
<br>identifies with Chile's European pretensions, have to accept
<br>that the Mapuche, and other smaller indigenous groups, are
<br>also a part of Chile's make-up. The Mapuche have have made
<br>some inroads in this respect, reaching out successfully to
<br>younger non-Mapuche Chileans sympathetic to their cause. The
<br>Catholic Church is also increasingly involved with indigenous
<br>concerns.
<br>
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>An Energy Deficit
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Viera-Gallo didn't hesitate when asked by the
<br>Ambassador to enumerate the administration's challenges:
<br>"Energy is our biggest problem." Domestic production and
<br>supply from outside sources, such as Argentina, have not kept
<br>pace with surging economic growth. Chile will face "serious
<br>restrictions" in the upcoming winter months. Construction of
<br>dams (hydro) is critical but faces obstacles from indigenous
<br>and environmental groups. The potential for developing
<br>geothermal power in Chile's north ("we are talking to the
<br>Italians") is also hostage to indigenous groups in that
<br>region, who are concerned about associated water rights and
<br>shortages. Viera-Gallo said prospects would improve in 2009,
<br>when LNG plant facilities would come on line. The Ambassador
<br>noted that President Bachelet had asked him, at presentation
<br>of credentials, to find ways to enhance U.S.-Chile
<br>cooperation on energy. He had met across a wide range of
<br>private and public energy experts and policymakers during his
<br>first six weeks in country and would return to Washington in
<br>February to work on next steps.
<br>
<br>------------------------------
<br>The Challenge of Modernization
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Turning to other challenges facing Chile, a
<br>reflective Viera-Gallo worried about disaffected youth
<br>disengaged from politics, "fatigued" with parliament and
<br>political parties, although he stressed this was not yet a
<br>crisis. Still, Chileans generally were dealing with the
<br>cultural dislocations attendant on modernization, including
<br>rampant consumerism ("the mall culture") and a sense that
<br>life was overly complicated. Yet all Chileans felt they they
<br>had to adapt and keep up, he continued, noting that in his
<br>visits to rural areas, he was struck by the modern appliances
<br>found even in the most humble homes. Educational levels were
<br>on the increase with more college students, but job prospects
<br>for those with university degrees poor ("PhD's driving
<br>taxis"). Women are also facing change; as they are
<br>increasingly educated they are leaving rural areas behind,
<br>seeking jobs in urban areas. Chile is also welcoming foreign
<br>labor for the first time in its history, with large numbers
<br>of Peruvians entering the agricultural labor force. These
<br>changes are fearful for many in Chilean society. The
<br>Ambassador noted that U.S. society continues to face many of
<br>the same challenges Viera-Gallo had outlined.
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>HDTV, IPR, Loss of Majority
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) The Ambassador noted pending intellectual property
<br>legislation in the Chilean Senate, adding that the Embassy
<br>continued to work closely with the GOC and USTR to find ways
<br>to address our concerns with the proposed law. He also made
<br>a pitch for ATSC, the U.S.-backed digital television
<br>standard, noting the lower cost for Chilean consumers.
<br>Viera-Gallo agreed it was important for the GOC to make the
<br>right choice on digital TV. Asked whether the loss of the
<br>governing coalition's working majority in both houses of
<br>parliament would affect the administration's ability to
<br>pursue its agenda, Viera-Gallo shrugged: "It's not really a
<br>problem; Concertacion has rarely had a majority but still
<br>worked solutions."
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Bio Note: Viera-Gallo said he had two daughters
<br>living in Brooklyn. The first, thirty years old, is an
<br>artist, married to an architect. She has a studio and has
<br>exhibited in New York, Los Angeles, and Chile. The second,
<br>younger, is a writer, recently divorced from a well known
<br>Chilean artist (Ivan Navarro) who, Viera-Gallo lamented
<br>jokingly, is "making it big" after the divorce.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) That much of the meeting was devoted to the Mapuche
<br>issue is evidence that Chile, which has long ignored its
<br>indigenous population, cannot escape dealing with yet another
<br>offshoot of globalization, in this case the rising awareness
<br>of the Mapuche that their concerns are similar to those of
<br>other indigenous or ethnic minority groups, are at least as
<br>legitimate, and need be addressed by the government. The
<br>danger lies in radicalization of the issue, potential ties to
<br>extremist or even terrorist groups, and the use of violence
<br>to push an agenda. Post will be following this issue closely
<br>in the near term, including proposing how the USG might be of
<br>
<br>assistance to the GOC both through intelligence sharing but
<br>also promoting dialogue and finding solutions. End comment.
