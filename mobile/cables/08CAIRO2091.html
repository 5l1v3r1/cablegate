<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Recently, academics and civilian analysts 
<br>painted a portrait of an Egyptian military in intellectual 
<br>and social decline, whose officers have largely fallen out of 
<br>society's elite ranks. They describe a disgruntled mid-level 
<br>officer corps harshly critical of a defense minister they 
<br>perceive as incompetent and valuing loyalty above skill in 
<br>his subordinates. However, analysts perceive the military as 
<br>retaining strong influence through its role in ensuring 
<br>regime stability and operating a large network of commercial 
<br>enterprises. Regarding succession, analysts highlight the 
<br>armed forces' uneasiness with Gamal Mubarak, but largely 
<br>agree that the military would support Gamal if President 
<br>Mubarak resigns and installs him in the presidency, a 
<br>scenario we view as unlikely. One professor opined that 
<br>since 2003, the regime has tried to strengthen the economic 
<br>elite close to Gamal at the expense of the military in an 
<br>effort to weaken potential military opposition to Gamal's 
<br>path to the presidency. Other analysts believe the regime is 
<br>trying to co-opt the military through patronage into 
<br>accepting Gamal and that despite tensions between the 
<br>military and business, their relationship remains 
<br>cooperative. End summary. 
<br>
<br>------------------------- 
<br>An Institution in Decline 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) A series of recent conversations with academics and 
<br>other civilian analysts reveals their sense that while 
<br>Egypt's military is in decline, it nevertheless remains a 
<br>powerful institution. (Note: These academics' expertise in 
<br>Egyptian politics and willingness to comment on the sensitive 
<br>issue of the military's current role makes them valuable 
<br>interlocutors for us. End note.) An American University in 
<br>Cairo (AUC) political science professor with family ties to 
<br>the officer corps told us that the military reached its peak 
<br>of influence in the late 1980's before the ouster of the 
<br>recently deceased former Defense Minister Abu Ghazalah, who 
<br>was dismissed because of his growing political popularity. 
<br>He asserted that since 1989, the MOD's influence in Egyptian 
<br>society has been gradually waning, and the privileged social 
<br>position of its elite members has been in decline as 
<br>society's respect for the military fades. One 
<br>political-military analyst at the GOE-funded Al-Ahram Center 
<br>who is a retired general noted that military salaries have 
<br>fallen far below what is available in the private sector, and 
<br>that a military career is no longer an attractive option for 
<br>ambitious young people who aspire to join the new business 
<br>elite instead. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) A senior Cairo University political science professor 
<br>opined that before the 1967 war, military officers were 
<br>"spoiled," and constituted a social elite. Following the 
<br>military's poor performance in the 1967 war, he said, 
<br>officers began a descent out of the upper ranks of society 
<br>that accelerated after Abu Ghazalah's ouster in 1989. Since 
<br>Abu Ghazalah, a senior AUC political science professor noted, 
<br>the regime has not allowed any charismatic figures to reach 
<br>the senior ranks. "(Defense Minister) Tantawi looks like a 
<br>bureaucrat," he joked. The AUC professor described the 
<br>mid-level officer corps as generally disgruntled, and said 
<br>that one can hear mid-level officers at MOD clubs around 
<br>Cairo openly expressing disdain for Tantawi. These officers 
<br>refer to Tantawi as "Mubarak's poodle," he said, and complain 
<br>that "this incompetent Defense Minister" who reached his 
<br>position only because of unwavering loyalty to Mubarak is 
<br>"running the military into the ground." He opined that a 
<br>culture of blind obedience pervades the MOD where the sole 
<br>criteria for promotion is loyalty, and that the MOD 
<br>leadership does not hesitate to fire officers it perceives as 
<br>being "too competent" and who therefore potentially pose a 
<br>threat to the regime. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) A political-military analyst with an academic 
<br>background at the GOE-funded Al-Ahram Center believes that 
<br>the government's increasing opposition to dialogue with 
<br>academia is symptomatic of its social and intellectual 
<br>decline. He said that up until 6 years ago, the MOD had 
<br>
<br>assigned a military representative to the Al-Ahram Center to 
<br>participate in academic discussions; subsequently, the MOD 
<br>jailed the representative because his views were becoming too 
<br>independent, and has not sent a replacement to the center. 
<br>He claimed that Tantawi has become increasingly intolerant of 
<br>intellectual freedom and in 2006 refused to allow the 
<br>Al-Ahram Center to pursue a research project with the Royal 
<br>Dutch Military Society on military reform in Egypt and 
<br>Holland. In his view, Tantawi has made clear that the 
<br>military is "off-limits" as a subject for academic research, 
<br>and that the MOD will not tolerate independent thought within 
<br>its own ranks. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>...But Still Retaining Economic Clout For Now 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Although analysts see a small number of regime and 
<br>business elites exercising increasing political and economic 
<br>control over the country, they acknowledge the military's 
<br>strong influence in Egypt's economy. A senior AUC 
<br>political-science professor opined that the regime gives the 
<br>six businessmen in the cabinet carte blanche to pursue 
<br>commercial activities, but that the defense minister can put 
<br>a hold on any contract for "security concerns." Contacts 
<br>told us that military-owned companies, often run by retired 
<br>generals, are particularly active in the water, olive oil, 
<br>cement, construction, hotel and gasoline industries. The 
<br>senior Cairo University professor pointed out that military 
<br>companies built the modern road to the Ain Souknah Red Sea 
<br>resorts 90 minutes from Cairo and Cairo University's new 
<br>annex. He noted the large amounts of land owned by the 
<br>military in the Nile Delta and on the Red Sea coast, 
<br>speculating that such property is a "fringe benefit" in 
<br>exchange for the military ensuring regime stability and 
<br>security. (Comment: We see the military's role in the 
<br>economy as a force that generally stifles free market reform 
<br>by increasing direct government involvement in the markets. 
<br>End comment.) 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Most analysts agreed that the military views the GOE's 
<br>privatization efforts as a threat to its economic position, 
<br>and therefore generally opposes economic reforms. The senior 
<br>Cairo University professor speculated that privatization has 
<br>forced military-owned companies to improve the quality of 
<br>their work, specifically in the hotel industry, to compete 
<br>with private firms and attract critical foreign investment. 
<br>One of the Al-Ahram Center political-military analysts 
<br>predicted that the growing power of the economic elite at the 
<br>military's expense is inevitable as economic necessity drives 
<br>the government to maintain its economic reform policies in 
<br>order to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). He said 
<br>that FDI is essential to the government's plans to maintain 
<br>economic growth and political stability. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>Influence in the Bureaucracy and Civil Society 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The senior Cairo University professor pointed to a 
<br>"concerted effort" from the "top of the regime" to penetrate 
<br>the civilian bureaucracy with retired senior military 
<br>officers. He highlighted retired officers filling top 
<br>civilian jobs, such as governors, and chief of staff 
<br>positions and other senior slots at the Information, 
<br>Transportation and Education ministries. Other contacts 
<br>noted their anecdotal experience with military officers 
<br>running civil society organizations and charities. The 
<br>senior AUC political science professor remarked that a 
<br>literacy campaign in his neighborhood recently hired a 
<br>retired military officer to run its operations. He told us 
<br>that the local charitable society where his wife volunteers 
<br>recently hired a retired general as its director, believing 
<br>that the general's competence, experience with bureaucracies, 
<br>and network of colleagues and contacts in the ministries 
<br>would serve the charity well. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>The Military and Succession 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Contacts agree that presidential son Gamal Mubarak's 
<br>power base is centered in the business community, not with 
<br>the military. The senior Cairo University political science 
<br>professor said officers told him recently that the military 
<br>
<br>does not support Gamal and if Mubarak died in office, the 
<br>military would seize power rather than allow Gamal to succeed 
<br>his father. However, analysts agreed that the military would 
<br>allow Gamal to take power through an election if President 
<br>Mubarak blessed the process and effectively gave Gamal the 
<br>reigns of power. The AUC junior political science professor 
<br>opined that after Gamal became active in the NDP in 2002, the 
<br>regime empowered the reformers in the 2004 cabinet to begin 
<br>privatization efforts that buttressed the wealthy businessmen 
<br>close to Gamal. In his estimation, the regime's goal is to 
<br>create a business-centered power base for Gamal in the NDP to 
<br>compensate for his lack of military credentials. A necessary 
<br>corollary to this strategy, he claimed, was for the regime to 
<br>weaken the military's economic and political power so that it 
<br>cannot block Gamal's path to the presidency. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Comment: The military still remains a potent 
<br>political and economic force. Its recent interventions, 
<br>using the MOD's considerable resources, to produce bread to 
<br>meet shortages in March and extinguish the Shoura Council 
<br>fire in August (refs A and B) demonstrate that it sometimes 
<br>can successfully step in where other government agencies 
<br>fail. The military helps to ensure regime stability and 
<br>operates a large network of businesses as it becomes a 
<br>"quasi-commercial" enterprise itself. While there are 
<br>economic and political tensions between the business elite 
<br>and the military, the overall relationship between the two 
<br>still appears to be cooperative, rather than adversarial. 
<br>The military's loss of some prestige is partly due to the 
<br>disappearance of an imminent, external military threat 
<br>following the 1979 Camp David Accords. The regime, aware of 
<br>the critical role the MOD can play in presidential 
<br>succession, may well be trying to co-opt the military through 
<br>patronage into accepting Gamal's path to the presidency. We 
<br>agree with the analysis that senior military officers would 
<br>support Gamal if Mubarak resigned and installed him in the 
<br>presidency, as it is difficult to imagine opposition from 
<br>these officers who depend on the president and defense 
<br>minister for their jobs and material perks. In a messier 
<br>succession scenario, however, it becomes more difficult to 
<br>predict the military's actions. While mid-level officers do 
<br>not necessarily share their superiors' fealty to the regime, 
<br>the military's built-in firewalls and communication breaks 
<br>make it unlikely that these officers could independently 
<br>install a new leader.
