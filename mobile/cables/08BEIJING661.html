<br>
<br>Classified by Ambassador Clark T. Randt, Jr. Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) The United States and China share important and growing 
<br>political and economic interests that will bind us indefinitely, 
<br>despite frictions. Where interests vary or compete, we share a 
<br>common interest in managing our differences. In the medium term, 
<br>China's core foreign policy goals -- securing access to energy 
<br>supplies and maintaining a stable international environment in order 
<br>to pursue domestic economic development -- will keep China as a 
<br>status quo power. Over time, China's growing strength will lead to a 
<br>foreign policy more willing to confront the United States but also 
<br>better able to take up the responsibilities of a global stakeholder. 
<br>China will continue to demand more from the United States on Taiwan 
<br>than we are willing to give, and Taiwan will remain a potential 
<br>flashpoint. As we face an increasingly self-confident and powerful 
<br>China, we can and should continue to use bilateral policy 
<br>instruments, including high-level engagement (such as the Senior 
<br>Dialogue and Strategic Economic Dialogue), China's multilateral 
<br>commitments, and the Chinese desire to build its international image 
<br>and standing to protect U.S. interests, spur positive change in China 
<br>and increase Beijing's stake in international institutions and its 
<br>adherence to international norms. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>ECONOMIC TIES THAT BIND 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The United States and China share enormous economic interests. 
<br>China is the top U.S. trade partner outside of North America, and 
<br>public and private sector analysts agree that China's share of our 
<br>trade will continue to rise. Exports have been a primary driver of 
<br>China's growth. Export-oriented employment, along with technology 
<br>transfers and other indirect benefits of foreign investment and 
<br>trade, are major ingredients of China's economic miracle. Similarly, 
<br>low inflation and strong growth in the United States over the last 
<br>two decades stem in part from low-cost Chinese imports and financial 
<br>inflows. It is in the interests of both the United States and China 
<br>to maintain the benefits created by our complementary economies while 
<br>correcting current imbalances by continuing to pressure China to open 
<br>markets, particularly in the service sector, and to significantly 
<br>improve the protection of intellectual property rights. At the same 
<br>time, frictions need to be managed carefully to avoid harming our 
<br>common economic interests. 
<br>
<br>POLITICAL COOPERATION 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Shared overall U.S.-China interests in peace, security and 
<br>prosperity likewise are dogged by frictions. Differences over 
<br>values, political systems, specific goals and means will continue. 
<br>The list of areas of political and security friction is long and 
<br>includes China's authoritarian political system, China's support for 
<br>unsavory regimes, China's breakneck military modernization, China's 
<br>paranoid fear that the United States secretly promotes regime change 
<br>and "separatists" in Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang, growing nationalism 
<br>and the sense in some quarters in both Washington and Beijing that 
<br>the United States and China are commencing a long-term struggle for 
<br>global political, economic and military supremacy. Countering these 
<br>differences is the buildup of mutual trust between the U.S. and 
<br>Chinese leadership and the willingness to work together in an 
<br>increasingly broad spectrum of common strategic interests. China's 
<br>realization of its own interest in a stable, non-nuclear Korean 
<br>Peninsula and frustration with an inept North Korean leadership 
<br>seemingly incapable of creating an economy that can sustainably 
<br>support its own people, leading to constant refugee outflows, has led 
<br>to close cooperation with the United States in the Six-Party Talks. 
<br>The evolution in China's position on Darfur, driven by the 
<br>Olympics-related international publicity concerning China's role in 
<br>abetting genocide, shows that extreme diplomatic and public pressure 
<br>can redirect Chinese policy to a degree. China's cooperation on 
<br>Burma and Iran has been grudging and limited, but real. We have been 
<br>able to leverage China's growing interdependence and concern for its 
<br>global public image into support for multilateral actions that 
<br>further U.S. goals. 
<br>
<br>FAMILIARITY BREEDS FRICTION 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The expanding breadth, scale and intensity of U.S.-China 
<br>engagement bring additional opportunities for friction as well as 
<br>cooperation. China's gradual approach to exchange rate flexibility, 
<br>slowness on further trade liberalization, weak IPR protection and 
<br>other barriers to trade and investment require constant attention. 
<br>China's perception that U.S. assertiveness on WTO commitments, import 
<br>regulation, investment cases and product safety is discriminatory 
<br>requires education and explanation. Such frictions could become more 
<br>acute should the economy worsen, protectionism rise, or sensitivity 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00000661 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>over foreign investment sharpen in either country. Politically, 
<br>differing assessments on the urgency of issues like Iran's nuclear 
<br>program and appropriate tactics to realize shared strategic goals 
<br>will mean China and the United States continue to butt heads 
<br>diplomatically. Divergent views on democracy and human rights will 
<br>continue to be a sore point in the bilateral relationship. Managing 
<br>day-to-day frictions with an eye to larger interests will be the 
<br>greatest challenge for policy-makers. 
<br>
<br>RHETORIC: STRATEGIC REBALANCING 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) China's rise and emergence as a global power is a powerful and 
<br>popular theme in Chinese contemporary culture, with hundreds of 
<br>books, major TV series, countless media articles and academic studies 
<br>devoted to it. Official public statements on foreign policy stress 
<br>"democratization of international relations" and a more "multi-polar" 
<br>world, contrasted with U.S. "unilateralism." Many scholars, 
<br>officials and ordinary citizens believe China's past weakness has 
<br>forced it to endure "injustices" from the United States, like the 
<br>Taiwan Relations Act and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and Chinese have 
<br>no trouble linking these injustices to a centuries-long string of 
<br>humiliations China perceives itself as having suffered at the hands 
<br>of foreign powers. MFA officials often complain informally (and 
<br>unfairly) that the United States demands China address U.S. concerns 
<br>while ignoring China's concerns. As China's international presence 
<br>and nationalist sentiment grow, commensurate with greater political, 
<br>economic and military might, Chinese analysts anticipate a more 
<br>assertive Chinese foreign policy and a greater readiness to confront 
<br>the United States. 
<br>
<br>REALITY: STATUS QUO POWER 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Despite the flag-waving "rising China" theme in popular 
<br>culture and official media promising a more assertive Chinese 
<br>international stance, the reality of China's foreign policy for at 
<br>least the next five years is that China is committed to the 
<br>international status quo as it reaps the benefits of U.S.-policed 
<br>globalization. President Hu's "Harmonious World" foreign policy, 
<br>officially sanctified at the 17th Party Congress in October, 
<br>explicitly endorses the existing world order and declares that 
<br>China's interest is in maintaining a stable international environment 
<br>where it can pursue domestic economic and social development goals. 
<br>China's foreign policy leaders take great pains to highlight China's 
<br>"developing country" status as a way to offset international calls 
<br>for China to play a more significant international role, and to 
<br>expend more material and political resources, commensurate with its 
<br>"emerging power" status. In January, Executive Vice Foreign Minister 
<br>Dai Bingguo held the fifth session of the U.S.-China Senior Dialogue 
<br>in his poor rural home province of Guizhou rather than Beijing to 
<br>make the point that China remains poor and is confronted with 
<br>economic development challenges on a large scale. Continued access 
<br>to energy supplies and raw materials on the international market is 
<br>essential to China's continued economic growth, which means continued 
<br>reliance on global peace and stability and the existing global 
<br>security system to protect such shipments. As XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> told XXXXXXXXXXXX, "when it comes to the basic Chines
<br> interest in securing  energy supplies and raw materials for our
<br>economic growth,  free-riderism works for us right now." 
<br>
<br>
<br>IRRESPONSIBLE STAKEHOLDER? 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Internal debate continues in China regarding its appropriate 
<br>international role. Some foreign policy figures argue China should 
<br>seize opportunities to lead on global issues like climate change, 
<br>nonproliferation and mediation of international disputes. Contacts 
<br>have said these remarks reflect internal government debates on 
<br>balancing global with purely national interests. The feeling in 
<br>China that China remains too poor and underdeveloped to be much of a 
<br>global stakeholder remains strong, although it would appear that 
<br>China's standard of "developed" is increasingly the United States. 
<br>One academic said, "the United States still reaps almost all of the 
<br>benefits of 'international public goods' and should expect to bear 
<br>almost all of the costs." This argument, along with the frequent 
<br>pious invocation of "non-interference in internal affairs" provides a 
<br>thin political justification for China's fundamentally mercantile 
<br>pursuit of resources in Burma, Iran, Sudan and other pariah states. 
<br>The tension between China's long-term, broad global interests and its 
<br>short-term, naked national interests will persist in Chinese foreign 
<br>policy for some time. So far, public opinion has been the most 
<br>effective tool in blunting the Chinese effort to profit from its 
<br>rogue-state relationships. The Chinese want to build an 
<br>international image as a responsible power and are sensitive to 
<br>accusations that they facilitate the abuses of rogue regimes. The 
<br>Chinese cooperation on Darfur after international outcry began to 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00000661 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>threaten another core interest (a successful Olympics) demonstrates 
<br>how public opinion can provide effective motivation. 
<br>
<br>ACTIVISM VS. NON-INTERFERENCE 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Part of the debate over China's role as stakeholder stems from 
<br>differing views on China's long-standing, expedient policy of 
<br>"non-interference." Since the beginning of the reform era, China has 
<br>generally followed Deng Xiaoping's advice to maintain a low profile 
<br>and focus on its own development. In this spirit, China's pledge of 
<br>"non-interference" in other nations' affairs became a pillar of 
<br>China's declared foreign policy. More recently, some have viewed 
<br>President Hu Jintao's trademark "Harmonious World" policy as a subtle 
<br>renunciation of non-interference that acknowledges the need for China 
<br>to be engaged in a globalized world. One prominent foreign policy 
<br>expert told us that while China is still "feeling its way" on an 
<br>activist foreign policy, Beijing will continue to move toward greater 
<br>engagement and less "non-interference." XXXXXXXXXXXX said
<br>more bluntly that China's non-interference policy "has  always been
<br>flexible" and that China is comfortable in an activist  role whe
<br> it wants to be. 
<br>
<br>HUMAN RIGHTS 
<br>------------ 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) As economic success increases China's confidence that China 
<br>can develop without Western-style democracy, resistance to U.S. 
<br>promotion of human rights may intensify. At the same time, Chinese 
<br>leaders see the utility of a limited expansion of civil society, 
<br>including improvements in the rule of law and a stronger role for 
<br>approved religions, NGOs, charities and other actors in areas that 
<br>contribute to social stability and do not challenge Communist Party 
<br>rule. China is open to U.S. experience in these areas, though 
<br>Chinese leaders will tolerate only slow and limited change. In areas 
<br>such as Tibet and Xinjiang, the fear of separatism leads to tighter 
<br>restrictions on the growth of civil society. We should continue to 
<br>press the Chinese to resume our formal human rights dialogue to 
<br>provide a bilateral channel for a regular, high-level exchange of 
<br>views. In such discussions, we should continue to express our 
<br>serious concerns over Beijing's human rights record and appeal to 
<br>China's growing awareness that greater respect for human rights, 
<br>religious freedom and the rule of law will serve to promote the very 
<br>development and social stability that China seeks as well as to 
<br>improve China's international image. 
<br>
<br>THE ROLE OF SOFT POWER 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) China actively pursues educational exchanges, cultural 
<br>performances, youth exchanges and other instruments of "soft power." 
<br>Development assistance to resource-rich nations has also grown and 
<br>remains generally without conditions (except with respect to the 
<br>Taiwan issue). China is also making attempts to break into what it 
<br>sees as an undesirable Western, and specifically American, monopoly 
<br>of the international news media and to offer an alternative to 
<br>ubiquitous American popular culture. Soft power is a useful arrow in 
<br>the Chinese foreign policy quiver but should not be overestimated. 
<br>Chinese culture tends toward exceptionalism rather than universality; 
<br>i.e., many things about Chinese culture, in the Chinese view, are 
<br>appropriate (or even intelligible) to Chinese alone. Moreover, China 
<br>senses that its traditional low profile and attempts not to be seen 
<br>as competing with the values and political systems of other countries 
<br>are part of its attractiveness. The Chinese acknowledge both the 
<br>limits of soft power and that China's reliance on soft power is in 
<br>large measure due to the fact that China, in the near-term, lacks 
<br>hard power. 
<br>
<br>TAIWAN 
<br>------ 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) China has long identified Taiwan as one of its core 
<br>interests. Chinese leaders see preventing Taiwan's formal 
<br>independence as crucial to their legitimacy, and the United States is 
<br>committed to the defense of the status quo absent agreement to a 
<br>change by the peoples on both sides of the Strait. Taiwan will 
<br>continue to be the largest threat to U.S.-China relations, 
<br>potentially resulting in armed conflict. Though China always wants 
<br>more, for the past two years Chinese leaders have appeared relatively 
<br>satisfied with and even appreciative of U.S. policy toward Taiwan, 
<br>despite rhetoric to the contrary. U.S. disaffection with Chen 
<br>Shui-bian and explicit U.S. opposition to the DPP referendum on UN 
<br>membership in the name of Taiwan have eased China's anxieties to a 
<br>degree. Nevertheless, our uneasy modus vivendi on the Taiwan issue 
<br>is fragile. Beijing may mistakenly come to believe, despite our 
<br>constant disclaimers, that we are willing to "manage" Taiwan in 
<br>partnership with China over the heads of Taiwan's democratically 
<br>elected leaders. Taiwan's next President may win a few short-term, 
<br>small concessions from China. However, thwarted Chinese expectations 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00000661 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>of progress toward reunification or of a U.S. willingness to "manage" 
<br>Taiwan could lead to a rocky medium term. 
<br>
<br>CHINA'S EXPANDING "CORE INTERESTS" 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) In addition to Taiwan and other sovereignty concerns (e.g., 
<br>Tibet and the Dalai Lama and Xinjiang and Rebiya Kadeer), China has 
<br>begun to articulate additional "core interests" in Chinese foreign 
<br>policy. So far, these core interests center on China's access to 
<br>energy resources. Thus, in Iran and Sudan China has resisted 
<br>international sanctions that would affect its energy cooperation. 
<br>Recently, China has suggested that cooperation in the UNSC and in 
<br>other areas is contingent on the U.S. not sanctioning Sinopec's 
<br>investment in Iran's Yadavaran oilfield. U.S. policy will need to 
<br>ensure that when we challenge China's self-defined core interests, we 
<br>do so deliberately and advisedly. 
<br>
<br>ROLE OF U.S. POLICY 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Many aspects of the U.S.-China relationship are not amenable 
<br>to foreign policy intervention. China's growth and slow settling 
<br>into the role of a great power result from largely economic and 
<br>historical trends. Similarly, tensions over Taiwan, given the firm 
<br>parameters of U.S. law and our interests in ensuring a peaceful 
<br>resolution of issues affecting a democratic Taiwan, will be 
<br>uavoidable. Nonetheless, we can protect our economic and political 
<br>interests, spur positive change in China and increase Beijing's 
<br>realization of its stake in effective international institutions and 
<br>international norms. China's changing worldview and increasing 
<br>interest in how it is perceived on the international stage will 
<br>create new opportunities to influence China. Pursuing an 
<br>increasingly close and cooperative U.S.-China relationship will 
<br>require constant attention and frequent high-level meetings and 
<br>dialogues to expand our common interests, manage our differences and 
<br>prevent misunderstandings and misperceptions in a rapidly changing 
<br>world.
