<br>SUBJECT: POSSIBLE RELEASE OF A.Q. KHAN
<br>
<br>Classified By: SCA Richard A. Boucher, Reasons: 1.4 B C AND D
<br>
<br>--------------------------
<br>SUMMARY AND Action request
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Washington is concerned that the government of
<br>Pakistan may release A.Q. Khan. Washington requests Post to
<br>please draw from points in para 4, as appropriate, with
<br>senior government officials including the Director General of
<br>Strategic Plans Division Lt. Gen (retd) Kidwai.
<br>
<br>End summary and action request.
<br>
<br>----------
<br>OBJECTIVES
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Post should achieve the following objectives:
<br>
<br>-- Inquire about the accuracy of press reports indicating
<br>that Dr. Khan will soon be released from house arrest.
<br>
<br>-- Express Washington,s strong opposition to the release of
<br>Dr. Khan and urge the Government of Pakistan to continue
<br>holding him under  house arrest.,
<br>
<br>-- Explain the possible negative consequences that the
<br>release of Dr. Khan will have on Pakistan,s image in the
<br>international community.  Note that it would undermine the
<br>positive steps Pakistan has taken on nonproliferation.
<br>
<br>-- Urge Pakistan to consider the long-term gains it could
<br>garner from the international community by continuing Dr.
<br>Khan,s current status rather than the short-term domestic
<br>political gains that could result from his release.
<br>
<br>End objectives.
<br>
<br>----------
<br>BACKGROUND
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Recent press reports indicate a plan for Dr.
<br>Khan,s release was approved for delivery to Prime Minister
<br>Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani. We should determine the accuracy of
<br>the reports and clearly indicate to the new government, as
<br>well as Director General Kidwai, our strong opposition to
<br>Khan,s release. Dr. Khan was the central figure in the most
<br>egregious violation of nonproliferation norms to date and his
<br>release would likely indicate to the international community
<br>a disregard by Pakistan for the dire threat still posed to
<br>international security by Dr. Khan,s activities. It could
<br>also undermine ongoing prosecution efforts underway in other
<br>countries to punish Khan associates and would be a setback to
<br>our ongoing bilateral nonproliferation efforts with Pakistan.
<br>
<br>End background.
<br>
<br>--------------
<br>Talking Points
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/Rel Pakistan) Begin Talking Points for Pakistan:
<br>
<br>-- Pakistan has taken positive steps over the past few years
<br>to demonstrate its commitment to nonproliferation, including
<br>enacting its 2004 export control law, establishing the
<br>Strategic Export Control Division (SECDIV), and joining the
<br>Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.
<br>
<br>-- We are deeply troubled by press reports that Pakistan may
<br>consider releasing Dr. Khan.  We hope that these press
<br>reports are not accurate.
<br>
<br>-- We urge you not to change Dr. Khan,s current status.
<br>While the release of Dr. Khan would be viewed positively by
<br>some in Pakistan, it would undermine Pakistan,s broader
<br>nonproliferation efforts and signal to the international
<br>community that Pakistan is no longer concerned about the harm
<br>caused by Dr. Khan and his network.
<br>
<br>-- When Dr. Khan was pardoned by President Musharraf,
<br>Pakistan was widely criticized in the international community
<br>for not having prosecuted him or anyone else associated with
<br>his proliferation activities.
<br>
<br>-- The damage done to international security by Dr. Khan and
<br>his associates is not a closed book.  Other countries
<br>continue efforts to prosecute those involved.  The U.S., and
<br>other countries, as well as the IAEA, are expending enormous
<br>amounts of time and resources to address the threats that
<br>resulted from Dr. Khan,s engagement with Iran, North Korea,
<br>and possibly other states.
<br>
<br>-- Because of Khan,s actions, the international community
<br>must contend with the reality that the uranium enrichment
<br>technology and nuclear weapons designs that were sold to
<br>Libya are now available to other states and non-state actors.
<br>This will make it much harder to combat nuclear
<br>proliferation in the future.
<br>
<br>-- The U.S. and Pakistan have worked together to address the
<br>problems caused by Dr. Khan,s proliferation to other
<br>countries and we look forward to our continued close
<br>cooperation on this and other related issues.
<br>
<br>End talking points for Pakistan.
