<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Leon said that Spain is politically divided at the 
<br>moment, as demonstrated by the PP's decision to adopt an 
<br>aggressive posture towards the GOS in hopes of bringing down 
<br>the government and forcing early elections.  He claimed that 
<br>PP leaders, including former President Aznar and former FM 
<br>Ana Palacio, were trying to use their contacts in Washington 
<br>to shape USG opinion against Zapatero.  The PP's objective, 
<br>he said, is to use bilateral friction between the USG and the 
<br>GOS as part of its campaign to unseat FM Moratinos, and 
<br>eventually Zapatero.  Leon said it was important for USG 
<br>officials, such as A/S Noriega, to understand that even 
<br>comments in seemingly innocuous settings can get picked up by 
<br>the press and have an impact far beyond that intended by the 
<br>speaker. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Charge noted that we had been sending an identical 
<br>message to GOS officials, with mixed success.  For example, 
<br>the visit of King Juan Carlos sent an excellent, positive 
<br>message regarding the importance of our bilateral relations, 
<br>but the positive effect had been negated by the simultaneous 
<br>visit of Venezuelan President Chavez to Madrid.  All of the 
<br>good news from the King's visit was drowned out by three days 
<br>of Chavez' revolutionary rhetoric and tirades against the USG 
<br>while standing next to Spanish officials. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Leon agreed that the Chavez visit had been a public 
<br>relations failure, adding that the GOS only invited Chavez 
<br>after months of requests from Chavez.  Turning to the King's 
<br>meeting with President Bush, Leon said that there might be 
<br>some "misunderstandings" on the part of the USG regarding the 
<br>GOS.  He said that when King Juan Carlos had raised Spain's 
<br>exclusion from November White House briefings on the Middle 
<br>East to which other European (G-8) countries had been 
<br>invited, President Bush, the King said, expressed surprise 
<br>and reassured the King that Spain would be invited to future 
<br>such meetings.
