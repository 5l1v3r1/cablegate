<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John Beyrle, Reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Your visit to Moscow provides an opportunity to 
<br>strengthen bilateral economic relations at a time when both 
<br>our economies are beginning to show signs of recovery 
<br>following an extremely difficult year. Because our economic 
<br>relations with Russia were relatively stable even prior to 
<br>the political "reset" we've seen this year, we are 
<br>well-positioned to press for progress on a few key issues, 
<br>including Russia's WTO accession, agricultural trade and 
<br>intellectual property rights, where more work is needed. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>U.S.-Russian Relations 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Four meetings this year between Presidents Obama and 
<br>Medvedev, including the President's July visit to Moscow, and 
<br>Secretary Clinton's numerous discussions with Foreign 
<br>Minister Lavrov have given impetus to real change in our 
<br>bilateral relations. Addressing the ruling United Russia 
<br>party congress November 21, President Medvedev even used the 
<br>phrase "reset" - heretofore reserved for issues involving the 
<br>U.S. and Russia - and called for an "economic reset" as well. 
<br>We want to see this will applied not just to the 
<br>modernization that Medvedev is advocating for Russia itself, 
<br>but to its interaction with foreign investors and integration 
<br>into global financial institutions, all of which force 
<br>reforms deeper into the system. The challenge, as always, is 
<br>to translate rhetoric into specific decisions and joint 
<br>actions. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) For the first time in years, we have structure in the 
<br>relationship to do this. The Obama-Medvedev Commission has 
<br>four working groups--business development and economic 
<br>relations, energy, nuclear energy, and agriculture--with a 
<br>remit to broaden the economic base of interaction between us. 
<br>The Commission will give us regular, focused interaction 
<br>with influential centers of Russia's business and economic 
<br>decision-making. In early contacts, some Russian 
<br>participants in the working groups have shown a preference 
<br>fro form over substance, though. We need to continue to set a 
<br>higher standard. The Commission needs to produce results, 
<br>not reports, and decisions, not dialogue. 
<br>
<br>Global Economic Crisis And Russia's Response 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The global economic crisis hit Russia particularly 
<br>hard, as the economy remains heavily dependent on commodities 
<br>exports (primarily oil and gas) for growth, and on foreign 
<br>capital for investment. The abrupt drop in the price of oil 
<br>combined with a decline in foreign investment strained the 
<br>Russian economy, beginning in mid-2008. Throughout the 
<br>following twelve-month period, Russian industrial production 
<br>plummeted, with double-digit declines in month-on-month 
<br>production occurring on a regular basis. Key sectors such as 
<br>steel and automobiles were hit particularly hard, with 
<br>Russian domestic automobile production declining by over 50% 
<br>in the first half of 2009. The industrial sector, 
<br>particularly the single-company towns, was hard hit, with 
<br>unemployment remaining at an unprecedented high. Predictions 
<br>for 2009 GDP decline grew from 3% early in the year, to the 
<br>current estimates of 7.5%. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) At the beginning of the crisis, the Russian government 
<br>held the third largest quantity of reserves internationally 
<br>and relatively little sovereign debt. Thus, the GOR was much 
<br>better positioned to react than many other countries. The 
<br>GOR burned through a third of these reserves (an estimated 
<br>$200 billion) to slow the decline of the ruble. The GOR also 
<br>provided large infusions of capital into the domestic 
<br>financial sector in an effort to keep stressed banks afloat. 
<br>In addition, the Russian government instituted a series of 
<br>"temporary crisis measures," including tariff increases and 
<br>other import restrictions, in an effort to protect domestic 
<br>production in key sectors and increase demand. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) While these measures were successful in staving off a 
<br>complete collapse of the financial sector a la 1998, they 
<br>have come at a price. Official Russian reserves are 
<br>significantly lower than at the start of the crisis and we 
<br>expect the GOR will be required to borrow, including on 
<br>international markets, in order to cover its expected federal 
<br>budget deficit in 2010. Also, while the infusions of cash 
<br>into the financial system prevented a total meltdown, banks 
<br>used much of the funding to make provisions for 
<br>non-performing loans and other distressed assets. The 
<br>infusions of cash did not result in a resumption of lending, 
<br>and domestic financing remains hard to come by, constraining 
<br>efforts to stimulate the real economy. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The tariff and other trade barriers did slow imports 
<br>during the first half of 2009, but the reduced competition 
<br>did not appear to do much to help domestic producers. 
<br>Domestic demand, particularly in the automotive and real 
<br>estate sectors, remains extremely weak. The GOR has pushed 
<br>companies to retain workers during the economic downturn, in 
<br>an effort to slow unemployment growth and avoid potential 
<br>social difficulties. As a result, many companies have used 
<br>their limited reserves to continue paying workers and are not 
<br>well placed to take advantage of an economic up-turn when it 
<br>arrives. That said, Russia appears to have muddled through 
<br>the worst of the crisis and, aided by higher oil prices and a 
<br>strengthening ruble, GOR officials are now considering how to 
<br>encourage a return to strong economic growth. 
<br>
<br>Key Challenges To Russian Economic Growth 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Dmitriy Medvedev has made a central theme of his 
<br>presidency Russia's need to diversify its economy, develop an 
<br>innovation economy based on its strong intellectual 
<br>resources, integrate itself into the global economy and deal 
<br>with the problems created by corruption. While we support 
<br>these objectives, we are concerned that progress has been 
<br>limited, at best. The recent economic crisis dealt yet 
<br>another blow to Russia's limited industrial base. The lack 
<br>of domestic financing limits entrepreneurs' efforts to move 
<br>into new sectors. Weak enforcement of intellectual property 
<br>laws and gaps in key areas, such as protections on encryption 
<br>technologies, restrict growth in IT and other innovative 
<br>sectors. Russia's on-again, off-again approach to WTO 
<br>accession has not only slowed down Russia's own accession 
<br>process, but has also made it difficult for others, such as 
<br>the U.S. and EU, who are interested in supporting Russia's 
<br>accession. Russia's continued tariff and non-tariff 
<br>restrictions on agricultural trade also present challenges to 
<br>increasing bilateral U.S.-Russia trade, as many U.S. 
<br>producers are simply not able to export their products to 
<br>Russia. Finally, corruption and "legal nihilism" continue to 
<br>plague the Russian governance system; the death in custody of 
<br>Russian lawyer Sergey Magnitskiy is only the latest example. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Domestic Political Context 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) After a year and a half of tandem leadership of 
<br>Russia, Medvedev and Putin continue to function based on a 
<br>division of labor. The President plays to his strengths of 
<br>clear public presentation and a long-range focus on a modern 
<br>economy, and underscores his constitutional responsibilities 
<br>for foreign policy. His November 12 annual address to the 
<br>nation again highlighted and expanded on the theme of 
<br>economic modernization, and to a lesser extent political 
<br>reform as well. Putin, meanwhile, has built on his image of 
<br>a domestic problem solver, employing his trademark 
<br>street-wise rhetoric in dressing down oligarchs or critics. 
<br>His November 21 address to the annual congress of the United 
<br>Russia party (which he heads) reaffirmed public perceptions 
<br>of him as the man who is making sure government pays pensions 
<br>and salaries. A just-published poll supports this: though 
<br>their ratings had been declining, they shot up to 74 and 79 
<br>percent, respectively, after their strong performances. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Although there is evidence that their closest 
<br>advisors spar over specific policies and personnel matters, 
<br>the two leaders themselves share state-run national media 
<br>coverage (to the near-exclusion of other political figures) 
<br>and project an aura of ease with one another in public. 
<br>Medvedev has yet to make major changes to the senior staff he 
<br>inherited from Putin. Putin's prominence in tackling crises 
<br>- whether conflict with Georgia, gas supply negotiations with 
<br>Ukraine, or localized unrest or frustration due to the 
<br>economic crisis - earns him higher public opinion ratings and 
<br>elite group allegiance than Medvedev. This, combined with 
<br>his suggestions that he might stand for a third presidential 
<br>term, all ensure that major decisions are not made without 
<br>Putin's approval. The complete national dominance of the 
<br>ruling United Russia party under the leadership of Putin, 
<br>reinforced through the party's overwhelming, yet tainted 
<br>victory in October 11 regional elections, has made it 
<br>difficult for opposition parties to function, let alone 
<br>capitalize on economic discontent. 
<br>
<br>Conclusion 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) In sum, your visit comes at a promising moment--both 
<br>our bilateral relations and our economies are beginning to 
<br>move in a more positive direction, but challenges remain. We 
<br>encourage you to use your meetings with key Russian 
<br>governmental and private interlocutors, as well as with the 
<br>American business community, to push for continued dialogue 
<br>leading to concrete positive action. We want Russia to 
<br>integrate into the global economy, to join the WTO, to 
<br>diversify its productive base and to move forward in the 
<br>fight against corruption and we stand ready to work with 
<br>Russia on these issues. Your meetings with Medvedev's top 
<br>economic adviser Dvorkovich and First Deputy Foreign Minister 
<br>Denisov, in particular, are a chance to move beyond improved 
<br>atmospherics and examine in greater depth how we can support 
<br>the best of Medvedev's modernization goals--e.g., greater 
<br>energy efficiency--in ways that pay dividends to both 
<br>economies and broaden the economic base of the relationship.
