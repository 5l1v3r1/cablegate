<br>SUBJECT: OMAN REMAINS WARY OF IRANIAN EXPANSIONISM 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Gary A. Grappo per 1.4 (B and D). 
<br> 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>¶1.  (S/NF)  Minister of the Royal Office and head of the 
<br>Office of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, 
<br>Lieutenant General Ali bin Majid al-Ma'amari, reviewed Oman's 
<br>view on Iran from a security perspective, highlighting Omani 
<br>awareness of Iran's deceptive tactics and expansionist 
<br>ideological desires in the region.  During an introductory 
<br>meeting with NAVCENT commander VADM William Gortney, 
<br>accompanied by the Ambassador, General Ali addressed the 
<br>Iranian nuclear file, security in the Strait of Hormuz, and 
<br>Iranian interference in the region.  Ali Majid's suspicious 
<br>view of Iran stands in stark contrast to conciliatory if not 
<br>obsequious public comments of Omani Minister Responsible for 
<br>Foreign Affairs Yusuf bin 'Alawi regarding Iran and its role 
<br>in the region.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>Won't Oppose Further Sanctions on Iran 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>¶2.  (S/NF)  Characterizing Oman's preference for "frankness 
<br>and clarity," General Ali began his comments on Iran by 
<br>noting the reality of Iran as a nearby neighbor, which 
<br>influenced Oman's relations with Iran.  Toward the end of the 
<br>discussion, he compared Oman's normal relations with Iran to 
<br>the relations of other GCC members with Iran.  Throughout the 
<br>meeting, he frequently touched on the theme of how different 
<br>Oman was from other GCC member states, whose real intentions 
<br>and positions often eluded Omani comprehension. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S/NF)  The Iranian nuclear issue stood at the forefront 
<br>of the General's mind.  He described the nuclear file as an 
<br>international issue, noting that resolution of this issue 
<br>should be dealt with through international bodies such as the 
<br>UN Security Council and the International Atomic Energy 
<br>Agency (IAEA).  Oman would respect decisions of these groups 
<br>and play its role in the international community.  Oman would 
<br>not oppose imposition of further measures against Iran by the 
<br>international bodies; however, Oman did not want to play an 
<br>active role in advocating for such measures itself. 
<br> 
<br>Iranian Intentions Clear:  Stall for Time 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>¶4.  (S/NF)  Ali Majid stated that Oman was aware of Iranian 
<br>stall tactics in the talks over the nuclear issue.  Instead 
<br>of responding by the August 5 deadline, the Iranian side 
<br>offered a new initiative for talks, confirming reports from 
<br>the U.S. and others that Iran indeed is trying merely to buy 
<br>time.  Letting the 5 August deadline pass in responding 
<br>positively to the P5 1 proposal made the Iranian intention to 
<br>stall "very clear to Oman."  The Ambassador noted that the 
<br>U.S. has been working with allies around the world, and 
<br>especially within the EU, to further restrict Iranian 
<br>economic activity in an effort to influence Iran's position 
<br>on the nuclear file.  General Ali agreed that sanctions to 
<br>date were having an impact on the Iranian economy, despite 
<br>Iran's public denials.  Moreover, he said, Iran believed the 
<br>U.S. would never attack Iran, a belief that encouraged Iran 
<br>to persist in its stall tactics.  Nevertheless, he advocated 
<br>a non-military solution as the best option for the U.S., and 
<br>suggested that over the long term, establishment of U.S. 
<br>relations at some level with the Iranian government might 
<br>enable the U.S. to better influence the Iranian government 
<br>and people. 
<br> 
<br>Empty Threats Against the Strait 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>¶5.  (S/NF)  Responding to the Ambassador's question about 
<br>recent Iranian statements threatening the Strait of Hormuz, 
<br>Ali Majid dismissed the threats as "empty words" and perhaps 
<br>a feeble attempt to up its bargaining leverage vis a vis the 
<br>P5 1.  VADM Gortney echoed the Ambassador's comments that 
<br>such rhetoric negatively impacted the world's view of Iran 
<br>and ultimately would undermine Iran's standing in the 
<br>international community.  On this same issue, the General 
<br>expressed his pleasure with the White House press statement 
<br>on August 5 responding to the IRGC commander's comments 
<br>regarding closure of the Strait, agreeing that Iranian 
<br>closure of the strait would be suicide (i.e., more harmful to 
<br>Iran's own economic interests).  He also commended the U.S. 
<br>for not escalating the rhetoric but instead putting Iran's 
<br>comments into proper perspective. 
<br> 
<br>Iraq and Iranian Expansionism 
<br> 
<br>MUSCAT 00000565  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>¶6.  (S/NF)  Prior to delving into the nuclear issues, Ali 
<br>Majid acknowledged that Iranian interference in Iraq 
<br>prevented achievement of a stable security environment there. 
<br> He allowed that, at a minimum, Iran indirectly supported 
<br>Shi'a militia in Iraq.  Elaborating on his theme of "Iranian 
<br>expansionist" ideology, he noted that the Iranian national 
<br>radio broadcast commenced with the prelude "the voice of the 
<br>Islamic Republic from Tehran."  Focusing on "from Tehran," he 
<br>astutely raised Omani concerns that such language revealed 
<br>Iran's true intentions:  a "greater Islamic Republic" with 
<br>Tehran at its center.  He further speculated that Iran wanted 
<br>to give the impression that the Islamic Republic might 
<br>already encompass "Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and even the Gulf." 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S/NF)  Ali Majid linked the nuclear issue and the 
<br>interference in Iraq by speculating that a resolution might 
<br>entice Iran into ceasing its interference in Iraq.  He 
<br>offered a rhetorical question on whether Iran was serious 
<br>about challenging the major powers or is it posturing in the 
<br>media for domestic consumption.  He conceded that he truly 
<br>did not know the answer, but that with Iran's continued 
<br>attitude on the nuclear issue, the security situation in Iraq 
<br>would remain unresolved.  Citing Oman's preference for a 
<br>non-military solution, he nevertheless acknowledged that a 
<br>nuclear-armed Iran as opposed to war with Iran posed "an 
<br>extremely difficult dilemma for all of us." 
<br> 
<br>Playing to Their Domestic Audience 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>¶8.  (S/NF)  Acknowledging Iran's revolutionary zeal, the 
<br>General attempted to put Iranian public statements in 
<br>perspective when he described as exaggerations those comments 
<br>by Iranian President Mahmud Ahmed-I Nejad or other Iranian 
<br>figures, particularly regarding military capabilities. 
<br>"Countries that believe they have some specific military 
<br>weapons advantages usually keep them secret," he averred.  He 
<br>asserted that in the end, all power resided with Supreme 
<br>Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S/NF)  Ali Majid portrayed Shi'a ideology as another 
<br>factor complicating possible military conflict with Iran. 
<br>Iranian leaders would not balk at sacrificing a quarter of 
<br>their 60 million citizens in a military conflict.  The Shi'a 
<br>tradition of martyrdom spanned 14 centuries.  The annual 
<br>self-flagellation of Shi'a over 1,400 years served as an 
<br>example of this martyr psychology.  Beyond its Shi'a 
<br>ideology, pride in its Persian national identity compelled 
<br>Iran to demand international recognition and respect. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (S/NF)  Returning back to comments about GCC countries, 
<br>General Ali singled out Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar as three 
<br>Gulf countries that probably would want the U.S. to strike 
<br>Iran.  However, he urged the U.S. to determine whether such 
<br>voices were speaking on the basis of logic or emotion.  He 
<br>likened private entreaties of these countries to the U.S. for 
<br>military action on Iran to the Iraqi opposition in exile 
<br>providing the U.S. false information on Iraq that led to the 
<br>invasion of Iraq.  At the beginning of the meeting, Ali Majid 
<br>had noted that, in contrast to Oman, other GCC members did 
<br>not always speak with candor or clarity, leaving Oman to 
<br>question the real motivations or intentions of its GCC 
<br>brethren. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (S/NF)  Punctuating his comments about Iran's 
<br>irrationality, Ali Majid pointed to Libyan leader Colonel 
<br>Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi's recent comment that "Iran is crazy" not 
<br>to pay attention to the history of Yugoslavia and Iraq, whose 
<br>ignoring of U.S. pressure resulted in their collapse. 
<br>Interestingly, he referred to Qadhafi's transformation from 
<br>pariah to emerging member of the international community by 
<br>noting that Qadhafi had once been "our enemy." 
<br> 
<br>Oman in a "Strategic Relationship" with the U.S. 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br>¶12.  (S)  Shifting from Iran, Ali Majid underscored Oman's 
<br>"strategic relationship" with the U.S. and highlighted Oman's 
<br>cooperation with the U.S. on counterterrorism issues.  He 
<br>described Oman's zero tolerance for extremism and refusal to 
<br>negotiate with terrorists as a policy established at least 
<br>since 1970 (the year of the Sultan's assumed power).  Oman 
<br>has been and continues to prepare itself to confront 
<br>terrorism, he said, as it is not exempt from the plotting of 
<br>terrorists.  While Oman is "encircled by problems" -- 
<br>specifically mentioning Yemen, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan -- 
<br> 
<br>MUSCAT 00000565  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Oman remains vigilant in preventing such problems from 
<br>reaching the Sultanate.  On the topic of Oman's partnership 
<br>with the U.S., he harkened back to when the Soviets had 
<br>sought a warm water port during the time of their invasion of 
<br>Afghanistan and were rebuffed by Muscat as an example of how 
<br>"Oman has stood at the side of the U.S."  He also highlighted 
<br>the irony that now the world faced "not the Soviets but the 
<br>Taliban."  He quickly followed this by noting that the U.S. 
<br>would be wise to support talks with moderate members of the 
<br>Taliban, which Oman encouraged as a way toward achieving 
<br>security in Afghanistan. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (S/NF)  Participants in the meeting included VADM 
<br>Gortney, the Ambassador, the admiral's executive officer, 
<br>Embassy Muscat's OMC Chief, and GRPO (notetaker).  Sayyid 
<br>Munthir bin Majid al-Sa'id, head of the Royal Office Liaison 
<br>and Coordination Service participated as notetaker and 
<br>translator for General Ali. 
<br> 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>¶14.  (S/NF)  In light of recent, more conciliatory statements 
<br>by Minister Responsible for foreign Affairs Yusuf bin 'Alawi, 
<br>Ali Majid's blunt assessment of Iranian intentions comes as 
<br>refreshing reassurance of the official Omani position on 
<br>Iran.  While careful to flag Oman's longstanding preference 
<br>for a non-military solution to the Iran question and, less 
<br>directly, Oman's inability to actively confront Iranian 
<br>obstinacy, the Sultanate nevertheless maintains a clear-eyed 
<br>view of Iran, its increasingly threatening behavior and the 
<br>potential repercussions for the region.  His comments 
<br>regarding attitudes and perceptions of fellow GCC members 
<br>were startling as they would appear to confirm oft stated 
<br>views of GCC counterparts of Oman as the sometimes "odd man 
<br>out" in the GCC.  Ali Majid's comments suggest that while not 
<br>entirely comfortable with this, the Omanis acknowledge it. 
<br>Ali Majid, as the Sultan's top security official and advisor, 
<br>is known for taking a more hard-line view of matters relating 
<br>to regional security.  However, given his closeness to the 
<br>Sultan and his status as a member of the inner-most circle of 
<br>the Sultan's confidants, such views to a senior U.S. officer 
<br>can be assumed to accord with those of Qaboos.
