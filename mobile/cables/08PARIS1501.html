<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Kathleen Allegrone, 1.4 (b/ 
<br>d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The revised Africa policy President 
<br>Nicolas Sarkozy announced after taking office in May 2007 is 
<br>taking shape. This new policy features a reduction and 
<br>consolidation of France's military presence to align it more 
<br>closely with Africa's regional structures, more 
<br>"business-like" relations replacing the "France-Afrique" 
<br>model, larger EU and UN roles, and increased expectations in 
<br>terms of transparency, good governance, and results on the 
<br>part of Africans receiving French aid. While the advantages 
<br>of France-Afrique allowed that model to endure for decades, 
<br>its saliency has weakened as the colonial era grows more 
<br>distant and as the political and economic costs to France of 
<br>backstopping former colonies have become harder to sustain. 
<br>In modernizing and normalizing relations with Africa, the 
<br>French risk losing some influence while reducing a number of 
<br>burdens. This is a trade-off they believe they must make, 
<br>and seem confident that the France engaged with Africans on 
<br>these new terms will be an attractive partner capable of 
<br>sustaining old relationships and cultivating and nurturing 
<br>new ones across the continent. The new policy may also 
<br>provide opportunities for the U.S. to extend its influence in 
<br>Africa without meeting French resistance or interference. 
<br>Part I (this message) provides historical background and 
<br>outlines Sarkozy's policy shift; Part II (septel) focuses on 
<br>its implementation and African reaction; Part III (septel) 
<br>centers on the new policy's military/security aspects. END 
<br>SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>"France-Afrique" 
<br>---------------- 
<br>¶2. (C) Former Cote d,Ivoire President Houphouet-Boigny 
<br>reputedly coined the phrase "France-Afrique" (in French, the 
<br>more evocative "francafrique" with a cedilla under the "c") 
<br>to describe the complex web of economic, military, political, 
<br>social, and cultural ties that linked France with its former 
<br>colonies and to a lesser extent non-francophone Africa. 
<br>These ties, built over decades of colonial rule, persisted 
<br>after independence in the 1960s, and provided a mutually 
<br>beneficial environment for both sides, with Africans enjoying 
<br>French protection, military and security support, and, not 
<br>least, foreign aid. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The governmental, educational, legal, military, 
<br>bureaucratic, and administrative systems and methods of many 
<br>former African colonies were modeled on French structures, 
<br>and many still are. French is often the official language 
<br>and lingua franca (sometimes in competition with a dominant 
<br>local language) in several African countries. Often, air 
<br>travel between nearby African countries could only be done by 
<br>transiting Paris. These factors alone guaranteed continuing 
<br>French influence post-independence in many African societies. 
<br>Other "benefits" were manifest: African leaders were able 
<br>to amass private fortunes sometimes transformed into vast 
<br>real estate and other holdings in France and elsewhere in 
<br>Europe, cases of which the press continues to uncover to this 
<br>day. France profited from a ready-made set of compliant 
<br>client states and leaders, easy access to resources and 
<br>markets for exports, and a tacitly accorded freedom of 
<br>action, both private and official, for French and locals 
<br>alike, of the sort that produced cases like the "Falcone 
<br>Affair," the long-running arms trafficking case in Angola. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Culturally, Africans of the colonial and 
<br>independence eras were deeply steeped in French ways, with 
<br>some achieving high positions in France, e.g., 
<br>Houphouet-Boigny's serving in the French government and 
<br>Senegal President Senghor's rise to the very pinnacle of 
<br>French society with his election to the Academie Francaise. 
<br>The African elite and their children were often schooled in 
<br>France, with the ever-expanding "francophonie" movement 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001501 002.2 OF 006 
<br>
<br>
<br>ensuring that they remained part of France's global network. 
<br>At the other end of the scale, tens of thousands of African 
<br>colonial troops fought for France during the World Wars and 
<br>other conflicts, with surviving veterans still receiving 
<br>pensions for their service to France. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) France-Afrique operated well for decades, under the 
<br>tutelage of a succession of "Mr. Africas" at the French 
<br>Presidency, beginning with the legendary and controversial 
<br>Jacques Foccart, Africa Advisor to de Gaulle, Pompidou, and, 
<br>briefly, Mitterrand and Chirac. Others in that role have 
<br>included Mitterrand's son Jean-Christophe. For many years, 
<br>the Africa Advisor at the Presidency did not report to the 
<br>President's Diplomatic Advisor (the French equivalent of our 
<br>National Security Advisor) but directly to the President, 
<br>thus enjoying a status equal to or perhaps even greater than 
<br>that of the Diplomatic Advisor (who had to worry about the 
<br>rest of the world), a fact not lost on those currying favor 
<br>at the Presidency. 
<br>
<br>Nothing Lasts Forever 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>¶6. (C) As the 20th century drew to a close, France-Afrique 
<br>as an effective model began having trouble adjusting to a 
<br>changing global landscape. We noted certain factors in Ref A 
<br>(05 Paris 5459 -- The Future of France in Sub-Saharan 
<br>Africa). These include shrinking older generations on both 
<br>sides wedded to France-Afrique; younger generations lacking 
<br>such knowledge and experience and less reflexively inclined 
<br>to view relations through the France-Afrique optic; increased 
<br>exposure of Africans to other parts of the world, either 
<br>first hand or through the omnipresent global media; 
<br>aggressive pursuit of African resources and commerce by 
<br>hitherto outsiders (e.g., especially China -- see Ref B, 06 
<br>Paris 5733 -- China in Africa); and, culturally and socially, 
<br>a growing exposure to non-French films, fashions, sports, 
<br>music, and literature, with the U.S. enjoying an advantage in 
<br>this area. Francophone Africans began to lose their tendency 
<br>to look to France as their model. In short, France-Afrique 
<br>began falling victim to several of globalization's effects. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) For France, the cost of maintaining France-Afrique 
<br>started becoming less commensurate with its returns, both 
<br>political and economic. France shifted to an all-volunteer 
<br>military in 2001, which immediately increased the cost of 
<br>sustaining a global military presence. EU requirements limit 
<br>deficit spending, France's traditionally generous safety net 
<br>and an aging population strain finances, and booming and 
<br>resource-hungry economies elsewhere raise the cost of 
<br>commercial transactions, threatening French privilege in 
<br>Africa. Cost-cutting, at home and abroad, has become a 
<br>priority for the GOF, and maintaining the qualitative and 
<br>quantitative investment France-Afrique entailed is becoming 
<br>harder to accomplish. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Politically, brush fires have occurred that are 
<br>harder and more expensive to put out. The French are quite 
<br>bitter about Cote d,Ivoire, once a crown jewel of 
<br>France-Afrique, which spiraled into chaos after the death of 
<br>one of France-Afrique's biggest advocates and beneficiaries, 
<br>Houphouet-Boigny, reaching a nadir with the November 2004 
<br>bombing by Cote d,Ivoire of French forces in Bouake. 
<br>Operation Licorne in Cote d,Ivoire, perhaps France's last 
<br>unilateral military intervention in the old style, has cost 
<br>France about 250 million euro per year, or well over a 
<br>billion euro in total, without yielding decisive results. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Other brush fires and scandals, which in earlier 
<br>days might have been ignored or covered up, have erupted with 
<br>regularity: Borrel in Djibouti, Kieffer in Cote d,Ivoire, 
<br>and Falcone in Angola, to name a few. In addition to 
<br>Falcone, other renegade French in recent times have been 
<br>making mischief across the continent -- Bob Dennard 
<br>repeatedly in the Comoros, Gnassingbe advisor Charles 
<br>Debbasch and arms dealer Robert Montoya in Togo (with effects 
<br>in Cote d,Ivoire), and, recently, the Zoe's Ark "rescue" 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001501 003.2 OF 006 
<br>
<br>
<br>mission of Darfur children. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In the past, the GOF might have tacitly or openly 
<br>tolerated or even supported some of these activities. Now, 
<br>with an instant global media and the weakened cover afforded 
<br>by a deteriorating France-Afrique, these become problems, if 
<br>not major scandals, that must be addressed in a less 
<br>sheltered environment. One old-timer, commenting on 
<br>Sarkozy's trip to Chad in the Zoe's Ark case to seek the 
<br>partial release of French and other Europeans implicated in 
<br>the "adoption" scandal, sniffed that "it used to be that one 
<br>phone call from the Elysee would have settled this. How far 
<br>we have come that the President himself has to go there, and 
<br>even then, doesn't really finish the job." In pushing for 
<br>good governance, transparency, accountability, and a free 
<br>press as part of its democratization, foreign assistance, and 
<br>human rights agendas, France has partly become its own 
<br>victim, as those forces have helped bring scandals to light. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) France-Afrique provided privileges to France but 
<br>carried a burden of expectation that has become harder to 
<br>shoulder. Everyone acknowledged France's primacy in parts of 
<br>Africa, but this created expectations that when problems 
<br>arose, "the French will take care of it." France was long 
<br>able and willing to face these challenges when everyone 
<br>accepted this reality, but that is no longer the case. 
<br>France-Afrique has sometimes been a double-edged sword, with 
<br>some, including Africans, wanting France to intervene 
<br>forcefully when problems arise, but with others happy to 
<br>accuse France of acting unilaterally or as a 
<br>"neo-colonialist" when it does. "Damned if you do, damned if 
<br>you don't" has become an underlying theme in the debate over 
<br>France's role in Africa. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The Chirac government, while aware of 
<br>France-Afrique's stagnation, was disinclined to do much about 
<br>it and tried to preserve France-Afrique's facade. Acting in 
<br>the old style, Chirac, to some embarrassment, was quick to 
<br>mourn the 2005 death of his "friend" Eyadema in Togo and to 
<br>accept quickly the questionable process that led to his son's 
<br>taking power. The Presidency, citing "executive privilege," 
<br>refused to turn over records to judicial authorities 
<br>investigating the Borrel case, although Michel de Bonnecorse, 
<br>the Presidency's last "Mr. Africa," had to suffer the 
<br>indignity of having his personal home and vacation house 
<br>searched. As in the heyday of France-Afrique, the French 
<br>military was given a relatively free hand in responding 
<br>militarily to rebel incursions in Chad and C.A.R. prior to 
<br>the end of the Chirac era. 
<br>
<br>Sarkozy Brings Change 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>¶13. (C) As he did in other areas on taking office in May 
<br>2007, Sarkozy wrought change to the Africa account. His 
<br>basic approach has been to try to clean the slates, rid 
<br>relations of the colonial era hangover, and conduct more 
<br>"normal and business-like" relations with Africans. He is 
<br>quick to attribute events and activities before his 
<br>Presidency to "past French governments," always suggesting 
<br>that he represents a new era. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C/NF) Sarkozy did away with the "Mr. Africa" position 
<br>-- at least on paper. He named Jean-David Levitte (who had 
<br>the same job under Chirac before becoming UN PermRep and then 
<br>Ambassador to the U.S.) as his Diplomatic Advisor, and Bruno 
<br>Joubert as Levitte's Deputy. Joubert, however, is also the 
<br>President's senior advisor on Africa and was previously MFA 
<br>A/S for Africa. The "Mr. Africa" position no longer 
<br>officially exists, but Joubert, already wearing one hat as 
<br>Levitte's Deputy, functionally also wears the hat the former 
<br>Africa Advisors wore, although he now reports to Levitte 
<br>rather than directly to the President. Two "technical 
<br>counselors" work with him -- Remi Marechaux (francophone 
<br>Africa plus South Africa, a specialty), and Romain Serman 
<br>(non-francophone Africa, UN issues, and crises). When one of 
<br>Marechaux's countries goes into crisis, Serman will often 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001501 004.2 OF 006 
<br>
<br>
<br>take charge. Marechaux was an MFA AF DAS-equivalent when 
<br>Joubert was MFA AF A/S, and Serman previously covered Africa 
<br>at the UN. Marechaux earlier worked at the Department under 
<br>the Fellowship of Hope exchange program. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C/NF) Joubert, Marechaux, and Serman make an effective 
<br>team, with complementary styles -- Joubert a classic 
<br>diplomat, smooth, and savvy bureaucratically; Marechaux 
<br>intellectual, cerebral, and somewhat reserved; and Serman 
<br>fiery, action oriented, and a master of rapid repartee in 
<br>both French and English. They dominate African issues within 
<br>the GOF, and although they collaborate closely with MFA 
<br>colleagues, they seem to win intra-GOF disputes. Their MFA 
<br>counterparts -- AF A/S Jean de Gliniasty and DASs Helene Le 
<br>Gal, Christine Fages, and (temporarily) Christian Daziano -- 
<br>are also quite capable and friendly, but they do not have the 
<br>same drive or clout that comes with being in close proximity 
<br>to the hyperactive and demanding Sarkozy. Joubert (who knew 
<br>her when he was MFA AF A/S) and Gliniasty handpicked 
<br>Charlotte Montel, a virtual first-tour officer (and 2009 IVLP 
<br>member), to serve in FM Kouchner's cabinet, ensuring the 
<br>presence of a dependable colleague on African issues within 
<br>Kouchner's inner circle. Montel's role has increased with 
<br>the recent departure of Laurent Contini (new Ambassador to 
<br>Zimbabwe), who was Kouchner's senior AF Advisor but who will 
<br>not be replaced. 
<br>
<br>The New Policy 
<br>-------------- 
<br>¶16. (C) Sarkozy used three speeches to express publicly the 
<br>new direction Africa policy would take, in Dakar on July 26, 
<br>2007, in Lisbon at the EU-Africa Summit on December 8, 2007, 
<br>and in Cape Town on February 28, 2008. The general theme 
<br>emerging from these speeches is that France will seek to 
<br>modernize relations, get rid of lingering colonialist and 
<br>post-colonialist baggage, engage with Africans on a more 
<br>business-like and arms-length basis, no longer seek to play a 
<br>paternal role, and instead opt for a partnership among 
<br>equals. To be sure, Sarkozy promises continued French 
<br>engagement, but engagement based on a calculation of 
<br>interests rather than on inertia and outdated sentiments 
<br>deemed to be relics of the past. He calls on Africans to 
<br>meet this challenge and to begin relating to France and 
<br>others on the same basis. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) The speeches -- and the outlines of the new policy 
<br>-- were received with varying degrees of acceptance. The 
<br>Dakar speech included apologies for France's colonial past 
<br>but also suggested that Africans needed to acknowledge that 
<br>they derived benefits from the colonial period. Sarkozy 
<br>stated that Africans needed to become more self-reliant, less 
<br>dependent, and to take charge of their destinies without 
<br>raising "colonialism" and its ills as the continuing source 
<br>of their problems or as excuses. Some Africans welcomed 
<br>Sarkozy's speech as a necessary dose of reality while others 
<br>claimed that his call for a less paternalistic relationship 
<br>was delivered in a distinctly paternalistic and condescending 
<br>manner. (See Part II, septel, for a discussion of Africa 
<br>reactions to Sarkozy's policy.) 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C/NF) Presidential Advisor Serman later said that the 
<br>Dakar speech was drafted by Henri Guaino, Sarkozy's Special 
<br>Advisor, and had not been vetted by Levitte, Joubert's unit, 
<br>or the MFA. Serman believed the speech was too provocative 
<br>and not "diplomatic" enough and would have been revised had 
<br>Guaino not given it, uncleared, directly to Sarkozy. (Of 
<br>note, on July 26, 2008, one year after the Dakar speech, 
<br>Guaino published a self-serving article in Le Monde 
<br>justifying the approach he took in the speech.) The Lisbon 
<br>and Cape Town speeches received closer vetting and their tone 
<br>was less aggressive, although their contents built on the 
<br>foundation laid in Dakar. The Lisbon speech, delivered at 
<br>the EU-Africa Summit, stressed the importance of a strong 
<br>Europe working with a strong Africa. The centerpiece of the 
<br>Cape Town speech was Sarkozy's plan to change France's 
<br>military posture in Africa (analyzed in Part III, septel). 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001501 005.2 OF 006 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>"Reward the Good, Punish the Bad" 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>¶19. (C) Our GOF contacts say that Sarkozy's Africa policy 
<br>intends to "normalize" relations with Africa, strip them of 
<br>the France-Afrique veneer, make them more transparent, hold 
<br>Africans to certain standards of accountability and 
<br>responsibility, and end France-Afrique's long cycle of 
<br>dependency and paternalism. Serman puts it succinctly: 
<br>"Sarkozy wants to reward the good and punish the bad." The 
<br>GOF views some of the Defense Agreements (see Part III, 
<br>septel) maintained with eight African countries as patently 
<br>absurd and out of date -- for example, Serman says that 
<br>several agreements give France exclusive monopoly rights to 
<br>natural resources. "Nobody pays any attention to this, so we 
<br>need to get rid of it all and stop playing pretend." 
<br>
<br>U.S. an Attractive Partner in Africa 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>¶20. (C) Sarkozy's policy acknowledges the growing role in 
<br>Africa of former outsiders such as China and takes a 
<br>favorable view towards increased U.S. engagement. Although 
<br>skeptical at first and sensitive about protecting French 
<br>influence, the French have gradually come to accept, if not 
<br>welcome, U.S. activities such as AFRICOM, TSCTP, ACOTA, AGOA, 
<br>MCC, and other Africa-centric U.S. projects. The French do 
<br>not find them threatening and, moreover, they offer the 
<br>possibility of a new U.S. willingness to "share the burden" 
<br>in Africa that earlier fell largely on France. Moreover, the 
<br>French are comfortable with an expanding U.S. presence in 
<br>Africa as a counterbalance to China's regional expansion. 
<br>Sarkozy's policy, combined with his generally favorable views 
<br>of the U.S., may allow the U.S. a freer hand in Africa, at 
<br>least as far as the French are concerned. 
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) Similarly, the French are seeking to increase EU 
<br>and UN engagement in Africa as another form of burdensharing 
<br>and to allow France to operate discreetly behind EU and/or UN 
<br>cover. The French have actively sought EU and UN involvement 
<br>in recent years, from elections support in a number of places 
<br>to military support in DRC and Chad/C.A.R. Success in 
<br>lobbying EU members (and some non-members) to deploy EUFOR in 
<br>Chad and C.A.R., although deployment required the French to 
<br>provide more troops and equipment than first desired, was a 
<br>significant political milestone in French eyes and the EUFOR 
<br>case may represent the way the French will try to engage the 
<br>EU in future crises. The French went out of their way to 
<br>depict this as an EU and not French activity. The possible 
<br>transformation of EUFOR into a UN PKO would also be 
<br>consistent with French desires to increase the UN's role in 
<br>crisis management, a process that has also worked in Cote 
<br>d,Ivoire with the linkage between the French Operation 
<br>Licorne and UNOCI. 
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) As noted in Ref B and above, the French remain 
<br>concerned about China's growing influence in Africa and 
<br>believe that the Chinese employ methods to achieve their ends 
<br>that are no longer practiced (at least not so overtly or 
<br>boldly) by France and the West. They express frustration 
<br>that the Chinese can operate so effectively, acknowledge that 
<br>many African countries are easily seduced by Chinese 
<br>practices, but also are quick to notice any African backlash 
<br>suggesting that there is "too much China too fast" in Africa, 
<br>a backlash that seems to be gathering momentum. Publicly, 
<br>Sarkozy's attitude has been that France has no objection to 
<br>China's becoming more present in Africa -- so long as 
<br>Africans apply the same rules to the Chinese that are applied 
<br>to everyone else. 
<br>
<br>Policy as a Reflection of Personality 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>¶23. (C) The new Africa policy -- a break with the past, the 
<br>shelving of relations based on history and sentiment, the 
<br>call for rationalizing relations and having them reflect the 
<br>shared interests of equals, the insistence on transparency 
<br>and accountability, the desire to work constructively in 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001501 006.2 OF 006 
<br>
<br>
<br>Africa with partners such as the U.S., EU, and UN -- seems 
<br>very much a reflection of Sarkozy himself, who came to office 
<br>in a hurry to initiate reform left and right, and not simply 
<br>to tinker on the margins. There have been a few setbacks on 
<br>the domestic front, where he has had to compromise when faced 
<br>with entrenched groups willing to push back. In foreign 
<br>affairs, however, he has had a freer hand, and in some ways 
<br>France-Afrique was an institution waiting to be changed. 
<br>Previous French leaders talked about changing France's 
<br>relations with Africa and may have taken a few steps but 
<br>Sarkozy is doing significantly more than that, at least from 
<br>today's vantage point.. 
<br>
<br>¶24. (C) One close observer reminds that Sarkozy, himself a 
<br>sharp break with French tradition, is the first French 
<br>President to have grown up without meaningful personal 
<br>experience with the colonial era and is therefore free of 
<br>sentimental attachment to France-Afrique. To Sarkozy, 
<br>France-Afrique no longer makes sense, with France and Africa 
<br>needing to modernize their ties and move on, based on a 
<br>calculation of interests on both sides, which, in Sarkozy's 
<br>view for the French, boils down to "reward the good, punish 
<br>the bad." 
<br>
<br>¶25. (C) How have the French gone about implementing this 
<br>new policy and how have Africans reacted to it? See Part II 
<br>(septel) for a discussion of those topics.
