<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Venezuelan doctors have accused the Venezuelan
<br>Government (GBRV) of politicizing health care at the expense of the
<br>health of Venezuelans. In recent months, protests have paralyzed
<br>hospitals across Venezuela as doctors and patients have complained
<br>of shortages of medical supplies, delays in hospital renovations
<br>and unpaid wages and benefits. Observers describe public hospitals
<br>as increasingly dangerous places where underpaid, undersupplied,
<br>and understaffed doctors struggle to provide medical services to
<br>Venezuela's poor. Critics say that the GBRV has created a parallel
<br>medical system-"Barrio Adentro"-that has sucked resources away from
<br>the traditional hospital network and reduced the overall quality of
<br>medical services. The GBRV has suspended doctors for speaking out
<br>about the crisis while giving former military officers and
<br>community councils a greater role in hospital administration. On
<br>November 29, President Chavez announced plans to eliminate a
<br>government health care benefit that pays for public workers to
<br>receive health care at private clinics, a move that would place
<br>even greater strain on already overburdened public hospitals. END
<br>SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>HOSPTIAL CRISIS SPREADS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) In recent months, newspapers across Venezuela have
<br>carried daily reports of a growing crisis in the public hospitals.
<br>On November 30, for example, "Notitarde" published reports of a
<br>vigil by patients and doctors to protest shortages of medicines and
<br>supplies at the Enrique Tejera Hospital; on December 1, Ciudad
<br>Guayana's "Correo del Caroni" covered the "technical closure" of
<br>the Negra Hipolita Maternity Ward after the breakdown of the air
<br>conditioning system raised concerns that the heat would increase
<br>bacteria levels in the incubators for newborn babies; and on
<br>December 4, the daily "El Universal" reported that doctors in
<br>Merida had shut down the University Hospital of Los Andes (HULA)
<br>due to medical supply shortages, pronouncing the hospital "dead."
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>DOCTORS PROTEST DETERIORATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) On November 18, in a development representative of the
<br>breakdown of public hospitals across the country, the Jesus Yerena
<br>de Lidice Hospital shut down after 140 physicians announced their
<br>mass resignation. Lidice is one of the two largest and most
<br>important public hospitals in the impoverished Catia municipality
<br>of Caracas; it serves a poor and marginalized community that
<br>otherwise has little access to health care.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) For over three months, Lidice's patients and doctors have
<br>protested shortages of medical supplies, delays in the renovation
<br>of hospital wards, and unpaid wages and benefits. But the conflict
<br>escalated on November 16, when the Health Ministry suspended four
<br>of Lidice's doctors after charging them with inciting protests
<br>among the patients. Lidice's doctors resigned en masse after the
<br>Health Ministry refused to reinstate the four suspended doctors and
<br>resume negotiations over salary payments and benefits owed since
<br>¶2007. The resignations paralyzed Lidice, leaving only two
<br>doctors-an internal specialist and a surgeon-to care for the
<br>remaining patients.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Although Lidice reopened on November 20 after the Health
<br>and Labor Ministry agreed to reinstate the four suspended
<br>physicians and resume negotiations over other demands, the
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00001551 002 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>emergency pediatrics unit and maternity ward remain closed for
<br>renovation. The maternity ward of the Lidice hospital-considered
<br>the second most important in Caracas for many years-has now been
<br>closed for two years, while Catia's other major public hospital,
<br>Los Magallanes Jose Gregorio Hernandez, has been partially closed
<br>for over a year while awaiting renovation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>PUBLIC HOSPITALS ARE DANGEROUS, UNDERSUPPLIED, AND UNDERSTAFFED
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) During a private meeting on November 10,
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, a health reporter for the "El Universal"
<br>newspaper, described the public hospitals as increasingly dangerous
<br>places, where underpaid, undersupplied, and understaffed doctors
<br>work in unsanitary conditions to provide medical services to
<br>Venezuela's poor. Due to shortages of basic medical supplies,
<br>doctors ask patients to purchase their own needles, disinfectants
<br>and gauze. XXXXXXXXXXXX told EmbOffs that doctors sometimes dress wounds
<br>with the same dirty bandages. Other patients are told to bring
<br>their own X-rays from private clinics. As in many areas of
<br>Caracas, public hospitals suffer from water shortages, forcing
<br>doctors to postpone important operations. In some of the older
<br>public hospitals, the plumbing systems cannot pump water above the
<br>first few floors of the building.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX estimated that medical residents in public hospitals
<br>make an average of 2,000 bolivars (BsF) per month (USD 930 at the
<br>official rate of 2.15 BsF to the dollar). According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, over
<br>fifty percent of the resident doctors move to the capital from
<br>other parts of the country, and their salary is barely enough to
<br>cover rent in Caracas, where an austere apartment in a dangerous
<br>neighbourhood can easily cost 1,800 bolivars per month.
<br>Consequently, many doctors have left the public hospitals in search
<br>of other jobs, while some of the most qualified have left the
<br>country to earn better salaries abroad. In a December 4 press
<br>report, the Venezuelan Medical Federation (FMV) estimated that the
<br>public hospitals are understaffed by 43 percent.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Crime has further contributed to the flight of doctors from
<br>the public sector. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that criminals go to the public
<br>hospitals to rob, steal, and even kill patients. The emergency
<br>room in Hospital Vargas is only open for twelve hours-between seven
<br>in the morning and seven at night-because of security concerns. In
<br>October, a shootout in the emergency room of the Los Magallanes de
<br>Catia hospital killed two people. Although the Ministry of Health
<br>has promised to send more guards to protect the hospitals, in many
<br>cases the additional security has not arrived.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) On November 17, XXXXXXXXXXXX told EconOff that the GBRV has
<br>suspended doctors to discourage them from speaking out about the
<br>health care crisis. Last year four doctors were suspended when
<br>they exposed the accidental death of six babies in a maternity
<br>ward. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the GBRV has limited the role of the
<br>resident doctors in hospital management and transferred authority
<br>to local community councils. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that community council
<br>members meet with hospital directors to discuss renovation
<br>proposals. On November 10, the director for the Vargas Hospital of
<br>Caracas, Francisco Hernandez, told the press that he had to present
<br>the hospital's renovation proposals to the community councils
<br>before sending them to the Health Ministry and President Chavez for
<br>approval.
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00001551 003 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>BARRIO ADENTRO DRAINS RESOURCES FROM PUBLIC HOSPITALS
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX told EmbOffs that the quality of health care in the
<br>public hospitals has deteriorated as the GBRV has redirected
<br>resources to "Barrio Adentro," a program staffed by the Cuban
<br>Government that provides free medical services in poor areas (Ref
<br>A). Although "Barrio Adentro" has translated into political gains
<br>for President Chavez, its medical impact is questionable, despite
<br>having received massive government investment (Note: The GBRV spent
<br>approximately USD 5.6 billion on Cuban medical assistance,
<br>training, medicines, vaccines, and other services in 2008,
<br>according to one estimate. See Ref A for further analysis of
<br>Barrio Adentro. End Note.). While Chavez has acknowledged a
<br>"crisis" in "Barrio Adentro" and announced a sweeping campaign to
<br>revitalize the program, neither President Chavez nor his ministers
<br>have announced new plans for additional investment in the
<br>traditional public hospital system.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) On October 5, the President of the Venezuelan Medical
<br>Federation (FMV) XXXXXXXXXXXX told EmbOffs that
<br>the health care problem is primarily political.
<br>According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the GBRV has focused resources on the
<br>development of a parallel medical system-"Barrio Adentro" -that has
<br>sucked investment away from the hospitals and the traditional
<br>medical infrastructure to the detriment of the health of
<br>Venezuelans. At the same time, the GBRV has appointed military
<br>professionals with no medical background to important positions in
<br>the Ministry of Health. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that there is "anarchy" in the
<br>Ministry of Health, pointing out that the GBRV has released health
<br>statistics just four times in the last 14 months. FMV Vice
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX added that vaccination rates have
<br>decreased dramatically over the past several years.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) While the GBRV has prioritized "Barrio Adentro" over the
<br>traditional medical system, Venezuelans seem to prefer public
<br>hospitals or private clinics. On October 9, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>told EmbOffs that the majority of Venezuelans
<br>continue to receive medical care in public hospitals or private
<br>clinics rather than "Barrio Adentro." XXXXXXXXXXXX cited a 2006 study
<br>by a team of European Union analysts that measured the use of
<br>health services by sector (i.e., public hospitals, private clinics,
<br>or "Barrio Adentro") and confirmed that poorer Venezuelans were
<br>more likely to receive medical care in public hospitals than
<br>"Barrio Adentro."
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>CHAVEZ THREATENS TO ELIMINATE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFIT
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) On November 29, in a move that further illustrated GBRV
<br>efforts to strengthen "Barrio Adentro" as an alternative to the
<br>traditional medical system, Chavez announced his intention to
<br>eliminate the hospitalization, surgery, and maternity (HCM) benefit
<br>that public sector employees use to pay for health care at private
<br>clinics. During a broadcast of the "Hello, President" radio and
<br>television program, Chavez said that the HCM benefit supported the
<br>"bourgeoisie" owners of private clinics and that public employees
<br>should instead use "Barrio Adentro's" network of Integral
<br>Diagnostic Centers. In press reports the following day, public
<br>employees in the petroleum, iron, steel, and aluminum sectors
<br>protested the announcement (Note: According to one press report,
<br>sixty percent of the 12 million Venezuelans with health insurance
<br>work in the public sector. End Note.). Critics pointed out that
<br>the private clinics offer medical services that "Barrio Adentro"
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00001551 004 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>does not provide, and that the public hospitals do not have the
<br>capacity to absorb a massive influx of new patients from the
<br>private clinics. On September 23, deputies for the pro-Chavez
<br>United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) told EmbOffs that
<br>changes to the medical insurance system would be imposed
<br>progressively given the sensitivity of the issue (Ref B).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) The quality of health care in Venezuela has declined as
<br>the GBRV has shifted resources from the traditional medical system
<br>to "Barrio Adentro." Resource-starved public hospitals are
<br>beginning to show the effects of years of neglect. Mismanagement
<br>has increased as military officers and community council
<br>members-usually with little previous experience in health care-have
<br>assumed a greater role in the administration of public hospitals.
<br>At the same time, the hospitals suffer from the same problems that
<br>plague the rest of Venezuelan society, including the deterioration
<br>of infrastructure, an increase in crime, and the flight of the
<br>professional class. Despite these issues, President Chavez and
<br>other members of his cabinet have not publicly acknowledged the
<br>deterioration of the public hospitals or announced any new plans to
<br>revitalize them. To the extent that President Chavez has
<br>acknowledged Venezuela's health care crisis, the GBRV has looked to
<br>"Barrio Adentro" and Cuba-and not the public hospitals-as the
<br>solution.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Meanwhile, "Barrio Adentro" has not proven to be a viable
<br>substitute for the public hospitals despite massive GBRV attention
<br>and investment. Indeed, the evidence suggests that all classes of
<br>Venezuelans continue to prefer public hospitals to "Barrio
<br>Adentro," even as the quality of medical services in the former has
<br>deteriorated. The popular preference for public hospitals means
<br>that the traditional medical system must treat a growing number of
<br>patients with dwindling resources, a problem that will only
<br>intensify if the GBRV decides to eliminate the health care benefit
<br>for public employees, forcing them out of the private clinics and
<br>into the public hospitals. Another possible consequence is the
<br>risk that the GBRV will look to expropriate private sector medical
<br>facilities.
