<br>REF: TEL AVIV 404

<br>Classified By: NEA A/S Jeffrey Feltman for reasons 1.4(b,d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request: see paragraph 3.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Per reftel and other information, the Government of
<br>Israel (GOI) is concerned that Syria intends to imminently
<br>transfer SCUD-D missiles to Hizballah in Lebanon.  We share
<br>this concern.  The transfer of such weapons would constitute
<br>a significant escalation of a potentially volatile situation
<br>that could threaten regional stability.  Embassy is requested
<br>to demarche SARG officials at the highest possible level to
<br>communicate the points below and report responses via front
<br>channel cable.  NEA will deliver the same points to the
<br>Syrian Ambassador upon his return to Washington.  End summary.
<br>
<br>--------------
<br>Action Request
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/REL SYRIA) Post is requested to use the following
<br>points in demarching the SARG on the imminent missile
<br>transfers to Hizballah.  Begin points:
<br>
<br>-- Mr. Vice Minister, Washington has asked me to follow up on
<br>an issue that Under Secretary Burns raised privately with
<br>President Asad last week.  We are growing increasingly
<br>concerned about the risk of a regional military conflict --
<br>one that could have dire consequences for Syria.  We believe
<br>it is in our mutual interests that we share our concerns with
<br>you again.
<br>
<br>-- Just weeks ago, we saw how the war of words between
<br>yourself, Foreign Minister Muallim and the Israelis could
<br>have quickly escalated out of control.  President Asad
<br>assured U/S Burns that Syria had no interest in escalating
<br>the potential for conflict with Israel.  With that assurance,
<br>we want to discuss with you frankly two increasingly
<br>worrisome issues that we believe could spark the next
<br>conflict.
<br>
<br>-- First, we are concerned about Syria's provision of
<br>increasingly sophisticated weapons to Hizballah.  In our
<br>meetings last week it was stated that Syria is not
<br>transferring any "new" missiles to Lebanese Hizballah.  We
<br>are aware, however, of current Syrian efforts to supply
<br>Hizballah with ballistic missiles.  I must stress that this
<br>activity is of deep concern to my government, and we strongly
<br>caution you against such a serious escalation.
<br>
<br>-- Next, we are concerned that Hizballah is still planning an
<br>operation to avenge the death of Imad Mughniyeh.  While
<br>Hizballah may be willing to risk a renewal of the 2006
<br>conflict, it does not seem to be in Syria's interest to
<br>accept that risk.
<br>
<br>-- While Syria's influence over Hizballah's operational
<br>decision-making may be limited, the political reality is such
<br>that a major escalation would surely complicate our efforts
<br>to improve our bilateral relationship, and undermine our
<br>efforts to build political conditions conducive for
<br>re-launching Middle East peace negotiations.  We therefore
<br>urge you to use whatever influence you have to avoid such a
<br>scenario.
<br>
<br>-- Your interest in avoiding war should require you to exert
<br>maximum restraint, including restraining Hizballah and
<br>preventing the group's acquisition of such lethal, long-range
<br>weapons.
<br>
<br>-- Iran and Hizballah both have interests that are not in
<br>Syria's own strategic interest.  I know you are a strategic
<br>thinker, which is why I want to underscore for you that, from
<br>our perspective, your operational support for Hizballah is a
<br>strategic miscalculation that is damaging your long-term
<br>national interests.
<br>
<br>End points.
