<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Coming to power after one of the worst economic,
<br>political and social crises in Argentina's history, President
<br>Nestor Kirchner has had a successful first three years in
<br>office. He is seen as a strong and decisive leader and is
<br>credited with restoring governability to the executive branch
<br>and promoting Argentina's impressive economic recovery.
<br>Kirchner has high public approval ratings and has restored
<br>public optimism in Argentina. Despite these major successes,
<br>Kirchner continues to face considerable challenges in dealing
<br>with poverty, crime, inflation, and the need to attract more
<br>foreign investment and resolve Argentina's long-term energy
<br>shortage. Although Kirchner started his presidency by
<br>strengthening the independence of the Supreme Court, Kirchner
<br>has since then failed to strengthen Argentina's institutional
<br>democracy, and in many cases has weakened it. Kirchner's
<br>reliance on presidential decrees, manipulation of the
<br>electoral system, tightened control over the Judiciary, and
<br>pursuit of permanent "super" budgetary powers have enhanced
<br>presidential power at the expense of Argentina's already weak
<br>institutional framework. Kirchner campaigned in 2003 on a
<br>strong anti-corruption message and his first Justice
<br>Minister, Gustavo Beliz, championed the cause of rooting out
<br>official corruption, but the GOA has placed less emphasis on
<br>fighting corruption since Beliz was fired in 2004. On the
<br>foreign policy front, President Kirchner's lack of attention
<br>and understanding in the international relations arena has
<br>resulted in an erratic GOA foreign policy. The Kirchner
<br>administration's most important foreign policy theme is the
<br>promotion of regional integration, which in practice has
<br>meant the strengthening of relations with Venezuela and
<br>Brazil. End Summary.
<br>
<br>-------------------------
<br>KIRCHNER'S MANY SUCCESSES
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Coming to power after one of the worst economic,
<br>political and social crises in Argentina's history, President
<br>Nestor Kirchner has had a successful first three years in
<br>office. When Kirchner first took office in May 2003, many
<br>analysts doubted he would finish his term. Since that time,
<br>Kirchner has gained full control of the Peronis Party (PJ),
<br>asserted his authority over the military, largely co-opted
<br>the piquetero movement that threatened the stability of past
<br>governments, won control of Congress in the October 2005
<br>elections and maintained high public approval ratings. Not
<br>only is Kirchner's survival no longer in doubt, polls show
<br>that Kirchner would easily win reelection if elections were
<br>held today. Kirchner controls Argentina's political system
<br>and faces a weak and divided opposition. Kirchner has also
<br>proven adept at the traditional Peronist art of co-opting key
<br>elements of the opposition, including a majority of the
<br>opposition governors.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) He is seen as a strong and decisive leader and is
<br>credited with restoring governability to the executive branch
<br>and promoting Argentina's impressive economic recovery.
<br>Polls show that the Argentine public views Kirchner as a
<br>decisive leader who was able to take charge and turn the
<br>country around during a difficult time in Argentine history.
<br>The wave of public demonstrations that stemmed from the
<br>2001-2002 economic crisis that brought presidential authority
<br>in Argentina to one of its lowest ebbs has subsided and
<br>Kirchner has adeptly managed relations with protest leaders.
<br>On the economic front, Argentina has strongly rebounded from
<br>the crisis, with GDP growth rates of 9 percent for the past
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00001594 002 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>three years. Through the GOA's private sector debt deal and
<br>by paying off Argentina's IMF debt, Argentina's external debt
<br>has been brought to a manageable level for the first time in
<br>a decade. Under Kirchner's watch, Argentina has amassed
<br>record budget surpluses. The tax collection system -- a
<br>perennial problem for Argentine governments -- has been
<br>significantly improved, albeit aided by the use of
<br>distortionary taxes like the financial transaction tax and
<br>the export tax. Argentina's move to a market-based exchange
<br>rate regime in 2002 has triggered an export-led boom during
<br>Kirchner's presidency that has been the driving factor behind
<br>robust growth, accompanied by significant declines in
<br>unemployment and poverty levels.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Kirchner has high public approval ratings and has
<br>restored public optimism in Argentina. Kirchner's approval
<br>ratings stand at 65-75 percentage points -- depending on the
<br>poll and how the question is asked -- a historical high for
<br>an Argentine president three years into his term. Polls by
<br>leading Argentine pollsters show that Kirchner receives high
<br>marks for his handling of the economy and for promoting
<br>political stability. Argentines also have developed a
<br>renewed sense of optimism under Kirchner's administration.
<br>In recent polling by a leading opinion research firm, a
<br>plurality of respondents -- 44 percent -- thought that
<br>conditions in Argentina would improve over the coming year,
<br>while only 12 percent thought things would get worse. In
<br>March 2003, the month Kirchner was elected, polling by the
<br>same firm showed that only 29 percent of the population
<br>thought things would get better in the coming year, while 30
<br>percent thought things would get worse.
<br>
<br>-----------------
<br>CHALLENGES REMAIN
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Despite these major successes, Kirchner continues to
<br>face considerable challenges in dealing with persistent
<br>poverty and high crime. Poverty rates have been nearly
<br>halved from almost 60 percent of the population at the height
<br>of the economic crisis to 34 percent today. At the same
<br>time, however, reducing poverty in this traditionally
<br>affluent country continues to be a major social policy
<br>imperative for the Kirchner administration. The continued
<br>problem of inflation -- which stood at 12.3 percent in 2005
<br>and is on track to maintain a double digit rate in 2006 -- is
<br>also of a top GOA concern. The GOA has resorted to price
<br>controls, bullying producers to lower prices, and even banned
<br>the export of beef as a means to control inflation. (See
<br>Septel on evaluating Kirchner's economic policy.) Crime
<br>continues to be a major public focus according to opinion
<br>surveys. Argentines accustomed to minimal crime rates,
<br>particularly in the Greater Buenos Aires area, have since the
<br>economic crisis faced a major problem with street crime, home
<br>invasions, kidnappings and other types of violent crime. The
<br>Capital has had several recent cases of shootings, robberies
<br>and rapes that have garnered a lot of media attention, giving
<br>the public the sensation of a surge in crime. Interior
<br>Minister Anibal Fernandez recently stated that GOA statistics
<br>in fact show that crime is down, but this assertion is
<br>impossible to verify because the GOA has not published
<br>national crime statistics since 2004.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) On the economic front, sustained growth requires
<br>increasing infusions of foreign investment, dealing with the
<br>energy shortage and controlling inflation. Private Direct
<br>Foreign Investment has increased significantly since the
<br>crisis, particularly in the tradable goods and services
<br>industries. Nevertheless, other sectors (e.g. public
<br>services) are badly in need of investment in order to sustain
<br>continued growth. A strategic flaw in the economic equation
<br>continues to be the energy sector. The Kirchner
<br>administration has faced serious pressure from utility
<br>companies and the G-7 to raise utility rates that have been
<br>pesified and then frozen for residential users since the peso
<br>devalued in 2002. So far, the GOA has been unwilling to
<br>raise utility rates for residential users, but Kirchner
<br>recently said he is open to discussions on the issue,
<br>although he made no promises. Without a utility rate
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00001594 003 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>increase, it is doubtful that Argentina will see major new
<br>foreign investments in public utilities in the short-term.
<br>Argentina's gas and electricity production has not kept up
<br>with the rapid growth of demand due to the absence of market
<br>incentives (price) to invest or expand production. (Comment:
<br>Kirchner's unorthodox methods of controlling inflation,
<br>frozen utility rates and hardball tactics with the private
<br>sector may earn Kirchner short-term benefits, but they are
<br>not long-term solutions to Argentina's economic problems
<br>because they scare away foreign investment that Argentina
<br>needs to sustain its economic growth. End Comment.)
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>KIRCHNER WEAK ON SUPPORT FOR INSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Although Kirchner began his presidency by
<br>strengthening the independence of the Supreme Court, his
<br>record since then on institutional-democracy building has
<br>been poor. Upon assuming office, Kirchner moved quickly to
<br>clean up former President Carlos Menem's "automatic majority"
<br>Supreme Court that was widely regarded as corrupt. Kirchner
<br>and his supporters in Congress forced three Menem-era Supreme
<br>Court justices to resign and impeached two others. Kirchner
<br>then appointed four well-respected jurists to succeed them.
<br>However, since that time Kirchner has failed to fill the
<br>remaining vacancies on the high court -- a second vacancy
<br>opened up after another justice retired -- reducing the
<br>effectiveness of the court. (Note: Rulings still require the
<br>support of five justices, which is more difficult to achieve
<br>with only seven instead of nine on the bench. End Note.) A
<br>proposal by legal experts to reduce the number of Supreme
<br>Court justices from nine to five, as it was before Menem's
<br>1990 controversial judicial reform, has not been pursued by
<br>the Kirchner administration.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Over the past year, Kirchner has instigated a number
<br>of actions that have further debilitated Argentina's already
<br>weak democratic institutions. Kirchner has issued hundreds
<br>of presidential decrees during his presidency, preferring to
<br>avoid discussion or delay in Congress, and signed more
<br>decrees in his third year of his presidency than laws
<br>approved by Congress. A new law sponsored by his wife,
<br>Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, nominally is designed to
<br>regulate the presidential-decree-making process. The bill,
<br>which will likely be signed into law shortly, would authorize
<br>presidential decrees that are not voted down by both houses
<br>of Congress. The proposed bill does not set a time limit on
<br>when Congress is required to vote after a presidential decree
<br>is issued and allows decrees to remain in force pending a
<br>congressional vote. (Note: Senator Cristina Kirchner
<br>proposed a bill in 2000 designed to regulate presidential
<br>decrees when Fernando de la Rua of the Radical Civic Union
<br>(UCR) was President. Unlike her current bill, the 2000
<br>Cristina Kirchner bill required Congress to vote on
<br>presidential decrees within 20 days of their issuance and
<br>made the decrees invalid if just one house of Congress voted
<br>against them. Senator Kirchner's bill was not approved in
<br>2000, but UCR Senator Rodolfo Terragno reintroduced
<br>Kirchner's exact bill in the Senate earlier this year, to
<br>which Senator Kirchner responded with the current modified
<br>version of the bill. End Note.) (Comment: Congress'
<br>regulation of presidential decrees is a long-overdue action
<br>that was supposed to be addressed shortly following the 1994
<br>constitutional reform. The current bill will serve to
<br>legitimate what has become an arbitrary use of presidential
<br>powers. Kirchner is not the first president to abuse the use
<br>of presidential decrees, but he has taken their use to new
<br>levels. End Comment.)
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Kirchner and his supporters' manipulation of the
<br>electoral system before and after the October 2005
<br>legislative elections gained them more power in Congress, but
<br>sometimes ran counter to voters' wishes and the spirit of the
<br>Constitution and electoral law. In the October elections,
<br>the ruling PJ party split in five of the eight provinces that
<br>were electing national senators, allowing them to gain all
<br>three Senate seats in the five provinces. (Note: By dividing
<br>in several provinces, and in most cases reuniting after the
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00001594 004 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>election, the PJ circumvented a constitutional provision
<br>reserving a portion of the Senate seats to miniority parties.
<br>Electoral law further stipulates that those parties that
<br>cannot agree on a unified electoral list hold primary
<br>elections to choose candidates, which the PJ did not do in
<br>most provinces. See Reftel A. End Note.) Kirchner's allies
<br>in Congress also prevented right-wing Paufe leader Luis Patti
<br>from taking his seat in Congress due to as yet unproven
<br>allegations of human rights abuses when Patti was a police
<br>commissioner during the last military dictatorship. Patti
<br>was prevented from taking his seat despite a ruling by the
<br>National Electoral Committee prior to the election that there
<br>was nothing preventing Patti from assuming office and despite
<br>the nearly 400,000 people that voted for him in Buenos Aires
<br>province (See Reftel B).
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Kirchner and his allies have used other questionable
<br>tactics that contradicted voters' intentions and have
<br>supporting provincial allies in overturning term limits.
<br>Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez drew newly-elected
<br>congressman for the opposition Republican Proposal (PRO)
<br>Eduardo Lorenzo Borocoto over to Kirchner's bloc by offering
<br>his son a lucrative government job. Several Kirchner
<br>congressmen elected in October never assumed their seats,
<br>such as Jorge Taiana, who became Foreign Minister, and La
<br>Rioja Governor Angel Maza, who left his newly-won Senate seat
<br>to his sister, Ada Maza. Tucuman Governor Jose Alperovich,
<br>with Kirchner's blessing, recently changed his province's
<br>constitution to allow himself to run for reelection.
<br>Kirchner is supporting similar efforts by friendly Governors
<br>in Jujuy and Misiones, and Buenos Aires Governor Felipe Sola
<br>is in discussions with Kirchner to allow him to change the
<br>Buenos Aires Constitution or ensure a favorable legal ruling
<br>so he also can run for reelection next year.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Kirchner has achieved an unprecedented
<br>centralization of decision-making, but has weakened
<br>Argentina's system of checks and balances in the process. In
<br>February 2006, Kirchner and his allies in Congress succeeded
<br>in modifying the Council of Magistrates that regulates the
<br>Argentine judicial system, strengthening the Casa Rosada's
<br>control over the judiciary (See Reftel C). Congress is also
<br>likely to shortly approve granting Cabinet Chief Alberto
<br>Fernandez permanent "super" budgetary powers that will enable
<br>him to freely move funds from one area of the budget to
<br>another without approval from Congress. The opposition in
<br>Congress claim the proposed law will strip Congress of its
<br>fundamental democratic role of controlling the budget and
<br>that these powers are no longer necessary because the
<br>economic crisis is over. The opposition further argues that
<br>the measure is simply designed to allow the GOA to spend
<br>money however it wants during an election year, pointing out
<br>that Alberto Fernandez reassigned ARP 500 million to social
<br>and public works projects just two weeks before the October
<br>2005 legislative elections using these same powers. The
<br>Kirchners have lashed out repeatedly at the press and the
<br>opposition for their criticism of the Casa Rosada's recent
<br>actions in Congress. The GOA claims these are necessary
<br>powers to ensure the smooth functioning of the government.
<br>Regardless of the opposition's objections, the Casa Rosada
<br>appears to have the necessary votes to approve the measure by
<br>early August. (Note: These "super" budgetary powers were
<br>first granted by Congress to the GOA at the start of the
<br>economic crisis in 2001 and were re-approved every year
<br>through the 2005 budget. They were not included in the 2006
<br>budget -- passed before the October elections gave Kirchner
<br>control of Congress -- because of opposition resistance. The
<br>current bill would make these special budgetary powers
<br>permanent. End Note.)
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Kirchner campaigned in 2003 on a strong
<br>anti-corruption message and his first Justice Minister,
<br>Gustavo Beliz, came with impeccable credentials and
<br>championed the cause of rooting out official corruption.
<br>Unfortunately, the GOA has placed less emphasis on fighting
<br>corruption since then. In fact, since Beliz was fired in
<br>2004, Kirchner has avoiding speaking publicly about official
<br>corruption and the much-vaunted new Office of Anti-Corruption
<br>has failed to live up to its envisioned potential. There
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00001594 005 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>also have been credible allegations that Planning Minister
<br>Julio De Vido, a key Kirchner insider, has been involved in
<br>questionable federal and provincial public works contracts
<br>during Kirchner's presidency (See Reftel D).
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>KIRCHNER FOREIGN POLICY SUFFERS FROM NEGLECT
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) President Kirchner's lack of attention and
<br>understanding in the international relations arena has
<br>resulted in an erratic GOA foreign policy. President
<br>Kirchner is not skilled at international diplomacy and relies
<br>on an ever-shrinking group of long-time advisors who lack
<br>foreign policy expertise to make key decisions. Kirchner has
<br>touted Mercosur as a regional alternative to the FTAA, but
<br>his conflict with Uruguay over the construction of two paper
<br>plants has caused a crisis within the trading bloc.
<br>President Kirchner has recently sought closer relations with
<br>Spain, even as he is putting more pressure on Spanish
<br>companies with major investments in Argentina, such as Repsol
<br>and Aerolineas Argentinas. Kirchner has repeatedly thanked
<br>the U.S. for its support to Argentina during the crisis and
<br>sought to strengthen the bilateral relationship after
<br>short-circuits during the Summit of the Americas, but took
<br>the opportunity during a recent press conference in Madrid to
<br>criticize the U.S. and claim that the U.S. left Argentina to
<br>face the crisis alone (See Reftel E).
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) The Kirchner administration's most important foreign
<br>policy theme is the promotion of regional integration, which
<br>in practice has meant the strengthening of relations with
<br>Venezuela and Brazil. Argentina's most important goal during
<br>its recent presidency of Mercosur was the integration of
<br>Venezuela into the trading bloc (See Reftel F). Kirchner's
<br>top officials have repeatedly told Embassy officials that the
<br>GOA's relationship with Venezuela is based on economics and
<br>Mercosur. Kirchner sees Venezuela as a solution for
<br>Argentina's energy and financing problems. Kirchner, who
<br>normally places a low priority on foreign relations, in the
<br>past 12 months has traveled twice to Caracas and hosted
<br>Chavez three times in Argentina. Kirchner will host Chavez
<br>again for the July 20-21 Mercosur Summit in Cordoba,
<br>Argentina. Kirchner has also sought to strengthen relations
<br>with Brazil, recently endorsing Brazilian President Lula's
<br>reelection and signing an accord on automobile sales between
<br>the two countries.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) To his credit, Kirchner has remained committed to
<br>OAS efforts to return Haiti to stability and constitutional
<br>democracy. Senior GOA officials assure us that Argentine
<br>peacekeepers will remain on the island for the long-term.
<br>
<br>
<br>-------
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) President Kirchner has numerous successes to show
<br>after three years in office. The economy is booming and
<br>Argentines feel a level of stability and dignity has been
<br>restored to their country which was lost in the political,
<br>economic and social disaster of 2001-2002. In Kirchner's
<br>first years in office, Argentina needed a strong hand to lead
<br>it out of the depths of crisis. History has shown that
<br>long-term, broad-based economic growth needs to be
<br>accompanied by a strong institutional framework. Now that
<br>the crisis has past, the country needs a leader that is
<br>willing to spend some of his built-up capital to strengthen
<br>Argentina's weak democratic institutions. To date, it is
<br>unclear whether Kirchner has the will or capacity to make
<br>this transition. End Comment
