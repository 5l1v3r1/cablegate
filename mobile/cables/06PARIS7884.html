<br>SUBJECT: FRANCE: 2006 COUNTRY REPORT ON TERRORISM 
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 177128 
<br>
<br>¶1. In 2006, France continued to pursue aggressive 
<br>counterterrorism measures, including the dismantling of 
<br>terror networks on its territory, notably those assisting in 
<br>the recruitment or financing of terrorists to Iraq. French 
<br>terrorism officials remained on high alert since the London 
<br>subway bombings in 2005, and continued to conduct extensive 
<br>investigations into Islamic terrorism on French soil. The 
<br>French government arrested approximately 70 people in 2006 on 
<br>charges related to Islamic terrorism. In September, French 
<br>authorities announced they had arrested their 400th suspect 
<br>in connection with Islamic terrorism since the September 11 
<br>attacks in the U.S. More than 150 of those have been jailed. 
<br>
<br>¶2. In September the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat 
<br>(GSPC) announced its union with al-Qaeda and declared France 
<br>to be its number one target. Several high profile events in 
<br>2006 -- including the local publication of the Danish 
<br>Mohammed cartoon pictorials, heated debate on the 
<br>interdiction of the veil in French public institutions, and 
<br>the presence of French troops in Afghanistan and Lebanon -- 
<br>have been cited by various French authorities as factors 
<br>manipulated by Islamic extremists to incite violence against 
<br>the country. France,s chief counterterrorism judge, 
<br>Jean-Louis Bruguiere, maintains that all terrorist threats 
<br>currently faced by France can be directly linked to Iraq. In 
<br>May, intelligence officials announced that 29 people had been 
<br>detained in France for suspected association with terror 
<br>networks related to Iraq. In September, officials noted that 
<br>at least nine terrorists whose journey to Iraq began in 
<br>France have been killed, with two incarcerated and another 
<br>12-15 likely still engaged in combat against Coalition 
<br>forces. Increasing Islamic radicalization in the local 
<br>prison system also continues to worry French officials. 
<br>
<br>¶3. On January 23 the French government adopted new 
<br>counterterrorism legislation that considerably strengthened 
<br>police powers in criminal law and codified some current 
<br>practices. Preliminary detention for terrorism suspects was 
<br>extended from a maximum of four to up to six days. Current 
<br>legislation allows the state to thereafter place suspects in 
<br>pre-trial detention for up to four years when the evidence is 
<br>strong or when they present an imminent threat. The law 
<br>gives the government additional powers for the freezing of 
<br>assets, video and telephone surveillance, allows increased 
<br>monitoring of public transport records, and grants broader 
<br>powers of official access to connection data held by internet 
<br>cafes and to various personal data records. Sentences for 
<br>convicted terrorists were increased from 20 to 30 years for 
<br>leading or organizing an attack, and from 10 to 20 years for 
<br>assisting a terrorist organization or operation. The new law 
<br>also reinforced existing legislation that allows for the 
<br>revocation of French nationality and eventual expulsion if 
<br>the terrorist became a citizen through naturalization within 
<br>the preceding 15 years. 
<br>
<br>¶4. Under the auspices of the Prime Minister, the French 
<br>government published its White Paper on terrorism on March 7. 
<br>The paper, a publicly available document, sets out the 
<br>government,s overall policy efforts to combat terrorism. It 
<br>includes attack scenarios, threat analyses, and technical as 
<br>well as political responses to terrorism. 
<br>
<br>¶5. At the political and diplomatic level, France continued 
<br>its active engagement with the United Nation,s Security 
<br>Council (UNSC) Counterterrorism Committee (CTC), the G-8,s 
<br>Counter-Terrorism Action Group (CTAG), the UN,s 1267 
<br>Sanctions Committee (for the Taliban and al-Qaeda), and the 
<br>European Council,s Anti-Terrorism Strategy action plan. 
<br>France is a founding member of the joint U.S./Russia Global 
<br>Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism which was inaugurated 
<br>in October. France is a member and contributor to both the 
<br>Proliferation and Container Security Initiatives. The U.S. 
<br>and France maintain regular bilateral counterterrorism 
<br>consultations. France has also signed and ratified 12 of the 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00007884 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>13 UN counterterrorism conventions. It signed, but has not 
<br>yet ratified, the Convention for the Prevention of Acts of 
<br>Nuclear Terrorism. 
<br>
<br>¶6. On the military front, French Special Forces participated 
<br>in coalition operations in Afghanistan as part of Operation 
<br>Enduring Freedom (OEF). France is also a key participant in 
<br>Coalition Task Force (CTF) 150, a multinational naval force 
<br>that patrols the Red Sea and Gulf of Yemen to interdict the 
<br>movement of suspected terrorists between Afghanistan, the 
<br>Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa. It has twice 
<br>commanded the Task Force and will assume command for a third 
<br>time next year. France,s overall contributions in 
<br>Afghanistan increased in 2006 and France currently commands 
<br>the International Security Assistance Force,s (ISAF) 
<br>Regional Command - Kabul. France is also a chief contributor 
<br>to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 
<br>more than 1600 troops, which is under the command of a French 
<br>General through February 2007. UNIFIL,s mission includes 
<br>assisting the Lebanese Armed forces to secure its territory, 
<br>including against Hizballah. 
<br>
<br>¶7. France continued to develop competencies and capabilities 
<br>of TRACFIN, the Ministry of Finance,s terrorism financing 
<br>coordination and investigation unit. Within the European 
<br>Union, France played an active role in the Clearinghouse, the 
<br>EU process for designation terrorist organizations. France 
<br>has not designated HAMAS-affiliated charities, such as the 
<br>French based Comite de Bienfaisance et Secours aux 
<br>Palestiniens (Committee for the Well-Being and Assistance to 
<br>Palestinians), arguing that it has no proven links to 
<br>terrorism. France also continued to oppose any EU 
<br>designation of Lebanese Hizballah as a terrorist 
<br>organization, although it supported Hizballah's eventual 
<br>disarmament, which it maintained would result in Hizballah,s 
<br>gradual integration into Lebanese politics. 
<br>
<br>¶8. The government continued its policy of expelling 
<br>non-French citizens engaged in terrorist activities or speech 
<br>that promoted hate or incited violence. Among those ordered 
<br>expelled from France during 2006 were at least 20 imams from 
<br>Algeria, Bangladesh, Morocco, and Pakistan. Chelali 
<br>Benchellali, an Algerian imam resident in France since 1961, 
<br>was expelled to Algeria in September. He was convicted to 
<br>six months, time served, in June of contributing to a 
<br>Chechnyan network terrorist plot. Several of Benchellali,s 
<br>family members were also convicted on similar terrorism 
<br>charges. His youngest son, Mourad, was a Guantamano detainee 
<br>for more than three years and is still facing trial in France. 
<br>
<br>¶9. The government also exercised its power to repeal French 
<br>citizenship and deport convicted terrorists. Adel Tebourski, 
<br>a Tunisian and French dual-national citizen, who was arrested 
<br>in 2001 and sentenced in 2005 for his contribution to the 
<br>September 9, 2001 assassination of Afghan War Chief Ahmad 
<br>Shah Massood, was stripped of his French nationality by 
<br>decree on July 19, and expelled to Tunisia on August 7. 
<br>Karim Bourti, a French GSPC supporter, was also stripped of 
<br>his citizenship in May. 
<br>
<br>¶10. Since May 2005, the government revoked the security 
<br>clearances of 72 individuals working in private companies at 
<br>Paris, Charles de Gaulle international airport. The majority 
<br>of those were announced in early November 2006. A handful of 
<br>those concerned brought legal action against the government 
<br>and were subsequently reinstated. The government claimed 
<br>that the individuals, while not terrorists, posed a security 
<br>risk to the airport based on background checks that showed 
<br>Islamic extremist sympathies. The Prefect charged with 
<br>governing the area noted that background checks are conducted 
<br>on a regular basis and that a number of security clearances 
<br>are revoked annually. 
<br>
<br>¶11. Key judicial proceedings in 2006 on Islamic terrorism 
<br>related crimes included: 
<br>
<br>
<br>PARIS 00007884 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>- On June 13, 25 Islamic militants tied to a Chechen 
<br>jihad network that allegedly planned to bomb a commercial 
<br>center in Paris and the Eiffel Tower were sentenced in June. 
<br>Several members of the group, including Menad Benchellali and 
<br>Merouane Benhamed, received the maximum sentence of 10 years. 
<br>
<br>- Five of six former Guantanamo detainees who were 
<br>expelled to France in 2004 and 2005 are currently no longer 
<br>in detention (they were initially detained for many months 
<br>after their arrival in France). Brahim Yadel, however, 
<br>remains in custody for violating the terms of his conditional 
<br>release. All six former detainees face further charges in 
<br>France for terrorist conspiracy. In September 2006 the trial 
<br>was halted when a judge ordered further investigations into 
<br>the role of alleged visits of French intelligence authorities 
<br>to Guantanamo. The trial is scheduled to reconvene on May 2, 
<br>¶2007. 
<br>
<br>- Karim Mehdi, a Moroccan national, was sentenced to nine 
<br>years on October 26 for terrorism related activities. Mehdi 
<br>is alleged to have ties with September 11 terrorists (Ramzi 
<br>bin al Shaibah and Ziad Jarrah) and is suspected of planning 
<br>an attack on the island of Reunion in 2003. Mehdi will also 
<br>be deported following his sentence and not allowed in France 
<br>for a minimum of six years. 
<br>
<br>- Rachid Ramda, who was extradited to France from the UK 
<br>in December 2005 after ten years in detention, was sentenced 
<br>to ten years on March 29 for his role in the 1995 Paris 
<br>subway and train attacks. 
<br>
<br>- On November 12, France,s chief counterterrorism judge, 
<br>Jean-Louis Bruguiere, sent the cases of three suspects 
<br>allegedly connected to the 2002 Djerba, Tunisia attacks, to 
<br>the Paris Court of Assizes. Khalid Cheik Mohammed, Christian 
<br>Ganczarski and Walid Nawar are suspected of assisting 
<br>convicted terrorist Belgacem Nawar in the Djerba al-Qaeda 
<br>attacks whose victims included two French citizens. Cheik 
<br>Mohammed remains in U.S. custody at Guantanamo. 
<br>
<br>¶12. Three individuals were detained in France in late 
<br>November (two on November 25 and one on November 29) after 
<br>being expelled from Syria. They are suspected of attempting 
<br>to transit through Syria in order to join insurgents fighting 
<br>against Coalition forces in Iraq. Another nine individuals 
<br>were deported from Egypt in mid-December under similar same 
<br>charges. However all were released after a brief period of 
<br>detention. 
<br>
<br>¶13. French police cooperated closely with Spanish authorities 
<br>in the Basque region throughout 2006. Several arms caches 
<br>were discovered in France, and a number of arrests of Basque 
<br>Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) suspects were made throughout 
<br>the year. Several were extradited to Spain. One attack, 
<br>allegedly claimed by Ipparetarek or an Ipparetarak 
<br>sympathizer (a defunct French Basque nationalist group), 
<br>occurred in France on June 11 against the Hotel Ostap, owned 
<br>by famed chef Alain Ducasse. There were no injuries and only 
<br>minimal damage. 
<br>
<br>¶14. During the first six months of 2006, 176 attacks or 
<br>attempted attacks occurred on the French island of Corsica. 
<br>112 of those were claimed by the National Front for the 
<br>Liberation of Corsica- Combatants Union, or by the National 
<br>Front for the Liberation of Corsica of October 22. Three 
<br>people, including two military personnel, were superficially 
<br>wounded in 2006. Three terrorists were killed during the 
<br>year by accident while attempting to carry out attacks. The 
<br>government has a widespread police presence in the region and 
<br>arrested dozens of people throughout the year in connection 
<br>with various attacks. The groups tend to target secondary 
<br>residences, and avoid serious damage or casualties. 
<br>Separatist groups appear to have largely given up their 
<br>political battle for independence but continue to wage an 
<br>intimidation campaign aimed at foreigners or mainland French 
<br>citizens interested in permanent residence or secondary homes
