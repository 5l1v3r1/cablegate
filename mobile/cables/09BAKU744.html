<br>Summary 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The Kashgai are a little-studied, semi-nomadic 
<br>Turkic minority in Iran with a history of anti-government 
<br>resistance. Recent interviews with Kashgai members, 
<br>supplemented with information from other Iranians, suggest 
<br>that most of the 1.5 million Kashgai, while still poorly 
<br>educated and impoverished, are adapting to many aspects of 
<br>modern life, including the internet. While many Kashgai 
<br>still seek to preserve their traditional migratory ways, 
<br>urbanization of Kashgai appears to be increasing. Tehran's 
<br>abandonment of forced settlement policies in favor of 
<br>economic incentives for those who wish to settle, and 
<br>improved education and economic infrastructure, has reduced 
<br>Kashgai-Tehran tension, and encouraged voluntary settlement 
<br>trends. Memories of the brutal repression of Kashgai 
<br>resistors in the 1980's, combined with improved economic 
<br>status and increased integration with the outside world have 
<br>also reduced temptations toward unrest. Today, only about 
<br>one third of the Kashgai are actively maintaining their 
<br>traditional tribal and migratory lifestyle, though cultural 
<br>traditions remain strong. Though proud to be Kashgai, there 
<br>is no meaningful autonomy movement, and self identification 
<br>of Kashgai as also being "Iranians" is increasing. According 
<br>to sources, most Kashgai are satisfied with the current 
<br>system and probably voted for Ahmadinejad. Once the stuff of 
<br>village nightmares, the modern Kashgai are largely 
<br>apolitical, peaceful, patriotically Iranian, and the object 
<br>of increasing tourism. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Baku Iran watcher met separately with two Iranian 
<br>Kashgai minority members,xxxxxxxxxxxx Both grew up in traditional Kashgai 
<br>households (though the former ran away to be educated as a 
<br>teenager). Taken together, the two sources (both unknown to 
<br>each other), provided interesting social and political 
<br>perspectives on this significant but comparatively 
<br>little-known Iranian minority group. The following account 
<br>of current life and attitudes among the Kashgai is taken from 
<br>these interviews and supplementary conversations with 
<br>non-Kashgai Iranians. 
<br>
<br>Lords of the Mountains 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The Kashgai (AKA Qashgai) are a 400-year old Turkic 
<br>language tribal confederation numbering approximately 1.5 
<br>million people. Their lifestyle, still pursued by a majority 
<br>of members, is based on nomadic sheep and goat herding. 
<br>Traditionally famed as fiercely independent "Lords of the 
<br>(Zagros) Mountains," the Turkish-speaking Kashgai 
<br>historically maintained a tense relationship with the mainly 
<br>Persian-speaking villagers and farmers through whose 
<br>territory they traveled, traded, and (sometimes) raided, and 
<br>by whom they were regarded with hostility and fear. Today, 
<br>about a third of the Kashgai herders and their families still 
<br>live a semi-nomadic lifestyle, moving over 300 kilometers 
<br>twice a year between summer and winter pasture areas located 
<br>outside of Isfahan and Shiraz, respectively. Other Kashgai 
<br>have combined herding with sedentary farming, or moved to 
<br>urban centers or abroad. Some of these remain sentimentally 
<br>attached to the old lifestyle, and seek to maintain ties with 
<br>it in some fashion. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Thirty years ago the twice-a-year seasonal trek 
<br>took three months each way; now some Kashgai travel in two 
<br>days by truck to the pasture areas, and make camp while 
<br>awaiting the arrival of the herds (which are sometimes also 
<br>moved by truck, but over a longer time period, stopping 
<br>frequently for road side forage). Camels and horses are 
<br>still part of Kashgai life, but reportedly are more and more 
<br>regarded as "status symbols" items rather than necessities. 
<br>Families often pool income, and sources noted that some 
<br>normally city-based wage earners also return for short 
<br>periods to participate in festivals and assist with the herd 
<br>movement and resettlement. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) The Kashgai are historically among Iran's most 
<br>turbulent minority groups, engaging in repeated twentieth 
<br>century incidents of massive armed resistance against central 
<br>
<br>BAKU 00000744 002 of 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>government policies and control as late as 1982; a Persian 
<br>Isfahani related that his grandfather was decorated by the 
<br>Shah for organizing local villagers to fight them. 
<br>Long-standing efforts by the Iranian state to force their 
<br>permanent settlement were largely abandoned after the fall of 
<br>the Shah, when many forcibly settled Kashgai abandoned 
<br>farming and returned to their traditional herding ways. 
<br>Although the Kashgai's previously exiled, anti-Shah 
<br>traditional leaders were initially embraced by Khomeinei, 
<br>they rejected Islamic rule and perceived efforts by the new 
<br>regime to enforce settlement. After a government-broken 
<br>peace treaty, the returned exile Khosrow Khan and many other 
<br>prominent Kashgai (including its Majlis members) were hanged 
<br>by the Revolutionary Guard in 1982. The last widely accepted 
<br>Ilkhan (tribal high chief) renounced politics, and died a 
<br>natural death in 1984. The Persian Isfahani said that today 
<br>the Kashgai are widely viewed by other Iranians as a "simple, 
<br>honest, hospitable people who are easy to cheat." 
<br>
<br>"The Days of the Khans are Over" 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) While both sources said that hereditary tribal and 
<br>clan leaders still command respect, and often serve as 
<br>informal adjudicators on internal Kashgai matters, xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>stated flatly that "the day of the Khans is over." xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>claimed that while Khosrow Khan is still regarded as 
<br>a hero by many Kashgai, mentioning his name in public is 
<br>forbidden," and could lead to arrest or other problems. He 
<br>stressed that most Kashgai are not focused on politics, 
<br>although asserting that awareness of and pride in their 
<br>cultural distinctiveness is high. He added that increased 
<br>literacy, internet access, tourism, and a growing 
<br>international diaspora have buttressed previously declining 
<br>cultural practices, especially handicrafts, dancing, and 
<br>music. He said that he himself is active with urbanized and 
<br>diaspora Kashgai in creating websites and publishing 
<br>magazines targeting a Kashgai audience. He also helps market 
<br>Kashgai international and domestic tour packages that include 
<br>sleeping in tents, dancing and music performances, hiking and 
<br>riding excursions, etc. "Economics is achieving what force 
<br>could not achieve," observed xxxxxxxxxxxx. 
<br>
<br>Liking Karroubi, Voting Ahmedinejad 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Both sources opined that the large majority of 
<br>Kashgai personally like Mehdi Karroubi, regarding him 
<br>favorably as an ethnic Lur with sympathy and understanding 
<br>for their traditions. However, both stressed that most 
<br>Kashgai are apolitical and pragmatic, and focused on their 
<br>immediate personal situation, not larger issues. For this 
<br>reason, they opined that most Kashgai probably voted for 
<br>Ahmadinejad, as a result of gratitude for improved health, 
<br>education, and infrastructure services and/or monetary 
<br>inducements. Overall, they opined that most Kashgai have 
<br>little interest in the election issue, seeing it as "Tehran's 
<br>business." 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Both sources related approvingly that since the 
<br>mid-1980,s the central regime has moved away from forced 
<br>settlement to more relaxed and nuanced policies allowing 
<br>peaceful herding to be pursued, but offering economic and 
<br>social incentives (including free housing, electricity, and 
<br>cash subsidies) for those who are willing to settle. 
<br>Education is mandatory for all children until the age of 
<br>twelve; many are taught in tent schools by teachers 
<br>(sometimes also Kashgai) who travel with the community. The 
<br>merchant said that school curricula include instruction in 
<br>officially "correct" Islamic religious beliefs and rituals, 
<br>and "teach Persian (not Kashgai) history, language, and 
<br>culture." According to sources, few Kashgai focus on 
<br>religion or seek clerical careers, and mostly Persian mullahs 
<br>who teach religion or visit to proselytize are "tolerated," 
<br>but not followed. Kashgai women work outside and do not 
<br>wear the chador except when visiting towns. 
<br>
<br>Economic Conditions 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Both sources noted that pursuit of education beyond 
<br>age twelve is becoming more common, though this often 
<br>requires abandonment of the transhumant lifestyle, and is 
<br>still resisted by some adults as a source of alienation. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>Defying clan elders runs the risk of becoming an outcast. 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx who ran away at sixteen, to avoid a forced marriage 
<br>and obtain further education, said that it took many years 
<br>for him to reforge links to the community. Both said that 
<br>many young Kashgai males now seek work as unskilled labor in 
<br>the cities, providing remittances and returning periodically 
<br>to help out the family. Many of these end up in Turkey, 
<br>where employment opportunities are better and their native 
<br>language is understood. Others try to make it to Europe or 
<br>North America, legally or not. He noted that most young 
<br>Kashgai are internet-literate, and are utilizing the internet 
<br>to create and follow Kashgai websites promoting information 
<br>on Kashgai traditions and culture, connecting to the 
<br>diaspora, and assisting with job searches and other economic 
<br>issues. He said that Kashgai young also use the internet to 
<br>tap into international mass (mainly youth) culture sites xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>claimed that many young herders "follow the NBA... and 
<br>listen to rap." 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Some Kashgai seek education to become health 
<br>workers or teachers, others become unskilled workers or seek 
<br>work with traders shuttling back and forth from towns where 
<br>they specialize in selling Kashgai carpets and handicrafts to 
<br>Iranians and foreigners. The resulting remittances are used 
<br>by their families to buy trucks and other more expensive hard 
<br>goods; less expensive hard goods and consumables are still 
<br>acquired through barter of fresh meat and live sheep to 
<br>(mainly Persian) villagers and merchants. Government 
<br>subsidies, good prices for lamb and wool, and sale of 
<br>handicrafts have combined to increase Kashgai prosperity in 
<br>recent years, though most are still impoverished. While 
<br>Kashgai carpets are world renowned, xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>observed that most of the income from this business does not 
<br>reach the Kashgai, since most of the Kashgai handicraft 
<br>business is in the hands of non-Kashgai merchants and 
<br>government buyers. xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed that Kashgai 
<br>carpets that take several months to make and retail for more 
<br>than a thousand dollars typically earn its (generally female) 
<br>maker as little as fifty dollars. 
<br>
<br>"We are Iranians" 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Despite sporadic central government efforts to 
<br>obstruct tribal movements, enforce Persian norms of Islam and 
<br>strict dress codes for women, and exact excessive bribes, 
<br>both sources denied that severe state-Kashgai tensions exist, 
<br>and portrayed the Kashgai as politically quiescent since the 
<br>1980,s. They stressed that, unlike other traditionally 
<br>restive Iranian minorities (e.g., Baluchis, Kurds, and Arabs) 
<br>there is no significant Kashgai separatist or autonomy 
<br>movement. The sources noted that, in contrast to these 
<br>Sunni-majority groups, the Kashgai, like most Persians, are 
<br>overwhelmingly Sh'ia and thus do not suffer the religious 
<br>discrimination reportedly experienced by Sunni Iranians. 
<br>They also pointed out that, unlike other minorities, the 
<br>Kashgai are not linked to populations in other countries, 
<br>have no written language (obviating many cultural issues), 
<br>and have no historical "national" ideology. In addition, 
<br>they noted, both urbanized and traditional transhumant 
<br>Kashgai are increasingly tied to and dependent on the larger 
<br>Iranian economy and their Persian neighbors. Instead the 
<br>carpet merchant asserted, "we are not Persians, but we ARE 
<br>Iranians."
