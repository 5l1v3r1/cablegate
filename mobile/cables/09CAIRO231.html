<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR REQUESTED  EGYPTIAN FM ABOUL GHEIT 
<br>MEETING WITH THE SECRETARY 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey 
<br>for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Madame Secretary, Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit has 
<br>been looking forward to meeting you since your nomination was 
<br>first announced.  The Egyptian leadership, including 
<br>President Mubarak, are encouraged by the Administration's 
<br>immediate attention to the Middle East and your and the 
<br>President's early outreach to them. Overall, the Egyptians 
<br>believe they did not receive fair treatment from the previous 
<br>Administration and hope to see improvements.  Aboul Gheit 
<br>likely will explain Egypt's "soft power"--its ability to 
<br>influence regional events without benefit of deep pockets. 
<br>He likely will focus more on the strategic challenges of the 
<br>region--the peace process and Iran--but may also address some 
<br>pending bilateral matters.  He may ask for your support for 
<br>Egypt to be part of an expanded G8 or G20 and press the 
<br>candidacy of Egyptian Culture Minister Farouq Hosny for 
<br>Director General of UNESCO.  He may not raise human rights 
<br>(specifically Ayman Nour), political reform, or 
<br>democratization; but you should.  Aboul Gheit will want to 
<br>discuss Gaza, including smuggling and counter-tunneling; 
<br>Iran; and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  On Iraq and 
<br>counter-terrorism, we and the Egyptians see largely 
<br>eye-to-eye; intelligence cooperation is close and effective; 
<br>and our military-to-military relationship is durable but 
<br>stuck in a force-on-force mindset. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Summary continued:  Aboul Gheit is smart, urbane, 
<br>with a tendency to lecture and to avoid discussing Egyptian 
<br>failings with all-purpose recourse to Egyptian sovereign 
<br>pride. However, because this is his first meeting with you 
<br>and it is in Washington, he may be more inclined to listen. 
<br>You should thank him for Egypt's continuing regional 
<br>leadership, in particular regarding their efforts to bring 
<br>about a ceasefire in Gaza, and press him for Egypt to 
<br>continue to use their influence and good offices to achieve a 
<br>permanent solution to intra-Palestinian infighting and 
<br>conflict.  You should also stress the need for Egypt to more 
<br>effectively insure that Hamas cannot rearm via smuggling 
<br>across -- or tunneling under -- the border with Gaza.  Aboul 
<br>Gheit will press for your attendance at the March 2 Gaza 
<br>Donors Conference in Cairo, and may complain about unhelpful 
<br>Qatari and Syrian behavior.  He will also want to explore US 
<br>intentions towards Iran; President Mubarak told Senator 
<br>Mitchell during his recent visit here that he did not oppose 
<br>our talking with the Iranians, as long as "you don't believe 
<br>a word they say."  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>Respect and Appreciation 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) In terms of regional affairs, Special Middle East 
<br>Envoy Senator George Mitchell struck the right chord during 
<br>his recent visit to Cairo when he told President Mubarak that 
<br>he was here to "listen and hear your advice."  The Egyptians 
<br>have long felt that, at best, we take them for granted; and 
<br>at worst, we deliberately ignore their advice while trying to 
<br>force our point of view on them.  You may wish to thank Aboul 
<br>Gheit for the vital role Egypt played in bringing about a 
<br>ceasefire in Gaza, and its efforts at making it last.  You 
<br>should ask him what the current state of play is between 
<br>Hamas and Fatah and have him describe Egypt's vision of the 
<br>future for the Palestinians, both among their factions, and 
<br>vis a vis Israel.  Note:  Although the Egyptians will react 
<br>well to overtures of respect and appreciation, Egypt is very 
<br>often a stubborn and recalcitrant ally.  In addition, Egypt's 
<br>self-perception as the "indispensable Arab state" is 
<br>contingent on Egyptian effectiveness on regional issues, 
<br>including Sudan, Lebanon, and Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>Egypt and the Israel-Palestinian Conflict 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Although Aboul Gheit was never enthusiastic about 
<br>the Annapolis Peace process, resolution of the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains the primary strategic 
<br>political goal for the Egyptians.  They are proud of their 
<br>role as intermediary, well aware that they are perhaps the 
<br>only player that can talk with us, the Israelis, and all 
<br>Palestinian factions.  Mubarak hates Hamas, and considers 
<br>them the same as Egypt's own Muslim Brotherhood, which he 
<br>sees as his own most dangerous political threat.  Since the 
<br> 
<br>CAIRO 00000231  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>June 2007 Hamas takeover of Gaza, the Egyptians, under the 
<br>leadership of intelligence chief Omar Soliman (the de facto 
<br>national security advisor with direct responsibility for the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian account) have shifted their focus to 
<br>intra-Palestinian reconciliation and establishment of the 
<br>Hamas-Israel ceasefire.  Soliman brokered a half-year-long 
<br>truce last year, which Hamas broke in December, leading to 
<br>the Israeli invasion of Gaza.  He has recently re-started 
<br>those efforts, with the goal of getting Hamas to agree to a 
<br>year-long ceasefire, which should give the Egyptians space to 
<br>bring about their political goal of Palestinian 
<br>reconciliation under a technocratic, non-partisan government 
<br>headed by President Mahmoud Abbas. 
<br> 
<br>---------------- 
<br>Gaza and Tunnels 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Smuggling through the Sinai Peninsula and into Gaza 
<br>is an old and complicated problem for Egypt.  Egypt views a 
<br>well-armed and powerful Hamas as a national security threat, 
<br>a point driven home in dramatic fashion by the January 2008 
<br>border breach when Hamas bulldozed the old border fence and 
<br>more than half a million Palestinians poured into Egypt, 
<br>unchecked and hungry.  Since the closure of the Egypt-Gaza 
<br>border following the June 2007 Gaza takeover by Hamas, most 
<br>smuggling of consumer goods and weapons has gone underground. 
<br> The narrow corridor between Egypt and Gaza is as 
<br>honey-combed with subterranean passageways as a gigantic ant 
<br>colony. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Although it is not directly in Aboul Gheit's 
<br>bailiwick, belonging more to the security and intelligence 
<br>forces, nonetheless the issue of tunnels and rearming Hamas 
<br>is the subject of intense scrutiny (by Israel and the 
<br>Congress), and sensitivity (by the Egyptians).  Long 
<br>criticized by Israel for "not doing enough" to halt arms 
<br>smuggling via tunnels, the Egyptians have stopped complaining 
<br>and started acting.  Egypt has increased efforts to counter 
<br>arms smuggling by accelerating its $23 million FMF-funded 
<br>tunnel detection program along the Egypt-Gaza border and 
<br>requesting U.S. support to purchase four backscatter X-Ray 
<br>machines to scan vehicles entering the Sinai for weapons and 
<br>explosives (note Aboul Ghait may not be of this 
<br>EGIS-originated request).  Egypt also continues to cooperate 
<br>with Israel, especially via intelligence sharing, to prevent 
<br>militants from Hamas and other extremist organizations from 
<br>crossing the Gaza border, and on thwarting militant activity 
<br>in Egypt. Egyptian efforts are all justified under President 
<br>Mubarak's pledge that Egypt with "protect its borders." 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Egypt will not take any action that could be 
<br>perceived as collaboration in Israel's siege of Gaza, and 
<br>they have been hyper-sensitive to any suggestion that 
<br>foreigners are assisting them or overseeing their efforts to 
<br>counter smuggling. Aboul Gheit publicly distanced Egypt from 
<br>our January MOU with Israel to combat arms smuggling into 
<br>Gaza, although he knew about it in advance and consulted with 
<br>Secretary Rice and me about its contents.  The Egyptians do 
<br>not want to be stuck holding the Gaza bag, and must be able 
<br>to point the finger of blame at Israel for the plight of the 
<br>Palestinians.  At the same time, Egypt has withstood scathing 
<br>and widespread criticism in the Arab world for refusing to 
<br>open the Rafah border crossing to supply Gaza.  Even during 
<br>the height of the December fighting, the Egyptians only sent 
<br>medicine and medical supplies through the Rafah border; all 
<br>other humanitarian goods went through the Israeli crossing at 
<br>Kerem Shalom.  They likewise insist that Rafah will only 
<br>reopen to handle Gazan travellers when the Gazan side is 
<br>under PA control with EU observers according to the 2005 AMA. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Ultimately, Egypt believes that the only realistic 
<br>and viable solution to erode Hamas' power and stop arms 
<br>smuggling is the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza 
<br>and the opening of Gaza's border to legitimate trade.  While 
<br>in the short term we can best assist the Egyptians with 
<br>technical know-how and training, long term counter smuggling 
<br>success will depend on reducing the financial incentives to 
<br>smuggling by providing the Sinai Bedouin with legitimate 
<br>economic opportunities and by regularly opening the Gaza 
<br>borders to trade, thereby reducing economic incentives to 
<br>smuggle. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>The March 2 Gaza Donors Conference 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/NF) President Mubarak told Senator Mitchell that he 
<br> 
<br>CAIRO 00000231  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>wanted to personally invite you to the March 2 Gaza Donors 
<br>Conference in Cairo.  Aboul Gheit will press hard for you to 
<br>accept this invitation.  He is keen to keep up the momentum 
<br>on Gaza reconstruction and for Egypt to be seen as taking the 
<br>lead in helping the Palestinians.  It is very important to 
<br>him that this conference be at the ministerial level, and he 
<br>will be disappointed if you are unable to accept. 
<br> 
<br>------------- 
<br>Iraq and Iran 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S/NF) President Mubarak enjoys recounting for visiting 
<br>members of Congress how he warned former President Bush 
<br>against invading Iraq, ending with, "I told you so!" and a 
<br>wag of his finger.  In addition, there are Egyptian 
<br>misgivings about Nuri Al-Maliki and Shia majority rule in 
<br>Iraq.  Egypt therefore will need additional prodding to 
<br>continue to take steps to help  rehabilitate Iraq into the 
<br>greater Arab world.  You should ask Aboul Gheit when he plans 
<br>to fully open the Egyptian embassy in Baghdad and exchange 
<br>accredited ambassadors with Iraq (the first Egyptian 
<br>ambassador to post-Saddam Iraq was assassinated).  As for 
<br>Iran, Mubarak has a visceral hatred for the Islamic Republic, 
<br>referring repeatedly to Iranians as "liars," and denouncing 
<br>them for seeking to destabilize Egypt and the region.  He 
<br>sees the Syrians and Qataris as sycophants to Tehran and 
<br>liars themselves.  There is no doubt that Egypt sees Iran and 
<br>its greatest long-term threat, both as it develops a nuclear 
<br>capability and as it seeks to export its "Shia revolution." 
<br>Nonetheless, Mubarak told Mitchell pointedly that he did not 
<br>oppose the U.S. speaking to the Iranians, as long as we did 
<br>not "believe a single word they say."  Aboul Gheit will be 
<br>keen to hear your description of U.S. intentions towards 
<br>Iran. In his conversation with Senator Mitchell, Aboul Gheit 
<br>carefully noting he was speaking personally, expressed more 
<br>interest into bringing the Syrians into negotiations again; 
<br>President Mubarak was not enthusiastic about dealing with the 
<br>Syrians at this time. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>U.S. Assistance to Egypt 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S/NF) The greatest Egyptian outrage a year ago -- 
<br>Congressional conditioning of $100 million of U.S. assistance 
<br>to Egypt -- may now be moot, according to our latest 
<br>understanding of the state of play with the FY2009 
<br>appropriations language.  Beyond the issue of conditioning, 
<br>the Egyptians resent the U.S. unilateral decision to cut ESF 
<br>in half, from $415 million in FY-08 to $200 million in FY-09, 
<br>a level which the Egyptians find embarrassing, not because 
<br>they need the money (they say), but because it shows our 
<br>diminished view of the value of our relationship.  In my 
<br>view, it is important to the U.S. to continue an ESF program 
<br>aimed at health, education, and poverty eradication to 
<br>demonstrate concern for the Egyptian people as opposed to a 
<br>strictly military assistance program. Egypt has also been 
<br>unhappy with the use of these funds to support democracy in 
<br>Egypt.  It would be useful if you could urge that Egypt 
<br>accept the FY 2009 levels so that we can proceed to program 
<br>funds to benefit Egypt, while promising to engage in a 
<br>serious review of the conflicts that exist and a desire to 
<br>resolve them as soon as possible. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (S/NF) Concerning military assistance, the Egyptian 
<br>political and military leadership feel that they have been 
<br>"short changed" by our holding to an FMF level of $1.3 
<br>billion, (the same level for 30 years despite inflation), and 
<br>which they contrast with increases to our military assistance 
<br>to Israel.  Finally, Egypt seeks a higher profile in 
<br>international financial circles (Finance Minister Youssef 
<br>Boutros Ghali was recently named Chairman of the IMF's 
<br>policy-setting committee, the IMFC, the first from a 
<br>developing country), and Aboul Gheit is likely to ask for 
<br>your support to include Egypt in expanded G8 and G20 fora. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>Ayman Nour and Saad Eddin Ibrahim 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (S/NF) Egypt's political leadership considers our public 
<br>chastisement of their treatment of jailed former opposition 
<br>Al Ghad party leader Ayman Nour as interfering with internal 
<br>affairs and infringement on national sovereignty.  Mubarak 
<br>takes this issue personally, and it makes him seethe when we 
<br>raise it, particularly in public.  Aboul Gheit's view is that 
<br>we have made Ayman Nour a freedom martyr, and a damaging (and 
<br> 
<br>CAIRO 00000231  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>distorting) prism through which we view our relationship with 
<br>Egypt.  Much the same can be said about Saad Eddin Ibrahim, 
<br>the outspoken political science professor and democracy 
<br>activist who is in self-imposed exile in the U.S. because of 
<br>spurious law suits brought against him for allegedly defaming 
<br>Egypt.  In a negative development in late January, Egypt,s 
<br>Attorney General-equivalent took action to advance the only 
<br>criminal case pending against Ibrahim.  You should press 
<br>Aboul Gheit hard on Nour and Ibrahim, and also urge the GOE 
<br>to stop arresting other less prominent political activists. 
<br>Nour's health is bad and he has served more than half his 
<br>sentence; he deserves a humanitarian pardon. You may wish to 
<br>lay down a marker for a future discussion on democratization 
<br>and human rights concerns.  You might note that although you 
<br>and the President want to improve the relationship, Egypt 
<br>could take some steps to remove these very volatile issues 
<br>from the agenda. 
<br> 
<br>------------ 
<br>Farouq Hosny 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S/NF) Egypt has mounted a full-scale international 
<br>campaign to support the candidacy of Culture Minister Farouq 
<br>Hosny for Director General of UNESCO.  The Arab League and 
<br>the African Union have already publicly stated their 
<br>commitment to Hosny, and the Egyptians believe they also have 
<br>the support of several Europeans, notably the French.  Aboul 
<br>Gheit will also seek US support -- or, at least, not to 
<br>actively oppose -- the candidacy of Farouq Hosny as the next 
<br>Director General of UNESCO.  The U.S. informed him last year 
<br>that we could not support the candidacy and urged Egypt to 
<br>put forward another name. Abould Gheit will argue Hosny's 
<br>merits for facing down the Islamic extremists who want to 
<br>narrow the space in Egypt for artistic expression.  U.S. 
<br>objections have been to statements Hosny has made that 
<br>"Israel had no culture. . .it stole cultural ideas from 
<br>others and claimed them as its own" and other objectionable 
<br>remarks.  If we plan to derail the Hosny candidacy, we must 
<br>provide a credible alternate, preferably an Arab and/or 
<br>Muslim.
