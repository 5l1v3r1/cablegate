<br>¶B. 08 BAGHDAD 3654 
<br>
<br>Classified By: xxxxx for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d
<br>)
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is a xxxxx reporting cable.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) SUMMARY: xxxxx met with local leader Sheikh xxxxx. During our lengthy discussions the
<br>Sheikh shared his belief that the USG has poorly utilized its
<br>influence in Iraq, leaving the way open for Iran to advance
<br>its agenda at USG expense. He went on to describe Iranian
<br>government attempts to buy his influence on a recent trip he
<br>made to Iran. End Summary.
<br>
<br>A new twist on &what happens in vegas, stays in vegas8
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>¶3. (S) Sheikh xxxxx on January 13 to
<br>discuss his recent trip to Iran. He told the xxxxx that he has
<br>been courted by Iranian officials in an effort to garner more
<br>support and influence among well-placed Iraqis in the middle
<br>Euphrates area. He noted that the &handler8 for the tribal
<br>leaders in this area is xxxxx, who has long
<br>family ties locally.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) The public reason for xxxxx trip to Tehran
<br>was for a medical check-up. He privately told xxxxx that his trip was more for pleasure
<br>than medical treatment and included one or more short-term
<br>&marriages8 (i.e. with state-sanctioned prostitutes) and
<br>other entertainment. xxxxx shared that other (unnamed)
<br>tribal leaders had enjoyed similar privileges while guests of
<br>the Iranian regime recently.
<br>
<br>Dashed expectations
<br>-------------------
<br>¶5. (S) The Sheikh suggested that some Iraqi figures are more
<br>susceptible to Iranian influence because of disillusionment
<br>with the United States. During the meeting with xxxxx asked repeatedly, &Why have the Americans let us
<br>down?8 After he and other tribal sheikhs visited the White
<br>House and met then-President Bush in 2008, he expected to
<br>benefit financially from the Americans. Instead, he
<br>suggested that the Americans did nothing for him, even after
<br>he reported on Iranian activities in Muthanna (Ref A). &The
<br>United States did not secure their friends, the sheikhs,
<br>financially, and has left them vulnerable to Iranian
<br>temptations.8
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) xxxxx also complained that while tribal leaders
<br>in fairly stable areas used their influence to help minimize
<br>insurgent activities over the past several years, they have
<br>received nothing for their efforts. Cooperative sheikhs in
<br>insurgent hotbeds like Anbar, in contrast, received benefits
<br>from the Americans. xxxxx cited Abu Risha as an
<br>example, noting he received money, projects, and other
<br>perquisites for his cooperation. He finished by noting that
<br>several of the White House-invited tribal leaders have been
<br>quietly grumbling. He states that he has had conversations
<br>on this perceived inequity with parliamentarian xxxxx from Diwaniyah.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Additionally, xxxxx was frustrated with
<br>the current regime in Baghdad. He stated that the United
<br>States' support of the Maliki government has only increased
<br>Iran's influence in Iraq, enabling operatives to influence
<br>political decisions and diminish national sovereignty. The
<br>Iraqi government has not made progress in fighting poverty,
<br>it has failed to provide essential services, and it is full
<br>of corruption. He asked if the United States is supporting
<br>Iran. &Why? Because you have American troops on the
<br>ground, but you are advancing Iranian interests without
<br>costing them anything.8
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>¶8. (S) PRT COMMENT: Southern Iraqi sheikhs are well known
<br>Q8. (S) PRT COMMENT: Southern Iraqi sheikhs are well known
<br>for shifting their loyalties based on financial
<br>considerations. PM Maliki's Isnad/Tribal Support Councils
<br>are particularly noteworthy in this regard. Susceptible
<br>sheikhs will trade their influence for financial support
<br>especially if the sheikh is not independently wealthy.
<br>(Note: xxxxx and
<br>does not independently enjoy a large bankroll. End note.)
<br>In turn, the sheikh can mobilize supporters, when needed
<br>(e.g. Ref B). The influence, however, is rented and not
<br>bought. If the financial contributions suddenly stop, much
<br>of the support may also cease. xxxxx considers this true
<br>for Iranian influence in the region as well. If Iran
<br>continues to pay for support among influential sheikhs, the
<br>
<br>Islamic Republic will likely increase its influence. If and
<br>when the money dries up, so will the cooperation among these
<br>rented sheikhs. End Comment.
