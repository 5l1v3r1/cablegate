<br>
<br>Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Robert Patterson for reasons
<br>1.4 (b/d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: The return to Russia of historic properties
<br>in Jerusalem and the West Bank, and the end of the visa
<br>regime for travel to Israel, are the latest indicators of
<br>deepening Russia-Israel relations that depend significantly
<br>upon personal contacts as well as official channels. The
<br>properties, which will be used to establish a Russian
<br>consulate in Jerusalem and cultural and religious centers,
<br>will enhance Russia's soft power by increasing the Russian
<br>presence at a time when immigration to Israel has declined.
<br>Russia continues to benefit economically from these emigres,
<br>many of whom have established businesses in Israel that trade
<br>with Russia or have returned to their homeland to work in
<br>Russia's booming economy. The end of the visa regime is
<br>expected to significantly increase personal and economic
<br>contacts between these countries that currently enjoy deep
<br>cultural ties and the strongest political relationship in
<br>their often stormy history. Close ties to Israel do not
<br>appear, however, to have had much impact on Moscow's
<br>"pragmatic" positions on issues of concern to Tel Aviv, such
<br>as arms sales to Syria. End summary.
<br>
<br>Israel and Palestinians Return Russian Property
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Russia will receive several properties in Jerusalem
<br>and the West Bank from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and
<br>Israeli government, which are returning land that Russia
<br>originally acquired in the nineteenth century for the
<br>construction of Orthodox churches and facilities for Russian
<br>pilgrims to the Holy Land. During a June ceremony, the PA
<br>formally gave Russia ownership of three plots of land in the
<br>West Bank that will be the site of new Russian cultural and
<br>religious centers. Russian and Israeli officials announced
<br>in May that they were close to finalizing the terms for
<br>Russia to take ownership of a large compound in Jerusalem
<br>that includes St. Sergiev Church and an adjacent building
<br>originally used as a religious mission. As one of his last
<br>acts as President, Putin ordered that the GOR provide $4
<br>million to restore the church.
<br>
<br>Return to the Holy Land Symbolizes Russian Revival
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) xxxxx
<br>told us that the return of historically Russian property in
<br>the Holy Land was a symbol of Russia's post-Soviet cultural
<br>and religious renaissance. The properties, which had either
<br>been abandoned by the USSR or sold to Israel, would be used
<br>for facilities for religious pilgrims and tourists, as well
<br>as Russian language schools and clinics that would benefit
<br>local residents, including the large number of
<br>Russian-speaking Israelis. The MFA was also considering
<br>establishing a consulate at the compound in Jerusalem.
<br>xxxxx said that at present Russia had only its Embassy in
<br>Tel Aviv and a small Mission in Ramallah to handle relations
<br>with the PA. A presence in Jerusalem would help provide
<br>assistance to the many Russian citizens living in Israel as
<br>well as Russian tourists, whose numbers, presently estimated
<br>at 200,000 per year, were expected to grow significantly
<br>after the Russian-Israeli agreement to end visa requirements
<br>became operative in September.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) xxxxx explained that countries in the region
<br>recognized that providing land to Russia was a means to
<br>improve bilateral relations and attract Russian tourists. In
<br>addition to Israel and the PA, Jordan had already given
<br>Russia land on the banks of the Jordan River historically
<br>associated with Jesus' baptism (ref A). Lebanon also had
<br>property that once belonged to Russia, although discussion of
<br>its return had not begun.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C)xxxxx that GOR
<br>interest in the Holy Land property was part of the Russian
<br>desire to "return" to the Middle East in various ways:
<br>politically by resurrecting ties with Arab states that had
<br>been allowed to atrophy during the 1990s, diplomatically by
<br>enhancing its role in the Middle East Peace Process, and
<br>culturally by re-establishing a physical presence for the
<br>Russian State and Church. For Russians, it was only fitting
<br>that the Orthodox Church should have a presence in Jerusalem
<br>along with the other ancient Christian dominations already
<br>present: the Roman Catholics and Greek Orthodox. xxxxx
<br>said that the PA hoped that giving Russia land for cultural
<br>and religious facilities would attract Russian tourists to
<br>the West Bank.

<br>
<br>Working for the "Glory of Russia"
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) xxxxx explained that while the GOR would formally
<br>own the properties in Israel and the West Bank, the
<br>non-governmental Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society (IOPS)
<br>would run the cultural and religious facilities. Although
<br>the GOR referred to the IOPS, founded in 1872, as "one of the
<br>oldest" Russian NGOs, the organization is not independent of
<br>the government. The head of Russia's Audit Chamber, Sergey
<br>Stepashin, is Chairman of the IOPS and MFA Middle East
<br>Department Deputy Director Oleg Ozerov heads its
<br>international section. The MFA and IOPS signed a memorandum
<br>of cooperation in June to facilitate GOR assistance to the
<br>organization's efforts to develop Russia's "humanitarian,
<br>scientific and cultural relations" with states in the Middle
<br>East. During a June address, FM Lavrov highlighted IOPS'
<br>role in "peoples' diplomacy" that supplemented official
<br>political contacts. He praised IOPS for helping Russia's
<br>spiritual revival and demonstrating that the country was an
<br>"influential and respected power." Lavrov closed, "In order
<br>to worthily return to the Holy Land, we must work...to the
<br>glory of Russia!"
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) IOPS will depend financially upon Russian oligarchs,
<br>including Roman Abramovich and Israeli resident Arkadiy
<br>Gaidamak, both of whom reportedly agreed to the GOR request
<br>that they pay expenses related to acquiring the compound in
<br>Jerusalem.
<br>
<br>Russian Emigres: A "Bridge" Between Russia and Israel
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxx said that the immigration of Russian Jews to
<br>Israel created a bond between the two countries that had a
<br>profound impact on Russia-Israel relations. This did not
<br>mean that those who fled Soviet anti-Semitism had pressured
<br>their new homeland for closer ties with the country that had
<br>repressed them. Instead they created in Israel a center of
<br>Russian culture and formed a "bridge" between the countries.
<br>xxxxx said that many
<br>Russian-speakers in Israel maintained strong ties to their
<br>homeland and some had even returned. The Israeli Embassy
<br>estimated that "tens of thousands" of Israel's
<br>Russian-speakers currently live and work in Moscow. xxxxx
<br>said that he personally knew many Russian-speaking Israelis
<br>who came to participate in Russia's economic boom. With
<br>their knowledge of Russian language and culture, plus
<br>university degrees and business experience gained in Israel,
<br>Europe or the U.S., they could easily find opportunities here.
<br>
<br>Emigres Create "Warm Feelings" for Israel
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C)xxxxx, differentiated the Jews who fled Soviet oppression
<br>and anti-Semitism in the 1970s and 1980s from those who left
<br>in the 1990s to avoid the chaos and uncertainty of
<br>post-Soviet Russia. The latter group did not leave as
<br>"ideological enemies" and maintained positive feelings for
<br>their homeland. Thanks to cable television and the Internet,
<br>they have been able to maintain contact with Russia. While
<br>this has been the experience of Russian immigrants who landed
<br>in different countries, xxxxx said it was especially
<br>acute in Israel where Russian-speakers were one-seventh of
<br>the population. This played well within Russia, where a
<br>Russian cultural foothold in the Middle East generated "warm
<br>feelings toward Israel." During Israel's 2006 war with
<br>Lebanon, Russian television showed Russian-speaking Israeli
<br>soldiers, which helped heighten Russian sympathy for Israel's
<br>situation. xxxxx cited public opinion polls that
<br>showed Russians were more inclined to have a favorable
<br>opinion of Israel than the U.S.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) xxxxx said that immigrants to Israel and
<br>elsewhere extended Russia's cultural reach, which the GOR
<br>recognized as a means to project at least the perception of
<br>influence. For example, the World Congress of Russian Jewry,
<br>an organization that represents Russian Jews in 35 countries
<br>and receives government support, met in May in Jerusalem
<br>where Russian Federation Council member Boris Shpigle said
<br>that Russian Jews must cultivate a special relationship with
<br>their homeland. xxxxx stressed that with the exception
<br>of Ukraine and the Baltic, where Russia had serious political
<br>concerns, the GOR saw its compatriots abroad not as a "fifth
<br>column" but as a bridge between their homeland and adopted
<br>countries. In Israel, a country of which some of Russia's
<br>biggest oligarchs were citizens, the GOR hoped this would
<br>provide opportunities for investment and give Russia access
<br>to Israeli technology. Israeli investment might also come to
<br>
<br>Moscow 00001991 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>Russia, as it did in the case of Lev Levayev, whose
<br>development company is reportedly undertaking large-scale
<br>projects in Moscow and will expand its existing jewelry
<br>factory in Perm. xxxxx thought Russia-Israel trade,
<br>which is estimated at $2.3 billion in 2006, could be several
<br>times higher.
<br>
<br>Immigration to Israel is "Dead"
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) While Russia continues to benefit from the presence
<br>of its existing emigres in Israel, Russian immigration to
<br>Israel is "all but dead" according to Leonard Terlitskiy, the
<br>Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society's representative in the CIS.
<br>Terlitskiy, who was among the first Jews to leave the USSR
<br>during the Brezhnev era, told us that "anyone who wanted to
<br>leave has already left." The Russian economy offered enough
<br>opportunities and anti-Semitism is not the problem it once
<br>was, allowing Jews to remain where they face less chance of
<br>becoming a victim of terrorism than they would in Israel.
<br>Russian daily Vremya Novestey reported that in 2007, only
<br>6,700 people immigrated from the CIS to Israel, compared to
<br>34,000 in 2001. Meanwhile, 38,000 Israeli nationals were
<br>known to have returned recently to live in Russia and the CIS.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) xxxxx thought that the prospect of visa-free travel
<br>to Israel would allow Russian Jews to visit Israel and
<br>develop an affinity for the country and their compatriots
<br>there without the need to emigrate. Members of Moscow's
<br>Jewish community recently told Vremya Novestey that they saw
<br>no need to emigrate and could always visit Israel on a
<br>holiday.
<br>
<br>Russia Maintains "Pragmatic" Policies
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Observers noted that despite the increasing cultural
<br>proximity of Russia and Israel, the GOR maintained its
<br>"pragmatic" stance on weapons sales to Syria and contacts
<br>with Hamas, despite Israeli opposition. This stemmed from
<br>Moscow's ability to compartmentalize aspects of a foreign
<br>policy that fostered relations with Israel and Syria
<br>simultaneously. xxxxx joked that perhaps Israel had evened
<br>the score through military sales to Georgia, including
<br>unmanned aerial drones, the shooting down of which recently
<br>contributed to increasing tensions between Moscow and Tbilisi
<br>(ref B). xxxxx and Israeli Emboffs told us separately that
<br>military sales to Georgia were not an irritant in
<br>Russia-Israel relations, although the GOR had asked Israel
<br>not to sell offensive weapons systems to Tbilisi.
