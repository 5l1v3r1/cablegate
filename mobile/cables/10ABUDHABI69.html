<br>SUBJECT: UAE - SCENESETTER FOR VISIT OF CJCS 
<br> 
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Richard Olson, Ambasador; REASON: 1.4(A), (B), (C), 
<br>(D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (SBU) Admiral Mullen:  we warmly welcome your visit to Abu 
<br>Dhabi, and have requested an appointment with Abu Dhabi Crown 
<br>Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces Shaykh 
<br>Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan (MbZ), whom you last met on 9 
<br>September 2009 in Washington.  We have also requested a meeting 
<br>with your counterpart, Lieutenant General Hamad al-Thani 
<br>al-Romaithi, Chief of Staff of the UAE Armed Forces, whom you last 
<br>met on 8 October 2009 in Washington. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>The Relationship 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) The UAE is one of our closest partners in the Middle 
<br>East and one of our most useful friends worldwide. 
<br> 
<br>-- Al-Dhafra Air Force Base is the high altitude ISR hub for the 
<br>AOR, and supports 50 percent of aerial refueling in the AOR. 
<br> 
<br>-- Ports in Dubai and Fujairah are the logistics backbone for the 
<br>U.S. Fifth.  Jebel Ali (Dubai) is the most frequented USN liberty 
<br>port after Norfolk. 
<br> 
<br>-- Minhad Air Base is a critical hub for Coalition/ISAF partners in 
<br>Afghanistan, including the Australians, Dutch, Canadians, Brits and 
<br>Kiwis. 
<br> 
<br>-- The UAE is a cash customer with FMS sales in excess of $11 
<br>billion.  Commercial sales have an equivalent value.  An additional 
<br>$12 billion of FMS cases are in development with approximately the 
<br>same volume of commercial sales in the works. 
<br> 
<br>-- The UAE recently purchased nine Patriot batteries, and expects 
<br>to move forward on the purchase of THAAD as the first non US 
<br>customer. 
<br> 
<br>-- The UAE currently commands CJTF-152 (Arabian Gulf) and maintains 
<br>an active exercise schedule with U.S. (Red Flag) and other 
<br>multi-lateral partners. 
<br> 
<br>-- The UAE recently hosted an AFCENT survey team to consider U.S. 
<br>access to Liwa (Safran) Air Base in support of contingency 
<br>operations. 
<br> 
<br>-- Additionally, the UAE is considering hosting the Regional 
<br>Integrated Air and Missile Defense Center of Excellence. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>Iran - the Primordial Concern 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) The UAE leadership sees Iran as its primary external 
<br>threat, and one that is existential in nature.  Like much of the 
<br>international community, the UAE finds the idea of an Iran with 
<br>nuclear weapons unacceptable and thinks this eventuality would lead 
<br>to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.  At least as worrying to 
<br>MbZ are Iran's aspirations for regional hegemony by support for 
<br>terrorist proxies (Hizballah, HAMAS, possibly underground 
<br>organizations in the Arab Gulf countries).  MbZ is skeptical that 
<br>Iran can be convinced to end its nuclear weapons program, and is 
<br>not convinced that the international community will adopt tough 
<br>sanctions.  In other words, he sees the logic of war dominating the 
<br>region, and this thinking explains his near obsessive efforts to 
<br>build up the UAE's armed forces. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S/NF) MbZ's main message to us during his September visit was 
<br>that we needed to be better coordinated for Iran contingencies. 
<br>High level engagement by CENTCOM planners have helped to address 
<br>this concern, but he believes we have made less progress in 
<br>addressing what he sees as the slow pace of deliveries of US 
<br> 
<br>security assistance and he is still worried that he does not have 
<br>enough equipment in place to defend his people when war with Iran 
<br>breaks out.  (And for MbZ it is a matter of when, not if.)  We have 
<br>repeatedly presented to his staff the various explanations for what 
<br>he perceives as delays, but he remains unconvinced that we are 
<br>addressing his concerns as a matter of priority. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>

<br> 
<br>Afghanistan - Pakistan:  A Solid Partner 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) Afghanistan:  UAE SOF has been quietly deployed as part of 
<br>OEF since 2003, and the UAE surged its contribution in 2009 adding 
<br>a combined arms task force.  The UAE's UAV capability has been a 
<br>much appreciated force multiplier.  On the economic development 
<br>side, the UAE has pledged about $300 M in assistance, and quietly 
<br>supported the Afghan Reintegration Fund at the recent London 
<br>Conference.  You should thank MbZ for his leadership in being the 
<br>first Arab country to send troops to Afghanistan. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Pakistan:  the UAE has taken a leading role in the Friends 
<br>of Pakistan initiative and has provided about $800 M in assistance 
<br>in recent years.  The Al Nahyan family had a long-standing 
<br>relationship with former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and this 
<br>has transitioned to support for her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, but 
<br>the UAE stays in touch with all elements on the Pakistani scene, 
<br>including Musharraf.  MbZ will be very interested in your dialogue 
<br>with General Kayani. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S/NF) Threat finance:  we have a cooperative relationship with 
<br>the UAE at the Federal level on addressing Taliban financing.  As 
<br>our information has begun to flow, we have seen increasing activity 
<br>and interest on the part of UAE authorities.  That said, the 
<br>subject is delicate and operational aspects are best handled 
<br>through our well established Treasury/Intelligence channel. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>Yemen:  Increasing Concern 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) MbZ shares our concern about Yemen, and if anything, is 
<br>more alarmed about the possibility for destabilization of Saudi 
<br>Arabia.  He is convinced that the Iranians are involved in Yemen, 
<br>and supporting the Houthi rebels.  When we tell him that we have no 
<br>evidence of Iranian support, he is somewhat incredulous, suggesting 
<br>that our focus on Al Qaeda has caused us to lose sight of the 
<br>bigger picture of Iranian adventurism.  You should encourage him to 
<br>provide any specific information on Iranian activities to us 
<br>through intelligence channels. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>Iraq:  the Bellwether for Iran 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S) Iraq:  the UAE was the first GCC Country to cancel Saddam 
<br>era debt and re-establish an embassy, and has generally followed a 
<br>policy of constructive engagement with the Maliki Government.  But 
<br>MbZ runs hot and cold on Iraq.  Sometimes he chooses to emphasize 
<br>his supportive position; at other times he suggests that Iran has 
<br>been the big winner in Iraq, and that Southern Iraq will be one of 
<br>the major flashpoints in the upcoming confrontation with Iran. 
<br>Anything you can say to reassure him about the US commitment to 
<br> 
<br>Iraqi stability will be helpful.
