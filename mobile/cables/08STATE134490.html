<br>REGARDING 2003 ARMENIAN ARMS PROCUREMENT FOR IRAN

<br>REFS: A. YEREVAN 657, B. State 97802 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: EUR/FO DAS Garber, Reasons 1.4 (b), 
<br>(c), and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (U) Please deliver the following letter from Deputy Secretary 
<br>Negroponte.  There will be no signed original.  Embassy should also 
<br>propose discussions with the Government of Armenia in coming weeks. 
<br>Suggested dates and team composition will be provided septel. 
<br>Embassy Yerevan is requested to report response. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (Secret/Rel Armenia) Begin Letter: 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Dear Mr. President: 
<br> 
<br>        We value our positive relationship with your government, 
<br>as we explore a range of shared interests, especially an agreement 
<br>on Nagorno Karabakh and normalization of Armenia's relations with 
<br>Turkey.  At the same time, we are dismayed by a serious  and, 
<br>indeed, deadly - arms re-export case. 
<br> 
<br>        Secretary Rice, Assistant Secretary Fried, Deputy Assistant 
<br>Secretary Bryza, and Ambassador Yovanovitch have raised with you our 
<br>deep concerns about Armenia's transfer of arms to Iran which 
<br>resulted in the death and injury of U.S. soldiers in Iraq. 
<br>Notwithstanding the close relationship between our countries, 
<br>neither the Administration nor the U.S. Congress can overlook this 
<br>case.  By law, the transfer of these weapons requires us to consider 
<br>whether there is a basis for the imposition of U.S. sanctions.  If 
<br>sanctions are imposed, penalties could include the cutoff of U.S. 
<br>assistance and certain export restrictions. 
<br> 
<br>        To avoid such sanctions, it is essential that you present 
<br>compelling evidence that your government is now in partnership with 
<br>us to ensure such transfers do not occur in the future. 
<br> 
<br>        To convince the United States that this will not happen again, 
<br>we seek a written agreement from Armenia, memorializing its intent 
<br>to implement measures that will prevent Armenia from becoming a 
<br>source of weapons for Iran or other states or groups involved with 
<br>terrorism and/or weapons proliferation.  Such measures include: 
<br> 
<br>-- Reform the Armenian Export Control Commission so its members are 
<br>full time employees who exclusively work on export controls; 
<br> 
<br>-- Establish, at each point of entry into Armenia, Armenian teams 
<br>dedicated to detecting and interdicting dual-use commodities and 
<br>other contraband; 
<br> 
<br>-- Periodically accept unannounced visits by U.S. experts to assess 
<br>the work of the teams; 
<br> 
<br>-- Harmonize Armenia's export control legislation with that of the 
<br>EU; 
<br> 
<br>-- Update and make public Armenian export control lists, 
<br>incorporating the control lists of the Wassenaar Arrangement, 
<br>Missile Technology Control Regime, and other international control 
<br>regimes; 
<br> 
<br>-- Ensure that Armenian-based brokers do not facilitate arms related 
<br>transfers; and 
<br> 
<br>-- Consult with the United States on transfers to countries that are 
<br>not member states of NATO or the EU, or participating states of the 
<br>Wassenaar Arrangement. 
<br> 
<br>        We are prepared to send a team as early as possible in the New 
<br>Year to discuss this proposal further.  It is my hope that we can 
<br>work together to forge a positive outcome which provides your 
<br>government the opportunity to strengthen Armenia's export controls 
<br>and for my government to assist you in this effort. 
<br> 
<br>Sincerely, 
<br>John D. Negroponte 
<br> 
<br>End text of letter. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) Background:  In 2003, Armenia facilitated Iran's purchase of 
<br>rockets and machine guns.  In 2007, some of these weapons were 
<br>recovered from two Shia militant attacks in which a United States 
<br>soldier was killed and six others were injured in Iraq.  The 
<br>Secretary discussed our concerns with President Sargsian on the 
<br>margins of the UN General Assembly, but he denied any transfer 
<br>occurred.  The direct role of high-level Armenian officials and the 
<br>link of the weapons to an attack on U.S. forces make this case 
<br>unique and highly troubling.  These transfers may provide a basis 
<br>for sanctions pursuant to U.S. legal authorities.  We propose a 
<br>series of steps that Armenia will need to take to prevent future 
<br>transfers, which will be weighed in the consideration of sanctions. 
<br>We hope to use the threat of sanctions as a tool to generate 
<br>Armenian responsiveness so that we will not be forced to impose 
<br>sanctions measures. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) The Deputy Secretary is writing to President Sargsian and 
<br>indicating that a team will be sent to Armenia to seek written 
<br>agreement that Armenia will take steps to ensure that it does not 
<br>become a source of weapons for Iran or other states or groups of 
<br>concern.  The team will also present additional information that 
<br>will make clear why the United States is convinced that the 
<br>transfers happened and make it unreasonable for Sargsian to continue 
<br>his denials.  We anticipate that the team will travel to Yerevan in 
<br>the coming weeks, to provide sufficient time for the incoming 
<br>Administration to be briefed on the situation. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) Objective:  Our objective is to prevent Armenia from 
<br>becoming a source of weapons for Iran or other states or groups of 
<br>concern, without derailing a possible Nagorno-Karabakh settlement. 
<br>Embassy Yerevan should seek to convey the seriousness with which the 
<br>United States views this issue and emphasize that the transfer of 
<br>arms to Iran and subsequently to terrorists in Iraq, in particular 
<br>transfers that resulted in the death of an American serviceman, 
<br>cannot be overlooked by the United States. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (U) Please contact EUR/PRA Matt Hardiman and ISN/CATR Margaret 
<br>Mitchell with any questions or follow-up issues related to this case 
<br>and slug any reporting on this issue for ISN and EUR.
