<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Among some Kremlin-critics and
<br>establishment figures, speculation has grown over the past
<br>month that Putin and his entourage may be laying the
<br>groundwork for a return to the Kremlin, rather than
<br>safe-guarding the transition of President-elect Medvedev.
<br>While our contacts speculate that Putin has kept his
<br>political options open, some point to his self-conceived
<br>"historic mission" to return Russia to its former glory,
<br>concerns over a rapacious and self-devouring elite, and
<br>distrust of Medvedev's long-term ambitions as fueling recent
<br>maneuvers to further entrench the out-going president's
<br>powers. Acknowledging Medvedev's personal loyalty to Putin,
<br>observers point to competition among staff and rumors over
<br>Mrs. Medvedev's ambitions for her husband. Rumors
<br>notwithstanding, little of this speculation has a factual
<br>underpinning, but it does reflect continual nervousness among
<br>the elite about Putin's intentions and the fate of the
<br>tandemocracy. Putin's intentions and actions have rarely (if
<br>ever) been correctly forecast over the past year by Moscow's
<br>political elite. End Summary
<br>
<br>Putin: Once and Future President?
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Some Moscow politicians and Kremlin watchers are
<br>reading post-electoral and pre-inaugural political maneuvers
<br>(ref a) as signs of the possibility that Putin could return
<br>to the Kremlin, either at the end of Medvedev's term or -- in
<br>the event of underperformance or disloyalty -- before. As
<br>Kremlin opponent xxxxx told the Ambassador, Putin's
<br>continued domination of political life, the focus on his
<br>transition to the White House (rather than on Medvedev's
<br>shift to Putin's Kremlin office), the possible creation of a
<br>Cabinet-like host of Deputy Prime Ministers, and Putin's
<br>decision to take up leadership of the ruling party, has
<br>fueled theories that Putin could be keeping his options open
<br>to return as President. Putin's  xxxxx and
<br>others have stressed, is how to override the political
<br>predisposition that leads Russians to look to the Kremlin
<br>(whether to the Tsar or the General Secretary) for authority.
<br>As president, xxxxx argued, Medvedev's stature will be
<br>enhanced both constitutionally and psychologically.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Acknowledging today's shift in political speculation
<br>away from the hypothesis that Putin would serve a limited
<br>period as Prime Minister in order to safeguard Medvedev's
<br>transition, prominent xxxxx
<br>argued that Putin's decision to lead United Russia was about
<br>protecting his own interests, and not those of Medvedev.
<br>Absent a pre-existing gentleman's agreement with the
<br>President-elect, xxxxx characterized Putin's choreography
<br>of the last several weeks as a "humiliation" of his
<br>successor. xxxxx 
<br>told us that, based on blowback from Kremlin ideological guru
<br>Vladislav Surkov over critical xxxxx articles, it was clear to
<br>him that "Putin wants to be the leading guy." As an example
<br>of Kremlin sensitivities, xxxxx pointed to Surkov's quick
<br>intervention in the wake of an NG article that described
<br>Medvedev's prospective rule as a period of liberal thaw.
<br>Because the term "thaw" connotes Khrushchev's initial reign,
<br>xxxxx noted, it begged the question of "who was Stalin"
<br>and implied that change was needed, rather than the
<br>continuation of Putin's course.
<br>
<br>Putin's Historic Mission, Internecine Clans
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Pointing to Putin's sense of historical mission in
<br>returning Russia to its previous world power status, analysts
<br>tell us that intra-elite divisions remain too poisonous and
<br>the prospect for elite conflict too great for Putin to remove
<br>himself from a power construct that he (and not a system of
<br>checks and balances) polices. xxxxx who also serves on
<br>Medvedev's think tank, questioned why Putin sought
<br>"dictatorial powers" over the party, given his preexisting de
<br>facto command of United Russia. His decision was "alarming,"
<br>xxxxx claimed, because it demonstrated the uncertainty
<br>that exists in Putin's entourage over the political
<br>transition, despite the fact that "all executive powers will
<br>be shared between Putin and Medvedev" and the government
<br>machinery will be "as focused on Putin, if not more."
<br>xxxxx separately suggested that Putin's party leadership
<br>was an additional layer of protection should Medvedev become
<br>too confident with the presidential perquisites and seek to
<br>modify Putin's imprimatur.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) As a long-time advocate of a third presidential term
<br>for Putin, xxxxx editor xxxxx told us
<br>that Putin had been hemmed in by his desire for international
<br>legitimacy, even though amending the Russian constitution to
<br>remove term limits would have been "easy and understandable
<br>in the context of Russia's stage of political development."
<br>xxxxx speculated that the de facto rejiggering of power
<br>between the Kremlin and White House was awkward, but
<br>necessary, given Putin's self-imposed requirement of
<br>respecting the Russian constitution. While xxxxx argued
<br>that the concentration of power was a "temporary phase" in a
<br>"long, very long" evolution to more democratic institutions,
<br>liberal critics like former Duma deputy xxxxx see
<br>the accumulation of power -- with Putin in "de facto and de
<br>jure control over the club of the top administrative and
<br>economic nomenclature" -- as an end in itself. As xxxxx
<br>noted, the flurry of presidential orders shifting Kremlin
<br>staff to White House positions in advance of Putin becoming
<br>Prime Minister on May 8 were an interesting reflection of
<br>Putin's mentality: rather than have "little Dima" sign the
<br>presidential decrees authorizing the transfer of cadre, Putin
<br>continued to dictate the terms of his premier-ship, revealing
<br>how lopsided this partnership will be at the outset.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Amidst the political uncertainty, the idea of Russia
<br>evolving into a parliamentary republic is batted around, but
<br>mostly batted down. While both xxxxx and RAO UES and SPS
<br>opposition party deputy xxxxx were at a loss to
<br>explain Putin's decision to head United Russia absent a
<br>strategy based on constitutionally reconfiguring Russia's
<br>political system, each conceded Putin's public opposition to
<br>the idea. Given Putin's domination of politics since
<br>Medvedev's March 2 electoral win, many viewed his comments at
<br>the one-year memorial of former President Yeltsin's death,
<br>that the presidency would "continue to serve the Russian
<br>people and protect (Russia's) sovereign interests," as
<br>significant. xxxxx confirmed to us that during the course
<br>of his xxxxx with Medvedev,
<br>the President-elect was insistent that Russia required a
<br>presidential system and dismissive of public speculation over
<br>the "tandem."
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) xxxxx while discounting the role of opposition
<br>parties at present, warned against GOR policies that created
<br>competition between bureaucrats rather than parties. While
<br>Russia was not a democracy, xxxxx maintained that it was
<br>on a path that could lead to democracy, but only if more
<br>pluralism was built into the system. The problem with the
<br>ruling party's self-conscious imitation of Japan's Liberal
<br>Democratic Party, with its creation of "clubs," he stressed,
<br>was that United Russia lacked intra-party ideological
<br>coherence and competition. At the end of the day, it would
<br>not matter what liberal United Russia Duma deputy Pligin
<br>thought, but rather how the Kremlin told him to vote that
<br>would determine the outcome of any Duma contest. The
<br>challenge for Medvedev, xxxxx posited, will be to
<br>reintroduce faith in the system among middle class voters,
<br>who stayed home or spoiled their ballot, that their voice
<br>matters. It is that portion of the electorate, xxxxx
<br>stressed, that the government will need to rely upon for
<br>support for economic modernization.
<br>
<br>Staff and Spousal Ambitions
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The maneuvering begs the question of what Putin and
<br>his entourage could possibly fear in the reflexively loyal
<br>Medvedev. Ekspert magazine speculated that the mere
<br>formation of an economic think-tank (ref b) by the
<br>President-elect had been enough to raise concerns of a rival
<br>team and vision. When asked, xxxxx did not dispute the
<br>analysis, acknowledging that between the outgoing and
<br>incoming presidents' staff there were elements of
<br>competition. Even on minor issues, such as extending press
<br>invitations for the inauguration, xxxxx said that
<br>confusion over lines of authority had led to delay. United
<br>Russia Duma deputy and Kremlin spin-doctor Sergey Markov
<br>admitted to us that the transition had produced legislative
<br>and political paralysis, with everyone "waiting for
<br>directions" on how to work with the tandem.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The role of Medvedev's wife, Svetlana, in generating
<br>tensions between the camps remains the subject of avid
<br>gossip. xxxxx hinting at Svetlana's reputation for
<br>aggressive social climbing, xxxxx was less discrete, calling her a "stupid and
<br>ambitious" woman, who purportedly had already drawn up a list
<br>of officials who should "suffer" for their betrayal of
<br>

<br>ascendant.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In the absence of facts, speculation is driving
<br>Moscow political currents. While it will be months before we
<br>get a better sense of the division of labor between Medvedev
<br>and Putin, the sense here is that the pre-inaugural
<br>atmospherics have diminished, rather than buttressed
<br>Medvedev's political stature and fueled nervousness among
<br>Moscow's hyper-sensitive political elite as to whether the
<br>succession question has been definitively resolved. Putin
<br>has been master of the political surprise over the past year
<br>and consistently bamboozled the chattering class and pundits
<br>as to his long-term intentions.
