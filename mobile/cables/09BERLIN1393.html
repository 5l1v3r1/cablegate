<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Germany's new federal interior minister, 
<br>Thomas de Maiziere, is known for being a competent 
<br>administrator who performed effectively over the past four 
<br>years as the Chancellery Chief of Staff.  De Maiziere is a 
<br>close confidant of Chancellor Merkel, their professional 
<br>relationship dates back to 1990, and he developed a 
<br>reputation as a reliable crisis manager and interagency 
<br>master over the past four years.  Although de Maiziere 
<br>previously served as a state interior minister in Saxony, he 
<br>has less direct experience dealing with the international 
<br>security issues - most prominently counterterrorism - that he 
<br>will face as federal interior minister.  Furthermore, de 
<br>Maiziere is not known for being ideological or outspoken.  In 
<br>this respect, de Maiziere represents a marked change from his 
<br>predecessor, powerhouse Wolfgang Schaeuble, who had strong 
<br>views on security policy and was willing to endure 
<br>considerable criticism to achieve his policy goals.  We do 
<br>not expect de Maiziere to push for further expanding law 
<br>enforcement powers of police and/or security services.  De 
<br>Maiziere indicates that he intends to focus on integration of 
<br>foreigners into German society and will continue the 
<br>Ministry's Islam Conference, a controversial Schaeuble 
<br>initiative that had advanced the country's discussion on 
<br>immigration and discrimination issues.  He also intends to 
<br>promote the further integration of former east and west 
<br>Germany.  END SUMMARY 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>An Aristocratic Westerner Makes His Name in the East 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (U) De Maiziere, 55, is a lawyer by training who was born 
<br>and raised in Bonn, but has spent nearly the last two decades 
<br>in the eastern states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony. 
<br>He is a descendent of the noble Maiziere-les-Metz family who, 
<br>as Huguenots, fled France for asylum in Prussia in the late 
<br>seventeenth century.  De Maiziere's father, Ulrich, was 
<br>Inspector General of the German Armed Forces.  His cousin, 
<br>Lothar, was the last, and only democratically elected, 
<br>Premier of the German Democratic Republic, who later served 
<br>as a minister in the Kohl government.  As a staffer in the 
<br>offices of Berlin Governing Mayor Richard von Weizsacker, and 
<br>later Eberhard Diepgen, de Maiziere participated in the 
<br>negotiations on German reunification.  After 1990, de 
<br>Maiziere worked to re-establish democratic structures in 
<br>eastern states starting first in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. 
<br>From 1998 through 2005, de Maiziere served in Saxony as head 
<br>of the State Chancery, and as Finance, Justice and Interior 
<br>Minister.  De Maiziere joined the Christian Democratic Union 
<br>(CDU) as a student in 1972.  De Maiziere won a direct mandate 
<br>in the September 27 national parliamentary election and is 
<br>now a member of the Bundestag representing the district of 
<br>Meissen in Saxony. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) De Maiziere first met Angela Merkel in 1990 and his 
<br>recommendation of her to his cousin Lothar de Maiziere is 
<br>said to have facilitated her entry into CDU politics. 
<br>Chancellor Merkel and de Maiziere are known to have a very 
<br>close professional relationship and to share a similar sober 
<br>and analytical approach to governing.  De Maiziere is 
<br>reported to have performed well throughout his tenure as 
<br>Merkel's Chancellery Chief and Minister for Special Duties. 
<br>As Chancellery Chief of Staff, de Maiziere was known as a 
<br>consensus builder who understands and effectively works the 
<br> 
<br>interagency process, sometimes requiring competing ministers 
<br>to resolve disputes among themselves.  The Chancellor no 
<br>doubt appreciated de Maiziere's efforts to shield her from 
<br>these policy battles given her general propensity to stay 
<br>above the fray and to express an opinion on an issue only 
<br>when consensus has been reached at the cabinet level. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>De Maiziere Faces a Steep Learning Curve 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) De Maiziere's experience in eastern Germany helped him 
<br>gain new responsibilities for the Federal Interior Ministry: 
<br>the entire Department of Eastern German affairs has been 
<br>moved from the Transportation and Urban Affairs Ministry to 
<br>the Interior Ministry.  In his remarks to ministry employees 
<br>on his first day in office, de Maiziere said that with this 
<br>move the interior ministry is now responsible for not only 
<br>immigrant integration, but also the integration of Eastern 
<br>and Western Germany and the cohesion of German society.  De 
<br>Maiziere will continue the German Islam Conference, an 
<br>initiative started by his predecessor, which seeks to improve 
<br>the integration of Germany's Muslim population and open a 
<br>dialogue between the government and Germany's Muslim 
<br>community.  The Islam Conference has met with some 
<br>controversy and came under scrutiny earlier this year when it 
<br>was discovered that some Muslim representatives were alleged 
<br>to have links with extremist groups. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) De Maiziere has some familiarity with security 
<br>issues given that his duties in the Chancellery included 
<br>overall coordination of Germany's intelligence services.  De 
<br>Maiziere was helpful in promoting cooperation between German 
<br>ministries and security services with USG counterparts both 
<br>during the 2007 Sauerland Islamic Jihad Union terrorist cell 
<br>case and following extremist threats surrounding the recent 
<br>national elections.  De Maiziere's predecessor Wolfgang 
<br>Schaeuble spent considerable time dealing with the issue of 
<br>terrorism and working to update Germany's legal frameworks 
<br>and expand the mandates of law enforcement agencies to ensure 
<br>they had the capabilities to address the phenomena.  In 
<br>contrast, de Maiziere said virtually nothing in public on the 
<br>issue of terrorism during his time in the Chancellery, and he 
<br>has not emphasized the topic since moving to Interior. 
<br>Therefore, there is some question concerning the depth of his 
<br>knowledge of the transnational character of terrorism, 
<br>radicalization pathways, and terrorists' increasing use of 
<br>the Internet and related technology to recruit, train and 
<br>organize, aspects of the issue that most affect Germany today. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) During his first day remarks to employees, de Maiziere 
<br>made the peculiar statement that "the Interior Ministry is 
<br>responsible for internal matters, and the Foreign Ministry is 
<br>responsible for issues external to Germany."  This 
<br>characterization of the MoI's tasks contrasts sharply with EU 
<br>law enforcement integration initiatives under Schaeuble such 
<br>as the Pruem data sharing agreement.  Observers are concerned 
<br>that de Maiziere's limited perspective could result in 
<br>diminished bilateral cooperation and mark a significant 
<br>departure from former minister Schaeuble, who placed a heavy 
<br>emphasis throughout his tenure on increasing security 
<br>cooperation with European and other international partners. 
<br>De Maiziere would benefit from learning about the benefits of 
<br>international cooperation first hand from his counterparts at 
<br>the G6 meeting in London this week, which DHS Secretary 
<br>Napolitano and senior DoJ representatives will attend. 
<br>(Note: The G6 is an informal grouping of the interior 
<br>ministers of Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Poland and the 
<br>UK.  Schaeuble made a point of inviting the USG to G6 
<br>meetings that he hosted, a custom that UK Minister Jacqui 
<br>Smith is following for this week's London meeting.  Ref D.) 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Will de Maiziere be a Strong Security Partner? 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) We do not expect de Maiziere to be aggressive in 
<br>pushing for expanded security powers.  However, there is less 
<br>need for this as two recent legislative packages have already 
<br>strengthened Germany's counterterrorism legal framework (Refs 
<br>C and E).  More relevant is whether de Maiziere will build on 
<br>Schaeuble's record of deepening U.S.-German security 
<br>cooperation, such as the successful negotiations of a 
<br>bilateral "Pruem-like" agreement to exchange information on 
<br>terrorism and serious crime suspects, as well as establish an 
<br>automated fingerprint checking system.  Final implementation 
<br>of our agreement is awaiting resolution of some concerns 
<br>raised by a Green Party Justice Senator from Hamburg.  We 
<br>will likely need support from de Maiziere to break this 
<br>impasse, but it is unclear whether de Maiziere is willing to 
<br>make the effort on an initiative that his predecessor 
<br>initiated and for which he received heavy criticism due to 
<br>data privacy concerns.  On the issue of resettlement of 
<br>Guantanamo detainees, de Maiziere has yet to express a 
<br>viewpoint one way or the other. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) We anticipate that data protection and domestic 
<br>security issues will be a continuing theme that the new 
<br>coalition government of the Christian Democrats (CDU and CSU) 
<br>and Free Democrats (FDP) will struggle with.  During the 
<br>previous administration, the FDP regularly criticized former 
<br>interior minister Schaeuble for policies which the FDP 
<br>believed trampled on citizens' privacy rights (Ref B). 
<br>Germany's new Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
<br>(FDP) believes that Schaeuble went too far in giving police 
<br>new powers of investigation, and she was successful in 
<br>committing the new government to modify a number of these 
<br>powers and introducing added data protection measures in the 
<br>recently completed coalition agreement (Ref A).  The FDP has 
<br>found it politically expedient to cast personal freedoms and 
<br>security policy as mutually exclusive.  In this debate, de 
<br>Maiziere's greatest advantage is that he is not Schaeuble. 
<br>As Interior Minister, de Maiziere is expected to support 
<br>existing laws and practices initiated by his predecessor, and 
<br>his reputation for reasonableness and consensus-building 
<br>should serve him well in these discussions.
