<br>SUBJECT: CHANCELLOR MERKEL ANGERED BY LACK OF GERMAN MEP
<br>SUPPORT FOR TFTP
<br>
<br>REF: A. BERLIN 176
<br>¶B. BERLIN 128
<br>
<br>Classified By: ROBERT A. POLLARD, Minister-Counselor for Economics Affa
<br>irs, for Reasons 1.4 (b and d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Chancellor Merkel is privately angry over the
<br>lack of support German members of the European Parliament
<br>gave the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) interim
<br>agreement and is worried that Washington will view the EP's
<br>veto as a sign that Europe does not take the terrorist threat
<br>seriously.  Merkel is particularly irritated with German MEPs
<br>from her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and sister
<br>Christian Social Union (CSU) parties, most of whom reportedly
<br>voted against the agreement despite previously indicating
<br>they would support it.  Public German reactions to the EP
<br>vote have come exclusively from TFTP detractors who portrayed
<br>the veto as a sign that the European Parliament has won a
<br>victory over an arrogant Commission/Council, as well as
<br>delivering a rebuke to U.S. counterterrorism policies that
<br>undervalue data privacy.  These events suggest the need to
<br>intensify our engagement with German government
<br>interlocutors, Bundestag and European parliamentarians, and
<br>opinion makers to demonstrate that the U.S. has strong data
<br>privacy measures in place.  END SUMMARY
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Hamburg Mayor Ole von Beust (CDU) told Ambassador
<br>today (2/12) that he had met with Chancellor Merkel last
<br>night and she was "very, very angry - angrier than he had
<br>ever seen her" with the outcome of the vote.  Beust said that
<br>the Chancellor had personally lobbied German MEPs from the
<br>CDU/CSU parties to support the agreement, but that most of
<br>these MEPs ended up voting against the agreement anyway.
<br>Merkel expressed concerns to Beust that Washington will view
<br>the EP veto as a sign that Europe does not take the terrorist
<br>threat seriously.  Merkel also worried about the
<br>ramifications (presumably within Europe and for transatlantic
<br>relations) that might follow were a terrorist attack to occur
<br>that could have been prevented had SWIFT data been exchanged.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Federal Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger,
<br>a strong proponent of data privacy rights from the Free
<br>Democratic Party (FDP; see reftels), quickly welcomed the
<br>TFTP veto.  She said "the citizens of Europe have won a
<br>victory today that strengthened not just data protection, but
<br>democracy in all of Europe."  The Minister has been a vocal
<br>critic of the TFTP and in interviews today stressed that the
<br>EP veto will lead to a change of European policy in which
<br>"data protection is no longer just an appendix of security
<br>policy."  She also restated her understanding that German
<br>investigators believe TFTP data has not/not contributed
<br>meaningfully to terrorism investigations.  She said the EP
<br>decision paves the way for new negotiations that take into
<br>account European notions of data protection.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Some German members of the European Parliament
<br>likewise applauded the TFTP veto.  Green Party MEP Jan
<br>Philipp Albrecht stated that the vote would not cause a
<br>"transatlantic ice-age" because President Obama has more
<br>important concerns and would not "emphasize this defeat too
<br>much at home."  Werner Langen, head of the EP CDU/CSU group,
<br>said that his group did not vote against the United States,
<br>but rather against the European Commission and the Council
<br>who had "negotiated a bad agreement."  Martin Schulz, head of
<br>the Social Democratic faction, said that the "negotiating
<br>position of the EU is now better."  FDP MEP Alexander Graf
<br>Lambsdorff acknowledged that the decision could be a
<br>temporary irritation in transatlantic relations, but believed
<br>that this would not last long and the time would soon come to
<br>"negotiate a reasonable agreement."  Bavarian State Minister
<br>Mueller told Munich CG that the CSU is interested in moving
<br>forward with the negotiation of a new agreement that meets US
<br>and European needs.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) COMMENT:  Why did so many German MEPs oppose TFTP?
<br>
<br>BERLIN 00000180  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>First, the debate was not just about TFTP.  Germans across
<br>the political spectrum adamantly support data protection )
<br>whether it has to do with Passenger Name Records, Google,s
<br>supposed &monopoly8 on data searches, or individual credit
<br>ratings.  Recent scandals in which major firms such as
<br>Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Bahn illegally tapped phones or
<br>files of tens of thousands of employees and customers
<br>reinforced Germans, concerns about the misuse of data
<br>technology.  Historical memory also plays a part, as stories
<br>about how the Stasi abused information to destroy people,s
<br>lives still regularly circulate in the press.  Paranoia runs
<br>deep especially about U.S. intelligence agencies.  We were
<br>astonished to learn how quickly rumors about alleged U.S.
<br>economic espionage ) at first associated with the new U.S.
<br>air passenger registration system (ESTA), then with TFTP )
<br>gained currency among German parliamentarians in the run-up
<br>to the February 11 vote in Strasbourg.  Moreover, the fact
<br>that the libertarian Free Democratic Party (FDP) made data
<br>privacy a central plank of the pact with its coalition
<br>partners, the CDU/CSU ) and more importantly, captured the
<br>Justice Ministry ) made it very difficult for TFTP advocates
<br>like Interior Minister de Maiziere to speak up.  None of this
<br>may excuse the behavior of certain German MEPs, but it says
<br>something about the challenge ahead.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) COMMENT CONT.: The overwhelming rejection of the
<br>interim agreement by German MEPs from all political parties
<br>nonetheless is surprising.  Although we anticipated that the
<br>FDP and Greens would come out strongly against the interim
<br>agreement, the broad lack of support it received from the
<br>CDU/CSU and Social Democrats was unexpected.  We believe a
<br>number of factors contributed to this including the fact that
<br>MEPs of all stripes saw this as an early opportunity to exert
<br>their new post-Lisbon powers and send a message to the
<br>Commission and Council.  Specific to Germany, the almost
<br>complete absence of public statements by German leadership in
<br>support of the agreement resulted in a situation in which
<br>MEPs received no political coverage supporting a positive
<br>vote and saw little political cost for a no vote.
<br>Furthermore, the German public and political class largely
<br>tends to view terrorism abstractly given that it has been
<br>decades since any successful terrorist attack has occurred on
<br>German soil.  This week's TFTP vote demonstrates that we need
<br>to intensify our engagement with German government
<br>interlocutors, Bundestag and European parliamentarians and
<br>opinion makers to get our views across.  We need to also
<br>demonstrate that the U.S. has strong data privacy measures in
<br>place so that robust data sharing comes with robust data
<br>protections.
