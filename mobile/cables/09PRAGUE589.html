<br>SUBJECT: CZECH COMMENTS ON U.S.-CZECH STRATEGIC COOPERATION 
<br> 
<br>REF: CARNIE-QUANRUD E-MAIL DATED 10.01.2009 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Charge Mary Thompson-Jones for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>(SBU) In response to delivery of USG non-paper on U.S. 
<br>Ballistic Missile Defense in Europe, Czech MFA Political 
<br>Director Ivo Sramek noted that he is pleased that we are 
<br>having an ongoing dialogue and that we are all examining ways 
<br>to advance U.S.-Czech strategic collaboration.  He did not 
<br>have substantive comments on the paper on October 1, although 
<br>he noted that the MFA is collaborating with the MoD to flesh 
<br>out the September 17 paper "Beyond the Missile Defense Review 
<br>- The Way Forward in Strategic Cooperation." Sramek noted 
<br>that this coming paper will add greater detail and 
<br>specificity to the original paper the Czechs handed over.  He 
<br>also noted that he would be discussing it on October 2 with 
<br>FM Kohout and that they hope to be able to provide it to us 
<br>early next week.  He noted that the approach in this coming 
<br>paper is in keeping with the Kohout-S dialogue in New York on 
<br>the UNGA margins, where the Secretary encouraged the Czechs 
<br>to "think broadly" about cooperation and not simply to focus 
<br>on military cooperation. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Following this meeting, MFA Political Director Ivan 
<br>Pocuch told emboff that within the MFA and MoD this paper was 
<br>ready last week to hand over and that it was quite detailed 
<br>and focused on the strategic relationship.  This paper, 
<br>however, was held up by FM Kohout who felt that it was much 
<br>too narrowly focused.  Pocuch and his Deputy, Petr 
<br>Chalupecky, plan to press hard for this paper to be clearly 
<br>prioritized and focused before it is handed over to us.  He 
<br>also stated that from his point of view it is most important 
<br>that we know that the Czechs wish to be involved in a 
<br>substantive way in this new security architecture, however it 
<br>evolves. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (SBU) Separately Defense Attache Wally Scales met with MoD 
<br>Director of Security Policy Ivan Dvorak and delivered this 
<br>paper.  According to Colonel Scales, Dvorak commented on the 
<br>High Level Defense Group meeting to note that the first week 
<br>of November was fine for the Czechs and that they hoped to 
<br>see USG participation at the level of Under Secretary of 
<br>Defense Flournoy.
