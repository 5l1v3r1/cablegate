<br>¶B. TD-314/09169-05 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001914 001.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: A/DCM Kathleen Fitzpatrick; reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The Spanish Supreme Court announced July 24 
<br>that it had annulled the six-year prison sentence handed down 
<br>in September by Spain's National Court against accused 
<br>terrorist Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed, known in the media as the 
<br>"Spanish Taliban." Abderrahaman, a Spanish national captured 
<br>in Afghanistan by U.S. forces and held at Guantanamo until 
<br>being turned over to Spanish authorities in February 2004, 
<br>was immediately released from prison. The Supreme Court 
<br>found that Spanish prosecutors could not use any evidence 
<br>collected during their interview with Abderrahaman while he 
<br>was being held at Guantanamo under conditions the Court 
<br>termed "impossible to explain, much less justify." The Court 
<br>threw out other evidence collected against Abderrahaman prior 
<br>to his capture in Afghanistan and determined that prosecutors 
<br>had skewed Abderrahaman's testimony to incriminate him. This 
<br>finding had an immediate effect on the case of Lahcen 
<br>Ikassrien, a Moroccan national and former Guantanamo detainee 
<br>tranferred to Spanish custody in July 2005. Prosecutors 
<br>announced their recommendation to release Ikassrien on bail 
<br>while awaiting trial on terrorism charges, while 
<br>Abderrahaman's attorney said he would sue the U.S. Government 
<br>for suffering allegedly suffered by Abderrahaman during his 
<br>incarceration in Guantanamo. Spanish officials involved in 
<br>the Abderrahaman case expressed disappointment in his 
<br>release, but also said that he was not particularly dangerous 
<br>and dismissed him as a threat. This ruling does not indicate 
<br>a reduction in counter-terrorism cooperation by Spanish law 
<br>enforcement officials, but the Supreme Court's decisions will 
<br>clearly have to be taken into account as we pursue improved 
<br>judicial cooperation with Spain. The Spanish judicial branch 
<br>carefully guards its hard-won indepence, meaning it will not 
<br>shy away from rulings that cut across Spanish Government (or 
<br>USG) objectives. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>//BACKGROUND// 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) According to sentencing documents, Abderrahaman 
<br>established contacts with al-Qa'ida elements in the Spanish 
<br>enclave of Ceuta and, in August 2001, traveled to Afghanistan 
<br>for religious and military training in Kandahar. When the 
<br>U.S. invaded Afghanistan in the wake of the September 11 
<br>attacks, Abderrahaman fled to Pakistan, where he was 
<br>reportedly captured by the Pakistani military, who turned him 
<br>over to U.S. forces. Abderrahaman was transferred to 
<br>Guantanamo, where he was held until he was turned over to 
<br>Spanish authorities in February 2004 in response to a request 
<br>by magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who wanted to investigate 
<br>Abderrahaman in connection with the trial of al-Qa'ida cell 
<br>leader Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas. Under the terms of that 
<br>transfer, Spanish authorities agreed to: 
<br>
<br>-- Be prepared to detain, investigate, and prosecute 
<br>Abderrahaman, while treating him humanely; 
<br>
<br>-- Share with USG authorities any information developed 
<br>during the investigation; 
<br>
<br>-- Provide reasonable notice of any decision to release or 
<br>transfer Abderrahaman; 
<br>
<br>-- Conduct surveillance of Abderrahaman following his 
<br>release, and share any relevant information with the U.S.; 
<br>and, 
<br>
<br>-- Provide U.S. officials access to Abderrahaman if necessary. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Garzon released Abderrahaman on bail in July 2004, 
<br>finding that Spanish National Police interrogations of 
<br>Abderrahaman while he was being held in Guantanamo could not 
<br>be used as evidence. However, the National Police had 
<br>previous wiretap evidence linking Abderrahaman to Barakat 
<br>Yarkas as well as what they viewed as incriminating 
<br>statements by Abderrahaman to police investigators following 
<br>his release from Guantanamo. In early 2005, a confidential 
<br>police assessment shared with USG officials concluded that 
<br>Abderrahaman had the "mental maturity of a 12-year-old," was 
<br>"naive and foolish," and did not seem to comprehend the 
<br>gravity of his detention in Guantanamo. But the report also 
<br>noted Abderrahaman's consistent statements to Spanish police 
<br>that he wanted to "go fight with the Chechens and kill 
<br>Russians." (REF B). Police provided this information to 
<br>prosecutors and to the National Court, which found 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001914 002.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Abderrahaman guilty in September 2005 of "membership in a 
<br>terrorist organization." The case was then automatically 
<br>transferred to the Supreme Court to either overturn or 
<br>confirm the sentence. 
<br>
<br>//SUPREME COURT THROWS OUT CONVICTION// 
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) The Supreme Court overturned Abderrahaman's conviction 
<br>on the basis that the National Court had allowed prosecutors 
<br>to use inadmissible evidence to establish Abderrahaman's 
<br>guilt and that prosecutors had improperly translated 
<br>Abderrahaman's incriminating testimony. Specifically, the 
<br>Supreme Court found that testimony obtained by Spanish police 
<br>investigators during the course of interviews of Abderrahaman 
<br>in Guantanamo could not be used in court because the 
<br>"interrogations, euphemistically called "interviews," took 
<br>place under unequal circumstances because (the defendant) was 
<br>in detention" at the time of the interrogations. Further, 
<br>the Supreme Court finding stated that "although it is not for 
<br>(this Court) to issue a pronouncement regarding the situation 
<br>of those held in indefinite detention, we must state that, as 
<br>Ahmed was held in detention under the authority of the U.S. 
<br>military since he was turned over (to the U.S.) on an 
<br>undetermined date, all information obtained under such 
<br>conditions must be declared totally null and nonexistent." 
<br>The Court did go on to pronounce its position on Guantanamo, 
<br>criticizing the detention of "hundreds of people, among them 
<br>Ahmed, without charges, without rights, without controls, and 
<br>without limits," a situation the Court termed "impossible to 
<br>explain, much less justify." 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) Just as damaging to the prosecution's case was the 
<br>Court's decision to throw out telephone intercepts 
<br>incriminating Abderrahaman obtained during the course of the 
<br>Barakat Yarkas investigation and long before Abderrahaman's 
<br>detention in Afghanistan. The judges found that the 
<br>intercepts had been obtained improperly (NOTE: the Supreme 
<br>Court had already ruled against allowing the intercepts 
<br>during its review of the convictions of Barakat Yarkas cell 
<br>members). The Supreme Court also determined that prosecutors 
<br>had improperly translated Abderrahaman's statements and had 
<br>omitted exculpatory evidence, such as Abderrahaman's 
<br>declaration that he did not belong to al-Qa'ida and had not 
<br>received military training. The Court criticized prosecutors 
<br>for omitting a document "signed in Guantanamo by Abderrahaman 
<br>before being turned over to Spanish authorities," a document 
<br>in which U.S. authorities allegedly acknowledged that 
<br>Abderrahaman was not a member of al-Qa'ida. On this basis, 
<br>the Supreme Court found that the case against Abderrahaman 
<br>failed to meet the minimum standards established by the 
<br>European Court of Human Rights for a finding of "guilty 
<br>beyond a reasonable doubt." 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Legat contacted Eduardo Fungairino, currently the head 
<br>of an anti-terrorism office assigned to the Supreme Court and 
<br>formerly the chief of the National Prosecutor's office, on 
<br>July 25 for his insights into the Abderrahaman decision. 
<br>Fungairino (strictly protect) dismissed the Supreme Court 
<br>decision as "facile and populist." He said that while he 
<br>acknowledged errors on the part of National Court prosecutors 
<br>in the case (and the legal problems generated by the 
<br>circumstances at Guantanamo), in his view the Supreme Court 
<br>ignored evidence of Abderrahaman's terrorist training in 
<br>Pakistan and Afghanistan, activities that are clearly 
<br>criminal under Spanish law. Fungairino indicated that one 
<br>consolation, in his view, was that Abderrahaman did not 
<br>represent a serious threat, echoing police assessments that 
<br>Abderrahaman was a pawn in events beyond his understanding 
<br>(see para 3). 
<br>
<br>//ABDERRAHAMAN PLANS TO SUE USG// 
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) In a July 25 press conference organized by 
<br>Abderrahaman attorney Marcos Garcia Montes, Abderrahaman told 
<br>reporters that he hoped to gain employment as a truck driver 
<br>and claimed that his vision had degraded so much during his 
<br>detention in Guantanamo that he was unfit for other 
<br>employment. Garcia Montes said that he planned to file a 
<br>"multimillion dollar suit" against the U.S. Government for 
<br>damages, including post-traumatic stress and vision loss on 
<br>the part of his client. The attorney told reporters that 
<br>Abderrahaman's suffering had been such that he could no 
<br>longer recall specific elements of his detention in 
<br>Guantanamo, nor of his time in Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
<br>Abderrahaman roundly denied ever having been a terrorist and 
<br>insisted that his prior references to himself as a "martyr" 
<br>referred to his treatment in detention. Prompted by his 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001914 003.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>attorney, Abderrahaman related his alleged mistreatment in 
<br>U.S. detention, including the presence of a powerful 
<br>lightbulb in his cell that impeded sleep and threats that he 
<br>would never see his family again. Abderrahaman said he 
<br>planned to write a book about his experiences. 
<br>//IKASSRIEN ALSO TO BE RELEASED// 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Following the Supreme Court decision in the 
<br>Abderrahaman case, National Court prosecutors announced that 
<br>they would support the release on bail of Moroccan national 
<br>Lahcen Ikassrien, who was transferred to Spain from 
<br>Guantanamo in July 2005 and held in preventive detention 
<br>since his arrival. This comes less than a month after 
<br>prosecutors filed formal charges against Ikassrien, seeking 
<br>an eight-year prison term on charges of membership in a 
<br>terrorist organization. The case against Ikassrien is based 
<br>on three police interviews with him when he was being held at 
<br>Guantanamo (by the same investigators who interviewed 
<br>Abderrahaman) and on telephone intercepts developed in the 
<br>course of the Barakat Yarkas investigation, the same evidence 
<br>thrown out in the Abderrahaman case. (NOTE: According to 
<br>press reports, the Spanish police intercepts place Ikassrien 
<br>in Istanbul, Turkey in November 2000 along with suspected 
<br>terrorists Amer Azizi and Said Berraj. In a separate 
<br>intercept, Ikassrien requested assistance with documentation 
<br>from al-Qa'ida cell leader Barakat Yarkas). Prosecutors have 
<br>maintained that Ikassrien's own testimony since his transfer 
<br>from Guantanamo incriminates him since he has acknowledged 
<br>traveling to Afghanistan to "collaborate with the Islamist 
<br>regime." That is disputed by court observers who say that 
<br>Ikassrien's statements to the National Court have been 
<br>substantially less incriminating than those of Abderrahaman 
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Ikassrien's attorney has already homed in on 
<br>Guantanamo as key to his client's defense, focusing on 
<br>Ikassrien's alleged mistreatment while in US custody. The 
<br>attorney's request claims that "while Ikassrien was in 
<br>Guantanamo, he was gassed, beaten, mistreated, and insulted, 
<br>and subject to repeated inspections, during which the 
<br>military officials undertaking the inspections would damage 
<br>or destroy (Ikassrien's) books, especially the Koran." 
<br>Ikassrien's attorney also alleges that his client was 
<br>forcibly injected with a substance that led to severe itching 
<br>that continues to affect him. 
<br>
<br>//COMMENT// 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Spanish counter-terrorism legislation was designed 
<br>over three decades to combat ETA, a group with a defined 
<br>structure, doctrine, and modus operandi. Police, 
<br>prosecutors, and magistrates working on investigations of the 
<br>far more amorphous cells of Islamist extremist have struggled 
<br>to develop evidence sufficient to meet the high threshhold 
<br>set by the Spanish Supreme Court. This was reflected in an 
<br>earlier decision by the Supreme Court to reverse the 
<br>convictions of several Barakat Yarkas cell members and to 
<br>reduce Barakat Yarkas' sentence on the basis that prosecutors 
<br>had not proved his connection to the September 11 attacks in 
<br>the U.S. (USG observers of the trial noted that the evidence 
<br>on the September 11 connection was indeed weak). Clearly, in 
<br>the Abderrahaman case the Supreme Court was also eager to use 
<br>this case as a platform to criticize U.S. detainee policies 
<br>in Guantanamo. While this sentiment has not influenced 
<br>Spanish police to reduce their close collaboration with the 
<br>U.S. in fighting terrorism, we must take it into account as 
<br>we pursue increased judicial cooperation with Spain in 
<br>terrorism cases. The Spanish judiciary carefully guards its 
<br>independence (a major achievement of the post-Franco era) and 
<br>has not shied from taking decisions that cut across the 
<br>obectives of the Spanish Government.
