<br>SUBJECT: KARZAI ON THE STATE OF US-AFGHAN RELATIONS 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d
<br>).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY. In a series of meetings this week, I
<br>discussed with President Karzai a number of issues, including
<br>Karzai's concerns with the future of US policy on
<br>Afghanistan, and his opinions on where US policy here had
<br>failed. The meetings were cordial, but raised certain
<br>concerns for me about the status of the US-Afghan
<br>relationship, both in the lead up to the election and over
<br>the long term, should Karzai win reelection. Karzai's
<br>comments reinforce my belief that our relationship must be a
<br>two-way partnership of obligations and responsibilities. We
<br>must also convince Karzai to put his backing behind
<br>democratic institutions and professionalized security forces
<br>are better equipped to lead Afghanistan into the future,
<br>rather than Karzai's preference for tribal structures and
<br>informal power networks. This cable summarizes the content
<br>of these four recent meetings, as well as a subsequent
<br>conversation with Interior Minister Atmar. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) I met with Karzai on four occasions this week: on
<br>June 30 with COMISAF Gen. McChrystal and most of Karzai's
<br>national security team, and three times on July 1, xxxxxxxxxxxx, and
<br>finally with CODEL Ellsworth. Karzai maintained a calm
<br>demeanor throughout, but at several times displayed views
<br>that troubled me with their potential implications for
<br>US-Afghan relations. I also called on Atmar on July 2.
<br>
<br>Kandahar Incident
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) At the June 30 meeting with Karzai and his
<br>national security advisors, Gen. McChrystal and I briefed
<br>Karzai on a June 29 incident in which a USG-funded, equipped,
<br>and mentored paramilitary force attacked a Kandahar
<br>courthouse. The incident resulted in the deaths of several
<br>Afghan National Police officers. Karzai had earlier received
<br>phone calls from high-level US officials regretting the
<br>incident, so was calm and did not display the type of emotive
<br>anger he has shown following civilian casualty incidents. In
<br>the later one-on-one meeting with me, I reminded Karzai that
<br>he had selected and introduced this paramilitary unit's
<br>recruits to the USG in 2002, a fact that he had conveniently
<br>omitted in larger group settings.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Karzai insisted that units operating outside of
<br>the Afghan armed forces must be brought under the legitimate
<br>control of the Afghan government. Gen. McChrystal and I
<br>agreed that both counterterrorism paramilitary units and
<br>private security companies (PSCs) require more rigorous
<br>oversight and be brought under the eventual control of the
<br>Afghan government. PSCs required stronger regulations, yet
<br>the government should also adopt more transparent licensing
<br>procedures.
<br>
<br>US Policy on Afghanistan
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Karzai declared in all four meetings that he
<br>believed the US was not speaking clearly to Afghans on its
<br>goals in Afghanistan. Karzai contended that in 2002 the US
<br>had stated a clear purpose for being involved in Afghanistan
<br>but had lost its purpose over the past six years. As he has
<br>in past meetings with us, Karzai either stated his belief in
<br>or repeated rumors questioning the US commitment to a strong
<br>partnership with Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Karzai reported Pakistani intelligence officials
<br>had alleged to Afghan officials that the US intended to
<br>divide Pakistan and weaken Afghanistan in order to pursue its
<br>fight against terrorist groups. At the same time, Karzai
<br>accused Iran of trying to weaken Afghanistan by supporting
<br>the presidential campaign of Abdullah Abdullah in order to
<br>promote a decentralization agenda that would strip power from
<br>the central government to give to sub-national actors over
<br>whom Iran believed it would have more control.
<br>Incredulously, Karzai appeared to accept so-called rumors
<br>that the US and Iran were working together to support
<br>Abdullah against him.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) I pushed back strongly on this misinformation in
<br>the June 30 meeting with Karzai's national security team,
<br>reiterating to Karzai that there was no overt or covert US
<br>program to support any presidential candidate. I then asked
<br>Karzai if he took me at my word on this issue. Karzai,
<br>perhaps not wanting to back down in front of his advisors,
<br>said that he did not. Karzai said the US had actively
<br>encouraged Abdullah, Ashraf Ghani, and Zalmay Khalilzad to
<br>run for the presidency. At one point Karzai joked that I
<br>should "consult my (above) buddies" on national security
<br>issues. I repeated that the US had no favored candidates in
<br>
<br>Kabul 00001767 002 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>the race and the formal setting of the meeting was not a
<br>proper forum to make such inappropriate comments. He was
<br>embarrassed and helpfully shifted the conversation to another
<br>topic. I also urged Karzai to move away from conspiratorial
<br>thinking and instead focus on bringing ideas for the future
<br>into his campaign. Introducing a clear platform now will put
<br>him in a better position to move forward if he wins
<br>reelection.
<br>
<br>US Mistakes in Afghanistan
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Karzai and I held a one-on-one meeting shortly
<br>before meeting CODEL Ellsworth. Karzai agreed with my
<br>suggestion to make a better effort to present the case for
<br>continued and productive US engagement in his meetings with
<br>USG visitors from Washington. However, as the CODEL meeting
<br>began, Karzai reverted to old form and launched into a
<br>familiar review of the many instances where he believed the
<br>US had miscalculated its policies in the region. In summary:
<br>The US had failed to formulate an effective post-2001 policy
<br>on Pakistan, had pulled out of southern Afghanistan
<br>(particularly Helmand) too soon and given too much
<br>responsibility to ill-equipped and casualty-averse NATO
<br>allies, had failed to effectively engage with and pay respect
<br>to the importance of tribal leaders in Afghan society, and
<br>had allowed tribal leader networks to be decimated by
<br>insurgent attacks. I spoke up then, observing that I had
<br>visited Helmand several years ago before other NATO forces
<br>took over military operations there and witnessed signs that
<br>governance and security were declining under then-Gov. Sher
<br>Mohammed Akhundzada.
<br>
<br>Atmar on Karzai's Paranoia
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) I told Interior Minister Atmar at our July 2
<br>meeting that with his conspiratorial behavior, Karzai would
<br>run the risk of leaving USG interlocutors with the impression
<br>that we have accomplished very little here and that the
<br>Afghan government believed most of the failures lay with us.
<br>This is not a dialogue that will lead to an effective
<br>partnership. The US has been clear in its past shortcomings
<br>in Afghanistan, but we have yet to see Karzai admit to the
<br>serious shortcomings in his administration.
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Atmar agreed with the importance of Karzai
<br>presenting himself as a better international partner. He
<br>also detailed three existing paranoias that affected Karzai's
<br>worldview: (1) Karzai did not understand US policy in the
<br>region and suspected ulterior motives in our relationship
<br>with neighboring countries; (2) he suspected the US was
<br>contemplating a short-term strategy in Afghanistan that would
<br>result in our disengagement within the next two years; and
<br>(3) the US was intent on dumping Karzai and supporting
<br>another candidate. A fourth emerging paranoia was of a US
<br>plot to divide and weaken Pashtuns on both sides of the
<br>Afghan-Pakistani border. Despite these paranoias, Atmar
<br>assured me that Karzai had confidence in his personal
<br>relationship with me and recognized the need to meet more
<br>frequently to work through his misperceptions of US policy
<br>and intentions.
<br>
<br>Our Relationship with Karzai
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) In these meetings and other recent encounters
<br>with Karzai, two contrasting portraits emerge. The first is
<br>of a paranoid and weak individual unfamiliar with the basics
<br>of nation building and overly self-conscious that his time in
<br>the spotlight of glowing reviews from the international
<br>community has passed. The other is that of an ever-shrewd
<br>politician who sees himself as a nationalist hero who can
<br>save the country from being divided by the
<br>decentralization-focused agenda of Abdullah, other political
<br>rivals, neighboring countries, and the US. In order to
<br>recalibrate our relationship with Karzai, we must deal with
<br>and challenge both of these personalities.
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) The danger of long-term damage to our
<br>relationship with and thus our influence over Karzai ) who
<br>for now is the clear favorite to win the election ) is real,
<br>but not irreversible. We need to carefully ensure that the
<br>distance between us and Karzai does not grow over the
<br>remaining weeks before the election. Karzai has invited me
<br>for a series of one-on-one meetings in the near future.
<br>According to Atmar, Karzai recognizes the importance of a
<br>closer dialogue. I will use this opportunity and others to
<br>re-focus our dialogue on several points that can improve our
<br>mutual understanding, including:
<br>
<br>¶13. (S/NF) We need to seriously examine the issue of armed
<br>groups that currently operate outside of the purview of
<br>
<br>Kabul 00001767 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>official Afghan government control. The activities of
<br>paramilitary units and PSCs, combined with civilian
<br>casualties, night searches, and others issues related to the
<br>presence of foreign forces, play into the manifestation of
<br>Afghans' anger that they are not in control of their own
<br>country. Karzai claims only to be a vessel for his peoples'
<br>anger. All hubris aside, he is expressing a legitimate
<br>concern of his constituents. These problems will be a
<br>barrier to moving forward in other areas of our relationship
<br>until we have properly addressed them.
<br>
<br>¶14. (S/NF) At the same time, we must convince Karzai that
<br>the US-Afghan relationship is a two-way street of obligations
<br>and responsibilities. While we accept our own
<br>responsibilities, Karzai must accept and act on our
<br>expectation that he elucidate a clear vision for how he
<br>intends to lead Afghanistan over the next five years in a way
<br>that encourages democratization, promotes economic
<br>development, and recognizes the poisonous effects corruption
<br>has had on his government's ability to win the trust and
<br>respect of its people. If reelected, it is my hope that a
<br>Karzai who no longer needs to run for reelection will be
<br>better positioned and in a healthier frame of mind to pursue
<br>this agenda, as well as a meaningful national reconciliation.
<br>
<br>¶15. (S/NF) I will work now to lay the foundation for
<br>improved trust and advances on the two key themes outlined
<br>above. I will work in tandem with Gen. McChrystal on both of
<br>these fronts. On the discussion of shared responsibilities,
<br>I will begin a frank, collaborative (and perhaps, at times,
<br>confrontational) dialogue with Karzai. No alternative
<br>approach is now evident. Karzai's current vision for
<br>Afghanistan's future relies too strongly on warlords, tribal
<br>chiefs, and other personalities of the past who would be
<br>difficult to reconcile with our commitments to build strong
<br>government institutions and professional security forces.
