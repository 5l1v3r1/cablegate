<br>HOLBROOKE 
<br> 
<br>CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR RICHARD G. OLSON FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D. 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: During a March 24 meeting with Special 
<br>Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke, Abu 
<br>Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed (MbZ) expressed his grave 
<br>concerns about the Iranian threat to the region.  MbZ said the 
<br>Iranian response to the Nowruz message was primarily for domestic 
<br>consumption, but that the Iranian leadership is concerned that 
<br>dialogue with the West represents a regime threat.  He said Iran 
<br>would obtain a nuclear weapon unless the regime could be "split from 
<br>inside" before nuclear capability was achieved.  Foreign Minister 
<br>Abdullah bin Zayed argued for continued Gulf consultation in 
<br>conjunction with any U.S. efforts to engage Iran.  (Other topics 
<br>reported septel.)  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>NOWRUZ STATEMENT 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) MbZ began by telling Amb. Holbrooke that Khamenei's 
<br>response to President's Nowruz statement was designed to send a 
<br>message to the millions of Iranians who saw the statement on the 
<br>Internet that there will be no debate on engagement with the United 
<br>States and/or the West.  MbZ opined that Khamenei had to deliver the 
<br>message personally as an Ahmedinejad response would have fueled 
<br>domestic debate.  Commenting that Khamenei was conveying Iran's 
<br>fundamental lack of trust in the United States, MbZ said the Iranians 
<br>want an apology "for everything from Carter to Bush."  He added that 
<br>the uncharacteristic speed of Khamenei's response indicates the 
<br>extent of the perceived threat that improved relations with the West 
<br>might represent to the leadership's control over the country. 
<br>Specifically, the Iranian regime fears the United States will demand 
<br>the renunciation of its nuclear program, which would be politically 
<br>impossible. 
<br> 
<br>NUCLEAR WEAPONS A CERTAINTY, UNLESS REGIME FALLS 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) MbZ told Holbrooke he was "100 percent" convinced Iran will 
<br>complete its nuclear weapons program.  He candidly stated his 
<br>personal belief that negotiations with Iran were irrelevant and a 
<br>military solution would only delay the program, not derail it.  MbZ 
<br>said that there was a "third way" between these unacceptable options: 
<br> Iran is domestically very fragile, and the only way to prevent it 
<br>from acquiring nuclear weapons was to "split them from inside." 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Turning to his concerns about an armed confrontation, MbZ 
<br>said war with Iran would only harm the UAE.  He is deeply concerned 
<br>that the current Israeli government will initiate military action 
<br>without consultation.  An Israeli attack on Iran would have little 
<br>impact on Iran's capabilities, but MbZ was certain Iran would 
<br>respond.  MbZ argued that the leadership believes its own lies, which 
<br>were "proven" by Iran's success in Basra.  Today's conventional 
<br>Iranian weapons would target the Gulf, while Iran continues to expand 
<br>its missile program with the hope of reaching the West. 
<br> 
<br>CONSULT US 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan 
<br>(AbZ) stressed the importance of a continuation of the P5 plus 1 plus 
<br>GCC plus 3 coordination on Iran.  AbZ said that such consultation in 
<br>2008 "agitated" Iran, but sent a message to Russia and China and 
<br>European allies that the Gulf is seriously concerned about Iranian 
<br>hegemony.  Iran's regional hegemony and nuclear program are two 
<br>issues that the West cannot tackle separately.  AbZ noted that 
<br>countries in the region ("some friends") are concerned that the 
<br>United States, especially under the current administration, would 
<br>engage Iran at the expense of ties with the region.  AbZ said the 
<br>President's Nowruz message supported this theory.  He concluded, "The 
<br>more you engage Iran, the more you must engage the Gulf states." 
<br>(Ambassador Olson's comment:  Abdullah's reference to "friends" was 
<br>Emirati politesse - the UAE is deeply concerned that we are preparing 
<br>to trade, and is interpreting the Nowruz greeting in that way.) 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (SBU) Ambassador Holbrooke has cleared this message.
