<br>SUBJECT: SALEH STICKS TO HIS CT GUNS, BUT OFFERS A WAY OUT
<br>TO AQAP RANK AND FILE
<br>
<br>REF: A. SANAA 0014 
<br>¶B. 09 SANAA 1299
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Stephen Seche for reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY. After several successful counter-terrorism
<br>operations aimed at uprooting an entrenched al-Qaeda in the
<br>Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), President Saleh announced on
<br>January 9 that he was willing to negotiate with AQAP members
<br>who renounced violence, signaling a return to one of the
<br>tactics Saleh has used previously to control the wide
<br>spectrum of Islamic extremists in Yemen. With a variety of
<br>domestic actors ) from conservative clerics to the political
<br>opposition and the tribes - protesting the ROYG's recent
<br>strikes against AQAP, Saleh is feeling pressure to shore up
<br>his domestic political base by offering the possibility of a
<br>softer approach to AQAP's lower-ranking membership. He has
<br>not, however, shied away from his commitment to go after
<br>al-Qaeda's top leadership, which he understands is unlikely
<br>to either renounce terrorism or agree to negotiate with the
<br>ROYG, especially after a series of sweeping CT operations in
<br>December and January. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) During a January 9 interview with Abu Dhabi TV,
<br>President Saleh said that while he was willing to negotiate
<br>with members of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) who
<br>were willing to renounce violence, he would continue to
<br>pursue to the best of his abilities those who continued to
<br>engage in terrorism. "Dialogue is the best way ) even with
<br>al-Qaeda, if they set aside their weapons and return to
<br>reason," he said. Official news outlets, including 26
<br>September, al-Jamhurriya, and al-Mutamar, reprinted the
<br>complete text of the interview on January 10, signaling the
<br>government's official endorsement of the president's comment.
<br>(Note: The interview echoes his January 1 editorial in
<br>official al-Thawra newspaper, in which he called for the
<br>Houthis and AQAP to renounce violence and embrace dialogue
<br>with the government as well as his December 14 call for a
<br>National Dialogue to include a variety of societal actors
<br>(Ref A). End Note.)
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) xxxxx told PolOff on January 11 he was surprised
<br>at the president's openness in offering to talk to members of
<br>al-Qaeda, but that the ROYG has a history of dialogue through
<br>the rehabilitation program for "reformed" extremists. (Note:
<br>In the past, Minister of Religious Endowments Judge Hamoud
<br>Hitar ran a now-defunct rehabilitation program for religious
<br>extremists based on dialogue. End Note.) Saleh is known for
<br>negotiating with his domestic opponents, including al-Qaeda.
<br>For years, he has negotiated with, exploited, bribed and
<br>cajoled Islamic extremists in Yemen for his own political
<br>gain (Ref B). Even officials at the Ministry of Foreign
<br>Affairs (MFA), including Head of the North America Department
<br>Adil al-Sunaini, acknowledged that negotiating with AQAP is
<br>an "old government policy." "Our good president says things
<br>to play the old game and keep everyone under his thumb,"xxxxx
<br>told PolOff on January
<br>¶11. (Comment: Despite a history of negotiating with
<br>al-Qaeda, Saleh's current offer of dialogue to AQAP members
<br>who renounce violence is unlikely to apply to the group's
<br>hardened leadership. Instead, the president is likely
<br>appealing to his religious base by offering an "out" to the
<br>organization's rank and file, who, after a series of punitive
<br>operations against AQAP in December and January, might be
<br>looking for just such an opportunity. End Comment.)
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Saleh's remarks come after three weeks of public
<br>criticism of the ROYG's close CT cooperation with the U.S. -
<br>and specifically a December 17 airstrike in Abyan governorate
<br>- from a variety of domestic actors, including religious
<br>clerics, tribal leaders and the political opposition. One of
<br>the most significant challenges has come from the
<br>conservative religious establisment. In a January 8 Friday
<br>sermon, conservative Salafi cleric and powerful Islah member
<br>Abdulmajid al-Zindani railed against Yemen's CT cooperation
<br>with the U.S., accusing it of wanting to "occupy" Yemen,
<br>according to local press reports. Dubai-based al-Arabiya
<br>reported on January 11 that influential Aden-based Salafi
<br>cleric Ali Mohammed Umar said his followers would fight with
<br>AQAP against any American intervention in Yemen. "The
<br>president's two pillars of support are the military and the
<br>Salafis. These comments were for the Salafis," xxxxx said.
<br>xxxxx,
<br>told PolOff on January 11, "Do not give these remarks too
<br>much care. It is just a media statement." xxxxx pointed out
<br>that the remarks, made in Arabic on a Middle Eastern
<br>satellite TV channel, were intended for domestic - not
<br>
<br>Western - consumption. xxxxx, told EmbOff on January 11 thatxxxxx
<br>on the president's remarks
<br>because they were "not to be taken seriously."
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) While Saleh's remarks reflect a need to appease
<br>certain domestic constituencies upset by close cooperation
<br>with the U.S. against AQAP, he has not given any indications
<br>of shying away from future operations against AQAP
<br>leadership. In the same interview, Saleh said that
<br>terrorists are a "danger not just to Yemen,s security but to
<br>international security, especially al-Qaeda." While the
<br>president likes to keep all options on the table and never
<br>writes off the possibility of negotiations with any political
<br>opponent, his current offer is likely to apply to AQAP's rank
<br>and file - not its hardened, isolated and hunted leadership.
<br>In Yemen, especially, actions speak louder than words, and
<br>Saleh's actions have not yet wavered in uprooting al-Qaeda.
<br>End comment.
