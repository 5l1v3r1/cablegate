<br>SUBJECT: IAEA REPORTS ON IRAN AND SYRIA 
<br> 
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: ISN - C. S. ELIOT KANG, ACTING FOR 
<br>REASONS 1.4(B) AND (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (U) This is an action request.  See paragraphs 6-9. 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (SBU) International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
<br>Director General (DG) ElBaradei released his latest 
<br>reports on the status of the IAEA's investigations into 
<br>Iran and Syria's nuclear programs on 19 February 2009. 
<br>Both reports conformed to expectations in describing the 
<br>absence of any meaningful steps by either country to 
<br>address the serious issues that exist with respect to 
<br>their nuclear programs. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (SBU) With respect to Iran, DG ElBaradei's 
<br>description of the dichotomy between the stalled 
<br>investigation and rapid pace of Iran's centrifuge 
<br>advances is stark.  The report underscores the number of 
<br>outstanding issues that need to be clarified regarding 
<br>possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program. 
<br>The IAEA simply notes that it has "still not received a 
<br>positive reply from Iran" regarding its request for 
<br>access to relevant "information, documentation, 
<br>locations or individuals."  Consequently, "the Agency 
<br>has not made any substantive progress on these issues." 
<br>Iran's failure to cooperate with the IAEA in this regard 
<br>suggests Iran continues to wish to hide the nature of 
<br>these activities. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (SBU) At the same time, the IAEA reported that, far 
<br>from having complied with its UNSC obligation to suspend 
<br>its uranium enrichment and heavy water-related 
<br>activities, Iran has continued to expand its activities 
<br>at the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) and Arak Heavy 
<br>Water Research Reactor.  Approximately 5,500 centrifuges 
<br>are operating, up from approximately 3,800 in November 
<br>¶2008.  Of particular concern, the IAEA notes that since 
<br>February 2007, Iran has produced 1,010 kilograms of low 
<br>enriched uranium (LEU), a substantial increase over the 
<br>630 kilograms reported in November 2008.  Approximately 
<br>1,300 kilograms of LEU would be sufficient for one 
<br>nuclear weapon if Iran decided to go that route. 
<br>Currently, this material remains under IAEA safeguards. 
<br>Nevertheless, the risk posed in an Iranian breakout 
<br>scenario, either from diversion of safeguarded nuclear 
<br>material or through the covert enrichment of undeclared 
<br>nuclear material, is higher than in the past.  Morever, 
<br>Iran continues to deny the IAEA access to the Arak 
<br>reactor to conduct a Design Information Verification 
<br>inspection which would provide the IAEA assurances that 
<br>the construction of the reactor does not serve as a 
<br>pathway to divert nuclear material for weapons purposes. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (SBU) DG ElBaradei's report on Syria reinforces our 
<br>conclusion that Syria was engaged in a clandestine 
<br>effort to construct and operate a nuclear reactor at Al 
<br>Kibar.  The report also helps to confirm that uranium 
<br>found via environmental samples collected at the site is 
<br>not naturally occurring, lending credence to the fact 
<br>that the facility in question was a reactor.  Although 
<br>the report does not categorically dismiss Syria's 
<br>explanation that the uranium was from Israeli missiles 
<br>used in the attack on the reactor in September 2007, it 
<br>suggests that this explanation is highly unlikely. 
<br>Syria delivered an eleventh-hour letter on 17 February 
<br>2009 attempting to demonstrate a degree of cooperation 
<br>immediately before the report's release.  The report 
<br>notes that the responses in the Syrian letter "were only 
<br>partial ... and did not address most of the questions 
<br>raised in the Agency's communications."  Importantly, 
<br>the report also calls on Syria to allow access to other 
<br>locations and allow inspectors to take samples of the 
<br>debris removed from Al Kibar as soon as possible, noting 
<br>that these measures are "essential" for the IAEA to be 
<br>able complete its assessment. 
<br> 
<br>--------------- 
<br>Action Requests 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST FOR ALL POSTS:  Posts are 
<br>requested to convey U.S. views regarding the IAEA 
<br>reports to appropriate host governments.  Posts should 
<br>underscore that these reports demonstrate that neither 
<br>Iran nor Syria have taken any meaningful steps to 
<br>cooperate with the IAEA in the past six months.  Posts 
<br>should stress that Syria's refusal to do so only deepens 
<br>concerns regarding the nature of its clandestine nuclear 
<br>activities.  With respect to Iran, Posts should 
<br>emphasize that while Iran has stalled the IAEA's 
<br>investigation and still refuses to provide the IAEA with 
<br>requested transparency, its centrifuge program continues 
<br>to make progress.  The net result is that in neither 
<br>case can the international community have confidence in 
<br>the exclusively peaceful nature of these nuclear 
<br>programs.  For Iran, the UN Security Council has imposed 
<br>a mandatory requirement that it suspend all 
<br>proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and cooperate 
<br>fully with the IAEA.  On Iran, we should stress that 
<br>with international rights, come responsibilities.  Iran 
<br>needs to live up to those responsibilities.  We believe 
<br>that Iran's continued failure to do so is another 
<br>opportunity lost. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST FOR ALL POSTS CONT:  With 
<br>respect to the upcoming 2-6 March 2009 IAEA Board of 
<br>Governors' meeting, Posts should stress the need for the 
<br>following from host governments: 
<br> 
<br>-- Strong national statements on Iran and call on Iran 
<br>to impement its international nuclear obligations 
<br>without delay.  Statements should urge Iran to take 
<br>advantage of this critical opportunity for engagement by 
<br>addressing the concerns of the international community 
<br>and underscore the need for full transparency with the 
<br>IAEA (including Iran's implementation of the Additional 
<br>Protocol) and cooperation with the IAEA's investigation, 
<br>as well as suspension of all proliferation-sensitive 
<br>nuclear activities; 
<br> 
<br>-- Strong national statements on Syria and a demand that 
<br>Syria cooperate with the IAEA's investigation; 
<br> 
<br>--      Strengthened statements on Iran and Syria from 
<br>regional or other groups, e.g., European Union, the 
<br>Group of 77 and China, the Non-Aligned Movement, the 
<br>Group of Latin America and the Carribean; the Africa 
<br>Group, etc.  To the extent possible, Posts should 
<br>encourage host goverments to instruct their delegations 
<br>not to accept statements from any group to which they 
<br>are a member that would downplay the factual reports of 
<br>the IAEA, or undercut the Agency's ability to obtain the 
<br>necessary information and access needed to resolve these 
<br>serious issues; and, 
<br> 
<br>-- Board members should support, by vote if necessary, 
<br>releasing the Syria report to the public.  This is 
<br>essential for the public to appreciate the serious 
<br>nature of Syria's failure to cooperate with the IAEA. 
<br>This report will also demonstrate the level of 
<br>transparency in IAEA affairs that we believe Syria 
<br>should manifest in its approach to the IAEA. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S) ACTION REQUEST FOR UNVIE:  In addition to 
<br>conveying these messages to local IAEA Missions, UNVIE 
<br>should continue working to promote support within the 
<br>IAEA Secretariat and among IAEA Board Members for 
<br>continuing and expanding the investigation into both 
<br>Iran and Syria's nuclear activities and pressuring both 
<br>to cooperate with the respective investigations. 
<br>Mission is requested to place maximum effort into 
<br>securing strong national statements demanding Iranian 
<br>and Syrian cooperation with the IAEA by as many Board 
<br>members as possible, particularly those in the EU. 
<br>Mission should also work to support a P5+1 statement on 
<br>Iran.  Mission's efforts to build support for such 
<br>statements should begin as soon as possible, and will be 
<br>facilitated by technical briefings on Iran and Syria's 
<br>nuclear efforts to Board members in Washington and 
<br>Vienna the week prior to the Board meeting.  These 
<br>briefings will be provided by State and IC 
<br>nonproliferation experts.  Mission is also requested to 
<br>ensure that the IAEA Director General's forthcoming 
<br>report on Syria is made public, including by laying the 
<br>groundwork for a vote in the Board if necessary.  If 
<br>possible politically and statutorily, Mission should 
<br>seek the concurrent release of the November 2008 Syria 
<br>report, which was denied public release by NAM/Arab 
<br>intervention at the November 2008 Board meeting. 
<br>Mission should begin coordinating with likeminded Board 
<br>members at the earliest possible date. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S) ACTION REQUEST FOR LONDON, PARIS, MOSCOW, 
<br>BERLIN, AND BEIJING:  In addition to conveying U.S. 
<br>views regarding the Iran and Syria reports, Posts should 
<br>stress that the United States believes that the Iran 
<br>report reinforces the need for a strong P5+1 statement 
<br>demanding Iran's immediate and full cooperation with the 
<br>IAEA.  Discussions regarding specific texts will be 
<br>addressed in Vienna and Washington. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>POCS AND REPORTING DEADLINE 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (SBU) Mission is requested to report on the status 
<br>of its efforts in advance of the Board.  Richard Nephew 
<br>(202-647-7680) and Matt Goldstein (202-647-4196) are the 
<br>Department's POCs for this issue.
