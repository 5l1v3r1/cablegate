<br>
<br>REF: SECSTATE 10152; 08 LUANDA 536 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) The following responses are keyed to Department 
<br>queries (reftel): 
<br>
<br>A: Description of Chinese engagement in Angola: The Chinese are 
<br>heavily engaged in financing and implementing Angola's 
<br>reconstruction following the end of the nation's devastating civil 
<br>war in 2002. In the absence of a much anticipated (by the 
<br>Angolans) conference of Western donors to help fund reconstruction, 
<br>Angola turned to the Chinese. Chinese financing includes a (mostly 
<br>oil-backed) USD 4 billion line of credit through the Chinese Ex-Im 
<br>Bank. Although the terms of this line of credit are not entirely 
<br>clear, it seemingly provides concessionary interest rates and some 
<br>grace period for repayment. According to unconfirmed reports, an 
<br>additional line of credit of up to USD 4 to 6 billion has been 
<br>established through the Chinese Investment Fund (CIF), though Post 
<br>doubts that this fund, which was to have been funded by Chinese 
<br>investors, ever attracted enough Chinese capital to undertake 
<br>intended infrastructure projects in Angola. At the moment, the CIF 
<br>is partnering with state oil company Sonangol in extractive 
<br>industry ventures in Africa outside of Angola. 
<br>
<br>The Chinese Ex-Im Bank line of credit is linked to the use of 
<br>Chinese companies as prime contractors for Chinese-funded projects. 
<br>Many sub-contractors for these projects are Chinese companies as 
<br>well. Some of these companies have stayed in Angola after project 
<br>completion and are branching out into other areas, such as 
<br>import/export transactions and private housing. The feverish pace 
<br>of Chinese engagement in Angola cooled markedly in 2009 as the 
<br>global financial crisis gutted Angola's oil and diamond revenues, 
<br>precipitating sharp reductions in GRA expenditures. According to 
<br>the Chinese Ambassador in Luanda, China had to recall more than 
<br>25,000 workers in 2009 due to the lack of GRA funds to pay them. 
<br>Few new projects were launched in 2009, though most of those 
<br>previously underway continued, albeit often at a reduced pace. 
<br>However, those linked to preparations for the January 2010 Africa 
<br>Cup of Nations Football (soccer) Championship, which Angola hosted 
<br>by building four new stadiums, continued full-steam. 
<br>
<br>Recently concluded and currently underway infrastructure and 
<br>energy sector-related undertakings include: 
<br>
<br>---upgrading the electricity network in Luanda; 
<br>
<br>---rehabilitation of Angola's three railway lines: Luanda-Malanje 
<br>(completion in 2010); Namibe-Menongue (completion in 2011); and 
<br>Benguela-DRC(completion in 2012); 
<br>
<br>---improvements of infrastructure in Luanda, including building a 
<br>new international airport; 
<br>
<br>---numerous roads and highways outside of Luanda; 
<br>
<br>---social housing projects within Luanda; 
<br>
<br>---four football (soccer) stadiums (Luanda, Benguela, Lubango, and 
<br>Cabinda) that were used during the Africa Cup of Nations tournament 
<br>in January 2010; 
<br>
<br>---joint oil exploration venture with Angolan parastatal Sonangol 
<br>in Block 18; and 
<br>
<br>---a diamond mining venture with state diamond company Endiama. 
<br>
<br>¶B. Examples of U.S.-China cooperation in Angola. Chinese 
<br>contractors have successfully implemented DOD-funded humanitarian 
<br>assistance projects, and a Chinese national is engaged by an 
<br>implementing partner in our malaria program. 
<br>
<br>¶C. Potential areas for U.S.-China cooperation. As reported Ref B, 
<br>the Ambassador raised with the Chinese Ambassador in July 2008 the 
<br>concept of a joint agricultural development project, and the 
<br>Chinese Ambassador agreed to explore the possibilities. However, 
<br>determined efforts by USAID technical staff failed to identify a 
<br>project consistent with our development objectives to which the 
<br>Chinese could contribute meaningfully. Given shifts in FY-2010 
<br>USAID funding, Post will undertake again to explore possibilities 
<br>for cooperation with the Chinese in regard to either our expanding 
<br>agriculture program or in our malaria and/or HIV/AIDS programs. 
<br>Post experience has shown, however, that language can be a 
<br>considerable barrier; for example, the current Chinese Ambassador 
<br>speaks no Portuguese or English and only limited Spanish.

<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: The Chinese presence looms large in Angola. 
<br>Although exact numbers are elusive, a minimum of 50,000 Chinese are 
<br>in the country; most other estimates are markedly higher. Few 
<br>question that the Chinese have contributed importantly to Angola's 
<br>ongoing national reconstruction. Nonetheless, some Angolans 
<br>express concerns that Chinese engagement, financed by loans that 
<br>Angola needs to repay, has failed to create jobs for Angolans, has 
<br>failed to transfer technology to Angolans, and has often resulted 
<br>in poor quality performance. Concerns have also been raised about 
<br>the opaque nature of the Chinese funding, which is channeled 
<br>through the Office of National Reconstruction of the Presidency. 
<br>END COMMENT.
