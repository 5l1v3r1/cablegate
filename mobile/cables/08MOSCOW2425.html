<br>SUBJECT: PRESS BIAS SHIFTS IN FAVOR OF MEDVEDEV, BUT PUTIN
<br>STILL IN CONTROL
<br>
<br>Classified By: Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Alice G. Wells for reason
<br>1.4(d).
<br>
<br>¶1. Summary: xxxxx reported the results xxxxx in a recent meeting with PolOff. While
<br>Medvedev dominated Russian programming on four of five
<br>surveyed stations, his appearances were disproportionately
<br>ceremonial in contrast to Putin's hands on control of the
<br>Russian government. The virtual absence of airtime provided
<br>to most opposition parties continued to slow an already weak
<br>opposition, and experience and intuition told xxxxx that
<br>his study would fall on deaf ears, a prediction already
<br>supported by the empty auditorium at his press conference
<br>hours before our meeting. Russian Communist Party (KPRF)
<br>leader Gennadiy Zuganov publicly and privately praised
<br>xxxxx for his research as a boost to KPRF calls for
<br>greater press freedom. Medvedev's sagging standing in the
<br>polls, despite lavish T.V. coverage, is one indication of his
<br>difficulty in coming out from Putin's shadow. End Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>Medvedev Main Headliner, but Putin Top Dog
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On August 4, xxxxx told PolOff that while
<br>Medvedev received twice as much press coverage as Putin
<br>during the testing period, most of his meetings were largely
<br>ceremonial, while Putin's on-air performances continued to
<br>give the impression that he held the reins of power. xxxxx
<br>unabashedly called Medvedev a "no one" in Russian politics,
<br>claiming he was nothing more than a "pen in one's pocket" or
<br>"a glass on the table" as he raised a pen and glass from his
<br>desk. Medvedev continued to attract interest with his
<br>anti-corruption campaign, but Putin still called the shots
<br>that mattered.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) An August 7 poll from Levada Center indicated only 9%
<br>of Russians believe Medvedev controlled Russia's direction,
<br>while 36% believed Putin remained in sole power and almost
<br>50% saw a tandem presidency. A related Levada Center poll
<br>from July 18-22 showed that 82% of Russians believed, to some
<br>degree, that Medvedev merely continued Putin's policies,
<br>while only 11% saw Medvedev gradually changing the country's
<br>political course. Leading pollsters tended to agree with
<br>survey results. xxxxx hinted to
<br>PolOff on August 6 that Russians would probably see Medvedev
<br>as even less in control after Putin's recent Mechel comments
<br>and subsequent stock market scare. xxxxx told PolOff on
<br>August 8 that the then-emerging conflict in South Ossetia
<br>clearly painted Putin as the country's leader.
<br>
<br>
<br>Study Results: Winners Won, Losers Lost
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) xxxxx detailed the results of his recent
<br>research project on propaganda in the press, done in
<br>conjunction with Memo 98 Media Monitoring. The project
<br>tracked primetime press coverage of major political figures
<br>and government departments from June 5-20 on three
<br>government-run television stations (Channel One, TV Rossiya,
<br>and TV Center) and two privately-owned channels (NTV and REN
<br>TV). xxxxx ascribed a positive, neutral, or negative
<br>connotation to each news item, then calculated the total
<br>amount of time devoted to each person or group.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) The study revealed that all channels, except for
<br>REN TV, dedicated a disproportionate amount of airtime to
<br>positive or neutral coverage of incumbent politicians and
<br>cabinet members, rarely casting them in a negative light. REN
<br>TV, however, distributed airtime more evenly to a greater
<br>number of political parties and levied negative commentary
<br>against the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Vladimir
<br>Zhirinovskiy-led Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR).
<br>Most of REN TV's remaining coverage was neutral and biased.
<br>Stations devoted remaining airtime to less important
<br>government figures including Duma Speaker and Chairman of the
<br>High Council of United Russia Party Boris Gryzlov, First
<br>Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, Russian Minister for
<br>Emergency Situations Sergei Shoigu, Vice Premier and Finance
<br>Minister Alexei Kudrin, Regional Development Minister Dmitriy
<br>Kozak, and Economic Development Ministry chief Elvira
<br>Naibullina. xxxxx produced the following
<br>results:
<br>
<br>
<br>Channel One (16.9% market share, formerly ORT,
<br>state-controlled network): Medvedev (48.9%), Putin (22.9%),
<br>United Russia (6.1%), Russian Deputy Premier Sergei Ivanov
<br>(3.0%), A Just Russia (1.4%), FSB (1.3%), KPRF (0.3%).
<br>
<br>TV Rossiya (15.8% market share, formerly RTR,
<br>state-controlled network): Medvedev (50%), Putin (26.8%),
<br>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (2.7%), Ivanov (2.0%),
<br>United Russia (1.9%), FSB (0.9%), KPRF (0.9%), LDPR (0.8%), A
<br>Just Russia (0.1%).
<br>
<br>TV Center (4.2% market share, city of Moscow-owned national
<br>network): Medvedev (43.9%), United Russia (17.1%), Putin
<br>(16.9%), Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov (15.7%), Lavrov (4.8%),
<br>Ivanov (3.0%), A Just Russia (0.2%), FSB (0.1%).
<br>
<br>NTV (12.3% market share, Gazprom-owned national network):
<br>Medvedev (57.3%), Putin (17.6%), Ivanov (5.7%), United Russia
<br>(2.2%), Lavrov (2.0%), KPRF (1.1%), FSB (0.6%).
<br>
<br>REN TV (7.1% market share, Rossiya Bank majority ownership,
<br>independent network): Medvedev (28.6%), Zhirinovsky (12.2%),
<br>KPRF (12.0%), LDPR (12.0%), Yabloko (11.3%), United Russia
<br>(10.4%), Union of Right Forces (SPS) (6.7%), FSB (6.0%),
<br>Putin (2.1%), A Just Russia (0.8%).
<br>
<br>
<br>xxxxx and Communists: an Unexpected Alliance
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) xxxxx showed PolOff a letter from Zuganov that
<br>lavished praise on xxxxx his outstanding
<br>contribution to political reform in Russia. xxxxx then
<br>recalled to PolOff that Zuganov approached him at the Embassy
<br>Independence Day celebration at Spaso House, joyously thanked
<br>him in front of numerous witnesses, hugged him, and named
<br>xxxxx a "friend of the Communist Party." xxxxx retorted
<br>to Zuganov saying "I did not do this research for you, I did
<br>it for my country's future." xxxxx shuddered as he relayed
<br>the story, sheepishly noting that his grandfather and father
<br>would turn in their graves had they heard he had helped the
<br>Communists. (Note: xxxxx grandfather was shot and killed
<br>by Communists, and his father spent time in the Gulag)
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) On July 14, the Communist Party presented the results
<br>of the June 2008 Center for Research of Russian Political
<br>Culture's complementary study on press freedom and propaganda
<br>as it pertained to the KPRF. Zuganov noted that the study
<br>found 45% of all KPRF references to be decidedly negative and
<br>only 14% decidedly favorable. The Russian channel TVT
<br>provided the most negative coverage while NTV projected the
<br>KPRF most favorably. Considering xxxxx, however, NTV only dedicated about 1% of its
<br>programming to the KPRF; therefore, its resonance with and
<br>impact on the public remained minimal despite its positive
<br>tone.
<br>
<br>
<br>Opposition Hamstrung by Press Bias
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxx said data supported the opposition claim
<br>that they received less government-controlled airtime, but
<br>didn't address the GOR counter-charge that the classic
<br>"liberal" opposition is doing little to generate news. xxxxx agreed, charging that "Russians feed from the same
<br>information trough." xxxxx attributed much of the blame for
<br>the stagnation of Russia's political opposition to a lack of
<br>leadership; however, he claimed the lack of unbiased press
<br>coverage reinforced the Russian population's unwavering
<br>support of the current leadership.
<br>
<br>
<br>Press Research Lacks Public Influence
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) xxxxx bemoaned the fact that no one showed up to
<br>the August 4 press conference at the House of Journalists
<br>organized to discuss the results of his research. (Note:
<br>PolOff was the only attendee present) While he admitted that
<br>both he and the organizers did a poor job of informing the
<br>press and publicizing the event, he felt that the public's
<br>general ennui about press freedom contributed to the lack of
<br>attendance. When asked about the projected influence of his
<br>research, xxxxx told PolOff that he hoped organizations
<br>such as the UN and OSCE would utilize his analysis to
<br>advocate for greater political transparency in Russia.
<br>Conversely, he claimed the largest influence of his
<br>organization sprung from its relations with foreign
<br>journalists at the Washington Post, Le Monde, and other
<br>western papers. While his center operated quietly, trying not
<br>to attract attention, it cooperated with foreign journalists
<br>by supplying opinions and information for more scathing
<br>articles. xxxxx told PolOff with obvious delight, "when
<br>western press articles have infuriated Kremlin officials in
<br>the past, xxxxx
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) xxxxx data strikingly demonstrates that despite
<br>Medevedev's lavish courage in the media, he has yet to come
<br>out from Putin's shadow and create a political identity that
<br>resonates with Russian viewers.
