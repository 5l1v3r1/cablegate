<br>SUBJECT: NSA JONES' JUNE 25 MEETING WITH PRESIDENT ZARDARI 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Anne W. Patterson for reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: In their June 25 meeting in Islamabad, 
<br>National Security Advisor General James Jones and President 
<br>Zardari discussed: Pakistan's military offensive against 
<br>extremists; GOP capacity to fight terrorism; the nature of 
<br>extremism in Pakistan; drones; Iran; Afghanistan; Zardari's 
<br>conversation with Indian PM Singh in Russia; and the positive 
<br>trend of U. S. Pakistan relations. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) National Security Advisor General James Jones, 
<br>Ambassador, and delegation from the National Security Council 
<br>met President Zardari and a GOP delegation at the Presidency 
<br>on June 25. Pakistan's military campaign in Malakand and 
<br>Waziristan had been positively noted in the U.S., said Jones, 
<br>which welcomed the display of resolve. The trendline in 
<br>relations between the U.S. and Pakistan was positive, said 
<br>Jones. Zardari rejoined that the most important component of 
<br>the relationship was the goodwill expressed by the USG toward 
<br>Pakistan; his own tenure in office (ten months) was short and 
<br>his popularity not high, but goodwill from America was 
<br>central to his and Pakistan's future. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Pakistan was united, said Zardari: the people have 
<br>the will to support the military in its campaign to stop the 
<br>taliban/extremists operating in the country. He cautioned 
<br>that the fight against militant extremism would be a long 
<br>one, lasting not months but many, many years and that lack of 
<br>vigilance on the GOP's part would be devastating. As 
<br>confident as he was of the military's resolve -- this time 
<br>-- to fight Pakistani militancy, he was equally convinced 
<br>that any failure to maintain pressure on the militants after 
<br>showing such resolve would have grave consequences. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) President Zardari thanked the U.S. for its assistance 
<br>while stating he needed "a battalion of helicopters" to fight 
<br>the extremists now, and in the future. He also made repeated 
<br>pleas for drones to be "put in Pakistan's hands" so that 
<br>Pakistan would own the issue and drone attacks (including 
<br>collateral damage) would not provoke anti-americanism. 
<br>Zardari said the technology behind them was not cutting-edge 
<br>and said he has raised the issue with the Chairman of the 
<br>Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Journalist Bob Woodward (traveling with the NSA Jones 
<br>delegation) joined the meeting later and asked Zardari why he 
<br>had sharpened his attack on the extremists in the last six 
<br>months. "Organization," replied Zardari, who noted he had 
<br>been in office a short time and had used the first four 
<br>months to prepare. Pointing to the death of his 
<br>father-in-law Zulfikar Bhutto and assassination of his wife, 
<br>Benazir, Zardari said he had been confronting extremism (or 
<br>the ideology from which it was birthed) for more than thirty 
<br>years. His wife had been targeted for assassination as early 
<br>as 1988, when she was viewed as a symbol of feminism and all 
<br>that it represented. The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of 
<br>which he was the head (like the Bhuttos before him) had 
<br>always been ousted from power by the military, said Zardari, 
<br>which previously had been aligned with fundamentalism. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Jones asked Zardari how he viewed relations in the 
<br>region and told Zardari President Obama's own policy toward 
<br>Iran would have to be reexamined given events unfolding 
<br>there. Whatever had happened during the election, Iranian 
<br>leadership could not pretend nothing had occurred and return 
<br>as if there had been no shift. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Zardari noted that several tri-lateral forums had 
<br>been created in the region with the ostensible purpose of 
<br>supporting Afghanistan. He counseled that the USG must 
<br>"cooperate with Turkey, and Iran," acknowledging at the same 
<br>time that the GOP too was perplexed and disappointed by what 
<br>had happened in Iran. As to Afghanistan, he said all 
<br>countries had to be encouraged -- even if (as in the case of 
<br>Russia), only to be urged not to meddle. Zardari accused 
<br>India of providing the precursor chemicals necessary to 
<br>produce heroine, which he said was funding the taliban in 
<br>Afghanistan. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Asked by NSA Jones, what was the best that could be 
<br>hoped for in Afghanistan, Zardari spoke of substituting 
<br>hybrid corn for poppies, even if at a subsidized price, to 
<br>
<br>ISLAMABAD 00001438 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>wean farmers from the opium trade. He said China might be 
<br>interested or persuaded to invest in the venture. Zardari's 
<br>vision was to use that corn for ethanol production; he 
<br>welcomed the indication of interest shown by National 
<br>Geographic CEO John Fahey, and invited him to return to 
<br>Pakistan for a briefing on the concept. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) More broadly, Zardari praised the industriousness of 
<br>the Pashtun people. Currently they were "very good warriors," 
<br>but they were also natural entrepreneurs and the hardest 
<br>working people of Pakistan. If their entrepreneurial power 
<br>could be unleashed, the problems "in the Pashtun belt" would 
<br>largely be resolved. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Over the medium term, Pakistan had to built its 
<br>economy so that is could pay its own expenses to combat 
<br>extremism, added Zardari, who thought this possible if 
<br>exports could be increased three-fold. (He said he would 
<br>raise the issue with National Security Council Senior 
<br>Director Lipton in his upcoming visit to Pakistan.) He 
<br>thanked the USG for all it was doing to aid Pakistan and 
<br>asked for more financial assistance. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Zardari signaled that there had been some progress 
<br>in his talks with Indian PM Singh in Russia, even though he 
<br>had noted earlier that India's military capacity was ten-fold 
<br>Pakistan's. He regretted not being able to meet Singh at the 
<br>upcoming Sharm el-Sheikh summit but, he said, "unfortunately, 
<br>PM Gilani had already announced he would be going to Sharm" 
<br>(sic). In his meeting with Singh, said Zardari, he had 
<br>underscored that "there could not be a better political 
<br>moment" to improve relations across the board. India was a 
<br>mature democracy and an ancient nation, said Zardari. "Singh 
<br>is an excellent economist," he said, but Zardari was not 
<br>convinced the Indian Prime Minister understood the 
<br>constraints under which Zardari was operating. Helping Singh 
<br>to understand them was of import, hinted Zardari. NSC Senior 
<br>Director Don Camp said the Indian perspective was to question 
<br>GOP activism and to ask what it had done to quash terrorist 
<br>organizations. NSA Jones reminded Zardari how important it 
<br>was to ensure there was not another Mumbai-style attack. 
<br>Zardari reiterated that Singh was unaware of what it took to 
<br>"change the mind-set of Pakistan's "establishment," given 
<br>Pakistan's short history of fragile democratic regimes 
<br>toppled by the military. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) NSA Jones has cleared this cable.
