<br>SUBJECT: (S) UNMANNED USG AIRCRAFT WASHES ASHORE, OFFICIAL 
<br>MEDIA REPORTS DOWNED IRANIAN "SPY PLANE" 
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 32641 
<br>
<br>Classified By: CDA NABEEL KHOURY, FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) On March 27, Yemeni military officers discovered an 
<br>unmanned USG reconnaissance aircraft (Scan Eagle) that had 
<br>washed ashore on the Arabian Sea coast in the province of 
<br>Hadramaut. The President's Office immediately protested the 
<br>incident to CDA and requested an explanation. Initially 
<br>unaware of any USG operations in the area, Post learned after 
<br>further inquiry that the reconnaissance aircraft belonged to 
<br>the U.S.S. Ashland, which had been patrolling as part of 
<br>CTF-150, 60 nautical miles off the Yemeni coast. The 
<br>aircraft had crashed in international waters on March 17 and 
<br>had not been recovered. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) On March 28, CDA spoke with President Saleh (who was 
<br>attending the Arab League summit in Riyadh) via telephone and 
<br>confirmed that the aircraft belonged to the U.S. Navy. He 
<br>assured Saleh that the plane crashed performing routine 
<br>reconnaissance near the ship and had not been operating in 
<br>Yemeni territory. CDA also met separately with Interior 
<br>Minister Rashad Alimi and Ammar Saleh, Deputy Director of the 
<br>National Security Bureau, and presented both with general 
<br>information on the aircraft. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) President Saleh expressed doubt as to the plane's 
<br>actual mission, but promised CDA that the ROYG would not 
<br>"turn this into an international incident" and would instruct 
<br>government officials not to comment. On March 29, official 
<br>and pro-government media sources reported that the Yemeni 
<br>military had shot down an Iranian "spy plane" off the coast 
<br>of Hadramaut, after communicating with "multinational forces" 
<br>in the region. Independent daily Al-Ayam (largest 
<br>circulating independent newspaper), quoted an unnamed Yemeni 
<br>military official as confirming that the plane belonged to 
<br>the American government, but would not comment on whether the 
<br>plane was shot down or discovered after crashing. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Comment: President Saleh clearly believes the 
<br>unmanned aircraft had been performing reconnaissance in 
<br>Yemeni territory when it crashed. He could have taken the 
<br>opportunity to score political points by appearing tough in 
<br>public against the United States, but chose instead to blame 
<br>Iran. No doubt focused on the unrest in Saada and our 
<br>support for the transfer of excess armored personnel carriers 
<br>from neighboring countries (reftel), Saleh decided he would 
<br>benefit more from painting Iran as the bad guy in this case. 
<br>End Comment.
