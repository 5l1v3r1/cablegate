<br>Classified By: A/DCM JOSIAH ROSENBLATT, FOR REASONS 1.4 B/D 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: Islamic/international terrorism 
<br>investigating judge Jean-Francois Ricard (strictly protect) 
<br>told Poloffs May 6 that his section's open-ended 
<br>investigation into potential "jihadists to Iraq" has become 
<br>their current priority. With two networks already 
<br>discovered, French authorities fear that "jihadists to Iraq" 
<br>is a growing problem not unique to France, and one that will 
<br>affect other EU countries. Ricard also discussed the 
<br>ex-Guantanamo (GTMO) detainees (with the news that one 
<br>detainee may be released), the recent announcement of a GOF 
<br>"white paper" on terrorism, and C/T resource issues and 
<br>rivalries within the French government. End summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>PRIORITY ON "JIHADISTS TO IRAQ" INVESTIGATION 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) French press reported the arrests April 24 and 25 of 
<br>six people in the Paris and Marseilles areas suspected of 
<br>involvement in the recruitment and sending of potential 
<br>jihadists to Iraq. This is the second network uncovered in 
<br>France since an inquiry by the terrorism investigating judges 
<br>into "jihadists to Iraq" first began in September 2004. In 
<br>comparison to the first network (reftel), Ricard said two of 
<br>the suspects recently arrested had significant, long-standing 
<br>ties to Islamist circles. One of them, Said al-Maghrebi, had 
<br>in the past recruited European Muslims to fight in 
<br>Afghanistan. Ricard said he believed that France, and Europe 
<br>in general, was facing only the beginning stages of attempts 
<br>to form networks to fight jihad in Iraq. As an example, 
<br>Ricard said that GOF investigations into this most recent 
<br>network revealed that the suspects had significant ties to 
<br>other Islamists in England. The open-ended "jihadists to 
<br>Iraq" investigation is now the priority, said Ricard, based 
<br>on the premise that those going to Iraq not only endanger 
<br>Coalition forces and Iraqi stability, but upon return to 
<br>Europe, might constitute a significant terrorist threat. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br>ONE EX-GTMO DETAINEE MAY BE RELEASED "BEFORE THE SUMMER" 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) When asked about the status of the six ex-GTMO 
<br>detainees currently in pre-trial detention, Ricard said his 
<br>office was considering the release and dropping of charges 
<br>against Imad Kanouni, one of the original four ex-GTMO 
<br>detainees transferred to French custody. Ricard said Kanouni 
<br>had never undergone military training in Afghanistan, and 
<br>though active in extremist religious circles, they had no 
<br>evidence linking him to terrorism planning. The continued 
<br>detention of Kanouni could damage GOF cases against the 
<br>others, said Ricard. He said his office depended 
<br>significantly upon its reputation within the French justice 
<br>system, which tends to give the terrorism investigating 
<br>judges the benefit of the doubt. (As an example, Ricard said 
<br>that the proof against recently convicted Djamel Beghal and 
<br>his accomplices, accused of plotting to bomb the US Embassy, 
<br>would not normally be sufficient to convict them, but he 
<br>believed his office was successful because of their 
<br>reputation.) If they proceeded to trial with the information 
<br>they currently possessed on Kanouni, it would be clear that 
<br>the judges had been holding Kanouni without sufficient 
<br>evidence. Therefore, Ricard and fellow investigating judge 
<br>Jean-Louis Bruguiere are in favor of his release. Although 
<br>he cautioned that a formal decision had not yet been made, 
<br>Ricard said that Kanouni may be released "before the summer." 
<br>Turning to the eventual trial of the ex-GTMO detainees, 
<br>Ricard said he was in favor of trying them separately to 
<br>avoid the spectacle of multiple defense attorneys arrayed 
<br>against one prosecutor. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>GOF TO ANALYZE C/T IN A "WHITE BOOK" 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Prime Minister Raffarin announced on May 3 the 
<br>long-rumored commencement of a GOF "white paper" on internal 
<br>security and terrorism. Specifically, the goal of the white 
<br>paper will be to analyze and report on the type of terrorism 
<br>France might face in 2020 and the government's potential 
<br>responses. The report will be written by the General 
<br>Secretariat for National Defense (SGDN) in conjunction with 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>the Ministry of Interior, and will be given to President 
<br>Chirac in early 2006. The paper encompasses six areas, all 
<br>of which are being led by different ministries and 
<br>individuals. Pierre de Bousquet de Florian, head of the DST 
<br>(France's internal security service), will lead a group 
<br>studying possible threats; Pierre Brochand, head of the DGSE 
<br>(France's external intelligence service), will study 
<br>terrorist threats to world stability; Jean-Michel Hubert, 
<br>vice-president of the general council on information 
<br>technology within the Ministry of Finance, spearheads a group 
<br>on the use of technolgy by terrorists; Jean-Marie Huet, 
<br>director of Criminal Affairs within the Ministry of Justice, 
<br>will lead a group studying the role of the legal system in 
<br>combatting terrorism; Stanislas Lefebvre de Laboulaye, U/S 
<br>for Political Affairs-equivalent at the MFA, will study 
<br>international C/T cooperation; and Francois Heisbourg, 
<br>director of the Foundation for Strategic Research thinktank 
<br>(an organization closely linked to the French government) 
<br>will lead a group studying the involvement of citizens and 
<br>public outreach to combat terrorism. Heisbourg already heads 
<br>an effort by the GOF to put online a publicly accessible 
<br>database on terrorism. When asked about the "white book," 
<br>Ricard said he hoped it would result in the passage of 
<br>stiffer penalties for "terrorism conspiracy" charges, which 
<br>currently carries with it a maximum prison sentence of ten 
<br>years. A contact in the Interior Ministry told Poloff May 4 
<br>that the GOF hopes its white book will be taken up for 
<br>discussion by the European Union, with the goal of applying 
<br>many of its conclusions to the EU's counter-terrorism 
<br>approach. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>C/T RESOURCE ISSUES AND RIVALRIES 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) With the announcement in early April by Justice 
<br>Minister Perben that additional magistrates will be assigned 
<br>to counter-terrorism, Ricard said his section in the Paris 
<br>Prosecutor's office will likely grow from its current number 
<br>of five investigating judges to seven within the next year. 
<br>He said the investigating judges will also be given 
<br>additional support staff. Recruiting the investigating 
<br>judges has been difficult at first, said Ricard, given that 
<br>he and Bruguiere and the other veteran judges - Gilbert Thiel 
<br>and Laurence le Vert - have a distinct, more hierarchical, 
<br>work environment than is usually the case in the French 
<br>judiciary. Ricard also commented on recent press articles on 
<br>a renewed attempt by DNAT (the National Counter-Terrorism 
<br>Division, a section of France's judiciary police) to wrest 
<br>away from the DST that service's near-monopoly on Islamic 
<br>terrorism investigations. Currently, DNAT focuses on 
<br>Corsican and Basque terrorism investigations. Ricard 
<br>believed that the DST would continue its primary role, given 
<br>that it also is in charge of international liaison, and as 
<br>such, it is the recipient of terrorism-related information 
<br>from other countries, which is a key component of Islamic 
<br>terrorism investigations.
