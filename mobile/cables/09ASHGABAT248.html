<br>SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN: TURKISH AMBASSADOR CONCERNED ABOUT 
<br>POTENTIAL SHIPMENTS OF URANIUM TO IRAN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Charge Richard Miles, reasons 1.4(B), (D), (E) and (F). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) The Turkmen Government announced earlier this month 
<br>that President Berdimuhamedov had signed a decree allowing 
<br>the state chemical concern "Turkmenkhimiya" to enter into a 
<br>contract with Ekomet-S of Russia for the transfer and burial 
<br>of radioactive waste.  The waste was reportedly produced at 
<br>the Hazar chemical plant and at the Balkanabat iodine plant. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) In a meeting with the Charge on February 17, Turkish 
<br>Ambassador Huseyin Bichakli raised concerns about reports 
<br>that Turkmenistan and Russia plan to resume uranium 
<br>production in Turkmenistan.  He said that he had learned from 
<br>sources that a Russian military delegation had visited 
<br>Turkmenistan in early January and visited the site of a 
<br>former "uranium" plant at Kizilkaya in Balkan Province.  The 
<br>plant operated during the Soviet era.  He said that the 
<br>delegation was also briefed on the planned North-South 
<br>railroad line from Russia to Iran, which includes a 700 km 
<br>stretch through Turkmenistan.  Ambassador Bichakli said there 
<br>were rumors that the railroad would be used to transport 
<br>uranium processed at the currently inactive Turkmen uranium 
<br>plant to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) COMMENT: Ambassador Bichakli did not provide his 
<br>sources, but noted that for Turkmenistan to collaborate with 
<br>Russia to transport processed uranium to Iran, particularly 
<br>in a surreptitious manner, is inconsistent with its policy of 
<br>neutrality.  Post will report any further information on this 
<br>issue.  END COMMENT.
