<br>
<br>¶1. (C)  SUMMARY.  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric
<br>Edelman used his June 5 meeting with NATO PermReps and a
<br>separate session with NATO SYG de Hoop Scheffer to brief on
<br>his May 27-June 5 visit to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Lebanon
<br>and to urge Allies to contribute more to Afghan police
<br>training and use their political influence with Islamabad.
<br>USDP Edelman said he found President Karzai concerned about
<br>political turmoil in Pakistan and recent border developments.
<br>Meanwhile, Pakistan's new political leadership
<br>underestimates the threat from its domestic insurgency, and
<br>its military is in need of retraining to confront it.
<br>Regarding Lebanon, USDP Edelman was "more optimistic" than he
<br>had expected to be.  END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>------------------------
<br>AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C)  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Eric Edelman
<br>told NATO PermReps on June 5 that, after his recent visit to
<br>Kabul and Islamabad, he believes Afghanistan will require a
<br>long-term approach that focuses efforts on improving local
<br>governance and security.  Among his findings:
<br>
<br>- (C)  Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) are far along
<br>in their plans to assume leadership for security in Kabul
<br>city this summer.  ANSF are already providing "95 percent" of
<br>Kabul's security.
<br>
<br>- (C)  In the next few months, the U.S.-led Combined Security
<br>Transition Command- Afghanistan (CSTC-A) will be short more
<br>than 100 district-level 12-person Police Mentoring Teams
<br>(PMTs).  European countries are well-suited for the high-end
<br>training of police, and Germany and Italy have already
<br>expressed interest.  Focused District Development (FDD),
<br>CSTC-A's police training program, gets the Afghan National
<br>Police (ANP) to about "the 80 percent level", but PMTs are
<br>needed to mentor them and finish their training.  Edelman
<br>reported that on his visit to Kapisa province (in RC-East,
<br>where French forces will soon deploy) the difference was
<br>clear between towns where the ANP was trained and operating
<br>effectively versus areas where they were not and as a result
<br>the Taliban was active.
<br>
<br>- (C) Local governance is key to success.  USDP Edelman
<br>encouraged Allies to support the GoA's Independent
<br>Directorate for Local Governance (IDLG).  The estimated cost
<br>to implement the overall IDLG strategy over a five-year
<br>period is USD 296 million, of which USD 26 million is for
<br>IDLG's recently unveiled Afghan Social Outreach Program
<br>(ASOP) that focuses on developing local governance in eleven
<br>troubled provinces.
<br>
<br>- (C)  UN SRSG Kai Eide needs support, especially in New York
<br>where Allies should help ensure he gets the financial and
<br>staffing resources he requests.
<br>
<br>- (C)  The enemy is adaptive.  Officials in Regional Command
<br>East and Regional Command Capital have seen an uptick in
<br>insurgent attacks in Khost, Nangarhar, Kabul, and other areas
<br>where ISAF has been successful with its development projects.
<br>The enemy realizes it must destroy what has been built or
<br>risk losing the support of the people.
<br>
<br>USNATO 00000208  002 OF 004
<br>
<br>- (C)  The Pakistani leadership, including the President,
<br>Prime Minister, Defense Minister and new National Security
<br>Advisor all say they are committed to fighting terrorism.
<br>Edelman raised with them U.S. concerns about the peace
<br>agreements in the tribal areas, noting that ISAF already sees
<br>an increase in incidents in eastern Afghanistan attributable
<br>to reduced pressure on militants in Pakistan.
<br>
<br>- (C)  Pakistan has two fundamental problems:  the insurgency
<br>in the Federal Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), which the
<br>political class underestimates because it remains focused on
<br>political machinations in Islamabad; and the grave economic
<br>crisis, characterized by low growth and balance of payments
<br>problems, which are exacerbated by political instability.
<br>Edelman urged Allies to weigh in with Islamabad on the need
<br>for a strong counterinsurgency effort, to visit Pakistan at
<br>the senior level, and to consider economic development
<br>programs in the tribal areas.
<br>
<br>-----------------
<br>PermRep Questions
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) In response to the Greek ambassador, USDP Edelman
<br>commented that he is not overly concerned about the
<br>possibility that Karzai might seek to manipulate local
<br>governance and development programs for his electoral ends,
<br>because his political base and the root of the insurgency
<br>overlap in the Pashtun areas.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C)  In response to the UK ambassador, Edelman noted that
<br>Pakistani CHOD Kayani has told senior U.S. officials that he
<br>wants the Pakistani military out of politics, but he noted
<br>that the army needs retraining and reequipping to confront
<br>domestic extremists with a counterinsurgency strategy, since
<br>it is currently oriented towards the Indian threat.  In
<br>Kabul, Edelman added, he found Karzai eager to divert
<br>attention to Pakistan as a source of all of Afghanistan's
<br>problems.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C)  In response to the Czech ambassador, USDP Edelman
<br>commented that the U.S. wants to reinvigorate the Tripartite
<br>Commission and has a very active mil-to-mil relationship with
<br>Pakistan.  Admiral Mullen and other senior U.S. officials
<br>make frequent visits to Islamabad.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C)  In response to the French ambassador, Edelman said
<br>that neither ISAF nor the Afghan government has been
<br>successful on counternarcotics, and that eradication programs
<br>focus mostly on small farmers, making some Allies uneasy.
<br>Edelman urged greater focus on drug labs and high-value
<br>targets, such as drug traffickers who are also insurgents.
<br>He pointed out that U.S. Marines in Garmsir District of
<br>Helmand Province discovered a Taliban poppy "agro-business"
<br>had sprung up in the absence of a GoA/ISAF presence.  The UK
<br>ambassador added that going after traffickers and high-value
<br>targets has not had a negative effect on local opinion, in
<br>the UK's experience.  Ambassador Nuland commented that doing
<br>nothing about narcotics also damages ISAF's image with
<br>Afghans and noted "neutrality is not an option" when dealing
<br>with traffickers.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C)  In response to the Italian ambassador, Edelman
<br>commented that our efforts to strengthen local governance do
<br>not undermine the Afghan central government because there has
<br>never been a tradition of strong central government.  The
<br>
<br>USNATO 00000208  003 OF 004
<br>
<br>best approach is to improve local governance and then link it
<br>to the central government in Kabul.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C)  In response to the Norwegian ambassador, Edelman
<br>expressed optimism regarding the transition to the ANSF of
<br>security in Kabul, noting that the ANSF have shown
<br>improvement.  Regarding Provincial Reconstruction Teams
<br>(PRTs), Edelman similarly urged a phased transition to allow
<br>the Afghans to assume more and more responsibilities.
<br>Transition will occur at different paces in different places
<br>and should not be viewed as ISAF's exit strategy.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C)  In response to the Polish ambassador, Edelman said
<br>that Karzai sees two fronts (Iran and Pakistan) to his
<br>dilemmas.  Edelman noted that when the U.S. Marines went into
<br>Garmsir District recently, they learned a lot of new
<br>information about insurgent and narcotics activities, and he
<br>is concerned that a similar "blind spot" may exist in Nimruz
<br>along the border with Iran.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C)  In response to the Canadian representative, Edelman
<br>said that the notion of a unified approach to the Pashtun
<br>problems in both Afghanistan and Pakistan was something U.S.
<br>policy makers had considered, but it would be difficult to
<br>implement on both sides of the border.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>LEBANON
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) In response to the Greek ambassador, USDP Edelman
<br>said this was his third visit to Beirut in six months and he
<br>said he was "more optimistic than expected."  President
<br>Suleiman is now more self-assured than he had been as CHOD
<br>and gave an impressive inaugural speech.  Still to play out
<br>is the question of whether Hezbollah over-reached and damaged
<br>itself by taking up arms against Lebanese in the recent
<br>crisis.  He added that he is skeptical that the recent
<br>Syrian/Israeli dialogue will be successful given the nature
<br>of the Damascus regime.  Edelman noted that the U.S. is
<br>developing a good mil-to-mil bilateral relationship with
<br>Lebanon.
<br>
<br>-----------------------
<br>SecGen de Hoop Scheffer
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (S//NF)  In his conversation with NATO SYG Jaap de Hoop
<br>Scheffer, USDP Edelman said that he had raised with Karzai
<br>the latter's unhelpful comments in Der Spiegel ("I wish I Had
<br>the Taliban as My Soldiers"), and that Karzai apologized and
<br>claimed he was misquoted.  SecGen commented on a similar
<br>interview with the Indian press saying that such coverage
<br>could lead parliaments in troop contributing nations to
<br>question the value of sending their troops to Afghanistan.
<br>SecGen wondered aloud which Karzai would show up for the
<br>Afghan Donors, Conference in Paris-- the erratic Pashtun
<br>politician or the rational national leader.  Edelman observed
<br>that Karzai seemed preoccupied with blaming Pakistan for
<br>Afghanistan's problems.  SecGen responded that this does not
<br>bode well for efforts to reinvigorate the Tripartite
<br>Commission.
<br>
<br>¶13. (S//NF)  SecGen reported that attempts to update the
<br>Kosovo Operations Plan had run aground due to Turkish
<br>"paranoia".  The Turks have prevented PermReps from
<br>
<br>USNATO 00000208  004 OF 004
<br>
<br>discussing the updated plan because of concerns about their
<br>relationship with the European Union.  SecGen asked for U.S.
<br>assistance in convincing the Turks to be more flexible.
<br>
<br>¶14. (S//NF)  SecGen indicated that he disagreed with the U.S.
<br>response to Turkish complaints about the possible involvement
<br>of Greek aircraft from a disputed island in the Aegean in
<br>NATO exercises.  He is concerned that this could lead toward
<br>a situation in which NATO could never exercise in the Aegean.
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) USDP Edelman has cleared this cable.
