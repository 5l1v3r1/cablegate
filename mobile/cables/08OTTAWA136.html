<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)
<br>has long gone to great pains to highlight the distinction
<br>between Americans and Canadians in its programming, generally
<br>at our expense. However, the level of anti-American melodrama
<br>has been given a huge boost in the current television season
<br>as a number of programs offer Canadian viewers their fill of
<br>nefarious American officials carrying out equally nefarious
<br>deeds in Canada while Canadian officials either oppose them
<br>or fall trying.  CIA rendition flights, schemes to steal
<br>Canada's water, "the Guantanamo-Syria express," F-16's flying
<br>in for bombing runs in Quebec to eliminate escaped
<br>terrorists:  in response to the onslaught, one media
<br>commentator concluded, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that
<br>"apparently, our immigration department's real enemies aren't
<br>terrorists or smugglers -- they're Americans."  While this
<br>situation hardly constitutes a public diplomacy crisis per
<br>se, the degree of comfort with which Canadian broadcast
<br>entities, including those financed by Canadian tax dollars,
<br>twist current events to feed long-standing negative images of
<br>the U.S. -- and the extent to which the Canadian public seems
<br>willing to indulge in the feast - is noteworthy as an
<br>indication of the kind of insidious negative popular
<br>stereotyping we are increasingly up against in Canada.  End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>"THE BORDER" -CANADA'S ANSWER TO 24, W/O THAT SUTHERLAND GUY
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) When American TV and movie producers want action,
<br>the formula involves Middle Eastern terrorists, a ticking
<br>nuclear device, and a (somewhat ironically, Canadian) guy
<br>named Sutherland.  Canadian producers don't need to look so
<br>far -- they can find all the action they need right on the
<br>U.S.-Canadian border.  This piece of real estate, which most
<br>Americans associate with snow blowing back and forth across
<br>an imaginary line, has for the past three weeks been for
<br>Canadian viewers the site of downed rendition flights, F-16
<br>bombing runs, and terrorist suspects being whisked away to
<br>Middle Eastern torture facilities. "The Border," which
<br>state-owned CBC premiered on January 7, attracted an
<br>impressive 710,000 viewers on its first showing -- not
<br>exactly Hockey Night in Canada, but equivalent to an American
<br>program drawing about eight million U.S. viewers.  The show
<br>depicts Canadian immigration and customs officers' efforts to
<br>secure the U.S.-Canadian border and the litany of moral
<br>dilemmas they face in doing so.  The CBC bills the
<br>high-budget program as depicting the "new war" on the border
<br>and "the few who fight it."  While the "war" is supposed to
<br>be against criminals and terrorists trying to cross the
<br>border, many of the immigration team's battles end up being
<br>with U.S. government officials, often in tandem with the
<br>CIA-colluding Canadian Security and Intelligence Service
<br>(CSIS).
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The clash between the Americans and Canadians got
<br>started early in the season and has continued unabated.  In
<br>episode one a Syrian terrorist with a belt full of gel-based
<br>explosives is removed from a plane in Canada while the
<br>Canadian-Syrian man sitting next to him is rendered by the
<br>CIA/CSIS team to Syria -- a fairly transparent reference to
<br>QCIA/CSIS team to Syria -- a fairly transparent reference to
<br>the Maher Arar case.  Fortunately for the incarcerated
<br>individual, the sympathetic Canadian Immigration and Customs
<br>Security official recognizes the mistake and shrewdly causes
<br>the government to rescue him from a Syrian jail through
<br>organized media pressure.  The episode ends with a preview of
<br>things to come when one of the Canadian immigration officers
<br>notes with disgust, "Homeland Security is sending in some hot
<br>shot agent."
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Episode two expands on this theme, featuring the
<br>arrival of an arrogant, albeit stunningly attractive female
<br>DHS officer, sort of a cross between Salma Hayek and Cruella
<br>De Vil.  The show portrays the DHS official bossing around
<br>her stereotypically more compassionate Canadian colleagues
<br>while uttering such classic lines as, "Who do you think
<br>provides the muscle to protect your fine ideals?" and "You
<br>would have killed him.  Let the American justice system do it
<br>for you."  Her fallback line in most situations is "it's a
<br>matter of national security."
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) But the one-liners and cross-border stereotypes
<br>really take off in episode three, in which an American
<br>
<br>OTTAWA 00000136  002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>rendition aircraft with three terrorist suspects on the
<br>"Guantanamo to Syria express" crashes in Quebec and the
<br>terrorists escape -- however, not before killing a Quebec
<br>police officer, whose sympathetic widow appears throughout
<br>the show.  The DHS officer's answer to everything is American
<br>firepower, but in this episode even CSIS gets a chance at
<br>redemption as the CSIS officer in charge challenges her. Ms.
<br>DHS barks back, "You really want to talk territorial
<br>sovereignty, or should we talk about getting the terrorists
<br>back?"  After being chased through the woods of Quebec by a
<br>cross-culturally balanced CSIS-JTF2 team which kills a
<br>15-year-old terrorist in a shootout, the bad guys are finally
<br>cornered on the side of a pristine Canadian lake.  Then,
<br>after a conversation with Washington in which she asks "can
<br>you bypass NSA and State?", our DHS official calls in an
<br>air-strike on the terrorists without Canadian concurrence.
<br>Canadian planes, another official has explained, are "already
<br>deployed to Afghanistan, helping our neighbors fight their
<br>war on terror."  With only seconds to spare before the bombs
<br>are dropped on the Quebec site, the planes are called off
<br>when the CSIS-JTF team affirms positive control over the
<br>terrorists.  Finally, in a last-minute allowance for
<br>redemption, the CSIS officer informs his DHS colleague that
<br>the captured terrorists will not be turned over to the U.S.
<br>but will stand trial for the death of the Quebec police
<br>officer.  She does get the final word, though, hissing the
<br>classic phrase "you people are so nave," before the screen
<br>goes blank.
<br>
<br>DEA ALSO TAKES SOME HITS
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) If that isn't enough, "the Border" is only one of
<br>the CBC programs featuring cross-border relations.
<br>"Intelligence," which depicts a Canadian intelligence unit
<br>collaborating with a local drug lord-turned government
<br>informant, is just as stinging in its portrayal of
<br>U.S.-Canada law enforcement cooperation.  Through its two
<br>seasons, the program has followed plot lines including a DEA
<br>attempt to frame the Canadian informant for murder, a CIA
<br>plot to secretly divert Canadian water to the American
<br>southwest, and a rogue DEA team that actually starts selling
<br>drugs for a profit.  A columnist in conservative Canadian
<br>daily newspaper "The National Post" commented, "There's no
<br>question that the CSIS heroes on 'Intelligence' consider the
<br>Americans our most dangerous enemies."
<br>
<br>EVEN THE LITTLE MOSQUE GETS IN TO THE ACT
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Even "Little Mosque on the Prairie," a popular
<br>Canadian sitcom that depicts a Muslim community in a small
<br>Saskatchewan town, has joined the trend of featuring
<br>U.S.-Canada border relations.  This time, however, the State
<br>Department is the fall guy.  A December 2007 episode
<br>portrayed a Muslim economics professor trying to remove his
<br>name from the No-Fly-List at a U.S. consulate.  The show
<br>depicts a rude and eccentric U.S. consular officer
<br>stereotypically attempting to find any excuse to avoid being
<br>helpful.  Another episode depicted how an innocent trip
<br>across the border became a jumble of frayed nerves as Grandpa
<br>was scurried into secondary by U.S. border officials because
<br>his name matched something on the watch list.
<br>Qhis name matched something on the watch list.
<br>
<br>GIVE US YOUR WATER; OH WHAT THE HECK WE'LL TAKE YOUR COUNTRY
<br>TOO
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) And it appears that the season is just warming up.
<br>After CIA renditions, DEA murder plots, DHS missteps, and
<br>unhelpful consular officers, a U.S. takeover of Canada may
<br>have been the only theme left for the CBC "H20" mini-series.
<br>The series was first broadcast in 2005, when it featured an
<br>investigation into an American assassination of the Canadian
<br>prime minister and a very broad-based (and wildly
<br>implausible) U.S. scheme to steal Canadian water.  A two-part
<br>sequel, set to be broadcast in March and April 2008, will
<br>portray the United States as manipulating innocent, trusting
<br>Canadians into voting in favor of Canada's becoming part of
<br>the United States.  Then, after the United States completely
<br>takes over Canada, one brave Canadian unites Canadians and
<br>Europeans in an attempt to end America's hegemony.  Another
<br>
<br>OTTAWA 00000136  003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>program could prove more benign but will certainly include
<br>its share of digs against all things American:  Global TV
<br>reportedly is gearing up for a March 2008 debut of its own
<br>border security drama, set to feature Canadian
<br>search-and-rescue officers patrolling the U.S.-Canada border.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) EKOS pollster Frank Graves told Poloff he thought
<br>that at this point such shows are reflective and not causal
<br>in determining attitudes in Canada.  They play on the
<br>deep-seated caution most Canadians feel toward their large
<br>neighbor to the south, a sort of zeitgeist that has been in
<br>the background for decades.  As one example, a December 2007
<br>Strategic Counsel poll showed that nine percent of Canadians
<br>thought U.S. foreign policy was the greatest threat to the
<br>world -- twice as high as those who were concerned about
<br>weapons of mass destruction.  What Graves does find
<br>disturbing -- and here he believes that the causal or
<br>reflective question is not important -- is that support for a
<br>less porous border is increasing in both Canada and the U.S.:
<br>in the U.S. because of generalized fear of terrorism and in
<br>Canada because of concern over guns, sovereignty, and the
<br>impact that a terrorist attack on the U.S. would have on
<br>trade.  Graves has detected an increasingly wary attitude
<br>over the border that he believes could lead to greater
<br>distance between the two countries.
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) While there is no single answer to this trend, it
<br>does serve to demonstrate the importance of constant
<br>creative, and adequately-funded public-diplomacy engagement
<br>with Canadians, at all levels and in virtually all parts of
<br>the country.  We need to do everything we can to make it more
<br>difficult for Canadians to fall into the trap of seeing all
<br>U.S. policies as the result of nefarious faceless U.S.
<br>bureaucrats anxious to squeeze their northern neighbor.
<br>While there are those who may rate the need for USG
<br>public-diplomacy programs as less vital in Canada than in
<br>other nations because our societies are so much alike, we
<br>clearly have real challenges here that simply must be
<br>adequately addressed.
