<br>SUBJECT: (S) TURKISH FIRMS ENGAGED IN MILITARY 
<br>MATERIEL-RELATED DEALS WITH IRAN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: EUR/PRA Director Stephanie Miley 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request to Embassy Ankara.  Please 
<br>see paragraph 7. 
<br> 
<br>---------- 
<br>BACKGROUND 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) The U.S. has information about several transactions 
<br>involving Turkish firms planning to export and import from 
<br>Iran arms and related material controlled by the Wassenaar 
<br>Arrangement.  Specifically, Iran is interested in procuring 
<br>Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) .38 caliber and wadcutter bullets; 40 
<br>mm automatic grenade launchers; 5.56 mm composite magazines 
<br>(for M16 assault rifles), and 7.62 X 39 mm and 7.62 X 51 mm 
<br>composite magazines from Turkey.  In addition, we understand 
<br>that a Turkish firm may also be pursuing a deal to import 
<br>plastic explosives and nitrocellulose from Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) The U.S. wants to provide this information to Turkish 
<br>officials, request that they investigate this activity and 
<br>use all available means to prevent these firms from exporting 
<br>and importing such arms to and from Iran.  In addition to any 
<br>domestic Turkish authorities that may apply, these activities 
<br>may also be in violation of both United Nations Security 
<br>Resolution (UNSCR) 1747 and U.S. domestic authorities. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) UNSCR 1747: UNSCR 1747, paragraph 5, prohibits Iran 
<br>from supplying, selling or transferring from its territory 
<br>any "arms or related materiel."  It also requires all states 
<br>to prohibit the procurement of such items from Iran by their 
<br>nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft; whether 
<br>or not such transfers originated in the territory of Iran. 
<br>The procurement of plastic explosives from Iran would violate 
<br>UNSCR 1747. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) The Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act 
<br>(INKSNA): INKSNA authorizes sanctions against any foreign 
<br>person that transfers to or from Iran, North Korea, or Syria 
<br>goods, services, or technology controlled by multilateral 
<br>control lists (e.g., Nuclear Suppliers Group, Missile 
<br>Technology Control Regime, Australia Group, or Wassenaar 
<br>Arrangement); of the same kind as those on multilateral 
<br>control lists, but falling below the control list parameters, 
<br>when it is determined that such goods, services, and 
<br>technologies have the potential to make a material 
<br>contribution to WMD, or cruise or ballistic missile systems; 
<br>on U.S. national control lists for WMD/missile reasons that 
<br>are not on multilateral lists; or with the potential of 
<br>making a material contribution to WMD, or cruise or ballistic 
<br>missile systems.  Accordingly, the U.S. is concerned that if 
<br>the Turkish firms proceed with transferring the grenade 
<br>launchers, bullets, and ammunition magazines, we would be 
<br>required to report this to the U.S. Congress and the Turkish 
<br>firms could be subject to U.S. sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) The U.S. is also concerned about the potential exports 
<br>to Iran because one of the items may be of U.S. origin. 
<br>According to Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) 
<br>records, Turkey received 181 MK-19 40 mm grenade launchers 
<br>from the United States in 1995.  However, we do not know 
<br>definitively if any of these are among the 40 mm grenade 
<br>launchers contemplated as part of the sale to Iran.  We note, 
<br>however, that if any U.S.-origin defense equipment (including 
<br>technical data) is re-transferred to Iran, that would violate 
<br>Section 3 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).  As a 
<br>consequence, Turkey could lose its country eligibility under 
<br>the AECA to purchase or lease defense articles, including 
<br>Patriot or Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles, or services, or 
<br>to receive credits or guarantees relating to any purchase or 
<br>lease. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>ACTION REQUEST/OBJECTIVES 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) Post is requested to approach GOT officials to pursue 
<br>the following objectives and to deliver the talking 
<br>points/non-paper in paragraph 8 below as appropriate: 
<br> 
<br>-- Thank Turkish officials for Turkey's continued cooperation 
<br>and support in preventing the transfer of arms or related 
<br>material to and from Iran; 
<br> 
<br>-- Inform the GOT that we are very concerned that Turkish 
<br>firms may be exporting to and importing from Iran arms and 
<br>related material; 
<br> 
<br>-- Note that the export of Wassenaar Arrangement controlled 
<br>items to Iran could require a report to the U.S. Congress 
<br>under the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act 
<br>(INKSNA) and may result in sanctions being imposed on the 
<br>entities and individuals involved; 
<br> 
<br>-- Point out that the import of arms or related material from 
<br>Iran would violate UNSCR 1747, which prohibits Iran from 
<br>supplying, selling or transferring from its territory any 
<br>"arms or related materiel" and requires all states to 
<br>prohibit the procurement of such items from Iran by their 
<br>nationals; 
<br> 
<br>-- Emphasize this is not the time for business as usual with 
<br>Iran; 
<br> 
<br>-- Remind the GOT that both the DIO and Parchin were 
<br>designated for an asset freeze under UNSCRs 1737 and 1747, 
<br>respectively, and were sanctioned by the U.S. under Executive 
<br>Order (E.O.) 13382; 
<br> 
<br>-- Strongly urge the GOT to use available legal authorities, 
<br>including appropriate domestic laws and authorities related 
<br>to implementing UNSCRs 1737 and 1747, to immediately 
<br>terminate these deals and freeze any assets of DIO; 
<br> 
<br>-- Note that Iran has a long history of providing arms and 
<br>other military equipment to terrorist groups and that these 
<br>items could easily end up in the hands of al-Qaida, Hamas, 
<br>Hizballah, and the Taliban; 
<br> 
<br>-------------- 
<br>TALKING POINTS 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S//REL TURKEY) Begin talking  points: 
<br> 
<br>-- We appreciate the Government of Turkey's continued 
<br>cooperation and support in preventing the transfer of 
<br>military equipment and related materiel to and from Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- In the spirit of this cooperation, we want to share with 
<br>you some additional information about Turkish firms involved 
<br>in dealings concerning arms and related materiel with Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--------------- 
<br>EXPORTS TO IRAN 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>-- We have information that the Turkish firms Mercan Tanitim 
<br>Dis Ticaret ve Muhendislik Ltd. and Makina ve Kimya 
<br>Endustrisi Kurumu (MKEK) may sign a contract to export 
<br>military material to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- The items covered by the contract include: FMJ (Full Metal 
<br>Jacket) .38 caliber and wadcutter bullets; 40 mm automatic 
<br>grenade launchers; 5.56 mm composite magazines (for M16 
<br>assault rifles), and 7.62 X 39 mm and 7.62 X 51 mm composite 
<br>magazines, all of which are specified on the Wassenaar 
<br>Arrangement Munitions List. 
<br> 
<br>-- In addition, according to the Defense Security Cooperation 
<br>Agency (DSCA) records, Turkey received 181 MK-19 40 mm 
<br>grenade launchers from the United States in 1995.  We do not 
<br>know, definitively, if any of these were among the 40 mm 
<br>grenade launchers contemplated as part of the sale to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- We should note, however, that if any U.S.-origin defense 
<br>equipment (including technical data) is re-transferred to 
<br>Iran, that transfer would violate Section 3 of the U.S. Arms 
<br>Export Control Act (AECA).  As a consequence, Turkey could 
<br>lose its country eligibility under the AECA to purchase or 
<br>lease defense articles.  This could potentially include 
<br>Patriot or Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles, or services, or 
<br>the ability to receive credits or guarantees relating to any 
<br>purchase or lease. 
<br> 
<br>----------------- 
<br>IMPORTS FROM IRAN 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>-- In addition to our information related to the export of 
<br>arms material to Iran, we also understand some of the same 
<br>Turkish firms involved in the exports are interested in 
<br>procuring arms material from Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- Specifically, we understand that in September 2009, Mercan 
<br>Tanitim was pursuing a deal with MKEK to import 2,000 kg of 
<br>Composition A-4 military plastic explosives produced by 
<br>Parchin Chemical Industries, an Iranian government military 
<br>company and an element of the Defense Industries Organization 
<br> 
<br>(DIO). 
<br> 
<br>-- We further understand that in September 2009, the Turkish 
<br>companies Kolorkim Kimya San and Mercan Tanitim were 
<br>considering a deal to import nitrocellulose (NC) from Iran. 
<br>NC is a dual-use material that serves as a major component in 
<br>smokeless gunpowder. 
<br> 
<br>-- As a subordinate of DIO, Parchin acts on behalf of DIO, 
<br>importing and exporting chemical goods throughout the world. 
<br>In April 2007, Parchin Chemical Industries was identified as 
<br>the final recipient of sodium perchlorate monohydrate, a 
<br>chemical precursor for solid propellant oxidizer, possibly to 
<br>be used for ballistic missiles. 
<br> 
<br>-- As you know, DIO is one of seven Iranian nuclear-related 
<br>entities designated for an asset freeze in the Annex to UNSCR 
<br>¶1737.  In addition to being listed in the Annex for UNSCR 
<br>1737, DIO was sanctioned previously by the United States for 
<br>WMD- or missile-related activities under the Iran and Syria 
<br>Nonproliferation Act (ISNA), the Arms Export Control Act 
<br>(AECA), Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, and the Export 
<br>Administration Act. 
<br> 
<br>-- We would further note that Parchin Chemical Industries has 
<br>been designated for an asset freeze under UNSCR 1747 and U.S. 
<br>E.O. 13382 in July 2008 as a consequence of its work on 
<br>behalf of Iran's ballistic missile program.  We, therefore, 
<br>urge you, per UNSCR 1747, to freeze any assets of Parchin 
<br>Chemical Industries that may come under Turkish jurisdiction. 
<br> 
<br>-- We would like to inform you that Turkish firms engaged in 
<br>business with entities designated under E.O. 13382 are 
<br>eligible for sanctions if such activities are not halted. 
<br> 
<br>-- Given the UN Security Council's grave concern over Iran's 
<br>nuclear and ballistic missile program activities, we urge you 
<br>to encourage all Turkish firms to avoid any affiliation with 
<br>this company. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran, a U.S.-designated State Sponsor of Terrorism, has a 
<br>long history of providing arms and other military equipment 
<br>to terrorist groups and other non-state actors, including in 
<br>Iraq, Afghanistan, and Lebanon.  We are concerned that the 
<br>materials being negotiated for transfer by the Turkish 
<br>companies in question could be diverted by Iran to such 
<br>groups. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran has long supplied non-state actors, including 
<br>terrorist groups such as Hizballah, with arms and other 
<br>military equipment.  The terrorist applications of small arms 
<br>and light weapons (SA/LW) are obvious, but Iran has also 
<br>supplied terrorists with larger weapons systems that threaten 
<br>regional security and stability. 
<br> 
<br>-- Failure to prevent these sales could result in the 
<br>re-transfer of military material and explosives by Iran to 
<br>groups like al-Qaida, Hamas, Hizballah, and the Taliban. 
<br>This would harm the Turkish government's reputation as a NATO 
<br>ally and demonstrated opponent of terrorism, and would 
<br>reflect badly on the Turkish business community. 
<br> 
<br>-- These transactions could also be damaging to our bilateral 
<br>relationship as these items can be used to kill and severely 
<br>injure Coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere 
<br>in the region. 
<br> 
<br>-- Turkey is also required to prevent the transfers from Iran 
<br>as noted in UNSCR 1747, paragraph 5, which prohibits Iran 
<br>from supplying, selling or transferring from its territory 
<br>any "arms or related materiel."  All states are required to 
<br>prohibit the procurement of such items from Iran by their 
<br>nationals, or using their flag vessels or aircraft; whether 
<br>or not such transfers originated in the territory of Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- We believe the arms and explosives acquisitions being 
<br>pursued by Mercan Tanitim and MKEK with Iranian entities 
<br>would clearly violate this provision of UNSCR 1747, and that 
<br>the Kolorkim and Mercan Tanitim deal involving the transfer 
<br>of nitrocellulose may as well. 
<br> 
<br>-- Action to prevent such transfers would clearly demonstrate 
<br>Turkey's commitment to the full and effective implementation 
<br>of UNSCR 1747. Such action would also remove the possibility 
<br>that these firms could be subject to U.S. sanctions under the 
<br>Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (INKSNA). 
<br> 
<br>-- We strongly urge you to investigate this information and 
<br>prevent any transfers being contemplated by the entities 
<br>involved by using authorities available under Turkish 
<br>domestic law. 
<br> 
<br>-- Please share with us the results of your investigation at 
<br>your earliest convenience.
