<br>Classified By: Ambassador E. Anthony Wayne for reasons 1.4
<br>(b)and(d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary and Comment: Argentina's President Nestor
<br>Kirchner is trying to stake out a position for himself close
<br>to Chavez yet still working well with the U.S. on issues
<br>important to Argentina. With domestic political advantage
<br>and 2007 elections in mind, we expect Kirchner to continue
<br>the balancing act. Kirchner will lash out with largely
<br>indirect criticism, he will cozy up to Chavez, and yet he
<br>will maintain a number of open doors to us. Kirchner
<br>recognizes the value of maintaining quiet, positive relations
<br>with the U.S. -- particularly on key strategic issues, e.g.
<br>non-proliferation and counterterrorism -- but sees no value
<br>domestically in aligning himself publicly with the U.S. or
<br>its policies. In fact, he gets a domestic boost from lashing
<br>out at perceived pressure and in striking an independent
<br>pose, a la Charles de Gaulle. Argentina's commercial and
<br>economic relationship with Venezuela is also of strategic
<br>importance (refs. a, b), the difference being that,
<br>domestically, Kirchner does perceive value, in particular
<br>electorally, in publicly linking himself to Chavez; he is
<br>bringing home the bacon. The meetings between senior GoA
<br>ministers and AG Gonzalez and U/S Burns and A/S Shannon were
<br>uniformly positive, recognizing an important common agenda in
<br>many areas (refs c-d and septels), and the press play from
<br>the visits was positive and profuse. In light of this
<br>dynamic, Kirchner's statements in Venezuela -- that Argentina
<br>will "not contain Venezuela" and his invitation for Chavez to
<br>visit in March are indicative of the GoA's desire to maintain
<br>what they see as a "balance" in relations with the U.S. and
<br>Venezuela. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Attorney General Gonzales' February 6-7 visit, and U/S
<br>Nick Burns and A/S Shannon's February 8-9 visit to Buenos
<br>Aires and meetings with senior Kirchner ministers served to
<br>underscore improving bilateral relations, the breadth of that
<br>relationship, as well as highlight U.S. policy priorities in
<br>the region. Kirchner insiders, Cabinet Chief Alberto
<br>Fernandez and Planning Minister Julio De Vido, confirmed to
<br>Burns and Shannon the importance of the relationship to the
<br>GoA, the strong working-level cooperation on
<br>counterterrorism, counternarcotics, and international support
<br>for non-proliferation. Together with Foreign Minister
<br>Taiana, they shared concerns about the situation in Bolivia
<br>and Ecuador, and the need for strengthening stability in the
<br>region, including through joint efforts in Haiti. They also
<br>emphasized the importance they place on attracting U.S.
<br>investment (although a negative decision made public during
<br>the visit regarding a U.S. investment fund seeking a share of
<br>a local energy transmitting company, indicates that the
<br>actual message to potential investors, at best, is mixed).
<br>Cabinet Chief Fernandez publicly characterized relations as
<br>"good" the day after Burns' visit.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Kirchner style from the beginning, however, has
<br>been combative in the face of real, imagined and fabricated
<br>challenges from sources as varied as the Catholic church,
<br>neoliberalism and the "Washington consensus," the World Bank
<br>and IMF, parasitic foreign multi-nationals, the press and
<br>political opponents (whether from within or from outside the
<br>Peronist party) and -- indirectly stated -- the the U.S.
<br>This style has stood him in good stead. As the economy
<br>boomed, buoyed by favorable external factors, his popularity
<br>ratings have soared, and have remained high, due in no small
<br>part to his pugnacious character.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Kirchner demonstrated again over the last two weeks
<br>his willingness to attack external institutions for domestic
<br>political gain. He lashed out on several occasions at the
<br>IFIs and other international organizations, rejecting their
<br>latest gentle criticisms of GoA economic policies and blaming
<br>them again for the 2001/2002 financial crisis and also for
<br>current high poverty levels. His outburst followed mildly
<br>critical comments from the World Bank and World Trade
<br>Organization officials about the sustainability of the GoA's
<br>economic policies. He was also responding to an IMF
<br>spokesman's comment to the press that an IMF agreement was
<br>normally a prerequisite for Paris Club debt rescheduling.
<br>Despite the IMF's explanation that this was a Paris Club, not
<br>IMF, requirement, Kirchner blamed the IMF -- his favorite
<br>whipping boy -- for blocking a Paris Club deal. He and his
<br>Economic Minister, Felisa Miceli, also used the opportunity
<br>to pander to the public's extreme hostility towards the IMF
<br>by rejecting categorically any possibility of a Fund program
<br>with Argentina.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) This dynamic helps explain the two faces of Kirchner
<br>we see in our bilateral relations. Kirchner is essentially
<br>pragmatic but excessively focused on domestic issues and
<br>public opinion. The low point in recent bilateral relations,
<br>occasioned by the GoA performance at the Mar del Plata Summit
<br>of the Americas in November 2005, perhaps convinced Kirchner
<br>he had gone a bit too far down the populist route. Since
<br>then, we have seen a gradual and steady improvement in
<br>relations with an increasing willingness by senior-level
<br>officials in engaging in dialogue with us and in identifying
<br>areas where we can strengthen cooperation.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) However, we do not expect to see a public embrace of
<br>the U.S. or many of our policies. The public image of the
<br>U.S. in Argentina is the lowest in the region. Kirchner's
<br>regular verbal assaults on policies and institutions linked
<br>in the public mind to the U.S., e.g. globalization and the
<br>international financial institutions, resonate very well here
<br>as long as they don't foretell a serious break (see latest
<br>INR U.S Image paper from the Oct-Nov 2006 Latinobarometro
<br>poll comparing Argentina with 17 other regional publics).
<br>Kirchner calculates -- with at least one eye always on the
<br>next election -- that there is little up-side to being linked
<br>too closely with the U.S., and little down-side to
<br>occasionally "standing firm" and "protecting the people's
<br>interests" before the hegemonic power.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The press here eggs this on, couching many issues as
<br>the ideological struggle between the U.S. and Venezuela for
<br>predominance in the region. As a reflection of this, GoA
<br>actions are either portrayed as pro-Chavez or as a
<br>rapprochement with the U.S. Contacts inform us that Kirchner
<br>also sees himself as maintaining this balance between the two
<br>-- a la Charles de Gualle between the cold war powers U.S.
<br>and USSR. The Embassy has seen on several occasions, when
<br>the press appears to be too caught up in portraying the
<br>improving U.S.- GoA relations, that Kirchner will find an
<br>opportunity to publicly stick a pin in that balloon. In the
<br>aftermath of the Gonzalez/Burns/Shannon visits, Kirchner,
<br>while in Venezuela recently to sign a number of commercial
<br>agreements, may have felt compelled to "right the balance"
<br>and demonstrate his independence with his gratuitous remark
<br>that Argentina would not "contain" Chavez (ref. A). The
<br>media here has, in fact, tied Kirchner's comments in
<br>Venezuela to Burns/Shannon remarks made here during their
<br>recent visit that the U.S. could work well with governments
<br>like Argentina and Brazil but that Venezuela was "another
<br>matter."
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Comment: It is clear we have foreign policy
<br>differences with the Kirchner administration, particularly
<br>over how we view Chavez and his actions in Venezuela and the
<br>region. Press reports here say Chavez will be paying a
<br>return visit to Kirchner next week, coinciding with President
<br>Bush's visit to Uruguay (septel - Senior GoA contacts tell us
<br>the visit is still unconfirmed). Ambassador has expressed
<br>our strong concerns that Chavez will use the occasion to
<br>organize another anti-U.S. rally (as is being reported in the
<br>press), and that such an act would negatively impact our
<br>bilateral relations. This, unfortunately, would be the type
<br>of gesture to be expected of Kirchner; one focused on
<br>short-term electoral political gain, with little thought for
<br>longer-term consequences. We should not expect significant
<br>changes in the GOA's foreign policy or GOA public statements
<br>in support of the U.S. Nor is Kirchner likely to change many
<br>of his interventionist economic tendencies. All of this is
<br>especially true in an election year. But on most of the key
<br>bilateral and multilateral issues important to the U.S., in
<br>fact, we believe we can continue to build strong cooperation
<br>in a quiet, deliberate way.
