<br>CORRUPTION 
<br>
<br>REF: 07 ABUJA 2627 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Walter Pflaumer for Reasons 1.4 (b, 
<br>c, & d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S//NF) SUMMARY: XXXXXXXXXXXX alleged a close 
<br>association between President Yar,Adua and Katsina native 
<br>and rumored smuggler Dahiru Mangal. XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed Mangal 
<br>is the President's "Mr. Fix It," taking care of "anything 
<br>filthy" Yar'Adua needs done in addition to smuggling items 
<br>for several wealthy Nigerian businessmen through Niger into 
<br>Kano. Another Kano business contact corroborated XXXXXXXXXXXX 's 
<br>allegations, but observed that Mangal no longer deals openly 
<br>in illicit activity since Yar'Adua named him a special 
<br>advisor earlier this month. As well, XXXXXXXXXXXX maintained that 
<br>he had been approached by a man claiming to represent First 
<br>Lady Turai Yar'Adua and seeking an USD 2 million pay-off. 
<br>While Post cannot independently authenticate these 
<br>allegations of corruption by the President or First Lady, 
<br>Post has heard rumors of an emergent "Katsina clique" in the 
<br>Presidential Villa. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S//NF) Kano real estate entrepreneur and longtime Mission 
<br>contact XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff February 
<br>10 that Katsina native Dahiru Mangal, who XXXXXXXXXXXX contends 
<br>deals in illicit smuggling of goods into Nigeria, is also 
<br>known as President Yar'Adua's "Mr. Fix It." XXXXXXXXXXXX alleged 
<br>a close association between the President and Mangal, dating 
<br>to the former's tenure as governor of Katsina, and claimed 
<br>the latter remains to this day Yar'Adua's "go-to man" to 
<br>accomplish "anything filthy that Yar'Adua needs done." 
<br>Mangal, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, is also the "go-to" for any wealthy 
<br>Nigerian, who wants to import "just about anything" into 
<br>Nigeria. He declined to state whether Mangal smuggled 
<br>weapons, drugs, or persons into Nigeria. (On February 17, 
<br>PolOff queried another Kano business contact, who 
<br>corroborated XXXXXXXXXXXX 's accusations, however claimed Mangal no 
<br>longer goes by "Mr. Fix It" since Yar'Adua officially named 
<br>him a special advisor earlier this month. Allegedly, 
<br>Yar'Adua instructed Mangal to cease any illicit activity if 
<br>Mangal wished to enjoy official recognition by the President. 
<br>The contact implied this may connote, inter alia, that 
<br>Yar'Adua desires to maintain at least the appearance of 
<br>respect for rule of law, and thus, does not want any of his 
<br>close advisors openly involved in suspect activity.) 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S//NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>several Nigerian businessmen who have employed Mangal's
<br>services over the past several years. Reportedly, Mangal owns a warehouse across 
<br>the Niger border (likely close to the Katsina border with 
<br>Jibiyya and Maradi) in which he stores hundreds of 40-foot 
<br>shipping containers. XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed Mangal is able to 
<br>import goods from around the world, including China. In 
<br>return, Mangal requests a flat fee of 2 million naira (USD 
<br>17,000), excluding the cost of goods. Approximately 100 
<br>containers per month are brought into Kano, and goods are 
<br>then delivered to clients or sold in Kano's Kurmi market. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S//NF) Mangal also operates several legitimate 
<br>businesses, XXXXXXXXXXXX asserted, including Mangal Airlines. The 
<br>National Hajj Commission of Nigeria contracted Kabo, 
<br>Bellview, Meridian, and Mangal Airlines for the December 2007 
<br>hajj operations, which transported approximately 100,000 
<br>Nigerians to Saudi Arabia for the annual pilgrimage. (Note: 
<br>Many Nigerian Muslims have criticized the GON's handling of 
<br>the 2007 hajj claiming several thousand Nigerians were left 
<br>stranded in Saudi Arabia and could not return to Nigeria, 
<br>except without extraordinary hardship, and several others 
<br>were never airlifted from Nigeria at all. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S//NF) Moreover, XXXXXXXXXXXX said XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX had been approached recently by a man claiming to speak on 
<br>behalf of First Lady Turai Yar'Adua. The person, who arrived 
<br>at the meeting with XXXXXXXXXXXX in a Peugeot with a 
<br>"presidential" license plate, told XXXXXXXXXXXX the First Lady 
<br>would "allow" them to construct the homes so long as she is 
<br>given an advance payment of 250 million naira (USD 2 
<br>million). XXXXXXXXXXXX said he was willing to offer the First 
<br>
<br>ABUJA 00000320 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>Lady twenty plots of land instead, to which the presumed 
<br>emissary grimaced. The negotiations, XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff, 
<br>continue. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C//NF) NOTE: During a late January conversation with 
<br>PolOff, XXXXXXXXXXXXX said XXXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>purchased an USD 10 million house in central London 
<br>approximately 7 years ago, XXXXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br>This house apparently was excluded from President 
<br>Yar,Adua,s public declaration of assets in June 2007, which 
<br>put his total wealth at approximately USD 7 million. END 
<br>NOTE. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S//NF) COMMENT: While XXXXXXXXXXXX is a trusted, longtime 
<br>Mission contact who has provided veracious information in the 
<br>past, we cannot independently confirm his statements 
<br>regarding Mangal or the First Lady. Certainly, the man who 
<br>approached XXXXXXXXXXXXX seeking a pay-off may simply have been 
<br>attempting to exploit the First Lady's name for personal 
<br>enrichment. We have heard rumors of the emergence of a 
<br>"Katsina clique" in the Villa -- a group of individuals from 
<br>the President's home state of Katsina who reportedly 
<br>constitute Yar'Adua's inner circle and increasingly, control 
<br>access to him. The surfacing of this group may be a 
<br>corrollary to Yar'Adua's lack of national exposure (and 
<br>hence, his deficiently broad support base) and his inability 
<br>thus far to stamp his authority on the ruling People's 
<br>Democratic Party. Rumors abound alleging that the First 
<br>Lady, Special Advisor Tanimu Yakubu, and Minister of 
<br>Agriculture Sayyadi Ruma are involved in corrupt practices. 
<br>Reports of both the First Lady and Yakubu's taste for the 
<br>high life and tendencies toward illicit enrichment surfaced 
<br>during a December 2007 debrief by XXXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>outlined problems he saw in the Villa and cases XXXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>was closely watching (Ref A). 
<br>Several contacts from XXXXXXXXXXXXX, moreover, maintain that while 
<br>the President "appeared incorruptible" during his tenure as 
<br>governor, his wife siphoned off millions in public funds for 
<br>private use. Post will closely monitor these accusations and 
<br>report any new developments. END COMMENT.
