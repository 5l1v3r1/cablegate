<br>SUBJECT: POLITICIAN WITH FARC CONTACTS REACHES OUT TO 
<br>EMBASSY 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor John Creamer 
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
<br> 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>¶1. (C) At the urging of National Conciliation Commission 
<br>official Father Dario Echeverri, Polcouns met with XXXXXXXXXXXX--
<br>a politician who was previously authorized by the GOC 
<br>to transmit messages to the FARC.  XXXXXXXXXXXX stressed he had no 
<br>specific message for the USG, but wanted to establish a 
<br>"relationship" with the Embassy.  He agreed conditions are 
<br>not ripe for GOC-FARC peace talks, but said FARC Secretariat 
<br>member Pablo Catatumbo believes that USG participation would 
<br>be key to any eventual peace process.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said the FARC 
<br>is trying to regain political visibility with its recent 
<br>unilateral hostage releases, and dismissed the notion that 
<br>FARC leaders Alfonso Cano and Mono Jojoy are rivals.  End 
<br>Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Polcouns met with XXXXXXXXXXXX politician XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>at the Catholic Bishops Conference facility in Bogota 
<br>on May 14.  The GOC was aware of the meeting, which was 
<br>organized and attended by National Conciliation Commission 
<br>Secretary-General Father Dario Echeverri.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said FARC 
<br>Secretariat member Jorge Torres Victoria (Pablo Catatumbo), 
<br>his primary FARC contact, had encouraged him to establish 
<br>contact with the Embassy.  XXXXXXXXXXXX stressed that he did not 
<br>bring a message from the FARC for the USG, but said he wanted 
<br>to establish a "relationship" with the Embassy that could 
<br>prove useful in the future.  He said Catatumbo is convinced 
<br>that USG participation in any eventual peace process with the 
<br>GOC would be key to success.  XXXXXXXXXXXX was authorized by the 
<br>GOC to transmit messages to the FARC from July 2008 until 
<br>March 2009. 
<br> 
<br>FARC PLAYING POLITICS WITH HOSTAGES 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said there is nothing humanitarian about the 
<br>FARC's recent hostage releases.  The FARC released the 
<br>hostages to regain some political visibility and relieve 
<br>itself of the economic and security costs incurred in holding 
<br>them.  Several FARC commanders have openly complained to 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX that the hostages are a growing burden due to 
<br>Colombian military pressure.  He said the FARC Secretariat 
<br>realizes that Uribe will never agree to a humanitarian 
<br>accord, but wants to continue with the releases to maximize 
<br>the political impact.  Still, he felt the FARC will not free 
<br>any more hostages unilaterally unless Uribe reverses his 
<br>current stance and allows Senator Piedad Cordoba to 
<br>participate. 
<br> 
<br>TIME NOT RIPE FOR PEACE TALKS 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXX said conditions are not ripe for GOC-FARC talks 
<br>aimed at starting peace negotiations due to the on-going 
<br>presidential election campaign and the deep distrust on both 
<br>sides.  Still, he said that at an appropriate moment in the 
<br>future, a gesture from the USG to the FARC, such as allowing 
<br>a representative of a U.S. non-governmental organization to 
<br>accompany a meeting between the GOC and the FARC, could 
<br>provide an impetus to start talks. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXX said he worked with then Peace Commissioner 
<br>Luis Carlos Restrepo in early 2008 to develop and implement 
<br>projects targeting the rural (campesino) population in Valle 
<br>de Cauca, with FARC knowledge and consent.  He noted that 
<br>Catatumbo had even facilitated some of the GOC's meetings 
<br>with campesino leaders.  XXXXXXXXXXXX also claimed he worked to 
<br>develop a similar project in southern Tolima, but said the 
<br>effort stalled due to opposition from then Defense Minister 
<br>Juan Manuel Santos, who argued that the project was "merely 
<br>feeding the guerrillas."  In contrast, Restrepo believed that 
<br>working with the campesinos was a way for the GOC to build 
<br>confidence and establish contact with the FARC. 
<br> 
<br>FARC LEADERSHIP NOT DIVIDED 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>¶6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX dismissed the notion that FARC Secretariat 
<br>leaders Guillermo Saenz (Alfonso Cano) and Jorge Briceno 
<br> 
<br>(Mono Jojoy) are rivals, claiming that Jojoy, Cano and 
<br>Catatumbo are good friends.  XXXXXXXXXXXX observed that Jojoy lacks 
<br>Cano's and Catatumbo's educational background, but said Jojoy 
<br>understands that the FARC's struggle is political, not 
<br>military.  XXXXXXXXXXX said all three FARC leaders wanted to drop 
<br>the FARC's demand for a demilitarized zone as a condition for 
<br>a humanitarian exchange long before Operation Check (Jaque), 
<br>but then FARC leader Marulanda had refused. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said Jojoy accepts Cano's leadership and 
<br>supports his effort to develop a more active political 
<br>strategy.  He added that while Cano originally was perceived 
<br>by rank-and-file FARC as an intellectual rather than a 
<br>fighter, his ability to survive constant Colombian military 
<br>pressure over the last year has begun to enhance his image 
<br>among FARC fighters.
