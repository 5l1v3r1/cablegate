<br>SUBJECT: POLITICAL STRATEGIES DEVELOP FOR MARCH GENERAL

<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Hugo Llorens for reasons 1.4 (b)
<br>and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: As we head into the holidays, the polls
<br>continue to suggest a close race in the March general
<br>election, with President Zapatero and the Partido Socialista
<br>Obrero Espanol (PSOE) perhaps enjoying a slight lead over
<br>Mariano Rajoy and the Partido Popular (PP). Recent
<br>conversations with key figures in the leading parties suggest
<br>that when the campaign kicks into high gear in January, both
<br>parties will be emphasizing the economy (with sharply
<br>different views on how it fares). The PSOE will trumpet
<br>itself as the party of social tolerance and environmental
<br>protection. The PP will argue that Zapatero has given too
<br>much ground to regional interests at the expense of Spanish
<br>national unity, has been weak in dealing with ETA, and has
<br>not adequately addressed the immigration issue. We do not
<br>expect foreign policy to be a key issue, although the PSOE
<br>will remind socialist voters that a return of the PP could
<br>mean a return to the pro-U.S. foreign policy of former PP
<br>President Aznar. Both parties think turnout levels will be
<br>the determining factor, since PP voters are widely believed
<br>to be more disciplined and hence could be over-represented if
<br>relatively few people vote on election day. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>
<br>PSOE SECRETARY GENERAL CONFIDENT BUT HOLDING HIS CARDS CLOSE
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Pepe Blanco, Secretary General of the PSOE, acts as
<br>the de-facto party chairman and as the senior political
<br>advisor to Zapatero. Talking to the Ambassador, he compared
<br>this election to a heavy-weight title bout, and claimed the
<br>PP was not really in the fight. Blanco said he had assembled
<br>the finest polling team ever to work in Spanish politics.
<br>Boasting of his team's technical expertise, Blanco said they
<br>had conducted extensive focus group sessions all over Spain
<br>and would develop specific policy positions to reflect the
<br>interests of the voting public. Blanco confidentially
<br>expressed his certainty that the PSOE had the clear advantage
<br>in the campaign, citing weekly polls consistently in favor of
<br>Zapatero, and estimated a winning margin of 6-7 points over
<br>Rajoy based on current data. Blanco also said the polls were
<br>trending upwards over the last several weeks.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Acknowledging that PSOE-inclined voters tend to be
<br>more complacent than PP voters, Blanco said he would never
<br>make public any data showing Zapatero held a comfortable
<br>lead. Blanco's strategy and tactics hinge on convincing the
<br>PSOE voters that their vote is critical to prevent the PP
<br>from regaining the Presidency. The message will be, as
<br>Blanco framed it bluntly, "vote for the PSOE or live under
<br>the rule of reactionary Neanderthals." He also admitted
<br>Zapatero is already seen as too moderate by some PSOE
<br>"left-leaners" and they might be disinclined to cast a vote
<br>in his favor. Only by keeping the PSOE voters feeling
<br>threatened with the possibility of a PP victory could the
<br>strategists ensure that people will turn up at the polls on
<br>voting day.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Blanco noted that if PSOE does win the election, it
<br>will bring a major turnover in the PP structure as Rajoy will
<br>be forced to turn over the reins to another political figure.
<br>Blanco and other officials like Elena Valenciano, PSOE
<br>Secretary for Foreign Affairs, are counting on Zapatero's
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>voter appeal and what they describe as Rajoy's "wooden"
<br>campaign style.
<br>
<br>PP FOCUS ON ECONOMY, FAMILY
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) In a December 4 meeting with Ana Pastor, a close
<br>advisor to Rajoy, the Ambassador learned that the PP campaign
<br>team was reassessing its strategy and implementing
<br>recommendations from U.S. political consultants. In a moment
<br>of candor, Pastor said that the PP assumed previously that
<br>Spanish voters recognized implicitly Rajoy's intellect and
<br>capacity, saying, "Rajoy would be a better President than he
<br>is a candidate." PP consultants advised that voters
<br>perceived Rajoy as distant and unsympathetic. The PP team
<br>intends to create opportunities for Rajoy to show more
<br>empathy and human connection with voters. They will
<br>emphasize the importance of the family with linkages to
<br>health, education, financial independence and security. The
<br>PP will also continue to focus on pocketbook issues such as
<br>rising interest rates (home ownership -- vice renting -- and
<br>variable rate mortgages are the norm here) and inflation.
<br>Pastor will work with Rajoy to put in place a credible
<br>finance team that can compete with the success of current
<br>Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes and articulate a strong
<br>
<br>MADRID 00002265 002 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>financial stability message to the electorate.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Pastor, like other PP interlocutors, criticized the
<br>PSOE for diminishing Spain's international prestige during
<br>the last three years. According to Pastor, Zapatero
<br>abandoned the transatlantic relationship and reduced Spain's
<br>international influence. The PP would seek to expand Spain's
<br>prestige and reaffirm key alliances. Citing missed
<br>opportunities and mishandling of important portfolios such as
<br>the Middle East, North Africa, Venezuela and Cuba, Pastor
<br>admitted that foreign policy might not be a decisive issue in
<br>the March elections. Nevertheless, she argued that increased
<br>drug trafficking from Latin America (e.g., Venezuela) and
<br>rising consumption in Spain could give the PP a way to tie
<br>the PSOE's foreign policy blunders to the concerns of
<br>ordinary voters.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Acknowledging that all politics are local and that the
<br>election would be won or lost on "hometown issues," Pastor
<br>said that the "human connection" strategy would play a big
<br>part in regional politics. Andalucia is a primary target for
<br>getting out the vote, and the PP will play up the need for
<br>more education and training opportunities (local press noted
<br>Andalucia was ranked lower than Turkey in a recent education
<br>survey). In Catalonia, the PP hopes a series of
<br>well-publicized debacles involving public infrastructure
<br>(commuter train interruptions and electricity blackouts) will
<br>lead Catalan voters (who are unlikely to vote for the PP in
<br>any circumstance) to stay home on election day.
<br>
<br>PP SEEKS TO UP THE LEVEL OF CHARISMA
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) During a lunch hosted by the DCM with five members of
<br>the PP electoral committee, the guests recognized Rajoy was
<br>behind in the polls but claimed to take comfort from the fact
<br>that the polls failed to predict their strong showing in
<br>Spain's May 2005 municipal elections. The advisors theorized
<br>the campaign would be fought hardest in about 20 cities where
<br>congressional seats are won or lost by a handful of votes.
<br>Each party will put its most charismatic candidates on the
<br>ballots in these key areas (e.g., Valencia). The PP team
<br>said their campaign would focus on a softening economy,
<br>Zapatero's alleged weakness in the face of Basque and Catalan
<br>demands for more autonomy and fiscal privileges, and rising
<br>concerns over immigration.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) If PP did win the election, Ignacio Astarloa, PP
<br>Executive Secretary for Security and Justice, has been
<br>mentioned to us as the potential Minister of Interior (among
<br>others by Astarloa himself) and Angel Acebes, PP General
<br>Secretary has been mentioned as Vice President and senior
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>policy advisor. There has been hedging about who might be
<br>Minister of Foreign Affairs, with a hint that that PP
<br>insiders such as Jorge Moragas or Gustavo Aristegui might be
<br>passed over in favor of a senior career diplomat.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Astarloa told us he expects the March election to be
<br>close (within two to three percent). He declined to
<br>speculate as to which party was ahead at this point, but he
<br>admitted what many observers have noted: the PP might have
<br>overplayed its hand during the last eighteen months with its
<br>harsh criticism of the PSOE for being soft on terrorism.
<br>Nevertheless, he believed Rajoy had much more credibility
<br>than Zapatero on security issues, and that, combined with
<br>effective messages on the economy and immigration, could win
<br>the day. Like Pastor, he emphasized framing issues in a way
<br>that connected with voters and cited immigration as one such
<br>issue. He noted the rising number of immigrants was
<br>beginning to affect ordinary Spaniards as they sought access
<br>to social services such as health and education. He also
<br>believed immigration could be linked to law and order
<br>concerns such as gang violence.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) While the general sense seems to be that the PSOE is
<br>slightly ahead, it is too early to make predictions. Rajoy
<br>has so far failed to land any body blows on Zapatero.
<br>Instead, the PSOE has had some success (thanks in part to PP
<br>missteps) in depicting the PP as mean-spirited and needlessly
<br>divisive. Nevertheless, Spanish voters will not get serious
<br>about this campaign until January or even February. Rajoy
<br>still has time to get his message across (it appears there
<br>will be two televised debates). There is also the very real
<br>possibility that the softening economy, especially if
<br>unemployment jumps, will spook the voters. Finally, a boring
<br>or negative campaign could suppress turnout, which everyone
<br>seems to believe could hand the PP a victory.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) A lurking issue for the PP is that even if it beats
<br>the PSOE, it may not win enough seats to govern without
<br>forming alliances with other parties. There are 350 seats in
<br>Congress, and 176 are required to govern. In 2004, the PSOE
<br>won 164, the PP 148, CiU (the main Catalan party) ten, ERC
<br>(another Catalan party) eight, the PNV (the main Basque
<br>party) seven, the IU (far left) five, and smaller parties a
<br>total of eight. The PSOE combined with ERC and IU to add 13
<br>to their total of 164. The PP electoral committee has
<br>acknowledged to us they might have to seek alliances with the
<br>Catalan or Basque parties to govern, but it is far from
<br>certain that parties from the same regions the PP criticizes
<br>for demanding too much autonomy from the central government
<br>will ally themselves with the PP if the time comes.
<br>Certainly they would try to exact a heavy price.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Finally, there is the unexpected. The terrorist
<br>attacks three days before the 2004 election probably cost the
<br>PP the presidency (certainly that is what the PP believes).
<br>With the polls so close, no one can rule out some unforeseen
<br>event that would turn the campaigns upside down. Whatever
<br>the case, we will be watching closely.
