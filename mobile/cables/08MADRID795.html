<br>
<br>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Hugo Llorens, for reasons 1.4 (b
<br>) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The DCM paid a farewell call on Spanish
<br>Secretary of State for IberoAmerican Affairs Trinidad Jimenez
<br>on July 1 and took the opportunity to exchange views on
<br>recent events in the Western Hemisphere. The meeting was
<br>substantive and lasted well over an hour. The two discussed
<br>FM Moratinos's June 17-18 visit to Colombia and Venezuela and
<br>Jimenez's trip to Ecuador, ongoing protests in Argentina,
<br>opportunities for the United States and Spain to collaborate
<br>with Mexico and Central American countries on security
<br>issues, and Cuba. As usual, Jimenez was cordial and open,
<br>and although aware of the challenges facing Latin America,
<br>was overall optimistic about the medium-term prospects in the
<br>region. Reviewing our shared goals, both Secretary of State
<br>Jimenez and the DCM were hopeful for future opportunities for
<br>U.S.-Spanish engagement in the region, including the next
<br>Working Group which Jimenez hoped would take place in
<br>September on the margins of the UNGA. End summary.
<br>
<br>//The Merida Initiative//
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The DCM opened by stressing the importance of the
<br>United States and Spain working together to support democracy
<br>by seeking ways to strengthen the rule of law and promote
<br>judicial reform in Latin America. The DCM cited Foreign
<br>Affairs Secretary of State Angel Lossada's June 26 meetings
<br>in Washington with the Deputy Secretary and with WHA A/S
<br>Shannon. Jimenez said Lossada had briefed her on these
<br>meetings. She agreed that judicial reform and rule of law
<br>were vital issues in the region and had a prominent place in
<br>EU and Spanish development portfolios in Latin American
<br>countries. She stressed Spain's continuing future resource
<br>commitment in this area and promised to provide us with a
<br>portfolio of these kinds of projects throughout the region.
<br>In response to the DCM's brief, she was extremely positive
<br>about the U.S. effort to further increase support for Mexican
<br>and Central American efforts to fight drug trafficking and
<br>organized crime through the Merida Initiative. She cited the
<br>critical importance for the region of President Calderon's
<br>success in his tenacious fight against the drug bands.
<br>Jimenez expressed great concern about the deteriorating
<br>situation in Central America and agreed that making headway
<br>against corruption and crime were critical to restoring
<br>stability in the region.
<br>
<br>//Recovering "Formality" with Venezuela, et al//
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Asked about Foreign Minister Moratinos's June trip to
<br>Venezuela and Colombia, Jimenez responded that Spain's
<br>purpose had been to "recover a certain formality" and to
<br>diminish tensions before the next IberoAmerican Summit, in
<br>which the Spanish King will participate. Jimenez said that
<br>in this visit Chavez had been unusually moderate, avoiding
<br>rhetorical excesses, and expressing interest in normalizing
<br>relations with Spain. She described the principal issues on
<br>the agenda as bilateral and principally related to supporting
<br>Spanish business interests and ensuring the protection of
<br>Spanish citizen properties in Venezuela. Jimenez described
<br>Chavez as "a brute, but not a stupid one." Chavez recognized
<br>that having lost the December 2007 referendum, his leadership
<br>position had been weakened. She said that Moratinos had
<br>invited Chavez to Spain, in connection with a trip by Chavez
<br>to the Water Expo in Zaragoza, in an effort to smooth over
<br>relations between the King and Chavez -- an effort the King
<br>supported. (Embassy Comment: We understand that Chavez is
<br>scheduled to visit Spain on/about July 21. The media report
<br>he will meet with King Juan Carlos I on July 25 in Palma de
<br>Mallorca, and will come to Madrid the same day to meet with
<br>President Zapatero.) The DCM raised U.S. concerns about
<br>Chavez and particularly his growing ties with Iran. Jimenez
<br>agreed that Venezuela's relations with Iran needed to be
<br>monitored, but noted that ultimately the two countries did
<br>not have much in common because of culture and the fact that
<br>both were principally energy exporters. She hastened
<br>somewhat naively to point out that despite economic dealings
<br>with Iran, Venezuela's economic ties with the U.S. would
<br>remain paramount. The DCM stressed the importance of Spain's
<br>not selling arms or weapons systems to Venezuela, which would
<br>send destabilizing signals around the region.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Regarding the state of relations between Venezuela,
<br>Colombia, and Ecuador since the early March border conflict,
<br>Jimenez stated that despite the huge political differences
<br>between Chavez and Uribe, paradoxically in the past both
<br>Presidents actually had developed a measure of personal
<br>rapport. Certainly, national interest suggested that both
<br>nations needed to maintain good relations. She cited the
<br>fact that Venezuela was very dependent on Colombia as its
<br>principal supplier of foodstuffs, a fact that Chavez appeared
<br>mindful of at a time that Venezuela faced severe food
<br>shortages. Jimenez insisted that Uribe had even managed to
<br>maintain open lines of communication with Cuba's Fidel
<br>Castro, developed over the years and related to peace talks
<br>with the ELN. The biggest problem in this diplomatic jigsaw,
<br>according to Jimenez, was the poor state of relations between
<br>Ecuador and Colombia, and personally between President Correa
<br>and President Uribe. Jimenez described as excellent Foreign
<br>Minister Moratinos, visit to Colombia and meetings with
<br>President Uribe in Cali. Jimenez mentioned that Spain had
<br>offered to be helpful in easing tensions over the border with
<br>Ecuador, and had offered to provide a radar in order to
<br>ensure better border communication between the two countries.
<br>In her visit to Quito, Jimenez said Ecuadorian President
<br>seemed most concerned about salvaging his international image
<br>damaged by evidence linking him and his government to the
<br>FARC.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Jimenez asserted President Zapatero was keen on
<br>strengthening ties with the troubled Andean region. Of the
<br>Andean nations, Bolivia was the most worrisome for Spain.
<br>She did not see Bolivia breaking up, but did see the
<br>potential for violence between the regions as a real
<br>possibility. While President Evo Morales might be
<br>strengthened by any referendum, it seemed to Jimenez that
<br>Morales had "thrown in the towel" and was no longer fighting
<br>the prefects. She noted that Morales appeared to be looking
<br>for external enemies such as USAID to detract from his
<br>domestic problems. Overall, however, Spain and Europe had
<br>reason to be optimistic as things were "settling" throughout
<br>Latin America. Young democracies that had not yet performed
<br>well needed time to consolidate their maturing democracies,
<br>yet Jimenez judged there was a low risk of back-sliding in
<br>most countries of the region. Jimenez and the DCM agreed
<br>that the recent mob attack on the U.S. Embassy was of grave
<br>concern and seriously weakened the credibility of the
<br>Bolivian government to guarantee the security of diplomatic
<br>missions.
<br>
<br>//Argentina//
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Regarding Argentina, Jimenez said President Cristina
<br>Kirchner had canceled a planned July 14 visit to Spain due to
<br>the conflict with the farmers. Jimenez agreed that Argentina
<br>had once again lost an opportunity to move its economy
<br>forward. She called Kirchner's response to the ongoing farm
<br>protests a shame for such a great and resource-rich country
<br>and said she hoped that there would be a viable and organized
<br>opposition. She lamented the weakness of Argentine political
<br>parties and noted she was troubled by the "unionized"
<br>opposition mounted in the countryside by the farmers, which
<br>she said threatened chaos. Jimenez opined that part of the
<br>problem was Cristina's over-reliance on former President
<br>Nestor Kirchner, whose confrontational approach to politics
<br>was exacerbating the crisis.
<br>
<br>//Cuba//
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Turning to Cuba, Jimenez expressed hope the EU's
<br>strategy would be successful and would generate positive
<br>change. The DCM voiced the Administration's skepticism that
<br>these measures would generate positive response from Raul
<br>Castro. Jimenez expressed the hope that if real change were
<br>evident, Washington might be able to adjust its own approach.
<br>The DCM assured her that if Cuba embarked on a genuine path
<br>of political reform, the U.S. was ready and had a plan to
<br>engage and provide support. Jimenez echoed opinions heard
<br>previously in our past discussions on Cuba, insisting that
<br>the international community could not merely wait for change
<br>but must talk to the regime and push directly in order for
<br>changes to come. The DCM said the USG was pleased that a
<br>
<br>wide spectrum of EU countries had participated in the June
<br>review process and that the declaration was cautious,
<br>mentioned prisoners of conscience, and included at a minimum
<br>the one-year evaluation mechanism.
<br>
<br>//Latin American Working Group//
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Jimenez expressed hope that Spain would further
<br>strengthen its relationship with the United States so that in
<br>a global scenario, the whole Western Hemisphere will become
<br>one pole: (just) America. She noted that in all of her
<br>meetings with Latin American leaders, she stressed the
<br>importance of having strong relations with the U.S. as
<br>essential to maintaining hemispheric cohesion, which was good
<br>for the region and in Spain,s interest. Jimenez said her
<br>office would continue to work with WHA A/S Shannon to bridge
<br>the gap in our perspectives through the end of the Bush
<br>Administration. She told the DCM she looked forward to going
<br>to Washington in September in conjunction with her travel to
<br>New York for the UN General Assembly. Jimenez planned to
<br>spend the first few days with President Zapatero at the UN
<br>and return for the LAWG at the end of the week, but saw no
<br>need to stay in New York for bilateral meetings with Western
<br>Hemisphere leaders who frequently come to see her in Spain.
<br>Asked by the DCM if she would still be interested in visiting
<br>Southern Command in Miami, she demurred vaguely saying that
<br>"they" would think it wrong. She said it was important
<br>nonetheless to maintain contact with the Cuban community in
<br>Miami and to have a presence -- even if her interlocutors
<br>were critical of Spanish policy. Jimenez and the DCM agreed
<br>that both Spain and the United States had common political
<br>and economic interests in Latin America and needed to
<br>continue to work closely together. The DCM noted that A/S
<br>Shannon's numerous visits to Europe demonstrated our interest
<br>in working closely with Europe on Latin America.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) COMMENT: Jimenez appeared increasingly confident in
<br>her role as Spain,s senior policymaker on Latin America and
<br>will remain our principal interlocutor in the region. It
<br>will be important to continue to work with her and influence
<br>her on issues of mutual interest.
