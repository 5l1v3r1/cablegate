<br>SUBJECT: (S/NF) PROGRESS ON US-ROYG COOPERATION TO REDUCE
<br>MANPADS THREAT
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Stephen Seche for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY.  On June 20-22, a PM/WRA delegation
<br>visited Yemen to discuss MANPADS threat reduction efforts
<br>with ROYG officials.  Since 2004, US-ROYG cooperation has
<br>dramatically reduced the availability of MANPADS on the black
<br>market in Yemen. Although the program has likely recovered
<br>the bulk of the illicit MANPADS available on the black
<br>market, several more will likely be collected in the coming
<br>years.  MOD insists that there are no official MANPADS
<br>stocks, and that they have already implemented necessary
<br>stockpile security and inventory controls, but the
<br>intelligence community and the National Security Bureau (NSB)
<br>believe that is not the case.  The USG will offer the MOD,
<br>through NSB interlocutors, payment for destruction of MOD
<br>MANPADS and stockpile security upgrades.  ROYG officials seem
<br>more receptive to a TSA-sponsored MANPADS Assist Visit.  END
<br>SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>BACKGROUND
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) After years of uncontrolled weapons imports and the
<br>chaos of the 1994 civil war, MANPADS were widely available on
<br>the illicit arms market in Yemen, making these systems a
<br>critical proliferation threat.  MANPADS that leaked from
<br>official Yemeni stocks were used in al-Qaeda (AQ) operations
<br>in Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen in 2001 and 2002.  In 2003,
<br>the ROYG began collecting MANPADS from weapons souks
<br>throughout the country, and in 2004 the USG agreed to
<br>compensate the ROYG for the acquisition and destruction of
<br>these and other black market MANPADS.  In February 2005,
<br>US-ROYG cooperation resulted in the destruction of 1,161
<br>MANPADS.
<br>
<br>MEETINGS READOUT
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) On June 20-22, a PM/WRA delegation consisting of
<br>Dennis Hadrick, PM/WRA Program Manager; Santo Polizzi, DHS
<br>liaison; Nils Talbot, PM/WRA technical expert; and Laurie
<br>Freeman, PM/WRA Foreign Affairs Officer, visited Yemen to
<br>discuss US-ROYG cooperation to reduce the threat of MANPADS.
<br>The delegation began with a June 20 meeting at the NSB with
<br>Col. Hefed Al-Jamrah, the NSB official in charge of airport
<br>security in Sana'a.  Polizzi briefed Jamrah on the MANPADS
<br>threat to civilian aviation.  He also offered a MANPADS
<br>Assist Visit (MAV), in which experts from the Transportation
<br>Security Administration (TSA) identify airport
<br>vulnerabilities to MANPADS attacks and recommend ways to
<br>mitigate them.  Following the meeting, the delegation toured
<br>the current airport and the site of the new airport.  During
<br>the tour, several lapses in airport security practices were
<br>observed regarding passenger screening, cargo security, and
<br>Secure Identification Display Area (SIDA) badge and access
<br>procedures.  Polizzi recommended that the TSA Representative
<br>(TSAR) in Amman, Jordan be contacted for follow-on
<br>discussions with airport officials.  NSB officials seemed
<br>receptive to the MAV offer.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) On June 21, the delegation met with NSB Deputy
<br>Director Ammar Saleh to discuss ongoing efforts to acquire
<br>MANPADS from the black market in Yemen.  Since the program's
<br>inception in August 2004, this program had resulted in the
<br>destruction of 1,161 black market MANPADS in 2005.  Hadrick
<br>thanked the ROYG for its efforts, expressed the USG's
<br>continued interest in supporting the program, and pressed the
<br>ROYG to destroy an additional 102 MANPADS they had collected
<br>since 2005.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Ammar Saleh agreed with USG assessments that the
<br>majority of black market MANPADS had been collected in Yemen,
<br>and said that a few more might trickle in with the increase
<br>in price.  (Note: In July 2008, the price for first
<br>generation systems was increased from $7,700 to $15,000. End
<br>Note.)  The small quantity of illicit MANPADS that still
<br>exist outside of state control in Yemen are in the hands of
<br>tribal leaders or AQAP, neither of which is likely to part
<br>with them at any price.  He could not estimate how many
<br>MANPADS Yemeni tribal leaders possess, but he believes that
<br>AQAP has six MANPADS (NFI).  Finally, he expressed skepticism
<br>that the MOD would accept U.S. assistance to destroy its
<br>
<br>official MANPADS stocks (an offer on the table since 2005).
<br>He believes MOD would want a more modern air defense system
<br>in return, not cash payment or stockpile security upgrades.
<br>He offered to attempt to broker a cash-for-destruction deal.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Accompanied by NSB official Akram al-Qassmi, the
<br>delegation visited a warehouse to view 96 MANPADS collected
<br>between 2005 and May 2009 that were awaiting destruction.
<br>(Note: These systems had already been verified by U.S.
<br>personnel and disabled. End Note.)  The delegation verified
<br>an additional six SA-7s, four SA-7 gripstocks, and six
<br>batteries collected by the NSB since May 2009.  The
<br>delegation disabled the six MANPADS and expended the six
<br>batteries.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) On their last day, June 22, the delegation
<br>accompanied the Ambassador to a meeting with Minister of
<br>Defense Mohammed Nasser Ahmed.  Ahmed denied that the MOD has
<br>any MANPADS in its official stocks, saying that they had
<br>already been handed over to NSB and destroyed.  (Note: This
<br>is in direct contradiction to NSB,s June 21 assertion that
<br>the MOD had excess stocks of MANPADS, but would part with
<br>them only in exchange for a more modern air defense system.
<br>End Note.) The Minister described the MOD's progress on SA/LW
<br>issues since S/E Bloomfield's July 2008 visit.  He noted that
<br>more than 250 weapons souks had been closed and more than 140
<br>weapons dealers prosecuted.  Furthermore, he remarked that
<br>the MOD has established an inventory system for all Armed
<br>Forces and MOD weapons, all of which are now marked.  He
<br>invited U.S. officials to visit the warehouses to see how the
<br>system works.  Finally, the Minister shared the delegation,s
<br>concerns about the airport,s MANPADS vulnerability, and said
<br>that as a member of the Supreme Security Committee, he would
<br>support a MAV.
<br>
<br>NEXT STEPS
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Post worked with NSB to ensure that all 102
<br>collected MANPADS were destroyed on July 27 (septel).  Post
<br>has requested a meeting with the MOD Chief of Staff to
<br>observe the stockpile security and inventory control system
<br>reportedly in place.  Post will follow up with NSB to find
<br>out whether it will accept a MAV and, if so, identify
<br>possible dates for the assessment.  (Note: Despite
<br>ministerial-level support, the final decision on the MAV will
<br>be made by President Saleh.  End Note.)  Finally, Post will
<br>work with the Department to present a specific offer to the
<br>Yemeni government for assistance with physical security and
<br>stockpile management (PSSM) and destruction and marking of
<br>Yemeni SA/LW.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) It is hard to know what to believe regarding the
<br>presence or absence of MOD MANPADS.  In a subsequent meeting
<br>on June 27, XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOffs that the MOD does indeed have
<br>MANPADS, but would never speak of them because they are
<br>considered a state secret.  While MOD realizes their MANPADS
<br>are of little military value, they consider them better than
<br>nothing and would turn them over for destruction only if they
<br>were able to get a modern air defense system in return,
<br>according to XXXXXXXXXXXX.  PolOffs agreed to continue negotiating
<br>the destruction of MOD MANPADS through NSB interlocutors,
<br>since the MOD appears unwilling to discuss the issue with USG
<br>officials directly.  END COMMENT.
