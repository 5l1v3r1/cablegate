<br>Classified By: PolMinCouns Scott Bellard, reasons, 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1.  (S/NF) Summary.  Canadian Security Intelligence Service
<br>(CSIS) Director Judd discussed domestic and foreign terror
<br>threats with Counselor of the State Department Cohen in
<br>Ottawa on July 2.  Judd admitted that CSIS was increasingly
<br>distracted from its mission by legal challenges that could
<br>endanger foreign intelligence-sharing with Canadian agencies.
<br>He predicted that the upcoming release of a DVD of
<br>Guantanamo detainee and Canadian citizen Omar Khadr's
<br>interrogation by Canadian officials would lead to heightened
<br>pressure on the government to press for his return to Canada,
<br>which the government would continue to resist.  Judd shared
<br>Dr. Cohen's negative assessment of current political,
<br>economic, and security trends in Pakistan, and was worried
<br>about what it would mean for the ISAF mission in Afghanistan.
<br>Canada has begun formulating an inter-agency Pakistan
<br>strategy, and CSIS had agreed to open a channel to Iran's
<br>intelligence service which Judd has not yet "figured out."
<br>(Septel will cover Dr. Cohen's discussions regarding Pakistan
<br>and the OEF and ISAF missions in Afghanistan.) End summary.
<br>
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) Counselor of the Department of State Eliot Cohen
<br>and CSIS Director Jim Judd in Ottawa on July 2 discussed
<br>threats posed by violent Islamist groups in Canada, and
<br>recent developments in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  (CSIS is
<br>Canada's lead agency for national security intelligence.)
<br>Director Judd ascribed an "Alice in Wonderland" worldview to
<br>Canadians and their courts, whose judges have tied CSIS "in
<br>knots," making it ever more difficult to detect and prevent
<br>terror attacks in Canada and abroad.  The situation, he
<br>commented, left government security agencies on the defensive
<br>and losing public support for their effort to protect Canada
<br>and its allies.
<br>
<br>Legal Wrangling Risks Chill Effect
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3.  (S/NF) Responding to Dr. Cohen's query, Judd said CSIS
<br>had responded to recent, non-specific intelligence on
<br>possible terror operations by "vigorously harassing" known
<br>Hezbollah members in Canada.  According to Judd, CSIS'
<br>current assessment is that no attack is "in the offing" in
<br>Canada.  He noted, however, that Hezbollah members, and their
<br>lawyers, were considering new avenues of litigation resulting
<br>from recent court rulings that, Judd complained, had
<br>inappropriately treated intelligence agencies like law
<br>enforcement bodies (refs A and C).  The Director observed
<br>that CSIS was "sinking deeper and deeper into judicial
<br>processes," making Legal Affairs the fastest growing division
<br>of his organization.  Indeed, he added, legal challenges were
<br>becoming a "distraction" that could have a major "chill
<br>effect" on intelligence officials.
<br>
<br>¶4.  (S/NF) Judd derided recent judgments in Canada's courts
<br>that threaten to undermine foreign government intelligence-
<br>Qthat threaten to undermine foreign government intelligence-
<br>and information-sharing with Canada.  These judgments posit
<br>that Canadian authorities cannot use information that "may
<br>have been" derived from torture, and that any Canadian public
<br>official who conveys such information may be subject to
<br>criminal prosecution.  This, he commented, put the government
<br>in a reverse-onus situation whereby it would have to "prove"
<br>the innocence of partner nations in the face of assumed
<br>wrongdoing.
<br>
<br>¶5.  (S/NF) Judd credited Prime Minister Stephen Harper's
<br>minority Conservative government for "taking it on the chin
<br>and pressing ahead" with common sense measures despite court
<br>challenges and political knocks from the opposition and
<br>interest groups.  When asked to look to the future, Judd
<br>predicted that Canada would soon implement UK-like legal
<br>procedures that make intelligence available to "vetted
<br>defense lawyers who see everything the judge sees."

<br>
<br>Terror Cases and Communities Present Mixed Pictures
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>
<br>¶6.  (C/NF) Judd commented that cherry-picked sections of the
<br>court-ordered release of a DVD of Guantanamo detainee and
<br>Canadian citizen Omar Khadr (ref D) would likely show three
<br>(Canadian) adults interrogating a kid who breaks down in
<br>tears.  He observed that the images would no doubt trigger
<br>"knee-jerk anti-Americanism" and "paroxysms of moral outrage,
<br>a Canadian specialty," as well as lead to a new round of
<br>heightened pressure on the government to press for Khadr's
<br>return to Canada.  He predicted that PM Harper's government
<br>would nonetheless continue to resist this pressure.
<br>¶7.  (C) The Director mentioned other major cases that also
<br>presented CSIS with major legal headaches due to the use of
<br>intelligence products in their development: Momin Khawaja has
<br>been on trial for his role in an Al Qaeda UK bomb plot since
<br>June 23 in the first major test of Canada's 2001
<br>Anti-Terrorism Act, and Canada's ability to protect
<br>intelligence supplied by foreign government sources (ref D);
<br>the trial of the first of the home-grown Toronto 11 (down
<br>from 18) terror plotters, which is also now underway; and,
<br>the prosecution of Global Islamic Media Front propagandist
<br>Said Namouh, who was arrested in Quebec in 2007 for
<br>conspiring to conduct bombings in Austria and Germany.
<br>
<br>¶8.  (C) Judd said he viewed Khawaja and his "ilk" as
<br>outliers, due in part to the fact that Canada's ethnic
<br>Pakistani community is unlike its ghettoized and poorly
<br>educated UK counterpart.  It is largely made up of traders,
<br>lawyers, doctors, engineers, and others who see promise for
<br>themselves and their children in North America, he observed,
<br>so its members are unlikely to engage in domestic terror
<br>plots.  He said that therefore CSIS main domestic focus is
<br>instead on fundraising and procurement, as well as the
<br>recruitment of a small number of Canadian "wannabes" of
<br>Pakistani origin for mostly overseas operations.
<br>
<br>Pakistan and Afghanistan
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9.  (C) Turning to Pakistan, Counselor Cohen briefed his
<br>recent trip to Islamabad and Peshawar, noting his alarm at
<br>the degrading economic, political, and security situation
<br>there, and its implications for Pakistan, Afghan, and
<br>regional stability.  Judd responded that Dr. Cohen's sober
<br>assessment tracked with CSIS' own view of Pakistan, and that
<br>"it is hard to see a good outcome there" due to that
<br>country's political, economic, and security failures, on top
<br>of fast-rising oil and food prices.  Canada does not have an
<br>explicit strategy for Pakistan, Judd said, but Privy Council
<br>Deputy Secretary David Mulroney (who leads the interagency on
<br>Afghanistan) now has the lead on developing one (septel).
<br>Dr. Cohen remarked, and Judd agreed, that it would be
<br>necessary to avoid approaching Pakistan as simply an adjunct
<br>to the ISAF and OEF missions in Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶10.  (S/NF) CSIS is far from being "high-five mode" on
<br>Q10.  (S/NF) CSIS is far from being "high-five mode" on
<br>Afghanistan, Judd asserted, due in part to Karzai's weak
<br>leadership, widespread corruption, the lack of will to press
<br>ahead on counter-narcotics, limited Afghan security force
<br>capability (particularly the police) and, most recently, the
<br>Sarpoza prison break.  He commented that CSIS had seen
<br>Sarpoza coming, and its link to the Quetta Shura in Pakistan,
<br>but could not get a handle on the timing.
<br>
<br>Iranian Outreach
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶11.  (S/NF) Judd added that he and his colleagues are "very,
<br>very worried" about Iran.  CSIS recently talked to Iran's
<br>Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) after that
<br>agency requested its own channel of communication to Canada,
<br>he said.  The Iranians agreed to "help" on Afghan issues,
<br>including sharing information regarding potential attacks.
<br>However, "we have not figured out what they are up to," Judd
<br>confided, since it is clear that the "Iranians want ISAF to
<br>bleed...slowly."

<br>¶12.  (U)  Dr. Cohen has cleared this message.
