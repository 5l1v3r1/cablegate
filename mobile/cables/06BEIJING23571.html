<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1.  (C) China wants the United States Government to take
<br>action to get Google to reduce the resolution of the Google
<br>Earth images of China's military, nuclear, space, energy and
<br>other sensitive government agency installations in order to
<br>deprive terrorists of potentially dangerous information, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told
<br>the DCM on XXXXXXXXXXXX said the Beijing request was
<br>based on possible "grave consequences" if terrorists exploit
<br>the information to harm China.  Google Earth is a private
<br>company, the DCM reminded XXXXXXXXXXXX was noncommittal on
<br>whether China would directly contact Google or the European
<br>imagery providers and the other sources of high resolution
<br>imagery on the Internet.  Other countries have shared similar
<br>concerns with China, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, but he refused to divulge
<br>country names. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Google Earth High Resolution Images a Threat to China
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>
<br>¶2.  (C) Google Earth is providing high resolution images of
<br>sensitive Chinese facilities over the Internet, thereby
<br>endangering PRC national security, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told
<br>the DCM during a XXXXXXXXXXXX meeting.  These facilities
<br>include military installations, nuclear test sites, satellite
<br>launch sites, oil production facilities, power generating
<br>plants and important government departments.  The resolution
<br>is one meter for most of China, and is as fine as 0.6 meters
<br>in Beijing and Shanghai, allowing anyone with Internet access
<br>to view these facilities in great detail.  Moreover, Google
<br>Earth allows users to post information about specific
<br>locations, XXXXXXXXXXXX continued, which means information about
<br>important Chinese agencies and sensitive installations is
<br>effectively being published on the Internet.
<br>
<br>"Grave Consequences" if Terrorists Use Imagery
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said China is extremely concerned that
<br>terrorist organizations could access the high resolution
<br>imagery and posted information and present a grave threat to
<br>PRC national security.  If terrorists used the imagery from
<br>Google Earth to cause damage to China, there would be "grave
<br>consequences," warned XXXXXXXXXXXX.  In the spirit of our sound
<br>bilateral cooperative relationship, particularly on
<br>counterterrorism issues, XXXXXXXXXXXX asked that the United States
<br>place "great importance" on China's concerns, understand the
<br>sensitivity of the matter and take action so that Google will
<br>reduce the resolution of the images of China's sensitive
<br>facilities.
<br>
<br>DCM: Google a Private Company, and Not Imagery Source
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The DCM told XXXXXXXXXXXX that he would report the request
<br>to Washington, but noted that Google is a private company.
<br>The DCM said he had no information to offer on what, if any,
<br>role or response the United States Government might have to
<br>the Chinese presentation.  The DCM noted that the Chinese
<br>points only asked for a reduction in the resolution and asked
<br>if the Chinese sought any specific level.  The DCM also asked
<br>whether XXXXXXXXXXXX had contacted Google directly and, since
<br>Google purchases the imagery as any individual or entity can,
<br>whether China had contacted the satellite imagery providers.
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX: Other, Unspecified Countries Have Similar Concerns
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX responded that China is approaching the United
<br>States Government because the issue is directly relevant to
<br>counterterrorism and that while Google is a private company
<br>it operates in the United States "political and legal
<br>environment."  China is requesting the United States take
<br>action to prevent the information from being misused to cause
<br>damage to China, XXXXXXXXXXXX reiterated.  He offered that China
<br>had been in discussions with other countries with similar
<br>concerns about Google Earth.  However, XXXXXXXXXXXX refused to
<br>provide the names of the other countries, noting he was
<br>unable to share the information due to prior agreements with
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00023571  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>those countries.
<br>
<br>Europe the Source of Imagery, But Google Earth is the Key
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------
<br>
<br>¶5.  (C) China will talk to Google about the "technical
<br>details," XXXXXXXXXXXX continued, adding that it is not for the MFA
<br>to determine the appropriate resolution level.  China knows
<br>the source data comes from European companies, satellite
<br>operators and the European space agency but XXXXXXXXXXXX said China
<br>sees Google as the problem because it makes the information
<br>easily accessible.  When pressed, XXXXXXXXXXXX admitted that
<br>Beijing had not yet contacted the European providers or the
<br>governments associated with the European space program.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said that while China will look at the other Internet
<br>sources of the high resolution imagery, Google,s well known
<br>imagery is of greatest concern.
