<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: Tensions between the UK and Argentina
<br>have risen over the past week over a new drilling campaign in
<br>the Falkland Islands Outer Conservation zone following the
<br>arrival of the Ocean Guardian oil rig in the North Falkland
<br>Basin. Argentina contested the right of the Falkland
<br>Island's Government to license drilling for oil off the coast
<br>of the islands, a British Overseas Territory. UK Foreign
<br>Secretary David Miliband firmly defended the oil exploration
<br>as being in accordance with international law. Desire
<br>Petroleum, a UK-headquartered company, started drilling the
<br>first well on February 22 following five years of
<br>preparation, including acquiring production licenses.
<br>Exploration and production licenses are approved by the
<br>Governor of the Falkland Islands, following consultation with
<br>the UK's Foreign Secretary. The new drilling campaign is
<br>expected to last approximately eight months, as at least two
<br>other companies with E&P licenses within the Falklands
<br>Conservation Zone make use of the rig sequentially. Desire
<br>confirmed that Argentina's actions will not disrupt its
<br>activities and said it had worked closely with the UK's
<br>Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to try to avoid
<br>inflaming tensions. With the exception of the Falklands, HMG
<br>seeks to continue a normal relationship with Argentina. End
<br>summary.
<br>
<br>UK Defends Oil Exploration in Falkland Islands
<br>------------------------ ---------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Tensions mounted between the United Kingdom and
<br>Argentina ahead of a drilling operation in the Falkland
<br>Islands conservation zones by a UK company, Desire Petroleum.
<br>Argentina contested the UK's right to drill for oil off the
<br>coast of the Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory,
<br>and introduced a requirement that vessels traveling to the
<br>Falklands through Argentine waters obtain permits. Foreign
<br>Secretary David Miliband strongly defended the oil
<br>exploration during a February 18 BBC radio interview, saying
<br>it is being conducted in accordance with international law.
<br>In a statement February 23, Chris Bryant, the UK's Foreign
<br>Office Minister with responsibility for the British Overseas
<br>Territories, reiterated UK support for the oil exploration.
<br>He said the Falkland Islands government is entitled to
<br>develop a hydrocarbon industry within its waters. He said
<br>the UK will continue to support the islands in developing
<br>this "legitimate business in its territory." The Falkland
<br>Islands' Legislative Assembly also asserted its right to
<br>develop a hydrocarbon industry within the Islands' waters in
<br>a February 18 press release.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Andrew Allen, Head of the Southern Oceans, team in
<br>FCO's Overseas Territories Directorate, told us February 24
<br>that no UK government would negotiate the sovereignty of the
<br>Falklands with Argentina without the approval of the
<br>islanders, who overwhelmingly opposed any such discussions.
<br>He emphasized HMG desire to continue cooperation with
<br>Argentina on all other issues. He said that Argentina
<br>appeared to be taking a similar same stance, noting a GOA
<br>statement that it would proceed in legal, diplomatic ways.
<br>Allen said the Argentine Government had so far applied its
<br>decree requiring permits for shipping between the mainland
<br>and the Falklands only to one ship and that cruise ships were
<br>continuing travel between Argentine ports and the islands.
<br>In any event, he said there was little shipping and air
<br>traffic between the Falklands and Argentina. Allen noted
<br>that the main supply links to the islands were a weekly
<br>flight to Chile and cargo shipping to and from Uruguay and
<br>Brazil. He expressed some concern that these countries could
<br>in the future be tempted to restrict those links out of
<br>solidarity with Argentina.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Desire Petroleum started the new drilling campaign
<br>on February 22. Drilling on the "Liz" well in the North
<br>Falkland Basin is expected to last 30 days. An oil rig
<br>platform, the Ocean Guardian, which is owned by U.S. based
<br>Diamond Drilling, was towed from Scotland and arrived
<br>approximately 62 miles north of the islands in the South
<br>Atlantic on February 19. Desire said the rig is firmly
<br>inside British waters and that Argentine protestations would
<br>not disrupt its activities. (Note: Julia Painting, Head of
<br>the Falkland Islands section within the FCO's Overseas
<br>Territories Directorate, said the Falkland Islands' waters
<br>extend 200 nautical miles off the coast of the islands and
<br>consist of the Falkland Interim Conservation Zone of 100
<br>nautical miles (FICZ) and the Falkland Outer Conservation
<br>
<br>LONDON 00000439 002.3 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>Zone of 200 nautical miles (FOCZ). There are several "kinks"
<br>in the conservation zones where they meet the Argentinean
<br>Exclusive Economic Zone. End note.) Another official in the
<br>same office explained to us that the FOCZ is the Falkland's
<br>Exclusive Economic Zone, in all but name. Earlier
<br>governments had decided to use FICZ and FOCZ to avoid
<br>arousing tensions over the term. The official noted that a
<br>drilling rig had operated in the FOCZ in the late 1990s,
<br>provoking no protests from Argentina. According to FCO, this
<br>was a period when then President Menem was seeking
<br>cooperation with the Falklands.
<br>
<br>Falkland Islands Oil Licensing System
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Oil exploration and production within the
<br>Falkland's conservation zones require licenses granted by the
<br>Islands' government. Plans to drill must be approved by the
<br>Governor of the Falkland Islands. The Governor grants
<br>approval having consulted with the UK's Foreign Secretary.
<br>All applications are scrutinized by both the Falkland Islands
<br>and UK authorities. The Falkland Islands' Department of
<br>Mineral Resources advises the Islands' Governor with regard
<br>to local exploration concerns. Officials from the UK's
<br>Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) told us DECC
<br>only offers technical advice to the UK's Foreign and
<br>Commonwealth Office (FCO). However, they noted that
<br>decisions regarding the development of the Falkland Islands'
<br>hydrocarbon industry are ultimately a matter for the Falkland
<br>Islands government.
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) The licensing system consists of exploration licenses
<br>and production licenses. Exploration licenses allow
<br>companies to gather seismic, gravity, magnetic, geochemical,
<br>and sea-bed data and do not allow drilling deeper than 350
<br>meters below the sea-bed. They are not area-specific and can
<br>apply to all of the designated area ) which covers 400,000
<br>kilometers squared, approximately 50 percent bigger than the
<br>UK's North Sea. Licenses are typically awarded for one year,
<br>but can be renewed for up to three years. Production
<br>licenses are area-specific and provide exclusive rights for
<br>surveying, drilling and production. They are awarded through
<br>occasional competitive rounds or, more typically, under an
<br>open-door system. Bids for open-door production licenses can
<br>be made at any time for any number of whole blocks (12'
<br>longitude by 10' latitude) up to a total of 30 continuous
<br>blocks in any one license. Applicants can determine the size
<br>and shape of the area they bid for and there is no limit to
<br>the number of licenses that can be applied for at any time.
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) The Falklands' fiscal system comprises a variable
<br>acreage rental, 9 percent royalty on production, and 26
<br>percent corporation tax on profits. Acreage rentals are
<br>payable annually in advance. Rents vary depending on the
<br>license phase and whether the license was awarded as a result
<br>of a competitive licensing round or as the result of an
<br>open-door invitation. There are no signature bonuses, no
<br>production sharing contracts, no back-rights and no local
<br>market discounts. The Falkland Islands welcome applications
<br>from companies worldwide. However, according to the
<br>Department of Mineral Resources, the Falkland Islands
<br>government is unlikely to grant a license to any applicant in
<br>which Argentine interests hold more than a 49 percent stake.
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Existing production license holders are: Desire
<br>Petroleum, Argos Resources, Falkland Oil and Gas Ltd/BHP
<br>Billiton, Borders and Southern Petroleum, and Rockhopper
<br>Exploration. Previous operators have included Shell, Amerada
<br>Hess, Lasmo and IPC/Lundin Oil. Most of the current license
<br>holders are listed on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative
<br>Investment Market (AIM). All combined, they have raised in
<br>excess of GBP 250 million in recent months to fund drilling
<br>operations.
<br>
<br>Desire Petroleum
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Desire Petroleum, which has started the new
<br>drilling campaign, is dedicated to explore for oil and gas in
<br>the North Falkland Basin. It was founded in 1996 and is
<br>listed on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment
<br>Market (AIM). It participated in the first round of drilling
<br>in the North Falkland Basin in 1998 and currently operates
<br>six licenses in the area. It estimates recoverable oil
<br>potential in the region at 3.5 billion barrels, with gas
<br>reserves of over 9 trillion cubic feet. (Note: ExxonMobil
<br>International Chairman Brad Corson told us he does not
<br>
<br>LONDON 00000439 003.3 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>believe there is enough oil on the Falkland Islands
<br>Continental Shelf to be profitable, citing Shell's earlier
<br>oil exploration attempts which they abandoned. End note.)
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) The current drilling campaign is expected to last
<br>approximately eight months, according to Ben Willey, a
<br>spokesman for Desire. Willey told us that if all runs
<br>smoothly, the Ocean Guardian rig will drill between six and
<br>eight wells. The first well, already underway, is for Desire
<br>in the North Falklands Basin. The drilling is expected to
<br>last 30 days. After this, the rig will start on a second
<br>well, also in the North Basin, for Rockhopper Exploration.
<br>The third well will be drilled for the Falkland Oil and
<br>Gas/BHP Billiton joint venture, the fourth for Rockhopper and
<br>the fifth for Desire. Depending on the success of these
<br>wells, Desire may decide to drill up to three additional
<br>wells. Its contract with Diamond Drilling, the rig owner,
<br>allows for up to eight wells.
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Willey stressed that Desire worked very closely
<br>with the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) over the
<br>past five years throughout the planning stages of the
<br>drilling campaign. During the past few weeks, while tensions
<br>with Argentina have mounted, he said Desire has sought
<br>further advice from the FCO and cleared all statements with
<br>the department to ensure the company does not further inflame
<br>the situation. Willey said Desire has also built good
<br>relations with the Falkland Islands government. He confirmed
<br>that the rig passed entirely through international waters on
<br>its journey from Scotland to the North Falkland Basin.
<br>
<br>Additional Companies Operating In The Falklands
<br>--------------------- -------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) -- Rockhopper Exploration, also AIM-listed, has
<br>licenses to explore for oil and gas in the North Falkland
<br>Basin. It raised GBP 50 million through an equity placement
<br>in late 2009 to finance its 2010 drilling campaign in the
<br>Falklands.
<br>
<br>-- Falkland Oil and Gas, which is also an
<br>AIM-listed UK company, focuses on oil and gas exploration in
<br>the undrilled South and East Falkland Basins. It is involved
<br>in a joint venture with BHP Billiton.
<br>
<br>-- BHP Billiton is an Anglo-Australian natural
<br>resources company. It is one of world's largest mining
<br>companies and its products include petroleum, aluminum, iron
<br>ore, diamonds, manganese and coal. BHP Billiton owns a 51
<br>percent stake in its joint venture with Falkland Oil and Gas.
<br>The joint venture was agreed in October 2007.
<br>
<br>-- Borders & Southern Petroleum focuses on
<br>emerging hydrocarbon systems. Its first project is based in
<br>an untested basin to the south of the Falkland Islands. The
<br>company was awarded its first exploration license in the
<br>Falkland Islands in 2004 and in 2005 listed on the AIM,
<br>raising GBP 10 million.
<br>
<br>-- Argos Resources is a private exploration
<br>company and holds a production license in the North Falkland
<br>Basin.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Comment: UK government officials have made public
<br>statements asserting the right of the Falkland Islands to
<br>issue exploration and production licenses in its conservation
<br>zones in accordance with international law. However, they
<br>have sought to downplay the row and the impact it could have
<br>on the UK's relationship with Argentina and other Latin
<br>American countries. HMG has attempted to avoid escalating
<br>tensions and has stressed HMG's desire to pursue normal
<br>relations with Argentina in all other matters. FCO hopes
<br>that Argentina will proceed similarly.
