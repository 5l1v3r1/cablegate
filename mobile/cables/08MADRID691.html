<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Mariano Rajoy, the embattled head of Spain's main
<br>opposition Partido Popular (PP), was re-elected as party
<br>leader on June 21 during the three-day PP congress held in
<br>Valencia. As reported in REFTEL, Rajoy's leadership had been
<br>challenged on several fronts since his party lost a second
<br>straight national election to President Zapatero's Spanish
<br>Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) and it was unclear if he would
<br>be able to hold on to power. Over the past few weeks,
<br>would-be challengers found insufficient support for their
<br>candidacy to unseat Rajoy and faded back into the woodwork,
<br>leaving Rajoy to run unopposed. He further distanced himself
<br>from the shadow of former President Jose Maria Aznar by
<br>announcing a younger, more moderate party secretariat on June
<br>19 that won plaudits from even left-leaning national
<br>newspapers, and now appears to be basking in the glory of a
<br>successfully-completed party congress. However, many in
<br>Spain believe Rajoy has overcome only the first in a long
<br>series of leadership battles in advance of the next round of
<br>national elections in 2012, and he will need to show positive
<br>results in off-year regional and European elections if he
<br>hopes to have a third consecutive chance to grab the brass
<br>ring of the Spanish presidency.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Approximately 3,025 PP delegates gathered from 20-22
<br>June in the seaside city of Valencia, Spain, to approve the
<br>party's political platform for the next four years, under the
<br>motto "We Grow Together." Over 84% of these delegates voted
<br>for Rajoy to continue as party leader. This vote tally was
<br>the lowest of any PP leader since the party was reformed in
<br>1989, but should serve to silence critics for now. Rajoy was
<br>coming off a tough 100-day period following the March 9
<br>election loss and had to deal with tumult and dissension in
<br>his party's ranks and open criticism from staunch PP members
<br>such as Madrid Regional President Esperanza Aguirre, former
<br>Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja, Congressional foreign
<br>policy spokesman Gustavo Aristegui, party communications
<br>secretary Gabriel Elorriaga, and PP campaign strategist Juan
<br>Costa. In addition, the popular leader of the PP's political
<br>allies in the Basque Country, Maria San Gil, stated publicly
<br>in May that she had lost confidence in the leadership of
<br>Rajoy and his team. Nevertheless, opposition to Rajoy proved
<br>to be a mile wide and an inch deep and faded away once it
<br>became clear that no single alternative candidate had enough
<br>support to overthrow the sitting leader.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Rajoy appears to have put to rest for the time being
<br>any doubts about his PP leadership, and his new team is
<br>receiving generally positive reviews from across the
<br>political spectrum. Pundits are highlighting not only the
<br>collective experience and competence of the group gained from
<br>positions at the local, regional, and national levels, but
<br>also their backgrounds (including a single working mother)
<br>designed to present a more moderate face and hopefully appeal
<br>to a wider swath of Spanish voters. We believe Rajoy is
<br>definitely strengthened coming out of the party conference
<br>and has a mandate to reform the party in his own image--but
<br>his new team will be expected to achieve results quickly if
<br>he hopes to lead the party's national ticket in 2012. As we
<br>have reportedly previously, we believe Rajoy owes his
<br>longevity as much as anything to the lack of a credible
<br>successor within his own party, but many are waiting in the
<br>wings should he stumble again. Key off-year elections are
<br>coming up in the Basque Country (scheduled for early 2009),
<br>Galicia (June 2009), and the European Parliament (June 2009),
<br>and PP supporters will demand to see positive results as
<br>reward for having remained patient while Rajoy finds his way.
