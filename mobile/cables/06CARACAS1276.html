<br>
<br>¶1. Actions requested - see para 12. 
<br>
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Brazilian Ambassador Joao Carlos da Sousa Gomes, 
<br>acting on instructions, proposed that we trade licensing for 
<br>U.S. components in the Tucano aircraft for Brazilian support 
<br>for Sumate with the BRV. That sounds like a bad trade to us, 
<br>but we asked whether GOB would be willing to discuss help 
<br>regarding the BRV's push for a non-permanent UNSC seat. Da 
<br>Sousa Gomes said the Bolivarians were unhappy with Brazilian 
<br>FM Amorim's criticism of the BRV role in the nationalization 
<br>of the Bolivian hydrocarbon industry, resulting in a call 
<br>from a nervous FM Rodriguez demanding a "retraction." The 
<br>Brazilian made clear that despite this rough patch, Brasilia 
<br>had a lasting interest in maintaining good relations with 
<br>Caracas. Da Sousa Gomes, in the mood to chat, also shared 
<br>the details of a "chilling" conversation he had had with 
<br>Iranian Ambassador Sobhani, who was apparently unconcerned 
<br>about the prospects of a broader conflict over the nuclear 
<br>impasse. Finally, da Sousa Gomes told us of a recent talk 
<br>with Cuban Ambassador Sanchez, who attacked Sumate and 
<br>related details of the carnal activities of fellow 
<br>ambassadors. We leave to the Department whether to consider 
<br>an approach on the UNSC, as well as whether to offer the GOB 
<br>a briefing on Iranian support for terrorism in the 
<br>hemisphere. End summary. 
<br>
<br>Tucanos for Sumate 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Ambassador and DCM met with Brazilian Ambassador 
<br>Joao Carlos da Sousa Gomes on May 10 at his request to 
<br>discuss a number of issues. Da Sousa Gomes was principally 
<br>interested in proposing a "deal" to permit licensing of U.S. 
<br>components of Tucano aircraft to Venezuela. Stating that his 
<br>message came direct from Brazilian FM Amorim, he said that 
<br>Brazil was still deeply interested in selling the Tucanos to 
<br>the BRV. He argued that permitting the sale would give the 
<br>GOB the ability to influence the BRV; taken the other way, 
<br>the inability to complete the sale undercut Brazil's 
<br>moderating influence in Caracas. Admitting that this was a 
<br>"difficult issue for USG," da Sousa Gomes said he was 
<br>authorized to propose a trade: the United States gives on 
<br>the Tucanos, and GOB takes a more proactive stance with the 
<br>BRV on Sumate. Da Sousa Gomes said this help would be 
<br>particularly useful now, because he believed another BRV 
<br>assault on Sumate was likely in the near future. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The Ambassador replied that he could not speak to 
<br>the Tucanos; that was a decision made in Washington. Having 
<br>said that, he noted the proposed Brazilian action on Sumate 
<br>was symbolic, whereas the Tucanos were real. It would be 
<br>difficult to sell such a linkage to Washington. On the other 
<br>hand, there was one very concrete issue that Brazil could be 
<br>helpful on: Venezuela's bid for a non-permanent seat on the 
<br>UNSC. While he emphasized he was not speaking on 
<br>instructions, the Ambassador said that such a linkage would 
<br>be more concrete and, therefore, perhaps compelling to the 
<br>USG. Da Sousa Gomes was skeptical, noting that the BRV's 
<br>early commitment to permanent seat for Brazil on UNSC made it 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00001276 002.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>difficult for the GOB to fail to back the BRV for a temporary 
<br>seat. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Ambassador delved further. GRULAC is obviously 
<br>split over the issue of its candidate for the nonpermanent 
<br>seat. If pushed by a large, influential nation interested in 
<br>ensuring consensus, the GRULAC might find a candidate other 
<br>than Venezuela who might receive consensus support. He 
<br>concluded this part of the discussion by indicating that he 
<br>doubted that Washington would reopen Tucano decision, but 
<br>might be more inclined to do so if it were part of a package 
<br>to solve our mutual problem of the BRV's candidacy for a 
<br>non-permanent UNSC seat. 
<br>
<br>Brazilian Push-back Touches Bolivarian Nerve 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) We began the conversation discussing the news of the 
<br>day, FM Amorim's strong push-back against the BRV for its 
<br>role in the nationalization of the Bolivian gas industry. Da 
<br>Sousa Gomes made a number of observations about the GOB's 
<br>views that were identical to those already reported by 
<br>Embassy Brasilia (refs). He took credit for the idea of 
<br>Amorim's strong words, saying he'd argued that the BRV 
<br>respected a government that stood up for itself. That said, 
<br>da Sousa Gomes said that Brasilia had no interest in 
<br>provoking a further crisis over this matter. Venezuela was a 
<br>neighbor, and they needed to find ways to get along. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Brazilian ambassador said that the BRV was 
<br>stirred up by Amorim's words. BRV FM Ali Rodriguez called 
<br>him even before Amorim had finished speaking to demand a 
<br>"retraction." da Sousa Gomes told him that was impossible, 
<br>so a flustered Rodriguez insisted on speaking with Amorim 
<br>directly, to make the same points. He got no satisfaction in 
<br>that call. According to da Sousa Gomes, President Chavez 
<br>himself called Brasilia, seeking to speak with President 
<br>Lula, but Lula did not take the call. (Note: Both 
<br>presidents will be at the EU-Latin America summit, so Chavez 
<br>will doubtless corner Lula, there if not before.) 
<br>
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) da Sousa Gomes then turned to a recent conversation 
<br>he had with Iranian Ambassador Ahmad Sobhani. According to 
<br>da Sousa Gomes, Sobhani told him that there was a great deal 
<br>of misinformation about Iran's activities in Venezuela. 
<br>There was no collaboration on nuclear matters, and Sobhani 
<br>derided Venezuela's tiny nuclear research program as 
<br>unserious. Sobhani said that the stories about a uranium 
<br>mining operation were also untrue. When the Brazilian 
<br>queried about the impasse in the IAEA and now the UN on the 
<br>Iranian nuclear program, Sobhani said that Iran had a problem 
<br>with the United States and "all of Europe" on this issue, and 
<br>would not back down. The ability to run its own peaceful 
<br>nuclear program was a point of principle for Iran. Da Sousa 
<br>Gomes said that he came away from the conversation chilled by 
<br>the Iranian's unconcern over the prospect that his 
<br>government's actions might provoke a broader conflict. The 
<br>Brazilian offered to give us a written summary of his report 
<br>to Brasilia for our information. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The Ambassador was grateful for the information, and 
<br>underlined our strong concerns about Iran-Venezuela links. 
<br>Our concerns focused in three separate areas. First, on the 
<br>nuclear front, for reasons well known to all. Second, the 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00001276 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>United States is increasingly concerned that Iranian 
<br>know-how, both technical and in terms of avoiding U.S. 
<br>prohibitions on the sale of military parts to Iran, would 
<br>help the BRV evade any limitations on the sale of military 
<br>parts to the BRV. Finally, and most importantly, we are 
<br>concerned about terrorism. Iran has a well-known link with 
<br>Hezbollah, a deadly terrorist organization. The Iranian 
<br>government has pledged to attack the U.S. homeland if 
<br>attacked. We are worried that an Iranian-supported Hezbollah 
<br>or other terrorist presence in Venezuela could represent a 
<br>threat to the United States. Da Sousa Gomes clearly had not 
<br>thought this last issue through, and asked if we could 
<br>provide additional information. The Ambassador agreed to 
<br>look into the matter, noting that obviously any such 
<br>discussions would occur in Brasilia or Washington. 
<br>
<br>Cuba 
<br>---- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Finally, the chatty da Sousa Gomes gave us his 
<br>readout on a recent lunch with Cuban Ambassador German 
<br>Sanchez Otero. (Note: Da Sousa Gomes said that he could 
<br>attest to the long-serving (over 11 years in Caracas) 
<br>Sanchez' close ties to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro; the old 
<br>rascal called Sanchez three times during the course of the 
<br>lunch!) According to da Sousa Gomes, Sanchez is totally 
<br>plugged in to the Bolivarian government, relating in a 
<br>detailed fashion the inner workings of various ministries. 
<br>Sanchez also eagerly discussed Venezuelan internal political 
<br>developments, focusing of course on the upcoming presidential 
<br>elections. Sanchez had nice things to say about left-wing 
<br>candidate Teodoro Petkoff, at least at a personal level; da 
<br>Sousa Gomes noted that he's heard similar expressions of 
<br>personal affection for Petkoff from Bolivarian officials. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) da Sousa Gomes was particularly struck by two 
<br>elements of his conversation with Sanchez: first, a deep 
<br>hatred for Sumate, which Sanchez claimed was a subversive 
<br>organization funded by the CIA which had to be stopped. (da 
<br>Sousa Gomes' earlier warning that the BRV might have planned 
<br>a fresh assault on Sumate (para 3) may have in part been 
<br>informed by Sanchez harsh words for the NGO). Second, 
<br>Sanchez delighted in relating the prurient details of the 
<br>personal lives of other ambassadors accredited here. Da 
<br>Sousa Gomes added that he believed that some ambassadors 
<br>actually submitted written reports to the BRV on the 
<br>peccadilloes of their fellow ambassadors. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Actions requested: 
<br>
<br>-- Tucano trade: We oppose reconsidering the Tucano decision 
<br>for a promise to be proactive on Sumate. It is the 
<br>Department's call whether to pursue a possible Tucano-UNSC 
<br>connection. 
<br>
<br>-- Briefing to the GOB on Iran: da Sousa Gomes seemed 
<br>genuinely taken aback by the notion that an Iranian 
<br>diplomatic presence might support Hezbollah or another FTO in 
<br>the Western Hemisphere. Washington and Embassy Brasilia may 
<br>want to consider a detailed briefing on this matter to 
<br>relevant GOB officials.
