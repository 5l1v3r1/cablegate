<br>SUBJECT: WHA A/S VALENZUELA RECEIVED BY EAGER BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT 
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Lisa Kubiske, charge d'affaires a.i.; REASON: 1.4(D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. On his first visit to Brazil as Assistant 
<br>Secretary, Arturo Valenzuela was received December 14 by senior 
<br>government officials eager to minimize differences and demonstrate 
<br>their interest in working with the USG on a range of topics. 
<br>Meetings with the Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor, Foreign 
<br>Ministry (Itamaraty) officials, and Defense Minister addressed 
<br>shared concerns with resolving the crisis in Honduras, the need to 
<br>lower tensions in South America (particularly between Colombia and 
<br>Venezuela), interest in working together in Haiti, and 
<br>possibilities for counternarcotics cooperation in Bolivia. Whereas 
<br>the Presidency highlighted Lula's efforts related to Iran and the 
<br>Middle East peace process, Itamaraty focused on the need to expand 
<br>our bilateral, regional, and trilateral cooperation, as well as our 
<br>discussions on global issues into new areas. The worried media 
<br>reports highlighting "tensions" in the U.S.-Brazil relationship 
<br>prior to A/S Valenzuela's arrival were replaced following his visit 
<br>with upbeat stories regarding the renewed possibilities for 
<br>cooperation. End summary. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Garcia Focuses on Honduras... 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In a long and friendly meeting, Presidential Foreign Policy 
<br>Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia laid out Brazil's position and ongoing 
<br>concerns regarding Honduras. He said President Zelaya's decision 
<br>to go abroad had given Brazil greater "flexibility" in dealing with 
<br>the crisis. Brazil believes it is essential for de facto leader 
<br>Micheletti to step down, and Garcia expressed his hopes that the 
<br>USG would "turn the screws" on him. Personally, Garcia said he 
<br>thought a constituent assembly would be a way to give legitimacy to 
<br>the political solution being crafted. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A/S Valenzuela disagreed with Garcia's assertion that the 
<br>Honduras crisis had created "a division" between the United States 
<br>and Latin America. Rather, he said the failed effort by Mexico to 
<br>gain safe passage for Zelaya out of the country, of which the USG 
<br>had not been informed and which had negatively affected other 
<br>efforts on Zelaya's behalf, demonstrated the need for more fluid 
<br>communication. In later discussions at Itamaraty, Honduras was 
<br>also a leading topic of conversation. There, officials insisted 
<br>that they had no contact with the Micheletti regime and that their 
<br>ability to influence Zelaya was limited. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>...Proposes U.S. Visit to Venezuela... 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Garcia made a point to reiterate a suggestion he had made to 
<br>NSA General Jones, that Valenzuela should go to Caracas to 
<br>establish a "direct link" and relationship with President Chavez. 
<br>Without such a move, Garcia said, "Chavez will respond to everyone" 
<br>(i.e., to USG officials whatever their position); "he has no sense 
<br>of proportion." Garcia said that, because of "ambiguity" and "a 
<br>bad process," the issue of the Colombia bases had complicated 
<br>matters in the region. Although the November 27 meeting of the 
<br>South American Defense Council (SADC) had reduced tensions, the 
<br>idea that the bases might be used to launch an action against 
<br>Venezuela "was common." Neither Colombia nor Venezuela was willing 
<br>to make a goodwill gesture toward the other, and Brazil's efforts 
<br>to mediate had been rebuffed by both sides. He predicted that 
<br>Venezuela "will maintain the pressure" on Colombia for several 
<br>months. Venezuelan FM Maduro had indicated to Garcia that a visit 
<br>by A/S Valenzuela would be "no problem" to arrange; Garcia felt it 
<br>would help reduce tensions and improve dialogue with the region. 
<br>A/S Valenzuela was noncommittal, and noted that it is difficult to 
<br>ignore both the provocative statements by Chavez and his 
<br>authoritarian tendencies. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>...Assesses Regional Developments... 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Over the course of the conversation, Garcia expressed a 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001447 002 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>preference for former President Frei in Chile's elections; 
<br>described Ecuador's and Bolivia's political systems as "rotten"; 
<br>said that Mujica's election in Uruguay was good as he would be 
<br>"more active"; and called the future of Argentina "a big question 
<br>mark," depending on whether the Kirchners recover or not, although 
<br>he did not foresee problems for relations with Brazil. Garcia 
<br>hoped to "revive Mercosur" during the upcoming Argentine 
<br>presidency. With regard to relations with the United States, 
<br>Garcia noted that the "delay" in USG initiatives toward the region 
<br>caused frustration and disappointment. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>... And Indicates Middle East Peace and Iran Top Brazil's Global 
<br>Agenda 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Beyond Latin America, Garcia described Brazil's priorities 
<br>as climate change and expanding participation in the Middle East 
<br>peace process "to put more air" into them. Brazil is concerned 
<br>with the success of the Israel-Palestine peace process both because 
<br>of the impact on its own global interests and because it 
<br>"contaminates" other issues in the region-including Iran, 
<br>Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Garcia said Brazil has encouraged Iran 
<br>to use its influence with Hamas to help move the process forward. 
<br>With regard to Iran itself, Garcia described Brazil's engagement as 
<br>"a bet" that might not work. In light of President Obama's request 
<br>to help, Brazil is trying to build a relationship with Iran. He 
<br>described Brazil's reception of President Ahmadinejad in November 
<br>as "not warm" and stressed that President Lula had delivered 
<br>"direct messages." Brazil is encouraging Iran to "submit to the 
<br>rules," regarding non-proliferation, but Brazil had abstained on 
<br>the recent IAEA vote on Iran as because of the timing; a vote in 
<br>favor at that moment would have neutralized their efforts to sway 
<br>Iran. In Brazil's view, the worst thing to do is to further 
<br>isolate Iran. A/S Valenzuela welcomed Brazil's efforts to 
<br>encourage Iran to comply with its international obligations but 
<br>expressed serious concerns with their nuclear aspirations. He 
<br>emphasized that Iran had a deficit of trust with the international 
<br>community but assured Garcia that the Administration would continue 
<br>to try to engage Iran, despite the difficulties. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Itamaraty: Eager to Move Forward Bilaterally... 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Over lunch with Under Secretary for Political Affairs Vera 
<br>Machado and acting Under Secretary for Latin America GonC'alo 
<br>MourC#o, and in a separate meeting with newly installed Deputy 
<br>Minister and former ambassador to the United States AntC4nio 
<br>Patriota, Brazilian officials stressed the need to move forward in 
<br>expanding our bilateral relationship. Patriota cited the 
<br>high-level dialogue we are hoping to start and said the GOB is glad 
<br>there is a broadening of the bilateral political agenda to match 
<br>the excellent dialogue on the economic side. With regard to 
<br>current cooperation, he praised the Economic Policy Dialogue, under 
<br>way at the same time in Washington, and said that Civilian 
<br>Household (Prime) Minister Dilma Rousseff wants to see more 
<br>bilateral cooperation on biofuels. He highlighted the success of 
<br>the Joint Action Plan to eliminate racial and ethnic discrimination 
<br>(JAPER) and suggested creating linkages with the CEO Forum. Both 
<br>he and Machado said Brazil has much to learn from the United States 
<br>regarding inclusion of civil society and the private sector in such 
<br>initiatives. Patriota noted the meeting of the Brazil Studies 
<br>Association (BRASA) next year as a good opportunity to do some 
<br>cross-fertilization between private sector and social initiatives. 
<br>Patriota hoped we could increase discussions on other social 
<br>issues, including human rights and advancement of women. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Patriota and Machado both expressed interest in moving 
<br>forward with the Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) and asked for 
<br>serious consideration of language Brazil had just proposed on 
<br>"guarantees" of respect for sovereignty of third countries, which 
<br>Brazil was seeking to add in light of concerns over the 
<br>U.S.-Colombia DCA and commitments made at the November 27 meeting 
<br>of the South America Defense Council. 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001447 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Although even the suggestion of work on terrorism-related 
<br>programs has caused problems in Brazil for some USG agencies, 
<br>Machado acknowledged that Brazil would need to address potential 
<br>terrorism issues with Brazil's hosting of the 2014 World Cup and 
<br>the 2016 Olympics. A/S Valenzuela said the USG is willing to 
<br>cooperate and assist in any way we can and he suggested that State 
<br>and Itamaraty should increase our effort to coordinate cooperation 
<br>among our various agencies in advance of these events. ChargC) 
<br>d'Affaires Kubiske noted that the Olympics also open an avenue for 
<br>cooperation to advance social issues, for example, by ensuring that 
<br>efforts are made to secure English training and jobs for minorities 
<br>and the poor. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>...Regionally... 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) A/S Valenzuela stressed that Secretary Clinton is committed 
<br>to working closely and more intently on Haiti. The United States 
<br>can benefit from Brazil's expertise in Haiti and the region, he 
<br>said. Acting U/S MourC#o said Brazil's focus in Haiti is on 
<br>policing, as it is important to strengthen Haiti's law enforcement 
<br>capabilities. Patriota noted the efforts of USAID and Brazil's 
<br>Cooperation Agency (ABC) to establish joint projects. He recalled 
<br>that, in the second paragraph of President Lula's letter to 
<br>President Obama last month, he had mentioned the priority of 
<br>constructing a hydroelectric dam and plant. Although the letter 
<br>had suggested a cost of $150 million to build, Patriota believed it 
<br>would actually cost $250 million. He felt this would be an 
<br>important project for the United States and Brazil to work on 
<br>jointly. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) During lunch, Machado asked if Bolivia might be 
<br>re-certified next year for counternarcotics cooperation. A/S 
<br>Valenzuela noted some very strong U.S. opposition to this, but said 
<br>that strong communication with the Morales government is essential 
<br>and suggested that there is now an opportunity for trilateral 
<br>cooperation on counternarcotics. Machado raised the 3+1 Security 
<br>Dialogue between Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and the United 
<br>States, saying the name of the talks should be changed to avoid a 
<br>sense of opposition. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>...And Globally 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Patriota indicated Brazil's interest in expanding 
<br>"trilateral cooperation" between Brazil, the United States, and 
<br>third countries as a particularly valuable form of engagement, 
<br>particularly in Africa. As Brazil is entering the Security Council 
<br>in January, the GOB wants to coordinate agendas with the USG and 
<br>engage more on Security Council reform. Looking ahead to the NPT 
<br>Review Conference and Nuclear Security Summit, Patriota described 
<br>President Obama's speech in Prague on nuclear non-proliferation and 
<br>disarmament as "groundbreaking" and said it was very well received 
<br>in Brazil. For her part, Machado praised the U.S. announcement of 
<br>voluntary measures related to climate change, which had inspired 
<br>"moderate enthusiasm" and preserved the possibility for 
<br>"non-failure" at Copenhagen. She highlighted agreement for Brazil 
<br>to host a "Rio + 20" next year, which would allow for more 
<br>comprehensive debate. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Defense Minister Jobim Describes Brazil's Concern with Regional 
<br>Stability... 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Following a one-on-one meeting, a friendly and engaged 
<br>DefMin Jobim was joined by senior military personnel for a broad 
<br>discussion of regional issues. Jobim raised the U.S.-Colombia DCA, 
<br>saying that, from a strictly Brazilian point of view, there was no 
<br>problem. The region was "sensitive," however, and as Brazil has no 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001447 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>problems with any of its neighbors, it tries to be a "moderator" 
<br>among them. Jobim had made an enormous effort, along with 
<br>Itamaraty and President Lula, to visit all South American countries 
<br>to gain agreement to establish the South American Defense Council, 
<br>which would help create a regional identity on defense issues, 
<br>advance "military diplomacy," link defense to the real economy by 
<br>establishing niches for each country in defense industries, and 
<br>encourage exchanges among military academies. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Noting our common concern with stability in the region, A/S 
<br>Valenzuela asked how Jobim viewed the situation between Colombia 
<br>and Venezuela and the situation in Paraguay. Jobim said that he 
<br>did not see the tensions escalating, but that Lula's efforts to 
<br>mediate a discussion between Chavez and Uribe had not been 
<br>successful. With regard to Paraguay, he said that for political 
<br>reasons Brazil had made concessions on the price it was paying for 
<br>energy from Itaipu and would finance the construction of a 
<br>transmission facility on the Paraguayan side of the border. "This 
<br>is part of the game" with Paraguay, he said. Jobim encouraged A/S 
<br>Valenzuela to continue this dialogue on regional stability. He 
<br>said the United States needs to be "re-introduced" to Latin 
<br>America; although it might be a false impression, there is a 
<br>feeling in the region that the United States needs to build more 
<br>trust following a "difficult era" in the Bush Administration. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>...And Provides an Update on FX2 Fighter Competition 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Jobim noted that delay in a decision on the FX2 fighter 
<br>competition, saying that he would be studying documents from the 
<br>Brazilian Air Force (BRAF) over the holidays and that the National 
<br>Defense Council would meet to make its recommendation after 
<br>congress reconvenes in early February. He was awaiting additional 
<br>documentation from Boeing later in the week and was particularly 
<br>intrigued by the possibilities of the Global Super Hornet program. 
<br>Jobim noted the importance of the purchase in Brazil's national 
<br>defense strategy, adding that technology transfer is the main 
<br>consideration and the U.S. "precedents" on this score are not good; 
<br>but he acknowledged that the portfolio of transfer items was large 
<br>and that it was a new U.S. government. Jobim reiterated the five 
<br>criteria they will be using to make a decision: the quality of the 
<br>platform, the technology being offered, the training being offered, 
<br>the price, and the life-cycle cost. A/S Valenzuela assured him the 
<br>Boeing was best on all counts. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Political Analysts See Less Aggressive Foreign Policy Post-Lula 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶16. (U) Three leading political analysts told A/S Valenzuela that 
<br>Dilma Rousseff, President Lula's choice to succeed him in 2011, has 
<br>at least a break-even chance of winning the October 2010 elections, 
<br>despite Serra's lead in the polls. They expect that many of the 
<br>GOB's current foreign policy positions - including on Iran and 
<br>Honduras - are facilitated by Lula's strong internal position and 
<br>personal reputation, and will not outlast his presidency. They 
<br>described in detail the failure of the delegation of Iranian 
<br>businessmen that accompanied Ahmadinejad, and argued that attempts 
<br>by Rousseff or anyone other than Lula to engage authoritarian 
<br>states in such a high-profile manner would not be tolerated 
<br>domestically, as it is seen as a departure from Brazil's 
<br>traditionally cautious approach to such matters. A Serra 
<br>presidency, they believed, would not alter Brazil's basic economic 
<br>strategy but would lead to a return to more traditional Brazilian 
<br>foreign policy stances, especially in Latin America. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Media Coverage Goes From Nervous and Negative to Hopeful and 
<br>Positive 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶17. (SBU) In advance of A/S Valenzuela's trip, media coverage 
<br>focused on "tensions" in the bilateral relationship, highlighting 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001447 005 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>differences over Honduras, Iran, climate change, and 
<br>non-proliferation. However, following a press roundtable by A/S 
<br>Valenzuela with leading news dailies and weeklies and comments to 
<br>the press by both Garcia and Itamaraty officials, press reports on 
<br>Tuesday, December 15 highlighted apparent points of agreement on 
<br>Honduras and Iran. BrasC-lia daily Correio Braziliense ran one of 
<br>the most powerful headlines: "Disagreements Between Good Allies." 
<br>These reports were reinforced by equally positive headlines in 
<br>online coverage from major news portals such as UOL and Terra. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) Although articles began to reappear within days reporting 
<br>views from both Washington and BrasC-lia that tensions persist in 
<br>the bilateral relationship, prominent columnists have supported the 
<br>conclusion that Valenzuela's visit put the U.S.-Brazil relationship 
<br>on a new footing. One of the more forceful columns came from Folha 
<br>de SC#o Paulo's Eliane Catanhede, who highlighted the contrast 
<br>between the prior expressions of "frustration" and "disappointment" 
<br>from Amorim and Garcia, and the much more friendly remarks they 
<br>made during his visit. Her conclusion was that the GOB knows who 
<br>is really in charge on issues such as Honduras, Iran, and 
<br>Copenhagen: "This is how diplomacy is done: Valenzuela was in 
<br>BrasC-lia yesterday; Secretary Hillary Clinton is on her way; Obama 
<br>should be here early in 2010. Deep down, Lula, Amorim, Jobim, 
<br>Garcia, and [former Itamaraty Secretary General; current Minister 
<br>of Strategic Planning] Samuel [Pinheiro Guimaraes] may bark, but 
<br>they never bite. And the 'pitbull' [the United States] knows its 
<br>own strength." 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Youth Ambassadors Meeting Opens the Door for New Media Outreach 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶19. (U) A/S Valenzuela met with alumni of the Youth Ambassadors, 
<br>Student Leader Exchange, and English Immersion programs in an 
<br>informal gathering hosted by CDA Kubiske. Valenzuela explained his 
<br>role in over-seeing policy for the Western Hemisphere and fielded 
<br>questions from the young leaders on issues ranging from the value 
<br>of youth exchange programs, to the Obama administration's approach 
<br>to U.S.-Brazil relations and the best way to work with the various 
<br>types of democratic systems found in the region. "I think it was a 
<br>great opportunity to meet Dr. Valenzuela and discuss Brazil-U.S 
<br>relations...it's interesting to see how diplomacy engages youth," 
<br>said 2008 Youth Ambassador, Pedro Henrique Torres after his 
<br>discussion with the Assistant Secretary. The Public Affairs 
<br>Section posted photos of the meeting on the Mission's Flickr site 
<br>that were also carried on the Assistant Secretary's newly launched 
<br>blog. PA recorded the event and will create short clips to post on 
<br>the Mission's YouTube channel and to distribute to youth contacts. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶20. (U) A/S Valenzuela cleared this message.
