<br>.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Although the Western Sahara negotiations
<br>have now re-started (Reftel), the conflict is 34 years old.
<br>The Government of Morocco (GOM) has invested tremendous
<br>resources in the territory, and some observers estimate that
<br>it spends USD 2.7 billion per year on the territory and its
<br>385,000 residents. The level of development and of social
<br>services clearly exceeds the level in Morocco proper.
<br>Significant voter participation )- despite a Polisario call
<br>for a boycott -- in the June 12 local elections may be a sign
<br>that support for independence is waning although support for
<br>self-government is real. Serious human rights abusers have
<br>been transferred, and respect for human rights in the
<br>territory has greatly improved, reaching the same plane as in
<br>Morocco. However, advocating independence is still a red
<br>line, and the GOM refuses to register pro-Polisario NGOs.
<br>Giving the territory more autonomy, improving
<br>Algerian-Moroccan relations, enhancing regional integration,
<br>building real confidence, and addressing all parties,
<br>propaganda seem essential to resolving the conflict. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Since King Hassan II launched the Green March in
<br>1975, the Western Sahara issue has been intimately linked to
<br>the stability of the throne and Morocco itself. Hassan,
<br>twice victim of coup attempts and for years at war with the
<br>left, used Western Sahara to bolster nationalism and park his
<br>army far away in the desert. More recently, however, that
<br>link has blurred. King Mohammed VI is more secure,
<br>maintained in power more by love than fear and facing no
<br>apparent major domestic threat. He recently has somewhat
<br>distanced himself from the issue, however, and has not
<br>visited the territory in three years, a stark contrast to his
<br>peripatetic ribbon cutting throughout the Kingdom.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The GOM continues to subsidize the territory and
<br>provide tax and duty exemptions that form the base of much of
<br>the private fortunes there (mostly key clans loyal to the
<br>throne and a few senior military). Despite some siphoning,
<br>the investment has produced higher levels of urban
<br>development than in comparably sized cities in Morocco proper
<br>and made the capital, Laayoune, the first city without any
<br>shantytowns. Social indicators such as access to and level
<br>of education and availability of health care and social
<br>facilities exceed Moroccan norms and far surpass those in
<br>comparably sized Morocco,s cities. Growth in Morocco has
<br>made these expenditures much more bearable to Rabat,s
<br>exchequer than they once were.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) In April 2009, a local weekly newsmagazine TelQuel
<br>published an article laying out and likely even exaggerating
<br>what the Sahara was costing Morocco. TelQuel claimed that
<br>the GOM has spent 1.2 trillion dirhams on the territory since
<br>1975 and is spending 3 percent of GDP or USD 2.7 billion per
<br>year, including the funds to maintain two-thirds of the Royal
<br>Armed Forces in Western Sahara. (Note: TelQuel faced no
<br>consequences for the article. Even with the relative
<br>expansion of the freedom of the press in Morocco to cover
<br>subjects formerly taboo, this was astonishing. End Note.)
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) In the June 12 local elections, &First Friend8
<br>Fouad Ali el Himma,s Party of Authenticity and Modernity
<br>(PAM) challenged local Laayoune strongman and Royal
<br>Consultative Council for Saharan Affairs (CORCAS) head
<br>Kalihenna Ould er Rachid. The PAM lost, despite having an el
<br>Himma protege installed. The Ould er Rachid family and clan
<br>control the Tammany Hall-like Istiqlal party machine that has
<br>run the territory for many years, and played a major part in
<br>winning the Prime Minister,s chair for party head Abbas El
<br>Fassi. Voter participation in the Sahara, stoked by clan
<br>rivalries, was far above the norm, despite a
<br>Polisario-declared boycott. Some pro-independence Sahrawis
<br>reportedly voted for the Ould er Rachid because they alone
<br>were deemed strong enough to stand up to the government in
<br>Rabat. This real political competition, while perhaps not
<br>democracy, seems far more open than the Cuba-like Polisario
<br>system. It underscores the fact that there is a significant
<br>part of the population of the Sahrawi territory, in addition
<br>to most immigrants, who support Moroccan sovereignty.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) After it took control of Western Sahara, Morocco
<br>tried to affect any vote by promoting immigration by its
<br>nationals, who now are well over half of the some 385,000
<br>residents of the territory. Perhaps half of the immigrants,
<br>however, were themselves Sahrawis, from areas just north of
<br>the dividing line that were also home to some of the most
<br>nationalistic Sahrawis. In a referendum that could include
<br>independence, they are not seen by the GOM as reliable
<br>voters, partly explaining GOM reluctance to go to a vote.
<br>(Comment: Curiously, we know of no advocate of independence
<br>that has ever claimed the &Sahrawi8 territories in Morocco,
<br>Algeria or Mauritania as part of a national homeland,
<br>although some members of the CORCAS unsuccessfully tried to
<br>include the Moroccan parts in the autonomous region, when it
<br>was first proposed. The absence of such larger nationalism,
<br>along with the Polisario,s 1970,s war against Mauritania
<br>--the world,s only Sahrawi state -- suggest the conflict is
<br>less nationalist than geopolitical, linked to the much older
<br>dispute between Algeria and Morocco, and hardly boosts the
<br>case for an independent state. End Comment.)
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Given the small population at stake, Spain,s
<br>granting of Spanish nationality, with the possibility of
<br>migrating to Spain, its nearby Canary Islands or elsewhere in
<br>Europe, is significant, and, indeed in better times,
<br>resettlement could be a simple way of resolving the plight of
<br>the refugees.
<br>
<br>-----------
<br>Who Counts?
<br>-----------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The UN process recognizes the parties in the
<br>negotiations as Morocco and the Polisario. This asymmetry
<br>makes any resolution difficult, as it does not recognize the
<br>determinative role of Algiers, which the Moroccans see as
<br>their real adversary in this dispute. It also neglects the
<br>diverse views among the Sahrawis.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>Human Rights: Progress but Continuing Paranoia
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) The human rights situation in the territory has
<br>dramatically improved since a brief &intifada8 in 2005.
<br>Like Morocco itself, Western Sahara has come a very long way
<br>from the mass disappearances of the &years of lead8 during
<br>Hassan II,s reign. Pro-Polisario Sahrawis are able to
<br>organize under the rubric of human rights activists, which
<br>most of them legitimately pursue, such as last year,s RFK
<br>award winner, Aminatou Haidar from the Sahrawi Collective of
<br>Human Rights Defenders (CODESA). In just over a year,
<br>restrictions on their international travel have disappeared.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Since mid-2008, once common beatings and arbitrary
<br>imprisonment have also essentially ceased. One key to the
<br>reduction in abuses last year was the transfer of
<br>long-serving security officials with consistent records as
<br>abusers. Activists and officials confirmed in July 2009 that
<br>more transfers (many by promotion) had recently taken place,
<br>and most well known abusers are reportedly now gone. All
<br>sources report the territory is quiet, with residents hopeful
<br>for some political progress.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) What opponents of Morocco cannot do is explicitly
<br>organize in favor of independence or a referendum thereon,
<br>nor can they publish or even distribute tracts on the
<br>subject. In addition, they are denied by the government the
<br>right to operate as legal entities. Establishing these
<br>rights would not only be just, but would help build
<br>confidence in a consensual solution that would involve
<br>re-integration. The Sahrawi Association of Human Rights
<br>Victims (ASVDH) has even obtained court approval for its
<br>registration as an NGO and won on appeal lodged by the
<br>Interior Ministry (MOI), but has not been able to get local
<br>officials to accept its registration. The USG has pushed for
<br>this for some time. We recently heard that the local Wali
<br>has proposed to MOI that it accept the registration but the
<br>decision is pending. We should press the GOM on this both
<br>here and in Washington.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Despite this substantial progress, which leaves the
<br>human rights situation in Western Sahara nearly equivalent to
<br>Morocco, Morocco campaigned for most of the year and spent
<br>scarce diplomatic capital in a successful effort to push back
<br>proposals for the UN to have a monitoring role on this issue.
<br>It is possible that they have understood the opportunity
<br>costs of that strategy and appear more recently to have been
<br>somewhat less vocal on the issue.
<br>
<br>--------------------
<br>What the People Want
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Extensive interviews and independent sources in the
<br>territory suggest that the principal goal of most Sahrawis is
<br>more self-government than self-determination; a desire more
<br>for protection and identity than independence, an army and
<br>embassies. The small vocally pro-Polisario minority,
<br>including many of the human rights activists, formerly
<br>enjoyed the support of the &silent majority8 of these
<br>Sahrawis, particularly during periods of repression.
<br>Development and reduced oppression have reduced this support.
<br>The Sahrawi &silent majority8 in the territory has been
<br>intrigued by the prospect of autonomy and has generally
<br>quietly awaited its development. Recently, a pro-Polisario
<br>activist, when asked, confided to us that he believed that in
<br>a free election held now a majority of voters in the
<br>territory would choose autonomy.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------
<br>On the Other Side of the Berm
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) While not the competent Mission to comment on the
<br>Polisario or the camps, Embassy Rabat understands the
<br>situation for the refugees in Tindouf is difficult but
<br>support for the Polisario appears strong. Nevertheless, we
<br>hear from credible Sahrawis that there is growing interest
<br>there in a negotiated solution, belying the stories of
<br>unrealistic saber-rattling, frequently attributed to Sahrawi
<br>youth. GOM calls for a census and audit of international
<br>programs seem reasonable to us. Finally, if there is no
<br>prospect of a solution, re-settlement should be considered an
<br>option. The Spanish decision in 2008 to accord passports to
<br>1975 residents of its former colony could be implemented in
<br>Tindouf as it has been in Laayoune (but not in the current
<br>economic climate).
<br>
<br>-------------------
<br>Frozen Negotiations
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Meanwhile, the UN Secretary General,s Personal
<br>Envoy for Western Sahara has struggled to get the UN
<br>negotiations back on track. The negotiation process
<br>re-started in 2007, after Morocco tabled a proposal for
<br>autonomy that had been carefully negotiated with the Bush
<br>Administration. The main impetus to getting the plan
<br>produced was then-USUN Permrep John Bolton,s threat (October
<br>2006) to end MINURSO,s mandate. When first released, the
<br>USG called the autonomy proposal &serious and credible.8
<br>In substance, the proposal was serious, including local
<br>police and some independence for the judiciary, and was
<br>accompanied by a declared willingness to negotiate. It was
<br>also viewed as credible by the international community,
<br>including explicitly Russia and implicitly China, which
<br>nearly universally expressed a willingness to accept this as
<br>a possible outcome, if agreed. Credibility was an issue,
<br>however, among Sahrawis on both sides of the berm, as there
<br>was little confidence, given past Moroccan evasions, that
<br>even if agreed, the GOM would implement the plan. This
<br>credibility gap has narrowed, but only slightly, due to the
<br>improvements in the human rights situation. Credibility is,
<br>therefore, key to winning hearts and minds.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) In April 2007, the United Nations Security Council
<br>lengthened the mandate of MINURSO to 12 months (from six) and
<br>the &Manhasset talks8 (named after the Long Island, New
<br>York town where they were held) began. The Moroccans, while
<br>negotiating with the Polisario, showed them no credence and
<br>sent Moroccan Sahrawis to seek defectors. CORCAS head
<br>Kalihenna questioned the Polisario,s right to be there. The
<br>Polisario broke diplomatic and Middle Eastern protocol by
<br>refusing to shake hands with the Sahrawis on the Moroccan
<br>delegation and walked out or turned away when they spoke.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Neither side offered any compromise or considered
<br>the arguments of the other. This was hardened when, at the
<br>end of 2007, King Mohammed VI publicly instructed his
<br>delegation to discuss no solution but autonomy, creating
<br>little room for discussion. This hard-line stance may have
<br>been bolstered by what was perceived in the Palace as
<br>uncritical support from Washington. In the end, there was no
<br>result after four rounds of rotating restatement of static
<br>positions. Former UN Personal Envoy Peter Van Walsum cited
<br>immovable Moroccan commitment to retain sovereignty, and
<br>called the prospect of independence unrealistic. For this
<br>unusual frankness, the UN let Van Walsum go, at Algerian and
<br>Polisario insistence.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) The new Personal Envoy, Ambassador Christopher Ross,
<br>long one of the stars of U.S. diplomacy in the region, seems
<br>better positioned than anyone to budge President Bouteflika
<br>and his government. In recognition, he was granted the
<br>additional mandate to help improve Moroccan-Algerian
<br>relations. King Mohammed VI took note of this and conveyed
<br>through Ross an offer of unconditional, at-any-level and
<br>on-any-subject, bilateral talks. Ross did get Algeria to
<br>agree to go to the &informals8 but only as observers. He
<br>got no response on the bilateral issue, although it is still
<br>early in Bouteflika,s new term. The informal meeting this
<br>month in Vienna has at least re-launched the negotiations.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>Regional Link: Algeria-Morocco Key to Sahara Solution
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) Algeria and Morocco are demographically similar but
<br>with differences in historical experience that go back
<br>hundreds of years. About a year after Algeria,s hard-won
<br>independence, it and Morocco fought &The War of the Sands,8
<br>over their then-disputed frontier, drawn by colonial France.
<br>In 1975, when the Algerians sheltered the Polisario, it was
<br>at least as much a reflection of their historical rivalry as
<br>ideological support for a fellow liberation movement. King
<br>Hassan II managed to work out a frontier agreement with the
<br>Algerians which the GOM maintains has been ratified, and
<br>needs only an exchange of instruments of ratification. The
<br>subsequent closure of the Algeria-Moroccan border is now an
<br>anomaly in a Mediterranean region of growing links. There
<br>have been modestly growing functional links in recent years,
<br>much of it under Arab Maghreb Union auspices and in 2008 some
<br>technical agreements were signed. But direct high-level
<br>communication remains cut and both quiet and public GOM
<br>overtures to reopen it have been rebuffed. The Government of
<br>Algeria (GOA) turned down then-Secretary Rice,s invitation
<br>for a trilateral ministerial meeting on the margins of the
<br>2008 UNGA.
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) Algeria, Morocco and the Western Sahara dispute is a
<br>chicken and egg situation. Algeria has indicated relations
<br>cannot improve until there is self-determination in Western
<br>Sahara. Morocco, following the close links between the
<br>Polisario leadership and their Algerian hosts, remains
<br>convinced that there will be no agreement if relations with
<br>Algiers do not improve. In response, as of June 2009, the
<br>Moroccans have maintained that their principal goal now is
<br>rapprochement with Algeria, which could be discussed
<br>separately.
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) The international community is ready to support
<br>Maghreb rapprochement and integration, which can only occur
<br>in parallel with a settlement of the longstanding dispute
<br>over the Western Sahara and resettlement of the
<br>long-suffering refugees. Then-President Putin of Russia
<br>urged Algerian-Moroccan compromise in vain, as have the
<br>French, the Spanish, and the USG. We are not aware of any of
<br>the P-5 opposing an autonomy-based solution, nor have we seen
<br>real urgency or priority for the international community to
<br>resolve a dispute over which there has been no real fighting
<br>for 18 years. End Comment.
