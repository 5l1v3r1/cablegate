<br>Classified By: DCM Tom Kelly for reasons b, d.
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: With a seven-week period of bilateral
<br>estrangement in our rear-view window, we have an opportunity
<br>-- again -- to build a more constructive relationship with
<br>Argentina. The warming trend in the bilateral relationship
<br>continues. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her
<br>government rolled out the red carpet for CODEL Engel and
<br>PDDNI Kerr, and the circle of GOA luminaries making positive
<br>statements about the United States is growing. Capitalizing
<br>on this opportunity, however, will be no easy task.
<br>Confidence must be rebuilt on our side and in Buenos Aires.
<br>The GOA must demonstrate its commitment to a constructive
<br>relationship, including through visits to the United States.
<br>But concerted effort is also needed from our side, including
<br>visits to Argentina by senior USG officials. The presence of
<br>authoritative USG officials here, and the attendant positive
<br>media coverage it creates, feed the Argentine need for
<br>attention, directly attacking one of the main causes of
<br>anti-Americanism here -- the perception that the USG does not
<br>care enough about Argentina. The hard work will be worth the
<br>effort if we can make a dent in anti-U.S. sentiment and
<br>influence Argentina to stay out of the Bolivarian camp.
<br>Making Argentina a more cooperative interlocutor and
<br>receptive audience for U.S. ideas is achievable. End Summary.
<br>
<br>An Austral Warming Trend
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Three weeks have passed since the GOA signaled an end
<br>to its bilateral squabble with the USG via a highly
<br>publicized meeting on January 31 betweQPresident Cristina
<br>Fernandez de Kirchner (CFK) and Ambassador Wayne. (The U.S.
<br>Ambassador is the only Chief of Mission who has been received
<br>privately by CFK; she has now received him three times since
<br>her inauguration.) The change in how the United States is
<br>treated and portrayed by Argentine authorities is striking.
<br>As we had agreed beforehand, CFK insiders followed the
<br>January 31 session with positive and conciliatory statements
<br>from Cabinet Chief Alberto Fernandez, Foreign Minister Jorge
<br>Taiana, and others. From January 31 on, the Argentines have
<br>given prominent positive public play to each event involving
<br>a USG visitor, including the two (CODEL Engel and PDDNI) that
<br>occurred in the last week.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The chorus of anti-U.S. recriminations has fallen
<br>silent. In their place, we are hearing positive
<br>pronouncements about our country. On February 20, for
<br>example, after a meeting between the Ambassador and Minister
<br>of Defense Garre, a hold-over from the first Kirchner
<br>administration who had previously resisted close cooperation
<br>with the USG, the Defense Ministry issued an upbeat
<br>communique on its website noting that "the Argentine side
<br>expressed gratitude for American assistance." The statement
<br>then proceeded to detail several areas of successful
<br>bilateral cooperation that helped to train and transform
<br>Argentina's military.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In the wake of the meeting three weeks ago with CFK,
<br>the Ambassador has had friendly and productive meetings with
<br>Cabinet heavyweights such as Cabinet Chief Fernandez, MOD
<br>Garre, Foreign Minister Taiana, Economy Minister Lousteau,
<br>and Justice Minister Anibal Fernandez (reftels A-E).
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) More importantly, CFK herself has demonstrated her
<br>continuing personal interest in ties with the USG by hosting
<br>two meetings in her presidential office at the Casa Rosada
<br>with U.S. visitors in rapid succession: a positive,
<br>well-covered session with CODEL Engel on February 21, and
<br>PDDNI Kerr, who had a productive meeting with her on February
<br>¶25. Privately, Rep. Engel described the CODEL's 90-minute
<br>
<br>meeting with CFK as "a home-run." The meeting was covered
<br>intensively by the media, which characterized the event as a
<br>"Gesture of Detente" and "Improvement in Bilateral Relations"
<br>in leading daily headlines. PDDNI Kerr's meeting was equally
<br>positive. CFK warmly thanked him for his "important" visit,
<br>and repeated several times her commitment to the struggle
<br>against terrorism (saying, for example, that her government
<br>was "strongly committed to fight terrorism at home and
<br>internationally" and that her commitment to counter-terrorism
<br>was "absolute").
<br>
<br>Argentina Is In Play
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The about-face is striking, because it comes on the
<br>heels of a coordinated GOA effort, with the Kirchners and
<br>other GOA all-stars front and center, to impugn the motives
<br>of the United States in the Miami prosecution of Venezuelan
<br>agents connected to the matter of Guido Alejandro
<br>Antonini-Wilson's cash-filled suitcase. But the rhetorical
<br>course-correction is not surprising. CFK spent much of the
<br>latter half of 2007 telegraphing her intention to pursue
<br>closer relations with the United States, holding three
<br>meetings with Ambassador Wayne and spending a week in New
<br>York City wooing investors and the media, as well as meeting
<br>A/S Shannon. Just days before her inauguration, in a meeting
<br>with the Ambassador, CFK expressed her admiration for the
<br>United States and her desire to improve the bilateral
<br>relationship. Her Cabinet Chief Fernandez and new Ambassador
<br>to the United States Timerman argue forcefully that she wants
<br>to change past GOA practices and maintain good relations with
<br>the USG.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Clearly, there is still hard work to be done to build
<br>mutual confidence and establish a basis for sustained "good"
<br>relations. To maintain and reinforce the recent positive
<br>momentum, we need more engagement, not less -- by both sides.
<br>The GOA certainly needs to demonstrate its commitment to
<br>this effort. But it is important to remember that we also
<br>have much to gain if things go well.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The foreign policy orientation of the fledgling CFK
<br>government is very much in play. Moreover, in our view, the
<br>prevailing winds in the region favor our efforts to help
<br>Argentina evolve into a constructive partner. Hugo Chavez
<br>(whom CFK will visit in early March to ink an oil-for-food
<br>deal -- septel) is being portrayed in the local media as
<br>increasingly on the defensive, and Fidel Castro's withdrawal
<br>from the Cuban political scene is being covered here as the
<br>end of a radical era. In contrast, neo-left politicians like
<br>Lula (who just visited Buenos Aires to sign a number of
<br>bilateral agreements) and Chile's Michelle Bachelet are
<br>well-regarded here as pragmatic leaders who are making
<br>progress on social justice while maintaining good relations
<br>with Washington. We read the tea leaves to indicate that CFK
<br>much prefers to follow Lula's path than Chavez's, and wants
<br>to diversify Argentina's good relations in the world.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) At the same time, there are countervailing forces that
<br>could push the new president in another direction.
<br>Influential figures within her government, such as Planning
<br>Minister Julio de Vido, espouse a close embrace of Chavez's
<br>Bolivarian project. Although de Vido's primary motive for
<br>tilting towards Chavez may be pecuniary, a Bolivarian
<br>approach to foreign policy would sit well with CFK's poor and
<br>working class political constituency, and probably appeal at
<br>a certain level to the Peronist/populist instincts of CFK and
<br>her husband. Nestor Kirchner himself was never as
<br>comfortable with the United States as his wife has proven to
<br>be. For example, he never received this Ambassador or
<br>publicized contacts with us, whereas CFK has met the
<br>Ambassador six times and played each meeting positively and
<br>prominently in the media. While Nestor Kirchner is still a
<br>powerful decision-maker, he is by most reports ceding foreign
<br>policy to CFK.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In our view, the government's left-leaning,
<br>nationalistic heritage does not necessarily lead to chronic
<br>
<br>confrontation with the United States. CFK seems more
<br>interested in governance and the longevity of her family's
<br>political prospects than in gratuitous Yankee-bashing.
<br>Without U.S. engagement, however, our opportunity to develop
<br>a more constructive relationship with Argentina could be
<br>squandered. We need to stay on the field to win the game.
<br>
<br>Why Visits Help Educate and Show Interest
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Engagement means, among other things, senior-level
<br>visits in both directions. This is true for symbolic and
<br>practical reasons. Like other geographically isolated
<br>countries, Argentines keep track of who visits them and who
<br>doesn't. The GOA's infatuation with the travel plans of
<br>Assistant Secretary Shannon reflects a deep-seated,
<br>society-wide insecurity about Argentina's relative importance
<br>in the world. Argentines obsess over the perceived
<br>indifference of other countries to their interests and
<br>concerns, especially that of the United States. Visits to
<br>the region by senior USG officials that seem to hopscotch
<br>over Argentina are always noted in the press and the
<br>corridors of power.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) CFK clearly shares this fixation. She told the
<br>Ambassador late last year that she faults the USG for not
<br>paying sufficient attention to Latin America (read:
<br>Argentina) over the past few years, and repeated that
<br>analysis to CODEL Engel on February 21 (ref F). This is not
<br>new, or confined to CFK and her constituency. It is a widely
<br>shared perception in Argentina that the United States has
<br>only rarely sustained positive interest in the Southern Cone.
<br>(At a recent lunch with prominent local analysts,
<br>businesspersons, and media figures for PDDNI Kerr, this was a
<br>recurrent theme -- and none of them were government
<br>supporters.) High-level visits can be used to demonstrate
<br>our good intentions and sincere desires for stronger
<br>relations. For example, Secretary Chao's December visit to
<br>CFK's inauguration helped us to rebut accusations of a U.S.
<br>conspiracy against the GOA during the furor over the Miami
<br>court case.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Just as importantly, visits help GOA officials to
<br>learn. CFK and her husband know little about the way that
<br>our society and political system function. This holds true
<br>for most of their closest advisors and the Argentine
<br>political establishment writ large as well. The recent
<br>bilateral crisis, for example, reminded us how few of them
<br>(including those in the "pro-U.S." camp) really understand
<br>the extent of our justice system's independence. To our
<br>great advantage, Argentina is now headed by a President who
<br>wants to learn more about our country -- evinced, for
<br>instance, by the manner in which she pumps visitors for
<br>information about the U.S. presidential race. (Though she
<br>initially favored another woman candidate, it was clear by
<br>February 21 that she had absorbed much about all three
<br>leading candidates, and in both of her meetings with USG
<br>visitors in recent days she made positive comments about all
<br>three and about the vitality of our electoral process.)
<br>Alberto Fernandez told the Ambassador that he recently
<br>recommended that CFK accept Gordon Brown's invitation to
<br>travel to London for a gathering of international political
<br>party leaders precisely because it would be an excellent
<br>opportunity for her to learn more about the global scene
<br>through direct contact with other world leaders.
<br>
<br>The Most Promising Areas of Focus
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) On the practical level, despite this Mission's
<br>renewed access to every level of the Argentine government,
<br>there are a number of concrete policy areas in which
<br>Washington-based agencies and their leaders need to engage,
<br>including via the personal contact that visits make possible:
<br>
<br>
<br>-- (C) Finance: Achievement of a closer economic
<br>relationship, which CFK has told us she wants, will not
<br>
<br>happen without a Paris Club deal to normalize the GOA's debt
<br>to official creditors. That in turn will require Treasury's
<br>engagement with CFK's capable young Economy Minister Martin
<br>Lousteau. A Paris Club deal would be a critical first step
<br>towards an economically resurgent Argentina's broader
<br>reinsertion into global capital markets. This, in turn, will
<br>lessen Argentina's reliance on Venezuela to help place new
<br>Argentine debt, a reliance that comes with Bolivarian
<br>political and ideological strings attached. It could also
<br>help Lousteau, who is engaged in an internal tug-of-war with
<br>less market-friendly forces on many issues critical to the
<br>500 U.S. companies doing business here, establish his primacy
<br>within the GOA on economic policy.
<br>
<br>-- (C) Defense Cooperation: The Ministry of Defense is more
<br>friendly to us now than it has been at any time since MOD
<br>Garre took office two years ago. The Army chief, who
<br>previously kept his distance from the United States, has
<br>reached out to us for contact. Argentina's Navy and Air
<br>Force are eager to work with us. To capitalize on this
<br>attitudinal shift, we need high-profile U.S. military leaders
<br>like Southcom Commander Stavridis (scheduled to visit in May)
<br>to come to Argentina. His visit could help us bring the
<br>military relationship to another level, advancing the ball on
<br>issues like Argentine participation in exercises, exchanges,
<br>and regional security cooperation. Such a visit could also
<br>keep U.S. military suppliers in the race for important
<br>contracts like 3-D radars. MOD U/S Forti told the Ambassador
<br>last week that he hopes to get MOD Garre to the United States
<br>in the months ahead.
<br>
<br>-- (C) Law Enforcement and Intelligence: Cooperation in this
<br>area was a bright spot in the bilateral relationship, even
<br>during the most difficult periods of the first Kirchner
<br>administration. The worrying freeze in cooperation that took
<br>place during the period of estrangement is over, and our
<br>cooperation is returning to normal. We need senior-level
<br>visits, such as the planned trip by Deputy FBI Director
<br>Pistole in May, to advance U.S. interests in intensified
<br>counter-terrorism work, and to resume our valuable
<br>partnership with the GOA to bring the Iranian-sponsored
<br>perpetrators of the 1994 AMIA bombing to justice. We also
<br>need to get leading GOA law enforcement officials to the
<br>United States for bilateral consultations.
<br>
<br>-- (S) Intelligence: Argentine intelligence officials highly
<br>value their relationship with U.S. counterparts, as PDDNI
<br>Kerr's visit amply demonstrated. During a dinner with the
<br>PDDNI February 23, the GOA's Deputy Director of Intelligence
<br>recounted with pride that his service has shared high-value
<br>information with us and worked closely with us in support of
<br>U.S. goals. The PDDNI's visit reinforced our superb working
<br>relationship with Argentina's service (the National
<br>Intelligence Service -- SIDE), and we need to keep developing
<br>it through continued cooperation.
<br>
<br>-- (SBU) Science and Technology: CFK has repeatedly cited
<br>this as an area where she hopes to expand contact and
<br>cooperation with the United States.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Visits by high-level U.S. and GOA officials to each
<br>other's country on these and other areas will advance our
<br>long-term interest in a friendly relationship with a
<br>populous, fast-growing country with considerable talent and
<br>resources. As importantly, such travel advances key U.S.
<br>interests in specific policy areas -- normalization of
<br>financial relationships between developing economies and
<br>creditors, amicable military-to-military ties, and
<br>cooperation on regional counter-terrorism issues -- that
<br>matter to our country's security interests.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Finally, travel by prominent USG and GOA officials to
<br>each other's countries directly addresses one of the main
<br>causes of anti-Americanism here -- the perception that the
<br>USG does not care enough about Argentina. The positive media
<br>coverage created by such visits makes Argentines at all
<br>levels of society feel relevant in the world and taken into
<br>considerations by our powerful country. This cannot help but
<br>
<br>chip away at this society's collective animus towards out
<br>nation, which stems to a large extent from its collective
<br>insecurity about itself.
<br>
<br>Let's Make It Work
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Events over the past two years remind us that
<br>relations with the GOA are not easy. Nonetheless, we have a
<br>real opportunity to reach a more positive equilibrium in the
<br>bilateral relationship. In his January 31 meeting with CFK,
<br>the Ambassador deployed Department-cleared talking points
<br>that featured the proposal that both sides would demonstrate
<br>interest in the relationship by engaging each other,
<br>including via visits in each direction. As reported in ref
<br>A, CFK agreed, and expressed interest in a steady stream of
<br>high-level visits. We therefore have a deal in place with
<br>the GOA on travel in both directions. The Argentines need to
<br>hold up their end of the bargain. Cabinet Chief Fernandez
<br>told the Ambassador February 21 that he had identified March
<br>8-12 for travel to the United States. Foreign Minister
<br>Taiana, MOD Garre, and Economy Minister Lousteau also intend
<br>to travel to the United States soon. We should remain
<br>committed to our part in this effort, especially after
<br>several weeks of positive interaction with the GOA.
