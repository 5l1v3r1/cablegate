<br>SUBJECT: GENERAL PETRAEUS' MEETING WITH EGIS CHIEF SOLIMAN 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. CAIRO 1227 
<br>     ¶B. CAIRO 746 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey per 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  Key Points: 
<br> 
<br>-- (S/NF) During a June 29 meeting with CENTCOM Commander 
<br>General Petraeus, Egyptian General Intelligence Service 
<br>(EGIS) Chief Omar Soliman shared his views on Iraq, Iran, and 
<br>ongoing efforts on Palestinian reconciliation. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S/NF) On Iraq, Soliman assessed that Arab leaders were 
<br>taking a "new position" on supporting Iraqi Prime Minister 
<br>Maliki following the Iranian elections and described Egypt's 
<br>plans to increase cooperation with the Iraqi government. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S/NF)  Soliman believed that the Iranian elections and 
<br>Hezbollah's electoral defeat in Lebanon presented a "good 
<br>opportunity" to reduce Iranian regional interference, 
<br>including by improving Syria's relations with the Arab world. 
<br> 
<br>-- (S/NF)  On Palestinian reconciliation, Soliman was 
<br>pessimistic that an agreement would be reached, but promised 
<br>that Egypt would "not give up" and would continue efforts to 
<br>undermine Hamas, including by preventing money and guns from 
<br>entering Gaza. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>Iraq: Extending an Arab Hand 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Soliman said Arab countries were looking for ways 
<br>to support Prime Minister Maliki during this "crucial time" 
<br>for Iraq.  General Petraeus thanked Egypt for supporting the 
<br>Iraqi government, including by nominating a new Ambassador to 
<br>Iraq (ref A) and encouraging other Arab countries to "hold 
<br>out a hand in friendship."  On President Mubarak's 
<br>instructions, Soliman explained, Egypt plans to increase 
<br>cooperation with Iraq on a wide variety of political, 
<br>security, and economic issues. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Soliman assessed that Arab leaders were taking a 
<br>"new position" on Iraq following the Iranian presidential 
<br>elections.  He believed that Iranian leaders would "change 
<br>their attitude" towards neighboring countries and "supporting 
<br>terrorism" abroad, and would focus instead on domestic 
<br>issues.  Iran cannot afford to "challenge the international 
<br>community now," Soliman opined.  The challenge, Soliman 
<br>explained, was to "bring Iraq back to the Arab world" and 
<br>foster support for Maliki.  According to Soliman, President 
<br>Mubarak told King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia "not to search for 
<br>another man," but should instead accept Maliki as Iraq's 
<br>leader and support him. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>Iran: Elections Present Opportunity for Arabs 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Soliman stressed that Egypt suffers from Iranian 
<br>interference, through its Hezbollah and Hamas proxies, and 
<br>its support for Egyptian groups like Jamaatt al-Islamiyya and 
<br>the Muslim Brotherhood.  Egypt will confront the Iranian 
<br>threat, he continued, by closely monitoring Iranian agents in 
<br>Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, and any Egyptian cells. 
<br>Improving relations between Syria and the Arab world would 
<br>also undermine Iran's regional influence.  Soliman noted "a 
<br>little change" in Syria's attitude on engaging with the Arab 
<br>world, adding that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia shared this 
<br>view and planned to visit Damascus soon "to help change 
<br>Syria's attitude." 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Soliman anticipated that Hezbollah's recent defeat 
<br>in the Lebanese parliamentary elections would force the group 
<br>to "remain quiet for sometime" as they rebuild domestic 
<br>support and counter the perception that Hezbollah is a "tool 
<br>of outsiders." With Iran itself focusing on domestic issues, 
<br>he continued, it was a "good time to make changes" in Lebanon 
<br>and reduce Iran's influence.  Egypt will support a Saad 
<br>Hariri government and the Lebanese army, Soliman emphasized. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Soliman said that Iran heeded Egypt's warning 
<br>against meddling in domestic affairs (ref B) and supporting 
<br>groups like the Muslim Brotherhood. He received a "very 
<br>positive message" from Iran's intelligence chief indicating 
<br>that Iran would not interfere in Egypt.  Egypt planned to 
<br>"remain quiet inside Iran" for the time being, but would 
<br>continue to recruit agents who "will do what we ask," if Iran 
<br>insists on interfering in Egypt.  "We hope Iran will stop 
<br> 
<br>CAIRO 00001349  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>supporting Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood and other cells" 
<br>within Egypt Soliman said, "but if not - we are ready." 
<br>Soliman said Iranian President Ahmadinejad wanted to attend 
<br>the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) conference in Egypt July 
<br>11-16.  If he did attend, President Mubarak would meet with 
<br>him and clearly explain that Iranian interference in "Arab 
<br>issues" was unacceptable.  "We are ready for good relations 
<br>with Iran," Soliman noted, but only if Iran ceased 
<br>interfering and supporting terrorists in the region. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Because of domestic problems, Soliman believed that 
<br>Iran would seek better relations with the Arab world and 
<br>suspend its nuclear program for a period of time to avoid a 
<br>"war."  He also anticipated Iran would try to strike more of 
<br>a "balance" between supporting its Hezbollah and Hamas 
<br>"tools" and trying to build better relations with the Arabs. 
<br>Soliman expressed concern that Iranian influence in Iraq 
<br>would spread after the re-deployment of U.S. troops out of 
<br>Iraqi cities and the eventual drawdown.  General Petraeus 
<br>noted that 130,000 U.S. troops remain and that the drawdown 
<br>would be gradual.  He expressed confidence that Iranian 
<br>influence could be contained if Arab countries moved 
<br>aggressively to support Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>Palestinian Reconciliation, Israel 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Soliman explained that Egypt's three primary 
<br>objectives with the Palestinians were to maintain calm in 
<br>Gaza, undermine Hamas, and build popular support for 
<br>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.  On Gaza, Soliman said 
<br>Egypt worked closely with Israel to coordinate humanitarian 
<br>assistance shipments and was encouraging the Israelis to 
<br>allow more assistance into Gaza. Soliman said he was still 
<br>seeking a "tahdiya" (calm) agreement between Hamas and 
<br>Israel, but noted that Israel's lack of a Gaza strategy and 
<br>desire to keep Hamas under pressure made any agreement 
<br>difficult.  On undermining Hamas, Soliman said Egypt has 
<br>"stopped" money and arms from entering Gaza.  "Hamas feels 
<br>they are losing their capabilities," Soliman said, as they 
<br>are unable to re-arm using the tunneling network under the 
<br>Egypt-Gaza border.  The pressure, especially from Egypt's 
<br>success at dismantling Hamas' funding mechanism, may render 
<br>Hamas "more flexible" than before. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Palestinians must believe that Abbas is capable of 
<br>securing a Palestinian state, Soliman stressed.  He noted 
<br>recent positive developments in the West Bank, including 
<br>improvements in the Palestinian security forces and the 
<br>lifting of some Israeli roadblocks to facilitate commerce and 
<br>movement.  He expressed concern, however, that continued 
<br>settlement activity, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's 
<br>recent "radical" speech, and insufficient economic 
<br>development in Palestinian areas were undermining the chances 
<br>for resuming peace negotiations.  Soliman added that 
<br>President Mubarak may invite Nentanyahu and Abbas to Cairo if 
<br>efforts to re-start negotiations became "blocked." 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Soliman briefed General Petraeus on his efforts to 
<br>facilitate Palestinian reconciliation.  Reconciliation 
<br>remains elusive, he noted, as neither Hamas nor Fatah really 
<br>want an agreement.  The Palestinian factions were currently 
<br>in Cairo, he said, for discussions on releasing detainees. 
<br>Talks were at an impasse, however, as Hamas had suspended 
<br>reconciliation talks until Abbas released all Hamas detainees 
<br>in the West Bank, which Soliman said Abbas would never 
<br>accept.  Soliman also doubted that a reconciliation agreement 
<br>would be reached by July 7 as Egypt previously announced, and 
<br>anticipated that talks would be suspended for one-two months. 
<br> Despite the challenge and frustrations, Soliman promised 
<br>that Egypt would "not give up" on Palestinian reconciliation. 
<br> "It is hard," he continued, "but I am always optimistic.  I 
<br>consider myself a patient man, but I am loosing patience." 
<br> 
<br>------------------- 
<br>Syria, Yemen, Afpak 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S/NF)  Soliman hoped Syria would improve its 
<br>relationship with the Arab world and the U.S. and stop 
<br>serving as "Iran's lifeline" in the region.  He also stressed 
<br>that Syria must cooperate with Iraq to improve border 
<br>security and stem the flow of foreign fighters.  Soliman also 
<br>called on Syria to drop its insistence that the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be solved before Syria will 
<br>reach an agreement with Israel on the Golan Heights. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S/NF) Soliman expressed concern over instability in 
<br> 
<br>CAIRO 00001349  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Yemen and said Egypt was trying to help President Saleh, 
<br>including by providing information on Iranian and Qatari 
<br>support to the al-Houthi insurgents.  General Petraeus noted 
<br>U.S. efforts to improve Yemen's capacity to combat 
<br>extremists.  On Pakistan, General Petraeus said he was 
<br>encouraged by the Pakistani military's operations in the Swat 
<br>Valley and Northwest Frontier Province, including their focus 
<br>on holding and rebuilding effected areas.  Soliman credited 
<br>the Pakistani government for doing a better job of convincing 
<br>people that extremists pose a real threat to Pakistani 
<br>national security.  On Afghanistan, General Petraeus stressed 
<br>the importance of arresting the downward spiral of violence 
<br>and improving governance after the September 20 national 
<br>elections. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (U) General Petraeus cleared this cable.
