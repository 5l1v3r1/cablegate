<br>SUBJECT: Lame Duck German Governor Kicked Upstairs as New 
<br>Energy Commissioner in Brussels 
<br> 
<br>REF: Frankfurt 002808 
<br>Sensitive but unclassified; not for Internet Distribution. 
<br>¶1. (SBU) Chancellor Angela Merkel nominated Baden- 
<br>Wuerttemberg (BW) Minister President Guenther Oettinger as EU 
<br>Energy Commissioner primarily to remove an unloved lame duck 
<br>from an important CDU bastion.  The move was not the promotion 
<br>of a valued colleague as Merkel's allies sought to portray it. 
<br>Rather, Oettinger's increasing loss of party support in BW 
<br>compelled Merkel to push Oettinger out to protect her support 
<br>base there.  Oettinger is noted for a lackluster public 
<br>speaking style, and some commentators have asserted that 
<br>Merkel, who has often stood out at EU meetings, wanted to 
<br>appoint a German Commissioner who would not outshine her. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (SBU) Germany has a time-honored tradition of sending 
<br>unwanted politicians to the EU Commission, although departing 
<br>SPD EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen proved his 
<br>worth during his tenure.  Oettinger has criticized Merkel for 
<br>her policy stances (on federal support to Opel and on generous 
<br>subsidies to the former eastern states, for instance)  and her 
<br>purported lack of leadership while antagonizing other 
<br>influential CDU leaders.  In addition to being a poor public 
<br>speaker, he has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth.  The 
<br>best-known example was his ill-advised 2007 defense of a CDU 
<br>predecessor as an opponent of the National Socialist regime, 
<br>despite his documented pro-Nazi war record.  Nonetheless, 
<br>Oettinger is said by industry sources in Baden-Wuerttemberg to 
<br>be an efficient behind-the-scenes negotiator. 
<br>¶3. (U) Merkel was criticized for choosing the energy 
<br>portfolio, which many derided as too insignificant for 
<br>Germany.  Werner Langen, CDU/CSU caucus spokesman in the EU 
<br>Parliament, said the portfolio has "lost significance." 
<br>Prominent Green Member of the European Parliament, Reinhard 
<br>Buetikofer characterized it as "not particularly influential," 
<br>and Der Spiegel called it a "makeshift job."  The EU Energy 
<br>Commissioner is responsible for issues such as supply 
<br>security, energy R&D and efficiency, competition in the gas 
<br>and electricity markets, infrastructure and low carbon 
<br>technologies.  However, key issues such as energy security and 
<br>climate change are not in the portfolio; nor will Oettinger 
<br>take over the role of EU Commission Vice President from 
<br>Verheugen. 
<br>¶4. (U) Oettinger has an academic background in law and 
<br>economics and professional experience as a tax consultant and 
<br>accountant.  His political expertise is in media policy.  His 
<br>background in energy appears limited to public support for 
<br>nuclear power and the extension of power plant operating 
<br>licenses.  His pro-nuclear stance is in stark contrast to many 
<br>other German politicians, who support the phase out of nuclear 
<br>power.  This endears him to the EU, which is focused on 
<br>diversification of energy sources and does not exclude nuclear 
<br>energy.  Nuclear power plants supply most of BW's energy while 
<br>renewable energy and fossil fuels do not play a significant 
<br>role.  Oettinger has not expressed interest to date in energy 
<br>issues other than nuclear.  His priorities in his list 
<br>submitted to the EU Parliament in the run up to the January 
<br>hearings of the candidate Commission are reportedly vague. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (SBU) Parliamentarians, skeptical of several members of 
<br>the new Commission, are likely to display particular interest 
<br>in Oettinger's views on binding energy efficiency targets and 
<br>encouraging more competition in internal energy markets. 
<br>Although Germany has embraced a controversial domestic goal of 
<br>increasing energy efficiency by 20% by 2020, it has yet to 
<br>translate the EU energy efficiency directive into national 
<br>law.  Germany has also steadfastly opposed liberalization of 
<br>its power sector oligopoly (what Brussels calls "unbundling") 
<br>although individual German companies are slowly moving in that 
<br>direction.  Oettinger's stance on the internal energy market 
<br>will also be of particular interest to European 
<br>parliamentarians, who see France, and particularly French 
<br>power giant EdF, as a major barrier to opening up the market. 
<br>EdF is a major share-holder in BW regional energy supplier 
<br>ENBW, which operates the state's nuclear power plants -- and 
<br>with which Oettinger is known to have warm relations.
