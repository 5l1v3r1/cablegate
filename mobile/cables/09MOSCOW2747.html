<br>SUBJECT: RUSSIA:  POLISH PM SIKORSKI REOPENS OLD FIGHTS
<br>
<br>REF: A. MOSCOW 1397

<br>¶D. WARSAW 1122
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political MC Susan M. Elliott for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d
<br>).
<br>
<br>¶1.  (SBU) Russian media and officials are concerned with
<br>Polish FM Radoslaw Sikorski's November 4 comments to the
<br>Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
<br>In particular, they noted Sikorski's request for U.S. forces
<br>on the ground in Poland to "protect against Russian
<br>aggression" and his characterization that the recent
<br>"Zapad-2009" exercises were directed against Poland.  Some
<br>Russian officials were quick to point out that Sikorski's
<br>comments undermined not only improved Polish relations (Ref A
<br>and B), but harmed Russian-U.S. and Russian-NATO relations as
<br>well.
<br>
<br>¶2.  (SBU) While the Russian MFA has not yet issued a formal
<br>statement, FM Sergey Lavrov told the press that he did not
<br>believe that Sikorski had actually made the remarks.  Lavrov
<br>commented, however, that if proved true, "it throws me into
<br>deep astonishment because we had talked in a detailed manner
<br>about the problems that needed to be addressed in the context
<br>of European security."  Russian Permanent Representative to
<br>NATO Dmitry Rogozin called Sikorski's remarks "absurd" and a
<br>u-turn in Polish policy toward Russia and its engagement with
<br>NATO and Europe.  Duma International Relations Committee
<br>Chair Konstantin Kosachev told the press that Sikorski's
<br>statements "directly contradicted" the improvement in
<br>Russia-U.S. and Russia-NATO relations.
<br>
<br>¶3.  (S/NF) Unfortunately, the Polish government had seeded
<br>some of this Russian response through their sponsorship of
<br>and statements in support of the EU's Eastern Partnership
<br>Initiative (Ref C) and show of support to Georgia during the
<br>2008 Russia-Georgia War.  Further, the Polish MFA has
<br>established a Bureau of European Security, which Polish
<br>diplomats jokingly refer to as the "Office of Threats from
<br>the East."  According to XXXXXXXXXXXX diplomat XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>(PROTECT), who was recruited to work in this bureau while
<br>serving in Moscow, the Russian MFA threw this new moniker
<br>back at him during a meeting.  XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed to us that the
<br>only way the MFA could have known about the reference was to
<br>have been listening in on his phone conversations with Warsaw
<br>while he was interviewing for the job.
<br>
<br>¶4.  (C) Comment:  The GOR will take some time to digest
<br>Sikorski's comments, and evaluate whether or not to alter the
<br>current positive trend in bilateral relations.  Russia has
<br>many levers, including delaying the approval of a pending gas
<br>deal (Ref D).  Sikorski has given anti-western elements in
<br>Russia ammunition against improved Russian relations with
<br>NATO and even with the U.S.
