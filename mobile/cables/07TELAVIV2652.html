<br>SUBJECT: U/S BURNS' AUGUST 17 MEETING WITH ISRAELI MOSSAD 
<br>CHIEF MEIR DAGAN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones.  Reasons: 1.4 (b)(d). 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) In an August 17 meeting, Israeli Mossad Chief Meir 
<br>Dagan thanked Under Secretary Burns for America's support of 
<br>Israel as evidenced by the previous day's signing of an MOU 
<br>that provides Israel with USD 30 billion in security 
<br>assistance from 2008-2018.  Dagan provided his assessment of 
<br>the Middle East region, Pakistan and Turkey, stressing 
<br>Israel's (a) concern for President Musharraf's well-being, 
<br>(b) view that Iran can be forced to change its behavior, and 
<br>(c) sense that Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are 
<br>unstable with unclear futures ahead of them.  Dagan probed 
<br>for more detail about XXXXXXXXXXXX U.S. military assistance
<br>to the Gulf  states, and -- while signaling agreement with the
<br>U.S.  approach to the Gulf states vis-a-vis Iran -- cautioned that 
<br>they may not be able to absorb significant military  assistance.
<br>Dagan reviewed Israel's five-pillar strategy  concerning
<br>Iran's nuclear program, stressed that Iran is  economicall
<br> vulnerable, and pressed for more activity with  Iran's
<br>minority groups aimed at regime change.  Dagan urged 
<br>caution in providing assistance to the Siniora government in 
<br>Lebanon, noting Syrian and Iranian efforts to topple the GOL. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) Under Secretary Burns cited the MOU as tangible 
<br>evidence of the USG's commitment to Israel, and stressed that 
<br>the U.S. would support all of its friends -- Arabs included 
<br>-- in the Middle East, and will remain engaged in the region 
<br>for the long term.  He described U.S. efforts to support the 
<br>Musharraf and Karzai governments as they face opposition from 
<br>Al-Qaeda and the Taliban, and explained that the Gulf 
<br>Security Dialogue is meant to bolster Gulf states facing 
<br>threats from Iran.  The Under Secretary reviewed U.S. efforts 
<br>to isolate Iran and increase pressure on it, stressing that 
<br>the U.S. is currently focused on the diplomatic track.  He 
<br>shared USG thinking about the Siniora government in Lebanon, 
<br>and urged that the U.S. and Israel continue to consult on 
<br>Lebanon.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>THE SECURITY ASSISTANCE MOU AND ISRAEL'S QME 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S)  Dagan observed that the signing of the MOU on 
<br>security assistance could not have come at a better time, and 
<br>stressed that Israel appreciated America's support.  The 
<br>Under Secretary agreed about the timing, noting that the 
<br>U.S., Israel and like-minded countries were facing multiple 
<br>threats around the world, and that the Middle East is a very 
<br>dangerous region.  He said that the MOU serves as a concrete 
<br>reminder that the U.S. stands by its long-term security 
<br>commitments to its friends, and is ready to help them with 
<br>their needs.  The Under Secretary noted that the Middle East 
<br>is now at the heart of American interests.  Because Egypt 
<br>also plays a vital role in the region, the U.S. would also 
<br>renew its security assistance commitment to that country. 
<br>U.S. relations with the Gulf states were longstanding, and 
<br>America would stay true to those friendships, as well.  The 
<br>Under Secretary stressed that the USG is committed to 
<br>Israel's QME.  He noted that the majority of systems and 
<br>equipment that the U.S. would sell to Egypt and other Arab 
<br>partners would replace items that had been sold to those 
<br>countries in the past. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>DAGAN REVIEWS MIDDLE EAST, PAKISTAN, TURKEY 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) Assessing the region, Dagan said Israel sees itself in 
<br>the middle of a rapidly changing environment, in which the 
<br>fate of one Middle Eastern country is connected to another. 
<br>Dagan then said he was concerned about how long Pakistani 
<br>President Musharraf would survive:  "He is facing a serious 
<br>problem with the militants.  Pakistan's nuclear capability 
<br>could end up in the hands of an Islamic regime."  Turning to 
<br>Iran, Dagan observed that it is in a transition period. 
<br>There is debate among the leadership between Rafsanjani and 
<br>Ahmadinejad and their respective supporters.  Instability in 
<br>Iran is driven by inflation and tension among ethnic 
<br>minorities.  This, Dagan said, presents unique opportunities, 
<br>and Israelis and Americans might see a change in Iran in 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00002652  002 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>their lifetimes.  As for Iraq, it may end up a weak, federal 
<br>state comprised of three cantons or entities, one each 
<br>belonging to the Kurds, Sunnis and Shias. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) Dagan said that the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia are 
<br>concerned about the growing importance of Iran and its 
<br>influence on them.  They are taking precautions, trying to 
<br>increase their own military defensive capabilities. 
<br>Referring to the Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD), Dagan warned 
<br>that these countries would not be able to cope with the 
<br>amount of weapons systems they intend to acquire:  "They do 
<br>not use the weapons effectively." 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) Dagan said that Jordan has successfully faced down 
<br>threats from the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, and that Egypt 
<br>is struggling with the question of who will replace President 
<br>Mubarak.  He said he sees no hope for the Palestinians, and 
<br>that Israel looks at Syria and Lebanon, and sees only 
<br>instability.  Further afield, it looks at Turkey and sees 
<br>Islamists gaining momentum there.  The question, he asked, is 
<br>how long Turkey's military -- viewing itself as the defender 
<br>of Turkey's secular identity -- will remain quiet. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) If Israel's neighborhood were not unstable enough, 
<br>Dagan observed, it did not help that Russia is playing a 
<br>"very negative role" in the region.  He observed that all of 
<br>these challenges have to be addressed globally -- they could 
<br>not be dealt with individually.  Returning to Jordan as an 
<br>example, he noted that the more than one million Iraqi 
<br>refugees in Jordan were changing Jordanian society, and 
<br>forcing it into a new relationship with Saudi Arabia.  This 
<br>is evidenced by Saudi King Abdullah's recent visit to Jordan, 
<br>which implies greater understanding between the Jordanians 
<br>and the Saudis. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>DISCUSSION OF THE GULF SECURITY DIALOGUE 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) Turning to the Gulf Security Dialogue (GSD), Dagan 
<br>said that enhancing the capabilities of the Gulf states "is 
<br>the right direction to go," especially as they are afraid of 
<br>Iran.  Such a U.S. commitment will be a stabilizing factor in 
<br>the region.  Dagan clarified that he would not oppose U.S. 
<br>security assistance to America's Arab partners.  He expressed 
<br>concern, nevertheless, about the current policies of those 
<br>partners -- especially with regards to Syria and Iran.  Dagan 
<br>added that if those countries must choose between buying 
<br>defensive systems from the U.S. or France, then he would 
<br>prefer they buy systems from the U.S., as this would bring 
<br>them closer to the U.S. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) Dagan observed that the challenge facing the U.S. now 
<br>is how to unite the Gulf states under a shared policy, and 
<br>pointed to Qatar as the weakest link in the chain, trying to 
<br>play all sides.  Under Secretary Burns replied that the U.S. 
<br>is trying to get Qatar and its neighbors to look at issues 
<br>from a regional perspective, and to focus on threats in a 
<br>unified way.  Acting PM Assistant Secretary Mull expressed 
<br>understanding for Israel's frustration with how the region 
<br>looked, but stressed nevertheless that if America did not 
<br>engage the Gulf states through the GSD, the situation would 
<br>become much worse.  It is critical to get the Gulf states 
<br>focused on the Iran threat, and to adopt a regional approach 
<br>to countering it.  Encouraging and supporting their 
<br>counterproliferation efforts would be crucial.  Dagan said he 
<br>agreed with this approach, stressing that the threat of 
<br>radical Islam is real. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>IRAN: DAGAN REVIEWS ISRAEL'S FIVE PILLAR STRATEGY 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) Dagan led discussion on Iran by pointing out that the 
<br>U.S. and Israel have different timetables concerning when 
<br>Iran is likely to acquire a nuclear capability.  He clarified 
<br>that the Israel Atomic Energy Commission's (IAEC) timetable 
<br>is purely technical in nature, while the Mossad's considers 
<br>other factors, including the regime's determination to 
<br>succeed.  While Dagan acknowledged that there is still time 
<br>to "resolve" the Iran nuclear crisis, he stressed that Iran 
<br>is making a great effort to achieve a nuclear capability: 
<br>"The threat is obvious, even if we have a different 
<br>timetable.  If we want to postpone their acquisition of a 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00002652  003 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>nuclear capability, then we have to invest time and effort 
<br>ourselves." 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S) Dagan described how the Israeli strategy consists of 
<br>five pillars: 
<br> 
<br>A) Political Approach: Dagan praised efforts to bring Iran 
<br>before the UNSC, and signaled his agreement with the pursuit 
<br>of a third sanctions resolution.  He acknowledged that 
<br>pressure on Iran is building up, but said this approach alone 
<br>will not resolve the crisis.  He stressed that the timetable 
<br>for political action is different than the nuclear project's 
<br>timetable. 
<br> 
<br>B) Covert Measures: Dagan and the Under Secretary agreed not 
<br>to discuss this approach in the larger group setting. 
<br> 
<br>C) Counterproliferation: Dagan underscored the need to 
<br>prevent know-how and technology from making their way to 
<br>Iran, and said that more can be done in this area. 
<br> 
<br>D) Sanctions:  Dagan said that the biggest successes had so 
<br>far been in this area.  Three Iranian banks are on the verge 
<br>of collapse.  The financial sanctions are having a nationwide 
<br>impact.  Iran's regime can no longer just deal with the 
<br>bankers themselves. 
<br> 
<br>E) Force Regime Change:  Dagan said that more should be done 
<br>to foment regime change in Iran, possibly with the support of 
<br>student democracy movements, and ethnic groups (e.g., Azeris, 
<br>Kurds, Baluchs) opposed to the ruling regime. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S) Dagan clarified that the U.S., Israel and like-minded 
<br>countries must push on all five pillars at the same time. 
<br>Some are bearing fruit now; others would bear fruit in due 
<br>time, especially if more attention were placed on them. 
<br>Dagan urged more attention on regime change, asserting that 
<br>more could be done to develop the identities of ethnic 
<br>minorities in Iran.  He said he was sure that Israel and the 
<br>U.S. could "change the ruling regime in Iran, and its 
<br>attitude towards backing terror regimes."  He added, "We 
<br>could also get them to delay their nuclear project.  Iran 
<br>could become a normal state." 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S) Dagan stressed that Iran has weak spots that can be 
<br>exploited.  According to his information, unemployment 
<br>exceeds 30 percent nationwide, with some towns and villages 
<br>experiencing 50 percent unemployment, especially among 17-30 
<br>year olds.  Inflation averages more than 40 percent, and 
<br>people are criticizing the government for investing in and 
<br>sponsoring Hamas, saying that they government should invest 
<br>in Iran itself.  "The economy is hurting," he said, "and this 
<br>is provoking a real crisis among Iran's leaders."  He added 
<br>that Iran's minorities are "raising their heads, and are 
<br>tempted to resort to violence." 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S) Dagan suggested that more could be done to get the 
<br>Europeans to take a tougher stand against Iran.  Under 
<br>Secretary Burns agreed, and suggested that Israel could help 
<br> 
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>by reaching out to the Europeans.  Dagan said that Israel is 
<br>already doing this, and would continue to do so.  Dagan 
<br>reiterated the need to strike at Iran's heart by engaging 
<br>with its people directly.  Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts 
<br>are important, but more radio transmissions in Farsi are 
<br>needed.  Coordination with the Gulf states is helpful, but 
<br>the U.S. should also coordinate with Azerbaijan and countries 
<br>to the north of Iran, to put pressure on Iran.  Russia, he 
<br>said, would be annoyed, but it would be fitting, as Russia 
<br>appears bent on showing the U.S. that it cannot act globally 
<br>without considering Russia. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (S) Under Secretary Burns stressed that the USG is 
<br>focused on Iran not only because of its nuclear program, but 
<br>also because it supports terrorism and Shiite militias in 
<br>Iraq.  The U.S. approach is currently focused on the 
<br>diplomatic track and increasing pressure on Iran through 
<br>sanctions.  Work in the UNSC helps to define the Iranian 
<br>nuclear threat as one that affects international security, 
<br>and not just that of Israel.  While UNSC members Russia, 
<br>China and Qatar will water down efforts to increase pressure 
<br>on Iran, it is still worthwhile to push for a third sanctions 
<br>resolution.  In the meantime, the U.S. will encourage the 
<br>Europeans, Japan and South Korea to implement unilateral 
<br>sanctions against Iran outside the UNSC framework.  The U.S. 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00002652  004 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>will continue to encourage banks and financial institutions 
<br>to slow down their operations in Iran and financially isolate 
<br>it.  Regarding military pressure, the Under Secretary noted 
<br>that the U.S. has deployed 1-2 carrier battle groups in the 
<br>Gulf over the last six months, and that President Bush has 
<br>stated that he will interrupt Iran's activity in Iraq.  As 
<br>for outreach to the Iranian people, the VOA is now 
<br>broadcasting programs in Farsi, and the USG is trying to get 
<br>more Iranian students to visit the U.S. to promote 
<br>people-to-people relations. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>PAKISTAN:  ISRAEL WORRIED ABOUT MUSHARRAF 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (S) On Pakistan, Dagan said that President Musharraf is 
<br>losing control, and that some of his coalition partners could 
<br>threaten him in the future.  The key question, Dagan said, is 
<br>whether Musharraf retains his commander-in-chief role in 
<br>addition to his role as president.  If not, he will have 
<br>problems.  Dagan observed that there has been an increase in 
<br>the number of attempts on Musharraf's life, and wondered 
<br>whether he will survive the next few years.  Under Secretary 
<br>Burns replied that South Asia has assumed vital importance in 
<br>American foreign policy since September 11.  The U.S. is 
<br>committed to denying Afghanistan as a safe-haven for Taliban 
<br>and Al-Qaeda activity.  The USG will continue to support 
<br>Pakistani President Musharraf, and is seeking to boost his 
<br>military defensive capabilities.  At the same time, the U.S. 
<br>is encouraging Pakistan and Afghanistan to work with each 
<br>other militarily.  Turning to India, Under Secretary Burns 
<br>noted that U.S.-Indian economic cooperation is growing, and 
<br>that the USG is working effectively to reduce tensions 
<br>between India and Pakistan. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>LEBANON:  DAGAN URGES CAUTION 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (S) Dagan urged caution with respect to Lebanon, noting 
<br>that the results of efforts there to bolster the Siniora 
<br>government would impact Syria and Iraq.  The U.S. and Israel, 
<br>he said, are on the edge of achieving something in Lebanon, 
<br>and so cannot afford to drop their guard.  What is necessary 
<br>is finding the right way to support PM Siniora.  "He is a 
<br>courageous man," Dagan said.  Syria, Iran and Hizballah are 
<br>working hard against him.  Dagan noted that much of what is 
<br>animating the leadership of Lebanon to take on Syria is 
<br>personal:  "Hariri, Jumblat and others had their parents 
<br>executed by the Syrians."  This anti-Syrian sentiment has 
<br>forged an alliance based on personal and national interests. 
<br>Siniora has worked well with the situation, but Dagan 
<br>suggested that the odds are against him.  Under Secretary 
<br>Burns replied that the U.S. is trying to give PM Siniora as 
<br>much support as possible, and that we would continue to 
<br>consult closely with Israel on Lebanon.  He noted that he 
<br>would return to Israel in October.
