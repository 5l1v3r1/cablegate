<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Segolene Royal's overwhelming first-round 
<br>victory in the November 16 Socialist Party (PS) presidential 
<br>primary makes it official -- she will be the candidate of the 
<br>center-left in next year's presidential election, likely in a 
<br>tight race against the center-right's Nicolas Sarkozy. The 
<br>win is a testament to Royal's ability to confound France's 
<br>purveyors of conventional political wisdom and her own party 
<br>establishment. Both regularly underestimated her and 
<br>discounted her ability to go the distance. Royal's success 
<br>has been her ability -- as a Blair-like socialist -- to deal 
<br>with issues non-ideologically through the prism of their 
<br>impact on ordinary people, with a focus on concrete, 
<br>operational proposals that she is willing to jettison if they 
<br>prove unworkable. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) SUMMARY CONT. Royal has demonstrated these same 
<br>traits in the foreign affairs arena, where her recent 
<br>statements in support of the democratic government in Iraq 
<br>and against even a civilian nuclear program in Iran were met 
<br>with condescension by elites, but seem not to have hurt her 
<br>with PS voters. If she were to be elected President, we 
<br>would expect criticism of U.S. "unilateralism", environmental 
<br>policies, and more. But her years working in Mitterrand's 
<br>Elysee also portend an openness to pragmatic cooperation with 
<br>the U.S. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>THE PRIMARY ELECTION RESULTS 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>¶3. (C) On November 16, in an overwhelming vote of confidence 
<br>in her ability to win, over 60 percent of PS party members 
<br>endorsed Segolene Royal as their party's candidate in the 
<br>2007 presidential race. Of the 176,220 votes cast by PS 
<br>party members throughout metropolitan France, Royal received 
<br>106,839, former Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, 
<br>36,714 former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius 32,667. Ever 
<br>since Royal launched her bid for the presidency, France's 
<br>purveyors of conventional political wisdom have been 
<br>discounting her ability to go the distance. Royal has proved 
<br>them wrong each time. The Sarkozy camp now understands it 
<br>will be facing a formidable opponent, whom they would 
<br>underestimate at their own peril. Throughout the race, Royal 
<br>displayed the energy, conviction, charisma, and physical 
<br>stamina that have made her a leading contender to be elected 
<br>France's next president. 
<br>
<br>A FIFTY PERCENT CHANCE OF BEING FRANCE'S 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>NEXT PRESIDENT 
<br>-------------- 
<br>¶4. (C) Royal's clear-cut victory in the first-round of the 
<br>PS primary election confirms her as the unchallenged leader 
<br>of the center-left in France. It sets up a showdown between 
<br>her and Interior Minister Sarkozy for France's presidency in 
<br>¶2007. Analysts agree that if the dominance of the 
<br>presidential field by these two major candidates holds, the 
<br>second round run-off between them will be very, very close. 
<br>Though the unexpected -- including major missteps by these 
<br>leading candidates during their campaigns -- could still 
<br>reconfigure the electoral landscape, dislodging one or the 
<br>other becomes more and more difficult as the election draws 
<br>nearer. 
<br>
<br>FUSING HER POPULARITY (AND HER CURRENT 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>ORGANIZATION) WITH HER PARTY 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>¶5. (C) Royal's primary victory gives her allies in the PS 
<br>unchallenged control of the party apparatus. Party chief 
<br>Francois Hollande, who is also Royal's long-time domestic 
<br>partner, will be instrumental in putting the party fully in 
<br>the service of Royal's campaign. The next step for Royal is 
<br>"making the party headquarters my campaign headquarters." 
<br>According to one of her closest allies in the party 
<br>hierarchy, her campaign strategy projects two key lines of 
<br>action: "continuing to be what has made her popular," while 
<br>bringing to bear the party's electioneering expertise and 
<br>energizing the party's dense network of elected officials 
<br>throughout the country. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Royal's upcoming campaign will continue to feature 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00007424 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>the personal characteristics on which her popularity is 
<br>founded, while also working to improve some of her weaknesses 
<br>as a candidate. She has shown a vulnerability to getting 
<br>rattled during TV appearances or before hostile publics. 
<br>Because she has not had top-level experience in some issue 
<br>areas, particularly foreign affairs, deepening her command of 
<br>these briefs will be a top priority. 
<br>
<br>THE CORE OF THE "SEGOLENE PHENOMENON" 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>¶7. (C) PS Party spokesman and long time Royal ally Julian 
<br>Dray recently enumerated to us the four personal 
<br>characteristics that make Royal so popular. They are the key 
<br>elements of "the Segolene story" that connects so powerfully 
<br>with such a wide electorate. 
<br>-- First, "She's a mom." Royal has raised four children with 
<br>Hollande. That experience, according to Dray, "gives 
<br>ordinary people confidence" that she might be genuinely 
<br>caring towards them also -- very different from the 
<br>subliminal sentiments towards ordinary people associated with 
<br>members of France's aloof and inbred political class. 
<br>-- Second, "She has a successful marriage." Even though 
<br>Royal and Hollande have never legally married, their 
<br>long-standing relationship is viewed as an exemplary "success 
<br>in love" -- and people admire that, wishing for the same in 
<br>their own lives. 
<br>-- Third, "She's a beautiful woman." This element of novelty 
<br>and of gender equality -- with a touch of feminist revanchism 
<br>in an electorate that is 53 percent female thrown in -- are 
<br>part and parcel of Royal's success. 
<br>-- Finally, "She's highly competent." Royal has 
<br>distinguished herself through her professional achievements. 
<br>Her rise -- notwithstanding her family's modest means and 
<br>very traditionalist social values (i.e. women become wives, 
<br>not presidents) -- through France's witheringly competitive 
<br>educational meritocracy, are recognized by voters as those of 
<br>an extraordinary individual, worthy of consideration for 
<br>France's highest office. 
<br>
<br>CRITICAL OF U.S. APPROACH, YET OFTEN 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>STILL IN SYNCH ON SUBSTANCE 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>¶8. (C) Royal, as is to be expected from the standard bearer 
<br>of France's center-left Socialist Party, can be quite direct, 
<br>even harsh in her assessments of U.S. foreign policy 
<br>initiatives. As is the case nearly across the board -- left 
<br>and right -- among the members of France's political class, 
<br>Royal has made clear that she opposed the U.S.-led invasion 
<br>of Iraq in 2003, and what she saw as the high-handed U.S. 
<br>dismissal of multilateral, UN-led efforts to defuse the 
<br>crisis. However, in some of her more recent statements on 
<br>Iraq, Royal has clearly broken with the conventional wisdom 
<br>in France, particularly that of the French left. After a 
<br>meeting with Iraqi president Jalal Talibabi in Paris last 
<br>November 3, Royal told reporters that, despite all the 
<br>problems there, Iraq "is getting back on its feet." She 
<br>underlined that the Iraqi government, "not outsiders" should 
<br>decide "when the time has come" for withdrawal of foreign 
<br>forces from the country. Reflecting her penchant for seeing 
<br>war and peace problems in terms of their effect on the lives 
<br>of everyday people first (rather than in terms of balance of 
<br>power among states, regional stability, etc.), Royal stressed 
<br>the importance of "a swift reconstruction of that country, 
<br>which was so ravaged by dictatorship, so that the Iraqi 
<br>people who have suffered so so much (emphasis hers) might 
<br>recover their dignity and their self-confidence, and desire 
<br>to get back on the road to success." 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Repeatedly, in her pronouncements on international 
<br>issues, Royal has insisted on the legitimacy and pre-eminence 
<br>of the U.N. in acting against threats to international peace 
<br>and security. Royal's statements on the conflict in Lebanon 
<br>last summer, for example, reflected the view that ending the 
<br>suffering of the conflict's civilian casualties (on both 
<br>sides) should be the first priority, addressed by an 
<br>immediate cease-fire, to be followed by UN-mediated 
<br>disengagement, and the disarming of Hezbollah. In addition, 
<br>she proposed that former President Clinton be considered as a 
<br>special UN mediator for the conflict. A Royal advisor 
<br>pointed to this proposal as illustrative of her inclination 
<br>to personalize political issues. Royal's reaction to the 
<br>Israel-Hezbollah confrontation -- seeing the crisis first and 
<br>foremost through the prism of its impact on ordinary people, 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00007424 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>while advocating the empowerment of the UN to seek a 
<br>longer-term solution -- reflect what is likely to be Royal's 
<br>approach to international conflicts. In Dray's words, spoken 
<br>as a close friend of Royal's for many years, "She's not 
<br>interested in the theory, and approaches problems in terms of 
<br>what's being proposed to solve them." If true, this would 
<br>certainly represent a refreshing break from the ingrained 
<br>French preference for the theoretical over the empirical. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In her recent statements specifically about the 
<br>U.S., Royal has not been shy about criticizing what she has 
<br>repeatedly termed the "attitude" of the U.S. -- America's 
<br>willingness to act outside of the consensus of the 
<br>international community. Royal's America-bashing however, 
<br>concerns more the form of U.S. policy than its substance. In 
<br>fact, to the extent she has expressed herself on them, her 
<br>views on some key issues are in fact quite close to those of 
<br>the U.S. A striking example of this is the way Royal has 
<br>been the most outspoken of France's major political figures 
<br>about the danger posed by Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. 
<br>She has spoken explicitly about the threat to Israel's 
<br>existence of nuclear weapons in the hands of the current 
<br>Iranian leadership, and has gone so far as to suggest that 
<br>Iran's civil nuclear program, because it is a stepping-stone 
<br>to a weapons program, is illegitimate in light of Iran's 
<br>reneging on its non-proliferation obligations. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>¶11. (C) If elected -- and that is a big if that is still a 
<br>long way down the road -- Royal appears to be someone who 
<br>would approach world affairs pragmatically and would seek to 
<br>maintain a close, if critical, relationship with the U.S. 
<br>There may be a fresh opportunity for Washington policy makers 
<br>to take her measure if, as we know her staff is considering, 
<br>she goes through with plans to visit the U.S. at some point 
<br>before the end of January, when the presidential campaign 
<br>begins in earnest. End Comment.
