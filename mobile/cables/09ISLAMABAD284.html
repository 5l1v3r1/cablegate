<br>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT ZARDARI DISCUSSES AQ KHAN RELEASE
<br>
<br>REF: (A) ISLAMABAD 267 (B) ISLAMABAD 280
<br>
<br>Classified By: Anne  W. Patterson for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: President Zardari assured the Ambassador on
<br>February 8 that A.Q. Khan would remain under house arrest and
<br>not engage with the media. Minister of Interior Rehman Malik
<br>also insisted that Khan would be prohibited from talking to
<br>the press and politicians, and his movements would be
<br>curtailed. Zardari and Malik speculated to the Ambassador
<br>that Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) party leader Nawaz
<br>Sharif was about to run A.Q. Khan for the Senate on his
<br>party,s slate. The Pakistani Government claims that they
<br>were trying to establish a legal basis for Khan,s detention,
<br>as he had been restrained previously by the Ministry of
<br>Defense "for his own security." However, the timinig of the
<br>court decision obviously took Zardari by surprise, reflecting
<br>the GOP,s persistent lack of coordination and message
<br>control. Now the government is trying to catch up. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) President Zardari assured the Ambassador on February 8
<br>that A.Q. Khan would not talk to the press and would remain
<br>under strict control. Ambassador conveyed that the release
<br>of A.Q. Khan, the world's most serious nuclear proliferator,
<br>aggravated by Khan,s press conference on his front lawn
<br>thanking Zardari and Interior Minister Rehman Malik for his
<br>release, was a very unfortunate signal to send to the world.
<br>For the United States, it was particularly unsettling coming
<br>on the eve of Ambassador Holbrooke,s visit and as the U.S.
<br>Congress considered assistance and trade bills for Pakistan.
<br>The U.S. was seeking a commitment that A.Q. Khan would stay
<br>out of the press and his movements would be restricted as
<br>before. Zardari argued that referring Khan,s detention to
<br>the Islamabad High Court was designed to prevent Khan from
<br>receiving a Senate ticket from PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif.
<br>"Where would I have been then?" Zardari said. Zardari said
<br>he would be sure that the police who were stationed at
<br>Khan,s house would not "pamper him."
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Minister of Interior Rehman Malik also reassured the
<br>Ambassador and DCM in several phone calls and meetings that
<br>A.Q. Khan would be kept under wraps; he would not talk to
<br>reporters or politicians, and his movements would be strictly
<br>controlled. Malik reported that President Zardari, who
<br>heard about the court decision from the Ambassador and then
<br>Pakistani Ambassador to the U.S. Haqqani and not his own
<br>ministers, had been annoyed about being blindsided. Malik
<br>told us that there had been no previous legal basis for the
<br>Khan detention. (Note. This is true. The head of
<br>Pakistan,s nuclear "Strategic Plans Division" Lt. General
<br>Kidwai has often told us that there was no legal basis for
<br>the Khan detention except to provide for his own security.
<br>End Note) Malik said repeatedly that the press conference
<br>had "gotten out of hand" and the press had rushed to Khan,s
<br>house even before the decision was announced. xxxxx End
<br>Note.)
<br>
<br>Media Reaction
<br>--------------
<br>¶4. (U) Unsurprisingly, Khan's press conference was widely
<br>covered by the electronic and print media. All papers ran Dr.
<br>Khan's "triumphant" photograph above the fold showing him
<br>waving to the media and public supporters at his residence.
<br>Stories included the international reaction with particular
<br>emphasis on the U.S., U.K., France, and India expressing
<br>"concern" about the decision and declaring Khan "a danger for
<br>world peace." Articles and editorials questioned how free
<br>Khan actually was and speculated on the contents of the
<br>secret Annex A. The Urdu press noted that "people came out on
<br>the roads, raised slogans in favor of Dr. Khan, and
<br>distributed sweatmeats." Urdu editorials unanimously praised
<br>the decision and protested the "Hue and Cry Over Release of
<br>Dr. Khan" (Islam), "Pakistan's Rejection of Charges of
<br>Nuclear Cooperation" (Jang), and "Maltreatment of Dr. A.Q.
<br>Khan at U.S. Behest Does not Befit Us" (Jang). Dr. Khan,s
<br>gratitude toward the Government of Pakistan was underscored
<br>in a widely reported quote that he is "grateful to the
<br>President, the Prime Minister, and the Interior Advisor
<br>Rehman Malik."

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) FM Qureshi and the MFA issued the official reaction
<br>for the GOP; their remarks were aimed at minimizing foreign
<br>reaction by repeating all that Pakistan has done to recover
<br>from Khan's misdeeds: dismantle his network, assist the IAEA,
<br>build up its export controls, and strengthen its nuclear
<br>security. Qureshi noted that the government maintains the
<br>right to appeal the court's decision. The English Daily
<br>Times editorial on Sunday argued that Khan's release will not
<br>make the government more popular and may cause problems with
<br>the international community. English language Dawn suggested
<br>the real proliferation problem was not Khan's network, but
<br>the discriminatory nature of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
<br>Treaty.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Comment: The Islamabad High Court is firmly under the
<br>control of the government, so it would appear that this was a
<br>planned move by some government element, probably Rehman
<br>Malik in a too clever by half move that was not coordinated
<br>with Zardari. Malik, who has aspirations to become Deputy
<br>Prime Minister (or even Prime Minister) often has good
<br>political judgment, but he failed badly this time. There was
<br>not even a hint publicly that Nawaz Sharif ever intended to
<br>nominate A.Q. Khan for a Senate seat. Moreover, the new court
<br>decision would not make Khan's nomination any less probable.
<br>This fiasco demonstrated yet another example of amateur,
<br>uncoordinated governance in Islamabad, and Nawaz will waste
<br>no time in exploiting this misstep. We will continue to
<br>monitor Khan's freedoms to determine if the GOP is
<br>implementing the restrictions that they promised to continue
<br>imposing on Khan.
