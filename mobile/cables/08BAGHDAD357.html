<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) This cable is the third update of Embassy Baghdad,s 
<br>implementation of the relevant eighteen recommendations of 
<br>the Secretary,s Panel on Protective Services. The following 
<br>recommendations have been implemented by Post (reftel D): 
<br>
<br>¶A. (C) Kennedy Recommendation 12 - Joint Review Board 
<br>¶B. (C) Kennedy Recommendation 17- Direct RSO Engagement with 
<br>GOI Police and Security Officials; 
<br>¶C. (C) Kennedy Recommendation 18 - RSO Response Team 
<br>Facilitation to Embassy Claims Program. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Embassy Baghdad has made significant progress on 
<br>recommendations 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 16 as outlined 
<br>in this cable. Recommendations 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 15 require 
<br>Department action. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) This cable also provides an update on the Department 
<br>of State-Department of Defense Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 
<br>on private security companies, proposed Iraqi legislation 
<br>concerning Coalition Provisional Authority Order 17, and 
<br>Embassy and Blackwater condolence payments in connection with 
<br>the September 16 incident. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>Recommendation 2 - DOD and DOS Discussions with GOI on New 
<br>Regulatory Framework for USG Private Security Contractors 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) STATUS: ONGOING. The legal status of DOD contractors, 
<br>including private security contractors, will be part of the 
<br>negotiations between the USG and the GOI on a Status of 
<br>Forces (SOFA) agreement expected to begin this month. The 
<br>Department of State will seek to obtain similar agreement on 
<br>immunities and related issues for DOS contractors separately. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>Kennedy Recommendation 4 ) Recommendation for Continued 
<br>Contract Services of Blackwater 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) STATUS: ONGOING. FBI investigation of the September 
<br>16 incident has not concluded. However, the Blackwater 
<br>contract expires in May 2008 and a decision on renewal may 
<br>have to be made before the FBI investigation concludes. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>Kennedy Recommendation 5 - RSO to be provided with DS Agents 
<br>Staffing to Accompany PPS Movements 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) STATUS: NEAR COMPLETION. Assistant Regional Security 
<br>Officers (ARSOs) and TDY DS Special Agents (SAs) are assigned 
<br>to command each Chief of Mission (COM) Personal Security 
<br>Detail (PSD) operating in the Baghdad area under the WPPS 
<br>contract. Fifty-two Special Agent positions and positions 
<br>related to the oversight of all DOS Private Security 
<br>Contractors (PSCs) in Iraq have been requested (reftel E) to 
<br>include RSO coverage of non-RSO Chief of Mission (COM) PSD 
<br>movements and coverage outside Baghdad. In late March, the 
<br>first group of approximately 12 new Special Agents will 
<br>arrive after completing training. This first group will be 
<br>assigned to Regional Embassy Offices (REOs) and the Regional 
<br>and Provincial Reconstruction Teams where DS has PSD 
<br>responsibilities. In the short term, Post continues to 
<br>maintain a staffing increase for this requirement through the 
<br>use of DS TDY personnel. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>Kennedy Recommendation 8 - Revisions to the Embassy Rules For 
<br>the Use of Force 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) STATUS: COMPLETED. The Baghdad Mission Firearms 
<br>Policy has been revised and issued. The Rules for the Use of 
<br>Force have been modified to make the language consistent with 
<br>the common principles outlined in the DOS-DOD MOA. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) To reduce the number of lethal force incidents, Post 
<br>has procured 24 Dazzlers. A Dazzler is a non-lethal 
<br>light-emitting weapon designed for use against perceived 
<br>vehicle threats as part of the graduated force response. On 
<br>
<br>February 20, instructors will initiate training to all PSD 
<br>teams on its proper application. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>Kennedy Recommendation 9 - Video Recording Equipment in 
<br>Vehicles and Recording of Radio Communications 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) STATUS: ONGOING/NEAR IMPLEMENTATION: DS Security 
<br>Engineering Officers (SEOs) are installing the approved 
<br>Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) system into PSD vehicles in 
<br>Baghdad. Each COM motorcade traveling into the Red Zone now 
<br>has at least one vehicle with a camera system installed. A 
<br>second installation team is arriving this week to continue 
<br>the installation. The entire project is scheduled to 
<br>continue through the spring with the short term goal of 
<br>having at least two vehicles in every motorcade operating 
<br>with cameras. Nearly 400 COM vehicles throughout Iraq will 
<br>have cameras installed upon the completion of the project. 
<br>Initial experience with the cameras has been very positive. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) IRM procured, built and tested a system that can 
<br>simultaneously record 32 radio channels. The system is in 
<br>the delivery stage. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>Kennedy Recommendation 10 - Vehicle Identification Numbering 
<br>System 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) STATUS: NO CHANGE. RSO has engaged MNF-I on this 
<br>issue and reviewed the operational security (OPSEC) concerns 
<br>with respect to readable vehicle number signage. It is the 
<br>collective assessment of the Embassy and MNF-I that a vehicle 
<br>numbering system is only viable if all USG PSDs adopt the 
<br>same numbering scheme and non-USG PSDs also agree to 
<br>voluntarily adopt the same system. MNF-I is not inclined to 
<br>support a numbering system solely for US Embassy Baghdad PSCs 
<br>as it may offer enemy forces the ability to identify them as 
<br>such and bring greater risk to COM movements. Post 
<br>recommends that this recommendation be reconsidered in light 
<br>of the extensive communications and de-confliction measures 
<br>that have been put into effect by RSO, MNF-I, and MNC-I which 
<br>are proving to be effective. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>Kennedy Recommendation 11 - Investigations and RSO Response 
<br>Unit 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) STATUS: ONGOING/NEAR COMPLETION. RSO has established 
<br>a Force Investigation Unit (FIU) consisting of a dedicated 
<br>FIU supervisor and ARSO. The FIU currently draws upon other 
<br>RSO personnel as needed. The PSD Serious Incident 
<br>Investigation Handbook is in the DS approval process. RSO 
<br>has requested Special Agent and contract investigator 
<br>resources to fully staff this unit to 14 persons. The FIU 
<br>will be responsible for the investigation of all serious 
<br>incidents involving DOS-affiliated PSCs to include Tier I and 
<br>Tier II private security contractors. Position descriptions 
<br>have been written and funding is being pursued. The first 
<br>meeting of the Embassy and MNFI Joint Incident Review Board 
<br>will be conducted on February 12. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>Kennedy Recommendation 13 - RSO AND MNF-I Procedures for 
<br>Coordination, Liaison, and Operational De-confliction 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) STATUS: AWAITING RSO LNO TO THE Multinational Corps 
<br>) Iraq (MNC-I)Joint Operations Center (JOC). RSO, MNF-I and 
<br>MNC-I have developed commonly agreed operational procedures, 
<br>liaison coordination and exchange of information, and a 
<br>process for swift resolution of issues of mutual interest. 
<br>RSO participates in the MNF-I Strategic Operations daily 
<br>briefing and presents data on planned COM protective missions 
<br>for the next 24 hours. An MNC-I liaison officer (LNO) was 
<br>added to the RSO TOC and has been fully integrated into the 
<br>RSO TOC's operations. The LNO provides enhanced visibility to 
<br>MNC-I on PSD movements outside the IZ and serves as the focal 
<br>point for coordination and situational awareness between RSO 
<br>and battle space owners in Baghdad. An RSO LNO has been 
<br>identified and will be assigned to the MNC-I Joint Operations 
<br>Center to enhance coordination between the Embassy and MNC-I. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>Kennedy Recommendation 14 ) PRC 152 Radios 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) The procurement of additional communication 
<br>capabilities is underway, with the arrival of the Harris PRC 
<br>152 handheld radio system expected by the end of February. 
<br>These radios give PSDs the ability to contact military units 
<br>
<br>directly in the field to de-conflict issues or request 
<br>medical evacuation and quick reaction forces. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>Kennedy Recommendation 16 - GOI-US Joint Commission Working 
<br>Group on PSC Licensing and Transparency 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) STATUS: ONGOING. The Embassy, represented by the 
<br>RSO, and the Multinational Forces ) Iraq (MNF-I), 
<br>represented by the Chief of the Contractor Policy and 
<br>Oversight Division (CPOD), continue to hold regular joint 
<br>working group meetings with the Chief, Private Security 
<br>Regulatory Division, Ministry of Interior, and his staff to 
<br>address topics of mutual concern. Four meetings have been 
<br>held to date. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>Completion of Negotiations on the DOS-DOD MOA on PSCs 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) on private security 
<br>companies, negotiated by the Embassy and MNF-I, was signed by 
<br>the Deputies for State and Defense on December 5, 2007. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>Embassy Condolence Payments Continue 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) On November 26, 2007, the Deputy Chief of Mission, 
<br>Acting RSO, and Acting Embassy Legal Adviser made condolence 
<br>payments to one Iraqi who had been injured and to the widow 
<br>and brother of an Iraqi who had been killed in the September 
<br>16 incident. All claimants accepted the payments. In 
<br>addition, the Iraqi who suffered an injury informed the DCM 
<br>that he had been punished for his absence at work when he was 
<br>recovering from his injury. The DCM apologized and offered 
<br>to write a letter to his employer explaining the cause of his 
<br>absence, which was provided to the claimant at a later date. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) On December 27, 2007, the Deputy Chief of Mission, 
<br>RSO, and Acting Embassy Legal Adviser made condolence 
<br>payments to three Iraqis who had been injured and the widow 
<br>of an Iraqi who had been killed in the incident. All 
<br>claimants accepted the payments. The Embassy is continuing 
<br>to work to obtain contact information for all of the 
<br>potential claimants from the September 16 incident and plans 
<br>to make additional payments in the future as it locates those 
<br>claimants. To date, the Embassy has paid 132,500 dollars to 
<br>claimants: 40,000 dollars to the families of 4 killed, 65,000 
<br>dollars to 13 injured, and 27,500 dollars to 11 claimants for 
<br>vehicle damage. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>Blackwater Condolence Payments 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) On January 18, 2007, the DCM and RSO met with 
<br>Blackwater representatives and were briefed on Blackwater,s 
<br>intentions to make condolence payments to the victims of the 
<br>September 16 Nisur Square incident and to obtain an operating 
<br>license from the Ministry of Interior. In a change from 
<br>Blackwater's previous position, the representatives said that 
<br>Blackwater has hired a number of Iraqi attorneys, including 
<br>one who has had significant experience dealing with MNFI on 
<br>Iraqi claims cases, to work with local courts on payment 
<br>issues and plans to follow procedures for payments as 
<br>determined by local laws and regulations. Blackwater has set 
<br>aside "a generous pot" of money for these payments and the 
<br>Iraqi attorneys will be contacting survivors and relatives of 
<br>the deceased. Representatives said that they intended to make 
<br>payments to all claimants, including those with lawsuits 
<br>pending in the United States, largely because they did not 
<br>expect those lawsuits to be successful. They also said that 
<br>they would take into account the specific requests and 
<br>circumstances of the claimants where possible. 
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) Blackwater is also moving ahead with efforts to 
<br>obtain an operating license from the Ministry of Interior 
<br>(MOI), and said that through their lawyers' communications 
<br>with the MOI they were told that Prime Minister Maliki would 
<br>approve the licensing of Blackwater if condolence payments 
<br>are made. They have received this same assurance from 
<br>members of the Ministry of Interior responsible for 
<br>licensing. 
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) The DCM told Blackwater that the Embassy believed it 
<br>was morally correct for Blackwater to make condolence 
<br>payments. She also indicated that while the Embassy welcomes 
<br>this action by Blackwater, it will not have any effect on the 
<br>DOS/Embassy decision on whether to retain Blackwater, and 
<br>that in regards to the MOI licensing issue, under no 
<br>circumstances could the Embassy approve of or in any way be 
<br>
<br>part of a bribery effort. The Blackwater representatives 
<br>indicated that they understood and that the process would be 
<br>straightforward and transparent. 
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) In follow-up communications with Blackwater, RSO 
<br>provided a list of all known victims and their available 
<br>contact information. As of January 31, Blackwater's Iraqi 
<br>attorneys had been able to contact family members of 6 of the 
<br>deceased victims, and 12 of the victims that had suffered 
<br>injuries and/or property damage. They continue to reach out 
<br>to the additional victims (about 20 more) and have enlisted 
<br>the help of the Iraqi Police to locate the victims for which 
<br>there is no contact information (Note: Blackwater has agreed 
<br>to provide the Embassy with contact information for any 
<br>victims they are able to locate but for which the Embassy did 
<br>not have contact information or were not able to locate. The 
<br>Embassy will make its own payments to any additional victims 
<br>that it is able to locate in this manner. End Note.) 
<br>Blackwater said that on February 1, 2008, their Iraqi 
<br>attorneys would begin to meet with each of the victims to 
<br>express their sympathy and to interview them to subsequently 
<br>craft an individual condolence payment amount for each 
<br>victim. On average, Blackwater said it expects they will pay 
<br>at least twice as much as what the Embassy paid and 
<br>substantially more for victims or families that were more 
<br>significantly impacted by the incident. As an example, he 
<br>cited a family that lost their bread winner, a man who was 
<br>already supporting the families of four of his brothers whom 
<br>had been killed as a result of sectarian violence. 
<br>
<br>----------------- 
<br>CPA 17 Draft Law 
<br>---------------- 
<br>¶23. (C) There has been no change in the status of the draft 
<br>law to repeal CPA Order 17. The Council of Ministers 
<br>approved a draft law and voted to send it to the Council of 
<br>Representatives, but to date the draft has not yet been 
<br>transmitted to the CoR. Once submitted, the law could pass 
<br>in as little as one to two weeks given existing procedures. 
<br>There has not, however, been much discussion on this draft 
<br>law in recent weeks. We have engaged the GOI in an effort to 
<br>prevent the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs from 
<br>submitting the proposed legislation to the CoR. In meetings 
<br>with and in letters to GOI officials, we have highlighted the 
<br>steps that the Embassy has taken to implement the Kennedy 
<br>Report recommendations, the Memorandum of Agreement between 
<br>the Department of State and Department of Defense on USG PSDs 
<br>that was recently signed, and the ongoing FBI investigation 
<br>into the September 16 incident.
