<br>------------------------ 
<br>Gentlemen, We've Got Him! 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) In a conference call with Ambassador and DCM, 
<br>President Ali Abdallah Saleh informed us last night, Tuesday, 
<br>April 12, that suspected terrorist Kanaan has been caught. 
<br>Saleh began with, "You know this man Kanaan who has been 
<br>threatening you and for whose sake you closed down your 
<br>embassy? Well, we've caught him. In fact, we also arrested, 
<br>two days ago, two of his top assistants." Saleh went on to 
<br>say that these arrests show the "seriousness and honesty" of 
<br>his services and the political will at the top for full 
<br>cooperation with "our friends the Americans." You, on the 
<br>other hand said Saleh, "don't move on our requests." Saleh 
<br>reassured us that his cooperation and the cooperation of his 
<br>"services" would continue no matter what. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>Now, Where's Our Stuff? 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Saleh did not waste time for his usual quid-pro-quo 
<br>tactics. "So, where's my stuff? We have requested equipment 
<br>and weapons for our CSF counter terrorism unit," said Saleh. 
<br>"We have suffered important and costly losses in Saada and we 
<br>need your help. Please tell Washington that this is urgent." 
<br>"I respond to you immediately when you need something," added 
<br>Saleh, "and now, you must do the same for me." 
<br>
<br>--------------- 
<br>Action Request: 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) We have presented, through military channels, a list 
<br>of items requested by the Minister of Interior specifically 
<br>for his CSF/CTU unit (reftel). The Ambassador will be sending 
<br>a message separately to Centcom leadership to see about 
<br>speeding up some material already requested through FMF 
<br>funds. Post hereby requests Department and NSC assistance in 
<br>having a deliverable, or two, for NSC to offer as a pat on 
<br>the back during the planned telephone conversation later this 
<br>week. The deliverable could be any of the items in reftel, 
<br>but we recommend and advance on the armored vehicles which 
<br>MOI says are urgently needed for an operation against an AQ 
<br>target in the Ma'rib region.
