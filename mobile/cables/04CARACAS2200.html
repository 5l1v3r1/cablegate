<br>-------
<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) HERMA MARKSMAN, CHAVEZ'S FORMER COMMON-LAW WIFE FROM
<br>1984-1993, SPOKE TO POLOFFS ON JULY 1 ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT
<br>OF CHAVEZ'S POLITICAL IDEOLOGY. SHE CLAIMS THAT CHAVEZ WAS
<br>INFLUENCED BY 1960'S GUERRILLAS. MARKSMAN DISAGREED WITH THE
<br>OPPOSITION'S PORTRAYAL OF CHAVEZ AS AN IDIOT AND WARNED THAT
<br>HE IS A DETERMINED MAN WHO TRUSTS FEW PEOPLE. WHILE WE
<br>ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME OF HER INFORMATION MAY BE BIASED, WE
<br>THOUGHT WASHINGTON MAY APPRECIATE AN INSIGHT INTO CHAVEZ FROM
<br>SOMEONE WHO KNEW HIM INTIMATELY BEFORE HE ENTERED THE
<br>NATIONAL STAGE. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>ROOTS OF CHAVEZ'S BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) HERMA MARKSMAN, A HISTORY PROFESSOR AND CHAVEZ'S
<br>FORMER COMMON-LAW WIFE, DISCUSSED HOW CHAVEZ ARRIVED TO HIS
<br>CURRENT POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. (NOTE: COMMON-LAW MARRIAGE IS
<br>A WIDESPREAD PRACTICE IN VENEZUELA.) AS A POOR CHILD GROWING
<br>UP IN THE RURAL STATE OF BARINAS, MARKSMAN ALLEGES CHAVEZ WAS
<br>INFLUENCED BY A TEACHER, WHO ADMIRED FIDEL CASTRO AND CHE
<br>GUEVARA. SHE CLAIMS THAT CHAVEZ WAS AMBITIOUS FROM AN EARLY
<br>AGE AND EVEN THOUGHT OF RUNNING THE COUNTRY AS A 20 YEAR-OLD.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) AS A JUNIOR OFFICER, CHAVEZ SOON FELL UNDER THE
<br>INFLUENCE OF DOUGLAS BRAVO, A FORMER COMMUNIST AND GUERRILLA
<br>LEADER DURING THE 1960S. CHAVEZ'S BROTHER, ADAN, PLAYED A
<br>KEY ROLE IN INTRODUCING CHAVEZ TO BRAVO, ACCORDING TO LOCAL
<br>PRESS REPORTS. MARKSMAN STATED THAT IT WAS BRAVO, NOT
<br>CHAVEZ, WHO DEVELOPED THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE BOLIVARIAN
<br>REVOLUTION, WHICH IS ROOTED IN THE WORKS OF SIMON RODRIGUEZ,
<br>SIMON BOLIVAR, AND EZEQUIEL ZAMORA. BRAVO'S MOVEMENT
<br>STRESSED THE NEED FOR CIVIL-MILITARY COOPERATION TO IMPLEMENT
<br>THE BOLIVARIAN REVOLUTION. WHILE CHAVEZ BROKE WITH BRAVO IN
<br>1986, HE MAINTAINED BRAVO'S POLITICAL IDEOLOGY, WHICH PLAYED
<br>A KEY ROLE IN CHAVEZ'S FAILED COUP IN 1992. MARKSMAN ALLUDED
<br>TO THE FAILED COUP--WHICH SHE HAS PUBLICLY CRITICIZED--AS A
<br>CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO HER ENDING THE RELATIONSHIP, THOUGH
<br>SHE DID NOT DIRECTLY STATE THE REASON FOR ENDING THE AFFAIR
<br>WITH CHAVEZ.
<br>
<br>
<br>-----------------------
<br>CHAVEZ IS NOBODY'S FOOL
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) THROUGHOUT HER MEETING WITH POLOFFS, MARKSMAN ASSERTED
<br>THAT CHAVEZ SHOULD NOT BE UNDERESTIMATED. SHE DESCRIBED THE
<br>PRESIDENT AS AN EXCELLENT STORYTELLER, WHO OFTEN
<br>CHARACTERIZES HIS OPPONENTS AS DEVILS, WHICH IS A POWERFUL
<br>RELIGIOUS SYMBOL AMONG THE POOR. WHILE THE EDUCATED CLASS
<br>MAY SCOFF AT CHAVEZ'S FIVE-HOUR TELEVISION BROADCASTS,
<br>MARKSMAN CLAIMED THAT THE POOR BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS
<br>INTERESTED IN THEIR ISSUES. SHE ALSO STATED THAT CHAVEZ IS
<br>FOCUSED ON HIS GOAL OF TRANSFORMING THE COUNTRY AND IS
<br>WILLING TO WIN AT ANY COSTS. CHAVEZ WOULD ONLY HAVE AGREED
<br>TO THE PRESIDENTIAL RECALL REFERENDUM IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD
<br>WIN, ACCORDING TO MARKSMAN.
<br>
<br>------------------------
<br>CHAVEZ'S INNER CIRCLE
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) MARKSMAN STATED THAT CHAVEZ IS LOYAL TO NO ONE AND
<br>DOES NOT HAVE TRUE FRIENDS. IF HE HAS A PROBLEM, HE WILL
<br>ONLY CONFIDE IN HIS BROTHER, ADAN, WHOM SHE CHARACTERIZED AS
<br>A COMMUNIST, AND CUBAN LEADER FIDEL CASTRO. SHE ALLEGED THAT
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00002200 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>OUPS IN LATIN AMERICA. SHE
<br>STATED THAT CHAVEZ DOES HAVE SEVERAL OF ADAN'S FRIENDS IN
<br>GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING GUILLERMO GARCIA PONCE--A POLITICAL
<br>ADVISER TO CHAVEZ, MEMBER OF THE DEFUNCT POLITICAL
<br>PARTICIPATION COMMISSION OF THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL,
<br>EDITOR OF VEA NEWSPAPER, AND COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) SHE LISTED SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WHOM SHE CONSIDERED TO
<br>BE THE MOST DANGEROUS MEN IN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING DIOSDADO
<br>CABELLO (FORMER INFRASTRUCTURE MINISTER, NATIONAL LOGISTICS
<br>COORDINATOR FOR THE COMANDO MAISANTA AND GUBERNATORIAL
<br>CANDIDATE FOR MIRANDA STATE); AND ELIECER OTAIZA (FORMER
<br>DIRECTOR OF CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, DISIP, AND THE
<br>CURRENT DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COOPERATIVE
<br>EDUCATION, INCE). AS CHIEF OF INCE, OTAIZA HAS RUN VARIOUS
<br>"MISSION" PROGRAMS, ACCORDING TO MARKSMAN. SHE ALSO
<br>MENTIONED WILLIAM IZARRA, DIRECTOR OF IDEOLOGY FOR THE
<br>COMANDO MAISANTA, JESSE CHACON, COMMUNICATIONS AND
<br>INFORMATION MINISTER, AND RONALDO BLANCO LA CRUZ, GOVERNOR OF
<br>TACHIRA STATE.
<br>
<br>
<br>-------
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) WHILE MARKSMAN'S STATEMENTS MAY BE BIASED, SHE DOES
<br>OFFER A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE INTO THE CURRENT PRESIDENT. HER
<br>CHARACTERIZATION OF CHAVEZ AS AN AMBITIOUS, DETERMINED MAN
<br>CONTRASTS WITH THE OPPOSITION'S PORTRAYAL OF HIM AT TIMES AS
<br>A BUFFOON. CHAVEZ'S UNWILLINGNESS TO TRUST OTHERS, HOWEVER,
<br>LIKELY CONTRIBUTES TO HIS GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE IN EXECUTING
<br>MANY OF HIS INITIATIVES.
