<br>Introduction
<br>------------
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) In view of continued Washington questions about
<br>the operations of Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB) and Bank
<br>Austria Creditanstalt (BA/CA) in several areas, this cable
<br>attempts to consolidate all the information that this Mission
<br>has regarding allegations and GoA responses. Embassy would
<br>appreciate any additional information Washington agencies may
<br>have regarding these banking concerns. The following message
<br>has been cleared with all relevant agencies at post.
<br>
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>--------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) The Austrian Ministry of Finance (MoF) told us
<br>February 15 that Bank Austria/Creditanstalt (BA/CA) has
<br>agreed to "stop doing business" with North Korean entities.
<br>An Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) official told us
<br>February 14 that the FMA was "uncomfortable" with Raiffeisen
<br>Investment Holding AG's (RIAG) involvement in RosUkrEnergo
<br>(RUE) and RUE's role in the Ukrainian-Russian gas deal.
<br>However, the FMA is satisfied that an internal RIAG due
<br>diligence and an outside due diligence by the U.S. risk
<br>consulting firm Kroll revealed no derogatory information on
<br>RUE's unnamed investors and no links to Russian organized
<br>crime boss Semyon Mogilevich. Both the FMA and MoF
<br>emphasized RIAG's commitment to expand operations in Eastern
<br>Europe, maintaining that western commercial influences in the
<br>region were beneficial to the countries. Embassy's Legatt
<br>Office has been cooperating closely with Austrian law
<br>enforcement authorities since summer 2005 on a multi-country
<br>investigation of Mogilevich's money laundering activities in
<br>the region. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) On February 14 and 15, EconUnit Chief followed up
<br>on ref B and C discussions in separate meetings with xxxxx
<br> from the Financial Market Authority's (FMA) xxxxx of the Ministry of
<br>Finance's Financial Markets Directorate.xxxxx
<br>reviewed the various USG concerns (ref D) in a systemic
<br>manner. Both appreciated the information the USG had shared,
<br>agreed to continue cooperation on a technical level regarding
<br>USG concerns, and acknowledged that there was a political
<br>component associated with these issues.
<br>
<br>
<br>North Korea
<br>-----------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) xxxxx told us that following a meeting with
<br>Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser the week of February 6,
<br>Erich Hampel, the CEO of BA/CA, agreed to stop BA/CA's
<br>business relations with North Korean entities. xxxxx
<br>speculated that BA/CA probably made the decision to maintain
<br>its good reputation.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. WMD Proliferation Financing Issues
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶A. (S/NF) USG Concern: Novin Energy Company, a firm
<br>affiliated with Iran's nuclear program, was involved in a
<br>payment from Creditanstalt to Mileace General Trading in May
<br>2004 (ref D).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) GOA Response: xxxxx reiterated information
<br>discussed during Treasury U/S Levey's meeting with xxxxx, 
<br>the FMA's Executive Director (ref B). The
<br>Iranian Mission to the International Atomic Energy had opened
<br>a deposit bank account for Novin Energy Company at BA/CA.
<br>According to xxxxx there have been no transactions that
<br>aroused the FMA's suspicion. Periodically, there is a large
<br>transfer to the Iranian National Bank. The FMA identified
<br>only one payment to Mileace General Trading in New York for
<br>an amount "under Euro 100,000."
<br>
<br>¶B. (S/NF) USG Concern: Since 2001, Creditanstalt xxxxx has facilitated about a
<br>dozen Iranian transactions, mostly nuclear-related (ref D).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) GOA Response: xxxxx said the FMA was satisfied,
<br>based on discussions with BA/CA, that xxxxx had not engaged
<br>in any illegal or questionable activity. xxxxx is aware of
<br>the sensitive nature of his position. He has over 10 years
<br>experience in this position and works very closely with the
<br>Austrian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), xxxxx stated.
<br>¶C. (S/NF) USG Concern: Syria was preparing to purchase
<br>rocket motors for training aircraft from the Czech supply
<br>company Omnipol. Financing was to be arranged with
<br>Creditanstalt (ref D).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) GOA Response: BA/CA has no direct business
<br>relationship with Omnipol. However, Omnipol does have an
<br>account with HVB Czech, a subsidiary of BA/CA. According to
<br>xxxxx HVB Czech needs BA/CA's authorization to transfer
<br>amounts in excess of Euro 500,000. xxxxx maintained that
<br>the only financing Omnipol has had through HVB Czech was for
<br>the Czech Army's purchase of U.S. military equipment.
<br>
<br>¶6. Terrorist Financing Issues
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶A. (S/NF) USG Concern: The Palestinian Association of
<br>Austria (PVOE) maintained a Creditanstalt account as of early
<br>¶2003. PVOE -- designated by the U.S. Treasury Department as
<br>a terrorist entity and renamed the Palestinian Humanitarian
<br>Association (PHV) -- collects donations on behalf of
<br>HAMAS-affiliated charities in the Palestinian territories.
<br>PHV's Internet website indicates that the organization
<br>continues to maintain an account at Creditanstalt (ref D).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) GOA Response: xxxxx stated that BA/CA had closed
<br>all its PVOE accounts well before the U.S. designated PVOE as
<br>a terrorist entity. xxxxx claimed that the FIU has
<br>conducted two extensive investigations into PHV, which did
<br>not turn up anything suspicious.
<br>
<br>¶B. (S/NF) USG Concern: As of late November 2004, xxxxx ,
<br> a former regime official now on the Iraqi
<br>interim government's "Most Wanted" list, claimed to have
<br>transferred a large sum of unspecified currency from the Arab
<br>Bank in Amman, Jordan, to RZB to finance the Iraq insurgency
<br>(ref D).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) GOA Response: xxxxx said that RZB has not
<br>identified any accounts belonging xxxxx following a
<br>thorough search that included numerous transliterations of
<br>xxxxx.
<br>
<br>¶C. (S/NF) USG Concern: The Vienna-based NGO Irakhilfswerk
<br>in Osterreich instructs donors to send funds to Creditanstalt
<br>(ref D).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) GOA Response: xxxxx characterized Irakhilfswerk's
<br>websites as distasteful, e.g. with gruesome pictures of
<br>wounded or dead U.S. military personnel. Nevertheless,
<br>xxxxx said an extensive investigation by the Austrian
<br>security services (BVT) revealed that Irakhilfswerk does
<br>indeed use collected funds for charitable work in Iraq, e.g.,
<br>purchasing medicines and clothing. xxxxx said the FMA
<br>continued to monitor Irakhilfswerk accounts closely.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. Money Laundering Issues
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶A. (S/NF) USG Concern: Following the recent U.S. sanctions
<br>on Banco Delta Asia (BDA), there are indications that North
<br>Korea moved several million euros from BDA to Creditanstalt
<br>in October 2006 (ref D).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) GOA Response: xxxxx restated information in ref C,
<br>stressing that the FMA had no evidence that the BDA had ever
<br>had an account with BA/CA. However, there was one payment
<br>transfer in the amount of Euro 7 million that originated from
<br>a Macao trading company via the Bank of China and Dresdner,
<br>which BA/CA transferred to the Sberbank in Moscow. The FMA
<br>admitted it did not know what the payment was. Other
<br>payments from BA/CA's few North Korean accounts were
<br>typically to international entities active in North Korea,
<br>such as UNICEF, WFP, WHO, and the Swiss Development Agency.
<br>xxxxx emphasized that the FMA exercised additional
<br>surveillance regarding North Korean financial activities
<br>through the Austrian banking system.
<br>
<br>¶B. (S/NF) USG Concern: U.S.-indicted crime boss Semyon
<br>Mogilevich probably uses RZB and its subsidiary Raiffeisen
<br>Investment Holding AG (RIAG) as a front to provide legitimacy
<br>to the gas company that we suspect he controls, RosUkrEnergo
<br>(RUE). RUE makes direct payments of $360,000 annually to
<br>each of two RIAG executives in "consulting fees." We assess
<br>that the payments probably are bribes for RIAG to maintain
<br>the front for Mogilevich (ref D).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) GOA Response: xxxxx acknowledged that the
<br>non-transparency surrounding the gas deal had become a major
<br>political issue in Ukraine and Russia. The FMA is
<br>"uncomfortable" that an Austrian bank is in the middle of the
<br>controversy. The FMA, xxxxx continued, had had "intense
<br>discussions" with RZB/RIAG, but could not uncover any legal
<br>improprieties. RIAG also conducted a strenuous due diligence
<br>review of the unnamed RUE investors. Neither RIAG's internal
<br>due diligence nor an independent due diligence by the U.S.
<br>risk consulting firm Kroll had revealed derogatory
<br>information or links to criminal activity, including to
<br>Seymon Mogilevich (ref A). Regarding the RUE payments of
<br>$360,000 to RIAG executives, xxxxx maintained that the
<br>payments, in the names of the four RIAG executives on the RUE
<br>Coordination Committee, went directly into a RIAG account, to
<br>which none of the executives had access. RZB General Legal
<br>Counsel told xxxxx January 30 that the Kroll Report found "no
<br>link between the undisclosed investors and Mogilevich."
<br>(Note: Embassy is working with RIAG to obtain a copy of the
<br>Kroll report. End Note.) xxxxx speculated that RIAG's
<br>primary objective is to prepare RUE for a January 2007 IPO on
<br>the FTSE.
<br>
<br>(S/NF) Embassy Note and Comment: Embassy's Legatt Office has
<br>been cooperating closely with Austrian law enforcement
<br>authorities since summer 2005 on a multi-country
<br>investigation of Mogilevich's money laundering activities in
<br>the region. Embassy suggests that Washington agencies
<br>carefully consider this on-going investigation in regard to
<br>further intervention with various GoA entities on
<br>Mogilevich's links to RUE. End Embassy Comment.
<br>
<br>¶C. (S/NF) USG Concern: RIAG holds a 61% stake in Priorbank,
<br>Belarus' largest foreign-owned bank. Priorbank maintains
<br>close ties to the Lukaschenko regime (ref D).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) GOA Response: xxxxx noted that
<br>Raiffeisen had been active in Eastern European markets, some
<br>less democratic than others, for many years. Raiffeisen
<br>believed that western commercial engagement, rather than
<br>isolation, had had positive effects in undemocratic countries
<br>(ref A). He noted that EBRD is a 13.5% shareholder in
<br>Priorbank. xxxxx noted that there were no international
<br>financial or trade sanctions against Belarus or senior
<br>Belarussian officials.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. Suspicious Activity Reports
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶A. (S/NF) USG Concern: U.S. banks reported 75 and 217
<br>suspicious activity reports (SARs) since the late 1990s
<br>involving BA/CA and RZB, respectively. Some transactions
<br>involve shell companies used by criminal groups (ref D).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) GOA Response: xxxxx said the Austrian FIU did not
<br>believe that the quantity of SARs filed since the late 1990s
<br>was especially high, especially for BA/CA. xxxxx said RZB
<br>believes the overwhelming majority of its SARs stem from its
<br>major U.S. dollar clearing operations throughout Eastern and
<br>Central Europe. xxxxx added that the FMA had met with the
<br>CEOs of BA/CA and RZB to heighten the banks' awareness of USG
<br>concerns.
<br>
<br>
<br>Statistics on BA/CA and RZB
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Bank Austria Creditanstalt (BA/CA) maintains 1,521
<br>offices and branches, including 1,121 in Central and Eastern
<br>Europe, South East Europe, and the CIS countries. In 2004,
<br>its balance sheet assets totalled 146,516 million Euros. It
<br>has 31,300 employees, of whom 21,100 are in Central and
<br>Eastern Europe, South East Europe and the CIS.
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) Raiffaisen Zentralbank (RZB) has 987 offices,
<br>including 970 in Central and Eastern Europe, South East
<br>Europe and the CIS. It had balance sheet assets of 67,946
<br>million Euros in 2004. It employs 27,200, of whom 24,500 are
<br>in Central and Eastern Europe, Southeast Europe and the CIS.
