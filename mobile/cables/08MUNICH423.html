<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) The Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU),
<br>dangerously weakened, is attempting to sharpen its profile
<br>among Bavarian and national voters, by pursuing an aggressive
<br>economic campaign that diverges from that of its sister
<br>party, Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democrats. The CSU is
<br>finding plenty of opportunities to profile itself locally and
<br>nationally in addressing the challenges presented by the
<br>financial crisis. For one, Bavarian Minister President
<br>Seehofer has threatened to boycott the January 5 "coalition
<br>summit" if Chancellor Merkel does not bend to the CSU's
<br>recipe for responding to Germany's economic downturn through
<br>a tax reform proposal. Merkel needs a strong CSU showing in
<br>Bavaria to achieve her goal of a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition after
<br>the 2009 national elections, but the CSU's strategy could
<br>build tensions between the sister parties. How the CDU-CSU
<br>divisions play out could influence national economic policy
<br>as well as how the upcoming campaign will shape up in the
<br>months to come. End Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>CSU SALTING THE CDU'S SOUP 
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The CSU still holds Chancellor Merkel partly
<br>responsible for the CSU's poor outcome in the September 2008
<br>state elections. Merkel failed to support the CSU, for
<br>example, on the tax deductibility of commuting costs, one of
<br>the CSU's key issues that the CDU had rejected until the
<br>latest ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court that agreed
<br>with the position of the CSU. Erwin Huber, former head of
<br>the CSU, said "the CDU should have listened to us instead of
<br>Finance Minister Steinbrueck (SPD) on this sensitive issue."
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, Secretary General of the
<br>CSU (PROTECT), told the Consul General on December 17 that
<br>the CSU is "heating up the debate" and will meet on January 4
<br>"to map out a strategy for the 2009 election campaign,"
<br>adding, "We want to be more like the party was under Edmund
<br>Stoiber and Franz Josef Straus (both legendary former
<br>Minister Presidents)." Or, as Hartmut Kotschyk (CSU party
<br>whip in the Bundestag) put it to the P/E Chief recently, "We
<br>want to be the salt in their soup."
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Zu Guttenberg and Koschyk reviewed possible
<br>approaches the CSU would take with its platform for 2009.
<br>
<br>a) Taking a hard line against EU membership not only for
<br>Turkey but also for Ukraine. The CSU could lump Turkey and
<br>Ukraine together so neither country could feel singled out
<br>for bad treatment. The CSU's new foreign policy spokeswoman
<br>in the Bundestag, Dorothee Baer, told Berlin PolMC that this
<br>would be a focus of the CSU's campaign for European
<br>Parliament elections in June 2009.
<br>
<br>b) Insisting on more EU "subsidiarity." The CSU wants more
<br>respect for national and regional and local prerogatives in
<br>governance and administrative control, such as allowing
<br>restrictions on bioengineered seeds.
<br>
<br>c) Strengthening and refocusing the economy. The CSU wants
<br>a renewed commitment to human over financial capital as a way
<br>to address what Koschyk called "a believability problem among
<br>the rank and file Germans for the market economy." Zu
<br>Guttenberg complained that "Merkel was not being assertive
<br>enough on the economy," echoing recent statements by Horst
<br>Seehofer, Bavarian Minister President (CSU). However, he
<br>also admitted that he could understand her approach since he
<br>found her to be "personally conservative" and "not one to be
<br>in the front on bold initiatives." He expected she was
<br>"trying to maintain her options in 2009" as well as "trying
<br>to stay close to the coalition Social Democratic Party (SPD)."
<br>
<br>
<br>BAVARIA'S PRESIDENT CUTTING A MEAN FIGURE 
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Finally, MP Seehofer has criticized the CDU in
<br>public around Bavaria, in Berlin, and in the media, which
<br>reported that CDU leaders viewed his actions as
<br>"unpredictable" because he made proposals that strayed from
<br>
<br>MUNICH 00000423 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>the coalition's party line. He criticized the Chancellor's
<br>economic course, for example, arguing that Germany needed a
<br>larger and more meaningful program than the Chancellor had
<br>supported. Seehofer preserved the independence of Bavarian
<br>control over the Bayerische Landesbank (BayernLB) by
<br>rejecting the Federal rescue package in an attempt to use
<br>only Bavarian resources. And, he pushed for immediate tax
<br>deductions, not just some time after the election.
<br>
<br>COMMENT: CREATING INDIVIDUALITY WITHOUT KILLING EACH OTHER 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Chancellor Merkel and the CDU need a strong and
<br>cooperative Bavarian CSU partner in order to win the 2009
<br>Bundestag election. Down in Bavaria, the CSU must get
<br>stronger, too, and is fighting for its uniqueness as a
<br>regional party with national and international credentials.
<br>Although the ultimate goals are compatible, the CSU
<br>necessarily must set itself apart from the CDU to prove
<br>itself to skeptical locals who knocked the CSU off its high
<br>horse in the last election. The challenge for both parties
<br>is to allow the CSU to profile itself without killing the
<br>relationship, and each other's chances, with an overly
<br>aggressive factional campaign.
