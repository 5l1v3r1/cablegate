<br>SUBJECT: The End is Nigh 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Christopher W. Dell under Section 1.4b/d 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C)  Having said my piece repeatedly over the last three years, 
<br>I won't offer a lengthy prescription for our Zimbabwe 
<br>policy.  My views can be stated very simply as stay the 
<br>course and prepare for change.  Our policy is working and it's 
<br>helping to drive change here.  What is required is simply the grit, 
<br>determination and focus to see this through.  Then, when the changes 
<br>finally come we must be ready to move quickly to help consolidate 
<br>the new dispensation. 
<br> 
<br>THE SITUATION 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C)  Robert Mugabe has survived for so long because he is more 
<br>clever and more ruthless than any other politician in 
<br>Zimbabwe.  To give the devil his due, he is a brilliant 
<br>tactitian and has long thrived on his ability to abruptly 
<br>change the rules of the game, radicalize the political 
<br>dynamic and force everyone else to react to his agenda. 
<br>However, he is fundamentally hampered by several factors: 
<br>his ego and belief in his own infallibility; his obsessive 
<br>focus on the past as a justification for everything in the 
<br>present and future; his deep ignorance on economic issues 
<br>(coupled with the belief that his 18 doctorates give him 
<br>the authority to suspend the laws of economics, including 
<br>supply and demand); and his essentially short-term, 
<br>tactical style. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C)  While his tactical skills have kept him in power for 27 
<br>years, over the last seven this has only been achieved by a 
<br>series of populist, but destructive and ultimately 
<br>self-defeating moves.  In reaction to losing the 2000 
<br>referendum on the constitution, a vengeful Mugabe unleashed 
<br>his QGreen BombersQ to commit land reform and in the 
<br>process he destroyed ZimbabweQs agricultural sector, once the 
<br>bedrock of the economy.  While thousands of white farmers 
<br>saw their properties seized, hundreds of thousands of black 
<br>Zimbabweans lost their livelihoods and were reduced to utter 
<br>poverty.  In 2005, having been forced to steal victory by 
<br>manipulating the results of an election he lost, Mugabe 
<br>lashed out again, punishing the urban populace by launching 
<br>Operation Murambatsvina.  The result was wholesale 
<br>destruction of the informal sector, on which as much as 
<br>70-80 percent of urban dwellers had depended, and the 
<br>uprooting of 700,000 Zimbabweans.  The current inflationary 
<br>cycle really began with Murambatsvina, as rents and prices 
<br>grew in response to a decrease in supply. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C)  And now, faced with the hyperinflationary consequences 
<br>of his ruinous fiscal policies and growing reliance on the 
<br>printing press to keep his government running, Mugabe has 
<br>launched Operation Slash Prices.  This has once again given 
<br>him a very temporary boost in popularity (especially among 
<br>the police, who have led the looting of retail outlets and 
<br>now seem well positioned to take a leading role in the 
<br>black market economy) at the cost of terrible damage to the 
<br>country and people.  Many small grocery and shop owners, 
<br>traders, etc., will be wiped out; the shelves are 
<br>increasingly bare; hunger, fear, and tension are growing; 
<br>fuel has disappeared.  When the shelves are still empty 
<br>this time next week, the popular appeal of the price roll 
<br>back will evaporate and the government simply doesnQt have 
<br>the resources to replace the entire private commercial 
<br>sector and keep Zimbabweans fed.  It may attempt to do so 
<br>by printing more money, adding even more inflationary 
<br>pressure on a system already reeling from the GOZQs 
<br>quasi-fiscal lunacy combined with the price impact of 
<br>pervasive shortages.  The increasingly worthless Zim dollar 
<br>is likely to collapse as a unit of trade in the near 
<br>future, depriving the GOZ of its last economic tool other 
<br>than sheer thuggery and theft of othersQ assets. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C)  With all this in view, IQm convinced the end is not 
<br> 
<br>HARARE 00000638  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>far off for the Mugabe regime.  Of course, my predecessors 
<br>and many other observers have all said the same thing, and 
<br>yet Mugabe is still with us.  I think this time could prove 
<br>different, however, because for the first time the 
<br>president is under intensifying pressure simultaneously on 
<br>the economic, political and international fronts.  In the 
<br>past, he could always play one of these off against the 
<br>other, using economic moves to counter political pressure 
<br>or playing the old colonial/race/imperialist themes to buy 
<br>himself breathing room regionally and internationally.  But 
<br>he is running out of options and in the swirling gases of 
<br>the new Zimbabwean constellation that is starting to form, 
<br>the economic, political and international pressures are 
<br>concentrating on Mugabe himself.  Our ZANU-PF contacts are 
<br>virtually unanimous in saying reform is desperately needed, 
<br>but won't happen while the Old Man is there, and therefore 
<br>he must go (finding the courage to make that happen is 
<br>another matter, however, but even that may be coming closer). 
<br>This is not some sudden awakening on the road to 
<br>Damascus, but a reflection of the pain even party insiders 
<br>increasingly feel over the economic meltdown.  We also get 
<br>regular, albeit anecdotal, reports of angry and 
<br>increasingly open mutterings against Mugabe even in ZANU-PF's 
<br>traditional rural bastions.   Beginning in March, the 
<br>other SADC leaders finally recognized (in the wake of the 
<br>terrible beatings of March 11 and the international outcry 
<br>that followed Q another self-inflicted wound for Mugabe) 
<br>that Zimbabwe is a problem they need to address.  Thabo 
<br>Mbeki appears committed to a successful mediation and is 
<br>reportedly increasingly irritated with MugabeQs efforts to 
<br>manipulate him or blow him off altogether.  If Mugabe 
<br>judges that he still commands all he surveys by virtue of 
<br>being the elder statesman on the scene, he may be 
<br>committing yet another serious blunder.  Finally, one does 
<br>well to recall that the only serious civil disturbances 
<br>here in a decade came in 1998 over bread shortages, showing 
<br>that even the famously passive Shona people have their 
<br>limits.  The terror and oppression of the 
<br>intervening years have cowed people, but itQs anyoneQs guess 
<br>whether their fear or their anger will win out in the end. 
<br> 
<br>WHAT WILL THE END LOOK LIKE? 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C)  This is the big, unanswerable question.  One thing 
<br>at least is certain, Mugabe will not wake up one morning a 
<br>changed man, resolved to set right all he has wrought.  He 
<br>will not go quietly nor without a fight.  He will cling to 
<br>power at all costs and the costs be damned, he deserves to 
<br>rule by virtue of the liberation struggle and land reform and 
<br>the people of Zimbabwe have let him down by failing to 
<br>appreciate this, thus he neednQt worry about their 
<br>well-being.  The only scenario in which he might agree to 
<br>go with a modicum of good grace is one in which he 
<br>concludes that the only way to end his days a free man is 
<br>by leaving State House.  I judge that he is still a long 
<br>way from this conclusion and will fight on for now. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C)  The optimal outcome, of course, and the only one that 
<br>doesnQt bring with it a huge risk of violence and conflict, is 
<br>a genuinely free and fair election, under international 
<br>supervision.  The Mbeki mediation offers the best, albeit 
<br>very slim, hope of getting there.  However, as Pretoria 
<br>grows more and more worried about the chaos to its north 
<br>and President MbekiQs patience with MugabeQs antics wears 
<br>thin, the prospects for serious South African engagement 
<br>may be growing.  Thus, this effort deserves all the support 
<br>and backing we can muster.  Less attractive is the idea of 
<br>a South African-brokered transitional arrangement or 
<br>government of national unity.  Mbeki has always favored 
<br>stability and in his mind this means a ZANU-PF-led GNU, with 
<br>perhaps a few MDC additions.  This solution is more likely 
<br>to prolong than resolve the crisis and we must guard 
<br>against letting Pretoria dictate an outcome which 
<br> 
<br>HARARE 00000638  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>perpetuates the status quo at the expense of real change 
<br>and reform. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C)  The other scenarios are all less attractive:  a popular 
<br>uprising would inevitably entail a bloodbath, even if it 
<br>were ultimately successful; MugabeQs sudden, unexpected 
<br>death would set off a stampede for power among ZANU-PF 
<br>heavy weights; a palace coup, whether initiated within 
<br>ZANU-PF or from the military - in which Mugabe is removed, 
<br>killed, exiled or otherwise disposed of, could well devolve 
<br>into open conflict between the contending successors.   Similarly, 
<br>some form of "constitutional coup" i.e., a change at the top 
<br>engineered within the framework of ZANU-PFQs "legitimate" 
<br>structures could well prove to be merely the opening bell 
<br>in a prolonged power struggle.  None of the players is 
<br>likely to go quietly into the night without giving everything 
<br>they have, including calling on 
<br>their supporters in the security services. Moreover, experience 
<br>elsewhere would suggest that whoever comes out on top 
<br>initially will struggle, and more than likely fail, to halt 
<br>the economic collapse.  Thus, there is a good prospect of 
<br>not one but a series of rapid-fire Qtransitions,Q until 
<br>some new, stable dispensation is reached. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C)  The final, and probably worst, possibility is that Mugabe 
<br>concludes he can settle for ruling over a rump Zimbabwe, 
<br>maintaining control over Harare and the Mashona heartland, 
<br>the critical forces of the National Reserve Force and CIO 
<br>and a few key assets Q gold, diamonds, platinum and Air 
<br>Zimbabwe to fund the good times.  Under this scenario the 
<br>rest of the country, in one of the comradeQs favorite 
<br>phrases, could Qgo hang,Q leaving it to the international 
<br>community to stave off the worst humanitarian consequences. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>WHAT OF THE OPPOSITION? 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C)  ZimbabweQs opposition is far from ideal and I leave 
<br>convinced that had we had different partners we could have 
<br>achieved more already.  But you have to play the hand youQre dealt. 
<br>With that in mind, the current leadership has little executive 
<br>experience and will require massive hand holding and assistance 
<br>should they ever come to power. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C)  Morgan Tsvangarai is a brave, committed man and, by and 
<br>large, a democrat.  He is also the only player on the scene 
<br>right now with real star quality and the ability to rally 
<br>the masses.  But Tsvangarai is also a flawed figure, not 
<br>readily open to advice, indecisive and with questionable 
<br>judgment in selecting those around him.  He is the indispensable 
<br>element for opposition success, but possibly an albatross around 
<br>t heir necks once in power.  In short, he is a kind of Lech Walesa 
<br>character:  Zimbabwe needs him, but should not rely on his executive 
<br>abilities to lead the country's recovery.  Arthur Mutambara is young 
<br>and ambitious, attracted to radical, anti-western rhetoric and 
<br>smart as a whip.  But, in many respects heQs a light-weight 
<br>who has spent too much time reading U.S. campaign messaging 
<br>manuals and too little thinking about the real issues.  Welshman 
<br>Ncube has proven to be a deeply divisive 
<br>and destructive player in the opposition ranks and the 
<br>sooner he is pushed off the stage, the better.  But he is 
<br>useful to many, including the regime and South Africa, so 
<br>is probably a cross to be borne for some time yet.  The 
<br>prospects for healing the rift within the MDC seem dim, 
<br>which is a totally unnecessary self-inflicted wound on 
<br>their part this time.  With few exceptions Q Tendayi Biti, 
<br>Nelson Chamisa Q the talent is thin below the top ranks. 
<br>The great saving grace of the opposition is likely to be 
<br>found in the diaspora.  Most of ZimbabweQs best 
<br>professionals, entrepreneurs, businessmen and women, etc., 
<br>have fled the country.  They are the oppositionQs natural 
<br>allies and it is encouraging to see signs, particularly in 
<br>South Africa and the UK, that these people are talking, 
<br> 
<br>HARARE 00000638  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>sharing ideas, developing plans and thinking together about 
<br>future recovery. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C)  Unfortunately, among the MDCQs flaws is its inability to 
<br>work more effectively with the rest of civil society.  The 
<br>blame for this can be shared on both sides (many civil 
<br>society groups, like the NCA, are single-issue focused and 
<br>take the overall dynamic in unhelpful directions; others, 
<br>like WOZA, insist on going it alone as a matter of 
<br>principle), but ultimately it falls to the MDC as the 
<br>largest and the only true political party, to show the 
<br>way.  Once again, however, these are natural allies and 
<br>they have more reason to work together than fight against each 
<br>other. 
<br> 
<br>STAYING THE COURSE, PREPARING FOR CHANGE 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C)  If I am right and change is in the offing, we need to 
<br>step up our preparations.  The work done over the last year on 
<br>transition planning has been extremely useful, both for 
<br>stimulating a fresh look at our own assumptions and plans 
<br>and for forging a common approach among the traditional 
<br>donor community.  But the process has lagged since the 
<br>meetings in March in London and should be re-energized.  It is 
<br>encouraging in this respect that USAID Washington has 
<br>engaged the Mission here in discussing how we would use 
<br>additional resources in response to a genuinely 
<br>reform-minded government .  I hope this will continue and 
<br>the good work done so far will survive the usual 
<br>bloodletting of the budget process. 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C)  The official media has had a field day recently whooping 
<br>that "Dell leaves Zimbabwe a failed man".  That's not quite 
<br>how it looks from here.  I believe that the firm 
<br>U.S. stance, the willingness to speak out and stand up, 
<br>have contributed to the accelerating pace of change. 
<br>Mugabe and his henchman are like bullies everywhere:  if 
<br>they can intimidate you they will.  But ther're not used to 
<br>someone standing up to them and fighting back.  It catches them 
<br>off guard and that's when they make mistakes. The howls of protest 
<br>over critical  statements from Washington or negative coverage 
<br>on CNN are the clearest proof of how this hurts them.  Ditto 
<br>the squeals over Qillegal sanctions.Q  In addition, the regime 
<br>has become so used to calling the shots and dictating the 
<br>pace that the merest stumble panics them.  Many local 
<br>observers have noted that Mugabe is panicked and 
<br>desperate about hyperinflation at the moment, and hence heQs 
<br>making mistakes.  Possibly fatal mistakes.  We need to 
<br>keep the pressure on in order to keep Mugabe off his game 
<br>and on his back foot, relying on his own shortcomings to do 
<br>him in.  Equally important is an active U.S. leadership 
<br>role in the international community.  The UK is ham-strung 
<br>by its colonial past and domestic politics, thus, letting them 
<br>set the pace alone merely limits our effectiveness.  The EU is 
<br>divided between the hard north and its soft southern 
<br>underbelly.  The Africans are only now beginning to find 
<br>their voice.  Rock solid partners like Australia donQt 
<br>pack enough punch to step out front and the UN is a 
<br>non-player.  Thus it falls to the U.S., once again, to take 
<br>the lead, to say and do the hard things and to set the agenda. 
<br>Hundreds, maybe thousands, of ordinary Zimbabweans of all 
<br>kinds have told me that our clear, forthright stance has 
<br>given them hope and the courage to hang on.  By this regimeQs 
<br>standards, acting in the interests of the people may indeed be 
<br>considered a failure.  But I believe that the opposite is true, 
<br>and that we can be justifiably proud that in Zimbabwe we have 
<br>helped advance the PresidentQs freedom Agenda.  The people of 
<br>this country know it and recognize it and that is the true 
<br>touchstone of our success here.
