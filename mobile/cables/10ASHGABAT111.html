<br>SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN: CAT IMPLICATED IN PRESIDENTIAL
<br>SECURITY INCIDENT
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge Sylvia Reed Curran, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: There have been reports about a recent
<br>incident in which a motorist crossed an intersection
<br>in front President Berdimuhamedov's motorcade as it
<br>moved through Ashgabat. Several high ranking police
<br>officials were fired after the incident, and the
<br>driver of the vehicle was reportedly beaten and
<br>charged with attempted assassination. In another
<br>incident, a military official was fired after a cat
<br>ran in front of the president's car as he was
<br>traveling to his dacha. Rumors are also circulating
<br>that there was an assassination attempt against
<br>Berdimuhamedov last summer, which was immediately
<br>followed by heightened security measures. END
<br>SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) A police captain from the Diplomatic Security
<br>Department of the Ministry of Interior, often assigned
<br>to duty at the Embassy compound, told Embassy
<br>political assistant about the incident in December
<br>involving the president's motorcade. A motorist
<br>allegedly drove through a blocked-off intersection in
<br>front of the President's cortege in Ashgabat. It is
<br>not known how the car managed to bypass the police and
<br>Ministry of National Security (MNB) officers that
<br>cordon off the streets where the president's motorcade
<br>is going to pass. One ex-traffic police officer
<br>believes that the driver either ignored the officer
<br>blocking the street and simply by-passed him, or knew
<br>the officer personally and tried, unsuccessfully, to
<br>get through before the motorcade arrived.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) According to yet another source, the driver
<br>was a resident of Mary, driving a relative's car with
<br>Ashgabat license plates. It is possible the
<br>provincial driver was unfamiliar with local
<br>regulations. The driver was alone in the car. He was
<br>quickly stopped by presidential security and
<br>bodyguards before he even got close to the president's
<br>vehicle. The driver was reportedly "beaten black and
<br>blue" before being transported to an MNB detention
<br>facility. According to some, he was charged with
<br>attempted assassination and sentenced to 25 years in
<br>prison. The acting head of Ashgabat's traffic police
<br>department and his two deputies were fired the next
<br>day. (NOTE: The fired acting head of the Asghabat
<br>police force, Major Babamyrat, is a neighbor of an
<br>Embassy employee and confirmed having lost his job in
<br>December. END NOTE) The traffic police officer
<br>responsible for blocking the street in question was
<br>also jailed.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Another incident reportedly occurred two
<br>months ago that was feared to be an assassination
<br>attempt. It was committed by a cat that ran in front
<br>of the President's car as he was traveling to his
<br>residence in the village of Archibil. (NOTE: Archabil,
<br>20 kilometers from Ashgabat, is located in the
<br>foothills of the Kopet Dag Mountains and is surrounded
<br>by forest. END NOTE) A military lieutenant reported
<br>that an officer from the Presidential Security
<br>Regiment, responsible for safeguarding that particular
<br>area, was fired the following day.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) COMMENT: Presidential security measures
<br>appear to have been heightened in recent weeks. Even
<br>streets and parking lots located several blocks from
<br>the motorcade's route are blocked off, and any
<br>vehicles or pedestrians in the vicinity deemed
<br>suspicious are stopped and questioned. There are also
<br>rumors circulating that an assassination attempt
<br>against the president took place during a visit last
<br>August to Balkan Province. Whether or not there is
<br>any truth to the rumor, we have noted that since
<br>
<br>ASHGABAT 00000111 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>last summer, the President's security detail
<br>has become more professional and has increased
<br>the security cordon around President at events.
<br>END COMMENT.
