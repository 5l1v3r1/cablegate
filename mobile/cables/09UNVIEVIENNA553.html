<br> 
<br>REF: UNVIE 544 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Geoff Pyatt for reasons 1.4 (c) and (e) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C)   Summary.  On December 3, former Austrian Ambassador 
<br>to Tehran Michael Postl (please protect) debriefed MsnOff on 
<br>his final calls on Iranian officials as he left post.  He 
<br>noted that former Presidents Khatami and Rafsanjani both had 
<br>extracted themselves from the normal political scene and were 
<br>focused on tangential issues where their weight could still 
<br>be felt.  Nevertheless, Rafsanjani suggested that it would be 
<br>helpful if the West spoke out against the election fraud and 
<br>human rights violations that followed. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C)   Postl said that President Ahmadinejad's chief of 
<br>cabinet, Mashaie, made clear to him prior to the Geneva talks 
<br>that Iran was planning to approach the talks with a spirit of 
<br>compromise and that Postl would be "surprised" by Iran's 
<br>attitude.  Postl explained the lack of follow-through in the 
<br>wake of the talks as a probable decision by Supreme Leader 
<br>Khamenei that the West was not trustworthy or that Iran could 
<br>get more from the P5 plus 1 than the six offered in Geneva. 
<br>Majles Speaker Larijani's outspoken disapproval of the Tehran 
<br>Research Reactor deal advocated by Ahmadinejad could have 
<br>been an exercise of Larijani's first opportunity to undermine 
<br>Ahmadinejad after he was pressured to disavow himself of 
<br>knowledge that Iranian prisoners were being raped in jail, 
<br>which lost him credibility with the Iranian public.  Finally, 
<br>Postl argued that the U.S. should focus its outreach to Iran 
<br>on formats that Iranians perceive are less biased, such as 
<br>BBC Persian's version of Hardtalk or Press TV.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C)   On December 3, former Austrian Ambassador to Tehran 
<br>Michael Postl gave MsnOff a readout of the state of domestic 
<br>political wranglings in Tehran prior to his departure from 
<br>post in October.  Now posted in Vienna, Postl noted that he 
<br>still advises the Austrian government on Iran issues and that 
<br>he was recently asked to see if his contacts in Iran would 
<br>meet with him even though he had departed post.  Many said 
<br>that they would, so he may be asked by the Austrian Foreign 
<br>Ministry to return to Iran periodically to make use of the 
<br>excellent contacts he was afforded given his Farsi skills and 
<br>native Iranian wife. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C)   Postl recounted his final calls on contacts in Iran 
<br>before leaving post, noting that many who had refused 
<br>meetings with him after the elections were now willing to 
<br>meet him.  When he met with former President Khatami, Khatami 
<br>noted that because of the post-election environment, it did 
<br>not make sense to talk about politics.  Postl suggested that 
<br>they discuss the possibility of Khatami pursuing a dialogue 
<br>of civilizations or religions that might give him an opening 
<br>to the West.  Khatami noted that he did want to focus more on 
<br>that kind of dialogue and engagement and that he might come 
<br>to Austria next year in pursuit of such discussions. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>Final Calls Reveal Disillusionment with the 
<br>Possibilities for Change 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C)   Postl noted that in his final calls, he sought out 
<br>a meeting with the new health minister, Marzieh Vahid 
<br>Dastjerdi since he was interested in meeting the Islamic 
<br>Republic's first female minister.  Postl described her as 
<br>"sort of a puppet" and very insecure despite her good 
<br>credentials for the job.  She is a member of the Larijani 
<br>family, giving this influential clan placement in the 
<br>executive branch, in addition to the leverage they hold 
<br>through the key posts of Ali Larijani as Majles Speaker and 
<br>Javad Larijani as head of the Judiciary.  In their meeting, 
<br>Dastjerdi and Postl discussed possible cooperation between 
<br>Iran and Austria in hospitals, training, and person-to-person 
<br>contacts in the medical field. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C)   Postl also called on the powerful new chief of 
<br>President Ahmadinejad's cabinet, Mashaie.  Postl said that 
<br>many believed that Mashaie's rejection for a vice 
<br>presidential post showed that there were disagreements 
<br>between Ahmadinejad and the Supreme Leader, but the fact that 
<br>he was given the slot as head of the cabinet means that 
<br>Khamenei must not be fundamentally opposed to him.  Postl was 
<br>candid with Mashaie, noting that although the Iranian 
<br>elections were an internal matter, the treatment of civilians 
<br>in the aftermath of the elections was wrong by any 
<br>calculation.  Postl assessed that using Farsi instead of 
<br>English made a difference in the reaction he received to this 
<br>candor, and Mashaie said that he would be pleased to meet 
<br>with Postl again if he were in Iran. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>UNVIE VIEN 00000553  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C)   In what Postl believes was the first meeting former 
<br>President Rafsanjani had granted to a Westerner -- and 
<br>perhaps the first meeting with a foreigner -- since the 
<br>elections, the two discussed economic cooperation, which 
<br>Rafsanjani said was his primary focus.  They avoided the 
<br>topics of the election and the nuclear issue, especially 
<br>given the presence of 10 to 15 "watchers" from different 
<br>veins of the Iranian government.  Rafsanjani was very 
<br>interested in non-nuclear energy cooperation and asked very 
<br>detailed questions about wind energy, which Postl said 
<br>Austria would be able to help with.  Rafsanjani also 
<br>discussed his sense of how the Iranian government could 
<br>evolve, arguing that change must come from within Iran and 
<br>that interference from foreigners was not welcome in most 
<br>circumstances.  Nevertheless, Rafsanjani believed that the 
<br>best help possible from foreigners would be to say that the 
<br>elections were not fair and to note the human rights 
<br>violations in the aftermath, though he was not specific about 
<br>what he thought the influence of such statements would be. 
<br>Postl noted that recent months clearly had been hard on 
<br>Rafsanjani; he looked pale and had lost a lot of weight, but 
<br>his eyes were still "active," according to Postl. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C)   Postl described the positions of presidential 
<br>candidates Karrubi and Musavi as children of the revolution 
<br>and argued that neither of them wants systemic change. 
<br>Rather, they hoped to give Iran a "human face."  Since the 
<br>"population of Iran," according to Postl, opposes the Islamic 
<br>system, the people are not very strongly behind either of 
<br>these candidates.  In closing out his comments on his final 
<br>meetings in Tehran, Postl noted that after he departed post, 
<br>his contacts were questioned thoroughly and aggressively, 
<br>which Postl described as a reality of life in Iran and 
<br>contact with a Westerner. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>Infighting and Confusion Driving 
<br>the Nuclear Issue 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C)   In his discussions at the end of September with 
<br>Mashaie, Postl encouraged him to ensure that Iran did not 
<br>"miss the opportunity" presented by the talks in Geneva. 
<br>Mashaie responded that Iran would be "sure to take" advantage 
<br>of this opportunity and told Postl that Postl would be 
<br>surprised at Iran's approach, that Iran would come with 
<br>seriousness and an attitude of compromise.  Postl's 
<br>assessment is that Iran decided that this was the right time 
<br>to show flexibility in order to get an agreement, especially 
<br>since Ahmadinejad wants to claim responsibility for an 
<br>agreement with the West.  Postl believes that Nuclear 
<br>Negotiator Jalili came to Geneva with this spirit of 
<br>compromise and was following direction, presumably from 
<br>Ahmadinejad.  Iran's failure to follow through on these 
<br>agreements may have been due to a decision by Khamenei either 
<br>that the West was not trustworthy despite Iran's supposed 
<br>good intentions or that Iran could get more from the West or 
<br>P5 plus 1 than was offered in Geneva.  Despite the fact that 
<br>people close to the President say he wants "more," the system 
<br>gets in the way as do Ahmadinejad's bad advisers.  Postl's 
<br>interlocutors say that if Ahmadinejad alone were to decide 
<br>about engagement with the West, "things would move more 
<br>quickly."  Postl noted that Khamenei is still respected in 
<br>Iran and, in his personal opinion, there is no essential 
<br>divergence between the Supreme Leader and Ahmadinejad.  On 
<br>issues where the Supreme Leader's opinions were clear, Postl 
<br>argued that other influential Iranians would not "touch on 
<br>issues," even to undercut Ahmadinejad.  The only way to 
<br>challenge these leaders was to focus on "unjust" or 
<br>un-Islamic behavior. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C)   Postl said that Majles Speaker Larijani probably 
<br>was not in favor of the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) deal, 
<br>but when MsnOff questioned whether he really opposed the deal 
<br>or was responding to the fact that Ahmadinejad came out in 
<br>favor of the deal, Postl recounted another possibility tied 
<br>to the post-election environment.  Postl noted that he had 
<br>asked someone close to Larijani whether he was aware of the 
<br>rapes of election-related prisoners.  The interlocutors said 
<br>that not only was Larijani aware, but all officials were 
<br>aware of what was going on inside the prison.  Nevertheless, 
<br>when Larijani spoke publicly about the issue, he stated 
<br>clearly that the rapes are not occurring and thus lost some 
<br>credibility with the Iranian public.  To have not given a 
<br>more ambiguous response, such as that he would look into the 
<br>situation, Larijani must have been under strong pressure from 
<br>above, in Postl's estimation.  Given the clarity that what 
<br>Ahmadinejad had done after the election was wrong and 
<br>Larijani's distaste for Ahmadinejad, the TRR proposal may 
<br>have been Larijani's first opportunity to strike back at 
<br> 
<br>UNVIE VIEN 00000553  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Ahmadinejad. 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C)   Postl also noted that Iran probably has whiplash 
<br>from the international community's response to the Fordow 
<br>Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP), which will complicate our 
<br>efforts to press Iran into compliance with its obligations. 
<br>Although IAEA Director General ElBaradei said after the first 
<br>inspection of the FFEP that it was nothing more than "a hole 
<br>in a mountain," the IAEA Board of Governors passed a 
<br>resolution against Iran, citing the FFEP as one of its main 
<br>points (ref A). Postl argued that this probably leads Iran to 
<br>believe that the international community is not serious about 
<br>the issue, and that, rather, this is "a game." 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C)   One of Postl's contacts close to the Supreme 
<br>Leader pointed him to a Kayhan article from December 1, 
<br>written by editor Shariatmadari, which espouses the views of 
<br>Khamenei on the nuclear issue.  The article argues that Iran 
<br>has gotten nothing from cooperation and should withdraw from 
<br>the NPT immediately.  Since Khamenei has said that he is not 
<br>opposed to an opening with the U.S., it becomes about 
<br>Washington presenting the right arguments at the right time. 
<br>However, Postl said that bringing up the issue of the 
<br>detained Americans at Geneva probably fell flat with the 
<br>Iranians.  Iranian officials told Postl that they were 
<br>surprised that American officials raised this issue at those 
<br>talks.  This was the wrong time to bring up this issue, Postl 
<br>argued, since these issues are not connected in the minds of 
<br>the Iranians.  (We will explain to the Austrians why this 
<br>issue is so important and resonates so much to the U.S.) 
<br>Postl suggested that the UK model was better:  when their 
<br>sailors were captured, UK officials said that this issue had 
<br>nothing to do with the political problems between the two 
<br>countries.  The dissociation of the issues worked in favor of 
<br>getting the sailors released.  Pressed on when might be such 
<br>a right time to address the U.S. detainees, Postl suggested 
<br>that one such way might have been to capitalize on the 
<br>October 1 Geneva talks by following up quickly with a call 
<br>from Under Secretary Burns to Jalili "in the spirit of 
<br>Geneva."  During that phone call, Burns could engage Jalili 
<br>on the detainee issue as an aside.  Postl also noted that 
<br>some of his Iranian government contacts had noted with 
<br>pleasure the appointment of Ambassador Limbert to deal with 
<br>the Iranian file given his understanding of Iran. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>Postl's Tehran Retrospective 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C)   Looking back on his tenure as Ambassador to Iran, 
<br>Postl noted that the biggest "game changer" had been this 
<br>past summer's presidential elections.  The events were 
<br>causing backlash from much of the population.  Parents and 
<br>grandparents were saying, according to Postl, that they do 
<br>not want their children to be forced to experience the same 
<br>Iran that they, themselves, have been living under for the 
<br>last 30 years.  For the first time, one can see "kill 
<br>Khamenei" and "death to Khamenei" scrawled on walls in 
<br>Tehran.  These direct challenges to Khamenei's authority are 
<br>new and significant.  Additionally, Postl expects that the 
<br>population was disillusioned by the overwhelming fraud in the 
<br>elections and many will not vote in the future. 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C)   On engagement, Postl suggested that some ways 
<br>forward for the U.S. and Iran might be to look into using a 
<br>route from Chah Bahar, on Iran's southern coast, to get U.S. 
<br>supplies into Afghanistan and using the assumption of office 
<br>by new IAEA Director General Amano to press for "a new start" 
<br>on the Additional Protocol and additional transparency 
<br>measures discussions. 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C)   Postl reiterated his message that Iranian citizens 
<br>see the Voice of America (VOA) as biased and asked that we 
<br>not underestimate their frustration.  If they see a pervasive 
<br>media outlet as biased, this presents the U.S. in a negative 
<br>light and works against U.S. messaging. He said that Iranians 
<br>currently are faced with two biased choices: VOA and Iranian 
<br>Broadcasting (IRIB).  In response to a MsnOff question about 
<br>how BBC Persian is perceived, he noted that it is seen as 
<br>more neutral, but has the stigma of being associated with the 
<br>UK.  Postl floated the idea of U.S. support to Euro News to 
<br>start broadcasting in Farsi.  He also suggested that doing 
<br>Hardtalk in Persian might be one of the best outlets for U.S. 
<br>arguments since the format of pitting opposing viewpoints 
<br>against one another would counteract the perception of bias, 
<br>but suggested that if our arguments to the Iranian people are 
<br>not convincing, this quickly would become clear.  Finally, 
<br>Postl noted that the U.S. should not shy away from interviews 
<br>with Iranian media outlets, suggesting Press TV because it is 
<br>in English and it is watched in Tehran.  A program built 
<br> 
<br>UNVIE VIEN 00000553  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>around broadcasting the differing opinions of the U.S., India 
<br>(because its opinion is well-respected given its influence as 
<br>a leader in the Nonaligned Movement), and Iran might be a 
<br>useful way to get our messages across while counteracting 
<br>perceptions of bias.
