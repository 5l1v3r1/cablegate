<br>SUBJECT: MORE RUSSIAN RESISTANCE TO DEMARCHE ON MILITARY
<br>SALES TO VENEZUELA
<br>
<br>REF: (A) STATE 165022 (B) MOSCOW 11500
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Kirk Augustine,
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Following up our earlier demarche (refs), Political
<br>Minister Counselor reiterated U.S. concerns regarding arms
<br>sales to Venezuela in a September 13 meeting with Anatoliy
<br>Antonov, MFA Director for Disarmament and Security Affairs.
<br>Focusing on MANPADS, Antonov replied that the Venezuelan
<br>government had not to date requested them. Antonov said that
<br>he and his Department's experts had carefully considered the
<br>points we had presented and had shared them with Russian
<br>services. Antonov noted the MFA would take the U.S. points
<br>into account, along with the evaluations of Russian services,
<br>when a determination on MANPADS sales to Venezuela was
<br>needed.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Nonetheless, Antonov stressed that there was no
<br>international restriction on selling arms, including MANPADS,
<br>to Venezuela. Russia also recognized the U.S. as a
<br>competitor in the international arms trade, with the
<br>motivation of restricting Russia's market access. Russia
<br>respected the U.S. right to determine U.S. policy on arms
<br>sales to Venezuela, but "that is your decision, not ours; we
<br>have our own policy." Antonov said that if U/S Joseph raises
<br>this issue with Deputy FM Kislyak, Kislyak "will say the
<br>same." PolMinCouns noted that the issue of military sales to
<br>Venezuela remained of great concern to the U.S., and this
<br>would be a continuing subject of bilateral discussion.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Regarding sales of AK-103 rifles, Antonov confirmed
<br>that the sale was indeed moving forward. He maintained that
<br>Venezuela was a legitimate market for Russian arms, and that
<br>Russia intends to remain active in this market. He also
<br>commented that the tone in parts of ref A points was
<br>demeaning to Russia. The U.S. should not "speak to us like
<br>we are Gabon or Mali," he remarked. Antonov said that Russia
<br>does not and will not give out specific information, such as
<br>serial numbers of AK-103 rifles, to others.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Comment: There was an explicit rejection of the U.S.
<br>position with regard to the AK-103 rifles, but a less
<br>categorical response on the possibility of a MANPADS sale.
<br>While Antonov's general response on arms sales gave little
<br>grounds for optimism in the event that Venezuela does request
<br>to purchase Russian MANPADS, there may have been enough of a
<br>difference in the tone of his remarks on MANPADS to
<br>constitute a possible opening that can be further explored.
