<br>SUBJECT: (S/REL UK) ARGENTINE REACTION TO POTENTIAL
<br>FALKLAND ISLANDS OIL EXPLORATION (C-TN9-01234)
<br>
<br>Classified By: ELISSA G. PITTERLE, DIRECTOR, INR/OPS
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/REL UK) WASHINGTON ANALYSTS CONTINUE TO MONITOR
<br>DEVELOPMENTS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY CONCERNING POTENTIAL
<br>OFFSHORE OIL EXPLORATION AROUND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS AND THE
<br>POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR ARGENTINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM
<br>(UK). IN APRIL 2009, BUENOS AIRES SUBMITTED TERRITORIAL
<br>CLAIMS TO THE UNITED NATIONS COMMISSION ON THE LIMITS OF THE
<br>CONTINENTAL SHELF THAT INCLUDED THE UNDERSEA AREAS
<br>SURROUNDING THE FALKLAND ISLANDS. IN RESPONSE, LONDON, IN MAY
<br>2009, SUBMITTED ITS OWN CLAIMS IN THE AREA. IN OCTOBER 2009,
<br>UK FIRM DESIRE PETROLEUM REPORTED THAT IT SIGNED A CONTRACT
<br>WITH A U.S. FIRM FOR A DRILLING RIG THAT COULD COMMENCE
<br>OPERATIONS BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY 2010.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/REL UK) ANALYSTS ARE INTERESTED IN GAUGING
<br>ARGENTINA'S POTENTIAL RESPONSE TO OIL COMPANIES BRINGING A
<br>DEEP WATER RIG FOR OIL EXPLORATION OFFSHORE OF THE FALKLAND
<br>ISLANDS. GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN ARGENTINA,
<br>IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ARGENTINA MIGHT USE THE PROSPECTIVE OIL
<br>EXPLORATION IN THE REGION AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSERT ITS
<br>CLAIMS OVER THE ISLANDS AND THE WATERS SURROUNDING IT AND USE
<br>A BELLICOSE STANCE AS A WAY TO DISTRACT THE ARGENTINE
<br>POPULACE FROM ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AT HOME. ANALYSTS WOULD
<br>APPRECIATE REPORTING ON THE ISSUE WHICH WOULD HELP ANALYSTS
<br>ANTICIPATE ARGENTINA'S RESPONSE TO OIL EXPLORATION OFF THE
<br>FALKLAND ISLANDS, INCLUDE POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTIONS.
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) AS TIME, RESOURCES, AND PRESENT WORKLOAD PERMIT, ANY
<br>INFORMATION POST CAN PROVIDE ON THE QUESTIONS BELOW WOULD BE
<br>GREATLY APPRECIATED. MANY THANKS.
<br>
<br>¶A. (S/REL UK) PLEASE REPORT ON ANY ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT OR
<br>MILITARY OFFICIALS' DISCUSSIONS ABOUT PLANNED ACTIONS, ALONE
<br>OR IN CONCERT WITH REGIONAL ALLIES LIKE VENEZUELA, IF AN
<br>OFFSHORE DRILLING RIG BEGINS TO DRILL OFFSHORE THE FALKLAND
<br>ISLANDS. ARE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AWARE OF
<br>POTENTIAL OFFSHORE DRILLING, OR WILL THEY BE SURPRISED WHEN
<br>IT IS ANNOUNCED OR HAPPENS?
<br>
<br>¶B. (S/REL UK) ARE THERE DIVISIONS WITHIN THE ARGENTINE
<br>GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY LEADERSHIP ABOUT A POSSIBLE RESPONSE?
<br>ARE THERE INDICATIONS THAT THIS CAN POTENTIALLY ESCALATE INTO
<br>ANOTHER MILITARY CLASH WITH THE UNITED KINGDOM?
<br>
<br>¶C. (S/REL UK) WHAT DO ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
<br>PERCEIVE TO BE THE COST OF SUPPORTING A BELLICOSE MOVE AS
<br>OPPOSED TO SIMPLY IGNORING THE EVENT?
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) PLEASE CITE C-TN9-01234 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF
<br>REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
