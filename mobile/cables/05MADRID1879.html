<br>SUBJECT: U.S.-SPAIN COUNCIL: MOD BONO EXPRESSES "PERSONAL
<br>OPPOSITION" TO LIFTING EU CHINA ARMS EMBARGO
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Kathy Fitzpatrick; reason 1.4 (B)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The U.S.-Spain Council, a private
<br>bi-national NGO dedicated to strengthening U.S.-Spain
<br>relations, held its tenth annual meeting May 13-16 in
<br>Seville. Participants included U.S. Council Chairman Senator
<br>Chris Dodd, EUR DAS Glyn Davies, Charge Manzanares, Spanish
<br>Minister of Defense Jose Bono, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel
<br>Moratinos, Spain Council Chairman Antonio Garrigues, regional
<br>political officials, and business leaders from both
<br>countries. Prince Felipe hosted a dinner for meeting
<br>participants on the second evening of the event. The most
<br>newsworthy development during the Council meetings was
<br>Minister of Defense Bono's strong, but personal, public
<br>support for maintaining the EU China arms embargo (while
<br>making clear that FM Moratinos had the final word on Spain's
<br>position on the arms embargo) and his acknowledgement that he
<br>may have committed "errors" during his tenure as MOD, a
<br>reference to his statements/measures that have upset
<br>U.S.-Spain bilateral relations. Bono informed Charge that he
<br>had made both comments at the request of Secretary of Defense
<br>Rumsfeld. Separately, Moratinos urged the creation of a
<br>U.S.-Spain bilateral commission to meet at the ministerial
<br>level on an annual basis to discuss regional issues of mutual
<br>concern, as well as recommending other measures to enhance
<br>bilateral relations. While the comments of both ministers
<br>were largely positive, veiled swipes at opposition support
<br>for U.S. policy in Iraq reflected a continuing temptation to
<br>drag the USG into domestic political debates. End Summary.
<br>
<br>//DEFENSE MINISTER ON CHINA ARMS EMBARGO//
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Bono used a speech to participants in the tenth annual
<br>meeting of the U.S.-Spain Council to announce his personal
<br>opposition to the lifting of the EU arms embargo on China.
<br>He said that it did not make sense to lift the arms embargo
<br>now simply because "a particular EU country wants to sell
<br>weapons to China." Bono told Charge privately that he had
<br>made this statement to honor a request made by Secretary
<br>Rumsfeld during their May 3 meeting in Washington that Bono
<br>make public his views on the China arms embargo.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) While Bono was careful to note in his speech that FM
<br>Moratinos had the ultimate word on the China arms issue
<br>within the Spanish government, his comments nonetheless
<br>created a stir during an otherwise routine meeting of the
<br>Council. Charge learned that FM Moratinos and Socialist
<br>Party Director for International Relations Trinidad Jimenez
<br>called Bono after his speech to criticize the way he had
<br>framed the issue. Bono's comments came just hours after
<br>Moratinos' elaboration of a more nuanced position that tracks
<br>with that of its EU allies (see para 9.) Bono's statement
<br>apparently came as a surprise to members of his staff as
<br>well; an MOD contact called Embassy's Spanish-national
<br>political assistant (who was present for the speech) to
<br>verify Bono's declaration.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Separately, Bono said during his speech that he may
<br>have committed "errors" during his tenure as Defense Minister
<br>and attributed these mistakes to his lack of experience in
<br>the MOD role. Bono told Charge that this admission, like his
<br>comments opposing the lifting of the EU China arms embargo,
<br>came at the urging of Secretary Rumsfeld. Bono made clear
<br>that he wanted Secretary Rumsfeld to be informed that he had
<br>complied with both requests.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Bono's comments were not uniformly positive. He said
<br>international peace could not be achieved "without the U.S.
<br>or without the legitimacy (conferred by) the United Nations,"
<br>an implicit defense of the Zapatero government's withdrawal
<br>of troops from Iraq on the grounds that the intervention
<br>lacked a UN mandate. Also, Bono made a general comment to
<br>the effect that his Jesuit education had taught him that "the
<br>ends do not always justify the means." (NOTE: Emboffs in
<br>attendance interpreted this as a veiled criticism of the Iraq
<br>conflict and of the opposition Popular Party's decision to
<br>join the U.S.-led coalition. END NOTE.)
<br>
<br>//FOREIGN MINISTER CALLS FOR FORMATION OF U.S.-SPAIN
<br>BILATERAL COMMISSION//
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) Moratinos made a wide-ranging speech on U.S.-EU
<br>relations and praised President Bush's expression of support
<br>for a strong Europe during his February visit to Brussels.
<br>He said NATO remained Europe's primary security organization
<br>and argued that there was no contradiction between a strong
<br>NATO and the elaboration of a common EU security and defense
<br>policy. Moratinos recommended increased personnel exchanges
<br>between the U.S. and the EU and the formation of an "EU
<br>caucus" in the U.S. Senate as mechanisms for further
<br>strengthening U.S.-EU ties. Moratinos lauded the USG role in
<br>the international community, particularly its part in
<br>resolving the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) The most notable element of Moratinos' speech was his
<br>call for the establishment of a permanent U.S.-Spain
<br>bilateral commission to meet at least once a year at the
<br>ministerial level for discussions on regional issues,
<br>particularly on Latin America, the Middle East, and the
<br>Mediterranean basin. Moratinos suggested other measures for
<br>strengthening U.S.-Spanish relations, including:
<br>
<br>-- joint initiatives to promote shared democratic values in
<br>North Africa and the Middle East;
<br>
<br>-- the reinforcement of institutional contacts, for example
<br>through events such as the June 6-10 visit to Washington by
<br>members of the Spanish Parliamentary Commission on
<br>International Relations;
<br>
<br>-- increased education exchanges to promote mutual
<br>understanding;
<br>
<br>-- the establishment of a joint scientific/industrial
<br>research and development institution; and,
<br>
<br>-- the formation of a joint business organization by private
<br>sector members of the U.S.-Spain Council.
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Moratinos described current U.S.-Spain relations in
<br>positive terms. He noted Spain's participation in
<br>peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia, Kosovo, Haiti, and
<br>Afghanistan and said Spain could be an important partner for
<br>the USG in other areas as well. Moratinos said Spain's
<br>advantages included its place as the world's eight largest
<br>economy ("bigger than that of G-8 member Canada"), its
<br>influence in Latin America, North Africa, and the Middle
<br>East, and Spain's role in the fight against terrorism.
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) While focused on positive aspects of the bilateral
<br>relationship, Moratinos' speech also touched briefly on
<br>points of friction. He said Spain had "recovered the
<br>capacity to engage" the Cuban and Venezuelan governments,
<br>overcoming the tensions those relationships suffered during
<br>the Aznar administration. He insisted that Spain was not
<br>pursuing dialogue as an end in itself, but seeking increased
<br>influence in order to advocate for improved human rights
<br>practices on the part of the Cuban government and to preserve
<br>the rights that still exist in Venezuela. On the EU China
<br>arms embargo, Moratinos noted that any arms sales would be
<br>governed by strict EU controls, but said Beijing had to take
<br>steps to improve human rights conditions before this issue
<br>could move forward.
<br>
<br>//PP PARTICIPANT TAKES SHOTS AT ZAPATERO//
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy declined an
<br>invitation to participate in the Council meetings, but PP
<br>Parliamentary spokesman on international relations Gustavo
<br>Aristegui did attend and mounted a withering attack on
<br>Zapatero's handling of U.S.-Spain relations. Aristegui said
<br>the GOS was now taking steps to correct its early mistakes,
<br>but without publicly acknowledging that it had committed
<br>grave errors. His Socialist counterpart Rafael Estrella
<br>(considered among the more pro-U.S. Socialist
<br>parliamentarians) fired back, asking how the USG would view
<br>it if a former president visited Europe to militate
<br>unceasingly against the policies of an incumbent
<br>administration. (NOTE: Both Aristegui and Estrella will be
<br>part of the Parliamentary delegation that will visit
<br>Washington June 6-10. They have invited Charge to meet with
<br>them prior to their departure to review their agenda for the
<br>visit.)
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) MOD Bono is among the most popular Spanish
<br>politicians and his speech before the U.S.-Spain Council
<br>demonstrated his rhetorical skills. He used the presence of
<br>the media and USG officials to comply with assurances he had
<br>reportedly made to Secretary Rumsfeld, while leaving to FM
<br>Moratinos the unpleasant duty of clarifying Spain's official
<br>position on the EU China arms embargo. For now, the GOS has
<br>evidently opted not to clarify the matter publicly in order
<br>to avoid the appearance of internal discord. More broadly,
<br>we note that both Bono and Moratinos continue to fight a
<br>two-front political battle with the opposition PP, on the one
<br>hand claiming that relations with the USG are as strong as
<br>ever, and on the other casting PP support for USG policies in
<br>Iraq as somehow illegitimate and contrary to international
<br>law. GOS officials have clearly tempered their public
<br>statements on Iraq in the last five months, but our efforts
<br>to keep them from dragging the USG into their domestic
<br>political battles remain a work in progress.
