<br>SUBJECT: SAUDI AIRSTRIKES AT YEMEN BORDER 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Stephen Seche for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY. Local sources confirm that Saudi Arabia
<br>continued to launch airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Jebel
<br>al-Dukhan area on the Saudi-Yemeni border, despite ROYG
<br>statements to the contrary. In an unusual twist, the Houthis
<br>are now casting themselves as defenders of Yemen's
<br>sovereignty against an unwarranted Saudi attack, while
<br>President Saleh's public remarks point to his delight that
<br>the KSA has officially joined his war against the Houthis.
<br>While Saudi airstrikes may succeed in driving the Houthis
<br>from some of their border strongholds, they are unlikely to
<br>have much impact on the Sa'ada war without an accompanying
<br>ground invasion. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>Local sources: saudi airstrikes continue, but where?
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In response to Houthi incursions into Saudi territory
<br>and a November 2 Houthi attack on Saudi border guards, Saudi
<br>Arabia continued to launch airstrikes against Houthi rebels
<br>in the Jebel al-Dukhan area on the Saudi-Yemeni border, local
<br>sources told PolOffs in early November. In contradiction to
<br>AP reports that Saudi Arabia regained control of contested
<br>Jebel al-Dukhan on November 8, the Houthis denied that the
<br>Saudis had taken the mountain, claiming they were still in
<br>control. Also on November 8, a ROYG aircraft crashed in
<br>Razih district (which borders Saudi Arabia to the north of
<br>Malahit); the Houthis took credit for downing it, while the
<br>ROYG claimed mechanical failure. Independent Yemeni
<br>journalists report that, contrary to official Saudi
<br>statements, Saudi airplanes have entered Yemeni airspace and
<br>hit targets inside of Yemen.xxxxx told PolOff on November 6 that the Saudi
<br>Air Force bombed Tihana, Malahit, and Hasama districts within
<br>Yemen. He also reported the Saudis were massing troops
<br>stationed near the border.xxxxx confirmed that airstrikes have occurred in Yemeni
<br>territory. "The Yemeni government denies this, but the Saudi
<br>government is acting in full coordination with the Yemeni
<br>government," he told PolOff on November 6.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) The Houthis, too, have accused the Saudi Air Force
<br>of bombing Yemeni territory, including residential areas in
<br>al-Hattamah, al-Malahit, al-Hassamah, al-Majda'ah, and
<br>Ghamar, killing and wounding civilians in the latter. The
<br>Houthis also claimed to have captured some Saudi soldiers,
<br>which the SAG denied. (Note:xxxxx promised to air footage of the captured
<br>Saudi soldiers, but none has been broadcast to date. End
<br>Note.) UNHCR Representative Claire Bourgeois told PolOff
<br>that 135 families fleeing the area caught in the conflict
<br>arrived at the Mazraq IDP camp in Hajja governorate on
<br>November 7. "Seven hundred people - this is a huge increase
<br>in one day," she said. (Comment: Bourgeois expects a report
<br>from UNHCR on November 10 with the recent arrivals'
<br>eye-witness accounts from the conflict zone, which could
<br>provide more clarity on the fighting. End Comment.)
<br>
<br>Border confusion...
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) According to xxxxx, the contested area in Jebel
<br>al-Dukhan is officially part of Saudi Arabia, but when the
<br>border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia was drawn through the
<br>area, it cut through the territory that had traditionally
<br>belonged to a Zaydi Yemeni tribe. He told PolOff on November
<br>8 that because "tribal territories transcend international
<br>borders," the tribes living in that area consider it Yemeni
<br>even if it is officially Saudi. Furthermore, while the
<br>members of the tribe whose territory straddles the two
<br>countries identify first and foremost with their tribe, they
<br>identify secondly as Yemenis, not Saudis - regardless of
<br>which side of the border they live on. Adding to the
<br>confusion about whether Jebel al-Dukhan falls in Yemeni or
<br>Saudi territory is the fact that ROYG forces continue to
<br>fight throughout the area.
<br>
<br>... And allegations of cross-border collaboration
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) xxxxx believes there was probably an agreement
<br>between the ROYG and KSA to encircle the Houthis by attacking
<br>them simultaneously from the north and the south. According
<br>to xxxxx the SAG had granted the ROYG military access to
<br>Jebel al-Dukhan in order to gain leverage over the Houthis,
<br>but the Houthis were able to rout them, so the Saudis
<br>launched airstrikes to clear Houthis from the area. The
<br>Houthis claimed to take control of Jebel al-Dukhan on
<br>November 2. In a telephone interview with al-Jazeera xxxxx accused the Saudis of
<br>allowing the Yemeni military to access Jebel al-Dukhan from
<br>the Saudi border in order to launch a counter-offensive to
<br>re-take the mountain. xxxxx said, "We do not target Saudi
<br>territory and we are not fighting them in their territory or
<br>in the areas under their control. The problem is that we are
<br>facing aggression, and there is clear cooperation between the
<br>Saudi regime and the Yemeni regime."
<br>
<br>Houthis: we are defending yemen's sovereignty
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) In an unusual twist, the Houthis are now casting
<br>themselves as defenders of Yemen's sovereignty and
<br>territorial integrity. In a November 6 statement, the
<br>Houthis accused the Saudis of launching a ground offensive
<br>into Yemen after heavy bombardment of the Malahit and
<br>Hassamah regions. The Houthis continued to deny having any
<br>presence in Saudi territory and claimed that "the Yemeni
<br>people will take a stand regarding these infringements on
<br>Yemen's sovereignty, and we hold the Saudi authorities fully
<br>responsible for the results of these uncalled for
<br>infringements on Yemen's sovereignty and territories."
<br>
<br>Saleh: the war in sa'ada has only just begun
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Local observers report that President Saleh is
<br>thrilled that the Saudis have become militarily involved in
<br>the conflict. Saleh's enthusiasm was evident in his November
<br>7 speech at a ceremony launching the first shipment of
<br>Yemen's liquefied natural gas project. He said the "real
<br>war" against the Houthis had begun only two days before )
<br>the day the Saudi airstrikes began. He described the
<br>previous six rounds of the Sa'ada war as "a rehearsal to test
<br>our capabilities," adding that the war will not end until the
<br>Houthis are crushed entirely. Abdullah Ahmed Ghanem, Chief
<br>of the Political Department of the ruling General People's
<br>Congress (GPC) party, agreed that Saudi involvement was a
<br>positive development. He told PolOff on November 9 that
<br>"Yemeni-Saudi relations are very good now, and because of
<br>this war they're going to get better and better. The Houthis
<br>are our joint enemy."
<br>
<br>Yemenis weight in: what to expect from saudi involvement
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) xxxxx suspects the ROYG approached the Saudis and
<br>asked for their support because it is suffering tremendous
<br>losses in Sa'ada. According to xxxxx military sources, the
<br>ROYG has lost scores of military positions in Sa'ada
<br>governorate. "It's a big fiasco," he said, "and that's why
<br>(Saleh) wants Saudi involvement." xxxxx also noted that
<br>President Saleh is increasingly losing faith in his own
<br>military, which is another reason he needs Saudi help. The
<br>President has placed trusted family members at the helm of
<br>campaigns to retake embattled Malahit and Sa'ada City.
<br>According to Aden Press, President Saleh put his son Ahmad
<br>Ali Abdullah Saleh, commander of the Republican Guard, in
<br>charge of the military campaign in Malahit, taking it out of
<br>the hands of the ROYG military's Northwest Region commander
<br>Ali Muhsin. According to DAO reporting, the Ministry of
<br>Interior's (MOI) Yemeni Central Security Force )
<br>Counterterrorism Unit (CSF-CTU), led by presidential nephew
<br>Yahya Muhammad Abdullah Saleh, has been tasked with
<br>formulating an operational plan for clearing the Houthis from
<br>their stronghold in the old quarter of Sa'ada City.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Some observers, such as xxxxx, believe
<br>Saudi military involvement will bring the war to a swifter
<br>conclusion. But others do not see Saudi involvement as a
<br>silver bullet. xxxxx expects Saudi involvement to continue,
<br>pointing to media reports that KSA is massing ground troops
<br>at the Saudi-Yemen border. In his view, the "big
<br>mobilization" of troops signals the intention to be engaged
<br>for a long time. He does not see a quick end to the war,
<br>though, because it has expanded to include tribes whose
<br>territories span the Saudi-Yemeni border. With the tribal
<br>dynamics of blood feuds and revenge killings, "the Saudis
<br>have gotten themselves caught in a big swamp" from which it
<br>will be hard to extract themselves, he believes.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>¶10. (C) By all accounts, the ROYG has welcomed Saudi
<br>involvement against the Houthis. The ROYG is likely to
<br>encourage the Saudis to deepen their involvement, perhaps by
<br>taking action in border areas north of Jebel al-Dukhan still
<br>under Houthi control. While Saudi involvement may succeed in
<br>driving the Houthis from some of their border strongholds, it
<br>is unlikely to substantially weaken them or have an impact on
<br>the overall war in Sa'ada. Continued Saudi military
<br>operations in the border regions could actually fuel the war,
<br>since the local populations have a great deal of distrust for
<br>central government authority, whether Saudi or Yemeni. END
