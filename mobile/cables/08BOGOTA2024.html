<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Most GOC officials and outside analysts believe the
<br>death of FARC founder Pedro Marin (Manuel Marulanda) will
<br>have little impact on the FARC's approach to a humanitarian
<br>hostage exchange or broader peace talks with the GOC. Peace
<br>Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo called new FARC leader
<br>Guillermo Saenz (Alfonso Cano) a "Leninist ideologue" who
<br>will need to consolidate his leadership position. Polo
<br>Democratico official Daniel Garcia Pena agreed Cano is
<br>committed to "all forms of struggle," and predicted he will
<br>try to strengthen ties with Venezuela. Restrepo and other
<br>observers speculated that Marulanda's death will accelerate
<br>desertions and fragmentation within the FARC, creating
<br>opportunities for the GOC to pursue deals with individual
<br>commanders. End Summary
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---
<br>Marulanda's Death: Improved Prospects for Peace?
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The death of FARC founder and long-time leader Pedro
<br>Marin (Manuel Marulanda) has triggered speculation about what
<br>this means for the FARC's approach to a humanitarian hostage
<br>exchange, prospects for broader GOC-FARC peace talks, and the
<br>FARC's military strategy. In the immediate aftermath of
<br>Marulanda's death, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner
<br>said Marulanda's death "raises great hope" and urged new FARC
<br>leader Alfonso Cano to release the FARC's civilian hostages.
<br>Similarly, Yolanda Pulecio, mother of FARC hostage and former
<br>presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, called Cano a
<br>"cultured and progressive man" and said any FARC move to
<br>release the hostages would be well-received by the
<br>international community.
<br>
<br>--------------------
<br>Or More of the Same?
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Still, in its May 27 communique acknowledging
<br>Marulanda's death--and the appointment of Guillero Saenz
<br>(Alfonso Cano) as his successor--the FARC ratified its
<br>proposal conditioning humanitarian exchange talks on the
<br>GOC's demilitarization of Florida and Pradera municipalities.
<br>GOC Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo told us May 30
<br>that Marulanda's death will not lead to any progress on a
<br>humanitarian accord or peace process in the near future.
<br>Cano is a "Leninist ideologue" who founded the Colombian
<br>Clandestine Communist Party and the Bolivarian Movement. In
<br>the short-term, he will need to consolidate his position and
<br>will not be able to show any sign of weakness. In fact,
<br>Restrepo said Cano may push for heightened military action to
<br>show he is in charge.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Restrepo downplayed the notion of a rivalry between
<br>Cano and FARC military leader Jorge Briceno (Mono Jojoy),
<br>noting that Cano's political hard-line complements Jojoy's
<br>military toughness. It would have been more difficult for
<br>Cano to assert control if Raul Reyes, who saw himself as the
<br>FARC's political leader, were still alive. Restrepo
<br>dismissed the other Secretariat members as lacking stature,
<br>saying the Secretariat is effectively a Cano-Jojoy
<br>organization. New Secretariat member Jorge Torres (Pablo
<br>Catatumbo) functions as Cano's secretary; Milton Toncel
<br>(Joaquin Gomez) will follow Jojoy's line; Rodrigo Londono
<br>(Timochenko) is an "errand boy" who does not command any
<br>troops and lives in Venezuela; and Luciano Marin (Ivan
<br>Marquez) also spends most of his time in Venezuela.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Former Peace Commissioner for Presidents Barco and
<br>Gaviria Carlos Eduardo Jaramillo told us the FARC identified
<br>Cano as Marulanda's eventual successor near the end of the
<br>Caguan process. He agreed with Restrepo's assessment that
<br>the FARC would not change its strategy in the short-term,
<br>noting that "the Secretariat functions as a collegial
<br>decision-making body." Marulanda's death signals a
<br>
<br>generational shift in the FARC leadership, with power passing
<br>from the peasant founders to more urban, Communist Party
<br>educated leaders who were active in protest movements in the
<br>1970s, but the group's commitment to armed confrontation is
<br>unlikely to change.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Polo Secretary General and former President Samper
<br>peace advisor Daniel Garcia Pena also predicted Marulanda's
<br>death will mean little to the FARC's day-to-day management of
<br>the war. Marulanda was a FARC icon and unifying figure, but
<br>the transition to Cano--who was Marulanda's choice--was
<br>relatively smooth. The murder of Secretariat member Manuel
<br>Munoz (Ivan Rios) by his own men and the desertion of Nelly
<br>Avila (Karina) were bigger blows to the group because of what
<br>they say about FARC morale. Garcia Pena views Cano as an
<br>intransigent ideologue who is less pragmatic than Jojoy and
<br>is committed to "all forms of struggle." He added that the
<br>FARC has yet to name a replacement for Raul Reyes as head of
<br>the FARC's International Relations Department, making any
<br>change in position on a humanitarian accord more difficult.
<br>Restrepo noted that the disruption of the FARC's
<br>international network after Reyes' death will also complicate
<br>any FARC shifts on an exchange.
<br>
<br>----------------
<br>FARC-Chavez Ties
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Garcia Pena expects Cano to try to strengthen the
<br>FARC's political ties with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,
<br>since Chavez provided the group important "political oxygen"
<br>before the Colombian military attack on the Reyes camp in
<br>Ecuador. Chavez will need to be careful about supporting the
<br>FARC given the Reyes computer files, but Chavez and important
<br>sectors of his movement continue to see the FARC as a
<br>potential military ally in the event of a U.S. invasion.
<br>Hence, Chavez will continue to look for ways to help the FARC
<br>and, to a lesser extent, the ELN. Restrepo also believes
<br>Chavez will continue to help the group, but said Marulanda's
<br>historical role held a special attraction for Chavez. With
<br>his passing, Chavez would no longer have an interlocutor of
<br>equal stature within the FARC.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>Prospects for Increased FARC Desertions, Fragmentation
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Prior to Marulanda's death, local ICRC delegate
<br>Barbara Hintermann said the increasing Colombian military
<br>pressure on the FARC was disrupting Secretariat
<br>command-and-control over FARC fronts, giving greater autonomy
<br>to individual FARC commanders and leading to more desertions.
<br>She speculated that the death of FARC Secretariat members
<br>Raul Reyes and Ivan Rios would accelerate FARC desertions,
<br>including some senior FARC officials. Presidential advisor
<br>Jose Obdulio Gaviria told us Marulanda's demise completes the
<br>Secretariat's disintegration. The Secretariat's members
<br>cannot communicate or take decisions. Only Cano and Jojoy
<br>give it a sense of national structure and international
<br>projection. He said the GOC needs to try to negotiate a
<br>partial peace deal with Jojoy--who he considers more
<br>reasonable than Cano--or to seek deals with individual front
<br>commanders.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Restrepo told us that on May 22, he spoke with FARC
<br>commander Jose Cabrera (Fabian Ramirez) who questioned
<br>Restrepo about the legal benefits he might receive if he were
<br>to turn himself in with Ingrid Betancourt. Ramirez said he
<br>did not have physical control of Ingrid, but implied he might
<br>be able to negotiate her release as well. Restrepo noted
<br>that Ramirez' profile--substantial narcotics wealth managed
<br>by his family, unhappiness with his superiors, and concern
<br>about the FARC's future--applies to other FARC commanders
<br>such as 1st Front commander Gerardo Aguilar (Cesar). He
<br>promised to keep us posted as the Ramirez situation evolves.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>The ELN Path: Internal Division and Military Decline
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>¶10. Former Foreign Minister and current Cambio editor
<br>
<br>Rodrigo Pardo speculated that Marulanda's passing opens the
<br>prospect that the FARC will end up like the ELN after the
<br>death of "Father Manuel Perez" in 1998. Without its
<br>long-time leader, the ELN has entered a steady process of
<br>decline, characterized by internal divisions, diminishing
<br>military capacity, and erratic participation in peace
<br>processes with the GOC.
