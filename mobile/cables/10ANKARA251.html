<br>SUBJECT: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GATES'S MEETINGS WITH TURKISH 
<br>MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENSE AND CHIEF OF THE TURKISH 
<br>GENERAL STAFF, FEBRUARY 6, 2010 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador James F. Jeffrey for reason 1.4 (b, d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary:  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates 
<br>(SecDef) met with Turkish Minister of National Defense Mehmet 
<br>Vecdi Gonul (MND Gonul) and the Chief of the Turkish Genral 
<br>Staff General Ilker Basbug (Gen Basbug) in separate meetings 
<br>during his bilateral visit to Ankara on February 6, 2010. 
<br>SecDef thanked Gonul and Basbug for Turkey's valuable 
<br>contributions in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Gonul stressed 
<br>Turkey's important role in Afghanistan as a Muslim country in 
<br>the Alliance and Basbug hailed continuing U.S. and Turkish 
<br>support to Afghan National Security Force training and 
<br>assistance to the Pakistani Armed Forces.  SecDef and Gonul 
<br>discussed the importance of a Turkish role in European 
<br>Missile Defense.  On combating the PKK in Turkey, SecDef 
<br>agreed with Basbug that the key to further progress is 
<br>greater Iraqi cooperation with Turkey. SecDef highlighted to 
<br>Gonul opportunities to increase military capability and gain 
<br>economic benefits through choosing Sikorsky helicopters or 
<br>Raytheon Patriot PAC-3 systems in ongoing tenders. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>Bilateral Relationship 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) MND Gonul stressed the importance of the SecDef's 
<br>visit, noting that it built on the Prime Minister's December 
<br>meeting in Washington with President Obama in December. 
<br>SecDef agreed on the importance of the bilateral 
<br>relationship, and recalled that Turkish-American solidarity 
<br>extended from the Korean War through the present in 
<br>Afghanistan.  SecDef said he believed that Turkey was 
<br>undervalued as an Ally by many Europeans. 
<br> 
<br>----------- 
<br>Afghanistan 
<br>----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) In both meetings SecDef conveyed U.S. appreciation 
<br>for Turkey's contributions to Afghanistan -- including 
<br>providing troops, OMLTs, POMLTs, a PRT, commanding 
<br>RC-Capital, providing access through the Incirlik air base, 
<br>and allowing the transit of non-lethal goods to Afghanistan 
<br>through Turkish air space.  Regarding Turkey's contributions 
<br>to ISAF, GEN Basbug said that "we are trying to do our best" 
<br>with the PRT in Wardak province and command of RC-Capital. 
<br>He observed that the hardest aspect of the fight against the 
<br>Taliban was differentiating between the real Taliban and 
<br>those that merely helped or supported the Taliban or even 
<br>indigenous forces not aligned with the Taliban.  However, 
<br>Basbug was hopeful that Allies could win over some of those 
<br>who were sympathetic to the Taliban through a reintegration 
<br>strategy. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Gonul emphasized that Turkey had a "special 
<br>connection" with the people of Afghanistan due to common 
<br>Islamic roots.  Turkey's involvement in ISAF offered a way of 
<br>refuting insurgents' attempts to use Islam as ideological 
<br>justification for their efforts.  SecDef agreed that having 
<br>Muslim soldiers participate in ISAF drives home the fact that 
<br>the fight in Afghanistan is not against Islam but rather 
<br>against terrorists who "pervert Islam." 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Basbug was upbeat about prospects for success in 
<br>Afghanistan, noting that the positive tone of GEN 
<br>McChrystal's brief at the NATO CHODs conference had inspired 
<br>more optimism among his colleagues than had his original 
<br>September brief on his assessment.  SecDef said he agreed 
<br>with McChrystal's latest assessment that the situation was 
<br>serious but no longer deteriorating, but warned that no one 
<br>should exaggerate how well things were going.  At the 
<br>Istanbul Ministerial as well, he said, there had clearly been 
<br>a change in mood among the Ministers present.  Significantly, 
<br>Defense Minister Wardak had told him that for the first time 
<br>he had begun to hope for a successful outcome in Afghanistan. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Basbug described the terrorist attacks in Kabul on 
<br>January 18th as serious, but said that the ANSF response 
<br>ultimately offered an "outstanding" example of how to manage 
<br>a very complex operation.  Nine terrorists were killed and 
<br>two were captured, and the terrorists did not ultimately 
<br>achieve their objectives.  Describing post-attack operations 
<br>as "a cause for optimism," Basbug said that the Afghan forces 
<br>involved showed they were motivated, well disciplined, and 
<br>well prepared for the fight.  Basbug then reviewed Turkey's 
<br>plans for training the ANA and the ANP, stressing that the 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>priority was to provide unit training both in Turkey and in 
<br>Afghanistan.  So far, he said, Turkey had trained three 
<br>Afghan companies and would open a training center in Kabul to 
<br>do battalion-level training soon. 
<br> 
<br>-------- 
<br>Pakistan 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S/NF) Basbug also raised Pakistan, recalling his October 
<br>visit at the invitation of General Kayani.  During his visit 
<br>to Swat province he had witnessed a hundred-fold improvement 
<br>in security since his previous visit, citing the return of 
<br>civilian populations to the region as a clear success for 
<br>Pakistani forces.  Sec Def agreed, observing that the degree 
<br>of success by Pakistani forces ran counter to all of our 
<br>intelligence predictions. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Basbug highlighted the TGF's support for Pakistan's 
<br>armed forces - especially on logistics and maintenance of 
<br>equipment, including spare parts for their Air Force.  He 
<br>said that although overall relationships with Pakistan were 
<br>sometimes difficult, cooperation remained solid at the 
<br>military level. 
<br> 
<br>---------------- 
<br>Counterterrorism 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (S/NF) Basbug raised the issue of Turkey's protracted 
<br>fight against the PKK, highlighting progress over the past 
<br>year due to the elimination of key leaders, divisions within 
<br>PKK ranks, and dwindling morale of PKK fighters.  This 
<br>progress, Basbug said, was the result of increased 
<br>U.S.-Turkish cooperation since the end of 2007, including 
<br>intelligence sharing, provision of ISR support, and use U.S. 
<br>UAV assets in Northern Iraq.  Basbug concluded by requesting 
<br>additional support from the United States government, Iraqi 
<br>government, and KRG.  Drawing a parallel to U.S. actions in 
<br>the cross-border region of Pakistan, Basbug said that in 
<br>order to continue to eliminate the PKK threat, Turkey needs 
<br>more support from all stakeholders to pursue the top PKK 
<br>leadership. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (S/NF) Addressing Turkey's outstanding Reaper UAV 
<br>requests, SecDef reaffirmed to Basbug that the U.S. is 
<br>committed to the sale of Reapers to Turkey, but offered the 
<br>caveat that the sale would first have to be approved by 
<br>Congress.  SecDef added that the Pentagon is also looking at 
<br>additional reconnaissance capabilities in addition to the 
<br>Predators currently flown by the U.S.  The U.S. he said, is 
<br>considering some UAVs with shorter dwell times, which have 
<br>proven to be effective in Iraq.  Regarding current UAV 
<br>support -- which already provides an average of 16-17 hours 
<br>of coverage daily -- SecDef said that Gen Odierno will look 
<br>at ways to surge up to 24-hour coverage when necessary, e.g. 
<br>for operations involving high-value targets. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S/NF) SecDef emphasized that Turkey's dialogue with KRG 
<br>was very important.  In his meeting the previous week with 
<br>KRG President Barzani, SecDef said he pressed him once again 
<br>to work with the PKK to persuade them to abandon violence. 
<br>Basbug agreed and said Turkey's dialogue with the KRG was 
<br>particularly important as a measure to persuade the KRG to 
<br>take a more proactive approach to the PKK. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S/NF) Basbug expressed concern about the U.S. drawdown 
<br>of forces from Iraq, lamenting that while Turkey has been 
<br>successful in reducing the PKK threat, it will be difficult 
<br>to finish off the threat after U.S forces leave.  He 
<br>concluded that Turkey would need to "finish the problem" 
<br>before the U.S. drawdown was complete. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>Missile Defense and Iran 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S/NF) MND Gonul said he considered the new US Phased 
<br>Adaptive approach better than the previous Administration's 
<br>approach, since the previous system did not cover Turkey. 
<br>SecDef agreed, noting that the Polish and Romanian agreement 
<br>to host SM-3 missiles.  He further emphasized that without a 
<br>radar based in Turkey, significant areas in the eastern part 
<br>of the country would not be covered by the system. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S/NF) Gonul told SecDef that discussions about the radar 
<br>were ongoing within the Turkish government and inquired about 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>what alternate sites the U.S. was considering.  SecDef 
<br>responded that other countries in Southeast Europe might be 
<br>interested in hosting the radar, but reiterated that Turkey 
<br>was the optimal site.  SecDef explained that one of the 
<br>reasons why he had embraced the new administration's approach 
<br>was that it provided protection for Allies and troops earlier 
<br>than the previous program without reducing protection of the 
<br>U.S. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (S/NF) Turning to Iran, Gonul cited the enrichment 
<br>program and acknowledged that Ankara is "concerned about the 
<br>Iranian threat," but said that the international community 
<br>does not yet have evidence that there is a weapons program. 
<br>Gonul said that even though Turkey does not expect an attack 
<br>from Iran, the threat from Iran to Turkey's European allies 
<br>would make an air defense capability important. (Comment: His 
<br>acknowledgement of an Iranian threat to Europe diverges from 
<br>previous Turkish statements underplaying such a threat.)  He 
<br>repeated that the system would be designed to defend all of 
<br>Europe, and not solely Turkey. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (S/NF) SecDef counseled that if Iran goes forward with a 
<br>nuclear weapons program, other states in the region were 
<br>likely to proliferate as well.  Additionally, there was a 
<br>good chance Israelis would at some point decide that military 
<br>action was necessary.  As Turkey would inevitably be unable 
<br>to sit out on any conflict in the region, it is important to 
<br>be prepared militarily and Ankara should not hesitate to 
<br>acquire defensive systems, even as the international 
<br>community works to stop Iran's efforts. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>Acquisition Advocacy 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C//NF) During his meeting with Gonul, SecDef advised 
<br>that Turkey had opportunities to increase its military 
<br>capabilities while gaining economic benefits by selecting 
<br>U.S. companies in currently open tenders.  First, Sikorsky, 
<br>was prepared to guarantee that for every helicopter produced 
<br>in Turkey and bought by Turkey, Sikorsky would produce a 
<br>second helicopter in Turkey for export.  SecDef explained 
<br>that in addition to providing modern equipment for Turkey, 
<br>this offer would provide hundreds of millions of dollars in 
<br>export revenue.  Gonul replied that Sikorsky had told him 
<br>Turkey was the largest consumer of Sikorsky helicopters after 
<br>the U.S. and that Turkey already was buying 70 Sea Hawk 
<br>helicopters (as well as 14 heavy lift helos (CH-47s) from 
<br>Boeing).  The tender for the new project had been running for 
<br>two years and the short list included Sikorsky and an Italian 
<br>company.  Gonul believes Sikorsky has a good chance to win. 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C/NF) A second opportunity involves the co-production of 
<br>Raytheon PAC-3 Patriot systems.  Demand for these systems in 
<br>the Gulf States could potentially yield hundreds of millions 
<br>of dollars in export revenue.  SecDef stressed that "nothing 
<br>can compete with the PAC-3 when it comes to capabilities." 
<br>These opportunities are a chance for Turkey to earn revenue 
<br>while simultaneously enhancing capabilities and creating 
<br>jobs. 
<br> 
<br>¶19.  (C/NF) Gonul said this competition right now was between 
<br>the U.S., Russia and China, but noted that French MoD Morin 
<br>had indicated in Istanbul that the French would also make a 
<br>bid including co-production arrangements.  Gonul observed 
<br>that as this was an expensive project and he had limited 
<br>familiarity with the PAC-3: he needed to be careful to make 
<br>the right choice. SecDef pointed out that the Raytheon 
<br>package would be easier to integrate with the command and 
<br>control of the U.S. and others using the same system. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>Joint Strike Fighter 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) Gonul said Turkey was pleased to be part of the joint 
<br>Strike Fighter (JSF) program and noted his belief that it was 
<br>important for Turkey to have maintenance facilities in 
<br>Turkey.  SD remarked that because the program was recently 
<br>restructured, cost estimates were now realistic.  SecDef 
<br>noted he had directed the JSF program manager to put 
<br>additional funding in the FY2011 and FY2012 budget for JSF. 
<br>However, because of contractor delays, the timeline had 
<br>slipped about a year.  In conclusion, Gonul raised Turkey's 
<br>F-16 modernization program and expressed concern that new 
<br>upgrades precluded Turkish access to computer systems and 
<br>software modification previously allowed.  Turkish Under 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Secretary for Industry Bayar told SecDef he would pursue this 
<br>issue in greater detail with Under Secretary of Defense for 
<br>Acquisition Ash Carter. 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (U) SecDef has cleared this cable.  Drafted by OSD staff.
