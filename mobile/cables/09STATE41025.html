<br>Classified By: SUZANNE MCCORMICK, DIR., INR/OPS. REASON: 1.4(C). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) INR/B OFFICERS GREATLY APPRECIATE POST'S CABLES THAT CONTAIN IN-DEPTH PROFILES ON, AND THE POLITICAL STRATEGIES OF, LIKELY CONTENDERS IN THE 2010 PRESIDENTIAL RACE, PARTICULARLY THE STELLAR REPORTING ON SAO PAULO STATE GOVERNOR AND PRESIDENTIAL FRONTRUNNER JOSE SERRA, AS NOTED IN REFS A AND B. THE INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS ALREADY HAVE BEEN USED IN BRIEFINGS AND BIOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS FOR KEY CUSTOMERS, AND WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO OTHER ANALYSES AS THE ELECTION NEARS. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C/NF) INR/B OFFICERS HAVE BENEFITED FROM POST'S INCLUSION OF BIOGRAPHIC PARAGRAPHS ON ENVIRONMENT MINISTER CARLOS MINC AND ITAMARATY'S RECENTLY-APPOINTED POINT-PERSON ON CLIMATE CHANGE, VERA MACHADO, AS NOTED IN REFS C AND D. THIS INFORMATION HELPS TO FILL BIOGRAPHIC GAPS ON KEY PLAYERS ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY--A KEY BILATERAL ISSUE-AND WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO PENDING BIOS FOR US OFFICIALS AND OTHER PRODUCTS. BIOGRAPHIC OFFICERS COMMEND POST FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO INCLUDING THESE USEFUL PIECES OF INFORMATION IN CABLES WHENEVER POSSIBLE. WE ESPECIALLY VALUE INFORMATION ON LEADERS' OPERATING STYLES, DEMEANORS, MOTIVATIONS, STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPERIORS, SENSITIVITIES, WORLDVIEWS, HOBBIES, AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) INR/B OFFICERS HAVE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS INCLUDED INFORMATION IN BIOS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FROM POST'S IN-DEPTH REPORTING ON CORRUPTION CASES, AS NOTED IN REF E. BIOGRAPHIC OFFICERS WOULD WELCOME FRESH UPDATES, PARTICULARLY AS THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION NEARS, AS SCANDALS RISK UNDERMINING CANDIDATES' CAMPAIGNS. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) INR/B OFFICERS HAVE WELCOMED REPORTING THAT ADDRESSES INTERACTIONS INVOLVING, AND CLEAVAGES BETWEEN, BRAZILIAN LEADERS ON KEY ECONOMIC, FOREIGN POLICY, AND POLITICAL ISSUES. MUCH OF THIS REPORTING PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US OFFICIALS TO IDENTIFY FAVORABLE INTERLOCUTORS (OR OBSTACLES) TO US OBJECTIVES ON PRIORITY ISSUES, SUCH AS ENERGY AND TRADE/PROTECTIONISM, AS NOTED IN REFS F AND H. BIOGRAPHIC OFFICERS WOULD APPRECIATE FURTHER REPORTING ON DIVISIONS INSIDE PRESIDENT LULA'S ECONOMIC INNER CIRCLE ON POLICIES AIMED AT TACKLING BRAZIL'S ECONOMIC WOES--PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT WOULD AFFECT MULTILATERAL AND US-BRAZIL TRADE POLICIES. WE WOULD ALSO WELCOME INFORMATION ON THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS, THEIR NEGOTIATING STYLES, AND THEIR LEVELS AND BREADTH OF AUTHORITY. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) INR/B OFFICERS APPRECIATE REPORTING THAT IDENTIFIES KEY POLICIES THAT ORIGINATE IN PLANALTO PALACE RATHER THAN IN TRADITIONALLY-POWERFUL MINISTRIES, SUCH AS THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, AS NOTED IN REF G. BIOGRAPHIC OFFICERS WOULD WELCOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE IDENTITIES OF PLANALTO OFFICIALS BEHIND SPECIFIED INITIATIVES, AS SUCH INFORMATION HELPS THEM TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE, WORLDVIEWS, AND POLICY STANCES OF KEY LEADERS. MANY THANKS AGAIN, AND REGARDS FROM WASHINGTON.
