<br>
<br>REF: A. MADRID 1257
<br>¶B. MADRID 1226
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Arnold A. Chacon, for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Presidency Secretary-General Bernardino Leon
<br>confirmed in a December 22 dinner with the Ambassador
<br>that President Zapatero has tasked him with ensuring
<br>that Russian (and partly U.S.-owned) oil company
<br>Lukoil's pending purchase of a sizable stake in Spain's
<br>Repsol takes place on politically acceptable terms. Leon
<br>is seeking to limit Lukoil to purchasing the 20 percent
<br>stake of Repsol owned by troubled construction company Sacyr
<br>Vallehermoso, rather than the almost 30 percent it had
<br>originally sought (reftels), so that Lukoil will not become
<br>Repsol's most influential shareholder. Zapatero wants to see
<br>the sale of Sacyr's stake go through in order to help Sacyr,
<br>which has more than 20,000 employees, overcome its current
<br>difficulties. King Juan Carlos also has been a proponent
<br>of the deal, which is seen as a way of strengthening Spain'
<br>s relations with Russia. Leon is seeking either to
<br>persuade Repsol's other Spanish shareholders to hold their
<br>shares or to find Spanish buyers for them. At present, the
<br>main hurdle to the Sacyr-Lukoil deal appears to be price,
<br>especially with the continuing fall in the price of oil.
<br>The Spanish banks who are Sacyr's creditors would finance
<br>Lukoil's purchase, as they are reported to prefer to be
<br>creditors of Lukoil than of Sacyr if acceptable collateral
<br>arrangements can be reached.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Comment: His involvement in the sensitive Lukoil
<br>deal plays up Leon's increasing importance as one of
<br>Zapatero's closest advisers, especially on international
<br>issues (along with Defense Minister Chacon). The
<br>forty-four year-old former deputy foreign minister plays a
<br>more policy-oriented role than the coordinating function
<br>that usually falls to the presidency secretary-general. He
<br>also accompanies Zapatero on all his foreign travel. Leon
<br>was supposed to accompany Zapatero to Afghanistan December
<br>23, but the trip was cancelled because of regional
<br>government financing discussions, in which he is the
<br>government's point man. Leon told the Ambassador he expects
<br>to join Zapatero on a trip to Lebanon early in the New Year.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Comment Continued: Leon does not seek a prominent
<br>public role, and he told the Ambassador that a December 22
<br>article in the El Mundo newspaper playing up his super-charged
<br>National Security Advisor role did not go over well with
<br>with Foreign Minister Moratinos and Second Vice
<br>President and Finance/Treasury Minister Solbes. The article
<br>described Leon as the brain behind the effort to increase
<br>Spain's international influence, particularly with the U.S.,
<br>and it included several statements that could be read as
<br>slights to Moratinos, such as "some say he (Leon) is the real
<br>foreign minister and has more influence than the Vice President."
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Comment Continued: Leon clearly will be one of the
<br>key voices shaping Zapatero's views on the next U.S.
<br>administration, and he appears to have a better
<br>understanding of the U.S. than either Zapatero or other
<br>advisers. Leon visited the U.S. in April to meet with
<br>advisers to then-candidates Obama, Clinton, and McCain. He is
<br>reported to have organized Zapatero's September New York meeting
<br>with U.S. business leaders (working through the AmCham), and he
<br>directed the ultimately successful campaign to get Spain
<br>invited to the November G-20 financial crisis summit. He
<br>said he looked forward to meeting with WHA A/S Shannon during
<br>the latter's visit in early January. We will seek to
<br>maintain our strong relationship with him over the coming months.
<br>End Comment.
