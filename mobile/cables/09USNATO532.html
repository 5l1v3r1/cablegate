<br>SUBJECT: LITHUANIAN MOD DISCUSSES NATO CONTINGENCY PLANNING
<br>FOR THE BALTICS
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Ivo Daalder. Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY: In a November 17 meeting with Ambassador
<br>Daalder, Lithuanian Defense Minister Rasa Jukneviciene
<br>underscored the importance of NATO contingency planning to
<br>Vilnius and asked about the status of U.S. thinking on the
<br>subject. Ambassador Daalder said the issue was still being
<br>studied in Washington but no decision had been made. He
<br>urged that the discussion be conducted quietly and not in
<br>public. END SUMMARY
<br>
<br>Contingency Planning
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Jukneviciene underscored the importance of
<br>contingency planning for Lithuania, adding that it was a
<br>Lithuanian Presidential priority for discussions with
<br>Washington. She said that Lithuania's focus was on
<br>attaining an outcome (a plan or, at a minimum, a timeline)
<br>and not on the process or "going public" about the issue.
<br>She said that Lithuania was aware of the potential to expand
<br>EAGLE GUARDIAN, the plan for the defense of Poland, to
<br>include defense of the Baltics, adding that Vilnius would be
<br>satisfied with that approach.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Jukneviciene said that she had heard that NATO
<br>Secretary General Rasmussen has expressed concerns about the
<br>potential impact of such planning on NATO engagement with
<br>Russia to former U.S. Secretary of State Albright, who now
<br>chairs the Secretary General's Group of Experts advising him
<br>on the revision of NATO's Strategic Concept. She said she
<br>had also heard that the EU's Javier Solana had expressed the
<br>same opinion at a conference in Washington. Jukneviciene
<br>contrasted these alleged remarks with the actions of Russia
<br>during the Russian-Belarussian ZAPAD 2009 military exercise,
<br>arguing that Moscow was clearly not concerned about damaging
<br>relations with NATO or Russia's neighbors. She cited the
<br>tepid response of some Allies to ZAPAD 2009 as an example of
<br>the "Russian influence" on Alliance security issues.
<br>
<br>Daalder Responds
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Daalder responded by noting strong U.S. commitment
<br>to NATO Article 5 commitments, as demonstrated by its
<br>decision on Missile Defense, while noting that Washington was
<br>still studying the issue of contingency planning. He also
<br>urged Lithuania not to engage in a public debate on
<br>contingency planning; something which he said would only
<br>prove harmful to the Lithuanian cause. He stressed that this
<br>issue should be discussed confidentially within NATO.
