<br>SUBJECT: YEMEN ABUZZ WITH TALK OF CT OPERATIONS; TTENTION SLOWLY TURNS TO U.S. ROLE
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Stephen Seche for reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY. Yemenis have talked of little else but the
<br>counterterrorism operations against al-Qaeda in the Arabian
<br>Peninsula since news broke of the pre-dawn raids on December
<br>¶17. Official media and ROYG officials have focused on the
<br>successful aspects of the operation, including an alleged 34
<br>terrorists killed and 51 arrested. Independent and
<br>opposition media as well as the opposition Joint Meeting
<br>Parties and members of the Southern Movement have used the
<br>operations ) specifically the deadly airstrikes in Abyan
<br>governorate ) to criticize what they view as the ROYG's
<br>heavy-handed policies. After a series of stories on U.S.
<br>involvement broke in the U.S. media in the days after the
<br>strikes, local and pan-Arab media have begun to focus on this
<br>aspect of the story. ROYG media reported the conversation
<br>between President Obama and President Saleh and released an
<br>official statement that there was no U.S. military
<br>involvement in the raids. While President Saleh and the ROYG
<br>seem determined to move forward with similar strikes in the
<br>future (septel), still-nascent public support will depend on
<br>the ROYG's ability to effectively manage the evolving
<br>coverage of the events. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>Heavy media coverage along partisan lines
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The ROYG made swift work of announcing the preemptive
<br>dawn strikes against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)
<br>in Sana'a and Abyan governorates on December 17. But ABC TV
<br>news reports of U.S. intelligence and logistical assistance
<br>to the ROYG were picked up on the same day by Yemen's
<br>opposition media, and were quickly followed by charges of
<br>scores of civilian deaths due to the "joint" airstrikes in
<br>Abyan by ROYG and U.S. forces. Opposition demonstrators and
<br>media outlets, as well as members of Parliament, have called
<br>for an investigation of the civilian deaths in Abyan due to
<br>the airstrikes. The story, heavily reported in the
<br>international press, of an extensive role by U.S.
<br>counter-terrorism forces in assisting the ROYG will linger as
<br>long as interest in the civilian deaths continues.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Raids against AQAP at dawn on December 17 in Arhab (a
<br>suburb of Sanaa) and a training camp located in a village in
<br>Abyan's al-Mahfad district were reported immediately by the
<br>Ministry of Defense Web site 26sep.com and picked up by local
<br>and international media by noon on December 17. Reports of
<br>U.S. logistical and intelligence assistance to ROYG
<br>counter-terrorism forces were reported on ABC TV later the
<br>same day. That TV broadcast was swiftly reported on the
<br>opposition Islah party's Web site, al-Sahwa, repeating
<br>assertions of U.S. assistance to the ROYG, and citing unnamed
<br>eyewitnesses claiming that 18 children and 41 men and women
<br>were among the civilians killed by airstrikes. Also on
<br>December 17, al-Jazeera aired footage of civilian casualties
<br>and quoted locals as saying that U.S. aircraft were sighted
<br>on overflight surveillance on the eve of the airstrikes in
<br>Abyan. The official media was slow to respond to rapid
<br>coverage critical of the raids by opposition media and to
<br>organized protests in the region, instead focusing its
<br>initial reporting on AQAP leaders killed or captured in the
<br>raids.
<br>
<br>Official media defends strikes, denies u.s. Involvement
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) By December 18, the regional and international
<br>media, led by the report in the New York Times that the U.S.
<br>had given intelligence, firepower and other assistance to the
<br>ROYG in their raids against AQAP, began to cover the question
<br>of U.S. involvement. The sensationalist and often inaccurate
<br>Almenpar.net, the Houthis' official Web site, and Iran's
<br>PressTV.net both reported 63 people dead in the raids in
<br>Abyan, including 28 children. On December 19, the ROYG went
<br>on the offensive, reporting on the MOD's Web site that
<br>operations against AQAP militants were targeted to foil
<br>suicide bombers planning attacks against Yemeni and foreign
<br>installations, that the raids resulted in killing four
<br>suicide bombers and arresting four others, and that the
<br>attack on the training center in Abyan resulted in the deaths
<br>of 24-30 AQAP members. Al-Jazeera, meanwhile, broadcast a
<br>report on December 19 that the number killed in Abyan was
<br>over 60, according to eyewitnesses, and that most of the
<br>deaths were civilians. The satellite channel also showed
<br>video of artillery shells with visible serial numbers and
<br>claimed that "U.S. warplanes or cruise missiles probably
<br>conducted the strike." On December 21, official media
<br>
<br>
<br>attempted to get the damaging story of civilian deaths off
<br>the front pages by diverting focus to the war in Sa'ada.
<br>
<br>Elites react with reserve, some praise
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Gauging public opinion on the December 17 CT strikes
<br>is difficult since the majority of Yemen's population is
<br>rural and no national polling systems exist. The political
<br>elite as represented by Embassy contacts, however, have
<br>generally reacted with reserve, and some have even offered
<br>praise for "long-overdue" action. In an e-mail to EmbOffs,
<br>xxxxx
<br>congratulated the USG on the successful CT operations, which
<br>he praised as necessary to rid Yemen of terrorist elements.
<br>xxxxx, told PolOff that the strikes were necessary to bring
<br>Abyan back from the edge of extremism. "Al-Qaeda travels
<br>freely throughout Abyan and Shebwa, using their training
<br>camps. They now number in the thousands in these areas," he
<br>said. Criticism among the elite classes has so far been
<br>limited to loss of civilian life and largely avoided any
<br>criticism of the U.S. xxxxx to PolOff on December
<br>20, "We do not support religious, ideological or political
<br>extremism, but to use military violence that kills innocents
<br>on the pretext of pursuing criminals is wrong." xxxxx often critical of ROYG
<br>policies - told PolOff on December 18 that he perceived the
<br>operations as successful, but wished the Arhab operation had
<br>netted the "big fish," AQAP Operational Commander Qassim
<br>al-Rimi, which would have provided a better justification for
<br>any civilian losses.
<br>
<br>Opposition hits back, citing civilian deaths
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Members of the opposition Joint Meeting Parties
<br>(JMP), Parliament and the Southern Movement have all used the
<br>airstrikes in Abyan as a means to attack the ROYG for what
<br>the oppositionists call heavy-handed policies. The strike in
<br>Maajala in Abyan's al-Mahfad district, which locals have
<br>reported killed 49 "civilians" (including 17 women and 23
<br>children), comes on the heels of a critical and widely read
<br>Human Rights Watch report focused on the ROYG's violent
<br>suppression of political demonstrations in the southern
<br>governorates released on December 15. (Note: Deputy Prime
<br>Minister for Defense and Security Affairs Rashad al-Alimi
<br>told the Ambassador that civilians killed in the airstrikes
<br>were most likely poor Bedouin from the area providing
<br>logistical support to the terrorists and AQAP family members.
<br>End Note.) Non-stop al-Jazeera coverage of the aftermath of
<br>attacks in Abyan has provided fuel for the opposition. On
<br>December 20, Parliament, led by opposition Islah party member
<br>from Abyan Ali al-Ashal, called Alimi and the Minister of
<br>Defense to appear before the legislative body to discuss
<br>reports of civilian deaths in Abyan.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) The JMP immediately seized on reports of civilian
<br>deaths, using the December 17 airstrikes as an excuse not to
<br>participate in President Saleh's National Dialogue, set to
<br>begin on December 26. The Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP)
<br>called for the ROYG to compensate victims' families and pay
<br>for treatment of those wounded in the operations. Local
<br>media reported that "thousands" protested in the perpetually
<br>restive southern governorates of Lahj and Abyan, calling for
<br>an investigation into the attacks. Rumors were rampant among
<br>secessionists in southern Yemen that the attack did not
<br>target an AQAP training camp, but rather a civilian
<br>population. xxxxx the airstrikes in Abyan as another occasion to
<br>promote the movement as a better CT partner for the U.S. than
<br>the ROYG. He told PolOff on December 20, "The Saleh regime
<br>is trying to mix up al-Qaeda with the movement. We're
<br>willing to cooperate with you to avoid killing innocent
<br>people and kick out al-Qaeda."
<br>
<br>Royg frustrated, but willing to stay the course
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) The ROYG has weathered the storm of criticism ) most
<br>of it from the usual suspects ) well, and has restated its
<br>commitment to continue similar operations against AQAP in the
<br>near future. Alimi, speaking for President Saleh, told the
<br>Ambassador on December 20 that his government was determined
<br>to keep hitting AQAP in cooperation with the U.S. (septel).
<br>
<br>Political observers in Sana'a have suggested that President
<br>Saleh received a significant morale boost from personal,
<br>congratulatory phone calls from President Obama and Egyptian
<br>President Hosni Mubarak the day of the strikes. A
<br>weary-sounding xxxxx, "The attack is already causing the
<br>government a headache because the JMP is using it as the
<br>reason not to participate in the National Dialogue," which
<br>will include economic as well as political issues. However,
<br>the ROYG ) often eager to use flack from the opposition as
<br>an excuse not to move forward in controversial CT operations
<br>) has indicated that it is willing to weather the most
<br>recent criticism.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) The December 17 operations against AQAP have proven a
<br>success and served as a significant distraction in the local
<br>media from the government's protracted civil war in the north
<br>of the country. In Sana'a at least, many Yemenis seem to
<br>accept the necessity and inevitability of similar CT action
<br>as al-Qaeda's presence in Yemen's lawless tribal governorates
<br>has ballooned in recent months. The ROYG, however, must be
<br>more proactive in countering inaccurate opposition stories
<br>and AQAP propaganda regarding the loss of innocent lives in
<br>the Abyan airstrikes, especially if future operations are
<br>already in the works. While the U.S. has escaped the brunt
<br>of criticism to date, continued leaks from Washington and
<br>international media coverage of American involvement could
<br>stir up anti-American resentment in Yemen and test the ROYG's
<br>professed commitment to going after AQAP. END COMMENT.
