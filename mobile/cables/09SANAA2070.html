<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY. Saudi airstrikes on the Yemeni border
<br>continue but have not managed to clear the area of Houthi
<br>rebels. Yemeni journalists and the Houthis report Saudi
<br>strikes are hitting Yemeni targets, claims that are denied by
<br>the ROYG and SAG. Multiple media sources report the Saudi
<br>Navy is imposing a blockade on ports along northern Yemen's
<br>Red Sea coast. As Yemen's neighbors rush to offer the ROYG
<br>additional weapons and munitions, Iranian officials denounce
<br>the Saudi strikes and are calling for Islamic states to
<br>defend innocent Shi'a from ROYG and SAG attacks. Yemeni
<br>analysts fear that military action by Saudi Arabia is
<br>creating a regional, sectarian war that will lead to direct
<br>Iranian involvement. It is also possible that the Houthis
<br>have sought to internationalize the conflict, either to
<br>attract international support or to ensure that any
<br>negotiated political solution would include international,
<br>not ROYG, mediators. President Saleh appears to have gained
<br>the most from recent developments, as he has finally obtained
<br>direct political, financial, and military support for the war
<br>from powerful neighbors -- who also happen to be close U.S.
<br>allies. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>Saudi strikes and clashes intensify
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Saudi airstrikes on the Yemeni border continue, but
<br>have not managed to clear the area of Houthi rebels. On
<br>November 14, Houthi fighters reportedly killed two Saudi
<br>soldiers and injured five others in the Jebel al-Dukhan area,
<br>which reportedly had come under Saudi control days earlier.
<br>Though the ROYG and SAG deny it, the Houthis claim Saudi
<br>bombardment of Yemeni territory continued November 12-15,
<br>including in Malahit, Shada, Hasamah, and Haydan districts.
<br>Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam told AFP on November 13
<br>that Saudi bombing reached up to 60 kilometers inside Yemeni
<br>territory.xxxxx told
<br>PolOff xxxxx that the KSA is "hitting targets in
<br>Yemen." Both xxxxx and xxxxx,
<br>pointed out that Saudi officials have announced their
<br>government's intention of establishing a "buffer zone" by
<br>pushing the Houthis dozens of kilometers away from the
<br>border. To achieve this goal, they argue, SAG would have to
<br>bomb targets inside Yemen. According to Yemeni press, Saudi
<br>newspaper al-Riyad reported that Houthi spokesman Abdulsalam
<br>was killed in a November 15 Saudi airstrike on the Houthis'
<br>media center in Razeh district )- a district that is inside
<br>Yemeni territory.
<br>
<br>Saudi ships patrolling off yemeni coast
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Meanwhile, multiple media reported that Saudi
<br>Arabia imposed a blockade on ports along northern Yemen's Red
<br>Sea coast to prevent arms smuggling to the Houthis.
<br>(Comment: These accounts of a blockade appear exaggerated, as
<br>analysts question whether the Saudi Navy could physically
<br>enforce one. End Comment.) However, the DATT reports the
<br>Yemeni Coast Guard reached an agreement with the Saudi Navy
<br>to blockade Midi Port. The two nations' maritime forces are
<br>communicating about their anti-smuggling efforts, but it is
<br>not clear to what extent, nor if their efforts are being
<br>coordinated. (Comment: The maritime forces' activities are
<br>presumably a reaction to the October 25 seizure of an
<br>Iranian-crewed ship off the coast of Yemen's Midi Port that
<br>was allegedly smuggling arms to the Houthis. The ROYG has
<br>yet to produce evidence that Iranians were smuggling arms to
<br>the Houthis, as the ship was apparently empty when it was
<br>seized. However, echoing a claim Yemen Ambassador al-Hajjri
<br>made recently, Foreign Minister Qirbi told PolChief on
<br>November 15 the fact that the ship was empty indicated the
<br>arms had already been delivered. End Comment.)
<br>
<br>Neighbors rush to aid the royg
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Across the region, governments are rushing to aid
<br>the ROYG in its battle against the Houthis. The Saudis have
<br>agreed to provide the ROYG with APCs, weapons, and ammunition
<br>and to assist in the purchase of helicopters for the Yemeni
<br>Air Force. The SAG is also offering to purchase weapons and
<br>ammunition from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, while the
<br>UAE has agreed to broker a similar deal with Bulgaria
<br>
<br>Sanaa 00002070 002 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>(reftel). Official media reported that the Kuwaiti
<br>Ambassador to Yemen met with Minister of Interior Rashad
<br>al-Masri on November 15 to discuss security cooperation,
<br>presumably related to the war in Sa'ada.
<br>
<br>Iranian indignation
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) On November 15, the Iranian parliament condemned
<br>Saudi interference in the conflict and denounced the "killing
<br>(of) Yemeni people by Saudi Arabian fighter jets." In its
<br>statement, the Majlis urged "all sympathetic officials in the
<br>Islamic world ... to utilize all their potential to stop this
<br>tragedy and put an end to the killings," according to Tehran
<br>Mehr News Agency. The Yemen Post reported on November 15
<br>that the Speaker of Iran's Shura Council, Ali Larijani,
<br>accused the US and Saudi Arabia of targeting Shi'ite rebels
<br>in Yemen. In a statement posted on the Council's website, he
<br>said the USG was an accomplice in the attacks against the
<br>Houthis. Meanwhile, ROYG officials repeated their
<br>accusations that Iran is funding the Houthis. In a November
<br>15 al-Jazeera interview, General Yahya Saleh, the Qident's
<br>nephew anQmmander of the Central Security Forces
<br>Counter-Terrorism Unit, said there is "no doubt" Iran is
<br>supporting the Houthis )- "the Houthis cannot fund and fight
<br>this war with pomegranates and grapes or drugs," he said.
<br>
<br>Houthis: "u.s. Plan to silence us"
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The Houthis are also accusing the USG of
<br>involvement in efforts to subdue them. On November 15,
<br>Hizballah's al-Manar TV aired a telephone intervQwith
<br>Houthi spokesman Abdulsalam in which he said the Saudis had
<br>been compelled to strike the Houthis after the ROYG failed to
<br>implement the "U.S. plan" to silence and subjugate the
<br>Houthis. He said the allegations that the Houthis
<br>infiltrated Saudi Arabia are nothing more than a pretext to
<br>justify a "U.S.-Yemeni security plan" to prolong the war.
<br>(Comment: This may refer to false reports in the official
<br>Yemeni media that the USG and ROYG signed a military
<br>agreement at the November 10-12 joint staff talks. While
<br>Post issued a statement clarifying that no such agreement was
<br>signed, the initial report, implying that the agreement will
<br>aid Yemen's battle against the Houthis, was picked up by
<br>Iran's Press TV and even Voice of America. End Comment.)
<br>
<br>Implications of regionalization,
<br>fears of saudi over-reaction
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Yemeni analysts believe Saudi involvement is creating
<br>a regional sectarian war that will serve as an invitation to
<br>Iranian involvement.xxxxx, told the Ambassador on November 15 that
<br>Sa'ada residents are increasingly seeing the conflict as a
<br>religious one and believe that the Houthis achieve
<br>battlefield victories because God is on their side. He added
<br>that Saudi Arabia's involvement is only encouraging the
<br>Houthis and their supporters to see the conflict in sectarian
<br>terms. He claimed the situation in Sa'ada is as bad as it is
<br>because the religious factor helps the Houthis garner support
<br>from the local population; by sharpening that aspect of the
<br>conflict, Saudi involvement could mobilize additional support
<br>for the Houthis, he concluded. Moreover, xxxxx
<br>believes the Houthis might begin supporting Zaydis on the
<br>Saudi side of the border, home to an estimated 2,000 Zaydi
<br>Saudis. While they may not share the same grievances as
<br>Zaydis in northern Yemen, if the conflict becomes
<br>increasingly sectarian, Saudi Zaydis may find a new champion
<br>in the Houthis, and the Houthis may find a new base of
<br>support among the Saudi population. Furthermore, Qadhi told
<br>PolOff on November 15 there is growing sentiment among
<br>Iranians that they "should not leave Yemen's Shi'a alone to
<br>face aggression from the Saudi and Yemeni governments."
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxx fears that the guerrilla nature of the
<br>war, in which small groups of Houthi fighters familiar with
<br>the rugged terrain launch sneak attacks at a mighty foe,
<br>could provoke the Saudis into over-reacting and causing
<br>serious harm to civilians caught in the crossfire. Saudi
<br>Arabia is using state-of-the-art weaponry against the
<br>Houthis, but in more than a week of heavy bombings apparently
<br>have not been able to clear them from the area. xxxxx says
<br>if the "little brat in the neighborhood" can continue to
<br>
<br>Sanaa 00002070 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>capture and kill Saudi soldiers, the KSA may not react
<br>rationally and may begin targeting villages, markets, and
<br>other civilian gathering places in order to root out the
<br>insurgents.
<br>
<br>Houthi gambit?
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) What prompted the SAG's involvement in the war is a
<br>subject of considerable speculation in Yemen. While
<br>President Saleh has long been encouraging Saudi Arabia to
<br>join the fight, most analysts believe the Houthis had reason
<br>to provoke their involvement as well. xxxxx thinks the
<br>Houthis attacked the Saudi border guards in order to
<br>internationalize the conflict. "Maybe they drew in Saudi
<br>Arabia because they wanted to negotiate with the master
<br>rather than the servant," he told PolOff on November 15.
<br>Havez al-Bukari, President of Yemen Polling Center, agrees
<br>that the Houthis wanted to draw Saudi Arabia into the
<br>conflict in order to get more attention from the
<br>international community. According to Bukari, by
<br>internationalizing the conflict, the Houthis' demands for
<br>international mediation )- which the ROYG has refused,
<br>insisting that any negotiations will be handled domestically
<br>-) become much stronger. He believes the Houthis want a
<br>foreign government or international body to broker dialogue
<br>between the ROYG and the Houthis, since previous peace talks
<br>were predominantly internal affairs. They want a "partner"
<br>in the talks, not a "sponsor" of them, as he characterized
<br>Qatar's role in mediating the 2008 Doha peace accord.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) The ROYG and the Houthis both stand to gain from
<br>expanding the conflict beyond Yemen's borders: the ROYG
<br>benefits from the military and financial might of its
<br>powerful northern neighbor, while the Houthis are better
<br>positioned to receive overt Iranian backing or to spur some
<br>sort of international political settlement. Yet the benefit
<br>to Saudi Arabia seems less clear. While the need to protect
<br>its border is obvious, the airstrikes could backfire in a
<br>number of ways. First, the SAG risks becoming embroiled in
<br>an intractable guerrilla war. Second, Saudi involvement
<br>fuels the ROYG's perception that the real, immediate threat
<br>to the Arabian Peninsula is the Houthis, not al-Qaeda.
<br>Third, as noted reftel, by transferring millions of dollars
<br>worth of weapons to the ROYG, there is a strong chance the
<br>very same weapons will leak into the gray market and end up
<br>being used against Saudi Arabia by terrorists. Fourth, it
<br>invites Iranian involvement )- which creates a
<br>self-fulfilling prophecy, since the fear that Iran was at
<br>Saudi's doorstep is partly what motivated the strikes in the
<br>first place.
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) COMMENT CONTINUED. In the short-term at least,
<br>it seems like President Saleh has gained the most from the
<br>Saudis' entry into the conflict. His glee when the Saudis
<br>launched their airstrikes indicates he finally received what
<br>he has been pushing for )- political, financial, and direct
<br>military support for the war from Yemen's powerful neighbor
<br>and principal benefactor. He will use this support to battle
<br>the Houthis as well as to send a signal of the regime's
<br>staying power to other domestic actors who may seek to
<br>undermine it. Saleh will not rest with Saudi support,
<br>however, and will doubtlessly rely on the SAG to advocate
<br>some measure of USG involvement, given our strong ties to
<br>Riyadh. END COMMENT.
