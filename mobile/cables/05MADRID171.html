<br>
<br>Classified By: CHARGE D'AFFAIRS BOB MANZANARES; REASON 1.4 (B) AND (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. Summary. The Zapatero Government has undertaken a series
<br>of gestures intended to signal their desire for improved ties
<br>with the USG. Spain will contribute $20 million to the UNDP
<br>to support the Iraq elections, met a USG request to press
<br>Arab governments to encourage Sunni participation in the Iraq
<br>elections, and used a speech by King Juan Carlos to
<br>underscore the importance to Spain of good bilateral ties
<br>with the U.S. A senior MFA official told Charge Spain "wants
<br>back in" with the USG. We have acknowledged the positive
<br>gestures while urging Spain to do more, for example by
<br>leading a PRT in Afghanistan. We have also asked GOS and
<br>Socialist leaders to rein in unhelpful comments about
<br>Coalition operations in Iraq.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) After months of encouraging such positive steps by the
<br>GOS, we appear to be closer to a turning point with the
<br>Zapatero Government. MFA and Moncloa representatives have
<br>gone to great lengths to ensure that we are taking note of
<br>their positive actions on issues such as Iraq. While not
<br>supportive of the USG mission, GOS officials are clearly
<br>aware that it is more productive to contribute to Iraq's
<br>reconstruction than to reiterate their opposition to the war
<br>itself. They are clearly extending their hand to us and we
<br>believe it is important that we both acknowledge the positive
<br>Spanish gestures and encourage further positive measures on
<br>the part of the GOS, for example by leading a PRT in
<br>Afghanistan and/or providing training for Iraqi security
<br>personnel in Spain. At the very least, we should take
<br>advantage of their current interest in repairing ties with us
<br>to accomplish key USG objectives in Afghanistan. End Summary.
<br>
<br>//POSITIVE GESTURES ON IRAQ//
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Spain will provide $20 million to support the Iraq
<br>elections, according to National Security Adviser Carles
<br>Casajuana. Poloff had provided REF A points to Deputy
<br>Director General for the Near East Alberto Moreno on 1/3 and
<br>urged Spain to support the International Mission for Iraq
<br>Elections (IMIE). Moreno said he would study the paper and
<br>respond soon. We subsequently learned that at the time the
<br>REF A points were delivered, the GOS was nearing the end of a
<br>long internal debate on whether to provide assistance for the
<br>Iraq elections, though not through the IMIE. We were
<br>informed of the positive decision by MFA Deputy Director
<br>General for Foreign Policy Felix Costales, who provided
<br>poloff a 1/10 clipping from the Spanish news agency EFE
<br>describing the GOS assistance to the Iraq elections through
<br>the UNDP and said he hoped the USG would take positive note
<br>of the GOS contribution (SEE REF B). The comments were
<br>attributed to an unnamed GOS official and drew no local news
<br>coverage, a fact that did not disappoint Casajuana given the
<br>political sensitivity of any GOS involvement in Iraq.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Costales noted that, at the USG's request, Spain had
<br>also engaged Arab countries to urge them to press Iraqi
<br>Sunnis to participate in the elections. Most importantly, he
<br>said, Spain had demarched Syrian authorities, requesting that
<br>they explain to Iraqi Sunni leaders the potential long term
<br>cost to them of refusing to participate in a process that
<br>most of the international community will endorse.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Charge contacted Casajuana on 1/11 to congratulate the
<br>GOS on the contribution. Casajuana said the GOS supported
<br>the January 30 elections because, difficult as the process
<br>may be, the increased legitimacy of the new Iraqi authorities
<br>would likely lead to improved security conditions for the
<br>Iraqi people. The sensitivity of the matter for the GOS was
<br>underscored when the local daily "El Mundo" cited an MFA
<br>source as denying a report that the Spanish contribution had
<br>been made in order to help repair relations with the USG.
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) According to Costales, the GOS funds came from Spain's
<br>$300 million pledge made during the Iraq Donors Conference
<br>and were provide to UNDP in support of the electoral process.
<br>In 2004-2005, Spain disbursed $160 million of these funds.
<br>Costales said the GOS had not yet determined how best to
<br>channel the remaining $140 million Spanish aid, but wanted to
<br>demonstrate its commitment to help rebuild Iraq. (NOTE: A
<br>1/12 news report indicated the remaining Spanish aid to Iraq
<br>will primarily be in the form of soft loans. END NOTE).
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Poloff spoke with Deputy Director General for the Near
<br>East Alberto Moreno on 1/12 to learn more about the debate
<br>and the GOS contribution. Moreno said Spanish officials were
<br>torn between "funding an election that would take place under
<br>difficult conditions" or directing such aid where it would
<br>"do more to improve humanitarian conditions." Moreno said
<br>that he and others in the Near East Directorate believed that
<br>there was no option other than to proceed with elections as
<br>soon as possible. "The only hope is that the next Iraqi
<br>government will enjoy greater legitimacy than the current
<br>authorities and will therefore be able to improve security
<br>conditions." Asked about the GOS approach to Arab countries
<br>to encourage Sunni participation, Moreno said that Spain was
<br>happy to help when asked, but that he did not believe the GOS
<br>had managed to move those governments to action. Moreno said
<br>he hoped both gestures would help mend bilateral relations.
<br>Poloff assured him that the USG was appreciative of these
<br>steps by Spain.
<br>
<br>//THE KING LAUDS IMPORTANCE OF U.S.-SPAIN TIES//
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) During a 1/13 Royal reception for the Madrid
<br>diplomatic corps, King Juan Carlos declared that bilateral
<br>relations with the U.S. represented a "fundamental point of
<br>reference" for Spanish foreign policy. He added that one of
<br>Spain's primary objectives was to "develop improved bilateral
<br>ties with the U.S. at every level."
<br>
<br>//MFA: "WE WANT BACK IN" WITH THE USG//
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) MFA Director General for Foreign Policy (P equivalent)
<br>Rafael Dezcallar approached Charge following the King's
<br>speech to inform him that the MFA had drafted that portion of
<br>the King's speech. Dezcallar also pointed to Spain's $20
<br>million contribution to the Iraq elections as another gesture
<br>of goodwill and willingness to cooperate with the USG on an
<br>issue important to us. "We wanted to send clear signals that
<br>we want back in" with the USG. (NOTE: Positive coverage of
<br>the King's remarks were tempered by coverage in the
<br>Socialist-aligned "El Pais" daily of Socialist Secretary for
<br>International Relations Trinidad Jimenez' attack on the
<br>opposition Popular Party for having drawn Spain into an
<br>"illegal war" in Iraq. END NOTE.)
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Charge responded that we had noticed the positive
<br>tone and actions on the part of the GOS and would report
<br>these to Washington. However, Charge noted what we were most
<br>interested in the moment was Spanish leadership of a PRT in
<br>Afghanistan. Dezcallar said Spain wanted to lead a PRT, but
<br>qualified this position when pressed, indicating Spain would
<br>lead a PRT "if it was in the right location." Dezcallar said
<br>that the GOS had sent an MOD representative to London to
<br>discuss precisely where Spain would like to deploy next.
<br>(NOTE: We confirmed through the UK Embassy that Spain had
<br>asked to take over the UK PRT in Mazar-i-Sharif. The UK
<br>Ambassador told Charge that the UK had not responded
<br>immediately to the request and was not inclined to transfer
<br>that mission to Spain. END NOTE.)
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) After months of urging the GOS to cease gratuitous
<br>criticism of the Coalition effort in Iraq, we appear to be
<br>closer to a turning point with the Zapatero Government,
<br>though evidently not with all members of the Socialist Party.
<br>MFA and Moncloa representatives have gone to great lengths
<br>to ensure that we are taking note of their positive actions
<br>on issues such as Iraq. While not supportive of the USG
<br>mission, GOS officials are clearly aware that it is more
<br>productive to contribute to Iraq's reconstruction than to
<br>reiterate their opposition to the war itself. They are
<br>clearly extending their hand to us and we believe it is
<br>important that we both acknowledge the positive Spanish
<br>gestures and encourage further positive measures on the part
<br>of the GOS, for example by leading a PRT in Afghanistan
<br>and/or providing training for Iraqi security personnel in
<br>Spain. At the very least, we should take advantage of their
<br>current interest in repairing ties with us to accomplish key
<br>USG objectives in Afghanistan.
