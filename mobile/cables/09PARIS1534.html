<br>SUBJECT: "FRANCAFRIQUE" -- MFA DISPUTES REPORTS ON A RETURN 
<br>TO BUSINESS AS USUAL 
<br>
<br>REF: A. 08 PARIS 1501 
<br>¶B. 08 PARIS 1568 
<br>¶C. 08 PARIS 1698 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Andrew Young, Political Counselor, reason 1.4 (b and d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: MFA's AF Assistant Secretary-equivalent 
<br>Stephan Gompertz denied that France's approach to Africa is 
<br>backsliding into the patterns of previous administrations' 
<br>"francafrique." He insisted that France is not interfering 
<br>in African countries' internal politics. He said that in 
<br>the recent examples of Gabon, Niger, and Guinea, France has 
<br>supported democratic change. Gompertz admits the "insider" 
<br>influence of Robert Bourgi, and laments that France is still 
<br>not focused on a more strategic approach to Africa. At the 
<br>same time, he claims, (somewhat questionably), that it is the 
<br>MFA's leadership that is driving the GOF's relations in 
<br>Africa. In our view, France remains committed to its stated 
<br>policy of developing transparent partnerships with Africans 
<br>but, when pressed by circumstances, may resort to the more 
<br>opaque ways associated with "francafrique" when doing so is 
<br>in France's national interest. End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) During a November 17 meeting with Pol Minister 
<br>Counselor, the MFA's AF Assistant Secretary-equivalent 
<br>Stephan Gompertz disputed the assertions made in a November 
<br>13 New York Times article that France "still pulls the 
<br>strings" in Francophone Africa ("Ill Will Grows in a Former 
<br>Colonial Regional as France Consorts With the Powerful," by 
<br>Adam Nossiter), as well as similar commentary offered in 
<br>recent weeks by the French media. Gompertz strongly denied 
<br>that France interferes in a country's internal politics, and 
<br>asserted that Sarkozy remains serious about moving away from 
<br>the paternalistic and secret dealings of France's 
<br>"francafrique" era. (Note: see Reftels for detailed 
<br>analysis of "France's Changing Africa Policy." End note.) 
<br>
<br>RECENT CRITICISMS ARE "UNFAIR" 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>¶3. (C) Responding to specific cases cited in the Nossiter 
<br>article, Gompertz said the selective information presented 
<br>was "unfair." He first seized on the example of Gabon's 
<br>recent presidential elections, and insisted that France would 
<br>have supported a different electoral outcome than Ali Bongo 
<br>if the opposition had organized themselves to achieve 
<br>victory. Having received almost 60 percent of the vote, it 
<br>was the splintered and uncoordinated opposition that allowed 
<br>Bongo to win, not France. Gompertz added that in his 
<br>personal view Bongo was a more credible candidate than the 
<br>two main opposition leaders, and asserted that Bongo has done 
<br>"a pretty good job, so far," especially on addressing Gabon's 
<br>endemic corruption. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) For Niger, Gompertz said that "we are troubled." (The 
<br>day before, with AF DAS Fitzgerald, Gompertz said that France 
<br>was "embarrassed" by the situation in Niger.) Gompertz 
<br>claimed, however, that France led the international charge 
<br>trying to stop President Tandja from changing the 
<br>constitution and holding elections for a third term. He was 
<br>bothered that the NY Times piece showed an old photo of 
<br>Sarkozy and Tandja together, without explaining that Sarkozy 
<br>later publicly advised Tandja to respect Niger's constitution 
<br>and not stand for a third term. Gompertz added that after 
<br>Tandja succeeded in his constitutional referendum, State 
<br>Secretary Joyandet and later Foreign Minister Kouchner 
<br>publicly and privately encouraged Tandja to postpone his 
<br>election in order to work out a more democratic solution. 
<br>Gompertz acknowledged that France had important interests in 
<br>Niger, in particular its uranium concessions, and that France 
<br>was very concerned about AQIM threats in the country. Still, 
<br>it is unfair to describe France's efforts in Niger were not 
<br>sincere, Gompertz said. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The NY Times article also commented on the situation 
<br>in Guinea, but Gompertz stressed that FM Kouchner was the 
<br>most vocal and active critic of the regime after the 
<br>September 28 violence. According to Gompertz, Kouchner 
<br>pushed for the establishment of the International Contact 
<br>Group, persuaded the EU to take a firm stand and pursue 
<br>sanctions against Guinea's ruling junta, and it was Kouchner 
<br>who convinced Senegalese President Wade to evacuate injured 
<br>opposition leader Cellou Diallo to Dakar. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Gompertz noted that Senior French officials, both at 
<br>the MFA (and, in our experience, at the Elysee) routinely 
<br>meet with African opposition leaders, both in Paris and 
<br>overseas, adding that Joyandet was scheduled to meet with 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001534 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Cellou Diallo that afternoon. 
<br>
<br>FRANCE'S AFRICA POLICY DOES HAVE PROBLEMS 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>¶7. (C) Gompertz admitted that France's Africa policy does 
<br>have problems, most notably, that France continues to focus 
<br>most of its efforts on its former colonies, even though they 
<br>are not necessarily the most strategically important. 
<br>Gompertz hopes to push for a stronger engagement with 
<br>Anglophone and Lusaphone Africa. (Note: GOF officials 
<br>frequently cite Nigeria, Angola, and South Africa as three of 
<br>France's key emerging partners in Africa. Gompertz was 
<br>departing the same afternoon for Morocco and South Africa. 
<br>End note.) Similarly, too much of France's political and 
<br>cooperation resources in Africa are designed to reinforce its 
<br>partnerships within the international "Francophonie" 
<br>organization. Gompertz cited the example of Burundi, where 
<br>English is replacing French as the most popular foreign 
<br>language, but he said this is understandable given Burundi's 
<br>important trade links in the East African Community. At the 
<br>same time, he related that while he was Ambassador to 
<br>Ethiopia, there was a strong demand for French language 
<br>teachers, but France was not responsive in helping meet this 
<br>need. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Targeting more closely the topic of "francafrique," 
<br>Gompertz said he "regretted" that lawyer and presidential 
<br>advisor Robert Bourgi (touted by the French press as the new 
<br>standard bearer of the old "francafrique") was Sarkozy's 
<br>friend, but "that's a fact of life." While admitting that 
<br>Bourgi operates in the shadows and has influence on France's 
<br>approach to Africa, Gompertz stated forcefully that policy 
<br>for sub-Saharan Africa is led by "Kouchner, Joyandet, and 
<br>me." 
<br>
<br>COMMENT AND ANALYSIS 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>¶9. (C) The sincere and mild-mannered Gompertz almost worked 
<br>up a dander in defending France's approach to Africa as well 
<br>as the importance of the MFA's leadership. However, though 
<br>not entirely at odds with Gompertz's assertions, the GOF's 
<br>Africa policy hands increasingly suggest France's need to 
<br>contrast the importance of stability in a volatile region 
<br>with nobler democratic ideals, as has been shown in Niger, 
<br>Mauritania, Madagascar, and, perhaps, now in Guinea. 
<br>Unfortunately, there was not time during this meeting to ask 
<br>about other notorious "francafrique" hotspots, such as the 
<br>Republic of Congo, Togo, Cameron, and Equatorial Guinea. 
<br>Also, by downplaying the role of Bourgi, and by not 
<br>commenting on the important role of the Presidency's 
<br>Secretary General Claude Gueant (also a friend of Bourgi) in 
<br>shaping France's relations with African leaders, Gompertz, 
<br>perhaps unwittingly, revealed his own concerns about a 
<br>philosophical division between the Elysee and the MFA on 
<br>Africa policy. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Clearly, there is much jostling between the MFA and 
<br>Presidency for Africa policy leadership. Remi Marechaux, one 
<br>of the staff-level Africa advisors at the Elysee, scoffs 
<br>whenever the issue of a resurgent "francafrique" is raised. 
<br>He pointedly notes that during "francafrique's" heyday under 
<br>the legendary Jacques Foccart, the Africa cell at the 
<br>Presidency numbered about 80, including its own intelligence 
<br>unit. Marechaux contrasts that with today's Africa cell at 
<br>the Presidency, consisting of himself, Romain Serman (soon to 
<br>be replaced by Clement Leclerc), and their recently-arrived 
<br>boss (and Deputy Diplomatic Advisor) Andre Parant, who 
<br>replaced Bruno Joubert. Marechaux bristles at the notion 
<br>that the three of them are pulling strings the way their 80 
<br>predecessors did. Marechaux says that the role of the 
<br>Elysee's Africa cell is to channel the policy ideas of 
<br>President Sarkozy (admittedly influenced by Bourgi, Gueant, 
<br>special advisor Henri Guaino, and Sarkozy's other close 
<br>associates) and that the MFA's role is to do what 
<br>bureaucracies traditionally do -- either implement those 
<br>ideas or explain, with bureaucratic thoroughness, why those 
<br>ideas are not feasible. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Our own view is that there is a wide range of policy 
<br>approaches available to the French, a spectrum running from 
<br>the more ideal approaches Sarkozy expressed in his early days 
<br>in office (reftels) to the more opaque but possibly more 
<br>expedient approaches conforming to the old "francafrique" 
<br>model. Circumstances and the unpredictable, sometimes 
<br>violent nature of events in Africa may at times tempt or even 
<br>force the French to act less ideally than they may want -- a 
<br>form of behavior familiar to every other government in the 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001534 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>world -- when decisions are based on a need to further the 
<br>national interest in the most effective way possible, even 
<br>when the most effective way may not be the prettiest way. We 
<br>find the GOF's professional cadre of Africa hands accessible, 
<br>open, and wanting to find common ground with the U.S. in many 
<br>situations. Gompertz appeared as a man with a burden lifted 
<br>when he was reminded of The New York Times' November 17 
<br>article asserting large-scale corruption by Equatorial 
<br>Guinean Minister (and the President's son), Teodoro Nguema 
<br>Obiang, reportedly a frequent visitor to and investor in the 
<br>U.S. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) Conakry and Tripoli minimize considered.
