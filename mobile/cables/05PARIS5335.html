<br>SUBJECT: ALLAN HUBBARD'S CALL ON INTERIOR MINISTER SARKOZY
<br>
<br>REF: PARIS 5232
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Craig R. Stapleton for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d
<br>).
<br>
<br>¶1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Ambassador Stapleton and National Economic
<br>Council Director Allan Hubbard met with Interior Minister
<br>Nicolas Sarkozy on August 1.  Sarkozy expressed his
<br>admiration for President Bush and said he looked forward to
<br>the opportunity to tackle France's economic and social
<br>problems with the same directness for which the President is
<br>justly famous.  Sarkozy confirmed that he would be running
<br>for President of France in 2007.  He said his own struggle to
<br>rise to high office, as the son of immigrants challenging
<br>entrenched elites, in part explained his deep admiration for
<br>America's values.  He said he would stress opportunity and
<br>making a "deep break with the past" -- by proposing
<br>significant change to France's social model -- in his 2007
<br>campaign.  On economic issues, Sarkozy reprised many of his
<br>now familiar policy themes: France's economic model holds
<br>back growth; people need to work more and be rewarded for
<br>doing so; and people need to be told the truth about the
<br>economic situation.  He was upbeat
<br>about France's future if the country seized the opportunity
<br>that reforms could bring.  He also tossed out a few of the
<br>"policy zingers" for which he is well known, notably "The
<br>European Central Bank confuses a strong currency with a
<br>strong economy," and "France needs to do what Reagan did in
<br>the U.S., Thatcher in Britain, and Gonzales in Spain."  End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2.  (U) Ambassador Stapleton and Allan Hubbard, Director of
<br>the National Economic Council, met with France's Minister of
<br>Interior, Nicolas Sarkozy on 1 August.  Sarkozy is also the
<br>president of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party, a
<br>coalition of center-right parties founded by President Chirac
<br>in 2002.  The meeting took place in Sarkozy's office at the
<br>Ministry of the Interior and was also attended by Sarkozy
<br>Chief of Staff Claude Gueant and Interior Ministry Staffer
<br>Cederic Goubet.  Embassy Econ Counselor, Poloff and Economic
<br>Analyst (as interpreter) accompanied Mr. Hubbard and
<br>Ambassador Stapleton.
<br>
<br>ADMIRATION FOR PRESIDENT BUSH
<br>-----------------------------
<br>¶3.  (C) Sarkozy expressed his admiration for President Bush.
<br>Sarkozy said that, like the President, he too was committed
<br>to keeping his word and to dealing honestly with the real
<br>problems of the country, "unlike the rest of those
<br>politicians."  Throughout the hour-long meeting, Sarkozy
<br>returned again and again to the importance of leveling with
<br>people.  He illustrated his point by saying the "French
<br>people have to be told the truth -- and they want to hear
<br>it."  He added that most politicians, and specifically
<br>President Chirac, just keep stringing the people along with
<br>their "constant tergiversating."  Economic Council Director
<br>Hubbard's presentation of the President's direct and
<br>principled tackling of America's major domestic challenges
<br>(taxes, social security, education), drew the high compliment
<br>from Sarkozy that he too would like to tackle the same
<br>problems, in the same way, for France.
<br>
<br>DISAGREEING WITH VERSUS UNDERCUTTING THE U.S.
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>¶4.  (C) Sarkozy lamented the troubled state of U.S.-France
<br>relations during recent years.  He drew a sharp distinction
<br>between disagreeing with friends and undercutting them.  He
<br>said, "we should always be able to disagree."  Calling it
<br>something he "would never do", he cited President Chirac's,
<br>and then-Foreign Minister de Villepin's, use of France's
<br>Security Council veto against the U.S. in February 2002 as an
<br>unjustifiable and excessive reaction to a difference of
<br>views.  He added that he would have advised the U.S. not to
<br>undertake the invasion and occupation of Iraq -- but that
<br>that didn't prevent him from "feeling it personally when
<br>American soldiers die in combat."  He proudly pointed out
<br>how, at the height of anti-American feeling and anti-U.S.
<br>demonstrations (contemporaneous to Sarkozy's first stint as
<br>Minister of the Interior (2002 - 2004)), he took it as a
<br>personal responsibility to see to it that "no U.S. Embassy or
<br>Consulate was so much as touched" by demonstrators.
<br>
<br>IDENTIFYING WITH AMERICA'S VALUES
<br>---------------------------------
<br>¶5.  (C) "They call me 'Sarkozy the American,'" he said, "they
<br>consider it an insult, but I take it as a compliment."
<br>Sarkozy stressed how much he "recognized himself" in
<br>America's values.  He recalled how as a boy, he told his
<br>father that he wanted to grow up to be president.  He said
<br>his Hungarian-born father retorted, "In that case, go to
<br>America -- because with a name like Sarkozy, you'll never
<br>make it here."  Proving that wrong, Sarkozy said, was a
<br>touchstone for his efforts both to succeed and to transform
<br>France into a place where "outsiders" like him could also
<br>enjoy opportunity untrammeled by prejudice.  Comment:  Very
<br>much unlike nearly all other French political figures,
<br>Sarkozy is viscerally pro-American.  For most of his peers
<br>the U.S. is a sometimes reviled or admired, but decidedly
<br>foreign, other.  Sarkozy identifies with America; he sees his
<br>own rise in the world as reflecting an American-like saga.
<br>End Comment.
<br>
<br>FIGHTING FRANCE'S ELITE
<br>-----------------------
<br>¶6.  (C) Sarkozy pointed to his own political career as an
<br>example of both his success and the difficulty of achieving
<br>it.  "I'm not a member of the elite...I'm someone who wants
<br>to speak for the France that gets up every morning and
<br>works," he said, as he recalled his own rise from "knowing
<br>nobody and beginning as a simple party supporter, and
<br>climbing every step in the ladder" to his current bid for the
<br>presidency.  With some vehemence, Sarkozy insisted on his
<br>having had to "challenge those stronger than me" every step
<br>of way.
<br>
<br>CONFIRMING HE WILL RUN
<br>----------------------
<br>¶7.  (C) Sarkozy confirmed his intention to run for president
<br>to Ambassador Stapleton and NEC Director Hubbard, saying, "I
<br>am going to be a candidate in 2007".  Outlining his campaign
<br>strategy, Sarkozy said, "we are going to propose change to
<br>the French people."  "I'm convinced that it can work...people
<br>want to believe they can succeed."  Sarkozy then touched on
<br>many of his specific proposals for providing more opportunity
<br>for the able and more support for the disadvantaged -- tax
<br>cuts, labor law reform, affirmative action, immigration
<br>reform, and monetary policy that "recognizes that the
<br>currency is an instrument for supporting a strong economy."
<br>
<br>RECALLING REAGAN, THATCHER AND GONZALES
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>¶8.  (C) On economic affairs, Sarkozy repeated his
<br>often-stated assertion that the French economic model is
<br>"bad."  France needs to do what Spain, the UK and other
<br>successful countries have done over the past twenty years;
<br>take the best of what they have done and adopt those policies
<br>in France.  In response to Mr. Hubbard's question on what
<br>Sarkozy's economic vision for France was, Sarkozy said that
<br>the French people have to understand that they need to work
<br>more and that the Government must make it more profitable for
<br>people who do so.  He said that France needed to a go through
<br>a period similar to the U.S. under Reagan, the UK under
<br>Thatcher, and Spain under Gonzalez.  "France is not an old
<br>country," he said, "but right now it's acting like one."
<br>
<br>INCENTIVES FOR TAKING INITIATIVE
<br>--------------------------------
<br>¶9.  (C) Sarkozy explained his theory that unemployment
<br>benefits should be higher than they currently are for people
<br>immediately after they are laid off.  However they should
<br>quickly phase out to provide an incentive for people to look
<br>for work.  Unemployed people should be required to look for
<br>work; now they are not required to.  Echoing comments made by
<br>Finance Minister Breton, Sarkozy said, "people are ready for
<br>the politics of truth."  He added that his directly expressed
<br>assessments of France's economic problems and his insistent
<br>advocacy of work, innovation and entrepreneurship in fact
<br>contribute to his popularity.  "Some people told me never to
<br>say such things, people will hate you; clearly they don't
<br>hate me," he observed.
<br>
<br>OVER-VALUED EURO AND NO ALAN GREENSPAN
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>10  (C) On the deficit, Sarkozy said that for 25 years France
<br>has been living beyond its means.  Now it is paying the price
<br>for that.  He said that the U.S. had two advantages that
<br>France did not have: "Greenspan and the dollar."  He said
<br>that France was suffering from no longer having control of
<br>its own currency and observed that European Central Bank
<br>(ECB) president Trichet was pursuing exactly the wrong
<br>policies; "he confuses a strong currency with a strong
<br>economy."  Europe needed a pro-growth ECB, not one focused on
<br>fighting inflation only.  The U.S., he observed, "has often
<br>had its strongest economy when the dollar was at its
<br>weakest."  Turning to Chairman Greenspan, Sarkozy said, "he
<br>is a genius. A genius.  He has pursued exactly the right
<br>policies."
<br>
<br>FRANCE'S ECONOMIC CHALLENGES
<br>----------------------------
<br>¶11.  (C) Returning to his priorities for France, Sarkozy
<br>noted that France's biggest challenges were outsourcing, a
<br>lagging research sector, savings that are "too static and
<br>don't really help move the economy," and a lack of profitable
<br>mid-size companies; "we have lots of big ones and lots of
<br>really small ones, but few in between."  He sees natural
<br>strengths for France in the health, agriculture and food,
<br>transportation, communication and nuclear energy sectors.
<br>
<br>WORKING TOGETHER AT THE WTO
<br>---------------------------
<br>¶12.  (C) Responding to Mr. Hubbard's observation on the need
<br>for the Doha trade round to move forward this autumn, Sarkozy
<br>agreed, and noted that the EU needed to reach a better
<br>understanding with the U.S. on agricultural issues.  He said
<br>that U.S. and EU officials were talking but prescribed much
<br>more intensive discussion so that a common understanding
<br>could be reached.  If that happened, he believed the upcoming
<br>Hong Kong ministerial could be a success.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>¶13.  (C) For many years, Nicolas Sarkozy has been France's
<br>most popular politician.  Current polls show his approval
<br>ratings holding steady at around 60 percent, and defeating
<br>any probable opponent in 2007.  By experience and conviction
<br>-- his experience as interior minister and his "liberal,"
<br>free-market oriented convictions -- he seems particularly
<br>well-suited to lead France in meeting the key challenges it
<br>now faces: security in this era of global terrorism and
<br>prosperity in this era of adapting to economic globalization.
<br>In addition, Sarkozy's deep identification with American
<br>values -- opportunity, initiative, competition, society that
<br>sustains individual liberty as much as it supports national
<br>power, make him France's best hope for catalyzing the shift
<br>in social values that the French need to make if they are to
<br>take full advantage of globalization.
<br>
<br>COMMENT CONTINUED
<br>-----------------
<br>¶14. (C) Sarkozy's vision for France is a powerful one, and,
<br>as his popularity reflects, it resonates with a big part of
<br>the electorate.  However, resistance to social change is
<br>particularly strong in France.  Attachment to the benefits
<br>and advantages that most of them receive, in one way of
<br>another, from the state -- the substance of the "French
<br>social model" -- is very strong among ordinary French people.
<br>Sarkozy's popularity may be a reflection of change the
<br>French would like to make, but are too conservative to in
<br>fact undertake.  End Comment.
