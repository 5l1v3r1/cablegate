<br>Classified By: Amb. Eduardo A. Aguirre for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The Ambassador hosted former President Jose
<br>Maria Aznar for a private lunch at his residence on October
<br>¶16. President Aznar offered his opinions on the domestic
<br>political situation as well as the outlook in Latin America.
<br>He also told Ambassador of his satisfaction at seeing
<br>improved United States-Spain relations, despite the
<br>difficulties this presents to his party in opposition. He
<br>told the Ambassador that he fears the current government is
<br>presiding over the "Balkanization" of Spain. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) During their October 16 luncheon, former President
<br>Aznar told the Ambassador that he views with satisfaction the
<br>improving GOS relationship with the U.S. over the past year.
<br>Aznar said that, as a Spaniard, he accepts this as a positive
<br>development although it presents difficulties for his
<br>opposition Partido Popular (PP). (COMMENT: Maintaining the
<br>trans-Atlantic relationship has long been one of the PP's key
<br>platforms, and PP leaders have hammered Zapatero for
<br>upsetting ties with Washington. The PP has also criticized
<br>the Zapatero government for steps it has taken that are
<br>important to the U.S., such as the Spanish deployment to
<br>Afghanistan and Lebanon. While efforts to improve the
<br>bilateral relationship have eased the sting of this PP
<br>criticism, PP leaders apparently have viewed U.S.-Spain
<br>tensions as favorable to their interests. Aznar's comments
<br>may reflect a new approach on this subject. We have told
<br>both the PP and the Socialist Party now in power to avoid
<br>using the U.S. in their political football, as this benefits
<br>neither Spanish nor U.S. interests. END COMMENT.)
<br>
<br>//Argentina, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Mexico//
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Aznar told the Ambassador about his recent speaking
<br>tour in Latin America. He found that Argentina is
<br>increasingly turning inward and that internal politics will
<br>be the dominant force in Argentina for several years. In
<br>Chile, he told the Ambassador that President Bachelet is
<br>strongly influenced by her father's murder and her own
<br>torture during the Pinochet regime. Aznar said that these
<br>experiences are more profoundly shaping her executive
<br>decisions than he had previously believed. On Peru, Aznar
<br>expressed his belief that Alan Garcia is a "new man" who has
<br>cast aside the legacy of his previous administration and who
<br>is deeply committed to creating stability and economic
<br>opportunity. He also said that President Uribe appears very
<br>secure and established in Colombia. Aznar saw deep internal
<br>divisions in Mexico, but he noted that the U.S. border fence
<br>project is a unifying force of anti-American sentiment, to
<br>the detriment of U.S. relations with Mexico.
<br>
<br>//ETA, Basque Country and Catalonia//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Aznar said he fears that the GOS is presiding over
<br>the "Balkanization" of Spain, by allowing the autonomous
<br>communities greater independence. The PP feels that by
<br>allowing the 2006 Catalonia referendum on autonomy, the GOS
<br>has opened the floodgates to demands for greater local
<br>control. Worse, by entering into negotiations with ETA, the
<br>GOS has nearly legitimized the Basque self-determination
<br>movement. Aznar expressed his belief that the ongoing ETA
<br>negotiations will fail. He said that the only way to deal
<br>with ETA is as a criminal organization. The negotiations
<br>never had a chance for success, he said, because neither side
<br>ever had any room to maneuver or flexibility in their
<br>positions. According to Aznar, ETA will never abandon its
<br>demand for Basque self-determination, and the GOS can never
<br>agree to that demand.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Adhering to the party line, Aznar expressed
<br>confidence that the PP would win a slim plurality in the
<br>approaching Catalonia regional election. NOTE: Polling
<br>indicates that the Catalan "middle of the road" CiU party is
<br>likely to win the regional election, though it may have to
<br>form a tripartite coalition to govern (reftel). The PP is
<br>not even assured a place in that coalition, as it currently
<br>is polling at around 10 percent in the region. END NOTE.
