<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Coordinator for Afghanistan Maureen Quinn,
<br>accompanied by Department of Defense, JCS, and State
<br>Department officers met with Spanish MOD, MFA and Presidency
<br>officials on 1/26 to discuss Spain's commitment to lead a PRT
<br>in western Afghanistan. Just before Ambassador Quinn's
<br>arrival, the GOS released a brief statement indicating that
<br>it was "studying" the possibility of both a Spanish
<br>deployment to western Afghanistan and taking over the FSB in
<br>Herat. The MOD meeting will be reported via septel. GOS
<br>officials told the USG team that the press release was
<br>intended to convey Spain's determination to lead a PRT,
<br>though operational and political details remain to be worked
<br>out. MFA Director General for Foreign Policy Rafael
<br>Dezcallar described the PRT decision as one of several recent
<br>GOS gestures aimed at repairing bilateral relations with the
<br>USG. Dezcallar said that Foreign Minister Moratinos may
<br>travel to Afghanistan soon and that Spain may establish a
<br>permanent diplomatic mission in Kabul.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) At the Presidential Palace, Deputy National Security
<br>Advisor Maria Alonso stressed the Zapatero Government's need
<br>to build public support for the deployment, given the general
<br>Spanish skepticism towards overseas military missions of any
<br>type. She reviewed the steps necessary for the GOS to obtain
<br>Parliamentary approval of the PRT mission and said she was
<br>confident that the deployment would be approved with minimal
<br>debate. She said Spain would also like to further discuss
<br>the USG offer to consider providing civilian experts to aid
<br>the PRT, per REF A points. End Summary.
<br>
<br>//MFA: SPAIN COMMITTED TO AFGHANISTAN//
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) MOD DG for Policy Admiral Torrente confirmed to
<br>Ambassador Quinn that Spain plans to lead a PRT in western
<br>Afghanistan, specifically at Qal'eh-ye Now, and to contribute
<br>troops to the FSB at Herat. Full details of the MOD meeting
<br>will be provided septel.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) At the MFA, DG Dezcallar pointed to the success of
<br>ISAF and OEF operations in Afghanistan as a "demonstration
<br>that multilateralism can be effective" and said NATO could be
<br>proud of its work in "helping the Afghans help themselves."
<br>Ambassador Quinn agreed that much had been accomplished,
<br>especially through new models such as PRTs. She welcomed the
<br>news of Spain's decision to lead a PRT in western Afghanistan
<br>and to participate in the Herat FSB.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Dezcallar said the PRT decision was "intentionally
<br>leaked" by the GOS in order to convey Spain's commitment to
<br>the long-term reconstruction of Afghanistan. He said this
<br>was driven by strategic considerations, since Spain's
<br>investigation of the March 11 train bombings in Madrid
<br>suggested that the order to carry out the bombing had come
<br>from individuals based in Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>//NEXT STEPS ON SPANISH PRT//
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) While Dezcallar emphasized that the GOS has made the
<br>political decision to participate in a PRT, he also noted
<br>that several steps remain. First, Spain will send a team of
<br>MOD and MFA experts to Afghanistan to scout the precise
<br>locations where Spanish forces will be deployed: Herat and
<br>Qal'eh)ye Now (NOTE: The scouting team departed for
<br>Afghanistan on 1/28. END NOTE). Second, the GOS will analyze
<br>the report of the team and deliver a recommendation to
<br>President Zapatero as to how Spain's deployment should
<br>proceed. Lastly, President Zapatero will "consult" with
<br>Parliament to gain legislative support for the mission.
<br>
<br>//MENDING FENCES WITH USG//
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Dezcallar made clear that an important factor in
<br>Spain's decision to proceed with a PRT was their sense that
<br>it would help bring an end to bilateral tensions between
<br>Madrid and Washington. Dezcallar said he knew the USG
<br>appreciated actions more than words, so Spain had moved ahead
<br>on Afghanistan and other issues, including Spain's
<br>contribution of $20 million to the UNDP to support the Iraq
<br>elections, GOS diplomatic efforts to encourage good behavior
<br>on the part of Iraq's neighbors, and the decision of
<br>President Zapatero not to stop in Venezuela during his visit
<br>to Latin America. Dezcallar said he hoped these positive
<br>steps would be recognized by the USG and would encourage
<br>reciprocal gestures from Washington. He said "normalization"
<br>of ties with Spain would help both sides work together to
<br>advance the USG's "ambitious reform process" in the Mideast
<br>and suggested Spain's experience with the Barcelona Process
<br>could prove useful for the U.S. Ambassador Quinn said the
<br>USG appreciated the positive steps taken by the GOS and told
<br>Dezcallar that she would carry his message to Washington.
<br>
<br>//DEEPER SPANISH ROLE IN AFGHANISTAN//
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Dezcallar said that Foreign Minister Moratinos may
<br>travel to Afghanistan in the next several months. In
<br>addition, Spain hopes to establish a permanent diplomatic
<br>mission soon in Kabul and would eventually like to open an
<br>embassy. Ambassador Quinn encouraged this increased GOS
<br>engagement, saying the Afghan people were counting on the
<br>international community to help them realize their growing
<br>hopes for stability and economic growth. Dezcallar noted
<br>that the GOS has directed aid to Afghanistan through the
<br>Asian Development Bank, but would be willing to study other
<br>possible assistance projects, including on counter narcotics.
<br>
<br>
<br>//OEF)ISAF MERGER//
<br>¶9. (C) At Dezcallar's request, the USG team briefed him on
<br>the security situation in Afghanistan and the state of play
<br>among the various regional leaders and factions. Dezcallar
<br>said he was encouraged by the USG's information regarding
<br>improved security conditions and suggested that coordination
<br>between ISAF and OEF operations will have to improve and
<br>perhaps even be merged as ISAF moves westward. (NOTE: We
<br>assume Dezcallar was suggesting the merger of the missions
<br>under an overall NATO command, since it is highly unlikely
<br>the GOS would place Spanish forces at the disposition of a
<br>U.S. command through participation in OEF. END NOTE.)
<br>Ambassador Quinn agreed that integration is the right move,
<br>but said that we have no set timeline. She noted the already
<br>high level of coordination between OEF and ISAF personnel.
<br>
<br>//PRESIDENCY: A FEW BUMPS ON THE ROAD TO PRT//
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In her meeting with Deputy National Security Advisers
<br>Maria Alonso and Diego de Ojeda, Ambassador Quinn expressed
<br>the USG's appreciation of Spain's decision to lead a PRT and
<br>to contribute forces to the FSB in Herat. Alonso, who covers
<br>the North America account, said the GOS was pleased that the
<br>MOD and MFA had presented a good plan for Spain's
<br>participation and that the GOS now had to explain the mission
<br>to a public skeptical of any Spanish military deployment
<br>abroad. Alonso was confident that the GOS would have no
<br>problem in gaining Parliamentary approval for the deployment
<br>since the Popular Party, the largest opposition party,
<br>supported the NATO mission in Afghanistan. However, Diego de
<br>Ojeda pointed out that the PRT proposal would have to be
<br>slipped in between major legislative action on controversial
<br>internal issues, perhaps briefly delaying formal approval of
<br>the PRT. Also the two small leftist parties that generally
<br>work with the Socialists to give them a Parliamentary
<br>majority will vote against Spain's leadership of a PRT,
<br>creating a minor, but unwelcome rift within the center-left.
<br>
<br>//USG SUPPORT//
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Alonso indicated that Spain wants to emphasize the
<br>civil reconstruction aspect of its PRT, but lacks civilian
<br>experts to support that element of the mission. Spain hopes
<br>to establish strong links to NGOs already operating in
<br>western Afghanistan. Alonso also alluded to the USG offer
<br>per REF A to consider making U.S. civilian experts available
<br>to buttress the Spanish deployment, saying Spain would
<br>appreciate such assistance. Ambassador Quinn and Alonso
<br>discussed the makeup of the existing PRTs and the USG team
<br>urged Spain to study all of the models in developing its own
<br>plans.
