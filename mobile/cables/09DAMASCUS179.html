<br>SUBJECT: PRESIDENT ASAD AND CODEL CARDIN DISCUSS A NUCLEAR 
<br>IRAN, PEACE PROCESS, TERRORISM, AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Maura Connelly for reasons 1.4 (b) and 
<br> (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) SUMMARY: CODEL Cardin, in a February 18 meeting with 
<br>President Bashar al-Asad, FM Muallim, Presidential Advisor 
<br>for Political and Media Affairs Shaaban, and Ambassador to 
<br>the U.S. Mustafa conveyed U.S. concerns regarding Iran's 
<br>pursuit of a nuclear weapon, Syrian human rights abuses, the 
<br>Israel-Syria peace process, upcoming Lebanese elections, and 
<br>Syrian support for terrorism.  Senator Cardin encouraged the 
<br>SARG to address these issues in order to lay the groundwork 
<br>for a more productive future dialogue.  Asad argued Syria 
<br>essentially shared the same position as the U.S. on the 
<br>majority of these issues, but Syria's approach toward solving 
<br>these problems was clearly different.  Asad said the U.S. 
<br>needed to look at the larger regional political picture, as 
<br>Syria did, if it truly wanted to find satisfactory 
<br>resolutions.  On Iran, Asad maintained IAEA monitoring would 
<br>ensure Iran's pursuit of nuclear power for civilian purposes 
<br>only.  Regarding human rights, Asad stated Syria was making 
<br>progress, but the CODEL needed to understand this issue in 
<br>the larger context of Israel's aggression in Gaza, the 
<br>suffering of Palestinian refugees, and terrorist attacks on 
<br>Syria.  Asad rejected the notion that Syria facilitated the 
<br>transit of foreign fighters into Iraq, pointedly asking the 
<br>CODEL what interest would he have in doing so?  The upcoming 
<br>elections in Lebanon, Asad surmised, would not change the 
<br>composition of the government dramatically nor Syria's 
<br>determination to continue the process of establishing a full 
<br>diplomatic presence in Beirut.  On future Israel-Syria peace 
<br>negotiations, Asad was more vague.  He offered no specifics 
<br>on re-opening talks, but expressed Syria's desire for the 
<br>process to continue with U.S. involvement.  Finally, in 
<br>response to the CODEL's repeated concerns about Syrian 
<br>support for Hamas and Hizballah, Asad remarked that these 
<br>were democratically elected organizations in the Palestinian 
<br>Authority and Lebanon; dealing with them was simply part of 
<br>the reality of politics in the Middle East.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>The Opening Gambit: Human Rights 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Following a warm exchange of pleasantries in which 
<br>Senator Cardin thanked Asad for sending Imad Mustafa to the 
<br>U.S. as Syria's Ambassador ("He's in our offices so much 
<br>we've thought of charging him rent!"), Senator Cardin noted 
<br>the CODEL had come to Syria for two major reasons: (1) As a 
<br>fact-finding mission with an eye toward reinvigorating the 
<br>Syria-Israel peace process; and (2) to learn more about the 
<br>Iraqi refugee situation.  Senator Cardin added "there are new 
<br>opportunities . . . The U.S. has a new president who wants to 
<br>work" with countries in the region.  Regarding Syria, he 
<br>said, "there are areas of major concern," one of them being 
<br>Syria's human rights record.  Senator Cardin told Asad he 
<br>could give specific examples of citizens jailed for their 
<br>political views.  Asad responded, "we are a country in 
<br>process of reform.  We aren't perfect.  You are talking about 
<br>12 people out of 20 million.  It's a process. We are moving 
<br>forward, not fast, but methodically." (NOTE: Asad's mention 
<br>of "12 people" refers to the 12 members of the Damascus 
<br>Declaration National Council convicted in October 2008 and 
<br>sentenced to two and a half years in prison. END NOTE). 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Asad admitted Syria had very strong security laws, but 
<br>argued they were necessary to protect the nation.  The 
<br>members of the Damascus Declaration had been convicted for 
<br>their "contact with an individual in Lebanon who had invited 
<br>the U.S. to attack Syria.  This is against our law."  Senator 
<br>Cardin replied he realized this was a domestic issue; he was 
<br>not asking Syria to be exactly like the U.S., but Syria 
<br>should nonetheless adhere to widely accepted international 
<br>standards.  Senator Cardin argued that "when the U.S. is 
<br>challenged, you see it on the front page of the newspaper" 
<br>and that such challenges were an important part of a national 
<br>dialogue.  "You do not see this (freedom of expression) 
<br>anywhere in the region," Asad chuckled in reply, "let's talk 
<br>about Saudi Arabia." 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Widening the human rights conversation beyond the 
<br>scope of Syrian prisoners of conscience, Asad admonished the 
<br>CODEL for focusing on 12 individuals without taking into 
<br>account half a million Palestinian refugees in Syria alone, 
<br>and the continued suffering of people in Gaza.  "Human 
<br>rights," Asad philosophized, "is related to the whole 
<br>upgrading of society.  This will produce new laws."  In a 
<br>final bid to put the subject of human rights to rest, Asad 
<br>stated he was a popular president and that if he were working 
<br>against his people, he would not enjoy such popularity. 
<br>"Don't worry about human rights, we're moving forward," he 
<br>said. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Turning to conflict and reform in the region, Asad 
<br>observed many societies in the region (including Syria) were 
<br>experiencing a shift in political alignment to the right.  As 
<br>a result, the process of political reform had become 
<br>increasingly difficult.  Asad warned that countries, like 
<br>Lebanon and Algeria, which had strived for rapid reform in 
<br>the past, had only set the stage for more conflict.  In the 
<br>case of Algeria during the 1980s, Islamists had tried to use 
<br>a sudden political opening to gain power and this had sparked 
<br>a conflict lasting twenty years.  Similarly, Asad continued, 
<br>Lebanon's reform process and the May 29 elections had been 
<br>the cause of the subsequent sectarian violence.  Asad 
<br>contended the real issues were "peace and fighting 
<br>terrorism." 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>The Middle Game: A Nuclear Iran 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Senator Whitehouse raised Iran, agreeing with Senator 
<br>Cardin's assessment of the new political terrain and 
<br>asserting: "We have a moment of opportunity for new 
<br>policies." Whitehouse cautioned Asad that it was also "a time 
<br>for choices."  The manner in which the U.S. would proceed 
<br>depended on "honest, sustained cooperation in the region," he 
<br>said.  The senator emphasized the time-frame for this 
<br>cooperation was quite short.  The one thing that could bring 
<br>it to a premature close would be Iran's development of 
<br>nuclear weapons. "If Iran insists," Senator Whitehorse 
<br>stated, "it will create an atmosphere challenging for 
<br>negotiations." 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Asad swiftly responded, "we're not convinced Iran is 
<br>developing nuclear weapons."  He argued Iran could not use a 
<br>nuclear weapon as a deterrent because nobody believed Iran 
<br>would actually use it against Israel.  Asad noted an Iranian 
<br>nuclear strike against Israel would result in massive 
<br>Palestinian casualties, which Iran would never risk. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Second, he continued, the IAEA had reported no 
<br>evidence of a nuclear weapons program in Iran existed. 
<br>Arguing Syria and the U.S. were actually closer than they 
<br>realized on these issues, Asad said Syria adamantly opposed 
<br>any "weapons of mass destruction" in the Middle East.  But as 
<br>signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
<br>Weapons (NPT) both Iran and Syria had the right to pursue 
<br>nuclear power for civilian purposes.  Asad asserted demands 
<br>for Iran to "stop" its nuclear program were unproductive and 
<br>a violation of its rights under the NPT.  Instead, he said, 
<br>"the argument should be about how to monitor their program," 
<br>as outlined in the NPT.  "Without this monitoring," Asad 
<br>warned, "there will be confrontation, and it will be 
<br>difficult for the whole region."  Asad leaned slightly 
<br>forward and said: "Let's work together on this point." 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Senator Whitehorse replied, "I hope monitoring is 
<br>enough," noting the difficulty of such a project in a closed 
<br>society such as Iran.  Asad responded an international system 
<br>for monitoring was in place and should be followed.  Senator 
<br>Cardin interjected, "we believe Iran's goals are the opposite 
<br>of what you describe.  We think they want to change the 
<br>equation" (of power in the region).  Asad asked the CODEL to 
<br>put aside this point of view and focus on monitoring. Senator 
<br>Cardin said, "we agree on monitoring, but we think Iran 
<br> 
<br>should give up its nuclear ambitions."  Asad reiterated 
<br>monitoring was the best institutional way to control Iran's 
<br>nuclear program.  Senator Wicker challenged Asad's assertion 
<br>Iran was not seeking to develop nuclear weapons and that 
<br>monitoring alone would work. Asad replied his impression was 
<br>that Iran's program was for peacful purposes with the caveat 
<br>"we have no evidence as we are not in Iran."  Senator Wicker 
<br>advised Asad the international community assessed otherwise; 
<br>the question now was what the appropriate response to Iran 
<br>should be.  "Everyone wants to avoid a military reaction," he 
<br>noted, "but it was the clear view of the former 
<br>administration and is the clear view of the current 
<br>administration that something will have to be done."  Asad 
<br>observed "you have my impression.  Everything you mention is 
<br>guessing.  Monitoring will make everything clear." 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Representative Moore argued that while monitoring was 
<br>a mechanism appropriate to "nation states," it would not be 
<br>effective in controlling Iran's military proxies, Hamas and 
<br>Hizballah.  She stated both Syria and Iran provided financial 
<br>support to the two groups and there was no way to rule out 
<br>categorically the possibility that Iran might provide nuclear 
<br>material to Hizballah.  "The ability of the international 
<br>community to monitor Iran on NPT is understood.  It's the 
<br>role of the proxies that is the problem," she said.  Asad 
<br>replied, "if you don't trust the mechanisms of the NPT, let's 
<br>cancel it."  He maintained these proxies "would go away" if 
<br>there was a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace agreement.  He 
<br>asked who had created these proxies?  "We didn't and Iran 
<br>didn't.  How were they created?  By conflict because Lebanon 
<br>was occupied by Israel.  It's normal to have resistance. 
<br>This is the reality we have to deal with." 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>Testing The Flank: Lebanon 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Senator Wicker asked Asad to give his prognosis for 
<br>the upcoming Lebanese elections, the prospect of Syria 
<br>sending an ambassador, and whether Hizballah would disarm. 
<br>In a tone of resigned pessimism, Asad replied that the 
<br>Lebanese elections would not make much of a difference.  In 
<br>Lebanon, he explained, any party can get a "veto third." 
<br>Asad maintained the key issue was whether the Lebanese would 
<br>vote along political lines or sectarian lines.  If the latter 
<br>occurred, then Shi'as would elect Shi'as, Christians would 
<br>elect Christians, and so on, which would result in conflict. 
<br>"If you don't have consensus, you will have civil war.  This 
<br>is how it has always been in Lebanon," he said.  Conflict in 
<br>Lebanon would preclude normal relations between the two 
<br>countries. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) On the subject of a Syrian ambassador to Lebanon, 
<br>Asad characterized the delayed appointment as being part of a 
<br>deliberate political process.  Asad pointed out Syria had 
<br>opened an embassy and staffed it, actions they would not have 
<br>taken if they did not fully intend to send an ambassador. 
<br>Asad argued an appointment like this was a political step 
<br>requiring the proper timing.  He added "we know who and when, 
<br>but we're not going to announce it today."  Senator Wicker 
<br>deftly rejoined "we could make news!" eliciting laughter from 
<br>everyone, including Asad. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Regarding the disarmament of Hizballah, Asad argued 
<br>"Hizballah has no specific interest in Israel besides 
<br>securing Lebanon's borders and preventing threats to 
<br>Lebanon's integrity, like Israel's daily violations of 
<br>Lebanese airspace."  Asad noted Hizballah was the most 
<br>powerful political party in Lebanon, was democratically 
<br>elected, and if peace in the region were to be achieved, "the 
<br>small things" with Hizballah and Hamas would disappear. 
<br>"Let's talk about the peace.  This is the big picture that 
<br>will solve everything."  Asad likened the U.S.'s approach to 
<br>Hizballah to trying to patch an old suit when a new suit was 
<br>needed.  Senator Cardin countered that peace would very 
<br>likely go forward if Syria would stop the arms flow to 
<br>Hizballah.  The senator noted many countries thought Syria 
<br>was concerned about possible repercussions with Iran if it 
<br> 
<br>were to take the initiative on stopping arms to Hizballah. 
<br>Asad responded Syria had been in negotiations with Israel 
<br>with no concern for Iran's opinion.  He told the story of how 
<br>Iranian President Ahmedinejad called him just before the 
<br>Annapolis conference and implored him not to send anyone, 
<br>that it was a "bad meeting," but that they sent a 
<br>representative anyway. "I told him I know it (Annapolis) is 
<br>just a photo op.  But I am sending someone anyway.  We do 
<br>what we think is good for our interests; it's not dependent 
<br>on Iran," he contended. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>A New Tempo: The Peace Process 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S) Senator Tom Udall asked what message Asad wanted the 
<br>CODEL to deliver to the new administration. Asad replied he 
<br>saw two key common interests between Syria and the U.S.: 
<br>peace in the region and combating terrorism.  Asad argued 
<br>Syria had been at the forefront of fighting terrorism ever 
<br>since it put down the Muslim Brotherhood in 1982.  He claimed 
<br>that in the mid-1980s, Syria had sent a delegation to Europe 
<br>to articulate the need for a coalition to fight terrorism, 
<br>but nobody had listened.  Asad said Syria wanted to know when 
<br>the U.S. would adopt a new approach toward terrorism, adding 
<br>that "it's not a question of how much you can destroy, but 
<br>how much dialogue you can make."  The Europeans, Asad 
<br>continued, knew more about the region than the U.S. and he 
<br>urged the CODEL to turn to them for guidance.  Asad stated 
<br>the U.S. and Syria shared a common interest on "70 percent" 
<br>of the issues at hand, the difference was all in "point of 
<br>view, principles, culture, and approach."  Keen to press the 
<br>topic of engagement, Asad attempted to refute the idea that a 
<br>new dialogue would only make Syria stronger: "No, you make 
<br>yourselves stronger because you have interests in the region." 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) Agreeing that dialogue was crucial and an essential 
<br>component of the Helsinki Commission, Senator Cardin advised 
<br>Asad that if he were serious about engagement, he would expel 
<br>Hamas leaders from Syria.  Asad replied, "What if Hamas 
<br>supported peace?"  Senator Cardin explained Hamas was a 
<br>symbol--it launched rockets into non-military areas and this 
<br>was the definition of terrorism.  Asad replied Hamas was an 
<br>uninvited guest; it was really the very Muslim Brotherhood 
<br>organization Syria had combatted through the 1980s.  "If you 
<br>want me to be effective and active, I have to have a 
<br>relationship with all parties.  Hamas is Muslim Brotherhood, 
<br>but we have to deal with the reality of their presence." 
<br>Senator Cardin pointed out not expelling Hamas sent a signal 
<br>to the international community that Iran, given its support 
<br>for Hamas, might be making the decisions in Damascus. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>En Passant: The DCS, ACC and ALC 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (C) When confronted with Senator Cardin's observation 
<br>that the SARG's closure of the Damascus Community School 
<br>(DCS), the American Culture Center (ACC), and the American 
<br>Language Center (ALC) had hurt Syrians more than Americans, 
<br>Asad assured the CODEL that this was merely a public 
<br>relations gesture on his part.  "We were attacked by the U.S. 
<br>army," Asad replied, "Seven civilians were killed.  I had two 
<br>choices: fight the U.S. army or do something symbolic.  It's 
<br>something temporary. You'll open it next year."  Senator 
<br>Cardin told Asad he understood "symbolic gestures, but not 
<br>when they hurt your own people." 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>The End Game: Foreign Fighters 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) "What interest does Syria have in letting foreign 
<br>fighters go to Iraq?" Asad pointedly asked in response to 
<br>Representative McIntyre's question about why Syria had not 
<br>done more to monitor and staunch the flow of transiting 
<br>fighters across the Syria-Iraq border.  Asad continued: "Can 
<br>you stop the immigration of Mexicans into the U.S.? No. All 
<br> 
<br>borders are porous.  There is no army on the border; you 
<br>don't have soldiers on the border.  Do your homework.  My job 
<br>is to protect my people, not your soldiers.  We have 
<br>terrorists.  Two months ago there was a car bomb in Syria and 
<br>that car came from Iraq." (NOTE: We assume Asad is referring 
<br>to the September 27, 2008 car bomb attack against a SARG 
<br>military facility, though Syrian Military Intelligence has 
<br>reportedly stopped several cars rigged with explosives since 
<br>then. END NOTE).  Asad noted that the lack of cooperation 
<br>with military forces in Iraq contributed to the problem. 
<br>With Turkey, he said, the border was more complicated and the 
<br>terrain worse, but because Syria enjoyed better cooperation 
<br>it was less porous. 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) Asad recounted how when (then NEA A/S) William Burns 
<br>and representatives from the Army and CIA came to Damascus, 
<br>"we said we were ready to cooperate.  We took the delegation 
<br>to the border, then after they left we waited for a proposal, 
<br>but nothing came of it. They didn't want to cooperate."  Asad 
<br>added Syria lacked the financial and technical means, such as 
<br>night-vision goggles, to tighten its control of the area. 
<br>Asad then said, somewhat contradicting himself, that 80 
<br>percent of controlling the border was about controlling the 
<br>country. Representative McIntyre asked, "but are you willing 
<br>to monitor (the border)?"  The president demurred, "this is a 
<br>different problem," at which point Ambassador Mustafa 
<br>interjected with "I will brief you on the details." 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) The three main objectives Asad felt the U.S. and 
<br>Syria should work on were (1) Eliminating WMD in the region; 
<br>(2) pursuing a shared interest in a stable Iraq; and (3) 
<br>working for peace and combating terrorism.  Asad re-affirmed 
<br>that Syria was not an enemy of the U.S., "I have saved 
<br>American lives." In 2002, Asad explained, he passed 
<br>information to the King of Bahrain about an imminent attack 
<br>on American citizens.  Ambassador Mustafa added that then 
<br>Secretary of State Colin Powell had sent the Syrian 
<br>government a letter expressing his gratitude for its 
<br>assistance.  If the U.S. wished for similar coordination in 
<br>the future, Syria could not begin security cooperation 
<br>without concomitant political cooperation, Asad stated. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) COMMENT: Beginning with the visit of President Carter 
<br>last December, President Asad's exposure to U.S. politicians 
<br>has steadily increased.  This encounter was a good example of 
<br>how Asad has been able to hone his responses to U.S. 
<br>accusations that Syria is a bad actor in the region.  At no 
<br>point in the conversation did Asad ask about the appointment 
<br>of a U.S. ambassador to Syria or economic sanctions, which 
<br>suggests to us that he is doing everything possible to avoid 
<br>the appearance of being the supplicant, despite the Syrian 
<br>press's heavy focus on Syria's desire to see an end to 
<br>sanctions and the appointment of a U.S. ambassador. 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED: We have heard anecdotally that 
<br>Asad was not pleased with the tenor or substance of his 
<br>meeting with the CODEL.  The SARG is reportedly interpreting 
<br>the group's position on Iran, Iraq, Hizballah, and human 
<br>rights to be a continuation of, rather than a departure from, 
<br>the previous Administration's policy toward Syria.  We note 
<br>that the CODEL's discussion with Asad was frank but cordial. 
<br>Senator Cardin and the CODEL members aired U.S. policy 
<br>concerns publicly from their perspective as elected 
<br>legislators in press remarks, framed in the context of their 
<br>desire to explore whether cooperation with Syria is viable. 
<br>The Syrian press and many of our interlocutors have come to 
<br>view re-engagement with the U.S. as a fait accompli, as 
<br>something long-overdue and very much owed to Syria.  Asad's 
<br>displeasure with the CODEL may be his first recognition that 
<br>U.S.-Syria bilateral relations will require more on his end 
<br>than originally anticipated. END COMMENT.
