<br>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH KEY SARKOZY ADVISOR FRANCOIS 
<br>FILLON 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: Sarkozy advisor and former Education 
<br>Minister Francois Fillon told the Ambassador December 20 that 
<br>Sarkozy had a chance to buck the French predisposition to 
<br>vote against the ruling party in 2007 by focusing his 
<br>presidential campaign on the electorate's deep-seated desire 
<br>for real "change." Fillon argued that the victor in 2007 
<br>would need to make the presidency more personally accountable 
<br>and involved in explaining government policy to the populace. 
<br>The EU, in Fillon's opinion, is struggling under the weight 
<br>of new members, and it was time to bring the UK into the 
<br>Franco-German union in order to move the body forward. 
<br>Fillon believed transatlantic relations would be more cordial 
<br>under a Sarkozy presidency; although disagreements would 
<br>certainly arise, they would be handled in a more nuanced 
<br>manner. Fillon elaborated on Sarkozy's plan to improve the 
<br>French economy through welfare reform and greater flexibility 
<br>for businesses, and offered his own views on needed changes 
<br>for the French education system. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>2007 Elections 
<br>-------------- 
<br>¶2. (SBU) The Ambassador met December 20 with Francois 
<br>Fillon, former Minister of Education (2004-2005) and Social 
<br>Affairs, Labor, and Solidarity (2002-2004) in the Raffarin 
<br>government, who was named in July 2005 to be the Political 
<br>Counselor to Nicolas Sarkozy in his role as president of the 
<br>Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). Fillon noted the 
<br>instability of the French Fifth Republic compared to the 
<br>governments of Germany and the UK, and commented that the 
<br>French electorate always voted for change. This suggested 
<br>that the Socialist Party (PS) should logically win in 2007, 
<br>but Sarkozy had a chance because he was a strong proponent 
<br>for change, whereas the PS had turned into a party of 
<br>"restoration" of the status quo ante. He insisted that most 
<br>French voters really do want change, although he conceded 
<br>that they are also afraid of losing what they have. Chirac 
<br>always erred on the side of French fears rather than a desire 
<br>for change and Villepin's big liability would be that he is 
<br>seen as a continuation of Chirac. Sarkozy, by contrast, was 
<br>betting that people really wanted reform. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Fillon believed that Sarkozy would remain in the 
<br>government until January of 2007, when the UMP would 
<br>officially nominate its presidential candidate, at which time 
<br>he would break with Chirac/Villepin to run for the 
<br>presidency. He said that Chirac and Villepin would do 
<br>everything possible in the meantime to trip him up. The 
<br>recent unrest in the suburbs had not hurt Sarkozy, Fillon 
<br>noted, because he was seen as taking action on the issue. 
<br>Fillon did not foresee a cohabitation government, saying, 
<br>"The people will choose a president and give him a majority" 
<br>in Parliament. 
<br>
<br>Institutional Reform 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>¶4. (SBU) Elaborating on his statement that the French Fifth 
<br>Republic is inherently "unstable," Fillon said there was a 
<br>need to move to a presidential system in which the president 
<br>would have to take a more active role in explaining the 
<br>government's actions to the people and the parliament. (The 
<br>only such public appearance by Chirac was his disastrous Town 
<br>Hall-style appearance in early May in favor of the EU 
<br>Constitution.) While there were also arguments in favor of a 
<br>more parliamentary system, Fillon said that it would be 
<br>impossible to convince the French electorate to abandon the 
<br>election of a president by universal suffrage. Nor was in 
<br>possible any longer for the president to remain above the 
<br>fray, he said, then blame everything on the PM. The move to 
<br>a five-year presidential term of office had reinforced this 
<br>trend. He characterized what he said was a PS plan to weaken 
<br>the powers of the presidency in favor of the prime minister 
<br>as "unrealistic." 
<br>
<br>The EU 
<br>------ 
<br>¶5. (SBU) The EU currently suffered from a lack of direction 
<br>and leadership, Fillon said. He explained that enlargement 
<br>was the main problem, which made it difficult to take 
<br>decisions efficiently. "We can hardly express ourselves in 
<br>meetings" with 25 members, he lamented, since there was no 
<br>time to take the floor more than once. In order to move the 
<br>EU forward, Fillon saw a need to expand the Franco-German 
<br>"couple" into a Franco-Germano-British "menage a trois." His 
<br>basic point was that it was hollow to think that Europe could 
<br>progress without the UK. He saw the emergence of Angela 
<br>Merkel as positive, while commenting that Chirac was trying 
<br>to make his relationship with her appear closer than it was 
<br>in the vane of the mythical Franco-German tandem. Returning 
<br>to his analysis of the French electorate, Fillon argued that 
<br>the May 29 French referendum vote was not a rejection of 
<br>change or Europe, but in fact a vote for a more radical 
<br>overhaul of the system. This coincided with the tendency of 
<br>the French to vote against the current government, which had 
<br>backed the EU Constitution. However, Fillon conceded this 
<br>was his interpretation, and that it was difficult at the 
<br>moment to accurately draw conclusions from the referendum 
<br>vote. 
<br>
<br>U.S.-French Relations 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>¶6. (SBU) Fillon thought a Sarkozy government would better be 
<br>able to work together with the U.S., and be less overtly 
<br>critical and more nuanced in its public statements. Under 
<br>Sarkozy, he continued, disagreements would not as easily lead 
<br>to blow-ups with close and vital allies. At the same time, 
<br>he cautioned, this would not change the very real 
<br>anti-American sentiments of some parts of the French 
<br>populace. In response to the Ambassador's comment that 
<br>France is perceived as an obstacle to U.S. ambitions for 
<br>NATO, Fillon noted that there needed to be a better balance 
<br>in NATO between Europe and the U.S. First, however, he said 
<br>that Europeans themselves needed to be clearer about their 
<br>priorities. Separately, Fillon noted that Sarkozy did not 
<br>necessarily see the need for high levels of defense spending. 
<br>
<br>Economy 
<br>------- 
<br>¶7. (SBU) On economic issues, Fillon called for fusing 
<br>welfare with unemployment so that the unemployed would be 
<br>more compelled to take jobs they were offered. He noted that 
<br>a Sarkozy economic system would push for more flexibility for 
<br>businesses and a simplification of the work codes. He also 
<br>advocated breaking the power of unions, including requiring 
<br>that elections be held every several years with open 
<br>candidacies. 
<br>
<br>Education 
<br>--------- 
<br>¶8. (SBU) Fillon spoke at length about giving schools more 
<br>autonomy (citing this as yet another area where Europe was 
<br>falling behind), but stopped short of recommending 
<br>decentralization. He criticized the burdensome bureaucracy 
<br>of the education system and lamented that the short time that 
<br>leaders remain in power limited their ability to effect 
<br>change. Increasing immigration required adaptation of the 
<br>system, but France had avoided such adjustments. He thought 
<br>universities should become independent, and that communes 
<br>should assume more responsibility for early education. He 
<br>talked about using limited resources for overtime pay for 
<br>those teachers willing and most able. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>¶9. (SBU) Fillon came across as a seasoned, non-dogmatic, and 
<br>serious political figure. He appeared pragmatic, 
<br>forthcoming, accessible, and open to continued dialogue. He 
<br>has commented publicly on his disappointment at not being 
<br>included in the Villepin government because of his support of 
<br>Sarkozy. Fillon is among Sarkozy's closest advisors, and is 
<br>considered a potential prime ministerial candidate should 
<br>Sarkozy be elected president in 2007. End Comment.
