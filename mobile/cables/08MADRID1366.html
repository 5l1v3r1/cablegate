<br>SECRETARY SHANNON 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Acting Deputy Chief of Mission William H. Duncan, for re 
<br>asons 1.4(b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (SBU) Embassy Madrid warmly welcomes your visit to Spain. 
<br>U.S.-Spanish relations are strong and based on shared global 
<br>interests, including the fight against terrorism, the 
<br>bilateral military relationship, our association in NATO, and 
<br>rapidly expanding economic ties.  Your Spanish interlocutors 
<br>will be eager to share their assessment of financial 
<br>developments and bilateral relations, and they will be eager 
<br>to hear your perspective on the incoming U.S. Administration 
<br>and prospects for cooperation.  Most of all, they will seek 
<br>your prognosis for Latin America and for Spanish-U.S. and 
<br>U.S.-EU cooperation to ensure democracy and prosperity in the 
<br>Western Hemisphere.  The GOS is sensitive to the importance 
<br>of  U.S. involvement and investment in the region, but 
<br>sometimes GOS officials suggest the USG has "abandoned" Latin 
<br>America.  Your visit presents a timely opportunity to counter 
<br>these assertions while inviting Spain to take more concrete 
<br>steps to promote democracy and good governance. 
<br> 
<br>//YOUR SCHEDULE IN MADRID// 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) The Ambassador looks forward to meeting with you upon 
<br>your arrival and is pleased to invite you to stay at the 
<br>Residence while you are here.  Your program includes what we 
<br>hope will be quality interaction with your Spanish 
<br>counterparts, extensive media outreach to the top Spanish 
<br>news outlets, a gathering of thinktankers and Latin 
<br>Americanists, and a public roundtable forum on U.S. and 
<br>Spanish approaches to Latin America.  Secretary of State for 
<br>Latin American Affairs Trinidad Jimenez will join you at the 
<br>roundtable January 9 and will host a lunch in your honor 
<br>January 8.  Spain's Secretary of State for International 
<br>Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, will participate in the lunch, 
<br>providing an opportunity to discuss improved coordination of 
<br>our foreign assistance programs.  The DCM will host a 
<br>representational dinner January 8 to include our key Latin 
<br>American contacts at the leading Spanish thinktanks.  Carlos 
<br>Malamud (Instituto Real Elcano) and Jose Herrera (FAES) among 
<br>others look forward to welcoming you back to Madrid. 
<br>One-on-one interviews with Spain's leading print and 
<br>broadcast media -- and through Cadena SER and Television 
<br>Espanola to their Western Hemisphere affiliates -- will 
<br>complete your visit and magnify your messages not just to 
<br>Spanish publics but throughout Latin America. 
<br> 
<br>//BILATERAL RELATIONS// 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (SBU) Spain is an important friend and ally of the U.S. 
<br>We especially value Spanish cooperation in the fights against 
<br>terrorism, narcotics, and human trafficking.  Spanish troops 
<br>are carrying out important missions in countries such as 
<br>Afghanistan and Lebanon.  Spain has long fought a domestic 
<br>terrorist threat from the Basque terrorist group ETA and 
<br>suffered tragically from Islamic extremist terrorism in the 
<br>March 2004 Madrid train bombings.  We need to be innovative 
<br>in finding new and improved avenues for bilateral and 
<br>multilateral cooperation against the threats we both face. 
<br>It would be worth discussing increased cooperation against 
<br>Latin American narcotics traffickers.  Spain is the principal 
<br>point of entry for South American cocaine coming to Europe 
<br>and has a serious domestic drug consumption problem.  Since 
<br>winning a second term in March 2008, President Zapatero has 
<br>publicly and privately stressed his desire to further improve 
<br>bilateral relations.  The relationship will be of increasing 
<br>importance when Spain takes over the EU presidency in January 
<br>¶2010.  After 15 years of rapid economic growth, Spain is now 
<br>in recession as the result of the end in 2007 of its long 
<br>housing boom and the international financial crisis.  The 
<br>unaccustomed hard times have hurt support for Zapatero, who 
<br>has at times tried to place the blame for Spain's 
<br>difficulties on the United States. 
<br> 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>¶11. (SBU) Possible VP Biden Visit - The Spanish press have 
<br>reported obsessively on the fact that Presidents Bush and 
<br>Zapatero have not met (Zapatero finally visited the White 
<br>House during the November 15 G-20 financial summit).  They 
<br>followed closely statements during the presidential campaign 
<br>by Senators Obama and McCain and their spokesmen about the 
<br>possibility of meeting with Zapatero.  GOS officials made no 
<br> 
<br>secret of their satisfaction with the results of our 
<br>elections, and they may have unrealistic expectations about 
<br>how soon the new President will visit Spain, or Zapatero 
<br>Washington.  Spanish officials informed reporters recently 
<br>that Vice President-elect Biden had told Zapatero in a 
<br>November 17 phone conversation that he would visit Spain 
<br>shortly after taking office to discuss the global financial 
<br>crisis.  The Vice President-elect also was said to have 
<br>mentioned the importance the President-elect places on 
<br>bilateral relations and highlighted the possibility for 
<br>cooperation on Latin America.  We have not heard any 
<br>confirmation of this from U.S. sources.
