<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Janice G. Weiner for reasons 1.4(b), 
<br> (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary.  Ever since its victory in the 2002 general 
<br>elections, rumours and suspicion have swirled around the 
<br>ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) "secret" 
<br>Islamist agenda.  After more than four years in power, some 
<br>doubters are relieved to find an AKP that appears 
<br>conservative, Western- as well as Islam-oriented, reform 
<br>minded and democratic.  Others remain convinced that AKP is 
<br>determined to impose Sharia law in Turkey and undermine the 
<br>country's secular system once it gains control of the triple 
<br>crown - the presidency, prime ministry and parliament - in 
<br>this year's double elections.  The evidence either way is 
<br>circumstantial, but the issue is central to Turkey's future. 
<br>Turkey's traditional secularists (including the civil 
<br>service, judiciary and military), opposition parties and even 
<br>ultra and neo-nationalists are resorting to increasingly 
<br>desperate maneuvers, including rumour and innuendo, to 
<br>counter the perceived "threat" of an AKP-dominated 
<br>triumverate.  Their concern is undoubtedly heightened by the 
<br>realization that AKP's reform agenda threatens the 
<br>established elite's traditional, top-down control.  To keep 
<br>the public's trust and minimize tension as Turkish society 
<br>evolves, AKP leaders will need to continue to employ 
<br>broad-reaching, moderate, balanced rhetoric.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>The Origins of Suspicion 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>¶2. (SBU)  Those looking to brand the AKP as Islamists 
<br>determined to undermine the Turkish Republic point first to 
<br>the AKP's religious origins and PM Erdogan's political roots. 
<br> AKP evolved from Necmettin Erbakan's Welfare Party (RP), an 
<br>Islamist party founded in 1993.  Critics focus on Erdogan, 
<br>who in 1994 as Istanbul's mayor, called himself the "imam of 
<br>Istanbul" and praised God that he was a servant of Sharia. 
<br>Later, in 1998, Erdogan served four months of a 10-month 
<br>sentence for inciting religious hatred by reading a religious 
<br>poem at a rally.  When the Constitutional Court outlawed the 
<br>RP in 1998, Erdogan and other RP members formed the 
<br>Islamic-oriented Virtue Party (FP).  When FP was banned in 
<br>2001 for unconstitutional anti-secular activities, Erdogan 
<br>split off from Erbakan and formed AKP with more pragmatic 
<br>members willing to work within the existing political system. 
<br> Erbakan and more hardcore Islamists formed Saadet (Felicity) 
<br>Party.  Erdogan moderated his rhetoric, making it easier for 
<br>voters to turn to AKP in the 2002 elections as an alternative 
<br>to traditional parties, mired in scandals, corruption and an 
<br>economic crisis.  AKP surged to power with 34 percent of the 
<br>vote, one of the largest parliamentary majorities in Turkey's 
<br>history. 
<br> 
<br>For the Defense 
<br>--------------- 
<br>¶3. (C)  Those who view AKP as reform-minded and democratic 
<br>are quick to cite AKP-backed reforms that strengthened 
<br>freedoms and democracy.  AKP legislation that reduced the 
<br>military's influence in the National Secuity Council (MGK) 
<br>and eliminated military membership in the security courts and 
<br>the Board of Higher Education (YOK), among others, improved 
<br>the civil-military equilibrium that had been heavily skewed 
<br>toward military control.  They cite as evidence of the 
<br>party's western-oriented, free market approach AKP's liberal 
<br>economic policies, which have stimulated the private sector, 
<br>increased foreign investment, reduced inflation and 
<br>stabilized the currency.  AKP supporters argue that Turkey's 
<br>traditional power centers (the military, judiciary, 
<br>bureacracy) feel threatened by EU-linked human rights and 
<br>rule of law reforms that enhance individual freedoms.  By 
<br>promoting EU membership, the AKP is slowly introducing more 
<br>balance into Turkey's strictly secular, statist society. 
<br>Supporters maintain that Erdogan's appointment of AKP 
<br>loyalists to influential positions previously held by 
<br>secularists has generated resentment against the AKP, further 
<br>fueled by the party's popularity.  They frame attacks against 
<br>the party as desperate measures by entrenched secularists who 
<br>fear that further democratization will undermine their 
<br>traditional control and the economic benefits they derived 
<br>from state intervention in the economy. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C)  Opponents charge that AKP only pushed a reform agenda 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000648  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>as far as necessary to convince the EU to begin accession 
<br>talks.  Even then, AKP focused on those reforms needed to 
<br>dilute the military's power rather than those that might 
<br>interfere with the party's Islamic agenda.  They note 
<br>Erdogan's support for greater freedom to express Islamic 
<br>practices (such as wearing the headscarf), and point to his 
<br>failure to allow Alevis, Kurds, Armenian and Greek Orthodox 
<br>communities similar freedoms.  Suspicious that the accession 
<br>process is just a cover for the AKP's anti-secular Islamic 
<br>agenda, some in the military and opposition are reconsidering 
<br>the merits of EU membership.  AKP officials admit reform 
<br>efforts have slowed, but explain that Turkey's bureaucracy 
<br>needs time to absorb and implement significant changes, such 
<br>as the complete overhaul of the Penal Code, Criminal 
<br>Procedure Code and Punishments Law passed between 2002 and 
<br>¶2004.  They also note that parliament passed in November 2006 
<br>much of another major reform package, including legislation 
<br>relating to minority foundations and schools, military 
<br>audits, military courts and political party funding.  In some 
<br>cases, parliament has had to re-approve the legislation to 
<br>overcome President Sezer's veto. 
<br> 
<br>Circumstantial Evidence 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>¶5. (C)  Conspiracy theorists and concerned secularists alike 
<br>build the case against AKP using persuasive but largely 
<br>circumstantial evidence.  Many claim that Erdogan has used 
<br>AKP's parliamentary majority to weaken Turkey's secular 
<br>educational, financial and judicial institutions.  They warn 
<br>that an AKP troika of president, PM and parliament speaker 
<br>would control the appointments process, transforming Turkey's 
<br>secular system into something approaching an Islamic 
<br>republic.  They point to AKP-sponsored changes in the 
<br>strictly secular education system to allow graduates of 
<br>religious high schools (imam hatip) to compete for limited 
<br>university seats and qualify for government jobs. 
<br>Previously, imam hatip, like other vocational school 
<br>graduates, advanced to the clergy or other appropriate 
<br>professions.  In addition, opponents charge that AKP has 
<br>undermined state regulation of private Koranic schools by 
<br>lifting age limits and extending hours of attendance.  As a 
<br>result, the number of Koranic schools has increased 
<br>significantly, with correspondingly less government 
<br>oversight. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Erdogan is also frequently accused of trying to 
<br>infiltrate the higher education system with Islamist-minded 
<br>professors and administrators.  After some university rectors 
<br>resisted AKP efforts to introduce more Islam into the 
<br>curriculum, AKP opponents claimed the government began a 
<br>harrassment campaign.  Police arrested one obstinate rector 
<br>in Van twice in 2006; both times he was reinstated by court 
<br>decision.  Legislation creating 15 new universities gave the 
<br>government authority to appoint the new rectors, rather than 
<br>the usual procedure of approvals by YOK and the president. 
<br>The law, pushed through over President Sezer's veto, is 
<br>viewed as an end-run to allow Erdogan to select 15 new 
<br>rectors of his mindset.  Parliament currently is considering 
<br>a proposal to establish another 17 new universities. 
<br> 
<br>Green Money Seeping In 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>¶7. (C)  While many acknowledge AKP economic successes, some 
<br>doubters flag the alleged influx of "green" money from 
<br>Islamic sources as proof of the real direction AKP is taking 
<br>Turkey's economy.  AKP opponents note that Islamist capital 
<br>is hard to track and question whether it is ultimately tied 
<br>to more Islamist policies.  Increased investments from the 
<br>UAE and a promised doubling of trade with Saudi Arabia after 
<br>the Saudi King's unprecedented 2006 visit raised suspicions 
<br>among some western-oriented investors.  The overall trend of 
<br>increased foreign investor inflows actually counters 
<br>insinuations of an Islamist take-over of Turkey's financial 
<br>sector, however.  Investments from Islamic sources pale in 
<br>comparison to total foreign inflows and do not seem to be of 
<br>economic or political significance. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Erdogan reputedly has manipulated the political 
<br>appointments process to place Islamist bankers in key 
<br>economic positions.  Along with Finance Minister Kemal 
<br>Unakitan - a former board member of one of Turkey's leading 
<br>Islamic banks (al-Baraka) - Erdogan's appointment of seven 
<br>other al-Baraka officials to key positions in Turkey's 
<br>Savings Deposit Insurance Fund is cited as support for an 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000648  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Islamist take-over theory.  In 2006, the PM virtually 
<br>paralyzed financial policy when he tried to appoint an 
<br>Islamist as head of the Central Bank against President 
<br>Sezer's firm opposition.  (The compromise candidate has 
<br>demonstrated independent decision-making since his 
<br>appointment.)  To round out the "damning" evidence, critics 
<br>cite FM Gul's background as a specialist at the Islamic 
<br>Development Bank in Jeddah from 1983 to 1991 and his reported 
<br>objections to state scrutiny of Islamic enterprises. 
<br> 
<br>Packing the Court 
<br>------------------ 
<br>¶9. (C) Erdogan is also accused of staging a take-over of the 
<br>judiciary.  The AKP pushed through legislation to lower the 
<br>mandatory retirement age for technocrats, opening the way for 
<br>Erdogan to name almost 4,000 of 9,000 judges and prosecutors. 
<br> In a stand-off with the judiciary, AKP has threatened to 
<br>refuse to implement high court rulings against the government 
<br>for obstructing AKP-sponsored legislation.  Similar struggles 
<br>between AKP and President Sezer have caused Sezer to veto 
<br>over 3,000 AKP appointments and send over 100 AKP-backed laws 
<br>to the Constitutional Court for review.  But for Sezer, 
<br>Erdogan would already be implementing his "secret" agenda, 
<br>worried secularists claim.  Economic reformers, including the 
<br>IMF, for their part, would be only too happy to see an 
<br>AKP-inspired change in the judiciary, which has consistently 
<br>blocked forward-looking economic reforms. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Erdogan rebutted the secularists' charges in 2006 by 
<br>noting that the AKP hadn't been in power long enough to 
<br>reshape the judiciary.  Rigid bureaucratic controls on 
<br>promotions and a 15-20 year career path for judges limit the 
<br>influence of any particular government on the judiciary's 
<br>orientation.  But critics note that Justice Ministry 
<br>budgetary control over the Supreme Council of Judges and 
<br>Prosecutors, which oversees assignments within the judiciary, 
<br>gives the AKP indirect influence that can have a long-term 
<br>impact.  The president appoints five of the seven council 
<br>members.  The Justice Minister, however, heads the council 
<br>and controls its funding, which could discourage council 
<br>members from voting against the Minister's proposed 
<br>appointees.  The most recent charge is that the Minister, by 
<br>not attending Supreme Council sessions, is preventing 29 
<br>judicial positions from being filled. 
<br> 
<br>Small Changes 
<br>-------------- 
<br>¶11. (C) AKP's strategy to infiltrate its Islamist agenda into 
<br>Turkey's secular institutions extends to the municipal level 
<br>and beyond, according to AKP opponents.  The party controls 
<br>four of Turkey's five largest cities (Ankara, Istanbul, Bursa 
<br>and Konya).  Measures by some AKP mayors to ban alcohol on 
<br>municipal property, establish women-only parks or equip 
<br>ferries with prayer rooms are seen as Islamic encroachments 
<br>on the secular system.  Erdogan and other party leaders 
<br>explained the alcohol restrictions as consistent with the 
<br>state's obligation to protect children from alcohol, drugs 
<br>and gambling, rather than a religious proscription. 
<br>Municipalities are authorized to ban the sale and consumption 
<br>of alcohol on municipal property and near schools, religious 
<br>sites and related locations.  Of the 62 provincial capitals 
<br>that have such a ban, 18 have non-AKP mayors.  Of the 19 
<br>without alcohol bans, 14 have AKP mayors.  As another 
<br>often-cited example of small but telling changes, critics 
<br>note that employees at the Health Ministry and state-owned 
<br>Turkish Airlines reported being questioned about their 
<br>religious beliefs and attitudes toward the Koran, an 
<br>unprecedented practice. 
<br> 
<br>Internal Balancing Act 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>¶12. (C) Erdogan has performed a delicate balancing act to 
<br>maintain unity within the AKP, despite the sometimes 
<br>conflicting interests of its competing factions.  Many party 
<br>faithful are pious; keeping their allegiance is central to 
<br>the AKP's hold on power but Erdogan has won them few tangible 
<br>successes.  He has not upheld earlier pledges to lift the ban 
<br>on headscarves in public buildings, though his strong 
<br>objections when the European Court of Human Rights upheld the 
<br>ban in public schools resonated with the party's more devout 
<br>members.  AKP's more conservation faction was disappointed by 
<br>the failed attempt to criminalize adultery in 2004. 
<br>Erdogan's attempts to put loyalists into government jobs can 
<br>also be viewed through the prism of rewarding the party 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00000648  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>faithful. 
<br> 
<br>The Jury Is Out 
<br>--------------- 
<br>¶12. (C)  Comment. To date, AKP critics can only muster 
<br>circumstantial evidence of an AKP Islamist agenda. 
<br>Opposition leaders, some media outlets, the military and 
<br>extreme nationalists have used this to play up fears that an 
<br>AKP triumvirate will allow Erdogan to make significant, 
<br>perhaps irreversible, changes that would undermine Turkey's 
<br>secular system.  Using dramatic ad campaigns and threatening 
<br>rhetoric, they warn that Turkey may soon have an Islamist 
<br>president with a head-scarf wearing wife ready to take the 
<br>country back to the pre-republic "dark ages".  President 
<br>Sezer, military leaders and the MGK chief have all warned 
<br>Erdogan against unconstitutional moves that might change 
<br>Turkey's secular identity.  The secular establishment's 
<br>concern that AKP poses a genuine threat to Turkey's secular 
<br>system is undoubtedly heightened by the realization that 
<br>AKP's reform agenda threatens the established elite's 
<br>traditional, top-down control. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C)  Those not convinced of a nefarious AKP plan contend 
<br>that more than four years in power have matured the party. 
<br>Erdogan has had to moderate his message to balance factions 
<br>within AKP and lessen tensions with secularists threatened by 
<br>AKP reforms.  Much of the party's success stems from its 
<br>image as being less corrupt ("AK" in Turkish means "clean", a 
<br>dubious claim for any party here) and more effective than the 
<br>opposition.  Its record to date describes a center-right, 
<br>conservative party with Islamic roots that has modestly 
<br>advanced Kemal Ataturk's core principles of westernization 
<br>and modernization.  Some of the changes tied to that process 
<br>will inevitably transform the traditional power balance and 
<br>strengthen civilian leaders.  To keep the public's trust and 
<br>minimize tension as Turkish society evolves, AKP, and Erdogan 
<br>in particular, will need to continue to employ 
<br>broad-reaching, moderate, balanced rhetoric.  End Comment.
