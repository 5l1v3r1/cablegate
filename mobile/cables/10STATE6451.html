<br>SUBJECT: (C)  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON TURKISH DEPUTY 
<br>PRIME MINISTER BULENT ARINC ASSASSINATION PLOT 
<br>(C-RE9-02710) 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: ELISSA G. PITTERLE, DIRECTOR, INR/OPS 
<br> 
<br> ¶1.  (SBU)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS ARE CLOSELY MONITORING 
<br>CIVIL/MILITARY TENSIONS IN TURKEY THAT HAVE BEEN BUILDING 
<br>DURING THE TWO-YEAR ERGENEKON INVESTIGATION.  TURKISH GENERAL 
<br>STAFF (TGS) CHIEF OF DEFENSE ILKER BASBUG, IN A 17 DECEMBER 
<br>SPEECH, WARNED THE GOVERNMENT, JOURNALISTS, AND JUDICIAL 
<br>OFFICIALS AGAINST PURSUING INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST SENIOR 
<br>OFFICERS. TWO DAYS LATER, POLICE DETAINED TWO MILITARY 
<br>OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE HOME OF DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER BULENT 
<br>ARINC, WHERE THEY WERE ENGAGED IN APPARENT SURVEILLANCE 
<br>ACTIVITIES, LEADING TO THE FIRST POLICE SEARCHES OF SPECIAL 
<br>FORCES OFFICES AND FURTHER DETENTIONS OF MILITARY OFFICERS. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (SBU)  WE WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE INFORMATION ON THIS 
<br>SURVEILLANCE, SUBSEQUENT POLICE SEARCHES, DETENTIONS OF 
<br>MILITARY OFFICERS, THE STATE OF MILITARY/POLICE AND 
<br>CIVIL/MILITARY RELATIONS, AND PERCEPTIONS OF THOSE 
<br>RELATIONSHIPS THAT POST CAN PROVIDE, AS TIME AND RESOURCES 
<br>PERMIT. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED FOR UPCOMING ANALYTICAL 
<br>PRODUCTION TO KEEP POLICYMAKERS ABREAST OF THE SITUATION. 
<br> 
<br>¶A.  (SBU)  WHY WAS ARINC BEING SURVEILLED? WHO AUTHORIZED 
<br>THIS SURVEILLANCE? WHO ELSE KNEW ABOUT IT? WHAT OR WHO TIPPED 
<br>OFF POLICE? DURING THE SEARCH WHAT WERE THEY LOOKING FOR AND 
<br>WHAT DID THEY FIND? WERE THE INVESTIGATORS LOOKING FOR 
<br>SPECIFIC EVIDENCE OR WAS IT A GENERAL SEARCH FOR INFORMATION? 
<br> HOW DO TURKISH LEADERS PERCEIVE THESE EVENTS? 
<br> 
<br>¶B.  (SBU)  WHAT IS THE STATE OF CIVIL/MILITARY RELATIONS? 
<br> 
<br>¶C.  (SBU)  WHAT IS THE STATE OF MILITARY/POLICE RELATIONS? 
<br>HAVE THESE ARRESTS CAUSED OR INCREASED TENSIONS BETWEEN 
<br>POLICE AND THE MILITARY? 
<br> 
<br>¶D.  (SBU)  DOES THE JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY, OR 
<br>ELEMENTS WITHIN IT, SEE THIS INCIDENT AS A MEANS TO FINALLY 
<br>"TAME" THE TGS OR DOES PRIME MINISTER TAYYIP ERDOGAN WISH TO 
<br>EASE FURTHER CONFRONTATION AND APPEASE THE TGS? 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (U)  PLEASE CITE C-RE9-02710 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
<br>REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
