<br>SUBJECT: EMBRAER'S CURADO -- ADVICE ON FX2 AND VIEWS ON THE 
<br>FINANCIAL CRISIS 
<br>
<br>REF: A. BRASILIA 73 
<br>¶B. SAOPAULO 31 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Consul General Thomas White; Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Sobel met with Embraer CEO 
<br>Federico Curado on January 30 to discuss Curado's views on 
<br>the FX2 sale, as well hear about how the financial crisis has 
<br>affected the company's sales. Curado stressed the political 
<br>nature of the decision, stating that in addition to 
<br>technology transfer, one of the primary goals of the Request 
<br>for Proposal (RFP) was job creation. He said this could be 
<br>achieved through a partnership between Boeing and Embraer in 
<br>the development of a next-generation Brazilian jet fighter. 
<br>Curado also suggested that the United States offer to 
<br>purchase a number of U.S.-assembled Embraer Super Tucanos in 
<br>exchange for the FX2 contract. He thought that tying 
<br>civilian aviation collaboration with the FX2 sale was too 
<br>complicated and too far off. Regarding the financial crisis, 
<br>he told Ambassador Sobel that Embraer has suffered 
<br>tremendously, and expects Embraer's production to fall 
<br>significantly after it works through its current backlog. 
<br>END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Curado emphasized the importance of the political 
<br>dimension of this decision. He said that even if Brazil 
<br>received full technology transfer, this would not achieve 
<br>what he sees as one of the principal goals of the program, 
<br>job creation. Curado explained that building a jet fighter 
<br>is a difficult process and that the only way to truly learn 
<br>how to build a plane is to develop the aircraft from the very 
<br>beginning. Not even technology transfer can accomplish this, 
<br>because "it is through trial and error that a company learns 
<br>how to actually build an aircraft." In Curado's view, the 
<br>GOB ultimately wants to create jobs from this sale and to do 
<br>so, they need a partner who can work with Embraer to develop 
<br>a next-generation aircraft in Brazil. Embraer would like 
<br>Boeing to be that partner. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Embraer proposed matching the sale of the F-18s with 
<br>a comparable purchase of Embraer Super Tucanos, assembled at 
<br>the Embraer facility in Florida. Curado cited this as a 
<br>creative way to add value to the Boeing bid. 
<br>This promise would, in his view, be a convincing step in the 
<br>GOB's decision. Curado then stated that Embraer privately 
<br>hopes Boeing wins the contract, though publicly they must 
<br>remain neutral. He finally asked Ambassador Sobel to avoid 
<br>discussions of civilian aviation collaboration, which he said 
<br>could confuse the selection process for the FX2. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) According to Curado, the financial crisis has brought 
<br>Embraer's new sales to zero. They are working through a 
<br>backlog of planes, but in two to three years, Curado expects 
<br>to have completed the backlog, leaving Embraer with no planes 
<br>to produce. He told Ambassador Sobel that he expects the 
<br>crisis to have abated in three to four years, though he 
<br>foresees further depreciation of assets worldwide. He said 
<br>that some clients have canceled contracts, despite losing 
<br>deposits as high as 40 percent of the value of the plane. 
<br>NOTE: This differs from Curado's public statements that do 
<br>not paint such a bleak picture. In fact, Curado told a 
<br>visiting Codel on January 29 that sales remain strong for 
<br>certain classes of aircraft and that few of their clients 
<br>have canceled orders. END NOTE. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) COMMENT: Defense officials have told the Mission 
<br>that creation of a domestic arms industry is an essential 
<br>part of the bidding process (REF A). The head of the 
<br>Brazilian Air Force has said that he prefers the F-18, and 
<br>most experts believe it to be technologically superior (REF 
<br>B). Curado concurred that both technology transfer and job 
<br>creation are key aspects of the RFP. As it stands, the RFP 
<br>calls for a relatively small number of planes (36), and 
<br>Boeing officials have told Embraer that it is not economical 
<br>
<br>SAO PAULO 00000104 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>to assemble or manufacture F-18s in Brazil. This fact would 
<br>not allow for the creation of significant numbers of jobs in 
<br>Brazil, something that Curado and Embraer see as key to 
<br>winning the contract. However, if Boeing and Embraer were to 
<br>partner in the development of a Brazilian next-generation jet 
<br>fighter, the technology transfer and job creation concerns 
<br>would be addressed, and potentially make Boeing's bid for the 
<br>FX2 more likely to succeed. END COMMENT. 
<br>

<br>and Ambassador Sobel.
