<br>
<br>Classified By: POL M/C Joseph Y. Yun. Reasons 1.4(b/d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The DPRK's recent restaffing and expansion of 
<br>the National Defense Commission (NDC) and its hostile 
<br>military rhetoric over the last several months are related to 
<br>the DPRK leadership's "top priority" need to stabilize the 
<br>DPRK internally in preparation for succession, according to 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  A second priority was to achieve improved
<br>Relations with the United States, which the DPRK regards as its only
<br>potential  security guarantor, ironically. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>Military Statements and the NDC 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In an April 23 meeting, XXXXXXXXXXXX told Poloff that the 
<br>Korean People's Army's (KPA) spate of high-level 
<br>announcements over the past several months (such as the March 
<br>8 KPA Supreme Command report, the first in 15 years, and the 
<br>four KPA General Staff statements since January, not seen 
<br>since 1999) should not be misinterpreted as the DPRK military 
<br>asserting control over the country, because the military 
<br>could act only in concert with the Worker's Party and the 
<br>Cabinet. Instead the "generals appearing on TV" was a 
<br>phenomenon directed at DPRK citizens with two goals: to show 
<br>that the DPRK's hostile external situation meant citizens had 
<br>to pull together, and as a "power display" to send a 
<br>law-and-order message to counter the increasing economic 
<br>disorder resulting from decades of economic "depression." 
<br>There was dissatisfaction among some elite groups in the 
<br>DPRK, who knew of economic reform in China and Vietnam and 
<br>wondered why the DPRK had instead deteriorated. To tamp down 
<br>this internal dissent, external tension was needed. The ROKG 
<br>was not particularly worried about the specific threats to 
<br>the South contained in the statements because they saw the 
<br>statements as targeted at the domestic audience, and in any 
<br>case knew the DPRK would try to achieve surprise if it were 
<br>to resort to military action, rather than giving warning. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The key factor in the background was 67-year-old Kim 
<br>Jong-il's (KJI) waning health. After KJI's August 2008 
<br>stroke, the DPRK was a "different environment that needed 
<br>stronger leadership." XXXXXXXXXXXX said that before the stroke, KJI 
<br>was confident that he could rule for years, but afterward he 
<br>suffered "physical and psychological trauma." KJI had become 
<br>obsessed with creating political stability to allow an 
<br>orderly succession, though XXXXXXXXXXXX did not claim to know who was 
<br>next in line. Immediately after the April 5 missile launch 
<br>the Supreme People's Assembly had declared the beginning of 
<br>KJI's third ruling period. But rather than celebrating the 
<br>renewal of his mandate, KJI was concentrating on changes that 
<br>would pave the way for succession. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The most important of these was the enlargement (from 
<br>8 to 13 members) and strengthening of the KJI-chaired 
<br>National Defense Commission (NDC). The NDC was first 
<br>established in 1998 with a largely symbolic role, but had 
<br>since taken on policy and coordination functions. Now it had 
<br>the lead on succession, XXXXXXXXXXXX believed. KJI brother-in-law 
<br>Chang Song-taek's addition to the NDC was important for 
<br>succession preparation, not only because he was married to 
<br>KJI's only sibling and close confidante 63-year-old Kim 
<br>Kyong-hui, but also because Chang was seen as having 
<br>effectively protected and acted for KJI during KJI's fall 
<br>2008 recovery period. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Another key change was the replacement of National 
<br>Defense Commission Deputy Chairman Kim Yong-chun with Oh 
<br>Kuk-ryul, a 78-year old Kim-family loyalist (in relative 
<br>terms, since all senior officials are loyalists) who XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>thought was consolidating various ROK-surveillance and 
<br>special operations institutions under his control at NDC. 
<br>One of these was the Worker's Party's Operations Department, 
<br>which Oh has headed since 1989. (XXXXXXXXXXXX also referred to an 
<br>April 21 JoongAng Ilbo newspaper article claiming that 
<br>"Office 35," charged with intel collection, and the "External 
<br>Liaison Office," charged with training agents, had both been 
<br>moved from the Operations Department to NDC/KPA control, 
<br>saying that ROK intel sources did not think there was 
<br>
<br>evidence of such a move.) The Operations Department, which 
<br>formulates actions against the South, was "passive" during 
<br>the 1999-2007 Sunshine Policy period, but was now becoming 
<br>more active again. In other words, Oh's job was to keep the 
<br>South off balance and make sure that it did not disrupt the 
<br>succession period. XXXXXXXXXXXX said he believed that changes to the 
<br>DPRK constitution, announced but not yet explained, would 
<br>also focus on succession-related issues. He alluded to 
<br>frequent DPRK propaganda aiming for the establishment of a 
<br>"strong and prosperous" nation by 2012, saying that DPRK 
<br>authorities believed they had already succeeded ideologically 
<br>and militarily, so they were concentrating on the economic 
<br>side, which is where the Kaesong Industrial Complex fit in. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The DPRK's determination to maintain internal order 
<br>meant that it could go so far as to engage in "limited armed 
<br>conflict" with the ROK. At the same time, the DPRK was well 
<br>aware that ROK forces were ready for any provocation and 
<br>would respond with superior force. In addition, the DPRK 
<br>knew that combined ROK-U.S. surveillance capabilities would 
<br>prevent it from achieving surprise, so XXXXXXXXXXXX was reassured that 
<br>no direct military provocation was imminent. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>Relations with the U.S. 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Asked what the ROKG's policy options were, given the 
<br>above situation, XXXXXXXXXXXX answered indirectly, saying that the 
<br>main question was U.S.-DPRK relations. Second only to 
<br>maintaining internal stability to allow for succession was 
<br>the DPRK's determination to improve relations with the U.S., 
<br>because only the U.S. could solve both the DPRK's security 
<br>and economic problems. XXXXXXXXXXXX said this push for improved 
<br>relations was ironic, given DPRK rhetoric attacking the U.S. 
<br>as a menace, but was nevertheless high on DPRK authorities' 
<br>agenda. XXXXXXXXXXXX said the DPRK saw the 1999-2000 rapprochement 
<br>with the Clinton Administration as the first, failed, chance 
<br>for peace with the U.S.; that the Bush (43) Administration 
<br>had turned to negotiations too late for substantial progress; 
<br>and that the Obama Administration amounted to a "second 
<br>chance." The DPRK craved a dialogue with the U.S., aiming 
<br>for a "big deal," but first needed to raise tensions to 
<br>create the need for dialogue. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The scope for inter-Korean relations depended on what 
<br>happened with U.S.-DPRK relations. XXXXXXXXXXXX was convinced that 
<br>the DPRK would keep tension high towards the South, while 
<br>seeking an opening with the U.S. Therefore, his 
<br>recommendation to ROK policymakers was to stay on an even 
<br>keel to keep the South-North situation from deteriorating 
<br>further. The DPRK's April 21 proposal for dialogue about 
<br>land-use and wages at the Kaesong Industrial Complex was 
<br>potentially helpful in that regard, but had to be approached 
<br>carefully, because the DPRK would try to seize the initiative 
<br>and lock-in economic benefits without offering reciprocal 
<br>steps. Like other ROKG officials, XXXXXXXXXXXX emphasized the need 
<br>for continued close U.S.-ROK coordination on all issues 
<br>related to North Korea. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX cautioned that China would seek to prevent 
<br>U.S.-DPRK relations from improving too much, adding with a 
<br>smile that had it not been for its attitude toward the U.S., 
<br>China would have moved to prevent the October 2006 DPRK 
<br>nuclear weapon test. 
<br>

<br>Mt. Kumgang 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) As an aside, XXXXXXXXXXXX commented on the July 2008 shooting 
<br>death of a South Korean tourist at Mt. Kumgang. He said that 
<br>KPA soldiers and sentries in the area, after frequent contact 
<br>with South Korean tourists, had a tendency to be too relaxed, 
<br>so KPA officers periodically conducted exercises to tighten 
<br>discipline. The shooting had occurred during one of those 
<br>exercise periods.
