<br>¶C. (C) PARIS 7527 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Pol/MC Josiah Rosenblatt for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: The perpetrators of the urban rampaging 
<br>(refs) in France are by and large of Arab-African and 
<br>Black-African background. In most cases, they are also 
<br>Muslims, raising the question as to what extent their 
<br>religious affiliation helps explain the explosion in France's 
<br>immigrant suburbs. There is widespread agreement that 
<br>unemployment and lack of education, and not religious 
<br>affiliation, are the primary factors underlying the angry 
<br>hopelessness of urban youth. That said, responsible 
<br>commentators on the situation -- from officials who monitor 
<br>potential support for terrorist activities to rights 
<br>activists with long experience working in troubled 
<br>neighborhoods -- see religious affiliation as a complicating 
<br>factor. Thus far most of the youths in question, while 
<br>happening to be Muslim by culture, are generally not viewed 
<br>as individually inspired by Islam, just as Islamic political 
<br>groupings are generally not viewed as being directly behind 
<br>the violence. Observers note, however, that these groups 
<br>have not hesitated to try to exploit the unrest for their own 
<br>purposes, just as extremist and nativist politicians on the 
<br>far-right have played to racism and xenophobic fears. The 
<br>government's decision to turn to Muslim leaders to quell the 
<br>unrest is itself seen by some as misdirected and a bad 
<br>precedent, in contradiction with the French republic's strict 
<br>secularism. In sum, while efforts to politicize the unrest 
<br>are seen as unsuccessful to date, there is concern that not 
<br>"getting it right" in dealing with the problems of France's 
<br>underclass Muslims could eventually produce the very Islamic 
<br>extremism identity that (almost) no one wants. End summary. 
<br>
<br>No direct links to Islamic extremism 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Though it has carefully watched for it, the French 
<br>Government has not discerned any significant link between 
<br>Islamic extremism and the recent unrest. As Christophe 
<br>Chaboud, head of the Ministry of Interior's counter-terrorism 
<br>coordination body (known by its French acronym - UCLAT), 
<br>categorically reconfirmed to PolOff on November 15, "we (the 
<br>GoF) have not found any link between Islamic extremists and 
<br>those fomenting the unrest. He acknowledged that police and 
<br>internal intelligence organizations have received "a few" 
<br>signs that some Islamic extremists have participated in the 
<br>violence. That said, he believed that they were acting as 
<br>individuals and not as members of a coordinated, Islamic 
<br>group. 
<br>
<br>Fears of extremist and criminal exploitation 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Chaboud reported that GoF monitoring of websites and 
<br>blogs (in France and abroad) nonetheless reveals that 
<br>extremists are trying to exploit the unrest to their 
<br>advantage, claiming (for example) that it results from GOF 
<br>attempts to control and muzzle Islam in France. Asked 
<br>whether there was any connection between organized criminal 
<br>gangs and Islamic extremists in exploiting the unrest, 
<br>Chaboud said those in the "revolt movement" were, at most, 
<br>only petty criminals. Indeed, police are quoted in press as 
<br>observing that where organized crime is strongest is often 
<br>where there has been, counter to conventional expectations, 
<br>little unrest, presumably because drug-selling organizations 
<br>view burning cars as bad for business. (See also ref C for 
<br>the views of a investigating judge on the connection between 
<br>criminality and current unrest.) 
<br>
<br>Just hoodlums? 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Samira Cadasse, vice-president of a leading women's 
<br>rights group that focuses on empowering women in poor 
<br>immigrant communities, told PolOff that the small groups of 
<br>youths responsible for car burnings and police taunting are 
<br>the same ones who "hold hostage" suburban housing projects 
<br>throughout France. Cadasse's NGO -- "Ni Putes Ni Soumises 
<br>(NPNS -- translated literally as "Neither Whores nor 
<br>Submissives") focuses on the difficulties poor, often Muslim 
<br>women of immigrant background face in resisting 
<br>discrimination from French society as well as oppression 
<br>within their own cultural traditions. Cadasse said NPNS has 
<br>tried to highlight for years the way frustrated, angry, 
<br>aimless young men in poor neighborhoods, under the blind eye 
<br>of French authorities, visit their powerlessness first and 
<br>foremost on their female relatives. 
<br>Or "Islamic" hoodlums? 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Contrary to much of the media reporting, Cadasse 
<br>said she definitely also perceived an Islamist element behind 
<br>some of the violence. Exclaiming that, "we all know who 
<br>these guys are," she claimed they had shaved their (Islamic) 
<br>beards in order to spread violence. These unemployed 
<br>Islamist youths were the same troublemakers who had sought to 
<br>repress women in the troubled suburban neighborhoods. She 
<br>also believed it significant that there were no girls among 
<br>the troublemakers. That said, while Cadasse clearly believed 
<br>that the misapplication of tenets some attribute to Islam 
<br>abets the widespread oppression of women in these immigrant 
<br>communities, she stopped well short of calling the "big 
<br>brothers" committed Islamist fundamentalists. 
<br>
<br>No role models or jobs 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Cadasse identified lack of jobs as the real root of 
<br>the problem, which was compounded by the relative generosity 
<br>of the social safety net. As a result, young men sat idle at 
<br>home, while receiving a generous -- but ultimately 
<br>insufficient and humiliating -- 950-euro stipend from the 
<br>government. They could not afford to move away from their 
<br>parents, but at the same time accepted no parental control. 
<br>She did not think it accurate to portray these youths as 
<br>victims; these young men were guilty of arson and other 
<br>crimes and should be punished. At the same time, she thought 
<br>it would be difficult to break the vicious cycle. Cadasse 
<br>saw the current crisis -- due to larger failures and 
<br>shortfalls in education, employment opportunities and housing 
<br>-- as very difficult to resolve, and doubted that the 
<br>government had the will do go beyond the "Band-Aid" solutions 
<br>employed in the past. 
<br>
<br>30 years of "ghettoization" 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) According to Cadasse, the government's history of 
<br>treating only the symptoms rather than the causes of minority 
<br>unemployment and social exclusion, and its failure to curb a 
<br>thirty-year ghettoization trend among French immigrant 
<br>communities, "has been an error" of governments of both left 
<br>and right. Cadasse was pessimistic about the prospects of 
<br>bettering the circumstances of France's immigrants of Arab 
<br>background. She said that overall, "we're no better off than 
<br>22 years ago" -- at the time of the "march of the beurs" -- a 
<br>turning point in North African immigrant activism. While she 
<br>did not envision a "Marshall plan" for France's 
<br>inner-city-like suburbs, she believed that "drastic measures" 
<br>were necessary nonetheless. PM de Villepin's pledge to 
<br>reverse the budget cuts to associations (like NPNS) and to 
<br>offer a range of other social program enhancements was a 
<br>positive start. Government funding was also critical for 
<br>secular NGOs like NPNS to combat the influence of Islamists. 
<br>But she doubted the government had the will to stay the 
<br>course. In her view, it was too tempting for the government 
<br>to focus on security in an attempt to appeal to 
<br>far-right-leaning voters in the upcoming presidential 
<br>election. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Comment: French NGOs are largely dependent on 
<br>government support, and typically receive 80 percent or more 
<br>of their funding from the state. These associations are 
<br>essential to holding together the social fabric of poor 
<br>neighborhoods, providing everything from food kitchens to 
<br>tutoring to psychological support activities. Soon after 
<br>President Chirac's re-election in 2002, the state financing 
<br>of these associations was cut severely. Prime Minister 
<br>Villepin last week promised to restore the cuts. The 
<br>government appears to understand that diminishing the 
<br>viability of these secular, state-funded charitable 
<br>organization risks a vacuum that could be filled by home 
<br>grown, Islamist self-help organizations. End Comment. 
<br>
<br>GOF guilty of using religion? 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Interestingly, some see the government itself as 
<br>guilty to some degree of having violated the principle of 
<br>secularism it holds so dear. In a meeting with the rector of 
<br>the Grand Mosque of Lyon on November 15, one Muslim religious 
<br>leader's criticized the government for violating France's 
<br>strict separation of the religious and the public. The 
<br>Rector, Kamel Kabtane, took to task the government's effort 
<br>to use Muslim religious figures to calm the situation in 
<br>troubled neighborhoods. Kabtane said that many of his 
<br>fellow-clerics were also ambivalent about the French 
<br>government's call on religious leaders to "do the work of the 
<br>government and security forces." "If farmers started 
<br>protesting", said the Rector, "the government wouldn't call 
<br>on the Archbishop to resolve the situation." He warned 
<br>against attributing a religious dimension to socio-economic 
<br>problems; there was a risk it could become a self-fulfilling 
<br>prophecy. 
<br>
<br>Better ecumenical than Muslim-only 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Kabtane went on to point out that, "the government 
<br>says that France is a secular state, but then -- when it 
<br>serves its purposes to do so -- it turns around and calls on 
<br>religious leaders to solve non-religious problems that the 
<br>secular state should have been addressing over the last 20-30 
<br>years." Kabtane has not issued a statement condemning the 
<br>violence or calling upon the perpetrators to stop, as he 
<br>believes it is important not to conflate the actions of 
<br>violent youths with Islam. If religious leaders are to be 
<br>involved, he believes it would be preferable to adopt an 
<br>ecumenical rather than a sectarian approach. To that end, he 
<br>was organizing a meeting of religious leaders from the 
<br>Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities in Lyon on November 
<br>¶16. His aim was to convince those present to issue a joint 
<br>statement condemning the violence and calling for it to end. 
<br>
<br>The risk of an anti-Muslim backlash 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Kabtane indicated that he was much more worried 
<br>about backlash against Muslims following on the recent unrest 
<br>than about any putative use of the unrest by fundamentalists. 
<br>On November 12, a Molotov cocktail was thrown over the wall 
<br>into the Grand Mosque of Lyon. Then on November 13, someone 
<br>threw a Molotov cocktail over the wall of a mosque in 
<br>Saint-Chamond (a town near Lyon). Kabtane said that Muslims 
<br>were paying the price for the fact that French politicians -- 
<br>and foreign media -- have blamed the violence on "Muslims" 
<br>and "immigrants" instead of on "unemployed" or 
<br>"underprivileged" youths. (Comment: We have now heard 
<br>reports of a handful of such attacks against mosques. In all 
<br>likelihood, they were perpetrated by right-wing, 
<br>anti-immigrant nativists. End Comment.) Kabtane added that 
<br>he was satisfied with the demonstrations of support he had 
<br>received from French authorities in the wake of the attack on 
<br>the mosque. The local prefect visited the site the following 
<br>morning, and Interior Minister Sarkozy had telephoned Kabtane 
<br>to offer support. 
<br>
<br>The French school system as the key 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) During a public affairs talk show on the evening 
<br>of November 13, conservative philosopher Alain Finkelkraut 
<br>addressed how "the Republic" could reclaim the troubled, 
<br>inner-city-like neighborhoods "lost" to both law and order 
<br>and social integration. Finkelkraut poetically evoked his 
<br>experience in France's public school system, stressing its 
<br>role in separating youths from surrounding society in order 
<br>better to inculcate the values that underpin the "Republican 
<br>ideal" of equal citizenship blind to race, nationality, 
<br>religion and social class. Finkelkraut lamented the way 
<br>"society had invaded the schools," bringing with it a raft of 
<br>demands, identities, exceptions and resentments that, taken 
<br>together, interfered with the inculcation of a shared 
<br>national identity. In Finkelkraut's view, taking back the 
<br>neighborhoods for "Republican" law and order was the lesser 
<br>half of the battle. Providing, to those most removed from 
<br>the possibility of it, the convictions and opportunities 
<br>required for successfully integrating into French society was 
<br>the more difficult, and most urgent challenge, facing France 
<br>today. 
<br>
<br>Otherwise sectarianism could follow 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Finkelkraut warned that failure to meet this 
<br>challenge would inevitably open the door to the ascendancy of 
<br>separate, alternative identities focused on religion. 
<br>Controversial Islamic activist Tarik Ramadan, who also 
<br>participated in the round-table discussion, indirectly 
<br>confirmed as much. Turning around the image of "the Republic 
<br>needing to take back the neighborhoods", Ramadan, unctuously, 
<br>but deftly, argued for the right of "the neighborhoods" -- 
<br>their cultures, identities, religion, etc. -- to "take the 
<br>Republic." 
<br>
<br>The French fear of "communitarism" 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Former Prime Minister Alain Juppe -- spending a 
<br>semester teaching in Canada -- posted a long piece to his 
<br>blog (www.al1jup.com) that clearly identified "Islam in 
<br>France," specifically "radical Islam," as a factor also 
<br>"responsible" for the current unrest. In Juppe's view, 
<br>"French Islam's" refusal -- so far -- to "solemnly proclaim" 
<br>its acceptance of the "separation of the temporal from the 
<br>spiritual" and its recognition of "non-negotiable, universal 
<br>human rights" (including gender equality) contributes to the 
<br>difficulty of integrating those who live in the neighborhoods 
<br>where radical Islam presents itself as an alternative model 
<br>for social organization. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶15. (SBU) The gangs of underclass youths who are the 
<br>perpetrators of the car burnings and urban violence in France 
<br>are not Islamists, nor are they at all motivated by religion. 
<br>It is highly misleading to characterize them -- as is often 
<br>done in media coverage -- as "insurgent" and "Muslim" youths. 
<br>The anger felt by these youths stems from how they are 
<br>trapped and without a future -- facing pervasive racial 
<br>prejudice, and without the skills and education needed to 
<br>get-a-life of employment and conventional respect. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU) That said, the dominant religion in France's 
<br>low-income housing projects affected by the recent violence 
<br>is Islam, and there are those intent on "saving" these 
<br>communities from their social ills by re-founding them on 
<br>religious, as opposed to secular, principles, in effect 
<br>filling the vacuum where French republican values have failed 
<br>to take root. Whether or not Islamic organizations and 
<br>fundamentalist proselytizing will make significant inroads 
<br>among the inhabitants of France's immigrant suburbs of course 
<br>depends on the effectiveness of the GOF's social programs and 
<br>the willingness of French society at large to face up to its 
<br>pervasive prejudices against Blacks and Arabs.
