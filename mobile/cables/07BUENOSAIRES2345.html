<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The GOA has repeatedly suspended Ministerial-level
<br>contacts and has cut off some law enforcement contacts with
<br>the USG in wake of the continuing furor (ref a) over DOJ
<br>allegations that $800,000 intercepted August 4 by Argentine
<br>officials was a BRV cash contribution for Cristina Kirchner's
<br>(CFK) presidential campaign. The press reports that the GOA
<br>is considering further responses, including the staging of a
<br>massive protest in front of the Embassy which could involve
<br>radical and sometimes violent groups. The Argentine Deputy
<br>Foreign Minister advised the Ambassador that he would be
<br>called in to the MFA on December 18. The Ambassador used a
<br>previously scheduled holiday reception for more than 100
<br>journalists to roll out Washington-cleared guidance
<br>reinforcing the message that the recent arrests in Miami do
<br>not constitute a U.S. conspiracy against the GOA and that the
<br>United States wants a good relationship with Argentina. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>GOA Ire Against USG Dominates Headlines
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Argentine media on December 14 continued to give
<br>extensive coverage to the GOA's furious reaction (ref a) to
<br>FBI allegations that $800,000 intercepted August 4 by
<br>Argentine officials was a BRV cash contribution for Cristina
<br>Kirchner's (CFK) presidential campaign. According to several
<br>sources, CFK was very angry and upset, interpreting U.S.
<br>arrests and charges as rejection of her overtures for better
<br>relations, an attempt to destabilize
<br>her new administration, and an effort to force her to
<br>distance Argentina from Venezuela. Following the lead of
<br>President Kirchner, her chief of staff and Justice Minister
<br>-- whose remarks (ref a) were broadcast and re-broadcast
<br>throughout the day and night -- a broad array of CFK's
<br>congressional, gubernatorial, and mayoral allies have accused
<br>the USG of slandering CFK and the GOA in premeditated fashion
<br>in its effort to get Chavez.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Opposition leader and presidential candidate Elisa
<br>Carrio, who finished the October 28 polling in second place,
<br>ridiculed the GOA's attempt to portray the arrests as part of
<br>an anti-CFK conspiracy. "President Kirchner does not seem to
<br>understand that the justice system in the U.S. is autonomous.
<br>Thank God, (CFK) cannot stop the U.S. justice system. I am
<br>happy that the Americans are investigating, because they're
<br>the best guarantee (of an
<br>impartial inestigation). Not even the U.S. president can
<br>intervene." Leaders of other opposition parties questioned
<br>CFK's ties to Caracas and criticized the GOA for having let
<br>Antonini-Wilson leave the country before completing its own
<br>investigation.
<br>
<br>GOA Gives the USG the Silent Treatment
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) The press is further reporting that cabinet
<br>ministers have been instructed not to meet with the
<br>Ambassador, and that all U.S. requests for high-level
<br>meetings with GOA officials must be coordinated through the
<br>MFA. We are also hearing from our law enforcement contacts
<br>that they are being instructed by the GOA leadership to
<br>minimize contacts with us. Several bilateral meetings were
<br>cancelled under instruction on December 13. The Airport
<br>Security Police told Embassy they had been instructed not to
<br>meet with U.S. officials. On the afternoon of December 14,
<br>the GOA ended more than 24 hours of shunning contacts with
<br>the Embassy when Deputy Foreign Minister Garcia Moritan
<br>called the Ambassador. He advised the Ambassador that he
<br>should come to the MFA to meet Foreign Minister Taiana on the
<br>evening of December 18. We anticipate this will entail a
<br>protest and an explanation of the steps the GOA plans to
<br>undertake.
<br>
<br>
<br>GOA-Organized Anti-USG Protest in the Offing?
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) "La Nacion," the newspaper of record, and other
<br>media have reported that CFK and her top advisers repeatedly
<br>huddled Wednesday night and Thursday morning on how to deal
<br>with "the worst moment of the bilateral relationship with the
<br>United States" in the last four and a half years. According
<br>to "La Nacion," "the Casa Rosada (presidential palace)
<br>Thursday considered ordering mayors, social organizations,
<br>and activists ("piqueteros") to organize a mass demonstration
<br>of protest in front of the U.S. embassy." The article quotes
<br>an unnamed official at Casa Rosada who said, "We have not
<br>ruled it out. There is a great deal of anger with the United
<br>States, but it has not yet been decided." (Mission ARSO sent
<br>a report on this development and Mission counter-measures to
<br>DS Command Center -- ref b.)
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The press reported remarks by WHA A/S Shannon that
<br>the case was a law enforcement matter, not a political issue,
<br>and that it should not be allowed to affect bilateral
<br>relations. The press also quoted Department spokesman
<br>McCormack on the strength of the bilateral relationship and
<br>the independence of federal prosecutors, as well as similar
<br>statements by the Embassy's spokesperson.
<br>
<br>The Empire Strikes Back: Mission PD Response
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) The Ambassador used a previously scheduled holiday
<br>reception for more than 100 print, radio, and TV journalists
<br>December 14 to roll out Washington-cleared guidance on the
<br>case. Several of the radio journalists used their cell
<br>phones to transmit the Ambassador's words on the air through
<br>their stations, and many rushed out after the Ambassador
<br>concluded to call in stories. Several stories reporting on
<br>the Ambassador's reception remarks have already hit the
<br>wires. We expect that the Ambassador's remarks will dominate
<br>Argentine headlines Saturday.
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) We also gave the journalists recent quotes by
<br>Assistant Secretary Shannon, Secretary Chao, Dana Perino, and
<br>the Ambassador on the U.S.-Argentine relationship. We are
<br>posting the Ambassador's remarks on the Mission's web page.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) What began as a black day for the U.S. image in
<br>Argentina -- with headlines filled with attacks by CFK and
<br>others about our supposedly dark intentions -- is ending on a
<br>more hopeful note, as the quick work by State, Justice, and
<br>the FBI to review and clear our draft guidance on the issue
<br>enabled us to get our story out to a captive group of
<br>Argentine journalists. As the first week of the CFK
<br>administration draws to a close, we have given pragmatists
<br>within the GOA material to work with in their effort to
<br>convince CFK to climb back from the precipice and re-engage
<br>with the USG as she begins the second week of her
<br>presidential term. We will see their reaction and response
<br>in the days ahead.
