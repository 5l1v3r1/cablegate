<br>TAGS: PGOV PREL MARR NATO FR RS
<br>SUBJECT: FRENCH MISTRAL SALE TO RUSSIA RAISED AT NATO
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Ivo Daalder for reasons 1.4 (b/d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Lithuania's NATO PermRep Linkevicius raised France's
<br>potential sale to Russia of a Mistral class ship during a
<br>February 9 PermReps' lunch, noting that the sale was not
<br>simply a national issue but a subject for discussion within
<br>the Alliance.  French PermRep Andreani did not respond.
<br>However, the following day, the February 10 NAC meeting,
<br>Andreani made a point of highlighting France's commitment to
<br>Baltic security by reporting that France had been
<br>participating since January 4 in Baltic air policing.  She
<br>cited this as evidence of France's commitment to the
<br>collective defense of the Baltics.  The French Political
<br>Counselor told us afterward that he was waiting for guidance
<br>from Paris on the Mistral sale as the French Mission here had
<br>not previously been involved in this issue.  On February 11,
<br>Estonian PermRep Luik complained about the sale over lunch
<br>with Ambassador Daalder, noting that inclusion of Allied
<br>equipment could trigger third county transfer rules - in
<br>particular the case of Canadian technology.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) NATO Spokesman James Appathurai was asked about the
<br>sale during a February 10 press conference, in light of
<br>Russia's newly released military doctrine that identifies
<br>NATO enlargement as a key threat.  Appathurai noted that,
<br>while Secretary-General Rasmussen recognized the concerns of
<br>some Allies over the sale were real and understandable for
<br>historic and geographic reasons, Rasmussen had told Russian
<br>Foreign Minister Lavrov that he did not view Russia as a
<br>threat and hoped Russians did not see NATO as a threat.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Comment:  The Mistral sale had not been a topic of
<br>debate at NATO prior to the Lithuanian-French exchange.
<br>Several Allies have been reluctant to raise an Ally's
<br>bilateral arms sales at NATO, even if they preferred that
<br>France not sell the ship to Russia.  In the past, discussion
<br>of bilateral arms sales have traditionally not been seen as
<br>an appropriate topic at NATO.  Given the significance of the
<br>potential Mistral sale and broader discussions on reassurance
<br>and NATO's relations with Russia, the Mistral may be viewed
<br>as an exception in light of some Allies' concerns regarding
<br>Russia's military capabilities and intentions, and possible
<br>third party transfer rules.  End Comment.
