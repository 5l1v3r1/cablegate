<br>SUBJECT: DCM'S MEETING WITH MFA STATE SECRETARY BERNARDINO
<br>LEON
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 89241
<br>
<br>Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR KATHLEEN M. FITZPATRICK FOR REASONS
<br>1.4 (B) and (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) DCM paid an initial call May 10 on MFA State
<br>Secretary Bernadino Leon, who said this was his first meeting
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>with a foreign embassy since taking office. Leon made a
<br>point of saying that the new government wanted to have
<br>excellent relations with the U.S., especially on
<br>counter-terrorism in light of March 11. He said Spain likely
<br>would increase its Euro corps presence in Afghanistan and he
<br>expressed optimism that Spain would agree to a Provincial
<br>Reconstruction Team (PRT) (but said the decision was still
<br>pending at MOD). DCM mentioned our desire for 500-800 more
<br>troops; Leon demurred on numbers, saying likely would not be
<br>that high, and the exact count had not yet been determined.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Leon also said Spain was considering sending a
<br>Guardia Civil/police contingent to Haiti to help train the
<br>police and contribute to democratization there. He said MFA
<br>felt that would be Spain's most useful contribution, rather
<br>than peacekeeping forces. He also offered Spain's help on
<br>economic issues in the lead up to the US-EU summit.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) DCM noted our desire, now that we have expressed our
<br>disappointment on the Iraq troop withdrawal decision, to move
<br>forward to continue our excellent relations with Spain under
<br>the new government. DCM said U.S. would welcome support in
<br>the EU on counter-terrorism issues such as Passenger Name
<br>recognition and terrorist financing. DCM also noted that he
<br>thought that positive steps on Afghanistan, along the lines
<br>Leon foreshadowed, would likely be very well received in
<br>Washington.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Noting that Iran was another area of cooperation
<br>between the US and Spain, with Spain chair of the IAEA board
<br>of governors, DCM said our experts on Iran were ready and
<br>willing to come to Madrid to brief the new government. Leon
<br>said Zapatero specifically wanted to maintain the good ties
<br>that Aznar had with Khattami, saying that Spain could be
<br>useful in this regard.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) On Iraq/UNSC resolution, Leon reconfirmed that Spain
<br>was not pursuing a parallel draft with France and Germany,
<br>but noted Spain could be helpful with these two countries as
<br>discussion progressed, as well as with the Latin Americans
<br>now on the UNSC (Chile and Mexico). He averred that Spain
<br>would adopt a "completely cooperative" approach on this issue.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Leon noted his personal affinity with the U.S. He
<br>said his grandmother was an American citizen (from Baltimore,
<br>of a shipping family called Bevan, sent to Malaga on business
<br>and remained in Spain). Also present at the meeting was
<br>Rafael Descaller who essentially will have the number three
<br>post at the MFA. Descaller mentioned his very favorable
<br>experience as a Fullbright scholar at Stanford. Descallar
<br>also mentioned Latin America as another are of common
<br>U.S.-Spanish interest. Leon agreed that he and DCM should
<br>maintain a regular dialogue and open lines of communication.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) DCM also took the opportunity to ask about Spain's
<br>plans regarding its Embassy in Iraq after June 30 (reftel).
<br>Leon replied that the GOS might consider elevating the
<br>Spanish Charge to the rank of Ambassador. Leon said he would
<br>take this under consideration.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) At the close of the meeting, Leon noted that
<br>difficult issues like the Couso case (the Spanish cameraman
<br>killed during gunfire in the Palestine Hotel incident last
<br>year and a major cause celebre here), would have to be dealt
<br>with but could wait until an appropriate time. He reiterated
<br>his desire for open contacts and said he wanted to invite DCM
<br>to lunch in the near future.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Comment: Leon's professed desire for good relations
<br>with the U.S. echoes sentiments we have heard from many in
<br>the new government -- and also parallels the lack of specific
<br>details on concrete cooperation.
