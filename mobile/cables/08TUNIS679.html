<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) According to Transparency International's annual 
<br>survey and Embassy contacts' observations, corruption in 
<br>Tunisia is getting worse. Whether it's cash, services, land, 
<br>property, or yes, even your yacht, President Ben Ali's family 
<br>is rumored to covet it and reportedly gets what it wants. 
<br>Beyond the stories of the First Family's shady dealings, 
<br>Tunisians report encountering low-level corruption as well in 
<br>interactions with the police, customs, and a variety of 
<br>government ministries. The economic impact is clear, with 
<br>Tunisian investors -- fearing the long-arm of "the Family" -- 
<br>forgoing new investments, keeping domestic investment rates 
<br>low and unemployment high (Refs G, H). These persistent 
<br>rumors of corruption, coupled with rising inflation and 
<br>continued unemployment, have helped to fuel frustration with 
<br>the GOT and have contributed to recent protests in 
<br>southwestern Tunisia (Ref A). With those at the top believed 
<br>to be the worst offenders, and likely to remain in power, 
<br>there are no checks in the system. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>The Sky's the Limit 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) According to Transparency International's 2007 index, 
<br>the perception is that corruption in Tunisia is getting 
<br>worse. Tunisia's ranking on the index dropped from 43 in 
<br>2005 to 61 in 2007 (out of 179 countries) with a score of 4.2 
<br>(with 1 the most corrupt and 10 the least corrupt). Although 
<br>corruption is hard to verify and even more difficult to 
<br>quantify, our contacts all agree that the situation is headed 
<br>in the wrong direction. When asked whether he thought 
<br>corruption was better, worse, or the same, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> exclaimed in  exasperation, "Of course it's getting worse!"
<br>He stated that  corruption could not but increase as the culprits
<br>looked for  more and more opportunities. Joking about Tunisia's
<br>rising  inflation, he said that even the cost of bribes was up. "A 
<br>traffic stop used to cost you 20 dinars and now it's up to 40 
<br>or 50!" 
<br>
<br>----------------- 
<br>All in the Family 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) President Ben Ali's extended family is often cited as 
<br>the nexus of Tunisian corruption. Often referred to as a 
<br>quasi-mafia, an oblique mention of "the Family" is enough to 
<br>indicate which family you mean. Seemingly half of the 
<br>Tunisian business community can claim a Ben Ali connection 
<br>through marriage, and many of these relations are reported to 
<br>have made the most of their lineage. Ben Ali's wife, Leila 
<br>Ben Ali, and her extended family -- the Trabelsis -- provoke 
<br>the greatest ire from Tunisians. Along with the numerous 
<br>allegations of Trabelsi corruption are often barbs about 
<br>their lack of education, low social status, and conspicuous 
<br>consumption. While some of the complaints about the Trabelsi 
<br>clan seem to emanate from a disdain for their nouveau riche 
<br>inclinations, Tunisians also argue that the Trabelsis strong 
<br>arm tactics and flagrant abuse of the system make them easy 
<br>to hate. Leila's brother Belhassen Trabelsi is the most 
<br>notorious family member and is rumored to have been involved 
<br>in a wide-range of corrupt schemes from the recent Banque de 
<br>Tunisie board shakeup (Ref B) to property expropriation and 
<br>extortion of bribes. Leaving the question of their 
<br>progenitor aside, Belhassen Trabelsi's holdings are extensive 
<br>and include an airline, several hotels, one of Tunisia's two 
<br>private radio stations, car assembly plants, Ford 
<br>distribution, a real estate development company, and the list 
<br>goes on. (See Ref K for a more extensive list of his 
<br>holdings.) Yet, Belhassen is only one of Leila's ten known 
<br>siblings, each with their own children. Among this large 
<br>extended family, Leila's brother Moncef and nephew Imed are 
<br>also particularly important economic actors. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) The President is often given a pass, with many 
<br>Tunisians arguing that he is being used by the Trabelsi clan 
<br>and is unaware of their shady dealings. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> a strong supporter of the government and member of 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, told the Ambassador that the problem is 
<br>not Ben Ali, but "the Family" going too far and breaking the 
<br>rules. Nevertheless, it is hard to believe Ben Ali is not 
<br>aware, at least generally, of the growing corruption problem. 
<br>This might also reflect the seeming geographical divisions 
<br>between the Ben Ali and Trabelsi fiefdoms, with the Ben Ali 
<br>clan reportedly focused on the central coastal regional and 
<br>the Trabelsi clan operating out of the greater Tunis area and 
<br>therefore, generating the bulk of the gossip. The Ben Ali 
<br>side of the Family and his children and in-laws from his 
<br>first marriage are also implicated in a number of stories. 
<br>Ben Ali has seven siblings, of which his late brother Moncef 
<br>was a known drug trafficker, sentenced in absentia to 10 
<br>years prison in the French courts. Ben Ali has three 
<br>children with his first wife Naima Kefi: Ghaouna, Dorsaf and 
<br>Cyrine. They are married respectively to Slim Zarrouk, Slim 
<br>Chiboub, and Marouane Mabrouk -- all significant economic 
<br>powers. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>This Land is Your Land, This Land is My Land 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) With real estate development booming and land 
<br>prices on the rise, owning property or land in the right 
<br>location can either be a windfall or a one-way ticket to 
<br>expropriation. In summer 2007, Leila Ben Ali received a 
<br>desirable tract of land in Carthage for free from the GOT in 
<br>order to build the for-profit Carthage International School 
<br>(Ref F). In addition to the land, the school received a 1.8 
<br>million dinar (US $1.5 million) gift from the GOT, and within 
<br>a matter of weeks the GOT had built new roads and stoplights 
<br>to facilitate school access. It has been reported that Ms. 
<br>Ben Ali has sold the Carthage International School to Belgian 
<br>investors, but the Belgian Embassy has as yet been unable to 
<br>confirm or discount the rumor. XXXXXXXXXXXX asserted
<br>that the  school was indeed sold for a huge, but undisclosed sum.
<br>He  noted any such sale would be pure profit since Ms. Ben Ali's 
<br>received land, infrastructure, and a hefty bonus at no cost. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Construction on an enormous and garish mansion has 
<br>been underway next to the Ambassador's residence for the past 
<br>year. Multiple sources have told us that the home is that of 
<br>Sakhr Materi, President Ben Ali's son-in-law and owner of 
<br>Zitouna Radio. This prime real estate was reportedly 
<br>expropriated from its owner by the GOT for use by the water 
<br>authority, then later granted to Materi for private use. A 
<br>cafe owner recounted a similar tale to an Embassy employee, 
<br>reporting that Belhassen Trabelsi forced him to trade in a 
<br>cafe he previously owned in a prime location for his current 
<br>cafe. The cafe owner stated Trabelsi told him he could do 
<br>whatever he wanted there; if 50 dinar bribes to the police 
<br>were not effective, Trabelsi said the owner had only to call 
<br>him and he would "take care of it." 
<br>
<br>------------ 
<br>Yacht Wanted 
<br>------------ 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) In 2006, Imed and Moaz Trabelsi, Ben Ali's nephews, 
<br>are reported to have stolen the yacht of a well-connected 
<br>French businessman, Bruno Roger, Chairman of Lazard Paris. 
<br>The theft, widely reported in the French press, came to light 
<br>when the yacht, freshly painted to cover distinguishing 
<br>characteristics, appeared in the Sidi Bou Said harbor. 
<br>Roger's prominence in the French establishment created a 
<br>potential irritant in bilateral relations and according to 
<br>reports, the yacht was swiftly returned. The stolen yacht 
<br>affair resurfaced in early 2008 due to an Interpol warrant 
<br>for the two Trabelsis. In May, the brothers were brought 
<br>before Tunisian courts, in a likely effort to satisfy 
<br>international justice. The outcome of their case has not 
<br>been reported. 
<br>
<br>------------------ 
<br>Show Me Your Money 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Tunisia's financial sector remains plagued by serious 
<br>allegations of corruption and financial mismanagement. 
<br>Tunisian business people joke that the most important 
<br>relationship you can have is with your banker, reflecting the 
<br>importance of personal connections rather than a solid 
<br>business plan in securing financing. The legacy of 
<br>relationship-based banking is a sector-wide rate of 
<br>non-performing loans that is 19 percent, which remains high 
<br>but is lower than a high of 25 percent in 2001 (Ref I). 
<br>Embassy contacts are quick to point out that many of these 
<br>loans are held by wealthy Tunisian business people who use 
<br>their close ties to the regime to avoid repayment (Ref E). 
<br>Lax oversight makes the banking sector an excellent target of 
<br>opportunity, with multiple stories of "First Family" schemes. 
<br>The recent reshuffle at Banque de Tunisie (Ref B), with the 
<br>Foreign Minister's wife assuming the presidency and Belhassen 
<br>Trabelsi named to the board, is the latest example. 
<br>According to a representative from Credit Agricole, Marouane 
<br>Mabrouk, another of Ben Ali's sons-in-law, purchased a 17 
<br>percent share of the former Banque du Sud (now Attijari Bank) 
<br>shares immediately prior to the bank's privatization. This 
<br>17 percent share was critical to acquiring controlling 
<br>interest in the bank since the privatization represented only 
<br>a 35 percent share in the bank. The Credit Agricole rep 
<br>stated that Mabrouk shopped his shares to foreign banks with 
<br>a significant premium, with the tender winner, 
<br>Spanish-Moroccan Santander-Attijariwafa ultimately paying an 
<br>off the books premium to Mabrouk. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> recounted that when he was still  at his bank he used to receive
<br>phone calls from panicked  clients who stated that Belhassen Trabelsi
<br>had asked them for  money. He did not indicate whether he advised
<br>them to pay. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>The Trickle Down Effect 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) While the stories of high-level, Family corruption are 
<br>among the most flagrant and oft-repeated, Tunisians report 
<br>encountering low-level corruption more frequently in their 
<br>daily lives. Speeding tickets can be ignored, passports can 
<br>be expedited, and customs can be bypassed -- all for the 
<br>right price. Donations to the GOT's 26-26 Fund for 
<br>development or to the Bessma Society for the Handicapped -- 
<br>Leila Ben Ali's favored charity -- are also believed to 
<br>grease the wheels. Hayet Louani (protect), a well-connected 
<br>member of Parliament, faced increased pressure from the GOT 
<br>after refusing several "requests" to donate money to 
<br>Trabelsi's soccer team. XXXXXXXXXXXX reported
<br>that customs inspectors demanded 10,000  dinars to
<br>get his goods through customs; he did not reveal  whether
<br>or not he acquiesced to the demand. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Nepotism is also believed to play a significant role 
<br>in awarding scholarships and offering jobs. Knowing the 
<br>right people at the Ministry of Higher Education can 
<br>determine admission to the best schools or can mean a 
<br>scholarship for study abroad. An Embassy FSN stated that the 
<br>Director of International Cooperation, a long-time contact, 
<br>offered to give his son a scholarship to Morocco on the basis 
<br>of their acquaintance. If you do not know someone, money can 
<br>also do the trick. There are many stories of Tunisians 
<br>paying clerks at the Ministry of Higher Education to get 
<br>their children into better schools than were merited by their 
<br>test scores. Government jobs -- a prize in Tunisia -- are 
<br>also believed to be doled out on the basis of connections. 
<br>Leila Ben Ali's late mother, Hajja Nana, is also reported to 
<br>have acted as a broker for both school admissions and 
<br>government job placement, providing her facilitation services 
<br>for a commission. Among the complaints from the protestors 
<br>in the mining area of Gafsa were allegations that jobs in the 
<br>Gafsa Phosphate Company were given on the basis of 
<br>connections and bribery. 
<br>
<br>--------- 
<br>Mob Rule? 
<br>--------- 
<br>¶10. (S/NF) The numerous stories of familial corruption are 
<br>certainly galling to many Tunisians, but beyond the rumors of 
<br>money-grabbing is a frustration that the well-connected can 
<br>live outside the law. One Tunisian lamented that Tunisia was 
<br>no longer a police state, it had become a state run by the 
<br>mafia. "Even the police report to the Family!" he exclaimed. 
<br>With those at the top believed to be the worst offenders, 
<br>and likely to remain in power, there are no checks in the 
<br>system. The daughter of a former governor recounted that 
<br>Belhassen Trabelsi flew into her father's office in a rage -- 
<br>even throwing an elderly office clerk to the ground -- after 
<br>being asked to abide by laws requiring insurance coverage for 
<br>his amusement park. Her father wrote a letter to President 
<br>Ben Ali defending his decision and denouncing Trabelsi's 
<br>tactics. The letter was never answered, and he was removed 
<br>from his post shortly thereafter. The GOT's strong 
<br>censorship of the press ensures that stories of familial 
<br>corruption are not published. The Family's corruption 
<br>remains a red line that the press cross at their own peril. 
<br>Although the February imprisonment of comedian Hedi Oula 
<br>Baballah was ostensibly drug-related, human rights groups 
<br>speculate his arrest was punishment for a 30 minute stand-up 
<br>routine spoofing the President and his in-laws (Tunis D). 
<br>International NGOs have made the case that the harsh prison 
<br>conditions faced by journalist Slim Boukdhir, who was 
<br>arrested for failing to present his ID card and insulting a 
<br>police officer, are directly related to his articles 
<br>criticizing government corruption. Corruption remains a 
<br>topic relegated to hushed voices with quick glances over the 
<br>shoulder. 
<br>
<br>------------------------ 
<br>The Elephant in the Room 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) Several Tunisian economists argue that it does not 
<br>matter whether corruption is actually increasing because 
<br>"perception is reality." The perception of increasing 
<br>corruption and the persistent rumors of shady backroom 
<br>dealings has a negative impact on the economy regardless of 
<br>the veracity. Contacts tell us they afraid to invest for 
<br>fear that the family will suddenly want a cut. "What's the 
<br>point?" Alaya Bettaieb asked, "The best case scenario is that 
<br>my investment succeeds and someone important tries to take a 
<br>cut." Persistently low domestic investment rates bear this 
<br>out (Ref H). Foreign bank accounts, while illegal, are 
<br>reportedly commonplace. A recent Ministry of Finance amnesty 
<br>to encourage Tunisians to repatriate their funds has been an 
<br>abject failure. Bettaeib stated that he plans to incorporate 
<br>his new business in Mauritania or Malta, citing fear of 
<br>unwanted interference. Many economists and business people 
<br>note that strong investment in real estate and land reflects 
<br>the lack of confidence in the economy and an effort to keep 
<br>their money safe (Ref C). 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Thus far, foreign investors have been undeterred, and 
<br>according to Tunisian business contacts, largely unaffected. 
<br>Foreign investment continues to flow in at a healthy rate, 
<br>even excluding the privatizations and huge Gulf projects 
<br>which have yet to get underway. Foreign investors more 
<br>rarely report encountering the type of extortion faced by 
<br>Tunisians, perhaps reflecting that foreign investors have 
<br>recourse to their own embassies and governments. British Gas 
<br>representatives told the Ambassador they had not encountered 
<br>any impropriety. XXXXXXXXXXXX stated that several years ago 
<br>Belhassen Trabelsi attempted to strong arm a German company 
<br>producing in the offshore sector, but that after the German 
<br>Embassy intervened Trabelsi was explicitly cautioned to avoid 
<br>offshore companies. Despite pronouncements about increasing 
<br>domestic investment, the GOT focuses heavily on increasing 
<br>FDI flows to the country, particularly in the offshore 
<br>sector. Nevertheless, there are still several examples of 
<br>foreign companies or investors being pressured into joining 
<br>with the "right" partner. The prime example remains 
<br>McDonald's failed entry into Tunisia. When McDonald's chose 
<br>to limit Tunisia to one franchisee not of the GOT's choosing, 
<br>the whole deal was scuttled by the GOT's refusal to grant the 
<br>necessary authorization and McDonald's unwillingness to play 
<br>the game by granting a license to a franchisee with Family 
<br>connections. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>¶13. (S) Although the petty corruption rankles, it is the 
<br>excesses of President Ben Ali's family that inspire outrage 
<br>among Tunisians. With Tunisians facing rising inflation and 
<br>high unemployment, the conspicuous displays of wealth and 
<br>persistent rumors of corruption have added fuel to the fire. 
<br>The recent protests in the mining region of Gafsa provide a 
<br>potent reminder of the discontent that remains largely 
<br>beneath the surface. This government has based its 
<br>legitimacy on its ability to deliver economic growth, but a 
<br>growing number of Tunisians believe those as the top are 
<br>keeping the benefits for themselves. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) Corruption is a problem that is at once both 
<br>political and economic. The lack of transparency and 
<br>accountability that characterize Tunisia's political system 
<br>similarly plague the economy, damaging the investment climate 
<br>and fueling a culture of corruption. For all the talk of a 
<br>Tunisian economic miracle and all the positive statistics, 
<br>the fact that Tunisia's own investors are steering clear 
<br>speaks volumes. Corruption is the elephant in the room; it 
<br>is the problem everyone knows about, but no one can publicly 
<br>acknowledge. End Comment.
