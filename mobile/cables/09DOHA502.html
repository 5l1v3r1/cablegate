<br> 
<br>Classified By: Amb Joseph LeBaron for reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>(C) SUMMARY 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.    (C)  During their July 20-21 visit to Qatar, Assistant 
<br>Secretary of Defense (ASD) for International Security 
<br>Affairs, Ambassador Alexander Vershbow, and State 
<br>Political-Military (PM) Assistant Secretary Andrew Shapiro 
<br>held meetings with Qatar's military Chief of Staff, Major 
<br>General (MG) Hamad al-Attiyah and the Crown Prince Tamim bin 
<br>Hamad al Thani.  MG al-Attiyah and the Crown Prince tried to 
<br>assure the Assistant Secretaries that Qatar used the Chief of 
<br>Staff's visit to press Iran to respond to U.S. offers of 
<br>engagement and to dismiss as "rubbish" Iranian efforts to 
<br>blame the election crisis on U.S. and UK special services. 
<br>The U.S. affirmed displeasure with Iranian behavior, and said 
<br>the U.S. would not tolerate Iranian pursuit of nuclear 
<br>weapons.  ASD Vershbow suggested now was the time for Qatar 
<br>to distance itself from Iran and its proxies and urge Iran to 
<br>end its destabilizing behavior. 
<br>¶2.    (C) MG al Attiyah and the Crown Prince repeated the 
<br>Qatari position that they felt the need to engage all their 
<br>neighbors and that Qatar could perhaps influence Iranian 
<br>behavior through its engagement.  MG al-Attiyah also 
<br>expressed disappointment that the Large Aircraft Infrared 
<br>Counter Measure (LAIRCM) system is not available to be 
<br>installed on Qatar's recently purchased C-17 aircraft.  ASD 
<br>Vershbow said he would look into the issue further and that a 
<br>formal response from the SecDef would be forthcoming.  The 
<br>Chief of Staff also said no decision had been made on 
<br>fulfilling an earlier U.S. request to provide funding for the 
<br>refurbishment of Jordanian tanks being provided to Lebanon. 
<br>When ASD Vershbow requested that Qatar use its good offices 
<br>to help the U.S. in Yemen and induce a change in Hamas's 
<br>behavior, the Chief of Staff expressed irritation that 
<br>U.S.-Qatar friendship did not extend to issues of importance 
<br>to Qatar, such as LAIRCM.  END SUMMARY 
<br> 
<br>U.S.-QATAR RELATIONSHIP 
<br>----------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense (ASD) for 
<br>International Affairs Vershbow and Assistant Secretary of 
<br>State for Political-Military Affairs Shapiro, joined by 
<br>Ambassador, met July 20-21 over dinner and in a separate 
<br>office call with Chief of Staff (COS) Major General Hamad 
<br>al-Attiyah.  The U.S. visitors thanked the COS for Qatar's 
<br>continued hospitality and support and for hosting our 
<br>presence at both Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) and Al-Udeid Air Base 
<br>(AUAB). 
<br> 
<br>C-17 PURCHASE 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) BG General al-Malki (Commander of the Fighter Wing and 
<br>Chairman of the Transport Committee) informed ASD Vershbow 
<br>that the first C-17 was on schedule for delivery and would 
<br>depart California on August 11 with an ETA at AUAB O/A August 
<br>¶15.  In addition, BG General al-Malki mentioned his 
<br>disappointment at the delay of the pilot training program, 
<br>which will further delay the aircraft from becoming 
<br>operational.  In response, ASD Vershbow reassured him that 
<br>USG would work to resolve the issue. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) COS al-Attiyah expressed his concern to ASD regarding 
<br>the C-17 LAIRCM.  The COS stated that he was greatly 
<br>disappointed over USG disapproval of Qatar's application for 
<br>LAIRCM.  Al-Malki pointed out that other nations had acquired 
<br>the system and that Qatar's exclusion added to his 
<br>frustration.  The COS said he did not want to elevate the 
<br>matter to Qatar's civilian leadership.  He believed that 
<br>Qatar's leaders would question the benefits of the 
<br>U.S.-Qatari military relationship if the concern were to be 
<br>raised. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) ASD Vershbow responded that a letter would be 
<br>forthcoming from SECDEF explaining that Qatar would be 
<br>receiving the same aircraft as received by the United States 
<br>Air Force (USAF).  Vershbow further clarified that the LAIRCM 
<br>was an additional add-on, for which transfer to Qatar had 
<br>been disapproved.  Vershbow recommended that Qatar pursue 
<br>other options, noting he was unaware that other nations had 
<br>access to the LAIRCM system for transport aircraft.  ASD 
<br>Vershbow said he would look into the matter, adjust the 
<br>SECDEF letter as necessary and respond formally to the GOQ. 
<br>COS and al-Malki stressed Qatar's desire to use aircraft 
<br>jointly with the U.S. and Coalition Forces. 
<br> 
<br>IRAN 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>DOHA 00000502  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) ASD asked the COS to recount his visit to the Islamic 
<br>Republic of Iran.  COS briefed that his first visit to Iran 
<br>was short in duration.  The Qatari delegation praised 
<br>President Obama's Cairo Speech while in Iran and urged the 
<br>Iranians to take steps to avoid isolating themselves 
<br>internationally.  Further, the Qataris suggested that the 
<br>Iranians seek engagement and rapprochement.  ASD Vershbow 
<br>said this was the right message, and those who have contacts 
<br>with Iran should use every opportunity to persuade Iranian 
<br>leaders to end their destabilizing behavior. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) ASD Vershbow reiterated the need for Iran to take 
<br>steps to convince the international community that it was not 
<br>pursuing a nuclear weapons capability, and to end its support 
<br>for Hamas, Hizballah, and other extremist groups.    He said 
<br>we understand why Qatar, because of its close proximity and 
<br>its economic and political ties to Iran, felt the need to 
<br>engage with Iran.  Qatar should help the Iranians to avoid a 
<br>conflict with the U.S. and the international community, 
<br>remarking that "friends do not let friends drive drunk." 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) COS al-Attiyah responded that while Iran expresses a 
<br>desire privately to change its behavior, these could be 
<br>meaningless platitudes.  The COS reiterated that the GOQ 
<br>opposes any Iranian pursuit of a military nuclear capability, 
<br>noting that it would destabilize the region.  COS further 
<br>suggested that the USG continue its own dialogue with the 
<br>Islamic Republic.  COS al-Attiyah closed the discussion by 
<br>making clear that, with respect to Iran, "while we're 
<br>neighbors, we're not friends."  He summed up his recent visit 
<br>to Tehran as an overture to maintain open channels of 
<br>communication with Iran. 
<br> 
<br>LEBANON 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) ASD asked if the GOQ had a response to an earlier 
<br>request to the Prime Minister by Secretary Gates to help fund 
<br>the transfer of 55 M1A1 tanks from Jordan to Lebanon.  COS 
<br>said he was aware of the request, but that no decision had 
<br>been made.  He added that he had discussed the issue during a 
<br>recent CHOD conference with Jordanian and Lebanese 
<br>representatives. 
<br> 
<br>HAMAS 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) ASD Vershbow raised Qatar's ties with Hamas, and told 
<br>the COS that Hamas needs to be encouraged to rejoin the 
<br>Palestinian Authority and the Peace Process.  He added that 
<br>there should be "no blank checks, no checks at all," for 
<br>Hamas.  ASD suggested that Qatar was in a position to 
<br>influence Hamas; if Qatar helped bring about a change in 
<br>Hamas's behavior, it could enhance the U.S.-Qatar strategic 
<br>relationship.  COS undertook to relay that message to the 
<br>Amir and Crown Prince.  While the COS underscored that Qatar 
<br>wants a good relationship with the U.S., he noted there were 
<br>times when USG decisions sent a different signal, such as the 
<br>USG's decision on LAIRCM.  COS al-Attiyah rhetorically asked, 
<br>"Are we friends or not?" 
<br> 
<br>YEMEN 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) ASD Vershbow asked if Qatar, or the GCC as a whole, 
<br>would be renewing efforts to help solve the troubles in 
<br>Yemen, citing Qatar's previous mediation efforts.  COS 
<br>al-Attiyah responded that GOQ had engaged Yemen in the past, 
<br>but noted that maintaining productive dialogue is difficult, 
<br>given Yemen's economic plight and decentralized tribal 
<br>society.  The COS added that the GOQ was unsure how Yemeni 
<br>President Saleh plans to curtail the violence there.  He also 
<br>noted that there is little military cooperation between the 
<br>Qatar Armed Forces (QAF) and Yemen, but that he would make 
<br>the GOQ leadership aware of the ASD's interest.  The COS said 
<br>that the GCC had earlier presented a "unified package," but 
<br>its efforts in Yemen had failed.  COS al-Attiyah recommended 
<br>that this subject be addressed at the Manama Dialogue in 
<br>December. 
<br> 
<br>NSS and CIP 
<br>----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) ASD commended the COS on the upcoming 
<br>CENTCOM-GOQ-Naval War College effort to develop a National 
<br>Security Strategy.  Qatar and others in the region need to 
<br>place more emphasis on Critical Infrastructure Protection, 
<br>added the ASD.  COS al-Attiyah agreed and said he was looking 
<br>forward to this effort. (Note: OMC Qatar will escort an 
<br>interagency Qatari delegation back to Tampa August 11-13 to 
<br> 
<br>DOHA 00000502  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>begin this process.) 
<br> 
<br>CLOSING REMARKS 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) COS ended the discussions by stating that he valued 
<br>the U.S.-Qatar relationship.  The GOQ was committed to the 
<br>friendship forged between the two nations, he said.  COS said 
<br>he is looking forward to the P4 visit and expressed his 
<br>desire to invite the P4 to his beach house as schedules 
<br>permit. 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C) Qatar clearly registered its disappointment in not 
<br>receiving LAIRCM for its C-17.  We believe this could fester 
<br>into an open wound in the vital U.S.-Qatar security 
<br>relationship.  The Chief of Staff is particularly sensitive 
<br>about the issue, since Qatar's senior leadership (the Amir 
<br>and Crown Prince) holds him responsible for maintaining a 
<br>close and productive U.S.-Qatar military relationship. 
<br>However, given the Qatari leadership's perception of the 
<br>Chief of Staff's inability so far to get LAIRCM, senior 
<br>leadership may start to question the Chief of Staff's 
<br>assurances about the strength of the U.S.-Qatar military 
<br>relationship.  End Comment. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (U) This cable was cleared by Assistant Secretary of 
<br>Defense Alexander Vershbow.
