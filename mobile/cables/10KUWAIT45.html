<br>
<br>Classified By: Economic Counselor Oliver John for reasons
<br>1.4, (b), (d), (e).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary and Key Points. During a series of meetings on
<br>January 13 in Kuwait, Treasury A/S Cohen:
<br>
<br>- Emphasized the Obama administration's commitment to
<br>disrupt, dismantle, and eventually defeat Al-Qa'ida to
<br>prevent their return to Afghanistan and Pakistan;
<br>
<br>- Stressed that the Gulf-based financial support networks
<br>for the Taliban and al-Qa'ida are largely the same, making a
<br>cooperative effort on all fronts critical;
<br>
<br>- Applauded GoK's intensified efforts over the past year
<br>to combat illicit finance, but stressed the need to do more,
<br>particularly to choke off the flow of funds to extremists in
<br>South Asia;
<br>
<br>- Drew GoK attention to the upcoming FATF mutual
<br>evaluation and warned that deficiencies in Kuwait's current
<br>AML regime will have a very negative impact on that review.
<br>In this regard, he urged Kuwait to pass the amended AML law
<br>as expeditiously as possible;
<br>
<br>- Highlighted the travel ban imposed by UNSCR 1267, and
<br>urged the GoK to communicate with recipient countries (and
<br>with the USG) if it learns of impending travel.
<br>
<br>- For their part, Kuwaiti officials expressed their
<br>interest in cooperating with the USG to combat terrorism and
<br>their strong concern about the crisis in Yemen and its
<br>potential impact on GCC states. They were reluctant to
<br>speculate on how long it would take parliament to pass the
<br>amended AML legislation, but stressed that the GoK had passed
<br>it to parliament on "an urgent basis". xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>committed to following-up on the travel of Kuwait's 3 UNSCR
<br>1267 designees. End Summary and Key Points.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx, Treasury A/S Cohen accompanied by
<br>Ambassador met with xxxxxxxxxxxx. A/S Cohen also met separately with xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>Department for Combating Money Laundering Department. The
<br>meetings also provided an opportunity to deliver ref F
<br>points.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) In the context of POTUS' strategic focus on
<br>Afghanistan and Pakistan, A/S Cohen highlighted concerns
<br>about funding of extremist groups in South Asia, such as
<br>Al-Qa'ida and the Taliban. Cohen stated USG concerns that
<br>terrorist facilitators were still operating in Kuwait and
<br>urged GoK officials to increase efforts to combat terrorist
<br>financing and facilitation from Kuwaiti sources. Cohen
<br>raised concern over funds going to extremist groups in Yemen,
<br>Afghanistan and Pakistan and noted that the funding networks
<br>were interconnected, rendering impractical an approach to
<br>disrupting financing that sought to differentiate between the
<br>Taliban and Al-Qa'ida. (Note: The GoK has been much more
<br>concerned with the Al-Qa'ida threat than the Taliban. End
<br>Note.)
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) GoK officials reaffirmed Kuwait's commitment to an
<br>on-going partnership with the USG and their interest in
<br>stopping the financing of terrorism. They acknowledged
<br>deficiencies in the Kuwaiti legal framework, but also
<br>stressed that their current procedures -- especially on
<br>charities regulations -- had brought the issue under better
<br>control. xxxxxxxxxxxx explained that that the Ministry of
<br>Social and Labor Affairs (MoSAL) and the Ministry of Foreign
<br>Affairs (MFA) oversee charitable funds sent abroad. He
<br>described the process by which MoSAL and MFA engage Kuwaiti
<br>embassies, coordinate with host governments to verify the
<br>legitimacy of charities and projects before funds are
<br>distributed, and then complete an audit of projects to verify
<br>activity (ref c). Prefacing his remarks with "we are 100%
<br>with you in Afghanistan," xxxxxxxxxxxx said that
<br>"fortunately" Kuwaiti charities have accepted the new
<br>controls and understand that "money needs to be followed and
<br>tracked to the last dollar". xxxxxxxxxxxx stated "we are
<br>keeping an eye on extremists; Kuwait has learned from past
<br>mistakes and has taken action to successfully reduce criminal
<br>activity". He observed that improved regulations were
<br>forcing criminals to move their money outside the formal
<br>financial network "by hand". All officials stressed that GoK
<br>efforts to implement new policies and oversight procedures
<br>has aided in deterring criminals from moving funds to
<br>extremist groups; in that context they welcomed increased
<br>bilateral cooperation to further build Kuwaiti capacity and
<br>capabilities, but sought "concrete evidence" as well as
<br>"suggestive intelligence", so that further legal action could
<br>be taken.
<br>
<br>
<br>Yemen: A Growing CT Concern
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) GoK officials expressed concern about recent
<br>activities in Yemen, specifically over the growth of
<br>Al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).xxxxxxxxxxxx and
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx both denied allegations by Yemen's Prime
<br>Minister that Kuwaiti Shi'a were funding Shi'a Houthi
<br>militants in Yemen. xxxxxxxxxxxx requested details about
<br>Yemeni CT cooperation with the USG, noting that Al-Qa'ida was
<br>trying to control Yemen, and that "our role" (i.e., the
<br>international community) is to dry up sources of funding,
<br>which required extensive international cooperation. Although
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx acknowledged and encouraged USG efforts in
<br>Afghanistan noting that "the cost is high but the only choice
<br>is to continue the mission to reduce the threat," he urged
<br>early efforts to prevent Yemen from becoming another
<br>Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) With regard to Kuwaiti actions, xxxxxxxxxxxx noted GoK
<br>aid efforts in Yemen. He said that "if we don't fund
<br>positive interventions such as schools and mosques for 'at
<br>risk' youth, extremists will fill the vacuum". xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>confirmed that funds sent to Yemen were distributed through
<br>an MFA account housed at the CBK and that the GoK coordinated
<br>with the GoY as part of Kuwait's process for monitoring
<br>charitable giving. He noted that Kuwait's Foreign Minister
<br>Dr. Sheikh Mohammed Al-Sabah would attend UK Prime Minister
<br>Gordon Brown's January 28th International Summit on Yemen on
<br>Kuwait's behalf and that the GCC has planned an advance
<br>meeting of the donor's conference to discuss how to support
<br>Yemen. He noted concerns that aid channeled through the GoY
<br>would not reach the people, due to endemic corruption, but
<br>asked then "who" could coordinate aid.
<br>
<br>
<br>Amended AML Law Needed Before FATF Evaluation
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) A/S Cohen cautioned that the lack of a FATF-compliant
<br>AML law that outlawed terrorist financing would hurt Kuwait
<br>in the upcoming Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
<br>evaluation. He urged the GoK to do whatever possible to push
<br>parliament to pass the pending AML law as Kuwait is the only
<br>GCC country that does not outlaw terror financing. Kuwaiti
<br>officials stressed that the amended AML law, as proposed to
<br>Parliament, would significantly improve the ongoing efforts
<br>to deal with illicit finance. They thanked Cohen for USG
<br>suggestions on improving the draft amended law as well as the
<br>participation from the USG at the December AML conference
<br>(ref d). They expressed confidence that this law would give
<br>them the necessary legislation to properly enforce and
<br>prosecute financial crimes. They also noted that Kuwait is
<br>engaged in several public awareness campaigns including the
<br>impact of money laundering and a de-radicalization campaign
<br>highlighting the negative impact of extremism.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) GoK officials expressed their hope that Parliament has
<br>prioritized the amended AML legislation, but were less
<br>sanguine on the law's chances for passage. xxxxxxxxxxxx said
<br>that he hoped parliament would pass the law, but guessed that
<br>there was a 50/50 chance that the government will gather
<br>enough votes to pass it within this term. He also noted that
<br>the law is a step in the right direction, but even if it is
<br>passed challenges exist in getting the courts to 'work' as
<br>cases take three to four years to prosecute and then if
<br>appealed another three to four years to conclude.
<br>
<br>More Needs to Be Done
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) A/S Cohen noted the continued need to disrupt
<br>terrorist funding streams. He noted that funding from Kuwait
<br>to extremist networks in South Asia is of particular concern,
<br>especially funding of Taliban activity in the AF/PAK region.
<br>Cohen stated the US would support Kuwait's efforts to combat
<br>illicit finance and to pursue the passage of current
<br>legislation in any way necessary. He offered assistance in
<br>capacity building for enforcement and prosecutorial
<br>authorities that would help fulfill FATF recommendations. He
<br>also acknowledged the need to share detailed information
<br>about suspected financiers and facilitators.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) A/S Cohen acknowledged the importance of efforts to
<br>disrupt planned attacks against U.S. and Kuwaiti targets and
<br>the significance of holding open trials to dissuade others.
<br>He expressed concern, however, that the three Kuwaiti UN 1267
<br>designees (Al Bathali, Al-Ali, and Jalamah) and others, are
<br>still traveling and providing support to extremist groups. He
<br>cited the recent travel of UN 1267 designee Hamid Al-Ali to
<br>Turkey in February 2009 and the GoK request to the UNSC to
<br>waive travel restrictions for two 1267 designees to make the
<br>Hajj pilgrimmage. A/S Cohen stressed that the UNSC 1267
<br>travel ban was one of the more effective sanctions and urged
<br>the GOK to notify destination countries (and the USG whenever
<br>possible), as well as the UN of planned designee travel.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx noted the difficulties involved in monitoring
<br>intra-GCC travel (since GCC nationals can travel on ID cards
<br>rather than passports), but committed to following up to
<br>ensure that 1267 designees are being handled according to UN
<br>mandate. For his part, xxxxxxxxxxxx asserted that the GoK
<br>is keeping a close watch on known terrorists/facilitators and
<br>receives reports on their activities from their own families.
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Comment. Cohen's visit came at a good time given
<br>growing Kuwaiti concerns about terrorism and instability
<br>emanating from Yemen. To the extent an Af/Pak-Yemen
<br>connection can be developed for the GoK, USG-GoK strategic
<br>interests can be aligned further. The visit usefully
<br>reinforced the USG's capacity building strategy and
<br>encouraged closer overall CT cooperation; Cohen's GoK
<br>interlocutors were generally receptive to the idea of an
<br>enhanced bilateral training program aimed at combating
<br>financial crimes. The proposed interagency capacity building
<br>program will build a constituency here as will our
<br>willingness to help the GoK take the steps they need to take
<br>for the upcoming FATF mutual evaluation. While incremental
<br>progress is possible within the existing legal framework,
<br>passage of an amended AML/CTF law is clearly necessary to
<br>give authorities here the necessary legal tools to
<br>effectively combat terror financing and other financial
<br>crimes. End Comment
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) A/S Cohen has cleared this message.
