<br>TAGS: PREL PARM PTER TU
<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER:  YOUR VISIT TO TURKEY 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador James F. Jeffrey reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Sandy, Glad you'll be able to visit Turkey at this key 
<br>time. Your short visit will give you an opportunity to engage 
<br>with key Turkish leaders on, first and foremost in their 
<br>minds, missile defense.  The Turks are keen to learn more 
<br>about U.S. plans, in particular what role the U.S. 
<br>wants/expects Turkey and others in Europe to play.  The 
<br>Turkish General Staff (TGS) will be interested in our ideas 
<br>for HLDG reform, even if they may be slow to accept them. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) You know how broad our agenda is with Turkey.  As you 
<br>will have a short time in country, I suggest you focus on a 
<br>few key issues. 
<br> 
<br>Be sure to raise: 
<br>------------------ 
<br>- Missile Defense, with emphasis on how the U.S. will look to 
<br>several Allies - not just Turkey - for help (para 3) 
<br>- Repeat our commitment to our intel and other support for 
<br>strikes against the PKK (para 5-6) 
<br>- Appreciation for Turkey's efforts on Afghanistan/Pakistan 
<br>(para 13) 
<br>- Float the idea of HLDG reform and ensure Guner knows we 
<br>expect him in Washington (para 4) 
<br>- Press for a realistic assessment of Turkey's view of the 
<br>threat assessment from Iran (para 10) 
<br> 
<br>Watch Out For: 
<br>--------------- 
<br>- Pressure for direct U.S. milops against the PKK (paras 
<br>11-12) 
<br>- Conflation of Turkey's exploration of air defense 
<br>capabilities with our Missile Defense needs (para 3) 
<br> 
<br>Missile Defense 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) The Turks will appreciate your update on U.S. missile 
<br>defense plans and in particular will expect you to have 
<br>specific ideas on how Turkey would contribute to the PAA. 
<br>While the top-level bureaucrats with whom you will meet will 
<br>understand the rationale for the PAA and will be ready to 
<br>explore ways Turkey can help, the political environment for a 
<br>request to base assets in Turkey is mixed, and Turkey's 
<br>perception of the Iranian threat to its territory differs 
<br>from ours.  The GOT continues to tread a fine line in 
<br>managing its strong relationship with the U.S. and its ties 
<br>with both the Islamic world and Russia.  The government must 
<br>be able to demonstrate that any missile defense program is 
<br>not specifically anti-Iran, nor blatantly pro-Israel. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) Likewise, it will want to ensure that Russia is not 
<br>opposed to Turkey's role.  Also important will be clarity on 
<br>the degree to which this system is a NATO one, under NATO 
<br>Command and Control (C2).  The PAA would presumably 
<br>complement Turkey's effort to establish a domestic missile 
<br>defense capability that would protect Turkey's major 
<br>population centers.  The PAC-3 has been offered in response 
<br>to Turkey's air defense tender and you should highlight the 
<br>system's ability to be interoperable with any future NATO 
<br>command and control architecture. 
<br> 
<br>HLDG 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) You will need to outline U.S. views to streamline and 
<br>alter the current HLDG format to make it into a more 
<br>substantive discussion.  The Turks are shy to stray from the 
<br>status quo; you should emphasize why we feel this change is 
<br>necessary while underscoring that it is vitally important the 
<br>DCHOD Guner attend the upcoming HLDG in December, when 
<br>decisions about future dialogues will be agreed upon.  (We 
<br>have learned that the new position of TGS number three, a 
<br>four-star slot held by General Balanli (with a focus on 
<br>hardware), might get the nod for the HLDG representative. 
<br>We've told Guner it should be his.)  You should also be 
<br>prepared for the Turkish General Staff to raise the Shared 
<br>Defense Vision document, as they await a response to their 
<br>latest proposed text. 
<br> 
<br>PKK 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Turkey's counter-terrorist efforts against the PKK 
<br>have evolved in the past year and have expanded beyond 
<br>military action alone.  Although the government's Democratic 
<br>(i.e., Kurdish) Initiative is not yet fully developed, the 
<br>government has increased social and economic support to 
<br>ethnic Kurds in southeast Turkey, has dramatically broadened 
<br>the rights of Kurds to use their own language, and increased 
<br>educational opportunities as well.  It is our view that the 
<br>TGS military success against the PKK, supported by our 
<br>intelligence--sharing operation, has given the civilians the 
<br>political space to explore this "opening."  Turkish military 
<br>operations against the PKK continue, however, and on  October 
<br>6 Parliament extended the government's mandate to conduct 
<br>cross-border operations against the PKK in Iraq for another 
<br>year. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C)  Our 2007 decision to share operational intelligence 
<br>was a turning point for the bilateral relationship, and 
<br>President Obama's declaration before the Turkish Parliament 
<br>of our continuing commitment to support Turkey's fight 
<br>against the PKK was warmly welcomed.  This cooperation has 
<br>helped to improve our bilateral relationship across the 
<br>board.  Turkey's military leaders value this intelligence and 
<br>the advice our military leaders give them.  Our work has made 
<br>it difficult for PKK terrorists to use northern Iraq as a 
<br>safe haven.  Turkish causalities are still occurring, 
<br>however, and an increasing proportion are from IEDs.  Due to 
<br>pressure on Chief of Staff General Basbug and the Turkish 
<br>General Staff (TGS) to "finish off" the PKK this year, the 
<br>government wants and has requested direct U.S. kinetic action 
<br>against the PKK; we have refused this request to date due to 
<br>our own rules of engagement.  The GOT has also requested the 
<br>sale of armed MQ-9/Reaper UAVs, which will be a challenge to 
<br>fulfill (see para 10). 
<br> 
<br>Northern Iraq 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Turkey will not consider any alternative to the 
<br>political  unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, but has 
<br>become more flexible on how it engages "the local authorities 
<br>of northern Iraq" (how Turkey refers officially to the 
<br>Kurdish Regional Government (KRG)).  Turkey's policy remains 
<br>focused on the government in Baghdad, but its outreach to the 
<br>KRG is expanding.  This outreach is reinforced by the 
<br>continued dominance of Turkish products and investments in 
<br>the KRG's healthy economy.  It is also tied to turkey's new 
<br>opening to its own Kurds, by far the biggest and most 
<br>controversial domestic political issue here. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) The U.S.-Turkey-Iraq Tripartite Security talks 
<br>continue regularly and a new Tripartite operational office in 
<br>Erbil, established to share counter-PKK intelligence was 
<br>established over the summer.  The Turks remain shy to share 
<br>data; they are not convinced that they can trust 
<br>Iraqi/Kurdish individuals to keep information concerning 
<br>operations secret.  Nevertheless, it is a step in the right 
<br>direction.  Turkish military officials have become more 
<br>strident in their calls for KRG officials to take action 
<br>against the PKK. 
<br> 
<br>U.S. Drawdown through Turkey 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) Habur Gate and the Incirlik Cargo Hub -- vital to our 
<br>sustainment operations -- could be helpful in our drawdown if 
<br>other options prove too difficult.  Minister of National 
<br>Defense Vedci Gonul suggested to Secretary Gates in June that 
<br>Turkey was ready to agree to the increased use of Incirlik 
<br>for this purpose.  Using the surface route from Habur Gate to 
<br>Mediterranean ports (Iskenderun, Mersin) is also worth 
<br>exploring, and we may be able to involve Turkish commercial 
<br>shippers in support of the Northern Distribution Network.  We 
<br>caution that the rough terrain, security environment, and the 
<br>cantankerous nature of the Turkish government bureaucracy 
<br>will challenge any U.S. operation.  Nevertheless, we are 
<br>evaluating these options in cooperation with CENTCOM and 
<br>EUCOM partners. 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>------ 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Turkey understands and partially shares U.S. and 
<br>international concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, but is 
<br>hesitant to use harsh language in public statements, in part 
<br>due to its dependence on Iran as an energy supplier and as a 
<br>trade route to Central Asian markets.  PM Erdogan himself is 
<br>a particularly vocal skeptic of the U.S. position.  Turkey 
<br>believes international pressure against Iran only helps to 
<br>strengthen Ahmadinejad and the hard-liners.  However, it 
<br>continues to press Iran quietly to accept the P5 plus 1 
<br>offer.  The GOT is a strong partner in our non-proliferation 
<br>efforts, with several significant results.  Politically, 
<br>Turkey will try to position itself on Iran between wherever 
<br>we are and where Russia is.  In a pinch or if pressed, the 
<br>Turks will slant to us. 
<br> 
<br>UAVs and Attack Helicopters 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Turkey seeks to acquire, on an urgent basis, its own 
<br>UAV capability.  The administration has made clear at high 
<br>levels that we support this goal, and Turkey has pending 
<br>request to acquire armed Reaper UAVs.  Ultimate approval for 
<br>armed Reapers is complicated due to MTCR obligations and Hill 
<br>concerns.  However, even if those could be overcome, the 
<br>delivery pipeline for these systems is long, and Turkey's 
<br>leaders have sought reassurance that we will not pull our 
<br>intelligence support until they can replace it.  We have not 
<br>made this commitment to date. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Additionally, bad procurement decisions led Turkey to 
<br>a severe shortage of attack helicopters, desperately needed 
<br>for its fight against the PKK  Turkey has looked to us to 
<br>help them bridge the capability gap, asking to purchase 
<br>additional AH-1W Super Cobra aircraft.  These aircraft are in 
<br>short supply in our own inventory, but Secretary Gates and 
<br>VCJCS Cartwright have promised to try to support with request 
<br>within a few years (four each in 2011, 2012, and 2013).  The 
<br>Turks took this as an affirmative, and recently started 
<br>pressing for delivery in 2010 instead of 2011. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Afghanistan/Pakistan 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Turkey has commanded ISAF twice since its inception 
<br>and will take command of RC-Capital this November. Turkey 
<br>leads PRT Wardak and plans to open a second PRT in Jawzjan in 
<br>early 2010.  Turkey has sponsored the "Ankara Process" 
<br>dialogue, one of several efforts to encourage constructive 
<br>communications between Kabul and Islamabad and is a leading 
<br>participant in the Friends of Democratic Pakistan.  Turkey 
<br>pledged significant aid to both countries:  USD 200 million 
<br>to Afghanistan and USD 100 million to Pakistan.  Because of 
<br>its culture, history and religious orientation, as well as 
<br>Foreign Minister Davutoglu's strategic ambition, Turkey is 
<br>well disposed to act as an agent of the international 
<br>community's goals in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Constraining 
<br>Turkey's potential is a lack of resources.  Our conversations 
<br>with Turkish interlocutors have helped us identify several 
<br>areas in which Turkey can be of particular help:  education 
<br>and health, military training and support, economics, 
<br>counter-narcotics, and trilateral engagement.  (Note:  Turkey 
<br>will not support any CT operations in Afghanistan.  They do 
<br>not believe there is a NATO/ISAF mandate to engage in these 
<br>operations, and they additionally have national caveats 
<br>preventing them from participating in NATO/ISAF CT 
<br>operations.  The GOT also believes that ISAF should not/not 
<br>be engaged in the counter-narcotics fight, believing that 
<br>foreign fighters who engage in this fight just produces 
<br>antipathy against foreign forces in the local population.  I 
<br>do, however, believe the GOT are willing to engage the 
<br>training of Afghan security forces.) 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Caucasus 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) Turkey seeks to develop itself as a regional power 
<br>and recognizes that the Caucasus region, stymied in its 
<br>growth by frozen conflicts, could turn to Turkey for develop. 
<br> The signing of the Protocol document in Zurich on October 10 
<br>was a landmark for the region, and should serve as a starting 
<br>point for establishing bilateral relations and, ultimately, 
<br>the opening of its closed border.  Nevertheless, future 
<br>relations will still be heavily linked to the 1915 "genocide" 
<br>issue and the resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict 
<br>between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  Turkey consistently warns 
<br>that any U.S. determination of the events of 1915 as 
<br>"genocide" would set off a political firestorm in Turkey, and 
<br>the devastating effect on our bilateral relationship -- 
<br>including political, military, and commercial aspects -- 
<br>would be unavoidable. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Political Environment 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) PM Erdogan's Islamist-leaning Justice and Development 
<br>(AK) Party is squarely in the driver's seat, but fears an 
<br>erosion of its political base from more conservative/Islamist 
<br>parties.  Civilian-military relations remain complex.  Chief 
<br>of Staff General Basbug has worked out a modus vivendi with 
<br>PM Erdogan, but the long-running struggle between Turkey's 
<br>secularists (with the Army as its champion) and Islamists 
<br>(represented by the government) naturally puts them at odds. 
<br>Erdogan has the clear upper hand, a fact with which Basbug 
<br>has seemingly learned to live.  Alleged past military 
<br>involvement in coup contingency planning or even deliberate 
<br>generation of internal chaos remains political theme number 
<br>one and preoccupies both Erdogan and Basbug and their 
<br>respective underlings. 
<br> 
<br>Israel 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) While the Foreign Ministry and the Turkish General 
<br>Staff agree with us that a strong Turkey-Israel relationship 
<br>is essential for regional stability, PM Erdogan has sought to 
<br>shore up his domestic right political flank at the expense of 
<br>this relationship.  His outburst at Davos was the first in a 
<br>series of events the results of which we and his staff have 
<br>sought to contain.  The latest of these was Exercise 
<br>Anatolian Eagle.  Erdogan canceled Israel's participation 
<br>hours before the exercise was to begin.  With an Israeli 
<br>strike - across Turkish airspace - against targets in Iran a 
<br>possibility, Erdogan decided he could not afford the 
<br>political risk of being accused of training the forces which 
<br>would carry out such a raid.  Through some remarkable work 
<br>with Allies and with the inter-agency, we engineered a public 
<br>"postponement" of the international portion of the exercise, 
<br>but the relationship has begun to sour.
