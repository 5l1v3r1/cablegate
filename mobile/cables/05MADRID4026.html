<br>
<br>¶1. Summary: Ambassador's courtesy call was characterized by
<br>good atmospherics but little indication that the GOS will
<br>move significantly on the issues of concern to us. Minister
<br>Calvo started by enthusiatically describing U.S.- Spain
<br>cultural cooperation hightlights, especially the upcoming
<br>Picasso exhibit. The Minister agreed with the Ambassador on
<br>the need to fight Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
<br>violations but did not indicate that the GOS would put more
<br>energy into implementing its own excellent anti-piracy plan.
<br>Calvo said that the U.S. firm, Odyssey Exploration Ltd.,
<br>could look for HMS Sussex if it provided a work plan to the
<br>regional government in Andalucia, although work plans have
<br>been delivered in the past. Calvo said that the GOS believed
<br>it was more appropriate for the Thyssen Foundation to respond
<br>to Ambassador O'Donnell's letter to her regarding the
<br>Pissarro painting claimed by Claude Cassirer, although the
<br>GOS is on the Foundation board and has a lot of influence
<br>over what the board does. End Summary
<br>
<br>------------
<br>Participants
<br>------------
<br>
<br>¶2. International Cooperation and Cultural Communication
<br>Director General Carlos Alberdi Alonso accompanied the
<br>Minister. Economic Officer accompanied the Ambassador.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>U.S.- Spain Cultural/Educational Cooperation
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. Minister Calvo mentioned the upcoming 2006 Prado Picasso
<br>exhibit, which will include loaned works from several
<br>American institutions. The Embassy's Public Affairs section
<br>is working to facilitate these loans with a number of U.S.
<br>institutions. Calvo also mentioned that prior to her
<br>political career (she was Andalucia's equivalent of Minister
<br>of Culture before President Zapatero invited her to assume
<br>the national cultural portfolio) she was a professor at the
<br>University of Cordoba. She said that she had worked on the
<br>PRESHCO (Oberlin College, Smith College, The College of
<br>Wooster, Trinity College, Wellesley College, and Wheaton)
<br>Hispanic Studies Program with the University of Cordoba which
<br>was enormously successful. The Minister also mentioned she
<br>was a Bruce Springsteen fan.
<br>
<br>------------------------
<br>IPR Protection Important
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. The Ambassador said the September 28 (ref A) IPR
<br>Roundtable had been a successful instance of U.S.-Spain
<br>cooperation. The Minister agreed and said that the police
<br>had told her that IPR violators made more money than drug
<br>traffickers. She added that IPR violations were a "big
<br>problem" in Spain. Local industry groups have been making
<br>the GOS aware of the extent of the IPR problem.
<br>
<br>--------------
<br>Cassirer Claim
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶5. Ambassador mentioned that Ambassador O'Donnell had not
<br>received a response to his June 27, 2005 letter to Minister
<br>Calvo re:the Cassirer claim. Calvo acknowledged that she had
<br>not responded. She also said that Foreign Minister Moratinos
<br>had raised the issue with her. Calvo said that because the
<br>Pisarro painting claimed by Cassirer belonged to the Thyssen
<br>Foundation (of which the GOS is a board member), it would be
<br>more appropriate for the Foundation to respond to Ambassador
<br>O'Donnell's letter. She added that while the GOS "presides
<br>over the patrimony" of the Foundation, the GOS cannot
<br>"unilaterally" decide what to do. She asked her staffer,
<br>Alberdi Alonso, to follow up with Economic Officer on this
<br>matter. (Note: Economic Officer discussed the Cassirer claim
<br>with Alberdi Alonso. He noted that Spanish Cultural
<br>Counselor Sobredo had recently discussed the claim with
<br>Ambassador O'Donnell. Alberdi Alonso said that Ambassador
<br>O'Donnell had conveyed "disappointment" to Sobredo re: this
<br>matter. Alberdi Alonso committed to following up. Embassy
<br>will continue to press the GOS on the desirability of the
<br>Foundation meeting directly with the family to resolve the
<br>claim.)
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>Odyssey and the Search for HMS Sussex
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. Ambassador mentioned that the Regional Authority of
<br>Andalucia had still not responded to Odyssey's request to
<br>name an observer to accompany the Odyssey in its search for
<br>HMS Sussex. (Note: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
<br>authorized in an August 18, 2005 diplomatic note to the
<br>Embassy the Odyssey to search for the Sussex as long as the
<br>Odyssey contacted the regional authorities to get a
<br>representative to accompany the Odyssey. The authorities
<br>have, however, never responded to Odyssey's inquiries re; the
<br>topic. See refs B and C.) Calvo said she was intimately
<br>acquainted with this subject and said that the Odyssey had
<br>never provided the regional authorities with a work plan as
<br>had been requested. She suggested that once a work plan was
<br>provided, the issue could be resolved. (Note: Emboffs remain
<br>in regular contact with Odyssey officials in the U.S. and
<br>Odyssey's attorneys in Madrid. The Minister was disingenuous
<br>in her response to the Ambassador because Odyssey has
<br>provided voluminous information to both GOS and Andalucian
<br>authorities.)
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>¶7. The atmospherics of the meeting were good. Calvo clearly
<br>has religion like the rest of her cabinet colleagues on the
<br>need have good relations with the U.S. However, with respect
<br>to the three big issues we have with her Ministry, her
<br>ability/willingness to deliver is questionable. On IPR
<br>matters there is philosophical agreement between the U.S. and
<br>Spain on most issues, but so far her Ministry has not
<br>implemented its otherwise excellent anti-piracy plan
<br>vigorously. On the Cassirer claim, the GOS could get the
<br>Foundation to, at a minimum, provide an interim response to
<br>Ambassador O'Donnell's letter without paying a discernible
<br>price. The Odyssey is a six year saga with Minister Calvo on
<br>record in the past as saying that the Odyssey would only
<br>search for HMS Sussex "over her dead body". The American
<br>company is likely to commence the search for the Sussex in
<br>the coming weeks and take the risk of having a Civil Guard
<br>boat boarding the vessel. The U.S. company is in a legally
<br>strong position given the MFA diplomatic note authorizing the
<br>search. Minister Calvo's staffer, Carlos Alberdi Alonso,
<br>said the MFA had mistakenly provided the authorization as
<br>compentency lies with the regional authorities, but given the
<br>MFA note and the overwhelming weight of international law
<br>favoring the U.S. firm, the risk of boarding may well be
<br>worth taking for the Odyssey. .
