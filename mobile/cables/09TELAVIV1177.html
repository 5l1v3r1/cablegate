<br>SUBJECT: CODELS CASEY AND ACKERMAN MEET WITH DEFENSE 
<br>MINISTER BARAK 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, reasons 1.4 (b,d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  Post hosted two CODELS during the week of 
<br>May 25: one from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee led 
<br>by Senator Casey, the other from the House Committee on 
<br>Foreign Affairs led by Congressman Ackerman.  Both 
<br>delegations met with Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who 
<br>conveyed similar points on the Peace Process and Israel's 
<br>concerns about Iran.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>Peace Process 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Barak began his meeting with the Casey delegation by 
<br>apologizing for being late due to what he described as an 
<br>"internal debate" at the Prime Minister's office regarding 
<br>the development of a response to President Obama's upcoming 
<br>speech in Cairo.  He noted there are "perceived gaps" between 
<br>the USG and the GOI regarding the Peace Process, and 
<br>explained the GOI's internal debate is focused primarily on 
<br>how to ensure that the U.S. and Israel "trust each other." 
<br>Barak expressed confidence that PM Netanyahu is sincere in 
<br>wanting to "seize this opportunity and move forward" with the 
<br>Palestinians, but alluded to members of the coalition who do 
<br>not agree with this course of action. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) From his perspective, Barak told the Casey delegation 
<br>that the GOI was in no position to dictate policy to the 
<br>Palestinians or the USG regarding the Peace Process -- "it 
<br>takes two to tango, and three to negotiate," he said.  Barak 
<br>noted that it is the GOI's responsibility to ensure that "no 
<br>stone is left unturned" regarding the Peace Process; if 
<br>efforts to achieve peace ultimately fail, then the GOI must 
<br>be able to state that every effort was pursued.  He said he 
<br>personally had no objection to "two states for two nations," 
<br>and panned Arab arguments for a bi-national state in Israel. 
<br>Barak said Israel envisions "two peoples living side by side 
<br>in peace and good neighborliness" as the final goal. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) With the Ackerman delegation, Barak focused on the 
<br>need for a regional approach to the peace process.  He 
<br>supports a regional initiative for peace and cooperation for 
<br>the entire Middle East region to be launched by Israel.  He 
<br>stressed as well the need to build trust and convince the 
<br>U.S. administration that the new Israeli government is 
<br>"serious in its efforts toward peace." 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Barak commented on political developments in the West 
<br>Bank and Gaza in both meetings.  He said the GOI continues to 
<br>review its policy, and then added that the Palestinian 
<br>Authority has much to accomplish in terms of law enforcement, 
<br>a functioning judiciary, and regaining control of Gaza before 
<br>a "balanced" Palestinian state can be created.  He has been 
<br>extremely impressed with the work of U.S. Security 
<br>Coordinator Gen. Dayton training PA security forces, and 
<br>commended Salam Fayyad's concrete, practical approach. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Barak made clear in these meetings that he feels the 
<br>Palestinian Authority is weak and lacks self-confidence, and 
<br>that Gen. Dayton's training helps bolster confidence.  He 
<br>explained that the GOI had consulted with Egypt and Fatah 
<br>prior to Operation Cast Lead, asking if they were willing to 
<br>assume control of Gaza once Israel defeated Hamas.  Not 
<br>surprisingly, Barak said, the GOI received negative answers 
<br>from both.  He stressed the importance of continued 
<br>consultations with both Egypt and Fatah -- as well as the NGO 
<br>community -- regarding Gaza reconstruction, and to avoid 
<br>publicly linking any resolution in Gaza to the release of 
<br>kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit. 
<br> 
<br>Iran/North Korea 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) In his meeting with CODEL Casey, Barak said the GOI 
<br>believes its "keystone" relations with the USG remain strong. 
<br> He described the integral role the USG plays in preserving 
<br>Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME), especially when 
<br>faced with threats posed by Iran, Hizballah, and Hamas.  He 
<br>noted that the GOI's positions on Iran are well known, and 
<br>described North Korea's recent nuclear test as a "second 
<br>wake-up call" (the first being the AQ Khan network).  Barak 
<br>asked rhetorically how a lack of firm response to North Korea 
<br>would be interpreted by Iran's leadership, speculating the 
<br>USG would be viewed as a "paper tiger." 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) In both meetings, Barak said "no option should be 
<br>removed from the table" when confronting Iran and North 
<br>Korea; engagement will only work in conjunction with a 
<br>credible military option, he said.  Barak said he was 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00001177  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>personally skeptical that engagement would lead to an 
<br>acceptable resolution, and argued in favor of a paradigm 
<br>shift to confront the triple threat posed by nuclear 
<br>proliferation, Islamic extremist terrorism, and rogue/failing 
<br>states.  He said a strategic partnership with China, Russia, 
<br>India, and the EU is essential in facing these threats. 
<br>Barak argued that failure to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran 
<br>would result in a nuclear arms race in the region as Turkey, 
<br>Egypt, and Saudi Arabia look to acquire nuclear weapons. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) When asked if the USG and GOI have fundamental 
<br>differences of opinion when assessing Iran's nuclear program, 
<br>Barak said we share the same intelligence, but acknowledged 
<br>differences in analysis.  He suggested that the USG view is 
<br>similar to presenting evidence in a criminal court case in 
<br>which a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty. 
<br>As such, USG standards are tougher -- especially following 
<br>the failure to find WMD in Iraq -- while end-products such as 
<br>the 2007 NIE unintentionally take on a softer tone as a 
<br>result.  Barak said the fate of the region and the world 
<br>rests on our ability to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear 
<br>weapons -- as such, the standards for determining guilt 
<br>should be lower as the costs are higher. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) In both meetings, Barak described Iranians as "chess, 
<br>not backgammon players."  As such, Iran will attempt to avoid 
<br>any hook to hang accusations on, and look to Pakistan and 
<br>North Korea as models to emulate in terms of acquiring 
<br>nuclear weapons while defying the international community. 
<br>He doubted Tehran would opt for an open, relatively 
<br>low-threshold test like the recent one in North Korea. 
<br>Rather, Iran will seek ways to bypass the NPT while ensuring 
<br>its program is redundant and well-protected to prevent an 
<br>irreparable military strike.  Barak estimated a window 
<br>between 6 and 18 months from now in which stopping Iran from 
<br>acquiring nuclear weapons might still be viable.  After that, 
<br>he said, any military solution would result in unacceptable 
<br>collateral damage.  He also expressed concern that should 
<br>Iran develop nuclear capabilities, other rogue states and/or 
<br>terrorist groups would not be far behind. 
<br> 
<br>Pakistan 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Barak reinforced his message regarding Pakistan in 
<br>both meetings.  He described Pakistan as his "private 
<br>nightmare," suggesting the world might wake up one morning 
<br>"with everything changed" following a potential Islamic 
<br>extremist takeover.  When asked if the use of force on Iran 
<br>might backfire with moderate Muslims in Pakistan, thereby 
<br>exacerbating the situation, Barak acknowledged Iran and 
<br>Pakistan are interconnected, but disagreed with a causal 
<br>chain. To the contrary, he argued that if the United States 
<br>had directly confronted North Korea in recent years, others 
<br>would be less inclined to pursue nuclear weapons programs. 
<br>By avoiding confrontation with Iran, Barak argued, the U.S. 
<br>faces a perception of weakness in the region. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (U) CODELS Casey and Ackerman did not have the 
<br>opportunity to clear this message.
