<br> 
<br>REF A: STATE 120288 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (U) This is an action request.  Please see 
<br>paragraphs 2-5. 
<br> 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) The United States, along with its partners, has 
<br>made an unprecedented effort to engage Iran in an effort 
<br>to diplomatically resolve the international community's 
<br>concerns with Iran's nuclear program.  Iran's lack of 
<br>constructive response so far, and its continued 
<br>reluctance to cooperate with international efforts to 
<br>build confidence and transparency in its nuclear 
<br>program, demand a response.  Department requests posts 
<br>to draw on the attached narrative to explain our 
<br>rationale for why  sharpening the choice that Iran 
<br>faces, by increasing pressure, is necessary at this 
<br>point, and to secure the cooperation of host governments 
<br>in these efforts.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>OBJECTIVES 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) FOR ALL POSTS (except Moscow, Paris, Beijing, 
<br>London and Berlin): Please draw on narrative beginning 
<br>in paragraph 11 to: 
<br> 
<br>-- Highlight U.S. efforts to mobilize diplomatic 
<br>engagement with Iran in 2009; 
<br> 
<br>-- Underscore the lack of a meaningful Iranian response 
<br>to those efforts, especially since the P5+1 political 
<br>directors meeting with Iran in Geneva on October 1, 
<br>2009; 
<br> 
<br>-- Outline U.S. view of next steps, including increasing 
<br>pressure on Iran; and 
<br> 
<br>-- Seek enhanced bilateral cooperation to increase 
<br>pressure. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) FOR MOSCOW, PARIS, BEIJING, LONDON, AND BERLIN: 
<br>Posts may share the general tenor of our message but do 
<br>not need to deploy the points themselves with host 
<br>governments. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Points should be deployed by Ambassadors to most 
<br>appropriate senior counterparts.  Posts may not leave 
<br>any part of this message in writing with host 
<br>governments. 
<br> 
<br>DEADLINE 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (U) Posts should report any substantive response to 
<br>their efforts by February 3.  Elisa Catalano (NEA/FO, 
<br>catalanoe@state.sgov.gov, 647-9533) and Richard Nephew 
<br>(ISN/RA, nephewrm@state.sgov.gov, 647-7680) are the 
<br>Department's POCs. 
<br> 
<br>BACKGROUND 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (SBU) With its P5+1 partners, the U.S. has been 
<br>pursuing a policy towards Iran that includes engagement 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00009124  002 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>and incentives, as well as pressure.  Since the 1 
<br>October 2009 meeting of the P5+1 Political Directors and 
<br>representatives from Iran, the United States has been 
<br>working closely with its partners to engage with Iran to 
<br>build international confidence in the peaceful nature of 
<br>its nuclear program.  Based on the agreement in 
<br>principle reached with Iran in Geneva, we have focused 
<br>on supporting the IAEA's proposal for refueling the 
<br>Tehran Research Reactor (TRR), facilitating the IAEA's 
<br>investigation of the previously clandestine uranium 
<br>enrichment plant at Qom, and pressing for a follow-on 
<br>meeting between P5+1 Political Directors and Iranian 
<br>representatives explicitly on Iran's nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) The results since October 1 have been 
<br>disappointing.  Iran has not accepted the IAEA's TRR 
<br>proposal; instead, Iran has rejected a series of updated 
<br>and more flexible proposals from the IAEA and our 
<br>partners on some terms of the proposal (REF A), and has 
<br>offered a substantially different counterproposal which 
<br>fails to address the concerns about its nuclear program, 
<br>does not fulfill the objective of building confidence in 
<br>Iran's nuclear intentions, and, as EU High 
<br>Representative Lady Ashton described, in effect rejects 
<br>the IAEA's proposal.  Iran has also announced its intent 
<br>to expand its nuclear program, including its intention 
<br>to start enriching uranium to higher levels to make its 
<br>own TRR fuel if its terms are not accepted on the fuel 
<br>deal.  Although Iran granted IAEA access to the facility 
<br>at Qom, its cooperation was limited and there remain 
<br>serious questions about Iran's intentions for the 
<br>facility, which is in open defiance of five UN Security 
<br>Council resolutions.  Finally, Iran to date has gone 
<br>back on its earlier commitment to meet again with the 
<br>P5+1 to discuss its nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (SBU) Former IAEA Director General El-Baradei 
<br>released his latest report on Iran on November 16, 2009, 
<br>and the IAEA Board of Governors (BoG) adopted a 
<br>resolution on Iran on November 27, 2009.  The resolution 
<br>notes the Board of Governors' serious concern that Iran 
<br>continues to defy the requirements and obligations 
<br>contained in UNSC resolutions and IAEA resolutions.  The 
<br>Board of Governors also expressed its serious concern 
<br>that contrary to the request of the Board of Governors 
<br>and requirements of the UN Security Council, Iran has 
<br>neither implemented the Additional Protocol nor provided 
<br>the access necessary for the IAEA to provide assurance 
<br>as to the absence of additional undeclared nuclear 
<br>activities. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (U) President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and other 
<br>P5+1 leaders identified the end of 2009 as a key period 
<br>for assessing Iran's responsiveness.  While the offer of 
<br>engagement remains on the table, we have begun to work 
<br>with partners to prepare new measures to increase 
<br>pressure on Iran. 
<br> 
<br>DIPLOMATIC POLICY NARRATIVE 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (U)  Begin talking points: 
<br> 
<br>Overview: Where We've Been, and Where We Are 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>-- The President made clear his readiness to open a new 
<br>page in our relations with Iran, based on mutual 
<br>respect. This new approach featured our offer to engage 
<br>Iran directly, as well as our readiness to become a full 
<br>and active participant in the P5+1's efforts to resolve 
<br>international concerns about Iran's nuclear program 
<br>through negotiations. 
<br> 
<br>-- We stated clearly our support for Iran's right to the 
<br>peaceful uses of nuclear energy provided Iran meets its 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00009124  003 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>international obligations and carries out its 
<br>responsibilities within the NPT framework. 
<br> 
<br>-- When we met with the Iranian delegation in Geneva on 
<br>October 1, along with our P5+1 partners, we sought 
<br>Iran's commitment to three concrete actions, which would 
<br>demonstrate its intentions for its nuclear program: 
<br> 
<br>--  support the IAEA's proposal for refueling the 
<br>Tehran Research Reactor; 
<br> 
<br>--  facilitate the IAEA's full investigation of the 
<br>previously clandestine uranium enrichment plant at 
<br>Qom; 
<br> 
<br>--  agree to a follow-on meeting between P5+1 
<br>Political Directors and Iranian representatives by 
<br>the end of October, explicitly focused on nuclear 
<br>issues but also open to discussion of any issues 
<br>raised by any party. 
<br>-- Each of these agreed actions presented Iran with an 
<br>important opportunity to begin to assure the 
<br>international community about its intentions for its 
<br>nuclear program and to pursue together a diplomatic 
<br>resolution to our differences. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran has not followed through on any of these three 
<br>commitments. 
<br> 
<br>-- President Obama also stated last year that we would 
<br>continually assess Iran's responsiveness to these 
<br>offers, and that the end of the year would present a key 
<br>period of assessment. 
<br> 
<br>-- It is increasingly clear that Iran has not taken 
<br>advantage of the opportunities we have offered. 
<br> 
<br>-- A year into the Obama administration, Iran has not 
<br>taken practical, concrete steps that would begin to 
<br>create confidence in its nuclear intentions.  Iran: 
<br> 
<br>--  Continues to enrich uranium despite UNSC 
<br>requirements that it suspend such operations; 
<br> 
<br>--  Revealed it had been building a secret uranium 
<br>enrichment facility at a military base near Qom, in 
<br>violation of its safeguards agreement and UN 
<br>Security Council resolutions; 
<br> 
<br>--  Continues to refuse cooperation with the IAEA 
<br>in addressing the full range of IAEA questions 
<br>about the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program; 
<br> 
<br>--  Has not accepted the IAEA proposal to refuel 
<br>the TRR, which was a response to an Iranian 
<br>request, despite U.S. and our partners' significant 
<br>efforts to be flexible and address Iranian concerns 
<br>with the deal; and 
<br> 
<br>--  Since meeting with representatives of the five 
<br>permanent members of the Security Council and 
<br>Germany in Geneva on October 1, has refused all 
<br>subsequent efforts to schedule another meeting to 
<br>discuss its nuclear program. 
<br> 
<br>--  Iran has not been able to say "yes" to a balanced 
<br>IAEA proposal that would provide fuel for its Tehran 
<br>Research Reactor and begin to build mutual trust and 
<br>confidence, notably by transferring 1,200kgs of its low 
<br>enriched uranium abroad as an indication of Iran's 
<br>peaceful nuclear intent. 
<br> 
<br>--  Underscoring the significance of the IAEA's TRR 
<br>proposal, in November 2009, former IAEA DG ElBaradei 
<br>said that the proposal had "extensive built-in 
<br>guarantees...the Russians are guaranteeing implementation. 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00009124  004 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>The Americans are ready for the first time to guarantee 
<br>the implementation.  The [IAEA] will take custody of 
<br>Iran's material so the international community as a 
<br>whole will guarantee" implementation. 
<br> 
<br>--  On Iran's desire to retain possession of its nuclear 
<br>material under delivery of the fuel (which is the basis 
<br>of Iran's counterproposal), Dr. ElBaradei rejected this 
<br>approach, saying publicly in November after Iran first 
<br>raised this idea that this would "defeat the whole 
<br>purpose of the IAEA's agreement...this is not a 
<br>solution."; 
<br> 
<br>--  While it allowed IAEA inspectors to visit its newly 
<br>revealed enrichment site near Qom, it did not provide 
<br>the IAEA with the full access the organization 
<br>requested, notably by agreeing to the IAEA's request for 
<br>access to specific Iranian nuclear officials and 
<br>answering IAEA questions regarding the history and 
<br>purpose of the facility.  The clandestine construction 
<br>of this facility was inconsistent with Iran's IAEA 
<br>Safeguards Agreement, and is in open defiance of UN 
<br>Security Council resolutions. 
<br> 
<br>--  As the IAEA reported in November 2009, Iran 
<br>continues to develop its nuclear program regardless of 
<br>international concerns and IAEA, NPT, and UNSC 
<br>requirements - most starkly in its construction of a 
<br>secret uranium enrichment facility at a military base 
<br>near Qom.  As former Director General El-Baradei's 
<br>report on November 16 outlines, this facility and the 
<br>circumstances surrounding it raises the persistent 
<br>question of additional such undeclared facilities. 
<br> 
<br>--  The IAEA report makes clear that Iran has failed to 
<br>cooperate fully and transparently with the IAEA, 
<br>answering questions about the use of this facility and 
<br>the possibility of other facilities. 
<br> 
<br>--  Iran has failed to take advantage of the creative 
<br>TRR proposal, engage with us constructively on other 
<br>elements of its nuclear program, and cooperate fully 
<br>with the IAEA.  It also still defies UNSC requirements 
<br>that it suspend its enrichment program, instead 
<br>announcing an expansion of its nuclear program.  Even 
<br>more, it is threatening to begin enriching its LEU to 
<br>higher levels of enrichment if the international 
<br>community does not accept a TRR deal on its terms, terms 
<br>that would not build confidence as they would reduce and 
<br>delay transfers of LEU from Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--  Iran's continued nuclear activities and its refusal 
<br>to engage meaningfully with the international community 
<br>risks a possible arms race in the region and undermines 
<br>the global international nonproliferation regime as a 
<br>whole. 
<br> 
<br>--  As you know, Israel has stated that an Iran with 
<br>nuclear weapons poses a great threat to its security and 
<br>that it reserves the right to defend itself.  We believe 
<br>Iran's continued non-compliance with its international 
<br>obligations regarding its nuclear program poses serious 
<br>threats to stability in the region.  Presenting Iran 
<br>with a united global front is the best avenue to resolve 
<br>the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic means. 
<br> 
<br>--  In addition to its disregard of its nuclear-related 
<br>obligations, Iran continues to support terrorist 
<br>organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, and militant 
<br>groups in Iraq.  It also provides some support to the 
<br>Taliban to facilitate attacks against ISAF forces in 
<br>Afghanistan. 
<br> 
<br>--  Also of deep concern to the international community 
<br>is the dramatic uptick in repression inside Iran.  As 
<br>Secretary Clinton said recently, we are deeply disturbed 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00009124  005 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>by the ruthless repression that Iran is exercising 
<br>against its citizens who seek to exercise their 
<br>universal right to free expression and assembly. 
<br> 
<br>The Pressure Aspect of the Strategy: Making the Case 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br> 
<br>--  The two elements of the P5+1 strategy - 
<br>engagement/incentives and pressure -- were always 
<br>intended to run in parallel, because without a credible 
<br>threat of consequences, it is unlikely that Iran will 
<br>make a strategic or even tactical change in direction. 
<br> 
<br>--  For that reason, we have always recognized the 
<br>possibility that we would need to increase pressure to 
<br>sharpen the choice that Iran faces in order to persuade 
<br>Iran that the international community is serious. 
<br> 
<br>--  Still, our emphasis over the course of this year has 
<br>been on outreach and engagement rather than pressure. 
<br>Unfortunately, to date, Iran has failed to respond 
<br>constructively. 
<br> 
<br>--  Pressure is not an end in itself; it is a means to 
<br>encourage Iran to recalculate costs and benefits, and to 
<br>return to a course of constructive engagement at the 
<br>negotiating table.  But without unmistakable and 
<br>meaningful consequences, there seems little prospect for 
<br>such a return. 
<br> 
<br>--  The international community has already imposed 
<br>strict measures on Iran via various multilateral fora to 
<br>demonstrate that Iran cannot ignore its responsibilities 
<br>without cost.  We believe a more aggressive enforcement 
<br>of this existing and robust international framework, 
<br>along with the application of significant additional 
<br>pressure, will illustrate to Iran the sharp choices it 
<br>faces should it continue to rebuff efforts to resolve 
<br>our differences diplomatically. 
<br> 
<br>--  Unity among members of the international community 
<br>is absolutely essential to demonstrate to Iran that 
<br>there are serious consequences for its continued refusal 
<br>to engage constructively with the international 
<br>community over its nuclear program.  Such unity was 
<br>clear when the IAEA Board of Governors adopted its Iran 
<br>resolution in November. It was also clear in the 
<br>European Council's declaration on Iran issued in 
<br>December.  Both were useful and immediate opportunities 
<br>to increase pressure on Iran. 
<br> 
<br>--  We believe Iran's continued non-compliance regarding 
<br>its nuclear program deserves the full and urgent 
<br>attention of the international community. 
<br> 
<br>Next Steps 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>-- We stand behind our offer to engage with Iran, but we 
<br>are rapidly approaching the moment when we will have to 
<br>give full meaning to all elements of our strategy.  We, 
<br>along with our partners, believe that the time has come 
<br>to increase pressure on Iran.  Such pressure is 
<br>necessary to uphold the integrity of the UNSC and IAEA, 
<br>and demonstrate that continued non-compliance has 
<br>consequences. 
<br> 
<br>-- The U.S. believes that multilateral pressure would be 
<br>best achieved through new UN Security Council action and 
<br>swift implementation of that action. 
<br> 
<br>-- However, UN action alone may not be sufficient to 
<br>persuade Iran to change course.  There is much more that 
<br>can and should be done immediately to implement measures 
<br>already required under the existing international 
<br>sanctions framework.  We therefore ask our partners to 
<br> 
<br>STATE 00009124  006 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>ensure that we are collectively enforcing all those 
<br>measures that are already in place as comprehensively as 
<br>possible. 
<br> 
<br>-- We regret that Iran has missed repeated opportunities 
<br>for meaningful engagement.  Our intent is not to 
<br>escalate a conflict, but to press for a diplomatic 
<br>resolution.  Inaction is what the Iranians are hoping 
<br>for, as they draw closer to achieving a nuclear weapons 
<br>capability. 
<br> 
<br>-- On January 16, we and our P5+1 partners met to take 
<br>stock and discuss next steps regarding Iran.  As the 
<br>Chair's statement reflects, we agreed that Iran has 
<br>failed to follow up on the key understandings reached in 
<br>our meeting with the Iranian delegation on October 1, 
<br>¶2009.  We are united and remain committed to our 
<br>approach - while we will continue to seek a negotiated 
<br>diplomatic solution, we believe it is time for 
<br>consideration of appropriate further measures. 
<br> 
<br>-- We are here today to intensify our consultations with 
<br>you, as one of our partners in the international 
<br>community, on next appropriate steps aimed to persuade 
<br>Iran to bring its nuclear program into full compliance 
<br>with its international obligations. 
<br> 
<br>-- We urge these steps with steady determination that we 
<br>must do everything we can, including applying greater 
<br>pressure, to encourage Iran to return to a constructive 
<br>course of engagement. 
<br> 
<br>FOR EU MEMBER STATES, USEU, AND TOKYO ONLY: 
<br> 
<br>-- As we move ahead with and beyond the UN process, we 
<br>also will want to work with you to agree on additional 
<br>actions we could take on a coordinated, national basis 
<br>to magnify the impact of a new Security Council 
<br>Resolution and demonstrate to Iran our seriousness of 
<br>purpose.
