<br>REF: A. EMBASSY PARIS DAILY SIPRNET REPORT FOR JANUARY 13 
<br>¶B. 2008 
<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>¶1. (U) In this annual New Year's message to the Diplomatic 
<br>Corps on delivered on January 18, President Sarkozy laid out 
<br>a theoretical justification for recasting France's role on 
<br>the international scene in the twin challenges before the 
<br>international community: climate change and the "return of 
<br>the religious extremism" as a factor in international 
<br>politics. Sarkozy called for "four innovations" to prevail 
<br>over these challenges: 1) returning France to the "heart of 
<br>the occidental family," 2) dedicating France to a "diplomacy 
<br>of reconciliation," 3) affirming "diversity" while demanding 
<br>"its corollary, reciprocity," and 4) working towards the 
<br>"construction of a world order adapted to the emergence of 
<br>new powers and therefore capable of dealing effectively with 
<br>the challenges of the 21st century." The specific 
<br>initiatives Sarkozy said France would be pursuing during the 
<br>coming year -- from reform of the UNSC to pressing for 
<br>continued sanctions against Iran, from expansion of the G-8 
<br>to the hosting of an Afghanistan donors' conference -- all 
<br>link to Sarkozy's projected role for France as leading the 
<br>way towards the international unity needed to meet the 
<br>environmental challenge to humanity from global warming and 
<br>the political challenge to secular democracy from religious 
<br>fundamentalists. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>NEW YEAR'S BEST WISHES TO THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>¶2. (U) President Nicolas Sarkozy delivered the French 
<br>president's annual New Year's best wishes to the Diplomatic 
<br>Corps on the afternoon of January 18. Ambassador Stapleton 
<br>and DCM Pekala attended the event -- remarks followed by 
<br>reception -- at the Elysee palace. Traditionally, French 
<br>presidents have used these events to review administration 
<br>achievements and to unveil or re-iterate upcoming foreign 
<br>policy initiatives. True to form, Sarkozy went beyond review 
<br>of achievements and listing of initiatives, and laid out the 
<br>justification for his projected reform of France's role on 
<br>the international scene. Sarkozy began by pointing out -- as 
<br>he does in connection with nearly every area of public policy 
<br>-- "I was not elected to accept things as they are. I was 
<br>elected to reform France through a continuous process of 
<br>profound reform." He also underlined that France's foreign 
<br>policy "had to stem from a lucid analysis, realistic about 
<br>France's place in the world as the world is today." 
<br>
<br>TWO GREAT CHALLENGES -- AND THE NEED FOR UNITY 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br>¶3. (U) Sarkozy's analysis of the state of the world today 
<br>posits two great challenges -- climate change and religious 
<br>fundamentalism. Sarkozy said that global warming's "menace 
<br>to humanity" and the intention of "certain groups to impose a 
<br>fundamentalist, hegemonic and intolerant" religiosity would 
<br>"restructure international society in the 21st century 
<br>possibly more than ideologies did in the 20th." Sarkozy then 
<br>argued that these challenges could be successfully met only 
<br>"on one condition" -- "finding the unity" necessary for 
<br>concerted, effective international action. The four major 
<br>"innovations" in France's international affairs posture that 
<br>Sarkozy then claimed he had or was putting in place, and the 
<br>range of specific initiatives that he said France would be 
<br>pursuing in the coming year link directly, in Sarkozy's view, 
<br>to fostering the international unity necessary for taking 
<br>effective action against these two challenges. COMMENT: In 
<br>his presentation to the members of the diplomatic corps 
<br>Sarkozy projected as a candidate on the campaign trail -- 
<br>working hard to win over his listeners to his way of looking 
<br>at things. As he has always done in connection with his 
<br>domestic reform campaigns, Sarkozy sets great store in 
<br>bringing people around to share his diagnosis of the 
<br>situation, from which follow the courses of action he 
<br>proposes. END COMMENT. 
<br>
<br>FOUR "INNOVATIONS" 
<br>------------------ 
<br>¶4. (U) The four foreign policy "innovations" Sarkozy claimed 
<br>to be implementing are: 1) returning France to the "heart of 
<br>her Occidental family," 2) pursuing a "diplomacy of 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000130 002.6 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>C O R R E C T E D C O P Y (ADDED TAGS) 
<br>
<br>conciliation," 3) affirming "diversity" while demanding that 
<br>"its corollary, reciprocity" be honored by others, and 4) 
<br>advocating a reformed international institutional order 
<br>"adapted to the emergence of new powers and therefore capable 
<br>of dealing effectively with the challenges of the 21st 
<br>century." While he rejected previous government's use of the 
<br>word "hyperpower" to describe the U.S., he did describe a 
<br>multi-polar worldview with Europe become one of the active 
<br>poles. 
<br>
<br>¶5. In connection with the first, he evoked France's 
<br>new-found closeness to the U.S. Sarkozy underlined that 
<br>France was a "voluntary partner" of the U.S., and an 
<br>"independent ally and friend," while clearly implying that 
<br>France, for the sake of its own effectiveness and 
<br>credibility, was right to abandon its pretensions to 
<br>representing an alternative to U.S. leadership. Sarkozy also 
<br>underlined, inQnection with France's getting back in step 
<br>with the major western democracies, that doing so was key to 
<br>advancing France's leadership role in the EU. He said that 
<br>"it was France's ambition to see the EU emerge as an 
<br>important global actor in the 21st century," and that that 
<br>required "the development of an effective European defense" 
<br>capability (ESDP) independent of NATO. He stressed that, in 
<br>the face of today's "range of threats and crises" NATO and 
<br>ESDP were complimentary spans of a single security and 
<br>defense architecture for Europe. He said that France's 
<br>new-found unity with the U.S. and new-found unity with its EU 
<br>partners had reinforced France's leadership credibility both 
<br>"internally," among the western democracies, and 
<br>"externally," throughout the rest of the world. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) Sarkozy argued that France's "diplomacy of 
<br>conciliation" worked to attenuate differences, and, by 
<br>implication, promote the unity necessary for effective 
<br>international action. Sarkozy justified his recent dealings 
<br>with Qadhafi and Hugo Chavez in terms of this constructive 
<br>engagement, French-style, that he calls "diplomacy of 
<br>conciliation." He went on to say that France's foreign 
<br>policies would henceforth be anchored in the affirmation of 
<br>"diversity, and its corollary, reciprocity." He justified 
<br>the elevation of "diversity" to a guiding principle for 
<br>foreign policies as follows, "Even more than the fight for 
<br>democracy, it seems to me that the fight for diversity -- for 
<br>openness, tolerance, acceptance of others in all their 
<br>difference -- is fundamental. It is, in a way, the 
<br>precondition for extending liberty and durably implanting 
<br>democracy." Lastly, Sarkozy claimed the "innovation" of 
<br>advocating a reformed system of multi-lateral institutions, 
<br>and again justified these proposals as necessary for 
<br>achieving needed unity in the face of global challenges. 
<br>
<br>SPECIFIC INITIATIVES 
<br>------------------- 
<br>¶7. (U) Once he had dispatched the carefully constructed 
<br>theoretical underpinnings of his framework for France's 
<br>foreign policy, Sarkozy took up the range of specific 
<br>initiatives that France would be pursuing in the coming year. 
<br>NOTE: Sarkozy's speech, in its entirety, is available, in 
<br>English, on the Elysee website at www.elysee.fr; in addition, 
<br>post has reported separately (ref) on the outlook for 
<br>France's Africa policy as reflected in the speech; 
<br>furthermore, French policy under Sarkozy in the critical 
<br>areas of Iran, Afghanistan, NATO/ESDP, and Middle East Peace 
<br>have the subject of extensive and regular reporting. END 
<br>NOTE. Among the most salient of Sarkozy's specific 
<br>initiatives aimed at reforming international institutions are 
<br>enlarging the Security Council in its two categories of 
<br>members, and enlarging the G-8 to include, "progressively" 
<br>China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. In addition, 
<br>Sarkozy called for reform of the IMF, calling on it to become 
<br>more inclusive of emerging economic powers and to develop a 
<br>way of engaging the large international oil and other 
<br>similarly profitable global companies, in financing the 
<br>alleviation of poverty. He also said that "all must be done" 
<br>to produce an agreement by 2009 up to the "colossal challenge 
<br>of global warming via the Bali process." 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) He reiterated France's commitment to continuing 
<br>sanctions against Iran, while aiming to return Iran to full 
<br>respectability "once it respects international law." Sarkozy 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000130 003.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>confirmed that France would host the next Afghanistan donors 
<br>conference. He said France would support "the process 
<br>envisaged at Annapolis" to result "in the creation of a 
<br>Palestinian State side-by-side to the State of Israel." He 
<br>reviewed France's priorities for its upcoming presidency of 
<br>the EU -- the Lisbon treaty, the environment and energy, 
<br>immigration, agriculture, and implementing ESDP -- and he 
<br>recommitted to "launching that important civilizational 
<br>project," the Mediterranean Union. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>¶9. (U) In this speech, Sarkozy did not unveil any new or 
<br>unexpected initiatives, but he did attempt to link France's 
<br>foreign policy initiatives to pressing international problems 
<br>without referring to "France's glory" or "France's history 
<br>and civilization". Sarkozy nevertheless articulated an 
<br>ambitious foreign policy framework that should help guide our 
<br>understand of the French approach over the coming months 
<br>including during its Presidency of the European Union that 
<br>begins in July. END COMMENT.<br>
