<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Leading Russian sociologists concur the GOR missed the 
<br>chance to invest in the middle class during the economic 
<br>boom. As a result, the middle class remains only 
<br>approximately 20 percent of the population. That said, 
<br>experts assert that the small middle class is nonetheless 
<br>well positioned to weather the current crisis owing to its 
<br>savings and human capital. Moreover, they see the middle 
<br>class less as a revolutionary class than an inert mass, 
<br>inclined to support the administration. Neither sociologists 
<br>nor the administration consider the middle class a threat to 
<br>the regime, even in the throes of an economic downturn. As 
<br>such, the government has decided to focus its anti-crisis 
<br>resources on blue-collar workers instead of providing the 
<br>support and institutional reform needed for middle class 
<br>development -- and ultimately the innovation economy that 
<br>Medvedev and Putin advocate. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>MIDDLE CLASS SURVIVING, BUT NOT THRIVING 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) During last month's annual conference on the 
<br>sociopolitical challenges of the 21st century, sponsored by 
<br>the Independent Institute for Social Politics (ISP), panels 
<br>of sociologists and economists, many of whom advise President 
<br>Medvedev, said the Russian middle class would survive the 
<br>economic crisis but would not thrive. Igor Yurgens, of the 
<br>Institute for Modern Development, opened the conference by 
<br>underscoring the GOR's neglect of investment in the public 
<br>and social institutions necessary to nurture the middle class 
<br>during the eight year economic boom that coincided with Prime 
<br>Minister Putin's presidency. The opportunities provided by 
<br>massive petrodollar inflows were now gone, he stated. Owing 
<br>to the government's failure to capitalize on these 
<br>opportunities and the reversal in Russia's economic fortunes, 
<br>the vertical impetus for social mobility had stopped 
<br>functioning. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX, further  stressed the lack of
<br>quantitative middle class growth in  spite of Russia's
<br>economic prosperity. She used studies from  2000 and 
<br>2007 to demonstrate that the size of the middle  class
<br>remained relatively constant, at anywhere from 12 to 20 
<br>percent of the population. By her estimate, the core of the 
<br>middle class was between 5-7 percent of the population, 
<br>although by lowering the income standards and the standard 
<br>set for social and professional status, the middle class 
<br>would then range between 12-20 percent of the population. In 
<br>her calculations, the middle class was made up primarily of 
<br>managers of large companies, bank directors, financial 
<br>specialists, business owners (restaurants, retail trade), 
<br>part of the intelligentsia, and middle to high-level 
<br>bureaucrats. The latter category had grown during the crisis 
<br>(owing to the slowdown in the private sector), and she said, 
<br>now comprised about a quarter of the middle class. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>GETTING THROUGH THE CRISIS 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) During a separate meeting with us, XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>claimed  that the fall in real incomes, not job losses, was now the 
<br>biggest threat to middle class prosperity. XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>estimated  that middle class incomes would shrink this year by
<br>10 to 15  percent with a negative GDP growth rate of 3.5 percent.
<br>(In  comparison middle class incomes dropped by 25 percent during 
<br>the 1998 crisis). She added that the "core" of the middle 
<br>class had actually contracted slightly, from 6.9 to 5.3 
<br>percent, which she said was probably due to the fact that a 
<br>number of white collar workers (bankers, managers, as well as 
<br>small and medium sized entrepreneurs) had fallen out of the 
<br>middle class since the beginning of the crisis. She 
<br>contended, however, that the employment situation with the 
<br>middle class had for the most part stabilized. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX commented that the middle
<br>class had certain  "cushions" which gave it an advantage
<br>over the blue collar, or poorer classes during the crisis.
<br>First of all, many of the middle class had accumulated
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000821 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>savings during the boom  years (comprising between seven to
<br>10 percent of their total  incomes, or the equivalent of four or
<br>five monthly salaries).  Between October 2008 and February
<br>2009, they tended to take  advantage of the GOR's gradual
<br>devaluation to purchase foreign exchange, trade it for rubles,
<br> and then purchase  large consumer items and durables, such
<br>as automobiles and  refrigerators, which were priced in rubles.
<br> She said as of February, however, the middle class "consumer binge"
<br>had  pretty much run its course owing to the decline in real 
<br>incomes, depletion of personal savings, and persistent 
<br>inflation. 
<br>
<br>----------------- 
<br>NOT REVOLUTIONARY 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Despite claims by political activists like Garry 
<br>Kasparov that the middle class will create "problems" for the 
<br>administration when job cuts start and salaries freeze, most 
<br>sociologists here portray the middle class as a conservative 
<br>force rather than a potentially disgruntled constituency 
<br>eager to defend its interests. XXXXXXXXXXXX argued
<br>the number of "entrepreneurs" within the  middle class had
<br>not grown during the Putin years. He  claimed virtually all
<br>of the growth had come instead from the rise of government
<br>bureaucrats who benefited from impressive  pay increases
<br>under Putin. As a result, the mentality of the  middle class
<br>has shifted considerably away from the more 
<br>independent and market-oriented conceptions of the 
<br>Yeltsin-era (in which entrepreneurial types dominated). 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) During the Putin era, Russia has developed what 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  termed a "third world" middle class
<br>with a  conservative mentality, shaped by hierarchical thinking,
<br>and  largely risk averse. Indeed, according to his research,
<br>the  core of the middle class has now absorbed much of the 
<br>bureaucratic worldview of the majority. This explains the 
<br>broad support for Putin and Medvedev across society, the 
<br>power of social conservative values, and a reluctance to 
<br>challenge authority. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Paradoxically, Russia's youthful middle class is more 
<br>Western in its lifestyle, but still very anti-Western in its 
<br>politics, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX. She sees Russia's
<br>young "social innovators"  (her company eschews the term
<br>"middle class" as too  controversial) as characterized by a more
<br>Western lifestyle, including the willingness to take bank loans,
<br>use the  internet, pay for fitness centers, etc. Their better 
<br>education makes them mentally more flexible but does not make 
<br>them more politically liberal. Far from afraid of the 
<br>economic downturn, most are confident that their abilities 
<br>allow them to re-invent themselves and adapt to challenges. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX  commented to us that today's 
<br>youth are firmly  indoctrinated in a "patriotic" mindset that
<br>blames the US and  the West for much of Russia's ills.
<br>They remain largely  apolitical, but more attuned to the
<br>interests of the state,  rather than the rights and opportunities
<br>of the individual.  As such, he sees Russia's youth as more inclined
<br>to rally in  defense of the state than to agitate for revolutionary
<br>change. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>MIDDLE CLASS WELL POSITIONED, BUT LACKS SUPPORT 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) That said, XXXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>told us in separate meetings that the middle  class still had the best
<br>chance of stimulating Russia's  development in the post-crisis world.
<br> It had invested more in its own human capital (education and training)
<br>during the high growth years; whereas the lower socio-economic strata 
<br>used most of their new-found cash to purchase basic consumer  items.
<br>In addition, the middle class had acquired work experience and 
<br>professional skills enabling them to adapt to shifts in labor market
<br>demand. Blue-collar households, in contrast, were suffering
<br>disproportionately from inflation,  down-sizing, and salary 
<br>reductions. XXXXXXXXXXXX  concluded the middle class
<br>would be the best candidate for supporting collaboration
<br>between the state, society, and  private sector to address
<br>Russia's economic problems. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) However, these analysts pointed out that the GOR's 
<br>focus on blue-collar workers in its anti-crisis measures had 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00000821 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>deprived the middle class of resources and opportunities to 
<br>stimulate growth or reform. According to Tambovtsev, the 
<br>main hope for middle class to play a transitional role in 
<br>society lay in small business entrepreneurship. 
<br>Unfortunately, the absence of secure property and contract 
<br>rights, a biased judiciary, and administrative barriers 
<br>impeded SME growth. Falling consumption was also hurting 
<br>SME's, which tended to orient themselves toward household 
<br>consumers. Without the resources and institutional reforms 
<br>necessary to improve their productivity, middle class 
<br>entrepreneurs were unlikely to serve as a strong 
<br>countermeasure to current economic trends. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) While not dead, the Russian middle class does not 
<br>show signs of rapid growth in the near term, nor does it seem 
<br>likely to be the engine of democratic change in Russia. 
<br>Better equipped to deal with the downturn than the working 
<br>classes but politically inert, the middle class poses little 
<br>threat to political and social stability. Moreover, despite 
<br>the administration's emphasis on preparing for post-crisis 
<br>development through innovation and small/medium businesses, 
<br>the most likely candidate to help the government achieve 
<br>those aims -- the middle class -- has largely been ignored by 
<br>the state. We expect this process to continue: budget 
<br>constraints will leave minimal resources for cultivating the 
<br>human capital of the middle class. End Comment.
