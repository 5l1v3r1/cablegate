<br>SUBJECT: U.S.-FRANCE-EU DISCUSS SAHEL SECURITY ISSUES 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: U.S. government representatives met 
<br>French, British, and European Union officials on 
<br>September 10 in Paris to review efforts to address the 
<br>security threat posed by terrorism in Africa's Sahel and 
<br>Maghreb regions. There was broad agreement that the USG, 
<br>France, and other third countries should identify areas of 
<br>cooperation and mechanisms to coordinate and de-conflict 
<br>efforts to improve multilateral and individual country 
<br>capacity in the region to address immediate and long-term 
<br>threats from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The 
<br>discussions focused on factors influencing the region's 
<br>ability to address the AQIM threat, including the Sahel 
<br>countries' lack of law enforcement and military capacity; the 
<br>complexity of state relations with its nomadic populations, 
<br>e.g. the Tuareg and Berbiche ethnic groups, the profitability 
<br>of illicit trade and kidnapping networks; the need for 
<br>Algeria to work more closely with its neighbors; the 
<br>importance of better donor coordination; and undermining 
<br>recruitment efforts that could expand the scope of radical 
<br>Islam in West and Central Africa. Participants agreed on the 
<br>need to meet in the future to exchange information regarding 
<br>each other's efforts in region. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs 
<br>Johnnie Carson led a high-level interagency delegation in 
<br>discussions with a French delegation led by Under Secretary 
<br>for Political Affairs (P)-equivalent Policy Director Jacques 
<br>Audibert and Africa A/S-equivalent Stephane Gompertz. The 
<br>U.S. and French delegations were joined by British and 
<br>European Union counterparts for the afternoon session. The 
<br>discussion began with an exchange of information on the 
<br>current security and political situation in the Sahel, which 
<br>Gompertz described as France's "main area of concern" in 
<br>sub-Saharan Africa and was followed by exchanges on a wide 
<br>range of critical factors related to the region's terrorist 
<br>threat. Martin Julliard, France's Head of Transnational 
<br>Threats Section, Strategic and Security Affairs Department at 
<br>the MFA, said that AQIM's political agenda was not well 
<br>understood and was evolving over time. He noted that AQIM is 
<br>targeting westerners, but it was not clear whether it wanted 
<br>to challenge the legitimacy of governments or even the 
<br>states. Participants noted that while AQIM's northern group 
<br>remains concentrated on Algeria, elements of the southern 
<br>group have shifted away from acting primarily as logistical 
<br>support for northern operations and have increased planning 
<br>and operations in the Sahel. It was emphasized that the 
<br>southern group remained linked with its northern leadership, 
<br>but has made inroads in recruiting in the Sahel, particularly 
<br>in Mauritania, and has increased the scope and sophistication 
<br>of its operations in parts of the Sahel during the past year. 
<br>USG and French participants considered whether there were 
<br>opportunities to exploit apparent divisions within AQIM. 
<br>Remi Marechaux, an Africa Advisor to President Sarkozy summed 
<br>up the situation succinctly, "we feel we are losing the 
<br>battle between improved development in these countries and 
<br>the increasing security threats in the region." 
<br>
<br>LACK OF CAPACITY 
<br>---------------- 
<br>¶3. (SBU) There was broad agreement among the participants 
<br>that the focus countries of the conference (Mauritania, Mali, 
<br>and Niger) lack the resources to fully control their vast 
<br>territories. In addition, lack of governmental capacity 
<br>remains a serious hindrance in terms of military/security 
<br>effectiveness and developmental progress. The EU chair noted 
<br>that each country posed specific challenges for partners in 
<br>addressing security threats: 
<br>
<br>-- Mali, where in addition to capacity constraints, there are 
<br>questions about the government's willingness to confront and 
<br>engage AQIM militarily, despite clear indications that AQIM 
<br>maintains a degree of impunity within its Northern Mali 
<br>"sanctuaries." S/CT Coordinator Daniel Benjamin noted that 
<br>Mali is perhaps becoming more helpful, but French speakers 
<br>consistently referred to the Malian position as "ambiguous" 
<br>and "enigmatic;" 
<br>
<br>-- Mauritania, which may possess greater political will for 
<br>taking-on AQIM, but political instability following the 
<br>recent coup hampered efforts to support its CT efforts; and 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001339 002 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- Niger, where recent un-democratic maneuvering by 
<br>President Tandja makes it difficult to offer new assistance. 
<br>NSC Senior Advisor Michelle Gavin underscored that our CT 
<br>efforts cannot undercut our governance and democracy 
<br>priorities in Africa. While remarking that President Tandja 
<br>had already "won his gamble" to secure a third term and the 
<br>French will focus their attention on pushing for credible 
<br>elections, Gompertz stated that France did not have a clear 
<br>strategy to balance its CT objectives with the urgency of 
<br>promoting good governance and constitutional rule in the 
<br>country. 
<br>
<br>PROFITS FROM ILLICIT TRADE AND KIDNAPPING 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (SBU) France's MOD Director of Strategic Affairs Pascal 
<br>Texeira noted that AQIM is commonly understood to have only 
<br>about 150 fighters in the Sahel, but it has significant 
<br>financial resources for obtaining weapons and logistic 
<br>support such as vehicles and radios from profitable illicit 
<br>trafficking networks, including arms, people, drugs, and 
<br>other contraband. Of even greater concern is AQIM's apparent 
<br>success in securing large ransom sums for kidnapped 
<br>westerners. When asked, U.K. FCO Director for Africa Adam 
<br>Wood confirmed that following the January murder of U.K. 
<br>hostage Edwin Dyer, his country would play a more active role 
<br>in the region, and would certainly support an AU initiative 
<br>at the UN to rally international opposition against ransom 
<br>payments in cases of piracy and hostage-taking, which he 
<br>believed was being spearheaded by Algeria. Participants had 
<br>not yet seen a draft of the resolution. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Developing a better understanding of Tuareg 
<br>activities and motivations was seen as an important priority, 
<br>especially since they develop ad-hoc agreements with AQIM 
<br>elements in support of trafficking and perhaps kidnapping. 
<br>Texeira stated that Mali views the threat of a new Tuareg 
<br>rebellion as more dangerous than that from AQIM, and neither 
<br>Mali nor Niger could count on Tuareg leaders to fight against 
<br>AQIM. French and USG analysts also noted that breakdowns in 
<br>traditional ethnic political, social and economic networks 
<br>was potentially destabilizing. 
<br>
<br>NEED TO INVOLVE ALGERIA 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>¶6. (SBU) A/S Carson raised the importance of getting 
<br>Algeria involved in multi-national efforts to combat AQIM, 
<br>and also for Algeria to work in concert directly with Mali to 
<br>disrupt AQIM and criminal networks. "There can be no 
<br>solution without Algeria," according to Texeira, who thought 
<br>that Algeria would work with regional partners, but did not 
<br>want to be implicated with "outside players." They noted 
<br>that Algeria engages in limited intelligence-sharing and has 
<br>made inquiries about other forms of counterterrorism 
<br>assistance, but remains reticent about enhanced cooperation 
<br>with potential western partners. 
<br>Participants viewed positively Algeria's plans to organize a 
<br>regional security summit in the coming months, but they 
<br>agreed that there was relatively little information about 
<br>summit objectives or the agenda. 
<br>
<br>TREAT OF SPREADING RADICALISM 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>¶7. (SBU) The potential spread of AQIM (or some other brand 
<br>of radicalized and violent Islam) in Africa was also a 
<br>recurring issue. In particular, participants expressed deep 
<br>concern that northern Nigeria is at risk of such influence. 
<br>AQIM personnel or facilitators had also reportedly been 
<br>identified in Niger and Senegal recently. Guinea-Bissau and 
<br>Guinea are also at risk should AQIM make greater inroads into 
<br>the West African narcotics trade, according to Gilles de 
<br>Kerchove, the European Union Council's Coordinator for 
<br>Counter Terrorism. Part of the problem is that 
<br>disenfranchised young men from the southern parts of the 
<br>Sahel are moving north and joining the group. 
<br>Participants agreed on the need for a greater understanding 
<br>of how AQIM successfully recruited militants/fighters/suicide 
<br>bombers, especially from 
<br>Mauritania. (Note: during a lunchtime conversation, 
<br>France's Ambassador to Mauritania explained to INR Analyst 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001339 003 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>Bernadette Graves and Embassy Paris Africa Watcher that he 
<br>sees no clear trend, nor does he understand the reasons for, 
<br>AQIM's apparent success in recruiting young Mauritanians. He 
<br>notes that these recruits have come from a variety of 
<br>backgrounds and ethnic groups and the trend does not fit the 
<br>commonly held view of Mauritania as a moderate, tolerant 
<br>Muslim country with Sufi traditions. End note.) 
<br>
<br>DONOR COORDINATION 
<br>------------------ 
<br>¶8. (SBU) One of the goals of the conference, and a recurring 
<br>theme, was to improve assistance co-ordination among donors. 
<br>The U.S., France, and the EU provide a range of military and 
<br>security training in the region. Assistant Secretary Carson 
<br>discussed the background and goals of the U.S. interagency 
<br>Trans-Saharan Counter Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP). He 
<br>noted that TSCTP was a broad-based holistic approach to 
<br>supporting regional CT efforts that includes military and law 
<br>enforcement capacity-building, public diplomacy/strategic 
<br>communications, and support for local and national good 
<br>governance. USAID Deputy Assistant Administrator Earl Gast 
<br>observed that development indicators in the Sahel are among 
<br>the worst in the world and USAID involvement in USG 
<br>counter-extremism programming reflects that the regional 
<br>vulnerability to terrorism is increased by the lack of 
<br>employment opportunities for youth and poor or nonexistent 
<br>governance and service delivery in large swaths of territory. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) France is focused on responding to Mali's request 
<br>to assist its efforts to establish four forward operating 
<br>bases in its northern frontier. It is also exploring how to 
<br>support efforts to improve Malian administration and local 
<br>governance in the north and improve customs and border 
<br>security. Gompertz stated that France has security dialogues 
<br>with Niger and Mali and would soon initiate discussions with 
<br>Mauritania. The French also highlighted the urgency of 
<br>assisting countries with judicial reform, training of 
<br>prosecutors and magistrates, and criminal procedures. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) The EU completed an assessment of Mali in July and 
<br>will visit Mauritania in October, but has postponed plans to 
<br>visit Niger due to the current political situation. Future 
<br>assistance may include border surveillance and customs 
<br>services, and Sweden's Ambassador for Counter Terrorism Carin 
<br>Wall highlighted the EU's desire to collaborate more closely 
<br>with other actors, "not least the U.S." 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) All three donors have or are considering programs 
<br>in judicial processes and law-enforcement. A/S Johnson 
<br>explained that the U.S. will likely establish a Regional 
<br>Security Training Center in West Africa, and the EU noted 
<br>that it is considering something similar: a Sahel-based 
<br>"multi-functional" regional training center focusing on 
<br>military, law enforcement, and border control and customs 
<br>capacity building. The EU and French representatives 
<br>highlighted the importance of building academies and 
<br>"clearinghouses" to provide training to a range of security 
<br>organs. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) The participants agreed to collect and share 
<br>detailed information about the specific programs and projects 
<br>each is pursuing or considering in the region as the first 
<br>step for further consultations and coordination. Towards the 
<br>end of the event, A/S Carson encouraged the participants to 
<br>find the time and means to expand this type of dialog into 
<br>other areas in need of greater mutual understanding and 
<br>coordination in Africa, including the way forward in Somalia, 
<br>Sudan, and the Great Lakes, and also for transboundary issues 
<br>such as demographic pressures, democracy, and development 
<br>priorities. A/S Johnson added judicial reform, including 
<br>best practices in corrections as another timely need. 
<br>
<br>"LEAD FROM THE SIDE" 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>¶13. (SBU) The three-plus groups agreed that supporting 
<br>regional CT efforts in the Sahel was an important immediate 
<br>and long-term priority, but there was a clear consensus that 
<br>external actors must ensure that they limit visibility of 
<br>their activities and avoid actions that would be seen as 
<br>undercutting regional leadership over the issue. Elysee 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00001339 004 OF 005 
<br>
<br>
<br>Advisor Marechaux noted that the French had not crafted a 
<br>"Sahel plan" in order to avoid a potential backlash from 
<br>Sahelian and Maghreb states suspicious of its intentions in 
<br>the region. He noted that increasing the "profile" of the 
<br>AQIM problem would likely enhance the group's Jihadist 
<br>"credentials" and attract potential recruits from inside and 
<br>outside the region. A/S Carson agreed: "We don,t want to 
<br>become part of the problem by appearing to take the lead; we 
<br>need to lead from the side, not from out front." He noted 
<br>that raising the profile of external actors in the region 
<br>risked alienating key Sahelian interlocutors and further 
<br>risked assisting AQIM recruiting and resourcing efforts. 
<br>Ambassador Benjamin agreed that it was vital to ensure that 
<br>the counterterrorism effort had a "local face." 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>¶14. (SBU) This gathering will likely prove the kick-off to 
<br>further discussions and closer cooperation. The French and 
<br>the EU reps were willing to share their analysis of the 
<br>situation, but were clearly also ready to defer to the U.S.'s 
<br>assessment. More than one French participant who later 
<br>joined a POL-hosted reception noted how impressed they were 
<br>with the high level of participation by the U.S. and by A/S 
<br>Carson's positive role as co-Chair of the event.
