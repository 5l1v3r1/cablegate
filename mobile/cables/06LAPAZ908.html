<br>SUBJECT: EVO'S POLITICAL ADVISERS (PART 3 OF 3) 
<br>
<br>REF: LA PAZ 00831 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Amb. David N. Greenlee for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: President Evo Morales keeps several close 
<br>advisers who facilitate and carry out his personal agenda but 
<br>have limited influence on the President's decisionmaking. 
<br>They are split between those who work behind the scenes to 
<br>facilitate Morales' vision and those who are charged with 
<br>intimidating the opposition, especially in Congress. This 
<br>cable is part three of a three-part series examining how 
<br>Morales has structured his advisory circle. End summary. 
<br>
<br>----------------- 
<br>Behind the Scenes 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S//NF) Morales has several behind-the-scenes operators 
<br>whose names rarely show up in open sources, but which 
<br>sensitive reporting indicates are key Morales advisers. They 
<br>appear to be loyal to Morales' political vision and work 
<br>closely with the Cubans and Venezuelans in a complementary 
<br>rather than competitive way, unlike Morales' primary 
<br>intellectual advisers (SEPTEL). (Comment: The fact that 
<br>these advisers work behind the scenes suggests that they are 
<br>not seeking public recognition, and Morales is more likely to 
<br>keep them around because of it. End comment.) 
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>Ivan Iporre Salguero 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S//NF) Ivan Iporre is Morales' personal assistant, and 
<br>sensitive reporting indicates that he also has been 
<br>responsible for Morales' personal finances. Iporre controls 
<br>Morales' agenda and access to him. He was one of three 
<br>advisers who accompanied Morales on his world tour in 
<br>January. Two Embassy contacts have said that Iporre is the 
<br>"go-to-guy" for seeking political favors from the President. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>Hugo Moldiz Mercado 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S//NF) Hugo Moldiz, a journalist by trade and a 
<br>well-known FARC and ELN-B contact, appears to hold an 
<br>unofficial advisory position in the Ministry of Government. 
<br>Sensitive reporting indicates that he has been an important 
<br>operator for Morales with the Cubans in Bolivia, particularly 
<br>coordinating the Constituent Assembly agenda and security and 
<br>intelligence issues. Press reports have also highlighted 
<br>Moldiz's role in allegedly organizing local self-defense 
<br>groups, a pet project Morales takes from his years as a 
<br>cocalero leader and may now be inspired by Venezuela's 
<br>President Hugo Chavez. 
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>Hector Arce Zaconeta 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Hector Arce is Morales' personal attorney, a position 
<br>he has held for six years. Arce appears to be responsible 
<br>for designing the legal means for Morales to bypass laws the 
<br>President deems inconvenient or for devising legal arguments 
<br>for harassing or attacking Morales' political adversaries, 
<br>such as the lawsuit against former President's Eduardo 
<br>Rodriguez, Carlos Mesa, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, and Jorge 
<br>Quiroga. 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>Public Operators 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Morales relies on several Congressmen, particularly 
<br>Senate President Santos Ramirez Valverde, Chamber of Deputies 
<br>President Edmundo Novillo Aguilar, and Chamber of Deputies 
<br>member Gustavo Torrico Landa, to intimidate opposition 
<br>
<br>LA PAZ 00000908 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>Congressional leaders. Ramirez, Novillo, and Torrico owe 
<br>their career to Morales and may be abusing power much like 
<br>their predecessors. In particular, Ramirez, a blatant 
<br>opportunist who one Embassy contact says would sell his 
<br>mother to get what he wants, has already fallen prey to 
<br>allegations of graft, according to PODEMOS Congressmen (REF 
<br>A). 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) These advisers operate more as the President's back 
<br>alley thugs than as independent legislators. For example, 
<br>PODEMOS Congressmen have told poloff that their MAS 
<br>counterparts have been digging up dirt from the past and 
<br>blackmailing opposition Congressmen to back the MAS or face 
<br>exposure through the press. (Comment: One Embassy contact 
<br>has referred to the Congressmen as part of the "Cochabamba 
<br>boys"--a reference to the group of associates that Morales 
<br>led over the years in the Chapare that regularly intimidated 
<br>and harassed cocaleros--although only Novillo technically 
<br>represents Cochabamba. End comment.) Further blurring the 
<br>line between the executive and legislative branches, the 
<br>press reported in January that both Ramirez and Novillo moved 
<br>into the presidential palace at Morales' request, although 
<br>Ramirez publicly denies that he lives there.
