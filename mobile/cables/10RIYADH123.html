<br> 
<br> SUMMARY: 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi met with King 
<br>Abdullah and FM Prince Saud Al-Faisal on January 13, during 
<br>the last stop of a five nation Africa and Middle East tour. 
<br>During the visit, FM Yang discussed deepening Saudi-Chinese 
<br>ties in a variety of fields, emphasizing trade, in 
<br>particular, with his Saudi counterparts.  Responding to 
<br>statements made by FM Saud, Yang also briefly discussed 
<br>Chinese support for Iraq, concern about Iranian nuclear 
<br>ambitions, and hopes for the Middle East Peace Process.  FM 
<br>Yang's foray into regional political commentary appears to 
<br>have been a result of FM Saud's prodding, both publicly and 
<br>behind closed doors, and is a reflection of the developing 
<br>Saudi-Chinese relationship. 
<br>END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>TRADE TAKES PRECEDENCE 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (U)  FM Yang arrived in Riyadh on January 13, the first 
<br>high-level visit since Chinese President Hu Jintao's February 
<br>2009 "Trip of Friendship and Cooperation."  FM Yang's visit 
<br>coincided with the 20th anniversary of Saudi-Chinese 
<br>diplomatic relations, and followed three days after Chinese 
<br>Trade Minister Chen Deming co-chaired the 4th session of the 
<br>Saudi-Chinese Joint Commission in Riyadh. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (U) The Chinese Foreign Minister has traditionally made 
<br>his first overseas trip of the new year to Africa, visiting 
<br>with African leaders and expressing Chinese goodwill and 
<br>improvements in trade relations.  This year, FM Yang extended 
<br>his visit to include not only major trading partners like 
<br>Nigeria, Kenya and Morocco, but also Saudi Arabia.  In a 
<br>January 13 statement to the press, FM Yang stressed the 
<br>importance of strengthening cooperation in "energy, 
<br>infrastructure, finance and science and 
<br>technology."  He said that both sides should carry out 
<br>cultural and education exchanges to deepen the bilateral 
<br>relationship and pressed the need for closer relations 
<br>between China and the GCC. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (U) These statements echoed similar announcements from 
<br>Chinese Trade Minister Chen who, in a January 10 press 
<br>conference, called for finalizing the Chinese-GCC free trade 
<br>agreement and increasing bilateral trade by 50%, from a total 
<br>annual value of $40 billion to $60 billion, over the next 
<br>five years (ref A).  During the Joint Commission meeting, 
<br>Saudi Minister of Finance Ibrahim Al-Assaf reportedly urged 
<br>the Chinese to participate in more joint ventures, noting 
<br>that while bilateral trade increased 25 times over the past 
<br>ten years, the two countries only have 19 joint projects. 
<br>Al-Assaf also welcomed China's 44 billion riyal ($11.7 
<br>billion) worth of infrastructure projects in the Kingdom. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>DUMPING CAUSES A BUMP 
<br>--------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) This call to increase Sino-Saudi trade comes on the 
<br>heels of a December 24 announcement that China would impose 
<br>anti-dumping tariffs of up to 13.6 percent on Saudi and 
<br>Taiwan-produced butanediol.  Beijing began a dumping probe on 
<br>methanol and butanediol (BDO) from Saudi Arabia in July, 
<br>which caused an unusually public trade spat between the two 
<br>countries (ref B).  Methanol and butanediol make up 10 to 15 
<br>percent of Saudi Arabia's $2 billion in annual non-oil 
<br>exports to China.  A Ministry of Commerce and Industry 
<br>official told Econoffs on January 13 that Saudi Arabia was 
<br>able to convince the Chinese not to impose tariffs on 
<br>methanol, but said the BDO case was still pending.  The 
<br>Ministry recently appointed a new Deputy Minister for 
<br>Technical Affairs, Dr. Hamad Al-Awfy, who will handle all 
<br>anti-dumping issues, he said.  Al-Awfy previously complained 
<br>to EconCouns that the SAG was increasingly frustrated by the 
<br>growing number of Saudi companies complaining about Chinese 
<br>dumping in Saudi Arabia.  Other senior SAG officials have 
<br>caustically complained about the low quality of Chinese 
<br>construction and the "short-term, extractive" approach of 
<br>Chinese companies to investments in Saudi Arabia.

<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>A MATURING ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP? 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) China recently surpassed the U.S. as the largest 
<br>importer of Saudi oil.  Saudi Arabia's investments in China 
<br>have increased significantly over the last few years, 
<br>including a $3.5 billion refinery in Fujian and a $2.86 
<br>billion joint-venture petrochemical complex in Tianjin. 
<br>Additionaly, President Hu Jintao commemorated the opening of 
<br>a cement plant when he visited Saudi Arabia in February 2009. 
<br> Saudi Arabia,s more forward-leaning approach, including 
<br>large-scale investments in China, indicates a maturing of the 
<br>bilateral relations and assumes a more pro-active, rather 
<br>than reactive, role towards economic engagement. (Note: 
<br>China is now the SAG's number two trade partner after the 
<br>U.S.  Saudi-Chinese bilateral trade was estimated at $40 
<br>billion in 2008, while Saudi-U.S. trade was estimated at $67 
<br>billion during the same time period.  End note.) 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>FM SAUD PRODS, FM YANG RESPONDS 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (U) While trade issues dominated FM Yang's agenda, both he 
<br>and FM Prince Saud-Al Faisal commented on the regional 
<br>political landscape in a press conference that followed their 
<br>bilateral meeting.  FM Saud spoke out against Israeli 
<br>defiance of UN Security Council resolutions and called on 
<br>China, as a permanent member of the Security Council, to 
<br>"deal with world disputes in accordance to international 
<br>legitimacy...as stipulated in the Arab Peace Initiative." 
<br>The meetings with FM Yang were "part of a framework of 
<br>coordination and consultation," FM Saud continued, that 
<br>included not only the Palestinian cause but also Iran's 
<br>nuclear file, Iraq and Yemen.  In particular, he emphasized 
<br>China's role as a member of the P5 plus 1 group and their 
<br>responsibility "to solve the (Iranian nuclear) crisis through 
<br>dialogue and peaceful means.  "Our two nations are keen that 
<br>the Middle East and the Gulf should be free of all weapons of 
<br>mass destruction, including nuclear weapons," he stressed. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (U) In response to FM Saud's comments, FM Yang said China 
<br>called for serious negotiations between Israel and Palestine 
<br>that would carry out the peace process and establish the 
<br>State of Palestine.  "China is ready for cooperation with the 
<br>world community to work for stability in the Middle East," he 
<br>added.  In regard to Iraq, he said that China extended 
<br>assistance by reducing Iraqi debt obligations to China and 
<br>forging trade agreements between Iraqi and Chinese companies. 
<br> With respect to Iran, FM Yang said the Iranian file should 
<br>be solved through "political diplomatic channels which help 
<br>stabilize the situation in the region." 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>FM SAUD: CHINA NEEDS TO MORE ACTIVELY COUNTER 
<br>IRANIAN NUKES 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Prince Torki told visiting 
<br>NEA A/S Feltman on January 26 (ref C) that FM Saud had 
<br>pressed the Chinese Foreign Minister hard on the need to be 
<br>more active in working with the rest of the international 
<br>community and the UN Security Council to counter the threat 
<br>of Iran developing a nuclear weapon.  FM Saud told FM Yang 
<br>that Saudi Arabia was convinced Iran intended to develop a 
<br>nuclear weapon, despite its assurances, and that only 
<br>concerted international action could stop that.   While no 
<br>explicit bargain was discussed, Dep FM Torki explained that 
<br>Saudi Arabia understood China was concerned about having 
<br>access to energy supplies, which could be cut off by Iran, 
<br>and wanted to attract more trade and investment.  Saudi 
<br>Arabia was willing to provide assurances on those scores to 
<br>China, but only in exchange for tangible  Chinese actions to 
<br>restrain Iran,s drive for nuclear weapons. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT: 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Since King Abdullah's historic visit to Beijing in 
<br>January 2006, the Saudi-Chinese relationship has focused 
<br>predominantly on energy and trade.  However, the relationship 
<br>may be showing signs of political evolution.  While the 
<br>Chinese would likely prefer to stay away from political 
<br>controversy, their economic power and permanent seat on the 
<br>UN Security Council has made it more and more difficult for 
<br>them to avoid politics altogether. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED:  The incentives for the Saudis to 
<br> 
<br>RIYADH 00000123  003.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>try and leverage their economic relationship with China for 
<br>political gain with respect to sensitive regional issues, 
<br>such as Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are 
<br>significant and growing.  After patiently focusing on 
<br>building the economic relationsip since 2006, FM Saud,s 
<br>public and private prodding of FM Yang indicates the Saudis 
<br>are ready to try and cash in some political chips.  End 
<br>comment.
