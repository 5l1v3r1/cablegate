<br>
<br>¶1. SUMMARY: The 9th meeting of the International Contact Group on 
<br>Guinea (ICG-G) held December 13 in Ouagadougou was marked by a 
<br>unified international community and capable leadership from the 
<br>Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union 
<br>(AU), and the UN Representative for West Africa. In the face of an 
<br>intransigent CNDD delegation (that was taken over by pro-Dadis 
<br>hardliners at the last minute), the ICG-G issued a strong statement 
<br>calling for continued sanctions against the National Committee for 
<br>Democracy and Development (CNDD), an international observer presence 
<br>during the transition, and the CNDD's agreement not to participate in 
<br>elections. While a compromise position between the CNDD and the 
<br>Forces Vives did not appear any closer, the international consensus 
<br>in clearly against the return of Dadis and in favor of international 
<br>involvement in the transition period. The declaration pushed 
<br>mediator Compaore towards a tougher line than he has been willing to 
<br>pursue up to now. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>------------------ 
<br>The 9th ICG-Guinea 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The 9th Meeting of the ICG-G took place on December 13th in 
<br>Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The U.S. was represented by DAS William 
<br>Fitzgerald and accompanied by the Charge d'Affaires. The meeting was 
<br>chaired by co-presidents the President of the ECOWAS Commission, 
<br>Mohamed Ibn Chambas, and the AU Special Envoy Ibrahima Fall. The 
<br>leadership dais was also shared by the Nigerian Junior Minister of 
<br>Foreign Affairs Bagudu Hirse and UN SRSG for West Africa Said 
<br>Djinnit. Delegations included representatives of Burkina Faso, 
<br>Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Liberia, Libya, Russia, the UK, the 
<br>European Union Presidency and European Commission, the International 
<br>Labor Organization, the Francophonie, the Organization of the Islamic 
<br>Conference, and the World Bank. Many groups were represented by 
<br>their representatives in Conakry. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>French and U.S. Share Positions 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A pre-meeting breakfast with the French delegation 
<br>demonstrated the closeness of the French and U.S. positions regarding 
<br>the current situation. The French were represented at the ICG by 
<br>Francois Goldblatt, Ambassador to Burkina Faso, Jean Grabling, 
<br>Ambassador to Guinea, Stephane Gompertz, MFA Director for Africa and 
<br>the Indian Ocean, and Charlotte Montel, Africa Advisor at MFA, who 
<br>saw President Compaore's mediation efforts as weak, and hoped that 
<br>the events of December 3 would cause Compaore to push the parties 
<br>toward a solution that would bring a quick election and minimize the 
<br>role of the CNDD in the country's future. The French share the 
<br>assessment that Morocco should keep Dadis in country, that any deal 
<br>with Dadis is impossible, and that Konate is the better if not sole 
<br>option for the transition. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The French shared the assessment that President Compaore can 
<br>and should play a more productive role as mediator, and that recent 
<br>events may lead Compaore to believe that it is in his own political 
<br>and, perhaps, economic interest to create a solution that does not 
<br>include Dadis. The French claimed not to have any further 
<br>information on the location of Dadis' would-be assassin Toumba. The 
<br>delegation also believed that a clear and firm message delivered to 
<br>Compaore would be more likely to produce results. The French and 
<br>U.S. shared some concern that ECOWAS' Chambas has not been a forceful 
<br>spokesperson for the ICG-G in past meetings and agreed to urge 
<br>stronger African voices (notably Djinnit) to speak up (Comment: As 
<br>the meeting progressed this concern was alleviated as all four 
<br>African voices were strong starting with Chambas who visibly upset 
<br>the CNDD by publicly calling for an ECOWAS observation and security 
<br>mission. End Comment). 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>Co-Chairs stake out a tough opening position 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) In the group's first meeting since the violence of September 
<br>28 and the attempted assassination of Moussa Dadis Camara, 
<br>co-presidents Chambas and Fall laid out a tough opening position. 
<br>While condemning the events of December 3 in Conakry and "any attempt 
<br>to destabilize the fragile situation that currently reigns," they 
<br>cited the "urgency and opportunity of the moment." They described 
<br>the situation in Guinea as having all necessary ingredients to become 
<br>"explosive," and suggested the need for an international force to 
<br>protect civilians and provide humanitarian assistance in Guinea, a 
<br>suggestion which visibly rankled the CNDD. The chairs also stated 
<br>bluntly that impunity for repeated human rights violation in Guinea 
<br>
<br>OUAGADOUGO 00001159 002.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>would not remain unpunished. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>Forces Vives see Guinea as "Stateless" 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) The Forces Vives were first to discuss their position with the 
<br>ICG-G and to take questions. The Forces Vives condemned the 
<br>prevailing situation in the country, which they categorized as a 
<br>complete lack of both liberty and personal security. They claimed to 
<br>be heartened by steps taken by Sekouba Konate as the new interim 
<br>leadership of the CNDD over the last several days, and believed 
<br>Sekouba was someone that they could work with. They were surprised 
<br>and disappointed to see the CNDD delegation was composed of hard 
<br>liners tied to Dadis and not by the more moderate figures who had 
<br>been expected (indeed, the CNDD delegation was headed by Col. Moussa 
<br>Keita -- one of the most virulent and explosive of Dadis' cadre). 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Forces Vives condemned the attack on President Dadis, but 
<br>when asked directly by the French, they stated their belief that 
<br>there would be greater opportunity for progress if he were to remain 
<br>in Morocco. They claimed that while they had compassion for the 
<br>wounded, they had far greater compassion for the Guinean people. The 
<br>Forces Vives very clearly declared their support for an international 
<br>presence (a "third force") in Guinea that would help to ensure the 
<br>peace throughout a transition period, and maintained their insistence 
<br>that the CNDD (described as "those who had murdered and raped") not 
<br>participate in any future elections. The Forces Vives expressed 
<br>their appreciation for the mediation efforts of President Compaore 
<br>and the ongoing work of the ICG, but asked that the group make a 
<br>strong condemnation of the prevailing situation rather than pointing 
<br>timidly at the problem. 
<br>
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>CNDD takes an early break and a hard line 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Perturbed by the opening statements of the ICG Presidency 
<br>and reportedly miffed that the ICG met with the Forces Vive before 
<br>them, the CNDD departed the conference center as soon as the opening 
<br>session concluded. The ICG then waited for hours for the CNDD 
<br>"rewrite" their response before returning to the negotiations, and 
<br>were met with a deeply entrenched position. A sneering and bellicose 
<br>Col Moussa Keita stated plainly that the presence of any 
<br>international force, whatever its makeup, on Guinean soil would be 
<br>considered an attack on Guinea's sovereignty and a declaration of 
<br>war. Keita claimed that the CNDD was itself capable of managing a 
<br>peaceful, transparent transition to democracy while protecting the 
<br>Guinean public. Their only goal, he claimed, was to construct a base 
<br>for economic growth, peace, and free elections. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) The CNDD delegation explained that the December 3 attack on 
<br>Dadis had made the context of negotiations more difficult and had 
<br>rendered the ICG's goal of election in the first half of 2010 
<br>unfeasible. They confirmed that they were willing to work through 
<br>the ICG to find a solution to the crisis, but insisted that any 
<br>effort to restrict any group from participation in any eventual 
<br>elections remained completely unacceptable, and would be detrimental 
<br>to the ideal of a fully-inclusive Guinean democracy. With the 
<br>speaking role shifting between delegation members, the group decried 
<br>sanctions on Guinea as both in violation of international law and 
<br>counterproductive in encouraging peace and stability. The group 
<br>strongly reiterated their complete confidence in President Compaore 
<br>in his role as mediator. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) Chambas told the CNDD representation to understand the new 
<br>democratic mood in Africa. Chambas said that military rule in the 
<br>region had led to too many catastrophes, and that militaries must 
<br>stay out of politics. He stated that no one can be happy with the 
<br>current situation of democracy and governance in Guinea, and that 
<br>despite CNDD's claim that it would be a "referee" in the new Guinea, 
<br>it has failed to ensure the safety of the population and its ability 
<br>to restore democracy is questionable. Chambas stated that the 
<br>"stories" coming out of the country relating to human rights abuses 
<br>made an international force necessary. It was, continued Chambas, in 
<br>no way an invasion, simply an offer of assistance to the people of 
<br>Guinea. 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>An Awkward Intervention African Mediators to Step Up 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) he Representative of the Libyn controlled Community of 
<br>Sahel-Saharan States (EN-SAD) intervened to take issue with what he 
<br>peceived to be the imposition of unacceptabl restrictions on the 
<br>sovereign state of Guinea by the ICG. After a long tirade - 
<br>
<br>OUAGADOUGO 00001159 003.3 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>questioning the ICG's existence, claiming that the CNDD saved Guinee 
<br>after Conteh, tossing accusations of inappropriate interference in 
<br>Guinea's affairs at the co-presidents, the representative of Nigeria, 
<br>and the non-African states participating in the ICG - the 
<br>representatives of the CNDD delivered a hearty round of applause 
<br>while other members of the ICG seemed surprised at the outburst. 
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>Group maintains unity 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Throughout the negotiations, the international community was 
<br>by and large on the same footing. The absence of Dadis was viewed as 
<br>an opportunity by the vast majority of the membership of the ICG. 
<br>There was very little divergence between the positions of the 
<br>international organization, the African states, the Europeans, and 
<br>the U.S. The gaps were especially minimal between the U.S., France, 
<br>and the UK. Because of this unity, the ICG was able to offer a 
<br>strong statement -- one that most consciously saw as a call for 
<br>Burkinabe President Compaore to take a more dynamic and aggressive 
<br>stance than has been seen to date. Most of the negotiation over the 
<br>text was over semantics, not substance. The text includes a renewed 
<br>call for elections as soon as possible in 2010, the CNDD agreement 
<br>not to participate in those elections, and international presence in 
<br>Guinea to ensure the peace. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Comment: The meeting allowed the international community to 
<br>take stock of the situation following the December 3 attempt on 
<br>Dadis' life. The ability of the Dadis hard liners to seize control 
<br>of the CNDD delegation worked against them -- only convincing the 
<br>African leadership through their belligerent manner that there can be 
<br>no solution involving Dadis. The situation demonstrated a remarkable 
<br>degree of international solidarity -- unfortunately coupled by a 
<br>general disappointment with President Compaore's mediation that is 
<br>seen both as timid and too prone to meet CNDD demands. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (U) This cable has been cleared by DAS Fitzgerald. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) Conakry Minimize Considered.
