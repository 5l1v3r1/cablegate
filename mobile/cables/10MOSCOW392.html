<br>SUBJECT: IRAN DOMINATES NETANYAHU'S VISIT TO MOSCOW 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Acting Political Minister Counselor Eric Green for reaso 
<br>ns 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Summary:  In a two-day visit to Moscow, PM Netanyahu 
<br>pressed his case on Iran while the GOR was more focused on 
<br>trade than the MEPP.  The Israeli PM downplayed disagreements 
<br>over Hamas and welcomed government initiatives to help 
<br>crisis-depleted economic relations.  Netanyahu came away 
<br>pleasantly surprised with Moscow's tougher attitude towards 
<br>Tehran and the GOR's willingness to countenance sanctions, 
<br>even though disagreement remains on their content.  Israeli 
<br>contacts are confident Russia will not deliver the S-300s to 
<br>Iran anytime soon.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>A Special Relationship 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) In his first official visit to Russia, PM Netanyahu 
<br>met with President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin as well 
<br>as leaders from Russia's Jewish community.  Both sides 
<br>described this as a productive visit with "frank but positive 
<br>discussions." 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) Israeli DCM Roi Rosenblit said Netanyahu's visit 
<br>emphasized the "special relationship" between Israel and 
<br>Russia.  He indicated that this the connection between the 
<br>two countries has flourished in the past year.  Thanks to 
<br>visa free travel, 400,000 Russian tourists travelled to 
<br>Israel in 2009. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>Bilateral Economic and Cultural Ties Increasing 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) According to Dmitri Lebedov, Second Secretary in the 
<br>MFA's Israel and Palestine Department, there was some 
<br>discussion of economic issues, including cooperation in 
<br>nanotechnology, agriculture, tourism and banking.  The 
<br>Russian-Israeli Bilateral Economic and Trade Commission last 
<br>met in November 2009.  The commission is planning another 
<br>meeting in 2010 in Jersusalem although a date has not yet 
<br>been selected.  Lebedev noted that Putin has agreed to visit 
<br>Israel in 2010. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Rosenblit said both sides blamed the economic crisis 
<br>for the decrease in bilateral trade in 2009 which affected 
<br>Israeli imports of both raw diamonds and petrochemicals. 
<br>Both sides are looking for ways to diversify trade to include 
<br>more agricultural products.  Rosenblit noted that Russia was 
<br>very interested in attracting Israeli investment, citing a 
<br>bilateral agreement on industrial research and development 
<br>which gives both governments the ability to finance joint 
<br>start-ups. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) Elaborating on economics issues, Rosenblit said that 
<br>Netanyahu and Putin discussed energy issues.  Rosenblit said 
<br>that Israel had discussed with Russia and Turkey the 
<br>possibility of extending to Israel a gas pipeline but this 
<br>proposal became unnecessary after Israel found offshore gas 
<br>reserves in Haifa.  Although Gazprom is still interested in 
<br>building facilities in Haifa and aiding in distribution, 
<br>Rosenblit said this was now a question for the private 
<br>sector.   Rosenblit also claimed that an agreement was 
<br>reached to launch a bilateral agricultural business forum in 
<br>Moscow, possibly in March 2010.  This would also be a private 
<br>effort, but under governmental auspices.  He also said that 
<br>there was some discussion about future outer space 
<br>cooperation for peaceful purposes. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) Rosenblit claimed that the 65th anniversary of World 
<br>War II and Holocaust remembrance were high on the agenda.  He 
<br>said that both the GOI and the GOR are unhappy with recent 
<br>attempts to revise the history of these events.  He noted 
<br>that a Holocaust Museum will be built in Russia and a 
<br>commemorative site recognizing the Red Army's role in WWII 
<br>will be constructed in Israel.  Rosenblit also said that PM 
<br>Putin invited President Peres to the May 9 Victory Day 
<br>ceremonies in Moscow later this year.  Medevedev also 
<br>reportedly green lighted the idea of a cultural program 
<br>including a "Year of Russia in Israel" and "Year of Israel in 
<br>Russia" exchange. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>Middle East Peace Not High on Either Agenda 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) According to Rosenblit, MEPP was not thoroughly 
<br>discussed and he "doubted that the Moscow Conference 
<br>specifically was mentioned."  Rosenblit also downplayed the 
<br> 
<br>MOSCOW 00000392  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>recent visits of Abbas and Meshaal and the importance 
<br>attached to them by the Russians.  He said that he believed 
<br>Georgia was of greater importance to Russia than Syria, 
<br>Lebanon or Palestine. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Rosenblit said that Netanyahu emphasized his openness 
<br>to talks between the GOR and the Palestinians because he 
<br>welcomed any way to bring them back to negotiations.  "We 
<br>wanted everyone to tell Abbas to return to negotiations 
<br>because we can't give him a deal until he sits down."  He 
<br>noted that Israel prefers direct contacts but supports any 
<br>kind of negotiations.  Rosenblit said that Israel still 
<br>insists on talks without preconditions and no interim 
<br>agreements: "Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed." 
<br>Rosenblit said that Israel supported Russia's efforts to 
<br>achieve comprehensive negotiations including Syria and 
<br>Lebanon. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Referring to the recent visit to Moscow of Khaled 
<br>Meshaal, Netanyahu told his interlocutors that Hamas should 
<br>not be legitimized by other countries.  Although Meshaal had 
<br>only a 15 minute meeting with Lavrov, it received significant 
<br>coverage in the media.  Rosenblit said Medvedev asked what 
<br>Russia could do to help with Hamas.  Netanyahu repeated that 
<br>Israel does not see Hamas as a legitimate partner but would 
<br>use the Russia-Hamas channel to discuss humanitarian issues 
<br>such as the proposed prisoner swap for IDF soldier Gilad 
<br>Shalit. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>Closer than Ever on Iran 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Lebedov sought to downplay discussions of Iran saying 
<br>that, while it was discussed, other bilateral issues took up 
<br>most of the discussions. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Rosenblit, however, claimed that Iran was clearly at 
<br>the top of Israel's agenda for this visit.  He said Netanyahu 
<br>was "keen to form a group of like-minded parties" who 
<br>recognized the danger of Iran's program and would cooperate 
<br>to stop its "militant nuclearlization."  Netanyahu emphasized 
<br>that Israel believes that once Iran has nuclear capabilities, 
<br>other regional powers will immediately seek their own nuclear 
<br>weapons.  Because of this danger, and the threat from Tehran 
<br>itself, Netanyahu urged Russia to cooperate on tougher 
<br>sanctions against Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) The Israeli side, according to Rosenblit, was 
<br>pleasantly surprised at Russia's harsh tone on Iran which had 
<br>changed dramatically even since FM Lieberman's visit in 
<br>November.  "We heard words from them that we've never heard 
<br>before," Rosenblit claimed, "and we aren't hearing the same 
<br>old arguments."  Rosenblit credited this change to the 
<br>Iranians themselves, saying that their rejection of the TRR 
<br>proposal and their decision to enrich to 20 percent had 
<br>toughened Russia's stance on Iran.  He remarked that just a 
<br>few months ago, there was concern in Israel that Iran would 
<br>divide the international community, but Iran's actions have 
<br>only served as a unifying factor. "Russia's understanding of 
<br>the Iranian nuclear issue is closer to ours than it was a few 
<br>months ago." 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>Ready to Discuss Sanctions 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (C) On the issue of sanctions, Netanyahu reportedly 
<br>handed the GOR a list of areas where Israel felt sanctions 
<br>could affect change in Iran's behavior.  The list included 
<br>restrictions on Iranian exports of energy products; Iranian 
<br>imports of refined petroleum products; the financial and 
<br>banking sectors; and, shipping and aerospace companies.  He 
<br>noted that, while Russia was ready to discuss sanctions, the 
<br>two did not necessarily see eye to eye on the specifics. 
<br>Both sides did agree, however, that the UNSC had to agree on 
<br>sanctions.  Rosenblit said that Russian officials do not 
<br>believe that unilateral sanctions will have the desired 
<br>effect.  They believe that the international community has to 
<br>maintain united and either agree to impose or not impose 
<br>sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C) Netanyahu encouraged Russia to be an example for 
<br>China regarding sanctions.  Rosenblit said both Israel and 
<br>Russia had been working bilaterally with China to convince 
<br>them that it was time for a serious discussion on sanctions. 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>S-300s: No Quid Pro Quo, but We Trust Medevedev 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>MOSCOW 00000392  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶16.  (C) When asked about media reports citing Netanyahu 
<br>himself which suggested that Israel had agreed not to restart 
<br>arms deals with Georgia in exchange for Russia's continued 
<br>inaction on the S-300s contract with Iran, Lebedov noted 
<br>that, in spite of this statement, there had been no change in 
<br>the GOR's policy.  He claimed that fulfillment of the S-300s 
<br>contract remained a political decision.  He remarked that the 
<br>S-300 system was itself defensive in nature and could not be 
<br>used against another party, such as Israel. 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  (C) Rosenblit also would not acknowledge that a deal had 
<br>been made.  Instead, he said that Netanyahu had reiterated 
<br>his trust in Medvedev regarding the S-300s.  According to 
<br>Rosenblit, Netanyahu believes that Russia has taken "all 
<br>aspects of regional stability" into account when taking 
<br>decisions on the S-300s.  Rosenblit did note that the S-300s 
<br>issue offered a window onto the different vectors in Russian 
<br>foreign policy, with the contradictory statements that their 
<br>delivery was imminent, and the delay being caused by 
<br>technical and political issues, coming just days before 
<br>Netanyahu's visit. 
<br> 
<br>¶18.  (C) Rosenblit said that neither Russia nor Israel was 
<br>linking the S-300 issue with arms sales to Georgia.  Israel, 
<br>he claimed, as a Russian partner, was "listening attentively" 
<br>to Russia's concerns about weapons supplies to Georgia and 
<br>the effects this could have in the region.  Israel has 
<br>friendly relations with Georgia but the Russian relationship 
<br>was also very important, he said.  He indicated that both 
<br>sides were trying to come to an "understanding." 
<br> 
<br>¶19.  (C) Comment: The Russian media built up the Prime 
<br>Minster's visit as the final stage of Russia's 
<br>Abbas-Meshaal-Netanyahu trifecta of Middle East callers. 
<br>While both sides paid lip-service to MEPP issues, Iran was 
<br>the main agenda item.  This reflects Netanyahu's priorities 
<br>and the GOR's belief that it is Washington's job, not 
<br>Moscow's, to pressure the Israelis on MEPP issues.  Israel 
<br>came away pleased with Russia's changed posture on Iran, but 
<br>disappointed that its list of sanctions was too ambitious for 
<br>the GOR.  Separately, the widely reported "quid-pro-quo" on a 
<br>mutual freeze of the Russian S-300 delivery for Iran and 
<br>Israeli military sales to Georgia could be a convenient 
<br>Israeli invention.  While Israeli contacts say there is no 
<br>formal deal, Netanyahu's statements to the media created 
<br>enough speculation to put Russia in a corner.  Should Moscow 
<br>eventually deliver the system to Iran, Israel has a pretext 
<br>to step up arms sales to Georgia.
