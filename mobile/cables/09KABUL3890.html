<br>
<br>Classified By: Coordinator Director for Development and Economic Affair
<br>s E. Anthony Wayne, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: As we step up engagement with GIRoA
<br>leadership in Kandahar, it is important to understand the
<br>dynamics of political power and how fundamental Kandahar is
<br>to the fortunes of the Karzai regime. It is from Kandahar
<br>that President Karzai's claim to national legitimacy
<br>originates and from the province that the Karzai family's
<br>position as a semi-modern aristocracy stems. As the kingpin
<br>of Kandahar, the President's younger half-brother Ahmed Wali
<br>Karzai (AWK) dominates access to economic resources,
<br>patronage, and protection. Much of the real business of
<br>running Kandahar takes place out of public sight, where AWK
<br>operates, parallel to formal government structures, through a
<br>network of political clans that use state institutions to
<br>protect and enable licit and illicit enterprises. A dramatic
<br>example is the Arghandab river valley, an agriculturally rich
<br>and heavily-populated district strategically located at the
<br>northern gate to Kandahar City, where the President's direct
<br>intervention in the Alikozai tribal succession increased
<br>Karzai political dominance over two of the most valuable
<br>resources in Kandahar -- fertile land and water. The tribal
<br>power structure in Kandahar seriously complicates our efforts
<br>to bring formal justice and modern governance to the region.
<br>In the absence of GIRoA initiatives to bring key individuals
<br>closely linked to the Karzai regime to justice, RC South is
<br>pursuing a bottom-up approach to the Arghandab shura. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) As we step up engagement with GIRoA leadership in
<br>Kandahar in pursuit of U.S. security, stabilization,
<br>development and anti-corruption goals, it is important to
<br>understand the dynamics of political power and how
<br>fundamental Kandahar is to the fortunes of the Karzai regime
<br>(Ref A). It is from Kandahar, not Kabul, that President
<br>Karzai's claim to national legitimacy originates, and where,
<br>through leadership of the royal Durrani Popalzai tribe, he
<br>has a true political base. In Kandahar, political clans
<br>consisting of personal, tribal, marriage and economic
<br>alliances engage in balance of power competition and
<br>cooperation. At the pinnacle of Kandahar's political clans,
<br>the Karzai clan functions as a semi-modern aristocracy, with
<br>the President ultimately presiding over the nation.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) As the kingpin of Kandahar, the President's younger
<br>half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, rules over political deal
<br>and decision-making at the provincial level and thereby
<br>dominates access to economic resources, patronage and
<br>protection. The overriding purpose that unifies his
<br>political roles as Chairman of the Kandahar Provincial
<br>Council and as the President's personal representative to the
<br>South is the enrichment, extension and perpetuation of the
<br>Karzai clan, and along with it their branch of the Popalzai
<br>tribe. This applies equally to his entrepreneurial and his
<br>alleged criminal activities. AWK derives authority and
<br>legitimacy from his relationship to President Karzai, from
<br>the relative discipline and elite position of the Popalzai
<br>tribe and from his access to resources. In Kandahar's
<br>political realm, he is an unrivaled strongman. For example,
<br>the Kandahar Provincial Council, which is made up largely of
<br>individuals who are personally beholden to him, wields
<br>serious influence, despite its lack of statutory powers. It
<br>is currently going about its business unhindered despite the
<br>fraud charges that have prevented the IEC from certifying the
<br>recent Provincial Council election results (Ref B). xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Much of the real business of running Kandahar takes
<br>place out of public sight, where AWK operates parallel to
<br>formal government structures through a network of political
<br>clans that use state institutions to protect and enable licit
<br>and illicit enterprises. At its core, this clan network has
<br>a caste-like division of labor. The Popalzai occupy the
<br>leadership pinnacle. The Barakzai, with Gul Agha
<br>Sherzai as their leader, compete for power and business,
<br>which includes, for example, contracting at Kandahar Air
<br>Field and transport on Highway 4 from the Pakistan border at
<br>Spin Boldak. The Noorzai occupy key positions in the ANSF
<br>and are the traditional racketeers (with ties to narcotics
<br>trafficking). The Achekzais along the border are the
<br>traditional smugglers, and the Alikozai are the traditional
<br>
<br>Kabul 00003890 002 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>warriors.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Among Karzai family-run businesses are alleged
<br>control of trucking on Highway 1 (the Ring Road) through
<br>Kandahar Province and beyond, private security contracting
<br>and real estate. The last notably includes Ayno Mina, an
<br>ostentatious Karzai property development for Afghan elites
<br>east of Kandahar City, built on land obtained from the
<br>government at rock bottom prices, with financing guaranteed
<br>by OPIC. In a land of popular strongmen, AWK is widely
<br>unpopular in Kandahar, because he rules exclusively rather
<br>than inclusively; he is not perceived as caring about the
<br>population at large but rather, as a traditional Pashtuns
<br>Khan using his power to "feed his tribe."
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) A good example of how the Karzais' power plays out in
<br>Kandahar can be found in the Arghandab river valley, an
<br>agriculturally rich and heavily populated district
<br>strategically located at the northern gate to Kandahar City,
<br>where the Alikozai tribe makes up 60 percent of the
<br>population. They received the valley as a reward for
<br>assisting the founder of Afghanistan, Ahmed Shah Durrani,
<br>conquer Kandahar in the mid-1700s. As the guardians of
<br>Kandahar, the Alikozais have prevented all invaders from
<br>occupying Arghandab. The Soviets fought hard but never took
<br>it and as a result were never secure in Kandahar City. The
<br>Taliban's rise to power began in Kandahar, when the powerful
<br>Alikozai leader Mullah Naquibullah decided to give them the
<br>keys to the city, and he turned on them to assist their
<br>overthrow in 2001. When Mullah Naqib died of a heart attack
<br>in 2007, President Karzai took the unusual step of flying to
<br>Kandahar, where he anointed Naquib's son Karimullah as the
<br>new leader of the Alikozai. However, the move had
<br>significant blowback. Mullah Naqib had never designated his
<br>young and inexperienced son as his
<br>successor, and Karzai's intervention generated resentment
<br>among senior Alikozai elders. The resulting split weakened
<br>tribal unity, a vulnerability the Taliban quickly exploited,
<br>and it remains a present source of instability.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Arghandab story appears on the surface to be a
<br>case of bungled tribal exploitation. On the contrary, by
<br>intervening in the Alikozai succession, the Karzais linked
<br>the most important tribal faction to control over the
<br>provincial government in a line that runs from AWK to their
<br>putative leader Karimullah, who in turn holds sway over the
<br>District Administrator and local shura. The Karzais also
<br>increased their influence over two of the most valuable
<br>resources in Kandahar (which is largely desert) -- fertile
<br>land and water. The Arghandab river valley, contains some of
<br>the best agricultural land in Afghanistan; it famously
<br>produces 80 percent of the country's pomegranates.
<br>Production and land values there will increase greatly as a
<br>result of Canada's "signature" rehabilitation of the Dahla
<br>Dam and irrigation works, originally constructed by the U.S.
<br>in the 1950s. Karzai businesses are also set to
<br>acquire multiple patronage benefits from Dahla Dam
<br>construction and security contracts, but the main prize will
<br>be political control over long-term allocation of water
<br>flows, including to Popalzai and Barakzai areas that lie well
<br>downstream, via underground canals to the south.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) It is no accident that AWK lobbied the project's
<br>Canadian sponsors on behalf of the Watan Group, the eventual
<br>winner of the Dahla Dam security contract, whose CEO is his
<br>cousin, U.S. national Rashid Popal. More than business is
<br>involved; most of the project lies in Alikozai majority
<br>areas, but the Popalzai will control security, and Alikozai
<br>leader Karimullah was incensed over this treatment by his
<br>Karzai sponsors when he found out. A follow-on to warlord
<br>militias, private security companies today also serve
<br>personal interests as camouflaged vehicles for protection
<br>rackets in construction, transportation and drug smuggling.
<br>AWK's determined but so far unsuccessful efforts to acquire
<br>MOI-sanction to license all contractors and their weapons
<br>through the Provincial Council has the potential to arm the
<br>Karzai clan with a non-state entity that can insure against
<br>whoever should come to power in Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Comment: The traditional tribal power structures in
<br>Kandahar have many implications for U.S. objectives in the
<br>region. Initiatives that rely on GIRoA to take the lead in
<br>bringing to justice major corrupt figures or negative
<br>influences in Kandahar contain a serious dilemma: they would
<br>include some of Karzai,s closest relatives and allies and
<br>require the prosecution of people on whom we often rely for
<br>assistance and/or support. Second, any efforts to bring
<br>these individuals to justice could compromise the informal
<br>
<br>Kabul 00003890 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>governing networks to which Kandaharis have become
<br>accustomed, without necessarily replacing them with effective
<br>GIRoA officials or improving the delivery of services. A
<br>focus on bottom-up local solutions, such as identifying and
<br>reaching out to the multiple factions in Arghandab as well as
<br>the official shura, which RC South is pursuing, could offset
<br>this problem to some degree. End Comment.
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) This assessment, derived from multiple sources
<br>including information provided by over a dozen
<br>knowledgeable Afghans, presents a perspective that is widely
<br>perceived among the Afghan public and consistent with
<br>documentation in open sources and intelligence analyses.
