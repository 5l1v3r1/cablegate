<br>¶1. (S/NF) WASHINGTON ANALYSTS ASSESS THAT TEHRAN IS 
<br>REACHING OUT TO LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE 
<br>ITS DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION AND INCREASE TIES TO LEFTIST 
<br>COUNTRIES IN THE REGION THAT TEHRAN PERCEIVES MAY SHARE ITS 
<br>ANTI-US AGENDA. PRESIDENT AHMADI-NEJAD APPEARS TO BE THE 
<br>DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THIS POLICY, AND HE HAS RECEIVED 
<br>PERSONAL ASSISTANCE FROM VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT HUGO CHAVEZ. 
<br>IRAN'S TIES WITH VENEZUELA, WHICH INCLUDE MILITARY 
<br>COOPERATION, ARE THE CLOSEST AND MOST SIGNIFICANT. GIVEN THE 
<br>HIGH-PROFILE IRAN-VENEZUELA RELATIONSHIP, HIZBALLAH-LINKED 
<br>INDIVIDUALS PROBABLY SEE VENEZUELA AS A SAFEHAVEN WHERE THEY 
<br>CAN CONDUCT FUNDRAISING AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES WITHOUT 
<br>INTERFERENCE. OTHER POPULIST GOVERNMENTS LIKE BOLIVIA, 
<br>ECUADOR, AND NICARAGUA HAVE ALSO SOUGHT TO CREATE CLOSER 
<br>POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TIES WITH IRAN. IRAN HAS ESTABLISHED 
<br>CULTURAL CENTERS IN 16 COUNTRIES OF THE REGION AND HAS 
<br>EMBASSIES IN 10 COUNTRIES. AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT AND 
<br>AS APPLICABLE TO POST, ANALYSTS AND SENIOR LEVEL POLICYMAKERS
