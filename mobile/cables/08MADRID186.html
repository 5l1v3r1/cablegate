<br>Classified By: DCM Hugo Llorens for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: FM Moratinos' Chief of Staff Javier Sancho
<br>told DCM February 20 that it was politically impossible for
<br>Spain to support the Kosovar UDI at this time, and that this
<br>is the position of both the ruling PSOE government and the
<br>opposition Partido Popular (PP). Sancho said the Spanish
<br>have tried to be as constructive as possible in Brussels and
<br>have stuck to the position they have consistently elaborated
<br>with high-level USG officials in Washington and Madrid:
<br>UNSCR 1244 does not provide for a unilateral declaration of
<br>independence by Kosovo; therefore, Spain wants a new UNSCR or
<br>a negotiated settlement between the parties. Nevertheless,
<br>Sancho said, Spain did not try to oppose an EU statement on
<br>Kosovo in Brussels, instead crafting a consensus text that
<br>focuses on the EU's commitment to the Balkans while leaving
<br>the issue of recognition to the individual member states.
<br>The GOS will continue to support KFOR, EULEX, and the OSCE
<br>presence in Kosovo. Sancho said this is the final GOS
<br>position on Kosovo until after the elections. If Zapatero
<br>wins reelection, the GOS will be willing to discuss further
<br>avenues for progress toward peace and stability in the
<br>Balkans and to work constructively with the U.S. Ambassador
<br>Aguirre will have lunch with Deputy FM Bernardino Leon
<br>February 21 and will press Leon on how Spain can move forward
<br>in the Balkans after the elections. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The DCM delivered ref A demarche to Javier Sancho,
<br>Chief of Staff to Foreign Minister Moratinos. Moratinos, who
<br>is running for Parliament representing Cordoba, was
<br>unavailable from the campaign trail in Andalucia as he was
<br>under the weather.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Sancho told the DCM that it was politically
<br>impossible for the GOS to support Kosovo's unilateral
<br>declaration of independence in the middle of a hotly
<br>contested campaign, and to have expected otherwise was not
<br>realistic. Sancho noted that both the ruling PSOE government
<br>and the opposition PP opposed the UDI and had said so
<br>publicly numerous times in the months leading to February 17.
<br>Sancho said that the GOS had maintained this position
<br>consistently both in Brussels and with high-level USG
<br>officials, but had tried to be as constructive as possible in
<br>supporting an EU consensus. Sancho noted that Moratinos had
<br>led the GAERC in producing a consensus conclusion on Kosovo
<br>that did not discuss recognition, when he could have proposed
<br>a text opposing the UDI.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Sancho told the DCM that there would be no more
<br>public statements from the MFA on their Kosovo position prior
<br>to the elections, adding that the GOS wants it out of the
<br>headlines. If Zapatero wins reelection March 9, Sancho said
<br>the GOS would be open to further discussions on working with
<br>the U.S. and toward EU consensus for peace and stability in
<br>the Balkans.
<br>
<br>//MORATINOS PRESS COMMENTS//
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) Major international and Spanish media seized on
<br>Moratinos' comments in Brussels prior to entering the
<br>February 18 GAERC, in which he said, "The Spanish government
<br>will not recognize the unilateral act proclaimed yesterday by
<br>the Kosovar assembly, and it will not recognize it because we
<br>do not believe it respects international legality... The
<br>Spanish government has always defended respect for
<br>international legality. It defended it when it decided to
<br>withdraw troops from Iraq, and it defends it again now when
<br>talking about the secession of a state... If you examine the
<br>nations who are against this recognition, they are the
<br>countries that know best and are the most similar to the West
<br>Balkans."
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) Moratinos went on to say that Kosovar independence
<br>would be legal if brought about by a new UNSCR or by a
<br>negotiated agreement between the parties, and that Spain
<br>wished to uphold the international principle of territorial
<br>integrity. He also said Spain would continue to support
<br>stability and security for the Balkans. The GOS has stated
<br>that it will maintain its presence in KFOR and its support
<br>for EULEX and the OSCE mission in Kosovo.
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Asked by reporters February 19 whether Spain's
<br>elections impacted its policy on Kosovo, Moratinos denied
<br>this and said, "Yesterday we made a proposal to guarantee a
<br>minimum of unity among EU partners, and above all, to support
<br>and monitor stability and security in the region, which is
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000186 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>part of Europe and which we are interested in preserving and
<br>guaranteeing."
<br>
<br>//SPANISH ELECTORAL ENVIRONMENT//
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) As both the GOS and the PP predicted privately to
<br>post, Kosovo's independence has prompted numerous provocative
<br>statements by nationalist parties in the Basque Country and
<br>Catalonia. Catalan Left (ERC) spokesman Joan Ridao said
<br>February 18 that Kosovo was "a very important precedent" for
<br>Catalonia and the Basque Country, adding that "when the
<br>people want independence, it must be accepted... Any country
<br>or nation under the scope of the EU in the 21st century can
<br>achieve its independence if it is democratically decided...
<br>no one can avoid this." In a blog entry entitled, "Spain
<br>does not have the balls to send tanks against us," ERC
<br>Parliamentarian Joan Puig wrote that Kosovo was "another
<br>proof that our nation will be independent if a political and
<br>social majority decides it. Spain understands this very
<br>clearly, which is why it has reacted in this way." Josep
<br>Carod-Rovira, vice president of the Catalan Generalitat and
<br>renowned Catalanista, called on the GOS to recognize Kosovo
<br>as soon as possible on January 18, as did Artur Mas, the
<br>president of Catalan centrist party Convergence and Union
<br>(CiU). On February 20, representatives from CiU and ERC
<br>announced they would travel to Kosovo to "study the secession
<br>process."
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) spokeswoman Miren
<br>Azkarate said Kosovo's independence was "a lesson in how to
<br>resolve conflicts of identity and belonging in a peaceful,
<br>democratic manner... the will of the people is the key to
<br>resolving entrenched political problems... Kosovo is a new
<br>example of the vigor of the democratic right to self
<br>determination enshrined in international law, and it betrays
<br>once more those who maintain that this right does not exist
<br>in democratic nations."
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) By contrast, the PP has maintained staunch unity in
<br>its position against Kosovo's independence. PP founder and
<br>elder statesman Manuel Fraga said February 19 that Spain must
<br>not support Kosovo because one could "draw the same
<br>conclusions about Spain in (the Basque town of) Galdakano or
<br>in a Catalan town. Spain cannot accept that any group
<br>whatsoever can declare itself independent with all the
<br>complications this has implied" in the Balkans. Fraga also
<br>called on the GOS to withdraw its forces from KFOR.
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) PP President and presidential candidate Mariano
<br>Rajoy said February 18 that Spain "should not send or
<br>maintain the presence of civilian officials" in Kosovo after
<br>its UDI, which he said was "contrary to international
<br>legality." Speaking on a conservative news program, Rajoy
<br>said, "If there is no agreement between the parties and no
<br>new resolution from the UN Security Council, this is against
<br>international legality, such that I believe Spain should not
<br>recognize Kosovo as an independent state." Rajoy went on to
<br>add that the situation had nothing to do with nationalist
<br>movements in Spain. He said, "Spain is the oldest nation in
<br>Europe with more than 500 years of history... In Kosovo there
<br>is a military and religious conflict, and here there is
<br>absolutely nothing of the sort." The next day, February 19,
<br>Rajoy took it one step further, calling on President Zapatero
<br>and Moratinos to explain the "incongruity" of opposing
<br>Kosovo's independence yet maintaining support for
<br>international missions to Kosovo. He added that he would
<br>have preferred "that Spanish diplomats had better managed
<br>this fight."
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) Gustavo de Aristegui, PP foreign affairs expert and
<br>ranking member of the Spanish Foreign Affairs Commission,
<br>wrote February 18 in EL MUNDO that, "the unilateral
<br>declaration of independence is unacceptable, illegal and a
<br>defiance to the peace and stability of all of Europe."
<br>
<br>//MAINSTREAM EDITORIAL PRESS//
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) The tone across the entire political spectrum of
<br>Spanish press expressed concern for the potential
<br>ramifications in Spain and Europe. An ABC editorial
<br>declared, "Kosovo is going to be an economic and political
<br>burden for the European Union, but a sweet gift for the U.S.,
<br>which will have a new ally and a gigantic military base in
<br>the only majority-Muslim country in the world where U.S.
<br>flags are sold in kiosks." A February 18 editorial in
<br>liberal EL Publico stated, "The negotiations of the Spanish
<br>foreign ministry and of Aznar failed in Washington. The
<br>attempts to convince the U.S. of the danger that independence
<br>implies did not convince." Pilar Bonet wrote in the Catalan
<br>paper LA VANGUARDIA February 18, "Kosovo's independence opens
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000186 003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>up a Pandora's box and reopens healed wounds in the
<br>territorial configuration of the successor states to the
<br>Soviet Union." Andres Ortega wrote in EL PAIS February 18,
<br>"More than a declaration of independence it seems like a
<br>declaration of dependence. Kosovo does not appear to be a
<br>prepared or viable country." A February 20 op-ed in
<br>conservative La Razon stated, "Europe has set a very
<br>dangerous precedent, one that will affect the territorial
<br>integrity of some nations that have supported the process."
<br>EL PAIS published a February 20 op-ed stating, "Kosovo is
<br>today an 'Ulster' in its potential for nuclear combustion in
<br>the Balkans and beyond." Julia Navarro wrote in a February
<br>19 op-ed for wire service Europa Press, "In Spain we can
<br>already start soaking our beards; Kosovo's independence will
<br>have consequences on our country, more so now that all the
<br>politicians have said you cannot compare one situation with
<br>the other. We all know you can, and that it is simply a
<br>question of a few soulless rulers in the United States and
<br>the European Union deciding one day that in Spain there are
<br>other Kosovos."
<br>
<br>//WELL, SO WHAT?//
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) If the leftist and nationalist parties are happy
<br>about Kosovo's independence, if the PSOE government needs the
<br>leftist and nationalist parties to form a coalition
<br>government after the elections, and if all mainstream parties
<br>agree that Spain and Kosovo are not the same, then what is
<br>the PSOE government so worried about? The answer lies in the
<br>PSOE's need to assure the centrist, mainstream Spanish voter
<br>that all of the PP's accusations about Zapatero "Balkanizing"
<br>Spain and "presiding over the dissolution of the 500 year old
<br>Spanish kingdom" are groundless. By recognizing Kosovo prior
<br>to the elections, the GOS would have opened itself up to
<br>renewed attacks from the right about pandering to nationalist
<br>minorities, when in fact the PSOE gains nothing electoral by
<br>joining nationalist minorities on Kosovo. These minority
<br>parties will have no choice but to join with the PSOE after
<br>the election if they hope to govern. The nationalist parties
<br>are understandably pumping up the issue to increase their
<br>turnout, but they too understand the state of play.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) The PSOE's biggest fear is not criticism from the
<br>left but abstention from the center. Low turnout by
<br>distraught left-leaning centrists combined with the strong
<br>mobilization of the "king and country" PP base would put a
<br>PSOE victory at risk. In this sense, the PP has left no
<br>wiggle room whatsoever by laying out clear markers, including
<br>by former President Aznar, that the PSOE would not be able to
<br>slide by on EU consensus on Kosovo. Speculation about how
<br>Kosovo might have fared under the PP is somewhat pointless,
<br>but all indications are that a Rajoy government would have
<br>been no more amenable to a UDI had the matter been pushed
<br>until after the elections. In any case, the PP can now argue
<br>that Kosovo's independence is bad for Spain and that the
<br>Zapatero government was too weak internationally to prevent
<br>it.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) For its part, the GOS is caught in a logical trap -
<br>how to reconcile their continuing military and civilian
<br>presence in Kosovo with their refusal to recognize Kosovo's
<br>right to independence. As statements by nationalist
<br>politicians and editorials by mainstream Spaniards show, this
<br>issue is not completely foreign to Spanish politics, and the
<br>average Spaniard does not want Kosovo to imply a precedent
<br>for the Basque Country and Catalonia. Their best option, and
<br>the one which they are following, is to keep Zapatero out of
<br>it, get the issue out of the headlines, and move on.
<br>Moratinos, Defense Minister Alonso, and former Defense
<br>Minister Pepe Bono have done the heavy lifting. Moratinos
<br>even earned rare praise from French FM Kouchner who said "the
<br>Spaniards were intelligent and generous" in their maneuvering
<br>at the GAERC.
<br>
<br>//NEXT MOVES//
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) The PSOE caught a break with the February 19
<br>announcement of Fidel Castro's resignation, which takes
<br>Kosovo off the front page in Spain and also allows Zapatero
<br>and the GOS to engage the rhetorical machine on how Spain
<br>must help Cuba toward democracy. Additionally, their policy
<br>of engagement, while obviously not a driving force in
<br>Castro's resignation, enhances GOS credibility with the
<br>pro-Cuban Spanish populace, as well as with the pro-Castro
<br>far-left.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Ambassador Aguirre will have lunch with Deputy FM
<br>Bernardino Leon February 21 and will press Leon on how Spain
<br>can move forward in the Balkans after the elections.
