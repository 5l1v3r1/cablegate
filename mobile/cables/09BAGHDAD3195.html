<br>SUBJECT: IRAN/IRAQ: THE VIEW FROM NAJAF 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political M/C Gary A. Grappo for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Local interlocutors from Najaf's social, 
<br>economic, political and military circles discussed with 
<br>Post's Senior Iran Watcher (IW) and PRToffs the scope of 
<br>Iranian influence in the province, the role of the Shia 
<br>clerical establishment (Marja'iyyah), notably Grand Ayatollah 
<br>Ali Sistani, and the challenges confronting the province's 
<br>farmers who are unable to compete with Iranian-subsidized 
<br>produce. Interlocutors generally cautioned against a 
<br>premature U.S. departure and agreed that Iran remains an 
<br>influential force in Najaf, leveraging its ties with Iraqi 
<br>political groups to extend its influence. Iran remains wary 
<br>of Sistani's social and political clout among Shias, notably 
<br>in Iran, given the Grand Ayatollah's rejection of the Iranian 
<br>regime's adherence to clerical rule (vilayat-e-faqih). END 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) During a recent visit to Najaf, local interlocutors, 
<br>including the province's head of military intelligence; the 
<br>chairman of the Provincial Council; a well-connected Shia 
<br>businessman; the president of the farmer's union; the chief 
<br>judge of the province; and a representative of the local 
<br>Chamber of Commerce shared their views on the state of 
<br>political and economic development in the province and Iran's 
<br>role. 
<br>
<br>Provincial Council Chairman 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Sheikh Fayedh al-Shimerri, the Chairman of Najaf's 
<br>Provincial Council, a religious cleric turned politician and 
<br>member of Maliki's State of Law coalition asserted that 
<br>Iraqis throughout the country were growing increasingly 
<br>frustrated with foreign interference, notably from Iraq's 
<br>neighbors. He singled out Saudi Arabia and Iran as the 
<br>biggest culprits, but noted that a "mental revolution" was 
<br>underway among Iraqi youth against foreign agendas seeking to 
<br>undermine the country's stability, pointing to such trends in 
<br>Anbar against the Saudis, Najaf against the Iranians, and 
<br>Mosul against the Turks. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Al-Shimerri echoed other interlocutors' concerns 
<br>about a premature U.S. departure from Iraq and risks of a 
<br>political and security vacuum. He noted that Iran had formed 
<br>the Iraqi National Alliance (INA) political coalition 
<br>comprised of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) and 
<br>the Sadrists, among others, in an effort to bolster ISCI's 
<br>image as the pan-Shia party of choice in the elections. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Al-Shimerri expressed concerns about rumors 
<br>circulating in Najaf that the USG was sponsoring a Baathist 
<br>conference in the U.S. IW dismissed the news as baseless 
<br>rumors intended to undermine the USG-GOI relationship. 
<br>(NOTE: A recent press report in an ISCI-owned media also 
<br>mentioned a proposed Baathist conference scheduled to be held 
<br>in Washington in February. END NOTE). 
<br>
<br>Keeping the U.S. Bogged Down 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Major Uday, a provincial military intelligence 
<br>officer and Maliki supporter, described Iran as a threat to 
<br>Iraqi stability, commenting that the Iranian government's 
<br>(IRIG) goal is to keep the U.S. bogged down in Iraq in order 
<br>to discourage U.S. military reprisals against the IRIG for 
<br>its nuclear program. He commented that Iran fears Iraq's 
<br>potential influence in the region, and will continue to 
<br>support local proxies to exert its influence and undermine 
<br>Iraq. "Iran does not offer its support for free," Uday 
<br>noted, there will be a price to pay for each proxy in 
<br>exchange for Iranian support. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Uday is supportive of Maliki's decision to forego (at 
<br>Q7. (C) Uday is supportive of Maliki's decision to forego (at 
<br>least for now) a political alliance with the INA that is 
<br>dominated by the pro-Iranian Sadrist Trend and ISCI. Joining 
<br>the INA will only undermine the integrity of Iraqi security 
<br>institutions as ISCI/Badr and the Sadrists will try to fill 
<br>key security positions with their own supporters, many of 
<br>whom are unprofessional and sectarian, Uday cautioned. The 
<br>Badr Organization, heavily influenced by Iran, continued to 
<br>maintain a very effective intelligence arm, according to 
<br>Uday. Many former Iraqi fighter pilots who flew sorties 
<br>against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war were now on Iran's hit 
<br>list (NOTE: According to Uday, Iran had already assassinated 
<br>180 Iraqi pilots. END NOTE). 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Uday also noted that Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) elements 
<br>often resort to bribes (USD 10-20K) to secure the release of 
<br>supporters in GOI detention and that the Najaf anti-terrorism 
<br>unit regularly receives cash offers to release detainees. He 
<br>asserted that Najaf's police chief, Abd Al-Karim (aka Abu 
<br>Ahmad Al-Miyahi), is a "former" member of Badr with dubious 
<br>loyalties. Najaf's chief justice, Kareem Faroon, a 
<br>well-respected judge also alleged that the Iraqi police were 
<br>responsible for placing an IED close to the PRT base in 
<br>November. "He (police chief) is a bad guy. After all, he is 
<br>still part of the militia (Badr)," Judge Faroon asserted. 
<br>
<br>Sistani: "What Do the Americans Want?" 
<br>----QDI>RpQd%'MkQQto pulse the cleric on 
<br>his views about matters of political consequence. Kelanter 
<br>explained that Sistani's son, Muhammad Ridha, serves as the 
<br>main conduit of information between his father whenever a 
<br>religious/political message needs to be conveyed to Shia 
<br>imams in the country. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Sistani does not allow Iranian students to enroll 
<br>in the howzeh (religious seminary) in order to prevent IRIG 
<br>infiltration, Kelanter asserted. Kelanter himself is 
<br>suspicious of Iranian intentions and asserted that the imams 
<br>of the holy Abbas and Husayn shrines in Karbala, Shaykhs 
<br>Karbal'aie and Safi, were "in the pocket of the Iranians", 
<br>despite their proclaimed loyalties to Sistani. 
<br>
<br>The Sadrists 
<br>------------ 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Regarding the Sadrists, Kelanter recalled fondly his 
<br>time as a student of the late Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr (Moqtada 
<br>Al-Sadr's father), commenting that, unlike his radical son, 
<br>the late cleric was admired and respected by many Iraqis. He 
<br>Qthe late cleric was admired and respected by many Iraqis. He 
<br>criticized Moqtada for failing to capitalize and build on his 
<br>father's legacy. Al-Shimmeri also praised the efforts of 
<br>Sadr's father and sought to distinguish between "good" and 
<br>"bad" Sadrists; the former being adherents of Sadr's father. 
<br>Major Uday believes the Sadrists are politically weak and 
<br>continue to splinter as former JAM elements form their own 
<br>groups. (NOTE: Major Uday believes Al-Shimmari is a closet 
<br>Sadrist despite his public alliance with Maliki's coalition. 
<br>Al-Shimmari commented that the Iranians had told the wayward 
<br>Moqtada to stay-put in Iran for the time being. END NOTE). 
<br>
<br>
<br>Farmers: Iran and Syria Waging Economic Warfare 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Jabar Al-Garawi, the head of Najaf's Farmers' Union 
<br>commented that most farmers support PM Maliki for his 
<br>increasingly non-sectarian political message and success in 
<br>improving security. However, he complained that Iran and 
<br>Syria were waging economic warfare on Iraqi farmers by 
<br>flooding provincial markets with low cost/quality produce 
<br>that are heavily subsidized by their respective governments. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Iraq's neighbors were pursuing such measures in 
<br>order to prevent economic development, thereby forestalling 
<br>the continued success of Iraq's new democracy, Al-Garawi 
<br>alleged. These problems were further aggravated by water 
<br>shortages due to the ongoing drought, the high cost of fuels, 
<br>outdated farming techniques, and power shortages, he noted. 
<br>Al-Garawi confirmed that the Najaf Provincial Council had 
<br>recently voted to ban the import of foreign tomatoes into 
<br>Najaf in an effort to bolster local producers. (NOTE: 60 
<br>percent of Najaf's labor force works in agriculture. The 
<br>sector is the province's most important revenue generating 
<br>industry, followed by religious tourism. END NOTE). 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Samira Al-Halawi, an outspoken female member of the 
<br>Najaf Chamber of Commerce, having recently returned from a 
<br>USG-sponsored visitors program in the U.S., railed against 
<br>Iran's pervasive commercial influence in Najaf, noting that 
<br>many Iranian-owned companies secure favorable contracts in 
<br>the province by capitalizing on ties with local politicians. 
<br>She also criticized Iraqi politicians "for being ignorant 
<br>and overly-reliant on clerics" for their political welfare. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Najaf, as the epicenter of Shia Islam, carries 
<br>significant importance for Iran and its overall campaign to 
<br>expand its sphere of influence in Iraq and the region. The 
<br>city is home to many Iranian pilgrims and traders eager to 
<br>profit spiritually and financially from the city's religious 
<br>and commercial offerings. There is general awareness and 
<br>acknowledgment among many Iraqis that Iran's influence, 
<br>albeit a historic reality, does not always translate into 
<br>mutual benefit for Najafis. Many also acknowledge that Iran 
<br>will continue to capitalize on its ties to the city in order 
<br>to foster greater socio-economic dependencies. The extent of 
<br>its ability to influence the ways of the Marja'iyyah are more 
<br>limited, particularly during Sistani's tenure, given the 
<br>clerical establishment's unrivaled theocratic and geographic 
<br>prominence when compared to its "sister city" Qom.
