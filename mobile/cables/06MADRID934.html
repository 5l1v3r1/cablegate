<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN'S OPPOSITION POPULAR PARTY: LOSING THE
<br>BATTLE WITH THE GOVERNMENT
<br>
<br>REF: A. MADRID 765
<br>¶B. MADRID 783
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Summary. Two years after it lost in the dramatic
<br>elections of March 14, 2004 -- three days after the March 11
<br>terrorist attacks -- Spain's main opposition party, the
<br>Partido Popular (PP) finds itself outmaneuvered and either
<br>isolated with radical nationalists or forced to collaborate
<br>with the Socialist government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero
<br>on the most important issues of Spanish domestic politics.
<br>Even when the governing PSOE (Socialist) party was losing
<br>ground in opinion polls, the statistics did not reflect any
<br>increase in popularity for the PP, only a fall in the
<br>government approval rating because of uncertainty about
<br>regional questions in Catalonia and the Basque Country. The
<br>recent ceasefire announcement by the Basque terrorist group
<br>ETA has raised the government's poll ratings significantly,
<br>and marks a monumental inflection point for the PP in its
<br>search for the critical swing votes at the center of the
<br>political spectrum. A combination of leadership and message
<br>problems has kept the PP from capturing the imagination of
<br>the Spanish electorate, along with a consistent
<br>underestimation of the political skill of the Zapatero
<br>government. It may take an internal revolution in the party
<br>or a significant recalibration of strategy for the PP to come
<br>back in the immediate future. End summary.
<br>
<br>----------------
<br>No to Everything
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Since losing the March 2004 elections, the Partido
<br>Popular, led by Mariano Rajoy and his team of veterans from
<br>the government of Jose Maria Aznar, has struggled to make
<br>headway against the ruling Socialist Party (PSOE) and the
<br>government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Blaming the PP
<br>loss on the March 11 train bombings and the evil machinations
<br>of the Socialists, Embassy PP contacts have consistently
<br>seemed to think that their election loss was really a
<br>mistake, a massive "misunderstanding" on the part of the
<br>electorate, ignoring the very real issues voters disagreed
<br>with them on: the war in Iraq -- which 90% of Spaniards
<br>opposed -- and, importantly, the Aznar government's handling
<br>of the March 11 attacks. The party has spent the last two
<br>years trying to win support by harassing the Zapatero
<br>government on everything it does (including when it is
<br>cooperating with the USG).
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) PP contacts have told us that their party strategy has
<br>been to attack the government at every turn. These attacks
<br>made ideological sense when the PP criticized the government
<br>on issues such as gay marriage, education reform (reducing
<br>the influence of the Catholic Church) or even in opposing GOS
<br>policy on Cuba and Venezuela. However, the PP also chose to
<br>take the government to task over Spanish military presence in
<br>Afghanistan and the participation of the Spanish frigate
<br>Alvaro Basan in the US Theodore Roosevelt battle group in the
<br>Persian Gulf, policies of this government which support US
<br>goals. The PP's attacks on these policies were therefore
<br>inconsistent with their own stated aims.
<br>
<br>--------
<br>The Hook
<br>--------
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) According to numerous public opinion polls, the PP
<br>made little or no dent (beyond its own base) in the
<br>government's popularity with its attack strategy, until a
<br>truly divisive issue came about: the reform of the Catalan
<br>Autonomy Statute ("Estatut" in the Catalan language). As the
<br>Catalans tried to declare in the legal document defining
<br>their relations with Madrid that they constitute a "nation,"
<br>many Spaniards wanted to know why the government seemed to be
<br>letting them pull out of the Spanish nation they supposedly
<br>already belonged to. In addition, the new Estatut was to give
<br>Catalonia broad fiscal independence, beyond what any other
<br>region of Spain had ever been granted. While the issue of the
<br>Estatut did not worry all Spaniards, enough were concerned
<br>that government approval ratings began to fall. This was
<br>exacerbated last autumn by floods of Sub-Saharan would-be
<br>immigrants charging Spanish borders at Ceuta and Melilla, as
<br>well as by speculation that the Socialist government was
<br>holding talks with Basque terrorist group ETA.
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) The Estatut, immigration and terrorism concerns gave
<br>the PP the hook it needed to be able to craft a message that
<br>might help it benefit from the government's falling
<br>popularity. Rajoy, Catalan PP leader Josep Pique, and
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000934 002 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>national leaders such as PP Secretary General Angel Acebes
<br>and Parliamentary Spokesman Eduardo Zaplana began speaking of
<br>national unity, equality for all Spaniards (in other words,
<br>no special privileges for Catalans and Basques), and joining
<br>together to put forth a strong face internationally
<br>(harkening back to the Aznar days, when the PP says Spain had
<br>more prestige both within the European Union as well as on
<br>the wider international stage). Nonetheless, while government
<br>popularity continued to fall, the PP did not pick up any
<br>support for itself with this message. And now, the ETA
<br>ceasefire has diminished public concerns about negotiating
<br>with the Basque group, and raised Zapatero's poll numbers
<br>substantially, by as much as eight percentage points in one
<br>poll.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Interestingly, PP leaders do not seem persuaded of the
<br>need to change the message, influence the poll numbers or
<br>attract more swing voters. Zaplana told the Ambassador on
<br>March 29 that the PP base would likely carry the party in any
<br>future elections (once again reflecting the PP belief that
<br>the 2004 loss was a one-off fluke), and that it was important
<br>to take care of that base. In a meeting with the Ambassador,
<br>Acebes explained that the PP's platform was one of Spanish
<br>unity, stable public administration, and a solid economic
<br>plan. The PP claims repeatedly that this platform is one of
<br>principle, whose correctness will be recognized in time by
<br>the electorate. Meanwhile, it continues to paint a picture of
<br>gloom and doom for the country under the Zapatero, with Aznar
<br>claiming that the "Balkanization of Spain" is near, with an
<br>independent Catalonia and Basque Country. It is true that the
<br>message and apocalyptic image rally the PP base Zaplana spoke
<br>of, a base that is somewhat larger than PSOE's, and most
<br>non-PP Spaniards certainly do not want to see the break up of
<br>Spain. Nevertheless, the Socialists' poll numbers rise.
<br>
<br>----------
<br>Leadership
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) A key reason the PP was not able to capitalize on the
<br>PSOE poll decline is its top leadership, with personalities
<br>ranging from lackluster to radioactive. The principal leaders
<br>of the PP were all close to former President Jose Maria
<br>Aznar, and are closely associated with the Aznar era. During
<br>the 2004 elections, before the March 11 attacks, association
<br>with Aznar was a positive, given the President's popularity.
<br>His former Vice President Mariano Rajoy was expected to sweep
<br>to victory as leader of the party. But since the attacks, the
<br>team has been tainted by the Aznar government's handling of
<br>the aftermath of the March 11 bombings, when it claimed that
<br>Basque terrorist group ETA was responsible and appeared to
<br>keep information on Islamist involvement from the public.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Rajoy is generally considered a competent and
<br>intelligent leader, but not especially charismatic. Acebes,
<br>who was Interior Minister in March 2004, is viewed in a
<br>particularly negative light because of his direct involvement
<br>in the handling of the attacks. Zaplana is also closely
<br>identified with the Aznar legacy, and is often criticized for
<br>his very conservative stance on most issues (he recently
<br>commented in a congressional debate on Vice President Maria
<br>Teresa Fernandez de la Vega's wardrobe choices, to feminist
<br>indignation). (See reftel A for more on Acebes and Zaplana.)
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) And then there is the ever-present former president,
<br>Jose Maria Aznar, who carries only a ceremonial title in the
<br>Partido Popular, but who casts his large shadow over
<br>everything the party does (see reftel B). After an extremely
<br>successful eight years in office, during which the Spanish
<br>economy flourished and Spain's standing in the world
<br>increased substantially, Aznar stepped down as party leader
<br>and appointed Mariano Rajoy his successor. Because of his
<br>success, he is still enormously admired within the party.
<br>When Aznar enters a room full of PP activists, a hush falls
<br>over the crowd. When Aznar walked into a book presentation
<br>for PP Parliamentarian (and self-proclaimed "shadow Foreign
<br>Minister") Gustavo de Aristegui's latest book, "Jihad in
<br>Spain," Aristegui gave a spontaneous speech on how Aznar had
<br>been his inspiration. In his first meeting with Ambassador
<br>Aguirre on December 15, 2005, Aznar claimed that he and his
<br>think tank FAES were careful not to interfere in national
<br>political battles; yet, in reality, at every opportunity,
<br>Aznar leverages his past influence (including his access to
<br>high-level USG officials) to affect current political
<br>discourse. And because of his cult status within the party
<br>ranks, the current leadership of the party has difficulty
<br>setting the course.
<br>
<br>-------------------------
<br>Underestimating the Enemy
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000934 003 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) All of the leaders of the PP machine -- Rajoy,
<br>Acebes, and Zaplana -- as well as former President Aznar
<br>speak of President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero with scorn
<br>and condescension. Zaplana told the Ambassador that Zapatero
<br>is full of himself and has too much confidence in his ability
<br>to maneuver politically, particularly in an election
<br>campaign. Aznar called him "weak and vacillating" (reftel B).
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) In reality, while the question of whether Zapatero's
<br>policies are intelligent or correct is certainly open for
<br>discussion, it is clear that the government has outmaneuvered
<br>the opposition on the two most controversial issues of this
<br>parliamentary session: the Catalan Statute and the future of
<br>ETA. Zapatero united at the last moment with the centrist
<br>Catalan nationalist party Convergencia i Unio, working all
<br>night with party leader Artur Mas to hammer out an accord
<br>agreeable to both sides and passable in Parliament. The PP
<br>opposed the agreement, leaving it isolated in Parliament with
<br>the ultra-nationalist Catalan party ERC, the only two parties
<br>to vote against the text.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) After the PP spent months accusing the government of
<br>"negotiating with terrorists" by talking to ETA, the group
<br>announced a ceasefire, using some of the least demanding
<br>language ever seen in its communiques. Polls indicate that
<br>swing voters are turning toward the government, and around
<br>64% of Spaniards say the government should look into the
<br>possibility of peace negotiations and the PP should join in
<br>that effort. The PP has found itself obligated to cooperate
<br>with Zapatero in pursuit of peace, with little hope of
<br>political gain. If the ceasefire turns out to be permanent,
<br>the Zapatero government will get the credit for peace. Yet if
<br>ETA begins demanding too much in negotiations and the PP
<br>turns against the process, it could be blamed for the
<br>failure. This supposedly weak president has managed
<br>completely to isolate the more politically experienced
<br>opposition on both issues. And if, as post suspects, Zapatero
<br>manages to keep negotiations with ETA going until after the
<br>general elections expected in early 2008 (or if he succeeds
<br>outright in bringing peace through negotiation), he will be
<br>difficult to defeat, given the continued strength of the
<br>economy and the prospect of the end of ETA after almost 50
<br>years of existence.
<br>
<br>-----------
<br>Revolution?
<br>-----------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Given the rigid structure of political parties in
<br>Spain, barring internal party revolution, it is nearly
<br>impossible for politicians to come to leadership in a party
<br>without working their way through the ranks and spending
<br>years paying homage to their elders. An internal PP
<br>revolution is not impossible, however: if the party continues
<br>to underestimate the governing party and fails to put forth a
<br>strategy to win votes, future election losses -- perhaps in
<br>2008 -- will force radical change in the leadership. In such
<br>a case, certainly Acebes and Zaplana would have to depart
<br>center stage, and probably most of the former ministers from
<br>the Aznar government.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) There are several PP personalities who would be
<br>well-positioned in the event of such a revolution. They are
<br>slightly more centrist on social issues, solidly conservative
<br>on economic issues, with wide cross-over appeal to PSOE
<br>voters. All have extensive and successful experience in
<br>public administration.
<br>
<br>--Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon: Consistently one of the most
<br>popular politicians in Spain, according to opinion polls, the
<br>mayor of Madrid has nonetheless not been in the inner circle
<br>within his own party, and is despised by the far right wing
<br>of the PP. He has challenged party orthodoxy on several
<br>occasions, supporting non-consensus candidates for leadership
<br>positions and criticizing his party's time in government.
<br>After Madrid lost its bid to host the Olympic Games in 2012,
<br>when several PP politicians outrageously blamed the loss on
<br>the PSOE government's deteriorated relationship with the
<br>United States, Gallardon -- who had spearheaded the bid --
<br>commented, "If anyone is to blame, it is me. Don't let anyone
<br>place the responsibility anywhere else; I assume it all." In
<br>his speech at the PP national convention in March 2006, he
<br>proposed that his party look at the possibility of
<br>"neutralizing the radical discourse... that is taking over,
<br>and to reinvent it using a moderating message to reassure the
<br>citizens... We need to fight for the things we need to fight
<br>for, but we cannot let dogmatic attitudes carry us away to
<br>dogmatism. Our place is with the people, with their real
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000934 004 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>concerns..." With statements such as these, Gallardon comes
<br>across to swing voters (and to many Socialists) as
<br>principled, rather than partisan. After eight years as
<br>President of the Madrid Region and now three years as mayor,
<br>he has extensive political and administrative experience. His
<br>controversial urban renewal plan for Madrid, which has caused
<br>great upheaval on the highways and in the subways of the
<br>city, is still a wildcard, as many Madrilenos (and Embassy
<br>employees) spend hours in traffic jams around construction
<br>sites all over the city. If the work comes out well, however,
<br>the renewal of Madrid could be a strong positive for
<br>Gallardon's political ambitions.
<br>
<br>--Francisco Camps: Camps, anointed by Eduardo Zaplana,
<br>followed in his footsteps to become President of the
<br>Generalitat Valenciana (Valencia Region) and regional PP
<br>president. Since he was elected in 2003, he has fallen out
<br>with his former mentor and worked hard to forge his own
<br>political identity, both within the Generalitat and
<br>nationally. After he worked across parties to agree on a the
<br>reform of the Valencia Regional Statute in 2005, he has
<br>become the PP poster child for bipartisan cooperation, the
<br>party's proof on the national stage that it really can work
<br>with the opposition party. Though still relatively young, his
<br>national stature has grown substantially, and he seems a good
<br>candidate to move into the PP national leadership in the
<br>event of a major shake-up.
<br>
<br>--Esperanza Aguirre: President of the Madrid Region as well
<br>as regional PP president, Aguirre has been very close to the
<br>current PP inner circle (and a sworn enemy of Gallardon),
<br>serving as Aznar's Education Minister during his first term,
<br>and President of the Senate during his second. Nonetheless,
<br>she retains a wider base and, because of her regional
<br>experience, a certain distance that would likely allow her to
<br>take on a leadership role in the party in a time of change,
<br>despite her ties to the old guard. She describes herself as a
<br>"neoliberal," but has advocated a certain pragmatism on
<br>social issues when dealing with the Zapatero government, for
<br>example describing the PP leadership's insistence in taking
<br>the new gay marriage law to the constitutional court as
<br>"politically inopportune." Because of her extensive political
<br>experience and national stature, she could be good transition
<br>leader in a redirected Partido Popular.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) All three of these politicians are expected to re-win
<br>their positions in regional and municipal elections coming up
<br>in 2007, consolidating Madrid and Valencia as PP strongholds.
<br>The current PP leadership hopes these elections will give the
<br>party the push it needs nationally to win national elections
<br>in 2008. In the two years left before the elections, there
<br>may yet be surprises that would give the PP a real advantage:
<br>if ETA negotiations break down, or if the strong Spanish
<br>economy falters, the PP could find its chance to take votes
<br>away from Zapatero. With peace on the horizon and a strong
<br>enconomy, however, on their current trajectory Zapatero and
<br>PSOE look well-placed to win again, perhaps even with an
<br>increased majority. At that point, the PP would have to start
<br>looking at these regional leaders to take it in a new
<br>direction nationally.
