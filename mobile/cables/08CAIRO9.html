<br>SUBJECT: CODEL VOINOVICH MEETING WITH EGIS CHIEF SOLIMAN 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stuart Jones 
<br>Reasons: 1.4 (B) and (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary.  EGIS Chief Omar Soliman told Ambassador and 
<br>a visiting Codel led by Senator George Voinovich December 31 
<br>that he is optimistic progress will be made on 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.  However, Soliman was 
<br>concerned with continuing Israeli criticism of Egyptian 
<br>anti-smuggling efforts.  He was worried that the Egyptians 
<br>would not be able to work out an arrangement with the 
<br>Israelis for Hajj pilgrims to return to Gaza.  On Iran, 
<br>Soliman said that the USG's release of the National 
<br>Intelligence Estimate had altered the calculus through which 
<br>Arab states are interacting with Iran.  On Iraq argued that 
<br>the Iraqi government needed to amend its constitution and 
<br>that Prime Minister Malaki should not deal with the Iraqi 
<br>people in a "sectarian way."  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) Soliman led off the New Year's Eve meeting by telling 
<br>the Codel that the region is at a special, critical juncture. 
<br> Egypt is America's partner.  Sometimes we have our 
<br>differences.  But Egypt will continue to provide the USG with 
<br>its knowledge and expertise on the critical regional issues, 
<br>such as Lebanon and Iraq.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
<br>remains the core issue; Soliman contended a peaceful 
<br>resolution would be a "big blow" to terrorist organizations 
<br>that use the conflict as a pretext.  For this reason, 
<br>President Mubarak is committed to ending the Israeli-Arab 
<br>"stalemate." 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) Soliman applauded the Administration's efforts, 
<br>commenting that Annapolis had given hope and begun a process. 
<br> The timing is right for progress based on four factors. 
<br>First, the PA leadership is moderate and willing to 
<br>negotiate.  Second, Hamas is isolated and politically cut off 
<br>in Gaza.  Third, the Israelis are ready for peace; Soliman 
<br>assessed that the GOI coalition is broad and strong, and 
<br>larger than Rabin's coalition of the mid-nineties.  Fourth, 
<br>Arab states are ready to see an end to "the struggle." 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) Soliman stressed that Egypt stands ready to help the 
<br>U.S. effort.  The GOE knows both the Palestinians and the 
<br>Israelis, and knows the obstacles to peace.  Soliman 
<br>recommended two steps be taken. First, both the Israelis and 
<br>Palestinians must be pressed hard to sign an agreement, which 
<br>the U.S. and international community could endorse, to be 
<br>implemented at the proper time.  Second, the U.S. should 
<br>insist that "phase one" of the Roadmap should be completed 
<br>before the end of 2008. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) Israeli-Palestinian Conflict:  Soliman opined that the 
<br>Palestinian Authority was ready to sign an agreement, but 
<br>that establishment of a state may take between 1-3 years. 
<br>While Hamas is isolated politically and unable to stop an 
<br>Israeli-PA agreement, it remains entrenched in Gaza, and it 
<br>was unclear to Soliman how long that would last.  At one 
<br>point in the discussion, Soliman seemed to imply Hamas may 
<br>remain in control of Gaza for more than a year; at another 
<br>juncture, he told Senator Voinovich that if negotiations 
<br>proceeded briskly, Hamas may be forced to cede power in Gaza 
<br>in 3-4 months.  The bottom line for Hamas, according to 
<br>Soliman, is that they must be forced to choose between 
<br>remaining a resistance movement or joining the political 
<br>process.  They cannot have it both ways, he said. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) Palestinian training: Soliman reiterated GOE 
<br>willingness to train and support Palestinian security forces. 
<br> He claimed that the GOE had training facilities ready, but 
<br>that he was waiting for an answer from U.S. Security 
<br>Coordinator General Keith Dayton.  (Note: We have advised 
<br>Soliman that initial training of Palestinian security forces 
<br>will take place in Jordan, and that we will revisit the 
<br>option of training in Egypt this spring.  End note).  He 
<br>continued that the GOE would keep pressure on Hamas but will 
<br>maintain "low-level" contacts with Hamas.  Egypt, he said, 
<br>wants Hamas isolated.  The Qassam rocket attacks must stop. 
<br>When they do stop, the GOE will ask Israel to "meet quiet 
<br>with quiet." 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S)  Border issues:  Senator Voinovich asked Soliman why 
<br>the Israelis continue to report problems with Egypt's 
<br>anti-smuggling efforts.  Soliman said that the Israelis do 
<br>not complain to him directly, and that GOI-GOE cooperation 
<br>and exchange of information continues.  He was at a loss as 
<br>to why Israeli politicians continue to criticize Egypt 
<br>publicly.  The GOE would like the USG to be included in the 
<br>GOI-GOE LAWIO discussions, but the Israelis continue to 
<br>object.  "They don't want a witness in the room," Soliman 
<br>said.  Nevertheless, Soliman was willing to turn the page. 
<br>"We have a short time to reach peace.  We need it.  We need 
<br>to wake up in the morning with no news of terrorism, no 
<br>explosions, and no news of more deaths.  We want everyone 
<br>happy.  That is the Egyptian dream." 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) Syria:  Congressman Turner asked if Iran and/or Syria 
<br>might be play a spoiler role.  Soliman answered that Syria 
<br>wants desperately to halt the United Nations special tribunal 
<br>on the Hariri assassination.  At the same time, the SARG is 
<br>ready to negotiate with the Israelis, and Soliman believed 
<br>that the GOI also is ready.  Syria, Soliman said, can be 
<br>induced to play a constructive role but added that there are 
<br>no guarantees, however, on Syrian performance. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) NIE:  Regarding the USG's National Intelligence 
<br>Estimate of Iran's nuclear program, Soliman was concerned 
<br>that many in the Arab world were recalculating their position 
<br>vis a vis Iran based on an assumption that the NIE 
<br>represented a USG policy shift.  Soliman said the Egyptians 
<br>are working to correct this misimpression among Arab states. 
<br>"We tell the Arab world:  Don't be happy with the NIE and 
<br>don't warm up to Iran. We know that the United States will 
<br>never allow Iran to have a nuclear bomb." 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) Iran:  Soliman said that Iran remains a significant 
<br>threat to Egypt.  It continues to influence Shiaa in Iraq and 
<br>the Gulf.  Iran is supporting Jihad and spoiling peace, and 
<br>has supported extremists in Egypt previously.  If they were 
<br>to support the Muslim Brotherhood this would make them "our 
<br>enemy," he said.  The GOE continues to press the Iranian 
<br>regime to turn over extremists given "safe harbor" in Iran. 
<br>This issue, he said, will remain an obstacle to improving 
<br>Egyptian-Iranian relations.  (Soliman met with Iranian former 
<br>nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani earlier in the week. 
<br>Larijani was in Egypt on a week-long "private visit." 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S) Iraq: Soliman said he remains concerned that the 
<br>Maliki government in Iraq is not representing all Iraqis 
<br>(i.e. the Sunni population).  The GOE has urged Maliki not to 
<br>deal with the Iraqi people in a sectarian way, and to amend 
<br>to constitution to allow greater Sunni representation.  In 
<br>addition, the Iraqi government must remove militias from the 
<br>ranks of the army and police.  In the long run, Soliman did 
<br>not think that the decrease in violence would be sustainable 
<br>absent these two steps.  In addition, Iranian influence is 
<br>problematic.  Soliman said that the GOE had worked to 
<br>reconcile 21 clans and tribes in Iraq, with good results, and 
<br>that this kind of efforts had to continue.  He assessed that 
<br>both Sistani and Sadr were practical men, and able to be 
<br>dealt with. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (U) Delegation composition: 
<br> 
<br>Senator George Voinovich (R-OH) 
<br>Congressman Mike Turner (R-OH) 
<br>Congressman Steve Pearce (R-NM) 
<br>Congressman Rob Bishop (R-UT) 
<br>Congressman Phil Gingrey (R-GA) 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (U) The delegation did not clear this message.
