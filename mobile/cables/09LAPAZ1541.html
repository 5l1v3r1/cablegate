<br>SUBJECT: EU WEIGHS ITS COUNTER-NARCOTICS EFFORTS IN BOLIVIA 
<br>
<br>REF: LA PAZ 1494 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge John Creamer, reasons 1.4 b and d. 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Our exchanges with European Union 
<br>representatives and an EU working group paper underscore 
<br>growing European recognition of the need for intensified 
<br>cooperation on counter-narcotics in Bolivia. The Europeans 
<br>note increases in coca production, fear the introduction of 
<br>third country criminal organizations, and recognize the loss 
<br>in GOB capabilities with the expulsion of DEA last year. 
<br>Among proposals under consideration by the EU are increases 
<br>in technical assistance and alternative development, 
<br>development of EU member state law enforcement cooperation, 
<br>better internal coordination, and strengthening CN 
<br>cooperation with neighboring countries. EU officials are 
<br>also keen to reopen the UNODC office in La Paz, and seek U.S. 
<br>assistance in pressing the UN to do so quickly. Although EU 
<br>counter-narcotics efforts have so far been relatively modest 
<br>and focused on alternative development, EU officials 
<br>generally share our assessments and are considering stepping 
<br>up their engagement, including on law enforcement (by 
<br>individual member states) and by pushing GOB reductions in 
<br>coca cultivation. End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) An internal policy paper prepared by the 
<br>recently-formed EU Drugs Working Group (made up of 
<br>representatives from local EU missions) highlights European 
<br>concerns about the worsening counter-narcotics situation in 
<br>Bolivia and the Europeans' interest in doing more. The EU 
<br>paper notes the growth of cocaine use in Europe -- the 
<br>ultimate destination for most Bolivian cocaine -- and the 
<br>troubling increase in coca production in Bolivia and other 
<br>Andean countries (the EU estimates 32-34,000 hectares under 
<br>production in Bolivia, slightly higher than the UNODC's 
<br>figure of 30,500). GOB efforts to control the legal coca 
<br>market are seriously flawed, the EU notes, while Bolivian 
<br>government interdiction remains hampered by the loss of DEA's 
<br>logistical and intelligence support (following DEA's 
<br>expulsion in November 2008). A major European concern -- 
<br>also voiced by EU Ambassador Bell and others to the Charge -- 
<br>is that Colombian and Mexican cartels will enter the Bolivian 
<br>market, expanding production and increasing 
<br>trafficking-related violence. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Amid sustained domestic pressure for increases in 
<br>legal production, the EU has provided one million euros to 
<br>fund a GOB survey of legal coca demand and other related 
<br>studies (the "Comprehensive Study on the Coca Leaf in 
<br>Bolivia"). Ambassador Bell explained that the full results 
<br>of the legal demand survey will not be available before July 
<br>2010, although the GOB may attempt to revise its legislation 
<br>governing legal production (including an increase from the 
<br>current 12,000 hectares authorized) before then. Bell 
<br>suggested that any estimate of 20,000 hectares or less should 
<br>prove useful in pressing the GOB to cut coca cultivation. 
<br>Separately, UK Ambassador Baker voiced disappointment that 
<br>the study will not be ready until next summer, but stressed 
<br>that the international community should not wait until then 
<br>to press the Bolivians on this issue. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) EU officials acknowledge that their counter-narcotics 
<br>assistance is small scale compared to the aid the U.S. has 
<br>provided. According to their policy paper, most assistance 
<br>has gone toward alternative development (the European 
<br>Commission has provided nearly 50 million euros, Belgium and 
<br>Spain several million euros each), with lesser amounts in 
<br>equipment donations (the U.K. gave the GOB $500,000 in 
<br>forensics equipment this year; Germany and Italy have also 
<br>provided small amounts of in-kind aid). The UK, Spain, 
<br>Italy, the Netherlands and France have provided limited CN 
<br>training to Bolivian police in recent years. Ambassador Bell 
<br>maintains that the EU cannot be involved directly in 
<br>eradication, but allowed that some eradication-related aid 
<br>may be possible (e.g., covering ancillary costs). 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) More critically, Ambassador Bell noted, the EU lacks 
<br>the capability to fill the law enforcement vacuum left by 
<br>DEA's expulsion, but EU members states can and should be 
<br>pressed to strengthen such cooperation, he said. The UK, 
<br>Spanish and visiting Swedish ambassadors have all 
<br>acknowledged privately that the EU's limited CN approach has 
<br>proven insufficient and needs to be expanded to include 
<br>direct support for law enforcement. Ambassador Baker 
<br>reported that the UK is currently undergoing an internal 
<br>review of its regional CN policy, to be completed by early 
<br>December, that will include consideration of new efforts in 
<br>this area. Additionally, the Europeans indicate that they 
<br>intend to step up consultation with neighboring states such 
<br>as Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, which are strengthening 
<br>their own cross-border counter-narcotics cooperation with the 
<br>GOB. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The EU's paper proposes a number of CN measures for 
<br>the near term, including increased funding for technical 
<br>assistance (e.g., on money laundering and judicial support), 
<br>expansion of alternative development aid, and creation of 
<br>mechanisms to aid the GOB in evaluating both its CN successes 
<br>and shortcomings. The EU working group also identified as a 
<br>priority better CN coordination, both internally and with 
<br>other international partners. Ambassador Baker amplified 
<br>that point, maintaining that a coordinated, united stance 
<br>will be critical to overcoming Bolivian President Morales's 
<br>apparent resistance to reversing the growth in coca 
<br>cultivation. The Europeans also see the re-opening of the 
<br>UNODC office in La Paz (closed for budgetary reasons) as key 
<br>to strengthened coordination. Ambassador Bell reported that 
<br>the EU has contributed 500,000 euros for UNODC projects and 
<br>office funding and asked for U.S. help in pushing the UN to 
<br>open the office as soon as possible. (Note: We understand 
<br>from the UN that donor support will determine whether the 
<br>UNODC can return.) 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Comment: We see a welcome evolution in the EU's 
<br>approach toward counter-narcotics in Bolivia, as EU and EU 
<br>member state officials evince recognition of the need to move 
<br>beyond their relatively modest and narrowly-focused efforts 
<br>to date. The Europeans may be convinced that Morales does 
<br>not want Bolivia to be categorized as a narco-state, but they 
<br>are also clear-eyed about GOB shortcomings (in terms of 
<br>political will, capabilities and corruption), and understand 
<br>that the EU has to shoulder a greater share of the burden in 
<br>confronting these challenges. With policy limitations on 
<br>what the EU can do collectively, however, translating this 
<br>recognition into concrete action will take time, as well as 
<br>leadership from individual member states.
