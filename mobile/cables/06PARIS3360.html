<br>
<br>¶B. PARIS POINTS OF 5/16 
<br>
<br>Classified By: AMB Craig Stapleton for reasons 1.4 (B & D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: In a remarkably wide-ranging tour de force 
<br>equally remarkable for its candor, former finance minister 
<br>and leading Socialist party presidential candidate Dominique 
<br>Strauss-Kahn shared with Ambassador Stapleton May 16 his 
<br>views that: the Clearstream scandal is far from over; the 
<br>Socialist Party can win in the 2007 presidential elections 
<br>and that there will not be a repeat of 2002; his most 
<br>difficult hurdle in his quest for the presidency will be to 
<br>win his party's nomination over Segolene Royal; tackling 
<br>significant reform in France is all the more difficult for 
<br>being necessary; France's main problem is its current lack of 
<br>confidence in itself; and the Chirac presidency looks 
<br>increasingly to be marked by failure. End summary. 
<br>
<br>Clearstream and the Censure Motion 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>¶2. (C) In a May 16 meeting with the Ambassador, Former 
<br>finance minister, Socialist Party (PS) heavyweight and 
<br>presidential contender Dominique Strauss-Kahn (known here as 
<br>DSK) insisted on the seriousness of the censure motion vote 
<br>tabled earlier by the PS, to be voted on later the same 
<br>afternoon, in connection with the Clearstream scandal (see 
<br>also ref A). While the outcome was a foregone conclusion, 
<br>and such motions generally were little more than political 
<br>"theater" given the institutional realities of the Fifth 
<br>Republic, he asserted that it was nonetheless important. 
<br>This was especially so given the decision by some leading 
<br>center-right UMP governing party deputies (ref B) not to be 
<br>present for the vote and center-right UDF party president 
<br>Francois Bayrou's decision to vote for the censure motion. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Although DSK dismissed Bayrou's decision as political 
<br>posturing to maximize his own first-round presidential 
<br>election chances (DSK judged that Bayrou would receive only 
<br>6-9 percent of the first-round vote), he judged that an 
<br>alliance with the left -- even if Bayrou switched to 
<br>supporting the right in the second round -- could potentially 
<br>have significant ramifications for a left-right face-off in 
<br>the second round of the 2007 presidential elections. He 
<br>hedged about the impact in the end, however, noting that most 
<br>UDF voters were probably more to the right than their leaders. 
<br>
<br>2007 Between Center-Left and Center-Right 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (C) DSK was confident that the second round would be a 
<br>contest between the UMP and the PS, notwithstanding the 
<br>current popularity of extremist elements on the left and the 
<br>right. But voters had learned from the 2002 elections, where 
<br>their protest votes cost Jospin the elections. He predicted 
<br>that the PS candidate would garner around 22-23 percent, with 
<br>likely UMP candidate Sarkozy getting closer to 24-25 percent 
<br>of the first-round vote. Chirac's initial 2002 score of less 
<br>than 20 percent was, DSK asserted, an historical anomaly. 
<br>DSK was adamant that far-right National Front leader 
<br>Jean-Marie Le Pen would come in third. Even if he managed to 
<br>exceed his initial score of 2002, it would still not be 
<br>enough. 
<br>
<br>Villepin Will Survive, Good for Left 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>¶5. (C) DSK acknowledged when asked that it would probably be 
<br>better for the PS if Villepin stayed in office until the end 
<br>of Chirac's term, given that the prospects were for "one year 
<br>of nothing." Even if Chirac did decide to jettison Villepin, 
<br>it is not clear whom Chirac should name as a successor. DSK 
<br>concluded that, if the current government managed to survive 
<br>until the beginning of the World Cup in late June, then it 
<br>would sail through the July/August holiday period. When 
<br>September rolled around, the electorate would be more focused 
<br>on the 2007 presidential elections than trying to boot the 
<br>incumbent government out of office. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Asked if this meant that the Clearstream affair would 
<br>therefore soon be forgotten, DSK (in contrast to some) 
<br>responded that "this was only the beginning." He was struck 
<br>by secret investigator General Rondot's decision not to meet 
<br>with the investigating judges, commenting that "this meant 
<br>there was someone more he feared than the judges" (by 
<br>implication, with something to hide). Explaining, he added 
<br>that Rondot was a military guy who was obeying orders. 
<br>Someone had told him to stonewall, which is why he had gone 
<br>silent. Turning to a putative meeting on Clearstream between 
<br>Chirac and Sarkozy, he said Chirac had asked Sarkozy what the 
<br>risks were of Clearstream continuing, and Sarkozy had 
<br>responded "100 percent." DSK concluded that, although the 
<br>scandal might disappear from the public eye, the 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00003360 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>investigations would continue. He lamented that France was 
<br>not a more mature democracy like the U.S. DSK said that 
<br>Sarkozy had rightly understood that voters felt touched by 
<br>the scandal and were demanding justice, even if they could 
<br>not understand it fully. His dilemma was that, if he stayed 
<br>in the government, this would only bewilder voters and 
<br>reinforce their alienation. Chirac, DSK continued, could 
<br>have put an end to the story by changing prime ministers. 
<br>
<br>Government Dead in Water 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>¶7. (C) Turning to Villepin, DSK recalled his last press 
<br>conference during which he had touted small improvements in 
<br>the unemployment situation. But this did not fool anyone, he 
<br>asserted. DSK explained that it was difficult to flaunt a 
<br>tiny improvement in one area when, at the same time, the 
<br>overall economic situation was not good and deteriorating, 
<br>and social tensions were on the uptick. Moreover, the 
<br>controversy over the First Employment Contract, a measure of 
<br>little significance per se, had now made further reform 
<br>almost impossible. 
<br>
<br>Admiration for Sarkozy 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>¶8. (C) DSK agreed that the PS had benefited from the 
<br>Clearstream scandal, although he acknowledged that every 
<br>party or figure had skeletons in the closet. He nonetheless 
<br>complained that Sarkozy had overdone it in portraying himself 
<br>as a victim and that this would reap little sympathy on the 
<br>left. DSK characterized Sarkozy's overall strategy simply as 
<br>one of being determined to win, but readily admitted that he 
<br>was an extremely talented politician who had managed 
<br>successfully to turn voters' concerns about growing crime, 
<br>for example, to his own benefit. DSK expressed astonishment 
<br>that Sarkozy was running on a platform of claiming that he 
<br>"knew the solutions to France's problems, but would not 
<br>reveal or implement them until elected." This was a 
<br>permissible strategy for the opposition party, he complained, 
<br>but was hard to sustain for someone already in power. 
<br>
<br>Chirac Prefers Left to Sarkozy 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>¶9. (C) DSK also judged that Sarkozy had positioned himself 
<br>so far to the right that he would have difficulty moving back 
<br>to the center. He claimed there was a large number of Chirac 
<br>supporters who would not vote for Sarkozy as president. DSK 
<br>vigorously affirmed that Chirac was "an objective ally" who 
<br>would prefer a victory of the left to having Sarkozy succeed 
<br>him for a number of reasons: he did not deem Sarkozy a 
<br>"worthy" successor (just as Mitterrand had favored Chirac 
<br>over Jospin); he was a "radical-socialist" (in the French 
<br>sense) at heart in any case, in contrast to Sarkozy, the free 
<br>market "liberal." Chirac also feared Sarkozy was more likely 
<br>than the left to pursue him in the courts for past scandals 
<br>in which he was implicated. (Note: The French Radical party 
<br>fits loosely into the Christian democratic tradition of 
<br>capitalism with a strong social component.) 
<br>
<br>Royal Leading for Now, But... 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>¶10. (C) Asked about the presidential nomination process in 
<br>the PS, DSK referred to Segolene Royal's commanding lead in 
<br>public opinion polls as a "collective hallucination" and 
<br>reminded the Ambassador that, in France, those who were poll 
<br>leaders six months before the elections -- Giscard d'Estaing 
<br>in 1981, Balladur in 1995, and Jospin in 2002 were the most 
<br>recent examples -- had invariably lost. DSK predicted that 
<br>Royal would eventually crumble and that, if nominated by the 
<br>PS, would not survive against Sarkozy. He noted wryly in 
<br>that Sarkozy had already reached the same conclusion, which 
<br>explained why he continued to extol her qualities as a 
<br>potential candidate. DSK added that while she had a decent 
<br>chance of winning the "internal" debate within the PS, she 
<br>would have much more difficulty winning the "external" debate 
<br>with Sarkozy, even with good advisors and handlers. 
<br>
<br>Not of Presidential Timber 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>¶11. (C) Within the PS, according to DSK, Royal was not as 
<br>popular, as she drew much of her public support from the 
<br>right and center. He claimed that 80 percent of the party 
<br>was not behind her, and dismissed announcements of support 
<br>from various mayors as falling far short of a snowball 
<br>effect. DSK asserted that activists in the party "sensed," 
<br>for example, that Royal could not imagine herself in the 
<br>international arena, for example, negotiating gas agreements 
<br>with Putin; good advisors would not be able to make up for 
<br>her rather shallow experience. He noted that she had not 
<br>become the President of the Poitou-Charentes region by 
<br>defeating former prime minister Raffarin, as has been 
<br>claimed; she had simply won the seat that he had vacated. 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00003360 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>She had never won a tough election battle, he contended, and 
<br>there were no assurances that she would be able to do so. He 
<br>described her several times as "fragile but not in the 
<br>feminine sense," not up to a real debate on the issues. The 
<br>problem, he admitted readily, was that she was currently 
<br>popular and that even her most banal pronouncements -- such 
<br>as being a "Blairite" in the positive sense when it was he, 
<br>DSK, who had carried this label for years -- were greeted as 
<br>major media events. 
<br>
<br>DSK's Strategy for Winning 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>¶12. (C) Asked to outline his own strategy for winning the 
<br>presidency, DSK said that the party was currently divided in 
<br>thirds between supporters of Royal, of him, and of former 
<br>prime minister Laurent Fabius. His hope was that a debate -- 
<br>the holding of which he admitted would be difficult to 
<br>arrange -- among candidates within the party would produce a 
<br>choice based on substance and that candidate's potential for 
<br>defeating Sarkozy. He did not believe Royal could win on 
<br>either count. New PS members had joined on the basis of 
<br>being able to participate in the outcome, and this could not 
<br>occur without a debate; if Royal tried to prevent a debate, 
<br>then she would be perceived as hiding something. DSK 
<br>summarized his strategy as getting past the highest hurdle 
<br>first: the key for him would be to come in at least second in 
<br>the initial first round of the party's selection (not at all 
<br>a sure thing), and then win in the second round. (Note: The 
<br>clear implication was that if DSK and Royal survive the first 
<br>round, the supporters of Fabius would shift their support to 
<br>DSK in the second round.) Similarly, in the presidential 
<br>elections, if DSK made it to the second round (which he 
<br>believed would be possible for whoever was the PS candidate), 
<br>then he would be the best positioned to defeat Sarkozy in the 
<br>final round. 
<br>
<br>Jospin Out; Hollande's Mistakes 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>¶13. (C) DSK did not believe that former prime minister 
<br>Jospin would be the party's nominee, as he could not seek the 
<br>nomination directly and the party was unlikely to offer it to 
<br>him on a platter absent some serious crisis. DSK believed 
<br>that he would benefit most from Jospin supporters, given 
<br>Jospin's opposition to Royal and Fabius. DSK was critical of 
<br>First Secretary Hollande, saying that he had yielded to the 
<br>temptation of being a presidential candidate himself, when 
<br>more even-handed treatment of other candidates would have 
<br>assured him a place as prime minister in any new government 
<br>and kept alive his presidential aspirations for the future. 
<br>Hollande was described as a good tactician but poor 
<br>strategist, who would be left out in the cold if Royal won, 
<br>given his status as her domestic partner. DSK claimed that 
<br>Hollande had initially proposed Royal's candidacy as a way to 
<br>preserve his own chances, but that the sorcerer's apprentice 
<br>had taken on a life of her own. This attempted 
<br>"privatisation" of the party's agenda had damaged Hollande's 
<br>reputation. 
<br>
<br>Domestic Situation Key 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>¶14. (C) Looking to the 2007 presidential elections, DSK 
<br>criticized Villepin for putting students in the streets over 
<br>a triviality (the CPE, or First Employment Contract) rather 
<br>than something important and more worthy of a fight. The 
<br>main issue, DSK said, is economic growth, not this or that 
<br>reform of the labor code. France needed to focus on basic 
<br>reforms, such as of its universities, not on whether a youth 
<br>under 26 could be fired without a proper explanation. Given 
<br>the overall sense of insecurity in France, particularly among 
<br>parents who feared that their children would have worse lives 
<br>than they, DSK thought foreign policy would play only a very 
<br>modest role in the elections, notwithstanding the public's 
<br>interest in Iran and terrorism. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Nor did DSK believe that Europe would be a major 
<br>election issue, since France was currently too obsessed with 
<br>its own situation to look more broadly even toward Europe. 
<br>DSK said the 2007 presidential elections would evolve around 
<br>the same set of issues, with the left and right platforms 
<br>being mirror images of each other. Sarkozy would emphasize 
<br>immigration and security, and the left would emphasize 
<br>employment and integration. He predicted that if Sarkozy 
<br>succeeded in getting voters to focus on security, then he 
<br>would win, whereas the left would need to emphasize the 
<br>economy. He said the left had lost in 2002 because it had 
<br>allowed the right to set the agenda. 
<br>
<br>Whoever Wins Will Have it Tough 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>¶16. (C) DSK said that whoever won the 2007 elections would 
<br>have little room for maneuver in effecting change. Things 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00003360 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>would not be as easy as in 1997, when it was possible to 
<br>stimulate the economy out of recession. The left would need 
<br>to take risks if elected, and work harder to reform the 
<br>system. It would be critical to act quickly, based on the 
<br>mandate of an election. For the mid-term, DSK cited the 
<br>importance of more investment in growth sectors. Over the 
<br>shorter term, it was important for French companies to regain 
<br>confidence in France. He blamed Chirac for creating anxiety 
<br>in business and cynicism among the elites. Part of Royal's 
<br>current success was that she had tapped into the country's 
<br>need to have pride in itself. DSK suggested that little 
<br>would remain of Chirac's European legacy besides a failed 
<br>referendum and a proposal to reduce the value-added tax for 
<br>French restaurants. France, he said, needed someone who 
<br>could show the way forward. Sarkozy could do that, he said, 
<br>but Royal would be unable to do so. There was not enough 
<br>"beef" there. 
<br>
<br>One Last Bold Step from Chirac? 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>¶17. (C) DSK concluded with the thought that it was not too 
<br>late for Chirac to show true leadership. He could quit now, 
<br>call for a renewal of France, call for early elections, and 
<br>announce his resignation for a date that would permit both 
<br>sides to prepare properly for them. In this way he could 
<br>serve France and save his reputation. DSK stopped there, 
<br>obviously concluding, but not saying, that Chirac would never 
<br>do it. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>¶18. (C) DSK was lively and engaging, full of good humor, and 
<br>remarkably modest and without pretensions. That may prove to 
<br>be his undoing. While he was openly critical of Royal, he 
<br>also readily admitted that she was doing many things right. 
<br>And while he clearly viewed himself as the right man to lead 
<br>France, he seemed reluctant to beat his own drum and was 
<br>spare with prescriptions about what he would do if chosen to 
<br>be France's next president. The impression left was that, 
<br>while he may be the most capable and qualified candidate 
<br>among the Socialists, he lacks the fire in the belly that 
<br>would propel him to victory. He is one of those who would 
<br>clearly be better governing than campaigning -- and therefore 
<br>may never get the chance to govern.
