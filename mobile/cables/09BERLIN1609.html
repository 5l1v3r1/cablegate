<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Dirk Niebel (FDP) was an odd pick as 
<br>Germany's new Development Minister -- he had no experience in 
<br>international development, and had previously suggested 
<br>abolishing the Development Ministry.  Now in charge, Niebel 
<br>has big shoes to fill, following on the heels of Heidemarie 
<br>Wieczorek-Zeul (SPD).  Important differences with his 
<br>predecessor are already apparent: he would like to integrate 
<br>Germany's development policy more closely with its foreign 
<br>and security policy, including in Afghanistan.  Niebel is 
<br>also a firm believer in free markets, and sees a successful 
<br>conclusion of the Doha Development Round as critical for 
<br>developing countries.  For Niebel, nothing is sacrosanct: he 
<br>intends to phase out German aid to China, which he regards as 
<br>no longer a developing country.  With the ministry under new 
<br>management, there may be additional opportunities for 
<br>collaboration between the United States and Germany on 
<br>development policy.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>DIRK WHO? 
<br>--------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (SBU) Dirk Niebel struck many as an unlikely choice for 
<br>Development Minister in the coalition government of 
<br>Chancellor Merkel's Christian Democratic Union 
<br>(CDU)/Christian Social Union (CSU) and Guido Westerwelle's 
<br>Free Democratic Party (FDP) (the "Black-Yellow" coalition). 
<br>A Hamburg native, Niebel's previous work experience includes 
<br>eight years as a paratrooper in the German armed forces, and 
<br>five years as a placement officer at a job center in 
<br>Heidelberg.  In 1998, he was elected to the Bundestag (lower 
<br>house of Parliament), where he became caucus spokesperson for 
<br>labor market policy and a member of the Labor Committee.  In 
<br>2005, FDP Chairman (and current Foreign Minister) Westerwelle 
<br>tapped him as FDP Secretary General -- a position he held 
<br>until Chancellor Merkel appointed him Development Minister in 
<br>November 2009.  As Secretary General, Niebel had called for 
<br>the elimination of the ministry he would later head, the 
<br>Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). 
<br>(NOTE: This option appears off the table for now. END NOTE) 
<br>Niebel succeeds Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul of the Social 
<br>Democratic Party (SPD), who headed BMZ for a record 11 years. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>CONNECTED SECURITY 
<br>------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (SBU) In a December 18 meeting with Ambassador Murphy, 
<br>Niebel said he intended to "make some changes at BMZ."  One 
<br>such change is linking development policy more closely with 
<br>foreign and security policy -- a concept he referred to as 
<br>"connected security."   Niebel told the Ambassador he planned 
<br>to coordinate very closely with Foreign Minister Guido 
<br>Westerwelle, and that he foresaw much greater cooperation 
<br>between BMZ and the German military in northern Afghanistan. 
<br>(NOTE: Days prior to the meeting with Ambassador Murphy, 
<br>Niebel had announced BMZ would increase civilian assistance 
<br>to Afghanistan by around 50 million euros, bringing Germany's 
<br>2009 total to over 260 million euros. END NOTE) 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (SBU) In a separate meeting several months ago, 
<br>Chancellery National Security Advisor Christoph Heusgen had 
<br>told us that BMZ under a Black-Yellow coalition would be less 
<br>wedded to "old" notions of doing development work.  This 
<br>assessment now appears to be accurate.   Wiezcorek-Zeul had 
<br>ensured that German development staff worked and lived in 
<br>separate compounds, away from provincial reconstruction teams 
<br>(PRTs) and other bases from which the Ministry of Defense, 
<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Interior 
<br>operated.  She even refused to ride in German military 
<br>vehicles when she visited Afghanistan.  This kind of 
<br>separation seems likely to end under Niebel, both physically 
<br>and substantively. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (SBU) Among other ideas Niebel brings to the table is a 
<br>plan to partner with third country donors like Israel on 
<br>projects in developing countries.  Niebel told the Ambassador 
<br>that Israel,s expertise in border protection could be shared 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001609  002.3 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>with African countries, for example.  By teaming up with 
<br>Germany, Israel could participate in certain capacity 
<br>building projects where it might not otherwise have access. 
<br> 
<br>LAISSEZ-FAIRE DEVELOPMENT 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (SBU) Shortly after becoming Minister, Niebel remarked 
<br>that his overall development philosophy was helping recipient 
<br>countries help themselves.  He regards the successful 
<br>conclusion of World Trade Organization's (WTO's) Doha 
<br>Development Round as especially meaningful for developing 
<br>countries.  "There is more money being lost by trade barriers 
<br>than all the development aid can make up for," he said.  This 
<br>perspective marks a noteworthy departure from the approach of 
<br>Wieczorek-Zeul, dubbed "red Heide" for her affiliation with 
<br>the Young Socialists years ago. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (SBU) Niebel also opposes a proposed tax on international 
<br>financial transactions to fund development assistance.  Both 
<br>Chancellor Merkel and Wieczorek-Zeul had championed the 
<br>so-called "Tobin tax."  Citing "differences" within the 
<br>government on the issue, Niebel has reportedly ended BMZ's 
<br>participation in an international working group on the 
<br>proposed tax. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (SBU) Niebel is keen to reorient BMZ's assistance. 
<br>Reflecting on comments made publicly in his first days as 
<br>Minister, Niebel told Ambassador Murphy that Germany planned 
<br>to stop providing development assistance to China, currently 
<br>one of the largest recipients of German aid.  He added that 
<br>China was "only a developing country when it came to climate 
<br>change negotiations."  BMZ will carry out its existing aid 
<br>obligations to China only through next year.  The decision 
<br>has proved controversial, as BMZ's assistance to China had 
<br>reportedly benefitted German companies doing business there. 
<br> 
<br>TRAVEL PLANS 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (SBU) Niebel said he planned to spend the holidays in 
<br>Israel.  (NOTE: Niebel is a long-standing member of the 
<br>German-Israeli Society. END NOTE) His first official travel 
<br>to the developing world will be a late January trip to 
<br>"Rwanda, eastern Congo, Mozambique, Afghanistan and Asia." 
<br>The Ambassador suggested Niebel visit Washington to meet with 
<br>new USAID Administrator Shah once confirmed.  Niebel said he 
<br>would coordinate dates for the visit with the Embassy. 
<br> 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (SBU) Niebel takes charge of BMZ at a challenging time: 
<br>Germany will run its largest post-war deficit in 2010, and 
<br>pressure to rein in spending will strain every ministry. 
<br>Niebel's close relationship with Westerwelle should be an 
<br>asset, however, and could help minimize cuts on key 
<br>priorities.  The close relationship will also facilitate 
<br>Niebel's vision of integrating development policy with 
<br>foreign and security policy.  Since taking over at BMZ, 
<br>Niebel has increased assistance to Afghanistan, where Germany 
<br>was already the third largest donor, and appears open to 
<br>doing more in support of an integrated strategy in the north. 
<br> An early meeting between the new USAID Administrator, who 
<br>oversees the world's largest aid budget, and the new German 
<br>Development Minister, who oversees the world's second 
<br>largest, could be an important step in building stronger 
<br>U.S.-German cooperation on our top development priorities.
