<br>Subject: (s) germany requests release of xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>nonpaper to the german criminal customs office (zka)
<br>
<br>Ref: a. State 77660
<br>b. Berlin 1000
<br>
<br>Classified By: Global Affairs Unit Chief Don L. Brown for
<br>reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (u) this is an action request. Please see para 4.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) The German MFA requested USG permission to release
<br>the REF A nonpaper to the German Customs Office of Criminal
<br>Investigation (ZKA) (not/not for further dissemination) in
<br>support of a continued investigation. It appears as though
<br>the ZKA investigation into xxxxxxxxxxxx is still active,
<br>contrary to a previous MFA statement, but this case has not
<br>progressed to the German court system.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) On August 4, German MFA Export Control Division Desk
<br>Officer, Wiebke Wacker, told Global Affairs Officer that the
<br>ZKA had asked her office for additional information regarding
<br>the business dealings between xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>business and Iran's primary solid fuel missile developer, the
<br>Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group (SBIG). (Comment: Wacker had
<br>previously indicated (REF B) that the ZKA halted their
<br>investigation into xxxxxxxxxxxx due to a lack of
<br>evidence linking xxxxxxxxxxxx with SBIG. End Comment). In
<br>response to the ZKA request, Wacker informed the ZKA of the
<br>REF A nonpaper passed to her on July 21 but told them that
<br>she could release the information due to a restriction on
<br>third party dissemination stated in the nonpaper's caveat.
<br>She informed the ZKA that she would make the appropriate
<br>request through U.S. Embassy Berlin. (Comment: It should be
<br>noted that the REF A nonpaper was classified as SECRET//REL
<br>GERMANY, so there might not be any issue releasing this
<br>nonpaper to the ZKA. End Comment).
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Post requests Department guidance
<br>in responding to the dissemination request posed in paragraph
<br>
<br>¶3. Koenig<br>
