<br>SUBJECT: ADMIRAL MULLEN'S MEETING WITH EGIS CHIEF SOLIMAN
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey per 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. Key Points:
<br>
<br>- (S/NF) During an April 21 meeting with Chairman of the
<br>Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen, Egyptian
<br>General Intelligence Service Chief Omar Soliman explained
<br>that his overarching regional goal was combating radicalism,
<br>especially in Gaza, Iran, and Sudan.
<br>
<br>- (S/NF) On Gaza, Soliman said Egypt must "confront" Iranian
<br>attempts to smuggle arms to Gaza and "stop" arms smuggling
<br>through Egyptian territory.
<br>
<br>- (S/NF) Soliman shared his vision on Palestinian
<br>reconciliation and bringing the Palestinian Authority back to
<br>Gaza, saying "a Gaza in the hands of radicals will never be
<br>calm."
<br>
<br>- (S/NF) On Iran, Soliman said Egypt was "succeeding" in
<br>preventing Iran from funneling financial support to Hamas
<br>through Egypt. Soliman hoped that the U.S. could encourage
<br>Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions and stop interfering in
<br>regional affairs, but cautioned that Iran "must pay a price"
<br>for its actions.
<br>
<br>- (S/NF) Egypt is "very concerned" with stability in Sudan,
<br>Soliman said, and was focusing efforts on convincing the
<br>Chadean and Sudanese presidents to stop supporting each
<br>others' insurgencies, supporting negotiations between
<br>factions in Darfur, and implementing the Comprehensive Peace
<br>Agreement (CPA). "Egypt does not want a divided Sudan,"
<br>Soliman stressed.
<br>
<br>----
<br>Gaza
<br>----
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Soliman said radicalism was the "backbone" of
<br>regional security threats, adding that radicalism in Gaza
<br>posed a particularly serious threat to Egyptian national
<br>security. Soliman said Egypt must "confront" Iranian
<br>attempts to smuggle arms to Gaza and stop arms smuggling
<br>through Egyptian territory. "Egypt is circled by
<br>radicalism," he continued, expressing concern over
<br>instability in Sudan and Somalia as well. Egypt's own
<br>successful campaign against radicalism in the 1990s provided
<br>a useful lesson in how to counteract extremist groups by
<br>reducing their ability to operate and raise funds, in
<br>additional to educating people on the dangers of extremism.
<br>Soliman noted that only the Muslim Brotherhood remained and
<br>the Egyptian government continued to "make it difficult" for
<br>them to operate.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) "We do not want incidents like Gaza to inflame
<br>public anger," Soliman said, adding that the Gaza conflict
<br>put "moderate (Arab) regimes" in a corner. To prevent
<br>another outbreak of violence, Egypt is focusing on
<br>Palestinian reconciliation and a durable cease-fire between
<br>Hamas and Israel. On reconciliation, Soliman explained, the
<br>ultimate goal was to return the Palestinian Authority to
<br>Gaza, as "Gaza in the hands of radicals will never be calm."
<br>The problem, however, is that the PA cannot return to Gaza
<br>without Hamas' acquiescence. Soliman said the PA must return
<br>before the January 2010 Palestinian elections, or else Gazans
<br>would be afraid to vote for moderates.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Stability in Gaza also depends on giving people a
<br>more "normal" life, Soliman continued, saying Israel must be
<br>convinced to regularly open the border crossings for
<br>legitimate commercial activity. The current system - where
<br>Egypt informs Israel of a humanitarian shipment and Israel
<br>waits two days before accepting or rejecting the shipment for
<br>transfer to Gaza - does not adequately meet people's needs.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) On Palestinian reconciliation, Soliman said he
<br>expected the factions to return to Egypt on April 26 to
<br>discuss his proposal on establishing a high committee
<br>comprised of the various factions. The committee would be
<br>responsible for preparing for the January 2010 elections,
<br>monitoring reconstruction, and reforming the security
<br>services in Gaza. On reconstruction, the committee would
<br>issue licenses for companies eligible to participate on
<br>projects, but the PA would decide who receives the money for
<br>private and government contracts. Arab governments would
<br>assist with reforming the security services and could base
<br>security assistance out of Egypt. Soliman doubted that Hamas
<br>would agree to the high committee, but said it was important
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>to keep Hamas and Fatah talking, so they would not resort to
<br>violence.
<br>
<br>-----------------------
<br>Iran, Counter Smuggling
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Iran is "very active in Egypt," Soliman said.
<br>Iranian financial support to Hamas amounted to $25 million a
<br>month, but he said Egypt was "succeeding" in preventing
<br>financial support from entering Gaza through Egypt. Iran has
<br>tried several times to pay the salaries for the al-Qassam
<br>Battalions, but Egypt had succeeded in preventing the money
<br>from reaching Gaza. Soliman said the Egyptian government had
<br>arrested a "big Hezbollah cell," which was Hezbollah's first
<br>attempt to stand up a cell within Egypt. Iran was also
<br>trying to recruit support from the Sinai Bedouins, he
<br>claimed, in order to facilitate arms smuggling to Gaza. So
<br>far, he continued, Egypt had successfully stopped Hamas from
<br>rearming. Soliman noted that in six months, MOD will have
<br>completed the construction of a subterranean steel wall along
<br>the Egypt-Gaza border to prevent smuggling. He warned,
<br>however, that people will find an alternative to the tunnels
<br>to smuggle arms, goods, people, and money. Admiral Mullen
<br>expressed appreciation for Egypt's efforts to combat
<br>smuggling, adding that he hoped Egypt felt comfortable enough
<br>to ask for additional border security assistance at any time.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Egypt has "started a confrontation with Hezbollah
<br>and Iran," Soliman stressed, and "we will not allow Iran to
<br>operate in Egypt." Soliman said Egypt had sent a clear
<br>message to Iran that if they interfere in Egypt, Egypt will
<br>interfere in Iran, adding that EGIS had already begun
<br>recruiting agents in Iraq and Syria. Soliman hoped the U.S.
<br>would "not walk the same track as the Europeans" in regards
<br>to negotiating with Iran and warned against only focusing on
<br>one issue at time, like Iran's nuclear weapons program. Iran
<br>must "pay the price" for its actions and not be allowed to
<br>interfere in regional affairs. "If you want Egypt to
<br>cooperate with you on Iran, we will," Soliman added, "it
<br>would take a big burden off our shoulders."
<br>
<br>-----
<br>Sudan
<br>-----
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Egypt is very concerned with stability in Sudan,
<br>Soliman said, but asked for the U.S. to be "patient" with the
<br>Sudanese government and give Egypt time to help the Sudanese
<br>government deal with its problems. He applauded the
<br>appointment of Special Envoy Gration and recent U.S.
<br>statements on Sudan. Soliman said Egypt was focused on three
<br>areas for promoting stability in Sudan: 1) repairing the
<br>relationship between Chadean President Deby and Sudanese
<br>President Bashir and stopping their support for each others'
<br>insurgencies 2) supporting negotiations between the various
<br>factions in Darfur, and 3) implementing the CPA. Soliman
<br>encouraged a larger role for French President Sarkozy in
<br>mediating between Chad and Sudan. He said that Southern
<br>Sudan "feels no benefits from unity," and Egypt is trying to
<br>bridge the "physiological gap" between north and south itself
<br>by providing humanitarian assistance. "Egypt does not want a
<br>divided Sudan," he stressed. Admiral Mullen replied that
<br>Egypt's leadership on Sudan was critical and looked forward
<br>to increased cooperation between Egypt and Special Envoy
<br>Gration.
<br>
<br>------------------
<br>Piracy and Somalia
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Admiral Mullen stressed that piracy was an
<br>international crime that needed an international solution,
<br>especially on support for trying captured pirates. The U.S.
<br>did not want Somalia to become the next safe haven for
<br>al-Qaeda after Pakistan, he stressed. Soliman replied that
<br>there were not enough ships in the region to provide adequate
<br>security against pirate attacks and recommended that the
<br>international community, through the UN Security Council,
<br>focus counter piracy efforts on the Somali shore.
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) Admiral Mullen did not have the opportunity to clear
<br>before his departure.
