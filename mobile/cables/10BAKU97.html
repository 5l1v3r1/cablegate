<br>(b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Over the last ten days Baku Iran watcher has met with
<br>over a dozen Iranian contacts to obtain their insights and
<br>expectations on the upcoming 22 Bahman/February 11 opposition
<br>demonstrations in Iran. Contacts polled included Iranian
<br>bankers, wealthy businessmen, NGO figures, journalists,
<br>management consultants, and students. The polled group
<br>includes several professedly "apolitical" interlocutors and
<br>two opposition skeptics, as well as several opposition
<br>supporters and activists.
<br>
<br>Massive Tehran Protest Demonstrations Expected
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Most Baku Iran watcher contacts (including several
<br>Iran-based interviewees) predict massive demonstrations in
<br>Tehran, and significant protests in Tabriz, Mashad, Isfahan,
<br>and some smaller cities. Many asserted that
<br>pre-demonstration planning, propaganda, and organizational
<br>activities by opposition supporters (especially students) is
<br>far more noticeable and fractionalized compared to previous
<br>demonstrations. Several commentators claimed that while
<br>pro-Moussavi and pro-Karroubi websites are still important
<br>sources of information and encouragement, they are no longer
<br>the only or even main reference points for determined
<br>oppositionists. "Neither Moussavi nor Karroubi can stop this
<br>(opposition protests) now," one social activist contended.
<br>
<br>Opposition Turnout Efforts
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) A businessman pointed out that for the first time the
<br>reformist fraction in the Majlis, the reformist-affiliated
<br>Islamic Iran Participation Front, and similar groups have
<br>issued calls for large turnouts clearly aimed at protesters.
<br>Two student sources and a journalist related that small group
<br>of university students and others have traveled from Tehran
<br>to their hometowns to help promote broader protest turnouts
<br>and coordination. While a businessman from Isfahan claimed
<br>that opposition organizations are increasingly perceptible in
<br>his city, other interlocutors expressed skepticism that such
<br>activities will have a measurable impact in the short run. A
<br>Tehran University lecturer stressed that opposition
<br>organization and planning in urban areas is spreading. He
<br>conceded a lack of commensurate rural protest, but dismissed
<br>this as unimportant, since "radical change comes from cities,
<br>not villages." Rural populations were also not a factor in
<br>the overthrow of the Shah, he stated.
<br>
<br>
<br>Teams Put Up Posters, Graffiti
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) A Tehran student who has participated in all the
<br>post-presidential election protests claimed that a former
<br>drop-off in his friends willingness to participate in
<br>demonstrations was reversed in the Ashura protests, and is
<br>picking up steam. "Almost all of them will turnout on 22
<br>Bahman," he said. He said that he is part of a four-man
<br>group that regularly travels on two motorcycles looking for
<br>places to paint anti-regime graffiti or put up posters: "two
<br>of us act as lookouts, while the others draw the graffiti."
<br>He described this as a common model for young people putting
<br>up slogans. The student called himself a "pacifist,"
<br>favoring non-violent protest, but claimed that many people
<br>are talking about bringing clubs and knives with them "to
<br>defend against the Basij." A Mashad resident also expressed
<br>fear of 22 Bahman violence, but noted that popular
<br>anti-regime clerics there are promoting non-violence.
<br>
<br>Father Knows Best?
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The same student related that a few days before
<br>Ashura he and a friend were caught by police sending protest
<br>emails over the internet from a closed office. He said that
<br>he police said that they didn't want to arrest them, but
<br>"needed to eat." After receiving a bribe delivered by his
<br>sister, the police let them go, without any questions about
<br>my identity or where I live." The student added that after
<br>this incident his father complained that "I can't afford your
<br>revolution."
<br>
<br>Khameini "Not As Powerful As You Think"
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx who is friendly
<br>with Supreme Leader Khameini's family, xxxxxxxxxxxx told Iran watcher
<br>bluntly that Khameini is "not as powerful as you guys think."
<br>According to this source, Khameini is subject to severe
<br>bouts of depression, and takes morphine (not opium)
<br>regularly. He claimed that Khameini is "unable to function
<br>half the time," and relies totally on his advisors.
<br>Khameini's son Mojtaba he dismissed as "a complete idiot" who
<br>is easily manipulated and has no future after Khameini leaves
<br>the scene (see septel).
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Though stressing that he is not an opponent of the
<br>Islamic system, he warned that the Revolutionary Guard-based
<br>faction which "stole the election," and is now seeking total
<br>control is "extremely dangerous to both us and you." He
<br>repeatedly characterized this group as "a criminal cult,"
<br>motivated by its fanaticism, ignorance, and the monetary
<br>self-interest of its members. He added that the group is
<br>intent on exporting revolution. According to source, both
<br>Ahmedinejad and Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi are affiliates rather
<br>than "leaders" of this group, and neither will likely end up
<br>with significant power if the group successfully consolidates
<br>control over the state and its economy (see reftel).
<br>
<br>"Iran Can't Go On Like This"
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx placed the 22 Bahman protests within
<br>this context as part of an inner-regime coalition's effort to
<br>split Khameini from Ahmedinejad, and retake power from the
<br>"anti-democratic cult." (Note: other Iranian sources
<br>expressed doubt that protesters will accept maintenance of
<br>Khameini in office. "(Khameini) must go whatever Karroubi
<br>says, and whether or not he breaks with Ahmedinejad," a
<br>student asserted. End Note).
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed that extra-judicial murders
<br>undertaken by cult-related elements are being stepped up, and
<br>placed the recent bombing death of an Iranian physicist and
<br>the alleged killing of non-cult generals directly in this
<br>context. He claimed that Iran's economy is approaching a
<br>crisis, and predicted that Iran is likely on the road to
<br>greater violence and unrest. While not certain of the
<br>ultimate outcome, he opined that 22 Bahman may well move Iran
<br>closer to a political endgame. He explicitly rejected
<br>suggestions that Iran can continue indefinitely going through
<br>periods of mass protest followed by crackdowns. He stressed
<br>that events are moving forward - instability, fractionalism,
<br>and factionalism within the country are increasing, and "Iran
<br>simply cannot go on like this."
