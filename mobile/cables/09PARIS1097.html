<br>SUBJECT: IRAN: FRENCH COMMENTS ON DEALING WITH HOSTAGES 
<br>
<br>REF: PARIS 1046 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Kathleen H. Allegrone, for 
<br>reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: President Sarkozy's Strategic Affairs 
<br>Advisor Franois Richier and MFA Middle East Director (A/S 
<br>equivalent) Patrice Paoli told Political Minister Counselor 
<br>in separate meetings August 11 that the French approached 
<br>their hostage situations in Iran by first seeking an 
<br>immediate, behind-the-scenes resolution before the Iranians 
<br>brought charges against their captives, and then, once that 
<br>approach failed, by adopting a two-pronged strategy: (1) 
<br>relentlessly publicizing the cases with repeated employment 
<br>of key words chosen carefully to put the Iranians on the 
<br>defensive, and (2) constant exertion of diplomatic and 
<br>political pressure, with the help of allies, in the form of 
<br>regular demarches in Tehran and convocations of Iranian 
<br>Ambassadors in European and Middle Eastern capitals. Paoli 
<br>and Richier predicted that the Iranians will advise us, via 
<br>the Swiss, to remain calm and quiet while waiting for Iranian 
<br>legal procedures to move forward. Ignore this warning, they 
<br>insisted, because silence will not expedite the process. 
<br>They argued that USG statements and actions can sway and even 
<br>mobilize public opinion within Iran. Whether or not we 
<br>choose to speak out, they warned, the Iranians will 
<br>energetically disseminate fabricated accusations. As the USG 
<br>seeks to engage the Iranians, Richier predicted it will be 
<br>difficult to determine which Iranian institution currently 
<br>has control of American hostages and, more importantly, which 
<br>one has the authority to decide their fate. The French still 
<br>have not identified a key broker within the Iranian 
<br>government with the power to resolve their own hostage cases. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) SUMMARY (CONT'D): Paoli and Richier also warned of 
<br>possible Iranian efforts to blackmail the USG. They may try, 
<br>for instance, to drag out the cases of the American and 
<br>French hostages through the US/EU late September deadline for 
<br>a response from the regime on the nuclear issue. Richier 
<br>said the French believe this familiar Iranian tactic -- 
<br>hostage-taking as political blackmail -- will only increase 
<br>in the near future. The Iranians may also seek specific 
<br>exchanges, such as the release from French custody of Majid 
<br>Kakavand, an Iranian national whom the French arrested March 
<br>20 at Charles de Gaulle airport on the behalf of the U.S. 
<br>Department of Justice on proliferation issues. Overall, as 
<br>the USG prepares to handle its hostage cases, the French 
<br>recommended we prepare for uncertainty. In the face of 
<br>unpredictable Iranian behavior, Paoli and Richier said that 
<br>constant pressure from foreign leaders and the media appears 
<br>to be the only means to accelerate decision-making in Tehran. 
<br>They also reported that the EU has no plans at the moment to 
<br>recall its Ambassadors from Iran. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>STEP 1: SEEK BEHIND-THE-SCENES RESOLUTION 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Franois Richier and Patrice Paoli told the Political 
<br>Minister Counselor that each time they learned of the arrest 
<br>of their citizens in Iran, the GOF sought their immediate 
<br>release through discrete but direct contact with Iranian 
<br>officials. (NOTE: Richier was accompanied by Mr. Lioutaud 
<br>from the Office of French National Intelligence Coordinator, 
<br>Bernard Bajolet (equivalent to our Director of National 
<br>Intelligence). END NOTE.) They hoped to act quickly enough 
<br>to prevent the regime from pressing formal charges. Once the 
<br>Iranians refused to release the prisoners, Paoli said, the 
<br>prosecutors publicized the charges and began preparations for 
<br>a public trial. A trial seems to be a pre-condition for the 
<br>release of foreign detainees in Iran, whom the French 
<br>described as "hostages" held in order to achieve political 
<br>goals. 
<br>
<br>STEP 2: USE THE MEDIA TO PUT IRANIANS ON DEFENSIVE 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Once the quiet approach failed, the French launched a 
<br>relentless public relations strategy. They did not merely 
<br>wait for questions from the press; instead, they made 
<br>frequent pronouncements of their own about the hostages. 
<br>They publicized the cases with repeated use of key words 
<br>chosen carefully to put the regime on the defensive by 
<br>influencing Iranian public opinion. Paoli and Richier 
<br>emphasized the susceptibility of the Iranian population to 
<br>messages sent through the media. USG public statements can 
<br>sway and even mobilize public opinion within Iran, they 
<br>claimed, especially in the post-election environment. 
<br>¶5. (S) In their statements, the French repeatedly employed 
<br>key words to focus attention on the rights of detainees, and 
<br>on Iranian legal commitments to respect those rights, such as 
<br>"basic human rights," "good treatment," "Vienna Convention." 
<br>They also used words to refute the regime's false 
<br>accusations, like "innocent," "baseless," and "immediate 
<br>release." Paoli said the French have deliberately avoided 
<br>using the word "negotiation" when describing their contact 
<br>with Iranian leaders: "We demand only their immediate 
<br>liberation; we do not negotiate for the release of innocent 
<br>civilians." (NOTE: Paoli said he strongly regretted the 
<br>mistaken use of the word "negotiate" recently by a GOF 
<br>spokesman. END NOTE.) 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Moreover, the French predicted that the Iranians will 
<br>advise us, via the Swiss, to remain calm and quiet. They 
<br>will imply that the cases will be resolved more quickly if we 
<br>just wait for the Iranian legal procedures to move forward. 
<br>Ignore this warning, Richier and Paoli insisted. "Be vocal," 
<br>Richier advised, "even more so if the Iranians ask you not to 
<br>be," because silence will not expedite the process. "They 
<br>are the masters of stalling tactics," Paoli said. Whether or 
<br>not we choose to remain silent about the cases, the Iranians 
<br>will launch a media blitz. They will energetically 
<br>disseminate fabricated accusations about their captives, 
<br>Richier predicted. Paoli and Richier both acknowledged that 
<br>an aggressive USG public posture involves risks as well, as 
<br>it will "increase the value" of the hostages to Iranian 
<br>leaders. Nonetheless, they said they still believe that 
<br>public pressure, on balance, will prove more effective than 
<br>behind-the-scenes engagement. Ideally, both public 
<br>statements and private discussions can take place 
<br>simultaneously. 
<br>
<br>STEP 3: CALL ON ALLIES (AND OTHERS) TO PRESSURE IRAN 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Paoli and Richier advocated the constant exertion of 
<br>diplomatic and political pressure on the Iranian regime. 
<br>Recognizing the central role of the wiss protecting power, 
<br>they suggested the USG enlist the help of other allies as 
<br>well, in the form of regular demarches in Tehran and 
<br>convocations of Iranian leaders in capitals around the world. 
<br>Paoli explicitly stated that France would be willing to 
<br>weigh in, if asked. Richier explained that the French 
<br>approached Syria almost immediately after they learned French 
<br>citizien Clotilde Reiss had been arrested on July 1. He then 
<br>previewed the presidential communiqu about the release of 
<br>the French Embassy employee, Nazak Afshar, in which the 
<br>French explicitly thanked the Syrians for their help. "Of 
<br>course we don't know if the Syrians did anything," Richier 
<br>admitted, "but we wanted to thank them anyway. It should at 
<br>least confuse the Iranians." He said the French did not/not 
<br>reach out to Russia and China for assistance, but he and 
<br>Paoli both argued that the support of EU and other countries 
<br>had a major impact on Iranian leaders. The French have 
<br>coordinated closely with the British, Richier said, though 
<br>primarily on the ground in Tehran. He suggested the USG 
<br>consider approaching other countries, including relatively 
<br>disinterested allies such as Brazil, and ask them to lean on 
<br>the Iranians. He also mentioned the potential impact of 
<br>blogs written by Iranian ex-patriates in the U.S. 
<br>
<br>GOOD LUCK FIGURING OUT WHO IS IN CHARGE IN TEHRAN 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Richier predicted it will be difficult to determine 
<br>which Iranian institution currently has control of the U.S. 
<br>hostages and, more importantly, which one has the authority 
<br>to decide their fate. The French still have not identified a 
<br>key broker within the Iranian government with the power to 
<br>resolve their own hostage cases. They learned that the 
<br>deliberative procedures of Iranian institutions remain 
<br>unusually opaque. 
<br>
<br>BE PREPARED FOR POLITICAL BLACKMAIL 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Richier said the Iranians have in the past tried to 
<br>"blackmail" them, trading release of a French national for an 
<br>Iranian national. He warned of possible Iranian efforts to 
<br>blackmail the USG. The Iranians may try, for instance, to 
<br>drag out the cases of the American and French hostages 
<br>through the US/EU late September deadline for a response from 
<br>the regime on the nuclear issue. Richier said the French 
<br>believe this familiar Iranian tactic -- hostage-taking as 
<br>political blackmail -- will only increase in the near future. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) The Iranians may also seek specific exchanges, such 
<br>as the release from French custody of Majid Kakavand. 
<br>Without going into details, Richier said Kakavand had been 
<br>apprehended by the French and was under a U.S. extradition 
<br>request. He noted that GOF officials had briefed President 
<br>Sarkozy on this case and that the French are prepared to 
<br>continue holding him. (Background from Embassy Justice 
<br>Attache: Kakavand is an Iranian national whom the French 
<br>arrested March 20 at Charles de Gaulle airport on behalf of 
<br>the Department of Justice for extradition to the U.S. on 
<br>export control (proliferation) charges.) Then again, Richier 
<br>noted, it is possible that the Iranian agency or agencies 
<br>holding American citizens may not be aware of Kakavand, or 
<br>may have no interest in his release; it is simply impossible 
<br>to predict how their bureaucracies will behave. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) Paoli said the French knew the Iranians intended to 
<br>use the arrest of Clotilde Reiss and Nazak Afshar as a means 
<br>to punish the French for their criticism of Iran's recent 
<br>election results. More importantly, the Iranians hoped to 
<br>muzzle future French criticism: "They want to paralyze us," 
<br>Paoli said, explaining that the Iranians had failed in this 
<br>attempt. Of course, he added, the regime also wanted to use 
<br>French and British hostages to validate their allegation that 
<br>foreign agents organized the mass post-election protests. 
<br>Paoli and Richier both reported that the Iranians continue to 
<br>harass and intimidate the local employees of their Embassy in 
<br>Tehran. They described the burden on resources required to 
<br>respond to each arrest: "The time we have had to devote to 
<br>this is absolutely ridiculous," Richier said. 
<br>
<br>ADAPT YOUR APPROACH FOR EACH HOSTAGE 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Before offering accounts of the French experience 
<br>with hostages in Iran, Richier and Paoli were both at pains 
<br>to avoid offering any absolute advice. They noted 
<br>significant differences in the cases of Stephane Lherbier, 
<br>Reiss, Afshar, the Americans captured near the border with 
<br>Kurdistan, and other U.S.-Iranian dual nationals currently in 
<br>custody. Paoli said the French made a concerted, and 
<br>successful, effort to keep the case of Stephane Lherbier 
<br>"apolitical." (NOTE: Lherbier, a French fisherman arrested 
<br>by the Iranians in 2006, spent almost a year in prison prior 
<br>to his release in 2007. END NOTE.) Since the Iranians have 
<br>already accused the French and British hostages of espionage, 
<br>Paoli and Richier suggested the USG make strenuous efforts to 
<br>distance those cases from the situation of the U.S. hikers 
<br>currently in captivity. Moreover, in 2007, Iranian leaders 
<br>did not perceive the French as negatively as they do now, 
<br>which they said has further complicated the recent hostage 
<br>cases. Richier and Paoli both warned that the USG must make 
<br>every effort to dissuade the Iranians from politicizing the 
<br>case of the American hikers; thus far, they noted, Iranian 
<br>officials have not formally linked them to the case against 
<br>opposition members and the British and French hostages. 
<br>Richier reported that the French found the Iranian "system" 
<br>to be "perverse and complex but stable" in 2006, when seeking 
<br>the release of Lherbier. "Now it is still perverse and 
<br>complex," Richier said, "but unstable, and this makes 
<br>everything more difficult." 
<br>
<br>BRACE FOR UNCERTAINTY 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) Paoli stressed in particular the uncertain and 
<br>unpredictable nature of French dealings with Iran in hostage 
<br>situations. There are no procedural certainties, and the 
<br>timing of various steps appears arbitrary. Progress toward a 
<br>trial could take months, depending on variables such as the 
<br>political environment and the whims of key actors inside 
<br>Iranian institutions. "Anything is possible and we know next 
<br>to nothing," Paoli said, citing the recent arrest and quick 
<br>release of a French citizen who told Iranian provincial 
<br>police he was a researcher following the paths of the 
<br>dinosaurs. In the face of this uncertainty, Paoli and 
<br>Richier said that constant pressure from foreign leaders and 
<br>the media appears to be the only means to accelerate 
<br>decision-making in Iran. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) Paoli and Richier described their continuing 
<br>uncertainty about the case of Clotilde Reiss. They both 
<br>stopped short of confirming that she would soon be 
<br>transferred from Evin prison to the French Embassy in Tehran, 
<br>although they expressed strong optimism. Richier added that 
<br>this step will require the GOF to pay the Iranians a large 
<br>sum, to ensure that Reiss stays in the country pending 
<br>further legal action against her (reftel). Richier would not 
<br>say whether the French will permit the Iranians to take Reiss 
<br>back to court, or to prison: "We're focused on our short-term 
<br>objective right now -- getting her out of jail." He said 
<br>that the French worry the Iranians could decide to arrest in 
<br>the near future another one of the approximately 1,800 French 
<br>citizens living in Iran. 
<br>
<br>EU HAS NO PLANS TO RECALL AMBASSADORS 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶15. (S) Paoli noted that the EU relations with Iran are 
<br>extremely tense at the moment. He said the Iranians 
<br>currently refuse to receive the Swedish Ambassador, even in 
<br>his capacity as representative of the EU Presidency. 
<br>Nonetheless, barring extreme actions by the Iranians, such as 
<br>expulsion of one of the EU Ambassadors, Paoli predicted that 
<br>the EU will not/not decide to withdraw its Ambassadors from 
<br>Tehran. (NOTE: Deputy MFA Middle East Director (PDAS 
<br>equivalent) Jean-Franois Paucelle provided background on 
<br>this issue in an earlier meeting. He served as French Charge 
<br>d'Affairs in Tehran in 1997, after the EU withdrew its 
<br>Ambassadors to protest the assassination in Berlin, by 
<br>Iranian government agents, of four members of the Iranian 
<br>opposition-in-exile. European Embassies, after their 
<br>Ambassadors had departed, soon learned that Iranian officials 
<br>refused to receive European Charges d'Affaires, and so all 
<br>communication between EU members and Iran slowed down or 
<br>halted altogether. The Europeans also realized that the 
<br>politics of returning Ambassadors to Iran can become complex. 
<br>Following the withdrawal of their Ambassadors at present, 
<br>Paucelle said, the Europeans would need to determine ahead of 
<br>time when and under what conditions they would return. 
<br>Possible criteria range widely, from returning the 
<br>Ambassadors after the regime changes, as a long-term 
<br>deadline, to after the release of Clotilde Reiss, as the 
<br>shortest possible window. In addition, after the EU decided 
<br>to return its Ambassadors in 1997, the Iranians refused to 
<br>allow some of them to return, in an attempt to sow division 
<br>among EU members. This chastening experience, Paucelle said, 
<br>continues to inform EU discussions about whether or not to 
<br>recall their Ambassadors from Iran. END NOTE.)

<br>hostage issues and update Washington offices as events unfold.
