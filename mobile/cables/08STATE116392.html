<br> 
<br>REF: A. 08 STATE 001379 
<br>     ¶B. 08 STATE 64936 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: CATHERINE BROWN, DAS, INR/IPC. REASON: 1.4(C). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) SUMMARY:  This cable provides the full text of the 
<br>new National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) on 
<br>Palestinian Issues (paragraph 3-end) and encourages 
<br>Department personnel at post to assist in compiling 
<br>Palestinian biographic information (paragraph 2). 
<br> 
<br>¶A. (S/NF) The NHCD results from a recent Washington review of 
<br>reporting and collection needs for Palestinian Issues and 
<br>sets forth a list of priorities intended to guide 
<br>participating USG agencies as they allocate resources and 
<br>update plans to collect information on Palestinian Issues. 
<br>The priorities may also help the Embassy manage reporting and 
<br>collection, including formulation of Mission Strategic Plans 
<br>(MSPs). 
<br> 
<br>¶B. (S/NF) This NHCD is compliant with the National 
<br>Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), which was 
<br>established in response to NSPD-26 of February 24, 2003.  If 
<br>needed, GRPO can provide further background on the NIPF and 
<br>the use of NIPF abbreviations (shown in parentheses following 
<br>each sub-issue below) in NHCDs. 
<br> 
<br>¶C. (S/NF) Important information responsive to the NHCD often 
<br>is available to non-State members of the Country Team whose 
<br>agencies participated in the review leading to the NHCD's 
<br>issuance.  COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can 
<br>assist by coordinating with other Country Team members to 
<br>encourage relevant reporting through their own or State 
<br>Department channels. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting - including on 
<br>Palestinians: 
<br> 
<br>¶A.  (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State 
<br>reporting officers for much of the biographical information 
<br>collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting via email 
<br>and other means is vital to the community's collection 
<br>efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for 
<br>dissemination to the IC.  State reporting officers are 
<br>encouraged to report on noteworthy Palestinians as 
<br>information becomes available. 
<br> 
<br>¶B.  (S/NF) When it is available, reporting officers should 
<br>include as much of the following information as possible: 
<br>office and organizational titles; names, position titles and 
<br>other information on business cards; numbers of telephones, 
<br>cell phones, pagers and faxes; compendia of contact 
<br>information, such as telephone directories (in compact disc 
<br>or electronic format if available) and e-mail listings; 
<br>internet and intranet "handles", internet e-mail addresses, 
<br>web site identification-URLs; credit card account numbers; 
<br>frequent flyer account numbers; work schedules, and other 
<br>relevant biographical information.
