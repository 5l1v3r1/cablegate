<br>SUBJECT: OMANI GOVERNMENT REACTS STRONGLY TO SUGGESTION OF PATRIOT 
<br>OFFER 
<br> 
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Richard Schmierer, Ambassador, Department of State, 
<br>Embassy Muscat; REASON: 1.4(A), (B), (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  A recent New York Time's (NYT) article describing 
<br>Patriot missile deployment to countries in the Gulf in order to 
<br>counter Iran, assuage Israel, and reassure our Gulf partners has 
<br>been disquieting to the Omani Government.  There has never been an 
<br>official USG offer of Patriots to Oman, due in large part to the 
<br>GoO's rejection of any undertaking that might include or would 
<br>imply the presence of Patriot missiles here.  Oman's close 
<br>partnership with the USG, particularly through the Base Access 
<br>Agreement (BAA), is contingent on maintaining an extremely low 
<br>profile and continuing the Sultanate's foreign policy objective of 
<br>carefully balancing public perception of its relationships with the 
<br>U.S. and Iran.  Press of this sort, however unintended, makes it 
<br>extremely difficult for Oman to maintain that balance.  End 
<br>Summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Press Articles on Missile Defense in the Gulf 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (U) A NYT article appeared on January 30 titled "U.S. Speeding 
<br>Up Missile Defenses in Persian Gulf," which quoted General Petraeus 
<br>as saying that Patriot missile batteries would be located in four 
<br>gulf countries, and noted that Saudi Arabia already has Patriots. 
<br>An unnamed military official named the countries as Qatar, the UAE, 
<br>Bahrain and Kuwait.   The version of this article syndicated by the 
<br>NYT news service includes the sentence "Oman, which has always been 
<br>sensitive about perceptions that it is doing U.S. bidding, has also 
<br>been approached, but there is no deployment of Patriots there, 
<br>according to U.S. officials."  (Note:  That sentence does not/not 
<br>appear in the version currently available via the NYT website, and 
<br>it is unclear to post if it appeared in the print edition on 
<br>January 31; the syndicated version of the article is otherwise not 
<br>substantially different from the NYT original.  End Note).   The 
<br>item was picked up by regional press on January 31, quoting the NYT 
<br>article and specifically noting that "Oman has declined the offer." 
<br>On February 2, the private English daily "Times of Oman" carried a 
<br>front page article titled "Missile Shield: Oman denies receiving 
<br>any offer from US."  In it, Sayyid Badr al Busaidi, Secretary 
<br>General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), is quoted as 
<br>saying, "the Sultanate's position on such matters is firm and that 
<br>it does not ... enter into alliances or axis (sic) against any 
<br>state."  He stressed that Oman "does not allow its territory to be 
<br>used to carry out any military operations against any country in 
<br>the region." 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Oman is not Interested 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) The Embassy has no record of a formal offer of Patriot 
<br>missiles made to Oman by the USG.  However, a number of discussions 
<br>have occurred in which USG intent was to gauge Omani interest in 
<br>collective missile defense capability.  Oman has consistently shown 
<br>a lack of interest and has politely declined to engage in 
<br>substantive discussions on "shared early warning" systems, 
<br>"integrated air defense,"  or "collective defense."  (Note:  This 
<br>is likely due to its assessment that Iran does not pose an imminent 
<br>threat, its desire to not needlessly antagonize Iran, and its 
<br>distrust of fellow GCC members, making it unwilling to share data 
<br>within that group.  End Note.)  Further, in official 
<br>correspondence, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) rejected an offer for 
<br>a "Missile and Air Defence Working Group" on February 6, 2009; 
<br>rejected further offers for an "Air and Missile Defense Shared 
<br>Early Warning (SEW) System" on March 30, 2009, citing Oman's 
<br>"unwillingness to commit itself to a SEW"; and on July 22, 2009 
<br>again rejected any participation in the "Air Defense Missiles 
<br>Advanced Warning System" project. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Direct Omani Reaction 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) The Omani Royal Office made contact with the Embassy on 
<br>February 2 to express strong concern about the article and its 
<br>repercussions, as that office had just received a pointed inquiry 
<br>from the Sultan on this matter.  In a follow-up discussion embassy 
<br>officer provided the history of discussions on the issue, of which 
<br>the Royal Office was previously unaware, due to what was described 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>as a "lack of lateral coordination within the GoO." 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Comment:  The strength of Oman's immediate reaction, and the 
<br>level at which it transpired, is reflective of the tremendous 
<br>seriousness with which this matter is viewed by the GoO.  It is 
<br>likely that one of the goals of Badr's media statement was to 
<br>protect the U.S./Omani relationship, as any belief that the U.S. 
<br>would attempt to utilize Omani territory in this way could 
<br>potentially cause a public backlash that would jeopardize other 
<br>aspects of our relationship.  The deployment of Patriots to Oman, 
<br>especially with the goal of countering the Iran threat, would run 
<br>completely counter to Oman's publicly-stated foreign-policy 
<br>objectives.  Although they do not find the threat imminent, Iran is 
<br>Oman's number one strategic threat; however, the GoO fundamentally 
<br>believes the threat can be mitigated through careful management of 
<br>the relationship.  Therefore, the GoO works very deliberately to 
<br>create a  public perception of balance in its relationships with 
<br>the U.S. and Iran.  Oman's security strategy of keeping a low 
<br>public profile in general has been threatened by the attention 
<br>brought by the NYT article, and the GoO is working to manage the 
<br>message for the public.  End Comment.
