<br>SUBJECT: THE PNG'ING OF SUHA ARAFAT: MANY RUMORS, FEW FACTS
<br>
<br>REF: A. IIR 6 897 0136 07 (NOTALS)
<br>¶B. 06 TUNIS 2570
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Robert F. Godec for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) Summary: The GOT's decision last summer to revoke
<br>Suha Arafat's Tunisian citizenship, which had only been
<br>granted less than a year earlier, made international
<br>headlines. Since the appearance of the official register
<br>notice on August 7, the chattering class in Tunisia has not
<br>ceased to speculate about the reasons behind the decision.
<br>In a mid-October telcon with Ambassador Godec, Mrs. Arafat
<br>attributed her ouster to the personal animus of First Lady
<br>Leila Ben Ali, following a dispute over the forced closure of
<br>the Bouebdelli School, a well-respected private school. Had
<br>it remained open, the Bouebdelli School would have
<br>represented serious competition to the new Carthage
<br>International School, a joint venture between the two First
<br>Ladies. It is doubtful that we will ever know all of the
<br>facts in this affair, but the stories of corruption swirling
<br>around the Carthage International School have a ring of truth
<br>to them. Meanwhile, Mrs. Arafat was not shy in sharing with
<br>the Ambassador stinging criticism of President Ben Ali, the
<br>First Lady, and the web of corruption that she says surrounds
<br>them. End Summary.
<br>
<br>------------------
<br>Easy Come, Easy Go
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On August 7, the GOT's Official Journal contained a
<br>one-sentence announcement of decree number 2007-1976 of
<br>August 2, 2007, revoking the citizenship of Suha Arafat, wife
<br>of the late Palestinian Authority President Yassir Arafat.
<br>As reported Ref B, the GOT had only granted Tunisian
<br>nationality, by naturalization, to Mrs. Arafat and her 12
<br>year-old daughter Zahwa in September, 2006. (Note: The GOT
<br>did not revoke the citizenship of Mrs. Arafat's daughter.
<br>End Note.) The GOT's decision to revoke the citizenship of
<br>Mrs. Arafat came without warning. In an early July telcon
<br>with the Ambassador, Mrs. Arafat gave no indication that
<br>anything was amiss. Indeed, she indicated that she would
<br>like to meet with the Ambassador when she returned from her
<br>vacation in Malta later in the summer. Nor were there any
<br>distress signals in Ref A conversation with Mrs. Arafat,
<br>which also took place in early summer.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) In a mid-October telcon with the Ambassador, Ms.
<br>Arafat blamed her ouster on the personal animus of First Lady
<br>Leila Ben Ali. "I can't believe what she's has done to me,"
<br>Arafat exclaimed, "I've lost everything!" She charged that
<br>all of her properties in Tunisia had been confiscated, even
<br>by falsifying documents transferring ownership. (Note: It
<br>is rumored that Mrs. Arafat had invested -- and lost -- some
<br>2.5 million euros in the Carthage International School. End
<br>Note.) In addition, she said, her friends and colleagues in
<br>Tunisia, including her banker, had also come under pressure.
<br>"Anyone who supports me is punished."
<br>
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>But, Why?: The School Theory, Version I
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) Mrs. Arafat attributed her ouster to her falling
<br>out with First Lady Leila Ben Ali over the Carthage
<br>International School, a new, private, for-profit school, of
<br>which they had been co-owners. According to Mrs. Arafat's
<br>version of events, the dispute stemmed from Leila Ben Ali's
<br>decision to force the closure of the Bouebdelli school (also
<br>known as by the name of its parent group, Le Fondation Louis
<br>Pasteur), a highly respected private school, from which many
<br>of Tunisia's elite have graduated. (Note: The Bouebdelli
<br>school was notified in mid-May that the Minister of Education
<br>had ordered it to close, ostensibly for failure to comply
<br>with registration regulations. Public outcry ensued, fueled
<br>in part by a petition and letter-writing campaign organized
<br>by parents of Bouebdelli schoolchildren. Many local and
<br>international media reports criticized the decision to close
<br>the school as a flagrant attempt to stifle potential
<br>competition of the International School of Carthage. The
<br>fact that parents of Bouebdelli schoolchildren were
<br>encouraged to enroll their children at the Carthage school
<br>only served to fuel these charges, as did the August 29
<br>Presidential decree in which President Ben Ali granted
<br>1,794,600 Tunisian Dinars (approximately US $ 1.5 million) to
<br>the Carthage School, an estimated 25 percent of its operating
<br>budget.)
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) Mrs. Arafat asserted that Leila Ben Ali had
<br>
<br>TUNIS 00001489 002 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>overreached in the decision to force the Bouebdelli School to
<br>close. She claimed that she had tried to convince the
<br>Tunisian First Lady that "what we are doing is unethical,"
<br>and that competition ultimately would be healthy for the new
<br>school. Their arguments over this issue continued to
<br>escalate, according to Mrs. Arafat, culminating in the
<br>decision to revoke her citizenship while she was on vacation
<br>in Malta. Mrs. Arafat told the Ambassador that she intends
<br>to remain in Malta, where her brother serves as Palestinian
<br>Ambassador, but that she hopes to spend Christmas in the
<br>Palestinian Territories.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>But Why?: Version II of the School Theory
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) Other rumors have circulated with a different spin
<br>on the school story. According to this theory, it was Mrs.
<br>Arafat who overreached, not Leila Ben Ali. Specifically, it
<br>is said that Mrs. Arafat convinced the Ministry of Education
<br>to force the closure of the Bouebdelli School. She
<br>reportedly did so by invoking the name of Mrs. Ben Ali.
<br>Critically, though, according to this theory, Leila Ben Ali
<br>was not aware that her name was being invoked. Thus, the
<br>Tunisian First Lady was incensed when she learned about the
<br>school's closure -- and her alleged role in that decision --
<br>in the highly critical pieces in the local and international
<br>media. (Comment: The fact that the Bouebdelli School did
<br>not reopen, even after the revocation of Suha Arafat's
<br>citizenship, would seem to cast doubt on the accuracy of this
<br>theory. End Comment.)
<br>
<br>------------------------------------
<br>But Why?: An Array of Other Theories
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C/NF) Plenty of other theories have stoked the rumor mill
<br>in the Suha Arafat affair. One well-connected Palestinian
<br>resident in Tunisia told EmbOff that what sealed Mrs.
<br>Arafat's fate was that on a recent visit to Tripoli, she had
<br>asked Libyan Leader Qaddafi for money. Qaddafi had readily
<br>provided a hand-out, but he reportedly subsequently called
<br>President Ben Ali to chastise him for failing to provide
<br>adequately for the widow of the late Palestinian President.
<br>Ben Ali's acute embarrassment, so the story goes, quickly
<br>turned to wrath. It was not long before Mrs. Arafat's
<br>citizenship was revoked. Another theory holds that Suha
<br>Arafat was ousted because she had absconded with a
<br>significant amount of the first family's assets. Finally, in
<br>the face of persistent rumors that Mrs. Arafat had secretly
<br>married Belhassen Trabelsi, brother of the Tunisian First
<br>Lady, some commentators chalked up the whole ordeal to the
<br>failure of that relationship.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>Scathing Commentary on the First Family
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C/NF) No doubt as a result of her tribulations, Mrs.
<br>Arafat was not shy about sharing with the Ambassador her
<br>negative impressions of President Ben Ali, his wife, and her
<br>family members, whom, she said, collectively represent a web
<br>of corruption. Drawing on her close contact with the first
<br>family over the past several years, she made several
<br>allegations, among them the following:
<br>
<br>-- President Ben Ali remains weakened by his battle with
<br>cancer (NFI);
<br>
<br>-- President Ben Ali spends all his time playing with his son
<br>and following him around the residence;
<br>
<br>-- President Ben Ali simply does what his wife asks him to do;
<br>
<br>-- Leila Ben Ali and her family are stealing everything of
<br>value in the country;
<br>
<br>-- Leila Ben Ali believes that she will succeed her husband
<br>as President of Tunisia;
<br>
<br>-- The members of Ben Ali's extended family can do whatever
<br>they want with impunity, including the falsification of
<br>documents;
<br>
<br>-- Leila Ben Ali dropped the American curriculum that had
<br>been planned for the Carthage school because she
<br>fundamentally wants nothing to do with Americans.

<br>
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C/NF) It is doubtful that we will ever know all of the
<br>facts in the Suha Arafat affair, or, for that matter in the
<br>Bouebdelli School/Carthage International School matter.
<br>Clearly, having been stripped of her Tunisian citizenship and
<br>deprived of her properties here, Suha Arafat has an ax to
<br>grind with the Ben Ali clan, so her allegations must be taken
<br>with a big grain of salt. Although difficult to prove, there
<br>is a certain ring of truth to the stories of corruption
<br>swirling around the school issue. While it is not clear who
<br>was behind the Bouebdelli closure, the ready-made pool of
<br>students for whom Bouebdelli was no longer an option was
<br>certainly convenient for filling the classrooms in the
<br>Carthage School's opening year. Indeed, during a
<br>mid-September visit to the Carthage School, MgmtCouns learned
<br>that the school is filled to capacity. Beyond that, no
<br>school in recent memory has been constructed so quickly, had
<br>municipally provided access roads, street signs, and traffic
<br>lights installed so efficiently, or had such ease in getting
<br>certified (although it has not yet received the French
<br>accreditation the Bouebdelli School had). Nor is it common
<br>practice for the GOT to so generously subsidize a for-profit
<br>educational institution. Finally, it must be noted that the
<br>school affair, while rather blatant, is not an isolated case
<br>of favoritism and corruption. We will continue to follow
<br>this issue and report septel on other corruption charges.
<br>End Comment.
