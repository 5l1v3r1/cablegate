<br>Classified By: Ambassador Ivo Daalder.  Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) This is an action request.  See paragraph 10.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) SUMMARY: Leaders in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania
<br>are pressing hard for NATO Article 5 contingency planning for
<br>the Baltic states.  President Obama and Secretary Clinton are
<br>on record supporting such contingency planning for Allies.
<br>At the same time, however, NATO internal processes and
<br>politics make it difficult to openly carry out such planning,
<br>particularly if it would require specifying Russia as a
<br>potential threat.  Nevertheless, there are possible ways to
<br>meet the substance of Baltic demands.  The existing
<br>contingency plan for Poland, for example, might be modified
<br>to include the Baltics or generic plans for the use of the
<br>NATO Response Force could be exercised and certified in a
<br>manner consistent with Baltic defense.  We request high-level
<br>interagency discussion of the issue to develop the substance
<br>and NATO tactics of Baltic planning and exercises.  END
<br>SUMMARY
<br>
<br>Why Baltic Contingency Planning?
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) As reported in refs A-D, leaders in Estonia,
<br>Latvia, and Lithuania are pressing hard for NATO Article 5
<br>contingency planning for the defense of the Baltics.  The
<br>Administration at the highest levels is on record supporting
<br>such efforts.  President Obama told NATO Secretary General
<br>Rasmussen this during the latter's September 28-29 trip to
<br>Washington.  Furthermore, Secretary Clinton told her
<br>colleagues at the September 22 "Trans-Atlantic Dinner" in New
<br>York that the U.S. wants more work on Article 5 contingency
<br>plans (ref E).
<br>
<br>The Difficulties
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) At the same time, the internal processes and
<br>politics of the Alliance make it unlikely that a Baltic-only
<br>Article 5 contingency plan could be developed.  NATO
<br>contingency plans are designed for possible future security
<br>risks that are consistent with NATO's General Intelligence
<br>Estimate (MC 161) and NATO Ministerial Guidance.  While
<br>Admiral Stavridis, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe
<br>(SACEUR), does have the authority to generate, review and
<br>revise contingency plans based on changes in the strategic
<br>security environment, those changes to the security
<br>environment would need to be reflected in MC 161.  Without a
<br>change to MC 161, SACEUR does not have the authority to
<br>develop new Article 5 contingency plans.  Moreover, changes
<br>to MC 161 are not made by SACEUR.  They must be agreed by the
<br>NAC.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) In this case, the Baltic states clearly believe
<br>that the Russian Federation represents a future security risk
<br>and desire a contingency plan to address that risk.  And
<br>therein lies the problem.  While the exact content of MC 161
<br>cannot be discussed in this message, post-Cold War NATO has
<br>consistently said that it no longer views Russia as a threat.
<br>Allies, for example, agreed to language in the 1997
<br>NATO-Russia Founding Act that "NATO and Russia do not
<br>consider each other as adversaries."  As we saw during the
<br>debates over the Russia-Georgia war, many Allies will take
<br>great pains to avoid even the suggestion that the Alliance
<br>and Russia are on course toward a new Cold War.  Countries
<br>such as Germany are unlikely to agree changes to MC 161 that
<br>explicitly define Russia as a potential threat, preferring
<br>instead to argue that the Alliance needs to find a way to
<br>work cooperatively with Moscow.

<br>
<br>But Hard is Not "Too Hard"
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Despite these difficulties, however, there are
<br>steps that can be taken to meet the substance of the Baltic
<br>demands and demonstrate the Allied commitment to their
<br>defense.  As a start, SACEUR did begin conducting informal
<br>"prudent planning" efforts within his own Headquarters in the
<br>wake of the Russian-Georgian war.  These efforts should
<br>continue.  Furthermore, the existing NATO contingency plan
<br>for Poland is up for revision.  We could explore the
<br>possibility of revising this plan to include the
<br>reinforcement/defense of the Baltics as an element of the
<br>reinforcement/defense of Poland.  Indeed, this idea was first
<br>raised by the German PermRep in conversation with Ambassador
<br>Daalder.  NATO also has a number of agreed generic
<br>contingency plans for the NATO Response Force (NRF),
<br>including for relatively high-end "initial entry operations."
<br>Perhaps these generic NRF plans can be exercised/certified
<br>in a manner that would be consistent with the defense of the
<br>Baltics.  Finally, we could pursue a generic Article 5
<br>Alliance-wide contingency plan which would be applicable to
<br>multiple threats.
<br>
<br>Necessary for NATO-Russia; Expeditionary Forces
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Baltic reassurance can not be seen in isolation.
<br>Our ability to move forward with other U.S. priorities at
<br>NATO will be affected by our ability to reassure the Baltic
<br>states.  For example, our ability to maintain an Allied
<br>consensus on re-engagement with Moscow will depend on it.
<br>Furthermore, the Baltic states have made clear that if they
<br>do not feel they can trust Allies to defend them, they will
<br>have to consider developing a force structure focused on
<br>territorial defense rather than on expeditionary capabilities.
<br>
<br>U.S. Reassurance Does Not Equal NATO Reassurance
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) The U.S. has taken a number of bilateral steps to
<br>reassure the Baltics, including tasking the U.S. European
<br>Command (which ADM Stavridis heads under his U.S.-only hat)
<br>to develop a plan for supporting NATO deterrence and defense
<br>in the Baltic region.  While these efforts can be useful in
<br>supporting NATO contingency planning and reassurance efforts,
<br>if done on their own they could actually undermine our
<br>efforts to reassure the Baltic states that all NATO Allies
<br>will carry out their Article 5 commitments.  Defense of the
<br>Baltics must remain a NATO Article 5 commitment, not solely a
<br>U.S. bilateral one.  Unless consensus can be achieved within
<br>the Alliance to take positive steps in this direction, the
<br>Baltic states will continue to lose faith in the Alliance,
<br>undercutting a key U.S. strategic objective.  Washington
<br>should not allow U.S. bilateral reassurance efforts to become
<br>an easy substitute for NATO-wide efforts.
<br>
<br>Recommended Way Ahead
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Ambassador Daalder has been having quiet
<br>conversations with some Allies, as well as with SACEUR, to
<br>see what might be possible.  We believe that a key aspect of
<br>any approach would be to socialize the NAC on the issue
<br>through briefings by SACEUR on current plans and the extent
<br>to which they satisfy the requirement to defend Allied
<br>territory.  In addition to further consideration of the ideas
<br>in para 6 above, Mission proposes the following as an initial
<br>way ahead on this issue that we should seek to set in train:
<br>
<br>-- The Military Committee should task NATO Military
<br>Authorities to review the current family of contingency plans
<br>to determine if they are sufficient to meet NATO's Article 5
<br>commitments;
<br>
<br>USNATO 00000464  003 OF 003
<br>
<br>-- The North Atlantic Council should ask SACEUR to brief
<br>PermReps on the status of these plans and on their ability to
<br>provide for the defense/protection of Allied territory,
<br>populations, and Alliance interests;
<br>
<br>-- SHAPE should request that each Ally assess its own
<br>national plans and national contributions in support of these
<br>plans;
<br>
<br>-- Strategic communications/public messaging regarding NATO
<br>contingency planning would allow the Alliance to highlight
<br>its efforts to provide for the protection of Alliance
<br>territory from the range of threats;
<br>
<br>-- Ongoing Strategic Concept discussion and seminars should
<br>be used to identify new security threats and ways to meet
<br>those threats.  This process could help build consensus for
<br>new contingency planning efforts;
<br>
<br>-- The U.S. should consider the possibility/suitability of
<br>adapting the upcoming USEUCOM bilateral exercise, "Baltic
<br>Host 2010," into a NATO deterrence and defense of the Baltic
<br>states exercise; and
<br>
<br>-- As NATO contingency plans are developed, task the
<br>development of supporting USEUCOM contingency plans.
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Mission requests that a NATO IPC be scheduled in
<br>the near future to discuss this issue further, with a view to
<br>developing a coherent interagency-agreed strategy on how to
<br>take forward the President's vision of contingency planning
<br>in NATO.
