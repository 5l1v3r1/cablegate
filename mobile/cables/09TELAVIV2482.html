<br>Classified By: DCM Luis G. Moreno, reasons 1.4 (b),(d) 
<br> 
<br>This is a re-transmission of USDAO TEL AVIV 3188. 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On November 1 and 2, Assistant Secretary of 
<br>Defense (ASD) for International Security Affairs, Ambassador 
<br>Alexander Vershbow, met with a number of senior Israeli 
<br>defense officials in Israel including: Ministry of Defense 
<br>(MOD) Director General (DG) Pinchas Buchris; Head of MOD 
<br>Political Military Bureau Amos Gilad; Assistant Chief of 
<br>Defense Major General (MG) Benny Gantz; and Head of MOD 
<br>Intelligence Analysis Production Brigadier General Yossi 
<br>Baidatz.  The Israelis expressed positive views on continued 
<br>U.S.-Israel cooperation particularly on Israel's Qualitative 
<br>Military Edge (QME) and the ongoing Juniper Cobra missile 
<br>defense exercise.  Israeli officials explained that they were 
<br>going through an unprecedented period of calm due to the 
<br>deterrent effect of Operation CAST LEAD, but that below the 
<br>surface were a number of significant dangers.  They continued 
<br>to emphasize that Iran represents the greatest strategic 
<br>threat to the region, both its nuclear program and its "axis" 
<br>with Syria, Hezbollah, and HAMAS.  They also expressed 
<br>skepticism about Palestinian President Abbas's future, given 
<br>his weakened position as a result of his handling of the 
<br>Goldstone Report and his inability to get the full settlement 
<br>freeze he had pushed for; they questioned his ability to 
<br>restart peace negotiations.  Israeli officials were concerned 
<br>about the deteriorating Turkey-Israel relationship and 
<br>discussed threats emanating from both Syria and Lebanon. END 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br> 
<br>------------------- 
<br>Bilateral Relations 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) ASD Vershbow's trip to Israel came as a number of 
<br>high-level Israeli and American officials were meeting on key 
<br>issues.  On October 31, Secretary of State Clinton arrived in 
<br>Jerusalem for talks on the peace process with Prime Minister 
<br>Netanyahu, Defense Minister Barak, and Foreign Minster 
<br>Lieberman.  In addition, EUCOM Commander Admiral Stavridis 
<br>arrived in Israel on November 1 to observe the Juniper 
<br>Cobra-10 ballistic missile defense exercise.  The ASD's visit 
<br>also came in the wake of recent high-level discussions on 
<br>Israel's QME in Washington, and the October 21 meeting of the 
<br>Joint Politico-Military Group in Tel Aviv. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) On QME, ASD Vershbow asked for Israel's assessment of 
<br>recent discussions, and across the board, Israeli officials 
<br>expressed gratitude for U.S. efforts on this front and voiced 
<br>optimism on the steps moving forward.  Amos Gilad 
<br>acknowledged the sometimes difficult position the U.S. finds 
<br>itself in given its global interests, and conceded that 
<br>Israel's security focus is so narrow that its QME concerns 
<br>often clash with broader American security interests in the 
<br>region.  Israeli officials acknowledged the impressive nature 
<br>of the QME dialogue mechanisms recently established, but 
<br>stated that the results of the process are what truly matter. 
<br> MG Benny Gantz defined successful QME relations as "the 
<br>effective process plus the right mitigations."  While not 
<br>explicitly saying it, Gantz seemed to acknowledge that Israel 
<br>does not expect that all QME decisions will break in its 
<br>favor, but that Israel only expects a fair and equitable 
<br>process that incorporates "intimate dialogue."  DG Buchris 
<br>thanked Versbhow for the recent success of the JPMG and said 
<br>he looks forward to convening the first meeting of the agreed 
<br>upon working groups by the end of November.  Vershbow stated 
<br>that the technical working group discussions would be 
<br>launched soon, and that he was looking forward to future 
<br>Israeli participation on this issue. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>Iran Remains Top of Mind 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) Israeli officials continue to uniformly emphasize that 
<br>Iran's nuclear program and regional hegemonic ambitions are 
<br>the greatest strategic threats to Israel.  They view Iran as 
<br>the center of a radical axis that includes Syria, Hezbollah 
<br>and HAMAS. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S//NF) Israel continues to offer a worst-case assessment 
<br>of the Iranian nuclear program, emphasizing that the window 
<br>for stopping the program (by military means if necessary) is 
<br> 
<br>rapidly closing.  General Baidatz argued that it would take 
<br>Iran one year to obtain a nuclear weapon and two and a half 
<br>years to build an arsenal of three weapons.  By 2012 Iran 
<br>would be able to build one weapon within weeks and an arsenal 
<br>within six months.  (COMMENT:  It is unclear if the Israelis 
<br>firmly believe this or are using worst-case estimates to 
<br>raise greater urgency from the United States).  Amos Gilad 
<br>explained his view of the repercussions of an Iranian nuclear 
<br>capability stating that it would give Iran a free hand in 
<br>supporting "HAMAStan" in Gaza and "Hezbollahstan" in Lebanon. 
<br> Gilad also argued that Saudi Arabia would definitely react 
<br>to a nuclear Iran by obtaining a weapon (with Pakistani 
<br>assistance) and Egypt would almost certainly follow.  He was 
<br>less sure about whether Turkey would respond by pursuing a 
<br>nuclear weapon. Regardless, the security situation in the 
<br>region surrounding Israel would be dramatically altered 
<br>should Iran acquire a nuclear weapons capability. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S//NF) ASD Vershbow queried various Israeli officials 
<br>about their view of the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR) 
<br>proposal and Iran's recent equivocation on the agreement. 
<br>Israeli officials uniformly expressed support for the 
<br>agreement but made clear that by itself it was not 
<br>sufficient.  They stated that it was only one stop on the way 
<br>to containing the Iranian nuclear program and that it must be 
<br>followed by a freeze-for-freeze agreement and eventually the 
<br>full suspension of uranium enrichment, as well as the end of 
<br>work on the newly disclosed site at Qom.  They warned that 
<br>the TRR agreement by itself could serve as a major victory 
<br>for Iran if it legitimized in the world's eyes Iran's right 
<br>to enrich uranium on its own soil.  None of the Israeli 
<br>officials expressed surprise about Iran's apparent reversal 
<br>on the TRR agreement, as they viewed this as typical Iranian 
<br>negotiating style and part of an Iranian strategy of delay. 
<br>Amos Gilad stated that Iran would never agree to anything 
<br>that contradicted its overall strategic goal of achieving a 
<br>nuclear weapons capability. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) When queried about how the U.S. views the Iranian 
<br>response, ASD Vershbow explained that the United States was 
<br>still seeking greater clarity on what was the real Iranian 
<br>bottom line.  We may need time to ascertain whether Iran's 
<br>response was in fact a serious walk-back or whether it would 
<br>be willing to abide by the initial TRR agreement that had 
<br>been agreed to in principle in Geneva on October 1.  However, 
<br>he also emphasized that American patience is not unlimited 
<br>and that if the TRR agreement did collapse, the U.S. would 
<br>likely begin pursuing the pressure track. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S//NF) Israel was also highly concerned about Iran's 
<br>support for proxies, with General Baidatz emphasizing that 
<br>there are multiple bases in Iran where IRGC, Quds Force, 
<br>Hezbollah, HAMAS, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives 
<br>all train together and share knowledge.  MG Gantz also 
<br>emphasized Iran's role as a weapons supplier to Syria and 
<br>that Syria actively facilitated arms transfers to Hezbollah. 
<br>He expressed concern about Iranian shipments of weapons via 
<br>Sudan to Egypt and into Gaza.  On the Russian delay in 
<br>delivery of the S-300 (SA-20) to Iran, Gilad voiced 
<br>satisfaction with the train of events, acknowledging Prime 
<br>Minister Netanyahu's "secret" visit to Moscow and President 
<br>Obama's engagement with Medvedev had both played a role. 
<br>Gilad was worried about Russian readiness to support tough 
<br>sanctions on Iran.  ASD Vershbow said the Russians' signals 
<br>on sanctions were mixed, but they seemed genuinely concerned 
<br>about recent Iranian missile tests and the revelation of the 
<br>Qom facility. 
<br> 
<br>------------------- 
<br>West Bank and Gaza 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) Of particular interest throughout the meetings was the 
<br>subject of the Palestinian political situation.  It was 
<br>widely agreed that President Abbas is currently in a weakened 
<br>political state, and Israeli officials generally cast a dour 
<br>assessment of Abbas's future.  In one exchange, Amos Gilad 
<br>stated his opinion that Abbas will not survive politically 
<br>past the year 2011.  Gilad further stated that Abbas is 
<br>facing unprecedented criticism within the Palestinian 
<br>Authority over his handling of the Goldstone report, and that 
<br>this, coupled with a stubborn HAMAS, has weakened Abbas 
<br>considerably.  The Israelis said the perception in the Arab 
<br>world was that the U.S. had encouraged Abbas to take 
<br> 
<br>difficult positions on Goldstone and settlements only to walk 
<br>away from him.  ASD Vershbow queried Gilad over measures that 
<br>could be taken to bolster Abbas.  Gilad responded by stating 
<br>that Israeli-Palestinian peace discussions need to be resumed 
<br>immediately, but without preconditions, and that both parties 
<br>need to seek further cooperation on a range of issues -- 
<br>specifically on the security sector front.  Gilad expressed 
<br>optimism over the current atmosphere in the West Bank, citing 
<br>improvements in the security and economic spheres, and 
<br>further stated that the reduced Israeli Defense Force (IDF) 
<br>footprint in the West Bank has made conditions ripe for 
<br>advancing the relationship.  Gilad closed, however, on a 
<br>sourer note by stating that the Government of Israel has 
<br>little faith in the Palestinian negotiating team. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) ASD Vershbow transitioned off the political 
<br>discussion to focus on the Palestinian Authority Security 
<br>Force (PASF).  Specifically, Vershbow highlighted the concern 
<br>that Palestinian forces were seen as lacking real authority, 
<br>and therefore asked for steps that could be taken to give the 
<br>PASF more visible control of security.  Israeli officials 
<br>responded by citing the decreased number of direct- action 
<br>incursions, checkpoints and patrols, and seemingly drew a 
<br>correlation between reduced IDF activity and increased PASF 
<br>authority (COMMENT:  Despite Israeli assurances, U.S. and 
<br>Palestinian officials continue to highlight the corrosive 
<br>effect of regular Israeli incursions).  MG Gantz cited 
<br>Palestinian security sector reform as a major accomplishment, 
<br>stating that on-the-ground coordination between the PASF and 
<br>IDF units has improved dramatically. Despite these positive 
<br>developments though, Israeli officials repeatedly underscored 
<br>the importance of retaining the right to disrupt terrorist 
<br>operations in the West Bank and Gaza.  Additionally, they 
<br>stated that if Israel allowed a weak and untrained security 
<br>force to take over in the West Bank in the short term, the 
<br>result will be deterioration of the Israel-Jordan 
<br>relationship over the long term.  The prospect of poor 
<br>Israeli-Jordanian relations, according to Amos Gilad, is 
<br>unacceptable, and would result in the loss of "strategic 
<br>depth" for Israel. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S) ASD Vershbow urged his Israeli counterparts not to 
<br>soley focus on the short-term "here and now," but rathr to 
<br>envision the possible benefits that a strongand viable West 
<br>Bank could have for Israel's secrity situation in the 
<br>future.  Vershbow used thi point to springboard to the issue 
<br>of HAMAS and aza, asking whether success in the West Bank 
<br>coud serve as a "magnet" and help solve the Gaza problem. 
<br>He asked if Israel had made any headway in tems of an 
<br>information operations campaign to better communicate with 
<br>the people of Gaza.  Israeli officials offered very little in 
<br>the way of a communications strategy or long-term vision for 
<br>the territories, but reinforced Israel's core belief that 
<br>HAMAS has only sinister motives, and that any attempt Fatah 
<br>might make to improve its standing in Gaza would only be met 
<br>with HAMAS opposition.  General Baidatz articulated Israel's 
<br>concern by highlighting recent intelligence that HAMAS is 
<br>trying to acquire from Iran (and potentially test-fired the 
<br>previous weekend) the 60 km-range Fajr-5 rocket that could 
<br>reach Tel Aviv.  These actions, according to Baidatz and 
<br>other officials, make any discussion of Palestinian 
<br>reconciliation both premature and unrealistic.  Ambassador 
<br>Vershbow sought further clarification on this point, querying 
<br>Israeli officials over the level of public support for HAMAS. 
<br> Specifically, the ASD asked if there was any way to 
<br>undermine support for HAMAS vis-a-vis the peace process. 
<br>Amos Gilad responded simply by saying that one of Israel's 
<br>biggest concerns is the atmosphere created by disjointed 
<br>peace talks.  Specifically, Gilad stated that political 
<br>promises of peace, unification, and reconciliation -- 
<br>concepts that are never realized -- are only resulting in a 
<br>climate of uncertainty that is unhealthy.  On this matter, 
<br>Gilad mentioned that Egypt's role in pushing reconciliation 
<br>is not helpful and often counterproductive, but that he 
<br>expects Egypt to continue floating the idea at future 
<br>junctures. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) In bringing up the Goldstone Report, DG Buchris 
<br>emphasized that the Government of Israel took extraordinary 
<br>steps to mitigate civilian casualties, despite HAMAS's 
<br>deliberate use of civilians as human shields.  He stated that 
<br>the IDF made over 300,000 phone calls to alert civilians 
<br>before bombing legitimate military targets.  He also compared 
<br>Israeli operations in Gaza to U.S. operations in Iraq and 
<br> 
<br>Afghanistan and stated that Israel would do whatever was 
<br>necessary to protect its population.  In response, ASD 
<br>Vershbow recalled U.S. support for Israel in handling of the 
<br>Goldstone report, and offered to share U.S. experience in 
<br>investigating incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan as the GOI 
<br>considered whether to conduct an additional investigation. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>Anxiety Over Turkey 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S) Israeli officials also expressed growing anxiety over 
<br>the Turkey-Israel relationship after the Turkish cancellation 
<br>of Israel's participation in the ANATOLIAN EAGLE joint 
<br>exercise.  They expressed their belief that the strategic 
<br>relationship with Turkey is critical, but that PM Erdogan's 
<br>views have increasingly penetrated into the military and have 
<br>been part of the reason for the deterioration in relations as 
<br>Turkey looks East rather than West.  Gilad believes this is 
<br>understandable as Turkey's EU accession prospects look 
<br>increasingly doubtful, and they must balance their relations 
<br>with both regions to succeed. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S) Baidatz stated that the Turks have an agenda to 
<br>contain any Kurdish influence in Iraq and that to achieve it 
<br>they need to improve their relations with Iran and Syria.  In 
<br>his view, the worst possible outcome would be a new 
<br>Turkey-Iran-Syria-Iraq axis in the Middle East.  Gilad also 
<br>noted that Turkey wanted to improve its relationships with 
<br>Iran and asserted that it had made some very aggressive plans 
<br>recently to support HAMAS.  However, he had a less 
<br>pessimistic view than Baidatz, stating that Turkey had played 
<br>a positive role in Iraq and that generally the Turks' agenda 
<br>was for a stable Iraq that would be commercially beneficial 
<br>to Turkey.  Gilad stated that he was skeptical of any 
<br>political rapprochement between Israel and Turkey in the near 
<br>term, but that Israel would continue to foster the 
<br>military-to-military relationship because of its strategic 
<br>importance. 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) Gilad also queried ASD Vershbow about what Israel 
<br>might do to improve its relationship with Turkey.  Vershbow 
<br>explained that Turkey wants to be influential in the region 
<br>and that if it jeopardizes its relationship with Israel, it 
<br>will undermine its status and its leverage as an evenhanded 
<br>mediator.  He also commented that Erdogan's ideological views 
<br>may lead him to focus on Turkey's Islamic neighbors, but he 
<br>is also a realist who will not want to jeopardize Turkey's 
<br>ties to the U.S. or NATO.  The U.S. and Israel should be 
<br>patient with Turkey and stay engaged, encouraging the Turks 
<br>to play a constructive role in the region.  He stated that at 
<br>the upcoming bilateral defense talks between the U.S. and 
<br>Turkey in December, he and Under Secretary Flournoy would 
<br>emphasize the need to improve Israel-Turkey relations. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>Quiet on the Northern Border 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (S) Israeli officials remain pleased with the "quiet" 
<br>nature of its northern border -- something they attribute to 
<br>the deterrent effect Israel has built up following OPERATION 
<br>CAST LEAD and the 2006 war in Lebano.  However, according to 
<br>Israeli officials, it i a foregone conclusion that strong 
<br>cooperation eists between the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) 
<br>and ezbollah.  The level of cooperation far exceeds wht 
<br>many assume is simply the day-to-day problem of corruption 
<br>within the ranks.  On the contrary, Israel believes that 
<br>LAF/Hezbollah cooperation is a matter of national policy. 
<br>Amos Gilad attributed this dynamic to elements of 
<br>nationalism, stating that Lebanese government and military 
<br>officials choose not to confront Hezbollah out of patriotic 
<br>zeal.  Moreover, according to Gilad, any information shared 
<br>with the United Nations Interim Force-Lebanon (UNIFIL) goes 
<br>directly to Hezbollah by way of the LAF. 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (S) Israeli officials have major concerns over 
<br>developments within Hezbollah -- specifically, its 
<br>relationship with Syria and Iran.  General Baidatz spoke of 
<br>this relationship and drew attention to the existing supply 
<br>of Fateh-110 long-range missile that Iran sent to Syria. 
<br>Israeli officials believe these missiles are destined for 
<br>Hezbollah.  According to Baidatz and others, if the delivery 
<br>were to occur, this would significantly alter Israel's 
<br> 
<br>calculus.  Under such a scenario, the looming question for 
<br>Israeli policymakers then becomes: "to strike or not to 
<br>strike." 
<br> 
<br>----------------- 
<br>Optimism on Syria 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (S) General Baidatz offered an Israeli intelligence 
<br>assessment that if Syria were able to achieve peace with 
<br>security and obtain greater U.S. involvement, it may pull 
<br>away from Iran's orbit.  He explained that President Assad 
<br>used his "negative assets," namely Hezbollah and HAMAS, to 
<br>make himself relevant and that ultimately Assad wants it all: 
<br> the Golan Heights; peace with Israel; better relations with 
<br>the U.S.; a strong relationship with Iran; and a continued 
<br>relationship with Hezbollah.  Ultimately, Gen Baidatz 
<br>asserted that if Assad had to choose one thing, it would 
<br>likely be peace with Israel.  ASD Vershbow asked if Hezbollah 
<br>could be sustained without Syrian support.  Baidatz 
<br>acknowledged the difficulty in answering this question, but 
<br>stated his belief that it would be a gradual process before 
<br>Hezbollah could completely wean itself from the Syrian 
<br>support apparatus and that, ultimately, both Hezbollah's and 
<br>Iran's flexibility would be significantly reduced. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>Mil-to-Mil Relations with Egypt 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) Amos Gilad commented that he would like to see a 
<br>complete peace with Egypt, but noted there was very little in 
<br>the way of Egyptian-Israeli military relations and that Egypt 
<br>continued to train its military for war with Israel.  Gilad 
<br>stated that Egypt was not likely to attack Israel and did not 
<br>represent a short-term threat, but that at the very least it 
<br>was necessary to have modest contact between Egyptian and 
<br>Israeli officers.  He expressed frustration by describing 
<br>Egypt and Israel's "frozen peace" and that neither side knows 
<br>anything about the other.  He noted that the last high-level 
<br>military visit for Egypt was in 1991. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (S//NF) Israeli officials agreed that Egypt's 
<br>counter-smuggling efforts have improved, particularly since 
<br>Operation CAST LEAD in January.  However, they stated that 
<br>gaps still exist and that Egypt needs to focus its efforts on 
<br>stopping Bedouin smuggling in the Sinai.  Gilad said he was 
<br>disillusioned with the technical monitoring solution; tunnels 
<br>continue and smuggling is increasing even with U.S. 
<br>assistance along borders with Egypt. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
<br>Iron Dome and Juniper Cobra - Strengthening the Relationship 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (S) On Iron Dome, DG Buchris (Assisted by retired General 
<br>Nagel) briefed ASD Vershbow on the latest developments, 
<br>stating that Iron Dome is planned to have an initial 
<br>operating capability by the spring of 2010, and that 
<br>technological advancements have made the system much more 
<br>viable defending against short range rocket attacks from Gaza 
<br>or Southern Lebanon.  Buchris also emphasized the need for 
<br>additional USG support to help fund additional production of 
<br>Iron Dome to protect the civilian population in both the 
<br>North and the South.  Buchris also noted progress on the 
<br>upper- and medium-tier ballistic missile defense systems 
<br>(Arrow-3 and David's Sling, respectively).  In an earlier 
<br>meeting, MG Gantz quantified the importance of fielding 
<br>adequate missile defense systems by citing critical Israeli 
<br>infrastructure such as Ben Gurion Airport and the Ashkelon 
<br>electricity plant.  Suffering the loss or damage of places 
<br>such as these, according to Gantz, would be a major blow to 
<br>Israel and, therefore, every effort to 
<br>stand up a capable missile and rocket defense shield should 
<br>be taken. 
<br> 
<br>¶22. (S) After Gantz highlighted three areas of focus for the 
<br>IDF (deterring conventional threats, responding nimbly to 
<br>asymmetric threats, and developing an integrated missile 
<br>defense system), ASD Vershbow asked for Gantz's initial 
<br>impression of the Juniper Cobra-10 exercise.  Gantz stressed 
<br>the importance of this exercise, and stated that so far it 
<br>had been a success.  ASD Vershbow stated that the timing of 
<br>Juniper Cobra was somewhat fortuitous, given the recent 
<br> 
<br>developments with Iran.  On the larger issue of missile 
<br>defense, ASD Vershbow stressed U.S. efforts to try and 
<br>persuade Russia to become more involved in missile defense 
<br>cooperation, but stated that Russia's realization that the 
<br>new U.S. missile defense approach in Europe is more effective 
<br>than the previous one is causing the Russian leadership to 
<br>ask many questions about the system. 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶23. (S) All of ASD Vershbow's interlocutors carried a 
<br>consistent message emphasizing that:  Iran remains Israel's 
<br>greatest threat; recent events have weakened President Abbas; 
<br>the PASF have performed well in the West Bank; and the 
<br>relative calm on all Israel's borders does not obscure the 
<br>fact that Israeli intelligence is seeing significant activity 
<br>and planning by Iranian surrogates, namely HAMAS and 
<br>Hezbollah, with facilitation from Syria.  These threats 
<br>suggest that Israel must remain vigilant and prepared for the 
<br>calm to end one day. 
<br> 
<br>¶24. (U) ASD Vershbow has cleared this message.
