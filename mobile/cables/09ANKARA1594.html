<br>SUBJECT: TURKISH MEDIA REACTION 
<br>WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2009 
<br> 
<br>Media Highlights:  Clinton's Global Partnerships; Commentary on 
<br>Turkey-US-Iraq Relations; New Case Against Incirlik 
<br>Base Extensions; Sabah on USNATO Tour to Afghanistan;  Another 'One 
<br>Minute' Crisis in Rize; Erdogan Makes TGS Demands; Erdogan on 
<br>Turkey's Foreign Policy;  Erdogan Rejects Swine Flu; New Turkish 
<br>University for Kabul; 
<br> 
<br>Clinton's Global Partnerships to Strengthen Muslim Ties 
<br>Turkish media outlets were lukewarm in initial reporting on 
<br>Secretary Clinton's new initiative to boost development around the 
<br>Muslim world.  National broadcaster TRT-TV Online in "Obama's New 
<br>Beginning Plan," notes that "previously, in his June address in 
<br>Cairo, President Obama promised to seek a new start to troubled US 
<br>relations with the Islamic world."  In "Hillary Clinton Offers US 
<br>Aid to Help Boost Muslim Ties," Islamic-oriented Today's Zaman notes 
<br>that  "taken together the new package pales in comparison to the 
<br>billions of dollars in aid that Washington  extends to governments 
<br>in the region, including both Israel and Egypt."   In "New US 
<br>Initiative for the Islamic World," liberal Radikal says, "Secretary 
<br>Clinton, speaking at a development forum in Marrakesh, announced the 
<br>new US initiative with the world's Muslims, to promote 
<br>entrepreneurship, economic development and education."  Mainstream 
<br>Aksam's online page headlines, "Clinton Holds Muslim Initiative in 
<br>Morocco," and notes, "Clinton said the programs would aim to 
<br>encourage scientific and technical collaboration, women's 
<br>empowerment and cooperation between faiths." 
<br> 
<br>Pundits Take Note of Turkey-US and Turkey-Iraq Relations 
<br>Cuneyt Ulsever in mainstream Hurriyet evaluates Turkey's foreign 
<br>policy and says "I am sure Turkey will produce independent policies 
<br>in certain areas, but after Obama was elected as the President and 
<br>Davutoglu assigned as Turkish Foreign Minister, Turkey-US ties 
<br>started settling on a new axis.  Within the framework of Obama's 
<br>multi-centered politics -  which expects active participation from 
<br>the other countries - Turkey is playing for the role of the US 
<br>Representative in the Middle East.  US wants to test Turkey in four 
<br>areas.  First of all the US wants to know whether Turkey will take 
<br>over an active role in Northern Iraq or not.  Secondly, will Turkey 
<br>be able to tame Iran under US' demands.  The US also wants to know 
<br>whether Turkey will be able to take Syria to the US' side.  And 
<br>finally, the US wants to test Turkey whether it will be able to save 
<br>Hamas and Hezbollah from Iran's influence.  If Turkey passes all 
<br>these tests without losing or isolating Israel in the Middle East 
<br>completely, then Turkey will be considered successful, otherwise, 
<br>we'll go back to Bush Administration's period." 
<br> 
<br>Sami Kohen in mainstream Milliyet compares current ties between 
<br>Ankara-Irbil, as compared to last year, and says because of Ankara's 
<br>rationalist and pragmatic strategies, Turkey has improved relations 
<br>with the Northern Iraqi Administration. He comments: "The Kurdish 
<br>Administration in Northern Iraq, with US pressure, supported Turkey 
<br>in its fight against PKK terrorism.  And we came to today's point 
<br>through a series of diplomatic and political initiatives, supported 
<br>by the military.  Good ties with Northern Iraq is necessary for 
<br>Turkey, especially after the US withdrawal from Iraq." 
<br> 
<br>Turkish NGO Goes to Court Against the Use of Incirlik Airbase by the 
<br>US 
<br>Papers report that following an application by the Global Peace and 
<br>Justice Coalition, a Turkish NGO,  the Council of State (Danistay) 
<br>prosecutor has demanded the annulment of a Council of Ministers 
<br>decision made in 2007 to extend the agreement with the US allowing 
<br>the use of Incirlik Airbase for another two years.  The prosecutor 
<br>said the approval of the parliament was needed to extend the mandate 
<br>for using Incirlik AB.  He noted that the parliament, and not the 
<br>Council of Ministers, was to decide whether to authorize a foreign 
<br>troop deployment in Turkey and to use Turkish facilities.  Danistay 
<br>is expected to make a decision on the issue within a month, 
<br>according to papers. 
<br> 
<br>Sabah Multipart Series on Afghanistan 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00001594  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Mainstream-pro government Sabah's diplomatic correspondent Duygu 
<br>Guvenc went on a USNATO tour in October in Afghanistan, reporting on 
<br>the Turkish ISAF contributions and the challenges of civilian 
<br>infrastructure projects in a three part series. She leds off the 
<br>series with a frank assessment of  Turkey's" tough mission" in 
<br>Afghanistan and how Turkey handles many projects there, including 
<br>the police force, education and health services.   In addition to 
<br>ISAF cooperation, she also emphasizes that the future of Afghanistan 
<br>is in civilian hands, noting the need for teachers, engineers and 
<br>doctors.  One part of the series takes a humorous look at life for 
<br>the ISAF forces there, from rock concerts to the delights of Afghani 
<br>bread.  "Now, ISAF is looking for a way out from Afghanistan," she 
<br>observes and notes that  "civilians hold the key for the troop exit 
<br>from Afghanistan." 
<br> 
<br>Turkey-Israel:  A Mini 'One Minute' Crisis in Rize and Calls for Gul 
<br>to Visit Israel 
<br>Hurriyet, Milliyet, Sabah, Aksam, Haberturk, Cumhuriyet, Yeni Safak 
<br>and Zaman report the mayor of the Black Sea province of Rize, Halil 
<br>Bakirci, had an "unpleasant" exchange of remarks during a meeting 
<br>with visiting Israeli Ambassador, Gaby Levy.  Mayor Bakirci told the 
<br>Israeli Ambassador that the attitude of Turkish people toward Israel 
<br>would not change as long as Israel continues its "expansionist 
<br>policies."  "The people of Rize will defend themselves in the face 
<br>of such threats, but they will not kill babies," said Bakirci.  Levy 
<br>responded by saying that Israelis did not have any other 
<br>alternatives for survival.  He admitted that Turkish-Israeli 
<br>relations had entered a difficult period, but added that 
<br>Turkey-Israel bilateral relations had strong roots.  According to 
<br>Turkish media, the mayor went on to express anxiety about the safety 
<br>of the Israeli tourists visiting the Black Sea region, who he said 
<br>were viewed with suspicion but constitute 70 percent of all foreign 
<br>visitors to the area. 
<br> 
<br>Commentary Condemns:  In mainstream Hurriyet, Chief Editor Ertugrul 
<br>Ozkok took aim at the Mayor, criticizing him for his warning that 
<br>"Israeli tourists should not come to Rize" and for voicing concerns 
<br>of Israel policies in Gaza.  According to Ozkok, "if Ankara's harsh 
<br>language spreads internally and turns into warnings to an Ambassador 
<br>from a Mayor, then, it will be difficult for the Turkish foreign 
<br>policy to stretch when it is necessary." 
<br> 
<br>Gul Should Visit Israel:  In mainstream Aksam, columnist Utku 
<br>Cakirozer voices concern that the continuing diplomatic crisis will 
<br>damage Turkey and Israel's strategic interests.  "The heaviest 
<br>portion of the bill will go to Israel, because Turkey is Israel's 
<br>only trustworthy ally in the Islamic world," he opines.  "Foreign 
<br>Ministry officials in both countries and the Ambassadors in two 
<br>capitals, exert extreme efforts to ease the tensions, however, the 
<br>remarks of the politicians in both countries, do not help at all. 
<br>We believe that, at this point, President Gul can play the most 
<br>constructive role to eliminate the tensions.  If President Gul pays 
<br>a visit to Israel, the relationship between Ankara-Tel-Aviv will 
<br>reach the much deserved strategic level again." 
<br> 
<br>Erdogan Calls on TGS to Turn In Anti-Government Conspirators 
<br>Papers report Prime Minister Erdogan, on an alleged military plot 
<br>against his government, called on the TGS Chief General Ilker Basbug 
<br>to bring to justice the suspects who drafted the plan for fighting 
<br>fundamentalism.  Erdogan wanted the army to hand over Colonel Dursun 
<br>Cicek, the author of the plan, and five other military officers to 
<br>the prosecutor.  TV and print media also carry reports of a new 
<br>wrinkle in the Ergenekon crisis with the publication if a new 
<br>"military memorandum" on fundamentalism.  Media report that last 
<br>night an unidentified officer e-mailed a copy of another secret TGS 
<br>memo dated April 2009, to the 'Ergenekon' prosecutor and media 
<br>outlets.  The new memo indicates that 430 websites, including the 
<br>NYT, the New York Post, The Independent, ANF, DIHA, Bianet, the AFP 
<br>and the WP, were monitored.  Wire services reported that 292 of them 
<br>were in Turkish and 138 in foreign languages.  They were categorized 
<br>as "separatist," "fundamentalist," "nationalist," "extreme left," 
<br> 
<br>ANKARA 00001594  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>"pro-EU" and "unbiased."  The memo was signed by eight officers, 
<br>including Colonel Cicek.  It was presented to then TGS Deputy Chief, 
<br>General Hasan Igsiz.  The memo also listed the websites used by the 
<br>TGS for psychological warfare, say papers. 
<br> 
<br>Erdogan: Turkey in Close Ties both with West and Islamic World 
<br>All papers report Prime Minister Erdogan on Tuesday told his ruling 
<br>AK Party group meeting that Turkey was "not shifting" its foreign 
<br>policy, but was only getting "normalized."  Erdogan emphasized 
<br>Turkey was in close relationship both with the West and the Islamic 
<br>world.  "Defending the rights and humanity in the face of the 
<br>Israeli atrocities in Gaza cannot be characterized as shifting 
<br>politics," said Erdogan. 
<br> 
<br>Erdogan-Akdag Disagreement on Swine Flu Vaccines Lead to Confusion 
<br>All papers report Erdogan's controversial rejection of the swine flu 
<br>vaccination, just as swine flu vaccinations began in Turkey and the 
<br>death toll hit eleven.  Health Minister Recep Akdag was vaccinated 
<br>in front of TV cameras as part of the nationwide swine flu 
<br>vaccination campaign.  Prime Minister Erdogan, however, said he will 
<br>not get vaccinated, adding he did not agree with the health minister 
<br>that it should be compulsory.  Akdag said the prime minister was not 
<br>in the group at risk for contracting the virus, and that citizens 
<br>would make their own choice about the vaccination. Erdogan's remarks 
<br>also led to confusion over the effectiveness of the vaccine, say 
<br>papers.  Eyup Can in Hurriyet  writes that the PM has more concerns 
<br>regarding the vaccination campaign which the public doesn't know. 
<br>"Otherwise," he says, " the PM would not be concerned that if 
<br>anything goes wrong with the campaign, his government would get all 
<br>the blame." 
<br> 
<br>Turkey to Establish University in Kabul (Zaman) 
<br>Islamist-oriented Zaman reports Turkey would establish Mevlana 
<br>University in Kabul, upon demands coming from President Karzai that 
<br>Afghanistan's education needs be met.  In the first phase, an 
<br>Education Faculty will be set up.  Afghanistan will need 100,000 
<br>more teachers by the beginning of 2010, says Zaman.  There is 
<br>currently eight Turkish schools in Afghanistan, including two high 
<br>schools for girls.
