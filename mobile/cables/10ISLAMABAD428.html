<br>Classified By: Ambassador Anne W. Patterson for reasons 1.4 (b, d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: In a February 16 meeting with President 
<br>Zardari, Senator Kerry said that India was "very open" to 
<br>constructive talks with Pakistan, and urged Pakistan to reach 
<br>an agreement with India on counter terrorism. Zardari said 
<br>with U.S. support, talks could move forward. He said he 
<br>doubted broad talks with the Taliban were possible, specific 
<br>regional efforts might succeed. Pakistan was fighting 
<br>militants in Pakistan on a "shoe-string" budget, but Zardari 
<br>said that he was committed to finding ways to undermine the 
<br>pull towards militancy in Pakistani society. Kerry said that 
<br>the GOP needed to rebuild conflict-affected areas to cement 
<br>military gains against the insurgency. Kerry encouraged 
<br>Zardari to develop trade agreements with Pakistan's neighbors 
<br>and agreed to Zardari's request to build consensus for 
<br>liberalizing U.S. trade with Pakistan. Zardari lamented that 
<br>he was "a casualty of the world recession," and requested 
<br>U.S. support to relieve IMF conditions on the Pakistani 
<br>economy. He said he needed "a deal" with the United States 
<br>to strengthen his political position. End Summary.

<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Senator John Kerry opened the February 16 meeting with 
<br>President Asif Ali Zardari by referring to his recent talks 
<br>with Indian PM Manmohan Singh and Pakistani PM Yousuf Raza 
<br>Gilani (reftel). Kerry said Singh was "very open" to 
<br>negotiation with Pakistan, starting with the upcoming 
<br>discussions between Pakistan and India's Foreign Secretaries. 
<br>Kerry said that cooperation on counter terrorism with the 
<br>Indians could lead to Indian compromises on key Pakistani 
<br>issues such as Kashmir and water use in subsequent meetings. 
<br>Kerry encouraged the GOP to come up with specific offers to 
<br>which the GOI could respond. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Zardari agreed dialogue is the only way forward. 
<br>However, he justified continued suspicion of India, citing 
<br>recent "confirmation" that there was Indian involvement in 
<br>the Mumbai attacks. He claimed India had increased its 
<br>military spending 30 percent this year and described this as 
<br>a direct threat to Pakistan. When Kerry pointed out the 
<br>Chinese threat to India, Zardari responded that Indian tanks 
<br>cannot operate in the Chinese border region and could only be 
<br>intended for an attack on Pakistan. India has 4,700 tanks, 
<br>he explained, while Pakistan has only 2,600. "Capability 
<br>creates a fear," he added. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Kerry said Zardari should put his concerns on the 
<br>negotiating table as there was a real opportunity for 
<br>productive conversation between India and Pakistan now: "You 
<br>could arrive at a surprising consensus of mutual 
<br>understanding." Zardari conceded that Singh deserved 
<br>respect, but said he was not confident about the rest of the 
<br>Indian government. 
<br>
<br>Zardari,s Take on Afghanistan and Iran 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Kerry asked Zardari what affect President Obama's 
<br>announcement of a U.S. drawdown date had had on the 
<br>possibility of success in Afghanistan. Zardari answered that 
<br>it had given a boost to those fighting against the United 
<br>States, but that they "live in illusion." Zardari doubted 
<br>that the U.S. would actually leave Afghanistan in two and a 
<br>half years, adding that "no one can afford that." Kerry 
<br>asked if dialogue with the Taliban was possible. Zardari 
<br>gave a qualified yes: in specific regions, like Quetta, 
<br>dialogue might be possible, but on a larger scale it was not. 
<br>Kerry asked to what degree events in Iran have an impact in 
<br>Pakistan. Zardari said Iran needs to be engaged, and 
<br>recounted his visit to Iran as an emissary of the "free 
<br>world."

<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Kerry noted that, with the December mosque bombing in 
<br>Rawalpindi, Pakistani terrorism had changed. He asked if 
<br>Pakistan was going to commit to doing whatever it takes to 
<br>get rid of extremism. Zardari replied that he was thinking 
<br>of the future and what will win people away from extremism in 
<br>ten or fifteen years. He added, however, that he was 
<br>"fighting a war on a shoestring budget." 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Kerry said the GOP needed to rebuild the 
<br>conflict-affected areas as soon as possible. He explained 
<br>that new roads, power plants, and health clinics need to go 
<br>in quickly or any progress made in vanquishing the militants 
<br>and extremists would be lost. Zardari agreed but added that 
<br>the war went beyond these areas. He explained that when a 
<br>U.S. soldier leaves Afghanistan, he no longer fears for his 
<br>life; when a Pakistani soldier leaves the conflict areas, 
<br>however, he has to worry that militants might target him in 
<br>his home in Punjab or Sindh. 
<br>
<br>Trade, not Aid 
<br>- - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Zardari complained that Reconstruction Opportunity 
<br>Zones (ROZs) were too confined and requested broader trade 
<br>concessions for Pakistan. Kerry said that, given the 
<br>increase in troops in Afghanistan and the subsequent 
<br>increased U.S. demand on Pakistan, he would see if greater 
<br>trading concessions for Pakistan as a whole could be included 
<br>in an upcoming security package. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Kerry warned, however, that his ability to push for a 
<br>liberalized trade agreement between Pakistan and the U.S. was 
<br>directly tied to Pakistan's democratic stability and 
<br>continued cooperation in supporting Afghanistan and defeating 
<br>terrorists. Every time there is a "hiccough" in Pakistan's 
<br>support, Kerry explained, Congress waivers on giving Pakistan 
<br>additional concessions or aid. As Pakistan was a new 
<br>democracy, Zardari said there would naturally be many 
<br>"hiccoughs," but added, "message understood." Kerry said 
<br>that Pakistan also needed to create trade agreements with its 
<br>neighbors, which would let the Pakistani public know that the 
<br>GOP was committed to real economic improvement. 
<br>
<br>Pakistan Nuclear Assistance 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Kerry said that the lingering A.Q. Khan network 
<br>remained "an albatross" around Pakistan's neck. Pakistan's 
<br>ability to reach a new security arrangement with India and 
<br>the increased strength of Pakistan's democratic institutions 
<br>would be necessary conditions for the U.S. to consider 
<br>civilian nuclear assistance to Pakistan. 
<br>
<br>Something for the People of Pakistan 
<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Zardari expressed his gratitude for U.S. assistance 
<br>to Pakistan. He opined that he was "a casualty of the world 
<br>recession" and needed something to give his people, as all 
<br>they had since he came to power were price increases. 
<br>Zardari requested that the USG weigh in with the IMF against 
<br>further electricity tariff increases. Another increase, he 
<br>warned, would result in riots in the streets. However, 
<br>Zardari promised to broaden the tax base and implement a 
<br>Value-added Tax (VAT), as required by the IMF Stand-by 
<br>Arrangement. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Zardari said poverty, uncertainty, and the lack of 
<br>educational and employment opportunities undermined 
<br>Pakistan's potential as well as his political standing. 
<br>Zardari said he needs a "deal" to show his people that he has 
<br>something to offer them, and that assistance and trade 
<br>concessions were prerequisites to "be able to think about 
<br>India." 
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) This cable was drafted after Senator Kerry departed 
<br>Pakistan.
