<br>Introduction
<br>------------
<br>
<br>¶1. Despite lower demand for wood products due to the global
<br>economic crisis and implementation of the Lacey Act Amendment,
<br>illegal logging in Russia continues at critical levels.
<br>Approximately 70 percent of Russia's forests are concentrated in
<br>the Russian Far East and Siberia in close proximity to China and
<br>other main timber markets in the Asia Pacific Region. Logging
<br>activity and exports increased significantly in 1990s due to the
<br>high demand for timber in those countries. According to the
<br>World Wildlife Fund, official customs documents show that the
<br>volume of timber officially declared and exported from Russia to
<br>China and Japan is at least 20 percent lower than the volume
<br>officially imported by those countries. That difference
<br>accounts for just some of the illegal timber leaving Russia.
<br>Enormous illegal harvests of cedar and other valuable or rare
<br>species have been occurring throughout the region, including
<br>within supposedly protected nature preserves with far reaching
<br>ecological and social impacts.
<br>
<br>Increased Tariffs Lead to Greater Illegal Exports
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----
<br>
<br>¶2. Legal exports remained high until 2007, when, in order to
<br>encourage domestic reprocessing of Russian timber, the Kremlin
<br>increased export tariffs for round wood to 20 per cent of its
<br>delivery price. The tariff was again increased by 25 per cent
<br>in April 2008. China and Japan remained the main consumers of
<br>wood, though volumes of timber export decreased slightly. As a
<br>result, wood export via Grodekovo, the main railroad customs
<br>point in Primorye, decreased from 7.3 million tons in 2007 to
<br>6.2 million tons of timber in 2008. Moscow had planned to
<br>further increase the tariff to 80 per cent in January 2009 -- a
<br>level that in effect serves as a timber export ban -- but has
<br>postponed its implementation for a year. An environmental
<br>contact of the Consulate stated that though the current
<br>financial crisis has lowered overall demand for wood products,
<br>the proportion of illegally-harvested wood will increase because
<br>of increased export tariffs and declining profitability for
<br>larger, legal logging firms. Demand for hard wood is down, but
<br>demand for soft wood, like pine, is up. Pine nuts are a source
<br>of sustenance for wild boar, which are in turn a food source for
<br>predators like leopards and tigers.
<br>
<br>Poaching Occurs Throughout the Russian Far East
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>
<br>¶3. Illegal logging is generally concentrated in border areas,
<br>where it is less expensive to ship wood to processing facilities
<br>in China. The largest illegal cutting operations in Russia are
<br>located in the areas of the Russian Far East and Siberia
<br>neighboring China. Primorye is a leading area for illicit
<br>cutting, but numerous illegal operations have been discovered in
<br>Khabarovsk Krai, and Amur and Jewish Autonomous Oblasts in 2008.
<br>In summer 2008 authorities discovered a poaching operation in
<br>the Dalnerechensk district north of Vladivostok that had
<br>illegally clear cut over 2,300 cubic meters of timber including
<br>1,500 cubic meters of Korean Cedar. That endangered species is
<br>very popular in China for furniture and the pine nuts provide
<br>important sustenance for regional fauna.
<br>
<br>¶4. In 2008, Oleg Mitvol, former Director of Rosprirodnadzor
<br>(Russia's Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resources)
<br>reported numerous timber industry violations in Amur Oblast.
<br>Investigators found documentation stating that 6,000 cubic
<br>meters of timber was officially harvested in the oblast's
<br>Shimanovsk district, but railroad documents recorded 56,000
<br>cubic meters of timber shipped from the district over the same
<br>period.
<br>
<br>How It's Done
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶5. Smugglers use various ways to illicitly export illegal
<br>timber, most of which are able to pass through customs
<br>inspections and established border crossings using fake
<br>documents and fraudulent declarations. Often companies mix
<br>illegally harvested wood into shipments of legally procured
<br>product. They also make customs declarations passing off
<br>valuable and prohibited species as low-value, legal timber.
<br>Smugglers of course also resort to clandestine export without
<br>documents and through unguarded areas of the border. In early
<br>January, authorities caught a Chinese company attempting to
<br>export 4,000 cubic meters of oak and ash valued at 2 million
<br>dollars from Primorye using fake export documents.
<br>
<br>¶6. Illegal export often involves corruption and complicity by
<br>the authorities. Two officers from the Khabarovsk Regional
<br>Service for Economic Crimes who were detained in spring 2007
<br>were eventually found guilty of abuse of office while aiding
<br>Chinese and Russian logging companies in illegally harvesting
<br>
<br>Vladivosto 00000005 002.2 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>and exporting Russian timber. Though it is a positive sign that
<br>officials were found guilty of corruption, their penalty was
<br>light -- in early 2008, their sentences were suspended and they
<br>were released, though guidelines allowed for prison terms of up
<br>to ten years.
<br>
<br>Rangers and Citizens Demand Help to Fight Poachers
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶7. Last year, a group of 38 Primorye park rangers and
<br>environmentalists sent a petition to Prime Minister Vladimir
<br>Putin asking him to transfer management the region's forests
<br>from Primorye authorities to the Federal Forestry Agency. The
<br>signatories asserted that the regional government is
<br>consistently failing to fulfill its responsibility to prevent
<br>illegal logging. Although a new Federal Forest Code came into
<br>effect in January 2007 requiring regional authorities to protect
<br>woodlands, Primorye officials have yet to create and adequately
<br>fund an effective forest management system. Residents
<br>frustrated by inaction have staged protests to attract attention
<br>to illegal logging and have even tried to take forest protection
<br>into their own hands. The World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) Russian
<br>Far East branch and other environmental organizations often lend
<br>support.
<br>
<br>¶8. In summer 2008, residents of a village north of Vladivostok
<br>staged a protest against officially-approved "sanitary cutting,"
<br>when logging companies harvest dead trees and clean woodlands
<br>after wildfires. According to villagers, loggers instead clear
<br>cut everything, including healthy trees and left behind
<br>wastelands in place of viable forests. Loggers have taken
<br>advantage of the fact that forest rangers, suffering from a lack
<br>of regional funding, have drastically reduced staff and
<br>curtailed patrols.
<br>
<br>¶9. Loggers are reportedly now setting their sights on 22,000
<br>hectares of premium restricted forest in Pozharskiy Rayon.
<br>Setting a dangerous precedent, authorities issued three permits
<br>in 2007 to cut 5,600 cubic meters of timber after a seasonal
<br>wildfire had occurred. In the wake of this year's spring
<br>wildfires authorities increased the quota to 20,000 cubic meters
<br>in order to "clean up" the area. Local villagers suspect that
<br>most of that quota will come from perfectly healthy trees
<br>unaffected by fire. xxxxx, told the Consulate
<br>Econ section that he suspected loggers may set fire to woodlands
<br>in order to obtain permission to log the areas afterward. He
<br>affirmed that environmentalists are ready to support villagers
<br>in protecting the forests.
<br>
<br>Retribution Against Environmentalists
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. This past winter, unknown perpetrators set ablaze the house
<br>of Yuriy Bersenev, a WWF project coordinator who works to
<br>safeguard protected nature reserves. Two earlier attempts to
<br>threaten or endanger WWF staff, including another case of arson,
<br>occurred last month in the village of Novaya Moskva in
<br>southeastern Primorye. According to WWF and nature preserve
<br>workers, the local "Forest Mafia" -- a band of people engaged in
<br>illegal timber cutting -- has openly declared war on those
<br>working to preserve forests and enforce environmental laws.
<br>Bersenev said the escalation is a result of the weakness of
<br>national forest legislation and rampant corruption in the
<br>Russian Far East. The perpetrators of both cases remain
<br>unknown.
<br>
<br>Villagers Suffer in More Ways than One
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. Along with dealing with the effects of illegal logging,
<br>honest villagers also face trouble following local laws
<br>themselves. For example, when large logging companies own the
<br>rights to forests nearby, villagers are often forced to travel
<br>twenty kilometers or more to legally gather firewood for their
<br>own subsistence. Such a story was confirmed by the Consul
<br>General during his visit to the remote town of Krasny Yar, an
<br>eleven hour drive from Vladivostok. The town is surrounded by
<br>birch, cedar, and pine forest, but residents are prohibited from
<br>gathering wood nearby.
<br>
<br>Lack of Jobs Leads to Poaching
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. Many villages throughout the region were originally
<br>established as logging towns during the Soviet era. Legitimate
<br>job opportunities have dwindled since then, and the current
<br>global financial crisis has made life there even more difficult.
<br>Many of the jobless former-loggers have resorted to
<br>smaller-scale, ad-hoc -- and illegal -- harvesting of wood.
<br>Providing their services to the "Forest Mafia" is often their
<br>only source of income. With the drop in industrial production
<br>
<br>Vladivosto 00000005 003.2 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>over the border in China, the price of a cubic meter of spruce
<br>has dropped from 120 USD to 60. Established companies are often
<br>finding it more profitable to use the services of these
<br>out-of-work villagers cutting down trees in unauthorized areas
<br>than to use legal, established channels.
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶13. According to xxxxx expert xxxxx 50 percent of soft wood
<br>and 90 percent of hardwood harvested in the Russian Far East and
<br>Siberia eventually ends up in the US as finished goods after
<br>being processed in China. The Lacey Act Amendment, which
<br>requires documentation that wood products sold in the U.S. were
<br>obtained legally and sustainably, may help stem the flow of
<br>illegal timber coming from the Russian Far East. Post would
<br>welcome and be happy to assist NGO's or USG experts who could
<br>provide timber companies with briefings on the Lacey Act
<br>Amendment and the implications for wood products originating in
<br>Russia.
