<br>SUBJECT: MARCH 2010 REGIONAL ELECTIONS PREVIEW SARKOZY'S
<br>STRENGTH AT MID-TERM
<br>
<br>Classified By: POL M/C Kathy Allegrone for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  French regional elections scheduled for
<br>March 2010 are shaping up as a measurement of President
<br>Nicolas Sarkozy's strength at the mid-point of his term.
<br>Despite rumors of malaise and dogged by a series of internal
<br>political tempests including the Clearstream trial, rumors of
<br>his Culture Minister's participation in sex tourism, and his
<br>son Jean's appointment to a coveted business position amidst
<br>charges of nepotism, no other political figure or party can
<br>match the dominance of Sarkozy on the French political scene.
<br>The opposition Socialists (PS) are in tatters, with Martine
<br>Aubry, as Party Chairman, vying for control of the left
<br>against her bitter rival, 2007 PS presidential candidate,
<br>Segolene Royale.  With Sarkozy's UMP controlling only two of
<br>22 regions, and following their impressive victory in the
<br>European elections last June, the center-right appears to
<br>have nothing to lose.  The debate has been how many more
<br>regions will tip their way -- and what will constitute
<br>victory.  Regional councils play a role in the selection of
<br>French Senators, and by extension that body can take on a
<br>different complexion than the UMP-controlled National
<br>Assembly.  As the only national vote before the 2012
<br>presidential and legislative races, all eyes view this round
<br>of regional elections as a preview Sarkozy's reelection bid.
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Regional elections will be held in France in mid-March
<br>2010 to elect local leadership for the 22 regions of mainland
<br>France and four additional overseas regions.  In 2005,
<br>Socialists overwhelmed the UMP in the regional elections,
<br>winning all but two regions.  The huge Socialist victory was
<br>viewed widely as a repudiation of then-President Chirac's
<br>leadership.  As the only nationwide elections before the 2012
<br>presidential and legislative elections, "the regionals" are
<br>viewed as a referendum on Nicolas Sarkozy's leadership and a
<br>snapshot of parties' relative strength heading into 2012.
<br>
<br>Mechanics
<br>---------
<br>
<br>¶3.  (U) As elsewhere in Europe, regional elections in France
<br>are a confusing system combining proportional and majority
<br>voting.  Like other elections in France, voters choose a
<br>party list, or slate of candidates, representing various
<br>parties.  Any list winning 10% of the vote in the first round
<br>of elections (likely to be on March 14 or 21, 2010), advances
<br>to a second round of elections (one week later, thus either
<br>March 21 or 28, 2010).  Parties that win only 5% of the vote
<br>may join efforts with other parties to advance to the second
<br>round.  If one party wins 25% of the votes, they win the
<br>right to form the regional council; the remaining seats are
<br>divided proportionally depending on the results of the second
<br>round.
<br>
<br>Sarkozy's Dominance, Despite Governing Woes
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Regional councils finance education, transport and
<br>other key infratructure, and are locked in a struggle with
<br>national authorities over taxation.  They also participate,
<br>along with other municipalities, in the selection process of
<br>French Senators, and will do so again in September 2011.
<br>With only two regions controlled by conservative majorities
<br>(in Alsace and Corsica), President Sarkozy would welcome
<br>extending his political dominance to regional councils, to
<br>match his lionized role in the executive and legislative
<br>branches.  But Sarkozy faces his own challenges, and the
<br>press is abuzz about malaise in his administration, as well
<br>as Sarkozy's "monarchial tendencies."  Concretely, Sarkozy
<br>first urged cabinet members to head the UMP ticket in various
<br>regions.  He then flipped and decided it was incompatible to
<br>hold both jobs simultaneously.  That decision forced three
<br>ministers to opt out of running in regional races, and has
<br>left the President's UMP party ill prepared for March,
<br>scrambling to find suitable candidates. Sarkozy has also been
<br>dogged by recent scandals, including his Culture Minister
<br>Frederic Mitterrand's dalliance in possible sex tourism.
<br>Mitterand chronicled his appetite for paying for sex with
<br>young men in a 2005 book (that Sarkozy described as
<br>"courageous") but subsequently publicly denied and condemned
<br>"sexual tourism," and vigorously denied that any of his
<br>actions extended to under-aged youth.  Sarkozy has come in
<br>for withering criticism when news broke that his 23-year old
<br>son, Jean, an undergraduate law student, was to be named head
<br>of the regional business authority of France's premier
<br>business district, La Defense.  Both the Mitterrand affair
<br>and the apparent favoritism enjoyed by the younger Sarkozy
<br>have given the president's opponents two potential campaign
<br>issues, that could damage his party's chances in the upcoming
<br>regionals.

<br>
<br>Weakened Opposition Focused on Infighting
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5.  (C) Despite the challenges facing Sarkozy, other parties
<br>are far from fighting shape.  The opposition Socialists (PS)
<br>are locked in their own internecine struggle for dominance
<br>between party leader, Martine Aubry, and 2007 presidential
<br>candidate, Segolene Royal.  Sarkozy confidant Alain Minc told
<br>Ambassador Rivkin in September, 2009 that he was a close
<br>friend of Aubry's whom he had known since their days at
<br>France's Ecole Naitonale d'Administration (ENA), and that
<br>Aubry told him she ran for the PS leadership in order to clip
<br>Royale's wings.  The PS is preoccupied with how to position
<br>the party for the 2012 presidential race, either by forming a
<br>broad left coalition, or moving into alliance with the
<br>centrist Mouvement Democratique (MoDem) party.
<br>
<br>¶6.  (SBU) The PS faces a real challenge from its left, with
<br>the Green party hoping to repeat their surprisingly strong
<br>showing in European parliamentary elections.  The Greens have
<br>refused to run with PS in the first round of regional
<br>elections and are counting on the growing profile of their 34
<br>year old leader, Cecile Duflot to win in Paris.  A Green win
<br>in high-profile Paris would be a serious rebuke to the PS,
<br>and if repeated elsewhere in France could precipitate Aubry's
<br>ouster from her leadership role in the PS.
<br>
<br>¶7.  (SBU) MoDem will be challenged by a new group of
<br>centrists called Nouveau Centre, which is largely allied with
<br>Sarkozy's UMP.  Neither party is expected to win any regional
<br>contest, but there is an open question of where MoDem will
<br>throw its support in a second round of elections.  Their
<br>electoral results will be watched closely as a barometer for
<br>the 2012 presidential race, and whether MoDem will join
<br>forces with the PS to create a united coalition to oppose
<br>Sarkozy in 2012.
<br>
<br>¶8.  (C) The far right National Front (FN) will focus its
<br>efforts in the Provence Alpes Cote d'Azur (PACA) region in
<br>southern France, a traditional area of support.  With his
<br>party's finances in tatters and its traditional themes
<br>co-opted by Sarkozy's UMP, this race likely represents Jean
<br>Marie Le Pen's final campaign.  He has passed the torch to
<br>his daughter, Marine, who broke the Frederic Mitterrand
<br>story, largely to energize her flagging campaign.  Fearing
<br>association with the FN, other mainstream political parties
<br>were slow to criticize Mitterrand, although some PS leaders
<br>eventually joined the chorus calling for his resignation.
<br>
<br>¶9.  (C) Comment:  Although the Mitterrand story has largely
<br>disappeared, it has been replaced since by the embarrassing
<br>issue of Jean Sarkozy's likely election to head the La
<br>Defense business district.  Combined, these stories have
<br>bolstered the impression that Sarkozy is operating in a zone
<br>of monarch-like impunity, and his aides, according to an
<br>article in Le Figaro, are unwilling to question the
<br>President's views. UMP party leaders have turned to the
<br>traditional canard of lashing out at the media for their
<br>unfair attention, but they have just as quickly sought to
<br>lower expectations for a strong conservative comeback in the
<br>March 2010 elections.  After losing 13 regions in 2005, UMP
<br>election expert Alain Marleix said winning six back was a
<br>possibility, but that estimate was lowered by UMP President
<br>Xavier Bertrand, who said this week that a center-right win
<br>in four would "be a miracle."  Regardless of the result,
<br>Sarkozy will head into 2012 enjoying an outsized role in the
<br>French political firmament -- beloved by some, reviled by
<br>others -- and the failure of the opposition to do anything
<br>other than bicker amongst themselves spells a positive
<br>forecast as Sarkozy eyes a re-election bid in two more years.
