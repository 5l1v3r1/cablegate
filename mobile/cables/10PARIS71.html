<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Staffdel Kessler, representing the House Committee on 
<br>Foreign Affairs, visited Paris January 12-14 to engage French 
<br>officials, non-government entities and the private sector 
<br>regarding Iran, sanctions, non-proliferation and Afghanistan. 
<br> With a main focus of discussing potential U.S. sanctions 
<br>legislation related to Iranian efforts to develop weapons of 
<br>mass destruction, the staffdel heard from a wide spectrum of 
<br>French players.  Most of the opinions supported USG efforts 
<br>as France has been a strong ally, especially regarding Iran 
<br>and Afghanistan.  While the usefulness of sanctions continues 
<br>to be debated, French officials said their government was 
<br>moving forward with haste, and bringing the European Union 
<br>(EU) with it, to prepare enhanced sanctions against Iran. 
<br>Even the French political opposition appears on board with 
<br>this plan.  While challenges abound in Afghanistan, the 
<br>Government of France (GOF) remains firmly committed to NATO's 
<br>mission there.  Total company senior representatives 
<br>explained to the staffdel members that its activities in Iran 
<br>are completely legal, small in scope and that it has not been 
<br>able to complete its buy out program there due to 
<br>foot-dragging by the Tehran regime.  Highlights of Staffdel 
<br>Kessler's meetings in Paris are as follows.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>IRAN: OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S VIEW 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) In a January 13 meeting with members of Staffdel 
<br>Kessler, Francois Richier, Strategic Affairs Advisor to 
<br>President Sarkozy, addressed the issue of imposing enhanced 
<br>sanctions against Iran.  Richier explained that the GOF was 
<br>developing a package of measures that largely targeted the 
<br>Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps because of its economic 
<br>holdings and its role as a weapons proliferator.  This 
<br>package would include: 
<br> 
<br>--Finance - The GOF is willing to include the Iranian Central 
<br>Bank in targeted sanctions, most likely through some of its 
<br>subsidiary bodies.  Paris is also trying to target an Iranian 
<br>Sovereign Wealth Fund which it recently learned has a branch 
<br>in Germany.  France would also seek to impose sanctions that 
<br>would cut Iran's ability to conduct "correspondent banking." 
<br> 
<br>--Transport - These sanctions would ban Iranian ships from 
<br>ports and harbors in Europe.  The French envision the 
<br>possibility of enhanced sanctions that would trace Iranian 
<br>ships that have been re-flagged to obscure their origin.  In 
<br>addition, Iranian air cargo planes would be banned from EU 
<br>airports. 
<br> 
<br>--Insurance and re-insurance - Given the limited number of 
<br>actors in the re-insurance industry, France believes 
<br>prohibiting re-insurance coverage in Iran would be an 
<br>effective sanction. 
<br> 
<br>--Oil and Gas - Paris proposes a ban on technical cooperation 
<br>and investment in Iran, a well as prohibiting exports of 
<br>refinery equipment and spare parts for oil and gas 
<br>industries. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Richier said he expects the EU will agree to 
<br>"complement" any eventual UN Security Council Resolution 
<br>(UNSCR) and France hopes for a short timeline to secure a new 
<br>UNSCR in early February before securing approval at the 
<br>Council of EU Foreign Ministers later that month.  Richier 
<br>said that we will have to decide whether to accept grudging 
<br>Russian concessions in order to get a UNSCR that may be weak 
<br>and limited, or whether to "waste time" trying to lobby for a 
<br>UNSCR that will be, at best, only marginally better.  Richier 
<br>noted that it would be helpful if the U.S. Congress did not 
<br>act on sanctions legislation at least until the UNSCR debate 
<br>is concluded and he said it might be best to have U.S. 
<br>sanctions legislation reference the new UN resolution. 
<br>Regarding potential Chinese opposition, he hoped for 
<br>agreement on a new UNSCR (as the prior ones were unanimous), 
<br>but would accept a simple abstention.  Richier expects Russia 
<br>will support the measure because the Russians were "shocked" 
<br>by the discovery of the uranium enrichment site in Qom. 
<br>Nevertheless, the Russians still need time to adjust their 
<br>thinking to this reality. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) European countries face three main difficulties in 
<br>deciding on sanctions against Iran, according to Richier, and 
<br>he outlined them as follows: 
<br> 
<br>--Most European countries want a UN framework, including a 
<br>new UNSCR.  Richier pointed out that a signal from the Obama 
<br>administration that we are also prepared to move forward 
<br> 
<br>would be very helpful. 
<br> 
<br>--Determining the nature of sanctions: Some EU countries want 
<br>to put the UN decision into EU law, but the French want to go 
<br>beyond that and target different sanctions that we are 
<br>unlikely to get from the next UNSCR. 
<br> 
<br>--Some countries simply hesitate to support sanctions for a 
<br>variety of reasons, whether protecting their own economic 
<br>interests, or on ideological grounds.  This is manageable, 
<br>but complicated by individual circumstances, according to 
<br>Richier. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The GOF remains  concerned about enforcing 
<br>sanctions with Brazil and Turkey, said Richier, because both 
<br>have considerable ties to Iran.  He said that Turkey has made 
<br>clear it does not want to suffer economically, as it has in 
<br>the past.  Richier noted France's concern over Turkey's 
<br>"regional policy" towards Iran, whereas it views Brazil's 
<br>engagement as being more nave and possibly based on 
<br>misinterpretation of the Obama decision to try engagement 
<br>first (without Brazil knowing what limits on that engagement 
<br>should be). 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Richier was skeptical that sanctions aimed at 
<br>exporters of refined oil to Iran would be effective, although 
<br>the GOF has pushed for this, because such a policy would 
<br>require a verification mechanism requiring an investment of 
<br>military ships along Iran's long coastline and other 
<br>resources.  Richier believes such a policy would send a 
<br>signal to exporters worldwide, but it would be too hard to 
<br>implement, and would likely only dissuade the honest 
<br>exporters.  When asked about French oil company Total and 
<br>pending U.S. congressional legislation, Richier replied Total 
<br>has not made new investments in Iran, although it is involved 
<br>in a buy-back arrangement and said sales of Total's refined 
<br>products in Iran are declining. 
<br> 
<br>IRAN: MFA SHARES ELYSEE'S VIEWS 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF) On January 14, Martin Briens, the Foreign 
<br>Ministry's DAS-equivalent for Non-Proliferation, largely 
<br>confirmed what Richier had said, but he provided additional 
<br>information.  Briens also highlighted French ambitions to get 
<br>a new UNSCR approved and implemented at the February 25 
<br>Foreign Ministers meeting.  However he said "tough and fast" 
<br>in the UNSC was unlikely, so we would probably have to settle 
<br>for fast.  A total arms embargo, which Russia had previously 
<br>opposed but China had not, would be a major victory, assuming 
<br>Russia actually supported it. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Briens asserted that the June election in Iran and 
<br>its aftermath had "changed the equation" within the EU with 
<br>respect to Iran.  He allowed that pending U.S. measures will 
<br>"also enter into the equation."  Several countries besides 
<br>France, including Spain, have come to the conclusion that it 
<br>is time to move from sanctions that specifically target 
<br>proliferation activities to ones that have a broader impact. 
<br>Given the delays in implementing the last UNSCR on Iran, 
<br>France and close partners had received EU approval to prepare 
<br>modalities of implementation "in parallel" to negotiations in 
<br>the UN.  The GOF has come to the view that the EU should take 
<br>"autonomous" measures that are not merely a magnified 
<br>application of UNSCRs, but it is still unclear how far EU 
<br>partners would go in this direction.  France has noted the 
<br>UKs adoption of a process to designate individual foreign 
<br>entities for sanctions and it is now considering doing the 
<br>same.  The GOF also believes that national governments can do 
<br>more through Financial Action Task Force decisions made by 
<br>the G8. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/NF) In addition to the potential package of sanctions 
<br>outlined by Richier (para 2), Briens said the GOF wants the 
<br>EU to: 
<br> 
<br>--Impose a "prior authorization" approach on all Iran Central 
<br>Bank transactions which would allow truly sovereign 
<br>operations by the Central Bank to be approved, but it would 
<br>allow greater scrutiny and control, and would slowdown the 
<br>processing of transactions. 
<br> 
<br>--Cast a wide net in banning/targeting IRGC persons and 
<br>entities. 
<br> 
<br>--Ban trade in equipment for internal repression and identify 
<br>people involved. 
<br> 
<br>Briens shared Richier's doubts on the efficacy of trying to 
<br>block refined petroleum products ("the bad guys will just get 
<br>rich") but the technology and parts for the oil and gas 
<br> 
<br>sectors, especially for refining should also be denied to 
<br>Iran.  Finally, on the issue of gaining China's 
<br>participation, he suggested emphasizing regional stability 
<br>and recruiting countries in the region to put pressure on 
<br>China as well. 
<br> 
<br>AFGHANISTAN: KARZAI NEEDS TO 
<br>FOLLOW UP ON INAUGURATION SPEECH 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) On January 14 Jasmine Zerinini, head of the GOF's 
<br>interagency Afghanistan-Pakistan cell, acknowledged that 
<br>public opposition in France to the troop presence in 
<br>Afghanistan has grown steadily over the past several years, 
<br>but that this has not resulted in calls for withdrawal or 
<br>even a significant change in strategy.  Regarding 
<br>coordination between the International Security Assistance 
<br>Forces, Zerinini said that there had been a great deal of 
<br>improvement, but that the approach was still too fragmented. 
<br>She said that France has recognized for the past year that 
<br>the forces stationed in the north of the country were unable 
<br>to handle the growing insurgency there.  General McChrystal 
<br>understands this, she added, but this has not translated into 
<br>action. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) On civilian assistance, Zerinini said U.S. and French 
<br>plans to deploy more civilians are unlikely to bear fruit, 
<br>because ultimately only the Afghans themselves can bring 
<br>effective development.  However, she opined, the Karzai 
<br>administration has not shown that it is capable of doing 
<br>this.  Although Karzai's inauguration speech in November was 
<br>a good first step, he has done nothing since then. 
<br>Therefore, she said, the London conference is coming far too 
<br>early - the goal of London was to renew our partnership with 
<br>Karzai, but this is difficult without a real roadmap for 
<br>progress from the Afghans. 
<br> 
<br>PAKISTAN: REINFORCING POLITICAL RELATIONS 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Zerinini said France is working to reinforce its 
<br>political relations with Pakistan, and was expecting 
<br>President Sarkozy to visit Pakistan "early in the second 
<br>quarter" of 2010.  The GOF does not want to return to a 
<br>relationship based on military equipment sales, as in the 
<br>1980s, and is instead focusing on counter terrorism in 
<br>addition to economic and trade links.  France is also trying 
<br>to support an EU-Pakistan dialogue, but she said Pakistan 
<br>makes it difficult by rejecting conditionality and attempting 
<br>to focus exclusively on economic issues.  Zerinini said the 
<br>Pakistani government is eager for trade concessions, but does 
<br>not want any political dialogue unless it is focused on 
<br>Kashmir. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) On the role of the Pakistani military, Zerinini said 
<br>General Kayani has "learned the lesson of Musharraf" and was 
<br>staying behind the scenes.  However, he is manipulating the 
<br>government and parliament, including to prevent change on 
<br>Pakistan's policy towards Federally Administered Tribal Areas 
<br>(FATA) along the Afghan border, and also to stir up 
<br>controversy regarding the Kerry-Lugar bill that ties 
<br>continued U.S. aid to increased civilian control of the 
<br>military.  Zerinini also argued that the west had missed its 
<br>opportunity to push the Pakistani military to crush the 
<br>Afghan Taliban taking refuge in Pakistan.  Citing Jalaladin 
<br>Haqqani as an example, Zerinini said in 2004 he had standing 
<br>as a leader in the jihadi community, but did not have the 
<br>organization to represent a significant military threat. 
<br>However, since then, large amounts of funding, predominately 
<br>from Gulf donors, have allowed Haqqani to create a network 
<br>that would be difficult for the Pakistani military to defeat, 
<br>even if it had the will to do so. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Zerinini said that bilateral measures alone to 
<br>strengthen civilian government were unlikely to be effective, 
<br>and that more coordination was needed among donors, 
<br>especially the United States.  She said the Group of Friends 
<br>of Democratic Pakistan, while imperfect, was designed to 
<br>transform Pakistan's political elite and give them more 
<br>leverage over the military.  However, Zerinini said it is not 
<br>being utilized.  She said the U.S. was making significant 
<br>efforts to help develop Pakistan's energy sector, but she 
<br>added "I have not seen any of this in the energy working 
<br>group of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan." 
<br> 
<br>THE FRENCH LEFTIST OPPOSITION 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) Staffdel members met opposition figures from the 
<br>French Parliament and Senate including Deputy Pierre 
<br>Moscovici (former Minister of European Affairs), Senator 
<br> 
<br>Jean-Pierre Chevenement (former Minister of Defense), Senator 
<br>Monique Cerisier ben Guiga (author of "Going Nuclear in the 
<br>Middle East"), and Deputy Jean-Michel Boucheron to learn 
<br>their views on Iran and the Middle East Peace Process.  With 
<br>respect to Iran, the group generally thought President 
<br>Sarkozy's tone had been too harsh and they supported giving 
<br>dialogue more time to bear fruit.  Moscovici was the most 
<br>alarmed at the prospect of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons 
<br>capability and he emphasized that he would not rule out any 
<br>means in dealing with it.  Boucheron and Cerisier ben Guiga 
<br>accepted the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran with equanimity 
<br>because they felt Iran was only seeking to enhance its power 
<br>rather than seeking to use nuclear weapons for hostile 
<br>purposes, while Boucheron was more concerned that the West's 
<br>focus on this issue was preventing movement on a host of 
<br>other issues where Iran might be helpful, including Iraq, 
<br>Afghanistan, Lebanon and Gaza.  Chevenement said he was 
<br>prepared to support sanctions on Iran, but he argued that 
<br>achieving progress towards peace between the Israelis and 
<br>Palestinians would be the most effective way of improving 
<br>relations with the Iranian regime. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) The group generally agreed that the USG was not 
<br>moving fast enough on the Middle East peace process. 
<br>Moscovici thought President Obama could both be a friend to 
<br>Israel, as well as being firm when necessary.  The opposition 
<br>members said the USG was not putting enough pressure on 
<br>Israel and that the temporary settlement freeze announced by 
<br>the Nentanyahu government is inadequate.  The group's 
<br>expectations for what the Obama Administration could 
<br>accomplish in the Middle East were high, and the perceived 
<br>absence of concrete results could lead to disappointment on 
<br>the French left. 
<br> 
<br>FRENCH ENERGY MAJOR TOTAL IN IRAN 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) Total's Vice President for International Relations 
<br>Hubert des Longchamps told staffdel members that the 
<br>company's current activities in Iran are legal.  Much in line 
<br>with recent statements (see reftel), Longchamps said Total's 
<br>focus is on recouping funds, in the form of cash payments, 
<br>from previous investments in the development of Iran's oil 
<br>and gas blocks.  He added that Total has no operational 
<br>responsibility in the South Pars field, and talks to finalize 
<br>buy-back arrangements to reimburse Total a "few hundred 
<br>thousand dollars" should have ended in 2008.  In addition, 
<br>Total provides limited technical services to the Iranians to 
<br>safeguard its remaining property interest.  Longchamps said 
<br>to walk away from these interests would only reward the 
<br>Tehran regime.  He added that Total from "time to time" sells 
<br>excess gasoline supplies to Iran when demand drops in Europe. 
<br> Longchamps did not quantify the value of this trade, but he 
<br>said if such deals carried a high political risk, Total was 
<br>willing to forego the business.  He reiterated that there is 
<br>no existing regulation prohibiting such sales, and if Total 
<br>withdrew entirely from the refined petroleum product markets, 
<br>the Indians, Koreans, and Chinese would remain active 
<br>players. 
<br> 
<br>18 (C) Like other energy companies, Total plans to return to 
<br>Iran in the future when the political situation improves, 
<br>Longchamps explained.  Therefore, Total offers financial 
<br>support to local communities to develop social and medical 
<br>projects.  These programs help maintain a dialogue with the 
<br>Iranian society and is a channel of communication that Total 
<br>wants to keep open.  He pointed out that Total has not 
<br>violated any U.N., EU or French laws.  Longchamps cautioned 
<br>the U.S. against imposing sanctions in Iran because they 
<br>would hurt typical Iranians without impacting the political 
<br>leadership.  When the Total Vice President asked the staffdel 
<br>if pending U.S. legislation could penalize energy companies 
<br>for selling refined petroleum to Iran, staffdel members 
<br>responded the legislation could possibly impact Total's 
<br>recent shale-gas investments in the U.S. 
<br> 
<br>THINK TANK: EFFECTIVENESS OF SANCTIONS 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) French officials are divided over the effectiveness 
<br>of sanctions as a response to Iran's continued pursuit of 
<br>nuclear enrichment, according to Bruno Tertrais, senior 
<br>researcher at the Foundation for Strategic Research (a think 
<br>tank focusing on international security and defense issues 
<br>whose main client is the GOF).  Tertrais told staffdel 
<br>members that he believes sanctions can be efficient, but he 
<br>noted the importance of defining the end goal.  He stated the 
<br>purpose of sanctions on Iran is not to stop the nuclear 
<br>program immediately but to exert pressure on the regime and 
<br>to elicit a gradual change.  He listed the successful use of 
<br>sanctions in the past on four different countries -- South 
<br> 
<br>Africa, Libya, Iraq, and North Korea -- the fact that 
<br>sanctions on Iran have put a strain on its imports, and the 
<br>accelerated debate within Iranian leadership as factors that 
<br>back the argument that sanctions can be effective.  He 
<br>caveated his statements throughout the meeting by saying 
<br>sanctions would be ineffective if nothing was done to address 
<br>the black market and business circuits to Dubai.  Regarding 
<br>the GOF's stance on sanctions, Tertrais noted that the Office 
<br>of the Presidency (Elysee) was more supportive of further 
<br>sanctions and mindful of strategic issues than the MFA, which 
<br>tended to take a regional approach and be more dovish. 
<br>Tetrais stated that the history of the late 1980s showed that 
<br>the more pressure foreign governments placed on the Tehran 
<br>regime, the more the Iranians backed down. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) Embassy comment: Staffdel Kessler's engagement with a 
<br>broad audience on these issues helped advance our mutual 
<br>understanding of the challenges and strategies to advance our 
<br>common interests in Iran and Afghanistan, and on the 
<br>effectiveness of sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (U) Staffdel Kessler did not clear this cable.
