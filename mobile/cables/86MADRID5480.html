<br>SUBJECT:  QADHAFI RETALIATES AGAINST SPANISH EXPULSIONS 
<br> 
<br>REF:  A) MADRID 5426, B) MADRID 5425, C) MADRID 5418 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) LIBYA MAY 12 RESPONDED TO FRIDAY'S EXPULSION OF 
<br>ITS CONSUL GENERAL, CHARGED WITH PASSING FUNDS TO 
<br>A SPANISH ARMY COLONEL ON THE ANTI-DEMOCRATIC RIGHT, 
<br>BY PNG'ING THE SPANISH COMMERCIAL AND CULTURAL 
<br>COUNSELORS IN TRIPOLI.  MFA'S SUBDIRECTOR GENERAL FOR 
<br>NORTH AFRICA TELLS US THAT THE GOS WILL NOT RETALIATE 
<br>SPECIFICALLY FOR THESE EXPULSIONS; AS INVESTIGATIONS 
<br>CONTINUE INTO THE LIBYAN ACTIVITIES HERE, HOWEVER, 
<br>MORE EXPULSIONS ARE QUITE POSSIBLE. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (U) AFTER THIS MESSAGE WAS DRAFTED, WE RECEIVED 
<br>A WIRE SERVICE REPORT QUOTING INTERIOR MINISTER 
<br>BARRIONUEVO SAYING THAT SPAIN DID NOT PLAN ADDITIONAL 
<br>LIBYAN EXPULSIONS. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) COMMENT:  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHERE THIS SERIES 
<br>OF EXPULSIONS AND REPRISALS IS GOING TO TAKE SPANISH- 
<br>LIBYAN RELATIONS.  THE GOS IS DRIVEN BY TWO MUTUALLY- 
<br>EXCLUSIVE DESIRES.  ON THE ONE HAND, IN THIS ELECTORAL 
<br>PERIOD IT WANTS TO DISCREDIT THE FAR RIGHT (WHICH IT 
<br>HAS DONE BY PUBLICIZING THE COLONEL'S CONNECTION TO 
<br>QADHAFI - REF C), AND SHOW IT IS 
<br>EFFECTIVE AGAINST TERRORISM (WHICH IT DID 
<br>BY BAGGING THE 10-MAN "CALL OF JESUS CHRIST" GROUP - 
<br>REF A).  AT THE SAME TIME THE GOS WANTS TO AVOID 
<br>BECOMING A PRINCIPAL TARGET FOR QADHAFI BY PERSERVING 
<br>AS MUCH OF A RELATIONSHIP AS POSSIBLE.  FOREIGN 
<br>MINISTER ORDONEZ     PLAYED  TO THE SECOND LINE THIS 
<br>WEEKEND WHEN HE REFUSED TO COMMENT ON LIBYAN ACTIVITIES 
<br>HERE, SAYING "I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY STATEMENT WHICH 
<br>MIGHT AGGRAVATE A STATE OF RELATIONS WHICH IS PASSING 
<br>THROUGH A DELICATE MOMENT."  WE UNDERSTAND FROM OUR 
<br>MFA SOURCE THAT SENIOR MINISTRY OFFICIALS MET TODAY 
<br>TO DECIDE HOW TO REACT TO LIBYA'S RETALIATION 
<br>(WHICH LEAVES THE GOS EMBASSY IN TRIPOLI WITH ONLY 
<br>3 DIPLOMATS).  THE DECISION TO DO NOTHING IS 
<br>CONSISTENT WITH THE MINISTRY'S LINE -- TAKEN PUBLICLY 
<br>THIS WEEKEND -- THAT IT DOES NOT WANT TO SEVER 
<br>RELATIONS WITH TRIPOLI.  THIS STRATEGY IS ONLY POSSIBLE 
<br>IF QADHAFI PLAYS ALONG.
