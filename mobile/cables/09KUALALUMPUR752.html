<br>SUBJECT: BANK MELLAT/FEEB DEMARCH DELIVERED TO BANK NEGARA
<br>
<br>REF: A. SECSTATE 90063
<br>B KUALA LUMPUR 739
<br>
<br>Classified By: Economic Counselor Matthew J. Matthews, reason 1.4
<br>(b and d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Econcouns delivered ref A demarche on FEEB xxxxxxxxxxxx emphasized
<br>that BN and LOFSA took their supervisory role seriously, and
<br>that Malaysia approved the FEEB license and would allow it to
<br>operate as long as there was no evidence that FEEB was in
<br>contravention of any relevant law and was not sanctioned by
<br>the UN. In an effort to establish that BN did in fact take
<br>its supervisory role seriously, Zamaini had his LOFSA Deputy
<br>Director read the four restrictions which LOFSA placed on the
<br>FEEB license and noted that FEEB had only processed one
<br>transaction in its first six months of operation. Econcouns
<br>reiterated core USG points several times, emphasizing that
<br>FEEB represented substantial reputational risk to Malaysia
<br>and that revocation of the license would be the prudent thing
<br>to do. xxxxxxxxxxxx made it clear that BN did not intend to revoke
<br>FEEB,s license unless the UN decided to sanction FEEB or
<br>proof was provided that activity by FEEB that contravened
<br>Malaysia,s laws. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Econ Counselor Matthews, accompanied by Econoff and
<br>visiting Embassy Singapore Treasury Attache Seth Bleiweis,
<br>conveyed reftel (a) points and non-paper on First East Export
<br>Bank (FEEB) to Bank Negara (BN) Deputy Governor Zamani, BN
<br>Legal Director Jeremy Lee, Labuan Offshore Financial Services
<br>Authority (LOFSA) Deputy Governor Danial Mah Abdullah, and
<br>others on September 10. This follows on delivery of demarche
<br>and non-paper to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and PM,s
<br>office on September 4 (Ref B). Econcouns highlighted to
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx the key points of the non-paper for xxxxxxxxxxxx, noting
<br>specifically the new information on Bank Mellat proliferation
<br>finance activities and warned that if the GOM did not commit
<br>to revoking the FEEB license the U.S. would proceed with
<br>sanctioning FEEB under U.S. law.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) xxxxxxxxxxxx responded that BN performed significant due
<br>diligence and gave great consideration prior to allowing
<br>LOFSA to issue the FEEB license. To counter possible
<br>proliferation activities, LOFSA issued the FEEB license with
<br>four significant operating conditions, the first conditioned
<br>bank license ever issued in Malaysia, xxxxxxxxxxxx said. LOFSA,s
<br>Abdullah orally read out the conditions which included: FEEB
<br>may not do business with any UN sanctioned entity; FEEB is
<br>required to adhere to all Malaysian anti-money laundering and
<br>anti-terror financing laws; FEEB must comply with all LOFSA
<br>regulations and directives; and FEEB shareholders may not be
<br>sanctioned by the UN. Breach of any of the listed
<br>conditions, he noted, would be cause for immediate license
<br>revocation. Abdullah also said that Bank Melli and Bank
<br>Saderat had previously applied for bank licenses from LOFSA,
<br>but were denied.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Lee shared BN concerns that if BN were to revoke the
<br>FEEB license it would trigger law suits against the GOM by
<br>FEEB shareholders. He continued that after repeated BN
<br>requests, the USG has yet to provide any concrete or specific
<br>evidence of FEEB or Bank Mellat wrongdoing that could be used
<br>in court by the GOM to defend a suit against BN for wrongful
<br>action against FEEB. xxxxxxxxxxxx added that U.S. &suspicions8
<br>were not always accurate. Lee also queried on U.S.
<br>designation actions on other Bank Mellat foreign subsidiaries
<br>in Seoul, London, Ankara and other locations and asked why
<br>Malaysia was being singled out for immediate action.
<br>Abdullah noted that BN recently inspected FEEB and found the
<br>bank had consummated only one Euro 400,000 letter of credit
<br>for the import of oil and gas-related equipment from Iran in
<br>its first six months of operation. BN officials argued that
<br>they could supervise a low-activity Bank Mellat subsidiary as
<br>well as those other countries where the US is not preparing
<br>to implement sanctions.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Econcouns countered that the U.S. will unilaterally
<br>designate FEEB in order to protect our financial system and
<br>warn other financial institutions away from a bank owned by
<br>what we believe is a provider of financing for proliferation
<br>items. He added that Iran had used its banks, such as
<br>Saderat and Melli, to finance proliferation items from other
<br>important trading partners and those banks are now
<br>sanctioned. Our information indicates Iran is now using
<br>Mellat for the same purpose. FEEB could be next, potentially
<br>causing significant embarrassment to Malaysia. Econcouns
<br>told xxxxxxxxxxxx that the US was offering BN pre-notification and
<br>
<br>Kuala lump 00000752 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>the release of our intelligence as a good faith gesture so
<br>that the GOM could prudently manage the risks to Malaysia,s
<br>financial system and its reputation in the global financial
<br>market by revoking FEEB,s license prior to a proliferation
<br>finance incident.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) xxxxxxxxxxxx acknowledged the importance of this issue to
<br>the United States, but gave no indication that the GOM would
<br>revoke FEEB,s license. Econcouns nevertheless encouraged
<br>prompt revocation action by BN.
