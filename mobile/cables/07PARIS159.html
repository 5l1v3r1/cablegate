<br>SUBJECT: FRANCE SEEKS EU COVER ON IRAN CIVIL SOCIETY 
<br> 
<br>REF: STATE 2659 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt, 
<br>reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Poloff delivered reftel demarche on January 16 to MFA 
<br>Iran Desk Officer Arnaud Pescheux, who indicated that France 
<br>had not budgeted any funds for democracy promotion in Iran. 
<br>"If we were to do something, it would undoubtedly be via 
<br>Brussels," Pescheux said.  He noted that France "anticipated 
<br>supporting" a proposal by Javier Solana for the EU to expand 
<br>its own Farsi broadcasting capabilities, although he said 
<br>that details of that proposal have yet to be worked out. 
<br>While the MFA does not currently partner with any French NGOs 
<br>operating in Iran, in the past a few NGOs (e.g., Reporters 
<br>Without Borders) had brought members of Iranian civil society 
<br>to France to participate in programs. 
<br> 
<br>French Envoy to Tehran 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Citing a press report in the January 16 edition of Le 
<br>Monde, Poloff asked whether it was true that France planned 
<br>to send a presidential envoy to Tehran in the near future. 
<br>Choosing his words with care, Pescheux said that the Le Monde 
<br>report was "not false" but stressed that a final decision had 
<br>not yet been taken.  Pescheux said that the envoy would not 
<br>engage on the nuclear file but would instead discuss regional 
<br>issues and, in particular, would seek to "find a solution on 
<br>Lebanon." 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Poloff said he was shocked that France, which had 
<br>steadfastly rejected entreaties to negotiate Lebanon's future 
<br>with the Syrian regime, apparently found the prospect of 
<br>conducting similar negotiations with Tehran less 
<br>objectionable.  Had the Iranians given the French some 
<br>indication that they would be more forthcoming than Damascus? 
<br> No, Pescheux admitted, the Iranians had not tipped their 
<br>hand; they had merely indicated that they were willing to 
<br>talk. 
<br> 
<br>Supreme Leader Still on Top 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Turning to the results of Iran's recent elections, 
<br>Pescheux indicated that the French were pleasantly surprised 
<br>by the outcome (immediately prior to the election, their 
<br>reporting from Tehran suggested that President Ahmadinejad's 
<br>supporters were poised to make significant gains in the 
<br>Assembly of Experts).  The Quai's interpretation of the 
<br>election results is that the axis between Supreme Leader 
<br>Khamenei and former President Rafsanjani (i.e., the 
<br>traditional conservatives) has been strengthened, with 
<br>Khamenei remaining the supreme arbiter of Iran's political 
<br>balance of power.  In an aside, Pescheux claimed that 
<br>notwithstanding the French diplomatic presence in Tehran, the 
<br>MFA has virtually no insight into the inner workings of the 
<br>Pasdaran.
