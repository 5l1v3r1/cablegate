<br>¶1. (C/NF) Summary: In a July 2 meeting with Eric 
<br>Chevallier, Special Advisor to the Foreign Affairs Minister, 
<br>Ambassador Dan Fried, Special Envoy for Closure of the 
<br>Guantanamo Detention Facility (S/GC), summarized the results 
<br>of his efforts to negotiate the resettlement of Guantanamo 
<br>detainees and thanked France for agreeing to consider six new 
<br>detainee files. Chevallier stressed that France would review 
<br>the cases in a positive light. Speaking on instruction, he 
<br>also said that France would not be able to respond until more 
<br>is known about the attitude of Congress toward accepting 
<br>detainees on U.S. soil. Chevallier agreed that a favorable 
<br>decision allowing the resettlement of Guantanamo detainees in 
<br>the United States is not a "pre-condition" but characterized 
<br>it as extremely important and not far from being a 
<br>pre-condition. He also noted that establishing a good 
<br>precedent with Schengen members by providing France with 
<br>information to share on the previously transferred detainee 
<br>Boumediene would likely assist the process for obtaining 
<br>Schengen visas in other detainee resettlements in Europe. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Chevallier was joined by Deputy Director of the 
<br>Foreign Minister's Office, Michele Boccoz; MFA Deputy 
<br>Director for the Office of Transnational Threats, Martin 
<br>Julliard; MFA Assistant secretary-equivalent for 
<br>International Organizations, Sylvie Bermann; Deputy Assistant 
<br>secretary-equivalent for Human Rights, Jacques Pellet; Deputy 
<br>Director for the North Americas Office, Bernard 
<br>Regnauld-Fabre; and External Relations for the European Union 
<br>desk officer, Fatih Akcal. Charge Pekala, Pol/Min Counselor 
<br>and note taker also attended. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Six New Detainee Files: Potential Impact of U.S. Decisions 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) S/E Fried introduced the dossiers of six 
<br>detainees that the U.S. would like France to consider taking, 
<br>pointing out that several of them have court-ordered releases 
<br>and noting that we have presented some of the cases to other 
<br>European governments. Chevallier expressed appreciation for 
<br>the new information and assured Fried that, following the 
<br>Obama-Sarkozy meeting in June and the resettlement in May of 
<br>Algerian Lakdar Boumediene, France will look at the files in 
<br>a positive light. However, speaking on instruction, he 
<br>cautioned that France will not be able to provide an answer 
<br>until more is known about the attitude of Congress toward 
<br>accepting some of the detainees on U.S. soil. A positive 
<br>decision by Congress, Chevallier continued, would boost the 
<br>prospects for selling detainee resettlement to the French 
<br>public and to other European countries. When pressed by 
<br>Fried, Chevallier responded that the congressional decision 
<br>is not a "pre-condition," but also said "it is not far from 
<br>that." He emphasized that the U.S. decision "is part of 
<br>France,s political assessment" and "is extremely important" 
<br>to France,s final decision. At the same time, Chevallier 
<br>confirmed that France would not intervene negatively in U.S. 
<br>discussions with other countries, for example, Spain, Italy, 
<br>and Portugal, that are moving ahead with resettlement. In 
<br>closing discussions on the files,Fried suggested French 
<br>officials visit Guantanamo to interview the detainees and 
<br>talk to the defense lawyers to inform their decision and aid 
<br>in the selection of future candidates and to make any 
<br>requests for further information through intelligence liaison. 
<br>
<br>Request to Share Boumediene's File with Schengen Partners 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) Chevallier confirmed that Schengen partner states 
<br>now have to share the files of detainees with their Schengen 
<br>partners per the agreed EU framework. If no state opposes, a 
<br>Schengen visa will be issued; however, if one or more partner 
<br>states oppose, then only a national visa can be granted. 
<br>Refusal to grant a Schengen visa would also have an impact on 
<br>the social services and type of residence status offered to 
<br>former detainees. Chevallier would like Boumediene to be the 
<br>first test case, as he is a lower risk detainee. Fried 
<br>agreed to provide a revised file that can be shared with EU 
<br>partners. Chevallier regretted the EU decision to put this 
<br>issue under the purview of Interior Ministers, saying it 
<br>would have been easier to manage under Foreign Ministers. 
<br>Fried concluded his discussion with 
<br>Chevallier by noting that U.S. procedures in detainee 
<br>transfers have changed somewhat. New congressional 
<br>legislation now requires notification of transfer 15 days in 
<br>advance and notification of the transfer arrangements. The 
<br>U.S. plans to meet this requirement in the future through an 
<br>exchange of diplomatic notes. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) Chevallier,s expert on this issue, Martin 
<br>Julliard, asked about the financial payments the U.S. is 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000933 002.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>providing to Bermuda and Palau upon their acceptance of the 
<br>Uighur detainees. Fried clarified that U.S. funds are 
<br>intended to cover reimbursable expenses only and are minimal. 
<br>Julliard said that his office has been monitoring French 
<br>public opinion on the resettlement of Boumediene and cited 
<br>the use of tax money for detainee resettlement as one of the 
<br>top three concerns. Fried made no commitment, but 
<br>said he would be willing to discuss this further if it 
<br>becomes necessary symbolically for France. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) Comment: French authorities remain proud of their 
<br>lead role in opening the way to resettlement of some 
<br>detainees in Europe and are committed to looking favorably at 
<br>the six new detainee files. However, a U.S. decision to 
<br>accept or reject taking detainees on U.S. soil is clearly 
<br>part of the calculation as they also assess French domestic 
<br>reaction to resettlement.
