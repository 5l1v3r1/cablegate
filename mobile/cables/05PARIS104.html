<br>SUBJECT: GTMO AND DJAMEL BEGHAL TRIAL UPDATES 
<br>
<br>REF: A. PARIS 8729 
<br>¶B. PARIS 8918 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt for reaso 
<br>ns 1.4 b and d. 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: The investigation against four former GTMO 
<br>detainees (reftels A and B) appears to be proceeding well; 
<br>all appeals for pre-trial release have been denied and the 
<br>investigating judges feel confident that the trial, likely to 
<br>begin this summer, will result in conviction. However, in a 
<br>related action, France's highest appeals court for criminal 
<br>matters overturned two previous courts' decisions and 
<br>referred, to the Paris Court of Appeals for action, a 
<br>complaint brought by the families of two ex-GTMO detainees 
<br>requesting an investigation into their detention. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary continued: Separately, the public trial 
<br>against suspected terrorist Djamel Beghal and five 
<br>accomplices accused of plotting to attack US interests in 
<br>France, including an attack against the Embassy, began 
<br>January 3. Thus far, the trial has been highlighted by the 
<br>defiance of the defendants during questioning. Post will 
<br>continue to report on these cases, as well as that of Mohamed 
<br>al-Jundi, the Syrian driver of the two French journalists 
<br>kidnapped in Iraq (septel). Al-Jundi filed suit against U.S. 
<br>forces alleging torture while in U.S. custody following his 
<br>liberation from insurgent captivity. End summary. 
<br>
<br>EX-GTMO DETAINEES 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) The ongoing investigation against the four ex-GTMO 
<br>detainees currently in French custody is progressing well and 
<br>the trial is likely to begin this summer. Thus far, all 
<br>appeals by defense attorneys for the release of their clients 
<br>from pre-trial detention have been rejected. A recent 
<br>defense appeal to obtain transcripts from alleged 
<br>interrogations by French authorities while the detainees were 
<br>still at GTMO was similarly denied. The anti-terrorism 
<br>judges investigating the case communicate regularly with 
<br>Post, and they are confident the evidence obtained by French 
<br>authorities since the four were remanded to French custody is 
<br>overwhelming. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) France's highest appeals court, the Cour de 
<br>Cassation, ruled January 4 that the Paris Court of Appeals 
<br>would have to address a complaint filed by the families of 
<br>two former GTMO detainees seeking a criminal investigation 
<br>into certain unknown and unnamed persons (undoubtedly U.S. 
<br>officials) for the illegal detention of the two in 
<br>Guantanamo. The complaint had initially been filed in 2002 
<br>and was dismissed by a judge in Lyon. The Lyon Court of 
<br>Appeals upheld this initial decision in 2003, arguing that 
<br>that the detention could not be investigated because it was 
<br>the result of an American military operation covered by a 
<br>unanimously adopted UN resolution. However, yesterday's 
<br>appeal court decision indicated that the complaint could not 
<br>be dismissed without investigating whether there was evidence 
<br>related to the complaint that could be applicable under 
<br>French law. The complaint is now remanded to the Paris Court 
<br>of Appeals, which technically could rule with the Lyon 
<br>decisions, but will likely have to open an investigation 
<br>itself or designate a judge to investigate the complaint. 
<br>Media reports indicate that requests for U.S. judicial 
<br>explanations are likely. It is not yet clear how this 
<br>complaint could affect the French investigation against the 
<br>detainees. Post will continue to follow the developments of 
<br>this case closely. 
<br>
<br>DJAMEL BEGHAL TRIAL 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The trial of six men suspected of plotting in Afghani 
<br>terror training camps to target U.S. interests in France -- 
<br>specifically, to bomb the US Embassy in Paris in 2001 -- 
<br>began January 3. The proceedings have thus far been 
<br>dominated by combative responses from the defendants. 
<br>Suspected cell leader Djamel Beghal, a 39-year-old 
<br>Algerian-born French citizen who was arrested in the UAE in 
<br>July 2001 after leaving Afghanistan, told authorities in 
<br>Dubai that he was the head of an al-Qaeda-linked cell intent 
<br>on attacking US interests in France, including the U.S. 
<br>Embassy in Paris; however, Beghal later retracted his 
<br>confession and told the chief judge in the trial that he had 
<br>given it under "methodical torture." In Beghal's testimony 
<br>he referred to himself in the third person, responded to the 
<br>judge's questions with questions of his own, referred at one 
<br>point to the proceedings as an "Inquisition court," and 
<br>refused to explain his reasons for visiting Afghanistan. 
<br>Kamel Daoudi, arrested in Britain and extradited to France in 
<br>September 2001, posed multiple definitions for the term 
<br>"jihadist" and proclaimed his innocence as a terrorist, 
<br>despite being arrested in possession of texts by Ayman al 
<br>Zawahiri and other Islamic extremists, claiming that "when 
<br>someone reads 'Das Kapital,' he is not necessarily a 
<br>Marxist." French authorities allege that Beghal admitted in 
<br>questioning that Abu Zubaydah gave the order to attack U.S. 
<br>interests in an Afghani terror camp in March 2001; both 
<br>Beghal and Daoudi deny having met Zubaydah. The trial is 
<br>expected to last seven weeks, and if convicted, the six 
<br>defendants face up to 10 years in prison.
