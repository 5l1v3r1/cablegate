<br> 
<br>¶1. (C//NF) SUMMARY:  Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez 
<br>Rubalcaba will meet senior officials from the DHS, DOJ, FBI, 
<br>CIA, ODNI, NCTC, and possibly the NSC, during his June 23-25 
<br>visit to Washington, DC.  USG interlocutors will find that 
<br>Rubalcaba - who has wide-ranging responsibilities on 
<br>security, law enforcement and intelligence issues - is very 
<br>capable and serious but also charming.  A career politician, 
<br>Rubalcaba is arguably the most impressive member of Spanish 
<br>President Zapatero's cabinet and a very useful and powerful 
<br>ally to have in the Zapatero Administration.  His influence 
<br>exceeds the formal parameters of his Ministry.  Embassy 
<br>Madrid judges the bilateral law enforcement relationship to 
<br>be excellent, while the bilateral CT relationship is good but 
<br>could be better.  Rubalcaba is interested in signing either 
<br>several bilateral accords or (if the accords cannot be ironed 
<br>out in time) political declarations of intent to do so in the 
<br>near future.  The Minister has an extensive agenda - 
<br>including counter-terrorism (CT), law enforcement, and 
<br>intelligence issues - he wishes to discuss with US officials. 
<br> While the focus of this trip will be on discussing bilateral 
<br>issues, Rubalcaba also will address GOS interest in increased 
<br>collaboration on justice and home affairs issues during 
<br>Spain's upcoming stint as President of the European Union 
<br>(EU) during the first half of 2010.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>//US-SPAIN RELATIONS// 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C//NF) U.S.-Spain relations are strong and based on 
<br>shared global interests.  Spain is an important friend and 
<br>ally and we value its cooperation against terrorism and a 
<br>range of other security issues.  Since the US presidential 
<br>election in November, a strong atmosphere of goodwill has 
<br>emerged in Spain for closer bilateral  cooperation.  As a 
<br>gesture of this goodwill, the GOS presently is considering 
<br>accepting some of the detainees currently held at Guantanamo 
<br>(GTMO, see Ref A).  XXXXXXXXXXXX.  Spain also allows us the use of two military bases that are critical transit points between the U.S. and Iraq and Afghanistan.  Recent irritants in bilateral 
<br>relations, however, are the efforts by the Spanish judiciary 
<br>- invoking "universal jurisdiction" - to indict former USG 
<br>officials for their allegedly involvement in torture at GTMO. 
<br>(See Ref C). 
<br> 
<br>//RUBALCABA AND HIS MINISTRY// 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C//NF) A member of parliament since 1996, Rubalcaba is a 
<br>three-time Minister who in mid-2008 also served a brief stint 
<br>as acting Defense Minister.  He is known for his 
<br>intelligence, discretion, hard work, and mastery of detail, 
<br>as well as his negotiating prowess.  Rubalcaba was the 
<br>Socialist party's longtime pointman on CT issues before 
<br>Zapatero named him Interior Minister in early 2006.  He is 
<br>one of two or three individuals whom Zapatero often consults 
<br>before making big decisions, and not only on issues within 
<br>Rubalcaba's portfolio.  A senior official within the 
<br> 
<br>MADRID 00000551  002.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br>Socialist party with a reputation for getting things done, 
<br>Rubalcaba excels at putting out fires and is a valued contact 
<br>of the Embassy, which finds him accessible and effective in 
<br>getting things done for us despite his busy portfolio.  This 
<br>will be Rubalcaba's first meeting with most of his USG 
<br>interlocutors, although he first met DHS Secretary Napolitano 
<br>in Berlin for the G6 1 meeting on March 15.  The Minister 
<br>speaks English but prefers to have an interpreter present for 
<br>some of the more technical aspects of his official meetings. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C//NF) The Ministry of Interior (MOI) oversees the 
<br>Spanish National Police (SNP) and the paramilitary Civil 
<br>Guard (GC).  The MOI is a key cabinet post, as Spain 
<br>confronts both the domestic terrorist group Basque Fatherland 
<br>and Liberty (ETA) and radical Islamist terrorists and 
<br>sympathizers.  Spain's 40-year battle against ETA has given 
<br>its security forces - and their intelligence wings - 
<br>considerable CT expertise, although the GOS continues to 
<br>adapt its methods to combating decentralized radical 
<br>Islamists.  Spain also faces a confluence of organized crime 
<br>syndicates involved in the contraband of narcotics and other 
<br>drugs, human trafficking and illegal immigration, money 
<br>laundering and credit card fraud, and document falsification. 
<br> Meanwhile, the SNP and GC increasingly are expanding their 
<br>representation overseas as attaches in Embassies.  Embassy 
<br>Madrid recommends that USG interlocutors press Rubalcaba on 
<br>sending GC and/or SNP personnel to help train security forces 
<br>in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C//NF)  We believe Rubalcaba fully understands the extent 
<br>of the lack of inter-agency cooperation between the SNP and 
<br>the GC, as well as stovepipe problems between them and 
<br>Spain's National Intelligence Center (CNI).  He has 
<br>overhauled the MOI to achieve greater inter-agency 
<br>efficiencies.  In 2006 he created an Organized Crime 
<br>Intelligence Center (CICO) and in 2007 he created a National 
<br>Center of Critical Infrastructure Protection (CNPIC).  The 
<br>director of Spain's National Center for Counter-Terrorism 
<br>Coordination (CNCA, roughly equivalent to the NCTC) reports 
<br>to Rubalcaba.  XXXXXXXXXXXXX  Rubalcaba has overseen a 
<br>very forward-leaning CT strategy against both radical 
<br>Islamists and - following the late 2006 car-bombing of the 
<br>Madrid airport, which ended its unilaterally declared 
<br>cease-fire - ETA.  The GOS prides itself that its 
<br>preventative justice approach, disrupting terrorist cells 
<br>before they become operational, has resulted in no deaths at 
<br>the hands of radical Islamists since 2004.  Rubalcaba 
<br>realizes he needs the USG on CT issues and therefore he has 
<br>been cooperative with U.S. interlocutors on that topic. 
<br> 
<br>//FOUR PROSPECTIVE BILATERAL ACCORDS// 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C//NF) Rubalcaba's staff tells us he hopes to sign up to 
<br>four accords during his visit: 
<br> 
<br>I) A US-proposed agreement on Preventing and Combating 
<br>Serious Crime (PCSC), as discussed in Ref E. 
<br> 
<br>II) An agreement on Cooperation in Science & Technology for 
<br>Homeland Security Matters, using the existing US-Mexico 
<br>agreement as a template. 
<br> 
<br>III)  An MOU formalizing ongoing cooperation on the DHS's 
<br>Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) at Madrid's Barajas 
<br>Airport, where a successful pilot program recently was 
<br>carried out. 
<br> 
<br>IV) An MOU to strengthen bilateral cooperation and reinforce 
<br>efforts to locate fugitives. 
<br> 
<br>//PROSPECTIVE ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION PER MEETING// 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C//NF) Rubalcaba hopes to sign the above accords with the 
<br>DHS Secretary, with whom he also will discuss protecting 
<br>critical infrastructure and combating counterfeit money.  He 
<br>will discuss ETA, border control issues, and the CSI.  He 
<br>also will suggest the creation of an alert system regarding 
<br>the theft of nuclear materials by terrorists.  Finally, he 
<br> 
<br>MADRID 00000551  003.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>will propose an exchange of liaison personnel to have 
<br>officials present in each others' headquarters.  On a 
<br>multilateral issues, Rubalcaba will address GOS plans to 
<br>"revitalize" the US-EU transatlantic partnership during 
<br>Spain's EU Presidency.  This may include an embryonic idea 
<br>for a joint US-EU declaration on the fight against terrorism 
<br>to be signed in Madrid on March 11, 2010, the sixth 
<br>anniversary of the Madrid train bombings. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C//NF) With the Attorney General and FBI Director, 
<br>Rubalcaba will discuss the prospective accord on fugitives 
<br>(See above).  He also wants to discuss the CODIS database, 
<br>cybercrime issues, cooperation regarding ETA, a proposal to 
<br>intensify cooperation with the DEA, and efforts to fight 
<br>organized crime and money laundering.  He also will raise the 
<br>GTMO detainee issue.  Rubalcaba will have a role in deciding 
<br>the GOS decision on the GTMO, based on security concerns and 
<br>freedom of movement issues.  Post recommends that Rubalcaba 
<br>would be a logical person with whom to press the message that 
<br>the various universal jurisdiction cases against former USG 
<br>officials are not helpful. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C//NF) Embassy Madrid is sending via other channels the 
<br>proposed agenda for Rubalcaba's meetings with the DNI, CIA 
<br>and NCTC. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C//NF) The GOS has asked for an appointment with the 
<br>U.S. National Security Adviser, with whom Rubalcaba would 
<br>like to discuss the US-EU transatlantic agenda, a declaration 
<br>of CT principles (See Para 9), and the issue of Guantanamo 
<br>detainees.  The Minister also would like to address radical 
<br>Islamic terrorism in the Af/Pak region and in the Sahel. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) We suggest Washington interlocutors thank Rubalcaba 
<br>for the excellent anti-organized crime and counter-narcotics 
<br>relationships we enjoy in Spain and urge that we work jointly 
<br>to find ways to improve the already good CT relationship. 
<br>DOJ in particular will wish to thank him for Spain's 
<br>assistance in extraditing arms trafficker Monzer al-Kassar in 
<br>¶2008.
