<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Tom Kelly, DCM, DOS, EXEC; REASON: 1.4(B), (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Over the past six weeks, we have held several
<br>conversations with President Fernandez de Kirchner's first two
<br>Cabinet Chiefs, Alberto Fernandez and Sergio Massa. Both believe
<br>that the Kirchners, despite their recent political successes,
<br>cannot win re-election in 2011. They disagree on whom is next in
<br>line: Fernandez thinks that the next President will be Vice
<br>President Julio Cobos, while Massa believes that Senator Carlos
<br>Reutemann will prevail. Both ex-Cabinet chiefs are (separately)
<br>plotting their futures in a post-Kirchner political landscape.
<br>Massa expanded on earlier comments to us (ref a) on life with the
<br>Kirchners, describing ex-president Nestor Kirchner as a "monster"
<br>and a "psychopath." End Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) We have had several conversations with the first two
<br>Cabinet Chiefs of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (CFK), Alberto
<br>Fernandez and Sergio Massa. The Ambassador had an introductory
<br>meeting with Alberto Fernandez, who served as Cabinet Chief in both
<br>Nestor and CFK's administrations, on October 28, and DCM lunched
<br>with Fernandez on October 2. The Ambassador and DCM also had
<br>dinner with CFK's second cabinet chief Sergio Massa and his wife,
<br>city councilor-elect Malena Galmarini, at the home of Massa's
<br>former Casa Rosada aide, businessman Jorge O'Reilly, on November
<br>¶12. In each of these conversations, the two prominent Peronists,
<br>who during their tenures in the Casa Rosada worked every day with
<br>the Kirchners to run the Argentine government, were quite frank in
<br>expressing their estrangement from the Kirchners and their
<br>pessimism about the first couple's political prospects.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Alberto and Massa Agree: Kirchners Will Lose in 2011
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Massa said that the Kirchners have no chance to capture the
<br>presidency in 2011. When asked to estimate their chances, Massa
<br>replied, "zero." He also discounted the view that the Kirchners
<br>would extend their rule through Chavez-style governance. Massa
<br>said that, for all of its problems, Argentina is not Venezuela.
<br>Its society remained too literate, too middle class, and too
<br>"temperate," and its economy is far more complex and diverse than
<br>Venezuela's oil monoculture. Argentina, he said, would not abide
<br>the Kirchner's attempts to consolidate power through more
<br>autocratic rule. The result of their hardball tactics after the
<br>midterm elections, he argued, was even more negative ratings in the
<br>polls.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Fernandez predicted that Nestor would be the Kirchners'
<br>presidential candidate in 2011. He claimed that Nestor has a
<br>better reputation for competence than CFK. Fernandez told the DCM
<br>that his soundings on CFK's potential run for re-election
<br>invariably provoked reactions of alarm and exasperation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) But Nestor cannot possibly win, continued Fernandez,
<br>comparing the former president to Carlos Menem circa 1999. He said
<br>that, like Menem ten years ago, Kirchner could hope for no more
<br>than 20 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential
<br>election. These voters, he continued, are Kirchner
<br>"fundamentalists" whose votes reflect ideological affinity or
<br>association with the various political machines (controlled by
<br>piqueteros, labor leaders, etc.) that remain loyal to the Kirchner
<br>project. Fernandez said that, because Kirchner at this point in
<br>his political career has zero attraction to independent voters, he
<br>could expect to win no more votes in the second round of elections
<br>than he would in the first. Fernandez predicted that Nestor would
<br>run and CFK would increasingly govern from the Left, as that "is
<br>the only constituency that remains to them." He added, though,
<br>that such a strategy was doomed to fail -- "the Left on its own
<br>can't elect anyone to the Presidency in this country," he said.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Alberto and Massa Disagree on Next President
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Massa identified Santa Fe Senator Carlos Reutemann as the
<br>likely presidential winner in 2011. He said that Reutemann's
<br>strategy of lying low was prudent, not a blunder or sign of
<br>indecision as often portrayed in the press. With Reutemann quiet,
<br>the Kirchner machine was focused on pummeling Vice President Cobos
<br>and Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri. The onslaught, he argued,
<br>would damage both of those potential opponents to a Reutemann
<br>candidacy. When the race really begins, Reutemann would be
<br>well-placed to obtain the Peronist nomination and steamroll the
<br>rest of the field. Massa said that the Peronist race would not
<br>begin in earnest until May 1, 2010, when he said five large
<br>Peronist rallies would mark May Day for the first time in years.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Alberto Fernandez identified Vice President Cobos as the
<br>next president of Argentina. Fernandez noted that Cobos continues
<br>to be the most popular politician in the country, and is conserving
<br>his advantage intelligently. He expected that Coalicion Civica
<br>leader Elisa Carrio, the runner-up in the 2007 election and a
<br>bitter rival of Cobos, would run in the first round and win a
<br>maximum of 12 percent of the vote, deflating the Vice President's
<br>first-round numbers, but Cobos would come out on top. "It's his
<br>election to lose," concluded Fernandez. He took issue with Massa's
<br>view that Peronists would prevail once they united behind a
<br>candidate. Fernandez, a long-time Peronist activist who headed the
<br>party apparatus in Buenos Aires city for many years, said that his
<br>party only controls the loyalty of 38 percent of the electorate.
<br>Given the Kirchners' continuing control over the party apparatus,
<br>the Peronist candidate, even if it ends up being someone with a
<br>last name that is not Kirchner, would not appeal to non-Peronist
<br>voters in 2011. The party's presidential prospects in the coming
<br>election were therefore, in Fernandez's view, poor.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Massa: Nestor is a Monster and Psychopath
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Massa was scathing in his criticism of the first couple,
<br>especially Nestor. Though he made light of press reports that he
<br>and Kirchner came to blows at the campaign bunker in the pre-dawn
<br>hours after their mid-term defeat last June, he called Nestor "a
<br>psychopath," "a monster," and "a coward" whose bullying approach to
<br>politics masks a deep sense of insecurity and inferiority.
<br>(Massa's wife registered such alarm at these uninhibited comments
<br>that he asked her to "stop making faces at me.") He disputed the
<br>argument that Nestor deserved credit as a savvy tactician,
<br>describing the ex-president as blunder-prone and so convinced of
<br>his own brilliance that he was certain to keep making mistakes.
<br>(We've heard similar comments from Fernandez on Nestor's faltering
<br>political judgment -- ref b.) He said that Nestor could not
<br>relate to others outside the narrow gauge of his own political
<br>ambitions: "Kirchner's not a perverse genius," Massa concluded.
<br>"He is just perverse."
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Massa described his twelve-month term as Cabinet Chief as
<br>an ordeal, as he struggled to deal with a controlling presidential
<br>spouse and a "submissive, withdrawn" President "who would be much
<br>better without Nestor than she is with him." He said that, during
<br>his tenure at the Casa Rosada, he decided to do the Oprah-like
<br>daytime TV show hosted by grand dame Mirtha Legrand. On the set
<br>minutes before the show's taping began, he received a call from
<br>Nestor instructing him to walk off the set because the apolitical
<br>Legrand "was an opposition figure." Massa told him he would do the
<br>show unless his official boss CFK, who was travelling abroad,
<br>instructed him otherwise. He then received three successive calls
<br>from Cabinet members pleading with him not to do the show. Massa
<br>did not follow their advice.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Both Focusing on Post-Kirchner Future
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) As for his own plans, Massa confirmed that he plans to run
<br>in 2011 for governor of Buenos Aires province, which could pit him
<br>against midterm winner Francisco de Narvaez, incumbent Daniel
<br>Scioli and labor strongman Hugo Moyano. Massa said that he will
<br>
<br>
<br>announce his candidacy on the third week of January, the week when
<br>(largely vacationing) Argentines buy the most newspapers.
<br>Fernandez also commented on the Buenos Aires race, opining that
<br>Scioli's political moment had passed. Calling the governor "a nice
<br>guy," he observed that Nestor had used him (by grabbing him as his
<br>slate-mate in the province during the midterms) and then cast him
<br>aside. "Scioli is trapped, and he knows it," Fernandez said.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Fernandez remains politically active as well. He told
<br>the DCM that he is talking to many political figures within and
<br>outside Peronism, including Cobos and the fellow would-be Peronist
<br>kingmaker, ex-President Eduardo Duhalde. Within the party, he
<br>expressed particular interest in the 40-year-old governor of Salta
<br>province Juan Manuel Urtubey. He said that, despite his belief
<br>that Cobos is likely to win the presidency, he is counseling
<br>Urtubey to throw his hat in the ring. He says that the campaign
<br>strategy would be to nudge Nestor out in the first round for second
<br>place, and then emerge as the Peronist candidate in the run-off
<br>against Cobos. (Comment: It appears that Urtubey, once regarded
<br>as a reliable Kirchner ally, is listening. He agreed to host
<br>Fernandez in a much-photographed visit to Salta on November 14,
<br>fueling speculation that the two were plotting a presidential run.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment: Common Views, Divergent Paths
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Massa and Fernandez have much in common, from their
<br>unique experience in CFK's cabinet to their active roles in the
<br>burgeoning anti-Kirchner movement within Peronism. They are both
<br>generally pro-American in orientation. They do not, however, work
<br>together very closely, and their futures seem quite different.
<br>Fernandez, 50, is low-key and content to operate in the background
<br>while others take the spotlight. The most that he seems to aspire
<br>to is success in behind-the-scenes political kingmaking, which
<br>could restore him to his former status as the country's most
<br>influential political consigliore. Massa, 37, the younger man by
<br>more than a decade, has more ambitious plans. He hopes to win the
<br>Buenos Aires governorship and, eventually, the Argentine
<br>presidency.
