<br>Summary
<br>
<br>-------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The Vatican's point person on Cuba, Monsignor Accattino,
<br>supports EU dialogue with Cuba and said the U.S. should refrain
<br>from unilateral actions against Cuba that play into the hands of
<br>the Castros - or Hugo Chavez. This is particularly true, he
<br>said, of decisions like identifying Cubans as nationals of
<br>particular concern in air travel. The Vatican is concerned that
<br>the disastrous economic situation on the island and political
<br>tension could lead to bloodshed. Accattino added the "new Fidel
<br>Castro" in the Western Hemisphere is Chavez. In a separate
<br>meeting, another Vatican official recommended that the U.S. do
<br>everything within its power to ensure low rates for Cubans
<br>phoning the U.S. End summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>EU Should Engage Cuba
<br>
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) DCM and polchief met with Accattino on January 14 to
<br>discuss USG views on EU dialogue with Cuba (ref. A). Accattino
<br>was ambivalent about the pros and cons of a common EU position
<br>on Cuba. He said it was important to coordinate approaches, but
<br>implied a preference for the soft approach of Spain over that of
<br>Poland or the Czech Republic as being more conducive to a
<br>positive response from the Cubans. Nevertheless, he conceded
<br>that human rights should be part of the agenda in EU dialogue
<br>with Cuba and in specific European capitals' individual
<br>dialogues with Havana. However, he thought that the island's
<br>blatantly poor human rights record should not block engagement
<br>with Cuba any more than it does with other rights-abusing
<br>nations. After all, he said, the U.S. and the EU engage other
<br>countries that violate human rights, like China.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>U.S. Should Not Be a Hostage to Cuba
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Accattino thought U.S. domestic politics had a
<br>counterproductive impact on USG-Cuba policy. As an example, he
<br>pointed to the recent USG decision to expand screening of Cubans
<br>entering the U.S. by air. Despite being a state sponsor of
<br>terrorism, Cuba does not really pose a real threat to the U.S.,
<br>he said, so the designation was purely for domestic political
<br>reasons. Accattino thought this was unjustified, and played
<br>into regime hard-liners' portrayal of the U.S. as intrinsically
<br>hostile.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Looking ahead, Accattino said Cuba's economic and social
<br>situations are becoming so bad that people could react
<br>violently. If that happens, he added, some in and outside of
<br>Cuba could blame the U.S. for having contributed to the
<br>situation. The U.S. should not allow itself to be held hostage
<br>by domestic politics to maintain the current "counterproductive
<br>policy."
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Moreover, Accattino thought that U.S. policies toward
<br>Cuba help Chavez, "who is the true, new successor of Fidel
<br>Castro in Latin America." Unlike Fidel, he added, Chavez has
<br>oil revenues to support his Bolivarian revolution.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Keep Those Phone Rates Low
<br>
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In a separate conversation with the Ambassador on the
<br>
<br>VATICAN 00000014 002.2 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>margins of a reception on January 15, Monsignor Nicolas
<br>Thevenin, the political advisor to Secretary of State Cardinal
<br>Bertone, commended the U.S. for allowing U.S. telecommunication
<br>companies pursue business in Cuba. Thevenin, who served as a
<br>Vatican diplomat in Cuba years ago, continues to follow
<br>developments on the island. He hoped the USG could lean on
<br>telecommunications companies to make sure that rates for Cubans
<br>to call the U.S. would be very low. This, he thought, could
<br>have a positive impact in promoting political change.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>
<br>-------
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Accattino reiterated the Vatican line about always
<br>engaging in dialogue, no matter how unpleasant the interlocutor.
<br>He also made it clear that the Vatican is far more concerned
<br>about Chavez than Raul Castro, considering him more dangerous
<br>and with a longer reach (not to mention younger). For this
<br>reason, the Vatican has welcomed recent USG gestures towards
<br>Cuba warmly and advocates further USG actions that, the Vatican
<br>believes, would make it increasingly difficult for Caracas or
<br>Havana to blame Cuba's economic and social failures on
<br>Washington. End comment.
