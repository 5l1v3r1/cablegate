<br>
<br>Classified By: AMBASSADOR EDUARDO AGUIRRE FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: During a March 7 lunch with Spanish Minister
<br>of Interior Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, Ambassador Aguirre heard
<br>the Spanish government's defense of its recent controversial
<br>decision to allow convicted ETA assassin Inaki De Juana Chaos
<br>to serve out the rest of his sentence under house arrest (see
<br>REFTEL for Embassy analysis on this issue). De Juana was
<br>close to death due to a 4-month hunger strike, and Minister
<br>Rubalcaba said that the decision was the correct one because
<br>it allowed the GOS to prevent De Juana from becoming a
<br>"decades-long martyr for radical ETA youth." He said the GOS
<br>was solely responsible for the decision, without any
<br>discussion with or pressure from ETA. Rubalcaba also said
<br>that ETA had the power to put the opposition Partido Popular
<br>(PP) "in the driver's seat" by assassinating one or more
<br>individuals of consequential PP rank or position, but was
<br>unsure if ETA leaders would want to do this. The Interior
<br>Minister said, responding to our request, he was closely
<br>following developments on the Couso case and the CIA flights
<br>issue, and was eager to see a cooling of Spanish emotions in
<br>both cases. Finally, Rubalcaba asked the Ambassador for
<br>further reasons behind the postponement of the proposed March
<br>visit to Madrid by Secretary Rice. The Minister expressed
<br>appreciation for his meetings with the Ambassador, as
<br>opportunities to exchange ideas and gain perspective. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>//GOS Decision Saved Lives//
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Rubalcaba told the Ambassador that the decision to
<br>allow convicted ETA assassin Inaki De Juana Chaos to serve
<br>the remaining 18 months of his sentence at home under house
<br>arrest was the correct one. (Embassy Note: On March 1,
<br>incarcerated ETA member Inaki De Juana Chaos was released
<br>from the Madrid hospital where he was being treated for a
<br>hunger strike and was transferred to a hospital in San
<br>Sebastian. When he has recovered from the affects of the
<br>4-month hunger strike, he will be allowed to complete his
<br>sentence at home under police surveillance. De Juana had
<br>almost completed 17 years of a 30-year sentence for the
<br>murder of 18 individuals when he became eligible for early
<br>release in 2005. A National Court magistrate blocked De
<br>Juana's release in 2005 by charging him with writing letters
<br>threatening prison officials, and De Juana was later
<br>sentenced to an additional 12 years behind bars. The Supreme
<br>Court in February 2007 reduced that sentence to 3 years,
<br>leaving only 18 months remaining due to time already served,
<br>and setting the stage for the government's decision to
<br>release him). Minister Rubalcaba said that his government
<br>knew the decision would be controversial, but that government
<br>officials had not done a good job explaining to the Spanish
<br>people that De Juana had already served his time for the
<br>murders, and remained in prison only on the lesser charge of
<br>making threatening statements. Rubalcaba confided to the
<br>Ambassador that as the end of De Juana's murder sentence drew
<br>near in 2005, the Minister of Justice at that time did not
<br>want to see the convicted assassin go free. He thus sought
<br>to slap on an additional charge--albeit an obscure one with
<br>flimsy merits--that would continue the ETA member's
<br>incarceration. Rubalcaba said that in hindsight, it would
<br>have been better to allow De Juana to go free in 2005 and
<br>that now the Zapatero Government was "paying the price" for
<br>that decision.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Rubalcaba said that at the time of De Juana's release,
<br>the ETA member was just hours away from suffering medically
<br>irreversible damage due to his hunger strike, and would have
<br>died in a short time if the GOS had not acted. Rubalcaba's
<br>view is that the decision to release De Juana saved Spanish
<br>lives by avoiding his transformation into a "decades-long
<br>martyr for radical ETA youth." Rubalcaba said the GOS was
<br>solely responsible for the decision, without any discussion
<br>with or pressure from ETA. The Minister told the Ambassador
<br>that despite the De Juana case becoming a rallying cry for
<br>ETA members in recent weeks, current ETA leaders have no use
<br>for him in the organization and will not want anything to do
<br>with him once he is freed. Rubalcaba posited that De Juana
<br>will likely retire to Morocco upon his release.
<br>
<br>//ETA Could Put PP in Driver Seat//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Turning to broader ETA issues, the Minister discussed
<br>the virulent reaction to the De Juana decision by the main
<br>opposition Partido Popular (PP). Rubalcaba told the
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000449 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>Ambassador that the GOS knows ETA could "put the PP in the
<br>driver's seat" in advance of regional elections in May and
<br>national elections in early 2008 by assassinating one or more
<br>individuals of important PP rank or position. Rubalcaba
<br>quickly said his government is unsure whether current ETA
<br>leaders would risk taking this step, but the fear is that any
<br>ETA sympathizer would have the power to change the political
<br>calculus in Spain with one rash act. In discussing the
<br>December 30 ETA bombing at Madrid's Barajas airport that
<br>killed two individuals, Rubalcaba said that act proved the
<br>ETA hard-liners had won out over those favoring moderation,
<br>and derailed the peace process. Rubalcaba said that ETA's
<br>political front group Batasuna is still working every angle
<br>to try and gain permission to run in Basque municipal
<br>elections in May, but the Barajas bombing has made that
<br>scenario even more problematic.
<br>
<br>//Bilateral Issues//
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Ambassador expressed his appreciation to Minister
<br>Rubalcaba for the strong level of counterterrorism
<br>cooperation, specifically the development of the Bilateral
<br>Counterterrorism Working Group. He said the working group is
<br>an effective vehicle to improve judicial efforts against
<br>terrorism in both countries. The Ambassador also reiterated
<br>USG support for Spain's efforts in fighting terrorism and
<br>said that the ongoing trial of individuals allegedly involved
<br>in the March 11, 2004 Madrid train bombings highlights the
<br>continued threat facing both of our countries. When the
<br>Ambassador conveyed continued Department and National
<br>Security Council interest in the possible terrorist
<br>designation of Barakat Yarkas, Rubalcaba replied that he was
<br>aware that this was still a pending issue between our
<br>governments and knows that it needs to be addressed. The
<br>Minister told the Ambassador that responding to our request,
<br>he was also following developments on the Jose Couso case
<br>(the Spanish TV cameraman killed in the Palestine Hotel
<br>incident in Iraq) and the CIA flights issue that have been
<br>the subject of much sensational press coverage in Spain in
<br>recent weeks. Rubalcaba said that although the Spanish
<br>judiciary was fiercely independent and would do what it
<br>thought was right, Rubalcaba had instructed his staff to
<br>avoid any inflammatory rhetorical comments in an attempt to
<br>lower the temperature on these issues.
<br>
<br>//S Visit to Madrid//
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Minister Rubalcaba pressed the Ambassador for the
<br>"real reason" why the Secretary postponed her proposed March
<br>visit to Spain. The Ambassador replied that the postponement
<br>was purely for scheduling reasons due to the Secretary's
<br>planned travel and had nothing to do with any problems in the
<br>bilateral relationship. Ambassador Aguirre noted that the
<br>Secretary's recent phone call with Foreign Minister
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>Moratinos, informing him that she needed to testify in
<br>Congress on March 28, confirmed what the Ambassador had said.
<br>Rubalcaba seemed satisfied with the answer. The Ambassador
<br>reminded Rubalcaba that if sectors of the Spanish Government
<br>continue to insist that there are signs of a deteriorating
<br>bilateral relationship when no signs exist, they run the risk
<br>of reversing some of the improvements made in the
<br>relationship over the past two years. Although the GOS has
<br>not confirmed the Secretary's new proposed visit date of June
<br>1, Rubalcaba raised the possibility of the GOS eventually
<br>making some kind of statement confirming the visit. The
<br>Ambassador suggested to Rubalcaba that for security and
<br>logistical reasons, it was probably not wise to confirm the
<br>exact date of such a visit three months out, and the Minister
<br>agreed with the reasoning. (Note: Embassy is working with
<br>Washington, at the request of the Spanish MFA, to develop
<br>some kind of public statement indicating that S had planned
<br>to visit in March, is committed to coming to Spain, and that
<br>dates are being worked out. MFA would like to publicize a
<br>precise date for a rescheduled visit, but this issue is under
<br>discussion between the Embassy and Washington.)
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Comment. Rubalcaba said he was weighed down with the
<br>issues currently facing him and remarked that he "felt the
<br>weight of Spain on his shoulders." He is currently living
<br>above the Ministry due to repairs and refurbishment occurring
<br>at his house and said that living so close to the office made
<br>it hard to "disconnect": that he is having trouble sleeping
<br>at night. Although he shows no outward signs of stress, the
<br>events since the December 30 ETA bombing have clearly taken a
<br>toll. The Minister said that he appreciated opportunities
<br>such as these to exchange ideas and gain perspective and
<br>hopes they will continue.
