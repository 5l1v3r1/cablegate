<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Stephen A. Seche for reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary. During a 35-minute meeting on January 
<br>31, the Department's Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism, 
<br>Ambassador Daniel Benjamin, congratulated President Saleh on 
<br>the success of the London meeting and counter-terrorism (CT) 
<br>operations the ROYG has undertaken in recent weeks against 
<br>al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) elements, and 
<br>described USG interest in increasing airport security and 
<br>sharing information on travelers in and out of Yemen. Saleh 
<br>agreed to the upcoming Transportation Security 
<br>Administration/Anti-Terrorism Assistance (TSA/ATA) visit, 
<br>requesting at the same time additional CT support. When 
<br>pressed by Ambassador Benjamin about Sa'ada, he indicated 
<br>that the ROYG had no intention of agreeing to a ceasefire at 
<br>this time. In a separate meeting, Foreign Minister Dr. 
<br>Abubakr al-Qirbi agreed on the success of the London meeting, 
<br>and suggested that the follow-up meeting in Riyadh would be 
<br>important for determining concrete steps. Senior ROYG 
<br>security officials expressed support for the Embassy's 
<br>struggle to acquire land and a willingness to act on the 
<br>Embassy's behalf. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>SALEH ON CT ASSISTANCE, AIRPORT SECURITY, AND SA'ADA 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) In a January 31 meeting with President Saleh, the 
<br>Department's Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism, Ambassador 
<br>Daniel Benjamin, congratulated Saleh on the success of the 
<br>London meeting and suggested that stability in Yemen can be 
<br>achieved only through a dual focus on security and 
<br>development. He commended Saleh on actions the ROYG has 
<br>taken in recent weeks against AQAP elements in Yemen and 
<br>assured Saleh that he could count on continued operational 
<br>support and intelligence sharing from the U.S. President 
<br>Saleh said he was satisfied with counter-terrorism (CT) 
<br>assistance to date and with Secretary Clinton's speech at the 
<br>London Conference, but said he "would like to be more 
<br>satisfied in the future" and appealed for the acceleration of 
<br>additional support, specifically citing helicopters and 
<br>vehicles with IED-jamming devices. Describing Americans as 
<br>"hot-blooded and hasty when you need us," but "cold-blooded 
<br>and British when we need you," he asked for a "moderate blood 
<br>temperature" and measured approach. (Note: Also present were 
<br>Deputy Prime Minister for Defense and Security Rashad 
<br>al-Alimi, National Security Bureau Director Ali al-'Anisi, 
<br>and Political Security Organization (PSO) Director Ghalib 
<br>Mutahir al-Gamish, with whom Benjamin met separately after 
<br>the conversation with the President. End Note.) 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Ambassador Benjamin reiterated the USG desire to 
<br>ensure that no international terrorist attack originates 
<br>again from Yemen. He said the USG wants to help the ROYG 
<br>strengthen screening procedures at all of Yemen's 
<br>international airports, and establish a mechanism for sharing 
<br>information on passengers traveling via air to and from Yemen 
<br>as well as foreign nationals who have come to Yemen to study 
<br>at language or religious institutions. When approached with 
<br>the upcoming Transportation Security 
<br>Administration/Anti-Terrorism Assistance (TSA/ATA) visit, 
<br>Saleh agreed to the idea but deferred to his Supreme Security 
<br>Committee (Alimi, et al) on the details. In the follow-on 
<br>meeting, Alimi and 'Anisi both concurred with the upcoming 
<br>ATA/TSA visit and expressed support for increasing airport 
<br>security. 'Anisi, however, had reservations about sharing 
<br>information on foreign students in Yemen, and complained that 
<br>the USG request was too broad. (Comment: According to GRPO 
<br>reporting, the ROYG is willing to share information with the 
<br>USG on American students in Yemen and would likewise share 
<br>information with other embassies about their nationals. 
<br>While Western governments would presumably share information 
<br>among themselves, this system would still leave intelligence 
<br>gaps about non-Western countries such as Nigeria. End 
<br>Comment.) 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Citing Saudi Arabia's decision to suspend its 
<br>military operations in Sa'ada and Abdul Malik al-Houthi's 
<br>public acceptance of the ROYG's conditions for a ceasefire, 
<br>Ambassador Benjamin asked Saleh if he saw an end to the 
<br>fighting. Saleh dismissed these points, arguing that the 
<br>Saudis gave a ceasefire ultimatum to the Houthis, and will 
<br>resume fighting in two weeks if the ceasefire is unfulfilled. 
<br>He called the Houthis "liars" and declared that they would 
<br>violate the six conditions of the ceasefire. He indicated 
<br>that the ROYG had no intention of agreeing to a ceasefire at 
<br>this time. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) In a visit to Yemen Special Operation Forces 
<br>(YSOF) Headquarters, Ambassador Benjamin was treated to a 
<br>display of military equipment and briefed by YSOF Chief of 
<br>Staff Brigadier General Ahmad Dahan on YSOF activities. 
<br>Ambassador Benjamin emphasized common security interests and 
<br>congratulated Yemeni forces for their role in recent 
<br>operations. Dahan reiterated the request for helicopters and 
<br>asked for communications systems and additional training 
<br>courses. He lauded Yemeni operations as having a great effect 
<br>on AQAP elements, and indicated that the operations were 
<br>possible only due to the exchange of intelligence. 
<br>
<br>FM QIRBI LOOKING FORWARD TO RIYADH 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) In a separate meeting, Foreign Minister Dr. Abu 
<br>Bakr al-Qirbi agreed the London Conference was a success and 
<br>expressed hope that the February follow-up meeting in Riyadh 
<br>would help determine concrete steps to move forward. Qirbi 
<br>agreed that a smaller group, focusing on Gulf Cooperation 
<br>Council (GCC) member countries, rather than a broader donor 
<br>group, would be more constructive. Qirbi said that the ROYG 
<br>wanted to focus on the Top Ten Economic Reform Priorities 
<br>over the course of the next year, but would need donor 
<br>assistance to accomplish these goals. He expressed support 
<br>for discussion at the GCC-hosted meeting of funding for an 
<br>extremist rehabilitation center, indicating that an 
<br>educational institute with a long-term plan would do much to 
<br>counter radicalization and address issues of poverty and 
<br>unemployment, particularly in areas where AQAP has a hold. 
<br>Qirbi and other ROYG officials expressed support for US 
<br>intervention with GCC member countries in an attempt to gain 
<br>financial support for a rehabilitation center as an 
<br>expression of regional support for Yemen's stability. 
<br>
<br>EMBASSY LAND DISPUTE 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Supreme Security Committee was familiar with the 
<br>Embassy's struggle to acquire land, and said they were 
<br>willing to act on the Embassy's behalf. Foreign Minister 
<br>Qirbi said that he had been in communication with Minister of 
<br>Religious Endowments Judge Hamoud Hitar, who indicated the 
<br>ROYG's readiness for the purchase and resolution of a dispute 
<br>over ownership. Alimi said that Deputy Foreign Minister 
<br>Mohyadeen al-Dhabi was following up and had secured the full 
<br>cooperation of the Ministry of Religious Endowments. Alimi 
<br>encouraged Ambassador Seche to sign the contract for the 
<br>land, professing that he would personally guarantee the 
<br>investment. (Comment: In a follow-on conversation on 
<br>February 3, Alimi repeated his assurance to the Ambassador 
<br>that the ROYG is prepared to provide for the security of the 
<br>proposed housing site both during and after construction. He 
<br>suggested that the Ambassador meet with 'Anisi, who President 
<br>Saleh has charged with overseeing the process, to discuss 
<br>final details of the deal, including our timeframe for 
<br>beginning construction. The Ambassador will try to see 
<br>'Anisi next week for this purpose. End Comment.)
