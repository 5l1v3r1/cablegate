<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see paragraph 11.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) SUMMARY. Counterterrorism Coordinator Ambassador
<br>Dell Dailey led an interagency delegation to Madrid on
<br>September 21 for meetings with Spanish security, law
<br>enforcement, diplomatic and intelligence officials to discuss
<br>the evolving threat from Al-Qaida to U.S. and European
<br>interests and to explore ways to strengthen our already
<br>excellent bilateral counterterrorism (CT) cooperation. Our
<br>Spanish counterparts expressed appreciation for the
<br>intelligence briefing provided by the NCTC representative and
<br>said that the threat from terrorism--specifically emanating
<br>from the Maghreb and Sahel regions of North
<br>Africa--represents the most important priority for the
<br>Spanish government. Spanish security and intelligence
<br>services have increased their focus on North Africa in recent
<br>years, and Deputy Interior Minister Camacho said he would
<br>like to explore ways to include the U.S. in joint efforts
<br>with Spain and its southern European allies aimed at stemming
<br>the terrorist threat from that region. At a roundtable with
<br>senior intelligence and security officials, our Spanish hosts
<br>emphasized the close cooperation with USG counterparts, but
<br>recognized that it was a challenge for Spanish services to
<br>break down their own internal stovepipes. The delegation
<br>also met with a small group of Spanish legislators to explain
<br>the RSI concept and the need for close international
<br>cooperation on CT issues. Ambassador Dailey acknowledged the
<br>important role of legislators in the fight against terrorism,
<br>and encouraged them to push for strong anti-terror
<br>legislation that punishes recruitment, financing and document
<br>forgery. Both sides agreed to continue a dialogue and
<br>sharing of best practices. They also agreed the Embassy will
<br>continue to serve as the liaison between Spanish CT officials
<br>and S/CT. The visit ended with a television interview given
<br>by Ambassador Dailey on the Spanish business and political
<br>cable channel Intereconomia, during which he stressed that
<br>bilateral CT cooperation was "very, very good." After
<br>discussions between Ambassador Dailey, the Washington-based
<br>interagency delegation, the Charge d'Affaires, and our
<br>interagency Embassy team, we believe there are areas for
<br>immediate follow up coming out of this visit to maintain the
<br>momentum on US-Spain bilateral CT cooperation (see paragraph
<br>11). END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Ambassador Dailey's visit to Madrid is part of a
<br>National Security Council strategy to brief key European
<br>partners on the significant and emerging threats to our
<br>mutual security interests and discuss ways to strengthen our
<br>cooperation to thwart these threats. The delegations are led
<br>by Ambassador Dailey and are also an important opportunity
<br>for him to explain his role and mission as coordinator for
<br>USG international CT policy, and propose areas for
<br>strengthened CT cooperation. The delegation included Michael
<br>Leiter, NCTC Principal Deputy Director; Marisa Lino, DHS
<br>Assistant Secretary for the Office of International Affairs;
<br>Arthur Cummings, FBI Deputy Assistant Director; Elizabeth
<br>Farr, NSC Office Director; Jessie Liu, DOJ Counsel to the
<br>Deputy Attorney General; and Marc Norman, S/CT Deputy
<br>Director. The delegation began the day with a briefing from
<br>the Embassy's Counterterrorism Working Group, where they
<br>heard that Spanish government officials at the highest level
<br>have made clear to us their desire to coordinate closely on
<br>CT, which they broadly view as a shared threat. However,
<br>bureaucratic obstacles still remain an impediment to improved
<br>cooperation, and Spanish inter-service rivalries probably
<br>will continue to hinder bilateral information sharing in the
<br>near future.
<br>
<br>
<br>//MEETING WITH SPANISH LEGISLATORS//
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Ambassador Dailey met with congressmen from Spain's
<br>leading parties, the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers Party),
<br>and the PP (Popular Party), along with a member of the PNV
<br>
<br>MADRID 00002023 002.2 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>(Basque Nationalist Party). He explained the purpose of his
<br>visit to Europe, emphasized our appreciation for existing
<br>bilateral cooperation, and expressed a desire to explore
<br>further ways to collaborate against terrorism. All three
<br>legislators stressed the importance of bilateral CT
<br>cooperation and pledged to do their part to encourage their
<br>colleagues to provide continued support. Ambassador Dailey
<br>explained the RSI concept and said that legislators were
<br>extremely important in the fight against terrorism. He
<br>encouraged them to push for strong anti-terror legislation
<br>that punishes recruitment, financing and document forgery.
<br>
<br>
<br>//INTERIOR MINISTRY SEES AREAS FOR COOPERATION ON NORTH
<br>AFRICAN THREAT//
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Ambassador Dailey, accompanied by the Charge and
<br>DHS A/S Lino, paid an office call on Secretary of State for
<br>Security Antonio Camacho (Deputy Interior Minister
<br>equivalent). Camacho is a valued interlocutor and has told
<br>us before that whatever policy differences that might exist
<br>between us on other levels, the U.S. and Spain see eye-to-eye
<br>in the area of counterterrorism. He said his government's
<br>main CT concern was from Islamic extremism, despite the
<br>nearly 40-year battle the GOS has waged with the Basque
<br>terrorist group ETA. Camacho stressed his government's
<br>concern over the threat emanating from North Africa,
<br>specifically the Maghreb and Sahel regions, and described
<br>steps Spain has taken to work with Morocco and Algeria to
<br>improve their capabilities. Camacho said that in his view,
<br>Morocco "gets it," but that the Algerian government still has
<br>progress to make. Camacho also told Ambassador Daily about
<br>joint efforts Spain is undertaking with France and Italy to
<br>focus on the Southern Europe-North Africa corridor of
<br>terrorist movement, recruiting, and facilitating. Ambassador
<br>Dailey responded that the U.S. had expressed interest in the
<br>past in joining some of these efforts and was willing to
<br>serve as an observer or in any way we could be helpful.
<br>Camacho said emphatically that he was interested in the
<br>direct and active participation of the U.S. and would like to
<br>examine possibilities for cooperation in the months to come,
<br>focusing on the Sahel as an axis of terrorism, drug and human
<br>trafficking, and illegal immigration. Ambassador Dailey
<br>briefed Camacho on the U.S. Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism
<br>Partnership involving entities of DHS, State, Justice and DOD.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Camacho told Dailey that just days earlier he had
<br>signed with Ambassador Aguirre the information-sharing
<br>protocol covering terrorist lookout information as envisioned
<br>in Homeland Security Presidential Directive Six (HSPD-6). He
<br>said the HSPD-6 "Madrid Model" should be just that, a tool to
<br>be used by our countries and eventually with others as a
<br>model for tracking and stopping the flow of individuals with
<br>the intent to harm U.S. and Spanish interests. A/S Lino
<br>broached the subject of DHS/CBP officers possibly assisting
<br>Spanish airport authorities with document checks and other
<br>passenger monitoring. Camacho seemed open to the idea, and
<br>became even more interested when told that the U.S. had run
<br>similar successful programs in Japan and the UK. Ambassador
<br>Dailey ended the meeting by stressing the importance of
<br>sharing CT best practices through exchanges between the
<br>Embassy and the Spanish MFA, and extended on behalf of the
<br>Danish government an invitation to attend a conference on
<br>radicalization to be held later this year in Denmark.
<br>
<br>
<br>//SPAIN'S NCTC DISCUSSES THE CHALLENGE OF STOVEPIPES AND
<br>INFORMATION SHARING//
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) The interagency delegation, accompanied by Mission
<br>elements from POL, ORA, and Legatt, engaged in a substantive
<br>roundtable discussion with senior Spanish intelligence and
<br>security officials at Spain's NCTC equivalent, known as the
<br>CNCA. CNCA Director Eugenio Pereiro chaired the meeting and
<br>began the discussion by mentioning the importance of regular
<br>communication between NCTC and the CNCA. Spain's CNCA has
<br>been in existence for less then three years and was
<br>established in the wake of the Madrid train bombings on March
<br>
<br>MADRID 00002023 003.2 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>11, 2004. Pereiro said Spain was well aware of its
<br>precarious position between North Africa and the European
<br>heartland and said it was therefore vital to combine
<br>resources with the U.S. and explore further avenues for
<br>bilateral cooperation. He quickly added that Spanish
<br>intelligence and law enforcement agencies had yet to break
<br>down their own internal stovepipes, and that would prove to
<br>be every bit as challenging as improving information-sharing
<br>with the U.S.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Pereiro fully understands the importance of
<br>interagency cooperation, and he assembled for the roundtable
<br>senior officials from Spain's National Police, Civil Guard,
<br>and National Intelligence Center--Spanish agencies who rarely
<br>meet among themselves. The U.S. delegation listened to all
<br>sides and then made a plea for more information
<br>sharing--especially early on in an investigation before a
<br>U.S. nexus has been established--and pledged that we would do
<br>what we could to ensure the same. The main conclusion from
<br>the meeting was that we would continue to use the Embassy as
<br>a focal point to drive closer cooperation and streamline
<br>information flows.
<br>
<br>
<br>//THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE SPANISH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN
<br>AFFAIRS//
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) The Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted the
<br>delegation at the Palacio de Santa Cruz, where Director
<br>General for Counterterrorism (A/S equivalent) Angel Lossada
<br>agreed with our assessment that Al-Qaida in the Islamic
<br>Maghreb (AQIM) is gaining strength in North Africa. He added
<br>however that although AQIM might be gaining in logistical
<br>strength and potential lethality, his ministry did not see
<br>any swelling of public or political support. He said there
<br>may be ways therefore of working with the Moroccan and
<br>Algerian governments to further isolate the terrorist group
<br>and drive a wedge between it and the local population.
<br>Lossada said that terrorist groups such as these can only
<br>offer "imaginary victories" through their terrorist acts and
<br>that it is up to western governments to counter this
<br>radicalization. A/S Lino raised U.S. concerns that the new
<br>EU draft framework agreement for data protection
<br>(specifically Articles 14 and 27) create new obstacles to
<br>improved information sharing, and solicited the Spanish
<br>government's views on the agreement. Lossada tasked his
<br>staff to review the articles and look into the matter
<br>further. Ambassador Dailey reviewed for Lossada the comments
<br>made earlier in the day by Deputy Interior Minister Camacho
<br>regarding a role for the U.S. to play with its Southern
<br>European allies and Lossada also agreed this was a good idea.
<br>Ambassador Dailey requested the Spanish provide a list of
<br>best practices on preventing Muslim radicalization. He said
<br>the U.S. was making the same request of several countries and
<br>plans to assemble the responses (without reference to which
<br>country provided them) and share them with nations concerned
<br>with the subject.
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Talk on further U.S.-Spain cooperation on the
<br>terrorist threat from North Africa carried over to a working
<br>lunch hosted by the Charge, whose guest list included MFA DG
<br>Lossada and CNCA Director Pereiro, in addition to Joan
<br>Mesquida, Director of the Unified Command of the National
<br>Police and Civil Guard; Judge Javier Gomez-Bermudez,
<br>Presiding Magistrate over the trials of the March 11, 2004
<br>bombings (currently in deliberations); Miguel Valverde, Chief
<br>of the Comisaria General de Informacion; and Susana Peri,
<br>Sub-Secretary for Justice. The lunch was thoughtful and
<br>reflective, and guests provided candid thoughts on ways that
<br>two countries with different government and judicial systems
<br>can better cooperate in countering the amorphous threat of
<br>Islamic radical terrorism. Mesquida reiterated Spain's
<br>commitment to effective CT cooperation with the U.S. Judge
<br>Gomez-Bermudez provided rather pointed observations that
<br>Al-Qaida cannot beat us if we have the patience to defeat it.
<br>However, he posited that AQ had more patience than we in the
<br>West, and that this will need to be a sustained global effort
<br>over many generations. He warned against a "trashing of our
<br>
<br>MADRID 00002023 004.2 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>democratic system" in the fight against terrorism and said
<br>that if we allow this to happen, then "the terrorists have
<br>won." There was considerable discussion of Spain's
<br>counterterrorism laws, and the advantages they offered
<br>Spanish authorities (e.g. criminalizing membership in a
<br>terrorist organization even without any overt act of support).
<br>
<br>
<br>//THE ROAD AHEAD - AREAS FOR FOLLOW-UP//
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) The U.S. delegation's meetings with senior
<br>officials in Spain's security, law enforcement, diplomatic
<br>and intelligence services highlighted the current strength of
<br>our bilateral CT cooperation. However, as all of the
<br>interlocutors noted, there is always room for improvement.
<br>The Spanish would certainly welcome any additional
<br>intelligence and law enforcement information on specific
<br>security threats to the Iberian Peninsula. Ambassador Dailey
<br>emphasized to his Spanish interlocutors the importance of
<br>ensuring that all future cooperation efforts be run through
<br>Embassy Madrid to build on the close working relationships we
<br>have been able to establish. Counterterrorism is the highest
<br>priority of this Mission, from the Ambassador on down, and we
<br>will maintain close contact with Washington agencies to
<br>coordinate future efforts. After discussions between the
<br>Charge d'Affaires, Ambassador Dailey, and our interagency
<br>team, we believe there are several areas for immediate follow
<br>up that can come out of this visit. We would appreciate
<br>feedback and guidance on our proposed suggestions for
<br>maintaining momentum on US-Spain bilateral CT cooperation.
<br>
<br>-- Southern Europe/North Africa. We would like to soon
<br>follow up with the Spanish on concrete proposals for
<br>cooperation on initiatives to counter the terror threat
<br>emanating from North Africa. The Spanish indicated to
<br>Ambassador Dailey a willingness to weigh in on our behalf
<br>with their European allies, specifically France and Italy, to
<br>see if we might gain a seat at the table (even if only as an
<br>observer) to discuss regional strategies on North Africa. We
<br>would be happy to take back to the Spanish any specific
<br>proposals S/CT might envision.
<br>
<br>-- HSPD-6 Protocol. After almost a year of negotiations and
<br>fine-tuning the mechanics of the information-sharing
<br>protocol, we cleared a major hurdle with the September 17
<br>signing. However, implementation is the key to moving
<br>forward and we hope that the U.S. Terrorist Screening Center
<br>will use the 90-day implementation period to iron out any
<br>final issues that might hinder the free flow of information
<br>on known or suspected terrorists. We will work closely with
<br>Spanish officials in the CNCA to make sure they make the best
<br>use of the 90-day window. We stand ready to assist as needed
<br>in bringing the two parties together.
<br>
<br>-- Data sharing. There are significant concerns that the new
<br>EU draft framework agreement for data protection
<br>(specifically Articles 14 and 27) create new obstacles to
<br>improved information sharing. The U.S. delegation solicited
<br>the Spanish government's views on the agreement. If
<br>Washington agencies can provide background on this issue
<br>expressing specific concerns and issues for the future, Post
<br>can follow up with the MFA.
<br>
<br>-- Radicalization. The Spanish are worried that their Muslim
<br>immigrant population is prone to radicalization and our
<br>counterparts tell us that Spanish prisons have become hotbeds
<br>of budding Jihadist activity. The Spanish appeared receptive
<br>to the Danish invitation to attend a conference on
<br>radicalization later this year, and we believe that they
<br>would be equally receptive to any advice or guidance we could
<br>provide from experiences integrating our own Muslim
<br>populations to encourage the Spanish to think about this
<br>problem in new ways. Post will coordinate with Embassy
<br>Copenhagen to make sure that a formal invitation is extended
<br>and ensure Spanish participation to the extent possible.
<br>
<br>-- Offer of assistance at Spanish airports. DHS/CBP has
<br>offered to assist Spanish airport authorities with document
<br>
<br>MADRID 00002023 005.2 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>checks and other passenger monitoring, and Ambassador Aguirre
<br>raised this issue during September consultations in
<br>Washington. With background on this program and specific
<br>offers of assistance from DHS/CBP, Post can raise this issue
<br>with the GOS at a higher level. We would accept a 90-day TDY
<br>to start, but if successful, we would request a NSDD-38 and a
<br>permanent position, not a succession of TDYers.
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) S/CT cleared this cable.
