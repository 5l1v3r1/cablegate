<br>
<br>¶1. (U) The absentee votes are in, and recounts have taken
<br>place in the most contested districts of Spain. The final
<br>electoral numbers for Spain's 350-seat Congress are as
<br>follows. The ruling Socialist party of President Jose Luis
<br>Rodriguez Zapatero (PSOE) - 169, the main opposition Partido
<br>Popular (PP) - 154, the Catalan centrist party Convergence
<br>and Union (CiU) - 10, the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) - 6,
<br>the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) - 3, the United Left (IU) -
<br>2, the Canaries Coalition (CC) - 2, the Galician Nationalist
<br>Bloc (BNG) - 2, the Navarran/Basque party (Na-Bai) - 1, and
<br>the new party Union, Progress and Democracy (UPD) - 1.
<br>
<br>//TIMELINE TO FORM THE NEW GOVERNMENT//
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The new Congress will meet for the first time on April
<br>1 and President Zapatero will be given the opportunity to
<br>form a government. As his party fell seven seats short of an
<br>absolute majority, Zapatero will look to enter into a pact
<br>with one or more of the smaller parties to put him over the
<br>top. Depending on the demands of each of the smaller
<br>parties, there remains the chance that Zapatero may feel he
<br>has enough of a plurality to preclude having to forge a
<br>formal pact, choosing instead to form pacts "a la carte" as
<br>each new piece of legislation comes up for a vote. Zapatero
<br>has consistently stated his preference to lead a stable
<br>government, making an "a la carte" situation less likely.
<br>The investiture debate is due to occur on April 7-8, and if
<br>all goes as planned and the King swears in Zapatero on April
<br>9, the new cabinet of ministers would then be sworn in on
<br>April 10, and the first meeting of the new Council of
<br>Ministers would be held on April 11.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) No one doubts that Zapatero will end up being Spain's
<br>next president, but he may have trouble gaining the necessary
<br>176 votes during the first round of investiture voting. This
<br>could change in the coming days, pending the results of PSOE
<br>negotiations with the smaller parties. At this time, the
<br>most likely scenario appears to be a pact with the PNV and
<br>their six seats, with the final vote to gain a majority in
<br>Parliament coming from any one or several of the numerous
<br>smaller parties that make up what is known as the "Mixed
<br>Group" (CC, BNG, IU, Na-Bai, ERC). As the leftist parties IU
<br>and ERC lost much of their power and influence with respect
<br>to the previous legislature, they probably would be willing
<br>to join Zapatero for a very small price. Reports surfaced in
<br>the press in the days following the March 9 election
<br>suggesting that the PSOE's natural partners in this new
<br>legislature were the Basque nationalists. PNV leaders
<br>visited the Embassy on March 12 and told us that they would
<br>be favorably disposed to an alliance with the PSOE. Contrary
<br>to post-election statements in the press, the PNV leaders
<br>told us there was some flexibility in their demands for a
<br>controversial referendum on the political status of the
<br>Basque people. The officials said that the PNV realizes that
<br>it suffered a severe electoral setback on March 9, and is in
<br>no position to make unrealistic demands if it wants to repeat
<br>its participation in a Zapatero government. These sentiments
<br>appeared to be confirmed by PNV President Inigo Urkullu on
<br>March 17, when he said publicly that his party would be
<br>willing to cooperate with the Socialists over the coming
<br>months and would consider standing down on its plans for a
<br>referendum in October of this year, provided that President
<br>Zapatero make sincere efforts to discuss the status of Basque
<br>autonomy.
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Although CiU could put the PSOE over the top without
<br>having to turn to the PNV and the Mixed Group, the PSOE's
<br>allies in Catalonia handily defeated CiU in almost every
<br>Catalan province, and there would be some pushback from these
<br>allies were Zapatero to consider forming a pact. In
<br>addition, CiU's demands for senior leadership roles in both
<br>the Congress and Senate (Spain's upper house) may be a deal
<br>breaker. Finally, Zapatero could gain a majority by forming
<br>a broad alliance exclusively with the remaining smaller
<br>parties (most are nationalist and/or leftist), but most
<br>analysts have ruled this out as a repeat of the weak and
<br>unwieldy coalition the president formed during the last
<br>legislature.
<br>
<br>//PARTIDO POPULAR LOOKS TO PICK UP THE PIECES AND MOVE ON//
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Despite external speculation and pressure for his
<br>resignation after a second straight national election loss,
<br>Mariano Rajoy announced on March 11 during a meeting of the
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000348 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>PP's executive council that he would not resign as president
<br>of the Partido Popular. Rajoy said he would again present
<br>his candidacy for this position during the PP's National
<br>Congress in June, and the party's executive committee
<br>immediately expressed their support for the decision.
<br>Although Rajoy appears set to lead the party for the
<br>foreseeable future, he probably will look to reshuffle his
<br>team in efforts to improve the party's image. On March 13,
<br>PP Congressional spokesman Eduardo Zaplana announced that he
<br>would not remain in the post for a second term, in a move
<br>pundits and political leaders immediately signaled as the
<br>first casualty of the electoral defeat. Speculation has
<br>since arisen that the Secretary General of the party, Angel
<br>Acebes, may be on his way out as well. Zaplana and Acebes
<br>are considered right-wing members of the PP old guard,
<br>closely linked both to the Aznar administration and the
<br>controversial handling of the aftermath and investigation of
<br>the 2004 Madrid train bombings.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In a separate announcement on March 13, centrist
<br>Madrid Mayor Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon said he had no plans to
<br>leave his position and would work for the good of the party
<br>in the coming years. After the Mayor had a public dispute
<br>with party leaders in January over his possible candidacy as
<br>Rajoy's number two, he said he would wait until after the
<br>elections to make a decision about his political future.
<br>Ruiz-Gallardon is seen as a more moderate member of the PP
<br>and has often had public disagreements with the party's more
<br>conservative members. The Mayor previewed this announcement
<br>in a private meeting with the Ambassador on March 12.
<br>Ruiz-Gallardon confirmed that he would be staying in office,
<br>and said that he would be taking steps to mend his
<br>relationship with Rajoy and hopefully return to the party's
<br>good graces. The Mayor and Rajoy were due to have lunch this
<br>week. The Mayor confirmed for the Ambassador that Rajoy was
<br>the PP's leader, as there were simply no other credible
<br>options. He said that someone like he or Madrid regional
<br>President Esperanza Aguirre could try and take over the
<br>party, but at the risk of splitting it right down the middle.
<br>He said that Rajoy staying put was the best way to minimize
<br>damage to the PP.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Ruiz-Gallardon said that Rajoy would now take
<br>concerted steps to mold the party more in his image and
<br>decouple it from the strong influence of Aznar. As an
<br>example, the Mayor said that Rajoy had asked Anzar not to
<br>participate in the March 11 executive council meeting. The
<br>departure of Zaplana and potentially Acebes may be further
<br>signs of Rajoy trying to distance himself from the PP's
<br>controversial past. Ruiz-Gallardon also told the Ambassador
<br>that Rajoy would take steps over the coming months to appear
<br>more "statesmanlike," and would temporarily cease his
<br>constant criticism of every Zapatero policy initiative. The
<br>Mayor also mentioned that Rajoy is considering a strategy
<br>whereby he would tell Zapatero that the PP will support him
<br>for 12 months, voting for his budget proposal and any other
<br>policy issue that does not cross PP "redlines," so that
<br>Zapatero would not need the support of the other parties. At
<br>some point the pact would dissolve and Rajoy would be free to
<br>make a public announcement saying that his party had
<br>supported the president in good faith, but that his policies
<br>were leading Spain over a cliff and they could not in good
<br>conscience continue their support.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Both main candidates departed for separate vacations
<br>on March 14 and will return after Easter to prepare for the
<br>new legislature. We will work closely with the new
<br>government (we expect several holdovers and a few new faces)
<br>to build on the progress we have made over the past three
<br>years. President Bush's phone call to President Zapatero and
<br>reported plans for the two to chat at the NATO summit in
<br>Bucharest are receiving positive play among our Spanish
<br>counterparts and the local press, and will serve as a
<br>positive base to our relations with the new government. We
<br>also will maintain good relations with our friends in the PP,
<br>while reminding them that it is in both U.S. and Spanish
<br>interests that we work well with the government in power. It
<br>will be interesting to see whether Rajoy actually pledges his
<br>support to the government as the Mayor suggested, but we
<br>doubt that Zapatero would accept this proposition with
<br>anything but the utmost caution. Rajoy may find himself
<br>walking a fine line between acting statesmanlike and changing
<br>the tone of political discourse in Madrid, while also
<br>remaining faithful to his traditional PP supporters, over 55
<br>percent of whom want him to lead an even harder opposition to
<br>Zapatero in the new government, according to a recent poll
