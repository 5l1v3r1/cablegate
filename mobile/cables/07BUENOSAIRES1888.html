<br>¶C. BUENOS AIRES 1777
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Tom Kelly for reasons b, d.
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. A well-briefed, confident Cristina
<br>Fernandez de Kirchner (CFK) described her policy priorities
<br>to the Ambassador on September 20, a few days before she
<br>departs for a five-day program in New York. Although she
<br>defended GOA positions on controversial economic issues, CFK
<br>expressed a strong desire to promote foreign investment,
<br>increase scientific and educational exchange with the United
<br>States, and "tell it like it is" with American policymakers.
<br>The discussion's conciliatory content and tone confirms our
<br>expectation that CFK will prove a more reliable, trustworthy,
<br>and accessible partner of the United States than her husband,
<br>Nestor Kirchner. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) CFK met with the Ambassador for 45 minutes at the
<br>Presidential Residence in Los Olivos on September 20.
<br>Argentina's first lady and presumptive next president was in
<br>full command of her brief, speaking without notes on a broad
<br>range of topics. At one point, noting that she and the
<br>Ambassador were reviewing topics that would resurface
<br>throughout her New York trip, she said (referring to her
<br>travels and speeches), "This is good preparation, but hey,
<br>I'm already prepared!" She was gracious and relaxed
<br>throughout, not rushing through any part of the conversation
<br>and listening as well as talking. The meeting was CFK's
<br>second with the Ambassador; in contrast, President Kirchner
<br>has never met privately with the Ambassador. She also went
<br>out of her way to ask the Ambassador to "send greetings to
<br>Shannon," whom she recalled meeting early on in Washington
<br>just before the Assistant Secretary was confirmed by the
<br>Senate.
<br>
<br>Paris Club: Willing to Deal "Without Preconceptions"
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) After CFK previewed her schedule in New York (ref A),
<br>the Ambassador noted the great international interest in her
<br>policy views. He commented that CFK's interest in the world
<br>and willingness to countenance policy changes, especially in
<br>the economic realm, were well-received abroad, including in
<br>the United States, as is her evident openness to dialogue.
<br>The Ambassador also mentioned issues that may well draw
<br>questions from journalists, businessmen, and others during
<br>her program, including prospects for a deal with the Paris
<br>Club, the investment climate, prospects for inflation, and
<br>the GOA's relationship with Iran and Venezuela.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) CFK replied in great detail on economic themes, but
<br>refrained from commenting on Iran and Venezuela. On the
<br>Paris Club (PC), she stressed Argentina's desire to reach an
<br>agreement, but reiterated the current government's insistence
<br>that a deal not be conditioned on a GOA accord with the IMF.
<br>She said that Argentina's attitude stemmed not from a
<br>anti-IMF bias, but from a conviction that IMF policies as
<br>currently constituted are anti-growth -- and therefore
<br>unacceptable. That is why, in her view, the IMF had
<br>experienced a "serious loss of prestige in Latin American
<br>societies." "If we don't grow," she continued, "we can't
<br>pay. You can't collect debts from the dead."
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) CFK characterized debt agreements reached by previous
<br>Argentine governments as illusory, made by desperate
<br>governments that never intended to repay. The current
<br>government, and the one that she hopes to lead, sought to
<br>break what she called "a cycle of lies" and restructure
<br>Argentine debt without inhibiting growth. Such a
<br>negotiation, she said, would need to occur "without
<br>preconceptions," and both sides should come to the table with
<br>flexibility and an open mind. She claimed that, during his
<br>campaign swing through Argentina (ref B), French candidate
<br>for IMF Managing Director Strauss-Kahn had expressed sympathy
<br>for Argentina's approach and criticism of the IMF's track
<br>record in Argentina. She acknowledged, however, that "he's
<br>running for office, so maybe he was just telling us what we
<br>wanted to hear." The Ambassador said that the United States
<br>stands ready to engage constructively to move to a Paris Club
<br>solution.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The Ambassador mentioned the issue of bond-holdots
<br>as another potential topic that CFK will face in New York,
<br>noting that the U.S. bondholders are carrying out a
<br>well-organized effort to win support for their cause. CFK
<br>indicated awareness of the lobbying resources holdouts bring
<br>to bear and their negative attitude towards the current
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00001888 002 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>government. She said that she had encountered their
<br>publicity campaign during her recent trip to Germany, and
<br>knew they were active in Japan, too. At the same time, she
<br>offered little hope that the holdouts would get a deal
<br>anytime soon, noting that a law circumscribes what the
<br>government can offer them. She told the Ambassador that "I
<br>know this isn't what you want to hear," but said that
<br>previous Argentine leaders would tell foreign Ambassadors
<br>what their interlocutors wanted to hear, not what they really
<br>thought or intended to do. She and her husband were
<br>different, she insisted; they told it straight. CFK said
<br>that she understood that Americans valued straight talk, and
<br>she hoped that this quality would earn her trust and respect
<br>in the United States.
<br>
<br>Foreign Investment: Bring It On
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) CFK said that the GOA's main motivation in striking
<br>a deal with the Paris Club was to entice foreign export
<br>credit agencies to go back on cover in Argentina,
<br>facilitating her plans to bring more foreign investment here.
<br>She noted that foreign investment in certain sectors was
<br>already booming. Auto companies, including Mercedes-Benz,
<br>Peugeot, Ford, and GM were pumping tens of millions of
<br>dollars of new investment into their plants, with many adding
<br>new assembly lines and exporting much of their output.
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) CFK reserved her greatest enthusiasm for Argentina's
<br>progress in attracting investment in the information
<br>technology sector as a means to expand Argentina's global
<br>economic role. She noted proudly that IT represented the
<br>fastest growing sector in the economy during her husband's
<br>presidency. She expected great things from the sector in the
<br>future. "We have great soccer players in Argentina because
<br>our kids play so much soccer," she said. "Now they spend all
<br>their time on computers, so I know that there's an Argentine
<br>Bill Gates out there. We just have to find him." The
<br>Ambassador agreed that this was an area of great potential.
<br>He noted the significant U.S. investment in this sector,
<br>including the fact that IBM is the largest U.S. employer in
<br>Argentina. He also made a pitch for quick approval of Turner
<br>Broadcasting's purchase of Claxion, a local audiovisual
<br>company, which will lead to Argentine creations being
<br>distributed throughout Latin America.
<br>
<br>Playing Defense: Energy, Inflation
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Despite her expression of enthusiasm for foreign
<br>investment, she was defensive about charges that the current
<br>government is attacking foreign investors in the Argentine
<br>energy sector (septel). She characterized Exxon's apparent
<br>exit from the Argentine market as the result of a regional
<br>draw-down in Latin America, and argued that "the energy
<br>sector is a problem everywhere right now." She said that
<br>private companies miscalculated domestic energy demand over
<br>the past few years, failing to anticipate the government's
<br>success in achieving extremely rapid rates of growth. Now,
<br>there was little idle capacity in Argentina's energy sector.
<br>The GOA, she insisted, was doing its part, presiding over the
<br>construction of thousands of kilometers of new pipelines and
<br>seeking new sources of supply.
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) CFK was also defensive when she responded to
<br>concerns that the GOA was manipulating economic statistics to
<br>keep Argentine inflation numbers down. She said that there
<br>were several biases in the way that the government's
<br>statistical institute (INDEC) had previously collected price
<br>data. She claimed that it did not account sufficiently for
<br>seasonal variations in price data; collected food data in
<br>posh food emporiums rather than in the modest groceries where
<br>most Argentines shop; and focused on private school costs,
<br>while the vast majority of Argentines sent their children to
<br>public schools. She said that Argentina had revised its
<br>inflation methodology six times since the 1930s. The
<br>political opposition, she said, was behind the claims that
<br>current methodological changes reflected a government plot to
<br>understate inflation. She also blamed the opposition for the
<br>growing warnings about electoral fraud in Argentina, which
<br>she dismissed as "bizarre." CFK did acknowledge that the GOA
<br>needs to settle with clarity the methodological issues as
<br>well as to resolve the union problems troubling the
<br>statistical institute.
<br>
<br>Future Economic Goals
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) CFK returned to economic growth as the most
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00001888 003 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>important objective of the government that she intends to
<br>lead. She said that, if Argentina achieves positive growth
<br>in 2007 and 2008, it will represent the first time in a
<br>century that the country has grown for six straight years.
<br>If its economy continues to grow at rates of five to six
<br>percent for another decade, she continued, Argentina would
<br>become "unbeatable."
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) A key sector for the country's future, she said,
<br>was tourism, an area in which her country had enormous
<br>undeveloped potential. With the rise in ecotourism, the
<br>wealthiest tourists were looking for unspoiled, safe venues,
<br>which Argentina had in abundance. She noted that Argentina
<br>experienced a travel boom after the Asian tsunami, as
<br>tourists sought safer places in which to experience nature.
<br>The Ambassador interjected that for the tourism sector to
<br>achieve its potential, Argentina needed to address its
<br>dysfunctional domestic aviation sector. She agreed,
<br>identifying reform of domestic aviation as "one of our great
<br>challenges." Without referring specifically to the
<br>strike-prone national airline Aerolineas Argentinas, she
<br>identified two specific problems in the sector: a need for
<br>more resources and a conflictive labor environment in which a
<br>handful of combative unions undermined all attempts to turn
<br>the sector around.
<br>
<br>Other Issues: Exchanges, TIP
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) The Ambassador raised trafficking in persons (the
<br>need to pass a federal law) and the importance of expanded
<br>educational and cultural exchanges, especially among youth.
<br>He asked for the Senator's support. CFK:
<br>
<br>-- expressed strong interest in cultural and educational
<br>exchanges with the United States, including an upcoming
<br>Buenos Aires summit of hemispheric women leaders organized by
<br>U.S. NGO Vital Voices;
<br>
<br>-- told the Ambassador that Argentina "must not fail to take
<br>advantage of your scientific resources; they're the best in
<br>the world".
<br>
<br>-- reassured the Ambassador that legislation to criminalize
<br>trafficking in persons would pass the Argentine Congress
<br>after the October elections "without any great difficulty."
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) The discussion's conciliatory content and tone
<br>confirmed what we have observed in CFK's speeches and
<br>gestures with increasing frequency: Argentina's presidential
<br>front-runner seeks a rapprochement with the United States.
<br>CFK seems to understand that a pragmatic, enmity-free
<br>relationship with Washington will buy Argentina leeway on a
<br>number of critical financial and geopolitical issues. At the
<br>same time, this forward-leaning attitude is unlikely to
<br>presage the next government's repudiation of the current
<br>regime's nationalist, populist policies. CFK's defense of
<br>GOA positions on the IMF, the investment climate, the energy
<br>sector, and inflation numbers during this private discussion
<br>suggests an unwillingness to break with the heterodox
<br>policies of her husband. But even if the charm offensive is
<br>calculated rather than heart-felt, there is no mistaking the
<br>opportunities that await the USG beyond the Argentine
<br>presidential election. CFK's conversation with the
<br>Ambassador confirms our expectation that she will prove a
<br>more reliable, trustworthy, and accessible partner of the
<br>United States. That does not, however, take away from the
<br>challenges we will face in forging solutions to such issues
<br>as the Paris Club or bondholders' outstanding debt.
