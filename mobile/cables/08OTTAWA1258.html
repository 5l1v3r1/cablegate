<br>
<br>REF: OTTAWA 1216
<br>
<br>Classified By: PolMinCouns Scott Bellard, reason 1.4 (d)
<br>
<br>¶1.  (C)  Summary.  Despite the overwhelming importance of the
<br>U.S. to Canada for its economy and security, bilateral
<br>relations remain the proverbial 900 pound gorilla that no one
<br>wants to talk about in the 2008 Canadian federal election
<br>campaigns.  This likely reflects an almost inherent
<br>inferiority complex of Canadians vis-a-vis their sole
<br>neighbor as well as an underlying assumption that the
<br>fundamentals of the relationship are strong and unchanging
<br>and uncertainty about the outcome of the U.S. Presidential
<br>election.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2.  (C)  The United States is overwhelmingly important to
<br>Canada in ways that are unimaginable to Americans.  With over
<br>$500 billion in annual trade, the longest unsecured border in
<br>the world, over 200 million border crossings each year, total
<br>investment in each other's countries of almost $400 billion,
<br>and the unique North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD)
<br>partnership to ensure continental security, excellent
<br>bilateral relations are essential to Canada's well being.
<br>Canadians are, by and large, obsessed with U.S. politics --
<br>especially in the 2008 Presidential race -- and follow them
<br>minutely (with many Canadians even wishing they could vote in
<br>this U.S. election rather than their own, according to a
<br>recent poll).  U.S. culture infiltrates Canadian life on
<br>every level.  80 pct of Canadians live within 100 miles of
<br>the border, and Canadians tend to visit the U.S. much more
<br>regularly than their American neighbors come here.
<br>
<br>¶3.  (C)  Logically, the ability of a candidate, or a party,
<br>or most notably the leader of a party successfully to manage
<br>this essential relationship should be a key factor for voters
<br>to judge in casting their ballots.  At least so far in the
<br>2008 Canadian federal election campaign, it is not.  There
<br>has been almost a deafening silence so far about foreign
<br>affairs in general, apart from Prime Minister Stephen
<br>Harper's pledge on September 10 that Canadian troops would
<br>indeed leave Afghanistan in 2011 according to the terms of
<br>the March 2008 House of Commons motion, commenting that "you
<br>have to put an end on these things."   The Liberals -- and
<br>many media commentators -- seized on this as a major
<br>Conservative "flip flop," with Liberal Party leader Stephane
<br>Dion noting on September 10 that "I have been calling for a
<br>firm end date since February 2007" and that "the
<br>Conservatives can't be trusted on Afghanistan; they can't be
<br>trusted on the climate change crisis; they can't be trusted
<br>on the economy."  He has returned in subsequent days to the
<br>Conservative record on the environment and the economy, but
<br>has not pursued the Afghan issue further.  All three
<br>opposition party leaders joined in calling for the government
<br>to release a Parliamentary Budget Officer's report on the
<br>full costs of the Afghan mission, which PM Harper agreed to
<br>do, with some apparent hesitation.  However, no other foreign
<br>policy issues have yet risen to the surface in the campaigns,
<br>apart from New Democrat Party leader Jack Layton opining on
<br>September 7 that "I believe we can say good-bye to the George
<br>Bush era in our own conduct overseas."
<br>
<br>¶4.  (C)  The U.S. market meltdown has provided some fodder
<br>for campaign rhetoric, with the Conservatives claiming their
<br>earlier fiscal and monetary actions had insulated Canada from
<br>much of the economic problems seen across the border.
<br>(Comment: there is probably more truth in the fact that the
<br>Canadian financial sector does not have a large presence in
<br>QCanadian financial sector does not have a large presence in
<br>U.S. and other foreign markets, and instead concentrates on
<br>the domestic market.  The Canadian financial sector has also
<br>been quite conservative in its lending and investment
<br>choices. End comment.)  PM Harper has insisted that the
<br>"core" Canadian economy and institutions were sound, while
<br>promising to work closely with "other international players"
<br>(i.e., not specifically the U.S.) to deal with the current
<br>problems.  He warned on September 19 that "voters will have
<br>to decide who is best to govern in this period of economic
<br>uncertainty -- do you want to pay the new Liberal tax?  Do
<br>you want the Liberals to bring the GST back to 7%?"  The
<br>Liberals have counter-claimed that Canada is now the "worst
<br>performing economy in the G8," while noting earlier Liberal
<br>governments had produced eight consecutive balanced budgets
<br>and created about 300,000 new jobs annually between 1993 and
<br>¶2005.  The NDP's Layton argued on September 16 that these
<br>economic woes are "the clearest possible warning that North
<br>American economies under conservative governments, in both
<br>Canada and the United States, are on the wrong track," but
<br>promised only that an NDP government would institute a
<br>"top-to-bottom" review of Canada's regulatory system -- not
<br>delving into bilateral policy territory.
<br>
<br>¶5.  (C)  On the environment, Liberal leader Dion, in
<br>defending his "Green Shift" plan on September 11, noted that
<br>
<br>OTTAWA 00001258  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>"both Barack Obama and John McCain are in favor of putting a
<br>price on carbon.  Our biggest trading partner is moving
<br>toward a greener future and we need to do so too."  PM Harper
<br>has stuck to the standard Conservative references to the
<br>Liberal plan as a "carbon tax, which will hit every consumer
<br>in every sector" and claimed on September 16 that, under
<br>earlier Liberal governments, "greenhouse gas emissions
<br>increased by more than 30 percent, one of the worst records
<br>of industrialized countries."   NDP leader Layton argued
<br>that, on the environment, PM Harper "has no plan" while
<br>"Dion's plan is wrong and won't work," unlike the NDP plan to
<br>reward polluters who "clean up their act and imposing
<br>penalties on those that don't," which he said had also been
<br>"proposed by both U.S. Presidential candidates, Barack Obama
<br>and John McCain."
<br>
<br>¶6.  (C)  NAFTA?  Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative?
<br>Border crossing times?  The future of NORAD?  Canada's role
<br>in NATO?  Protection of Canadian water reserves?  Canadian
<br>sovereignty in the Arctic and the Northwest Passage?  At
<br>least among the leaders of the major parties, these issues
<br>have not come up so far in the campaigns, although they seize
<br>much public attention in normal times.  Even in Ontario and
<br>Quebec, with their long and important borders with the U.S.,
<br>the leadership candidates apparently so far have not ventured
<br>to make promises to woo voters who might be disgruntled with
<br>U.S. policies and practices.  However, these may still emerge
<br>as more salient issues at the riding level as individual
<br>candidates press the flesh door to door, and may also then
<br>percolate up to the leadership formal debates on October 1
<br>and 2.
<br>
<br>¶7.  (C)  Why the U.S. relationship appears off the table, at
<br>least so far, is probably be due to several key factors.  An
<br>almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may disincline
<br>Canadian political leaders from making this election about
<br>the U.S. (unlike in the 1988 free trade campaigns) instead of
<br>sticking to domestic topics of bread-and-butter interest to
<br>voters.  The leaders may also recognize that bilateral
<br>relations are simply too important -- and successful -- to
<br>turn into political campaign fodder that could backfire.
<br>They may also be viewing the poll numbers in the U.S. and
<br>recognizing that the results are too close to call.  Had the
<br>Canadian campaign taken place after the U.S. election, the
<br>Conservatives might have been tempted to claim they could
<br>work more effectively with a President McCain, or the
<br>Liberals with a President Obama.  Even this could be a risky
<br>strategy, as perceptions of being too close to the U.S.
<br>leader are often distasteful to Canadian voters; one
<br>recurrent jibe about PM Harper is that he is a "clone of
<br>George W. Bush."  Ultimately, the U.S. is like the proverbial
<br>900 pound gorilla in the midst of the Canadian federal
<br>election:  overwhelming but too potentially menacing to
<br>acknowledge.
