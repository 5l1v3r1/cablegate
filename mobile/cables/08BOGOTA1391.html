<br>SUBJECT: ARMED FORCES COMMANDER PADILLA ON FARC, HOSTAGES,
<br>PALANQUERO, REGIONAL RELATIONS, AND HUMAN RIGHTS
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador William R. Brownfield.
<br>Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>-------
<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Colombian Armed Forces Commander Padilla stressed to
<br>the Ambassador on April 4 that the GOC would do all it could
<br>to support the French humanitarian operation seeking Ingrid
<br>Betancourt's release, though he doubted its prospects for
<br>success. Padilla said GOC continued its efforts to locate
<br>all of the hostages, including the three Americans. He also
<br>asked for continued USG assistance and intelligence sharing
<br>on U.S. hostages, Venezuela, and Ecuador. Padilla reiterated
<br>President Uribe's request for an agreement on a Cooperative
<br>Security Location (CSL) in Palanquero this year. The Armed
<br>Forces Commander said he remains committed to removing
<br>military personnel believed to be involved in criminal
<br>activity or human rights violations. END SUMMARY,
<br>
<br>-----------------------------
<br>FRENCH HUMANITARIAN OPERATION
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) General Padilla told the Ambassador on April 4 that
<br>earlier that day he had met with the French, Spanish and
<br>Swiss ambassadors to discuss the French humanitarian
<br>initiative on Ingrid Betancourt. (Note: The French
<br>Government dispatched an air ambulance to Colombia earlier
<br>that week to provide emergency medical attention to
<br>Betancourt. It remained parked at Bogota's air base since
<br>arrival.) Padilla saw almost no chance that the French would
<br>gain access to Betancourt, but said that the GOC was doing
<br>everything it could to assist the GOF to ensure it could not
<br>be blamed for the operation's failure. The GOC agreed to let
<br>the GOF base planes in Colombia, fly wherever they wanted,
<br>suspend military operations in areas to which the GOF wanted
<br>to travel, and to assist in any other way necessary to
<br>facilitate a Betancourt release by the Revolutionary Armed
<br>Forces of Colombia (FARC). He said the GOC would oppose the
<br>use of Venezuelan helicopters or involvement of Venezuelan
<br>President Chavez in the operation, and would offer the French
<br>the use of GOC helicopters if needed. Padilla said "the best
<br>thing about this operation to date is that the FARC is the
<br>one being blamed for intransigence."
<br>
<br>-----------------------
<br>U.S. HOSTAGE OPERATIONS
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Padilla underscored to the Ambassador that the GOC
<br>continues to work toward the freedom of all of the FARC held
<br>hostages. The Colombian military is still working to locate
<br>the U.S. hostages with special operations forces deployed in
<br>the south. If located the COLMIL stands ready to assist in
<br>negotiating the release or cooperating on the rescue of the
<br>three U.S. hostages held by the FARC in close coordination
<br>with the USG. The Ambassador assured Padilla that the USG
<br>will give the highest priority possible to providing
<br>intelligence assets for ongoing efforts to locate the
<br>hostages. Padilla agreed a USG-GOC "lessons learned"
<br>exercise on hostage issues would be useful and could be done
<br>at the end of April at the SOUTHCOM-Defense Minister level.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------
<br>ESTABLISHING A CSL IN PALANQUERO
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Padilla reminded the Ambassador that on April 1
<br>President Uribe had stressed his desire to conclude an
<br>agreement for a CSL at Palanquero in 2008. Padilla said the
<br>GOC understood that announcing a CSL at Palanquero would
<br>provoke a reaction from the Venezuelans and Ecuadorians. The
<br>GOC would never say so publicly, but that was what the GOC
<br>was looking for. Padilla said Uribe's support meant the GOC
<br>would rapidly respond to a USG request on Palanquero. The
<br>GOC did not expect Palanquero to be operational in 2008, but
<br>wanted an agreement concluded. Padilla told the Ambassador
<br>
<br>he would call the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as
<br>well as the U.S. SOUTHCOM Commander on the issue.
<br>
<br>---------------------
<br>VENEZUELA AND ECUADOR
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Padilla said that from a military perspective, he was
<br>satisfied with the way the recent border dust up with
<br>Venezuela and Ecuador played out. The Colombian military saw
<br>that the Venezuelan Armed Forces were considerably weaker
<br>than they had believed. In contrast, the Ecuadorian military
<br>showed it was a much more professional, if smaller, force
<br>than its Venezuelan counterparts. Padilla acknowledged that
<br>the Colombian military needed to reestablish its bilateral
<br>relations with the Ecuadorians, but said this would take
<br>time. He again asked for continued intelligence exchange on
<br>Venezuela, and also sought any additional intelligence the
<br>USG could provide on Ecuador. The Ambassador committed to
<br>looking into the matter, but reminded Padilla both countries
<br>benefited by keeping the intelligence relationship quiet.
<br>Padilla agreed.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>HUMAN RIGHTS AND CORRUPTION PROBLEMS IN THE MILITARY
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Padilla said he remains committed to removing military
<br>personnel believed to be involved in improper criminal
<br>activity or human rights violations, even if there is
<br>insufficient evidence to bring legal action against them. He
<br>asked if the USG could help the GOC identify such
<br>individuals. The Ambassador said we shared Padilla's
<br>concern, but did not want to substitute ourselves for the
<br>Colombian legal process or to undercut Colombian
<br>institutions' capacity-- and responsibility--to police
<br>themselves. He promised to get back to Padilla on the human
<br>rights issue.
