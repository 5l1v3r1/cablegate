<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt for Reaso
<br>ns 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>SUBJECT: GOF C/T COORDINATOR,S OVERVIEW OF TERRORISM THREAT
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: Christophe Chaboud, the Ministry of
<br>Interior's counter-terrorism coordinating chief, told us on
<br>November 20 that GOF authorities remain extremely concerned
<br>about the threat of terrorism on French soil and are actively
<br>taking measures to combat current and future threats.
<br>Radical Islamists are still the principal threat to French
<br>interests at home and abroad. Chaboud reported that the
<br>2003-2004 uptick in fighters from France to Iraq appears to
<br>have lost momentum, and that there are no signs that the GSPC
<br>is actively targeting France. The C/T chief also reviewed
<br>improvements to airport security, as well as ETA and PKK
<br>activities. End Summary.
<br>
<br>RADICAL ISLAMIC THREAT
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) On November 20, poloff met for an introductory call
<br>with Christophe Chaboud, the head of France's C/T
<br>coordination unit, or UCLAT. (Note: UCLAT is the Ministry of
<br>Interior's nexus for all counter-terrorism operations,
<br>analysis, and exchanges.) Chaboud set the tone for the
<br>discussion by quickly establishing that radical Islamists
<br>remained the principal threat to France and French interests
<br>around the world, particularly in the Middle East. While
<br>intelligence analysis suggested there were no active known
<br>networks operating in France, Chaboud said the GOF was taking
<br>aggressive preventative measures to ensure that authorities
<br>are not caught off guard. GSPC,s announcement of its
<br>joining with al-Qaeda and highlighting France as its number
<br>one enemy, was extremely worrisome, however, French
<br>intelligence officials had not noted any signs of increasing
<br>activity.
<br>
<br>FRENCH JIHADISTS
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) There were now "very few" known cases of French
<br>nationals going to Iraq, according to Chaboud. In 2003-2005,
<br>the GOF intelligence community was deeply concerned about the
<br>radicalization of young French Muslims to the point that some
<br>joined the jihad in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said. The trend
<br>appears to have faded since then. Aside from the recent
<br>October 20 arrests of three French nationals in Damascus (see
<br>ref A), Chaboud said, French officials were not aware of any
<br>other recent cases. He praised Syrian officials for their
<br>efficiency in arresting the young French men, who were
<br>apparently taken into custody after only a few days in Syria,
<br>and credited intense U.S. pressure as motivation for the
<br>Syrians' haste. Chaboud added that, for the moment, there
<br>was no evidence that any of the three men had connections to
<br>previously known networks in France; more likely, they had
<br>found their path to Iraq through very informal channels.
<br>Asked about the reason for the downturn in numbers going to
<br>Iraq, Chaboud said he believed that harsh punishment from
<br>French authorities, the deaths of their "brothers" in Iraq,
<br>and a local lack of support among most French Muslims, must
<br>certainly have had an effect. (Note: Two of the three French
<br>nationals were reportedly expelled to France on November 22,
<br>and despite a lack of notification by Syrian authorities,
<br>were arrested after landing in France.)
<br>
<br>PREVENTION: IMAM EXPULSIONS
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Chaboud proudly touted the expulsion of 54 imams from
<br>France since 2001. The imams were expelled from France for
<br>allegedly preaching radical Islamic ideas. (Note: In at
<br>least one highly publicized case, an expelled imam told local
<br>media that the Koran sanctioned the submission of women
<br>through force.) Chaboud noted that while the majority of
<br>expelled imams were Algerian, a handful came from Turkey,
<br>Morocco, Tunisia and "one or two Gulf countries." He added
<br>that France was far ahead of other EU states, in particular
<br>the UK, in taking necessary action against foreign nationals
<br>who advocated "radical ideologies." Another 12 imams are
<br>reportedly awaiting deportation.
<br>
<br>PREVENTION: AIRPORT SECURITY
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) When asked about the current, very public, controversy
<br>(see ref B) surrounding the suspension of security clearances
<br>of 72 Muslim workers at Paris, Charles de Gaulle airport,
<br>Chaboud confirmed this had occurred chiefly on UCLAT's
<br>recommendation. Since the 2005 London bombings, he said,
<br>there clearly has been a need to focus on security in
<br>sensitive locations. Given CDG's stature in the world, and
<br>its past as an origination point for the December 2001 "shoe
<br>bomber," Chaboud stressed that dramatic steps had to be taken
<br>to avoid future attacks. "I asked myself, what I would do if
<br>I was a terrorist; how I would get past airport security,"
<br>Chaboud said. The answer was simple, he replied -- to
<br>clearly identify and exploit airport employees who might be
<br>sympathetic to the "cause."
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) After more than a year of investigation, UCLAT had
<br>concluded that at least 72 workers were vulnerable to
<br>exploitation because of their deep, and at least somewhat
<br>radical, religious convictions, Chaboud stated. He added
<br>that while they were not themselves terrorists, they appeared
<br>to be extreme enough in their comportment outside of work to
<br>lead authorities to conclude that they might aid or abet
<br>terrorists. Chaboud readily admitted that GOF authorities
<br>were creating new territory and that the judiciary had its
<br>own role to play, but he onetheless adamantly defended the
<br>recommendations that led to the revocation of security
<br>clearances. (Note: In the cases of 11 of the 72 employees
<br>who have filed legal grievances, the local Prefet voluntarily
<br>gave back security clearances to two individuals. A separate
<br>judgement has demanded that two others also be reinstated).
<br>
<br>ETA STEPS UP ACTIVITY IN FRANCE
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) ETA, Chaboud said, appears to have become more active
<br>in France over the past several months. He repeated the
<br>standard French policy line that ETA is a Spanish domestic
<br>issue and not a political question for France. That said, he
<br>noted that there was intense operational dialogue between
<br>France and Spain about cross-border activity. Chaboud said
<br>he was convinced that ETA is using the time for negotiating a
<br>political truce to replenish its stockpile of weapons,
<br>vehicles, and false travel documents. "I have warned the
<br>Spanish," Chaboud stressed, and said he would continue to
<br>advise them about developments in the French Basque country.
<br>(Note: Recent press reports speculate that in addition to the
<br>rise in stolen property, ETA wishes to directly involve Paris
<br>in the negotiations, something the French refuse outright.)
<br>
<br>PKK: "THEY KNOW NOT TO GO TOO FAR"
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Chaboud said that PKK members in France knew the GOF
<br>was prepared to act if they "go too far." France certainly
<br>did not want to provoke the PKK, which has never attacked
<br>France or French interests, but had made clear that certain
<br>activities would not be allowed on French soil. He added
<br>that the GOF had taken some steps in the past year to
<br>break-up money laundering operations by PKK members. It was a
<br>message he insisted the PKK understands. "France is not an
<br>important country for the PKK; Germany is. We do not have
<br>the kind of PKK members they have there; we have the
<br>intellectuals; it is our tradition," Chaboud said.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Chaboud expressed confidence that France was taking
<br>appropriate measures in the fight against terrorism, adding
<br>that legislation passed in 2006 had gone a long way to codify
<br>current practices and pave the way for increased electronic
<br>surveillance. He noted that cooperation with the U.S. and
<br>the G-6 was excellent, but indicated there was still a great
<br>deal of work to be done with intelligence officials in the
<br>Maghreb.
