<br>SUBJECT: (C/NF) MEXICO SECURITY AND ECONOMIC TEAM 
<br>DYNAMICS (C-AL9-01454) 
<br>
<br>Classified By: MICHAEL P. OWENS, ACTING DIR, INR/OPS. REASON: 1.4(C). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) PRESIDENT FELIPE CALDERON'S SECURITY AND ECONOMIC 
<br>TEAMS CONTINUE TO ATTRACT HIGH-LEVEL ATTENTION IN WASHINGTON. 
<br>WITH US-MEXICO SECURITY COOPERATION CONTINUING TO EXPAND, 
<br>WASHINGTON POLICYMAKERS REMAIN HIGHLY INTERESTED IN THEIR 
<br>MEXICAN COUNTERPARTS. WHILE MOST SENIOR FIGURES IN THE 
<br>MEXICAN SECURITY APPARATUS ARE WELL KNOWN, WASHINGTON 
<br>ANALYSTS WOULD APPRECIATE CONTINUED REPORTING ON CHANGING 
<br>SECURITY TEAM DYNAMICS, AS WELL AS CLARIFICATION ON SOME OF 
<br>THE GROUP'S NEWEST MEMBERS WHOSE ROLES REMAIN AMBIGUOUS. 
<br>WASHINGTON ANALYSTS ALSO WELCOME REPORTING ON HOW MEXICO'S 
<br>TOP ECONOMIC POLICYMAKERS ARE PRIVATELY RESPONDING TO THE 
<br>SOURING ECONOMY. AS TIME AND RESOURCES ALLOW AND DURING THE 
<br>COURSE OF NORMAL DUTIES, WASHINGTON ANALYSTS WOULD APPRECIATE 
<br>POST,S INSIGHT INTO THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ON THE EVOLVING 
<br>DYNAMICS OF CALDERON'S SECURITY AND ECONOMIC TEAMS. 
<br>
<br>¶A. (U) SECURITY TEAM: 
<br>
<br>1) (C/NF) WHAT ARE PERSONAL DYNAMICS AMONG THE MEMBERS OF 
<br>THE SECURITY TEAM? HOW WELL DO THE PRINCIPAL MEMBERS OF THE 
<br>TEAM (I.E. GENARO GARCIA LUNA, EDUARDO MEDINA MORA, GEN. 
<br>GUILLERMO GALVAN, ADM. FRANCISCO SAYNEZ, FERNANDO GOMEZ MONT, 
<br>AND JORGE TELLO PEON) WORK TOGETHER? UPDATED DETAILS OF GROUP 
<br>DYNAMICS WOULD BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL, INCLUDING NOTABLE 
<br>FRIENDSHIPS, ALLIANCES, RIVALRIES, AND SUSPICIONS. 
<br>
<br>2) (C/NF) HOW OFTEN DOES THE TEAM MEET? HAS ANY ONE FIGURE 
<br>EMERGED AS A CLEAR LEADER/COORDINATOR? WHO ARE THE PRINCIPAL 
<br>ARCHITECTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S COUNTERDRUG OPERATIONS? IN 
<br>PLANNING SECURITY OPERATIONS WHO, OTHER THAN CALDERON, HAS 
<br>FINAL SAY? 
<br>
<br>3) (C/NF) WHAT IS THE CURRENT MOOD AMONG TEAM MEMBERS? ARE 
<br>THEY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE COUNTERDRUG EFFORT? 
<br>DO THEY THINK THE FIGHT IS WINNABLE? ARE THERE ANY 
<br>SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS OVER THE CURRENT STRATEGY OR FUTURE 
<br>PROSPECTS? HOW DOES THE TEAM GO ABOUT CREATING A STRATEGY? 
<br>WHEN THE TEAM HAS A SETBACK, HOW DO THEY GO ABOUT RECOVERING? 
<br>
<br>¶B. (U) ECONOMIC TEAM: 
<br>
<br>1) (C/NF) WHAT ARE THE CURRENT DYNAMICS WITHIN THE ECONOMIC 
<br>TEAM? WHO ARE THE PRINCIPAL ARCHITECTS OF THE CURRENT 
<br>ECONOMIC STRATEGY? ARE ANY PERSONNEL MOVES LIKELY IN THE 
<br>NEAR FUTURE? IS ANYONE ON THE ECONOMIC TEAM CONSIDERED 
<br>EXPENDABLE? IS ANYONE WAITING IN THE WINGS TO JOIN THE TEAM? 
<br>
<br>2) (C/NF) HOW HAS THE ECONOMIC TEAM RESPONDED TO THE STRESS 
<br>THAT INVARIABLY COMES WITH THE JOB? ARE SOME MEMBERS COPING 
<br>BETTER THAN OTHERS? IS ORTIZ,S DEPARTURE HAVING A MAJOR 
<br>IMPACT? IS THE NEW DEPUTY SETTLING IN? 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) PLEASE CITE C-AL9-01454 IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF 
<br>REPORTING IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS.
