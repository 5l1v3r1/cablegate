<br>
<br>Classified By: Interagency Provincial Affairs Deputy Director Hoyt Yee
<br>for Reasons 1.4(b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  Spin Boldak District in Kandahar Province
<br>and its major border crossing point to Pakistan at
<br>Weech-Chaman have become the focus of a number of high
<br>profile coalition efforts given the upcoming military
<br>operations in Regional Command-South (RC-S).  Although there
<br>is a high potential for large scale revenue collections
<br>through customs collected at the border, the lack of a
<br>strong, capable district government has allowed powerbrokers,
<br>especially Afghan Border Police (ABP) Chief Colonel Abdul
<br>Razzik, to fill the void.  Accused constantly of illegal
<br>trafficking and taxing activities through Weech-Chaman (most
<br>recently by a January 19 Washington Post article), Razzik has
<br>been careful to maintain a cooperative relationship with the
<br>ISAF leadership to guard his position.  ISAF and USG
<br>interlocutors walk a thin tightrope when working with this
<br>allegedly corrupt official who is also a major security
<br>stabilizing force.  Despite Razzik's power and influence in
<br>Spin Boldak, we will press the GIRoA to establish and empower
<br>competent district governance to counterbalance the
<br>powerbrokers and make Spin Boldak a profitable customs hub
<br>within southern Afghanistan. As one of the 80 terrain
<br>districts, we expect it to ultimately become a focus of
<br>enhanced capacity building through the District Delivery
<br>Program (DDP).  End summary.
<br>
<br>High Level Attention
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Reflecting the importance of Spin Boldak District to
<br>the coalition effort, particularly in light of the military
<br>surge in the South, COMISAF and the RC-South Commander
<br>visited the Weech border crossing point on January 18,
<br>arriving in Afghanistan from the Pakistan side of the border
<br>along with the head of the Pakistani Frontier Corps.  The
<br>goal of their visit was to engage Afghan authorities on
<br>issues related to border security, including cooperation
<br>between the neighboring countries and ISAF convoy traffic.
<br>Unlike the Pakistani and ISAF delegations, which were
<br>comprised of high-level commanding officers, the Afghan
<br>contingent was led by Colonel Abdul Razzik, Fourth Zone Chief
<br>of the Afghan Border Police (ABP) responsible for Spin Boldak
<br>and local powerbroker, accompanied by the weak District
<br>Governor, Haji Abdul Ghani.  No higher level Afghan
<br>officials, political or military, were in attendance, a sign
<br>of Razzik's apparent unquestioned -- but also unaccountable
<br>-- authority over issues pertaining to Spin Boldak and its
<br>environs.
<br>
<br>Cost Benefit Analysis
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Razzik's apparent autonomy and connections to many
<br>influential officials, including President Karzai (through
<br>former Helmand governor Assadullah Wafa, an Achekzai kinsmen
<br>and the president's adviser on tribal affairs) and former
<br>Kandahar governor and mentor Gul Agha Sherzai leave him well
<br>positioned to maintain power and influence in the district.
<br>Additionally, he has been amenable to many of the requests
<br>made of him by ISAF, including allowing his troops to partner
<br>with coalition forces.  Requests to which he has acquiesced
<br>include support for interim improvements planned at the
<br>border crossing point intended to both expedite the increase
<br>in ISAF convoys and lay the groundwork for more efficient
<br>customs generation.  The January 18 COMISAF visit underscored
<br>Razzik's key enabling role in this regard, and his calculated
<br>approach to working with ISAF.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) To this end, Razzik is not obstructing coalition
<br>requirements at the border (or throughout the district)
<br>though his longstanding disapproval of a visible ISAF
<br>presence in and around the crossing point during daylight
<br>hours is well known.  (Note: Razzik tells ISAF that the
<br>reason for this is that the troops would become targets and
<br>result in civilian casualties.  However, daylight is also the
<br>time of day when commercial traffic and money-making
<br>opportunities are at their peak. End note.) He knows that to
<br>reject coalition requests would be to engender unwanted ill
<br>will by ISAF and, in the near term, there is money to be made
<br>in labor and materials at the border and further up Highway 4
<br>where ISAF plans to build a staging area for convoys on land
<br>near Razzik's compound and owned by his associate.  A January
<br>
<br>KABUL 00000467  002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>18 meeting with MG Riley of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
<br>provides an insight into his personal calculations:  Razzik's
<br>main talking point was concern that trucks providing
<br>materials to ISAF in Spin Boldak were not locally-owned.  It
<br>is probably not a coincidence that he himself owns a
<br>locally-based trucking fleet.
<br>
<br>Abetting the Status Quo
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Contrary to the prevailing narrative of Razzik's
<br>unchallenged authority in Spin Boldak, anecdotal evidence
<br>paints a picture of less than harmonious dynamics within
<br>Razzik's own Achekzai tribe with regard to the Colonel's
<br>prominence.  Razzik's immediate predecessor in the ABP, Haji
<br>Fida Mohammad (a member of the Tribal Shura and District
<br>Development Assembly) does not hide his contempt in public
<br>for his nephew.  One local account suggests that Razzik did
<br>not achieve his position through a tribal consensus but that
<br>he was thrust upon Spin Boldak by GIRoA, a view bolstered by
<br>the Colonel's reported links to former Governor Sherzai.
<br>
<br>District Governance
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) At present, the District Government of Spin Boldak is
<br>presided over by Haji Abdul Ghani, a Popalzai tribesman and
<br>Karzai kinsman. The third District Governor (DG) in two
<br>years, Abdul Ghani's predecessor reportedly was removed for
<br>offending local sensibilities by pledging to tackle
<br>corruption.  Abdul Ghani functions in an "acting" capacity,
<br>and recently requested coalition assistance to press Kabul to
<br>make his appointment permanent.  The DG asserts that
<br>resolving his status will give him the necessary clout to
<br>properly address development needs and tackle corruption.
<br>However, the DST's experience to date with the DG does not
<br>instill confidence that this is all that is required to
<br>improve governance.  A broader effort to empower local
<br>authority and fill civil service vacancies will be essential
<br>to strengthening local governance and reducing the unfettered
<br>role of local power brokers in the area.  (Note: Reported to
<br>have little more than a fourth grade education, DG Abdul
<br>Ghani has demonstrated to the DST that what he may lack in
<br>managerial capacity he may make up for in other useful
<br>character traits.  In a November shura in the village of Luy
<br>Karez, the DG challenged village elders, support of the
<br>Taliban.  As reported in reftel A, the local ABP commander
<br>similarly confronted elders in the same shura only to be
<br>assassinated soon afterwards. End note.)
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The other pillar of district governance is a
<br>two-headed Tribal Shura-District Development Assembly
<br>(Shura/DDA), dominated in equal measures by the Noorzai and
<br>Achekzai tribes and their most assertive local leaders.
<br>Functioning as private clubs, the bodies primarily ensure
<br>that donor funds are monopolized by a select group of Spin
<br>Boldak notables.  The cooperation of the district's two main
<br>tribes within this context belie the argument that Razzik,s
<br>mediation has averted inter-tribal conflict.  As Haji Fida
<br>Mohammad told the DST in the company of fellow Achekzai and
<br>Noorzai Shura/DDA members, "there are some who don't want the
<br>tribes to get along," referring to his relative, the ABP
<br>chief.  Without an empowered District Government, however,
<br>there is little check on the self-serving actions of these
<br>institutions, which ultimately undermines equitable
<br>distribution of development resources in Spin Boldak.
<br>
<br>District Development
<br>--------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) One consequence of the interests and arrangements
<br>underpinning district security is the limited reach of
<br>development outside of Spin Boldak center (reftel A).  While
<br>security, or lack thereof, contributes to the precarious
<br>state of many communities in the areas north and south of
<br>Highway 4, district government staffing deficiencies and the
<br>absence of permanent representatives from ministries critical
<br>to district development -- specifically within the Ministry
<br>of Rural Rehabilitation and Development and the Ministry of
<br>Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) -- equally
<br>hamper progress.  Not receiving the services they need or the
<br>attention they deserve from the government, citizens outside
<br>the Highway 4 corridor, particularly in Noorzai tribal areas,
<br>do not see themselves as stakeholders in the district's
<br>development and thus are more susceptible to intimidation and
<br>insurgent propaganda.  Razzik regularly spins this potential
<br>for the spread of this instability to his advantage in his
<br>dealings with the coalition.
<br>
<br>KABUL 00000467  003 OF 003
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) A number of initiatives are underway to remedy the
<br>developmental needs of the District and the alienation of its
<br>residents.  USAID's Afghanistan Vouchers for Increased
<br>Production of Agriculture Plus (AVIPA Plus) program, for
<br>example, has the potential to play an important role in
<br>revitalizing the current state of agriculture in Spin Boldak
<br>and, thereby transform perceptions of GIRoA.  A key component
<br>in realizing these end states will be the involvement of
<br>empowered local government officials beyond Razziq and the
<br>Shura/DDA to enable equitable distribution of resources -- a
<br>dynamic that does not currently exist in the district.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Colonel Razzik's alleged involvement in the
<br>District's illicit trafficking and illegal taxation on
<br>transit trade has been widely reported (most recently in a
<br>January 19 Washington Post article).  His presence, however,
<br>need not forestall Spin Boldak's progress nor should it be an
<br>accepted excuse for continued neglect and underdevelopment in
<br>the district.  By accepting the view that Razzik is both the
<br>guarantor of district security and the lynchpin in tribal
<br>power relations, we potentially are overlooking steps which
<br>could be taken in the near term to improve the overall state
<br>of governance and development in the district, short of
<br>removing Razzik.  Additionally, by ascribing unaccountable
<br>authority to Razzik, the coalition unintentionally reinforces
<br>his position through its direct and near-exclusive dealings
<br>with him on all major issues in Spin Boldak.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) As a first step in remedying the current imbalance of
<br>power between Razzik and other GIRoA authorities, a public
<br>and visible commitment by GIRoA to the district's citizens is
<br>required.  Attracting competent civil servants from key
<br>ministries should be a first step.  Spin Boldak is among the
<br>80 key terrain districts and likely will be targeted for the
<br>District Delivery Program (DDP) by the end of 2010.  We will
<br>need to carefully manage eventual implementation of the DDP
<br>to emplace empowered, competent government personnel and the
<br>full complement of line ministry representatives and their
<br>respective resources.  A carefully managed approach to
<br>support the growth of a functioning district government can
<br>lay an important foundation for improved governance with or
<br>without Razzik.
<br>
<br>¶12.  (U) This message was drafted at the DST in Spin Boldak
<br>and in Kabul.
