<br>SUBJECT: CODEL KYL'S MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: 
<br> WHAT WILL THE U.S. DO ABOUT IRAN? 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador James B. Cunningham, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 
<br> 
<br> ¶1. (S) Summary. CODEL Kyl, accompanied by the Ambassador, 
<br>called on Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu April 6 in the 
<br>first official U.S. meeting with Netanyahu since he formed a 
<br>government.  The main topics of discussion were stopping 
<br>Iran's nuclear program and Netanyahu's approach to 
<br>peace-making with the Palestinians.  On Iran, Senator Kyl 
<br>raised ways to increase the effect of sanctions, including 
<br>possible legislation targeting Iranian imports of refined 
<br>petroleum.  Adopting a forceful stance, Netanyahu asked 
<br>repeatedly what the U.S. plans to do if sanctions and 
<br>engagement fail to stop Iran's program.  Calling Iran's 
<br>development of a nuclear bomb a world-changing event, 
<br>Netanyahu said all other issues become insignificant by 
<br>comparison.  On the Palestinians, Netanyahu reviewed his 
<br>intent to pursue a three-track approach with political, 
<br>economic, and security aspects.  While noting that his 
<br>government is conducting a review of Israeli policy toward 
<br>the Palestinians, Netanyahu asserted that there is agreement 
<br>within the government and among 80% of Israelis that the 
<br>Palestinians should be able to rule themselves, but with 
<br>limits imposed by Israel's security requirements.  Netanyahu 
<br>said the only difference between his position and that of 
<br>opposition leader Tzipi Livni is over the name of the goal, 
<br>i.e. the two-state solution.  In response to comments by 
<br>Senator Sessions that the Palestinian Authority needs 
<br>functioning courts and jails as well as police, Netanyahu 
<br>agreed but said he had not yet focused much on Palestinian 
<br>governance issues.  Netanyahu said he wants to show the 
<br>Palestinians the benefits of peace, but with the proviso that 
<br>if Iran goes nuclear, peace will fail. Predicting that his 
<br>government would pleasantly surprise many critics, Netanyahu 
<br>concluded that he hopes to come up with a common approach 
<br>with President Obama.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (U) CODEL Kyl, consisting of Senator Jon Kyl (R, AZ); 
<br>Senator Jeff Sessions (R, AL); Representative Jane Harman (D, 
<br>CA); Representative John Kline (R, MN); and Representative 
<br>Chris Carney (D, PA), called on Prime Minister Benyamin 
<br>Netanyahu April 6.  The Ambassador, Congressional staff, and 
<br>Pol Couns (notetaker) participated in the meeting.  Netanyahu 
<br>was joined by National Security Adviser Uzi Arad, Spokesman 
<br>Mark Regev, Policy Adviser Ron Dermer, former chairman of the 
<br>Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Kadima MK 
<br>Tzachi Hanegbi (Senator's Kyl's counterpart in the 
<br>U.S.-Israel Joint Parliamentary Committee on National 
<br>Security), and the Israeli Embassy in Washington's 
<br>Congressional liaison officer.  The meeting was the first 
<br>official U.S. face to face contact with Netanyahu since he 
<br>formed his government. 
<br> 
<br>What Will the U.S. Do About Iran? 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) After a brief discussion of the world economic crisis, 
<br>Senator Kyl raised Iran, noting the "sobering" briefings the 
<br>CODEL had received from senior Israeli defense and 
<br>intelligence officials the previous day.  Kyl said the 
<br>Congress is looking at legislation that would target Iran's 
<br>imports of refined petroleum products, adding that there are 
<br>only four or five companies that supply refined petroleum to 
<br>Iran and the U.S. has considerable leverage over most of 
<br>them.  Kyl added that Israeli experts had told the CODEL that 
<br>they thought such legislation would be helpful.  Netanyahu 
<br>said nothing is slowing the progress of Iran's nuclear 
<br>program.  The Prime Minister asked what will happen to the 
<br>Middle East if Iran obtains a nuclear weapon?  If such a 
<br>prospect is unacceptable, what will the U.S. do as Iran 
<br>reaches the nuclear threshold?  What will the U.S. do if 
<br>Pakistan is taken over by Islamic radicals? 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) Representative Harman told Netanyahu that no one in 
<br>the CODEL disagreed with his analysis, but the U.S. should 
<br>give engagement an opportunity to see if it works.  If it 
<br>does not, at least it would show the world that the U.S. had 
<br>tried.  She added that Congress supports engagement on a 
<br>bipartisan basis.  Senator Kyl added that the Europeans tried 
<br>to engage Iran for five years but it did not work.  President 
<br>Obama will pursue engagement, but Kyl said he doubted it 
<br>would be successful.  We should consider what to do in the 
<br>mean time.  Netanyahu responded that the U.S. should move 
<br>quickly.  Engagement should have a short time limit and a 
<br>specific goal, for example talk to the Iranians for four to 
<br>twelve weeks and make clear that the U.S. goal is an end to 
<br>their nuclear program.  Leaning forward, Netanyahu repeated 
<br>his earlier question:  "What will you do if it does not work?" 
<br>

<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) Netanyahu said that learning to live with a nuclear 
<br>Iran would be a big mistake which would lead to a different, 
<br>more dangerous world.  While he noted that he could not say 
<br>for certain that Iran would use a nuclear weapon against 
<br>Israel, if Iran had a bomb Israelis would have to ask that 
<br>question every day.  This is a historic moment, and leaders 
<br>have a responsibility to make decisions.  All other issues 
<br>are insignificant by comparison.  For a third time, Netanyahu 
<br>asked, "What are you going to do?" 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Netanyahu's Approach to the Palestinians 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Senator Kyl asked the Prime Minister about his view of 
<br>the two-state solution.  Netanyahu said he plans to engage 
<br>the Palestinian Authority quickly and will not tie political 
<br>talks with the Palestinians to developments with Iran. 
<br>Reviewing a now familiar formula, Netanyahu said he will 
<br>approach the Palestinians on parallel political, economic and 
<br>security tracks.  Political talks would aim at achieving an 
<br>agreement within certain limits, the economic approach would 
<br>promote foreign and Arab investment and joint projects with 
<br>Israeli partners, while the security track would continue to 
<br>build up the PA's security forces.  In order to do any of 
<br>this, Netanyahu noted, he will need a Palestinian partner. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Representative Harman observed that the CODEL had 
<br>visited units of the PA's National Security Forces and the 
<br>Presidential Guard.  PA Prime Minister Fayyad said he was 
<br>happy with the PA's security forces, and they want to take on 
<br>increased responsibility for security in Jericho and Jenin. 
<br>Netanyahu replied that Israel would be happy to let them do 
<br>more, but it is not clear what Hamas will do next. If Hamas 
<br>forces a confrontation, Israel will have to initiate further 
<br>military action in Gaza. Israel did not want to go back into 
<br>Gaza, but it will do what is necessary to protect its people. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Netanyahu said his government is reviewing Israel's 
<br>policy toward the Palestinians.  There is a consensus in the 
<br>government and among 80% of the Israeli public that the 
<br>Palestinians should be able to govern themselves.  The only 
<br>limits on Palestinian sovereignty would be elements that 
<br>affect Israel's security.  A Palestinian state must be 
<br>demilitarized, without control over its air space and 
<br>electro-magnetic field, and without the power to enter into 
<br>treaties or control its borders.  Netanyahu concluded that he 
<br>and opposition leader Tzipi Livni "only disagree about the 
<br>name," i.e. the two-state solution. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Senator Sessions noted that people everywhere want law 
<br>and order.  Palestinians not only need to deal with 
<br>terrorism, they also need a functioning legal system.  Moving 
<br>from a lawless system, the Palestinian Authority is showing 
<br>some pride, but police are not enough, they need courts and 
<br>jails that work.  Economic development is impossible in a 
<br>lawless society.  Netanyahu agreed this was a valid point and 
<br>uncharacteristically admitted that he had not focused much on 
<br>Palestinian governance.  He added that international 
<br>assistance should provide funding for jails and courts.  It 
<br>is possible to create crime-free zones and begin economic 
<br>development "in bubbles" which would then be expanded. 
<br>Senator Sessions noted that Lt. General Dayton is focused on 
<br>this issue.  Representative Harman commented that "bubbles" 
<br>in the West Bank would not be enough, Palestinians need law 
<br>and order everywhere. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Netanyahu said the "classic rhetoric" of the peace 
<br>process has been that if Israel withdraws, all will be well. 
<br>Now, however, if Israel withdrew from the West Bank, Hamas 
<br>would take over.  Economic development would not be a 
<br>substitute for a political settlement, but it would change 
<br>the environment and show Palestinians the benefits of peace. 
<br>Israel has been trying to "build a roof without a foundation" 
<br>and it has not worked.  Netanyahu said there was one proviso: 
<br> If Iran gets a nuke, peace efforts will fail. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Netanyahu pointed to the example of Jordanian King 
<br>Hussein, whom he termed Israel's best Arab ally and a man 
<br>deeply committed to peace.  Yet when Saddam Hussein took 
<br>Kuwait, King Hussein got on board with the Iraqis.  In the 
<br>event of a nuclear Iran, "all the Arabs will become Qatar." 
<br>We should therefore move in parallel to work for peace with 
<br>the Palestinians while acting to stop Iran.  Netanyahu said 
<br>he thought his government would pleasantly surprise many of 
<br>its critics.  He concluded the meeting by saying that he 
<br>wants to coordinate Israel's positions with the U.S. and 
<br>hopes to come to a common position with President Obama.
