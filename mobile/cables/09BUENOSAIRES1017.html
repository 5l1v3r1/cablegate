<br>
<br>Classified By: CDA Thomas P. Kelly for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de
<br>Kirchner's (CFK) promotion of former Justice Minister Anibal
<br>Fernandez (AF) to Cabinet Chief puts in place someone with
<br>six years of experience working for the First Couple, first
<br>as former president Nestor Kirchner's Interior Minister and
<br>then as CFK's Justice Minister. By dint of his office's
<br>physical proximity to the President's as well as his
<br>portfolio's constitutional responsibilities, AF is in a
<br>position to wield significant power and influence, and is
<br>already playing a key role in shaping Casa Rosada politics,
<br>policy, and message.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) AF has been the most accessible member of CFK's
<br>Cabinet for the Embassy, but, unlike his two immediate
<br>predecessors, he has also not been shy about vociferously
<br>attacking the USG (or any other target) in order to defend
<br>the Kirchners. Like many Argentine politicians, he is dogged
<br>by corruption rumors, including ties to narcotrafficking,
<br>according to unsubstantiated press and intelligence reports
<br>(ref A). Additionally, he is suspected of directing
<br>intelligence teams to clandestinely monitor the emails of the
<br>administration's political opponents, according to separate
<br>intelligence reports (refs B and C), and he has been linked
<br>to reported CFK administration efforts to secure additional
<br>votes illegally in Buenos Aires and Cordoba provinces ahead
<br>of the June midterms. Despite the varied and persistent
<br>accusations of corruption lodged against him, however, there
<br>is no hard evidence. End Summary.
<br>
<br>CFK Rewards Fernandez' Loyalty with Cabinet Chief Post
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Former Minister of Justice, Human Rights and Security
<br>Anibal Fernandez (AF) became CFK's third Chief of Cabinet
<br>since she assumed office in December 2007. A longtime
<br>Peronist and a close ally of former President Nestor Kirchner
<br>(NK), AF has worked over six years for the presidential
<br>couple, since the first day of NK's term. He has been one of
<br>the administration's most outspoken public defenders, first
<br>while serving as NK's Interior Minister and later as CFK's
<br>Justice Minister. Many viewed AF's promotion to Cabinet
<br>Chief as a reward for securing in his hometown of Quilmes one
<br>of the few significant Kirchner victories in the June 28
<br>mid-term elections (ref E).
<br>
<br>Origins of the Cabinet Chief Post
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) As Cabinet Chief, AF has considerable power and
<br>influence. The authors of the 1994 constitutional reforms
<br>intended the position to be a check on presidential power as
<br>a watered-down prime minister, although in practice the
<br>Cabinet Chief has become a presidential chief of staff,
<br>spokesman, and all-purpose firefighter. The Cabinet Chief is
<br>technically responsible for the collection of national taxes;
<br>submitting the executive's budget request to Congress;
<br>co-signing executive decrees; appointing administration
<br>employees not designated by the President; and overseeing the
<br>Cabinet's ministers. Additionally, the President's Cabinet
<br>Chief is expected to report at least monthly to Congress,
<br>alternating between the Lower House and the Senate. (Note:
<br>The last two cabinet chiefs, Alberto Fernandez and Sergio
<br>Massa, appeared before Congress less than once a year; Anibal
<br>Fernandez will make his first such appearance this week.)
<br>
<br>Under the Ks, Cabinet Chief Influence Grew
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Under the Kirchner administration, the cabinet chief
<br>position has grown in influence beyond its
<br>constitutionally-proscribed powers. Since 2002, the
<br>Argentine Congress has annually authorized economic
<br>"superpowers" for the executive branch. Originally enacted
<br>to address the 2001 financial crisis, these controversial
<br>superpowers enable the Cabinet Chief to redistribute federal
<br>funds coming from export taxes and tax collections above and
<br>beyond budget estimates, at the President's discretion.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The Cabinet Chief's influence ultimately depends on
<br>his relationship with the First Couple. AF's immediate
<br>predecessor, the media-friendly Sergio Massa, reportedly had
<br>differences with NK over style and substance. Their tense
<br>relationship soured even further with NK's poor showing in
<br>Massa's hometown in the June 28 midterm elections (ref E).
<br>Alberto Fernandez (not related to AF), who served as CFK's
<br>and NK's first Cabinet Chief, was one of the few capable of
<br>moderating the temperamental First Couple. But even he was
<br>unable to walk the Kirchners back from their
<br>take-no-prisoners approach to an extended conflict with the
<br>farm sector, and he resigned in July 2008 out of frustration
<br>(ref F). Amid a cabinet that does not speak much to the
<br>media, Anibal Fernandez has long been one of the most visible
<br>spokesmen for the Kirchners, and his influence over policy
<br>and political decisions will likely grow in his new post.
<br>
<br>Embassy Interaction with Fernandez
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) AF has been for us the most accessible and
<br>forward-leaning member of CFK's Cabinet, welcoming USG law
<br>enforcement training and cooperation (ref G). Again and
<br>again, he has gone out of his way to rearrange his travel
<br>schedule to meet with visiting U.S. officials and greet
<br>Embassy officials at diplomatic events. Although he has
<br>frequently told us that he is the most "pro-American" member
<br>of CFK's Cabinet, we think this reflects his deep-seated
<br>pragmatism rather than any abiding affinity for the United
<br>States. Our positive working relationship with Fernandez,
<br>for example, did not stop him from criticizing the United
<br>States to protect the Kirchners, as he did during the 2007-08
<br>suitcase scandal (ref H). Nonetheless, he was one of the
<br>first Argentine officials to assure Embassy officials that
<br>the suitcase scandal was "water under the bridge."
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) More political hack than diplomat, AF is a
<br>fiefdom-builder who loathes giving up control over strategic
<br>resources. When he moved from the Interior Ministry to
<br>Justice, for example, he took the internal security agencies
<br>with him. Many believe that even now, as Cabinet Chief, AF
<br>retains operational control over the law enforcement forces.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Although AF confided to the Embassy's former LEGAT
<br>that he was not in a position to micromanage the Ministry of
<br>Justice at first, he said he immediately centralized control
<br>once he got the lay of the land. As Chief of the internal
<br>security forces, including the Border Patrol/Paramilitary
<br>Police (Gendarmeria Nacional), Coast Guard, federal police,
<br>and special airport police, AF quickly imposed a strict
<br>vertical hierarchy where he discouraged information sharing
<br>and commanded security chiefs to report directly to him. He
<br>has boasted to Embassy officials that while his predecessor
<br>at Justice, Alberto Iribarne, only signed a few ministerial
<br>decrees, he signed hundreds. Judicial contacts have told us
<br>that as Justice Minister, he even tried to pressure
<br>provincial judges to advise him of any judicial assistance
<br>requests from federal judges, but subsequently backtracked on
<br>that position after judges complained that the directive
<br>interfered with judicial independence. His micro-management
<br>over even routine matters in his portfolio resulted in
<br>bureaucratic backlogs for us. Naming participants to U.S.
<br>training programs, the visits of Transportation Security
<br>Administration teams to conduct airport/air carrier
<br>assessments, and clearance for U.S. Federal Air Marshals all
<br>required his personal approval. Once, when the DCM visited
<br>Fernandez's Chief of Staff at Justice, Fernandez got wind of
<br>the meeting while it was in progress, got into a car, and
<br>stormed into the office, taking over the meeting while the
<br>chief of staff clammed up.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) A pragmatic and politically savvy interlocutor, AF
<br>prefers not to include his staff in meetings with Embassy
<br>officials. Although he is always well-prepared, his speech
<br>and demeanor can sometimes be crass. On more than one
<br>occasion, he has taken obvious notice of an attractive
<br>translator during a meeting with visiting U.S. officials.
<br>Additionally, he has referred to the existence of local
<br>"demand for young genitals" when explaining the challenges
<br>his Ministry faces in fighting human trafficking for the
<br>purposes of sexual exploitation.
<br>
<br>AF Denies Drug Problem, Advocates Decriminalization
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Although he has not interfered with USG CN activity
<br>here insofar as we can ascertain, AF has frequently denied
<br>that drug trafficking is a major problem in Argentina,
<br>despite evidence indicating that Colombian and Mexican drug
<br>cartels operate in Argentina, and that Argentina leads Latin
<br>America in cocaine consumption. AF insists that Argentina is
<br>merely a transit point and continues to deny the existence of
<br>drug labs in Argentina. In an October 2008 workshop on
<br>Argentine narcotics policy, AF described press reports
<br>claiming that drug cartels had established production
<br>facilities in Argentina (ref I) as mere fiction. He is also
<br>a long-time advocate for the decriminalization of drug use,
<br>saying he dreams "of the day when drug addicts are sent to
<br>rehab instead of prison." AF argues that the government
<br>should stop focusing on small-time carriers in order to focus
<br>on dismantling large drug trafficking networks (ref J).
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) According to late December 2006 intelligence
<br>reporting (ref K), AF advised then Vice-President Scioli that
<br>he should not make counternarcotics his number one campaign
<br>issue when he ran for Governor of Buenos Aires province.
<br>Reasoning that the narcotraffickers are well-organized with
<br>the capacity to frame politicians, AF suggested that Scioli
<br>pay only lip service to counternarcotics efforts. He argued
<br>that Scioli should not assume the risks since drug-related
<br>crimes would never be resolved.
<br>
<br>Ties to Drug Trafficking?
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (S/NF) Unsubstantiated press and intelligence reports
<br>(refs A and M) suggest that AF may be financially profiting
<br>from narcotrafficking. These reports state that AF's ties to
<br>narcotrafficking date back to 1994 when AF was mayor of
<br>Quilmes and allegedly directed a cocaine trafficking network.
<br>The Embassy's DEA section has heard similar allegations from
<br>contacts at the Argentine Counternarcotics Secretariat
<br>(SEDRONAR), which has been at loggerheads with AF. SEDRONAR
<br>contacts told poloff that AF personally called off an ongoing
<br>drug investigation in Salta province near the Bolivian border
<br>when he got wind of the investigation.
<br>
<br>¶14. (S/NF) We have no information to corroborate these
<br>allegations, and we are unaware of any formal legal complaint
<br>against him on narcotrafficking charges. However, there are
<br>two formal legal complaints pending against former
<br>subordinates -- including Federal Police officials -- for
<br>protecting or willfully ignoring various illegal brothels in
<br>the Monserrat neighborhood (within a five-block radius of
<br>Federal Police headquarters) in Buenos Aires City where the
<br>sale of drugs is suspected.
<br>
<br>Spying on the Opposition
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶15. (S/NF) Intelligence reporting suggests that AF has not
<br>hesitated to resort to questionable means to keep tabs on
<br>political opponents. In mid-May 2007, AF, as Interior
<br>Minister, allegedly directed a private intelligence team
<br>composed of retired military and intelligence officers to
<br>clandestinely monitor the emails of provincial and federal
<br>government officials, business executives and journalists
<br>suspected of working against NK's administration (ref B). In
<br>September 2007, he reportedly used a private, unofficial
<br>investigative team to read the emails and collect derogatory
<br>information on then-gubernatorial candidates for Buenos Aires
<br>province, Francisco de Narvaez and Juan Carlos Blumberg, and
<br>Buenos Aires province Minister of Security Leon Arslanian
<br>(ref C). According to intelligence reporting in November
<br>2007, AF used two computer technicians to hack into
<br>high-level email accounts, including Chief Justice
<br>Lorenzetti's email (ref G). San Isidro judge Sandra
<br>Arroyo-Salgado (wife of Alberto Nisman, the Special
<br>Prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine
<br>Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA)) is investigating AF's
<br>relationship with the two technicians, according to press
<br>reports. (Note: These technicians in the past have been
<br>associated with Argentina's State Secretariat for
<br>Intelligence (SIDE) and sought asylum in Uruguay.)
<br>
<br>¶16. (S/NF) AF reportedly may have played a tangential role in
<br>illegally bolstering voter registration ahead of the June 28
<br>midterms, according to a June 2009 intelligence report. He
<br>supported efforts -- led by Interior Minister Florencio
<br>Randazzo and Secretary of Intelligence Hector Icazuriaga --
<br>to illegally procure national registry identification numbers
<br>(DNIs) to register ostensible supporters and secure
<br>additional votes in Buenos Aires and Cordoba provinces (ref
<br>L).
<br>
<br>Transparency
<br>------------
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Although AF once bragged to the Embassy's former
<br>LEGAT that he has a "transparent and honest style," he did
<br>little as Justice Minister to fortify his agency's
<br>anti-corruption efforts or enhance governmental transparency.
<br>Admittedly, the MOJ's Anti-Corruption Office (ACO) was a
<br>weak unit to begin with, but it made no headway during AF's
<br>tenure. Contacts who work for the Cabinet Chief's government
<br>accountability and transparency unit have expressed concern
<br>that the GOA will become even less transparent under his
<br>watch. They note that since AF took over as chief of the
<br>internal security forces, criminal statistics are no longer
<br>public information. Indeed, despite public alarm over rising
<br>insecurity, AF refuses to acknowledge a rise in robberies and
<br>kidnappings and instead has argued that insecurity is only "a
<br>sensation fed by the media."
<br>
<br>Corruption
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Like many Argentine politicians, AF has been dogged
<br>by rumors of corruption. In recent years, some Embassy
<br>contacts have alleged that AF has a corrupt relationship with
<br>the Japanese computer company, NEC. When AF was mayor of
<br>Quilmes (1991-1995), he was charged with several counts of
<br>corruption, becoming a fugitive for 48 hours. Although he
<br>was later acquitted, he has continued to face accusations of
<br>corruption from the opposition, and the allegations remain
<br>fresh in the minds of some Argentines. When CFK named him
<br>Minister of Justice, one judicial contact told us that many
<br>in the judicial system considered the appointment "ironic"
<br>and called AF the "fugitive from Quilmes."
<br>
<br>Bio Data
<br>--------
<br>
<br>¶19. (SBU) AF began his political career in 1983, working
<br>first as an advisor to the budget committee of the Buenos
<br>Aires provincial Senate. From 1985 to 1987, he served as the
<br>administrative secretary for the Peronist party (PJ) in the
<br>Buenos Aires provincial Senate. He also simultaneously held
<br>positions in the municipal councils of Quilmes and Florencio
<br>Varela. In 1991, AF was elected mayor of Quilmes. In 1995,
<br>he won a provincial Senate seat where he presided over the
<br>Commission on Public Health and Control over Addictions. He
<br>was named provincial government secretary in 1997, labor
<br>secretary in 1999, and the province,s first labor minister
<br>in 2001. AF served in former President Eduardo Duhalde's
<br>cabinet as secretary general of the presidency in January
<br>2002, and then as production minister in October of the same
<br>year. He switched allegiance to NK in 2004 when the Peronist
<br>party split into two factions - one that supported NK and
<br>another that supported Duhalde. Since then, Duhalde
<br>supporters have called him a traitor and the "first Kirchner
<br>convert." In 2007, CFK tapped him to serve as her Justice
<br>Minister and on July 7 she named him Cabinet Chief.
<br>
<br>¶20. (SBU) AF was born in Quilmes, Buenos Aires Province on
<br>January 9, 1957. A public accountant, AF received his law
<br>degree while serving as Interior Minister. Although the
<br>Kirchners stifled AF's ambitions to run for Governor of BA
<br>province in 2007 when they tapped then Vice President Daniel
<br>Scioli for the job, AF's power and influence within the
<br>Kirchner Cabinet has steadily grown. He accompanied CFK to
<br>the United States in July when she went to the OAS to discuss
<br>the political crisis in Honduras. He also accompanied her in
<br>May 2007 when she addressed the American Jewish Committee as
<br>Senator and First Lady. During that visit, he met with the
<br>U.S. Attorney General, FBI officials, and State Department
<br>officers on TIP-related issues. AF lives in the trendy
<br>waterfront Puerto Madero neighborhood in Buenos Aires City
<br>with his wife and one son. A fan of technology, he carries
<br>multiple cell phones and his office has six television sets
<br>permanently tuned in to every local news channel. He speaks
<br>limited English.
<br>
<br>Comment: Handle with Care
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶21. (S) For USG officials, Anibal Fernandez has long been the
<br>most readily accessible GOA cabinet member. That has
<br>continued since he became Cabinet Chief, assuming more
<br>importance than ever. Fernandez has far better access to the
<br>ruling first couple than any other member of the Cabinet;
<br>perhaps only reclusive Casa Rosada staffer Carlos Zannini has
<br>more influence with the Kirchners. Given AF's importance,
<br>accessibility, and the absence of hard evidence to
<br>substantiate the allegations described above, we continue to
<br>meet and work with him. At the same time, there are enough
<br>rumors about Fernandez -- even in this rumor-plagued,
<br>conspiratorial society -- to approach interactions with him
<br>with some caution.
