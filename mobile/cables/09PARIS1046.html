<br>SUBJECT: IRAN: EU DIPLOMATS TO ATTEND AHMADINEJAD 
<br>INAUGURATION 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Kathleen H. Allegrone, for 
<br>reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C/NF) European Union members will send low-ranking 
<br>diplomats to the first of two inauguration ceremonies for 
<br>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but they will not inform the Iranians of 
<br>their plans, according to French MFA Acting Middle East 
<br>Director (Assistant-Secretary equivalent) Jean-Christophe 
<br>Paucelle.  If the Iranians find out beforehand that the EU 
<br>will not send Ambassador-level representation, Paucelle told 
<br>poloff early July 31, then they may rescind the invitations 
<br>to the August 3 event, as they did in similar circumstances 
<br>prior to former President Khatami's inauguration in 1997. 
<br>"It's hard to keep a secret when 27 nations are involved," 
<br>Paucelle noted, "but we are trying."  Only the Swedish EU 
<br>Presidency will be represented by an Ambassador, Paucelle 
<br>said. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C/NF) All EU members will, however, send their 
<br>Ambassadors to the August 5 inauguration ceremony in the 
<br>Iranian Parliament.  Paucelle adopted a defensive tone when 
<br>explaining this decision, which he said was finalized in 
<br>Brussels the morning of July 31.  He admitted this issue had 
<br>generated tense and fractious debate among European foreign 
<br>ministers.  "We are caught between two conflicting 
<br>objectives," Paucelle explained.  "On the one hand, we want 
<br>to communicate that we do not approve of this illegitimate 
<br>election.  On the other hand, we need to be realistic: the 
<br>power is in the hands of Khameini and Ahmadinejad, including 
<br>the nuclear file, and we must negotiate with those in power. 
<br>You are in the same position."  Paucelle insisted that the EU 
<br>will continue to respect what he described as "the Durban red 
<br>lines."  "We will walk right out if Ahmadinejad denies the 
<br>Holocaust or declares that his regime will destroy Israel." 
<br>(NOTE: Paucelle admitted that since non-Muslims had never 
<br>before received an invitation to the inauguration ceremony 
<br>presided over by the Supreme Leader, EU diplomats in Tehran 
<br>have never entered the building where the event will take 
<br>place, and so they are not sure how they will stage their 
<br>walk-out, logistically, should they need to do so.  They are 
<br>worried that the doors may be locked.  END NOTE.)  Paucelle 
<br>also reported that the German Ambassador will return from his 
<br>vacation on August 4 to ensure that he will miss the first 
<br>ceremony and attend the second one along with his EU 
<br>counterparts.  The British Ambassador will attend as well, 
<br>even without credentials.  "The Iranians are desperate for 
<br>recognition and so they have disregarded their usual devotion 
<br>to protocol -- and their anti-British vitriol -- on this 
<br>occasion." 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C/NF) Paucelle said that the case of detained French 
<br>citizen Clothilde Reiss has also influenced the EU decision 
<br>to attend the inauguration ceremonies.  "We think she may be 
<br>released soon, and we don't want to create another irritant," 
<br>Paucelle said.  "There are enough already."  He reported that 
<br>the French have reason to believe Reiss may form part of a 
<br>group of detainees likely to be released on the August 7 
<br>anniversary of Imam Mahdi.  Paucelle noted that a letter 
<br>released July 29 by Ahmadinejad supported the idea of 
<br>granting clemency to post-election protesters during Mahdi 
<br>celebrations.  "The Iranians will need to take face-saving 
<br>measures, and so she will likely transfer to house arrest or 
<br>some other status," Paucelle said.  He added that, of course, 
<br>she may not be released at all next week, but the French 
<br>remain optimistic that she will soon be out of prison.
