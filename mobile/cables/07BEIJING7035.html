<br>
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Although the Communist Party employed a more
<br>sophisticated media strategy during the 17th Communist
<br>Party Congress October 15-21, local contacts tell us
<br>they were disappointed with the Party's tight
<br>regulation of domestic coverage while the Congress was
<br>in session.  Press controls inside China were at least
<br>as severe, if not slightly more so, than during the
<br>16th Party Congress in 2002.  Although reporters this
<br>time were treated to more press conferences and
<br>granted greater access to meetings and delegates,
<br>journalists were given very little of substance to
<br>report.  Caijing, a magazine known for cutting edge
<br>reporting, was denied press credentials altogether,
<br>according to one contact.  Some sources tell us,
<br>however, that the Party leadership believes the
<br>improved treatment of foreign journalists resulted in
<br>more positive international coverage of the Congress.
<br>End summary.
<br>
<br>Access Versus Substance
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In the lead up to the 17th Communist Party
<br>Congress, Chinese official media trumpeted the
<br>unprecedented number of journalists, both foreign and
<br>domestic, who had received credentials to cover the
<br>event.  Altogether, according to a Xinhua News Agency
<br>report, the Party accredited 807 domestic and 1,135
<br>foreign reporters, compared with 570 domestic and 840
<br>foreign journalists for the 16th Party Congress in
<br>¶2002.  Xinhua also boasted about the greater number of
<br>press conferences that took place on the margins of
<br>the Congress and the expanded ability of journalists
<br>to observe meetings and interview delegates.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Local journalists generally agreed that while
<br>Party propaganda officials went through the motions of
<br>media openness, they offered reporters very little of
<br>substance.  The "unprecedented" access to delegates,
<br>several contacts told us, amounted to little more than
<br>listening to a wider array of Party leaders
<br>robotically praise General Secretary Hu Jintao's
<br>political report.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told Poloff XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX that even though domestic journalists were granted
<br>entree to more meetings than at previous Party
<br>Congresses, the reporting they were actually allowed
<br>to print was so restricted that the greater access did
<br>not result in better coverage.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX (protect) told Poloff XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>that he had originally wanted to skip covering the
<br>17th Party Congress altogether.  Domestic reporting of
<br>the Congress was "meaningless," XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>Press Controls at Least As Tight As 2002
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX that controls on domestic coverage of the
<br>17th Party Congress were at least as tight, if not
<br>more so, than they were during the 16th Party Congress
<br>in 2002.  The extent of these restrictions can be
<br>seen, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, in the nearly identical front pages
<br>Chinese newspapers printed October 23, the day after
<br>the Party unveiled the new nine-member Politburo
<br>Standing Committee (PBSC).  Nearly every Chinese
<br>paper, XXXXXXXXXXXX observed, ran "Hu Jintao Elected General
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00007035  002 OF 003
<br>
<br>Secretary" as the top headline.  The Southern
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>Metropolis News (Nanfang Dushi Bao) was the only paper
<br>to push these limits by inserting some actual news
<br>into its October 23 headline:  "Still Nine Standing
<br>Committee Members, Four Are New."  Had Chinese
<br>journalists been allowed to report the unveiling of
<br>the new PBSC as a real news event, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, then the
<br>headlines would have been about the promotion of Xi
<br>Jinping and Li Keqiang directly to the PBSC thus
<br>bypassing the regular Politburo.
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) While several media contacts have said that
<br>press credentials for this latest Congress were easier
<br>to obtain than in the past (Ref A), at least one
<br>independent-minded publication was left in the cold.XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>No Tears On CCTV
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) China's domestic media took to heart Party guidance
<br>that news coverage remain upbeat and that negative
<br>stories should be avoided (Ref A).  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told Poloff XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>that some media outlets took these directives against
<br>negative news to extremes.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said his friends at
<br>China Central Television (CCTV) told him that station
<br>managers had banned all "negative" images from the
<br>screen.  During the Congress, CCTV would not show
<br>images of people crying, regardless of the
<br>circumstances.  Even nature shows depicting animals
<br>stalking and killing prey were cut because such scenes
<br>were considered "inharmonious," XXXXXXXXXXXX said.
<br>
<br>Party Happy With International Coverage
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Some contacts, however, said that the Party
<br>Congress media strategy of keeping journalists busy
<br>with press conferences and junkets (propaganda
<br>officials took foreign journalists to visit the newly
<br>constructed National Grand Theater as well as Olympic
<br>sites) was effective in terms of managing
<br>international coverage.  Communist Party leaders, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said, are generally pleased with the
<br>international coverage of the Congress.  Overall the
<br>international press was more positive than it was
<br>during 16th Party Congress in 2002, XXXXXXXXXXXX commented,
<br>with more focus on individual leaders and less on
<br>factional infighting.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said he gives the
<br>Party Congress Media Center a grade of "90 percent"
<br>for its management of the international press.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>agreed with XXXXXXXXXXXX that international reporting was more
<br>to the Party's liking than in 2002.  While reporters
<br>for the Associated Press might have been upset with
<br>the lack of substance, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, reporters from the
<br>developing world were generally pleased with the cushy
<br>treatment they received.
<br>
<br>Internet Controls and Baidu Hijacking
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00007035  003 OF 003
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Contacts were nearly unanimous in their
<br>assessment that Internet controls were extremely tigt
<br>during the Congress.  Popular websites scrubed their
<br>chat rooms of even the most mildly negative or
<br>sarcastic postings, several of our interlocutors told
<br>us.  Numerous foreign media outlets reported that on
<br>October 18 Chinese Internet users conducting searches
<br>using Yahoo and Google were redirected to the Chinese
<br>search engine Baidu (Ref B).  While many Beijing-based
<br>contacts had not heard of these reports, Emboffs
<br>experienced this hijacking phenomenon first hand both
<br>in Beijing and in Chengdu.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX (protect) told Poloff on XXXXXXXXXXXX that
<br>certain Google searches had indeed been rerouted.  For
<br>example, typing in "Dalai Lama" would get you
<br>immediately rerouted to Baidu, with a message that
<br>"there is no information on your request."  Most
<br>searches on Google, however, were not interfered with,
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>told Poloff that Baidu has a bad reputation among
<br>journalists because of its alleged kowtowing to
<br>Chinese authorities.  For example, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, a Baidu
<br>search of former Party Secretary Jiang Zemin reveals
<br>nothing but fawning news pieces.  Baidu, XXXXXXXXXXXX said,
<br>actually gets more freedom because of its close
<br>relationship with the Chinese Government and thus is
<br>the best search engine for searches using Chinese
<br>characters.  Google remains the best for English
<br>searches, XXXXXXXXXXXX said.
<br>
<br>"Depressing" State of Press Freedom
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told Poloff XXXXXXXXXXXX that the tight media
<br>controls surrounding the Congress were expected but
<br>"depressing" nonetheless.  XXXXXXXXXXXX commented that no
<br>information about internal Party deliberations was
<br>revealed in the media and China's press was devoid of
<br>any real news during the Congress.  "Even at the very
<br>end, nobody knew for sure if the Standing Committee
<br>would have nine or seven members," XXXXXXXXXXXX said, "why must
<br>all of this be kept so secret?"  This information
<br>control has had a dampening effect on public and
<br>academic debate about policy directions China should
<br>take, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told Poloff XXXXXXXXXXXX that he and other
<br>liberal academics have had great difficulty in recent
<br>months publishing "sensitive" articles, particularly
<br>dealing with democracy and rule of law, as a result of
<br>the Congress.  However, XXXXXXXXXXXX said that even though
<br>press controls remain tight, the Party has lost much
<br>of its ability to set the public agenda.  The
<br>Communist Party can still control what is covered in
<br>the media, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, "but they cannot dictate what
<br>people care about."  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>echoed this point, noting that the wider array of
<br>media options now makes it easier for Chinese to tune
<br>out Party Congress propaganda.  "Rather than watch
<br>CCTV coverage of the Congress," XXXXXXXXXXXX said, "people can
<br>now just switch to one of the 60 other channels
<br>available."
