<br>¶C. 2005 MADRID 4308
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Embassy officials from Legat, the Consular Section,
<br>and the Political Section met with National Court Chief
<br>Prosecutor Javier Zaragoza on 1/18 to review developments in
<br>the Spanish court case charging three U.S. servicemen with
<br>murder and war crimes in the April 2003 death of Spanish
<br>cameraman Jose Couso during the takeover of Baghdad (REFS A
<br>and B). Poloff noted that they were not acting under
<br>instruction and simply wanted to meet informally with
<br>Zaragoza to review a case of great sensitivity to the USG.
<br>Emboffs noted the rapid decision of Examining Magistrate
<br>Santiago Pedraz to re-issue international detention orders
<br>against the three accused servicemen (REF B) and asked
<br>whether Spanish authorities intended to submit bilateral
<br>extradition requests to the U.S. as well for the three
<br>servicemen.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Zaragoza said that he was not yet in a position to
<br>determine whether or not bilateral extradition requests would
<br>be filed because he had not reviewed the case himself
<br>sufficiently to establish the best course of action (Zaragoza
<br>was not working at the National Court at the time the Couso
<br>case was reviewed and dismissed). He noted that the Couso
<br>case had moved swiftly at a time when he was preoccupied with
<br>the recent handover of ETA terrorist suspects to Spain by
<br>French authorities, which involved new legal ground for the
<br>Spanish authorities. However, Zaragoza said that he was
<br>aware of Spanish Attorney General Candido Conde Pumpido's
<br>interest and involvement in the case (REF C) and assured
<br>Emboffs that his office would carefully study all aspects of
<br>the case and would proceed at a deliberate pace. He said
<br>that the existence of a U.S. investigation of the incident
<br>was understood to be an important consideration, but left
<br>open the possibility that the Prosecutor's Office would seek
<br>additional information from USG authorities.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The Consular Section's legal adviser asked Zaragoza
<br>whether he could confirm news reports that the Examining
<br>Magistrate had requested that his office prepare a report on
<br>whether U.S. assets could be embargoed (frozen) as part of a
<br>civil component of the Couso family's suit against the U.S.
<br>servicemen. Zaragoza scanned the Examining Magistrate's
<br>request and said that the magistrate's order merely
<br>transmitted this request by the plaintiffs; the National
<br>Prosecutor's office had to undertake a careful review of
<br>Spanish case law before responding to the request.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Our objective in this initial meeting with Zaragoza
<br>was to sensitize him to the USG's concerns in this case,
<br>since he had no involvement in this case when it first came
<br>before the National Court. Zaragoza is a seasoned prosecutor
<br>with a clear understanding of the political implications of
<br>this case and we anticipate that he will proceed as carefully
<br>as he said he would. As soon as Zaragoza informs us how he
<br>intends to proceed, we will convey this information to
<br>interested Washington agencies. We will also follow up at
<br>higher levels in the Spanish Government to reinforce the
<br>implications of this case for bilateral relations and on
<br>international law.
