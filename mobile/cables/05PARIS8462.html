<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt for reaso 
<br>ns 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Council of Europe Secretary General Davis 
<br>warned the Ambassador December 12, citing NATO 
<br>"unresponsiveness" to repeated written queries, that he 
<br>intended soon "to go public" with respect to the alleged use 
<br>of KFOR-run detention centers in Kosovo for secret CIA secret 
<br>prisons (this despite the fact that French NATO officers 
<br>present at the scene have categorically rejected the 
<br>allegations). On renditions, Davis took a more discreet 
<br>approach, saying that this was an issue the CoE's 
<br>Parliamentary Assembly (PACE), not its SYG, was addressing; 
<br>he added that in fact this was a matter between the COE and 
<br>individual member states rather than between the COE and the 
<br>U.S. PACE President Rene van der Linden and investigator 
<br>Dick Marty have taken a confrontational approach in advance 
<br>of a January 23-27 plenary session, publicly stirring the pot 
<br>in member states by provocatively accusing the U.S. of 
<br>withholding information. End summary. 
<br>
<br>Kosovo:Access to Alleged secret detention center 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) During a December 12 meeting with the Ambassador, 
<br>Council of Europe (COE) Secretary General Terry Davis 
<br>complained of what he described as continued NATO 
<br>unresponsiveness to COE requests for access to KFOR-run 
<br>detention centers in Kosovo. He claimed he had sent seven 
<br>separate letters to NATO SYG de Hoop Sheffer, none of which 
<br>had elicited a satisfactory response. Davis described Kosovo 
<br>as a "black hole" for the COE Committee on the Prevention of 
<br>Torture, notwithstanding the fact that the COE charter gives 
<br>the organization the right to visit any detention place in 
<br>member states. Given NATO's obsructionism, Davis told the 
<br>Ambassador -- "as a courtesy," he said -- that he would have 
<br>no/no choice but to "go public" over the issue in early 2006. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Davis concluded that others, but not he, had begun to 
<br>"connect the dots" and were speculating that Kosovo might be 
<br>a site for secret CIA prisons free from international 
<br>scrutiny. We note that on November 26, Le Monde carried an 
<br>article in which the COE's Human Rights Commissioner, Alvaro 
<br>Gil-Robles, is reported as claiming that a September 2002 
<br>visit to Camp Bondsteel had given him the impression that it 
<br>may have served as a detainee camp. This story was rebutted 
<br>the following day in Le Figaro and Le Monde by the French 
<br>general who was in charge of KFOR at the time, who stated 
<br>that all interrogations of suspects at Bondsteel had been 
<br>conducted in the presence of NATO -- that is to say, French 
<br>-- officers. 
<br>
<br>Renditions 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) On the renditions issue more broadly, Davis noted that 
<br>PACE President van der Linden and investigator Marty, rather 
<br>than he, were addressing the matter for the COE. He assured 
<br>the Ambassador that he personally viewed the question as one 
<br>between the COE and its member states, not between the CoE 
<br>and the U.S. Davis noted that the COE had asked European 
<br>member state governments, in light of allegations of secret 
<br>prisons, whether they were in any way involved. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Van der Linden and Dick Marty, for their part, 
<br>continue to seek to keep the issue alive. Marty declared to 
<br>the press December 13 that he found the allegations of U.S. 
<br>renditions credible, even if he allowed that it was still too 
<br>early "to assert that there had been any involvement or 
<br>complicity of (CoE) member states in illegal actions.". He 
<br>publicly chastised the U.S. for failing to provide any 
<br>"information or explanations," putting aside any mention of 
<br>the Secretary's December 5 statement on the controversy (ref 
<br>c), which was provided to Marty under a cover letter from 
<br>Ambassador Stapleton on December 7. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) For any number of reasons, including some that may 
<br>have more to do with institutional rivalries rather than the 
<br>issue at hand, van der Linden and Marty appear to have 
<br>decided to take a much more confrontational, public approach 
<br>than Davis on the renditions issue. The result is that, 
<br>whatever their motivations, the renditions issue appears 
<br>likely to stay on the front burner. The PACE Committee on 
<br>Legal Affairs and Human Rights announced December 13 that it 
<br>will ask the PACE to schedule debate on the issue at the 
<br>January 23-27 plenary session. End Comment.
