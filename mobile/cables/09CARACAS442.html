<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Francisco Fernandez, 
<br>Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Embassy Caracas notes a significant number 
<br>of Cuban medical personnel applying to be paroled into the 
<br>United States under the Significant Public Benefit Parole 
<br>(SPBP) for Cuban Medical Professionals outside of Cuba 
<br>(CMPP). During Consular Section interviews in March, Cuban 
<br>Medical personnel affiliated with Chavez's Barrio Adentro 
<br>program complained of poor working conditions, inadequate 
<br>medical supplies, and of constantly being watched and 
<br>monitored by coworkers. As result of the Government of the 
<br>Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (GBRV) clamp down on Cubans 
<br>attempting to flee the island through Venezuela, recent 
<br>asylum seekers have complained of having difficulty in 
<br>exiting Venezuela and being forced to pay exorbitant bribes 
<br>to GBRV officials when attempting to leave the country 
<br>en-route to Miami. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>CUBANS DOCTORS FLEE VENEZUELA 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) The Consular Section at US Embassy Caracas began 
<br>accepting applications for SPBP on August 18, 2006. To date, 
<br>the Embassy has received paperwork and forwarded to the 
<br>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) applications for 739 
<br>Cuban asylum seekers, of which 69% or 510 were approved, 91 
<br>were denied and 138 are pending. Since February of 2009, DHS 
<br>has notified Post that 73 Cuban Medical Personnel Program 
<br>(CMPP) applicants have been approved for parole through the 
<br>CMPP. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) In 2006 and 2007 Embassy Caracas facilitated travel 
<br>to Miami for program applicants through the issuance of 
<br>transportation letters authorizing Cubans to board US bound 
<br>aircraft. By October 2007, Venezuelan immigration officials 
<br>began refusing to board defecting Cubans on onward flights to 
<br>Miami in an unpredictable and ad-hoc manner. To enhance 
<br>fraud protection due to insecurity of the travel letter, (one 
<br>letter was used by an imposture), Post sought and received CA 
<br>approval to issue YY visa foils instead of transportation 
<br>letters. Having a visa foil in their passports has 
<br>facilitated the departure of most parolees. The Consular 
<br>Section began issuing YY visa foils in February 2009 to 
<br>approved Cuban Medical Parolees. Of the 73 approved CMPP 
<br>applicants in 2009, 43 have been issued YY visa foils, 39 
<br>have successfully passed through immigration and boarded 
<br>their flight to Miami, and two have confirmed plans to travel 
<br>in the near future. Thirty approved applicants have not yet 
<br>confirmed travel plans because they currently are unable to 
<br>travel, do not have the financial resources to leave 
<br>Venezuela, or have been forced to return to Cuba. Two 
<br>applicants were unsuccessful in their attempt to leave 
<br>Venezuela from the Barcelona (Venezuela) airport. Note: Most 
<br>CMPP applicants departing from the Caracas airport have been 
<br>successful in boarding their flight to Miami. Following the 
<br>approval of parole by DHS, CMPP applicants must enter the US 
<br>within 60 days. End Note. 
<br>

<br>CUBAN MEDICS CLAIM MISTREATMENT 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The majority of the CMPP applicants interviewed by 
<br>Post were originally conscripted to work in social programs 
<br>such as Mission Barrio Adentro, a GBRV sponsored program that 
<br>provides health care to city slums and rural communities, or 
<br>similar GBRV poverty reduction programs in medicine, sports, 
<br>and the arts. In its annual 2008 report, the Caracas based 
<br>human rights NGO PROVEA estimated that 14,345 Cuban medical 
<br>professionals were originally assigned to work in Venezuela 
<br>following the inauguration of Barrio Adentro in December 
<br>¶2003. Currently only about 8,500 Cubans are estimated to be 
<br>employed in social programs across the country. While some 
<br>CMPP applicants told Consular officials they volunteered to 
<br>come to Venezuela, many others have complained of being 
<br>forced (or directed) by Cuban authorities to work in 
<br>Venezuela under President Chavez's social mission programs 
<br>for a period of 1-3 years. 
<br>
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000442 002.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Many CMPP applicants have reported that upon arrival 
<br>in Venezuela, Barrio Adentro Mission officials have 
<br>confiscated the passports of program participants to prevent 
<br>their fleeing the mission. According to one applicant who 
<br>was interviewed on January 27, 2009, the coordinator of the 
<br>Cuban medical mission (Barrio Adentro 2, Aragua state) had 
<br>been holding his and his other colleagues' passports since 
<br>April 2008, when another Cuban had abandoned the mission, as 
<br>a "means of preventing other desertions." The applicant did 
<br>not receive his passport back until he went on a scheduled 
<br>vacation in September 2008 to Cuba. Upon his return to 
<br>Venezuela in October 2008 he was not required by mission 
<br>authorities to turn over his passport a second time. The 
<br>CMPP applicant received Significant Public Benefit Parole on 
<br>March 2, 2009, was issued a YY visa foil, successfully fled 
<br>Venezuela, and arrived in Miami on March 16, 2009. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) During Consular section interviews in March, Cuban 
<br>medical personnel affiliated with Chavez's Barrio Adentro 
<br>program complained of extremely poor working conditions, low 
<br>pay, limited medical supplies, and of constantly being 
<br>watched and monitored by co-workers. According to one doctor 
<br>who successfully fled on March 10, "All the effort I put into 
<br>my work is not recognized by anyone... I am not well paid and 
<br>only make 715 BsF (332 USD) a month in Venezuela, I want to 
<br>change my life." The doctor told Consular Officers that he 
<br>is forced to attend to 250-300 patients a week and "can only 
<br>use obsolete and inferior Cuban medicine". A rehabilitation 
<br>therapist who successfully fled on March 16 opined, "I feel 
<br>politically manipulated. The system is closing my chances 
<br>and I want to be a better professional. I have a lack of 
<br>equipment and medicine in my job. I want to be a free man. 
<br>I want to be a surgeon specialist." On March 30 one CMPP 
<br>applicant, who managed to escape his mission for several 
<br>hours and was clearly anxious to return before his supervisor 
<br>realized he was gone, told Poloff "They are always watching 
<br>us, checking in with us at random times, asking what we are 
<br>doing and calling us on our cell phones." While noting that 
<br>he has not received any physical threats so far during his 
<br>time in Venezuela, he commented "It is a psychological battle 
<br>that we must endure every day." 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>CORRUPTION, DESPERATION, GBRV CLAMP DOWN 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) The Government of the Bolivarian Republic of 
<br>Venezuela (GBRV) began clamping down on Cubans attempting to 
<br>flee the island via Venezuela in 2007. While many applicants 
<br>have successfully fled Cuba through Venezuela, others have 
<br>been detained upon attempting to depart and presumably 
<br>deported to Cuba. Recent asylum seekers have complained of 
<br>having to pay exorbitant bribes (usually around 1,000 USD) to 
<br>Venezuelan customs officials when attempting to exit the 
<br>country en-route to Miami. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) As recently as March 24 a Cuban couple attempted to 
<br>board a flight from Barcelona (Venezuela) to Miami after the 
<br>US Embassy issued YY visa foils for their onward travel. The 
<br>couple paid over 4,600 USD to "a contact" to assist them in 
<br>clearing GBRV immigration. After their flight was delayed and 
<br>a shift change occurred at the airport, the couple was 
<br>questioned by Venezuelan immigration authorities who turned 
<br>them over to the National Guard. The military later 
<br>contacted Cuban officials. The couple was eventually moved 
<br>to a hotel by Cuban "security" and told they would be 
<br>deported to Cuba. The CMPP applicants later escaped their 
<br>captors and fled to the US Embassy, where a local contact 
<br>picked them up and reportedly took them into hiding. The 
<br>traumatized couple told US Consular officers the Cuban 
<br>"police" who detained them were also "Barrio Adentro Mission 
<br>officials". According to the female CMPP applicant, the 
<br>"Cuban police" threatened to rape her and beat up her 
<br>boyfriend. Note: Recent CMPP applicants have reported to 
<br>Consular Officers that after leaving Barrio Adentro, 
<br>occasionally some Venezuelans are willing to help Cubans who 
<br>are in hiding. Little is known about the individuals who 
<br>assist Cuban medical personnel once they abandon Chavez's 
<br>"missions." End Note. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Comment: Due to the risk CMPP applicants have of 
<br>being stopped by GBRV authorities prior to boarding Miami 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000442 003.2 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>bound aircraft, some Cuban parolees have considered (or are 
<br>considering) undertaking a cross border overland trip to 
<br>Bogota. While Post does not advise parolees on which route 
<br>(if any) is less risky, the issuance of YY visa foils by Post 
<br>has reduced the probability of GBRV immigration officials 
<br>detecting a parolee prior to his or her departure. Post 
<br>believes, however, that it is only a matter of time before 
<br>GBRV immigration officials become alert to the YY visa foils 
<br>and are able to further tighten the GBRV's clamp down on 
<br>Cubans planning to abandon the social missions and flee the 
<br>country. With the February approval of 73 applicants by DHS, 
<br>(over 25 applicants have been issued YY visa foils in the 
<br>past two weeks alone), and more cases pending approval, Post 
<br>continues to meet the demand of Cuban medical personnel 
<br>hoping to flee Venezuela rather than face the prospect of 
<br>returning to Cuba. End Comment.<br>
