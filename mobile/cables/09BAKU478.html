<br>Summary
<br>--------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) "Iran view from Baku" is the first in an occasional
<br>series from Embassy Baku Iran Watcher that will report on
<br>short and/or partially documented items of interest to Iran
<br>information consumers, but not necessarily warranting
<br>separate cables. This cable includes information on reported
<br>increasing security problems in Iranian Baluchistan,
<br>including alleged disruption of Iran-Pakistan railroad links;
<br>a message from a senior GOAJ military offical about the
<br>dangers of stirring up Iranian minorities; the apparent
<br>quadrupling in first quarter 2009 (compared to first quarter
<br>2008) seizures in Azerbaijan of Iranian- transited heroin;
<br>and skepticism about Iranian gas export contracts, related by
<br>industry participants at the recently-completed Baku Oil and
<br>Gas show. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Baluchi Violence Obstructing Iran-Pakistan Rail Link?
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Several Iranian contacts, including apolitical
<br>businessmen, have told Baku Iran watcher that the recent
<br>suicide bombing of a Sh'ia mosque, and subsequent attack on a
<br>campaign center in Zahedan, reflect a surge in Baluchi
<br>violence in the border area and inside Pakistan that has been
<br>building steadily over several years. According to one
<br>source, the Iranian security forces may be losing effective
<br>control over growing areas in the countryside. All noted
<br>that the rising violence in Iranian Baluchistan is mirrored
<br>and influenced by similar events on the Pakistani side of the
<br>border (recently described in ref(a)).
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) One alleged result is the apparent postponement of
<br>completion of the long-planned improved rail link between
<br>Pakistan and Iran, designed to run through or near Baluchi
<br>territory on both sides of the border. The current rail
<br>connection, running between Quetta, Pakistan and Zahedan,
<br>Iran is in poor condition and has low freight-carrying
<br>capacity. Moreover, according to reports it has recently
<br>been repeatedly subject to rocket attacks and other
<br>disruption by Baluchi tribes. An improved link also
<br>traversing Iranian and Pakistani Baluchi areas was originally
<br>supposed to have been inaugurated in March, 2009, with
<br>container train service beginning in August. According to
<br>Iranian sources in Baku, this deadline is unlikely to be
<br>achieved, and regular use of the Iran-Pakistan railway for
<br>significant cargo shipment is unlikely in the foreseeable
<br>future.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) xxxxxxxxxxxx quoted the Ministry source as saying that in
<br>2008 Iran asked Pakistan to establish a new, "more secure and
<br>modern" route, but that Pakistan has so far refused. The
<br>source added that Tehran is rife with rumors about the
<br>increasing lack of safety in Baluchi areas, and claimed that
<br>many guard and police posts in Sistan-Baluchistan areas are
<br>no longer occupied at night due to the increased danger of
<br>attack.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Another source, xxxxxxxxxxxx blamed the Ahmadinejad
<br>administration for pursuing provocative anti-Sunni practices
<br>(including harassment of Sunni clergy and congregations and
<br>raids on Sunni mosques) and other "arrogant" crackdowns over
<br>the last few years. He claimed that these practices,
<br>combined with high unemployment, perceived discrimination,

<br>
<br>and few government services, has increased anger among
<br>Baluchis, and identification of the central government as an
<br>"enemy." He cited the appointment of Ahmadinejad ally
<br>Habibullah Dehmordah as a Governor of Sistan-Baluchistan as a
<br>typical insensitive blunder, calling him a "stupid, brutal,
<br>Sunni-hater." (Note: Dehmordah was replaced as Governor in
<br>2008 by Ali-Mohammed Azad. End Note).
<br>
<br>GOAJ Military Figure Opposes Promoting Unrest in Iran
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) At a 12 May meeting with a visiting group of 16 U.S.
<br>military general officers, the GOAJ's Special Assistant to
<br>the President for Defense, General Vahid Aliyev, related that
<br>he had recently met in Iranian Azerbaijan with (unnamed)
<br>high-ranking &Iranian General.8 Although he did not
<br>provide details, Aliyev strongly implied that the Iranian
<br>General raised alleged "foreign-sponsored" efforts to foment
<br>unrest among Iranian ethnic groups, including Iranian
<br>Azerbaijanis (who make up nearly thirty percent of the
<br>Iranian population). Commenting on this issue, Aliyev
<br>asserted that "there have been four attempts by Iranian
<br>Azerbaijanis to assert autonomy in the last hundred years,
<br>all of which were crushed" by the Iranian state. As an
<br>example, Aliyev cited the Soviet effort during World War II
<br>to establish a breakaway "Republic of South Azerbaijan." The
<br>Soviets forces pulled back in 1946, after a "Truman-Stalin
<br>Agreement," which Aliyev depicted as a cynical "betrayal" of
<br>collaborating Iranian Azerbaijanis. He recounted that the
<br>resulting repression by Tehran resulted in the deaths of
<br>60,000 Azeris, and the flight of many more into Soviet
<br>Azerbaijan.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) U.S. military participants agreed that Aliyev
<br>appeared to be implicitly signaling that outside fomenting of
<br>unrest in Iranian Azerbaijan is opposed by the GOAJ. Aliyev
<br>similarly told the U.S. officers that any foreign war with
<br>Iran will be bad for Azerbaijan, and result in a flood of
<br>refugees entering the country. (Note: The three other
<br>"failed Azerbaijani autonomy struggles" cited by Aliyev
<br>presumably refer to the early 20th century Constitutional
<br>Revolution, Azerbaijani resistance to Reza Shah's
<br>centralization policies in the 1920's, and efforts by senior
<br>Azerbaijani clerics and activists to obtain local autonomy in
<br>the wake of the Islamic Revolution in 1979. End note).
<br>
<br>GOAJ Iran-Origin Heroin Seizures Continue Rise
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) According to xxxxxxxxxxxx, export of narcotics from Iran
<br>into Azerbaijan continue to skyrocket (see ref b). According
<br>to statistics provided to Baku Iran watcher xxxxxxxxxxxx, Iran-origin heroin seizures (i.e.,
<br>heroin derived from Afghani and Pakistani opium that entered
<br>Azerbaijan from Iran) in Azerbaijan nearly quadrupled during
<br>the first quarter of 2009, as compared to the first quarter
<br>of 2008. According to the GOAJ, virtually all of this heroin
<br>had been fully processed in labs and was "ready for market."
<br>Total heroin seizures in Azerbaijan during the first quarter
<br>of 2008 reflected a sharp increase over the first quarter of
<br>2007; while in 2006 only twenty kilograms of such heroin was
<br>officially reported seized in Azerbaijan during the entire
<br>year. In contrast, reported GOAJ seizures of Iran-origin
<br>heroin during the first quarter of 2009 amounted to nearly
<br>59,000 kilos, as compared to approximately 15,000 kilos of
<br>heroin seized in the first quarter of 2008.
<br>
<br>Projected Problems in Iranian Gas Links
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The annual Baku Oil and Gas Show, held June 2-5,
<br>brought a variety of energy company executives and pundits to
<br>Baku, though no senior officials from Iran. An American
<br>

<br>SUBJECT: IRAN VIEW FROM BAKU: VIOLENCE IN BALUCHISTAN REDUCING BORDER SECURITY; GOAJ OFFICIAL WARNS AGAINST MANIPULATION OF IRAN’S MINORITIES; IRAN TRANSIT-ORIGIN HEROIN SEIZURES RISE; ALLEGED PROBLEMS WITH IRANIAN GAS EXPORT DEALS 
<br>
<br>interlocutor told Baku Iran Watcher on the side of the show
<br>that xxxxxxxxxxxx had confided to him in a private conversation xxxxxxxxxxxx that he viewed near-term implementation of the
<br>Iranian-Pakistani gas link project as "very unlikely." The
<br>downbeat comment by the xxxxxxxxxxxx was
<br>made despite the recent signing in Istanbul by President
<br>Ahmadinejad and President Zardari of an Iranian-Pakistani MOU
<br>committing to the gas project. According to this source, xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>indicated that he had several reasons for this
<br>opinion, but the only one he elaborated was that "the
<br>Pakistanis don't have the money to pay for either the
<br>pipeline, or the gas."
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Meanwhile, during a panel discussion at the
<br>conference on the future prospects of Caspian gas, several
<br>commentators noted the difficulty of doing business in
<br>"unpredictable, overly bureaucratic" Iran, and the alleged
<br>historical "unreliability" of Iranian gas supply contracts
<br>previously reached with Turkey and Turkmenistan. For
<br>example, panelists recounted that, after long negotiations,
<br>Iran has four times failed to sign separate Liquid national
<br>Gas contracts at the last minute. Two panelists claimed that
<br>Iran has repeatedly diverted gas supplies to meet domestic
<br>needs, thereby interrupting its contractual gas exports - and
<br>has not paid contractual penalties for these violations.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C)  xxxxxxxxxxxx  asserted bluntly that Iranian
<br>political leaders are totally focused on domestic needs and
<br>personal jockeying, and are simply not interested in hearing
<br>about the value of optimizing foreign gas exports. The only
<br>exception, he claimed, is their interest in the notional
<br>prospect of annually exporting ten billion cubic meters
<br>(bcms) of gas to Europe. He attributed this interest to a
<br>conviction that such a deal will significantly increase
<br>Iran's political leverage in Europe and substantially
<br>insulate it from future European pressure - a perception he
<br>characterized as revealing, and "typically" unrealistic.
