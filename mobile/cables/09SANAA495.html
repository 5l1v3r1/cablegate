<br>SUMMARY
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) President Saleh on March 16 rejected a proposal by
<br>visiting Assistant to the President and Deputy National
<br>Security Advisor (APDNSA) John Brennan that Yemeni Guantanamo
<br>detainees be sent to a Saudi rehabilitation center jointly
<br>run by Saudi Arabia and Yemen.  Saleh instead insisted that
<br>the Yemeni detainees be returned to Yemen as soon as a
<br>proposed rehabilitation center in Aden, funded by the U.S.
<br>and Saudi Arabia, is ready to accept them.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>SALEH INTRANSIGENT ON DETAINEES
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) President Saleh on March 16 repeatedly rebuffed
<br>suggestions by visiting APDNSA John Brennan that Yemeni
<br>Guantanamo detainees be sent to Saudi Arabia, insisting on a
<br>Saudi-style rehabilitation center inside Yemen, funded by the
<br>U.S. and Saudi Arabia.  Brennan, accompanied by the
<br>Ambassador, NSC Director John Duncan, S/WCI Ambassador Clint
<br>Williamson, and Pol/Mil Chief, told Saleh that the U.S.
<br>wanted detainees to return to Yemen eventually.  In the
<br>absence of a Yemeni program, however, the best near-term
<br>solution was for Saudi Arabia and Yemen to jointly run a
<br>program, at a Saudi-built rehabilitation facility at Abha in
<br>KSA with an immediate capability of receiving up to 120
<br>detainees and open to Arabs from across the region.  Saleh
<br>refused to address this suggestion directly, saying Yemen
<br>would build its own rehabilitation center in Aden.  "We will
<br>offer the land in Aden, and you and the Saudis will provide
<br>the funding."  It will be ready 90 days after receipt of the
<br>USD 11 million required for construction, Saleh said.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Growing increasingly impatient, Saleh said that the
<br>U.S. could duplicate the Saudi program in Yemen.  Brennan
<br>responded that such a program takes time to develop and that
<br>Saleh had his hands full dealing with al-Qaeda in Yemen.
<br>Saleh said that while he personally had no problem with
<br>detainees being sent to KSA, Yemeni opposition parties are
<br>the real obstacle because they will not allow him to give KSA
<br>control over Yemeni citizens.  Brennan told Saleh that a
<br>leader of his depth of experience could surely figure out a
<br>way to deal with the opposition,s concerns.  Saleh asked why
<br>the U.S. didn,t simply keep the detainees at Guantanamo or
<br>send them to the "Moayad prison" while Yemen builds its own
<br>facility.  (Note: Saleh was referring to the federal prison
<br>in Colorado where convicted Yemeni terrorist financier
<br>Mohammed al-Moayad is currently being held.  End Note.)
<br>Signaling his bottom line, Saleh told Brennan that Yemen
<br>already had plans for a rehabilitation center and repeated
<br>his demand that the U.S. and KSA fund it.  At this point,
<br>Brennan asked to speak with Saleh and the Ambassador
<br>privately.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) In the pull-aside with Brennan and the Ambassador,
<br>Saleh said that he wouldn,t object if the U.S. and Saudi
<br>Arabia entered into a bilateral agreement regarding
<br>disposition of the Guantanamo detainees.  (Comment: Saleh
<br>said this knowing full well that the Saudis are unwilling at
<br>this point to take in the Yemeni detainees without his
<br>concurrence.  End Comment.)  In a brief meeting outside
<br>Saleh's gazebo, Ambassador Williamson described to Saleh's
<br>nephew, Deputy Director of the National Security Bureau (NSB)
<br>Ammar Saleh, the USG's review process for evaluating possible
<br>destinations for detainees and praised the Saudi program.
<br>Ambassador Williamson said that Saudi Arabia was closer to
<br>Yemen than Guantanamo and that if the Saudi solution didn't
<br>work, then the Yemenis would be transfered to other
<br>countries, but not to Yemen.  Ammar proposed sending the
<br>Yemenis to the ROYG facility for a brief (e.g. 3 month)
<br>period at which time Saleh could announce that they had asked
<br>to be transferred to KSA, and it would be done.  He cautioned
<br>that he had not yet proposed the idea to Saleh and that any
<br>such transfers would have to be approved by both the family
<br>and the tribes involved.  Ambassador Williamson thanked Ammar
<br>Saleh for his suggestion and said he would take it up with
<br>Mr. Brennan, but noted that he did not think it was a viable
<br>alternative given the caveats imposed.
<br>
<br>RETURN OF THE BAATH IN IRAQ??
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) In a bizarre postscript to the morning meeting with
<br>Saleh, the Palace protocol office called an hour later to
<br>request that Brennan meet with Ammar Saleh.  Expecting a
<br>continuation of the Guantanamo detainee discussion, the
<br>Brennan delegation and the Ambassador met with Saleh, who
<br>said that he had been instructed by the President to share
<br>"very important" intelligence information with Brennan.
<br>Ammar said the NSB had what it considered reliable
<br>information that the Iraqi Baath party was reconstituting
<br>itself and would reclaim power in Baghdad once the U.S.
<br>pulled out.  Upon hearing this, Brennan ended the meeting,
<br>telling Ammar that he had come expecting to discuss detainee
<br>issues, and that he would report to President Obama his
<br>disappointment that the ROYG was being inflexible in dealing
<br>with the issue.  In a final twist, the protocol office called
<br>to say that Ammar Saleh would meet Mr. Brennan at the airport
<br>as he departed Yemen (raising again the possibility that
<br>there could be further discussion of the detainee issue) only
<br>to call back to say Ammar Saleh had been called away to
<br>another meeting.
<br>
<br>ROYG SPIN AND EMBASSY PRESS STATEMENT
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Official news agency Saba released a statement after
<br>the meeting saying that Saleh had called on the U.S. to
<br>"extradite" Yemeni citizens at Guantanamo to Yemen so they
<br>could be rehabilitated and integrated into society.  The Saba
<br>statement also noted that Brennan had delivered a letter from
<br>President Obama praising Yemen's efforts in counterterrorism
<br>and that Saleh had given Brennan a response letter for
<br>President Obama.  (Note: Brennan did deliver a letter from
<br>President Obama, but the letter focused on the danger of
<br>transfering detainees directly to Yemen.  Contrary to the
<br>Saba statement, Saleh did not give Brennan a letter for
<br>President Obama.  End Note.)
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) The Embassy issued the following press release,
<br>cleared by Brennan, the afternoon of March 16.
<br>
<br>Begin Embassy press release text:
<br>
<br>John Brennan, Assistant to the President and Deputy National
<br>Security Advisor, visited Yemen on March 16, 2009 as part of
<br>a visit to the region to discuss continued cooperation
<br>between the United States and Yemen in combating terrorism.
<br>As part of the ongoing dialogue between Yemen and the United
<br>States regarding the remaining Yemeni detainees at
<br>Guantanamo, Mr. Brennan raised with President Ali Abdullah
<br>Saleh the U.S. Government's concerns about the direct return
<br>of detainees to Yemen.
<br>
<br>End Embassy press release text.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) To say Saleh missed a good chance to engage the new
<br>Administration on one of its key foreign policy priorities
<br>would be a severe understatement.  He appeared alternately
<br>dismissive, bored, and impatient during the 40-minute
<br>meeting.  Saleh's knowledge that Saudi Arabia will not accept
<br>Yemeni detainees without at least tacit support from Saleh
<br>has likely emboldened the ROYG to press publicly and
<br>privately for an all-or-nothing push for the direct transfer
<br>of detainees to Yemen.  Saleh clearly feels that he has the
<br>better hand in any negotiations on the issue.  He may have
<br>concluded that, if he holds out long enough, the USG will
<br>eventually acquiesce to his demands because of the
<br>Administration's timeline for closing Guantanamo in spite of
<br>Mr. Brennan's clear message that the USG is actively seeking
<br>alternatives.  End Comment.
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) APDNSA Brennan cleared this cable.  S/WCI Ambassador
<br>Williamson did not have the opportunity to clear this cable.
