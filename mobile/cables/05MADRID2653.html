<br>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S MEETING WITH PRESIDENT ZAPATERO 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre; reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary.  Ambassador Aguirre had his first meeting 
<br>with President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero on July 12 to 
<br>introduce himself and to review the USG roadmap for improving 
<br>bilateral relations.  The 90-minute meeting was cordial and 
<br>relaxed throughout and covered a broad range of bilateral and 
<br>regional issues.  The Ambassador said he would use his 
<br>position to speak frequently and directly to the people of 
<br>Spain regarding America's interests through extensive travel 
<br>and media access.  Zapatero said Spain wants a good 
<br>relationship with the USG.  He said he had long gotten past 
<br>his opposition to the war in Iraq and was focused on 
<br>supporting Iraqi reconstruction.  The Ambassador said that 
<br>the USG had also moved beyond the dispute over Iraq and 
<br>looked forward to positive GOS actions and statements in 
<br>support of Iraqi reconstruction.  President Zapatero focused 
<br>much of his discussion on Latin America, emphasizing the 
<br>importance Spain placed on protecting its investments in this 
<br>increasingly politically unsettled region.  He said Spain had 
<br>pressed Venezuela to improve its behavior, both domestically 
<br>and at the regional level, but said regional leaders had 
<br>counseled him on the need to avoid "isolating" Chavez.  The 
<br>Ambassador expressed appreciation for Spain's recent 
<br>statement supporting Venezuelan NGO "Sumate" against GOV 
<br>legal action and said the USG hoped Spain would use private 
<br>and public pressure to move Venezuela in a positive 
<br>direction.  Zapatero defended Spanish policy towards Cuba, 
<br>saying it was imperitive for the GOS to establish ties with 
<br>Castro's likely successors.  Zapatero noted the importance of 
<br>North Africa for Spain, particularly since many of the 
<br>terrorist suspects active in Spain are from Morocco.  This 
<br>was an excellent first encounter with President Zapatero that 
<br>allowed the Ambassador to underline the USG's interest in 
<br>moving forward on a positive agenda.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) The Ambassador and DCM met with President Zapatero and 
<br>National Security Adviser Carles Casajuana in the the 
<br>Presidential Palace.  The Ambassador thanked Zapatero for the 
<br>warm welcome provided by Spanish officials, particularly in 
<br>arranging his early accreditation and a series of meetings 
<br>with key leaders and cabinet officials during his first three 
<br>weeks in Spain.  Zapatero welcomed the Ambassador and 
<br>emphasized his desire to have good relations with the U.S. 
<br>Though Zapatero sometimes has a tendency to interrupt other 
<br>speakers and to dominate conversations, in this meeting he 
<br>was very engaging and listened attentively to the 
<br>Ambassador's points. 
<br> 
<br>//BILATERAL RELATIONS// 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Zapatero said that Iraq was clearly at the root of the 
<br>bilateral disagreements that had taken place over the last 
<br>year and, while he had disagreed with the U.S. intervention, 
<br>he had moved past these differences and wanted to focus on 
<br>the rebuilding of a stable, democratic Iraq.  He said Spain 
<br>would continue to cooperate financially with in this effort. 
<br>Zapatero then reviewed key areas of mutual interest, saying 
<br>the U.S. and Spain could disagree on certain issues, but that 
<br>his government would raise any differences in a sincere, 
<br>transparent, and friendly manner.  On counter terrorism, an 
<br>area of good U.S.-Spain cooperation, he said that jihadists 
<br>were clearly active in Spain and expressed concern that 
<br>Spain-based extremists may have had a role in the London 
<br>subway/bus attacks.  He said Spain would continue to 
<br>cooperate with the USG on terrorism finance issues.  Zapatero 
<br>noted his government's efforts to build a strong 
<br>counter-terrorism relationship with Morocco and to ease 
<br>Moroccan-Algerian tensions, iniatives he saw as dovetailing 
<br>with USG objectives in North Africa.  He said that Spain also 
<br>desired a good U.S.-EU relationship and pointed to President 
<br>Bush's speech in Brussels as a clear indication of a similar 
<br>desire on the part of the USG.  Zapatero highlighted Spain's 
<br>good investment climate and urged greater U.S. investment. 
<br>He said Spain wanted to increase its engagement with the 
<br>growing Hispanic community in the U.S.  Zapatero said Spain's 
<br>solid economic growth generated sufficient revenues for the 
<br>GOS to contribute to development efforts in many regions. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) The Ambassador said that the USG also desired a good 
<br>relationship with Spain.  He said that he would act as the 
<br>face and voice of President Bush in Spain and stressed the 
<br>importance of building confidence and credibility between 
<br>himself and GOS officials.  The Ambassador said he would 
<br>speak frequently and directly to the people of Spain 
<br>regarding America's interests through extensive travel and 
<br>broad media access.  He noted his extensive experience in 
<br>Latin America, as a government executive, and as a 
<br>businessman.  The Ambassador said the USG had gotten past the 
<br>withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq, but it had proven 
<br>more difficult to get past the negative GOS rhetoric that had 
<br>followed the withdrawal.  What the USG hoped for now was 
<br>positive Spanish action and public statements on Iraq and on 
<br>other issues important to the USG, such as the need for 
<br>democratic reforms in the Broader Middle East and North 
<br>Africa.  The Ambassador said he also wanted to hear from GOS 
<br>officials to learn more about Spanish policy in North Africa, 
<br>which was important to the USG, but was obviously an even 
<br>greater priority for Madrid. 
<br> 
<br>//LATIN AMERICA// 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) President Zapatero discussed Spain's important and 
<br>growing interests in Latin America, noting that extensive 
<br>Spanish investment in the region meant that Spain would 
<br>suffer economically from any downturn or instability there. 
<br>He reviewed political conditions in Argentina, Bolivia, 
<br>Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, and Central America.  He made clear 
<br>that Spanish business interests would generally trump 
<br>political considerations on any given country or issue. 
<br>Zapatero appeared particularly concerned regarding the threat 
<br>to Spanish investments in Bolivia's oil and gas industry.  He 
<br>said Spain thought Mesa had been a good leader and worried 
<br>about the surge in indigenous group unrest and populist 
<br>leaders.  On Brazil, he said the GOS was troubled by 
<br>President Lula's recent difficulties since it undermined Lula 
<br>as a symbol of a democratic alternative to the populist 
<br>message driven by others in the region.  Zapatero cited the 
<br>lack of development in Central America as particularly 
<br>disappointing for Spain.  The Ambassador discussed USG 
<br>efforts to win support for CAFTA as indicative of similar 
<br>U.S. concerns in Central America.  Zapatero said Spain was 
<br>providing judicial assistance to Colombia and other countries 
<br>and planned to strengthen judicial cooperation throughout the 
<br>region in the course of the Ibero American Summit in 
<br>Salamanca, Spain in October. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) On Venezuela, Zapatero said Spain's policy of 
<br>engagement with the GOV was based on advice from regional 
<br>leaders not to isolate Chavez.  The Ambassador said USG 
<br>policy was not aimed at isolating Chavez, but we had to be 
<br>realistic and do everything possible to keep him from 
<br>exporting his populist, anti-democratic model.  In that 
<br>sense, Zapatero's attentions gave Chavez a legitimacy that he 
<br>might otherwise lack.  The Ambassador said the USG very much 
<br>appreciated the recent GOS statements critical of GOV action 
<br>against Venezuelan NGO "Sumate," and expected that Spain 
<br>would continue to use both public statements and private 
<br>influence to move Venezuela in the right direction.  Zapatero 
<br>said Spain had pressed Chavez to improve relations with 
<br>Colombia and urged Venezuela to institute strict controls on 
<br>the AK-47 assault rifles purchased from Russia. 
<br> 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>//NORTH AFRICA// 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Zapatero said that increased development and 
<br>integration in North Africa were important for all of Europe, 
<br>but especially for Spain.  He cited the lack of economic 
<br>growth in the region combined with increased radicalization 
<br>within disenfranchised populations as major risks to Spanish 
<br>security.  Zapatero said that Morocco was the point of origin 
<br>for most terrorist suspects active in Spain and that this 
<br>factor alone made increased cooperation with Rabat a crucial 
<br>objective for the GOS.  He said King Mohamed was deeply 
<br>concerned about terrorism and had pressed for greater 
<br>security cooperation with Spain on the part of Moroccan 
<br>security agencies.  Zapatero said this would also serve USG 
<br>interests in the fight against terrorism. 
<br> 
<br>//"THE EU IS SET"// 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Zapatero said that the current internal EU discord 
<br>would not stop forward progress; fundamentally, "the EU is 
<br>set," regardless of any bumps on the road to further 
<br>integration.  He said this fact obviated the long-running 
<br>internal debate in Spain over whether to pursue an 
<br>ever-greater European identity or maintain a more independent 
<br>national character.
