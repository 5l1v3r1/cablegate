<br>¶C. MOSCOW 147
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador William J. Burns. Reasons 1.4 (B/D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. After many last-minute changes and
<br>rescheduling involving Tymoshenko's visit, the February 12-13
<br>Putin-Yushchenko Intergovernmental Commission (IGC) convened
<br>without Tymoshenko's participation. GOR officials expressed
<br>dismay at the complicated dynamics between Yushchenko and
<br>Tymoshenko, which required "delicate balancing" on its part.
<br>The IGC session focused on an action plan for all areas of
<br>the bilateral relationship for 2008, while two sensitive
<br>issues -- NATO and gas -- loomed large. A recent series of
<br>small-scale disagreements have also added to the friction.
<br>Compounded by the Yushchenko- Tymoshenko feud, the
<br>on-again-off-again gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is
<br>continuing, with Gazprom threatening another cut-off unless
<br>the debt is paid by March 3. Moscow analysts view bilateral
<br>relations as hostage to Ukrainian domestic political games,
<br>where different forces vie for a better position in next
<br>year's presidential election through attempts to gain an
<br>upper hand over deals with Russia. End summary.
<br>
<br>Yushchenko-Tymoshenko "Farce"
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Yushchenko made two visits to Moscow within two weeks
<br>this month, for the February 12-13 IGC meeting, where he met
<br>bilaterally with Putin, and the February 21-22 CIS Informal
<br>Summit, where he did not (ref A). Yushchenko's travel was
<br>punctuated by PM Tymoshenko's many-times-delayed visit.xxxxx, 
<br>told us February 26 that the uneasy dynamics
<br>between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko complicated the IGC
<br>proceedings. He termed the situation "disappointing" at best
<br>and "bewildering" otherwise. Tymoshenko, whose February 11
<br>visit, one day before Yushchenko's to avoid the overlap with
<br>him, was delayed till February 21 at Ukraine's request and
<br>then was moved forward by one day for the same reason.
<br>xxxxx said that GOR officials simply could not understand
<br>how the president and prime minister of a country could work
<br>effectively under such odd circumstances.xxxxx, the
<br>GOR's goal was to conduct a meaningful dialogue with the
<br>Ukrainian counterparts in all six commissions without making
<br>the already delicate situation worse. The GOR, which had
<br>prepared for Tymoshenko's participation in the IGC, had to
<br>match the Ukrainian decision not to include her in its team
<br>by pulling PM Zubkov from the session.
<br>
<br>Putin-Yushchenko Bilateral
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The two presidents, during their three-hour long
<br>"good" discussion, covered a wide range of bilateral issues,
<br>notably the gas deal, NATO and the dispute over the two
<br>countries' common history. Putin also urged Yushchenko to
<br>take a more active role in the resolution of the Transnistria
<br>conflict.xxxxx that Putin and Yushchenko clashed
<br>over NATO and the GOU's initiatives on Ukrainian national
<br>heroes. Putin was not convinced by Yushchenko's insistence
<br>that Ukraine's request of NATO MAP was not intended to be
<br>anti-Russian.
<br>
<br>NATO: Painful and All Encompassing
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Prior to the Putin-Yushchenko IGC meeting, the GOR
<br>repeatedly expressed its displeasure with Ukraine's NATO bid.
<br>In a January 23 statement on Ukraine's pending request for a
<br>NATO MAP, the MFA warned that further expansion of NATO could
<br>produce a serious political-military upheaval that would
<br>affect the interests of Russia (ref B). Citing the 1997
<br>bilateral agreement laying out the Russian-Ukrainian
<br>strategic partnership, the statement stressed that the
<br>potential integration of Ukraine into NATO would force Russia
<br>to undertake "appropriate measures." During a February 8
<br>meeting with the Ambassador, DFM Karasin said that the GOR
<br>was "disappointed" with the GOU's move (ref C). A positive
<br>decision in Bucharest, Karasin said, would force Russia to
<br>take strategic counter-measures. In his February 14 annual
<br>press conference, Putin lashed out against Ukraine's MAP
<br>request, saying that the majority of Ukrainian citizens were
<br>against their country's NATO membership but Ukrainian leaders
<br>did not ask their opinion, "What kind of democracy is this?"
<br>he asked.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Ukrainian xxxxx told us that Ukraine's interest in closer
<br>
<br>relations with NATO -- for the first time as a consensus
<br>decision by the three top leaders of the country -- had
<br>triggered a "deja-vu reaction" from the GOR, which had
<br>surprised no one in Ukraine, and had provoked a genuine and
<br>more mature public discourse on NATO in Ukraine. Although
<br>the topic was "painful" for Russia and was discussed in every
<br>bilateral meeting on every level, xxxxx argued that
<br>the GOR's response had been to date less emotional than in
<br>the early post-Orange years. xxxxx acknowledged that during
<br>Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary
<br>Bohatyreva's January 29 visit to Moscow, all Russian
<br>interlocutors, including FM Lavrov, Duma Speaker Gryzlov and
<br>other Duma deputies, had expressed hostility to the Ukrainian
<br>move.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Moscow analysts predict that Ukraine's domestic lack
<br>of consensus on membership and the lack of coordinated
<br>support among NATO member states, combined with a slow-moving
<br>NATO bureaucracy, could make the issue a long-term sore spot
<br>in the relationship. Some argued that an "excessive" push by
<br>the GOU could catalyze radical "counter measures" from the
<br>GOR, including a possible re-examination of the status of the
<br>Black Sea Fleet and GOR-funded activities in and around
<br>Sevastopol.
<br>
<br>Gas: Scheming Abounds on Both Sides
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Many viewed the January 24 arrest of Semyon
<br>Mogilevich as only the tip of the iceberg of murky,
<br>high-stakes gas deals, given his alleged involvement with
<br>RosUkrEnergo, which became the key middleman in Russian gas
<br>exports to Ukraine after Russia briefly cut off the gas
<br>supply to Ukraine in January 2006. xxxxx noted that PM
<br>Tymoshenko made the removal of the chain of intermediaries
<br>between Gazprom and Ukraine, as well as raising the gas
<br>transit fee through the Ukrainian territory, the central
<br>theme of her February 20-21 visit. Although Yushchenko and
<br>Tymoshenko shared the same goal of removing intermediary
<br>agents in the gas deal, xxxxx said, the latter insisted on
<br>the immediate removal of RosUkrEnergo from the deal. GOR
<br>officials found her, xxxxx added, inflexible and less
<br>trustworthy than Yushchenko.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) According xxxxx, the GOR was particularly not
<br>pleased with Tymoshenko's idea of the White Stream Pipeline,
<br>considering it another attempt to bypass Russia in bringing
<br>Central Asian gas to Europe. Russia values Ukraine as the
<br>key link to Europe, which can work only if the two countries
<br>are "united" and "consistent," he added. xxxxxtold us
<br>that Putin and Yushchenko talked over the phone on February
<br>26 to discuss Ukraine's growing arrears and the absence of
<br>the 2008 contract. In the meantime, bickering between
<br>Gazprom and Naftogaz is continuing as of February 28 -- just
<br>another sign of the fragility of the energy deal between the
<br>two countries.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) xxxxx said that Yushchenko wanted more
<br>transparency but preferred to avoid measures which would
<br>further increase the price. Moscow Carnegie Center experts
<br>emphasized to us that the GOR's priority is to have Ukraine
<br>as a reliable economic partner, which would guarantee that
<br>Russian gas (mostly Turkmen and Uzbek gas that transits
<br>Russia) would flow to Europe without disruption. All
<br>interlocutors agreed that until Gazprom's leadership
<br>re-shuffle ended, no long-term deal could be made.
<br>
<br>Beyond Gas
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) In 2007, the increase in the volume of bilateral
<br>trade between Russia and Ukraine to USD 32 billion disguised
<br>a decoupling of certain Russian-Ukrainian industries.
<br>According to xxxxx Russia is slowly consolidating the
<br>production cycle to do away with imported parts from Ukraine
<br>in the areas where traditionally the two countries were
<br>interdependent, such as aircraft and machine building. With
<br>Ukraine's aspirations to NATO membership, Russia has already
<br>begun to reduce its cooperation in military and technical
<br>fields, as well. xxxxx said, "The quiet process of
<br>economic disengagement in many important areas is under way."
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Some experts noted that GOR officials are reluctant
<br>to talk about Ukraine's 13-percent plus economic growth in
<br>2007, which -- despite Kyiv's political turmoil -- easily
<br>surpassed Russia's 6 percent. They also argued that WTO entry
<br>could give Ukraine leverage in its dealings with Russia.
<br>They predicted, however, that the new Schengen regime could
<br>hurt Ukraine, particularly in its West, as new members would
<br>replace Ukrainian workers in Western Europe. The rise of
<br>unemployment in western Ukraine could create more disparity
<br>
<br>among Ukrainian regions, giving eastern Ukraine, which is
<br>better incorporated into the Russian economy, an advantage.
<br>
<br>Mazepa: Not Only A Tchaikovskiy Opera
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Ivan Mazepa has recently been added to the long list
<br>of historical figures about whom Russian and Ukraine quarrel.
<br>Since the GOR's pronounced dissatisfaction with the GOU's
<br>attempt to reclassify the Holodomor as genocide, and Roman
<br>Shukevich as a Ukrainian national hero, other cases have
<br>emerged:
<br>
<br>-- the GOU agreed to award political asylum to St. Petersburg
<br>journalist Andrushchenko. Two more Russian journalists have
<br>requested asylum as well.
<br>
<br>-- on February 1, Ukrainian political analyst Serhiy Taran
<br>was barred from entering Russia at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo
<br>airport. The February 5 MFA statement confirmed the incident
<br>without giving a reason for the denial, although it cited the
<br>December 2007 refusal of Ukrainian authorities to grant entry
<br>to Ukraine to two Russian political "analysts" -- Dugin and
<br>Zarifulin.
<br>
<br>-- Ivan Mazepa, portrayed in Pushkin's tale and
<br>Tchaikovskiy's opera as a boorish Ukrainian soldier, who
<br>joined Swedish King Karl XII against Peter the Great, is at
<br>the center of the current dispute. The GOR termed the GOU's
<br>plan to build a monument to Mazepa "anti-Russian," while
<br>xxxxx scoffed at the Ukraine's planned commemoration of the
<br>300th anniversary of the Battle of Poltava as "absurd." Some
<br>experts thought that the need to create a Ukrainian national
<br>identity was understandable, but choosing controversial
<br>figures as heroes would not resonate well with the Russians.
<br>
<br>More to Come: Black Sea Fleet and the Crimea
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) The Ukrainian Embassy expressed frustration with the
<br>sluggish pace of Black Sea Fleet negotiations. With its
<br>current agreement set to expire in 2017, the transfer of the
<br>fleet to another location should be a major issue on the
<br>bilateral agenda. The GOR, however, has consistently
<br>insisted that it is "premature" to discuss details.
<br>xxxxx said that the bilateral Black Sea Fleet
<br>sub-commission, with its 6th session completed on January 24,
<br>produced negligible results. In the meantime, the GOR has
<br>intensified activities in Sevastopol through pro-Russian and
<br>Russian-funded NGOs.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) With the political process still in flux in Ukraine,
<br>and the presidential transition in Russia underway, the
<br>bilateral relationship is on hold, with pivotal issues
<br>deferred until after May.
