<br>Office, Department of State. 
<br>REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On September 11 Supreme Leader Khamenei gave the 
<br>main Tehran Friday Prayer sermon.  In his comments Khamenei 
<br>sought to characterize his treatment of opposition in line with 
<br>the practices of both the first Shia Imam Ali and also with that 
<br>of his predecessor Ayatollah Khomeini.   He said while criticism 
<br>within the framework of the existing political system was 
<br>acceptable, those fundamentally opposing the system and seeking 
<br>to harm the nation's security will be dealt with decisively.  In 
<br>keeping with previous warnings about the "soft overthrow" of the 
<br>existing order, he cautioned against dissolution from within, 
<br>saying that the only way to prevent this was to remain true to 
<br>religion, revolutionary principles, and to Khomeini's teachings. 
<br>  The recent Presidential election with its massive turnout 
<br>proved to the world that "regardless of whom the people voted 
<br>for" they still believed in the system.  Referring to Iran's 
<br>position on the international stage, Khamenei said Iran took 
<br>pride in standing against the oppressive nature of its enemies 
<br>and that Iran wouldn't be cowed into relinquishing its rights, 
<br>"nuclear or non-nuclear."  He called for a large turnout on the 
<br>September 18 Qods Day march in support of the Palestinian 
<br>people, although warning that this event should not be used to 
<br>"sow dissension," an implied reference to the fact that "Green 
<br>Path" oppositionists are reportedly seeking a massive turn-out 
<br>on this day as a show of strength. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) SUMMMARY (CONT): Although Supreme Leader Khamenei 's tone 
<br>was consistently mild, Iranian press and IRPO contacts have 
<br>interpreted this speech as a clear warning to the "Green Path" 
<br>oppositionist leaders to cease and desist, an interpretation 
<br>reinforced by the contemporaneous release of a Judiciary panel 
<br>report stating that Mehdi Karrubi's allegations of prisoner 
<br>abuse were both baseless and also politically motivated, and the 
<br>forwarding of this case to judicial authorities for possible 
<br>prosecution (reftel). END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (U) On September 11, Supreme Leader Khamenei gave both Tehran 
<br>Friday Prayer Sermons (normally there are two, the first 
<br>covering ostensibly religious topics, the second focusing more 
<br>on issues of the day).  As the date fell on the anniversary of 
<br>the martyrdom of Imam Ali, the first Shia Imam, the topic of his 
<br>first sermon was the government of Imam Ali.  Although 
<br>putatively non-political in nature, Khamenei used this sermon to 
<br>set the stage for themes to which he would refer back in his 
<br>second, political, sermon.  He pointed out the moral nature of 
<br>Imam Ali's government, adding that "when religion is separated 
<br>from politics, politics becomes immoral and secular."  In an 
<br>implicit comparison with current times, he also stressed that 
<br>Imam Ali consistently preferred to be lenient in dealing with 
<br>those who opposed him, until and unless there was a threat to 
<br>the system, at which point he would act decisively. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>TYPES OF CONFLICT 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (U) In the start of his second, political speech, Supreme 
<br>Leader Khamenei said he wished to address his remarks to those 
<br>in Iran's political sphere.  Dissension had been a feature of 
<br>the Islamic Republic since its founding.  These conflicts have 
<br>had different causes, to include theoretical differences of 
<br>opinion, conflicts of interest and clashing personalities. 
<br>Referring implicitly to his comments on the management style of 
<br>Imam Ali, Khamenei said that Khomeini's normal method for 
<br>dealing with dissension and conflict was to use moderation and 
<br>leniency.  In an implicit reference to Mir Hossein Mousavi and 
<br>Mehdi Karrubi, each of whom has referred back to his own 
<br>revolutionary credentials, Khamenei said that at times Khomeini 
<br>had to deal with conflicts even with those who had solid 
<br>revolutionary backgrounds, at the level of the Prime Minister 
<br>(i.e. Mousavi himself), President (Khamenei himself) and even at 
<br>levels above the President (a reference to Khomeini's dismissal 
<br>of Supreme Leader-designate Ayatollah Montazeri). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (U) Khamenei said the system didn't seek to stifle those who 
<br>"think differently" (note: 'digar andishan," a term used to 
<br>refer to the intellectual current associated, inter alia, with 
<br>the Khatami-ist 'Second of Khordad' movement).  It was good for 
<br>Iran's officials to have critics point out weaknesses if those 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000379  002.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>doing so act within and accept the basic principles of the 
<br>system, and the government will not move against such criticism. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (U) However, again drawing the link to Imam Ali, Khamenei 
<br>said that during Khomeini's time if there were danger of 
<br>infiltration of "harmful principles" into the system, and if 
<br>this conflict were in some way a threat to core principles, 
<br>Khomeini would then "act decisively." The regime, much like any 
<br>human being, had to defend itself against such an attack. 
<br>Linking his actions to those of Imam Ali and Khomeini, Khamenei 
<br>said that today also the regime will act if it senses that 
<br>someone is acting against its principles and security. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>AVOIDING CORRUPTION FROM WITHIN 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (U) In keeping with recent dominant public warnings about 
<br>"soft overthrow" and "soft wars," Khamenei turned to the theme 
<br>of corruption from within, both at an individual and societal 
<br>level.  At an individual level, deviation from principles and 
<br>susceptibility to corruption were to be avoided at all costs, as 
<br>small slips and mistakes could lead to larger ones in a slow and 
<br>gradual process.  The cure for such threats is self-awareness, 
<br>piety and the ongoing moral policing of friends and family.  If 
<br>such impiety is happening to a government official the problem 
<br>is worse, as it affects society. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (U) At a societal and governmental level, deviation from 
<br>principles and susceptibility to corruption can happen in much 
<br>the same manner.  The decay comes from within, and although on 
<br>the outside the society can still appear like an  "Islamic 
<br>Republic," on the inside it could suffer degradation and decay. 
<br> In this regard, societal dynamics can either be positive or 
<br>negative.  Positive dynamics means moving ever closer towards 
<br>justice and religion, which improves social, political and 
<br>economic conditions and also improves society's abilities to 
<br>stand up to one's enemies.  But a society with negative dynamics 
<br>will have growing class and social differences and worsening 
<br>political and economic conditions.  Instead of using freedom for 
<br>growth, such a decaying society will abuse freedom to pursue 
<br>corruption, sin and dissension.  Such negative dynamics also 
<br>cause the society to "feel weak and retreat" in the face of 
<br>one's enemy, unilateral disarmament and relinquishing one's 
<br>rights, nuclear and non-nuclear, which is another sign of 
<br>societal decline. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>ELECTION 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (U) Supreme Leader Khamenei said the June 12 Presidential 
<br>election with its massive turnout was a glorious triumph for the 
<br>Islamic Revolution.  The turnout demonstrated to the world that 
<br>the Iranian people believed in their system of government now 
<br>more than ever, "regardless of who voted for whom.  After the 
<br>election, the enemy sought to create disturbances in order to 
<br>diminish Iran's achievement and weaken the peoples' confidence 
<br>in the system, but to no effect.  There will be similarly large 
<br>turnout in future elections, Khamenei predicted, showing the 
<br>ongoing support of the people. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>IRAN'S ENEMIES 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (U) Supreme Leader Khamenei said all governments have 
<br>enemies, but what is important to note is the nature of one's 
<br>friends and enemies.  Iran's friends are Muslim nations and 
<br>peoples throughout the world, and the oppressed of the world. 
<br>Its enemies are the thieves and oppressors of the world, and 
<br>Iran should not be scared to be the enemies of the U.S. and the 
<br>U.K.  It was important for Iran to show strength in the face of 
<br>such enemies. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>

<br>DUBAI 00000379  003.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>QODS DAY 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (U) Supreme Leader Khamenei said that many on the global 
<br>stage have tried to bury the issue of Palestine, but Iran has 
<br>prevented that, a fact which has upset "the U.S. and the 
<br>Zionists."  He called for a massive turnout of support on the 
<br>September 18 Qods Day Rally in Tehran, and cautioned all that no 
<br>one should use this event to sow dissension, an implicit 
<br>reference to "Green Path" opposition plans to use this 
<br>authorized march as a show of its own strength. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) COMMENT: Although his tone was mild, Iran oppositionist 
<br>press in addition to IRPO interlocutors with ties to the "Green 
<br>Path" opposition have said that, in the words of one source, 
<br>"Khameni's speech was being viewed ominously in Iran," 
<br>especially when viewed in conjunction with the contemporaneous 
<br>release of a Judiciary panel report stating that Mehdi Karrubi's 
<br>allegations of prisoner abuse were both baseless and also 
<br>politically motivated, and forwarding the case to judicial 
<br>authorities for possible prosecution (reftel).  According to one 
<br>executive branch official, Khamenei's speech has made "the 
<br>specter of the arrest of Karrubi - and possibly even Mousavi at 
<br>a later stage" all the more probable. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) COMMENT (CONT): Contrary to Khamenei's assertions and as 
<br>evidenced by recent comments by IRGC Commander Jaafari, the 
<br>regime's interpretation of legitimate dissent has constricted 
<br>dramatically, with Jaffari equating "soft overthrow" with those 
<br>seeking to change Iran's behavior in any way.   Certainly, 
<br>Khamenei seems to be trying to regain the high ground he 
<br>forfeited by descending so openly into the political fray, as 
<br>shown by his attempts to draw comparisons among himself, 
<br>Khomeini, and Imam Ali.  Separately, the Supreme Leader's 
<br>formulation of "relinquishing ones rights, nuclear or 
<br>non-nuclear" as a sign of societal dissolution and immorality 
<br>indicates that Iran will continue to adhere to its hard public 
<br>line in advance of any future negotiations.  Finally, it is also 
<br>worth noting that Supreme Leader Khamenei made no endorsement, 
<br>either explicit or implicit, of President Ahmadinejad, saying 
<br>only that the recent Presidential election was good due to the 
<br>turnout, "regardless of who voted for whom."   END COMMENT.
