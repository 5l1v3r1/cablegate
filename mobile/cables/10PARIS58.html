<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Charles H. Rivkin, Reasons 1.4(b),(d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: In keeping with France's unique history 
<br>and circumstances, Embassy Paris has created a Minority 
<br>Engagement Strategy that encompasses, among other groups, the 
<br>French Muslim population and responds to the goals outlined 
<br>in reftel A. Our aim is to engage the French population at 
<br>all levels in order to amplify France's efforts to realize 
<br>its own egalitarian ideals, thereby advancing U.S. national 
<br>interests. While France is justifiably proud of its leading 
<br>role in conceiving democratic ideals and championing human 
<br>rights and the rule of law, French institutions have not 
<br>proven themselves flexible enough to adjust to an 
<br>increasingly heterodox demography. We believe that if 
<br>France, over the long run, does not successfully increase 
<br>opportunity and provide genuine political representation for 
<br>its minority populations, France could become a weaker, more 
<br>divided country, perhaps more crisis-prone and 
<br>inward-looking, and consequently a less capable ally. To 
<br>support French efforts to provide equal opportunity for 
<br>minority populations, we will engage in positive discourse; 
<br>set a strong example; implement an aggressive youth outreach 
<br>strategy; encourage moderate voices; propagate best 
<br>practices; and deepen our understanding of the underlying 
<br>causes of inequality in France. We will also integrate the 
<br>efforts of various Embassy sections, target influential 
<br>leaders among our primary audiences, and evaluate both 
<br>tangible and intangible indicators of the success of our 
<br>strategy. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>BACKGROUND: THE CRISIS OF REPRESENTATION IN FRANCE 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C/NF) France has long championed human rights and the 
<br>rule of law, both at home and abroad, and justifiably 
<br>perceives itself as a historic leader among democratic 
<br>nations. This history and self-perception will serve us well 
<br>as we implement the strategy outlined here, in which we press 
<br>France toward a fuller application of the democratic values 
<br>it espouses. This strategy is necessary because French 
<br>institutions have not proven themselves flexible enough to 
<br>adjust to the country's increasingly heterodox demography. 
<br>Very few minorities hold leadership positions in France's 
<br>public institutions. As President Sarkozy's own Diversity 
<br>Czar Yazid Sabeg told Ambassador Rivkin in December, the 
<br>National Assembly "serves as a mirror of the crisis of 
<br>representation in France" (reftel B). The National Assembly, 
<br>among its 577 deputies, has a single black member from 
<br>metropolitan France (excluding its island territories), but 
<br>does not have any elected representatives of Muslim or Arab 
<br>extraction, though this minority group alone represents 
<br>approximately 10 percent of the population. The Senate has 
<br>two Muslim Senators (out of 343), but no black 
<br>representatives and only a few Senators hail from other 
<br>ethnic or religious minorities. Sabeg also noted that none 
<br>of France's approximately 180 Ambassadors is black, and only 
<br>one is of North African descent. Despite Sarkozy's 
<br>appointment of leaders such as Rachida Dati, Fidela Amara and 
<br>Rama Yade, minorities continue to confront a very thick glass 
<br>ceiling in France's public institutions. The French media 
<br>remains overwhelmingly white, with only modest increases in 
<br>minority representation on camera for major news broadcasts. 
<br>Among French elite educational institutions, we are only 
<br>aware that Sciences Po has taken serious steps to integrate. 
<br>While slightly better represented in private organizations, 
<br>minorities in France lead very few corporations and 
<br>foundations. Thus the reality of French public life defies 
<br>the nation's egalitarian ideals. In-group, elitist politics 
<br>still characterize French public institutions, while extreme 
<br>right, xenophobic policies hold appeal for a small (but 
<br>occasionally influential) minority. Post will continue to 
<br>explore other underlying causes of the social, political and 
<br>economic barriers impeding the advancement of minorities in 
<br>France (see Tactic 6, below). 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C/NF) France suffers consequences when its leading 
<br>institutions fail to reflect the composition of its 
<br>population. We believe France has not benefited fully from 
<br>the energy, drive, and ideas of its minorities. Despite some 
<br>French claims to serve as a model of assimilation and 
<br>meritocracy, undeniable inequities tarnish France's global 
<br>image and diminish its influence abroad. In our view, a 
<br>sustained failure to increase opportunity and provide genuine 
<br>political representation for its minority populations could 
<br>render France a weaker, more divided country. The 
<br>geopolitical consequences of France's weakness and division 
<br>will adversely affect U.S. interests, as we need strong 
<br>partners in the heart of Europe to help us promote democratic 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000058 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>values. Moreover, social exclusion has domestic consequences 
<br>for France, including the alienation of some segments of the 
<br>population, which can in turn adversely affect our own 
<br>efforts to fight global networks of violent extremists. A 
<br>thriving, inclusive French polity will help advance our 
<br>interests in expanding democracy and increasing stability 
<br>worldwide. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>A STRATEGY FOR FRANCE: OUR AIMS 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C/NF) The overarching goal of our minority outreach 
<br>strategy is to engage the French population at all levels in 
<br>order to help France to realize its own egalitarian ideals. 
<br>Our strategy has three broad target audiences in mind: (1) 
<br>the majority, especially the elites; (2) minorities, with a 
<br>focus on their leaders; (3) and the general population. 
<br>Employing the seven tactics described below, we aim (1) to 
<br>increase awareness among France's elites of the benefits of 
<br>expanding opportunity and the costs of maintaining the status 
<br>quo; (2) to improve the skills and grow the confidence of 
<br>minority leaders who seek to increase their influence; (3) 
<br>and to communicate to the general population in France that 
<br>we particularly admire the diversity and dynamism of its 
<br>population, while emphasizing the advantages of profiting 
<br>from those qualities by expanding opportunities for all. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>TACTIC 1: ENGAGE IN POSITIVE DISCOURSE 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NF) First, we will focus our discourse on the issue of 
<br>equal opportunity. When we give public addresses about the 
<br>community of democracies, we will emphasize, among the 
<br>qualities of democracy, the right to be different, protection 
<br>of minority rights, the value of equal opportunity, and the 
<br>importance of genuine political representation. In private 
<br>meetings, we will deliberately direct questions about equal 
<br>opportunity in France to high-level, non-minority French 
<br>leaders. Rather than retreating from discussions involving 
<br>two sacred cows in France -- the concepts of "secularism" and 
<br>"communitarianism" -- we will engage French leaders directly 
<br>about the role that their terminology and intellectual 
<br>frameworks could play in creating (or diminishing) equality 
<br>of opportunity in France. We will endeavor to convey the 
<br>costs to France of the under-representation of minorities, 
<br>highlighting the benefits we have accumulated, over time, by 
<br>working hard to chip away at the various impediments faced by 
<br>American minorities. We will, of course, continue to adopt a 
<br>humble attitude regarding our own situation in the U.S., but 
<br>nevertheless will stress the innumerable benefits accruing 
<br>from a proactive approach to broad social inclusion, 
<br>complementing our French partners on any positive steps they 
<br>take. In addition, we will continue and intensify our work 
<br>with French museums and educators to reform the history 
<br>curriculum taught in French schools, so that it takes into 
<br>account the role and perspectives of minorities in French 
<br>history. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>TACTIC 2: SET A STRONG EXAMPLE 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C/NF) Second, we will employ the tool of example. We 
<br>will continue and expand our efforts to bring minority 
<br>leaders from the U.S. to France, working with these American 
<br>leaders to convey an honest sense of their experience to 
<br>French minority and non-minority leaders alike. When we send 
<br>French leaders to America, we will include, as often as 
<br>possible, a component of their trip that focuses on equal 
<br>opportunity. In the Embassy, we will continue to invite a 
<br>broad spectrum of French society to our events, and avoid, as 
<br>appropriate, hosting white-only events, or minority-only 
<br>events. We will be inclusive, working in this way to break 
<br>down barriers, facilitate communication, and expand networks. 
<br>By bringing together groups who would not otherwise interact 
<br>together, the Embassy will continue to use its cachet to 
<br>create networking opportunities that cut through traditional 
<br>cultural and social barriers in France. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>TACTIC 3: LAUNCH AGGRESSIVE YOUTH OUTREACH 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C/NF) Third, we will continue and expand our youth 
<br>outreach efforts in order to communicate about our shared 
<br>values with young French audiences of all socio-cultural 
<br>backgrounds. Leading the charge on this effort, the 
<br>Ambassador's inter-agency Youth Outreach Initiative aims to 
<br>engender a positive dynamic among French youth that leads to 
<br>greater support for U.S. objectives and values. Some 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000058 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>elements of our Youth Outreach Initiative have particular 
<br>importance for minorities, including: 
<br>
<br>-- Drawing heavily on new media, we aim first to build trust 
<br>and gain understanding among French youth from diverse 
<br>backgrounds. 
<br>
<br>-- While reinforcing mutual trust and understanding, we seek 
<br>to help France's next generation improve their capacity to 
<br>lead in their communities, while also conveying the 
<br>importance of transcending the bounds of their own 
<br>communities in order to make a broader, national impact. 
<br>
<br>-- To achieve these aims, we will build on the expansive 
<br>Public Diplomacy programs already in place at post, and 
<br>develop creative, additional means to influence the youth of 
<br>France, employing new media, corporate partnerships, 
<br>nationwide competitions, targeted outreach events, especially 
<br>invited U.S. guests. 
<br>
<br>-- We will also develop new tools to identify, learn from, 
<br>and influence future French leaders. 
<br>
<br>-- As we expand training and exchange opportunities for the 
<br>youth of France, we will continue to make absolutely certain 
<br>that the exchanges we support are inclusive. 
<br>
<br>-- We will build on existing youth networks in France, and 
<br>create new ones in cyberspace, connecting France's future 
<br>leaders to each other in a forum whose values we help to 
<br>shape -- values of inclusion, mutual respect, and open 
<br>dialogue. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>TACTC 4: ENCOURAGE MODERATE VOICES 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C/NF) Fourth, we will encourage moderate voices of 
<br>tolerance to express themselves with courage and conviction. 
<br>Building on our work with two prominent websites geared 
<br>toward young French-speaking Muslims -- oumma.fr and 
<br>saphirnews.com -- we will support, train, and engage media 
<br>and political activists who share our values. As we continue 
<br>to meet with moderate leaders of minority groups, we will 
<br>also expand our efforts to facilitate grass roots inter-faith 
<br>exchanges. We will share in France, with faith communities 
<br>and with the Ministry of the Interior, the most effective 
<br>techniques for teaching tolerance currently employed in 
<br>American mosques, synagogues, churches, and other religious 
<br>institutions. We will engage directly with the Ministry of 
<br>Interior to compare U.S. and French approaches to supporting 
<br>minority leaders who seek moderation and mutual 
<br>understanding, while also comparing our responses to those 
<br>who seek to sow hatred and discord. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>TACTC 5: PROPAGATE BEST PRACTICES 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C/NF) Fifth, we will continue our project of sharing 
<br>best practices with young leaders in all fields, including 
<br>young political leaders of all moderate parties so that they 
<br>have the toolkits and mentoring to move ahead. We will 
<br>create or support training and exchange programs that teach 
<br>the enduring value of broad inclusion to schools, civil 
<br>society groups, bloggers, political advisors, and local 
<br>politicians. Through outreach programs, Embassy officers 
<br>from all sections will interact and communicate to these same 
<br>groups our best practices in creating equal opportunities for 
<br>all Americans. We will also provide tools for teaching 
<br>tolerance to the network of over 1,000 American university 
<br>students who teach English in French schools every year. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>TACTIC 6: DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C/NF) Sixth, through focused contact work, reporting 
<br>and analysis, we will deepen the USG understanding of the 
<br>underlying causes of inequality and discrimination in France. 
<br>We will break new ground by examining how the very structure 
<br>of some French institutions may limit minority representation 
<br>in elected office and the high ranks of the civil service. 
<br>Examining significant developments in depth, such as the 
<br>debate on national identity (reftel B), we plan to track 
<br>trends and, ideally, predict change in the status of 
<br>minorities in France, estimating how this change will impact 
<br>U.S. interests. As our awareness expands and deepens, we 
<br>will adjust, accordingly, the minority outreach strategy 
<br>described here. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000058 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>TACTIC 7: INTEGRATE, TARGET, AND EVALUATE OUR EFFORTS 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C/NF) Finally, a Minority Working Group will integrate 
<br>the discourse, actions, and analysis of relevant sections and 
<br>agencies in the Embassy. This group, working in tandem with 
<br>the Youth Outreach Initiative, will identify and target 
<br>influential leaders and groups among our primary audiences. 
<br>It will also evaluate our impact over the course of the year, 
<br>by examining both tangible and intangible indicators of 
<br>success. Tangible changes include a measurable increase in 
<br>the number of minorities leading and participating in public 
<br>and private organizations, including elite educational 
<br>institutions; growth in the number of constructive efforts by 
<br>minority leaders to organize political support both within 
<br>and beyond their own minority communities; new, proactive 
<br>policies to enhance social inclusion adopted by non-minority 
<br>political leaders; expansion of inter-communal and 
<br>inter-faith exchanges at the local level; decrease in popular 
<br>support for xenophobic political parties and platforms. 
<br>While we could never claim credit for these positive 
<br>developments, we will focus our efforts in carrying out 
<br>activities, described above, that prod, urge and stimulate 
<br>movement in the right direction. In addition, we will track 
<br>intangible measures of success -- a growing sense of 
<br>belonging, for example, among young French minorities, and a 
<br>burgeoning hope that they, too, can represent their country 
<br>at home, and abroad, even one day at the pinnacle of French 
<br>public life, as president of the Republic.
