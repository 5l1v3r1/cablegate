<br>SUBJECT: Egypt: Tax Reform Continues As Revenues Meet Lowered 
<br>Expectations 
<br> 
<br>REF: 10 CAIRO 26 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (SBU) KEY POINTS 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-- Egypt's Tax Commissioner expects the implementation of the new 
<br>real estate law to proceed without significant alternations. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-- He claims that much of the public resistance to filing property 
<br>declarations is rooted in people's desire to maintain the secrecy 
<br>of their wealth, which has traditionally been held in real estate. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-- Egypt's tax revenue is down substantially from last year, but 
<br>appears to be on track to meet budgetary expectations. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-- No new tax laws are expected to be presented to the Parliament 
<br>prior to the upcoming parliamentary and presidential election 
<br>cycles, but the Tax Authority will continue working to automate its 
<br>systems and improve data collection in support of expanding and 
<br>deepening the tax base. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>

<br> 
<br>Real Estate Tax Law Unchanged 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (SBU) In a February 7 meeting, Ashraf Al Arabi, Egypt's Deputy 
<br>Minister of Finance for Tax Policy and Commissioner of the Egyptian 
<br>Tax Authority, told us that he was confident that implementation of 
<br>the real estate tax would go ahead as scheduled (ref A). He 
<br>acknowledged the negative publicity surrounding the registration of 
<br>properties, which had "created anxiety" among taxpayers. Despite 
<br>this, he was confident that the plan would move forward  with "no 
<br>official changes." Referencing President Mubarak's comments last 
<br>month,  in which Mubarak suggested he might advocate for a 
<br>progressive tax structure or possible homestead exemption, Al Arabi 
<br>told us that the real estate tax situation had subsequently "been 
<br>clarified to the President" and that Mubarak supported leaving the 
<br>law intact. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (SBU) Al Arabi explained that there were a number of reasons for 
<br>the public outcry against the real estate tax: Since most income 
<br>tax is paid through direct payroll deductions, the vast majority of 
<br>taxpayers in Egypt have no experience dealing directly with the Tax 
<br>Authority (Note: for taxpayers who have income tax deducted by 
<br>their employer, there is no annual tax filing requirement. End 
<br>note). His office, Al Arabi said, deals directly with only about 
<br>3.1 million corporate and self-employed tax filers. The new real 
<br>estate tax registration requirement will now bring 40 million 
<br>Egyptians in contact with the Tax Authority. He added that part of 
<br>the outcry relates to people's resistance to disclosing their real 
<br>estate holdings.  According to Al Arabi, Egyptians have 
<br>traditionally used real estate as their primary store of wealth, 
<br>and people do not want information on their assets disclosed to the 
<br>government or made public. This echoes his public comments 
<br>suggesting that once holdings are declared, some people, 
<br>particularly government employees, might find it difficult to 
<br>explain where they got the resources to buy the properties they 
<br>own.

<br> 
<br>Revenues on Track, But  Reforms Have Slowed 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (SBU) In Egypt's fiscal 2009/10 budget, tax revenues are 
<br>projected at LE 145.5 billion (US$26.5 billion) down 10.8% from 
<br>last year. Actual tax revenues during the first six month of the 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>fiscal year (July-December) are down 8.5%. Tax revenues from the 
<br>Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), the state-owned oil 
<br>company, which were budgeted to drop 45% due to lower world oil 
<br>prices are actually running about 6% lower than the already reduced 
<br>budget forecast. With the exception of the EGPC revenue, Al Arabi 
<br>asserted that revenues will meet projections and that the shortfall 
<br>from EGPC taxes could be made up by better than expected revenues 
<br>from taxes on treasury bills and bonds, which are taxable for the 
<br>first time this year. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (SBU) Al Arabi said that the onset of the financial crisis in 
<br>2008 stalled well-advanced plans to replace the sales and 
<br>consumption taxes with a unified Value Added Tax (VAT), and that he 
<br>did not envision much progress in that area until after the 2010 
<br>Parliamentary elections and the 2011 Presidential election. He 
<br>explained that some articles of the new law might still be passed 
<br>even if the complete reform could not yet be addressed. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (SBU) Al Arabi told us that tax collection procedures had 
<br>improved substantially, particularly for corporate taxpayers, and 
<br>that the GOE had made progress in closing loopholes and incentives 
<br>for tax evasion. Tax preparers are now jointly liable with their 
<br>clients for information provided in tax returns. This has removed 
<br>much of the incentive for accountants to evade rather than comply 
<br>with the law. He said that the Tax Authority still has major 
<br>compliance issues with small and mid-sized businesses, many of whom 
<br>deal strictly in cash and lack many of the formal legal and 
<br>accounting structures that would aid in tax collection. He 
<br>estimated that the government's tax revenues currently amount to 
<br>13-14% of GDP, but that by taxing the large informal economy, this 
<br>could rise to 20%. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
<br> 
<br>Improvements in Data Collection Are the Key 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (SBU) El Arabi, who has been in his current position for a 
<br>little less than three years, comes from a private sector 
<br>accounting and auditing background. He stated that the 
<br>reorganization he has done in the Tax Authority has proven 
<br>difficult. He pointed to the example of consolidating the 64 "tax 
<br>regions" that had previously existed into the 15 regions that exist 
<br>today. This consolidation removed a great deal of redundant 
<br>bureaucracy, but also limited promotion possibilities for Tax 
<br>Authority employees. He said successes in automation and 
<br>segmentation meant that the Tax Authority was "no longer a soft 
<br>administration" within the government. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (SBU) Al Arabi credited US assistance through USAID with much of 
<br>the progress in both automation and training within the Tax 
<br>Authority. He added that further progress in tax collection will be 
<br>reliant on the quality of information gathered and the proper 
<br>analysis of that data. He said he plans to create an "internal 
<br>inspection unit" and will build an "intelligence center" for data 
<br>collection and verification. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>

<br> 
<br>Comment 
<br> 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (SBU) Lower revenues and higher budget deficits remain a worry 
<br>both for Egyptian policy makers and the rest of the financial 
<br>community. Egypt does, however, appear to be on track to meet its 
<br>tax revenue projections for the year. As reported septel, the 
<br>spending side of the equation is less promising, as greater than 
<br>expected expenditures on subsidy programs and fiscal stimulus 
<br>packages continue to put a strain on the overall budget.  Public 
<br>discontent with many of the measures proposed by Finance Minister 
<br>Youssef Boutros Ghali, including the real estate tax,  continues to 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>be reflected in the press and among some members of the Parliament. 
<br>However, all indications are that Boutros Ghali continues to have 
<br>the support of the President, and the much needed fiscal reforms he 
<br>has been promoting will continue, though perhaps at a slower pace.
