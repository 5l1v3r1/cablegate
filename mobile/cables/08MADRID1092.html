<br>Classified By: DCM Arnold A. Chacon, for reasons 1.4(b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Ambassador Aguirre ensured that Spain's
<br>outgoing Chief of Defense and the Chiefs of the Spanish Army,
<br>Navy and Air Force Staff were properly celebrated September
<br>¶25. Hosting a cocktail reception for more than 90 attendees,
<br>complete with a color guard and a 6-piece military jazz band,
<br>the Ambassador recognized the exemplary careers of the
<br>retiring military leadership and honored the new "cupola."
<br>During a round of courtesy calls begun September 15 with the
<br>new CHOD, Ambassador Aguirre was able to meet the new
<br>leadership one-on-one, reinforcing the excellent
<br>military-to-military relationship and engaging the new chiefs
<br>on key USG interests. The calls also served to introduce his
<br>new Deputy Chief of Mission and to explain the U.S. election
<br>timetable that could result in an extended period as Charge
<br>d'Affaires.
<br>
<br>//VALEDICTORY "RAZZMATAZZ"//
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The Ambassador hosted the reception in honor of
<br>General Felix Sanz Roldan, the recently departed CHOD who has
<br>assumed a new role as special envoy for EU defense matters,
<br>and the recently departed Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force
<br>and Army and the former CNO. The CHOD and all the service
<br>chiefs were relieved on July 21 (ref A). Naval Station Rota
<br>provided a Joint Color Guard and the Sixth Fleet Band
<br>provided a six-piece Jazz Ensemble. The event, unusual by
<br>Spanish military standards that do not allow for "change of
<br>command" ceremonies, per se, was a huge success with the
<br>honorees and their wives in attendance as well as the current
<br>CHOD, and the new Air Force Chief of Staff and Chief of Naval
<br>Operations. Ambassador Aguirre addressed each of the
<br>outgoing officers and presented flags that had flown over the
<br>U.S. Embassy to retiring CNO Admiral Zaragoza, former Air
<br>Force Chief of Staff General Garcia de la Vega, and outgoing
<br>Spanish Army Chief of Staff General Villar. To General Sanz,
<br>the Ambassador presented a framed edition of the "Don't Tread
<br>on Me" flag flown over U.S. Navy ships since September 11,
<br>and explained its historical symbolism dating back to the
<br>Revolutionary War. Sanz spoke extemporaneously following the
<br>Ambassador's remarks, recalling how his close association
<br>with U.S. forces from the earliest days of his military
<br>career had been instrumental to his professional success and
<br>his enduring goodwill toward the United States.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) In the lead-up to the unprecedented hail and farewell
<br>party, Ambassador Aguirre sought courtesy calls with the
<br>entire new cupola. He congratulated each officer on his new
<br>position, reviewed key programs in the jurisdiction of each
<br>of the services, and reviewed the robust exchange
<br>relationships between U.S. and Spanish military academies and
<br>staff colleges.
<br>
<br>//CHIEF OF DEFENSE GENERAL RODRIGUEZ//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Spanish Air Force Lieutenant General Jose Julio
<br>Rodriguez Fernandez was named Chief of Defense (JEMAD) of the
<br>Spanish Armed Forces on July 18 and replaced General Sanz on
<br>July 21 (ref A). General Rodriguez is a fighter-attack pilot
<br>by background. With 42 years of military service, he most
<br>recently served as the Director General for Armament and
<br>Materiel in the Ministry of Defense (the senior uniformed
<br>acquisition official). During the Ambassador's September 15
<br>courtesy call, Rodriguez was pleasant and low-key and
<br>conveyed obvious admiration and good feeling toward his
<br>predecessor. The Ambassador congratulated Rodriguez on his
<br>promotion and invited him to take part in the planned
<br>reception. Rodriguez, who was originally not scheduled to be
<br>in town September 25, told the Ambassador that "things could
<br>change" and, in fact, attended.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The CHOD briefed the Ambassador on the meeting of NATO
<br>CHODS he had attended in Bulgaria the weekend of September
<br>13, especially the considerable time spent discussing
<br>Georgia. Rodriguez also made reference to turning the page
<br>
<br>in Afghanistan, expressing the idea that the U.S. election
<br>presented opportunities for the Zapatero Administration to
<br>modify some of its foreign policy positions. The Ambassador
<br>and the CHOD agreed there was no baggage between the United
<br>States and Spain on Afghanistan. The Ambassador also
<br>referenced shared Spanish and U.S. interests in the context
<br>of the U.S. Africa Command. The Ambassador sought the CHOD's
<br>views on the likelihood Spain would sign a Letter of
<br>Agreement by October 31 to purchase Tomahawk missiles.
<br>Rodriguez indicated the action was with the MOD and noted the
<br>draft 2009 budget -- with not more than a 5 per cent increase
<br>expected over last year -- was not out yet. Rodriguez
<br>indicated that the Navy, in accordance with Spanish
<br>procedure, must present its case for this requirement to the
<br>Ministry of Defense. The Ambassador asked him to let us know
<br>if there was a problem. Turning to other potential
<br>acquisitions, the Ambassador told Rodriguez that the United
<br>States hoped that the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) could be the
<br>solution to Spain's long-term requirement for modern tactical
<br>aircraft replacements for its Air Force and Navy. Again
<br>citing Spain's process for filling these kinds of
<br>requirements, Rodriguez allowed that, for the fighter
<br>requirement, the process was just beginning. Finally, GEN
<br>Rodriguez agreed to host Admiral Fitzgerald for Spain's
<br>National Day observance the weekend of October 11, including
<br>securing an invitation to the King's reception.
<br>
<br>//CHIEF OF SPANISH NAVY STAFF ADMIRAL REBOLLO//
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In office calls on September 18, the Ambassador
<br>reinforced the same points with the new Chief of Naval
<br>Operations and the Army's Chief of Staff. Admiral Rebollo,
<br>who assumed his duties July 21, was warm and engaging. He
<br>had been former CNO Admiral Zaragoza's Vice Chief of Naval
<br>Operations and is expected to continue to support Zaragoza's
<br>naval initiatives. He has the distinction of having started
<br>his military career as an enlisted man. Rebollo also said
<br>the Tomahawk decision was now going to the MOD, and he was
<br>hopeful but not certain the MOD would approve the purchase.
<br>Concerning piracy, the Admiral observed Spain's deployment of
<br>a P-3 maritime patrol aircraft was more of a political show
<br>than a substantive military action. The Ambassador asked
<br>that Spain consider hosting the headquarters portion of
<br>forthcoming AFRICOM and SOCEUR Flintlock exercise (originally
<br>intended for Mauritania), and Admiral Rebollo agreed to
<br>consider it. (NOTE: On October 9 we received formal
<br>agreement from Spain to host this important exercise at Rota.
<br>End note.)
<br>
<br>//CHIEF OF SPANISH ARMY STAFF GENERAL COLL//
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Also on September 18, the Ambassador thanked General
<br>Fulgencio Coll for Spain's contributions to overseas
<br>deployments in Lebanon, Kosovo, Bosnia, and Afghanistan and
<br>sought Coll's views on the possibility of lifting the cap of
<br>3,000 on Spanish overseas deployments. General Coll was very
<br>warm and engaging and seemed pleased the Ambassador was
<br>making the call. Prior to his July 18 appointment (ref A),
<br>Coll had carried out two of this Socialist Government's most
<br>significant military decisions ) the withdrawal from Iraq in
<br>2004 and the establishment of the Emergency Military Unit
<br>(UME, or Unidad Militar de Emergencia) in 2006. GEN Coll was
<br>born in Palma de Mallorca and comes from a distinguished
<br>Balearic military and political family. His father,
<br>Fulgencio Coll de San Simon, was also a general in the
<br>Spanish Army and former President of Provincial Deputation,
<br>as well as Civil Governor of Bilbao in the 1970s. GEN Coll
<br>entered the Spanish military academy in 1966 and graduated as
<br>an infantry branch lieutenant in 1970. Unlike other Spanish
<br>general officers, he has spent long periods of time in troop
<br>units and especially in command positions as a senior
<br>officer.
<br>
<br>//CHIEF OF SPANISH AIR FORCE STAFF GENERAL JIMENEZ//
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The new head of the Spanish Air Force, General Jose
<br>Jimenez Ruiz, also warmly received Ambassador Aguirre on
<br>September 25, just hours before the reception in his honor.
<br>During the 30-minute call, followed by a tour of Air Force
<br>headquarters, General Jimenez spoke openly about his family.
<br>The Ambassador reiterated to Jimenez his thanks for Spain's
<br>contributions to overseas deployments. Until May 2008,
<br>
<br>
<br>Jimenez had served as the commander of the Spanish Air Forces
<br>in the Canary Islands (ref A). He was a surprise pick for
<br>the top Air Force job, advancing from being a soon-to-retire
<br>2-star general to a four-star Chief virtually overnight.
<br>According to DAO sources, he was considering retirement from
<br>the Canaries in May, when he was told by someone in the
<br>Ministry of Defense not to submit his paperwork. Within the
<br>month, he had received a promotion to Lieutenant General, a
<br>fact unknown to then-Air Force Chief of Staff, General Garcia
<br>de la Vega. When the Minister of Defense replaced the Chief
<br>of Defense and all three service chiefs in July, General
<br>Jimenez was given a fourth star and named Air Force Chief of
<br>Staff.
<br>
<br>//Comment//
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) We enjoyed a very close relationship with the previous
<br>CHOD and service chiefs. The initial encounters with their
<br>replacements suggest that excellent working relationship is
<br>going to continue. The Spanish military is highly
<br>disciplined to its civilian leadership, but it is worth
<br>remembering that whatever our differences with Spanish
<br>politicians, the armed forces are always well-disposed to
<br>work with the U.S., both bilaterally and the context of NATO.
<br>The agreement to host the Flintlock exercise, obtained on
<br>very short notice when events in Mauritania made that venue
<br>inadvisable, is important in and of itself, but it is also a
<br>symbol of how healthy the military-to-military relationship
<br>is.
