<br>SUBJECT: COALITION TESTED AS US-EU TFTP/SWIFT AGREEMENT 
<br>PASSES ON GERMAN ABSTENTION 
<br> 
<br>REF: A. BERLIN 1393 
<br>     ¶B. BERLIN 1377 
<br>     ¶C. BERLIN 1167 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: DCM Greg T. Delawie for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: German Federal Interior Minister Thomas de 
<br>Maiziere overruled Justice Minister Sabine 
<br>Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger and abstained from voting at the 
<br>November 30 COREPER vote in Brussels on an interim U.S.-EU 
<br>agreement to continue the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. 
<br> De Maiziere's decision allowed the agreement to pass and 
<br>followed weeks of engagement in Berlin, Brussels and 
<br>Washington as well as high-level interventions from Secretary 
<br>Clinton, Treasury Secretary Geithner, Attorney General 
<br>Holder, National Security Advisor Gen. Jones and Ambassador 
<br>Murphy.  De Maiziere's decision was difficult for him to make 
<br>given that the coalition agreement called for specific 
<br>revisions to the SWIFT agreement, none of which Germany 
<br>achieved, except a shortening of the interim period from 12 
<br>to 9 months.  The episode has tested Germany's new coalition 
<br>government just weeks after its formation with 
<br>Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger heavily criticizing the 
<br>abstention.  This experience suggests that we will need to 
<br>pay close attention to Germany during our negotiations on a 
<br>long-term TFTP agreement.  END SUMMARY 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Germany Relents Following Intense Pressure 
<br>--------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C)  Ambassador Murphy met with Interior Minister de 
<br>Maiziere on November 27 and urged him to support U.S.-EU 
<br>negotiations on an interim TFTP agreement, to which de 
<br>Maiziere indicated that he would abstain from voting on the 
<br>agenda item at the November 30 COREPER meeting.  De 
<br>Maiziere's decision, which followed a German request to 
<br>shorten the duration of the interim agreement to nine months 
<br>rather than twelve, facilitated the passing of the agreement 
<br>as Germany was the strongest holdout.  De Maiziere's decision 
<br>followed two weeks of intense lobbying in Berlin, Brussels 
<br>and Washington by Embassy Berlin, USEU, the Departments of 
<br>Treasury, State and Justice and the NSC.  The campaign 
<br>included calls by Secretaries Clinton, Geithner, the Attorney 
<br>General and the National Security Advisor to their German 
<br>counterparts.  State Department Counterterrorism Coordinator 
<br>Benjamin urged support for the agreement during a two-day 
<br>visit to Berlin (see septel).  Ambassador Murphy twice wrote 
<br>to all five relevant ministers (Interior, Justice, Finance, 
<br>Chancellery, and MFA) and made repeated calls to senior 
<br>decision makers, stressing the importance of the interim 
<br>agreement and the need for Germany to not block it.  The DCM, 
<br>Econ M/C, and staff from multiple embassy sections heavily 
<br>engaged on the issue as well. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C)  De Maiziere (CDU) stressed that his decision was not 
<br>an easy one given that the Christian Democrat/Social Union 
<br>(CDU/CSU) and Free Democratic Party (FDP) coalition had 
<br>differing views on the TFTP program.  The outcome 
<br>particularly irritated Justice Minister 
<br>Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger because she had expressed 
<br>concerns about the TFTP dating back to the initial July 
<br>decision to give the negotiating mandate to the Swedish EU 
<br>Presidency.  Furthermore, in October 
<br>Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger had inserted language into the 
<br>CDU/CSU-FDP coalition agreement specifically addressing the 
<br>TFTP negotiations and directing Germany to call upon the EU 
<br>to work towards a higher level of data protection (see Ref 
<br>B).  Following de Maiziere's decision, the Justice Minister 
<br>complained that her views were ignored and that the decision 
<br>has "upset millions of citizens of Europe."  De Maiziere told 
<br>the Ambassador that he would be expressing some criticisms of 
<br>the agreement publicly in order to reflect MoI concerns and 
<br>to deflect public criticism.  He was subsequently quoted as 
<br>saying that "a not completely satisfactory agreement is 
<br>better than none at all."

<br> 
<br>German Vote Comes with Costs for the Coalition 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) De Maiziere intimated, and working level contacts have 
<br>confirmed, that Germany would like to avoid a repeat of our 
<br>all-out lobbying effort during the negotiations for a 
<br>long-term TFTP agreement.  De Maiziere's strong preference is 
<br>to seek consensus with his ministry colleagues.  He 
<br>particularly wants to avoid another clash with the Justice 
<br>Minister on this issue as it has caused no small amount of 
<br>discord between the new coalition partners, who are having a 
<br>rocky start on a number of fronts.  The incident is 
<br>particularly difficult for de Maiziere as he entered the 
<br>Interior Ministry stressing that he represented a break from 
<br>his predecessor Wolfgang Schaeuble, whom he felt overly 
<br>focused on security issues (see Ref A).  De Maiziere surely 
<br>finds this whole experience regrettable as it put him in 
<br>exactly the position he did not want to be in: seemingly 
<br>siding with the U.S. over German interests, causing 
<br>disruption within the coalition, and compromising the data 
<br>privacy rights of German citizens. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Engaging the FDP on Data Privacy 
<br>--------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) It is not altogether surprising that this disagreement 
<br>arose given the FDP's reputation as a staunch defender of 
<br>citizens' privacy rights (see Ref C).  Nevertheless, the 
<br>intensity of this dispute should be a wake up call - we must 
<br>avoid repeating this as we look to completing the long-term 
<br>U.S.-EU TFTP agreement.  The coalition agreement calls for 
<br>strict limitations on the use of TFTP data, no automatic 
<br>access to the system, data deletion requirements, clear rules 
<br>on sharing information with third parties and legal redress. 
<br>These positions will guide Germany's views in the follow-on 
<br>negotiations, and we need to consider how to take them into 
<br>account in a way that does not complicate TFTP 
<br>implementation. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Embassy Berlin is examining how we can reach out to 
<br>FDP ministers and parliamentarians to educate them on U.S. 
<br>data protection structures as this experience has 
<br>demonstrated that they are often misinformed on the nature of 
<br>our policies.  We will likewise reach out to CDU/CSU decision 
<br>makers, in part to enlist their help in reaching the German 
<br>public.  We also intend to make the point that countering 
<br>terrorism in a globalized world, where terrorists and their 
<br>supporters use open borders and information technology to 
<br>quickly move people and financing, requires robust 
<br>international data sharing.
