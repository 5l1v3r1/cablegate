<br>
<br>Classified By: DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION ALEX WOLFF, FOR REASONS 1.4 B/D 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: U.S.-French cooperation on terrorism is 
<br>mature and broad-based. For a number of reasons, including 
<br>the memory of terrorist attacks in Paris during the 1980s, 
<br>the French bring significant expertise, focus and 
<br>determination to their C/T activities, and are valued 
<br>partners for a wide range of USG agencies. C/T cooperation 
<br>with the USG is largely insulated from the day-to-day 
<br>political and diplomatic tussles that can make the French 
<br>often difficult allies. Notwithstanding this solid 
<br>foundation, Post has outlined three areas where we believe 
<br>our C/T objectives can be better served, and proposes 
<br>suggestions to implement these objectives. End summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>A MATURE, SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Embassy Paris comprises one of the widest range of 
<br>USG agency representation anywhere in the world. Many of 
<br>these agencies play a role in the remarkably broad 
<br>U.S.-France security and counter-terrorism relationship. In 
<br>addition to State's Consular, Diplomatic Security, Economic, 
<br>Political, and Public Diplomacy sections that each handle 
<br>pieces of the terrorism portfolio, other non-State sections 
<br>in Paris that deal with the French on terrorism issues 
<br>include the DEA, the Defense Attache, a DOJ liaison 
<br>prosecutor, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) located 
<br>in Paris and in the port cities of Le Havre and Marseilles, 
<br>Legatt/FBI, NCIS, OSI, ROAL, a Transportation Security 
<br>Administration (TSA) representative, and the Secret Service. 
<br>A significant portion of the work of the Embassy's EST office 
<br>is now counterterrorism-related. Other non-traditional 
<br>security-oriented offices also contribute to counterterrorism 
<br>work. For example, the Foreign Agricultural Service Office 
<br>liaises with French agriculture authorities on biosafety 
<br>risks. In addition, USG personnel are assigned to Interpol 
<br>headquarters in Lyon, France's second largest city. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Two reasons for this breadth of USG representation are 
<br>1) France's own outsized role internationally and within the 
<br>EU on counter-terrorism issues; and 2) a long-term 
<br>institutional desire by the GOF to maintain close relations 
<br>with USG C/T professionals. In addition to this permanent 
<br>USG presence, delegations from the United States often visit 
<br>France to discuss specialized aspects of C/T. Two noteworthy 
<br>recent examples were a DOE/NRC/NSC/STATE visit in January on 
<br>the protection of nuclear facilities and radiological 
<br>materials. The visit has led to the development of the a 
<br>multi-year program to share best practices, swap observers at 
<br>nuclear security exercises, and collaborate scientifically to 
<br>improve passive security measures for nuclear facilities. 
<br>Also, in December 2004, then-Secretary of Health and Human 
<br>Services Tommy Thompson led an HHS/STATE delegation to a G-8 
<br>meeting hosted in France to engage at a deeper level on the 
<br>threat of bioterrorism. The ongoing work of the Bioterrorism 
<br>Experts Group includes such items as best practices in 
<br>protection of the food supply; information sharing on 
<br>zoonotic diseases; licensing issues on medical 
<br>countermeasures; sharing of information regarding vaccine 
<br>availability; and the sharing of national response plans. 
<br>France hosted two bioterrorism conferences in April in Lyon: 
<br>the first Interpol conference devoted to this subject and a 
<br>WHO-sponsored meeting on Biosafety and Biorisks. France 
<br>participates actively in these fora and sends experts to 
<br>U.S.-hosted biosafety/biorisk seminars in the U.S. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Internationally, France is a long-standing contributor 
<br>of military troops and assistance in Afghanistan and a French 
<br>admiral is regularly in the rotation to command Task Force 
<br>150, a multinational naval force that patrols the Red Sea and 
<br>the Persian Gulf to interdict the movement of suspected 
<br>terrorists from Afghanistan to the Arabian Peninsula. French 
<br>Special Forces also operate closely with coalition forces in 
<br>Afghanistan. It is a key member of the UN's 
<br>Counter-Terrorism Committee and the G-8's Counter-Terrorism 
<br>Action Group, and it has supported (and co-sponsored, where 
<br>possible) terrorist designations to the UN's 1267 sanctions 
<br>committee. Bilaterally, France recently signed two updated 
<br>agreements on extradition and counter-terrorism cooperation, 
<br>and cooperates closely on Container Security Initiative (CSI) 
<br>and airline security issues. Domestically, France continues 
<br>to hold in pretrial detention 6 of the 7 ex-GTMO French 
<br>citizen detainees (the seventh was declared not an enemy 
<br>combatant by the Department of Defense). All six will be 
<br>charged with "terrorist conspiracy," which has a maximum 
<br>sentence of ten years. Most recently, terrorism 
<br>investigating judges and prosecutors successfully argued for 
<br>the conviction of Djamel Beghal and five accomplices arrested 
<br>in 2001 on suspicion of planning to bomb the U.S. Embassy in 
<br>Paris. Beghal and his five accomplices were convicted on 
<br>March 15 and all received jail sentences. Other significant 
<br>C/T operations include the dismantling of a local cell of 
<br>"French jihadists to Iraq," a raid on and continuing 
<br>investigation of the MEK presence in France, the dismantling 
<br>of a GICM cell, and the near-destruction of ETA support cells 
<br>in the south of France. Additional examples are reviewed in 
<br>ref B. 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>AREAS TO IMPROVE 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) As noted in ref C, France often appears to react 
<br>differently to terrorism and radical Islam depending on its 
<br>distance from it. Within its borders, the GOF reacts 
<br>proactively, with speed and firmness. Elsewhere in the 
<br>world, it is much more equivocal. Political and diplomatic 
<br>considerations carry substantial weight, and sometimes trump 
<br>security considerations. A good example of this is continued 
<br>French intransigence within the EU on Hezbollah. It sees the 
<br>EU's listing of Hezbollah as a bad idea for Lebanon's 
<br>political stability and therefore, it continues to hold a 
<br>firm line against listing, despite a growing openness within 
<br>internal security circles to acknowledge that Hezbollah has 
<br>committed terrorist acts and should be considered a terrorist 
<br>organization. An approach that combines convincing the GOF 
<br>of a case's merits and, where necessary, isolating France 
<br>diplomatically offers the best chance of success, although in 
<br>this particular situation, it will prove difficult to 
<br>overcome the firm conviction of President Chirac and others 
<br>that designating Hezbollah is a bad idea. Nevertheless, 
<br>France's intelligence and security services must be persuaded 
<br>by the existing evidence that Hezbollah is a terrorist 
<br>organization. Presenting the GOF with evidence of Hezbollah 
<br>involvement in terrorism in the West Bank and Gaza is 
<br>particularly important, as the GOF cannot overlook 
<br>Hezbollah's efforts to destroy the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
<br>process. Having the Palestinian leadership weigh in with the 
<br>French at a high level would be important as well; up to now, 
<br>the French have maintained that only the U.S. and Israel are 
<br>pressing them on Hezbollah, while the Palestinians remain in 
<br>the background on the issue. Second, France must be isolated 
<br>within the EU Clearinghouse. A number of EU countries hide 
<br>behind France's strong opposition, but if they are peeled 
<br>away, France may be more amenable. In general, France does 
<br>not like to be seen publicly as blocking consensus, a fact 
<br>that worked to our advantage in finally convincing the EU to 
<br>designate Hamas. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) The Embassy believes that a gap in French C/T planning 
<br>is its development of mass-casualty emergency response. The 
<br>GOF understands they have improvements to make and have begun 
<br>to conduct exercises to build and test their emergency 
<br>response capabilities. However, France could benefit from 
<br>observing the USG crisis simulation exercises. Post would 
<br>recommend, therefore, for the invitation (where possible) for 
<br>a GOF official to observe USG exercises and simulations. One 
<br>good recent example is the inclusion of two high-level French 
<br>officials as observers to the TOPOFF 3 simulation in the U.S. 
<br>Expanding on this worthy initiative, Washington might 
<br>consider inviting French officials as observers to other, 
<br>similar simulations in the U.S. and abroad, to include USG 
<br>training programs with other countries (such as those 
<br>referenced in Jakarta 4212). The French can be prickly if 
<br>given the impression that they need to be "trained" and in 
<br>addition, giving them decision-making roles is often best 
<br>avoided. One way to overcome these issues is to focus on 
<br>"professional exchanges" and invite them to observe 
<br>USG-organized emergency response simulations and allow them 
<br>to translate best practices to the French system. In 
<br>addition, Post will work to procure invitations for the USG 
<br>to observe French-led crisis simulations. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) As mentioned in para 1, U.S.-French C/T cooperation is 
<br>largely removed from daily political and diplomatic 
<br>pressures. One reason for this is that GOF counter-terrorism 
<br>is itself separated from the rest of the government. 
<br>France's intelligence-related agencies and coordinating 
<br>bodies - of which the DST, the RG, the DGSE and the SGDN are 
<br>primary examples - all deal with terrorism (although the DST 
<br>has a primary role domestically), but their investigations 
<br>and cases are guarded carefully and rarely shared with the 
<br>rest of the GOF. Similarly, the renowned terrorism 
<br>investigating judges - led by Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere - 
<br>operate in a different world than that of the rest of the 
<br>judiciary. In short, the GOF counter-terrorism community is 
<br>highly professional, but insular and centralized in Paris. 
<br>Because of this, judiciary and police services not directly 
<br>involved in counter-terrorism (but who may play an indirect 
<br>support role) have a largely insufficient understanding of 
<br>USG counter-terrorism policy and the judicial/investigative 
<br>procedures that frame this policy. To replace working-level 
<br>and upper management, France's counter-terrorism community 
<br>draws upon the available pool of judicial and security 
<br>professionals, many of whom have little understanding of the 
<br>U.S., its judicial/law enforcement system, and its law 
<br>enforcement organizational structure and resource 
<br>allocations. We need to reach these judicial and security 
<br>professionals as they begin their careers, and not only when 
<br>they enter the counter-terrorism community, sometimes with 
<br>already-formed prejudices. To this end, Post proposes 
<br>approaching the National Magistrate School, other 
<br>professional academies, and programs for already serving law 
<br>enforcement officials with offers to deliver lectures on U.S. 
<br>approaches to terrorism and law enforcement. We would 
<br>request assistance from Washington in developing these 
<br>proposals. Although in this case, results would probably not 
<br>be immediate, in the long run, the USG would have much to 
<br>gain by exposing French judicial and security professionals 
<br>to the U.S. counter-terrorism and law enforcement system at 
<br>an early stage in their careers.
