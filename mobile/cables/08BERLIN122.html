<br>Electoral Fever Puts Pressure on Coalition 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) NSA Hadley:  Mission Germany looks forward to 
<br>welcoming you to Berlin January 31 to February 1.  Germany is 
<br>currently consumed by the aftermath of bitterly fought state 
<br>elections that took place on January 27 in Hesse and Lower 
<br>Saxony.  They are being seen as barometers for next year's 
<br>nationwide vote.  Although the conservative Christian 
<br>Democrats (CDU) won comfortably in Lower Saxony, the CDU 
<br>suffered a major setback in Hesse, where CDU 
<br>Minister-President Roland Koch ran a divisive election 
<br>campaign that took his party from a commanding lead in early 
<br>polls to a virtual tie with the Social Democratic party 
<br>(SPD).  The country is also digesting the significance of the 
<br>unexpected political gains by the (neo-Communist) Left Party 
<br>and its entry into both Hesse and Lower Saxony parliaments. 
<br>Over the next several weeks, state and national politicians 
<br>will evaluate coalition options, none of which appear to 
<br>please any of the major parties.  The CDU's poor showing in 
<br>Hesse could energize its competitors and lead to further 
<br>domestic partisanship, thereby complicating Chancellor Angela 
<br>Merkel's goal of solidifying the political center in advance 
<br>of the 2009 national elections.  On the other hand, the 
<br>success of CDU Minister-President Christian Wulff's 
<br>relatively low-key, centrist re-election campaign in Lower 
<br>Saxony has been seen as a vindication of Merkel's domestic 
<br>political strategy. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) The outcome of these two state elections, and that of 
<br>the February 24 Hamburg elections, will likely reverberate in 
<br>the day-to-day functioning of the CDU-SPD coalition. 
<br>Already, Merkel's conservatives and Foreign Minister 
<br>Frank-Walter Steinmeier's Social Democrats resemble the 
<br>proverbial couple that hated each other but stayed together 
<br>for the sake of the children:  the lack of any other viable 
<br>coalition options is what sustains the partnership between 
<br>the CDU/CSU and the SPD at this point.  On key priorities 
<br>like Afghanistan and Kosovo (and on certain aspects of Iran), 
<br>the gap between Merkel and Steinmeier is not so wide, and 
<br>cooperation with the U.S. has not been harmed by domestic 
<br>politics.  Differences are becoming more evident on some 
<br>foreign policy issues however:  Steinmeier's January 17 
<br>meeting with Syrian Foreign Minister Muallem, over strong 
<br>opposition from the Chancellery, is just the latest example. 
<br>Increasingly, Christoph Heusgen and the Chancellery's small 
<br>staff are being blindsided by the Foreign Ministry on policy 
<br>matters that are significant but outside the spotlight. 
<br>Overall, we can expect Merkel's government to be more 
<br>hamstrung by partisan and interagency rivalries between now 
<br>and the fall of 2009 than was the case in its first two years 
<br>in office. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>Steinmeier's Evolving Political Role 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Steinmeier, who came to office with a reputation as a 
<br>technocrat, is increasingly a political rival to the 
<br>Chancellor.  Like most of his predecessors, he has benefited 
<br>from the visibility conferred on the Foreign Minister.  He 
<br>has become the most popular SPD politician in Germany and the 
<br>second most popular overall, trailing only Merkel.  He 
<br>recently was named Vice Chancellor, was elected as one of 
<br>three national deputy chairmen of the SPD, and announced he 
<br>will run for a federal parliament seat in 2009.  Steinmeier 
<br>is regarded, both within the SPD and among the general 
<br>public, as an attractive possible chancellor candidate in 
<br>2009, should SPD Chairman Kurt Beck stumble. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) With Steinmeier's evolution from technocrat to 
<br>political leader, he must cultivate much greater 
<br>rank-and-file support within the SPD.  This is a particular 
<br>challenge for him, because on domestic issues he is seen as 
<br>relatively conservative.  He was a key architect of Gerhard 
<br>Schroeder's economic reforms and stood by with a studied 
<br>detachment as Kurt Beck and the SPD's left wing began to roll 
<br>them back last fall.  This is all the more reason for 
<br>Steinmeier to seek out foreign policy issues like arms 
<br>control and disarmament on which he can strike chords that 
<br>resonate with SPD voters (regardless of the shortcomings we 
<br>find in these ideas).  Similarly, in policy toward Russia, 
<br>the former Soviet republics, and the Middle East, Steinmeier 
<br>misses no opportunity to evoke the legacy of Willy Brandt, 
<br>elevating dialog and economic engagement above open 
<br>expression of disagreement as tools of diplomacy. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) These internal factors amplify the tendency of 
<br>Steinmeier and his Foreign Office to pursue initiatives not 
<br>in harmony with the Chancellor's instincts or policy 
<br>preferences.  Germany has a weak foreign policy coordination 
<br>process and the German constitution grants broad autonomy to 
<br>ministers.  Therefore, the ability of the Chancellor and her 
<br>staff to rein in the Foreign Office is limited.  A result is 
<br>that Germany does not always speak with a single, clear voice. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>IRAN: Importance of International Cooperation 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) Although Merkel and the Chancellery have more 
<br>consistently toed our common firm line on Iran, both the 
<br>Chancellery and the Foreign Office are firmly committed to 
<br>securing a third UNSCR sanctions resolution as a basis for 
<br>more biting EU autonomous measures.  MFA officials called the 
<br>January 22 P5 1 Ministerial a success in demonstrating unity 
<br>among the members, both by producing a new UNSC resolution 
<br>text and by showing a unified strategic approach in dealing 
<br>with Iran.  MFA officials have told us in private that EU 
<br>autonomous sanctions would not be discussed at the January 
<br>28-29 GAERC.  In conversations prior to January 22, German 
<br>officials have emphasized the importance of the broadest 
<br>possible international coalition, and thus highly value 
<br>efforts to keep all members of the P5-plus-1 on board, 
<br>deploying this argument when approached about either 
<br>unilateral or EU autonomous measures.  However, they point to 
<br>pressures from their business community (as well as from the 
<br>Finance and Economics Ministries) as constraints on adopting 
<br>stronger unilateral action against the Iranian regime. 
<br>Privately, senior officials in the Chancellery and Foreign 
<br>Office have expressed frustration that the NIE has 
<br>complicated international diplomatic efforts.  On December 4, 
<br>FM Steinmeier said the NIE on Iran offered the chance "inject 
<br>new momentum" into the nuclear negotiations and called on all 
<br>sides not to squander this opportunity.  Merkel said publicly 
<br>on January 15 that the NIE had slowed the momentum behind 
<br>further UN sanctions; she simultaneously underscored the 
<br>seriousness of Iran's nuclear activities and the need for 
<br>international solidarity. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>AFGHANISTAN: Need for Broader Deployment 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Encouraging greater German involvement in Afghanistan 
<br>is a key priority of Mission Germany; we have made some 
<br>progress, but the Germans remain very reluctant about 
<br>deploying combat forces outside of the North.  In advance of 
<br>the April NATO Summit, Germany will increase its involvement 
<br>in the training of the Afghan National Army and will probably 
<br>agree to take over responsibility for the 150-man quick 
<br>reaction force (QRF) in the north.  We should welcome the QRF 
<br>decision, because it would represent the first German ISAF 
<br>contingent deployable on short notice (including possibly in 
<br>exceptional and temporary circumstances outside the north), 
<br>which would be a qualitatively new and significant step 
<br>toward greater involvement in kinetic operations.  Secretary 
<br>Gates' recent written request to Defense Minister Jung to 
<br>deploy German Special Operations Forces (SOF) under ISAF in 
<br>the south of Afghanistan is likely to be very controversial 
<br>here, but may prove acceptable in the end if, in return, we 
<br>were to offer Germany the option of ending its current offer 
<br>of SOF for OEF.  Moving the German SOF commitment from OEF to 
<br>ISAF would also have the benefit of allowing us to shift the 
<br>considerable diplomatic resources and attention we devoted 
<br>last fall to getting the German OEF mandate renewed to 
<br>activities that may yield more practical benefits, such as 
<br>pressing Germany to increase its contributions to ISAF. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) We should encourage greater German leadership in the 
<br>EUPOL effort to train Afghanistan's civilian police force. 
<br>EUPOL is led by German Juergen Scholz, and Germany 
<br>contributes more police trainers than any other EU country, 
<br>but the program has been slow to start and the planned 
<br>ceiling of 195 EU police trainers is inadequate for the job. 
<br>Furthermore, activities are not currently planned at the 
<br>district level where the need is greatest.  Germany should be 
<br>urged to accelerate the deployment of EU trainers to 
<br>Afghanistan, increase the number of trainers, and broaden the 
<br>geographic range of activities. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>RUSSIA: Split Approaches 
<br>------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) There are significant differences between the 
<br>Chancellery and the Foreign Office on Russia, which invites 
<br>Russian wedge-driving.  Merkel has never shied away from 
<br>plain talk about disturbing trends inside Russia.  Steinmeier 
<br>was the first foreign visitor to get a meeting with 
<br>presidential candidate Medvedev after his nomination (a 
<br>meeting with President Putin was thrown in as well).  Lately, 
<br>the combination of Russian CFE suspension, backsliding on 
<br>democracy, and intransigence on Kosovo has pushed even some 
<br>in the SPD to offer criticism.  Still, the Foreign Ministry 
<br>will likely continue to seek an unhelpful bridging role with 
<br>Russia, in particular on CFE and other matters related to 
<br>arms control.  The Chancellery can help constrain these 
<br>impulses, but we will also need to keep up pressure among the 
<br>Quad partners as well as from other key allies (e.g. Turkey 
<br>and Norway) to make clear that German unilateral initiatives 
<br>put transatlantic solidarity at risk. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>KOSOVO: Close Cooperation 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) We discern very little daylight between the 
<br>Chancellor and Steinmeier on Kosovo, and there is keen 
<br>interest in working closely with the U.S. to resolve status 
<br>and seal the EU's leadership role.  While the Bundestag will 
<br>engage in intensive debate following an anticipated 
<br>coordinated declaration of independence, we expect the 
<br>multiparty consensus in favor of independence and the KFOR 
<br>and ESDP missions to hold. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>COUNTERTERRORISM: Building on Success 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Your visit comes at a time when U.S.-German bilateral 
<br>cooperation on security issues is as close as it has ever 
<br>been.  The successful cooperation surrounding the 
<br>September 4 arrests of three individuals planning large-scale 
<br>attacks and the upcoming conclusion of a new bilateral 
<br>agreement on fingerprint, DNA and other data sharing are the 
<br>latest evidence of this trend.  Furthermore, no German senior 
<br>official pushes as hard, or argues so publicly, for closer 
<br>bilateral cooperation on security issues as Interior Minister 
<br>Wolfgang Schaeuble.  Should the opportunity arise, you should 
<br>inform German officials that we are eager to build on our 
<br>successful record of counterterrorism cooperation and explore 
<br>how we might work together to address threats such as 
<br>European residents who seek terrorist training at overseas 
<br>camps and become jihadists in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>ECONOMICS: Commitment to TEC 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Merkel highly values the U.S.-EU Transatlantic 
<br>Economic Council (TEC) -- a centerpiece of her 2007 EU 
<br>presidency -- aimed at reducing regulatory barriers to 
<br>transatlantic trade and investment.  She is concerned, 
<br>however, about maintaining the momentum in the TEC and fears 
<br>that the European Commission and future EU presidencies 
<br>(including France) may lose enthusiasm for the project. 
<br>German officials also worry that a changing U.S. 
<br>Administration could derail what they regard as a highly 
<br>successful new transatlantic economic instrument; we should 
<br>emphasize our continued commitment to the TEC, and encourage 
<br>the Germans to maintain a leading role in it.  The German 
<br>economy is expected to grow at only 1.7 percent this year. 
<br>Previous higher estimates were lowered due to rising oil 
<br>prices, the strength of the Euro, slower U.S. growth, and 
<br>continuing turmoil in financial markets.  German economists 
<br>and business leaders are also worried about the possibility 
<br>of a national minimum wage as well as increased labor union 
<br>demands for wage increases, both of which could affect the 
<br>economy adversely.  Merkel plans to highlight employment 
<br>gains -- as opposed to minimum wages -- as the focus of her 
<br>economic plan looking ahead to the 2009 national elections. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>CLIMATE CHANGE: Aggressive Measures 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Chancellor Merkel and the rest of Germany's political 
<br>leadership remain serious about pursuing aggressive 
<br>international measures to meet the challenges of global 
<br>warming.  Merkel has made climate change a priority of her 
<br>Chancellorship and enjoys the overwhelming domestic support 
<br>on this.  Merkel's support for mandatory, targeted global 
<br>limits on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and an international 
<br>cap-and-trade regime reflects a deep-seated belief that only 
<br>drastic, concerted efforts on the part of the international 
<br>community can slow -- and ultimately reverse -- the human 
<br>contribution to global warming.  If anything, Steinmeier 
<br>supports tougher standards.  While the Germans have been 
<br>willing to consider alternative solutions, such as new 
<br>technologies for clean coal and renewables, fundamental 
<br>differences in our approaches to the issue of climate change 
<br>remain, and could lead to more public disagreement in the 
<br>future.  For example, while Germany will send a delegation to 
<br>the January 30 Major Economies Meeting (MEM), the German 
<br>Government remains skeptical about the value that the Major 
<br>Economies Process (MEP) adds to the UNFCCC track. The Germans 
<br>are particularly concerned about the need to avoid 
<br>duplication of effort in the various other climate 
<br>change-related forums, including the UNFCCC and the G-8.
