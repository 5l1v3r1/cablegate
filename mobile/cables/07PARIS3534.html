<br>SUBJECT: FRENCH MFA "REFLECTING" ON IMPLICATIONS OF 
<br>KOUCHNER'S VISIT TO IRAQ 
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Councelor Josiah Rosenblatt for reaso ns 1.4. (b), (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: French FM Kouchner's visit to Iraq allowed 
<br>France to re-engage meaningfully with a wide range of Iraqi 
<br>political and confessional/ethnic leaders and left Kouchner 
<br>"moved" by the extent of destruction in that country. The 
<br>French MFA told us August 24 that Kouchner and his staff are 
<br>still "reflecting" over the visit as they decide how to 
<br>follow up. Kouchner's interlocutors received his message of 
<br>solidarity and desire to help with appreciation. Kouchner 
<br>also took pains to dissociate his visit from the USG and 
<br>denied any link to the meeting in Maine between Presidents 
<br>Bush and Sarkozy. The MFA denies Kouchner formally offered 
<br>to organize a dialogue among Iraqis and believes the press 
<br>has exaggerated the importance of some public musing on 
<br>Kouchner's part. France will reach out to the EU in support 
<br>of a new multilateral initiative. The MFA expects to be in 
<br>touch with the USG as well, although it may wait to see how 
<br>things play out in Washington in response to the Petraeus 
<br>report. The contours of French thinking should be clearer by 
<br>the time of the UNGA, which will be no coincidence given 
<br>Kouchner's desire to place the UN at the head of a 
<br>multinational effort for Iraqi reconstruction. One concrete 
<br>result of the visit was Kouchner's decision to proceed with 
<br>stalled plans to establish a French "embassy office" in 
<br>Irbil; for budget and other administrative reasons, however, 
<br>it is unclear when it will be set up. End summary 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) French MFA Iraq desk officer Olivier Masseret 
<br>provided a readout August 24 of FM Kouchner's visit to Iraq 
<br>August 19-21. His main points, a number of which have been 
<br>made in the press, included: 
<br>
<br>--The visit was entirely at Kouchner's initiative and was in 
<br>no way tied to the meeting in Maine between Presidents Bush 
<br>and Sarkozy. Masseret recalled Kouchner's longstanding ties 
<br>to Kurdish leader and current former President of Iraq Jalal 
<br>Talabani, who had been pressing Kouchner to visit since 
<br>Kouchner became foreign minister. 
<br>
<br>--Making it clear that the visit in no way occurred at the 
<br>request of the U.S. or in furtherance of U.S. policies was 
<br>something Kouchner stressed with each of his interlocutors. 
<br>Masseret complained that it has been hard to shake the press 
<br>from the false but understandable impression that Presidents 
<br>Bush and Sarkozy had discussed or approved the visit when 
<br>they met in Maine. Kouchner also carried with him a copy of 
<br>an editorial he wrote before the March 2003 invasion entitled 
<br>"Neither Saddam nor War" to correct the misimpression that 
<br>Kouchner had supported U.S. military force to remove Saddam 
<br>Hussein. 
<br>
<br>--Kouchner's jam-packed schedule included meetings with 
<br>nearly every political leader and just about every 
<br>confessional grouping. Masseret indicated that Kouchner knew 
<br>he had some work to do rebuilding France's image. This 
<br>included dispelling the notion that France still harbors some 
<br>nostalgia for the days when Iraq's Sunnis dominated the 
<br>political scene. Masseret sought to correct the 
<br>misimpression that Kouchner only had contacts among Kurds to 
<br>say that this visit revealed to many for the first time that 
<br>he was well known in all the major ethnic and confessional 
<br>groups. 
<br>
<br>--Iraqi leaders responded well to Kouchner's core message of 
<br>solidarity with the Iraqi people's suffering, readiness to 
<br>listen and help, and commitment to turning the page in the 
<br>Iraqi/French relationship. There was some grousing about 
<br>France's policy under President Chirac, but even that seemed 
<br>pro forma. If anything, according to Masseret, the angriest 
<br>sentiment Iraqis expressed was that France had waited so long 
<br>after Saddam Hussein's fall to re-engage meaningfully. 
<br>
<br>--If anything impressed Kouchner, it was the absolute 
<br>devastation that marked Iraq in all spheres, especially the 
<br>economic and social. This fueled Kouchner's view, as 
<br>expressed publicly, that Iraq's ongoing crisis was not merely 
<br>a national tragedy but a catastrophe whose already dramatic 
<br>regional implications are only increasing. Masseret said it 
<br>may seem simplistic, but the visit was an eye-opening and 
<br>moving experience for Kouchner. In particular, the plight of 
<br>Iraq's Christians touched Kouchner because of the escalating 
<br>persecution they seem to face. (Comment: This was a point 
<br>Kouchner made in an interview on one of the nightly national 
<br>newscasts. End comment) 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Kouchner and his staff are now reflecting on the 
<br>visit and trying to figure out what to make France's focus 
<br>and how best to rally European and other international 
<br>support. Masseret dismissed press speculation about a 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00003534 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>possible French-hosted gathering of Iraqi leaders along the 
<br>lines of the intra-Lebanese dialogue Kouchner initiated. He 
<br>explained that Kouchner did muse to reporters that France 
<br>would be open to creating a safe space for competing factions 
<br>to meet, but it was no more concrete than that. He denied 
<br>that Kouchner made the offer in his various meetings and 
<br>agreed that President Talabani's rejection of such an 
<br>initiative effectively took it off the table at least for 
<br>now. The bottom line for Kouchner, Masseret continued, was 
<br>that anything France does add real value and not appear to 
<br>another case of France off on its own pursuing objectives 
<br>that had no other buy-in. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Masseret spoke of the UN angle, which is 
<br>symbolically and ideologically important to Kouchner. As 
<br>reported in the media, Masseret spoke of Kouchner's 
<br>insistence on arriving in Baghdad exactly four years after 
<br>the bombing of the UN compound that killed his friend Sergio 
<br>de Mello and many former colleagues from Kouchner's days 
<br>directing UN efforts in Kosovo. Kouchner further insisted 
<br>that his first official act in Bagdhad be the laying of a 
<br>wreath at the site of the bombing to honor the fallen. It 
<br>was not clear to Masseret how the UN will fit into Kouchner's 
<br>thinking, but press reports were right to highlight the key 
<br>role he will want it to play in any concerted multilateral 
<br>effort. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) How Europe will fit into French ideas for the way 
<br>forward in Iraq is a central aspect of evolving French 
<br>thinking. Masseret would not comment on press reports of 
<br>tepid responses by many of Kouchner's EU colleagues in 
<br>response to his encouragement that they follow his lead. 
<br>Europe, however, will be key should France seek to mobilize a 
<br>more robust UN presence and effort in Iraq. Although there 
<br>are no plans just yet, France will seek an appropriate EU 
<br>ministerial to discuss increased and concerted support for 
<br>Iraq. Masseret said that Kouchner will need to convince his 
<br>colleagues that this is not just another instance of France 
<br>going off on its own but something that has implications for 
<br>EU interests in the Middle East. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Working with the U.S. is another subject under 
<br>discussion. Masseret said that Kouchner wants to consult 
<br>with the Secretary, as he did August 24, on a regular basis 
<br>but preserve France's independence. This includes its 
<br>ability to speak its mind when and as it deems necessary. 
<br>Agreeing that the visit arguably transformed the Iraq issue 
<br>from being a subject of disagreement to one about which we 
<br>could have a useful dialogue, the MFA will probably not have 
<br>recommendations on what to say to the U.S. until the current 
<br>"reflection" period ends. While not saying how long that 
<br>might last, he surmised that France will be ready to talk to 
<br>us and others about Iraq on the margins of the UNGA in late 
<br>September. Noting the release of the Petraeus report in 
<br>mid-September, Masseret expected it would inform French 
<br>thinking not merely for its content but also for its impact 
<br>on U.S. policy afterward. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) One area of U.S./French cooperation Masseret praised 
<br>effusively was the outstanding help provided for Kouchner's 
<br>visit by Baghdad Deputy Polcouns Rob Waller (on a one-year 
<br>TDY from his job as Paris NEA watcher). His role was vital 
<br>in ensuring coordination of security and other logistical 
<br>arrangements. (Comment: The acting director of the MFA's 
<br>equivalent to our NEA bureau echoed this point in a separate 
<br>encounter.) 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) As a final note, Masseret confirmed tentative press 
<br>reporting that the MFA is now committed to the idea of 
<br>opening an "embassy office" in Irbil. He elaborated that it 
<br>would be lightly staffed -- a sort of "French presence post" 
<br>-- and not expected to handle consular duties (too few French 
<br>citizens in northern Iraq, no desire to take on visa work in 
<br>Irbil). When asked about the timeframe, Masseret was vague, 
<br>citing budgetary and other "administrative" issues that 
<br>needed to be worked out. Another problem arose after 
<br>Kouchner started informing his interlocutors of the office in 
<br>Irbil as Shi'a contacts pressed for a similar office in Basra 
<br>for "balance." Kouchner made a vague commitment to do what 
<br>he could, but Masseret stated the security situation in Basra 
<br>at the moment clearly ruled that idea out of the question.
