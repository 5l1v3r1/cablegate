<br>SUBJECT: INTER-KOREAN RED CROSS TALKS ON FAMILY
<br>REUNIFICATION
<br>
<br>Classified By: POL M/C James L. Wayman. Reasons 1.4(b/d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The North Korean delegation to the August
<br>26-28 inter-Korean Red Cross talks showed up armed with
<br>instructions from Kim Jong-il (KJI) to agree immediately to
<br>family reunions by Chusok (Korean Thanksgiving, October 2-3),
<br>but was not prepared to negotiate additional reunions.
<br>Ministry of Unification (MOU) xxxxx that,
<br>angling for food assistance, the DPRK delegation asked
<br>whether the ROKG brought a "gift," the ROKG responded that
<br>such aid would be premature. In a separate meeting, an MOU
<br>official described the mechanics of the family reunion
<br>process, noting that the DPRK gathered its participants in
<br>Pyongyang for a month of fattening up and indoctrination
<br>prior to the family reunification. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------
<br>KJI: Green Light for Chusok Deadline, but Nothing Beyond
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) xxxxx, who
<br>recently returned xxxxx
<br>xxxxx at Mount Kumgang. xxxxx, a seasoned MOU officer
<br>who participated in previous negotiations with the DPRK, said
<br>he was surprised that DPRK head delegate Choi Sung-ik was
<br>unusually cooperative during this round of talks. Choi,
<br>infamous throughout the ROKG for his gruff demeanor and tough
<br>tactics, came to the table emphasizing he was authorized by
<br>Kim Jong-il (KJI) to "meet the Chusok deadline." The North
<br>Korean delegation, however, was not authorized by KJI to
<br>discuss anything beyond October.
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>DPRK Asks About Food "Gift"
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) According xxxxx, the DPRK delegation inquired whether
<br>the South Korean delegation had brought a "gift," hinting
<br>that they were expecting food aid. The ROK delegation
<br>responded that it was "premature" for such an arrangement.
<br>xxxxx noted that this was a big change, pointing out that
<br>during the past 16 rounds of Red Cross negotiations, the ROKG
<br>always asked for the family reunions and rewarded the DPRK
<br>with rice and fertilizer aid. This time, however, the
<br>reunion suggestion came from the DPRK and the ROKG did not,
<br>and has no plans to, offer food aid.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>Atmospherics: Food Shipped in from Pyongyang
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Addressing atmospherics during the talks, xxxxx said the
<br>two sides came to an impasse when the DPRK delegation pushed
<br>hard for the resumption of Mount Kumgang tours. They argued
<br>that KJI had given his oral guarantee that ROK citizens would
<br>be safe and "nothing could be more secure" than KJI's word.
<br>The ROK delegation pushed back, asking for a written
<br>guarantee. The impasse was broken when the ROK side inquired
<br>whether the resumption of Kumgang tours was a prerequisite
<br>for the Chusok family reunions; the DPRK delegation said no.
<br>(xxxxx added that he suspects some kind of amendment to
<br>the 2004 security agreement for Mt. Kumkang tours will be
<br>reached in the near future as a compromise. End note.)
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) xxxxx, both delegations took turns hosting
<br>dinner for the two nights they spent at Mount Kumgang. He
<br>said the hotel and kitchen personnel were hired "in a hurry"
<br>from nearby villages and food was shipped in from Pyongyang.
<br>xxxxx noted that the ROK delegation was charged USD 50 per
<br>person for hosting its 70-person banquet, a price that in
<br>fact covered the tab for the banquet hosted by the DPRK
<br>delegation the previous evening.
<br>
<br>------------
<br>Carrot Time?
<br>------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) xxxxx related that following the Red Cross talks, the
<br>ROKG has been reviewing what, if any, "carrots" should be
<br>offered to the DPRK for its string of conciliatory gestures.
<br>According xxxxx, senior MOU officials recognize that North
<br>Korea's goodwill is cyclical, but also want to acknowledge
<br>that DPRK has done "all that it could do, except for
<br>denuclearization," during the past few weeks. xxxxx said that
<br>the ROKG was carefully observing developments in U.S.-DPRK
<br>relations and emphasized that Seoul would come up with a
<br>
<br>position "not too far" from Washington's position.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>Potemkin: Fattening Up the Reliable Relatives
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) xxxxx walked us through the mechanics of what comes next
<br>in the family reunion process. xxxxx explained that the two
<br>Koreas exchanged a list of 200 names each on September 1; the
<br>ROKG picked its families by lottery, the DPRK by political
<br>reliability. xxxxx explained that each government would then
<br>search for relatives of those on the lists. In the past, he
<br>said, about half of the participating ROK families received
<br>confirmation from the DPRK that their relatives were alive
<br>and were then able to hold unifications. The rest of the ROK
<br>families received death confirmations or the ambiguous word
<br>"unconfirmed."
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxx asserted that once the DPRK identifies
<br>politically reliable family members to participate in the
<br>upcoming reunions, they will be transported to Pyongyang and
<br>then "fattened up" with regular meals and vitamins to mask
<br>the extent of food shortages and chronic malnutrition in the
<br>north. The "lucky" DPRK reunion participants will also be
<br>provided with new clothing -- suits for men and traditional
<br>Korean "hanbok" for women -- for the televised event. In our
<br>earlier meeting, xxxxx had commented that MOU gives "pocket
<br>and travel money" to ROK participants which they then pass on
<br>to their North Korean relatives. xxxxx sighed that the
<br>majority of the MOU cash is usually pocketed by North Korean
<br>officials, who also force the North Korean participants to
<br>return their new clothes.
