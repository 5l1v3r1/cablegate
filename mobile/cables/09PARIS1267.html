<br>SUBJECT: HADOPI 2: French Assembly Approves Internet Piracy 
<br>Sanctions Bill 
<br>
<br>Ref: Paris 559 
<br>
<br>¶1. On September 15, the French National Assembly approved the 
<br>sanctions' portion of the GOF's disputed Internet piracy law by 285 
<br>votes in favor and 225 against (including some members of the UMP 
<br>majority party. Nicknamed "Hadopi 2," this draft bill complements 
<br>the law "Creation and the Internet" passed in June (Hadopi 
<br>1)(Reftel). Hadopi 2 provides for two written warnings and then 
<br>suspension of internet access by a judge. A joint parliamentarian 
<br>committee will hold a final vote on the bill on September 22. 
<br>
<br>¶2. The Socialist Party has already announced that it will challenge 
<br>Hadopi 2 in front of the Constitutional Council, notably because 
<br>they believe the bill's ordonnance pnale deprives potential 
<br>offenders of the ability to defend themselves properly. Record 
<br>companies, film producers and artists have supported the 
<br>government's bid to crack down on Internet piracy. Recording 
<br>industry organization SNEP estimates that it has destroyed 50 
<br>percent of the value of the French recorded music market in six 
<br>years. Other French organizations representing major and 
<br>independent labels, songwriters and publishers noted that the new 
<br>legislation "should put an end to years of laissez-faire resulting 
<br>in a sharp erosion of their income." The original Hadopi 1 bill 
<br>includes an elaborate system of sanctions devised to that effect and 
<br>ranges from a 1,500-euro fine and a month-long suspension for 
<br>allowing a third party to pirate music or films using their web 
<br>connection, to 300,000 euros in fines and three years imprisonment 
<br>for counterfeiters. 
<br>
<br>¶3. French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand, who pushed for this 
<br>bill last summer, stressed that artists would "remember that we had 
<br>the political courage to finally break the laissez-faire attitude, 
<br>and to protect their rights from those who want to turn the Internet 
<br>into a ground for their libertarian utopia." Last week, Mitterand 
<br>announced he would submit a bill (Hadopi 3) to improve online legal 
<br>offerings by the end of the year. "By then, Hadopi 1 and 2 will be 
<br>operational," he said. Mitterand appointed Patrick Zelnik, CEO of 
<br>French independent label Naove, which produces Carla Bruni's music, 
<br>to develop the Hadopi 3 proposals. In the meantime, "Parti Pirate," 
<br>the first French affiliate of Piracy Pirate International, will 
<br>present a candidate in the September 20 interim election for a 
<br>vacant seat in the National Assembly.
