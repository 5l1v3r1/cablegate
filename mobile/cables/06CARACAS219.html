<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S//NF) As noted in REF A, the Venezuelan relationship 
<br>with Cuba continues to intensify. Thousands of personnel 
<br>sent by the Cuban Government are involved in the Venezuelan 
<br>health sector and other BRV social missions. Cubans 
<br>cooperate extensively with Venezuelan intelligence services. 
<br>Cubans may also participate heavily in the BRV's efforts to 
<br>naturalize foreigners and provide documentation for citizens, 
<br>according to various reports from Embassy contacts. Cubans' 
<br>roles in the military are less clear but probably are also 
<br>less significant. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Venezuelans' views of individual Cubans are mixed. 
<br>Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez appears to be trying to 
<br>promote the involvement of Cubans in Venezuelan society, 
<br>although he has proceeded slowly and carefully. Anti-Chavez 
<br>politicians have barked up the wrong tree by decrying Cuban 
<br>communism and sovereignty violations, issues that simply do 
<br>not resonate with poor Venezuelans. While the economic 
<br>impact of Cubans working in Venezuela may be limited, Cuban 
<br>intelligence has much to offer to Venezuela's anti-U.S. 
<br>intelligence services. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>How Many Cubans? 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Although the numbers of Cubans sent by the GOC to 
<br>work in Venezuela are significant, the exact figures are 
<br>difficult to establish. Embassy officers have noted regular 
<br>flights of Cubans--or Venezuelans returning from official 
<br>visits to Cuba--at Caracas's Maiquetia airport. According to 
<br>a DOD analysis of flight activity, an average of about 350 
<br>people arrive on three to five commercial or military flights 
<br>from Cuba to Venezuela per day. Most of these flights land 
<br>at Maiquetia, but Barcelona and Maracaibo are also common 
<br>destinations. Post cannot determine how many Cubans are on 
<br>the flights or how many passengers stay in Venezuela 
<br>permanently. Airport officials spirit passengers through the 
<br>building without stopping in customs or immigration. ONIDEX, 
<br>Venezuela's National Office of Identification and 
<br>Immigration, reports that it naturalized only 12 Cubans out 
<br>of a group of 22,664 persons naturalized in December 2005. 
<br>Whether or not they enjoy Venezuelan citizenship, however, 
<br>thousands of Cubans have Venezuelan documentation. In 
<br>addition to the over 20,000 Cubans involved in the Venezuelan 
<br>health sector (see below), less reliable reports indicate 
<br>that thousands more are active in the Venezuelan interior. 
<br>Manuel Rosales, the opposition Governor of Zulia State, told 
<br>the DCM in October 2005 that 20,000 Cubans resided in Zulia 
<br>alone. Former National Assembly deputy Pedro Pablo Alcantara 
<br>(Accion Democratica) told us in October that Lara State had 
<br>the most Cubans per capita in Venezuela. He claimed more 
<br>flights from Havana arrived in Barquisimeto, Lara than in 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000219 002 OF 006 
<br>
<br>
<br>Caracas. Complicating the matter further are some 30,000 
<br>Cuban exiles in Venezuela, the Cuban exile NGO Net for Cuba 
<br>estimates. 
<br>
<br>------ 
<br>Health 
<br>------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The BRV created Mision Barrio Adentro (Inside the 
<br>Neighborhood Mission) to provide basic health care for 
<br>disadvantaged neighborhoods in December 2003, shortly after 
<br>signing a bilateral agreement with Cuba to swap oil for 
<br>medical services. As of mid-2005, about 21,000 Cuban 
<br>physicians, nurses, and support staff along with some 6,000 
<br>Venezuelan personnel staffed the mission, according to the 
<br>Ministry of Communication. Mission clinics are small, 
<br>two-story hexagonal structures that also house two to three 
<br>doctors. The BRV provides the clinics' equipment and 
<br>reduced-cost medicines. Through Barrio Adentro, the BRV 
<br>identifies patients eligible for Mision Milagro (Miracle 
<br>Mission), which flies Venezuelans to Havana for cataract 
<br>surgery. Anecdotal reporting suggests the care Cuban doctors 
<br>provide is often lacking and that many "physicians" are 
<br>actually medical students. The BRV has recently begun Mision 
<br>Barrio Adentro II, a network of more advanced diagnostic 
<br>centers and inpatient clinics to be administered and staffed 
<br>mostly by Venezuelans. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Notwithstanding the 90,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil 
<br>Venezuela provides Cuba per day on barter terms, Cuban 
<br>doctors earn relatively little. According to press reports, 
<br>Cuban doctors receive salaries of up to USD 400 per month, a 
<br>figure slightly lower than local averages. A Cuban physician 
<br>told Post's medical advisor, however, that he received room, 
<br>board, and toiletries but that the Cuban Government was 
<br>"holding" his salary until he finished his two-year tour. 
<br>Some Cuban doctors have "deserted" and fled. A European 
<br>diplomat told polcouns in mid-January 2006 that the number of 
<br>Cuban asylum requests received by EU missions in Venezuela 
<br>had increased over the past few months. A local legislator 
<br>with extensive contacts in poor neighborhoods told us in 
<br>November 2005 that Cuban doctors complained bitterly that the 
<br>Cuban regime held their families hostage while the doctors 
<br>relied on local donations to survive. In contrast, according 
<br>to REF B, the GOC receives from Venezuela between USD 1,000 
<br>to 5,000 for each Mision Milagro cataract operation, which is 
<br>comparable to the roughly USD 3,500 that a Venezuelan private 
<br>clinic would charge for the procedure. 
<br>
<br>------------ 
<br>Intelligence 
<br>------------ 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S//NF) Sensitive reports indicate Cuban and Venezuelan 
<br>intelligence ties are so advanced that the two countries' 
<br>agencies appear to be competing with each other for the BRV's 
<br>attention. Cuban intelligence officers have direct access to 
<br>Chavez and frequently provide him with intelligence reporting 
<br>unvetted by Venezuelan officers. Venezuela's Directorate of 
<br>Intelligence and Prevention Services (DISIP), moreover, may 
<br>be taking advice from Cuban intelligence on the formation of 
<br>a new intelligence service (REF C). Cuban intelligence 
<br>officers train Venezuelans both in Cuba and in Venezuela, 
<br>providing both political indoctrination and operational 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000219 003 OF 006 
<br>
<br>
<br>instruction. They also may work in other Venezuelan 
<br>government ministries, unconfirmed sensitive reporting 
<br>suggests. 
<br>
<br>-------- 
<br>Military 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Post has received no credible reports of extensive 
<br>Cuban involvement in the Venezuelan military, despite the 
<br>Venezuelan Armed Forces' attempts to imitate Cuban military 
<br>doctrine and uniforms. According to DAO reports, Cubans 
<br>train and advise Chavez' military security detail. 
<br>Anti-Chavez military officers have told us that Cubans hold 
<br>liaison and personnel exchange positions within the 
<br>Venezuelan military formerly held by European and other Latin 
<br>American officers. Moreover, a few Venezuelan military 
<br>officers--along with some from the Foreign Ministry--undergo 
<br>ideological training in Cuba. Chavez has also sent a 
<br>military team to Cuba construct a complex of 150 houses, 
<br>according to press reports. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>Other Sectors? 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S//NF) Cuban involvement in other agencies and missions 
<br>is harder to confirm. Cubans have been heavily involved in 
<br>ONIDEX, according to various unconfirmed sources. A local 
<br>academic with a background in electoral systems told poloff 
<br>that Venezuelans trained in Cuba helped expand the national 
<br>electoral registry by over two million voters through Mision 
<br>Identidad (Identity Mission) in 2003. He added that the 
<br>Venezuelan process to receive an identity card was a carbon 
<br>copy of the Cuban process. Anti-Chavez military officers 
<br>told us in July 2005 that Cubans helped run ONIDEX and 
<br>reported that an active duty army colonel was running an 
<br>operation to print identity cards for Cubans. According to 
<br>an Embassy employee with access to secure areas of Caracas' 
<br>Maiquetia airport, Cubans hold supervisory positions at the 
<br>airport's auxiliary terminal. Cubans also have established 
<br>and continue to service the airport's biometrics equipment, 
<br>according to sensitive reports. Some anecdotal sensitive 
<br>reporting further suggests Cuban officials had a Venezuelan 
<br>officer dismissed for resisting their attempts to take 
<br>temporary operational control over a section of the airport 
<br>during a visit of Cuban leader Fidel Castro. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Ruben Flores, the editor of a rancher newspaper, 
<br>told poloff in early 2005 that Cuban involvement in the 
<br>agricultural sector was second only to that in the health 
<br>sector. Such a claim may be exaggerated, but Cubans are 
<br>likely involved to a great extent. According to the 
<br>Agricultural Attache, Cuban officials hold senior positions 
<br>in the Ministry of Agriculture and also operate in the 
<br>Venezuelan interior. Citing technical experts in the 
<br>Ministry, Flores told us in January 2006 that Cuban officials 
<br>were helping design Venezuela's "Planting Plan 2006," which 
<br>would prescribe the crops to be sown in each region. Jaime 
<br>Perez Branger, head of the company that owns cattle ranch and 
<br>nature preserve Hato Pinero, told us in January that Cubans 
<br>advised the BRV on agricultural productivity and on setting 
<br>up cooperatives in such missions as Vuelvan Caras. (Vuelvan 
<br>Caras, or "About Face," is a BRV program offering six months 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000219 004 OF 006 
<br>
<br>
<br>of job training, after which participants form cooperatives, 
<br>often in the agricultural sector.) Venezuela, South 
<br>America's only net importer of agricultural products, is also 
<br>setting up Cuban sugar mills in Venezuela in the wake of 
<br>Cuba's failing sugar industry. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Industry contacts have told the Agricultural 
<br>Attache that Cubans helped design and manage Mision Mercal, 
<br>the BRV's subsidized grocery program. An Arthur D. Little 
<br>consultant told us in February 2005 that a Cuban vice 
<br>minister of commerce works with Mercal full-time. Flores 
<br>told poloff in January 2006 that ALIMPORT, Cuba's agency that 
<br>handles all food imports, was advising the BRV on food 
<br>distribution. Venezuela finances some of its own food 
<br>imports through a Havana branch of the Industrial Bank of 
<br>Venezuela, and Chavez' brother Adan Chavez, the Venezuelan 
<br>Ambassador there, may profit illicitly from the loan process, 
<br>according to DAO reporting (REF D). 
<br>
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>Venezuelan Views of Cubans 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Cuban citizens' resentment of Venezuelans (REF A) 
<br>is not completely mutual. Some Venezuelans, including many 
<br>who experienced the infiltration of violent Cuban 
<br>revolutionaries during the 1960s, do dislike Cubans. The 
<br>average Venezuelan's view of Cubans, however, is more 
<br>nuanced. Some poor Venezuelans admire Cubans involved in the 
<br>missions for providing free services. Others, while 
<br>disapproving of their political system, appreciate Cuban 
<br>culture displayed by individual Cubans, especially those 
<br>among the exile community. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Chavez appears to be trying to promote a friendly 
<br>image of Cubans. Cubans have appeared increasingly on public 
<br>television, including on Chavez' "Alo Presidente" show. 
<br>Images of crossed Cuban and Venezuelan flags have also begun 
<br>to appear in Caracas. The polling firm Datanalisis reports 
<br>that Chavez' recent attempts to "sell" the Cuban political 
<br>model may have increased Venezuelans' rejection of the Cuban 
<br>regime from May 2005 (63 percent) to October 2005 (81 
<br>percent). (Embassy note: Whether Chavez' promotion of Cuba 
<br>is paying off or backfiring is unclear. Answers to 
<br>Datanalisis' question, "what do you think of Venezuela taking 
<br>the Cuban regime as a model," may reflect a growing sense of 
<br>nationalism and uniqueness among Venezuelans--consistent with 
<br>Chavez' calls for a "new socialism"--rather than a rejection 
<br>of Cubans. Indeed, almost half of the Chavez supporters 
<br>polled, who would seem least likely to oppose Cuba, responded 
<br>negatively.) 
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Despite the increasing publicity, signs of 
<br>Cuban-Venezuelan partnership in Caracas are not as ubiquitous 
<br>as they apparently are in Havana, and Cubans generally keep a 
<br>low profile. Chavez' sense of self-importance may partly 
<br>explain why Cuba figures less prominently. The "Bolivarian 
<br>Alternative for Latin America" is not a synonym for 
<br>Cuban-Venezuelan cooperation in Venezuela because Chavez 
<br>pitches it as a movement he has launched throughout the 
<br>hemisphere. Chavez features call-ins from Castro during his 
<br>public appearances, such as a mid-January 2006 sendoff for 
<br>Venezuelans going to study medicine in Cuba. Nonetheless, 
<br>Chavez does not part with the spotlight for long. His weekly 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000219 005 OF 006 
<br>
<br>
<br>"Alo Presidente" broadcasts routinely run longer than five 
<br>hours. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>The Opposition Has Failed... 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Some of Chavez' opponents appear to be trying to 
<br>inflame a prejudice against Cubans that is uncommon among 
<br>Venezuelans. They rant about "Cuban invaders" and 
<br>"sovereignty violations" that resonate little with the 
<br>Venezuelan poor. Opposition politicians also berate Chavez 
<br>for attempting to introduce Cuban communism, although few 
<br>Venezuelans believe he will do so. Former opposition 
<br>National Assembly deputy Carlos Casanova (Socialdemocrata) 
<br>told poloff the public's response to the opposition was "look 
<br>around, this isn't communism, chico!" Still, over-the-top 
<br>critiques can impede focused criticism. Asked how the 
<br>opposition could exploit opposition to Chavez' oil "loans" to 
<br>Cuba, Accion Democratica's former international relations 
<br>secretary Alfredo Coronil replied to poloff that Cuba was 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>planning to intervene in Africa after Venezuela, brushing 
<br>aside poloff's remark that Cuba could hardly still afford 
<br>adventurism on a Cold War scale. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) The political opposition does little to exploit 
<br>alleged medical malpractice in Mision Barrio Adentro or to 
<br>report on returning Mision Milagro patients' impressions of 
<br>Cuba. In fact, much of the opposition remains ignorant of 
<br>how such missions work because it does not reach out to poor 
<br>neighborhoods for the most part. One anti-Chavez retired 
<br>military officer, however, told poloff in June 2005 that 
<br>groups of Venezuelan doctors had begun treating people in 
<br>poor areas with the support of certain pharmacies. The scope 
<br>of the initiative is unclear. 
<br>
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>...But Finally Getting the Picture? 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶16. (U) Primero Justicia (PJ) has been the only political 
<br>party to criticize Chavez consistently for his handouts to 
<br>other countries. Promising additional programs to 
<br>redistribute oil wealth, PJ presidential candidate Julio 
<br>Borges has asked the BRV to explain why ordinary Venezuelans 
<br>are not receiving the money sent to Cuba, according to press 
<br>reports. With the closure of the Caracas-La Guaira bridge, 
<br>other elements of the opposition are also beginning to 
<br>contrast BRV gifts abroad with problems at home. An internet 
<br>blog site has displayed the amounts spent on foreign 
<br>infrastructure next to photos of the crumbling bridge. 
<br>During its assembly in mid-January 2006, the Venezuelan 
<br>Episcopal Conference criticized grants and loans the BRV had 
<br>awarded overseas. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) The economic impact of Cubans in Venezuela is mixed 
<br>but limited. (Venezuelan subsidies to Cuba, on the other 
<br>hand, could eventually pose greater problems for the BRV 
<br>(SEPTEL).) By helping the BRV pad its voter rolls and 
<br>naturalize suspicious immigrants, Cubans are doing jobs that 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00000219 006 OF 006 
<br>
<br>
<br>Venezuelan government personnel could and would do in their 
<br>absence. Cuban doctors, however, are treating communities 
<br>mostly unreached by Venezuelan health services. Venezuela 
<br>continues to purchase costly conventional weapons systems 
<br>despite the influence on paper of Cuba's "asymmetric" warfare 
<br>doctrine. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (S//NF) The impact of Cuban involvement in Venezuelan 
<br>intelligence could impact U.S. interests directly. 
<br>Venezuelan intelligence services are among the most hostile 
<br>towards the United States in the hemisphere, but they lack 
<br>the expertise that Cuban services can provide. Cuban 
<br>intelligence routinely provides the BRV intelligence reports 
<br>about the activities of the USG. Cuban dissemination of 
<br>ideological propaganda in Venezuela is less of a threat. 
<br>Chavez, the revolution's most effective proponent, still 
<br>appears to be involving Cubans in public discourse and BRV 
<br>projects with some discretion.<br>
