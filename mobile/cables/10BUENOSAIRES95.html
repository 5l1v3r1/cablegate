<br>Summary
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The GoA issued a decree on February 16 requiring ships to
<br>obtain GoA permission before sailing from Argentina or through
<br>Argentine waters to reach the Falkland/Malvinas Islands. Argentine
<br>President Fernandez de Kirchner sought to justify the decree based
<br>on UN resolutions. The decree is intended to discourage oil
<br>exploration in territorial waters of the islands. British
<br>diplomats in Argentina are seeking to calm the waters, but note
<br>that Argentina has sent warning letters to companies currently
<br>involved in such exploration. They think that there is a real
<br>possibility that the GoA might place sanctions against these
<br>companies, even if Argentine economic interests might be harmed in
<br>the process. While it is unclear to what extent U.S. companies may
<br>be affected, one target may be U.S. tour operators for Southern
<br>Cone and Antarctica cruises that include a stop at the islands.
<br>The British strategy is to let CFK score political points now and
<br>wait for the issue to fade away as the public debate shifts to more
<br>pressing domestic issues. End Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Argentina Requires Ships to Request Permission to Travel to
<br>Falklands/Malvinas
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) On February 16, Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez announced
<br>that President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (CFK) had that day
<br>signed a new decree (Executive Order equivalent) requiring ships to
<br>obtain GoA permission to sail from Argentina or through Argentine
<br>waters to the Falklands/Malvinas and other South Atlantic islands
<br>claimed by Argentina, or before loading cargo destined for them.
<br>According to a GoA press release, it "establishes the requirement
<br>for (GoA) permission to navigate between the Argentine continental
<br>territory and the Malvinas, South Georgia and South Sandwich
<br>Islands." Anibal Fernandez will head a commission (which will
<br>include representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs,
<br>Planning, Industry and Tourism, Economy and Justice) to oversee
<br>implementation of the decree.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) At a public event later in the day, CFK explained that
<br>"all ships that are headed to Puerto Argentino (i.e., Port Stanley)
<br>must request authorization from Argentina, whatever their reason
<br>for going." She justified this new requirement, arguing that
<br>"there are numerous UN resolutions which request and require both
<br>countries (i.e., Argentina and the U.K.) to renew talks to reach an
<br>agreement on sovereignty (of the islands), and resolutions which
<br>say that neither party can take unilateral actions." She added
<br>that "these resolutions have been systematically ignored by the
<br>United Kingdom, which refuses to discuss the matter," and that "the
<br>U.K. refuses to sit at the table to discuss it as the UN orders."
<br>She stated that she would raise the issue at the Rio Group summit
<br>meeting to be held next week in Playa del Carmen, MC)xico.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The Reason: To Raise the Cost of Doing Business in the Islands
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Numerous press reports cited anonymous government sources
<br>with more detailed justifications and explanations of intent.
<br>Leading daily Clarin's source stated that "The ships that go (to
<br>the Falklands to support oil drilling) should know that they won't
<br>get any assistance in Argentine ports." Pro-government daily
<br>Pagina 12's source in the MFA went further, claiming that the goal
<br>was "to make the exploration process more expensive" and thus
<br>discourage firms from operating there. Foreign Minister Taiana, in
<br>a closed-door session with CFK-aligned congressmen, reportedly
<br>
<br>
<br>repeated that last argument, while also expressing the hope that
<br>companies would choose instead to conduct similar activities in
<br>nearby (undisputed) Argentine waters. Another MFA source told
<br>pro-government Pagina 12 that "last Friday, the Financial Times
<br>reported that stock prices (of Desire Petroleum, the British
<br>company leading the exploration efforts) were falling. That is
<br>what our sanctions aim for, always through peaceful and legal
<br>means, so that the risk factor that every petroleum company
<br>(operating in the Islands) faces is increasingly higher."
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) While the decree has yet to be published in its entirety,
<br>the GoA may have already begun to enforce it. A British-flagged
<br>ship, the "Thor Leader," was detained in a port north of Buenos
<br>Aires on February 11 (it arrived at the port February 4) based on
<br>allegations that it had delivered equipment related to the oil
<br>exploration activity to Port Stanley prior to stopping in
<br>Argentina. (Initial reports quoted GoA sources accusing Argentine
<br>oil tubing manufacturer Techint of shipping its goods to the
<br>Islands on board the Thor Leader. The company quickly denied those
<br>claims, stating that the goods to be loaded on the ship were
<br>destined for various customers in the Mediterranean. The
<br>accusations against Techint have not been repeated in the past few
<br>days, but the ship remains detained.) Local press cited the
<br>Financial Times as the source for the information that the ship was
<br>owned by Desire Petroleum, and attributed the drop in Desire's
<br>stock price to the detention. However, other press reports state
<br>that the justification for the detention was a resolution issued in
<br>2007 (see Ref B) which threatens to shut down the Argentine
<br>operations of any oil company that operates in the Falklands
<br>without GoA permission.

<br>Off Falklands
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) British diplomats in Argentina are concerned about how far
<br>the GoA will take this matter, and are therefore seeking to
<br>downplay the situation as much as possible. British Ambassador
<br>Shan Morgan told DCM February 16 that the British strategy is to be
<br>quiet and patient in the hope that the situation blows over, but
<br>adding that London was "jumpy" over the issue. A British Embassy
<br>source quoted by multiple dailies has followed that tack, stating
<br>that "Argentina applies its own laws in its own territory,"
<br>suggesting that this regulation was strictly a domestic Argentine
<br>issue. (Several newspapers said that the quote was in response to
<br>a question about the British-flagged Thor Leader, suggesting that
<br>the UK is not making the detention a bilateral issue.) However,
<br>the source is quoted as adding that "The U.K. has no doubt over its
<br>sovereignty in the Falklands and its maritime waters, and is
<br>convinced that the petroleum exploration is a completely legitimate
<br>activity." Morgan noted her belief that the Kirchners were fanning
<br>the flames in an effort to score political points domestically, a
<br>point underscored in the Argentine press as well.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) British DCM Simon Thomas told EconCouns on February 11 that
<br>the GoA had, as widely reported in the press, formally delivered to
<br>him (as ChargC) d'Affaires) on February 2 a protest over
<br>hydrocarbons exploration activity in the Falklands/Malvinas Islands
<br>territorial waters that was expected to begin in mid-to-late
<br>February. He downplayed the protest, calling it similar to many
<br>their mission has received previously. Thomas was surprised to
<br>learn that the USG had not yet received any similar protest,
<br>despite the fact that the drilling rig contracted by Desire
<br>Petroleum to do the drilling in the Falklands/Malvinas is owned and
<br>operated by a major U.S. drilling firm, Diamond Offshore Drilling.
<br>(British Ambassador Morgan also raised this point with DCM, saying
<br>she has been told by London that U.S. companies had been warned by
<br>the GoA to not participate in the project. She asked us to confirm
<br>that the USG is not/not aware of such approaches, either to U.S.
<br>
<br>
<br>companies or to the USG itself.)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) British diplomats also told EconCouns that several companies
<br>involved in the planned exploration had received warning letters
<br>from the GoA threatening to cancel (or prevent) their operations in
<br>Argentina if they participate in the Falklands/Malvinas exploration
<br>without GoA permission. In addition to Desire Petroleum, these
<br>include Danish shipping giant Maersk, which is towing the rig to
<br>the planned drilling site. The British believe that the intent of
<br>the letters is to pressure companies into dropping all
<br>Falklands-related activity; they did not rule out GoA sanctions
<br>against these companies for continuing Falkland-related activities,
<br>even if such action would also damage the Argentine economy.
<br>Maersk, in particular, handles approximately 20% of Argentina's
<br>foreign shipping, including an estimated 50% of Argentina's soy
<br>exports, the country's top export commodity and a critically
<br>important source of export tax revenues for the GoA.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) There have also been press reports claiming that
<br>British-owned Barclay's Bank, the lead bank working on behalf of
<br>the GoA on the proposed debt restructuring agreement to resolve the
<br>problem of the "holdouts" from the earlier 2005 debt swap (Ref A),
<br>is the single largest shareholder in Desire, with about 4.5% of the
<br>shares. Barclay's is also said to own an interest in Minera
<br>Alumbrera, a large copper and gold mining firm, which was
<br>Argentina's 10th-largest exporter in 2009. Post has not yet been
<br>able to verify either claim. In light of Barclay's ownership
<br>position in Desire, a former Argentine congressman has filed a
<br>lawsuit seeking to force the GoA to end Barclay's participation in
<br>the debt restructuring. Australian company BHP Billiton was also
<br>identified in the press as a firm with interests in both the
<br>Falklands/Malvinas exploration and mining in Argentina.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) While the GoA seeks to prevent companies from participating
<br>in oil exploration activity in the waters off of the
<br>Falklands/Malvinas, it is not clear how much it is willing to risk
<br>real harm to the Argentine economy as it exploits a nationalistic
<br>issue for political gain. For now, the GoA is being scrupulous to
<br>couch its actions in terms of adherence to UN resolutions and
<br>international law. In the absence of an (unlikely)
<br>British-Argentine accord on the Islands, the GoA will, in all
<br>probability, continue to ratchet up economic pressure on Falkland
<br>Islands residents, for whom tourism is an important cash generator.
<br>An aggressive position on the issue unites Argentines behind their
<br>unpopular government, and there is still a long way to go before
<br>the steps contemplated by the GoA cause any real damage to the
<br>Argentine economy. Current ship traffic between Argentina and the
<br>Falklands (as well as the other islands) is limited, and the impact
<br>of the decree on U.S. and other companies will likely also be
<br>limited for now. However, this could change if the GoA ups the
<br>ante and imposes significant sanctions on companies such as tour
<br>cruise ship operators with current activities in both the Falklands
<br>and Argentina, harming both the companies and the Argentine
<br>economy.
