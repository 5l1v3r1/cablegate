<br>SUBJECT: PERSONAL PROTECTION REQUEST FOR SPANISH
<br>ANTI-TERRORISM JUDGE D. BALTASAR GARZON REAL
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) RSO has received a letter from the Spanish Ministry
<br>of Interior, Secretary of State for Security, requesting that
<br>the Diplomatic Security Service provide protective security
<br>services for Spanish Anti-Terrorism Judge Baltasar Garzon.
<br>Judge Garzon will be a long-term guest lecturer at New York
<br>University's King Juan Carlos Center for nine months from
<br>February 28, 2005 until December 01, 2005. His classes will
<br>deal with terrorism and national security issues.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Judge Garzon is considered a critical threat
<br>profile Judge due to his on-going oversight and involvement
<br>in highly-visible terrorism cases including the September 11,
<br>2001 Trade Tower bombings as connected to the Moroccan
<br>Al-Qaida cell known as the Barakat Yarkas group.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) In the letter received, the Spanish Secretary of
<br>State for Security highlights what they consider to be the
<br>risks and considerations that come with the public exposure
<br>of Judge Garzon's work in New York City and requests a
<br>permanent security presence for him. The GOS is committed to
<br>provide two armed Spanish Police to Judge Garzon full time
<br>but believe that a U.S. law enforcement presence is essential
<br>for coordination and effectiveness.
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) In discussions on February 11 with the Spanish
<br>Police Chief for Protective Service, Angel Quintana, the RSO
<br>explained that due to extreme demand on DSS manpower, it was
<br>unlikely that 2 DSS Agents could be provided full time, and
<br>that it was also unlikely that even a single agent could be
<br>dedicated for nine months to this detail. The RSO opined
<br>that the more likely scenario would be an accessible agent
<br>for coordination, communication and problem solving out of DP
<br>or PL.
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Due to the limited planning time (February 28
<br>departure), RSO requests urgent consideration be given to
<br>this request with a rapid response to the RSO for the Spanish
<br>Protective Police travel and visa requirement planning,
<br>keeping the Spanish Embassy in Washington and the Spanish
<br>Consulate in New York in the loop.
