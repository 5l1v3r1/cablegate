<br>Reasons 1.4 (b/d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  On the margins of Shanghai Cooperation 
<br>Organization high-level meetings October 15, PRC Premier Wen 
<br>Jiabao urged Iranian First Vice President Mohammad Reza 
<br>Rahimi to move forward with direct talks with the United 
<br>States and offered PRC support to do so, according to an MFA 
<br>official.  Wen reportedly reiterated that Iran had the right 
<br>to peaceful nuclear technology, but stressed China's 
<br>opposition to Iranian development of nuclear weapons.  Our 
<br>MFA contact claimed that China recognizes the importance of 
<br>seizing the present opportunity and that the Iranian side did 
<br>as well.  The PRC assesses that Iran's willingness to 
<br>negotiate over the nuclear issue comes from Supreme Leader 
<br>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, not President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, 
<br>but the Iranian regime remains divided over the June election 
<br>and its aftermath.  Our contact urged the U.S. to downplay 
<br>sanctions and seek positive, even if symbolic, benefits to 
<br>provide Iran in response to progress in the talks.  China has 
<br>been pushing Iran to improve its cooperation with the IAEA 
<br>and assesses that Iran will make good on its offer to allow 
<br>inspectors into the Qom nuclear site.  Beijing believes that 
<br>Iran's nuclear technology is not as advanced "as some 
<br>believe."  Iranian Embassy officials in Beijing expressed 
<br>satisfaction to the Chinese with the outcomes of the October 
<br>1 P5-plus-1-plus-Iran meeting and were particularly positive 
<br>on the bilateral meeting with the U.S. side, according to the 
<br>MFA.  Our contact argued that a constituency within Iranian 
<br>society that advocates flexibility on the nuclear issue is a 
<br>force in politics, but that the government will need any 
<br>negotiations to accrue benefits to Iran given the strength of 
<br>the conservative camp.  END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>Wen Pushes Iranian Vice President on Nuclear Issue 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) MFA West Asian Affairs Department Iran Division Deputy 
<br>Director Ni Ruchi told PolOff October 21 that Premier Wen 
<br>Jiabao's October 15 meeting with Iranian First Vice President 
<br>Mohammad Reza Rahimi had been brief due to the press of other 
<br>issues at the SCO Summit.  Ni said that the Chinese side had 
<br>raised the nuclear issue and urged Iran to cooperate with the 
<br>international community.  Wen had pushed the Iranians to move 
<br>forward with direct talks with the United States and offered 
<br>Chinese support to do so.  Wen had stressed that while Iran 
<br>had a right to the peaceful use of nuclear technology, China 
<br>opposed Iran's development of nuclear weapons.  Ni claimed 
<br>that Rahimi had responded positively on prospects for talks 
<br>with the United States and said that the Iranians were 
<br>considering how best to do move forward with dialogue. 
<br> 
<br>Beijing Wants to Seize the Moment, as Does Tehran 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Ni emphasized the importance for China of the October 
<br>1 bilateral talks between the U.S. and Iran in Geneva.  He 
<br>noted that China had a very positive outlook for improved 
<br>U.S. relations with Iran, a development that would be helpful 
<br>for progress on the nuclear issue.  China recognized the 
<br>importance of seizing the present opportunity, Ni said, given 
<br>the poor long-term prospects for Iran to improve relations 
<br>with the international community should progress fail to 
<br>materialize in the near future.  He said that the Iranian 
<br>side also understood the uniqueness of this opportunity and 
<br>the importance of demonstrating progress.  He said that 
<br>Beijing assessed that Iran was willing to make a deal with 
<br>the U.S. on the nuclear issue, adding that this willingness 
<br>came from the Supreme Leader, and that President Ahmadinejad 
<br>was not the decision-maker on the issue.  Ni cautioned, 
<br>however, that the Iranian regime remained divided over the 
<br>June election and its aftermath, complicating efforts by the 
<br>P5-plus-1 to negotiate with the regime. 
<br> 
<br>Trust-Building a Priority for PRC 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Ni stressed the need at present to find ways to 
<br>increase Iran's trust in the intentions of the P5-plus-1.  He 
<br>urged the United States to de-emphasize the push for 
<br>additional sanctions and to seek positive, even if symbolic, 
<br>benefits to give Iran in response to progress in the talks. 
<br>He expressed concern that increased pressure from the 
<br>international community would strengthen the consensus of 
<br>hard-liners in the Iranian regime.  Ni reported that Iranian 
<br>diplomats had claimed that while they had a high degree of 
<br>confidence in President Obama's intentions, they remained 
<br>suspicious about his ability to deliver on those intentions 
<br>given political realities in the United States.  He argued 
<br>that China's political efforts to persuade Iran to negotiate 
<br> 
<br>BEIJING 00002932  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>in good faith represented an important contribution to the 
<br>P5-plus-1 effort to deal with the nuclear issue. 
<br> 
<br>PRC Urges IAEA Cooperation, Downplays Technical Progress 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Ni said that China had been pushing Iran to improve 
<br>its cooperation with the IAEA and take a positive attitude in 
<br>order to allow the agency to develop trust in Iran's 
<br>intentions.  Beijing understood that technical meetings at 
<br>the IAEA this week had achieved progress, Ni said, adding 
<br>that China hoped to see progress on the Tehran Research 
<br>Reactor fuel proposal.  China assessed that Iran would allow 
<br>inspectors into the Qom site, Ni said.  He stressed, too, 
<br>that Iran's nuclear technology was not as advanced "as some 
<br>believe," and that Iran's overall level of industrial 
<br>development represented a serious impediment to development 
<br>of nuclear technology and particularly to weaponization.  He 
<br>noted that of the 5,000 centrifuges in Iran, less than half 
<br>were actually in operation. 
<br> 
<br>Iranian Side Upbeat on October 1 Meeting 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Ni said Iranian embassy contacts in Beijing had 
<br>expressed satisfaction with the outcomes of the October 
<br>meeting in Geneva, calling the event a "success." Though 
<br>concerned that sitting down with the U.S. would be "a 
<br>mistake," the Iranians had left the U.S.-Iran bilateral 
<br>meeting wanting to continue the process.  Ni suggested that 
<br>some within the Iranian regime understood the need for a 
<br>change in political direction, particularly after the 
<br>difficult June election.  He also reported that the Iranians 
<br>were putting renewed focus on creating an effective plan for 
<br>economic development. 
<br> 
<br>MFA: U.S. Should Incentivize, Reward Iranian Progress 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) On direct U.S.-Iran talks, Ni urged the U.S. side to 
<br>make a clear statement abandoning the notion of regime 
<br>change.  He suggested seeking a "cooperative partnership" 
<br>with Iran on shared concerns such as security in Iraq and 
<br>Afghanistan, and in doing so, recognizing Iran as a major 
<br>regional power.  He recommended offering concrete and 
<br>immediate benefits, especially economic incentives and a 
<br>relaxation of existing sanctions, in response to positive 
<br>overtures by the Iranian side.  These efforts could start 
<br>small, he added, but should be focused on sending a clear 
<br>signal of sincere intentions to Tehran. 
<br> 
<br>Iranian Leadership Feels Street Pressure on Negotiations 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Ni reported that based on his travel to Iran, 
<br>considerable debate was taking place among ordinary Iranians 
<br>over the utility of the nuclear program.  Many Iranians did 
<br>not see the use in having nuclear technology and saw it only 
<br>as a source of problems, while others saw value in the 
<br>possession of nuclear technology but were reconsidering this 
<br>view because of progress in talks with the United States.  In 
<br>contrast, a more conservative constituency in Iran was 
<br>disinclined to make any concessions to the international 
<br>community on the nuclear issue.  In light of this division in 
<br>society, Ni argued, the Iranian leadership would not make 
<br>concessions without meaningful and visible compensation.
