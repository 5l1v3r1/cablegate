<br>SUBJECT: xxxxxxxxxxxx ON IRANIAN THREATS 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador James C. Oberwetter for reasons 1.5 (b) and (
<br>d).
<br>
<br>(S/NF) Summary: xxxxxxxxxxxx told Assistant to the President for Homeland
<br>Security and Counterterrorism Frances Fragos Townsend that he
<br>was speaking for the King when he urged action to counter
<br>Iranian threats. xxxxxxxxxxxx said he worries more about an
<br>Iranian missile launch against Saudi oil facilities than a
<br>terrorist attack against them, because he can take
<br>preventative measures against terrorism but not against
<br>Iranian missiles. On the Iranian banking initiative, xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>urged getting action from the UAEG to freeze what he claimed
<br>was up to $12 billion in Iranian assets in Dubai-based banks.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx also discussed the failure to establish a charities
<br>commission, and the need to replace the head of Saudi's
<br>financial intelligence unit, as well as the King's personal
<br>security measures. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Iranian Bank Assets and Transactions
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) In an early hour meeting at his palace in Riyadh
<br>November 15, xxxxxxxxxxxx began by asking APHSCT Townsend if
<br>there were any follow-up items from her meetings the prior
<br>day with Prince xxxxxxxxxxxx or Prince xxxxxxxxxxxx.
<br>Townsend noted that xxxxxxxxxxxx had a list of banking institutions
<br>doing business with Iran. We need to use leverage with them,
<br>she added, to get them to do what UBS and Credit Suisse have
<br>done. xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed. He suggested we need to have an
<br>approach, either openly declare the policy as governments or
<br>perhaps get some of the banks to announce a new policy
<br>towards Iran by themselves.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) xxxxxxxxxxxx saw Dubai as the problem for this new
<br>initiative. He said Dubai has 8-12 banks with extensive
<br>links with Iran, holding up to $12 billion in Iranian assets.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx indicated he had met with MBR and MBZ and that MBZ
<br>was supportive of our efforts. We need to send someone
<br>quickly to the UAE to freeze these assets before the Iranians
<br>begin to unload them. In addition, he continued, the Saudi
<br>Monetary Authority should issue a caution to Saudi banks to
<br>refrain from Iranian transactions or else jeopardize their
<br>international dealings.
<br>
<br>Terrorist and Iranian Missile Threats to Saudi Energy
<br>Facilities
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Townsend next raised recent threat information
<br>about Saudi energy facilities. xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that the
<br>Security Facilities Service aims to reach 35,000 personnel,
<br>with all military services contributing to it. xxxxxxxxxxxx said
<br>he was relatively confident in the SAG's ability to handle
<br>terrorist threats to the energy facilities by deploying more
<br>forces and building perimeters. The more dangerous threat,
<br>in his view, is a SCUD missile launch from Iran, which could
<br>happen with short or no notice. The Iranians would target
<br>Saudi facilities at Ras Tanura and Jubail, also perhaps the
<br>US bases in Qatar and Bahrain, which would cause the Saudis
<br>to be involved as well, he said. His concern was that
<br>tightening sanctions on Iran will cause Iran to up the ante,
<br>triggering an escalation leading to a missile launch. Given
<br>the possibility of this scenario, he speculated on the option
<br>of a pre-emptive strike. "I would rather be on the offensive
<br>since we are the target," he said, later adding that he meant
<br>a state of military readiness, not offensive action. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>stressed that this sense of urgency came from King Abdallah,
<br>he was not freelancing. He added that he, Prince xxxxxxxxxxxx and
<br>Prince xxxxxxxxxxxx were getting together an "Iran
<br>to-do list."
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) On the Europeans' positions, xxxxxxxxxxxx asserted that
<br>French President Chirac wants to be satisfied we've done
<br>everything possible politically. However he is not prepared
<br>to accept Iran as a nuclear nation. Russia got an earful
<br>from King Abdalllah, he claimed, on relations with Iran and
<br>Syria.
<br>
<br>Counterterrorism Cooperation
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) xxxxxxxxxxxx sees an "alliance of convenience" between
<br>Iran and al-Qaida. He and Prince xxxxxxxxxxxx agree that Iran
<br>would try two terrorist tracks against Saudi Arabia: al-Qaida
<br>elements and the "mini-Hizballah" in the Eastern Province.
<br>Asked by Townsend on how other GCC countries are cooperating
<br>on CT, xxxxxxxxxxxx said he is very satisfied with UAE, not
<br>unsatisfied with Bahrain, but not comfortable with Kuwait's
<br>
<br>Riyadh 00009095 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>position. Townsend, who had met with the Amir of Kuwait on
<br>November 14, agreed the Amir is focused only on what happens
<br>in Kuwait, xxxxxxxxxxxx said there was a disagreement in Kuwait on
<br>CT measures. xxxxxxxxxxxx said his main channel there is the
<br>foreign minister who has a steady hand and who is not
<br>comfortable with what he sees. Oman, xxxxxxxxxxxx continued,
<br>thinks it's safe because it is too far away. xxxxxxxxxxxx said he
<br>hoped the December 9/10 GCC Summit would include a clear
<br>statement on counterterrorism cooperation.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Townsend raised the status of the commission to
<br>monitor and regulate Saudi charities, saying that since this
<br>commission was announced publicly long ago and not yet
<br>established, it is now a credibility issue. xxxxxxxxxxxx agreed,
<br>noting that the Government was going slowly because of fears
<br>of being attacked by the religious people, But he said it was
<br>time to bring it to the King and get a decision. "Since we
<br>often get accused of being autocratic, we might as well be
<br>autocratic once in a while." He added that if pious Saudis
<br>wanted to help the poor, there were plenty of poor Saudis
<br>they could help and thus no need to fund outside charities.
<br>When Townsend raised the importance of the Joint Terrorist
<br>Finance Task Force, xxxxxxxxxxxx replied that he wants to resolve
<br>this so they could get items like this off the agenda and
<br>focus on the real strategic threat -- Iran. Townsend said
<br>she would be thrilled if she didn't have to raise it again on
<br>her next visit.
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) On counterterror financing issues, xxxxxxxxxxxx said
<br>Muhammad bin Nayef was unhappy with the head of the Saudi
<br>Financial Intelligence Unit xxxxxxxxxxxx, and
<br>would replace him. Bandar claimed that Muhammad bin Nayef
<br>reports having frozen 189 bank accounts, with nearly $20
<br>million in frozen assets. xxxxxxxxxxxx asserted that the SAG
<br>shared our interest fully in going after terrorist financing,
<br>but that we need to do it intelligently so as not to create
<br>economic martyrs for the religious extremists.
<br>
<br>The King's Personal Security
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Townsend raised recent measures to provide new
<br>equipment, which xxxxxxxxxxxx thanked her for. He added that he
<br>was trying to convince the King to buy 3 or 4 helicopters,
<br>including a medical helicopter, Lockheed Martin models,
<br>similar to those used by POTUS. But the King says he cares
<br>first about the security of the country, and less about his
<br>personal security. If the King doesn't use them, xxxxxxxxxxxx said
<br>they would find another use for them.
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) APSCT Townsend has cleared this cable.
