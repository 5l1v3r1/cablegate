<br>Classified By: Ambassador James D. McGee for reason 1.4 (d) 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX, poloff met with XXXXXXXXXXXX, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX region that contains the 
<br>diamond-rich Marange fields, to discuss violence in the 
<br>region as well as recent developments in the turbulent 
<br>Marange diamond trade. XXXXXXXXXXXX described how the military 
<br>expansion in XXXXXXXXXXXX in late November has been displacing 
<br>the police and diverting the diamond flow from the Reserve 
<br>Bank of Zimbabwe to the Zimbabwean military. This has not 
<br>deterred the continued brisk diamond trade involving foreign 
<br>buyers, including most prominently the Lebanese. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>Shootings Continue as Bodies Pile Up 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The tribal chief XXXXXXXXXXXX, met 
<br>with poloff in Harare XXXXXXXXXXXX and confirmed that 
<br>military and police shootings in Marange are continuing, as 
<br>security forces tighten their control over the diamond-rich 
<br>area. This was seconded by a report we received from a human 
<br>rights group in the region (REF A). According to the report, 
<br>during police and military Operation Hakudzokwi, (Shona for 
<br>"you won't come back") which was aimed at clearing individual 
<br>panners from the area, over 200 bodies turned up at Mutare 
<br>Provincial Hospital Mortuary, Old Mutare Mission Hospital, 
<br>Sakubva District Hospital, and private mortuaries. Many of 
<br>those bodies arrived with fatal gunshot or dog bite wounds 
<br>and were tagged "BID Marange" or "brought in dead from 
<br>Marange." 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX many of his people have been 
<br>killed, beaten, and arrested for dealing in diamonds. The 
<br>villagers had entrusted their diamond findings to XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>because he owned a safe and they thought his tribal status 
<br>would be respected; however, the police forced him to turn 
<br>over the village's diamond stash to the security forces. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX is now in hiding in Harare. He also told us
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX he had been harassed, arrested, and beaten beat out . XXXXXXXXXXXX END NOTE.) 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>Military Expansion Displacing the Police 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX confirmed that the military has increased 
<br>its numbers in the region and now exceeds the police presence 
<br>by a large margin. He suspected the increase stemmed from 
<br>concern that the power-sharing negotiations between ZANU-PF 
<br>and the MDC might culminate in the awarding of the Home 
<br>
<br>HARARE 00000024 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Affairs ministry--which includes the police department--to 
<br>the MDC. This would result in a tremendous loss of wealth 
<br>and patronage that helps to maintain the Mugabe regime. 
<br>Therefore, he believed that the military, which would remain 
<br>under ZANU-PF control in the event of an agreement between 
<br>the two parties, was seeking to consolidate its authority. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Digging by panners, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX, is 
<br>continuing in Marange largely under the supervision of the 
<br>military. The typical practice is for soldiers to supervise 
<br>and escort groups of panners as they dig. Then at the end of 
<br>the day, any diamonds found are apportioned between soldiers 
<br>and diggers. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that military helicopters fly in 
<br>daily and transport many of the diamonds to bases near 
<br>Harare, where presumably they are taken by senior military 
<br>commanders. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>Gono May Have Been Cut Out of the Deal 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Prior to the military expansion in late November, it 
<br>was well known by locals that Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) 
<br>governor Gideon Gono had representatives in Mutare buying 
<br>diamonds with bundles of freshly-printed Zimbabwean notes 
<br>(Ref B). XXXXXXXXXXXX claimed that the military has now barred 
<br>Gono's operatives from the region and that diamonds are no 
<br>longer being sent to the RBZ. All diamond purchases are now 
<br>being conducted solely in foreign exchange. (NOTE: According 
<br>to an article in the state-controlled newspaper, the Herald, 
<br>Tendai Makurumidzi, a well-known Gono buyer who uses the 
<br>alias "Gonyeti" was arrested sometime in November and had 
<br>three of his vehicles seized. END NOTE.) XXXXXXXXXXXX explained 
<br>that it used to be common to see 4x4 vehicles leaving 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, but now the roads have deteriorated to the point 
<br>that access is only possible by foot or helicopter. 
<br>Vehicular access to the greater area is also being controlled 
<br>by police and military roadblocks, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>Foreign Buying Unabated 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) While Gono's access to diamonds may have been 
<br>compromised, XXXXXXXXXXXX said that many diamonds are still being 
<br>sold to foreign diamond buyers in Mutare and over the border 
<br>in Mozambique by a mix of panners, police, and soldiers. In 
<br>particular, Lebanese buyers have set up shop in large numbers 
<br>in Mutare and typically pay for the diamonds with U.S. 
<br>dollars. In order to operate safely, the Lebanese have 
<br>formed profitable relationships with senior military and 
<br>police officials in the region. Marginally more reputable 
<br>buyers from Europe and other regions prefer to stay in 
<br>Chimoio in Mozambique. Chimoio affords these buyers 
<br>protection from Zimbabwean police and soldiers who commonly 
<br>seize cash, diamonds, and vehicles from them in Mutare, but 
<br>that safety is offset by higher diamond prices. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) We previously reported on a meeting between Gono and 
<br>the Russian diamond monopoly ALROSA (Ref C) in November. 
<br>Recent press reports, corroborated by Embassy sources, 
<br>
<br>HARARE 00000024 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>indicate that Mugabe is planning a trip to Russia in January 
<br>to discuss mining investment opportunities. With the GOZ 
<br>desperate for forex, such a trip could involve discussion of 
<br>a Chiadzwa diamond deal between Zimbabwe and Russia. END 
<br>COMMENT.
