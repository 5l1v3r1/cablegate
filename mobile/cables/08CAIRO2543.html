<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR GENERAL PETRAEUS' VISIT TO EGYPT 
<br>
<br>REF: A. CAIRO 2175 
<br>¶B. CAIRO 2141 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey per 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary and Introduction: General Petraeus, 
<br>welcome to Egypt. Your visit will be, I hope, the first in a 
<br>regular process of dialogue and consultation with Egyptian 
<br>leaders who view the U.S.-Egyptian security partnership as 
<br>the cornerstone of the bilateral relationship. This visit 
<br>provides an opportunity for you to assess the state of our 
<br>military partnership and to identify new opportunities. To 
<br>date, the U.S. investment in the Egyptian Armed Forces (over 
<br>$36 billion since 1980) through the Foreign Military 
<br>Financing (FMF) program has supported peace between Egypt and 
<br>Israel and assured Egyptian support for extending peace to 
<br>the rest of the Arab world. In addition, the Egyptian 
<br>military has the potential to become interoperable with U.S. 
<br>forces * capable of fighting side by side as they did in the 
<br>1991 First Gulf War - and continues to provide critical Suez 
<br>Canal and overflight access for U.S. military operations and 
<br>to provide peacekeepers to regional and international 
<br>conflict zones. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) The United States has sought to interest the 
<br>Egyptian military into expanding their mission in ways that 
<br>reflect new regional and transnational security threats, such 
<br>as piracy, border security, and counterterrorism. Egypt,s 
<br>aging leadership, however, has resisted our efforts and 
<br>remains satisfied with continuing to do what they have done 
<br>for years: train for force-on-force warfare with a premium 
<br>on ground forces and armor. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) We have requested meetings with President Mubarak, 
<br>Defense Minister Field Marshal Tantawi, EGIS Chief General 
<br>Soliman, and Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit. The overall 
<br>U.S.-Egyptian relationship has suffered in the past few 
<br>years. The Egyptians have lost confidence in U.S. regional 
<br>leadership. They believe that the U.S. invasion of Iraq was 
<br>an unmitigated disaster that has unleashed Iranian regional 
<br>ambitions and that the U.S. waited far too long to engage in 
<br>Arab-Israeli peacemaking efforts. In addition, U.S. and 
<br>Egyptian differences over the pace and direction of political 
<br>reform have drained the warmth from the relationship on both 
<br>sides. We believe President Mubarak would be interested in 
<br>an early visit to Washington to consult with President Obama, 
<br>in large part to try to begin repairing the relationship. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>Mil-Mil Cooperation: In Need of Renovation 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Mubarak and military leaders view the FMF program 
<br>as the cornerstone of our security relationship and believe 
<br>the $1.3 billion annual grant should be viewed as 
<br>"untouchable compensation" for making peace with Israel. They 
<br>complain that the parity between U.S. assistance to Israel 
<br>and to Egypt has been destroyed as U.S. security assistance 
<br>to Israel has climbed and theirs has remained fixed. We have 
<br>come to take the U.S.-Egyptian security partnership for 
<br>granted, but we should not underestimate its value to us and 
<br>the region. Our partnership guarantees there can be no 
<br>resumption of overt Arab-Israeli war and also provides 
<br>valuable US military access to the Suez Canal and Egyptian 
<br>airspace. We would not like to contemplate complications for 
<br>U.S. regional interests should the U.S.-Egyptian bond be 
<br>seriously weakened. Nevertheless, we recognize the 
<br>backward-looking nature of Egypt,s military posture and 
<br>believe that finding new, mutually agreed objectives could 
<br>assure the continuation of our strategic ties with Egypt into 
<br>the future. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Seventy-seven year old Field Marshall Tantawi, in 
<br>office since 1991, has resisted any change to usage of FMF 
<br>funding and has been the chief impediment to transforming the 
<br>military,s mission to meet emerging security threats. 
<br>During his tenure, the tactical and operational readiness of 
<br>the Egyptian Armed Forces (EAF) has decayed. But he retains 
<br>Mubarak's support, and could easily remain in place for years 
<br>to come. Tantawi will likely express his opposition to 
<br>Congress conditioning military and economic assistance and 
<br>will seek support in convincing Congress of Egypt's strategic 
<br>importance. He will also make a case for the release of 
<br>certain military systems such as the TOW IIB and F-15 
<br>fighter aircraft. 
<br>
<br>CAIRO 00002543 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) You should assure Mubarak and Tantawi that Egypt 
<br>remains a key U.S. ally, but that we would like to find new 
<br>areas of cooperation that build on existing relationships but 
<br>that look to meeting new threats. Such a development would 
<br>help us defend the Egyptian FMF program by demonstrating its 
<br>ongoing value. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Threats to this partnership exist. Although all 
<br>previous Administrations and Congresses since Camp David have 
<br>reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to a strategic U.S.-Egyptian 
<br>relationship, the events of the last few years have made a 
<br>few cracks in the foundations. Congressional concern about 
<br>Egypt,s poor human rights and democracy record prompted the 
<br>imposition in 2008 of conditions upon Egypt,s assistance 
<br>program. Although the Secretary of State was given the right 
<br>to waive the conditionality, the Egyptians view 
<br>conditionality as "unacceptable." We are currently dealing 
<br>with the conditionality issue for FY2009. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) The potential for Congressional action that could 
<br>affect Egyptian FMF/ESF funding, creates even greater reason 
<br>for Egypt to begin to orient more of its military 
<br>capabilities toward unconventional threats. The more 
<br>Egyptian military cooperation can be viewed as backstopping 
<br>U.S. military requirements in the region, the easier it is to 
<br>defend the Egyptian assistance program on the Hill. Over the 
<br>last year, we have engaged MOD leaders on developing shared 
<br>objectives to address current threats, including border 
<br>security, counter terrorism, civil defense, and 
<br>peace-keeping. Our efforts thus far have met with limited 
<br>success. After initially strong resistance, MOD supported 
<br>the first phase of a $23 million FMF-funded counter-smuggling 
<br>system soon to be installed on the Gaza-Egyptian border (ref 
<br>A). You should encourage Tantawi to immediately approve the 
<br>follow-on stages and stress the importance of using the 
<br>knowledge gained from the seismic-acoustic equipment to 
<br>destroy tunnels and break up arms smuggling rings. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) One way to demonstrate Egypt's continued strategic 
<br>importance is through shifting more FMF funding to address 
<br>asymmetric threats like terrorism and improving border 
<br>security along its long and porous borders. You should also 
<br>stress with GOE interlocutors that our mil-mil relationship 
<br>is much greater than the yearly flow of military assistance. 
<br>Egypt could play a much more active 
<br>and influential role in regional security issues, including 
<br>supporting and training the Iraqi military, deploying more 
<br>peace keeping troops to Sudan, joining neighbors in combating 
<br>piracy, and stemming the flow of illegal migration. Another 
<br>such concrete display of a more forward looking security 
<br>strategy would be to support CENTCOM's efforts to re-invent 
<br>BRIGHT STAR. Tantawi will lament the loss of large-scale 
<br>BRIGHT STAR. You should stress that BRIGHT STAR continues to 
<br>be an important strategic 
<br>statement for the U.S. and its regional allies, and solicit 
<br>his input for ways to make BRIGHT STAR more relevant. 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>Regional Efforts 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) While the military remains inwardly focused, 
<br>Mubarak and key Egyptian officials remain engaged on a number 
<br>of regional issues. On Iraq, although President Mubarak 
<br>remains deeply suspicious that Nuri Al Maliki answers to 
<br>Tehran, other GOE officials have expressed increasing 
<br>confidence that Iraq has turned a corner and may avoid civil 
<br>war. Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit recently completed a 
<br>successful trip to Baghdad in October (ref B) and is moving 
<br>forward to reopen the Embassy in Baghdad. On the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian conflict, GOE efforts to facilitate 
<br>intra-Palestinian reconciliation under the auspices of EGIS 
<br>Chief General Soliman foundered in November due, in their 
<br>view, to Iranian-Syrian meddling. On Iran, Egypt is concerned 
<br>by rising Iranian influence in the region and has supported 
<br>UN sanctions, but does not have a comprehensive strategy to 
<br>counter Iran's regional momentum. The 
<br>Egyptians have worked with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states 
<br>to support Lebanese political and territorial sovereignty. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Egypt is a steadfast ally in the GWOT, and we 
<br>maintain close cooperation on a broad range of 
<br>counter-terrorism and law enforcement issues. We have a 
<br>long-standing and productive relationship with EGIS and SSIS, 
<br>the two Egyptian agencies that cover internal and regional 
<br>
<br>CAIRO 00002543 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>terrorism issues. Through the Department of State's 
<br>Anti-Terrorism Assistance program, we are working with SSIS 
<br>to establish an anti-terror investigative unit, and also are 
<br>in the beginning stages of a USG-funded community policing 
<br>program that will include needed human rights training. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>Internal Politics and Economics 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Our fundamental political reform goal in Egypt 
<br>remains democratic transformation, including the expansion of 
<br>political freedom and pluralism, respect for human rights, 
<br>and a stable and legitimate transition to the post-Mubarak 
<br>era. Egyptian democracy and human rights efforts, however, 
<br>are being suffocated, and Mubarak remains skeptical of our 
<br>role in democracy promotion, lecturing us that any efforts to 
<br>open up will result in empowering the Muslim Brotherhood 
<br>(which currently holds 86 seats in Egypt's parliament). 
<br>Mubarak now makes scant public pretense of advancing a vision 
<br>for democratic change. An ongoing challenge remains balancing 
<br>our security interests with our democracy promotion efforts. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (S/NF) Mubarak, who is now 80, is in solid health, 
<br>notwithstanding a hearing deficit in his left ear. The next 
<br>presidential elections are scheduled for 2011, and if Mubarak 
<br>is still alive it is likely he will run again, and, 
<br>inevitably, win. Despite incessant whispered discussions, no 
<br>one in Egypt has any certainty about who will eventually 
<br>succeed Mubarak, nor how the succession will happen. Mubarak 
<br>himself seems to be trusting to God and the inertia of the 
<br>military and civilian security services to ensure an orderly 
<br>transition. The most likely contenders for next president 
<br>are presidential son Gamal Mubarak (whose profile is 
<br>ever-increasing at the ruling party), EGIS chief Omar 
<br>Soliman, dark horse Arab League Secretary-General Amre 
<br>Moussa, another old-guard regime insider, or an as-yet 
<br>unknown military officer. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Economic reform has been a success story, although 
<br>Egypt still suffers from widespread and so far irremediable 
<br>poverty affecting upwards of 35-40% of the population. 
<br>Reforms in trade and tax policy, financial reform, 
<br>privatization and increased transparency have led to 7% 
<br>economic growth in the last fiscal year. Foreign investment 
<br>increased from around $3 billion in 2005 to $11 
<br>billion in the last year, mostly in the petroleum sector. 
<br>Despite this success, significant problems remain, including 
<br>20% inflation, high levels of poverty and unemployment, and 
<br>endemic corruption. The effects of the global financial 
<br>crisis on Egypt may not be as severe as elsewhere, as 
<br>Egyptian banks operate very conservatively and have been 
<br>spared involvement in risky financial products. The informal 
<br>economy also provides a certain degree of resiliency to the 
<br>economic picture. Nevertheless, as the economic crisis 
<br>worsens, Egypt remains vulnerable as exports, Suez canal 
<br>revenues, tourism, and remittances will reflect global 
<br>trends. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (S/NF) U.S. economic assistance will drop from $415 
<br>million in FY 2008 to $200 million annually for the next five 
<br>years starting in FY 2009. The Egyptians are not pleased 
<br>with the cut and have suggested several ways of using the 
<br>assistance that would be difficult to get through Congress, 
<br>such as debt relief. We would like to focus assistance on 
<br>health care and education reform along with poverty 
<br>alleviation. Negotiations are ongoing over use of future 
<br>assistance funds.
