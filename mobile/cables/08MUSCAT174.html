<br>SUBJECT: ADMIRAL WILLIAM J. FALLON'S MEETING WITH SULTAN 
<br>QABOOS 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Gary A. Grappo for Reasons 1.4 (b, d) 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Sultan Qaboos discussed both domestic and regional 
<br>issues during his February 19 meeting with Admiral William J. 
<br>Fallon, CENTCOM Commander.  On the domestic front, the Sultan 
<br>described his desire to empower the government to be more 
<br>responsive to citizen concerns.  Seeking to strengthen the 
<br>role of Omani women, the Sultan plans to convene a conference 
<br>in 2009 designed to increase the participation and leadership 
<br>of women in all aspects of Omani society.  Sultan Qaboos also 
<br>shared plans for continued infrastructure development in Oman 
<br>and described efforts underway to obtain more natural gas. 
<br>On Iraq, the Sultan advised against a premature withdrawal of 
<br>U.S. forces and stated that more regional assistance would be 
<br>forthcoming if Iraqis would "come together" to take charge 
<br>of, and invest in, their own country.  Sultan Qaboos shared 
<br>U.S. concerns about Iranian meddling in Iraq and elsewhere, 
<br>but contended that Tehran knew confrontation with the U.S. 
<br>was not in its interest.  Iran's "charm offensive" in the GCC 
<br>had succeeded in lessening suspicions of some officials about 
<br>the true intentions of Iranian policies.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (C) CENTCOM Commander Admiral Fallon, accompanied by the 
<br>Ambassador, met February 19 with Sultan Qaboos bin Sa'id for 
<br>approximately 2 hours at one of the Sultan's castles -- Husn 
<br>al Shumugh -- in the interior of Oman.  (Note:  The Sultan 
<br>was outside of Muscat on his annual 4-6 week "meet the people 
<br>tour" during which he visits selected sites outside the 
<br>capital.  End Note.)  The Sultan appeared in good health and 
<br>was cheerful, although he commented that his role as ruler of 
<br>Oman was demanding and did not allow him time to do all the 
<br>things he wanted to do, such as reading more books.  "My 
<br>office is wherever I am," he stated, noting that he 
<br>constantly had to attend to paperwork and urgent requests 
<br>from his staff, among other tasks.  The Sultan added that 
<br>despite his busy schedule, he always made time to "watch the 
<br>news," though he did not elaborate on his preferred media 
<br>outlet. 
<br> 
<br>------------------- 
<br>CONCERNS ABOUT IRAQ 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C) The Sultan expressed concern over a premature 
<br>withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq.  Recognizing recent 
<br>improvements in the security situation, he counseled that 
<br>American troops should only leave "when the time is right." 
<br>He stressed that Iraqis had to "take charge" of the fate of 
<br>their country, but questioned whether the different factions 
<br>would be able to "come together" to accomplish this.  He 
<br>pointedly asked the Admiral, "Do you really think Prime 
<br>Minister Maliki and his government are capable of pulling the 
<br>country together?"  The Sultan did not directly respond to 
<br>Admiral Fallon's comment on the need for assistance and 
<br>investment for Iraq from elsewhere in the region.  Instead, 
<br>he stated that if the Iraqi people helped themselves and 
<br>invested in their own country, others would follow suit. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) The Sultan appeared to follow events in Iraq closely. 
<br> He commented, for example, that the Kurds had apparently 
<br>"come out well" in recent central government talks on budget 
<br>issues, and asked about the status of electricity production 
<br>in Iraq.  The Sultan seemed to take a particular interest in 
<br>Admiral Fallon's discussion of Iraqi Shia leader Abdul Aziz 
<br>al-Hakim, including the status of Hakim's health and his 
<br>possible successors. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) In addition to emphasizing the need for outside 
<br>investment in Iraq, Admiral Fallon highlighted the importance 
<br>of assistance from regional states for infrastructure 
<br>development in Afghanistan and other Central Asian nations. 
<br>Again the Sultan sidestepped the issue and shifted the 
<br>conversation to the critical role of roads and highways in 
<br>economic development.  He then mentioned infrastructure 
<br>projects for Oman currently under consideration, including 
<br>construction of a new dam and a freight rail line from the 
<br>northern port of Sohar to the planned port in Duqm.  The 
<br>Sultan hoped that the southern port of Salalah could be 
<br>linked by rail to Muscat and, eventually, to other GCC 
<br>states.

<br> 
<br> 
<br>-------------- 
<br>IRANIAN ISSUES 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) The Sultan commented that the Iranians are "not 
<br>fools," and claimed that Tehran realized there are "certain 
<br>lines it cannot cross" (i.e., direct confrontation with the 
<br>U.S.).  Regarding GCC relations with the Iranian government, 
<br>he stated, "Iran is a big country with muscles and we must 
<br>deal with it."  He continued that Iran's "charm offensive" in 
<br>the region had achieved a degree of success as some GCC 
<br>authorities (he did not mention names) were now less 
<br>suspicious of Iranian intentions.  The Sultan added, 
<br>laughing, that "I must say that as long as (the U.S.) is on 
<br>the horizon, we have nothing to fear." 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) Responding to Admiral Fallon's frustration with 
<br>Iranian interference in Iraq, the Sultan remarked that 
<br>Iranian meddling abroad was "almost a game" to the regime in 
<br>Tehran, and said that Iran's leaders would have to stop this 
<br>practice if Iran wanted to "join the world as a noble 
<br>country."  The Sultan hoped that Iraqi leaders would clearly 
<br>tell and convince Iranian President Ahmadinejad during his 
<br>upcoming visit to Iraq to cease Iran's unhelpful interference 
<br>in their internal affairs.  On the possibility that Iran is 
<br>waiting out the President's final term before re-assessing 
<br>its strategy, the Sultan said that Tehran should realize that 
<br>it has to deal with the U.S. as a country, and not just the 
<br>current administration. 
<br> 
<br>------------------ 
<br>THE SEARCH FOR GAS 
<br>------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) After noting Iranian dependence on imports of refined 
<br>fuel, the Sultan described Oman's efforts to obtain more 
<br>natural gas to fuel growing domestic power needs and 
<br>large-scale industrial projects.  Oman had committed too much 
<br>of its limited gas production to long-term liquefied natural 
<br>gas (LNG) export contracts.  As a result, the government was 
<br>trying to boost production by taking smaller and less 
<br>productive gas fields away from Petroleum Development Oman 
<br>(PDO) -- 60% owned by the government and 34% owned by Royal 
<br>Dutch Shell -- and awarding them to outside companies such as 
<br>British Gas and BP.  The Sultan claimed these firms were in a 
<br>better position to increase productivity in these fields, and 
<br>pointed to the progress of U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum 
<br>Company in raising oil production in former PDO concession 
<br>areas, such as Mukhaizna. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Looking offshore, the Sultan said he hoped that new 
<br>gas fields would be found in the Gulf of Oman to help ease 
<br>the country's natural gas shortage.  India's Reliance 
<br>Industries was currently exploring a deepwater oil and gas 
<br>block in this body of water, but had made no significant 
<br>discoveries yet.  Qatar would begin supplying gas to Oman by 
<br>2013, the Sultan noted, but not in quantities sufficient to 
<br>meet outstanding needs.  He added that Oman was still 
<br>supplying limited gas from Musandam to Ras al-Khaimah in the 
<br>UAE due to an agreement he made with its emir -- and which 
<br>the Sultan felt he could not break -- well before Oman was 
<br>squeezed for this resource. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) Sultan Qaboos shared that he placed a great deal of 
<br>importance on education, and noted that a study of history 
<br>provided the context needed to better understand present 
<br>trends and events.  Regarding claims that some rulers in the 
<br>region wanted to keep their people uneducated in order to 
<br>more easily control them, the Sultan explained that this 
<br>strategy could easily backfire as it also left the populace 
<br>more susceptible to influence by extremists, such as the 
<br>Muslim Brotherhood.  Former Egyptian president and 
<br>pan-Arabist leader Gamal Abdal Nasser, the Sultan said, had 
<br>"set the region back" by being "anti-everything" and engaging 
<br>in vitriolic rhetoric designed to keep the masses ignorant. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>EMPOWERING THE GOVERNMENT AND WOMEN 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (C) On domestic politics, the Sultan announced that he 
<br>would hold the first-ever combined meeting of his Cabinet of 
<br>Ministers and the Majlis al-Shura (the directly elected lower 
<br> 
<br>MUSCAT 00000174  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>house of Oman's bicameral advisory body) on February 26.  By 
<br>meeting together, the Sultan hoped that the Cabinet and the 
<br>Majlis would learn how to cooperate better and jointly focus 
<br>on important issues.  He commented that both bodies also 
<br>needed to "demonstrate more leadership" and avoid past 
<br>foot-dragging on promises made to the populace.  "People need 
<br>to see the results of decisions," the Sultan stated. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) Letting Admiral Fallon and the Ambassador in on a 
<br>"secret," the Sultan confided that he planned to call for a 
<br>conference of all "notable women" in Oman in 2009 in a bid to 
<br>encourage Omani women to expand their participation and 
<br>leadership in different aspects of Omani society.  Minister 
<br>of Social Development, Dr. Sharifa bint Khalfan al-Yahyaiya 
<br>(one of Oman's three female cabinet ministers) will chair the 
<br>meeting on the Sultan's behalf.  Lamenting that no women won 
<br>seats in the October 2007 election for the Majlis al-Shura, 
<br>Sultan Qaboos observed that Omani women were stuck in 
<br>tradition and needed to be empowered to "take more charge" 
<br>and to be "less shy."  "Some customs (regarding women)," he 
<br>added, "shouldn't be kept."  Nevertheless, gradual change is 
<br>occurring in Oman, the Sultan asserted.  His philosophy was 
<br>to "let it happen," rather than hold it up to public debate, 
<br>as the latter course of action often led to factional 
<br>fighting, internal strife, and other ills. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>A RECURRENT THEME: MORE RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) In concluding the meeting, Sultan Qaboos returned to 
<br>his goal of improving the responsiveness of the Omani 
<br>government to citizen concerns.  He stated that he would be 
<br>pressing "harder" on his ministers to engage in more and 
<br>better public relations efforts before the Omani police and 
<br>to effectively enforce their decisions so that the people 
<br>could see the benefits of announced actions.  Giving one 
<br>particular example, the Sultan said that rather than simply 
<br>announce a new development project, the government should 
<br>explain the downstream employment opportunities the project 
<br>would generate for Omani citizens.  Effective cooperation 
<br>between ministries and the Majlis Oman was also needed to 
<br>strengthen the civil institutional framework in Oman, the 
<br>Sultan added. 
<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶14.  (S/NF) In discussing his desire for operational change 
<br>in the senior government ranks, the Sultan twice implied (but 
<br>did not directly state) that such change was needed to 
<br>prepare the country for his eventual departure from power. 
<br>The Sultan's comments indicated that he may feel the 
<br>government is too dependent on his authority and should be 
<br>empowered to run more effectively without constant direction 
<br>from the palace.  End Comment. 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (U) This message has been reviewed by Admiral Fallon.
