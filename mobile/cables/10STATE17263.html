<br>(U) Summary
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) A U.S. interagency team -- lead by ISN Acting
<br>Assistant Secretary Vann H. Van Diepen -- met with a Russian
<br>interagency team lead by Vladimir Nazarov, Deputy Secretary
<br>of the Russian National Security Council (full participants
<br>list is provided in paragraphs 76-77 below), on December 22,
<br>2009 for a second round of discussions on a Joint Threat
<br>Assessment (JTA), as agreed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev
<br>in the 2009 U.S.-Russia Summit Joint Statement on Missile
<br>Defense Issues.  The Russian delegation came prepared to
<br>engage seriously, and made  presentations on their evaluation
<br>of the missile programs of Iran and the DPRK; a conceptual
<br>framework for evaluating the risk posed by various missile
<br>programs; Russian concerns about instability in Pakistan and
<br>the security of nuclear weapons and missiles there; and the
<br>work of the FSB (Federal Security Service) in countering
<br>efforts by Iranian and North Korean agencies to either obtain
<br>nuclear and missile technologies and materials in Russia or
<br>to transship the
<br>m through Russian territory.  While the Russians were
<br>prepared for discussions of cooperation at a strategic level
<br>on countering missile proliferation, their position remained
<br>the same: in their analysis, the missile programs of Iran and
<br>the DPRK are not sufficiently developed, and their intentions
<br>to use missiles against the U.S. or Russia are nonexistent,
<br>thus not constituting a "threat" requiring the deployment of
<br>missile defenses.  The discussions included a vigorous
<br>exchange of questions and answers, and concluded with an
<br>invitation by the Russians to hold the next round of the JTA
<br>in Moscow in March or April 2010.  The discussions lasted the
<br>full day.  End Summary. 
<br>
<br>-------------------
<br>(U) Opening remarks
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Van Diepen recalled that the July 2009 U.S.-Russia
<br>Joint Statement called for U.S. and Russian experts to work
<br>together to analyze ballistic missile threats and that the
<br>U.S. side had provided analyses of Iran's and North Korea's
<br>missile programs at the September JTA.  He said that the U.S.
<br>side looked forward to receiving Russian perspectives on
<br>these programs and discussing areas of agreement and
<br>disagreement.  He added that the U.S. hoped that development
<br>of a more shared perspective on these issues would help
<br>inform how the U.S. and Russia address missile threats
<br>bilaterally and multilaterally.  Consistent with the Joint
<br>Statement and the non-paper U/S Tauscher provided to Russia
<br>in November, this effort also could help the U.S. and Russia
<br>assess how to defend against missile threats if that becomes
<br>necessary.  Van Diepen ended by underscoring that the U.S.
<br>looked forward to detailed discussions and then deciding on
<br>potential next steps. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Nazarov thanked Van Diepen for reminding both sides of
<br>the context for the work of the JTA.  He noted that the July
<br>6 Joint Statement said that experts of both countries would
<br>analyze threats of the 21st century and make recommendations
<br>for political and diplomatic means to address them.  Russia
<br>takes this seriously, and President Medvedev has given the
<br>highest priority to this work and has instructed that this
<br>work be coordinated under the Security Council of the Russian
<br>Federation.  Accordingly, Nazarov said, the Russian
<br>delegation includes representatives from all of the Russian
<br>agencies responsible for tracking missile threats and
<br>countering them.   He added that the Russian side planned to
<br>make presentations, focusing primarily on Iran and North
<br>Korea.  After that, the Russian delegation would be prepared
<br>to comment on the presentations made by the U.S. at the last
<br>JTA meeting in July.   He said the Russian delegation had
<br>studied these materials closely and had several comments and
<br>questions. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Nazarov concluded by noting that Russia looked forward
<br>to a creative dialogue and robust exchange of opinions
<br>between the experts of both sides.  He said Russia would
<br>focus primarily  on the threats from Iran and North Korea,
<br>noting that Russia believed the long-term strategic interests
<br>of the U.S. and Russia largely coincide and that the
<br>acquisition of nuclear and/or missile capabilities by Iran,
<br>North Korea, or other threshold states is unacceptable.
<br>Nazarov hoped that the discussions would be productive and
<br>potentially lead to the drafting of a joint assessment, and
<br>perhaps to the creation of a joint document. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----
<br>(U) Russian Presentations on Iran and North Korea
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---- 
<br>
<br>Iran: 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Evgeny Zudin of the Russian Ministry of Defense gave
<br>detailed presentations on the Russian assessment of the
<br>Iranian and North Korean missile programs, and the degree to
<br>which Russia believes these programs constitute threats
<br>requiring missile defense responses.  For Russia, the bottom
<br>line is that, in essence, neither program constitutes a
<br>threat at the moment or in the near future. 
<br>
<br>NOTE:  Russia did not provide paper copies of either
<br>presentation to the U.S. delegation.  END NOTE. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) On Iran, Zudin made the following points concerning
<br>Scud missiles: 
<br>
<br>--Given the challenging and complex situation of the regional
<br>context that surrounds Iran, Iran's leaders view acquiring a
<br>missile capability as a deterrent to existent threats.  To
<br>that end, they also consistently exaggerate Iran's
<br>achievements in missile production. 
<br>
<br>--The core of the Iranian missile program has been the
<br>evolutionary development of liquid-fueled missiles based on
<br>Soviet Scud technology from the 1960s. 
<br>
<br>--Tehran acquired Scud B systems from a number of countries
<br>during the 1980s. 
<br>
<br>--The Iranian version, called the Shahab-1, has a range of
<br>300 km and a reentry vehicle of 1 ton. 
<br>
<br>--With scientific and technological assistance from North
<br>Korea, Iran acquired production capabilities for both the
<br>Scud B and the Scud C. 
<br>
<br>--The Scud C, called the Shahab-2 by the Iranians, has a
<br>range of 550 km with a 700 kg payload. 
<br>
<br>--Iran has also developed and commissioned a medium range
<br>ballistic missile (MRBM) called the Shahab-3, based on the
<br>North Korean No Dong-1 and using Scud-based technologies.
<br>The Shahab-3 has a range of 1,500 km and a 700 kg payload. 
<br>
<br>--Iran has done a good deal of work to improve the precision
<br>and range of this system, creating the Shahab-3M, which Iran
<br>claims has a range of 2,000 km, although so far the confirmed
<br>range is only 1,600-1,700 km. 
<br>
<br>--Russia's analysis indicates that this was achieved by
<br>reducing the re-entry vehicle weight to 250 kg and improving
<br>the engine. 
<br>
<br>-- Russia also believes that this very nearly exhausts the
<br>potential for Iran to increase the range of the Shahab-3 or
<br>make further improvements to Scud-based missile technology. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Moving on from Scud-based technology, Zudin made the
<br>following points on Iran's development of a 2,000 km-range
<br>solid propellant system: 
<br>
<br>--Iran has been developing solid propellant MRBMs/IRBMs with
<br>better operational capability since 2000. 
<br>
<br>--Currently, Russia is seeing the development of a two-stage
<br>intermediate (2,000 km) solid propellant missile. 
<br>
<br>--The first test of this system in November 2007 failed.
<br>During the second test on November 12, 2008, Iran
<br>successfully accomplished the uplift stage of the missile. 
<br>
<br>--Following the third test of the missile in May 2009, Iran
<br>announced that the launch was successful and that it would
<br>begin serial production of this missile. 
<br>
<br>--This system was tested again on December 16, 2009, and Iran
<br>also claimed this test was successful. 
<br>
<br>--The Russian assessment is that regardless of optimistic
<br>statements from Iran, the test of this missile was actually
<br>just a test of a successful prototype and that what the test
<br>did was allow Iran to practice first stage operation and
<br>stage separation. 
<br>
<br>--Russia believes Iran will need another 2-3 years of testing
<br>to perfect the missile.  Russia believes it will not actually
<br>be deployed for 5-6 years. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Zudin said that another potential success indicator
<br>for Iran's missile program is the Safir space launch vehicle
<br>(SLV) program.  He said the Safir launch on February 2, 2009
<br>was successful in putting the Omid  (26 kg) satellite into
<br>orbit.  However, Iran's first attempt to launch the satellite
<br>into orbit on August 17, 2008 was unsuccessful.  Russia
<br>assesses that in order to achieve the successful launch, Iran
<br>had used
<br>the maximum potential of its liquid-propellant technology
<br>(the first stage of the Safir was a Shahab-3).  As for Iran
<br>developing combat/offensive long-range missiles based on SLV
<br>technology, Russia believes, in theory, this is possible.
<br>However, from a military technological perspective, Russia
<br>believes this is unviable due to low throw weight of the
<br>system.  In addition, Russia believes that development of a
<br>long-range missile based on its SLV efforts would require
<br>Iran to intensify its research and development, conduct a
<br>series of test launches outside its territory, and increase
<br>throw weight and accuracy.  Thus, in Russia's view, despite
<br>Iran's successful launch of a satellite, it is premature to
<br>talk about Iran successfully developing the technology for a
<br>militarily useful long-range ballistic missile capacity. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Zudin summed up his presentation on Iran by noting
<br>that over the last four years, Iran has successfully launched
<br>a 26 kg satellite into orbit and conducted several successful
<br>launches of a solid propellant MRBM, according to unconfirmed
<br>information.  However, Russia believes Iran's "success" boils
<br>down to creating Shahab-3-class liquid propellant missiles
<br>with an accuracy of several kilometers that can reach targets
<br>in the Middle East and Southeastern Europe, but given
<br>conventional warheads, these missiles cannot do substantial
<br>damage.  Under favorable conditions, Russia believes Iran
<br>might be able to begin a program to develop ballistic
<br>missiles with ranges of between 3,000-5,000 km after 2015,
<br>but Russia does not see Iran taking any steps in this
<br>direction.  Rather, Russia has concluded that Iran's
<br>ballistic missile program continues to be directed toward
<br>developing combat ready missiles to address regional concerns. 
<br>
<br>North Korea: 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Zudin made the following points with regard to the
<br>DPRK's missile program: 
<br>
<br>--Over the last two decades North Korea has paid increased
<br>attention to developing and producing ballistic missiles and
<br>SLVs. 
<br>
<br>--The DPRK has commissioned the production of liquid
<br>propellant missiles such as Scud Bs and Cs (which North Korea
<br>calls the Hwasong 5 and 6), the No Dong I, the short-range
<br>KN-02, and the "Luna-M" tactical missile, plus solid
<br>propellant battlefield and tactical rockets. 
<br>
<br>--The core of North Korea's missile capability is missile
<br>technology from the 1960s. 
<br>
<br>--The potentially outdated No Dong-1, with a range of
<br>1,000-1,300 km and a reentry vehicle of one ton, is the most
<br>advanced missile commissioned by the North Korean military. 
<br>
<br>--In Russia's assessment, only the KN-02, with a range of
<br>less than 100 km, is relatively modern. 
<br>
<br>--Since early in the 1990s, North Korea has slowly developed
<br>missiles of the Taepo Dong class. 
<br>
<br>--Russia estimates that the Taepo Dong-1 (TD-1) was a
<br>prototype two-stage liquid propellant missile with a
<br>2,000-2,500 km range. 
<br>
<br>--The TD-I first stage used a No Dong-1 engine, and the
<br>second stage used a Scud engine. 
<br>
<br>--The only flight test of the TD-I was conducted on August
<br>31, 1998, during which the DPRK practiced separation of
<br>missile stages.  North Korea declared this test to be an SLV
<br>launch. 
<br>
<br>--The Taepo Dong-2 (TD-2) MRBM is a two-stage liquid
<br>propellant missile with a range of 3,500-6,000 km, depending
<br>on the weight of the warhead. 
<br>
<br>--A July 5, 2006 test launch of the TD-II failed as the
<br>missile exploded 40 seconds into flight. 
<br>
<br>--Russia estimates that North Korea tested elements of the
<br>Taepo Dong-2 with its April 5, 2009 SLV launch. 
<br>
<br>--Russia believes North Korea has demonstrated a certain
<br>level of progress in the missile area by creating a first
<br>stage engine with a thrust of 100 tons. 
<br>
<br>--North Korea conducted tests of nuclear devices on October
<br>9, 2006 and May 26, 2009.  However, it remains unproven
<br>whether North Korea can make a nuclear warhead of the size
<br>and weight that would allow it to be carried by a ballistic
<br>missile. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) Zudin said that in Russia's view, the widespread
<br>claims about North Korea's achievements in the missile area
<br>are dubious.  In particular, Russia notes that it is claimed
<br>that North Korea has a new missile based on the Soviet R-27
<br>(NOTE: SS-N-6.  END NOTE) submarine-launched ballistic
<br>missile (SLBM) that is capable of reaching ranges of
<br>2,400-4,000 km.  However, the many published reports
<br>regarding this missile, which is known as the BM-25, contain
<br>claims that are made without reference to any reliable
<br>sources.  Moreover, Zudin said, the fact is that there have
<br>been no successful tests of this missile in either North
<br>Korea or Iran.  Russia also is unaware that this missile has
<br>ever been seen.  There are claims that 19 of these missiles
<br>were shipped to Iran in 2005, but there is no evidence for
<br>this and concealment of such a transfer would be impossible. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) Zudin said Russia believes the real missile potential
<br>of North Korea is an impressive arsenal of outdated missiles
<br>with ranges no greater than 1,300 km and that are only a
<br>threat to countries in the region that North Korea considers
<br>to be enemies.  Russia estimates that in the years to come
<br>North Korea will devote considerable effort to improving and
<br>perfecting its SLV.  To this end, it will use the launch
<br>facility near the community of Tongchang-Dong (NOTE: Known to
<br>the U.S. as the Yunsong facility.  END NOTE).  Russia
<br>assesses that North Korean development of long-range
<br>ballistic missiles based on SLVs is possible in principle,
<br>but perfection will take years.  The prospects for North
<br>Korea developing a combat operational system from such a
<br>process is not likely due to the inability to conduct
<br>concealed preparations for launch and the long preparation
<br>times. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) Summing up, Zudin said Iran's and North Korea's
<br>missile programs can be characterized as follows:  the only
<br>real successes are liquid propellant intermediate range
<br>missiles with ranges of 1,300 km, and both countries would
<br>face real technical difficulties in trying to make additional
<br>advances to increase the range of their systems. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>(U) Discussion on Iranian and North Korean Missiles
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) Van Diepen thanked the Russian delegation for its
<br>presentations, noting that there appeared to be some areas
<br>where both sides agree, other areas where the two sides see
<br>the same thing a little differently, and areas where the two
<br>sides disagree.  He said it is good to have the opportunity
<br>to examine the differences and the reasons for them, and
<br>urged that this be done in a structured way.  Van Diepen
<br>proposed discussion begin with Iran and North Korea
<br>generally, and then move to specific categories of
<br>short-range, medium range, and long-range missiles.  On Iran,
<br>he said it appeared that both sides had similar assessments
<br>at the technical level with regard to short range missiles in
<br>Iran. On medium range missiles in Iran, both sides agree
<br>there is the original No Dong, a modified No Dong with longer
<br>range - although the U.S. and Russia have different ideas of
<br>the modifications made to achieve that longer range.  And
<br>both sides seem to agree that Iran is developing a two-stage
<br>solid propellant missile.
<br> Beyond that, U.S. and Russian assessments seem to diverge. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (S) Based on the Russian presentations, the U.S.
<br>delegation posed a number of questions.  The Russian
<br>delegation also raised a number of questions about U.S.
<br>comments and the U.S. presentations on Iran and North Korea
<br>from the September JTA talks.  The topics raised and
<br>follow-up discussions were as follows: 
<br>
<br>¶16. (S) Shahab-3 Reentry Vehicle Mass 
<br>
<br>The U.S. noted that based on modeling, it assesses that the
<br>modified Shahab-3 has 600 kg re-entry vehicle mass at a range
<br>of 2,000 km, and asked for Russia to explain the basis for
<br>its assessment of 250 kg re-entry vehicle mass. The U.S. also
<br>asked how useful such a missile would be as a military
<br>weapon.  Russia responded that there is some uncertainty in
<br>its estimate, conceding that the 250 kg is at the low end of
<br>Russia's estimate.  However, Russia believes that the low
<br>weight of the Shahab-3 warhead makes it pointless as a
<br>military weapon.  Although the range could be further
<br>increased with a lighter warhead, Russia's view is that such
<br>a missile also is pointless.  Additionally, while Russia
<br>views the U.S. 600 kg estimate as being close to the 700 kg
<br>weight of the basic Shahab-3 warhead, it assesses that the
<br>range of the system with that warhead is 1,300 km, not 2,000
<br>km.  Russia does not believe that if the weight of the
<br>warhead is decreased by just 50 kg, it is realistic to assess
<br>that the Shahab 3 would
<br> achieve a 2,000 km range. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (S) Aluminum Airframe 
<br>
<br>The U.S. said that its assessment of a 2,000 km range for the
<br>Shahab-3 is achieved through the use of an aluminum airframe
<br>instead of steel and increased engine thrust.  Russia asked
<br>whether the assessment that the Shahab 3 airframe is made
<br>with aluminum rather than steel is based on speculation or
<br>fact.  The U.S. responded that the assessment derives from
<br>information relating to Iran seeking various aluminum alloys.
<br> Additionally, during the Information Exchange (IE) portion
<br>of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Plenary, a
<br>number of presentations, including by the UK and France, also
<br>assessed that the Shahab-3 has an aluminum airframe and
<br>described a number of Iranian attempts to procure aluminum
<br>for this purpose.  For this reason there also have been MTCR
<br>proposals to add the types of aluminum sought by Iran to the
<br>MTCR Annex. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (S) Safir Airframes 
<br>
<br>The U.S. noted that it appears that the first stage of the
<br>Safir SLV is the Shahab-3, and asked whether Russia believes
<br>the Safir could achieve orbit with a steel airframe.  Russia
<br>answered that the facts are that the Safir was used to put a
<br>satellite with a very low mass into orbit.  It is likely that
<br>the technologies used to achieve this were exploited to their
<br>utmost.  Russian analysis showed that the size of the Omid is
<br>the limit of what Iran could put into orbit.  The U.S. agreed
<br> that a very low weight satellite was all that the Safir
<br>could put into orbit, but assessed that even orbiting such a
<br>small satellite could only be done using an aluminum
<br>airframe.  In U.S. modeling of the launch using a steel
<br>airframe, the Safir was not able to get close to putting
<br>anything into orbit. 
<br>
<br>¶19. (S) Russia remarked that even if the U.S. and Russia
<br>disagree over the materials used in the airframe, both sides
<br>can agree that the capability of this missile was used to its
<br>maximum to get a satellite into orbit.  If there is agreement
<br>on this point, then both sides should be able to agree that
<br>using this system as a weapon is pointless.  The U.S.
<br>responded that this was not necessarily so and would depend
<br>on how the rocket   is used.  The Safir launch might have
<br>been a technology demonstrator.  If one clustered or stacked
<br>the Shahab, it could be used as a longer-range system.  The
<br>U.S. added that something using a single Shahab as its first
<br>stage will have limitations, but that is not the only option. 
<br>
<br>¶20. (S) Using Clustered Engines 
<br>
<br>Russia noted that during the JTA talks in Moscow, the U.S.
<br>discussed several options Iran would have with regard to a
<br>cluster scheme.  However, in Russia's view, the problem with
<br>a cluster scheme is that it makes the missile nonviable for
<br>military purposes.  The U.S. responded that a cluster scheme
<br>would make the system less mobile, but noted that it would
<br>provide a possibility for putting a missile further
<br>downrange.  However, the basic U.S. point is that the Safir
<br>could have been a technology demonstrator for staging,
<br>separation, ignition, and control of an upper stage.  Russia
<br>noted that it views the Safir launch as a success and has
<br>stated this.  Additionally, Russia agrees there are ways to
<br>increase the throw weight, including the clustering of
<br>engines, but the goal of the Russian review of Iran's missile
<br>capabilities was to examine whether the Iranian program could
<br>create a combat ready missile that meets certain
<br>specifications.  In Russia's view it cannot, and talking
<br>about the Shahab-3 as a long-range
<br> combat missile is unrealistic. 
<br>
<br>¶21. (S) The U.S. agreed it is not realistic for a mobile
<br>missile, but thought it would be realistic for use in a silo
<br>or underground.  Russia responded that such a missile would
<br>require a fixed launch pad.  Fifty years ago fixed launch
<br>pads deep inside a country were survivable, but now that is
<br>not realistic.  The U.S. countered that both Russia and the
<br>U.S. still have hundreds of such launch sites.  Russia said
<br>that was a topic for another discussion, not JTA. 
<br>
<br>¶22. (S) Iran Not Capable of Producing Longer-Range Missiles 
<br>
<br>Russia said its bottom line is that Iran lacks appropriate
<br>structural materials for long-range systems, such as high
<br>quality aluminum.  Iran can build prototypes, but in order to
<br>be a threat to the U.S. or Russia Iran needs to produce
<br>missiles in mass quantities, and it lacks materials
<br>sufficient for the type of mass production needed to be a
<br>security threat.  Russia further noted that the technology
<br>for longer-range missiles is sophisticated and difficult to
<br>master.  For example, the elongated airframes Iran is using
<br>might not survive the stresses of a ballistic flight path,
<br>and the guidance system for the missile (Shahab-3) is
<br>outdated and does not allow for precision steering.
<br>According to Russian calculations, if the control system is
<br>used at a range of 2,000 km, it could veer as much as 6-7 km
<br>off its target; at 5,000 km, the accuracy could be off by
<br>50-60 km.  In addition, the liquid propellants used by the
<br>Iranians are of low efficiency.  Iran is working to improve
<br>the power of the engine and develop
<br>more efficient kinds of fuel.  However, it faces significant
<br>challenges.  Iran also has problems with launch preparation
<br>times, although it has made some recent improvements. 
<br>
<br>¶23. (S) Launching from Silos 
<br>
<br>Russia said it does not think a Shahab-3 derived system could
<br>be launched from a silo.  Ground launch sites that are for
<br>SLVs are not suitable for military launches, and missiles
<br>with side-based vent engines and clustered engines cannot be
<br>silo-based.  The U.S. responded that this might be an area
<br>where U.S. and Russian assessments differ.  For example, the
<br>U.S. thinks the Taepo Dong-2 is a clustered missile that can
<br>be launched from a silo or underground launcher, adding that
<br>there are scenarios to compensate for shortcomings of this
<br>technology should the Iranians or North Koreans choose to
<br>pursue them. 
<br>
<br>¶24. (S) Iranian Solid Propellant MRBM 
<br>
<br>The U.S. said it does not see the solid-propellant MRBM as a
<br>technology demonstrator.  This system has been tested four
<br>times in the past two years, and the U.S. assesses Iran will
<br>be ready to field it in less than the 5-6 year timeframe
<br>Russia envisions.  Russia asked how soon the U.S. thought the
<br>system could be ready.  The U.S. said that it would not be
<br>surprised if a two-stage system with a range up to 2,000 km
<br>were fielded
<br>within a year, at least in limited numbers.  The U.S. also
<br>noted that not all countries follow the same testing
<br>procedures as the U.S. and Russia.  North Korea is an extreme
<br>example, but Iran does not have the same test philosophy as
<br>either the U.S. or Russia. 
<br>
<br>¶25. (S) The Path to Long Range Missile Development in Iran 
<br>
<br>The U.S. said the main potential avenue for Iran developing
<br>long range missiles is by using current systems as building
<br>blocks.  For example, using the Shahab-3 with clustered or
<br>stacked engines could be one path.  Another path might be the
<br>so-called BM-25 missile that the U.S. believes was sold to
<br>Iran by North Korea.  A third path might be development of a
<br>solid-propellant MRBM with more powerful motors.  Russia said
<br>that its views on the Shahab 3 had already been discussed.
<br>Russia had some questions about the other two paths the U.S.
<br>had identified.  In addition, Russia thinks it also will be
<br>very important to consider the intentions of Iran and North
<br>Korea that could lead to creation or improvement of its
<br>missiles.  This will affect what each side (U.S. and Russia)
<br>does to monitor what these countries (Iran and North Korea)
<br>do to acquire missile technologies, including procurement
<br>methods.  It also will help define the key technologies
<br>required by these countries now and in the future and in
<br>finding a means for protecting these technologies. 
<br>
<br>¶26. (S) The BM-25 
<br>
<br>Russia said that during its presentations in Moscow and its
<br>comments thus far during the current talks, the U.S. has
<br>discussed the BM-25 as an existing system.  Russia questioned
<br>the basis for this assumption and asked for any facts the
<br>U.S. had to provide its existence such as launches, photos,
<br>etc.  For Russia, the BM-25 is a mysterious missile.  North
<br>Korea has not conducted any tests of this missile, but the
<br>U.S. has said that North Korea transferred 19 of these
<br>missiles to Iran.  It is hard for Russia to follow the logic
<br>trail on this.  Since Russia has not seen any evidence of
<br>this missile being developed or tested, it is hard for Russia
<br>to imagine that Iran would buy an untested system.  Russia
<br>does not understand how a deal would be made for an untested
<br>missile.  References to the missile's existence are more in
<br>the domain of political literature than technical fact.  In
<br>short, for Russia, there is a question about the existence of
<br>this system. 
<br>
<br>¶27. (S) The U.S. repeated its earlier comment that Iran and
<br>North Korea have different standards of missile development
<br>than many other countries, including the U.S. and Russia.
<br>North Korea exported No Dong missiles after only one flight
<br>test, so it is not unimaginable that it would build and seek
<br>to export a system that has not been tested.  This is
<br>especially true for North Korea because of its need for hard
<br>currency.  In the U.S. view, the more interesting question is
<br>why would Iran buy a missile that has not been tested.  One
<br>possible answer is that Iran has recognized that the BM-25's
<br>propulsion technology exceeds the capabilities of that used
<br>in the Shahab-3, and that acquiring such technology was very
<br>attractive.  Iran wanted engines capable of using
<br>more-energetic fuels, and buying a batch of BM-25 missiles
<br>gives Iran a set it can work on for reverse engineering.
<br>This estimate would be consistent with the second stage of
<br>the Safir SLV using steering engines from the BM-25 missile. 
<br>
<br>¶28. (S) Safir and BM-25 
<br>
<br>The U.S. explained that based on a comparison of Internet
<br>photos of the second stage of the Safir, the U.S. assessment
<br>is that the steering (vernier) engines on the Safir are the
<br>same as on the R-27.  The weld lines and tank volumes from
<br>the Safir second stage show that the ratio of oxidizer to
<br>propellant is not consistent with Scud propellants and more
<br>consistent with unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and
<br>nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4), which were used in the R-27.  The
<br>U.S. does not have any information on why Iran has not flight
<br>tested the BM-25.  It may be due to difficulties assembling
<br>the missiles, but it appears that they have at least done
<br>work with the steering (vernier) engines.  Russia asked if
<br>the U.S. was saying that its case for the existence of the
<br>BM-25 missile is that individual elements of the Safir
<br>resemble the steering engines of the R-27 missile. 
<br>
<br>¶29. (S) The U.S. said that is only part of the case.  In the
<br>media, and more importantly in the MTCR Information Exchange,
<br>countries have offered direct evidence of the transfer of the
<br>BM-25 from North Korea to Iran.  Russia asked if the U.S. had
<br>pictures of the missile in Iran.  The U.S. did not, but noted
<br>that North Korea had paraded the missile through the streets
<br>of Pyongyang.  Russia disagreed.  Russia said it had reviewed
<br>the video of the North Korean military parade and concluded
<br>that North Korea had shown a different missile.  Russia does
<br>not think the BM-25 exists.  The missile appears to be a
<br>myth, and some say that it is based on a Russian missile.
<br>However, no one has seen it, and Russia cannot find traces of
<br>it.  The U.S. said it would endeavor to provide further
<br>information on the existence of the BM-25 at the next round
<br>of talks, noting that reaching agreement on this point will
<br>affect the joint assessment of Iranian and North Korean
<br>missile capabilities. 
<br>
<br>¶30. (S) Safir Fuel 
<br>
<br>Russia asked whether the U.S. had any clear images of the
<br>Safir that allow for the assessment of tank volumes and the
<br>ratio of fuel to oxidizer.  The U.S. said that the weld lines
<br>of the second stage are clear in the pictures Iran put on the
<br>Internet, and U.S. analysts were able to make pretty good
<br>calculations based on this information.  Russia questioned
<br>this, saying that the photos did not allow for accurate
<br>measurements of distances.  The U.S. undertook to provide
<br>more information on this point at the next round of talks. 
<br>
<br>¶31. (S) The U.S. then asked Russia for its assessment of the
<br>types of propellant used in the Safir second stage.  Russia
<br>said it thinks that hydrazine is used.  The U.S. asked
<br>whether Russia thought UDMH might be involved.  Russia did
<br>not.  It said that there might be different combinations of
<br>fuel and oxidizers, but the base is hydrazine. 
<br>
<br>¶32. (S) More on Propellants 
<br>
<br>The U.S. asked whether Russia assesses that Iran is moving
<br>beyond Scud propellants.  Russia responded that it believes
<br>Iran is trying to move in this direction because it wants
<br>something more powerful - something that can lift 40-50 tons.
<br> With bigger engines, Iran can improve missile range.  Thus,
<br>Iran has been working to acquire more-energetic fuels and
<br>trying to produce UDMH and N2O4.  However, Iran has been
<br>working on this for approximately 10 years, and Russia has
<br>not seen any serious results.  Russia further noted that
<br>Malik Ashtar University in Tehran has been working on fuel
<br>combinations, but it apparently has not been successful.  The
<br>fact that Iran has not succeeded in this area is evident in
<br>Iran's effort to seek this technology from abroad. 
<br>
<br>¶33. (S) The U.S. noted that it was significant that both the
<br>U.S. and Russia assess that Iran is working on more-energetic
<br>propellants, even if the two sides differ in how far along
<br>they are.  Russia responded that this is due to the fact that
<br>Iran has not yet launched any longer range missiles.  There
<br>have been no tests, and statements from Iran that it has
<br>missiles that can fly 2,000 km have not been substantiated.
<br>The longest range that Russia has seen is 1,700 km, and that
<br>was achieved only because of a reduced throw weight.  If the
<br>U.S. has additional data to share, Russia would be
<br>interested.  The U.S. agreed to look into the matter and
<br>elaborate further at the next JTA talks. 
<br>
<br>¶34. (S) However, the U.S. also noted that modeling shows that
<br>achieving a greater range is possible.  Just because a
<br>capability has not been demonstrated operationally does not
<br>mean that it is not possible.  Once a program has achieved
<br>1,500 km, going a few hundred kilometers more is not that
<br>much of an obstacle.  Going from 1,700 to 2,000 km is not a
<br>great technological stretch.  Russia said it could not agree
<br>because with a longer flight, various parts of the missile
<br>could burn through, the missile could fall apart, or it could
<br>go off course.  It needs to be tested at its maximum range.
<br>As discussed earlier, the U.S. believes Iran can achieve the
<br>increased range due to a combination of increased thrust from
<br>more powerful engines, a slightly reduced payload, and the
<br>use of aluminum instead of steel. 
<br>
<br>¶35. (S) Russia disagreed with the U.S. assessment that Iran
<br>has been able to buy technology to produce solid propellant
<br>engines.  Russia believes Iran continues to work on the
<br>technology to mix and pour the propellant.  This is a very
<br>difficult process.  Solid fuel has to be very evenly mixed to
<br>work properly.  It must be put into the motor case and then
<br>allowed to solidify, and the resulting fuel must be
<br>homogeneous.  In addition, fuel loading is more complicated
<br>for larger engines, and Iran has not mastered this.  Russia
<br>also believes Iran is experimenting with fuel composition,
<br>how long fuels can be preserved, and how temperatures can
<br>affect the mixture.  Russia does not think that Iran has
<br>solved the problem of thermal isolation of the engine from
<br>the airframe, as the junction with the engine tends to burn
<br>through.  Russia also does not think that Iran has solved the
<br>problem of thrust vector control and gas steering
<br>technologies.  The old technologies are not reliable, and
<br>Iran has had a hard time getting
<br> components from abroad.  In addition, Iran cannot produce
<br>high-quality spherical aluminum powder and without this it
<br>cannot reliably produce solid fuel.  Russia noted that even
<br>Israel needs to buy ammonium perchlorate from abroad.  Iran
<br>has been trying to produce it indigenously, but Russia has no
<br>information indicating it has been successful.  In Russia's
<br>view, Iran appears to be having very serious problems with
<br>engine development. 
<br>
<br>¶36. (S) The Ashura 
<br>
<br>Russia said that in June 2008, it had received information
<br>from the State Department that within the framework of the
<br>Ashura program, Iran is producing a 3-stage missile called
<br>the Ghadr-110.  At that time, the U.S. told Russia that this
<br>missile is very similar to the Pakistani Shaheen-II and has a
<br>range of 2,000 km with a throw weight of one ton.  Testing of
<br>the Ghadr-110 may have started in 2008, and Russia would like
<br>additional information on this system.  The U.S. said that
<br>there appeared to be some confusion:  the Ashura is a
<br>two-stage solid propellant missile with a 2,000 km range, and
<br>the Ghadr-110 is the Fateh-110, a single-stage SRBM. 
<br>
<br>¶37. (S) Sejjil 
<br>
<br>Russia asked whether the Sejjil was part of the Ashura
<br>program.  The U.S. said it thinks the Sejjil is another name
<br>for the Ashura.  In addition, Iran also has a short range
<br>solid propellant system called the Fateh-110.  The experience
<br>gained from that program has been used in the development of
<br>the Ashura and helps explain how Iran acquired the capability
<br>to develop larger motors.  In the 1990s, Iran received
<br>production technology and infrastructure from China to
<br>develop solid propellants.  That infrastructure was used in
<br>the Fateh-110 and now is being used as the technological
<br>basis for the Ashura.  While the U.S. would agree that a
<br>larger solid propellant engine is challenging, Iran has over
<br>a decade of experience producing solid propellant motors and
<br>it got an important head start from China.  Independent of
<br>what Iran has since acquired, this head start allowed Iran to
<br>develop the Ashura, which has been flight tested
<br>successfully, and also to work toward longer-range systems.
<br>Russia did not fully agree,
<br>saying that the technology for an SRBM is quite different
<br>from medium and longer range systems. 
<br>
<br>¶38. (S) Iranian Challenges 
<br>
<br>Noting that Russia had mentioned several problems with Iran's
<br>efforts to develop larger motors, the U.S. asked for the
<br>basis of Russia's assessment and specifically whether it
<br>derived from the results of ground testing.  Russia responded
<br>that Iran is having problems generally because it did not
<br>develop the technology in Iran and is trying to work off of
<br>North Korean technology.  The U.S. then asked how Russia
<br>would explain
<br>the Ashura having been flight tested twice successfully.
<br>Russia said there is nothing special there as the technology
<br>is all old technology as described in detail in the
<br>literature of the Chinese Long March 4 engine.  The U.S.
<br>pointed out that the Long March is a liquid propellant
<br>system, and the Ashura is a solid propellant system.  If Iran
<br>has successful tests, it shows Iran has built MRBM rocket
<br>motors.  Russia countered that all it shows is that Iran is
<br>testing parts of the missile.  Iran may have claimed success
<br>but that is not the reality.  If Iran wants it to be
<br>reliable, the missile has to be tested many times before it
<br>can be deployed.  This is what Russia believes.  Russia
<br>understands the U.S. has a different point of view and this
<br>can be discussed again another time. 
<br>
<br>¶39. (S) North Korean Scuds 
<br>
<br>The U.S. said it seemed that both sides had a common
<br>evaluation of what types of short range systems North Korea
<br>possesses:  the Scud B, Scud C, and the new solid propellant
<br>MRBM.  Russia said that in 2008, the U.S. indicated that
<br>North Korean Scuds were launched at longer ranges.  Russia
<br>asked for any specific data on these missile launches and for
<br>U.S. thinking on why these systems are extended range Scuds
<br>and not Scud C missiles.  The U.S. said that it would try to
<br>provide more information on this issue at the next round of
<br>talks.  However, it is known that there have been at least
<br>two cases of North Korea helping other countries to develop
<br>Scuds with longer ranges than the Scud C.    One example is
<br>Libya.  When Libya gave up its MTCR-class missile programs in
<br>2003, it showed the U.S. a missile it called the "Scud-C."
<br>However, it had a longer range than the missile we refer
<br>generally refer to as the Scud-C.  Additionally, many
<br>presentations in the MTCR Information Exchange have reported
<br>that North Korea is helping other countries, particularly
<br>Syria, develop a Scud with a longer range.  These
<br>presentations have referred to this longer range system as
<br>the Scud-D. 
<br>
<br>¶40. (S) No Dong 
<br>
<br>The U.S. thought that both sides had similar assessments of
<br>the No Dong.  Referring to the U.S. presentation from the
<br>previous JTA talks, Russia noted that the U.S. said there
<br>were seven launches of the No Dong in July 2009 by North
<br>Korea.  Russia has no information on such tests, and wondered
<br>if there U.S. had been referring to 2006.  The U.S. said that
<br>there had been tests of the No Dong just after July 4, 2009,
<br>and that there had been plenty of South Korean and Japanese
<br>reporting at that time.  Russia agreed there were July 4
<br>missile launches, but of missiles with shorter ranges, not
<br>Scuds or No Dongs.  Given the confusion on this point, Russia
<br>urged that the issue be revisited during the next round of
<br>talks. 
<br>
<br>¶41. (S) UDMH 
<br>
<br>Russia asked whether the U.S. thinks North Korea is trying to
<br>develop a new engine that uses UDMH.  The U.S. said it
<br>believes this effort is connected with a new system North
<br>Korea is working on.  The U.S. thinks this new system is an
<br>IRBM. 
<br>
<br>¶42. (S) IRBM 
<br>
<br>Russia asked whether the U.S. has any specific data on this
<br>system.  The U.S. said it believes the system exists and has
<br>been sold to Iran as the BM-25. 
<br>
<br>¶43. (S) Taepo Dong 
<br>
<br>The U.S. agreed with Russia that the Taepo Dong-1 was a
<br>technology demonstrator that is no longer being used, and
<br>that the Taepo Dong-2 has had two tests that have been
<br>unsuccessful.  However, there is not agreement on the purpose
<br>of the Taepo Dong-2 system.  In tests, the intent has been
<br>billed as putting a satellite into orbit, but the U.S. also
<br>thinks it is very much intended as part of the development of
<br>an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).  Russia noted
<br>for clarification that North Korea calls the Taepo Dong-2 the
<br>Unha-2. 
<br>
<br>¶44. (S) Russia believes the system has an engine with a 100
<br>ton capacity that uses clustered designs based on old
<br>technology, and asked whether the U.S. thought the Taepo
<br>Dong-2 uses any new technology.  The U.S. responded that it
<br>has not seen any new technology associated with this system.
<br>Nevertheless, one path to acquiring a longer range system
<br>would be to cluster or stack engines for the new IRBM in the
<br>same way North Korea used Scud and No Dong engines in the
<br>Taepo Dong-2.  Russia pointed out that so far this has not
<br>been observed and there is no new technology associated with
<br>an ICBM in North Korea.  The U.S. agreed that no new
<br>technology has been observed in the ICBM, but it has been in
<br>the IRBM. 
<br>
<br>¶45. (S) Russia noted that in its presentations the U.S. had
<br>given a range of 10,000 km - 15,000 km with a 500 kg warhead
<br>for the Taepo Dong and asked how the U.S. had calculated
<br>this.  The U.S. said that for the 10,000 km range, it had
<br>assumed a clustered first stage and a No Dong second stage.
<br>For the 15,000 km range, it assumed a 3-stage configuration
<br>with the same clustered engines and second stage. 
<br>
<br>¶46. (S) Taepo Dong-2 and Military Applications 
<br>
<br>Russia pointed out that the Taepo Dong-2 would be hard to use
<br>for combat due to a lack of sites and its long launch
<br>preparation time.  The U.S. noted that North Korea could
<br>mitigate those problems by placing it in a silo or using it
<br>as a first strike weapon.  These would not be optimal
<br>approaches but if North Korea is sufficiently desperate, it
<br>would go with the systems available to it.  Moreover, North
<br>Korea puts great political value on these systems.  In the
<br>wake of the nuclear test and the UNSCR that followed, North
<br>Korea threatened to conduct an ICBM test.  This is another
<br>manifestation of the political value of this program for
<br>North Korea. 
<br>
<br>¶47. (S) North Korean Path to an ICBM 
<br>
<br>The U.S. said it saw three potential paths for North Korea to
<br>follow to obtain an ICBM: 1) use the Taepo Dong-2 as an ICBM;
<br>2) further develop the technology for an IRBM based on their
<br>new MRBM, in the same way the No Dong was a path to the Taepo
<br>Dong; and 3) use the very large launch facility that is being
<br>constructed on the west coast of North Korea to launch a very
<br>large missile.  Russia said that the first two paths could be
<br>discussed at a later date. 
<br>
<br>¶48. (S) With regard to the third path, Russia wonders whether
<br>North Korea is building the new launch site to avoid
<br>launching over Japan and for safety reasons.  The U.S.
<br>responded that the size of the facility is of concern.  It
<br>does not simply replicate other sites.  This facility is much
<br>larger than the Taepo Dong launch facility.  This is not to
<br>say there is evidence of a new missile system larger than the
<br>Taepo Dong-2 being developed, but it suggests the
<br>possibility.  North Korea does not spend money on things
<br>unless they really matter.  Russia noted that North Korea
<br>does not have so much money, so it must economize.  However,
<br>Russia can probably agree that the new site is being built to
<br>test new missiles.  That said, Russia still thinks North
<br>Korea has problems developing more-powerful engines and
<br>accurate guidance systems.  This merits further observation
<br>and analysis. 
<br>
<br>¶49. (S) General Comments 
<br>
<br>Russia said it sees it as significant that Iran and North
<br>Korea are trying to buy more materials abroad and trying to
<br>get around existing export control regimes.  However, each
<br>country is different and Russia cannot say they are working
<br>according to the same principles.  On clustering, Russia has
<br>a different point of view than the U.S., but will look
<br>further into this.  Russia also has a different view on
<br>silos, but that can be discussed in more detail next time.
<br>In short, North Korea is complex and neither the U.S. nor
<br>Russia fully understands its capabilities.  Both sides need
<br>to monitor this carefully and work together on this issue. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>(U) Russian presentation of a framework for evaluating
<br>missile risks, dangers and threats; and discussion
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>
<br>¶50. (S) Nazarov said Russia believes any missile assessments
<br>should be based not only on modeling, but also on
<br>consideration of the real technical barriers faced by Iran.
<br>Serious attention must be given to these technical problems.
<br>Otherwise, we will use erroneous assumptions to evaluate the
<br>problem.  For example, we can count the number of
<br>centrifuges, multiply by production capabilities, and say
<br>Iran can produce enough uranium for several warheads.
<br>However, this would not be correct because the models do not
<br>take into account the technical difficulties in cascade
<br>technologies that Iran has not worked out yet. 
<br>
<br>¶51. (S) In the same way, Russia thinks that when talking
<br>about the Shahab-3, there is no possibility of Iran using
<br>these missiles in a launch silo configuration.  Also, Russia
<br>does not see Iran increasing the throw weight or range to the
<br>declared capabilities.  Thus, as regards attempting to draft
<br>a joint report, Russia foresees no problems in an evaluation
<br>of the basic systems, but does foresee a difference in the
<br>evaluations of the technical barriers faced by the Iranians.
<br>With regard to timeframes, Nazarov said that if we talk about
<br>real threats, and not just potential challenges, then we need
<br>to think about all the systems that need to be developed and
<br>tested.  To facilitate this, Russia thinks the JTA
<br>discussions should be divided into discussions on missile
<br>risks and missile threats.  The two sides should agree on
<br>what these are and then work to prevent missile risks from
<br>growing into missile threats. 
<br>
<br>¶52. (S) Nazarov then asked Vladimir Yermakov, Director for
<br>Strategic Capabilities Policy, Russian Ministry of Foreign
<br>Affairs, to introduce Russia's proposed methodology for
<br>evaluating missile risks and missile threats.  Yermakov said
<br>Russia views the December JTA talks as the first step in
<br>implementing the goals of the July 2009 Presidential Joint
<br>Statement.  These consultations build on many years of work
<br>with the U.S. on missile defense, including missile threat
<br>assessment, and Russia would like to underscore that the
<br>dialogue and close collaboration on missile defense is due to
<br>the positive decisions taken by the new administration on
<br>missile defense.  Russia's official assessment of Obama's
<br>missile defense policy is that it is a step in a positive
<br>direction.  Russia commends the U.S. decision to drop the
<br>fielding of missile defense elements in Poland and the Czech
<br>Republic and replace it with a multi-phased program for
<br>missile defense in Europe.  Russia will only be able to give
<br>its assessment of the new
<br> project after it has seen the implementation of the first
<br>phase.  Further collaboration in missile defense will depend
<br>on how the project will be developed on the U.S. side.  But a
<br>key part of our collaboration will be the joint assessment of
<br>missile threats. 
<br>
<br>¶53. (S) Continuing, Yermakov said Russia believes that any
<br>further practical cooperation on missile defense will be
<br>based on a concrete joint assessment of the missile threats.
<br>The U.S. and Russia need to have a clear understanding of
<br>whom we are cooperating against and we need to make clear
<br>distinctions between missile risks, missile challenges, and
<br>missile threats.  Russian and U.S. perceptions may coincide
<br>and may differ, that is understandable.  We can work together
<br>to address threats we both agree on.  But there may be
<br>threats the U.S. sees as real and Russia sees only to be
<br>perceived ones, and vice versa.  In such cases, the extent of
<br>our cooperation may be less or lower, but we can still do
<br>something jointly to address these threats as well. 
<br>
<br>¶54. (S) Yermakov said that Russia sees as an end-goal of the
<br>JTA consultations a document outlining jointly assessed
<br>missile threats and challenges.  Naturally, in working on
<br>such a document, the U.S. and Russia will recognize that
<br>their views differ and those differences will have to be
<br>reflected in this document.  We can take as an example our
<br>record of cooperation within the NATO Russia Council (NRC). 
<br>
<br>¶55. (S) Yermakov then distributed a paper on a framework of
<br>criteria for assessing the level of risk of a given missile
<br>program.  He explained that the material on the first page is
<br>a graph presented in simplified form in which Russia presents
<br>two categories - a threat and a challenge.  In order for
<br>there to be a threat, it is necessary to have two components:
<br> intention and capabilities.  Only when both components are
<br>present does a threat become real.  From the Russian point of
<br>view, lack of either component makes the threat hypothetical.
<br> When both components are lacking, the threat is only
<br>"perceived," and the threat of a nuclear missile strike is
<br>zero. 
<br>
<br>¶56. (S) Yermakov noted that on the second page, Russia
<br>suggests four categories:  missile challenge, missile danger,
<br>missile threat, and missile strike.  Russia views a missile
<br>challenge as an aspiration to obtain capabilities in the
<br>field of rocketry to fulfill one's legitimate national goals.
<br> These goals can be a space program or missiles as weapons.
<br>A missile danger emerges when nations envision in national
<br>guidelines a doctrine that they could/could use missiles.  A
<br>missile threat is a more advanced category in which a country
<br>has the intention to use its missile capability to further
<br>its national military and political goals.  A missile strike
<br>is self evident.  Yermakov urged the U.S to review the paper
<br>and, at a later stage, provide an assessment of this
<br>approach.  At that point, the two sides can compare views,
<br>theoretical approaches and assessments of threats, and use
<br>this framework to develop a joint document of challenges,
<br>risks, and threats. 
<br>
<br>¶57. (S) Nazarov thanked Yermakov for his presentation, saying
<br>that he believed the U.S. and Russia needed to continue their
<br>joint work based on a shared methodology.  The methodology
<br>proposed in the Yermakov presentation will allow us to
<br>address challenges and threats concretely, and to overcome
<br>differences of opinion.  Nazarov said he did not see U.S. and
<br>Russian differences as significant for a joint document and
<br>thought they could be overcome.  In this context, Russia has
<br>prepared  a memorandum with respect to drafting a joint
<br>assessment.  The essence of the paper is that the two sides
<br>would work together to draft a document on a joint
<br>understanding of the problems of missile proliferation.  It
<br>would be an assessment of the current trends, conditions, and
<br>factors that make up today's situation, and appropriate
<br>conclusions. 
<br>
<br>¶58.  Nazarov suggested the two sides agree on a timeframe for
<br>drafting the document, which would lay the foundation for
<br>cooperation and make it more dynamic.  Russia thinks the JTA
<br>work could finish by the end of 2010 and believes that
<br>following this round, the group could come up with a draft
<br>report and then work to improve it and flesh out some of its
<br>provisions.  Based on the principle of rotation, Russia also
<br>thinks the next round of JTA talks should be in March or
<br>April, 2010 in Moscow.  Finally, given the sensitive nature
<br>of the eventual final document, it should be treated as
<br>confidential and only made available to third parties with
<br>the consent of both our parties.  (Passed over non-paper.) 
<br>
<br>¶59. (S) Van Diepen appreciated the thought put into the
<br>Russian document and the invitation to Moscow, which he
<br>accepted.  He said the U.S. would study the paper and provide
<br>comments at a later date.  This will lay the groundwork for
<br>productive meetings in Moscow.  However, he also cautioned
<br>that the two sides must be careful not to let process get in
<br>the way of substance.  He said the U.S. and Russia need to
<br>share assessments first and then think about what to do with
<br>them.  He also said the two sides should identify the
<br>differences in our assessments and the reasons for those
<br>differences, rather than get bogged down in wordsmithing and
<br>nuances. 
<br>
<br>¶60. (C) Nazarov said Russia shares the opinion that the JTA
<br>study has a practical goal.  He said Russia is serious about
<br>the problem of future missile threats and that the JTA work
<br>is under the close scrutiny of the President of the Russian
<br>Federation, who demands that the Russia side give an
<br>impartial and objective assessment.  Russia believes there is
<br>a danger in over- or underestimating the threat as it could
<br>prod us to move in the wrong direction.  When it comes to
<br>missile and nuclear threats, errors in estimation in both
<br>directions are dangerous. 
<br>
<br>¶61. (S) Yuriy Korolev, an expert from the Russian Ministry of
<br>Foreign Affairs, explained that during a meeting in Budapest
<br>in February 2008, Russian experts presented a collection of
<br>interesting approaches on assessing missile proliferation
<br>threats.  Using that document, Russia thought one could give
<br>a more unbiased assessment of missile threats.  However,
<br>there has been no reaction from the U.S.  This may be due to
<br>the fact that only limited numbers of the document were
<br>distributed and they did not reach all appropriate senior
<br>U.S. officials.  Russia continues to believe this document is
<br>interesting and would appreciate U.S. views, analysis,
<br>comments, and proposals on how to make our efforts on
<br>countering missile proliferation more effective.  Russia's
<br>view is that the methodology presented would make assessments
<br>of missile threats more impartial (handed over copies). 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>(U) Russian presentation on the security threat presented by
<br>instability and Islamists in Pakistan and discussion
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>
<br>¶62. (S) Korolev noted that while the focus of the discussions
<br>had been on the missile threats from North Korea and Iran,
<br>Russia did not think discussion should be limited to only
<br>those threats from Iran and North Korea.  In the Russian
<br>view, there is another serious threat that should be
<br>discussed: Pakistan.  Pakistan is a nation with nuclear
<br>weapons, various delivery systems, and a domestic situation
<br>that is highly unstable.  Russia assesses that Islamists are
<br>not only seeking power in Pakistan but are also trying to get
<br>their hands on nuclear materials.  Russia is aware that
<br>Pakistani authorities, with help from the U.S., have created
<br>a well-structured system of security for protecting nuclear
<br>facilities, which includes physical protection.  However,
<br>there are 120,000-130,000 people directly involved in
<br>Pakistan's nuclear and missile programs, working in these
<br>facilities and protecting them.  However, regardless of the
<br>clearance process for these people, there is no way to
<br>guarantee that all are 100% loyal
<br>and reliable. 
<br>
<br>¶63. (S) In addition to the Islamist interest in these
<br>facilities, Russia also is aware that Pakistan has had to
<br>hire people to protect nuclear facilities that have
<br>especially strict religious beliefs, and recently the general
<br>educational and cultural levels in Pakistan has been falling.
<br> Due to these facts, extremist organizations have more
<br>opportunities to recruit people working in the nuclear and
<br>missile programs.  Over the last few years extremists have
<br>attacked vehicles that carry staff to and from these
<br>facilities.  Some were killed and a number were abducted and
<br>there has been no trace seen of them.  Also, even if places
<br>are well protected, transportation of materials is a
<br>vulnerable point.  In Pakistan, it is hard to guarantee the
<br>security of these materials during transportation.  For these
<br>reasons, Russia thinks Pakistan should also be a particular
<br>focus of JTA discussion. 
<br>
<br>¶64. (S) Nazarov clarified that Russia believes the focus of
<br>the JTA discussions should be the missile programs of Iran
<br>and North Korea.  Russia assumes the nuclear and missile
<br>programs of Pakistan are regionally oriented and thus outside
<br>the scope of the current JTA discussion.  However, Russia
<br>recently hosted a delegation led by Senators Hagel and
<br>Harkin.  The Senators told a meeting of the Russian Security
<br>Council that Pakistan poses the greatest threat to the world.
<br> Therefore, Russia would appreciate any additional
<br>information the U.S. can provide on the actual situation with
<br>regard to the protection, storage, and transportation of
<br>nuclear and missile weaponry in Pakistan. 
<br>
<br>¶65. (C) Van Diepen appreciated Russia's concern with Pakistan
<br>and interest in getting further information but noted that
<br>the issue as described is primarily nuclear materials being
<br>acquired by terrorists, it is more of a nuclear issue and
<br>less related to ballistic missiles.  He undertook to report
<br>back and facilitate a response from the appropriate office
<br>outside the context of the JTA. 
<br>
<br>¶66. (S) Nazarov said Russia is interested in using all
<br>channels to cooperate with the U.S. on this subject.  First
<br>and foremost, Russia is talking about the threat of nuclear
<br>terrorism.  If the scenarios include future development, the
<br>threat of missile technology getting into the hands of
<br>terrorists should also be considered.  Russia would like to
<br>put its concern on the record, and particularly with regard
<br>to the possibility of Islamists coming to power in Pakistan.
<br>Russia would appreciate the U.S. providing additional
<br>information on the subject - perhaps at the follow-up meeting
<br>in Moscow. 
<br>
<br>¶67. (C) Van Diepen said he would report Russia's concerns but
<br>noted that the U.S. response would likely come through
<br>diplomatic channels rather than at our April/March meetings.
<br>He also urged that Nazarov raise his concerns with Special
<br>Advisor Holbrooke or his Deputy. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>(U) Russian presentation on FSB work to interdict Iranian and
<br>North Korean attempts to buy restricted technology, or to
<br>transship third party materials through Russia
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
<br>
<br>¶68.  (C) Anatoliy Raikevich, First Deputy Department
<br>Director, Federal Security Service (FSB), said that both Iran
<br>and North Korea appear to depend heavily on illegally
<br>obtaining equipment and technology from abroad for missile
<br>and WMD programs.  The FSB has information that Iran and
<br>North Korea both have programs to try to acquire Russian
<br>technology.  One of the basic tasks of the FSB is to prevent
<br>them from acquiring WMD-related production technology in
<br>Russia.  To do this, the FSB takes action based on Russian
<br>law and export controls.  In particular, the FSB monitors and
<br>takes measures to prevent WMD technology exports.  This
<br>includes criminal investigations of attempts to export
<br>contraband and items on the prohibited list.  Russian
<br>analysis shows that that these efforts have significantly
<br>reduced the achievements of the Iranian security services in
<br>this area.  However, the Iranians continue to try to use the
<br>territory of Russia for transits and reexports of such
<br>materials. 
<br>
<br>¶69. (C) A key effort of the Iranian services is the company
<br>to company approach, whereby they use fake companies run by
<br>the Iranian security service to procure Russian goods.  The
<br>FSB has set up sting companies to uncover Iranian activities.
<br> In the past two years, the FSB has cut off a good deal of
<br>the exports of such technology. 
<br>
<br>¶70. (C) The FSB has determined that Iran is trying to get
<br>equipment such as measuring devices, high precision
<br>amplifiers, pressure indicators, various composite materials,
<br>and technology to create new missile engines from Russia and
<br>from sources in Western Europe.  To produce these items
<br>itself, Iran would need to seriously modernize its
<br>technological base.  To combat this, the FSB must cooperate
<br>with the U.S. and European security services.  Russia has
<br>many years experience cooperating with U.S. security services
<br>and has moved from information exchanges to operational
<br>activities.   The FSB thinks U.S. services are very
<br>professional and well prepared, and hopes cooperation will
<br>continue. 
<br>
<br>¶71. (C) Van Diepen thanked Raikevich for his presentation,
<br>noting that he had had lots of experience during the 1990s
<br>working with Russian counterparts on the problem and trying
<br>to reduce the success of Iran in acquiring missile
<br>technology.  Van Diepen said he was impressed by the people
<br>in Russia working on export controls and appreciated that
<br>Russia recognized that Iran is still trying to acquire
<br>technology from Russia.  He said he would pass on to U.S.
<br>security services the FSB's interest in continued
<br>cooperation.  He added that the U.S. would want to work with
<br>Russia in those channels as well as in diplomatic channels as
<br>the need arose to address specific shipments of concern. 
<br>
<br>¶72. (S) Raikevich replied that discussing these issues with
<br>the U.S. will help Iran and North Korea to "boil in their own
<br>oil."  He said Iran and North Korean may have small successes
<br>here and there with procurement, but the FSB will see to it
<br>that their successes remain small.  The FSB is grateful for
<br>information the U.S. passes along regarding various Russian
<br>organizations that may be working with Iran or North Korea,
<br>and wants continue to work together to prevent the spread of
<br>this technology from Russia and other countries. 
<br>
<br>----------------------
<br>(U) Concluding remarks
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶73. (S) Yermakov said that Russia thought the discussions had
<br>been productive and cooperative.  He noted that both sides
<br>have significant homework assignments to complete before the
<br>next round and can test the results at the end of
<br>March/beginning of April.  He then offered concluding remarks
<br>on behalf of the Deputy Secretary of Russia's National
<br>Security Council:
<br>-- With regard to Iran, Russia believes the possibility of
<br>improvement of its liquid propellant missiles is nil. 
<br>
<br>--It is impossible from the Russian point of view for Iran to
<br>put a nuclear device on existing missiles with an improved
<br>range and throw weight. 
<br>
<br>--Iran has no ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear
<br>weapons at this time, and Russia sees no threat from missiles
<br>in Iran. 
<br>
<br>--In Russia's view, Iran presents a missile challenge. 
<br>
<br>--A missile threat would only develop if Iran seceded from
<br>the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and successfully
<br>developed an MRBM with a 3,000 km range and a warhead of one
<br>ton. 
<br>
<br>--Iran does not have the military-industrial capability to
<br>develop such a program.  If Iran could gain access to foreign
<br>technology, it might develop such a program but this is
<br>unlikely due to export controls. 
<br>
<br>--In any case, even with the assistance of foreign
<br>technology, Russia assesses it will take Iran 6-8 years to
<br>gain the ability to launch an MRBM with a nuclear warhead. 
<br>
<br>--With regard to an ICBM, Russia considers this purely
<br>hypothetical and does not see the possibility of Iran having
<br>this capability for the next 10 years. 
<br>
<br>--For North Korea, Russia assesses that its only real
<br>capabilities are outdated missiles with ranges of no more
<br>than 3,500 km. 
<br>
<br>--While it is possible to develop missiles with greater
<br>ranges based on an SLV program, that would take many years,
<br>even with a successful program. 
<br>
<br>¶74. (C) Yermakov said these were the basic conclusions Russia
<br>wanted to make.  If the conclusions are agreeable to the U.S.
<br>side this could be noted.  If not, they can be discussed
<br>again at a later date and will be the basis for future work,
<br>to continue successful bilateral cooperation.  He said Russia
<br>is not at all concerned about differences regarding various
<br>aspects of these programs.  Russia sees this as natural.
<br>Having differences just means that we need to meet more often
<br>and exchange information through appropriate channels.
<br>Russia looks forward to a U.S. interagency delegation coming
<br>to Moscow.  Until then the two sides can communicate through
<br>diplomatic channels or even just by telephone. 
<br>
<br>¶75. (S) Van Diepen thanked the Russia side, especially
<br>Nazarov, for its thorough preparation and professionalism.
<br>He said the U.S. was pleased with the interagency character
<br>of the Russian delegation and appreciated that Russia had
<br>given a lot of thought to both conceptual issues and
<br>technical matters.  The challenge going forward - as shown in
<br>the contrast between the technical discussions and Russia's
<br>concluding remarks - will be to come to a greater shared
<br>understanding of the issues.  On the technical side, there is
<br>a fair amount of agreement, but as we go up in range, our
<br>views diverge.  Based on common data, we have different
<br>perceptions.   The conclusions the U.S. would draw would be
<br>different in each case from the conclusions Yermakov
<br>outlined.  That is not bad, but both sides need to work to
<br>understand the conceptual and technical basis for these
<br>views.  There is a great deal to discuss, and we will need to
<br>be well prepared for fruitful and informative discussions in
<br>Moscow in the spring.  The U.S.
<br>will study the Russian papers and follow up through
<br>diplomatic channels.  The U.S. also will do its homework
<br>assignments, propose specific dates for the next round of
<br>talks, and be prepared for "our exams" next time in Moscow.
