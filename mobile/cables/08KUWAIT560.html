<br>Classified By: Ambassador Deborah K. Jones for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Officials from the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) and 
<br>Kuwait Finance House (KFH) confirmed to Econoff on May 12 
<br>that they have frozen the accounts of the three terrorist 
<br>financiers Hamed Al-Ali, Jaber Al-Jalahmah, and Mubarak 
<br>Al-Bathali, upon instruction of the MFA. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx told Econoff that CBK had notified 
<br>all Kuwaiti financial institutions to freeze the assets of 
<br>the three individuals in compliance with UNSCR 1267. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>also confirmed to 
<br>Econoff that after receiving official notification from CBK 
<br>to freeze the assets of the individuals, to include their 
<br>government salaries, KFH did freeze the assets and has barred 
<br>all incoming and outgoing bank transactions. xxxxxxxxxxxx also 
<br>underscored KFH's intention to permanently close the three 
<br>accounts in the near future. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Earlier on May 12, on the margins of a meeting with 
<br>S/CT Dailey and the Ambassador (septel), MFA Director of 
<br>Follow-up and Coordination Department assured Econoff that 
<br>the GOK had instructed CBK to freeze the assets of the 
<br>three terrorist facilitators. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) This is a major action by the GOK. While long 
<br>overdue, it is nevertheless a very positive development. 
<br>It demonstrates that when the GOK wants to act against 
<br>terrorism, it can. It is likely that the embarrassment 
<br>over the alleged role of Kuwaiti Guantanamo returnees in 
<br>recent suicide attacks in Iraq played a role in forcing 
<br>the GOK's hand.
