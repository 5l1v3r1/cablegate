<br>SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING SPANISH DEFENSE
<br>MINISTER'S SUGGESTION AGREEMENT ON DEFENSE COOPERATION BE
<br>RAISED TO TREATY STATUS
<br>
<br>REF: A. MADRID 1131
<br>¶B. MADRID 751
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Arnold A. Chacon, for reasons 1.4(B) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) This is an action request. See paragraph 5.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary: MOD Carme Chacon continues to voice,
<br>publicly and privately, her desire to see the U.S. elevate
<br>the Agreement on Defense Cooperation (ADC) to treaty status.
<br>Chacon describes this in terms of legal parity and
<br>equilibrium in the bilateral relationship and has hinted the
<br>current arrangement suggests the U.S. does not value the
<br>agreement as Spain does. Although the agreement runs through
<br>February 2011 (and is automatically renewed in one-year
<br>increments thereafter), given the strategic importance of our
<br>use of the Spanish bases at Rota and Moron, it is vital that
<br>we address the MOD's concerns quickly and try to get this
<br>issue off the media radar. This is particularly urgent given
<br>that the ADC is also regularly in the news because of
<br>continual reporting of alleged detainee flights to Guantanamo
<br>via the bases (septel). End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Spain and the U.S. entered into the current ADC in
<br>1988, with additional protocols dating from 2002. Unless one
<br>of the parties backs out earlier, the ADC is in effect until
<br>February 2011 and is automatically renewed thereafter in
<br>one-year increments. On various occasions Spanish officials
<br>(e.g., MOD Secretary General for Policy Luis Cuesta) have
<br>told us Spain is very satisfied with the ADC, but will seek
<br>various "improvements" in the context of renegotiating a long
<br>term extension of the agreement when the time comes. They
<br>invariably describe these improvements as minor and reiterate
<br>their overall satisfaction with the ADC.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) To our surprise -- and, from what we have been able to
<br>gather, also to her subordinates' surprise -- Chacon in
<br>October mentioned to SECDEF that she wanted the U.S. to
<br>elevate the ADC to treaty status. This happened when the met
<br>very briefly on the margins of the NATO ministerial. Chacon
<br>was convinced SECDEF responded favorably and so advised the
<br>media. Thereafter, Cuesta suggested to us that Chacon
<br>believed an agreement ratified by the U.S. Senate would
<br>underscore the importance of the ADC and the bilateral
<br>relationship. Sources from the Spanish Section of the joint
<br>Permanent Committee which manages implementation of the ADC
<br>have told us they did not know Chacon was going to push the
<br>idea of a treaty (and they seemed to have reservations about
<br>the idea). The MOD Director General for Policy has told this
<br>was something on which Spain would not insist, and we
<br>understand the Spanish DATT in Washington has made similar
<br>statements to OSD contacts.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) However, whatever hope we may have harbored that the
<br>MOD would soon back away from this idea has been shattered by
<br>subsequent conversations with the MOD and by her public
<br>statements. The Ambassador has raised the matter with her
<br>twice in recent weeks, and it was clear that she remained
<br>interested in pursuing a treaty. During a November 25
<br>appearance in congress, Chacon again announced that Spain
<br>wanted to renew the ADC and said that, while the agreement
<br>was being implemented "satisfactorily" in both countries,
<br>Spain would propose that the USG raise it to the level of a
<br>treaty. In answering hostile questions about whether the
<br>Zapatero administration would continue to allow the U.S.
<br>access to Rota and Moron, Chacon defended the ADC.
<br>Nonetheless, she said the MOD and MFA would in 2009
<br>thoroughly examine the implementation of the ADC in hopes of
<br>engaging the new U.S. administration on suggested
<br>improvements. She referenced her October encounter with
<br>SECDEF and described the ADC's renewal as "pending." She said
<br>SECDEF viewed positively her "formal petition that the weight
<br>of the agreement be exactly the same for both countries" and
<br>assured Spanish legislators that the MOD would work the issue
<br>with the new U.S. administration.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Chacon is young and came to her position earlier this
<br>year with little experience in defense matters, but it would
<br>be a serious mistake to underestimate her or fail to respond
<br>substantively to her interest in this issue. She is a savvy
<br>politician and close to President Zapatero. It is rumored
<br>that Zapatero plans not to run again in 2012 and that he
<br>wants Chacon to be his successor. Whether or not that is
<br>true, Chacon is a power player here, and we can be sure that
<br>her interest in seeing the U.S. make the ADC a treaty is more
<br>
<br>
<br>than a whim. The news that Secretary Gates will stay on at
<br>DOD under the new U.S. Administration will only strengthen
<br>her determination to continue on the course she has set. We
<br>suspect she has calculated that a treaty enhances Spain's
<br>status (and hers) and also quiets the left in her party who
<br>are less than enthusiastic about the U.S. military presence
<br>in Spain, but who will be flattered by this evidence that the
<br>U.S. "takes Spain seriously." Whatever the case, we need to
<br>give Chacon a serious response and the sooner the better. We
<br>have of course pointed out that, as the Spanish say, the ADC
<br>has functioned very well for both countries. To the extent
<br>that the Spanish want to seek improvements to the existing
<br>arrangement, we have made clear we are standing by to hear
<br>their suggestions (so far, the only concrete example they
<br>have given us is that because the agreement lacks treaty
<br>status in the U.S., their personnel sometimes have problems
<br>with taxes, driver's licenses, etc.). We have also explained
<br>that treaty ratification in the U.S. is far more complex than
<br>in Spain, where the President of Government has much greater
<br>control over the legislative branch. In their most recent
<br>conversation, the Ambassador persuaded Chacon that it was
<br>time to push this issue back down below the ministerial level
<br>for further discussion, but in order to have that discussion,
<br>we need instructions we can use in explaining the position
<br>(at least initially) of the USG regarding treaty status for
<br>the ADC. The longer we wait, the more often Chacon is likely
<br>to raise the issue publicly, creating a situation in which it
<br>may become very difficult for the Zapatero government to back
<br>down (if indeed we do not intend to pursue treaty status).
<br>We of course defer to the experts in the Departments of State
<br>and Defense, but we strongly recommend that in addition to
<br>providing at least a tentative reaction on the treaty issue,
<br>we also convey every disposition to look at possible
<br>improvements to the ADC and specifically address ways in
<br>which we might alleviate the concerns the Spanish have
<br>expressed regarding the treatment of their personnel in the
<br>U.S.
