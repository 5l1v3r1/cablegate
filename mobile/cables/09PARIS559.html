<br>SUBJECT: FRANCE'S INTERNET PIRACY LAW: UMP CALLING 
<br>TOTO 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: In a theater-of-the absurd 
<br>parliamentary maneuver, France's "three-strikes- 
<br>you're-out" law to crack down on internet piracy was 
<br>torpedoed April 9 by the man (or rather 10 Socialist 
<br>MPs) behind the curtain. The government intends to 
<br>bring the law back for a second reading in the 
<br>National Assembly on April 29, and to a formal vote 
<br>on May 12. GOF sources are confident the government 
<br>will control the vote this time around, though admit 
<br>there are some policy differences within the UMP 
<br>majority (primarily over whether those who are 
<br>ultimately cut off from internet service should pay 
<br>for the balance of their internet subscriptions). 
<br>End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) France's closely-watched graduated response 
<br>law that would deny users access to the Internet after 
<br>three piracy violations was torpedoed by the National 
<br>Assembly on April 9. Olivier Henrard, legal advisor 
<br>to the Minister of Culture and point-person for the 
<br>"Creation and Internet" bill, told us that the 
<br>opposition Socialists had managed to spirit 10 of 
<br>their MPs into a broom closet concealed by a heavy 
<br>curtain in the entranceway to the Chamber. Under 
<br>normal circumstances the majority would have put a 
<br>stop to proceedings had it noticed a cluster of 
<br>oppositions MPs hovering outside the Chamber. But 
<br>with the Socialists out of view, the UMP allowed the 
<br>session's presiding MP, a Socialist, to bring the 
<br>measure to a vote. At which point the MPs rushed from 
<br>their hiding place to cast their "no" votes. (Note: 
<br>It is not uncommon for votes in the National Assembly 
<br>to take place in a near-empty chamber. The final 
<br>"Creation and Internet" law vote was voted down by 21 
<br>Q 15. End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Henrard indicated the government will present 
<br>the same text for a second reading on April 29, 
<br>following a parliamentary recess. Current plans call 
<br>for a final vote on May 12. Although Henrard is 
<br>confident in the bill's ultimate passage, he admitted 
<br>there was some disagreement within the majority over a 
<br>stipulation that requires users who have been 
<br>disconnected from the internet for IP violations to 
<br>continue paying their ISP contracts. An amendment has 
<br>been proposed from the National Assembly floor that 
<br>would alter that arrangement. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) The Socialist opposition, some UMP MPs, and 
<br>consumers groups insist the April 9 defeat was 
<br>indicative of a greater level of discontent over the 
<br>bill than the government cares to admit. UFC-Que 
<br>Choisir, a consumers group linked to the dust-up over 
<br>the 2006 digital copyright law (in which the GOF 
<br>ultimately lost control of proposed legislation in the 
<br>National Assembly), said the MPs had "heard the 
<br>displeasure of consumers." UMP MP Herve Mariton said 
<br>the government "was afraid of its own majority" and 
<br>had tried to pass the bill below the radar (a notion 
<br>rejected by the Culture Ministry's Henrard, who says 
<br>the press regularly turns to the same four or five UMP 
<br>MPs who oppose the bill to generate controversy.) 
<br>
<br>U.S. Industry Views 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) U.S. industry continues to watch the bill 
<br>closely. Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) 
<br>President Robert Pisano told the Charge on March 20 
<br>that the graduated response law is "very important" to 
<br>the fight against online piracy, and to MPAA. The 
<br>Recording Industry of America has expressed similar 
<br>sentiments. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) The Business Software Alliance (BSA) has 
<br>expressed concern over a proposed amendment to Article 
<br>15 of the 2006 French Digital Copyright Law that has 
<br>been included in the "Creation and Internet" bill. 
<br>That article, which industry has contested since its 
<br>inception, requires firms to provide source code of 
<br>software that includes technical protection measures 
<br>to the French authorities. Originally introduced as 
<br>an amendment from the National Assembly floor, the 
<br>measure was designed to address spyware concerns 
<br>(reportedly in the wake of the 2005 Sony rootkit 
<br>scandal in which Sony had sold CDs in the United 
<br>States with copyright protection measures that 
<br>installed onto users' PCs and enabled remote 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000559 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>monitoring). Article 15 has neither been enforced nor 
<br>the subject of implementing regulations since the 
<br>Copyright Law was passed. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) BSA says it had hoped the "Creation and 
<br>Internet" law would fully repeal article 15. Instead, 
<br>the draft amendment would have firms turn over source 
<br>code only "at the request of French authorities," 
<br>rather than automatically, as the law currently 
<br>stipulates. GOF officials, including Henrard, 
<br>advisors to Digital Economy Junior Minister Nathalie 
<br>Kosciusko-Morizet, and the Secretary General of the 
<br>Technical Measures Authority (an independent body 
<br>established to implement aspects of the Copyright law, 
<br>to be replaced by a new body subsequent to passage of 
<br>the "Creation and Internet" law) tell us there is no 
<br>appetite in the GOF for implementing Article 15. But 
<br>outright repeal of a measure passed only two years ago 
<br>by the National Assembly would have opened another 
<br>political front in a legislative climate that was 
<br>proving challenging. And, they say, leaving vague the 
<br>conditions under which a request for source code could 
<br>be initiated allows the GOF to let the provision 
<br>languish. 
<br>
<br>Challenges to Implementation 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) While most observers expect the "Creation 
<br>and the Internet" bill to be approved this time 
<br>around, there are hurdles ahead. Opposition MPs 
<br>intend to make implementation and enforcement as 
<br>difficult as possible, starting with a likely 
<br>challenge before the Constitutional Court (which rules 
<br>on whether new laws comply with France's 
<br>constitution). They have also taken their case to the 
<br>European Parliament, where debate over the right to 
<br>disconnect users from the internet has been injected 
<br>into discussion of the EU telecoms package. The 
<br>Culture Ministry's Henrard decried Socialists' efforts 
<br>to politicize the telecoms package, and indicated the 
<br>GOF would push back on any EU efforts to preclude the 
<br>GOF from implementing its law. (Note: The telecoms 
<br>package is being shepherded through the EP by 
<br>Socialist group MEP Catherine Trautmann, French 
<br>Culture Minister from 1997 Q 2000 in the Jospin 
<br>government. End note.) Socialist MEP candidates for 
<br>the June EP elections are also trying to make 
<br>political hay by stressing the GOF's "contempt for 
<br>representative democracy" in presenting a bill that is 
<br>essentially identical to one so recently rejected by 
<br>the National Assembly. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Then there are the sheer logistical 
<br>challenges of implementing the legislation. Users 
<br>caught downloading illegal content will first receive 
<br>an e-mail warning from the ISP. Following a second 
<br>"strike," users will receive a (computer-generated) 
<br>warning letter in the mail from the soon-to-be- 
<br>established High Authority for the Distribution of 
<br>Works and the Protection of Rights on the Internet 
<br>("HADOPI" in French). Culture Minister Albanel has 
<br>told the National Assembly Cultural Affairs Committee 
<br>that, under a worst-case scenario, the HADOPI would be 
<br>sending out up to 10,000 letters a day. If the same 
<br>user is caught a third time, his or her Internet 
<br>connection will be suspended for up to one year. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Henrard says the independent HADOPI 
<br>authority, whose structure and legal standing will be 
<br>loosely- patterned on France's financial markets 
<br>regulatory authority AMF, will have a 90 million euro 
<br>budget to contact, warn, suspend and deny Internet 
<br>access. It will have the right to obtain and peruse a 
<br>year's worth of personal records from ISPs, order ISPs 
<br>to include new filtering systems in their 
<br>infrastructure and fine them up to 5,000 euros if they 
<br>provide access to "blacklisted" users. But ultimately 
<br>the point of the legislation, Henrard concluded, is to 
<br>sensitize law-abiding citizens to the importance of 
<br>fighting internet piracy through personal 
<br>responsibility (including through such steps as 
<br>locking WiFi connections to keep pirates from 
<br>piggybacking onto ISP accounts). 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Comment: The opposition handed President 
<br>Sarkozy an embarrassing, if temporary, parliamentary 
<br>defeat with this episode. Majority leader Jean- 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000559 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Francois Cope and Parliamentary Relations State 
<br>Secretary Roger Karoutchi both reportedly received 
<br>tongue-lashings from the President after the debacle, 
<br>and press reports suggest Karoutchi even offered to 
<br>tender his resignation. With the UMP's commanding 
<br>majority in parliament, and pressure from the 
<br>President (who personally initiated and supported the 
<br>draft law), the GOF should get its bill through on the 
<br>second reading. But although the bill's initial 
<br>failure was mostly a result of party politics and 
<br>clever parliamentary maneuvering, there are strong 
<br>undercurrents of dissent on the policy. The 
<br>legislation was based on a consultative process that 
<br>included rights-holders, Internet companies and public 
<br>authorities. But an alliance of consumers groups and 
<br>open internet advocates has steadily opposed the 
<br>measure. And their argument that the little guys' 
<br>rights are being trampled by big entertainment 
<br>resonates, even in a country as culturally-sensitive 
<br>as France.
