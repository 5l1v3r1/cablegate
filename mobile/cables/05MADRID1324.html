<br>U.S.-SPAIN RELATIONS 
<br>======================== 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Moratinos said he looked forward to his mid-April 
<br>visit to Washington, the first of several Spanish ministerial 
<br>visits intended to help reinvigorate the bilateral 
<br>relationship, including the visits of the Interior and 
<br>Justice ministers to discuss counterterrorism cooperation. 
<br>Moratinos said it was important, especially for Spain, that 
<br>his visit to Washington convey the sense that U.S.-Spanish 
<br>relations are moving in the right direction.  "We can't 
<br>fabricate a honeymoon, but we must show that there are areas 
<br>where we can work together."  He said Minister of Defense 
<br>Jose Bono had enjoyed a productive meeting with Secretary 
<br>Rumsfeld on the margins of the Nice ministerial and 
<br>anticipated a useful exchange during his early May visit to 
<br>Washington.  Moratinos observed that several military 
<br>contracts involving U.S. companies were in play. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Moratinos recognized the difficulties in bilateral 
<br>relations over the last year, but asserted that Zapatero's 
<br>Socialist government was in a better position to argue for 
<br>strong relations with the USG because the Socialists enjoyed 
<br>greater credibility with traditionally anti-American elements 
<br>in Spanish society and could bring them along.  He suggested 
<br>that the absence of close cultural ties between Spain and the 
<br>U.S. was a factor in the Spanish public's skepticism towards 
<br>the U.S. and urged increased attention by both countries to 
<br>cultural exchanges.  On economic issues, Moratinos said U.S. 
<br>and Spanish officials had recently worked together to resolve 
<br>a trade dispute involving rice and an illegal sale to Iran by 
<br>a Spanish company.  He said Spain was worried about declining 
<br>U.S. investment in Spain and hoped to be able to reverse this 
<br>trend. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) Moratinos praised the visit of President Bush to 
<br>Europe in February, which he said clearly demonstrated the 
<br>USG's willingness to work with the EU as a whole. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) The Deputy Secretary said he understood that the GOS 
<br>was dealing with challenging issues.  He expressed the USG's 
<br>satisfaction with the good level of counterterrorism 
<br>cooperation between Spain and the USG and said he hoped the 
<br>upcoming visits of the Interior and Justice ministers would 
<br>further strengthen our security relationship.  He thanked 
<br>Spain for its leadership of a PRT in western Afghanistan and 
<br>participation in FSB Herat.  The Deputy Secretary noted that 
<br>Afghanistan would require further assistance as the September 
<br>parliamentary elections approached.
