<br>SUBJECT: SENATOR KERRY'S MEETING WITH QATAR'S AMIR 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Joseph E. LeBaron, for reasons 1.4 (b, d). 
<br> 
<br>-------------- 
<br>(C) KEY POINTS 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>--  The Amir of Qatar urged the U.S. in his February 14 
<br>meeting with Senator John Kerry (D-MA) to do everything in 
<br>its power to find a lasting solution to the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The Amir said the best way to 
<br>begin is by moving first on the Syrian track. 
<br> 
<br>--  In Qatar's view, now is the time to reach out to 
<br>Damascus.  The Syrian Government can help Arab extremists 
<br>make tough choices, but only if the U.S., whose involvement 
<br>is essential, demonstrates to Syria early on a willingness to 
<br>address the return of the Golan Heights and supports Turkey's 
<br>mediation efforts between Israel and Syria. 
<br> 
<br>--  According to the Amir, Hamas will accept the 1967 border 
<br>with Israel, but will not say it publicly so as to lose 
<br>popular Palestinian support. 
<br> 
<br>--  The Egyptians' goal, according to the Amir, is to stay in 
<br>the game and maintain their relationship with the U.S., which 
<br>is built around brokering regional peace, for as long as 
<br>possible. 
<br> 
<br>--  The Amir recommended that the U.S. and Qatar establish a 
<br>small bilateral committee to discuss how to advance regional 
<br>peace.  Qatar can help move Hamas, because Qatar does not 
<br>"play in their internal politics."  That does not mean Qatar 
<br>shares Hamas' ideology, stressed the Amir. 
<br> 
<br>--  On Iran, the Amir said President Ahmadinejad is strong 
<br>because he is uncorrupted.  The Amir also advised the U.S. to 
<br>continue ts efforts to open a dialogue with the Iranian 
<br>ladership. 
<br> 
<br>End Key Points. 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C)  Senator Joh Kerry (D-MA), the Chairman of the Senate 
<br>Foreig Relations Committee(SFRC), joined by Ambassador,P/E 
<br>Chief, and SFRC staff member Dr. Jonah Blank met February 14 
<br>with the Amir of Qatar, Hamad bn Khalifa Al Thani.  The 
<br>meeting took place at Waba Palace, the residence of the 
<br>Amir, and the Amir began the meeting by pointing out that the 
<br>comfortable chairs on which the U.S. party was seated were 
<br>made in Syria. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>IMPORTANCE OF THE SYRIAN TRACK 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) This opening led Senator Kerry to remark that he had 
<br>held great discussions with Syria's President, Bashar 
<br>Al-Asad, when he met him in Damascus some months ago.  The 
<br>Amir said President Asad is committed to "big change," but 
<br>Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri's death and complications 
<br>resulting from Syria's alleged involvement in it had brought 
<br>about "complications" for Asad.  The Amir added that "Bashar 
<br>is still young and can grow." 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Senator Kerry said he took away from his visit to 
<br>Damascus that Asad wants change.  The Amir added that the 
<br>Syrian President also wants peace with Israel and that the 
<br>arrival of a U.S. Ambassador in Damascus would help in this 
<br>regard.  Senator Kerry said he had wanted a U.S. Ambassador 
<br>in Syria a year ago, but agreed that the naming of an 
<br>Ambassador is a positive development. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) The Amir cautioned that the Syrians will not accept 
<br>everything the U.S. proposes, stressing that the Israeli 
<br>occupation of the Golan Heights continues and that the return 
<br>of this land to Syria is paramount for Damascus.  The Amir 
<br>observed that the "Syrians have lost confidence in the U.S. 
<br>and that the Israelis now have the upper hand in the region 
<br>because of the support of the United States."  The Israeli 
<br>leaders need to represent the people of Israel, who 
<br>themselves do not trust Arabs.  The Amir said this is 
<br>understandable and "we can't blame them" because the Israelis 
<br>have been "under threat" for a long time. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) What has changed, continued the Amir, is that Arabs 
<br>"for sure" now want two states -- Israel and Palestine.  When 
<br>you consider that many in the region perceive that Hizballah 
<br>drove Israel out of Lebanon and Hamas kicked them (at least 
<br>initially) out "of the small piece of land called Gaza," it 
<br>is actually surprising that the Israelis still want peace. 
<br>The region, however, is still "far away" from peace, 
<br>concluded the Amir. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Senator Kerry responded that in his long experience 
<br>with the region, it was not unusual for people to take 
<br>positions adverse to their own interests.  Yasser Arafat went 
<br>from living as a terrorist in Tunisia to signing an agreement 
<br>with Israel on the White House lawn.  The transformation of 
<br>Arafat is an example of how actors in the region need to take 
<br>risks if we are to move forward in advancing regional peace. 
<br>Turning the conversation back to Syria, Chairman Kerry 
<br>pointed out that Syria's facilitation of arms to Hizballah 
<br>and its turning a blind eye to missile upgrades in Lebanon do 
<br>not represent risk-taking in the promotion of peace. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) The Amir pointed out that any progress toward regional 
<br>peace had come about due to American involvement.  He implied 
<br>that it would take U.S. intervention on the Syrian-Israeli 
<br>track to address these issues and asked Senator Kerry what he 
<br>would have Damascus do. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) The Chairman responded that President Asad needs to 
<br>make a bolder move and take risks.  He observed that if the 
<br>Syrian President wants peace and economic development for his 
<br>country, he needs to be more statesman-like, which would in 
<br>turn help Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu engage him. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) The Amir agreed with Senator Kerry's assessment of 
<br>Asad's aims and said he is ready for peace, but asked if the 
<br>Israelis are ready.  Would Israel accept to resume Turkey's 
<br>mediation between Syria and Israel?  Would the U.S. play a 
<br>role in advancing the Syria track? 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) If we can get Abu Mazen back to the negotiating 
<br>table, we can engage on border issues -- including Israel's 
<br>borders with Syria, advised Senator Kerry.  Abu Mazen right 
<br>now is not strong enough, though, to make necessary 
<br>compromises with Israel because the Palestinian people have 
<br>wanted him to stick to his guns on a settlement freeze and 
<br>the Goldstone Report.  The Chairman added that Netanyahu also 
<br>needs to compromise and work the return of the Golan Heights 
<br>into a formula for peace. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) The Amir encouraged the U.S. to work the Golan 
<br>Heights issue first.  He stressed that Syrians are very 
<br>different from Iranians in "mentality," and said the Syrians 
<br>turned to Iran for support only because they had nowhere else 
<br>to go.  Now is the time, the Amir told Senator Kerry, to 
<br>reach out to Damascus. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>PARAMETERS FOR DISCUSSION 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Senator Kerry responded that the U.S. is prepared to 
<br>play a strong role in bringing about peace in the region. 
<br>President Obama, said the Chairman, understands that he 
<br>personally must engage and do so strongly.  The Senator told 
<br>the Amir that in his speech to the U.S.-Islamic Forum the 
<br>previous evening, the Senator had focused on former President 
<br>Clinton's parameters for peace and the 2002 Arab League peace 
<br>initiative.  Now, said the Senator, is the time to put those 
<br>back on the table and resume talking, with the U.S. acting as 
<br>a legitimate agent of peace.  Chairman Kerry told the Amir he 
<br>is convinced that we can see great progress in the coming 
<br>year by moving swiftly from proximity talks, to direct talks 
<br>between the parties and ending with final status discussions. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) To be successful, continued Senator Kerry, we must 
<br>begin by agreeing at the outset the amount of land each side 
<br>(Israelis and Palestinians) will obtain in the end and use 
<br>that understanding to draw the borders.  If both sides make 
<br>good compromises, we can address the settlement issues in the 
<br>context of giving something up so that the borders, when 
<br>drawn, contain the agreed-upon amounts of land for both 
<br>sides.  The Amir agreed with the Senator's assessment and 
<br>complimented President Obama for being the first U.S. 
<br>President to take on the Middle East conflict in the first 
<br>year of his term. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Continuing the presentation of his ideas on the 
<br>parameters of peace between Israel and the Palestinians, 
<br>Senator Kerry noted that one of the biggest problems for 
<br>Israel is the potential return of 5-6 million Palestinian 
<br>refugees.  The parties broached the return issue in 
<br>discussions at Taba and agreed that the right of Palestinian 
<br>return would be subject to later negotiation, pointed out the 
<br>Chairman.  If we can proceed from that point on the right of 
<br>return, the Senator believes there is an "artful way" to 
<br>frame the negotiations on borders, land swaps, and Jerusalem 
<br>as a shared capital. 
<br>¶15. (C) Any negotiation has its limits, added Senator Kerry, 
<br>and we know for the Palestinians that control of Al-Aqsa 
<br>mosque and the establishment of some kind of capital for the 
<br>Palestinians in East Jerusalem are not negotiable.  For the 
<br>Israelis, the Senator continued, Israel's character as a 
<br>Jewish state is not open for negotiation.  The 
<br>non-militarization of an eventual Palestinian state and its 
<br>borders can nonetheless be resolved through negotiation. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) The Amir underscored that Abu Mazen needs Arab 
<br>support to make the above happen.  Hamas "for sure," he said, 
<br>will accept the 1967 border but will not say it publicly so 
<br>as to lose popular Palestinian support. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>DEALING WITH THE EXTREMISTS 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) Senator Kerry told the Amir he knew Qatar could help 
<br>the U.S. but asked how we deal with those who advocate 
<br>violence.  The Amir said the short answer is to work the 
<br>Syrian track, which means pushing for Israel's return of the 
<br>Golan Heights to Syria.  The Amir said return of the Golan is 
<br>important not just to Syria but also to Hizballah and Iran. 
<br>The U.S. must bear in mind that Misha'al, a leader of Hamas 
<br>based in Damascus, has drawn the conclusion that the Oslo 
<br>accords were bad for Arafat.  He lost the support of his own 
<br>people and died living under Israeli siege.  The Syrians can 
<br>help Misha'al and others make tough choices, but only if the 
<br>U.S. demonstrates to Syria early on a willingness to address 
<br>the Golan.  Senator Kerry responded that the U.S. would 
<br>accept a legitimate discussion of the Golan Heights. 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) What is more, said the Amir, the U.S. needs to 
<br>support Turkey's mediation between Israel and Syria.  It is 
<br>important that the U.S. encourage Israel to understand that 
<br>that resolving the status of the Golan Heights is very 
<br>important to the United States. 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) Senator Kerry asked the Amir if Hamas is under 
<br>pressure given the circumstances in Gaza.  The Amir answered 
<br>by saying that Hamas needs Iranian support.  He added that 
<br>the biggest misconception in the region is that the Syrians, 
<br>who host Hamas leaders in Damascus, go to Iran because they 
<br>like the Iranians.  This is wrong.  Syria goes to those who 
<br>will not shun them. 
<br> 
<br>------------- 
<br>ROLE OF EGYPT 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) Returning to the pressure Hamas is facing, Senator 
<br>Kerry observed that economic development in the West Bank is 
<br>taking place, but not in Gaza.  The Palestinian 
<br>reconciliation that would make possible developmental 
<br>assistance in Gaza has not happened.  The Egyptians have not 
<br>delivered, said Senator Kerry. 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (C) The Amir said the Egyptians' goal is to stay in the 
<br>game and maintain their relationship with the U.S., which is 
<br>built around brokering Middle East peace, for as long as 
<br>possible.  According to the Amir, Fatah and Hamas agreed on a 
<br>memorandum of understanding, but the Egyptians wanted it 
<br>changed.  The Amir remarked that he has a feeling he knows 
<br>which capital (Cairo) is the source of reports that Gaza is 
<br>under pressure.  He said the economic pressure in Gaza on 
<br>families is not what it was.  He offered as an example that 
<br>Qatar Charity recently offered a family in Gaza 500 USD, but 
<br>the family declined the gift saying its members had enough to 
<br>get by and suggested another family that was in more dire 
<br>need of assistance.  The Amir said the notion that a family 
<br>would turn down money is new. 
<br> 
<br>¶22. (C) The Amir told Senator Kerry that everyone knows 
<br>"Egypt has a problem with the Muslim Brotherhood.  Okay, we 
<br>understand.  But Egypt should not expect the world to take 
<br>external actions that would help it internally." 
<br> 
<br>¶23. (C) Asked his advice for President Obama, the Amir 
<br>recommended the establishment of a small U.S.-Qatar committee 
<br>to discuss how to proceed.  Qatar is close to Hamas, 
<br>emphasized the Amir, because "we don't play in their internal 
<br>politics."  That does not mean we share their ideology or do 
<br>not disagree with them.  "I can remember many arguments with 
<br>them (Hamas) on the 1967 border with Israel."  The Amir noted 
<br>that he had mediated with Hamas previously at the U.S. 
<br>request, namely when he urged Hamas at the previous 
<br>Administration's request to participate in Palestinian 
<br>elections. 
<br> 
<br>¶24. (C) Returning to the leadership of Hamas, Senator Kerry 
<br>asked the Amir for his insights into how the leadership, with 
<br>leaders sitting in both Gaza and Syria, makes decisions.  The 
<br>Amir said the impression that Misha'al sits in Damascus and 
<br>others take orders from him is wrong.  Several key players 
<br>within Hamas are involved in decisions.  They have 
<br>differences over policy, but "the bottom line is that they 
<br>all want the Palestinians to take their rights from Israel." 
<br> 
<br>---- 
<br>IRAN 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶25. (C) Senator Kerry observed that the international 
<br>community is moving toward imposing additional economic 
<br>sanctions on Iran.  Understanding and respecting that Qatar 
<br>needs to balance its relationships with regional powers, 
<br>including Iran, the Chairman asked the Amir for his 
<br>perspective on where we are going on Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶26. (C) The Amir answered by affirming that his first 
<br>obligation is to defend the interests of Qatar.  Due to the 
<br>natural gas field Iran shares with Qatar, Qatar will not 
<br>"provoke a fight" with Iran.  He added that in the history of 
<br>the two countries, "Iran has not bothered us."  That said, 
<br>the Amir noted that Iran is an important country in the 
<br>Middle East.  He faulted the U.S. for "making the mistake of 
<br>speaking up for protesters" after the disputed Iranian 
<br>presidential elections. 
<br> 
<br>¶27. (C) The Iranian regime is strong, continued the Amir, 
<br>because President Ahmadinejad is uncorrupted.  "That is the 
<br>secret to his success."  Khatami is also not corrupted, but 
<br>as a reformer he is in a weak position.  Rafsanjani, on the 
<br>other hand, is corrupt. 
<br> 
<br>¶28. (C) Senator Kerry lamented that every communication the 
<br>current Administration has attempted to the Government of 
<br>Iran has gone back channel and been met with no response. 
<br>There have been non-U.S. initiatives, too.  Again, no 
<br>success.  The Chairman observed that the Iranians are scared 
<br>to talk. The Supreme Ayatollah had met with Russian President 
<br>Putin, but seems not inclined to meet with other political 
<br>leaders.  Our instinct is that we need to find a way to talk 
<br>to him. 
<br> 
<br>¶29. (C) Your instinct is right, replied the Amir.  The U.S. 
<br>needs to talk directly with senior Iranian officials.  The 
<br>Amir then asked, "What if I talk to the Iranian President. 
<br>What would you have me say?" 
<br> 
<br>¶30. (C) Senator Kerry responded, "The U.S. seeks serious 
<br>discussion and sought to create a new foundation for a 
<br>relationship based on Iran's non-confrontational compliance 
<br>with IAEA requirements and other mutual interests."  Those 
<br>interests include dealing with drug-running, the Taliban, and 
<br>illicit trade.  The Chairman told the Amir he feared that 
<br>Iran still thinks it is dealing with the 1953 America that 
<br>tried to overthrow the Iranian government. 
<br> 
<br>¶31. (C) The Amir responded that you cannot blame them for 
<br>having that attitude, and Senator Kerry agreed, adding that 
<br>the U.S. has a very different posture in the post-Cold War 
<br>world of today.  Iran has ambitions; I know this from other 
<br>regional leaders, said the Senator.  These are the first 
<br>words that come out of their mouths. 
<br> 
<br>¶32. (C) Iran wants to be a "big power," agreed the Amir, but 
<br>what sort?  He reminded Senator Kerry the U.S. should not 
<br>forget that Iranians are Persian and the U.S. needs to 
<br>approach them in that framework. 
<br> 
<br>¶33. (C) Senator Kerry stressed that the U.S. "would love to 
<br>have that dialogue."  The U.S. respects Iranian civilization 
<br>-- talent, art, culture, etc.  It is crazy to continue on 
<br>this collision course.  The region needs schools and jobs, 
<br>emphasized the Chairman, not another war.  The Amir agreed 
<br>that "demographics are a big worry."  Not just for the 
<br>countries in the region but for the U.S. too. 
<br> 
<br>¶34. (C) Many scientific and technological transformations are 
<br>underway, noted the Senator, "but Iran misinterprets the road 
<br>to being a great power and the degree to which the 
<br>international community is concerned about Iran's acquisition 
<br>of nuclear weapons."  We are at a "fork in the road," and 
<br>Iran must choose between confrontation or building 
<br>partnerships.  If the latter, we can open up new 
<br>opportunities for cooperation in the sciences, technology, 
<br>education, robotics, energy and other ongoing 
<br>transformations. 
<br> 
<br>¶35. (C) Going back to the speech he had delivered in Doha the 
<br>previous evening, Senator Kerry told the Amir that 17 former 
<br>U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense had come out in favor 
<br>of eliminating nuclear weapons.  Every stop closer to 
<br>realizing that goal is a sign of progress, but "no one 
<br>believes Iranian nukes get us closer to that goal." 
<br> 
<br>¶36. (C) Senator Kerry reported that leaders of regional Arab 
<br>countries tell me they want nuclear weapons if the Iranians 
<br>have them.  The Amir responded that he did not believe they 
<br>were serious, but are saying this to put additional pressure 
<br>on Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶37. (C) The Chairman noted that the disputed Iranian 
<br>presidential elections may have derailed U.S. efforts to have 
<br>serious dialogue with Tehran.  The Amir agreed, offering that 
<br>the Israelis are also using Iran's quest for nuclear weapons 
<br>as a diversion from settling matters with the Palestinians. 
<br>The historical backdrop of Arab-Persian relations does not 
<br>help, the Amir added. 
<br> 
<br>-------------- 
<br>FINAL THOUGHTS 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶38. (C) The Amir advised the U.S. to continue trying to open 
<br>a dialogue with the Iranian leadership.  He also told Senator 
<br>Kerry the U.S. needs to tell the Israelis they are causing 
<br>the U.S. to lose the hearts and minds of Muslims.  There was 
<br>a time, such as during the Suez Canal crisis, when the Arabs 
<br>loved the Americans and disliked the British and French, he 
<br>said. 
<br> 
<br>¶39. (C) Senator Kerry asked the Amir how the U.S. goes about 
<br>changing its reputation.  The Amir said first and foremost 
<br>the U.S. must do everything in its power to find a lasting 
<br>solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the best 
<br>way to begin is by moving first on the Syrian track. 
<br> 
<br>¶40. (C) The Chairman of the SFRC said he expects a genuine 
<br>effort by the President this year on an agreement and 
<br>expressed his hope that Iranian issues would not complicate 
<br>matters.  The Amir agreed, adding that China likes the 
<br>distraction for the U.S. as its forces fight in Iraq and 
<br>Afghanistan. 
<br> 
<br>¶41. (C) Senator Kerry concurred, noting that China is lending 
<br>the U.S. money and expanding its influence at U.S. expense. 
<br>He added that he ran against President George W. Bush saying 
<br>the war with Iraq was the wrong war in the wrong place and 
<br>time. 
<br> 
<br>¶42. (C) The Amir closed the meeting by offering that based on 
<br>30 years of experience with the Iranians, they will give you 
<br>100 words.  Trust only one of the 100. 
<br> 
<br>¶43. (U) CODEL Kerry has cleared this message.
