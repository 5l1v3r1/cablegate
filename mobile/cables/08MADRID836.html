<br>TO MADRID
<br>
<br>Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission, Hugo Llorens, reasons: 1.5 (b)
<br>and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Treasury Under Secretary Stuart A. Levey,
<br>accompanied by Chief of Staff Christy Clark and Policy
<br>Advisor DeAnna Fernandez, traveled to Madrid, Spain July
<br>15-17, 2008 to press for Spanish support for implementation
<br>of UNSCR 1803 per the EU-3 1 proposal and to provide
<br>information on the Iranian shipping line IRISL and on threats
<br>to the insurance industry. Spanish officials said they had
<br>no "substantive" objections with the EU-3 1 proposal,
<br>although they did not unequivocally commit to support
<br>implementation of the proposal prior to the August holidays.
<br>Spanish officials received the information U/S Levey provided
<br>on IRISL and insurance with great interest. The Under
<br>Secretary, together with Ambassador Aguirre, thanked a Repsol
<br>representative for the company decision not to pursue the
<br>South Pars Block 13 gas deal. U/S Levey also participated in
<br>an AmCham hosted lunch and engaged in press outreach. End
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>UNDER SECRETARY LEVEY'S MESSAGE WITH GOS OFFICIALS
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Under Secretary stressed in all of his meetings
<br>the USG's commitment to a diplomatic solution to the Iranian
<br>nuclear issue, underscored by the decision to send Under
<br>Secretary Burns to participate in the Geneva meeting with
<br>Iran as one more indication of the USG's firm commitment to
<br>reach a diplomatic solution. In order to facilitate that
<br>solution, it was necessary to present Iran with a "stark"
<br>choice, either conform to UNSCR resolutions or face isolation
<br>and stronger economic sanctions. Levey emphasized that the
<br>EU's decision in June to designate Bank Melli was a strong
<br>action that sent an important signal that the EU was prepared
<br>to be firmer with Iran. This was why it was so necessary for
<br>Spain to support implementation of UNSCR 1803 per the EU-3 1
<br>proposal prior to the August vacation. The Under Secretary
<br>also provided information on the Iranian shipping line,
<br>IRISL. He said that in 2007, IRISL ships had been
<br>interdicted, and that in several instances, the ships had
<br>been carrying prohibited items to Iran. IRISL had also
<br>engaged in deceptive practices involving, among other things,
<br>the falsification of shipping documents and operating through
<br>a company called Seibow Limited. Additionally, Levey noted
<br>that UNSCR 1737 requires measures to prevent the provision of
<br>financial services related to the transfer of prohibited
<br>items to Iran. There had been a great deal of success in
<br>convincing the banking sector to be extremely vigilant in
<br>dealing with Iran. The U.S. now wants to expand vigilance to
<br>the insurance industry as well. The Under Secretary also
<br>raised questions regarding the possible collaboration between
<br>Iran and a Libyan-owned bank.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS MEETING
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Under Secretary met with International Economic
<br>Relations and Energy Affairs Director General Rafael Conde de
<br>Saro and two staff members. The MFA officials said that
<br>Spain has no "substantive" problems with the EU-3 1 UNSCR
<br>1803 implementation proposal, but it was not clear whether
<br>Spain would support implementation of the proposal prior to
<br>the August holidays. The MFA officials added that perhaps
<br>other EU members might have problems with the substance
<br>and/or timing. Levey indicated that there was a very clear
<br>reduction of Iranian activity in Spain deriving from various
<br>sanctions adopted at different levels. Spain had been
<br>scrupulous in its application of sanctions. De Saro and his
<br>staff received the Under Secretary's information on IRISL and
<br>insurance with interest. Conde indicated that he was not
<br>aware of any Spanish operations with IRISL or of Spanish
<br>insurance for IRISL, but that the appropriate Spanish
<br>authorities would be informed.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------
<br>MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY, TOURISM AND
<br>TRADE MEETING
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) U/S Levey met with Ministry of Industry, Tourism and
<br>Trade Secretary General for Foreign Trade Alfredo Bonet and
<br>staff. Bonet expressed support for vigilance and caution
<br>with respect to transactions with Iran. He said that Repsol
<br>had made a "tough decision" not to pursue the South Pars
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000836 002 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>deal. With respect to export credits, a staff member said
<br>that Spain was "freezing" export credit levels to Iran.
<br>Responding to U/S Levey' questions regarding what a "freeze"
<br>means, the official said that it meant capping export credit
<br>levels to Iran. New deals can be approved, although the
<br>staff member said that export credit transactions with Iran
<br>were decreasing because it was difficult to find a bank
<br>willing to finance the deal. Bonet received the information
<br>U/S Levey provided with respect to IRISL and insurance with a
<br>great deal of interest. He said that recently, the ministry
<br>had imposed new information requirements for companies
<br>seeking to export possible dual use items. Now, the firms
<br>have to specify the means of transportation (including the
<br>identity of the shipping company) and for information on
<br>transit countries. For shipments to Iran, it was common
<br>practice to have the Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (CNI -
<br>Spain's main intelligence organization) check the end user
<br>and middlemen links for some operations, often delaying them
<br>for up to a month. If there is a potential risk or doubt
<br>about the information Iran provides, the Ministry requests
<br>further information or denies the operation. Ministry staff
<br>also noted that Spanish banks have closed representative
<br>offices in Iran.
<br>
<br>-------------------
<br>MEETING WITH REPSOL
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Ambassador Aguirre and Under Secretary Levey thanked
<br>Repsol YPF General Counselor and Secretary to the Board Luis
<br>Suarez de Lezo for Repsol's decision not to go ahead with the
<br>South Pars Block 13 deal. Suarez said that Repsol's decision
<br>had been a "cruel" one. However, Spain was "sensitive" to
<br>the problem of terrorism. Suarez said that the company had
<br>delayed making a decision for as long as possible, and that
<br>it still has hopes for business in Iran once the nuclear
<br>issue is dealt with. Suarez said that, so far, Repsol had
<br>not been lucky in developing business in Iraq, mostly because
<br>the competition from bigger rivals was too tough. However,
<br>Repsol had been very successful in making new discoveries in
<br>Brazil and Libya.
<br>
<br>------------------------------------
<br>MEETING WITH THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) U/S Levey and DCM met with Economy Ministry Secretary
<br>of State David Vegara and staff. The U/S stressed the
<br>importance of Spain supporting the EU-3 1 UNSCR
<br>implementation proposal. One Vegara staff member suggested
<br>that Spain was already largely implementing the proposal
<br>through increased banking vigilance, but Levey pointed out
<br>that the EU-3 1 proposal contained other important elements
<br>as well. The staff member said that Spain was working with
<br>the U.S. within the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to
<br>develop guidance on how to implement UNSCR 1803 (including on
<br>"counter-measures"), and U/S Levey thanked him for that
<br>support. Vegara said that Spain was on the right side of
<br>this issue, and on the matter of containing export credit
<br>operations, Spain had reduced export credits by 30 percent.
<br>The Secretary of State expressed a great deal of interest in
<br>the IRISL and insurance information provided by U/S Levey.
<br>Vegara noted, however, that while Spain has large banks, it
<br>does not have large insurance companies, so he doubted that
<br>they were involved in insuring cargo destined for Iran, but
<br>the government would look into it. Secretary of State Vegara
<br>underscored that Spain was committed to the Iran financial
<br>sanctions issue, but that Spain had to coordinate with other
<br>EU members. He expressed a great deal of interest in Under
<br>Secretary Burns' meeting with Iranian officials. DCM
<br>emphasized in this context the need for the international
<br>community to continue to make clear the "stark" choice that
<br>Iran faces precisely in order to give diplomacy a better
<br>chance to work. There was also a discussion of the risk
<br>posed by possible collusion between Libyan-owned banks and
<br>Iran. Vegara and his staff indicated that there was only one
<br>such bank in Spain and they would look into the matter.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------
<br>MEETING WITH THE CENTRAL BANK
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) U/S Levey and DCM met with Deputy Governor Jose Vinals
<br>and staff. He too demonstrated great interest in the
<br>material the U/S provided. Vinals agreed with Levey that
<br>Spanish banks were increasingly unwilling to take any risks
<br>with respect to Iran. He said that Banks Santander and
<br>Sabadell had ceased Iran-related operations, and that, as far
<br>as he knew, Spanish banks had closed their representation
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000836 003 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>offices in Iran. When Levey raised concerns about the risk
<br>posed by possible collusion between Libyan-owned banks and
<br>Iran, Vinals and his staff also indicated that there was only
<br>one Libyan-owned bank in Spain, Aresbank. They noted that
<br>while Aresbank was Libyan-owned, it was managed by Spanish
<br>officials. They indicated that the majority of Aresbank's
<br>business was financing equipment and transport to Libya,
<br>which was necessary since roughly 30 percent of Spain's oil
<br>imports come from Libya. Vinals, nonetheless , noted that
<br>any Libyan-owned bank merited extra scruitiny.
<br>

<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Under Secretary Levey's trip was very timely given the
<br>upcoming EU decision on the EU-3 1 UNSCR 1803 implementation
<br>proposal. We do not know whether Spain will support
<br>implementation prior to the summer holidays. However,
<br>although the Spaniards, especially the Ministry of Foreign
<br>Affairs, played the perennial Brussels-Member State dance,
<br>i.e. suggesting that others might be to blame for an outcome
<br>not desired by the USG, we think the GOS understands that we
<br>are monitoring Spain's stance on this issue very carefully.
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Under Secretary Levey has cleared this message.
