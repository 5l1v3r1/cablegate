<br>SUBJECT: TURKMENISTAN: TRANSITING IRANIANS: HOW THEY VIEW
<br>EVENTS AT HOME 
<br>
<br>REF: 09 ASHGABAT 1547
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Sylvia Reed Curran. Reasons: 1.4(b) an
<br>d (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The process of canvassing Iranians waiting at the
<br>Turkmen-Uzbek border is not exactly scientific.
<br>Nevertheless, chatting with truckers at various points
<br>throughout the border town of Farap is as close as one might
<br>get, outside of Iran, to a Masshad "street." Most come from
<br>Masshad or other towns in northern Iran, and conversations
<br>with them offer a candid glimpse of how working class
<br>Iranians view events at home. Iran Watcher spoke with
<br>several groups of Iranians passing through Farap xxxxxxxxxxxx. 
<br>Those conversations brought out divergent, sometimes
<br>surprising, points of view.
<br>
<br>"In a year, ahmadinejad will be out"
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) At "Cafe Zaineb," part of a truck stop and guest house
<br>just off the main road that caters to Iranian and Turkish
<br>truckers (reftel), we spoke to a group xxxxxxxxxxxx. They were accompanied by 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx, in his late
<br>fifties and something of a firebrand, declared, "Just wait a
<br>year. When the revolution takes place, Ahmadinejad will be
<br>out and Moussavi will be president." (He repeated himself,
<br>partly in broken Russian, just to be sure we understood).
<br>Underscoring his strong dislike for Iran's leaders, he said
<br>emphatically, "The mullahs and Ahmadinejad? They can all go
<br>to hell." When asked how other Iranians he knows view the
<br>situation, xxxxxxxxxxxx said, "I assure you: 70 percent of the
<br>people feel just like I do. We just can't say it openly.
<br>Everyone talks in whispers." xxxxxxxxxxxx, wanted to know, "Is it true that America doesn't
<br>want Iran to have nuclear energy? Why?" (Most of the group
<br>seemed surprised to hear that nuclear weapons, not energy,
<br>are the cause of concern.)
<br>
<br>The secretary's human rights speech: tucked out of sight
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) We passed out Farsi-language copies of Secretary
<br>Clinton's December speech "On the Human Rights Agenda for the
<br>21st Century," as well as U.S.-Iran flag pins (a big hit).
<br>Several of the truckers said, "We need to read this here.
<br>We'll be in big trouble if they catch us with it in Iran."
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx however, asked for extra copies. "I'm not worried,"
<br>he said. "I'll hide them in my truck. I want my children to
<br>read this."
<br>
<br>"Obama has not kept his promises"
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In the evening, we met up with another group of
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx truckers. xxxxxxxxxxxx said he was delighted to be meeting an
<br>American, "for the first time in my life." (He pulled out a
<br>digital camera to record the event.) With a wife and three
<br>children xxxxxxxxxxxx, he spends more time on the road than at
<br>home. Possessing a knack for languages, he has picked up
<br>both Russian and Uzbek, and has also mastered the Tajik
<br>dialect of Farsi during trips to Dushanbe. While traveling
<br>through Central Asia, he enjoys drinking and visiting
<br>discotheques.
<br>
<br>9/11 conspiracy theories
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) When asked how Iranians view current events at home,
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx opined that, "Some people might not like individual
<br>leaders or clerics, but overall, they want an Islamic form of
<br>government. That's why people are basically happy with the
<br>regime." On the question of how Iranians view the U.S., he
<br>said, "Obama promised a lot when he was running for
<br>president. He said he would end the U.S. occupation in Iraq
<br>and Afghanistan and close Guantanamo, but he's done none of
<br>it." xxxxxxxxxxxx said that in his view, neither military action was
<br>justified, including the war in Afghanistan. "Don't
<br>Americans understand about 9/11? The whole thing was devised
<br>
<br>Ashgabat 00000118 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>by Bush." His companion xxxxxxxxxxxx echoed, "Yes, it was all a
<br>pretext for America's so-called war on terror." Both men
<br>went on to qualify their statements with, "We're no fans of
<br>the Taliban. Did you know that they tell their suicide
<br>bombers that they'll go to paradise if they kill five
<br>Shiites?" (This was followed by questions about Christian
<br>sects, and whether Catholics and Orthodox Christians have as
<br>many problems between them as Sunni and Shiite Muslims.)
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) COMMENT: An estimated 70,000 Iranians, mostly
<br>truckers, pass through Turkmenistan every year.
<br>Conversations with them are informative not just for us.
<br>Those we meet also appear anxious to learn about the U.S.
<br>Our discussions are on a wide range of topics, not just
<br>political issues. One Kurdish driver at a truck stop on the
<br>road to Mary, when he learned Iran Watcher was American,
<br>asked for news of Homeyra, an Iranian singer residing in Los
<br>Angeles. "I've heard she's ill," he said worriedly. "Do you
<br>know if that's true?" END COMMENT.
