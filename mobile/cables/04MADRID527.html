<br>Summary 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Polls one month before the March 14 Spanish general 
<br>election continue to point to victory for the Popular Party 
<br>and Aznar's successor as party leader, Mariano Rajoy. The PP 
<br>hopes not just for a plurality, but for an absolute majority. 
<br>Were the PP to fall far short of an absolute majority, 
<br>coalition formation would prove troublesome. Most polling 
<br>consistently shows the PP hovering just short of the absolute 
<br>majority threshold. Socialist leader Rodriguez Zapatero has 
<br>sought to breathe new life into his campaign by exploiting 
<br>the Iraq/WMD controversy, criticizing Aznar for joining the 
<br>Iraq coalition. Most analysts believe the Iraq issue will 
<br>not be a major factor unless Spain's 1300 troops in Iraq 
<br>suffer large casualties. One month before the election, the 
<br>outlook is similar to when Rajoy became Aznar's successor 
<br>last September: the perception in Spain is that it is Rajoy's 
<br>race to lose. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Major Party Differences on Relations with the U.S. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) On March 14, Spaniards will go to the polls to 
<br>select a new Parliament, which will, in turn, select a new 
<br>Prime Minister, known in Spain as "President of the 
<br>Government." Polling data and political commentary have, for 
<br>the past six months, pointed to a plurality for the PP, led 
<br>by Aznar's successor as party leader, Mariano Rajoy. This 
<br>trend continues. Most polls show the PP leading by seven or 
<br>eight points over the Socialists. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Rajoy and Socialist (PSOE) leader Jose Luis 
<br>Rodriguez Zapatero offer distinct domestic and foreign policy 
<br>choices to the Spanish electorate. Rajoy has pledged to 
<br>maintain Aznar's strong ties with the US, including its close 
<br>counter-terrorism cooperation and participation in the Iraq 
<br>coalition. He also promises to keep Spain's vigorous economy 
<br>on track and preserve the integrity of the Spanish state in 
<br>the face of nationalist pressures in the Basque and Catalunya 
<br>regions. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Zapatero, in contrast, pledges to re-focus Spain on 
<br>Europe. Zapatero argues that Aznar's tilt to the US has 
<br>damaged Spain's standing in the EU, where the Socialists see 
<br>their country's future. Zapatero has been a relentless 
<br>critic of Aznar's Iraq policy and what he sees as Aznar's 
<br>"subservience" to the Bush Administration. Zapatero says he 
<br>will establish a transatlantic relationship based on "mutual 
<br>respect and friendship," not on submission. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Zapatero also strongly criticized Aznar for appearing 
<br>before a joint meeting of Congress February 4, saying that 
<br>Aznar was willing to go before the US Congress while ignoring 
<br>Socialist calls for him to appear before a special session of 
<br>the Spanish parliament (in recess because of the elections) 
<br>to explain pre-war intelligence on WMD in Iraq. On the 
<br>domestic front, Zapatero pledges to increase social spending 
<br>for education, health and culture. He has promised not to 
<br>raise taxes and says he will pay for these programs by 
<br>reducing defense spending. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Despite efforts to shift attention again to Iraq, 
<br>Zapatero has been unable to turn popular opposition to 
<br>Aznar's Iraq policy (which brought millions of Spaniards into 
<br>the streets in February and March 2003) into support for his 
<br>candidacy. On February 12, Zapatero said that if elected, he 
<br>would withdraw Spanish troops from Iraq in July if the 
<br>mission had not been turned over to the UN by that date. 
<br>Zapatero misses no opportunity to call the war "illegal and 
<br>immoral" and to denounce Aznar for ignoring Spanish interests 
<br>by allying Spain with what Zapatero calls "the most 
<br>conservative US Administration in history." 
<br>
<br>Role of Aznar 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The manager of the PP's national campaign, Gabriel 
<br>Elorriaga (who is also State Secretary for Public 
<br>Administration), told us in late January that one of the 
<br>major challenges for the PP in the campaign is how to deploy 
<br>Aznar. Elorriaga conceded that the PP needs to be careful 
<br>not to overshadow Rajoy or antagonize the Socialist ranks and 
<br>provoke greater Socialist turnout. Nonetheless, thus far, 
<br>and consistent with his personal style, Aznar has been out in 
<br>front ) and far more on the attack than Rajoy. On February 
<br>10, in a typical jibe, Aznar declared that the Socialists 
<br>have no coherent leader or party and are not fit to govern 
<br>Spain. He demanded that Zapatero tell Catalan Socialists to 
<br>break their coalition with the Catalan Republican ERC, whose 
<br>leader, Carod Robira, met with ETA leaders in France in early 
<br>January. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Zapatero continues to focus his criticism largely on 
<br>Aznar, rather than Rajoy. Rajoy's strategists tell us 
<br>privately that this suits them just fine because the Iraq 
<br>issue in particular is identified with Aznar, rather than 
<br>Rajoy. Thus Aznar takes the heat while Rajoy enjoys a 
<br>widespread reputation, even among Socialists, as more of a 
<br>bridge-builder, with a far less dominating personality than 
<br>Aznar. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Some in his own party have criticized Rajoy, a 
<br>veteran of eight years in key Ministerial portfolios in 
<br>Aznar's two governments, for conducting an overly scripted 
<br>and risk-averse "rose garden" campaign. Rajoy has resisted 
<br>pressure from the Socialists to publicly debate Zapatero, for 
<br>example. Others point out, however, that Spaniards vote 
<br>according to party lists, not necessarily on personalities -- 
<br>a key difference between the Spanish and US systems -- and 
<br>therefore the lack of a high profile is not necessarily a 
<br>negative for Rajoy. 
<br>
<br>Absolute Majority: the Numbers and Turnout 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The PP needs 176 seats in the 350-seat Congress of 
<br>Deputies (lower house) to form an absolute majority. In 
<br>2000, the PP won an absolute majority of 183 seats. In 1996 
<br>the PP won 146 seats and formed a coalition government. Some 
<br>of the 1996 coalition partners, such as the Basque 
<br>Nationalist PNV, would not enter into a coalition with PP 
<br>today. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) PP campaign manager Elorriaga told us he was 
<br>confident the PP would win at least 171 seats this time and 
<br>said that if the campaign went well, the PP could hope for an 
<br>absolute majority, although he conceded this would be 
<br>difficult. Elorriaga believed that the 183 seats the PP 
<br>received in 2000 represented the PP's electoral ceiling. He 
<br>doubted they would reach it in 2004 given the eight years of 
<br>PP government and the natural desire of the public for a 
<br>change. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Should the PP fall four or five seats short of 176, 
<br>Elorriaga said they can count on the Canary Coalition (a 
<br>regional Canary Islands party) to cover that margin. Beyond 
<br>that, coalition formation becomes problematic for the PP. 
<br>Most PP analysts believe that CIU, the moderate Catalan 
<br>nationalist party (which had 15 seats last legislature), 
<br>would be willing to work out a deal with the PP, if it came 
<br>to that. However PP strategists are not sure this would 
<br>happen and would like to avoid this contingency. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) PP strategists and other analysts, including 
<br>Elorriaga, focused on the issue of voter turnout. Elorriaga 
<br>told us that the PP wanted to mobilize its people but avoid 
<br>public gloating that could antagonize the Socialists and 
<br>mobilize them against the PP. He said polls before the 1993 
<br>general election had been favorable for the PP but that the 
<br>PP had committed the error of holding large rallies on the 
<br>eve of the election that, ironically, mobilized the 
<br>socialists against them and helped cost the PP the election. 
<br>Elorriaga said that over-confidence was a major danger for 
<br>the PP. 
<br>
<br>The Alternative to a PP Victory: Government of the Left 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) The likely alternative to a PP victory is a 
<br>coalition of the Socialists and the Left Union (Communists) 
<br>supported by nationalists such as the Basque Nationalist 
<br>Party (PNV). Zapatero has stated that he would not seek to 
<br>form a government unless the Socialists get the most votes 
<br>nationwide. Nonetheless, many analysts believe that if it 
<br>came to it, the Socialists would lead such an "anybody but 
<br>the PP" coalition. The PSOE sought to do it in the Madrid 
<br>region last October and have done it in the Balearic Islands 
<br>and elsewhere. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) The percepction in Spain is that the March 14 
<br>election remains the PP's to lose. Despite polls that show 
<br>that a majority of Spaniards favors the idea of a change in 
<br>government, the PP has enjoyed a solid lead for months. The 
<br>Socialists, as a consequence of their disunity and weak 
<br>leadership, have been unable to capitalize on a general 
<br>desire for change. However, there are a few wildcards that 
<br>have the potential to change the equation. These include 
<br>possible large Spanish casualties in Iraq and a possible 
<br>backfiring of Rajoy's cautious approach to campaigning and 
<br>his unwillingness to debate Zapatero. Nonetheless, as it now 
<br>stands, the majority of analysts, including many Socialist 
<br>contacts, expect the PP to form the next government. What 
<br>they do not agree on is whether the PP will receive an 
<br>absolute majority. The polling is inconclusive. If Zapatero 
<br>can prevent the PP from gaining an absolute majority ) which 
<br>would involve the PP's loss of at least 8 seats ) he might 
<br>be able to claim some victory and remain PSOE leader. Should 
<br>the PP win an absolute majority, the knives among the 
<br>Socialists may well come out for Zapatero. A resounding 
<br>PSOE electoral defeat, were it to occur, might well bring 
<br>calls for one of the longtime Socialist barons, such as Bono 
<br>from Castilla La Mancha or Chavez from Andalusia to come to 
<br>the PSOE's rescue.
