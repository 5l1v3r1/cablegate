<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR PM BERLUSCONI'S OCTOBER 31 MEETING
<br>WITH THE PRESIDENT
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Spogli, for reasons 1.4 (b)(d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. PM Berlusconi specifically requested this
<br>meeting, and a spring address to a joint session of Congress,
<br>to bolster his prospects in Italy's April elections. Behind
<br>in the polls and facing his toughest campaign, Berlusconi
<br>will juxtapose his proactive and pro-U.S.foreign policy with
<br>that of his likely center-left opponent, Romano Prodi, who
<br>prefers to follow an EU foreign policy lead and has called
<br>for a timetable to withdraw Italian troops from Iraq. GOI
<br>officials are concerned about a potential terrorist attack,
<br>either during the Turin Winter Olympics or the spring
<br>elections.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Berlusconi will seek: (a) presidential statements of
<br>support on shared values; (b) support for extending in 2005
<br>the UN mandate on Iraq; (c) tangible progress on a plan to
<br>enhance Iraqi security capabilities and allow a coordinated
<br>drawdown of Italian forces; and (d) the President's possible
<br>intervention to waive or delay new passport requirements for
<br>continued Italian participation in the Visa Waiver Program.
<br>We should: (a) offer appropriate praise for Italy's foreign
<br>policy support without jeopardizing our relationship with
<br>Prodi; and (b) engage Berlusconi on Russia and Iran. End
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>Italian Elections
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) PM Silvio Berlusconi prides himself on his warm
<br>relationship with the President and has carefully planned
<br>this meeting and a spring address to a joint session of
<br>Congress (he meets Speaker Hastert before going to the White
<br>House) to bolster his prospects in Italy's national
<br>elections, tentatively scheduled for April 9. Berlusconi's
<br>center-right coalition is down eight points in the polls,
<br>undermined by internal leadership spats and continued
<br>economic stagnation. The center-left also is plagued by
<br>internal disputes but former European Commission President
<br>Romano Prodi just won a triumphant electoral victory in the
<br>primaries. Pending electoral law changes may slightly
<br>increase the odds for the center-right, and it is too early
<br>to deal Berlusconi out. However, most political observers
<br>predict Prodi's center-left coalition will win in April.
<br>
<br>Iraq: Seeking a Way Forward
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) We expect Berlusconi will juxtapose his proactive,
<br>pro-U.S. foreign policy with that of Prodi, who prefers to
<br>follow an EU foreign policy lead and has publicly called for
<br>a timetable to withdraw Italian troops from Iraq. Berlusconi
<br>has remained adamant that Italian troops will stay in Iraq
<br>until the security situation warrants, and the Iraqi
<br>government requests, a drawdown of Italian troops. The
<br>center-right has already accused Prodi of encouraging
<br>terrorist attacks on Italy through reckless calls for
<br>withdrawal. However, Italian public opinion remains
<br>overwhelmingly opposed to the war in Iraq and Berlusconi will
<br>be under increasing pressure to make public statements about
<br>plans to withdraw troops. He will be reassured by
<br>commitments of continued high-level consultations but would
<br>better appreciate progress in enhancing Iraqi security
<br>capabilities in a way that allows measured Italian drawdowns
<br>by April. Italy is also seeking an extension of the UN Iraq
<br>mandate by the end of the year; the Italian presence is
<br>premised on the UN mandate, and Parliament will vote in
<br>January on the next six-months of funding for thier troops.
<br>Italy also feels that the mandate extension should
<br>specifically reference political progress in Iraq.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) We can and will work with a Prodi-led government
<br>should the center-left win next year. Despite Prodi's calls
<br>for a withdrawal timetable, other elements of his center-left
<br>coalition have assured us that Italy will not make any
<br>dramatic Zapatero-style actions and will coordinate changes
<br>in troop levels with both us and the Iraqi government. Prodi
<br>himself has hinted at a compromise formula involving
<br>continued Italian involvement in Iraq for reconstruction
<br>initiatives.
<br>
<br>Strongest Ally in Continental Europe
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Berlusconi will be seeking Presidential statements
<br>of support on shared values for our freedom agenda and praise
<br>for Italy's substantial commitment of resources overseas. In
<br>addition to being the third largest contributor of troops to
<br>MFN-I, Italy also funds reconstruction and justice projects
<br>in Iraq, leads ISAF, a PRT and a justice initiative in
<br>Afghanistan, just took over KFOR command, pledged $3 million
<br>to the UN Fund for Democracy, indicated it will fund the new
<br>Foundation for the Future, co-hosts Democracy Assistance
<br>Dialogue initiatives with Turkey and Yemen, and provided
<br>earthquake and hurricane relief for Pakistan and New Orleans.
<br>We want to provide appropriate praise without jeopardizing a
<br>potential future relationship with a center-left government.
<br>
<br>Budget Woes
<br>-----------
<br>¶7. (C) High public debt, rising social welfare costs and a
<br>stagnant economy are limiting Berlusconi's ability to
<br>maneuver in the face of growing domestic economic discontent.
<br>Pocketbook issues will drive the campaign and be
<br>Berlusconi's biggest challenge, although Prodi has yet to
<br>offer any credible alternative economic policy. The draft
<br>budget now being debated by the Italian Parliament must be
<br>approved by the end of the year, and it appears it will
<br>include painful cuts in many sectors. This includes
<br>potentially dramatic (to about .85% of GDP) cuts in the
<br>defense budget and a 20% reduction in the overseas deployment
<br>budget that could undermined Italy's ability to sustain its
<br>overseas commitments.
<br>
<br>Terrorist Threat Looms Large
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Following the London bombings, the GOI approved a
<br>strong anti-terrorism law and began a crackdown of arrests
<br>and deportations of illegal immigrants and suspected
<br>terrorists. However, Italy continues to be targeted in
<br>fundamentalist websites, and many Italian officials expect
<br>Italy will be attacked in the near future. They are worried
<br>specifically about a potential attack during either the
<br>February Turin Olympics or the spring elections. We continue
<br>to work closely with the GOI on security preparations and
<br>intelligence sharing for the Olympics as well as on
<br>increasing readiness for possible attacks on USG facilities
<br>or London/Madrid scenarios.
<br>
<br>UN Reform/Iran/Russia/Balkans
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Berlusconi is likely to thank you for U.S. support
<br>in opposing the G-4 plan for UNSC reform; while Italy's
<br>specific concern is blocking Germany from obtaining a seat,
<br>they support our view that any changes to the Security
<br>Council should be based on a wide consensus of support within
<br>the UN. As Iran's largest European trading partner, Italy
<br>remains concerned that it has been excluded from the EU-3
<br>negotiations and complains that the EU-3 has not sufficiently
<br>consulted other EU member states. Italy shares our concern
<br>about proliferation and supports moving the issue to the
<br>UNSC. Overall, however, Italy favors engagement over
<br>confrontation and will be concerned about the economic losses
<br>associated with potential sanctions. Berlusconi and Putin
<br>remain good friends, and Berlusconi continues to insist he
<br>has delivered our messages of concern about Putin's
<br>increasingly anti-democratic actions. Another nudge from the
<br>President would strengthen our message. Italy remains fully
<br>engaged on the Balkans and supports a continued international
<br>presence in Bosnia and Kosovo until there is international
<br>consensus that both entities have made sufficient progress on
<br>democratic reforms. The candidacy of Amb. Laura Mirachian
<br>for the post of the High Representative in Bosnia is of key
<br>interest to the Italians. They have lobbied strongly for USG
<br>support, arguing that Italy's high military profile deserves
<br>an equally strong policy voice. Department and Embassy
<br>officers who have met with Mirachian believe she shares our
<br>outlook for the future of the region. While she has not
<br>received official USG support at this point, the USG does not
<br>want to be seen as opposing her candidacy, since she could
<br>emerge as the front-runner.
<br>
<br>Visa Waiver Program
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) DHS has confirmed that there will be no blanket
<br>waiver, no official policy favoring parole, and no exceptions
<br>to the October 26, 2005 requirement for digitized photos in
<br>passports for any beneficiary of the Visa Waiver Program
<br>(VWP). The GOI plans to issue machine readable passports
<br>with digitized photographs in five Italian Prefectures: Rome,
<br>Milan, Naples, Palermo and Cagliari, with the possibility of
<br>successive extension to other Prefectures. Italians who
<br>obtain passports after October 26 from Prefectures other than
<br>these five offices, or who obtain passports from an Italian
<br>Consulate abroad, will require a U.S. visa. U.S. consular
<br>sections in Italy are working with airlines and travel
<br>agencies to ensure that Italian passengers caught unaware of
<br>the change in visa requirements are directed to the closest
<br>Embassy or Consulate for expeditious visa processing.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) President Ciampi, FM Fini and senior aides to PM
<br>Berlusconi have all raised the VWP issue with the Ambassador,
<br>insisting that the new requirements will be a major
<br>embarrassment to Berlusconi just when he is trying to use his
<br>U.S. connections to improve his election prospects.
<br>Berlusconi may ask the President to intervene to fix the
<br>problem, arguing that Italy is a staunch partner in the war
<br>on terror and is in the process of implementing previously
<br>announced U.S. requirements for biometric passports.
