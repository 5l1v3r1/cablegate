<br>SUBJECT: VENEZUELA: AMERICAN AIRLINES CREW DETAINED AT

<br>
<br>REF: CARACAS 1293
<br>
<br>Classified By: Economic Counselor Darnall Steuart for reasons 1.4
<br>(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The evening of September 30, American Airlines Country
<br>Manager Omar Nottaro (strictly protect throughout) called
<br>Econoff to report that the captain and crew of American
<br>Airlines flight 903 were being held at the airport. He
<br>explained that upon landing a crew member said "Welcome to
<br>Venezuela. Local Chavez time is" X. (NOTE: In December 2007
<br>Venezuela created its own time zone, moving the clock back
<br>half an hour on a permanent basis. The crew member was
<br>likely trying to remind passengers of this and to suggest
<br>they turn their watches back 30 minutes. END NOTE.)
<br>According to Nottaro, a passenger and friend of Venezuelan
<br>National Assemblyman Carlos Echezuria Rodriguez, thought the
<br>crew member had said "loco Chavez time." Nottaro's report of
<br>what the crew said is contradicted by a copy of the
<br>Venezuelan Immigration (ONIDEX) report obtained by a Consular
<br>Section Interpol contact which states the announcement had
<br>instead been, "the hour of the crazy Chavez and his women".
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The passenger, Nestor Maldonado Lanza, told Deputy
<br>Rodriguez who was waiting for him outside, that the pilot had
<br>called President Chavez crazy. The Deputy called Venezuelan
<br>Vice President Carrizales to report the incident. The Vice
<br>President called civil aviation authority (INAC) President
<br>Martinez who went to the airport. The Directorate for
<br>Venezuelan Domestic Intelligence and Prevention, DISIP,
<br>opened an investigation. However, because ONIDEX had not
<br>allowed the crew to go through customs, DISIP backed out of
<br>investigation and turned it over to ONIDEX which had
<br>jurisdiction as the crew had not officially entered
<br>Venezuela. The crew then waited inside the airport for the
<br>results of a meeting between airport, ONIDEX, INAC and
<br>American Airlines staff.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Nottaro stated Deputy Rodriguez demanded to hear the
<br>on-board recordings of in-flight announcements and wanted
<br>each crew member to give a statement. Nottaro was able to
<br>diffuse the situation by promising to put the crew back on
<br>the empty airplane as soon as it was refueled and get the
<br>captain and crew out of the country immediately. Nottaro
<br>also apologized in person to INAC President Martinez and
<br>committed to writing several letters of apology on October 1.
<br>Venezuelan authorities accepted Nottaro's offer and the crew
<br>left Venezuela at 11:30 pm. American made the decision to
<br>turn the plane around even though it meant canceling AA
<br>flight 902 out of Caracas the morning of October 1, at
<br>considerable cost to the airline.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) This is the second incident involving U.S. flight
<br>crews at the Caracas airport in the last month. The first
<br>incident on September 13 involved a Delta flight crew
<br>(reftel). It is yet another example of how heightened
<br>sensitivities are in the bilateral relationship when a chance
<br>remark escalates within minutes to the level of the
<br>Venezuelan Vice Presidency.
