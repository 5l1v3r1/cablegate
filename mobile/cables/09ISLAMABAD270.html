<br>SUBJECT: CODEL BIDEN'S MEETING WITH COAS KAYANI AND ISI
<br>PASHA
<br>
<br>Classified By: Anne W. Patterson, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1.  (S) Summary:  Senators Biden and Graham met with Chief of
<br>Army Staff (COAS) Kayani and Director General of ISI LTGen
<br>Pasha on January 9 to underscore bipartisan support for the
<br>U.S.-Pakistan relationship.  Senator Biden emphasized the
<br>need for the American people to see results soon in
<br>Afghanistan, and he wanted to be sure the U.S. and Pakistan
<br>had the same enemy as we moved forward.  Senator Biden sought
<br>Kayani's views about what kind of Afghanistan would represent
<br>success for Pakistan.
<br>
<br>¶2.  (S) Kayani said the U.S. and Pakistan were on the same
<br>page, but there would be tactical differences.  Cooperation
<br>with U.S. military, with whom he had excellent relations, had
<br>improved.  Kayani stressed the military's support for
<br>Pakistan's civilian government.  He described his campaign in
<br>Bajaur and plans to confront the insurgents in the rest of
<br>the tribal agencies.  Kayani said he urgently needed help for
<br>internally displaced persons (IDPs).  Kayani was candid that
<br>the government has essentially abandoned the Swat valley.
<br>Senator Graham emphasized the need to prosecute the
<br>Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) leaders involved in the Mumbai attacks
<br>and to incorporate the tribal agencies into Pakistan's legal
<br>system.  End summary.
<br>
<br>¶3.  (S) Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE) and Senator Lindsey
<br>Graham (R-SC), accompanied by Ambassador and Senate Foreign
<br>Relations Committee Staff Director Antony Blinken, met with
<br>COAS Kayani and DG ISI Pasha January 9 for ninety minutes.
<br>Senator Biden asked Kayani to describe his view of a stable
<br>Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>¶4.  (S) Senator Graham added his presence emphasized
<br>bipartisan support for Pakistan.  (He had just visited
<br>Pakistan three weeks ago.)  Senator Graham said he was going
<br>to support the Biden-Lugar bill, but he needed to convince
<br>his constituents of the value of investing in schools in
<br>Pakistan instead of South Carolina.  Pakistan needed to
<br>prosecute those involved in the Mumbai attacks and be seen as
<br>a country that observed the rule of law.
<br>
<br>¶5.  (S) Kayani replied that Pakistan and the US had a
<br>convergence of interests.  Kayani's goal was a peaceful,
<br>friendly and stable Afghanistan.  Kayani said he had no
<br>desire to control Afghanistan.  In fact, he said, anyone who
<br>wanted  to control Afghanistan was ignorant of history, since
<br>no one has ever controlled it.  Kayani noted there had been
<br>confusion about the  policy of "strategic depth" but for him
<br>"strategic depth" meant a peaceful Afghanistan "on his back."
<br>But the Pashtuns have to be accommodated, Kayani added.
<br>Biden asked if Kayani made a distinction between the Pashtuns
<br>and the Taliban.  Kayani replied that the Taliban were a
<br>reality, but the Afghan government dominated by the Taliban
<br>had had a negative effect on Pakistan.
<br>
<br>¶6.  (S) Kayani recalled he told Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
<br>Admiral Mullen that the U.S. needed realistic expectations of
<br>what the Pakistani military could achieve and that these
<br>expectations had to be clearly articulated.  Kayani described
<br>his campaign in Bajaur and his plans to confront the
<br>insurgents in other tribal agencies, but he repeatedly said
<br>he had capacity problems, particularly regarding equipment.
<br>Kayani said he needed urgent support for the 150,000 people
<br>displaced from the fighting.  He said the military had
<br>undertaken hundreds of sorties in Bajaur, and the population
<br>of Bajaur was so far supportive of the military efforts.
<br>Senator Graham mentioned the success of the CERP program in
<br>Iraq and Afghanistan which had put money in the hands of
<br>commanders for urgent community needs.
<br>
<br>¶7.  (S) Kayani recounted the situation in Swat in which the
<br>provincial government had made accommodations with the
<br>militants, requiring the army to retake the area repeatedly.
<br>Kayani also said the population, once it saw the army pull
<br>out, was far less likely to support it the second time
<br>around.  The military had to be followed by civilian agencies
<br>or the local support would diminish.
<br>
<br>¶8.  (S) Kayani said military efforts needed the political
<br>support of the civilian government.  He recalled that when
<br>
<br>ISLAMABAD 00000270  002 OF 003
<br>
<br>the Federal Investigative Agency headquarters in Lahore had
<br>been hit by suicide bombers, the citizens of Lahore had
<br>demonstrated against the government rather than against the
<br>suicide bombers.  While the army had sent the message in
<br>Bajaur that it meant business, there had to be follow-up
<br>support from the civilian agencies.  Kayani said as his
<br>campaign moved through the tribal agencies, the army should
<br>ideally need to use diminishing force.  When they have to
<br>fight for the same ground repeatedly, it becomes increasingly
<br>difficult and demoralizing to the troops.
<br>
<br>¶9.  (S) Senator Biden asked Kayani if he had the capacity and
<br>could obtain sufficient resources, would he then move against
<br>Taliban leaders like Baitullah Mehsud, Commander Nazir, and
<br>the Haqqanis?  Senator Biden asked Kayani if he were prepared
<br>to move into the Waziristans.
<br>¶10.  (S) Kayani replied that Bajaur had been the "hardest nut
<br>to crack" militarily:  the Pakistani military had undertaken
<br>an operation in South Waziristan last October, but the army
<br>had moved out because of the elections.  The Pakistani
<br>military had also had a fort in the middle of Waziristan
<br>which had been cut off by militants.  Kayani said he was
<br>painfully aware that the army had to retake South Waziristan
<br>since ninety percent of the suicide bombers came from
<br>Baitullah Mehsud.  "He has to be cut down to size," said
<br>Kayani.
<br>
<br>¶11.  (S) But, Kayani said, the Pakistani military could not
<br>fight everyone at once.  They would have to go after Mehsud
<br>and Nazir sequentially (a point Pasha confirmed).  Biden said
<br>it was important to be in agreement on this issue.  Pasha
<br>said the United States and Pakistan needed to have confidence
<br>in each other.  Pasha said he was hurt about the inference
<br>that he did not have a relationship of trust with CIA.  He
<br>had gone to Washington for a frank talk with CIA Director
<br>Hayden and he often briefed, and sought the advice of, the
<br>RAO Chief in Islamabad.  Senator Biden repeated he was not
<br>going to revisit the past.  Pasha replied that there was no
<br>reason for ISI to be protecting "these people" and he had no
<br>interest in saving them.
<br>
<br>¶12.  (S) Senator Biden said he needed to know that the
<br>situation had changed.  Senator Biden said he understood that
<br>the Pakistani military lacked capacity, but would the
<br>situation change if they had additional resources?  It was
<br>important to know if we had the same enemy:  the U.S. needed
<br>to be able to make an objective assessment of Pakistan's part
<br>of the bargain.
<br>Graham added that "General Musharraf had cut deals, but those
<br>deals didn't work out."
<br>
<br>¶13.  (S) Kayani repeated there had been considerable
<br>cooperation on the technical level with U.S. forces.  But
<br>this did not mean that there would not be differences of
<br>opinion on tactics.  On Afghanistan, Kayani stressed )
<br>"past, present, and future" -- we are on the same page.
<br>
<br>¶14.  (S) Regarding LeT, Kayani said Pakistan would not allow
<br>small groups to dictate state policy.  Pakistan had not
<br>waited for evidence and they had moved immediately.  The
<br>information they had now was based on confessions.  Pakistan
<br>needed Indian cooperation to move the investigation forward.
<br>Kayani also insisted that any information available about
<br>upcoming attacks be shared with Pakistan.  He understood that
<br>information about the attack had been provided to India but
<br>not to Pakistan.  He said repeated discussion about "the next
<br>attack and all bets were off" only provided an incentive for
<br>another attack.  Biden said that what was important was
<br>Pakistan's action against LeT and similar organizations.
<br>Senator Biden said he would share what he had heard with
<br>Admiral Mullen and emphasized the need for results.
<br>
<br>¶15.  (S) General Kayani said he appreciated the Senators'
<br>frank response.  He repeated his need for help with IDPs.
<br>Senator Biden said the system of reimbursement through
<br>Coalition Support Funds would be reexamined.  Kayani said
<br>that the military had only received about $300 million of the
<br>$1 billion ostensibly reimbursed for military expenses.  He
<br>was not implying that the money had been stolen, but had been
<br>used for general budget support.
