<br>SUBJECT: NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR HEUSGEN ON AFGHANISTAN, 
<br>MIDDLE EAST, IRAN, DETAINEES, RUSSIA, NUKES AND BALKANS 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: AMBASSADOR PHILIP D. MURPHY. REASONS: 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY.  Chancellery National Security Advisor 
<br>Christoph Heusgen told EUR A/S Phil Gordon and Ambassador 
<br>Murphy in a November 10 meeting in Berlin that Germany 
<br>strongly preferred that the proposed international conference 
<br>on Afghanistan be held outside the country to make it easier 
<br>to press Karzai to commit to the necessary reforms.  On the 
<br>Middle East, Heusgen thought Netanyahu had to do much more on 
<br>settlements if there was to be any hope of re-starting 
<br>negotiations.  On Iran, Heusgen hoped for some conclusion by 
<br>early next month on whether the diplomatic track was going to 
<br>bear fruit so that this issue could be discussed at the 
<br>December 10 EU Summit.  Heusgen said Germany was ready to 
<br>discuss taking Guantanamo detainees, but stressed the 
<br>importance of dealing directly with the Ministry of Interior 
<br>and keeping the negotiations confidential.  While arguing for 
<br>being rhetorically supportive of the Medvedev European 
<br>Security proposal, Heusgen shared U.S. skepticism about a new 
<br>treaty and an OSCE Summit hosted by Kazakhstan.  Heusgen 
<br>distanced the Chancellery from the proposal to remove all 
<br>remaining tactical nuclear weapons from Germany, stressing 
<br>the need to get reciprocal cuts from the Russians.  Also 
<br>discussed was CFE, the Macedonian name issue and Bosnia.  END 
<br>SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>AFGHANISTAN 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) Heusgen confirmed that Germany would only announce 
<br>additional resources for Afghanistan after the proposed 
<br>international conference, which Chancellor Merkel and UK PM 
<br>Brown are now proposing for January 28 in London.  He said 
<br>the conference is key because this is where the Germans 
<br>expect the Afghan government to make specific commitments to 
<br>improve governance and to gradually begin assuming 
<br>responsibility from the international community.  President 
<br>Karzai had to be put under international pressure to perform 
<br>according to prescribed benchmarks.  Toward that end, the 
<br>Chancellery felt strongly that the conference should be held 
<br>outside of Afghanistan and not on Karzai's "home turf." 
<br>Heusgen complained that the German and U.S. embassies in 
<br>Kabul are on "a different track" and pushing for a conference 
<br>in Kabul.  It was important to "make up our minds" quickly on 
<br>the way ahead.  If the conference slipped to February or 
<br>later, and the UK were no longer able to host it in view of 
<br>the upcoming parliamentary elections there, then Germany 
<br>would be willing to. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Heusgen at first expressed concern that the U.S. would 
<br>undermine international leverage on Karzai by rolling out its 
<br>new strategy and resource commitments before he made any 
<br>reciprocal commitments to reform.  Gordon assured him that 
<br>the formal U.S. roll-out would only come after the November 
<br>19 inauguration, where Karzai is expected to "say the right 
<br>things" in his inaugural address.  Gordon also highlighted 
<br>the need to coordinate on the U.S. roll-out to avoid the 
<br>perception that the U.S. was "Americanizing" the 
<br>international effort in Afghanistan.  It should be announced 
<br>as a common strategy and not as a U.S. strategy to which the 
<br>Allies then respond.  Heusgen agreed in principle, but 
<br>indicated that Germany would stick to its approach of holding 
<br>back on any announcement of new commitments until after the 
<br>international conference. 
<br> 
<br>MIDDLE EAST 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C)  Referring to the Secretary's recent public statements 
<br>on settlements, Heusgen said that Germany "perceives this 
<br>differently" and thought Netanyahu needed "to do more" in 
<br>order bring the Palestinians to the negotiating table.  With 
<br>Palestinians in East Jerusalem getting notices from Israeli 
<br>authorities that their houses will be destroyed, it would be 
<br>"suicide" for President Abbas to move under the current 
<br>circumstances.  Heusgen said he could not fathom why 
<br>Netanyahu did not understand this.  He suggested pressuring 
<br>Netanyahu by linking favorable UNSC treatment of the 
<br>Goldstone Report to Israel committing to a complete stop in 
<br>settlement activity.  Gordon said that making a direct 
<br>linkage between the two would almost certainly be 
<br>counterproductive, but agreed that it was worth pointing out 
<br>to the Israelis that their policy on settlements was making 
<br>it difficult for their friends to hold the line in the UNSC. 
<br>Heusgen said this certainly would be an issue when Netanyahu 
<br>and "half of his cabinet" visit Berlin on November 30 for 
<br>bilateral government consultations. 
<br> 
<br>IRAN 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Heusgen praised the U.S. for its patience with Iran, 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001433  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>but noted that at some point, it would be necessary to move 
<br>to the second track in order to maintain credibility. 
<br>Heusgen said that he and his British counterpart agreed that 
<br>ideally, there would be some conclusion on this by early next 
<br>month so that the way ahead could be discussed by EU leaders 
<br>at their summit on December 10.  Gordon agreed that there had 
<br>to be a time limit, noting that President Obama had given the 
<br>Iranians "by the end of the year" to respond favorably.  He 
<br>also noted that the U.S. could support a Turkish role in the 
<br>proposed exchange of low-enriched uranium for reactor fuel if 
<br>that would make it easier for Iran to accept the deal. 
<br>Gordon indicated, however, that Turkish PM Erdogan needed to 
<br>be careful about losing credibility in Washington if he 
<br>continued to make comments about Ahmadinejad being his 
<br>"friend." 
<br> 
<br>GUANTANAMO DETAINEES 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Heusgen noted that now that the Bundestag election was 
<br>past, Germany was ready to help on detainees, as it had 
<br>promised earlier.  He advised the USG to work directly with 
<br>new Interior Minister de Maiziere, rather than going first to 
<br>MFA and the Chancellery, which had irritated de Maiziere's 
<br>predecessor and made him less willing to cooperate.  In this 
<br>regard, he thought that it would be helpful if DHS Secretary 
<br>Napolitano made direct contact with de Maiziere.  Heusgen 
<br>also suggested that the discussions be kept confidential 
<br>until MOI had come to a decision on which detainees to accept 
<br>and in which state they would be settled.  Premature public 
<br>disclosure could doom the whole initiative.  Heusgen said 
<br>that Uighurs would be "too difficult," but that Germany could 
<br>probably accept "2-3 others."  (Comment: The reluctance about 
<br>Uighurs is due to the expected negative reaction of the 
<br>Chinese government.  End Comment.) 
<br> 
<br>EUROPEAN SECURITY PROPOSAL AND POSSIBLE OSCE SUMMIT 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Heusgen said that while the West should try to react 
<br>positively to whatever the Russians propose in advancing the 
<br>Medvedev European security proposal, nothing should be 
<br>accepted that would undermine current European security 
<br>institutions, including the OSCE.  He shared Gordon's 
<br>misgivings about a proposed treaty.  He was also skeptical 
<br>about the idea of an OSCE Summit in Astana, agreeing that 
<br>Kazakhstan's human rghts record and the lack of substantive 
<br>agenda items made it unattractive.  Heusgen suggested that an 
<br>OSCE Summit be offered to the Russians on the condition they 
<br>solve the frozen conflict in Transnistria, which he said 
<br>Moscow could accomplish "in about a month." 
<br> 
<br>TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) In response to Gordon's question about how the 
<br>government planned to take forward the commitment in the 
<br>coalition agreement to seek the removal of all remaining 
<br>nuclear weapons from Germany, Heusgen distanced the 
<br>Chancellery from the proposal, claiming that this had been 
<br>forced upon them by FM Westerwelle.  Heusgen said that from 
<br>his perspective, it made no sense to unilaterally withdraw 
<br>"the 20" tactical nuclear weapons still in Germany while 
<br>Russia maintains "thousands" of them.  It would only be worth 
<br>it if both sides drew down.  Gordon noted that it was 
<br>important to think through all the potential consequences of 
<br>the German proposal before going forward.  For example, a 
<br>withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Germany and perhaps from 
<br>Belgium and the Netherlands could make it very difficult 
<br>politically for Turkey to maintain its own stockpile, even 
<br>though it was still convinced of the need to do so. 
<br> 
<br>CFE 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) Gordon asked for Heusgen's views on a German CFE paper 
<br>that had been delivered to the State Department just a few 
<br>days earlier.  Heusgen said he did not know anything about 
<br>it, claiming that he did not follow this issue closely or 
<br>"believe in it."  He noted that MFA "loved this disarmament 
<br>business," which was okay, but it had to be balanced or the 
<br>"Russians will sit there and laugh." 
<br> 
<br>MACEDONIAN NAME ISSUE 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Gordon briefed Heusgen on the current state of the 
<br>negotiations, noting that the two key issues were the 
<br>geographic modifier and international usage.  Heusgen noted 
<br>that the Chancellor knew PM Macedonian Gruevski through their 
<br>common membership in the European People's Party and would be 
<br>willing to engage him on this issue if that would be helpful. 
<br> 
<br>BOSNIA 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001433  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Heusgen revealed that Serb President Tadic was coming 
<br>to Berlin the week of November 16 for consultations.  He 
<br>noted that while Tadic always claimed to be tough on 
<br>Republika Srpska PM Dodic, he needed to be tougher.  While 
<br>expressing pessimism about whether it would ever be possible 
<br>to turn Bosnia into a "working state," Heusgen agreed it was 
<br>important to keep trying.
