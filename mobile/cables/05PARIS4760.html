<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Francois Hollande, First Secretary of 
<br>France's deeply fragmented Socialist Party (PS), on June 30 
<br>presented his take on a variety of French, EU and foreign 
<br>policy issues to an informal "Circle of Ambassadors" group, 
<br>attended by Charge. Hollande's analysis impressed 
<br>participants as sound and insightful. His lack of a clear 
<br>program of action to contend with French socio-economic 
<br>difficulties, however, left his audience asking if he is 
<br>capable of projecting himself as a candidate with a clear 
<br>message and a winning program. On display were both 
<br>Hollande's questionable viability as a candidate in the 2007 
<br>elections and the PS's lack of unity and coherent vision. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br>
<br>EU Constitution and the PS 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>¶2. (SBU) France's Socialist Party (PS) hosted, for the first 
<br>time, a "Circle of Ambassadors" group to hear party First 
<br>Secretary Francois Hollande give an overview of key issues 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>and answer participants' questions. While his general 
<br>presentation was unremarkable, Hollande proved more 
<br>insightful in answering questions. Addressing the failed EU 
<br>Constitutional referendum, Hollande noted there were a number 
<br>of reasons for the 'no' outcome, including the need for a 
<br>collective effort earlier in the campaign to better explain 
<br>the content of the treaty. Part of the problem, Hollande 
<br>reasoned, was in the prevailing view of the EU; whereas it 
<br>had previously been seen as a protective institution, issues 
<br>such as the Bolkestein proposal to create a single services 
<br>market and "liberal" (free-market) labor laws have sparked 
<br>fear and concern. Hollande also saw rising nationalism as a 
<br>factor. Rather than seeing the EU as the guarantor of peace 
<br>and stability, citizens are asking what is in it for them. 
<br>Hollande expressed his disappointment in the lack of 
<br>discipline within the PS in support of the Constitution 
<br>adding that just as lack of party discipline had had 
<br>consequences for the future of Europe, it should also have 
<br>consequences for those party members who broke ranks. The 
<br>split within the Socialists over the EU Constitution was a 
<br>key factor in its defeat, according to Hollande. The divide 
<br>legitimized both the PS 'yes' and 'no' camps, as supporters 
<br>of either could point to a PS leader championing their cause. 
<br>Hollande took a swipe at PS no-camp leader Laurent Fabius, 
<br>stating that his support of the 'no' was not based on the 
<br>merits of the Constitution, but on "ulterior motives" -- that 
<br>is, Fabius's ambition to make himself the PS candidate in the 
<br>2007 presidential election. Hollande announced that the PS 
<br>would decide on its candidate for 2007 at the party congress 
<br>in mid-November, and added that party members who, 
<br>afterwards, presented themselves as an alternative candidate 
<br>would be expelled from the party. 
<br>
<br>Future of the EU 
<br>---------------- 
<br>3.. (SBU) All elections within Europe have an EU dimension, 
<br>according to Hollande, who added that domestic and EU policy 
<br>were becoming difficult to separate. Hollande noted that, 
<br>over the medium-to-long term, politics in European countries 
<br>tend towards regular alternation in power between center-left 
<br>and center-right -- which should currently favor the 
<br>center-left, as many European countries (among them France, 
<br>the Netherlands, and Italy) are currently led by the 
<br>center-right. Hollande said that the center-left parties of 
<br>Europe needed to work together and develop a coordinated, 
<br>common approach. Hollande also remarked that Europe was 
<br>facing a crisis of confidence and identity. The French and 
<br>Dutch rejections of the EU Constitution laid bare this crisis 
<br>in Europe and would have the effect of prolonging it. First 
<br>among the concerns was the issue of EU borders. An EU-wide 
<br>debate was necessary to discuss how big the EU should become 
<br>and what its purpose should be. These comments struck many 
<br>as intimating re-consideration by the PS of its position 
<br>favoring Turkey's inclusion in the EU. Hollande also noted 
<br>that the EU shouldn't wait for any new constitutional 
<br>initiatives to secure several essential goals, such as a 
<br>common foreign minister and voting weights and other 
<br>decision-making changes. 
<br>
<br>French Politics and 2007 Presidential Race 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>¶4. (SBU) Hollande asserted that victory in the presidential 
<br>election in 2007 would go to the party that provides 
<br>solutions to the problems of France. If the Socialists can't 
<br>engender confidence, he stated, they risk resorting to 
<br>populism and the "us against them" mentality that showed 
<br>itself during the EU Constitutional debate in the guise of 
<br>the Polish plumber. Hollande stated that reforms in France 
<br>were difficult to effect and often the result of legislation 
<br>imposed by the majority party rather than compromise among 
<br>stakeholders -- a system Hollande characterized as 
<br>ineffective. Hollande cited job creation as a most urgent 
<br>challenge facing France, and pointed out that 70 percent of 
<br>jobs in France are short term or of a fixed duration. (Note. 
<br>This is largely a result of the French employment laws that 
<br>make it inordinately difficult to fire full-time employees. 
<br>End Note.) Hollande observed that the vaunted "French social 
<br>model" (often invoked by President Chirac) was a recent idea, 
<br>and added that he did not know what it meant. The PS, he 
<br>stated, speaks of an EU social model, but the current French 
<br>government touts a model no one wants to follow. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Hollande made several predictions regarding the 
<br>2007 presidential elections, notably that Chirac would not be 
<br>a candidate. Sarkozy would leave the government before the 
<br>elections, likely under protest so he could criticize Chirac 
<br>and Villepin. The Socialists would reunify before 2007, 
<br>unless an opposition candidate rose to challenge the official 
<br>flag-bearer. Hollande foresaw the UMP candidate making the 
<br>second round of elections, with the PS candidate representing 
<br>the left. Ultimately, Hollande reiterated, the winner would 
<br>be the candidate offering the most credible promise of 
<br>change. (Paradoxically, his presentation inspired no such 
<br>impression.) 
<br>
<br>Asia and Africa 
<br>--------------- 
<br>¶6. (SBU) Describing Asia as a dynamic, competitive, and 
<br>important region, Hollande similarly noted that it was 
<br>causing economic unease in France. It was not constructive 
<br>to simply tell people to work harder, he said. Hollande 
<br>stated that regulations were needed to protect economic 
<br>interests, but was careful to underline that he did not 
<br>support protectionism, just the guarantee that all parties 
<br>should play by the same rules. Touching briefly on Africa, 
<br>Hollande remarked that France had a unique responsibility to 
<br>the continent. The EU is seen as the panacea to African 
<br>problems and aid to Africa should be increased, he added. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>¶7. (C) Hollande is right that the next President of France 
<br>is likely to be the candidate who offers the most credible 
<br>promise of change. Hollande, however, seems unlikely to be 
<br>that candidate. Hollande does not project as a leader 
<br>implementing a clear program of action. He has often been 
<br>criticized for his diffidence and lack of "political punch." 
<br>True to that image, he did not demonstrate the confidence or 
<br>talent for galvanizing others to action that voters look for 
<br>in a candidate. His comments on issues focused on general 
<br>diagnoses, not concrete remedies. His vision for the party 
<br>made the Socialists appear adrift. Interestingly, every 
<br>positive example of Socialist leadership that Hollande 
<br>outlined came under Jospin, which raises the question as to 
<br>whether Hollande is preparing Jospin's return, even if 
<br>unconsciously. End Comment.
