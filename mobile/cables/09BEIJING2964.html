<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) SUMMARY: XXXXXXXXXXXX Deputy Secretary Steinberg stressed that the U.S. remains committed to the Six-Party process and to
<br>the verifiable denuclearization of North Korea. The Deputy
<br>Secretary emphasized the importance of continued, close
<br>contact with the XXXXXXXXXXXX on North Korea and stressed that the
<br>U.S. would not compromise its relations with China or other
<br>Six-Party Talks partners in pursuit of bilateral contact with
<br>the DPRK. The Deputy Secretary noted that the U.S. was not
<br>willing make concessions to entice North Korea to abide by
<br>its previous commitments. Ambassador DeTrani assessed that
<br>the DPRK was ready to return to multilateral talks on its
<br>nuclear program, but that it had not made a strategic
<br>decision to abandon nuclear weapons. XXXXXXXXXXXX encouraged the
<br>U.S. to engage in direct contact with the DPRK, which he felt
<br>could spur the DPRK to return to the Six-Party Talks. xxxxx
<br>speculated that DPRK leader Kim Jong-Il's deteriorating
<br>health and his desire to cement a legacy provided an
<br>opportunity for the resolution of the nuclear issue. In
<br>order to protect the gains that had been made and also to
<br>advance the Six-Party Talks, XXXXXXXXXXXX asserted, all parties had
<br>to remain committed to the September 2005 joint statement on
<br>denuclearization. XXXXXXXXXXXX reiterated China's commitment to
<br>implementation of UNSC Resolution 1874 and offered a read-out
<br>following Premier Wen Jiabao's October 4-6 visit to
<br>Pyongyang. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Positive U.S.-China Relations
<br>-----------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Deputy Secretary Steinberg met with XXXXXXXXXXXX for a
<br>fifty-minute discussion on North Korea. XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that
<br>the Deputy Secretary would have an opportunity to meet with a
<br>number of Chinese leaders during his visit, which spoke of
<br>the importance that China attached to its relationship with
<br>the U.S., as well as the respect that Chinese leaders held
<br>for the Deputy Secretary. XXXXXXXXXXXX commented that the Deputy
<br>Secretary's visit occurred on the heels of President Obama
<br>and President Hu's September 22 meeting in New York. The two
<br>Presidents had reached consensus on key issues in the
<br>bilateral relationship, and now it was each side's
<br>responsibility to work together to implement that consensus.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX described himself as an outsider to U.S.-China
<br>relations, and even as an outsider he had met the Deputy
<br>Secretary three times over the past year, a fact that XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>said spoke volumes about the positive development of
<br>U.S.-China relations.
<br>
<br>U.s. Is the missing element
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S)XXXXXXXXXXXX raised "The Red Cliff," a John Woo-directed
<br>
<br>Beijing 00002964 002 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>movie about the Battle of Red Cliffs 1,801 years ago along
<br>the banks of the Yangtze River, as a metaphor for the current
<br>diplomatic situation with North Korea. At that time in
<br>China, three states were in conflict. Two overmatched
<br>southern states had joined forces to fight the
<br>numerically-superior northern state. The two southern states
<br>planned to use fire as a weapon to defeat the northern state,
<br>but in order to do so, the southern states required an
<br>easterly wind. The battle ensued in November, when the
<br>prevailing winds normally came from the west. During the
<br>battle, an easterly wind arrived, which enabled the southern
<br>forces to use fire as a weapon to defeat the superior
<br>northern forces. This story was an aphorism, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>suggested. In the story, the southern forces had all of the
<br>elements in place except for the crucial one -- the east wind
<br>("dong feng"). The same was true with the Six-Party Talks.
<br>There have been positive interactions among the parties to
<br>the Talks, and the U.S. and China saw eye-to-eye on issues.
<br>There was only one missing element: only the U.S. could
<br>bring the east wind, XXXXXXXXXXXX declared.
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX rationale behind high-level visits to dprk
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶6. (S)XXXXXXXXXXXX explained that XXXXXXXXXXXX President
<br>Hu's Special Envoy, and Premier Wen Jiabao would pay a visit
<br>October 4-6. The purpose of these visits was to persuade
<br>North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks. North Korea's
<br>"supreme leader" called all of the shots. China sometimes
<br>had sharp debates with North Korea at the working-level, but
<br>when big matters were raised to the "supreme leader" for a
<br>decision, they were often easier to resolve. That was why
<br>China had sent XXXXXXXXXXXX and would send
<br>Premier Wen to Pyongyang in rapid succession, according to
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX.
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX explained that his visits to Pyongyang had left
<br>him with a clear impression that bilateral contact with the
<br>U.S. was the issue most on the minds of North Korean leaders.
<br>It was possible to revive the Six-Party Talks, but only if
<br>the U.S. would engage North Korea. XXXXXXXXXXXX observed that the U.S. was at times capable of taking diplomatic initiative, and at
<br>other times was cautious in its diplomatic approach. In this
<br>instance, the U.S. had been overly cautious. China hoped the
<br>U.S. would initiate contact with North Korea, which XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>stressed was crucial to re-convening the Six-Party Talks and
<br>to the larger goal of denuclearization of the Korean
<br>Peninsula.
<br>
<br>Chinese assessment of kim jong-il
<br>---------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX allowed that DPRK leader Kim Jong-Il might have some realistic ideas, and stated that Kim Jong-Il wanted to
<br>engage the U.S. soon. Kim had been impressed by President
<br>Clinton's visit, and had come away from his meeting with
<br>President Clinton with an understanding that there were areas
<br>for discussion with the United States. XXXXXXXXXXXX stressed his
<br>personal feeling that if the U.S. made substantive contact
<br>with North Korea, then positive progress on the nuclear issue
<br>was within reach. The U.S. and China should not put off
<br>resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue indefinitely, XXXXXXXXXXXX stressed.
<br>
<br>¶9. (S)XXXXXXXXXXXX stated that he had read a statement after
<br>President Clinton's visit that suggested that Kim Jong-Il was
<br>in good health, and speculated that the medical experts that
<br>accompanied President Clinton to Pyongyang might have arrived
<br>at a different conclusion. XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested that Kim Jong-Il
<br>would like to resolve outstanding issues in the near future
<br>because his health might not permit him to put off decisions
<br>for too long. This dynamic created a favorable moment for
<br>resolving the nuclear issue; it was important for the U.S.
<br>and China to seize this moment and bring North Korea back to
<br>the path of consultations and negotiations, XXXXXXXXXXXX stressed.
<br>
<br>U.s.-prc shared assessment on North Korea
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) The Deputy Secretary expressed appreciation for XXXXXXXXXXXX insights on North Korea and for China's decision to send senior representatives to North Korea to press for the early
<br>resumption of the Six-Party Talks. The U.S. and China shared
<br>
<br>Beijing 00002964 003 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>common goals and a common assessment of the path forward on
<br>North Korea. Both countries had the confidence to send
<br>parallel messages to North Korea, and when we were able to
<br>engage North Korea at high levels, it reinforced shared
<br>U.S.-Chinese objectives. Regarding U.S.-DPRK contacts, the
<br>Deputy Secretary suggested, China already understood from
<br>Ambassador Bosworth's September 3 visit and our ongoing
<br>bilateral contacts that the U.S. was prepared to have direct
<br>contact with North Korea as a way to bring North Korea back
<br>to the Six-Party Talks.
<br>
<br>Learning the right historical lessons
<br>-------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) The Deputy Secretary noted that some people carried
<br>history forward through their own experiences. It was
<br>important that the U.S. and China drew from their shared
<br>history of dealing with North Korea to determine the best way
<br>forward. The Deputy Secretary noted that the chief obstacle
<br>to progress at the end of the Bush Administration had not
<br>been a lack of U.S.-DPRK contact. In fact, the frequency of
<br>direct contact became a source of criticism, with some
<br>observers suggesting that the U.S. had too much direct
<br>contact with North Korea and not enough coordination with
<br>Six-Party partners.
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) The Deputy Secretary observed that North Korea had
<br>established a pattern of provocation followed by conciliation
<br>to ameliorate pressure from the international community
<br>resulting from its actions. It was imperative to break this
<br>pattern, which was counter-productive to shared U.S.-Chinese
<br>goals on North Korea.
<br>
<br>Key elements to current approach
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) The Deputy Secretary asked XXXXXXXXXXXX what missing
<br>element, or "easterly wind," would lead to a change in North
<br>Korea's behavior and produce a different outcome than during
<br>the 1980s and 1990s. The Deputy Secretary offered three
<br>elements that could affect North Korea's decision-making.
<br>
<br>¶14. (S) The first element was the unified position on North
<br>Korea among the Six-Party Talks partners. The U.S. wanted to
<br>ensure that if it proceeded to bilateral contact with North
<br>Korea, such contact would not undermine in any way the strong
<br>unity of approach among Six-Party Talks partners.
<br>
<br>¶15. (S) The second key element was the strong unity of action
<br>among Six-Party Talks partners, particularly in
<br>implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1874. It
<br>would be important for Six-Party Talks participants to
<br>continue full implementation of this resolution, the Deputy
<br>Secretary stressed.
<br>
<br>¶16. (S) The third key element would be to articulate clearly
<br>to North Korea precisely what steps the Six-Party Talks
<br>partners expected the DPRK to take to irreversibly
<br>denuclearize, while also making clear exactly what benefits
<br>the DPRK would derive from such actions. The Deputy
<br>Secretary acknowledged that significant work had already been
<br>undertaken in this regard, but much more work was needed to
<br>establish a specific, common understanding among Six-Party
<br>Talks participants.
<br>
<br>¶17. (S) The Deputy Secretary acknowledged that although he
<br>was not certain whether these three elements would be enough
<br>to convince North Korea at a strategic level to decide it was
<br>better off without nuclear weapons, the U.S. was willing to
<br>test the proposition. The U.S. was prepared to have
<br>bilateral contact with North Korea to determine whether a
<br>different outcome was possible now that the Six-Party Talks
<br>participants held a clear, unified position.
<br>
<br>U.S. Caution on bilateral u.s.-dprk contacts
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶18. (S) The U.S. "caution" in re-engaging with North Korea
<br>stemmed from its interest in ensuring that any contact would
<br>be done on the clear basis that bilateral contact was not
<br>about managing North Korea's nuclear program, but rather
<br>about taking concrete measures to dismantle it, the Deputy
<br>Secretary stated. North Korea had recently sent several
<br>positive signals, including through xxxxx and State
<br>
<br>Beijing 00002964 004 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX meetings, North Korean public comments that
<br>walked back its previous rejection of the Six-Party Talks,
<br>hints that there could be a new formation for international
<br>talks on denuclearization, and statements that North Korea
<br>understood the goal was denuclearization. Premier Wen
<br>Jiabao's October visit would present another opportunity to
<br>convey to North Korea that the Six-Party Talks partners
<br>shared a common position.
<br>
<br>¶19. (S) On the current status of U.S.-DPRK bilateral talks,
<br>the Deputy Secretary explained that there had been exchanges
<br>in recent days through the New York channel on modalities for
<br>bilateral contacts. The U.S. wanted to ensure that if direct
<br>engagement occurred, the DPRK would participate at a high
<br>level. This would be the only way to determine whether North
<br>Korea was serious about engagement. While the U.S. was
<br>prepared to have bilateral contact with North Korea, it was
<br>not willing to engage in extended bilateral negotiations in
<br>which an agreement would be reached outside of the Six-Party
<br>Talks framework. The only way to ensure an effective
<br>solution was to guarantee that all of the Six-Party Talks
<br>partners' interests were brought into play, the Deputy
<br>Secretary said, while also noting that Six-Party Talks
<br>partners' interests were similar, but not identical.
<br>
<br>Key question: kim jong-il's calculus
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶20. (S) The Deputy Secretary suggested that the key questions
<br>concerned Kim Jong-Il's motivations, specifically how he
<br>viewed his interests, and how much emphasis he placed on
<br>reaching a solution to the nuclear issue and normalization of
<br>relations with the U.S. as part of his legacy. The Deputy
<br>Secretary emphasized the need for continued, close dialogue
<br>with China.
<br>
<br>Dprk not clearly committed to denuclearization
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶21. (S) Ambassador DeTrani said that the U.S. assessed,
<br>largely as a result of XXXXXXXXXXXX seemingly successful efforts, that the DPRK was ready to return to multilateral talks on its nuclear program. The U.S. further assessed that North Korea at a strategic level
<br>had not committed to the goal of complete, verifiable,
<br>irreversible denuclearization. North Korea wanted to be
<br>accepted as a nuclear state with ICBM capabilities. The
<br>DPRK's September 3 letter to the UN was indicative of this
<br>point. In the letter, the DPRK acknowledged that it had
<br>reprocessed spent fuel rods and extracted plutonium that was
<br>being weaponized, and after six years of denial, admitted to
<br>possessing a uranium enrichment program. A key question
<br>would be whether North Korea would negotiate while UNSC
<br>Resolution 1874 sanctions were still in place, Ambassador
<br>DeTrani noted.
<br>
<br>¶22. (S) Ambassador DeTrani observed that North Korea had
<br>established a pattern of walking away from negotiations as a
<br>sign of displeasure, such as its 13-month hiatus from the
<br>Six-Party Talks after the U.S. had suggested it possessed an
<br>HEU program and its similarly long absence in protest of
<br>reports of money laundering through a Macau bank (BDA). In
<br>both of these instances, the Six-Party Talks partners had
<br>conceded something, after which the DPRK returned to the
<br>Talks. The U.S. intelligence community assessed that if the
<br>Six-Party Talks partners did not concede something, the DPRK
<br>would be reluctant to move the Six-Party process forward.
<br>Ambassador DeTrani emphasized the shared U.S.-China objective
<br>in achieving progress in the Six-Party Talks building upon
<br>the September 2005 joint statement that XXXXXXXXXXXX was so
<br>instrumental in crafting.
<br>
<br>China committed to 6-party talks, denuclearization
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶23. (S) The Six-Party Talks, on the whole, "have been
<br>positive," XXXXXXXXXXXX declared. XXXXXXXXXXXX recounted that he had told North Korean counterparts on numerous occasions that the
<br>Six-Party Talks enabled the U.S. and North Korea to feel
<br>comfortable with bilateral engagement. China supported
<br>U.S.-DPRK bilateral engagement, and such contact would not
<br>affect U.S.-China relations, XXXXXXXXXXXX assured, allowing that other Six-Party Talks partners might not share the same view.
<br>
<br>
<br>Beijing 00002964 005 of 005
<br>
<br>
<br>¶24. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX affirmed that China was committed to getting
<br>North Korea back to the negotiating table. In order to
<br>protect the gains that had been made and to advance the
<br>Six-Party Talks, all parties had to remain committed to the
<br>September 2005 joint statement on North Korea's
<br>denuclearization. XXXXXXXXXXXX allowed that in light of the
<br>current situation, it might be necessary to refine the
<br>statement, but nonetheless, the September 2005 statement had
<br>to serve as the starting point.
<br>
<br>¶25. (S) On North Korean denuclearization, XXXXXXXXXXXX agreed with the U.S. assessment that it would be difficult to obtain
<br>North Korea's commitment. The U.S. should inform North Korea
<br>that improved U.S.-DPRK relations depended upon verifiable
<br>steps toward denuclearization. XXXXXXXXXXXX agreed with the U.S.
<br>assessment that North Korea had not made a strategic decision
<br>to forego its nuclear weapons program. North Korea was
<br>looking in particular at its relations with the U.S. and was
<br>not moved by Chinese representations of what steps the U.S.
<br>would be willing to take. North Korea often insisted that it
<br>was an independent country and did not like having China as a
<br>go-between with the U.S., according to XXXXXXXXXXXX.
<br>
<br>China urges bilateral, multilateral combination
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---
<br>
<br>¶26. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX proposed that Six-Party Talks partners
<br>consider using bilateral mechanisms within the Six-Party
<br>Talks framework to improve relations with North Korea.
<br>Through a combination of bilateral and multilateral channels,
<br>it might be possible to persuade North Korea to abandon its
<br>nuclear program. Because the opportunity to persuade North
<br>Korea still existed, China would continue making vigorous
<br>efforts in this pursuit. XXXXXXXXXXXX stressed that the Chinese
<br>government was serious about UNSC Resolution 1874
<br>implementation, adding that there had not been any change in
<br>China's policy.
<br>
<br>¶27. (S) The Deputy Secretary agreed with XXXXXXXXXXXX basic
<br>conclusions, expressed appreciation for XXXXXXXXXXXXxxxx leadership on the North Korea issue, and reiterated the U.S. interest in
<br>continued close contact with China. xxxxx offered to
<br>provide a briefing for the U.S. immediately following Premier
<br>Wen Jiabao's October 4-6 visit to Pyongyang.
<br>
<br>¶28. (U) The Deputy Secretary cleared this message.
