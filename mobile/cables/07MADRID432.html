<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Just two months after ETA's December 30 bomb
<br>attack at Madrid's airport set off a bitter debate regarding
<br>the Zapatero Government's handling of the Basque issue,
<br>Zapatero has drawn fresh criticism for allowing a hunger
<br>striking ETA member to serve the remainder of his sentence in
<br>house arrest for "humanitarian" reasons. The prisoner, Jose
<br>Ignacio de Juana Chaos, had served 17 years of a 30-year
<br>sentence for his role in the deaths of 18 individuals in the
<br>1980s, most of them members of the Spanish police and
<br>security forces. However, as he was about to be released in
<br>2005, prosecutors charged him with continued ETA activities
<br>while in prison and eventually won an additional 3-year
<br>conviction against him. De Juana undertook two hunger
<br>strikes, igniting fervor among young Basque radicals and
<br>becoming a central element in the national political debate
<br>on how -- or even whether -- to maintain peace talks with
<br>ETA. Former Minister of Defense Jose Bono told the
<br>Ambassador that the Zapatero Government had determined that
<br>De Juana was truly near death and that his "martyrdom" would
<br>unleash a wave of ETA violence and definitively derail the
<br>Basque peace process. There are rumors that Socialist elder
<br>statesmen are privately critical of the De Juana decision,
<br>even as they voice public support for Zapatero. The
<br>opposition Popular Party (PP) and terrorist victims' groups
<br>reacted with indignation and mass rallies, charging that
<br>Zapatero has given in to ETA blackmail. The Socialist Party
<br>(PSOE) has responded vigorously, asserting that De Juana's
<br>treatment is no different than former President Aznar's
<br>relocation of ETA prisoners to the Basque Region during
<br>Aznar's own attempt to negotiate peace with ETA.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The De Juana decision, along with the Government's
<br>low-key response to the December 30 Barajas airport attack
<br>and apparent willingness to consider allowing ETA's political
<br>front to participate in May municipal elections in the Basque
<br>Region, represent a huge gamble for the Zapatero Government.
<br>Zapatero is betting that the electorate will prefer continued
<br>talks with ETA, even under distasteful circumstances, to a
<br>tough Government reaction that results in renewed ETA
<br>violence. A key element of Zapatero's strategy is to equate
<br>his own overtures to ETA with those undertaken by the PP in
<br>the 1990s. Polls suggest widespread public disgust with De
<br>Juana's release, but this has not translated into greater
<br>political support for the PP. The inability thus far of the
<br>PP to gain traction on this issue may explain why Zapatero
<br>appears willing to place his Government's fortunes in the
<br>hands of ETA and its political allies. End Summary.
<br>
<br>//A NOTORIOUS ETA TERRORIST//
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) De Juana Chaos, a former member of the Basque Regional
<br>Police, became among the most vicious ETA terrorists and a
<br>leader of ETA's feared "Madrid Commando" during the 1980s.
<br>He was captured in January 1987 and was convicted of killing
<br>12 Civil Guards and wounding 58 people in one attack, killing
<br>five Civil Guards in another attack, and killing a Navy
<br>Viceadmiral in a third attack. De Juana is accused of
<br>involvement in as many as seven more deaths as well. In
<br>1989, he was convicted to a total of 2,655 years in prison, a
<br>symbolic punishment since he was convicted under the 1973
<br>Penal Code which allowed for a maximum of 30 years
<br>imprisonment.
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) De Juana became eligible for release in 2005 under
<br>normal penal guidelines allowing prisoners to reduce their
<br>prison terms through "good behavior" and similar benefits.
<br>However, a National Court magistrate blocked De Juana's
<br>release in 2005 by charging him with making "terrorist
<br>threats" in two articles he authored for the radical Basque
<br>daily "Gara" near the end of his prison term. Also, although
<br>many ETA terrorists had benefited from early release programs
<br>during the Gonzalez, Aznar and Zapatero administrations,
<br>Spanish public opinion was strongly against De Juana's
<br>release because of the number of his victims and because he
<br>had never expressed remorse.
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) The new charges triggered a complex legal contest
<br>pitting prosecutors and police against De Juana and ETA
<br>support groups, at a time when the Zapatero Government was
<br>undertaking tenuous peace talks with ETA. In November 2006,
<br>the National Court agreed with the new charges against De
<br>Juana and sentenced him to 12 more years in prison. On
<br>appeal, the Supreme Court in February 2007 partially
<br>overturned his conviction and reduced his sentence to 3 years
<br>in prison for a single count of making terrorist threats.
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000432 002.2 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>This three-year term would have made him eligible for release
<br>in 12 to 18 months (summer 2008), under normal prison
<br>guidelines.
<br>
<br>//DE JUANA BECOMES AN ETA HERO//
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) While the treatment of ETA prisoners, and particularly
<br>their dispersal throughout Spain, has long been a central
<br>issue for ETA negotiators, the De Juana case did not gain
<br>special status until De Juana announced a hunger strike on
<br>August 8 to protest his continued incarceration. Observers
<br>in the Basque Region reported rumors that ETA leaders had
<br>opposed De Juana's hunger strike out of concern that it would
<br>inflame ETA supporters and complicate peace talks with the
<br>Zapatero Government. De Juana abandoned his hunger strike in
<br>October, but initiated a second hunger strike on November 7,
<br>a day after the National Court sentenced him to a further 12
<br>years in prison. His condition reportedly declined despite
<br>forced feeding by doctors, and in early February De Juana's
<br>attorneys released pictures of him appearing emaciated and
<br>attached to IV tubes to keep him hydrated. Between August
<br>and February, De Juana became the most important symbol of
<br>ETA resistance to Madrid, particularly among the young ETA
<br>hardliners who have reportedly taken over the organization
<br>and who were behind the December 30 attack at Barajas Airport
<br>that killed two people.
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) The February 12 decision of the Spanish Supreme Court
<br>to reduce De Juana's sentence from 12 years to 3 years paved
<br>the way for the Zapatero Government to release him. The
<br>reduced final prison term made him eligible for release under
<br>special humanitarian guidelines for prisoners facing
<br>relatively short sentences. On February 28, Minister of
<br>Interior Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba approved the transfer of De
<br>Juana from a Madrid prison hospital to a hospital in San
<br>Sebastian, near De Juana's home, as well as authorizing De
<br>Juana to complete the remainder of his prison term in his
<br>home under police and electronic surveillance once he has
<br>recovered enough to leave the hospital. In a press
<br>conference announcing the Government's decision to ease De
<br>Juana's conditions, Rubalcaba emphasized the Government's
<br>determination that De Juana was near death, or at least on
<br>the point of suffering irreperable physical damage, and that
<br>the Government's decision was made on humanitarian grounds.
<br>Other Government officials defended the decision as
<br>appropriate for an inmate with little more than a year left
<br>in his prison term, also noting that De Juana had expressed
<br>support for the Basque peace process. A judge officially
<br>approved Rubalcaba's decision on March 1 and De Juana arrived
<br>at a San Sebastian hospital the same day to a hero's welcome.
<br>
<br>
<br>//BASQUE EXTREMISTS CHEER VICTORY, PP CONDEMNS RELEASE//
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) An ETA prisoner support group quickly claimed a
<br>political victory for radical Basque nationalists and urged
<br>the release of seven more ETA prisoners who are in poor
<br>health. A representative of ETA political front group
<br>"Batasuna" demanded the immediate release of sick ETA
<br>prisoners and the relocation to the Basque Region of all
<br>other ETA prisoners (a long-standing Batasuna demand). While
<br>some in Batasuna and ETA seem willing to downplay De Juana's
<br>release to avoid embarrassing Zapatero, most ETA supporters
<br>clearly view the hunger strike as an effective weapon in
<br>negotiations with the Government. Several prisoners
<br>(including several common criminals) have announced their own
<br>plans for hunger strikes.
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) The PP and groups representing victims of terrorism
<br>were quick to respond to news of De Juana's release,
<br>denouncing the decision as tantamount to succumbing to ETA
<br>blackmail. A PP youth group staged an unauthorized
<br>demonstration in front of the Ministry of Interior the day De
<br>Juana's release was announced and several "semi-spontaneous"
<br>demonstrations called by victims rights groups have taken
<br>place throughout the country, attracting several thousand
<br>people each. Several demonstrations have been marred by the
<br>participation of far-right Francoist and fascist groups. The
<br>PP is organizing a massive protest march for March 10 (by
<br>coincidence, the eve of third anniversary of the March 11,
<br>2004 Madrid train attacks by Islamist extremists) under the
<br>motto "Spain for Liberty - No More Concessions to ETA."
<br>
<br>//ZAPATERO WALKING A FINE LINE//
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) The Zapatero Government understands that it has
<br>assumed a significant political risk, both in releasing De
<br>Juana and in continuing to seek peace with ETA. Former
<br>Minister of Defense Jose Bono told the Ambassador that the
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000432 003.2 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>Zapatero Government had determined that De Juana was truly
<br>near death and that his "martyrdom" would unleash a wave of
<br>ETA violence and definitively derail the Basque peace
<br>process. While releasing De Juana under pressure was certain
<br>to cost Zapatero political support, Zapatero and the PSOE
<br>reportedly determined that ETA's resurgence would be far
<br>worse, both in terms of human lives and in political
<br>consequences. Though all senior PSOE leaders, past and
<br>present, have expressed public support for Zapatero's
<br>decision on De Juana, Bono and former President Gonzalez were
<br>rumored to be adamantly opposed in private. During his
<br>tenure as MOD, Bono was outspoken in his opposition to Basque
<br>nationalists.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The Government will soon face yet another political
<br>challenge: deciding whether to fight or support the
<br>participation of ETA political group Batasuna in Basque
<br>municipal elections in May. Although many observers
<br>discarded any possibility of Batasuna's participation in
<br>elections after the December 30 airport attack, it now seems
<br>that Zapatero and his advisers are inclined to support
<br>participation by Batasuna, or its candidates running under
<br>another banner. A Batasuna role in Basque elections would be
<br>certain to draw relentless criticism by the PP, and likely
<br>grumbling from within the PSOE as well.
<br>
<br>//POLITICAL KNIVES SHARPENED//
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) While the De Chaos case will be the immediate cause,
<br>the PP hopes its March 10 demonstration will convey
<br>widespread dissatisfaction with Zapatero's ETA/Basque policy
<br>and prove a political liability for the Socialists in the May
<br>27 regional/municipal elections. Various polls conducted
<br>following the announcement of De Juana's release indicate
<br>broad disgust with the decision. In a poll by Spain's second
<br>leading daily, "El Mundo," 63 percent of respondents called
<br>De Juana's release "Bad or Very Bad" and 63 percent
<br>(including 58 percent of self-identified PSOE voters) said
<br>they expected Zapatero's decision would negatively affect the
<br>PSOE in upcoming elections. A separate poll indicated strong
<br>public support (80 percent) for tougher sentencing
<br>guidelines, but tracked with other polls in indicating that
<br>the PSOE would still edge out the PP the general elections
<br>(scheduled to take place by March 2008, but there is
<br>speculations that Zapatero could call elections as early as
<br>November).
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Zapatero and the PSOE are countering PP criticism by
<br>equating the De Juana decision to former President Aznar's
<br>decision to move a number of ETA prisoners to the Basque
<br>Region as part of 1998 negotiations with ETA. The PSOE has
<br>produced two videos detailing Aznar administration overtures
<br>to ETA and calling the current PP attacks hypocritical.
<br>Zapatero has also threatened to divulge previously "secret"
<br>PP dealings with ETA during the Aznar Government, leading PP
<br>figures to threaten to resurface the so-called "GAL Case,"
<br>the PSOE's dirty war against ETA during the Gonzalez
<br>Government. The political environment surrounding these
<br>various ETA issues is likely to become even more volatile
<br>through the May 27 municipal/regional elections, and through
<br>the runup to the national elections in late 2007 or early
<br>¶2008. 
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) As the De Juana episode makes clear, Zapatero is
<br>willing to raise the ante in pursuit of avoiding violence and
<br>furthering the Basque peace process, which he views as the
<br>central legacy of his administration. To a significant
<br>extent, he has placed his political future in ETA's hands.
<br>In fact, many within Zapatero's PSOE ranks privately believe
<br>that these high stakes are unreasonable, particularly in the
<br>wake of the December 30 ETA bombing at Barajas airport.
<br>Nevertheless Zapatero is counting on the PP to fumble the
<br>opportunity and not be able to mount a successful challenge
<br>to the PSOE's leadership in the national elections - as long
<br>as ETA violence is held in check. ETA is doubtlessly aware
<br>that it holds the wildcard in those elections and will
<br>extract whatever concessions it can over the next several
<br>months. However, the Zapatero Government cannot concede on
<br>core ETA demands, such as Basque self determination, and the
<br>key question is whether the Government will be able to do
<br>enough to stave off another ETA blast, with its attendant
<br>political consequences. Thus far, the PP and its leader
<br>Mariano Rajoy have not been able to gain substantial
<br>political momentum beyond their own core base, despite all of
<br>the issues surrounding Zapatero's ETA policy - mainly because
<br>the Spanish public views the PP as too right wing and too
<br>associated with Aznar's perceived mistakes following the
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000432 004.2 OF 004
<br>
<br>
<br>March 11, 2004 terrorist attacks in Madrid.
