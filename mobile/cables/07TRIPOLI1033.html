<br>SUBJECT: QADHAFI'S TRAVEL TO SPAIN
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Chris Stevens, DCM, Embassy Tripoli, Department
<br>of State.
<br>REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Planning for Leader Muammar al-Qadhafi's
<br>upcoming visit to Spain has been complicated by contradictory
<br>GOL requests for meetings and content. After initially saying
<br>the Leader did not want to sign bilateral agreements during his
<br>visit, the GOL has reversed course and the two sides are now
<br>scrambling to finalize language for a host of memoranda and
<br>treaties. The Libyan advance team's requirements for the
<br>Leader's lodging have prompted speculation about his health.
<br>End summary.
<br>
<br>LACK OF CLARITY COMPLICATES PLANNING
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Spanish DCM Rafael-Maria Reig Sanchez told P/E Chief
<br>December 9 that planning for Leader Muammar al-Qadhafi's
<br>mid-December visit to Spain had been problematic in both a
<br>logistical and substantive sense. Qadhafi originally wanted to
<br>visit Spain before the recent EU-African Union Summit in Lisbon;
<br>however, that wound up not being possible for scheduling reasons
<br>on both the Libyan and Spanish sides. It is now expected that
<br>Qadhafi will travel to Spain December 15-18 for a visit
<br>comprising both personal and official elements. Sanchez noted
<br>noted that the GOL has been unclear and at times contradictory
<br>about whether it wishes the visit to be considered official or
<br>unofficial.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Confirming press accounts, Sanchez said Qadhafi will meet
<br>with Spanish PM Zapatero December 17; King Juan Carlos is also
<br>scheduled to host a luncheon in honor of the visiting Libyan
<br>leader. Finalizing protocol arrangements has been "incredibly
<br>difficult", in part because Qadhafi does not encumber an
<br>official position or carry official title, and because the GOL's
<br>advance team -- apparently responding to shifting dictates from
<br>its principal -- continues to change its requests for meetings
<br>and content. Spain's Ambassador to Tripoli, Joaquin
<br>Perez-Villanueva, told the DCM that Qadhafi's plans to visit
<br>Seville and nearby Islamic sites in Cordoba and Grenada have
<br>prompted concern about the nature of the remarks he may deliver
<br>at historic Islamic sites.
<br>
<br>INITIALLY COY, GOL NOW WANTS TO SIGN BEVY OF AGREEMENTS
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) After initially indicating it did not/not want to sign
<br>bilateral agreements during the visit, the GOL indicated late
<br>last week that it wished to quickly finalize language for an
<br>education and culture agreement, a defense cooperation
<br>agreement, a bilateral legal cooperation and extradition treaty,
<br>an investment security agreement and a double taxation-exemption
<br>agreement. Sanchez expressed frustration about the GOL's "wait
<br>and hurry up" approach, noting that Spain had tried for some
<br>time to finalize several of the agreements, but to no avail.
<br>According to Sanchez, the only document for which agreement on
<br>the language had been achieved was the education and culture
<br>agreement. He noted that GOL officials, referencing the recent
<br>denouement of the Bulgarian medics' case, had been particularly
<br>insistent that a bilateral legal cooperation and extradition
<br>treaty should preclude the possibility of immediate pardon for
<br>prisoners returned to their home country. Sanchez lamented that
<br>the rush to finalize agreements for signature in time for
<br>Qadhafi's visit had precluded meaningful bilateral discussions
<br>of what the two sides' understanding of those accords would mean
<br>and how they would be implemented. "The form is more important
<br>to the GOL than the substance", he said.
<br>
<br>LODGING REQUESTS PROMPT SPECULATION ABOUT QADHAFI'S HEALTH
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Sanchez noted that Qadhafi's lodging requirements were
<br>also problematic. GOL officials insisted that the Leader not be
<br>housed above the first floor of the hotel in which he will stay,
<br>saying Qadhafi refuses to ride in elevators because of security
<br>considerations. In addition, GOL minders insisted that the
<br>hotel and room in which Qadhafi will stay should feature as few
<br>stairs as possible. Sanchez said that GOL officials, when
<br>pressed, conceded that Qadhafi has difficulty physically
<br>negotiating stairs (NFI). (Note: Post notes that Qadhafi
<br>appeared to be unwell in television footage of Lisbon's
<br>
<br>TRIPOLI 00001033 002 OF 002
<br>
<br>
<br>EU-African Union Summit. His gait was unsteady and he appeared
<br>to have difficulty turning his head, forcing him to turn his
<br>entire upper torso. There have been recent, unconfirmed reports
<br>that he may have suffered a stroke. End note.)
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Comment: Madrid's frustration with Qadhafi's advance team
<br>and the Leader's vascillating druthers echoe what we've heard
<br>from our French counterparts here regarding trip coordination
<br>for the Paris stop. The focus on securing a raft of bilateral
<br>agreements, regardless of content, is consistent with the GOL's
<br>desire for demonstrable symbols of Libya's re-integration into
<br>the international community. End comment.
