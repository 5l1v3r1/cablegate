<br>SUBJECT: GEORGIA: MISTRAL SALE COULD DESTABILIZE BLACK SEA
<br>
<br>REF: PARIS 1529
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John R. Bass for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C)  Summary and comment.  On November 13 and 16 Foreign
<br>Minister Grigol Vashadze voiced serious concerns about the
<br>potentially destabilizing influence of France's possible sale
<br>of Mistral-class helicopter carrier ships to Russia (reftel)
<br>to DAS Tina Kaidanow and the Ambassador.  As the broker of
<br>the August 2008 ceasefire agreement with which Russia has
<br>still not complied, France would not only provide Russia with
<br>arms that its own officers admit would have helped them in
<br>the war against Georgia, but would send a powerful signal
<br>that NATO and the west are no longer concerned about Russia's
<br>intentions.  At a time when Georgia faces a "silent embargo"
<br>on arms shipments, other countries -- notably Spain and the
<br>Netherlands -- await such a signal to begin their own sales
<br>to Russia.  Such an opening of the floodgates could render an
<br>already out-of-balance military confrontation even more
<br>lopsided, allowing the Russians to assert themselves with
<br>impunity -- and delivering the implicit message that the west
<br>will not interfere.  Vashadze requested that the United
<br>States push back against this sale and said President
<br>Saakashvili would make the same request at more senior
<br>levels.  We recommend doing so, in both Paris and Brussels --
<br>or at the very least seeking a commitment from Russia that
<br>these ships will not be deployed in the Black Sea.  End
<br>summary and comment.
<br>
<br>VASHADZE'S CONCERNS
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Foreign Minister Vashadze raised his concerns with us
<br>about the sale twice, during a November 16 meeting with
<br>Deputy Assistant Secretary Kaidanow and in a November 13
<br>dinner with the Ambassador.  He registered several specific
<br>objections.  First, the fact that it is France considering
<br>the sale carries significant symbolic weight.  President
<br>Sarkozy, representing the French presidency of the EU,
<br>brokered the August 12, 2008 ceasefire agreement between
<br>Georgia and Russia and effectively pledged the EU as the
<br>guarantor of that agreement.  Point 5 of the agreement
<br>requires Russia to withdraw its forces to those positions
<br>held previous to the war -- a provision that Russia has not
<br>complied with.  In fact, Russia has done the opposite,
<br>increasing its military presence in both Abkhazia and South
<br>Ossetia, and expanding its positions beyond their August 6,
<br>2008 positions.  Thus, if France were to approve the sale of
<br>any significant military equipment to Russia, it would
<br>implicitly intimate that the broker of the ceasefire
<br>agreement was satisfied either that Russia had complied with
<br>those commitments, or that the commitments were no longer
<br>binding.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Second, Vashadze noted that the specific ship in
<br>question represents a direct threat not only to Georgia, but
<br>to the entire Black Sea region.  Third, the sale is being
<br>contemplated in the context of what Vashadze called a "silent
<br>embargo" against Georgia, making Georgia's attempts to
<br>rethink its physical security even more difficult.   Russia
<br>would improve substantially its ability to project military
<br>power across the Black Sea littoral.  Finally, Vashadze said
<br>that other countries -- notably Spain and the Netherlands --
<br>were waiting for just such a sale from a major NATO ally to
<br>open the door to their own arms sales to Russia.  A Mistral
<br>sale would thereby open the floodgates to new procurements
<br>Qsale would thereby open the floodgates to new procurements
<br>for Russia -- procurements that could lead to even more
<br>destabilizing steps in the Black Sea region.
<br>
<br>PUBLIC DISCUSSION
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) The newspaper 24 Saati (24 Hours) published a
<br>front-page article November 18, written by a American analyst
<br>based in Tbilisi, that registers strong protest against the
<br>proposed sale.  Calling the sale potentially the "biggest
<br>ever NATO country military supply to Russia," the article
<br>notes that quotes Russian Navy Commander Admiral Vladimir
<br>Vysotskiy as saying in September that "In the conflict in
<br>August last year a ship like that would have allowed the
<br>Black Sea Fleet to accomplish its mission in 40 minutes, not
<br>26 hours, which is how long it took us."
<br>
<br>COMMENT:  THE WRONG SHIP FROM THE WRONG COUNTRY AT THE WRONG
<br>TIME
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Despite reassuring its people that Russia is not
<br>likely to undertake further military action in the near
<br>future, the Georgian Government privately is concerned by the
<br>steady stream of aggressive Russian rhetoric.  The symbolism
<br>of France, the broker of the ceasefire and a major NATO ally,
<br>
<br>TBILISI 00002025  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>taking this particular opportunity to make one of NATO's
<br>biggest sales ever to Russia will not be missed in Moscow or
<br>in Tbilisi.  Not only on the symbolic level is the sale
<br>problematic; this type of ship will give Russia a new
<br>capability to enforce, or threaten to enforce, its will in
<br>the Black Sea.  This sale would render the already difficult
<br>task of getting Russia to comply with its ceasefire
<br>commitments nearly impossible, and it would potentially
<br>increase the militarization of, and instability in, the Black
<br>Sea region.  Although Georgia, despite the introduction of
<br>vastly increased Russian military forces into its territory,
<br>has so far refrained from actively rearming itself, the
<br>acquisition by Russia of such a ship could exacerbate public
<br>fears and virtually force Georgia to seek ways to prepare to
<br>respond.  The United States should take steps to discourage
<br>this sale, i Paris and Brussels, or at the very least impose
<br>appropriate conditions on the sale -- such as firm
<br>commitments from Russia that the ships will not be deployed
<br>in the Black Sea -- that would put any Russian assertions
<br>about overall capabilities, versus their intentions in this
<br>region, to the test.
