<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Key Points: 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- Since your last visit, the U.S. and Egypt initiated a 
<br>senior-level Strategic Dialogue that built upon the improved 
<br>bilateral atmosphere following President Obama's June 2009 speech 
<br>in Cairo. We have seen improved cooperation in multilateral fora, 
<br>in addition to close cooperation on regional issues including 
<br>Arab-Israeli peace and Sudan. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- While the U.S.-Egypt military relationship remains strong, the 
<br>Egyptian military has been resistant to our efforts to adjust its 
<br>focus to reflect new regional and transnational threats. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- While Egyptian leadership continues to view Iran as the greatest 
<br>strategic threat to the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian 
<br>conflict and Sudanese instability are immediate concerns for Egypt. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- Egypt has increased counter smuggling efforts, including the 
<br>construction of a subterranean steel wall along the Egypt-Gaza 
<br>border that has provoked intense domestic and regional criticism of 
<br>perceived complicity in the Israeli blockade of Gaza. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>Renewed Cooperation 
<br>
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Admiral Mullen, welcome back to Egypt. Building upon the 
<br>optimism generated by a new U.S. administration and President 
<br>Obama's well-received June 4 speech in Cairo, we resumed in June 
<br>our Strategic Dialogue and set in place a new framework for regular 
<br>bilateral meetings with the Egyptians to explore areas for 
<br>cooperation and coordination, including examining our respective 
<br>assessments of strategic threats such as Iran. The most recent 
<br>meeting was hosted by Under Secretary Burns in December in 
<br>Washington. We are exploring other ways to translate this sense of 
<br>goodwill into concrete action, including a renewed focus in our 
<br>bilateral assistance programs on human capacity development and 
<br>strengthening Egypt's ability to compete in education, science, and 
<br>technology. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Our goal remains to widen our military cooperation 
<br>discussion beyond the annual flow of Foreign Military Financing 
<br>(FMF). At the end of 2009, we conducted our two premier bilateral 
<br>military events - the annual Military Cooperation Committee (MCC) 
<br>meeting and the Bright Star military exercise. During the MCC, 
<br>Egypt agreed to implement specific measures to improve their 
<br>ability to protect U.S. technology. During Bright Star, the 
<br>Egyptians canceled several joint-operations that would have 
<br>broadened the exercise's scope. We are working hard to ensure that 
<br>Bright Star 2011 will involve full-spectrum operations. Tantawi 
<br>and his senior leaders recognize and appreciate increased 
<br>engagement with the U.S. military, which provides us an opportunity 
<br>to highlight for them the need to sharpen and focus the Egyptian 
<br>military's mission to reflect new regional threats. Egypt's offer 
<br>to train Iraqi and Afghan military officials provides an 
<br>opportunity for the Egyptian military to play a greater role in 
<br>supporting regional security. Egypt also has plans to significantly 
<br>increase its peace-keeping presence in Africa, including a new 
<br>deployment to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and we hope to 
<br>support their efforts through Egypt's inclusion in the Global Peace 
<br>Operations Initiative. We have requested meetings for you with 
<br>President Mubarak, MinDef Field Marshall Tantawi, CoS LTG Anan, and 
<br>EGIS Chief MGen (ret) Soliman. 
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>Regional Security 
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) President Mubarak sees Iran as Egypt's -- and the 
<br>region's -- primary strategic threat. Egypt's already dangerous 
<br>neighborhood, he believes, has only become more so since the fall 
<br>of Saddam, who, as nasty as he was, nevertheless stood as a wall 
<br>against Iran. He now sees Tehran's hand moving with ease throughout 
<br>the region, "from the Gulf to Morocco." The immediate threat to 
<br>Egypt comes from Iranian conspiracies with Hamas (which he sees as 
<br>the "brother" of his own most dangerous internal political threat, 
<br>the Muslim Brotherhood) to stir up unrest in Gaza, but he is also 
<br>concerned about Iranian machinations in Sudan and their efforts to 
<br>create havoc elsewhere in the region, including in Yemen, Lebanon, 
<br>and even the Sinai, via Hezbollah. While Tehran's nuclear threat is 
<br>also a cause for concern, Mubarak is more urgently seized with what 
<br>he sees as the rise of Iranian surrogates (Hamas and Hezbollah) and 
<br>Iranian attempts to dominate the Middle East. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) The Egyptians have stepped up their cooperation with the 
<br>Iraqis considerably, primarily through establishment of a "joint 
<br>committee" which covers the full range of economic, social, 
<br>military and political bilateral development. In November 2009, the 
<br>Egyptians returned an ambassador to Baghdad. MOD is also 
<br>requesting USG approval to sell Iraq 140 M1A1 tanks manufactured in 
<br>Egypt under a co-production agreement. On Afghanistan, the GOE has 
<br>agreed to explore expanding its scope and breadth of programs 
<br>there, including in the areas of education, women's empowerment 
<br>and communications. Egypt has operated a military field hospital 
<br>at Bagram since 2003 with approximately 60 personnel. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Egypt's top priority in Africa is the future of Sudan. 
<br>The GOE would like to maintain Sudanese unity because it believes a 
<br>break-up will increase refugee flows into Egypt and threaten 
<br>Egypt's access to Nile waters. However, the GOE is hedging its 
<br>bets by providing South Sudan with development assistance including 
<br>building and staffing medical clinics, helping to clear aquatic 
<br>plants from the White Nile and building power stations and a 
<br>university. Egypt is the fifth-largest peace keeping contributor in 
<br>the world, with the majority of its troops deployed to southern 
<br>Sudan and Darfur. They have also agreed to deploy a large 
<br>contingent to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Egypt continues to support our efforts to resume 
<br>negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians and maintains a 
<br>regular dialogue with all sides. Egyptian sponsored negotiations on 
<br>Palestinian reconciliation are ongoing. Egypt's objectives are to 
<br>avoid another Gaza crisis while eroding Hamas' power and ultimately 
<br>returning the Palestinian Authority to Gaza. 
<br>

<br>
<br>Mil-Mil Cooperation: Counter Smuggling 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) President Mubarak and military leaders view our 
<br>military assistance program as a cornerstone of our mil-mil 
<br>relationship and consider the USD 1.3 billion in annual FMF as 
<br>untouchable compensation for making peace with Israel. 
<br>Decision-making within MOD rests almost solely with Defense 
<br>Minister Tantawi. In office since 1991, he consistently resists 
<br>change to the level and direction of FMF funding and is therefore 
<br>one of our chief impediments to transforming our security 
<br>relationship. Nevertheless, he retains President Mubarak's 
<br>support. You should encourage Tantawi to place greater emphasis on 
<br>countering asymmetric threats rather than focusing almost 
<br>exclusively on conventional force. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Egypt continues to use a wide range of military, 
<br>security, intelligence, and diplomatic efforts to combat the flow 
<br>of arms to Gaza. The effectiveness of these efforts is difficult to 
<br>assess, and our visibility into these programs is limited. However, 
<br>Egypt has reported success in identifying and intercepting arms 
<br>smuggling networks from Sudan to Cairo, as well as interdicting 
<br>illicit funds destined for Gaza. Israeli officials have also 
<br>reported some satisfaction with increased Egyptian efforts. MOD is 
<br>also participating in a USG-financed project - led by EGIS - to 
<br>install 15 x-ray scanners along the vehicular entrances to the 
<br>Sinai to search for arms and explosives. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Tantawi continues to resist U.S. offers of additional 
<br>counter smuggling assistance. Sovereignty concerns are likely 
<br>driving his hesitation, along with concerns that FMF funds may be 
<br>directed away from more high-profile programs like M1A1 tanks and 
<br>aircraft. You should encourage Tantawi to focus more U.S. 
<br>assistance on border security, especially along the remote 
<br>Egypt-Sudan border. You should also remind Tantawi that no single 
<br>technology can stop smuggling. Success will depend on how well 
<br>Egypt uses all available tools and resources to identity and 
<br>disrupt smuggling networks. He will likely reply that BTADS - 
<br>currently on-hold because of security concerns - and the 
<br>subterranean steel wall MOD has begun to install along the 
<br>Egypt-Gaza border, will provide a sufficient counter-smuggling 
<br>capability. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Tantawi will likely express concerns over releasability 
<br>issues and frustration with Egypt's inability to procure restricted 
<br>weapons systems. However, concerns over Egypt's end-use 
<br>performance, especially in Congress, continue. You should stress 
<br>that decisions to release advanced weapons systems are made on a 
<br>country-by-country basis, but continued cooperation to improve 
<br>Egypt's protection of American technology and signing a CISMOA 
<br>would be welcome steps in our dialogue on releasability. 
<br>

<br>Internal Politics and Economics 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) We continue to promote democratic reform in Egypt, 
<br>including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism, and 
<br>respect for human rights. While Egypt has made some limited gains 
<br>over the last several years, such as on freedom of the press, 
<br>progress overall has been slow. We continue to press the GOE to 
<br>replace the State of Emergency, in place almost continuously since 
<br>1967, with counterterrorism legislation that protects civil 
<br>liberties. Designed to target violent Islamist extremist groups, 
<br>the GOE has also used the Emergency Law to target political 
<br>activity by the Muslim Brotherhood, bloggers and labor 
<br>demonstrators. The Interior Ministry suppresses political 
<br>opposition through arrests, harassment and intimidation. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) The GoE remains skeptical of our role in democracy 
<br>promotion, arguing that any efforts to open up will result in 
<br>empowering the Muslim Brotherhood, which currently holds 86 seats 
<br>-- as independents -- in Egypt's 454-seat parliament. Elections 
<br>for the upper house of the parliament, or the Shura Council, are to 
<br>be held in June 2010 and elections for the lower house of 
<br>parliament or the People's Assembly are now scheduled for October 
<br>¶2010. Presidential elections will be held in 2011. It is still 
<br>unclear whether President Mubarak, in power for over 25 years, will 
<br>decide to run again. Some believe that he is grooming his son, 
<br>Gamal Mubarak, to succeed him as President. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Economic reform is ongoing although Egypt still suffers 
<br>from widespread poverty affecting 35-40% of the population. 
<br>Egyptian-U.S. trade more than doubled between 2005 and 2008, before 
<br>slumping in 2009 amidst the global economic crisis. Bilateral trade 
<br>volume was roughly $7.5 billion in 2009, and the U.S. exports to 
<br>
<br>Egypt more than twice as much as it imports. Egyptian banks 
<br>operate very conservatively and have been spared involvement in 
<br>risky financial products, but the effects of the global economic 
<br>crisis on Egypt are beginning to be felt. As the global credit 
<br>crunch worsens, Egypt remains vulnerable as exports, Suez Canal 
<br>revenues, tourism, and remittances - its largest sources of revenue 
<br>-- are all down and will likely to continue to fall.
