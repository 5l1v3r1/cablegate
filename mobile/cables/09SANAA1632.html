<br>SUBJECT: AQAP LIFTS $500K IN ADEN HEIST?
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Stephen Seche for reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  An armed robbery rocked Aden on August 17,
<br>in part due to the large amount stolen (100 million Yemeni
<br>riyals) and in part due to the belief of government and
<br>non-government sources that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
<br>(AQAP) operatives are the culprits.  The tactics utilized in
<br>the armed robbery bear a striking resemblance to AQAP methods
<br>used in previous attacks, and the sophistication of the
<br>attack discredits claims that ordinary robbers or bank
<br>officials acted alone.  Given the ROYG's lack of
<br>follow-through investigating a similar 1998 armed robbery
<br>attributed to an Islamic extremist group and the potential
<br>for these monies to be used to fund terrorist activities,
<br>this bold, unusual operation, if truly attributable to AQAP,
<br>would provide the organization with a substantial financial
<br>infusion at a time when it is thought to be short of cash.
<br>END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>HIGHLY COORDINATED ATTACK POINTS TO AQAP
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2.  (C) Armed gunmen robbed an Arab Limited Bank truck
<br>carrying 100 million riyals (equivalent to $500,000) in Aden
<br>on August 17 in a highly coordinated attack that many suspect
<br>was the work of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)
<br>operatives.  The armed robbers were disguised as Yemeni
<br>policemen and conducted the robbery in a busy, downtown
<br>district in broad daylight, signaling a high level of
<br>operational sophistication uncommon among average Yemeni
<br>criminals.  After hijacking the bank vehicle and transferring
<br>the money to a get-away car, they erased the serial number of
<br>a third car they used in the operation, which they abandoned
<br>outside Aden in order to delay authorities in tracing its
<br>ownership, according to press reports.
<br>
<br>¶3.  (C) According to independent and official sources, the
<br>precision of the attack and the tactics utilized during the
<br>armed robbery make it unlikely to be the work of ordinary
<br>criminals.  Official government newspaper 26 September noted
<br>that a group of Islamic extremists are suspected to be behind
<br>the plot, though no confirmation of their affiliation or
<br>motives was published.  XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff on August 18, "Al-Qaeda is responsible and I reiterate that the robbed money may be used for terrorist
<br>operations," underscoring the similarity to previous armed
<br>robberies by terrorist groups in the region.  The attackers'
<br>use of police uniforms is reminiscent of al-Qaeda in the
<br>Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) tactics utilized during the attack
<br>on the U.S. Embassy in Sana'a on September 17, 2008.
<br>
<br>¶4.  (C) Rather than attack the bank itself, the robbers
<br>conducted the heist in broad daylight in a busy sector of
<br>Aden, suggesting a high degree of operational sophistication
<br>and access to bank routes and times.  XXXXXXXXXXXX said, "There is
<br>no doubt that there were people who provided them with
<br>information about the amount of money and schedule of the
<br>movement."  Several bank officials have been arrested by ROYG
<br>security forces for possible complicity in the robbery,
<br>according to press reports.  Lieutenant Colonel Haider Haider
<br>of the Political Security Organization in Aden told EmbOff,
<br>"Preliminary reports indicate that there was an insider
<br>involved in this case."  Though no official word has been
<br>issued by the ROYG, Ministry of Defense-owned weekly 26
<br>September noted on August 20 that security forces in Aden had
<br>arrested a group of Islamic extremists they believe were
<br>involved in the robbery.  On August 22 the Yemen Observer, an
<br>English-language weekly owned by the President's secretary,
<br>quoted an anonymous security official claiming that the
<br>Islamic extremists were affiliated with Tariq al-Fadhli,
<br>former pro-Saleh jihadi turned Southern Movement leader.
<br>Interestingly, Free Aden, an anti-ROYG, openly secessionist
<br>web publication, also identified AQAP as the likely
<br>perpetrator but claimed the ROYG was attempting to frame the
<br>Southern Movement by highlighting the fact that the empty
<br>bank vehicle was found in a district of Aden populated by
<br>Southern Movement activists.

<br>
<br>¶5.  (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX highlighted the similarity between the recent
<br>attack and a 1998 armed robbery of a car carrying nine
<br>million Yemeni riyals of government salaries.  The 1998
<br>robbery was conducted by eight men dressed in military
<br>uniforms at a checkpoint where they ordered the vehicle to
<br>pull over, requested paperwork, and then shot two of the
<br>
<br>SANAA 00001632  002 OF 002
<br>
<br>passengers before hijacking the car with the stolen salaries.
<br>After the 1998 incident, the ROYG simply compensated the
<br>government employees whose salaries were stolen without
<br>investigating the robbery, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX.  Though
<br>independent reporters tried to garner updated information
<br>from the ROYG on the whereabouts of the stolen money and the
<br>perpetrators, a follow-up was never published by independent
<br>or government press.  A few weeks after the 1998 robbery, 16
<br>western tourists were kidnapped in Abyan by the Aden-Abyan
<br>Islamic Army, an Islamic extremist group believed to have
<br>cooperated with al-Qaeda in the 2000 USS Cole bombing in
<br>Aden.  (Note.  The group was led by the late Abu al-Hassan
<br>al-Mihdar, who later confessed to the kidnapping and was
<br>summarily executed after a Yemeni court sentenced him and two
<br>of his men to death.  End Note.) XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff that at
<br>the time, the robbery was widely believed by Adenis to have
<br>been carried out to fund the kidnapping operation, and he
<br>believes the same motives could be behind this recent
<br>robbery.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶6.  (C) It is unlikely that ordinary robbers were behind the
<br>August 17 attack, considering the precision of the attack and
<br>the sophisticated tactics used.  The fact that the attackers
<br>conducted a coordinated attack requiring information on the
<br>specific routes and times of the bank vehicle suggests that
<br>they enjoyed good connections and access to sensitive
<br>information, both historical hallmarks of Islamic extremists
<br>in Yemen.  The ROYG's lack of transparency regarding the 1998
<br>armed robbery and its apparent failure to thoroughly
<br>investigate the whereabouts of the stolen monies does not
<br>inspire confidence that the perpetrators of this attack will
<br>be apprehended.  If, in fact, they are affiliated with AQAP,
<br>$500,000 represents a significant influx of cash which could
<br>be used to fund future attacks.  END COMMENT.
