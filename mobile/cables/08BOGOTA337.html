<br>SUBJECT: CJCS ADMIRAL MULLEN'S JANUARY 17 MEETING WITH
<br>PRESIDENT URIBE
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador William R. Brownfield
<br>Reasons: 1.4 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) President Uribe's overwhelming concern during a
<br>January 17 meeting with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
<br>(CJCS) Admiral Michael Mullen, was Hugo Chavez' aggressive
<br>remarks and proposal to grant belligerent status to the FARC.
<br>Uribe insisted the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
<br>(FARC) and National Liberation Army (ELN) must keep their
<br>terrorist designation, and the USG and GOC should work
<br>together to convince Latin American countries that Chavez'
<br>approach would harm Colombia and regional democracy. Uribe
<br>said Chavez has committed to bring down Uribe and his
<br>government by using the FARC as his militia inside Colombia.
<br>The GOC's current plan of action on hostages consists of
<br>locating them, securing areas near the hostage groups, and
<br>calling on the International Committee of the Red Cross
<br>(ICRC) to negotiate their release. Uribe would authorize
<br>Colombian forces to cross into Venezuela to arrest FARC
<br>leaders and bring them to justice in Colombia. End Summary.

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>-------------------------------
<br>Uribe Obsessed By Chavez Blasts
<br>-------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) President Alvaro Uribe arrived late to the meeting,
<br>directly from a discussion with his cabinet on how to respond
<br>to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez' latest inflammatory
<br>remarks, and the show of solidarity by the Venezuelan
<br>Congress on granting "belligerent" status to the FARC. It
<br>was clear that he was still focused on Chavez and the GOC
<br>response.
<br>
<br>-------------------------
<br>GOC Progress, USG Support
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Uribe thanked the United States for its continued
<br>support, stressing its decisiveness in helping Colombia pull
<br>back from the brink of becoming a failed state. While much
<br>work remains, Colombia has made great progress against
<br>terrorists and the GOC feels certain they can win this
<br>battle. Uribe attributed a great portion of the credit for
<br>Colombia's success to the permanent assistance of the USG and
<br>
<br>its armed forces. Chairman Mullen reaffirmed the strength of
<br>the bilateral relationship and assured Uribe of continuing
<br>USG commitment to defeating our common adversaries. He
<br>admired Colombians' determination and leadership. The
<br>Colombian military had transformed itself remarkably and
<br>performed the highest calling possible -- returning Colombia
<br>to its citizens.
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>Chavez' Endorsement of FARC
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Turning to Venezuela, Uribe said his neighbor's
<br>actions cause Colombia great difficulty. The FARC and ELN
<br>must keep their terrorist designation, Uribe insisted, and
<br>there should be negative consequences for any country
<br>granting them belligerent status. It was important to
<br>counter and challenge Chavez' rhetoric, especially on this
<br>point. When France and Mexico granted that status to the
<br>Farabundo Marti Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels in El Salvador
<br>in 1981, Uribe commented, they fought an unelected and brutal
<br>dictatorship. By contrast, the FARC waged war on a duly
<br>elected democracy, they had no public support, and they
<br>financed themselves through narcotrafficking and extortion.
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Asked by the Chairman how much help Chavez gave the
<br>FARC, Uribe replied that Chavez has a five to seven year plan
<br>to advance his Bolivarian agenda in Colombia. He has created
<br>popular militias inside Venezuela (apart from the Armed
<br>Forces) to sustain his revolution. The GOC believes Chavez
<br>thinks he could use the FARC as his militia inside Colombia
<br>to combat its democratic government. Chavez remains
<br>committed to bring down both Uribe and his government, as the
<br>primary obstacles to his Bolivarian expansionist dreams.
<br>With no clear Colombian presidential successor, a well
<br>financed candidate favoring Chavez might find space in 2010.
<br>The best counter to Chavez, in Uribe's view, remains action
<br>-- including use of the military.
<br>
<br>----------------
<br>Regional Support
<br>----------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Uribe urged the GOC and USG to work together to
<br>convince Latin American countries that Chavez' approach to
<br>the FARC was wrong and would harm Colombia and regional
<br>democracy. The USG, he said, ought to lead a public campaign
<br>against Venezuela and counter Chavez' progress through
<br>preferential oil offers. The U.S. and Mexico, supported by
<br>Honduras, Panama, Belize, and Costa Rica (especially Oscar
<br>Arias in the latter) were natural leaders to counter Chavez.
<br>Even Cuba, which felt Chavez had crossed into dangerous
<br>territory, has exercised a restraining influence. When the
<br>GOC asked the Cuban government their views on Chavez' call to
<br>roll back the FARC's terrorist designation, the Cubans stated
<br>that it was "a difficult proposal."
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Uribe saw mixed loyalties among other Latin American
<br>countries. Only Nicaragua had supported Chavez' FARC
<br>proposal. Argentina remains difficult, since Venezuela
<br>bought Argentine bonds and Chavez made campaign contributions
<br>to the new President. Paraguay, in the midst of an election
<br>cycle, is uncertain though the front-runner supports Chavez.
<br>Uruguay, a possible ally, is sitting on the fence. Brazil
<br>remains friendly with Colombia, but prefers neutrality lest
<br>it offend anyone. In Peru, President Alan Garcia concurs
<br>
<br>with the United States and would follow its lead. Chile
<br>remains a good friend to Colombia and its cause.
<br>
<br>-----------------
<br>Hostages and HVTs
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Uribe listed rescue of hostages held by the FARC as
<br>one of his main goals for 2008. He outlined a plan whereby
<br>the military would establish a "cordon sanitaire" around
<br>areas where hostages were held. Then the GOC would
<br>temporarily open the area to outside interlocutors such as
<br>the ICRC to offer an international medical mission and
<br>conduct negotiations. Under this umbrella, the GOC would
<br>focus on the 44 hostages the FARC had identified as
<br>"exchangeable." Chairman Mullen assured USG support for
<br>GOC's efforts, but he cautioned that the USG wanted the
<br>hostages returned alive. Uribe responded with his conviction
<br>that the FARC would not kill hostages at this stage. The
<br>best course of action, he advocated, remains to locate the
<br>hostages, secure the positions, and then call in the ICRC to
<br>negotiate their release.
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Uribe said the GOC also placed a priority on high
<br>value targets and that they had achieved great results in
<br>late 2007. Finally, he said he was prepared to authorize
<br>Colombian forces to cross into Venezuela, arrest FARC
<br>leaders, and bring them to justice in Colombia.
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) CJCS Admiral Mullen cleared this cable.
