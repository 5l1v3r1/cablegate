<br>SUBJECT: VP ABDEL MEHDI TO CODEL VOINOVICH: PATIENCE, PLEASE 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Vice President Adel Abdel Mehdi told CODEL 
<br>Voinovich (Sen. George Voinovich (R-OH), Sen. Lamar Alexander 
<br>(R-TN), Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Sen. David Vitter (R-LA)) 
<br>August 20 that an improved security environment and a change 
<br>in the Sunni "mood" indicate that Iraq is making slow but 
<br>significant progress. In reply to repeated questions about 
<br>the Iraqi Government's inability to effect political 
<br>reconciliation, Abdel Mehdi conceded limited progress but 
<br>cited recent senior-level agreement on the broad outlines of 
<br>de-Ba'athification, amnesty, and detainee release, as well as 
<br>major private sector investment in mobile telephone 
<br>infrastructure as grounds for optimism. The VP stated that 
<br>Iraq has a "Sunni problem" that requires a "Shi'a solution" 
<br>through Shi'a accommodation of Sunni fears and frustrations 
<br>resulting from a loss of political dominance, and that he and 
<br>President Talibani are working together to develop trust 
<br>between Prime Minister al-Maliki and Vice President 
<br>al-Hashemi. He said he shared USG concerns about malign 
<br>Iranian influence in Iraq, stating that the Iran-linked Mahdi 
<br>Army (JAM) was "probably" behind the recent assassinations of 
<br>two southern provincial governors. He claimed that JAM's 
<br>spiritual leader Muqtada al-Sadr has "only 3 percent" of the 
<br>influence wielded by supreme Shi'a prelate Ali al-Sistani 
<br>among Iraq's majority Shi'a population. A recurring meeting 
<br>theme was expression of Senatorial impatience with GOI 
<br>political progress met with Abdel Mehdi's plea for greater 
<br>patience: Senator Voinovich closed the meeting by imploring 
<br>the GOI to come through with a "dramatic" political 
<br>achievement to ensure status quo USG support, while Abdel 
<br>Mehdi asked the USG to not "throw away your past sacrifices" 
<br>through a precipitate change in policy. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Sunni Problem, Shi'a Solution 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) In a 45-minute meeting with CODEL Voinovich, Vice 
<br>President Abdel Mehdi stated that the last few months had 
<br>seen a "shift in Iraq's situation" that went to the "root" of 
<br>its core problem: Sunni fears and frustrations, "whether 
<br>valid or not valid," caused by a loss of political dominance. 
<br>He cited the willingness of Sunni leaders in Anbar province, 
<br>"where all the trouble started," to battle al-Qaeda as 
<br>evidence of that shift, and attributed a change in Sunni 
<br>"mood" to "exhaustion" and a realization by Sunni leaders 
<br>that they had run out of options. Using Northern Ireland as 
<br>an analogy, he averred that insurgencies end when insurgents, 
<br>even if not thoroughly defeated, realize they can not achieve 
<br>their aims through violent means. Abdel Mehdi said he 
<br>detected a changed mood among Iraqis in general, stating that 
<br>"in 2003 we were totally optimistic and in 2006 we were 
<br>totally pessimistic, now we are exhausted and more 
<br>realistic." The 59 year-old Shi'a politician stated that 
<br>Iraq's "Sunni problem" requires a "Shi'a solution" through 
<br>greater Shi'a understanding and accommodation of Sunni fears 
<br>"even though the fears might not be just" but provided no 
<br>details beyond "good governance" and better education. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Abdel Mehdi said that while he and President Talibani 
<br>were working hard to overcome mutual mistrust between Sunni 
<br>VP al-Hashemi and PM Maliki, the concept of power sharing had 
<br>limits "because there can only be two or three top 
<br>positions." He identified lack of trust as a real problem 
<br>among Iraqi politicians, but not within ordinary Iraqi 
<br>society. As a measure of Iraq's growing political maturity, 
<br>he pointed to the contrast between the GOI's inability to 
<br>restrain retaliatory sectarian violence after the February 
<br>2006 bombing of Samara's al-Askari Mosque, and the GOI's far 
<br>more competent handling of the aftermath of a repeat bombing 
<br>of the mosque several months ago that resulted in relatively 
<br>little sectarian mayhem. He also pointed to private sector 
<br>investment of USD 1.25 billion in Iraq's mobile telephone 
<br>industry as evidence that Iraq is moving forward, as it 
<br>indicates investor confidence in Iraq's future. VP Senior 
<br>Advisor Fareed Yasseen chimed in that while the western media 
<br>never tires of stories about Iraq's problems, it pays scant 
<br>attention to Iraqi successes such as the stability of the 
<br>Iraqi Dinar, which he claimed has appreciated against the 
<br>U.S. dollar due to prudent GOI fiscal and budgetary policy. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In reply to repeated questions and expressions of 
<br>American exasperation over the Iraqi Government's inability 
<br>to achieve political reconciliation, Abdel Mehdi conceded 
<br>limited progress but cited recent agreement Iraq's top 
<br>leaders on the broad outlines of de-Ba'athification, amnesty, 
<br>and detainee release. On several occasions he cautioned that 
<br>political reconciliation and Iraq's "radical" transformation 
<br>from dictatorship to democracy will take time: to drive home 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00002838 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>his point, he half-jokingly surmised that there may be some 
<br>people in Tennessee, the home state of Senators Alexander and 
<br>Corker, who have yet to be reconciled to the outcome of the 
<br>American Civil War. He insisted that the Iraqi Government 
<br>should not be held responsible for all of Iraq's problems, 
<br>citing al-Qaeda as "an international problem" and complaining 
<br>of support by Iraq's neighbors for malign internal elements. 
<br>For example, he listed Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt 
<br>as sources of support or foreign fighters for internal Iraqi 
<br>violence, and stated that visiting French Foreign Minister 
<br>Kouchner told him France had detained 42 fighters who were 
<br>headed to Iraq. He also stated that the Iraqi Government was 
<br>fearful that its efforts could "backfire" if it acted too 
<br>hastily. Abdel Mehdi opined that Iraq's enemies believe the 
<br>Iraqi and American governments are "nervous and want to force 
<br>us into making mistakes." A recurring meeting theme was 
<br>expression of Senatorial impatience met with Abdel Mehdi's 
<br>plea for greater patience: Senator Voinovich stated the GOI 
<br>badly needs a "dramatic" political achievement to ensure 
<br>status quo USG support, while Abdel Mehdi asked the USG to 
<br>not "throw away your past sacrifices" through a precipitate 
<br>change in policy. 
<br>
<br>Iran, al-Sadr, al-Sistani 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Abdel Mehdi said he shares American concerns regarding 
<br>Iranian activity in Iraq, adding that the recent 
<br>assassinations of two provincial governors from Iraq's 
<br>southern Shi'a belt (both of whom were affiliated with Abdel 
<br>Mehdi's ISCI/Badr political movement) were "probably" 
<br>perpetrated by the Mahdi Army (JAM). He stated that Iran was 
<br>exploiting some Iraqi Shi'a elements, but declined to express 
<br>an opinion on the extent of Iranian influence over Muqtada 
<br>al-Sadr, JAM's spiritual leader. Recounting an anecdote 
<br>about recent mortar attacks on Baghdad's International Zone 
<br>(where Abdel Mehdi lives and works), he stated that an 
<br>Iranian official told him Iran had pressured al-Sadr 
<br>followers to cease such attacks: Abdel Mehdi said with a 
<br>chuckle that the official's statement unwittingly revealed 
<br>Iranian complicity in the attacks. He claimed that al-Sadr 
<br>has "only 3 percent" of the influence and public prestige 
<br>held by Iraq's supreme Shi'a prelate Ali al-Sistani among 
<br>Iraq's majority Shi'a population, and he hailed al-Sistani's 
<br>efforts to counsel Shi'a calm and peace in the wake of 
<br>repeated provocative violence by Sunnis. Senator Voinovich 
<br>asked him to pass a message of thanks to al-Sistani. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) CODEL Voinovich did not have an opportunity to review 
<br>this message.
