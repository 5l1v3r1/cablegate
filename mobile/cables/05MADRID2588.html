<br>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR'S MEETING WITH MOD BONO
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre; reasons 1.4 (B) and (D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The Ambassador held a successful first
<br>meeting on July 6 with Minister of Defense Jose Bono and CHOD
<br>General Felix Sanz. Bono thanked the Ambassador for the
<br>USG's warm reception during his visit to the U.S. in early
<br>May, particularly during his productive meeting with
<br>Secretary Rumsfeld. Bono said he hoped the Ambassador's
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>arrival would help further the excellent U.S.-Spain defense
<br>relationship. He cited the USG's unimpeded access to the
<br>bases at Rota and Moron as symbols of Spain's commitment to
<br>cooperate with the USG. Bono discussed the upcoming
<br>deployment of Spanish forces to Afghanistan and requested USG
<br>airlift support for this deployment in the form of four USAF
<br>C-17s. He expressed appreciation for the USG's confidence in
<br>authorizing the transfer of Tomahawk missile technology to
<br>Spain. The Ambassador asked about the status of the S-80
<br>submarine weapons system contract. Bono said that Spain had
<br>made a decision "favorable to a U.S. company," but said he
<br>would not announce this decision immediately so that it would
<br>not appear to be a quid pro quo for the Tomahawks. The
<br>Ambassador pressed Bono on the Venezuela weapons sale, making
<br>clear that this was still an issue of contention for the USG.
<br>Bono insisted that the naval vessels and aircraft would be
<br>non-offensive and would probably not be delivered for another
<br>six years, during which time Bono expected Chavez would leave
<br>the scene. Further, Bono said that if Spain found that
<br>Venezuela were "pursuing a path against the principles of
<br>democracy," the GOS would not sell the vessels to Venezuela.
<br>End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Ambassador met with Bono at the Ministry of
<br>Defense, accompanied by DCM, Political Counselor Kathy
<br>Fitzpatrick, DATT Captain Kevin Little, and ODC commander
<br>Captain Carlos Sotomayor. Bono was accompanied by CHOD
<br>General Sanz, Secretary General for Defense Policy Admiral
<br>Francisco Torrente, Army Chief of Staff General Jose Antonio
<br>Garcia Gonzalez, and MOD Chief of Staff Miguel Fernandez
<br>Palacios Martinez. Bono said he was very appreciative of the
<br>USG's warm reception during his early May visit to the U.S.,
<br>which he viewed as a clear signal that U.S.-Spain defense
<br>relations could not be better. He was especially pleased
<br>with his meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld. With the
<br>Ambassador's arrival, Bono said he hoped the excellent
<br>relations would continue at the same level.
<br>//BILATERAL ISSUES - CUBA, 3U COMMERCIAL DISPUTE//
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Bono expressed interest in the Ambassador's Cuban
<br>ancestry. The Ambassador shared his experiences growing up
<br>in Cuba and as an immigrant to the U.S. He said Cuba was
<br>clearly an important issue for the U.S. and Spain, but only
<br>one of many that he would deal with during his tenure in
<br>Madrid. The Ambassador noted that the most important point
<br>on Cuba was that both the U.S. and Spain believed in a free
<br>Cuba that would promote democratic values in the region. He
<br>cited the USG's disagreement with Spain's move to block EU
<br>invitations to national day events, saying that while it
<br>appeared to be a minor issue, it sent the wrong message and
<br>demoralized the opposition.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Bono raised the issue of the U.S. commercial vessel,
<br>the "3U." He said the MFA had requested that the MOD be
<br>prepared to board the 3U since it was conducting operations
<br>in Spanish waters in disregard of Spanish sovereignty. DCM
<br>explained that there was a discrepancy between the USG and
<br>GOS views on this issue, since we believed the 3U was
<br>operating appropriately as a commercial vessel, while the MFA
<br>insisted it was a scientific vessel and required GOS
<br>authorization in order to proceed with its plans to lay cable
<br>through Spanish waters. DCM said that the USG had duly
<br>requested authorization for the 3U through a note verbale,
<br>but that the issue remained in dispute. Bono made clear his
<br>desire that this issue not become a problem in bilateral
<br>defense relations.
<br>
<br>//BONO - SPAIN COMMITTED TO DEFENSE COOPERATION//
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Bono described the USG's unimpeded access to the
<br>Spanish navy base at Rota and the air base at Moron as
<br>indications of Spain's commitment to defense cooperation,
<br>saying the USG essentially could essentially operate from
<br>both bases as if they were its own. Bono raised the issue of
<br>stalled USAFE-Spanish Air Force discussions on Spain's desire
<br>to use some Moron air base ramp space to park its Eurofighter
<br>aircraft, on the understanding that the Spanish aircraft
<br>would vacate the space if the U.S. needed full capacity for
<br>any contingency. The Ambassador said he was aware of the
<br>problem and would travel to Moron the next day to see it for
<br>himself. He said the issue would be dealt with through
<br>appropriate channels.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Bono discussed the upcoming deployment of Spanish
<br>troops to Afghanistan to co-lead the Herat FSB, lead a PRT in
<br>western Afghanistan, and provide additional security for the
<br>parliamentary elections in the fall. Bono said it would be
<br>useful if the USG could provide airlift in the form of four
<br>C-17 aircraft to help transport Spanish forces to the region.
<br>He said media coverage of such assistance would be an
<br>opportunity to showcase the high level of U.S.-Spain defense
<br>cooperation. The Ambassador said we appreciated the value of
<br>promoting such cooperation and would convey his request to
<br>the Department of Defense.
<br>
<br>//THANKS FOR THE TOMAHAWKS, STILL NO S-80 ANNOUNCEMENT//
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Minister Bono said he had received a letter from
<br>Secretary Rumsfeld authorizing the transfer of Tomahawk
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>missile technology to Spain. The Ambassador said Spain
<br>should be proud of that honor, since we had only shared that
<br>technology with two other allies, the UK and The Netherlands.
<br>Bono said he understood this and appreciated the USG's
<br>confidence in Spain.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The Ambassador asked about the status of the S-80
<br>submarine weapons system contract, in which two U.S. firms
<br>are competing with French and German companies. Bono
<br>responded that Spain had essentially made the decision
<br>already and that it would be favorable to a U.S. company.
<br>However, Bono claimed that he wanted to put some distance
<br>between the Tomahawk decision and the Spanish decision on the
<br>S-80 so that the two issues would not appear linked. Also,
<br>Bono said he planned to attend the Bastille Day parade in
<br>Paris on July 14 and did not want to disappoint the French
<br>government, which has pushed hard in support of a French
<br>company on the S-80 contract, before that event.
<br>
<br>//VENEZUELA//
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The Ambassador raised Spanish arms sales to Venezuela,
<br>noting that we understood that Spain had already made the
<br>commitment to transfer the vessels to Venezuela, but that the
<br>USG did not share the Zapatero government's apparent faith in
<br>the Chavez regime to use the weapons for non-offensive use.
<br>Bono said that he had discussed this issue with Secretary
<br>Rumsfeld, noting in that conversation that several countries
<br>sold weapons to Venezuela, including the U.S. Bono asserted
<br>that he had explained the Venezuela arms sale in detail and
<br>believed he had satisfied Secretary Rumsfeld's concerns. The
<br>Ambassador said that, notwithstanding Bono's conversation
<br>with Secretary Rumsfeld, there was still deep concern
<br>regarding this issue at the highest levels of the USG. Bono
<br>said that the media had mischaracterized the nature of the
<br>items being sold to Venezuela, insisting that they would be
<br>non-offensive transport aircraft and coastal patrol vessels.
<br>The Ambassador said the USG would look very skeptically on
<br>any transfer of USG technology to Venezuela as part of this
<br>sale. Bono responded that since the vessels would be built
<br>as coastal patrol ships and not as military vessels, the
<br>would not carry any U.S. technology of concern.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) On Venezuela's political direction and possible role
<br>in undermining regional stability, Bono asserted that Spain
<br>had the same fundamental concerns as the USG. He said that
<br>if Spain determined that the Chavez government was "pursuing
<br>a path that is against the principle of democracy that both
<br>the U.S. and Spain share," the GOS would not sell the weapons
<br>to Venezuela. Bono said that the actual transfer of the
<br>weapons would not take place for six years and he speculated
<br>that it was highly unlikely that Chavez would still be in
<br>power by that time.
