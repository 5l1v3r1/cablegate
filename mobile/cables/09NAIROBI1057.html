<br>SUBJECT: SOMALIA - TFG PRIME MINISTER WORRIED ABOUT RIVAL 
<br>ORGANIZATION, ANXIOUS FOR USG HELP 
<br>
<br>REF: NAIROBI 1037 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Somalia Unit Counselor Bob Patterson. Reasons: 1.4 (b,d 
<br>). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: In a brief Nairobi airport meeting May 
<br>28, TFG Prime Minister Sharmarke worried about the influence 
<br>of rival organization Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama'a and the failure 
<br>of talks in Mogadishu and Addis Ababa to result in an 
<br>agreement to cooperate. Sharmarke confirmed that 
<br>communications and logistics problems had undercut the TFG's 
<br>initially successful counter-attack in Mogadishu on May 22, 
<br>and requested radios and military advice to prevent a 
<br>recurrence of the problems. The Prime Minister repeatedly 
<br>confirmed the TFG's willingness to accept any negative 
<br>publicity that might result from a U.S. military strike on 
<br>terrorists or their training camps in Somalia should such 
<br>strikes occur. The TFG, said Sharmarke, was looking for 
<br>money to pay security force salaries for June. In a 
<br>subsequent meeting with UNPOS Deputy Charles Petrie, the 
<br>Prime Minister asked assistance in getting the Government of 
<br>Iraq to make good on its pledge of USD 5 million in aid to 
<br>his government. The Prime Minister was grateful for the 
<br>Secretary's May 27 telephone call to President Sheikh Sharif, 
<br>which he had listened in on and which "really bolstered our 
<br>spirits." Sharmarke was briefly in Nairobi en route to 
<br>Tripoli at the invitation of Qadhafi. End summary. 
<br>
<br>Lessons of May 22 Counter-Attack 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) During a brief stopover in Nairobi May 28 while en 
<br>route to Libya, a relaxed TFG Prime Minister Omar Sharmarke 
<br>told Somalia Unit officers that his government's troops had 
<br>fared well in the initial stages of their counterattack 
<br>against insurgents in Mogadishu on May 22. After taking 
<br>significant parts of Mogadishu (reftel), TFG troops had been 
<br>forced to retreat, however, when its Uganda-trained 
<br>contingent found itself near the Industrial Road area and far 
<br>in advance of other TFG units. Inaccurate information passed 
<br>by cellphone, the troops' only means of communication, caused 
<br>the Uganda-trained soldiers to believe they had been cut off 
<br>from other TFG soldiers, and they beat a hasty retreat, 
<br>Sharmarke said. The May 22 counteroffensive, although 
<br>ultimately unsuccessful, showed that security force their 
<br>considerable weaknesses: communications, logistics, and 
<br>battlefield command. Sharmarke requested USG assistance in 
<br>procuring walkie talkies and other battlefield communications 
<br>equipment and any training that could be provided the TFG's 
<br>field commanders. He welcome the suggestion that experienced 
<br>Rwandan or Ugandan trainers be detailed, if possible, to 
<br>Mogadishu to lead intensive courses. 
<br>
<br>Praise for IGAD Communique 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Sharmarke was philosophical about progress al-Shabaab 
<br>and other insurgents had made against the TFG in recent 
<br>weeks. The TFG, he maintained, was keeping the door open to 
<br>"reasonable guys," while al-Shabaab's reliance on foreigners 
<br>was costing it support among Somalis. Sharmarke praised the 
<br>May 20 IGAD ministerial communique's call for control of 
<br>Somali airports and ports, and alleged that it had triggered 
<br>al-Shabaab's efforts, via incursions into Medina to win 
<br>control of Mogadishu airport. 
<br>
<br>Foreigners Fighting 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Sharmarke joined other Somalis in alleging 
<br>significant foreign involvement in al-Shabaab's efforts. A 
<br>"Pakistani general" was coordinating the attacks on the TFG 
<br>in Mogadishu, he said. Also present was an alleged al-Qaida 
<br>operative he was able to identify only as "al-Libi." 
<br>Sharmarke noted that he was keeping indirect tabs on Muhtar 
<br>Robow, but no one in the TFG, to his knowledge, had had 
<br>contact since Robow's resignation as al-Shabaab spokesman. 
<br>Sharmarke described considerable stress between Hisbul Islam 
<br>and al-Shabaab, with Hassan Dahir Aweys allegedly "shocked" 
<br>by al-Shabaab's "lack of a strategy other than fighting." 
<br>
<br>ASWJ Negotiations Faltering 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The TFG's negotiations with Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama'a 
<br>(ASWJ) had produced no results to date, according to 
<br>Sharmarke. He described the Somalia central region 
<br>
<br>NAIROBI 00001057 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>representatives they had been in contact with as "determined 
<br>to make gains quickly on the ground," so that those gains 
<br>could be parlayed into an improved negotiating position with 
<br>the TFG. Although the TFG had provided some money to ASWJ, 
<br>all assistance was now stalled, with some in the TFG worried 
<br>that TFG cash was feeding a potential rival. ASWJ continued 
<br>to push for high-profile ministerial positions and to stall 
<br>on active cooperation with the TFG. Sharmarke was not 
<br>certain what pressure the Government of Ethiopia could exert 
<br>on ASWJ, but he several times urged the USG to do what it 
<br>could to bring ASWJ around. 
<br>
<br>Money Needs 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The Prime Minister promised an accounting shortly of 
<br>the USD 500 thousand provided by the USG. He as very grateful 
<br>for USG efforts to supply TFG forces with larger-caliber 
<br>ammunition and weapons. The TFG had subsidized allies in 
<br>Hiraan and Jowhar, as well as having provided stipends to an 
<br>unspecified number of "al-Shabaab defectors." His government 
<br>believed it was safer if the technicals that belonged to 
<br>mercurial warlords Mohammed Dheere and Indha Adde were safely 
<br>in TFG control, and negotiations were now under way to that 
<br>end. Sharmarke estimated the total number of technicals at 
<br>18, in addition to one APC. He noted that their purchase 
<br>would place significant additional strain on the TFG's 
<br>finances and asked continued USG support. (In a subsequent 
<br>brief conversation with UNPOS Deputy Charles Petrie, 
<br>Sharmarke urged UN and USG intercession with Iraq to speed 
<br>the delivery of an alleged USD 5 million that the Baghdad 
<br>government had pledged to the TFG.) 
<br>
<br>Support for Kinetic Strikes 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Sharmarke recalled that he had called Somalia Unit 
<br>on May 16 to urge that the USG "take out" if possible 
<br>participants in an al-Shabaab - Hisbul Islam conclave near 
<br>Afgoye. That phone call, he re-affirmed, had been made with 
<br>the express consent of President Sheikh Sharif, who also 
<br>believed with Sharmarke that and USG strikes on known 
<br>terrorists or their training camps was necessary. Asked if 
<br>the TFG could weather the fallout from such a strike or 
<br>strikes and their potential collateral damage Sharmarke, 
<br>without hesitation said, "yes." "These people," he said, "are 
<br>out to destroy our way of life." 
<br>
<br>Travel Plans 
<br>------------ 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Sharmarke was en route to Libya at the invitation of 
<br>Qadhafi and in place of President Sharif, whom Ambassador 
<br>Ranneberger, in a May 26 telephone call, had strongly 
<br>discouraged from leaving Mogadishu during this stressful time. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Sharmarke, like President Sharif in our recent 
<br>telephone contacts with him, was calm and convinced that the 
<br>TFG could prevail against its enemies. He philosophically 
<br>acknowledged the many basic problems confronting his 
<br>government, from forging an alliance with ASWJ to ironing out 
<br>command and control and logistical problems in its fragile 
<br>security forces. His dismissive comments about al-Shabaab's 
<br>reported increasing reliance on foreign fighters, ironically, 
<br>mirror al-Shabaab's accusations that the TFG is over-reliant 
<br>on the foreign fighters of AMISOM as it haltingly tries to 
<br>increase its hold on Mogadishu.
