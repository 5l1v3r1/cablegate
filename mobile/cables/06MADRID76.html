<br>SUBJECT: SPAIN/VENEZUELA: REACTION TO DENIAL OF LICENSE FOR
<br>TECH TRANSFER
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 5253
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Bob Manzanares; reasons 1.4 (B) and (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The Ambassador met with Foreign Minister
<br>Miguel Angel Moratinos on January 12 to advise him of the USG
<br>decision to deny the Spanish technology transfer license
<br>request related to the sale of Spanish aircraft to the
<br>Venezuelan government. Moratinos expressed frustration,
<br>saying it would be seen as a "punitive action" by the USG
<br>against Spain and would provide a field day for the
<br>opposition and the media. He said he expected a negative
<br>reaction by President Zapatero to the news. Moratinos
<br>complained that the USG did not recognize Spain's positive
<br>steps, but only focused on negative episodes in the
<br>relationship; he urged a clear "positive signal" that the USG
<br>wanted good relations with Spain. The Ambassador reviewed
<br>the USG's clear, consistent, and frequent messages to Spain
<br>regarding its sale of ships and planes to Venezuela. He said
<br>the USG also desired better relations and had made a
<br>concerted effort to work with Spain in Latin America, as
<br>evidenced by the upcoming visit of WHA A/S Shannon. The
<br>Ambassador met briefly with President Zapatero and Moratinos
<br>at a representational event later in the day; both appeared
<br>to have accepted the news and were focused on how to deal
<br>with it in the media. Comment: It would be useful from
<br>Embassy Madrid's perspective to again demonstrate our
<br>interest in good relations with Spain, perhaps by arranging a
<br>meeting for Moratinos with the Secretary when Moratinos is in
<br>the U.S. in May for the U.S.-Spain Council meeting in
<br>Florida. End Comment.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Separately, Moratinos discussed his impressions of
<br>Bolivian president-elect Evo Morales, describing him as
<br>honest, but inexperienced and caught in "a bear hug" by
<br>Castro and Chavez. He said he had encouraged Morales to work
<br>with the USG. For his part Morales asked that Spain convey
<br>two messages to the USG: A) that the USG not imply that he is
<br>connected to narcotraffickers (or by association with
<br>terrorists) because of his support for the coca growers, and
<br>B) that the USG give Morales "room for maneuver" with the IMF
<br>and World Bank. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The Ambassador, accompanied by DCM, relayed reftel
<br>points to FM Moratinos and Deputy FM Bernardino Leon, telling
<br>Moratinos that it was not the USG's intent to make the denial
<br>of the licenses public. The Ambassador explained that the
<br>USG had carefully reviewed the application for a license by
<br>EADS CASA and was denying the application consistent with USG
<br>concerns regarding the transfer of such technology to
<br>Venezuela, not as a swipe against the Spanish government. He
<br>told Moratinos that he would similarly inform Minister of
<br>Defense Jose Bono and EADS CASA Chairman Sanz.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Moratinos asked whether the USG decision could be
<br>reversed. The Ambassador said that it was a firm decision
<br>that could only be revisited if Venezuela changed its present
<br>course, noting that the USG was following the same policy
<br>with respect to similar applications by other countries for
<br>authorization to transfer technology to Venezuela, as we had
<br>recently explained to Spanish officials. Moratinos said the
<br>denial of the applications was unfortunate, given the Spanish
<br>government's approval to EADS CASA to continue with the sale
<br>and expressed concern about how this decision would affect
<br>Spanish commercial interests. The Ambassador ventured that
<br>EADS CASA would probably not be unduly harmed, given the
<br>company's significant business interests elsewhere, but that
<br>that issue was for the company to resolve.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Moratinos turned to the political impact of the USG
<br>decision, saying it would be portrayed as a punitive action
<br>by the USG against the Zapatero government and would give the
<br>opposition and the media platform to cast Zapatero as inept
<br>in his handling of relations with the U.S. Moratinos said he
<br>would inform Zapatero immediately and expected him to react
<br>negatively to the news. He said he would inform the
<br>Ambassador of Zapatero's reaction.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In a frustrated tone, Moratinos asked what the USG
<br>expected of Spain. He said 2006 was a crucial year for the
<br>Zapatero government and that they had to get bilateral
<br>relations on track because the U.S. would be absorbed by
<br>political campaigning in 2007. Moratinos said Spain desired
<br>"clear signals" from the USG that bilateral relations had
<br>improved, but saw only "punitive signals," including this
<br>decision to deny the technology transfer to Venezuela. He
<br>said the USG and Spain should be establishing joint
<br>objectives in democracy promotion in Venezuela rather than
<br>arguing over arms sales. "We are the eighth largest power in
<br>the world, but (the USG) treats us like a fifth-rate power.
<br>We have no indication that there could be a visit by
<br>Secretary Rice or other high level attention. We want to
<br>
<br>SIPDIS
<br>work with you, but need a minimal political signal that you
<br>want to work with us. We need to demonstrate that the
<br>bilateral relations are on track and are not just about what
<br>we are doing in Venezuela and Cuba."
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The Ambassador responded that there could be no
<br>surprise on the part of Moratinos or other Spanish leaders
<br>regarding the USG's decision on the EADS CASA application.
<br>From the beginning, the USG message on the Spanish sales to
<br>Venezuela had been clear, consistent, and frequent. Spain
<br>had made its decision in spite of our objections.
<br>Nevertheless, said the Ambassador, the USG also wished to put
<br>this issue behind us and move forward on a common agenda, as
<br>evidenced by the upcoming visits of WHA A/S Tom Shannon and
<br>Senator Mel Martinez. He also noted Spanish Vice President
<br>de la Vega's expression of interest in visiting the U.S.,
<br>which the Embassy supported. The Ambassador said he agreed
<br>with Moratinos that we could work together to make 2006 a
<br>good year for the bilateral relationship. At this point,
<br>Deputy FM Leon noted that former President Felipe Gonzalez
<br>planned to visit Venezuela at the end of January to talk to
<br>both Chavez and the opposition as part of Spain's democracy
<br>promotion efforts.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Hours later, the Ambassador met with President
<br>Zapatero and Moratinos in an informal pull-aside at a Royal
<br>Palace reception. They seemed to have digested the news well
<br>and were focused on media portrayal of the decision. The
<br>Ambassador assured them that the USG was not interested in a
<br>negative portrayal of this episode in the media viz-a-viz
<br>U.S.-Spain bilateral relations.
<br>
<br>//EVO MORALES VISIT//
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) On the visit of Bolivian president-elect Evo Morales,
<br>Moratinos shared his impression that Morales' strengths were
<br>his "honesty and his conscience." However, Moratinos also
<br>described Morales as uninformed and inexperienced. Morales
<br>told Spanish interlocutors that he desired a special
<br>relationship with Spain and did not want to rely solely on
<br>Venezuela and Cuba, but Moratinos expressed concern that
<br>Castro and Chavez' "bear hug" of Morales would continue to
<br>have a negative effect. Moratinos said he had urged Morales
<br>to stop aggravating the USG. According to Moratinos, Morales
<br>asked that Spain convey two messages to the USG on his behalf:
<br>
<br>-- Do not implicate him with narcotics trafficking (or by
<br>extension narco terrorism) simply because of his support for
<br>coca cultivation; and,
<br>
<br>-- Give him room for manuever with the IMF and the World Bank.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Given President Zapatero's measured response, it
<br>appears that Moratinos overcame his frustration and presented
<br>the issue to Zapatero is a straightforward manner. Overall,
<br>Moratinos has been a positive influence throughout this
<br>episode, despite having to (again) play the role of the loser
<br>in an internal struggle with Bono. Moratinos consistently
<br>scores near the bottom in Spanish public opinion polls while
<br>Bono is among the most popular figures in the cabinet. This
<br>may be due in part to the fact that Bono is a professional
<br>politician, while Moratinos is a career diplomat with little
<br>flair for the spotlight. From our viewpoint, it makes sense
<br>to reinforce Moratinos' positive attitudes, perhaps through a
<br>meeting with the Secretary during Moratinos' visit to the
<br>U.S. in May to participate in the U.S.-Spain Council meetings
<br>in Florida.
