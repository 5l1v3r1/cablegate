<br>-------
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Former Ecuadorian president Lucio Gutierrez told
<br>poloffs October 5 that he intends to return to Ecuador,
<br>perhaps within weeks, and expects to be jailed on his
<br>arrival. Gutierrez said he wants to run for president in
<br>2006 and would like the U.S. to ensure that his life is
<br>protected while in jail and that any charges against him be
<br>tried fairly. His former foreign minister, Patricio
<br>Zuquilanda, hopes to travel to the U.S. mid-October to brief
<br>the USG on Gutierrez's plans. End summary.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------
<br>Gutierrez to Return to Ecuador Soon, Plans Presidential Bid
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Former Ecuadorian president Lucio Gutierrez told
<br>poloffs at a lunch October 5 that he would return to Ecuador
<br>"as soon as possible" and expects to be arrested and
<br>imprisoned. "I am prepared to spend two, three, four months
<br>in jail to clear my name," he said. According to Gutierrez,
<br>the GOE has "persecuted" him and his family. The GOE would
<br>not be able to prove any charges against him, he predicted.
<br>Gutierrez said he would go back "shortly" after a book launch
<br>in Bogota October 12. Gutierrez, who was accompanied by his
<br>former foreign minister Patricio Zuquilanda at the lunch
<br>hosted by prominent Colombian political figure/businessman
<br>David Turbay, said he intended to run for president in
<br>October 2006. He claimed that public and private polls
<br>suggest he has a solid chance of victory if allowed to run.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) Gutierrez said he expected the Ecuadorian media to
<br>oppose his presidential bid, but with a less partisan tone
<br>than that which he claimed they displayed during his tenure.
<br>Both Gutierrez and Zuquilanda said the Ecuadorian media felt
<br>somewhat chastened by their role in the events that led to
<br>Gutierrez fleeing the country in April 2005. Gutierrez
<br>acknowledged that he has few funds to mount a TV campaign and
<br>suggested that he would instead run a "people's campaign"
<br>that relied on personal meetings and rallies, although he
<br>implied that unnamed companies in Ecuador would supply funds
<br>as well.
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>Free Speech and Political Asylum Conditions
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Gutierrez acknowledged that he faced certain
<br>restrictions on his conduct and speech while in Colombia as a
<br>result of the GOC's October 4 decision to grant his request
<br>for political asylum. Gutierrez said he is not supposed to
<br>comment on internal Colombian or Ecuadorian politics, or do
<br>or say anything that would negatively affect
<br>Colombian-Ecuadorian relations. He argued, however, that his
<br>planned October 12 book launch was an attempt to "set the
<br>record straight" on factual matters relating to his fall from
<br>power. He also said he would respond to any questions posed
<br>by journalists; "I still have the right to free speech," he
<br>said.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------
<br>Chavez is Threat to Entire World
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Gutierrez and, especially, Zuquilanda, spent
<br>considerable time denouncing Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez
<br>as a threat to "the entire world, not just South America."
<br>"We must unite as friends to combat Chavez," Zuquilanda said
<br>on several occasions. Zuquilanda described a 2004 Cabinet
<br>meeting at which the GOE Defense Minister informed the
<br>Cabinet that the Venezuelan ambassador in Quito was using his
<br>embassy to fund travel to and training in Venezuela for
<br>Ecuadorian radicals, whose objective was "Marxist revolution"
<br>in Ecuador. Zuquilanda said he called the ambassador in and
<br>told him he had in his desk a diplomatic note declaring the
<br>ambassador persona non grata unless he clarified the matter.
<br>Zuquilanda said the ambassador attempted weak explanations,
<br>then mumbled apologies, without denying the accusations. The
<br>ambassador said he would ensure nothing like it ever happened
<br>again.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>Gutierrez Claims Ecuador Heading in Anti-U.S. Direction
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Gutierrez and Zuquilanda said that Ecuadorian
<br>president Palacio intended to close down the U.S. FOL at
<br>Manta. If this happened, Zuquilanda said, it would be a
<br>"disaster" for the Manta economy. In Gutierrez's view,
<br>Economy Minister Rafael Correa is strongly anti-American and
<br>intends to run for president in 2006 an on a populist
<br>platform that would "target American interests." Both said
<br>that anti-American sentiment had increased in Ecuador in
<br>recent years and argued that the U.S. should "massively"
<br>increase public affairs efforts.
<br>
<br>---------------------
<br>FARC Bases in Ecuador
<br>---------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) Gutierrez said "of course" the FARC has bases in
<br>Ecuador, but he said that when he was president he tried to
<br>attack them when discovered. Gutierrez said the 600km-plus
<br>border with Colombia makes it tough to police; "how can you
<br>tell who is and who is not FARC if they all wear civilian
<br>clothes?" he noted.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>Former Foreign Minister Plans U.S. Travel
<br>-----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Zuquilanda said he wanted to travel to the U.S.
<br>during the second or third week of October to brief USG
<br>officials on Gutierrez's plans. When asked if that travel
<br>proposal meant that he would not return to Ecuador until
<br>Zuquilanda returned, Gutierrez said, "no, I want to go back
<br>as soon as possible."
<br>
<br>-------
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) Gutierrez seemed calm and did not appear concerned
<br>about being jailed, a prospect he clearly believes is likely.
<br>He did not ask for any U.S. assistance, except to ensure
<br>that the GOE protected him while in jail and, if possible,
<br>ensure that any charges against him were tried on the merits.
<br>Zuquilanda was considerably more "political" in his
<br>comments, evidently trying to persuade the U.S. that the
<br>Gutierrez/Zuquilanda combination would be a strong U.S ally
<br>in combating Chavez and the FARC.
