<br> 
<br>------- 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S//REL SAU) During the week of 13 October and in 
<br>response to ISN Acting Assistant Secretary Patricia 
<br>McNerney's encouragement to help increase pressure on Iran to 
<br>change course, Saudi MFA Undersecretary for Multilateral 
<br>Affairs, Prince Turki Bin Mohamed Bin Saud Al-Kabeer 
<br>requested U.S. recommendations on specific actions Saudi 
<br>Arabia could take (REF A).  Washington would like to provide 
<br>the following non-paper to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), 
<br>which contains suggestions on how to further enhance Saudi 
<br>Arabia,s non-proliferation efforts with regard to Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  On October 16, 2008, the Financial Action Task Force 
<br>(FATF) issued its fourth warning of the serious threat posed 
<br>by Iran's lack of a sufficient anti-money laundering and 
<br>counterterrorist financing regime (REF B). During the same 
<br>plenary meeting, FATF also separately issued guidance on the 
<br>steps that countries should take to implement UNSCR 1803's 
<br>call for vigilance over the activities of financial 
<br>institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled in 
<br>Iran, in order to avoid such activities contributing to 
<br>proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or to the 
<br>development of nuclear weapon delivery systems.  These two 
<br>actions by the FATF, combined with the already widely held 
<br>view that Iranian financial institutions play a key role in 
<br>Iran's proliferation efforts, merit immediate action by 
<br>countries to mitigate these illicit finance risks. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>---------- 
<br>OBJECTIVES 
<br>---------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S//REL SAU) Washington requests Embassy Riyadh approach 
<br>Prince Turki, or other appropriate senior KSA officials, to 
<br>discuss this issue and provide U.S. recommendations.  Post 
<br>should pursue the following objectives: 
<br> 
<br>-- Present the non-paper at paragraph 5 to KSA officials. 
<br> 
<br>-- Urge host government to issue a public statement that 
<br>advances the October 2008 FATF statement on Iran, and 
<br>encourage all regional partners to do the same. 
<br> 
<br>-- Encourage host government to carefully monitor any 
<br>financial and commercial activity with Iran within KSA to 
<br>ensure that Iran does not pursue illicit transactions via the 
<br>KSA. 
<br> 
<br>-- Encourage host government to use its influence in the GCC 
<br>to invigorate further actions by regional partners to enhance 
<br>vigilance over financial and commercial activity with Iran, 
<br>as is called for by the Financial Action Task Force and 
<br>UNSCRs 1737, 1747, and 1803.

<br>NONPAPER 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S//REL SAU)  BEGIN NON-PAPER FOR SAUDI ARABIA 
<br> 
<br>During Acting Assistant Secretary Patricia McNerney's visit 
<br>to Saudi Arabia on 15 October 2008, she raised the issue of 
<br>Iran's nuclear program and the need to increase pressure on 
<br>the Iranian regime to address international concerns 
<br>surrounding its nuclear activities.  Undersecretary for 
<br>Multilateral Affairs Prince Turki Bin Mohamed Bin Saud 
<br>Al-Kabeer requested suggestions on steps the Kingdom of Saudi 
<br>Arabia could take in this regard. 
<br> 
<br>We believe your government should consider taking action on 
<br>the following key priorities: 
<br> 
<br>-- National Financial Measures 
<br> 
<br>-- Export Control Implementation 
<br> 
<br>-- Express Resolve on the Iranian Threat, and 
<br> 
<br>-- Full Implementation of UNSCRs, particularly 1803. 
<br> 
<br>Your vigilance thus far demonstrates your government,s 
<br>recognition that real action must be taken to protect the 
<br>region,s security by preventing Iranian proliferation. We 
<br>believe that if your government implemented the actions 
<br>suggested in this paper, it would not only allow you to 
<br>exercise influential leadership with regional neighbors, it 
<br>would significantly increase the pressure on Iran to 
<br>cooperate with the international community and address its 
<br>concerns. 
<br> 
<br>We would like to present to you the following recommendations 
<br>and the United States is prepared to work with the KSA to 
<br>assist with the incorporation of these measures into Saudi 
<br>Arabia's nonproliferation system. 
<br> 
<br>National Financial Measures: 
<br> 
<br>-- We urge the Saudi Government to issue a public statement 
<br>that advances the October 2008 Financial Action Task Force 
<br>(FATF) statement on Iran. The Saudi statement should 
<br>recommend heightened vigilance and the implementation of 
<br>preventive measures, per FATF,s October statements, by all 
<br>countries with respect to the financial transactions with 
<br>Iran given the significant vulnerability that Iran poses to 
<br>the international financial system. A statement like this 
<br>from your government would send a clear message to your GCC 
<br>partners that the risk arising from Iranian banking 
<br>transactions is real and that action must be taken to protect 
<br>the region,s banking system and prevent Iranian 
<br>proliferation. 
<br> 
<br>-- On October 16, the FATF issued its fourth warning of the 
<br>serious threat posed by Iran's lack of a sufficient 
<br>anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing regime. 
<br>In contrast with prior FATF actions on Iran, this statement 
<br>marked a significant escalation in concern about the 
<br>terrorism finance threat emanating from Iran and ratcheted up 
<br>the call for preventive measures that should be implemented 
<br>by FATF members and other jurisdictions to protect their 
<br>financial sectors from this risk. 
<br> 
<br>-- During the October plenary meeting, FATF also separately 
<br>issued guidance on the steps that countries should take to 
<br>implement United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 
<br>1803's call for vigilance over the activities of financial 
<br>institutions in their territories with all banks domiciled in 
<br>Iran, in order to avoid such activities contributing to 
<br>proliferation sensitive nuclear activities or to the 
<br>development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. 
<br> 
<br>-- Iran uses deceptive tactics and front companies to 
<br>disguise its proliferation activities.  The U.S. recommends 
<br>that Saudi Arabia highlight this fact with its domestic 
<br>businesses and GCC partners. 
<br> 
<br>-- We also recommend that you reduce Saudi Arabian Industries 
<br>Corporation (SABIC) activities in Iran,s petrochemicals 
<br>market. The U.S. also proposes that Saudi Arabia suspend 
<br>Iran-GCC free trade area talks until Iran accepts the P5 1 
<br>incentives package. 
<br> 
<br>-- U.S. Executive Order (E.O.) 13382 is an authority that 
<br>allows the U.S. to block the assets of WMD proliferators and 
<br>their supporters and thereby deny them access to the U.S. 
<br>financial and commercial systems. The U.S. recommends that 
<br>Saudi Arabia explore the creation of a similar legal 
<br>authority. 
<br> 
<br>Export Control Implementation: 
<br> 
<br>-- Saudi Arabia should begin work on drafting a comprehensive 
<br>export control law and adopt a comprehensive control list 
<br>that meets international standards, including the standards 
<br>set by the four multilateral export control regimes 
<br>(Australia Group, Missile Technology Control Regime, Nuclear 
<br>Suppliers Group, and Wassenaar Group). 
<br> 
<br>-- A comprehensive export control system will give Saudi 
<br>Arabia the ability to ensure that its trade is secure and 
<br>will encourage high technology investment. 
<br> 
<br>-- The United States is prepared to support Saudi Arabia in 
<br>this regard, including through our Export Control and Related 
<br>Border Security (EXBS) Program. 
<br> 
<br>Express Resolve on the Iranian Threat: 
<br> 
<br>-- Saudi Arabia should exercise leadership with neighbors in 
<br>the region and publicly by expressing concerns about Iran,s 
<br>continued pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability and 
<br>destabilizing activities in the region. 
<br> 
<br>-- We would appreciate public expressions of support for the 
<br>P5 1 dual track process including encouragement for Iran to 
<br>accept the incentives package. 
<br> 
<br>-- Saudi Arabia should exercise its influence with China, in 
<br>particular, to persuade China to reduce its growing 
<br>energy/economic cooperation and weapons purchases. Such 
<br>efforts by China run contrary to the spirit of the UNSCRs and 
<br>the P5 1 dual track strategy. A high level Saudi delegation 
<br>could communicate to China Saudi concerns about the threat 
<br>posed by Iran,s actions. 
<br> 
<br>Full Implementation of UNSCRs: 
<br> 
<br>-- Full implementation of UNSCRs 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 
<br>and 1803 (2008), through vigilance and action against Iran,s 
<br>efforts to circumvent sanctions are key components to 
<br>maintaining pressure on Iran. 
<br> 
<br>-- A useful step would be for KSA to vigorously implement 
<br>UNSCR provisions such as freezing financial assets and 
<br>imposing travel restrictions on designated entities and 
<br>individuals, prohibit dual-use exports, call for inspections 
<br>of IRISL and Iran Air Cargo shipment, and exercise vigilance 
<br>over any activities of financial institutions in KSA with 
<br>Iranian domiciled banks. 
<br> 
<br>-- As a reference, the U.S. 60-day report on implementation 
<br>of UNSCR 1803 can be found at: 
<br>www.un.org/sc/committees/1737/memberstatesrep orts.shtml
