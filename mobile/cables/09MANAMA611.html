<br>SALMAN FOCUSES ON IRAN

<br>REF: MANAMA 599

<br>Classified By: CDA Christopher Henzel for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
<br> 
<br> ¶1.  (S) SUMMARY: During USAFCENT Commander Mike Hostage and 
<br>CDA's October 12 meeting with Crown Prince Shaikh Salman bin 
<br>Hamad al Khalifa, the CP assured them that Bahrain would keep 
<br>the pressure on Iran to live up to the commitments it made in 
<br>Geneva (reftel).  Lt Gen Hostage explained that the threat 
<br>posed by Iran was leading the U.S. to pursue a Regional 
<br>Integrated Air and Missile Defense (RIAMD) strategy with GCC 
<br>countries.  Shaikh Salman welcomed this and stressed that 
<br>Bahrain wanted to be part of the solution to the GCC's 
<br>defense integration challenges.  Lt Gen Hostage and the 
<br>Charge thanked him for Bahrain's commitment to contribute a 
<br>small contingent for the effort in Afghanistan.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>IRAN AND REGIONAL AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE: 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) On October 12, U.S. Air Forces Central (USAFCENT) 
<br>Commander Lt Gen Mike Hostage and Charge d'Affaires called on 
<br>the Crown Prince.  The CP commended COMAFCENT for now being 
<br>forward deployed to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar because it was 
<br>important to spend time with the U.S.' counterparts in the 
<br>Gulf.  If more U.S. troops were added into Afghanistan, and 
<br>Iran tried to delay the process begun in Geneva, Shaikh 
<br>Salman commented that there would be tough months ahead for 
<br>the region.  As the P5 1 pursued its carrot and stick 
<br>approach with Iran, Salman wondered if Tehran would pursue a 
<br>"tit for tat" in its military posture.  Because of the lack 
<br>of sophisticated intelligence gathering among the Gulf 
<br>states, the CP observed that the press "plays a propaganda 
<br>war into our psyche."  He decried Iran's interference in Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) Lt Gen Hostage explained that, because of the threat 
<br>posed by Iran to the region, his primary goal was to work on 
<br>establishing Regional Integrated Air and Missile Defense 
<br>(RIAMD) between the U.S. and the GCC states.  First, this 
<br>involved integrating the U.S.' own air and missile defense 
<br>assets (Navy Aegis, Army Patriots, etc.).  Then he would 
<br>offer to link each Gulf state into a Shared Early Warning 
<br>(SEW) Common Operating Picture (COP), to the extent that each 
<br>government was willing to participate.  The U.S. would share 
<br>the same picture to all, and each could add as much 
<br>information as it liked, while keeping data it did not wish 
<br>to share behind a secure firewall. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) The CP responded that this would be the largest game 
<br>changer because it would be a permanent fixture and would 
<br>affect Iran's ability to project power.  He thanked the U.S. 
<br>for the two U.S. Patriot batteries stationed here and said he 
<br>would like to help further integrate the Gulf states into 
<br>RIAMD project because it would not be enough without 
<br>everyone's participation.  He cautioned, however, that the 
<br>U.S. would have to lead the effort and it would have to be 
<br>bilaterally with each government, with a multilateral system 
<br>as the long-term goal.  He asked whether and where the U.S. 
<br>would deploy a THAAD (Theater High Altitude Air Defense) 
<br>system to the Gulf.  Gen Hostage replied that the location 
<br>was not yet certain, but yes, THAAD would be deployed within 
<br>a year, and would prove to be a very capable mid-course 
<br>intercept system.  Prince Salman worried that, in an attack 
<br>scenario, Iran would try to swarm and overwhelm specific 
<br>targets and we would all have to be ready for that. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) Lt Gen Hostage pointed to the Air Warfare Center in 
<br>the UAE as a Center of Excellence (COE).  A COE for RIAMD 
<br>could be established there as well as a training vehicle to 
<br>help the Gulf states get comfortable with the technical 
<br>solutions so they could share information.  Shaikh Salman 
<br>said he wanted Bahrain to be part of the solution.  He noted 
<br>that Bahrain had been the first GCC government to participate 
<br>in Task Force 152 and it liked to be a leader.  "Consider us 
<br>serious partners," he stated. 
<br> 
<br>IRAN: TO DEGRADE OR DETER? 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (S) Lt Gen Hostage asked for the CP's views of Iran's 
<br>willingness to deal in good faith with the P5 1.  Shaikh 
<br>Salman said his views had not changed - Iran's behavior would 
<br>continue to be problematic.  However, he speculated that the 
<br>reason Iran had changed course and cooperated with the P5 1 
<br>in Geneva was due to Russian President Medvedev's comment at 
<br>UNGA that sometimes sanctions were unavoidable.  CDA pointed 
<br> 
<br>MANAMA 00000611  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>out that as the P5 1 pursued a dual track strategy of 
<br>engagement and preparing for sanctions, the GCC countries' 
<br>roles would be important.  Confirming that Bahrain would do 
<br>what it could to keep the pressure on Iran, the CP lamented 
<br>that Gulf countries had few levers on China.  He thought that 
<br>if Saudi Arabia were to sell more oil to China, it would help 
<br>provide some leverage. 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S) The CP asked whether Russia had shipped its S-300 air 
<br>defense system to Iran yet.  Lt Gen Hostage said no.  Salman 
<br>said he was  sure that the international community would have 
<br>to wait until the next election in Iran to see real internal 
<br>changes.  The regime was still in firm control and 
<br>Ahmadinejad was consolidating his power, even as the economy 
<br>was failing.  The world would need a strategy led by the U.S. 
<br> "We are still a ways away from knowing whether force is 
<br>necessary," the CP stated. 
<br> 
<br>BAHRAIN'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE EFFORT IN AFGHANISTAN 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) The CP asked whether the U.S. was changing its goals 
<br>in Afghanistan to a strategy of reconciliation and power 
<br>sharing with some elements of the Taliban while targeting 
<br>senior Al Qaeda figures.  Lt Gen Hostage said a way had to be 
<br>found to let the Afghans live in their, not our, version of 
<br>peace, but he wondered whether it could be done on our 
<br>timeline.  Shaikh Salman counseled patience as with the 
<br>implementation of the surge in Iraq.  Lt Gen Hostage and 
<br>Charge thanked him for Bahrain's commitment to contribute a 
<br>company from its security forces to provide inner perimeter 
<br>security at a coalition base in Afghanistan.  Shaikh Salman 
<br>stated that  his father King Hamad had approved a budget of 
<br>USD 13 million for the deployment the day before, so the 
<br>troops would have the necessary equipment. 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (C) The CP asked whether the U.S. would still need to 
<br>deploy aerial refueling tankers to Isa Air Base.  Lt Gen 
<br>Hostage related that AFCENT's problems with the Manas Air 
<br>Base (Transit Center) in Kyrgyzstan had been resolved.
