<br>
<br>Ref: khartoum 00378
<br>
<br>Classified By: CDA Robert Whitehead for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) GOSS xxxxxxxxxxxx has admitted that, on
<br>the margins of the Washington "Forum for CPA Partners," he
<br>pressed Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula on the need
<br>to expedite delivery to South Sudan of tanks off-loaded from
<br>the MV Faina. Three months had passed since Nairobi
<br>initially agreed -- albeit in a staggered fashion and only
<br>under cover of darkness -- to ship the SPLA its second order
<br>of tanks (REFTEL Khartoum 00378). According to xxxxxxxxxxxx upon
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx instruction he told the Kenyan ForMin that if the
<br>tanks did not start moving by Juli's end, the GOSS would be
<br>forced to "reevaluate its relationship with Nairobi. Despite
<br>such threats, xxxxxxxxxxxx maintained that the meeting was largely
<br>positive. "The Kenyans are relieved that we will be routing
<br>them through Uganda -- keeping them out of the spotlight."
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Asked whether he was any more confident of actual
<br>delivery, given how earlier promises from the Kenyans had
<br>vaporized, xxxxxxxxxxxx responded in the affirmative. xxxxxxxxxxxx and
<br>newly-appointed xxxxxxxxxxxx had met in
<br>Nairobi as xxxxxxxxxxxx returned from Washington to again discuss the
<br>transfer with Kenyan Department of Defense counterparts. "We
<br>are certain that this time they will move." xxxxxxxxxxxx further
<br>confirmed that weapons, armaments, and the spare parts and
<br>support packages for the T-72 tanks had already been moved
<br>out of Nairobi into Sudan's South, although he would not
<br>divulge their location. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx optimism appears to be merited. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>travelled to Kampala xxxxxxxxxxxx in order to meet with Ugandan counterparts on unspecified
<br>business. xxxxxxxxxxxx remains an
<br>integral member of the SPLA's tank procurement team, despite
<br>the SPLA's May reshuffle which pushed him into the xxxxxxxxxxxx. SPLA Affairs Minister Nhial Deng Nhial
<br>admitted to A/CG xxxxxxxxxxxx had been granted
<br>extraordinary authorities to handle the totality of the
<br>SPLA's outstanding contracts in order to ensure the circle of
<br>those involved in the tank procurement remained small "for
<br>obvious security reasons." xxxxxxxxxxxx The
<br>decision to extend such authorities xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>would appear to indicate the entire "adminstrative chain" of
<br>the SPLA has been shielded from the decision. END COMMENT).
<br>At a July 23 farewell dinner, xxxxxxxxxxxx confirmed the Kenyans had
<br>begun trans-shipment of tanks to Uganda, but could not speak
<br>to when they would arrive in the South.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Per reftel, the SPLA is dependent on Nairobi
<br>concurrence to authorize the third and final shipment of
<br>Juba's 2006 tanks purchase. xxxxxxxxxxxx maintained in mid-July that
<br>Nairobi, facing increasing pressure from Khartoum, continued
<br>to resist green-lighting the shipment. Notwithstanding
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx contention that the Juba/Nairobi bilateral
<br>relationship was weathering the tank-shipment "stand-off,"
<br>there is growing vidence to the contrary.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx that she had access to
<br>documents pertaining to a pending bank transfer linked to an
<br>unspecified SPLA procurement initiative worth $34 million.
<br>According to the contractor, past SPLA contracts consistently
<br>included routing information for banks to Kenya. This
<br>contract did not -- a first in this individual's tenure with
<br>the Finance Ministry. (NOTE: The contractor further advised
<br>that the contract would drive SPLA finances into the red;
<br>unless the SPLA saw a budget increase next fiscal year, the
<br>SPLA would be without financing until April 2010 if this
<br>contract moved forward. END NOTE.) As of July 24, the
<br>contractor did not believe this SPLA contract had gone
<br>forward in the Finance Ministry's internal approval process.
<br>
<br>Khartoum 00000881 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>(COMMENT: We are not sure that the contractor would be privy
<br>to information regarding this contract's approval, however,
<br>and think it possible that, given Finance Minister David Deng
<br>Athorbei's failed attempts to purchase attack helicopters for
<br>the SPLA out of Ministry of Roads and Transport monies in
<br>November 2008, he might be sympathetic to other SPLA
<br>procurement requests despite current GOSS budgeting woes. END
<br>comment).
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Comment. Despite extensive coverage of the tank
<br>purchases and delivery in local and internationl media, the
<br>SPLM continues to treat the matter as a secret matter,
<br>perhaps as a concession to Kenyan sensitivities. The
<br>existence of the tanks, however, is one of the least secret
<br>secrets in Khartoum.
