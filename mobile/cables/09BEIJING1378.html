<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The book "Unhappy China," a nationalistic 
<br>rant against the United States and China's own 
<br>supposedly West-worshipping elite, sold briskly in 
<br>China following its release in March, but sales 
<br>appear to have tapered off. China's official media 
<br>have been largely critical of the book. Only a 
<br>"small minority" of Chinese citizens subscribes to 
<br>the authors' nationalism and anti-Americanism, 
<br>numerous contacts have told PolOffs. The book's 
<br>radicalism was largely a "ploy" to boost sales, but 
<br>will not sway a sophisticated and internationally 
<br>oriented Chinese public, many contacts said. 
<br>America's image has improved significantly, 
<br>including among recent university graduates, thanks 
<br>to President Bush's attendance at the 2008 Beijing 
<br>Olympics opening ceremony and the election of 
<br>President Obama. While most Embassy interlocutors 
<br>downplayed the idea that "Unhappy China" enjoyed 
<br>high-level Party support, two pro-democracy scholars 
<br>theorized that "leftist" leaders find the work 
<br>"useful" for nudging the Chinese public away from 
<br>Western economic and political models. The only 
<br>contact who warned us that nationalism was on the 
<br>rise was one of the book's authors, Wang Xiaodong. 
<br>Young, educated urban Chinese are "extremely 
<br>nationalistic," and the government is wary of them, 
<br>Wang told PolOff. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>UNHAPPY CHINA, HAPPY PUBLISHER 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The book "Unhappy China" (Zhongguo Bu 
<br>Gaoxing) has been billed as a follow-on to the 1996 
<br>book "China Can Say No." Song Qiang, one of the 
<br>five authors of Unhappy China, contributed to the 
<br>1996 volume. After its release in China on March 
<br>12, "Unhappy China" hit the best-sellers list with 
<br>over 600,000 copies sold the first month, according 
<br>to dangdang.com (one of China's most popular online 
<br>bookstores). An April 13 report in China Newsweek 
<br>(Zhongguo Xinwen Zhoukan) put the book's first 
<br>month's sales at a more modest 470,000, though the 
<br>story notes this was enough to net each of the 
<br>book's five authors RMB 1.4 million (USD 206,000) in 
<br>royalties. Two months after its release, however, 
<br>sales have apparently fallen substantially. As of 
<br>May 11, the book failed to register in the top 100 
<br>best-sellers on amazon.cn. 
<br>
<br>PRC MEDIA LARGELY CRITICAL 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) China's English-language media have mostly 
<br>panned the book. On March 25, the Xinhua News 
<br>Agency's English-language service issued a report 
<br>stating the book had "failed to strike a chord among 
<br>average Chinese" and was selling "poorly" at Beijing 
<br>bookstores. Chinese-language media, while still 
<br>critical of the book's tone, have been less 
<br>dismissive of its impact. The China Youth Daily 
<br>(CYD), the paper of the Communist Youth League, 
<br>published a scathing essay on April 8 that was 
<br>widely reprinted on the Internet. The CYD piece 
<br>drew the distinction between "healthy nationalism," 
<br>such as that championed by Sun Yat-sen or Gandhi, to 
<br>the "narcissistic" (zilian) and "bellicose" 
<br>(haozhan) nationalism espoused by the Unhappy China 
<br>authors, who brag about China's cultural superiority 
<br>and the need for China to take over the United 
<br>States' role as world leader. A March 30 Xinhua 
<br>story headlined "Unhappy China Shakes the West" 
<br>noted the great attention the book had received 
<br>abroad. Though the Xinhua article quoted Chinese 
<br>scholars who denounced the book's extremist 
<br>rhetoric, it also devoted substantial space to the 
<br>authors' defense of their work. People's Daily, the 
<br>mouthpiece of the Communist Party Central Committee, 
<br>has largely ignored Unhappy China, although on April 
<br>8 the paper quoted a scholar as saying that while 
<br>the views in the book were irrational, China should 
<br>allow different voices to be heard. At least one 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00001378 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>paper, the Beijing Evening News (Beijing Wanbao), 
<br>which is published by the Beijing Municipal Party 
<br>Committee, has defended Unhappy China. On April 10 
<br>the paper ran a blistering editorial accusing Hong 
<br>Kong's Phoenix Television of pro-Western bias 
<br>because many of the station's guests and 
<br>commentators had denounced the book. 
<br>
<br>INTERNET REACTION LESS HOSTILE 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Though Unhappy China has met with mostly 
<br>harsh reviews in the mainstream media, Internet 
<br>reaction has been more favorable. An on-line 
<br>opinion poll conducted by the web portal Sina.com 
<br>showed that 70 percent of the survey's 19,000 
<br>participants believed Unhappy China discussed 
<br>important domestic and international issues and 
<br>problems "worthy of deep thought." Twenty-one 
<br>percent described the book as "too extreme" and 
<br>"opportunistic." 
<br>
<br>FRINGE APPEAL ONLY 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Beijing-based contacts universally criticized 
<br>the book in discussions with PolOffs. Most 
<br>described it as representing only a "small fringe" 
<br>of Chinese society and urged the USG not to pay too 
<br>much attention to the tome's anti-Americanism. Some 
<br>journalist contacts (ref B) saw the book as a "joke" 
<br>whose radical tone was meant to shock and sell 
<br>books. XXXXXXXXXXXX said XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> that his first complaint about the book was the poor
<br>quality of the  writing. To produce the book, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said, the authors merely recorded
<br>a series of conversations  that were then edited into essays.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said even  a bad review by the
<br>Economic Observer would have  given the book more publicity
<br>than it deserved, so  his paper had ignored the book altogether.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX), told PolOff XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>that Unhappy China did not represent mainstream views. 
<br>The Chinese public was now much more globalized and 
<br>had a better understanding of the world than was the 
<br>case in 1996, when "China Can Say No" hit the 
<br>shelves. Unhappy China, XXXXXXXXXXXX argued,
<br>thus did not  have the same traction as the earlier book. 
<br>Nevertheless, in a nod to the high level of public 
<br>interest, the Beijing News had devoted a full page 
<br>to Unhappy China in its March 28 edition, including 
<br>an interview with author Wang Xiaodong and critical 
<br>commentary by a scholar. 
<br>
<br>UNITED STATES' IMAGE ON THE RISE 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In a conversation with PolOff
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX, likewise
<br>said Unhappy China  represented a minority view and that,
<br>at most, "20  percent" of the Chinese public subscribed to
<br>the  kind of nationalism espoused by the authors
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said Unhappy China was
<br>mainly a  "commercial exercise," with the book'
<br> extremism  merely a "ploy" to boost sales.
<br>Nevertheless, XXXXXXXXXXXX  said, the book
<br>did appeal to "less educated  Chinese."
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said the book had not received 
<br>support from any individual or faction within the 
<br>CCP leadership. The book also did not reflect an 
<br>overall rise in nationalism or anti-Americanism in 
<br>China. The image of the United States, XXXXXXXXXX
<br> said, was actually quite good thanks to President Bush's 
<br>attendance at the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony 
<br>and the generally warm feeling Chinese have toward 
<br>President Obama. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX, echoed  XXXXXXXXXXXX 's
<br>analysis, saying that the United States' image  on college
<br>campuses had improved since  the election  of President
<br>Obama. XXXXXXXXXXXX said Unhappy China 
<br>tapped into the "natural pride" young Chinese felt 
<br>at their country's growing power, which seemed even 
<br>more evident since the global financial crisis threw 
<br>most Western economies into recession. When the 
<br>United States was booming economically,
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX argued, many Americans
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00001378 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>showed the same air of superiority  and sense of power 
<br>hat the authors of Unhappy China  now displayed. 
<br>
<br>
<br>A TOOL OF LEFTISTS? 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) In contrast, XXXXXXXXXXXX, and
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  saw greater political
<br>significance in Unhappy China.  
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXXXXXX said 
<br>that given China's tight censorship, such a book 
<br>could not have been published without support from 
<br>high-level leaders, possibly including President Hu 
<br>Jintao himself. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that most
<br>of the criticism  of Unhappy China had come from
<br>urban professionals,  but the book did resonate with
<br>the wider population.  Nationalism, according to
<br>XXXXXXXXXXX, remained a potent  force in
<br>China even though society as a whole was 
<br>Becoming more mature. XXXXXXXXXXXX  believed
<br>that left-  leaning members of the leadership did not 
<br>necessarily like or agree with the contents of the 
<br>book, particularly its foreign policy prescriptions, 
<br>but saw it as "useful" for pushing the public more 
<br>to the left and reducing popular support in general 
<br>for Western economic and political models. Hu 
<br>Jintao, XXXXXXXXXXXX argued, was not
<br>necessarily pushing the  book but, due to his
<br>background, tended to accept  "leftist" ideas as
<br>"normal." 
<br>
<br>WANG XIAODONG SPEAKS 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>AUTHORS' PRO-DEMOCRACY VIEWS CENSORED 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Wang repeatedly asserted that nationalists 
<br>were supportive of democracy and human rights. When 
<br>sovereignty issues were not involved, ordinary 
<br>Chinese were not opposed to outside criticism and 
<br>agreed that human rights should be improved. "Only 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00001378 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>the Chinese central government is irritated with 
<br>foreign criticism of China's human rights 
<br>situation." Wang described himself as a "pro-reform 
<br>intellectual," saying his contributions to the book 
<br>"clearly" stated his support for "democracy." 
<br>Censors, however, deleted most passages in the 
<br>original draft regarding democracy or involving 
<br>criticism of Chairman Mao Zedong, Wang claimed. 
<br>Even so, Wang said, overall he had been surprised at 
<br>how much the censors let through. (Note: Song 
<br>Qiang, in an interview with Xinhua, also noted that 
<br>parts of Unhappy China dealing with domestic 
<br>politics were cut in order to ensure publication.) 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) In person as in his writing, Wang seemed especially
<br>incensed at the behavior of "so-called  liberals" in China
<br>who, he asserted, were really  "reverse racists." These 
<br>iberals, Wang said, point to the Cultural Revolution as 
<br>proof that Chinese  people were inherently mean and 
<br>wallowed in a self-  loathing view of China's inferiority
<br>compared to the West. Far from secretly supporting the book,
<br>Wang  asserted, China's government had a "hostile 
<br>reaction" to Unhappy China, and the CCP Propaganda 
<br>Department had ordered official media to criticize 
<br>it. The book, he added, was also "very unpopular at 
<br>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs." Despite the 
<br>hostility of the central government, Wang claimed, 
<br>the book was selling well, especially among military 
<br>officers, local government cadres, and young people. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) The high sales of Unhappy China show that 
<br>there is a reservoir of nationalistic sentiment in 
<br>China, even though it may not be as large as Wang 
<br>Xiaodong describes. Some of this can be attributed 
<br>to China's education system, which continues to 
<br>stress the "bullying" and "humiliation" China 
<br>endured at the hands of Western powers in centuries 
<br>past. That the CCP's Propaganda Department 
<br>encouraged negative press coverage of the book 
<br>indicates the Party remains wary of nationalism 
<br>getting out of hand. Nationalists, as Wang argued, 
<br>do not necessarily support the Party. However, most 
<br>of our contacts believe that Chinese society has, 
<br>thanks to increasing contact with the outside world, 
<br>undergone change over the last decade that is 
<br>causing nationalism to give way to a more positive 
<br>sense of national pride. According to these 
<br>contacts, the Chinese who warmly welcomed U.S. 
<br>women's volleyball coach Lang Ping at the 2008 
<br>Olympics (despite the fact that she previously 
<br>played and coached for China -- see ref C) now 
<br>greatly outnumber "unhappy" nationalists.
