<br> 
<br> 
<br>1.(S) SUMMARY.  Senator Joseph Lieberman met with Sheikh 
<br>Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum (MbR), Vice President and Prime 
<br>Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, on 29 May.  MbR voiced 
<br>support for US policy in Iraq, but expressed strong reservations 
<br>about the al Maliki government and its links to Iran.  He called 
<br>for new elections to produce leaders who would work for Iraq's 
<br>interests. He voiced suspicion of Iran's goals in the region, 
<br>and their claims that their nuclear program was for energy 
<br>purposes alone.  He recommended, however, that the US seek to 
<br>contain Iran through negotiations and diplomacy. Using force, he 
<br>said, would only help the current leadership stay in power. MbR 
<br>also talked about his ambitions for Dubai as a regional model, 
<br>noting "we want to be number one." END SUMMARY 
<br> 
<br>2.(SBU) Senator Lieberman, along with the Ambassador, Consul 
<br>General, codel staff members and ConGen staff met MbR at the 
<br>Zabeel Palace in Dubai on 29 May.  Joining MbR were Mohammad 
<br>al-Gergawi, his principal aide and UAE Minister for Cabinet 
<br>Affairs; Major General Dhahi Khalfan al-Tamim, Commander of the 
<br>Dubai Police; Brigadier Mohammad al-Qemzi, Director of the Dubai 
<br>General Department of State Security; Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed 
<br>al-Maktoum, head of Dubai Civil aviation and Emirates Airlines; 
<br>and a number of MbR's sons, including Sheikh Rashid bin 
<br>Mohammad, Sheikh Mohammad's eldest son; and Sheikh Hamdan bin 
<br>Mohammad, Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council and Sheikh 
<br>Mohammad's heir apparent. 
<br> 
<br>Iraq:  Any plan B? 
<br>------------------ 
<br> 
<br>3.(C) MbR restated the UAE's support for the US in the region, 
<br>noting "the UAE is the only country that is 100 percent with the 
<br>US." MbR said UAE support for the US effort remained firm, but 
<br>asked what is "plan B" should the current US approach not 
<br>stabilize Iraq. Senator Lieberman quoted the Chairman of the 
<br>Joint Chiefs of Staff as saying "plan B is to make plan A work." 
<br> 
<br>Alternative Approaches: New Elections in Iraq? 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br> 
<br>4.(S) Asked by the Senator for his advice on steps to move the 
<br>situation in Iraq forward, MbR commented that he has little 
<br>confidence in Iraqi PM al Maliki, and believes his loyalties lie 
<br>elsewhere, i.e. Iran.  MbR suggested the way ahead would be 
<br>improved by new elections, which he believes would now yield a 
<br>better leader who is loyal to Iraq. Senator Lieberman noted he 
<br>thought that al Maliki and his allies would oppose new elections. 
<br> 
<br>The Problem of Al-Sadr 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>5.(S) MbR said that at the moment Muqtada al-Sadr is the single 
<br>most powerful person in Iraq; the US should act against him, 
<br>i.e. arrest and imprison him.  Asked if new elections might not 
<br>yield a al-Sadr victory, MbR made clear he thought Sunnis would 
<br>now turn out in large numbers and that al-Sadr would not be able 
<br>to win - were the election fair.  (Comment: Reflecting 
<br>commonly-held thinking by UAE seniors, he clearly implied that 
<br>al-Maliki had been elected through rigging in the last Iraqi 
<br>vote.  End comment.) 
<br> 
<br>Progress in Anbar Province: Look to the Tribes 
<br>--------------------------------------------- - 
<br> 
<br>6.(C) Commenting on the improved security situation in western 
<br>Iraq, MbR voiced strong support for closer cooperation with the 
<br>tribal sheikhs.  As has been proven, if the tribal leaders can 
<br>be co-opted to work with the US, they have the ability to defeat 
<br>or suppress Al-Qaeda.  He stressed the importance of working 
<br>with the tribes without regard to their being Sunni or Shia. 
<br> 
<br>Sheikh Mohammad on Iran 
<br>----------------------- 
<br> 
<br>7.(C) Senator Lieberman asked MbR for his views on Iran and US 
<br>policies vis-`-vis Iran.  MbR stated Iran is a large country 
<br>with great ambitions, a historic sense of its importance, and a 
<br>desire to dominate the region culturally and politically. Iran 
<br>has a long-term strategy for the region, and would like to 
<br>recreate the Persian Empire and spread Shi'a Islam throughout 
<br>area. Rehearsing themes often heard by US senior visitors, MbR 
<br>said Iran "can make trouble throughout the region" if it is 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000355  002.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>provoked.  While he suggested that Iran is the cause of the 
<br>deteriorating situations in Afghanistan and Iraq, he also noted 
<br>that Iran could make the situation in Afghanistan, for example, 
<br>"explode" should chose to do so. 
<br> 
<br>Iran Promises a Peaceful Nuclear Program 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>8.(C) MbR told the Senator that the UAE does not want Iran to 
<br>acquire nuclear weapons. He said that during the recent visit of 
<br>Iranian President Ahmadinejad to the UAE that the Iranians had 
<br>promised their nuclear program is only to help meet domestic 
<br>energy needs -- quipping "how much can we believe what the 
<br>Iranians say is another question."  MbR seemed perplexed about 
<br>the work of the IAEA inspectors and believed that they could 
<br>provide an objective view of the program.  Senator Lieberman 
<br>reminded MbR that Iran has blocked the inspectors and they have 
<br>only been able to conclude that Iran will have the capacity to 
<br>produce enriched uranium on a sufficient scale to either 
<br>generate power or create a nuclear weapon within the next three 
<br>to eight years. 
<br> 
<br>Negotiations - the Best Course of Action 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>9.(C) MbR and the Senator briefly discussed the recent meeting 
<br>in Baghdad between the US and Iran.  MbR saw this as a very 
<br>positive move, recommending negotiations as the best way forward 
<br>with Iran.  He said that threatening Iran encourages the Iranian 
<br>leaders to be defiant.  Iranians are proud and the current 
<br>extremist leadership would not only endure, but benefit from an 
<br>attack by the US. Such attacks would ensure the continuing power 
<br>of the current government (note: presumable by rallying all 
<br>Iranians behind it in the face of a foreign enemy). 
<br> 
<br>10.(C) Senator Lieberman commented would maintain the stick even 
<br>while it considered the carrot, and that the two carrier battle 
<br>groups now in the Gulf were sending a message to Iran.  MbR 
<br>responded that everyone in the region knows the US is powerful 
<br>and can fight two wars simultaneously.  He said that part of the 
<br>problem "is the way you (the US) talk."  After making a demand, 
<br>"you (the US) should take two steps back before your next 
<br>action."  Everyone in the region needs to avoid the dangerous 
<br>cycle of action and reaction.  The Israeli-Palestinian problem 
<br>has worsened because actions are followed immediately by 
<br>reactions without thought. 
<br> 
<br>11.(S) Brigadier Mohammad al-Qemzi, who heads State Security in 
<br>Dubai added that the Iranians are traditionally great game 
<br>players.  He said that the US should play the game of 
<br>negotiation and diplomacy (to contain Iran) rather than engaging 
<br>in hostilities.  Al-Qemzi recommended working for the longer 
<br>term, and believes that there will be a cultural and leadership 
<br>change in Iran -- over time, Iran would change for the better. 
<br> 
<br>UAE Support for Counter Proliferation 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>12.(S) MbR reiterated the UAE's continued support of the US' 
<br>counter proliferation efforts in the region.  Brigadier al-Qemzi 
<br>added that the previous day and in the previous week the UAE had 
<br>stopped Iranian vessels at US request suspected of carrying 
<br>goods proscribed by the UN sanctions regime.  The UAE, he said, 
<br>would continue to work with us to stringently enforce UN 
<br>sanctions. 
<br> 
<br>Dubai, the Region, and Transformation via Education 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>13.(C) Noting Dubai appeared to be a model of tolerance and 
<br>opportunity for the region, Senator Lieberman asked MbR to talk 
<br>about his goals for the emirate. MbR said bluntly "we want to be 
<br>number one."  But, he said that Dubai has only taken the first 
<br>step on a journey of 1000 miles. He said that if Dubai plays it 
<br>right, the whole region can develop like Dubai. 
<br> 
<br>14.(SBU) MbR indicated that Dubai has succeeded because it is a 
<br>place where all people can enjoy health, wealth, security, and 
<br>the opportunity to succeed. Commenting on his recent 
<br>announcement at the World Economic Forum in Jordan of a new $10 
<br>billion Mohammed Bin Rashid Foundation for education and job 
<br>creation (septel), he said "God gave us wealth and we must give 
<br>it back to the people in the region."  MbR sees Dubai as the 
<br>leading city of a wide region and he commented "I am serving 1.5 
<br>billion [people] in the region."  MbR underscored that education 
<br>is the key to regional modernization and moderation. In Dubai, 
<br>he noted, "we are trying to teach people how to fish and not 
<br>just giving a fish to our neighbor." 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000355  003.2 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>15 (SBU) He also called for more US universities in Dubai, and 
<br>asked for Senator Lieberman's help in resurrecting the 
<br>possibility of the University of Connecticut building a sizeable 
<br>campus here (note: this deal was put on hold by UCONN leadership 
<br>after Connecticut state legislators and others objected to the 
<br>UAE regulation which prevents the entry of Israeli passport 
<br>holders). 
<br> 
<br>16.(U) Senator Lieberman has cleared this cable.
