<br>SUBJECT: DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DENNIS BLAIR'S 
<br>MEETING WITH PRESIDENT CALDERON, OCTOBER 19 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Carlos Pascual. 
<br>Reason: 1.4 (b),(d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary. DNI Dennis Blair met with President 
<br>Calderon for about forty minutes at the Presidential Palace 
<br>on October 19. The bulk of the discussion focused on 
<br>cooperation on intelligence sharing and the integration of 
<br>operations by Mexican intelligence and law enforcement 
<br>authorities. Calderon also commented extensively on 
<br>political developments in Latin American and the role of the 
<br>United States. While he said the United States had regained 
<br>significant stature in Latin America, he also urged greater 
<br>U.S. involvement in the politics of the region. Several 
<br>upcoming elections will be critical in shaping the region's 
<br>political course. The U.S., he said, needs to be seen as a 
<br>critical player. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) The issue at the heart of the discussion was that 
<br>Mexico must continue to improve its coordination and response 
<br>capacity among its own security forces to act effectively on 
<br>intelligence leads regardless of the source, including 
<br>Mexico's own internal intelligence channels. Mexico's 
<br>Federal Police still largely bases its operational capacity 
<br>in Mexico City. The Secretary of Defense (SEDENA) is more 
<br>decentralized, but has yet to define a cooperative platform 
<br>to work with the Federal Police. When operations are 
<br>undertaken in rural areas with difficult terrain, the 
<br>complexity of moving large security operations in a short 
<br>time frame may often result in targeted individuals escaping 
<br>from these operations. Calderon said this situation made him 
<br>"very sad," and that it was a "great mistake" on their part. 
<br>Further, Calderon indicated that he would assess the 
<br>possibility of creating a joint strike force capability. 
<br>(Note: In separate subsequent meetings, a discussion was 
<br>launched with GOM officials on the possibility of undertaking 
<br>a simulated exercise that would begin to test how multiple 
<br>agencies could cooperate together (septel). End note.) 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Blair underscored that the fight against crime has 
<br>to move beyond high-value targets. "Cut the head off this 
<br>snake and new heads will grow." Blair said the key 
<br>ingredient to success is generating community confidence to 
<br>call in tips against drug traffickers. To get that, people 
<br>need to feel secure -- they have to believe that the police 
<br>can maintain public safety. And it also means that 
<br>intelligence has to be used quickly, effectively, and 
<br>responsibly. Intelligence, operations, and institutional 
<br>capacity have to be interwoven. Calderon agreed. He 
<br>responded, "You made it very clear. Without attacking the 
<br>body as well, we can't win. And we have to create the 
<br>capacity to take on the body." 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) DNI Blair asked Calderon for his perspective on 
<br>political developments in the region and how the United 
<br>States could continue to increase its diplomatic 
<br>effectiveness. Calderon emphasized that Venezuelan President 
<br>Hugo Chavez is active everywhere, including Mexico. He went 
<br>out of his way to highlight that he believes Chavez funded 
<br>the PRD opposition during the Presidential campaign nearly 
<br>four years ago. Chavez uses social programs, including 
<br>sending doctors, to curry political influence, and there are 
<br>governors in Mexico who may be friendly to him. Calderon 
<br>said that Mexico is trying to isolate Venezuela through the 
<br>Rio Group. Calderon also commented that he is particularly 
<br>concerned about Venezuela's relations with Iran, and that the 
<br>Iranian Embassy in Mexico is very active. Calderon 
<br>underscored that Iran's growing influence in Latin American 
<br>should be of considerable concern to the United States, and 
<br>Chavez is doing all he can to aid and abet it. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Calderon exhorted the U.S. to watch Guatemala and 
<br>Belize, since their internal weaknesses make them vulnerable. 
<br>He is concerned about Mexico's southern border, and said the 
<br>GOM is starting a strategic planning process to better treat 
<br>the topic. (Note: Calderon is scheduled to visit Guatemala 
<br>next week. End note.) Calderon later in the meeting raised 
<br>the southern border again as an area for U.S.-Mexico 
<br>cooperation. Ambassador Pascual noted that the U.S. and 
<br>Mexico were to hold the next day a joint conference on the 
<br>Guatemala border to combat arms trafficking from the south.

<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Circling back to Venezuela, Calderon said that 
<br>Chavez has no qualms about involving himself in Latin 
<br>American elections, and that he tried to do so in Mexico's 
<br>own 2006 presidential contest. The region needs a visible 
<br>U.S. presence, he noted. Chavez, said Calderon, will also 
<br>have the opportunity to do so in a number of upcoming votes, 
<br>especially Honduras. Most importantly, said Calderon, the 
<br>United States must be ready to engage the next Brazilian 
<br>president. Brazil, he said, is key to restraining Chavez, 
<br>but he lamented that President Lula has been reluctant to do 
<br>so. The U.S. needs to engage Brazil more and influence its 
<br>outlook. In closing, Calderon said that there is a link 
<br>among Iran, Venezuela, drugs, narcotics trafficking, and rule 
<br>of law issues. The U.S. should look at Latin America from an 
<br>interconnected perspective.
