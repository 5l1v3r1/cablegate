<br>SUBJECT: IRAN'S GREEN PARTY OPPOSITION: ITS BIRTH AND EVOLUTION (1/3) 
<br> 
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Alan Eyre, Director, DOS, IRPO; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Iran's Green Path Opposition (GPO) came into being 
<br>as a result of the fixed June 12 Presidential election. What 
<br>started as a movement to annul the election now gives shelter both 
<br>to those seeking the full set of rights guaranteed them by Islamic 
<br>Iran's Constitution and others seeking a new system altogether. 
<br>Although the numbers of those publicly willing to march under its 
<br>banner have decreased in the face of regime brutality, its current 
<br>core group, mostly college-age urban youth, have shown no sign of 
<br>giving up the fight.   But like the regime that seeks to crush it, 
<br>the GPO is not monolithic and there is a clear gulf between the 
<br>opposition's elite leadership and the popular movement protesting 
<br>in the streets.  Remaining outside the umbrella of the GPO is an 
<br>array of unsatisfied groups whose willingness to join the GPO is 
<br>unclear.  These groups clearly oppose President Ahmadinejad but do 
<br>not yet seek, as do many GPO elements, to overturn the entire 
<br>system. END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) NOTE: This is the first in a series of three cables 
<br>examining the Iranian Opposition since the June 12 Presidential 
<br>election, what might happen in the short-term, and what the most 
<br>effective levers of US policy have been so far and what combination 
<br>may have the most impact in the coming months. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶I. BIRTH OF THE GPO 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) ELECTION BUILD-UP AND ORIGINS OF THE GREEN PATH OPPOSITION: 
<br>Iran's current unrest began in June 2009, when Iran's lackluster 
<br>Presidential campaign became energized by a (first-time) series of 
<br>televised debates among the four Presidential candidates:  former 
<br>Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi (reformist), former Speaker 
<br>Mehdi Karrubi (reformist), Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen 
<br>Rezai (moderate conservative) and President Ahmadinejad (hard-line 
<br>conservative).  President Ahmadinejad's accusations that former 
<br>Presidents Rafsanjani and Khatami were 'plotting' against his 
<br>government and, along with Mousavi and other reformists, sought to 
<br>undermine the Revolution and to enrich themselves, galvanized 
<br>ordinary Iranians.  Incivility and accusations at odds with 
<br>obligatory Persian politesse  left many observers with the 
<br>impression (discomforting for some, energizing for others) that the 
<br>elections might actually be more of a true contest than past 
<br>elections, and that Ahmadinejad might actually be vulnerable to an 
<br>upset. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) These Presidential debates sparked popular interest in the 
<br>election, and in the last week or so before the June 12 vote 
<br>reformist candidate Mousavi, with active and behind-the-scenes 
<br>support from Khatami and Rafsanjani, increasingly gained momentum, 
<br>with his supporters for the first time beginning to speak publicly 
<br>of a 'Green Movement.' Part of his support were young, first-time 
<br>voters; part were revitalized older 'Second of Khordad' reformists 
<br>who had turned out in record number to support Khatami in 1997 and 
<br>2001, but who had subsequently sourced on politics due to Khatami's 
<br>inability to effect change.  Another large group of first-time 
<br>voters were from the ranks of the "Khamoush" ('silent') - ie, 
<br>Iranians who had never voted but who were inspired by prospects for 
<br>positive change and had hope that this election would be genuine. 
<br>Mousavi may have even drawn some support for older and more 
<br>conservative voters who remembered his steady stewardship of Iran's 
<br>economy during his stint as Prime Minister during the 1980's 
<br>Iran-Iraq War. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) ELECTION DAY: IRIG elections have never been 'free and 
<br>fair,' but until June 2009 most electoral machinations consisted 
<br>primarily of the conservative Guardian Council screening out 
<br>ideologically undesirable candidates, plus vote manipulation at 
<br>relatively low levels, including using the Basij to 'get out the 
<br>vote.'  Conventional wisdom going into June 12 was that a high 
<br>turnout -- representing energized young and urban voters -- would 
<br>favor Mousavi, who would need a few million vote 'cushion' in order 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000013  002 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>to either win outright or to get into a subsequent two-man runoff 
<br>with Ahmadinejad.  While we don't know nor might not ever know the 
<br>real June 12 vote count, it is clear that the turnout was at record 
<br>high levels and that there was systematic vote count fraud (if in 
<br>fact the votes were even counted) to ensure that Ahmadinejad 'won 
<br>big' in the first round. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Why the fix? In retrospect, many of the reasons seem clear. 
<br>Part of the answer could relate to SLK's desire to have unified 
<br>control over the three branches of government to strengthen Iran's 
<br>hand, and his hand personally, in expected upcoming negotiations 
<br>with the West and the US over nuclear issues.  More certainly, part 
<br>of the answer is that after the 1997-2005 Khatami Presidency, 
<br>Supreme Leader Khamenei (SLK) was determined to prevent any 
<br>reformist, especially his former political opponent Mousavi, from 
<br>heading the Executive Branch.  SLK considers Rafsanjani his most 
<br>serious rival, and is also intimidated by Khatami's popularity. 
<br>Therefore, that both Rafsanjani and Khatami supported Mousavi may 
<br>have led SLK to conclude that a Mousavi victory would consolidate 
<br>power in the hands of those bitter rivals and leave him 
<br>unacceptably vulnerable to marginalization.  And part of the answer 
<br>relates to the increasingly powerful IRGC hardline faction that had 
<br>supported Ahmadinejad (AN) in 2005, whose support AN strengthened 
<br>over the subsequent four years by using government funds and 
<br>patronage to increase this faction's power and wealth. As such, 
<br>this hardline IRGC faction, composed mostly of high-level officers 
<br>with a shared intelligence-security background, wanted 'four more 
<br>years,' despite mixed support for AN from within the IRGC ranks. 
<br>Anecdotal information indicates that this hardline faction had 
<br>convinced SLK that the election could be fixed with minimal 
<br>backlash. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) They were wrong, as shown by the unprecedented sight of 
<br>millions of ordinary Iranians pouring into the streets chanting 
<br>'where is my vote.' On June 19, SLK abandoned his carefully 
<br>cultivated pretense of non-partisanship and took the first steps 
<br>down the long road of post-election suppression when he lauded the 
<br>'epic' June 12 vote and told those disputing the results to stop 
<br>protesting and fall in line or face the consequences.  In response, 
<br>what started as the pre-election 'Green Movement' slowly began 
<br>changing into the 'Green Path of Hope' Opposition (GPO), as 
<br>reformist leaders Mousavi, Karrubi and Khatami signaled that they 
<br>would not stand down. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) REGIME RESPONSE:  Regime reaction to ongoing post-election 
<br>GPO activity was swift, conducted at both the popular and elite 
<br>level: 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- At the elite level the regime began a widespread intimidation 
<br>campaign to include Stalinesque show trials, rounding up not only 
<br>'all the usual suspects' (i.e. first-tier reformists, primarily 
<br>those associated with Khatami's 'Second of Khordad' movement), but 
<br>also their family members, in addition to second-tier reformists, 
<br>political and human rights activists, and reporters.  Many if not 
<br>most of these detained, to include those arrests that garnered the 
<br>most publicity in the West, played no significant role in either 
<br>promoting  Mousavi's candidacy or in engendering post-election 
<br>protests.  However anecdotal evidence indicates there have been 
<br>extensive arrests of younger, lesser-known activists more active in 
<br>the GPO.   Within the regime, SLK acted quickly to bring into line 
<br>as many key power brokers as possible, including traditional 
<br>conservatives like Majlis Speaker Larijani, former IRGC commander 
<br>(and defeated Presidential candidate) Mohsen Rezai, and Tehran 
<br>Mayor Qalibaf - all of whom oppose Ahmadinejad and would have been 
<br>happy to see him go, but whose loyalty to the System and to the 
<br>Leader trumped concerns they may have had about the extent of the 
<br>voting fraud. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- At the popular level the regime increasingly resorted to force on 
<br>those public holidays when GPO supporters took to the streets. The 
<br>following were the key dates on which the GPO took to the streets: 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000013  003 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-- 20 June 2009:  The day after SLK's gauntlet-throwing Friday 
<br>Prayer speech saw several hundred thousand Iranians march in Tehran 
<br>to protest, and also witnessed the first significant use of regime 
<br>force against protestors.  The killing of one young marcher, Neda 
<br>Agha Soltani, captured on video, focused global attention on the 
<br>protests and gave the GPO a tragic but iconic image of martyrdom to 
<br>wield against the regime. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>   -- June 28, 2009 (7th of Tir): The first time the GPO used the 
<br>cover of an officially sanctioned ceremony to rally against the 
<br>government.  GPO supporters, led by a key Mousavi aide, caught 
<br>security forces off guard by taking over an annual ceremony to mark 
<br>the 1981 bombing that killed several leaders of the Revolution. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>   -- July 17, 2009: The first and only time since June 12 when 
<br>former President Rafsanjani, in many ways the main target of 
<br>hardline regime animus, was allowed to give the Tehran Friday 
<br>Prayer sermon.  Rafsanjani's much anticipated speech, in which he 
<br>did not acquiesce to the official election results, energized 
<br>opposition supporters and led to street clashes. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>   -- September 18, 2009 (Ghods Day): The government-orchestrated 
<br>event to demonstrate solidarity with Palestinians was co-opted by 
<br>hundreds of thousands of GPO supporters flaunting green and 
<br>chanting anti-government slogans.  Ghods Day was the zenith of the 
<br>GPO's ability to bring significant number to the streets, and the 
<br>last time when security forces by and large eschewed violence; 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>   -- November 4, 2009 (US Embassy Takeover Anniversary): The GPO 
<br>hoped to replicate Ghods Day during the first large-scale protest 
<br>since university campuses reopened. Increasingly ominous warnings 
<br>from the security forces and revelations of detainee abuse resulted 
<br>in smaller GPO turnout, and more violent clashes than previously; 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>   -- December 27, 2009 (Ashura and 7th Mourning Day for Grand 
<br>Ayatollah Montazeri): Ashura witnessed the most violent clashes 
<br>since June 20, with at least nine killed.  Violent clashes also 
<br>took place in major cities outside of Tehran. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>II. WHERE WE ARE NOW 
<br> 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) WHAT IS THE OPPOSITION: Up to now the GPO's most significant 
<br>tool of resistance is popular turnout in the form of peaceful 
<br>marching and civil disobedience on those holidays when the regime 
<br>cannot prevent people taking to the streets. However, ongoing 
<br>regime violence against protesters has decreased GPO turnout, from 
<br>the millions of June 15 to a smaller committed core of (at most) 
<br>hundreds of thousands. Much if not most of them are young, 
<br>college-age Iranians, and understandably the vast majority of 
<br>opposition turnout appears to have been in Tehran, although other 
<br>major urban centers have also seen sporadic unrest. Although the 
<br>number of GPO'ers willing to take to the streets has decreased from 
<br>the days immediately following the June election, those remaining 
<br>on the streets seem to have radicalized, with at least some 
<br>opposition animus from AN to SLK: the new emblematic chant is no 
<br>longer 'where is my vote' but 'death to the dictator (i.e. SLK).' 
<br>At the elite level, not only are Mousavi, Karrubi and Khatami the 
<br>focus on hardline regime pressure, but former President Rafsanjani 
<br>is under ongoing attack by these same forces. 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000013  004 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) The GPO has a strong 'brand' - green, freedom, peace signs, 
<br>silent marches, stolen election and martyrs like Neda Agha Soltani. 
<br>But like the regime that seeks to crush it, the GPO is not 
<br>monolithic. To characterize the GPO's active core as now primarily 
<br>(but not exclusively) university students and university-age youth 
<br>in a country so demographically young (for example, approximately 
<br>one quarter of the population is in its twenties) is not to 
<br>belittle its potential.  Outside of the active GPO core group there 
<br>is a larger, relatively passive group, whose support now mostly 
<br>manifests in the anonymous shouts of 'God is Great' from night-time 
<br>North Tehran rooftops or who scrawl or stamp anti-regime slogans on 
<br>ten thousand Toman currency notes. Presumably many of them have 
<br>fled the field due to fear of regime reprisal but might be drawn 
<br>back into the fray if the prospects of a GPO victory, however 
<br>defined, became more real to them than the prospect of blows from a 
<br>Basiji baton. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) OTHER OPPOSITIONS: Stepping back, it is wrong to assume 
<br>that the GPO is the logical equivalent of 'the Iranian opposition,' 
<br>and indeed it is more accurate to speak of many different Iranian 
<br>oppositions, each with different constituents and goals, to include 
<br>the following: 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- BUREAUCRACY: AN has effected vast bureaucratic top-down Executive 
<br>branch personnel changes, ignoring the technocratic cadre that was 
<br>the recruitment pool for the Rafsanjani and Khatami presidencies. 
<br>Given his preference for ideology over expertise ('mota'hed' versus 
<br>'motakhasses'), he has staffed his government largely from within 
<br>the current and former IRGC ranks.  Many of these former ministers, 
<br>deputy ministers, office heads and other senior bureaucrats have 
<br>not been pleased with their professional fates.  At lower 
<br>government levels, there is anecdotal evidence of widespread 
<br>disgruntlement with if not opposition to AN. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>-MILITARY/INTELLIGENCE: AN and his hardline IRGC backers have 
<br>extensively purged the Intelligence Ministry on the grounds of 
<br>partisan loyalty, creating a significant cadre of disgruntled 
<br>former Intelligence Ministry officials. Similarly, there is 
<br>evidence of at least some IRGC opposition, both within the rank and 
<br>file and also the upper ranks, at SLK's handling of the election 
<br>and post-election events. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- INDUSTRIALISTS: AN's massive economic mismanagement and the 
<br>ongoing economic power grab of 'IRGC Incorporated' has engendered 
<br>much ill will among Iran's affluent and influential industrial 
<br>leaders. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- RAFSANJANI/CLERGY: Rafsanjani's institutional power is minimal, 
<br>but as part of his strategy he seeks to retain/expand his support 
<br>within Iran's clerical class, although this class itself is 
<br>increasingly impotent and dependent on government favor .  As one 
<br>element of the regime's efforts to limit the pro-GPO clergy's 
<br>influence, it has taken steps in recent weeks to challenge the 
<br>religious titles and credentials of at least one top-level 
<br>reformist cleric ("Grand Ayatollah").  This move will not likely 
<br>endear the regime to many if not most Iranian traditional 
<br>seminarians who take matters of religious credentials, learning, 
<br>and hierarchy very seriously, especially given SLK's own lack of 
<br>qualifications for his religious title. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>- 'MODERATE' PRINCIPLISTS: Within the ruling conservative 
<br>'Principlist' ('Osulgarayan') grouping there is a significant 
<br>faction opposing AN, though still quite loyal to SLK and the 
<br>concept of 'Supreme Jurisconsulate.' One of this faction's leaders 
<br>is Majlis Speaker Ali Larijani, with the Majlis as a whole in an 
<br>ongoing battle with AN's increasingly 'imperial' Executive Branch. 
<br>Other major Principlist opponents are Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher 
<br>Qalibaf and Expediency Council Secretary Mohsen Rezai. 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000013  005 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>GPO LEADERSHIP- STREET 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) The GPO has promulgated a new mode of oppositionist 
<br>organization for Iran.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that GPO 
<br>leaders, especially Mousavi, have from the start favored a 
<br>horizontal, diffuse, decentralized GPO structure as opposed to a 
<br>more hierarchical one.   Indeed, part of the GPO's resilience stems 
<br>from this defuse and decentralized nature, frustrating a regime 
<br>that has come to rely on the two-step of identifying and 
<br>decapitating leadership as its main tool for extinguishing dissent. 
<br>In this regard communication technologies such as the Internet and 
<br>SMS technology have been a significant 'force multiplier,' with 
<br>virtual space in many ways playing the same 'information-center' 
<br>role now that the networks of mosques played in the 1979 
<br>Revolution.  GPO leaders Karrubi, Mousavi and Khatami play a role 
<br>both symbolic and also operational, with anecdotal evidence 
<br>indicating that they are playing at least a limited role in 
<br>coordinating with if not leading the GPO masses.   Additionally, 
<br>for the first time since the Revolution elements of the Iranian 
<br>Diaspora seem to be playing a role within events in Iran, 
<br>coordinating with GPO leadership elements inside the country. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Distance between the titular GPO leadership and the street 
<br>may yield tactical advantages, though it also reflects a gulf 
<br>between the leadership and the popular opposition. Mousavi, 
<br>Karrubi, and Khatami are longstanding fixtures of the Islamic 
<br>Republic, making them ill suited to lead a radicalizing movement 
<br>calling for the overthrow of that system.  Certainly they retain 
<br>support from the broader opposition, but many, and particularly the 
<br>more radicalized elements, do not look to Mousavi et al for 
<br>leadership.  In particular, IRPO contacts in their 20s and 30s 
<br>discount the notion that anyone previously associated with 'the 
<br>Nezam' ('the System') could accurately represent their interests 
<br>and aspirations.  The regime, however, has proved particularly 
<br>effective at neutralizing emerging leaders from the post-Revolution 
<br>generations. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Within the GPO there is no consensus on its goals. What 
<br>started as a movement merely to annul the election results now 
<br>gives shelter both to those seeking the full set of rights 
<br>guaranteed them by Islamic Iran's Constitution and others seeking a 
<br>new system of governance altogether.   Much like the ambiguity in 
<br>its leadership, the unspecified nature of its goals allow it to 
<br>have a 'bigger tent.'  Mousavi's recent five point declaration 
<br>calling for restoring press freedom, creating a fair and 
<br>transparent election law, freeing all political prisoners, and 
<br>recognizing the peoples' right to gather and to form political 
<br>associations and parties, was however an attempt by the GPO 
<br>leaderships to to begin to delimit the scope of their ambitions. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) Heretofore the GPO has yet to adopt any sort of an economic 
<br>agenda or set of grievances as part of a core opposition message, 
<br>and perhaps the absence of one partially underscores the relative 
<br>'bourgeois' leanings of the GPO.   Anecdotal information indicates 
<br>that unemployment and a potential spike in inflation (expected with 
<br>the recent decision to end subsidies) increasingly concern a large 
<br>number of Iranians.  IRPO contacts and Iranian press reporting also 
<br>indicate another spike in labor unrest, due to the parlous state of 
<br>Iran's factories and their inability to pay their workers on time. 
<br>One would think that a message that capitalizes on these economic 
<br>concerns juxtaposed against President Ahmadinejad's (and by 
<br>extension the Revolution's) economic mismanagement and continued 
<br>corruption would attract a wide spectrum of socio-economic groups 
<br>to a more broad-based GPO.  However, for whatever reason, in 
<br>contemporary Iran it has been political and not economic themes 
<br>that have been more effective in mobilizing the Iranian people, and 
<br>economic concerns on their own have rarely drawn large protests in 
<br>Iran's thirty-year post-revolutionary history. 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000013  006 OF 006 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (U) COMMENT:  The June 12 election and its subsequent 
<br>protests/crackdown was a tectonic shift in Iranian domestic 
<br>politics.  At the elite level it destroyed Khamenei's non-partisan 
<br>veneer, placing him securely in the center of a no holds-barred 
<br>political fray.  It also redefined the sets of insider ('khodi') 
<br>and outsider ('qeyr-e khodi') so that not only were Second of 
<br>Khordad Reformists on the outs, but so was former President Hashemi 
<br>Rafsanjani and those aligned with him.  In this regard, at the 
<br>elite level the central dynamic in many ways can be seen as Supreme 
<br>Leader Khamenei, AN and the hard-line intelligence-security IRGC 
<br>faction on one side and former President  Rafsanjani on the other, 
<br>with all of Iran's political elite being pressured to openly take 
<br>sides (NOTE: there is a substantial economic element to this 
<br>dynamic, as in many ways Ahmadinejad's ascension to power coincides 
<br>with attempts by a new cohort elite, largely composed of hardline 
<br>IRGC 'intelligence-security' elements, to secure positions of 
<br>wealth and influence formerly occupied by Rafsanjani loyalists). 
<br>Certainly many hardline regime elements see Rafsanjani and his 
<br>eldest son Mehdi as the 'head' to the GPO 'body,' and assume that 
<br>if Rafsanjani were neutralized then the GPO's threat potential 
<br>would be far less. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶17.  (C) COMMENT (CONT): According to IRPO contacts close to the 
<br>Rafsanjani circle, Rafsanjani is still unsuccessfully seeking to 
<br>persuade Supreme Leader Khamenei that AN and his crowd are a far 
<br>greater threat to the Islamic Republic than any threat that 
<br>Khamenei might feel from Rafsanjani, and that SLK should withdraw 
<br>his support for them.  For their part, the regime continues to 
<br>pressure Rafsanjani through (inter alia) judicial and other 
<br>pressure on his family, such that his eldest son Mehdi has fled 
<br>abroad and cannot return.  A weakened Rafsanjani has minimal 
<br>institutional power, given that the Expediency Council is 
<br>subordinate to Khamenei and that the clerics in the Experts Council 
<br>are too cowed or beholden to the government to oppose them.  As 
<br>such, Rafsanjani keeps a low public profile while at the same time 
<br>trying to rally elite support, to include moderate conservatives 
<br>and influential IRGC commanders.  The regime is unlikely to more 
<br>directly target Rafsanjani unless and until Rafsanjani were to 
<br>become more confrontational.

<br>¶18. (C) COMMENT (CONT): At the popular level, June 12 has revived a 
<br>popular reformist movement largely quiescent after the eight 
<br>Khatami years while also bringing large parts of  Iran's youngest 
<br>generation into the fray.   This opposition, however, is not 
<br>unified. The GPO now is a bifurcated movement, coupling a largely 
<br>student-dominated mass following with a titular, elite leadership, 
<br>and the two parts are not a cohesive whole.  This rather diffuse 
<br>organization may be a key to its staying power and simultaneously 
<br>an impediment to building an opposition movement that could 
<br>challenge the viability of the current government.   Beyond the GPO 
<br>is an array of unsatisfied groups whose willingness to join the GPO 
<br>is unclear.  These groups clearly oppose President Ahmadinejad but 
<br>do not yet seek, as do many GPO elements, to overturn the entire 
<br>system.  END COMMENT.
