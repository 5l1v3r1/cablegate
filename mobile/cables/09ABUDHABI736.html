<br>SUBJECT: CROWN PRINCE SOUNDS ALARM ON IRAN 
<br> 
<br>Classified by Ambassador Richard Olson, reasons 1.4 (b, d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (U) This cable contains an action request in para 12. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Summary. On July 15, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner 
<br>joined Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan 
<br>(MBZ) and Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al Nahyan (ABZ) 
<br>for a dinner covering a range of regional issues.  MBZ expressed 
<br>serious concern over Iran's regional intentions and pleaded for the 
<br>U.S. to shorten its decision-making timeline and develop a "plan B." 
<br>He encouraged the U.S. to clearly communicate 'red lines' to the 
<br>Iranian Government, on nuclear and regional stability issues, with 
<br>direct consequences for transgressions.  He painted to a nuclear Iran 
<br>as an existential threat to the UAE and invoked the well being of his 
<br>grandchildren while urging the U.S. to act quickly.  MBZ asked for 
<br>close coordination between the U.S. and UAE to deal with the Iranian 
<br>threat. End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Secretary Geithner asked the Crown Prince for his views on 
<br>the situation in the region, particularly in Iran.  Geithner 
<br>described the U.S. strategy on Iran, including our intention to move 
<br>forward with multilateral financial sanctions while waiting for Iran 
<br>to decide on its engagement with the U.S.   He also conveyed 
<br>appreciation for the important support that UAE provides to other 
<br>regional trouble spots. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) MBZ described a nuclear armed Iran as absolutely untenable. 
<br> He pointed to Iran's relentless ambitions to restore regional 
<br>hegemony as evidenced by destabilizing interference in Iraq, Lebanon, 
<br>Afghanistan and Palestine.  He believes that 'all hell will break 
<br>loose' if Iran attains the bomb, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and 
<br>Turkey developing their own nuclear weapons capability and Iran 
<br>instigating Sunni - Shia conflict throughout the world.  He said Iran 
<br>is surrounding Israel - driven by ideological conviction - and will 
<br>threaten Israel's existence should it go nuclear.  At the same time, 
<br>he described Iran's ambitions as reflecting a desire to restore 
<br>Persia's great-power status, rather than driven by religious 
<br>convictions. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S/NF) MBZ differentiated the long term threat posed by Iran from 
<br>other menacing states like North Korea or Syria.  Where these other 
<br>regimes were ruled by small cadres of corrupt 'old guard' officials, 
<br>the Iranian regime has raised its next generation to carry out its 
<br>designs for hegemony.  As such, the world will be dealing with Iran's 
<br>destabilizing ambitions for decades.  MBZ assesses that the Iranian 
<br>regime has emerged from the recent election strife stronger and more 
<br>resolute. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S/NF) While careful not to suQY.JQoWoRth Iran, 
<br>MBZ described a near term conventional war with Iran as clearly 
<br>preferable to the long term consequences of a nuclear armed Iran. 
<br>Without timely and decisive action by the United States, MBZ believes 
<br>that Israel will strike Iran, causing Iran to launch missile attacks 
<br>- including hits on the UAE -  and to unleash terror attacks 
<br>worldwide. In his view, 'the map of the Middle East' would change. 
<br>He expects widespread civilian conflict to erupt as Iran sparks Sunni 
<br>- Shia violence worldwide (including the Eastern Province of Saudi 
<br>Arabia which he sees as the greatest vulnerability, along with Iraq, 
<br>in the Arab world).  He speculated that such an event could unfold 
<br>within six months time and resolved that the UAE is prepared to 
<br>defend itself.  He believes that an Israeli strike will not be 
<br>successful in stopping Iran's nuclear program, and therefore we need 
<br>to plan. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Regarding the recent election in Iran, MBZ cautioned that 
<br>Mir Hossein Musavi is no different than Ahmedinejad when it comes to 
<br>their nuclear ambitions, 'same goal, different tactic.'  In this 
<br>respect, he regards Musavi as more dangerous than his competitor, as 
<br>at least Ahmedinejad was 'an open book.'  He reminded Secretary 
<br>Geithner that Musavi and his advisors are part of the same group that 
<br>took the U.S. Embassy in 1979. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S/NF) MBZ questioned Europe's basic understanding of the threat 
<br>posed by Iran, and wrote off their resolve to deal with the 
<br>situation.  He was appalled by 'top European diplomats' that were 
<br>unconcerned by the possibility of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. He 
<br>shared his theory that Russia was trying to instigate conflict 
<br>between the U.S. and Iran as a means to weaken the U.S. and drive up 
<br>oil prices.  He suggested we could use Russia's narrow views to help 
<br>persuade Russia to join international actions against Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S/NF) MBZ stated that financial sanctions would never be 
<br>sufficient to stop Iran, but allowed that the U.S. should continue 
<br>with such measures to demonstrate to the Arab world that we tried 
<br>everything.  He pledged continued cooperation and support for 
<br>international sanctions and encouraged further action in the UN and 
<br>EU, as well as the U.S. 
<br>¶10. (S/NF) MBZ suggested that the key to containing Iran revolves 
<br>around progress in the Israel/Palestine issue.  He argued that it 
<br>will be essential to bring Arab public opinion on board in any 
<br>conflict with Iran and roughly 80% of the public is amenable to 
<br>persuasion.  To win them over, the U.S. should quickly bring about a 
<br>two state solution over the objections of the Netanyahu government. 
<br>He suggested working with moderate Palestinians that support the road 
<br>map, and forget about the others as there is no time to waste. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Foreign Minister ABZ urged the U.S. to make better use of 
<br>its allies in the region and engage Russia and China in a productive 
<br>way on this issue wherever possible.  He urged clear and forceful 
<br>messaging to Iran and more regional gatherings (i.e. P+5+1 and GCC+3) 
<br>to increase pressure and isolation. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S/NF) ACTION REQUEST: MBZ would like to visit Washington in late 
<br>July to discuss Iran with President Obama and other senior officials. 
<br>Treasury and Embassy recommend continuing the dialogue with MBZ as 
<br>soon as possible. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (SBU) This cable has been cleared by Andy Baukol, Department of 
<br>Treasury Acting Assistant Secretary for International Affairs.
