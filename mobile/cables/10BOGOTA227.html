<br>SUBJECT: GOC CLAIMS SOME PROGRESS WITH FARC, ELN

<br>REF: BOGOTA 13 
<br> 
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Brian Nichols, Deputy Chief of Mission; REASON: 
<br>1.4(B), (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary:  Swedish intermediaries have reportedly arranged 
<br>for a meeting in Sweden between representatives of the Government 
<br>of Colombia (GOC) and representatives of the Revolutionary Armed 
<br>Forces of Colombia (FARC).  Separately, negotiations proceeded for 
<br>the humanitarian release of two military prisoners held by the 
<br>FARC.  The GOC and other observers believe opposition Senator 
<br>Piedad Cordoba engineered delays in the release to maximize impact 
<br>before the March 14 congressional elections.  The National 
<br>Liberation Army (ELN) also responded positively to a request for a 
<br>meeting, likely in Colombia, to discuss possible peace talks.  End 
<br>Summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>FARC Hints At Meeting in Sweden 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) High Commissioner for Peace Frank Pearl told Polcouns 
<br>February 4 that the Swedish Ambassador had relayed a positive 
<br>response by FARC leadership to a GOC offer to meet (reftel).  Pearl 
<br>said the information had been passed by an unidentified FARC member 
<br>living in Sweden via a former Swedish Ambassador to Colombia and 
<br>current head of the International Council of Swedish Industry 
<br>(NIR).  Pearl said in the message the FARC had agreed in principle 
<br>to a meeting between two GOC representatives and two members of the 
<br>High Command ("Estado Mayor"), but not with higher-ranking FARC 
<br>Secretariat members.  Pearl said he agreed to the meeting on the 
<br>condition that that FARC not appoint as one of its representatives 
<br>Southern Block Deputy Commander alias Fabian Ramirez, whom the GOC 
<br>considers a major narco-trafficker and criminal.  Pearl said he had 
<br>discussed with the Government of Sweden its facilitation of the 
<br>meeting, including the transportation of the FARC representatives 
<br>to Sweden.  Pearl presumed that the two representatives would be 
<br>among those FARC leaders residing in Venezuela, thus facilitating 
<br>their international travel.  (Note:  The current Swedish Ambassador 
<br>to Colombia did not mention these developments in a February 4 
<br>breakfast with the Ambassador.) 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Humanitarian Release Delayed By Electoral Politics 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Pearl confirmed rumors that the Government of Brazil had 
<br>agreed to facilitate the humanitarian release of Colombian soldiers 
<br>Pablo Moncayo (held by the FARC since December 1997) and Josue 
<br>Calvo (held since April 2009).  The FARC also agreed to deliver the 
<br>remains of Colombian Army major Julian Ernesto Guevara.  Pearl 
<br>discounted reports in December that the FARC had rejected Brazil in 
<br>favor of Argentina.  He pointed out that the message had come from 
<br>former president and left-wing Liberal Party official Ernesto 
<br>Samper.  Pearl theorized that Samper was working on behalf of 
<br>opposition senator Piedad Cordoba, who had been in contact with the 
<br>FARC over the releases.  Catholic Church peace envoy XXXXXXXXXXXX  
<br>complained to us on February 1 that Cordoba had been 
<br>manipulating the release date to place it nearer to the March 14 
<br>congressional elections.  Indeed, Cordoba told the press on 
<br>February 7 that she expected the releases to come at the end of 
<br>February.  XXXXXXXXXXXX lamented that Gustavo Moncayo, hostage 
<br>Moncayo's father and a Polo Democratico candidate for the Senate, 
<br>appeared complicit in this plan.  Pearl said the GOC plans to move 
<br>ahead regardless of dates, though International Commission for the 
<br>Red Cross country director Christophe Beney told us on February 8 
<br>that he fears the GOC will further delay the release so as not to 
<br>give Cordoba and Moncayo free campaign publicity.  Pearl publicly 
<br>echoed complaints of FARC political manipulation in February 10 
<br>remarks to the press, but said the GOC would cooperate with a 
<br>release nonetheless. 
<br> 
<br>ELN Also Accepts Meeting Offer 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) Pearl also reported that his offer for a meeting with the 
<br>ELN had been accepted.  He had yet to confirm a date or location, 
<br>though he expected the meeting would take place in the Colombia. 
<br>He said he was going to Medellin to meet with jailed ELN member 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX to discuss details.  As with the FARC, the 
<br>purpose of the meeting is to establish a line of communication that 
<br>could lead to a "roadmap" toward eventual peace talks.  Pearl's 
<br>hope is to have roadmaps on the ELN and FARC ready for the next 
<br>administration when it takes office in August.
