<br> 
<br>¶1.   Lead Stories Summary 
<br> 
<br>The majority of dailies opened with reports on the failed terror 
<br>attack on a Delta Airlines jet, while Sueddeutsche headlined: 
<br>"Protests Intensify - Riots in Iran" and FAZ led with the headline: 
<br> 
<br>"People Killed in Demonstrations in Iran."  Editorials focused on 
<br>the 
<br>failed terror attack in the U.S., with the unrest in Iran and with 
<br>the 
<br>state of the coalition government in Berlin.  ZDF-TV's early evening 
<br> 
<br>newscast heute and ARD-TV's early evening newscast Tagesschau opened 
<br> 
<br>with a report on violent clashes between the Iranian regime and 
<br>opponents. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.   (U.S.)   Failed Terrorist Attack 
<br> 
<br>All papers carry extensive reports the failed terrorist attack on a 
<br> 
<br>Delta Airlines airliners and reported that travelers flying to the 
<br>United States must expect heightened security measures and tougher 
<br>restrictions on their flights to the United States.  Die Welt 
<br>headlined: "Terror Attempt Stirring up fear of Terror," while 
<br>Financial Times headlined: "Fear of Terror is Back." 
<br> 
<br>In a front-page editorial, Die Welt (12/28) judged: "The fact that 
<br>the 
<br>would-be attacker was able to board a plane with his dangerous 
<br>material reveals gaps in the control system.  With metal detectors 
<br>alone chemical explosives cannot be discovered." 
<br> 
<br>Under the headline: "Flight 253," Frankfurter Allgemeine (12/28) 
<br>opined: "If someone really had believed that we have transnational 
<br>terror under control, and that we can give an all-clear signal with 
<br> 
<br>respect to security, then those people have now been taught better. 
<br> 
<br>Irrespective of whether the attacker acted on his own or on the 
<br>instructions of al-Qaida, the danger is not over and that is why 
<br>travelers, not only to the Untied States, must accept new 
<br>inconveniences which are hopefully useful." 
<br> 
<br>"Following the terror attempt in Detroit, the usual security debate 
<br> 
<br>will now begin," Frankfurter Rundschau (12/28) noted, and added: 
<br>"controls will be heightened, and agencies are trying to get us to 
<br>do 
<br>everything possible to prevent another attack.  This failed terror 
<br>attempt shows how unpredictable people can be who stop at nothing. 
<br> 
<br>For the time being, there is only one lesson we can learn from the 
<br>events on Flight 253: It is the courageous effort of Jasper 
<br>Schuringa 
<br>who prevented even worse events.  The unexpected resolve of 
<br>individuals can be the right answer to the threat that comes out of 
<br> 
<br>the blue." 
<br> 
<br>In the view of Stuttgarter Zeitung (12/28), "Abdulmutallab was miles 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001626  002 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>away from the organizational level of the 9/11 attackers.  But the 
<br>Nigerian national succeeded in one thing:  he totally unnerved the 
<br>western world, and the terror fighting machinery of the United 
<br>States 
<br>in particular.  Even though the U.S. government knew about the 
<br>danger 
<br>of the young man, he was able to fly around the world without 
<br>difficulty.  Almost without any problems, he was able to smuggle 
<br>dangerous substances aboard an aircraft.  But what if he really had 
<br> 
<br>the order from al-Qaida in Yemen to blow up the plane?  How does 
<br>this 
<br>view then fit the U.S. focus on Afghanistan?  Is Yemen, too, a front 
<br> 
<br>in the anti-terror war?  Many question, but only a few answers." 
<br> 
<br>Regional daily Nrnberger Nachrichten (12/28) and regional daily 
<br>Trierischer Volksfreund (12/28) judged: "How was it possible for a 
<br>young man to get aboard with a one-way ticket and an Arabic sounding 
<br> 
<br>name, whose contacts with Islamic extremists were known and whose 
<br>father even warned the U.S. embassy?  The lists of passengers 
<br>travelling to the United States are transferred in advance to the 
<br>U.S. 
<br>Homeland Security Department with all its data bases.  But again we 
<br> 
<br>see a big hole in the net that is supposed to capture potential 
<br>terrorists.  Of course, one hundred percent security will never 
<br>exist, 
<br>but these gaps are dramatic and should be an alarm call which 
<br>politicians should not ignore." 
<br> 
<br>Mannheimer Morgen (12/28) warned against hysteria and judged: "Each 
<br> 
<br>day terror investigators receive hundreds of tips and indications. 
<br> 
<br>How is it then possible to follow a vague suspicion?  We should not 
<br> 
<br>exaggerate security measures for flights.  The fact that in the 
<br>United 
<br>States no one is allowed to go to the bathroom one hour before 
<br>landing 
<br>is ridiculous.  The same is true for the ban on liquids in Europe. 
<br> 
<br>Here there is a clear disproportion between cost and benefit." 
<br>MQrkische Allgemeine of Potsdam (12/28) opined: "If airlines, as a 
<br>reaction to the failed attempt, force their passengers to remain 
<br>seated one hour before landing, then this is no more than a gesture 
<br>of 
<br>helplessness.  The second much more important aspect may be 
<br>dissatisfying at the moment, but there is no way around it: Muslims 
<br> 
<br>must preach again and again in their own ranks that terror is not 
<br>the 
<br>culmination of piety but a crime.  Any incident like this should 
<br>stress to the Muslim world how urgent this message is." 
<br> 
<br>Regional daily Westdeutsche Zeitung of Dsseldorf (12/28) observed: 
<br> 
<br>"Hectic measure such as barring passengers from getting up should 
<br>not 
<br>prevail in the long run.  In the future, there will be no way around 
<br> 
<br>finding the right balance between possible improvements of our 
<br>security standards compared to the trouble caused by 
<br>them."SchwarzwQlder Bote (12/28) noted: "Everything we have learned 
<br> 
<br>about this attack does not strengthen our confidence in 
<br>international 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001626  003 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>security measures.  It is certainly right that there cannot be 
<br>absolute security from mean terrorist attacks but this does not the 
<br> 
<br>least excuse the gaps in anti-terror measures. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.   (Iran)   New Protests 
<br> 
<br>All papers carry extensive coverage of the new clashes between the 
<br>regime and opposition forces in Iran.   Sueddeutsche headlined: 
<br>"Protests Intensify - Riots in Iran" and FAZ led with the headline: 
<br> 
<br>"People Killed in Demonstrations in Iran."  Frankfurter Rundschau 
<br>reported on its front page: "The protests are directed against 
<br>Iranian 
<br>President Ahmadinejad."  The paper also reported that "according to 
<br> 
<br>reports from Tehran, police officers partly disobeyed orders to use 
<br> 
<br>their guns against the protesters.  The Internet page "Jaras," which 
<br> 
<br>is critical of the government, reported that 'some [police officers] 
<br> 
<br>tried to fire their guns in the air when their superiors put 
<br>pressure 
<br>on them.'" 
<br> 
<br>Sueddeutsche Zeitung (12/28) said in an editorial under the 
<br>headline: 
<br>"There is Growing Unrest among the People" that "if the information 
<br> 
<br>fragments from Tehran on the demonstrations during the Ashura 
<br>holidays 
<br>allow one conclusion, then this one: the rank and file of the 
<br>protests 
<br>are now overtaking their leaders.  Posters of religious leader Ali 
<br>Khamenei and the chorus of demonstrators who want to see the 
<br>dictator 
<br>dead do not correspond with the slogans of the two opposition 
<br>leaders 
<br>Moussawi and Charrubi.  They are now faced with a dilemma:  If they 
<br> 
<br>stick to their view that they, in principle, recognize the 
<br>institutions of the Islamic republic and want to use the courts to 
<br>make their political opposition heard, then it could be that their 
<br>followers will leave them because many want something else: regime 
<br>change." 
<br> 
<br>Regional daily Suedwest Presse of Ulm (12/28) editorialized: "The 
<br>regime is using all its might to extinguish the massive protests. 
<br>The 
<br>few Internet reports in any case show the brutality of the leading 
<br>clique around President Ahmadinejad.  In the meantime, the regime 
<br>has 
<br>its back to the wall.  The protests are no longer confined to Tehran 
<br> 
<br>but are spreading to other cities....  The government can no longer 
<br> 
<br>afford the good deeds with which it bought the loyalty of Iranians. 
<br> 
<br>All this is really worrying for the international community of 
<br>nations." 
<br> 
<br>Ostsee Zeitung of Rostock (12/28) argued: "Despite jammed cellular 
<br>phone networks and despite blocked access to the Internet, the 
<br>unrest 
<br>in Iran hardly seems to be stoppable.  The resistance is still 
<br>limited 
<br>to a well-educated cosmopolitan, young, urban middle class.  Large 
<br>sectors of the population, however, seem to keep quiet or seem to 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001626  004 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>support the regime.  But the cyber revolt in Tehran has demonstrated 
<br> 
<br>that the mullahs no longer enjoy a monolithic power." 
<br> 
<br>Regional daily Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten (12/28) opined: "Since 
<br>the 
<br>allegedly manipulated re-election of President Ahmadinejad, a state 
<br>of 
<br>emergency has dominated in Iran.  But this is not only the struggle 
<br>of 
<br>a limited political protest movement against the president and the 
<br>ayatollahs behind him.  The country is now facing an endurance test. 
<br> 
<br>At issue is whether the country wants to become a fundamental 
<br>religious state or an Islamic republic.   The pictures from Iran are 
<br> 
<br>shocking.  It is the violence on both sides that makes us fear the 
<br>worst." 
<br> 
<br>¶4.   (China)   Reaction to Jailing of Liu Xiabo 
<br> 
<br>Frankfurter Allgemeine (12/28) editorialized under the headline: 
<br>"Co- 
<br>Responsibility," that foreign countries must also be blamed that a 
<br>man 
<br>like Liu Xiabo is jailed with such an absurdly high prison term. 
<br>The 
<br>foreign countries have treated China for economic considerations 
<br>with 
<br>political kid gloves for years.  We can't blame China under these 
<br>circumstances because we think that it is unassailable?  A positive 
<br> 
<br>reaction to any criticism of the verdict cannot be expected." 
<br> 
<br>Sueddeutsche Zeitung (12/28) said in an editorial: "A subtle but 
<br>clearly visible trend is getting hold in China.  Civil disobedience 
<br> 
<br>among the rank and file is spreading.  It is an irony that this tend 
<br> 
<br>has become visible in the tough verdict against Liu Xiabo.  In front 
<br> 
<br>of the court in which China's leadership organized the show trial, 
<br>we 
<br>could not only see international reporters and diplomats, but 
<br>Chinese 
<br>supporters of Liu shouted slogans and unrolled posters thus 
<br>deliberately risking their arrest.  Only a few courageous people 
<br>went 
<br>to the court, but they showed that intimidation no longer works as 
<br>successfully as in the past.  This new trend is not only confined to 
<br> 
<br>the traditional political protest.  Courageous lawyers of the 
<br>Weiquan 
<br>civil rights movement are defending victims of the arbitrariness of 
<br> 
<br>state agencies and they defend each other, too.  And the number of 
<br>peaceful and violent civil protests is on the rise.  But the Chinese 
<br> 
<br>Communist Party fails miserably when it comes to channeling 
<br>communication with its critics into a constructive direction.  The 
<br>verdict against Liu Xiabo is one more example.  It will only 
<br>partially 
<br>obtain the desired effect but not intimidate the people.  At the 
<br>same 
<br>time, new embitterment, new disobedience is growing.  With each show 
<br> 
<br>trial, the party is now doing of what it is accusing Liu: it 
<br>undermines the state's authority." 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00001626  005 OF 005 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5.   (U.S.)   Healthcare Reform 
<br> 
<br>Under the headline: "Reform Blues," Sueddeutsche Zeitung (12/28) had 
<br> 
<br>this to say: "There is no doubt that the healthcare reform bill that 
<br> 
<br>has now been adopted in the Senate is a great work...and 
<br>trailblazing. 
<br>But enthusiasm about the success is limited.  One reason is that the 
<br> 
<br>legislative process is so tiresome; but there is an even more 
<br>important reason: disappointment and doubts are spreading.  The 
<br>advocates of the reform have been brought down to earth again 
<br>because 
<br>they were able to implement only a few of their demands.   Thus far, 
<br> 
<br>the Democrats have lost the fight for public opinion.  They will 
<br>have 
<br>to do quite a lot in the election campaign in 2010 to avoid being 
<br>punished for a reasonable reform." 
<br> 
<br>Die Welt (12/28) argued: "The Democrats will now have difficulty 
<br>explaining to their irritated voters why it is historic progress 
<br>that 
<br>31 million compatriots who have no coverage today will get health 
<br>insurance, and that health insurance companies can no longer reject 
<br> 
<br>sick Americans or demand astronomically high premiums.  This reform 
<br>is 
<br>supposed to carry itself and not burden the budget.  But the 
<br>opponents 
<br>to the bill do not believe a word, arguing that the nation will go 
<br>bankrupt.  This is a highly imperfect, weakened bill and, at the 
<br>same 
<br>time, a giant step forward into an American future in which job loss 
<br> 
<br>no longer means the end of insurance protection for a former 
<br>employee 
<br>and their whole family."
