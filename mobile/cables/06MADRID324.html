<br>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND UNION LEADER DISCUSS VENEZUELA,
<br>LABOR ISSUES
<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) During a February 6 courtesy call by the Ambassador,
<br>Worker's General Union (UGT) Secretary General Candido Mendez
<br>expressed concern that the USG decision to deny authorization
<br>to transfer U.S. components as part of Spain's deal to sell
<br>EADS CASA aircraft to Venezuela could cost Spain important
<br>jobs in the defense industry. Mendez said the more important
<br>contract was for the construction of the naval vessels by
<br>shipbuilder "Navantia," but that the 12 EADS CASA aircraft
<br>still represented a valuable contract that could now be lost.
<br>Mendez noted that the UGT, Spain's largest union and
<br>historically a close ally of the Socialist Party, was no
<br>friend of the Chavez government. He said the UGT had taken a
<br>strong stand in defense of Venezuela's CVT labor union,
<br>leading Chavez to expel the UGT representative in Caracas.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The Ambassador explained that the USG decision was
<br>based on our growing concerns regarding the direction of the
<br>Venezuelan government and was not aimed at Spain. He said
<br>the USG had laid out its concerns to the Spanish government
<br>in great detail over many months and was disappointed that
<br>Spain had concluded an agreement with Chavez nonetheless.
<br>The Ambassador noted that EADS CASA -- and the unions -- had
<br>more to gain commercially by pursuing contracts with the USG
<br>and other governments than through a relationship with the
<br>Chavez government. Regarding the naval vessels, the
<br>Ambassador said the Spanish government had assured the USG
<br>that there would be no U.S. components involved. However, if
<br>there did turn out to be U.S. components on the vessels, the
<br>USG would look very carefully at any associated technology
<br>transfer request.
<br>
<br>//SPAIN LABOR ISSUES//
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Mendez outlined his three priorities as leader of the
<br>UGT: the prevalence of temporary employment contracts as
<br>opposed to permanent positions, high unemployment among
<br>youth, and a high unemployment rate among women. Mendez said
<br>the issue of Spain's low population growth rate was being
<br>resolved through increased immigration, though he
<br>acknowledged that immigration was generating its own set of
<br>challenges. He took credit for the Zapatero government's
<br>2005 amnesty of illegal immigrants, saying the UGT had
<br>quietly proposed the measure as the only way to resolve the
<br>abuses typical of employment in the informal sector. Mendez
<br>said the UGT had borrowed directly from the recent strategy
<br>of the AFL-CIO in welcoming immigrant labor as a new source
<br>of members (NOTE: only 18 percent of the Spanish labor force
<br>is unionized. END NOTE). He said the UGT had conciously
<br>selected a North African immigrant woman to head its
<br>Immigrant Affairs office to send a message to potential new
<br>members.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) Mendez was friendly and gregarious in his meeting
<br>with the Ambassador and clearly wanted to establish a good
<br>relationship. He did not raise the UGT's strong opposition
<br>to the war in Iraq or his organization of massive rallies
<br>against the war, even when the discussion turned to the
<br>danger posed by extremist veteran jihadists of that conflict
<br>returning to their homes in Europe. Mendez seemed satisfied
<br>by the Ambassador's explanation on the EADS CASA aircraft
<br>issue, though he was obviously concerned by the possibility
<br>of delays in the execution of the ship deal. Doubtless he
<br>recalled the violent strikes carried out by shipyard workers
<br>across Spain when the Navantia's predecessor, IZAR, was
<br>forced to trim jobs in response to a business slowdown. For
<br>Mendez and other union leaders, the possibility of retaining
<br>hundreds of jobs in this failing industry overshadows any
<br>qualms they may have about dealing with Chavez.
