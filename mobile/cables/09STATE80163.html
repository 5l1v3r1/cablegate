<br>SUBJECT: (S) REPORTING AND COLLECTION NEEDS: THE UNITED
<br>NATIONS
<br>
<br>REF: STATE 048489
<br>
<br>Classified By: MICHAEL OWENS, ACTING DIR, INR/OPS. REASON: 1.4(C).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) This cable provides the full text of the new
<br>National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) on the United
<br>Nations (paragraph 3-end) as well as a request for continued
<br>DOS reporting of biographic information relating to the
<br>United Nations (paragraph 2).
<br>
<br>¶A. (S/NF) The NHCD below supercedes the 2004 NHCD and
<br>reflects the results of a recent Washington review of
<br>reporting and collection needs focused on the United Nations.
<br>The review produced a comprehensive list of strategic
<br>priorities (paragraph 3) and reporting and collection needs
<br>(paragraph 4) intended to guide participating USG agencies as
<br>they allocate resources and update plans to collect
<br>information on the United Nations. The priorities should
<br>also serve as a useful tool to help the Embassy manage
<br>reporting and collection, including formulation of Mission
<br>Strategic Plans (MSPs).
<br>
<br>¶B. (S/NF) This NHCD is compliant with the National
<br>Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), which was
<br>established in response to NSPD-26 of February 24, 2003. If
<br>needed, GRPO can provide further background on the NIPF and
<br>the use of NIPF abbreviations (shown in parentheses following
<br>each sub-issue below) in NHCDs.
<br>
<br>¶C. (S/NF) Important information often is available to
<br>non-State members of the Country Team whose agencies
<br>participated in the review of this National HUMINT Collection
<br>Directive. COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can
<br>assist by coordinating with other Country Team members to
<br>encourage relevant reporting through their own or State
<br>Department channels.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting:
<br>
<br>¶A. (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State
<br>reporting officers for much of the biographical information
<br>collected worldwide. Informal biographic reporting via email
<br>and other means is vital to the community's collection
<br>efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for
<br>dissemination to the IC.
<br>
<br>¶B. (S/NF) Reporting officers should include as much of the
<br>following information as possible when they have information
<br>relating to persons linked to : office and
<br>
<br>STATE 00080163 002 OF 024
<br>
<br>
<br>organizational titles; names, position titles and other
<br>information on business cards; numbers of telephones, cell
<br>phones, pagers and faxes; compendia of contact information,
<br>such as telephone directories (in compact disc or electronic
<br>format if available) and e-mail listings; internet and
<br>intranet "handles", internet e-mail addresses, web site
<br>identification-URLs; credit card account numbers; frequent
<br>flyer account numbers; work schedules, and other relevant
<br>biographical information.
