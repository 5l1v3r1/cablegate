<br> 
<br>¶1. (S/NF) This cable reports the results of a recent 
<br>Washington review of reporting and collection needs for 
<br>Paraguay.  The review produced a list of priorities 
<br>(paragraph 5) intended to guide participating USG agencies as 
<br>they allocate resources and update plans to collect 
<br>information on Paraguay.  The priorities also serve as a 
<br>useful tool to help the Embassy manage reporting and 
<br>collection, including formulation of Mission Strategic Plans 
<br>(MSPs). 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Important information often is available to 
<br>non-State members of the Country Team whose agencies 
<br>participated in the review of this National HUMINT Collection 
<br>Directive.  COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can 
<br>assist by coordinating with other Country Team members to 
<br>encourage relevant reporting through their own or State 
<br>Department channels. 
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Please note that the community relies on State 
<br>reporting officers for much of the biographical information 
<br>collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting by email 
<br>and other means is vital to this effort.  When it is 
<br>available, reporting officers should include as much of the 
<br>following information as possible: office and organizational 
<br>titles; names, position titles and other information on 
<br>business cards; numbers of telephones, cell phones, pagers 
<br>and faxes; compendia of contact information, such as 
<br>telephone directories (in compact disc or electronic format 
<br>if available) and e-mail listings; internet and intranet 
<br>"handles", internet e-mail addresses, web site 
<br>identification-URLs; credit card account numbers; frequent 
<br>flyer account numbers; work schedules, and other relevant 
<br>biographical information. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S/NF) This National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) is 
<br>compliant with the National Intelligence Priorities Framework 
<br>(NIPF), which was established in response to NSPD-26 of 
<br>February 24, 2003.  If needed, GRPO can provide further 
<br>background on the NIPF and the use of NIPF abbreviations 
<br>(shown in parentheses following each sub-issue below) in
