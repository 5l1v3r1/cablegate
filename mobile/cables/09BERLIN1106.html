<br>Classified By: MINISTER COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS GEORGE GLASS FO
<br>R REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D)
<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Less than two weeks after her party suffered losses
<br>in two state elections, CDU Chancellor Angela Merkel found
<br>her fighting spirit before 8,000 party faithful at a
<br>September 6 election rally in Duesseldorf launching the "hot
<br>phase" of the CDU/CSU electoral campaign. The CDU has been
<br>shifting party tactics after its losses in the August 30
<br>elections in Saarland and Thuringia, where the Social
<br>Democratic Party (SPD) may now be in a position to form
<br>coalitions with the Left Party. Merkel -- to great applause
<br>-- focused in on the specter of a so-called red-red
<br>government composed of the SPD and The Left Party. She
<br>described the SPD as suffering from an "identity crisis," and
<br>needing a vacation from political decision-making and time in
<br>opposition. Along with the entire CDU leadership and
<br>incumbent CDU/CSU Ministers-president, Merkel made her case
<br>for a CDU/CSU coalition with the pro-business but socially
<br>liberal FDP. She repeated the CDU/CSU's election mantra: "we
<br>have the strength" throughout her speech, aiming to convince
<br>the German electorate that a strong CDU/CSU is required for
<br>Germany to emerge from its worst economic recession in
<br>post-war history. CDU views on whether the issue of
<br>Germany's role in Afghanistan would become a more prominent
<br>campaign theme were mixed.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) With three weeks to go before the parliamentary
<br>elections, all signs point to Chancellor Merkel returning to
<br>office, although she and her party recognize that they face a
<br>difficult campaign. It remains uncertain whether the CDU and
<br>the FDP will gain enough support to form a majority
<br>coalition. If not, another Grand Coalition (CDU/CSU-SPD) is
<br>very likely; other options require a three-party
<br>constellation that would force the ill-suited Greens and FDP
<br>to work together. But, there seems to be an almost one
<br>hundred percent certainty -- given the SPD's chronic slump in
<br>the polls and limited coalition options -- that SPD Foreign
<br>Minister and Chancellor-candidate Frank Walter Steinmeier
<br>will not become Chancellor. End summary.
<br>
<br>MERKEL CASTS ASIDE SPD, EMBRACES FDP 
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Chancellor Merkel -- to rapturous cries of "Angie,
<br>Angie" and a standing ovation -- took to the floor at her
<br>party's September 6 rally before some 8,000 supporters
<br>affirming that the CDU/CSU "have the best chance to win the
<br>parliamentary elections" but also cautioning that "the
<br>election's outcome has not yet been decided." On the one
<br>hand, she praised her Grand Coalition government's record,
<br>noting its success in countering Germany's economic and
<br>financial crisis. On the other hand, she called for a new
<br>CDU/CSU coalition with the FDP after the upcoming elections--
<br>casting aside the SPD. She asserted that such a coalition
<br>would anchor Germany in the "middle" of the political
<br>spectrum and take the country out of its current economic
<br>crisis faster. Merkel said: "Our country needs a government
<br>that will support growth, security and work for everyone."
<br>In a swipe at the SPD (COMMENT: Merkel never mentioned
<br>Steinmeier by name. END COMMENT.), she said the party is
<br>currently plagued by an "identity crisis," adding that, "The
<br>SPD is devoid of any reality and is distraught." She asked,
<br>"How can a party that achieved 10, 18, and 24 percent at the
<br>recent state elections in Saxony, Thuringia, and Saarland be
<br>taken seriously?" Dismissing SPD warnings against a
<br>so-called "black-yellow" (CDU/CSU-FDP) coalition, Merkel said
<br>that the country should be more worried about the SPD's plans
<br>to form coalitions with The Left Party on the state and
<br>federal levels. (Note: The SPD has warned that a
<br>black-yellow coalition would represent wealthy Germany and
<br>business interest at the expense of the middle and lower
<br>classes.)
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) CDU leaders also tried to cast the CDU at the state
<br>level in a positive light after its poor showing in the
<br>Saarland and Thuringia state elections on August, causing the
<br>Minister President of the latter state to resign. Lower
<br>Saxony's CDU Minister President Christian Wulff asserted that
<br>the most prosperous and successful "Laender" (states) in
<br>Germany are those ruled by the CDU/CSU and FDP. He cited
<br>Berlin, governed by SPD Mayor Klaus Wowereit's Berlin (NOTE:
<br>in Berlin the SPD rules with The Left Party. END NOTE), as
<br>being the worst case. Hesse's Minister President Roland Koch
<br>-- to great applause -- noted that he could not understand
<br>how the SPD could possibly cooperate on a state or national
<br>level with a Left Party that is "anti-American and
<br>anti-European." (Note: In Saarland and Thuringia the option
<br>
<br>BERLIN 00001106 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>exists for the SPD to form a governing coalition with the
<br>Left Party. END NOTE.)
<br>
<br>CSU Truce with FDP?
<br>-------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) CSU Bavarian Minister-President Horst Seehofer threw
<br>his party's support behind a CDU/CSU coalition with the FDP,
<br>despite his well-publicized doubts about the FDP's real
<br>coalition intentions after the parliamentary elections. Even
<br>as Seehofer pronounced his support for the FDP in
<br>Duesseldorf, however, media reports from Munich confirmed
<br>that the CSU had decided to continue attacking the FDP. The
<br>CSU has been buffing its economic bona fides by attacking the
<br>FDP on its own themes while basking in the reflected glory
<br>from popular Economics Minister zu Guttenberg, the new CSU
<br>champion. Seehofer has publicly suspected that FDP Chairman
<br>Guido Westerwelle -- in an attempt to enter government at all
<br>costs -- might support a "traffic light" coalition with the
<br>SPD and the Greens, although this political constellation
<br>appears unlikely at present. In addition, Bavarian politics
<br>trump national politics, especially during a time when the
<br>CSU longs for the days when their party alone wielded
<br>political power in Munich, rather than as it does today, in a
<br>coalition with the FDP. Seehofer is also aware that the CSU
<br>needs to be strong and the FDP proportionally more weak for
<br>the CSU to win more and better ministerial posts in a
<br>CDU/CSU-FDP coalition. He did not use his appearance in
<br>Duesseldorf to chide the FDP, to the great delight of those
<br>pleading that recent CDU/CSU-FDP bickering had been harmful
<br>and counter-productive during the campaign.
<br>
<br>
<br>AFGHANISTAN - A DOMESTIC CAMPAIGN ISSUE? 
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The September 4 air strike against two fuel tankers
<br>near Kunduz, Afghanistan hit the press right before the
<br>CDU/CSU rally. In light of the German media's frenzy, PolOff
<br>asked the CDU's Head of International Relations Klemens
<br>Moemkes whether Germany's ISAF commitment might emerge as a
<br>potential domestic campaign issue. Moemkes noted that the
<br>SPD could make Afghanistan an issue but this would be very
<br>odd given Foreign Minister Steinmeier's support for Germany's
<br>military role in ISAF. However, the prospect of Afghanistan
<br>becoming a major theme clearly had the CDU's xxxxx
<br>spooked. He told PolOff that it would be very difficult for
<br>the Chancellor not to address Germany's role in Afghanistan
<br>in the coming weeks. Given the German public's overwhelming
<br>support for a withdrawal of German troops from Afghanistan,
<br>this was not an issue the Chancellor wanted to address in the
<br>run-up to the parliamentary elections.
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) While it is all but certain that Chancellor Merkel
<br>will return to office as Chancellor after the next
<br>parliamentary elections on September 27, it is too close to
<br>call whether she will achieve a coalition with the FDP.
<br>Bavarian MP Seehofer's attacks on the FDP in Bavaria could
<br>weaken that party there and further undermine the chances of
<br>a coalition. The FDP wants the same but political bickering
<br>over future ministerial positions and CSU attacks on the FDP
<br>in Bavaria and on FDP Chairman Guido Westerwelle suggest that
<br>a possible CDU/CSU-FDP coalition will not be a marriage made
<br>in heaven. Some FDP contacts admit that they harbor doubts
<br>about the Chancellor's promise to form a coalition with the
<br>FDP. They insinuate that in reality she may prefer another
<br>Grand Coalition with the SPD, although Chancellor Merkel has
<br>used every public opportunity to advertise for a CDU/CSU-FDP
<br>coalition. Backing down on this pledge would call into
<br>question her reputation.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Paradoxically, however, it is the CDU/CSU's relative
<br>weakness in the polls (35-36 percent) that threatens a
<br>possible CDU/CSU-FDP coalition. The FDP is clearly riding on
<br>a high with double-digit successes in the state elections of
<br>Saarland, Saxony, and Thuringia, but this may not be enough.
<br>The CDU refuses to engage in any self-introspection after its
<br>defeats in Saarland and Thuringia and the party can really
<br>only take comfort from the SPD's perennial weakness. The
<br>fear in the CDU is acute that the Chancellor's high
<br>popularity ratings may not be enough to ensure a comfortable
<br>win for the CDU/CSU at the parliamentary elections.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Merkel, once again, vehemently denies any intention
<br>to form a Grand Coalition with the SPD but the electoral math
<br>on September 27 may force her -- despite intense CDU/CSU
<br>reservations, not to mention those of the German public -- to
<br>look at the SPD as a partner. As for the SPD, Steinmeier is
<br>
<br>BERLIN 00001106 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>looking desperate. The SPD has failed to reach over 25
<br>percent in the last six elections and Steinmeier's unlikely
<br>path to the chancellorship is only possible if he reneges on
<br>a campaign promise not to form a coalition with The Left
<br>Party. This will not happen in 2009 but the CDU/CSU will not
<br>tire of raising the fear of a red-red coalition in 2009 or in
<br>¶2013. The Chancellor appears to be in a win-win situation
<br>but three weeks on the campaign trail can be an eternity.
<br>End comment.
