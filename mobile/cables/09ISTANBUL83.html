<br> 
<br>REF: IRPO DUBAI 95 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Deputy Principal Officer Sandra Oudkirk; Reason 1.5 (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S) Summary: A trusted contact claims he was told by a 
<br>close advisor to Iranian President Ahmadinejad that Iran 
<br>denied visas for the planned February 4, 2009 visit of the US 
<br>women's badminton because of the USG's "bad faith" in 
<br>announcing the visit earlier than Iran had requested. 
<br>According to the contact, Supreme Leader Khamenei only agreed 
<br>to the visit after Ahmadinejad urged him to do so, and only 
<br>on the understanding that no public announcements would be 
<br>made until after the team's arrival in Iran.  Instead, the 
<br>USG announced the visit on February 2, as the team was 
<br>awaiting Iranian visas in Dubai.  The regime wanted to 
<br>maintain full control of media coverage of the event, to 
<br>avoid a replay of the 1998 US wrestling team visit, when 
<br>Iranian crowds were filmed waving American flags and cheering 
<br>the US team.  The regime believed the USG issued the early 
<br>announcement to create a similar dynamic, and now Khamenei 
<br>and Ahmadinejad feel "burned."  Comment: If accurate, this 
<br>scenario underscores the challenges to building trust with a 
<br>regime that feels an obsessive fear of losing control over 
<br>both the process and substance of possible engagement with 
<br>the USG.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) "A first test":  A trusted contact of ConGen 
<br>Istanbul's Iran Watcher who recently returned from a visit to 
<br>Tehran recounted a detailed explanation he said he received 
<br>from a close advisor to President Ahmadinejad over why Iran 
<br>refused to issue visas in early February to the US women's 
<br>badminton team.  In comments that track with IRPO Dubai's 
<br>reftel reporting, our contact says he was told that Supreme 
<br>Leader Khamenei was initially opposed to allowing the visit, 
<br>but President Ahmadinejad urged him to accept it.  Even 
<br>though planning for this cultural exchange began before the 
<br>Obama administration took office, the regime including 
<br>Ahmadinejad believed this represented an important early 
<br>gesture by the new administration to build confidence and 
<br>show respect, and therefore a "first test" whether Iran could 
<br>work effectively with the Obama administration. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) Maximum GOI control: According to the presidential 
<br>advisor, the Iranian side insisted on a "carefully 
<br>calibrated" sequence of timing as a key requirement for 
<br>allowing the visit to proceed.  Iran believes it had a clear 
<br>understanding with the USG (working through the US and 
<br>Iranian badminton federations, which in Iran's case took 
<br>instructions directly from the President's office) that 
<br>announcement of the badminton team's travel to Iran and 
<br>participation in the Fajr Tournament would be embargoed until 
<br>the tournament's opening ceremony on February 5.  Iran 
<br>demanded this condition because Iran's leaders still remember 
<br>with discomfort the 1998 US wrestling team's visit to Iran, 
<br>when -- because of what Iran now sees as a failure on its 
<br>part to insist on airtight control over media coverage of the 
<br>event -- Iranian and international press broadcast scenes of 
<br>Iranian crowds cheering wildly as the US team entered the 
<br>arena carrying an American flag and continued to cheer the US 
<br>team during its matches, sometimes even waving American flags 
<br>in support.  Khamenei demanded that there be no possible 
<br>repeat of such a scene within Iran.  Given that the badminton 
<br>tournament was a women's sporting event and women's sports 
<br>are not televised in Iran, the regime felt confident it could 
<br>maintain full control over the event itself, allowing press 
<br>coverage only of the opening and closing ceremonies.  To 
<br>maximize its control, the regime insisted on an embargo over 
<br>any announcement or media coverage of the US team's 
<br>participation until the team's arrival, i.e., after the team 
<br>had been issued visas in Dubai and flown to Tehran.  This 
<br>important detail was explicitly agreed between the sports 
<br>federations, representing (in Iran's view) an understanding 
<br>between the highest levels of the USG and GOI, the 
<br>Ahmadinejad advisor insisted to our contact. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) "We were burned":  Thus, when surprised regime 
<br>leaders saw the February 2 State Department announcement of 
<br>the badminton team's participation in the Fajr Tournament, 
<br>according to our contact, they immediately assumed "bad 
<br>faith" on the part of the USG, concluding that this was an 
<br>deliberate effort by the administration to gain advantage 
<br>over the GOI and undercut the regime's control of media 
<br>coverage of the event.  The regime's immediate response, 
<br>ordered by Khamenei, was to refuse to issue the visas.  As 
<br>the Ahmadinejad advisor explained to our contact:  "Battles 
<br>of this nature, when foreign visitors come to Iran to 
<br>participate in sensitive or symbolic events, must be on our 
<br>terms and under our full control.  We had an understanding 
<br> 
<br>ISTANBUL 00000083  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>with the U.S. over how this would proceed, and we were 
<br>burned."  He added that Ahmadinejad, having personally 
<br>persuaded a reluctant Khamenei to allow the visit, felt 
<br>particularly aggrieved, and speculated to his close advisors 
<br>afterwards that this was evidence of "anti-Iranian influence" 
<br>among recently appointed foreign policy officials in the USG. 
<br> In typical Iranian fashion, GOI spokesmen blamed the 
<br>cancellation on other factors, including (from the MFA) the 
<br>"time consuming process" of visa issuance and (from Keyhan 
<br>and other conservative mouthpieces) the USG's failure to 
<br>condemn Israel over Gaza.  But according to our contact, 
<br>Tehran assumes Washington "fully understands the real reason" 
<br>for the cancellation. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) Comment:  Although it may seem far-fetched that such 
<br>a non-political exchange visit would be cancelled over a 
<br>seemingly mundane detail like the timing of the press 
<br>announcement of the visit, in Iran's case this scenario is 
<br>entirely plausible.  If accurate, this scenario highlights 
<br>the challenges to building confidence with a regime that 
<br>feels an obsessive fear of losing control over either the 
<br>substance or process of possible engagement with the USG. 
<br>Indeed, this underscores that to Iran the process of 
<br>negotiations may often be as critical to demonstrating 
<br>"goodwill" and to ensuring eventual success as the substance 
<br>of the negotiations.  This scenario also illustrates the 
<br>regime's rigid expectation that, with regard to early 
<br>confidence-building measures from the USG (especially 
<br>involving CBMs likely to generate press coverage), the GOI 
<br>must feel fully in control over how such measures play out, 
<br>and that at the first sign of any deviation from what it 
<br>believes is an agreed process, its first instinct -- 
<br>reflective of its acute fixation on self-preservation -- will 
<br>be to shut the process down and blame the other side.  End 
<br>comment.
