<br>¶1. (C) This is an action request. Please see para 10. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary: Although supportive of continued U.S. 
<br>military transits at Shannon Airport, the Irish Government 
<br>has informally begun to place constraints on U.S. operations 
<br>at the facility, mainly in response to public sensitivities 
<br>over U.S. actions in the Middle East. Shannon remains a key 
<br>transit point for U.S. troops and materiel bound for theaters 
<br>in the global war on terror, while yielding diplomatic 
<br>benefits for the Irish Government and significant revenues 
<br>for the airport and regional economy. Segments of the Irish 
<br>public, however, see the airport as a symbol of Irish 
<br>complicity in perceived U.S. wrongdoing in the Gulf/Middle 
<br>East and in regard to extraordinary renditions, a view that 
<br>underpinned a recent jury decision to acquit the "Shannon 
<br>Five" protesters who damaged a U.S. naval aircraft. The 
<br>Irish Government has repeatedly defended U.S. interests in 
<br>the face of public criticism, but has recently introduced 
<br>more cumbersome notification requirements for 
<br>equipment-related transits in the wake of the Lebanon 
<br>conflict. These requirements, which entail a more expansive 
<br>interpretation of munitions of war, are designed to give the 
<br>Irish Government mor latitude to decide on allowable 
<br>transits, accoring to a senior Department of Foreign Affairs 
<br>oficial. We suspect that the Government aims with tese new 
<br>constraints to dampen public criticism ahead of the 2007 
<br>general elections, and we would apreciate Department 
<br>gudance on a USG response, including on any next steps 
<br>regarding the Shannon Five. End summary. 
<br>
<br>Shannon: Significant Benefits and Sensitivities 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) U.S. military access to Shannon Airport in western 
<br>Ireland is among the most tangible benefits of traditionally 
<br>strong U.S.-Irish relations. For the United States, 
<br>geography makes Shannon a key transit point for military 
<br>flights and military contract flights carrying personnel and 
<br>materiel to Iraq and the Middle East/Gulf theater in the 
<br>global war on terror, as well as to Europe and Africa. In 
<br>2005, roughly 340,000 U.S. troops passed through Shannon on 
<br>nearly 2,500 contract carrier flights; about 450 
<br>equipment-related/distinguished-visitor transit milair 
<br>flights and thousands of airspace overflights also took 
<br>place. Approximately 220,000 troops have transited to date 
<br>this year. For Ireland, U.S. military transits not only 
<br>demonstrate bilateral cooperation in support of U.S. 
<br>objectives in the Gulf/Middle East, but also generate 
<br>significant revenue for Shannon Airport and the regional 
<br>economy. In 2005, the airport turned a euro 2.9 million 
<br>profit after earning roughly euro 10.3 million from services 
<br>for transit flights, including landing, parking, catering, 
<br>and fuel. The economic gains for the Shannon area are less 
<br>easily calculated, but would include, at a minimum, payments 
<br>for hotels, food/beverages, transportation, and cultural 
<br>activities that come with 8-10 overnight stops per year for 
<br>roughly 200 soldiers each time. (Revenues may fall in 2006, 
<br>as World Airways, a DOD-contract carrier, has begun to 
<br>transfer operations from Shannon to its Leipzig hub for 
<br>internal logistical reasons.) 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) For segments of the Irish public, however, the 
<br>visibility of U.S. troops at Shannon has made the airport a 
<br>symbol of Irish complicity in perceived U.S. wrongdoing in 
<br>the Gulf/Middle East. This popular sentiment was manifest in 
<br>the July 25 jury decision to acquit the "Shannon Five," a 
<br>group of anti-war protesters who damaged a U.S. naval 
<br>aircraft at the airport in 2003 in the belief that they would 
<br>prevent loss of life in Iraq (ref A). Members of the Shannon 
<br>Five have subsequently called for a mass demonstration in 
<br>Dublin on September 23 (capitalizing on publicity for the 
<br>September 21-24 Ryder Cup tournament and the return of 
<br>university students) as part of a campaign to "demilitarize" 
<br>the airport. Although it is by no means clear that any 
<br>protest will reach "mass" proportions, participation in the 
<br>planned protest will likely draw from a vocal anti-war lobby 
<br>that has demonstrated against U.S. use of Shannon from the 
<br>start of the Iraq War up through the recent Lebanon conflict. 
<br>
<br>DUBLIN 00001020 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>In late 2005/early 2006, EU-wide debate on extraordinary 
<br>renditions similarly galvanized this lobby, and the Irish 
<br>public generally, to question U.S. military access to the 
<br>airport. 
<br>
<br>The Irish Government and Shannon 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Irish Government consistently has acted to ensure 
<br>continued U.S. military transits at Shannon in the face of 
<br>public criticism. Since the Shannon Five decision, for 
<br>example, Irish authorities have upgraded airport security, 
<br>doubling the number of police and military personnel 
<br>patrolling the facility and introducing rigorous checks at 
<br>the parking lot and perimeter fence. (The upgrade is also 
<br>partly a response to possible Islamic extremist threats.) 
<br>Moreover, despite a general Government reluctance to 
<br>challenge independent court decisions, Defense Minister 
<br>Willie O'Dea and governing Fianna Fail party politicians have 
<br>publicly questioned the legal merits of the Shannon Five jury 
<br>decision. These public statements track with representations 
<br>to the Irish Parliament by Government ministers over recent 
<br>years and months in defense of U.S. practices at Shannon, 
<br>including by Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern, who cited U.S. 
<br>assurances on renditions this past year to rebuff calls for 
<br>random aircraft checks. In parliamentary debate this spring, 
<br>Minister of State for Europe, Noel Treacy, dismissed renewed 
<br>calls for random inspections following the transit of a U.S. 
<br>military prisoner that occurred without prior notification to 
<br>the Irish Government (ref B). 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Notwithstanding its general support for U.S. 
<br>interests, the Irish Government has more recently begun to 
<br>place limits on certain forms of U.S. transits at Shannon. 
<br>On August 15, the Irish Department of Transport informally 
<br>advised Post by e-mail that all military equipment, including 
<br>HMMWVs and trucks, were to be considered "munitions of war," 
<br>requiring prior notification to the Transport Department and 
<br>exemption waivers for transshipment. In addition to 
<br>diplomatic clearance requests for state aircraft, we have 
<br>heretofore provided notification for troop transits (with 
<br>accompanying weapons), hazmat, and actual weapons/munitions, 
<br>but not non-lethal military articles. The Transport 
<br>Department notice followed upon the Department of Foreign 
<br>Affairs (DFA) oral but definitive decision during the Lebanon 
<br>conflict to forbid U.S. military transits carrying munitions 
<br>to Israel, a policy that DFA did not convey to Post before 
<br>informing the media. Indications of this trend to constrain 
<br>U.S. operations at Shannon first arose in the context of the 
<br>extraordinary renditions issue. In late 2005, for instance, 
<br>the DFA informally denied a DHS deportation transit through 
<br>Shannon of convicted foreign nationals from the United States 
<br>out of apparent concern that the public would misread the 
<br>transit as a rendition. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) In an August 30 meeting with the DCM and emboff, DFA 
<br>Political Director Rory Montgomery said that the Department 
<br>of Transport's more encompassing approach to munitions of war 
<br>and notification requirements reflected the Irish 
<br>Government's interest in knowing the full scope of military 
<br>materiel transiting Ireland. He recalled that the February 
<br>shipment through Shannon of U.S. Apache helicopters to/from 
<br>Israel, which the U.S. contract carrier had not listed as 
<br>munitions of war, elicited parliamentary criticism and 
<br>highlighted the need for clarity about the nature of materiel 
<br>in transit (ref C). More expansive notification requirements 
<br>that would apply to all countries would "make it easier" for 
<br>the Irish Government to decide on allowable shipments, while 
<br>remaining predisposed to respond quickly and positively to 
<br>U.S. transit requests, said Montgomery. He added that the 
<br>DFA would recommend that the Department of Transport consult 
<br>with Post in the process of clarifying and publishing 
<br>guidance on munitions of war. The DCM noted Post's intention 
<br>to confer with the Transport Department, and he emphasized 
<br>that broader notification requirements would make it more 
<br>cumbersome to process materiel shipments, with the 
<br>possibility that U.S. military planners would consider 
<br>alternatives to Shannon as a transit hub. 
<br>
<br>Comment and Action Request 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Comment: Irish sensitivities generally about foreign 
<br>military usage of the airport often make any inadvertent 
<br>
<br>DUBLIN 00001020 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>breaches of Ireland's restrictive rules on foreign military 
<br>transits more visible and problematic. A neutral country, 
<br>Ireland has no military attache system, no SOFA for U.S. 
<br>activities, and strict rules regarding weapons transits and 
<br>the wearing of foreign military uniforms. Occasional and 
<br>inadvertent breaches of weapons and uniform policies, like 
<br>"failure" to notify transiting prisoners (ref B) and military 
<br>equipment, are met with public and press scrutiny, but also 
<br>with Government understanding. Any incident, however, that 
<br>becomes the cause for a public debate about the U.S. use of 
<br>Shannon will likely add pressure on the Government. Embassy 
<br>has sought to manage the policy issues, notification 
<br>requirements, and the coordination of transiting flights, 
<br>overflights, refuelings, crew rest overnights, and equipment 
<br>failure overnights with existing DAO and civilian Embassy 
<br>resources on the ground. With the help of extra TDY support 
<br>to the DAO office and a TDY EUCOM presence at Shannon airport 
<br>(which is three-and-a-half hours from Dublin), we have 
<br>managed the occasional problems adequately and well. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) More comment: We intend to engage other ranking DFA, 
<br>Transport, and Irish Defense Department officials, upon their 
<br>return from the August holiday period, on the reasons for new 
<br>constraints at Shannon, particularly the novel interpretation 
<br>of munitions of war and its application to other countries 
<br>(Russian transits to Venezuela, for instance). The Irish 
<br>public's overwhelming opposition to Israeli military actions 
<br>in Lebanon has exacerbated the governing Fianna Fail party's 
<br>sensitivity to public criticism ahead of Ireland's May 2007 
<br>general elections. The major opposition party, Fine Gael, 
<br>supports continued U.S. military use of Shannon, but the 
<br>Labour Party and the Green Party, Fine Gael's opposition 
<br>partners, favor a review, if not reversal, of Irish policy on 
<br>U.S. transits. Against this political backdrop, U.S. 
<br>missteps at Shannon could easily become campaign grist, a 
<br>Fianna Fail concern that mid-level DFA officials have cited 
<br>in informal discussions with Post. Compliance with the new 
<br>rules (entailing notification for almost any U.S. military 
<br>equipment transiting), if feasible from the U.S. logistical 
<br>perspective, will require a higher order of coordination 
<br>among TRANSCOM, Air Mobility Command, TACC, and the contract 
<br>carriers. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Action request: We would appreciate input from the 
<br>Department and other USG agencies for our planned follow-on 
<br>discussions with Irish officials on Shannon. Embassy will 
<br>diplomatically pursue the most workable arrangements possible 
<br>with Irish officials, but we would appreciate Washington's 
<br>judgment as to whether the process of notification of almost 
<br>everything of a military nature (including by contract 
<br>carriers) through Shannon is becoming too difficult to make 
<br>the airport a preferred transit stop. Guidance is also 
<br>requested regarding the Shannon Five decision, an outcome 
<br>that DFA Political Director Montgomery described as "bizarre" 
<br>and presumably not precedential. Our understanding is that 
<br>the case, as a criminal matter, has run its course, as there 
<br>is no possibility to appeal a jury decision under Irish law. 
<br>There may be an option to pursue the case as a civil matter, 
<br>and Post would need authorization and funding to contact 
<br>local attorneys about this possibility. Another option would 
<br>be to present an itemized bill for aircraft damages to the 
<br>Irish Government, either to seek compensation outright or, at 
<br>least, to convey USG dissatisfaction with the Shannon Five 
<br>verdict.
