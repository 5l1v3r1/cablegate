<br>SUBJECT: PARAGUAY: TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS ASSESSMENT REPORT 
<br>AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) This is an action request; see para 10. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) SUMMARY: The USD 155K that post received in FY-2004 
<br>has played an important role in helping Paraguay combat its 
<br>TIP problem, particularly in the areas of prevention and 
<br>protection. However, post anticipates these funds running 
<br>out by the end of 2006. Working closely with U.S. experts 
<br>and GOP officials, we have identified concrete requirements 
<br>to strengthen Paraguay's ability to combat trafficking in the 
<br>coming year. As part of a bilateral assistance project 
<br>between the Embassy of the United States in Asuncion and the 
<br>Government of Paraguay (GOP), the USG conducted a study of 
<br>Paraguay,s system of immigration and border controls between 
<br>July 23 through August 5, 2005, with a view to offering 
<br>recommendations to the GOP that would assist it in combating 
<br>the problem of trafficking in persons (TIP) by improving 
<br>border controls. A team of Department of Homeland Security 
<br>(DHS) officials led the assessment. The DHS Team included 
<br>agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and 
<br>Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Post requests an 
<br>allocation of USD 310,000 in FY-2006 INL funds consistent 
<br>with the DHS Team's recommendations and consultation with GOP 
<br>officials to continue assisting the GOP in combating TIP. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>The Assessment 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) Paraguay is a source country for trafficked women and 
<br>children, many of whom are smuggled across Paraguay's borders 
<br>into the neighboring countries of Brazil and Argentina. 
<br>Paraguay's Department of Immigration is aware of the TIP 
<br>problem and acknowledges the GOP must improve its border 
<br>controls in order to prevent traffickers from transporting 
<br>victims across its borders. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) During the assessment, the team spoke with several 
<br>Ministry and Secretariat officials in Asuncion, including the 
<br>Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Customs, and Interior 
<br>(Immigration Department), the Secretariats of Women, 
<br>Repatriations, and Children and Adolescents. They also spoke 
<br>to the Inter-American Development Bank and non-governmental 
<br>organizations (NGOs) such as Grupo Luna Nueva, a local 
<br>recovery center for victims. The team visited several land 
<br>border inspection stations including Ciudad del Este, 
<br>Encarnacion, Pedro Juan Caballero and Puerto Falcon. They 
<br>also inspected the Silvio Pettirossi International Airport in 
<br>Asuncion. 
<br>
<br>------------------------- 
<br>More Money, Fewer Problems 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) The assessment report has been reviewed by all the 
<br>stakeholders within AMEmbassy Asuncion and was translated 
<br>into Spanish and provided to our GOP counterparts. The next 
<br>phase of this project is to take action on the 
<br>recommendations made by the Team. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) In order to build on advances made by the GOP, Post 
<br>has identified several areas that will assist the GOP better 
<br>in its efforts to combat TIP. Our focus in the coming year 
<br>is to expand training for officials, investigators, 
<br>prosecutors and judges; assist the GOP to expand 
<br>rehabilitation center services in government run shelters; 
<br>enhance border controls; and establish and maintain a victim 
<br>database to provide better services to the victims of TIP and 
<br>prosecute perpetrators. However, the GOP will require 
<br>outside funds to meet essential program requirements. 
<br>
<br>---------- 
<br>Prevention 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>7.(U) Prevention represents the weakest link in GOP efforts 
<br>to combat trafficking. The GOP has taken some positive steps 
<br>that we have supported - information pamphlets and radio 
<br>spots along with a hotline -- but funding and prevention 
<br>programs remain weak. Post recommends continued funding 
<br>support for the Ministry of Womens Affairs outreach programs 
<br>to prevent trafficking as well as the following: 
<br>
<br>-- The DHS team recommends holding an annual border control 
<br>symposium in Asuncion with the participation of all border 
<br>control agencies. A symposium will provide the opportunity 
<br>for agency administrators to clearly communicate the mission 
<br>of the individual border control agencies, establish a 
<br>national strategy as well as coordinate a unified border 
<br>enforcement effort. In addition, this symposium would 
<br>address the concerns heard by the DHS officers of many border 
<br>control front line officials regarding a concern relating to 
<br>a "disconnect" between Asuncion and frontline border crossing 
<br>offices. Post would fund the first border patrol symposium. 
<br>
<br>-- The DHS team recommends that a supervisory level U.S. 
<br>Customs and Border Protection Officer be detailed to Paraguay 
<br>for a 30-60 day period to provide advisory assistance at the 
<br>various ports of entry to assist Paraguayan officials in 
<br>implementing administrative and procedural changes. The Team 
<br>feels that Paraguayan border control officials are capable of 
<br>performing their duties but lack the proper training and 
<br>guidance. A short-term advisor could assist in teaching them 
<br>to conduct interviews, searches, observation techniques, etc. 
<br>
<br>-- The DHS team recommends that selected Paraguayan officials 
<br>with direct supervisory responsibilities at Paraguayan ports 
<br>of entry be given the opportunity to travel to the U.S. and 
<br>observe first-hand U.S. border management techniques and 
<br>functions at specific U.S. ports of entry. 
<br>
<br>---------- 
<br>Protection 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) The GOP has made some strides in providing support and 
<br>protection to victims but resources are few. The Ministry of 
<br>Repatriations seeks corporate funds to repatriate victims 
<br>because the GOP cannot support adequately the ministries 
<br>operations. In addition, the Ministry of Women's Affairs has 
<br>ambitious plans to establish a shelter to provide victims a 
<br>place to reside while in Asuncion once they are repatriated. 
<br>Again, the lack of GOP resources has prevented the ministry 
<br>from establishing a 50 bed facility. At this time, a 
<br>Catholic monastry is providing beds to the Ministry of 
<br>Women's Affairs. Usually the victims remain in Asuncion for 
<br>approximately 2 or 3 months while they are receiving legal, 
<br>medical, psychological and rehabilitative services. Once the 
<br>women leave Asuncion, there is no follow-up or support 
<br>program to assist victims in returning to their home town. 
<br>Last year, post provided funds to assist the Women's Ministry 
<br>in creating a rehabilitation center that provides trafficked 
<br>women with services including psychological and job 
<br>counseling. Post recommends identifying funds to support the 
<br>establishment of a more permanent shelter to protect victims 
<br>and assist them in making the transition to stability as well 
<br>as efforts to expand GOP support for victims in the interior 
<br>of the country.<br>
