<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR THE SECRETARY'S JANUARY 13-15 
<br>VISIT TO ISRAEL 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Richard H. Jones, Reason 1.4 (b) (d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S) Madam Secretary, internal tensions among GOI leaders 
<br>have intensified since your last visit and have reached the 
<br>point that there appears to be little coordination or even 
<br>dialogue among the key decision makers.  Therefore, we will 
<br>need to be sensitive to perceptions that we are favoring one 
<br>faction over another.  The divisions at the top here are part 
<br>of an increasingly gloomy public mood, with a new corruption 
<br>allegations making headlines virtually daily, and a growing 
<br>sense of political failure despite Israel's strong economy 
<br>and a sustained success rate in thwarting suicide attacks. 
<br>Prime Minister Olmert's approval ratings were only 23 percent 
<br>in the latest poll, and Israeli interlocutors across the 
<br>political spectrum are speaking openly of a crisis of public 
<br>confidence in the country's leadership at a time when 
<br>Israelis feel an urgent need for strong leadership to face 
<br>the threats from Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hizballah. 
<br> 
<br>OPTIMISM ERODING 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S) The year 2007 has started off badly for Israelis. 
<br>The good feeling generated by PM Olmert's long-delayed 
<br>December 23 summit meeting with Abu Mazen quickly dissipated 
<br>under the weight of reports of a new settlement in the Jordan 
<br>Valley (now suspended by Peretz), continued Qassam rocket 
<br>attacks on Sderot and neighboring kibbutzim, foot-dragging on 
<br>both sides in implementing the transfer of tax revenues, lack 
<br>of progress on the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, and the 
<br>unpleasant atmospherics of the January 4 Olmert-Mubarak 
<br>summit, which was overshadowed by a botched IDF daylight raid 
<br>in the center of Ramallah in which four Palestinians were 
<br>killed. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S) The Ramallah operation, which was authorized by the 
<br>IDF's West Bank commander without informing the Minister of 
<br>Defense, served as a stark reminder of the lack of 
<br>coordination between Israel's military and its civilian 
<br>leadership.  When it comes to Israel's strategy for dealing 
<br>with Palestinians, it increasingly seems that military is 
<br>military, civilian is civilian and never the twain shall 
<br>meet!  Despite Olmert's belated embrace of Abu Mazen as a 
<br>peace partner, there is growing concern that moderate Arab 
<br>willingness to maintain the embargo on Hamas may be eroding, 
<br>and that Fatah may fail to muster the popular support it will 
<br>need to depose Hamas, whether at the ballot box or in the 
<br>streets.  Meanwhile, the upcoming release of the results of 
<br>the Winograd Commission's investigation of the Lebanon war 
<br>hangs like a sword of Damocles over the heads of Olmert, 
<br>Defense Minister Peretz, and IDF Chief of General Staff 
<br>Halutz.  Peretz and Halutz have both publicly stated that 
<br>they will resign if the Commission holds them responsible for 
<br>serious errors in the conduct of the war, but Olmert has 
<br>refrained from public comments.  Olmert is also awaiting the 
<br>results of several separate investigations involving 
<br>corruption allegations, any one of which could further damage 
<br>him severely, if not force his resignation. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (S) While Israeli anxiety over a possible dramatic shift 
<br>of U.S. policy as a result of the Iraq Study Group's report 
<br>has been allayed by statements by you and the President, 
<br>there continues to be deep uneasiness here that the 
<br>Baker-Hamilton recommendations reflect the shape of things to 
<br>come in U.S. policy.  Israelis recognize that U.S. public 
<br>support for the Iraq war is eroding and are following with 
<br>interest the President's upcoming articulation of the 
<br>revamped policy, but they are deeply concerned that 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian issues not become linked in American 
<br>minds to creating a more propitious regional environment for 
<br>whatever steps we decide to take to address the deteriorating 
<br>situation in Iraq. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S) Iran's nuclear program continues to cause great 
<br>anxiety in Israel.  Given their history, Israelis across the 
<br>political spectrum take very seriously Ahmadinejad's threats 
<br>to wipe Israel off the map.  Olmert has been quite clear in 
<br>his public comments that Israel cannot tolerate a 
<br>nuclear-armed Iran, a position stated even more emphatically 
<br>by opposition leader Netanyahu, who compares today's Iran to 
<br>Nazi Germany in 1938.  Despite the worst-case assessments of 
<br>Israeli intelligence, however, there is a range of views 
<br>about what action Israel should take.  The MFA and some of 
<br>the think tank Iran experts appear increasingly inclined to 
<br>state that military action must be a last resort and are 
<br>taking a new interests in other forms of pressure, including 
<br>but not limited to sanctions, that could force Iran to 
<br>abandon its military nuclear program.  The IDF, however, 
<br>srikes us as more inclined than ever to look toward a 
<br>military strike, whether launched by Israel or by us, as the 
<br>only way to destroy or even delay Iran's plans.  Thoughtful 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00000064  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Israeli analysts point out that even if a nuclear-armed Iran 
<br>did not immediately launch a strike on the Israeli heartland, 
<br>the very fact that Iran possesses nuclear weapons would 
<br>completely transform the Middle East strategic environment in 
<br>ways that would make Israel's long-term survival as a 
<br>democratic Jewish state increasingly problematic.  That 
<br>concern is most intensively reflected in open talk by those 
<br>who say they do not want their children and grandchildren 
<br>growing up in an Israel threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran. 
<br> 
<br>LIVNI RISING 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) FM Tzipi Livni is frustrated by Olmert's continued 
<br>refusal to coordinate closely, and -- perhaps with an eye on 
<br>polls showing her popularity at over double the level of the 
<br>Prime Minister -- suggested to a Ha'aretz interviewer in late 
<br>December that she would challenge Olmert for the prime 
<br>ministership if he continued not to give her his full 
<br>backing.  In the same interview, Livni provided an outline of 
<br>her thinking, but not a detailed plan, on the way ahead with 
<br>the Arabs, including negotiating an interim agreement with 
<br>the Palestinians in which the separation barrier would serve 
<br>as the border, and refusing to engage with Syria unless Asad 
<br>takes steps to end support for terrorism and distances 
<br>himself from Iran.  Livni's policy adviser has confirmed to 
<br>us that she has engaged in her own discrete discussions with 
<br>Palestinians, but very much in an exploratory mode.  Livni 
<br>told Senators Kerry and Dodd that she doubted that a final 
<br>status agreement could be reached with Abu Mazen, and 
<br>therefore the emphasis should be on reforming Fatah so that 
<br>it could beat Hamas at the polls.  MFA officials tell us that 
<br>Livni is also focused on the need to keep Hamas isolated. 
<br>She and her senior staff have repeatedly expressed concern 
<br>that some EU member-states are wobbly on this point. 
<br>Meanwhile, Livni is keenly aware that unlike Olmert, she has 
<br>little to fear from the Winograd Commission report (nor is 
<br>she tainted by the corruption allegations that dog Olmert). 
<br>Her incipient bid to take Olmert's place could become more 
<br>serious once the report's preliminary conclusions are 
<br>released next month. 
<br> 
<br>SHIFTING VIEWS ON SYRIA 
<br>----------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (S) Olmert and Livni agree that negotiations with Syria 
<br>would be a trap that Damascus would use to end the 
<br>international pressure on it and to gain a freer hand in 
<br>Lebanon.  While they see public relations downsides to 
<br>dismissing Syrian peace overtures out of hand, they continue 
<br>to insist that no negotiations will be possible until Syria 
<br>reduces its support for terrorism and/or takes direct steps 
<br>to secure the release of Israeli prisoners held by Hamas and 
<br>Hizballah.  Olmert and Livni are supported in that view by 
<br>Mossad chief Dagan, who takes a dim view of Syrian 
<br>intentions.  A significant part of the security 
<br>establishment, however, appears to be reaching the conclusion 
<br>that it is in Israel's interest to test Asad's intentions -- 
<br>possibly through the use of a back channel contact -- and to 
<br>seek to wean him away from Tehran.  They are joined in that 
<br>view by Defense Minister Peretz, much of the Labor Party and 
<br>the Israeli left, who argue that Israel cannot afford to 
<br>refuse to at least explore Asad's offer to negotiate, often 
<br>comparing that stance to Golda Meir's much-criticized 
<br>decision to spurn Sadat's offer to negotiate, which then led 
<br>to the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  Press reports January 5 stated 
<br>that the defense establishment had recommended to Olmert that 
<br>he open an exploratory channel to Damascus in two months, a 
<br>timeline reportedly linked to the completion of reviews of 
<br>U.S. policy toward Iraq and the Middle East, as well as to 
<br>clearer indications of Abu Mazen's intentions and 
<br>capabilities vis a vis Hamas. 
<br> 
<br>PERETZ-OLMERT TENSIONS 
<br>---------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) According to leaks from a recent Labor Party 
<br>leadership meeting, Amir Peretz said that he feels completely 
<br>disconnected from Olmert.  Ever since Peretz' telephone 
<br>conversation with Abu Mazen which infuriated Olmert, the two 
<br>reportedly barely speak to each other.  Television news 
<br>reports on January 4 trumpeted rumors that Olmert had decided 
<br>to remove Peretz as Defense Minister and replace him with 
<br>former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who has already announced 
<br>plans to challenge Peretz for the Labor Party's leadership in 
<br>late May primaries.  Even though the Prime Minister's Office 
<br>almost immediately denied the reports, there is little doubt 
<br>here that someone in the PMO was behind them.  While much of 
<br>the Labor Party feels that Peretz has been a failure, both as 
<br>Defense Minister and as Party Secretary General, and Peretz' 
<br>popularity with the general public has hit rock bottom, Labor 
<br> 
<br>TEL AVIV 00000064  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>members widely condemned the media trial balloon, which they 
<br>saw as an unacceptable attempt by Olmert's advisers to 
<br>intervene in their party's leadership contest.  In any event, 
<br>the incident is yet another indication of the intense degree 
<br>of personal rancor and dysfunction prevailing at the top of 
<br>the GOI. 
<br> 
<br>PERETZ AND SNEH OUR AMA PARTNERS 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C) Notwithstanding the GOI's internal discord, there is 
<br>some good news in our efforts to nudge the GOI toward 
<br>improvements in Palestinian quality of life issues.  Despite 
<br>his political woes, Peretz has proven himself a serious 
<br>partner in our efforts to implement the Agreement on Movement 
<br>and Access (AMA) and more generally in a slow but steady push 
<br>by the MOD to force a reluctant IDF to accept steps to reduce 
<br>barriers to Palestinian movement and to revive the 
<br>Palestinian economy.  Deputy Defense Minister Efraim Sneh, 
<br>who will likely accompany Peretz to your meeting, has emerged 
<br>as the point man for these efforts.  Sneh shares Peretz' 
<br>conviction that Israel's security stranglehold on the 
<br>Palestinians is "winning the battle but losing the war," but 
<br>Sneh, who in a decades-long career served as a military 
<br>governor of the West Bank, commanded an elite combat unit, 
<br>and took part in the famed Entebbe raid, also has both an 
<br>intimate knowledge of the Palestinians and a combat 
<br>commander's credibility with the IDF that Peretz sorely 
<br>lacks.  Your meeting with Peretz provides an opportunity to 
<br>express appreciation for his and Sneh's efforts and to 
<br>encourage them in their struggle to bring recalcitrant 
<br>elements in the IDF to heel.  The more progress we can 
<br>achieve with them on AMA implementation now, the easier it 
<br>will be to achieve meaningful results with both parties in 
<br>the coming year.
