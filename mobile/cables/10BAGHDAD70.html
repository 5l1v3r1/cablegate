<br>
<br>REF: A. A) BAGHDAD 3334 
<br>¶B. B) BAGHDAD 0028 
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM ROBERT S. FORD FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Senators John McCain (R/AZ), Joseph Lieberman 
<br>(I/CT), John Barrasso (R/WY), and John Thune (R/SD) on 
<br>January 5, 2009 held meetings with Iraqi President Jalal 
<br>Talabani and Vice President Adil Abd al-Mahdi to discuss the 
<br>recent Blackwater ruling, upcoming Iraqi national election, 
<br>and Iraq's regional relations. In separate meetings, both 
<br>Talabani and Abd al-Mahdi discussed the status of Iraqi 
<br>relations with Iran relative to the Fakkah oil field 
<br>incident. Additionally, Talabani commented on the 
<br>seriousness of recent demonstrations inside Iran and 
<br>cautioned the U.S. against showing public support for the 
<br>Iranian opposition, which could undermine their credibility. 
<br>For his part, Abd al-Mahdi discussed the need for Iraqi 
<br>elections to be seen as transparent and legitimate, and noted 
<br>the importance of a timely government formation period. With 
<br>regard to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, Abd 
<br>al-Mahdi acknowledged progress made in strengthening the 
<br>Iraqi Army, but stressed the importance of not overestimating 
<br>Iraq's capabilities. He called for the U.S. and Iraqi 
<br>governments to reassess the current security situation and 
<br>revise the security agreement accordingly after the new Iraqi 
<br>government is established. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>REPERCUSSIONS OF BLACKWATER RULING 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) President Talabani remarked that he hoped the incident 
<br>would not affect the relationship between Iraq and the U.S. 
<br>and commented that even in Iraq, courts are independent and 
<br>sometimes issue decisions that those in the government do not 
<br>agree with, but such rulings must be obeyed regardless. The 
<br>Vice President stressed the importance of an appeal as the 
<br>Iraqi people are looking for justice. Abd al-Mahdi noted 
<br>that in a separate incident one of his personal guards was 
<br>killed by an intoxicated Blackwater employee. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>THE IRAN-IRAQ BORDER DISPUTE 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Abd al-Mahdi commented that Iraqi relations with Iran 
<br>are at a low point, noting that what the Iranians did in 
<br>Fakkah was a mistake. (Ref A) He said that both countries 
<br>acknowledge that the Fakkah oil well is in a disputed area, 
<br>because of the unclear border between Iran and Iraq, but he 
<br>believed the situation was returning to normal as evidenced 
<br>by the Iranians removing their flag from the field. The Vice 
<br>President stressed that because of Iraq's shared border with 
<br>Iran, it is very important to maintain good relations between 
<br>the two countries, just as the same is true for Iraqi 
<br>relations with Turkey and Syria. He believed that Iraq could 
<br>not risk its future by entering into a new conflict with 
<br>Iran. Abd al-Mahdi stated that Iraq cannot wage war against 
<br>its neighbors, and said that the more problems Iraq has with 
<br>its neighbors, the more they must negotiate to overcome those 
<br>problems. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Talabani commented that the 1975 Algiers Agreement (on 
<br>border delineation) is the root of many problems surrounding 
<br>the Iran-Iraq border. The President commented that in some 
<br>places the Iranians are moving toward the border because of 
<br>what they see as laid out in the 1975 Agreement, but said 
<br>Qwhat they see as laid out in the 1975 Agreement, but said 
<br>that the Iraqis do not recognize the agreement because it was 
<br>formalized under the Saddam regime. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>TALABANI: U.S. SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF IMPACT OF SUPPORTING IRAN 
<br>OPPOSITION 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) When asked about the ongoing demonstrations in Iran 
<br>and whether such events pose a real threat to the Iranian 
<br>regime, Talabani said that the current demonstrations are 
<br>very serious and represent the division among the political 
<br>leaders and religious authorities trickling down to the 
<br>street level. The President commented that Iran has a 
<br>diverse population, with differences among all groups running 
<br>
<br>
<br>deep with a long history. He stressed that it was not that 
<br>the Iranian regime was weak, but rather that the opposing 
<br>side was strong. Talabani said that the Iranian opposition 
<br>included both experienced Iranian politicians, to include 
<br>Mousavi, Rafsanjani, and Karrubi, and important religious 
<br>figures. He also commented that whereas the demonstrations 
<br>at first were attacking Iranian President Ahmadinejad, they 
<br>have now shifted to being against Supreme Leader Khamenei. 
<br>Talabani said that the Iranian government feels threatened. 
<br>In response, Iran has threatened to use any force necessary, 
<br>and was presently trying to pass a law in the Parliament to 
<br>hang those found to be against the regime. Talabani also 
<br>commented that historically major leadership changes in Iran 
<br>begin in the main cities and spread throughout the country. 
<br>He opined that what is currently transpiring is reminiscent 
<br>of past major changes in Iran. However, he believed that 
<br>unlike in previous scenarios, the current regime is able to 
<br>threaten people without any fear of a third party stepping 
<br>in. Talabani said for example that the Shah was somewhat 
<br>tempered by his fear of the U.S. intervening, but that no 
<br>such moderating force presently exists. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) With regard to any possible show of U.S. support to 
<br>the Iranian people, Talabani cautioned that the U.S. must 
<br>consider how the Iranian regime could use a show of U.S. 
<br>solidarity toward the Iranian opposition to further label the 
<br>opposition as agents of the U.S. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Referring to his conversations with Syrian President 
<br>Bashar al-Asad, Talabani said that the Syrians deny suicide 
<br>bombers enter Iraq via Syria and say they support Iraqi unity 
<br>and security. Talabani opined that certain parts of the 
<br>Syrian regime were supportive of such terrorists. Talabani 
<br>also commented that none of Iraq,s neighbors are happy about 
<br>Iraq's success and do not want a strong, united Iraq, as they 
<br>fear Iraq as a model of democracy in the region and Iraq,s 
<br>ability to assume its share of the oil market. However, 
<br>Talabani stated that regardless of the positions held by its 
<br>neighbors, Iraq will continue to advance in achieving its 
<br>goals. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>ABD AL-MAHDI HINTS FASTER GOVERNMENT FORMATION IN 2010 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Adil Abd al-Mahdi in response to an inquiry into his 
<br>assessment of the upcoming Iraqi national election said that 
<br>he believed that elections are always good, especially in a 
<br>country working to move past a history of tyranny and 
<br>dictatorship and embrace democracy. He hoped to see a 
<br>transparent and legitimate election, free from foreign 
<br>interference, and noted that the provincial elections 
<br>demonstrated that Iraq is moving in the right direction with 
<br>this regard. The Vice President believed that holding a 
<br>successful national election would help to further stabilize 
<br>the Iraqi political system. He hoped that participation in 
<br>the election would be as high as that of previous elections, 
<br>but acknowledged that turnout could be somewhat less. Abd 
<br>al-Mahdi commented that the four-month delay in forming a 
<br>government following the previous national election was 
<br>damaging to Iraq and sent the wrong message to Iraq's 
<br>enemies. He noted that Iraqi blocs currently are engaged in 
<br>Qenemies. He noted that Iraqi blocs currently are engaged in 
<br>negotiations in an effort to minimize the length of the 
<br>government formation period. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Abd al-Mahdi said he believed "popular mobilization" 
<br>was the best method to campaign for the national election, 
<br>whereby candidates get out to visit various neighborhoods and 
<br>go house to house engaging the Iraqi population. The Vice 
<br>President also commented that campaigning will utilize both 
<br>radio and television, and that during this campaign season 
<br>there would also be several debates. Abd al-Mahdi noted that 
<br>elections in 2010 will differ from the previous national 
<br>elections, in that the Iraqi people will vote for individuals 
<br>as opposed to lists, which he believed was a positive change 
<br>and would result in less polarization. Additionally, he 
<br>observed that there were good and respected names on the 
<br>candidate lists. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) When asked, Abd al-Mahdi acknowledged that he is a 
<br>contender for the prime ministership, but noted that as is 
<br>the case in all elections, the election outcome and alliances 
<br>formed would ultimately determine the next prime minister. 
<br>
<br>
<br>(Comment: It was evident that Abd al-Mahdi clearly remembers 
<br>the role that the U.S. Ambassador played in preventing him 
<br>from becoming Prime Minister in 2006 because of his ties to 
<br>Iran. End Comment.) 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>TALABANI: SHIA LISTS WILL DOMINATE 
<br>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) President Talabani when queried as to his election 
<br>predictions said that he believed the winning bloc would 
<br>either be Maliki's State of Law or the Iraqi National 
<br>Alliance (INA), with Allawi's list coming third. Regarding 
<br>the Kurdish bloc, Talabani said that the PUK and KDP lists 
<br>will be united, but that all Kurdish parties will be working 
<br>to advance themselves. However, he stated that regardless of 
<br>election outcome, the Kurds will remain a united force in 
<br>Baghdad. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
<br>ABD AL-MAHDI CAUTIONS AGAINST OVERESTIMATING IRAQI FORCES 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) In response to an inquiry into concerns surrounding 
<br>the U.S. withdrawal and the readiness of the Iraqi Army (IA) 
<br>to fill that void, Abd al-Mahdi said that there are less 
<br>fears of this prospect than there were two years ago. The 
<br>Vice President acknowledged that there are good signs of 
<br>development in the IA, but said he thought all parties 
<br>overestimated progress made and said he would qualify the 
<br>current situation in Iraq differently than some of his 
<br>colleagues would. He said that two months ago others within 
<br>the GOI believed Al-Qa'ida was finished and argued for the 
<br>removal of T-walls, but that he believed Al-Qa'ida was not 
<br>finished, but rather would spread if left to its own devices. 
<br>Abd al-Mahdi believes the GOI and U.S. government must 
<br>reassess the current security situation in Iraq and the next 
<br>Iraqi government and the U.S. should revise the security 
<br>agreement accordingly, especially in light of recent attacks 
<br>targeting government buildings in the center of Baghdad. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) The Vice President said that logistically and 
<br>strategically we are winning the war, but that all parties 
<br>must remain aware that this reality could shift. Abd 
<br>al-Mahdi stressed that we should not "underestimate our enemy 
<br>or overestimate our forces." He said that with all of the 
<br>positive developments in Iraq, one can see a certain light at 
<br>the end of the tunnel, but that Iraq can do better in all 
<br>areas, from regional relations to countering terrorism. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>SECOND ROUND OF OIL BIDDING, ABSENCE OF U.S. COMPANIES 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) President Talabani expressed disappointment that more 
<br>American companies did not participate in the second round of 
<br>oil biding in Iraq. Talabani said that for many years he has 
<br>encouraged President Bush, and now President Obama, to 
<br>support U.S. companies' investment in Iraq, noting that the 
<br>U.S. administration was always waiting for the Iraqi oil law 
<br>to be adopted by parliament prior to encouraging such 
<br>investment. (Ref B) 
<br>
<br>¶15. (U) CODEL McCain cleared this message.
