<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) BRV reaction to the announcement of Castro's 
<br>illness and recovery directly mirrored that of the Cuban 
<br>regime. There is no reason to believe that the fundamentals 
<br>of the Cuba-Venezuela relationship -- with Venezuela 
<br>providing huge resource flows, and the Cubans providing tens 
<br>of thousands of "advisors" -- will change through the medium 
<br>term. Castro's absence from the scene will deprive Chavez of 
<br>an avuncular presence and a proven crisis manager, which may 
<br>increase Chavez' vulnerability. In the event of Castro's 
<br>permanent departure from the scene, the mercurial Chavez may 
<br>become even more unpredictable. Chavez may believe his 
<br>regime's survival is tied to that of a Castroite successor 
<br>government, and under a conceivable set of circumstances 
<br>might even be willing to deploy Venezuelan military assets in 
<br>support of a successor regime. Embassy believes this would 
<br>be an apt moment to warn the BRV against intervening in Cuba 
<br>during its transition. End summary. 
<br>
<br>Initial BRV Reactions to Castro Announcement 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Initial Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (BRV) 
<br>reaction to the news of Castro's illness and temporary 
<br>hand-over of power has been limited to parroting the Cuban 
<br>line. Speaking on August 1 in Vietnam, Chavez seemed a bit 
<br>taken by surprise and uninformed, but said he had talked to 
<br>Cuban officials who assured him that Castro "would return to 
<br>his job in some weeks." The same day, the Venezuelan Foreign 
<br>Ministry announced that they "had received, with 
<br>satisfaction, news from Cuban authorities" that Castro was 
<br>recuperating. Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel similarly 
<br>said that he spoke with his Cuban counterpart Carlos Lage and 
<br>Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque, who assured him 
<br>that the Cuban leader was recovering normally. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Chavez returned to Caracas on August 3, 
<br>apparently without stopping in Havana. SIMO reports indicate 
<br>that he had wanted to do so, but the Cubans waved him off, 
<br>fearing that his presence would undercut their efforts to 
<br>convey a sense of normality. Chavez got the point; during 
<br>his August 6 "Alo Presidente," Chavez said he had learned out 
<br>that Castro was up and talking, and expressed his confidence 
<br>that the Cuban leader would be back in action soon. 
<br>Interestingly, Chavez did not suggest he'd spoken personally 
<br>to Castro. Too, he engaged in a lengthy digression about his 
<br>appreciation for being able to meet and work with a hero from 
<br>his youth. Certainly it was not his intention, but this part 
<br>of Chavez' comments took on the tone of an elegy. 
<br>
<br>Speculation on Raul-Chavez Relations 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Regardless of whether Fidel is alive or not, it 
<br>would appear that Raul will continue to play a larger role 
<br>than in the past. Public and other sources have included 
<br>speculation about the lack of chemistry between Chavez and 
<br>Raul Castro. While we question the reliability of such 
<br>judgments, because it's unclear to us the basis for reaching 
<br>them, they are worth being aware of. Americo Martin, a 
<br>former Venezuelan Communist close to the Castros in the 
<br>1970s, told El Universal that the younger Castro views Chavez 
<br>with distrust and caution. Former Venezuelan Ambassador and 
<br>ubiquitous international relations analyst Julio Cesar Pineda 
<br>told poloff August 8 that he has heard that Chavez is close 
<br>to FM Perez Roque, and VP Lage, who it would appear are going 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00002367 002.2 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>to continue to play important roles in Cuba. Exiled Cuban 
<br>intellectual Carlos Alberto Montaner probably made the most 
<br>relevant observation in noting that Raul and Chavez lack the 
<br>emotional ties that bind Fidel and Chavez. 
<br>
<br>What Does it Mean for Venezuela? 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) While there are a number of unknowns in the 
<br>equation, there is no reason to believe much will change in 
<br>the bilateral relationship in the short to medium term. Both 
<br>countries derive benefits from the relationship. Cuba 
<br>benefits from the millions in oil and transfer payments for 
<br>services rendered; Venezuela benefits from the advice of 
<br>Castro and tens of thousands of "trainers" and doctors. 
<br>Apparent Cuban influence in Venezuela has grown dramatically, 
<br>to the point that opposition Venezuelans sardonically refer 
<br>to "Venecuba" or "Cubazuela" (both forms are acceptable). 
<br>Chavez relies heavily on Cuban advisors to implement programs 
<br>that are one of the keys to his political success. We assess 
<br>there could be as many as 40,000 Cubans currently in 
<br>Venezuela, managing, guiding, and implementing Chavez' social 
<br>missions (e.g., Barrio Adentro medical program, Mision 
<br>Robinson literacy program, Mercal state-owned grocery chain, 
<br>etc.) Rumors swirl about Cubans taking central roles in 
<br>sensitive government functions, including in Chavez' personal 
<br>security, the military, the National Electoral Council, the 
<br>national identification Office, even land titling offices. 
<br>None of that is going to change soon. The Bolivarian regime 
<br>is deriving political and organizational benefit from it, and 
<br>the Cubans are getting paid hard currency for it. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) We judge that Chavez will also want to continue 
<br>Venezuela's generous petroleum support to Cuba, which we 
<br>currently estimate at 98,000 barrels per day, worth at least 
<br>$7 million a day, or $2.5 billion a year. SIMO reporting 
<br>indicates that Chavez directed that his staff find ways of 
<br>increasing resource flows to Cuba. We can think of two 
<br>motivations Chavez might have in increasing cash flow to 
<br>Cuba: first, to help a friend in need; the one thing he has 
<br>is cash, and he can give more of it. Second, it may also be 
<br>true that Chavez is looking to bump up transfer payments in 
<br>order to increase his influence in Cuba at this critical 
<br>moment. The economic assistance could become a problem, 
<br>however, if the egoistic, increasingly intrusive Chavez used 
<br>it to promote his own candidate in any ensuing power 
<br>struggle, prolonging the infighting and delaying a democratic 
<br>transition. 
<br>
<br>How Does Chavez Act if Castro is Debilitated or Dead? 
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Castro's prolonged convalescence or even death is 
<br>likely to cause headaches for the region and roil bilateral 
<br>relations. Some argue that Castro has had a moderating 
<br>influence on Chavez, and so he'll really let go if Castro is 
<br>gone. The predicate seems wrong to us. It's hard to see 
<br>much moderation in Chavez' recent behavior: open 
<br>interventionism and tendency to pick fights with leaders 
<br>throughout the hemisphere, his embrace of pariah states 
<br>(including especially the vote for Iran at the IAEA and the 
<br>apparent endorsement of the DPRK's July 4 missile launches), 
<br>and his government's relentless assault on basic freedoms 
<br>within Venezuela. It may be closer to the mark to observe 
<br>that Castro is one of the few people who could contradict 
<br>Chavez or give him news he didn't want to hear. We've 
<br>received numerous reports that Chavez is left surrounded by 
<br>yes-men, because he simply won't accept bad news or 
<br>criticism. The absence of Castro -- to Chavez, respected and 
<br>avuncular -- could make the mercurial Chavez even more 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00002367 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>unpredictable and radical. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Over time, Chavez will probably move toward 
<br>assuming the mantle as (in Castro's words) "my successor to 
<br>advance social revolution." Chavez will need to work this 
<br>issue slowly, as he does not wish to suggest prematurely that 
<br>Castro is dead and inadvertently cause problems for -- or 
<br>with -- any successor Castroite regime. That said, Chavez 
<br>has neither the intellectual candlepower nor the 
<br>international environment to replicate Castro's rise to 
<br>international prominence. That doesn't mean he won't try, 
<br>and he'll play his best card -- oil wealth -- whenever he 
<br>needs to. And whatever the force of his arguments, his 
<br>checkbook is going to speak loudly. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) We should be particularly mindful that Chavez 
<br>will be a committed advocate of the continuation of a 
<br>repressive regime in Cuba. Chavez has been on a losing 
<br>streak, with the electoral results in Peru and (it seems) in 
<br>Mexico; were Cuba now to turn toward democracy, Chavez would 
<br>be increasingly isolated as the sole radical leftist in the 
<br>hemisphere. Chavez may believe that the survival of his 
<br>regime is tied to that of the Castro regime. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) There are some even more troubling scenarios 
<br>that one can play out in this regard. Chavez has said as 
<br>recently as this April that he'd be willing to spill 
<br>Venezuelan blood to save the Cuban regime (although he was 
<br>speaking about a U.S. invasion). Were there to be an 
<br>internal civil conflict in Cuba, we believe it possible that 
<br>Chavez would consider intervening militarily on the side of 
<br>pro-regime elements. It is not clear to us that such an 
<br>intervention would be militarily effective, but the presence, 
<br>or even threat, of a Venezuelan force in Cuba would have 
<br>important implications for Cuba and for us. Perhaps the most 
<br>likely scenario would have the Venezuelans providing lift 
<br>capability to loyalist troops; the Venezuelan Armed Force 
<br>(FAV) does retain some fixed-wing and rotary lift capability. 
<br>That said, a Venezuelan navy troopship regularly plies 
<br>between Venezuela and Cuba, and could conceivably be used to 
<br>move FAV troops to the island. 
<br>
<br>(11. (C) Comment: As noted in previous email traffic, 
<br>Embassy suggests that this may be an apt time to warn the BRV 
<br>against intervening in Cuba.) 
<br>
<br>An Achilles' Heel? 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) These are some fairly gloomy scenarios. We can 
<br>conceive how Castro's absence might actually make Chavez more 
<br>vulnerable. Hugo Chavez is a master tactician, regularly 
<br>assessing the domestic political situation better and faster 
<br>than the opposition, and making moves to box in his 
<br>democratic opponents. What Chavez is less good at is crisis 
<br>management. To take a recent example, Chavez' first instinct 
<br>to go to Castro's sickbed was wrong, because it would have 
<br>undercut the regime's "all is well" line. There are 
<br>historical examples, of Chavez cracking under pressure. In 
<br>both the 1992 and the 2002 failed coups, evidence suggests 
<br>that Chavez lost his nerve at key moments. His military 
<br>colleagues were willing to fight on in 1992 when he was holed 
<br>up in the Military Museum, but he surrendered them all. In 
<br>2002, a weepy Chavez was reportedly ready to sign the letter 
<br>of resignation and flee to Cuba. Castro has proved his worth 
<br>to Chavez as a proxy crisis manager. It was Castro who told 
<br>Chavez to fight on in 2002, and it was Castro who worked the 
<br>phones to reassemble a pro-Chavez consensus in the armed 
<br>forces. In 2004, as the recall referendum approached, it was 
<br>Castro who conceived and executed the "misiones" plan to buck 
<br>
<br>CARACAS 00002367 004.2 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>up Chavez' popularity. In Cuba, from the Cuban Missile 
<br>Crisis to Mariel to the Maleconazo to the Special Period, 
<br>Fidel Castro has proven himself to be a superb crisis 
<br>manager. Should Chavez confront a thorny crisis, especially 
<br>a domestic crisis, he may suffer significantly from the loss 
<br>of Castro's steady hand at his back. This, in turn, could be 
<br>an advantage for us in our efforts to urge a return to full 
<br>democracy in Venezuela.<br>
