<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>
<br>¶1. (U) As part of FICOD 2009 (see ref A), on November 18 the 
<br>Spanish government hosted a Conference on IPR in the Digital 
<br>Environment. The Conference featured several speeches and a 
<br>series of roundtables on different aspects of online IPR 
<br>protection. Michele Woods of the U.S Copyright Office was a 
<br>panelist in a roundtable on policies and legislative 
<br>measures. MPAA CEO Dan Glickman delivered remarks outlining 
<br>the rights-holders' point of view. The Conference was 
<br>informative, with high-quality presentations The roundtable 
<br>discussions helped shed light on efforts underway in various 
<br>countries to address the problem of Internet piracy; the 
<br>Conference was thus particularly timely as the GOS is 
<br>expected to unveil a series of measures to combat 
<br>piracy-promoting websites by the end of the year. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) MPAA CEO Glickman told the Charge that his meetings 
<br>with the two Ministers most responsible for combating 
<br>Internet piracy were encouraging. Minister of Industry, 
<br>Tourism, and Trade (MITYC) Miguel Sebastian told Glickman 
<br>unambiguously that the Inter-Ministerial Commission's 
<br>recommendations will include an administrative course of 
<br>action to block or take down pirate websites. MITYC had 
<br>heretofore been believed to oppose such an approach, and 
<br>Sebastian's embrace of it may be a sign that the GOS is 
<br>preparing to implement measures with teeth, though not as 
<br>much as rights-holders would like to see. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) MITYC's Secretariat of State for Telecommunications 
<br>and the Information Society (SETSI) organized the conference 
<br>as part of the third annual FICOD. It opened with an address 
<br>by Paul Brown, Vice-President of Spotify, a free, legal 
<br>online music service that has recently become available in 
<br>Spain and that was also featured recently in Economist 
<br>articles about successes in reducing online music piracy. 
<br>Spotify is supported by advertising revenue or, for those who 
<br>wish to avoid the ads, paid subscriptions. The increased 
<br>prevalence of legitimate vehicles for making content 
<br>available, and the need for much more legal content online as 
<br>a means of reducing the temptation to pirate, were major 
<br>recurring themes of the conference. 
<br>
<br>LEGISLATIVE ISSUES 
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) The roundtable on policies and legislative measures 
<br>included government officials from the U.S., the UK, Germany, 
<br>Sweden, and France, and a WIPO representative. Michele 
<br>Woods, Senior Counsel for Policy and International Affairs at 
<br>the U.S. Copyright Office, discussed the Google Books case, 
<br>its Revised Settlement Agreement, and implications for orphan 
<br>works. Steve Rowan of the UK Intellectual Property Office 
<br>(IPO), reported on recent developments in that country, 
<br>including new draft legislation adopting a "three strikes" 
<br>approach, which involves cutting Internet service to those 
<br>who repeatedly download illegally. Representatives of the 
<br>German and Swiss Justice Ministries addressed various 
<br>enforcement issues, including implementation of the EU 
<br>Enforcement Directive and prosecution of the Pirate Bay 
<br>principals. A French Culture Ministry official updated the 
<br>audience on the HADOPI law, which after many setbacks is to 
<br>take effect at the beginning of the year with the 
<br>promulgation of implementing regulations. It is evident that 
<br>in the United States and many European countries, there is a 
<br>great deal of activity taking place on a variety of fronts. 
<br>
<br>APPROACHES TO COMBATING ONLINE PIRACY 
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) The roundtable on The Fight Against IPR-Infringing 
<br>Activities on the Internet was moderated by Guillermo Corral, 
<br>Director General for Policy and Cultural Industries at the 
<br>Ministry of Culture, who spoke about GOS efforts to encourage 
<br>negotiations between the Coalition of Creators and Content 
<br>Industries and the Internet Service Providers' (ISP) 
<br>association (Redtel). He also alluded to the 
<br>Inter-Ministerial Commission formed October 9 (ref D) to make 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001152 002.3 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>recommendations to the government. The first panelist, Aldo 
<br>Olcese, spoke of changes that have taken place in his first 
<br>year as president of the Coalition, which previously 
<br>consisted of copyright management entities and various film 
<br>and music producers and distributors and audiovisual groups. 
<br>The Spanish Association of Video Game Publishers and 
<br>Distributors (aDeSe) joined the Coalition in January, and 
<br>Spain's major book publishing industry association joined 
<br>later in the year. Awareness on the part of the government 
<br>and the general public has grown, Olcese said, and the 
<br>content providers don't feel as isolated as they did before. 
<br>He characterized continuing efforts to finalize an agreement 
<br>between the Coalition and Redtel as "difficult" and predicted 
<br>that such an agreement will only be realized "at the last 
<br>minute." 
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) Olcese outlined what he called the "Spanish model" for 
<br>combating piracy, a model which he characterized as "more 
<br>democratic" than the approach in other countries, as it seeks 
<br>to reduce online availability of pirated material while 
<br>leaving the end user alone. The Spanish model is focused on 
<br>the producers and distributors of pirated content, the 
<br>pirates' "supermarket." Per ref D, on October 19 the 
<br>Coalition delivered a list of 200 alleged commercial-scale 
<br>pirate websites to the MITYC to be passed to the Prosecutor 
<br>General's Office (Fiscalia) for investigation and 
<br>prosecution, and also urged MITYC to take independent action 
<br>against the sites. (Comment: It remains unclear what 
<br>authority MITYC may have beyond the ability to levy modest 
<br>fines, nor are we aware whether the any GOS entity is 
<br>contemplating action against any of the listed websites. End 
<br>Comment.) At the same time, the Coalition has been actively 
<br>developing a "business model' approach and plans to launch a 
<br>"macro website" to help users in Spain gain access to legal 
<br>content online so that they will be less inclined to download 
<br>it without authorization. Both MITYC and the Ministry of 
<br>Culture have expressed the intention to provide financial 
<br>support to the macroweb. Olcese noted that identifying the 
<br>right mix of incentives and sanctions to deter Internet 
<br>piracy is still a matter of trial and error; nobody knows 
<br>which model will work best. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) Maria Teresa Arcos, Executive Director for ISP 
<br>association Redtel, hailed the creation of the 
<br>Inter-Ministerial Commission and said the ISPs seek the 
<br>continued growth of a legal online market and an end to the 
<br>dichotomy between technology and culture. She also cited the 
<br>European Parliament's recent approval of the telecom package" 
<br>and the importance of finding a balance between competing 
<br>rights. While acknowledging the importance of dissuasive 
<br>measures, Arcos focused on the need for attractive legal 
<br>offer with flexible prices and said Redtel looks forward to 
<br>the launching of the Coalition's macroweb. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Jesus Rubi of the Spanish Data Protection Agency 
<br>(AEPD) stated that data protection is not inimical to 
<br>intellectual property protection. He noted, however, that 
<br>under Spanish law, Internet Protocol addresses and their 
<br>association with individual users are personal data and thus 
<br>protected from disclosure in most circumstances. Under the 
<br>European Court of Justice's January 2008 ruling in Promusicae 
<br>v. Telefonica, ISPs are not required to disclose users' 
<br>identities in civil litigation, and governments are not 
<br>obliged to compel them to do so. Governments are only 
<br>required to seek a balance between privacy and property 
<br>rights. Rubi noted that the Congressional Sub-committee on 
<br>Intellectual Property had recently sent a questionnaire to 
<br>AEPD, which had replied by suggesting several points to be 
<br>taken into account if Congress wishes to consider amending 
<br>existing legislation. 
<br>
<br>RIGHTS-HOLDERS' CONCERNS 
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Juan Junquera, Chief of Staff to Secretary of State 
<br>for Telecommunications and the Information Society Francisco 
<br>Ros, moderated the panel on the rights-holders' point of 
<br>view. Olivia Regnier of the International Federation of 
<br>Phonographic Industries (IFPI) cited figures showing that 95 
<br>percent of peer-to-peer (P2P) downloads of music are 
<br>unauthorized and thus illegal. She also pointed to figures 
<br>showing a steady decline in traditional music sales in Spain 
<br>since 2001 and said called for more cooperation on the part 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001152 003.3 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>of ISPs in combating illicit downloads. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) Dan Glickman, Chairman and CEO of the Motion Picture 
<br>Association of America (MPAA), referred to President 
<br>Zapatero's October 21 speech to the American Business Council 
<br>(ref D) in which he outlined the concerns of both the USG and 
<br>the GOS over IPR protection in Spain. Calling piracy a 
<br>"dagger through the heart" of creators, Glickman noted that 
<br>great quality works of art require both a conduit and an 
<br>artist. The Internet can be a powerful tool for the 
<br>dissemination of culture but also poses unique challenges for 
<br>which there is no magic solution. Voluntary agreements with 
<br>ISPs are welcome but are not enough in themselves; government 
<br>has a necessary role to play. The digital environment will 
<br>continue to grow as a medium for cultural transmission, but 
<br>the physical environment should not be overlooked. The 
<br>notion of "free content," while seductive to some, is an 
<br>invitation to anarchy. Legal online offers of content will 
<br>not work unless they are well-implemented within an adequate 
<br>legal infrastructure. Glickman stressed the importance of a 
<br>constructive, balanced solution and said MPAA looks forward 
<br>to the GOS announcement of concrete measures by year's end. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) Antonio Guisasola of the Music Producers of Spain 
<br>(Promusicae), in an oblique reference to State Secretary 
<br>Ros's characterization (ref E) of Spain's Internet piracy 
<br>problem as an "urban legend," sought to dispel two urban 
<br>legends of his own. The first is that the music industry 
<br>wants to do away with the Internet; the second is that a lack 
<br>of legal online alternatives is the reason piracy flourishes 
<br>in Spain. There are, he said, 370 legal music services in 
<br>Europe, with more appearing all the time. Consumers are able 
<br>to choose from among a range of options and are increasingly 
<br>getting better deals. Guisasola announced the launch of 
<br>Promusicae's own portal, www.elportaldemusica.es, to link 
<br>Spanish users to prominent legal sites. But legal offer, he 
<br>said, is not enough. He cited a Jupiter Research Study 
<br>showing that 32% of users in Spain frequently use P2P 
<br>facilities, compared to an average of 15% for Europe. Of 
<br>those, 52% say that free downloading has reduced their 
<br>purchases of original music. Also, only 32% of Spaniards 
<br>surveyed said they thought P2P activity was illegal, compared 
<br>to 64% in France, 79% in Germany, and 70% in Europe as a 
<br>whole. Guisasola said more cooperation is needed from ISPs, 
<br>and there must be a credible risk of real punishment to deter 
<br>wrongdoers. Carrots can help, but sticks are needed as well. 
<br>Responding to Junquera's reminder that P2P is not illegal 
<br>per se, but is a technology that can be put to legal or 
<br>illegal uses, Guisasola countered that almost all P2P 
<br>downloads of music are illegal. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) During the question-and-answer period, one questioner 
<br>asked whether the Inter-Ministerial Commission will recommend 
<br>dissuasive action only against websites that house infringing 
<br>material, or also against P2P portals. Junquera replied that 
<br>the GOS is constrained from going after P2P activity by the 
<br>basic Constitutional principle protecting private 
<br>communications from government interference. IFPI's Olivia 
<br>Regnier demurred, pointing out that P2P activity is a form of 
<br>public, not private, communication. Junquera, however, 
<br>reiterated that the focus of GOS enforcement efforts will be 
<br>on websites that host or provide links to infringing content. 
<br>He also sought to clarify State Secretary Ros's "urban 
<br>legend" remark, which has been much-criticized by content 
<br>providers. The GOS, he said, does not deny that Internet 
<br>piracy is a serious problem in Spain, deserving of government 
<br>attention. The GOS does, however, take issue with assertions 
<br>that Spain has significantly higher rates of Internet piracy 
<br>than its European neighbors, and that it is among the worst 
<br>in the world in this regard. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (U) The Conference included one final roundtable, on 
<br>implications for IPR of online social networks, and a speech 
<br>by Duke University Law Professor James Boyle. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Though 2009 has been a frustrating year for 
<br>right-holders, there is a good chance it will end on a 
<br>positive note. In a meeting with Charge, MPAA CEO Dan 
<br>Glickman expressed satisfaction with his meetings with 
<br>Industry, Tourism, and Trade Minister Miguel Sebastian and 
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001152 004.3 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>Minister of Culture Angeles Gonzalez-Sinde. Sebastian, he 
<br>said, was quite forthright and specific about the 
<br>Commission's work: It will deliver its recommendations by 
<br>year's end; these will include amending the law to give 
<br>government more tools to combat piracy; and one component 
<br>will be "an administrative course of action" to block 
<br>offending websites. According to various sources, State 
<br>Secretary Ros (who reports to Sebastian and was present at 
<br>his meeting with Glickman) and his staffers had been opposing 
<br>such an administrative remedy in the Commission's discussions 
<br>(refs B-C), but have apparently been brought around by the 
<br>other Ministries represented. Rights-holders, however, 
<br>remain concerned that the government may implement only 
<br>half-measures. Promusicae staged a demonstration in front of 
<br>MITYC on December 1 and presented Minister Sebastian with a 
<br>peition signed by 2,500 music professionals calling on the 
<br>government to take "valiant measures, as the French and 
<br>British governments have already done, to protect their 
<br>culture and jobs." End Comment.
