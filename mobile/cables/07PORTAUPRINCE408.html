<br>
<br>Classified By: Classified by Ambassador Janet A. Sanderson for reasons 
<br>1.4(b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Introduction: Reftel asks for a comprehensive 
<br>assessment of President Preval's decision-making process and 
<br>leadership style. As noted in reftel, post has reported on 
<br>many of the specific topics inquired about over the course of 
<br>Preval's re-election campaign and the first year of his 
<br>second term. We welcome the opportunity to reiterate key 
<br>judgments that we believe will become increasingly important 
<br>as the Preval administration approaches completion of its 
<br>first year in office. In sum, we believe Preval's commitment 
<br>to building democratic institutions, promoting political 
<br>stability, and developing the economy corresponds with our 
<br>own interests. However, Preval's weaknesses as an executive, 
<br>his reflexive nationalism, and his disinterest in managing 
<br>bilateral relations in a broad diplomatic sense, will lead to 
<br>periodic frictions as we move forward our bilateral agenda. 
<br>Case in point, we believe that in terms of foreign policy, 
<br>Preval is most interested in gaining increased assistance 
<br>from any available resource. He is likely to be tempted to 
<br>frame his relationship with Venezuela and Chavez-allies in 
<br>the hemisphere in a way that he hopes will create a 
<br>competitive atmosphere as far as who can provide the most to 
<br>Haiti. Additionally, Preval has displayed a tendency to 
<br>fixate on a particular issue at the exclusion of all others 
<br>and then to move on to other issues without leaving much to 
<br>show for his efforts. Since taking office in May 2006, 
<br>Preval has been the education president, the roads president, 
<br>and now the anti-narcotics president. All of these issues 
<br>are worthy of his time and attention, but require a coherent 
<br>approach to policy implementation in addition to rhetoric. 
<br>End Introduction. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) The answers below are keyed to the questions in 
<br>reftel: 
<br>
<br>Question A 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) How Does Preval make policy decisions? What sources 
<br>of information does Preval draw from when making decisions 
<br>and how does he process that information, e.g. is he 
<br>receptive new information, does he seek advice or rely on his 
<br>own intuition? Does Preval tend to see policy issues in 
<br>black and white or in shades of grey? 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) We judge that Preval largely relies on his own 
<br>intuition and experience in formulating policy. We see that 
<br>experiences from his first presidential term are nearly 
<br>always a touchstone on key bilateral issues, even when 
<br>circumstances have significantly changed or the conclusion he 
<br>is drawing is not directly applicable to the issue at hand. 
<br>Preval's recent insistence that the U.S. does not do enough 
<br>to combat narcotics traffic through Haiti is a clear example 
<br>of an attitude carried over from his first term. Likewise, 
<br>Preval's current resistance to making a placating gesture to 
<br>China after the GoH voiced support for Taiwan at the UN is 
<br>based in part on Preval's belief that China behaved 
<br>unreasonably when renewing UN mission mandates during his 
<br>first term. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) On balance, we see that issues where Preval has a 
<br>fixed view, for example relations with China, he is 
<br>remarkably resistant to policy advice. On other issues, 
<br>where Preval is not so engaged either because of lack of 
<br>personal interest or lack of experience, Preval seems readily 
<br>open to new information and flexible in his approach. This 
<br>seems most apparent in issues relating to economic policy. 
<br>Rather than separating Preval's thinking into black and white 
<br>or shades of gray, we believe it is more useful to bear in 
<br>mind that Preval often appears not to fully think through the 
<br>implications or consequences of a particular issue. He 
<br>neglects to carry out the kind of study or put in place the 
<br>administrative structure required to turn an idea into 
<br>workable policy. This was most obvious in his approach to 
<br>negotiations with gang leaders, his focus throughout the 
<br>
<br>PORT AU PR 00000408 002 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>summer of 2006. Due to a lack of results however, he 
<br>abandoned the effort. Preval's entire policy seemed to be 
<br>encapsulated in the formulation, ''disarm or die.'' He 
<br>never appears to have coherently addressed the issue central 
<br>to the negotiations -- the future of the most violent 
<br>gang-leaders. 
<br>
<br>Question B 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Does Preval seek advice from a wide array of sources 
<br>or only look to certain people, if so, whom and on what 
<br>issues? Does he trust any of his advisers or ministers to 
<br>make key decisions in his stead? How does he deal with 
<br>dissension or criticism from his advisors? What tone does he 
<br>set when he meets with his advisers - e.g., does he encourage 
<br>them to work collegially, competitively, or within the formal 
<br>bureaucratic structure? Has Bob Manuel's influence with 
<br>Preval diminished, and if so, why? Does Manuel continue to 
<br>informally oversee the security portfolio? If not, who does, 
<br>is there another adviser poised to succeed Manuel as Preval's 
<br>''right-hand man.''? 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Preval seems open to a wide array of sources -- he 
<br>reportedly reads and pays attention to the media on a wide 
<br>variety of subjects and maintains a broad circle of friends 
<br>-- but appears to limit the number of people from whom he 
<br>actively seeks advice. Some, most notably Robert Manuel, 
<br>have complained that the number is growing smaller and that 
<br>his fiancee, Elizabeth Delatour, is the only advisor with 
<br>whom he has meaningful discussions. Fritz Longchamp, 
<br>Secretary General of the Presidency, appears to have gained 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>access and influence to Preval regarding the dispute with 
<br>China. As a former foreign minister, Longchamp may also be 
<br>advising on broader foreign policy issues. Gabriel Verret 
<br>remains Preval's closest advisor on economic issues. Lionel 
<br>Delatour, Elizabeth Delatour's brother-in-law, maintains 
<br>somewhat regular access due to his family ties and his direct 
<br>involvement with the effort to promote HOPE legislation, 
<br>however Delatour himself has complained that Preval often 
<br>ignores his advice. With a few exceptions, Preval appears 
<br>not to trust his advisers or ministers to make key decisions, 
<br>or even to implement key decisions. The most recent account 
<br>of the council of ministers meetings provided by Gabriel 
<br>Verret to the Ambassador describes Preval going through the 
<br>action items of each ministry and demanding status reports. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) With the Embassy and USG representatives, ministers as 
<br>a group are deferential and mostly subdued in Preval's 
<br>presence. There is little air of give-and-take or 
<br>willingness among ministers to extemporize. In meetings with 
<br>USG officials Preval has abruptly cut off Prime Minister 
<br>Alexis on two occasions, disagreeing with his views. On 
<br>another occasion he cut off Minister of Public Works Frantz 
<br>Varella, who had offered an observation regarding security, 
<br>telling him that security was not his responsibility. We 
<br>hear of very little, if any, substantive criticism or 
<br>dissension among the cabinet in private. The most visible 
<br>intra-cabinet dissension, so far, has been between the 
<br>judiciary and security officials; most recently, a rift 
<br>between the justice minister and chief prosecutor Claudy 
<br>Gassant. Preval has pointedly refused to intervene. Many 
<br>among Haiti's chattering classes attribute this to a strategy 
<br>on Preval's part to keep members of his government divided 
<br>and weak. We judge rather that his attitude is more in line 
<br>with his overall passivity as an executive. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Having observed the Preval-Manuel relationship over 
<br>the past two years since Manuel's return to Haiti to join the 
<br>Preval campaign, we judge that Manuel's role is most 
<br>accurately described as Best Friend. Manuel remains Preval's 
<br>closest confidante, and Preval still uses him as his personal 
<br>emissary, but the influence of Manuel's own views on any 
<br>given subject appear limited. For example, against Manuel's 
<br>advice and own wishes, Preval involved Manuel in his first 
<br>negotiations with gang leaders in the summer of 2006. With 
<br>Manuel's displeasure with this policy unabated, Preval simply 
<br>cut him out of the process. Manuel appears still to be 
<br>charged with the management of Preval's personal security, 
<br>
<br>PORT AU PR 00000408 003 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>overseeing the Presidential Protection Unit (USPN) in the 
<br>palace, but Preval himself appears to have taken complete 
<br>charge of security policy. Manuel, along with the justice 
<br>minister, is charged with preparing President Preval for the 
<br>upcoming drug trafficking summit in the Dominican Republic on 
<br>March 16, but our contacts with Manuel on narcotics issues so 
<br>far indicate that he does no more than to restate Preval's 
<br>own views, often with more passion. Manuel confided to the 
<br>Ambassador that he is frustrated with Preval's unwillingness 
<br>to listen to him and heed advice and that he wants to leave 
<br>Haiti, preferably as Ambassador to Mexico, but that Preval 
<br>has been non-committal about the timing of his appointment. 
<br>Whatever the state of their relationship on policy issues, 
<br>Preval clearly values Manuel's friendship and may be 
<br>reluctant to let him go. 
<br>
<br>Question C 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) What is the nature of Preval's relationship with 
<br>Director General of the Haitian National Police Mario 
<br>Andresol, Foreign Minister Jean Reynald Clerisme, Secretary 
<br>of State for Public Security Luc Eucher Joseph, Secretary 
<br>General of the Presidency Fritz Longchamp, and economic 
<br>advisor Gabriel Verret. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Preval's relationship with Andresol does not appear 
<br>to extend beyond their formal association as president and 
<br>the chief of police. Preval and Andresol had no personal 
<br>connection to speak of before Preval inherited and then 
<br>re-appointed Andresol director general of the HNP. For his 
<br>part, Andresol has, on several occasions, expressed 
<br>frustration that he has not been able to gain more trust from 
<br>Preval. Likewise, Preval's relationship with Eucher seems 
<br>limited to their formal roles: Eucher is not otherwise a 
<br>close of advisor from whom Preval seeks counsel. Preval and 
<br>Clerisme have a large number of mutual acquaintances from the 
<br>rural/populist movements, however they do not have a close 
<br>personal bond. Preval has reportedly taken personal charge of 
<br>all important foreign policy issues, leaving Clerisme with 
<br>little influence. Longchamp is both a trusted advisor and 
<br>personal friend. With Preval limiting PM Alexis' direction 
<br>of the cabinet, and not having named a chief of staff, the 
<br>importance of Longchamp's position has steadily increased. 
<br>Finally, Gabriel Verret, perhaps even more than either Robert 
<br>Manuel or Longchamp, is the other advisor in the palace who 
<br>can claim to be both a trusted confidante and influential 
<br>policy advisor, as Preval remains open to advice on economic 
<br>matters. In the same way, Elizabeth Delatour, who is also 
<br>formally charged with providing economic advice, might be the 
<br>single most important influence on Preval. 
<br>
<br>Question D 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) What are Alexis and Foreign Minister Clerisme's 
<br>perceptions of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide? 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Based on Alexis' long-standing personal association 
<br>with Preval from his previous administration through his 
<br>active role in the most recent presidential campaign, we 
<br>surmise that Alexis' views on Aristide hew closely to 
<br>Preval's own (i.e. that Aristide betrayed the Haitian 
<br>people). If Alexis believes otherwise, he gives no hint of 
<br>disagreement with Preval. We are less familiar with 
<br>Clerisme, but note that Clerisme's political engagement began 
<br>with his involvement as a liberation theology priest working 
<br>in the rural, peasant movement in Haiti's northeast. Most of 
<br>this movement's leaders became disillusioned with Aristide 
<br>during the mid-1990's. Whatever Clerisme's views, as with 
<br>Alexis, to the extent they do not correspond to Preval's, he 
<br>keeps them to himself. 
<br>
<br>Question E 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Is Preval influenced by ideology, and if so, what are 
<br>the major influences? What motivated him to return to 
<br>politics? What role do Catholicism, voodoo, and 
<br>
<br>PORT AU PR 00000408 004 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>liberation-theology play in his worldview? What is his full 
<br>educational history and experience working in private 
<br>industry? 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Preval seems profoundly uninfluenced and uninterested 
<br>in ideology at this stage in his life. Despite his 
<br>involvement in radical/communist circles as a student in 
<br>Belgium and his entrance into Haitian politics through a 
<br>populist movement deeply influenced by liberation theology, 
<br>Preval's public and private discourse is practically devoid 
<br>of any notions reflecting that background. In the context of 
<br>the developing world, we would most accurately describe him 
<br>as a neo-liberal, particularly in that he has embraced free 
<br>markets and foreign investment. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) At the same time, Preval's discourse regarding 
<br>Haitian politics remains framed in the context of his past. 
<br>He still refers broadly to ''the people'' and ''the 
<br>bourgeois'' in referring to Haitian society. His leftist 
<br>views reportedly caused a deep rift between himself and his 
<br>family, particularly his father, who although opposed to 
<br>Duvalier held traditional Haitian upper-class views. This is 
<br>as close to an insight as we may venture into his motivation 
<br>to return to politics, which is something of a puzzle. While 
<br>a canny politician and an effective campaigner Preval evinces 
<br>little of the ambition or overt drive typical of most 
<br>politicians. It may be simply that he rightly recognized 
<br>that he was the only leader in Haiti who legitimately 
<br>represented the broad-based popular movement that toppled 
<br>Duvalier and first brought Aristide to power. 
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Like most Haitians, Preval was raised Catholic with 
<br>an exposure to voodoo practices. He is a non-observant 
<br>Catholic but maintains a cordial and respectful relationship 
<br>with Haiti's Catholic hierarchy. He is particularly close to 
<br>Haiti's Archbishop, who was a life-long friend of his 
<br>parents. Likewise, he maintains a respectful and cordial 
<br>relationship with Voodoo leaders. There are unconfirmed 
<br>reports that Robert Manuel, who is a born-again Christian, 
<br>influences Preval's religious views and that the two 
<br>regularly pray together. However, Preval has been jocular 
<br>and once dismissive of Manuel's praying in conversations with 
<br>ambassadors. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Preval's educational and professional experiences 
<br>listed in open sources are mostly accurate. He studied 
<br>agronomy at the University of Louvain in Belgium but did not 
<br>receive a degree reportedly because he spent too much time 
<br>participating in political activities. Though he obtained a 
<br>position with the National Institute for Mineral Resources, 
<br>apparently as part of Jean-Claude Duvalier's conciliatory 
<br>gestures to his father's opponents, Embassy sources do not 
<br>believe he actually worked at his job. He went into the 
<br>bakery business with several friends in the mid-1970, 
<br>including Michele Pierre Louis, a renowned patron of Haitian 
<br>arts, and through her met Aristide. Preval's bakery was 
<br>successful, but destroyed by associates of the military after 
<br>the 1991 coup d'etat. Among the many incidents of conflict 
<br>between the right-wing and Aristide supporters, Preval 
<br>apparently holds a special grudge against those who destroyed 
<br>his business. 
<br>
<br>Question F 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) What is Preval's relationship to Geri Benoit? Does 
<br>his sister, Marie-Claude Calvin, play an influential role in 
<br>his administration? Does Elizabeth Delatour yield influence 
<br>over Preval's political decision-making? What is the status 
<br>of their impending nuptials? One of Preval's daughters lives 
<br>with him in Port-au-Prince. Where is the other and what does 
<br>she do? 
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) Though Preval and his second wife, Geri Benoit, 
<br>appeared together at times during the campaign, they have 
<br>apparently lived entirely separate lives since his 
<br>inauguration. Mrs. Calvin and Preval are very close. She 
<br>was among the family members on the payroll at his 
<br>agricultural foundation in Marmalade, which was funded by 
<br>
<br>PORT AU PR 00000408 005 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>Taiwan. Calvin acts as his scheduler, keeps an office in the 
<br>palace, and one ambassador reports that Calvin kept him at 
<br>bay for several days when he had an urgent request to see 
<br>Preval. Calvin and her husband also accompanied Preval on 
<br>his second trip to Cuba for medical attention. Mrs. Calvin 
<br>does not appear to play any role in influencing government 
<br>policy. 
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) It is difficult to assess Elizabeth Delatour's 
<br>influence on policy. She is extremely private and reserved 
<br>and does not generally engage foreign officials in 
<br>substantive conversation. She politely resisted the 
<br>Ambassador's attempts to establish a more social 
<br>relationship. Numerous people close to Preval complain that 
<br>Preval has neglected both his work and limited the input of 
<br>other advisors in favor of Delatour. During the critical 
<br>juncture over the dispute with China regarding the renewal of 
<br>MINUSTAH's mandate, Delatour appeared to play a central role. 
<br>SRSG Mulet chose Delatour as his contact when he argued that 
<br>the GoH must provide China some kind of written apology: 
<br>Preval ultimately grudgingly signed a letter. Delatour 
<br>called the Ambassador in Washington when she was in the 
<br>Department for consultations asking for an update on the 
<br>Chinese delegation's position in New York. Preval's wedding 
<br>plans remain perhaps the best kept secret in Haiti. We have 
<br>confirmed from multiple reliable sources that they are 
<br>formally engaged, but no further reliable news regarding 
<br>wedding plans has emerged. Factors that might be 
<br>complicating their plans include Preval's health and living 
<br>arrangements for Delatour's 11-year old son. 
<br>
<br>¶22. (C) Preval's older daughter, Dominique, lives with her 
<br>mother in Port-au-Prince and runs a stationery store above 
<br>her mother's book store. She is close to both her parents. 
<br>Preval's younger daughter, Patricia, is currently in Sri 
<br>Lanka studying Asian art. 
<br>
<br>Question G 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶23. (C) How much importance does Preval place on maintaining 
<br>close bilateral relations with the United States? Are there 
<br>aspects of the relationship he values more than others? Does 
<br>he view it as a mutually beneficial relationship? Does he 
<br>see Haiti as having obligations or responsibilities to the 
<br>U.S.? How does he view the U.S.' previous involvement in 
<br>Haiti? What is Preval's relationship with the Haitian 
<br>Diaspora? 
<br>
<br>¶24. (C) Preval recognizes that the U.S. is Haiti's most 
<br>important bilateral partner and that Haiti's closest societal 
<br>links internationally are with the U.S. His priority on the 
<br>bilateral agenda is to leverage and extract the most 
<br>assistance for Haiti on his own terms and to tap into the 
<br>wealth and resources of the Haitian-American community in the 
<br>U.S. As the president of a small, poor nation in the shadow 
<br>of the American behemoth, he clearly believes that the U.S. 
<br>has far greater obligations to Haiti than the other way 
<br>around, if, in fact, Haiti has any obligations at all. 
<br>Preval numbers a few close friends in the diaspora of whom we 
<br>know. He established a friendship with Dumarsais Simeus 
<br>during the presidential campaign, and they stay in contact by 
<br>email. For the most part, however, Preval does not seem 
<br>closely connected to or interested in Haitian communities 
<br>abroad. He has indicated on a number of occasions that he 
<br>fears that pro-Aristide extremists exert excessive influence 
<br>in diaspora communities. 
<br>
<br>Question H 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶25. (C) Are cabinet officials involved in any illicit 
<br>activities? How does Preval handle corruption within his 
<br>administration? 
<br>
<br>¶26. (C) There has been little indication that cabinet members 
<br>have been involved in illicit activities so far. At the time 
<br>of the cabinet's formation, observers noted that the 
<br>ministers had been mostly free of suspicion over the course 
<br>
<br>PORT AU PR 00000408 006 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>of their careers. Indications regarding Preval's own 
<br>attitude toward corruption are mixed. During his first term, 
<br>Preval either tolerated or was forced to accept gross abuses 
<br>on the part of close associates of Aristide. In either case, 
<br>Preval has exhibited a non-confrontational approach with 
<br>passivity toward difficult issues as the hallmark of his 
<br>political career. Preval maintains a reputation for personal 
<br>honesty. 
<br>
<br>Question I 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶27. (C) How has Preval handled domestic criticism thus far? 
<br>Does he have a public communications or publicity strategy or 
<br>manager? How does he perform under significant stress? How 
<br>does he respond to confrontation, either personally or 
<br>indirectly, e.g. mass unrest? 
<br>
<br>¶28. (C) Preval has been remarkably impervious and 
<br>unresponsive to domestic criticism thus far, which mostly 
<br>centers on his approach to security and the gang activity 
<br>during the fall of 2006, when kidnapping and crime spiked 
<br>upward. There have been no significant incidents of mass 
<br>unrest since his inauguration on which to judge his reaction. 
<br>Based on his intense involvement in the daily review of 
<br>security policy, we surmise that he pays close attention to 
<br>public opinion, even if remaining uncommunicative himself. 
<br>He has a palace spokesman in name, Assad Volce but hardly 
<br>uses him. Nor does he use the minister for communication, 
<br>who is traditionally the government's chief spokesperson. 
<br>Regarding his public relations strategy, he has said on 
<br>several occasions, that he wants to change the tradition of 
<br>Haiti's presidents being the center of attention who make 
<br>promises that they are unable to deliver. ''I will talk when 
<br>I have some accomplishments to talk about.'' 
<br>
<br>Question J 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶29. (C) What is the status of Preval's Lespwa coalition? Is 
<br>it a cohesive coalition or is it fractured? Do its members 
<br>regard Preval as their leader? What is Preval's relationship 
<br>to Fanmi Lavalas (FL)? 
<br>
<br>¶30. (C) Preval has removed himself from involvement in Lespwa 
<br>and undertakes little visible role in managing relations with 
<br>the parliament. Lespwa is directionless as a party. Though, 
<br>in the general, Lespwa's drift does not particularly stand 
<br>out in the incohesive atmosphere of Haiti's parliament. 
<br>Senate President Joseph Lambert, has emerged as a leader 
<br>among Lespwa parliamentarians, but devotes more of his energy 
<br>to cultivating his image as parliament's chief, rather than 
<br>simply a party leader. No other Lespwa parliamentarian has 
<br>demonstrated a capacity to take direction of the party. 
<br>Lespwa parliamentarians no longer regard Preval as their 
<br>party leader, but recognizing he remains the country's most 
<br>popular politician and still associated with Lespwa in the 
<br>public's mind, they do not generally criticize him in public 
<br>or in private. Preval has virtually no contact with any of 
<br>the various FL factions. 
<br>
<br>Question K 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶31. (C) How long are Preval's workdays? How many breaks does 
<br>he take during his workday, what does he do during them and 
<br>how long do they last? Under what circumstances? 
<br>
<br>¶32. (C) Preval appears to be keeping an increasingly busy 
<br>schedule, working longer hours and seeing more visitors. The 
<br>Ambassador has taken phone calls from him as early as 6:30 am 
<br>and has had meetings as late as 6:30 pm. Preval told the 
<br>Ambassador recently that he has for many years taken a full, 
<br>in-pajamas 2-3 hour nap every afternoon, allowing him to 
<br>maintain his energy. 
<br>
<br>Question L 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>PORT AU PR 00000408 007 OF 007 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶33. (S/NF) What family history of alcohol or substance use 
<br>does Preval have? What alcohol or drugs has he been observed 
<br>using, how much, and under what circumstances? Any related 
<br>problems? Has Preval ever been observed to be high or drunk, 
<br>disoriented, trembling or physically jittery, or had memory 
<br>lapses? How many drinks can Preval consume before he shows 
<br>signs of inebriation? Does Preval take any medications? 
<br>
<br>¶34. (S/NF) Preval's parents both lived well into their 
<br>eighties. His father, in particular, reportedly enjoyed 
<br>robust health. No one in his immediate family has or had a 
<br>reputation for alcohol abuse. Preval drinks whiskey and 
<br>smokes in public, including at Embassy functions, but we have 
<br>not observed him inebriated nor seen him take more than one 
<br>or two drinks. Rumors abound about his deteriorating 
<br>physical condition -- intense physical pain, high dosages of 
<br>medication, however; we have no credible first-hand reports 
<br>to confirm this. In our meetings Preval has always been 
<br>completely lucid and has never appeared to be in any great 
<br>pain. Special intelligence indicates that he began taking 
<br>medication after the most recent round of medical 
<br>examinations in Cuba that indicated a possibility of the 
<br>return of prostate cancer.
