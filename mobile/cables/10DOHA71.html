<br>SUBJECT: SENATOR KERRY'S MEETING WITH QATAR'S PRIME MINISTER 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Joseph E. LeBaron, for reasons 1.4 (b, d). 
<br> 
<br>-------------- 
<br>(C) KEY POINTS 
<br>-------------- 
<br> 
<br>--  Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani (HBJ) told 
<br>Senator John Kerry February 13 that we will all lose us 4-6 
<br>months of time in pursuing the recently announced "proximity 
<br>talks" between the Israelis and Palestinians. 
<br> 
<br>--  HBJ underscored that it is a mistake to ignore Hamas in 
<br>seeking a lasting agreement. 
<br> 
<br>--  From Qatar's perspective, there are differences in style 
<br>and approaches between the two wings of Hamas, but in 
<br>principle both are fundamentally aligned.  Hamas leaders in 
<br>Damascus and Gaza can accept recognition of Israel, but must 
<br>calibrate the timing very carefully because Hamas supporters 
<br>are not ready for this change. 
<br> 
<br>--  According to HBJ, Egypt has a vested interest in dragging 
<br>out Palestinian reconciliation talks for as long as possible. 
<br> Egypt "has no end game; serving as broker of the talks is 
<br>Egypt's only business interest with the U.S." 
<br> 
<br>--  The Prime Minister suggested that one or two GCC members, 
<br>Morocco, and Syria form the core membership of an Arab League 
<br>committee to address Palestinian-Israeli concerns.  Giving 
<br>Syria a role would create jealousy among the Arabs, which HBJ 
<br>said would help the U.S. move talks forward. 
<br> 
<br>--  HBJ said putting economic pressure on Iran by targeting 
<br>its oil revenues is the best way to get Tehran to rethink its 
<br>quest for nuclear weapons.  For the sanctions to work, it 
<br>would be vital that Russia and other countries bordering Iran 
<br>implement them fully. 
<br> 
<br>End Key Points. 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C)  The Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
<br>Committee (SFRC), Senator John Kerry (D-MA), accompanied by 
<br>Ambassador, P/E Chief and SFRC staff Frank Lowenstein and 
<br>Fatema Sumar, met February 13 with Prime Minister (and 
<br>Foreign Minister) of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani 
<br>(HBJ).  HBJ opened the meeting by observing that President 
<br>Obama's presidency had brought a lot of optimism to the 
<br>region.  Senator Kerry agreed, adding that now we "need to 
<br>deliver." 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>PROXIMITY TALKS NOT HELPFUL 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) HBJ expressed dissatisfaction that "everyone in the 
<br>region" seems to have a separate plan for moving ahead on the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian dispute when only one plan was needed -- 
<br>a plan that both the Israelis and Palestinians would accept 
<br>and finalize.  More disconcerting to Qatar, he said, was the 
<br>announcement by Special Envoy Mitchell that both parties 
<br>would now engage in "proximity talks."  Such talks "will lose 
<br>us 4-6 months of time," stated HBJ. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Senator Kerry responded that we "are where we are." 
<br>He assessed that the Goldstone Report and dissatisfaction in 
<br>Fatah's ranks in the West Bank made it difficult for Abu 
<br>Mazen to "give something to Israel" that would allow direct 
<br>negotiations to begin between the parties.  Add in Abu 
<br>Mazen's previous statements on the need for a full settlement 
<br>freeze, and the ingredients for the Palestinian people to 
<br>accept direct talks simply are not there. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Abu Mazen is out on a limb, responded HBJ.  "He 
<br>climbed a tree (drawing a line in the sand on settlements) 
<br>and can't get down."  HBJ suggested that President Obama's 
<br>address to the UN General Assembly at the opening of its 
<br>current session could serve as a "roadmap" forward:  two 
<br>states (Israel and Palestine) remain the goal, and the 
<br>establishment of settlements must stop while negotiations 
<br>take place.  HBJ stressed again that the "proximity talks" 
<br>will cause a "lot of problems." 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>NEED FOR PALESTINIAN RECONCILIATION 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) HBJ told Chairman Kerry he had met recently in Doha 
<br>with an Israeli delegation and had encouraged them to work 
<br>with Palestinians of all stripes in the pursuit of peace. 
<br>HBJ underscored that it is a mistake to work with just one 
<br>partner, Fatah, and ignore Hamas.  Saying this does not mean 
<br> 
<br>DOHA 00000071  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>that Qatar expresses a preference for Hamas.  HBJ pointed out 
<br>that Abu Mazen had taught in Qatar for 30 years and remains a 
<br>friend of Qatar.  Qatar has no differences with him or those 
<br>around him, but the Palestinian Authority (PA) cannot sign 
<br>off on an agreement on behalf of the Palestinians where open 
<br>divisions exist. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) HBJ noted that in conversations Qatar has held with 
<br>Hamas' leadership, it is clear that Hamas is ready to accept 
<br>Israel's right to exist.  But the acceptance must come about 
<br>gradually, not in one day.  Senator Kerry said he had heard 
<br>this elsewhere, but in his own conversations in Damascus -- 
<br>where a many leaders of Hamas reside -- he did not get the 
<br>sense that Hamas was ready to accept Israel's existence. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) Qatar's PM observed that the biggest obstacle on the 
<br>Palestinian side to an eventual agreement with Israel is the 
<br>reconciliation of Hamas and Fatah.  HBJ maintained that it 
<br>would have happened during the previous U.S. administration, 
<br>but President Bush told Abu Mazen not to sign off on it. 
<br>Now, said HBJ, progress is slow, and bringing the two parties 
<br>together in the spirit of reconciliation is hampered by Arab 
<br>politics.  Reconciliation can happen, HBJ asserted, but only 
<br>"if bigger countries in the region allow it." 
<br> 
<br>8, (C) Senator Kerry, noting that he had seen Yasser Arafat 
<br>make the transition from PLO fighter to signer of an 
<br>agreement on the White House lawn, observed that people can 
<br>come around and change their position.  But was that the case 
<br>here?  The Senator asked HBJ if the differences at play 
<br>between Hamas' leaders in Damascus and Gaza were too wide to 
<br>bridge. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) From HBJ's perspective, there are differences in style 
<br>and approaches between the two wings of Hamas, but in 
<br>principle both are fundamentally aligned.  They can accept 
<br>recognition of Israel, but have to calibrate the timing very 
<br>carefully because Hamas knows that its supporters in the 
<br>Palestinian territories are not ready for this change.  HBJ 
<br>said Hamas leaders in Damascus and Gaza are aligned on 
<br>wanting to open the border crossing at Rafah, for example, 
<br>but differ on tactics in reaching this goal.  The leaderships 
<br>in Syria and Gaza consult each other, and no one leader in 
<br>Hamas can take a decision alone, reported HBJ. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>EGYPT INTERESTED IN THE PROCESS, NOT RESULTS 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Chairman Kerry asked HBJ if Hamas is feeling 
<br>political pressure from Gazans over their current living 
<br>conditions.  HBJ responded that anytime people do not have 
<br>housing, schools or public utilities, their political leaders 
<br>feel pressure.  Hamas, however, has a greater sense of 
<br>urgency in reconciling with Fatah, observed HBJ, than does 
<br>the broker of the talks between the Palestinian parties. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) According to HBJ, Egypt -- the broker -- has a vested 
<br>interest in dragging out the talks for as long as possible. 
<br>Egypt "has no end game; serving as broker of the talks is 
<br>Egypt's only business interest with the U.S."  HBJ likened 
<br>the situation to a physician who has only one patient to 
<br>treat in the hospital.  If that is your only business, "the 
<br>physician is going to keep the patient alive but in the 
<br>hospital for as long as possible."  HBJ emphasized that 
<br>Qatar, on the other hand, is interested only in bringing 
<br>about peace in the region -- and as quickly as possible. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (C) Short term, HBJ said Hamas wants to form with Fatah a 
<br>unity government and rebuild the Israeli-inflicted damage in 
<br>Gaza.  Senator Kerry, steering the conversation toward Hamas' 
<br>long-term aims, acknowledged that Qatar's leaders speak 
<br>frequently with Hamas.  The Chairman asked HBJ to explain why 
<br>Hamas does not seem "to move when we need Hamas to move." 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (C) Simply put, answered HBJ, "Hamas does not trust Egypt 
<br>and the Quartet enterprise."  HBJ noted that since its 
<br>inception the Quartet has been anti-Hamas and aligned with 
<br>the interests of Abu Mazen, Egypt and Jordan.  These partners 
<br>of the Quartet, observed HBJ, are the very partners who have 
<br>not delivered a Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (C) Returning to his theme that "peace brokers" act in 
<br>their own self-interest, HBJ observed that President Mubarak 
<br>of Egypt is thinking about how his son can take his place and 
<br>how to stave off the growing strength of the Muslim 
<br>Brotherhood.  The Egyptian government, said HBJ, has jailed 
<br>10,000 Muslim Brotherhood members without bringing court 
<br>cases against them.  The Egyptian "people blame America" now 
<br>for their plight.  The shift in mood on the ground is "mostly 
<br>because of Mubarak and his close ties" to the United States. 
<br> 
<br>DOHA 00000071  003 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>His only utility to the U.S. is brokering peace between 
<br>Palestinians and Israelis, so he has no interest in taking 
<br>himself out of the one game he has, underscored HBJ.  "Tell 
<br>your friends (in Egypt) they must help themselves." 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (C) As for Qatar, "We want to help Abu Mazen and the 
<br>Palestinians," declared HBJ.  The short-term needs of 
<br>Palestinians in Gaza are acute, said HBJ.  We need to broker 
<br>a quick reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah and move 
<br>forward quickly on rebuilding Gaza.  Senator Kerry asserted 
<br>that HBJ was preaching to the converted and told the PM he 
<br>was "shocked by what I saw in Gaza." 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (C) Continuing to illustrate how Egypt had not delivered 
<br>for the U.S. on Palestinian issues, HBJ said Qatar was told 
<br>in late 2008 that Israel and the U.S. needed the Egyptians to 
<br>deal with the crisis in Gaza.  Yet former Israeli PM Olmert 
<br>later complained to Qatar that Egypt is a big country and not 
<br>nimble; it could not move fast enough.  Senator Kerry pointed 
<br>out he was in Cairo at the time Qatar was calling for an Arab 
<br>League Summit in December 2008/January 2009 and asked HBJ for 
<br>his perspective on the rift between Qatar and Egypt at that 
<br>time. 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (C) HBJ told Senator Kerry that Mubarak refused to come 
<br>to Doha for a meeting of Arab leaders, preferring that the 
<br>meeting take place in Riyadh.  The request to move the 
<br>meeting was relayed to Qatar by the Saudis, not the 
<br>Egyptians.  Saudi Arabia, as a big country like Egypt, has a 
<br>vested interest in keeping Egypt afloat, said HBJ.  The 
<br>Saudis agreed to host the meeting in Riyadh not because they 
<br>objected to traveling to Doha, but because the Egyptians did. 
<br> "So we argued over the meeting location" while the 
<br>Palestinians suffered, and we in Qatar "called a meeting and 
<br>said whoever comes, comes." 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (C) Qatar is worried, said HBJ, about Egypt and its 
<br>people, who are increasingly impatient.  Mubarak, continued 
<br>HBJ, says Al Jazeera is the source of Egypt's problems.  This 
<br>is an excuse.  HBJ had told Mubarak "we would stop Al Jazeera 
<br>for a year" if he agreed in that span of time to deliver a 
<br>lasting settlement for the Palestinians. 
<br>Mubarak said nothing in response, according to HBJ. 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (C) Asked his advice on bringing about an agreement 
<br>between Israel and the Palestinians, HBJ said President 
<br>Clinton recognized before leaving office that Egypt was a 
<br>problem.  When President Clinton sought help at the end of 
<br>his term in reaching a final deal, the Saudis and Egyptians 
<br>did not encourage him, said HBJ.  "They told him to do what 
<br>he thinks right."  Culturally, said HBJ, that is the way 
<br>Arabs say "you are on your own."  And President Clinton was, 
<br>said HBJ. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (C) Now we are at a stage, said HBJ, where Egypt does not 
<br>want Arab League involvement in brokering a reconciliation 
<br>agreement among the Palestinians unless the talks bog down. 
<br>HBJ said he had told Abbas that climbing down from his tree 
<br>on no settlement activity so that talks can go forward will 
<br>require Arab support.  But the Egyptians won't allow it. 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (C) Asked if tabling a more specific plan for peace 
<br>between the Israelis and Palestinians would help, HBJ said it 
<br>would be a mistake to table a plan that is too specific.  HBJ 
<br>then reiterated that the problem is more with those carrying 
<br>out the negotiations.  "The good cooks (Egypt) have not given 
<br>good food to now." 
<br> 
<br>¶22. (C) Senator Kerry noted that Special Envoy Mitchell had 
<br>made a lot of requests of Arabs but with little success. 
<br>Leaving Qatar aside, the Chairman asked HBJ for proposed next 
<br>steps.  HBJ said he trusts the Saudis, but because they talk 
<br>openly to Egypt and do not want to create more problems for 
<br>Egypt than the Egyptian government already has, it is 
<br>essential to bring in the small countries and start there. 
<br> 
<br>¶23. (C) HBJ suggested one or two GCC members, Morocco 
<br>(although the King there is hesitant) and Syria as the core 
<br>membership of an Arab League committee to address 
<br>Palestinian-Israeli concerns.  HBJ told Senator Kerry the 
<br>inclusion of Syria might surprise him, but having Syria play 
<br>a role would create jealousy among the Arabs.  Some jealously 
<br>and rivalry is just what the U.S. needs, opined HBJ, to get 
<br>the process moving. 
<br> 
<br>---------------- 
<br>IRAN AND LEBANON 
<br>---------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶24. (C) Turning to Iran, Senator Kerry said he understood 
<br>Qatar's need to find the right balance in dealing with bigger 
<br> 
<br>DOHA 00000071  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>neighbors, especially Iran given the natural gas field both 
<br>share.  Due to the working relationship Qatar maintains with 
<br>Iran, the Chairman asked HBJ for his advice as the 
<br>international community becomes more serious about economic 
<br>sanctions against Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶25. (C) HBJ said Iran's president views the U.S. as a country 
<br>that is overstretched and in difficulty as a result of too 
<br>many commitments.  Iraq, Afghanistan, and the U.S. economy 
<br>are the three main problems President Ahmadinejad sees.  HBJ 
<br>observed that a Western attack against Iran for Ahmadinejad 
<br>would be good politics, because it would allow him to take 
<br>out his opposition using the war as a pretext.  Senator Kerry 
<br>asked clarification of whether Ahmadinejad had said these 
<br>things, or if HBJ inferred them from conversation. 
<br> 
<br>¶26. (C) Qatar's PM said Ahmadinejad had told him, "We beat 
<br>the Americans in Iraq; the final battle will be in Iran." 
<br> 
<br>¶27. (C) HBJ said putting economic pressure on Iran is the 
<br>best way to get the leadership to rethink its quest for 
<br>nuclear weapons.  To be successful, he told Senator Kerry, 
<br>Russia would definitely have to be on board, as would the 
<br>Central Asian countries bordering Iran that provide food and 
<br>supplies. 
<br> 
<br>¶28. (C) Asked his perception of the state of play with the 
<br>opposition, HBJ said the U.S. had done a good job of standing 
<br>back and not becoming the symbol of the opposition.  Cracks 
<br>in the regime are appearing.  It is highly significant that 
<br>many demonstrators ignored Khamenei when he called on them to 
<br>stop their protests.  The four key pillars of Iranian power 
<br>-- the court, oil sector, imams, and Revolutionary Guards --- 
<br>all must stick with him, stressed HBJ.  There are cracks in 
<br>the system, but the downfall of the regime may not be in the 
<br>cards. 
<br> 
<br>¶29. (C) Asked what the sanctions should target, HBJ said the 
<br>money that Iran derives from oil.  Depriving Tehran of this 
<br>revenue would force the regime to negotiate. 
<br> 
<br>¶30. (C) Senator Kerry observed that Ahmadinejad was making it 
<br>easier by his actions.  There is wide consensus in the 
<br>Executive and Legislative branches of Washington to press 
<br>ahead.  Senator Kerry warned that Ahmadinejad "should not 
<br>equate Afghanistan and Iraq with what he faces." 
<br> 
<br>¶31. (C) HBJ encouraged Chairman Kerry to bear in mind that 
<br>Iran is clever and makes its opponents dizzy in the quest for 
<br>deals.  They will keep you working on a deal and then start 
<br>from scratch with a new interlocutor.  HBJ stressed that Iran 
<br>will make no deal.  Iran wants nuclear weapons, and HBJ said 
<br>he would not be surprised to see Iran test one to demonstrate 
<br>to the world its achievement. 
<br> 
<br>¶32. (C) On Lebanon, Senator Kerry asked if Iran and Hizballah 
<br>are ratcheting up their weapons stockpiles as part of Iran's 
<br>war against Israel.  HBJ affirmed that is the case. 
<br> 
<br>---- 
<br>IRAQ 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶33. (C) On Iraq, HBJ told Senator Kerry that Prime Minister 
<br>Al-Maliki wants a Shia state, even though the Sunnis (when 
<br>you count Kurds and non-Kurds) have the majority. 
<br> 
<br>¶34. (U) CODEL Kerry has cleared this message.
