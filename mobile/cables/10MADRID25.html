<br>SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR SOLOMONT'S JANUARY 12, 2010, MEETING
<br>WITH SPANISH SYG OF THE PRESIDENCY LEON
<br>
<br>REF: MADRID 20
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Alan D. Solomont, Reasons 1.4(b),(d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: The Ambassador met with Spanish SYG of the
<br>Presidency (NSA-equivalent) Bernardino Leon January 12. He
<br>wanted to meet with Leon as soon as possible to begin to
<br>establish a good working relationship and to share his
<br>observations regarding the U.S.-Spain bilateral relationship.
<br>He emphasized his primary goal as Ambassador is to
<br>strengthen the partnership between the GOS and USG. The USG
<br>wants and expects Spain to be the most reliable partner on
<br>issues of mutual interest, and the Ambassador noted its
<br>uneven behavior on critical issues such as the Balkans, its
<br>promise to take five Guantanamo detainees, and on promoting
<br>human rights in Cuba. Spain,s support and leadership in the
<br>EU on Iran and Afghanistan are opportunities for Madrid to
<br>reaffirm Spain,s commitment to the strategic partnership.
<br>The Ambassador pledged to work closely with GOS officials on
<br>obtaining Spanish public support for our mutual national
<br>security interests and counter-terrorism priorities. Leon
<br>welcomed the Ambassador's candor and commitment to forging a
<br>close working relationship, acknowledging that Spain,s
<br>credibility was at stake and it needed to follow through on
<br>its commitments. He underscored Spain,s continued
<br>aspirations to join the G-20 and welcomed the USG,s openness
<br>to this possibility. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The meeting followed a January 7 meeting in Washington
<br>between NSA Jones, Leon, and Solomont. The Ambassador
<br>delivered a message of tough love. He underscored that NSA
<br>Jones and many others in the USG thought very highly of Leon,
<br>and said his Embassy and he personally were committed to a
<br>close working relationship with Leon.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Leon briefed on plans for President Zapatero,s
<br>upcoming visit to Washington in early February for the
<br>National Prayer Breakfast. While Zapatero hopes to have a
<br>brief encounter with the President on the margins of the
<br>breakfast, he appreciates the President,s time constraints
<br>and acknowledges the recent summit meeting. Zapatero,s
<br>developing agenda in Washington includes a program at the
<br>Atlantic Council, a possible address to the U.S. Chamber of
<br>Commerce, and other meetings in which he wants to send an
<br>important message about Spain,s EU Presidency priorities and
<br>its commitment to the Transatlantic partnership. Leon said
<br>the Royal Palace accepts with pleasure the White House,s
<br>proposed February 17 date for a "substantive" visit by the
<br>King, who looks forward to establishing a close relationship
<br>with President Obama.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The Ambassador emphasized that his primary goal is to
<br>strengthen the partnership between Spain and the USG.
<br>President Obama needs the GOS to be a reliable partner on the
<br>key issues of mutual interest, he said. The USG appreciates
<br>that Spain wants to help President Obama, but the USG expects
<br>the GOS will see that cooperation with the U.S. is in Spain's
<br>interest and the interest of its NATO allies. Speaking
<br>frankly, the Ambassador indicated that Spain is viewed
<br>unevenly in the USG. While many, including NSA Jones,
<br>appreciate Spain,s contributions and support over the last
<br>year, there is concern in some quarters about Spain,s
<br>reliability, particularly on Kosovo, Cuba and elsewhere.
<br>Spain would do well to make clear commitments and then follow
<br>through.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The Ambassador emphasized that the USG welcomes Leon,
<br>FM Moratinos, and other Spanish officials, reassurances to
<br>work in tandem on key issues, and we too want to work closely
<br>with Spain to avoid misunderstandings. There are several
<br>principal opportunities for close coordination and
<br>cooperation -- on Guantanamo detainees, Afghanistan and Iran
<br>-- where Spain,s leadership, especially in the EU
<br>Presidency, is particularly welcome. He noted the importance
<br>of U/S Burns' visit to Spain January 14-15 for consultations
<br>with the Spanish and EU political directors on Iran. On
<br>Guantanamo, the Ambassador asked Leon for clarification of FM
<br>Moratinos, recent public statements suggesting Spain could
<br>not resettle detainees from Yemen, although it had committed
<br>to taking one. Leon was not aware of any GOS change of heart
<br>in this regard and undertook to clarify. He said that
<br>Spanish law enforcement is carefully vetting proposed
<br>detainees for resettlement, noting however that Spain,s very
<br>independent judiciary, and in particular its crusading
<br>investigative judges, are always poised to create problems
<br>for the government, especially on detainees. The GOS is
<br>working to get the Spanish Congress on board, and President
<br>Zapatero will appear before Congress in February to make the
<br>government's case.

<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Leon welcomed the Ambassador's invitation to
<br>coordinate closely our messages on Afghanistan, agreeing that
<br>the public needed to understand the direct link between the
<br>March 11, 2004, Atocha train bombings in Spain and
<br>Afghanistan. On Iran, Leon said Spain stands ready to
<br>support the USG and added that UNSC support will be
<br>instrumental to achieving our objectives. Leon said he had
<br>long been concerned about the proliferation effects from an
<br>unchecked Iran, noting that Iran,s actions threaten not only
<br>the Middle East but also the Maghreb on Spain,s border. On
<br>the Middle East, Leon underscored Spain,s continued interest
<br>in helping promote peace, suggesting that a meeting of the
<br>Quartet on the margins of the prospective US-EU Summit in
<br>Spain could give some impetus to the peace process. The
<br>Ambassador said Spain can help now by encouraging the
<br>Palestinians to return to the bargaining table, noting that
<br>Special Envoy Mitchell is likely to ask FM Moratinos to
<br>encourage the Palestinians in this regard during their
<br>January 12 meeting in Brussels. On Kosovo, Leon said Spain
<br>understands USG concerns and pledged to work in harmony.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Leon reported that at NSA Jones, request the GOS is
<br>outlining objectives and deliverables for a possible US-EU
<br>Summit. In closing, he mentioned that he was departing later
<br>that evening for a G-20 sherpas meeting in Mexico,
<br>reiterating Spain,s overriding national priority for G-20
<br>membership. He said he was encouraged by Deputy National
<br>Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs Froman,s
<br>openness in their recent meeting in Washington to a formula
<br>that could include Spain along with the UK, Germany, France,
<br>Italy, and the EU. Leon said he is optimistic and described
<br>Spain,s ongoing efforts to line up international support for
<br>its candidacy. While publicly none of the Europeans would
<br>pick between the Netherlands and Spain, he said that
<br>privately they agree that the Netherlands did not have a
<br>shot. While Leon did not think a definitive decision on G-20
<br>membership would be taken in Mexico, he is traveling there to
<br>make Spain,s strong case. He asked the Ambassador to call
<br>Froman to reiterate Spain,s desire for USG support.
