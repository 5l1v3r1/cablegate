<br> 
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires John M. Koenig for reasons 1.4 (b) and 
<br> (d) 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S/NF) Chancellor Merkel will be focused on a productive, 
<br>substantive meeting when you visit Baden-Baden April 3. 
<br>Germany holds the greatest untapped potential in Europe for 
<br>our transatlantic agenda; unlocking it will take sustained 
<br>effort by the Administration, and the payoff will not be 
<br>immediate.  What is most on Merkel,s mind is her political 
<br>future, six months before national elections, with her poll 
<br>numbers wobbling and her coalition increasingly 
<br>dysfunctional.  Germany,s capacity to act is constrained by 
<br>(1) the short-term demands of domestic politics (about which 
<br>we can do little), (2) the slow pace of change in public 
<br>support for a German leadership role (a focus of our 
<br>engagement), and (3) the constant demands of the economic 
<br>crisis.  Your meeting provides an opportunity to map out key 
<br>priorities with Germany for the remainder of Merkel,s 
<br>current term and beyond. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br>Merkel,s Own Crisis -- Leadership 
<br>--------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) Merkel is methodical, rational, and pragmatic -- 
<br>qualities that propelled her to stratospheric levels of 
<br>public support early in her tenure, when she presided over a 
<br>recovering economy and a successful presidency of the 
<br>European Union.  The past year has been less kind, and the 
<br>almost exactly equal split in the German electorate between 
<br>left and right is re-emerging as elections approach.  Merkel 
<br>now faces a &Gordian knot8 of rising unemployment, economic 
<br>crisis, and domestic political dissatisfaction at a time when 
<br>she can least afford a wrong move.  The effectiveness of 
<br>Merkel,s &Grand Coalition8 government is declining as her 
<br>Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Social Democratic (SPD) 
<br>partners begin in earnest their campaigns for the September 
<br>2009 election.  The Chancellor,s edge over the rival SPD, 
<br>led by Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, is 
<br>diminishing.  When cornered, Merkel can be tenacious but is 
<br>risk averse and rarely creative.  This suggests she will 
<br>remain a very circumspect Ally until the election. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (C/NF) The collapse of German exports and industrial 
<br>activity has shocked Chancellor Merkel and her advisors. 
<br>They had thought Germany would escape the worst of the world 
<br>recession thanks to its competitive position in emerging 
<br>markets.  In the New Year, Merkel and Finance Minister Peer 
<br>Steinbrueck (SPD) rushed a relatively robust stimulus program 
<br>through the Bundestag that is timed to counter a surge in 
<br>unemployment just before the September elections.  Like most 
<br>Germans, they doubt further deficit spending will generate 
<br>lasting growth, and fear too large a stimulus may cause 
<br>stagflation at home and dangerous new global imbalances. 
<br>Merkel and Steinbrueck remain bitter at the brush-off they 
<br>allegedly received during the last administration when they 
<br>advocated tighter financial oversight.  Tougher regulations, 
<br>they insist, are essential to restore confidence in the 
<br>banking system and get credit flowing again, thus creating 
<br>the pre-conditions for a sustainable recovery. 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C/NF) Hoping to escape responsibility for the economic 
<br>crisis, Merkel has issued public critiques of U.S. recovery 
<br>policy that exaggerate the differences between Washington and 
<br>continental Europe.  In fact, Germany faces many of the same 
<br>difficult choices as the U.S.  The Chancellor is expected to 
<br>put forward a further stimulus package later this year.  Her 
<br>government has bailed out big banks while holding firm on 
<br>state aid to ailing firms like Opel.  The conventional wisdom 
<br>in Germany is that Opel could be rescued with minimum state 
<br>aid if only it could be separated from GM, but in fact there 
<br>is no viable business plan for the firm to stand on its own. 
<br>The Chancellor is surrounded by bad options:  an 
<br>interventionist approach would further alienate economic 
<br>conservatives in her CDU (who are already defecting in droves 
<br>to the free-market FDP); if she does nothing, Steinmeier and 
<br>the SPD will harvest the goodwill of centrist voters for 
<br>trying to save Opel.  Merkel has not been above shifting 
<br>responsibility to the USG and General Motors, which she and 
<br> 
<br>BERLIN 00000345  002.2 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>the German media unfairly blame for bleeding Opel dry.  In 
<br>the end, Merkel,s government will likely be forced to prop 
<br>up at least parts of the automaker. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>Increasing Political Caution during Campaign 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (S/NF) Merkel and Steinmeier are pragmatists; on foreign 
<br>policy, in particular, there is more that unites them than 
<br>divides them.  But the centrifugal forces of the election 
<br>campaign and the growing mistrust between the CDU and SPD 
<br>make it increasingly difficult for them to agree on any big 
<br>ideas about Germany,s role in the world or its relations 
<br>with the United States.  Buffeted by events, Merkel is 
<br>struggling to define a convincing vision for &her8 Germany; 
<br>&competence8 is the sole component at this point.  She is 
<br>blessed that Steinmeier, her principal competitor, faces even 
<br>greater difficulties.  His party has lost its bearings in the 
<br>Grand Coalition and is plagued by internal divisions. 
<br>Steinmeier himself is a technocrat and a latecomer to 
<br>electoral politics -- his shortcomings on stage are 
<br>significant.  Steinmeier has tried to make up ground on 
<br>Merkel by publicly identifying himself with the new U.S. 
<br>Administration.  However, his ability to deliver on policy 
<br>initiatives without the Chancellor,s political support is 
<br>limited. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C/NF) Afghanistan is an example.  Merkel has been 
<br>cautious throughout her chancellorship and has doggedly 
<br>resisted real or perceived pressure for Germany to take on a 
<br>larger military role.  She and Steinmeier both have supported 
<br>the Comprehensive Approach, but the Chancellor,s CDU, in the 
<br>face of public skepticism, is reluctant even to consider 
<br>increasing police or civilian support.  Steinmeier and the 
<br>SPD have been more forward-leaning, but they cannot deliver 
<br>on their own.  You should emphasize that at the moment the 
<br>U.S. is not seeking significant additional military forces 
<br>from Germany, but that every member of the international 
<br>community will need to do much more (e.g., training security 
<br>forces and providing civilian assistance) if we are to be 
<br>successful. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>Policy Opportunities on Russia and Iran 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C/NF) Germany should play a central role with the U.S. 
<br>in defining a coordinated western Russia policy that resets 
<br>the relationship without retreating from our values.  The 
<br>winter gas crisis made Germans rethink Russia,s reliability 
<br>as a supplier, but the lack of alternatives and the 
<br>desirability of gas as a clean energy source have left the 
<br>government resigned to dependency on Russia in the 
<br>near-to-medium term.  On energy as well as Georgia, neither 
<br>Merkel nor Steinmeier has identified areas where German 
<br>policy steps could help create a more persuasive set of 
<br>incentives for Russia to integrate further into rules-based 
<br>relationships and institutions.  Meanwhile, Germany is 
<br>concerned about threats to economic and social stability in 
<br>Central and Eastern Europe, but prefers EU and IMF approaches 
<br>to limit its share of the bill. 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C/NF) Both Merkel and Steinmeier welcomed your Nowruz 
<br>address to the Iranian people and government.  They support 
<br>the U.S. investment in the diplomatic track and agree that 
<br>Germany and the EU need to invest in the economic pressure 
<br>track.  Germany,s close ties to Israel include an imperative 
<br>to defend Israel,s right to exist and to play an active role 
<br>in international non-proliferation efforts toward Iran. 
<br>Merkel will be looking to the meeting to gain a better 
<br>understanding of how you see the USG Iran policy unfolding 
<br>and what role we need Germany to play. 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (U) Mr. President, Mission Germany is honored to support 
<br>you on your first overseas trip as President, and we look 
<br>forward to welcoming you in Baden-Baden.
