<br>SUBJECT: GENERAL PETRAEUS WITH KING HAMAD: IRAQ, 
<br>AFGHANISTAN, IRAN, NATO AWACS, ENERGY 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Adam Ereli, reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Â¶1. (C) SUMMARY: In an hour-long meeting on November 1 with 
<br>CENTCOM Commander General Petraeus, Bahrain's King Hamad said 
<br>Arab states need to do more to engage Iraq, discussed 
<br>Afghanistan and the positive role India could play, urged 
<br>action to stop Iran's nuclear program, and reviewed regional 
<br>plans for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br>2.(C) IRAQ: King Hamad fully endorsed General Petraeus's 
<br>point that increased Arab engagement and influence would help 
<br>frustrate Iranian designs in Iraq. He added that the Arabs 
<br>need Egyptian and Saudi leadership in this matter and that he 
<br>had tried to make this point to the Saudi government, but 
<br>with little effect. 
<br> 
<br>3.(C) AFGHANISTAN: General Petraeus praised Bahrain's 
<br>commitment of a police company for internal security at FOB 
<br>Leatherneck. King Hamad confirmed that he would personally 
<br>see the force off at the airport on December 16. This date 
<br>will be the 10th anniversary of the King's assuming the 
<br>throne, and General Petraeus said that U.S. air assets would 
<br>be available on the 16th to transport the company to 
<br>Afghanistan. King Hamad inquired about the extent of India's 
<br>involvement in Afghanistan and noted that Bahrain saw India 
<br>as very positive force in the region. "It's a new era," he 
<br>said. "They can be of great help." 
<br> 
<br>4.(C) IRAN: King Hamad pointed to Iran as the source of much 
<br>of the trouble in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He argued 
<br>forcefully for taking action to terminate their nuclear 
<br>program, by whatever means necessary. "That program must be 
<br>stopped," he said. "The danger of letting it go on is greater 
<br>than the danger of stopping it."  King Hamad added that in 
<br>light of these regional developments, Bahrain was working to 
<br>strengthen GCC coordination and its relations with allies and 
<br>international organizations. He specifically mentioned NATO 
<br>and confirmed that Bahrain had agreed to the Alliance's 
<br>request to use Isa Airbase for AWACS missions, although the 
<br>detail on numbers and timing have yet to be discussed. 
<br> 
<br>5.(S/NF) BAHRAIN AIR SHOW AND NUCLEAR ENERGY: King Hamad 
<br>asked General Petraeus for his help in encouraging U.S. 
<br>aircraft manufacturers to participate in the inaugural 
<br>Bahrain Air Show, scheduled for January 2010. He said that 
<br>France was pushing the Rafale and would be there in force, 
<br>although he agreed with Petraeus that the French fighter was 
<br>yesterday's technology. Warming to the subject of French 
<br>commercial diplomacy and referring to President Sarkozy, King 
<br>Hamad said, "The UAE will give him a hard time soon," over 
<br>France's proposed deal for nuclear reactors. "They're not 
<br>happy with the project he's offered them." King Hamad also 
<br>mentioned that Bahrain was studying options for using nuclear 
<br>power to generate electricity. He said he had asked the 
<br>Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Interior and Public Works to 
<br>present him recommendations and invited the Ambassador to 
<br>discuss with them possible U.S. involvement. Post will do so.
