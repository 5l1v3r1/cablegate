<br>SUBJECT: SPANISH DEFENSE MINISTER TELEPHONES CHARGE ON
<br>VENEZUELA SALE
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Charge d'Affaires J. Robert Manzanares,
<br>reasons 1.4(b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Minister of Defense Jose Bono telephoned Charge
<br>February 22 to explain Spain's decision to sell military and
<br>civilian ships to Venezuela. Saying he wished to follow up
<br>with Charge after Bono's appearance before Congress's defense
<br>commission a day earlier (during which the Defense Minister
<br>answered questions about the Venezuela sale and Spain's
<br>Afghanistan deployment), Bono explained that Spain would
<br>likely sell a petroleum-carrying vessel, a ship that
<br>transports asphalt and five "patrol boats" to the Chavez
<br>government. He emphasized the Spanish government has
<br>received "assurances" from Caracas that the patrol ships will
<br>not be used for offensive purposes, but would be used to
<br>protect Venezuela's maritime borders and Exclusive Economic
<br>Zone. (Note: Other sources have told us the ships are
<br>actually corvettes capable of being armed with naval guns and
<br>missiles. A press report indicated the vessels would be
<br>similar to Spain's "Descubierta" class corevettes with a
<br>displacement of 1,500-1,800 tons. End note.) The principal
<br>reason Spain was making the sale to Venezuela -- reportedly
<br>worth over 600 million euros (USD 780 million) -- was to give
<br>a shot in the arm to ailing state-owned ship building firm
<br>Izar. The sale would be "very significant for Izar," said
<br>Bono, but would not tip the military balance in the region.
<br>He also told Charge that the Zapatero government had
<br>conferred with the Uribe government and the Colombians "did
<br>not see major problems" with the sale.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Comment: Bono likewise telephoned Charge from
<br>Caracas when he made his unannounced "discreet" trip there in
<br>late January to assure us he was not doing anything untoward.
<br>His latest call is another indication that the GOS and Bono
<br>in particular well understand U.S. concerns about Spain's
<br>developing relations with the Chavez government. Despite
<br>that, Izar's economic woes are front and center, driving
<br>Spain's intense interest in selling ships to Venezuela. U.S.
<br>concerns aside, Spain will likely move forward to take
<br>advantage of an opportunity to tamp down labor unrest at the
<br>state-owned company.
