<br>SUBJECT: IRAN: BROTHER OF IRGC'S SAFAVI SAYS A U.S. TERROR
<br>DESIGNATION OF IRGC WILL PRECLUDE IRAQ SECURITY COOPERATION
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Maura Connelly for reasons
<br>1.4 (B) and (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. xxxxxxxxxxxx Iran
<br>Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) xxxxxxxxxxxx told London Iran Watcher
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>that Iran's cooperation on security in Iraq, though not yet
<br>evident, would be forthcoming, but in the same breath argued
<br>that a U.S. terrorist designation of the IRGC would prevent
<br>any such cooperation. xxxxxxxxxxxx for the USG to hold its
<br>hand on designation came xxxxxxxxxxxx engaged with the invited group at length
<br>on Tehran's view of U.S.-Iran relations, Iraqi security, and
<br>the nuclear issue. xxxxxxxxxxxx candid remarks, which included
<br>extremely vigorous exchanges with xxxxxxxxxxxx alternated between aggressive
<br>characterizations of Iran's relations in the Persian Gulf,
<br>admissions of the IRGC's presence and role in Iraq and
<br>Afghanistan, and apparently earnest statements of Iran's
<br>desire for cooperation with the United States. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>appeared to pay close attention to xxxxxxxxxxxx message on need
<br>for Iran's behavior in Iraq to match its stated support for
<br>Iraqi stability and for Iran to weigh the benefits of the
<br>E3 3 incentives package and "suspension for suspension" offer
<br>which remains on the table. End Summary.
<br>
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx Private Plea on IRGC Designation
<br>------------------------------------------
<br>¶2. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx made his private plea on not designating the
<br>IRGC under U.S. law after a three-hour long larger group
<br>discussion during which xxxxxxxxxxxx had stressed that attacks on
<br>U.S. forces in Iraq by militias using Iranian-provided
<br>ordnance had actually increased from May to July, despite
<br>Iran's claim to support Iraqi stability. xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that
<br>the USG would soon see (he was vague on how soon) evidence of
<br>Iranian security cooperation in the form of diminished
<br>attacks, taking the July discussions in Baghdad -- as opposed
<br>to those held in May -- as the point at which the IRGC had
<br>decided it could go forward with such cooperation. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>described how IRGC orders to "our allies" are "in the
<br>pipeline," but it takes time for such orders to be
<br>disseminated throughout Iraqi militia networks and acted upon
<br>("it is a very large machine, with delayed effect").
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) By way of illustration of this delayed implementation
<br>phenomenon, xxxxxxxxxxxx said there had been an unintended attack
<br>"by our (Shiite Iraqi) allies" on UK forces immediately after
<br>the release of the UK naval hostages last April. xxxxxxxxxxxx said
<br>the IRGC had indeed issued an order for attacks on UK forces,
<br>in response to what he called an earlier UK attack on the
<br>Iranian consulate in Basra, but that Iranian expression of
<br>unhappiness had been satisfied with the hostage episode, and
<br>that IRGC authorities were consequently exasperated by the
<br>militia attack occuring shortly after the hostage resolution.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx said their Iraqi "allies" explained the incident as
<br>the result of a standing "general order" to launch such
<br>attacks, which had not yet been rescinded. xxxxxxxxxxxx indicated
<br>that similar organizational snafus lie behind the current
<br>continuing attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx went on to argue, however, that a USG
<br>designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization would
<br>effectively end all interest, or political ability, of the
<br>IRGC to cooperate with the USG on Iraqi or Afghan security.
<br>He stressed that, unlike "a few years ago, under Khatami,"
<br>
<br>London 00003175 002 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>the IRGC plays a central and preeminent role in the Iranian
<br>government and that, if the IRGC is designated as a terrorist
<br>organization, the USG will have no Iranian partner with which
<br>to engage on security or other issues of mutual concern.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx said it makes no difference to Iran whether the
<br>proposed IRGC designation is done under U.S. domestic law or
<br>international authority -- all sanctions, financial measures
<br>and designations are seen by Iranian authorities and the
<br>public as authored by America, with international partners
<br>such as the E3 plus 3 and the UN as mere cutouts for U.S.
<br>initiatives. The practical effects of such measures are
<br>unimportant to the Iranian Government, but the symbolic and
<br>psychological consequences do matter.
<br>
<br>Group Discussion Highlights
<br>---------------------------
<br>¶5. (C) The evening's larger group discussion had several
<br>highlights:
<br>
<br>-- A (surprising) degree of self-professed confusion by
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx at the what he called the "multiple and conflicting
<br>signals" on Iran policy from various parts of the USG
<br>including the Congress;
<br>
<br>-- An open acknowledgment by xxxxxxxxxxxx that the IRGC is present
<br>and operating in both Afghanistan and Iraq (with U.S.
<br>occupation and Sunni attacks on Shias given as a
<br>justification);
<br>
<br>-- xxxxxxxxxxxx description of Shiite militias in Iraq as "our
<br>allies, whom we created against Saddam;"
<br>
<br>-- Fiery statements by xxxxxxxxxxxx on U.S. injustices perpetrated
<br>over the years against Iran, on Iran's resolve and
<br>capabilities to launch military and asymmetric responses, and
<br>on how Iran should replace or join with the United States as
<br>the Gulf region's "co-manager," all of which provoked
<br>vehement rejoinders from xxxxxxxxxxxx;
<br>
<br>-- xxxxxxxxxxxx reflections on a more mature Iran's
<br>no-longer-revolutionary approach to its foreign relations;
<br>
<br>-- xxxxxxxxxxxx repeated return to the theme of desiring a
<br>constructive and cooperative relationship with the U.S.,
<br>first on Afghanistan and Iraq and secondly on the nuclear
<br>issue;
<br>
<br>-- xxxxxxxxxxxx near-gloating remarks on Hezbollah's 2006
<br>conflict with Israel; and
<br>
<br>-- xxxxxxxxxxxx description of the United States as having become
<br>Iran's "hostage" in Iraq ("you cannot stay and you cannot
<br>leave ... your forces there and in the region are our
<br>target").
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>¶6. (C) Although impeccably turned out, outwardly genial, and
<br>speaking with confidence and an evident sense of authority,
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx appeared to be under significant stress and at great
<br>pains to listen carefully and closely to all interlocutors,
<br>and especially to xxxxxxxxxxxx (standard) comments on the E3 plus
<br>3 offer, as well as the need for Iranian behavior change in
<br>Iraq. xxxxxxxxxxxx apparently genuine desire to engage and move
<br>towards cooperation was coupled to his equally apparent sense
<br>that Iran is entitled to use violent means against us until
<br>
<br>London 00003175 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>such time as there a change in the USG's "regional behavior."
