<br>4 (B) and (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary. In a surprise announcement April 7,
<br>President Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero named new Defense,
<br>Interior and Education Ministers. Jose Bono is out as
<br>Defense Minister, to be replaced by Jose Antonio Alonso who
<br>moves over from his post as Interior Minister. Current
<br>Socialist spokesman in Parliament and member of Zapatero's
<br>inner circle, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, will take over the
<br>Interior Ministry and Mercedes Cabrera Calvo-Sotelo will
<br>replace Maria Jesus San Segundo as Minster of Education. The
<br>cabinet changes are the first since Zapatero and the
<br>Socialist Party (PSOE) took office following the March 2004
<br>elections. The Ambassador called Bono and Alonso to thank
<br>them for their work with the U.S. Bono expressed his
<br>admiration for the U.S. and said he was uncertain what he
<br>would be doing next. Alonso said that had a good
<br>relationship with U.S. officials as Minister of Interior and
<br>was used to cooperating with the USG. Alonso also said the
<br>U.S. should expect "no negative surprises" from him as
<br>Minister of Defense and suggested that he and the Ambassador
<br>meet immediately after the Easter holidays for a
<br>comprehensive review of U.S.-Spain defense issues. The
<br>Ambassador was unable to reach Rubalcaba, but will speak with
<br>him as soon as possible to offer continued close
<br>counterterrorism communication. End Summary.
<br>
<br>//THE ETA FACTOR//
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Embassy's initial analysis on the Interior and Defense
<br>Ministry changes is that Zapatero's ETA policy is the driving
<br>force, although there is some speculation that Bono himself
<br>asked to leave and this is a shuffle forced on Zapatero.
<br>Whatever the cause, Zapatero has put into place key allies as
<br>he pursues his strategy with ETA following the March 26
<br>announcement of a ceasefire. Rubalcaba has been the brain
<br>trust on the ETA policy and putting him in place as Interior
<br>Minister solidifies his role and gives him the authority to
<br>devise and implement Zapatero's policies on ETA, while
<br>ensuring political control over police actions against ETA.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Moving Alonso to Defense removes Bono -- a longtime
<br>rival of Zapatero. Bono has not been seen as favorable
<br>towards Zapatero's policies favoring increased powers for
<br>Spain's regions. This puts Alonso -- a close personal friend
<br>of Zapatero -- into a key position as Zapatero consolidates
<br>his political support and moves his ETA strategy forward.
<br>Zapatero's popularity has increased considerably and he
<br>likely feels he no longer needs to keep Bono close to him.
<br>However, free from the restraint that comes in being in
<br>government, Bono may be a wildcard for Zapatero on the
<br>political scene.
<br>
<br>//CHANGES AT MOD//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The change at the MOD is important for the US, given
<br>the extent of our Defense relationship with the GOS. While
<br>not necessarily in any "pro-US" camp, Alonso has been
<br>favorable to cooperation with the US on counter-terrorism.
<br>He has visited the US in his role as Interior Minister and
<br>has met with Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and FBI
<br>Director Robert Mueller -- both in Spain and in the US. The
<br>Ambassador has a cordial relationship with Alonso and the
<br>Embassy works well with his staff. These relationships could
<br>be helpful as Alonso assumes his new role at Defense.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Moving Alonso to Defense will likely mean there will
<br>be other changes in the ministry as well, although it may
<br>take until June to see all the changes that could take place.
<br>A PSOE official in the Ministry told the Embassy that the
<br>military leadership is unlikely to be affected by the change.
<br>However, Alonso has been interested for quite some time in
<br>removing Civil Guard Director General Gomez Arruche, so
<br>Arruche's days may be numbered. Other sources tell us that
<br>Alberto Saiz, the head of the Spanish Intelligence Service
<br>(the CNI, which falls under the MOD) might be replaced, as he
<br>was directly appointed by Bono and was considered a strong
<br>Bono ally.

<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Sources also said Bono has been "feeling
<br>uncomfortable" in the Defense Ministry for "a long time."
<br>Spanish media is reporting that Bono might be done with
<br>politics for good, but post thinks that unlikely. With Bono
<br>out of the picture, a PSOE advisor told the Embassy that the
<br>"Moratinos line on foreign policy has obtained a victory."
<br>Though Bono has portrayed himself and is widely seen as a
<br>"friend" of the US, his actions on Venezuela defense sales,
<br>the Spanish troop withdrawal from Iraq and other issues
<br>sometimes belie this image.
<br>
<br>//CHANGES AT MOI//
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) A Partido Popular (PP) advisor told the Embassy that
<br>Rubalcaba is unlikely to make many changes at Interior
<br>because many of "his people" are already in place. MFA
<br>Director General for North America and Europe, Jose Pons,
<br>told the DCM that one or two key Interior officials (such as
<br>Antonio Camacho, currently serving as Alonso's deptuty) may
<br>be headed to Defense with Alonso. Rubalcaba is not known as
<br>a friend of the US; however, he may well see it in his
<br>interest to continue the CT cooperation with the US that was
<br>put in place by his predecessor. Rubalcaba is seen as smart
<br>and experienced and has the skills necessary to influence
<br>people. Tapping him for Minster of Interior is proof
<br>positive that Zapatero is serious about succeeding with ETA.
<br>
<br>//PP REACTION//
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy wasted little time
<br>in criticizing the selection of Rubalcaba as Interior
<br>Minister (stating bluntly that the PP "does not trust
<br>Rubalcaba") and lamenting Bono's departure. Rajoy's comments
<br>on Rubalcaba reflect Rubalcaba's reputation as a skilled, and
<br>highly partisan, political actor who has worked hard to
<br>outmaneuver and isolate the PP. Bono, on the other hand, is
<br>among the most conservative PSOE leaders so it is
<br>understandable that the PP would be sad to see him go. He
<br>agreed with the PP in opposing greater autonomy to the
<br>Catalan or Basque regions and was seen by the PP as a brake
<br>on Zapatero's readiness to deal with the regional
<br>governments. Interestingly, a PP think tank speculated that
<br>Alonso was moved to the MOD in part because Alonso had
<br>developed good relations with U.S. counterparts during his
<br>stint as Interior Minister. The think tank contrasted Bono's
<br>"strident positions within Spain and abroad" with Alonso's
<br>ability to inspire confidence both within Spain and with the
<br>USG.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Comment: Zapatero has installed two of his closest
<br>allies into key positions in his cabinet. Neither one runs
<br>the risk of being seen as a political competitor of Zapatero
<br>-- one of the problems that contributed to Bono's departure.
<br>Both Alonso and Rubalcaba will carry out Zapatero's strategy
<br>with ETA to the letter -- a strategy that is no doubt
<br>directed at winning the next national elections with an
<br>absolute majority. Political observers were impressed that
<br>Zapatero organized the cabinet reshuffle in complete secrecy.
<br>Clearly, Zapatero is using this cabinet shuffle, whatever
<br>the cause, to move swiftly to take advantage of recent
<br>victories and has consolidated his control over his
<br>government and the Socialist Party.
