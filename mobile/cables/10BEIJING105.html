<br>
<br>REF: A. BEIJING 104 
<br>¶B. BEIJING 86 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Economic Minister Counselor Weinstein for reasons: 1.4(B 
<br>), (D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. Google's Beijing headquarters continued 
<br>business "as usual" today as it still provided the 
<br>China-based version of its search engine. Google emphasized 
<br>its filtering of that search engine remained "unchanged" and 
<br>"compliant with Chinese law." Google has not yet engaged the 
<br>Chinese government in discussions about continuing its 
<br>operations here. The Chinese Government provided the first 
<br>official reaction to Google's January 14 announcement, with 
<br>the MFA spokesperson and other PRC officials rejecting 
<br>allegations of Chinese responsibility for the recent, alleged 
<br>cyber attacks on Google and other companies' internet 
<br>architecture. Local industry experts and American 
<br>businesspersons here almost unanimously expect Google will 
<br>withdraw from the market, despite its claims to still be open 
<br>to resolving its problems with China. Local media coverage 
<br>included numerous business articles on Google's travails, 
<br>with at least one Chinese website claiming to have conducted 
<br>an opinion poll showing a large majority support China not 
<br>making concessions to Google. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Google China's Beijing HQ remained relatively quiet 
<br>January 14, with Google employees continuing to work. 
<br>Spectators, press, and well-wishers continued to visit, 
<br>according to XXXXXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> explained Google has still not  engaged with PRC authorities
<br>to reach a solution to the  current impasse, but noted China's
<br>State Council Information  Office (SCIO) did contact Google
<br>China's government relations  staff January 13 following a
<br>several-hour suspension of  Google.cn's search filtering
<br>mechanisms, which XXXXXXXXXXXX explained 
<br>were due to technical issues. XXXXXXXXXXXX explained
<br>that SCIO asked  Google's government relations team if this was
<br>a deliberate  modification of its filtering. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> said Google had not disabled its filters, and SCIO accepted
<br>Google's explanation.  At present, according to a U.S.-based Google
<br>representative,  Google "continues to comply with the law in
<br>China and is  filtering Google.cn as (it) has been." The U.S.-based
<br>rep  did concede that Google's filter is undergoing changes, but 
<br>publicly Google is not "explaining the changing nature of 
<br>(its) filter" and maintains the filtering remains in 
<br>compliance with Chinese law. 
<br>
<br>GOVERNMENT REACTION COOL 
<br>------------------------ 
<br>¶3. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX reports that the PRC still has not 
<br>directly addressed the firm's announcement with Google. 
<br>However, MFA spokesperson Jiang Yu addressed the Google 
<br>matter in a regular January 14 MFA press briefing (reported 
<br>Ref A), during which reporters barraged her with questions on 
<br>Google. Jiang stated the Chinese government has made its 
<br>position clear to the U.S. and asserted Chinese law 
<br>prohibited cyber attacks, including hacking. Jiang also said 
<br>China's internet is "open and the Chinese government 
<br>encourages its development." State Council Information 
<br>Office (SCIO) Minister Wang posted a web statement January 
<br>13, which, while not directly addressing Google, stressed 
<br>that the internet should be used to shape public opinion and 
<br>should comply with state control. Yao Jian, Spokesperson for 
<br>the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on January 13 said only 
<br>that MOFCOM would follow the Google matter closely. A MOFCOM 
<br>specialist on multinational investment policies was quoted in 
<br>the press as arguing that the Google case is unique and 
<br>should not be seen as relevant to other multinational 
<br>investments in China. Officials at the Ministry of Industry 
<br>and Information Technology (MIIT) declined to comment on the 
<br>case, claiming that they do not have enough information. 
<br>
<br>SPECULATION ON NEXT STEPS 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>¶4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX spoke January 13 with
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, who opined that the Chinese
<br>government was likely surprised  by Google's
<br>announcement of its potential withdrawal, and the 
<br>PRC would be unlikely to seek out talks with Google. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX anticipates we will see a slow,
<br>perfunctory attempt to engage  between U.S.-based Google
<br>representatives and the Chinese,  but that, in
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX opinion  the PRC has already
<br>likely decided 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00000105 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>that Google is a company that "does not understand how to 
<br>work with China." Only if Google continues to accept China's 
<br>mandates would an accommodation be possible, according to
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX. XXXXXXXXXXXX also predicted that,
<br>failing an agreement, the Gmail  accounts of Chinese users would
<br>suffer sporadic interruptions  of access, and the potential for a
<br>complete blockage of  Google.com is also not out of the question. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) A highly-regarded long-term local industry analyst
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, also saw Google's actions as  leading
<br>quickly to its withdrawal from the Chinese market. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX speculated to Econoff that Google may
<br>have an extremely limited window to seek a solution, given
<br>the increasing  "maniacal" posture of elements of the Chinese
<br>bureaucracy  with respect to information control and discriminatory 
<br>policies and practices toward foreign elements. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> also  opined that Google's withdrawal from the market would 
<br>undermine competition here and therefore innovation in 
<br>China's internet industry. He saw Baidu's success as a 
<br>direct result of competition with Google and other western 
<br>companies; without that competition, Baidu and other Chinese 
<br>companies would likely lose their competitive edge in the 
<br>long run. Separately, XXXXXXXXXXXX was quoted in the
<br>media as  saying "there has been this received wisdom tha
<br> no one can  afford not to be in China, but that is being
<br>questioned now." 
<br>
<br>BUSINESS COMMUNITY REACTIONS 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) XXXXXXXXXXXX told XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> January 14 that logistics  had made it impossible for its Board to
<br>clear and release a press statement January 13 XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>The Committee has drafted a statement on the security and 
<br>free flow of information that it now hopes to clear and 
<br>release within twenty-four hours. XXXXXXXXXXXX noted
<br>that  in seeking to remove all filters from its China-based search 
<br>engine, Google has firmly positioned itself publicly and will 
<br>not be able to back down. XXXXXXXXXXXX believes
<br>Google's China  exit is imminent, and would only at the
<br>margins affect  information flows, IT services, and the
<br>development of  competition in China. He did hope that
<br>this matter would  force the PRC to use greater caution
<br>before implementing  policies harmful to the business climate. 
<br>
<br>¶8. XXXXXXXXXXXX thought Google,  however, had backe
<br> itself into a corner from which it could  not likely exit, given
<br>the Chinese reputation for  non-compromise in such matters. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Jack Ma, Chairman of Chinese internet giant Alibaba 
<br>(with ownership links to Yahoo China, which has faced its own 
<br>difficulties in China) struck an exhortatory chord in media 
<br>interviews: "Giving up is the biggest failure. Nothing is 
<br>easy. It is admirable if one can still do well no matter how 
<br>many difficulties are on the way."
