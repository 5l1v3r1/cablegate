<br>SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR FBI DIRECTOR MUELLER'S FEBRUARY 24 
<br>VISIT 
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM Gerald M. Feierstein, Reasons 1.4 (b)/(d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Embassy Islamabad warmly welcomes your 
<br>February 24 visit to Pakistan. You will participate in a 
<br>trilateral cooperation meeting with Pakistani Interior 
<br>Minister Rehman Malik and Afghan Interior Minister Hanif 
<br>Atmar, followed by bilateral meetings with senior Pakistani 
<br>officials, including Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) 
<br>Director General Zafarullah Khan, Intelligence Bureau (IB) 
<br>Director General Javed Noor, and Inter-Services Intelligence 
<br>(ISI) Director General Ahmed Shuja Pasha. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) You should express to your Pakistani interlocutors 
<br>appreciation for ongoing law enforcement cooperation and 
<br>express our readiness to enhance such efforts. You may want 
<br>to register U.S. concerns about terrorist threats to U.S. 
<br>citizens and U.S. interests that emanate from Pakistan, and 
<br>encourage continued Pakistani action to counter these 
<br>threats. You should press the Pakistanis to follow through 
<br>on their prosecution of the seven Mumbai defendants. End 
<br>Summary. 
<br>
<br>Domestic Overview 
<br>------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Pakistan continues to face extraordinary challenges on 
<br>the security and law enforcement front. The country has 
<br>suffered greater military, law enforcement, and civilian 
<br>casualties in fighting extremism and terrorism than almost 
<br>any other country. Pakistan's military is currently engaged 
<br>in combat operations against militant groups in the Malakand 
<br>Division of North West Frontier Province (NFWP) and six of 
<br>the seven agencies of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas 
<br>(FATA) along the Pak-Afghan border. At the same time, 
<br>Pakistan has experienced an alarming increase in terrorist 
<br>attacks against government and civilian targets in Pakistan's 
<br>major cities, resulting in several hundred deaths in recent 
<br>months. In your meetings, you should acknowledge the 
<br>sacrifices made by Pakistan's law enforcement agencies and 
<br>the pressure the terrorist attacks have placed on their 
<br>resources. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In the midst of this difficult security situation, 
<br>Pakistan's civilian government remains weak, ineffectual, and 
<br>corrupt. Domestic politics is dominated by uncertainty about 
<br>the fate of President Zardari. He enjoys approval ratings in 
<br>the 20 percent range and has repeatedly clashed with key 
<br>power centers, including the military, politically ambitious 
<br>Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, and opposition 
<br>leader Nawaz Sharif. In December, the Supreme Court ruled 
<br>unconstitutional the November 2007 National Reconciliation 
<br>Ordinance, promulgated by then-President Musharraf, which 
<br>provided legal amnesty for Benazir Bhutto, Zardari, and key 
<br>figures in their party, enabling them to participate in 2008 
<br>elections. The Court's ruling has paved the way for a 
<br>revival of corruption cases against a number of officials, 
<br>including Interior Minister Rehman Malik. Whether corruption 
<br>cases can be revived against Zardari himself is less certain, 
<br>as Pakistan's constitution includes a clause providing 
<br>sitting presidents with criminal immunity. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) While we have had major successes in our military and 
<br>law enforcement cooperation with Pakistan, cooperation has 
<br>frequently been hampered by suspicion in Pakistan's military 
<br>and intelligence establishment about U.S. intentions and 
<br>objectives. Among other things, the Pakistanis believe that 
<br>we have favored India over Pakistan -- most notably, by 
<br>approving civil-nuclear cooperation with India -- and that we 
<br>aim to dismantle Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, which, 
<br>in light of their conventional military disadvantage 
<br>vis-a-vis India, they consider critical to their national 
<br>security. The military and intelligence establishment is 
<br>also concerned that we are working with Pakistan's civilian 
<br>leadership to limit the military's prerogative in determining 
<br>Pakistan's national security policies. As a result of these 
<br>concerns, the military and intelligence establishment has 
<br>taken steps since Spring 2009 to hamper the operations of the 
<br>
<br>ISLAMABAD 00000416 002 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>Embassy. These steps include holding up the issuance and 
<br>renewal of Pakistani visas for permanent Embassy staff and 
<br>TDYers; denying import permits for armored vehicles for 
<br>Embassy use; sabotaging our contract with DynCorp 
<br>International to provide enhanced protective support for 
<br>Consulate General Peshawar personnel; slowing down 
<br>importation of U.S. assistance for the Pakistani government, 
<br>including equipment for Pakistani law enforcement agencies; 
<br>shutting down our Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) training 
<br>program at Pakistan's Sihala Police Academy; putting up 
<br>roadblocks for our acquiring additional land for the 
<br>Embassy's expansion; and harassing Embassy personnel by 
<br>stopping and detaining Embassy vehicles. Some of these 
<br>problems have recently abated in response to our repeatedly 
<br>raising them with the highest levels of the Pakistani 
<br>government. However, we expect we will have to continue to 
<br>push back against such impediments for the foreseeable future. 
<br>
<br>Federal Investigation Agency 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The FBI's primary Pakistani counterpart is the Federal 
<br>Investigation Agency (FIA). On December 7, the government 
<br>replaced FIA Director General Tariq Khosa with Zafarullah 
<br>Khan. While Khosa was ostensibly given a promotion by being 
<br>named Secretary of the Ministry of Narcotics Control, a 
<br>number of press reports maintained that Khosa was removed 
<br>from his FIA position for his aggressive pursuit of 
<br>corruption cases against government officials and 
<br>businessmen. Khosa had developed close cooperation with the 
<br>U.S. on a host of law enforcement issues, including on the 
<br>Mumbai case. While Khan has a strong law enforcement 
<br>background, he has not shown an inclination to be as 
<br>forward-leaning on cooperation as Khosa was. 
<br>
<br>Counter-Terrorism Finance 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) In the past year, Pakistan has made steady progress in 
<br>combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. 
<br>Earlier this year, the FIA partnered with the State Bank of 
<br>Pakistan to crack down on large licensed and unlicensed money 
<br>service businesses that were violating foreign exchange laws 
<br>and contributing to money laundering. In January, the 
<br>National Assembly passed new Anti-Money Laundering (AML) 
<br>legislation; the bill is currently awaiting Senate action. 
<br>In the interim, the legislation is in force through its 
<br>promulgation as an ordnance signed by President Zardari. 
<br>Separately, during a February 12 meeting in Islamabad, 
<br>Assistant Treasury Secretary David Cohen provided the 
<br>Pakistanis with a compilation of tearline information on the 
<br>financial activities of terrorist organizations in Pakistan 
<br>-- including their use of the formal financial sector -- and 
<br>affiliated charities, businesses, and individuals. Cohen 
<br>encouraged the Pakistanis to exploit these leads in the 
<br>pursuit of additional inform 
<br>ation to identify key terrorism donors, fundraisers, and 
<br>financial facilitators. Cohen also passed declassified 
<br>terrorism finance information to four Pakistani banks. 
<br>
<br>Law Enforcement Assistance 
<br>-------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Pakistan's terrorism threats necessitate substantial 
<br>strengthening of the country's law enforcement capabilities. 
<br>The State Department's International Narcotics and Law 
<br>Enforcement (INL) Bureau is providing significant training, 
<br>equipment, and infrastructure assistance to the police in 
<br>North West Frontier Province (NWFP), i.e., the province most 
<br>affected by terrorist attacks. This assistance -- $40.5 
<br>million in FY2009 and $34.6 million in FY2010 -- focuses on 
<br>the NWFP police's Elite Force, a "heavy" police force with 
<br>SWAT-like capabilities established in 2008. Equipment we 
<br>are providing the Elite Force includes vehicles, armored 
<br>personnel carriers, protective vests, night vision goggles, 
<br>and communications gear. We are hardening police checkpoints 
<br>with Hesco-like barriers and are rebuilding three police 
<br>
<br>ISLAMABAD 00000416 003 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>stations in NWFP's Malakand Division that were destroyed by 
<br>militants. INL is also funding a variety of police training 
<br>courses implemented by the Department of Justice's ICITAP 
<br>program that are open to nationwide participation. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) The Department of State's Anti-Terrorism Assistance 
<br>(ATA) program has separate activities aimed at enhancing the 
<br>counter-terrorism capabilities of Pakistan's law enforcement 
<br>agencies. A key component of the ATA program is focused on 
<br>"hard skills" tactical training, including explosives 
<br>detection and disposal, quick reaction, and VIP protection. 
<br>Unfortunately, the ATA program is now under threat of 
<br>termination. Following false press reports that our ATA 
<br>trainers are using the training center provided by the 
<br>Pakistani government, i.e., the Sihala Police Academy, for 
<br>nefarious purposes -- including to gather information on a 
<br>nearby Pakistan nuclear installation -- the government has 
<br>decided to end our use of that facility and has not yet 
<br>provided an acceptable alternative site. 
<br>
<br>Mumbai Case 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Pakistan's prosecution of the seven suspects it 
<br>arrested in the Mumbai case -- i.e., Lashkar-e-Tayiba (LeT) 
<br>operatives Zakiur Rehman Lahkvi, Zarrar Shah, Al-Qama, Shahid 
<br>Jamil Riaz, and Hammad Amin Saqid, and terrorism financiers 
<br>Jamil Ahmed and Younos Anjum -- is proceeding, though at a 
<br>slow pace. The defense lawyers have aggressively filed 
<br>motions challenging varying aspects of the case. On November 
<br>25, an Anti-Terrorism Court finally framed the charges 
<br>against the seven defendants, allowing the court proceedings, 
<br>which are being held in camera, to move to the trial phase. 
<br>Four FBI expert witnesses are expected to be called to 
<br>testify for the prosecution. The government has continually 
<br>reassured us that the prosecutors will win convictions 
<br>against all the defendants after a trial lasting several 
<br>months, though it has a stronger case against the five LeT 
<br>operatives than against the two terrorism financers. There 
<br>are concerns that some of the convictions could be overturned 
<br>at the appellate level, where the courts set an extremely 
<br>high evidentiary bar. On October 12, a Pakistani court 
<br>quashed all remaining cases against Hafiz Saeed, the head of 
<br>LeT alias Jama'at-ud-Dawa (JuD). Those cases were not 
<br>related to the Mumbai attack. The government has repeatedly 
<br>told us that it would need much more evidence of Saeed's 
<br>direct involvement in the Mumbai attacks to move forward with 
<br>Mumbai-related charges against him. 
<br>
<br>David Coleman Headley 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) In December, an FBI-DOJ team briefed Pakistani 
<br>officials from the ISI, Ministry of Interior, FIA, IB, and 
<br>MFA on the David Coleman Headley investigation, providing 
<br>them with tear-line information on Headley's statements to 
<br>U.S. authorities. ISI officials said they had very little 
<br>information to identify the Pakistanis mentioned in the 
<br>statements. They discussed their investigation into First 
<br>World Immigration Service, a business front used by Headley 
<br>and his co-conspirators. The ISI said while they would not 
<br>grant direct FBI access to co-conspirator Major (retd.) 
<br>Abdurrehman Syed, who was in ISI custody, the FBI could 
<br>submit questions for Syed through the ISI. The FIA and 
<br>Ministry of Interior informed the FBI that it would be 
<br>difficult to introduce Headley-related evidence in the 
<br>government's prosecution of the Mumbai defendants, including 
<br>because Headley's statements to U.S. authorities would be 
<br>treated as hearsay with little evidentiary value in court. 
<br>
<br>Sargodha Five 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The Pakistanis continue to pursue their own case 
<br>against the five American citizens from Northern Virginia who 
<br>were arrested in Sargodha, Punjab province, on December 8, 
<br>following suspicions they had travelled to Pakistan to engage 
<br>
<br>ISLAMABAD 00000416 004 OF 004 
<br>
<br>
<br>in jihadist activities. They have not acted on our request 
<br>that the five be returned to the United States. The 
<br>Pakistani prosecutor has repeatedly asked for continuations 
<br>in the case because he is not yet prepared to move forward 
<br>with charges. The five suspects, who claim to have been 
<br>abused while in custody, were denied bail at a February 16 
<br>court hearing. The next hearing will take place sometime in 
<br>March. 
<br>
<br>Aafia Siddiqui 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) There has been widespread condemnation here of the 
<br>February 3 guilty verdict against Dr. Aafia Siddiqui, a 
<br>Pakistani citizen who was tried in Federal Court in New York 
<br>on charges of attempting to murder U.S. soldiers and law 
<br>enforcement authorities in Afghanistan. Many Pakistanis were 
<br>taken by surprise by the verdict because one-sided Pakistani 
<br>media coverage of the case reported only on her defense and 
<br>not the prosecution's case, leading local observers to 
<br>conclude her acquittal was a near certainty. We have 
<br>stressed to the Pakistanis that Siddiqui received a fair 
<br>trial and has a right to an appeal. A number of our 
<br>Pakistani interlocutors have suggested that President Obama 
<br>consider pardoning Siddiqui, and Prime Minister Gilani told 
<br>Senator Kerry on February 16 that Siddiqui should be 
<br>transferred to Pakistan to serve out her sentence here.
