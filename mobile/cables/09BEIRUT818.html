<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Michele J. Sison for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>-------- 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Caretaker Prime Minister Fouad Siniora told visiting 
<br>Commander General of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) General 
<br>David Petraeus and the Ambassador June 30 that he was "quite 
<br>satisfied" with the outcome of Lebanon's June 7 parliamentary 
<br>elections.  Siniora said that the Lebanese had voted for the 
<br>state and its institutions and confirmed that Lebanon could 
<br>practice its democracy without outside interference -- if 
<br>given the opportunity.  He also thanked the United States for 
<br>sustained military assistance.  General Petraeus 
<br>congratulated Lebanon on the peaceful conduct of the 
<br>elections and expressed hope that a cabinet would be formed 
<br>soon.  Siniora continued that Lebanon was encouraged by and 
<br>supportive of President Obama's efforts to reach a 
<br>comprehensive Middle East Peace, but cautioned that 
<br>Palestinian resettlement should not come at the expense of 
<br>Lebanon.    Siniora encouraged the U.S. to push Syria to 
<br>respect the sovereignty of other states (namely Lebanon) as a 
<br>way to bring Syria back into the Arab fold, rather than 
<br>continuing to align itself with Iran.  General Petraeus hoped 
<br>that the obvious cracks in the Iranian system (illustrated by 
<br>the demonstrations that followed the Iranian elections) would 
<br>distract Iran from malign ambitions in the region.  He also 
<br>briefed Siniora on U.S. military assistance in Pakistan and 
<br>Afghanistan.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (SBU) Meeting General Petraeus at his downtown Beirut 
<br>residence, Siniora was accompanied by his senior advisor Rola 
<br>Noureddine.  General Petraeus and the Ambassador were 
<br>accompanied by Colonel Bjarne (Michael) Iverson, Executive 
<br>Officer; Colonel Mike Bell, Director - Commander's 
<br>Initiatives Group; Sadi Othman, Cultural Advisor and 
<br>Translator; Ali Khedery, Advisor; Lieutenant Colonel Dave 
<br>Wilson, Lebanon Desk Officer, Embassy Defense Attache 
<br>Lieutenant Colonel James Lantz, Office of Defense Cooperation 
<br>Chief Colonel Joshua Berisford and an Embassy notetaker. 
<br> 
<br>LEBANON: A "MODEL" 
<br>FOR THE REGION 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) Caretaker Prime Minister Fouad Siniora welcomed the 
<br>one-day visit of the Commanding General of U.S. Central 
<br>Command (CENTCOM) General David Petraeus to Beirut on June 
<br>¶30.  Siniora expressed his thanks for sustained U.S. military 
<br>assistance to Lebanon and asserted that U.S. security 
<br>assistance had contributed to the positive outcome of the 
<br>June 7 Lebanese parliamentary elections.  Siniora said he was 
<br>"quite satisfied" that the majority March 14 coalition had 
<br>shown that its majority was decisive and not "fictitious," as 
<br>it had been described by others after the previous elections 
<br>in 2005.  He described the electoral outcome as  vote for the 
<br>state and its institutions.  Siniora said that although 
<br>Lebanon was not the most important country in the world and 
<br>despite minor irregularities in the conduct of the elections, 
<br>Lebanon had shown that it could be a model of diversity and 
<br>democracy -- without outside interference -- in the region. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) General Petraeus congratulated Siniora on winning his 
<br>own electoral campaign and the Lebanese people for conducting 
<br>peaceful elections.  In addition, he expressed hope that the 
<br>new cabinet would be formed soon.  Siniora predicted the 
<br>government formation would likely "take some time" because of 
<br>debate about "blocking third" veto power for the opposition. 
<br> 
<br>MIDDLE EAST PEACE: 
<br>NOT AT THE EXPENSE 
<br>OF LEBANON 
<br>------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Siniora said that Lebanon was encouraged by and 
<br> 
<br>supportive of President Obama's commitment to achieving a 
<br>comprehensive Middle East Peace.  He said the U.S. 
<br>administration's recognition of the centrality of the 
<br>Israeli-Palestinian conflict was an opportunity to push the 
<br>Arab Peace Initiative forward and to finally achieve a 
<br>resolution.  The Israelis, however, were being uncooperative, 
<br>he accused.  In his June 14 speech, Israeli PM Benjamin 
<br>Netanyahu had said "yes" to a two-state solution with but 
<br>added "a thousand no's," Siniora analyzed.  The ultimate fate 
<br>of Palestinian refugees, could not come at the expense of 
<br>Lebanon, Siniora cautioned. (Note: Lebanon has 12 Palestinian 
<br>rfugee camps.  The GOL maintains that the Palestinins 
<br>should have the "right of return" and is agaist permanent 
<br>resettlement ("tawteen") in Lebanon.  End note.) 
<br> 
<br>SYRIA 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) Syria, Siniora said, has geopolitical significance. 
<br>He said Lebanon desired a mutually respectful relationship 
<br>with Syria and lauded the establishment of diplomatic 
<br>relations between Lebanon and Syria as a good first step. 
<br>However, other issues, such as border delineation and the 
<br>presence of PFLP-GC military camps, supported by Syria, on 
<br>the border, remain.  Siniora commented on the signs of 
<br>increased U.S. engagement with Syria, but he advised the 
<br>United States to be careful not to give any rewards to Syria 
<br>without Syria taking action first.  Most importantly, the 
<br>U.S. should not allow Syria -- or other states in the region 
<br>-- to use Lebanon as a platform or battleground; engagement 
<br>with Syria should not come at the expense of Lebanon, Siniora 
<br>said. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) General Petraeus assured Siniora that the U.S. 
<br>administration understood Lebanon's concerns.  He told 
<br>Siniora that Syrian President Bashar Asad had invited him to 
<br>visit several times, but the time was not yet appropriate. 
<br>Syria, he added, continues to allow Al Qaeda-affiliated 
<br>facilitation networks to operate from its territory and allow 
<br>the transit of suicide bombers into Iraq.  General Petraeus 
<br>added that the U.S. would like to see Syria return to the 
<br>Arab world and develop closer ties to the western world, 
<br>rather than continue to align itself with Iran. 
<br> 
<br>IRAN 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (C) On Iran, General Petraeus said that the crisis 
<br>following Iran's June 12 presidential election had revealed 
<br>significant cracks in the Iranian system.  He said the 
<br>announced outcome of the election and subsequent 
<br>demonstrations showed that the "urban street" and the "young 
<br>street" were not supportive of Iranian Supreme Leader 
<br>Ayatollah Khamenei.  Candidly, the U.S. would like these 
<br>events to distract Iran for awhile from its other ambitions, 
<br>such as pursuing its nuclear program, General Petraeus said. 
<br>Although, it was too early to determine whether the current 
<br>crisis had any significant impact on Iran's ability to 
<br>support Hamas, Hizballah, or limit its ability to train and 
<br>support foreign fighters in Iraq, he added.  Siniora agreed 
<br>that there were definite cracks in the Iranian system and the 
<br>internal divisions should be exploited.  However, Siniora 
<br>warned against Israel taking any military action against Iran 
<br>saying such action would only make the regional situation 
<br>worse. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (C) General Petraeus responded that it was not the U.S. 
<br>desire to see outside force used against Iran.  Nonetheless, 
<br>he observed, there was a phenomenon in the Gulf states where 
<br>leaders were worried someone would strike Iran's nuclear 
<br>weapons program, while also worrying that someone would not. 
<br>Iran, he continued, had become CENTCOM's best recruiting 
<br>tool, and the number of partnerships and U.S. military 
<br>assistance agreements with Arab partners in the Gulf had 
<br>increased significantly. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>PAKISTAN AND 
<br>AFGHANISTAN 
<br>------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) Turning to other international developments, Siniora 
<br>said he had heard a rumor that Pakistan was ready to sell 
<br>some of its nuclear stock to other countries.  General 
<br>Petraeus responded that this was almost certainly a rumor, 
<br>but he refused to discount the possibility that Gulf states 
<br>may "start shopping" if Iran acquired a nuclear weapon 
<br>capability.  He added that during his recent visit to 
<br>Pakistan, it was clear that for the first time the Pakistani 
<br>military viewed the Taliban and other extremist groups as an 
<br>existential threat to Pakistan.  The Pakistani people, 
<br>General Petraeus continued, were hugely supportive of its 
<br>military's efforts to fight against this extremist threat. 
<br>There were some early signs of some success from Pakistani 
<br>operations. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) In Afghanistan, the U.S. was increasing its troop 
<br>levels by 38,000 from the beginning of 2009 and doubling the 
<br>number of its helicopters, General Petraeus said.  The war in 
<br>Afghanistan would be tough, and not easily won.  One key will 
<br>be the ability of the Afghan government to "step up" to 
<br>provide governance and be seen to serve the people in areas 
<br>that have been cleared by Coalition and Afghan forces.. 
<br>Afghanistan's presidential election was scheduled for August 
<br>20, General Petraeus added.  It was likely, but not 
<br>guaranteed that current Afghan President Hamid Karzai would 
<br>win, he predicted. 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (U) CENTCOM Commander General Petraeus has cleared this 
<br>message.
