<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The CDA paid a courtesy call November 18 on Brazilian 
<br>Ministry of External Relations (MRE or Itamaraty) 
<br>Secretary-General (Deputy Minister) Antonio Patriota. 
<br>Patriota has just taken up his duties following three years 
<br>as Brazil,s ambassador to Washington. Patriota said he sees 
<br>great potential for U.S.-Brazil relations to develop, but 
<br>stressed the need for high-level USG visits and a 
<br>comprehensive strategic bilateral mechanism in order to avoid 
<br>the appearance of neglect and to minimize the negative 
<br>affects on U.S.-Latin America relations of the Honduras 
<br>situation and the U.S.-Colombia bases agreement. Patriota 
<br>raised concerns about a pending Tropical Forests Conservation 
<br>Act agreement and defended Brazil,s invitation to Iranian 
<br>President Ahmadinejad (reftel). Unlike his anti-American and 
<br>obstructionist predecessor, Patriota is eager to engage the 
<br>United States. But he will do so on the basis of a 
<br>traditional Itamaraty nationalist perspective that remains 
<br>cautious and often suspicious regarding U.S. actions and 
<br>motives. End summary. 
<br>
<br>- - - High-Level Visits, Dialogue, Thinking Needed in 
<br>Relationship - - - 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Patriota began by saying -- and repeated twice more 
<br>over the course of the conversation -- how important it is 
<br>for U/S Bill Burns to visit Brazil before the end of the 
<br>year, so that Brazil can receive Secretary Clinton and 
<br>President Lula early in 2010. He noted that President Lula 
<br>will be traveling a great deal in the first semester of 2010, 
<br>and that the second semester will be out of the question in 
<br>light of Brazil,s October elections. Patriota said the 
<br>high-level visits are important for the tone of the 
<br>relationship with Latin America as a whole, and Brazil in 
<br>particular. They will allow our differences to be seen 
<br>within a larger, and overall, positive context. Although he 
<br>has been the first to stress quality of contact over 
<br>quantity, he said there is a growing sense of neglect, which 
<br>is made worse by disagreements over Honduras and the 
<br>U.S.-Colombia base agreement. "We need new developments," he 
<br>said. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The CDA asked Patriota,s views on the prospects for 
<br>the relationship. Patriota said he thought the relationship 
<br>could "go very far," but that it will require new, creative 
<br>thinking on both sides. He identified trilateral cooperation 
<br>in Africa, defense, the Joint Action Plan to Eliminate Racial 
<br>Discrimination, UN Security Council matters (in particular, 
<br>peacekeeping and post-conflict situations), and the Middle 
<br>East as areas where U.S.-Brazil cooperation could grow. The 
<br>relationship needs to be more strategic, he said, which is 
<br>why it is so important to create a "comprehensive mechanism" 
<br>to provide our various bilateral dialogues with "strategic 
<br>direction from policymakers." 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Patriota said that Brazil will not "privilege one 
<br>relationship to the detriment of others." But he said he has 
<br>great admiration for President Obama as he addresses the 
<br>recession and the healthcare in the United States, and that 
<br>our countries should "work more on what Obama represents to 
<br>the world: an effort to unite people, rather than separate 
<br>the world into 'good guys and bad guys'." 
<br>
<br>- - - Concerns about TFCA - - - 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) In addition to raising the upcoming visit of Iranian 
<br>President Ahmadinejad (septel), the CDA asked about prospects 
<br>for concluding a TFCA agreement by Treasury's deadline of 
<br>November 30. (Note: The TFCA agreement has been in 
<br>negotiation for over two years, and had sat for months on the 
<br>desk of Patriota,s predecessor. End note.) Patriota said 
<br>
<br>BRASILIA 00001342 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>that MRE had no problems with the agreement, but "other 
<br>agencies" had concerns about the agreement. For example, the 
<br>GOB did not want funds going to projects in the Amazon, and 
<br>wanted only Brazilian NGOs and agencies to have access to the 
<br>funds. He said that Brazil would present a 
<br>"counter-proposal" within a week. (Comment: Post has since 
<br>received and sent to Treasury a non-paper outlining generally 
<br>the concerns. It is not yet clear whether these can be 
<br>addressed before the deadline. End comment.) 
<br>
<br>- - - Honduras, Colombia Bases Not Positive for U.S. 
<br>Relations - - - 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The CDA asked how Patriota saw the situation in 
<br>Honduras shaping up. Patriota said that the situation was 
<br>"not positive for relations between the United States and 
<br>Latin America." Some sort of "fig-leaf" was required to 
<br>allow Zelaya,s reinstatement prior to elections by a 
<br>sufficient margin for all to "save face." For example, the 
<br>elections could be moved back, allowing Zelaya to resume 
<br>office for "at least a couple of weeks" before they occur. 
<br>Without such a solution, Brazil would be unable to recognize 
<br>the elections. Patriota said that the GOB does not want this 
<br>issue to create difficulties between the United States and 
<br>Latin America, and was heartened that WHA A/S Valenzuela had 
<br>agreed in their meeting the previous week with Brazil,s view 
<br>that the Micheletti regime was not fulfilling the deal struck 
<br>with Zelaya. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The CDA raised the U.S.-Colombia bases agreement, 
<br>saying we the text of that agreement made clear, and we had 
<br>reiterated to the GOB on many occasions, that our bilateral 
<br>work with Colombia to fight terrorism and drug trafficking 
<br>was only within Colombia. Patriota responded that the issue 
<br>has more to do with Colombia than the United States. It is 
<br>Colombia that needs to convince its neighbors of its peaceful 
<br>intentions, and Colombia should agree to a South America-wide 
<br>agreement against military activity, as transparency on this 
<br>issue would benefit Colombia as well as others. Furthermore, 
<br>Colombia needs to reach out to Brazil, in particular, as its 
<br>inability to manage relations with Brazil is making other 
<br>countries wary of its intentions. He noted as a positive 
<br>sign that President Uribe had agreed to attend a regional 
<br>summit in Manaus that Brazil had called to discuss the 
<br>Amazon, and that this would provide an opportunity to discuss 
<br>the bases issue, as well. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Comment: Patriota is a definite improvement over his 
<br>predecessor, the anti-American and obstructionist Samuel 
<br>Pinheiro Guimaraes, who was made Minister of Strategic 
<br>Planning when he hit mandatory retirement age for the 
<br>diplomatic corps this month. Nonetheless, although Patriota 
<br>knows the United States well and is ready to engage us, he 
<br>will do so not from a pro-American perspective, but on the 
<br>basis of a traditional Itamaraty nationalist perspective, in 
<br>line with the views of FM Amorim, that remains cautious and 
<br>often suspicious regarding U.S. actions and motives. Even in 
<br>this brief courtesy call, Patriota made clear that, as Brazil 
<br>seeks engagement with the United States, it will do so on its 
<br>own terms.
