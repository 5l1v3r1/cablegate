<br>
<br>(U) SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED--NOT FOR INTERNET DISTRIBUTION. 
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) Summary: Unrealistic public expectations for the outcome 
<br>of COP-15 and initial confusion over how to interpret the Copenhagen 
<br>Accord led to intense media and opposition questioning of Denmark's 
<br>role as host of the conference, in particular focused on PM Lars 
<br>Loekke Rasmussen's performance as President of the COP. In 
<br>response, the Government has defended the Copenhagen Accord as the 
<br>best outcome possible at COP-15 and a positive step forward toward a 
<br>legally binding agreement, and public interest appears to be 
<br>shifting to other issues. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) While it remains publicly committed to pursue a legally 
<br>binding accord under its COP presidency (which ends in December when 
<br>Mexico assumes that role at the next COP in Cancun), we note signs 
<br>that the Government seeks to play a less exposed role in 
<br>international negotiations this year, preferring to work privately 
<br>with the UN, Mexico, and the EU in search of a way forward. Denmark 
<br>will continue to be a useful partner on climate, especially on 
<br>Copenhagen Accord implementation, and we will continue to work 
<br>closely with the Government and others in pursuit of shared 
<br>interests. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) The Danish Government (like the USG) admits that the 
<br>Copenhagen Accord did not fulfil all its hopes for COP-15, but 
<br>defends the Accord as an important outcome of the COP-15 climate 
<br>conference. Critics, including the parliamentary opposition, have 
<br>criticized the Accord for its non-binding nature and criticized PM 
<br>Lars Loekke Rasmussen for a weak performance as President of the 
<br>15th Conference of Parties (COP-15) climate conference held in 
<br>Copenhagen December 7-18, 2009 (for a complete description of the 
<br>COP-15 endgame and results, see Ref A). 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) National media have fully aired opinions about the 
<br>handling and results of this historic event for Denmark, to the 
<br>point where public interest is beginning to reach saturation levels. 
<br>Most awkward for the Government has been a focus on the PM's 
<br>performance during COP-15. Danish conservative daily 'Berlingske 
<br>Tidende' cites an unnamed Foreign Ministry source who reportedly 
<br>witnessed an angry Prime Minister dressing down his leading climate 
<br>advisor, Bo Lidegaard, in front of Danish delegates during COP15 
<br>after feeling himself humiliated by foreign diplomats when he 
<br>assumed the chair of the conference as it entered the crucial final 
<br>days. Press have also highlighted procedural errors made by 
<br>Rasmussen while in the chair, and the opposition has criticized the 
<br>PM for "throwing in the towel" by giving up the chair in the waning 
<br>hours of the conference after being thwarted by stubborn opposition 
<br>from the ALBA countries to COP approval of the Copenhagen Accord. 
<br>One anonymous analyst charged that the PM was unprepared to assume 
<br>leadership over this international event, and letting him do so was 
<br>equivalent to "throwing him to the sharks." 
<br>
<br>Defending the Accord 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) In several public appearances since COP-15, PM Rasmussen 
<br>and new Climate Minister Lykke Friis have answered pointed questions 
<br>from the press and the opposition on the significance of the 
<br>Copenhagen Accord and the way ahead before Parliament. While freely 
<br>admitting the Accord was not ideal, they have defended it as the 
<br>best agreement possible at COP-15, and an important step forward 
<br>towards a binding international agreement to address climate change. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) In an appearance before Parliament on January 26, the PM 
<br>was faulted by the opposition for his inability to push through a 
<br>legally binding agreement. Social Democrat climate spokesperson 
<br>Mette Gjerskov criticized a "much too close" Danish alliance with 
<br>the U.S. in the lead-up to the COP, saying "it was not enough just 
<br>to get Obama to town and hope to then buy the votes of developing 
<br>nations." Gjerskov said the PM had chaired COP-15 "as though it was 
<br>a village hall discussion, not a gathering of world leaders," and 
<br>urged the government to admit its mistakes and assume greater 
<br>responsibility for the negotiating process in the lead-up to COP-16 
<br>in Mexico. Continuing, she declared that "it is now over a month 
<br>since delegates saw their COP15 chairman throw in the towel and walk 
<br>out of the conference and nobody has seen or heard from him since. 
<br>No meetings have been called, no strategy has been laid out. 
<br>Where's the leadership? Our Prime Minister seems to be suffering 
<br>from a climate coma." 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) In response, PM Rasmussen defended the accord as the best 
<br>possible outcome and a reflection of "the art of the possible" and 
<br>"the reality of the situation." The PM said the Copenhagen Accord 
<br>was an important step forward towards a binding agreement that 
<br>remains the end goal of the Government. While acknowledging the 
<br>
<br>COPENHAGEN 00000069 002.4 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>opposition had a right to try to label the outcome of the COP a 
<br>'disaster,' the PM said that view displayed "a very modest 
<br>understanding of what was--and is--at stake in the international 
<br>climate debate." On forming alliances, the PM dismissed the 
<br>criticism and indicated that he sees a much broader alliance behind 
<br>the Copenhagen Accord. The accord, he said, was supported by 
<br>countries responsible for more than 80 percent of global 
<br>CO2-emissions. 
<br>
<br>Friis to the Front--Still Ambitious 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Climate and Energy Minister Lykke Friis, who assumed her 
<br>ministerial duties when her predecessor, Connie Hedegaard, stepped 
<br>down just before COP-15 (see Ref B), told Parliament on January 26 
<br>that Denmark was committed to pursuing international collaboration 
<br>on climate change along all tracks (i.e. UN, Kyoto, Copenhagen 
<br>Accord). 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) To do so, she said, Denmark will specifically: 
<br>--Work with EU and other developed countries on delivering the 
<br>finance outlined in the accord; 
<br>--coordinate its efforts with the UN, Mexico, Germany (for the June 
<br>UNFCCC meeting in Bonn); 
<br>--keep working through diplomatic channels, via its embassy climate 
<br>attaches in strategic countries (adding a new one in Mexico City and 
<br>extending its current attache in South Africa, in anticipation of 
<br>South Africa's hosting of COP-17 in 2011); 
<br>--the Minister said she would attend the World Economic Forum in 
<br>Doha January 26-27, and would subsequently visit Delhi (Feb 5-6, 
<br>coupled with a visit to Beijing). 
<br>(Note: Friis' staff told REO on January 26 that she is also 
<br>considering whether and when to continue her predecessor's 
<br>"Greenland Dialogue" process.) 
<br>
<br>But Not Too Ambitious 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) PM Rasmussen has flatly rejected calls from the 
<br>opposition and - intriguingly - from some within the governing 
<br>coalition (specifically from the Conservative Party of former 
<br>Climate Minister and EC Commissioner-designate Connie Hedegaard), 
<br>for more ambitious international leadership by Denmark on climate 
<br>issues in the wake of COP-15. On January 13 during another 
<br>appearance before Parliament, the PM was denounced by Social Liberal 
<br>Party leader Margrethe Vestager for "trying to lead from the back 
<br>seat." Instead, she said, "Denmark could do something on its own. 
<br>We should say: first we will go for 30 percent, and we are willing 
<br>to go even further." 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Rasmussen responded that "we could say 100 percent. We 
<br>could declare that we will end the consumption of fossil fuels by 
<br>the end of the year, then we would have made a marginal, marginal 
<br>contribution to the fight against global warming. Because even if 
<br>we did, even if the whole EU did, even if all developed nations of 
<br>the world did it, it would still not be enough to reach the 2 
<br>degrees target. We would then probably have set ourselves some 
<br>challenges that are...very challenging financially. It's about 
<br>balance. And I accept that there is a positive competitive effect 
<br>of being a frontrunner, but there is also a competitive disadvantage 
<br>by being too much of a front-runner, and therefore the right place 
<br>for this discussion right here and now is (within) the EU." 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) COP-15 was certainly a disappointment to the Danish 
<br>Government in that it did not provide the public relations boost it 
<br>had hoped for. Yet neither was it a bust--the opposition has not 
<br>been noticeably boosted, and recriminations over COP-15 seem to be 
<br>losing public interest, especially as implementation of the 
<br>Copenhagen Accord gathers steam. Instead, Danes seem eager to leave 
<br>the mixed results of COP-15 behind, choosing to move on to focus 
<br>political debate on other issues. Polls show a slight opposition 
<br>lead over the government, but that edge was not significantly 
<br>affected by COP-15. That said, emerging disagreements within the 
<br>governing coalition and with the opposition over international 
<br>climate negotiations have the potential to play out further, with 
<br>electoral implications. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) While the outcome of COP-15 is not directly destabilizing 
<br>the Rasmussen Government in the short term, the PM appears chastened 
<br>by his experience and unlikely to risk further high-stakes 
<br>appearances on the international stage. We expect Minister Friis to 
<br>now assume a more visible role enunciating Danish climate policy, as 
<br>Denmark transitions to a more modest role in international 
<br>negotiations. As COP-15 president for the remainder of 2010, 
<br>however, Denmark will remain an important player in international 
<br>climate negotiations, and we will continue to work together with the 
<br>
<br>COPENHAGEN 00000069 003.4 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Government on shared interests in encouraging full implementation of 
<br>the Copenhagen Accord and building support for an effective 
<br>international agreement. In coordination with the Department, we 
<br>will engage with Minister Friis to exchange views on the best way 
<br>forward.
