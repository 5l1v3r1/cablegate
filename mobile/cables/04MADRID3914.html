<br>REF: A) MADRID 3552 B) BRUSSELS 4080 C) SAINZ E-MAIL
<br>
<br>OF 10/6 D) STATE 215870
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Kathy Fitzpatrick; reasons 1.5 (B) a
<br>nd (D).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Poloff contacted MFA Deputy Director General for
<br>Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean Pedro Gomez de
<br>Olea on 10/7 to discuss reports that the Spanish Embassy in
<br>Havana was planning to break with EU policy by not inviting
<br>dissidents to its national day reception on 10/12. Gomez de
<br>Olea, who had clearly anticipated poloff's call, said he had
<br>no information to provide because the decision on whether to
<br>invite dissidents would be made by Foreign Minister Moratinos
<br>himself. He said that, to his knowledge, no final decision
<br>had been made.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Gomez de Olea (please protect) indicated a certain
<br>exasperation with the issue, saying it had been his
<br>understanding that the GOS would comply with EU policies
<br>calling for the inclusion of national day event, but that it
<br>now seemed FM Moratinos felt he had to make the decision
<br>himself. Gomez de Olea said it was likely no decision would
<br>be made until right before the 10/12 event and that he would
<br>likely learn of it at the same time we did. He added that it
<br>was well known that the GOS wanted to revisit EU measures
<br>against the GOC to find "more effective" tools, but his tone
<br>suggested frustration with the way in which the issue of
<br>invitations is being handled by FM Moratinos.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Poloff inquired about the accuracy of news reports
<br>that Cuban FM Perez Roque had told Moratinos in New York that
<br>noted political prisoner Raul Rivero would not be released if
<br>Spain invited dissidents to its national day event, comments
<br>which Popular Party politicians denounced as blackmail.
<br>Gomez de Olea scoffed, saying that Perez Roque had not made
<br>such a statement, but that in fact his comments were even
<br>"more insulting" than those reported. He said Perez Roque
<br>demanded not only the lifting of EU measures undertaken in
<br>the wake of the 2003 GOC crackdown on dissident, but also the
<br>full revision of the EU Common Position to remove all
<br>European political conditions on improved ties with Cuba.
<br>
<br>//CUBAN ANTI-EMBARGO RESOLUTION//
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Poloff took advantage of the conversation to review
<br>ref D points regarding the upcoming Cuba embargo resolution.
<br>Gomez de Olea said Spain would hew closely to past EU
<br>practice, including voting in favor of the Cuban resolution
<br>while criticizing GOC human rights practices in an
<br>Explanation of Vote. This was GOS policy under the Aznar
<br>Government as well. We will follow up by delivering ref D
<br>points to the MFA Office of UN Affairs.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Moratinos' positions on Cuba continue to undermine the
<br>Zapatero Administration's contention that human rights will
<br>remain on the forefront of GOS policy towards Cuba. Instead,
<br>Moratinos appears to favor "dialogue at any cost" with
<br>respect to Cuba and seems willing to risk the ire of both the
<br>EU and the USG in order to improve relations with the GOC.
<br>Even if Moratinos does opt to invite dissidents, this episode
<br>makes it abundantly clear that the GOS will continue to chip
<br>away at EU resolve to hold the GOC to at least minimal human
<br>rights standards. Given Spanish public opposition to U.S.
<br>policy towards Cuba, the Zapatero Government could be tempted
<br>to portray any rapprochement with Havana as yet another
<br>demonstration of its "independence" f<br>
