<br>
<br>Rokg reaction
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) xxxxx that despite its
<br>decision to suspend humanitarian aid to the DPRK, it would
<br>ship another 24,700 metric tons of fertilizer 6-7 July. This
<br>final shipment will complete the delivery to the North of the
<br>pledge of 350,000 metric tons South Korea made earlier this
<br>year. MOU officials have explained that the ROKG is
<br>proceeding with this shipment because it is a small, final
<br>portion of a pledged commitment.
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Unification Minister Lee Jong-seok on July 6 told the
<br>National Assembly Unification, Foreign Affairs, and Trade
<br>Committee that Seoul would hold inter-Korean ministerial
<br>talks set for July 11-14 in Busan as scheduled, adding that
<br>it was not consistent to urge the North to return to talks
<br>over its nuclear weapons programs but refuse to talk with the
<br>North itself. Lee said it was still important to limit
<br>Seoul's measures against the North to avoid further
<br>escalation on the Peninsula.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The A/DCM xxxxx to verify the items above. In a
<br>frank exchange, A/DCM expressed disappointment that things
<br>appeared to be "business-as-usual," with the shipment of
<br>fertilizer this week and the holding of inter-Korean
<br>ministerials next week. This was sending the wrong signals
<br>to Pyongyang for its inexcusable behavior, A/DCM said.
<br>xxxxx replied that a lot of internal
<br>discussions had taken place, but that political-levels
<br>concluded that breaking off the dialogue was not wise because
<br>restarting it would be too costly and difficult. Moreover,
<br>the dialogue must be used to send a stern message to North
<br>Korea. Next week the ROK delegation would definitely make
<br>the point that Pyongyang's demand for an additional 100,000
<br>tons of fertilizer and 500,000 tons of rice was threatened.
<br>Also, in response to the missile launches, xxxxx, Seoul
<br>had decided to cancel North-South military liaison officers'
<br>talks that were planned for July 7, which essentially meant
<br>that General Officers' talks would not be held as hoped. In
<br>addition, Seoul was holding back on approving new investment
<br>permits for the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC). A/DCM
<br>encouraged xxxxx develop further measures and to publicize
<br>them (septel).
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Senior Secretary for National Security Suh Choo-suk
<br>said on the radio on July 6 that the ROKG has initially
<br>concluded that the DPRK's failed missile launch was due to a
<br>technical failure. He also defended the ROKG's reaction to
<br>the missile launches as quick and appropriate.
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) ROK Defense Minister Yoon Kwang-woong on July 6 told
<br>the National Assembly Defense Committee that the North might
<br>launch more missiles, citing an assessment of the equipment
<br>and groups going to and from the launch sites during DPRK
<br>preparations over the past two months. He also rejected the
<br>argument of an opposition lawmaker that there was a delay in
<br>the ROKG reaction to the launches. Separately, an unnamed
<br>senior official at the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff publicly
<br>denied media reports that the DPRK was preparing to launch a
<br>second Taepodong II missile.
<br>.
<br>Political reaction
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) During a July 6 opposition Grand National Party (GNP)
<br>leaders' meeting, the GNP criticized the ROKG for its "idle"
<br>approach to the DPRK missile launches and called for the
<br>resignation of all the security-related ministers. The GNP
<br>proposed a national investigation on the ROKG's reaction,
<br>proposed an "emergency National Assembly committee," and
<br>urged the ROKG to review its inter-Korean policies, including
<br>the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the Geumgang Tourism Project,
<br>and humanitarian assistance. xxxxx told
<br>xxxxx that all cash support to the DPRK should be stopped
<br>and that sending fertilizer north as missiles were being
<br>fired was "nonsensical." xxxxx predicted that the missile
<br>test could have a deciding effect on the July 11 GNP party
<br>chair selection, to replace xxxxx who stepped down
<br>last month. xxxxx said the lawmaker who could make people
<br>feel the most secure would be selected and hinted that Kang
<br>Jae-sup, with his more conservative prosecutor's background,
<br>might be the more attractive choice in light of the current
<br>situation.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The spokesman for smaller opposition Democratic Party
<br>(DP)xxxxx stated that the ROKG should recognize the
<br>importance of closely coordinating with Washington and Tokyo
<br>and improve its crisis management system that the DP said
<br>failed to operate effectively. One Democratic Party staffer
<br>noted to poloff that the missile tests should be viewed as "a
<br>test" and nothing more.
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) The progressive Democratic Labor Party (DLP)
<br>spokesman said xxxxx that the ROKG should maintain
<br>dialogue with the DPRK and prevent further DPRK provocations.
<br>At the same time, the ROKG should encourage Washington to
<br>negotiate directly with Pyongyang.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Several Uri Party staffers told poloff that further
<br>assistance would be difficult due to the lack of popular
<br>support, but that aid already agreed upon should continue.
<br>One staffer noted that the tests put the Uri Party in a
<br>"difficult position" because they showed the ineffectiveness
<br>of the current engagement policy. The Uri Party echoed much
<br>of the GNP's frustration with the related ministers, but
<br>stopped short of calling for them to step down. A common
<br>theme also heard was that the ROK reaction to the tests was
<br>"by the manual" developed by the Uri Party and not late at
<br>all.
<br>.
<br>Press coverage
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶10. (U) ROK media reports on July 6 highlighted UNSC
<br>discussions, criticisms that Seoul was caught flat-footed,
<br>and speculations about DPRK motivations and prospects for
<br>inter-Korean relations. The Dong-A Ilbo, a moderate daily,
<br>criticized the ROKG government for responding too slowly,
<br>delivering a weaker announcement than Washington or Tokyo,
<br>and for poorly coordinating with the USG, which, the paper
<br>said, created the information lag.
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) As to why the North launched the missiles, opinions
<br>ranged from (1) to get attention and negotiation leverage;
<br>(2) to use for internal purpose to demonstrate DPRK strength;
<br>and/or (3) for technical reasons to demonstrate DPRK missile
<br>achievement. The progressive Hankyoreh opined that the
<br>timing of the launch, on July 4, was special because it was
<br>the 34th anniversary of the North-South Joint Statement from
<br>1972, and it was the U.S. Independence Day, suggesting that
<br>the DPRK was exhibiting brinkmanship and wanted to generate
<br>more attention.
<br>
<br>¶12. (U) Press stories quoted some analysts who opined that
<br>North Korea might stand to gain from the launches. Kim
<br>Tae-hyo, a political scientist at Sungkyunkwan University,
<br>was quoted as saying that Kim Jong-il probably gambled that
<br>Beijing and Seoul would not change their stances and that
<br>this gamble was likely to pay off. Paik Hak-soon, a senior
<br>researcher at Sejong Institute, suggested that the DPRK
<br>launch was probably an effort to strengthen its position in
<br>the Six Party Talks because it was unsatisfied with proposed
<br>compensation for scrapping its nuclear programs. Peter Beck,
<br>Director of the International Crisis Group's Seoul office
<br>said that at most Seoul would probably only delay aid
<br>shipments, versus a real change in its current policies.
<br>.
<br>Dprk watchers caution against sanctions at symposium
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) The prevailing sentiment among North Korea experts
<br>gathered at a July 6 symposium in Seoul on North Korean
<br>Development and International Cooperation was for all parties
<br>to exercise restraint in responding to the North Korean
<br>missile launches.
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Amb. Sun Jun-young, Professor at Kyungnam
<br>University and Former ROK Ambassador to the UN, said that the
<br>missile launches were the DPRK's "last card" and showed not
<br>its strength, but its weakness.xxxxx
<br>that the DPRK felt so pressured by U.S. banking sanctions
<br>that it felt compelled to show its might in some manner. xxxxx
<br>believed that it would be a mistake to punish DPRK with
<br>sanctions and that it would be a mistake for the ROKG to
<br>suspend ministerial discussions scheduled for July 11. The
<br>best decision, he said, would be to perhaps delay the
<br>meetings, but to keep lines of communication open.
<br>
<br>¶15. (SBU) xxxxx that the
<br>Bush Administration's "neglect and containment policy" caused
<br>North Korea to break its moratorium on missile testing. xxxxx
<br>expressed concern that the launches would result in
<br>sanctions. According xxxxx, every time sanctions were
<br>applied to North Korea, the nuclear and missile situation
<br>became aggravated. He said that the missile launches were a
<br>signal from North Korea to the United States that it wanted
<br>direct negotiations. Kyungnam University Prof. Lim Eul-chul
<br>also said that the missile launches appeared to be a way of
<br>bringing the United States back to the negotiating table. It
<br>was North Korea's way of getting American attention, he
<br>shrugged.
<br>
<br>¶16. (SBU)xxxxx
<br>that it would not be helpful to cut off assistance and
<br>contacts, particularly in a time of crisis. It would be
<br>important to keep channels of communication open in order to
<br>facilitate an exchange of positions.
<br>
<br>¶17. (SBU) Visiting xxxxx that
<br>the best reaction to the launches would be to continue with
<br>business as usual. He said that to overreact would be to
<br>play into North Korea's expectations and fulfill its goal of
<br>seeking attention. By minimizing public reaction and
<br>continuing to seek opportunities for exchange and assistance,
<br>there would be greater possibility of making a long-term,
<br>positive impact. Also, imposing sanctions would only harm
<br>ordinary North Koreans, who had nothing to do with the
<br>missile launches. xxxxx advised at most a delay in
<br>engagement activity with the DPRK.
<br>
<br>¶18. (SBU) xxxxx, likened the missile crisis to a cold winter
<br>before a warm spring. He criticized the USG for taking a
<br>harsh line toward North Korea and precipitating the current
<br>situation. But, he said, the situation could be salvaged if
<br>the USG provided a security guarantee and food to North
<br>Korea. This, he said, would initiate the process of
<br>separating the regime from its leaders.xxxxx said
<br>that imposing sanctions would be as effective as a dog
<br>barking outside a city's walls. It would be much better to
<br>use humanitarian aid like a Trojan Horse to start change from
<br>within.
<br>.
<br>Dprk tourism and kic unaffected by missile launches
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------
<br>
<br>¶19. (SBU) Hyundai Asan President Yoon Man-joon said during
<br>his keynote address at xxxxx that the
<br>launches have had no impact on Hyundai Asan's operations in
<br>North Korea. He said that of the 315 persons scheduled to
<br>tour North Korea's Mt. Geumgang xxxxx, there was only one
<br>cancellation. Noting that far more people usually canceled
<br>at the last minute because of personal reasons, Yoon said
<br>that people seemed determined to continue with their plans.
<br>Yoon added that there has been no abnormal investor activity
<br>with regard to the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) and
<br>predicted that investors who were planning to invest in KIC
<br>would probably delay their investments for a short time, but
<br>then push ahead with their original plans. xxxxx
<br>"political, not military, missiles" and predicted that travel
<br>and investment in the DPRK would remain stable.
