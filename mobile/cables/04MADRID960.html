<br>SUBJECT: DEALING WITH ZAPATERO: AN INEXPERIENCED BUT 
<br>PROBABLY MANAGEABLE PARTNER 
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador George Argyros for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: This message provides initial embassy 
<br>thinking on how to deal with President-Elect Zapatero in the 
<br>lead up to his government's formation and the early stages of 
<br>his administration. Zapatero has no experience in 
<br>administration or foreign affairs. He is likely to be a 
<br>difficult but manageable interlocutor and carries with him 
<br>the Spanish Left's skepticism of U.S. motives. Opposition to 
<br>the war in Iraq is central to Zapatero,s appeal to voters. 
<br>Nonetheless a UNSCR that gave the UN a leading role in the 
<br>Iraq mission could allow Zapatero to save face and agree to 
<br>maintain Spanish forces in Iraq. End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Some things to bear in mind 
<br>
<br>--It is important to recall that Zapatero, who is 43, has no 
<br>experience whatsoever in government administration. He has 
<br>served as a member of the Parliament since he was 26. 
<br>
<br>--The Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) was shocked that 
<br>they won the elections and Zapatero and his people are 
<br>scrambling to figure out what to do. He also made a number 
<br>of campaign statements that might have come out differently 
<br>had he thought he had a real chance of becoming president of 
<br>the government of Spain. 
<br>
<br>--As leader of Spain, Zapatero will be able to draw on some 
<br>experienced PSOE party operatives and experienced diplomats 
<br>and economists such as Miguel Angel Moratinos and Miguel 
<br>Sebastian. But he will also have to make certain he does not 
<br>provoke the image that he is replaying the corrupt government 
<br>of Felipe Gonzalez, the PSOE President of Spain from 
<br>1982-1996. So his team likely will include a mix of 
<br>experienced people and newer and less experienced hands. The 
<br>learning curve will be steep. Zapatero and his team will 
<br>have a certain settling in period once the reality of 
<br>government sets in. 
<br>
<br>--We have already seen some 'wiggle room' in public 
<br>statements on certain issues, including possibly on the pull 
<br>out of Spanish troops from Iraq. Zapatero,s possible 
<br>foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos indicated in the 
<br>March 18 Wall Street Journal that a UN resolution prior to 
<br>June 30 could provide the context in which Spanish troops 
<br>could remain. If by May we are beginning to negotiate a 
<br>resolution and if France and Germany are on board, Zapatero 
<br>might agree to leave the troops in Iraq. 
<br>
<br>--Zapatero will have to work to dispel the image that he won 
<br>because he will appease terrorists (or that he was elected by 
<br>Al-Qaeda). He will almost certainly hear from his European 
<br>colleagues on this issue. He will have to calibrate his 
<br>decisions to avoid the impression that terrorists can 
<br>influence his foreign policy moves. 
<br>
<br>--Though terrorism and foreign policy are now front and 
<br>center for Zapatero, many Spaniards believe his main 
<br>challenge will be handling the increasingly vocal nationalist 
<br>tendencies in Catalonia and the Basque region, which could 
<br>threaten the Spanish constitutional order. Zapatero does not 
<br>have the gravitas nor the credibility to deal with these 
<br>issues effectively, many fear. It is not in the U.S. 
<br>interest to see instability in the Spanish national system. 
<br>
<br>--Under Zapatero, Spain will continue to face a terrorist 
<br>threat, both from Al-Qaeda and from ETA. This is our most 
<br>significant common challenge, on which we should seek to 
<br>build a firm relationship. 
<br>
<br>--On macro-economic issues, we can expect sound policies. 
<br>The PSOE initiated many of the reforms which laid the basis 
<br>for Spain,s current economic success, and Zapatero himself 
<br>has credited the success of Aznar,s economic policies in the 
<br>past. Zapatero has already endorsed PP Minister of Economy 
<br>Rato to head the IMF. There are continued grounds for 
<br>cooperation in this area. 
<br>
<br>--The USG has worked well with previous socialist 
<br>governments. Under Felipe Gonzalez, Spain reaffirmed its 
<br>membership in NATO, despite the Socialists, previous 
<br>opposition to NATO membership. We negotiated a renewal of 
<br>our bilateral defense agreements. There is a positive 
<br>history with PSOE on which to build. 
<br>
<br>--We will have to accept that there are some issues on which 
<br>we will disagree with the Zapatero government. Zapatero,s 
<br>political philosophy, and that of his closest associates, is 
<br>grounded in the European Left,s reflexive skepticism about 
<br>U.S. motives at best, and anti-Americanism at worst. 
<br>
<br>--We have long-term interests in Spain that transcend 
<br>governments in power. Spain is a NATO ally, a strong and 
<br>growing economic force in the EU with shared common 
<br>historical and linguistic links with the Americas. Knowledge 
<br>of and ties with the U.S., however, remain quite thin. 
<br>Zapatero has little understanding of the U.S. 
<br>
<br>--Spanish democracy is still rather immature - less than 30 
<br>years old. The high voter turnout last week was a victory 
<br>for democracy in Spain. We should avoid castigating Spanish 
<br>voters and allow them to come to their own conclusions about 
<br>the government that they have elected, albeit under 
<br>extraordinary circumstances. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Our overall approach 
<br>
<br>--We believe it is in U.S. interest, both for relations with 
<br>Spain and more broadly in Europe and in the Iraq Coalition 
<br>that we allow Zapatero some time before we come to 
<br>conclusions about steps he will take, including on Iraq. 
<br>
<br>--The public line the White House and the Department have 
<br>thus far taken, for example in the White House and Department 
<br>briefings of March 16, is working and we can already see it 
<br>resonating through opinion pieces in Spanish media. This 
<br>will help us avoid an unhelpful U.S.-vs- Zapatero image that 
<br>may be difficult to dispel later on when some rapprochement 
<br>might be possible or needed by us or Spain for other reasons. 
<br>
<br>--Rather, we should emphasize our long-term interests in and 
<br>alliance with Spain, our good relations with the previous 
<br>PSOE government, our shared interest combating terrorism, the 
<br>strength of our economic relations and our shared interest in 
<br>repairing strained transatlantic relations (the theme here is 
<br>that Zapatero need not choose between Europe and the United 
<br>States). 
<br>
<br>--We should allow other European leaders to express their 
<br>concerns to Zapatero about the appearance of giving in to 
<br>terrorism. The views of France and Germany carry particular 
<br>weight with Zapatero. We should offer our support and advice 
<br>in the effort against terrorism, and should continue to do so 
<br>at the highest levels. 
<br>
<br>--We should also emphasize that transatlantic relations and 
<br>close ties with Europe are not either/or propositions. The 
<br>U.S. strongly supports European integration and enlargement. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) It will be important that the USG seek to engage 
<br>Zapatero and his new team at senior levels as soon as 
<br>possible, and continue practical areas of U.S. - Spanish 
<br>cooperation that are outside of the difficult issues such as 
<br>Iraq. 
<br>
<br>Some suggested practical steps: 
<br>
<br>--Secretary Powell connect with probable PSOE Foreign 
<br>Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos as soon as possible. 
<br>
<br>--Presidential letter to Zapatero as soon as he is invested 
<br>(probably in late April); second congratulatory phone call as 
<br>soon as he is in office. 
<br>
<br>--Offer high-level intelligence briefing to Zapatero on 
<br>counter-terrorism and other key world issues. 
<br>
<br>--Suggest that Zapatero would be welcome in Washington as 
<br>soon as he is able to visit. 
<br>
<br>--Engage at high levels on counter-terrorism cooperation, 
<br>with a visit by Secretary Ridge to meet with his counterpart 
<br>(under new ministry name of Ministry of Security) once the 
<br>new government is invested, and follow up at other levels 
<br>immediately. 
<br>
<br>--Suggest regular high-level and working-level consultations 
<br>with new MFA on key issues - Middle East, Latin America, UN 
<br>Security Council issues, human rights, common threats and 
<br>challenges. Public diplomacy outreach the primacy and 
<br>breadth of the U.S. - EU relationship will also be important. 
<br>
<br>--Defense issues: Spain reaffirmed its membership in NATO 
<br>under PSOE government. We should continue our good level of 
<br>defense dialogue, contacts, and cooperation, including in the 
<br>Balkans and Afghanistan; dialogue on Iraq if we get a new UN 
<br>resolution. Continue "business as usual" with 
<br>military-military contacts. 
<br>
<br>--Terrorism Finance: The events of March 11 represent an 
<br>opportunity to persuade Spain to take a greater leadership 
<br>role on these issues in the EU and elsewhere, particularly in 
<br>terms of assistance. Spain had proposed hosting a terrorism 
<br>finance conference early this year. We should convey our 
<br>willingness to support such a conference should the 
<br>government wish to do so. We should also continue our 
<br>willingness to consider Spain for standing membership in the 
<br>CTAG. 
<br>
<br>--Iraq Contracts: The Spanish private sector continues to 
<br>show interest in and frustration with the contracting 
<br>process. We believe Spanish companies have a lot to offer. 
<br>We recommend going ahead with tentative plans to have the 
<br>CPA,s Program Management Office (PMO) brief on 
<br>subcontracting (sponsored by a private sector entity) in late 
<br>April as currently planned. It will demonstrate the possible 
<br>benefits of cooperation. 
<br>
<br>--Trade Issues: We recommend signaling to the new trade team 
<br>a willingness to consult on the Doha Round and progress in 
<br>the FTAA - a likely area of continued interest for the new 
<br>government. 
<br>
<br>--Housing: Zapatero has already signaled that housing will 
<br>be a key issue for his government and has already said he 
<br>will create a housing ministry. Based on the U.S.-Spain 
<br>Housing forums which took place under former HUD Secretary 
<br>Martinez, leadership with the Ministry of Public Works 
<br>(where housing currently stands) suggest a dialogue with HUD 
<br>as soon as this ministry is established, building on ties 
<br>already created, many of which at the working level will 
<br>remain. 
<br>
<br>--R&D/S&T/Productivity: There is a wide scope for increased 
<br>R&D cooperation given that the PSOE platform included a 
<br>pledge to significantly increase the amount of R&D spending. 
<br>Along the same lines, improving worker productivity is 
<br>another key PSOE pledge. As a leader in this area, U.S. may 
<br>be able to share experiences with the new government. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Possible PSOE response 
<br>
<br>--Zapatero likely will prove an inexperienced partner. There 
<br>are a number of issues on which he will clearly differ from 
<br>Aznar, but there are areas on which we can build on long-term 
<br>cooperative efforts. 
<br>
<br>What will change 
<br>
<br>
<br>--From the PSOE side, we can expect some initial reservations 
<br>about our engagement overtures. But as the reality of 
<br>government sets in, Zapatero and his team may welcome a 
<br>matter of fact approach from us focused on practical steps in 
<br>areas on which we can agree. 
<br>
<br>--Zapatero,s European focus will be a key element of his 
<br>foreign policy. He has made it clear he intends to follow 
<br>the lines of France and Germany on most issues. He has 
<br>already said that he will drop Aznar,s insistence in the EU 
<br>constitution debate on maintaining the Nice treaty voting 
<br>formulas. Again, though, as Zapatero realizes he is 
<br>governing one of Europe,s fastest growing economies, he will 
<br>quickly find that on some issues Spain will want to have a 
<br>voice that is separate from those of France and Germany. But 
<br>as our relationship with France and Germany evolves, we may 
<br>find areas of opportunity with Spain under PSOE as well.
