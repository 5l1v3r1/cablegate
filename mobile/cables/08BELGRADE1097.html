<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The Serbian government's cooperation with the
<br>International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has
<br>increased since parliamentary elections in May and took a
<br>dramatic step forward just after the July formation of the
<br>new government with the arrest of wartime Bosnian Serb
<br>political leader Radovan Karadzic. The new government,
<br>unhindered by uncooperative Democratic Party of Serbia
<br>officials in the Security Information Agency and the Interior
<br>Ministry, appears better able to investigate the fugitives'
<br>whereabouts and act on leads. Cross-border information
<br>sharing with NATO in Bosnia has also enhanced the
<br>government's capabilities. The new, pro-Western government,
<br>which ran on an EU integration platform, clearly has the will
<br>to fulfill Serbia,s cooperation obligations. Political
<br>leaders are for the first time talking about the moral
<br>obligation to apprehend fugitives, not just the economic
<br>benefits of joining the EU. While technical cooperation,
<br>including providing wartime documents and finding witness,
<br>will continue until the Tribunal concludes its work, the
<br>government will need to make good on its promise to capture
<br>and extradite the remaining fugitives and close that chapter
<br>of its cooperation obligations once and for all. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Government Cooperation Increased
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Following parliamentary elections in May, the
<br>Serbian government stepped up activity to locate and arrest
<br>the remaining four fugitives indicted for war crimes by the
<br>International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
<br>(ICTY). The Serbian government arrested two of the remaining
<br>four ICTY fugitives, Karadzic advisor Stojan Zupljanin on
<br>June 11 (Ref A), as coalition negotiations were being
<br>finalized, and Karadzic himself on July 21, just two weeks
<br>after the formation of the new Democratic Party-led coalition
<br>government (Ref B). Karadzic's arrest fueled speculation
<br>that the new, European-oriented government would soon arrest
<br>Bosnian Serb wartime military leader Ratko Mladic, who is
<br>accused of master-minding and executing the mass execution of
<br>Bosnian Muslims during five years of war in Bosnia.
<br>Observers had long thought that the arrests of Karadzic and
<br>Mladic, the best known of the remaining four indictees, would
<br>be the most difficult politically for the government given
<br>that many Serbs still deny that the atrocities for which they
<br>are accused took place.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) On October 8, the office of the War Crimes Prosecutor
<br>announced that it had summoned for questioning seven
<br>individuals suspected of helping hide Zupljanin. War Crimes
<br>Prosecutor spokesman Bruno Vekaric said the individuals were
<br>identified in a police investigation into Zupljanin's support
<br>network, which revealed links to the support networks of
<br>other ICTY fugitives, including Mladic and Karadzic. The
<br>investigation had already yielded 30 names, and the operation
<br>would continue for several more days, according to the
<br>statement. (Note: the War Crimes Court has its own police
<br>unit.) War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic told us
<br>privately that the first interrogated suspect, former
<br>Vojvodina Executive Council President Koviljko Lovre,
<br>admitted to assisting Zupljanin.
<br>
<br>New Government More Capable and Willing
<br>---------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Observers have long speculated whether the previous
<br>government knew where Karadzic and Mladic were. Many
<br>believed that the previous government had enough information
<br>to locate the fugitives had it undertaken a vigorous
<br>investigation. Details that have been surfacing about the
<br>arrest of Karadzic suggest this may be true. B92 reported on
<br>September 29 that Security Information Agency (BIA) director
<br>Rade Bulatovic (DSS) had had information on Karadzic's
<br>whereabouts for months. Both Bulatovic and former DSS Prime
<br>Minister Kostunica publicly denied that they had known
<br>Karadzic's whereabouts. A close advisor of Deputy Prime
<br>Minister Ivica Dacic told us that Bulatovic had received the
<br>information six months before the new government formed but
<br>did not act on it, because of DSS Prime Minister Kostunica's
<br>
<br>BELGRADE 00001097 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>ideological kinship with Karadzic and a lack of international
<br>pressure. When the government changed, Bulatovic had
<br>presented the information -- in exchange for the promise of
<br>an ambassadorship -- to Tadic and his National Security
<br>Advisor Miki Rakic, who then planned the arrest (Ref C).
<br>(Note: There are rumors that Bulatovic will be appointed as
<br>Ambassador to Syria.) National Council for Cooperation with
<br>the Hague Tribunal President Rasim Ljajic publicly affirmed
<br>that the government had begun developing information on
<br>Karadzic earlier -- but did not specify when -- and had
<br>arrested him when the security risk was lowest. Vukcevic
<br>told us the arrest had come after a month of tracking
<br>Karadzic's support network and that only three people in the
<br>country had known about the operation in advance, including
<br>himself, new BIA director Sasa Vukadinovic, and Rakic, who
<br>reportedly orchestrated the Zupljanin arrest as well (Ref D).
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Whatever the truth about when the government became
<br>aware of Karadzic's whereabouts, several observers note that
<br>the absence of DSS from the current coalition is key to the
<br>renewed enthusiasm for capturing the fugitives. Humanitarian
<br>Law Center Director Natasa Kandic told us that with Kostunica
<br>gone, the DS now had the political will to complete ICTY
<br>cooperation. ICTY Belgrade chief Deyan Mihov told us that
<br>the atmosphere at BIA was completely different with Sasa
<br>Vukadinovic in charge; cooperation with ICTY Belgrade had
<br>improved markedly. Mihov said Bulatovic was evasive and
<br>"could sell you anything." Bulatovic had consistently
<br>avoided answering Mihov,s questions about whether BIA had
<br>collected any DNA or fingerprints in its investigations of
<br>Karadzic's whereabouts. Our contacts with BIA have also
<br>improved since Vukadinovic took over; he welcomes visits from
<br>the Embassy's Special Assistant Office and has said he wants
<br>to be sure that Mladic is captured on Serbian soil to show
<br>that Serbia is a law-abiding country. President of the
<br>Special War Crimes Court Judge Sinisa Vazic told us that
<br>previous Interior Minister Dragan Jocic (DSS) had politicized
<br>ICTY cooperation and had not operated transparently,
<br>hindering previous cases.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Mihov told us he thought international pressure had
<br>in part been responsible for the government's recent actions,
<br>but that it was clearly willing and able to complete the
<br>arrests with continued encouragement. According to Mihov,
<br>President Tadic told ICTY Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz
<br>(Ref E) that he knew Serbia needed to bring Mladic in to lift
<br>Dutch opposition to Serbia's EU integration, but that Serbia
<br>would capture Hadzic as well because ICTY cooperation was
<br>both a moral and legal obligation. Mihov said Brammertz was
<br>cautiously optimistic that Serbia would capture Mladic within
<br>the next several months.
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Vukcevic's office told us it now had better
<br>information to conduct its investigations, thanks to ongoing
<br>meetings that began in June 2008 between the War Crimes
<br>Prosecution and NATO/U.S. Corp Bosnia, which post
<br>facilitated. Vukcevic said the information exchanged,
<br>particularly on the networks of supporters, enhanced Serbia's
<br>ability to search for ICTY fugitives.
<br>
<br>Government's Message of Moral Responsibility
<br>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) In the months since Karadzic's arrest, President
<br>Tadic, Ljajic, Vukcevic, and other officials have made
<br>several public statements about the importance of capturing
<br>the remaining fugitives, not just for pragmatic reasons but
<br>also because of the need for reconciliation with the past.
<br>DS Vice President Dusan Petrovic assured us that the
<br>government placed importance on helping the public to
<br>understand and overcome the past and promote reconciliation.
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) ICTY Coordination Council Director Dusan Ignjatovic
<br>informed us the government planned a series of public
<br>discussions to explain the events of the 1990s and the
<br>importance of ICTY's work. In cooperation with the OSCE and
<br>ICTY Belgrade, the ICTY Coordination Council held its first
<br>program on August 18 in the eastern Serbian town of Zajecar.
<br>Speakers from OSCE, ICTY, and the Coordination Council
<br>appeared on a local prime time television talk show and took
<br>calls from viewers. Ignatovic said the government was
<br>considering expanding the program to other towns and
<br>eventually broadcasting the discussions on national
<br>broadcaster Radio-Television Serbia. He said that Serbian
<br>citizens would not experience any epiphanies in their
<br>understanding of the events of the 1990s but with careful
<br>messages would eventually come to terms with the past.
<br>Ignjatovic said this message was a tough sell with most
<br>Serbs, since the acquittals in 2008 of Bosniak commander
<br>
<br>BELGRADE 00001097 003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>Naser Oric, acquitted July 3 of murdering Serbian prisoners
<br>of war, and Kosovo Liberation Army commander Rasmush
<br>Haradinaj, acquitted April 3 of targeting and killing
<br>civilians, heightened a sense that ICTY was biased against
<br>Serbia.
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Mihov told us the challenge for the government
<br>would be to compete with sensationalist, nationalist coverage
<br>in the tabloids, which still had a chief role in forming
<br>popular opinion. Mihov said Tadic had confided to Brammertz
<br>that he felt the government had missed an opportunity to
<br>educate people about war crimes immediately after Karadzic's
<br>arrest when the tabloid press was consumed with
<br>sensationalizing details of Karadzic's false identity as a
<br>natural medicine guru. The government needed to show ICTY
<br>indictees as criminals, not heroes, Mihov said.
<br>
<br>Beyond the Arrests
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) The capture of the remaining indictees remains the
<br>most high profile aspect of ICTY cooperation, but there are
<br>other important elements to Serbia's ICTY cooperation, such
<br>as handing over documents to the prosecution and serving
<br>subpoenas to ICTY witnesses. Although these elements are not
<br>as high-profile, ICTY Belgrade's Mihov told us it was
<br>essential for Serbia to continue to cooperate in these areas
<br>in order to obtain a favorable report from Brammertz. Mihov
<br>said Serbia was mostly compliant with this technical
<br>cooperation. For the most part Serbia was complying with
<br>document requests, he said, although ICTY had had to go to
<br>court to obtain some national security-related documents.
<br>The government was still holding out on one document, but
<br>Mihov had high expectations of receiving it. Mihov said
<br>there were also some issues with locating witnesses but most
<br>were not contentious. He added that the ICTY had no
<br>complaints about how the government was handling allegations
<br>of witness intimidation. According to the war crimes
<br>prosecution's statement on the investigation into Zupljanin's
<br>network, one of the elements under investigation was witness
<br>intimidation.
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Serbia is also prosecuting a number of war crimes
<br>cases domestically. War Crimes Court President Judge Sinisa
<br>Vazic told us that cases in the war crimes special court were
<br>proceeding slowly, in large part due to space issues.
<br>Vazic said there was not enough space to handle the 11
<br>ongoing war crimes trials and 25 ongoing investigations.
<br>(Note: The war crimes court, built with USG technical and
<br>financial support, has only three courtrooms equipped for
<br>multi-defendant trials and only two courtrooms for
<br>investigative interviews, and it shares this space with the
<br>Corruption Special Court. The courtrooms operate in two
<br>shifts, but each case can be heard only threeto four days per
<br>month.) Vukcevic told us he was proud he had made
<br>significant progress in 2008 on several cases that had
<br>previously been moving slowly, including the Zvornik, Lovas,
<br>Bytyqi Brothers, Suva Reka, and Ovcara cases.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶13. (S) We welcome the shift in the government's message that
<br>ICTY cooperation will not only bring economic rewards --
<br>which opinion polls show to be the biggest concern of Serbian
<br>citizens -- but is also a moral obligation. The new
<br>government at least is talking about shared values with the
<br>West and being a good neighbor. Having gone to great lengths
<br>to demonstrate its will to capture and hand over the
<br>remaining fugitives, the Serbian government now needs to
<br>deliver. There is a window of opportunity of high
<br>expectations. If Serbia wishes to reap the rewards of
<br>European integration and truly move beyond its painful past,
<br>now is the time to make the final push in seeking out and
<br>capturing these fugitives. Whether for pragmatic or more
<br>elevated reasons, we now believe the government will do its
<br>utmost to bring in Mladic and Hadzic. End Comment.
