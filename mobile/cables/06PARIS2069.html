<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: POLITICAL MINISTER-COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT, FOR REAS 
<br>ONS 1.4 B/D 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: Jean-Francois Ricard, terrorism investigating 
<br>judge for 12 years and deputy to renowned investigating judge 
<br>Jean-Louis Bruguiere, is being promoted and transferred to 
<br>the Ministry of Defense to work as chief magistrate for 
<br>military penal affairs. Speculation abounds that Ricard is 
<br>being groomed to replace Bruguiere, who is nearing the 
<br>mandatory French civil service retirement age of 65. In a 
<br>March 28 meeting with poloff, Ricard discussed a range of C/T 
<br>issues, including the "jihadists to Iraq" investigation, the 
<br>Christian Ganczarski case and the conclusion of the ex-GTMO 
<br>detainees investigation. End summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br>CHANGES AMONG THE TERRORISM INVESTIGATING JUDGES 
<br>--------------------------------------------- --- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Ricard described his new position at the Ministry of 
<br>Defense as advisor on military jurisprudence and informal 
<br>advisor on C/T matters to Defense Minister Alliot-Marie, with 
<br>the title of "magistrate general." He also plans on 
<br>continuing in an informal advisory role with the terrorism 
<br>section of the Paris Prosecutor's office. Ricard said it was 
<br>possible he would return in two to three years to take 
<br>Bruguiere's position. Leaving for a higher-level position, 
<br>as is the case for his new job at the Ministry of Defense, is 
<br>a prerequisite to being eligible for Bruguiere's job. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) When asked whether his replacement would be one of the 
<br>recently hired terrorism investigating judges, Ricard said 
<br>no. His replacement would likely be someone more senior who 
<br>already has the confidence of the DST, RG and DGSE 
<br>intelligence agencies. Ricard explained that the specificity 
<br>of a veteran terrorism judge like himself or Bruguiere is 
<br>that they are shown all manner of raw intelligence, even that 
<br>which can never be included in judicial investigations. 
<br>Being trusted by the intelligence agencies with this type of 
<br>information is a slow process, said Ricard. As an example, 
<br>he said it was only after five years as a terrorism 
<br>investigating judge that the intelligence agencies allowed 
<br>him to see the full scope of raw intelligence. Of all the 
<br>terrorism investigating judges in the Paris Prosecutor's 
<br>office, only he and Bruguiere are given this latitude, said 
<br>Ricard. Relationships within the French intelligence and C/T 
<br>world evolve slowly. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Ricard confirmed that Bruguiere was seeking a position 
<br>in a future Sarkozy administration, either as Minister of 
<br>Interior or deputy Minister of Interior. Traditionally, such 
<br>positions are given to elected officials (with the notable 
<br>exception of current PM Villepin), and therefore Bruguiere 
<br>will likely run as a UMP candidate for deputy in the third 
<br>district of Lot-et-Garonne (southwest France) in the June 
<br>2007 legislative elections (ref B). 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>"JIHADISTS TO IRAQ" 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Ricard said the open-ended dossier on "jihadists to 
<br>Iraq" continued to dominate the workload of the terrorism 
<br>investigating judges. Within the dossier are four separate 
<br>investigations, and interest among French Islamic radicals in 
<br>fighting "jihad" in Iraq continues. Recently, Ricard said he 
<br>had questioned a suspect in one of the investigations who had 
<br>converted to Islam in prison, and upon his release, was 
<br>focused on leaving for Iraq. Iraq has begun to overshadow 
<br>the Israel-Palestinian conflict as the obsession for many 
<br>Muslim prisoners, said Ricard. 
<br>
<br>----------------- 
<br>EX-GTMO DETAINEES 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Ricard confirmed that the investigation of the six 
<br>ex-GTMO detainees was finished, and the Paris Prosecutor will 
<br>likely charge all of them with "terrorism conspiracy." 
<br>Although the maximum prison term is ten years, Ricard did not 
<br>believe that any of the six would be given the maximum. The 
<br>investigating judges had successfully kept the Guantanamo 
<br>issue out of the actual case files, but it would be 
<br>impossible for the judges issuing the sentences not to take 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00002069 002.2 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>into account the detainees' previous imprisonment at 
<br>Guantanamo, said Ricard. He considered only two of the 
<br>detainees - Khaled Ben Mustafa and Redouane Khalid - to be 
<br>serious threats. Ricard added that he and Bruguiere had 
<br>fought to keep Ben Mustafa and Khalid imprisoned, but the 
<br>length of their pretrial detention, coupled with their 
<br>detention at Guantanamo, had swayed the "liberty and 
<br>detention" judge to release them on bail. The trial of the 
<br>six ex-GTMO detainees should begin in mid-May, said Ricard. 
<br>Only one detainee, Brahim Yadel, is still in prison. 
<br>
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>THE INVESTIGATION OF CHRISTIAN GANCZARSKI 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) German convert Christian Ganczarski and Moroccan 
<br>national Karim Mehdi were arrested in 2003 and since then 
<br>have been in French custody under suspicion of having ties 
<br>with al-Qaeda. Their investigation continues, but Ricard 
<br>said he is convinced that Ganczarski was aware of the 
<br>planning for the 9/11 attacks. He mentioned a video he had 
<br>seen showing Osama bin Laden lecturing, Ganczarski listening 
<br>to bin Laden in the front row and Mohammed Atta, one of the 
<br>9/11 hijackers, right behind him. Ganczarski refuses to talk 
<br>at all, said Ricard. "In another time, he would've been an 
<br>SS general," Ricard added. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>TUNISIA, GICM AND LIBYA 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) In other updates, Ricard said intelligence-sharing 
<br>relationships recently had become strained between Tunisia 
<br>and France. The strain originated on the Tunisian side, said 
<br>Ricard, and he assumed that it was due to political 
<br>calculations. (Comment: Since a FM Douste-Blazy visit to 
<br>Tunis last fall, the GOF has become more outspoken on human 
<br>rights in Tunisia, though still much less so than the U.S. 
<br>End comment.) Regarding the Moroccan terrorist group GICM, 
<br>Ricard said investigations into a GICM cell discovered in 
<br>2005 were wrapping up, and he expected those arrested to go 
<br>to trial in September. Finally, the GOF had picked up some 
<br>signs that small terrorist groups made up of individuals from 
<br>North Africa are quietly using Libya as a training base, said 
<br>Ricard. He speculated that the Libyan intelligence services 
<br>are generally aware of this and working to disrupt them, but 
<br>said it would likely be difficult to do so given that the 
<br>groups are very small. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Tripoli minimize considered.
