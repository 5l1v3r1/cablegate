<br>SUBJECT: (C) AFGHAN COMMERCE MINISTER DISCUSSES REFORM AGENDA
<br>
<br>Classified by Coordinating Director for Development and Economic
<br>Affairs Ambassador E. Anthony Wayne for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (C//NF) SUMMARY: Reform-minded Afghan Commerce Minister Shahrani,
<br>who hopes for U.S. support to keep a ministerial job, argued on
<br>November 15 that President Karzai is under heavy pressure from Afghan
<br>politicians to accept less than ideal ministers and urged that the US
<br>and other donors talk not only to Karzai but also to those
<br>politicians to stress the importance of approving a good slate.
<br>Sharani also shared his view of reforms needed in the new government,
<br>insights into fighting corruption, views on the importance of getting
<br>sub-national governance right, and the need for the government and
<br>donors to agree on specific performance benchmarks tied to aid
<br>delivery.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C//NF) Afghan Commerce Minister Shahrani told Coordinating
<br>Director for Development and Economic Affairs Wayne on November 15
<br>that President Karzai is under great pressure from political leaders
<br>to accept a number of ministerial candidates whose technical skills
<br>are lacking.  He specifically cited pressure from ex-warlord General
<br>Dostum, from ex-jihadist Professor Sayyaf and Hazara leader Mohaqqeq.
<br>Shahrani, who wants U.S. support to stay on in the cabinet,
<br>expressed concern that Karzai would not resist the pressure for
<br>political payback on his own, and urged the U.S. and other donors to
<br>communicate directly with these political groupings to indicate that
<br>if a weak or corrupt set of ministers was put in place then the U.S.
<br>and others would be forced to withdraw their support. He argued that
<br>these political leaders are only thinking of dividing up the spoils
<br>rather than the quality of government needed to tackle Afghanistan's
<br>problems.  Shahrani repeatedly argued that the next five years are
<br>essential for Afghanistan and the first months of the new Karzai
<br>administration are key to getting the right reforms in place to
<br>really bring about positive change in the years ahead.  Afghanistan
<br>needs the U.S. and other donors to have a chance for real progress,
<br>he said.  He urged that the U.S. speak frankly in private to Karzai
<br>as well as key Afghan political leaders.
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Shahrani argued that it is essential that the U.S. and other
<br>international donors get as many specific commitments as possible
<br>from Karzai, in the inaugural speech if possible and subsequently
<br>then in some sort of joint document between donors and Afghanistan.
<br>A key step is to press for the President to be clear on basic
<br>commitments in his inaugural speech, especially about good governance
<br>and fighting corruption.  Shahrani said he hoped the President would
<br>approve up to ten key areas for reform in the first year of his
<br>administration. He and Finance Minister Zakhilwal agree, according to
<br>Sharani, that the reform areas should be in areas where the
<br>population will see a difference in delivery of services.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C//NF) Shahrani underscored the need for very good ministerial
<br>and gubernatorial appointments and the concomitant reform of
<br>government organizations.  He said that he and other reform-minded
<br>ministers still believe they have Karzai's support to name lead
<br>ministers for five key clusters: 1) finance, economy and commerce; 2)
<br>agriculture and rural Development; 3) human development (education
<br>and health); 4) security; and 5) justice/rule of law. Cleaning up the
<br>last sector will be essential, he argued, especially given the degree
<br>of corruption currently in the Attorney General's ministry and the
<br>judicial system.  If this does not happen, it will be very hard to
<br>address corruption in the rest of the government.  Similarly, the
<br>executive office of the President needs serious reorganization so the
<br>President gets a good and balanced flow of information and advice and
<br>so that ministerial coordination and cabinet decision-making can be
<br>significantly enhanced, Sharani said. (Note: This is a complaint we
<br>have heard from a wide variety of sources, from donor nations to
<br>Palace insiders.  End note.)
<br>
<br>¶5. (C//NF) Turning to corruption more broadly, Shahrani argued that
<br>State-owned enterprises need to be turned into independent commercial
<br>entities rapidly (on the way to privatization), as they are great
<br>sources of corruption.  Shahrani also singled out the Transportation
<br>Ministry as a hot bed of corruption, especially its airport
<br>operations and its "private enterprise group."  Finance Minister
<br>Zakhilwal had recently broken up a corruption ring at Kabul Airport,
<br>but the private sector group is an even bigger problem.  This unit
<br>includes people who collect fees on trucks traveling in Afghanistan.
<br>Estimates are that about $200 million are collected yearly but only
<br>$30 million are turned over to the government, he said.  Individuals
<br>pay up to $250,000 for the post heading this office in Herat, for
<br>example, and end up owning beautiful mansions as well as making
<br>lucrative political donations.  This ministry should be a top target
<br>for cleaning up in the new regime.
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) In his November 15 conversation with Ambassador Wayne,
<br>Shahrani said, 14 of Afghanistan's governors have been identified by
<br>Local Governance minister Popal as bad performers and/or corrupt.
<br>These 14 should be fired, and the new government should implement
<br>procedures for selecting governors based on merit and for reviewing
<br>performance on a yearly basis.  Such a performance review process
<br>should be put in place for all top officials. There must also be a
<br>greater focus on improving service delivery at the provincial level,
<br>he argued.  Governors should be given more substantial operational
<br>budgets as well as placed under more rigorous auditing controls.  The
<br>big municipalities also need careful attention, first in good mayoral
<br>appointments and then in greatly improved management, tax collection
<br>and service delivery.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C//NF) Turning to international assistance, Shahrani argued that
<br>donors should tie additional aid to clear benchmarks and timelines.
<br>This should be publically announced as part of a broader agreement,
<br>and donors should be tough in demanding agreed performance benchmarks
<br>before distributing additional assistance.  Such an agreement should
<br>call for some overarching commitments, with each ministry receiving
<br>aid committed to achieving its own set of benchmarks in consultations
<br>with donors.  There should be focus on improving delivery of services
<br>to the population and mechanisms should be put in place to measure
<br>success.  Shahrani suggested that the action plans for ministries
<br>should have three to four year time horizons.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C//NF) Comment: Minister Shahrani is working closely with the
<br>Ministers of Finance, Agriculture, Education and local government to
<br>encourage bold reform moves by the new Karzai administration.  While
<br>some of the specific ideas he shared may be his own, they are
<br>consistent with what other reform-minded ministers have been saying
<br>and urging. Shahrani clearly hopes for U.S. support in keeping a
<br>cabinet position.  He has been a good partner on a range of
<br>commercial and economic issues and an energetic proponent of reaching
<br>a trade agreement with Pakistan.  He has also gone out of his way to
<br>help on bilateral issues such as finalizing arrangements for U.S.
<br>Consulate leases.
