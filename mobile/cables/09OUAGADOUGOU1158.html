<br>SUBJ: GUINEA - U.S./French Meeting with President Compaore 
<br>
<br>Classified by Charge d'Affaires Dennis Hankins for reasons 1.4 (b and 
<br>d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: AF DAS Fitzgerald and French MFA Africa Advisor 
<br>Montel urged President Compaore to take advantage of the window of 
<br>opportunity provided by the assassination attempt against CNDD leader 
<br>Moussa Dadis Camara. The U.S. and France emphasized that acting CNDD 
<br>leader General Sekouba Konate offered the only real hope for a 
<br>political transition that could meet all parties' concerns and allow 
<br>for a real democratic transition. Compaore agreed that the 
<br>assassination attempt had dramatically changed the situation but said 
<br>he would have to meet Konate personally this week to determine if he 
<br>was willing and able to accept the leadership role. If so, Compaore 
<br>is prepared to ask Morocco to have Dadis stay and to tell Dadis there 
<br>was no point in going back to Guinea. End Summary 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) AF DAS William Fitzgerald and Foreign Minister Kouchner's 
<br>Africa Advisor Charlotte Montel met with Burkinabe President Blaise 
<br>Compaore on December 14 -- the day following the Ouagadougou meeting 
<br>of the International Contact Group for Guinea (reported SEPTEL). 
<br>Charge and French DCM attended as note takers. Compaore was joined 
<br>by Foreign Minister Bedouma Alain Yoda. Compaore said he had wanted 
<br>to meet with the two delegations given the important role the U.S. 
<br>and France are playing in the Guinea crisis. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) DAS Fitzgerald assured President Compaore that the U.S. and 
<br>France support his mediation efforts but voiced a shared concern that 
<br>there was a window of opportunity available now because of Dadis' 
<br>absence from Conakry that will be lost if something is not done 
<br>before Dadis tries to return from Morocco. Fitzgerald noted the risk 
<br>of reprisals should Dadis be allowed to return. Montel, noting the 
<br>frequent discussions about Guinea between Foreign Minister Kouchner 
<br>and Secretary Clinton and the unity of vision between the two 
<br>capitals, emphasized the deterioration of the situation and our 
<br>belief that Konate could be a viable and acceptable alternative to 
<br>Dadis through a democratic transition period. Recognizing that 
<br>Konate suggests he is "tired" and not interested in the leadership, 
<br>Montel called for a "dynamic" to get him to accept and to keep Dadis 
<br>out. Fitzgerald noted that the Forces Vives had clearly stated their 
<br>willingness the day earlier to work with Konate but, given the last 
<br>minute change in the CNDD delegation that put pro-Dadis hardliners in 
<br>charge, were unsure whether Konate had authority. Montel emphasized 
<br>that Konate would be hampered by a lack of control posed by pro-Dadis 
<br>troops "as long as the fiction of his return" remains. If Dadis 
<br>could be kept out, she felt Konate would be able to maintain order 
<br>through the transition. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Compaore shared his view of the current situation and of his 
<br>strategy. His approach has been admittedly "prudent" given the risk 
<br>of escalated violence inherent in Guinea's fractured and 
<br>undisciplined military. "This is not a normal army where one general 
<br>is replaced by another. Each has his own troops loyal to him and now 
<br>we see the creation of militia as well." His original negotiating 
<br>paper did not specifically call for Dadis to step down since that was 
<br>likely only to provoke violence. He asesses Konate as someone who 
<br>would be the "ideal" solution for the crisis saying that, in his 
<br>previous encounters, he had seen someone who did not seek power. 
<br>That said, he is not sure Konate is politically willing or physically 
<br>able to displace Dadis through the transition. He will try to meet 
<br>with Konate in Conakry within the next few days to see if Konate is 
<br>up for the job. If not, pursuing this "ideal" solution is fruitless 
<br>and likely to provoke violence. If so, he is prepared to urge 
<br>Morocco to keep Dadis in Morocco and tell Dadis there is no hope for 
<br>him to gain any legitimacy. Compaore saw Dadis as a clearly unstable 
<br>element but, if Konate will not take the leadership, he sees the 
<br>continued need for a "Plan B" that accepts Dadis in some minimized 
<br>role but does not exclude him. In that vein, he continues to work on 
<br>a second draft of his mediation paper that establishes the artifice 
<br>of the "Council of the Republic" -- a collective body performing the 
<br>role of head of state but not head of government. Dadis could be 
<br>subsumed in this body while Konate might serve as the executive 
<br>agent. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Compaore directed the Foreign Minister to share the current 
<br>draft with the U.S. and France. That document (e-mailed to 
<br>Department, Embassies Conakry, London and Paris, and USAU) does not 
<br>make reference to a "Council of the Republic." Instead, it presents 
<br>an amalgam of entities that apparently aim to diffuse power. It 
<br>includes: a "National Transition Council" -- a 150 person body 
<br>representing "the components of Guinean society" headed by a 
<br>president coming from the religious community who is selected by 
<br>consensus by the members of the National Transition Council; the 
<br>"Head of State of the Transition" coming from the security and 
<br>defense forces who names the Prime Minister; The "Government of 
<br>National Unity" directed by the Prime Minister (who shall come from 
<br>the Forces Vives). The document stipulates that legislative 
<br>elections should be held in May 2010 and presidential elections in 
<br>
<br>OUAGADOUGO 00001158 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>October 2010. The document makes no specific exclusions of 
<br>individuals wishing to run for president but stipulates "The members 
<br>of the National Transition Council, the members of the Government of 
<br>Transition, and the members of the defense and security forces must 
<br>resign at least four months prior to the election. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Comment: Compaore remains cautious to a fault in his 
<br>willingness to exploit Dadis' absence. He does, however, recognize 
<br>the opportunity and is certainly now engaged in sounding out Konate 
<br>as an alternative transition figure to Dadis who could be acceptable 
<br>to the Forces Vives and the international community. Compaore says 
<br>he already started talking with members of the CNDD to prepare them 
<br>for a transition without Dadis. Compaore is clearly aware of U.S. 
<br>and French interest and, according to the other delegations at the 
<br>ICG-G meeting, is hearing from ECOWAS, the AU and the UN that Konate 
<br>offers to one viable hope for a peaceful and consensual transition. 
<br>He still comes across as timid and reticent to push things too far, 
<br>too fast. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) DAS Fitzgerald cleared this cable. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Conakry Minimize Considered.
