<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: Embassy San Salvador warmly welcomes the March 8-9
<br>visit of Assistant Secretary of Defense Dr. Paul N. Stockton and
<br>Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Dr. Frank Mora. Your visit
<br>comes while the GOES is in the midst of combating a public security
<br>crisis of the first order. It also comes at a time when the ESAF
<br>has emerged as a major player in President Funes's anti-crime
<br>strategy and his efforts to pursue a center-left, generally
<br>pro-U.S. agenda. Your visit will help reinforce the U.S. policy of
<br>active engagement with the GOES, which strengthens the moderate,
<br>pragmatic elements in the current administration.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Summary, continued: Recent polls show President Mauricio
<br>Funes with an 80 percent approval rating and overwhelming public
<br>support for a strong bilateral relationship with the U.S. Funes
<br>has fostered strong ties with the U.S. and Brazil, though some in
<br>the FMLN have pushed him to strengthen ties with Venezuela and Cuba
<br>while de-emphasizing the U.S. relationship. President Funes'
<br>non-FMLN campaign support group, the Friends of Mauricio (now the
<br>Citizen Movement for Change), is largely in control of the economic
<br>apparatus of the government. Similarly, Defense is in the hands of
<br>a formerly-retired, recently-promoted military officer and Friend
<br>of Mauricio, Brigadier General David Munguia Payes. FMLN members
<br>control security, education, and intelligence elements of the GOES.
<br>Foreign policy is in the hands of a loyal FMLN member, but has thus
<br>far been characterized by pragmatism and outreach to the U.S.
<br>Combating violent crime and rejuvenating the economy are the GOES's
<br>top priorities, but the Funes administration has made little
<br>progress on either issue since taking office last June. End
<br>Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>Good Relations with U.S. Essential
<br>
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) On the day he was inaugurated, President Funes told
<br>Secretary of State Clinton that his government needs a good
<br>relationship with the United States. Three out of every ten
<br>Salvadorans live in the U.S. and those who remain at home are avid
<br>consumers of all manner of American products, media, and culture.
<br>Nearly half of all Salvadoran exports are to the U.S. Given
<br>transnational crime links to and from the U.S. via Central America,
<br>there are no serious alternatives to cooperation with U.S. law
<br>enforcement agencies. The Salvadoran military admires and trusts
<br>our armed forces, and naturally look to us for training, equipment,
<br>and mentoring. USAID and MCC are prominent actors in social and
<br>economic development and are held in high esteem by the GOES and
<br>the people of El Salvador. As a result, the Salvadoran public is
<br>among the most pro-American in the hemisphere. Even the hard-line
<br>FMLN recognize these points, if at the same time they do not forget
<br>our role in preventing them from seizing power with violence during
<br>the country's protracted and bloody civil war.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) There is a growing division between Funes and the party that
<br>brought him to power. Funes joined the FMLN at the end of the 2009
<br>presidential campaign. Throughout the campaign, he maintained a
<br>close group of pragmatic, non-FMLN advisors (the Friends of
<br>Mauricio), a fact which rankled some FMLN hard-liners. Since Funes
<br>took power, tensions between Funes's centrist camp and the far-left
<br>FMLN leadership have grown. Funes has publicly rebuked his own
<br>Vice President, FMLN hard-liner Salvador Sanchez Ceren, and other
<br>members of the FMLN for advocating policies that sharply depart
<br>from Funes's moderate reform strategy. The FMLN appears content to
<br>ride Funes' high approval numbers while applying pressure via
<br>street protests, radical rhetoric, high-profile travel to Havana
<br>and Caracas, and back-room legislative maneuvering. So far, the
<br>fragile pact between Funes and the FMLN remains intact, but the
<br>relationship is clearly strained.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The political right is in disarray, though there are signs
<br>that the worst of the post-election turmoil may be over. After
<br>losing the presidential elections in March 2009, (center-right)
<br>ARENA has seen 13 of its 32 legislative deputies leave the party,
<br>12 of them forming a new party, the Grand Alliance for National
<br>Unity (GANA). In December 2009, ARENA expelled former President
<br>Tony Saca (2004-2009) from the party for alleged involvement in
<br>GANA's rebellion. While collectively the right-of-center parties
<br>could control a majority in the Legislative Assembly, infighting
<br>
<br>SAN SALVAD 00000085 002 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>and opportunism have prevented them from uniting to mount an
<br>effective opposition to the FMLN's and President Funes's proposals.
<br>However, inter-party bickering on the right has died down in recent
<br>months, and recent conversations with ARENA leaders suggest the
<br>party is finally righting the ship after more than a year of
<br>internal confusion and passivity. If this rebound strategy works,
<br>a rejuvenated ARENA could serve as an important base of support for
<br>President Funes in his struggle with the far-left FMLN leadership.
<br>

<br>
<br>Military and Defense Update
<br>
<br>---------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Responding to public pressure to stem escalating rates of
<br>violent crime, in November 2009, President Funes deployed
<br>approximately 2,500 soldiers to occupy and control 28 of the most
<br>violent urban areas in the country. These forces supplement the
<br>1,700-2,000 troops already operating joint patrols with the
<br>National Civilian Police (PNC), meaning that about half of the
<br>Salvadoran Army's 10,000 soldiers are engaged in domestic law
<br>enforcement. Aside from natural disaster relief efforts, this is
<br>the largest domestic deployment of the ESAF since the end of the
<br>1980-92 civil war. While initially popular, a consensus has
<br>emerged that the added military presence has not significantly
<br>reduced violent crime.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Highlights of the bilateral military relationship include:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- Cooperation and training programs intended to maintain a rich
<br>military-to-military relationship in humanitarian
<br>assistance/disaster relief, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics,
<br>and peacekeeping operations.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- As a testament to the strength of the mil-mil relationship and
<br>the effectiveness of our training programs, El Salvador deployed
<br>troops to Iraq from August 2003 until early-2009 who were
<br>considered professional and competent by U.S. and coalition
<br>members.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- In November 2009, Southern Command helicopters, based in
<br>Honduras, ensured rapid and effective delivery of emergency (mostly
<br>USAID) supplies in the wake of tropical storm Ida.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- In June 2009, the USNS Comfort visit provided medical attention
<br>to nearly 20,000 people and two engineering projects to rural
<br>communities. Beyond-the-Horizons deployments are scheduled for
<br>2010 and 2011. In November 2009, the Chief of the Salvadoran Navy
<br>signed a letter of request for four high-speed maritime
<br>interceptors under the Enduring Friendship Program.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-- In April 2009, we renewed the agreement to operate a Cooperative
<br>Security Location (CSL) for another five years. The CSL is located
<br>at the military end of the international airport, and serves as a
<br>regional hub for counter-drug detection-and-monitoring flights.

<br>U.S. Priorities
<br>
<br>---------------
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Our work in El Salvador is focused on (1) promoting
<br>improved public security; (2) supporting stable, democratic
<br>governance; (3) broadening economic prosperity; and (4) investing
<br>in people.
<br>
<br>SAN SALVAD 00000085 003 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Although El Salvador has made remarkable progress since
<br>the 1992 Peace Accords, violent crime continues unabated. The
<br>Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), coupled with
<br>ongoing efforts to strengthen the police, expand crime prevention
<br>programs, and implement judicial reforms, aims to improve public
<br>security and the rule of law. On February 18, the Legislative
<br>Assembly passed a landmark wiretap law which will help authorities
<br>combat the growing problem of telephone extortions and assist
<br>investigations into a wide range of criminal activities. The
<br>significant USG commitment to improving regional security, as
<br>evidenced by the presence of the CSL and the International Law
<br>Enforcement Academy (ILEA), provides us with additional credibility
<br>with the Funes administration.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Promoting economic growth, spurring job creation, and
<br>encouraging investment are important near-term USG priorities.
<br>Funes's electoral victory had a great deal to do with public
<br>dissatisfaction over economic conditions in El Salvador. Funes
<br>inherited an economy already in recession and a fiscal deficit
<br>which severely limits what he can do to stimulate growth. The GOES
<br>expects to raise $190 million in new revenue with a tax reform
<br>passed in December 2009; however, many economists project far lower
<br>revenue growth. The private sector has criticized the tax reform
<br>as excessively complex and poorly timed given the economic
<br>downturn. Business leaders also complain the GOES has yet to
<br>detail regulations on how it will implement the new taxes.
<br>Redirecting loans from multilateral institutions from debt
<br>refinancing to budget assistance will provide some immediate fiscal
<br>relief. El Salvador's economic recovery will largely depend on the
<br>U.S. economy, the destination for about half of its exports and
<br>major source of remittances ($3.8 billion, or 18 percent of GNP, in
<br>2008). In the short run, the ($461 million) Millennium Challenge
<br>Corporation project will provide much-needed fiscal stimulus and
<br>new jobs, while CAFTA and our USAID assistance programs will help
<br>strengthen the foundations for future prosperity.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>The Way Ahead
<br>
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) Although the Salvadoran electorate granted President Funes
<br>a mandate for change, by all appearances the voters expect him to
<br>work with the country's dynamic private sector, and to maintain
<br>good relations with the United States. Despite continuing problems
<br>with crime and a weak economy, the public is pleased with Funes's
<br>work thus far - his approval rating is above 80 percent in recent
<br>polling. Tensions between Funes and the FMLN could undermine
<br>governability and potentially damage the bilateral relationship
<br>with the U.S. Meanwhile, transnational organized crime and violent
<br>street gang activity pose as serious threat to the stability of the
<br>country. Your visit will help reaffirm our commitment to assisting
<br>the GOES in combating this non-traditional national security threat
<br>while continuing our traditionally-strong military-to-military
<br>relationship.
