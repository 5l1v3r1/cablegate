<br>SUBJECT: SECSTATE LEGAL ADVISER ON WAR ON TERROR 
<br>
<br>Classified By: USEU POLOFF TODD HUIZINGA, FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Secstate Legal Adviser John Bellinger met 
<br>with a comprehensive array of EU interlocutors in Brussels on 
<br>February 7-8 to discuss U.S. views on the legal framework for 
<br>the war on terrorism. He stressed that U.S. decisions on how 
<br>to deal with an unprecedented global terrorist threat had 
<br>been made after serious consideration of all legal and 
<br>political options, and that European officials must publicly 
<br>underline U.S.-EU solidarity in the fight against terror. On 
<br>Guantanamo detainees and Al Qaeda, Bellinger argued that the 
<br>U.S. was and is acting in the context of a new form of 
<br>international armed conflict, and that therefore, while the 
<br>Geneva Conventions do not fit this new situation well, the 
<br>rules of war provide a more appropriate framework than 
<br>domestic criminal law. He discussed European concerns about 
<br>the treatment of detainees. Bellinger also argued that 
<br>rendition is a vital tool against terror. Finally, he urged 
<br>the EU not to support a Cuban resolution at the UN Human 
<br>Rights Commission on Guantanamo. The EU response to the 
<br>visit was for the most part extremely positive, with the 
<br>Legal Adviser of the Austrian EU presidency underlining that 
<br>"the fight against terror is our (shared) struggle." 
<br>Europeans, however, remain concerned about protection issues. 
<br>END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>COMPREHENSIVE SET OF MEETINGS 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) On February 7-8, Secretary of State Legal Adviser 
<br>John Bellinger met with a wide range of EU and member-state 
<br>officials, including Robert Cooper, Director-General for 
<br>Common Foreign and Security Policy at the EU Council 
<br>Secretariat; Jean-Claude Piris, the Director-General of the 
<br>
<br>SIPDIS 
<br>Legal Services of the EU Council Secretariat; Michel Petite, 
<br>Director-General of the Legal Services of the European 
<br>Commission; Jim Cloos, EU Council Secretariat Director for 
<br>Transatlantic Relations, Human Rights and UN; and Gijs de 
<br>Vries, EU Coordinator for the Fight Against Terrorism. The 
<br>visit was capped by a two-and-a-half-hour discussion with the 
<br>EU Legal Services Working Group (COJUR), comprising the MFA 
<br>Legal Advisers of the 25 EU member states, plus Commission 
<br>and Council Legal Services and Romanian and Bulgarian 
<br>observers. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>BASIC CONTEXT: UNPRECEDENTED GLOBAL CONFLICT 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Bellinger stressed that the situation in which the 
<br>U.S. and its allies find themselves is unprecedented -- faced 
<br>with thousands of Al Qaeda and associated terrorists around 
<br>the globe whose goal is to inflict mass casualties on 
<br>innocent civilians by any means possible. The legal 
<br>frameworks that are readily available, the Geneva Conventions 
<br>or domestic criminal law, do not fit this unprecedented 
<br>situation well. In this context, the USG has thought long 
<br>and hard about how best to prosecute the conflict thrust upon 
<br>it in a way that is politically and legally legitimate, and 
<br>the answer to the question of what the rules should be that 
<br>govern the war on terror is not an easy one. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>INTERNATIONAL ARMED CONFLICT WITH AL QAEDA 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) It is clear, Bellinger said, that the military 
<br>response against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan 
<br>following the September 11 attacks, an action covered by UNSC 
<br>Resolution 1373, is properly categorized as an international 
<br>armed conflict. The U.S. believes that the continuing 
<br>struggle against Al Qaeda remains a legal state of 
<br>international armed conflict. Al Qaeda has attacked, and 
<br>continues to attack, our ships, embassies, people, and 
<br>territory. Its leaders have explicitly declared war on us. 
<br>Therefore, the proper legal framework cannot be that of 
<br>domestic criminal law. Al Qaeda is not the same as domestic 
<br>European terrorist groups like the IRA or RAF because it is 
<br>global and operates outside the U.S. and across borders. It 
<br>is in effect a new manifestation on the battlefield, that of 
<br>"armies of terrorists." Conceptually, this is a military 
<br>conflict, not a police action to round up criminals. Most 
<br>detainees have been picked up by our armed forces on foreign 
<br>battlefields. Practically, these cases would be virtually 
<br>impossible for domestic courts to handle, since there are 
<br>rarely witnesses, statements, or forensic or documentary 
<br>evidence that would meet domestic standards. Accordingly, 
<br>the most appropriate framework would be the rules of 
<br>international armed conflict. 
<br>¶5. (SBU) It is important to note, Bellinger emphasized, the 
<br>distinction between the President's political statement that 
<br>we are part of a "war on terror" and the legal status of the 
<br>international armed conflict with Al Qaeda. When the 
<br>President speaks of the War on Terror after 9/11, he is 
<br>taking the position that we must all declare our opposition 
<br>to terrorism of any kind. The U.S. also believes, however, 
<br>that it has been and continues to be in a legal state of 
<br>armed conflict specifically with Al Qaeda. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>DETAINEES COVERED BY GENEVA CONVENTIONS? 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (SBU) Bellinger stressed that the current rules of 
<br>international armed conflict do not fit this unprecedented 
<br>situation very well. After 9/11, the U.S. carefully 
<br>considered whether and to what extent the Geneva Conventions 
<br>would apply. Article 2 of the Third Geneva Convention 
<br>declares that these conventions apply only between High 
<br>Contracting Parties. While Afghanistan was a High 
<br>Contracting Party, Al Qaeda is certainly not. In addition, 
<br>Article 4 dictates that a POW must be a soldier in a national 
<br>army, wear a uniform with marked insignia, carry arms openly, 
<br>and follow the laws and customs of war. Because the Taliban 
<br>did not meet any of these conditions, they are not covered as 
<br>POWs under the Geneva Conventions. Furthermore, Al Qaeda 
<br>members could not be considered "protected persons" under the 
<br>Fourth Geneva Convention. The Fourth Convention defines 
<br>"protected persons" as civilians caught up in a conflict. Al 
<br>Qaeda was not caught up in, but rather initiated, the 
<br>conflict. Bellinger noted that privileges are given to POWs 
<br>under the Geneva Conventions for following the laws of war, 
<br>which are intended to protect civilians from harm. Al Qaeda 
<br>and the Taliban completely disregard the rules of war and 
<br>intentionally target civilians. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) If not covered as POWs or protected persons, what, 
<br>then, is the status of Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants? 
<br>Bellinger asserted that there is a clear gap between these 
<br>terms, and that the gap is intentional. Article 5 of the 
<br>Fourth Geneva Convention, he notes, specifies that "spies and 
<br>saboteurs" are not granted rights and privileges under the 
<br>Geneva Conventions. This designation, "spies and saboteurs," 
<br>is the designation in the Geneva Conventions that most 
<br>closely describes Al Qaeda terrorists. Thus, though they are 
<br>combatants, they are best defined as unlawful combatants who 
<br>do not have a right to any protections under the Geneva 
<br>Conventions. Bellinger also explained that the term 
<br>&unlawful combatant8 is not a new term but rather has been 
<br>used for many years in treatises and military manuals to 
<br>describe those who engage in combat, but in an unlawful 
<br>manner. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) Bellinger added that the U.S. response to Al Qaeda 
<br>attacks does not make members of Al Qaeda legitimate 
<br>combatants under the Geneva Conventions. Al Qaeda does not 
<br>follow the laws of war, and the fact that the U.S. is 
<br>fighting back in no way renders unlawful combatants 
<br>legitimate under the very laws they do not respect. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>STANDARDS FOR TREATMENT OF DETAINEES 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) If the protections of the Geneva Conventions do not 
<br>apply, Bellinger said, there is the question of what rules 
<br>the U.S. is applying to detainees. Accordingly, to clarify 
<br>U.S. policy towards detainees President Bush issued a public 
<br>directive on February 7, 2002, titled "Humane Treatment of Al 
<br>Qaeda and Taliban Detainees." This directive orders that all 
<br>detainees under the control of the Armed Forces be treated 
<br>humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with 
<br>military necessity, consistent with the Geneva Conventions. 
<br>In addition, the U.S. remains bound by, and committed to, the 
<br>United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, 
<br>Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. This includes 
<br>Article 4, which prohibits torture, and Article 3, which 
<br>prohibits transfers of persons to countries where there is 
<br>substantial likelihood that they will be tortured. Article 3 
<br>is applied on a case-by-case basis. A country's poor record 
<br>on human rights will raise a red flag, but not necessarily 
<br>entail a prohibition against transferring a detainee to that 
<br>country. Instead, in each individual case the U.S. seeks 
<br>assurances that the person involved will not be tortured, and 
<br>a transfer is only allowed if those assurances are deemed 
<br>credible. Regarding Article 16 of the Convention Against 
<br>Torture, which prohibits cruel, inhuman, and degrading 
<br>treatment, the U.S. Senate expressed reservations during 
<br>ratification in 1995 because there was no definition of 
<br>"cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment" in the Convention. 
<br>The Senate's reservation dictated that the U.S. would tie 
<br>this provision to the prohibitions of cruel and unusual 
<br>treatment in the Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to 
<br>the U.S. Constitution. Because these constitutional 
<br>amendments apply only to U.S. citizens in territories under 
<br>U.S. jurisdiction, the Department of Justice interpreted the 
<br>Senate reservation to mean that Article 16 applies only 
<br>inside the United States. Nonetheless, as Secretary Rice 
<br>said in December, as a matter of policy the U.S will treat 
<br>detainees in a manner consistent with these standards. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) Bellinger described recent U.S. legislation further 
<br>codifying the standards applied towards detainees. The 
<br>Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, he explained, allows the 
<br>Armed Forces to use interrogation techniques listed in the 
<br>U.S. Army Field Manual. In addition, the McCain Amendment 
<br>codifies the prohibition of cruel, unusual and inhuman 
<br>treatment, as interpreted by the Senate in its reservation 
<br>concerning Article 16 of the Convention Against Torture, of 
<br>any detainee regardless of nationality or of where he is 
<br>being held. Also, the Graham-Levin Amendment allows 
<br>detainees to appeal the results of military commissions or 
<br>Combatant Status Review Tribunals (see para 12) to federal 
<br>courts, while limiting detainees' ability to file frivolous 
<br>habeas corpus suits in U.S. courts. Bellinger also explained 
<br>the President's signing statement, issued with his signature 
<br>of the McCain Amendment. Bellinger said the statement is in 
<br>keeping with customary presidential practice and does not 
<br>indicate any intention to ignore the law. Rather, the 
<br>statement explains how the President intends to interpret the 
<br>law consistent with the powers conferred upon him by the 
<br>Constitution. Bellinger pointed further to the public 
<br>statement released by the White House at the same time, which 
<br>demonstrates the President's commitment to upholding the 
<br>McCain Amendment. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>REGULAR REVIEW OF DETAINEE CASES 
<br>-------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Bellinger then raised some of the more troubling 
<br>questions. For example, according to the rules of 
<br>international armed conflict, a nation may hold detainees 
<br>until the end of the conflict, when they no longer pose a 
<br>threat. How long, however, will the war against Al Qaeda 
<br>last? Can detainees be held indefinitely? What if some are 
<br>innocent? The U.S. recognizes that these are troubling 
<br>questions, but does not believe such questions could justify 
<br>a decision not to detain people who represent a danger to 
<br>American citizens. To deal with this problem at Guantanamo, 
<br>the U.S. has created an annual Administrative Review Board 
<br>process to determine, for each individual detainee, whether 
<br>that detainee should still be considered as in a state of war 
<br>with the U.S. This process has resulted in the release of 
<br>180 detainees and the transfer to other countries of 76, 
<br>leaving approximately 500 detainees left in Guantanamo. Of 
<br>those released, at least a dozen people are known to have 
<br>gone back to fighting against the United States. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) The question has also been raised as to the 
<br>possible innocence of Guantanamo detainees. As the Geneva 
<br>Conventions dictate, if there is any doubt about whether or 
<br>not an individual is a POW, there must be an Article 5 
<br>tribunal. Since Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters clearly did 
<br>not meet the conditions necessary to be granted POW status, 
<br>the President decided that Article 5 tribunals were not 
<br>necessary. In 2004, however, Combatant Status Review 
<br>Tribunals (CSRTs) were mandated by the Supreme Court. The 
<br>CSRT process goes beyond the brief tribunals required by 
<br>Article 5, providing each individual detainee with a full 
<br>review. These CSRTs have resulted in the determination that 
<br>there was not enough information upon which to hold a further 
<br>38 detainees. 
<br>
<br>---------- 
<br>RENDITIONS 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶13. (SBU) Bellinger pointed out that renditions have been 
<br>used for decades to detain terrorists and criminals who 
<br>cannot be extradited or otherwise detained or brought to 
<br>justice. He stressed that the United States does not conduct 
<br>"extraordinary" renditions for the purpose of torturing 
<br>suspects or transferring them to countries in which they will 
<br>be tortured. There are many circumstances in which a 
<br>rendition might be the best option. In all cases, renditions 
<br>are conducted in a manner consistent with international 
<br>obligations and the sovereignty of other states. The U.S. 
<br>would expect that states cooperating in rendition activities 
<br>would also do so in a manner consistent with their domestic 
<br>law. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Bellinger sought to dispel allegations that 
<br>hundreds of people had been kidnapped from European streets. 
<br>He pointed out that there is no evidence for such 
<br>allegations, and that the United States respects the 
<br>sovereignty of European governments. On renditions, CIA 
<br>flights, and other intelligence operations, the U.S. will not 
<br>confirm or deny specific allegations, in order not to 
<br>compromise the confidentiality of intelligence operations as 
<br>such. Bellinger noted that denying five out of six such 
<br>allegations would in effect confirm the sixth. The U.S. 
<br>trusts that European governments will continue to follow the 
<br>same policy. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>GUANTANAMO AT UN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Some EU interlocutors expressed concern that some EU 
<br>member states would support a Cuban resolution against U.S. 
<br>actions in Guantanamo at the upcoming UN Human Rights 
<br>Commission, that might be modeled after a European Parliament 
<br>resolution on the subject. Bellinger warned that European 
<br>support for a Guanatanamo resolution would be a serious 
<br>setback to U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism, and give 
<br>the unacceptable impression that the EU was aligned with Cuba 
<br>against the U.S. EU Council Director-General for Common 
<br>Foreign and Security Policy, Robert Cooper, said some EU 
<br>member states might feel obliged to support the resolution 
<br>because they had agreed last year not to in return for U.S. 
<br>commitment to allow the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, 
<br>Manfred Novak, to visit Guantanamo; now, the U.S. had gone 
<br>back on that agreement. Bellinger explained that the U.S. 
<br>had invited Novak to visit, but that Novak had chosen 
<br>publicly to reject the U.S. offer (to visit under normal 
<br>conditions, but not to able to interview individual 
<br>detainees, as only the ICRC may do that). Cooper said the 
<br>EU, having cooperated with the U.S. in resisting Chinese 
<br>attempts to impose conditions on visits of Special 
<br>Rapporteurs, was having difficulty justifying the U.S. 
<br>attempts to impose conditions on Novak's Guantanamo visit. 
<br>Both sides agreed that the U.S. and EU needed to consult 
<br>further in order to avoid a train wreck at the Human Rights 
<br>Commission on this. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>EUROPEAN REACTIONS POSITIVE FOR U.S. 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) COMMENT: By and large, Bellinger's European 
<br>interlocutors responded very positively to his visit. Their 
<br>questions were many and varied, and all of the meetings were 
<br>marked by vigorous but constructive discussion. It is clear 
<br>that many Europeans continue to believe that Article 3 of the 
<br>Geneva Conventions can be applied to enemy combatants, and 
<br>still afford the United States the flexibility it seeks. It 
<br>is also apparent that lingering concerns (fed by negative 
<br>public perceptions) remain about the treatment of detainees, 
<br>and protection against wrongful detentions. Some governments 
<br>remain focused on renditions, and the possibility that there 
<br>will be negative revelations that impact on them directly. 
<br>
<br>¶17. That said, the visit was very helpful in beginning to 
<br>dispel European misunderstandings and misgivings about our 
<br>pursuit of the war on terror. Continued engagement on these 
<br>issues is critical in the coming months to persuade EU 
<br>governments to stand more firmly and publicly in the face of 
<br>their public's concerns and suspicion regarding Guantanamo, 
<br>renditions, and the legality of U.S. actions against Al 
<br>Qaeda. The Austrian Chair of the COJUR meeting, Ferdinand 
<br>Trauttmansdorf, concluded the meeting with the following 
<br>message: "We leave this discussion with the notion that 
<br>America is carefully considering these difficult questions in 
<br>good faith." He said also that the fight against terror was 
<br>a burden shared by the EU, and that the U.S. has as much of a 
<br>right to ask questions of the EU, as the EU does of the U.S. 
<br>On the upcoming Human Rights Commission, urgent consultations 
<br>with the EU will be necessary to avert the possibility of EU 
<br>support for a Cuban Guantanamo resolution. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (U) This message has been cleared by Legal Adviser John 
<br>Bellinger.
