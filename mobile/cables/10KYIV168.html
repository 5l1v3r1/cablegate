<br>¶B. KYIV 0128 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador John F. Tefft, Reason 1.4 (b,d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. In contrast to the 2004 elections, issues of
<br>national security and defense remain notable by their absence
<br>in this year's presidential campaign. Ukrainians are focused
<br>on the economic crisis and the election's potential for
<br>reconfiguring Ukraine's political power relationships. All
<br>candidates have supported a transition to a professional army
<br>and the abolition of compulsory military service, but it was
<br>not until the final days of the first round that opposition
<br>leader Yanukovich and Prime Minister Tymoshenko elaborated
<br>much detail in their positions. Several candidates said that
<br>traditional European security and political structures have
<br>exhausted their potential. Only third place finisher Tihipko
<br>and President Yushchenko regularly highlighted strategic and
<br>foreign policy issues in their public statements. Anatoliy
<br>Hrytsenko, a former Minister of Defense and head of the Rada
<br>Defense Committee, appeared in fatigues in his campaign
<br>posters, but his low-profile campaign hardly registered with
<br>voters. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Geopolitical and Security Issues Largely Absent
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Throughout the campaign period, candidates presented
<br>national security largely in terms of economic and social
<br>security. Matters of international security, defense and
<br>regional stability generally received only broad formulaic
<br>attention and generated little public debate. Political
<br>analysts with whom we spoke lamented the low profile of these
<br>issues.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Director of the xxxxx told us that, with the European and
<br>global security landscape in greater flux and uncertainty -
<br>including due to Russia's reassertion of its political
<br>ambitions and world view - attention of the candidates to
<br>defense and security concepts is critical. Yet "no one," she
<br>said, was talking about them, just at the moment when they
<br>matter most.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) xxxxx and xxxxx, Director of the xxxxx, each pointed
<br>out that Ukraine will not receive NATO or EU membership over
<br>the next 5-7 years or longer. However, the course of
<br>European security will be shaped during this period. Now is
<br>the time for Ukrainians to care, they assert. According to
<br>xxxxx (and backer
<br>of President Yushchenko), the problem is simple voter apathy
<br>toward anything other than the scandal-oriented political
<br>commentary and debate that has marked post-Orange Revolution
<br>Ukraine.
<br>
<br>Yanukovych
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Viktor Yanukovych's campaign, like Party of Regions'
<br>legislative agenda over the past few years, focused primarily
<br>on domestic social welfare and economic/business issues. His
<br>defense platform cited "defense reform", transition to a
<br>professional force and abolition of compulsory service,
<br>military right-sizing -- in line with Ukraine's "economic
<br>potential" rather than resulting from review or analysis of
<br>threats and opportunities -- and social benefits for military
<br>academy graduates.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Yanukovych pledges a non-aligned Ukraine -- a member
<br>of neither NATO nor the CSTO -- within a multipolar "new
<br>world order". In a private discussion with Ambassador Tefft,
<br>Yanukovych held open the prospect of continued military
<br>cooperation with NATO and spoke of cooperation with Ukraine's
<br>military industrial sector. In another conversation with
<br>Ambassador Tefft(ref A), Yanukovych spoke of resetting
<br>relations with Russia but continuing to build ties with
<br>Washington. Yanukovych has stated publicly (and privately to
<br>us) that the future of the Black Sea Fleet would be decided
<br>in a way that would satisfy both Ukrainian and Russian
<br>interests, while protecting Ukrainian economic interests.
<br>Yanukovych's advisors tell us he would be open to extending
<br>the Black Sea Fleet's lease in Sevastopol if Russia offered
<br>attractive terms, with substantially increased rent.
<br>
<br>Tymoshenko
<br>----------
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) Yuliya Tymoshenko's official campaign platform only
<br>went so far as to promise to cancel conscription, moving to a
<br>professional army based on contract "principles," and to
<br>
<br>Kyiv 00000168 002 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>allocate "sufficient material, equipment, and finances" to
<br>"strengthen (Ukraine's) combat power." Tymoshenko has
<br>subsequently claimed that the Armed Forces receive adequate
<br>funding. Her foreign policy views have focused on economic
<br>policy, achieving European living standards with EU
<br>membership to follow, with only a succinct note that there
<br>will be "friendly relations" with Russia and the CIS, and any
<br>collective security arrangements will be decided by
<br>referendum.
<br>
<br>¶8. (SBU) In summing up her positions with the press on the
<br>eve of elections January 14, Tymoshenko pledged that under
<br>her leadership Ukraine would join the EU in five years, and
<br>achieve an Association Agreement and Free Trade Agreement by
<br>the end of 2010. She also said that the future of the Black
<br>Sea Fleet "will be determined in strict accordance with the
<br>Ukrainian Constitution." She took a position categorically
<br>against recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as
<br>independent nations. Outside the context of campaign
<br>stumping, Tymoshenko has consistently emphasized the
<br>importance of Ukraine's participation in the EU's defense
<br>policy. With public support for NATO at only about 20
<br>percent, Tymoshenko largely avoided mention of NATO in the
<br>campaign.
<br>
<br>Serhiy Tihipko
<br>--------------
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Serhiy Tihipko is the come-from-behind candidate who
<br>moved into third place, garnering 13% of the vote on January
<br>¶17. Meeting with the Ambassador on January 21 (ref A),
<br>Tihipko said Ukrainian public opinion is not ready for NATO
<br>membership. He advocated vigorous MoD engagement with NATO
<br>and adoption of NATO standards, and said MoD should focus on
<br>improving its capacity "to the maximum", but political
<br>leaders should avoid talk of NATO membership.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Tihipko said that as long as the current leaders rule
<br>in Russia, NATO membership will be impossible for Ukraine.
<br>The Kremlin would unleash a fifth column and destabilize the
<br>country if membership were close. Tihipko's campaign rhetoric
<br>has been clear that Ukraine "should give up (its) intentions
<br>to become a NATO member" and "stop wasting (its) time trying
<br>to secure NATO membership."
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Throughout his campaign, Tihipko voiced a pragmatic
<br>approach to Urkainian foreign and security policy that
<br>emphasized a constructive role for the country based on its
<br>own national economic interests, and rejected existential
<br>debates about political allegiance to Europe or Russia. He
<br>used that perspective to advocate more clearly and frequently
<br>his vision of an independent Ukraine acting rationally and
<br>independently on the world stage than any other candidate,
<br>save Yushchenko.
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Tihipko sees a clear role for Ukraine's
<br>military-industrial complex in Ukraine's economic recovery
<br>and in creating the strong military he believes is needed "to
<br>protect the peace." Ukraine needs to win respect in its
<br>foreign policy, including a "reboot" of relations with Russia
<br>(to be achieved in particular through joint
<br>military-industrial projects). Ukraine requires a new
<br>military doctrine based on the "threats and realities of the
<br>modern world," and a professional army effectively trained at
<br>all levels with an effective reserve corps. Tihipko has
<br>strongly criticized Ukrainian deployment to ISAF, saying that
<br>Ukraine has "no use for this war." He has argued that "the
<br>U.S. and its allies are defeated" in Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>
<br>Lytvyn and Hrytsenko
<br>-----------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Some expected former Minister of Defense and head of
<br>the Rada Defense Committee Anatoliy Hrytsenko, after a series
<br>of campaign ads featuring himself in camouflage gear, to
<br>continue with his normally pro-NATO, pro-Western rhetoric.
<br>On the contrary, Hrytsenko's campaign was a low-profile
<br>grass-roots effort that focused on the economic and political
<br>issues more immediate to the electorate. Nevertheless,
<br>Hrytsenko's campaign materials made it clear that he believed
<br>Ukraine must be prepared to "go it alone" without NATO or the
<br>EU in the near term. In his post-election meeting with the
<br>Ambassador on January 22 (ref B), he predicted that
<br>cooperation with NATO would continue, but Ukraine would not
<br>be able to be a particularly effective partner.
<br>
<br>¶14. (SBU) Speaker of the Rada Volodymyr Lytvyn early on took
<br>the position that Ukraine should stop seeking NATO
<br>membership, as the issue divides the nation. Furthermore, he
<br>urged that the Russian Black Sea Fleet remain in Ukraine
<br>
<br>Kyiv 00000168 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>after 2017 as a guarantor of Ukrainian security. Neither
<br>candidate polled well with voters, however.
<br>
<br>The Importance of Military Technical Cooperation
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Prominent Ukrainian xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>argues that while security issues did not play a role
<br>in the election campaign, the candidates are keenly sensitive
<br>to the condition of and fading economic potential of
<br>Ukraine's aging military-industrial complex. In his view,
<br>Ukraine's strategic orientation will be most greatly
<br>influenced by offers of tangible cooperation in the aftermath
<br>of the elections, regardless of the ultimate winner. Russia,
<br>he said brings so much more to the table in terms of
<br>long-term deals, purchases, sales, technology transfer,
<br>compatibility and interoperability, and the ability to
<br>revitalize Ukraine's military-industrial complex. Practical
<br>ties are what will decide Ukraine's future allegiances. NATO
<br>is a theoretical concept, and all politicians have come to
<br>agree that Ukraine needs the capacity for independent
<br>defense.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Until the final days of the campaign, issues of
<br>foreign and security policy were rarely raised by the press
<br>or brought to the fore by the majority of the presidential
<br>candidates. Nonetheless, the 2010 election is likely to mark
<br>a shift in the country's longer-term strategic orientation
<br>from the path laid out by Yushchenko in 2005. To the extent
<br>that the candidates have commented on the strategic future
<br>for Ukraine, the emphasis has been on achieving some sort of
<br>balance that will be acceptable to Moscow.
