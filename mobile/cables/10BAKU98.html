<br>
<br>Classified By: xxxxx for Reasons 1.4 (b and
<br>d)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Baku Iran watcher met with xxxxx
<br>(strictly protect - see reftels).
<br>
<br>He who Got Slapped
<br>------------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) According to source, President Ahmedinejad surprised
<br>other SNSC members by taking a surprisingly liberal posture
<br>during a mid January post-Ashura meeting of the SNSC called
<br>to discuss next steps on dealing with opposition protests.
<br>Source said that Ahmedinejad claimed that "people feel
<br>suffocated," and mused that to defuse the situation it may be
<br>necessary to allow more personal and social freedoms,
<br>including more freedom of the press.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) According to source, Ahmedinejad's statements
<br>infuriated Revolutionary Guard Chief of Staff Mohammed Ali
<br>Jafari, who exclaimed "You are wrong! (In fact) it is YOU
<br>who created this mess! And now you say give more freedom to
<br>the press?!" Source said that Jafarli then slapped
<br>Ahmedinejad in the face, causing an uproar and an immediate
<br>call for a break in the meeting, which was never resumed.
<br>Source said that SNSC did not meet again for another two
<br>weeks, after Ayatollah Janati succesfully acted as a
<br>"peacemaker" between Jafarli and Ahmedinejad. Source added
<br>that the break in the SNSC meeting, but not the slap that
<br>caused it, has made its way on to some Iranian blogs.
<br>
<br>Sides Preparing for New Confrontations
<br>--------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) Meanwhile, source said, both sides are digging in for
<br>new confrontations, while various sub-groups maneuver. He
<br>stressed the importance of recent speeches by Karroubi and
<br>Khatami to the effect that Ahmedinejad will not be able
<br>finish his term, and that Supreme Leaders should not take
<br>partisan political sides. He stressed that "Karroubi chooses
<br>each word carefully," and aid the recent speeches reflect an
<br>ongoing effort to split Khameini from the Ahmedinejad group.
<br>Source described the overall political situation within and
<br>without the political elite as "getting worse and worse." xxxxx
<br>opined that this situation (of protests and instability)
<br>cannot be sustained indefinitely, and predicted that events
<br>are trending towards major developments and a new phases.
<br>Asked what Iran will likely look like over the next year, he
<br>responded "ask me after 22 Bahman (February 11)."
<br>
<br>Tudeh Acticsts Re-Emerging?
<br>--------------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Source (a former non-Marxist revolutionary activist)
<br>also asserted that the Iranian Tudeh (communist) party is
<br>reorganizing among factory and government workers, and
<br>intellectuals. He claimed that many former Tudeh
<br>sympathizers hold positions in the bureaucracy and elsewhere,
<br>and opined that many still privately support the movement.
<br>He mentioned one xxxxx organizer who
<br>has re-emerged behind the scenes of recent bus worker and
<br>other labor strikes.
