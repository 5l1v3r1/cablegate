<br>SUBJECT: FM KOUCHNER'S SEPT. 19-21 VISIT TO WASHINGTON
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Craig Stapleton for reasons 1.4 (B & D)
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) The Bernard Kouchner who arrives in Washington Sept.
<br>19 remains both an extremely popular French politician and
<br>one of the few of President Sarkozy's ministers who has
<br>retained a margin of independent authority. Kouchner, the
<br>most prominent of the Socialists who accepted positions in
<br>the Sarkozy government, continues to lead the polls as
<br>France's most popular political figure. (With a 69%
<br>favorable rating, he is well ahead of other ministers -- and
<br>even of Sarkozy himself, who comes in at 64%). At a time
<br>when other ministers have receded so deeply into Sarkozy's
<br>shadow as to become invisible, Kouchner remains very much in
<br>charge on a number of issues -- Darfur, Lebanon, and Kosovo,
<br>for example. While other Ministers are routinely
<br>contradicted by the President (including the Prime Minister,
<br>whom Sarkozy has referred to publicly as his "collaborator,"
<br>a fancy term in French for staffer), Kouchner's voice is
<br>strong and authoritative. That said, and despite the good
<br>personal rapport with Sarkozy, who admires him as a man of
<br>conviction and concrete accomplishment, Kouchner will not
<br>have an easy time managing his portfolio in the era of a
<br>hyperactive President who wants to be seen as in charge of
<br>everything. Kouchner's one stumble since assuming office --
<br>when his briefing to Parliament on the Government's
<br>engagement of Libya over the Bulgarian medics demonstrated
<br>near-perfect ignorance of the facts -- is not necessarily his
<br>last. Sarkozy and Kouchner appear to be fashioning a
<br>coherent foreign policy -- based on a realistic view of what
<br>France brings to the table, a less ideological approach to
<br>issues, greater pragmatism in achieving objectives, and less
<br>aversion to working closely with the U.S. The byword for
<br>France's re-positioning vis-a-vis the U.S. will continue to
<br>be "convergence, not alignment."
<br>
<br>APPARENT MIND-MELD WITH SARKOZY ON FUNDAMENTALS: THE
<br>TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP, IRAN
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) When Kouchner agreed to become Sarkozy's foreign
<br>minister, he knew he was signing up to work for a President
<br>who would favor more substantial transatlantic engagement and
<br>greater day-to-day cooperation -- including on the security
<br>dimension. It is an orientation he shares. Sarkozy's will
<br>clearly be the decisive voice on how far France is willing to
<br>go on a "reform of NATO and France's relationship with it,"
<br>as he put it in his major foreign policy speech of August 27.
<br>But we judge that Kouchner will not be the one applying the
<br>brakes, despite the Gaullist reflexes of many of the Quai's
<br>old hands. Kouchner, like Sarkozy, is ready to break the
<br>mold where he is convinced it serves France's interests as a
<br>medium-sized power that should maximize the twin advantages
<br>of a leading position in the EU and a close, cooperative
<br>relationship with the U.S. Both feel fully empowered to
<br>engineer change at the beginning of their respective terms,
<br>at a time when the opposition is weak, and the blowback from
<br>daring initiatives such as Kouchner's visit to Iraq has been
<br>minimal. While Sarkozy has very definitely set the direction
<br>and tone on Iran policy, and the Elysee is managing the
<br>outreach to Tehran, Kouchner is clearly comfortable with the
<br>hardening of the French line: Three weeks after Sarkozy
<br>publicly warned about the "catastrophic choice between an
<br>Iranian bomb and a bombing of Iran (terming only the first of
<br>these "unacceptable"), Kouchner publicly observed on Sunday
<br>that given Iran's behavior, "we must prepare for the worst,
<br>in other words, war," and called for EU sanctions against
<br>Tehran.
<br>
<br>THREE KOUCHNER ISSUES: LEBANON, IRAQ AND KOSOVO
<br>--------------------------------------------- --
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Even in comparison with the peripatetic Sarkozy,
<br>Kouchner has been no slouch. Since assuming office in on May
<br>19, he has made 19 visits abroad. He has personally
<br>associated himself with, and publicly taken the lead on,
<br>three issues in particular: Lebanon, Iraq and Kosovo.
<br>Arriving in Washington, he will be coming off his fourth
<br>visit to the Middle East. Active across the clutch of Middle
<br>East issues, he has taken headline-grabbing initiatives on
<br>Lebanon and Iraq. In both cases, he has sought to keep a
<br>distance from the U.S., while working to achieve shared
<br>objectives. On Lebanon, his efforts to facilitate dialogue
<br>across the entire political spectrum have brought him close
<br>to U.S. and Chirac-era red lines, and a more risk-averse
<br>
<br>PARIS 00003919 002 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>reading of what is politically possible in Beirut has led him
<br>to different tactical conclusions. However, remaining in
<br>synch with the U.S. remains a guiding principle of his
<br>Lebanon policy. Visiting Iraq, he announced France's return
<br>as an independent actor, not as reinforcement for the U.S.
<br>Declaring that the U.S. "has lost the war," on the one hand,
<br>he re-engages France in Iraq on the other, calling for
<br>greater EU and UN involvement in support of political
<br>reconciliation and institutional reconstruction that would
<br>permit gradual U.S. military disengagement. On Kosovo, the
<br>pattern has been similar. A distinct voice and tactical
<br>differences with the U.S. -- insisting on the need for the
<br>appearance of a credible negotiating process, including
<br>consideration of options other than independence -- are
<br>offset by a bottom-line requirement to work closely with the
<br>U.S. to achieve a common strategic objective.
<br>
<br>KEY POLICY ISSUES: WHERE THE FRENCH ARE COMING FROM
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------
<br>¶4. (C) We expect that, time permitting, Kouchner would want
<br>to address the range of Middle East issues, Darfur,
<br>Afghanistan, Kosovo, and NATO. Herein follows a snapshot of
<br>where the French are on these and other possible subjects of
<br>discussion, and where differences over policy or analysis
<br>lie. Among Kouchner's top priorities since taking office are
<br>Lebanon, Iraq, Israeli-Palestinian peace, and Iran.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Lebanon: Kouchner surprised many by his quick
<br>plunge into Lebanese politics, organizing a national
<br>reconciliation process designed to secure agreement on a new
<br>president and a new national government consistent with
<br>UNSCRs that preserve Lebanon's sovereignty and limit Syrian
<br>(and Iranian) influence. Our partnership with France over
<br>Lebanon remains a top priority for the French, but we have
<br>divergent views on the stakes involved (the French fear a
<br>return to civil war more than a rolling back of gains made
<br>over the past two years to limit Syrian interference) and on
<br>tactics (the French prefer to press the Lebanese to seek a
<br>candidate of "convergence" and are reluctant to give the lead
<br>to the March 14 majority). Kouchner in particular is wedded
<br>to a process that accords parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri a
<br>prominent role in reaching a solution, partly due to
<br>longstanding ties between the two men. He does not seem
<br>nave about Berri, but has been prepared to accord him a key
<br>role that we do not think is deserved. In his last visit to
<br>Beirut, Kouchner challenged Berri to enter into dialogue with
<br>March 14 without preconditions. A frank discussion of the
<br>limits of our continued partnership is needed as well as our
<br>different views of the stakes and tactics to employ. The
<br>French concede that the presidential election process will
<br>play out until late November, which argues for Washington and
<br>Paris to stay in close and constant contact as the various
<br>Lebanese factions seek to play us off against the other.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Israeli-Palestinian Peace: Kouchner's just-concluded
<br>visit to Israel, the West Bank, Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon
<br>gave him a chance to discuss our efforts at achieving
<br>progress on the Israeli/Palestinian negotiations and probe
<br>for a potential French role in our planned regional meeting
<br>in November. He will press for us to step up our efforts to
<br>ensure that Israel and the Palestinians are ready to present
<br>evidence of a concrete accord with tangible results rather
<br>than another declaration of principles. In addition to
<br>asking what role interested parties like France and the
<br>Quartet can play in the regional meeting (about whose details
<br>the French are impatiently waiting), Kouchner has publicly
<br>discussed a possible role for Syria in such a gathering.
<br>This seems to be an outgrowth of French policy on Lebanon,
<br>which includes offering Damascus a possible place at any
<br>regional meeting we would organize on Middle East peace, as
<br>well as a reopening of a bilateral dialogue with Paris in
<br>exchange for good behavior on Lebanon during the Lebanese
<br>presidential election period. Kouchner, who has publicly
<br>suggested an eventual visit to Damascus is possible if Syria
<br>behaves, will meet his Syrian counterpart in New York and
<br>probably hopes to have a clear message to deliver about
<br>possible Syrian participation in the November meeting (which
<br>Kouchner wants to back a week to accommodate the Lebanese
<br>presidential election).
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Iraq: Kouchner's trip to Iraq confirmed his
<br>reputation for the dramatic. While its paternity is
<br>uncertain, it was clearly something that Kouchner wanted to
<br>do and believed in -- and one which Sarkozy wholeheartedly
<br>
<br>PARIS 00003919 003 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>supported. Nevertheless, France has dramatically "turned the
<br>page" in its relationship with Baghdad, and Kouchner has made
<br>good on his intention to spur the EU to play a more prominent
<br>role in Iraqi reconstruction as part of what he hopes will be
<br>a strong multilateral effort with the UN in the lead. The
<br>French are still developing ideas, however, about what they
<br>might do bilaterally. Kouchner is deeply pessimistic about
<br>the Iraqi internal political situation but has not repeated
<br>his readiness to host a reconciliation process similar to the
<br>one he launched for Lebanon. Although he has repeatedly
<br>criticized U.S. military intervention to overthrow Saddam
<br>Hussein (whom he nevertheless said deserved to be overthrown)
<br>and subsequent policy (he most recently said the U.S. has
<br>already been defeated in Iraq), Kouchner believes a continued
<br>U.S. troop presence is vital to prevent the stark
<br>humanitarian situation becoming an all-out civil war. He
<br>advocates a phased withdrawal but only one accompanied by a
<br>rebuilt Iraqi army and police force.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Iran: The Presidency has taken the lead on French
<br>policy regarding Iran, but Kouchner has recently and most
<br>bluntly warned that the confrontation over Iran's nuclear
<br>program could lead to military action ("war," in his words,
<br>which have left some of his handlers fretting). He and
<br>others in the French government repeatedly stress that
<br>pressing ahead with ongoing diplomatic efforts (including a
<br>possible third round of UNSC sanctions) must be exhausted
<br>before any potentially "catastrophic" resort to force.
<br>Before seeing you, he will have met with Russian counterparts
<br>to explain France's tough line, including Paris, urging of
<br>other EU members to impose sanctions outside the UNSC if
<br>necessary. Indeed, France's public hard line seems to be
<br>causing others in the EU to rethink their reluctance to
<br>undertake such sanctions. Kouchner's ministry was involved
<br>in quiet Iranian efforts to open a new channel to France in
<br>the nave hope of splitting France from the P-5 1. He might
<br>raise an idea floated by one of his subordinates of a
<br>senior-level U.S./French channel that might include the UK to
<br>discuss possible U.S. military action.
<br>
<br>¶9. (SBU) Europe/European Security issues: Strengthening
<br>European security is an important Sarkozy priority. He
<br>consistently claims that a strong European Security and
<br>Defense Policy (ESDP) is "complementary" rather than
<br>"competitive" with NATO. In his first major foreign policy
<br>speech on August 27, Sarkozy urged EU nations to accept a
<br>larger share of defense spending to overcome the shortage of
<br>EU defense capabilities and cope with global security
<br>threats. He highlighted the imbalance in spending between EU
<br>nations, stating "we cannot carry on with four countries
<br>paying for security for all the rest." European Defense
<br>Agency figures indicate that Britain, France, Italy, and
<br>Germany account for 75% of EU defense expenditures; of these
<br>four, only Britain and France meet the NATO benchmark of 2%
<br>of GDP (NOTE: The latest French figures on defense spending
<br>vary between 1.96 and 2.42%, depending on whether the
<br>gendarmerie, a force to guarantee civil order, is included).
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) NATO/France: In one of his first acts as
<br>President, Sarkozy launched a defense white paper commission
<br>to review France,s defense and security priorities; one
<br>component of the report (expected in March 2008) is a review
<br>of France,s relationship with NATO. The defense white
<br>paper could set the stage for a re-integration into the NATO
<br>military command. The public debate over a deeper French
<br>role in the Alliance was launched this month when Defense
<br>Minister Morin gave a speech to defense sector experts in
<br>which he openly questioned customary French reticence about
<br>NATO. At the same time, our interlocutors have uniformly
<br>cautioned against raising expectations and warned that we
<br>should not expect to see any major policy shifts in the
<br>immediate future (likely not until the defense white paper is
<br>well under way). Many (including, significantly, Prime
<br>Minister Fillon) remain concerned that abrupt moves toward
<br>NATO could be controversial domestically, and argue that, at
<br>a minimum, ESDP needs to be strengthened in parallel.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) NATO/Afghanistan: France has approximately 1,000
<br>military personnel based in Kabul, Afghanistan (with
<br>additional personnel deployed in surrounding regions such as
<br>Tajikistan and the Indian Ocean). The GOF will beef up its
<br>training support to the Afghanistan National Army through
<br>deployment of 150 additional trainers for Operational
<br>
<br>PARIS 00003919 004 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>Mentoring and Liaison teams (OMLTs) by the end of this year.
<br>For air support, the French have moved three French Mirage
<br>planes from Dushanbe to Kandahar this month, with an
<br>additional three scheduled to transfer in October. The
<br>September 10 French-German summit reaffirmed plans by the two
<br>countries to support the German-led EU police training
<br>mission in Afghanistan, although bureaucratic delays, lack of
<br>funding and a change of personnel has delayed deployment of
<br>this mission. On July 30, SACEUR sent a letter officially
<br>requesting six medium lift helicopters to provide rotary-wing
<br>support in ISAF (to replace the U.S. helicopters which are
<br>scheduled to depart early 2008). This request is still under
<br>consideration by the GOF.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) NATO/Georgia: The GOF is ready to give a positive
<br>signal to Georgia at the NATO summit in Bucharest (April 2-4,
<br>2008), but it prefers that NATO offer "something less than
<br>membership." France is opposed to a Georgia Membership
<br>Action Plan (MAP) for several reasons, including: concern
<br>over creating additional tensions with Russia, a desire to
<br>define the territorial limits of NATO and worries over
<br>Georgia,s internal problems with separatist regions. The
<br>GOF notes that NATO membership should not create new lines of
<br>division and that territorial conflicts should be resolved
<br>prior to membership (i.e. NATO required that Hungary sign a
<br>border treaty with Romania prior to becoming a member);
<br>Georgia does not meet these criteria. Therefore, the GOF
<br>does not support the USG proposal to have the NAC visit
<br>Georgia at the same time as the Secretary General,s visit at
<br>the beginning of October. The GOF is considering whether
<br>NATO could define with Georgia a different kind of status and
<br>a different approach to security in their area, possibly
<br>combined with incentives including abolishing visa
<br>requirements with the EU. The GOF is convinced that Germany,
<br>no less than France, opposes NATO membership for Georgia.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) France-EU: President Sarkozy was instrumental in
<br>re-activating the moribund political reform process in the
<br>European Union with the June negotiation for a shortened
<br>"reform treaty" that will simplify some of the EU,s
<br>operating procedures, while side-stepping efforts towards
<br>deepened political integration that doomed the EU
<br>constitution in 2005. This "reform treaty" must be approved
<br>by the other EU members and could go through ratification
<br>over the course of 2008. The French will also take over the
<br>rotating EU presidency from July-December 2008 and they plan
<br>to focus on immigration, energy, the environment and European
<br>defense during their term. Sarkozy remains firmly opposed to
<br>EU enlargement to include Turkey. Nevertheless, he has
<br>agreed to allow negotiations to open on 30 of 35 chapters,
<br>all those compatible with both membership and association.
<br>He conditioned his position on EU support for a "Committee of
<br>Wise Men" to reflect "without taboos" on the broader
<br>questions about the European future: i.e. what is the
<br>European identity, what should the EU,s borders be, how to
<br>handle common issues, and how deep can political integration
<br>go. Sarkozy also promotes the formation of a looser
<br>"Mediterranean Union" to coordinate policies and relations
<br>with the broad spectrum of countries of the Mediterranean
<br>basin. Sarkozy's tactical softening on Turkey surely sits
<br>well with Kouchner who personally favors Turkey's joining the
<br>EU, something he has told us directly, and about which he has
<br>agreed to disagree with his President.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) France-Germany: Thus far, President Sarkozy appears
<br>to be keeping to the tradition of meeting regularly every
<br>couple of months with the German Chancellor. While the
<br>summit meeting in July with Merkel was reportedly more tense
<br>with disagreements over EADS and Sarkozy,s blunt criticism
<br>to German FinMin Steinbruck over EU monetary policy, our
<br>interlocutors reported that the two leaders reached general
<br>agreement on major issues at the most recent September 10
<br>meeting. The French public supports a strong French-German
<br>relationship and expects the two leaders to work together
<br>closely. This was reinforced when both leaders were heavily
<br>involved in reaching agreement on the shortened EU "reform
<br>treaty" in June, activating hopes of a reinvigorated
<br>"Franco-German" engine to lead the EU. In what the French
<br>saw as a major achievement of their Sept. 10 meeting, Merkel
<br>signed on to Sarkozy's proposal to convene a "Committee of
<br>Wise Men" to reflect on the EU,s future. Merkel requested,
<br>and Sarkozy agreed, that presentation of the report should be
<br>delayed until December 2009, so that it would not be
<br>presented during the 2008 French presidency as a "French
<br>
<br>PARIS 00003919 005 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>vision," and it would coincide with timing for the next
<br>European commission. Managing the relationship with Russia
<br>remains important for both France and Germany, with the GOF
<br>acknowledging that Germany faces a more acute challenge due
<br>to its closer proximity and greater energy dependence on
<br>Russia.
<br>
<br>¶15. (S/NF) Missile Defense: The GOF was very interested in
<br>the latest round of U.S. and Russian talks on missile defense
<br>in Paris on September 10, including progress on negotiations
<br>with Poland and the Czech Republic (NOTE: The next round of
<br>experts meetings is tentatively planned for early October
<br>prior to the meetings of Foreign and Defense Ministers in
<br>Moscow). The GOF also agrees that many of Russia,s
<br>objections to the planned system are politically driven,
<br>reflecting an outdated Russian view in which it sees itself
<br>as increasingly encircled by NATO.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) CFE: At a recent meeting with Quad European
<br>Political Directors, the French expressed support for the CFE
<br>regime and for moving forward towards ratification of the
<br>adapted CFE reaty. This included support for the current USG
<br>"parallel actions" plan and the U.S. proposal to turn Russian
<br>forces in Moldova and Transnistria into an international
<br>force with a Russian component, as long as the requirement of
<br>eliminating ammunition was maintained. However, the GOF is
<br>pessimistic that such efforts would succeed in keeping Russia
<br>in the CFE. French Political Director Gerard Araud recently
<br>informed us that he had been told in Moscow that the
<br>"decision is already taken" to suspend Russia's observation
<br>of CFE and he added that Kislyak had told him that no flank
<br>limits on Russia were acceptable because it was "humiliating"
<br>that they should have such limits on their own territory.
<br>The GOF supports the upcoming CFE Seminar in Berlin in early
<br>October as a chance to give the allies a chance to unify
<br>their positions and demonstrate solidarity for the U.S.
<br>parallel actions plan.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Kosovo: Kouchner is working actively to build
<br>consensus within the EU on recognition of an independent
<br>Kosovo after the December 10 Troika deadline. The GOF is
<br>reportedly optimistic about the possibility for consensus on
<br>recognition, but less so about the prospects for consensus on
<br>the legal basis for an ESDP mission in Kosovo. Since a new
<br>UNSCR would provide an agreed basis, France is still pursuing
<br>that possibility. Kosovo is on the agenda for Kouchner,s
<br>meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in Moscow on
<br>September 17-18, though we have been advised Kouchner will
<br>seek to gauge Russian flexibility, not make new proposals.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Russia: Kouchner will have discussed a full range
<br>of topics with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in their
<br>meetings in Moscow September 17-18. Generally, the GOF
<br>advocates an approach towards Russia that falls between
<br>"complacency and confrontation." While Chirac's insistence
<br>that the primacy of he Paris-Moscow relationship (in his
<br>multipolar world) was inconsistant with even private
<br>criticism of Russian behavior, either Sarkozy nor Kouchner
<br>have refrained from publicly pointing to official Russian
<br>"brutality" (Sarkozy's choice of words). That said,
<br>Kouchner's foreign ministry continues to remind us that
<br>France and the rest of Europe are a lot closer to Russia than
<br>we are, and that it holds an important energy card that many
<br>Europeans will ignore at their peril. In other words, France
<br>and Europe will have to continue to carefully manage Russia.
<br>They will seek, in particular, to avoid aggravating Moscow
<br>before the Dec. 10 Kosovo Troika deadline. France recognizes
<br>that Russian resistance to MD is politically-driven. While
<br>welcoming the U.S. "parallel actions" proposal on CFE, the
<br>GOF views prospects for keeping Russia in CFE as poor, and is
<br>focused on ensuring Allied unity. France agrees that NATO
<br>should send a positive signal to Georgia at the Bucharest
<br>summit; however, France is looking for options other than
<br>extending the MAP, due to Russia,s sensitivities but also
<br>France,s uncertainty about entering into an Article V
<br>commitment to Georgia.
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) Africa - Darfur: The Sarkozy government and
<br>Kouchner in particular, have taken a strong interest in
<br>African issues from the moment they took office. One of
<br>Kouchner's first acts was to call for and then host the June
<br>25 ministerial meeting on Darfur. France's efforts have
<br>played a positive role in energizing international action. A
<br>follow-up meeting on Darfur, to be hosted jointly by the UN
<br>
<br>PARIS 00003919 006 OF 006
<br>
<br>
<br>and AU, is to take place on September 21 on the margins of
<br>the UNGA, to be followed by a heads-of-state meeting of the
<br>UN Security Council on September 25, to address Africa more
<br>generally. The latter will be chaired by President Sarkozy
<br>(France being the UNSC President in September). The French
<br>have firmly supported the deployment of the hybrid UN-AU
<br>force in Darfur (UNAMID).
<br>
<br>¶20. (C) Africa - Chad: The French have also developed a
<br>plan to place a peacekeeping mission in Chad and the Central
<br>African Republic, which they see as sharing many of Darfur's
<br>problems that would protect refugee and IDPs. The mission
<br>would have a French-led EU military component and a UN civpol
<br>element. The French would like the UN Security Council to
<br>adopt a resolution approving such a mission (which is a legal
<br>necessity before the EU can go forward) prior to the
<br>September 25 heads-of-state UNSC meeting, with initial
<br>deployment to follow shortly thereafter. One stumbling block
<br>has been the issue of UN funding for Chadian gendarmes who
<br>would serve with the mission. The U.S. and France have been
<br>working to resolve this funding issue, which largely centers
<br>on UN financing rules.

<br>¶21. (C) Sarkozy,s vision for Africa: In a broader sense,
<br>President Sarkozy has signaled his own vision of Africa,
<br>notably in a speech he gave in Dakar, Senegal, shortly after
<br>taking office. The speech was both praised and criticized in
<br>France and in Africa -- on the one hand, it was quite frank
<br>in advising Africans that they would have to take more
<br>responsibility for their own situations and to avoid
<br>attributing all of their problems to colonialism. On the
<br>other hand, some observers found Sarkozy's tone condescending
<br>and paternalistic, i.e., a vestige of the very colonial
<br>attitude that he was suggesting that Africans needed to put
<br>behind them. On balance, however, the speech, perhaps
<br>intentionally provocative, signaled France's continuing
<br>strong interest in Africa but also a hope that Africa and its
<br>European partners could do business on a more pragmatic and
<br>less emotionally-charged basis than has been the case during
<br>much of the post-colonial period.
<br>
<br>¶22. (S) Colombia: In June of this year, the French pushed
<br>Colombian President Alvaro Uribe to release 200 FARC
<br>prisoners in an effort to move negotiations for the release
<br>of FARC hostages, namely Franco-Colombian Ingrid Betancourt,
<br>forward. While this prisoner release has not resulted in
<br>negotiations by the FARC, the French are now backing
<br>Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez,s offer to negotiate a
<br>hostage deal between the Colombian government and FARC
<br>guerrillas. President Sarkozy has spoken by phone to Chavez
<br>twice over the past few weeks and Chavez will most likely
<br>visit France in the coming months. That said, the French
<br>want to show they are doing everything they can to liberate
<br>Betancourt while publicly downplaying to the extent possible
<br>a role for Chavez. Ingrid Betancourt remains a major media
<br>personality in France and the GOF is under a great deal of
<br>political pressure to show the government "will leave no
<br>stone unturned." Sarkozy is likely aware that without a
<br>gesture from the FARC, the Colombians are unlikely to make
<br>any further concessions including prisoner releases.
<br>Kouchner recently met with Colombian Foreign Minister Araujo,
<br>and Sarkozy will meet with Colombian president Uribe on the
<br>margins of the UNGA on September 25. Betancourt is
<br>reportedly high on the bilateral agenda.
