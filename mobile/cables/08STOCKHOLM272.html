<br>SUBJECT: THREE ISSUES FOR MOD TOLGFORS APRIL 17 CALL ON
<br>SECDEF GATES
<br>
<br>REF: A. STATE 19616
<br>     ¶B. STOCKHOLM 187
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador M. Wood for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>¶1. (C) In connection the upcoming April 16-17 visit by
<br>Swedish Minister of Defense Sten Tolgfors to Washington,
<br>Embassy recommends raising two requests regarding specific
<br>additional contributions in Afghanistan (ref A) and Sweden's
<br>pending decision on participation in NATO's Rapid Response.
<br>We also recommend thanking Sweden for hosting the upcoming
<br>International Compact with Iraq Conference.  End Summary.
<br>
<br>Supporting ISAF in Afghanistan
<br>------------------------------
<br>¶2.  (C) We demarched MFA and MOD regarding ref A request for
<br>the Swedish Armed Forces to deploy a Battalion-level
<br>Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT) to Afghanistan
<br>(Ref B). Although Sweden has promised to continue and do more
<br>in Afghanistan, we have received no reply regarding the
<br>OMLT,s.   We recommend Secretary Gates raise the issue with
<br>Defense Minister Tolgfors at their April 17 meeting.
<br>
<br>¶3.  (C) For the battalion OMLT to be operationally effective
<br>would require a change in the current Swedish policy that
<br>decisions to deploy Swedish soldiers outside their PRT area
<br>be made in Stockholm, rather than in the field.  Our sources
<br>indicate no such deliberation is underway.  In addition, the
<br>Swedish Armed Forces has indicated its desire on several
<br>occasions to deploy Medevac helicopters, JAS-39 Gripen
<br>aircraft and possibly additional soldiers in its PRT.  The
<br>Ministers current views on these subjects would prove
<br>enlightening.
<br>
<br>NATO Rapid Response
<br>----------------------------
<br>¶4.  (C) Sweden,s MOD had earlier expressed an interest and
<br>the politicians are currently deliberating Sweden,s
<br>participation in the January-July 2010 NATO Response Force
<br>¶14.  We had hoped that, like Finland, Sweden would announce
<br>their commitment to the effort at the Bucharest Summit.  The
<br>decision was delayed by haggling within the governing
<br>center-right coalition (which is led by the Moderate Party,
<br>of which Tolgfors is a member).  The pivotal Center Party is
<br>hesitant, but a decision in favor of participati
<br>on has not been precluded.  The likely scope of Sweden,s potential
<br>contribution has not been declared, though the Swedish Armed
<br>Forces had said it would likely be a land component. Sweden
<br>currently leads and contributes 2300 personnel to an EU
<br>battle group with a core mechanized battalion, and intends to
<br>do this again in 2011.  There is however no reason to believe
<br>this level of effort would be offered for the NRF 14.  Sweden
<br>must fund, recruit and train and from a pool of former
<br>conscripts and reserve soldiers to field a force of this
<br>nature as it has limited standing forces for this task.
<br>
<br>
<br>International Compact With Iraq Conference (ICI)
<br>--------------------------------------------- ---------------
<br>¶5.  (C) On April 3, Prime Minister Fredrick Reinfeldt
<br>nannounced that Sweden will host the May 29 ICI conference on
<br>Iraq, co-chaired by UN SYG Ban and Iraq PM Maliki.  Secretary
<br>Rice will attend.  Reinfeldt stated what Sweden hopes to see
<br>is the groundwork for civilian missions that build a country
<br>in the long term, adding that Sweden plans to be very active.
<br> Likely Swedish contributions to Iraq rebuilding efforts are
<br>civilian and therefore largely outside the portfolio of
<br>Minister Tolgfors, but we recommend Secretary Gates thank
<br>Minister Tolgfors for the GoS hosting this conference.
<br>
<br>¶6.  (C) Bio comment:  The Ambassador has cultivated a close
<br>working relationship with Tolgfors from Tolgfors' prior job
<br>as Minister of Foreign Trade.  Tolgfors went to high school
<br>in the U.S. and told the Ambassador he loves the U.S. and
<br>maintains friends there.
