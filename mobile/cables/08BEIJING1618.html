<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Chinese authorities this past week have moved to 
<br>curtail anti-French and anti-Western demonstrations in China. 
<br>Official propaganda has tried to steer the public toward 
<br>more "rational" displays of patriotism, with security and 
<br>Party officials bluntly telling university students in 
<br>Beijing to halt all protests. (Note: One contact told us 
<br>the Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC) decided on April 18 
<br>to take steps to rein in the current wave of nationalism that 
<br>central authorities had, in part, been fanning. The next 
<br>day, official media began running stories calling for 
<br>"rational" patriotism.) Students appear to be taking heed, 
<br>though some have told us they remain frustrated and angry at 
<br>the West's "unfair" criticism of China's Tibet policies and 
<br>the humiliation of Olympic torch runners. "Patriotism" is 
<br>running high, our contacts say, but "destabilizing 
<br>nationalism" remains in check. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>Anti-French Protests 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Prior to this past week, anti-Western, especially 
<br>anti-French, sentiment had been on the rise in many parts of 
<br>China, as manifested by fiery on-line rhetoric among China's 
<br>netizens and demonstrations in a number of Chinese cities. 
<br>For example, demonstrators gathered outside locations of the 
<br>French supermarket giant Carrefour throughout China April 
<br>18-20. The protests started in part due to a widely held 
<br>belief (later denied by the company) that a major Carrefour 
<br>stockholder has provided financial aid to organizations 
<br>advocating Tibetan independence. France's "mishandling" of 
<br>the torch relay and French President Sarkozy's potential 
<br>"snubbing" of the Olympic opening ceremonies also fueled the 
<br>demonstrations. While largely peaceful, demonstrations in 
<br>some cities took a xenophobic and violent turn. In Zhuzhou, 
<br>Hunan Province, a mob reportedly attacked an American English 
<br>teacher, whom they apparently mistakenly assumed was French, 
<br>as he emerged from a Carrefour April 20. Other signs of 
<br>rising patriotic and anti-French sentiment included a photo 
<br>circulating on the Internet showing a taxi in Shandong 
<br>Province with a sign in the back window that reads, "Refuse 
<br>to carry Frenchmen and dogs." An Internet cartoon widely 
<br>circulated among Chinese youth via e-mail depicts a character 
<br>severely beating a would-be Carrefour shopper. On Saturday, 
<br>April 18, there were small demonstrations in Beijing front of 
<br>the French Embassy and a nearby French school. 
<br>
<br>"Patriotism Should Be Rational" 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) As the anti-French protests reached a peak over the 
<br>weekend of April 19-20, China's propaganda apparatus on April 
<br>19 began a campaign to calm public anger. According to 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX this new propaganda phase grew out of a
<br>decision made at an April 18 Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC)
<br>meeting.  According to XXXXXXXXXXXX , at the meeting, China's leadership
<br>decided  that the goal of utilizing the Chinese public to "protest 
<br>against and warn" Western countries had "already succeeded." 
<br>Therefore, before nationalist sentiment spun off in unwanted 
<br>directions domestically or led to a dramatic shift in Western 
<br>countries' attitudes toward China, the Center should move to 
<br>curb growing patriotic fervor. Prior to April 18, central 
<br>authorities had been deliberately fanning the flames of 
<br>nationalism, XXXXXXXXXXXX said, claiming that acquaintances in the 
<br>Party Propaganda Department had been posing as bloggers or 
<br>online commentators, purposefully posting rhetoric designed 
<br>to fuel anti-Western feelings, assisted by the official 
<br>media's exceptionally hard-line propaganda. Party Propaganda 
<br>Department head Liu Yunshan was reportedly directly behind 
<br>these policies. Now, however, the Center has decided to 
<br>"stop playing with fire," XXXXXXXXXXXX stated. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Following the April 19 Xinhua News Agency piece 
<br>calling for more "rational" expressions of nationalism, other 
<br>media pieces appeared emphasizing the same line while also 
<br>attempting to directly dampen anti-French sentiment. In a 
<br>story that ran in Chinese papers April 21, the Xinhua News 
<br>Agency reported denials by Carrefour's CEO that the company 
<br>supported Tibetan independence. The cover of the April 22 
<br>edition of Beijing News (Xinjing Bao) carried a photo of a 
<br>dormitory building at the Beijing Institute of Technology 
<br>with numerous Chinese flags flying outside the windows. The 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00001618 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>caption quotes school officials as saying that displaying the 
<br>flag is a "rational" (li xing) and "normal" expression of the 
<br>student's patriotism. On April 23, newspapers printed 
<br>another Xinhua story, this one quoting a Ministry of Commerce 
<br>official praising Carrefour for providing 40,000 jobs in 
<br>China, selling mostly Chinese products and supporting the 
<br>Beijing Games. 
<br>
<br>Students Told To Stop Anti-French Protests 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) This pro-Carrefour propaganda campaign, according to 
<br>our contacts, corresponded with more direct efforts by 
<br>security and Communist Party officials to stop university 
<br>students in Beijing from participating in further 
<br>demonstrations. XXXXXXXXXXXX, told PolOff that two
<br>Ministry  of State Security agents approached him
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX to demand  that the Institute cancel
<br>a public discussion on nationalism  scheduled to take plac
<br> the following day. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, 
<br>security forces had also "spoken with" at least XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>activists to warn them against any further  anti-Western activities.
<br>At XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff XXXXXXXXXXXX that
<br>the university's Communist Party  committee had likewise
<br>issued instructions to students to  cease all demonstrations. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, added that all class-level Party representatives 
<br>were enlisted to ensure the message reached the entire 
<br>student body. 
<br>
<br>"West Blindly Sympathetic Toward Dalai Lama" 
<br>-------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) While protests have subsided, students we spoke with 
<br>still expressed frustration at the West's reaction to events 
<br>in Tibet. XXXXXXXXXXXX. The students all said they were
<br>angered by  "biased" Western media reports of the March 14
<br>Lhasa riots,  singling CNN out for special criticism. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX told PolOff that she sensed in
<br>Western media  reporting a reflexive sympathy for Tibetans
<br>and a deliberate  downplaying of the violence ethnic Tibetan
<br>rioters in Lhasa  inflicted on innocent Han Chinese. France
<br>had become the  focus of nationalist anger, according to
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX  because Paris police seemed to favour
<br>the pro-Tibet  protestors and allowed them to attack the torch.
<br>While many  Chinese are angry with the United States for
<br>supporting the  Dalai Lama, they said, just as many appreciate 
<br>President  Bush's rejection of an Olympic boycott. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) While all the students acknowledged problems in Tibet, 
<br>especially the difficulty in ensuring that more Tibetans 
<br>benefit from China's economic growth, they accused the West 
<br>of ignoring the "real progress" China has made. While none 
<br>of the students has participated in the anti-French protests, 
<br>all said the unrest in Tibet and the disruptions of the 
<br>Olympic torch relay had made them feel more patriotic.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX added that her undergraduate classmates
<br>who are currently studying abroad have had the strongest
<br>reaction and  many have added patriotic slogans to their instant
<br>messaging  IDs. XXXXXXXXXXXX  and her classmates, however,
<br>cautioned against  exaggerating the long-term impact of the
<br> anti-French/ anti-West protests. While emotions are still
<br>running high XXXXXXXXXXXX said, "all of this will be
<br>forgotten  if the Games go well." 
<br>
<br>
<br>Singapore Media "Most Reliable" 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) While focusing most of their ire on Western media and 
<br>governments, the students also had harsh reviews of the 
<br>Chinese leadership. XXXXXXXXXXXX criticized the Chinese 
<br>Government's rhetoric on Tibet as "overly shrill" and 
<br>"ineffective" in swaying international opinion.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX said China's official press provided inadequate
<br>coverage of  the Lhasa riots and did not provide enough information
<br>to  counter the "biased" Western media reports. XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br> and other  students said that, in addition to Beijing University's 
<br>internal Internet bulletin board, they rely most heavily on 
<br>Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao newspaper for information on Tibet 
<br>and the torch relay. Singapore's media "understands" China 
<br>better than Western papers, they said, yet is not subject to 
<br>Chinese Government censorship. The same could not be said of 
<br>Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television, they told PolOff. Though 
<br>widely available on Beijing University's campus, Phoenix is 
<br>"too close to the Chinese Government" to be of much use. 
<br>
<br>"We Saved the Tibetans" 
<br>
<br>BEIJING 00001618 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Two twenty-something professionals, both of whom were 
<br>recently accepted into Duke University's MBA program, echoed 
<br>the frustrations of the Beijing University students in a 
<br>conversation with PolOff April 23. XXXXXXXXXXXX ,
<br>complained about  the "bias" of CNN. Westerners do not understand
<br>the "true story" about Tibet, Li asserted, adding that China "saved 
<br>Tibetans from slavery." XXXXXXXXXXX said his 
<br>generation is more "pro-establishment" than young people in 
<br>most other parts of the world. Members of China's "80s 
<br>generation," XXXXXXXXXXXX  added, have benefited greatly
<br>from China's  reforms and, though young, still remember the relative 
<br>poverty of the late 1980s and early 1990s. While this does 
<br>not mean all Chinese youth support the Communist Party, 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX explained, pride in China's recent
<br>accomplishments does make them rally around the flag when
<br>they see China criticized  abroad. XXXXXXXXXXXX, however,
<br>said China's Government has moved  quickly to limit the anti-French
<br>protests because it wants to  avoid a repeat of 2005, when
<br>anti-Japanese protests "got out  of control." 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX  said young Chinese tend to be 
<br>suspicious, even dismissive, of  government propaganda except
<br>when it comes to issues of  national unity. A lifetime of political
<br>indoctrination has conditioned Chinese of all ages to react
<br>emotionally to  perceived separatists threats, which makes China
<br>appear  irrational and thin-skinned to the outside world.
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX, however, noted positive differences between
<br>recent  anti-French demonstrations and the 2005 anti-Japanese 
<br>protests. First, he said, the number of actual demonstrators 
<br>outside Carrefour branches was very small. In most cases, 
<br>spectators greatly outnumbered the protestors. Second, in 
<br>contrast to previous nationalist incidents, there was a much 
<br>wider debate on the Internet about the appropriateness of 
<br>anti-Western protests. XXXXXXXXXXXX said he was struck
<br>by the large  number of Chinese netizens who voiced opposition
<br>to the  Carrefour boycott. He said this is a "positive sign" that 
<br>may indicate Chinese attitudes towards the outside world are 
<br>growing more mature. 
<br>
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Patriotic sentiment, especially among students, 
<br>appears sincere and on the rise, even though the Government 
<br>has clearly played a role in fanning such feelings. Chinese 
<br>Government efforts over the past week to put a lid on overt 
<br>nationalist demonstrations has so far been effective. The 
<br>message now emphasized by China's propaganda organs is that 
<br>holding a successful Olympics, not rash protests, is the best 
<br>answer to Western criticism. Our contacts quoted above, all 
<br>of whom are well-educated and internationally oriented, agree 
<br>with this sentiment. Nevertheless, they do appear to have 
<br>been genuinely stung by what they see as a sudden and 
<br>"unfair" rejection of China by many Western countries.
