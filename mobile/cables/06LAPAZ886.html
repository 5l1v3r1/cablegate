<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Amb. David N. Greenlee for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: President Morales is an astute domestic 
<br>political operator but lacks confidence in his economic and 
<br>international relations abilities. As a result, Morales has 
<br>surrounded himself with three compartmented groups of 
<br>advisers. The first are domestic political operators who 
<br>implement his political vision and serve as the attack dogs 
<br>for the President. The second group are Bolivian 
<br>intellectuals that help shore up his decisionmaking in 
<br>economics, intelligence and security, and international 
<br>relations, and implement policies on the ground, including 
<br>the Cuban doctors program, Venezuelan identification program, 
<br>and Bolivian land reform. The third group is his Cuban and 
<br>Venezuelan advisers, who seem to have growing influence with 
<br>the President, trumping even his intellectual advisers. This 
<br>cable is part one of three cables that looks at the 
<br>President, who is in his circle of domestic advisers, and how 
<br>he uses them, and their competition with the Cubans and 
<br>Venezuelans for the President's confidence. End summary. 
<br>
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>Evo: The seasoned Bolivian politician 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Radical cocalero union leader turned President Evo 
<br>Morales Ayma is a pragmatic leader whose domestic political 
<br>instincts are extraordinarily acute. Morales is an expert at 
<br>spinning stories in his favor, co-opting the platforms of his 
<br>adversaries, dividing his opposition, and appealing to his 
<br>bases. A leader with strong anti-democratic tendencies, over 
<br>the years he has been known to bribe, threaten, and even 
<br>physically intimidate anyone who has stood in his way, 
<br>including government officials, politicians, and cocalero 
<br>colleagues. He has shown great tactical flexibility and an 
<br>ability to out maneuver even his most formidable political 
<br>opponents to consolidate his own political power. Morales 
<br>has developed a reputation for consulting advisers and social 
<br>groups on domestic political issues, but is confident that he 
<br>is the expert, the advisor and the final decision maker for 
<br>those issues. (Comment: This is particularly true on the 
<br>coca issue.) His cadre of domestic political advisers 
<br>(SEPTEL), which include Senate President Santos Ramirez, 
<br>lower chamber President Edmundo Novillo, his personal 
<br>assistant Ivan Iporre, and Vice Minister of Government 
<br>Coordination and personal attorney Hector Arce, tends to 
<br>operate more as "yes men" who carry out the President's 
<br>orders than as advisers with real influence on the 
<br>President,s decisions. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>Evo: The struggling student 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) While Morales excels at domestic political 
<br>machinations, he is more like a struggling student in the 
<br>areas of economics and international relations 
<br>decisionmaking. A man who likes to be in control, Morales 
<br>has shown an eagerness for learning what he needs to make his 
<br>own decisions in these areas. He has sought out intellectual 
<br>"experts," primarily from Bolivia,s public universities, to 
<br>provide him tutoring in the areas he lacks. Morales often 
<br>tunes out detailed economic discussions with foreign 
<br>officials and will at times defer to his "experts" when 
<br>speaking to the press, large groups, and even US officials on 
<br>issues he is uncertain about. His domestic intellectual 
<br>advisers (SEPTEL), who include Vice President Alvaro Garcia 
<br>Linera, Minister of the Presidency Juan Ramon Quintana, and 
<br>Minister of Planning Carlos Villegas, are largely leftist 
<br>ideologues and have tended to have more influence with the 
<br>President compared to his domestic political advisers because 
<br>of his difficulty grasping complex economic theories and lack 
<br>of experience in the international arena. Unfortunately, 
<br>some of this advice borrows from a storehouse of discredited 
<br>ideas and fantasyland assumptions.

<br>
<br>
<br>Evo: The Cuban and Venezuelan conspirator 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S//NF) The third group is a pandora's box of Cuban and 
<br>Venezuelan advisers, who may have growing influence with the 
<br>President. While we do not know the extent of their 
<br>presence, sensitive reporting indicates that Morales meets 
<br>privately with his foreign advisers multiple times a week 
<br>without any domestic advisers present. The same reporting 
<br>also indicates that he receives both political and economic 
<br>advice from the Cubans. Morales is implementing several 
<br>programs initiated by the Cubans and Venezuelans in the areas 
<br>of education, health, and citizen registration. Several of 
<br>the President's domestic advisers are working hand in hand 
<br>with the Cubans and Venezuelans, seeking to replace US 
<br>markets with Venezuelan trade deals, and sensitive reporting 
<br>says that they are regularly traveling to Cuba for political 
<br>training. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Comment: Morales has had a roller-coaster 
<br>relationship with several of his key domestic advisers, 
<br>especially Vice President Garcia Linera. He is highly 
<br>suspicious by nature and is unlikely to tolerate advisers 
<br>with their own agenda for power and recognition. Morales 
<br>likely sees the Cuban and Venezuelan advisers as 
<br>non-threatening to his domestic power. In addition, as an 
<br>admirer of Cuban President Fidel Castro and Venezuelan 
<br>President Hugo Chavez, Morales probably is drawn by the 
<br>longevity of their time in power and seeks to emulate their 
<br>"success." If Morales grows wary of his domestic advisers he 
<br>is likely to rely more heavily on his foreign advisers to 
<br>carry out his vision. End comment.
