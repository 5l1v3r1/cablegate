<br>SUBJECT: APHSCT TOWNSEND'S VISIT TO MOROCCO 
<br>
<br>Classified by Ambassador Thomas Riley for reasons 1.4 (b) and 
<br>(d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: During her July 6-8 visit to Morocco, 
<br>Frances Fragos Townsend, Assistant to the President for 
<br>Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, met with the chiefs 
<br>of Morocco's intelligence service, the internal security 
<br>service, the chief of the national police, the Minister of 
<br>Interior, and his deputy, a senior royal advisor. Townsend 
<br>thanked her hosts for Morocco's excellent cooperation in the 
<br>global war on terrorism, including significant efforts to 
<br>shut down the foreign fighter pipeline to Iraq. The 
<br>Moroccans affirmed that they highly value security 
<br>cooperation and support from the USG as they continue to 
<br>confront a substantial and growing terror threat that extends 
<br>across North Africa and the Sahel. Townsend also visited 
<br>the sites of twin suicide bombings near the U.S. 
<br>Consulate-General and the (private) American Language Center 
<br>and received a briefing on efforts to augment security for 
<br>U.S. buildings and personnel in the city. End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Frances Fragos Townsend, Assistant to the President 
<br>for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, was hosted for a 
<br>July 7 working lunch in Rabat by Yassine Mansouri, Chief of 
<br>the External Studies Directorate General (DGED), Morocco's 
<br>premier intelligence agency. Joining the lunch were 
<br>Abdelatif Hammouchi, Director-General for Territorial 
<br>Surveillance (DGST), which has the lead on domestic 
<br>counterterrorism operations, and Charki Draiss, Chief of the 
<br>National Police force (DGSN). Townsend was accompanied by 
<br>Ambassador Riley, Adnan Kifayat and John Pearson of the NSC 
<br>staff, and Emboffs. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Welcoming Townsend to Morocco, DGED Chief Mansouri 
<br>affirmed that the country has enjoyed a long-standing and 
<br>very cooperative security relationship with the USG, to the 
<br>benefit of both sides. Townsend expressed U.S. satisfaction 
<br>with the security relationship and particular gratitude for 
<br>Morocco's robust efforts to shut down the foreign fighter 
<br>pipeline to Iraq. The Moroccans made clear that stopping 
<br>foreign fighters bound for Iraq or other destinations was a 
<br>major GOM priority. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) DGST Chief Hammouchi noted that Morocco has 
<br>disrupted 83 different terrorist cells since the 2003 
<br>Casablanca bombings. A number of cells identified have had 
<br>connections to the Algerian GSPC, he noted. Mansouri added 
<br>that the terrorist adversary is "very strategically minded" 
<br>and is always seeking ways to maximize the impact of attacks 
<br>by exploiting outside events. Townsend strongly agreed: The 
<br>timing of the attempted car bombs in London and the Glasgow 
<br>airport attack to coincide with the transition from the Blair 
<br>to the Brown government, was a case in point, she opined. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Townsend asked her hosts about the GOM's approach 
<br>to monitoring and controlling materials that can be 
<br>precursors to explosives. TATP, which was used in the April 
<br>attacks in Morocco, is made from readily available 
<br>ingredients, she noted. Hammouchi stated that the broad 
<br>availability of explosive precursors was a source of 
<br>frustration for the GOM. He recalled a case in which a 
<br>violent Jihadist had sent his wife on 38 separate trips, in 
<br>multiple cities, to buy hydrogen peroxide from pharmacies. 
<br>"Our only weapon against this phenomenon is information," 
<br>Hammouchi opined. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) The security chiefs underlined their conviction 
<br>that the terrorist threat to Morocco was transnational in 
<br>nature. At least 12 cells wrapped up in recent years have 
<br>had direct connections to groups operating in Algeria, 
<br>Northern Mali, and Spain. Of particular concern is recent 
<br>information that a number of individuals in terror camps in 
<br>Northern Mali have moved from training units to operational 
<br>units. This information, and the approach of important 
<br>events on Morocco's political calendar, such as the "Fete du 
<br>Throne" (Throne Day) and the parliamentary elections in early 
<br>September, prompted Morocco to elevate its alert level on 
<br>July 5. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) Townsend asked the security chiefs for their 
<br>assessment of CT cooperation between the countries of the 
<br>Maghreb region. Cooperation with the Algerians was erratic, 
<br>Hammouchi assessed. Sometimes they provide very good 
<br>information and sometimes it seems like a one-way street. 
<br>They make difficult partners, Mansouri added, speculating 
<br>that they still suffered psychic trauma from their bloody 
<br>
<br>RABAT 00001229 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>struggle against terror in the 1990s, a battle they fought 
<br>largely on their own. Security cooperation with Libya has 
<br>been good, Mansouri noted, they are ready to work with us and 
<br>exchange information. There has been an improvement in 
<br>cooperation with the Tunisians as well, he continued, though 
<br>he opined that they are still prone to denial in assessing 
<br>the terror threat. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S/NF) Turning to the ideological front in the war on 
<br>terror, the security chiefs affirmed that CT disruption and 
<br>preemption operations alone were not sufficient to defeat the 
<br>enemy. "We have had to become involved in the ideological 
<br>battle, even if this isn't our business," Hammouchi stated. 
<br>"Unfortunately, political and diplomatic restraints often 
<br>limit our ability to act," he added. Citing President Bush, 
<br>Townsend affirmed the U.S. belief that the war of words and 
<br>ideas is a core theater of battle, but often an area where 
<br>Muslim leaders can be more effective than Americans. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) Townsend asked about lines of authority within the 
<br>Moroccan government in pursuing the ideological battle 
<br>against terrorists. Mansouri responded that there was a 
<br>diffusion of authority, with the security agencies, the 
<br>Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Religious 
<br>Affairs all countering extremism in different ways. Townsend 
<br>observed that this mirrored the diffusion of 
<br>counter-extremist efforts in the USG, but wondered if both 
<br>systems wouldn't benefit from centralization of efforts. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Subsequent to the lunch, Minister of Interior 
<br>Chakib Benmoussa welcomed Townsend, the Ambassador, NSC 
<br>staff, and emboffs to his office. The Minister was joined by 
<br>Minister-Delegate Fouad Ali Himma (who, as a long-standing 
<br>friend and close advisor of King Mohammed VI, is generally 
<br>considered more powerful than the Minister), and senior MOI 
<br>officials Khalid Zerouali, Mohieddine Amzazi, Noureddine 
<br>Benbrahim, and Abderahmane Achour. 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Affirming her appreciation of strong bilateral 
<br>security cooperation, Townsend asked her hosts for more 
<br>background on Morocco's recent decision to elevate its state 
<br>of alert. The Minister said that information developed 
<br>following recent arrests of Moroccans in the U.K., Spain, and 
<br>Morocco, a continuing stream of general threat information, 
<br>and upcoming events including the Fete du Throne and the 
<br>legislative elections all prompted Moroccan security 
<br>officials to conclude that it would be prudent to elevate the 
<br>alert level. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) Townsend expressed understanding, mentioning the 
<br>USG's experience that it was relatively easy to raise the 
<br>alert level, but more difficult to bring it back down. 
<br>Explaining such decisions to the public was always tricky, 
<br>she added. Himma agreed that the relationship between the 
<br>security services and the public was crucially important and 
<br>merited constant attention. Educating the public about the 
<br>nature of the threat and enlisting them as allies is 
<br>particularly important he added. 
<br>
<br>¶13. (S/NF) Defending the Malikite rite of Islam, native to 
<br>Morocco, against intolerant theological strains flowing out 
<br>of the Middle East was a major priority for King Mohammed VI 
<br>and his government, Himma emphasized. He asserted that in 
<br>Morocco "our people are religious and conservative, but not 
<br>fundamentalist. Our rite is completely opposed to radical 
<br>theology." Himma cited recent efforts to overhaul and 
<br>upgrade the religious education system in the country, 
<br>traditionally subsidized by the monarchy. The GOM is working 
<br>hard to strike a balance between Moroccan tradition and 
<br>modernity, seeking to take the best from both. Himma also 
<br>cited the King's human development initiative, launched in 
<br>2005, as an important piece of the counter-extremist puzzle. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (S/NF) Townsend complimented the Minister for Morocco's 
<br>apparent success in integrating various elements of the GOM 
<br>involved in countering terror and extremism into a cohesive 
<br>team. Himma affirmed that the GOM strives to work as one 
<br>integrated unit, and also lauded the strong security 
<br>cooperation Morocco enjoys with countries like the U.S. and 
<br>Spain. "But our ambition is even higher," Himma continued. 
<br>We would like to have the same level of coordination and 
<br>cooperation with our neighboring countries, particularly 
<br>Algeria. 
<br>
<br>¶15. (S/NF) Recalling a visit to Algiers as the King's 
<br>personal envoy, Himma asserted that repeated Moroccan efforts 
<br>
<br>RABAT 00001229 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>to bridge the diplomatic chasm had been rebuffed. He claimed 
<br>that he had told the Algerians that Morocco was prepared to 
<br>reopen its border and take any of a number of other 
<br>confidence building measures, "but the Algerians would never 
<br>tell us what they want." He attributed what he described as 
<br>Algerian intransigence to a generational and mind-set gap 
<br>between the leaderships of the two countries. Noting that 
<br>Algiers was the next stop on her multi-country itinerary, 
<br>Townsend said she would encourage the GOA to expand security 
<br>cooperation with Morocco and to work hard to realize a 
<br>broader rapprochement with its neighbor. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (S/NF) Prior to her arrival in Rabat, Townsend visited 
<br>the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca, which was targeted 
<br>during a twin suicide bomb attack on April 14. The CG, RSO, 
<br>and Emboffs briefed Townsend on the incident, showing her the 
<br>site of the bomb which detonated near the Consulate General, 
<br>and the site of the bombing which targeted the American 
<br>Language Center one block away, which was apparently mistaken 
<br>for a USG facility. Townsend reviewed CCTV footage of the 
<br>attack, and received a briefing on upgrades being implemented 
<br>to enhance the physical security of Consulate facilities and 
<br>personnel.
