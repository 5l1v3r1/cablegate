<br>¶B. OCTOBER 25 PARIS POINTS 
<br>
<br>Classified By: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT, FOR REAS 
<br>ONS 1.4 B/D 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) During a conversation November 3 with terrorism 
<br>investigating judge Jean-Francois Ricard, Poloff asked for 
<br>his analysis of recent violence in the suburbs (ref A). 
<br>Ricard began by saying that no one in the French government 
<br>should be surprised by what has happened. Successive 
<br>governments have tried and failed to integrate suburbs with 
<br>high immigrant populations. For "the last twenty years," 
<br>said Ricard, the GOF has known that the suburbs have become 
<br>areas where respect for the state has dried up. As a result 
<br>of this inattention, the suburbs with high immigrant 
<br>populations have lost their French identity and have built up 
<br>an identity based on the "cites," (similar to the 
<br>"projects"). French symbols of authority, like the fireman 
<br>and policeman, are considered to be "assassins" and worthy of 
<br>being targeted. In addition, gangs and radical Islamic 
<br>groups have an interest in keeping the cites free of GOF 
<br>influence to maintain their freedom of operation. French 
<br>intelligence can only do so much, said Ricard. The areas 
<br>need a substantial GOF presence, i.e., police and gendarmerie. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Ricard criticized many current French analyses as 
<br>"tired leftist critiques" uttered by those who have no 
<br>understanding of the world of the cites. He said they 
<br>focused only on socio-economic problems, viewing the cites 
<br>inhabitants as victims of precarious living situations -- 
<br>young people who are unemployed and uneducated, with poor 
<br>prospects for the future. When he had been an ordinary 
<br>investigating judge in the northern suburb of Bobigny, Ricard 
<br>said people were relatively well-off. They had cars and 
<br>televisions and other material possessions. Other areas of 
<br>France, such as the north near Belgium, were much poorer, 
<br>said Ricard. The real problem was the GOF's failure to be 
<br>present in these areas. Inhabitants developed a sense of 
<br>being apart from French society, and over time, became proud 
<br>of this. The combination of setting oneself apart, real 
<br>and/or imagined grievances against the GOF, state 
<br>inattention, and the interest of gangs and other groups, 
<br>including Islamists, to accentuate this divide, has led to 
<br>the current unrest, said Ricard. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) If the unrest dies out "very quickly," this would be 
<br>bad news, said Ricard. It would mean that gangs and other 
<br>groups in the cites exert a powerful control over those 
<br>currently burning cars and assaulting police. These gangs 
<br>have no interest in triggering a massive GOF response, 
<br>because it would mean the long-term "occupation" of the 
<br>cites. If the unrest goes on for much more than a week, 
<br>Ricard said it would signify that the cites have become 
<br>completely anarchic. He speculated that one reason for the 
<br>riots might have been Sarkozy's announcement in late October 
<br>of an increased GOF security presence in the cites, including 
<br>17 companies of CRS (specialized crowd control police) and 7 
<br>platoons of specialized gendarmes (ref B). (Note: In a 
<br>strangely prescient interview with Le Monde on October 25 
<br>about his plan to increase security in the cites, Sarkozy 
<br>said that, since the beginning of 2005, "9000 police 
<br>vehicles" in France have had stones and other projectiles 
<br>thrown at them. Every night, Sarkozy continued, "between 20 
<br>and 40 " vehicles (presumably not only police vehicles) are 
<br>burned or otherwise set on fire. End note.)
