<br>
<br>
<br>¶1. (SBU) September 29, 2009; 8:30 a.m.; St. Regis Hotel,
<br>Beijing.
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) Participants:
<br>
<br>United states
<br>Deputy Secretary Steinberg
<br>Laura Stone (notetaker)
<br>
<br>China
<br>xxxxx
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: Deputy Secretary Steinberg explained U.S.
<br>confidence-building and transparency objectives vis-a-vis
<br>Iran that we planned to pursue at the October 1
<br>P5-plus-1-plus-Iran Political Directors meeting. xxxxx
<br>emphasized the importance of sustaining the
<br>dialogue, expressed hope that U.S. domestic political
<br>pressure would not lead the U.S. to pursue UN sanctions, and
<br>affirmed the need for monitoring, supervision and benchmarks.
<br>The Deputy Secretary rejected the idea that politics were
<br>motivating U.S. Iran policy, and made clear the U.S. position
<br>that we need to resolve, not just monitor and supervise, the
<br>Iranian nuclear problem. On the upcoming POTUS visit, xxxxx
<br>suggested that a joint statement reflect the balanced,
<br>comprehensive nature of the relationship while also
<br>addressing each country's "core" interests. xxxxx expressed
<br>worry that the Copenhagen climate change meeting could
<br>overshadow the trip. xxxxx welcomed the institutionalized
<br>G-20, downplayed the importance of Premier Wen Jiabao's
<br>announced October 4-6 trip to Pyongyang, and bemoaned the
<br>U.S. 421 tire safeguards decision. End summary.
<br>
<br>Iran
<br>----
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) The Deputy Secretary explained U.S. objectives for the
<br>October 1 P5-plus-1 Political Directors meeting with Iran.
<br>xxxxx outlined actions in support of the pillars of confidence
<br>building and transparency that Iran needed to undertake to
<br>establish its seriousness in addressing the nuclear issue.
<br>On process objectives, the Deputy Secretary noted that the
<br>nuclear issue would need to remain the primary subject in
<br>follow-up experts meetings, although other agenda topics were
<br>possible.
<br>
<br>¶3. (S)xxxxx.
<br>Based on Chinese communications with Iran, xxxxx, xxxxx
<br>thought it would be difficult for Iran to refuse talks, since
<br>entering into dialogue was the only way to diffuse tensions.
<br>xxxxx was less certain about the prospect of Tehran giving up
<br>its nuclear program. xxxxx asserted that because the
<br>weapons program was "not quite there yet" and the facilities
<br>were all dual-use in nature, Iran's assertions that the
<br>program was for peaceful use were "50-percent true." The
<br>key, according to xxxxx, was monitoring and supervision,
<br>while establishing benchmarks that Iran should not cross.
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) xxxxx suggested that the first objective of the
<br>October 1 meeting with Iran should be to keep the dialogue
<br>alive. xxxxx asked that the United States not reject Iranian
<br>attempts to broaden the conversation or create the impression
<br>that the talks were not making progress. Noting that
<br>President Obama had told President Hu Jintao that resolving
<br>the Iran situation was a pressing U.S. interest, xxxxx asked
<br>how long the United States would remain patient in the face
<br>of limited progress. xxxxx expressed hope that "domestic
<br>political pressure" would not lead the United States to seek
<br>new UN Security Council sanctions.
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) The Deputy Secretary stated that domestic political
<br>factors were not driving our approach to Iran, but rather a
<br>
<br>Beijing 00002963 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>conviction -- shared by Britain and France -- of the need to
<br>resolve the Iranian nuclear problem. The nuclear issue
<br>needed to be discussed up front in talks; the process could
<br>not stay alive without Iran committing to some
<br>confidence-building measures. Monitoring and supervision
<br>were not adequate, as the North Korean case had demonstrated.
<br>
<br>POTUS Visit
<br>-----------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) xxxxx asked that the upcoming POTUS visit reflect the
<br>balanced, comprehensive nature of the relationship, including
<br>economic, security, cultural, economic and people-to-people
<br>ties. A joint statement should not be too detailed and
<br>should instead mirror the status of two of the world's most
<br>important leaders. That said, the statement had to address,
<br>in a positive way, both countries' "core" interests. xxxxx
<br>expressed worry that the early-December Copenhagen climate
<br>change meetings could overshadow the POTUS visit, and
<br>recommended that China and the United States focus during the
<br>visit on our respective national commitments in the realm of
<br>climate change.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) xxxxx raised xxxxx proposal for a "humanities" MOU that
<br>would cover people-to-people, cultural, and science and
<br>technology exchanges, saying xxxxx hoped to make this one of the
<br>"gems" of the visit. xxxxx suggested that the presidents sign
<br>the clean energy and environmental protection MOU.
<br>
<br>G-20
<br>----
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxx thanked President Obama for his leadership in
<br>institutionalizing the G-20, which had created a
<br>"comfortable" platform for countries like China and India to
<br>play a larger role. xxxxx explained that there had been some
<br>domestic criticism of President Hu's participation in the
<br>G8-plus-5. xxxxx expressed hope that the United States would
<br>coordinate closely with China as we established new rules for
<br>the organization, and that it would not become an
<br>organization that duplicated the United Nations or the G-8.
<br>xxxxx expressed reservations about how fast the G-20 could
<br>expand to handle issues beyond economics and finance, but
<br>noted that if the organization was going to stay relevant for
<br>leaders it's scope would have to grow. xxxxx specifically
<br>mentioned the need for a coordinating mechanism on global
<br>diseases and counter-terrorism.
<br>
<br>North Korea
<br>-----------
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) xxxxx downplayed Premier Wen Jiabao's upcoming
<br>October 4-6 visit to Pyongyang, stating "we may not like
<br>them," but "they (the DPRK) are a neighbor," and the trip was
<br>part of the 60th anniversary of relations celebrations. xxxxx
<br>stated that the Premier would convey a strong message on the
<br>need to denuclearize, to come back to the Six-Party talks,
<br>and to not abandon the Six-Party Talks framework. xxxxx noted
<br>that North Korea often tried to play China off the United
<br>States, refusing to convey information about U.S.-DPRK
<br>bilateral conversations. Clearly seeking a clarification for
<br>the record, xxxxx asked if the United States were prepared
<br>to accept a nuclear-armed but non-proliferating North Korea.
<br>The Deputy Secretary stated this was not acceptable or
<br>sustainable.
<br>
<br>Tires
<br>-----
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) xxxxx lamented the United States' recent 421 tire
<br>decision, and expressed concern that lawyers in the United
<br>States were preparing additional cases on products such as
<br>textiles. xxxxx opined that China and the United States relied
<br>too much on "technical" negotiators.
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) The Deputy Secretary has cleared this message.
