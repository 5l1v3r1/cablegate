<br>REF: A. SECSTATE 121837
<br>¶B. 2006 MADRID 1914
<br>
<br>Classified By: DCM HUGO LLORENS FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (C)
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Based on Reftel A request, Embassy Legatt on
<br>September 4 met with Javier Zaragoza, Chief of the Spanish
<br>National Court, to discuss the case of Guantanamo detainees
<br>Jamil El Banna and Omar Deghays. Legatt reminded Zaragoza
<br>that the GOS requested the extradition of El Banna and
<br>Deghays in 2004 and inquired whether the two continued to
<br>face charges in Spain. Specifically, we asked whether the
<br>Spanish government is prepared to accept their transfer for
<br>law enforcement purposes. Zaragoza was very familiar with
<br>the cases surrounding the two individuals and has been
<br>looking into this issue since we made informal contact in
<br>July. He promised to look into Reftel questions and respond
<br>as soon as possible. Zaragoza finally responded on September
<br>12 and said that the two individuals are still wanted in
<br>Spain and that the Spanish government would accept their
<br>transfer. However, Zaragoza quickly added that he could make
<br>no promises about the strength of the case that could be
<br>brought against them, the probability they would be
<br>convicted, or their status in Spain should they be found not
<br>guilty and released. He said he was not optimistic about the
<br>chances of a conviction. Zaragoza said that Baltasar Garzon
<br>is in charge of the two cases and would be the lead
<br>prosecutor during any potential trial.
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) Comment. Judge Garzon was the prosecutor on both
<br>the Lachsen Ikassrien and Hamid Abdurrahman cases (per Reftel
<br>B, the two former Guantanamo inmates whose convictions in
<br>Spain were later overturned after the Spanish High Court
<br>ruled inadmissible any evidence gathered in conjunction with
<br>their time at Guantanamo), and he had a field day in the
<br>Spanish press criticizing Guantanamo and US CT policies after
<br>the two men were released. Zaragoza warned of the
<br>possibility of a similar situation should the cases of El
<br>Banna and Deghays fall apart, and Embassy Madrid believes the
<br>publicity-seeking Garzon would not think twice about
<br>following a similar tack.
