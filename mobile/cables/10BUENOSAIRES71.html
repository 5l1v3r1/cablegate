<br>SUBJECT: Argentina: Saber Rattling over Oil Exploration in the
<br>Falklands
<br>
<br>CLASSIFIED BY: Tom Kelly, DCM; REASON: 1.4(B), (D)
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) This is the first in a series of cables which will address
<br>the Argentine reaction to hydrocarbons-related activities in the
<br>Falklands/Malvinas islands.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The GoA is reportedly hardening its policy on the
<br>Falkland/Malvinas Islands in response to accelerating oil
<br>exploration efforts under British authority that lack Argentine
<br>participation or consent. According to local press reports, the
<br>Foreign Ministry has created a plan to press Argentina's historic
<br>claim to the islands which involves expressing displeasure to the
<br>UK, to any companies involved, and to the governments of the
<br>companies' home countries. This could involve the USG, since an
<br>American supplier is sending a drilling rig to the islands. These
<br>steps follow a 2007 resolution which threatens to cut off the
<br>Argentine operations of any oil company that operates in the
<br>Falklands without GoA permission. British diplomats in Argentina
<br>are not sure how far the GoA will take these threats, and do not
<br>rule out an "irrational" response. At present, no U.S. energy
<br>company operating in Argentina appears to be considering activity
<br>in the Falklands. End Summary.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Keep Your Oil Equipment Away from Our Islands
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (SBU) Argentine press reports on January 27 state that the
<br>Argentine Foreign Ministry (MFA) has developed a plan to resist oil
<br>exploration in the Falklands/Malvinas islands located to the east
<br>of southern Argentina, a territory claimed by the Argentines and
<br>the British, but controlled by the British. British firm Desire
<br>Petroleum is reportedly moving a drilling rig to the area to drill
<br>exploratory wells. The GoA plans to assert that "any hydrocarbons
<br>operation in the Malvinas area linked to the UK is 'illegal'
<br>because, by authorizing it, the UK government is assuming
<br>competency in areas of the continental shelf which are subject to
<br>Argentine jurisdiction and sovereignty." The GoA has reportedly
<br>planned three courses of action: a formal protest to the UK;
<br>sending "notes of discouragement" to each company involved in such
<br>activities, advising them that their actions are "illegal" and they
<br>could therefore face legal sanctions; and, in the case where
<br>companies are not British, sending protest notes to the
<br>corresponding government(s) signaling GoA concern over the
<br>"illegal" activities and noting possible sanctions. The USG could
<br>receive a note under the third category because the U.S. firm
<br>Diamond Drilling owns a drilling rig en route to the islands (and
<br>expected to be in place by mid-February).
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) The above GoA policy would be consistent with Energy
<br>Secretariat Resolution 407 issued in 2007, which threatens to
<br>terminate the Argentine activities (including the cancellation of
<br>all energy concessions) of any company that operates in the
<br>Falklands area without express GoA permission. Energy analyst
<br>Daniel Gerold sees little chance of GoA sanctions against companies
<br>while the process remains in the exploration stage. However, in
<br>the event of a significant hydrocarbons discovery (either petroleum
<br>or natural gas, which he believes is more likely), Gerold foresees
<br>the GoA making it "a major issue," as more companies become
<br>involved in the extraction process -- and as the GoA perceives it
<br>is missing out on a significant revenue stream.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>What Next? Brits Concerned
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Argentina launched the first diplomatic shot across the
<br>British bow on February 2; British diplomats in Argentina confirmed
<br>to EconOff that the GoA delivered a formal protest to their ChargC)
<br>that afternoon. UK political Officers Lynda St Cooke and Oliver
<br>Moss (the latter a former Shell Oil employee) previously told
<br>EconOff January 28 that, while such a protest was expected and
<br>routine (they receive numerous Falklands-related communications
<br>
<br>
<br>from the GoA each year), they were still concerned over where GoA
<br>actions might lead. Their concern is over the shape of future
<br>sanctions on companies as well as threats and protests against
<br>energy companies operating in the Falklands by NGOs, including
<br>environmental activists.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) On possible sanctions, St Cooke believes that the GoA will
<br>seek to "make an example" of a company if possible, and she
<br>wondered what would happen if the first company to cross the "line
<br>in the sand" were one with significant activities in Argentina.
<br>She cited Schlumberger as an example of a company which could
<br>provide services for oil extraction in the Falklands, given its
<br>extensive global operations, including within Argentina. She noted
<br>that stopping its Argentine operations would be very detrimental to
<br>Argentine hydrocarbons production. While pursuing such an action
<br>would be "irrational" for the GoA, she said, "We can't rule it
<br>out." She added that this is a very one-sided issue in Argentina.
<br>Since there are virtually no advocates for relinquishing
<br>Argentina's claim to the islands, which is taught as sacred writ to
<br>Argentine children beginning in elementary school, there could be
<br>significant political pressure on the GoA to take action in case of
<br>an oil discovery. Gerold agreed and suggested that, following a
<br>significant hydrocarbon find, the GoA would quickly seek to begin
<br>operations in its (undisputed) Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as
<br>close as possible to the location of the find.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶7. (SBU) U.S. companies currently operating in Argentina have not
<br>indicated an interest to participate in current exploration
<br>activities near the Falklands; Randy Smith, ExxonMobil's Public and
<br>Government Affairs Manager, told Econoff January 29 that his
<br>company is not interested..
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Although the budget-strapped Argentine military is
<br>ill-prepared for any course of action involving projection of
<br>power, the GoA would likely feel compelled by a significant
<br>hydrocarbon find to press Argentina's historic claims by any other
<br>possible means. A strategy of tough talk, complaints in
<br>international fora, and protest letters is likely, with economic
<br>sanctions against participating companies possible, even if they
<br>might damage Argentina's own hydrocarbons output.
