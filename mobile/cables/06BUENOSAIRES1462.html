<br>SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION
<br>------------------------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) This cable is designed to examine President Nestor
<br>Kirchner's unique operating and decision-making style that
<br>has become known as the "K-Style." Given Kirchner's control
<br>over all aspects of GOA policymaking, knowledge of Kirchner's
<br>motivations and methods in arriving at decisions is essential
<br>to understanding GOA actions.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) President Nestor Kirchner's personalistic, often
<br>erratic operating and decision-making style defines current
<br>Argentine policymaking and is characterized by an overarching
<br>focus on the short-term and politically expedient
<br>accumulation and maintenance of domestic political power.
<br>Kirchner's domestic political style leaves no room for
<br>dissent and utilizes divide-and-conquer tactics to weaken the
<br>political opposition. While utilizing leftist, populist
<br>rhetoric at times, in practice Kirchner has demonstrated that
<br>his ideological leanings are always less important than the
<br>practicalities of domestic politics. Studies show that
<br>Kirchner's psychological profile includes a need to always be
<br>in control, quick and decisive decision making, a constant
<br>struggle against perceived enemies, and a tendency to respond
<br>to challenges by lashing out, rather than negotiation.
<br>Foreign policy in the Kirchner government is always
<br>subservient to domestic political considerations. President
<br>Kirchner is not skilled at international diplomacy and often
<br>ignores basic protocol. Kirchner relies on an ever-shrinking
<br>group of long-time advisors to make key decisions, many of
<br>whom lack international, business and economic expertise.
<br>END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.
<br>
<br>--------------------------------
<br>THE K-STYLE IN DOMESTIC POLITICS
<br>--------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) President Nestor Kirchner's personalistic, often
<br>erratic operating and decision-making style defines current
<br>Argentine policymaking and is characterized by an overarching
<br>focus on the short-term and politically expedient
<br>accumulation and maintenance of domestic political power.
<br>Close Kirchner insiders have described Kirchner's
<br>decision-making process to Emboffs as one in which Kirchner
<br>consults with a small number of trusted advisors, generally
<br>one-on-one, and then makes all of the final decisions
<br>himself. The Argentine political system places a great deal
<br>of authority into the hands of the President, and President
<br>Kirchner is a strong president even in the Argentine
<br>historical context. As a result, the "K-Style" defines the
<br>GOA policymaking process and gives the policy process a
<br>short-term focus. As Legal and Technical Secretary Carlos
<br>Zannini, a close Kirchner advisor, told the DCM, "The
<br>President and I get up every morning, look at the morning
<br>papers, and try to figure out how to survive the day."
<br>Another long-time Kirchner associate, former Santa Cruz
<br>Governor Sergio Acevedo told us that Kirchner focuses very
<br>much on day-to-day issues, but always with the long-term
<br>strategic goal of retaining political power. (COMMENT:
<br>Kirchner's focus on retaining political power leads us to
<br>discount speculation that Kirchner will step aside in 2007
<br>and make his wife Cristina the presidential candidate. For
<br>2011, assuming Kirchner's health holds, we would expect him
<br>to either modify the Constitution to allow him to run for a
<br>third term, or to pass the mantel on to his wife. END
<br>COMMENT.)
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Kirchner's domestic political style leaves no room
<br>for dissent and utilizes divide-and-conquer tactics to weaken
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00001462 002 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>the political opposition. Kirchner is quick to silence any
<br>opposition to his policies from within his movement, as when
<br>he recently expelled congresswoman Maria del Carmen Alarcon
<br>from the presidency of the Lower House Agricultural Committee
<br>and from Kirchner's Victory Front (FPV) after Alarcon
<br>criticized the GOA beef policy (See Reftel A). Kirchner has
<br>also proven adept at co-opting members of the opposition and
<br>exploiting divisions within opposition parties. Through the
<br>skillful use of his fiscal powers, Kirchner has been able to
<br>draw in the majority of the Radical Civic Union (UCR)
<br>governors, and many UCR mayors (See Septel on deteriorating
<br>provincial finances and Kirchner's use of fiscal power for
<br>political aims). He has also been able to co-opt the
<br>political leadership from the now defunct center-left Frepaso
<br>and most of the Peronists formerly aligned in opposition to
<br>Kirchner with former President Eduardo Duhalde. Kirchner has
<br>exploited divisions within the UCR by heavily courting
<br>Mendoza Governor Julio Cobos, long-time rival of UCR
<br>President Roberto Iglesias, even encouraging rumors that
<br>Cobos may be Kirchner's running mate in 2007. Kirchner also
<br>does not accept criticism from those outside of the political
<br>arena, attacking the press, the Catholic Church and business
<br>leaders that have been publicly critical of the GOA.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) While utilizing leftist, populist rhetoric at times,
<br>in practice Kirchner has demonstrated that his ideological
<br>leanings are always less important than the practicalities of
<br>domestic politics. As Acevedo recently told us, President
<br>Kirchner has no true ideology. For example, the issue of
<br>human rights and his political affiliations in the 1970s were
<br>non-issues in the 20 years of Kirchner's political life as
<br>Mayor of Rio Gallegos and Governor of Santa Cruz province.
<br>Acevedo said Kirchner's recent support for the Mothers of the
<br>Plaza de Mayo and a renewed focus on human rights crimes
<br>committed under the last dictatorship was driven by his need
<br>to develop a core base of support within the left wing of the
<br>Peronist movement. Kirchner was also a big proponent of the
<br>1990s privatizations at the time they occurred, but has since
<br>vehemently attacked them. This does not mean that Kirchner
<br>does not have left-wing sympathies, but rather that these are
<br>completely subordinate to his personal political interests
<br>and ambition (See Reftel B). Kirchner's left-wing sympathies
<br>have not stopped him from forming alliances of convenience
<br>with center-right Peronist leaders, such as Luis Barrionuevo
<br>of Catamarca, Cordoba Governor Jose Manuel de la Sota, or the
<br>largely conservative Peronist political machine in Buenos
<br>Aires province.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Kirchner's style of policymaking has become more
<br>pronounced after the October 2005 elections and November 2005
<br>cabinet changes left Kirchner firmly in charge of all aspects
<br>of GOA decision making (See Reftel C). Prior to the October
<br>elections, Kirchner had to consider former President
<br>Duhalde's opinion in making major decisions. Kirchner's
<br>resounding victory in Buenos Aires province in the elections
<br>left him in control of the Peronist Party (PJ) and banished
<br>Duhalde from the center stage of the political scene. Before
<br>Kirchner's November cabinet changes, Kirchner also had to
<br>contend with his independent-minded Minister of the Economy,
<br>Roberto Lavagna, in making economic policy decisions, and
<br>with then-Foreign Minister Rafael Bielsa, who occasionally
<br>exhibited an independent streak. Their replacements, Felisa
<br>Miceli and Jorge Taiana are loyal soldiers who follow
<br>presidential orders. For example, recently Miceli was give a
<br>copy of a communique that had been issued to a news agency by
<br>the Casa Rosada with Miceli's comments criticizing a recent
<br>speech by Lavagna before Miceli had actually spoken. As
<br>leading pollster Roberto Bacman told Poloff, "Never since the
<br>return to democracy (1983) has Argentina had a President that
<br>was also the Minister of the Economy."
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>KIRCHNER'S PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE SETS K-STYLE
<br>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) According to recent studies, Kirchner's psychological
<br>profile includes a need to always be in control, quick and
<br>decisive decision making, and a constant struggle against
<br>perceived enemies. Kirchner does not delegate policymaking,
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00001462 003 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>making all of the important decisions himself. Kirchner only
<br>consults with a narrow group of long-time advisors, who are
<br>part of Kirchner's inner circle primarily because of their
<br>loyalty, not their technical abilities (See Reftel D). He
<br>often does not even consult or give warning to top GOA
<br>officials before making major policy statements in their
<br>respective areas of responsibility. According to Central
<br>Bank officials, for example, Central Bank President Martin
<br>Redrado found out that the GOA was going to use nearly 10 USD
<br>billion in Central Bank reserves to pay off the IMF when
<br>Kirchner publicly announced it. Casa Rosada insiders have
<br>described Kirchner as prone to making quick, sometimes even
<br>rash decisions. For example, Kirchner reportedly made a snap
<br>decision to institute a six-month ban on beef exports after
<br>learning that the price of beef had risen a significant
<br>amount the previous day in the country's most important beef
<br>market. Kirchner has lashed out at has perceived enemies,
<br>both domestic and foreign, throughout his presidency.
<br>Kirchner's targets have included the IMF, the U.S., the
<br>media, the Catholic Church, the Argentine military, the
<br>foreign and domestic business community, supermarkets,
<br>foreign gas stations, anything that happened in the 1990s,
<br>former Presidents Carlos Menem, Fernando de la Rua and
<br>Eduardo Duhalde. Kirchner often targets unpopular groups or
<br>individuals as a means to increase his own public approval
<br>ratings.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) When confronted with a problem, Kirchner's first
<br>instinct is to go on the offensive, rather than negotiate,
<br>upping the ante if his initial efforts fail to win the
<br>desired result. When Kirchner faced resistance from the
<br>business and agricultural sector on his efforts to control
<br>inflation earlier in the year, Kirchner instituted a ban on
<br>the export of beef and appointed the unorthodox Peronist
<br>economist Guillermo Moreno to run the GOA's anti-inflation
<br>efforts through bullying and threatening individual producers
<br>to lower their prices. When Uruguayan President Tabare
<br>Vazquez did not respond well to Kirchner's insistence that
<br>Uruguay halt the construction of two paper plants on the
<br>Argentine border to conduct additional environmental studies,
<br>Kirchner's rhetoric encouraged the residents of the affected
<br>province to step up their blockade of the bridges connecting
<br>the two countries, resulting in millions of dollars of lost
<br>trade and tourism income for Uruguay. Faced with rising gas
<br>prices in early 2005, Kirchner called for a national boycott
<br>of Shell Oil and sent thousands of piqueteros to blockade
<br>Shell Oil gas stations until they agreed to lower their
<br>prices.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Kirchner has a reputation for taking slights or any
<br>perceived lack of respect from others personally, but is also
<br>known for quick changes in temperament. Acevedo told the DCM
<br>that once then-Governor Kirchner became enraged with his
<br>Deputy Energy Minister for making a statement regarding Santa
<br>Cruz energy policy he did not personally approve. Kirchner
<br>called the Deputy Minister into his office and proceeded to
<br>scream at him at the top of his lungs, ultimately effectively
<br>throwing him out of his office physically. Everyone in the
<br>provincial government leadership expected the Deputy Minister
<br>to be fired. Kirchner did not speak to him for two weeks,
<br>until he unexpectedly called him asking for some trout for a
<br>dinner that Kirchner was hosting. Acevedo said this
<br>individual had a reputation for knowing where to get the best
<br>trout in Rio Gallegos. The Deputy Minister complied with the
<br>request, and two days later Kirchner invited him for coffee.
<br>Kirchner greeted him warmly, thanked him for the trout, and
<br>proceeded to chat with him for a long period, as if the
<br>previous incident had never happened, to the shock of
<br>everyone else present, including the Deputy Minister. In the
<br>end, the Deputy Minister was not fired, and Kirchner did not
<br>raise the issue again.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Kirchner's health condition exacerbates, and perhaps
<br>helps define, Kirchner's emotions and psychology. President
<br>Kirchner has reportedly suffered from irritable bowel
<br>syndrome for many years. According to the American Medical
<br>Association, the psychological effects of this condition
<br>leads those who suffer from it to be "often rigid, methodical
<br>persons who are conscientious, with obsessive-compulsive
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00001462 004 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>tendencies." Kirchner also reportedly works himself to
<br>exhaustion and needs to take frequent vacations to recover.
<br>The AMA further states "Psychologic and social stresses are
<br>often present in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and
<br>may be related in a temporal sense to the exacerbation of
<br>symptoms." This may account for Kirchner's lack of attention
<br>to protocol that involves long ceremonies or tight schedules,
<br>where Kirchner would not have quick access to a bathroom.
<br>
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>FOREIGN POLICY NOT KIRCHNER'S FOCUS
<br>-----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Foreign policy in the Kirchner government is always
<br>subservient to domestic political considerations. Kirchner,
<br>at least initially, took a hard line on the paper mills
<br>dispute with Uruguay -- despite the damage to Mercosur and
<br>regional relations -- because of the strong Argentine public
<br>concern about the paper mills, particularly in
<br>ruling-party-run Entre Rios province that is on the opposite
<br>side of the river from the plants. Kirchner's explicit and
<br>harsh criticism of the U.S. during his speech during the
<br>Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata can only be
<br>understood in the context of dismal public perceptions of the
<br>U.S. and Kirchner's desire to appeal to his leftist political
<br>base (See Reftel E). Kirchner's hardball tactics during
<br>negotiations over Argentina's private sector debt and his
<br>criticism of foreign companies that run major enterprises
<br>that were privatized in the 1990s do not earn him any support
<br>from foreign investors, but are popular with the Argentine
<br>public. Likewise, Kirchner cut Argentine gas exports to
<br>Chile in 2005 to cover shortages in the internal market
<br>despite the existence of valid contracts between Chile and
<br>local gas suppliers.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) President Kirchner is not skilled at international
<br>diplomacy and often ignores basic protocol. Kirchner's
<br>gaffes with foreign dignitaries are legendary. In June 2004,
<br>Kirchner left Russian leader Vladimir Putin waiting at the
<br>Moscow airport for a meeting that never happened, reportedly
<br>because Cristina Kirchner wanted to spend more time shopping
<br>at their previous stop in Prague. The GOA claimed that "bad
<br>weather" had delayed their takeoff when weather reports
<br>showed sunny conditions in Prague. Later that year,
<br>President Kirchner failed to attend a state dinner he was
<br>supposed to host for visiting Vietnamese President Tran Duc
<br>Luong. In like fashion, Kirchner failed to attend a
<br>reception in honor of the State visit of Queen Beatriz of
<br>Holland in March of 2006. Kirchner also never receives new
<br>Ambassadors, as state protocol would dictate, relegating this
<br>responsibility to Vice President Daniel Scioli.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Kirchner relies on an ever-shrinking group of
<br>long-time advisors to make key decisions, many of whom lack
<br>international, business and economic expertise (See Reftel
<br>D). No one from the Foreign Ministry is part of Kirchner's
<br>inner circle of advisors, and very few of Kirchner's close
<br>associates had overseas experience before Kirchner became
<br>President (See Reftel F). As a result, Kirchner often
<br>receives poor advice on international issues, such as when
<br>Legal and Technical Secretary Carlos Zannini reportedly
<br>convinced Kirchner that taking a tough line publicly on
<br>counter terrorism would, in the eyes of the USG, compensate
<br>for being critical of the U.S. in other areas and opposing
<br>the FTAA at the Summit of the Americas (See Reftel E).
<br>
<br>------------------------------------
<br>COMMENT -- IMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S.
<br>------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Kirchner's peculiar operating and decision-making
<br>style defines Argentine policymaking, and in the coming year,
<br>may lead to more challenges in the U.S.-Argentine
<br>relationship, as Kirchner focuses on shoring up his
<br>center-left political base for the 2007 elections. Given
<br>poll numbers that show Argentines have the least positive
<br>view of the U.S. out of all nations in the region, the U.S.
<br>will be a convenient target for Kirchner. As during the 2003
<br>presidential campaign, Kirchner will likely portray himself
<br>
<br>BUENOS AIR 00001462 005 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>as the lone true defender of Argentina in the world
<br>community. The Casa Rosada has reportedly already begun an
<br>effort to link Roberto Lavagna to the U.S., for example by
<br>encouraging press articles that the U.S. approved and is
<br>sponsoring a potential Lavagna campaign for President.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Kirchner has a history of using international
<br>disputes, like the paper mill conflict with Uruguay, to gain
<br>domestic popular support. We have been told by our British
<br>colleagues that relations between the U.K. and Argentina are
<br>at their lowest point in 15 years because Kirchner has chosen
<br>a confrontational attitude with the U.K. on the Falkland
<br>Islands dispute, thereby making political use of an issue
<br>that is at the core of Argentine national identity. As
<br>leading political analyst Rosendo Fraga told Poloff, "This
<br>year, Kirchner will use the U.K. and Uruguay as targets, and
<br>next year, it will be the U.S." Kirchner has been described
<br>to us by his close associates as someone who constantly
<br>focuses on the costs and benefits of his political decisions.
<br>During a recent trip to Spain, Kirchner criticized the
<br>U.S.'s "absence" and lack of significant assistance to the
<br>region. Former Minister Lavagna told the Ambassador that
<br>Kirchner did this in order to counter the image that he had
<br>been too forthcoming with Spanish multinationals during the
<br>trip. As the 2007 presidential campaign approaches, we
<br>cannot rule out occasional anti-U.S. diatribes by Kirchner in
<br>order to placate his leftist supporters.
