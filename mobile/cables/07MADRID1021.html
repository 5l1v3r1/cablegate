<br>
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Dear Secretary Rice: I welcome you to Spain on behalf
<br>of our 367 American and Spanish colleagues serving the United
<br>States at Mission Spain. Your visit is a milestone in our
<br>work, together with you, to overcome the differences over
<br>Iraq with the Spanish government and convince them that
<br>further strengthening cooperation coincides with Spain,s
<br>national interest. At the same time, your visit can serve as
<br>a catalyst to encourage Spain to become an even more active
<br>)- but responsible -- member of a Transatlantic partnership,
<br>marked by cooperative efforts on our shared values, including
<br>counter-terrorism and promoting democracy, freedom and human
<br>rights throughout the world. This means that you will need
<br>to speak frankly to the Spanish government about Cuba,
<br>despite their desire to avoid the issue. The issue need not
<br>be the central one in a rich agenda on a wide variety of
<br>fronts in which we work closely with Spain; however, Cuba
<br>must be an element of your discussions on democracy, and
<br>Spain,s own special responsibility as a democracy leader
<br>that has successfully undergone the transition from
<br>dictatorship to thriving democracy. Your discussions will
<br>also include Kosovo, Afghanistan, Spain,s OSCE Chairmanship,
<br>Russia, Iran, Iraq, Latin America and the Middle East.
<br>Moratinos will raise a thorny child-custody case involving a
<br>Spanish woman currently jailed for contempt of court in New
<br>Jersey. Your interview with the Spanish press will provide
<br>an opportunity to reach out to the Spanish people and
<br>underscore the significant value of our alliance and convey
<br>our views on issues on which we differ. We see this visit as
<br>a great opportunity to advance our relations with Spain, and
<br>the Spanish government shares this view. END SUMMARY
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The Spanish government has long awaited your first
<br>visit as Secretary of State and views it as a sign of the
<br>importance of strong U.S.-Spain relations. They will use your
<br>visit to counter criticism that the Zapatero government has
<br>shattered the transatlantic relationship. Per the Spain
<br>strategy you approved two years ago, we have sought to move
<br>this government away from visceral and reflexive anti-U.S.
<br>policies and sentiments, carving out areas in which
<br>Zapatero,s government can offer support for the President,s
<br>broad global agenda. We have made clear to the Zapatero
<br>government that the price of our willingness to publicly
<br>promote good bilateral relations is real contributions on
<br>world issues. While we have made some positive headway, the
<br>Zapatero government has not hesitated on occasion to pursue
<br>an agenda counter to our own when deemed in the Socialist
<br>party,s domestic political interest. Your visit should
<br>encourage Spain to be an even more active member of a
<br>transatlantic partnership that works cooperatively in pursuit
<br>of shared values on freedom, democracy, human rights and
<br>development.
<br>
<br>What is Working
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) On the positive side over the past two years, Spain
<br>contributed $22 million to the Basrah Children,s Hospital
<br>and offered a further $28 million in new money at the recent
<br>Iraq Compact meeting. The Zapatero government established a
<br>robust presence in Afghanistan that includes allowing the
<br>Spanish military to lead a PRT and co-lead a Forward Support
<br>Base in Western Afghanistan. Spain has contributed some 150
<br>million Euros in Afghan reconstruction funds. Spain also has
<br>1100 troops deployed along the Lebanon-Syria-Israel border as
<br>part of UNIFIL. The government allowed a sale of military
<br>aircraft to Venezuela to die. They support Turkey,s
<br>membership in the EU and have said that they will not pose
<br>problems on Missile Defense. We have superb two-way
<br>cooperation on counter-terrorism, counternarcotics,
<br>non-proliferation and military issues. This includes the use
<br>of two vital bases in southern Spain near the Straits of
<br>Gibraltar, where we maintain over 2000 personnel that serve
<br>as major logistical hubs for the flow of troops and materiel
<br>into the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters. The GOS also very
<br>much appreciates US coordination with Spain on Western
<br>Sahara, since Spain sees near-by North Africa as vital to its
<br>national security interests.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) In addition, our economic relationship with Spain is
<br>strong and mutually beneficial. The Spanish economy has
<br>boomed in the last decade as a result of structural reforms,
<br>EU aid, and membership in the Euro zone. The commercial
<br>relationship is dominated by a very strong U.S. direct
<br>investment presence, although two-way trade remains a
<br>relatively minor percentage of each country,s exports and
<br>imports. Many of the U.S. Fortune 100 firms are present and
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001021 002 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>doing well. The American Chamber of Commerce estimates that
<br>about five percent of Spain,s annual GDP comes from U.S.
<br>investment. In recent years, U.S. portfolio investors have
<br>bought significant shares in major Spanish firms. Spanish
<br>firms have rediscovered America and are now investing in the
<br>United States, especially in the banking and renewable energy
<br>sectors, and Spanish construction companies have also won
<br>important contracts in the U.S.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Spain cooperates closely with the United States in the
<br>fight against terrorism finance, co-chairing the Financial
<br>Action Task Force with us. Following intensive intervention
<br>by the USG and private industry, the Spanish government is
<br>giving increased attention to intellectual property rights
<br>issues. Other areas where we work closely with the Spanish
<br>include NASA,s Deep Space Network, and close partnerships in
<br>port security programs such as Megaports and the Container
<br>Security Initiative.
<br>
<br>What Still Needs Work
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) However, our challenge has been to channel the efforts
<br>of a unpredictable Spanish Foreign Minister who portrays
<br>himself as a self-styled &bridge8 between the U.S. and
<br>difficult world players--such as Syria, Cuba, Iran and some
<br>Palestinian elements. Additionally, President Zapatero plays
<br>to a largely leftist, pacifist support base, and uses foreign
<br>policy to win domestic political points rather than giving
<br>attention to core foreign policy priorities or embracing
<br>broader strategic goals.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) This has lent an erratic &zig-zag8 quality to the
<br>bilateral relationship. Moratinos, recent visit to Cuba
<br>highlighted the difficulty of maintaining a smooth and stable
<br>pattern as did his earlier outreach to Syria and Iran.
<br>Zapatero,s reversal of his Defense Minister,s commitment to
<br>deploy 150 troops to staff the ISAF XI headquarters reflects
<br>PSOE,s increasing sensitivity to Spanish public concerns
<br>about growing dangers in Afghanistan during this highly
<br>charged political season here ) with local/regional
<br>elections May 27 and national elections by March 2008.
<br>Kosovo independence is a sensitive issue for the GOS, which
<br>maintains troops in KFOR, because of concern about the impact
<br>of such an evolution on Spain,s own complex federal vs.
<br>regional struggle. For this reason, a UNSC Resolution
<br>explicitly authorizing independence will be essential for
<br>Spain to maintain its troops there.
<br>
<br>Proposed policy agenda
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) We want to challenge the Zapatero government to do
<br>better in the U.S.-Spain relationship as a result of your
<br>visit. In your meetings with King Juan Carlos, Zapatero and
<br>Moratinos, we suggest you frame our goals with Spain over the
<br>following months along several interrelated themes that make
<br>clear the need to act responsibly in NATO, Latin America and
<br>the Middle East in order to be seen as a reliable partner.
<br>We suggest the following themes:
<br>
<br>--Spain should work more closely in coordination with us in
<br>Europe and around the world on the freedom or democracy
<br>agenda. Spain has achieved a remarkable transformation since
<br>the end of dictatorship 30 years ago. It is one of the
<br>leading democracies in Europe and has the 8th largest economy
<br>in the world. Spain is now an active player in Europe, Latin
<br>America and the Middle East, including Iran. But Spain needs
<br>to act in concert with the EU, NATO and the U.S. on key
<br>issues. There is too much at stake for Spanish freelancing,
<br>as in the Middle East, Cuba and Russia. The transatlantic
<br>community needs Spain,s support on Kosovo, Missile Defense,
<br>NATO transformation, and Iran. The price of leadership and
<br>respect, which Spain seems to desire, is the willingness to
<br>devote the resources, assume responsibility, share burdens
<br>and act jointly with other powers. We welcome Spain,s
<br>commitment to stay the course in the pivotal struggle in
<br>Afghanistan. We know it is a delicate political issue in
<br>this electoral season but it is the right thing to do and a
<br>responsible policy. Spain,s OSCE chairmanship is important
<br>on all of these issues and we want to ensure close
<br>consultations so that Russian attempts to weaken key OSCE
<br>functions are curtailed.
<br>
<br>--Spain needs to help in countering anti-Americanism by
<br>publicly emphasizing cooperation. The U.S. and Spain
<br>cooperate on a myriad of issues that matter to the Spanish
<br>people, including the fight against terrorism and
<br>international organized crime, Middle East, North Africa,
<br>human rights and support for democracy. We urge the Spanish
<br>government to work with us to allay anti-American sentiments
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001021 003 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>in Spain, not just cooperate with us behind the scenes.
<br>Spain,s changing population and proximity to North Africa
<br>make it a prime target of Islamic extremism regardless of its
<br>relationship with the U.S. It is essential that we emphasize
<br>our shared values of democracy, human rights, freedom and
<br>opportunity for immigrants. Furthermore, during this
<br>difficult election period, we do not want our bilateral
<br>relations to become a casualty of the political crossfire. We
<br>understand electoral politics, but not at our expense.
<br>
<br>--Spain should capitalize on its role as a democratic leader.
<br>The U.S. welcomes Spain,s contributions on Afghanistan and
<br>Iraq, defense ties and counter-terrorism; these form the
<br>basis of our good bilateral relations. Spain,s success in
<br>the transition from dictatorship to thriving democracy makes
<br>it a worldwide leader in the areas of democracy-building and
<br>institution-building. Spain should deploy that expertise
<br>more actively in concert with our shared goals. Our respect
<br>for Spain,s exemplary democratic transition makes it all the
<br>more perplexing and disconcerting that Spain has embarked
<br>upon a policy of outreach to the Raul Castro regime,
<br>validating his succession with no clear message about the
<br>need for democratic transition. Nevertheless, we want to
<br>continue working with Spain in support of human rights and
<br>market-based economic policies in Latin America, including
<br>Cuba, and we urge Spain,s leadership to act in more positive
<br>ways and to demonstrate publicly Spain,s own values.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) We believe that folding our concerns about recent
<br>Spanish foreign policy moves into a broader, positive agenda
<br>can help advance our goals as we navigate the waters of a
<br>very difficult and volatile political season in Spain.
<br>
<br>The Political Environment
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) You arrive just after the May 27 regional and local
<br>elections. Current polls show that the results will likely
<br>provide momentum for both Zapatero,s Socialist Party and
<br>Mariano Rajoy,s Popular Party going into national elections
<br>by March 2008. In the regional elections, the Socialists
<br>could gain seats and join in coalition governments in three
<br>current PP regions. With Socialist victories in several
<br>regions last year, Zapatero could have a strong base of
<br>support going into the national elections. However, the PP
<br>is expected to strengthen its support in its traditional
<br>regional strongholds. On the national level, while support
<br>for Zapatero has diminished since its peak after the March
<br>2004 elections, Rajoy has not been able to capitalize and his
<br>ratings remain low and are falling.
<br>
<br>Assessment of Zapatero
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Though polls show Zapatero,s support down from the
<br>high just following the March 2004 elections and considerable
<br>concern about his ETA policies, he stands a good chance of
<br>surviving national elections in early 2008, albeit with some
<br>of his support drifting to smaller, leftist parties in the
<br>Parliament.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Zapatero focuses almost exclusively on domestic
<br>policy; his foreign policy instincts are governed by the
<br>exigencies of their domestic political impact. With a largely
<br>left of center, pacifist public which is strongly opposed to
<br>the Iraq war, the Aznar government and Bush Administration
<br>policies, Zapatero loses nothing by taking the U.S. to task
<br>on key issues. However, Zapatero now recognizes that the
<br>Spanish public believes that Spain,s leaders must maintain
<br>good relations with the U.S. After his first volatile year
<br>in office, he has sought to improve the tenor and substance
<br>of U.S.-Spain relations while still maintaining the
<br>politically acceptable policy of offering criticism of U.S.
<br>policies as part of the role of what he calls a &loyal
<br>ally.8 We suggest you encourage Zapatero to continue to view
<br>a positive agenda with the U.S. as a necessary element of his
<br>political strategy and emphasize that the U.S. will not keep
<br>silent when his government pursues policies that run counter
<br>to our shared values and interests.
<br>
<br>Rajoy as PP leader
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Your meeting with PP leader Mariano Rajoy will be
<br>interpreted in Spain as a symbol of continued U.S. ties with
<br>a partner that supports U.S. foreign policy goals. However,
<br>we need to make clear to Rajoy that the U.S. will continue to
<br>work with the current government as long as it is in power
<br>because of our major long-term interests in Spain, including
<br>in the war on terrorism and in Afghanistan. The Spanish
<br>media will scrutinize the length of your meeting with Rajoy
<br>in comparison with your session with Zapatero for signs of
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001021 004 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>any political signals we are trying to send.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Recent polls indicate that Rajoy thus far has not
<br>been able to galvanize support for his candidacy for Spain,s
<br>Presidency, despite some very meaty issues that could be
<br>developed to the PP,s advantage. One of the most crucial of
<br>these controversial issues is Zapatero,s policy toward the
<br>Basque terrorist group ETA, which the PP viscerally opposes
<br>and which has driven hundreds of thousands of protesters into
<br>the streets. The PP points to the December 30 attack at the
<br>Madrid airport which killed two Ecuadorian citizens as proof
<br>that ETA will not renounce violence. The PP remains strong in
<br>its traditional strongholds, however, and the ETA issue has
<br>become increasingly worrisome to a number of Spaniards.
<br>However, recent polls show that Rajoy himself has not
<br>galvanized support for his candidacy for Spain,s Presidency.
<br>If PP turns out a large number of voters for the regional
<br>and local elections, Rajoy nonetheless will come to your
<br>meeting buoyed with the hope of a strong challenge to
<br>Zapatero in the national elections. Bitterness over the March
<br>11 terrorist attacks and the Aznar government,s handling of
<br>the issue, however, remains a liability for Rajoy, and
<br>Spanish politics at the national level are bitter and
<br>divided.
<br>
<br>Role of the King
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Your meeting with King Juan Carlos will demonstrate
<br>U.S. respect for the Spanish state and its people. Though
<br>prohibited from playing a direct role in foreign policy, Juan
<br>Carlos has helped behind the scenes. For example, he helped
<br>smooth relations with the U.S. after tensions in the months
<br>following the 2004 Spanish elections. In November of that
<br>year, President and Mrs. Bush invited the King and Queen for
<br>a pre-Thanksgiving lunch at Crawford, which was widely
<br>interpreted here as a sign of respect for the Spanish state.
<br>Juan Carlos is well versed on foreign policy issues and will
<br>welcome your review of the key issues you plan to discuss
<br>with Zapatero and Moratinos. He should also hear our strong
<br>concerns on issues like Cuba and Syria. On a personal note,
<br>you might congratulate the King on the birth of Crown Prince
<br>Felipe,s second daughter, Sofia, born on April 29, 2007.
<br>
<br>Dealing with Moratinos
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) We no longer hear last year,s rumors of Moratinos,
<br>imminent departure from his post as Foreign Minister and he
<br>seems entrenched in his position. He seeks a role on the
<br>world stage andtries to capitalize on his old ties in the
<br>Middle East, as well as Spain,s presence in Lebanon and
<br>Afghanistan, to play a role on Israel-Palestinian issues,
<br>Lebanon, Syria and Iran. We have sought to find ways to keep
<br>Moratinos in contact with senior USG officials on a range of
<br>issues as a means to help channel his efforts. Spain,s
<br>chairmanship of the OSCE puts Moratinos in the unusual
<br>position of having a voice and interest in core transatlantic
<br>issues related to Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and the
<br>Caucasus. Moratinos, penchant for trying to &mediate8
<br>needs to be tamed as Russia issues come to the fore; we have
<br>already seen evidence of Spain,s willingness to try to
<br>excuse or mitigate Russia,s recent threats to cut off CFE.
<br>Moratinos has denied that his comments that he supports
<br>Missile Defense discussion in the OSCE, but Russian Embassy
<br>contacts have told us that Moratinos supports the idea.
<br>
<br>¶17. (C) Moratinos' recent trip to Cuba is one of the most
<br>prominent of Moratinos, miscalculations with the U.S. In
<br>addition to private protestations, I published an op-ed in
<br>Spain,s leftist daily newspaper El Pais, laying out U.S.
<br>goals for democracy in Cuba. He has pushed the Human Rights
<br>dialogue promised during his visit so that it could take
<br>place just before your visit to Madrid. Moratinos will argue
<br>this justifies his Cuba policy. However, your visit should
<br>make clear to Moratinos the harm his trip has done to this
<br>effort, an objective he and Zapatero continually claim they
<br>share with us. Moratinos wants your brief bilateral before
<br>the working luncheon to be kept to a small group, where he
<br>wants to corral the issues of Cuba, Kosovo and Afghanistan
<br>(his proposal for an international neighbors conference).
<br>These are the three issues he deems most sensitive from the
<br>Spanish side. In your working luncheon, issues will including
<br>US-Spain bilateral relations (including excellent
<br>counter-terrorism, defense, non-proliferation cooperation);
<br>Transatlantic issues, including Spain,s Chairmanship of the
<br>OSCE, Russia and Moscow,s proposals for OSCE to discuss
<br>Missile Defense, to Russia (Missile Defense); and finally,
<br>Latin America, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and the Middle East peace
<br>process. Iran will be in the Spanish news during your visit;
<br>while you are here, Larijani may be meeting with Solana at a
<br>
<br>MADRID 00001021 005 OF 005
<br>
<br>
<br>location organized by the Spanish. Moratinos will also want
<br>to discuss the way forward on Western Sahara, and he is
<br>pleased at our cooperation in security the latest MINURSO
<br>resolution calling for direct talks between Morocco and the
<br>Polisario.
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Two important bilateral issues fall in the judicial
<br>area. Moratinos has said he will raise with you the child
<br>custody involving Spanish citizen Maria Jos Carrascosa who
<br>is currently jailed for contempt of court in Bergen County,
<br>New Jersey for failure to return her child to the US as
<br>required by a New Jersey court decision. During this
<br>political season in Madrid, the case has become a cause
<br>celebre, with pictures of Carrascosa ) viewed as a mother
<br>separated from her child - in handcuffs entering the New
<br>Jersey prison. The GOS agrees that this is a case for the
<br>courts and both governments agree that mediation of the
<br>dispute is the appropriate response. However, Moratinos for
<br>political reasons has to show the government is doing
<br>something about the case. On our side, you should note
<br>continued USG concern about the court case against the three
<br>US servicemen charged with alleged &war crimes8 in the case
<br>of the death of Spanish TV camerman Jose Couse in the
<br>Palestine Hotel in Baghdad in 2003. The GOS has been helpful
<br>behind the scenes in getting the case appealed by the Spanish
<br>Prosecutor. The case now moves to the appeals tribunal of
<br>the National Court, which will rule on the substance of the
<br>charges. We want continued vigilance and cooperation by the
<br>GOS until the case is dropped.
<br>
<br>¶19. (C) Moratinos holds you in very high regard and values
<br>the contacts that he has had with you. Your efforts and
<br>those of other senior USG officials, along with mine, to help
<br>guide Moratinos on key issues such as handling Russia in the
<br>OSCE and on the full range of Middle East issues, can prove
<br>effective. The more outreach the better, as we try to play
<br>to his desire to have a role on major issues while helping to
<br>direct some of these efforts toward policies that work to
<br>support US global objectives.
<br>
<br>¶20. (U) You may want to congratulate Moratinos on the
<br>upcoming celebration of the 50th anniversary of the
<br>Commission for Cultural, Educational and Scientific Exchange
<br>between the United States and Spain (the Fulbright
<br>Commission) and express how you look forward to hearing more
<br>about the events planned to take place in Washington to
<br>commemorate this major milestone. The Spanish Fulbright
<br>Commission, the second largest in Europe, is a truly
<br>binational organization with the majority of funding provided
<br>by the Spanish central government, as well as regional
<br>autonomous communities and private sector entities.
<br>
<br>¶21. (C) In all, you will find a rich agenda with Spain, which
<br>your visit can advance substantially. Again, welcome to
<br>Madrid. We are looking forward to your visit on June 1.
