<br>Office, DOS. 
<br>REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Oppositionist hopes that Iran's clerical class 
<br>would mobilize to oppose Supreme Leader Khamenei's post-election 
<br>policies appear sharply diminished in the wake of the first 
<br>Assembly of Experts meeting since the June 12 Presidential 
<br>election. Not only did the Assembly, which has the power to 
<br>appoint, supervise and dismiss the Supreme Leader, give a 
<br>ringing endorsement of Khamenei's rule and his handling of the 
<br>post-election crisis, it did so in the conspicuous absence of 
<br>its Chair, Ayatollah Rafsanjani.  Moreover, leaks of the 
<br>closed-door proceedings to the conservative press indicate that 
<br>at least two prominent members of this clerical deliberative 
<br>body excoriated Rafsanjani for his failure to support Khamenei 
<br>during the unrest.  Despite his absence at the closure of the 
<br>Assembly of Experts meeting, Rafsanjani was compelled to 
<br>publicly endorse the closing statement while seated at the knee 
<br>of the Supreme Leader during a September 24 press conference. 
<br>END SUMMARY. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Assembly of Experts: A 'Deliberative' Body 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>2 (C) The Majles-e Khobregan, or Assembly of Experts (AOE), is a 
<br>Constitutionally-mandated deliberative body composed of 86 
<br>directly-elected senior clerics from across the country.  By 
<br>law, the Assembly must meet for a minimum of two days twice a 
<br>year.  Though theoretically vested with the power to appoint, 
<br>supervise and dismiss the Supreme Leader, in practical terms the 
<br>Assembly's only real responsibility is to appoint the Supreme 
<br>Leader's successor should he die or become incapacitated.  As 
<br>such, the AOE's last noteworthy act was appointing current 
<br>Supreme Leader Khamenei after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1989 
<br>death.  Every subsequent meeting has ended with the issuance of 
<br>a perfunctory statement lauding the Assembly's decision to 
<br>appoint Khamenei and praising his leadership. Nevertheless, 
<br>according to Article 111 of the Constitution, the Assembly can 
<br>find Khamenei unfit for office; accordingly, control of the AOE 
<br>remains a (potential) check on the Supreme Leader's otherwise 
<br>unbridled power. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) The Assembly is currently chaired by Ayatollah Ali Akbar 
<br>Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was re-elected to the two-year term of 
<br>Speaker in March 2009.  At the time of his re-election, he 
<br>garnered 51 votes, an improvement over the 46 votes he received 
<br>in 2007, despite efforts by hardline conservative clerics, led 
<br>by Ayatollahs Mesbah-Yazdi and Ibrahim Yazdi, to unseat him. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>First Meeting since the Election 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) On September 22-23 the AOE convened for the first time 
<br>since Iran's disputed June 12 election.  Rafsanjani opened the 
<br>sixth official meeting of this Fourth Assembly of Experts by 
<br>again cautioning that a "suspicious faction" is trying to create 
<br>rifts among Iran's leaders and by condemning the "atmosphere of 
<br>insults and dispute" that has prevailed since the June 
<br>presidential election.  He also promised that "system insiders 
<br>of good will" are developing a plan to resolve Iran's domestic 
<br>political problems. His opening statement was followed by 
<br>reports to the body by Judiciary deputy Mohsen Ejei 
<br>(Intelligence Minister during the presidential election and its 
<br>aftermath) and Revolutionary Guards Commander Jaafari. 
<br>According to press reports, at least sixteen Assembly members 
<br>spoke. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Though summaries of the closed-door proceedings released 
<br>by Rafsanjani's office did not reflect any discord among the 
<br>members and indeed indicated the body's support of him, 
<br>conservative Iranian press charged Rafsanjani's office with 
<br>'censoring' coverage of the proceeding, reporting that at least 
<br>two prominent members sharply criticized Rafsanjani for failing 
<br>to support the Supreme Leader after the disputed election.  One 
<br>quotation prominently featured in conservative news outlets was 
<br>Mashhad Friday Prayer Leader Ayatollah al-Hoda rhetorically 
<br>asking Rafsanjani, "why after twenty years, have you remained 
<br>silent in the face of these unprecedented insults (to the 
<br>Supreme Leader)?" 
<br> 
<br>DUBAI 00000389  002.2 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) More tellingly, Rafsanjani did not attend the second and 
<br>final day of the meeting, with recently retired former Judiciary 
<br>Head Ayatollah Shahrudi chairing in his absence. Hardline 
<br>conservative Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami (the same cleric who 
<br>replaced Rafsanjani as Qods Day prayer leader - reftel) read the 
<br>Assembly's final statement, which was an unqualified if not 
<br>fawning endorsement of the Supreme Leader himself and his "wise 
<br>policies" for quickly extinguishing the post-election "flames of 
<br>sedition."  Khatami noted that Rafsanjani, despite his absence, 
<br>agreed with "every point" of the final statement, which also 
<br>credited Khamenei for dismissing the fraud allegations as part 
<br>of a plot to undermine the Islamic Republic.  The final 
<br>statement was also noteworthy in its perfunctory congratulations 
<br>to President Ahmadinejad for his election victory, and its more 
<br>sincere admonishment of Ahmadinejad to scrupulously follow 
<br>Supreme Leader Khamenei's guidance. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) COMMENT: Following the disputed June 12 presidential 
<br>election, many speculated that the axis of a Rafsanjani 
<br>counter-attack would focus on rallying clerical support to his 
<br>cause. However, the rumored AOE "emergency session" never 
<br>convened, and absent such a meeting it remained unclear how much 
<br>support Rafsanjani had among this body that reflects the 
<br>political leanings of Iran's traditional senior clergy.  Now 
<br>that the AOE has met, it is clear that the clerical cavalry 
<br>isn't coming over the horizon anytime soon.  Furthermore, the 
<br>AOE final statement, seen in conjunction with the removal of 
<br>Rafsanjani as Qods Day Speaker (reftel), indicates in the 
<br>clearest terms yet that in the most severe crisis of his career, 
<br>Rafsanjani is unable to mobilize his once vast and influential 
<br>patronage network to achieve his political ends.  And given that 
<br>Rafsanjani's presumed power is serving as at least a partial 
<br>deterrent to further regime moves against Mousavi, Karrubi and 
<br>Khatami, the results of this two-day AOE session bode ill for 
<br>the leadership of the oppositionist "Green Path of Hope."  END 
<br>COMMENT.
