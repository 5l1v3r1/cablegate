<br>SUBJECT: PAKISTAN'S PARLIAMENT BEGINS TERRORISM DEBATE
<br>
<br>Classified By: CDA Jerry Feierstein, for reasons 1.4 (b)(d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary. The October 8-9 closed joint session of
<br>parliament convoked by President Zardari to address the
<br>security situation has been widely praised as a good first
<br>step in convincing Pakistan's elected leadership to take
<br>ownership of the fight against extremism; this effort now
<br>should be extended to reach the general public. Director
<br>General of Military Operations LtGen Pasha's briefing to the
<br>group consisted largely of graphic video and other footage
<br>demonstrating what one parliamentarian called the inhumane
<br>and anti-Islamic nature of the militants. Pasha reportedly
<br>blamed India, Russia and the UAE for supporting Baloch and
<br>Taliban militancy and defended Pakistani sovereignty against
<br>incursions by U.S. forces, but reportedly he also spoke
<br>positively about what he termed the U.S. use of drones,
<br>noting the vast majority of those killed in drone attacks
<br>were foreign fighters or Taliban.
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The joint session has been extended by another four
<br>days, beginning October 13 when Information Minister Sherry
<br>Rehman will present the GOP's strategy to fight extremism.
<br>The session increasingly promises to be a lively debate with
<br>the Interior, Defense, Finance and Foreign Affairs Ministers
<br>lined up to answer parliamentarians' questions. NSA Durrani
<br>shared with Charge October 10 a draft of that presentation
<br>that follows classic counter-insurgency strategy. It does
<br>say the GOP has not given the U.S. a green light to do
<br>cross-border operations, but uses that as a launching pad to
<br>attack the presence of foreign militants and their violations
<br>of Pakistani sovereignty. It goes on to call on the tribes
<br>to eject the foreigners and support the government and offers
<br>them development assistance if they come around.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Nawaz
<br>Sharif attended the briefing but left it to his Opposition
<br>Leader Chaudhry Nisar to criticize the government, mostly on
<br>procedural terms so far, by demanding that the civilian
<br>government explain their strategy and how it differs from
<br>that of the former Musharraf government. End Summary.
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) President Asif Zardari convoked a joint session of
<br>parliament on October 8 to be briefed by the military on the
<br>current security situation. This was the third time in
<br>Pakistan's history that a joint session of parliament was
<br>formed as a committee of the whole to hear outside testimony
<br>(the first was in 1974 to discuss religious riots; the second
<br>was in 1988 to debate whether to sign the Geneva peace accord
<br>on Afghanistan). Chief of Army Staff General Kayani attended
<br>but newly promoted LtGeneral Pasha delivered the military's
<br>brief as Director General of Military Operations (Pasha moved
<br>over to become Director of Inter-Services Intelligence on
<br>October 10).
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Lending a sense of urgency to the proceedings, on
<br>October 9, suicide bombers attacked an Anti-Terrorism Unit of
<br>Islamabad Police injuring a dozen and set off a roadside bomb
<br>in Dir, Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) killing 12. Also
<br>on October 9, a bearded man in a burqa was arrested at
<br>Islamabad airport on suspicion of terrorism; across Pakistan
<br>there have been numerous hoax bomb threats since the
<br>September 20 Marriott bombing. On October 10, over 60 (the
<br>death toll is still rising) members of an anti-Taliban jirga
<br>were killed in Orakzai, Federally Administered Tribal Areas
<br>(FATA), and in Bajaur, FATA, the Taliban beheaded four elders
<br>of the Charmang tribe. Also on October 10, the Taliban blew
<br>up the house of another Awami National Party leader in Dir
<br>and kidnapped a nazim (mayor) in Swat, NWFP. Earlier in the
<br>week, explosions at several juice shops in Lahore were
<br>blamed, not on the Taliban, but on conservative groups
<br>reportedly seeking to discourage "immoral" behavior (the bars
<br>were allegedly trysting places for unmarried couples). These
<br>attacks followed the October 2 suicide bombing targeting
<br>Awami National Party leader Asfundyar Wali Khan in Wali Bagh,
<br>NWFP, and the October 7 attack on a Pakistan Muslim
<br>League-Nawaz parliamentarian in Bhakkar, Punjab. Overall,
<br>there have been 40 suicide bombings in Pakistan so far in
<br>¶2008. 
<br>¶6. (C) The joint session was held "in camera" without press
<br>but parliamentarians have been providing bits and pieces of
<br>information about the briefing, which was followed by a
<br>question and answer session. The original Q&A session,
<br>
<br>Islamabad 00003248 002 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>scheduled for 30 minutes, lasted over four hours. The
<br>parliament then convened in joint session on October 9 to
<br>continue questions; it agreed to meet for another four days
<br>beginning October 13, when Information Minister Sherry Rehman
<br>will brief the group on the Pakistan People's Party (PPP)
<br>strategy to tackle terrorism.
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx that Pasha's
<br>briefing consisted in large part of videos and photos of
<br>Taliban and other terrorist organization activities that
<br>demonstrated the militants were both inhumane and un-Islamic.
<br>At several points, xxxxxxxxxxxx said female parliamentarians asked
<br>the Army to stop showing disturbing footage, including a gory
<br>beheading. Members were told that India has established nine
<br>training camps along the Afghan border, where they are
<br>training members of the Baloch Liberation Army. According to
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx Pasha also claimed that India and the UAE (reportedly
<br>due to opposition to construction of the Gwadar port) were
<br>funding and arming the Baloch. Pasha also claimed that the
<br>Russian government was directly involved in
<br>funding/training/supporting the insurgency.
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx said Pasha briefed members on what he termed
<br>USG drone incursions and missile strikes. According to
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx , Pasha praised the U.S. for its support through these
<br>methods and showed statistics to parliamentarians that
<br>demonstrated the vast majority of those killed in these
<br>attacks were either foreign fighters or Taliban. xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>believed that the military had made a good-faith effort to
<br>portray USG activities as positive. According to xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>Pasha barely mentioned the threat from local Taliban leader,
<br>Baitullah Mehsud.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Other parliamentarians at a dinner hosted October 10
<br>by Charge for SCA/PB Director Hartley, including Pakistan
<br>People's Party (PPP) Senators Babar Awan and Enver Baig,
<br>Pakistan Muslim League Assembly member Donya Aziz, Awami
<br>National Party Senator Haji Muhammed Adeel, FATA
<br>parliamentarians Shaukat Ullah and Munir Khan Orakzai and
<br>Muttahdia Quami Movement (MQM) leader Farouq Sattar, were
<br>less impressed by Pasha's brief. They all said the brief was
<br>a good beginning, but characterized it as being largely
<br>descriptive and adding little information they did not
<br>already know. They noted that Pasha, unsurprisingly,
<br>defended Pakistan's sovereignty against U.S. incursions.
<br>They agreed that Pasha had defended Pakistan's relationship
<br>with the U.S. but did not share details from the briefing
<br>about foreign fighters killed in alleged U.S. drone attacks.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Both the FATA parliamentarians and MQM said during
<br>the Q&A session they pointed out that not all terrorists were
<br>tribals and that the GOP needed to address growing extremism
<br>in the Punjab. They noted that Punjabis increasingly are
<br>moving to fight with militants in FATA and that there is
<br>growing Talibanization of Karachi.
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Also attending the dinner was Pakistan Muslim
<br>League-Nawaz (PML-N) Information Secretary Ahsan Iqbal.
<br>Iqbal echoed comments made publicly by PML-N Opposition
<br>Leader Chaudhry Nisar; both denigrated the briefing as being
<br>merely descriptive and called for the civilian government to
<br>explain its strategy to fight the militants. Nisar asked how
<br>the GOP's strategy differed from that of the former Musharraf
<br>government. Nisar told the press "It is noteworthy that no
<br>suicide attack had taken place before the country became an
<br>ally of the U.S. in the war on terror." PML-N leader Ishak
<br>Dar told the press that it was imperative that a joint
<br>session of parliament be apprised of all agreements executed
<br>with the U.S. Interestingly, Nawaz Sharif, who attended the
<br>joint session, did not comment on it publicly. Several
<br>newspaper editorials criticized the PML-N leaders for jumping
<br>the gun on their criticism before the session was complete.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam leader Fazlur Rehman at a news
<br>conference October 12 claimed his party had the vision to
<br>lead the country of the present crisis. He blamed the entire
<br>military leadership, not just former President Musharraf, and
<br>demanded they explain the agreed-upon rules of engagement
<br>with U.S./ISAF coalition forces in Afghanistan. He
<br>reiterated his view that the U.S. presence in Afghanistan was
<br>the root cause of Pakistan's problems in the tribal areas and
<br>said foreign troops must leave Afghanistan for the sake of
<br>
<br>Islamabad 00003248 003 of 003
<br>
<br>
<br>peace in the region. He also said his party had serious
<br>reservations about the ongoing military operations in Bajaur.
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) The Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) party and the Pukhtunkhwa
<br>Milli Awami Party, both of which oppose use of force in the
<br>tribal areas, boycotted the session. JI leader Qazi Hussain
<br>has this week been leading a largely ignored "train march" to
<br>protest GOP policies in the FATA.
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) We expect Sherry Rehman will brief the now
<br>established GOP strategy of: (1) political engagement, but
<br>not with terrorists; (2) economic development; and (3) use of
<br>force when necessary. National Security Advisor Durrani
<br>provided Charge October 10 with a draft of the GOP's
<br>presentation to the joint body, which follows classic
<br>counter-insurgency strategy. It does say the GOP has not
<br>given the U.S. a green light to do cross-border operations,
<br>but uses that as a launching pad to attack the presence of
<br>foreign militants and their violations of Pakistani
<br>sovereignty. It goes on to call on the tribes to eject the
<br>foreigners and support the government and offers them
<br>development assistance if they come around.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) Comment: The long-promised joint session is a
<br>welcome first step in bringing Pakistan's elected leadership
<br>on board with the government's counter-terrorism strategy.
<br>The session is being extended to accommodate a great deal of
<br>pent-up opinion and emotion that has amassed over the past
<br>few years when the leadership kept parliament in the dark on
<br>security issues. The government understandably wants to keep
<br>as much of that emotion contained in a closed-door session as
<br>possible, and surprisingly little of the briefing content has
<br>been leaked to the press. At some point, however, there
<br>needs to be a public airing of views and concerns if the GOP
<br>is going to increase public acknowledgment that this is
<br>Pakistan's war.
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Comment cont'd: In other welcome developments, at
<br>least one Pakistani group (perhaps bankrolled by the owner of
<br>the bombed Marriott Hotel in Islamabad), Yeh Hum Naheen (Say
<br>No to Terrorism) has been placing newspaper and TV ads in the
<br>Urdu and English language press; the group's aim is to
<br>collect the largest number of signatures ever on an
<br>anti-terrorism petition. We understand the Information
<br>Ministry is responsible for placing other anti-terrorism ads
<br>in recent days. On October 11, Information Minister Malik
<br>spoke at an anti-terrorism seminar organized in Lahore, again
<br>as part of a long-promised outreach campaign by GOP ministers.
