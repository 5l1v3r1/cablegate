<br>SUBJECT: FRENCH NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR'S VIEWS ON MIDDLE 
<br>EAST 
<br> 
<br>REF: PARIS 170 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt, reasons 
<br>1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: French NSA-equivalent Maurice 
<br>Gourdault-Montagne (MGM) told the Ambassador on January 22 
<br>that "some" are calling for France to freeze plans for 
<br>establishing an international tribunal on Lebanon until next 
<br>autumn, in the hope that this delay would allow Lebanese PM 
<br>Siniora to break the political deadlock in Beirut.  MGM said 
<br>that President Chirac did not espouse a delay, but suggested 
<br>(more than once) that the Lebanese themselves might request 
<br>one.  Turning to Iran, he provided a somewhat unpersuasive 
<br>explanation of Chirac's rationale for contemplating the 
<br>dispatch of a high-level envoy to Tehran, saying such an 
<br>envoy might help to dispel misunderstandings of French policy 
<br>aims on a number of regional questions, and indicating that 
<br>he himself would not serve as an envoy to Tehran and neither 
<br>would FM Douste-Blazy.  On Iraq, MGM said that France wanted 
<br>to see Iraq serve once again as a buffer against Iranian 
<br>expansionism, but doubted that the West had sufficient 
<br>resources to end Iranian influence in Iraq while 
<br>simultaneously solving the country's economic problems.  On 
<br>Afghanistan, he reviewed the achievements of the Riga 
<br>Conference with satisfaction but said no European country was 
<br>prepared to send additional troops at this time. End summary. 
<br> 
<br>Lebanon: Putting the Tribunal on Ice 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (S) The Ambassador hosted French NSA-equivalent Maurice 
<br>Gourdault-Montagne (MGM) for breakfast on January 22.  MGM 
<br>cheerfully reviewed preparations for the January 25 Lebanon 
<br>Conference, saying France would announce a contribution of 
<br>500 million euros, while Germany would pledge somewhere in 
<br>the neighborhood of 80 million euros.  He observed with 
<br>pleasure that British FM Beckett was now planning to attend 
<br>(a reversal he gratefully attributed to U.S. encouragement). 
<br>The only disappointment, he said, was Russia, which would be 
<br>represented by Special Middle East Envoy Saltanov, even 
<br>though FM Lavrov's schedule could have permitted him to 
<br>attend at least the opening session. 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) MGM said he saw little chance of resolving Lebanon's 
<br>domestic political crisis prior to the Lebanese presidential 
<br>election in November 2007.  Consequently, some had raised the 
<br>idea of "putting the tribunal in the freezer" until that 
<br>time, in hopes that a delay in setting up the tribunal would 
<br>aid PM Siniora to break the political deadlock.  "Of course, 
<br>we (neither he nor Chirac) are not advocating this idea," MGM 
<br>stressed at several points.  Nevertheless, he continued, the 
<br>Lebanese themselves might ask the French and the U.S. to put 
<br>the tribunal on ice, in part because Siniora would need the 
<br>opposition's help in order to deliver the economic reforms 
<br>that the GOL is promising at this week's conference.  The 
<br>only other option, MGM continued, would be to change the 
<br>scope of the tribunal itself -- something France found 
<br>unacceptable.  When pressed on why the French were 
<br>contemplating a change in their approach to the tribunal at 
<br>this point -- especially when it was unclear that Lebanon's 
<br>opposition had the upper hand -- MGM made another (and 
<br>somewhat jumbled) reference to the need to obtain the 
<br>opposition's support for economic reform. 
<br> 
<br>Chirac's Iran Envoy: Is the Idea Dead or Not? 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) Turning to recent media reports concerning President 
<br>Chirac's plans to send a high level envoy to Iran, MGM said 
<br>he was strongly reminded of how a few years ago internal USG 
<br>discussion of possible changes in Iran policy had been leaked 
<br>to the Wall Street Journal, thereby killing the proposed 
<br>discussion before it had a chance to take place.  He said 
<br>Chirac's envoy proposal had suffered much the same fate after 
<br>those opposed to any change in the French approach to Iran 
<br>(MGM did not speculate on who they might be) leaked the 
<br>content of sensitive MFA-Elysee discussions to Le Monde. 
<br>(Although Le Monde approached him for comment before running 
<br>with the piece, MGM said the journalist already had "the 
<br>whole story.") 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) MGM acknowledged that the Elysee had two concerns 
<br>about sending an envoy to Tehran.  First, one could argue 
<br>(and Saudi King Abdallah did, in the strongest terms) that 
<br>sending an envoy to engage the Iranians on Lebanon would 
<br>merely consecrate Iran's role in Lebanon.  (The 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00000257  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>counterargument, MGM said, was that Iran's influence is a 
<br>fact, like it or not.)  The second concern was that the 
<br>Iranians might try to parley the overture into an invitation 
<br>to attend the January 25 Lebanon Conference.  "But even if 
<br>they had asked, we weren't going to invite them," MGM assured 
<br>the Ambassador. 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) As for the virtues of engaging with Tehran, MGM argued 
<br>that it would be useful to dispel Iranian misperceptions of 
<br>France's policy aims in the Middle East without engaging in a 
<br>debate on those aims.  Hence, Chirac had mulled the 
<br>possibility of arming his envoy with a letter to Supreme 
<br>Leader Khamenei, which would spell out France's position on 
<br>Israel (i.e., that it has a right to exist), on UNSCR 1701 
<br>(that all states are obligated to work toward its full 
<br>implementation), and on Iran's need to promote regional 
<br>stability (code for stop interfering in Iraq).  In addition, 
<br>Chirac and his advisors reasoned that an envoy's visit might 
<br>strengthen the hand of President Ahmadinejad's critics. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) MGM stressed that the idea of sending Foreign Minister 
<br>Douste-Blazy was no longer an option, not only because of the 
<br>Le Monde leak but also because of vehement opposition from 
<br>Saudi Arabia and Egypt.  MGM also made it clear that he 
<br>himself would not be an envoy to Tehran, given the likelihood 
<br>that the Iranians would try to oblige him to see President 
<br>Ahmadinejad (which neither Chirac nor his advisers will do, 
<br>given Ahmadinejad's public declarations on Israel).  However, 
<br>MGM did not categorically exclude the possibility that Chirac 
<br>would not send someone else (e.g., Jean-Claude Cousseran) as 
<br>an envoy. 
<br> 
<br>UNIFIL: A Solution on Drones? 
<br>----------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) MGM indicated that France was searching for a solution 
<br>to the problem of operating UAVs (i.e., "drones") over 
<br>southern Lebanon in the wake of recent statements by 
<br>Hizballah claiming that France would share with Israel any 
<br>intelligence collected by the drones.  MGM said France would 
<br>not allow Hizballah to draw red-lines impinging upon the 
<br>operations of French peacekeepers; Hizballah had attempted 
<br>this once before with respect to the deployment of Leclerc 
<br>tanks, and the French had deployed the tanks anyway. 
<br>However, he confirmed a difference of opinion between the 
<br>Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs: the military was 
<br>determined to operate the drones (which were shipped to 
<br>UNIFIL at the request of UNDPKO), whereas the diplomats 
<br>advised caution.  Consequently, MGM said the French were 
<br>leaning towards a "demonstration flight" held in the presence 
<br>of members of the Lebanese Armed Forces with "maximum 
<br>transparency" so that it would be clear to the Lebanese 
<br>public that the UAV flights would not be used as a source of 
<br>intelligence for Israel.  The final decision, he emphasized, 
<br>would only be made by Chirac himself. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) Noting that on the ground cooperation between Lebanese 
<br>civilians living in UNIFIL's area of operations and French 
<br>peacekeepers ended overnight following FM Douste-Blazy's 
<br>ill-considered declaration that Hizballah was an enemy to 
<br>France, MGM said France "must walk a fine line" while not 
<br>allowing Hizballah to dictate terms to UNIFIL.  If necessary, 
<br>France could reinforce its military presence by deploying the 
<br>second of two battalions pledged to UNIFIL last year.  MGM 
<br>confirmed that in February, the French would conduct a 
<br>6-month review of their participation in UNIFIL.  While he 
<br>foresaw no change in France's participation as a result of 
<br>this review, he conceded that any attack against French 
<br>peacekeepers would likely lead to further evaluation of 
<br>France's role.  Moreover, he admitted that the French are 
<br>deeply concerned that Hizballah might attempt to kidnap 
<br>French peacekeepers in the run-up to the French presidential 
<br>elections this Spring. 
<br> 
<br>Syria 
<br>----- 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) Noting ruefully that a velvet revolution does not 
<br>appear to be in prospect any time soon in Damascus, MGM 
<br>expressed mild concern over the future of France's Syria 
<br>policy once Chirac leaves office.  "Any new government will 
<br>be tempted to think that talking to the Syrians is the 
<br>answer," he said, adding that while Socialist Party candidate 
<br>Segolene Royal had indicated her agreement with the general 
<br>thrust of current French policy, Interior Minister Sarkozy 
<br>remained somewhat vague on the issue.  MGM noted that FM 
<br>Muallim has summoned the French ambassador in Damascus to a 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00000257  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>meeting on January 25, in what the French were regarding as a 
<br>sign of Syrian anxiety about the success of the International 
<br>Conference for Lebanon. 
<br> 
<br>Afghanistan 
<br>----------- 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S) MGM expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the 
<br>NATO Summit in Riga, and, looking ahead to the informal 
<br>ministerial on January 26, he emphasized that no EU country 
<br>was prepared to send additional troops to Afghanistan at this 
<br>time.  However, he said there was a willingness to undertake 
<br>further consultation on how to combine civil/military 
<br>objectives in Afghanistan (e.g., counternarcotics).  While 
<br>offering a justification for France's proposed contact group, 
<br>MGM did no press the point.
