<br>SUBJECT: U.S. REMOVAL OF PAKISTAN RESEARCH REACTOR FUEL ON 
<br>HOLD 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Anne W. Patterson for reasons 1.4 (b) (d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) XXXXXXXXXXXX, told Poloff on May 26 that the 
<br>recent spate of media attention on Pakistan's nuclear 
<br>security has led the GOP to delay an important 
<br>nonproliferation effort, the removal of U.S.-origin 
<br>highly-enriched uranium spent fuel from a Pakistani nuclear 
<br>research reactor. The GOP agreed in principle to the fuel 
<br>removal in 2007, but has been slow in scheduling a visit by 
<br>U.S. technical experts to discuss logistical and other 
<br>issues. In recent months, the Strategic Plans Division and 
<br>Ministry of Foreign Affairs both indicated progress on the 
<br>matter and a proposed visit for late May was under review. 
<br>However, according to XXXXXXXXXXXX, a recent GOP interagency review 
<br>of the program concluded that the "sensational" international 
<br>and local media coverage of the security of Pakistan's 
<br>nuclear weapons made it impossible to proceed at this time. 
<br>If the local media got word of the fuel removal, "they 
<br>certainly would portray it as the United States taking 
<br>Pakistan's nuclear weapons," he argued. The visit will have 
<br>to be delayed for 3-4 months or until the political climate 
<br>makes it more conducive to hosting a U.S. visit, he stated. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Comment: As noted in previous post reporting, the GOP 
<br>is extremely sensitive to media focus on Pakistan's nuclear 
<br>program. In a sign of their growing defensiveness, the 
<br>Foreign Office Spokesman took significant time out of his May 
<br>21 press conference to address nuclear security, stating 
<br>categorically, "there is simply no question of our strategic 
<br>assets falling into the wrong hands." To a question about 
<br>reported offers of U.S. help with nuclear security, he 
<br>responded, "we do not need this assistance." With the 
<br>postponement of the nuclear fuel removal, it is clear that 
<br>the negative media attention has begun to hamper U.S. efforts 
<br>to improve Pakistan's nuclear security and nonproliferation 
<br>practices. End Comment.
