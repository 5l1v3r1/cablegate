<br>SUBJECT: U/S TAUSCHER'S DECEMBER 1-2 VISIT TO ISRAEL 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: A/DCM Marc Sievers, reasons 1.4 (b),(d) 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (S) Summary:  Under Secretary for Arms Control and 
<br>International Security Ellen Tauscher visited Israel December 
<br>1-2.  U/S Tauscher focused her visit on setting the stage for 
<br>a successful Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review 
<br>Conference (RevCon) in May 2010.  She consulted with GOI 
<br>interlocutors on potential strategy in addressing Egyptian 
<br>insistence on pushing for the establishment of a nuclear 
<br>weapon free zone (NWFZ) in the Middle East, as a way to 
<br>divert attention from Iran to Israel.  U/S Tauscher 
<br>reiterated that the United States will not take any action to 
<br>compromise Israel's security and would consult closely with 
<br>Israel -- which GOI officials greatly appreciated. 
<br>Nevertheless, U/S Tauscher said the United States is 
<br>interested in exploring possible small steps involving Israel 
<br>to address some of Egypt's NWFZ concerns regarding the lack 
<br>of implementation of the 1995 resolution.  GOI officials for 
<br>the most part were critical of these tactics, questioning why 
<br>Israel should be portrayed as part of the problem.  They 
<br>recommended a more direct approach to President Mubarak -- 
<br>thereby circumventing the Egyptian MFA -- in which Egypt is 
<br>reminded that Iran is the regional nuclear threat.  Other 
<br>topics discussed include President Obama's arms control and 
<br>nonproliferation agenda, the P5 1 process and Iran's nuclear 
<br>program, the FMCT and CTBT, Jordan's plans for a nuclear 
<br>reactor, and Israel's qualitative military edge (QME).  End 
<br>summary. 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (SBU) U/S Tauscher met with National Security Advisor Uzi 
<br>Arad on December 1.  Arad was accompanied by NSC Senior 
<br>Advisor and Nuclear Security Summit Sherpa Gil Reich.  In a 
<br>separate meeting on December 1, U/S Tauscher met with MFA 
<br>Director General Yossi Gal, Deputy Director General for North 
<br>America Baruch Bina, and Deputy Director General for 
<br>Strategic Affairs Alon Bar.  U.S. participants for the Arad 
<br>and Gal meetings included Political Counselor Marc Sievers, T 
<br>Senior Advisor James Timbie, NSC's Adam Scheinman, and 
<br>political military officer Jason Grubb.  U/S Tauscher met for 
<br>dinner with Israel Atomic Energy Commission (IAEC) and MFA 
<br>senior officials on December 1, including IAEC Director 
<br>General Saul Chorev, Deputy Director General David Danieli, 
<br>and Director for Policy and Arms Control Merav Zefary-Odiz, 
<br>as well as MFA DDG Bar and Director for Arms Control Rodica 
<br>Radian-Gordon.  On December 2, U/S Tauscher met for breakfast 
<br>with MOD Political-Military Chief Amos Gilad; U.S. attendees 
<br>included Charge D'Affaires Luis Moreno, Timbie, Scheinman, 
<br>and Grubb. 
<br> 
<br>Arms Control/Nonproliferation Agenda 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (S) In various meetings with GOI interlocutors, U/S 
<br>Tauscher outlined an ambitious arms control and 
<br>nonproliferation agenda, beginning with the President's 
<br>Prague speech, and including other priorities such as a 
<br>follow-on to START, CTBT ratification, the upcoming NPT 
<br>Review Conference, and negotiating the FMCT.  She noted that 
<br>negotiations with Moscow on START were slow to develop in 
<br>part due to delayed confirmations and Russian wariness.  But 
<br>U/S Tauscher expected a START follow-on -- including a strong 
<br>verification regime -- soon. 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (S) National Security Advisor Arad described President 
<br>Obama's arms control and nonproliferation agenda as "daunting 
<br>and challenging."  He reaffirmed that the GOI will 
<br>participate in the April 2010 Nuclear Security summit in 
<br>Washington, noting that PM Netanyahu planned to attend the 
<br>summit as discussed between President Obama and PM Netanyahu 
<br>during their recent one-on-one meeting in Washington.  GOI 
<br>Nuclear Summit Sherpa Gil Reich noted, however, that the 
<br>Holocaust memorial day in Israel might be a potential 
<br>scheduling conflict with the summit.  Arad expressed 
<br>appreciation for the summit, noting that if the initiative 
<br>had been pursued ten years previously, perhaps proliferation 
<br>cases such as AQ Khan might have been prevented or at least 
<br>controlled.  He wished the United States success negotiating 
<br>with the Russians on START. 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (S) Due to the U.S. administration's prioritization of 
<br>arms control and nonproliferation, Arad also noted that the 
<br>GOI had recently reconvened a high level committee on these 
<br>issues comprised of GOI officials and experts from outside 
<br>the government.  He noted that the committee had been formed 
<br>during President George Herbert Walker Bush's administration 
<br>to analyze treaties such as the CWC and CTBT, but stopped 
<br>meeting in 2007.  U/S Tauscher expressed interest in meeting 
<br>with the group during her next visit to Israel; Arad took the 
<br>request on board. 
<br> 
<br>Egypt and the NPT 
<br>----------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (S) On the NPT, U/S Tauscher reiterated the importance of 
<br>a successful Review Conference -- including hopefully a 
<br>consensus resolution.  She raised U.S. concerns over 
<br>potential Egyptian actions at the RevCon, based on previous 
<br>decades of behavior and "10-15 year-old talking points."  U/S 
<br>Tauscher said the United States is not "naive" with respect 
<br>to Egypt; nevertheless, the United States must make a 
<br>sincere, good faith effort to create the conditions for a 
<br>positive RevCon -- this might include small steps with Israel 
<br>to address some of Egypt's desire to demonstrate progress in 
<br>implementation of the 1995 resolution on a region free of 
<br>weapons of mass destruction. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (S) That said, U/S Tauscher reiterated that the United 
<br>States would consult and coordinate with Israel, and would 
<br>take no action that might compromise Israel's security.  She 
<br>noted that the United States would like to elevate the NPT 
<br>RevCon issue to President Mubarak at an appropriate time, and 
<br>expressed interest in developing an alternate communication 
<br>track to Mubarak to circumvent the MFA, potentially through 
<br>Egyptian Intelligence Minister LTG Suleiman.  U/S Tauscher 
<br>said her message to Cairo will be "very tough," and that 
<br>Egyptian obstructionist behavior linking Israel to Iran's 
<br>nuclear program is not helping Egypt. 
<br> 
<br>¶8. (S) Arad said relations with Egypt were "relatively good," 
<br>describing continued dialogue between PM Netanyahu and 
<br>President Mubarak, and strong channels of communication at 
<br>other levels.  In many respects, he said Israel's relations 
<br>with Egypt are almost as good as during PM Rabin's time. 
<br>Arad said Egypt and Israel do not see "eye-to-eye" on some 
<br>issues such as Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, but 
<br>otherwise relations are strong. 
<br> 
<br>¶9. (S) Arad described the Egyptian MFA, however, as a 
<br>"nagging problem" in the relationship, particularly regarding 
<br>the Middle East NWFZ issue, and noted Cairo's refusal to talk 
<br>to FM Lieberman.  Other GOI officials expressed exasperation 
<br>over Egyptian motivations on the NWFZ; Reich raised Egyptian 
<br>behavior at the latest IAEA General Conference, as well as 
<br>Cairo's negative reaction to the IAEA Board of Governor's 
<br>recent statement on Iran.  Arad said Israel has supported a 
<br>regional NWFZ as far back as 1992, provided Israel enjoyed 
<br>peaceful relations with its neighbors.  He said the GOI has 
<br>spoken frankly with Cairo, noting that such behavior is not 
<br>helpful, and is misdirecting focus away from Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (S) MOD Political-Military Chief Amos Gilad said Egypt 
<br>understands that Iran is the real threat to the region, 
<br>noting that a nuclear weapon-armed Iran is a redline for 
<br>Cairo.  He averred that Egypt does not accept that Iran will 
<br>become a superpower, but remains afraid of its own domestic 
<br>political situation post-Mubarak.  Gilad expressed succession 
<br>concerns, noting that Mubarak is "approaching the past more 
<br>quickly than the future."  He added that Mubarak does not 
<br>have confidence in Egyptian Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (S) MFA Deputy Director General for Strategic Affairs 
<br>Alon Bar outlined repeated attempts by the GOI to engage with 
<br>the Egyptian MFA, but to no avail. He described Egyptian 
<br>actions linking Israel to Iran's nuclear program in the IAEA 
<br>as "not encouraging," and questioned how to convince Egypt to 
<br>drop this "obsession" over the NWFZ.  Israel Atomic Energy 
<br>Commission (IAEC) Director General Saul Chorev and Arms 
<br>Control Director Merav Zefary-Odiz speculated that Egypt 
<br>feels challenged by Iranian attempts to acquire nuclear 
<br>weapons, and includes Israel in any public attack on Tehran 
<br>in order to give Cairo coverage from regional criticism.  Bar 
<br>argued that the Egyptian MFA raises Israel's nuclear program 
<br>as a "wedge issue" in order to prevent better relations 
<br>between Israel and others in the region.  IAEC Deputy 
<br>Director General David Danieli concurred, noting that Egypt 
<br>can use the nuclear issue to put Israel "in a corner" while 
<br>benefiting from positive relations between the two countries. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶12. (S) Zefary-Odiz also reviewed her participation in an 
<br>International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and 
<br>Disarmament conference in September 2009 in Cairo.  She 
<br>described the conference as "very confrontational," and that 
<br>it was clear Israel was targeted by Egyptian interlocutors. 
<br>Zefary-Odiz acknowledged that the GOI had anticipated such 
<br>behavior, and contemplated skipping the conference.  She 
<br>noted that Egyptian officials also lambasted Iranian 
<br>participants, but were always careful to include Israel and 
<br>Iran in the same sentence. 
<br> 
<br>¶13. (S) Arad said the GOI will take their cue from U.S. 
<br>"heavy-lifting": if there is a small step -- "not a 
<br>concession," he stressed -- that Israel could take to help 
<br>facilitate, then the GOI would consider it.  He noted that 
<br>the GOI wanted to see a "reversal of trends" from Egypt 
<br>regarding Iran's nuclear program -- after all, it is in 
<br>Egypt's interest to do so.  He said Israel continues to have 
<br>reservations regarding the NPT -- following nuclear pursuits 
<br>by Libya, Syria, and Iran, it is clear to the GOI that the 
<br>NPT is not sufficient and must be strengthened.  The goal of 
<br>the NPT, he stressed, should not be to "prevent the next 
<br>Iran, but to stop Iran in order to prevent the next Iran" 
<br>from occurring. 
<br> 
<br>¶14. (S) Chorev speculated that Egypt will aim to ruin the 
<br>RevCon.  Bar said the Egyptians have not been held 
<br>accountable for past bad behavior at the NPT RevCon -- "they 
<br>have never paid the price."  He noted that Cairo knows the 
<br>importance the United States attaches to a successful RevCon, 
<br>and therefore will try to leverage a "high price" in order 
<br>not to ruin it.  He noted similar tactics with regard to 
<br>Egypt's counter-smuggling efforts along the border with Gaza. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶15. (S) Timbie outlined several small steps that might 
<br>address Egyptian concerns and demonstrate progress in 
<br>implementation of the 1995 resolution and the Middle East 
<br>NWFZ: an IAEA forum on the experience of other regional 
<br>NWFZs; a special coordinator or rappateur on 1995 resolution 
<br>implementation; a statement from the United States, United 
<br>Kingdom and Russia reiterating the importance of the 1995 
<br>resolution; and exploring text with Israel and Egypt on 
<br>universality and compliance. 
<br> 
<br>¶16. (S) Gilad questioned these steps from a 
<br>"tactical/strategic" context, and suggested this was not a 
<br>tactical matter.  He argued against creating the impression 
<br>that Israel was the problem.  Instead, Gilad recommended a 
<br>strategic, traditional approach -- concessions will only be 
<br>used by Egypt as leverage.  He suggested the United States 
<br>remind Egypt of its special relationship based on U.S. 
<br>support, and reaffirm that Iran is the "bad guy."  Gilad said 
<br>Egypt should also be reminded that most countries in the 
<br>region agree with the NWFZ concept in principle; the Egyptian 
<br>MFA's insistence on an immediate NWFZ neither fits the 
<br>current political reality nor makes sense as it diverts focus 
<br>from Iranian intransigence.  He noted that Egypt listens to 
<br>the United States; it is therefore important to speak clearly 
<br>and directly when taking the issue to Mubarak. 
<br> 
<br>¶17. (S) Chorev and Zefary-Odiz argued these steps had been 
<br>tried in the past -- and had failed.  Danieli questioned why 
<br>Israel should take any steps at all.  Based on experience at 
<br>the IAEA and the UN First Committee on Disarmament and 
<br>International Security, he said "nothing satisfies Egypt" as 
<br>Cairo "pockets every concession" and demands more -- "it's a 
<br>slippery slope."  Danieli said Israel will not "play by 
<br>Egypt's rules."  Bar concurred, noting that Egypt will "raise 
<br>the bar," and begin negotiations with these small steps as 
<br>the baseline -- he was skeptical such steps would prove 
<br>helpful. 
<br> 
<br>¶18. (S) Arad characterized these steps as "talking endlessly" 
<br>-- that is "not progress," he said.  He was uncomfortable 
<br>discussing Israel NPT compliance, especially as Israel is not 
<br>a party to the treaty.  He also raised concerns regarding the 
<br>definition of the Middle East NWFZ -- did it also include 
<br>Pakistan, India and Iran, for example?  Arad said such 
<br>questions should be posed to Cairo -- if Egypt is willing to 
<br>include Pakistan in its definition of a Middle East NWFZ, 
<br>then we can take that as a signal that Cairo is ready for a 
<br>serious conversation on the matter. 
<br> 
<br>¶19. (S) Zefary-Odiz argued that the NPT as a "global 
<br>solution" is not appropriate in the current political 
<br>realities of the Middle East.  Due to the region's prior 
<br>track record of NPT non-compliance, she said a gradual, 
<br>step-by-step process employing confidence building measures 
<br>be used to improve relations between neighbors.  NPT partner 
<br>obligations should be enhanced, not reduced, she said. 
<br>Zefary-Odiz noted that only after peaceful relations are 
<br>established can arms control measures be pursued, starting 
<br>with conventional weapons and later focusing on 
<br>chemical/biological/nuclear arms.  She said that Egypt and 
<br>other Arab states de-link comprehensive peace from arms 
<br>control measures -- Israel views these elements as 
<br>inseparable and sequential. 
<br> 
<br>¶20. (S) On a related note, Chorev asked if Israel should 
<br>attend the RevCon as an observer.  U/S Tauscher and Timbie 
<br>replied that the decision was ultimately the GOI's to make, 
<br>but offered to raise the issue in Washington .  Chorev noted 
<br>that Israel would be careful not to "make any noise," and 
<br>could play a positive, consultative role.  On the other hand, 
<br>Danieli acknowledged the argument that as a non-party, 
<br>perhaps it was not appropriate for Israel to attend. 
<br> 
<br>Iran 
<br>---- 
<br> 
<br>¶21. (S) U/S Tauscher said the United States was very 
<br>concerned about the recently announced Iranian plans to build 
<br>ten additional uranium enrichment facilities.  She reiterated 
<br>the two track strategy of persuasion and pressure, and noted 
<br>that the time for persuasion is "waning."  U/S Tauscher said 
<br>the United States has "created the coalition" it had hoped 
<br>for, and was happy to see the recent IAEA BOG's resolution 
<br>transferred to the UNSC. 
<br> 
<br>¶22. (S) U/S Tauscher noted that the United States was working 
<br>hard through the P5 1 process to encourage Russian and 
<br>Chinese cooperation to counter continued Iranian 
<br>intransigence and inflammatory rhetoric -- Russia and China 
<br>are "lynch pins," she said.  She noted that Russia had worked 
<br>closely with the United States on the Tehran Research Reactor 
<br>(TRR) proposal, which Moscow considered an "elegant 
<br>solution," -- but Iran had not agreed.  Keeping Russia 
<br>engaged, U/S Tauscher explained, also means Chinese 
<br>cooperation. 
<br> 
<br>¶23. (S) MOD Political-Military Chief Amos Gilad described 
<br>recent Russian cooperation on Iran as encouraging, but 
<br>expressed reservations that Russia would join in any 
<br>sanctions against Iran.  He explained that Moscow has raised 
<br>the provision of sophisticated Israeli unmanned aerial 
<br>vehicle (UAV) technology in exchange for canceling the S-300 
<br>sale to Tehran.  Gilad said that Russian interlocutors had 
<br>acknowledged development gaps in their UAV platform, and is 
<br>prepared to pay USD one billion for Israeli UAV technology. 
<br>He reiterated that Israel will not provide its latest UAV 
<br>technology, arguing that such technology would likely end up 
<br>in the hands of the Chinese. 
<br> 
<br>¶24. (S) Arad said the GOI appreciated the United States' 
<br>efforts regarding Iran, noting how hard the United States has 
<br>worked to build an alliance.  He pointed to the recent IAEA 
<br>Board of Governor's resolution as a successful example of 
<br>U.S. efforts.  Regarding the Qom facility, Arad said the GOI 
<br>was not surprised by Tehran's "chutzpah."  He described a 
<br>high degree of alertness in Israel, and added that the GOI 
<br>studies daily Iranian posturing and boastful announcements in 
<br>an attempt to discern Iranian intentions.  Arad commented 
<br>that the trends are bad, as Iran continues to accumulate low 
<br>enriched uranium. 
<br> 
<br>¶25. (S) MFA DG Gal said there was not much difference in the 
<br>national intelligence estimations (U.S., UK, France, and 
<br>Russia) regarding Iran.  He said the GOI takes "very 
<br>seriously" Iranian plans for ten new enrichment facilities -- 
<br>"time is of the essence," and "now is the time to implement 
<br>crippling sanctions," he added.  Gal likened the case for 
<br>enhanced sanctions to prescribed antibiotics from a doctor -- 
<br>one must take the full course of antibiotics for the 
<br>prescribed period of time, or they will not work. 
<br> 
<br>¶26. (S) Turning to his crystal ball, Gilad was not sure 
<br>Tehran had decided it wants a nuclear weapon -- but is 
<br>"determined" to obtain the option to build one.  He 
<br>acknowledged that the engagement strategy is a good idea -- 
<br>"as long as you understand that it will not work."  Gilad 
<br>said it should be clear by February 2010 that engagement as a 
<br>option has failed -- the imposition of "crippling sanctions" 
<br>for the February/March/April timeframe is crucial.  He said 
<br>Russian cooperation will be the key, and the current Russian 
<br>cooperative mind-set cannot necessarily be counted on in 
<br>several weeks time.  By June of next year, Gilad said it 
<br>should be clear whether sanctions have worked.  However, 
<br>given Tehran's clandestine nuclear program (e.g., Qom), he 
<br>said it will not be clear when Iran has reached the "point of 
<br>no return" -- he doubted Iran will choose to let it overtly 
<br>known that it has produced a nuclear weapon. 
<br> 
<br>FMCT and CTBT 
<br>------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶27. (S) IAEC DG Chorev raised the FMCT's future in the 
<br>Conference on Disarmament.  U/S Tauscher acknowledged 
<br>frustration with Pakistan, and noted that while Washington 
<br>places a high priority on the FMCT, other efforts like a 
<br>START follow-on and the CTBT will come first.  Timbie added 
<br>that it will take some time to negotiate an FMCT. 
<br> 
<br>¶28. (S) Chorev asked about the current prospects for CTBT 
<br>ratification in the Senate.  U/S Tauscher noted that the 
<br>START follow-on was a higher priority, and said the Senate 
<br>will likely focus on the Law of the Sea treaty before turning 
<br>its attention to the CTBT.  She pointed to mid-term 
<br>Congressional elections in 2010, and explained that focusing 
<br>on the CTBT in 2011 might be more prudent given the 
<br>controversy associated with the treaty.  U/S Tauscher 
<br>explained the necessity of making the case for the CTBT, and 
<br>hoped to build political momentum in favor of the treaty 
<br>through the release of the Nuclear Posture Review, a new 
<br>national intelligence estimate, and the handover on the 
<br>stockpile stewardship program. 
<br> 
<br>¶29. (S) Chorev asked that the United States consult with the 
<br>GOI on the CTBT, where he said Israel could be "more flexible 
<br>than the FMCT."  U/S Tauscher asked if the GOI might be 
<br>willing to make affirmative statements in support of the 
<br>CTBT; Chorev made no promises, but suspected such a statement 
<br>might be possible -- especially if it would help with Senate 
<br>ratification. 
<br> 
<br>¶30. (S) Chorev described the FMCT as "very difficult" for 
<br>Israel.  Scheinman confirmed that negotiations would be based 
<br>on the 2006 draft FMCT text, with an added verification 
<br>regime that is being worked on -- he described the 
<br>verification regime's definitions as "critical" in that 
<br>regard.  Danieli questioned the FMCT's added value, arguing 
<br>that it would have little impact.  He asked who was the 
<br>FMCT's real target -- India, Pakistan or even Israel? 
<br> 
<br>Jordanian Nuclear Reactor 
<br>------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶31. (S) IAEC DG Chorev raised Jordanian plans to build a 
<br>nuclear reactor.  He said the GOI has decided not to oppose 
<br>the reactor, and have offered the Jordanians Israeli 
<br>expertise on where best to build it.  Chorev said the IAEC 
<br>formed a steering committee with its Jordanian counterpart 
<br>comprised of three working groups focusing on safety, 
<br>geological surveys, and water issues.  Chorev said the 
<br>steering committee first met in Amman in June 2009, and is 
<br>waiting to convene again.  Danieli stressed that the GOI does 
<br>not want to hamper the Jordanian nuclear plans, but added 
<br>that Israel has concerns about border issues and security 
<br>associated with the reactor.  Timbie said the United States 
<br>is pushing Jordan to sign a 123 Agreement along the same 
<br>lines as the recent agreement signed with UAE, only stronger. 
<br> Zefary-Odiz noted that Egypt is putting tremendous pressure 
<br>on Jordan not to accept a 123 Agreement. 
<br> 
<br>QME 
<br>--- 
<br> 
<br>¶32. (S) U/S Tauscher reiterated the United States' strong 
<br>commitment to Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME), and 
<br>expressed appreciation for the GOI's willingness to work with 
<br>us through the newly created QME working groups.  Both MOD 
<br>Pol-Mil Chief Gilad and MFA DDG Bar commended the newly 
<br>created QME working groups, and asked they be scheduled to 
<br>convene as soon as possible. 
<br>
