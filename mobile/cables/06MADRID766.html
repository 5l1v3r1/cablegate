<br>
<br>¶1. (U) Summary. The recent announcement of a permanent
<br>ceasefire by the Basque separatist terror group ETA was met
<br>with cautious optimism by a public that recalls ETA's
<br>abandonment of previous truces. However, there is a sense
<br>that ETA's declining military fortunes and Zapatero's
<br>readiness to engage Basque political factions, have convinced
<br>ETA of the need to end violence and shift to the political
<br>arena. Government figures involved in the negotiations
<br>remain tight-lipped about the details of their discussions,
<br>but press reports indicate that Sinn Fein figures played a
<br>role in convincing ETA to shift to the political process and
<br>that Sinn Fein briefed former President Clinton and USG
<br>officials regarding the progess of the ETA talks; a March 30
<br>press report indicated strong interest by former President
<br>Clinton in playing a mediating role. Some ETA-Government
<br>discussions evidently took place in third countries,
<br>including in Norway and Switzerland. The ETA announcement
<br>has proven a major political victory for the Zapatero
<br>government, one that will likely benefit the Socialist Party
<br>through the 2008 general elections. End summary.
<br>
<br>//ETA ON THE WANE//
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) ETA has killed more than 850 people during its
<br>four-decade-long battle to win self-determination for the
<br>Basque Region, which already enjoys considerable autonomy,
<br>including its own police force, control over tax revenues,
<br>and management of its education system. The terrorist group
<br>benefited from both a strong Basque sense of cultural
<br>identity and from the region's historical grievances against
<br>the Madrid government. However, support for ETA has been
<br>limited by the Basque region's heterogenous political
<br>environment (with about one-third of the electorate
<br>supporting close ties to the central government) and by the
<br>strength of moderate Basque nationalist political groups.
<br>ETA and its political front groups, known as the "abertzale"
<br>or Basque nationalist left, have maintained a core of
<br>approximately 150,000 supporters out of the Basque Region's
<br>population of 2.1 million, a political base strong enough to
<br>play a spoiler, but too small to set the political agenda.
<br>
<br>¶3. (U) ETA's military capacity has been in steady decline
<br>since 1990, a trend that has accelerated in recent years.
<br>The combination of Spanish/French police pressure and the
<br>exclusion of ETA front group Batasuna from the political
<br>system (because of its refusal to renounce terrorism) had
<br>greatly weakened ETA by 2004. Most police observers believe
<br>that fewer than 150 ETA terrorists remain at large, while
<br>more than 500 are being held in Spanish and French jails.
<br>The March 2004 Madrid train attacks added complications for
<br>ETA in the form of increased public intolerance of political
<br>violence, even among Basque radical supporters.
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) The Socialist (PSOE) victory in 2004 also led to
<br>greatly improved relations between the central government and
<br>moderate Basque political parties, further isolating radical
<br>Basque nationalists. Zapatero hinted, however, that the PSOE
<br>would be open to a greater political role for ETA front
<br>groups if the organization abandoned the armed struggle, an
<br>important signal in advance of key municipal elections coming
<br>up in 2007. Sensing the shift in its political and military
<br>environment, ETA approached the Zapatero government in August
<br>2004 to suggest exploratory discussions.
<br>
<br>//MULTIPLE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION//
<br>
<br>¶5. (U) While the small circle of Zapatero advisers who manage
<br>the ETA peace process have refused to discuss details, press
<br>reports indicate that Zapatero responded positively to ETA's
<br>soundings, authorizing a series of contacts that eventually
<br>led to the March 22 cease fire announcement. It appears that
<br>those discussions were undertaken through intermediaries in
<br>different locations, including in Oslo and Geneva in the
<br>summer of 2005, and that the talks were intended as
<br>confidence building measures rather than to formally resolve
<br>specific issues.
<br>
<br>¶6. (U) At the international level, Sinn Fein figures played
<br>an important role in convincing ETA to announce a cease fire
<br>and express support for a political solution to the conflict.
<br>Specifically, Parliamentarians Gerry Kelly and Alex Maskey
<br>have been identified as Sinn Fein "advisers" to ETA, a role
<br>they allegedly took on at the request of Batasuna. According
<br>to the daily "El Mundo," Kelly and Maskey briefed Sinn Fein
<br>leader Gerry Adams, who then reportedly briefed the Irish and
<br>UK governments, as well as U.S. State Department official
<br>Mitchell Reiss and former President Clinton, on the progress
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000766 002.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>of the talks. According to Spanish daily "El Periodico,"
<br>Spanish government sources report that former President
<br>Clinton contacted Zapatero to offer to act as a mediator in
<br>ETA discussions; the press report said Zapatero was very
<br>interested in involving a "U.S. Democrat with international
<br>prestige" in the peace talks. COMMENT: The Embassy has not
<br>received any such indications from the Spanish government.
<br>END COMMENT.
<br>
<br>¶7. (U) While these international contacts were important in
<br>bringing ETA along, the key internal communications began
<br>with a set of conversations between the Basque branch of the
<br>Spanish Socialist Party and Batasuna leader Arnaldo Otegi in
<br>early 2004. Through these discussions (which will be
<br>reviewed extensively in a separate cable), the Zapatero
<br>government signaled its willingness to negotiate with radical
<br>Basques, but only if ETA announced a halt to its terrorist
<br>activities. Batasuna and Basque Socialist leaders agreed
<br>during these talks that ETA would leave political issues to
<br>be handled by "abertzale" (Basque leftist) political parties,
<br>while ETA would only address issues related to weapons and
<br>ETA prisoners. Under these terms, ETA agreed to a cease
<br>fire, at a time to be determined by the organization. Almost
<br>certainly, ETA made the announcement now in the hope that
<br>Batasuna would have time to negotiate its participation in
<br>the 2007 Basque municipal elections.
<br>
<br>//PARSING THE CEASE FIRE//
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Spanish experts and media pored over the March 22
<br>cease fire announcement to compare it with previous truce
<br>delcarations. The most critical element in the 2006 ETA
<br>document in comparison with previous delarations is the
<br>absence of an explicit demand for Basque self-determination,
<br>ETA's central ambition throughout its history. The short ETA
<br>statement appears to have been drafted to fit the resolution
<br>approved by Spain's Congress in May 2005, which requires
<br>ETA's abandonment of the armed struggle as a pre-condition
<br>for government negotiations with ETA. Skeptics point out
<br>that the ETA statement neither expressed regret for ETA's use
<br>of terrorist methods nor repudiated tactics such as extortion
<br>and "kale borroka," (organized vandalism and street
<br>violence), tactics it continued to employ during previous
<br>truces. It is vague in that respect and could leave the door
<br>open for ETA to continue to use these methods.
<br>
<br>¶9. (U) Zapatero is expected to delay responding to ETA for at
<br>least two months to allow the government to determine whether
<br>ETA is complying with its cease fire. In an important
<br>clarification, Vice President Maria Teresa Fernandez de la
<br>Vega indicated that the government viewed both the cessation
<br>of ETA street violence and the halt of ETA extortion of
<br>Basque businesses as part of the cease fire.
<br>
<br>//A POLITICAL COUP FOR ZAPATERO//
<br>
<br>¶10. (SBU) While there is far to go in achieving a definitive
<br>end to the ETA problem, the cease fire announcement
<br>constitutes a resounding political victory for Zapatero. The
<br>cease fire not only vindicated Zapatero's pursuit of a
<br>negotiated solution to the conflict, it also undermined
<br>opposition accusations that he was weak on terrorism. The
<br>result was an immediate jump in Zapatero's approval ratings
<br>and a surge in confidence within the Socialist Party, which
<br>until the ETA announcement was barely one point ahead of the
<br>PP in the polls. Rafael Estrella, the Socialist spokesperson
<br>in the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Commission, told the DCM
<br>and Political Counselor on March 22 that the ETA announcement
<br>virtually guaranteed a political victory for the Socialist
<br>Party in the 2008 general elections. Less partisan observers
<br>have echoed this analysis.
<br>
<br>¶11. (U) Zapatero has moved swiftly to consolidate his
<br>advantage. After dramatically expressing his "full
<br>confidence" in the PP to work responsibly with his government
<br>in managing the ETA peace process, Zapatero met with Popular
<br>Party (PP) leader Mariano Rajoy on March 28 to seal the
<br>bargain. The PP grudgingly agreed to support the
<br>government's initiative, understanding that it would face a
<br>significant backlash if the party were perceived as blocking
<br>an opportunity to bring an end to ETA violence. In order to
<br>obtain full political cover, Zapatero will meet with all
<br>political parties to seek their support and is expected to
<br>eventually ask the Parliament for authorization to start
<br>official talks with ETA.
<br>
<br>//COMMENT//
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) It may be early for the PSOE to forecast victory in
<br>the 2008 elections, but the Zapatero government is clearly in
<br>a very strong position and well situated to direct events to
<br>
<br>MADRID 00000766 003.2 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>PSOE's advantage. Many observers expect Zapatero to delay
<br>any definitive solution regarding ETA's status and Basque
<br>autonomy until after the 2008 elections rather than risking a
<br>bruising political fight on these issues before electoral
<br>victory is assured. Zapatero could suffer if his handling of
<br>ETA is viewed as insensitive to the victims of terrorism, but
<br>his caution and pursuit of broad political backing for his
<br>approach to ETA will shield him to some degree. A more
<br>controversial point will be the political "reinsertion" of
<br>ETA-affiliated groups, which is necessary in Zapatero's view
<br>and yet anathema to the PP and to conservative voters. At
<br>this point, the most likely approach is the formation of a
<br>new Basque nationalist party rather than the "legalization"
<br>of Batasuna, since Batasuna remains under judicial sanction
<br>and is associated by the public with its defense of ETA
<br>terrorism.
