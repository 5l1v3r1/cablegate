<br>SUBJECT: MIGRATION SERVICE DIRECTOR ROMODANOVSKIY ON NORTH 
<br>KOREANS, STATELESSNESS IN RUSSIA 
<br>
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador William J. Burns. Reasons 1.4. (b and d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Federal Migration Service Director 
<br>Konstantin Romodanovskiy told PRM/Admissions Director Terry 
<br>Rusch October 6 that Russia would consider resettlement of 
<br>North Koreans to the U.S. on a case-by-case basis, repeating 
<br>what other GOR interlocutors have told us previously. 
<br>Separately, Romodanovskiy said that the GOR had enacted 
<br>legislation offering further opportunities for former Soviet 
<br>citizens who were living in Russia and now stateless to 
<br>obtain Russian citizenship. Romodanovskiy expressed an 
<br>interest in further cooperation with the U.S. and other 
<br>countries experienced in migration and is seen by our 
<br>contacts as someone trying to reform the migration service. 
<br>END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Federal Migration Service Director Konstantin 
<br>Romodanovskiy and members of his staff met with 
<br>PRM/Admissions Director Terry Rusch, DHS Chief of Refugee 
<br>Affairs Barbara Strack, Deputy Chief of Refugee Affairs June 
<br>Tancredi and refcoord October 6 to discuss the possible 
<br>resettlement of North Koreans to the U.S. and other potential 
<br>cooperation between the FMS and its U.S. counterparts. 
<br>
<br>North Koreans 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Rusch began the meeting by thanking Romodanovskiy for 
<br>FMS' assistance with the resettlement of Meskhetian Turks to 
<br>the U.S. and noted that the GOR,s experience with the 
<br>statelessness issue positioned it well to play an active role 
<br>within the international community in addressing it. She 
<br>noted that the purpose of her visit to Russia was to 
<br>participate in a workshop sponsored by the USG and the 
<br>International Organization for Migration to train NGOs in how 
<br>to refer cases to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Rusch 
<br>noted that the GOR was revising its laws on refugees and 
<br>expressed U.S. hopes that it would enhance protection for 
<br>asylum seekers. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Turning to North Koreans, Rusch explained the passage 
<br>of the North Korean Human Rights Act and U.S. interest in 
<br>resettling North Korean asylum seekers to the U.S. if they so 
<br>desired. The U.S. understood the sensitivities of this issue 
<br>for the GOR given its relationship with North Korea, and it 
<br>appreciated the GOR's willingness to work with UNHCR and the 
<br>ROK in resettling North Koreans in South Korea. There had 
<br>been instances, including when a North Korean had approached 
<br>the U.S. Consulate in Vladivostok, expressing interest in 
<br>third country resettlement The U.S. Government hoped that if 
<br>an asylum seeker desired to go to the U.S. rather than South 
<br>Korea, the GOR would allow the United States to process the 
<br>case. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Romodanovskiy said that there were North Koreans in 
<br>Russia and that their status varied. Each year, about 20-30 
<br>of them were resettled to South Korea through UNHCR and the 
<br>ROK. Romodanovskiy stressed that the FMS did not have sole 
<br>responsibility for these issues, and it worked in conjunction 
<br>with other GOR agencies, the MFA and others, that also have 
<br>to be involved. 
<br>
<br>Statelessness 
<br>------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Rusch raised the issue of statelessness in Russia. 
<br>Romodanovskiy said that the collapse of the Soviet Union had 
<br>created a burden for Russia, which had to absorb forced 
<br>migrants from within the former Soviet space, care for 
<br>internally displaced persons from Chechnya, and deal with 
<br>refugees from third countries such as Afghanistan. Among 
<br>them were Soviet citizens who were now stateless and needed 
<br>to be integrated into Russia. Romodanovskiy said that, 
<br>during the last year, it had granted citizenship to 508,000 
<br>people, of whom 210,000 were former Soviet citizens who had 
<br>delayed seeking Russian citizenship. The GOR realized that 
<br>there were several thousand more, and early this year, 
<br>President Putin signed a law extending the deadline for 
<br>Soviet citizens in Russia to claim Russian citizenship until 
<br>¶2008. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Romodanovskiy said the FMS continued to implement 
<br>reforms and wanted to cooperate with the U.S. and other 
<br>Western countries and that the GOR had initiated the G-8 
<br>experts meeting on migration that had just concluded in 
<br>Lisbon. One of the key issues for the FMS was further 
<br>
<br>MOSCOW 00011778 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>development of its visa regime, but is was also interested in 
<br>broader issues of migration and the processing of refugees 
<br>and asylum seekers. Strack noted that USCIS would be pleased 
<br>to organize briefings for Romodanovskiy or his staff in the 
<br>event of a visit to the United States. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The FMS has had difficulties defining its missions 
<br>and its goals as a result of constant GOR reorganizations and 
<br>a lack of leadership. Our contacts at UNHCR and elsewhere 
<br>have welcomed Romodanovskiy's leadership in taking charge of 
<br>the organization and his interest in cooperation. They note, 
<br>however, that as a result of the reorganizations and merger 
<br>with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the FMS has developed 
<br>a law-enforcement mentality.
