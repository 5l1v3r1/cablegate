<br>
<br>Iranian Martial Arts Clubs Used for Political Repression
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx a licensed martial arts coach and trainer
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx, told Baku Iran
<br>watcher that private martial arts clubs and their managers
<br>are under intense pressure to cooperate with Iranian
<br>intelligence and Revolutionary Guard organizations, both in
<br>training members and in working as "enforcers" in repression
<br>of protests and politically motivated killings. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>who provided originals of his Iranian coaching license and
<br>technical certificate as xxxxxxxxxxxx. He claimed that his
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx with difficulty maintained its
<br>independence from control by organizations affiliated with
<br>the Revolutionary Guard and/or intelligence service.
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx observed that Iranian internal security
<br>forces are highly suspicious of these clubs as potential
<br>vehicles for organization and "combat" training of future
<br>protesters and regime opponents. Nonetheless, he asserted
<br>that their main motivation is seeking to control these clubs
<br>is less driven by such fears as by a desire to deploy their
<br>trained membership at will for "special tasks." According to
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx these tasks range from providing martial arts
<br>training to Revolutionary Guard members and Basij, assistance
<br>in protest repression, intimidation, and crowd control, to
<br>political killings. He observed that use of these clubs and
<br>their members provides the security forces with "plausible
<br>deniability" for dirty undertakings, as well as trained
<br>fighters and potential trainers.
<br>
<br>Alleged Contract Killings
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx said he personally knew one such martial
<br>arts master whom he said was used by the Intelligence service
<br>to murder at least six different individuals over the course
<br>of several months in xxxxxxxxxxxx said that
<br>the victims included intellectuals and young "pro-democracy
<br>activists," adding that his assassin acquaintance was
<br>ultimately "suicided" by the authorities (i.e., killed in
<br>what was subsequently labeled a suicide). xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed
<br>that his club was raided and greatly restricted xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>after he and the club manager refused to train Basij or lend
<br>them their facilities. He said that they also refused to
<br>mobilize their membership to assist in repressing local
<br>protesters xxxxxxxxxxxx. Although he has
<br>stopped working at the school, he claimed to be under
<br>relentless pressure to cooperate, xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>
<br>¶4. (C)xxxxxxxxxxxx (Note and Comment: A xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>student recently echoed some of xxxxxxxxxxxx story, noting that
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx could only be held at night as during
<br>the daytime his instructors are "required to train the
<br>Revolutionary Guard." The use of martial arts clubs members
<br>as political enforcers/repressors existed under the Shah,
<br>and, according to sources, exists today in several
<br>neighboring countries, including the Republic of Azerbaijan.
<br>End Note and Comment).
<br>
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx "Pragmatic" on Post-Election Protests
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) On the topic of xxxxxxxxxxxx post-election protest
<br>activities, xxxxxxxxxxxx said that almost everyone he knew voted
<br>for Moussavi, and was angered by the fabricated result.
<br>
<br>Baku 00000687 002 of 002
<br>
<br>
<br>However, he claimed that there was considerable reluctance to
<br>turn to the streets once serious repression began. He said
<br>that xxxxxxxxxxxx are "very pragmatic"; while not afraid
<br>of protesting per se, they will only do so in favor of a
<br>tangible end result that they feel is clearly in their
<br>interest. He asserted that xxxxxxxxxxxx saw the election
<br>and subsequent fallout as a power struggle within the Tehran
<br>regime which had little to do with them or their felt
<br>interests. "People see it as an issue for Tehranis," he said,
<br>and are "reluctant to risk their necks" unless/until they
<br>feel that real regional policy changes are achievable.
<br>
