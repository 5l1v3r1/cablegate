<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) On December 20, the DCM met with European 
<br>Union chief of mission Ambassador Andrew Standley and 
<br>United Nations representative Jose Manuel Martinez Morales 
<br>to discuss reactions to the GOB's new coca strategy which 
<br>was announced at a December 18 ceremony in the Chapare. 
<br>Poloff also attended as notetaker. The GOB's plan includes 
<br>an increase of 8,000 hectares of coca cultivation above the 
<br>12,000 currently allowed under Bolivian law. The United 
<br>Nations and European Union representatives admitted that 
<br>their respective organizations lacked a clearly defined 
<br>response to the GOB's announced plan. Ambassador Standley 
<br>said that EU member countries were all concerned with the 
<br>GOB's plan and that they preferred a discreet response 
<br>rather than a public rebuke. The DCM explained that 
<br>Bolivian anti-narcotics review in March rested on a 
<br>number of factors but that the GOB's 2007 strategy, if 
<br>implemented, could complicate the review. The DCM 
<br>repeatedly stressed the need for the international 
<br>community to have a united and clear response to the GOB's 
<br>new plan; his peers concurred and discussed convening a 
<br>mini-Dublin group meeting in early January 2007. 
<br>End Summary. 
<br>
<br>---------- 
<br>Background 
<br>---------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) At a December 18 ceremony in the Chapare President 
<br>Morales unveiled the GOB's 2007 counter narcotics strategy. 
<br>The cornerstone of the strategy is the GOB's "commitment to 
<br>containing" coca cultivation at 20,000 hectares, an 
<br>increase from the 12,000 allowed under Bolivian law. 
<br>Morales also committed to improving drug consumption 
<br>prevention programs, strengthening interdiction, promoting 
<br>the industrialization of coca products, and changing 
<br>international conventions to decriminalize coca leaf. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>United Nations & European Union Position 
<br>---------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The United Nations and European Union 
<br>representatives admitted that their respective organ- 
<br>izations lacked a clearly defined response to the GOB's 
<br>announced plan. Mr. Martinez opened with the point, and 
<br>all parties agreed, that the GOB's plan was a violation of 
<br>both international conventions (1961 Single Convention on 
<br>Narcotic Drugs) and Bolivia's own narcotics law (known as 
<br>law 1008). Ambassador Standley said that EU member 
<br>countries were all concerned with the GOB's plan and that 
<br>they preferred a discreet response rather than a public 
<br>rebuke. Standley stated his personal opinion that the GOB 
<br>will never find widespread legal (industrial) uses for 
<br>Bolivia's excess coca. Mr. Standley noted that the GOB 
<br>continues to stall EU efforts to perform a study on the 
<br>size of Bolivia's licit coca market. He mentioned that he 
<br>recently met with Pablo Solon, Bolivia's Ambassador at 
<br>large for integration and trade issues, who assured him 
<br>the GOB was still interested in the study and that it 
<br>would move forward on it in January. Standley was most 
<br>interested in hearing how the United States was planning 
<br>to respond to the GOB's plan and how it would impact 
<br>Bolivia's narcotics certification in March 2007. 
<br>
<br>---------------- 
<br>DCM Urs' Remarks 
<br>---------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) The DCM explained that Embassy La Paz had been 
<br>warned that the GOB was planning a change in licit coca 
<br>growing targets and that the Ambassador had expressed the 
<br>USG's concern over the GOB's plan prior to its 
<br>announcement. The DCM concurred that strong public 
<br>denunciations of the GOB's plan would be counter- 
<br>productive. The DCM explained that the USG was prepared 
<br>to sign its annual letter of agreement with the GOB on 
<br>counter narcotics that same day and would not abandon its 
<br>anti-drug efforts at this time. However, he emphasized 
<br>that USG officials will state both privately and publicly 
<br>that that the GOB's new strategy is a step backwards and 
<br>seems to violate international commitments. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) The DCM explained that White House review of 
<br>Bolivian counter-narcotic efforts in March rested on a 
<br>number of factors but that the GOB's 2007 strategy if 
<br>implemented would seriously complicate the review. He 
<br>explained that the USG position would push for Bolivia to 
<br>move forward on the EU's proposed coca study. In response 
<br>to this potential requirement, Mr. Martinez observed, 
<br>with a hint of sarcasm, that the GOB was likely to 
<br>announce its plan to begin the study on February 28, 
<br>¶2007. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) The DCM repeatedly stressed the need for the 
<br>international community to have a united and clear response 
<br>to the GOB's new plan. The DCM suggested that a mini- 
<br>Dublin group meeting be convened to develop a common 
<br>position. Ambassador Standley and Mr. Martinez concurred 
<br>with the DCM's suggestions, and the three agreed that 
<br>January 8 or 9 would be a suitable date for the meeting.
