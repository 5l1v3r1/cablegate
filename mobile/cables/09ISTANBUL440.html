<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Recent discussions with Turkish and Iranian 
<br>think-tank, business, and political activist contacts on the 
<br>issue of Turkey-Iran relations reveal a broad consensus that: 
<br>(1) Turkey pursues closer relations with Iran out of desires 
<br>for regional stability and conflict avoidance, recognition of 
<br>Turkey as an indispensable East-West bridge; strengthening a 
<br>long-term energy and commercial relationship; and hope that 
<br>Turkey's approach will moderate Iranian regime behavior.  (2) 
<br>Iran reciprocates because it sees Turkey as a hedge against 
<br>its diplomatic isolation, a buffer against sanctions, and a 
<br>safety valve for its population.  However, (3) Turkey's 
<br>influence over Iranian decision-making it limited; Turkey has 
<br>never persuaded Iran to change course on an issue of 
<br>strategic concern to the regime.  To quote one contact: 
<br>"Iran knows Turkey is not going to walk away."  On the other 
<br>hand, our contacts also concluded that Iranian 
<br>decision-making responds at least tactically to multilateral 
<br>pressure, which argues that Turkey can and should play a key 
<br>role to play in supporting tougher approaches on Iran at the 
<br>UNSC and IAEA.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>Views from Contacts on Turkey-Iran Relations 
<br>--------------------------------------------- 
<br>¶2.  (C) Over the past several weeks, in conversations before 
<br>and after President Ahmadinejad's November 8-9 visit to 
<br>Istanbul (ref B), ConGen Istanbul's NEA Iran Watcher has 
<br>solicited views from a wide range of Turkish and Iranian 
<br>contacts on the issue of warming Turkey-Iran relations, what 
<br>motivates each side, and whether Turkey's approach has led to 
<br>a moderation of Iranian regime behavior.  Contacts with whom 
<br>we spoke included Turkish academic experts, Turkish 
<br>businessmen who deal with Iran, Istanbul-based journalists 
<br>who cover Iran, several Iranian political activists now 
<br>seeking refugee status in Turkey for fear of persecution in 
<br>Iran, and several Tehran-based Iranian contacts who follow 
<br>Iran's foreign policy.  Our conversations revealed an unusual 
<br>confluence of views. 
<br> 
<br>Turkey's Motivations 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>¶3.  (C) According to a number of Turkish academic and 
<br>think-tank contacts, Turkey is pursuing closer relations with 
<br>Iran for several mutually-reinforcing reasons.  First, the 
<br>underlying principle:  According to a Turkish university 
<br>professor who informally advises FM Davutoglu on Middle East 
<br>issues (ref C), Turkey's pursuit of close relations with Iran 
<br>is a direct reflection of Davutoglu's academic philosophy and 
<br>influential 2000 book, "Strategic Depth," in which he first 
<br>articulated a policy of "zero problems" with Turkey's 
<br>neighbors.  Another Istanbul-based professor told us that 
<br>Turkey's Iran policy represents "a triumph of real-politik," 
<br>with Turkey's national and regional interests trumping any 
<br>discomfort that Turkey, as a multi-ethnic, pluralistic 
<br>democracy, might feel about the Iranian regime's harsh 
<br>domestic authoritarianism.  This contact described Davutoglu 
<br>as "Turkey's Kissinger." 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Regional Stability and Conflict Avoidance:  Turkish 
<br>contacts, and indeed even MFA interlocutors, have 
<br>acknowledged in the recent past that Turkey sees a military 
<br>attack against Iran's nuclear facilities as the worst 
<br>possible outcome on the Iran issue.  Iran's acquisition of a 
<br>nuclear weapons capability would only be the second worst 
<br>outcome.  This hints at the depth of Turkey's anxiety about 
<br>the dangers to regional stability, including Turkey's, of the 
<br>unintended consequences of any further military action in the 
<br>region, and explains Turkey's commitment at almost any cost 
<br>to continued western diplomatic engagement with Iran.  As one 
<br>contact explained, "After the traumatic violence in Iraq, and 
<br>fearful that some countries still think military action is an 
<br>option with Iran, Turkey will do anything to prevent armed 
<br>conflict."  The GoT's approach on this score enjoys some 
<br>public support:  Turkish public opinion also considers an 
<br>attack against Iran as more dangerous to Turkey than Iran 
<br>acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.  Indeed, almost a 
<br>third of Turks polled do not consider a nuclear-armed Iran to 
<br>be a threat, believing that Iran would never attack a fellow 
<br>Muslim country. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Recognition of Turkey as Moderate Regional Leader and 
<br>Indispensable East-West Bridge:  According to an Ankara-based 
<br> 
<br>ISTANBUL 00000440  002 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>international relations professor with ties to PM Erdogan's 
<br>office, Turkey is also deepening ties to Iran because the 
<br>region otherwise faces a "power vacuum."  No other regional 
<br>state (e.g. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq) has the military and 
<br>economic power to serve as an effective counterweight to 
<br>Iran.  Turkey fills this role with the support of regional 
<br>states who otherwise fear a dominant Iran, including the Gulf 
<br>States and to some degree Iran's own client, Syria. 
<br>Moreover, he described Turkey's engagement with Iran as part 
<br>of a wider effort to stake out a regional leadership position 
<br>that puts Turkey "at the fulcrum" and makes it an 
<br>indispensable partner for the west -- whether or not Turkey 
<br>eventually joins the EU -- in dealing with the Middle East 
<br>and Central Asia.  This contact acknowledged that this 
<br>sometimes requires Turkey to tactically distance itself from 
<br>the USG on several key issues, including Iran's "right" to 
<br>enrichment and the regime's dismal human rights record.  But 
<br>our contact underscored that "this is classic triangulation." 
<br> Turkey's intention, he claims, is not a strategic distancing 
<br>from the US. 
<br>¶6.  (C) Strengthening a long-term energy and commercial 
<br>relationship:  Turkey does not hide the fact that its own 
<br>growing energy security needs compel it to look to all 
<br>available sources, including Iran, for energy.  In response, 
<br>we have underscored that the USG supports the diversification 
<br>of Turkish gas supplies, while cautioning that Iran has 
<br>proven to be an unreliable partner in the past and 
<br>reaffirming USG concern over new energy deals with Iran. 
<br>Turkey is also actively seeking to expand trade ties with 
<br>Iran:  Both Turkish and Iranian officials have publicly 
<br>called for bilateral trade volume, which was $10 billion in 
<br>2008, to reach $20 billion by 2012 -- a goal most trade 
<br>experts say is wildly unrealistic.  Furthermore, Turkey is 
<br>taking steps to protect and expand financial ties with Iran, 
<br>for example by continuing to allow Iran's Bank Mellat 
<br>(sanctioned by the USG under E.O. 13382) to operate branches 
<br>in Istanbul and Ankara, and agreeing to conduct bilateral 
<br>trade in Turkish Lira or Iranian Rials rather than dollars 
<br>and Euros to avoid having to clear the payments through US or 
<br>European banks. 
<br>¶7.  (C) Tying Iran into regional organizations:  As long as 
<br>Davutoglu controls Turkish foreign policy, our Turkish 
<br>contacts predict that Ankara will seek multiple avenues for 
<br>bilateral and multilateral engagement with Iran, deepening 
<br>bilateral cultural and economic ties, and working with 
<br>regional organizations like the D-8 (ref D), the Economic 
<br>Cooperation Organization (ref E) and the OIC to maximize 
<br>engagement.  Indeed, Davutoglu's MFA sees regional IOs like 
<br>these as much more useful tools for engaging Iran, and thus 
<br>committing Iran incrementally to pursue regionally 
<br>cooperative policies, than previous FMs did, according to 
<br>contacts. 
<br> 
<br>Iran's Motivations 
<br>------------------ 
<br>¶8.   (C) According to our Turkish and Iranian contacts, Iran 
<br>is happy to reciprocate Turkey's interest in closer ties 
<br>because it sees Turkey as a hedge against its diplomatic 
<br>isolation, a buffer against sanctions, and a safety valve for 
<br>its population.  Turkey's value to Iran is felt most strongly 
<br>in these six areas: 
<br>--Economic:  Iran recognizes Turkey's emergence as a regional 
<br>economic powerhouse, wants to deepen Turkey's dependence on 
<br>its natural gas, and sees Turkish markets and bilateral 
<br>commerce as a hedge against isolation and sanctions; 
<br>-- Diplomatic:  Iran knows that Turkey's seats on the UNSC 
<br>and IAEA Board give it outsized influence, and Iran benefits 
<br>from the occasional inclination of Turkish leaders to give 
<br>Iran's nuclear intentions, at least in public, the benefit of 
<br>the doubt; 
<br>-- Political:  Turkey's refusal to publicly criticize the 
<br>regime over the conduct of June elections or its crackdown on 
<br>peaceful protesters, as well as PM Edogan's quick recognition 
<br>of Ahmadinejad's contested election victory, helped bolster 
<br>Iranian regime legitimacy at a critical period when the 
<br>regime needed it most; 
<br>--  Cultural:  A quarter of Iran's population is ethnically 
<br>Azeri and Turkish-speaking; Turkish TV programs and are among 
<br>the most popular in Iran; and one million Iranians flock 
<br>annually visa-free to Turkey as a touristic "safety valve"; 
<br>-- Turkey's strategic importance to the U.S: Iran closely 
<br>watched the spring 2009 visits to Turkey by Secretary Clinton 
<br>and then President Obama.  One direct result of those visits, 
<br>according to an Iranian journalist based in Istanbul, was a 
<br>decision by the regime to try to use Turkey's enhanced 
<br>influence with the USG to "soften" Washington's approach to 
<br>Iran.

<br> 
<br> 
<br>The Limits of Turkish Influence On Iran 
<br>--------------------------- 
<br>¶9.  (C) Turkey's influence with Iran runs broadly, but does 
<br>not appear to run deep.  None of our contacts had seen 
<br>concrete evidence that Turkey has swayed Iranian leaders to 
<br>change course on any issue of strategic interest to the 
<br>regime where Iran had not already calculated it was in its 
<br>interests to do so. 
<br> 
<br>¶10. (C) An Istanbul-based professor who informally advises 
<br>Davutoglu, and joined him in his September and October bilats 
<br>(in Tehran and Kuala Lumpur) with Iranian FM Mottaki, claimed 
<br>that Davutoglu's interventions helped persuade the regime to 
<br>agree to participate in the October 1 Geneva meeting with the 
<br>P5 1.  However, all other contacts dismissed that claim, 
<br>noting that Iranian regime statements and press reports prior 
<br>to Davutoglu's bilats already indicated that Iran would go to 
<br>Geneva. 
<br> 
<br>¶11. (C) Several weeks of intense, personal diplomacy by FM 
<br>Davutoglu, supported by interventions form President Gul and 
<br>PM Erdogan, have been unable to persuade Iranian 
<br>decision-makers  to agree to a compromise deal with Turkey 
<br>that would keep alive the IAEA's Tehran Research Reactor 
<br>(TRR) fuel swap proposal, a key test of the P5 1's efforts to 
<br>engage Iran. 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (C) Our contact who advises Davutoglu also asserted that 
<br>Turkey played a key role in persuading Iran to release 
<br>several detainees including Greek-British journalist Iason 
<br>Athanasiadis (jailed in Iran on June 17 and released on July 
<br>6).  But Athanasiadis (please protect) told us that while 
<br>Turkey offered to intervene with Iran on his case, to his 
<br>knowledge it never did, and indeed Athanasiadis told us he 
<br>believed it was the Ecumenical Patriarch's personal request 
<br>to Khamenei (via letter) that probably convinced Iran to 
<br>release him. 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) Even on issues of lesser strategic importance to 
<br>Iran, high-level Turkish intervention does not reveal a 
<br>record of successfully moderating Iranian policies. 
<br>According to a Turkish businessman who deals with Iran (Ref 
<br>F), several interventions from Turkey's Trade and Foreign 
<br>Ministers, and even a plea from PM Erdogan in Tehran on 
<br>October 27, have been unable to persuade Iran to lower its 
<br>customs duties on Turkish imports, currently 45% for finished 
<br>products. As our business contact explained, even though Iran 
<br>depends on Turkish diplomatic support and benefits from 
<br>Turkish gas purchases and other trade, Iran realizes it does 
<br>not have to sacrifice any critical policy priorities in 
<br>return, including its customs income, because "Iran knows 
<br>Turkey is not going to walk away." 
<br> 
<br>Does Turkey Really Understand Iran Better? 
<br>--------------------------------------- 
<br>¶14.  (C) Underlying Turkey's pursuit of warmer relations with 
<br>Iran is an assumption on the part of Turkish decision-makers 
<br>and diplomats that Turkey has correctly judged that the 
<br>current Iranian regime will be its long-term interlocutor. 
<br>But Turkey's belief that it understands Iranian political 
<br>developments better than most western countries is an 
<br>assumption strongly challenged by our Iranian contacts. 
<br>These contacts suggest that Turkey draws its assessment of 
<br>Iran's internal dynamics through a subjective filter, which 
<br>values regime stability foremost, and thus Turkey's 
<br>assessments artificially inflate evidence suggestive of 
<br>regime stability. 
<br> 
<br>¶15.  (C) According to two separate "Green Movement" activists 
<br>now seeking refugee status in Turkey -- one a Mousavi 
<br>campaign official, one the communications director of a 
<br>reformist party that supported Mousavi -- Turkey missed an 
<br>historic opportunity by quickly recognizing Ahmadinejad's 
<br>victory and dismissing the Green Movement's political 
<br>significance, either as a meaningful opposition movement or 
<br>as the possible vanguard of a more democratic Iranian 
<br>government.  Most Green Movement activists now see Turkey as 
<br>fully committed to the Iranian regime's survival in the name 
<br>of regional stability, and predict that Turkey will be "on 
<br>the wrong side of history" if and when Iran's fractured 
<br>regime faces systemic change at the hands of Iran's 
<br>population.  "When the system falls and a more democratic, 
<br>moderate, outward-looking government comes to power, we will 
<br>all remember where Turkey stood on 22 Khordad (June 12) and 
<br>after." 
<br>¶16.  (C) Turkey, like the USG, almost certainly recognizes 
<br>that within the Iranian regime there are at least several 
<br>factions and key players jockeying intensely for influence. 
<br> 
<br>ISTANBUL 00000440  004 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>The fact that Turkish President Gul agreed to meet former 
<br>Iranian presidential candidate Mohsen Rezai, a Rafsanjani 
<br>ally, in Ankara in October (despite the INTERPOL Red Notice 
<br>issued against Rezai), and the relative frequency with which 
<br>Turkish officials including PM Erdogan have met influential 
<br>Majles speaker Larijani, an Ahmadinejad rival, in the past 
<br>six months, suggest that Turkey -- like others in the west -- 
<br>wants to hedge its bets on who will emerge as the strongest 
<br>of Iran's decision-makers, especially if Supreme Leader 
<br>Khamenei faces future leadership challenges.  (In a telling 
<br>anecdote related to us indirectly, when Erdogan met Khamenei 
<br>in Tehran on October 28, Khamenei seemed to be "in a time 
<br>capsule", asking uninformed or unrealistic questions about 
<br>Turkish foreign policy, and passively uninterested in 
<br>discussing the nuclear issue.)  Despite its belief that it 
<br>knows its neighbor Iran better than most other countries do, 
<br>according to our contacts, Turkey is just as uncertain as the 
<br>USG and other western countries as to what exactly is 
<br>happening behind the regime's closed doors. 
<br> 
<br>Implications 
<br>---------- 
<br>¶17.  (C) If the consensus views of our contacts are accurate, 
<br>it suggests our efforts to persuade PM Erdogan to adopt a 
<br>tougher public stance against Iran will be a tough sell. 
<br>Even if Erdogan were to hew closer to P5-plus-one criticism 
<br>of Iran, Tehran would likely pay him little heed.  On the 
<br>other hand, our contacts point out that Iran's regime has a 
<br>clear recent history of making tactical concessions in the 
<br>face of concerted international pressure, especially pressure 
<br>from the UNSC and IAEA.  If this holds true, we can and 
<br>should encourage Turkey to play a supportive role at the UNSC 
<br>and IAEA as the USG and partners consider raising pressure on 
<br>Iran in those fora.  As noted Ref G, however, any USG effort 
<br>to try press Turkey to sign up to tougher international 
<br>measures on Iran, especially on issues that might impact the 
<br>Turkish economy, will have  costly domestic political 
<br>consequences for the GoT.  The key to securing Turkish 
<br>acquiescence at the UNSC and IAEA, a Turkish professor 
<br>explained, is to keep the engagement track on the table and 
<br>even further sweetened (especially with trade incentives from 
<br>which Turkey might also benefit), even as tougher measures 
<br>are being pursued.
