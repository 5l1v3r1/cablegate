<br>PARIS 00001473  001.3 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Classified By: Ambassador Charles H. Rivkin, for reasons 
<br>1.4(b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (S/NF)  SUMMARY.  Madam Secretary, your Paris Embassy and 
<br>the French are eager to welcome you to 
<br>France.  FM Kouchner quickly invited you to lunch or a 
<br>meeting on Sunday, which is not a usual practice. 
<br>He looks forward to talking with you about key issues, 
<br>including Afghanistan, Iran, and relations with Russia. 
<br>Kouchner recently visited Afghanistan, and he will 
<br>undoubtedly be interested in hearing your insights 
<br>about recent developments there and your views on Pakistan. 
<br>France is our strongest ally in pursuing a 
<br>dual track policy with Iran, and has been helpful in rallying 
<br>Europe to a more clear-eyed assessment of Iran's 
<br>nuclear ambitions.  Paris welcomed the U.S. "reset" with 
<br>Russia and views Moscow as a strategic partner 
<br>that cannot be ignored.  End Summary. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>SARKOZY AND KOUCHNER 
<br>-------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) FM Kouchner, coming from the opposition Socialist 
<br>Party, is regularly polled as one of the 
<br>most popular French politicians and is a high-profile example 
<br>of Sarkozy's successful policy of outreach to 
<br>the leaders of other political parties.  He has a solid 
<br>working relationship with the demanding French President. 
<br>Kouchner has also carved out specific areas where he has 
<br>largely free rein and which play to his strengths and 
<br>previous experience, including in humanitarian affairs, the 
<br>Balkans, and democratization efforts.  Despite these 
<br>positives, we have occasionally witnessed lapses in 
<br>communication between the two offices due to Sarkozy's 
<br>tendency to seize the initiative and "speak first, consult 
<br>later" and his penchant for proposing high-level 
<br>summits to cut through bureaucratic red tape. 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (S/NF) Both Sarkozy and Kouchner are committed to a 
<br>strong Europe with a strong transatlantic 
<br>relationship with the U.S.  Both see Europe as our closest, 
<br>most natural partner in fighting terrorism 
<br>in Afghanistan and piracy on the high seas, or promoting 
<br>peace as part of the Middle East Peace process 
<br>quartet, fighting Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions, and in 
<br>stabilizing the Balkans.  Likewise, they view France, 
<br>and neighboring Germany, as the natural leaders of Europe. 
<br>Kouchner and Sarkozy both have a pragmatic approach to 
<br>problems, characterized by a high degree of "hands on" 
<br>personal involvement in the issues that interest them. 
<br>Your visit will give FM Kouchner an opportunity to showcase 
<br>his close ties to you and to the Obama 
<br>administration, vindicating France's unabashed "pro-American" 
<br>stance, which is a significant reversal 
<br>from the Chirac years when France defined its power more in 
<br>opposition to, rather than collaboration with, the 
<br>United States. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>AFGHANISTAN: SAME GOALS, LIMITED RESOURCES 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C/NF) FM Kouchner was in Afghanistan on October 17-18 on 
<br>a "purely political" trip designed to consult 
<br>with the main presidential candidates and to move the 
<br>electoral process forward.  He cooperated closely 
<br>with Senator Kerry to send a combined message of support for 
<br>the acceptance of a second round of voting. 
<br>Afghanistan remains a high foreign policy priority for the 
<br>French government, but they have difficulty 
<br>translating their interest into additional concrete military 
<br>and civilian support.  French government 
<br>officials, including both President Sarkozy and FM Kouchner, 
<br>have long advocated that "there is no 
<br>purely military solution" to Afghanistan.  When it comes to 
<br>putting resources behind the statement, 
<br>however, the French government has limited options, due to 
<br>political maneuvering and real economic 
<br>constraints.  As a sop to his own party in exchange for 
<br>support for French reintegration into NATO this 
<br>April, Sarkozy has publicly and repeatedly promised "not to 
<br>send one extra soldier" to fight an 
<br>unpopular war in Afghanistan.  This is now a political line 
<br>French leaders will not cross, although their 
<br>military has privately expressed both the will and the 
<br>capacity for further contributions.  To 
<br>compensate, the GOF is currently shifting some of its troops 
<br>from a security posture in Kabul 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00001473  002.2 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>to more active combat roles in the east, where the bulk of 
<br>their 3,000 troops are now located.  In March, 
<br>President Sarkozy created France's first 
<br>politically-appointed Special Representative to Afghanistan 
<br>and Pakistan, 
<br>a post now held by Sarkozy crony UMP deputy Thierry Mariani. 
<br>Kouchner fought this appointment 
<br>in favor of a career diplomat because political appointments 
<br>in the French parliamentary system 
<br>are limited to six months in length, limiting the 
<br>effectiveness of the position as it currently 
<br>functions. 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C/NF)  There is great interest, particularly within the 
<br>MFA and from Kouchner personally, 
<br>to increase French civilian development assistance to 
<br>Afghanistan, with a focus on raising the salaries 
<br>of Afghan police and other security forces.  However, these 
<br>goals are tempered by very limited 
<br>resources.  After a battle with the Finance Ministry, the MFA 
<br>succeeded in restoring French 
<br>civilian assistance to Afghanistan to previous modest levels 
<br>of 40 million euros (58.4 million U.S. dollars) 
<br>after budget cuts threatened to limit French assistance to 
<br>only 10 million Euros this year (about 14.6 million U.S. 
<br>dollars).  One additional area for growth is the deployment 
<br>by December 1 of the bulk of the 150 French gendarmes 
<br>who make up part of the European Gendarmerie Force for police 
<br>training.  They will be joined soon by Italian 
<br>carabinieri and possibly small contributions from other 
<br>countries in the coming year.  President Sarkozy is 
<br>expected to finally take a long-delayed trip to the region 
<br>next spring. 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C/NF) In September, the French President joined his 
<br>German and UK counterparts to propose a conference on 
<br>Afghanistan by the end of the year.  Kouchner wanted to bring 
<br>other Foreign Ministers to Paris to meet you to 
<br>pursue this European goal.  French officials have since 
<br>stated that if the security situation allows, they would 
<br>like the conference to take place in Kabul as soon as 
<br>possible, with a possible second session taking place 
<br>later, after the Afghan government is better able to 
<br>prioritize its work plan and strategy. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>PAKISTAN: COIN AND CIVILIAN LOANS 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C/NF)  On Pakistan, the French are relative newcomers 
<br>who have requested close cooperation with the UK and United 
<br>States, particularly in areas of counter-terrorism and 
<br>counter-insurgency assistance.  France is providing 
<br>military assistance and security cooperation to Pakistan, in 
<br>addition to civilian emergency and humanitarian aid. 
<br>Paris officials complain that Pakistani cooperation in 
<br>combating the Afghan Taliban refuged in their country 
<br>is weak, if not non-existent.  France has given about five 
<br>million euros (7.3 million U.S. dollars) in emergency and 
<br>reconstruction assistance to Pakistan this year.  France has 
<br>also increased its concessionary loan commitments to Pakistan 
<br>since the April Tokyo conference from 200 to 382 million 
<br>euros (573 million U.S. dollars).  The loans cover 
<br>nine projects in the areas of hydroelectricity and energy 
<br>efficiency.  France is still also dispensing funds 
<br>made under soft loans worth 11 million euros (16 million U.S. 
<br>dollars) for post-earthquake reconstruction; it is not yet 
<br>ready to contribute to the World Bank-administered 
<br>multi-donor trust fund for Pakistan as it was not clear who 
<br>their 
<br>partners on the Pakistani side would be and what safeguards 
<br>there would be over the funds. 
<br> 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br>IRAN: FEARS THAT WE ARE LOSING GROUND 
<br>-------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (S/NF)  In their October 14 phone call, Presidents 
<br>Sarkozy and Obama agreed that if Iran 
<br>responds negatively to the uranium enrichment deal on the 
<br>table, then we must take more serious measures, including 
<br>additional sanctions.  Senior French officials believe that 
<br>we are losing traction on this issue within the 
<br>international community, as countries continue to engage in 
<br>normal diplomatic and commercial relations 
<br>with Iran (exemplified by Chinese business interests, Turkish 
<br>PM Erdogan's recent visit to Iran, and Iranian 
<br>President Ahmedinejad's planned trip to Brazil in late 
<br>November).  Sarkozy's position is bolstered by his staunch 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00001473  003.2 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>belief in non-proliferation (to maintain France's own 
<br>deterrent capability), his real concern about the threat to 
<br>Israel, and his personal ire at the way Iran has tried to 
<br>manipulate France, including by holding French citizen 
<br>Clotilde Reiss and Franco-Iranian dual national Nazak Afshar 
<br>for alleged illegal participation in this summer's 
<br>street protests.  Some senior French officials have suggested 
<br>that Sarkozy's tough line can be useful as "the 
<br>pointy edge of the sword" in meeting the Iranian challenge. 
<br>As we plan next steps on Iran, Kouchner will 
<br>likely be interested in your readout of your recent 
<br>discussions in Moscow as well as the latest efforts to 
<br>bring China on board. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>PUSHING ENGAGEMENT WITH RUSSIA 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶9.  (C/NF)  French policy toward Russia under President 
<br>Sarkozy reflects the belief that engagement with Moscow is 
<br>the best way to influence Russian behavior.  Paris has 
<br>welcomed U.S. efforts to "re-set" relations with Russia and 
<br>has consistently emphasized developing a common approach with 
<br>Washington toward Moscow.  French officials maintain 
<br>that dialogue must underpin our efforts to elicit Moscow's 
<br>cooperation; this is particularly true on European 
<br>security, an area in which Sarkozy -- who last year proposed 
<br>an OSCE summit on the issue -- seeks to exert 
<br>French leadership. French priorities for strategic dialogue 
<br>with Moscow include promoting economic 
<br>cooperation; encouraging Russia to work through institutions 
<br>with set rules; supporting Russian 
<br>actions in public while taking a more honest approach in 
<br>private meetings; and cultivating relations with Russian 
<br>President Dmitri Medvedev, in the hope that he can become a 
<br>leader independent of Vladimir Putin. Putin is due in 
<br>Paris later this month, Sarkozy will go to Moscow in 
<br>February, and Medvedev will visit France in March 2010. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br>AN URGENT FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE 
<br>----------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶10.  (SBU) The French remain divided on how to respond to the 
<br>Obama Administration's approaches to climate change. 
<br>Most of the interested public and many in the government 
<br>believe that interim 2020 reduction targets, and the level 
<br>of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and concentrations at that 
<br>time, will determine success or failure in slowing 
<br>global warming.  For them, the EU's target of 20 to 30 
<br>percent reductions below 1990 is the sole measure of an 
<br>acceptable policy.  Even sophisticated observers are 
<br>skeptical that long-term reduction goals legislated in the 
<br>United States can be counted on as more than aspirations, 
<br>especially if radical cuts are not imposed up front.  We 
<br>have reiterated that U.S. laws are reliably enforced by the 
<br>Federal government and by U.S. courts, using the Clean 
<br>Air Act as our example.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
<br>officials agree that legislation moving through Congress 
<br>and the Administration's proposals would establish a system 
<br>comparable to the EU's measures.  These officials 
<br>regard Environment Minister Jean-Louis Borloo's public 
<br>criticisms of Waxman-Markey as "insufficient on the medium 
<br>term goal" as distracting attention from the need for China 
<br>and India to reduce their rates of growth in GHG 
<br>emissions. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br>WANTS TO BE A PLAYER IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
<br>------------------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶11.  (S/NF)  The GOF is eager to engage with the United 
<br>States on the Middle East peace process and worries we are 
<br>not moving fast enough.  President Sarkozy and FM Kouchner 
<br>continue to press for a Middle East peace summit before the 
<br>end of the year, to be held under the auspices of the Union 
<br>for the Mediterranean, of which Egypt and France are 
<br>currently co-chairs.  A sense of frustration and ambition 
<br>informs the French approach toward the Middle East peace 
<br>process: they are frustrated that they must rely on the USG 
<br>and on stubborn parties in the region to end a conflict 
<br>whose persistence adversely affects their national interests, 
<br>and they are ambitious to play a larger role in 
<br>the peace process, in order to facilitate a successful 
<br>outcome and to enjoy the prestige that such a role would 
<br>earn them.  As a case in point, last week Kouchner had to 
<br>cancel a planned visit to Israel and the Palestinian 
<br>territories in part because of the continuing tension there, 
<br>and in part because of Israel's refusal to allow him 
<br> 
<br>PARIS 00001473  004.2 OF 004 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>to visit a French hospital in Gaza.  Nonetheless, aside from 
<br>their criticism of the pace at which we have proceeded 
<br>with negotiations, French officials continue to take concrete 
<br>steps to support our efforts to broker peace among 
<br>the various states and groups in the region: they have 
<br>consistently affirmed our leadership role in their own 
<br>bilateral contacts, in multilateral fora, and in public and 
<br>private statements. 
<br> 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br>INCREASING CONCERNS ABOUT U.S. FOCUS ON DISARMAMENT 
<br>--------------------------------------------- ------ 
<br> 
<br>¶12.  (S/NF) French officials are increasingly concerned that 
<br>the Obama administration's commitment to an eventual 
<br>"world free of nuclear weapons" represents a divergence from 
<br>the French position on a strong deterrence policy. 
<br>Furthermore, they worry that a focus on disarmament goals by 
<br>legitimate nuclear weapons states will pressure them to 
<br>cut their own modest arsenal and will serve as a distraction 
<br>from serious proliferation concerns by states 
<br>like North Korea and Iran.  The GOF would like to use every 
<br>available forum, including the 2010 NPT Review Conference, 
<br>to strongly and specifically rebuke Iran and North Korea (and 
<br>were greatly disappointed by our decision not to do so 
<br>at the September 24 UNSC summit).  Additionally, France is 
<br>"psychologically" committed to a deterrent force 
<br>as a symbol of its strategic independence and they will 
<br>strive to maintain the "legitimacy" of nuclear weapons as a 
<br>key element of military strategy.  Any suggestion that 
<br>bilateral U.S.-Russian arms reduction talks should 
<br>eventually include other nuclear powers, or that an FMCT 
<br>should address existing stockpiles, are absolute redlines 
<br>for the French. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br>A PARTNER IN AFRICA 
<br>------------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶13.  (C) France is struggling somewhat to implement Sarkozy's 
<br>vision of a new approach to Africa, in part 
<br>because of recent governance crises in a number of 
<br>Francophone countries, including Mauritania, Gabon, 
<br>Madagascar, Niger, and Guinea, where the need for expediency 
<br>in bringing stability can sometimes trump 
<br>loftier principles.  We are still waiting to see if France 
<br>will, in fact close down one of its military bases on the 
<br>Atlantic side, in Senegal or Gabon in an effort to streamline 
<br>its presence in Africa.  That said, France is a 
<br>progressively more open interlocutor on Africa and there are 
<br>many areas where we are working closely, including 
<br>pushing for a transitional government in Guinea, supporting 
<br>efforts to deter sexual violence, and, increasingly, 
<br>coordinating on addressing the AQIM threat in Mali and 
<br>Mauritania.  The MFA's initial response to our new Sudan 
<br>strategy is positive.  France, as the leader of the EU's anti 
<br>piracy effort off the Horn of Africa is an 
<br>important partner on counter-piracy and maritime security 
<br>issues.
