<br>Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Gustavo Delgado.
<br>Reason: 1.4 (b),(d).
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary. Mexican Navy forces acting on U.S.
<br>information killed Arturo Beltran Leyva in an operation on
<br>December 16, the highest-level takedown of a cartel figure
<br>under the Calderon administration. The operation is a clear
<br>victory for the Mexican Government and an example of
<br>excellent USG-GOM cooperation. The unit that conducted the
<br>operation had recieved extensive U.S. training. Arturo
<br>Beltran Leyva's death will not solve Mexico's drug problem,
<br>but it will hopefully generate the momentum necessary to make
<br>sustained progress against other drug trafficking
<br>organizations. End Summary.
<br>
<br>The Operation
<br>-------------
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Mexican Navy (SEMAR) sources revealed on the night of
<br>December 17 that SEMAR forces killed Arturo Beltran Leyva
<br>(ABL), head of the Beltran Leyva Organization, during a
<br>shoot-out in Cuernavaca (approximately 50 miles south of
<br>Mexico City) that afternoon. At least three other cartel
<br>operatives were killed during the raid, with a fourth
<br>committing suicide. While it still has not been confirmed,
<br>Embassy officials believe the latter to be ABL's brother,
<br>Hector, which would mean that all Beltran Leyva brothers are
<br>either dead or in prison. Arturo Beltran Leyva has a long
<br>history of involvement in the Mexican drug trade, and worked
<br>with Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and his Sinaloa Cartel before
<br>splitting in 2008. The rivalry between the Sinaloa and
<br>Beltran Leyva organizations has been a key factor driving the
<br>escalating levels of narcotics-related violence in recent
<br>years. Born in Sinaloa, ABL has been key to the importation
<br>and distribution of cocaine and heroin in the United States,
<br>and also has extensive money laundering capabilities,
<br>corruption networks, and international contacts in Colombia
<br>and the U.S.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Embassy law enforcement officials say that the arrest
<br>operation targeting ABL began about a week prior to his death
<br>when the Embassy relayed detailed information on his location
<br>to SEMAR. The SEMAR unit has been trained extensively by
<br>NORTHCOM over the past several years. SEMAR raided an
<br>identified location, where they killed several ABL bodyguards
<br>and arrested over 23 associates, while ABL and Hector
<br>escaped. On Monday, the Embassy interagency linked ABL to an
<br>apartment building located in Cuernavaca (about an hour south
<br>of Mexico City), where ABL was in hiding. SEMAR initiated an
<br>arrest operation on Wednesday afternoon, surrounding the
<br>identified apartment complex, and establishing a security
<br>perimeter. ABL's forces fired on the SEMAR operatives and
<br>engaged in a sustained firefight that wounded three SEMAR
<br>marines and possibly killed one. SEMAR forces evacuated
<br>residents of the apartment complex to the gym, according to
<br>press accounts, and no civilian casualties have so far been
<br>reported.
<br>
<br>The Mexican Interagency
<br>-----------------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) The successful operation against ABL comes on the
<br>heels of an aggressive SEMAR effort in Monterrey against Zeta
<br>forces (ref a) and highlights its emerging role as a key
<br>player in the counternarcotics fight. SEMAR is well-trained,
<br>well-equipped, and has shown itself capable of responding
<br>quickly to actionable intelligence. Its success puts the
<br>Army (SEDENA) in the difficult position of explaining why it
<br>has been reluctant to act on good intelligence and conduct
<br>operations against high-level targets. The U.S. interagency
<br>originally provided the information to SEDENA, whose refusal
<br>to move quickly reflected a risk aversion that cost the
<br>institution a major counternarcotics victory. SEDENA did
<br>provide backup to SEMAR during the firefight with ABL forces,
<br>but can take little credit for the operation. Public
<br>Security Secretary (SSP) Genaro Garcia Luna can also be
<br>counted as a net loser in the Mexican interagency following
<br>the ABL operation. SSP considers high-level Beltran Leyva
<br>targets to be its responsibility, and Garcia Luna has already
<br>
<br>MEXICO 00003573 002 OF 003
<br>
<br>
<br>said privately that the operation should have been his.
<br>
<br>The Impact on Violence
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) It is early to say with a great degree of confidence
<br>what kind of effect ABL's death will have on levels of
<br>narco-related violence in Mexico. A spike is probably likely
<br>in the short term as inter- and intra-cartel battles are
<br>intensified by the sudden leadership gap in one of the
<br>country's most important cartels. With all the Beltran Leyva
<br>brothers likely dead or in prison, there are a number of
<br>other cartel functionaries likely to vie for the leadership
<br>slot. Moreover, rival organizations may intensify efforts to
<br>expand their influence in the disarray likely to follow ABL's
<br>death. At the very least, efforts to clean the Beltran Leyva
<br>house and rout out suspected informers will be bloody, and
<br>retaliation by the organization against Mexican law
<br>enforcement or military officials is not out of the cards.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) In the medium to longer term, ABL's death could have
<br>the potential to lower the level of narco-violence rates.
<br>ABL himself was a particularly violent leader with numerous
<br>effective assassin teams. Moreover, the Sinaloa-Beltran
<br>Leyva rivalry has been responsible for a large number of
<br>narcotics-related homicides in Mexico, and also largely
<br>personally driven by the Beltran Leyva brothers themselves.
<br>Emboffs speculate that Beltran Leyva associates, under
<br>pressure and perhaps more vulnerable due to leadership
<br>deficiencies, could move to align more closely again with
<br>Sinaloa, which they might think offers a more natural
<br>protection than the Zetas.
<br>
<br>The Boost for Calderon
<br>----------------------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) SEMAR's successful operation against ABL is a major
<br>victory for President Calderon and his war against organized
<br>crime. ABL is the highest ranking target taken down by the
<br>Calderon government, and his status as one of the most
<br>important and long-standing of Mexican drug traffickers makes
<br>his takedown even more symbolically important. President
<br>Calderon has openly admitted to having a tough year -- his
<br>party lost big in the midterm elections, he is confronting an
<br>economic crisis, and nationwide homicide rates continue to
<br>climb -- and contacts have told Poloff that he has seemed
<br>"down" in meetings. The SEMAR operation is undoubtedly a
<br>huge boost for him, both in terms of bolstering public
<br>support for his security efforts and in reassuring himself
<br>that important security accomplishments in this area are
<br>possible. Calderon's political opponents will also find it
<br>far less useful to accuse the President of hanging on to an
<br>ineffective anti-crime strategy that nets numerous mid- to
<br>low-level cartel figures but fails to rein in the major
<br>kingpins. The major Mexico City dailies have run front page
<br>Beltran Leyva stories, and President Calderon's remarks in a
<br>press conference from Copenhagen highlighting that the
<br>operation represents an "important achievement for the
<br>Mexican people and government" were widely covered.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) The operation against Arturo Beltran Leyva is a clear
<br>victory for the Mexican Government and an example of
<br>excellent USG-GOM cooperation. Seamless Embassy interagency
<br>collaboration combined with a willing, capable, and ready
<br>SEMAR produced one of the greatest successes to date in the
<br>counternarcotics fight. ABL's death will provide an
<br>important boost to Calderon and hopefully will cultivate a
<br>greater sense of confidence within Mexican security agencies
<br>that will encourage them to take greater advantage of similar
<br>opportunities. SEMAR's win in particular may encourage
<br>SEDENA to be more proactive and less risk averse in future
<br>operations. ABL's death will certainly not resolve Mexico's
<br>drug problem, but it will likely generate the momentum
<br>necessary within the GOM security apparatus to make sustained
<br>and real progress against the country's drug trafficking
<br>organizations.
