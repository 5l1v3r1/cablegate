<br>
<br>¶1.  (S/NF) SUMMARY.  In a September 6 meeting with Deputy
<br>National Security Advisor John Brennan, President Saleh
<br>pledged unfettered access to Yemen's national territory for
<br>U.S. counterterrorism operations, suggesting that in the
<br>process, the USG assumed responsibility for the success - or
<br>failure - of efforts to neutralize AQAP in Yemen.  Saleh
<br>expressed dissatisfaction with the USG's current level of aid
<br>for CT and security operations and insisted the ROYG began
<br>its war against the al-Houthi rebellion in northern Yemen on
<br>behalf of the U.S.  Saleh stated his preference for Saudi
<br>Arabia over Jordan as a potential rehabilitation site for
<br>Guantanamo detainees of Yemeni origin, but claimed the ROYG
<br>was willing and able to accept them in Yemeni prisons.  In a
<br>one-on-one that followed, Brennan extended an invitation to
<br>Saleh to visit President Obama at the White House on October
<br>¶6.  END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>"OPEN LAND, AIR, AND SEA" FOR U.S. STRIKES AGAINST AQAP
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>
<br>¶2.  (S/NF) In a September 6 meeting with Deputy National
<br>Security Advisor John Brennan, President Saleh insisted that
<br>Yemen's national territory is available for unilateral CT
<br>operations by the U.S.  Dissatisfied with current levels of
<br>USG funding and military training provided to the ROYG's CT
<br>forces, Saleh asserted that the USG has produced "only words,
<br>but no solutions" to the terrorism issue in Yemen.  Saleh
<br>repeatedly requested more funds and equipment to fight
<br>al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), while at the same
<br>time placing responsibility for any future AQAP attacks on
<br>the shoulders of the USG now that it enjoys unfettered access
<br>to Yemeni airspace, coastal waters and land.  (NOTE.  The USG
<br>has been actively engaged since 2001 in training elements of
<br>Yemen's CT forces, including the Counter-Terrorism Unit
<br>(CTU), the Yemen Special Operations Force (YSOF), the
<br>Presidential Guard, the Yemeni Border Troops, Yemen Air Force
<br>(YAF), and the Yemen Coast Guard (YCG). The USG has expended
<br>over $115 million equipping CT forces since FY02.  In 2009
<br>alone, U.S. teams have instructed Yemeni CT forces in
<br>training valued at $5 million.  END NOTE.)
<br>
<br>¶3.  (S/NF) While Saleh offered assurances that the ROYG is
<br>"determined to continue the war against al-Qaeda because
<br>they're targeting U.S. and Yemeni interests," he continued to
<br>link increased U.S. access to AQAP targets with full
<br>responsibility for achieving CT goals.  Highlighting the
<br>potential for a future AQAP attack on the U.S. Embassy or
<br>other Western targets, Saleh said, "I have given you an open
<br>door on terrorism, so I am not responsible."
<br>
<br>THE SA'ADA WAR: "THE HOUTHIS ARE YOUR ENEMIES TOO"
<br>--------------------------------------------- -----
<br>
<br>¶4.  (S/NF) President Saleh expressed his frustration with the
<br>USG refusal to view the Sa'ada war against the al-Houthis in
<br>the north in the same light as the fight against AQAP.
<br>Claiming a need for increased aid and support, Saleh asserted
<br>that "this war we're launching is a war on behalf of the
<br>U.S....the Houthis are your enemies too," citing videos of
<br>al-Houthi followers chanting, "Death to Israel, death to
<br>America."  (NOTE:  The Houthis have not attacked U.S.
<br>interests or personnel in the six rounds of fighting between
<br>the ROYG and the Houthis that began in 2004.  END NOTE.)  The
<br>USG's failure to view the Houthis as terrorists and equip
<br>ROYG forces to fight them in Sa'ada undermines the USG's
<br>claims of friendship and cooperation, according to Saleh.
<br>Commenting on the status of ROYG forces in Sa'ada, Saleh
<br>said, "we are suffering a lot of casualties and loss of
<br>material."  Renewing his requests for armored personnel
<br>vehicles, aircraft, and medical evacuation vehicles, Saleh
<br>echoed his criticism of U.S. efforts. "We need deeds, not
<br>only words," he said.  Brennan responded that the USG is
<br>prohibited by law from providing military support to the ROYG
<br>to be used against the Houthis since the USG considers the
<br>group a domestic insurgency.
<br>
<br>¶5.  (S/NF) Restating claims of Iranian support to the Houthi
<br>movement,  ROYG officials present said they had provided
<br>files supporting an Iranian-Houthi connection to USG
<br>officials and would provide more if necessary.  (NOTE.  The
<br>Ambassador acknowledged receiving a file that was reviewed
<br>here and in Washington; however, no conclusive evidence of an
<br>Iranian-Houthi link has been made from these or other
<br>records.  Brennan said that he would request a fresh scrub of
<br>all available intelligence to see if it turned up any
<br>evidence of Iranian involvement.  END NOTE.)  Saleh said,
<br>"Iran is trying to settle old scores against the U.S. by
<br>ruining relations between Yemen and GCC countries and the
<br>U.S."  He also made a tangential reference to Hezbollah,
<br>claiming the organization's influence in the region also
<br>rendered the ROYG-Houthi war a fight on behalf of the U.S.
<br>Referencing the high poverty rate and illicit arms flows into
<br>both Yemen and Somalia, Saleh concluded by saying, "If you
<br>don't help, this country will become worse than Somalia."
<br>
<br>MUDDLED MESSAGES ON GUANTANAMO DETAINEES
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶6.  (S/NF) Saleh expressed his preference for the existing
<br>Saudi Arabia option as a potential site for rehabilitating
<br>Guantanamo detainees of Yemeni origin over a proposed
<br>Jordanian option, citing closer familial ties and cultural
<br>bonds in Saudi Arabia as mechanisms for more effective
<br>treatment.  Saleh commented that he thought the Jordanians
<br>were &too poor8 to support a rehabilitation program, but
<br>did not dismiss Jordan as an option. However, he signaled
<br>that rehabilitation is not his concern, but rather "the
<br>U.S.'s problem" as he is ready and willing to accept all
<br>Yemeni detainees into the Yemeni prison system.  (COMMENT.
<br>Saleh would, in our judgment, be unable to hold returning
<br>detainees in jail for any more than a matter of weeks before
<br>public pressure ) or the courts ) forced their release.
<br>END COMMENT.)  Saleh urged the USG to design and implement a
<br>rehabilitation and education program for the detainees and to
<br>build a rehabilitation center in Yemen, but reiterated that
<br>the U.S. would have to fund these projects, repeatedly
<br>asking, "How many dollars is the U.S. going to bring?"
<br>However, when Brennan offered $500,000 as an initial
<br>investment currently available for the crafting of a
<br>rehabilitation program, Saleh dismissed the offer as
<br>insufficient.  Saleh also assured Brennan that he was
<br>committed to "freeing the innocent people after a complete
<br>and total rehabilitation," suggesting a lack of clarity on
<br>his own policy and on the status of Guantanamo detainees in
<br>the ROYG legal system.
<br>
<br>ECONOMIC REFORM AND CORRUPTION
<br>------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶7.  (S/NF) Saleh welcomed the letter from President Obama
<br>that Brennan hand-carried, and expressed appreciation for
<br>U.S. concern over the stability and economic hardships facing
<br>the country.  He agreed to move forward with the 10-point
<br>plan outlining necessary economic reforms (reftel) but did
<br>not provide details regarding dates or implementation goals.
<br>Responding to Brennan's concerns that economic and other
<br>assistance might be diverted through corrupt officials to
<br>other purposes, Saleh urged the U.S. to donate supplies and
<br>hardware rather than liquid funds in order to curb
<br>corruption's reach.  Saleh also told US officials that they
<br>could have full access to financial records to ensure proper
<br>usage of donor funding. (COMMENT.  Saleh's preference for
<br>infrastructure and equipment over cash displays a lack of
<br>confidence in his own regime's ability to handle liquid
<br>assets and hardly provides a viable solution for stemming the
<br>curb of corruption in the long run.  END COMMENT.)
<br>
<br>VISIT TO WASHINGTON & OTHER ISSUES
<br>----------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶8.  (S/NF) Saleh again asked to visit the U.S., arguing that
<br>it was necessary to resolve issues regarding the Guantanamo
<br>detainees and increased military assistance.  "We see this
<br>visit as very important to reach mutual understanding and so
<br>that you understand our requests and demands."  Brennan
<br>undertook to look into Saleh's claims of "promised" military
<br>equipment that has not been delivered. In a one-on-one
<br>session that followed the formal meeting, Brennan extended an
<br>invitation to Saleh to meet President Obama at the White
<br>House on October 6.  Saleh also stated that there would be no
<br>more delays in the U.S. Embassy's request to purchase lands
<br>for the building of more secure housing facilities and that
<br>the Shari'a Council would approve the transfer of the lands
<br>from waqf (or publicly held) status to free-hold status.
<br>
<br>COMMENT
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶9.  (S/NF) COMMENT.  Saleh was in vintage form during the two
<br>hours he spent with DNSA Brennan, at times disdainful and
<br>dismissive and at others, conciliatory and congenial.  One
<br>might easily conclude that his repeated assertion that
<br>Yemen's national territory is open to the US to conduct
<br>operations against AQAP reflects his interest in outsourcing
<br>the CT effort in Yemen to the USG, especially in view of his
<br>somewhat ominous claim that, should AQAP attacks occur in the
<br>future, they will be the result of the U.S. having failed to
<br>do enough to put the organization out of business.
<br>Additionally, a concerted USG anti-terrorism campaign in
<br>Yemen will free Saleh to continue to devote his limited
<br>security assets to the ongoing war against Houthi rebels in
<br>Sa'ada.  The net effect, and one we strongly suspect Saleh
<br>has calculated, of both the American and ROYG "iron fist"
<br>unleashed at the same time in Yemen will be a clear message
<br>to the southern movement or any other party interested in
<br>generating political unrest in the country that a similar
<br>fate awaits them.
<br>
<br>¶10.  (S/NF) COMMENT CONTINUED.  Not surprisingly, Saleh was
<br>far less animated when Brennan attempted to focus his
<br>attention on the need for immediate action to relieve Yemen's
<br>deteriorating socio-economic situation, largely limiting his
<br>response to a pitch that the USG persuade recalcitrant donors
<br>to speed up and increase their assistance to Yemen.  After
<br>stating petulantly in the group session that he was no longer
<br>interested in an invitation to the White House, telling
<br>Brennan that "my relationship with you is sufficient,"
<br>Saleh's mood changed noticeably for the better when the
<br>invitation was extended, and he had captured the prize he has
<br>been chasing after for months.  END COMMENT.
