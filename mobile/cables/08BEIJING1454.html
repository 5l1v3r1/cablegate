<br>Summary
<br>-------
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) President Hu Jintao remains firmly in charge of
<br>China's policy on Tibet, with the leadership unified over
<br>Beijing's current hard-line stance and buoyed by rising PRC
<br>nationalist sentiment, xxxxx.
<br>Given Hu's background and experience in Tibet, as well as
<br>the "extremely sensitive" nature of the issue, no one would
<br>"dare" challenge Hu or the Party line, contacts say. While
<br>there may be differences in how various leaders publicly
<br>articulate China's Tibet policy, there are no substantive
<br>differences among the top leadership. Similarly, Embassy
<br>sources do not believe that two recent articles in
<br>Party-controlled southern newspapers signaled leadership
<br>debate or a review of policy, instead arguing the pieces
<br>perhaps reflect an adjustment in the Party's media strategy.
<br>The Party has been buoyed by rising nationalist sentiment,
<br>fueled in part by anger at the West over "biased" media
<br>reporting on Tibet and Olympic-related protests, but this
<br>nationalistic fervor also constrains future policy choices.
<br>Regardless, any modification of Tibet policy is unlikely in
<br>the short term, at least until after the Olympics, contacts
<br>say. End Summary.
<br>
<br>Hu Jintao Firmly in Charge, Leadership Unified
<br>--------------------------------------------- -
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) President Hu Jintao is firmly in charge of the PRC's
<br>Tibet policy, with the leadership unified over Beijing's
<br>current hard-line stance, several Embassy contacts told
<br>PolOffs over the past week. Sources argued that given Hu
<br>Jintao's own expertise and experience regarding Tibet (Hu was
<br>provincial party secretary in Tibet in the late 1980s), as
<br>well as the "extreme" importance and sensitivity of the Tibet
<br>issue, it would be virtually "impossible" for any leader to
<br>challenge Hu on Tibet. An issue as sensitive as Tibet policy
<br>would be controlled by a small group of top leaders, limited
<br>primarily to the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee
<br>(PBSC), meaning it is difficult to know precisely the content
<br>of leadership discussions on Tibet, longtime Embassy contact
<br>xxxxx.
<br>Nevertheless, "it is still quite clear," xxxxx argued, that Hu
<br>Jintao is "completely" in charge of the Tibet issue, and no
<br>other leader would "dare" confront Hu or the Party line over
<br>such a critical issue. Doing so would be "political suicide"
<br>and would make any leader vulnerable to charges of being
<br>"soft," or even being a "traitor," risking eventual removal,
<br>a la the ouster of former Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang
<br>in 1987, xxxxx averred.
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) There is "absolutely no division" within the
<br>leadership on Tibet, xxxxx. For the
<br>Chinese leadership, Tibet is even more sensitive than Taiwan.
<br>Among the nine members of the PBSC who are controlling
<br>China's Tibet policy, no one has the stature or experience to
<br>challenge Hu, xxxxx said, noting that four are brand new
<br>members of the PBSC, and no one on the PBSC other than Hu has
<br>direct experience in Tibet. It was Hu Jintao, as then-Party
<br>Secretary in Tibet, who oversaw the "quick and effective
<br>
<br>Sipdis
<br>suppression" of protests there in 1987 and 1989, which earned
<br>him "great praise" from then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping
<br>and which was an important factor in his elevation to the
<br>PBSC in 1992, xxxxx recalled. Thus, Hu has "great confidence"
<br>when it comes to Tibet, putting him in a virtually
<br>unassailable position. There may be room within the
<br>leadership for expressing differences with Hu on issues such
<br>as Taiwan, economic development or political reform, but not
<br>on Tibet, xxxxx asserted.
<br>
<br>Different Views Exist in Party, but No Disagreement at Top
<br>--------------------------------------------- -------------
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) A range of contacts have acknowledged that there are
<br>differences of opinion within the Party and among elites
<br>regarding Tibet, though none believed this reflected any
<br>disagreement among the top leadership. For example,xxxxx acknowledged the presence of
<br>more "moderate" voices on Tibet within the Party, but he
<br>nevertheless stressed that it is Hu Jintao who is
<br>"completely" in charge of China's Tibet policy. Moreover, it
<br>
<br>Beijing 00001454 002 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>is clear that those such as Hu favoring a "hard line" are
<br>calling the shots. (Note:xxxxx view
<br>that Tibet policy is more sensitive for China's leadership
<br>than even Taiwan, noting that despite its rhetoric, Beijing
<br>has de facto accepted the involvement of the United States in
<br>Taiwan, but China can never accept the "interference" of
<br>foreign powers in Tibet.)xxxxx,
<br>confessed that he "personally" favors a more "measured"
<br>approach to Tibet, to include dialogue with the Dalai Lama,
<br>given that "only the Dalai Lama" can unify the majority of
<br>the Tibetan community both within China and abroad.
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Separately, xxxxx "many elites" are advocating
<br>a reassessment of policy toward the Dalai Lama, questioning
<br>the wisdom of demonizing and refusing to negotiate with him.
<br>According to xxxxx however, apart from a "minority" of
<br>"elites" and "intellectuals," the majority of the Party
<br>rank-and-file, as well as "98 percent" of the public, support
<br>the current policy. Any serious disagreement over Tibet
<br>among the Party leadership is "simply unimaginable," xxxxx
<br>stated, a view separately shared xxxxx.
<br>
<br>Public Statements: Difference in Nuance, not Substance
<br>--------------------------------------------- ----------
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) While there may be differences in how various leaders
<br>have publicly articulated China's Tibet policy, there are no
<br>substantive differences among the top leadership, contacts
<br>asserted. For example, xxxxx said he
<br>does not believe there is disagreement between President Hu
<br>Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao over Tibet, as some have
<br>speculated based on Wen's purportedly more "moderate"
<br>comments to UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his statement
<br>to the media in Laos on March 30 regarding the Dalai Lama.
<br>xxxx asserted that, on Tibet, Hu and Wen are like a
<br>"restaurant sugar packet," black on one side and white on the
<br>other, but still part of the same whole. In other words, Hu
<br>and Wen merely emphasize different aspects of the same
<br>policy. xxxxx said xxxxx"sensed" Wen may be
<br>"slightly more moderate" on Tibet than some other leaders,
<br>but he thought that represents Wen's style and does not imply
<br>a disagreement over official policy. xxxxx shared this view,
<br>attributing the Prime Minister's March 30 remarks to "Wen
<br>simply being Wen" and appearing more "moderate and
<br>reasonable" on almost every issue, even though his comments
<br>represented no serious departure from the official line.
<br>
<br>Southern Media Pieces Reflect No Division over Policy
<br>--------------------------------------------- --------
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) xxxxx did not think that two
<br>recent articles in Party-controlled southern newspapers
<br>signaled leadership debate or divisions, instead offering
<br>that the articles perhaps reflected an adjustment in the
<br>Party's media strategy. Both articles appeared on April 3 in
<br>Guangdong Provincial Party papers that have a reputation for
<br>pushing the limits of Central Propaganda Department (CPD)
<br>guidelines. The first, which appeared in a blog run by
<br>Southern Metropolis (Nanfang Dushibao), was critical of the
<br>Party's restrictions on reporting in Tibet, arguing that
<br>allowing foreign reporters to cover the story directly would
<br>provide a more accurate picture of events. The second,
<br>published in Southern Weekend (Nanfang Zhoumou), argued that
<br>most Tibetans are not separatists and do not support or
<br>participate in the unrest or advocate violence, and that such
<br>distinctions should be made when responding to the issue.
<br>The article also called for talks with the Dalai Lama. (See
<br>refs A-C.)
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) xxxxx with whom
<br>PolOffs met in the last week had not read or heard of either
<br>article, which PolOffs interpreted as a sign that the pieces
<br>are not terribly significant. xxxxx, explicitly made
<br>this point, arguing that the article in the Southern
<br>Metropolis did not represent anything other than the
<br>"pro-Western slant" of the Southern Daily Media Group and
<br>"liberal southern journalists." The piece would only be
<br>significant if more "authoritative" media outlets had picked
<br>it up. xxxxx, thought it represented a desire among some
<br>elites for a review of Tibet policy but also noted that the
<br>piece was criticized by many internally in the Party. xxxxx, saying that
<br>the articles merely reflected the "traditionally liberal"
<br>stances of both newspapers, which are noted for "pushing the
<br>envelope" ("da cabianqiu," literally "playing edge ball").
<br>
<br>Beijing 00001454 003 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>It is too early to tell whether these pieces have crossed a
<br>red line, xxxxx said, noting that both papers have often
<br>gotten into trouble with propaganda officials in the past.
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Surprisingly, even the xxxxx had
<br>not read either article that appeared in his group's
<br>newspapers. In response to PolOff's summary of the pieces,
<br>he strongly doubted they carried any political significance.
<br>Perhaps, he said, they represent an adjustment in the Party's
<br>media strategy. The Southern Weekend editor-in-chief must
<br>have had prior approval from Party authorities to publish the
<br>piece, xxxxx surmised, otherwise the editor would have been
<br>"dismissed immediately" for publishing such a sensitive
<br>article on his own. With Hu Jintao himself in charge of the
<br>media response to Tibet, xxxxx asked rhetorically, what
<br>newspaper editor would dare challenge the official media
<br>line, even implicitly? Therefore, the article's import, xxxxx
<br>claimed, is that it demonstrates the "slight loosening" of
<br>Party propaganda guidance on Tibet coverage beginning in late
<br>March, which purportedly allows for the "more nuanced"
<br>reporting advocated in the Southern Weekend article itself.
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) Similarly, xxxxx was not aware of the articles. After
<br>listening to PolOff's explanation of them, however, xxxxx
<br>commented that the pieces likely represent the fact that
<br>there is "room for diversity" under the Propaganda
<br>Department's latest guidance. (Note: Despite this supposed
<br>"room" for more nuanced reporting on Tibet, xxxxx
<br>said Tibet is "far too sensitive" and his magazine has
<br>therefore decided "not to touch" the story for now.xxxxx,
<br>reportedly have been "ordered" to produce cover stories on
<br>Tibet under "very strict" guidelines from the Propaganda
<br>Department.)
<br>
<br>Party Buoyed by Nationalist Sentiment...
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Almost all of xxxxx the Party has been
<br>buoyed by rising nationalist sentiment, fueled in part by
<br>anger at the West over "biased" media reporting on Tibet and
<br>Olympic-related protests.xxxxx all emphasized to
<br>PolOff that Chinese "anger" over the West's "bias" on Tibet
<br>is real, widespread and will have long-term effects. xxxxx
<br>them seemed themselves to be angry over Western
<br>media reporting, refusing to recognize the irony that for
<br>most Chinese, their only access to this "biased Western
<br>reporting" is through the official PRC press agency Xinhua's
<br>characterization of it. xxxxx emphasized that virtually
<br>"everyone" he knows is angry and believes that Western
<br>reporting, together with calls for boycotting the Olympic
<br>opening ceremony, implies support for Tibetan independence
<br>and makes the public feel that the West is trying to "keep
<br>China down." xxxxx, meanwhile, said
<br>nationalism is definitely surging, but he thought this
<br>sentiment is largely concentrated in the 25-35-year-old age
<br>group among both Hans and Tibetans.
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Whatever the causes of the surge in nationalism, the
<br>result has been a dramatic increase in support for the
<br>Party's policy on Tibet, contacts say. xxxxx said this outcome is partly a "natural"
<br>reaction to the fact that Chinese have in recent years become
<br>more nationalistic as a result of growing pride over China's
<br>rapid development, with the Tibet furor merely providing the
<br>most recent "spark" to inflame passions. xxxx separately acknowledged, however, that the Party's
<br>propaganda line has also purposefully stoked nationalistic
<br>feelings in order to rally the public in support of the
<br>Center's Tibet policy, and so far, it has been very
<br>successful in doing so. The recent Tibet crisis has
<br>"completely unified" the people behind the Party and
<br>Government, something that had been "unthinkable" throughout
<br>most of the 1980s and 1990s,xxxxx asserted.
<br>
<br>...But Also Constrained by Popular Passions
<br>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Although support for the Party over Tibet is
<br>currently quite high, popular passions also serve to
<br>constrain the leadership's options, xxxxx
<br>warned. Nationalism remains one "pillar" of Party rule, but
<br>central leaders do not want to let these feelings "spin out
<br>of control," xxxxx said. Perhaps reflecting these concerns,
<br>the Propaganda Department earlier this month reportedly
<br>directed that attacks on the Western press in China's
<br>official media be curtailed, according xxxxx
<br>
<br>Beijing 00001454 004 of 004
<br>
<br>
<br>xxxxx. That has not, however, stopped Chinese bloggers
<br>from continuing their attacks via the Internet, xxxxx
<br>observed.xxxxx also expressed concern about the
<br>long-term implications of the surge in nationalism, noting
<br>that "nothing is ever completely good." At any rate, there
<br>is "virtually no way" the Center could initiate a change in
<br>policy toward Tibet and the Dalai Lama, at least in the short
<br>term, given the popular anger over such issues, xxxxx said.
<br>
<br>Policy Change Unlikely in the Short Term
<br>----------------------------------------
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) Major policy adjustment on Tibet is highly unlikely
<br>for the foreseeable future for a host of reasons other than
<br>popular sentiment, at least until after the Olympics,
<br>contacts say. Given Hu's own legacy in Tibet, where he
<br>cracked down on similar demonstrations in 1987 and 1989, Hu
<br>Jintao will likely be loath to adopt a "softer" line, lest
<br>his own policies and past actions come under criticism,
<br>xxxxx argued. Moreover, it will be
<br>almost "impossible" for Chinese leaders to reorient policy if
<br>they look like they are doing so under international
<br>pressure, xxxxx assessed. Moreover,
<br>xxxxx observed, domestic stability remains the
<br>leadership's top priority above all else, meaning there will
<br>"almost surely" be no relaxation of the current hard line on
<br>Tibet or in places like Xinjiang. xxxxx said he sensed
<br>Chinese leaders worry they could lose control of Tibet if
<br>they do not maintain tight control there, which would have
<br>both domestic consequences and could invite "unwanted
<br>interference" from India.
<br>
<br>¶15. (C) While staging a successful Olympics is also a
<br>priority, xxxxx said he senses the leadership has
<br>assessed that at a minimum, athletes will show up to the
<br>Games. As a result, the Center is starting to adjust public
<br>expectations about the Games by saying that, even if there is
<br>a "boycott" of the opening ceremony, that is not important,
<br>given that it is the IOC and respective National Olympic
<br>Committees, not the Chinese Government, hat decide whether
<br>to invite national leaders. (Note: xxxxx disagreed,
<br>saying that, in his view, the success of the Games for
<br>Chinese leaders hinges on whether President Bush attends the
<br>opening ceremonies.) xxxxx said
<br>that Hu Jintao's comments on April 12 to Australian PM Rudd
<br>on the margins of the Bo'ao Forum, which were reported via
<br>Xinhua and reflected China's hard-line stance on Tibet to
<br>date, signaled that domestically there is "no room for
<br>debate" on the Tibet issue. Only after Tibetan areas have
<br>"settled down" and the Olympics have concluded, will there be
<br>any chance for a possible review of Tibet policy, he asserted.
