<br>¶B. HANKINS JUNE 18 E-MAIL 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Counselor Andrew Young, 1.4 (b/d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: Presidential AF-advisor Romain Serman 
<br>on June 18 said that deposed Mauritanian President Abdallahi 
<br>seemed to be blocking final political agreement over the 
<br>Dakar accord. France was prepared to call a "stop" to the 
<br>process and urge that the Dakar accord be implemented as is, 
<br>with or without Abdallahi's agreement or participation, which 
<br>could encourage cooperation on Abdallahi's part. Serman said 
<br>that junta leader Aziz visited Paris "privately" on June 12 
<br>and met with Presidential Secretary-General Claude Gueant, 
<br>with discussion focusing on terrorism. Serman said that 
<br>President Sarkozy planned soon on chairing a high-level GOF 
<br>meeting on terrorism in the Sahel, which indicated the level 
<br>of French concern about terrorism in the region. Serman 
<br>criticized businessman/lobbyist Robert Bourgi for his role in 
<br>arranging Aziz's meeting with Gueant and for several press 
<br>leaks involving Aziz and the late President Bongo of Gabon. 
<br>Serman said that Bourgi should not be viewed in any manner as 
<br>a representative or spokesman for the GOF, including with 
<br>respect to his most recent activities in Madagascar to 
<br>promote himself and his business interests. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>MAURITANIA 
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>AZIZ'S VISIT TO PARIS 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Serman confirmed press reports that junta leader 
<br>Aziz traveled to Paris and met with Presidential 
<br>Secretary-General Claude Gueant on June 12. Serman said the 
<br>visit was engineered by businessman and self-styled AF 
<br>lobbyist Robert Bourgi, who had ties to Gueant and to 
<br>President Sarkozy pre-dating Sarkozy's election to the 
<br>presidency (see below for further on Bourgi). Bourgi 
<br>encouraged Aziz to make a "private" visit, flew Aziz to 
<br>France on one of his own planes, and arranged the meeting 
<br>with Gueant. Serman, who did not attend the Aziz-Gueant 
<br>meeting, understood that it consisted largely of a discussion 
<br>of the growing terrorism problem in the Sahel, a subject of 
<br>keen interest to Gueant. Serman said that they "undoubtedly"

<br>
<br>¶6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>
<br>(C/NF) ROBERT BOURGI 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C/NF) Serman's mention of Bourgi allowed us to ask 
<br>about his role and influence, a subject of episodic reporting 
<br>in the press, where Bourgi is depicted as one of the last 
<br>"France-Afrique" fixers, middlemen, operators, and 
<br>businessmen. Serman said that Bourgi had longstanding ties 
<br>to Gueant and Sarkozy but that he was first and foremost a 
<br>self-promoting businessman looking out for his own interests. 
<br>A true wheeler-dealer, Bourgi's main "client" had been 
<br>Gabon's recently-deceased President Bongo. Bourgi also had 
<br>ties to ROC's Sassou Nguesso and to Senegal's Wade, although 
<br>these were less significant than his ties to Bongo. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C/NF) Serman said that Bourgi was rapidly burning his 
<br>bridges, however, and this was causing his influence to drop 
<br>precipitously among the French and Africans as well. Bourgi 
<br>was the source of the press leak announcing Bongo's death 
<br>before the Gabonese were prepared to make the announcement 
<br>themselves. This leak angered Bongo's family. Serman 
<br>reported that Sarkozy was also unhappy about the leak, 
<br>especially since the information was attributed in the press 
<br>to "a source close to the French government," which tended to 
<br>make observers think that the GOF was responsible for the 
<br>leak or tacitly approved of it, which was not the case. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C/NF) The French were also annoyed that Bourgi leaked 
<br>the fact of Aziz's meeting with Gueant to the press. Aziz's 
<br>visit to France was supposed to be private, as was his 
<br>meeting with Gueant. In Serman's view, Bourgi leaked news of 
<br>the event in an effort to demonstrate his continuing clout 
<br>after the Bongo episode. Serman said this was backfiring, 
<br>however, as the French, including especially Sarkozy and 
<br>Gueant, were not at all pleased with the leak. Serman said 
<br>that Bourgi "is no fool, but sometimes it seems he can't help 
<br>himself when there's an opportunity for self-promotion, even 
<br>if he knows it might cost him." 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C/NF) Although Madagascar was not his area of 
<br>expertise, Serman was aware of Bourgi's attempts to play a 
<br>"fixer" role there amidst the current political turmoil, 
<br>"which gives him an opportunity to place himself in the thick 
<br>of things.". Serman said that Bourgi was eager to score new 
<br>business in response to the potential loss of the Gabon 
<br>account and his alienation of the Bongo clan. Serman said 
<br>that Bourgi also had new rivals for influence, with the 
<br>opening up of the old "France-Afrique" network that Sarkozy 
<br>has encouraged since taking office; this too was causing 
<br>Bourgi to scramble for new business. Speaking with emphasis, 
<br>Serman said that "you should be aware that in Madagascar and 
<br>everywhere else he is active, Bourgi does not represent the 
<br>French government and does not speak for us. And you should 
<br>tell everybody else that too." 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C/NF) Serman concluded by noting that Bourgi often 
<br>used "La Lettre du Continent," the bi-weekly, Paris-based 
<br>newsletter covering principally francophone Africa, as the 
<br>vehicle for his news leaks. Serman advised that anything 
<br>appearing in "La Lettre" smacking of a possible Bourgi 
<br>connection should be read with caution, and that one should 
<br>keep in mind that Bourgi's primary objective was 
<br>self-promotion for the purpose of self-enrichment.
