<br>
<br>Classified By: CDA DAVID RUNDELL, 1.4 (b),(d) 
<br>
<br>¶1. Key points: 
<br>
<br>-- (SBU) Special Advisor Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and 
<br>Treasury DAS Glaser were briefed on Saudi terror finance 
<br>efforts at a May 16 meeting with Interior Ministry (MOI) 
<br>officials at the Security Forces Officers Club in Riyadh. 
<br>Holbrooke also received a briefing on Saudi counterterrorism 
<br>strategies (reftel). 
<br>-- (SBU) Saudi Arabia will join the Egmont Group by the end 
<br>of May 2009. 
<br>-- (C) Holbrooke pushed for stronger cooperation in pursuing 
<br>sources of funding for the Taliban, particularly in the Gulf 
<br>States. 
<br>-- (C) The Hajj is still a major security loophole for the 
<br>Saudis, since pilgrims often travel with large amounts of 
<br>cash and the Saudis cannot refuse them entry into Saudi 
<br>Arabia. A new Saudi law requires arriving travelers to 
<br>declare cash over certain amounts. 
<br>-- (C) The MOI is concerned about funds flowing to Hizballah 
<br>from the Saudi Shi'a community. 
<br>-- (C) The political situation in Pakistan affects MOI's 
<br>intelligence cooperation with Pakistan's ISI. 
<br>
<br>
<br>New saudi fiu promises better cooperation 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) The briefing was delivered by officials from the 
<br>MOI's new Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). They said the 
<br>Saudi FIU's mission is to cooperate with all other 
<br>authorities to combat money laundering and terrorism finance, 
<br>and outlined the divisions of FIU and their responsibilities 
<br>to receive, analyze, investigate, and act upon reports of 
<br>terrorist finance activities in concert with other Saudi 
<br>financial and law enforcement agencies. The FIU had a budget 
<br>of $31 million in 2008. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Holbrooke asked how the U.S. was working with the new 
<br>FIU. DAS Glaser said FIU cooperation will enable Saudi 
<br>Arabia to plug into the global terror finance context. The 
<br>U.S. has tested the Saudi system with three requests and has 
<br>received a good response. Glaser added that Saudi success in 
<br>rolling up domestic terror cells has had a positive impact 
<br>but the need now was to target financial donors and networks 
<br>that channel the funds to AQ and the Taliban. The daily work 
<br>of exchanging information with Saudi Arabia was going well. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Holbrooke asked whether the relationship could be 
<br>further improved. The Saudis replied that Saudi Arabia would 
<br>join the Egmont Group by the end of May 2009. Holbrooke said 
<br>terrorists exploit the seams between countries such as 
<br>borders, free trade zones, and international networks such as 
<br>Hawala systems, and that in this respect drug proceeds were 
<br>not the primary source of funds for the Taliban; rather 
<br>private donations from the Gulf were the chief source of 
<br>Taliban financing. This indicated the need for a new level 
<br>of cooperation, he said, to address funds flowing from the 
<br>Gulf to the Taliban, AQ, and South Asian terrorist groups. 
<br>In particular, the UAE, Pakistan, and the UK must be on board. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) MOI counterterrorism advisor xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>said Saudi Arabia was working to create a 
<br>"coherent plan" on terrorist finance that included 
<br>establishing a legal basis for taking action against 
<br>financiers. The MOI had no problem targeting organizations, 
<br>he said, but preferred to go after financiers on an 
<br>individual basis: "the bad apples, not the whole barrel," he 
<br>said. With the FIU in place, he said, the MOI would be 
<br>better able to "turn leads into tangible evidence" and follow 
<br>up with counterpart authorities in other countries. "We used 
<br>to call Dubai the 'Black Hole'," of terrorist finance, he 
<br>said. Glaser agreed with the need for a comprehensive 
<br>strategy. He said he understood the Saudi approach to focus 
<br>on individuals rather than organizations, but there was 
<br>another more common model that focused on organizations as 
<br>part of a broader terrorist network. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Hajj, hizballah, and pakistan 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) MOI Senior Advisor xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>said the Saudi approach was based on the fact that Saudi 
<br>Arabia had been in a war and had to act. Saudi authorities 
<br>had detained over 4,000 individuals, some of whom were 
<br>suspected of terrorist financing offenses and would act if 
<br>supplied with information. Hajj was still a big problem for 
<br>the Saudis, since they could not refuse to let pilgrims enter 
<br>the country. Some of the non-Saudi terrorism detainees in 
<br>Saudi Arabia had entered as pilgrims. The Saudi government 
<br>recently passed a law requiring arriving travelers to declare 
<br>cash above a certain amount, but Hajj was still "a vacuum in 
<br>our security," he admitted. Another problem was money going 
<br>to Hizballah from Saudi Shiites. The Saudis' focus had been 
<br>on funds from Sunni sources, but they needed to focus on the 
<br>Shi'a too,xxxxxxxxxxxx said. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Holbrooke noted that Pakistan was also a center for 
<br>terrorist financing through Islamic charities and asked 
<br>whether the Saudis were monitoring the large Pakistani 
<br>community in Saudi Arabia, and whether the Saudis were 
<br>consulting with the governments of Pakistan, India, and 
<br>Bangladesh about the issue. xxxxxxxxxxxx said the Saudis had 
<br>detained numerous individuals from these countries and were 
<br>seeking cooperation to investigate their activities. He 
<br>added that "we talk to ISI (Pakistan's intelligence agency) 
<br>and get a good response, but we think ten times before 
<br>approaching them; things are changing there and we are 
<br>advised to be careful." Political unrest and new ISI 
<br>leadership were the principal changes, he said. As a result, 
<br>he concluded, "We only trust face-to-face transmission of 
<br>information." The MOI had shared information with ISI on 
<br>Pakistanis in Saudi Arabia suspected of terror finance, but 
<br>ISI had not responded. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Don't forget iran 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Holbrooke asked whether the Taliban still found 
<br>support in Saudi Arabia. xxxxxxxxxxxx answered that support 
<br>from Saudi Arabia was less than it had been in earlier years, 
<br>such as the 1980s, but was still present. Holbrooke asked 
<br>about Iran, and xxxxxxxxxxxx replied that in the Saudi view, 
<br>Iran was a "serious contributor" to terrorism activities in 
<br>many places, including Yemen, North Africa, and Latin 
<br>America. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Holbrooke concluded by assuring his hosts of the U.S. 
<br>commitment to cooperation on fighting terrorism and for 
<br>better relations with the Muslim world.
