<br>SUBJECT: FRANCE-IRAN: JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AT THE ROOT OF 
<br>BAIL SET FOR KAKAVAND, PER PRESIDENCY ADVISOR 
<br>
<br>REF: A. A. PARIS 01205 
<br>¶B. B. BAGHDAD 02397 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Kathleen H. Allegrone 
<br>for Reasons 1.4 (b), (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) We met with Elysee strategic affairs advisor Richier 
<br>September 4 to follow up on reports that a French judge had 
<br>released Iranian national Majid Kakavand on bail and subject 
<br>to determination of a pending U.S. extradition request. In 
<br>previous conversations about the fate of French citizen 
<br>Clothilde Reiss and her release to French embassy custody in 
<br>Tehran, Richier had assured us that France had no intention 
<br>to negotiate with Iranian authorities on a prisoner exchange 
<br>and that President Sarkozy himself had been apprised of and 
<br>rejected an Iranian effort to seek the release of Kakavand. 
<br>(ref. a) 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) Responding to Pol M/C,s questions, Richier told us 
<br>that the Elysee had been taken completely by surprise by the 
<br>judge's decision. The prosecutor in the case had 
<br>consistently argued for holding Kakavand, but the judge had 
<br>determined that Kakavand "presented little chance for flight" 
<br>and had agreed to release him on 200,000 euro bond. 
<br>According to Richier, the Elysee reacted quickly and strongly 
<br>to news of the decision on August 28 and that there were very 
<br>sharp exchanges between the Office of the President (Elysee) 
<br>and the Justice Minister, but that the government cannot 
<br>reverse the judge,s decision. However, Richier assured us 
<br>that French authorities are keeping a close eye on 
<br>Kakavand,s whereabouts to prevent or interrupt possible 
<br>flight. They have established what Richier called "tight" 
<br>surveillance on Kakavand. Proving the point, Richier 
<br>telephoned to a colleague in one of the services who 
<br>confirmed that Kakavand was currently in buildings owned by 
<br>Iran and managed by the Iranian Embassy, located in Paris. 
<br>Richier added his own private observation that the way in 
<br>which the judgment was rendered in this case implies that the 
<br>request for extradition will be approved, although we must 
<br>wait until October for that decision. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Comment: The French have been concerned, from the 
<br>beginning of their hostage case, about possible Iranian 
<br>pressure to exchange Iranian prisoners for French or U.S. 
<br>nationals held in Iran. Embassy Baghdad reporting (ref. b) 
<br>suggests that is exactly what Iran plans to do. Obviously 
<br>the French judge,s decision to grant Kakavand a temporary 
<br>release complicates the situation. However, Sarkozy,s 
<br>public tone and Richier,s strong comments, suggest that 
<br>France will make every effort to keep Kakavand under close 
<br>surveillance, pending a decision on the extradition request.
