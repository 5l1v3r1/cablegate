<br>REF: NICODEMUS/PALMER/D'ELIA/KAMINSKI/KANEDA E-MAILS 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Josiah Rosenblatt, 1.4 (b/d 
<br>). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NOFORN) SUMMARY: XXXXXXXXXXXXl told us January 12 
<br>that Judge Bruguiere's November 17 report recommending the 
<br>prosecution of President Kagame and requesting the arrest of 
<br>nine of his associates had been forwarded to Interpol. He 
<br>noted that it was incumbent on the U.S. to make its own 
<br>determination as to whether the U.S. was subject to any legal 
<br>obligations as a result. Belgium and the UK have informed 
<br>France that they will honor the arrest warrants if any of the 
<br>nine arrive in their territories and will do so pursuant to 
<br>an EU agreement covering such matters. The same official 
<br>said that former-President Habyarimana's widow, who had 
<br>recently lost a French court case on her request for 
<br>political asylum, planned to appeal. The case was thus not 
<br>yet closed, and Rwanda had not, contrary to media reports, 
<br>"officially" requested her arrest in connection with the 1994 
<br>genocide. Separately, XXXXXXXXXXXX conceded that the GOF had given Bruguiere the green  light to issue his report, in response to Rwanda's continuing  probes into, and allegations concerning, France's role in the  events of 1994 in Rwanda; the same source surmised that the  GOF had miscalculated and had not envisioned the severe  measures Rwanda would take in response
<br> END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>ARREST WARRANTS 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) MFA Rwanda desk officer Laurent Chevallier said on 
<br>January 12 that Judge Bruguiere's November 17 report on 
<br>events in 1994 concerning the death of then-Rwandan President 
<br>Habyarimana and recommending the prosecution of President 
<br>Kagame and calling for the arrest of nine of his associates, 
<br>had been forwarded to Interpol. (We contacted Chevallier in 
<br>response to ref A e-mails asking whether Bruguiere's report 
<br>created any legal obligations for the U.S. should the 
<br>individuals named seek to enter the U.S.) Chevallier said 
<br>that he was not in a position to make determinations on U.S. 
<br>legal obligations. The matter had been forwarded to 
<br>Interpol, he repeated, but he was not certain how Interpol 
<br>had proceeded. Chevallier was confident, however, that 
<br>Bruguiere's report had the same effect as the issuance of 
<br>international arrest warrants. He said that Belgium and the 
<br>UK had already told the French that they would arrest those 
<br>named should they enter their territories, based on 
<br>Bruguiere's warrants. However, they would act not because of 
<br>obligations regarding Interpol but rather in accordance with 
<br>an EU agreement covering arrest warrants issued by member 
<br>states. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Chevallier advised that the USG was the only entity 
<br>that could determine whether the circumstances of this case 
<br>and its relationship with Interpol placed any obligation on 
<br>the U.S. concerning these individuals. "I'm sure you 
<br>understand that as a French official, I really can't tell 
<br>your government how this all affects you," he continued. He 
<br>suggested that officials in Washington study the matter and, 
<br>if necessary, work with Interpol to determine what, if any, 
<br>obligations Washington might incur. 
<br>
<br>MRS. HABYARIMANA 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Chevallier commented briefly on the case of the 
<br>widow of former Rwandan President Habyarimana. The press 
<br>announced during the week of January 8 that a French court 
<br>had refused her request to remain in France as a political 
<br>exile, and also reported that Rwanda had insisted that she be 
<br>arrested for her alleged role in the 1994 genocide. 
<br>Chevallier referred to the January 11 MFA press briefing, 
<br>during which the spokesperson noted developments in her case 
<br>and denied that Rwanda had "officially" requested her arrest. 
<br>Chevallier said that Mrs. Habyarimana's case was not closed, 
<br>and that in fact she had already indicated an intention to 
<br>appeal "before the end of January." Chevallier reiterated 
<br>that, to his knowledge, Rwanda had not "officially" requested 
<br>her arrest. He remarked dryly that it would be interesting 
<br>if Rwanda did so, since it had "officially" severed 
<br>diplomatic relations with France in response to the Bruguiere 
<br>report. 
<br>
<br>(C/NOFORN) GOF GAVE GREEN LIGHT TO BRUGUIERE, ACCORDING TO 
<br>MFA DAS 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C/NOFORN) In a recent conversation largely on other 
<br>matters, XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>confided that the GOF had given Bruguiere the green 
<br>light to issue his report. (NOTE: The party and public line 
<br>
<br>PARIS 00000186 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>has been that Bruguiere, exercising his judicial 
<br>independence, had done so without consulting other GOF 
<br>elements. END NOTE.)XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>said that France had wanted to reciprocate for 
<br>Rwanda's taking steps to investigate France's 
<br>alleged involvement in the 1994 genocide and its aftermath. 
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>said that the GOF had miscalculated, not foreseeing 
<br>the strong measures (i.e., severing diplomatic relations) 
<br>Rwanda would take in retaliation. (NOTE: XXXXXXXXXXXX
