<br>SUBJECT: SENIOR MFA OFFICIAL ON MOTTAKI VISIT AND IRAQ-IRAN 
<br>BORDER DISPUTE 
<br>
<br>REF: A. BAGHDAD 3326 
<br>¶B. 09 BAGHDAD 2237 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Acting Political M/C Yuri Kim for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d ) 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Ambassador Taha Shukr Abbassi, the head of 
<br>the Iraqi MFA's Neighboring Countries' division (A/S 
<br>equivalent), made the following comments regarding Iranian FM 
<br>Mottaki's visit and the recent oil field dispute between Iraq 
<br>and Iran: (1) Mottaki promised to fully withdraw Iranian 
<br>soldiers from the disputed oil field (ref A) and pressed the 
<br>GOI to conduct joint surveys of the Iran-Iraq border; (2) the 
<br>Iranians have not yet withdrawn their soldiers; (3) GOI 
<br>technical survey teams will begin their work once Iranian 
<br>soldiers fully withdraw; (3) the incident has tarnished 
<br>Iran's standing among many Iraqi Shi'a supporters; (4) the 
<br>GOI does not recognize the 1975 Algiers Accord governing 
<br>border issues and would like to negotiate a new or amended 
<br>agreement with Iran; (5) Iran, unlike Turkey, is slow in 
<br>fulfilling its promises and implementing bilateral 
<br>agreements; and (6) Iraq recognizes the need to proceed 
<br>patiently and diplomatically in its dealing with Iran to 
<br>ensure a peaceful outcome to these and other disputes. END 
<br>SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>Iranian Troops Still Present 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) On January 13, Ambassador Taha Shukr Abbassi met with 
<br>Post's Deputy Political Counselor and Senior Iran Watcher to 
<br>discuss FM Mottaki's recent visit in light of the Fakka oil 
<br>field incident. Abbassi, a career diplomat who has had 
<br>extensive dealings with the Iranians, confirmed that FM 
<br>Mottaki pressed the GOI during his visit to resume the work 
<br>of a technical committee tasked with conducting joint surveys 
<br>along the Iran-Iraq border, including the maritime border. 
<br>FM Mottaki offered assurances of Iranian troop withdrawal 
<br>from the disputed oil field; however, the continued presence 
<br>of Iranian troops called into question Iran's willingness to 
<br>deliver on its promises, Abbassi complained. He added that 
<br>the Iranian incursion has undermined Iran's standing among 
<br>many Iraqi Shi'a supporters, who viewed the dispute as 
<br>nothing more than typical Iranian aggression and interference 
<br>in Iraqi affairs. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Abbassi criticized Mottaki for failing to keep his 
<br>promise and said the work of the two GOI technical teams 
<br>(land and water) would only begin once all Iranian troops 
<br>have fully withdrawn from the disputed area. Abbassi 
<br>asserted that the work of the committees "will take years to 
<br>complete" given the complexity of the terrain and the 
<br>security risks posed by landmines that are scattered along 
<br>the border areas since the Iran-Iraq war. Senior MFA 
<br>Advisor Mohammed al-Haj Hamoud told DCM the same day that the 
<br>Iraqis had been ready to allow the working groups to start 
<br>their work, even with the less-than-complete Iranian border, 
<br>"We're only talking about a 100 meters or so and the border 
<br>area is admittedly undefined," but then the Iranians moved in 
<br>high-powered lights and a small piece of artillery. 
<br>Following that, FM Zebari had ordered the teams to stand down 
<br>at present, said Haj Hamoud, adding that an additional 
<br>"partial withdrawal, a gesture" might be enough to get the 
<br>work back on track. (NOTE: USG satellite imagery confirms 
<br>the continued presence of Iranian troops approximately 75-100 
<br>meters inside Iraq. Imagery has also captured what appears 
<br>to be Iranian construction activity, including the 
<br>Qto be Iranian construction activity, including the 
<br>establishment of a small building near the troop outpost. 
<br>END NOTE) 
<br>
<br>Iran Not As Reliable As Turkey 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Describing Iran's intransigence as usual Iranian 
<br>stubbornness and inefficiency when it comes to implementing 
<br>agreements, Abbassi said that over a year ago, he personally 
<br>presented Mottaki with a non-paper proposing a new way 
<br>forward on Iraq-Iran relations, focusing largely on bilateral 
<br>issues such as borders, maritime rights, natural resources, 
<br>etc. The paper was intended to wipe the slate clean for both 
<br>countries, who technically remain in a state of war following 
<br>the cessation of hostilities in 1988. "We have not heard back 
<br>regarding the paper," Abbassi lamented. "The Iranians still 
<br>feel that they are dealing with the same Iraq that Saddam 
<br>dominated for so long. But we are a very different country 
<br>now," Abbassi said in trying to explain lingering Iranian 
<br>suspicions about GOI intentions. In comparison, Abbassi 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00000112 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>applauded the efficiency of the Turkish government in its 
<br>dealings with Iraq, stating that "Turkey is very good at 
<br>following-up and keeping promises." 
<br>
<br>Algiers Accord Obsolete 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Abbassi commented that the GOI does not accept or 
<br>formally recognize the 1975 Algiers Accord that was signed 
<br>between then-Vice President Saddam Hussein and the Shah of 
<br>Iran. Abbassi noted that Saddam himself literally tore up 
<br>the agreement during the war with Iran and that no current or 
<br>future Iraqi parliament would ratify the agreement in its 
<br>present form. (NOTE: The agreement was ratified under Iraqi 
<br>President al-Bakr's government and subsequently registered 
<br>with the UN. END NOTE.) According to Abbassi, the GOI would 
<br>welcome a new or amended agreement that takes into account 
<br>existing political and geographic realities, notably with the 
<br>Shatt-al-Arab waterway since 1975. However, the Iranians are 
<br>reluctant to renegotiate because they fear losing territory 
<br>and waters claimed in the Shatt al-Arab, which a new 
<br>demarcation would likely not recognize, Abbassi said. (NOTE: 
<br>Despite repeated condemnation of the Algiers Accord by 
<br>numerous GOI officials, the GOI has never made use of any of 
<br>the dispute resolution mechanisms contained in the agreement, 
<br>nor made any attempt to legally terminate the agreement. END 
<br>NOTE.) 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Abbassi asked about what military support, if any, 
<br>the USG would be obliged or willing to provide to Iraq under 
<br>the Security Agreement in the event of future aggression by 
<br>any of its neighbors. He also encouraged greater USG public 
<br>statements condemning Iranian aggression as a violation of 
<br>international law in order to demonstrate to the Iraqi public 
<br>the USG's moral support for Iraq's territorial integrity. 
<br>Abbassi underscored that Iraq's relations with Iran will 
<br>require patience and diplomacy given historic grievances and 
<br>lingering suspicions. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Water and border disputes will continue to define 
<br>Iran and Iraq's broader bilateral agenda as Iraq regains its 
<br>political footing and maturity. Iran's reluctance (and 
<br>discomfort) in dealing with Iraq as an equal partner on 
<br>sensitive issues of broader public concern (water rights, 
<br>borders, trade) are likely to further erode GOI and Iraqi 
<br>public confidence in their closest neighbor's intentions and 
<br>"goodwill". Abbassi's comments highlight the challenges he 
<br>and other technocrats face in their dealings with Iran. It 
<br>is also increasingly apparent that both sides realize that 
<br>their bilateral dealings are driven less by a shared Shi'a 
<br>heritage and more by real-world priorities and diverging 
<br>interests.<br>
