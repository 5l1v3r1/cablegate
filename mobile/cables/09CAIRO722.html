<br>
<br>REF: A. CAIRO 705 
<br>¶B. CAIRO 618 
<br>¶C. CAIRO 451 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey for reason 1.4 (b). 
<br>
<br>¶1. KEY POINTS: 
<br>
<br>-- (S) President Mubarak sees Iran's attempts to exert 
<br>influence throughout the region as Egypt's primary strategic 
<br>threat. However, Mubarak's focus on the Iranian threat 
<br>differs somewhat from ours. While he will readily admit that 
<br>the Iranian nuclear program is a strategic and existential 
<br>threat to Egypt and the region, he sees that threat as 
<br>relatively "long term." What has seized his immediate 
<br>attention are Iran's non-nuclear destabilizing actions such 
<br>as support for HAMAS, media attacks, weapons and illicit 
<br>funds smuggling, all of which add up in his mind to "Iranian 
<br>influence spreading like a cancer from the GCC to Morocco." 
<br>
<br>-- (S) In particular, Egypt views Iran as an adversary that 
<br>is trying to undermine GOE efforts on Palestinian 
<br>reconciliation and preventing weapons smuggling to Gaza, 
<br>while endangering key GOE interests such as stability in 
<br>Lebanon and Sudan. 
<br>
<br>-- (S/NF) The GOE remains concerned with Iranian efforts to 
<br>interfere in Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq and Sudan, and Egypt views 
<br>the recently dismantled Sinai Hizballah cell as an 
<br>unacceptable Iranian escalation. 
<br>
<br>-- (S) The MFA believes that a harder U.S. line in UN fora on 
<br>Israel's nuclear program would strengthen the U.S. position 
<br>on demanding Iran cease working to develop nuclear weapons. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) Ambassador Ross, welcome to Egypt. Your visit comes 
<br>as Egypt continues its efforts to mediate a permanent 
<br>cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, to facilitate 
<br>intra-Palestinian negotiations and to stop the smuggling of 
<br>arms into Gaza. The GOE realizes that Iran is working to 
<br>undermine all of these Egyptian efforts. Many Egyptians see 
<br>the new U.S. Administration as a cause for optimism in both 
<br>the bilateral relationship and in U.S. engagement with the 
<br>region. President Mubarak appears ready to accept President 
<br>Obama's invitation to visit Washington within the next 
<br>several months, which will mark his first visit to Washington 
<br>since April 2004. Special Envoy for the Middle East Senator 
<br>George Mitchell has visited Egypt and the region three times. 
<br>While President Mubarak unfortunately will not be available, 
<br>we have requested meetings for you with Foreign Minister 
<br>Aboul Gheit, Intelligence Chief Omar Soliman, Arab League 
<br>Secretary-General Amre Moussa, National Democratic Party 
<br>Assistant Secretary-General Gamal Mubarak and Interior 
<br>Minister Habib Al-Adly. 
<br>
<br>----------------- 
<br>President Mubarak 
<br>----------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) President Mubarak has made it clear that he sees 
<br>Iran as Egypt's -- and the region's -- primary strategic 
<br>threat. His already dangerous neighborhood, he has stressed, 
<br>has only become more so since the fall of Saddam, who, as 
<br>nasty as he was, nevertheless stood as a wall against Iran, 
<br>according to Mubarak. He now sees Tehran's hand moving with 
<br>ease throughout the region, "from the Gulf to Morocco," as he 
<br>told a recent congressional delegation. The immediate threat 
<br>to Egypt comes from Iranian conspiracies with Hamas (which he 
<br>sees as the "offspring" of his own most dangerous internal 
<br>political threat, the Muslim Brotherhood) to stir up unrest 
<br>in Gaza, but he is also concerned about Iranian machinations 
<br>in Sudan and their efforts to create havoc elsewhere in the 
<br>region, including in Lebanon via Hezbollah. While Tehran's 
<br>nuclear threat is also a cause for concern, Mubarak is more 
<br>urgently seized with what he sees as the rise of pan-Shi'ism 
<br>and Iranian attempts to dominate the Middle East. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) The Egyptians have been clear they do not intend to 
<br>resume normal diplomatic ties with the Iranians until 
<br>specific political and security issues are addressed, 
<br>including the renaming of "Islambouli Street" named after 
<br>Sadat's assassin. The GOE recognizes that Iran's long arm 
<br>has extended into Gaza via Hamas, but the same time, they are 
<br>worried that we are going to strike a "grand deal" with the 
<br>Iranians. Accordingly, the Egyptian MFA has reported to us 
<br>that they are in touch with the Iranians and "listen" to them 
<br>on regional issues. The prevailing GOE view remains a 
<br>principled rejection of any diplomatic rapprochement, but we 
<br>
<br>CAIRO 00000722 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>believe the Egyptians are maintaining contact in the event 
<br>there is a need for a quick shift in their approach. The 
<br>Egyptians are also marginally increasing cultural and 
<br>economic ties with Iran. The Egyptians are also concerned 
<br>about Iranian Shi'a proselytizing in Egypt. 
<br>
<br>----------------------- 
<br>EGIS Chief Omar Soliman 
<br>----------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) Soliman, the key GOE advisor on national security 
<br>policy after President Mubarak, recently told us that Egypt 
<br>has started a confrontation with Hezbollah and Iran and will 
<br>not allow Iran to operate in Egypt. Soliman has noted that 
<br>after the GOE's recent arrest of a Hizballah cell in the 
<br>Sinai, Egypt had sent a clear message to Iran that if they 
<br>interfere in Egypt, Egypt will interfere in Iran, adding that 
<br>EGIS had already begun recruiting agents in Iraq and Syria. 
<br>Soliman has warned us against only focusing on one issue at 
<br>time, such as Iran's nuclear weapons program. He believes 
<br>Iran must pay the price for its actions and not be allowed to 
<br>interfere in regional affairs. Soliman has offered GOE 
<br>cooperation on Iran, and welcomes a U.S.-Egyptian partnership 
<br>on combating Iranian influence in the region. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) Soliman recently noted that Iranian financial 
<br>support to Hamas amounted to $25 million a month, but that 
<br>Egypt was "succeeding" in preventing financial support from 
<br>entering Gaza through Egypt. According to Soliman, Iran has 
<br>tried several times to pay the salaries for the al-Qassam 
<br>Battalions, but Egypt had succeeded in preventing the money 
<br>from reaching Gaza. Soliman has expressed concern over 
<br>Hezbollah's first attempt to stand up a cell within Egypt, 
<br>and noted to us that Iran was also trying to recruit support 
<br>from the Sinai Bedouins, he claimed, in order to facilitate 
<br>arms smuggling to Gaza. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Aboul Gheit has speculated that the new U.S. 
<br>Administration will engage with Iran, but will be 
<br>disappointed in late 2009 or early 2010 when it realizes that 
<br>Iran will not stop its enrichment activities. Aboul Gheit 
<br>believes Israel may then attack Iran. According to Aboul 
<br>Gheit, the "intransigence" of Israel and Iran will place the 
<br>U.S. in an awkward position with the Islamic world. Aboul 
<br>Gheit will reiterate President Mubarak's strong opinion that 
<br>the only real solution is a nuclear free zone in the Middle 
<br>East, which would require Israel to give up its nuclear 
<br>weapons. Aboul Gheit believes that while the U.S. may not 
<br>perceive a nuclear-armed Israel as a threat, it is so 
<br>perceived throughout the Middle East. In the Foreign 
<br>Minister's opinion, if the U.S. pushed Israel to renounce 
<br>nuclear weapons, the U.S. and Arab governments would be in a 
<br>much stronger position to demand that Iran end its nuclear 
<br>program. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) MFA officials have made it clear to us that they do 
<br>not expect Israel to give up its nuclear weapons in the 
<br>absence of comprehensive regional peace; however, the GOE is 
<br>frustrated with what it perceives as a lack of political 
<br>progress in international fora to advance the Middle East 
<br>Resolution that came out of the 1995 Nuclear Proliferation 
<br>Treaty (NPT) Review Conference, which called in part for a 
<br>Middle East Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (MENWFZ). The GOE's 
<br>campaign for progress on the eventual establishment of a 
<br>MENWFZ -- even if the ultimate goal remains far in the future 
<br>-- will likely guide their approach to the 2009 NPT 
<br>Preparatory Conference in May and the 2010 NPT Review 
<br>Conference. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>Arab League Secretary-General Moussa 
<br>------------------------------------ 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Moussa has publicly and privately minimized Iran's 
<br>threat, claiming that the Arab world should strengthen its 
<br>economic and cultural ties with Iran. Moussa believes that 
<br>the Israeli-Palestinian conflict poses the greatest danger to 
<br>the region, and has consistently pressed the U.S. to do more 
<br>to stop Israeli settlement activity and advance the political 
<br>process between Israelis and Palestinians. The Arab League's 
<br>views on the importance of advancing a Middle East nuclear 
<br>weapons free zone are similar to those of the MFA. Moussa 
<br>also plays an important role in trying to manage intra-Arab 
<br>squabbles, including Qatar-Syria vs. Egypt-Saudi Arabia. The 
<br>Egyptians have made it clear that they consider the Qataris 
<br>
<br>CAIRO 00000722 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>"nouveau riche upstarts" who are trying to buy their way to 
<br>influence via big spending and posing as the "true" champions 
<br>of the Palestinian cause by allying themselves with Syria and 
<br>Iran. The Qatari attempt to invite Iran to the Doha Arab 
<br>League summit incensed the Egyptians, many of whom blamed 
<br>Moussa for mismanaging the issue. 
<br>
<br>---------------------- 
<br>Interior Minister Adly 
<br>---------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Interior Minister General Habib Al-Adly focuses on 
<br>counterterrorism and suppressing domestic political 
<br>opposition. He will not offer strategic analysis of Iran 
<br>role in the region, but should be able to provide details on 
<br>the nascent Hizballah cell in the Sinai, which the GOE 
<br>recently dismantled and arrested. Adly may also be able to 
<br>share information on the steps the GOE is taking to disrupt 
<br>the flow of Iranian-supplied arms from Sudan through Egypt to 
<br>Gaza. In March, he told us that Egyptian police had killed 
<br>arms smugglers trying to transfer weapons from Sudan into 
<br>Egypt (ref C). He has described GOE efforts to combat 
<br>smuggling over the long Egyptian-Sudanese border region as 
<br>"difficult." 
<br>
<br>------------- 
<br>Gamal Mubarak 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) Ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Assistant 
<br>Secretary-General and Presidential son Gamal Mubarak does not 
<br>currently play a significant role in Egypt's formal foreign 
<br>policy process, focusing instead on NDP matters and economic 
<br>development. Gamal's recent trip to Washington raised his 
<br>political profile in Egypt, and he is of course a possible 
<br>successor to his father. As a UK-trained former 
<br>international banker, Gamal is perhaps most at home 
<br>discussing economics and the current financial crisis. 
<br>
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>Internal Politics and Economics 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) We continue to promote democratic reform in Egypt, 
<br>including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism, 
<br>and respect for human rights. Egyptian democracy and human 
<br>rights efforts, however, are being stymied, and the GoE 
<br>remains skeptical of our role in democracy promotion, 
<br>complaining that any efforts to open up will result in 
<br>empowering the Muslim Brotherhood, which currently holds 86 
<br>seats in Egypt's 454-seat parliament. Economic reform is 
<br>ongoing although Egypt still suffers from widespread poverty 
<br>affecting 35-40% of the population. Egyptian-U.S. trade has 
<br>more than doubled in the last four years, reaching almost $9 
<br>billion in 2008. The U.S. exports to Egypt about twice as 
<br>much as it imports. Egyptian banks operate very 
<br>conservatively and have been spared involvement in risky 
<br>financial products, but the effects of the global economic 
<br>crisis on Egypt are beginning to be felt. As the global 
<br>credit crunch worsens, Egypt remains vulnerable as exports, 
<br>Suez Canal revenues, tourism, and remittances -- its largest 
<br>sources of revenue -- are all down and likely to continue to 
<br>fall.
