<br>
<br>Classified By: ECPO Minister Counselor William R. Stewart 
<br>for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Summary 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Egypt faces uncertainty as it moves towards a 
<br>post-Mubarak future. It has been almost exactly twenty-six 
<br>years since Egypt last faced such a transition. Although one 
<br>could argue that some of the elements that led to the 
<br>dramatic events of September and October 1981 are back in 
<br>place -- shortages of basic foodstuffs, external political 
<br>pressures, and crackdowns on political adversaries -- 
<br>tensions now are different, and not on the same scale. While 
<br>we should not place too much weight in analogy, it can 
<br>nevertheless be instructive to review the events of September 
<br>and October 1981 to see what useful comparisons can be made. 
<br>End summary. 
<br>
<br>--------------- 
<br>Rumors Run Amok 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) This September, as in past late summers, salon talk 
<br>and front page headlines have focused on that most sensitive 
<br>of topics: the health of the president and the eventual 
<br>transfer of power. Talk has been so pervasive, Prime 
<br>Minister Nazif felt obliged to announce that "there is a 
<br>system for the smooth transfer of power." Rumors of 
<br>President Mubarak's deteriorating health -- and even his 
<br>demise -- have been so insistent, even Suzanne Mubarak felt 
<br>the need to publicly assert that he is alive and well. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) At least half a dozen editorials have compared the 
<br>tensions and rumors of this September to September 1981. 
<br>Although the majority of Egyptians are too young to recall 
<br>personally those momentous times, the lore of it remains deep 
<br>in the national consciousness. Even young Egyptians recall 
<br>hearing of the great "round up" of September 3, 1981 when 
<br>Sadat seemed to "go crazy" as one commentator recalled, 
<br>arresting and imprisoning opponents and critics of every 
<br>stripe. Communists, Nasserists, Muslim Brothers, academics, 
<br>and liberal-minded journalists found themselves cell-mates 
<br>that late summer day. Even Coptic Pope Shenouda was placed 
<br>under house arrest. Although Mubarak has hardly gone so far, 
<br>some observers have argued that his feuds with Ayman Nour, 
<br>Anwar Esmat El-Sadat (the late president's nephew), Saad 
<br>Eddin Ibrahim, independent editors, and other perceived 
<br>opponents, combined with his sweeping roundup of the Muslim 
<br>Brotherhood -- arguably his only real political threat -- is 
<br>reminiscent of 1981, and they fear it could lead to similar 
<br>consequences. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>Mubarak Is No Sadat 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) According to some of Egypt's most astute political 
<br>observers, this is over-analyzing the situation and drawing 
<br>very wrong -- and dangerous - comparisons. Mohammed 
<br>El-Bassiouni, chairman of the Majlis al-Shura's National 
<br>Security Committee (which also has responsibility for Foreign 
<br>Affairs and Arab Affairs), believes that the two Septembers 
<br>have very little in common. El-Bassiouni recently told 
<br>MinCouns that in 1981, when he was Egypt's military attach 
<br>in Tel Aviv, President Sadat was under extreme pressure for 
<br>not providing the "peace dividend" he had promised would be 
<br>the result of his bold move towards Israel, and his deepening 
<br>friendship the United States. When prosperity for all did 
<br>not appear, Sadat felt under enormous pressure. Combined 
<br>with Egypt's isolation in the Arab world, it seemed that his 
<br>gamble had failed. In his pride, he lashed out at perceived 
<br>opponents. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>No Comparison? 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Such a scenario simply does not exist today, 
<br>El-Bassiouni opined. Egypt's economy is growing, the fruit 
<br>of President Mubarak's reform program launched in 2004. 
<br>While relations with Israel are still "problematic," Mubarak 
<br>has taken Egypt back to its rightful position as leader of 
<br>the Arab world. The external pressures that helped stoke the 
<br>tension of September 1981 "simply do not exist today." 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Another alleged similarity between the present and 
<br>Sadat's September is the shortage of basic commodities. 
<br>Egyptians have been angered in recent weeks by reports of 
<br>villages without access to drinking water -- in some cases, 
<br>for years (ref A). Shortages of subsidized bread have also 
<br>been in the headlines, as the poorest Egyptians wait in 
<br>queues for shrinking loaves. At least one observer has made 
<br>the case that September 2007 is more reminiscent of January 
<br>1977 -- when riots erupted throughout Egypt due to price 
<br>increases for bread and other basic foodstuffs -- than 
<br>September 1981. But Dr. Galal Amin, economics professor at 
<br>AUC (as he was in 1981) thinks there is little in common, 
<br>economically, between the two eras. Egypt under Sadat, he 
<br>argued, was actually better off in many ways: unemployment, 
<br>which he sees as the single greatest problem facing Mubarak 
<br>today, was lower then, and the overall standard of living was 
<br>higher. The average Egyptian, he said felt that 
<br>opportunities were greater in 1981, leading to general 
<br>optimism. Sadat's "infitah" program, opening up Egypt's 
<br>economy to foreign investment appeared to be working and 
<br>creating jobs. Tourism was taking off, and the average 
<br>Egyptian "felt good" about his life and better about his 
<br>future than Egyptians today, according to Amin. Economic 
<br>statistics refute Amin's assertions, but there is a 
<br>perception within a certain statist/elite/academic 
<br>demographic, represented by Amin, that somehow Sadat's were 
<br>"the good old days." 
<br>
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>Economic Reform Still Masks Underlying Woes 
<br>------------------------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Sadat trumpeted economic reform, touting 
<br>privatization, pointing to a freer market that would benefit 
<br>all Egyptians. These thoughts have been echoed under 
<br>Mubarak, especially since the appointment of Prime Minister 
<br>Nazif and his cabinet of economic reformers in 2004. 
<br>However, as in 1981, recent economic advances are incomplete. 
<br>Gigantic government subsidies then, as now, have served to 
<br>brake greater economic reform. In 1981, 21.5% of the Gross 
<br>National Income (GNI) went to the wealthiest 5% of the 
<br>population, while the poorest 20% of the population received 
<br>a mere 5% of Egypt's income. In 2007, there remains the 
<br>general sense that Egypt's economic growth is benefiting only 
<br>a tiny portion of the population. 17% of today's population 
<br>lives under the poverty line, almost identical to the 
<br>percentage in 1981, and the poorest 20% of the population 
<br>received 4.8% of the GNI in 2004/05, while the richest 10% of 
<br>the population received 30% of GNI. Although statistically 
<br>the standard of living has not dramatically deteriorated, 
<br>neither has it improved, leaving Egyptians with the feeling 
<br>that others have passed them by to a brighter economic 
<br>future. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>The Odd Couple 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) What the two periods unquestionably do have in common 
<br>are a pair of increasingly isolated dictators, set in their 
<br>ways and fearful of any kind of dissent. But though alike in 
<br>certain personal characteristics (particularly paranoia), 
<br>there are at the same time some very fundamental differences, 
<br>including age (Sadat was a robust 63 years old when 
<br>assassinated; Mubarak is a slowing 79) and length in office 
<br>(barely 11 years for Sadat, closing on 26 years for Mubarak). 
<br>Importantly, Sadat had a clear successor -- his vice 
<br>president, Hosni Mubarak. Mubarak, in turn, has scrupulously 
<br>avoided naming a VP, and although most believe that son Gamal 
<br>will succeed him, no one can say for certain how that will 
<br>play out. Another dissimilarity: Minister of Information 
<br>Enas El-Fiqi, under intense scrutiny and pressure himself for 
<br>allowing the rumors about Mubarak's health to get out of 
<br>control, recently told the Ambassador that "there is no 
<br>comparison" between Sadat and Mubarak because, "Mubarak never 
<br>loses his temper." (El-Fiqi, though, admitted that the 
<br>stress of his job was literally driving him to drink.) 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Mubarak relishes his self-image as a benign, paternal 
<br>leader, tough but fair. Still, he has shown signs of moving 
<br>toward Sadat's modus operandi in dealing with political 
<br>opponents. In the past year, Mubarak has arrested upwards of 
<br>a thousand Muslim Brothers. While some have subsequently 
<br>been released and only 40 are facing trial before a military 
<br>tribunal so far, the message is unmistakable: after allowing 
<br>the MB to participate in the 2005 parliamentary elections as 
<br>"independents" (in which they won 88 seats, 20% of the 
<br>Assembly), Mubarak is cracking down. Another similarity is 
<br>the recent phobia Mubarak has developed towards the press. 
<br>The Egyptian media, arguably as free as it has ever been (and 
<br>certainly freer than it was under Sadat), is suddenly facing 
<br>a cost for that liberty. In early September, four editors of 
<br>independent newspapers were convicted of insulting the 
<br>president and other GoE officials, while another editor is 
<br>facing trial October 1 for allegedly spreading false rumors 
<br>about Mubarak's health which were damaging to Egypt's 
<br>reputation and to its economy. These arrests have been 
<br>widely seen here as blatant attacks on the freedom of the 
<br>press, much as Sadat's rounding up of journalists was in 
<br>¶1981. 
<br>
<br>------------------------- 
<br>Love and Hate For the USA 
<br>------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) One of the more striking similarities between the two 
<br>leaders is their uneven relationship with the United States. 
<br>Sadat's September madness came close on the heels of a 
<br>profoundly disappointing trip to the United States to meet 
<br>the new President, Ronald Reagan. By discarding the Soviet 
<br>Union and reaching out to the United States -- and Israel -- 
<br>he had taken considerable political risk. He had calculated 
<br>that the payoff in tangible and intangible terms would more 
<br>than justify that risk. But as his international stature 
<br>increased spectacularly as the Arab world's "Man of Peace," 
<br>his standing at home did not keep pace, as heightened 
<br>expectations for peace and prosperity were unrealized. 
<br>Still, in the U.S. he felt he had found a faithful ally, one 
<br>that would stand by him even when his own people did not. 
<br>Unfortunately, President Reagan's reception of Sadat in 
<br>August 1981 was lukewarm, and Sadat came under severe 
<br>criticism by the U.S. press for not delivering true peace to 
<br>the Middle East. According to Mohamed Heikal, Sadat's former 
<br>Minister of Information (who was himself arrested on 
<br>September 3, 1981), Sadat returned to Egypt a bitter man, 
<br>feeling betrayed by the Americans. Shortly afterwards came 
<br>the arrests. 
<br>
<br>-------------- 
<br>Twin Twilights 
<br>-------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) At the end of the day, and the end of their reigns, 
<br>Sadat faced and Mubarak faces similar situations. But 
<br>Mubarak seems to have managed the dilemma better in at least 
<br>one key area: he has systematically and "legally" eliminated 
<br>virtually all political opposition, leaving only the MB 
<br>standing, having foresworn violence and politically 
<br>emasculated. Mubarak's internal security apparatus, an 
<br>estimated 1.4 million strong, is at least twice the size it 
<br>was under Sadat. Its ubiquitous presence and monopoly of the 
<br>legitimate use of armed power makes any kind of violent 
<br>change of leader unlikely. 
<br>
<br>--------------------- 
<br>The One Certain Thing 
<br>--------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) The two presidents share another undeniable point in 
<br>common: their mortality. Mubarak's street credibility, like 
<br>Sadat's, is very low. The was illustrated by the insistent 
<br>rumors of Mubarak's illness and death, despite numerous 
<br>official denials. This lack of faith by the people of Egypt 
<br>in their political leaders could well come back to haunt 
<br>Mubarak's successor, whomever he may be. Will it make the 
<br>transition more difficult? Yes. Will it matter in the end? 
<br>Probably not, as long as the successor enjoys the support of 
<br>the elite and the security apparatus, including the military. 
<br>And even if there is a valid analogy to draw between 
<br>September 1981 and September 2007, it is at best uneven. The 
<br>world -- and Egypt -- have fundamentally changed. While 
<br>President Mubarak clearly faces significant challenges, and 
<br>has reacted with at least some measure of Sadat's paranoia, 
<br>we do not foresee September 2007 leading to another October 
<br>¶1981.
