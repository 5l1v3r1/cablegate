<br>reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) SUMMARY: The Iranian response to the drawdown of U.S. 
<br>military forces in Iraq, and Iraq's evolving relationship 
<br>with Iran, will influence the climate for U.S. engagement 
<br>with Iran on our range of interests. The Iranians may see 
<br>the drawdown as an opportunity to strengthen their hand in 
<br>Iraq, akin to the opportunities they perceived after the fall 
<br>of Saddam in 2003. But they appear to have learned that 
<br>their proxy violence and efforts to strong-arm Iraqi 
<br>politicians generated more ill-will than influence. Iraqis 
<br>are now pushing back against malign Iranian influence. The 
<br>GOI cracked down on Iranian-backed militias and signed 
<br>long-term partnership agreements with the United States last 
<br>year, while this year Iraqi voters rewarded nationalist Iraqi 
<br>politicians in the provincial elections. At the same time, 
<br>Iraqis are buying Iranian products, accepting Iranian 
<br>investments, and welcoming Iranian visitors. The political 
<br>relationship between the countries is maturing, although 
<br>still scratchy. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S)(Summary continued) Iran in 2009 faces more 
<br>constraints in Iraq than it did in 2003. We expect the 
<br>Iranians will respond to the U.S. military drawdown under 
<br>these new constraints with violence targeted more closely at 
<br>the United States, more diplomatic outreach to Iraqi 
<br>politicians, and continued focus on trade and investment. 
<br>Consistent with ref A, our response must be targeted as well: 
<br>a vigorous response to security challenges, regional 
<br>diplomacy to help Iraq integrate with its neighbors and 
<br>internationally, and increased assistance to Iraq to build 
<br>its political and economic capacity to resist malign 
<br>influence from Iran. END SUMMARY. 
<br>
<br>--------------- 
<br>New environment 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S) The Quds Force (QF) -- the external operations arm of 
<br>the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) -- has directed 
<br>Iranian policy in Iraq since the fall of Saddam in 2003. The 
<br>IRGC-QF used its leverage with Shi'a political parties such 
<br>as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq 
<br>(SCIRI) to influence evolving Iraqi domestic politics, while 
<br>providing extensive logistical support and training to the 
<br>Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) militia and other extremist groups. 
<br>Tripartite discussions between the USG, GOI, and Iranian 
<br>government in Baghdad in 2007 made no immediate breakthroughs 
<br>toward reducing Iranian sponsorship of violence. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) The heavy-handed Iranian intervention backfired, 
<br>however, when the violent and undisciplined JAM alienated 
<br>many Iraqis, who also came to resent Iranian political 
<br>interference. In 2007, SCIRI changed its name to the Islamic 
<br>Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) to distance itself from its 
<br>Iranian and revolutionary origins, while PM Maliki's Da'wa 
<br>party has staked out a nationalist political position. With 
<br>ISCI's backing, Maliki directed Iraqi security forces to 
<br>challenge JAM control of Basra and Sadr City in 2008, 
<br>succeeding with the extensive but quiet assistance of MNF-I. 
<br>This success, along with growing popular distrust of Iran and 
<br>Iranian influence, contributed to Da'wa's strong showing over 
<br>ISCI in January 2009 provincial elections (ref B). Among 
<br>other recent Iranian setbacks in Iraq, the GOI signed the 
<br>Qother recent Iranian setbacks in Iraq, the GOI signed the 
<br>Security Agreement and Strategic Framework Agreement with the 
<br>USG despite Iranian objections. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) Dynamics other than the U.S. military drawdown will 
<br>affect Iranian influence in Iraq in coming years. Iraqis 
<br>will continue to accept legitimate Iranian investment and buy 
<br>Iranian electricity and manufactured goods as Iraqi domestic 
<br>production struggles to rebuild. Iranian agricultural produce 
<br>will continue to fill Iraqi markets as Iraqi farmers recover 
<br>from conflict, neglect, and a drought that has limited 
<br>production. The number of Iranian pilgrims and tourists, 
<br>already in the hundreds of thousands annually, will increase 
<br>with improvements in Iraqi security and tourism 
<br>infrastructure. As the Iraqi-Iranian bilateral relationship 
<br>matures with its positive advances and disputes, the 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00001104 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>governments will seek to deepen their cooperation on issues 
<br>such as de-mining, petroleum development and border security, 
<br>although disagreements over border demarcation and water 
<br>rights will continue to cause friction (ref G). 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) Just as Iraq will try to strengthen relations with 
<br>its Arab neighbors and Turkey to balance Iranian influence, 
<br>Iran will maintain regional influence through relations with 
<br>Syria and domestic influence in Iraq through its TV 
<br>broadcasts into Iraq and relations with Shia political 
<br>parties, the Kurds, and in fact any Iraqis who will have 
<br>them. Ultimately, Iraqi nationalism and self-reliance are 
<br>the most effective long-term defenses against Iranian 
<br>domination, and the degree and nature of Iranian influence in 
<br>Iraq will be determined less by the level of U.S. military 
<br>forces in Iraq than by the Iraqi political and economic 
<br>capacity to balance Iranian influence and channel it into 
<br>mutually beneficial areas. 
<br>
<br>-------- 
<br>Drawdown 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S/NF) While it initially criticized the Security 
<br>Agreement, intelligence reporting indicates that Iran is 
<br>beginning to take advantage of the new constraints on U.S. 
<br>military forces. Iranian officials have pressured the GOI to 
<br>close the Mujahedin-e Khalq's Camp Ashraf since the GOI 
<br>assumed security responsibility for it on January 1, as well 
<br>as release IRGC-QF officers detained by MNF-I in January 2007 
<br>as MNF-I turns detainees over to the GOI. (Note: MNF-I and 
<br>Embassy intend to hold the officers as long as legally 
<br>possible. End note.) Even as Iran publicly emphasizes 
<br>diplomatic and economic engagement in Iraq (ref C), the 
<br>IRGC-QF continues to support violent extremist groups such as 
<br>Kata'ib Hizbollah (KH), and Iran may have played a role in 
<br>the recent movement of the extremist group Asa'ib Ahl al-Haqq 
<br>(AAH) away from the political reconciliation process. MNF-I 
<br>analysts expect extremists to continue to use increasingly 
<br>deadly weapons supplied by Iran against U.S. forces this year 
<br>as U.S. forces move outside the cities and present targets 
<br>with little risk of collateral damage. MNF-I also expects 
<br>extremists to respond to the drawdown with attacks on U.S. 
<br>forces in an attempt to take credit for the U.S. departure. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) Likewise, the Iranian government will continue to 
<br>publicly portray the drawdown as a victory for the Iraqi 
<br>people and defeat for the United States, perhaps placing it 
<br>in the context of other U.S. military disengagements such as 
<br>Lebanon in 1984 and Somalia in 1993. After the Security 
<br>Agreement was approved, Iranian officials portrayed it 
<br>positively, emphasizing the stipulation that Iraq's territory 
<br>will not be used to attack a neighbor and that U.S. forces 
<br>would leave by the end of 2011. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) This public posturing may play on fears we've heard 
<br>from Basra to Anbar to Kurdistan that the U.S. drawdown will 
<br>create a vacuum that Iran will attempt to fill. But if Iran 
<br>adopts too high a public profile, it risks further backlash 
<br>because of nationalistic Iraqi pride as well as economic, 
<br>political and cultural grievances. For example, a Shia 
<br>member of the Council of Representatives warned us recently 
<br>of the pernicious effects of Iran on Shia religious doctrine, 
<br>seeking USG support for a media outlet for Iraqi Shi'a 
<br>clerics who will resist Iranian theology (ref D). Contacts of 
<br>REO Basra blame the rising price of housing on Iranian real 
<br>estate; likewise, Iranian agriculture is blamed for 
<br>undercutting local competition (ref E). The GOI is rejecting 
<br>Qundercutting local competition (ref E). The GOI is rejecting 
<br>Iranian claims to reinstate the 1975 Algiers Accord about the 
<br>Shatt al-Arab, and it is blaming Iranian dams for sharply 
<br>cutting water supplies reaching northeast. Maliki and his 
<br>team do not trust the Iranians and their militia games -- 
<br>Basra being a prime example, but also Sadr City and AAH. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) While some Iraqi fears of Iranian influence are 
<br>exaggerated, IRGC-QF operatives do expect a more permissive 
<br>operating environment as U.S. forces draw down (ref F). At 
<br>the same time, the drawdown will remove some threats the 
<br>Iranians perceive near the Iran-Iraq border. An Iranian 
<br>Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV) shot down by U.S. forces in 
<br>February was sent to scout two such targets: Camp Ashraf and 
<br>a U.S. military base. In the absence of such perceived 
<br>threats, and distracted by economic woes and internal 
<br>discord, it is possible that Iran will become less 
<br>preoccupied with security threats from Iraq. However, 
<br>considering Iran's long history of confrontation with Iraq, 
<br>its unease about enduring Iraqi-American cooperation, and its 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00001104 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>delegation of Iraq policy to the belligerent anti-American 
<br>IRGC-QF, Iran will likely continue to support extremists in 
<br>Iraq, perhaps building extremist groups into a Lebanese 
<br>Hezbollah-style political-military organization as a hedge 
<br>against a resurgent Iraqi central government. 
<br>
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>New challenges, USG response 
<br>---------------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) We will continue to assist the Iraqi government in 
<br>developing that capacity through political, diplomatic, 
<br>economic, rule of law, and security cooperation as outlined 
<br>in Embassy and MNF-I's Joint Campaign Plan and the Mission 
<br>Strategic Plan. Among current initiatives: the Local 
<br>Governance Program to strengthen local government 
<br>administrative capacity and civic engagement; assistance for 
<br>Iraqi farmers to develop the agricultural sector; training 
<br>for the Central Bank's Money Laundering Unit to combat 
<br>financial crime; engagement with Iraq's neighbors to 
<br>strengthen its regional integration; and advice for Iraqi 
<br>officials on an information strategy to respond to malign 
<br>Iranian interference in Iraqi affairs. Success in these 
<br>efforts requires a whole-of-government approach, and 
<br>sufficient funding for non-military initiatives is vital. 
<br>(Note: Ref F outlines a USG strategy for maintaining pressure 
<br>on the IRGC-QF in Iraq as U.S. military forces draw down.) 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) The view of Iran from Iraq is shaped by complaints 
<br>from Iraqi businessmen about Iranian competition, warnings 
<br>from Iraqis on the street about Iranian expansionism, 
<br>whispers from Iraqi politicians about Iranian influence, and 
<br>the occasional sound of Iranian munitions whistling overhead. 
<br>While none of these need necessarily affect the USG approach 
<br>on engagement with Iran, Iran's response to the drawdown of 
<br>U.S. military forces in Iraq will not improve the climate for 
<br>talks. In fact, elements of the Iranian government opposed to 
<br>engagement with America may use the instigation of violence 
<br>in Iraq as a spoiler. However, the Iraqi government and 
<br>Iraqi people are not as vulnerable as they were in 2003; they 
<br>are increasingly willing and able to defend their own 
<br>interests. Continued strengthening of the Iraqi-American 
<br>partnership will improve their capacity to counter and 
<br>balance Iranian influence, and keeping Iraq informed of our 
<br>progress on engagement with Iran will allay concerns that 
<br>Iraq's national interests are on the table.
