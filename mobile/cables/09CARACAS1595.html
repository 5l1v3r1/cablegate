<br>CLASSIFIED BY: DUDDY, AMBASSADOR, DOS, AMB; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
<br> 
<br>¶1.  (C) Summary:  President Chavez officially inaugurated Banco 
<br>Bicentenario on December 21, thus effectively re-opening three of 
<br>the eight banks the Venezuelan government (GBRV) has taken over or 
<br>shut down since November 20.  The National Assembly also passed 
<br>changes to the banking law to triple the amount of deposit 
<br>insurance, with the new limit applied retroactively to depositors 
<br>in the two banks in the process of liquidation.  If the episode of 
<br>interventions is indeed over, the GBRV will have increased its 
<br>share in the banking sector, gained an important foothold in the 
<br>insurance industry, and taken over a number of other companies, 
<br>particularly in the food processing and distribution sector.  While 
<br>the exact origin of the episode remains unclear, it appears to have 
<br>resulted from a combination of a power struggle among GBRV 
<br>officials and insiders and the precarious financial situation of 
<br>the banks themselves.  A major question mark remains Banco Federal, 
<br>a medium-sized bank owned by opposition businessman Nelson 
<br>Mezerhane.  Chavez and Mezerhane recently traded barbs, with 
<br>Mezerhane claiming forces associated with the GBRV were conspiring 
<br>to bring down his bank and Chavez characterizing Federal as "having 
<br>had grave problems."  End summary. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>New Steps in an Ongoing Saga 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶2.  (U) President Chavez launched a new state-run bank, Banco 
<br>Bicentenario, on December 21.  Bicentenario is essentially the 
<br>union of Banfoandes, a pre-existing public bank, with Central, 
<br>Bolivar, and Confederado, three of the eight banks the GBRV has 
<br>taken over or shut down since November 20 (refs A-D).  Depositors 
<br>in these four banks, who have not had access to their money since 
<br>November 30 (for Bolivar and Confederado) or December 4 (for 
<br>Central), can now transact business normally.  Taking figures 
<br>provided by the Superintendency of Banks (Sudeban) for commercial 
<br>and universal banks, the banks composing Bicentenario represented 
<br>5.3 percent of the banking sector by assets and 9.5 percent by 
<br>deposits as of November 30 (the latest statistics available).  The 
<br>extent to which depositors have withdrawn or will withdraw their 
<br>money remains to be seen, although there were no reports of long 
<br>lines at Bicentenario branches on December 21. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶3.  (U) On December 15 the National Assembly approved modifications 
<br>to the banking law that, among other things, will increase the 
<br>deposit guarantee offered by the Fund for Guarantee of Deposits and 
<br>Banking Protection (Fogade) from 10,000 bolivars (Bs; USD 4,650 at 
<br>the official exchange rate) to Bs 30,000, an amount requested by 
<br>President Chavez.  This increase will apply retroactively for a 
<br>limited period of time to depositors in Canarias and and Banpro, 
<br>the two banks in the process of liquidation.  Banks' contributions 
<br>to Fogade will also be raised from 0.5 to 1.5 percent of deposits 
<br>as maintained at the close of each semester.  (Note:  For these 
<br>changes to become law, President Chavez must sign the modified law 
<br>and it must be published in the Official Gazette.  To the best of 
<br>our knowledge, it has not yet been published.  President Chavez 
<br>recently said he might seek further changes to the law.  End note.) 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Is the Episode of Interventions Over? 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶4.  (C) Whether this episode of interventions is over remains a 
<br>question mark.  There are several other small banks and financial 
<br>institutions which fit the pattern of the eight banks intervened in 
<br> 
<br>CARACAS 00001595  002 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>the sense of being weak financially and having been taken over 
<br>recently by individuals allegedly close to the government.  Two 
<br>pending purchases, that of Inverunion by Gonzalo Tiraldo and Banco 
<br>Federal by Jose Zambrano, have reportedly been rejected by Sudeban. 
<br>Most but not all financial sector analysts and participants Econoff 
<br>has contacted continue to believe the episode poses no systemic 
<br>risk to the sector given the small sizes and weak reputations of 
<br>the banks involved, in comparison with the strong fundamentals of 
<br>most of the larger banks.  One dissenting voice is that of xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>reputation) and an outspoken critic of GBRV policies.  xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>called Econoff December 17 to report that, according to information 
<br>he had received, several medium-sized or large banks (or their 
<br>owners) were putting dollar-denominated assets into collateral 
<br>accounts in Florida in return for emergency loans in bolivars. 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶5.  (C) Banco Federal remains a major question mark.  As reported 
<br>previously (ref A), Federal, a medium-sized bank accounting for 3 
<br>percent of the sector by assets, is considered weak by several 
<br>experts, has been subject to several runs, and reportedly even 
<br>received an emergency loan from the GBRV.  Adding to the intrigue, 
<br>Federal's owner, opposition businessman and minority owner of 
<br>opposition TV station Globovision Nelson Mezerhane, recently traded 
<br>barbs with President Chavez.  In an interview published in local 
<br>daily El Mundo December 17, Mezerhane claimed "active laboratories" 
<br>that included "people with ties" to the GBRV had disseminated 
<br>rumors about Federal's health in an attempt to instigate runs. 
<br>Chavez lashed back in a December 19 broadcast, characterizing 
<br>Federal as a bank "that has had grave problems," ordering an 
<br>investigation into what Mezerhane said, and cautioning that "the 
<br>time in which public institutions help private banks like Federal 
<br>is over."  In an interview published December 20 in local weekly La 
<br>Razon, opposition economist Jose Guerra claimed former Vice 
<br>President and GBRV insider Jose Vicente Rangel was seeking to bring 
<br>down Federal, partly out of bitterness at the fall of his business 
<br>associate Pedro Torres (who led the group that owned three of the 
<br>intervened banks). 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>What Initiated the Episode in the First Place? 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶6.  (C) With over a month having passed since the initial 
<br>interventions, a number of theories have sprung up to explain why 
<br>the GBRV chose to act in the way it did and at the time it did. 
<br>Many observers believe President Chavez ordered the initial 
<br>interventions as the culmination of a power struggle taking place 
<br>among GBRV officials and presumed insiders.  Theories on the 
<br>protagonists in this presumed power struggle abound, however.  We 
<br>have heard variations such as Diosdado Cabello vs. Ricardo 
<br>Fernandez and Jesse Chacon; Ali Rodriguez and representatives of 
<br>the traditional left vs. Ricardo Fernandez and members of the 
<br>military clique; and President Chavez vs. selected inner circle 
<br>members and insiders with their own political projects.  An 
<br>intriguing tangent is that an alleged report by Cuba's intelligence 
<br>service plays a role in several of these explanations.  Other 
<br>observers believe the GBRV's hand was forced by the terrible 
<br>financial situation at the intervened banks, with President Chavez 
<br>preferring to take action before the problems worsened and well 
<br>before parliamentary elections scheduled for September 2010. 
<br>Whatever the origins of the episode, our contacts credit President 
<br>Chavez with seeing the interventions as an opportunity to trumpet 
<br>anti-corruption credentials by sending the message, as one of our 
<br>contacts put it, of "I put bankers in jail." 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Changes in the Financial Sector and Business Landscape 
<br> 
<br>CARACAS 00001595  003 OF 003 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶7.  (C) The intervention episode has to date led to several changes 
<br>in the financial and business landscape that are worth noting. 
<br>First, the GBRV has increased its share in the banking sector by at 
<br>least five percentage points.  With the opening of Banco 
<br>Bicentenario, public banks will comprise roughly 20 percent of the 
<br>sector by assets and 25 percent by deposits.  Second, the GBRV has 
<br>acquired an important foothold in the insurance sector with the 
<br>associated takeover of Seguros La Previsora and intended formation 
<br>of state-owned Bolivariana de Seguros (ref B).  (Note:  As of June 
<br>2009, La Previsora was the fourth largest insurance company in 
<br>Venezuela with market share of 8.3 percent.  End note.)  Many 
<br>contacts, including xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxbelieve the GBRV will 
<br>consolidate the insurance accounts 
<br>
<br>position to exert greater control over private medical services 
<br>providers.  Finally, GBRV takeover of Ricardo Fernandez's companies 
<br>in the food and food distribution sectors will further the shift 
<br>toward GBRV control in those sectors.  (Note:  It is still unclear 
<br>from GBRV statements if the takeover of Fernandez's companies will 
<br>be temporary or permanent.  We would not be surprised if it were 
<br>the latter.  End note.) 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>Comment 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>¶8.  (C) As we suspected when it began on November 20, much about 
<br>this episode remains obscure.  We are not surprised that there are 
<br>conflicting explanations for how the episode started, though it 
<br>seems clear internal power struggles played a key role.  What is 
<br>still a mystery to us is why the GBRV has not yet used this episode 
<br>as an excuse to take over Banco Federal, thus taking an important 
<br>asset from Nelson Mezerhane.  While we would have expected the GBRV 
<br>to have taken it over several weeks ago if it indeed it was going 
<br>to, the exchange of barbs between Mezerhane and Chavez certainly 
<br>keeps the possibility alive.  Perhaps the GBRV has not moved to 
<br>take Federal because it fears systemic implications:  in a clear 
<br>reference to Federal, respected economic consultancy Sintesis 
<br>Financiera wrote in a recent report that "concerns will rise and 
<br>markets will destabilize if interventions reach larger banks owned 
<br>by individuals perceived to be at odds with the government."  There 
<br>could certainly be other explanations, however.  End comment.
