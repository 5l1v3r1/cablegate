<br>IRANIAN RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE 
<br>
<br>REF: BAGHDAD 342 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Minister-Counselor for Political Military Affairs Michae 
<br>l Corbin for reasons 1.4 (b, d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) Summary: Ayad Jamaleddin, a Council of 
<br>Representatives member from the secular Iraqiyya list, 
<br>painted an extreme view of Iranian religious influence in 
<br>Iraq during a meeting with Emboffs on February 11. Claiming 
<br>that Iran is paying clerics across Iraq to deliver Friday 
<br>sermons sympathetic to Iran and its political theology, 
<br>Jamaleddin stated he had been urged by an emissary of 
<br>Ayatollah Muhammad Sayyid Al-Hakim, a first cousin of 
<br>Abdelaziz Al-Hakim and a potential heir to Ayatollah Sistani, 
<br>to spread the warning about Iranian influence in Iraq. 
<br>Jamaleddin warned of "Iran's ability to summon sleeping 
<br>militias across Iraq" to resume attacks and alleged that 
<br>Iraqi politicians were visiting an Iranian intelligence 
<br>officer in Qom, Iran, under the cover of pilgrimage. 
<br>Although secular in politics, Jamaleddin wears the black 
<br>turban of a sayyed, a descent of the Prophet, and was most 
<br>animated about the pernicious effects of Iran on Shi'a 
<br>religious doctrine. He urged the USG to provide a media 
<br>outlet for Shi'a clerics who will resist Iranian theology. 
<br>End summary. 
<br>
<br>¶2. (U) Media outlets including Al-Arabiyah satellite 
<br>channel have carried interviews recently with Ayad 
<br>Jamaleddin, a parliamentarian elected on Ayad Alawi's secular 
<br>nationalist Iraqiyya list, warning of Iran's encroaching 
<br>influence in Iraq. Jamaleddin told al-Arabiyah on January 20 
<br>that a "quick and hasty U.S. withdrawal from Iraq means 
<br>turning Iraq into an Iranian governorate," emphasizing that 
<br>an Iranian presence in Iraq is more dangerous than an 
<br>American presence in Iraq. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Jamaleddin is among several contacts who have 
<br>reached out to the Embassy recently to warn about Iranian 
<br>influence, which is a favorite topic of conversation among a 
<br>wide range of Iraqis. He claims to be carrying the message 
<br>of Ayatollah Muhammad Sayyid Al-Hakim, a potential heir to 
<br>Ayatollah Sistani and first cousin of Abdelaziz Al-Hakim, 
<br>head of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI), the 
<br>political party closest to Iran. Despite Al-Hakim's ISCI 
<br>family ties, he urged Jamaladdin through an emissary to "go 
<br>to Washington, to Tel Aviv, anywhere" to seek help to stop 
<br>Iran,s nefarious project to subjugate Iraq, according to 
<br>Jamaleddin. Jamaleddin said he was surprised this message 
<br>was coming from the Ayatollah, but the emissary maintained 
<br>that Iran's aggressive efforts had struck terror into the 
<br>hearts of the entire Najafi clerical establishment. 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Specifically, Jamaleddin claimed to us that Iran is 
<br>paying "10,000" imams across southern Iraq $200 USD a month 
<br>to deliver Friday sermons that inspire the faithful with 
<br>righteous rhetoric and subtly include a positive gloss on 
<br>Iran. In our meeting February 11 and an earlier meeting 
<br>February 9, he repeated several times that he was not afraid 
<br>for himself or Iraq, but rather the whole region, claiming 
<br>that Iran is already controlling Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. He 
<br>emphasizing that the Khomeini ideology of 
<br>wilayat al-Faqih (jurisdiction of clerics) is "the most vile, 
<br>Satanic ideology" ever devised by man "it's much worse than 
<br>Nazism." 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) As for Iraq, he said, every member of the Iraqi 
<br>cabinet who travels to Iran visits the religious center of 
<br>Qom to pay homage to Jawwad Shahristani, who he identified as 
<br>the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) 
<br>Qthe Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) 
<br>official responsible for Iraq. They go to Qom as if they are 
<br>going to pray at the Ka'ba (in Mecca), he said, citing in 
<br>particular GoI spokesman Ali Dabbagh. He added that 
<br>Shahristani is the son-in-law of Grand Ayatollah Sistani and 
<br>head of Sistani's office in Qom. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) We pressed Jamaleddin on his contention that Iranian 
<br>influence in Iraq is increasing, noting that Iraq had signed 
<br>the Security Agreement and Strategic Framework Agreement with 
<br>the USG despite Iranian opposition and that in visits to 
<br>Basra, for instance, we hear from many Iraqis who hate Iran 
<br>because of their memories of the Iran-Iraq war and, more 
<br>recently, Iranian-sponsored militia violence. He responded 
<br>that "they hate Iran, but they don't hate money." He 
<br>compared the Iran-Iraq relationship to the Syria-Lebanon 
<br>relationship, saying that Syria controls Lebanon even though 
<br>Lebanese are, like Iraqis, 
<br>strong and independent people who seek to be free from 
<br>foreign influence. Likewise we pressed Jamaleddin on his 
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00000383 002 OF 002 
<br>
<br>
<br>contention that Iran controls militias in southern Iraq, 
<br>noting that the violence has decreased from the period of a 
<br>year or two ago. He responded that Iranian-sponsored 
<br>militias have hidden weapons and retain the ability to rise 
<br>up if summoned by Iran. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) When asked what the appropriate USG response should 
<br>be, he urged us to stop "supporting" Iranian-sponsored 
<br>political parties such as ISCI. He did not dispute our 
<br>response that in fact the USG does not support any particular 
<br>party or politician, and in fact urged us to provide media 
<br>access to clerics who are willing to stand up to Iran. He 
<br>mentioned in particular a Lebanese cleric he identified as 
<br>Ayatollah Ali al-Amin. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Comment: Jamaleddin's extreme anti-Iranian rhetoric 
<br>is nothing unusual; we hear such sentiments frequently, 
<br>although not always with so much colorful detail. However, 
<br>it is notable that he claims to be carrying the message of 
<br>Ayatollah Muhammad Sayyid Al-Hakim and that the ISCI setback 
<br>in the January 31 provincial elections, which is generally 
<br>viewed as a setback to Iran (reftel), has done nothing to 
<br>mitigate his concerns about Iranian influence.
