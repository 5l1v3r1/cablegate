<br>SUBJECT: CODEL KERRY MEETING WITH PRESIDENT MUBARAK 
<br> 
<br>Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey, for reasons 
<br>1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br> 
<br>¶1. (C) Summary: On July 2, Senator Kerry and the Ambassador 
<br>discussed regional developments with President Hosni Mubarak, 
<br>including Zimbabwe, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, and Israel-Palestine. 
<br>Mubarak said that Egypt was working to find a solution in 
<br>Sudan, but preferred to do so "quietly."  Mubarak warned 
<br>against a precipitous U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.  While he 
<br>called Iranians "liars" and said they sponsor terrorism, he 
<br>opined that no Arab state would join the U.S. in a formal 
<br>defense alliance against Iran for fear of retaliation. 
<br>Mubarak expressed frustration with the Israeli-Palestinian 
<br>peace process, and was particularly disparaging about the 
<br>lack of Palestinian unity.  End summary. 
<br> 
<br>------------------- 
<br>AU "Soft" on Mugabe 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶2. (C) In a 60-minute meeting with President Mubarak in Sharm 
<br>El-Sheikh, Senator Kerry began by asking for Mubarak's views 
<br>on the discussions at the African Union Summit, which had 
<br>concluded in Sharm El-Sheikh the previous day. Mubarak said 
<br>he had been at the Summit until late in the evening and was 
<br>tired. He reported that some member states had condemned 
<br>Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, while others told him to 
<br>form a national unity government and find a role for the 
<br>opposition parties. Mubarak said he couldn't prevent Mugabe 
<br>from attending the conference in Egypt because Zimbabwe is a 
<br>member of the African Union. He said the British were behind 
<br>this "big fuss" and that the pressure from other African 
<br>leaders was "sufficiently soft that Mugabe can do what he 
<br>wants." 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br>Sudan:  Quiet Diplomacy Is Best 
<br>------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶3. (C) In response to Senator Kerry's query about the 
<br>situation in Sudan, Mubarak said the issue was not discussed 
<br>publicly at the AU summit. He also said "this issue could 
<br>have been worked out" if it were not debated so publicly 
<br>because "two tribes always work things out." Mubarak noted 
<br>Egypt's attempts to "try and help the (Sudanese) people" 
<br>through the Egyptian hospital in Sudan and the efforts of 
<br>EGIS Director Omar Suleiman to advise on North-South 
<br>negotiations. 
<br> 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br>Iraq:  Don't Pull Out Too Soon 
<br>------------------------------ 
<br> 
<br>¶4. (C) Turning to Iraq, Senator Kerry asked Mubarak if he had 
<br>changed his opinion of Prime Minister Al Maliki after Iraq's 
<br>successful stabilization efforts in Basra and Sadr City. 
<br>Mubarak said he "I am not critical. He came to Cairo.  I gave 
<br>him my phone number but he hasn't called us." He noted that 
<br>Egypt offered to host and train Iraqi forces, but that the 
<br>offer had not been acted upon by the Iraqis.  He said the 
<br>U.S. "cannot withdraw until you strengthen the armed forces 
<br>and police. Until then you have to stay." 
<br> 
<br>------------------- 
<br>Beware The Iranians 
<br>------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶5. (C) Mubarak's top concern for the stability of Iraq and 
<br>the region is Iran. He believes that "as a result of the 
<br>invasion of Iraq, Iran is spreading everywhere." He urged the 
<br>U.S. to be wary of what Iran says. "They are big, fat liars 
<br>and justify their lies because they believe it is for a 
<br>higher purpose." He said he believes this opinion is shared 
<br>by other leaders in the region. Nonetheless, he opined that 
<br>no Arab state will join the U.S. in a defense relationship 
<br>vis-a-vis Iran out of fear of "sabotage and Iranian 
<br>terrorism." He said Iran's sponsorship of terrorism is 
<br>"well-known but I cannot say it publicly. It would create a 
<br>dangerous situation." Mubarak said that sanctions are the 
<br>best hope for containing Iran, but Arab states won't dare to 
<br>endorse them. 
<br> 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br>Not Optimistic on The Peace Process 
<br>----------------------------------- 
<br> 
<br>¶6. (C) On the Middle East Peace Process, Mubarak said he sees 
<br>no progress between Syria and Israel and doesn't expect any 
<br>progress between Israel and the PA leadership. He said that 
<br>"Palestinians are quarrelling" and Hamas and other factions 
<br>will reject any agreement made by Abu Mazen. Senator Kerry 
<br> 
<br>CAIRO 00001637  002 OF 002 
<br> 
<br> 
<br>suggested the parties appeared to be close in some areas. In 
<br>response, Mubarak reiterated he doesn't believe the many 
<br>Palestinian factions will reach agreement and, thus, they 
<br>only serve to undermine Abu Mazen's efforts. 
<br> 
<br>¶7. (C) This cable was not cleared by CODEL Kerry.
