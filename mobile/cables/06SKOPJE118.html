<br>SUMMARY 
<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) PM Buckovski told the Ambassador February 1 that 
<br>parliamentary elections likely will be held in late 
<br>June/early July, and that he expects the opposition to use 
<br>rough campaign and electoral tactics in trying to replace his 
<br>government. On Macedonia's NATO accession prospects, he 
<br>agreed the government must do more to coordinate 
<br>anti-corruption efforts and to ensure aggressive prosecution 
<br>of corruption cases. The GOM will ask the ICTY to delay the 
<br>return of four potential war crimes cases until at least the 
<br>end of 2006. Buckovski believes Kosovo final status should 
<br>be determined "the sooner the better" in order to safeguard 
<br>regional stability; he is convinced final status ultimately 
<br>will end in independence. The GOM will keep its head down 
<br>and guard up regarding allegations that Macedonia has 
<br>assisted the USG in the "el-Masri" case that has captured 
<br>local media attention. With the 2006 parliamentary elections 
<br>in mind and campaigning about to begin in the next several 
<br>months, Buckovski wants to portray himself as a pragmatic 
<br>leader, and to ensure that none of his policy stances differs 
<br>significantly from ours. End Summary. 
<br>
<br>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN EARLY SUMMER, CONCERNS ABOUT 
<br>OPPOSITION TACTICS 
<br>
<br>¶2. (C) During a dinner with Ambassador, DCM, DATT, and P/E 
<br>Chief on February 1, PM Buckovski said parliamentary 
<br>elections likely would be held in late June or early July to 
<br>allow the next government to organize itself during the 
<br>summer. The draft electoral code would enter parliamentary 
<br>debate by the first week of March, with passage expected by 
<br>mid-March. Buckovski, who was accompanied by his foreign 
<br>policy and national security advisers, said he was hopeful 
<br>the parliament would have passed important judicial reform 
<br>laws (on the police and on the courts) before the election 
<br>date. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Buckovski said he was concerned that opposition 
<br>center-right party VMRO-DPMNE would play a "destructive" role 
<br>during the electoral campaign and elections. He cited recent 
<br>demonstrations by unemployed tobacco workers from Kumanovo 
<br>and Prilep, and ongoing street blockades by an NGO protesting 
<br>government plans to privatize the state electrical power 
<br>company, as typical examples of VMRO-DPMNE destabilization 
<br>tactics. (Comment: We agree there was a partisan political 
<br>dimension to the protests, in addition to the underlying 
<br>socio-economic complaints by workers and citizens. End 
<br>Comment.) 
<br>
<br>¶4. (C) Noting VMRO-DPMNE objections to government plans to 
<br>staff local election boards with civil servants, Buckovski 
<br>said that previous elections had been marred by the 
<br>appointment of political party members to those boards, which 
<br>made the board members susceptible to manipulation and fraud. 
<br>The government proposal would, he claimed, be more 
<br>reassuring to voters, especially in primarily ethnic Albanian 
<br>areas where fraud had typically been most prevalent. Ethnic 
<br>Albanians would put more stock in the integrity of civil 
<br>service professionals than they would in party 
<br>representatives. 
<br>
<br>DPA'S RETURN TO PARLIAMENT 
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) Buckovski thanked Ambassador for her constructive role 
<br>in persuading the ethnic Albanian opposition party DPA to 
<br>return to the Parliament after a 9-month hiatus to protest 
<br>irregularities during local elections last March and April 
<br>(reftel). He said that he would welcome receiving DPA's 
<br>suggestions for amendments to the draft electoral code, and 
<br>would discuss those amendments the following day (February 2) 
<br>with a DPA representative. During the conversation, 
<br>Buckovski spoke by phone with DPA Vice President Menduh 
<br>Thaci, and with Speaker of Parliament Jordanovski, to arrange 
<br>for DPA's return to Parliament the week of February 6. 
<br>
<br>NATO ACCESSION 
<br>
<br>
<br>SKOPJE 00000118 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Ambassador briefed Buckovski on the upcoming visit by 
<br>a high-level US delegation to review Macedonia's progress 
<br>toward meeting its MAP goals. She said it would be important 
<br>for Macedonia to demonstrate that it was a net contributor to 
<br>security. The country had to convince some skeptical NATO 
<br>members that bringing Macedonia into the Alliance would not 
<br>be tantamount to "importing instability." Also, the GOM 
<br>would have do more to combat corruption, including better 
<br>coordination of existing anti-corruption efforts and more 
<br>aggressive efforts to prosecute high-level corruption cases. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Buckovski agreed that more needed to be done to fight 
<br>corruption. He accepted the need for stronger coordination, 
<br>and said Foreign Policy Adviser Mersel Biljali was in charge 
<br>of "finding a methodology" for tackling the problem. 
<br>Buckovski noted his personal ties to both the Public 
<br>Prosecutor ("a friend") and the Minister of Justice (a former 
<br>law student of his) and even offered personally to head the 
<br>effort to improve coordination among the various judicial 
<br>agencies to enhance anti-corruption efforts. 
<br>
<br>ICTY RETURN OF CASES -- REQUEST FOR DELAY 
<br>
<br>¶8. (C) Responding to the Ambassador's request for an update 
<br>on the status of the return of four unindicted cases from the 
<br>ICTY to Macedonian jurisdiction, Buckovski said that Chief 
<br>Public Prosecutor Prcevski would meet with ICTY investigators 
<br>in late February to ask orally for a delay in the return. 
<br>Buckovski did not want a paper trail or any documentation of 
<br>the request for a delay, since that could later be used by 
<br>the opposition to attack the government for being soft on the 
<br>ethnic Albanians (all four cases involved eAlbanians alleged 
<br>to have committed war crimes during the 2001 internal armed 
<br>conflict.) 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) Comment: Buckovski's information was at odds with FM 
<br>Mitreva's report to the EU Special Representative this week 
<br>that Prcevski would travel to The Hague on February 2 to 
<br>request the delayed return of cases. This discrepancy 
<br>reflects the general lack of coordination on this matter 
<br>between the Prime Minister, Mitreva, and the President -- the 
<br>only three GOM officials with the authority to make decisions 
<br>regarding the return of cases. Buckovski reportedly told the 
<br>press on February 2 that he expected the return of cases "to 
<br>coincide with completion of the judicial reforms," and that 
<br>the cases likely would be returned "by the end of 2006." End 
<br>Comment. 
<br>
<br>KOSOVO FINAL STATUS 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) On Kosovo final status, Buckovski said he could see 
<br>no other possible outcome but independence. He said he 
<br>agreed with the US position, that Kosovo final status should 
<br>be determined "the sooner, the better" to reduce the 
<br>potential for future instability in the region. As a 
<br>positive example to Kosovo and the region of Macedonia's 
<br>multi-ethnic experience, he said, the GOM planned to host in 
<br>Ohrid in August the 5th anniversary commemoration of the 
<br>signing of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which ended the 
<br>2001 internal armed conflict in Macedonia. Buckovski said he 
<br>hoped for high-level representation at the event from those 
<br>countries and organizations that had signed the original 
<br>agreement, in particular the U.S. and EU. 
<br>
<br>EL-MASRI: STAY THE COURSE 
<br>
<br>¶11. (C/NOFORN) Concerning the case of a German citizen of 
<br>Lebanese descent who has claimed that Macedonian authorities 
<br>detained him in January 2004 and handed him over to the CIA 
<br>for a rendition flight to Afghanistan, Buckovski noted that 
<br>the GOM would stay the course and would continue to support 
<br>the Minister of Interior, who has declined to discuss the 
<br>matter with the local press. Buckovski was relieved to hear 
<br>from the Ambassador that we would not shift course, either, 
<br>and would continue to decline to discuss in public specific 
<br>cases. The Prime Minister suggested that the Ambassador 
<br>coordinate on the issue with the German Embassy in Skopje, 
<br>suggesting that the Germans were putting pressure on the 
<br>Macedonians to be more forthcoming. The Ambassador demurred. 
<br>
<br>TRILATERAL MEETING ALONG A-3 LINES 
<br>
<br>
<br>SKOPJE 00000118 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶12. (SBU) Buckovski mentioned that he was organizing a 
<br>"trilateral meeting" in Tirana with his Albanian and Croatian 
<br>counterparts (mirroring the Adriatic Partnership), and hoped 
<br>the U.S. Ambassador in Tirana would be able to participate. 
<br>He gave no specifics regarding the objective of the meeting, 
<br>other than to mention that it would strengthen regional 
<br>cooperation. 
<br>
<br>COMMENT 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) Buckovski characterized the dinner as a chance to 
<br>further strengthen the close cooperation between the Embassy 
<br>and his office. He pledged "open and frank" communication 
<br>between his office and the Embassy, and suggested Macedonia 
<br>continues to view the U.S. as its single most important 
<br>"strategic partner." Buckovski clearly was eager to get 
<br>feedback on sensitive issues, and to portray himself as a 
<br>pragmatic leader who can listen to arguments at odds with his 
<br>own views, and who is ready to compromise when needed. With 
<br>parliamentary elections likely in summer 2006 and the 
<br>campaign season about to begin, Buckovski also feels it is 
<br>necessary to show that he has international community 
<br>support, especially from the US, and that his policy stances 
<br>do not conflict with ours on any high-profile matters.
