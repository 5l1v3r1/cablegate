<br>
<br>¶1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: The Bundestag is expected to approve on
<br>October 16 a 14-month extension of the parliamentary mandate
<br>that authorizes Bundeswehr participation in the NATO ISAF
<br>mission in Afghanistan. The renewed ISAF mandate will
<br>continue to limit German forces essentially to the north of
<br>Afghanistan, although provisions for deploying some
<br>non-combat support in the rest of the country will be spelled
<br>out for the first time. The renewed mandate will have a
<br>significantly higher troop ceiling (an increase from 3,500 to
<br>4,500), allowing Germany to fulfill its commitments on ANA
<br>training and offering additional flexibility in responding to
<br>crisis situations and in surging forces in support of the
<br>Afghan presidential election. The renewed ISAF mandate will
<br>not include authorization to participate in the planned NATO
<br>AWACS mission, thereby requiring the government to seek a
<br>separate stand-alone mandate once there is a NATO decision.
<br>The new mandate will also not include expanded authority to
<br>conduct counternarcotics interdiction, as has been requested
<br>by SACEUR. Meanwhile, Chancellor Merkel, FM Steinmeier and
<br>DefMin Jung have agreed to eliminate the German Special
<br>Forces (KSK) element from the separate OEF parliamentary
<br>mandate when it comes up for renewal in November. Steinmeier
<br>and the SPD have been spinning this in the media as an SPD
<br>success, much to the annoyance of the Chancellery.
<br>Eliminating the controversial KSK element -- which has gone
<br>unused for the past four years -- was seen as a price to pay
<br>to ensure strong parliamentary support (especially in the
<br>SPD) for renewal of the ISAF mandate. The elimination of the
<br>KSK element from the OEF mandate may open opportunities for
<br>the USG to press Germany to increase its Special Forces
<br>capability within ISAF. END SUMMARY.
<br>
<br>Large majority expected for mandate renewal
<br>
<br>¶2. (SBU) The German cabinet agreed October 7 to seek a
<br>14-month extension of the parliamentary mandate that
<br>authorizes Bundeswehr participation in the NATO ISAF mission
<br>in Afghanistan. This longer mandate (the normal mandate
<br>period is one year) is intended to ensure that the
<br>mandate will not come up for renewal until after the seating
<br>of the new Bundestag following the September 2009
<br>parliamentary election, diminishing Afghanistan as a campaign
<br>issue next year. The Bundestag held the first reading of the
<br>draft mandate right after cabinet approval
<br>and is scheduled to vote on it October 16. All indications
<br>are that the mandate extension will be approved by a wide
<br>margin, with all the Bundestag parties supporting it, except
<br>for the small Left Party, which opposes all overseas
<br>deployments and which has consistently voted as a solid block
<br>against the mandate. Most Green Party parliamentarians
<br>either abstained or voted against the mandate last year, but
<br>are expected to support it this time around, given that their
<br>concerns about the possible combat role of the German Tornado
<br>reconnaissance aircraft under the mandate have not
<br>materialized.
<br>
<br>Rolling-over the previous mandate
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) The proposed mandate is similar to the existing one,
<br>which essentially limits German forces to the north of
<br>Afghanistan. The mandate technically allows deployments,
<br>limited in time and scope, outside the north on an
<br>exceptional basis, if deemed by the German defense
<br>minister to be absolutely essential to the ISAF mission. But
<br>up to now, the German government has been very reluctant to
<br>exercise this authority in regard to combat forces. For
<br>example, the government still does not allow German
<br>Operational and Mentoring Liaison Teams (OMLTs) to
<br>accompany their assigned Afghan National Army (ANA) units on
<br>deployments outside the north. With less than a year to go
<br>before Bundestag elections, we anticipate the government will
<br>remain exceedingly cautious and conservative in making use of
<br>the exception in the mandate.
<br>
<br>New features in renewed mandate
<br>
<br>¶4. (SBU) While the renewed mandate will be mostly unchanged,
<br>there are a few notable improvements:
<br>
<br>-- Increase in the troop ceiling from the 3,500 to 4,500:
<br>Germany is currently right up against the 3,500 troop ceiling
<br>because of the need over the past several months to
<br>deploy additional troops to respond to the deteriorating
<br>security situation in the north, to fill in for departing
<br>Allied troops (primarily Czech and Danish soldiers who
<br>re-deployed to the south and east), and to take on new tasks
<br>(like the 200-man RC-North Quick Reaction Force). Defense
<br>Minister Jung has emphasized that the increase in the troop
<br>ceiling does not mean Germany will be sending an additional
<br>1,000 soldiers to Afghanistan immediately. While there may
<br>be a small increase in troops right away (up to 3,800 or
<br>3,900) so that Germany can fulfill its previous ANA training
<br>commitments, the rest of the additional troop authorization
<br>will be held in reserve. It will be used to give military
<br>leaders additional flexibility in responding to crisis
<br>situations and in surging forces in support of the 2009
<br>Afghan presidential elections.
<br>
<br>-- Blanket authorization to exceed the troop ceiling during
<br>rotations: This will give the Bundeswehr more flexibility in
<br>moving units in and out of Afghanistan without having to
<br>worry about temporarily exceeding the troop ceiling.
<br>
<br>-- Explicit permission for certain units and assets to
<br>operate throughout Afghanistan: Some 30 radio operators have
<br>been based in Kandahar for more than a year under the
<br>exception in the mandate that allows time-limited deployments
<br>outside the north. Under the new mandate, they
<br>will be covered as a permanent deployment. Other assets and
<br>personnel that will be included in this category:
<br>Psychological operations personnel, Tornado reconnaissance
<br>aircraft, C-160 aircraft providing intra-theater airlift, and
<br>MEDEVAC helicopters.
<br>
<br>No authorization for awacs
<br>
<br>¶5. (C) After much hand-wringing over the summer about the
<br>potential impact on maintaining a strict divide between
<br>Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and ISAF (ref A), the
<br>government was prepared to include an authorization in the
<br>renewed ISAF mandate for German air crews to
<br>participate in the proposed NATO AWACS mission in
<br>Afghanistan. But those plans were dashed in late September
<br>when France blocked a NATO decision giving the green light
<br>for planning the mission. MFA officials have rejected
<br>including language in the renewed ISAF mandate that would
<br>anticipate a future NATO decision on AWACS, claiming that the
<br>Bundestag would oppose this as a "blank check." As a result,
<br>the renewed ISAF mandate will be completely silent
<br>on the issue, requiring, therefore, the government to seek a
<br>separate stand-alone mandate on AWACS later once there is a
<br>NATO decision authorizing the mission. We have been assured
<br>by senior sources in the Chancellery (protect) that Germany
<br>will approve the required mandate for the deployment of
<br>German AWACS crews, once NATO approves the AWACS mission.
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) Current thinking in the MFA is that the government
<br>will not seek a AWACS mandate until the end of the NATO
<br>decision-making process, when all the details over financing
<br>and stationing of the NATO AWACS have been worked out. This
<br>ensures that there will be a decent interval between approval
<br>of the ISAF mandate and the need for the government to go
<br>back to the Bundestag for the stand-alone AWACS mandate. MFA
<br>officials acknowledge that waiting until the end of the
<br>process to seek Bundestag authorization also ensures that
<br>they do not waste political capital on obtaining a mandate
<br>that may never be used because of possible problems or delays
<br>in NATO decision-making.
<br>
<br>No additional authority on counternarcotics
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) The renewed ISAF mandate will also contain no expanded
<br>authorization for the Bundeswehr soldiers to engage in
<br>counternarcotics (CN) interdiction in Afghanistan. According
<br>to xxxxxxxxxxxx, the Chancellery supported
<br>including language to expand ISAF CN tasks in the Bundestag
<br>mandate, but was pushed back by DefMin Jung. At this stage,
<br>
<br>German officials remain opposed to a Bundeswehr lead role in
<br>CN interdiction operations. xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>told the DCM that Germany would try to support the temporary
<br>"opt in" arrangement endorsed by NATO Defense Ministers at
<br>their October 9-10 meeting in Budapest. He saw potential
<br>problems, including with the Bundestag, if Allies that "opt
<br>in" need to draw on common ISAF capabilities. He said
<br>assurances on this score would be helpful. The MFA has also
<br>stressed its reservations about other Allies or ISAF
<br>contributors taking a lead role in CN operations, for fear of
<br>the knock-on effects for German forces. As a result, under
<br>the renewed ISAF mandate, the Bundeswehr will be limited to
<br>the CN support activities already outlined in the current
<br>ISAF Operations Plan (OPLAN).
<br>
<br>No deadline for withdrawal
<br>
<br>¶8. (U) Peter Ramsauer, the Bundestag leader of the Christian
<br>Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor
<br>Merkel's CDU, had publicly advocated adopting an "exit
<br>strategy" and setting a timeline for the eventual withdrawal
<br>of the Bundeswehr from Afghanistan, but this was rejected by
<br>both Merkel and Steinmeier. A government spokesman said the
<br>Chancellor and Foreign Minister "were agreed that it would be
<br>irresponsible to discuss a withdrawal deadline or an end of
<br>the mandate now."
<br>
<br>Oef mandate
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) There is a separate parliamentary mandate that covers
<br>the Bundeswehr's participation in OEF, the renewal of which
<br>will be debated and voted on in November. The current
<br>mandate authorizes the deployment of up to 100 German Special
<br>Forces (KSK) in Afghanistan as well as the deployment of
<br>naval personnel and ships around the Horn of Africa. The
<br>current OEF troop ceiling is 1,400, but only about 250
<br>Bundeswehr military personnel are now deployed under the
<br>mandate, all of whom participate in the maritime mission; the
<br>KSK reportedly has not been deployed to Afghanistan under OEF
<br>in the last four years. Jung announced months ago that he
<br>planned to seek a reduction in the OEF ceiling to 800 during
<br>the next mandate renewal.
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) One of the most dramatic developments in recent
<br>weeks has been the decision of the government to eliminate
<br>the German Special Forces (KSK) element from the separate OEF
<br>parliamentary mandate when it comes up for renewal in
<br>November. Steinmeier and his Social Democratic Party (SPD)
<br>have spun this to the public as their achievement.
<br>Eliminating the controversial KSK element -- which has gone
<br>unused for the past four years -- was seen by the governing
<br>coalition as a price to pay to ensure strong parliamentary
<br>support, especially in the SPD, for renewal of the ISAF
<br>mandate. xxxxxxxxxxxx While deleting the
<br>KSK from the OEF mandate will have no practical effect on the
<br>ground in Afghanistan, it will formally end Germany's
<br>participation in OEF in Afghanistan, which could be
<br>misconstrued by some as a symbolic step back from supporting
<br>the war on terror.
<br>
<br>Total cost of mission: over 1 billion euros per year
<br>
<br>¶11. (SBU) Germany's military deployment is expected to cost
<br>almost 700 million Euros over the next year. Combined with
<br>the 140 million Euros that it has budgeted for
<br>reconstruction, development and humanitarian assistance, plus
<br>what it spends on the police training mission, Germany's
<br>total outlay per year for the mission in Afghanistan is now
<br>more than 1 billion Euros.
<br>
<br>Comment
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) Germany remains committed to the ISAF mission
<br>without time limits or conditions and has steadily increased
<br>its overall contributions and filled all the shortfalls in
<br>its region. However, up to now, it has remained unwilling to
<br>deploy combat troops outside the north. The elimination of
<br>the KSK element from the OEF mandate may open opportunities
<br>to seek greater use of German Special Forces on a
<br>country-wide basis under ISAF. The KSK is, in fact, already
<br>deployed in Afghanistan, and has been for months, but is
<br>apparently there under German national control to track down
<br>those responsible for recent attacks on the Bundeswehr. As
<br>far as we are aware, the KSK has not yet been made available
<br>to COMISAF for ISAF missions outside the north, even though
<br>such missions could be covered under the exception in the
<br>ISAF mandate. Convincing the Germans to make the KSK
<br>available for country-wide missions under ISAF would take
<br>time and would probably require direct engagement with
<br>Chancellor Merkel and FM Steinmeier. Even after general
<br>approval was received, each specific deployment outside the
<br>north would likely require the consent of DefMin Jung as
<br>specified in the ISAF mandate.
