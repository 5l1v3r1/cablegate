<br>¶C. BAGHDAD 289 
<br>
<br>Classified By: Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Patricia A. Butenis for 
<br>reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S/NF) Summary: Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - Quds 
<br>Force (IRGC-QF) officers are active in Iraq, conducting 
<br>traditional espionage and supporting violent extremists as 
<br>well as supporting both legitimate and malign Iranian 
<br>economic and cultural outreach. Iraqis and their government 
<br>have demonstrated increasing willingness to push back against 
<br>malign Iranian influence in the last year. Working with the 
<br>Iraqis, we have succeeded in stopping some IRGC-QF activity 
<br>through military operations and diplomatic engagement, while 
<br>we prevented some IRGC-QF officers from entering Iraq through 
<br>explicit warnings that we would target them unilaterally. 
<br>However, under the Security Agreement effective January 1, 
<br>all operations in Iraq must be conducted in conjunction with 
<br>Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), and our previous unilateral 
<br>warnings carry less weight. As Coalition Forces continue the 
<br>period of responsible drawdown, we will rely increasingly on 
<br>the GOI to keep the pressure on the IRGC-QF. We intend to 
<br>support the GOI in these efforts through continued diplomatic 
<br>engagement, intelligence sharing, and our security 
<br>partnership of Coalition Forces working by, with, and through 
<br>the ISF. End summary. 
<br>
<br>----------- 
<br>Background: 
<br>----------- 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S/NF) IRGC-QF leadership took advantage of the vacuum 
<br>which surrounded the fall of Saddam Hussein and the entry of 
<br>Coalition Forces into Iraq in 2003, using the opportunity to 
<br>send operatives to Iraq when little attention was focused on 
<br>Iran. In January 2007, Coalition Forces raided an unofficial 
<br>Iranian consulate in Erbil, detaining five Iranians who 
<br>claimed to be diplomats but in reality held no diplomatic 
<br>status. They were suspected of operations aimed at killing 
<br>Coalition and Iraqi security forces (refs A and B). The 
<br>original targets of the raid, IRGC-QF officers Abbas Hoseyni 
<br>(of the Erbil office) and Hormat Faruqi (of the Sulaimaniyah 
<br>office), escaped and fled to Iran. The Iranian government 
<br>immediately pulled back most IRGC-QF officers from Iraq and 
<br>shuttered its "consulates" in Erbil and Sulaymaniyah until 
<br>mid-2007; consulates in Basrah and Karbala remained open. 
<br>Since 2007, Iran has submitted diplomatic visa applications 
<br>for Hoseini and Faruqi to return to Iraq. In 2008 the 
<br>Embassy and MNF-I convinced the GOI not to approve these 
<br>applications, making it clear if they returned to Iraq, they 
<br>would be targeted by Coalition Forces. 
<br>
<br>¶3. (S/NF) Since 2008, the MFA has passed names of Iranians 
<br>applying for diplomatic visas to the US Embassy for vetting. 
<br>Background checks have revealed that about 20 percent have 
<br>possible ties to the IRGC or Iran's Ministry of Intelligence 
<br>and Security (MOIS) (ref C). The MFA has informed us that it 
<br>denies visas to all new suspected intelligence officers, but 
<br>we have not been able to verify such claims. In January 
<br>2009, the MFA passed a list of 35 names to the USG of Iranian 
<br>diplomats already in country before the vetting process 
<br>began. Of those, eight had ties to IRGC or MOIS. 
<br>
<br>-------- 
<br>Strategy 
<br>-------- 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S/NF) As U.S. forces continue a period of responsible 
<br>draw down, we will seek to ensure that the GOI understands 
<br>that IRGC-QF activity harms Iraq -- which should be 
<br>self-evident if the IRGC-QF continues to conduct malign 
<br>activity that targets Iraqi citizens and infrastructure. 
<br>Qactivity that targets Iraqi citizens and infrastructure. 
<br>Engagements with political and security leadership at the 
<br>national and provincial level, intelligence sharing, and 
<br>security cooperation will be key to explaining the dangers of 
<br>IRGC-QF activity and providing Iraqis the information they 
<br>need to defend their own interests. The following are 
<br>diplomatic, political, military, intelligence, and public 
<br>information options which either the GOI can pursue 
<br>unilaterally, or in concert with the USG, to target IRGC-QF 
<br>activity in Iraq.

<br>BAGHDAD 00001103 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (S/NF) We intend to continue working closely with the MFA 
<br>to deny visas to Iranian intelligence officers. We may also 
<br>consider suggesting that the MFA use another diplomatic tool, 
<br>albeit one with more consequences -- the "persona non grata" 
<br>designation. The MFA may be reluctant to take this step 
<br>because Iraqi diplomats in Iran would face retaliation and 
<br>the dispute would inevitably become public. Since the fall 
<br>of Saddam, the GOI has avoided most public disagreements with 
<br>Iran. 
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>Security Partnership 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S/NF) The role of the ISF in countering IRGC-QF in Iraq 
<br>is critical, yet complex. We can encourage the Iraqi Army to 
<br>take the lead on kinetic action against IRGC-QF agents, with 
<br>Iraqi police monitoring and reacting to suspicious activity 
<br>at the local level. We intend to continue to strengthen our 
<br>partnership with the ISF to counter pro-Iranian elements who 
<br>have infiltrated the security forces such as Kata'ib 
<br>Hizbollah and Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq. While the US combat mission 
<br>will end by August 31, 2009, we will continue to assist the 
<br>Ministry of Defense (MOD) with training, equipment, mentoring 
<br>and other bilateral military-to-military programs and 
<br>engagements. Military sales, such as the recent Iraqi 
<br>interest in purchasing F-16s and plans to transition from 
<br>AK-47 to M-4 rifles, will increase US influence through 
<br>training and support in Iraq for years to come, although the 
<br>MOD will continue to consider weapons purchases from other 
<br>sources as well. 
<br>
<br>--------------- 
<br>Border Controls 
<br>--------------- 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) The Department of Border Enforcement (DBE) can help 
<br>limit IRGC-QF activity by combating smuggling and 
<br>scrutinizing people and cargo crossing legitimate routes from 
<br>Iran into Iraq. XXXXXXXXXXXX corruption 
<br>at the ports of entry (POEs), unwillingness of inspectors to 
<br>do their jobs, and poor leadership and professionalism at the 
<br>supervisory level keep the DBE from being fully effective. 
<br>The USG can assist, however. Personal Identification Secure 
<br>Comparison and Evaluation System (PISCES), which checks 
<br>travelers' biographic data, is already in use at many land 
<br>and air POEs around Iraq. Additional training at sea ports, 
<br>airports, and land borders could help Iraqi officials detect 
<br>smugglers of cash, weapons, weapons components and other 
<br>contraband. An Iranian IRGC-QF officer was briefly detained 
<br>at Baghdad International Airport in November 2008 when his 
<br>name was flagged in PISCES. In January 2009, KRG's Minister 
<br>of the Interior Karim Sinjari praised PISCES and asked for 
<br>the system at two more land border entry points the KRG 
<br>shares with Iran, Khalil Ibrahim and Hadjer Meran. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) As of April 2009, there were 200 PISCES units in 
<br>operation at 15 different POEs in Iraq. Current guidance 
<br>states that every traveler entering or exiting Iraq is 
<br>processed through PISCES. On occasion however, travelers 
<br>will pay a small "fee" to enter or exit without going through 
<br>PISCES. If a potential match is found to someone on the 
<br>"stop list," the screen freezes, and only INIS can unlock the 
<br>screen and conduct a secondary inspection. INIS notifies the 
<br>GOI or USG when the identity of a wanted person is confirmed. 
<br>PISCES is operated by Immigration officers assigned to the 
<br>Department of Travel and Nationality, and the GOI will 
<br>continue to use PISCES after the military drawdown. 
<br>Collection and storage of biometric data is another tool the 
<br>QCollection and storage of biometric data is another tool the 
<br>GOI is already using at POEs, although Biometric Automated 
<br>Toolset (BAT) system is run by U.S. forces and will not stay 
<br>in Iraq after their departure. 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S/NF) A timely example of cooperation with DBE in 
<br>countering Iranian lethal aid smuggling occurred April 14. A 
<br>DBE brigade in Maysan Province, partnered with Multi-National 
<br>Division-South (MND-S) forces, captured an unmanned boat 
<br>carrying explosive devices floating in the Huwayza Marsh. 
<br>The patrol found three explosively formed projectiles (EFPs) 
<br>and other military equipment. MND-S said it was the first 
<br>time the DBE had reported success against this type of 
<br>smuggling. 
<br>
<br>-------------------- 
<br>Intelligence Sharing 
<br>-------------------- 
<br>
<br>
<br>BAGHDAD 00001103 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶10. (S/NF) Coordinating with GOI intelligence agencies to 
<br>stop IRGC-QF activity is complicated by the fact that the 
<br>Iraqi intelligence establishment is extremely fragmented. 
<br>Intelligence offices affiliated with the Ministry of the 
<br>Interior (MOI), DBE, and the Ministry of State for National 
<br>Security Affairs (MSNSA) do not trust each other and often 
<br>work in opposition. The USG could further assist Iraqi 
<br>intelligence by negotiating and approving a bilateral 
<br>US-Iraqi intelligence sharing agreements and further 
<br>providing the GOI with intelligence that demonstrates the 
<br>involvement of IRGC-QF officers in lethal assistance to 
<br>extremists. US Forces in Iraq have established positive 
<br>relationships with their ISF counterparts and are developing 
<br>appropriate intelligence-sharing mechanisms. The USG can also 
<br>assist the GOI to further develop its intelligence 
<br>infrastructure to monitor malign Iranian influence and 
<br>counter the IRGC-QF. INIS currently interacts closely with 
<br>the Office of Regional Affairs (ORA). The establishment of a 
<br>Defense Attach's Office at the Embassy will also help 
<br>facilitate intelligence sharing and is under consideration by 
<br>Chief of Mission. 
<br>
<br>------------------- 
<br>Public Information 
<br>------------------- 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S/NF) Highlighting nefarious Iranian activity to GOI 
<br>leadership and the Iraqi public has had a significant impact 
<br>on increasing GOI willingness to confront Iran, as well as 
<br>public rejection of Iranian attempts to dominate Iraq's 
<br>political and economic sectors. Provincial elections 
<br>demonstrated that perceived fealty to Iran is a political 
<br>liability for Iraqi politicians, and they are increasingly 
<br>sensitive to it. Continued USG assistance in uncovering and 
<br>publicizing Iranian attempts to influence events in Iraq will 
<br>make the country a much more inhospitable environment for 
<br>IRGC-QF operatives. 
<br>
<br>------- 
<br>Comment 
<br>------- 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S/NF) The Iranian government may sense that the drawdown 
<br>of U.S. military forces in Iraq presents an opportunity to 
<br>expand IRGC-QF activity, although the broader regional 
<br>dynamic will undoubtedly also influence Iranian decision 
<br>making. Without the ability to conduct unilateral military 
<br>action against IRGC-QF operatives in Iraq, we will leverage 
<br>our evolving diplomatic, intelligence, security, and military 
<br>partnerships with Iraq to maintain pressure. Many USG 
<br>agencies will be involved in assisting the Iraqis in this 
<br>critical area, and must actively engage in order to counter 
<br>IRGC-QF officers and their lethal aid.
