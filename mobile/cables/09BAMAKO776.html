<br>
<br>SUMMARY 
<br>
<br>¶1. (S) On November 27 the Ambassador and Commander of the 
<br>U.S. Africa Command, General William E. ("Kip") Ward, met 
<br>with Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure (ATT) to discuss 
<br>security in Northern Mali. ATT reiterated his commitment to 
<br>take action against Al Q'Aida in the Lands of the Islamic 
<br>Maghreb, now possibly in January. General Ward encouraged 
<br>the President to follow through with convening the Bamako 
<br>Summit. ATT indicated he plans to travel to Algiers to meet 
<br>with Algerian President Bouteflika to set the date , 
<br>demonstrate his commitment and gain his support. ATT and 
<br>General Ward agreed that, with or without regional 
<br>cooperation, Mali has no choice but to move forward in 
<br>confronting terrorist and criminal elements in the North. 
<br>
<br>THANKS FOR SUPPORT WITH HARD LANDING 
<br>
<br>¶2. (S) On November 27 the Ambassador and U.S. Africa 
<br>Command General William E. ("Kip") Ward met with Malian 
<br>President Amadou Toumani Toure (ATT). The Ambassador and 
<br>General Ward were accompanied by Foreign Policy Advisor Dr. 
<br>Raymond L. Brown and AFRICOM Public Affairs Director Colonel 
<br>Frank Childress. ATT was accompanied by Minister of Defense 
<br>Natie Pleah, Secretary General to the PresidencyDiango 
<br>Cissoko, and Chief of Defense Poudiougou. General Ward 
<br>thanked the President for Mali's support in the recent hard 
<br>landing of a plane carrying U.S. military personnel 
<br>approximately 65 miles outside of Bamako. ATT reiterated ref 
<br>A comments that it was only natural Mali should help, since 
<br>after all he knew the United States was coming to help Mali. 
<br>
<br>PROGRESS AND CONCERNS IN NORTHERN MALI 
<br>¶3. (S) ATT said that since General Ward's last visit (ref 
<br>B) the Tuareg rebellion had been brought to an end. Even the 
<br>head of the most recent rebellion has sent a message of 
<br>peace, and ten or so of the former rebels, "since they like 
<br>to fight so much" are being sent off to support the African 
<br>Union Mission in Somalia (see IIR 6 958 0021 10). ATT said 
<br>he had concerns about the Salafists, another term for Al 
<br>Q'Aida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). While the 
<br>Salafists have had difficulty getting their message across to 
<br>a generally reluctant population, they have had some success 
<br>in enlisting disaffected youth to their ranks. He said the 
<br>Malian Army is at a turning point, with the older generation 
<br>in the military giving way to a younger, less experienced 
<br>one. In this regard, he thanked General Ward for the 
<br>training the United States is providing to the recently 
<br>created Echelons Tactiques Inter-Arme (ETIAs). 
<br>
<br>NEED FOR MORE REGIONAL COOPERATION 
<br>
<br>¶4. (S) ATT lamented that regional cooperation appears to 
<br>be stalled. Mauritanian President Aziz is a soldier who 
<br>understands the situation. He has put the recent political 
<br>troubles behind him and is working well with Mali. Niger has 
<br>always been a good partner. Although the country has its own 
<br>Tuareg rebellion problem and is focused on a domestic 
<br>political crisis, Niger continues to work well together with 
<br>Mali. Military cooperation with Algeria is the problem. ATT 
<br>said the Algerians think we do not do anything, and they are 
<br>not totally wrong, but we need Algeria's help in terms of air 
<br>support. It is not just a matter of destroying a couple of 
<br>AQIM bases, we have to be able to hold the territory. The 
<br>longer the situation drags on, the stronger the Salafists 
<br>will get. 
<br>
<br>¶5. (S) ATT directly linked revenues from drug trafficking 
<br>to terrorism. He said the Boeing 727 which had been set fire 
<br>near Tarkint, in Northern Mali after it got stuck in the sand 
<br>on or about October 30 may have been carrying drugs. Mali 
<br>is cooperating with friendly countries to try to gain 
<br>information about the nature of the flight and has lodged 
<br>complaints about the violation of its air space with Interpol 
<br>and with the UN Office of Drugs and Crime. ATT said security 
<br>will be easier to achieve with three or four countries 
<br>
<br>BAMAKO 00000776 002 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>working together rather than alone. If the other countries 
<br>cannot agree, then of course we have to do it ourselves, he 
<br>said. 
<br>
<br>UNITED STATES COMMITTED TO HELP 
<br>
<br>¶6. (S) General Ward thanked the President for catching him 
<br>up on the situation. He said he is happy to hear of the 
<br>President's continued commitment to fighting terrorism. If 
<br>the government of Mali is unable to gain better control over 
<br>under-governed territory, it will continue to give free reign 
<br>to arms and drug traffickers and terrorists, frustrating 
<br>legitimate development efforts. General Ward said that, with 
<br>Ambassador Milovanovic, we are paying close attention to how 
<br>we can increase the capacity of the Malian Army to eliminate 
<br>the threat posed. The United States is looking to ensure a 
<br>continuum of training and maintenance capacity building. 
<br>Keeping trained units together and using the equipment 
<br>provided in a sustainable manner will help Mali achieve its 
<br>goals. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (S) General Ward said he shares ATT's analysis that the 
<br>bad guys do not respect borders and that Mali needs regional 
<br>cooperation. Having just come from Algeria, General Ward 
<br>said he had made the same point to Algerian President 
<br>Abdelaziz Bouteflika, as well as to the Algerian Ministers of 
<br>Foreign Affairs and Defense, and to the Chief of Defense: 
<br>all agreed to the need for regional cooperation. General 
<br>Ward said he would be looking for signs of increased 
<br>cooperation on the ground. 
<br>
<br>¶8. (S) The USG supports the implementation and follow-on 
<br>to the meeting of Chiefs of Defense in Tamanrassett, Algeria 
<br>as well as the heads of state meeting in Bamako. General 
<br>Ward said he hopes the joint operations center discussed in 
<br>Tamanrassett will become a reality soon, and will be able to 
<br>support operations in the North of Mali. Once the operations 
<br>center becomes a reality, the USG stands ready to assist with 
<br>training and equipment if asked, as well as providing 
<br>transparent updates on U.S. security engagement with regional 
<br>partners. General Ward said he was very impressed by ATT's 
<br>statement that, whether or not the neighbors get involved in 
<br>a constructive manner, he would be taking responsibility for 
<br>security in the North. "When that step is taken, no one will 
<br>be able to say you have not done anything." 
<br>
<br>MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER 
<br>
<br>¶9. (S) The President said he shares General Ward's views. 
<br>He noted the frank and excellent working relationship he has 
<br>with Ambassador Milovanovic, noting wryly that he is 
<br>sometimes embarrassed by, but always appreciates, her 
<br>directness. Returning to security questions, he described 
<br>his childhood memory of "the dance of death" from the village 
<br>in which he grew up: If you dance too far ahead, you die; if 
<br>you dance too far behind, you die; if you do not dance at 
<br>all, you die. That is the way it is in the fight against the 
<br>Salafists, he said. We have no choice but to move ahead 
<br>together. 
<br>
<br>¶10. (S) Chief of Defense General Gabriel Poudiougou 
<br>mentioned that the Algerian Special Forces Commander had just 
<br>left Bamako November 26 after a two day visit in which he 
<br>worked with his Malian counterparts to establish a 
<br>transmission network and a better cooperative working 
<br>arrangement on the ground. Colonel Amadou Gueye, in charge 
<br>of military cooperation at the MOD, said that a mixed 
<br>committee for joint military cooperation has been set up, and 
<br>the fourth meeting is scheduled for December 15 in Tessalit, 
<br>Mali. It is to be attended by an Algerian General. ATT said 
<br>he is planning a trip to Algiers to ask Bouteflika for air 
<br>support, shortly after the Tessalit meeting. 
<br>
<br>ATT THOUGHTS ON ALGERIA 
<br>
<br>¶11. (S) ATT then asked the Ambassador and General Ward if 
<br>he could speak to them privately. In that meeting, he 
<br>mentioned that he had gone to see Libyan leader Muammar 
<br>al-Qadhafi and, contrary to the view of some, he is the most 
<br>interested of all in a head of state summit in Bamako. ATT 
<br>said that, after Tabaski (November 28), he will be going to 
<br>see President Bouteflika and sending Malian Foreign Minister 
<br>
<br>BAMAKO 00000776 003 OF 003 
<br>
<br>
<br>Moctar Ouane to the other countries to find a date for the 
<br>summit. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (S) ATT said he believes Bouteflika and the Algerian 
<br>leadership genuinely want to cooperate, although they have 
<br>real doubts about Mali's resolve. His visit is intended 
<br>inter alia to dispel these doubts. ATT said he thinks 
<br>Algeria's intelligence services and army are holding up 
<br>cooperation, and believes the Algerian army is infiltrated 
<br>with Salafists. He is nevertheless pleased with the improved 
<br>cooperation with Algeria, and said a lot is riding on 
<br>concrete outcomes of the December 15 meeting in Tessalit. He 
<br>wants the heads of state summit to take place first, and then 
<br>to be prepared to start operations within a week or so. This 
<br>implies that the cooperation already has to be working, in 
<br>advance of the summit. 
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX 
<br>
<br>XXXXXXXXXXXX
<br>
<br>¶15. (S) General Ward said the United States will continue 
<br>to support Mali's efforts with training and equipment. He 
<br>pledged to follow up with the Algerians, telling them how 
<br>important the next delegation meeting is, and conveying ATT's 
<br>commitment. 
<br>
<br>¶16. (U) General Ward cleared this message.
